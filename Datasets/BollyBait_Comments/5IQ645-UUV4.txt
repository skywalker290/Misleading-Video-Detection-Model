&quot;Is there a mode of transportation apart from a Rolls-Royce?&quot;<br> <br>Me, walking everywhere I go: Yeh bhi theek hai.
Inko toh main janta bhi nahi 😂😂
Is it real or scripted?
Bhai ameer ghar mai paida hone ke liye kya krna hoga.
Old and acting like mean girls .. not cool at all..
Ye flop heroes की wife है पैसा कहां से आता he इनके paas
😬😬😂😂
Actually thanks to Netflix for showing their true colours.. 😂😂😂😂
@NetflixIndiaOfficial congrats on putting up a show of bunch of wannabe&#39;s.
Hollywood ka cheapest version.....❤❤❤
aunti&#39;s show
Comments don’t match the vibe 👎🏽
Women with no class whatsoever. I d rather be in a cage with chickens than these women. Neelam is the only one who has some dignity.
Just my curiosity i watch 1 episode. Just first 10min i cannot take it due to abusive talk, mean talking etc. Ok bye
Berozgar wives of bollywood
So wannabe like way too much….sickening i swear I couldn’t do 1 episode……<br>Not cool not good especially that women is so not herself Sanjay Kapoor’s wife <br>She is cringy af
Bunch of losers
slumdogs
This is such a cheap Real housewives rip off. Gosh im not even gon watch it. Juat came here to drop the comment
indian version of keeping up with the Kardashians....
This is a kind of show for Big Boss audience.....👀 Take this statement which ever way you like
Another stupid fucking show for the retards of america
Kardashians don&#39;t even know your name bruhhh 💀
So disgusting this wives.. specifically sanjay kapoor&#39;s wife
Copy of four more shots please /Keeping up with Kardashians
Maheep&#39;s jealousy: OMG.
चौथी फैल।
By the way sanjay kapoor was like piche lokhand wala nhi dikhna chahiye take a nice picture lagna chahiye that we are in paris
I go on netflix to relax a bit after being exhausted from life and this is what netflix recommends me i had to come here to point out this issue since you dont have visible rating on netflix its just sad man
Very bad
It really hurts to watch Neelam in such video after  watching her in beautiful songs of Hatya Sindoor Kasak Paap Ki Duniya etc but why shall she care for fan&#39;s feelings?
EAST-INDIANS REALLY DO believe that having money, and LOADS of it, <br>COMPLETELY EXEMPTS them from being decent, responsible, accountable, HUMANE human beings. IN THEIR MINDS, it (money) &quot;earns&quot; them what THEY CHOOSE TO CONSIDER that &quot;right&quot;.<br>NO WONDER the vast majority of their population is so frighteningly destitute and Bollywood SO-CALLED movie stars can casually mow down homeless, poor people - THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN, NO LESS - and NEVER be prosecuted, NEVERMIND CONVICTED in what is SUPPOSED TO BE a Court of Law.
A show about the mundane, inane, insane, assinine, opaque and USUALLY,  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL. It makes &quot;Keeping up with the Kardashians&quot; look like a Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone or Martin Scorsese epic masterpiece. Hope Virat Kohli and &quot;the Mrs.&quot; don&#39;t watch. What a gargantuan waste of time, energy and money. AND I DO KNOW JUST HOW MUCH East-Indians IDOLIZE MONEY. Their NO. 1 god.<br>TIME, once lost, cannot be regained, you know.<br>CLEARLY, the nation of INDIA DOES HAVE a whole lot of (Disposable) Income in its&#39; coffers, but, alas, none to spare for its&#39; legions of DESPERATELY and DISPERATELY IMPOVERISHED, DISENFRANCHISED AND DISAFFECTED.
L show wannabe of the Kardashians frfr 💀
Indians think ignoring gem of own culture tradition and language food and adapting good for nothing western culture is their freedom if this continues all western people itself will laugh the whole world will laugh on Indian because no country in the world is ignoring their own language and speaking English except for india
KUWTK sasta version 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best series I have seem in recent times ❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=105">1:45</a> enough to destroy all the bollywood so called couples
Wishing to see aryan khan and suhana khan together in fabulous lives of bollywood wives season 3🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I really like this show🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
The longer I live on this planet, the more I understand why roosters start their day screaming.
Ye isko kuch n mila bnane to kuch bhi khichdi bna dege kya
Maheep maam goes like to bhavna maam  Shut up bitch 😂 epic epic
I wouldn&#39;t call it a fabulous life
Thank God I didn&#39;t grew up with pair of parents that&#39;s this pretentious
Cringe cringe. Women who.actually work for their money will laugh at their faces. This trailer is as far as my mild  curiosity will allow me. They are not beautiful,  not talented, so who are they???
Dumb bi**h calling other women stupid cow.
Bhavna has class..she is natural.
Maker of this show got nerves of Those Indian audiance &quot; Who are wanna be rich and learn lifestyle from Bollywood&quot; ..... Thats why it&#39;s a hit show ....
Only one word &quot;Garbage&quot;.
I don&#39;t have Netflix and don&#39;t know wat this series is about,can anyone explain wat kind of reality show is this...wat r takeaways
These girls should learn something from Sudha Murthy 🙏
Bina mehnat ke agar kisike paas paisa jyada aajaye toh kya karna chahiye in aurton se sikhna chahiye......ishiliye Netflix ye series laya hai 😅🤣 wah NF walon wah...
Why cant they talk in their native languages
What&#39;s the song used in the trailer- Girls do it better
Bhavna oh god 🤣
It looks like they r copying the Kardashians show😂
Very entertaining programme.  Something different.
After watching an episode i can comment <br>Empty vessel sound more <br>The poor rich people
Comment sections is more happening than entire two seasons
Sasta Kardashian show, more over all bgrade and failed actors wives.
These women are whores. They really set unrealistic standard for other women in the society. Nobody needs these useless shows with multiple season. These women should spend time with their daughter and sons instead of showcasing their rich yet hollow lives.
Name of the show should be <br>&quot; FABULOUS LIVES OF BOLLYWOOD &#39;S KUJJALIWALI BUDIYAS &quot;<br>please change it !!
Who said they only have glamorous life ? Who said glamorous ???
It seems some aliens are trying to be happy...
Cringe
Uurrggghhhh like literally trying to copy like the American show . Annoying they should have atleast take civilian people and made them not the wife of useless
Band Karo
Just saw an advertisement of the season 2 of this circus. (Didn’t know season 1 existed) and immediately switched on to YouTube for season 1 trailer and particularly the comment section 😂😂😂😂
Sanjay kapoor n chunky I found they are never big stars...why their wives behave like angrez ki aolad???
Oh my God! <br>How do i like every comment 😂
Copying&#39; Keeping up with the Kardashians &#39;show
It&#39;s Really CRINGE. Do they think anyone&#39;s gonna watch this Sh*t. FFS, Come on man, @Netflix India, GROW UP and give us some good content. It&#39;s INDIA, NOT USA.  No Kim Kardasian or whatever is gonna work here. Bring some Good Quality Content for once man. Then people will watch your sh*t.
I don&#39;t think maheep kapoor is too rich
I actually watched the whole season last night I didn&#39;t hate it I like the way was more fun about their relationships, and supporting each other wasn&#39;t too much drama and people just fighting over stupid things. I really enjoyed it!
I don&#39;t care what people say but i occasionally enjoys shows like this😂😂 full drama, controversy, entertainment and a lot of cringy statements🔥😂
It’s a train wreck I agree with the comments but why can’t I stop watching this bullshit??
DISGRACEFUL !!!! In a country that languishing in poverty these SICK women have nothing better to do than flash their wealth and their skinny arses, PATHETIC !!!!
Cant imagine a brand like Netflix associating its name with such wanabees.
Watching milfs on Netflix. Who asked for these irrelevant twaddle.
Neelam and Bhavna ar sweet but other two women are super cringy
the only good thing about this was gauri khan
These people lives are just like movie page3
No matter how hard tou try you can never copy west. It&#39;s something should run in blood. Following kardashians? give me a break you can&#39;t even reach to their door step forget about looking like em. No wonder most star kids looks like defected pieces
Thanks bhaiya
idiotic woman who are lusty 😂😂😂😂
Finally an answer to why we can&#39;t tell the Ananyas and Shanayas of Bollywood apart. They all live the same achingly dull life.
The comments r hillarrious 🤣
For one time in life <br>I’m happy to see negative comments about this <br><br>This is utter toxic
Its like a keeping up with Kim kardashians wives version
Kaun log hain aisa amir gharo ka chutoyappa dekhte hain
In 4 of these ladies maheep mam is 2 years younger than my mother and seema mam is 2 years is elder than my mother and 2 years younger than my father
Saud Syed always rocks 💥
Keeping up with kapoor
Apart from other three , that cringe lady Bhavana pandey responsible for giving us padanya andey
I Like It more Hollywood wives of 1985
Got disappointed inspite of not having expectations....
W H A T    T H E    F U C K ? ?
When tanmays video about this show has more views than this show..
Let me reframe the sentence for y&#39;all -<br>I occasionally dm Kim Kardashian and i occasionally left unanswered 🤣
Meanwhile Ratan Tata after this - Hold my Tata Namak <br>(it&#39;s turnover is more than your net worth combined lol 😂)
Wannabe Kardashians are trying so hard to seem effortlessly cool but are end up looking like fool lol 😂
Alternative title - Desperate Lives of Whitewashed Wives
people&#39; s money,  Jantas money wasting Aramse and Showing that to Janta Aramse <br><br>what a joke,  this show and these people Both
kya hai ye?
so  loud voices they talk to much and they talk  together  very annoying.. headach... 😣
Netflix backs these stupid shows and then wonders why it&#39;s losing so many subscribers
Cheap!
Hahahahhaahah🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought they are classy as they are rich wives, but someone keeps showing her middle finger.. 🤢🤢🤢
No doubt they are losing subscribers
Cheapest copy of Beverly Hills and Kardashians show
They wanted to make something like KUWTK .. but this is 🤢
This trailer reminds the movie sex and the city
I just waste my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=136">2:16</a> minutes... And a minute to write this comment.<br>How foolish I am.🤦🏻‍♂️
I actually love this show. They turn out to be very fun, down to earth, so much fun ❤️
Seema mam it&#39;s not about you dming Kim Kardashian it&#39;s if she replies to you back
Fell asleep two seconds in
Say what you want but i thoroughly enjoyed this show . I mean in peak lockdown i don&#39;t want to see something stressful or something depressing. This was the perfect cheat meal kind of show . And also why would you not want to see what goes on in Bollywood. I would rather watch Ananya Panday s glamarous life THAN her in a movie .
Middle aged aunties and wives of unsuccessful Bollywood actors ...oh ofcourse mothers of highly cringe lame dumb talent lesss daughters
as soon as i watched this,i knew the comment section would be flooded about what 🙃 like why do they even pay any heed to them
Hey bhagwan Ye sab kya dekhna par raha ...accha  hai mai soo raha huu😴
Now the aunt&#39;s going to make
With all due of respect, Maheep Kapoor has this early 20s behaviour. Especially the way she showed her middle finger 🖕🏾. Really? 🤔
Just one thing to say for this...sasta Keeping up with the Kardashians🤡
Cheap thrills. The Indian version of the Kardashians. Never a good thing. We&#39;re headed into the gutter with this.
I don&#39;t envy this people. But its cringe instead.
❤️
👍
Please make in English.... In Hindi fucks
Now i won&#39;t blame Ananya for her overacting what could you expect from a girl raised by just crazy absurd mother<br>If we would have such parents especially mothers for sure we would be like Ananya or other nepo products <br>Nothing is going to last forever<br>Whether it&#39;s your rolls Royce<br>Your luxurious buildings<br>Expensive clothes <br>Your age <br>Nothing 🤣🤣<br>So let them do this so called show &quot; fabulous lives of flop bollywood actors wives&quot;
That was so stupid of maheep to say that the only transportation she has is a Rolls Royce, i mean public transport is available so you can use it anytime!!<br>Bizarre show with stupid arrogant aunties.
Neelam mam is come back.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
These women are so lucky yaar❤️. They hv amazing life🔥. Even though none of their husbands were superstars or even stars,I wonder how they r so rich. They all were the biggest flop actors of the 90&#39;s and 00&#39;s ,yet they r starwives and their kids, starkids?And Neelam kothari is not a bollywood wife. She is more famous than her husband Samir soni. He is not even a bollywood actor,he is more of a television actor while Neelam has been a star since the 80&#39;s. He shud be lucky Neelam being more successful married him . So calling her a bollywood wife is disrespectful to her. And yes she shud come back to movies. she was good. But its fun to watch this. This is a part of India which most of us can only imagine.<br>P.s Ignore all the hate in the comments. These r just jealous people who envy them and hate them for being rich. Dude instead of commenting here do some work so that u and ur family can get a life like this. Stop hating others for being rich. Insecure people!
The language they use to try and look trendy, makes your persona trashy! &quot;a foul tongue reveals a lot more about you than the one you are using it against&quot;.
Seema: people have this misconception that we have a oh-so-glamorous life, but it’s not true. Our lives can be quite mundane.<br>Cut to all four wives getting off Rolls Royce in front of Galeries Lafayette, the most luxurious mall in Doha. How mundane <b>facepalm</b>
&quot;Netflix India- an adopted child of Bollywood&#39;s dumbest and cringiest actors&quot;🤡<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Sorry, did I called them actors oops 🤠!
I cant imagine living a life like that of star kids. A life without any purpose, a life where everything is given to you in a golden plate( i mean everything that can be bought with money). Where is the challenge , where are the ups and downs, where is the happiness and pride of achieving something on your own. I know why this series was made because without this they will all be forgotten, this is the only was there will be some trace of them in history even though it is a laughable trace.<br>The best thing to show off is your smartness, your contribution to society and your field. Live to do honorable things.
i watched only last episode srk entry
What the actual f**k is wrong with Netflix??
These illiterate angutachaps 🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Seriously, people make series on this topic. who are those people who want to watch this series?
isint awkward when ppl ask us for suggestions and then abuse us for it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=118">1:58</a> the reaction of that guy is worth the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=136">2:16</a> mins of my life
stop tryin to be like the kardashians
Please mark down key points. Upsc 2022 me aa skta hai. Best of luck guys
Everybody say noooo~
Kisi housewife ko car driver ki jarurat hu mes me
Why this show even exist? 😂 it should be banned 🚫 it shouldn&#39;t exist. Nobody is interested in this.
Is there any other mode of transportation woman jst open ur eyes...
Show name should be budiyas of bollywood 😂😂
THE ONLY GOOD PART WAS SHAH RUKH KHAN HERE
Very disappointed!! ( American carbon copies) all bleached indians looking white and races no darkers people in the show, trying to show beauty by being all light skinned ( ideal of beauty) This show is disgrace to our sociaty. The worst part is No traditional clothing) Next!!!!! From USA.
Copied content from BLING EMPIRE
We&#39;re actually very ridiculous.... <br>Me : Very true aunty jii !!
Best show...
These women looks like the real life version of those 3 rich friends in hum saath saath hain
Better watch Ekta Kapoor&#39;s serials than this nonsense
Too bad I don&#39;t get the satisfaction of seeing the number of dislikes.
This gives me Keeping Up With The Kardashians vibes... Anyone else?
Worst show ever
Hamari mummia real life wife hai 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=99">1:39</a>–what work?
U guys might hate on this but i actually find tis funny esp Maheep kapoor omg what even stalking ppl. Dont we all at least have that one Indian aunty tat stalks ppl hahahahah
I like only neelam part and acting in this web series
A classic mix of big boss and kuwtk ewww
Stupidity at its best!! Mundane how???🤣🤣 they freaking have servants for everything!!😒😑
OMG..pathétique so stupid. Where did you get those stuff🇫🇷🗼eh merde
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=15">0:15</a> &quot;Our lives can be quite mundane&quot;<br><b>Rolls Royce comes in</b>
Ewww
I’m here just for the comments
Indian version of real housewives of Beverly Hills? Huh
Who are these people I know only one of them
Today I realised how high class my thoughts n actions are are even my life is full of meanings and productive activities ..they all were just sounding so sooo cringe that even tik-tokers were lott better then these GAVAAAR <br>OR high -class gavaar....<br>They only have money n no brain ,<br>Self-worth<br>😂😂😂🤣<br><br>Aryan case clearly shows their intellectual power of defining btw rights n wrongs that is why all most whole bollywood supported sharukh khan&#39;s boy action of drug consuming...<br><br><br><br>Oh god!! 😂😂..<br>Honestly I was soo embarrassed for these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=136">2:16</a> min
Why do ananya and shanaya talking like these??Maheep is such a drama queen bullying others make her feel powerful.Amomg all of them neelam is decent and smart
For those who are criticizing it&#39;s we who are promoting them following them praising them blah blah about them and do gossips about them and finally come back complaining about them and this continues to go on and on and on.. We won&#39;t stop and so do they..
Netflix, if you have so much money to waste, please donate it to solving hunger and poverty, instead of torturing people with such shows.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=85">1:25</a> &amp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=118">1:58</a> guys r so cute, what&#39;s his name ?
These are most toxic people I have seen in 2 minutes
Ye ka bawasir bana diye ho!!!!!!
This season was my guilty pleasure, it was too much fun honestly speaking!
They are trying really hard to be Kardashians 🙄
💩
This was super cringe lol
I’m Canadian with parents from Punjab. I was raised to respect my culture. As a Canadian, and comparing this show with other Western versions of it, I am proud of this show. No matter what, these women took the time and had the decency to respect one another. They are far more advanced in their sisterhood and respecting women than any of their Western counterparts. I get sick watching Western women hate on each other and show gross levels of insecurity. These women at least showed the world what sisterhood is. Bravo!
These people do not have money American upper middle class at best.
The comment section here,is more fun😂
The only good thing about this is &quot;Sanjay Kapoor&quot;, rest all just look weird,thinking they look cute and classy!
Trying so hard to copy kardashians
Lol, cringiest show, Netflix ever created 😂😂
It&#39;s actually the north indians themselves are irritated with these people....I mean what their husbands are doing????)
They can stalk everyone, If some other person stalks then it is scary.
This is my favourite favourite show, I love it!!!!
Well I tried to ignore , but Just couldn&#39;t. Now I regret.
Pretty but so loud and too much swearing. For me when someone is cursing, she/he has no class.
I would rather go watch keeping up with the kardashians. That looks less staged than this
The Kardashian are morons are so are these idiots. The world is suffering and these whiners are making fool out of themselves.
Looks like dey r trying hard der hands on English 😂😂😂😂 i cn say trying der tongue on English 🤣
Am sure to make this series v less money hv been spent, cuz all d families r frm flop actors with kids😂😂😂
This is just aunties trying to look younger lol 🤣🤣🤣
i liked it much better then the kardashians show they were more vulgar then these woman but indians always like to hater on their own.
Netflix India&#39;s standard is getting low day by day
I wacth it and although that I’m not Indian , I am pretty sure that it’s not like millionaires in India looks like. Those ladies was rude the entire time I was waiting for something classy or cultural but no.👀
When Netflix scrapes the barrel...it really.. really... scrapes the barrel😒
Fabulous lives of Bollywood wives- Subeh utho, makeup karo, gossip karo, khana khao, skincare routine follow karo, so jao
Karan&#39;s inner circle !
Neelam is not a bollywood wife. She is an ex actress. Wth knows her husband?
This maheep women is so desperately trying to be western its a joke ....so cringe
I am here only for comments
inke husbands ko to kuch kaam nai mila, to inhoney socha hoga, chalo mauka mila hai, humhi kuch kamaa lete hai :D
what r the bg songs can anyone say me pls
Best milfs of bollywood
bandh karo ye haat jor ke guzaris karta hu
These women tend to showcase themselves as independent working women and yet earn both footage and money by emphasizing that they are &#39;Bollywood wives&#39;! Such hypocrisy!
Bollywood wives :- oh we are the richest <br>Nita Ambani :- Hold my beer
When these married ladies decide to go on vacation, they should get trained on how to be in SINGLE mode and flirt/enjoy in complete openness ladies vacation mode.  As it is stress levels are super high during marraige and mommy mode.
Anyone who knows about the music being used here on the trailer?
Waste of time
Bullshit show
Dear Netflix! Did you decline the great Indian kitchen instead of this? I don&#39;t know whether I should cry or laugh,I have made myself swear to never comment anything negative for somebody&#39;s creative content in SM and here I am!! All because of you Netflix India,all cos of you :D
Is this in India??🙂
Will there be a next season 💀<br>I&#39;m waiting for that ;-)
The only person that was like able and somewhat bearable was Neelam hands down. Else these petty creatures can only speak in english who lacks basic education and a class. Also don’t understand why they flaunt their English while insulting hindi. Dude you still have to work in India and speak hindi in movies to fill your pockets and live your extravagant lives. People should really stop watching their children movies.  They suck up middle class people of India and still make fun of them. Well money can’t buy class.
It doesn’t mean you have money and good English your attitude and your class is zero and stop copying kardashion they don’t copy someone they are doing this thing since 2006 and you say your life is not fabulous you all are lyer you have mansions in Juhu beach worth 3 crore and 2 crore and you guys do nothing sit and bitching about actors and actresses little and spoil brats
Kya h ye...🙃🙃
eww shallow af
This is literally the CHEAPEST version of KUWTK in the entire UNIVERSE .......LOL😂😂
Maheep Kapoor&#39;s standards are definitely much lower than kim.k&#39;s heels......
They are trying hard to be ✨iconic ✨
Netflix India ! Ihad better expectations from you . I never expected Netflix to become Bollywood 🙄
this could be better if they actually showed the real life ,what do they do except spending their husband&#39;s money and producing nepokids
It&#39;s really funny to watch. They all are very dumb 🤣
Eish.... What a waste of time. The comments here was so much more entertaining 😆😆😆
Idk why bollywood loves to copy hollywood this show is holy and soly copy of keeping up with karadishians they think we r fool that we will not know🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣copycats
And that&#39;s how you make others feel inferior about their lives.. How did they agreed to do this?
I came here after knowing Farina and Dongin watch these shows as ..........😭😭😭😭im embarrassed
Who they think they are???!?!?!??
Please respect their struggles. One of thems dad has never been of koffee with karan! Do people realise how hard that is?
Nepo mummies 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sale chutiyeh log kabhi Hindi bolte hi nhi hin
Who even thought this was  a good idea now the star kids will get even 10000x more hate lol
Stop scaring ppl pandemic is enough for us cant take this
Who wants to see this bunch of crap? Bollywood has anyways crumbled. Who wants to see the mothers whose daughters are incompetent to even be in the movies? I mean the children are reflections of their parents after all
Why has bollywood to copy so much resemblance with sex and the city and Kardashians
Ok enough! now where are the actual rich bollywood wives that seem much more humble and real 🙄
Not gonna lie , netflix just made this show so that it could atlease make sense in the comment session..because the sarcasm down below is the only worth the money stuff happened for the entire shitty show
Cringing level<br>⬇️
This series proves money can not buy education, manner, class, good habits, knowledge and respect
This show is not but making fool of people
They are serverd on bed for high class people in Dubai India etc
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩Is all i c
This is so scripted..... 🤦🏻‍♀️
Honestly I guess Neelam is the only one who&#39;s a bit humble soul among these four😅😇
People who watched this really need to rethink their life&#39;s choices.
This makes me proud that I wasn&#39;t born in any bollywood family
I didn&#39;t know these so called &quot; wives &quot; till two days ago
This is the laziest copy of anything hollywood... like why would you do that... all Bollywood can do these days is copy from other sources
I must say this is similar to desperate housewives.
Loved this ❤❤❤
If I watched this crab ill definitely watch only for NEELAM....gouri some times looks so .........🤢🤮
Ohh mere sastain Kardashian.
The Only Good part was SRK
Budhiya Sab.. 🐖🐖
The swear words too 90&#39;s
Neelam is a star..
Like seriously?
It appears to be some cheap version of sex in the city... I don&#39;t wanna waste my time here. Bye.
Where is nita?
So we have shows like this in the world but Anne with an E doesn’t get a season 4 wow
I knew they are overrated nobody&#39;s but it was fun too
Rejecting &quot;The Great Indian Kitchen&quot; movie and giving platform to such trash.OMG what happening to Netflix😡😣
People think,&quot; We have such a glamorous lives&quot; , and I am like &quot; People don&#39;t think about you, go get a reality check&quot;
I already knew what to expect,but I still watched to confirm my thought: only light skinned indians.  Representation or diversity is an unknown word in some societies..sad. it would have been nice for ONCE to see a succesful dark indian woman
Everything is scripted....and i think this is the Indian version of  KUWTK and a mixture of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills
OH...GOD....NO!!!!!!
I really like Neelam<br>She is the only one who is genuine and nice  on this show
Idk.... but why are they copying the KARDASHIANS and The REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS....I think they watch everyday  to learn how to act...
so basically they signed up to troll themselves?
I want more seasons of this fantastic show!! I love bollywood!
all of them are DRUGGIES for sure
Kitna western hai ye log ,bas yahoo dikhane ke liye ye show banaya hai.....but it does not suit them...show some real women who knows our Indian culture
I knew that Netflix is the best ott platform. <br>But this show is the most stupid show I have ever seen. Are they want to tell us that spending lots of money is a tough job. <br>👎👎👎👎👎😡😡😡😡😡😂😂😂😂😂😂
if they were trashing each other  and exposing each other you all would have loved it.  they are just having fun and  I like it.
Yeh chaar hai kom
imagine....yeh log chunkey panday and sanjay kapoor pe showoff kar rahe hai.......srk anil kapoor bachaans still fine .....   i mean they wanted to make indian version  of keeping up with the kardashians...they will never pull it off and just for the sake of one of the aunties... there is nothing bad in being rich but just dont expect us as audience to like talentless people like u.... kuch padhai karvake apne baccho ko koi job karvao atleast kuch toh respect kamvaogee.........
Only Bhavana was good.. rest are 🙄
JUST CAME TO KNOW THE REASON WHY STARKIDS ARE SUCH DUMBOS !!🤷🤷
🐂 💩
It&#39;s disgusting
I puked.
The worst things is that being an Indian they feel shy to speak in hindi com on why we are watching them
BB ki vines brought me here !
Kon kon bb ki vines dekhne ke bad jha aya hai 😂
I feel sorry for you if your paying to watch this crap
Suddenly I&#39;m having great respect for the Kardashians
BB ki video dekhne ke baad Kon Kon aaya h trailer dekhne
&quot;Money can only buy happiness for people who earned it themselves.<br>For their family, it makes them deficit in what  is more important, being themselves. They are, in most arbitration, slaves to a facade identity, which dictates their lives till they do realise how wealth caged and extinguished their lives in the most compassionate manner&quot;<br>~A billionaire who wrote a book in which he said why did he donate all of his wealth and gave his son 1000$ to live his life
People are just drifting from the topic calling the husbands non-famous and all I mean why the unnecessary hatred. The title nowhere says that they are famous, it&#39;s says they are bollywood wives not famous wives. Let us all not be jealous and agree that they all have Hella lot money and fame. But the main point here should be if it&#39;s right to make a complete series out of it? No!! That should be the cause of objection.
<b>If monumental blunder had a face.</b>
Alrighty actually waiting for season 2.........🌼💀
Honestly it wasn’t as bad as the comment section is commenting it💀😂 it’s actually entertaining 😂 currently in eps 5 :)
Who are these ladies, are they even for real?<br>Sorry to say but no substance , just cringe .
the mohale vaali aunties are better than these &quot;modern&quot; aunties lmfao
I wish to die
Classy people have simplicity,poise and grace. These wannabe aunties are trying too hard because maybe they have been given a script or something, it&#39;s even worse if they are actually like this for real 😂
Ridiculous chep
Kinda liked Bhavana. She is as desperate to succeed as the other three but at least she keeps it classy. Maheep ki baatein sunn ke felt like nas kaat loon apni.
I’ve never hated anyone so quickly before
Now I realise one thing they only live on the name of their husband... they don&#39;t have  there own identity....
Does anyone know the name of the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=91">1:31</a>
Idk man I m lowkey excited to watch it 😂
Love it, best housewives of all, they are funny and their husbands are involved..  I&#39;m addicted
is there any other mode of transportation? ji aunty ji hai na? auto ,bus , train kitna batau
I wish bill burr takes a dig at this crap
Aunties hindi bolne me sharam aati hai kya toh phir Hollywood me chale jao lol!...
All wives are Punjabi accept neelam ji
God, Bollywood really IS obsessed with itself, isn&#39;t it?
<b>Meanwhile it&#39;s the SASTA Keeping Up With Kardashian</b>
Wannabe Kardashians who are itself wannabes
4 flop wives of 4 supremely flop actors 😂😂😂
I actually really liked the show because srk, his wife guari, Karan, Jacqueline,.. and many more amazing bollywood actors/actress were in the show
You notice how India is mostly a country of dark skinned Indians. but these people are mostly white.
Can someone tell me who the hell are they? <br>(Edited) <br>Ok I commented before I see Srk.. Got that one of them is Gauri khan.. But still the others? <br>Who are they?
I literally like Maheep Kapoor. She is so young and beautiful 😍
They wanna be Americans so bad. It’s embarrasing. Lol.
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOW. CAN&#39;T WAIT FOR SEASON 2😭😭😭😭😭
What song is this ?
are they really this famous in Bollywood? 🤔 I was a huge fan of Bollywood as a child but I don&#39;t know them at all! ... never saw them in a film only their relatives hahaha 🤷‍♀️... I thought I could see someone like Kajol, Rani etc... I&#39;m a little disappointed...
Cut the crap..you mean the wives of the most flop bollywood actors? Think about it..these poor flop husbands why are they   listed as flops in the first place..some of them I didnt even know till now I mean just now. And there is a show which shows us the lives of their wives..really!!!
Nice
This show should be called Rich Bitches and thier twitches😎😎😎🔥❤️🎉
Kardashian jesa show he
Hello bollywood Aunties😂😂
This was such a vapid show full of vapid people. And those ladies, seriously money can&#39;t buy taste, the outfits were horrendous. India stop following America and stop making same sh!t  t.v as them!!
Such wanabe aunties !!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=102">1:42</a> Dat grand walk by srk🔥🔥🔥❤
In this entire series the best people were their husbands, gauri khan and SRK.. even Kardashians doesnt show off soo much... there is a huge difference between Indians and foreigners.. kardashians have remained all natural in their lifes compared to bollywood wives.. kardashians are billionaires still have perticular priorities.. they have discussed about every ups and downs in their life.. there is a reason behind why people love kardashians  and why these bollywood wives are been trolled.. not like they are worst but Indian audience expect something natural than them showing off much about their parties and hangouts...
This show is supposed to show just show off or what?
I am so confused why did Seema khan and Sohail khan live in a separate house since they are both married 🤔
when money and fame is given to stupid people. This happens....
Thought I was going to experience some Indian culture this was just Indian ladies trying to act western
I just know 1 aunty from this series.. who are the other ones?
Give me a break 🙄🙄🙄 . This idea of the show is copied from the American tv shows( the fabulous wives of new New Jersey/atlanta etc etc ).
I wested my 5minutes watching this type of sheet<br>On Netflix 🤮🤮
Bollywood celebs wives nhi criminals ki wive h jane kitne outsider ko mar k yaha tak pohoche honge
I love this show! ( I think I’m the only fan here, I can see by all the negative comments)😜
netflix is the new  Bollywood of India.
greetings from australia. this show is BETTER than all the reality shows i&#39;ve seen so far.  the ONLY negative thing is she mentioned those horrors kardashians
I think the show&#39;s name should be &quot;stupid lives of trying too hard to be kardashians&quot;
The potential stalker be like 👁👄👁
Who are these 35k people who liked this video
Great
Stupid aunties who don&#39;t have anything to do😂<br>Well to mention that every film kapoor&#39;s husband appeared or was a part of flopped but there are some exceptions like kal ho na ho 😂😂😂<br>And the pandey one her husband is mostly known for his role of aakhri pasta in the housefull franchise.<br>Don&#39;t know about the rest.<br>I didn&#39;t see this series yet but from the trailer i hated it<br>And not to forget they are sending a message to the directors of bollywood that says: please give our husbands and children a role in your movies😆<br>And how could they do that?<br>Through kharab johar😄
0 percent in the entire world have covid  yet all governments want the ENTIRE world vaccinated despite the dangers of this vaccine
Bakwas
Wow! The comments section is a cesspool of hate. Why bother watching if you can&#39;t stand them? I LOVE them all and more power to them for living life on their own terms. The show was fun, light entertainment to unwind to. If you are looking for classy/intellectually stimulating content, go watch a Satyajit Ray movie instead of shaming these ladies for their life choices.
what is this track though in the end ?
Raise your hand how many watching this 💩  comment rise ✋ or 😂
Nice
arent they like too old. Ad most Indian women I see arent that light skinned unless they are misplaced arabs or mixed with Whites
bal wara....
People are hating but I thoroughly enjoyed the show. I might have hated it if I was indian myself but coming from outside I just loved their different personalities and the chemistry between them. Maheeps mouth made me lol throughout 😄
I can&#39;t compute the fact that these women and their family are  living such a lifestyle while millions of others live in extreme poverty, are raped and do not have access to education in the same country.  Oh and it&#39;s not charity or small organisations that will change a thing . It&#39;s a major revolution that this country needs.
Sasta Keeping up with kardashians X 100
&quot;REALLY?!&quot;<br>- Indian People, 2021
Ye kvi hindi me nai bat krte kya
Bollywood is trash
Stupid , they are nowhere without their husbands fame and money
I have the full movie at my channel<br>🥰👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
Drinking champagne, having a fleet of people doing your hair and makeup, shopping in luxury cars is a life &quot;mundane?&quot; Damn. Really.... ?
Cheap version of kuwtk
Kafi bakwas cheap version of the real  housewives if beverly hils
Understood that money can&#39;t buy mind
Eww
Yuck!🤮
Neposhit
Who came here after ujjwal trivedi&#39;s video ?
Idk why people are throwing so much hate this was amazing!!
Ananya is full meam material
Why do I find this to be a blatant rip off of the famous movie Sex and the City...<br><br>Eventhough I haven&#39;t seen it but still
So what is it they want to show to people.
We definitely want S2 as soon as possible because it feel soon different after watching this want to feel again
I don’t care what others think but for me the best part about this series was Seema Khan. She was so  unapologetic n funny. Her conversations with her son were very natural  unlike other ladies <br>She did not mince any words and mood say what she feels. I would love to watch season 2 for her
If cringe content is not cringe, then what&#39;s the whole point. Everyone complaining that is bad, I think that was the whole objective. To create something so bad that it&#39;s good.
Keeping up with the Kardashians lite😂😂😂
Here cuz of Farina and Dongin 🤣🤣🤣
Bhavna is classy. I like her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=79">1:19</a> exactly what it is.
क्या ये लोग हिंदी में बात नही करते ????
The grown up version of &quot;Four more shots !!&quot; series
You watch... they earn! <br>STOP WATCHING SHITTY PEOPLE DO SHITTY STUFF AND EARN!
Its like sasta sex and the city....
Gatiya auratein
when the comment section is better than the show ........
Aah!! Found at least one comment section with no spammers and actually the comments are worth a watch than this stupid trailer
I thought that the kids are stupid but now i realise that the whole system is stupid😂😂😂
98% people don&#39;t know who they are...and nobody are interested
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Kon dekhta h yr yeh sb 🤦🏼‍♀️
Who said they are rich I mean really ...if anyone says gauri then I can think that but I mean these women
Why they can&#39;t help poor people if they have so much money
ye kya bawasir banaya
Bhakwas
Now European ladies  will say how these four Indian ladies are smitten by our  European culture and trying to look like us.
🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮
they should speak hindi
disgusting and cheap imitation of  western shows, lmao this is embarrassing
Kaha se pakad laye ho in angrajo ki biwio ko
Seema is sweet among all and Nilam has her time  with govinda movies !
DEAR NETFLIX, ACCEPT IT OR NOT, BUT THIS IS CALLED <b>TRASH</b>
Why so much negativity? 🤦🏻‍♀️They&#39;re just having a laugh and living their lives, give them a break. Everything in life isn&#39;t serious, ffs it&#39;s corona times - chill a little. 😂<br>It&#39;s not about their husbands, this is about the women. They have their own professions even and are independent.
CHEAP VERSION OF <br>The real housewives of beverly hills.
Unpopular , Useless gold diggers of  India 😂
I cant even stand for 10mins to watch this...
Netflix India is downgrading day by day
Oh my god so nostalgic aunties!! # bloody lives of Bollywood wives and yaa now going to launch Shanaya and jahaan in Bollywood... Oh my god mujhe in par Taras aa rha h..help these people....
My eyes will bleed
Why people are hating this show? To be honest I am really loving this show🥰 can&#39;t wait for another part 😃
💖Hollywood💖 is better than tattoo 💩Bollywood
Can’t believe I watched this program, these ladies do not have any class, common sense nor manners between them. Real let down for India 🇮🇳 to be producing trash like this, 💜from London.
It was entertaining and amazingly glamorised, which was the purpose I suppose. Maheep and Bhavna were fun to watch as two contrasting characters! Great job done
It should definitely be titled as - Desperate housewives of Bollywood’s bootlickers.
who else felt peace when she finally spoke hindi
Title should have been bollywood wives of flop actors ..
Ya kya bawasir hai🙄
why is this looking like sasta version of keeping up with the kardashians
Jinke husband kuch nahi karte un log utne aamir ha , to unka kya hoga jinke husband work karete ha 😂😂😂😂
RANDOM THOUGHT:<br>Does anybody else think Seema Khan and Kiara Advani look slightly alike? <br>No? Just me? 👀😂
Indian content on Netflix is the worst....please dont make garbage like this....better to watch Thai or Korean
👍
That&#39;s like four spoilt walking Insta handles🙄
Ok but what&#39;s the background song?
Nothing impresses me about them just show off totally.
What the hell was that?
The scary part - They procreate 🙄
Can anbody tell me in ep 1 there is at the middle of the drama song called you dont have to be perfect for everything to be right i love that song but i couldnot find it please tell me a singer name??
Dear Netflix, do you really think we audience are that jobless? <br><br>Cringe maximum.
Her juhu neighborhood looks like a slum, infact entire Mumbai looks like a slum. I heard so much about Bandra, when I saw it, it was full of garbage. Even poor countries like Thailand are cleaner than India. Thanks to corrupt the shiv sena, whole of Mumbai is a pile of garbage. Ghati raj mein aisa hi hoga.
Rich people with poor mentality. <br>Seema Khan DMs the kardashians like they are her cousins. <br>Maheep Kapoor has voyeuristic tendencies. <br>Neelam is desperate for a job.
Oh my god! Please tell me this is scripted or I&#39;ll lose my mind
To make 2020 even worse kjo thanks for introducing this 🙂 ur movies will make are nerves bursted thats why we don&#39;t watch ur movies 😉
Ye saale nhi sudharenge kya bawaasir bna ke rakh di ha??
Bhawna pandey looks beautiful
by watching this trailer i think netflix should ban in india
Desperate classless housewives of Bollywood
This show is so stupid I watched the first episode they are just doing the most and they are trying to be something they are not and they are obsessed with the kardashain just old hoes trying to be young and cool it’s a joke 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢
This is just soo stupid !!
They have misconception that people care abt how they spend their lives
Maybe I should stick to dating dusky girls 😂😂😂
Antisocial aunties. So much money still u look so sh**.....
Irony is all of their husbands have no work left in bollywood.. Failure Families..
Can’t blame star kids for acting stupid when they are raised by parents like these 🤷🏽‍♀️
So true! Imagine the pressure they must be going through, with aunties like these constantly asking them or nagging them! Can’t blame Ananya Pandey for her struggles
ohh my god,, ur have only moeny .... like a b****.. Your Husbands a soo failure man, that they have no Option to make moeny with her Wives... Shamefull
Aunties acting as they are girls....<br>That guy is staring us <br>.following  us...oh really....budhiya
Pooja what is this behaviour
Trash !
I saw the whole show, it was entertaining.  Iiked it.
Dear Netflix... do come up with more quality works like super deluxe and pava kadhaigal. They will make you look classy and will give you an international standard. Or better yet try Asuran , soorarai potru and jallikattu which have been nominated for the golden globes 2021. Better yet jallikattu have been nominated for oscars. We’re talking about quality here
Angerzi kidaa apni bund mai daloo.... 👎👎....salaa gatar show
30k likes and 30k dislikes.. this is awesome 😂.. let&#39;s see who wins , likers or dislikers<br>Today&#39;s date when it was equal -dec 24 2020
Their existence is the most pointless thing in the universe
How cheap it is to say that young girls are under their parents umbrella and their kids are working under the sun..every young girl will work if she gets a job as easy as these kids get...we are studying so hard to get into a good college,get good score..and the biggest irony is that these people without any proper education are &quot;earning&quot; at this age..
They still sound like typical Indian aunts in an elite setup.
I&#39;ve noticed that they keep just going to Qatar ;-;
They all look gold digger without class
I’m not Indian but I don’t mean to offend when I say that I notice everyone in the cast is light skinned and there seems to be no darker skinned ladies apart from staff...
Ananya pandey —overacting ki dukan.
What Raj Kapoor built with so hard work and they have turned this into a trash dump.
I like it new trend is coming best luck go ahed
They make it soo easy for us to hate them
Bitches
The way Maheep says, &quot;A lot of girls out there are still under mom and dad&#39;s umbrella&quot;, as if their daughters have struggled a LOT to be an actor.👏🏻
I think they are more western than the west😂
Neelam is the only attractive one out of all of them
Why so much of hatred? What did they do to u? Don’t watch if u don like, why insulting them personally and after all that u guys are talking about culture. Get a life guys
They are copying kuwtk , earning money without doing anything
And it’s unfair to put neelam in the same Category as those other ladies, because neelam is not just a Bollywood wife, she was a Bollywood star her self! She stil is more famous  than her husband!
Their accents?? Wow talk about western ‘wannabe’s.’<br><br>Also I’m sorry I have to say this but we don’t say ‘yaaa’ after every sentence. That doesn’t make you sound like you’re from England or USA. Just makes you sound desperate. 😑
I didn&#39;t find this all bad. If you watch this you&#39;ll know. It&#39;s a lot different from KUWTK. These women don&#39;t wear skimpy clothes and sleep with men. They have husbands and have much decent lives than the Kardashians
maintain the likes and dislikes ratio to 1:1
Ohh god even I can&#39;t watch full trailer how people survived in this series 😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=78">1:18</a> what song is this?
netflix sarcasmly named it as ‘fabulous life’ while laughing in corner
Let the Bollywood wives live the way they want to... <br>They are just trying to be like another Veere Di Wedding which we hate... <br>Over Glamour and unnecessary controversial expressions. Who wants to watch🙄❓
Netflix mereko paisa chaiye is video ko  recommende karne keliye, jaldi de re baba.
It&#39;s like dilli darling
kya ctyapa hai ye
I don&#39;t like 👎
Poor Anaya , struggle saaf dikhra hai
To sum up the series in one line....<br><br>Jaha humare sapne pure hote hai waha inka struggle shuru hota hai😂😂
30 k out of 30k 😂😂😂💯
Maheep kapoor is the cheapest  woman...not decent at all...bas muh se galiyan nikalti hai..
What nonsense is this ? Netflix is filled with such craps
lol dese ladies faking foreign accents 2 luk kool...so cringe😆😆😅🤣👎👎
If u were on the fence abt bollywood, watching half an episode is going to make u realize that bollywood is a dumbminded, obscenity mouthing, completely classless self indulgent, self absorbed, arrogant, seemingly elitist, selfish bloody nincompoopy industry.  Awful god awful show. Yucky 🤮
umm sorry, guys I don&#39;t know why I clicked this ........... I think Netflix contents are getting out of my sense<br> so I might unsubscribe
This show proves very well that you cant buy class and personality with money 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
If they have money to afford that luxurious lives then why cant they afford going to school and learn how to act decent and speak like a decent person.
Trash acting, trash accents, trash personalities they all have.<br>trash language specially sanjay Kapoors wife.
yall know you will be hella entertained so shut yo bitch asses up
Lawda lassan👎
I&#39;m embarrassed of bollywood. Sorry for this terrible content. Ignore! 👍🏻
Who are they ?
Who are they I literally never saw them.... Are they from India?
Okay, so this is a b-grade take of keeping up with the Kardashians (as if KUWTK wasn&#39;t a trash enough) 😶
People: Money Can’t buy Class and Elegance...<br>Netflix India: ‘ Yes ‘, here is an example 😲
The fact that this is trending number one in netflix i-
Kiya karu randio ki life janke? Laund pe rakhte hai randioko
I observed Maheep is a lot closer to Seema. Their bond outshines in the group dynamic. Whereas Bhavana and Neelam are side kicks in this relationship dynamic.
The trailer is cringy, imagine how the series is gonna be
bakwaas
Even a series with bad script but Nawazuddin or  Pankaj Tripathi in it will get more praise than this.
This is an open testimony to the fact that  money cannot buy you ethics!
Four More Shots ... Copy 😂
Indians doing what they do best, COPY OTHERS.
who cares ?? Please, do something productive and meaningful in life.
How&#39;s the cringe?
its worst programme i ever watched ,
These mommies are proud when their kids wear expensive designer clothes and spoil all money🤮
Why India always copy Hollywood
Seriously ??
I wish people from the comments section wrote some show ideas for Netflix. They are much more creative! 😂
Very bad. Dont watch, save your life.
Faltu drame kya bakvasss giri kya avtar or maid se kaise bat karte bo bhi insan hai .<br>Bakvasss giri bolliwood bakvasss giriii kuch bhi drameee ise acha apna gaon ke log hai
Gta 6
Dumbledore watching this, &quot; Let the cringe begin&quot;
I hope or wish they would treat the help better.
This series has given me even stronger reason to hate star kids. They are so over privileged, they just decide that they want to act and any big director signs them inspite of they having zero talent. They are groomed from the beginning. Ordinary actors take years and years to look like them because of less resources. And these star kids come from nowhere and steals their roles.
And thats when u say the real level or class of tamashewaali for real...<br>Moral: stop wasting hard earn cash for their arrogance n use it for ur fundamental needs and  underprivileged instead...
you know what i would rather than watch Pakistani serials😉
Keeping up with the Kardashian Indian version 😹
😂😂😂
What the hell was that?🙄
lmao, to all the people who are complaining  &quot;they are so rich, pretentious,we can&#39;t relate&quot; i mean that&#39;s what the series is all about right ? why would anyone be interested in seeing normal middle class lifestyle on netflix?
What a load of crap .. please karan we do not live in a fairy tale world .. where star kids are ruling Bollywood.. sorry why can’t he show really life without all this toilet mouth swearing from Sanjay and wife and trying to change poor Neelam <br>Into a bad actor 🤬🤬
Nahi chahiye, Ek keeping up with the Kardashians to hai hi, ek aur tattie aaye
No money pity, have money pitiful.
यह क्या kachara hai
Now i know why the star kids are like that😂🤣🤣
Fabulous lives of dumb Bollywood wives😂😂😂
Fabulous lives of dumb Bollywood wives😂😂😂
Such a trash 🤢🤮
Bruh they are trying so hard to copy the Kardashians ong
Seriously this is so stupid
So disappointing that such grown women who are supposed to be classy, accomplished, high society and from respected families have such bad manners and crude behaviors and worse language than a public toilets’ wall. I’d rather watch village women who are working hard and much more respectable.
The worse thing is this show is trending in india, Pakistan and Bangladesh!!<br>So guys if we don&#39;t want such shows to occur thn why on the face of this Earth we are giving such content so much attention??
lmaoooooo what is this trash
Netflix India.... going down with content day by day....
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤧🤧🤧🥵🥶🥶🥶🥶
This is such trash. I mean ,so trashy. I am in.
Sasti copy of KUWTK ughh!
From where Netflix get these saste Kardashians 🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=27">0:27</a> arjun kapoor sent her a message
I condemn Bollywood
So they are trying to portray themselves like super rich white women.
Neel looks fabulous
I never knew that i could vomit in my soul until i watched this
Actually i started to like Neelam more. So elegant &amp; classy. Control over language &amp; home..such a lady.
Then he arrives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=103">1:43</a> ❤️
Paisa do to ye bikini pehen ke pocha bhi paga dengi. Sab paise ki maya h.
Netflix India is running out of content
I searched everyone&#39;s name and dint know anyone  😂 😂, and they are wives to whom ? we only know them by face and not by names as we have only seen them in some random side roles...lol
Came after shwetab gangawar
These girls will not do it better ,they&#39;ll  do worse
Life isn&#39;t fair that&#39;s what&#39;s all of this about,<br>It&#39;s not their fault that they are rich and most people if they have enough money they&#39;ll buy expensive stuff,<br>Also there&#39;s a dark side to those women life (celebrity wifes) they lost part of their marriage to stardom, I mean any normal woman will get so angry if her husband touches or kiss another woman but they have to handle it and never show jealousy because its their husband&#39;s job and she has to accept the fact that her husband is romancing another woman on set all day and just hoping he won&#39;t fall in love with another woman or do other women.<br>And some of them learned to kill this jealous voice and they accept cheating
Worst series everrrrr, there is only one thing in this series &quot;overacting&quot;
Can anyone give me a clue on who these cougars are?
One word. MILFS.
Ngl u guys watching Netflix? Really?
<b>This is supposed to be the indian version of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Atlanta ........ india stop doing everything American is doing or your also going to get messed up</b><br><br><b>I thought that India was a very very religious Country and woman can&#39;t wear outfit that shows too much but this Netflix Serie proves it wrong...... I guess I was wrong about India- india is not the way I thought</b>
Their husbands didnt make it big in bollywood and now they want to be famous.
Bhosdiwalo Hindi movies kar kar ke tumhare ghar pal rahe hai aur Hindi salo keval naukro ke saath bolte ho. Hindi bolne me sharm aati hai to movies me bhi kyo bolte ho haramiyo.
Ye kya bawaseer bana diye ho Netflix India.
It is sasta wala version of keeping up with the kardashians!!!
Pity them...The old identity they have is wife of some sasta actors:(((
we blame poor star kids for being dumb.....while webfail to realise they who they hav been bought up by.....
“It’s good to have money and the things that money can buy, but it’s good, too, to check up once in a while and make sure that you haven’t lost the things that money can’t buy.”George Lorimer
i feel like this is kinda a copy of ‘’ CHURAILS ‘’ &gt; pakistani series.
Me after watching this : &quot; Ek poore aadmi ka poora dimaag laga tha ye banane m?&quot;
The poison of the western world has reached India I see. Be ready for a scourge of dumb and talentless airheads to spread across India.
What are they actually trying to showcase through this ... God knows seriously 🙄🙄🙄🙄
&quot;Mundane Lifestyle&quot;??? How about a slap across all your faces. Cheap Ass Wannabe&#39;s!!!
Maheep is sooo irritating to watch🙄
Kyu saari boodhi ghodiyo ko ikkatha kr k torture kar rahey ..
Now I understand why these star kids are so dumb!
Is 2020 was a trailer 😭
Why is everyone so white? This is India right?
They seriously thought people are gonna watch this bullshit
So what I understood is these people serves no purpose in life.. and they never done something good for the people... And so is their kids
Cringe
The comments are more entertaining than the series.
they’re all foul mouthed trash.  No class, just rich.
I had more struggle than annaya Pandey had while watching this trailer😭😭😭
Why  is it in Netflix
Somebody should tell that lady (Maheeb Kapoor) that swearing at others doesn’t make you look cool. Every time she opens her mouth she swears for no reason. disgusting!
This show is illustration of  money can’t buy class. Everyone in this show is painful to watch them.
Ab yeh log aa gayi ab inko bhi apna marwana hai . 😆😆😆
Inse achi aur sachi toh seema aunty from mumbai thi, now I regret hating her 😐
Lauda choda
It&#39;s a Jersey Thing
Cringe into hundred
kept gauri khan in center... shows how unimp these women are....lolz
Milf
Ok so this is Indian version of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills 👀
India is So not ready for these kind of shows
Poora show English main, kaun dekhega ise
This show should be called &quot;Indians trying to be American so hard very hard desperately hard&quot;
Make biopic on soldiers wife
Now Netflix is degrading their content!
Maheep uses 3 rate language typical cheap woman
For those who defend capitalism, watch this. The system was built this way
Kardashians lite
Oh god they’re trying so hard to copy Hollywood shows 🤣 clowns
I like the part when srk comes....he is love
I am not paying Netflix after this ...
Because of shows like this we are loosing our faith in Netflix. Dear Netflix we believe you can do better.
Omg for a second I didn’t know that was Neelam
Hi Netflix stop wasting money on Bollywood content...we are boycotting Bollywood
ये क्या हग दिये netflix तूने
I don&#39;t want my kids to become like them, so I will try my best not to  watch and let my kids watch Bollywood movies. Bollywood has been corrupted by kids of such women.
Oh god really? Really indian television? You want to go the american route with the ridiculous reality tv trash? So dissapointed!
Ridiculously cringy
Can anyone tell me is this show a scripted one or real one?
Lost some braincells
What do they think of themselves,Kardashians are so much more rich but they are humble
Oppss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=1">0:01</a> what she wants dog.. call  PeTA
Thak gaya hoon like krte krte &quot;comments&quot;
lite version of &#39;keeping up with the kardashian&#39;
more money then sense is what these ladies are 🙄 i would  rather watch Kardashians those  frekin women build empires  on their own atleast.
Trashy fashion ,trashy lives   ,
Bro wth is this 😭😭
Idiots
So it&#39;s a mix of sex and the city movie, keeping Up with the Kardashians and The Housewives of Beverly Hills.
Sharuh khan wife!!!!!!😳 thank good kajol is not one of them
In one of the episodes, Arjun asked Jahan Kapoor, Have u started learning Hindi? I&#39;m like whtttttt they don&#39;t know Hindi. That&#39;s weird. Why can&#39;t they speak their mother tongue?  I found only  Bhavana Pandey  most natural and sensible one.
Does anyone know what song is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=91">1:31</a>
Which song is this can anyone tell <br>&quot;I don&#39;t care what you say i don&#39;t care how you feel you just don&#39;t wear the crown&quot;
When you realise India is the same country where gems are made like scam 1992 and same way these garbages are made
👎👎👎
Netflix is a newly dumping ground for all Indian directors and film makers. Sorry but you&#39;re giving worst contents. Actually they aren&#39;t even contents.
Nonsence
Is mandeep really 15 when she married and husband was 32 they say before marriage she n her husband had 6-7 years of courtship.... I mean according to this she started dating 8-9 yrs and her husband was 25 years of age.... Someone tell her please learn maths n then lie and on Instagram her husband post happy 27th birthday together... If she is 1982  born then what age did they started dating
They couldn’t find a dark skinned Indian to cast? Hmmm
Netflix is churning out pandemics faster than China in 2020.
That shahrukh khan walk
This is one of the million Epic Fails of &quot;Bollywood tryna be Hollywood&quot;
My favourite is Bhagwana
dumb dumb dumb🤦‍♀️💆‍♀️. Watched one episode of it..lol..can&#39;t take it anymore
Zarina ji ka ek dialogue yaad agaya<br>. <br>. <br>. <br>. <br>. <br>. <br>. <br>Cheeeee
People are dying out of hunger due to pendamic and these shamess creatures fluent their wealth and want us to believe that their life is still so difficult
People are shameless if you watch this

एक अच्छी सी गाली देलो अपने आपको - From All Indians
@Netflix do you really think indians are interested in watching this!!!
Over acting at Oscar level...
Ohh this cringed me so much!
Sasta version of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills 🤣🤣🤣
Here for reading comments only..
I came here to read comments.
Bhai sahab these comments are more fabulous than the show 😂😂
like for season 2
i see full show the best part is srk entry&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;🤙🔥🔥
They are ridiculous... 🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤮🤮
Good to see that people are disliking this bullshit garbage in huge number. Sach mein Desh bdl rha hain.
Laude k bal randi khana hai bollywood
And that marks the end of the Toxic 2020..
Yeh kya bawasir bana diye ho
Ye kya Bawasir bana diya hai.<br>came here after watching the takedown by old famous honest review
Kaun hain yeh log .. kahan se aate hain
After watching this it just made me feeel sooo small!!
Cringe af-
Woh Toh Theek Hai, Par ye hein Kon??
Ya sub ke husbands ke naam kya hai koi bataiga?
Most annoying content I have ever seen 🙄....<br>It just a game and fame of money 💰
When kardishians does this...aww they are so cute<br>When bollywood wives does that ...total money show off..listen guys whoever say money can&#39;t solve your problem must not had enough money to solve them...<br>Whoever say
Ew
Kisi ke saath bhi soo jana q k paisa hai

Um mummy log bhi aisi hoti hain??????
eat the rich pls
I feel like they did this on purpose so we can only watch it to critic it.
Super Hit..The Show taught us Friends are forever.. God Bless Them All..
Is this a mokumentry or reality I cant tell but the fact there speaking in English makes me thing mokumentry
&quot;kehna kya chahte Ho&quot;
The only thing good was srk
They are in that position because of us.!  We put our hard earned money, so that they can go abroad for holidays!
Trying too hard to imitate Beverly housewives but plots are not even half juicy...
After seeing all episodes.. 1st episode I felt they were quite nervous, but still trying.. And from 2nd episode they seem quite comfortable &amp; I never knew Sanjay Kapoor &amp; Sohail Khan&#39;s wife are so muhphat 😂😜.. I don&#39;t know but after seeing all the episodes.. somehow I started liking them.. Good job NETFLIX.. this reminded me of The Real Housewife&#39;s of beverely hills &amp; in fiction sex and city serial.. 👍🏼
The word mundane and a car comes through name &quot; Rolls Royce &quot;. I seriously pity the videographer.
I hope is not a second season of this joke show.. please
I pity these ppl.....thank God we don&#39;t belong Bollywood........<br>Pooor Richie&#39;s.....No wonder their life is so shallow.....
NETFLIX! kindly delete this unwanted peice of crap. not a joke
Who are they 🙄???
You guys done with good content ?! Or just going with the stereotype of Indian movies?!  <br>Come on Netflix! You were expected to give better content for that bucks.
Copy of real wives of beverly hills and keep up with kardashians. Originality kidhar gayi?!
It felt like a parody video
Shame shame shame... you are Indian and you can&#39;t speak Hindi...<br>Always big quotes in Hindi movies about Indian who are abroard always hold on to their culture..<br> I am from South America.<br>The Indian community there speak better Hindi than you bollywood people.
Bakwaaas concept..... No one cares...
khule me jo hgega oo apna guu khayega
Netflix is wasted the time 😞😞😞
Pathetic...seanceless
Wives of actors who didn&#39;t make it
lol hahahahahahahahahahaha
language was vulgur sometime.i stop watching
What is the name of the song and artist in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=91">1:31</a> PLEASE??? It was also played in the Indian Matchmaker on Netflix, but I can&#39;t find it anywhere :((((
Totally cringe worthy😠
Let&#39;s copy the Kardashians
Gaoti version of keeping up with Kardashians
Not just trying to be Kardashians, but also trying to speak like them is the &quot;STRUGGLE &quot; Ananya was speaking about😂😂😂😂
No one give a damn abt ur Lives.
The comments are more entertaining than the four bimbos
I am here after Tamil stand-up comedian Mervynn rozz&#39;s new video 😂 now I can relate a lot bro!!!!!!
They are copying kardashians
What song is this?
Kuch bhi😂😂
Learn something from BLACKPINKS Light up they sky they motivate us and What is this yaar &quot;SASTE Kardashian&quot;😂
Bastrads😡😡😡😡
Nita Ambani probably laughing her ass off !!!
Is this Sarcastic or Stupid??
This trailer makes me to puke
Please don’t compare this with Desperate Housewives. That was my favorite show ever. Those women had a crazy, fun and emotional side to it. Not sure what to say about these women yet. <br>They kinda ruined my whole  Bollywood celeb vibe for me.<br>I hope Ashwariya Rai, Gauri Khan and Madhuri Dixit and Deepika don’t act like that.
Atleast Kardashian were a lot younger when they started that but these are 50+ years old hags, at least act a little classy
There is a fine line between being rich and being classy.
The Wanna be Kardashians of Bollywood.
I came across this show just today on Netflix and wanted to read the most authentic comments on this. No better place than YouTube. You all made my day. <br>Real people real thoughts. You guys keep going.
They have included ananya pandey<br>In this series,<br>Now they can blame her<br>At the end<br>About the whole messup😂
The fakest thing I have ever seen...literally it’s a cross between keeping up with the kardashians and the housewives of Beverly Hills 👎🏼
Sasti copy of keeping up with the kardashion and the real housewifes of Beverly hills
All they use is cuss words! They are they all are friends for 20+ years.. they b!/(# abt each other.. it so evident they are not at all best buddies and haven&#39;t seen each other&#39;s work 🤦.. common people have better bond and culture
ee ka bawasir bana diye ho
Wanna be sex and the city
Extended version of 4 more shots please🍷🍾
Copy of keeping up with karadashian
The worst show of the year.
💩💩💩ekdam bakwas show
Agli bar show banao ,Everyone is a bollywood star unless Ambanis need waiters<br>for their kids wedding.
Guy&#39;s I just watched this an I say it&#39;s actually a good show believe me
No wonder Shanaya Kapoor and Ananya Panday are such vacuous bimbettes. The apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree.
So is it comment section or some meme page.
Trash and cringe. Saw one clip my family was watching. I just left the room instantly.
Got some popcorn to read the comments. Came here just to enjoy the comments! 🤭😂🤣👏
Its bascially called betherly Hills
Fabulous lives of bollywood aunties
This one is one of the most stupid show i have ever seen. <br>After this I stopped paying to Netflix
Netflix, you stink! Unsubscribed way back. Glad, so glad!
This is where our money goes when we watch sh*tty bollywood films. These donkeys have gotten filthy rich.
Miserable vulnarable cheap life of flop bollywood actor
I have watched the whole season and i must say that bhavna is the cutest and sensible one and seema the nerd one. I loved both the ladies 😍
Mujhe to isme kuch fab nai laga bakwas ek dam
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse ,their made up american accents or they themselves !
Netflix has lower their standard after releasing such useless content.
Netflix, why would you go ahead and produce this crap? You had such a great run so far. I valued you for your content and you go ahead and do this?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Netflix raise your standards pls !!!
Except for Neelam Kothari who are these people ?
what i was kept saying while watching trailer...F**k...
Aunties do it better 😂😂
More like Cringe lives of Cringe Wives.
“How cringe do you want this series to be?”<br>Netflix India- “Yes”
Never watched anything so pretentious. How do they get all the money from, all flop actors wives. <br>Could not even keep up with the first episode. <br>Pathetic. Stop bringing such pathetic shows Netflix.
<b>Keeping up with the kardashians LITE</b>
Ye kya chod faila diya hai?
Just when I thought 2020 couldn&#39;t get worse..
Bokchoda koi freeee 5 6 dec
Really!!! Who wants to  watch these aunties.. This looks like desi &quot;Desperate wives&quot; 🥴
Hum India walo ko desi  Tadka pasand hai
Why are you ruining out country status on these Bullshit people? Please focus topic on Education, climate change, poverty. i will glad to pay your monthly subscription if you are get serious.
Utterly nonsense ....<br>These wives r not even independent just enjoying on their husband&#39;s salary... N then they say this is class..
yeh video dekhke mujhe aisa lag raha hai ki <br>humari desh mein nakre karne wali logo ki kami nahi paregi
I 👏 am 👏 stressed
Audience to Netflix : Bsdk🖕🖕🖕🖕
1 : 42 i thought asim is there
The pretentious, walmart version of Real housewives of beverly hills
Omg what is this Karen johar hit rock  bottom  India be ashamed of this rubbish
Never heard and seen any of these older women.
Just a bunch woman wearing aviator glasses
Omggg that woman trying to speak French at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=86">1:26</a> :/
I don&#39;t understand I m watching keeping up with the Kardashians or sex and the city and where is the original series???where is the cast ??
Who else regret watching this -<i>___</i>-
This show is basically for Netflix 199 plan users desi and cheap.
&quot;Daily shop &quot;ultra  max pro😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣
theres nothing Indian about them...n those accents cringy affffff
One question. Who are they?
Sasta sex in the city and keeping up with the kardashians
Such idiots. No wonder money can&#39;t buy some goddamn brains. Copying a show that too ruining it lol
Loved it!!! Very nice show
Kya chutiyayapa hai be bahenchod
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=94">1:34</a> her struggle 😂
I think only bollywood flop actor&#39;s I mine there  husband&#39;s will watch there flop show lol...we the public has no interest in your stupid bollywood wives show
Their husbands are not famous they are just wives who like to live glamarous lifestyle. However, I got to know Ananya&#39;s mother. She is cool and well spoken, so opposite of annoying Ananya.
𝘽𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙮𝙬𝙤𝙤𝙙 ?<br> 𝙁𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙬𝙞𝙫𝙚𝙨
Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Indian version.
Why is this in English? I thought it’s Bollywood wives.
Well done! We can now produce top quality cringe content. Congratulations 🎉
Thanks America for bringing another disease to India😒
Haan ye amir logo ko paiso ke alawa kuch dikhta hai ki nahi saala yaha hum middle class log apni ghis ke thak har ke ghar aate hai Netflix kholte hai aur samne ye dikhta hai😭🤬🤦
So they bought like a or what or there are actually people that dumb to like this video or can endure this cringe and trash 🗑
Eww India is always a copy cat version of America.
Abey yeh kya bakwas hai??😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chugli aunties(gossip gang ) . Rich who kind of has problem with everything
They think they own this industry n it’s just a new way of launching their kids without talent
Modiji u need to regulate this . So much of unemployment in India
How old are these women? It like I am seeing a fair and lovely advert. I am not from India but it would be refreshing to see something that portrays the diversity of skin shades of women in India. Netflix you missed a mark here.
This happens when you literally run out of content 😂🤷
Just Srk Matters❤
Ameero ke chochle
Netflix in other countries: Stranger things, The  Queen&#39;s Gambit, Dark, OITNB, Ozark, Mindhunter and so on<br><br>Netflix India: Indian Matchmaking, The fabulous lives of Bollywood wives!<br>😂
Su Suuu
I&#39;m glad,I don&#39;t know any of them
The only realistic line I heard them saying in this entire video &quot;we are actually ridiculous&quot;
I genuinely loved this.. This show made me realize.. You should never go with the imdb ratings.. Much better than the expectations.. Specially the last episode.. When he arrives.. SRK is 👌😍
Half of them are not even rich - Maheep Kapoor and Neelam Kothari. One of the remaining half is the wife of a flop actor who lives off his brother. There&#39;s NOTHING fabulous about them.
Why people will watch these crap ..over acting ki dukaan..
Jesus christ! This is so pathetic. I can&#39;t believe Netflix decided to come out with a show like this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=113">1:53</a> Shahbaz nadeem
Bullshit!
I am only here for the memes and the dislikes
None of them have net worth more than 50+ million if Netflix literally wanted to make a show on rich ppl of India  try making a show on self empowered billionaire ladies from India .
when i watched it the whole time i couldnt get over all de cringe, four average looking women. Everything was so staged and sad. instead of wasting ur money on crap stuff like this use if to make good movies.
Aise show ka koi match nahi dice media ka mini web series ka saamna😌😌
This may be bollywood &#39;s new strategy to earn money ,fame and popularity once again and fool the common people by using the negative image in public eyes.<br>They r planning to benefit from the views,even if they r from haters.
Our entertainer&#39;s wifes on the hard earned entertainment money by their husband entertaining us trying to entertain us with their fabulous lifestyle show🙏.
It&#39;s time to unsubscribe Netflix.
Overrated people.👎👎👎👎
Lol
New gutter show by gutter people
Who else came here from Captain Nick&#39;s instagram?
Netflix, we don&#39;t want to watch shows on the &quot;mundane&quot; lives of bollywood wives. &quot;oh my goddd he&#39;s stalking me!&quot;<br>Omg I&#39;m unsubscribing.
Waste of time
Okk..did we need this?<br>I don&#39;t think so.
U should show whom wives are they. i had to google all four names
I disliked. 👎
Why do I get the feeling it&#39;s the movie sex and the city 2.. Kuch toh original karo bhai..
Whose wives are they?
The only good thing about this was SRK&#39;s entry.
Perfect show for WANNABEES...
Netflix is total Devil.<br>Only idea i can get with it&#39;s recent shows and now this is that lure people with elitenes n high life of celebs whom they criticize or Hate.<br>Just like Western Audience is fed that kardashians shows with no Morales, No stories just Sex,Money n Girls.
Why did they even make this series? To show us how hollow they are? No wonder Gauri Khan or Suzanne didnt star in these.. the 4 here desperately need some camera time, so while they know people will mock- they agreed to show their wierd life to us.. LOL !!!!!
Why are they even making such things? We are just least interested to know about their &quot;fabolous&quot; lives 😑😑
4 sasti milf
Just what we need during this pandemic. Shoving obscene wealth to our faces. Especially india where poverty is everywhere. I dont know how these ppl sleeps at night. Disgusting
I love this.... If we can learn to like the Kardashians.... We can learn to love these peeps. ❤️❤️ Also it&#39;s fun to watch. Like and escape from reality!! Let the haters be haters.
Just sad.... seeing such moms... just...
And REMEMBER SEEMA KHAN&#39;S SON IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE RAPE OF DISHA SALIAN AND JUST LOOK AT HER HOW CHILLED SHE IS. NOT EVEN BOTHERED THAT HER SON IS INVOLVED IN RAPING AND LATER KILLING SOMEONE.  BOLLYWOOD IS FULL OF COLD BLOODED MURDERERS.
Isme seema aunty from Mumbai ko bhi dal dete. Same acting woh bhi kar leti hai 🐒
Kya taklif hai in Aunties ko Bhai, Kya talklif hai??😠😠😠
Netflix, didn&#39;t expect this বাল from you😑
After watching this video, I suddenly have so much sympathy for Ananya Pandey, grew up among aunties like these at least she can touch her nose by tongue.<br>Also at least she is famous by her own struggles because I don&#39;t even know their husbands let alone these wives 😂
Well the comment section proves Indians haven&#39;t been brain washed by Shity Bollywood yet. <br>Thats the hope for better future
If Maheep is so stalker...She should be knowing what happend to Disha Salian in Juhu. These wives are just setting up the platform for their kids....Such a failed approachhhhhh
Concept is nice. But they could have done better. This looks whatever too...pretend
Beek gai hai Gormint.<br>Abhi toh Netflix bhi beek gaya
We all came here for the comments, didn&#39;t we?
That stalker&#39;s acting level💯🔥
They should rename this show to One Night Stand. SlamBamF#$kYouMaam. Watch it once, get your mind f$%@3d, and forget about it.
Tbh at least the real housewives of New York actually have successful careers that the women actually worked for and had no help from anyone  like Bethney Frenkel
I lost so many brain cells watching this shitty show I mean c’mon this is like the cheaper version of the Kardashians except with older women 😒
I tried watching the show twice  but they are all yelling and talking at once I can&#39;t even follow anything or watch.
It should be called Shallow Minds of Bollywood Wives
Trash show
Bhadbies of bollywood
Yes we get it, its a tough life for you 😂
A samosa has more talent than these awful wives combined
Dont waste ur time watching this stupid show we have more good series to watch 😂
This must go flop not only this all movie from nep kids should flop
While these women are out where are their children????
Omg mahdeep has such a foul mouth. Her mama needs to wash her mouth with soup. She not anything like a lady. Sanjay ne kis mard se shaadi karli
Title of the show must be changed and it should actually be...<br><br>Filthy lives of bollywood wives....<br>Get over showing off...!<br>Have some peaceful life...!<br>Feeling sad for them...
Lmaooo how sanjays wife says she cant take people talking about her kids in episode 2  omg u silly women.  U putting ur daughter in the public eye people will have their own opinion.  Face it and come on your daughter not exactly the word pretty. Shes ok Normal looking girl .. nothing special nothing anyone would look back twice at to look again. Sanjay to good and bubbly for this women..... wanna bes
Why to show this cunts in camera when you have far better issue to show
Wrong timing to release this show and trailer. When almost the entire world is hating Bollywood and fanhood is at its abyss, who is their right mind would think of launching this ? Or is it to just divert all the criticism to this show and distract from main issues of hawala, child trafficking and drug mafia. K Jo kind of proved his involvement in the dark side by releasing this now
Bruh, Just a remake of &quot;Keeping up with the Kardashians&quot; 😑😑
Don’t know how to react to watch this type of bullshit.... bhai dikhna kya chah rahe ho
Who are these people who have actually liked the trailer?
Sorry to say this is disgusting... are u r copying keeping up with kardashians?????
In this whole web series they were calling  &quot; assholes &quot; to each other yes which is actually true they are typical fuckin assholes except neelam
Watched the show only halfway. But it made me guilty to continue watching this after reading d short story ‘biriyani’ today.<br>No hate to the cast or show, but it’s just the disparity in the society that I came to realise after reading that story n then watching this show.
Well they need a source of income no?<br><br><br><br>If they&#39;re husband are flop<br><br>They need this faltu show to get money from Netflix lol<br><br><br>And Kim k probably doesn&#39;t even know she exist lol
Kardashians be like- WAiT wHAt?<br>WhAt IN ThE fUCks NaMe<br><br>I thought no reality show can be more cringey than kuwtk..<br>Lol
And I thought keeping up the the Kardashians was cringy lmao
Alt Balaji has better shows than this. Lol😂😐
Is there a mode of transportation apart from Rolls Royce<br><br>Ek baari Struggle karke toh dekho paaun zameen par aa jaenge
Horrible.
Kardashian don&#39;t bring in india people in their daily lifes
Why bring in the Kardashian,,india need to stay in their lane over that side ,,india is a whole mess clean up the slum instead of bring in the Kardashian
Netflix r u going mad?
Who are those 28 k people that liked this?
Ananya Pandey has to go through a lot of struggle because of hardships from Bhavna Pandey
All of this is staged. It is quite obvious.
It would have been nice if they released it post-pandemic. I mean there are 1 billion people struggling to make a living during this time and here we have fabulously rich people bragging about their enormous wealth.. what times do we live in?? And the dialogues are so cringey..couldn&#39;t stand 10s of watching it.
Wow the major kiss ass they did to srk and gauri.  If gauri wasn’t married to srk these ladies give a crap about her..
Title should be &quot;Corona&quot;<br>😑😑😑
Garbage ... Whats wrong with Netflix ... After Tiktok N Bigg Boss n alt Balaji its just the cringe n crap 💩...
Lol haha. Didn&#39;t really know who they are.
These women praise their children so much, I feel weird about this!! I am here doing my 1000% yet my parents throw only one sentence at me &quot; You are useless, it is not enough&quot;. I could not connect to this show at any level.
fck.bollywooooooodddd fck.bollywooodddddddddd fck bollywoooddddddddddddddddddddd fckkkkkkk bollywodddd
Oh my God, what did I just watch!!!!!!!!!
After reading each of the comments!!! 😂 thank god I’m not the only one hating this... we win guys!!!
A true realization <br>Lets not give a damn about such shows and Indian cinema would be forced to make sensible shows.
For this 800/month ??? <b>slow claps</b>
This is like keeping up with the kardashians but Indian version
Its looks so fuckin pompous....n gimmicky
If their husband gives them divorce ...I won’t be shocked...especially maheep
Hindi film industry mai kam karte hai.....magar hindi bolne mai sharam  aati hai.... learn something from south film industry... respect hindi language.... respect regional language.... talking any local language does not damage your image
I cant even watch this 2 min Trailer its just garbage
Dilli Darlings Pro Max Ultimate Ultra
Title should have been.... <br>50 year old rich dumb bitches 😂😂
Mehdeep is the cheapest. She is so cheap, talk like a jamadarni. I don’t know what she thinks about herself. <br><br>They have only one topic to discuss ‘boyfriend and girlfriend’ .
netflix series ka to pata nahi english ka big boss zaroor lag raha hai
Scariest part of this : &quot;season 1&quot;!!! 🙄🙄😱😱😱
Bakwaas
Wow the major kiss ass they did to srk and gauri. If gauri wasn’t married to srk these ladies give a crap about her..
There is something just so cringy about neelam
I absolutely love this Show ❤🔥
I don&#39;t know why but they all look the same
Sex and the city?
It&#39;s bad or it&#39;s good but it&#39;s my new guilty pleasure 😌😌😌
Tacky
Stupid Netflix stop this👿👿👿
That&#39;s what happens when 50 yr olds watch &quot;Charlie&#39;s Angels&quot;.<br>I wasn&#39;t interested in this sh*t just came to bash after watching Tanmay&#39;s reaction.
Totally cringe 😂😂😂........who told them  that their husbands are famous bollywood celebs...🤷🤷🤷
The cringe omfg i-
What&#39;s that kuwtk lite?<br>So cringy
None of them or their husband have successful career! Lol!
The title should be the nincompoop life of bollywood wives.
yeh log hindi mein baat hi nahi karte hai kya ?

I think they are a bunch of women having mid life crisis.
Name should have been.<br>&#39;Useless Life of Stupid Wives&quot;<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Agree with you Neha  Bad example for their children . I only love Gauri khan  in that episode that is how u should behave  composed calm .
Bollywood version of real housewives. Only shittier.😛
Ye bhi Shi h..
Why Netflix Is Releasing Such a Crap Content ?🤷
Am I the only one who liked the background music??
It looks worse than Karan Johar&#39;s pouts.
Should be called desperate house wives of druggies.
I regret even pirating it also.
I can see how much 120fps slow-motion is used just to make this trailer more fabulous. Nepo kid if you are reading this comment don&#39;t even try to understand it&#39;s better than your acting.😂😂😂
where is drugs angle in this crap series?
Ganja charass ky scene to hain nahin is trailer????<br>Aik honest actor ko kis tarah kill kar suicide banaya jata wo scene bhi nahin hai<br>Hate Bollywood we want justic for ssr
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IQ645-UUV4&amp;t=22">0:22</a> umm, okay....... 😐
so tacky
I saw one episode and I felt sick and then it is Karan Johar&#39;s show. What else can you expect. Its total waste of time even in pandemic I would not watch it.
Netflix just hit rock bottom, this is so pathetic, cringeworthy and looks utterly ridiculous.
It looks like a cheap parody of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills. No one is acting normal. It’s like these poor women have been asked to play the rich housewife and they’re not good at acting as they’re not really actors to begin with 🤷🏻‍♂️
Desperate housewives 🤣🤣🤣
Kardashian +Koffee with Karan = Fabulous life&#39;s of Bollywood wives
I watched 1st episode....they are literally making fun of hindi....seriously...acting like kardashians and not knowing hindi is not at all cool.
This is not the real India. 🙄
Maheep❤️
I swear if my relatives who are now 50 years or more would be taught some english, and handed with billions, the scene would just be the same.<br>Specially <b>i have to check my juhu neighbourhood</b> part.
This is what an Indian version of Keeping up with the Kardashians and Real housewives of Beverly hills..?? Matlb kuch bhi..🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Neelam is not a bollywood wife she is bollywood actress
Itni luxury life to Inka bhi bus ek sapna hi hoga <br>Itna to inko koi janta Tak nhi he real life me not even in reel
Over makeup. I don&#39;t want waste my precious time on these womens
I have learned my lesson, money can’t buy you perspective. I was looking forward to experiencing a good trashy TV SHOW...this didn’t even get trash right. 🤣
this is hilarious, people hate watching when they are saying they will never watch, it isn&#39;t quirky complaining about this
I’m not gonna lie I watched the whole season and I really liked it. It’s because of Neelam Kothari. I love her so much. I just don’t understand the reason why Gauri Khan didn’t want to take part in this show. And she said it too at the end that if she wasn’t Shahrukh Khan’s wife then she definitely would’ve been part of it. But I just think you are a celebrity’s wife so what made you so different. But then again neither of these celebrities wives,  their husband are not that famous.
this looks amazing!!!!
Please don&#39;t make Netflix another Bollywood period.
Can someone tell me whose wives are they?
D most fuckd up show ever watchd though just 10 min of my life..but still m regretting to waste dose precious one..netflix don screw up even more please lyk u said🖕🏽🤨
Srk 😍gonna watch it even if he is in for 1 min
I hated the loud swearing from these women on camera.. so crass and classless. They’re worse than the Kardashians.
Kon hai yeh sab ??????
Interesting series! 👌Watched it full and wanted to see more..waiting for season 2
2-3 marriages bollywood wibes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Seriously I dont know any of them...😑😑😑
Personally saying .... i dont have any misconceptions for any of you ....actually i don&#39;t even know any one of you....this is just an honest answer...😶😶😶
How can they be so RICH? Their Husbands been Unemployed for years 🙄
Abbhi yehi baki reh gaya tha 😂😂now what they are going to show in this ki Bollywood wives have lots of money and they fear ghost and spend there money and party 🥱🥱
For God sake stop making this looser stuff.
