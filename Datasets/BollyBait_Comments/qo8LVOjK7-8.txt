I love her acting 😘😘
People who believe that deepika is truly a dedicated personality and she  tries her best and devotes towards her acting levels : Like below 👇
I would only say....... Justice for SSR.
How much hard work behind the movie , Hats of Deepika padukone.
Girls should see the movie and come out from the acid attack and love you deepika padukone madam and thanks for the movie
Ye film kab aayegi tv par
Ppl will her see her receiving awards, her success no one will the notice/acknowledge the hardwork behind that success (this vid is one such eg let&#39;s say that plaster of paris that was no less than a hard fight). <br>In a country where ppl are being trolled, attacked, mocked nd boycotted for standing up for the right things she choose to be fearless. When most of the public figure&#39;s avoided paying solidarity to the JNU students , when they avoided the anti CAA protest she stood for it.....nd just think how powerful her presence is without even speaking a single word her presence just made the bakhts crazy......bold in reel life, bold in real life.....nd tanjahi just got fame becoz bhakts were on there way to mock this nation. One day everyone will understand the mistake they made by being andhbhakt&#39;s, being vocal about wrong government nd disrespecting the country are not same, anti national wo nhi hota jo government ke khilaf ho anti national wo hotey hai jo jane anjane mein desh ki barbadi ka karan baane.....jo already saarey bhakts hai (they are the actual anti-nationals).<br>Nd yes just because chhapaak was an amazing film nd deserved success it is not for Australian teli academy awards nd not films like tanjahi which got fame for the sick mentality of the bhakts always spreading communal hate.<br>Once a queen always a queen!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deepika">#deepika</a> ❤️ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23proud">#proud</a><br>Nd yes those who were saying film dekhne se hoga kya film dekhne se society mein awareness failegi jo illerate&#39;s ko samajh mein aayegi bhi nhi aur just because of chhapaak many states ran ban acid campaign!!<br>Nd everyone knows who did the actual PR work (bhakts) just wanted to spread rumours even after trying hard neither they could pull down deepika nor this film.<br>Just watched chhapaak in second day of release it was amazing got goosebumps nd without any doubt deserve the highest level of awards.<br>As vikrat said it is not easy to be a women like deepika in a country like ours. Also he did a fabulous job. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23abbadalnahai">#abbadalnahai</a>

When Meghna said an actor becomes the character that&#39;s not deepika that&#39;s malti ..&amp; she uses her eyes beautifully .. I really felt that.. Deepika lived the character the voice ,the body language ,the portrayal everything is just perfect .. Hats off to her .. she deserves all the appreciation for this movie.🙌
Everyone actress wants to look more beautiful on the screen but deepika is so brave
Y the fu**ing hell would she do that she could’ve like lost her face forever

U did a great job dipika...<br>But taunting victims by making tiktok video on their face wasnt good...<br><br>Insteed of helping some victims u stand for JNU wasnt good...m not saying why u supported jnu...but why u didnt helped some victims...cant u go there to make them feel good...laxmi z not only the surviver...there are lakhs of like her...<br><br>U turned greedy over the years deepika...<br>Insteed of watching ur money making movie..i donated 150 to a acid victims site...

Hatss of to DP for having such guts to take up a character like Malti
And the sad truth is, Kabir Singh jaise movies hit hote hai but aise movies nhi hote!
Meghna Guljaar ❣️Deepu ❤️ Laxmi ❤️
I don&#39;t know why people are not going to watch this movie.This is a really good movie . it&#39;s really inspiring. I don&#39;t know what wrong with people why they are not liking this movie. It teaches you how a person has come out from this phase this hard time . It&#39;s really inspiring .plzzzz go and watch plzzzzz zzz zzz zzz
Deepika sucks
❤❤
She is an incredible actor
It is very shameful and disappointing that in our country many vulger movies and many adult movies and movies promoting drugs and alcohol earn 100 to 200 crores and a movie like chaapak which is a message for the society has earned just 28crores yet. People are boycotting this movie just because deepika joined jnu protest ,it was her personal wise to join the protest and it has nothing to do with her film why can&#39;t people understand .So please I request everyone please watch this movie for the sake of deepikas hard work. Megha gulzar and all the other actors hard work and for all the acid attack fighters.,🙏🙏🙏
I love you deepika! Kudos to your hard work!
Solute of u it is very emotional story.....<br>I really I&#39;m crrying when I see laxmi&#39;s <br>Story☹☹
Honestly ,It’s sad to see her <br>How tough time she went through god knows only.<br>Almost every asian country had huge problems with acid attackers back in 1996-2010<br>Specially in our country Bangladesh 🇧🇩 <br>I don’t know about before 1996 <br>But good thing is it has vanished from our society and country.<br>I am very happy about what our govt. has done for girls.<br>That’s why Bangladesh 🇧🇩 is no 1 in gender equality in asia.<br>So change comes slowly but govt needs to take serious action as well to make it more effective.
Achha laga  ab Indian  wale  sirf  deshbhakto  ki hi movie  hit  karate  h <br>Naa ki bharat  ke tukde  karwane  walo  ki
Boycott chhapaak
I don&#39;t understand why this amazing film got flopped😢😢😢
Fuckoff
I think the resemblance between Deepika and Laxmi is uncanny.. Why does nobody talk about this?
The film is too good and to emotional also I like this film from bottom of my 💓
Chhapaak should be nominated for Oscar and Deepika should  win  the best actress award
Any one noticed....she still has the RK tattoo on her back neck 🤭🤭 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo8LVOjK7-8&amp;t=77">1:17</a>
I got Goosebumps while watching this...Salute to everyone who related to this movie directly or indirectly ♥️
salute to depika mam.....
Dipika is very good actor
amazing!
I love dipeeka ❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyoLKvEPWZ4">https://youtu.be/kyoLKvEPWZ4</a><br>But I watched the movie because of the girl who suffered tragic situation. She is so strong.
Big salute for the effert👌👌👌👌👌
Hatsoff deepika mam
Chhapaak is an exceptional film, brought to life by three immensely talented women, @deepikapadukone @meghnagulzar and @atikachohan. This is great cinema, powered by the female gaze, do not miss this.
👎👎👎👎👎👎
Love U deepu.and malti

गैस पास करने में जितने कोण पर तिरछा होना पड़ता है<br><br><b>वही पादुकोण है</b> 🤔🤗
आप लोगो ने इतने अच्छे मुद्दे पर बनी फिल्म को केवल पब्लिसिटी और कमाई के लिए politics में घुस गई, Real character पर बनी movie में एसिड attacker का नाम मुसलमान से बदलकर हिंदू कर दिया 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Really one cant even imagine that the acid attack survivors go through..and great job done there to bring a mainstream film on this issue..lots of power to those brave girls and to deepika and meghna to share such a story among all!
Luv u Deepika mam
I think Deepika padukone is not Indian.. she does not hold Indian passport

It’s just a pity that I don’t live in India to watch Chhapaak... I hope the entire nation can do that on my behalf cause the movie seems to be nothing but beautiful... ✨🌷
Till beautiful my bae!♥♥♡♡<br>Love u jaan!
Brave beauty❤️
I think who  don’t like this movie they are not human just not working on box office doesn’t say this is totally flopped imagine just u as a malti  how hard is life going on and this is real story of acid survival who are going through it and this film show society ,country need to changed their thought and they have to show their love to acid survival people 🙏

I&#39;m Boycotter saw my reason (properly)<br>I can give my blood to her before she went to JNU but know she is nothing for me.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu_lAzg2L80">https://youtu.be/wu_lAzg2L80</a><br>Video Puri dekh KR comment my reply Dena Meri galti ho to btana
Great job, keep it up
The woman who did the Prosthetics deserves all the awards. she did an amazing job. Also it would have been interesting to hear from her as well.
Jnu Jake pura kachra Kar Diya! Lakshmi ki story barbaad Kar di
Those who tried boycot this movie will be in hell<br>Such a disgustiong people stupid<br>Everyone should nd must watch this movie<br>Please
Deepika sooo proud of you..i watched this movie i think you put on the right way in this industry ...this is what we waiting for..thankyou 😍love you lot..
Tukde tukde  team member shame on u
Deepika get best actor award   How many agree ?
Deeepikaa u r a star♥️
Ohhh really loves you dipika 😘😘😘<br>U r always my favorite ❤️
There  are actors whom we love to see on screen and then there are actors like deepika padukon who have surpassed admiration and have gone to the stage of pure respect and love. It is a feeling of utmost gratitude. thank you so so much
Stupid
Chhapaak is the best😉😉😉😍😍 and Deepika also😍😍😙
Just one thing ruined  this movie to cross 100 crore mark😢
How could anyone boycott this movie!!!!<br><br>It&#39;s not about JNU or Deepika , it&#39;s not about any political party, it&#39;s about the vicious thoughts in the minds of misogynists in our country !!!<br><br>So I urge you all to kindly go and watch the movie and let that brave girl know that we all as a nation are proud of her and the way she handled herself after such a brutal attack and that we stand together in protecting our daughters, sisters, wife and mother against such attacks in the future !!!
I have seen this movie it is very very very nice (in theatre)
Deepika you make me cry!!! I love you eternally! Endlessly ! Always!!?
Please, watch this film
Million billion salutes to deepika mama and chappak team as well👍
Sorry but magic didn’t happen on Screen! So many people have given their life for the country but I can at least boycott Deshdrohi’s movies 🤮
Publicity stunts for film promotions back fired.. may be movie is good but people not ready to pay for tuku da tukuda batch...
I don&#39;t like deepika personally due to her over reaction but her work in this movie 🙏🙏🙏
Yeh bahen JNU ja ke apna chehra kala karwa chuki hai aur movie bhi pit chuki hai commercially....to ab aise uske face ke make up ke video dikhane se kuchh bhi nahi milega......
This is the art........art of marketing and advertisement.....
لا يوجد عربي😢😢😢😭😭😭
Kudos
Love u deepu
Brilliant work by whole team of Chhapaak 🙏🙏🙏🙏 its a masterpiece created by all of u with so much genuine heart and so much hardwork!!! Loved the movie, loving every behind the scene, interview.... thanku for the awareness and praying that these attacks stop in the mind n then publically 🙏

thats why I always like deepika😍😍😍
To see that how much effort frm everyone has been putt in this movie ♥ great job to all the team of chhapaak n ofcoures luv u deeps you&#39;re such an inspiration for all of us ❤🌹❤
Love you Deepika mem
Or jaoooo JNU
Wow... Whatever is the fate of movie but noone can question Deepika&#39;s acting in this film, it was one of the best performances of the decade.
It was a wrong timing n strategy. But as a film it needs more viewers n appreciation
Extremely beautiful film..
Such an amazing and hardworking team...<br>Keep going
Deepika again proved that she can do it.........It can be anything
How can someone boycott this movie????/.............Don&#39;t they respect women?????............Don&#39;t they have mothers???????
No one is ever really appreciating the actual message in the  film for which deepika has worked so hard....all they care about is JNU....this IS exactly the reason why actors dont come out for protests coz this crazy audience is gonna create a nonsense out of it no matter wht
I am very proud of her......... 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Only Laxmi Agarwal That&#39;s all.
Ab itni bhi hit nhi hui h movie jo ye sab bhi dikhaya jaye views k liye ha souch ko appreciate aur support h
You&#39;re a gem Deepika,lots of love to you❤❤
Deepika just not given time to movie she given her soul also..hit like if agree
I liked the idea that the director has shown mostly the positive things malti is doing in the film rather than her pain and not focusing only on attacker’s things... which is very good so atleast these bloody attackers realise that life never stops...
Dipika mam my hard
Feeling sorry for the Director. She deserved more recognition through better earnings.
Amazing movie standing applause for the whole chappak team and d girls suffering out der with dis acid attack
I don’t get it why people want to boycott a film like this. It was beautiful and marvellous. I would encourage people to watch this amazing film. Also kudos to Deepika for such an amazing performance 🙌
Incredible work by chapaak team special Deepika you nailed it
so nice
👍
Deepika is always a best and she deserve the highest paid actress along with her acting skill<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23don">#don</a>&#39;t criticise deepika
best actor in my view 😘☺☺
Is the film worth watching? Please be honest because i have to choose between this film, good newz and tanhaji.
No one: <br>Lit no one:<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Deepika: i am CLAUSTROPHOBIC!!
She is absolutely queen of Bollywood

Show only jnu
Hats off deepika..ur such a mazing women and inspiration to all
This movie is very good...it empowers us awareness....great job...lovely
छपक् के न चल ने का कारण है दीपिका का गलत तरीके से movie को promot करना like करे
Chhapaak is nt very great story.Though it was painful story there are more painful &amp; tragic story than that.Think abt the movi &quot;The least of these&quot; which was based on the Australian missionary &amp; his two sons who were burnt alive by som local members in <a href="http://odisha.it/">Odisha.It</a> cost them their lives for helping lepers &amp; poor people.
The most dedicated, hardworking and humble actress ever seen in my whole life 💗💖
Seriously salute  to my fav actress  deepika mam and chhapaak team... really you guys  done a very good job 💕💕💕👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Omg bhut aohka makup
Nice Deepika 😍
I hate Deepika ....🖕🖕

I don&#39;t understand why people dislike
Dipika you r best actores
फिल्म बहुत अच्छे सब्जेक्ट पर बनी है ओर ज्यादातर लोगो को मूवी देखनी चाहिए, पर दीपिका के एक गलत कदम ( JNU) ने मूवी को फ्लॉप करवा दिया
Aur jao jnu politics can not be mixed with art
Ohh god ,so much of hard work, patience hats off to the entire team of chhapak
How someone can boycott such a sensible movie...<br>People should have supported this .....I loved this movie and effort
Deepika Ma&#39;am you are great ❤😍
My favorite deepika
Deepika  is wonderful actress  nd strong nd successful..<br>Hell to manipulate indian government
Can we just talk about Lakshmi&#39;s hair?? 😍
I am feeling sorry for the team of Chhapaak. This movie deserves the best performance at Box office. Plz go and watch it. Watch it for Laxmi Agarwal, at least
Hardwork leads to success👏💗
Deepika Mem u are very brave... strong there is no word to describe my emotions and feelings and love for this film
Seriously gave me goosebumps really u r awesome Deepika.
CHAAPAAK ♥♥<br>best ever film of this year
Amazing job 🙌💪
Please do not think this is about Malti&#39;s acid-attack trauma and would be painful to watch! Its more about her triumph over what she wanted to accomplish despite her downfalls! This is a must watch film!
This movie is actually appreciable .<br>I watched it  is just heart touching.
Deepika mam.. u r the best..loved it..
Deepika is love ❤️❤️🔥🔥 😘😢
Oh my God ........ Deepika worked so hard for this movie ....<br>She is most probably one of the most deserving actresses of Bollywood 😍😘😘
She has ruined the film by standing with tukde tukde gang
My favorite deepu😍
We love you mam 😘😘😘😘
Deepika is the best

मै लक्ष्मी जी के साथ जो हुआ उसका धिक्कार करता हु<br>और प्रार्थना करता हुँ भगवान उनको लाईफ मे कोई तकलिफ और ना दे बस खुशियाँ ही देता रहे मगर ये दिपिका मेघना ऐ सब सिर्फ दिखावा कररहे है ढोंग कर रहे है JNU मै सिर्फ Film चले ईसलिए एक ऐसे लकडे के साथ दिपिका खडी रही जिसने लकडी के साथ दुष्कर्म किया क्योंकी वो लडका कन्हैया कुमार खुले मै पिशाब कर रहा था अश्लिल हरकते कर रहा था तो ये हर Pramotion मै लक्ष्मि जी को आगे कर कर के अपनी दुकान चला रहे है फायदा उठा रहे हे लेकिन लोग इतने भी पागल नही रहे देश के सच्चे नागरीक जोहे जोसच मै Respect करते है देश का राष्र्ट का लडकीयोंका वो ईसका विरोध करेंगे शुरवात Dislike और Unsubscribe से करते है और एक मेघना गुलजार जो अच्धा है उसे बारबार दिखाना बोलना नही पडता हम अच्धे है वोह अपने आप पता चल जाता है.
