Deepika is so graceful ! The way she conveys her ideas without even a single chance of disrespecting someone is so commendable !
Who is watching it in 2024 👍
Arey india ke women safety ke bare me baat kar rahe ho hindi mein karlo angrezi kyon jhad rahe ho😢
Rani will kill the other ladies beside her 😂😂
Tabu trying to stay calm !
Ek common bat sabmein hai srk ne sbke sath kaam kiya hai😅😀
Anushka.....i liked her ....the way she is....n tapsi Pannu
I wish ki Priyanka yha hoti to inlogo ki jarurat hi nhi padti.
They are just cutting one other phrase or words
Yeah.. why Rani is saying to do marital art n all. It&#39;s true but why is our environment like that? Why we are not questioning, why this is happening.
I&#39;m imagining kangna among them to make rani stop😂
Rani answers 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rani &#39;s point was very correct...❤❤ All of you should think deeply ..then you will get her point.
I would kill for Deepika to play Diana two of my favourite favourite women❤❤
Why are these women not letting Tabu speak?
Anushka may be speaking fast cuz thats her way,i too speak fastly but i guess her points were best ❤😊
ngl rani really sounds like  auntie who judges women&#39;s character by their clothes.
Aditya Chopra bhi MeeToo accused hai kya?
I think in this Deepika and Rani both were correct with Their Opinions also Deepika agreed with Her Too. And Rani was correct when she said that Girls should know what they want or what they don&#39;t want , they should know how to fight and stand up for herselves like she said the girl should know how to say Backoff and No , also learning Marshall arts , because mostly in Rural areas Girls are not like that constructed as Deepika said so, also Rani also wants to convey the main point same as Deepika want to convey that the Upbrining of The Childrens whether it&#39;s a Girl or A Boy They both should know about the sex education , mental harassment,  molestation all the Things.<br>They should have to aware about the Most Important things also i think everyone have to learn to be Positive and embracing The worst moments in the Life is called an Art...As a girl i can feel both were right with their own experiences and mindset Deepika was so True ki Aisa hona hi nahi chaiye , aisi situations aani hi nahi chaiye but we can see the world reality check everyday in every newspaper we get the Rape Reports so are we still Changing...? Gradually we are changing and Hope we all can make Better ourselves as Anushka said in the last we should be kind and Good with each other ; everything will be solved.. Also Rani said it correct the mothers and not only Mothers but the Whole Family should thought and encourage girls to Learn how to stop a Bad guy from doing bad Deeds and stand up for herself also at the same time ; To a boy they should teach how to Respect a Girl and they should also Teach ki in not a joking way Never insult any Girl ; Boys should learn how to be kind in Difficult situations <br>I heard mostly boys to abuse their Girls in a wrong way ; also i said mostly not everyone 🤝💙but i think this is the one or many things which boys and girls should be aware and learn about all the things how we can make this world a better place and Respecting everyone Out There.❤<br><br>In instagram idk why People were thinking that Rani is wrong I cannot see her wrong; she is telling what she learnt from her own experiences and I loved whole This and I think we need more such Debate and social Topics for a Talk ; due to this our knowledge also Gets better Day by Day💖🤝also on more of Social Topics which are more Important Like alia said Ladies Employment that is a huge topic💪
Stupid rani....she is thinking she is boss here...but she is bakwas
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3450">57:30</a> can anyone please tell me what alia said. Which character she&#39;s talking about?
Rani is a not at all a good listener. I don&#39;t think she is ready for depth that Deepika is trying to bring. I feel sorry for you Deepika
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2250">37:30</a> so according to Rani if a woman says back off the five men which were ready to rape her will back off? Such a bs point. Her whole take on this is just not it. She is the woman who&#39;ll say &quot;why didn&#39;t you say no&quot; when someone gets raped
Only Deepika, Tabu and Tapsee answered the actual question about what they learnt from the year lol
Rani❤
Really stunned to see the mediocres talk so much when the genius is quiet… people know who im talking abt
I feel like rani interrupted Anushka many time...
Completely agree with Deepika But didn&#39;t know these kind of really good content available but people not viewed yet, i came here after watching instagram random reel
i want to take a moment and appreciate Alia for this one. she really spoke from her heart and laid out the modern thinking which, ofcourse, others did too with such elegance, but she did the same with clarity and belief which stood out for me. such a great interview. inspired by these awesome women.❤
Rani is so bore🤦‍♂️
Shahrukh has acted with all of actors in this round table till date 👍👍
Inki maki chu** kabhi Hindi me bhi bola kro <br>Taki ham ko samaj me aye <br>Sirf video dhekhata hu <br>Lekin kuch samaj me nahi ata
TABU , the Swag girl
Rani&#39;s mentality is quite out of date so she is feeling little insecure and trying to get the attention. Obviously she is from the generation where heroines were use as props in the movie.
I don&#39;t know for what reason but alia was trying to prove every statement that taapsee made ,it was irritating and disrespectful to begin with ,like even if alia had different opinion than taapsee then atleast let her complete her thing but alia jumps in and disagrees with it .
I mean rani was partially right that if practically considering there&#39;s so much abuse happening and women need to take a stand but you can&#39;t tell a 10 year old to learn martial arts coz it&#39;s so called important for you to protect yourself. Why are we nullifying the fact that it&#39;s the assaulter&#39;s fault. Periodt. I don&#39;t wanna be someone who always has to consider that someone might molest me or that I can&#39;t sit in a rickshaw that&#39;s empty. It&#39;s bullshit. Teach your sons and daughters how to respect each other. Make and mind boundaries and if we all stand up in crowds for people then they can also be strong enough to stand for themselves and others coz definitely it&#39;s a hard place to be in.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1360">22:40</a>
ye toh ladai ho gayi bhaaii..
Tabu is way more mature than all of them 👏
From today&#39;s generation.. I admire ANUSHKA the most. She doesn&#39;t act poise or act elegant. She is very strong personality wise. Not any made up personality 💖
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=468">7:48</a> she&#39;s talking about Kabir Singh
Whenever I have nothing to do i come here to watch this.. So fun😂😂
i wanted kangana here
Rajeev masand was not asking SSR a lot and also he was asking SSR at the last even after diljit, like seriously. The whole bollywood is SHIT
Anushka = Chabad chabad
Exact like group discussion 😁
See how Deepika spoke with so much of poise
Anushka she is so real❤
Rani Mukerji is behaving like self-obsessed know-it-all and done it all...truly obnoxious as a prrsonality and praising herself which takes some sense of deluaion to do so in fron of Tabu who is one of the terrific actresses indian cinema has ever seen but still so humble yet respectfully opinionated
😅
Actually I&#39;m big fan of DP but What about anushka ... I can listen her whole day ....such a wise words
Imagine Deepika as Princess Diana !!
never ever knew Rani Mukerji was so annoying and uneducated
Film actors are so dumb but they think they are sophisticated
Waaooo tapseee
Tabu and Deepika are such poised women, listening carefully, with no facial expressions and giving out valid points. Alia should have been replaced by Priyanka. It&#39;s a shame Priyanka couldn&#39;t sit here. Alia is a brilliant actor but has terrible social skills, let alone knowledge. She is privileged and her experiences are so invalid. Rani is giving our &quot;Pick me up&quot; girl vibes. She is quite influenced by the men around her, some of her words are even sound spelt out by men, I did feel some of her opinions did sound like Amir Khan and then she went out and said she had a crush, which obviously is a coincidence.   Quiet oblivious of the real issues people face in their lives and society. Subtle comments like &quot; I keep all things in my memory I had some respect for her and it&#39;s done. Horrible. Should have got Vidya Balan here, someone more sensible and aware of life and work struggles.
as much as i love Rani as an actor... this one interview was enough to make me dislike her as a person... saying some really problematic opinions, not hearing what others are speaking, and interrupting others when they are answering their question
The best is tabbyu so ethereal.. Not wanting to speak up like the commoners😂 and then tapsee.. So intelligent and honest.. And then anushka.. Straiggtgotward
My respect for Deepika and Anushka increased
Tabu&#39;s statement mere toh character sab mar jaate hai agar was lit😂
Aaliya is worst.
Alia is so cute yaar ❤
Rani is so fucking tone deaf about the Me Too issue, a classic case of internalised misogyni.
So damn loud🥲
Honestly speaking,I think Rani is logical. We cannot wait for others to change. Changing ourselves is better than getting molested while waiting for others to change isn’t it? There are some men who will just not change. I don’t know why a bunch of illiterate, illogical people are trolling Rani. Like dude get a life
Except Rani , all are Buch of fools and parasites, they live in utopia!
Ye american interview h ya indian 😏
Always rocks aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ❤️❤️❤️
Whats wrong with rani
As far as acting and craft is concerned, I think tabu is above all of them. She is the only who can be compared with the league of phenomenal actresses like smita patil, shabana azmi, meena kumari, Nutan and Sridevi.
Everyone speaking on top of one another...like a zoom call in network latency
The whole video I&#39;m literally waiting for tabu to speak n the moment she opens her mouth to say something someone or the other just has to interrupt... Oh pls stfu it&#39;s so annoying I tell u
Rani is so annoying in this interview
Petition to make Rani stop talking
Tapsee alia Anushka irritating 😖
Tabu is intellectual and then Rani mukhargy speaking sense.. Rest r just shouting desperately to prove their points.. Alia, deepika, anushka r dumb.. Tapsi is somewhat better
inn log yeh chips kyun ni kha rahe hain
Aliaaaaa ❤❤❤❤
dont get why social media made rani villain....she has different point of view to defend women
Who wants Ashwariya, Dia Mirza, Raveena, Sushmita, Tabu, PC, Vidhya, Kangana and Konkana in the same room. They make sense when they talk.
Why are these women blabbering about Metoo...Tabu should have been asked that question bcz she has seen the toughest part of Bollywood. She being silent on it speaks a lot.
I love Rani but she is speaking such dumb things...such simplification of things and interrupting everyone, finishing their sentences ..so annoying
Katrina kaif should be der🫠
Anushka ne AJ tak koi movie me achi acting nahi ki hai . Uski jitni movies hai usme Anushka ke jagah koi dusri heroin rhti to b kuch fark nahi pdta ..jitni movie chali h sb hero k karn chali h
I don&#39;t agree with Rani on the front that not every situation is the same, but you have to agree that she&#39;s not entirely wrong. The world is brutal, while it needs to change its not something that will happen overnight. It is better to atleast have the fight in you, the survival instinct. Do not be under the impression that it won&#39;t ever happen to you, just know how to survive in a bad situation.
Tabu is very good in this entire interview..🔥🔥🔥🙌 this is what strong personality is.
Where is Aiswarya Rai 🥺🥺
Anushka is so fun loving, smart,classy, and matured too also no doubts drop dead gorgeous ❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3366">56:06</a> She is so want to play them . Great Actress Tabu ❤
Deepika&#39;s reaction to Ranveer singh saying &#39; ab mardon ki fat ti hai&#39; is everything ❤❤
I would love to see rani in Deepika&#39;s role of Padmavat
Deepika is such a good listener
rani is such a pick me 💀
Rani really needs a brain cell booster!! Does she hear herself when talking??
What is it that Rani said at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=629">10:29</a>?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2385">39:45</a> Rani in her mind as if she said something life changing 🙄
All of them are great women but I personally love Anushka to be so real and straight forward and Rani maam for spitting the real facts.
Out of all present bollywood actresses Deepika, Anushka, Kangana, Tabu, Priyanka &amp; Vidya are opinionated women with brains and voice that could inspire. Would love to see them all in one roundtable. That would be lit.
Omg Rani just needs to shut up and stop inserting her in every single person’s response!
Thank god i never liked Rani, I&#39;m proud of my choice.
rani mukherji talking absolute crap
All are boring except Tabbu
Exactly @deepikapadukone . We need more healed nervous systems and low cortisol levels in brain. Ofcourse defence will be needed, but that shouldn&#39;t be our forever aim. We need compulsory TRAUMA TRAINING in schools more importantly than Martial arts training. @ranimukherjeeeofficial
why Rani&#39;s wearing chapri glasses
Iam sorry but no class...... In this interview... No professional way. No respect... Everyone overlapping each other
Aliaa bhat is totally ignored looks like alia is seating like a kide her
No offence , but see a male actors roundtable<br><br>They are like speaking line wise . Pehle aap bol lo and see the women&#39;s one 😂😂 <br><br>Girls will be girls
Haha Alia puri natkiye hai
Honestly I love deepika but she&#39;s boring. She thinks too much before saying something.
It is hilarious how Anushka is interfering every time Deepika talks.
I loved how Rani mukherjee became the warden among all girls saying now it&#39;s her turn to talk and now its her turn 😀😀
Rani mukherjee is sooo irritating
Someone get a tape and put it on Ranis mouth what a fuckin boomer
How can 1 person pass so many problematic statements? I officially hate Ranji Mukherjee now👍
Except Alia and Tapsee everyone is better in this roundtable
Rani and Tapsee were sooooo annoying like throughout
i am irritated so much by rani mukherjee existence on that table
i would gladly like to teach rani mukherjee some things about ASSAULT. we don&#39;t live in jungles gurl
Got connected to tapsee,anushka and deepika in this Conversation of this round table.👏<br>Tabu was super quite and rani was super high and alia was just ok
Except tabu G    Chachad pappad adha to suna b nhi 😅😅😅😅
Deepika Padukone...she has so calmness and patience while speaking and listening. Love her
People are unnecessarily pointing out rani!<br>She is somewhere right, bcoz we cant correct other ppl<br>The least we can do is we can b strong ourselves..
Alia batli is so so sooooo irritating n annoying 😒
Can&#39;t tolerate rani
What tabbu said what she kept from haiders set?
Rani- we can&#39;t go to hundreds of mothers and teach them how to raise their children<br><br>But, what&#39;s media doing?
at 31 minutes, deepika loved Ranbir, stupid guy, lost a beauty!
These actresses are some of the best. truthfully, except deepika.. i have not yet seen her in a groundbreaking role.<br>Rani- as the blind girl<br>Alia- as a victim of sexual abuse<br>Tabu- as an indian american wife of a scientist<br>Anushka- as a cancer patient. <br>I think i would like to see deepika in such roles. <br>Radika would have made this group perfect.
See like Rani blabbering... I am working for 20 years... In some great movies... Same even tabu with some award winning movies and content driven film&#39;s... Humble.. Listening
Imagine Kajol was sitting here... How this interview would have turned !!?😂🤣❣️🔥
Rani is so annoying she is again &amp; again interrupting someone or the other. It&#39;s like she has to give answers &amp; take control of this discussion otherwise someone will beat crap out of her.She is good as actor but she really does not know how to behave while having discussion. She is making the session fishmarket. Also her opinion on &#39;me too&#39; was just disgusting. If simply men could have been brought up the right way &amp; understand &#39;no&#39; these situations wouldn&#39;t have been happened. Even self defence does not work many times.
Tabu really deserves an Oscar for sitting there with these women for such a long time..so calmly..class act!<br>I mean everyone apart from Tabu are just self praising themselves..Alia Rani Anushka are so annoying, they just kept interrupting the whole time, so dumb of them! Tabu we love you ♥️
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1268">21:08</a> aliya saying u have to mix it up a bit and she now playing gangubai 😝
Tabu isa great actor
Anushka is literally the India Eminem
Lagta hai Alia Fair And Lovely laga ke baithi hai
All of them were good, please Rani stop behaving like Aaunty.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3251">54:11</a> now she is married to him wow
Rani ka part auto skip krne ka kuc option h kya ??🫣
Missing Kangna n vidya
@57.30  @Aliabhatt  How Brilliant !! <br>U deserve n Oscar 💥 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bestanswer">#bestAnswer</a>✨
I&#39;ve never despised Rani before, but now i do. Smell of desperation is strong
Anushka ❤😘❤😘❤
Anushka ❤❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘
Generation gap explained should be the videos name
I think Kriti Sanon should be there next time she will  the perfect for these type of debate
Why won’t Rani let others talk.
रानी तो हिचकी पे ही अटकी है😂😂😂
Rani sitting there behaving like Mrs Yash Raj. She knows she owns the big production house which launched Anushka. She also wanted to be given a special treatment.
Alia is soooo down to earth and relatable
Yeh
It’s sad to listen rani speak like this about meto movement
Rani is the best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=328">5:28</a> Tabu literally got scared by Anushka and Tapsee 😅
Why is Tapsee at this table?
Very good listener:<br>Tabbu, Dipika, Tapasi<br><br>Very Bad listener:<br>Rani only..<br><br>Average listener:<br>Aliya, Anushka
Rani cutted other sentences many times 🙄🙄
Rani please learn listened to other people also..!😭🙄
Feels like a group discussion in campus interview 😂
Alia was going to say my father wrote really wrong characters for women...and then she corrected it..oh no no really strong characters for women😂😂😂..ironically hilarious 😂
Rani was annoying at tyms, deepika as usual poised n sweet, Alia was cute, Tabu seems introvert, Tapsee spoke her heart as usual, Anushka has strong opinions... Overall a good interview.. Rani should let others complete..
Katrina kaif is omnipresent in this interview.
Alia be like my father my father my father my dad ...... aryy stupid u dont have ur own opinion
Raazi was too good<br>Alia love u❤
Taapsee so beautiful
I praised a lot to Rani for mardani but now I dont think she deserved this movie
Tabu is a far better actress than all of them combined.
Comment section is full of people judging these actresses! Oh godddd people can&#39;t stop judging at any cost! All are good! Let them do whatever they want to! Can people be stop being so judgemental??
What if they go to bigg boss thn ...what will happen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2100">35:00</a>
Deepika and alia ❤❤😍
I come here After actors round tables Video. In this video actress continuosly interrupt each other
actress roundtable k har episode me..... 🤢 &quot;Alooiya BHATTu &quot; kahe rhti hai.. mood kharab ho gya
Who is favourite actress in thish 5
Anushka koi batan band karo
Ye dekh muze parliment ki yad aa gai 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Alia bhatt obsesssd by her father
The only person I want to hear on this table is Tabu.
Difference between male actors roundtable and female is that male talks to rajeev and answer questions and they are talking with each other😂
usa tv is spn, vampires aur kya hai:D
Taapsee Pannu has my heart!
Deepika to Rani mukharjee &quot; Are bas kr bhai &quot; 🤣
FISH MARKET
People saying Deepika .answered gracefully a d intelligently..but I think....it&#39;s just because she was sitting poised.....<br>I don&#39;t think she answered well<br>She even dodged the question....<br>Like that johar one ....she could.not justify ....that ..<br>That portrayal of johar was not good ..even if you tell or show story at current ..times...you should be cautious that is should not glorify ...anything ...like that ..any ritual like that ....sati or johar
I cant believe rani as a mother of a very young daughter is saying that like wake up woman anyway lost whatever little respect or say liking i had for her
Honestly all of this actresses gave their 100% in their films but this round table feels like a whatsapp group chat where everyone is hurriedly trying to talk on the topic before it gets changed 💀. But this was inspiring to watch, thank you for this. I hope u invite more actresses like Shraddha Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra in the upcoming round tables.
Why is rani not letting other&#39;s speak🤷🏻‍♀️
Rani is the reason the Me Too Movement is important. She is the very problem that she addresses.
I fell in love with Taapsee after watching this. She&#39;s so much fun as well as sensible. And idk why everyone is praising Tabu for sitting quiet there, I mean it&#39;s an interview and you&#39;re actually supposed to talk , but I really admire her as an actress (She&#39;s splendid). And everyone in the table weren&#39;t fighting as most ppl in d comments say, they were putting their points. Enjoyed the whole thing. Hope we get to see more different and unique movies like this with talented stars  in the upcoming years.
i dont like rani&#39;s bossy behavior.
machhi market bana dia...
Why aren&#39;t they eating those nachos 🙄
Where is priyanka chopra and Shraddha Kapoor💜💜
Comment section shows that no one care about alia bhatt
N the award for the most annoying  actress goes to  Rani 😂  she definitely needs to cultivate the art of listening
It&#39;s amazing to see that the present generation of actresses is so secure of their place in the industry and that they take themselves seriously as artists instead of being mere show-pieces in films. It&#39;s also nice to see all these women appreciating each other&#39;s work so generously.
Deepika is looove! So thoughtful and graceful :&#39;) I will literally love her forever :&#39;)
Alia talking foolishly
Best - Taapsee ( she knows very well what is she saying, loved the way she spoke, loud and clear)<br>Good - Anushka (spoke honestly and confidently), Deepika (good listener)<br>Worst - Rani (Disgusting, Irritating, Arrogant, Stupid) 🙄🙄🙄🙄
My focus was on Deepika i mean she was hilarious😂😂🤣
Rani just seems so out of touch with the real world. Even during the interviews she did for the promotion of Mardaani 2, you could see she was spewing a lot of insensitive and dismissive nonsense. She&#39;s a good actor but clearly does not acknowledge her privilege.
Tabbu ..<br>Tera khoon kab  khaulega Re🤪😀
Rani mukherjee interact much
I didn&#39;t watch the whole video,i just came through comment section because i knew you people must have mentioned the time stamp when something epic would have happened in the conference 😂😂😂
What if kangana is there🤹‍♂️🤔🙄
Anushka&#39;s sentences travel like a tracer bullet.
Tabu ma&#39;am❤️
I think rani was promoting mardaani 2
35.20 deepveer alert❤
One thing rani said we should also recognize actor who are supporting actors that actor can do any thing no matter if its a lead role or what if u are good actor then u can make any role memorable
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3410">56:50</a> was the best reaction of alia she was like rani kitna bolti hain haha i know this is disrespectful but if i was there i wuld have also did that i know everyone has the right to speak but when there is going a good conversation first thing which is important is to listen others
30/5/2021
Everyone has come dressed up for a roundtable except for alia bhatt who has come to attend a party.🎉🎉
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3085">51:25</a>srk
Rani is the &quot;I KNOW IT ALL&quot; senior . <br>Tabu is the COOLEST SENIOR. <br>Anushka is the chapar chapar chapar...🤣<br>Tapsi is the good girl..appreciating , listening to all &amp; sharing her things..<br>Alia is now finally mature. <br>Deepika thinks too much or pretends to think too much to say the simplest things. 🤣
Deepika inspiration is Diana and she used to watch her news!!. What a lier Deepika brought up in India only and there was no social media or no YouTube how she used to knew before that to watch her in news?? . By the way Diana died 26 years back .
Tapsee is looking so beautiful...i think she is awsm in girls here❤️
Every time I see anushka I just want him to ask anything from cricket 😂😂
They just keep cutting each other , goddamnit
Tabu❤️❤️
PERIOD::<br><br>ALL these bunch of people are talking about Content, story and so on about a film...why no one is talking about their acting....😂😂😂😂 Hum audience tum logo ki acting bhi dekhte hai😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=467">7:47</a> you did judwaa 2 😳
Rani mam har chees mai ghuste hai <br>No doubt she is a amazing actor
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3245">54:05</a></b><b> Doesn&#39;t matter who the girls are, they are always curious to know about crushes</b> 😂😂
Tabu&#39;s expression at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2066">34:26</a> hearing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> 😂
NH10 was storytelling at its best. With nuance, context and also explored the roles of multiple women pre-determined roles under the umbrella of social structure and patriarchy. Some women oppress other women, some are constantly oppressed, some can break away from it because of their privilege - but eventually, every woman has a role to play that is almost always determined by the patriarchy. Even the one privileged enough to think otherwise.
Rani&#39;s view on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> speaks more of her unconsciousness towards the atrocities that actually <a href="http://exist.it/">exist.it</a> bends towards stubbornness and unacceptance of the varieties that is actually out there.she sounds like a  rich, privileged person who blames the poor for the clout of poverty they are stuck in.she needs to go out more or read more
Rajalpal Yada Aur Johnny Lever Bulana Chahiye Edgar😂
Rani can u please shut up🙂
Am i the only one who find it very weird that Deepika always looks down towards the floor when someone is talking! I get all the paying attention crap.But its really weird like not ALL THE TIME🤢<br>Also i just noticed that she does that same weird thing while she is talking herself.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3244">54:04</a>
Anushka 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Apologies on behalf of Rani Guys..... i guess because of those Huge Yellow Glasses she couldnt Read the questions properly 😀😀😀
Ye alia ko kisne bithaya yha? 😂
Isn&#39;t Anushka mam sooo real d jsst always be herself rather than impostering ! GREATTTT.... KEEP IT UP!
The more of Alia,I see.The more I like her.
Katrina should also be there for zero Babita Kumari
Rani mukherji k 50 rs. Kaato
Came here 2 years later and Rani is still extremely irritating!
Alia and tapsi mujhe psnd h😍😍😍 anushka aur dipika bekar lgte h😂
My lady crush is Anushka Sharma
Sab dass rahe the...except tabu
Actors roundtable is much more sensible than actresses. This is a catfight.
I like alia she is a talented actress
Really bothered by Rani&#39;s response on the Me too movement. Never expected this from her.<br>Literally, everyone was so disgusted because of her response.
Deepika is so talented, humble and kind. I love her so much :)
I love everyone here except alia and tapsee and I love deepi the most
Tapasee .. so confident girl.. so amazing girl ..💝
All these actresses r nothing infront of Rani<br>Tabu and Rani have more talent all the others combined
Kangana ko bitha do in gavaron k bich🔥
Wish Sushmita Sen was just sitting with them to teach them how to create a sweet conversation.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3360">56:00</a>  When Tapsee mentioned Indira Gandhi i got goosebumps🔥<br>I totally agree with Tapsee.... What a woman🔥 💯
Rani Mukherjee has lost her fucking mind living with her caveman millionaire husband! She used to be very polite &amp; somewhat wise when she was an actress with an average background trying to make it!
Deepika so beautiful
For a while I thought Deepika was talking about Diana penty 😂😂<br>Jokes apart I too admire Princess Diana...
Taapsee ❤️❤️❤️
Everyone else hates rami Mukherjee so much and rightly soo
Rani is annoying...
XD its funny, i have seen many roundtables and usually they wait to say something when someone&#39;s speaking. Or apologize for speaking over someone. This one is so annoying cause they keep speaking over each other.
Heroines are so talkative when heroes come they let everyone talk 😂😂
Deepika and Anushka❤️❤️<br>Anushka might speak louder and thus people point out towards her interruption <br>But she can&#39;t be cut in between even rani could not<br>She spollke everything so bravely and everything she spoke was❤️
BAS KAR RAAAANI
correct
anushka itni tej bolti hai
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2400">40:00</a> blame women at the end. MA ne yhi sikhaya hoga 🙄
Only for Tabu
Rani Mukherjee and Alia Bhatt commenting on Me 2 who are a product of Nepotism makes India laugh 😁😁😁😁. I believe they are the spokesperson for the nepo gang  😁😁😁😁
Alia❤️❤️❤️
Lol Alia saying she has a crush on Ranbir ...cut to 2020 they are about to get married ..lucky girl 😂
These comments are so regressive 🙄
i was fine with rani even aftwr reafing all the comments...... Before <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a>
Alia Bhatt says ranbirr so cutely
These people talk more and work less
Boycott Alia Bhatt 💩💩🤮
I want to take time to appreciate Anushka for being so real and straightforward throughout the interview....<br>she was so good
Anushka was the most real and straightforward here<br>Deepika and Tapsee were also good.....
Y tis rani aunty is behaving like a school principle
Alia, anushka and rani just lost a lot of respect from me and tabu, Deepika, Taapsee earned a lot of respect
Tabu is me in gatherings. Except the thing that those nachos would be gone in a minute.
Rani is understanding every questions but answering so stupidly.
All the druggists together 👍
Tabu be like &quot;oh these girls today, I have been there and done better films than all of them combined&quot;😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=612">10:12</a> at this age where everyone wants to be the scene-stealer  and grab all the attention , I like how rani brought back the idea that its more important that the film itself is great and you&#39;re playing some part in it, now that part in itself might not be that important. so whats more important ? you being great and doing a lot in a so-so film or you being so-so and doing little in a great film ? INTERESTING
What??? They got Alia but not Neena Gupta?? She gave the best performance in 2018!!
10k th comment 😉🤩
Alia still playing cute girl image 🧐
Deepika is thinking too much before forming a sentence 🧐
Taapsee and Anushka talking at 2x speed 😁
Kudos to Tabu for even sitting there
Rani is behaving like Indian aunties who&#39;s advising younger girls to behave 🧐
I thought Rani is thoughtful not talkative but this changes my opinion 🙄
Rani is so irretating in this interview
From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=305">5:05</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=315">5:15</a> just stare at alia&#39;s face she like Anushka I am the show stealer not you 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Alia.. I&#39;m ur biggest biggest biggest fan in the universe. I get the proudest feeling ever when I see u n remember the right choice I made of loving u. You&#39;re so talented n loved, yet so humble n down to earth. You&#39;re so kind, friendly, helpful n positive. You&#39;re genuine, always being yourself, honest, cool n fun. You&#39;re so damn beautiful inside out. Everything &#39;bout u is awesome n admirable, so I admire it. Thank u for teaching me soooooo much and thank u for everything! ILU!
in 10.43 anuska was just lit
everyone is speaking when its their turn<br>they are also speaking when its tabu&#39;s turn
After sushant death <br>It&#39;s all fake,  hahahahaa Rajeev
go ahead
Why no one&#39;s talking about Alia!!😂
The leader(Tabu) stands apart, even though she spoke little.
Whose here after Rani&#39;s clip for martial arts is going viral on twitter?? 😂
Why do people like to compare women soo much all of them are successful accomplished women and are intellectual and beautiful queens!!!❤️❤️
Which movie was Tapsee talking about?
tbh everything alia says in this interview makes me laugh
Miss katina
Love alia
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=478">7:58</a> Anushka looks like &quot;Isko abhi khaayun ya thodi der ke baad khaayun?&quot;
For what reason Alia is here?? oh wait Talent &amp; Alia dont go hand in hand she is here only for her Dharma Father figure 😎
Ranking in terms of this interview:<br>1.) Tabu<br>2.) Taapsee<br>3.) Deepika <br>4.) Rani<br>5.) Alia (stop acting like a 15 year old kid, looks fake)<br>6.) Anushka ( annoying to another level)
Any random part you click on the video it is Rani Mukerjee speaking absolute rubbish.
why they are overlapping on eachother?? specially rani ? why  ladies y ?? tabu must be feeling bored there , Rani is interrupting too much .
Alia is worst among all who agree with me
Malia&#39;s stupid expressions
Anushkaa Ko Rapper banna chahiye🙄
Although Anushka is right, it feels like she&#39;s in a competition.
One minute silence for rani glasses.
Deepika is so calm and so intelligent ❤️
Happiness sisters happytoo
Excepting rani and anushka... All are druglers 🤐🙄
I love all of them accept anushka
Deepika is wearing a curtain or what😂😂
Rani irritated me to an entirely different level. Some of the things that she said were right but the context of it wasnt right at all. She needs to understand that.
Love anushka Deepika alia tabu Taapsee. ❤️❤️❤️<br>As for Rani, go back and INTROSPECT.
Need to kick out Rani Mukherjee and Alia Bhatt out of this, Rani Mukherjee get the fact that even young girls and kids are getting molested and you expect them to perform kung fu and get out of that situation when they can&#39;t even understand what&#39;s happening to them because they&#39;re children and too young to know about it or understand, do you understand the amount of trauma they go through once they figure out what happened to them and they can&#39;t even figure out how to express it or where to go for help or to be in a safe space and even for adults, we are not robots, our mindset is different, some women have the courage to fight in those situations but that&#39;s only in few cases because if there are many men and if a woman tries to fight, she&#39;ll be injured or hurt more and most of them are scared and go numb and that&#39;s not their fault, it&#39;s the men&#39;s fault or the accused&#39;s fault who does this shit to woman to make them feel unsafe and go numb or go through any kind of pain, fucking point the finger at the culprit not the victim, when will these aunties like Rani and the society revolving around them learn it?<br>And coming to Alia Bhatt, in the starting itself she mentions that women have been getting good roles for a while especially since the time her dad has been directing, how privileged you must be to live in a bubble, have any idea what kind of treatment women or young girls go through to get even a shot as a sidekick even in an ad, they are put through casting couches etc. The youth does not need morons like you to be televised and hear you speak absolute crapshit. <br>Thanks and Regards,<br>The youth who&#39;s trying to break this path set by hypocrites.
Why is everyone talking over each other ..smh ...
Never bring Alia at least <br>Showing case 😂😂<br>I like Your show
Here for deepika n dapu😘😘😘😘😘💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Tabu ❤
Rani is trying so hard to stay relevant😂
Deepika&#39;s eyes are so intense and mesmerizing !!
None of them are actresses... We all know what kind of work they do at night for extra income... Bollywood= sex industry. Stop all this bullshit.
Look how all praising each other but behind the walls pictures are otherwise such gangs of fakers n double standards in Nalawood sucks really. By the way where the our Queen Kangana Ranaut ❤️🔥?? Real talents ko bulate ni in jokers ko bitha rakha h n wife of Aditya Chopra is really something 🤣👎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3240">54:00</a> 😁😁
Rani &quot; kick in between Legs &quot; ...<br>The best of her  bad moments of this interview...<br>And Deepika &quot; self defense&quot; <br>....<br>Rani....bakwass bakwaass <br>Because....<br>In that me too every one becom gloomy afraid....Rani then started &quot;kicking&quot;...
Arrange The Order of Acting Ability...<br><br>1. Tabu <br>2. Deepika<br>3 Tapsee<br>4 Anushka<br>5 Rani <br>6 Aliya ...<br>Tapsee you are superb Love your works ...Pink Mulk Badla Naam Shabana You are great
I dont understand how can Alia and Deepika be okay with each other dont they have self respect? Idk I find Padukone faking it all together. Chee yaar ranbeer
Rani was really bad<br>Alia was really bad<br>Taapsee was fine<br>Anuska was fine<br>Tabu was amazing<br>Deepika was amazing
Alia Bhatt has no business sitting there
Tabu is like &#39;anyways i&#39;m not being paid for this interview, so why should i just waste my energy speaking/answering for every question...let my presence be felt&#39; 😁
Yeh talent mein alia bhatt kaha se aa gayi??
yaar ye rani pani k chashma...hahaha
I watch only for alia.
Alia is so cute.
This is my opinion.. Opinions matter..<br>Rani is a brainless bimbo. She has no brain. <br>Deepika has non sense quiet attitude and she acts smart<br>Alia is careless and extrovert<br>Taapse is shy and sweet<br>Tabu is calm and just <br>Anushka is bold and straight forward
What is Tabu doing among mortals?
Who will agree here that conservations with actors are better then with actresses though actresses are beautiful and good to see but not pleased to hear
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3405">56:45</a>  Alia making fun of Rani with Anushka<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3172">52:52</a>
The hype that Rajeev created in the beginning of the video and the actual video !!! 😂😂
I laughed when alia said his father wrote great roles for women
Anushka&#39;s ex is deepika &#39;s hus<br>Deepika &#39;s ex is Alia&#39;s bf 😄wow!😎
Alia doesn&#39;t think at all before speaking. And while she talk she stops and think. ▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一Alia.
1st time I  have seen deepika and anushka together on screen.
Rani is behaving like a aunty and alia like a kid
someone put a tape on Rani&#39;s mouth she has lost it seems.
Phele baar rani Mukerji Alia Bhatt se zyada cringe lageee
There is so much to eat on the Table ...why don&#39;t they just eat without thinking anything...
Came back after one year to this and it&#39;s still unbearable AF 😂
just listen to it at 2x <br><br>it&#39;s so funny😂😂🤣🤣
Anushka Sharma ❤️❤️❤️
Q - What is the difference between a male and a female ?<br>Ans - Watch &#39;Actors&#39; round table first and then this.
Rani has the intelligence to talk truth
Came here only for Tabu ... And best part is she spoke the least 😃🙄😒😒😒
You are I love you dear
Deepika&#39;s dress is awesome
Everyone hearing Rani patiently because of Aditya Chopra.
Alia is Dumbest of All....No Idea What&#39;s Going On..
WHERE IS THE KANGANA...RATHER THAN THESE..THEY ARE FINEST REALLY
What is wrong with anushka..Her voice is...
I don&#39;t why alia seems so uninterested in other&#39;s conversations.🙄🤔
For those people who wants to listen to tabu : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=598">9:58</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1109">18:29</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1600">26:40</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3109">51:49</a> .<br>Thank me later .😊😊
Absolutely mindless discussion.
Okay but Alia is way too self obsessed
These are the so called &#39;woke&#39; bollywood bimbos lmfao except Tabu<br>Their combined IQ and EQ is lower than that of Kangana&#39;s .
Deepika and anushka 💛💛❤❤💛💛💙💙
KANGANA RANAUT is the best actress, but she&#39;s not in this round table . Is it then the round table of best actress&#39;s 😂😂🤣🤣😂
Rajeev played smart here. In every other round tables he mostly points out questions to an individual but here he kept most questions open ended and saw everyone being impatient and my God this Alia, misbehaved character
Except Tabu all are pure garbage
Rani is cringe fest.
Start hating Rani.. on me too topic
tubu is good Listener..
Looks like these people are here to only proof how successful they are🙄🙄 except two really talented ladies deepika and tabu😘😘😘 and i love that ki unhone bolbachhan nhi kiya yha pr kyunki jis m baat hoti h uhne bolne ki jarurat nhi padti h...vo duniya apne aap dekh leti h😍😍 deepika in padmavat and tabu in andhadun😍😍
Nobody is talking about the audience. None of your films will work without audience. Audience is the king. Covid 19 just proved it.
Tabu is so pissed of alia🤣😂😂 and so me😑😑 she is not letting her complete everytime🙄🙄 yaha debate thodina ho rahi h jo award milega🤭😳😕
Kudos to deepika , tabu and taapsee for tolerating such irritating ladies😂😂😂😂 i mean why they are trying to be the gyaani baba🙄🙄  aalia  tried so hard to look smart and intelligent but sry boss she failed miserably 🤣🤣 and rani and anushka😂😂for not letting them complete 😑
Anushka has everything except brain
Alia looks so jealous of Tapsee 🤣🤣
Rani and Anushka - two really impatient women . They belong to the category of people who  just wait to reply ,and do not actually listen .

There&#39;s a difference in males round table
I am missing katrina KAIF here
Came here only for Ms. Rani Mujherjee! LOVED IT!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3156">52:36</a>... Anushka&#39;s face when Taapsee says she loves all the sports stuff😉
I just watched the actors round table. Clean and being quite when others speak. And here is a chaos. After 4 sentences they get quite and then again became speaking .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3250">54:10</a> accha setting kiya hai😂😂
It&#39;s weird to see Rani, Tabu with Deepika, Anushka and Alia... So annoying 😠... I want to listen Rani and Tabu... Not the others blabbering like millennials.
Taapsee talking about turning down a film at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=467">7:47</a> and going on to do Judwaa 2 which is exactly the kind of film she was talking about is why I have trust issues.
Shouldn&#39;t have bring Alia. She never listen to those senior actress speak  instead she is making her face this that like as if she is getting bored..And  they are wrong what they speak and she is right what&#39;s she speak ....<br>Such a disrespectful actress always show off. She is not the only actress there are thousands of actress more than her but she is too much. I don&#39;t know what she is trying to prove .
Look at men&#39;s round table , these girls don&#39;t speak one by one , Tabu and Rani , with age comes wisdom. Anushka and Alia I say.
Actors round tables are way better than this.. They let others finish their point and also appreciate each others works. These are so annoying and irritating to my ears..
Speak at a one time plzz 😒m scared
When I was watching the male actors round table all the actors were so patient talking and listening as well. They were all speaking one at a time. And here all the ladies are speaking at the same time feels like fish Market.
Rani...Is it necessary to interrupt everyone??like it&#39;s fine that you have your own opinion,but you should also let others talk.
Missing beauty like juhi chawla, shreedevi
Replace Rani with Bhumi
Tabu... so intelligent and articulate
Tabbu ,Taapsee 😘😘😘😘😘😘
Love u sisters
I loved Deepika tabu and tapsee... just louuuuuuuuvvvvveeedddd themmmmm..
Anushka is just interfering in between the conversations and I loved Deepika she&#39;s just a good listener and not talking randomly ..
Nobody spoke about Rani in Mardaani
Even Alia make more sense than Rani.  she couldnt be quiet and when she was doing that martial art steps, I laughed out loud 🤣 appreciate all and their perspective except Rani I hate her interrupting each and everyone every time. I learnt one thing if you speak less you will be appreciated and less judged on what you said.
Which sheila she was talking about?
Gorgeous and real Deepika.. jealous and fake chhhi alia
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=567">9:27</a>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=569">9:29</a> ALIA IS SOOOOO FAKE MANN !!!🙄🙄😳😳😳
I just love tapsee...she is here in bollywood to act, to perform good roles.... She doesn&#39;t wanna do just bullshit glamours roles of so called heroine....and yes that makes her relatable!!! 😍😍😍
All actress are beautiful😍💓 nd everyone views are outstanding
Anushka is beautiful and the kind of place she comes from and all the hardwork she has done to achieve this spot is so inspiring, really love her.
Its a request to add subtitles because it helps in learning new words and also sometimes its so difficult to understand what they had said
Rani was way too loud and spoke too much .. Anushka has very fast way of speaking.. Alia grow up dear... Deepika So calm❤️...Taapsee is a treat to watch anywhere, u r a gem &amp; Tabu .. hatsoff to ur patience level ❤️
Taapsee, Deepika and Tabu were best in the discussion. Calm, Good listeners and yes good speakers too ❤️
Taapsee you rocked
Hichki hichki hichki
Tabu turned me on! That silence...classy!
Well taapsee is showing Alia that she has done the real struggle.
All are commercial actress except tabu
This roundtable dint deserve Taapsee and Anushka Sharma..they are two of the most worthless overhyped so called &quot;Actresses&quot;..
Damn anushka&#39;s ear rings are bigger than my friend circle
Tp❤
Anushka was most genuine about her female crushes Rani,preity,madhuri sridevi.they were even our childhood crushes.and she was anyway good in while conversation.But alia is so fake
Abe yeh Virat ki lugaai itni jaldi jaldi kyu bolti h bey😂😂<br>Having said that i would like to sincerely mention that Tabu is probably one of the best actress in the country today.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3184">53:04</a> such a cutie 😍😍❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2293">38:13</a> the way dp shut down rani Mukherjee 👍👍you said well dp 👏👌👌
Deepika padukone is very intelligent. A good listener, whatever she talks is meaningful, other were also good. But that&#39;s my wish to see dp, pc  kangana maybe but except acting and her movies she will talk about everything to the controversies to the politics and would be grateful of what she is doing and what she has done
Tapsee was buttering Rani?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1815">30:15</a> the way alia looking at tabu
call even south actresses. If you guys also want this then like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2411">40:11</a> has she lost her mind?<br> She means women should change THEMSELVES even when they aren&#39;t wrong? <br>Kudos to DP for handling it well!!
I dont know why Anushka did not recieved filmfare and national award for pari
Oh  my lawd.. Anushka is like bullet train !!
Could we just crop out alia bhatt please .
Thumbnail just for Deepika ♥️and Tabu.
Here&#39;s one thing.<br>Alia got Filmfare award for Raazi🙄 not Deepika 😍for padmavat. <br>Then Alia got Filmfare for gully boy too not kangana for laxmibai.<br>Now am afraid that the incredible performance by Deepika Padukone in Chapakk might lose to another movie by Alia.<br>Nepotism at high level.<br>Bollywood=👎<br>DEEPIKA ♥️.
Deepika = calm , good speaker , good listener , composed , and a person with strong and valid points. Not like dumb Rani.
Deepika 💝💝💝💝
Tabu 💝💝💝💝💝💝
Hugeeeeeeeeee fan of tabu after watching andhadun...hats off
Good speaker order<br>1)Anushka,2)rani 3)alia or tapsi 4)tabu 5)deepika
What is the issue with deepika? She’s constantly frowning I was really distracted all the time by her expressions
Really liked deepika...  She is such a talented actress 🤗...  Tabu have got a patience 🤗🤗
Seriously rani should have been left home. Kangana was requiref
and anushka has talent of speaking fasttt
deepika padukone is the best
Ma anand Sheela wali kab announce hogi  batana please
Deepika Ma&#39;am I am your huge fannnnn!!
Why u dint call Shraddha Kapoor for this interview because she deserves it not Alia bhatt
Anushka 👎🏽
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2768">46:08</a> rani was constantly speaking and Tapsee was trying to speak she should have atleast let her speak and complete what she was saying
Rajeev are you afraid of kangana?
Anushka ko train pakadni ha shayad
Rani is a big liar. What is she saying??? <br>She was a baby when Qawamat se qawamat tak released!!!! Is it possible?? QSQT released in 1988 and Rani ne apna debut kiya in the year 1995 ek bengali movie se. Toh 1988 mein woh baby kaise ho sakte hai?? Public ko aur baki logoko BC ullu samajhti hai kya??!!!! Ridiculous!!!
tabu truly is the finest, senior and most elegant among all these ladies
Tabu and Deepika who knows how to act are active listeners....Anushka is the only who knows least about acting and spoke more..then they write in their insta or Twitter bio ACTOR .I hate her acting...!!
Did Anushka do some surgery?her face looks bizarre.
Tabu, Deepika,tapsee-respectful,good listeners, speaking sense.😊Rani , Anushka,Alia - loud, interrupting others, sometimes saying good things sometimes idiotic.....Rani&quot;s views on metoo#😁😁😁😁😁😁😁.
I want to shout out loud to Rani &quot;SHUT THE F*** UP&quot;
Looks like Rani is on her periods and is having mood swings🤣🤣🤣
Alia is too overrated
Tapsee is so humble, she&#39;s listening to them patiently and not fighting for speaking.
Am i the only one who thinks rani was right..and Deepika was being uneducated about the fact that it&#39;s not possible to change someone&#39;s thought overnight..<br><br>If anybody have seen the Nirbhaya&#39;s victims  he would understand that people are sick and grown ups can&#39;t be changed easily but we can be careful or else lose our daughters while proving that they should change.<br><br>If there&#39;s a mad dog in your street you would wait for it to be removed from there and be careful and not just roam in the streets with a belief that he should understand that biting is wrong<br><br>I think the entire comment section is filled with 🐑
Tabu and Deepika superb!!!! Alia and Deepika and rani always behave oversmart.....
Deepika anushka and tabu are sensible
I hate you Aliya bhatt..
Boring n serious
Anushka is such a chanchadi
Anushka chanchadi
सबका एक साथ बोलना जरूरी है क्या लड़कियों??
I love you. Dipu and Anushka
I&#39;m just wondering when does Anushka drop her new rap single. Definitely needs to make a album.
Tabu is not ready to listen rani haha
AnushkA is always talking fast because itz her nature and habit not in this intview ....love tabu
Wow Rani Mukherjee truly showed herself. You can&#39;t tell about them on screen but take em out of it and they show their true colors.
Rani is trying to cut every woman with her opinions on that table when they&#39;re talking with. She thinks their opinions are way below hers.
Is there any way the video can play without me hearing Rani&#39;s word vomit and interruptions?
I just love Anushka
I am feeling like to blast the table.
Wow. This comment section is the best thing on Earth. XD
rani is so irritating
Mene thumbnail dekha to esa laga alia bhatt bra phenke behti hai 😂
All actresses are talking about all of there experience<br>Rani is all about Hichki
What&#39;s the shade of Tapsee pannu&#39;s lipstick?
Absolutely loved Rani...she is talking maturely and practically that women should take everything into their own hand first and every mother should teach their son to respect women... every change starts at our own home..we can&#39;t always ask others to change.
People viewing this in January, like this!!! wohooooooooooooo, i am so happy.
Love u deepu
Who came here after watching new Episode
It&#39;s like a GD on a topic
They are talking too much
Watched this after 2019 round table, how Deepika replied abt “johar” was so easily accepted looks lopsided argument as compared to Kabir Singh question....
Rani ke saste nashey,,🤣🤣🤣🤣
@Onkar Bande  No product of Nepotism has  KARAN JOHAR, GODFATHER..( of Alia bitch ) Who recommends bhansali &amp; rajamouli to cast her , she&#39;s over rated and Above average actress , watched all her work
One of the worst episodes. No one waited for their turn, it was like a fish market scene. Constantly interrupting each other. Tabu Ma’am was pure grace. Lots of respect. ❤️Well done Deepika and Anushka, Alia for making your point against the privileged Rani Mukherjee. Her views on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23me">#me</a> too are appalling💔she kept on blabbering and wouldn’t let anyone talk. 😡She lost my respect. <br>Alia, Anushka and Rani must learn to speak when you’re spoken to. Tapasee was alright though.<br>Anushka Sharma could’ve mentioned tabu as well when she was going umm umm for female good actress crushes, that was rude af. Tabu is extremely talented and versatile.
Taapsee says c likes to play a flawed character n then c has problems with Kabir singh. What does c really want to follow?
Rani👎👎👎👎👎👎
Deepika  and tabu nailed it.
Rani@book of history so boring 😊
Blablablablah  bhalhblahblahblahblah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!anushkaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!faster than Shoab Akthar.....
Rani being oversmart...sry but no one agreed rani.....whos here after tried and refused..poor aliya tapsee was right...
shallow
Rani Mukherjee sounds obnoxious stupid and lime light grabbing woman... It&#39;s irritating... She&#39;s patriarchal in her opinion which she delusionally thinks feministic.... I lost respect for her... Seriously
Rani bagwan na kare par agar tumhari ladki ka sath aisa kuch hoga toh tabi bhi tum usse he bologe k u should take you responsibility...what a bullshit...ye toh vahi baat hogai vo rapest hai toh vo rape toh karega he tum apni responsibilities kyu nai le rahe ho...rani....chodho jane do
Kangana only could have shut rani &#39;s mouth ...wish she was here
I wish Rani got Hichkis here , so that others got a chance to speak.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Deepika is the most ugly actress in Bollywood..... Jacqueline,sharrdha,Shruti many actress r more beautiful than ugly Deepika...mujhe to Deepika ki shakal dekhte hi ulti hoti h
I totally agree with ranis views of taking responsibility  on your own to defend yourself
Double standard  lizzard  female celebrity  interview
This became annoying pretty soon. Tabu and Deepika behaved like ladies. Rest are just behaving like hens running out of cage.
But rani did make sense
Rani is correct as per her experience &amp; Dipika as per her&#39;s. No one is wrong.
i m missing Kangana
&quot;Sheila ki Jawani&quot;<br>Alia be like &quot;Anushka what&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;
From start to 59.05 mins . The only person I hated was rani mukerji .. god she is so full of herself .. such an irritating person !
The conversation would have been more civil &amp; engaging, had Rani not been there.
Alia is looking gorgeous! ♥️
Feels like Alia is only talking to prove she&#39;s not stupid.
Rani is so irritating to watch throughout. Cutting people off in the middle to complete what they are saying. She mad or what?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3180">53:00</a> discussing n laughing  about they being in school and their first crushes actors are so older than them atleast 15 20 years older and they r like now their costars 😒Rani and Aamir <br>Dp and srk and Alia and srk or Ranbir
Unpopular opinion- Alia Bhat seems to be really intelligent.
I was worried that they will ask that question &quot;how did you feel to work with this or that male  star?&quot; And somehow indirectly it still came. <br>Whereas in actor round talk there was no such questions.<br><br>Its funny how in both talk Rajiv has to point so one one can talk at a time. But for different reasons, in one because noone was talking in other everyone was talking at the same time😂
GD round is going on<br>even the celebs don&#39;t know the rules of Grup discusn IRONIC.🤣
Actors roundable conversation was way better than this shit..so much noise
Tabu was literally sleeping with her eyes open lol 😂😂😂😂
Rani ma&#39;am is so true on strengthening women...
Feels like a recruitment GD process... And tabu didn&#39;t like the profile of the job offered... And Rani was desperate...
Tabu was the only sensible lady present
1st Tabu, 2nd Deepika n lasts r Rani n Alia..
I wonder why is Deepika even sitting there. She has no idea what to say so all she does is give a blank look at whoever speaks. Check her at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=495">8:15</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2367">39:27</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1314">21:54</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1521">25:21</a> Its the same dumb expression. :-)<br>Too bad Ranveer is not there to back her up. &amp; surrounded by actress like Rani &amp; Tapsee, she can&#39;t just get away with showing her teeth &amp; Dimple
Everyone is interrupting one another... It&#39;s a mess... Nobody is finishing their opinion completely
Taapsee would be a good candidate for biopic on Indira Gandhi
Rani Mukherjee 👎👎👎👎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3232">53:52</a><br>Tabu: Kya chyutiya bana rahi hai.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2331">38:51</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2436">40:36</a><br><br><br>The Earth shouldn&#39;t revolve around the Sun. We want the Sun to revolve around the Earth. Deepika and Anushka - Flag-bearers of toxic (brainless) feminism.
Is it true that Ma anand Sheela will be played by alia?
I love Deepika but I hate Anushka..I think she mad to talk..how Koli tolerated her..ohh my god..
Sab ek dusre ki bate kat rhi ,........i start to laugh...This is difference between man and women
Koi ek bolo be sabhi ek saath bolne shuru karke fishmarket me aa Gaye lag Raha hai.Thoko bhencho taali
He looks like rabbit.........
Tabu madam sitting and thinking when will this  end !
Reading a lot of these comments, obviously many about rani, but even about anushka and alia....... Bro these are the men(and a lot of women but ive seen more of men here) who call women who have something to say(not including rani because she really had a single minded view and very...... Un-understanding) calling such intelligent and opinionated women &quot;bossy&quot; or &quot;chatty&quot; and its funny that you call someone fake with really no basis of what real is lol because you don&#39;t know who she is behind the screens and behind the cameras. Maybe alia is naturally bubbly and &quot;baby-like&quot; and maybe anushka is very outgoing or &quot;chatty&quot; if she has something to say. But apparently like most Indian men, like most men in general lol women with voices and opinions will not be respected but cause discomfort in these people.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And hence the irony of what anushka was saying at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2580">43:00</a> that your voices your opinions and your beliefs become a thing of annoyance to men. Just like these comments reflect.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1737">28:57</a> Ganda wala intereption
Jaha pe tabu ko bolna waha pe bi anshuka bol rahi h
Anushka:The way I was 10years ago I&#39;m exactly the same way now...<br>Me:No ... you&#39;ve done yourself a lipjob
Wish Ratna Pathak Shah had been a part of this discussion to hear Rani&#39;s vomit. Rani would&#39;ve definitely been schooled by her.
Rani talking was a cringe fest. <br>For the love of God, woman, keep your regressive thoughts to yourself and never participate in a discussion on a subject as sensitive as this one, ever.
This video has more ads than a classified section in a newspaper 🙄🤷
Alia is adjusting her dress the entire time 😏
Alia is so white that I can&#39;t even see her nose definition at all😂😂😂
rani ka kya bullshit hai
Love you Deepika , so graceful.
Rani irritated me so much.
I was so pissed with rani and the fact that nobody ever touched the food on the table.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3323">55:23</a> Rajeev be like omg all r dumb
Alia has the biggest ego, arrogance and impatience inherited by her gay daddy ,the god of nepotism Karan Johar. Giving countless opportunities to bitch alia is lame as hell. There&#39;s a whole world out there far better than these people. It&#39;s a buck corruption of commercial light and overwhelming love by fools. Tabu is the coolest as she chose silence and calm way of conveyance. Lol Anushka is childish but adorable and her words run faster than the speed of trickling lol. Rani is an aunty arrogant ....
Everything that&#39;s coming out of rani&#39;s mouth is just cringe fest. I physically winced once or twice. She is so ignorant about so many things and she&#39;s still speaking as if she has the knowledge of the world
Everyone is just going on and on. No one really gives a shit what the other is saying. Everyone on the table just wants to get heard. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hearmetoo">#hearmetoo</a>
Sach bolu to sabse shi mujhe Round table with Newcomers laga becaz usme sab ek doosre ko bolne de rhe the, there was no jealousy and they all was very Comfort with each other
Come on girls... You should have seen the round table of heroes so that you could learn to wait till the next one completes her part😛..... Hats off to tabbu mam👏🎩
deepika is best
Also Rani played the main lead in that movie where <b>justice</b> to rape victim is getting married to the rapist! DAH!
Rani is so annoying.
I don&#39;t think Rajeev masand will  do female roundtable afterthat
Rani is so irritating here acting like she has achieved a milestone<br>Aunty
So much insecurities on one table.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3411">56:51</a> Alia...
As rani is married.....<br>Matured<br>.....may b for this.....<br>But....esa nhi ki wo galat or wahiyat he....
It wasn’t a roundtable interview, it was catfight coldwar and Tabu just dont want to participate in this coldwar and Rani is just behaving like Auntie who was long forgotten and now cameback to a kittyparty after a long a time and now she wants all the attention.
Rani = victim labelling
The one who is supremely versatile and a killer actress (tabu) is actually not saying much while others are blabbering like they are PhD in acting course, Empty vessel sounds much proved to be true.
Oh my god... Anushka ur genius how naturally u spoke with crystal clear views...ur language knowledge hats off...and Deepika wt is the listening capacity u have and ur talking whenever needed, Taapsee intelligence is osm... alia ur cute intelligence is superb... specially Anushka Sharma confidence and million dollars smile is enough to watch it...if Virat is run machine then Anushka is word machine
when was this?
Y everyone listining rani bcz she is now belongs to yrf head after married aditya chopra ,yeh director producers k samne kam baat karte hai bcz kahin koi prob na ho jaye but i love anushka and,deepika how they cut her on her wrong words on mee too question that woman have to learn marchal art etc ,and i want to ask which aloa said kuch gande log 1,1,2,2 saal k chote bacho se bhi rape karte hai,jo ki aaye din news main rehta hai,ek 9 month tak k bache se uske grandfather ne rape kiya tha woh kya karen bache? Like rani also have adhira kehna nahi chahiye par agar unki beti k saath aisa ho to woh kya kahegi?marchal art nahi seekhaya  maine meri beti ko to rape ho gaya ,ya usne us situation ko handal karna nahi aaya to rape ho gaya,ya phir kahegi ki maine apni beti ko yeh nhi sikhaya ki kich him inbetween legs?itna chota bacha kya karega,shame on  you rani ,and deepika,anushka,alia have right point of veiw and they know how to talk on this serious issue,hats off to them ,and shame on rani
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2467">41:07</a> that pause before she completed the sentence means she is making something up to stay relevant with the topic.
Deepika thinks too deeply to say some extremely regular stuff.
Deepika and her diplomatic answers, which make no sense
Rani is so annoying.
tabbu jab v baat kr rhi h uski last line you know har bat k bad u know
Rani started off good.. 😮
Rani is a comedian in real life😂
Rani didn&#39;t used her sexuality like these other shameless actresses i guess from the conversation and didn&#39;t go for small roles with big stars like all these other hypocrite actresses thats why she is getting the wrong comments.
Tabu Rocks she&#39;s really wise and intelligent😍😘
Rani mukherjee is dumb<br>😂😂
yaar what rani mikherjee said was just like victim blaming
I watched this for tabu and she was the most silent one 😐😐
Rani is fucking weird . God Adi Chopra teach her some manners. Shit I never saw this. She just can&#39;t stop. Dude. Interrupting again and again.
So much uneaten food.. :(
This could have been a much more mature conversation if they let each other finish first rather than throwing their opinions just like that.. these are the etiquettes..deepika and tabu stood out for me
Rani has to put her nose in every line 😂
Among all of these...Naturality comes from Anushka 🙌
Plz let one complete its part then talk ladies..
Deepika is so boring. She takes a lot of time to think while speaking til then one can even have a little nice nap.
Relation between alia anushka and deepika is so complicated...<br>Supossing katrina is here
I have seen these group discussion in college 😂😂😂
Deepika is so SENSIBLE &amp; GRACIOUS😍❤
We want Kangana next time !
Interrupting each other...😕
Mulk and manmarziya both films were flops ... Anushka&#39;s all 3 films were flops.... Hichki was also flop...
anushka my fav
anushka looking awsm
rani🙄
I feel the same for Deepika, as she felt for Princess Diana. 🌹
<b>PLEASE BRING KANGANA WITH THESE ACTRESSES IN ROUNDTABLE... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! IT&#39;LL BE GREAT!</b>
If they invited actress then where is kangana.... Actually we know Bollywood because of kangana
Rani was behaving like Aamir..
Rani was trying to correct everyone and suggesting them English words...
Why is Anushka speaking at 2X playback speed 😂😂
All the actresses had an opinion and were great at it, except Rani talking about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#MeToo</a> movement!
What Rani is saying is actually against the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#MeToo</a> movement! If you have to learn to defend yourself right outta your mother&#39;s womb, and that too by learning &quot;Martial arts&quot;, then it&#39;s better to be a victim of female foeticide itself!  You cannot say that a 5 year old girl child should know to defend herself against her uncle or her school security guard, because in a case like that, it&#39;s a failure of our society! I don&#39;t think anyone was ever scared of Rani for how she looks or her voice, but she&#39;s just been lucky nothing like this happened with her! And you can defend yourself against one or two men, but what about a group bigger than that? What about a herd of dirty men who unite for such a cause?
Bas karo yaar...jahan ladies aa gayi wahan har baar women empowerment ka baat karna jaruri hai kya..<br>yeah i get it and most of the indians also.<br>Plz bas karo har discussion me women empowerment ko lana.<br>Jabardasti ka hot topic mat banao...especially to rani mukherjee
Who feels rani mukharji is irritating..?
DP n TABU <br>Besst
They are stars not actors except two
What Rani said about the Me Too movement was terrible. Yes, women should feel empowered, but more importantly men should be held accountable for their actions. Women also are never taught not to sexually harass others but the majority of the cases involve a man harassing women. If a man is forcing himself on a woman, it&#39;s not as simple as slapping them or kicking them. That action can cost a woman her life. Think before you speak, it is not as easy as saying no, unfortunately
Tabu❤
I want to eat nachos on the table
kangana hoti toh inmai se koi ni bolti <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23westandwithkangana">#westandwithkangana</a> ❤️❤️❤️
I never thought Rani Mukherjee is this much idiotic.
Really all are unbeatable <br>Superb ,woman power great .
Deepika,Tabbu and Tapsee are so talented as well as beautiful 😍
When these ladiesl speak without any script..they sounds complete bullshit n foolish..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2310">38:30</a> i agree with Deepika and Anushka . what is Rani saying
What a stupid answer on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> question by Rani..!!  She is really irritating..!!  Instead of her kangana or radhika apte should be there!! The girls who made their own!!
I saw the male actors episode and I must say the questions asked to women are literally lame compared to men... On one side you are celebrating women empowerment and other side you don&#39;t even have good questions or technicalities to talk about... It&#39;s important to discuss how a male actor prepares for his roles but not important to ask something like that to a female actor.
Tabu is like so senior she should be with better actors
There is a one thing make this discussion different than the actors round table
We really missed Radhika apte
Seriously, what bs is Rani blabbering!?
Ignore problems like everybody&#39;s ignoring Alia😂
I want to slap rani😡😡😡...she is very much annoying
Whats wrong with rani, i think she is sitting in kitty party
&quot;Aurat hi aurat ki sabse badi Dushman hai&quot; I always felt the idiom was too sexist. But after watching Rani Mukherjee speak on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> I truly understand what it means.
You can clearly see the difference between men&#39;s and women&#39;s round table 😂😂
is taapsee pannu talking about badhaii ho
Tabu tell them which road u walking I am one who created it.she is powerhouse of acting
Omg..!! Rani is completely annoying yaar..!! I mean wtf martial arts 🙄😒 whenever she starts talking I felt so bored she&#39;s like aunty whom we want to avoid so badly nd when she started talking about her film she&#39;s saying about having baby pregnancy etc omg is that necessary such a time waste.🤦🤦🤦<br>Hats off to tabu for her patience.. Deepika is Elegant .. mature ❤️<br>Tapsee is so talented 😊
Jab koi ni sunn rahaa toh Rani Rajeev ko pakad rahi h😆🤣
Rani😁😆🤣🤣
Actor&#39;s roundtable was so great!Here it feels people are trying to talk over each other
as usual ladkia...<br>koi kisiko bolne nahi de rahi hai..
Hmmm Alia ghutt is so annoying. She thinks she knows everything and talking over every one there. The don’t let each other Finish the sentences that’s just dumb
Rani must do her own interview in her imaginary universe and leave the real world to normal people. &quot;Women must change so men don&#39;t harass them&quot;. Wtf is she thinking
What the hell tapasee is doing here?  God too much attitude she has. And why is Rani wearing that eww type yellow shade in the interview?
Rani should have left the glasses at home.  Ugh !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1105">18:25</a><br><br>Taapsee: Your turn T-A-B.<br>Me: Well played, T-A-A.<br><br>😂😂😂
Why swara bhaskar isn&#39;t here?
Never ever call Anushka aunty.....the idiot blabbering queen...
ALL I HEAR IS &quot;blah bla blah&quot;
Why I think that male actors&#39; roundtanble was so chilled out and good than this one
Wow 😮 so sweet of my best female Indian actress deepika padukone she is very calm and I found her interested
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23anuskha">#Anuskha</a> Sharma reminds me of my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ex">#Ex</a>-girlfriend
Deepika is not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fun">#Fun</a> just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23serious">#Serious</a> ✋
Deepika is not as much as I thought <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sorry">#SORRY</a>
Dont wanna comment about rani so lets talk about anushka, her eye make up is really nic😍🤩
I think rani is going to join politics
Not a fan of Deepika, but this video only got a like because of her as she made sense and wasn&#39;t talking like she&#39;s read too many intelligent (seeming) interviews and wanted to repeat those words.
I think that there ja many i think than other talks...just i think
Rani 🤙🏿
Why is Acting so much hyped for people to make believe as it is supernatural. After all, its something one does, like other job requiers different ingredients. I believe this shouldnot be made over the top, should be talked in simple, fun way rather than defending the acting to be such a magic trick to perform and all.
Not one of you is a serious actor.
Alia what&#39;re you doing here????? 😅😂😅
In a nutshell..all of them speak fucked up english
Every member here is example for every simple thing for do&#39;s and dont&#39;s in a group discussion <br><br>All the Grads just learn. It might be useful
Mother teresa ? WTF!!
Is that anushka or eminem ?
Negativity si dikh rhi h yr sach mein inme.males ki khasiyat hoti h jalte nhi h agr  male actors hote na toh maza ata
Bhai glass me kya hai?
Taapsi is my fav.
Rani tabu
Why is Rani repeating words like some dadi amma😂😂😂😂
Tapsee is a very intelligent and fun loving soul❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Too much advertisement # irritated
Anushka talks sooooooo much !!! She needs to listen too. She needs to let others talk 😪
I don&#39;t know why the hell does Rani act like a gyani aunty here, he has done just one film in 2 years and keeps on singing songs about the film and her daughter though nobody saw her film, its ok you did a film and you got a baby now sit back and let the other people talk as well. Stop being the snooty aunty we hate listening at family gatherings.<br>Though on the other hand Deepika and Tabu shows the class and depth of a good actor in them.
I have a huge crush on Tabu and Taapsee...
Tabu and deepika utilize their maturity in a good way
Rani says mothers have to teach their sons. Why Rani?  Fathers have no responsibility? Rani has security running behind her so I am sure she never had to use her mediocre martial art skills on any psychos
Okay so Alia acted to be dumb in other earlier interviews😊
I am scared for Adhira
Tabu is a brilliant actor
Deepika is so graceful
Very aggressive women
Why do i feel, Rani&#39;s tone and remarks are so patronizing in this! i was searching to see my most humble and  brilliant queen throughout the interview to no avail. Anyhow, thank you for the upload.
It was barely a conversation  they kept interrupting each others. Monologues more than anything else. Shout out to Tabu and Deepika, they were gracious and well behaved. You can feel they really came to have a conversation<br>Edit : not even talking about Rani&#39;s bs on the metoo movement and how women are responsible in a way... I dislike her so much right now. Disgusting
Rani said it right, protect yourself, woman or man. To change this world and society into a perfect place will take forever even if it will ever change at all. Protect yourself, Say No, and correct be responsible for your life and your destiny in the best possible way you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ranimukerji">#ranimukerji</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a>
omg what happen to them they totaly forgot they are in interview,rani omg what happend to you,alia trying acting as a cute, anushka rapping,both three don&#39;t let others to talk ,only deepu and tabbu the best,i think deepika was saying oh god let it end,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3411">56:51</a> alia and anushka its weird, except deepika and tabbu and taapsee alittle, rani,alia and anushka are sorry to say that but immature,arrogant  and egocentric
deepu and tabu are best
only deepika intellegent
deepika is the best
Hahahahaha ek duSre ko baat nhi krne nhi dethe
Rajeev moto.... like ...ary kis kis ke sunu....when they were talking about, metoo...ka chutiyapa..and ....rani irritated so much
Tapsee is so humble she appreciates everybody work of frame
I am so glad Sonam wasn&#39;t here . . .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2119">35:19</a> Deepika&#39;s reaction when rajeev took Ranveer Singh&#39;s name!
Alia(Raazi)😘<br>Tapsee😘 looking very beautiful <br>Tabu😘
Tapsee is best
Tapsee is best
Looks like a bunch of girls fighting during a campus placement gd! 😆😆
Agar yaha Katrina ko invite kiya hota toh 1 million views down aa ja te

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=866">14:26</a> Rani is the real moderator
Rani’s is mentality is uglier than her voice! I am so glad I never liked her! I hate her actually. She is a big hypocrite &amp; she is not at all innocent that she pretends to be, she is the opposite of that! I wish everyone sees her real ugly soul one day. She had an abortion in her 10th standard!
Rani is talking nonsense <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2550">42:30</a>
I am the fan of Alia
Rani shows similar age with others without tabbu
Deepika and anushka definitely understand. Rani is probably the most stupid person that I’ve come across
Rani spoke the most bullshit that I’ve ever heard from anybody. There are so many women that are afraid and threatened when they are harassed or abused. It’s easy for stupid rani to simply say that the women should say “back off” but in reality you don’t know what women go through and how hard it can be. It’s not that easy. She has really shown the type of person that she is and what she thinks in her mind. Bollywood is dangerous having women thinking the way that she does.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2416">40:16</a> it&#39;s not just a woman&#39;s responsibility to raise her son ,It&#39;s just as much the father&#39;s fault. Infact , Research shows that a rapist father , Especially those who get away with it ,Raise a rapist son. The rape culture starts with the father praising his son for &quot;becoming a man&quot;. Most mothers wouldn&#39;t want their son to be a rapist
80% of the comments dissing rani
tapsee, tabu and deepika were really intelligent people, dude
Actress means acting not fake beauty<br>Madhubala Ji<br>Wahida Ji<br>Rekha Ji<br>Jaya Ji <br>Hema Ji<br>Madhuri Ji<br>Ye Hai actress
Tabbu and rani ko chod SAB bakwas
2 min of silence for Rani Mukerji.. Kaha ka maal phunk ke ayi ho behenji 🤣😂🤣😂
Ladies and gentle men presenting to u lying bitches of all times....
I think they need to understand the importance of letting each other speak and not interrupt in between. Tabu was sober in this case but the other ladies really need to stop this behaviour. I respect all of them and I love their work, but this behaviour is so off track.
The audio of my laptop wasn&#39;t working while watching it. And, I enjoyed this video.
what happened to all the food? Did they take those home? or did they eat those behind camera? Men wouldn&#39;t have done that. :D
Deepika Padukone biggest fakester on earth.
In actors roundtable the &quot;actual actors&quot;,can learn alot
Aakshi Arora i don’t understand that what is this as such which she spoke n everyone is offended can someone elaborate
Kangana should have been there instead of this irritating rani..I am pretty sure kangana would have shut everyone&#39;s mouth by her sensible talk🤔🤔🤔
Why did Tabu even agree to sit with these women who just became actresses on nepotism and on no talent.
So is it okay for women who have not learned martial arts to get raped? Women who are disabled, who are in a coma, or just in general physically weaker than the other person? Why is the responsibility always shifted to the victims instead of the perpetrators?<br>Also, Rani says, &quot;it&#39;s the mothers who are raising these men who become rapists&quot; (paraphrasing),  so the father is not supposed to have any role and responsibility towards his child? Matlab ghoom firke it&#39;s a woman&#39;s fault or &quot;she could have done something&quot;. Read: Just world Hypothesis and victim blaming.
It’s not about arguing they’re just having a friendly debate ! They’re just being themselves ! There ain’t no need to judge them ! They’re talking so candidly ! Some are quiet by nature while some want to express themselves ! Nice interview !
Anushka 😍😍😍most sensible
Tabu didn&#39;t deserve to be among these shitty actresses.
What rani said is right. You can only control yourself. You can only be responsible with your actions. We can&#39;t control other people. Sorry to say that Indian ladies need to change the old age cultured perspectives. I am thankful I was not born  in India. My Indian father has brought up all his daughters to have their own mind and speak out. Parents need to bring up the sons and daughters the same way.<br><br>Just because you are new in an acting industry doesn&#39;t mean you have to allow anyone take advantage of you. You allow it because you want to get a break into the industry. If you have dignity and your self worth is more important than your ambition... You would walk out. Not allow to be taken advantage of and then complain. Grow some balls (for men) and boobs (for women).
I am surprised how much Rani and Anushka can talk... Kudos to Tabu,  Deepika and Tapsee for tolerating these self proclaimed Actresses&#39;s nonsense talking... 🤓🤓🤓
ek hi baaat kitne baar ghuma k bolengey
I wish Kangna is here to show them what real intellect talk is.... these girls need to learn let other speak .Rani so irritating
deepika is really a active listener........i just love DEEPIKA........<br>BIG FAN OF HERS..............
Why is Anushka there. She didn&#39;t even gave a single hit.<br>Pari - Flop<br>Sui Dhaga - Flop<br>Zero - Flop<br>Instead Neena Gupta deserves to sit there
Alia Bhatt looks like a teenager. All the other actresses look like mature older women !
Rani os looking cheeeeeeeeeeeee
Deepika was totally dissatisfied on what rani was speaking🤣🤣
Tabu&#39;s face <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2957">49:17</a>. i cant
Rajiv i hope you are a better moderator after this.
Tabu and Deepika real queens,Alia and Rani talk too much
Love for tabu
You know this comment section makes me so happy that so many people especially men are supporting women in this fight against sexism and harrasment and i can say that India is waking up. We as indians need   to stand together against such injustices that have been happening since years. Proud to be Indian. Jai hind.
Like the video for Deepika, Tabu and Taapsee... And soooo much of interruption by Alia, Anushka and my god Rani... 😅
Rani being a new mother.... to a DAUGHTER.... she being realistic is really very normal..... she isn’t saying this will keep on happening, she’s saying this is happening... we should do something to stop it! 😶😶😶
comment section is a proof of whats wrong with current youth, instead of being right, doing the right thing, and support solutions, some of them only want to play the victim card and cry.
Tapsee - I’ve never watched any of her movies but oh my, this girl is PHENOMENAL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2340">39:00</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2400">40:00</a> : Deepika does not understand natural instinct of attach-defense-survival.
Rani Mukherjee is more intelligent than others.
My ears are bleeding :(
omg taapsee pannu is such a brilliant personality,
Why isn&#39;t Kangana here?
You missed out Kangana..one of the most brave, honest, intelligent nd a great actress..
Rani.. 🙌🙌🙌🙌<br>Tabu.. 😍😍😇😇🙌🙌<br><br>I&#39;ll never understand how can someone admire Deepika&#39;s and Anushka&#39;s mediocrity. Oh wait.. I actually do. They&#39;re mediocre themselves to form an opinion of their own. 😂😂😂
Why the hell are all these women talking over each other?? Just let the other person finish first and then say your bit. Also Rani sounds like such a judgemental aunty. I was just watching the Men&#39;s Round table from the past 3 years, and they all waited patiently for the other person to finish, then said their bit and calmly agreed or disagreed by bringing forward their point of view. These ladies have a lot to learn from those male actors. I couldn&#39;t watch more than 9 mins of this video.
Where is Priyanka Chopra??
Anushka and Rani Shouldn’t have been there!
Newcomers roundtable i.e.jahnvi ,sara ,zoya,radhika,ishan, were more fun to watch than these actresses except dp and tabu all were seem to be insensible there were more genuine talks and sensible talks in the newcomers rountable I get so bored watching it that comment section was more fun to read there are so much impatient ladies in this table atleast they should learn some patients from newcomers
I liked Alia&#39;s speech about her movie raazi.
Why everybody is scolding rani? She has done so many good films, i.e black, no one kill jessica, talaash, hichki, and even more.
Am I the only one who else skipped when Rani started speaking
Rani was just like a so unessarry talkative aunti
Koi jakar rani ko thappad maar sakta hai...😡😡😡
The moment Anushka opens her mouth she sounds so senseless...
You don&#39;t have write to about any of the actress bcz all are superb. Go back to ur works
Rani is that annoying aunty
What is Rani doing here? Where&#39;s Kangana or Vidya?<br>Look at Tabu..I adore that girl, such poise
Lmaoo.. Rani gets social climber brag rights. But stop annoying everyone and go back to being the housewife.
liked the video bcoz of deepika
Not a fan of deepika... but she’s the only polite one here!<br>And Rani please, the way she was going on about, having a child &amp; her experience going back to work... like wtf! She literally took over couple of minutes of everyone’s precious time! Everyone else was literally fighting a yawn...
Anushka gives me anxiety... she should work on her speech.. or she should talk slowly so she won’t stammer
Living in a cave with a primate like Aditya Chopra has made Rani lose all her brain cells... sad!
Rani is just there to annoy , to interrupt while others are talking and also just to provide words when any of them stuck while saying something.
I don’t think women centric movies are a new thing. Like every thing else, there is a wave. It comes and goes....Actresses like Nutan &amp; Meena Kumari have carried entire movies in several genres. Our cinema and acting styles have evolved but this isn’t the first time filmmakers are making movies with female protagonists. Tabu herself managed to pull off Astitva in the Saas-bahu-soap-opera phase.
Rani is just ruining this whole session of conversation ! And her voice is so irritating and disturbing...she isn&#39;t letting anyone speak properly....interrupting the others. And the worst thing is that she is continuously saying &quot;ya&quot; &quot;ya&quot; unnecessarily ! 😖😖😖😖<br>Deepika is the heart of this whole conversation ! ❤
Rani,married to Aditya Chopra doesnt mean u host this show.
Tabu is still a living goddess.A living Scorpion
Kangana,tabu and deepika could have been a better combination.I started watching this video and widin 30 secs i came up to see the comments as the the irritating Rani Alia and Anushka were trying to be so cool and in the know of present affairs.U guys are actresses for gods sake.Such a boring and wasteful 30 secs they were.
Rani is the self claimed principal....hahahahah
So boring this interview ...uff
I liked deepika others are talking like robots
Why are they all talking over each other geez!!!
Deepika Padukone is best love her
Lots and lots of interferes..😑 Tabu speak sense amongst all of them..and Deepika will be the second. But i really like the way Tapsee speaking. Clear and comfortable to understand
I don&#39;t wanna sound anti-feminist, but compare the manners of actors and actresses round table. Rajeev Masand is a real champ dealing with their naive behavior of cutting each others talk, thanks to Alia bhat...
What did Rajeev say when Alia said she wants to play the role of Sheela and then she goes like &quot;Ahaa? But as you said I would kill to play that role.&quot; ? I didn&#39;t get that?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3244">54:04</a> alia talking about ranbir ❤️ thank me for saving ur time 😋
Where is the most talented kangna.?I wish kangna on this table so the chatt could become  more inresting to listen.
Which movie was Tapsee talking about when she said that there was a hit movie during the year in which the actress didn&#39;t have much to do ?
The transition between each speaker was a little awkward here as it was like who&#39;s turn it is , it could be more natural
Never expected this from Rani Mukherjee 🤦🏻‍♀️ but Deepika is so gracious and intelligent
Deepika (some people find her inarticulate but forget the exact words, I find her thinking very straightforward, clear and honest) and Tabu were so poised and patient, quietly putting in their important two cents to the conversation when needed, while Anusha, Alia and Tapsee, especially Anushka, put forth their views with a lot of zest (and some interruptions too) which were equally well put (especially appreciate Anushka sharing her family&#39;s tale). I do think Rani started out fine at the beginning of the conversation but the statement that you can&#39;t ask &#39;a hundred mothers&#39; to parent their sons and daughters better but can ask women to learn self-defence is not just logically flawed but, as rightly pointed out by Deepika and Anushka, puts the onus, once again, on the women and men who have suffered.<br>We have a responsibility to ourselves and our fellow women and men to be strong, but society owes us some safety and respect as well.
Alia is so feared of having an opinion<br>LOLWA
Rani is here because of her HUSBAND
Anushka <br>I love you for PHILAURI❤️😘😍
Alia must have rehearsed 5000 times because she is TOO DUMB to even have an opinion
Raazi is soooooooooooooooo OVERRATED
How come kangana is not here?????<br>BECAUSE <br>The industry favours butt kissers
I came here after I saw rani blabbering and others getting bored of it
Call priyanka Chopra and the conversation will reach its zenith
Amushka nailed it... Deppika wasted it but she was looking good
Look at Deepika&#39;s expression 😅
Mardaani character made Rani mardaani!
Its not someone who is quite is best out there or intelligenz,smart,elegant etc.but it shows deepika,tabu and even tapsee were listening and reacting with right form of reaction..OMG wats wrong with anushka... is kind of all her impulse anxiety hormone jumping &amp; wanna make it.. she was same like in koffee with karan too... i first,mai pehle number pe aungi..
I loved that Rani Anushka and Alia at least tried to answer all the questions. It would have been better if Tapsee and Tabbu would also take part in the discussion equally. Well we might consider them as good listeners as well as the others are good speakers. 👍
Anushka speaks to kuch that’s her nature she is very straightforward. Rem she also suffer from social anxiety. Alia is getting mature by the day . Tapsee is learning she will be a great actress in the future . Deepika a class apart when she was speaking about Padmaavat u can see that in her eyes she felt the character . One of the best thing to happen to Bollywood is Deepika Padukone . Rani Mukherjee she lost my respect I thought she was a mature lady but she is a women with no mind she is always about herself no body can say anything to her as she is the wife of Adi Chopra the biggest production house of India . Rani women with high attitude with no mind . Tabu is like what am I doing her . She speaks sense whenever she speaks. A lady with class and mind . These women need to learn one thing they need to respect the speaker . Indian mind is ages behind change is required . But it was great watching this .
Okay..! First of all rani is too serious while talking...but at some point rani spoke smartly .....secondly alia have excellent talking sense .....she is too mature..... Deepika is good listener..... And anushka was like she is feel... uncomfortable to speak English.....and all the actress  are ignoring tapsee..idk why? Fun table round 😘
Are hindi me baat kar!
This ladies are on picnic....🙄
who was looking at those gulab jamuns..😜😜😜😜
OMG Rani please 🤦
Deepika is the best
Mean Girls and Shady Queens : Alia vs Taapsee  and Rani vs Tabu
Who came here to watch Rani&#39;s rant ✋?
I wish Kangana on there.... Waat laga deta bhai .... 😁
Rani&#39;s disconnect with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#Metoo</a> movement and toxic masculinity is so irritating to all millenials and gen Z. Deepika, Alia and Anushka really had a look on their face that was reflective of all of us watching. Rajeev Masand and Aditya Chopra please explain this to her the best way she can understand.
Alia: I think its always been that way. For the only one who had 7 out of her first 9 films made by Dharma and has had that envelope of Karan Johar&#39;s production doesn&#39;t realize that before she arrived in 2012 its never been that way up until recently. Born on third base scores a home run syndrome.
plz bring katrina for round table conference her interviews r much appreciated
rani shut up let the others speak
I liked how people in comment section so wanted kangana to be there! Thats the charm of kangana ranaut!❤
Moral of the story: don&#39;t take these ladies too seriously. They&#39;re just actresses. The media and audiences give them too much importance. Listen to women like Michelle Obama if you want to watch a serious conversation.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2380">39:40</a> Now what was that, please?  🤣🤣🤣
Did Rani borrowed glasses from Shakti Kapoor?
Why not Radhika Apte
rani was the best
damn all i am wishing is i could be on that table instead of him
tapsee pannu😍😍
Who feels Kagna should have been part of this discussion?
Good interview 👍🏻🌹🌹
Ohh my most sweet Rani mukharji....love rani plz do some good film we r waiting for u Crome back..❤️❤️❤️❤️🌺🌺🌺🌺
Deepika most beautiful next anushka
alia &amp; tabu has the true perspective of an human or actor,rest of them like Rani~ so RIGID,deep &amp; tapsi ~reacting faster than normal, anushka ~ little late to react
I don’t know why people here are backlashing Rani. Her opinion on upbringing is relevant and has some point. Girls need to be empowered and raised in a way they feel they are no less than boys. Maybe not so much in urban communities but people from rural area, girls are very vulnerable and are not as confident or profound in standing up for themselves.<br>When she said mom’s are to be blamed for raising boy’s behind violating women. As the host said it’s a good introspective to think how the mom could have been raising the boys wrong. Mom’s who don’t set out discipline or values within their sons obviously the son will know no boundaries in his actions even if its to rape a girl. Therefore, it’s the way of upbringing by the mom that plays out significant role. <br>At the end of the day, its her opinion. People are entitled to their’s, you can either agree or disagree but derogating her character and questioning her credibility doesn’t make you a better person. Challenge ideas not people.
Anuskha was like she was in college and. Rajeev was professor ! Not offensive just for fun. I like so much <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23anushka">#anushka</a>
KUWTK is so better than this
RAANI YOU SHOULD TRY TO COME TO A CONCLUSION IN A DEBATE NOT TRY TO WIN IT FORCEFULLY WHEN U KNOW YOU&#39;RE WRONG <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23no">#NO</a>_OFFENCE
I just felt like stopping to watch the video after Rani spoke about women being a problem within themselves and thought of posting a comment but tge comments were already there. Why does she try to speak and be center of attraction in every edgy conversation.
Why is Rani cutting off everyone so much?
Rani was so irritating
I was so distracted by Anushka&#39;s earrings .. I was busy trying to figure out  where the clasp  is!!!
can rani stop interrupting when others are speaking?!<br><br>Edit: did rani just say &quot;if the women don&#39;t want it to happen, this won&#39;t happen&quot; for thr <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> movement. And this is coming from a person who has done &#39;Mardaani&#39; God, I lost all my respect for her.
Rani said the guy who has opinion or doesnt agree with women, that guy has something wrong with his brain. Thats what, there shoudnt be any hate guys. U respect people with money and people with status in ur industry even if that guy has any diff opinion or says filthy things in a casual comic way. I think alia is much, much more matured and has a better understanding of things. Thank you
There is a wide world out there where women reveals their private parts on social media. Adult sites, where it feels like these are things very common, harrassing, touchig women without their consent and somewhat in the movies too we show some. The thing we men arent that bad. It shoudnt be like, women must hate men. Rather teach them a right way. If a boy touches a girl in the streets (underage boy) the girls slaps him, insults, shouts at him beats him in public (saw that video on youtube) . You cant be violent like this on any kid. Yes if a girl child gets raped, its a hideous crime, that person should be killed rght away i say. But every person isnt a rapist that you must comprehend. <br>There are a group of women who will value thier morals and some are there who dont. So there is a huge gap of ideas and beliefs between you women. If you can try to change that, do. I dont think its that possible, because we are all different and want different things from out own life isnt it. I think married men can have sexual pleasures but what about men who are into thinking that they&#39;ll get it one day or they might try to grab it hard. So make sure, subjects and practices like masturbation, or going to brothels is legal and fine and normal. Our government have issues with brothels and stuff also. Arey we are sexual beings ya. U cannot just stop that thing just like that. If u really wana change. Try spreading awarness rather making it a men sort or women sort of thing. Categorisation is lethal for everyone i feel. Thank you.
I think we should be respecting rani&#39;s opinions on whatever she said about women learning self defence,she was honest and her comments made sense,just for few seconds think that all the other actresses were saying that women should not go through the harassment in first place but is it possible in this world just saying that, things should change will not make any difference so its logical of rani to say that women should learn self defence and should know how to protect their own selfs ....people have just misunderstood rani&#39;s comment and are bashing her
Taapse pannu is thinking that she became the top actress of bollywood
Why is Rani wearing those shades?  🤔
I really didn&#39;t enjoy this in round table. Everyone&#39;s trying to show off.
I appreciate Anushka&#39;s support for Deepika&#39;s take on me too movement. She kind of defended Deepika and confronted Rani
They just find a way to talk about their success stories whether it answers the question or not
Deepika 😍😍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2237">37:17</a>  🚫
Rani was drunk easily
The more I see this roundtable interview,the more I hate Rani.... she&#39;s behaving insane!
Deepika u have a great character.
Too much noises and unable to listen and the question was different but girls was saying something else’s.... but I should say Kangana ranaut should be here
Rani ko lana ISS show mein sabse badi galti thi
I felt like I was in Howrah Railway Station...too noisy and chaotic...
There’s no such thing as “UNCERTAINATY” the word is “uncertain” get a dictionary , Deepika
Tapsee and deepika is loving lady .and good listener 😊😊😊
Omg Anushkaa💕💕💕 lovee!!
Why did not anushka reacted the way she blasted the guy who littered when Rani was puking garbage. Why did not deepika lambasted the way she did in toi controversy on face of Rani.Double standards much. All these Bollywood celebs are hypocrites react only after knowing a person&#39;s influence. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shame">#shame</a>
Anushka got so scared that the others will not let her speak that she spoke at the speed of 150 km per hour! I only watched this for Tabu and she was the most silent one!
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2760">46:00</a>,  i was like &quot;abey usko toh bolne di jiski film hai<br>&quot;.
Plz let speak tabu
2019 we need to see kangana , priyanka , katrina at this round table, feel like they are intelligent and strong opionated women. India should be really proud of these women instead of giving them unnecessary hate
Its been 10 mins into the video and thinking that its going messy and unorganized compared to Actors round table which I recently watched. Aree!! bhai bolne ka mauka mileage sabko Have patience &quot;Alia&quot;.
Rani seems to be living in another world.
What alia is doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=1564">26:04</a> 😂😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3244">54:04</a> haaye Ram the way my cutie said ranbir so lovely love her...  N Rani WTF she&#39;s upto....
Rani needs to shut up and listen to the question...she is full of BS 🤐
Can&#39;t stop laughing after reading each one of the comments here 🤣🤣
@39.30 dipika is like ye chutiya alia kya bakwass kar rai hai....
After watching this i really feel ROUND TABLE WITH NEWCOMERS, AND ACTORS are far better than this. All these women dont know how to express and what to say. Some times they are politically correct and sometimes struggling to find right words to express. Here comes the relevance of EDUCATION. Still, by far Deepika seems and sounds sensible of all. And of course, Tabu.
Rani needs to be removed she is old fart
Deepika😘😘
Gawd Rani!
Can someone translate on what Ranveer said at 35.15
Very boring.. Left it in 9min.. Overrated stuff..
I rolled my eyes so hard when Alia said women have always been given great roles and used her father&#39;s work as an example. Mahesh Bhatt may have written good female characters  back in the 80s and the 90s but he&#39;s also the man that produces sleazy garbage that objectifies women and banks on oversexualizing them for tickets. And it almost always stars a younger, newer and more vulnerable actress who&#39;s an outsider. Alia and other rich bombay kids take the dignified roles and would NEVER do the kind of films her father produces.
I miss Sush n Kangana here 😔
I could watch tabu dying in 50 more films😍
Rani is defending all these tharki directors/producers in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> because she knows pretty well her husband and sasur ji probably did the same to other women.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2362">39:22</a> alia is talking about this and understands this because her own character in the film highway was a victim of sexual abuse by her uncle
Shame on tabu and tapsee for not speaking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23meetoo">#meetoo</a> movement!!
deepika is dull minded so she cannot usually talk good<br>tapsi is trying to be smart ,on which she succed<br>rani a bit more un genune<br>and rest of three r good with good sence of humor<br>but i m supprised by anuska she really is grown up
Rani should keep her mouth shut!!!
discussion starts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2060">34:20</a>
One thing I have noticed when we see boys interview shows there will be lot of fun comedy masti everything bt when it comes to women or girls it&#39;s too boring it looks like parliament meeting.....More over jalne ki boo.... kya ye sirf mujhko feel horaha he ya sabko???
Deeps ma lady crushhhhhhh.....She is so osm
LOVE U TABU
Why speaking over each other pls say one by one
sab bkwss hai sala
pls 2 minutes silence for Rani  Mukharji
Rani has just lost all the respect and why does alia Bhatt always have pretend like a small and cute baby it just looks super fake. Love Deepika and tabu ❤️
Kitna halla kr rhi sb
Ye sab randi chinal log hindustani log hain ye forener inki maa ki apne desh ki bhash bolne me sharam aati hai randi log ko
These women are gems. ❤️
Lovely interview.. enjoyed watching it .. rajeev
Why kangana not invited
See Tabu&#39;s expression at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=3184">53:04</a> when Rani says she had crush on Juhi and Aamir.😂😂😂😂
This is a complete waste of time rather , it teaches us what not to say and what to. Don&#39;t praise Deepika, she is stupid, answers politically and thinks slow. Personally Anushka I had a opinion on the topic. Actresses like Priyanka can only convince the patriarchal society to change.🤷
Tapsee is sooooooooooooooo beautiful
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=765">12:45</a> Anushka’s ear rings looks like jalebi 😁
How come Aishwarya is never at these round tables?
But why r ppl hating on rani tho?
Without kangana??
among all deepika 👍I miss kangana through whole the conversation.
Can&#39;t waste my 1 hour
When Anushka speaks, it sounds like they&#39;ve increased the playback speed!
arey ye kya bawasir bna diye ho 😂😂 itne intelligent log ek sath baithe hain 😂
Can we please talk about how irritating but how obviously passionate Tapsee Pannu is?
deepika and anushka are best and she looking very beautiful
Love u anushka only for u 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💖💖💖💖💖👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌👌👌😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Deepak is a fake actres....... love u anushka you are the <br>the best person and best actres in bollywood keep it my lovely lady love u god bless
Why is Rani wearing sunglasses inside wtf
Rani is getting old.but tabbu is sexy now
Anushka looking very gorgeous
I think what Rani Mukherjee implied is that, <br>1. All women should respect all other women, rather than wrongly criticizing them about their lifestyle, clothes and work and stop victim blaming.<br>2. Even if we start teaching our boys  and men how to respect women and how not to disrespect them, the fact is it is still gonna take some time to see the impact on our society, meanwhile why not actually learn to fight? Changes aren&#39;t coming over night , even not in a year or two, it is going to take at least a generation, you have to wait..... During this transition period we can&#39;t be at their mercy, that he decides to spare me, or <b>he</b> <b>chooses</b> to not to molest me.... It&#39;s not telling women to change, its the bitter fact....
While traveling in a public bus many times people touch you inappropriately, then you put up a hashtag on your Facebook account that.... This happened and a hashtag in it..... Or you slap that bustard squarely on the face or at least call him out in front of other passengers or slap such a person for the vulnerable vict...... Which one do you think is more practical? Even the people who harass women in private shouts for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> in public? Where is the actual solution? The mentality isn&#39;t gonna change in a few days or hours? It will take time and a very long time.... Meanwhile why not actually fight back?
There is nothing wrong in learning to fight at school levels, because there will be always a class of people who are not gonna change and look down on women as the &quot;weaker&quot; kind 😒..... In that case a square slap or a kick on tge right spot might show them we can protect ourselves and they better not mess with us...as for people who feel vulnerable in such situations, it is even more important to do their counseling and help them to gain courage! It is not easy to speak up then and there, but thats why you should practice to have such mindset, because at the end protecting yourself is the goal!
I think what Rani Mukherjee wanted to imply is that,<br>1. All women should support every woman, rather than criticizing other women for their lifestyle and works and clothes and stop victim blaming.<br>2. Even if we are trying to make men understand how to respect women, fact is it is going to take a long time still to see that result in our society, to see its impact on the society, meanwhile why cant we learn how to fight against those molesters and rapists, then and there? We can&#39;t be at their mercy, &quot;vagwan k liye mujhe chhordo.... And wait and pray he lets me go&quot;..... <b>He</b> chooses to let me go..... That doesn&#39;t make sense and that is exactly women have been doing wrong since ages, you teach someone to be good person fine,most important step, but second important step is to learn to stand up...merely making a hashtag in social media might show the vastness of the problem, but it is never the solution. At the end of the day some people will just make it another fad! Then where is the justice or muh tor answer?
Sound quality is bad
Hi..And u don&#39;t review KGF.. knowing that most of ur news channels audience from South,this is wat u do..u can review Hollywood movies but not a blockbuster regional movie
The one to win the award is Rajeev....Only a superhuman cld have endured the nonsense from all directions!
Every person is fake
Came here to see what&#39;s the drama about. Didn&#39;t expect rani to start victim blaming, she doesn&#39;t understand the concept of vulnerability
To be very honest, I feel i am anushka, the way she kept placing the fruits in right way and kept changing it... THAT&#39;S ME (Social anxiety)  I understand you Nush!!
i wish PRIYANKA, KANGNA AND SHRADDHA to be on the round table.
Anushka and aaliya looking more beautiful and they spoked quite well also
The controversial topic starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKFLiAztJ5Y&amp;t=2160">36:00</a>
Most irritating, annoying, know it all award goes to Rani!! Very narrow minded. Feel like putting a duct tape on her mouth.
All are my super fav! god bless all!
But I kinda agree with Rani, everything starts from the home, do all your best to raise you kids well... you don&#39;t want your son to abuse any women, just teach him how to respect women.
1 Tabu<br>2 Taapse <br>3 Alia <br>4 Rani <br>5 Anushka<br>6 Deepika <br>Deepika is Soo overrated
Tabu is like &quot; kya Chutiye hai Yaar.&quot; Except Deepika and Tapsee.
Urdu version as well....please
Other actresses when Rani is speaking (in there head) : Churail kya bol rahi hai. Bitch yashraj ki malkin nahi hoti toh beep beep beep....<br>Into her face privately : Wow Rani your opinion n PoV is so upto the point.... Amazing BTW the new yashraj project is coming up right. Any chances of me there??
Hope people got Kangna&#39;s reaction rightly over rani&#39;s opinion! whoever thought Kangana will oppose rani, they definitely needed burnol after knowing Kangana&#39;s rection!
missing Kangna!!!!! seriously
anushka kis se race lga rhi he
ek dusre ko kaat lo bc
In a country where girls lack proper education she is talking about  martial arts...not many can afford that.... feels like she is living in her own world.
Mr Rajeev! I think there is a way to talk individually. Not altogether. It&#39;s irritating when u see some one among them keep silent.<br>Please develope that way.
Deepika is WAY above this discussion.  She is a beautiful intelligent woman who speaks with grace and compassion.  How is it that everyone else talks at once and does not listen to what anyone else has to say?  Deepika has a lot of patience to sit through this gaggle.
It&#39;s not about women taking charge of themselves, it&#39;s about men changing the way they view women - it&#39;s about men learning to respect ALL women.  Saying that women need to change the way they present themselves is completely missing the point.  Why should women walk around &quot;on guard&quot; waiting for someone to attack them?  We should feel completely relaxed in life - not defensive and feeling the need to protect ourselves.  In my country men can walk around without their shirts so why should women dress &quot;accordingly&quot;.
When nepotism is everyone’s baap 😁😁 in a horrible disgusting thing like a round table sucks to have these ppl as role models for younger girls these days they act meek, are stupid and have no sense of independence
Tabu the best.
What actually there were talking about ..no patience to listen full episode..who is best in discussion and why??please tell me the nice timings wer I can see the points discussed and their behavior...
Roundtable discussion hai ya parliament 😂😂
Everyone in competition with each other....interrupting, not listening to other&#39;s point of view...except Deepika and tabu mam seriously, 😂😂
Rani&#39;s opinion on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#MeToo</a> movement is not just extremely uneducated but also devoid of empathy. Shame.
Rani Bichari &quot;i have met mother Theresa.. What a woman.. 😂😂&quot;
Masha Allah deepika kinni pyari lg rhi h
D=Deepika=Dignified... She comes from such great upbringing it shows!
Anushka&#39;s words travel faster than light
I wish it was Priyanka Chopra, Sushmita Sen, Kangana Ranaut, Deepika Padukone , Sonam Kapoor and Radhika Apte. That would have been more interesting to listen to and watch
This is incomplete without kangna Ranaut
Sharradha missing
These discussions are amazing and much needed for Conscious Impact. How about a Child artists Roundtable !?
Tabu - Get some real actresses
How do I block this bollywood shit from showing up for me?
I have enjoyed these roundtables so far, but this particular discussion seems dumb and boring
<b>FAKENESS OVERLOADED!!!</b>
Felt like except Tabbu, no one knows the basic debate or communication skills. You don’t keep interrupting other person in the middle of what he/she’s saying!  Messy conversations.
Deepika thinks too much.... Needs to just chat that&#39;s it
I wish Rani to dissappear from every talk shows like her movies. She is just over lucky to born in big family and getting married to big shot as a second wife thats why she feels very protective from actual world and talk nonsense and try to be bossy. Respect for all other women deepika, anushka and alia who opposed rani&#39;s view on me too movement.
Please make actress round table for deepika, kangana, vidya, and priyanka....i want to see them on the same table to give opinion about their acting in bollywood.
God! What&#39;s rani saying..... Mtlb kuch bhi 😠
Loved rani&#39;s vision.coz when there is leak in dam,any how u stop water it will flow wrongly.its u who need to construct it.never rely on  social changes,it will never happen, coz rape is happening like a daily soup.girls have take their safety on their own hands as done by tanu shree dutta (me too)
Among all those I think   tabu is the actor and all those just stupid .i never get their acting skills
Anuska&#39;s films are laughable.she is always pompous
How anuska reached such height?lol
Rani Mukerji kahi aapke pathi ya Bhai one kisike saath misbehave Kiya hai?? Just shut up your pathetic lowlife mouth
Anuska was batak
Difference btw actors and actresses roundtable?<br><br>Ans: Actors genuinely like and respect each other and it shows!
Indira Gandhi aka cruella Deville
Rani is quite annoying....luvd taapse dp Aliya
Why is RANI reminding everyone of their chance and hurrily waiting to shut people.
What an UNORGANIZED show, thanks to Tabu, who added some worth to the show. These woman are very good in their respective acting careers, now how about they do reality some justice 😒
Rani glasses reminds me of  safety glasses which is wore by mens at work during construction site
aliya is a baby , instead of her ashwariya or kangana should be there
Kangana Ranaut, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit Nene and Kajol? If Rani is there, these people could have also been there.
Rani&#39;s brother has been accussed of harassing girls ..and she is talking about changing women first...there is a point when she is talking to herself ......god she really needs to shut up <br>Tabu is the only one poised ...all others want footage
even the newcomers are better than rani &amp; anushka. the newcomers roundtable was enjoyable &amp; sorted
If I would be there, I will be like<br>Abe chup ho jaa behen rani<br>Her voice and words are too meaningless &amp; annoying 😒
Rani 😶🤫😷🤐🤦‍♀️🙅‍♀️💆‍♀️🤬🤯😡😱🤭 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Watched it to take away something from the show... damn!??!? <br>Rani : In urgeto clear the MAT/CAT.<br>Anushka: seems like practicing rapping for a movie. <br>Deepika and tabu : gracious and elegant yet wondering when am I getting rid of this damn crowd 😂
Radhika Subhedar should have been here instead of Rani Mukherjee -_-
A rani chup na..dusro ko bolne to do
Whose name did deepika mention about playing in biopic? Diana??
Deepika and Tabu were my favorites
Rani please start karate classes for all the girl - babies, children, teenagers and women and oldies in the whole world...bullshit answer..what an approach to a problem..kill all women then your problem is sorted. Absolutely disgusting thoughts you have 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮...I literally feel like slapping Rani 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋... please shut up Rani shut uppppppppp.. someone delete her from this video.. shut up Rani 🤐 🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐
I agree with Rani!
Its feels like First class ladies compartment.
Gosh! Rani, STOP TALKING! I liked you before but now you’re simply an irritating chatterbox !
Me too has toughened women,alerted youngsters,parents,teachers,new entrants in Bollywood.
