Jackie Shroff and Rishi Kapoor have starred together in films like Azaad Desh Ke Gulam (1990), Aurangzeb (2013), and Chalk n Duster (2016), but unfortunately, they never got a chance to share screen space with each other.<br><br><br>Recently, while talking to a daily, Jackie Shroff revealed how Rishi Kapoor and he wanted to share screen space in a film and this is a wish that will never come true now. Shroff said, “Chintuji always used to tell me, ‘Jaggu dada, I want to do a film opposite you. We’ve worked together in so many movies but never faced each other on camera.’ Him being a senior to me and one of the finest actors of the industry, I so wanted to act with him. I feel sad that this wish never will come true now. We’ve lost a precious jewel of the crown.”<br><br><br>Remembering his first meeting with Rishi Kapoor, Jackie Shroff said, “I remember his film Bobby (1973) had released and he shot to fame overnight. I was hanging around the Pastry Palace in Mumbai and I saw him there for the first time. I was like, ‘Wao, Rishi Kapoor!’ I wasn’t an actor then and seeing a superstar was like a fan moment to me and I never knew that one day, we would share such great camaraderie.”<br><br><br>The Ram Lakhan actor also revealed that they used to call each other and discuss Tiger Shroff’s performance. He said, “He would meet people with a big warm hug and was so jovial and always sharing good vibes. I could always feel that affection from a senior not just for myself but for Tiger as well. We would ring up and discuss Tiger’s performance in his recent movies. Coming from him really meant a lot to me.”
