Life is not fair 😢
He is so good looking ❤
Wow👏👏👏👌👌👌  brainnyyy !!
❤😊my hero heart  blowing interview 😊
it was a murder not sucide 😭😭😭
It&#39;s funny that the anchor is finding it funny?
She said &quot;The kind of level you e,erged yourself in your chracter, it is MOCKED&quot; , i swear these lines are making so much sense now that why he alws felt alone<br>Does she has the guts to say such things to SRK,Ranbir, Ranveer,Salman naaaah !!!
Miss u Prince SSR❤❤
Anupama madam what&#39;s wrong in being a Daniel day Lewis. The way you asked the question, were you been told to ask it in that way to make it appear sarcastic. Daniel earned an academy award and he is a mythological actor and sushant is one. Your Bollywood doesn&#39;t have one good actor in these times who actually works on the character .This is just what I think and my opinion
Boht miss kar raha hu sir ❤😢 Aaj phir
Kitnaa haklaati hai yeh.
We want justice for sushant
SSR❤

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=710">11:50</a>, he talks about death.
“If you know nothing, you say a lot. If you know something, what’s there to say?”
Happy Birthday Sushi ❤️<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JusticeForSushantSinghRajput</a> 🔱
Happy Birthday Sushant Singh Rajput!
Such a beautiful being
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justices">#justices</a> for sushant 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
He can’t do what we r being told about his demise he is way ahead to commit something like this real gem real lost for Indian cinema
just hear him to make myself alive one of the best normal person and actor too
🌷🙏😥❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=27">00:27</a> arjun pandey lol dis woman doesn&#39;t even do her research and calls herself a film critic
In this interview.. Ones he mentioned that &quot;relationship is no forever..you may die &quot; Kinda prediction? Or given the hints??
I have jst come here to listen his golden words his speech his sweet words which I always miss
The more i listen him talk the more i like him the more i wish to meet him but then i realise this person doesn&#39;t even exist anymore. Life and death are weird things.
Why the movie industry has to deal with drugs ? Both of em looks high
Right person trapped among wrong people and environment.
I have never seen Anupama look like that at any guest. ❤️
With due respect to interviewr, Interviewer was soo mean that she was indirectly taunting him in each question and faking the  laugh!!! Sad to see
He is one in millions where you can find many talents. 😢❤. Love you sir. R I. P
Asli insaan to mar gaya or keya bacha he💔
@sushantsinghrajput sir was not an actor, he was a genius nd no can replace sushant Singh rajput in Bollywood industry.. Sushant sir always live in SSRian heart.. We&#39;ll never forget our legend.. Miss you so much sir.. Please come back sir🙏🙏
Bro it was one of the video that seve huff use in his video to show that he can contact with Susant but that was fake and the voice is taking from this video 💌 this shows how peoples fake are ?
Kaun kaun dhruv rathee ke video dekhne ke baad yahan aya hai? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
He was Too Good for bollywood. Bollywood ends with SSR.
Ye wo samay tha jab dayan riya chakrabarti sushant ke life me nahi aayi thi she came and destroyed him kash uske life me aane se pehle woh kahi chullu bhar pani me doob ke mar jaati
MY FAVOURITE ACTOR OF ALL TIME🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
REALLY MISSING HIM 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sushant is legend
He literally predicted the bollywood industry collapsing which is exactly the fact of the day. He was bang on about it.
Hey guys 👋🏻 , Just look at Sushant&#39;s style o my Allah he is so stylish man 😎
Multi talented man in the world❤
Beautiful answer to evry question
He predicted lot of things in this interview
Such a great actor
Why does it sound like everyone knew he was about to die?
sushantt🥺🥺 why think too much. he was thinking about life in such depth while he was surrounded by a bunch of stupid people. he was so disconnected from his roots. thinking about every aspect of life in such analytical way that his brain took over his emotions.
He said he didn&#39;t have friends and people find him boring , same thing happens with me,his fun is reading books bcoz he is not talkative , very similar to me 🤦.<br>But sometimes it hurts to not have frnds
This anchor is disgusting 🤮
I met him in connaught place, new delhi. This was back in 2012 when he had just quit tv and was about to leave for new york for an acting course before starting in the movies.. He was there with his then girlfriend ankita and couple of friends. I was with there with my parents. Mom dad both used to watch pavitra rishta (his tv show) and dad told me to go say hi to him and get a picture with him.<br>Still share that picture on his every birth anniversary and death anniversary.
RIP and long live Sushant Singh Rajput (January 21, 1986 – June 14, 2020), aged 34<br>You will always be remembered as a legend.
Kitni bol rahi hai
Immortal Sushant 💜.
🌏👑🇮🇳🇳🇵🎠😇💔🤞
Sushant is a male version of Sridevi.  Both are very similar. Both are reserved off screen but create magic and transform in front of camera!
Rest in peace 🕊️✌🏼
Such a talented person
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😘😘😘💞💞💞🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🙏🏻😭😭🙄
Oh my friend 😔 i wish I can go back to the days when u were breathing...

Justice for SSR 🙏🔱
Sushant a brilliant intelligent articulate visionary fighter versatile and talented superb genius and actor humble pure hearted soul down to earth young man  pure gold a gem and missed so much, A Fan always, taken by brutally being murdered by corrupt individuals in Bollywood justice will prevail and those involved will fall like dominoes. .
Watch from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=370">6:10</a> . Goosebumps 🤯
Handsome
When he said ,”you will die in between”.<br>I  skipped a beat😭<br>RIP
Happy birthday SSR❤
No one is here💔
He is very good man and very Talented man I miss you sir
good one.
SSR miss u. Tarike badl jyegi par tum yaad Rahoge Date 13 Dec 2021
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=710">11:50</a> &quot;It will not be Forever, or you will Die in between..&quot;..... How prophetic. 😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=713">11:53</a> ❤❤
most intelligent man in bollywood.
The cutest introvert ever
He prepared for a movie which did not happen... so the boycott was already there! I think his entry in Bollywood upset a lot...
I want to say that Danish zehen, Sushant Singh Rajput and Sidharth sukla were the good souls. And I had hear so many time, that those who die in  a very young age the reason of their death is that they are the people who have good souls and always ready to help people in need.
SSR was a person who can manipulate anybody by his conversation/skills.  This is the reason why we the fans of Sushant  considered him the legend Or best Actor of bollywood.
Imtiaz chatri ko pakad ke sachayi nikalne tak nahi nikalna chahiye.. He should be given third degree treatment and admitted to cooper hospital forever..
Sab criminals ka no. ayega jaroor.. <br>Even if it&#39;s neta &amp; chela Or actors &amp; actresses, they all will be caught &amp; punished for sure..
take care Bhai 🙏💐
he was an old wise man trapped in body of young restless man. <br>he was looking  for a library in a fish market that is Bollywood.
Sushant love you genius😊😘🤩💕😇💛💫😍✨️🔥
Justice For SUSHANT Sir
It was eerie to hear him say <br>“ we may die” during the interview . <br>A sincere and genuine person
Sushant is a true gift from God, watching him, listening to him...he pushes us to think at a high level. He was a teacher without evening knowing it. Miss and love your our king
&quot;Even people like me are dying to watch...&quot; What kind of statement from a film critic like her ?.... it&#39;s her job ... Ms. Chopra ,you are all up in the air.... Sushant Singh Rajput is the name himself.....who are you? Just ask yourself
Sushant sir was a pure soul ✨ I always miss him a lot.... Can&#39;t express in words but he have taught me a lot many things through his interviews and another social media... I don&#39;t know why but till now I am not able to forget him... He was  someone very special and I think in future I will remember him forever and ever🍂🥺 Bhai I miss u a lot... Wapass aajao Bhai😔
With whom we share this unbearable pain friend, we live in that state of mind where mind stop work to find any hope, heart is like burst out, this deep pain of our soul, who will understand it, my soul is screaming for u my child, our precious bacha we will never forget u, wounds are getting fresh day by day, why u take exams of our patience God, it&#39;s enough, agr thori bhi insaniyat Ho to iske katilo ko smne la do, plzzz God.
Watching this guy in pavitra rishta and then from Kai po che to dil bechara ,it was amazing for me watching his personality development, how smart he was looking after that, and what a confidence he get, hats off to u brave boy for your developing nature and your courage, u r really combination of inner and outer beauty, missing you terribly bro

Anupama’s expressions match with Sushant’s emotions <br>Good anchoring 👍 <br>Her eyes are full of respect and love for his intelligence 👌👌<br>It takes Intelligence to recognise Intelligence <br><br>Sushant your smiles in this interview are truly captivating 🥰😍 we Love you and Miss you 😢 terribly
Future collapsing ke baare mein bhi bta diye the
A  noble soul ...legend  SSR was much knowledgeable also a good human being.  SSR will live in our hearts forever.
SSR intelligence, voice made him stand out from the ordinary crowd. Legend will be always Legend.
When Ranveer Singh prepare a role for 2 years, <br>Anupama be like : Woow Ranveer you work very hard ..I must appericiate 👏<br><br>When Sushant prepare for a role consecutively for 2 -3 years <br><br>Anupama be like :. Does it requires Sushant to prepare it for so long <br><br>Hypocrisy ki bhi sima hoti hai Mam 😓🤐
Listening to him is like learning a lot sometimes 🙏😊👍
This interview clip only that steve Huff used and the words sushant sir spoked and he said he spoked with sushant sir and now he is talking with siddharth shukla spirit what a fraud he is he still thinking indians as fools
Takleef to hoti h hme uske jane se aur log blte h hm pgl h itna kya le kr baith gye h, mar gya to mar gya, are yrrr, waise logo ke kami h n yha jinka dil saaf aur khubsurt hota h, jo zindagi sahi myne me jite h, pr ek mila to usko bhi maar dia, kaise nhi hogi takleef, ab har kisi me usko dhundhne ki koshish krte h pr wo kahi nhi milta,
Lovely guy.

He was a full packed actor
At 2.40 here is a critic who is criticizing Sushant for doing his work with exemplary passion and commitment. On on side she says we shouldn’t be appreciating you because it’s your job when she has complimented products of nepotism for 1% effort of what SSR brought to the table and on other side she says that the very same passion or seriousness he brings is mock worthy. Looks she she is caught in her own conflicted superficial approach towards being a critic 🙄. Maybe she and rest of the people in the Industry need to reflect on the current state or lack of talent and worthy content in Bollywood. Moving forward with the awareness SSR’s death has generated fewer outsiders will enter this industry and it will  continue down the path of degradation thanks to inbreeding of talentless star kids surrounded by sycophants (as this critic herself) that further boost their already inflated egos. Bollywood is on a downward spiral in terms of talent and content. RIP Bollywood since you are now a cess pool of the super entitled and non talented.
Ant tak ladenge aur Sushant ko insaaf dilayenge ✊🔥<br>Bollywood ko COMPLETELY destroy karke rahenge.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nosushantnobollywood">#NoSushantNoBollywood</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a>

What an amazing human being
I just can&#39;t get over his voice his thoughts and himself. I miss him. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushant">#justiceforSushant</a>.
The interviewer is very dumb.
Other actors spoke very light n loose abt Sushant..but SSR is a Gem 💎 never ever spoke any loose abt anybody .. that&#39;s his personality!!
Such an honest person. We have lost a gem.
Tmne apne hisse ka pyar hme de dia sushant, apne hisse ke kaam tmne kr dia, bahut kch dia h aur bahut kch sikhaya h tmne ab hmari bari h dunia ko sikhane ki, ki ek acha insaan banane ka mtlb kya h. Tmhe itna pyar denge ki tum wha us khushi ko sambhal nhi paoge, u r our hope, strength, everything
Sushant is out of all.<br>My god how can I describe him..I cant cz words will be less.What a genuine Genius..feel like keep keep listening to him❤
When SSR was alive...Anupama chopra did not release this talk live show....why now for publicity or to earn money??.
I still feel him as an idol. SSR you are missed. Rest in peace 🙏❤️
Missed you my dear shushant

A true hero, he talk about neopotism ,that makes bollywood enemy so they planned to murder because this mafia bollywood know if he rise as superstar, he will manage a good performer film magic and new talent comes...only justice
God please help him, give him justice he was wealth of our society. We r his brothers sister, plzzz bhgwan hmare bhai ko nyay dila do. What u written in your diaries sushant, I am speechless my dear... We want u back,
ssr is a one off creation in indian cinema and he was killed , rather brutally murdered, the saddest ever .
she is the most amazing journalist i ever seen, her way of interviewing someone is very good. i love to see all the interviews she conducted .
Msg for all, yesterday night Sushant came in dream want to convey his msg.-<br>&quot; All this which is happening is dikhawa. Don&#39;t waste your time by chasing them. M happy as my life was BIG. I just want to say that if you love me then start making life big by being a giver. Don&#39;t shed tears rather do something for society. &quot;<br>Several times i saw him in dream with 3 more souls- Asif Basra sir, Disha &amp; Manu ( my childhood friends brother who was just 26 years old &amp; passed away in Aug 2020.
This guy Salman khan is it the same guy who murdered the homeless man on the pavement. Why is he out of jail. He suppose to be locked up for life and the keys thrown away. Because there&#39;s no place for evil. Yes he&#39;s a murderer
Miss you ssr😭😭🙏
He was so full of life .
Miss you Sushant but I wish you were not that popular so that we could have you with us right now.
Yes he is
Ria a gold digger ........
&#39;Or you will die in between&#39; Now this line make sense ironically.
Legends never dies he is alive in our♥
When we look up to someone their innocence, purity is feel on their face. This guy is like this. Smjh me nhi ata kya kahu..
How can he be boring when he&#39;s looking super handsome and smart as hell. I could&#39;ve just stared at him and listening to him talking forever
everyone calling the geniuses having mental illness because they can&#39;t relate to mediocre brain. Just sayin!!
One part of my heart died on 14th June, 2020…... 😭😭😭💔💔💔<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfrwhOJQWB0">https://youtu.be/QfrwhOJQWB0</a>
Who called him Daniel day though
Jab tak jiyenge Sushant sir aapke fan rahenge.......❤❤<br>You are the best....👍<br>I daily pray to God that your pure soul get justice as soon as possible🙏🔱<br>Mahadev will definitely punish thoes bastrads who brutally murdered his innocent son and using his name to defame him after his brutal death🙏😢<br>You will always be my favourite and alive in my heart❤ forever....❤❤❤❤<br>Boycott Bollywood hypocrites😠😠😠
&quot;That is my fun&quot;....... Awww how sweetly you said this Sushi😊🥰😘😘
❤️
He was a diamond in coal industry named bollywood
This Interviews Say a lot lot about Him. He is a Man of Integrity ,ethics,  Morals and the intelligence and wisdom level is Beyond Infinity. The way he Explained the Tapasya Part made me fell in Love with him again. How can a men have this level of knowledge at 32. Believe it or Not, IT IS A HUGE LOSS OF INDIA. <br><br>1986-FOREVER IN THE HEARTS!💕💞<br><br>WE MISS YOU SUSH.
It&#39;s 2021 but still feels like he is alive ❤️

Strong, honest, confident, clarity, humility, handsome, healthy, fit, talented - what a beautiful man and soul! &lt;3
The true King of Bollywood. The true artist in every way. What a loss. True legend.
Huff ne iss hen interview ko apne vedio main chipka diya
Still not over his death.. we lost a gem, a great human! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceforssr</a>
HE IS A SELF MADE ACTOR.....
Rest in peace brother 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=647">10:47</a> shows how dumb the interviewer is, &quot;yoou are so funny&quot; seriously? she did not understand a shit he said
He didn&#39;t seem comfortable giving an interview.
I get a royal treat every day, videos  of this extraordinary gentleman, Sushant Singh Rajput. Boring, far from it, stimulating company oh yes, though i sometimes struggle to understand his expressive talks. Way too intense &amp; intelligent, but we know there is a side to him that is goofy, completely innocent &amp; childlike, warm &amp; caring.<br>Its only people who do not understand the importance of any of these sterling attributes, that do not appreciate it. Bless you enormously, our star🙏We know you continue to shine brilliantly. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JusticeForSushantSinghRajput</a>
We being impressed with sushant ,come back sir😂😭🙏
Sir face sea jesea handsam dikhtea thea dill sea utnea hi sarp and prem ki bhav unmea bhari hui thi justice for susant sir
Sushant Sushant Sushant ❤️❤️
I didn’t know Sushant.... I came to know him after his passing. I watched his videos, movies, interviews, just about everything about him , his family, love life, he’s like an open book to the whole world after he’s gone. I became a fan coz he has a very interesting personality. He’s almost perfect like handsome, intelligent, talented, great actor with money, he’s with beautiful women, n a wonderful human being, but this is where it ends.... it’s so sad n so unfortunate this happened to a guy that we all cherish n adore 🥰 😢 it really breaks my heart 💔to see Sushant on videos with his beautiful smile 😃 knowing he’s gone! We missed you Sushant so much! Love ❤️ Peace 🙏🏼 justice for Sushant RIPSSR 🙏🏼😢❤️
Is bande ko mtlb media mrne ke baad ME bhi nhi chore... Jo bhi drgs supplier pkare jaa rhe h Wo ise hi drgs supply krte the mtlb kya... Na koi saboot na kch... I just want to scream... It&#39;s so irritating... Cbi mar gai h lgta h.. Uski maut ki sachai bta do yrrr.... Itna kafi h.. Bdnaam mt kro use plzzz. Uske lie jo respect h use mt maro...
Brain of an engineer<br>Intellect of a scientist <br>Fitness of a sportsman<br>Heart of a kid<br>Innocence of a child<br>Extraordinarily Talented dancer, actor....All in one ...one n only SSR
I feel so bad
There are only few people around with soo much intellect,wise with full of energy...Man his Aura is So High...He called Himself Introvert but in my opinion if there(bollywood) would even be just 5-6 people&#39;s of his level of intellect then may be he would&#39;nt need anyone to call him in parties etc...❤️
his voice was like melted with honey ! <br>miss you sushant bhaiya.....
sushant..... I&#39;m speechless..,....come back .....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=417">6:57</a> Guys hear it.. What&#39;s  happening with bollywood?
&quot;I don&#39;t talk to many people and they also don&#39;t like to talk to me&quot;
He is too handsome❤️💔 breaks heart so much even though it is so many days ...we badly miss u
What a sweetheart,man.
SSS sir is a real gem .Will relish his intriviews on repeat .
He&#39;s talking intelligence is superb
Bri shiddat se chaha h tumhe... Kash wo chaht tmhe mujh tk khich lae...
Amazing Hero , Very Talented
Ssr apki baat apki personality alag h yrr. Koi apki takkar ka nhi aur na hi hoga kyuko bollywood me sirf kachra aur anpadh log pade hue h karan johar salman aur arjun kapoor jese. Jinko 17th ki table bi ni aati hogi.
😠😠😠 God she&#39;s stupid! He&#39;s talking breathing wisdom and she&#39;s so f-ing platonic. It&#39;s just fake. English major karne se insaan mai depth nahi aata. <br><br>I know my comment will add into engagement for the channel but I&#39;ll do it if I get to call out such bullshit<br><br>You are a star Sushant!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Very very handsome and multitalent Sushant bhai 😭😭😭😭
Sabse alag thaa hamara gulshan!! Forever the national treasure and pride gem 💎 of india 🇮🇳!<br>Hamesha hamare dilon mein! <br>The most unique divine ✨ entity!! India and world have ever seen! Jan 21st 1986-infinite!
⭐️ 🦋 ❤️ Being compared with the legendary Daniel Day - Lewis at an age of just 34 is in itself a greatest compliment ever in Bollywood which is full of mediocre actors whose only aspirations is vices drugs and obscenity both on and off screen.. SUSHANT’S SMILE AFTER SHE SAID THIS WAS ALSO OF AN APPROVAL SORT OF THAT “ITS GOOD TO KNOW THIS ACTUALLY” TYPE 😂 <br>SSRs contemporaries who are all Jokers will never even touch let alone master, this level of intellect and methodical acting of immersing in a character day in and out .. all the ameer baap ki bigadi hui aulads
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#JusticeForSSR</a>
Brilliant man on earth ...love u Sushant Singh Rajput sir ❤️
I think in this interview Sushant bled his heart out because of which I think pissed off the Nepotistic industry to kill him! Very Sad....Miss you Sushi
Jisne bhi shushant ko mara h..wo sab kutte ki mout marenge...saalo ne ek pal ko bhi nhi socha..itni mehnat karke ek common ladka yaha tak pahucha..uske saare sapne chhin liye in kamino ne...nark milega unko..marna hi tha..to kisi kamine ko karte kuch to ish duniya ko fayeda hota..
U said it 4 yrs back...this industry will collapse....I mean OMG....you were so true...u r just wow....SALMAN SHAHRUKH etc etc should listen to u
From USA - Tears. An ERA end! Boycott Bollywood! Thank you  our only daring daughter Kangana ! God bless you! Whole WORLD need justice for the GOD&#39;s kid &quot;SSR&quot;. He came for a purpose. Bollywood ka vinaash hoga for sure!
Oh this bitch got guts to ask from same thing from buddha like salman

In interview he was looking so humble, optimistic, ambitious and full of positivity.......Life is so unpredictable....Always miss u Shushant.....You were a true achiever.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=211">3:31</a> the expression in anupama mam&#39;s face feels like she is really feeling bad for shushant
Nobody is smart and intelligent like him in the bollywood.
Sushant is so good looking and handsome other than bollywood actors so they jealous for him.
Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput

How did she take d interview.i wud have been lost in him .he is like oh my god
Miss u so so much.
I stopped watching bollywood &amp; hollywood years ago + all the news &amp; gossip. But every so offten I would just check into utube on the latest, but as per usuall same old garbage. <br>Recently a friend mentioned a murder/ suicide of a guy called S.S.RAJPUT in bollywood. <br>I utubed latest bollywood news &amp; started to watch the Indian news broadcasts &amp; from the utubers of India (much better informed) Also feeds were coming up about an actress, k. Ranault. Nepotism, starkids, sly h.roshan &amp; narcissist k.johar etc. <br>Didnt understand why is all of India in such an up roar &amp; boycott of bullywood ? Yes it is very sad a young actor had passed away in tragic circumstances but so have others ie Jia khan &amp; Parvern Bobby.(RIP)<br>It has now been 2 days of binge watching &amp; catching up on the past 7 months of SSRAJPUT. As I have managed to digested all the available content I found my self becoming captivated like as if some sort of mystical mist engulfing &amp; consuming me from within. The mysterious magestic  Sushant Singh Rajput converted me into a staunt supporter of  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssrajput">#justiceforSSRajput</a> and a firm fan for always. ~<br>I also believe that the whole world is watching democratic India with baited breath. If ever there was a fight between Power, Fame &amp; Status this is it India. The citizens young &amp; old the working class, the underprivileged,the people of the nation &amp; religious beleifs United as we once were before apartheid. The wheels of justice move slowly.<br><br>I am now going to binge watch all movies &amp; interviews of  Sushant Singh Raput. I truly believe had he not passed away  <br>Hollywood Bollywood he came he saw he conqured  ~💕💕💕~  <br>We here in the UK had Diana Princess of the nations heart. <br>Sushant Singh Rajput is yours. <br><br>: إِنَّا لِلَّٰهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ                       ‎,<br>ʾinnā li-llāhi wa-ʾinna ʾilayhi rājiʿūn.<br>~Verily we belong to Allah, and verily to Him do we return. ~<br> Final word, I was a die hard fan of amitabh bachan. His tweet  absolutely  abhorrent. A wolf in sheeps clothing or the devil in disguise? The 3 khans more like<br>Judas x3. As for the females plastic fantastic. The whole fraternity a laughing stock on a global level.
What a gem!
The world has lost an incredibly, intelligent and amazing man !!! <br>Very passionate about his work !<br>Throws himself into the character like <br>DDL who is a fantastic actor !! <br>Justice for SSR !!!
Never saw an actor with such an intellect!<br>What a fine language!<br>How wonderful he speaks.<br>The GENIUS SSR, one and only KOHINOOR DIAMOND!<br><br>A Kumar, Prof. of German, Frankfurt
Rip Sir big fan
This same line ssr told bullywood will collapse.... Now the time...come...
I don’t like Anupama as she has always made fun of him. She favors nepotism. But this was only SSR who answered all her questions beautifully
How is it possible  a 34 year old, full of potential is taken away from the world?
Justice for SSR
Isko Bolte hai interview<br>Thank you Ma&#39;am for letting Sushant speak his heart out...Woh tab bhi kitnaaaaaa Kuch kehh rha tha but we didn&#39;t know that he was suffering in silence
Look at that energy mannnn while he speaks !<br>He was like a Volcano 🌋 inside or  justttt like Ocean 🌊 probably<br>Calm on the outside lekin andarrr sabbbbbbbbbbbb Stormy
miss..u..... No words..
Justice for ssr and disha
Miss him ... hope justice is served to his killers
Honest guy .. hurt many frauds
Honest guy .. hurt many frauds
F... Off nepotism in bollywood
Hard to understand him ,
Got recommend ed.., hating most of the bollywood and neopo kids<br>Not going to watch nepo kids forever
Most handsome Rajput 🙏♥️
...now I think it were just such amazing interviews-inner brilliant, wonderous areas of intellectual charm Sushant, that&#39;s why remaining all jokers got horrified by his very presence in Bollywood...!
How much he enjoyed acting ...rascals killed him !
Coolie no. Is the example.... Don&#39;t watch these bastards varun dhawan and sara ali khan
Amazing guy
Oh god... He was such a fine actor. <br>A kind hearted man and Truely very talented... I always enjoy watching his movies I miss him...
Superb interview 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️
We miss you Sushant sir 🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️
I still miss you man. Watching ur old interviews. RIP SSR 🙏
Wow he is <a href="http://like.me/">like.me</a><br>......:(
Perfect example that, &quot;marne k baad hi kimat hoti hai,&quot; so, live life to express not impress, fuck society🤘
I luv this video and U and Anupama....it was so refreshing and so,not like the normal,usual star interviews.
Anupama Chopra in all interviews with Sushant always touched on the topic of spiritual and perhaps even death and afterlife!
Its not so much about nepotism or can outsiders coexist. Its as simple as whether filmmakers and producers are comfortable and want to do the convenient thing which is asking film families or anyone who&#39;s close and connected to make films, or do they want to do the risky thing which is to do countless auditions thereby allowing outsiders. With that being said film industry shouldn&#39;t waste outsiders time and energy if they decided to practice favoritism, cliques b.c they&#39;re used to it and industry operates that way.
Rare to see genuine interview like this (because of Sushant) , rest Bollywood has no idea about this guy .. they won&#39;t get it ever.. RIP brother! Hope u r doing well in another world :)
Love you both❤❤We all miss Sushanth so much. The stinking industry could not cope with this fragrance. Shame on them. They conspired to finish him.
Boycott Bollywood
Love to hear him again and again<br>Sushant❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Even anupama chopra is hypocrite.

Bollywood scared of outsiders, justice for SSR ❤️👍🙏
Honestly!!<br>His vibes were coming through my phone and just reacted towards my vibes! He had a lot inside but words or language is an incomplete medium to bring out all that! Missing such a pure soul! 💔😭
And who was that young contemporary actor who said so??? Can u please shame him for the sake of justice for this poor , innocent soul??
SUSHANT YOU ARE BORN HERO.... AND WILL ALWAYS BE OUR HERO
😭 His words are so correct
What an excellent talk show unlike the gossip of KWK....such a sensible speaker, awesome thinker, a genius par excellence....
Miss you Sushant ❤️
Boycott bhatts first!!!!
He became kids angel so we should call him ANGEL SSR he gave his life to save girl child ,he wants to stop child trafficing ,we as the responsible citizens of India should concern about security of our kids and others too becoz we are not in position to loss another SSR or to wait someone else to give his , her life to stop child trafficing .then only we can tribute ANGEL SSR

The interview which Steve Hoff used
Sushant was very very handsome intelligent cute and achha Insan
Anupama Chopra is usually an excellent interviewer.... But with Sushant, first time I see her being mean!!!! Why???
No words.. Just an inspiration for all.. beyond imagination he is!!<br>Child of God 🙌
If I watch you talking like this.. I will cry.. Cannot forget you.. And your age like my son&#39;s age.. Sorry boy.. I cannot take it.. Good bye.. Come back again.. Your voice make me cry.. Love you boy forever you are a baby for us for ...I Am old woman. <br>So I feel like I miss you so much sir.. You are living in our hearts.. Love you sir.. So calm.. Your face like a child who love every one truely.. We all love you and also miss you too.. Good bye sir.. Forever we will love you forever and forever sir.. Thank you very much sir for sharing this message..
He was too sane and all the Bollydiots collectively bullied him and called him mad. Seriously, I know Karan Johar is probably just a fool who doesn&#39;t know how mediocre and foolish he is, but I Pity him . He has on video record mocked Sushant and proved himself to be a fool of highest order for posterity.
He speaks of Nepotism at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=365">6:05</a> mark. He was excellently clear and prophetic. Nepotism rules in Bollywood. And their PR won&#39;t confuse whole public.
You will be missed for Ages SSR. For me Dhoni name meant nothing. It&#39;s just your excellent craft that made me realize oh there is this cricket person of talent out there. What a tragedy that we have lost you to a murder most cunning and murdered by a whole establishment that is getting away with making it sound like suicide. I am sure millions like me wont forgive them. For us, Bollywood is dead. It died in 2020.
&#39;If you don&#39;t understand my silence, you can never understand my words&#39;<br>- Sushant Singh Rajput
Anybody can see she was trying to embarrass him but it&#39;s only he was patient n smart
We love u sushant we miss you!!!!!:
Such a lovely person he was..
I love his interviews
So handsome, sensitive and articulate ❤️. What a tragic loss for this world.
This man is so brilliant! Idk why Indian audience never recognized him as a talented actor? Its ur fault people atleast try to give him justice! It will be best tribute to him! Even this anchor dnt knw what he exactly saying.He was far far better than other actor.Huge <a href="http://lost.rest/">lost.Rest</a> In Peace Legend!
Rhea druggie hai
Byomkesh didn&#39;t do well. Sorry Sushant...that your fans were sleeping while you were alive. That they couldn&#39;t recognise your talent when you were alive. Today, their  wolf cry for justice has made you a drug addict in the eyes of law. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not here to see the joke that the country has made of your death.... <br>I hope you&#39;ve found your little heaven among the stars. Rest in peace...
Just miss him can&#39;t believe he is not alive, bollywood is rubbish
I feel so sad hearing that I dont have many friends because I dont talk that well and I am boring and that they also dont want to talk to me because they want to have fun and so I read books. Seems like my story too.... :(
Ma&#39;am thank you for the interview..you were making him so comfortable that he can speak from his heart..
@anupama.Chopra look how comfortable with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#ssr</a> you are, sitting cross leg relax. Did you even realize, as you are never like this, at least we have not seen you in any interview. Awesome he talked about Nepotism,  small actor survivorship and how industry can collapse and we need to bring new to come out of sequels ( please no other Dabaang  get the message from us too as we don’t want to see him???) wow open talk to Bollywood how they avoid him and do not want to talk to him. You, as a critic must have realized his pain and what was he going through as we can see in his eyes, they were red with tears, and sure you saw it too as your eyes were tearful too, it shows clearly as you know what was going on in the industry then and through till 2020 his demise but, you never came to support <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceforssr</a> ....why is it because of your Dal roti is given by Bollywood . Shame on you, @anupama.Chopra how you are a true hypocrite of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bollywood">#Bollywood</a> still doing chamchagiri for the stars till today, we see it on your social media platforms. Go look “Two Face”  ki Hallat in Batman Begins. How much you need mucho dinero to be sustainable till death, you have made enough. Please come out now start supporting and stop the chamchagiri....
He was right I never felt bad sad for any actior other then divya bharti but as SSR you right in relationship you have to invest time
Brilliant IQ 👌👌👌if you know nothing you say a lot.. If you know something what&#39;s there to say 100% correct 👌👌👌 I&#39;ll never get tired of hearing him talk 😍😍😍😍😍
Ssr is the world&#39;s youngest role model forever.....
I am proud<br>I lived in this period where SSR lived
WOW!!! What an intelligent interview sushants IQ is on another level 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice">#justice</a> for SSR 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
So honest, real gem
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=360">06:00</a> Nepotism
Because  of  him <br>I  understand  true meaning of passion..<br>He can&#39;t be replaceable.
He is soo real he can&#39;t do show off.<br>He is inspiring and we miss him😢
He didnt had to be this specific and intricate about all the answers....His intelligence was also his stupidity.....come on man ....you just needed to be a little simple
My Sush ❤️❤️❤️
He is not my fav. Actor but i don&#39;t know after his death felling very bad like someone who is very close to me died . I know not only me everyone is felling like that . I think perhaps there is magic . because never happend like that . there is a magic of god . or suahant only 🤔🤔😥😥😓
what a brilliant person we have lost !! very sad... cant believe he is not alive anymore.
Others interviewing him lack the level of intelligence that she brings by being open to such a possibility.
I think Bollywood media interviewers lost their brain cells over time because they are obsessed with the shallow/vain things. After that, they just stop thinking. There is no thinking outside the box. We need to go back to the analytical and intuitive part of our brains. Sushant was a prodigy and he was too intelligent for the likes of these unevolved beings.
If u know nothing,u say a lot...guys this line reflects a lot of things...
Finally case of murder section 302 is about to register by CBI....🙏🙏
A person so excited that he just sleeps 4-5 hours a day, was sleeping ALL day and doubting his acting abilities and even himself, once Rhea entered his life.<br>Obviously, evidence of some major major foul play!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=984">16:24</a>👌
Ssr was brilliant
I can keep watching and hearing his voice for hours...such an incredible human being ❤️
He was extremely intelligent.
Is interview or time pr Sushant Singh Rajput  ka face kitna fresh or glowing hae . Ankhon me ek behtreen brightness hae . Lekin 2018 se 2019 tak ate2 Sushant Singh Rajput ke face wo glow kam hota ja raha tha . 2020 ate uske ankhon ke as pas dark circle age the akho or face wo wala Utsah or chamak missing hota ja raha tha. Sushant Singh Rajput kya ho raha tha tumare sath . Sushant tum itne samajhdar hote hue kaise Reha Chakrabarti jaisi gandi ladki ko apne itne kareeb ane diya . Uske age apne ko tumne Sushant,Surrender or diya . Usne tumari kya halat bna Dali thi . Tumhe kaise pta nahi chla ki Reha tumari Jindgi se khilwad kar rahi hae .Sushant Wishwas nahi hota ki tum nahi ho .darassal tum hae jagah ho . 130 kadod Bhartiyon ke dilon me ho .Shayad hi kabhi kisi film Star ko itna pyar mile hamne to aj tak nahi dekha .Bas an Bhagwan se prarthna hae ki tumare htyaron ko Ajiwan karawas ki sja ho .
He was very honest in all his interviews....
Its shocking..the way 14th june snatched him away..so brutally...he is an innocent brilliant true star ..intelligent enough that u can&#39;t ignore him and smart enough that you can&#39;t compete with...that&#39;s why all this bad to him coz he is far far beyond them...a gem at a wrong place where none of his caliber..all they can do groupism n avoiding to boycott..otherwise they risk their existence.  I strongly feel big reasons hidden behind this murder and his soul is so pure n powerful that he will get justice thorough our voices raised together.
The most inspirational person in my entire life
It’s so sad to see people blaming this man for his own death, putting allegations on him without any proof...it’s sick. Mankind is disgusting and he didn’t deserve to be around such sick humans. Nothing will change the fact that he was murdered. Nothing can bring him back. He was so kind and intelligent, worked so hard to form his name and all these people are doing everything to tare it all apart. Killing the dead man again and again. The dead don’t speak so blame him for everything. They can’t even leave his soul at peace in Heaven. God is watching. Be afraid. No faith in the judiciary any longer. God, it is all up to you. It is up to you to keep our faith in justice. Please do 😔🙏🏽🔱🦋

Teri azmat k taraane gun-gunane lage hain...<br>Tere jaane k baad sab tujhe chahne lage hain.💔
Extraordinary human being indeed... Will always be missed... And bollywood will regret every moment now on for murdering <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ssr">#SSR</a> ... Har Har Mahadev 🙏🔱💫
Look at Anupama how she interviews star kids and khans .. look at her here .. sounding dumb and just trying to pretend that she is interested asking him questions. The whole bollywood lobby should be taught a lesson . No more spending money on craps stars .. though kurla mumbra guys will make bhais movie a hit
“We shouldn’t be praising you cuz that’s ur job”... I’m sorry, but you don’t seem to not have time for complimenting Gully Boy or star kid “struggle”.<br><br>Hypocrisy + Drugs + Evil form of Nepotism + Evil in general = Bollywood
He is a genuine guy
Who all disliked the video and why 😕😑
Shushant lots of love ❤️❤️❤️ Forever in our hearts..!! Miss u...
Please upload the full video. it seems edited at a few places.
💔💔
That&#39;s is happen in anyway
I never cry too much ,when other actor die... But he&#39;s the only 1 i crying like my family die.. Love from Nagaland
Very nice person.....we all lost him...Justice for SSR...voice with courage n bold..
Anyone will never fill the spaces of sushant untill real sushant will come back
Sushant is so handsone and down to earth.
Specially this interview is great
I am crying to watch someone who was more intelligent and humble than the whole of Bollywood put together and made more sense than the rest of the Bullywood
He lived 💯 years in short life span<br>He will solve the mafia problem<br>          Now
Yeh interview mai 50 times dehk chuki hu<br> I miss u 😭 Shushant<br># justice for Shushant
really enjoyed the conversation. its a not fake ,its open and candid conversation. Sad that he ended his life abruptly at his peak of career.
&quot;you will die in between&quot; kills my heart again
It shows He has a beautiful mind! Brilliantly Intelligent and very humble!
Keep revisiting his memories! Cannot fathom the fact he is no more.  I didn&#39;t realise the dept of how much this loss has dug me deep. 3 months later, you are still very much alive to me. Praying for justice for you 🙏🔱🦋💝💔❣
I hope Anupama Chopra watches this interview once more to restore her skills
How down to earth this guy, 0 attitude &amp; sero arrogance, very calm &amp; intelligent guy,Best personality  I have ever seen in Bollywood
What an absolute sweetheart he is . Adorable
I regret every single day that why I didn’t support u,love u or saw ur talent intelligence when u were alive... it’s really hurtful to realize that a talented person like u lost his life 💔💔💔
3 months today. Sushant Singh Rajput. Sorry Bro. Because nothing substantial happened so far.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=604">10:04</a>.. He read lot of inspirational book, so it&#39;s natural that he quotes some that were inspired from intelligent people&#39;s experience. And believing some of things, actually means connecting to it and excepting it. It&#39;s right<br><br>But he wanted to say their is lot of learned from intelligent people which will connect to ur dreams and way of thinking.<br><br>But for him to condensed it to give a thought and give general statements which will connected everybody should come from his own personal experience, so that he can back it up with examples.<br><br>He is too brilliant, very good learner, getting inspired from it and  still is able to make his mark by giving independent thought over general subjects. Simplifying himself to convey complex ideas.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=650">10:50</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=651">10:51</a>🤗
JUSTICE FOR SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT NOW - WORLD IS WATCHING -
He dedicated so much, he deserved  a award for ms dhoni, and the fake industry didn&#39;t even appreciate him. Fake awards
No stopping till<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JusticeForSushantSinghRajput</a><br>Dear Sushant Bhaiyya..lots of love from the souls of Indians ...<br>We miss you so much...<br>Sorry for everything, for,  we didn&#39;t appreciate you enough, when you were around us,,extremely sorry Sushant Bhaiyya..Hope You  forgive us...
no more khans and star kids after this please
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=387">6:27</a> &quot;A whole Industry collapsing....&quot;<br>What insight of SSR.<br>Bollywood u made ur bed.<br>DOOMED 4 LIFE.
Unfortunately that industry rather reward coked up extroverts who suck up to all the important people
He could have been the Michel fassbender for us 🥺 so so so unfortunate that we are so used to mediocrity. He was really right when he said nepotism is ok if there is no mediocrity but if that’s the only thing then it’s something to think about .
His words meant so much more when he said nothing is permanent not even life
I think he should have picked another career instead of acting.  He had the brains to do anything. <br>Perhaps he should have picked a more intellectual job. However,  he did have success in this industry, but I dont think he was satisfied with the  content of the entire industry.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=720">12:00</a> :(
Oh Sushant! You were too refined and intelligent for this gutter shit industry. I wish you hadn’t come here, they got so so jealous and insecure that they eliminated you. Your smile, your childish enthusiasm, your depth, your looks and above all, your beautiful heart, it’s impossible not to miss you. We’re fighting for you and we’ll get you justice. Rest in eternal peace, my dear!
Sushant’s passing is a HUGE loss for Bollywood...He truly loved his art and really worked at it ...  He will be so missed, as an actor and for the human being he was in this insane place called Bollywood ...!!
I don’t find u boring sushant. You are the most interesting person
I totally resonate with how he feels man. He also felt that no one understood him but he is so relatable
People don’t just listen.
We all relate to him so much as we have all been there in life. Somebody has cheated on us. Lied to us. Taken for granted. Bullied by colleagues. Someone has misused our money. We have struggled with our career. That’s why we love him
He says &#39;nepostism is thriving&#39;
Trying to pull him down with brushing aside his efforts for the role. If he was a star kid you would be going all gaga over smallest thing. Shame on you Anupama Chopra!
Sushant was articulate, answered all the questions well, he didnt dodge answering questions.  It was very difficult for him to not be acting for almost a year.  Seems like he was restless.
Hahahaha...hypocricy at his high.. Opening line by miss Chopra and viewers relate it Sanju produced by Mr Chopra...Enough madam take break..
Love u Sushant sir ❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘. It was my dream to meet you at once in my life bt now...😭😭😭 I miss u Sushant sir... really miss. I wish u come back.
Miss you badly Sushant <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushant">#JusticeforSushant</a>
Celebrity : Please love and praise me<br>Public : sure, but after you die<br>😏😏😏
So much I can relate to what he is and what he talks about.. Same zodiac effect for sure
He is a legend, very intellectual man. Bollywood will never ever would have had somebody like him.<br>Bollywood you&#39;re dead now.<br><br>And this interviewer is very fake, she didn&#39;t understand a lot of intellectual things he said, she laughed a fake laugh and then maintained that fake smile. She is one of those People who worked against him, trying to write blind articles, Shame on you b&quot;#$$@
See he says in this video he is not partying person.  He reads in his free time and sleeps only 2 hours. <br>How culprits saying he had party at home .. that was that Rhea bitch...patying
this was the best self ,...he had
the fact is the change<br>what if you die in between
Shame on Anupama.. Trying to mock SSR
I miss you SSR plz come back 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
He is a role model.🥺🥺😫😭😭
What a beautiful person Sushant Singh Rajput is. Anyone can easily fall in love with him. So clear to his own ideas, so much down to earth he is. Lots and lots of love to you Sushant. I will always love you.
Yes<br> Sushant sounds intelligent <br>Makes lot of sense
Purposefully targeting him this old lady
I have seen her interviewing Sushant many times ..bt have just read an article maybe 7 days ago..in which she has written that she likes jahnvi acting n we should appreciate the talent...oh really mam...does sush had no talent...n u said industry has superstars who are self made like Rajkumar n ayushmann..I agree...then who was Sushant?? Let me tell u...he was, he is n will forever bigger n better than they are...Kisi k dreams Tod do aur dusro ko appreciate kro ..big shame...n guys don&#39;t think ye sab m likh rhi Hu kyunki m abhi SSR ki fan Bani hu.nhi I am his fan since his show...bt I was not interested in Bollywood gossips n interviews ever ..
SSR&#39;S CASE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT EYE OPENING DASTARDLY INCIDENT OF THE MOST HEINOUS ACTIVITIES... WITH THIS EVEN THOUGH SSR IS PHYSICALLY NOT PRESENT HE IS WORKING THROUGH MILLIONS BRINGING ABOUT THE AWAKENING OF THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS NEVER BEFORE SEEN OR HEARD... HE IS ACTIVATING THE WHOLE MASSIVE CRUSADE FOR JUSTICE &amp; TRUTH... WHILE ALSO BRINGING OUT ALL THE DIRTY SECRETS &amp; MUCK OF BOLLYWOOD &amp; THE SYSTEM OUT IN FRONT FOR ALL TO SEE VERY CLEARLY.. SSR IS IMMORTAL &amp; STILL IS A WINNER OF THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE MAGNITUDE... <br>HE IS SOMEONE BEYOND ONE&#39;S REMOTEST IMAGINATION... A MIRACLE IN THE MAKING... 🙏🙏🙏🤗<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottantiindiamedia">#BoycottAntiIndiaMedia</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottaajtakmedia">#BoycottAajTakMedia</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalprayersforssr">#GlobalPrayersForSSR</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbi4disha">#CBI4Disha</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23warriors4ssr">#Warriors4SSR</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushanthdeathmystery">#SushanthDeathMystery</a> <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dilbechara">#dilbechara</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23janandolan4ssr">#JanAndolan4SSR</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23candle4ssr">#Candle4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforssr">#justiceforssr</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushanthsinghrajput">#sushanthsinghrajput</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23drswamy">#drswamy</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ishkaransinghbhandari">#ishkaransinghbhandari</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23arnabgoswami">#arnabgoswami</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kanganaranaut">#kanganaranaut</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4sushanth">#justice4sushanth</a> <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottallbollywoodgangs">#BoycottallBollywoodgangs</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywoodbrands">#boycottbollywoodbrands</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iujjawaltrivedi">#iujjawaltrivedi</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywoodlobby">#boycottbollywoodlobby</a><br>🇮🇳🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙏🙏🙏🌍
A guy becomes ENGINEER in the FIRST year itself, he learns life, then it is up to him how he takes his life ahead in his &quot;engineering ways&quot;<br><br>Proud to be an engineer myself, my GF (back in 2011) couldn&#39;t marry me because of castism (when you talk about nepotism) - she married someone born brahman not earned brahman :)<br><br>P.S. - Now happy in Norway, this December in snow, around Christmas,  will get married to my present GF from Russia, she is the kindest soul I ever met - I AM GLAD I DID NOT KILL MYSELF MY HEART WAS SOOO MENTALLY BROKE BACK THEN, fuck you castists and nepotists
Don&#39;t bullshit me , this guy won&#39;t do something like a suicide !!! Fuck bollywood
He still didn&#39;t knew how to deal with people 😭
What a treat to listen to him.
hey guys just learnt that  ...huff paranormal vdo was fake he stolen some of his words from this interview...guys if u notice u may get some here and there
How habdsome intelligent person he was 😭 beauty with the brain 😭😭😭😭
SSR would be really sad today, to see what&#39;s going on. RIP Sushant
He is enlightened  .
He was so endearing and at the same time very intelligent. Anupama sometimes looked baffled and quite at a loss.
He is not only actor but genius
Let’s encourage talented actors India...so we can cherish millions of ssrs in future ...so that we can boycott khans,kapoor sand bachans
We miss you sir and we are fighting  for you.
He is a very much  a perfect combination of intelligence, beauty, smartness &amp; education . miss u ❤ 💜 💜 💙 ❤ ❤ 💚 💛 💕
Hmmm...he clearly spoke about Nepotism here
Why they kill such an innocent and pure man. And now maligning him.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=361">6:01</a> it&#39;s happening
सुशांत लव यू.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=649">10:49</a> that&#39;s not funny Anupama..Just that you lack that brain to understand his words..
Anupama Chopra is shamelessly trying to degrade SSR
I know it sounds counter-intuitive but. If ever a film is made on ssr..Rajkumar rao his contemporary could potray him the best
He looks bipolar
Miss u sus
😢😢💔
All of us are hurt as if a part of us take.....why do we feel like this?....tried to analyze it ...and this is what i think...<br>..Why do we like a song?.....because some part of our emotion is related to it....why majority of us cried or carry a tremendous pain in our hearts ?.....its because some part of us is mingled with his life....for a student  ...he is a  genius ...for a ambitious person its his perseverance.....for a poor person he proved that nothing is impossible....we see our self in his life....our struggle to achive inspite of handicapped circumstance...due to this....all of us see a part of ourself in him...that is way we feel that part of our self is taken away...his life is snapped before we could see his full potential  .....part of us is taken away because he was in our shoes and he showed us the way....that nothing is impossible...keep pushing your dreams and inevitably it will be accomplished. ...
I was crying seeing this video of him😭😭😭😭😭
Now SSR is no more, this is not only Bollywood&#39;s loss this is loss of our country. Country lost its brilliant child.
Sushant was so friendly.. can anyone  one see the interviewer sitting style .. feels she&#39;s at home... That&#39;s the charisma of Sushant!❤️❤️
Yes SSR industry is collapsing..... but for that u had to go

Who came here after Sushant interview in Steve huff fraud..
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsingrajput">#justiceforsushantsingrajput</a> .
Steve Huffman used audio in this video and claimed to talk with sushant singh&#39;s spirit. Fake steve, Report his channel
Who is watching 2020 agu
He said it - “the industry collapsing in the near future “(nepotism)
Who is here after sushant sir bodyguard interview.
A genuine human being very down to earth with no airs. He is irreplaceable. God bless you dear Sushant
Sushant there will never be any other Sushant..extremely Intelligent person..so good looking..so good dancer..you are so intellectual actor..your demise brought big pain to me and the whole of India..I was a big fan of you Sushant..You will ever live in our heart..you will always be Loved by all your fans..it is hard to believe that you are not there.
This is man is totally powerful....unique
Dank Rishu bolte
Steff Huff had taken the words from this interview.<br>Samaj rahe ho <br>  <br><br>       By Cringe tik toker Loddy Bhai
Ur talent can&#39;t explain in words brother !really extraordinary mind!!
She tells SSR that we shouldn&#39;t praise you for your in depth study of Dhoni before the film because that&#39;s the job of an actor! Okay, but name me any nepo barbies in Bollywood that puts in even quarter of the work. They don&#39;t have to.<br><br>You know why? Because even if the film flops, they have another film lined up and chutiya people will go and watch the shit. <br><br>Lost a talent. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t so educated on his work thus far. <br>REST IN POWER BHAI.
Steve Huff stolen Sushant voice from this interview!
Sushant is best and this anupama is all negative and asking questions which is showing her negative attitude
oh jesus he was very good at everything and his voice was sooooooooo melodic !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=948">15:48</a> Is bande ki hsi yaar 💔
This Interview was used by Steve Huff to fool Indian Audience😂.<br><br>Or Karo comments ki he said:-<br><br>1) Dipesh Done this<br>2) Dosti ke naam pe they murdered me<br>3) They brought noose<br>4) Kya kare sab dost the<br>5) Big Arguments with men😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>Yaar koi bhi humko bewakoof banata hai.
his words are fortuitous
9.55 She mentioned Sridevi to Sushant....Two introverts, highly talented, extremely intelligent actors, wonderful human beings, very down to earth, extremely fit and died mysteriously...Both didnt get justice. I think people envy such talented beautiful people, and the cabal doesnt want them . Wish the accused of both get caught and punished asap.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=360">6:00</a> He has spoken clearly about nepotism..Dear SSR fans, time to give him justice and bring down all these Nepokids like Khans, Kapoors, Bachchans, etc...down and show them what the common man can do. Stay united like we did for Sadak2...lets make a better ground for stars of future.
Who is here bollywood spy
A very intelligent mind .. ! We could have learnt a lot from him. 🙏 Rest in peace brother... We will keep you alive in our prayers. ❤️
Mokhsaa ke video dekha bhai log😎😎

such a.   captivating smile and magical personality. too pure a soul. He rightly said about nepotism.
Sushhhh 💔💔💔😭😭😭😭
He is saying...&quot;you can die in between &quot;<br>What a co incidence
He talked abt Nepotism 3 years ago only, it&#39;s our mistake of not looking into it!!!<br>😭😭😭
Such a well spoken, well read, well informed, intelligent guy.. star kids who are 10th fail, 12th fail.. obviously wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t understand him..
That steve huff guy stole all those fake spiritual voices from this interview
SSR is love ❤ .. Hate Bullywood
Love u sushi😢
This man was an ocean of knowledge. Whether  its physics or  another topic he had immense  knowledge of  everything. This smile is somehow  vanished. The man  has physically  gone. But will always be in our hearts and minds. Love u  bro RIP sushant bro. Allah  aapko jannat farmaya Ameen 😘🕋🤲🕌
Justice for sushant.
The audio of this interview is miss used and is used in a spirit calling channel and claiming that ssr contacted them😶
Watching after Ms&#39;s retirement and ssr &#39;s death😢<br>Many things have changed in 3 years😢😓
Its so so sad, we will never be able to listen to him anymore in the future. Such an meaningful and intelligent conversation.
Very Miss you SSR ♥️
she is trying all ways to make him feel low and non sense!

How those heartless criminals cd murder SSR...a genius ....soo loving nd kind.....so talented.. our heart really goes for him... v move into tears wenever v listen to him...
Guys, <br>I&#39;m from Amsterdam and literally devasted by SSR sudden demise.<br>I made a short video to tribute to sushant sign rajput.<br>Please like this video and support for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIforSSR</a>.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxGuLpJxMa0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxGuLpJxMa0</a>
Sushant he was Good actor justice for Sushant CBI
Anupama Chopra is one wicked woman. Prove me wrong.
I can&#39;t overcome...though how much I try hard.. but the brutal behaviour of jealous scroundels and greed for money if that bitch Rhea... wouldn&#39;t come in the life of Sushant ..we would have been watching of so many more beautiful movies of Sushant..
# justice for SSR <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbi">#CBI</a> for SSR
Anupama Chopra is such a hypocrite.  She must be shocked by such a intelligent and real person infront of her.  She is used to false and fake people which compliment her stupid personality.<br>She was purposely mean to him..
He has raised a point about nepotism.... He was personally affected ...and he is not in favour of remakes
Very nice actor. Miss you Sushant# No justice no movies.
He is  the inspiration for  all the introvert  people like us.😍
Sushant sing is very intelligent, very honest &amp; at the same time he is very simple in wordings &amp; also in behaviour and there is the cause of mishaps. We have lost him forever.
Challenging for Anupama to finally interview an intelligent intellectual guy. She must miss the chaaploosi she is so used to.
old and frayed actors should have the grace to step aside for younger,dyamic new comers in the film industry....and lend a helping hand  to create a vibrant  industry.
The interviewer Anupama Chopra has really added joy and invested confidence in Sushants.  Can tell from the way his talking and talking alot. She&#39;s enjoying her moment hosting him and so is Shushant.   Wow, what a free spirited man.......RIP man.
&quot;or you will die in between&quot; that hit hard, because apparently 4 later he did.
Great!
Do u know...In NASA, only two actor’s pics are there..one is Tom Hanks from Hollywood and other is Sushant Singh Rajput From Bollywood....SSR was in contact with top 10 scientists in this world. He used to chat with them via email...there are so many good n brilliant things that people don’t know about him....it’s a great great great loss of India...Why in India ,intelligent, talented, good souls persons are not getting recognition, security and respect??? Because of our ignorance we are loosing great people..use your brain..don’t follow these fools from Bollywood and politics....JAGO INDIA JAGO.....Wake up...It’s already too late......
Dear SSR u r perfect..Aise log Kai saalo baad paida hote hai...All rounder... we should protect them .# CBI for SSR ..Dirty people (Shivsena,mcp, bhatt gang,Bollywood mafias.mumbai police etc) are trying to destroy SSR image..please don’t watche any Bollywood movie ..bhatt ki Sadak 2 ka zero income hona chahiye...minus me jana chahiye...now it’s time to clean the Bollywood and Mumbai ...we the people of India  can do altogether..we have so much power in our hands.....
When he quoted &quot;when u know nothing, you say alot. When you say something, what&#39;s there to say &quot; she just couldn&#39;t understand that. She said oh so funny! Dear ma&#39;am it wasn&#39;t funny. It was so deep that u just can&#39;t understand
You will die in between...and Anupama laughs...but now it is so true...life is so unpredictable
Why is she laughing when he&#39;s expressing the truth and his pain!
Oh man I miss this guy so much. He was such a gem 🥺
Does anyone else realize that there is a change in his voice and eyes in his 2018 and 2019 interviews? 2018 was happy and strong. 2019 sounds like he was drugged, medicated and low because of that.
The thing he said about his experiences being more important than having a big role in the film shows how true, pure and an intellectual actor he was
Poor guy seems he knows future die in between relationship..
Plz watch this how sushants Video is misused <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqaoO2Q8Wls">https://youtu.be/PqaoO2Q8Wls</a>
This is the number of people who think Sushant Singh Rajput is murdered and want justice to be served.<br>👇🏻
Lovely boy.Miss him lot
what kind of sick woman is she? look at d way she is sitting. Not giving even a pinch of respect to SSR. shame on you ! this lady is giving immense respect while interviewing to only bollywood so called A listed star.
i like reading but he has inspired me to want to read more.........not just a pretty face but a brilliant mind too.......definitely a rare gem.......ok im done commenting.......but seriously can&#39;t help myself.......which is weird coz i never leave comments on youtube lol but i mean it&#39;s SSR&#39;s interview so just couldn&#39;t help myself
He was so loved even that time, i can feel after reading the comments...... He&#39;ll be loved forever ❤️
has the cutest and most innocent smile ever......also the way he handles some of the negative questions thrown at him just shows how professional and intelligent he is....so calmly handled
no words.........just an amazing person and it is a great loss to this world that he is no more.......

Huff paranormal  n yhi interview ko liya h fake huff 😠
Aupama u literally trolled him in this session. Shame on you. <br>Guys look at her words carefully. She is mocking him in front of himself. <br>Now she is promoting jahnvi Kapoor&#39;s upcoming movie gunjan saxena so intensely. I mean why? Is she really a good or established actor who has proved her skills in the world? Had she ever promoted any of shushant&#39;s movie? No. But she is definitely mocking him here in her so called program. <br>Shame on you. Unsubscribed your channel forever<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#boycottbollywood</a>
😍😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗🤗
Love you❤
she is looking at him sarcastically.....may b I m wrong but it&#39;s been proved that intelligent people are often misunderstood because they are on some other level and people don&#39;t get them....
Who said that u r boring ?nd by not talking to u have a good tym i knw actually who they are ,they r idiots, illiterated who couldnot have match ur IQ 😣😣😥😥😢😭
He Said Then Only If You Not Allow Right Talents Come In Then Whole Industry Will Collapse And It&#39;s Becoming True.
Bollywooed ppl are scared and insecured of anybody who is talented , more intelligent than <a href="http://them.so/">them.So</a> they use their power and money to clip the wings and bring down a budding , talented, intelligent star.Its time we take law in our hands and teach these unjust ppl a lesson.
If Sushant does not get justice,we as Indians can do our bit by protesting against injustice by boycotting all the movies of nepotism products.Dont buy xpensive movie tickets to watch the meaningless Khan, KaranJohar movies.This is d way we should retaliate.Pls everybody, we should join together to protest against injustice,if we all stand united , we can make a huje difference , coz public only make and breaks a movie star, a politician , a political party, We have a lot of power.A population of 130 crores can make a difference we raise our voice against these manipulative bollywood , politicians , the people who are misusing the power and money for unjust activities.
Aditya chopra, salman khan, mahesh bhatt, karan johar <br>Inka time abb hum khatam karenge
see his last interview. you will spot the difference
This person is the most humble sweetest and genuine actor I have ever come across ... he is not just breathing cinema he is an actual successful person in terms of how he thinks ... he could be a great motivational speaker too a great engineer too a person who actually inspires in true sense !!! Lots of love , Sushi
For a self confessed loner.  I am surprised by the friends that are popping up.
I feel so sad now of not following him and did not watch his all interviews. He is no interesting.
He is  so informative and intelligent. So nice to listen to him
I am just like him in character I don&#39;t have that much talent like him but i am very introvert kind of.. Can&#39;t put my thoughts into words.. And sometimes I get out of my character and talk a lot.. And them people find me interesting.. Same as sushant told.. Just happens to me.. I can relate with everything he told.. People actually find me very boring.. Also some people who sometimes used to be my so called friends don&#39;t get their time to call me to their parties.. Exactly my situation and me are just like him..
Very intelligent actor sushant
Bhai Miss you.....i am not going to spend a single rupees on  star kid.....
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO THAT ACTOR IS?  - THE ONE MAAM IS TALKING ABOUT  WHO SAID &quot;HE WILL GO ALL DANIEL D LEWIS ON IT&quot;
Anupama, so fruckingly disgusting I found you in this interview.... Pity people like you....
Anupama chopra is such a nice,warm and comfortable host to talk to...one of the best host in the hindi entertainment industry...she&#39;s  empathetic and is a very good listener
We lost a gem
He is talking about nepotism here
Such a smart intellegent person it breaks my heart to think that he is no more,sad very sad hope he gets justice so dearly missed by all his fans...
He was immensely talented .
He was such an intelligent guy. It&#39;s painful that at times, deep shift in society takes place at the cost of such an innocent life.
Anupama ki shakal dekho raat ki utri nahi hai 😂 all these so called film critics are creepy as fuck

Can this women ask such mediocre &amp; stupid questions to khans or nepo kids? Such fake act... Kudos to sushant for answering her crappy questions so well.
India lost most expensive diamond 😢 💔😢 CBI request for Sushant please please please 🇬🇧 king of India Sushant ,
Such a great actor
Sushant spoke about Nepotism when it wasn&#39;t a hot topic in media or industry
Love u Sushant Sir 💕 u will be remembered.😢

What a great interview
Daniel Day Lewis is from Ranveer Singh, jealous bigots, Guys, we need to mock him down at Kapil Dev, let&#39;s see how this idiot would get good ratings. We need to attack on Ranveer Singh, he has been snatching all his movies
She is trying to demean him at diff places....what kinda intvw is it....i hav watched other inyrvws of her but she is not kinda harsh on others....that cricket thing i dint like
Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people.<br>– Eleanor Roosevelt
May be its just because of the current  circumstances I am feeling this way but I think she is also subtlely mocking him in this interview..
One thing I dont like about Anupama is that whenever she interviews an actor she fakes her laugh so much. It makes me so annoyed.
See Sushant has spoken about nepotism. Industry was very mean to him. Boycott these crooks.
Justice for sushant Singh rajput sir 🙏🙏🙏
So called Bollywood please watch this once

She&#39;s making fun of him being a professional and method actor &amp; laughing stupidly on his  genuine answers
He trying 2 say in his interviews &quot;nepotism&quot; is there
This lady is mad
# We want cbi enquiry for Susant and justice for Susant
Sharp guy, debate should be on mental health issues and not nepotism. Please let his family heal and let him rest in peace. Celebrities milking his death for publicity and media encouraging it is very sad reflection of modern Indian society. RIP Mr Rajput, you will live forever.
He looks depressed here too.  As if there is some vaccuum in his life.  And no amount of worldly happiness can fill it. But he tried acting and in films trying to achieve some satisfaction.  And no amount fulfilled it.  And his spirit remained incomplete .
The problem with our society is that they cannot handle other people&#39;s fame and success.... So unfortunate...<br>The loss and pain felt very personal.
She said sushant is skirt chaser
Introvert creating bikau media to talented outsiders..<br>If he appreciates talented actor like this. No introvert scene is created
Bad journalist
His trust was broken,  his mind was messed with, he was manipulated and harrassed and brought to a point of breakdown. Until it is proven that he did in fact take his own life, or that someone else ended his life. This man deserves the respect.  I hope and pray that the entire truth is uncovered.. the dark underbelly is exposed. Every culprit brought to the book. He was unique and if he left to the US, studied at Stanford.  This guy would have been at the top of his game. India didn&#39;t deserve him.
Anupama its time you ask for CBI enquiry into Sushant Singh rajput death. He sat across you many times . In memory of those times speak and ask for CBI enquiry in his death .
Sushant is great Actor talented Actor justice for sushant noooo one like in Bollywood boycott all Bollywood stars
His smile at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=457">7:37</a>...it&#39;s just worth everything ❤️❤️❤️

People from inside the industry take their roles or work for granted
Boss u r genius<br>21 July 2020
Just after this movie karan johar hired him to teach about nepotism I think because in this interview he talked about nepotism and made his movie release in ott without telling to him .kangana is right pls support her .pls 🙇🙇
Every night I watch over his all interview and feeling sad.
It&#39;s been exactly since he passed away. RIP. I still can&#39;t believe he is no more. <br>Irfan Khan, Rishi Kapoor and now you. 2020 is the worst.
Here&#39;s hoping Bollywood has learnt a lesson from Sushanths case.......not to mingle professional with personal life of individuals ......&amp; most importantly learn to completely ignore malicious rumours doing the rounds.......also conciously embrace the person who is used as a scapegoat to create a rift in interpersonal relations maybe ,by holding meetings with them.....or an evening round of coffe with them .....this is the only way to defeat  their enemies.....showing them ..that barking dogs don&#39;t bite!!!.....&amp; Most importantly being sportive when it comes to professional rivalry.......by giving everyone a fair chance to prove themselves.....Good luck Bollywood...
The interview seems to be biased against Sushant..
Those who still don’t believe listen to his voice in this anupama Chopra interview n this video 👉 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzLgNeoeUeU">https://youtu.be/lzLgNeoeUeU</a>
I HATE ANUPAMA!!!!!!!
I LOVE U SUSHANT BROTHER😔😭
Why He committed suicide?<br>Its Very strange....<br>He Seems intelligent...<br>Sensible...
I can&#39;t express my outpouring love for this talented actor. I never knew I loved you so much. Humble, Polite, Witty (in a good sense), Hardworking and most importantly a good human being. Sushant would never ever die in the hearts of all of us. May his soul rest in peace.
Dear Sushant sometimes or we can say that the conscience of the people of this coutry sways where it is made to sway. Most if the people are artificial, they are not connected. Medeiocracy  is pervading everywhere specifically so in Hindi film Industry
Yar elam paronamal paathutu voice check pana inga vandhinga
Sushant Man , You are a Gem !!! will love you for your truth &amp; being the most courageous. ❤💕😍 Kalakaar badhe auhde vale ho janaab, Ishwar ne queue di aur chal diye. You have created history !!!
&quot;Readers are leaders&quot; and yes even he is no more with us his soul is gonna lead.
After listening to him..I could relate to him and feel the pain of being introvert or in other way (being true and kind hearted)..<br>I am requesting to all people that please don&#39;t strive for all the fake attention that we have created around us.. ( social media, parties, posts...) if you don&#39;t like these things..<br>I know people do things which actually they don&#39;t like..They do it  for other persons..&amp; in return they will be getting ditch if they fail do these or someone does better than them...<br>So please live for yourself &amp; your love ones who really care about you &amp; love you for who actually you are...<br>Most important thing is do what you like to do and love it...&amp; live your life fully without expecting anything from anyone...
He spent 7 month on Paani......
Sure ...i will never spent my money on khan&#39;s movie...Aditya chopra...Karan johar&#39;s...Mahesh bhatt&#39;s.....and all who hares him.
He was today’s handsome and a brilliant actor and will be the best forever
Sushant Singh Rajput is an immortal personality.
SSR miss you
Not able to digest he is not <a href="http://there.so/">there.so</a> intelligent , hardworking ... all in one
Female seems very impressed when ssr talks.bhoomi .sara ali khan .kriti and all i have seen all his female co stars  comfortable .feel <a href="http://secure.so/">secure.so</a> these co stars ladies r really very very good actresses.
See he himself saying...  If film doesn&#39;t work it matters very less to him
Extremely intelligent &amp; sensitive person who really could make huge difference to the world. His genuine goodness reflects clearly....
❤❤❤❤❤
Honest, Simple minded, genuine, true artist
SSR,if you can see us..just want to tell miss you like hell..over n over listening to your talks to see you live...down on Street for you... never going to settle till justice done..

This earth was too shallow for Sushant to live in specially in his profession. I hope you are finally at peace in the world you chose to go. I will miss you very much. Your loss feels very personal. Will keep your memories alive through your movies and stories. It’s not enough but there is no other way. Rest In Peace ✌️💔🙁
Bollywood  is only for 10th  or 12th fail son or daughter  of bollywood  star ,it&#39;s is not for a talented  actor like  sushant,  boycott  star kids promote newcomer

Legend. Most legendary people are only discovered after passing away. Sad, but that is really the truth of it.. Rest in peace, brother in Humanity.
It&#39;s one month.. Sushanth left all of us, all of a sudden.. I&#39;m sure everyone will be missing him. It&#39;s very rare, very few people remain in the hearts of millions, even after their demise.. That shows the character and caliber of that person...... Sorry to everyone if there&#39;s any mistakes in my formation of sentences in English..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=364">6:04</a> I&#39;ve seen this thing on every interview of SSR.
He is ❤❤❤<br>His way of talking is soooo good!!<br>His views on remakes, mindless movies. What he thinks about everything in general is wonderful.👏👏👏<br>You are a present 🙏🙏🙏
Most of the introverts are listener &amp; observer.
I was not his fan, but after Sushanth&#39;s death,My mind is so much scattered and in pain, I m watching his 3 yrs back interviews. We lost a intelligent, sincere, a very good man. His innocent smile makes me  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭.
How intelligent he is missing more much

Kyu Industry kya inake baap se chalati hai? Ye audience ki vajah se chalati hai...<br>Why only Bihar ...as an Indian m boycotting them ( kjo , salman khan, starkids, chatu media,T-Series,YRF in an all bollywood mafia ) too...we have lost such a grt talent Like Sushant sir.. art is pure  n theses are the people destroying it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#justiceforsushantsinghrajput</a> .
He said he has a problem expressing himself but I have not seen anybody express themselves this beautifully. He has literary bared his soul in this interview.
The industry will collapse . So true sush.
I don’t like the interviewer .. she doesn’t know what to say
My role model is not Dhoni but Sushant
Yeh saali faltu aurat hai..
The pain of being introvert.
When he speaks about his relationship a d breakup, he kind of hints what was the reason for their breakup. He loved her, she loved him but he didn&#39;t have time to create those moments they needed to survive. Breaks my heart
It mattered to him that he had less movies and he had to be famous to get movies:(
Love SSR ❤️
even i also never knew i liked him so much
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=706">11:46</a> Or you&#39;ll die in between 💔😭
I am unable to stop myself from thinking about him. I can feel him, really miss him.He was a extremely intelligent, kind and naive person but in bollywood mediocracy survives, hard-working people like him are shunned away. I just want to keep watching him. I hope you have got the peace you were seeking. All the love to you whereever you are !!
May his soul rest in peace🙏🙏
I am sri Lankan living in canada. I wasnt aware of this AMAZING MAN. Tis is the only interview tat has given this BEAUTIFUL MAN all the space to pour out his mind..<br><br>Can clearly see for 1 simple question this beautiful man has sòoooooooooooooooooo many ways to answer.. ohhh i am so in love with his intellect....
Bradley full paani films
Boycott nepotism and star kids an old actor
This women is idiotic and shameless what she is asking
We miss you lot sushant sir ur voice, smile ur acting😢😢😔
His smile is full of innocence 😍💜
I just love this interview. Have been watching it almost on repeat. What a lovely human being he was.<br>I love the way Anupama Chopra helped him open up, the expression in her eyes as she listened to him talk about his deepest thoughts and feelings.<br>And I agree with him. People need to listen more. Our generation is forgetting how to do that.
All the Jealous people in industry just forgot that he was a gem and everyone in bollywood wanted money from us but Shushant wanted to actually give something to us that would actually make sense. He was very different from others i can only understand now that how difficult it must have been for him to actually fit in the bollywood because he never belonged there. He was sharp/intellegent/sharp/simple who wanted to work on soemthing different than the usual. I cannot beleive we have lost this beautiful soul. All makes sense now that how he must have been feeling all these years and I saw other interviews about Drive going to release but that never happened they intentionally put it on hold although Dubbing was already in the very early of 2018 and it was released on 2020..Paani is now mentioned in 2016 which is 3 years and some months and they stopped it in between. Well Pandemeic taught each one of us many things hence please dont go for any movie and watch them because they are of no worth. I hate them all now..
You don&#39;t know much about cricket, and to top off she shoots herself in the foot &quot; Some one said he will do a Daniel Day ufff. You are dumb A. Is she on critical interview  I didn&#39;t like her interview
He didnt kill himself. He was getting roles. And high profile interviews. Once anupama interviews u that means u have made it big.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=666">11:06</a> the part that the whole world wants to know.
Love u brother forever💖💖💖💖.you r safe in our hearts....💖💖💖
I will not loose you Once again. You are safe in our heart SUSHANT  ❤️ You are an inspiration. Thank you so much for everything.

He was the only actor, I used to follow on Instagram, now Instagram has lost meaning for me
@11.51  Anupama in total awe of This Gem
Sushant is speaking so honestly in this interview bringing out his flaws.When he said he doesnt have any friends and no one wants to talk to him,the interviewer laughed ,she could have sympathised and advised him in this regard.He looked very sad and helpless.She could not see  his pain.
Crying and watching his all videos and interviews 😭
who the fuck she is to pass judgement?  She should ask questions only and not to slate her opinion. No one want to know what shit she believes, she should have basic decency to let guest express. you are over doing grandma
i m big fan of anupama  madam , n  SSR  is really great actor
Sushant 😢 😭😭😭😭😭😭
He is taking about nepotism in flim  <br>Industry
🙏🙏🙏
I think Sushant and John has lots of similarities in intelligence of person , they think as common person but John Abraham is mentally strong and so so awareness of Politics of industry

Sushant talking such good things... N Wat she talk... Beauty products in heros.... Fake laughs... I was thinking like chup jihads.... Her other interviews she never laughed that loud..... I think she took money to make the interview funny not inspiring. ...
Maa ke na hotey hue bhi usne apni sabhi ichhaayein poori ki aur jab kuchh aur karne ko na raha to chala gaya sab chhor ke. Jitna usne 15 saalo mey paaya doosra koi poori zindgi nahi pa sakta. Hum log kya karte hein khate aur sote hein. Kitni yaadein chhor gaya hamare liye kitne interviews, dances and movies. Sqami vivekanand bhi jaldi chale gaye unko hum aaj bhi yaad karte hein sushant ko bhi hum tab tak yaad karenge jab tak ye duniya chalegi

Common..justice for Sushant... He was murdered... Throw Salman n all idiots out of Bollywood.. I don&#39;t even mind burning them.alive if Sushant can be brought back😭
I don&#39;t know how many of you have noticed but I have seen series of Sushant&#39;s interviews but he does make references to dying or death somehow. Ckh 18.57 in this vid too..... Apperantly it is there in his subconscious since a long time
Anupama Chopra another bitcg
FILM Companion, do me a favour, Do promote the outsiders coz the insiders have themselves to promote themselves.  We wld like to support the ousiders for their talents. Thank you!
He is a SURVIVOR, I say. He is not bothered about NEPOTISM and he knows how to handle it. This is clear to show that someone murdered him!!He is too good for BH.
I never felt  such pain for any other actor...  will never forget  you  Sushant ... 😔🙏❤️💐you will always be in our hearts... 😪

He is not for this hypocritic, shameless, double faced bollywood. He is way refined, decent, talented.
The way she is sitting shows her respect to our hero Sushant Singh Rajput.
Supper Sushant RIP
Payal ji, your comments on Sushant untimely demise is perfect.. From 14th June to till today I&#39;m unable to come to terms with the fact that he&#39;s no more.. Your comments I have saved and when I&#39;m very much depressed and think about Sushant, it gives me little relief.. Thanks again Payal ji..
a way more intelectual, innocent, kind, smart , intelligent Human  He is one of a kind❤️. wish we can bring him back💔😭
Tears, come back Sushant please
When I look back, I found Sushant led a very normal life.. Especially when he entered film industry, ge did everything required to be in the industry.. Smoke  drink, parties, attending premiers, giving interviews, losing his cool sometimes, photo shoot, was in a live in relationships, had girl friend,planning to produce a film, signed a few films as an actor, had a good bank balance, that&#39;s what we came to know.. Inspite of all these, there lived a person who people called introvert. He himself admitted he&#39;s one, but led a very very lonely life. Why Sushant, why..?
Why this person haunts me day and night.. One of friend with whom I shared my feelings about Sushant, he said.. Are you mad. He&#39;s gone forever.. Don&#39;t think about him. Still I&#39;m unable to accept his untimely demise.. I used to be a big Hindi movies fan. All of a sudden I lost interest.. I wonder how a single person can bring so much change. Is my behavior is normal or I&#39;m reacting a little too much. I&#39;m confused. As one of the viewers who watched this interview rightly said.. Ge touched millions of heart in a very short period of time.. I lost both my parents and every morning I pray for their peace wherever they are. Now I pray for Sushant also. Wherever he&#39;s let him be in peace..
I am going to follow any starkid  ... I won&#39;t watch any of their movies.. I hope ... My love for SSR is more than  unfairness of SSR.. dear GOD plz give Indians the power to fight for right.
you were too thoughtful in everysense
Amazing human 💟💟
Communication is still a problem for desi star specifically in English...they become extremely excited to meet up the speed...<br>Sushant was superb...he prepared himself
Anupama chopra is bitch of Bollywood. She licks the shoes of star kids.
Came to see SSR!
Anupama Chopra wife of Viddhu Vinod Chopra! <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottfurthervideos">#Boycottfurthervideos</a>
What he said about not having anything original was actually insightful. He was not trying to be funny and actually noticed when she laughed. lol.
Anupana is little more happy to interview nepo dumbs.
&quot;I liked reading, ppl find me boring, I don&#39;t like talking that much I don&#39;t have many friends,&quot; this is a perfect description of me, people used to and still find me boring because my idea of fun is so different from most others&#39; ideas of fun. There&#39;s no right or wrong anybody can have fun the way they want to. RIP Sushant 💫
Can&#39;t stop reading everything about Sushant.Following details about his <a href="http://death.one/">death.One</a> death I&#39;m finding difficult to come to terms with.A shooting star shot down?
A fabulous and spontaneous actor.<br>A man of integrity.<br>He had the potential to  reach Hollywood and win an OSCAR.<br>Legends are IMMORTAL.
We lost the gem...we r going to boycott these bollywood
Have you viewers noticed. Throughout the interview, Sushant was changing his position and position very frequently.. Something was bothering him, whether the questions or the person opposite to him or don&#39;t know what, but it was clear. He was not comfortable..
Bas Dil karta hai tumhe Dekhte rahun
You know this Carona atmosphere is blessings in disguise for people like us. You know how? Sushant left.. But left behind these big influential people and star kids of Bollywood who can&#39;t survive without hypocrisy and don&#39;t know when their films will start releasing in theaters, forget OTT.. By that time all their ego and false illusions about themselves will be shattered, atleast that&#39;s what I hope.. If there&#39;s anything called Divine justice, indirectly Sushant will teach these bastards a lesson even in his absence.. RIP Sushant..
Please, we want justice for Sushant 🙏🙏🙏
He was a real RAJPUT... A king... Lived with bravness... A real genius... I love him so much... Rest in peace
Bhai is banda jesa koi nhi tha
Iss sali ne.   hmare shushant
Bc chopra
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=183">3:03</a> Anupama you are fake, Look at Sushant he smiled but he didn&#39;t liked what you did
Excellent conversation by ssr n anchor  also very genuine person.
The more you know, the more you know you don’t know...
miss u sir 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
Im sorry you saying youre not a fan of  cricket or you would ask who the cricketer is i mean what??!! you&#39;re a journalist not somebodys wife here chatting <br>In your home youre taking an interview of an actor madam it was not necessary or needed you were kind of demotivating the person whos acting for it sure you could have said it in a put together manner if you wanted to Ms Anupama that was a bit foolish from you and i can feel you&#39;re being sarcastic towards him which was not needed how cunning and jealous people can be for talented people NOT acceptable
This going extreme, In India Arvind Kejriwal is an outsider. Nepotism in not in bollywood.. Narendra Modi zamana is old school.
Such a legend he was..he is ...he will be ♥️you&#39;ll allways be my favourite untill my last breath..we love u thats all
Miss you sushant❤
Very very intelligent &amp; it shows in every word he spoke.
I knew him more after death<br>and loved him soo much <br>What i do now he died 😢<br>me very sad for you 💔💔
He explained everything about nepotism and his worries. We all should have paid attention to it. Even though that is not the reason he passed away because he was clearly murdered.
we have created a network on Instagram and we are fulfilling all 37/50 unfulfilled dreams of Sushant.  the name of the page is @fulfilling_dreams_of_sushant
Man I can listen to you all day long. You are making perfect sense. But world is not fair. Or I don&#39;t know what to expect from the world Or what you were expecting from the world. I can only say that you were lovely, charming, intelligent and so much more. RIP dear
I can relate so much, everytime I want to say some deep shit in a comment, only half way into it I feel like its loosing its meaning. Language doesn&#39;t help sometimes specially when you want to speak your brains. I hope I made some sense.
Such a hardworking and gentlemanly , educated person. We have lost national treasure. It is bringing tears to my eyes and wishing he was still alive and moving and talking like this again
I will find peace in the fact that big stars lived 60+ years in the industry producing pile of crap, and you did a few very good films and kind of lived more than those stars. The regret will remain though, that there could be so many more masterpieces as you would grow! What we can do, as a partial justice, is to now choose wisely whom and what to watch.. over bright polished looking plasticity or real artists and their art. You will be loved and remembered.
It&#39;s really very sad watching his interview and thinking he is not there with us. So tragic. We will miss u Sushant.
Sushant singh rajput best actor
sush: i read<br>her: what do you do for fun?<br>me: <b>have you ever READ ANYTHING?</b>
Such a brilliant person😭😭😭😭love u soo much sushant😔😔😔😔❤️
It&#39;s so clear everything about him by this interview ..so deep thinker and so well he think about his work and enjoy do much that he excel in everything he does ..I think he does not wanted to lost in this mediocre talent this bollywood have.....such a big loss for indian cinema ...they are busy doing useless sequel and remake only ...instead if they nurture such talent then only this industry can go further else it eventually collapse
Read the book &quot;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#39;t Stop Talking&quot; by Susan Cain. This tendency to make fun of introverts is very damaging to them. &quot;What do you do for fun, Sushant?&quot; asks AC. Here is a voracious reader, his idea of fun is being by himself, learning new stuff, reading. Why is partying the only way to have fun? Why is being garrulous seen as a positive trait? Our society needs to value the capabilities of their introverts. They are often deep thinkers. They are not superficial. Unfortunately for Sushant, he was probably surrounded by people very different from himself in the film industry and possibly very shallow folks. It can get very lonely when people around you don&#39;t get you.<br><br>The Dunning-Kruger effect is also at play here. The hallmark of intelligence, according to the psychologist Dunning, is being “good at knowing what we don’t know.” Sushant was highly intelligent, while the people around him in the industry did not know what they did not know and therefore felt very superior. Unfortunately we live in an age when mediocrity is worshipped.    <br>:(
Anupama just an observation u seem to know what was going on with him though u put it across very midly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=716">11:56</a> “It will not be forever, or you will die, it’s a fact.” That hits different now 😢
2020 is the most horrible year
Is it just me or does Anupama seem antagonistic to Sushant. I have seen many of her interviews and this one feels so weird and it seems like she has some dislike for him.
Realstar
How talented he was.....<br>You will be remembered ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23alwaysaliveinourhearts">#alwaysaliveinourhearts</a>
We always miss you sir😢😭❤️<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantform">#justiceforsushantform</a>
Lessons from the last few interviews I have watched of him----not to be analytical..he looks at things without judging....he says here also that he watched Dhoni play without <a href="http://analysing.in/">analysing.in</a> another interview,he had said &quot;science says when one watches a movie with pen paper to review and as audienece,two different experiences&quot;<br>---he says KNOWING CODING WOULD BE LIKE KNOWING MATHS AFTER A FEW YEARS...<br>---he says very few people listen...or they pretend to listen..<br>--
This world will never be the same without you Sushant <br>Love you from all my heart 💓 Return if possible?
He has a problem expressing himself... Hes an introvert n was left alone around fakes like kriti rhea etc.... His one decision of breaking up with ankita was worst.. She is the only one who could understand him support him the way he wanted...<br>Hes too intelligent n over thinker which makes him Confused.. N lost in his own thoughts... He has problem communicating with people.
Rest in a More Peaceful Realm Sushant... You are now One with the Universe, Beautiful Soul♥️💔
Hey Sushant! Isn&#39;t it strange? When the people have started forgetting you, I have actually started missing you. Was never your fan before but this interview felt like my own. I won&#39;t question that why you ended your life because I am actually aware about how it feels. But there is an another window to look at the situation, why am I thinking over and over again that for you death was not an escape plan but actually a new platform for the entire new world. You didn&#39;t killed yourself, I guess you just realized that this body of flesh and bones won&#39;t suffice your true purpose. 2 hours sleep man? That&#39;s awesome, I am working for it but am not on a perfect track. Maybe someday we will sit together and discuss about the books we read. Pleasure listening to you man. Stay blessed 🤟
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3hTyfuRuwQ">https://youtu.be/t3hTyfuRuwQ</a><br>SSR FANS, Lets watch this video ❤☝️
I am also very introvert Susant... I love your smile always and can match something with you which happened in my life ❤😘😘😘miss you in very bad way😞
🙏
Omg he said @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=720">12:00</a> maybe you will die in between .. and AC laughed.. assuming that is never gonna happen.. little we know !
Why is he so restless - usually people can sit calmly in one place! Just wonder!
What’s ironic is that he’s the most interesting person I have seen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=364">6:04</a> apt explanation of when mediocrity and nepotism can be harmful to the industry. Maybe this is why digital consumption has increased so much nowadays.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=170">2:50</a> Being compared to Daniel Day Lewis is a big compliment. The joke&#39;s on you (whoever &#39;mocked&#39; him)
Such a lovely soul.
All of us are. Very Aggrieved
Everytime I watch this guy I wonder if India will get another like him😭😭😭😭
I am so great full that we have all these interviews and films to watch and continue watching to celebrate Sushant’s legacy. There is no denying of the fact from this interview that he was already hurting and yet he stayed so gracious in his interviews. Sushant was a “Beautiful mind” 💜
Boycott the non talented elites in Bollywood
This video says it all , it can be an evidence in court against the Karan johars of Bollywood
She has a black heart...She&#39;s clearly bullying him...At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=320">5:20</a>  she&#39;s happy about it...Great Anupama you are going to hell..
Can feel how an introvert feels when he or she cnt share his or her feelings like an extrovert  person can do...
Beautiful beautiful beautiful soul intellect soul but lost himself in this world soul was lost in his journey nothing was done for his life soul lost everything he was too much in movies and outside world time was wasted in his journey from Kenya
The Bollywood will collapse soon he was right.
Bollywood is not for gems like soul actors, Sushant Singh. But sadly people will still watch the likes of alia, varun, the khan&#39;s daughter or sons, n anyone else who gets paparazzi love.
I won&#39;t say he is not alive.He is living in our hearts and would continue to inspire us. Soul doesn&#39;t die and such beautiful souls can never leave us. I would always love you. Sushant you would not be missed because you&#39;re living in our hearts.😘😘
Zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nahin...yehi sikhaya Sushant ne
He doesn&#39;t seem sorry about having broken up with Ankita. If lack of time was a problem, why did he give Kriti a chance? Now, I wonder, if he was in fact dating Rhea then, why did he send her and others away when they were there to &quot;listen&quot;.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t seem to realize the difference between his anxious self here vs. the calm self on the TV sets. Maybe he would have appreciated Ankita more. Wonder why his demeanor changed so much. Was it the medium of communication or the pressure of movies? <br><br>He was full of contradictions- so fascinating.
He was such a pure person. Much love brother. Respect to you
Shining smile with lots of thinking.....<br>Missed u....how much? I can&#39;t explain.....if u did suicide (though I didn&#39;t believe)than write something for us....why u did so.....<br>These people try their best to make u psychologically weak......<br>Believe me ,God will punish them more painfully than they deserve,only for their lie.....and for our prayer..... believe me.....you are a super hero, you will be super 🌟.....you are all that we want from Bollywood.....<br>These Bollywood people can break our heart,can play with us,can block us ....so why don&#39;t we boycott them....
2 hours of sleep?
He was a threat for so called Bollywood mafia gang.. They were getting frustrated that they can&#39;t stop him..That&#39;s why he was killed... See.. We..the admire of this Nobel man💔 will get justice.. We shall go in any extend... It&#39;s my promise!!
Sushant u are one of the most intellectual person having tremendous thinking frame in mind in entire bollywood.
You said you were living your 4-5.30 life. Why did you lost hope bro? :(
I think it&#39;s time to STOP watching and admiring so called heroes ...all Khan&#39;s, Karan Johar,Ranveer singh
He is TOO intelligent..way beyond, a deep thinker, a good human, empathetic etc.<br>Nepotism killed his soul...Fame and money doesn&#39;t drive him. He was too burdened with everything..
Na krty tu yeh aisa na hota...they never like him just make fun of him ...kash k tum kisi ki parwa na krty..
As he said in last minute that they also don&#39;t want to talk to me shows how alone he is in the Bollywood industry.
He does seem quite uneasy / depressed. It is evident in his speech, expressions and body language. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=175">2:55</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=650">10:50</a> - she mentioned it twice to him that people mocked him for his hard work and dedication...and perhaps avoided him? Did he make it to that round table? Maybe they avoided him because he reminded them of their shortcomings. It is unfortunate that he was made to feel bad about his strengths.  <br><br>Such people who put their heart and soul into their work and are talented and hardworking - when they don&#39;t receive the right opportunities and recognition and are discouraged - it breaks them.<br><br>Also, maybe he had high expectations for his professional life and couldn&#39;t take it well when reality didn&#39;t match the expectations. <br><br>His breakup could also be the cause of this depression.
RIP Sushanth😶
Such an awesome actor and good soul. He will be missed. I hope you get the well deserved peace that you were seeking  desperately, brother.
Miss youuuuu
I didn&#39;t even watch his movies (except Dhoni) nor followed him on Instagram, Twitter or his career. But his death has caused so much pain in my heart - not sure why 💔 RIP Sushant 🙏

He was murdered. Marks on neck is  in circle in the middle and suicide marks are in U shape near the neck. There is also black mark on eyes and forehead on left side. Along with red marks on arms. Stop calling it suicide. We need CBI inquiry justice for SSR!

Unsubscribe this fraud. She writes malicious things about Sushant Singh Rajput.
Chopra also made some nasty comment on Twitter about Sushant. She couldn&#39;t even take his name and call him Rajput and said he wanted to go quietly so we must be quiet....basically in effect she wants to silence people from discussing the Bolly mafia which she and her husband are part and parcel of. Don&#39;t watch stuff from this Chopra woman either.
all of his wisdom n meaningful words u can find here
ill watch byomkesh
Such a beautiful Mind
Well honestly the vibes Sushant and Anupama had was so deep, meaningful and intelligent. They understood each other at levels. Industry needs more of these kind of people so that no more sushant type of guy will go away from the world being depressed.
He was soo intelligent and brilliant.
Nothing lasts forever. You may die in between 💔
Lots of love for Sushant ❤️
Sushant lookd so vulnerable here that&#39;s why bollywood was able to kill him.  All those fake vicious blind items by Rajeev Masand must have took a toll on him. He bullied him for 5 years continuously,  what a vulture Rajeev Masand amd media turned out to be. Rajeev Masand must be charged with defamation case. He should be investigated to know why he did that to Sushant.  Was he paid or did that out of hatred?  Shame on Rajeev Masand!
I loved byomkesh! It was a great movie ..
Innocent talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=1050">17:30</a>- He reads and calls it fun and that&#39;s why people found him boring
&quot;What do you do for fun&quot;? What a silly question you lady...<br>Who are you after all..I find you too irritating in this interview.<br>RIP Sush...
Still mourning SSR😔💔💔💔💔<br>😔 SSR 💖💔.... I regret wasting my time on Ranveer Singh... I should have followed SSR 😔.... regrets... SSR was too good to be true... no one knew how to handle his genius...from this moment on I will not spend money on Ranveer Varun Alia KaranJo YRF Kareena Saif SRK Salman etc...<br>I also regret not following Irrfan while he was alive... 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔<br>I was a fool.... no more ... SSR death will not go to waste...
This interview broke my<br>heart. Made me realize he and I are lot alike.  All he wanted in life was some  good friends l, and good work so can continue act. Which be loved to do.
yaar...heera hai larka (crying)
There hasn&#39;t been a day I have not shed tears for him. I feel so guilty for not having appreciated him enough when he was amongst us. Like many here, I too feel a sense of personal loss. Every single day my heart gets a little heavier.
The more you watch him speaking his mind out, the more you see how enlightened and realistic he was and the &quot;claim&quot; that he ended his life seems a distant action a mind and personality like him would take end all his struggles. RIP Sush (your fan from Egypt)
I am a Pakistani but to be true I really adore this guy&#39;s intellect and manners. Far ahead of his other Bollywood counterparts in the way he thinks about things. Truly a gem &amp; a great actor lost too soon to frustration &amp; nepotism 💔
This video is like putting a microscope into Sushant&#39;s brain! Anupama asked amazing questions and that&#39;s why we can cherish this video even after he&#39;s gone. What an incredible guy! I really relate to him because even I can&#39;t articulate my thoughts into words very easily. Gone too soon, SSR 🙏
I still can&#39;t believe that he had committed suicide. You had so much to do for the world....why did you do this Sushant ????🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 Can&#39;t still get over the loss.
*Read it Once and Think about it Twice *<br><br>Suicide or Murder? <br><br>1. When a person hang himself to death, the ligature mark comes above the thyroid cartilage or some time over it or the mark has a tendency of giving an upward impression but if you remember that viral photo of SSR the mark was too circular and that also  below the thyroid cartilage. That can happen only during ligature strangulation( tightening of some band around the neck without the body  weight) and that is only possible when someone tie something to your neck from back and tries to choke you off .<br><br>2. If he has hung himself then how can his eyes remain closed because in maximum cases like this when a person hang himself to death his eye balls become bulging?<br><br>3. On that particular object there is the finger print of his left hand&#39;s three fingers only but he was not a lefty, then how can he  tie a knot using only his left hand??? <br>This is only possible if someone is trying to choke you off by tying something to your neck from back and you are pulling it may be with your less used left hand only when may be your right hand is hold or pressed or kept tied by that same person. <br><br>4. How come the duplicate keys goes missing when that is the house of a celebrity and he can any time lock his room   while leaving but the servant may have to open the room for cleaning or any such purpose?<br><br>5. On 14th June afternoon and evening all news channel were relating his death with his secretary Disha&#39;s death but suddenly broadcasting of that news was completely stopped and the total focus of the audience was shifted towards Nepotism. <br>Was this intentional?  Did somebody bribed all the news channels? <br><br>6. According to some news and posts he and his secretary already invested some money and started planning for a net series few months back when he realised that many of his films are being taken off from him. <br>How can a person with such positive attitude ( which is proved from many other videos) decide to end his life? <br><br>5. Last night before his death some of his friends came to his house and neighbours heard the noise and even in the morning he met and talked with some of his neighbours and there was no change in his behavior .<br><br>6. Where is his Viscera Report? <br>For most of these doubted suicide case viscera tests are also conducted then why not in his case? Even on the first day news channels were showing that the body will go for both post mortem and viscera test. But the viscera report never came out. Even  according to news, post mortem report was telling that his death was due to asphyxia ( suffocation) no where the time of death was mentioned. Suffocation can occur in any way like if somebody tries to choke you off. <br><br>7. All the victim of Nepotism are sharing their experience may be just to burst out their anger and hence we all are hyping with Nepotism. And may be this act of us is saving the original culprits, our mind is getting diverted from getting justice towards boycotting this, that production house. <br>May be the culprits want to divert our mind coz they know punishment of nepotism will be maximum banning of their films for few months and that will not change anything of their life but if it is proved to be murder then may be their life will end. <br><br>Other than these many other things are also coming up in the social media. <br><br>So please rise up, our first priority should be justice for SSR and not only stopping Nepotism. <br><br>Those who feel it, please share it,  on every social media platforms, as I am not into any other social media. Because if we all rise up together it will surely reach upto the higher level. We, the common people can do many things, if we are together. So plz share it.

Most of the question that are been asked my the interviewer is strictly prohibited for the mighty actors. I have never seen in her interviews where she&#39;s been telling the other mighty actors that they shouldn&#39;t be appreciated bcoz it&#39;s their job. Seriously
Anupama made actor sushant come out of the real sushant....he may seem not affected by criticism ...but he is affected by those criticism like anormal human being ...this interview tells us a whole lot of story why he is no more with us....because intelligent people overthink ....
Sushant.....hum aapko bhoolenge nahi.
I hate this Bollywood now .Earlier I loved this world but Don&#39;t know why Alia, Varun are treated better than him.Such a star we have lost...Don&#39;t know why i have lost respect for all these. May this intelligent man have his bit of Success in the next birth.
Oh god! You can feel so much in this video
He was preparing for &quot;Paani&quot; with Shekhar Kapoor in 2016, yet &#39;they&#39; snatched the film away from him and probably so many other films. Never forget, never forgive :)
I don&#39;t know how I watched your harsh critical conversations and critiquing technique. I didn&#39;t enjoy or feel comfortable watching or listening to your work but today I as a viewer will no longer follow you or heed your feedback/ response. It&#39;s just my opinion and it&#39;s my decision.
If you&#39;ll give it to me, i&#39;ll keep it!<br><br>He is superbly constant. Always speaking the same thing.
Agar yeh insan logo ko boring lagta tha to honestly kitne bade chutiya hain.. Itni deep baatein karne wala samajh ne wala insan sab ko boring lage barwad ho gaye ho
Intelligent people and introverts suffers with overthinking .need to work on it
I feel like she is the only interviewer to fully grasp his brilliance and understand him. He was so lively and unabashedly in his element here. It still hurts. We miss you legend!
I saw love and affection in Anupama&#39;s eyes!!
Liar liar pants on fire
This lady seems to be the only genuine anchor &amp; journalist.👍<br><br>Mam, I request you to please name those morons &amp; idiots, who used to talk rubbish &amp; negative about Sushant. We want to give back to these morons😠<br><br>This guy Sushant was extraordinary and shouldn&#39;t be in this shit industry, working with morons.<br><br>Please Boycott each and every movie, shows, ads &amp; products featuring &amp; promoted by nepotism products &amp; byproducts or associated products/byproducts and let us try our level best to bring them on road, literally😠<br><br>Remember, they make money, because we watch them, so stop watching these morons😠<br><br>Please don&#39;t forget death of Sushant, even after years &amp; years🙏<br><br>Don&#39;t forget this case ever🙏<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushantsinghrajput">#SushantSinghRajput</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23anupamachopra">#AnupamaChopra</a>
😥😥
Wow! What shallow people! If he reads, he is boring. If he drinks and parties, he is happening. Even Anupama Chopra asked him what he does for fun. Really?! Please don&#39;t try to correct me saying things like he &#39;was&#39; and &#39;he is no more&#39;.
He seems to be struggling to clearly explain. His thoughts were so deep that even his own words and other persons couldn’t capture it. <br><br>It is more of a loss of science than of Bollywood.
THEY DONT WANT TO TALK TO ME.. hmmm
This interview now makes so much sense.. I literally feel like puking in Bollywood.. they slowly sucked the life out of him... a beautiful soul:( jahil log and I don’t find anything off about what he was saying but in this interview u begin to see he is getting sad.. what a sad place if he was with engineers, doctor, in NASA he would’ve been cherished but he was isolated as he was threat at many levels... I wish he had connected with his fans.. beautiful soul I hope u have rest now.. if u knew so many have been upset after u r gone
Guys, you will never get to know the truth about Sushant Singh Rajput&#39;s death, because Yash Raj Films, Karan Johar, Salman Khan, Ekta Kapoor  and T-Series and other big banners, will not let the truth come out. They supress weak people, they want to rule bollywood.  We will not get answers, the only thing you can do to change the future of bollywood is, to support new and talented people, who are deserving. Don&#39;t watch Ekta Kapoor&#39;s serials, Yash Raj movies, Karan Johar movies, Salman Khan movies. This will be justice to Sushant!
I seriously miss you now darling. 💔💔 I did rather date someone who is more smart and reads more. What the hell do u get by partying and drinking? He was right. I love you so much darling Sushant.❤
Such a handsome man and that beautiful smile..
Sushant was a brilliant actor.Down to earth person he spoke about Nepotism and due all this he is no more to give  good films for <a href="http://us.rest/">us.Rest</a> in peace Sushant🙏
Now it is in our hand plz we need to give Justice to our beloved Sushant ❤<br>PLZ BOYCOTT <br>Karan johar<br>Salman Khan <br>Ekta Kapoor <br>YRF<br>Nepotism
Madam, I have noticed you interacted with sushant many times and I am able to understand sushant more by watching your interviews with him... And I believe that he cannot do suicide.. He was murdered .I urge yu to take little initiative to prove that he can&#39;t do suicide.. it will be a wonderful tribute to him..🙏
Sushant is not happy,he is talking about his lonelyness.I am so <a href="http://sad.rip/">sad.RIP</a>
Your very intelligent that&#39;s great may God bless you
She thinks he&#39;s kidding, but actually he wasn&#39;t. If I had seen this before, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that this would be the result one day. You can see his expressions, body language, everything, his tone when he speaks, his words, he was honest. Nobody just thought he was serious.
7 months he worked for Pani...
He said it right, other actors are self-obsessed. Bollywood didn&#39;t deserve him, he was too good for it. And he knwe something that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t speak much.
look at my intellectual, well read, inquisitive kid. I would die for him. He was a gem. so brilliant and rare. <br>Shushant was many things but not a quitter. Somebody clearly killed him cause he was capable of doing far greater things in his life. <br>My heart hurts so much right now. I just still cannot bring myself into terms with this heartbreaking reality.Such a bright smart intelligent precious pure brilliant shinning star gone in this tragic way is unacceptable for me. I hope and pray that wherever he is, he is in PEACE. Ameen!
Industry didn’t deserve it. Clearly, epitome of intelligence at wrong place. I really wish he lived more.
The world lost a gem of a person! His talent, intelligence, and kindness are unmatchable! I hope he is at peace and his bullies will be punished!
After watching this vdo I really have found resonance in Irrfan Khan and Sushant&#39;s thinking style and so connected but still so apart... my dear you will always be remembered as an honest soul with so much of intellectual.... as u well said .... see u on the other side ... love forever
Sushi you voice is just wow.
How could he say people find him boring? Not everyone would. 😔 Maybe there are too many shallow and dumb people in Bollywood. But there are many of us in the world who DONT find books or intelligence boring. I hate that being so smart and awesome he said these self deprecating words like &quot;people find me boring&quot;. I admire him to bits but I so wish he had been more unapologetic about being who he is.
It was completely planned murder.... If he hanged himself so why his eyes and tongue is in normal condition when he died.... think think think... It&#39;s a planned murder and everyone was involved in this murder... 🥺🥺🥺 He was the real hero in this industry.... who struggled so hard but nepotism is there in Bollywood...
We lost most talented , smart and thoughtful   person 😭RIP Sushi 💐💐💐 Love you 😘😘😘😘You will always stay in our ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹 the place will not be the same without youuu miss you 🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Our public is blind, we cannot differentiate between good people and bad people. Idiot Alia Bhatt has 48 million followers on instagram whereas the well deserving, very talented Manoj Bajpai has only 1 million followers. We run after glamour, and don&#39;t value sweet, innocent, intelligent, kind people. Don&#39;t run after fake glamour, value talented, kind, innocent, sweet people. I request 🌷
We miss you so badly Sushant🙏
She is so fake... pretending not to understand him. Alas if only she realised she was talking to an extraordinary genius.
He sleeps for only 2hrs ...He has anxiety issues that&#39;s why ,may be ...He was in rush or hurry of some sort as if he knew ,he doesn&#39;t have time ...Thus, when he feel ,...he is wasting his time on something ...He quits it ...He had a hyperactive brain ..Which needs rest and now is at ...<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rip">#RIP</a>💓
Bollywood isn&#39;t fortunate enough to have such an HONEST actor like u.
The movies in which he worked that hard didn&#39;t do on box office and movies like judwaa 2 and dabang 3 with zero content thrive .....harsh reality of bollywood and nepotism
Very honest boy, he was trying to be so honest all the time.. Plus he was thoughtful and very intelligent, this much is more than enough to cause trouble when you are among the masses..  he loved acting but he was not fit for world of daily actors.. he was not a daily actor!!
my dear you was the best
We as human beings, are at peace and attracted to truth. Sushant has a decency and honesty to him. Bollywood hurt him. Painful knowing he isn&#39;t here.
i guess he is the only one with the talent and knowledge whether its an art, science, occult or social.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmLrgYM2q-E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmLrgYM2q-E</a> (Tribute to Sushanth Singh Rajput)
Ignorance is bliss sometimes dont be over intelligent 😷
He used to sleep only for 2-3 .. in my opinion. . this damaged  him more than anything else ..
Wisdom overloaded. RIP Sush !!!!!
Quit watching yrf nd karan johar movies  ,only way to pay this gem a tribute
Whyyyy whyyyy Sushant??? You had such a beautiful ahead, your intelligence was enough to live a great life and not get caught into the ugliness that Bollywood was all about...!!
I dont like that cheap deepika  always behind super rich guys finally found rich businessman son, who lied about being outsider ,money what matters for them
It&#39;s really heart breaking to know how much pain he was in and there was no one who helped him ... We as a community are messing a very vital part in us to let this happen soo many time. <br>Rest in peace Sushant, gems like you deserve all the happiness in the world.
I remember watching this interview three years ago, and rewatched this today...he was such a brilliant, honest, pure soul. RIP.
my heart jst broke when a talent like him said &#39;m happy people are still hiring me&#39;
Damn intelligent and brilliant Sushant why you leave so soon omg so sad 😥 😥 may your soul rest in peace 💔😢😢 om Shanti 🕉️🙏
Bloody nepotistic Bollywood biggies were jealous of you Sushant. You will always be in my heart. I would have loved to talk to you, hammered or not.... God grant u peace and justice.
Its not he didn&#39;t wanted to work with others no-one wanted to work with him, because of his talent.  she is twisting someone&#39;s word. Garbage lady.
The host absolutely did not react the way she should have to his humility.
How Anupama set on the sofa ,that shows no respect to the person who is set before her.
I loved loved loved loved him in PK 😭😭😭😭
He was innocent and smart but he was  vulnerable .
He is killing me 😥😥
Miss you dear Sushant ...You always been an inspiration! Sometimes things which are unsaid speaks more than words...!!!
Seems like he was depressed all along
Highly intelligent<br>Highly sensitive<br>Highly articulated<br>Highly talented <br>And these bollywood creeps <br>Know he is too good for them <br>This bloddy Anupama has no calibre to interview this genius
Watch from 3.0 <br>Watch this idiotic lady Anupama asking him <br>Are u embarrassed that ur intelligence is mocked..<br>Lol.. u dumb ass lady.. someone who is intelligent should only feel proud of the fact tht dumb people will mock him
Horrible interviewer.
After watching many of his interviews, I came to the conclusion that he might have had Aspergers. Asperger people are very intelligent but lack in social skills, so they mostly imitate others to fit in. He said in one of his interviews that he was <b>acting</b> all his life. They also have difficulties to fall or stay asleep because their brain is working nonstop. Many Aspergers suffer from depression later in life because they have to make sense of this world which they don’t fit in and many don’t get diagnosed in their early lives and receive no therapies.
even in this interview one can make out how disturbed he was.<br>His body language is sort of confusion no matching with his tongue.
Pure soul.....😪
People just don&#39;t listen 🙂
Amit you said the Right things .i think they all shoulda be in Jail so they knows how to take a Life of are person very nicely look work hard in his life .so iam sayings put 5 of them in jail i ask god to put them in jail ..😲 we 💘 mr. Ssingh life poor his familys. All .in pain .god bless them .
We lost a fucking gem. Seriously. He would’ve matured into something unbelievable.
I came here for Sushant and I didn&#39;t know this interviewer(sorry for lack of my knowledge), and I stumbled upon his 2 interviews with her.. She is really pretty.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=817">13:37</a> My my.. she has a beautiful smile..!<br>And would add, I always liked him, wish I had communicated that to him once..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=391">6:31</a> mark.. comment on nepotism.. Brilliant
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=1108">18:28</a> 💔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=172">2:52</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=360">6:00</a>
9.15 - 10.50.....that&#39;s me...blows my mind😓
Really such an interesting person, We miss u Sushant 💔
I admire his talent and all that he is as an individual rising from the bottom to the top, but if nepotism is practice in India or in Bollywood, then should market himself to different aspect of acting. Like for example, he can start a business that markets himself, like modeling or go back to school and finish his degree. Or relocate himself somewhere. Depression can be fight off, if you have will power to do so.
What a fantastic personality,real intellectual humble, hard working person who bollywood could not understand as there is no one person like him in the industry
In this interview also sushanth talked about Nepotism... So that I understood he tried as much as he could survive in this BOLLYWOOD shit...Finally he can&#39;t 😧😭😭😭😭 MISSYOUSSR
Really great actor. RIP
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=258">4:18</a> he is so nervous...i can see his innocence so lonely he must have been...
Wish I knew him
Bhgwaaan ke yaha der h andher nhi✨jisne jaisa kiyaa h uske sath der se he sahi bura to hoga he🌸Miss yaa... Sushant .....
A lovely and pure hearted person
This is so sad that as an international audience I am disgusted at the way Bollywood doesn&#39;t recognize talent
Shocked,stunned,devastated.
Love you Sushant Singh Rajput..will never forget you in my lifetime..will watch your movies ,interviews,segments a million times in order to make you immortal..it is not easy to wipe out talents like you from our hearts so easily.<br>You will live forever..I promise..
Talks about nepotism : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=360">6:00</a> <br><br><br>Your welcome 😅
Every single interview I am coming across of him... I can actually observe  his body language and see how restless he always is.. always thinking about and have excitement to do something. He can&#39;t stay still he is that into it, enjoying it!
My take....<br>ART and SCIENCE all rolled into one person in the correct proportion!But somehow the CHEMICALS in him went out of balance! What a pity...a beautiful life with everything ended so tragically !<br>RIP Sushant....you were one of my favourites! Perhaps you wanted to travel in Time.....this is the real &#39;Untold Story&#39; !

Study is his fun
Bless you Sushant ❤️✨💫🙏🦋
Yeah that world is fake.. People are fake...
This interview will clearly tell u that why did he suicide.. Specially he clearly mentioned... He was such a hardworking guy man..jab ap itni mehnat karo or recognition na mile...only few people can understand wht was he going through.. He was gem❤
People do not listen, Preparation, emergence is mocked at, people do not like me, they find me boring, people do not want to talk to me. <br>Why was I only listening to that.
Kyun bhai ? The people who made you like this will be definitely punished someday brutally 😡😡. You are always alive in our hearts sushant ♥️♥️♥️♥️ you are natural star and kind hearted ♥️
Oh my god.. Those last lines.. I may have found them funny but now they make me wanna cry.. I promise ill support upcoming new talent as much as possible.. Movies like byomkesh bakshi and sonchiriya.. There is nothing left but regret.. M not used to go to theatre.. Last movie i watched was bahubali the conclusion.. Everybody talking about how overrrated starkids are and how underrated good actors are.. But we all forget that we r the ones rating them..
this interview best anupma pls. share ur thought how sushant
It was not funny when He said &quot;people who don&#39;t know nothing talk much bcoz if they know whats there to talk&quot; rather it was inspiring. Just because u can speak english a bit fluent than others and is occupying a priviledge status doesn&#39;t mean you can say &quot;It&#39;s so funny&quot; to someone&#39;s taught process. Don&#39;t mind but Anupama Chopra ur interview itself is a personification  of how Sushant was mocked and boycotted in the Industry, Why coz i have seen ur other interviews too but never felt an inch of taunting and sardonic tone in ur words that are coming out of your priviledged mouth in this particular interview.☺️🙏👍
look at his eyes..buddies
Miss you Sushant sir 😭 😭😭😭🙏❤️🙏🙏🙏
Bollywood jealous from sushant
I paused the video in between. Cannot see such a wonderful person being in  severe anxiety and depression. <br>One lesson I would like to teach is that, excellence is not to be mocked but to be appreciated.
So Humble &amp; Down to Earth he was, a Quality which is rare to see in an Newcomer becoming A-Lister, unlike others who after gaining Success change a lot. 😭 His Passing away is highly unfair.
He is so sensitive I can see it in his eyes,  everything he speak is from his heart.. can&#39;t believe the fact that he is no more :((
At 3.05 ,I can see pain in his eyes and an artificial smile...You are such a genuine soul♥️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=1109">18:29</a> The truth in his voice as it goes soft...
I&#39;m going to keep him alive in my memories by just watching all these videos. I don&#39;t want to believe that he died. So rare that you find a man so intelligent, humble, and unique. Rest in peace Sushant, I hope your soul finds happiness in your next life.
He choosed red pill
I request u all 🙏 plz support talent. Kisi bhi kalakar ko superstar hum bnate h to plz ab se hum superstar use bnayenge jo deserving h jo talented h. To save talents like sushant Singh rajput we have to support talent.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ripsushantsinghrajput">#ripsushantsinghrajput</a> <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23supporttalent">#supporttalent</a> <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23request">#request</a>
Sushant seems like anxious in this interview and many others. And his accent doesn’t come off natural either. It shows he wasn’t very comfortable being interviewed and doing things others actors did. although his acting is great, it does seem like he had a hard time fitting in, which is not his fault.
I&#39;m crying right now, Sushant. You&#39;ll be missed. You tore us up like anything.
He is so good in his thoughts and saying that he would fit in any job. <br><br>These persons are unique, and God need them early, why?
Fuck you @karanjohar and @yrf films. We love you Sushant. May your soul rest in peace! 💔💔💔💔
Sushant Singh Rajput you were GEM OF A PERSON! Forever in our hearts! Love you! 💔
Anupama thank yo for treating him well and listening to him.
06.05 he speaks abt nepotism
Poor soul..so much he said reflects how much he was left to feel lonely. You should have just turned to us buddy...hope you have found peace and happiness now
OMG, more I watch his interviews more I am falling in love with Sushant.
THEY ALSO DON&#39;T WANT TO TALK TO ME.. THAY ALL WANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME... 😭😭😭
This is so authentic and real. And bollywood is so fake, hypocrite and nepotism.
He touched lives and inspired people. The mind is a powerful thing and once a thought takes hold, everything else fades out......... the interview is a reflection of so many processes and information being processed in his brain at the same time. Clearly reflects the desperation he had, to do multiple things in life. He wished for uncertainty and excitement in life. somehow not able to grasp the fact that man who was so ready for uncertainty in life couldn&#39;t handle his recent life period.
His hard work can clearly be seen from his tremendous body transformation to an intellectually speaking and presentable persona. Just look at the way he is answering all the questions. On the other hand some of these so called nepotism factory products don&#39;t even know how and what to say in public. Hadn&#39;t he took his own life he would&#39;ve been a tremendous asset to the country as well as to this double standard showbiz industry. We&#39;ve lost a gem, I really liked how he portrayed ms dhoni. His hardwork can be seen very clearly in each and every shot of the movie and his work in kedarnath and chichhorey was absolutely perfect and enjoyable. 34 is no age to go. May he get the peace in his afterlife. Om shanti shanti.
Rip
God bless his soul... May he finds peace ....
I got Goosebumps at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ENv3Vy716o&amp;t=716">11:56</a> when he said &quot; You May Die in between &quot;
I love you my brother ......
Can we have him back please 💔
Such a clarity and independent thoughts ,his passion love eagerness ....y yaar y y u did this ,u should have alive,u deserve long life
See his face, how people can hate him? Bro really miss u♥️RIP
I didn’t know him personally, but somehow it really hurts to see such intelligent and intellectual human being leave the world so early. It feels like we all knew him like a friend next door 💔💔 RIP god needs your wisdom in heaven.
Shashat was intelligent  handsome he had everything a great artist had to  have   . Being an  honest artist  was tuned  on to being highly successful  but sensitive  with emotion . Wicket people  took advantage.  God bless him always
💔💔
Sorry sushant hum log aapke liye kuch nahi kar paye, but ab aise gande logo ki movie kabhi nahi dekhenge, promise karte h aapse
RIP💔😭 brother...Gone so soon.🙏
I love you Sushant you are a great actor and very honest may your soul Rest in Peace . 🙏
Why i didn&#39;t see this video before he was such pure soul. May be thats why big actors would envy him. Miss you Shushant. THANKS FC.
Most people  didn&#39;t  watch his long interviews  till death...The audience  and these &#39;gossip&#39; reporter are so attuned  to shallow  talk,fake expressions, cheap stunts all around  that they  never  expected  or bothered  to find depth  in a actor... Talk about  education by a Bollywood  actor  just doesn&#39;t  make sense  to anyone. Look at sheer struggle  of the interviewer  to understand  what he actually  talking  about.His death is not just about depression...Time to reflect as audience  and bring some value system.
We have to boycott those people who hve boycott ed him
‘... at one level that’s given that’s your role  we shouldn’t be applauding you , you worked for a role but we do...’ umm Interesting I wonder if applied to others so called ‘Bollywood actors’ just saying ...
💔💔😭😭💐🙏
