Logon ki whjah se hi aap famous huye ho aur aaj v unki whjah se hi famous ho...phir v inka pass itna attitude...
Fans agaar kutta jaisa ho to stars kya karenga
After looking at these attitudes if i get a chance  to click selfie with my  best celebrity i won&#39;t even make a try for it . Inke paas selfie khichna matlab Insult ko invitation dena .
Kyu jaate ho randiyo ke paas selfie lene
ARE BHAGOO IN CHUTEYOO KO]
These people have lost their self respect, why are these people disturbing them? If you call celebrity an egoistic then you are also responsible for it. But in India people are mad about celebrities. Running after them like dogs, on the other hand they don&#39;t care who the hell you are😅
People should understand that these celebrities are human and respect their privacy.
I don&#39;t really blame those &quot;Celebrities&quot; ...I blame those PPL who somehow believe that their worth can only be amplified and displayed to the world if they can showcase a selfie with some known personality even if it costs them their self respect <br>..<br><br>Shame
Teri galti hai bhai teri kya lagti hai bhai woh tere liye usne kiya kya hai tu selfie lene ke liye mare jaa raha hai... Jaa ghar jaa kar apne asli celebrity jo tere maa baap hai unke saath selfie le... Unko unki space de do...Inn pagalo ke piche tu pagal matt ho bhai...har koi sushant nahi hai...
Celebrities have their own privacy. Respect that. They are also humans
I have seen only Sonu Sood, the true gentleman besides being an actor
They lead a disgusting life and we are responsible for this making them God or Goddess
Saali ka na sakal na surat
Don’t understand why people want selfie with these so called film celebrities 😂
Aisa hi hona chahiya tum logo k sath q k tum logo main self respect hi nahi hay
&quot;Unbelievable attitude&quot; vs &quot;Simple selfie&quot; 😂 She has the right to refuse - simple selfie ho difficult selfie
Log itnay pagal hai.kash kisi shaheed ki family ko izzat day do
Mad people taking selfie with drunkenyard 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AsYT0NiBt8&amp;t=390">6:30</a> who was she?
Agar aisa nahi karenge log sir pe bethainge
Begamjan
Etna kya sar sar kar rhi hai..salman konsa Bhagwan hai
Abe bhosdi ke reporter tum log kya insan ho sharm Nahin hai tumhen
Fans are just mad for these celebrities. But celebrities do their job. Earn from them and then ignore them.
So what she is not wrong they need some privacy that they don&#39;t get it they have every right to have privacy they human after all sorry to say reporters fan sometimes they are irritating very irritating I don&#39;t blame karreena and just because she stands for her right doesn&#39;t mean you make her drunken make her face as it&#39;s on this post have some decency grow up..I support every celebrities in this video enough of public constantly they are on them give them space and privacy
Who is she ?? I don&#39;t know . Why giving so impotance
It is Castrouphobic when so many people come from all sides and especially for female celebrities... It is a threat
People are so obsessed with selfies that they forget celebrities also need privacy.... This girl shouting for Salman Khan.... Someone is promoting her to shout loudly..... <br><br>Then this video will leak and then social media will term the stars bad
They are also tiered  . They are not always in mood to smile take selfie etc ..stop making them look cruel by putting that music in background.
Fan woh g@@n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23u">#u</a> hota hai jo apni poori zindagi celebrities ke peeche laaindi kuttey ki tarah bhaag bhaag ke bita deta hai ....khud apni life mein kuch achieve nahi kar pata ...bas ek keere ki tarah celebs ka p@@d soongh soongh kar ek din marr jata hai
Public kitni ajib behave krti hai ek selfie jaise unki life set ho jaegi unko job lag jaegi shadi ho jaegi aisaa behave kr rahi hain
Kisi ke private space me gusoge toh gali toh khaoge hi
Pagal public
Ye dubai ma ma jis hotel ma km krta tha wahn bethi rhi mery samny many dekha takh nai isko
That&#39;s the normal response from a human. <br>I would have slapped them in face instead.
Ye sab doo koori k loog h jinky pichy tum bagty hoo selfie lene k lia
OMG. She looks like Emily Blunt. Wth. Change my mind
Ma&#39;am...<br>Ma&#39;am...<br>Ma&#39;am...<br>सारा श्रेय घृणित पापराज़ी को जाता है जो इन घटिया महिलाओं को लोकप्रिय बनाते हैं   😡
I don’t why people are still interested to take pictures with such type of actors lol
Logo ko is ruthless idiots ke saath selfie lene ki inta kyu utsukta hae?? Arey yaar apne doston ke saath 100 selfies le lo, apne family aur friends ke saath khoob sara photo sessions karo aur social media par post karo… these Bollywood poop are so rude and arrogant!!! Still yeh log mare ja rahe har photo ke liye
Taking a selfie with our loved one&#39;s is more memorable in life than with a person who doesn&#39;t care. 🙏
Abd to apni gaa.... Marate ho inke peeche pad ke inki aukaat kya h
Itni footage Dene ka hi nahi na ..
I hate kareena kapoor is an idt
💩
I hate people&#39;s.  Why follow to her. Kuch kam nahin hea kya

They are all begging from the fans to live
Are boycott karo celebraties ko, 1 din mai akal ah jayegi.
Your papa is your hero and mom herione, take a picture with them. That is a best thing in world ❤🐼
Ye log khud hi apni insult karwate hai wo bolte thodi na hai ke humare piche aao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t2O5tJzOmLY">https://youtube.com/shorts/t2O5tJzOmLY?feature=share</a> <br>Kareena kapoor playing game at home
I dont blame kareena ...the one who wants a selfie with her is stupid .....iske sath selfie koi qutiya hi lega ...doesent deserves even slightest of attention ...
Control accha hai medam ka samjh ne wale samjh gaye hoge
Waiting for 5 hours..To tere ko kisne bola tha behn ki 5 ghnte barbad kr en nakli hero ke lie.. Kabhi 5 ghnte bhagwan ka naam lia ja 1 ghnta bhi ma baap ke pair dbaye, ja kabhi 5 ghnte travel krke Bhagat Singh ja Rajguru jaise Asli hero ke janam asthan pr Jane ka plan bhi kia.. Aisa hi hona chaihe tum jaise logo ke sath jo en ghatia insano ko bhagwan man lete hai..
🤮🤮
these actors think themselves gods
western actors are much more appreciative of their fans,humble and willing to take a selfie unlike there eastern counter parts🌎
Cheeeee
Karina tumhe koi hindhu ladka nehi mila keyaa
Chat lo uske per chutiya k 😡😡bewkufo ko celebrity bna rkha hai gwar janta ne

En madrchod logo ke pichhe q baghte ho tum jaise chutiya log
since when did having boundaries and privacy become an &quot;attitude&quot;?
Kyu itna bhaav dene ka yaar in log ko?
सितारे भी इंसान होते हैं दोस्तों, वो इस गोला में रेस्ट करने आये हैं इसलिए उनको परेशान मत करो

Ye log ko kiyo itna value dete ho Bhai Sahab Agar Selfie lena hai ton Scientists ka lo  army ka lo ye log asli Hero Hai.
I don&#39;t find any fault of Kareena..when ppl will understand that your self esteem is in your own hand..Doesn&#39;t matter even how big are they  why beg for selfies??.We love to watch movies ,get entertained after long hectic work .That&#39;s it..Put a full stop there...
Ye to peakkad he
Public is god for celebrities
Bhai magar galat hai log jarasa bhi nhi samaj the hai or phone kabi camra lekr aage aa jate hai galti bhai glt hai
We should stop giving attention to bollywood celebrities <br>Why to give so much attention to them.let them walk alone dont be so excited to meet them
Selfie kyu lena h?stars nahi h yeh...kaise look aur logo ko chote log aur tum log kitna bhav dete ho kyu
Any Hindu woman who names her son Taimur..... I cannot say here what I think of that woman, but I&#39;m sure you can guess.
This was so wrong. Film stars are also human. It was rude and disgusting  that selfie guy behaved... Jumping in front taking selfie , without so mush so as if you please. <br>I admire Karina&#39;s restraint in this situation
Tum log in logo Ko ignore kyu nahi karte. ye kya bhagwan hai.apni self-respect rakho.
Salman did the right thing
Village fellow who bought a new phone 📱
First she saw the face and decided against it
Yeh iteam hain
अपना आत्मसम्मान खुद रखना चाहिए। किसी नाचनेवालो,नकल करने वालो को इतना भी मत पूजो जिसके वो लायक नही।
Ese privacy chaiye warna film promotion ke vakt to bohot uchalte hai tab kaha jati hai privacy , <br>Matlabi log
Look how carefully she is walking ki kahi gir na jau wese bhi halak Tak pi Lia hai 🤣🤣
Mumbai is full of chapri type public getting mad about this bhands...&quot; Sir please one pic&quot;..
Actually we should blame ourselves. How would your life change if you get a selfie with them or even if you don&#39;t get....

This is where your respect triples for superstars like swargeey Sri Puneeth Rajkumar saab who used to treat fans like his family members. Free food for fans at his place, respectful behavior, having a meal with them, standing patiently for hours together to give pictures to fans.. despite being massive star himself. RIP power star ji. Miss you sir
Yar public kitni chu hai. Mai to ghas na dalu kisiko. Who am I to make someone uncomfortable and then say ki i am a big fan.
Paparazzi have jobs so that&#39;s fine but, regular people should keep it to movies only. Stop treating these rich sluts as queens.
Thumbnail Mai to lag raha hai jaise ki ganja pi liya hai 😂🤣🤣
Sanjay dutt ne bilkul thik kya he 🥳
Woh log jyada respect ki wajah se upar ja raha he isliye actors or actress ko jyada attitude mat do 😎 aisa kam karo ki dunya tumhare saath photo kheeche 🤟😎
So bad Don&#39;t run behind them I feel very bad for that girl so insulting 😡 Salman have no manners yr🤦
Inko puchta kaun hai 🤣🤣
Why u people even bother to talk to these type of actors.. These actors are not even bother today where they are it&#39;s just of people. So guys grow up yar....

Cons of being famous.bhai why bother them ? how will you feel you come drunk out of a bar and the entire media and the nation is watching you? Privacy is required

Take the selfie with our Indian army soldiers and farmers who are feeding and saving us in the form of parents. They are the real hero and avoid taking pics of these idiot actor and actress.

That&#39;s why I started liking BTS
Sanjay dutt to sahi tarike se pesh aya rahe thy logo ne hi tang kia tha, unho ne to kaha tha ek ek karke. Par log rasta rok ke baith gye.
Kitney sale inferiority complex se bhare hue hai , ek foto ke lea kaise bhik mang rahe hai. Salo ye ko jhansi ki rani hai jo itna importance de rakhi hai , tum chutio ki vajay se hi to ye apne app ko bada samj rahe hai.
Faltu giri hai ye... Unka bhi life hai... Jo kare... Har time thodi media k samne aaye...sahi kiya... Jo kiya...agar gatal kiya wo shoot karo... Parsenal. Kuch nahi
Yee stars log kya asman se uthre hai kya itna attitude 😏
The editor editing this like an Indian serial bruh 💀
It&#39;s a harassment for stars! People are wrong esp. being too close to lady stars.
सबसे बड़ा हीरो बाप होता है।
Karena is not ready for a selfie 🤳 why should somebody troll for this small little thing..... don&#39;t have any clue
Kyu Bhagte Ho Inke Pichhe Ye Bhagwan Thodi Na Hai , Agar Bhagawan Hote To Tum Hai Inhe Milne Ki Zroorur Hi Nahi Hoti . . .<br>    NAALRAYAN HI STYA HAI AUR KUCH NAHI KYA AUR KHUCH BHI NAHI . . .<br>   OM Namah shivaya . . .<br>      HARI OM NAMAH SHIVAYA . . .
Classic Desi editing... Epic!!! 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️👏 But A hole actors in the public eye should understand the meaning of a fanatic... And having one or many is a blessing .. so humble urself
Mera to koi favourite actor hi nhi h or na hi kise ki fan hu Inka profession h ye that&#39;s it
People are crazy dying to take selfie with theses crap bollywood actors
Ek selfi kae liyae kisi ko kyu pareshan kartae hoo.koun kaisae mood mae rahta pata nahee.
Kareena kya boli?.....
Imagine how annoying it is to live their life. It&#39;s terribly complicated.
I wonder sometimes ppl standing outside their houses, wanting r dying to take selfie. Man ur wasting ur time &amp; efforts on nonsense. <br>Get a life.
Bollywood is a waste of anybody&#39;s time honestly.
Kyu inn harami  zqleel aurato kae peechae bhaagte ho
Its not about selfie everyone need some  Privacy
that was legit dangerous for Sanjay dutt but if he pushes someone back then make it a big deal. jhanvi was uncomfy but she cannot express it? what nonsense is this
oh yes, they are public property. how dare they refuse a selfie or not allow a complete stranger get into their space. they do not deserve their alone time or a bad mood.
In bhdwo k sath kya selfi lete ho y to dle h apke ma bhn beteyon ko bhi noch khayn kmine ,hrame shefale khan kuta nhi ka.
Samajh nhi ata ye log photo khich KR achar dalenge Kya suna to hoga hi jise jitna respect doge wo tumhe utna hi disrespect krega ye log hmara entertainment krwane k liye h inke hi inhe paise milte h tumhare sath photo khichwane k liye nhi smjhe kuch😏
Druggywood
What I see is<br>I can’t just see the people bothering the celebs.they have right to live their private life<br>Kitna pareshan hona parta hai yaar ek celeb hoker bhi.Log Sukoon se jeene Nahi dete selfie selfie khabar me lekar jayenge kya Saare selfies and <a href="http://all.ye/">all.ye</a> sab govt ki taraf se ban hona chahiye.
They are zero without audience. Log kyu piche bhagte h in bewkoofo k.
Guys dont waste your time to taking these kind of stupid things... Why the society gave too much importance to these Celebrities? I feel shame on that man..
I didn&#39;t like public always click celebraties if they are drunk and going to shopping 😡
BGM 😂😂😂😂
samne se pata chal rha h ki saste nashe kr rkhe h kareena mam ne 🤪😱
These kind of videos to be restricted from YouTube.<br><br>Unnecessary making someone feel bad and making money from these kind of videos is not applicable.
Ok but..... Why that Indian serial effects? 😅
Kyu jate ye sb kutte kutti ke sath selfie lene aisa hi hoga nahh woh sb khudko bade bhagwan sochte he me samajhti hu meri ped ki jhuti
Bruh she getting uncomfortable as she is intoxicated people can&#39;t live and let live
Selfie can be misused. Good she didn&#39;t give the selfie.
How can threaten the driver 😡
Indian some people are fool
Shit why you people treating them like a God..?!<br>they are just human beings. Moreover they are down to you. Because of you they become popular, without fans they are nothing..😏😏
Both are husband wife so bad as well as cheap
Jitne reporters iske pichhe pade hai usse jada BB 15 winner ke peeche pade hai<br>But she is amazing❤️
It’s all good having an opinion on this until you realise that you’re watching a video filmed by a guy that was doing the exact same thing and invading peoples space!

Public inko star bnati h or inka attitude dekho shitttt
to be honest this is insane, these people cant be taking pictures with everyone,
Every human has their own right to reject something which they dont like always... Arre selfie lene se pahle puchna to chaiye...
The actors not know that due to fans they r there
what thy re gonna do with these selfies🤔
Kitny chippu kisam k fan hain
Spit these bloody film stars why do u even value them
Yar kuch to चल rha hoga करीना और सैफ के बीच मे इसलिए गुस्सा है वो दोनों
Hm log hi Inka attitude bdate he ....are kya zarurat he inko intna response Dene ka
The thumbnail horribly exaggerates her face making her look like she&#39;s stoned.. She doesn&#39;t look that drunk at all in the actual video..  also.. she has the right to her privacy when she feels like it.. clickbait video..
Bollywood सड़ चुका है ! South Indian actors ही अच्छे होते है आजकल ...
People made them like this.. so it is payback....fault of common people
It’s not nice to take selfies and uploading no use
These people are like...they dont Have any respect fr themselves..
She is drank so leave it...<br>Raste pe kitane pade hote hai pike
They are drunk  karena and another girl
Is this the mentality of people in India. Just saying. Why they worship actors and actresses like gods. Lol... they also just human. 😅😅🤣🤣
In Bhando ko dekhne ke liye pata ni log kyu pagala hai itne
Aisa lag raha hai dono nasha kar ke bahir nikli hai 😂
Public hi ku important deti h in logo ko jo itna attitude ajata h
In actors par kisliye attitude hain .....yeh jo actors bhi hain sab ham logo k bajese hain kyuki hum hi log inki movie bagera dekhte hain.....
Ye bhi to selfie lene k liye pagal ho rhe h
They should think that without us they are nothing
B*tch wtf is wrong with the music😭😭it is just a selfie
After taking drugs
They have the right to refuse. They are common people like we. Celebrities ka naam badnam mat karo na... Don&#39;t be jeleus just be happy and thankfull. All celebraties are very good😊 but those fans are bad🙄 who does not understand them.. please try to understand them..
I don&#39;t think she gave attitude... And if she did what&#39;s the prblm? If u know she is drunk her eyes are red how much she is stressed out and u are going there to beg for selfie it&#39;s your fault
That&#39;s why i don&#39;t take any of the celebrate seriously 😂😂😂
bro what attitude, will you let any one take selfie when your drunk
Kya bebkoof ladki hai plz plz plz sir kya kr logi ek pic leke eske sath tera ghar ni chalata hai ye or teri saari needs ye poori ni krta jo tu beg kr rahi hai eske samne Shame on you
Meri jaan hai karina use koi paresan nhi krega nhi to fir anjam bura hoga press walo
What if ur family in that situation without knowing will u post or if u know also will u post so better support then insulting other
U know what they r human like us...like sometime our mood is bad their mood also be bad sometimes if u can&#39;t help ur industries then don&#39;t make them as a joke ok and u YouTuber u will get more likes.and comment if u show reality better then making other as a joke
They are also human wat u expect in such situation anyone will get fuvkd up
Aise logo ke piche kyun log pagal hote hai inmein insaaniyat kaha hai
Why the FK am I watching this shit
Don’t go behind such fake hero and heroines ! Go behind the real hero JESUS who shed blood for our sins ! These people are not God , they are just humans ! They are no way special , if we stop watching their movies they are no one !
Shit music
We see these people&#39;s movies and these people become superstars.  If we people show attitude and stop seeing their movies, these people will become रोडपती.
Worst part is this media page that shows as if it&#39;s so wrong
Tumlog keise kutto k trh krte ho <br>Jbki tumlog ka koi value nhi deta ye log
Like she didn&#39;t really misbehave in anyway <br>Like refusing for a selfie doesn&#39;t make her the bad guy !! <br>And she looks tired and exhausted too so just let it slide please <br>They are human too
They fello does not diserve this much respect
Bollywood is a sickness
Ye koun se log hote h jinko apne self-respect ka koi khayal nhi hota aur kyu hi bhagna hota h inlog ke pichhe..
Itna ghamand 🙄
Thank Ishwar 🙏 for giving me brain,Thank Allah 🤲 for giving me brain,Thank Jesus for giving me brain 🤝 so I could understand that all idols and celebrities are normal human beings.
Silly fans😑😑
Bhai maan raha hu kareena ne pe rakhi thi lekin behaviour kuch galat nahi kiya bhae.polite behaviour thaa unka<br><br>Or selfie lene ka bhi tarika hota hai. respectfully jaakar jo kaam ho sakhta hai waha bhasad krne ka koi zarurat nhi hai.
Log aapni begati karwate hy khud are wo log hamary waje se females hoty hy or ghamand dekho me to samne hi dekhu too vi na jaw 😡😡😡😡
Theyhv right fr personal space and time... they r also humans.. ppl r really gojn crazy wd mobiles... idiots
Ye ladki pagal hai kya jo 1 pic ke liye 5 ghante ruki aur itna beg kar rahi hai.... really sad hw much our youth is delusional and stsa hav gone down so much
Ganja phuke title likha ha kya aur music daru pike diya ha kya
Why the hell you want selfie with them .. leave them alone
Taking selfies is so personal.  Give these people their privacy.  They have every right to be rude.  One must ask respectfully and if they say no than respect it.
People shd not care abt them that&#39;s when they vl call n click pics..they r not real hero&#39;s..teal hero&#39;s t the ones who leave their family and love to save and serve the country..don&#39;t know when people will realise that
Ufff zada atitude dekha rhe ha
I don&#39;t get why ppl r so mad at them? Even if they&#39;re, atleast show them some respect by asking fr a selfie.
I don&#39;t like her because of her attitude not only this video she is
Suaro ke peeche kyo bhaag rahe ho ,paiso ke liye for u tube uploading.wo hum se hi hai.apni kadra khud nhi karoge to wo kya khaak karenge.
ab wo bhawan nahi hai  pagal ho rahe ho photo ke lye
We feel quite uncomfy if a random person comes and asks for a picture. So they are free to feel uncomfy and get out of the crowd
Chutiya log hote hai selfie Lene wale😂
South indian 🌟 is best
🐸🐸🐸
,🤮 kitni gandi lag rahi hai kareena
Unki marji wo selfie k liye agree ho ya na ho....Bina matlab doosre ki lyf me q interfare karte h...Kitna irritating lagta hoga
Jo eaise in logoke aage pichhe ghumte hain wahi log sala param madarchod hote hain...wo log film ka actor he bas koi bhagwan nehi hain....sala un logoko bi free jinedo....
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺itne bhao khate h ye log to log jate q h hero sbke sath pic lene h kaun ye😡😡😡😡mi to dekh k v kvi n jau
Sab ke sab bakwas hai saale🤬🤬
For fuck sake she is ALOUD to feel<br>Like please not today!! Like imagine hats your life everywhere everyone wants to take pictures and you have to keep smiling! I don’t have to smile all the time or have people hate adding me for pics! I don’t want that life it’s sad she is aloud to have a break.
Rip thumbnail
If selfie is not possible then people start capturing celebrities&#39;  walking style, sitting in car etc. 🙄But why? 🤔 Many of their pics available on internet, daily  Bollywood entertainment videos available on different channels 🙄🙄 Internet ki duniya ne itni mehnat q😜😜
Beawaro ko tumlog itna pagal kyu rahete ho
Kon hai ye log kaha se ate hai chutiyo ki fauj selfi ke liye mar rahe hai..
atey jatey tang karna zururi hai . jahilo
Why u take this bollywood as ur inspiration n role model...think about Swami Vivekananda n other legend of our india...🙏
Vese i dont like kareena personality overall but decensy slefie air cameraman walo ko honi chahiye
Tabhi pata chalta hai south acters aur bollywood actors ke bich kitna antar hai<br>South acters apne fans ke liye kya kya karte hai
I don&#39;t know the before and the after but I can always say that disturbing a person at his or her private hour is one of the the most obnoxious things on earth.
What a b*<b>****</b>

People sometimes behave like *ickheads. Give them some space idiots
Idk why but i am laughing
Jinko selfie chaiye wo pagal hai na. <br>Ek selfie unka phone mein aajane se kya hojyega
Only if some random guy pops infront or beside of this selfie taker’s wife or sister or mom and start taking selfie with them , then only he’ll realise how other women feels when they show such behaviour

Jo dikha rehi ho na wo chutiyapa hi hai<br>Itna kyun marr rehi ho won logon keliye thoda space toh banta hai na <br>Tum log forcefully unke sath selfie Lena chahoge aur wo kuchh bol denge toh unko aise dikha rehi ho
People deify these actors, forgetting they are also humans and it can be irritating for actors as well, continously being asked for selfies everywhere they go. It&#39;s offending for fans as well when  celebraties refuse to acknowledge them. So, people appreciate their art and work, but don&#39;t go crazy behind them because it&#39;s going to give you nothing in reality nor their recognition, nor money, nor their status...nothing.
honestly i respect those actress because they are also normal people not like alien so they also have rights to refuse the selfies <br>kareena was just too tired<br>so never judge those actress
in chutiya logon ke wajah se in logon ke bhav badeh rahte hai, bollywood ki khabar dekh lagta hai communism laga do desh me aur in logon ko labor camp bhej do :D:D:D:D
Cant people just give them some space i mean imagine u are going through this daily even after having mental breakdowns and bad days
It&#39;s not Kareena&#39;s fault. It&#39;s actually people being over dramatic.
u bloody mf. i didnt feel like its a unbelievable attitude. bloody mf wud do anything for likes and views.
This is the problem of being famous.. better to lead a simple ,,happy life without anyone&#39;s tortures
Why the public is that much crazy to get a pic what they&#39;ll do with pics 😂 many think that it may be a photoshop effect try to avoid them yaar they are Avoiding us we shall avoid them simple!!!!!😊
Visswash nhi hota ki kreena kapoor itana jalldi mar jayegi.. God unaki aattma ko santi de....... Rip kreena 😫😫😫

You should respect the space whether male /female, actors, celebrities, politicians or US.  Everyone deserves their space.  They will obviously get annoyed mahn!!!  This is not how we take selfies.  We are normal people but still we ask that let&#39;s take a selfie.  So why are the rules different with celebrities . Why to get offended with it? <br>Here, With Sanju Daa and Jahnvi was the limit!!!  Stop messing with the word FAN!  Of course they are because of US , and it&#39;s not like they don&#39;t know this. But they work for it . And if they don&#39;t , then we don&#39;t waste a single day or minute to criticize them.  Why is it so ??
Begging for a picture 😂, kam dham dekho apna
Sanjay baba ki galti nahi hain.. Ayse sab log pura gherke pic lega to kisiko bhi paresani hosakta hain... Logo ko thora sence nahi hota...
They haven&#39;t done anything to show respect. Hence ignore such idiot false stars
Public ine sab log aage badhati hai kuchh Na karen to yah log kuchh bhi nahin hai
In chutiyo k saath. Kya selfie 🤳🤳 ii
THEY ARE HUMAN TOO <br>THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO IF THEY ARE NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE
Such a sweet girl..
Tbh they sound so annoying just let her breathe and this is not an indian tv show or smth stop it with the drama yall
Look at her eyes in the thumbnail so funny😸
I think the bgm and overall editing is done by some serial editors🤣🤣
Sick are these assholes who run after these actors like dogs begging for selfies and not respecting their space or privacy
Self respect ki dhajjiya udhake kahi aur se respect ki aas mein ban rahe bewkoof fans
Irritation hai bro attitude nhin kisiko galat mat batao🙂❤
So why do you wait for them to get the 🤳

Or legend Sushant sir

I think she said no selfie aur sahi bhi hai friend hai kiya tumhaari nonsense celebrity hai but they have their own life too
I mean come on one should respect each other&#39;s space nd not get mad it&#39;s natural we ain&#39;t at that position so we can&#39;t judge....Just admire them for their work and move on...
Inloge ki selfi lene ki   bajaya apane dosto family members ke saath lo....<br>Ye kalpanik glamorous world h iske piche mat bhago....<br>Khush rahoge hamesha...
Ye sale sab ayese hi h bhenchod sab
I think video editor is pretty stupid<br>Everyone needs privacy specially after drink or dinner
Daaru hi piye hai na kaun sa bada tiir maris hai ..media bhi na baal ki khall niklta hai.
Selfie leni ho to South actors se ya Marathi Actors se lo <br>Jo log bhav bhi nahi dete unke samne phone lele kyu bhagte hai
Getlost kidhar bola page admin bsdk

Sach bolu to public chutiya hain
Nashedi
They are famous, every is Appreciating their presence not because they did a brave and grand job but they came out drunken. What a taste standard we indians have. <br>If someone ask : what do they do for the                                      -                              public is crazy. <br>Me :                    they simply do their jobs  -                      like us  normally
Ham sab apne aa jye na to road me cycle se bhi chalne me aukat yyad aagi

Wo kareena ki glti nhi h wo us insan ki galti h jisne selfee lene ki kosis ki bhgwan ni h wo yr aur tum selfee le loge toh loude bade admi ni hojaoge
In chutiyo ko itna bhao hi kyu dete hai log apni bejati khud krwate hai
Actual main log chutiya hain
Bharat main kuch andh lodey hain jinko pata nahi itna time faltu ka milta kayse hain ki inn attitude wale hero heroine ke sath selfie nikalne ka hain
That&#39;s why I love k-pop they respect their armies or we can say fans. I hate Bollywood because of nepotism and some star kids don&#39;t have talent then also they are considered as an actor, model or singer. In k-pop they only chose the people who have talent.
Koi unhe bhi smjh lo bhai.. woh log bhi pareshan rhte hoge na? Unhe bhi takleef hoti hai.. log aa Jake bhid bna dete
Apne ser pe b tumlogo ne hi chda rakha h boycott kro sab k sab sudhr jayege ye <br>Waise b hume entertainment k liye to <br>Ye sab nchte h aise kpde pahnte h so hum in logo se bahut upr h. <br>Hume khush krne k liye kya kya krte h ye.
Celebraty also human beings and they have right to survive theirs life however they wanted ...So we have to respect their work 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍....We don&#39;t have right to distrub their life 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂...
it’s not a big deal.
Subah subah yoga Karo Shaam ko Daru pio that&#39;s the secret of khadina Khan !

Why begging for selfie, respect urself.u made them stars.we should not beg for selfie wth thm nd give them space , don&#39;t irritate them .
Who are they.just dancers and can barely act.
I feel sad for her, can&#39;t she have a personal life? Fcking paparazzi
Why the hell you guys want a selfie of these people 🤮 they are available in internet 😂 😁
Aur ye book likhti hai k baccho ko kese paalna chaiye. 😡😡😡
Iam surprised ki isko 6.5m views kaise mil sakti hei
What&#39;s the point to be so mad after them?
She have right to deny if she doesn&#39;t feel like what&#39;s wrong in it
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎Yeh jo log hai na Bollywood ke ek no. Ke kutte kamine log hote hai mein ne toh inki films bhi dekhna band kar dia hai mein toh bas wohi Bollywood films dekhta hoon jo apne Indian history par based hai or I only watch marathi films kyunki marathi actors/actresses are great than this cheap guys
Or bhago in log k peeche
Etana bhi kya selfi lena, respect ki nai padi he lekin selfie leni he😏
Isn’t it not right for celebrities in India to have a drink and have a good time. Sallay chutiya media
Vo chuthai hai jo inka sath photo kijayai
ye web series aur bollywood hamare mind ke saath kaise khelta hai, colonize karta hai, apka apna relgion, culture, country bura hai baki sab accha hai, apki language buri hai aur english acchi hai, logo ko thoda dhyan dena chahiye, ye sab narrative ka warfare hai, jab apko kisi country ko girana hai to waha ke logo ke andar apni hi chizo ki izzat kam karna, bollywood jo dawood jaise logo ne hack karke rakha hai waha aise narrative chalte hai aur hame movie me, ads me, web series me ye narrative ko dheere dheere pilaya jata hai.
TU laty hi Kun ho insan hi Hain wo bhi fazool me sir pa charhana hova hai duniya me gandagi bant raha hain youth kharb kr raha hain ya log Inha dfa Maro tabi attitude khatm ho ga inka
Unki koi galati nahi hai...log hi unhe itna pareshaan  karte hai...give them some privacy man...har baar jab bhi woh kahi bhi jaate hai log pohoch jaate hai phone aur cameras lekar...unki permission aur marji ke bina unki photos le rahe ho to irritate nahi honge to aur kya honge...you should think sometimes.
Sanjay dutt ky sth jo kr ry thy jesy unko ghair lia ta us sy ksi b insan ko gusa ana normal ha...
This is silly ! You can take selfies with out her permission but you winge stating she has attitude ! What sort of justice is this !
Mental people they have privacy don&#39;t disturb them
Chi Chi.
😡😡😡😡
Sanjay dutt g ne bola tha ek ek karke
I don&#39;t believe it actors have sense
Enke piche bhagte hi kyu Ho ye sirf movie me hero hai Real hero toh mumma Papa haiii
They too have a personal life....
Trust me or not they don&#39;t have privacy most of time which frustrated them
She is also a human being need some privacy why you people always going over the limit don’t interfere in there privacy please definitely it’s a irritating one
ase ase madarchod log randiyo ko itna bhao kyu dete h
😲😲😲
Salon tumlog ki koi life nhi hai! Jeena haram kar diya hai celebrities ka! Aur sirf background music se controversy nhi banti! San natural reaction hai! Inka b din kharab ho sakta hai!
Treating them like God!! Just famous that&#39;s it
Yeah of course she is absolutely right he doesn&#39;t have etiquette that he should not poke his nose in someone&#39;s privacy
People going mad !!
Give them some space . They are humans and you cannot expect them to give you their time , their life isn’t as good as it seems
This stupid culture f taking selfie without someone permission should be punishable offence...
Chutiya type lage kyu ho sath me photo khichane, mere sath koi asa kare , lappad lagaunga bsdk vaale ko, bhaag bc
I don&#39;t blame actors those people are bunch of idiots,
Roz alag alag logo ke saath pi kar sone wali ye actress ...kyun marr rahe ho selfie ke piche....5-6 crore rs ho tumhare paas to ...tumhare saath bhi so jayengi
These shameless fans have no sense or self-respect.
Just ignore this so called actrors
Some people don&#39;t know the boundaries where and when, how to behave..... They are also human beings with feelings and emotions, we ask for selfie anytime anywhere we see them, but never think there situation.......
Ohh God this is so irritating, Celebs ko kitna irritate kardete he ye media wale specially heroines, kitna uncomfortable lag raha tha sabko
I mean they are drunk right? They are humans too right? Is it not okay for them to have human emotions?
Sushanth Singh Rajput is best among all❤...and great person than these nepotism idiots...encourage ppl who have talent not to these people who have just background not dedication to work
Actor achhe hai lekin log ###<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hai">#hai</a> 😂😂

Enko bnane wale b hum h or begadne wale b ......etna attitude stardum ka 😠😠
Now I understand clearly what a paparazzi is... Other term for them could be celeb annoyers
Ye log dhaake maarke bhaga rahe hain fir bhi chuitue aur gaandu fans inke piche bhaag rahe hain.
She was very nice when i met her london
Yahan mei bolunga ki in celebrities ki koi galti nhi hai pr public toh khud chutiya hai dekhlo inko stars bnaane k anjaam btao ab mei Galat hun toh.! Usse acha apne ghar walo ke saath selfie lelo woh isse zyada acha hoga 😳🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
Stupid humans show abig value for Bollywood sluts
Chutiye khud Bejjati karwaate hey pata nahi in logo ko kyu bhaav dete ho wese corona ne toh.... Inki le li bc chaddhi/diaper even kuch bhi bejte najar aa rahe h
Abbey she is drunk toh udhr ab kesa attitude, media is the worst ! I hate it !!
If they allow they will do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AsYT0NiBt8&amp;t=330">5:30</a>
Chutiye log chutiyo ke pichhe hi bhagte h
Without asking somebody why would you take a selfie? Have some decency...
salman was too much. Also the girl begging him should stop doing this. After all he and sanjay dutt are criminals.
Kon h ye fans log jo in chutiyo actors k sath selfie lena chahte h
Arey yaar ye koi bhagwan hai kya .......jo mare ja rahe ho selfie ke liye ......insan hi to hai ......wo bhi nashedi ........kyu bezat hote ho inke liye ........koi self respect hai ya nahi tum logo mei .......
Kutte ki harkat mat kiya Karo
Aap log ese kisi ko bhi gheero gye agle bnde la yahi reaction hoga
Who the fuck cares about the actors and actors, . They are just the employees like everyone else,
KAREENA KAPOOR COULD NEVER DANCE....THESE INDIAN ACTRESSES I HAVE NO REGARD FOR....JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN !
Public ko inko dekhke ignore karna chahiye taaki ye aake bole sir main kareena kapoor movies mein aati hu public be like:: haa haa jaa dekha hai humne nhi lenge selfie aur autograph 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 yaar mai sochti hu agar main celebrities ko dekhungi toh b pic nhi lungi yaar ye log public ko hi bhaav nhi denge toh kaike star yaar waste log 2 , 4 movies kya karli khuda hi samjhte hai apne aap ko
But some fans also do to much why to to close for selfie. Why want selfie just take photograph.
Chuthiya people worshipping these druggists.
Kareena Kapoor is the most arrogant actress i never saw her behaving kindly to the fans i dont know what she thinks of herself actually this people who beg for selfie only make them believe that they are so valuable and god on the earth
Bro isma itna over dikhana ki koi zarurat nai thi  😏they are also humans they have there private life.. talking about jhavni and Ileana they just felt uncomfortable so they  just moved a side but did not say no to give a pic and sanjay dutt he was full cover with crowd what do u think his reaction would be.. agar koi bi hota to wohi karta bro pls stop make such  videos and about selfie if they say no just move on from there..
I don&#39;t see attitude just ugly desperate people wanting selfies, leave them alone.
Thumbnail was 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bhai tune video bnaya hai ya daily soap
Yaar pata nahi kyon, logo ne in nachne walo ko itna important kyon bana diya.  <br>Ek IAS. PCS or Army men.   Jo desh sewa ya samaaj ki sewa kar raha h.    Vo log  normal log h.   Jab ki important hona chahiye.  Im sharabi kababi logo ke pichhe ghumte h.    Chhi chhi,.
West woman  of India she very much gatar
Paise kamane ka galat tarika 😉 itni fake editing kaun krta hai haha
In chuityo ke peeche kyu pagal hai ye public.
Ye kon log hai yaar jo inke pichhe rehte hai selfie ke liye hamesha.... Inko koi kaam dhanda nahi hai kya....  Kya chutiyapa hai matlab....kuch bhi... 😂😂
Ye kya Kar dala Kareena Kapoor Khan ko 😂 itni laal aakhe kisiki hoti hai kya badmash
Only the people gave them respect and popularity showing this proudly  attitude is totally disrespectful towards fans who made them
Log itne chtya hai na ki kya bataun in doglon ko apna bhagwan hi bana lete hai
Nothing else toh aese bol rhi h jese Or kuch bhi milega
Is hero ne ek movie dhadak kya bna di apne aap ko hero samajh ra hai pehle toh ise dekha tk ni btw iska naam kya hai?
I don&#39;t like kareena kapoor she has very attitude
I don&#39;t know why people are being so c<br> clingy and treating them  as a god when everyone is an important and valuable person in himself, but the only things that they don&#39;t realize because they haven&#39;t learn the meaning of the life and how once life is important
G chat le mam ka ...ye log hamare paise se amir bante hai aur hami ko neecha samajhte hain ....
Who cares 😴
I don&#39;t understand why these people are following them. Celebs are also like us and they are also humans so why should they behave like celebs are out of World<br>Stop behaving like that people and celebs both.
Ppl are crazy with selfe .... it represents a moment of humility
Amazing people..instead of celebrating and taking selfies with loved ones these idiots are running after celebrities intruding the latter&#39;s personal space..they are awesome Indians
There&#39;s nothing wrong they have right to refuse selfie if there mood is not good 😑
She did the right thing. Indian public hi C*<b>*</b> hai. Public ko koi self respect hai bhi ke nahi ????
Saif Ali Khan has right to deny the selfie but stare at that boy, unacceptable.
I must be very fortunate I got to take photos with Shakti Kapoor ji, Govinda ji and Gurdeep Gughi ji when they came to England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 to shoot the film called Naughty @ 40. 🧐 🤓 Thank you gentlemen so much and GOD bless you with good health, wealth and happiness especially I remember when Shakti ji pat me on the back and said &quot;God bless you&quot; 🙏🏽🙌🏽🌈🌹🌷💐😃 😁
Sab sa bawakuf wo log hota ha jo Bollywood walo ka saath photo khichwana ka liya pagal hota ha duniya main insa ..... Koi nahi ha photo click karni ha kisi gareeb ka face par khushi la kar click kijiya.
That girl begging for one picture...haha acha hua nhi mili..
What
Ghamad dikha rehe hai ye loog ...
Ooooohhhhhhhh.....dhum tana naa na raira rairaa dhin....dhum tana tanaa raira rairaa dhin...
Love towards your stars is one thing and irritating them going to an another level is a different thing. Don&#39;t you guys think that ?? It&#39;s not an award show or something where they are standing to give you guys selfies. Can&#39;t you see, these people are genuinely irritating them. Going very personal and at the end they say these stars never give us the so called bhav. 🙏 Please stop putting the other in trouble 🙏
Aur chadao sar pe 🤣🤣🤣🤣 selfy parivar ke sath lo... Nachne ganewale  Bhand logo ke pichhe bhagoge ye hi hoga 🤣🤣🤣🤣
0.05 watched this clip in slayy point.
Kaise kaise chutiye log hai re saale<br>Self respect vgera hai bhi ya bech khaye
Unhe bhi to bejar aata hoga ye sab karke so
Itna attitude tabhi successful nhi ho payi Karisma Kapoor mam tra vaise sis bhi or blood bhi same hai but difference dekho.
Mujhe to Karina se ghussa nahi aya .....Likin wo pagal admi ghussa aya....jese Karina ke sath selfie to....bahut bada achieve kar diya.
they’re humans let em live in peace too. nothing wrong with denying for a selfie and asking for personal space and privacy.
stop asking for selfies .
it depends on her own mood she is also a human being like us if she is drunk then how can you even say that she showed you attitude she is the best 🥰
Why foolish midea running after chudel kareena
when girl is asking one picture such a stupid attitude its going to take them no where idiots
Be a fans of those actors who has respect and kindness for their fans... not this of celebrity....I guess they just a HEART LESS HUMANS who just shows attitude s
these bollywood ppl are just showoff
🙂🤌🏻 seriously people&#39;s are really mad I mean why they are even liking them after seeing there attitude and behaviour...Tbh I don&#39;t like even a single actor why should I them huh? And why they are showing attitude bcz of us they are famous why should we run back of them like a dog every human are equal jst bcz they are coming on tv shouldn&#39;t matter...they should be respectful there funs bcz of us there in this position 🙂🙂🙂
Insaan kyu bhul jata hai ki ya log bhi to insaan hi ha koi bhagwan thodi jo inka saath selfie lene ko bheed laga date ha agar is tarah log in celebrities sa milna ka liye bheed na lagaye to apna aap hi in sab ka घमंड tut jayega
Kya asia gabjastie kon pic katia ha
Some of them clearly aren&#39;t at fault

They have the right to refuse selfies…. They’re regular people like we are
People have their own lives.. own set of problems.. wtf people just invade their personal space.. and yes stop following them like dogs

They treat you like shit but they forgot that they are because you put them there... You gave them the money to show that arrogance... Time to show them their position... Stop following them.. They will run after you

Ye bhi insaan hai yaar ye sab logo ki kwahison ko poora karenge to khud paagal ho jayenge.
Sitting home and download how many pictures of whichever person you want
One thing, they will be in a lot of pressure. They can&#39;t drink, can&#39;t have a boy/girlfriend. No private life. And we constantly pound them with looks and judge their lifestyle. What will happen if someone always watches you daily at the corner of the road, you will go to the police station. They can&#39;t even go to the police about paparazzi encroaching on their lifes. 🙏 leave them alone.
Why to give so much importance to these charazes actors, Instead go and salute army jawans who guard our border
Mujhe ese insan pasand hi hani ese insano ko log q piyar dete he ye log public se itne amir or femas he ye log bhul jane he mujhe Bollywood me se ko pasand hi nahi.
Pagal Arrey maha pagal hai... Log.. They are begging for selfi with these actor.. Seriously...
Ye bade celebrities bhav nahi dete fhir bhi ham log inse milne jate hai or jo bhav deta tha use to is duniya se hi bhej diya kisi ne uska support nahi kiya jo samajh gaya ho like kare

Yr hr insaan hr time  photo kichwane ke mood me nhi hota.<br>Give them there personal space.
Ridiculous behaviour, so called stars.. lol
I don&#39;t know why people follow Bollywood actors they dont have feelings for their fan learn something from south actor&#39;s
Then y do u people go for this rude and don&#39;t respect there own fans who made them hero or heroine once leave them and go watch our puneeth Rajkumar they made audience as god and now we made them god🙏🌏

Duffer log hain jo acting karne walo ke piche bhagte hain
Boycott bollywood druggiwood 😡
Don&#39;t we think we&#39;re a little too much she must be having a hard day and just coming up to her must get her irritated, just cuz she&#39;s a public figure don&#39;t man they don&#39;t have feelings, come on pple grow up
Aare ye pagal log dekho, in nashediyo ke sath photo khich rahe hai. Jab ki vo log bhav bhi nahi dete. Apne asli hero hai jo desh ki rakhsha karte hai.
inke sath selfie lene ka keeda kisme hai bhai????<br>i am staying in Mumbai and seen lot of stars but i never ever run for selfie, autograph and neither i run just to see them... they are normal human being, Infact real me to kuch jyada hi danger dikte hai.. kyuki makeup ni lagaya hota hai😅
MAMAM MEDIAS &amp; their SYCOPHANTIC photographers .
Ppl are so stupid and has no self respect.. Why the hell should ppl give importance to these low life bollywood actors.. They are making money and hve fame is bcoz of the public or else nobody give a rats ass to these ppl... But public don&#39;t understand that. The public has the power to give them fame or not. I have come across tons of timea with big name celebrities at the airports or in the flight or at shopping mall in London or Dubai. Ppl run to them for selfies as if they are some God. I hve never ever gone or will give them importance. They are nthg but joke. For me they are of no worth.. I guess ppl hve lost their self respect... If really ppl wanna give respect and take selfies go for the real heros who have contributed towards the country like scientists and all military men and women they are the real heros who risk their lives for the country they should be applauded and given more respect without any fame or money they stand against enemy lines to secure us not these good for nthg bollywood. I hve taken many selfies with these heros who deserve real stardom.. Long live India and the real heros.. THE JAWANS.

Unless put a paper bag over your head lol 😂 BUT photographers are too much also.  All up in their faces with cameras begging and jumping 😡🤯😳around into their faces like that too!    Learn from Hollywood paparazzi they can’t or don’t do those things!!!!

The baddd Sean was when the girl was waiting for salman khan for 5 hours
Dont give so much respect to these actor actress,they are earning from Ur hard earned money
Fans and media should respect the personal space of a celebrity.. Just because you are a fan doesnt mean you have bought the celebrity.. She was totally right in doing so.
Well, the people are crazy. Most are driven by emotions.
I think she say you son of a bitch watch properly 😡😡
Salman khan to sabse hankara hoa actor he
Dada ko pareshan karoge to gussa to ayega
This cheap and fake people also need bodyguard.
Chu
It is not always possible to react politely every time in every situation.. It becomes dismal sometimes according to situation... Speculate urself in their place
Thumbnail just mind blowing editing..👍👍👍
Let&#39;s ignoring them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AsYT0NiBt8&amp;t=285">4:45</a> bolte raho bolte raho ...Lol 🧐🤣🤣🤣
IT&#39;S OUR FAULT. Celebrities ko sar par chada ke rakha hai ham sab Log ne.If we all stop being excited and stop treating them as God&#39;s then their high head would fall down. Idiots have no value for fans.
One day i wish to become like jrd Tata and treat them what he did to Dilip Kumar..i wish you all for the same.. Amen
It&#39;s ok if they refuse to take selfie please be mature and trying to understand their situation also .
so call unresoectful starss wont respect the fanss.. And the same stupid fans still doing the same with them..🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️<br>Plzz grow up lah guyss
Ky faltu video bnate rhete ho, zabardasti khud actors ko pareshan krte ho or vo kuch bolde to yha rona shuru
If someone is actually drunk then how can behave properly, I don&#39;t understand 🙄
See you must ask promision to take someone photo. What if you&#39;re at his or her place? Will you act nothing or does it same as them.
Yeh actors sare jo bhi video mai hai sare ik no ke CHUTIYA HAI
Its not the fault of Actors  who act in films and sports , and are the so called celebrities 🙄.... arey bhai please let them work hard for us ...let them struggle with shooting and entertain us , public should  considered themselves higher than these stupid celebrities because we pay they work.....aaram se betho aur inki films dekho , ... they are only humans not God&#39;s 👎
Httt do takke ke log
These celebs are not the god ,,,be the hero of your self,,,,,and there is something name self respect,,,,your self respect is more important for you than selfie ,,,,,inko koi bhaav hi mat do ,,,,mujhe to bohot khuhi hoti he jab inko koi bhaav nahi deta 😂😂😂😂
Kitna irritate karte h ye besharam media waale. Sabko gussa aayega..
Fans mha chutiya h
In logo ko inke fans ka support hi yaha tk pahuchata hae aur ye logo ka behavior inhi k sath thik nhi hota stop to worship them like a God.
Kaay sarkhe gheraiche
Àale mothe photo ghenare
Latha marunnhakunnmhaklabtya public la
Kaaay murkh pana tyna tyanche life jagu dya sarkhe kay
Actor r meant to entertain the public y people should take selfie with them.
Har waqt app photo lene ke mood me hote ho? Gor se sochna bus ans mil jayega
Jinke paiso se star bane hai unko attitude Sukha rhe hai
Fans hi chutiye hain. Kya mil jaata hai kisi celebrity ke sath jabardasti photo le ke. Celebrity ko had se jyada bhaav Dene ka kaam public karti hai.<br><br>Unko unki life jeene do, tum apni jio.
Just leave tham alone man!!
Paparazzi! Leave them alone
Waste material of bollywood
# BOYCOTT BOLLYWOOD <br># JUSTICE FOR SSR
Thik bolte hai ki iss desh ki janta bewakoof hai .Abhi bhi inn Bollywood walon ko apna favourite actor mante hai
Is logo ko kya itna dikhana he media vale sale kuch bhi kachra dikhate he in nasediyo ko boycott karo pehle
Charsi
Every one talking how cold blooded Kareena is , but just imagine u in her position. You don&#39;t have any privacy, people clicking your pictures without your <a href="http://permission.how/">permission.how</a> will u feel?!!
If they don&#39;t want so ignore them
I am agree with Sanjay sir because they all are surrounded him like nothing
Inko itna log bhaw hi Kyu dete h in jahilo ko
Taking such selfies is not ethical. They have their personal space that must not be violated. Think if we were in there place with millions of fans around n we are in our own thoughts n someone shows up to take a selfie like that. We will also react in our own way
yeh kon hoti hai jo iske saath chabi lene hai
They get paid to make movies and we pay to watch those movies for our entertainment. It&#39;s a complete transaction. Nobody is entitled to selfies with them just because you paid to watch their movies. You didn&#39;t do it for them, you did it for your own entertainment.
Good
Chutiyapa..!!
These re also human beings only....i don&#39;t understand why ... people treat them like a god ......!!!
She doesn&#39;t owe him anything ..
Or dekho inki filme
Ye log hi chutiye hain jo doggy ki trha do kodi k actors k piche bhagte hain
En kutto ke sat kya selfie lena enko ye nhi pta chl kis wajh se rhe h Dane hum hi dal rhe h tbi femsh h sale bhilde makeup ke nipa poti
I guess people don&#39;t care about the feelings of the celebrity, they just care about their selfie which they want to show-off to other people
I feel they should have privacy....like man if she is drunk...then she might want to home ...not cheer with fans...pls stop being ridiculous
Inn nashedi ganjediyon ko to bhaav hi nahi Dena chahiye...
We don’t understand the meaning of ‘space’
she is hiding her face
WTF she need some privacy. They are not paparazzi but papi bazaar
Most of all actors in Hollywood are good. They know hw to behave with fans especially ❤️JHONNY DEPP❤️
It&#39;s people&#39;s fault not the actors they so pushy
Celebrity&#39;s hein koyi bhagwan nhi🌚behavior toh dekho in logo ki.
Meko samjh ni ata ki ye log selfie le k krte kya h...krna h to apni life me kuch kro....apne parents k liye ....jinki nazroo me ap upr utho....kiu aise logo se jutee khate ho selfie manng maang k
Public bewkuf hain kareena nahi
Chutia actress, why people running behind them dnt understand
See Salman Khan is half mental and very stone heart thts why I dislike him , kuch actors bohot acche the like vo pehle selfie Ni le rahe the par Baad me lebe de rahe the , par kuch ek no. Ke khsrush like Karina , Salman , Saif they all r Muslims and very attitudinal
You  are so fool guys  that you follow  these over attitude  actress
Hum log  inako celebrity  banate hai  are celebrity  banana hai to apane desh k solders  ko banao........   khan jaize haramkoro ko nahi
I hate actor and actress due to their attitude
And the shocking part of this is when they have completed a film they go out there promoting the movie that’s what you call begging the same people they’re treating like shit to spend Theron money to make them rich
Tina attitude kis beat ki public binary yah star nahi banpati
There humans not gods or roolers pls 🙏understand😉
Han toh uski marji bhai.. kharida h kya usko. 200 rs tkt deke movie dekh k.
Koi v kisi ko itna paresan krega to vo v kya krenge  Or unki v life hai kb kya mood hai kbi v ye selfie krne lgte hm
She doesn’t even look drunk
Why photoshop her eyes red on the thumbnail? Her eyes are not red in the video
Respect their privacy
Jihadi
Bewadi
Haha or delo Bollywood wale chutiyo ko respect
We should teach our children that these people are just actors.  Respect your self respect and their privacy. Dont go crazy after them.They are also humans. Stop begging for a  picture. And let them live their lives too.
Fuck all of Bollywood actress
She&#39;s amazing!!
They are not god,...why people don&#39;t care of their self respect,,,...
Bro... Give some privacy to them....
Are ye fan bn k enko Sr pr chdha lete h public kyu nhi samajhti hum log nhi to enko kutte bhi nhi puchege inki film ko  dekhte h pta nhi kyu en 2 kodi k logo ko famous kr dete h
Etna attitude kaha leke jaoge jana to kbr me hi hai ek din 😔
People need to stop giving these morons more respect than they deserve
I’m with the actors on this one… the so called ‘fans’ were very pushy and out of control. You can’t just assume that the actor is going to take a picture with you and get your phone out and stand next to him. You need consent.
That girl asking for picture with Salman,itnaa time apne maa baap ke respect par kar bekuf aurat,pls pls pls beg you bol kar yeh toh prove kar diya how desperate and hopeless you are shame on shameless fans
What sort of idiots,do paise ke bikhari fans hai,rude behaviour by lafandar fans
Fans are assholes what can she do
Dunking
Drink hai bhai kyu legi selfie
These all are so rude see korean actors these are so kind with their fans
We are the idiots who make them famous despite the fact that they are already nepotistic.
Aaare vai dushron kye life main interference Kyu. Khud ka kuch kar nah ..jaab dekho logo ka piche piche ghum ta rahta he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bsdk">#bsdk</a>
Take selfie with your parents. Not with celebs. They in fact wait for your selfies but we don&#39;t care usually.
Bhenchod tuney title hee ajib dala hai Drunk Kareena... Bhosdike jub tu Drunk hota hai or koi anjaan akr chipak jaye tujhe selfie selfie krke to kya feel hota hai!
In logo ke pass Jo paisa h bo hum logo ka hi diya hota h pata nhi kis bat pr itna attitude dikhate h
Kuch log celebs ke wajah se suicide kar lete h kya vo celebs unka ghar chalayege
Have some sense, Invade your neighbour&#39;s privacy and then talk. Making a scene of it as if it&#39;s a sin 🤣
They go around wagging their tails and tongues out..real scum
Why are people obsessed with these celebrities? Live your life and let them live their life .. they don’t have to take selfie’s with. You and you can choose whether to watch their movies or not .. exercise your right to choose!
Education: seek permition for selfie. If the person don&#39;t want to respect that.<br>Wait, <br>Why to take selfi with an unknown guy??🤔🤔<br>Because you are stupid!!
Our  real hero&#39;s is mom and dad
Nonsense video.. not less than a TV serial.
Sala logo ki paysa sa bara atmi Bana sala Janta nahi ta koi star nahi
Kareena is not pretty at all...
kya naam rakha betaey ka taimur,woh rajah jusnaey bahuth saaraey hindus ki kathal ki
inko zmeen pr hee rhne do sir pr ku bithatee ho
Let her drink ...wt is ur problem? She took money from u ?? Shameless person
Gandu media jate kyon ho fir celeb ki guu chatne
Stupid dumbhead youngsters atleast have some damnn self respect.
Hate these all
😏😏😏
Don&#39;t forget that this is our india
Youth jaago they are only actors not superheroes ,they are fake actors only , don&#39;t give a shit about them.
Chutiya log
Actress log kahi ke devta nahi hai hamare jaise insaan hi hai mujhe pata hai ki wo log selfi kyo nahi click kar wate kyo ki tv me mooh pe makeup rahata hai edit karte hai mooh camera se 😭😭😭 kuch galat kaha to exetreamly sorry

Fake celebs with big ass fake attitude
Agar respect karni hai to  border pe jo foji khade hai unki karo inke respect  karne se kya hoga<br><br><br>Edit. : Thanks for 😊 100 like🙏🙏🙏
If there was Ronaldo <br>Ronaldo be like: just chill bro let&#39;s take a selfie 🤳🥰
Ye log itna attitude kyo dikha rahe hai ye public ki  vajese hi hai
Abe in chutaro k saath Kyu khichwa I h ?? Selfie ??
Bhai kisi ka bhi dimag kharab ho jayga agar log bar bar photo mangenge mtlb bas movie dekho aur enjoy Karo piche kyun bhagna logo ke voh kuch alag duniya se nhi aye .
Galti in Gutterwood wakon ki nahin hai. Taras to un logon pe aata hai jo aaj bhi in actors ka apne zindagi ka hero, apna bhagwan apna sab kuch mante hen.
Get lost u Bollywood actress and actors 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Ye log hamara jeevan kharab kar rahe hai kyu puchhte ho inko

Ye log koi bade nahi he <br>Selfish le na he to Indian army se lo
Khubsurat hona hi sabkuch hai ye duniya hamesha sikhate aa rahi hai Jo ek galat baat hai all time
Khoobsurat logon ke piche duniya bhagti hai Jo beauty jawani ke baad khatam hoti hai usse kya importance dena god sabko acchi budhi de beauty ke actractoin se bachaye
🧐
Respect their space and ask for the selfie first instead considering them as public property and then complaining about it. They are humans too 🙏🏻🙏🏻<br>They get crowded and harrassed at times too..They are looking out for themselves mostly. I hope we all understand this and not belittle anybody like that ❤️
Inke fan nhi honge fir inki film dekhega b kon hum inko banante h super star fir inko ata ghmnd paisa dekh k foolish poor bloolywood Actor and actress
Do fan fest bring them as a ticket of thousands simple .1 cr people 1000 ripee it 1000cr just in a year
Spend 1 day... 30lakh per hour charge...
Dine karne ka 20 lakh
Kuch nei bas 10lakh do 1 selfie lo...<br>1 sal me end ko ek din  1000 ₹ do ek selfie lo kar de toh achha....
Mtlab kuch bhi ye koi serial h kya jo dush dush dush dal diya h
Log Bhi kitne gir Jate hai
I like that attitude
Saif did right
BC!! Who asked to click the pictures, no one is interested in there lives
Mccc bccc photographers..abhi kuch or kar yeh kya karra hai fuck up ..
Apna status banane me lag jao
inki to movie n dekhe
South acters are sososo best
The people rising up them !but when they got the position they forgot everything!!!
जरूरी है मना करना
Unko bi thra space de do itna irritate krte ho aur fhr sensation vi banate ho
They may have a lot of problems to deal with. could be a bad day, or busy with something sensitive. You don&#39;t shove the phone up there first, you ask for permission first, dumb fan got the order wrong when he was busy trampling all over her privacy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AsYT0NiBt8&amp;t=215">3:35</a> girl is so good whats her name she also allowed for selfie.
When you want a selfish you beef to ask consent. They are also humans
Whos the one with her in start in black nd red outfit ??? Shes prettier than kareena
celebrites also feel tired and try to be good to you but not always you can stick at one thing. respect them bruh😑😑
I understand some were being disrespectful like Salman but celebs need privacy to their humans too
They are also human beings they are not puppets.
Are logo ko bhi aisa nhi Krna chaiye ,sb ki life privacy personal life hoti h  ..
But  sushant aise nhi the🥺
This generation actors &amp; actresses have become completely worst.<br>Because they are depressed with the lifestyle, some are drunk, some are obese, some are complaining in nature. That is not the way to live. They need to deal with all matters. <br>How come all actor like dharmendra, big b, sunny deol, Bobby Deol etc are living and leading this way of lifestyle. Whatabout others? <br><br>So i would recommend that an actor should be loving, caring, sharing, friendly, respectful, bravery and also they should have a physical routine which will really help them in their future.
She just didn’t look she is a human too
Akshay kumar Or sonu sood ko 60d kar agar koi bhi actor mere saamne aaye toh mai dekhu bhi na
Had hoti h yarr pata nahi log selfie ke piche kitne pagal ho jate h ki apni jan ki bhi parwah nahi karte yarr wo insan h bhagwan nahi
Bevkuf logo ki kami nhi hai yehan inke peche marte hain
In sab chutyioo ke film dskhna sab log baand kar da to bheek he manga  ga, kui ke they r educated not very well qualified.
Public is bunch of chutiyas
These publics are mental patients
This vid is caption by the lifeless lonely person ,who just can&#39;t accept the fact they are human and not a show peice for him ,he didn&#39;t buy them
hawara kutta log hai ye jitne b selfi lene waale, kitna insecure feel kara rahe hai, tumlog apna behan ka b aisa selfi lo na, Bollywood film ka actor or actess hai na ki tumara private property, sadakchaap reporter banke gunda gardi karte hai, jis tara theater mein film dekte hai, aise he real life mein inne deko na, chutya log😡👎
These “journalists” harass them , invade their personal space, ask them inappropriate questions and call them rude 🙄
Really true
Guuh khaane wale fans...
Dear paparazzi you should analyse first before quoting any caption, it&#39;s a bloody selfish act to gain views and gain maximum audience engagement, you it not her it&#39;s you who&#39;s selfish and it happens because artists don&#39;t rebel for what media platforms write about them so you should feel lucky and thankful that they take everything inside of them so that you people can earn, n un logo ki izzat karna seekhon pehle wo jinse tumhare dhande chalte hai and dusre wo jinke kaam tumhare ghar kaa ration bharte hai, inse hee tumhare Ghar chalte hai or inhi ko defame kia jata h, ofcourse fan k point of view se it&#39;s rude but for them it&#39;s normal cuz they get same situation everywhere they go, but they have to look after themselves too n other things around.
This is how media platforms ruin the image of an artist, comon guys you have to understand they too are humans like us, I&#39;m not all a fan of kareena kapoor but this is awful paparazzi make stories on their actions according to what they think would be better for their channel, Despite of these people have all the luxury still they can&#39;t enjoy to the fullest as they have to think about paparazzi and how are they gonna portray the image in front of audience, secondly she&#39;s a female so she has all the fuking right to maintain safe distance doesnt matter if he or she is a die hard fan or living legend fan, bullshit i pity on them sometimes, <br>Just think if that happens to you where you were trying to safe yourself from intruders but next thing you hear about you is awful that you were being flirting with intruder and you wanted to touch him so you&#39;ve pushed him back and this proves you are a nymphomaniac, so this way you cannot even protect yourself cuz if you do so or if you push back will lead to your character assassination.
Bhai rukja nhi pategi wo
They are not god so pls don&#39;t over rect ager hm enhy bhav dena chor de to enky sare ego one sec m chli jayegi love yourself not tham are real heros only Dr and army not they apni bhi self respect hoty h 🙄
Obviously they&#39;ll get mad if you all keep on poking your nose in their personal life 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I used to work at a coffee shop in UAE Katrina kaif came there she was very down to earth. She don&#39;t think herself too high up
I think kareena was tired <br>But what happened to Saif 😲
Leave a start, any body who is drunk needs a space to sober down. It shows how much you truly respect na star or a person, that you just need your selfie and not understand the importance of space.
Saale ye log inhi logo ki wajah se star bante hai aur inhi logo ko ignore bhi karte hai Bho,,,,, isse acche to south ke star hai jo sab se pyar se pesh aate hai aur movie bhi dam dar banate hai
Public platform pr ye sare log Bhagwaan dikhte h but asli zindgi me insaan bhi nhi h
Trying to taking a picture with anyone without their permission is not cool. Why would they be ok with it... Ask them... Then take out your phone they may give you a picture... They are not always in a mood.  They are just actors... Not god.. your life is not going to get better by taking a picture with them ... They won&#39;t even remember who you are when you have invested so much time and energy in a picture.
Tmc bc wali
Sale video graphi legend logo
Inhe actors bhi humne bnvaya h vrna aukaat nhi The inki bne ki
Isme kya attitude hai bhai? Sara time unke aage piche, wo log b irritate ho jate hnge, or khaaskar nashe me to pta b ni hga unhe b <br>But saif ka to seriously haddd hai par  gadhe bhi humlog hi hai na, humlog hi dekhte hai paise fook ke inhe<br>And sanju baba ko to aise ghera hai unko saans hi na aaye chahe
Ek insaan ko jo sabhi gher le GE to aadmi hor kiya kare ga
Ek din jarur aisa aayega jab in celebrities ke Saath koi selfie  nahi lega because people would understand by then that they are just human beings like us.
Ye log koi God nhi jo inki ijjat ki jaye ye log aaj jo bhi hai hum public ki wajah se hai
Why people give important to such cheap celebrities take selfee yourself not with other I never want to take selfee with stars. Everyone is good n beautiful in their own look
Muje to kuch galat nahi laga. Ab wo bhi irritade hojate honge. Or ye channl wale paise kamane ke liye kuch bhi upload kardete hai
They are just tired and they also have there own privacy we always go there to take pictures just for becoming famous from actors , they are have there privacy respect them ,  and yeah we all are incomplete from it actors are incomplete from there fans and fans are incomplete by there idols (actor) that&#39;s it respect them also they also have there privacy ..
In kuttio ke bare me na charcha kare to behetar hai lekin Indian media to kutta se bhi  battar hai shame shame.

People need to respect their privacy and space also.. And not go crazy after themm. They too have their space
kareena &amp; saif ko bahut attitude hai.😏😏
Abe chutiye kya sub dikhlata rahta hai
I don&#39;t understand kya milega pics nikal k aise, face book, insta mein 50 like se 100 likes hojayega that&#39;s it.<br>No body these days literally care if it&#39;s kareena or anjelina jollie
I agree that she is drunk but she didn&#39;t said anything to the fan
Drink kr liya toh kya ho gya<br>Indian media hi gnd he<br>Actor he toh kya drink nhi kr skte unki b kush personal life he hmara media toh itna iritate kr deta hi ki j actors ko b apne kaam ke liye sochna pdta hoga ki je krna chahiye tha ja nhi <br>Chill guys they can drink, hangout, can show attitude as they are humans too like us<br>Baaki kaam sbhi ka apne apna h<br>So enjoy their pictures and let them enjoy their lives too<br>Dont make yourself ancient people
Bc itna attitude 😒😒😒
Janhavi has got her mother&#39;s persona, the timid kind. looks very humble and looks good with Ishan
lucky that u didn&#39;t have to deal with Jaya Ji
what? she can&#39;t have her own chill time, her own mood, her bad day??? she was greaceful enough, people irritate them till the last limit
Actually I feel sorry for the actors here. That&#39;s a heavy price to pay for their celebrity status. Constantly being hounded by people.
Madrchod bollywood actress hai sala 😂😂😂khud kabhi giro mat inko itna bhav mat do
Aaj iseliye bollywood ka yeh haal hai, yein log acting to aachha karti hein mogur Insaan acchhaai nhi hota hai, abe vosrike itna attitude accha nhi, sali kuttiya apne apko bohut badi tismarkhan samajti hona apni aapko, jis din ye public tumlogoka ye ghatiya movies dekhna band kar dega usdin pata chalega public ka power, lekin saala public v pata nhi in nachne balio ko khud se v upar kyu mante hai, humlogoke pehso sehi inka itna attitude hein barna inlogoka humlogose oukat kam hogi
Bhosdiwale mare jaa rahe hai..selfie ki liye..🙄🙄
They need their space….. why does the media make a big deal about them being frustrated while the media falls on them like rain…. We r all humans and need to respect each others privacy. Nothing wrong with them being rude….. give them a breather.
We love Modi
Sanjay Dutt didn&#39;t do wrong. The people crowded him like morons so that is what he could do and Salma khan is no more the big bhai character rest all did their acts on purpose in attitude
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AsYT0NiBt8&amp;t=328">5:28</a> he did nothing wrong
South actors so gud ,yeh Bollywood wale zyada natak kartey hai
What’s wrong with these ppl, going behind n torturing celebs, invasion of privacy!
Even celebrities need their space and privacy. This sort of behaviour of stepping into personal space isn&#39;t acceptable. If the actors feel like they will come up to the public, the public needn&#39;t force themselves on the celebrities. If one gets to see them in shows and movies, that&#39;s enough.
Who needs them. Stop watching shit Bollywood😠😠😠
I don&#39;t known y this public is going so crazy behind them they are simple humans who earn from our money. It&#39;s because of us they are so arrogant once we stop watching them they are disappeared.
She didnot say anything however instead of ignoring it would be better to seek excuse for being in a rush. Treating someone like shit who might treat your film like shittiest thereby costing you ur life.🙂🙂🙂Not wise at all!!
No these guys take things too far... <br>They encroach their private space
I&#39;m not her supporter or anything but she&#39;s a human too. Why can&#39;t fans and media respect celebrity&#39;s privacy. Like imagine coming out of your house and facing hundreds of flashlights and people. And she can&#39;t be happy every single time. If someone&#39;s not in the mood that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re rude. These youtube channels are just too much. Don&#39;t believe such clickbaits and overdramatic videos. Because you&#39;re not in that situation
Youths are really being deceived <br>The so called stars are just acting and making money
Don&#39;t give that much importance to these people they are not fit to be called as hero and heroines   their real and reel life is completed different
All this Arrogant janvhi was the only actress was down to earth
Kareena Kapoor always Arrogant nothing new
In India why the actors or actresses are treated like a god <br>They are just hero or heroine only in films not in real life<br>So worship the real heros.
Kya kaha mam nai
That eyes 👀
W
What’s a simple selfie .. you dimwits ., get a life
Ignore these useless stars if needed take a selfie with u r parents
Aunty ji daru pee ke pagla gayee ha
Editing 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Saale jaate kyun ho kutto k jaise piche
Har wakth Selfe Lena acha nahi lagta hoga
Why we give priority to Bollywood actors and actresses ...woh kuch bhi  Kara na Kara ...hamara life ma koi change nhi aana Wala😒 Show some valuable things
Yr wo bhi toh insan hai...ye media vale bhi toh kahi bhi pahunch jate hai
Walking super slow just to control nashaa
Really feel sad for them they forget that we only made them wt they r today... 😢
Bollywood ek gandgi hai
And they are human beings too who need some personal space. They cannot pose for you every time.<br>Imagine you in their place, you as a female celebrity and some random stranger guy comes close to you and takes your picture. Obviously will be afraid and scared. And also you cannot hit the person, as a celebrity paparazzi will ruin your reputation.<br>So atleast you can say no.<br>And people say that you are showing attitude on being a celebrity. <br>Wow! Superb. 👏
They are human beings too. Admit that they might be rude to people but imagine that you are coming out of restaurant at family and suddenly many people come and take your selfie without your consent, how will you feel? And this happens many many times with celebrities since they are famous. But they also wamt to live life like normal people, have some comfortable space for themselves.<br>So this should also be considered.<br>And you cannot ignore the fact how annoying media and paparazzi is in India.<br>Everyone have their rights so does actors. And I hate them equally as you guys do. I despise Karan Johar and other nepotism promoting people.<br>But bro they also need some space.<br>YOU CANNOT EXPECT THEM TO BE POSE FOR YOU EVERY TIME. Maybe they have some issues or problems. If they don’t agree to pose, simply ignore and walk away.
They are totally useless iconic personality
Yrr...just think about it ...when u r not feeling .... But others were clicking ur photo🤧
We are fool because we make them stars and this is how they behave with us. Aur pagal ban jao celebrities ke liye...aur baad mein rote baitho
Public is stupid ..media is like beggars.....mam man karena mam...maaaaam...
1000 selfies with smile and 1 mistake and now they have attitude but they don&#39;t have anything like privacy .
Ya we troll them on social media , and take selfies infront of them and don&#39;t respect there privacy . And some people are comparing them to Korean clebs let me tell you no celeb can stop in middle to take selfies not Korean not Indian or any forener just the difference is that Indians  say that they have attitude we have made them and all but fans of kpop will say that let them have there privacy .
It has two sides I know that they shouldn&#39;t show attitude but place yourself in there place . No one ask for there consent before taking pics I mean consent is also something and always cameras I mean you can understand , they are also humans.
Unki bhi kuch personal life hai. I think they should give them some privacy
What was Sanju supposed to do there, ab tumko 10 log aake chipkenge toh tum bhi yehi karoge, baat ka batangad banate ho, views ke liye khud ko bech diya hain tum logo ne (channel)
ye public log na kuch jada ho attention de dete hai in faltu actor and actress ko. jeise koi insan nhi bhagwan ho😏 eise eise actor aur actress pe to mei thukne v na jau. ye log hum public log thuk ke v layak nhi h.😏😏
Itna bhau agar scientist aur army logo ko dikhate to desh ka naam barj jata wesebhi yeh kabar industry hain
Self respect is not just a word guys.
I think it&#39;s actually the public&#39;s fault... They should give some space
Real Hero is Army, Navy, Air Force, Police officers
Bro. They’re humans too, not demigods.<br><br>Tum logo ko accha lagega agar bahaar nikalte hi public apna phone tumhare muu mein ghusarr de?
Slayy point 🤣🤣
I would behave like this for a selfie if it was Bhagat Singh or If there were army officials.. I mean take pictures with true hero’s unlike these.
Stop giving them so much importance.
Ye aaj humlog ki wajah se famous h puri india ke paese lagte h
Sala koi meri baju me bhi aake bethe to bat na karu ese logo ke autograph lene jate ho 😑
Let them live their life n personal space alone. Why do ppl bug them like this. By getting tht one selfie what could change??
3rd grade cheap actress showing off attitude..lucky that she was not slapped back..
They have there own problems they are also humans so they have emotions so its not attitude it was their pain
Seriously guys - i wonder why do people feel so interested in taking pictures with such arrogant actresses? i mean even if i get a million dollar to pose with them i wouldn&#39;t - Indians need to understand that you are the ones making them stars and then this is what you get in return - badlo india walo - they do not deserve such respect - your self respect is much important than running behind these 2 kori ke actresses
Bro public is also rowdy ... they cannot click pics 24x7
Unki bhi persnl life h yrr space to sabko chahiye hota h itna react kyun krte hn hum
Music?
Ye tatti se mu ki ke saath kyu he photo khichwana🤦🏻‍♂️😂🤦🏻‍♂️😂public he chutiya h🤦🏻‍♂️
She really seems to be rude
Stupid people...leave them alone....they are also Human beings
Hain kya yeh btmiz khe ke log bhi pgl hai inko ese treat krte hai jaise bhagwan ho
Fucking media does not have any other work!
Don&#39;t give them so much importance just ignore them the way they do with people if u guys realy want selfie do it with our army police doctors they r real heroes
Who is that desperate girl to Salman“sir please please please sir please” 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Celebrities behaving like asses. Without fans they would be nowhere.
Don’t never ever show shoff you should know you were also an loser
Hum logo ne hi sir chadha rakha hai galti unki bhi nahi hai jb kisi ko haad se jyada bhaao doge toh yahi hoga 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Inlog ko cage mai khud ko daal ke travel karna chahiye 😂😂😂

Celebrity Accha krte hai inki beizzati krke.aur sir sir please please kro.
IS THIS THING CALLED KAREENA SOMETHING GREAT THAT PPL NEED TO TAKE SELFIE?? TAKE SELFIE WITH YOUR FAMILY OR FRENDS. THATS MORE FUN YA
If it&#39;s a Big shot she would have kneeling down
Sala saif
Why u r begging them for a photo we must avoid them
They are acting for only money mad people didn&#39;t understand this don&#39;t call cine actress as mam
Media bhi peeche pade rehte h
so what... she has a right... yall out here asking every famous person for a selfie please get a life.
I am not supporting those fans who are annoying these celebrities☹️
This is like the typical Indian serial effect of repeating the same scene 5 times with flashes and stuffs 😂
Ye actress apne apko samjhti kya hai khayee ki hoor pari hai kya sare log faltu mein aise batamiz behuda aurato ko bhav dete hai apna jism ki numaish krke paise kamati hai ye to dhanda krne wali aurato se zyada bazaru hoti hai kisi ke bestar ki ronaq bankr apne apko bhuat izzatdar samjhti hai me to thukti bhi nhi aise actor or actress pr chahe saif aadhi aurat ho ya characterless salaman ya nangi kareena ho ya baki besharam actress ho  i hate all the actors sale besharam insaniyat ke naam per dhabba  hai ye sare actors ,thhu thhu thhu thhu
I don&#39;t blame them. Imagine you are going out of your house for some reason. Suddenly people jump out of everywhere taking selfie with you and everyday...how would you feel?
Comon idiots leave them alone.
sanju baba shi kia q k bandy ziada over ho rhy thy
How rude 😒😒
She has the right to deny selfie ,the fans and the media are sick people they needed to be beaten to the core
Indian fans are such mannerless and illiterate can&#39;t even respect the privacy of a particular person , she&#39;s a human being for god sake shes looks sick and instead  of sympathising her people are criticizing her for no reason
Public chutiya hai bc 😂😂
Stop making it dramatic  and  Spreding hate  against them
Pta nhi mujhe smjh nhi ata y log film star main apna ideal kyun dekhti hai
Kareena bohoth thak gayi thi or pk bhi rakhi thi, thoda sense tho banta hai ki usne aisa bharthaav kyun kiya....
Khud hi faltu movies bna ke बुद्धि bhrast kar diye ho abb bhugto..!!
Sare generation Personal life IQ flat Kar Diya..kya tatti film banate hai.. Family ke sath to choro akela dekhne wale erotica hi bante hai..!!
Lol heroin,lol hero
They have life problems... Its not easy to become an actress/actor.<br>Media think kareena is living her life happily but its actually not... Every humans have problems with their life and they get mad when you approach them..
Don&#39;t show ur fucking attitude to ur fans.... Today u r grown because of that fans only
It&#39;s Actress wish ,she would be tired taking selfie. It&#39;s not  compulsory to take selfie with everyone
India walo ki editing 😂🤣😂🤣
Such hypocrites they are 😕
Pulic lok khud ka insult krke q lete h ..inka photo leke

Bhai pata nahi kyu in logo ki peeche pagal hai public. Ek baar 150 crore janta inki picture dekhni band karde. Bhai ye log tumare ghar aayenge autograph lene. Disgusting bollywood idiots
I feel so pity for them. No personal life.
Idk why you guys are exaggerating .....she is prolly tired or what .....or maybe just not in the mood .....for a SELFIE if you will🙄 ......just so you know these actors do have their tolerance level and its not really nice to invade on anyone personal space
Shame on all . Useless .
Public Ki bhi glti h kuch jagah
I will never for the life of me understand people&#39;s obsession with celebrities. It&#39;s because you treat them like they&#39;re Gods that they end up sitting on your head. They&#39;re worth do kaudi.
चुतीया होते है बॉलिवूड हिरो साऊथ के हिरो देखो   अच्छे होते है
Kareena maam Kareena maam bandh kar do for just 3 freaking public appearances...they will know that they are just common human beings....no self actualisation need...no ego
Come to ours south indian how they give respect for his fans kannada industry

They are only actors not a hero, original hero is army man
Now a days actor are too much
K apni bhejti Karva kar lete ho
Bollywood singers are more humble than actors
I feel really bad for the actors. They are also human like all of us. They need their personal space too. The camera people stalking them all day all night clicking their pictures should completely be banned. There&#39;s no need for showing them off screen because everyone needs their time off their work.
Shame on bollywood
She is called so many times just for one click this the the respect of women in india 🇮🇳 😁
Itna sarpe chadate kyun ho yaar...koun hai yeh ..hum jaise hi insan hai koi god nahi ha joi inke aage peeche aise thokar khate huye ghumte ho...sabka apna self respect hote hai .tumhara bhi hai..use aise hi kyun kam kar rahe ho...kya yeh ghamand me doobe hue log apke life aur family ki jarurat ya fir sukh dukh me sath dete hai...phir kyu...kya karte yeh pakhandi log ..yeh pakhandi log sirf young generation ko bighadneka kaam karta hai..Abhi jaise yeh dring kya hua hai waise inse inspired hoke kalko aap ko bhi dring karne ka kaam karo...humesha ek baad yaad rakhna...in ghamandyo ki asli takat humse hai ...humari takat yeh nahi hai 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Sonu sood is the best
Salo apna khudka izzat karna sikho, khud tum selfi lene walon apne aap  ko  kutta  bana diya hai.
This is the reason why we should boycott bollywood..
You will understand if you are in their shoes. No one will talk about the 1000 selfies they smiled but talk about the one there were in bad mood. Come humans, we all have bad days
In sab heri se achhr to south ke hero hote hai

If I was there I was slapped that girl begging for salman
Fool fans..I am not a fan of any celebrities..
you guys should just shut your channel. they are also humans you idiots and if 150 strangers walk up to you and ask you for a selfie you will start screaming at people.
What she thinking about herself.we are showing the love on herself so only she is celebraties
Hum ne hi in jaise logo ka ser pe chara rkha hai

Selfie saay kaay hojayga
Why this celebrities are so arrogant🙄🙄...... they are nothing without spectators.
Not always about attitude and showoffs, she looks tired and uninterested....some media people makes it look like a big deal, it is a simple human nature.
Our Sandalwood actors are best then Bollywood,  Kollywood,  Tollywood and Hollywood 🥰🥰🤩🤩. Because they are Respected and love their Fans 🤩🤩🥰🥰😍😍😘. Take to Selfi 😍.<br>I like our Sandalwood all Actors 🥰🥰😍😍
They are made 😡😡. This reason for I don&#39;t like Bollywood actors and actresses 😡😡😡😡.<br>They are really ediyet, nonsense and stupid.  He is not Respected for fans 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I think prople who taking selfies with them dont have selfrespect..acrually they were ignoring that man...shame on u ppl...they were not gods..stop praising them
Jhootha
They think themselves as God what the hell they think themselves as
Simple logic is that these people are loosing their fans and name and fame with their attitude
Honestly, everyone deserves their space. It&#39;s not fair for people to just take a picture. At least ask their permission first. These people probably make the celebs feel like animals in a zoo. It&#39;s all about respect. Respect them and also respect yourself.
Bhain chod bollywood wale janata ka hi khatte hai fr un ko hi ghamand dikhate hai
Please don&#39;t take selfies with these people ... Without audience they are nothing ....they have not done great sacrifice to country
She is looking so tired.
Garbage is more useful then these so called stars. At least garbage can be recycled or used as fertilizer.
