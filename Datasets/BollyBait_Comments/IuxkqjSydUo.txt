Just wanted you to know that it&#39;s okay if you make typos in the comments below, we&#39;re all watching this with tears in our eyes 😭
😥😭😭🥺🥺😥😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Unike bangla cinema o korechen
Irfaan sir gone too soon..Aapki kalakaarintonhai hi uske saath aapki smaile bhi dil ko hamesha chhooti rahegi...And also been a fan of Parna as well and Tisha is fab as well.. Watched some webseries of Tisha as well and i muat say she is maazing ..Lots of love ❤️ from 🇮🇳..
It can&#39;t be called what Irrfan Khan does in this movie!! It&#39;s hypnosis, it&#39;s magic, it&#39;s one of those things you sleep replaying and dreaming about. Irrfan was the greatest to have ever done it.
❤❤❤❤❤
Most of the people here don’t even know the plot of this movie is on True events.
Nice movie
Bogus film.
Nusrat Imrose Tisha 🤍🔥🇧🇩 my favourite
Irfan Khan you&#39;ll be always in our ♥
Just watched it on Netflix. Came here to meet people who are equally in tears. 🥺
❤️❤️
Miss u sir Ji irrfan Khan
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
ফারুকী আর ত্রিশার এই অদ্ভূত বিকৃত বাংলা উচ্চারণ খাবানা,পাবানা,যাবানা এর জন্য মামলা হওয়া উচিত।<br><br>বিশ্বের সব ফ্লিম ইন্ড্রাস্টি চেষ্টা করে নিজস্ব ভাষার  বিশুদ্ধ উচ্চারণ আর মিষ্টতা ধরে রাখতে।<br><br>কিন্তু ফারুকী আর ত্রিশার প্রত্যেকটা নাকট-সিনেমায় তিশার বিছ্রি বাংলা শুনতে ঘৃনা লাগে।<br><br>খাবা,যাবা,পাবা, এগুলো কোনো বাংলা শব্দ ই নয়।<br>এই শব্দ গুলো কোনো আঞ্চলিক ভাষা ও নেই।
Poor direction, below average cinematography, laggy-forced dialogues, insufficient bgm. Only good thing is the color grading that creates a melancholic mood.  Having a hyped plot based on real life character is not enough. With such great cast it is a below average film.
This movie is so bad
We&#39;ve always wanted to see this film in our country on big screen.Still now we&#39;re expecting someday It&#39;ll get released in our country.This film deserves much more appreciation and attention.We are being deprived of this master piece.
This is from a legendary Actor and a legendary Director.
This movie 💜💜💜💜💜
Tisha&#39;s acting is just to of the sky. Truly an &quot;actress&quot;
Jane ke baad ahsaas huaa you are my favourite actor 😭😭
I miss you badly Humayun Sir!<br>I miss you badly Irrfan Sir!
The best
Bangladeshi Movie Doob♥️
Truly a magnificent blend of Mostofa Farooki&#39;s directing and Irrfan Khan&#39;s acting, both brilliantly capturing the essence of the story. RIP Irrfan Khan, one of the best actors and a legend. He&#39;s genuinely the best Indian actor I&#39;ve seen in my short life and the best Bollywood actor in Hollywood.
Which neighbourhood in London out of curiosity as I too live in London
This movie&#39;s Based on the last life of Humayun sir 😍😍
বাংলা ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Background music এ চিরকুটের    &#39;আহারে জীবন&#39; 🎶🎶
মানুষ হিসাবে তিনি ছিলেন দেবতুল্য 💔😞
This legendary actor is doing a movie in our country called &quot;Doob&quot;. Every Bengali will remember your memory through this movie for the rest of his life. You will be fine wherever you are, sir. ❣🇧🇩
Abe <br>Ye kya Bawaasir Bana diye ho

with Irrfan sir bollywood lost his  heart ❤
It&#39;s a Bangladeshi film. I&#39;m from Bangladesh. When I saw that film it almost felt like Irrfan Khan sir was speaking bangla since his childhood. The film was a masterpiece. Infact it&#39;s still a masterpiece ❤️ Such an amazing actor. We&#39;ll miss him. Lot&#39;s of love and respect from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
samajh kuch nhi aaya but dekh ke achcha lga
Irrfan
<b>&quot;one can save millions, but sometimes millons can&#39;t save one&quot;</b><br><b>RIP</b> - Irfan khan
Releasing on?
Miss him so much
Omg it&#39;s a real life story based movie. Late Humayun ahmed was anwell known writter who married his daughter&#39;s friend at his old age. His daughter was extreamly talented but she left the media after her dad and friend made the sandal ...
Irfan sir was a legend. He was the great Indian Actors of last decade.<br>No one can replace you sir🙏<br><br>RIP💐💐🌹💐💐
🙏🙏💕💕💓💓😭😢😁😃😃 Legendary Irfan Khan Sir
LEGENDS never die. You can still find them in the MASTERPIECES they have created.
Love you irfan sir
Love n respect
IRRFAN SIR!
Revolutionary road

amazing  !!!
I beg you @Netflix, please dub this masterpiece in hindi.<br>🙏🙏🙏
Omg only if I have the courage to watch this after this gem the star we’ve lost
I don&#39;t understand bengali but I m only here for irfan😞
irfan sir love you sir
Watched the movie in Netflix. Absolutely marvelous! Mostafa Sarwar Farooki is a great director, and Irfan Khan is one of the BEST actors of international cinema! Irfan Khan portrayed the character of Javed Hassan in a way that seemed so real! The story is captivating. What I liked most is that the director focused on the emotional turbulence of the family rather than on the scandal. The reactions of the wife, children (especially Nusrat Imrose Tisha in the role of the daughter), their struggle to overcome the shock and humiliation, and finally reconstruction of their lives is treated with dignity and amazing strength! Hats off to the director and the entire team. We miss Irfan Khan! He&#39;s gone too soon. And Nusrat Imrose Tisha is amazing, as always!!
I am a simple man.. I see Irrfan khan in a trailer, I like it even before watching it.
He is ni more...  😥 painful i don&#39;t know why why my eyes started crying when i think or see irfan sir..  May now i realize he is a best actor...  And the story end ,past ,gone 😫

This convertible and awe-inspiring artist Irrfan Khan was perhaps exceedingly close to bagging his first Oscar for best acting in a lead role. Bollywood was his launchpad and There was no one equal to his scale - NOT EVEN CLOSE
Hindi Translation of this Title Is So Power Packed: Na Mili Gulaabon Ki Dastaan.
Why why ...I NVR had tears for any actors ..
Oh God please send him back. Can&#39;t imagine films without him.
He was a true indian never talk about religion specific a fair great human with great ideology and an AWESOME actor, love and miss you sir, no commercial actor in bollywood can match you. ❤️🙏🙏

सुशांत सिंह राजपूत प्रकरण में नारकोटिक्स कंट्रोल ब्यूरो पहली चार्जशीट दायर करेगी<br><br>नारकोटिक्स कंट्रोल ब्यूरो सुशांत सिंह राजपूत प्रकरण में 180 दिन बाद पहली चार्जशीट दायर करने जा रहा है। एजेंसी से प्राप्त सूत्रों के अनुसार केंद्रीय एजेंसी एनडीपीएस एक्ट के तहत ये आरोप पत्र दायर करेगी। सूत्रों के अनुसार पिछले वर्ष सितंबर और अक्टूबर में गिरफ्तार किये गए आरोपियों के नाम इस चार्जशीट में डाले जाएंगे।<br><br>पिछले वर्ष सुशांत सिंह राजपूत की संदिग्ध हत्या के बाद सीबीआई ने बिहार सरकार की मांग पर इस केस की जाँच शुरु की थी। केस में आर्थिक धोखाधड़ी और ड्रग्स के इस्तेमाल के संकेत मिलने के बाद सहयोगी एजेंसियों के तौर पर प्रवर्तन निदेशालय और नारकोटिक्स कंट्रोल ब्यूरो इस केस से जुड़े थे। इस केस में सबसे अधिक सक्रियता के साथ एनसीबी ने ही कार्य किया।<br><br>प्रवर्तन निदेशालय और मुख्य जाँच एजेंसी सीबीआई की सारी गतिविधियां इस केस में विगत छह माह से बंद हो चुकी है। एनसीबी चार्जशीट दायर करेगी तो उसमे रिया चक्रवर्ती, शौविक चक्रवर्ती, जयंती साहा, दीपेश सावंत, संदीप सिंह और सैम्युअल मिरांडा के नाम शामिल किये जा सकते हैं। इनमे रिया, शौविक, दीपेश और मिरांडा ज़मानत पर रिहा चल रहे हैं।<br><br>एनसीबी ने इस केस में कई ड्रग पैडलर्स को गिरफ्तार भी किया लेकिन मुख्य सरगनाओं तक पहुँचने में एजेंसी अब तक नाकाम ही रही है। अब तक इस केस में 33 आरोपी गिरफ्तार किये गए हैं। इनमे से तीन को पिछले सप्ताह ही गिरफ्तार किया गया था। पिछले सप्ताह गिरफ्तार होने वाले आरोपियों में एक नाम ऋषिकेश पवार का भी है। ऋषिकेश सुशांत का सहयोगी निर्देशक था।<br><br>भारतीय मूल के ब्रिटिश नागरिक करण सजनानी को भी इस केस में गिरफ्तार किया गया था।  उत्तरप्रदेश में अली नामक व्यक्ति के पास से 200 किलो आयातित मारिजुआना बरामद की गई थी। अली करण के साथ राहिला फर्नीचरवाला के साथ भी जुड़ा हुआ है।<br><br>राहिला अभिनेत्री दिया मिर्जा के अलावा अन्य कई बॉलीवुड हस्तियों की मैनेजर रह चुकी है। सुशांत सिंह राजपूत की संदिग्ध हत्या 14 जून 2020 को हुई थी। इसके बाद से ही देश की तीन केंद्रीय एजेंसिया इस केस पर काम कर रही हैं। एजेंसियों को अब तक सुशांत सिंह केस में कोई बड़ी सफलता नहीं मिल सकी है

&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuxkqjSydUo&amp;t=23">00:23</a>&quot; 😂 This is not 2017 man!! Now your best bet is <b>Getfanz.pr𝚘</b>
&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuxkqjSydUo&amp;t=27">00:27</a>&quot; Why don&#39;t people use: <b>(𝐆𝐄𝐓𝐅𝐀𝐍𝐙.𝐏𝐑𝐎)</b> 📌 instead of wasting their time here
&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuxkqjSydUo&amp;t=30">00:30</a>&quot; 😂 I actually have been using <b>GETFANZ.PR0</b> 📌 no issue with it all
&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuxkqjSydUo&amp;t=24">00:24</a>&quot; 😂 Well I used <b>𝗚𝗘𝗧𝗙𝗔𝗡𝗭.𝗣𝗥𝗢&#39;</b>  📌 and frankly it&#39;s real
He not susant ...is his tariler get like ?

Apne kirdaron mein abhi vo zinda hai, kehte hain ki irrfan duniya se gaya hi nhi
You are not here but your lovely acting is forever
You know how big even among legends he was that he declined to work in movies like Interstellar and The Martian.<br>The three khans of bollywood Irfan Khan, Amir Khan and SRK.<br>He was the best in the three khans.
1.5 million views in 2 days wow. I didn&#39;t appreciate his acting until I re-watched one of his films. One of the best actors India ever produced. Saying hi from Turkey 🇹🇷.
Do the trailer in hindi..
Does anyone have any medicine here to stop the pain in my heart while watching this ..
I don&#39;t understand bengali<br>But that&#39;s the good thing about Irrfan,<br>People don&#39;t need a language to understand him 🌼
Probably the first movie released long after demise of an incredible actor ❤️
we lost a GEM , irreplacable IRFAN &#39;Great&#39; Khan
Wow I had no idea that Irfaan’s last movie is set to release and I thought Angrezi Medium was his last one 🤭 can’t wait to watch it 😭
Thankyou for this trailer.... RIP legend😇
Bhai kiu logon ke zakhm taje kar rha
When will this movie release
I&#39;m not a Bangali but trust me I understood each and every sentence of this trailer without seeing the subtitles. That&#39;s the power of Irrfan sir&#39;s  on-screen presence.
Love you Irrfan sir
Yeh to Bangladeshi movie hai
Still don&#39;t have courage to watch his movies...Why he gone so soon..😞
Legend of Acting

You will be remembered Irrfan sir ♥
Never gets tired of seeing his acting!! Legend❤️
Big fan of Irfan khan ♥️ from Pakistan
Miss you so much sir.. 😧😧🙏

Salut
Anne Frank said - <br>&#39;Dead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude.&#39;<br>Hope we will learn how to appreciate and cheer up the authentic gems like him before they die/ before it gets too late.<br>WE NEED TO WAKE UP BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE. &lt;3
True legend

But when did he shooted for this movie??<br>Did he came back from heaven??❤️😍❤️❤️
I met him a few days before he passed away, it was a chance meeting as he lived in my neighbourhood in London. I greeted him and said, if we could have a photo, he said &quot;photo leke kya karoge, social media pe lgaoge - guftagu kijiye, saari zindagi ye mulaqat yaad rahegi&quot;, then we spoke about his experience in London and I will simply never forget his words...
This is how legends come from heaven 😭

Mark my words and mark them well, on one side we can put Irrfan Khan saab and on other side put any of the legendary actors in indian film industry, it will always end up tilting to Irrfan saab&#39;s side.

It’s Bangladeshi Movie🥀
बंगाली लोग सिर्फ प्राकृतिक जीवन जीते हैं ।। सबसे ज्यादा अश्लील बताई जाने वाली चीजें वहीं से शुरू हुईं ।। बंगाल बहुत ही घटिया जगह है ।।
He will be forever in our hearts ❤️🙏
Gone yet not forgotten. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
অভিনয় যেনো কথা বলে। <br>ডুব❤️

He concludes the end of an era more for the 90s children who grew up as irfan grew as a finessed actor and became memorable because he left a distinct imprint in the conscious with his devotion to cinema and life.
Miss you sir ❤
