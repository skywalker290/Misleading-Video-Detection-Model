SUSHANT : Gem 💎  of a Person. Extremely talented.  Highly Intellect.  Return if Possible SUSHANT.  The world 🌎 is missing you Sushant. <br>BOLLYWOOD : Bollywood is definitely feeling insecure about talented people. Talented people in Bollywood are either under rated or forced to take an exit from Bollywood. What&#39;s wrong with Bollywood ??  Bollywood is comfortable with people who show off for nothing.Showing off cannot be called as talent in anyway.<br>Showing off for nothing = &quot;TRASH&quot;. Bollywood needs to understand that. Talented people will rock and shine from any part of the world. That&#39;s for sure.<br>BOLLYWOOD is CRAP. <br>INDIA : WAKE UP PLS.<br>Stop giving too much importance to Bollywood.<br>Start recognising the talent.  Everyone feels that India does not recognise talent. Prove them wrong. It&#39;s high time India. India is definitely at crossroads in distinguishing between talent and trash. India needs to address  that. Hope my country understands that.<br>In other countries &quot;TALENT&quot; speaks.<br>In India &quot;MONEY&quot; speaks.<br>This is the reality of INDIA.
We miss sushanth Singh rajput from South India

Remember him as a Happy soul, a very beautiful kind one who has emmense love for life, his fans and everything. He always create love everywhere he goes. I am hurt till now how his murder was portrayed as suicide nd we were going to accept it, how ugly and terrible that would be if we will not see the truth behind this big lie.. The truth would be buried under carpet. This truth be known to world that Sushant was murdered... This beautiful boy deserve justice at any cost.... <br>Rest In Peace STAR ✨🦋

I know how it feels to loose a person you love but that person doesn’t know you even exist...yes...am talking about our Sushant ...I loved him...i lost him...I was just exploring his all other songs...just again hearing this after few months....just wanna make me cry...we both are dealing with depression...but he couldn’t take it anymore...maybe one day I can’t take anymore and go to heaven

Miss you Sushent sir. 😭😭.
Listening this song and imagine myself with him under starry night between slow and cold wind... It&#39;s an amazing feeling 😌😌😌
Listening 2022
Love It ❤❤❤❤
They  get  💰  for  saying that.
All  those girls who accused  Sushant  of  being a  skirt  chaser  belong to the underworld. 💣 <br><br><br>It&#39;s  true.
One of the best songs of AR
This guy here is the proof that good things don&#39;t always happen to good people, and people don&#39;t always pay for their bad deeds. He is dead, nearly forgotten, bullies are thriving. That is life. Unfair.
😪😪
Miss you ssr 😭😭❤️❤️
So  nice ❤💎💍
Bachpan ka pyaar almost 45 crore views 😞😞😞 but taare gin sirf 45 lakh 😩
Sorry Sushant we fail to give you justice <br>R.I.P. <br>Return If Possible....

3 days to go for the birthday.. Love you Sushant. You motivate me to be better everyday. 💔
Ssr🥺🥺
It&#39;s feels like Sushant was part of my life. I was watching him since I was in class 2nd and today I&#39;m 17. I didn&#39;t believe the news about his death. I don&#39;t feel it was suicide. I really wanted to meet him some day.I never liked anyone in bollywood accept Sushant and Siddharth Malhotra. But now whenever I miss Sushant I listen his songs and I pray for him. May god give him long life in his next birth. The country loves you Sushant....❤️✨🙂
Is  she a good human being? 💣
I LOVE YOU 🥺😘
Myyy Boyyyy 🥺🤍

only 4M views WHAT THE FUCK ! It deserves damn better. Oh sorry guys, this generation listen poop songs of tony kakkar and badshaah not to Mohit chauhan and AR Rahman right !
I have something which don&#39;t let me watching movies, it&#39;s the pain I have for loosing u sushant.... Time heals everything but I&#39;m not agree. It&#39;s not, still my heart is heavy, still that Garland on your photo give me heartache. I m missing u every moment of life, either I am listening music or whatever I m thinking about you. How I wish I can bring you back as same as u r. Wish there is a way to communicate to departure beloved. Still my heart is crying Silently... I miss u sushant. Those who are responsible for your death they r curse. More they r enjoying life more I curse them
Cant believe that he was died 😣😣
SSR 💔💔😥😥😥
&quot;Roko ise jitna maihsus ho itna&quot; it&#39;s heart touching lines.<br>SSR will be always in our hearts ❤️❤️

I m in luv with this song
Tune hits differently!!!! start appreciating real, divine music!!! this deserve more listeners. <br>ARR&#39;s musicals are a treat. Mohit Chauhan&#39;s voice and Shreya Ghoshal&#39;s honey voice took this song on different level.
Bro miss yhh yaar 😭😭😭😭

Alok Chaturvedi 👎👎👎
The humming notes of shreya is a bliss🤲🏻
Whenever I Watched Dil Bechara I Will Watch From The Busstand Scene When Manny And Kizie Meet Again Because I Love The Movie From That Scene. The Movie Is Like A Dream The Violin Tunes , Sanjana Sanghi&#39;s Smile And Sushant Singh&#39;s Looks. What A Movie But The Climax Scene When The Manny , Kizie  And JP In The Church The Scene Makes Me Cry A lot.
Whenever I see him, feel immense heartache, still after one year of his passing away :(
😢😥😢😥😥😥😥😢😢😢😢😢😢😥
This song make me cry<br>I really love this song . This song is really lovely❤
bhai why
😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕
Fav song❤️
Anyone who has given dislike they are worst.
Tare ginn😘😘
Unforgettable ssr you could have stay with us. He is no alive on earth but he  is living in our hearts
We will missed you Sushant 🥺🥺 🇧🇩
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhWum37Mg8o&amp;t=93">1:33</a> Sushant was So fortunate to work with AR Rahman&#39;s Legend Music and Mohit Chauahan voice is really heartmelting. Sushant is the one who fits this line if the song, i.e. &quot;Roko ise Jitna Mahsoos ho ye utna&quot;.
Happy to know about aryan khan , bahut mazak udaya tha na usne susshant ka , aaj pata chal raha hoga .

World is unpredictable, life goes one day, people come and go and world cry for departure people for month, year and so on and at the end they forget the departured person, becoming busy in life, but whenever I thought about u, tears are saying,, no your time was not come, you have. More life to live, u had dreams, planning, they forced u to departure, sushi, forgot the departure people is not perfect for your life, I am crying all alone, I feel the pain of loosing a precious life, and what this will happened with you also, like everyone forgets dead one, we also forget u, it makes me too sad man, fact is that I don&#39;t want to forget u ,your memories, life, lessons, everything I want to remember about u, that&#39;s it man, but dear your people are still want u back, why your mahadev not seeing how much your good karma make u a beautiful guy after u gone, everyone has teary eyes while talk about u, come back our idol, missing your presence......

The day start again without u, with a heavy heart, fill with pain, teary eyes ,and pain in throat as I control on my emotions, trying to be happy, I am going to start this day, what u did for the people, generation it make me numb, now I don&#39;t have words to express this feeling, when someone did sacrifice for positive intentions and to do something good which can make the universe better then may be your sacrifice hurting everyone but endeed u get your reward, people respect u till the end for your greatness, this is what happened with u
What can I do for u mere bhai dil se lagaya hai tere ko aise kaise bhuljau
❤️💟♥️
