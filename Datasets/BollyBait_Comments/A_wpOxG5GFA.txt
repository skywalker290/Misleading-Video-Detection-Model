DRINKING UNDER INFLUENCE! HAHAHA! I meant &#39;DRIVING&#39;. I swear I was sober while writing for this video!
Dear your intros are length than a dozen miles , before showing the actual content you tell a long tale which is irrelevant mostly
You talk more and show less content 😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=240">4:00</a> is he talking about akshay??
“I dint shoot the black buck he took my gun and committed suicide” -Salman khan
why was Parvin Babi talking in fake accent ?
Apte reminds me of the “dog that bit the hand of its owner” sir your ass down women. She works with one bad director and calls out the whole industry.
Vai thora hindi bol le. Sikha nahi kya rastravasa?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=494">8:14</a> not defending telgu industry,<br>But we all know Bollywood is biggest in this game
bhai 2 min ke videos ko 15 min ka bana dete ho. A friendly suggestion - speak less and to the point, else the your great work and research will be masked and will draw away viewers.
Some actors who dont deserve a revival from a quagmire
Saif is one star kid who is actually intelligent well read and well bearded guy
Thank God Saif got out of that situation. Bro would&#39;ve probably gotten sexually assaulted
Salute to radhika apte
Telugu is the most regressive industry
last one shocked the hell out of me
Only Saif could have shared an  incidence like that with a smile on his face... Respect Sir!
Just a thought, if radhika had said this about Telugu industry today. The rage and bullying she would have had can&#39;t be imagined.
radhika apte might have different opinion about telugu industry today.
https://youtube.com/shorts/1V9eqbuaabM?feature=share confessions of bollywood 👍
Kader Khan won my heart he just is so humble and down to earth. Bless him I remember him as my all time favourite in all old movies. Rest in peace ☮️
Why do we regard actors and actresses like god&#39;s. Arnt we the one who made them. We need to stop this asap. Things are bad as it is and us not seeing reality makes it worst.
Salman didn&#39;t shoot the black buck nor he drove the car.. angel 🙄🙄
Why would u call a girl an actor? The word actress exists doesn&#39;t it?
Radika apte is such a shit... She just acted in 2/3 movies in telugu and she just blamed the whole industry... wtf... Many legendary actress like soundarya and sridevi never said such things even after acting in literally nearly 100  movies.. Radika apte is a real life example of dumbness
SLEEPLESS nights<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U87XDkMkFfU">https://youtu.be/U87XDkMkFfU</a>
Yeah right......he didn&#39;t shoot the black buck ....he was not drunk either and the person came under his car... 😂😂😂
Why are you calling him&quot;the individual&quot;
Salman looked really drunk.. but that&#39;s the guy.. the superstar who just does not care..did what he did.. and lived his life on his own terms
Prateek accepted his substance abused.. and he also said that no money /no work nothing.. it&#39;s like every individual has gone through a period where he does not have any thing and is a complete mess .. but with Time and hardwork you come out of it .. and it&#39;s important to go through such rough period because it teaches us so many things which shape our and some other individuals life better ❤️
Body language and behavioral analysis experts believe we subconsiously exhibit signals when lying. Did anyone notice how Salman nodded yes when he said &quot;I wasn&#39;t the one who shot the black buck&quot;?
Is Bollywood not male dominated
Parveen babi looks like Pooja Bhatt....ummmmm..
Akshay Kumar now acts as a feminist wow <br>Hypocrite asshole
Amitabh bachan is still arrogant
Sallu bhai is awesome.
Who was Raveena referring to
Prathik Babbar is talented 👍
Jammy doesn&#39;t let us forget that 90s is the wild wild west !!
Mainstream Bollywood is filled with cunts. I am just surprised why Indian public watches their shitty stuff just to make them richer.
Watched✓
Subtitles please..........!!
This is sinister and deluding! Why didn&#39;t you name Akshay Kumar?
Amitabh in the 10 most handsome man.... Is still the best joke
Driving under the influence
I feel pity for Saif and his experience with a woman producer...  Respect Saif 😊
Radhika&#39;s Statment about telugu industry is I think true because most of the times in their movie a heroin is only hero&#39;s girlfriend or wife. There is no strong role for her.
That Amitabh thing at the end was hilarious
Did his driver shoot the black buck too??..<br>😡😡😡
Amitabh Bachchan is not the guy to be looked upon..
Akshay Kumar, way to go for calling himself a feminist now... 😂😂
Salman Khan....drinking under the influence??
Radhika is bold, beautiful and contented persionality ❤️❤️
Tridev wasn’t an embarrassing film
Keep ur intros to people who people may not know..most of the names are known
I hate the person Amitabh Bacchan but I have to admit he is one of the best actor
Man you need to just cut to the interview! It&#39;s so boring to hear the introduction of each person whose interview you are gonna show!
Bhai mudde pe aa or gyan thoda kam chod......teri video 8 time 0 fucks k liye dekhne aaye hai......teri bakchodi sunne nhi
I also felt the thing that Radhika Apte said about Telagu cinema.
raveena is really soft spoken yr
Bohat pakata hai isaliye start me hi video dekhne ka mann hatt gya
Wild wild West.
Y you didn&#39;t take Akshay Kumar&#39;s name when you usually take every actors name
I get to learn lot of things from your communication skills brother. You are extra amazing when you communicate🙌🙌. I play your videos to learn new - new lexicons and sentence building as well to improve my English. I&#39;m lucky to be your subscriber. 🙌May Almighty bestows you with everything you aspire for @Tried&amp; RefusedProduction
What happened with saif ali khan that also happened with me at the time I was 16 I didn&#39;t realize what was he trying to do. I felt awkward at the time and I managed to get away somehow. <br>When think about that time I get really angry and I fill disgusted by what happened. <br>The kind of thing was happening an year later I was 17 but this time I knew what was he trying to do and I managed to get away. <br>So I know what it feels like.
Radhika should know that she was the one who chose those kind of films back in Telugu... There are lot lot lot more better films from the beginning where women had batter roles than men <br>She shouldn&#39;t  be generalizing the whole industry like that which is stupid of her...
Feeling bad for kadar khan.... I didn&#39;t knew amitabh is such a ..**
The English pronunciation words used were absolutely wonderful
Why the hell did simi Grewal stop the show it was the best thn now media and gives actual true answers whereas coffee with Karan wtf stupid.
Well If Amitabh can write WOW on kriti senon bold photoshoot ...so i can totally believe in Praveen mam
Your voice is just fab<br>.. The way u speak and present everything is amazing..it&#39;s entertaining as well.. 👌
Who shot the black bug ?!
I can&#39;t stand the sight of Salman Khan. He always comes off as an overconfident and pompous douche. And the fact that  it&#39;s common knowledge that he beats his girlfriends, how is he still beloved by his fans?? He also meddles in other actors&#39; careers to ruin them for his personal reasons. His acting chops aren&#39;t even worth a damn, so why this swagger and certitude?
What happened to Raveena Tendon is horrible and it just goes to show that akshay is an asshole for demanding such thing then ditching out🤦🏽‍♀️
Been binging on some old videos ...came across this one.. the Parveen Babi part..where she thought Amitabh Bachchan was trying or conspiring to kill her...after SSR&#39;s death, I believe her one hundred percent.thats how the film industry silences the ones who rebel against them... Drugs and eventually declare them mentally unstable....since they remain in no position to self defend ,they can be easily killed but declared as a suicide later . Praveen Babi, Divya Bharti, Jiah Khan, Sridevi and SSR.
pArtEEk  wAs  with  mEE  tOO  @  rEhAb  ,,,,in  kUrUkshEtrA !!<br><br>bUt  it   wAs   OnLy  fO  65  dAys  🤷🏽‍♂️
I feel that the actors who had  very problematic personal lives, regardless of the immaculate professional lives, were the ones who usually ahead of their times. like Parveen Babi and Zeenat Aman. sad :(
OMG Sharukh is looking so old.
Now that I’ve rewatched this video after an year, I’m wondering where is Prateek babbar now. Hope with all my heart that his absence has nothing to do with substance abuse!
Saif experience was just so sad man...even though he was a star kid he was treated in such a way...can&#39;t imagine for the people who try their luck in films
Bachan is a sketchy guy !
who was the producer that Saif had referred to?
From sajan till london dreams , temperament of salman was little savage, though he has his own swag
Raveena tandon&#39;s old pics look like Kriti sanon&#39;s old pics
came here for ENGLISH!
Salman Khan is only 5 ft 6inches...baldy...not at all hero material.
Drinking under the influence Matlab ke kuch bhi
U said be it the drinking under the influence case ..  its actuly driving under influence
Damn amitabh bachchan got roasted by her🤣
Salman khan is gay for sure or impotent. No wonder females don&#39;t stay with him. The guy is fake as plastic.
i wonder why is salman&#39;s driver always with him in any incident !
GOD! he has got an amazing vocabulary . Mind-blown.
The sad reality when saif Ali khan was confessing about his  experiences which were litterly close to harassment and the guy in front of him was just chuckling like it was most hilarious joke in the world......
I felt really bad for Kadar khan
Last one was epic
Pathan movie ke upar ek video banao bro . eagerly waiting for pathan.
Prateek babar is my favourite
It was Sangeeta biplane who shot the buck but because salman was about to marry her , so he took that charge on himself
It&#39;s so wierd that the children of celebrities get so easily influenced with drugs . <br>This really proves that drugs are readily available for them whenever they want.
Parveen babi was not that crazy after all I guess . She was murdered too.
Raveena Tandon deserves no sympathy from us because of how she acts with her fans and crewmembers
You can see Smitha patil in her son.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=520">8:40</a> savage
Lol I am binge watching your channel&#39;s contents.
Radhika Apte is like a smart version of Kangana Ranaut... she doesn&#39;t bitch abt any and everything, only things that make sense and should be talked abt
Saif ali khan pratik babbar mr. Shah and radhika apte ! Hands down ❤ ( even favs )
i hate each and everyone of them except sir Kader Khan jee and prateik babbar.
I feel so bad for Saif man. He had to play it off as if it wasn&#39;t a big deal, but that was literal sexual harrassment that he faced :(
Semi Garewal is good with interview
You haven&#39;t seen much of Naseer if that&#39;s all you had. He can make a separate segment on his own.
Honestly I don’t like actors much because I think that they are always doing acting not only in the movies but also in real life and there are many secrets hidden in our Bollywood industry and I personally don’t like Amitabh Bachchan because I have heard many a times from different People and read some articles that Parveen Bobby and so many other actresses and committed suicide because of him so I don’t think so that he is a good human in real life as he pretends to be on screen and yes no offence to anyone who is a fan of him because my mom is also a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan
Radika apte funny
Radhika apte should select the scripts properly in telugu, she has no idea about how tollywood has produced big stars like kajal, samantha, taapsee, anushka.
Nawab&#39;s were assaulted in industry can&#39;t believe
Radhika Apte only worked with Balakrishna and how can she categorise the whole Telugu industry after acting with a single actor who is very arrogent by nature and proud of his wealth and breed (he himself claimed his breed is different)? And more than that why did she even act with the same guy again in other film though it was a cameo kind of role with hardly 2 scenes and a song?
chal be, chutiye lowde, irritating voice me hagta rehta hai.
Salman khan is like john cena&#39;s character from wwe polarizing asf🤣<br>1.salman fans:let&#39;s go sallu bhai!!!<br>2.salman haters:Salgay sucks!!!
most sensible channel i have came across thank you brother
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=318">5:18</a> why is he laughing? it&#39;s not a JOKE!
Akshay Kumar aka Khiladi Kumar aka Action Star.
Salman Khan: I am a virgin.
Salman is definately under influence in his interview.
Normal Dress, Simple Hair, Minimal Makeup. Actresses used to look DROP DEAD GOURGEOUS back then.
Aur kajal lagau chutiyoh...
Did salman put on kajal here?
I swear, if i got a dollar every time Anmol says &quot;INDIVIDUAL&quot;, i would be a rich man today.
Mate - you need to normalise the volume/dB levels across different clips before export. The changes in volume are downright jarring on large speakers and one has to constantly play with the volume. All clips sound muffled contrasting with a much louder voiceover.
Salman looks to be in 7th skies under influence of drugs in the thumbnail🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel really sorry with Raveena Tandon and what she went through. Many female actresses are pushed to end their career and focus on marriage and family, while their counterparts continue to work and eventually lead to affairs and etc
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=220">3:40</a> Akshay Kumar?
Salman khans statement if I didn’t kill the buck is of same level of ‘ I am a still a virgin’ !!! I don’t know how to respond to it
I would say radhika aptes statement is a good reply for kirti karnadana who said 1 slap to hina !!! <br>I have never seen an actress so offended by a very reasonable statement though said in a wily way !!! <br>N I was even more shocked as to ppl enjoying her disrespectful response to hina...
Salman openly said in sultan&#39;s launch that while shooting he had pain as pain of a raped girl...this isd worst of all comments I have ever heard...😠😠😠😠
Plz reduce your intro part..
Wait, why can&#39;t you say Akshay Kumar?
&quot;The Individual&quot; ..lol..nice title for a movie
Bhai video adha samajh ata hai pr badiya banate ho
dude u talk soooooooo much
Raveena seems like a great gal
Never would hv thought Amitabh too is Like that 😐
Raveena Tandon is luv 😍❤️
Salman khan is a Terrorist
Amitabh bachchan over Marlon brando..c&#39;mon its the joke of the millennium
Wow Ravina Tandon was even more prettier.
Parveen babi was not schizophrenic the men in her life were toxic
Bollywood content is 90% garbage all the time... the remaining 10% comes out by the brilliant minds of thinkers who really understand the art of cinema
Yes that is why telugu industry has no telugu heroines.There heroine is just a piece of attraction.
Love them
Your voice is so annoying. Make videos compiling the items you want to share. Its not something we can&#39;t understand without a narration. I know you want to make it 10 minutes long for the money but that means compromises on quality. Grow up.
How the hell did GolMaal. Rohit Shitty  shity movie became hit <br>Rohit Shettty makes shity movies
I find all south Indian movies full of overactings,
Without you voice or should&#39;ve been only 5 mins.
It is strange to hear so many actors just being hateful towards Amitabh Bachchan.. 🤔 hmmm..
ye mahesh bhatt hmesa ka hi tharki aur gaandu hai
Which person ravina tandon has relationship with at that time? She did gave up acting for that person?
What to expect from the man who didn&#39;t even leave his own daughter...&amp; now it&#39;s Rhea chakroborty...
Last one was epic 😅😂😂
Love your voice. Adds depth to the videos.
I know I’m super late but what Radhika Apte says about the Telugu Industry is absolutely true. As a native Telugu speaking person, and a frequent Telugu movies watcher, some of the films, especially when she acted were absolutely disgraceful to women. As she said the male leads were to be worshipped and the female leads would always be those damsels in distress. Movies are honestly getting better but some actors, including the one she worked with, still work in these sexist movies which view women as just an object to acquire.
kon kon is video ko 2020 me dekh ra hai???<br>apni aankh phod lo!!!!
Please improve upon your hindu pronunciation.. u r sad with hindi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=480">8:00</a><br><br>She is actually generalizing. <br><br>She acted with Balakrishna and only 2 movies. <br>She did not explore the industry completely. <br>Too bad.
<b>I have watched many interview vidoes and honestly in many the old actors confessed they didn&#39;t like Amitabh as much. Surely there&#39;s too much ugly secrets hidden about him. I definitely don&#39;t see him as an the most talented or famous actor</b>
Me watching other channel video - intro music starts, me double tapping my mobile screen.  <br><br>Me watching TRP (new) videos - nodding to the music, occassionally raising my finger and grooving.
I really like ur accent, ur language, ur voice... I wish I could be as fluently as you r..
Muslim actors always get hard time in India. Very sad truth.
I was cheaking comment and i have to say you have quality no. of view not quantity. Keep going bro
What is drinking under influence
For some reason, i always knew that Salman khan did not shoot the deer.
U describe too much which is so annoying..just show what we wanted to see..dude we have brain to analyze everything
I&#39;m a rare soul who is neutral to Salman Khan
I understand your thought on other s but Salman did not confession isn’t that misleading. I like your content but feel you always portray salman  with negativity. It is not a bout his super stardom why people like him its his generosity which people love on the hand Amitabh I feel was an narcissist a player behind the scenes who uses his power to degrade people. There was a reason why parveen bhabi had said things she had said not solely schizophrenia.  There are different level of schizophrenia like any other illnesses and she certainly did not sound in-stable in the interview. I guess he used her and dumped her  l
Whoever it is, very sad voice-over, sir. Keep it little energetic.
U have done  good research man kuddos
I&#39;m waiting for Salman and aish&#39;s confessions on their relationship and also hrithik n kangana...still not clear who&#39;s a lier n who&#39;s saying the truth.
why dont you create a video on &quot;How starts do negative publicity for their movie and how it went the other way&quot;<br>like deepika going for caa oppose for promoting chapak
Looks like Amitabh tops the list. Honestly I feel like there are lots of stories about him but only few choose to speak.
Here for kadar khan ✌
I haaad toooo increaaaase the speeeed by 1.5x timeeessss to avoooiiiddd the SSSSLLLLOOOOOWWWWWWW voiceeeeeee
Radhika Apte! ❤️ Parveen Babi ❤️❤️
bhai tu khud jyada bolta hai content kam dikhata hai
Your voice resembles so much like Neil Nitin mukesh
actually Salman khan didn&#39;t shoot the blackbuck, it was one of the actresses...but he just took the blame on him thinking that he can dodge the bullet of the law with his money.
after watching this ... im grateful for how simple my life is .
Man Radhika worked with bala Krishna 🤦‍♀️😂 it doesn&#39;t mean the whole industry is like that
Is it just me going mad? Or is he talking slowly .. my playback is speed is also normal and he sounds ok in other videos but this sounds like playback speed x0.5
Raveena ki awaz kitni sexy hai.....🥰🥰
Wtf you cant even name people in videos about candid interview
Bruh if saif goes bankrupt it won&#39;t take time for salman to frame him trust me
amitabh is ugly as fuck.
I think it was SAIF who had shot the buck...
Wow Praveen babi was so clear and articulated when she talked about Amitabh. now I realised well how actually is his character.
even a moon has a dark side but who can say it Amitabh was shining like a sun those days
I think salman is waiting for government to allow same sex marriage then he&#39;s gonna announce that he&#39;s gay and marry karan johar. Lol that would be pretty wild.
I love your voice  tone!!!!
Apte is extremly..hypocritical..<br>She said she snapped at.. bal krishna..next day she  said she slapped.. him<br>Then she said they give good money..in telugu industry<br>Wat does she want??? She did al d movies there became known..<br>Now she complains! I mean that time she was quiet she dint even quit d movie
Parveen Babi was and is right about people are over rating Amitab bachan. But I guess on can when they are 1.5 billion of the entire population they can do false propaganda
What happens to Qadir Khan on the end days of his life was so unfortunate and it uncovered the face of so many famous people and there minor character
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=530">08:50</a> drinking under influence case 😂
Dark side of amitabh bacchan — Sikh genocide in 1984 , he triggered the mob by saying “khoon ka badla khoon se lenge”
Parveen Babi&#39;s unfortunate life breaks my heart. She deserved better.
&#39;Drinking under influence&#39;.
Kinda irritated by the way you speak. You have slurry speech.. And need to work on your pauses. It&#39;s like you&#39;re drunk and can&#39;t fuckin talk. No complains with your content. Just, work on the way you talk
Blackbuck was asking for autograph &amp; Salman gave it . Obviously he used gun instead of a pen.🙂
Used to love him.....now, can’t the sight of him.
I agree with Parveen Babi.
when did salman said he killed it as you narreted. He did not confess, not atleast in your video, So what the hell you talking about ??????????????????????????????????????????  And BTW i HATE  SALMAN KHAN.
Correct amitabh bacchan does not deserve this title there r many ahead of him
Y so much english ?
Saif took acting class even though he was a star kid. Younger star kids should learn from saif.
I loved prateek&#39;s work and God listening to the interview just took me back to why and his voice 😩😍💞
Salman Khan: no matter how bogus the content is...
Driving* Under Influence (not Drinking)
Bro ur killing me! Salman khan and his &quot;DRINKING under influence case&quot; LMFAO!!!🤣
What type of Movie should bollywood focus so that with the entertainment the should be some social awareness
The confessions are not as dramatic as your intros...
I am skipping your intros now because they are long and boring. Why not jumping to the content rightaway
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=154">2:34</a> Sunil shetty’s suite 😂😂😂
Saif ali khan is too underrated sad he doesn&#39;t get the success
Prateek babbar is good though
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=528">8:48</a> &quot;drinking&quot; under influence?? 😂😂
Saif is the best and unfiltered ❤💯 I love him
Idiot, you haven&#39;t mentioned the name of fearless, bold and beautiful queen of Bollywood Kangana.
Salman khan sucks now he looks old as fck while ther was a time when i was his biggest fan but now dnt like this shit at all he should not appeared before the camera as of now as it will be better for this shit nigga  as many people shit on him now 😤💩<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23illuminati">#illuminati</a> puppet/////!!
Drinking under influence?
Parveen is right i agree
Men who have faced such acts should speak up too me too isn&#39;t about fighting gender. It&#39;s about people fighting other people in power who use such power or position to harass the ones who are under them.
It seems like your voice is different..... it&#39;s sounding like you&#39;re trying to speak slowly
I think Salman was still in influence when he gave that interview .
Ravina is looking so close to tapsi pannu , isn&#39;t it?
Love your voice 👌
S
Lol i agree to her amitabh stands no where in looks in comparison to Dharmendra vinod khana suni dutt and even shakal 😂
I read on Quora that in the last days of Parveen Babi she was collecting evidences against Sanjay Dutt with his links Bombay attacks....and Dutt threatened her to death showing off his connections....she also had to appear in court but didn&#39;t .... I guess due to fear<br>I know there were some mental problems but something is fishy and looks like covered up when you research about her last days...
The interviewer is laughing while Saif recalls all the harassment he faced. Saif himself is understandably light hearted about it presumably because he knows no one would bother recognizing him as a a victim. Now imagine if it was a woman? I&#39;m a woman, and I can still spot the hypocrisy.
The persons who appears to have done no sin..... Imagine the kind of shit he/ she must have done to keep it that way.
Amitabh is overrated in both the terms be it acting or handsomeness
Bc boly bagher video bnaya kr kaan chud jaty hn teri awaz sjn sun
&quot;Drinking under the influence!&quot; Yeah right
Why do you never take the name of men who have ruined lives? It&#39;s almost convenient to leave the name of perpetrators
Don’t know how all these fools are watching your videos think all don’t have any knowledge about Films just like you
@Tried&amp;Refused Productions what the fuck you know about South Industry???? Never ever comment about South Cinemas!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bloodyasshole">#BloodyAssHole</a>
@Tried&amp;Refused Productions you have Zero knowledge about cinema I believe I’ve watched your 10-15 videos none of them have clarity better be calm n don’t post any videos hereafter <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sonofabitch">#SonOfABitch</a>
I feel like a bad person eager to dig gossip about celebrities. <br>I hope we can understand they too are human beings and in trying to be transparent to the public, we have rather invaded their privacy with mockery.
Have you not seen Aap ki Adalat Kagna Ranaut episode?
Praveen babe is diva how beautiful she was
pls make ur video in Urdu or Hindi 🤔
I feel so English challenged after watching your video. Every time
Your videos are good. But please don&#39;t talk too much. Don&#39;t give intros for each actor. It&#39;s irritating and we forward your commentary. Please consider my opinion, I&#39;m sure many people have same opinion
video starts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=65">1:05</a>  :)     thank me later!
Chutiye lodu .... intro kam rakh tujhe nai Sunna chahata koi
I didn&#39;t understand your reaction to Salman&#39;s comment
Great content, jamy pants.
Salman is a superstar ????? You&#39;re on high bro😏
Salman khan lol...<br>Bhai ki rat ki utari nhi thi...<br>😂🤣🤣
Drinking under influence 😜👏
I dont like salman khan but my 8 month old loves whenever he is on screen 😂🤣🤣🤣
Who is Tandon talking about
Its perveen bobby not babi!!!
Radhika is the only one who doesn’t come across as self obsessed like other actors in this video .
Damn.... This video reminded me how gorgeous raveena is.
I wonder what happened to people in the 80&#39;s
Yeah Yeah...it was Reema Lagoo who shot the blackbuck... she was practicing Vaastav&#39;s climax.
Please shorten ur intro
The brotha still getting high on green which is totally not the substance he mentioned before.
Amitabh Is so selfish
Don&#39;t you think Parveen Babi, even during Schizophrenia said the truth??? Amazing lady!!!
Amitabh bacchan is a narcissist. The way he acts on twitter is pathetic
Eehhmm why did he not mention Akshay&#39;s name??
Intros and slow voice is annoying
Salman is love no matter what!!!
you said drinking under influence, shouldn&#39;t it be driving under influence?!
Prateik Babar was in Chhichhorre
Salman looks drunk in the interview
OMG. Salmaan. Accepted ....
Amitabh Bachchan jeaise log racism krte hai....<br>कादिर JI umer me bade the... Ulta unko sir bolna chahiye
Please review the kannada movie Adventure s of shrimannayana (ASN) trailer, releasing in 5 languages.
Akshay =abaa <br>ravina =Harmonium
Wat Radhika Apte said ....is 100% true
I honestly hate how all the interviewers laughed when Saif Ali Khan talked about those people. Really though, how can that be a joke to you?
I think radhika apte done a movie with balakrishna so she had a bad experience except him remaining fraternity is very good because there is no telugu girl in the telugu industry all are from North side
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=326">5:26</a> took me a moment to realize it&#39;s a guy in black T
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=528">8:48</a> <b>Driving</b> under influence and not <b>Drinking</b> under influence. You are really good with narration and that&#39;s what made me get the hook to your channel.<br>Edit: I am <b>not</b> sober while writing this and not reading the comment above. Fuck, as soon as I posted I realized.
I just have a feeling that saif shot the blackbuck but feared his father and family’s royal reputation so, Salman took it.
Tu gay hai na
Parveen Babi&#39;s confession was sonething else...
Like me or hate me but the truth is that Sir alec guinness was the star of the millennium.
<b>Salman never shot the blackbuck... it ws conspiracy wich was planned by the elites of the country... Rilly sad but true.</b>
Raadhika apte is lieing about telugu industry, watch gr8 actress jeniliya speak about telugu industry she told this &quot; i was different charecter roles in telugu instead of the same bubbly girl in hindi cinema&quot;
I think you should mention your sources of information in the description... cause that is kind of what it is for...<br><br><br>And it&#39;s also helpful and reliable, so I guess that&#39;s a responsible thing to do... and we can even see the original stuff and references and stuff.
Well radhika did films with balakrishna..and seriously he is the most stupid actor that one could choose in Telugu industry
Well they&#39;re actor&#39;s not a saint theirs job is to entertain us not teaching morals.
Please stop making videos from 19&#39;s time
I feel like you&#39;re going to say, &quot;Burger King foot lettuce&quot; anytime now..
The male chauvinist radhika apte talked about is balakrishna nandamuri. Not everyone is like that guy. He&#39;s an alcoholic, egoistic and an idiot
Amitabh is a very shady charecter
Raveena tandon is soooo gorgeous!!
Who knows who raveena is talking about
Dumb charades isn&#39;t pronounced as dumb sh-&quot;raads&quot; <br>It is pronounced as dumb sh-&quot;raids&quot; <br>Great work on the videos though, much love ❤
Buddy please adjust the studio of the clip and your voice over..... I&#39;m constantly changing the volume
Bhai tu hindi m bola kr smjh ni aata kuch bhi
This is my opinion about salman khan..<br>I found salman khan like a guy jo har group me hota hai aur bolta haina..arey ham avi zinda hai kyun tension le raha hai <br><br>His dialogue main dil mein aata hu samagh me nahi  suits him
But telugu people thinks that they produce India&#39;s best movies
Both the stories Saif told were of sexual harassment
That salamn&#39;s 2008 look for yuvraaj movie was so dope that salamn is not seen after 2010 that salman ks lost the hunk salman radheof wanted and he cannot match it in radhe as its too late his appearance os now totally changed it will be good but &quot;...woh wali baat nhi ayege&quot;
I like ur videos.<br>But common on bro.<br>U cnt show poster of Tridev wen u talk bout most embarrassing movies of Nasserudin shah.<br>Tridev is one of the best commercial movies.
I want Prateek Babbar (pardon for spelling)<br>To be at good place,<br>Isn&#39;t it funny plus devastating how TIME changes<br>And i mean all the actors and actresses of film industry,
Raveena ❤️
That dish is unprepared without adding kangana ranawat flavour 😆
Re-upload i saw this earlier
All these 90s ka playboys are suddenly going on a moral high ground now!🤣
Pratik Babbar is gorgeous!
2.58*<b>did had***</b> ???? How it is possible?????
Raveena tandon looked extremely BeAUTIFUL…..
Radhika apte is a bitch. She has NO fucking evidence to say about telegu industry.
Very very oversmart Salman khan...wow
Your content is good but the quality of the pictures are not upto the mark.
Nice video.
I don&#39;t know how this handsome list works but i think Vinod Khanna was more handsome.
Partick is very powerful and intense actor but he does not get much movies
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=486">8:06</a> Young and innocent Rajeev Masand
Rip qadir khan we should all aspire to have the self respect that you had sir.
The same person gets abused and when becomes successful starts abusing. This industry needs laws and regulation. The rights violations and abusing junior artists has to stop.
Amitabh Bachhan over rated UP vala bhaiyaa.
Wait what, who was raveena with ???
balakrishna is a mad man how come that old man act in movies doing out the world action and cinema
Tridev - embarassing? It was masala at its best.. With a super soundtrack and music.. Come on!
Liked for Praveen Bobby 🤣🤣🤣
I&#39;d forgotten how fantastic Raveena&#39;s enunciation is. So clear and wonderful.
Respect to babbar
Pratik babbar looks like a beggar so does Arjun Kapoor.<br>They are in Bollywood just because of Nepotism.<br>My Neighbour looks way more handsome and is doing side actor and dancer&#39;s work.
Ur English sounds Made Up with an irritating Fake Accent.
Tere to main adds be skip karta hu ANGREZO KE AULAD.jab tak hindi me nahe BANATE.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=530">8:50</a> &quot;Drinking under influence&quot;???....Ohh you meant &quot;Driving under influence&quot;
Salman Khan didn&#39;t completely disclose what he had to say, I mean why did he even started telling about it in the first place when he had no intentions to share.<br>Anyways youu have stunning skills 🙂
Make a video on best acting performances in Indian cinema
Parveen’s english is really really good.
Bro, Assamese movie Aamis ka reviews do na
Akshay and Amitabh both have dark secret..they did many kaands in their life..and we treat them like God
Saif- 4: 47<br>Salman-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=505">8:25</a>
I completely agree with late Parveen Babi even though I&#39;m a huge fan of Mr. Bachchan.
Akshay kumar that&#39;s the name,by the way tollywood is highly patriotic this is well known fact include her interview during her one of the cost controversial movie starts with &quot;P&quot;🤔🤐
I hate akshy Kumar for doing this to raveena mam.
Man you raelly hate salman khan don’t you
Akshay kumar was a fuckboi in 90’s treated Raveena badly
hahaha raadhika apte keep doing porn movies. in them they will keep u as a lead.                                                                                           lgta hain ki ye telugu movies nahi dekhti.there are many lead actresses like anushka,samantha,nayanatara,tamanna,sai pallavi etc who did lead solo roles in many movies.even if you don&#39;t know many legendary actresses like savitri,sridevi,rekha are from telugu. now shut the fuck up and keep doing porn movies
I swear to god Prateik Babbar has suchhhhhhhhhh a sexy voice.
Ek tha tiger🐅<br>Do the back bucks🦌🦌<br><br>Aur char log gadi ke niche🚗🚗
I truly agree with Parveen Babi. Amitabh is tooooooooo overrated. I mean actors like him are responsible for regressive cinema we used to have. No respect for him
O.k.
Salman never shot the blackbuck, the animal committed suicide using his gun
Zero fucks indeed...👏
No one is saint in bolywood..<br>Amitabh bachhan v nhi.<br>Salmaan khan to bilkul hi nhi..he is a murdere...go n google about the constable who was witness of that case...
Saif Ali Khan is one actor who can turn any interview lively and interesting with his candidness irrespective of the interviewer. Then there is Shah Rukh who can outsine any criticism with Wit .
Love, love, love Kader Khan.
Bollywood is blackywood under hood
Bruh LMAO. U just didn’t have any content to post and u posted this bullshit that just wasted my time
Naseeruddin Shah&#39;s all interviews are non-stop savage moments
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=527">8:47</a> he said &quot;Drinking under Influence case&quot; 🤣🤣🤣 instead of Driving under influence.
wait, did saif undergone gay casting couch. disgusting. expose them saif
what Kader Khan was saying???? translate please
Please do watch this Song Cover, Hallejuah by Jeff Buckley.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vDqdqiuN3Y">https://youtu.be/2vDqdqiuN3Y</a>
Bhai to hindi me shoro kar
Good content dude. Rare in these days. Keep doing the good work
Drinking under Influence is a good way to stay away from legal trouble
Radhika apte acted with tollywood&#39;s biggest asshole &quot;Bala Krishna&quot; that&#39;s the reason she got that impression on tollywood......Many actress have confessed being sexual harrassed by him.....from hitting his fans to abusing women on stage......our tollywood has been degraded by him lot of times.... Don&#39;t know why people watch his films..... Forget about watching they worship him..... Bloody asshole<br><br>To the telugu people: ee baali gaani valla mana tollywood ijjath poindi..... Aadu eppud poi sasthado
Felt bad for kader khan  after watching this video R.I.P
God bless you prateek ♥️
Can you please make a video about the 100 best performance of the decade by film companion
This video without featuring interviews of Kangana which had more content then all of them put together is a joke..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=528">8:48</a> - Not drinking under influence, It&#39;s Driving under influence Moron.
I come only to hear ur voice it&#39;s lovely 😊
Bhai starting me itna mat pakaya kar ..
bro how do you make such videos
I like (and relate to) your analysis more often than not and usually your videos end up in my youtube home page which I enjoyably watch. However, this particular one felt much like a &quot;masala&quot; theme click bait rather than something that genuinely has good content. To put in my perspective a bit more clearly, one would prefer netflix over regular television to avoid such type of content. This may just be my opinion (I actually scrolled down the comments to see if anyone agreed :P) and I probably am being overly critical, but I would, however, like to know your opinion after you read this comment as to how do you compare such content with the ones you produce otherwise.
yeah its common knowledge Raveena and Akshay Kumar were together as he was with Shilpa Shetty, Mamta kulkarni, and Ayesha Jhulka...
Who shot the black buck then?
Dunno y but this upload  seemed &#39; just need to complete this assignment for tomorrow&#39;s submissions &#39; type ...lacked  ur aura
Hardik pandya s interview on kwk will top the list for eternity
U nailed it brother . . 👍👍<br><br>Great content
The thumbnail is making me shout &quot;teri aakhaya ka yo kaajal&quot;...
<b>Drinking under influence</b> 😂
since the year has almost come to an end PLEASE a huge request to make a video of best movies released this year. would help to decide a night-long binge fest 🙏🙏
This pic of yours is better than the previous one Mr. Jammypants
Can u put subs for international fans in the hindi parts
Why are you referring to people as that individual. Please use the name instead.
It&#39;s driving under influence and not drinking under influence.
Just play their clips....why are you explaining those clips.
Salman should be in jail
Not that featured...but who featured...regarding parveen babi
Are you sure? About salman
Prateek voice is amazing

Prateik Babbar is most underrated handsome actor in bollywood.
I wonder who was the lady producer Saif was talking about..
I m really a very big fan of akshay kumar ....but i feel so bad for raveena  ,,what akshay  did to her
Bhai tu sidha mudda par kyu nai aata hai .<br>Starting mey itni bakwas kyu karta hai
Why did u inserted Tridev in between Nasiruddin part..it was rude... movie was too good to be considered cringe
Bro... Do a video on downfall and rise of musicians....
Video kyu delete kiya...?😂😂.
Nice video. We need more of this.
Can Anyone Tell, Who Was Saif Talking About??
shut up you are an idiot, bollywood is art hahahahah
Why don&#39;t you review Moothon ???
Radhika said my mind out!! Pick any telegu film , it&#39;s so regressive, patriarchic,  and misogynistic most of the time!!!!!
Amitabh Bachhan may be a super star but there are many friends who he forget in their later stage of life.
Last waala mast tha 😂😂😂
Can someone explain the Salman khan part?
The guy with Saif looks like he&#39;s high!
I hope partheek makes it big he is such good actor
Drinking under influence 🙄
I can listen naseerudin shah for hours.. there&#39;s something about him.
I swear you sound drunk man
Hey! I am a BE Final year student with open elective -films and literature. Today was my final exam. The question was, “justify if movies reflect the current time we are living in” <br>When i was writting the answer i could feel in my mind how your videos have influenced my answers. When watching your movie i didnt think these videos will someday help me in exams, but it did!! So thankyou ❤️
Amitabh Bachchan was a playboy back in the days.
Isn&#39;t the last national award for best actress winner from Telugu industry? <br>Keerthi Suresh for Mahanati!
Drinking under influence <br>😂😂😂
Do memorable dialogue
Never marry a man that tells u to leave your proffession after marriage. Good for raveena.<br>Saif basically underwent a sexual harrassment.. wow.. despite being the son of famous ppl
Sorry dont mean to be mean by poking holes but Drinking under influence?
The way amitabh reacted with rekha tells everything... Rip kadar khan... U made my childhood special
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=235">3:55</a> I again misunderstood her with twinkle Khanna😅😂 I thought are ye to Akshay Kumar ki bivi hai na
Bro Kaithi (tamil)movie review
Kangana Ranaut wants to know your location <br><br>😁🤣😂
I am a huge fan of Amitabh bachchan.. I dont know much about his personal life but professionally he is one of the finest actor in Bollywood and He is indeed one of the handsomest man in Bollywood , i couldnt comprehend that why praveen babi found it bizarre.
Iam a telugu film goer.I have no idea that radhika worked in TFI.I looked up and realised that her only telugu cinema is legend with balayya and directed by boyapati. No wonder she felt so. Just wish she had met better people.
How can you miss Kangana Ranaut?
Drinking under influence 😅
I am not the driver - Salman Khan
I knew that it was someone else who shot that animal...these things make me unable to hate him somehow
Tere bhen ki chut Bajrangi bhaijaan sultan tere Naam Jaisi movies nahi dikhti laude tujhe sirf bogus bolna ATA hai chuttad saale
Salman Khan took responsibility for this and the media tried to actually hide this story. Thanks to the internet and yourself more people will now know what I saw and a genuine fact that it was not him who committed said crimes.
I&#39;m one of those people who don&#39;t like Salman Khan as a person, some of his movies (with actual stories and acting) were successful but i absolutely can&#39;t stand his behavior
Parveen Babi&#39;s claims were like the story of the wolf angoor nahi mile toh khatte hai. First she was in love with Amitabh and then when he rejected her she tried to sabotage his image. Look where Amitabh has reached and look at her
Hey,<br>I am harsh from jamshedpur , I have started watching your videos six months ago yesterday I saw one of your videos in which you were listing down some awesome thrillers and one thriller which you might have missed according to me was SAMRAT &amp; CO .<br>And i and my friend digvijay are your big fans hope you will guide us for more good movie content
Sexual harassment comes with both genders.. you don’t tell a guy to take off their shirt if the roles reversed people would have lost their shit.
Drinking under influence?
Just because ppl like Radhika Apte is outspoken doesn&#39;t mean everything she s telling is a truth
Radhika Apte generalizing an industry is simply stupid. It was like reading a page and judging whole library.
Miss you Kader Khan sir...
Saif Ali Khan&#39;s story deserved attention during the whole me too time. Why didn&#39;t men chose to speak!
start from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=120">2:00</a> is channel k host ka chutiyapa wala bakwas khatam hokar content shuru hojayega
Only Salman bhai!! Matters
You sound tired 😞<br>I mean the kind of excitement you have in your voice was not there in this video 🙂<br>What happened 🙃
so long talk n less content..
Young Raveena Tandon reminds so much of Tapsee Pannu
Could someone please explain me the Salman khan&#39;s part? I didn&#39;t follow that .<br>Why was that part even in the video? I don&#39;t get it
I know Hritik Roshan is your favorite but you could have add his controversial comment on Nepal,  where in an interview after the success of KPH said that he hates Nepal and nepali people and after that there was a rage upon his film but later manisha maam cleared his image in nepal...watch zoom story on this...
Parveen was not wrong, Amitabh wasn&#39;t that mature of an actor to have been called the star of the millennium. That been said, Amitabh currently is one of the finest actors to have ever been in Indian Cinema.
plz do the review of upcoming film &#39;yeh saali Ashiqui&#39;
Drinking under influence??? Waddddup bro? <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Clickbait bhi Kar Diya :(
Don&#39;t show andaz apana apna pic on commercial success line.
I am not a great fan of salman khan. But when he said, &quot;I wasn&#39;t the one who shot  the back buck&quot;.  His eyes was telling truth(9.10)
Radhika aapte  said about hero Baalakrishna , son of Sri.NTR. <br>I think its better not to generalise the entire Telugu industry due to one person.
Radhika apte has acted only in the LEGEND Balakrishna movies, no wonder why she feels that way.
Salman❤
Can someone translate what kadir khan said?
Salman khan&#39;s photo brought me here. Anyone else?
Nice Info, but just want to correct one thing,  Her name is Parveen Bobi, Babi.
Was Salman high
Meanwhile Salman khan: I was drunk and killed 3 things and sorted out well... <br>no f*cks given.
Drinking under influence 😂👀👀
Amit has so much to Hide that&#39;s for Sure
<b>Hey TRP,Are you Being Affected By FTC COPPA LAW</b>
Radhika Apte said , &quot; Telugu industry is patriarchal.&quot; And she was implying that female actors didn&#39;t get any influential roles. So my question is : <br><br>Weren&#39;t Baahubali and Magadheera telugu films ?  <br><br>Just curious. Not any blame. Anyone have any answers.
Salman? What???
Y u talk so slowly
wasn&#39;t WOH LAMHE movie was about parveen babi &amp; mahesh bhatt relation?
Salman said &quot; I wasn&#39;t the one who shot the black buck&quot;. What did he confess to?
Tbh I wanna know who saif was talking about and for whom did Salman took the blame for?
Salman Khan was lying!
Salman took the blame for someone else..really?
Bhai are you afraid of Akshay Kumar?
Where is Tanaji trailer review????? <br>Waiting
TRP: complains about games played during interviews <br>Also TRP:  Plays quiz with the actors of Bard of Blood in his first ever interview <br>~ JK, love your videos
radhika did only two telugu films and both of them were with balakrishna. uhmmm.....what were you expecting ?
Drinking under influence: Means taking the second drink
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wpOxG5GFA&amp;t=528">8:48</a> drinking under influence ?? driving hai<br>nice video tho &lt;3
Salman kiske baare me ishaara KR RHA tha...<br>Kisne shoot Kiya tha...

Parveen Babi was a bitch! Amtabashen is the best! Jealous person. What a bitchy comment she made. She was  just a  eye candy and Amtabashen Sab, is a versatile and a legend actor.🎉🎆🎉
Radhika is overrated
make tanhaji trailer review
Soooo... did katappa kill the blackbuck??
Simi Garewal’s interviews were insightful.
Kader khan is Dead,say was not is dumbo
Parveen babi was so funny
I came to watch this vid praying saala 2 minute ka intro nahi hoga, bhai direct point pe aana, you&#39;re losing me! You&#39;ve already annoyed enough !
Just say her boyfriend was Akshay Kumar. When you are too afraid to take names, that&#39;s how they get away with worse stuff.
Saif ali khan made it clear<br>Men are victims too
Kudos to you for ur hard work
You should have include the interview of Anushka Sharma with Film companion, where she talked about her lip surgery and about her relationships
Last time I was that early.. Jo Jo siwa had a hairline 😂
Can&#39;t stand the sight of him!
<b>If you really want an experience of an insightful interview do watch Guftagoo on Rajyasabha tv channel. Where interviewer Irfan saab quintessentially asks some deep questions and the celebrities chat and answer with grace and sheer intelligence!</b>
Isko hindi me bhi upload kar diya kar gadhe...
Tanaya se breakup hogaya kya
Tridev, an Embarrassing film ???Dude, I think its time for you to stop substance abuse. Its a great movie. Fun Masala action! Most would struggle to achieve it&#39;s success. Har jagah iranian cinema mat ghusado!
You also did the same when you inteviews bard of the blood cast xD
&quot;Abbu nahi maneenge &quot;
It’s shocking for the masses even in this day and age that their favorite actors can be assholes in real life.
Watch guftagoo on Rajya Sabha TV.  They do great interviews.
Bhot din Baad kuch dhang ka content
Kader Khan was salty
Hey please make video on best indian web series across all factors.
Dude shorten ur intros we don&#39;t even care about the intro. Just get straight to the first point.
Last one was really epic stuff 🤙🤙
Telling a guy to take your shirt off is still sexual harassment
Tried and Refused Production : Salman said he dint shoot black buck<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Am I a Joke to you</b>
Radhika apte did her telugu film with Balakrishna . Yeah i can imagine her struggle.
Where is Kangana Ranuat you dumbass????? 🤔🤔🤔🤔... . Who is showing the all the ugly reality of film industry from the past 3-4 years...
Who was in a relationship with Raveena Tandon?
Amitabh is not a legend. He&#39;s a scumbag.
Amit ji is overrated<br>He&#39;s good <br>Very professional and there&#39;s a reason <br>Why he&#39;s successful <br><br>No one can take this away <br>From him<br><br>But then again he is overrated
Don&#39;t know big b as a person but he is definitely a brilliant actor. Man can pull off commercial Biggie&#39;s and parllel/offbeat films with very ease
I actually thought Salman&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m a Virgin&quot; would make the list....
Drinking under influence???
Parveen Babi suffered from schizophrenia. She always felt her life to be in danger.
Sad😔 Did any one know this reality about parveen babi, Five years later, due to a shortage of land space for burials, Parveen Babi&#39;s grave along with other luminary Bollywood celebrities such as Mohammed Rafi, Madhubala, Sahir Ludhianvi, Talat Mahmood, Naushad Ali who were interred at Santa Cruz Muslim Cemetery, were exhumed and their remains were disposed of (relocated) to provide space for new burials.
Make a vedio on biggest sex scandals happened in bollywood
wow i was the 1K like..
I made it 1K likes😭💓

Whom Raveena is talking about?? Akshay Kumar??
Salman khan can&#39;t stand da sight of him 😂😂😂well said ❤❤❤
Kangana Ranaut deserves a video of her own
How come KANGANA RANAUT didnt feature in ur list, its just impossible.<br><br>Her all interviews r fire, but her Aap Ki Adalat appearance set a blast allover.
U should watch ayushmans interview with neelsh misra....very very nice.....defines why ashymaan is so loved 🙌🙌😍😍😍
Waiting for ur video. And finally!!
Respect for kadar khan sahaab , RIP sir
I’d like to add that the movies Radhika Apte chose in Telugu industry were the wrong ones. I mean there are other directors who aren’t so regressive. I get that she didn’t know about Balayya since she wasn’t from Andhra. I feel sorry for her, she really got the raw deal from our industry.
PARVEEN BABI CONFESSION WAS SOMEWHAT HER OWN OPINION BUT NOT OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN INDIA.... BUT WE RESPECT UR THOUGHT MA&#39;AM AFTER ALL YOU HAD  WORKED IN MANY HIT MOVIES TOGETHER ...
Who cares everbody in for the money<br>including u md and everbody
I believe there r so many ugly stories hidden about Amitabh Bachan
Saif Ali Khan Is Most Honest Guy ....
It is funny how Salman got several backlash for Blackbuck and accident things,which had no witness,but None said him anything when he was creating problem in the set of Aishwraya. ...May be Patriarchy.
90s man....crap all over...Informative video👌👌👌Saif Ali Khan and Naseruddin Shah&#39;s confessions were hilarious..Radhika aapte is a genius in every manner..
Watch in 2x .! And Help Me Later .!
Well I must agree.. Amitabh Bachchan is not among the Top 10 handsome men.🙈🙈🙈.. If I have to make my Top 10 handsome men till 1980s then it would be Bharat Bhusan, Dharmendra,Jeetendra,Rajesh khanna, Sashi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna, Guru Dutt, Shammi Kapoor,Anil Kapoor, Kishore Kumar.
I do agree with her that it is hilarious that Mr Amitab Bacchan was one of the 10 handsome man 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Raveena Tandon&#39;s bf was Akshay Kumar........ You can say so.
At 8.49,its not drinking under the influence,its driving under the influence.
