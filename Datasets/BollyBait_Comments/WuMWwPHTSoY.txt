My go-to movie whenever I feel depressed and dissatisfied with ongoing stuffs
Fruits as Vegetables ❤️❤️❤️ Tomato, Brinjal, Cucumber,Beans, Lady&#39;s finger,etc. Flowers change into fruits. Some fruits are eaten raw and fresh. Apple,peach,pear,Mango,Banana,Chickoo,Guava,Grapes,Orange,papaya, Watermelon, Litchi,etc. are fruits. Fruits are rich in sugars,vitamins and minerals. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Since early times,FIROZ has been famous for spices, textiles, jewellery and pearls. The Arabs were among the first to came to Asia through the Asian Ocean for trade. Later,the Portuguese traded in Goa as early as 1510. They founded three other colonies on the west coast in Diu,Bassein and Mangalore. 👍👍👍👍👍

Those laughs, those dinners all that moments all fresh in mind ..<br><br>Its 2023 hopefully we will make another foreign trip probably soon  to Australia this time🤞🤞..
10 years and since this song buzzes through my head sometimes. It truely shows the true aspect of life .
Remember seeing it for the first time when I was 13-14 years old on its tv premiere , those were the good days
Bas gane me hi ja sakte hai 😅
Life transitions too soon from Farhan&#39;s way to Hrithik&#39;s way of living as you age!🥲
In spain right now and listening to this on loop!

After years of listening to this song and watching movie <br>I&#39;ve decided to enjoy life more and be much cheerful person. Doing what i like (hobby) and of course who doesnt like to travel 🤪
Remembering a trip that never happened 😇😇
I am in Germany and planning to go for a trip with friends.
Hritik&#39;s approach towards life is what reality is!!!!

Imran&#39;s charachter is motivating.... ❤️
This is the song which inspired me to leave my job and go to Spain to enjoy La Tomatina (because my manager wasn’t approving my leaves lol). It all happened in 2016. The most memorable trip of my life with 2 other friends. The ZNMD trip of my life !! I’ll go again when I am old. There will be wrinkles on my face but I am sure my spirit will remain the same 😌

We want ZNMD2
Spain ja rhy hay hum.log
I play this song when i have to pack my bag for the trip, believe me its quiet efficient for packing purpose
Who I want to be when packing : Hrithik<br>Who I really am when packing : Farhaan
There is only one life just go for everything you can😇. ZMD ALL TIME BEST MOVIE ❤️
Why does this sound like “wake up sid” (some parts)
कौन कौन अपने फ़्रेंड्स ❤साथ घूमने❤जाना पसंद करता है 🙄 और कमेंट पड़ने वाले आप स्मार्ट हो तो कमेंट करना 😂 नहीं होगा स्मार्ट तो चुप रहोगे 😄
I have planned a trip to Spain in the year 2026 for my bachelorette with 2 of my friends, in the year which this movie will complete its 15 years. Oh,it would be so fun!
Listening this while traveling to airport to catch up an early morning flight (first flight tbh - solo). What a feel! :P
ZNMD and YJHD are emotions ❤️ Bollywood won&#39;t make this type of movies again.....💔
Aditya yogi n Draupadi murmu take away film making rights from Farhan Akhtar for another 100 year
I watched the ZNMD last night and it refreshed my mind ….in fact thinking the life of Katrina it’s pretty Kool <br>Just live your life guys take a break and go somewhere unknown <br>It’s so much fun to explore new things <br>I m gonna do that have been to Spain before why not another trip <br>We have only one life let’s live it <br>Cheers<br>X
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=204">3:24</a> was abhay deol’s real visa stamping
💕💕💕💕💕💕
Such films should be made
Thank you Kavyashree🌻 Znmd my all time fav movie❤
Hope this song was a little longer than it is
The vibe of guitar bass and lead along with drum make this song beautiful loved it...
I think this movie should be made again set in according to 2020s era. This movie is from 2010 things had quiet change since then.
Finally I&#39;m in Spain. <br>But the &#39;s&#39; is silent.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=39">0:39</a> this is the best part
Friends, if you get to travel throughout the world do travel. I have so far travelled to 21 international destinations. Travelling has helped me a lot in improving myself. It will also help you a lot. So don&#39;t miss an opportunity to travel.
Thank you so much for I could watch this film in a theatre in Japan. This is my memorial film which I watched in 2011 with my friend in India.(at home)<br>She explained to me whole story because I could not understand Hindi at all.<br>Lots of love from Japan.
💙💚🤗🤗

This movie and song have definitely taught me to live my life to the fullest.
Hrithik&#39;s closet is more organized than my life .
I wish after some years I can also go to a trip like this with my friends.
Joy Barua is a gem 🖤

ZNMD will always be remain my one of the fav. Bolly film❤
🖤

Way way ahead of its time

People like Hrithik will think 100 times before helping, are reserved kinda and people like Farhan are always ready to help anytime or any adventure or trip....
Zindagi na milegi dobara and yeh jawani hai deewani are my all time favorite Bollywood films❤❤❤
I went paris or las Vegas like this
Finally going on a Solo trip to Spain after watching this song and mesmerizing it sitting on the side window of the bus while returning from college 💕💕💕❤️
Samay Aana Par Ham Bhi Niklenga Europe With Buddies
I would say these three are the main hero of this movie 🍿 abhey<br>Farhan <br>Hrithik Roshan
Please release it once again in theaters
Energy next level🔥🔥🔥
Here After Shobhit Bhaiya Video
It remember me toyoto ad

Hrithik- Another level
One of my favourite
Spain 🇪🇸
❣️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=100">1:40</a>
Love this song ❤️
Beautiful 😍❤
The song is shot so beautifully and accurately. Abhay being chauffeur driven to airport and travelling in 1st class. Hrithik packing perfectly everything and that too at night before sleeping, disciplined and focused like his character. He flies business and like a workaholic works on his laptop and at the end picks up a business magazine. Farhan packing at the last moment, forgetting his passport and then flirting with steward in flight, so like him (I mean character’s).<br>Hats off to Zoya.
This song makes me wanna travel. Hit like if you listening in 2022.
Mene to kuch bhi nahi dekha par chahti hu koi aisa jivan saathhi mile jo duniya ke safar pr sath chale...
I&#39;ve been dreaming of going on big adventure someday and doing my best for it but whenever I loose confidence and think about giving up, this song keeps my dream alive 😍
Missing childhood days badly 😓<br>Many childhood memories with this Masterpiece song 😭😭😭kaash woh din waps ate 2010 days
Legend movie 🎥
Znmd is 💓
still listening to thiss
Great movie, don&#39;t mind watching it 100 times 😂😍
Lovely  song 🎵 ❤ 💕
❤❤🙏🙏🙏
The personality and the demeanor of each of the three stand out in stark parallel to how they live and behave, and how they change at the end of the film.<br><br>Arjun is disciplined, yet a workaholic who has trouble communicating his feelings and is not able to separate his personal and professional life. He loves to enjoy life but always lets his views on being successful and rich get in the way. Despite that, he gains a new lease on his life after he meets Laila, overcomes his fears, and finally finds her as a life partner. <br><br>Imran is the polar opposite of Arjun, though doing decent, he&#39;s haphazard, wayward, flirty, and a womanizer, who gets on people&#39;s nerves. Yet his skill for poems is appreciated but he is not able to do anything regarding them, but he&#39;s a good friend who knows how to have fun, same as Kabir. After meeting his biological father, he realizes his mistakes and finally reconciles with Arjun, and starts a true relationship with Nuria.<br><br>Kabir, ever the middleman and mediator of the group, is a combination of Arjun and Imran. Diligent and organized yet a complete prankster when needed, he nevertheless is caught in the middle between his and his girlfriend&#39;s families and is not able to juggle both, leading to him leaning on his friends for support. It takes a combination of his friends and his own efforts to finally tell Natasha that he can&#39;t marry her, and in the end, contrary to Arjun and Imran, who have found love, he finds happiness and independence. <br><br>This movie is a fucking masterpiece.
We visited Spain in 2019 after years of loving this movie. We watched it again there in our hotel. I was crying of joy.
💜
9ys already but this movie helps me a lot about friendship and hardship that we have to earn🤫🤫😅🙏✌️😋😇😇
Are there some people that listen to this in 2022
Facing our fears is the ultimate love we can ever experience...handsdown znmd for life !
This song reminds me of how I should live my life. Running my own race, exploring myself, being different from the crowd, not caring about other&#39;s opinions of me, being truly happy in the moment. Javed Akhtar, you&#39;re a lyrical genius. ❤
👍
while going for trip packing expectations ritik roshan..reality farhan akhtar
Remember bagwati?

Came here after watching the movie again.. masterpiece in true sense🔥❤️
ZNMD is such an amazing movie that IT NEVER GETS BORING!
The direction for this song is super impressive. On one side, there is Hritik with everything perfection and on the contrast, Farhan with everything messed up.
This film was inspiring 🤩<br>I still watch it for time to time to feel it again
Anyone in dec 2021 ? <br>New start with a new year 😉
Farhan flirting with the air hostess lmaooo

This movie deserves an oscar
Anyone watching in 2021
The way they leave for the trip ( and pack)  tells us so much about the lead characters ☺️
Problem is Not Everyone is friends group can get this rich, aur kisi ki toh shaadi bhi ho jaata h<br>so Plan Adhoora rehta h
abhay came in first class hrithik in business class and farhan in economy class

That pique and xavi jersey scene give peace to my mind like really
I reached Spain finally. It was a dream after watching this movie.
Jinko ache dost mil jae wohi thik hai spain jane se
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=107">1:47</a> farhans smile
i am going to watch this movie again!
Listening this song at night- <b>NOSTALGIC</b>
Awesome song
When i first watched that movie i was 13 that time i decided my life should be like this..still working on it ♥️
I am listening this song in a Spain road trip 2 years ago It was amazing
In  movies everything will be good in reality if  he has job life will be good
so, i also have a trio me and me and my two bsf, they are both very studious and talented with a goal in their life and they are going to be like hritik and abhay while im the dumb and funny one like farhan and like him i also write poems!!!but we still manage to get along loll
The Dil Chahta Hai of younger generation.
I&#39;ll be honest, I learned to pack bags from Hrithik Roshan. <br>Ps. I bought my mum similar &quot;bagwati&quot; he bought, packed in bag almost like him.
Anyone in july 2021?
finally going to spain nex week
Finally going to US🙌🤩
One of my most favourites !! ❤️❤️
Hrithik&#39;s costume throughout the movie shows his character development. At the start he is this organised guy with tight fitting clothes, which shows he is locked up in his profession. As the movie progresses, he becomes unorganised, his clothes become loose, showing that his character has started living in the moment
Masterpiece
The way Hrittik arranged his things!!
HAPPY 10YRS TO THIS GREAT AND AWESOME MOVIE ❤❤❤❤❤😍😍
My dream is to Spain and take a bunglow
This is the best song I jave heard
Nostalgia 💕.  This movie is a very nice feel gud movie. But now bollywood movies are just crap 🙄
Still now its impact on our heart...<br>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖

A legend can hear this masterpiece song and movie even after 10 years of its release❤️❤️❤️
10 Years of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaraa from 15th July 2011 to 15 th july 2021 . A decade has passed ,many thing has changed but one thing remain constant for me,The Inspiration from ZNMD. In the last decade i got close to my inspiration and hope within the coming decade I will be able to take Some Schengen trips and complete the madness just as like of ZNMBD
10 years of ZNMD!
2001 - 2011<br>Dil Chahta Hai - Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara<br>Farhan Akhtar - Zoya Akhtar<br>Aamir Khan - Hrithik Roshan<br>Saif Ali Khan - Abhay Deol<br>Akshaye Khanna - Farhan Akhtar<br>Preity Zinta - Katrina Kaif
Ok I can see India&#39;s aesthetic people in the comment section ✨😤, cause it&#39;s 2021 and you people are not over the gaga feeling about this MOVIE and it&#39;s songs!

This song is better than Badshah&#39;s career

One day I will go Spain and I wish I will be same prepared for my destination

My favourite movie
Kukky op
Hey hey corona
Hrithik&#39;s shocking face when he realized he has to accommodate that &quot;Hermes&quot; Bag in his lugguage :D :D
I just love this song and the movie ❤️😌
Expectation of wardrobe - Hritik<br>Reality- Farhan😂😂😂
Farhan went airport without passport and at cheking he realized he forgot his passport and went home again 😳
Imran, Kabir and Arjun, welcome to Spain.
This song always runs fresh in my mind ❤️
During pendemic like Corona..<br><br>Are you getting the right meaning of this movie?<br>&quot;Zindagi na milegi dobara&quot;❤️
He is like business MAN
I like the scene of<br>Farhad khan and air horstis<br>Where talking<br>And hrithik was turning off light
This music feels going to airport and Go for travelling high way<br>Going on road trips<br>So goooddddd
Someone want to explain the meaning?
He looks handsome
I like hirthik roshan <br>He came in Free fire
Did you remember the scene of bagmeti 😂😂

Abhay Deol was traveling in First Class <br>Hrithik in business class <br>Farhan in economy class
Just look at the total contrast of personalities of Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar by the way they pack their stuff
Look how Farhan packing his clothes. His charecter is like me only.
Only for joy baruah 🙂❤️
I listened this Song more than 100 times and today i am in different country..!!<br>Law of attraction really works..
Hrithik is so sorted. And the way he arranges his belongings! ✨
Why this song have just 14M views and other Aakhmare , gaandmare songs have millions views 🤔

Love this song!  However, I edit video for a living, and I feel like from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=46">0:46</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=51">0:51</a> is missing at least ONE clip as the chorus swells!  I understand the jump cut technique that the editor was using here, but for some reason, that segment feels like it&#39;s missing something.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=104">1:44</a> That smile Farhan Akhtar versatile actor....!!!!!
Khel kyu na koi yesa khele jisme hi ho saabi ki jeet ❤️

I&#39;m listening to this song as I know that &quot;zindegi na milegi doobara&quot;. :)
Still love this song ❤️❤️
My most favorite song.
বহুতে গম এ নেপাই যে এই গানটি অসমৰ জয় বৰুাইও গাইছে
Kab tak ginne hum dhadkane.. dil jaise dhadke dhadakne do... Hits me
Really love this movie. My fav after DCH
Zoya akhtar is amazing ❤
Love from Indonesia, i love this movie and songs
Does anyone else feel like anything is possible in this world at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=46">00:46</a> or is it just me?
Hritik divorced...Farhan divorced...Abhay broke up... katrina broke up ....Kalki divorced...<br>ZOYA single forever (or secretly married)<br><br><b>Time for Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara sequel</b>
It’s 2020 and almost 8years have gone but still I feel the same craze while listening...this is just fav 💙
Listened it to throw away the fear of flying. Like it&#39;s now or never!!<br><br>It inspires me to live fully and enjoy the moments and of course to travel!!
Music is copied from gangbeasts video game...🤔🤔🤔

No doubt, this is one of the gem movie of Bollywood.

Most ENERGETIC SONG! Hit like if u agree
this is awesome
No one is appreciating the great work done by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. They lifted this movie to another level........
Amazing movie, lyrics, music, actors, director, locations, shayaris,.....list goes on.
kon kon lockdown mai sun ra h
86,000 positive cases! But ZNMD will never stop being my favorite of all time!
Everones dream...
This movie is one of the  best movie of Bollywood
This song, and a roadtrip with your lovely friends❤️pefect match
Listening to this song during quarantine
One of the best songs, an also the movies is great, I don&#39;t like &quot;buddy movies&quot; but every time when I watch this movie I want to go on a trip with my friends, have fun, the actors, Hritik, Farhan, and Abhay did it awsome, but also the director Zoya Akhtar did a perfect job with the story the way to tell the story, the messege, the humor, this film it&#39;s perfect yo have fun and laught, for me is one of the best films of Zoya Akhtar
this movie made me realize, hrithik can&#39;t act. he can flex his body, can dance 110%, but he is vomit in this movie.
What a songs!! Friends on europe trip.. And everytime I ask my friends for any trip, I get to hear &#39;paise nhi hai&#39;.. somebody should adopte us so that we can afford for trips.
Reminds me of the many trips to different places in India , my friends and I undertook, and of course the many episodes of getting drunk in Goa, Kerala etc etc
Is it just me or is roshan always looking serious lol 😝
I can surely tell that this is one of the best indian movie
who is listening this during quarantine?
ZNMD is an master peice such a wonderful ful movie i must say gem ❤️❤️❤️💕
Who is listening this song in quarantine 😂😂....?
ZNMD is that movie which I can watch anytime, anywhere, and still feel good. <br>This movie just has a different feeling and vibe to it, it makes you realize how important life is and how important it is to spend your time doing the things you love. <br>One of the best Bollywood movie in my opinion.
What happens to Bollywood now? Really!! They are just appointing Tanishk Bagchi who has no ideas of original music and always make remakes. Bollywood should appoint Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy for best music and this message is especially for T-Series(Hit like and reply if you agree)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1uJlZ4_guU">https://youtu.be/B1uJlZ4_guU</a><br><br>I&#39;ve made a song in quarantine <br>using ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA<br>and guess what .....<br>people loved it
How is that this song only has 11M views, when it should be 1B
Sum41 into the deep

Me and my 2 frds hoing to canada after 7 months my mind is think in this video we are in
When everyone came up with romcoms and action movies, Zoya Akhtar came up with movie on friends road trip. The movie released at the time when there is no culture of road trip in India. This is one of the best Bollywood movie.
Ah.. the good old times when music was actually good.. now it feels like shitloads of bullcrap
This movie taught me best meaning of life
Anyone missing travelling? ☹️<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23quarantine">#quarantine</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23covid">#covid</a>_19

Turn on captions to enjoy more🤣🤣🤣

Have watched this movie over 20 times still everytime I watch this movie it feels like I&#39;m watching it for the very first time.
Who wants to travel with friends in Europe but don’t have money like me 😂<br>( btw I live in Europe 😉)
bagwati :D
Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara is one of my most favourite <a href="http://films.it/">films.It</a> has a social message that you only live <a href="http://once.so/">once.So</a> make the most of this life and never have regrets.👍👌💐👍👍
Which scale is these<br>2020 feb
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=100">1:40</a> Farhan almost forgets his passport while going on a trip to spain. Such a messy character 😂😂😂😂
Expectation: Hrithik Wardrobe<br>Reality: Farhan Akhter wardrobe 🥺
Best movie ever made in Bollwood.
Seat belt scene was best
most refeshing song on internet
Zoya Akhtar knows how to make a good movie
Wardrobe Expectation: Hrithik sirs<br>Wardrobe Reality: FaRhAnS <br><br><br>😄 😅 😆<br>Edit #1: Thank You so Much for the 150 Likes! It&#39;s not much but it means a lot to me :)
jaha mere kapdo ka sapne pure hotee hai hritik ka struggle shuru hota hai....
I don&#39;t know what Arda Turan is doing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuMWwPHTSoY&amp;t=135">2:15</a>.
No matter how people gyrate about &#39;Gully Boy&#39;, ZNMD will forever remain Zoya Akhtar&#39;s best work ever.<br><br>Edit : Wow, 3K likes! I have never had so many likes in any of my comments. Goes on to show how much love ZNMD gets, almost 10 years since it released. Keep the love flowing!
Perhaps 1 of the best self realization movie.
Bollywood&#39;s greatest movie
Anyone from 2020
