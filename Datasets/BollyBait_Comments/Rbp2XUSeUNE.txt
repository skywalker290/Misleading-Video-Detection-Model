amazing,fab wonderful movie!!!!A must watch :D

wish if i could dance like her.mind blowing 


wish if i could dance like her.mind blowing yaar
Saw the film. Expected to hate it. Was actually likable but nothing beyond that. Unoriginal to the hilt, cliched, too long &amp; about 40mins of it was songs. Kalki was amazing. The friendship between her, Aditya (who was great) &amp; Ranbir was the best part. Deepika was good. Ranbir did more acting in the Bombay Talkies song, his role was that unremarkable. Romance was ok but nothing special. It went to love in seconds &amp;didn&#39;t explain why. And why anyone would fall for a guy called Bunny is beyond me.
#Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani Scored 75cr In Four Days ! That&#39;s Pretty Huge ! I Was Crying The Whole Day Because I Coudn&#39;t Watch It #Houseful# .Question : How Come It Has 1300 Dislikes o_O

@meghasaini hhahahah same here first wanted to see this bcuz it looked fun and crazy but then bcuz awsum young jodi..after watching aashiqui 2 (god knows how many times) I got more interested for aditya roy kapoor and watching the trailer over &amp; over bcuz of him! XD
Each and every scene in this trailer reminds me of some scene of yash chopra or karan johar&#39;s earlier films. Though I am a RK fan, I don&#39;t think I will waste my time on this one.

very dull promo 
ranbirs too cool

Mujhe tumse pyaar ho jayega...Phir se

Never thought the movie would be so good. At least that is what I feel from the trailer. This comes from a production house which has given some of the best emotional movies like Yash Chopra. The movie is refreshing, it has a soul. I am sure it will connect with the youth and also people who have a  heart or soul which does not wish to grow old. 

this is gonna be the coolest summer.
this is gonna be the coolest suMMer
this is gonna be the coolest suMMer ...
