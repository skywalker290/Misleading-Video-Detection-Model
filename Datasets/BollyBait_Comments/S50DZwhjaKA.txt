So basically..a guy flirting with you when he was dating someone else was what made you feel special??
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=169">2:49</a>.. He was flirting with her while dating someone else😑
Deepika padusingh kon wife of ranveer padusingh ✌️
She has married one of the most attractive and stylish men in Bollywood.❤
Bare sistar he Deepika Padukone ki
Nothing going back 50 years she is really stupid on that. Sex is utmost thing in a relationship with anyone makes it less valuable and once anything is less valuable people do it easily and hence cheating became very common . Physical stuff is meant to be in between two couple . And also if you share your body with anyone then just like every thing in the universe if it is accessible to anyone around or you can say to more people it is obvious the body becomes less worthy and be it any gender. If a guy had many relationships in past but want someone to be pure than it is wrong but if any of gender believed in genuine relationship and wants the same quality for their partner then there is nothing wrong. Now i would also like to say who is at fault , i believe we all are . Mostly actors - how ? -. They do physical stuff and intimacy and justify it in the name of art or job but i would say job is not the ultimate thing in the world that you can do anything in the name of it. Common people watch it and repeat the same thing and again like i said before it makes utmost thing less valuable.
Deepika❤️❤️❤️
Deepika has the guts to redefine the surname change to be for a man rather than a woman is all because she married Ranveer who will accept it, nahi tho in this male chauvisnist society who accepts it, another husband or his family would call wife proudish and rude..
Bollywood Shahenshah Dilip Kumar and badshah Shahrukh Khan are the permanent bollywood kings for all time (from 1913 to 2022 and to the end of bollywood), because highest (8) filmfare awards for best actor champions🏆/most (8) filmfare awards for best actor winners🏆 are Shanenshah Dilip Kumar and badshah Shahrukh Khan. Shahenshah Dilip Kumar: 1954 daag, 1956 azad, 1957 devdas, 1958 naya daur, 1961 kohinoor, 1965 leader, 1968 ram aur shyam and 1983 shakti. Badshah Shahrukh Khan: 1994 bazigar, 1996 dilwale dulhania le jayenge, 1998 dil to paagal hay, 1999 kuch kuch hoota hay, 2003 devdas, 2005 swades, 2008 check de india and 2011 my name is Khan.
dear all people they people are rich
She has always problem with Ranveer Singh&#39;s surname she never proudly accept like other actress like Kareena Kapoor Khan and Priyanka Chopra Jonas Whoever addresses her like Deepika Padukone Bhavani Singh, she interrupts them. I mean I don&#39;t understand At least once, with love, Say with your name by putting his surname.but no even he has no problem with addressing him Ranveer Singh Padukone he love her so much ❤️ he literally adore the floor that she walks on 😩 she don&#39;t deserve him 🙌
Thumbnail is very similar to Ulay, Oh ♥️
A girl a lady a woman always will choose,choses or love that man who will respect her the most ..love obviously..but respect is extremely important not only for the girl herself but also towards her family and her decisions..and this exactly where mr ranveer singh actually scored.<br>Contrary to Ranbir kapoor who basically flirts with his girlfriends before becoming girlfriends,then one night stands and kick them out...
sala sabhi interviewers gay hi kyu hote he 😂😂😂😂😂😂
😍😍😍😍😍
deepika is so energetic...and ranveer too
I lover how she said &quot;Deepika Padukone, wife of Ranveer Singh Padukone&quot;. I LOVE HER!!
Queen 👑

This anchor behavior like saroj khan and has aunty kind of vibes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=252">04:12</a> Deepika should handle trolls  more wisely. Replying that you have immense and huge money only makes your image silly.Always remember,if you feel proud and  rich, you should have people around who have more. Every person is tiny in compared to someone in this <a href="http://universe.so/">universe.So</a> don&#39;t feel so superior,afterall the love,hatred,trolls of these people only make you guys the stars. And one more thing, if you have so much,try to donate some to our country  in these hard corona times ,what&#39;s the point in smoking &quot;maal&quot; and be proud of your money??
Love you deepveer ♥️
Good. Speaking. Very. happy. I.am.been

What&#39;s beautiful about sindoor it&#39;s just a border line drawn by a man addressing a line which you can t cross like a tiger mark his territory with his urine exactly like that
Aabe o angrej hindi bhi thora bol le 🤗
Deepika padukone is the best always ❤😍
Deepika Padukone Singh Bhabnani.
Boycott bollywood and druggies.justice for our SSR
I feel Very happy for her❣️
The host is more like a girl 😂
Both druggie nashedi murdere married to eachother.. best jodi 🤣😂
Trop belle ma chérie je. T aime bcp
Wow.. People&#39;s are following supporters of tukade tukade gang.... Greedy lady Mrs. Padukone.. No respect for you..
Ranvir Singh dipika ke layak nhi hai
Dipika ko Ranvir  kapoor ke sath shadi karni chahiye thi
Deepika 👌
Galat dumb logo ke paas itna paisa hain. Agar scientists ke paas itna paisa hota toh desh ka bhala ho jata. Yeh sadharan log sirf apne Expenseses ko fulfill karne mein hi lage rehte hain. Western culture spread kar rahe hain yeh dumb log.
Sale industry mein sab ke sab Karan Johar hi hai 😂🤣
Such pathetic questions for an extremely talented person like DP..!!!
Love u Deepika
All these due to drugs druggie deepika acting karthr hey jn all time
She looks as if she&#39;s always on drugs!!

So sweet n looking very happy.Stay blessed n happy always <a href="http://amen.love/">Amen.Love</a> you Deepika n Ranveer .Most gorgeous couple in the world💕
cRAZy, crazy, pagal girl and that pagol journalist....but enjoyed the show....
How casually she said, &quot;He was flirting with me even though he was dating someone else.&quot; He is a dog and you are a bitch. I would judge a person who would flirt with me when they are dating someone else. When Ranbir did the same she went around crying.
💊Drug dealer hai kya
Cahres pipike shyakal vi bandar jaisa hogai
Ask her now will be surprised
Chiiiiii deepikaaaa chiiiiiiii
Ab isi tarah jabawb denaa NcB kai saath good luck gajairi maal hai kyaa😃😃😃
Druggie padukone......
Hated
FK her accent and diction is sooo THICK! you would think shes taking the mickey out of an indian accent until you learn hold on! that really is actually the way she talks!!!!! hehehehehe loooool...   she sounds horrible man  bharo my maang loooooool   its BYOOORAFULL
Who noticed her bangles?..
Anyone in lockdown..?
elmo
She is not Dippika ,her name is Deepika (as in Deeepika).
She is nice and all, but what exactly is she wearing ?? She should fire her stylist !!
What a bull shit questions  ..nonsense  ..
India lost a national treasure, Sushant Singh Rajput. Bollywood lost an icon. Not one word from filthy Ranveer Singh &amp; his likes!!! Down with Zoya &amp; Farhan Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, Shabans Azmi for supporting the influential criminals guilty of murdering a national treasure, an icon, a legend, Sushant Singh Rajput. You chose to side with the oppressor and the murderers. We will remember where you stand on this. It is NOT a witch hunt or a media trial as you would like to portray on your fictional narrative. It’s but the opposite. If this was Farhan hanging from the ceiling fan, would you claim the same position?!Hypocrisy! All Bollywood celebrities have shown their true colors...Bachan family, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor; not one word requesting inquiry into a murdered legend, SSR. Complete boycott of Bollywood, do not click on any of their videos, do not view, do not comment, do not like or dislike. We, the Indian masses will not be silenced or distracted or fooled by Rhea, Pithani, Pancholi, Khan, Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena, Baby Penguin, Mumbai Police. Indians, all over the world have their eyes on Republic TV, Ujjwal Trivedi, Ishkaran Bhandari, the Supreme Court of India and CBI. Maharashtra Govt and Mumbai police are involved and protecting the true criminals. They have reasons to cover up the murder of a legend. All their actions and mishandling of the case are evidence enough of their guilt. Shameful that major Indian media channels are still not giving SSR the fair share of coverage. They’re scared...just like the Bollywood celebrities. If SSR fails to get justice, the common man of India will have no shot at justice ever again. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalprayers4ssr">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a>

I just always get irritated when deepika speaks ,and what was the need for saying that ranveer singh padukone thing ,its very ok if she doesn&#39;t wants to take her husbands surname but doing this drama isn&#39;t cool😐😑😶🙄
His voice nd his body never matches
That somebody that Ranveer was dating was Anuskha!
Ranbir kapoor
Wake up to each other legally
😍😍😍😘
Deepika is so beautiful
Arshad khan padokon
I hate this guy for showing hina khan down because she debuted in Cannes !
Love ranveer more than deepika cz he is more humble more oving and more cheerful
Deepika has great beauty physical and inspirational 💖💖💖
Ranveer Singh is the most sexiest man in the world,...❤️❤️...and Deepika Padukone is the most beautiful lady in the world 💜💜💜<br>BEST COUPLE IN BOLLYWOOD ✌️
God tumhe aise hi khush rkhe.kisi se dhoka Milne k bad god ne tumhe.ranveer jaisa carying hubby dya. God bless u

So instant answers<br>I liked and name changed ideology
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=188">3:08</a> The same incident was said by Ranveer in another interview😂😂
Everything will vanish.. Wait for 3 or 4 years.. Love will vanish.. Bade logo ki badi baateein..
The host is so funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Deepika ma&#39;am ne amazing rply diyaa.... 🤣😂
I think this is the only interview, which deepika actually enjoyed..her smile is so pure here!!<br>Love Filmfare.
So much better than  stupid interviews of other channels 💓 loved it ♥️♥️
I think deepika padukone has more fans than aishwarya rai
The way she was talking about him made my heart warm❤️
Hypocritic randi dumped pandya fr ranbir.
Cutie
I am big fan of uu mam i really love uuu mam
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49GTTwAoNN0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49GTTwAoNN0</a>
Be a Indian u should speak in Hindi so everyone can understand
Please please please anyone translate Anchor&#39;s question about trolls.   I couldnt understand hindi
Raveer Singh padukone, wtf! So deepika is the dominant partner in this relationship. I&#39;m really disappointed with u ranveer .
Why is the interviewer talking to Deepika like she is a bachha?
She is awesome, I like her, 😂 😂 😂
Who thinks Deepika savage level1000 when she said<br>Take it out of my mouth
I don&#39;t understand why &quot;we went back 15 years&quot;. No gurl, a no kissing &quot;policy&quot; is totally normal logical and understandable 😑
Deepika, I think Ranveer not scare with you. But he&#39;s very love you if a man really loves you🥰 Especially when you are depressed, he was by your side at that time. So Ranveer doesn&#39;t want to see you sad. He will never hurt you and does not want to lose you😉 he will give you happiness in the future😇😇😇
Next interview after divorce
💕💕
Nice answers mam &amp; love u mam so much💕💕💕
You are so pretty dipika mam lov you so much I&#39;m from Nepal 💌
Bharo maag mere bharo 😂
Don&#39;t trolled Deepika..she is so pretty..
Look at the posture of the host. RIP Everything.
Main aapko copy kar rahi thi😂😂🤣🤣
Her answers on troll😌😌😘 <br>I love u so much my deeps🤗🤗😍
Ranveer was flirting when he was in some other relationship and it was special for dp but then created a public spectacle about ranbir cheating on her! What a hypocrite!
And I think it should be Deepika Padukone, wife of Ranveer Singh. Period. Not Deepika Padukone Singh, not Ranveer Singh Padukone. <br>I don&#39;t know why, I used to be a huge fan of Deepika... but she is somehow very suffocating..
i find deepika rude nowadays. Sara handles troll much better. Deepika is very.... i dont know... Very suffocating..
Pure shit this is ..
I love the way she talks deepika padukone wife of ranveer singh padukone.Omg she is sooo cute.
I always loved her and her voice 💞😍 And I think she should thank god that Ranbir kapoor didn&#39;t value her that time😆
i love deepika padukone not sing.
that dhin chakka dhoom accent
K
That interviewer is so annoying...
i think she doesnt have much of sense of humor she has very poor tolerance levels for a celebrity .. she is the contrast example of ranveer whoz full of life, witty and good at giving replies..
Deepveer❤️
He sounds like gay  ?? Is he  ??  no offense  Just For Information  !
God bless u
She is such a dominating wife ... And kudos to ranveer to be submissive
She is always my favourite n I love her so much coz she is very down to earth
the ist time he met ranveer  see she said he was someone committed and he flirted me i love it fuck man i dont need that type of person
Cringe interviewer

Kitna chutiyaa..h yeh interview lene wala.......bhakkk bsdk...chutiyaa....
She has gone thru depression before.<br>She is v emotional.
I love dipika and ranveer ..
I knew that ke yeh jodi Bhansali ke wajeh se bani 😂😂
1.03 she is wearing a mangalsutra... So cute of her.. She&#39;s damn lucky... Best couple I&#39;ve seen..
Luv u Deepika 😘 I
Am i the only one who doesnt find Deepika beautiful?
The anchor reminds me of my 5 year old brother. Really cute ................
He said in the award show..infact thanked her for keeping him grounded all these years...they are the best couple..
Ohk why is she not wearing sindur(just asking)...i love u a lot deepika from kolkata 😘😘
They removed the part where Deepika said &#39;&#39;Ranbir cheated on her with Katrine while she was dating him&#39;&#39; in this interview
She felt he was special for the first time when he flirted with her while he was dating someone else
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=60">1:00</a>  it was sadeeal. (surreal).  Got it.    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23byn">#Byn</a>
For a moment, I thought this was maria abramovic&#39;s performance art video with &#39;Ulay oh&#39; in the background.
&quot;kya kyun lagta h aise iss aadmi ko&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love deepika outfit
That anchor becomes Karan Johar type suddenly..
Irritating Anchor.
What is this accent. My innocent ears
I wonder how hard is to laugh without any reason infront of the camera and a bunch of people who is just concerned about the camera angle to be perfect
Very Nice <br>Thanks Filmfare for this nice video
I am love deepika very much ❤❤
Cute Jodi
I just wanna say that I am Dil Se very happy for Deepika to be blessed with someone like Ranveer Singh as her husband/life-partner.<br>Because I can relate how she went through so much low time &amp; even depression because of whatever reason including break-up from that asshole Ranbir kapoor.. who is indeed a bastard...a player; who does not respect the value of true relationship. <br>She loved ranbir madly but that scoundrel could not see that and lost a precious germ like Deepika. <br>Nwy, jo bhi hota hai eventually best ke liye hi hota hai; she is now the loving wife of the wonderful Ranveer Singh who is 1000 times better than anyone else. God bless the couple with great love, happiness and success.
The interviewer can’t interview
Reply to trollers😂
Sorry. Per ya chutiya hai kon..
ayushman said kyu lgta h aesa is admi ko hahaha best part

Es ladki mai aesi kon c beauty hai aj tak samaj ni aya.
Her eyes speaks true
Deepika is a bravely. What reply to the afrin, &quot;mai apako copy Kar rahi thi.&quot;
The interviewer should have been careful at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=151">2:31</a>, he literally said <b>RANBEER</b> instead of <b>RANVEER</b> (I replayed the part over 10 times on high volume to confirm it), especially given that now they are married as well she has had a history with Ranbir too. And come on Dude, these three are one of the biggest bollywood stars of this age. <br>He just got lucky because of Deepika&#39;s humility that she did not react a bit, let alone say something.
Kis chutiye ko bithaya h interview lene... He sounds pathetic n irritating
Should I try to copy Deepika&#39;s look in ethnic ?? Like if interested please 🥰
the host appears to be more cuter than deepika
PLEASE WATCH!!!!! YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE WHAT IT IS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnnow21YoZk">https://youtu.be/Hnnow21YoZk</a>
Meeethaaaa
Oh
Deepi u so slim
The interviewer is soo creepy
I feel she is not that beautiful,  she is overrated...
https://youtu.be/W62StCNAPJE
Did he just say Ranbir lol
She is fabulous amazing simple unlike other diplomatic actresses... Love u so much Deepika... n may god bless  the couple.. stay together forever ❤️
Nakli karan johar
Just posting my humble opinion... she&#39;s nice,soft spoken,has a vibrant personality and so and so...But I feel, she could have reacted to the trolls little more positively......Or at least she shouldn&#39;t have said &quot;mere pas bohot paise hai&quot;....<br>Coz, on a serious note, she belongs to a country where millions are starving...Hence, I think she should have replied more sensibly and softly... 😊😊 We can&#39;t tolerate prosperity of few and poverty of massess....
Someone can translate the fan&#39;s tweets part i don&#39;t speak indian please
😍😍😍😍😍

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=298">4:58</a> ek no. Ka tharki
The anchor is hijra or boy or girl
Deepika padukone wife of ranbir singh padukone is beautiful
i&#39;m so happy she looks good and she is speaking out of her mined i like how she is speaking freely about her relationship  bcs she used to be so mute about it and the fact she is confortable that&#39;s really makes me happy and if a man can make this change in her attitude   then it&#39;s worth marrying him love her
Hay why saying he BHARO MY MAANG , what ever you saying , first I would ant you Indian your not Indian , don&#39;t make fun of your own culture
ye mota bhosri ka itna khush kyo ho raha hai. ranvir ne isko khub choda hai, ye chotia sirf tharki pan hi kar sakta hai.
Where  is Ranveer&#39;s interview??😡😡.. And why did the channel delete the part that was shown from it????
Lol what a fat lump
Why is he touching her
She is too gorgious in red ❤❤❤
I love her 😘
Anchor =Karan Johar 😎😎
Tum to  history hi badl diya
.
She is very arrogant and have no dignity to reply to the trolls
Damn her accent is so so bad in English .. I wanna to mute her
Flood of make up on dusky skin
What on earth did I just watch? He is a terrible interviewer.
And if naveen is an income tax officer then???  Deepu 😁😂😂😂😂

Deepika u r so beautiful
Kalwuyi deepika😈
But they had been dating since years!!<br> When she said &quot;now we wake up with each other.. or share our space&quot;<br> WTF? as if they didn&#39;t do all that before!
girl as u are an actress we expect a mere foundation matching your colour not two to three shades lighter than your real colour. from the time of om shanti om or take that song &quot;love mera hit&quot; that was your skin tone!!! now nobody can say that with age the colour gets fairer.. ofcourse not!!!!.... but a bit difference in neck and face is visible on camera and thanks to high definition that  your minute mistakes can be pointed out. but please dont pretend to be fairer than you are. be happyy with what you have got and yeah match your foundation please. no harsh feelings just a feedback. unfortunately it won&#39;t reach u though
Nice
O god this anchor needs to get over the kjo mode
Omg deepi love u so much when u answered  mai apko copy kar rahi thi ... u killed it  love
I think katrina is more beautiful than her
Deepika&#39;s answers to the trollers were epiiiiiic!
i wish her and her Husband all the best .i hope u will always together
how she speaking englisch <br>my god she is beautiful talented whatever ,but her english kya hua
इनका बच्चा जब शादी करेगा तो क्या सरनेम बनेगा फिर😂 पादुकोण+सींग+बच्चेकी वाइफ का सरनेम 🤣 और आगे बढ़ते जाएगा😂
Deepveer the best <a href="http://couple.in/">couple.in</a> the world....after my mum dad😉
Most sweetest n friendliest interviewer ever.
Why people are spending their lot of time on them or koi kaam dhanda ni ha?
The most funny part is tht deepika believed tht ranveer was flirting with her and when ranveer was interviewed he said he was not filrting with deepika he was just talking with her in a  friendly way , so this shows that deepika was into ranveer when ranveer was not into her tht time
Love u deep❤️💗💗
All I saw is her smile glow on cheeks and that cute mangalsutra omg she carries it so elegantly touchwood
The only time deepika ever sounded interesting
Who is this joker 😜😝
Love u deepika
Me aap ko copy kr rhi thi 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅

Deepika Padukone, wife of Ranveer Singh Padukone. Superb💪
If u are that rich why don’t u do something for the poor no one even gonna notice u otherwise whatever u r because of the audience and try to boast about your richness.I use to be her fan but I don’t like her at all such an arrogant person she behaves after marriage.<br><br>The person who hadn’t seen money in their life and suddenly become rich they behave like you guys.
love you

Deepika💋💋💋
Ranveer Singh Padukone is an epic thing! She is a real queen!!
Her &quot;Chiiiii&quot; is so cute
The presenter is the male version of Saroj Khan...no?
Is he a girl?   I mean anker 😄😄😄

The interviewer seems kind hearted but his voice and the way he speaks makes me uncomfortable....but it&#39;s okay. I really don&#39;t want to offend.
Ye anchor chhakka lag rha hai
Mujhe full show dekhna hay kaisa dekhun
Luv your and
day by day she is becoming more beautiful
deepu is like heaven queen
Happy married life
Deepika Padukone is Ranveer&#39;s wife and Ranveer singh is Deepika&#39;s Husband❣
She is so cuteer
Too much cheesy accent
She sucks! look at her talking abt rabir kapoor n she is all giggly &amp; when it comes to ranveer singh, she gets stuck up n no starry eyes. Pity for Mr Singh
I love dipika divos i
I love you  dipo
She is sooo bad
Bharo my maang😆😆😆
😘😘😘😘😘
She didnt gave nice answers
Deepika nay
She was looking so damn gorgeous Ma Shaa Allah
the host English needs improvement
Could he BE more gay?
Why is he so gay?
What is she talking.. I hate the away she talks and her interviews
Happy new year
Depika is gorgeous.
So natural... Unlike other actresses who just got married!
Aishwarya Rai look
The best couple ever DeepVeer 😍😍😍😍😘
Jiteesh Pillai Or whatever his name is..Is a CREEP. The tone of questioning is horrible. She is an amazing actress asking such intimate questions is yuck. Unke films ke baare me toh pucho. I mean this is filmfare right...Her fans wants to know about her future projects ask about that too. Gossiping like a bridesmaid. Especially that last preview of interviewing Ayushman Khurana...He asked him if he cheated on his wife...which Ayushman gave witty answer to and then Pillai says I don&#39;t believe it! How rude! Are you supposed to insult and offend a guest on the show? I like Deepika but i am going to press dislike only because of the interviewer.
Her sweater makes me itch and the interviewers voice makes me cringe. Piece of crap stuck in her tooth? That explains the lies she tells abt plastic surgery.

Chodu ancor
Interviewed by a potato. Question on tabs on kissing and her answer was we went back 50 years. No! If our society&#39;s &#39;advanced&#39; by allowing our spouses to kiss others in the name of art. Unfortunate.
What&#39;s the interviewer&#39;s name?
Love you deepu
Deepika your ranbir ka jore hit ha
Deepika has become...more arrogant?

Doesn&#39;t hv dressing sense at all.
Who is this host? Yuk
That look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=262">4:22</a> tho...😁...meme enthusiast!😜😂😅
Who is this Amul baby anchor
why is this host so annoying?
Is she mad?? What did she say deepika padukone wife of ranveer singh padukone???😡😡
She wanted fun and adventure and Ranveer is the most frank and the person who is enjoying his life the most in the whole bollywood industry
Samjh main nhi aata....In dono ki shaadi shaadi thi ya navratri....9 Din chalti rhi😂😂
Such annoying! Both the host and the guest!
Enjoyed this videos, Thx for uploading

Ohhh... those dark circles... 😎😍
mangalsutra 😍 kisi ne notice kia....???
This interviewers laugh is soo fake man!
The replies to trolls were so lame

DEEPU Bangara
How are these people talk show hosts again? Wtf.
His voice is horrible lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=113">1:53</a>
👎👎👎👎
The 3rd aswer she gave to the people who troll her was mind blowing ... I just love deepika
You are simply irresistible.
I love her.. she&#39;s happy n composed now
beautiful lag rahi hai Deepika nice look love you
where to watch full episode?
Deepika is the best..
wait a second! he was flirting with her while dating someone else and deepika says thats when she knew he was special? deepika are you mentally stable? you have been cheated on and here you are saying someone else on verge of cheating on their GF is special to you? gosh all these bollywood people are messed up in their head. only thing that is imp to them is money - as proven by ambani&#39;s reception.
Nice Small Chat...really like it!
Actress like deepika priyanka are really faking themselves to show them as pale skin tone....then what is the point of deepika starting till foundation and priyankas bumble app?
The host is so irritating!!! Looks like he s straight out from the kindergarten to the talk show
kya chutiya story
kya chytiya story .
Grand salute to both of ur accent gosh
Hahahaha nice chat love you Deepika padukone nd also ranveer Singh.padukone
so sweet deepu
Love is blind?  A guy is flatting with you when he is in a relationship and yet you fall in love with him???
Don’t show this fucking attitude to fans 🖕🏾 Because of fans your wat your today ,  fuck with ur reception have some respect towards fans bitch , this is one reason I hate Bollywood they can’t respect their fans come and learn from south industry
Which Lipstick?
I loved her lipstick. which is she wearing?
is this anchor .....he or she??? voice ...sound like she ..<br>looks little bit like he😁😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=163">2:43</a> I think she&#39;s talking bout ifa awards 😊😊😊i remember that ranveer was so romantic nd deepu was wearing a very beautiful saree😘😘😘i love this couple
Nobody mentions the people who are responsible for making these couples actually !<br>In Anushka - Virat case, it was the ad filmmaker who casted them in that shampoo ad....the couple should be thankful to that ad filmmaker who brought them together ..<br>Mr. Bhansali is responsible for two high profile relationships.. Salman - Aishwarya and Ranveer - Deepika ! He was the one who brought them close by casting them together for the first time...<br>Saif - Kareena should be thankful to Mr. Vijay Krishna Acharya for casting them in the disaster called Tashan !
I love u deepu u r too sweet
😍🤗😚😙😗😘🌸💫🎀❤️😻🖤
I love deppooo from 🇵🇰
Bharo my mangh 😂😂😂lysmmmm💖💖💖 deepika padukone wife of ranveer singh padukone

She looks like ayshvireya rai
Perfect Indian Beauty and a complete actress

Overacting

<b>Anchor is a second version of karan johar</b> 😂😂

She&#39;s blushing while telling about her sindoor story
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6L-SVwrdk">https://youtu.be/9V6L-SVwrdk</a>
The host gives competition to KJo
Deepika love always u are my favorite
Omg this host <br>The way he speak <br>If you know what I mean 😆
What .....
Ranveer Singh Padukone is so good and right. we why women should damn  change their name
He was idiot
Can&#39;t wait for the interview with AISHWARYA ❤❤❤
Ranveer Singh Padukone😂😂😂
You are a complete woman.....😍
And Deepika..Ranveer is happy being Ranveer Singh Bhavnani..you can keep Padukone to your self.<br><br>Also, feminism doesn&#39;t mean that you can say anything without getting other person&#39;s consent.<br>If it would have been other way around..i.e. If Ranveer would have said that he is Ranveer Singh..Husband of Deepika Padukone Bhavnani..then I&#39;m sure &quot;woke&quot; feminists would surely have gotten a problem with that..!<br><br>Bottom line is..she shouldn&#39;t have disrespected him in the name of &#39;feminism&#39; .Talk about equal rights..and by going with that..it definitely requires consent before giving such statement.
Why hasn&#39;t Deepika removed her Rk tattoo yet..!? Isn&#39;t it weird to keep it for no reason..? She has moved on..got married..ppl know she&#39;s been strong enough to do that..to keep her past behind..but what&#39;s the thing with the tattoo!? <br>I know RS doesn&#39;t care about it or is bothered about it..as he never asked her to remove it in the last 6+ years..but what I know is..if she removes it..it would definitely be appreciated by everyone &amp; It would be respectful to RS too.
In my head maybe. He is really honest 😂😂
He was flirting with her while he was dating someone else! That says a lot about his character, and hers.
He had to bharo my maang??? Like seriously wtf. 11yrs in the industry and she still can’t string a sentence in Hindi.
Flirting n the crab thing was the best ...hahaha 😂😂👍❤
The interviewer voice is so irritating
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S50DZwhjaKA&amp;t=292">4:52</a> me apko copy kar Rahi thi🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ranveer more than a hubby he is hers best friend 😘😘the thing which all girls want..!! Both are so lucky to get one another 😍❤️

I just don’t understand even in this era Bollywood actresses are trying to get fair with the procedures😭she look so fair as compared to what she was before, she had very dusky complexion.  It’s very sad that they still think that being white is beautiful😂😳
Hindi bolana chahiye

God! This interviewer sucks big time
Is he a brother of KJO?😁😁😁😁
Deepika ur eyes are so mesmerizing.....
Asshole anchor host sounds girlish
This interviewer dude is hella annoying
Is she pregnant already? 😅This oversized red colored clothes don&#39;t suit her.. 😴she has opened up a lot now, but sometimes, her mind still is blank. But she is emotional and true to herself. 😊
Host is d most annoying one
Uski smile yaar 😍😍😊Maar dala...
Deepika u r so beautiful...😚😚
Kya yaar shadi to sab karte hai ...  Deepika just shaafi ki hai koi invention nai kiya ki har baar shadi ko elabarate karke ..  batao shaadi isi hui visi hui ..
Very nice deepika
Who was he(ranveer dating , while he was flirting with deepika??
Depika n ranver r best couple in bollywood
Anchor is very annoying 😬😬
I love youuuuuuu😍😍😍😍😚😚😚❤❤❤❤❤
Shws become mor happy
Karan johar ka sasta version
It should be titled.........after wedding not after marriage
Ye interviewer gents hai ki ladies....
She showed who wears the pants in the house. Power to you, girl. LOL
I love her dressing sense 😍😍😍😘😘😘
This Was Cute!❤️❤️
गोल्या
Nice sweter...💕💕❤
Sanjay leela Bhansali = ranveer+ Deepika<br>Ayan Mukerji = ranbir + alia
Great. Love from <a href="http://mperfumeshop.com/">mperfumeshop.com</a>
I hate the thumbnail ... He has no right to hold deepika&#39;s hands..<br>Creep....
Bride of the year?😎
just awesome😊😍
My forever lady crush
Ranveer is the best husband. He always praises Deepika. But I don&#39;t see Deepika praising him as much. As she said I do think he is a little tinee tiny bit sacred of her. Hope he doesnt become a hen pecked husband. Both husband and wife should prasie each other. Shouldnt be just one sided.
I enjoy Deepveer every moment
God bless them
OMG I love her <br>She is the most beautiful girl
Deepu looks so beutiful
Are bhai hindi main baat kiya karo yaar pura desh hindi janata hai<br>Ye show indian ke liye hai ya angrejo ke liye
breast hi nhi hai iske ,,jokero ka interview ho raha hai,,

Indian accent is the worst accent ever I don&#39;t know why they speak English
dipi ranveer ar super stars and lovely people
ദീപു ചക്കര ഉമ്മമ്മമ്മ.മുത്താണ്
I like them on screen. But I do not understand why these two(Ran deep) act like Royals? their interviews tells us that they are not very intelligent and possess huge amount of attitude. They want to show that they define Funk or what is supposed to be funny..clearly Deepika you do not have the Element and by forcing it yourself to desperately show you are a funny person is little painful for some audience... work on your responses.. Cheeeeeeee no kiss policy? what kind of response is that? Also work on your Voice it really sounds like a whinny little girl.. the Interviewer is so GAY sorry if he really is if he is i apologize.i am sensing it by the way he is asking questions, why can&#39;t we have better stars doing great Interviews on that note Sara Ali Khan &lt;3 is wonderful and hopefully can be the next big thing, she is a true Royal by birth and is humble. She must Rule this Bollywood or India Hindi Film industry, she&#39;s got it. also Ranveer needs to show he&#39;s a married guy a bit, just a bit thou, &#39;cause he is so crazy about Sara Ali Khan from the last Interviews of Simbha those were fun.
I love deepikaaaaaa she is so beautiful <br>Mashallah
Wt about malya babe?

Ranveer Singh padukone ...this is equality
Filmfare hota hai feb mein.. she s just doing her part for that black lady 2018😂
Why are they using Simply nailogical intro music🙄

Another lady like man(Karan Johar copy)😠😠😠😠
tis want dnt knw how to speak at all .sense of humour zero .no education
The anchor is so feminine in his own way
I really like her sweater ,were we can get one.
The way this man speaks is so fuckin irritating..!!
That lip color ❤️
Most overrated &quot;actress&quot; ever. Always overshadowed, terrible dialogue delivery and is aging quite poorly. She also looks ten shades lighter now.
Wow you feel proud and special  when he flirted with you while in another relationship ? Do you even realize you are showing the actual side of what you are with that statment and I Have it all laugh and giggles. Why pull others down when you seem to have done the same with another girl.???  What if katrina showed off her achievement of having flirted by Ranbir, when  he ditched you for her. Well thank God at least she didn&#39;t continue to be famous in the industry by advertising depression .  So fake and a attention seeker deepika and it has not changed since years.
Wow she looks damned gorgeous 😍😍😍
This was... well, not everyone can interview like Karan Johar.
RanDeep

Burrow my maang😂😂😂♥️♥️
Excellent replie of those peoples who always try to tease other
