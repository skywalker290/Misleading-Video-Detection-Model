Nawazuddin Siddiqui is world&#39;s best actor 🙏🙏
Nawaz bhai your good
Alia Bhatt ki jagah aise star ki movie dekhiye jo really talented hai
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ECUF2RlMs&amp;t=132">2:12</a> <b>Vasudha wearing red dress in shot killed Raghuveer Singh</b>
Both are fine actors,
The most talented actor <br>Much better than budda’s - shahrukh khan, salman khan, amir khan(nepotism)<br>Its time to bycott all budhaa’ssss🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Nawaz sir n radhika just mind blowing
Classic voice and acting: nawajuddin siddhiqi<br>Best facial expression and deep acting : pankaj tripathi<br>Best acting and comedy : manoj bajpeyi<br>This three valuable stone of industry who deserve oscar
Good actor, lucky he got chance to prove himself... there are huge talent pool, who will prove far better if they will get their dues honestly.

i hope you guys would be able to find more actors like Nawaz....
Mene filmifilla se download kr ke dekh liye 🥰
I have seen the movie. It is a great movie.<br>Every characters have done great job<br>Specially nawaz and radhika.<br>I will recommend to watch this💖
Sab lok thoda jada emotional ho gaye hain <br>Nawaz sir : haan...dekh raha huu 😂😂😂😂
I don&#39;t get it  . Does Nawazuddin selects good scripts or the script becomes better after Nawazuddin enters....????
Are bhai pura movie hi upload kar do na sahi rahega
Probably one of the best thrillers
Yadav जटिल है
Great movie loved it!! I have already watched it twice!!! Nawazuddin was great!! These dumb nepotism kids couldn’t do 1 second of his acting!!!! The sheer talent in his acting was phenomenal!!!!!
Muzhe ye pura dekhana hai kaha milenga
Great movie👍real talent ❤💕👌✌
Sab log jyada emotional horaha hai...<br>Nawaz: hah2 dekh raha hai😂😂😭😭😭
Great movie! Saw it yesterday. Remarkable performances! Superlative execution of the story.  I have pledged to appreciate good movies, especially by outsiders. Don&#39;t want any more Sushant like situation.i regret his loss.

I love the way he talks
I didn&#39;t understand one thing. When the girl killed him... The light was there... But vikram had called him just after the light was gone. How did Raghu beer talk to him? then?
Amazing Nawaz
Movie was gud, however I felt that songs at the end were totally unnecessary. Movie length could be shortened by 20min. Suspense was revealed just like that in one go, in a very ordinary way. Apart from these things, Everything was perfect.

Gail nhi h movie main ☹️
Sath mai sardar khan ka assistant hai😁😁😁.
बहुत बकवास और बोरिंग फिल्म ।
Best suspense thriller of 2020🔥🔥🔥 nawazuddin sir delivered Oscar winning performance 👌👌👌
He Natrual actor and awesome one .
नवाज़ु दी न.. The real Talent
Unpopular opinion but what a crap movie only thing good about it is the acting of two lead actors.
Whenever Nawaz plays Gangster or the opposite Police....Any movie or series is a must watch....At least for him
Story:<br>A girl kill her uncle as he had abused her when she was a minor. <br>Pathetic 2hrs+ shitty film.<br>Don&#39;t watch it.<br>Nothing new.
must watch ...i didn’t cook, clean or do anything ...just sat and watched in my bedroom ...fantastic ...also loved that Nawazuddin sir took on a different police persona than the one he exhibited in Kahaani. he is a clever actor. radhika was a vision ...just incredible to watch her portray a range of emotions and expressions.
Fantastic movie....
I&#39;ve done it ,well Intersting End
Yadav ji
It&#39;s an intriguing movie. Radhika and Nawazuddin are best but I would like to appreciate ila Arun and Tigmanshu for their fabulous performance. Each and every cast member has nailed it with their acting.
Just watched this... it&#39;s a below average movie. Investigation of the crime is really pathetic. Climax was okay.
Just watched it. Not an interesting movie.below average.good acting with faltu story.
Great...achha  banaya achhi story....aur baki nawaz to hai hi .....must watch
FIRST TIME proud of the audience ab Maja ayega we have to boycott every starkid movie annanya Sara jhanvi everyone and don&#39;t worry about the outsiders involved in the movie if audience dekhegi nai movie toh outsiders k sath outsiders ko hi lenge <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice">#justice</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23proudindia">#proudindia</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23youth">#youth</a>
Fucking beauty!!<br>Hopefully people will now start watching the better films..
Amazing script all credit goes to writer and director ..<br>Nawauddin Sadiqui is really amzing as always he is legend no one can beat his acting skills😍
Background music in this movie was too loud. It was difficult to hear the dialogue.
I dint find this movie gripping and edge of the seat mystery. I&#39;ve finished watching it in three days time.
Netflix can do an entire series on Inspector Jatil Yadav. People will love it!!
Copy of knives out.
I saw twice, its a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Is muvy ko dekhne k liye, koi review dekhne ki zrrt nhi pdegi ...
Lack of direction<br>The man in front of nawaz on Stairs is showing high status than nawaz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ECUF2RlMs&amp;t=116">01:56</a>
18+ seen to nhi h na ?<br><br>Family ke sath dekhe skte h ?
Seems it is worth.. watching

Loved this film ♥️
Super Hero
Loved the movie!
The ambience of the movie is superb. Casting and acting of each cast is perfect.
Aisa laga jaise Agatha Cristi ka novel padh rhe hai.
Isn&#39;t this a copy of Knives Out?
Simple si kahani hai ... Wahi &quot; Child Abuse and Tharak pan.... Jatin ka naam , unki amma ne Jatil likh diya tha form me..🤓🤪
Look like knives out
Seems like copy of Knives Out.
People showing off after watching the movie downloaded from telegram
Just nailed it
This is actually worst movie of Nawaz Siddiqui&#39;s entire career. Worst movie of 2020. Every talented actor got Wasted in this movie. Climax is so pathetic. <br>I don&#39;t understand those people mentality Who thinks this is great job. Are You guys dumb?? Not every dark movie is good. If you want to see Dark suspense thriller, go and watch Manorama 6 feet under, Kahaani, Talaash again

Worst
I came to see radhika apte nd shweta tripathi😣
Brilliant Neo-Noir Movie. A big fan of this genre. Interesting that Netflix India has put up this small segment, as one can figure out the murderer by looking closely at the expressions of the performer who is playing that role. I would advise everyone to try it out once they&#39;ve seen the movie. Nevertheless, the explanation was top notch and very difficult to figure out. Keep making such awesome movies :)
Ye radhika apte marwane wale seen kyon karti hai
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ECUF2RlMs&amp;t=217">03:37</a> actual acting tallent of nawaz sir, we love you sir, sach me kabhi kabhi lagata hai aaphi iss industrie ke bhagawan hai. Hatts of to your acting sir.👏👏
Budhiya bahut karari acting kar rahi hai. Jabardast

Bhi nawas bhi original artist hai baki sab tooo fake hai
its good but copy from western movie......no police enquiry is done like this particularly in UP
I am speechless....Amazing movie...Awesome story....Superb....😊
Nawaz sir 🙏keep it up and be careful in choosing movies

Netflix is the best
The movie is very intense, tricky portion comes at the end only , you need to be very patient during watching this movie or you are going to feel bored.
By the trailor it seems interesting. Thanks Netflix India for giving us quality choices
Jatin se jatil Yadav naam banake rakh Diya aapne -maa
So many subtle messages. A very good movie. 🤗🤗🤗
Just finished watching it, awesome movie. Acting was brilliant from the whole cast and love the multilayered story of a whodunnit movie.
Knives out ka desi version lagta hai
I watched it .. I didn&#39;t find the story any new or interesting.. rest acting is as usual very good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ECUF2RlMs&amp;t=45">0:45</a> Salil Jamdar lite found😂
Who else think Ramesh chauhan&#39;s was played by Tigmanshu dhulia not this man..
Brilliant piece of art. ❤
Nawaz looks sharper than ever.his acting skills were great before.but now it is beyond the world.reminds me of amir khan.sooo eager to see this movieeee

Such a brilliant movie... No one not even one of the actors miss a beat... We have such sheer talent in our country in terms of direction and story writing... Must watch!!!
Shandar jabarjast zindabaad....... Love u nawajuddin siddiqui ......
Knives out
Just got done watching this. This film is absolutely brilliant. Every cast member is perfect and the writing is impeccable. Its not just a regular thriller, it deals with so many issues that our society regularly deals with, effectively. Nothing like Knives Out in any way (+this finished shooting before knives out released). Loved it. Keep it up Netflix. Radhika is your lucky charm.
Hey guys! I know this is a wrong place maybe but i need ur support....Really. I make some cinema based contents and post it on insta and fb....on insta @society_onscreen you can find it out.... It&#39;s Good....plzzz your support can boost me up and help me grow my content further....
This seems to be taken out of the movie &quot;Knives Out&quot;, which was a brilliant movie. Do watch that, and you can tell the striking similarity. I might be wrong, since this is just a sneak-peek!!
https://youtu.be/4A_gftAqX3s 👈 real reason 😊🌟 Link👆 🌍<br><br> NEED SUPPORT 🤝. 🙏 . 🤲 . 🤜 🤛
The question is not WHO? But WHEN he got killed.
Ye film bahut achhi hai

Smashing the walls of Patriarchy with some Indian Tadka, must watch thriller influenced post this review <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GbzoXL0aMM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GbzoXL0aMM</a>
Actor faad hai but picture bekar hai
Watched it last night.. And to be very honest.. Post the demise of one of my heroes Irrfan.. I had one thing in my mind that any one who could come closer to him is Nawaz and he proved it through this movie.. For me one of the finest performances by Nawaz.. Rest of the star cast also performed quite well.. A gripping film that is a tight slap on the face of cruel and heartless patriarchal society that is still prevalent in some parts of our country..
tamil dubb available
I left a zoom class after getting a netflix notification
