😂
Did he say &quot;nuttamai&quot; for &quot;naataamai&quot;??? 🤣 rofl<br><br>Ps. Only tamil folks can understand...
IMHO, why do you think every character in a movie has to be politically correct always? Showing a person mouthing certain dialogues, or acting in a certain way is not the film&#39;s way of saying that the film maker approves of such things! Also,  please see the content in its context. In Bulandi, the setting is of a village. That was village justice in a situation where everyone knew everyone. Also,  they were showing old time panchayat justice. <br>Would you see a movie on Black slavery in the 1800s, and call it regressive just because it is not politically correct to own slaves in this day and age? Try to understand where the characters as humans are coming from.
Why were most of these movies obsessed with rapes?? Almost every movie has some rape scene in it.
Bhai aap hmere liye ye films dkhte ho??😶 Itna mohabbat😥
Clickbait photo acha hai.. LOL
And how is anything different today?
Kk
I have to commend you for going through hours and hours of watching such movies to provide us with this amazing content 😊
Meanwhile in 2020 things have not changed.
Haven&#39;t you watched &quot;Betaaj baadshah&quot;???
Please review mehabooba, aa ab laut chale, albela, kya yehi pyar hai.. all cringe gold
D series are always great..but what I absolutely love is the narrator&#39;s voice...it&#39;s amazing!
Please speak Hindi names correctly 🌚
All the bad guys with big tilak on their head : typical Bollywood 🤮
Disagree with your views about bulandi but rest is fine. I have my reasons to disagree. The time that bulandi shows and the society, they do believe that women should eat after men; the dialogue that was said by the character played by Shakti kapoor is bad but we hear it from the antagonist. What do you expect from a villain, he&#39;ll touch her feet and thank for for giving him birth? Yes, the girls must have a choice like men and they do have, but the movie is not of the time where such ideas are idolized. In &#39;Manto&#39; Sadat Hassan Manto has mentioned that its his work to show the world what the real society is and not to manipulate things. Its a movie and they must have the liberty to present the prevailing society likewise. You can question the content and the writing part but such characters have been there and are still there. Besides, Narsimha mein ek maa ne agar yeh kaha ki uske bete ko iss haal mein pahunchane wale ki aulad ko bhi bhugatna hoga, toh how are you expecting logic with sensibility there? What do you expect, she&#39;ll bless her even after seeing her son on the death bed?
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
😂💪
Uggghhhh... I miss 2019😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rekha ne to aur bhi movies me hindu sanskar ka bhasan diya.... Sirf aurato k liye hi.... Ek aur movie h inki... Sansar naam ka usme inka dialogue rhta h ki &quot;tum ek kattar hindu ki beti ho or Christian ladke se shadi krogi log kya khenge.. Blah blah... Mtlb mai sun k shock rah gyi... 😅😕😦
Pati ne jab tak tati nahi ki ho tab tak tum bhi bathroom mat jana💕😊
Bulandi was such a masterpiece and a dark reality of some villages.. so i think it shouldn&#39;t be in this list
Wtf bollywood 😑
One the name of sanskariti you can even rape and kill somebody...what a bizzare
these stupid movies has educated the men of india ,and made our india proud with women sexual harassments on top and regressive towards women  and also transgenders too. one should spit on themselves if they cant understand what i mean.
Bro, how many crap movies you’ve seen
Ah,nice i made it into 1000 comments
&quot;Old movies were better than today&#39;s movies&quot;<br><b>The movies</b> :
I feel like rather than filmmakers society is the one to blame, after all, film is said to portray the society.
This is so funny lol😂😂😂😂😂
South Korean movies are untouchable...yes even compared to Hollywood....<br>So Bollywood is not even in the race....fuckin embarrassing
Buddy ...you and me don’t matter....this is is easily swallowed by 90% population...so get over it and move on!!
Don&#39;t you think his voice is addictive??
As far as the movie buland is concerned, rajni kaand (I hope this is how the last name is rightly spelled) he decides the girls fate because despite the girl having her own choice she still doesn&#39;t have the choice to marry some one because she is being raped and no one want to marry her. So that was a bit unfair .
Ek suggest karna tha...<br>Whenever u try to explain anything about bollywood movie plz explain in hindi. It will benefit for u for gaining subscribers.<br><br>English mat use karo
We have evolved a lot since these nonsense
Bulandi film ki scene me kya problem tha. 1980s ka zamana hai bai. us zamane me  Waisa hi hota tha. rape victim rapist se hi shaadi karna padta tha. us film ko appreciate karo kyonki Upper caste ke ladke sath Lower caste ka shaadi ho gaya tha. us ladki ko baap ne kya love marriage karva deta tha kya.
Bulandi was no doubt a good movie, I cannot agree for Bulandi, the rape scene of movie makes a poor low caste women to be married to high caste rich Shakti kapoor which was in all ways good shown for the women.... There is no fault in this, BULANDI movie shud not b put in this List
😂
Older films, be it bollywood or regional were downright regressive, sexist, misogynistic and portrayed patriarchy at it&#39;s maximum level. These movies portrayed the regressive and sexist mentality of the scriptwriters and directors back then. They also nurtured the regressive mentality of the audience back then. I finally found a  channel who is openly discussing such issues and trying to tear off the mask of hypocrisy of both the audience and the filmmakers.
Dharam paaji best dialogue: Aapki bhasha mere palle to pd nahi rahi
Bulandi, so bad script, this movie should been band
I think sometimes you over search and willingly present a wrong analysation of a matter. What was wrong with Narsimha scene.
I can&#39;t believe you watched all these movies 😅😅 for making kuch bhi vedios
Absolutely sir, in that time, Bollywood had many movies which was total crap and senseless in the name of entertainment.   But don&#39;t tell me, this age has developed and matured.    In fact, we can definitely forgive that age thinking that audience at that time had nothing else to make them aware and more mature.   But what about today, when people say or I should people think that there are more qualified, developed and aware people due to technology and social media and still Bollywood makes most of the senseless movies and today&#39;s audience still make them 100 crore box office success.  Common now don&#39;t tell me that are few.   If you compare the two eras then those era atleast had committed and creative artistes and not businessmen like today, who makes anything and everything without knowing the ABC of art.   How do you apply this logic buddy !
OMG!!! I am so glad I never watched Bollywood movies. I never knew these atrocities existed. I am blessed that my parents gave us the opportunity to watch quality stuff (Malayalam &amp; English).
Bulandi ka to faltu me ghusaya .
ye kaun si sabhyata h be
Bhai, please Hindi mein Bola Karo
Bollywood need more critics like you.👏👏👏👏
Rani Mukherji&#39;s Raja ki Aaegi Barat - classic case of victim made to marry the rapist.
don&#39;t you think due to these kind of movie we have learnt a lot and calling such things wrong today?
Narsimha and Bulandi (other than that marrying your rapist) has nothing absurd. Times were different what is considered bad now doesnt mean it was bad then and you judging by today standard is absured.
There is nothing wrong in bulandi  .mr hot man
No words 🤦🏻‍♂️
The dialogue &#39;Agr me paida nhi hota tu bhaanj kehlaati&#39; is just disgusting. I can only imagine how unthankful and disgraceful that character could be. Such a shameful act
I disagree with bulandi being in this list.
Bulandi was actually very popular n liked even though you r right about the cringe worthy scenes.
RIP hindi ...💐💐💐

Some of the scenes are really realistic,,,not eating before your husband,,,,domestic violence and many more.
Girlfriend was pretty offensive especially to the Gay and Lesbian Community.  Thank you for pointing this out.
You forgot Raja Ki Ayegi Baraat.

T&#39;CHALA: Somebody get this man a medal
You should also include &quot;Gharwali Bharwali&quot; the whole movie is itself so bizzare
Omg I died at the aam scene 😂😂😂
Girlfriend movie was seriously useless and portrayed the wrong image that if someone is lesbian or gay they have suffered from childhood abuse which is so wrong you can&#39;t change someone&#39;s sexual orientation regardless of childhood upbringing
Tmhe esi video Hollywood movies p b banani chahiye
Bulandi is A good movie ☺️
Naataamai tamil film was blockbuster film in south india
Tell us how sex became mandatory in Bollywood movies today
Jammy ji, widwa aj 2019 me bhi abshgun hoti hai. Ap ne Kabhi real widwa ashram dekha hai. Widwa se shaddi ki ritual main shamil nahin karty aj bhi. Dunya ki souch aj bhi pehly si hai. Pati se pehly khana merey pariwar neighbour hood &amp; all 50 shaddi I have attended in my 44 years of life nahin khatey. In weddings pehly men eat food after them women &amp; children. I also attend Moharam mjalis since I was little girl 1st men eat then women. Blatkar: har insan ki apni shamta hoti hai per normally blatkari se shaddi main hi larki ka bhala hota hai. Koi kal merey sath karjaye main tu Court kachehri nahin jayoun gi woh karey ga shaddi tu thek nahin tu is sheher main bohot se 50 feet se unchy bridges hain koud maroun gi. Mukhtar Mai 16 men ne is ka Pakistan me pachayat ke huqum pe samohik blatkar kiya usky pita Bhai ke samny room me leja kar. Mukhtar Mai Lahore Court apny pita sath atti case larny. Human Rights walee UN tak le gayeh us pe book bhi likhi. Par aj koi apni beti ko Mukhtar name dena passand nahin karta sary 16 blatkari azad hogayeh. Tu luta koun Mukhtar mai ke pita ka saman. Aj woh gumnami main kisi ushi village ke admi se shaddi kar Ji rahi hai sanstha chlati hai to help blatkar pirit girls. Per aj bhi Pakistan main jiyada tar girls samjhota karleti hain agar blatkari nikah ko tiyar ho jayeh. Insaf kuch nahin hota. Aurat ki kul punji izzat hoti hai smaj main maqam hota hai. Par ap nahin samjho ge. Hum tu apny bary yehi kahin ge &quot;Ab jo kiye ho data esa na kijiyo<br> agly janam mohey bitya na kijiyo&quot;. Ap ke next door 22 corror ke desh pak main daily girls samjhota karleti hain. Bas blatkari ka agar maan bhar gaya tu phir Pakistan mein bridges trains bohot hain world&#39;s largest canal system bhi hai. Agar kuch na pasand Ayah ho do tell me I&#39;ll delete my comment.

Okay, this is a little sarcastic, but here’s a thought for a topic: Rare Moments in Film where Shakti Kapoor WASN’T Cringey, Creepy or 🦇💩 Crazy
Wtf bollywood
Getting married to a girl means that you are going to take full responsibility for her .love her ,nurture her,take care of her , be there for her, support her , beautify her, internally , mentally, physically, physiologically. Making her feel the life she is . This takes enormous strength . The person who shows the disgusting act of rape doesn&#39;t really has the courage to marry in the first place .
You have the capability to bring the change

अापको हिंदी मे बोलने मे क्या दिक्कत है
I sometimes feel Bollywood totally ruined an entire generation by teaching them rape, stalking, Eve teasing, being sexist and regressive and getting away with it. No wonder today India is plagued with crimes against women.
Bulandi is Pedarayadu Telugu movie remake having Rajinikanth and Mohan Babu, which was big hit. Ofcourse many illogical movies have been blockbusters.

They also new in this field. Grow up plzz
I believe that the maker of this video has hard time understanding the difference between opinion and its artistic presentation and approach. What’s wrong with these movies is the presentation of the ideas and may or may not be the ideas themselves. <br>For example, the so called “orthodox” opinions in the movie Bulandi are somewhat representational of the philosophy of our villages. It is the presentation that is awry.<br><br>In short, it will not be called a bad movie if you simply disagree with the values showcased.<br>It is a bad movie only if the final product is not what it was supposed to be i.e. entertaining or engaging or promoting a value or displaying a case etc.
I disagree with you regarding last dialog of Shakti Kapoor. He&#39;s portrayed a very evil character and that dialog to me was very suiting and consistent to his character. I didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t find that dialog odd or inconsistent. Rather, the dialog was perfect to his character.
You are talking like an expert but the reality is that many cases of homosexuality arise out of childhood bad parenting, horrifying incidences, mental stress and many more things and is backed with evidence, and there are many accounts of people who have turned straight from homosexual, on the contrary is someone is medically effected with klinefelters, turners etc is not reversible, in a world where people are changing genders thru surgeries we need to stop this bs
this film is next level of randomness 😂😂
That 1995 movie looks like some 1982 movie. I really wish you can add subtitles to those scenes

You lost me by including Rekha&#39;s dialog from Bulandi. In total, Bulandi is a good movie. It depicts many a things that are actually happening in our country. And seriously, you trying to ridicule that Rekha said it&#39;s &quot;Hindustani Sanskar&quot; not to eat before husband! It&#39;s mark of respect in our society where you may not be compelled to do but yet you do and follow. All Indian traditions must be a joke to you! You should better stick to movies set in metropolitan. <br><br><br>About Sunny Deol demolishing palace, howsoever illogical, that movie was made in different time. That way you can include almost all movies made in that era where the protagonist was set to defy all odds and beat 50 goons at once without tiring and escape all bullets and not miss shots.<br><br><br>Grow up man. Don&#39;t just ridicule anything and everything for the sake of it. Even if things are not believable, mostly Indian Cinema in 80s-90s, that doesn&#39;t mean you ought to laugh it off in 2019. Time was different and things change and evolve with time.
Bollywood is a piece of shit
That&#39;s why I hardly use to watch hindi movies those days.. So irritating  &amp; depressing sometimes 😡 😡 Rather cartoons were more logical than these movies 😂 😂 😂 😂
Shakti Kapoor is legend

Dude, I love this channel and your thinking as well, true feminism 🤗
Arey yaar please make a video on the stupid family melodrama called Hum Aapke Hain Kaun - especially about the very last scene where a kutta decides whom to give the darned letter. Aur apni India ki public bhi maan jaati hai ki ek kutte ki wajah se film ka Happy Ending ho gaya and as result, this movie turns out to be a blockbuster hit.<br><br>Matlab kuchh bhi.
Imagine a boring bus journey and forced to watch Bulandi on top of it.. Yes, yours truly has endured such torture and survied. Indian women are strong indeed!
Did u watch all these shitty movies??

I dont know why youtubers bring those old movies to do comedy......if you wanna do this, then do this with new movies..STUPIDS
Its not nattamai, its naataamai
I&#39;m sad to say this, but I am totally offended by what you said in the first one (girlfriend). Now, I&#39;m not against anything or supporting anything, but the world that a film-maker conceives is his own. The characters move about logically in it. What happens at any given time is lead to happen by what happened before, and you can&#39;t accuse the creator of molding the events to reinforce certain beliefs. He might have done it consciously, but you are in no place to say that. Many people think movies and books control the characters and the world they live in to get to certain goals, but intelligent creativity doesn&#39;t work that way. You create a world of your own and put certain characters into it, and observe what they do and how they behave and portray it in the movie or your book.<br>By saying something like this you&#39;re reinforcing a belief that is very harmful.<br>I hope people get what I&#39;m trying to say because this is an important thing and Bollywood can&#39;t make real movies without fully understanding it.
Childhood scars and sexual abuse can cause a shoft in sexual preference. It is not impossible.
I&#39;ve been thinking for the past week about a top ten list of Friendship based songs. Obviously Yeh Dosti from Sholay tops the list. Title tracks from Dosti and Dostana (older version) as well as the classic Teri Dosti Mera Pyar also would feature, but one song that I am surprised that has stuck in my head even after so many years is Dosti Dosti Teri Meri Dosti from the Sholay spoof film Ramgadh Ke Sholay. (It&#39;s actually so good it&#39;s in my top 3 with Dostana title track and Yeh Dosti.)
Eating after the husband is not untrue. It happens still.
Bollywood is nonsense
Raaz.. Was also illogical. Dino was cheating both the female characters but unfortunately mentally challenged girl was portraited as villan. I wonder why no body points it out.

I disagree with what u said about bulandi. Wives actually dnt eat before their husbands, its common in India. And thats what it is shown in the movie.
Useless video
Abhi kaunsi acchi movies ban rahi hai.. thugs, race3, zero, sanju 😂
I think this guy z also a fake feminist promoter
Yar bulandi was about different era and mindset. And at that time it was simultaneously existing along with modern India. Isiliye pati k bad khana ya shadi krna. It was not a bad film.

Some of the dialogues from Bulandi are taken out of context. Its not fair. Shakti Kapoor in Bulandi is portrayed as maybe one of the worst characters in hindi cinema.

Bullshit...... You are comparing apples and oranges. And forget about the time zone and logic, they at least had original content. They were not ripping off a tollywood movie to just make it in hindi. You will never ask justification for a projectile bullet but need a clarification on random dialogue. ( I never thought I&#39;ll be defending Bollywood)😑
Analysing Bollywood&#39;s impact on society is just like asking what came first, the chicken or the egg?
.
Movies are reflection of society, Bulandi showed what was happening in india.
You have a fantabulous voice mate

Hindi movies me hindi me bol raha hai chutiye
I was waiting when these guys will make something on  Bulandi ... <br>Please make  something on Sooryavansham as well
We were and we are regressive.....Why blame them...People were going to theatre to watch this shit.....Still people are going.........
We were and we are regressive
The sexism is real 😂
@Jammypants4 what’s your point in making this vid, Pyjamachhap? It’s like the work of a slacker. Some effort, puhleeze!!!! 😕
Bollywood movies copied from tamil movies
The movie bulandi.. i was watching it with my mom one aftrnoon n i said wat kind of weird stuff is going on... only raveena is practical here.. n she told me she is protraying a wrong lady who does not values customs..!! N i was like what!!🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Just shut up man..There are so many people doing hardwork behind a movie and you are making video for fun or money with illogical sense<br>Just stop this nonsense
I sometimes wonder what actresses like Sonam Kapoor &amp; Shradda Kapoor think of their father’s roles in such awful films.
Most films mentioned here are duds! Cheap low budget made with no focus on the art of script writing or film making. They don&#39;t actually represent the best movies of 90-2000s. Fact is movies of 90s mirrored the real world ( exploitation and abuse are  still rampant) ande way better than the nonsensical high budget stuff which now hit the screen ( thugs, race, zero, Dhoom etc which are examples of pure fantasy). It seems the makers of this vid have not witnessed how  Indian society is especially in the villages . Forget matching it to the 90s
Video idea:  subtitle movie dialogues in English
I remember a scene from mithun&#39;s movie but forgot the name of the movie.<br>The scene goes like this: a politician goes up on stage to give a speech and because mithun will try to kill him he has a box made from bullet proof glass to protect him.<br>When he is inside the box mithun call him and tells him that his box is bullet proof but is it pathar proof? Then a few people throw rocks and the bullet proof box shatters.<br><br>Do you know that movie?
Bulandi was a great movie yes some dialogues seems to be cringed now but for that time movie was ahead of its age, still can watch Bulandi any day given
Chamatkar was the first film of Urmila... am I right??

Didn&#39;t like your ghatiya video
Unlogical bollywood specially from 80’s and 90’s
Can you make a Video about SHOLAY Flaws... One I know is simple.. &quot; Jab village main electricity nahi thee to Pani ki tanki jahan Dhermandra khara tha &quot; mausii say shaadi kee yes ke leyay- Us tanki main pani kon daalta tha or kaisay &quot; :)
I wS here for thumbnail related stuff
Tu kya angrej ki aulad hai. Sach bata? Kyonki aadhe se jada jo points tu uthata hai vo movie making me talent ki kami nahi balki Indian culture se jude hote hain. Vidhwa ka chehara nahi dekhana is culture ka ek superstition raha hai isme surprise kya hai? Tu khali talent ki kami ke baare me tippani kar culture hum bhartiyo pe chhod de. Samajhe milawati angrej.
Bro please make some clips of Manoj Kumar movies,they are full of melodrama and overacting. The irony of his movie Clerk is that you will be laughing by watching sad scenes.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A commendable stance against these stupid abusive thought process.
Filmen hindi men dikha raha h aur bol english men raha h
Bulandshahr was good
Bhai pls &#39;Lucia&#39; movie review kijiye. Best psychological thriller in the Indian film industry. Keeps you thinking for HOURS.
I regret to inform you that these absurd moments from bulandi are still being practiced in rural or sub- rural India.... So the film showed the relevant content according to the time.
U also dint notice how industrialist , builder , business tycoon , rich guy used to be shown as &quot;villain&quot; in almost every Bollywood movie !<br>It sets our Indian mentality that rich people are the bad guys !
I liked the last one...I never noticed these silly to things in movie before...we just watch in flow.. keeping our brain aside 🙁
Bulandi should not be on this list. At that time, those were the reality of many rural areas. Rape victims were forced to marry the rapist. Even now people &amp; panchayats follow these things and the movie is just showcasing the truth.
Bhut hi ghatiya video thi bhai...<br>Try to increase your level.
Aaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaha.... Agar Main Na Peida Hotta Tau Tu Baanjh Hi Rehti -/ Yahan Bantta Hai (Matlab Kuch Bhi) Hahahahahahaha...
Bhai ek suggestion hai may be mai shi hu ya nahi bt agr tm apni videos hindi mein bola karo toh mere khyal se zyda log connect kr pynge videos se tmare.
so many times I&#39;ve told you to do some review on Hollywood
Urdu mein bole
Ass hole Narsimha is great movie
D way d car fall from d cliff and got crashed, could have easily broken her neck. But bollywood is full of illogical miracles.
Bulandi is a nice movie
Next to this list is ZERO movie
Important question is.  Are we doing anything in 2019 that we will be mocking n regretting about in 2030?
Bollywood especially during the 80s and early 90s had some of the most regressive and unwatchable movies of all times.  Comparably 60s movies seemed more intelligent and open minded.
No one wants the commentary.
Please review Maharaja movie!
How many movies do you watch everyday???
I must say this time it&#39;s a bullshit review at all. Most of successful movie in the reviews at its time. These all movies &amp; their concepts are well accepted by audience at that time. If u not like it in today&#39;s time it&#39;s not their fault. And be ready, after 30 ~ 40 years then generation will making a fun of movies u enjoying &amp; appreciating now a days.
I feel sorry for you as you have to watch all these movies..
God! never watched Girlfriend, but it could have been made with so much grace and more emotionally filling content if people understood homosexuality. Its more of the era issue for some movies like bulandhi and girlfriend where people thought its the reality of our country so we can showcase it. They embraced the wrong side of culture which could have instead been contradicted and could have contributed towards the progress of our society. Very cool work. I always enjoy your videos! good job! :)
Please make a list of top 10/8/6/5 performances of more stars.....like those of 60s &amp; present so that we can avoid shits &amp; watch some <b>content</b>
Reality TV shows - Matlab Kuch bhi episode 😂
Aam se allergy wtf😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=134">2:14</a>
Can your wife  eat before you...? Or can your mother eat before your father ? amazing .!!! There is not such an undiscplinery thing in our society still in 2019.
Fuck Bollywood
Fuck ur content
Boring
boss watch bulandi movie again it is the girls choice to marry shakti kapoor and not rajnikants decision
Chupp be
C&#39;mon man this is Bollywood.Everything is possible.
New Playlist created
Movie ka description dekh ke pdhte ho kya 🤔
Hey Anmol, you are a very good man. Your videos give a very nice message to the youth. So I request you to make your next video on the cheap South Indian movies which objectify female stomach. Make it soon🙏
Starts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=60">1:00</a>
Please make a video on, <br>What things break when hero villain fights like matkas, car glass, tables , watermelons etc
Loved your contact. And all Matlab kuch toh bhi are awesome.
Punishing rape victims instead of the rapists, forcing rapists and rape victims to marry each other is still reality in India and our neighbouring countries. And Rekha&#39;s dialogue in Bulandi is not bizarre at all. In non-metros, small towns and villages across India, women still do not either eat alone or even do not eat until their husbands have finished eating.<br><br>This is reality in 2019.
sir, aap voice our agar hindi mein Karein toh hum logon ke liye samajhna aasaan hoga.
I like the way you say &quot;MATLAB KUCH BHI&quot;
i can understand the &quot;kuch bhi&quot; you are trying to show. and yes these logic depicted in these movies are utter bullshit. but you need to consider the human mentality of the people in 90&#39;s. i think you are a millennial. but in those days people were not thinking in the way we do today. we can see even today many people including leaders and celebrities saying, doing things that shows they are still stuck in 80-90. i am from south india. if you see south indian movies even the latest release most are still following these &quot;Kush bhi&quot; logics even today..<br><br>finally i am not saying you were wrong or anything. but you need to consider that people&#39;s way of thinking differ from each other
Does this channel advertise rape? Are you really obsessed with rape? Every second video on this channel has sexual undertones and it&#39;s really cringeworthy. Not to mention, the gayish accent of the narrator. So creepy.
Dude you are no less than a Messiah, you save us all from these Idiotic films..
Video Idea- Comparatively  good Sci Fi  from Bollywood
Haha I needed this today, thank you
Take a shot every time he says regressive
But we should never forget that films are made by imitating society and not the other way around...
I have a greate idea for you make video in hindi language.
Make a video on big budget wrong casting movies like players, phantom etc
I&#39;ve said it and I&#39;m saying it again ! How you don&#39;t consider the timeline when those films were made and how men&#39;s mind set was and......you want &quot;reality&quot; in the films
Abe angrej Hindi bolne me sharm aati hai kya...
Movie ka naam hi pheli baar sun raha hu
Why u speak in English Hindi bolne me sharm aati hai 😂
You should do tullywood. [Tamil &amp; Telugu] films.
I love your take on things including women’s rights. Such a refreshing point of view
Bulandi should not be in the list.. getting them married was common at the time of panchayat raj.. It is ok according to time of movie..
your english is wawooo<br>doesn’t mean u can just say anything , what the €£¥% you know about movies ?
narsimha waz gr8.....!
Anmol we are get bored of these type of contents... please introduce something new to us.
Shakti Kapoor characters are such a pain in the butt for humanity. I automatically tune off when I see him on screen. It’s just too painful to tolerate anything that he does on the screen. 😣
Hahahaha hahahaha maza aaya gyi🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂 <br>Kon SA zada funny tha I can&#39;t say but I think that dailogue, &quot;agr Mai rat Ko din or din Ko rat kahunga.....&quot; <br>Is stuck in my mind😆<br>&quot;Mtlb kch bhi &quot; series is the best one to me lol
Bhai itna sab kuch bata diya he to ye bhi bata deta ke Bollywood ki hindi movies ki illogical harkaten english men btane ka kia logic he???
Bulandi was a good movie.. and its based on old indian traditions. Plz dont see that with ur gender equality eye of today random world.
Matlab kuch bhi 😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=134">2:14</a> Best line ever hahaha
Bulandi was a movie about a Village and day to day life of the Villagers if you can remove the city glasses you may able to see <a href="http://that.it/">that.it</a> is not setting an benchmark but reviews the life in a Village.
If a Person calling Day = night and Night= day, he is just renaming the words nothing is going to change.
Ur handsme ur pic in last secnds is cool
Aam???????😂😂😂
Only few scratches on Urmila&#39;s face after falling off the cliff!? Waah bhai waahh 🔥
Hindustani sabhiyata, pati se pehley patni nahi khaana.. Lol... lekin yehi hindustan ko aaj triple talaq mein zyada dilchaspi hai... Looolll.. India is still the same, it has not changed &amp; never will
i like your video very much <br>can tell me the name of your channel  intro music plz
You asked an idea for your channel, then here is one idea, make a whole &quot;MATLAB KUCH BHI&quot; video on Race3 plzzzzzzzzz, now say what an idea sir jee☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
can you please use a better quality mic?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=140">2:20</a> man looks like Vani Kapoor
Topics seems to be getting repeatative
Please please please add English subtitles to the parts in hindi
Please make a video about loha (1997) film of Dharmendra and mithun. Such a disaster movie it was.
Good job bro👍
dude! I can&#39;t believe u have to watch such films
Awesome 😍
Make a video on &quot;How did they shoot that&quot; Scenes that are very Difficult to shoot but they did it. ☺️
Happy new year dear
Watch the movie saat saal baad starting suresh oberoi
Thora monotonous ho gaya content. Come up with something different next time.
Anyone other than me who finds this guy&#39;s voice mildly irritating?? No offence...:p
Dude do you seriously watch all these movies. If yes, then mad respect for you.
Narsimha is an iconic movie......
Rekha kutti
What shakti kapoor has replied to his mother, that is how todays liberal, fiberal,leftist, lal salamis serves their agenda
only legends can think...<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Why Jammy always needs 4 pants.. Hmmmmm....
Tried and Refused Productions - you are the best!  You come up with so much gems.
Dude natamai is a superhit film....but Indian women were more like that in those times...they are not illogical scenes...u should remove it from this list...but I don&#39;t involve in dialogues, because they were not the same in Telugu and Tamil..that alone could be bizzare
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=207">3:27</a> 😂😂🤣🤣
That representation of eating after your husband shit is still going on. For example Tarak Mehta ka oolta chashma were old person wants  family dinner which only include his son, grandson and himself were daughter in law being member of family just have to serve. This is representation of whole family eating together. You should make video about illogical thinh on Tarak mehata ka oolta chashma, I bet it will take more than 10 video to show it.
Bhai kabhi Hollywood ke baare me kuch dikha diya kar.Logic to sabhi film industry me nahi hota
Narsimha was that bad, bro.
Bulandi is a fab movie man!!!!<br>How can you put that film in this list????
Girlfriend movie was shit and very bad representation of lgbtq community like seriously kuch bhi. And actor in interview said they support lgbtq, like seriously with this shit you want to show support. No person turn gay job St because they are abused by opposite sex. But what can we say about Bollywood who still show gay man as looser and obsessed for hero.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=339">5:39</a>  a dummy lool
The only problem with your channel<br>-You talk too much about the scene and show too less about it.
Where do you find these gems?
Are you brother of Fit Tuber??<br>Your voice is very similar to him.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=255">4:15</a> what Dharmendra has said I think we all wanted to say the same thing to Manoj Kumar
Please make a review on movie bulandi.... i have watched that movie... and it is unapologetically bizarre which shows fucking regression. Please its a request 🙏🏿
Bulandi is one of the fine movie of that time, its easy to judge now. This time u choose wrong movie.
When rekha speaks in English just to show that though she is highly educated n is no less than her sister in law  still is typical pativrata n thus she shud  follow her
Wt the fuck did I watched?
Haa bhai ab Hindi me bolna
Elbowing eent k walls...😂😂
<b>No matter what..... they always blame women</b>
Hey. Great channel. Would you make a video about feminism and film. (Talking about movies like Veere Di Wedding, mardani etc)
Honestly. The thing about &quot;biwi ko pati ke khana khaane ke baad hi/saath mei khana chahiye&quot; is sorta true and should run vice-versa too. It&#39;s not retarded thinking. It&#39;s a manifestation of love jo Dil se aata hai, tutor Karne ki zaroorat nahi. When you love someone toh you naturally run back and forth around them. Unfortunately, in our society it is reduced to a measure of woman&#39;s sanskar &amp; is not expected of men to extend the same love for the wife. Men are OBLIVIOUS of a woman&#39;s need of love &amp; acceptance as an equal partner.
The &quot;hum itna piyenge hi ni&quot; was seriously kuch bhi moment 🙄<br>BTW, can you please make some content on hindi serials? There will be plenty of &quot;kuccchh bhiiii&quot; scenes there😁
Can you please give me full name of the title music.. Thxs..
Wait what about the thumbnail?<br>Why do u put pic of scenes u won&#39;t talk about
A very good list <b>Anmol</b> , movies of the 90s &amp; early 2000 had this kind of logic(read nonsensical)😀😀😉.. But now, bollywood&#39;s style of movie making is changing e.g. women centric, content based movies etc... But still we can find <b>Matlab Kuch Bhi</b> in movies...😁😁😂 Hope, dheere dheere aadat jaaye....
I just thoroughly enjoy &quot;matlab kuch bhi&quot;...😄 Hope to see more videos like this.
😂😂😂😂
Gobalists funded these disgusting films, I&#39;m telling you
Good that we came out of all these silly things India use to follow just by telling... Yeh to is desh ki parampara hai...u know like <br>Parampara... Pratishtha.. Anushasan... 😅
It seems 1990-2005 was the dark age of Bollywood
Well d dialogue by Rekha ji is actually right , it&#39;s not cringeworthy  bcz I too hv listened many times frm people around that in Indian custom a wife should either eat with her husband or after him as a sign of showing respect , love and dedication towards towards him. Just that.
You took my suggestion to watch bulandi!! Yay. You didn&#39;t even talk about older Anil kapoor randomly dropping dead cause he &#39;gave an unjust verdict&#39;.
Bhai! Tumhara sardi kab thik hoga.
Why u change background music...
MATLAB Kuch bhi vs bharo maang meri bharo <br>Only Desi
So from here hardik pandya got inspiration !
dude control the volume. The first what literally burst my ear drums. Also who in his right maind wants to and will  even watch Maidan E Jung. The fact that you watched is a amazement.
Need a part 2 as well...cover tushar kapoor&#39;s movies as well
aam 😢
You put in a lot of work. The absurdity of Bollywood must have scarred you at a young age or  this is just penance for wasting your time watching all this back then.. :D ;p<br>P.S. Love the monotone. :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=120">2:00</a> Jamy spotted 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro you chat so much shit sometimes
Bhai hindi me bano videos me dil se chata hun ki apka channel grow kre
what&#39;s your problem with 90&#39;s and 80&#39;s how many Good films are made this time you are bringing good movies and saying they are cringe worthy please stop insulting others it was very irritating I am unsubscribing you completely
Bulandi was one of the most regressive movies i have ever watched.
Manoj Kumar is the worst actor
Maidan e Jung should be no 1
Matlab kuch bhi   B-)
Bhai jon-tron copyright infringement laga dega
Bulandi was one of the best work in bollywood to show the intense level of villain and culture of india which can&#39;t b understood by today&#39;s nuclear family person so think before speaking
In the 90&#39;s, entire Bollywood was madarchod!😤 How the fuck did they show men raping women on such a big screen?👿
Its still the same my friend by just making progressive movies you cant improve this society people just want to watch progressive movies but when it comes to actually follow up on that they&#39;ll deny and say its not our culture and behave the same way we&#39;ve been behaving for 1000 years
Dedicate a series to Shakti Kapoor please.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=337">5:37</a> she dead, for sure.
Hindi me bol na
Video banana hai tho mathlab &quot;kuch bhi&quot;?
Liked before watching &#39;coz i know you will make great content.....<br><br>After watching....i&#39;m damn correct.....lv u...
Even the thumbnail is too depression.<br>I&#39;ve to fast forward,10 sec to go through this fuckin&#39; so clinging cut scene videos.<br>Damn It&#39;s too hard to even watch this stupid cut video.
I wonder how do yoh make these videos ??? I mean you don&#39;t watch all of these movies and then create a list.... because if you did that you would have been dead by now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Producing Cringy content is India&#39;s hobby ,look at every single show on TV by EKTA Kapoor.
Hello Taran Adarsh ke chote  भतीजे,<br>Tumhre chacha kaise hain,<br>Tum dono chacha bhatijon Ko Sharm nhi aati,<br>Paid critics Bankar,<br>Simba Ko super hit tumne bola tha na,<br>Sala kal Mai dekha,<br>Sabse ghatiya movie <br>1 scene Ranvir apni gun par hath rakhta hai bar bar, <a href="http://kam.se/">kam.se</a> mam 15-20 min yahi dikhaya gya,<br>Over acting <br>Aisi <br>Jaise never seen before 😡😡
Last time I checked even Indian gods used to eat with their wife...so how did it became INDIANS culture where wife has to eat after husband? <br>The middle age..<br><br>It all started in the middle age... When some regions of India became patriarchy..and then it infected the entire India..<br><br>Neutralism is India&#39;s culture.. At least That&#39;s what I understood by reading ancient history of our culture...
This was fun to watch 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Naya saal par vahi pura content. Bro kuch alag kar lae😌
My brain is absolutely bonkers!
How do you carry out your research on such films?
How absurd are daily soaps in India...please make a video on those too...which are running on television for like ever 😥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=446">7:26</a> what&#39;s wrong in that...
Clickbait
I actually watched the movie Bulandi 😕 I felt it is absurd even in early 2000&#39;s<br><br>Even that Narsimha movie! Omg Sunny deol literally demolish a whole palace with his arms!
Aao , main tumhe garam garam jalebi khilaooo!!!!!
Too Biased... U must be a Race 3 fan😂
Aao , main tumhe garam garam jalebi khilaooo!!!!!
I used enjoy watching bulandi but now after watching this video I got to know by the name of entertainment I was ignoring so much rubbish things
amm se kisko allergy hoti hai bc :(
We want more Kuch bhi...
Sir.. you can do similar video on Telugu movies.. I feel all of their hit movies are 0% logical 😁 but still they claim it as hit but I don&#39;t know how??
I disagree about your Maidan E Jung analysis. Widows are still mistreated in Indian society. All they tried to show was their plight may be not the best way but they tried.<br> These days our politicians say so many regressive and absurd things openly. At least give old movies credit for setting stage for change in society.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=370">6:10</a> bulandi movie <br>sahi h bhai <br>Uska theme hi wahi h <br>Kyuki pahele rural area me rape karne wale se Jyada bezati rape hone ki hoti h <br>Koi shadi nahi karta Puri family ki bezati hoti koi ristedaar izat Nahi karte <br>Wo suicide hi karte h Usse Acha h ki shadi Kara Dho but Abi badal Gaya
Girlfriend Is Definitely One Of The Most Cringeworthy Attempt To Make An Pure Lesbian Movies!!!!!!!Seriously Bollywood Has No Knowledge Of How To Make An Pure Film About This Relevant Topic!!!!!!!Also Audiences Have No Respect About These Kind Of Movies!!!!!!!!That&#39;s Why Great Attempt Like Fire Gets Banned From Theatres &amp; Manoj Bajpayee Didnt Win Any Award For His Outstanding Portrayal Of An Lesbian Character In Aligarh!!!!!!!!!
Make shocking Indian advertisement
Now Its Right Time For Old Age Actors Like Sunny Deol,Shakti Kapoor &amp; Dharmendra That They Should Take An Permanent Retirement From Bollywood Because Nowadays Both Their Movies &amp; Acting Are Quite Irritating Which Is Not Suitable For Current Generations Who Are Now More Interested In Content Driven Realistic Movies In Today&#39;s Time!!!
The Reason Why Anil Kapoor Has Worked In These Cringeworthy Movies Because He Is Getting Huge Money From It To Take Care Of His Family &amp; That&#39;s Why He Want To Work In All These Movies By Not Caring About The Script Which Was Against His Wishes &amp; Prime Example Of That Is Race 3!!!

Apki bhaasha mere palle toh padh e nahi rahi🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Are Bhai Hindi me batah
To be fair movies like bulandi we&#39;re remakes of Telugu and Tamil films which highlighted and celebrated rural feudal values which are absolutely disgusting. Bollywood in general stupid though it is doesn&#39;t quite go that far.<br>Now to be fair to Tamil and Telugu films, there are many films set in the city which are critical of such values and are also hits. The feudal films are made by a few producers and filmmakers of the upper castes who are nostalgic for such crap lifestyle.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=134">2:14</a>
A giant thumbs up for the Thumb nail,  <b>matlb kuch bhi</b>
So true, some of those movies were so painful, it was downright embarrassing to watch! Really good video!!
bulandi showcases the realities of few rural areas and their panchayat.not a right choice for the list.
Its Naattamai not nattamai no offense😊
Dude...<br>I&#39;m so glad that you have an ideology that could actually change the nation.<br>Your videos bring on debates and every day a village is being inspired by you.<br><br>Do you have any idea how it is in the real world.<br>It&#39;s 2019 and still if a widow of seen, people turn their backs as they think she&#39;s bad luck.<br>There&#39;s no village in India where you wouldn&#39;t find a guy who asks about caste<br>Don&#39;t even start about girls...<br>The other day I over heard a govt. Employee passing mean comments on a girl who&#39;s wearing a kurta and jeans...<br>Just sitting and making videos isn&#39;t enough dude...<br>If you expect change<br>Get up and educate people who aren&#39;t educated...
BuLundi is cringy as hell
The fuck was happening here those days? Just what the hell?<br>These films play a key role in conditioning our mentality and my oh my this is wrong!

U mentioned all the star casts of maidan  e Jung but u didn&#39;t mentioned jaya prada with the star casts how creepy r u? Don&#39;t think jaya prada was an star of her time?

So here is my list for top vocabulary words that you won&#39;t understand in this &quot;Tried and Refused Productions&quot; video.<br> incoherent, regressive, ooze, agonizing, unabashedly, preachy, defiant, distraught, penance, heathen.<br>So that was the list guys write it down in the comments below if you have any other found words and please don&#39;t forget to follow our Instagram @jammypants4 handles right in front of you.<br>😂😂😂😁😁😁
man I wonder!! How can you watch so many of such cringe movies??
In 2000 people must have been like.. OK, 1900s ab khatam ho raha hai, let&#39;s all just take a massive dump on 2000 and inflict all the stuff we have been holding inside despite the illogic storms that were the 80s and 90s. &#39;cause new century to clean start karni hai...?
80’s and 90’s movies of Mithun and Dharmendra - YAAR, MATLAB KUCH BHI 😅😅😅😂😂😂<br>But you forgot Salman Khan movies, his movies are deserved to be on the list. 🤣
Ur content is amazing <br>Keep making more and more
Please do the video on Kuch bhi Comedy... On worst comedy movies ever
Khudgarz dariya dil..And all of the saas bahu drama like sau din saas ke and meri biwi ka jawab nahi.. u need to see those movies..😅
Can you just enjoy any movies at all!<br>And people say lots of thing that they don&#39;t actually mean.. and movies portraying that thing is not cringeworthy at least..
Top 10 web series
Salman khan ki film dekh lo 90s 80s ki yad taza ho jayegi
Bollywood is randiwood
Every single Indian film has cringy moments/dialogues in it. Right from the invention of Indian Cinema up to 2019. There is no perfect film. The dose of absurdity differs from a film to another. This is one of the reasons the world will never take Indian films seriously.
That Jontron part lol
BTW Bulandi Songs are Good Specially Kumar Sanu&#39;s Songs😊
😵😵😵😵😵😵
your conetent is awsome man i am watching you from last year and i think you have change your content in hindi
Bhai webseries  ke bareme batao aajkal itni achi achi web series ban rahi hai..jise aap Ghar mein family ke sath milke Dekh sakte khaskar ekta Kapoor web series..😀😁😀😁
Maidan e jung was hilarious.
I have left to watch bollywoods&#39; movie
Make  a separate video on bulandi... Please
Can you do a list of the most deserving wins of each of the respective Filmfare acting categories? Or like top 10/15? I&#39;d love to see who you believe to be the ultimate choice for Best Actor/Actress, Supporting Actor/Actress
Bhai there is one song from beta movie picturised on anil kapoor and madhuri dixit... listen that very carefully
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=119">1:59</a>, bro is that you???
We need &#39;Matlab Kuch Bhi&#39; merchandises. 😂😂
I like ur channel. Plz get over the past. U t getting redundant
Most of these movies actually exposed the deep rooted misogynistic approach of indian society in a bizarre manner. Its sad to see these movies but in a way they are the exaggerated version of our society n customs.
Why you do not have a playlist named &quot;matlab kuch bhi&quot; on your channel. It should be an official series of this channel.
What zzamana n past past u always chant.. Dont forget tlday, will also becom past one day n one crook like u vl be there for making fun of ur todays great realistic cinema.. How idiot r u serously.. Now u kuch bhi..
Those good old days of Bollywood when we could make fun of gays and lesbs and bobby darlings, I miss those days 🙁🙁
From your 90&#39;s collection, Bulandi is one that movie that I have watched.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=143">2:23</a>....who is he??😂
😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Come on bro. Don&#39;t roast old movies. Don&#39;t judge them as per current scenario.
But you seems to me equally stupid for not understanding the norms of the society at that times ... Also, the Society is continuously changing its boundaries  .. but it takes time .. <br>Remember the times when Sati System was normal and Raja Ram Mohan Roy had to fight a long battle in saving Widows to fire themselves in the pire of their husband .. this was a Positive change in society...<br>Sometimes Negative changes also included in social boundaries ... Social Boundaries are dynamic and good or bad changes take sometime for inclusion ...
Make a list of the films that were an experiment but actually did well at the box office
Fucktards ... calling themselves as director ,writer and so called Stars of Bollywood propagating bullshit in the society
Have you seriously watched all the films?I salute you for that
Cmon .. narsimhha was a gud movie
Narasimha was an enjoyable movie<br>It had some social commentary as well<br>Yes urmila car crash scene was stupid <br>The rape of a girl by rioting mob was genuinely terrifying and there&#39;s a scene where dimple goes to search for sunny deol at Red light area, and finds the local mandir k pujari who upon seeing her hides his face
Bhai tu movie crtic nahi ek bisexual feminst gandu hai. U only point out the anti feminst scenes from the same movies again and again. U suck dude.
You always post same video under different topic. Stop doing this
Please yaar... Do something new....
In the movie girlfriend, they made isha kopikar reveled her sexuality as if she is a ghost , or sin, or curse      It pissed me off
Try to create a 90&#39;s and knw generation similarity .....of chuityapa happens today also
Sick of this. Unsubscribed
Bollywood... Zindabad!! <br>😶
“Matlab kuch Bhi”.. why don&#39;t u have more subs?
Dialogue that shocked me in the movie girlfriend was when girl says &quot;I&#39;m a lesbian, a boy trapped in the body of Girl&quot; I was like WT*  man how can they make a movie if they doesn&#39;t know any Shhitt
so basically Rajnikant gives license to Shakti Kapoor to rape that girl every night legally, right?
When Film makers are born Doctors also said &quot;Matlab Kuch bhi&quot;
Why is Gunda missing in this list ?
U dont have more than 1m subs..kuch bhi😒😒
Happy Lohri and Utrayan bhai
Bro kabhi MAYA MEMSAB bhi dekh le😂😂😂
Release Matlab kuch bhi merchandise!!!
Request to you please watch kuch kuch hota hai as well😂
Hey yaar, plz ye Puri picture par aapka ek episode ban sakta hai...it&#39;s the more bizarre n funny film
The dialogues of Shakti Kapoor in Bulandi or Behavior of Amrish Puri are written to show them as extremely vile, villanous, cruel monster. They&#39;re designed to shock audience at the antagonists twisted thinking.
2.14 (hardik pandya)
True....this is really true....🙄🙄🙄✓✓✓✓
Gunda the moviee
Chutiya ho be tm
Surprisingly Mithun Chakravarty&#39;s film didn&#39;t come to this list <br>Oh boy!, Tried&amp;Refused Productions included him in every &quot;Matlab Kuch Bhi&quot; series video
&quot; Matalab kuchh Bhiiiiiiiiii &quot;
bulandi should not be in the list.
Amazing that u watch so many 90s movie that too the non likely one&#39;s.<br> I wonder whether u have a team or u do all the work by yourself, any wch ways ur content is always watchable and different, keep ur the good work 👍
Narsimha was great film.
👎👎
I think race 3  is a kuch bhi movie 😂😂😂😂😂
Now I ll go vomit in my mouth. :/
What bulandi taught us<br>.<br>If your cursh ignores you<br>Rape her so you will get to marry her<br>.<br>Hadd hai
Gajraa thakur toh ekdam paglaa gya😁😁😁
First of all..I don&#39;t like or support such bollywood films. But why dont you guys review South Indian films which lack logic. They are more in number than bollywood.
Don&#39;t see any logic issue in last part. Married woman eating after husband has done eating. Yes in cities we don&#39;t see such things but it&#39;s widely followed in village areas even till this day.
Apart from all the hardwork you did,thank you so much for not saying &quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot; in between 😂
Eating before your husband is still  considered as a taboo.. Movies are the reflection of society, so blaming the filmmaker is useless , they show what happens in the society.
eeeee...😬
I have made entire video for bulandi only, please check
Ahh Ahh dil khush ho gaya<br>😍😍😍matlab kuch bhi episode se<br><br>Please can you make a video on compromise ending of love story.. Like kabhi ha kabhi na... <br>Mujhe kuch kehene hai.. (ignore bad acting of kareena) <br><br>That teach us lesson not to go mad or violent to obtain love
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyYV2QDH48&amp;t=200">03:20</a> it is not a mistake of the filmmaker.. Widow women are still facing such humiliation and it was very much prevalent those days..and this is why being widows is always considered as the biggest curse coz people consider widows as a  burden.
Bro can you try something different other than movie content, like before . This is just a request coz we know how fucked Bollywood is.
I swear I watched this in the middle of coaching class
Bulandi should have been made in early 90&#39;s BECOZ then the social structure in villages was like that... <br><br>Rajni&#39;s judgement to Shakti kapoor was to marry a lowercast girl whom he has molested therefore ensuring her a future...<br>That was the social structure then and it was well received by audience
Fook u All the way BRUHH <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23haters">#haters</a>
Progressive and regressive ka MATLAB kya hai ...  Road Pai nude ghumna progressive hai, English bolna progressive hai ets .. matlab western ko fallow karoho gaye progressive ... Kon tay karega kon progressive hai kon regressive hai
Bro why u keep on making the same video again and again,😐
Great
Aisa hai.. tumhara bhi level gir raha hai
They can be listed but weren&#39;t these films showcasing the reality of the society? I guess thats how women were treated in the past and thats what society actually believed is right.
Gunda
Yo ask Bollywood do a movie on Abdul Kalam use your connection I would pay to watch
Nothing shocks me about Bollywood
No doubt South Indian industry is presenting some very good movies but even so they are still showing sexist and male dominated characters in lot of movies
Ajkal to bas propaganda chalta h... Sanju, APM, Uri, thackrey, and now modi bio...
Abe hindi bolle bhai
Pyar ka punchnama in upcoming times
Hui chokri jawaan re

Time ke saath hamara chutiyapa bhi change hote rehta hai...<br>Us time humlogo ko aaise chutiyapa logic wale movies normal lagte the...<br>Aaj itna bhi utna hi chutiayapa bhara hua hai jo kal change ho jayega...<br>Chutipaya is forever, somwthing like Rishta wahi soch nayi...
Haha why did you watch these??
Can you please cover the ending epilogue of the 2003 movie Khushi? <br><br>For anyone who hasn&#39;t heard it do yourself a favor and go check it out. The whole movie is a unique gem of it&#39;s own, but that epilogue is really something else.
Man, please don&#39;t stop this series ever !!!😂😂

I remember those days when my elders use to rent these movies on VHS for a movie night while I doze off after 10 each time not finishing a single movie ever.
Atleast somebody is criticizing these warna all indians r like &#39;t series zindabad&#39;
Bollywood goes crazy sometimes.
is it me or has this channel become repetitive, I feel I&#39;ve watched this video like 10 times already
You should have not made this video lol
Shakti kapoor is cringemaster gogo.🙄
U can make a video on all anurag kashyap movies
