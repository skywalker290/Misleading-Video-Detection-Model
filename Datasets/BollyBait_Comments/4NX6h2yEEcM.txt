Pearly mam ❤
It sounds like..next level of social distancing...😁😁<br>Actors dnt even knw who and which other actor is there😄😄
🤟🤟🤟ludoo
Pankaj Tripathi is so likable! He more than deserves all the good things that happen to him.
How is it cool to make sex jokes with a child on the call?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=570">9:30</a> I just realised there&#39;s a child in this video who didn&#39;t get it.
Who is the lead role in ludo?
Mam mujhe koi food nahi mila sweet words from little girl
Par ye movie ka 1st to last Pankaj Tripathi ka hi ha. 😅<br>And Abhishek&#39;s humor came from young Jaya Bhaduri.
Am i the only one who is missing rajkumar Rao and Fatima 🤔
Ludo is good movies and fantastic movies and comedy and fantastic
Rohit😍❤
Pearle manney 😍
Best film of this year I think
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ludo">#Ludo</a> is a Mind-blowing movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=133">2:13</a> is best joke
Look at that little girl&#39;s swag while sitting... Already a herooo!!!!
Why you do interview in English it&#39;s better if it&#39;s in Hindi it&#39;s india yaar nd it&#39;s hindi cenema hindi movies
Abhishek bhai big respect for u bhai cha gye is movie me💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕👍
Ludo team did not recognise asha&#39;s Acting in the film.....partiality... Team
only watched it for inaayat
Why is no one talking about how cutely inayat speaks ❤️
ADITYA ROY KAPOOR REACTS VERY RARELY
Boycott paid reviewer shameless Anupama
Missing king of verstality;)
Bittu is a real winner 🥺😊
Abhishek is love ❤️
Abhishek bacchan acting🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aditya and Abhishek are such gems and are so underated!!
Best team...movie is really awesome. Love Anurag and team.❤️
Rohit❤

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2opd1da8sw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2opd1da8sw</a> plaese find me this song running in background  ludo movie
Thar little kid is so damn confident
Abhishek is a very nice actor...please don&#39;t keep trolling him
This is the best film in bollywood in history according to me.
Rohit❤️❤️❤️
Adii😘😘😘😘 and pearly chechiii
Pearly chechi😍🥰🥰🥰
Rohit❤️❤️
Happy to see a malayalam actor in the film companion...Im watching this interview just because pearley maaney is here....I&#39;m happy for her....wish her more luck...😘😘😘
<b>I&#39;m here for inayat verma</b>
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=515">8:35</a> Speaking of absurdist, That little girl has to be a part of the &#39;naked man murder scene&#39; discussion! :(
Movie was awesome
Idk why Abhishek is so underrated... He&#39;s really good... Also love for Rohit ❤
where is Rajkumar????
Omg! Inayat is a gem
Bittu&#39;s meeting with his daughter 😭😭😭 saw it twice and cried twice. Abhishek is really good.
Everywhere I go I read pearley lol
inayat also in the video if u remember anupama chopra mam
Movie was awesome man!
Abhishek is a show-off...all he wanted to seek attention
Pearly chechi feel proud 😍😍😍😍
Yeh bachi aik din bari ho kar Aaliya bhut bane gi♥️💋<br>Patakha guddi🤗
Very enjoyable show but I missed Raj and Fatima🥰
Bollywood me film companion लोग ऐसे अग्रेंजी झाड़ते जैसे मानो मैकॉले आ गया हो।फेकू कल्चर so called  इंगलिश एलीट इनके दिमाग से   निकालना बहुत जरूरी हैं ।
If Abhishek could accept the tip Anurag gave to Pearle about acting, he could become much better.. But being a part of such movies will teach him a lot, also felt like he was imitating the Great Bachchan in some part of his role in this movie.
Isi film me shah Rukh ya salman hota to lauda ban jata film ke badle
waiting for pearly to speak✌✌<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=320">5:20</a> she starts<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=1103">18:23</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=1465">24:25</a>

Lovely movie..... Enjoyed it a lott.... 👌👌👌👌
I genuinely love AB❤ His real self, kindhearted, soft spoken, humble, warm-hearted, gentleness and selfless humour sense is what flattered me. Always will be my favorite one on and off screen. He deserves what he should actually deserve.Endearingly, Love him❤
ARK cast was excellent...
Good break for Abi Bachan!! Happy for him..overall the star cast too good and exclusive...
Sorry but a part of the movie was copied from a Japanese movie Adrenaline drive. Scene to scene copy.
Pankaj Tripathi, u dont know how good u were in the film..
Pearly 😍
Great movie and great team hats off to the director and actors 😀
Bullshit bollywood.. malayalm cinima adipoli..

Mr .Abhishek.  You are a great actor. I see new phases of you as an actor. I also liked the other movie you made with the missing child. Keep it up . Be you.
Ellarum odi vayo pearly

where is raj kumar rai and fatima😞
പേർളി ചേച്ചി poliyaanu😍😍😍😍
Long live every Bengali director in Bollywood ❤️❤️❤️
What a wonderful movie this was! Thoroughly enjoyed ❤️
Mr Anurag Basu-ur storyline is good but showing nurses in bad light was totally uncalled for👎really hurtful especially in a time where frontline workers are risking their lives ...
I hope the kid was not exposed or audible to the double entendre conversation happening. Kindly keep kids in a seperate video next time

Pearle adipolli 👍
Abhishek ,perly😍😍😍
If this film would have release in cinema hall, then it may surely break the mark of 200Cr
Abhishek Bachchan and  Mr Anurag Basu are the coolest Han beings
Abhishek has not been very lucky with films. Always compared with his father. He is a good actor
Pearle...luv from Andhra❤️.. what&#39;s wrong with Abhishek.. he&#39;s cutting other&#39;s..intruder.....
Druggy hain sare
Love video to you my friend
Pearly wow
Jr Bachhan has a great humour
No everyone can work with so many well known actors. He made it sure to do it and pull it so well. Applaud to him. Everyone were best in their characters !
Pearly 👍👍🤩🤩🤩🤩
Abhishek Bachchan is a gem underrated mostly. Believe me, just watch Guru,Sarkaar and Ravan,Bluffmaster
I ❤️ Pankaj Tripati ji(our Kaleen Bhaiah😂😂).. Great actor😘😘
Inayat is sooo cute 😍
Pearly mutheee
I am glade they called that child 🚸
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=540">9:00</a> savage abhishek 😂😂
Why does Abhishek have an accent living in Mumbai ? So weird
This kerala actress is way too pretty
Who all are here for pearly.....proud of our pearly...❤️❤️❤️കേരളത്തിന്റെ മുത്ത്
Legend on screen... Pankaj Sir ❤️
Ok, for all those who are raving about this movie, it had a lot of elements from illuminati- directed Hollywood movies.<br>Right from toilet scenes, to casual sex while seeking someone else to marry to pouring urine over someone and showing naked butts. (Masonic) In the end, there is even an outright Atheistic dialogue where the character says, &quot;God and Devil are just created by man&quot;. MARK MY WORDS: We will get to see a lot of these in the upcoming movies- casual sex, naked butts, urine and toilet scenes, preposterous ideas about God. It all will be done in a very playful, joyful way that no one will even notice it
This movie is just awesome
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=540">9:00</a>...only good sense of humour can understand this
Only rohit😍♥️
Pearle ❤️
I missed the best actor of this film, The  RAJKUMAR Rao. The real hero of this film, best acting, portrayed the character differently, which was a real challenge i see.
Abhishek did a great job....he was fantastic seriously
Wow, All idiot morons in one frame. So nice. No doubt Bollywood is gutter Capital of India.
rajkumarrao n fatima carried the whole film.,and they are missing
I dnt like aditya Roy Kapur.
whenever i see abhishek i see Dhirubhai ambani in him... he played the role so gracefully
We need a separate SOLO interview with the kid . She needs more attention.
Mas film hai yaar. Very interesting, tragic, comedy and drama. I love it so much.
I have seen  movie  now . What a movie   .  my opinion  Great  movie .movie  wahi jise dekhate time app ka flow  bana rahe and at any point  feel no bore .Great story and fabulous  director  . India  need this type of movie  to represent  India  worldwide  . Every  character  have their  own  value  . Kuch na kah kar bhi sab kah dena <br>Wish u luck  all team  members of ludo <br>🤗🤗👍👍👍👍👍🤩😍🥰

Where are green people 🤔
Awesome movie....your personality, innocense reflect in your movie Anurag Basu...
Pearly♥♥
Pearlyyyyyyyy🥰
Abhishek is such a wonderful person!!
You all should be ashamed of yourselves,,, you are all fake human beings.... the real hero for us, is, was and will be Only and only SUShanT Singh Rajput..... justice for SSR.
Why asha negi is not here? You people have wasted asha&#39;s talent. She is the most natural and  gifted actor of our times.
ohhh that tiny one is also on the panel lol cute!
Pearly 😍♥️♥️♥️
I think all of the adults forgot about a child being in the interview as well!!!!!
Pearle chechi♥️
Abhisheks acting is beyond good now
Best one of 2020❣️
Excellent movie
Pankaj tripathi s the best one
അടിപൊളി സിനിമ ആയിരുന്നു കേട്ടോ ഞാൻ ഒരുപാട് എൻജോയ് ചെയ്തു 😆😍👍
Fatima Seikh kidhar hain ??
I knew Abhishek was one of the most underrated actors and I hope we get to see him a lot more but his amazing sense of humor was a revelation...Loved every bit of the movie....very refreshing style of story telling...kudos to Anurag Basu for writing it in the first place and then directing such an ensemble...this movie has a lot of recall value according to me. While rest of the cast are more seasoned, I loved Rohit, pearley, inayat and the other nurse who is paired with Pankaj...fabulous cast...the only character that was a little annoying was that of Rajkumar...he did a great job but it’s just the way it was written...that dancing after a point became annoying...I’m sure there are people who would like to disagree but it’s just a personal choice...all in all a fun movie...Do highly recommend it
Nice film. I watched this film. Best of luck <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamludo">#teamludo</a>.👍👍👍👍👍💝💝👏👏
I&#39;m here tojust hear Inayat
Fantastic movie loved pearly and AB,❤️🥰 AB back with a bang👍
That sweet little girl Inayat did great job than anyone else in Ludo
Lovely interview! Loved Inayat, Abhishek &amp; Rohit. So genuine :)
But many questions are still there... Why was the man murdered
Now everyone finding Abhishek bachaan very talented n ironical comedian......😶
After ludo, i realised how malyalam actors are so fucking famous
Pearly chechii 🌈❤️
Abhishek ji should do stand up comedy, he indulges in any conversation flawlessly. 🍛
This movie was the best movie of this year...Everyone of them were class apart, just all of them...But I am too much in love with Pankaj Tripathi, Abhishek Bacchan, and young kid....Congratulations to the whole team ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Loved it!! But vry bad network 😶
where is rajkummar rao
Did you forget to ask Aditya Roy Kapoor, what he learned from dada? Or did I miss it?
Why wasn&#39;t Raj kumar a part of it?
The kid look clueless most of this 😂 cutee
Flop
This Movie will be a Gift to Pearley&#39;s Baby... ❤️
Like the climax song very much.<br>Why it is not available on LUDO album?<br>Need full version of that song.
Loved them all. The film was weird, long and so absurd but I liked it a lot. Especially Abhishek whom I found outstanding, I am happy and eager to watch him in his best roles from now ! New career to him, he deserves the best. I also loved Pankaj Sir&#39;s &quot;love&quot; story that was surprising and sooo funny. This interview is great vibe and great to watch ! Great people !
I like AB as a person, the way he talks and his amazing sense of humor.. But i do feel he should do better as all the other actors are exceptional..
Missed rajkumar rao.. He was outstanding and super cute.. 😍😍<br>Pankaj tripaathi was great as always..
Aditya Roy Kapoor is a natural actor no change in his acting
Love love love the movie......best movie .❤️❤️❤️
Abhishek should start his own chat/comedy show... He is absolutely hilarious in a self depreciating way!! 😀
It was not absurd. This genre is known as black humor.
Brilliant cast!
Sattu bahiya is d real gem and lead actor of this movie despite being the villian in this
Superb movie 👌👌👌👌 anurag basu love you ❤️ from chhattisgarh
Abe ye log hindi nahi bol sakte kya???

Pearly uyr❤️❤️
Feeling sorry for the kid 😆
Miss rajkumar
Pearlyyyyyy❤😍
Abhishek Bachchan acts well with the beard, and Ludo was a fun movie😁
🙄
Lido used these icon Bhagwan dada to their promotion such selfish ppl  all of you
Abhishekh bachhan great actor
I watched today LUDO....Its a masterpiece....Great stories,cast,performances...Its 2020&#39;s best film..!!
Pearly baby..  love u..  proud of u...
fatima sana shaikh is missing
I think she forgot to invite Rajkumar rao and Fatima Shaikh
This interview is a laughter show and abhishek is the best with his sense of humour 😂
Rohit is a gem actor
Ye ek south indian remake h ..trailer dekh k jhatkk pta chl rhaa🤔🤔🤔
Good movie congratulations to all
All of them was too good in the movie😍😍😍😍😍😍.Pearly💕💕💞💞💞💞💞💞♥️
Why Rajkummar Rao and Fatima Sana Saikh aren&#39;t here?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=49">0:49</a> the pegion 🤣🤣🤣
Pearley and inaayath😍😍
Abhishek Bachchan.. You beuty ❤️❤️<br><br>You were hilarious 👍🏻👍🏻
Pearly 😃👌
https://youtu.be/4wQJAdT-cdk<br>Watch the beautiful recollections from the life of dearest PEARLISH. <br>Peace, love and music to all❤
Oh god!! Is it only me who thinks tht rohit is super cute and handsome ❤😘😘😘  and love aditya roy kapoor too 😍😍
Rajkumar Rao as Aalu makes this film a hit.... Would&#39;ve been a disaster like Jagga Jasoos if Aalu&#39;s character was badly acted. Rao deserves all the praise,the film&#39;s fate was dependent on how well he plays Aalu.
Pearly❤️❤️
Emotions make this  film better<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ludo">#LUDO</a>
Perley chechiii
This comment here has more words than Aditya Roy Kapoor had in the video...
Unnecessary and awkward laughs by Mrs.chopra..
Ludo for me was the best one in 2020..lovely writing and mixing characters..
Useless questions by chopra..she is looking most dumb .
Only here for Pankaj Tripathi
Raj is also promoting challang...and fatima has to promote Suraj le mangal bhari....i think its do sweet that they let them promote....since lodu has so many actors but they both are leads of their respective films.....so stop complaining why they aren&#39;t their.....but just saying....they were too good in the film....Dada bought most unexpected but beautiful fresh pairs.....Dada thanks for lodu.....
Watching this only for our pearle maaney.😎
Rahul avasthi the silent boy........I felt on him....😘😘😘😘
Adityaaaa is 💕💕💕💕
after ludo:- mere dil me Abhishek utna bura actor nahi hain, ye kheyal aya🌞
Superbly crafted and superbly acted by all... Its one of the Anurag Basu&#39;s Gem... I never seen a mix of story.. where all dots are connected so perfectly...
I wish “Ab wo baate rahi nhi” song by Nikhil D’Souza was part of official music too. Beautiful song! <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JZO8muQ6u4">https://youtu.be/0JZO8muQ6u4</a>
Bull shit
Perale chechiii 😙😘😘😍fans 👍
Hats off to that small little girl who just patiently listened to them with many of the things not understood👍🏼
Anurag basu loves girls with curly hair<br>First Kangana Ranaut now Sanya Malhotra &amp; Pearlie Maaney all jewels❤️❤️❤️

how can an under 30 chap be Mithun Fan? Unconvincing
Aditya Roy  Kapoor is amazing. He is so underrated.
Ab&#39;s performance just outstanding 👍 always loved his performance glad he&#39;s back with a bang 👍✌👍👍👍
I am an Abhishek Bachhan fan from the very begining..and I&#39;m proud of it. He is mind blowing.
Abhisekh and Pankaj should do more movies together
kinki nazar sirf pankaj ji par thi
Awesome work
Only for our own PEARL... PEARLY 😍🥰
I am wondering why Rajkumarrao and Fathima didn&#39;t join this interview :(
Pearly maney...❤️
I&#39;m a simple woman. I see Pankaj Tripathi, I click on the video
Why is Tapori Nepo kid Abhishek Bachchan showing off his English skills such a privileged loser
I want to see more of AB movies in years to come♥️.. just love his acting 🤩
&quot;Shame on you pearly Mani&quot;<br>When they asked you about south industry you just blindly lied that here actors &amp; directors don&#39;t speak or chitchat each other ....&amp; they just come &amp; ask you what is your input into the movie..It is a utter nuisance l have watched lot of mallu  celebraty interviews where they say they had lot of fun in movie set ..which director is harsh in Malayalam ?? You should mention their name..do you know directors like Lal, basil , all directors over here is very cool &amp; make you comfortable ..<br>Pearle it&#39;s shameful to forget where you come from &amp; who all made you this star🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Curley pearly🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤
Pearle maney 😍😍😍<br><br>Keralites 😘😘😘
Omg ..this movies deserves 100 oscars!!
Great to hear all of them! Anurag seemed to prefer listening to all his actors rather than describing his film. Cheers to all. Thanks to Anupama for these lovely moments.
I think the small girl is feeling bored, when others talking.... <br><br>Samajh to aane ka nhi😂😆
Pankaj Tripathi Acting is just mind Blowing
Came here only to listen to Inayat 💜😍 superb bachcha she is.
Why Anupama  didn’t interview cast of scam 1992.??? Instead other guy interviewing only Pratik Gandhi..
Bekar movie
Where is rajkumar?
Pearley ❤️🖤
Pearly 😍
AB did fantabouls job... Especially when he looked his daughter on Bhanu&#39;s arm and she didn&#39;t want even to see AB...What a scene and AB just did it in fantastic way. Director even doesn&#39;t move camera..It&#39;s a single shot. Superb AB....Best wishes to you and team Ludo.
<b>awsm</b> 🌋🔥🌋🔥
Here just to watch and adore that cute little girl. Her acting was just too brilliant in the film

Abhishek bachachan is so underrated. I truly wish that he get scripts that highlights his potential..Congrats to the whole team of Ludo! Thoroughly enjoyed the movie..Proud to see Pearly making her debut in bollywood....Pankaj Tripathi is hands down one of the finest actors we have..i loved the whole plot of the movie and this kind of genre was much needed now! Kudos!!
Abhishek..dude u r not supposed only to fit the bloody cop on dhoom series.such a potential actor..Get some best scripts and lit🔥

Where is rajkumar rao
Instant is so cute 😍😍 while talking
Now I know Abhishek is underrated man love him and his sense of humor
The movie is so entertaining and stress free I thought which make sense now 😄 would be nice to see Rajkumar Rao too ( he was outstanding)
Where is Fatema and Rajkummar Rao
Why is Rajkumar Rao and Fatima Sana Shaikh not in this interview? Their roles and story was so important :///
It&#39;s all about the GOOD DIRECTON....that&#39;s all
Pankaj Tripathi Da role stole the movie. Abhishek and the little girl story was beautiful for me. Rajkumar Rao&#39;s Mithun mimicry was outstanding. What about you guys???
Sattu bhaiya cha gaye aap

For those who are commenting I am here for pearly maney.. <br>Movie consist all gr8 stars..<br>U r here for entire team ludo.
where is raj kumar &amp; fatima?
In awe of the calm composed Abhishek Bachchan ❤️
Ludo is a useless movie . Just pumping a movie full of out of work nepotist actors like Abhishek &amp; Aditya &amp; getting ppl to act silly &amp; just flitting from one scene to another is hardly entertaining Gareebo ka Guy Ritchie ? The whole movie has a an assembly line staleness to it ADRaiReview
Perly......😍😍😍😍😍😘
Never realised Raj kumar Rao could dance so well that too into scenes where person is stressed and about to cry.. that was the best part..imitating Mithun Chakraborty. Unbelievable!!!
Abhishek is really very good 👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=557">9:17</a> why r u looking like that yaar? ..that was cute🌸
Pearly😍😍😍
Mr Abhishek Bachchan and others.<br>Are u looking cool in English.<br>Speak and talk in ur indian language.<br>Shame on some of u

O betaji....o babuji...kismat ki hawa kabhi naram kabhi garam
Where is mr. Rajkumar?
I think Abhishek is the best star kid.
I feel like this is a good movie .. waiting to watch!
Pearly😍
I am finding Rajkumar Rao in this interview, he was phenomenal in the movie.
For pearly❤️
Seekho. Bade bade production house showing Richie rich lifestyle, should get motivated by the latest rise of OTT platform
Pearly doesn&#39;t know to speak fluently 🙄🙄
Pearly chechi 🥰🥰
“Hand held” was epic 😂😂
Missing raj...
Pearly Maaney😍
Good to see this side of Abhishek.
Aadi ❤️
That cute is acted so well and sooo clearly she speaks. Such a talent.
Just loved this movie...
इतनी भी अच्छी नही है मूवी
Everyone acted very well in this movie. This movie is very fun and enjoyable
Pearle maaney😍😍😍🥰
Awesome cast and movie ❤️ missing fatima and rajkumar here
One of the worst movies of last couple of years. Anurag Basu is overrated !!!
Watching this interview just because of one great ACTOR  PANKAJ TRIPATHI.  What am ACTOR 🙏🙏🙏
Abhishek is a very good actor. Actually acting really comes down upon the directors hand, how much he can take the best acting from an actor. Good director can do it from every actor. Abhishek is a very polite and gentleman.
Rohit is on full josh with mismatched and ludo <br>WOW 🤯
The kid&#39;s mother put up a &#39;ludo&#39; design bedsheet. Such a cute gesture.
Comment section only for pearly...such an optimistic person....lv u pealyyyyy........keep going.....
Hey really like your channel, my channel has FILMMAKING content as well, any support would be really appreciated!
Pearle 🥰
Abhishek Bacchan is a good human being ❤️❤️

Abhishek Bachchan is so good and talented actor. ☺
Loved the movies...
The film was shit . Why waste 30 minutes talking about it ! The only saving grace was Raj Kumar Rao and he’s not here .
Abhishek great
Bhaiyo agar apko apni zindagi k 2.5 hours ki kadr h to is movie ko mat dekhna,isme na koi story h aur na koi direction aur na koi acting
It was a masterpiece
Cute girl yar
Bahut dino baad ek gajab ki film dekhne ko mili, thank you anurag dada, we all love you
Sweet Pearly..
Pearle looks very cute
Anupama mata ji har outsider ko bhi aisa hi treat karna
Missing Rajkumar Rao🤘🏻😎 The Mithun Da😅
O beta ji! Oo babu ji Qismat ki hawa kabhi garam kabhi naram kabhi naram garam kabhi garam naram.
Pearly ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Abhishek is such a nice, well mannered person and looks charming coz he has light hearted humour when he speaks 🤗<br>No wonder Aishwarya chose him man ❤️ <br>There are many rich ppl around and she can pretty  well get em <br>But she went on to marry this person and now we see why ... He is surely a gentle person and husband material 🤗
Where is Rajkumar and Fatima??
Pearle chechiii ....😍😍💙
anurag basu looks like a very down to earth guy.
where is rajkumar rao?
Abhishek is finally signing up for good scripts. Good for him.
Pearly uyir❤️🌟
Abishek nailed the interview
our pearly....
AB is so easy to listen to, so charismatic &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
Malayalis like adikk
Where are Rajkumar rao and Fathima Sana sheik <br>I feel Rajkumar rao was superb in the movie
Feels good that people can speak good about abhishek bachchan.yes he has his own identity and he is a bundle.of talent
Pearly maaney❤❤
Can someone tell me the title of the Beetaji Bapuji song and the movie it was originally sung in? Aswear that song gave a nice touch to Ludo.
All the cast did very good acting, I really liked Abhishek acting the most, he does such understated and subtle acting that I think some viewers and critics don’t get it, he doesn’t just jump or does overacting like SRK, Salman or Akshay. I find him better than Amitabh too
This movie is a spin off of a tamil movie &#39;super deluxe&#39;..not content wise but concept  wise...The only difference is that the tamil version didn&#39;t have a narrator and story was visually told.
Loved Abhishek and Inayat performance the most. There Unpredictable acting has suprised audience. Dil ko chooh liya.<br>Rajkumar &amp; Pankaj ji were as usual amazing.
Perly kutta....love u...😍💓
I liked it!
Abhishek sir has been my fav since long and he is one of the most under rated actor. He is really great actor
Everythg is good about the movie but at some point, I felt like degrading the profession of nurse. The scene with nurse and doctor was really unnecessary..... Can&#39;t appreciate it.
Abhishek bacchan character makes me emotional. Specially the background musix ❤️❤️ <br><br>Rajkumar rao steal the show 😅😅 i mean what a acting maa ki daal tadka maar ke <br>Fatima sana sheikh is mindblowing <br>Aditya n Sanya was ok ok <br>Pankaj tripathi as always incredible 😎 <br>Tripathi gesture 100% works in ludo <br>Child actor Is awesome thnkyou anuraj basu for giving her chance from indias best dramebaaz to Ludo ❤️<br><br>&amp; last but not the least the inspector actor ishtiyak khan .. is outstanding 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 his hieght and power voice is truely amazing 3 scenes all are significant 😍😎<br><br>Arijit pritam da music absolutely fantastic <br>After dhamaal after 13 years this was the movie which i watched 2times a day and never being bored .. <br>superbbb moviee everything was good <br>Something is new ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👏🏻👏🏻
It&#39;s cute how abhishek thinks everybody wants to hear him. And rest of the cast is like &#39;Ab to chup ho jaa bsdk&#39;.
Loved the movie <br>Such a good movie<br>Love from Kerala
Not sure if the little girl was really supposed to be in this call. Her replies were spot on but most of the content of the call would have flown past her.<br>Watched the movie, had high expectations. The acting standards were good. Abhishek Raj and Pankaj has a good arc but the other 2 stories did not have sufficient grit.
Pearly Maaney Love ❤️
Hey guys I feel that the interview should be in Hinglish because Pankaj Tripathi could not speak his view. Even many viewers  are not comfortable with English.
Pearly dear
Peraleee😍😍😍✌️
Abhishek tried too hard to give emotions..,He was not convincing in film. Rajkumar Rao stole the show...
Abhishek is so good in the 🎥 movie
Pearle, most underrated mallu actress!
Each of the 4 stories were nice but somehow I fell asleep half way through the film...
Very fanny AB😀😀🙌
Pankaj way of describing is unique ,
Pearly🥰🥰
Seriously thats most dumbest question to start a conversation.
Where&#39;s Rajkummar 😭?
Pearly 💓
Abhe sare English kyo bol rhe Hain hindi Film Hai bhailog Hindi mein Interview Karo plz...
It was quiet a delight to see. I really enjoyed it. Its worth watching it twice. The whole cast did it justice in their delivery and comedic timing.
Such a sorted and mature lil girl❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anupama DIdi 🤝 Son of Abish Bhaiya
All chat shows should have AB jr...IB Ministry should make that rule !
Loved the movie❤ ..only complain is Anurag stepping in front of camera with a pathetic beard to explain the plot..we, the viewers didn&#39;t need that 🤷‍♀️
Anurag basu !! Remember the name ....he is a genius!!!!....loved the movie 💯
I just watch it, after this interview, I paused it half way and go for the movie 😄
Abhishek was just best than all the other ones
Pearly you did very well.. loved the film❤
O beta ji😊
Missed Rajkumar Rao in this interview
AB just killed Anupama 😂😂
What was the need of showing indian gods...why not gods of any other community
pearly 😍😍
Pearly ❤️❤️
Rajkumar Rao did something supremely different again ♥️ along with Pankaj ji and the kid was a charm along with AB.
The kid is so thoughtful and articulate 🤗<br>Gesture ka Economy 👍 pankaji 🙏
Pearly
Fantastic job avishek!
Pearly Chechi 😘 fans like👍👍👍
No dobuts the graphics are amazing in movie so live movie so refreshing
What a movie even actors don’t no what’s going on
Watched this Movie and really  brilliant performance by all actors
Came here for the whole team to watch once again ❤️❤️
Nepo-KIds- Abhishek &amp;  Aditya steal roles from good and independent actors by calling and begging directors and producers, they get 1000 movies, and maybe in one or two they perform, and in their other movies, other good actors are made side actors. Pratik Gandhi is the best actor.
Where is the haters of abhishek .i recomend them  Please watch this film
That&#39;s nepotism for you, I&#39;m <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=390">6:30</a> into the video, i only see Abhishek and Basu, with a hint of Aditya Roy.
It would have been better to refrain from speaking x rated stuff especially when there’s a kid in the panel....the kid was the best in the whole movie...natural and innocuous....
It may not be believable by others and me that after the movie ended I had this feeling that something has been kept on my heart affected by Abhishek’s character....the foremost....
That naked question was inappropriate considering there is a child in the conversation. <br><br>Why does the kids need to be in the whole interview anyways?
Abhishek has been such a <b>capable</b> actor and it&#39;s really a shame we don’t get to see him use his acting abilities often. Kudos!
Love to C these guys in one platform 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
AB stole heart in the father daughter scene.  He is full of potential.
He mentioned something about Corona in the movie when he was talking with his companion in the beginning and that made me wonder when this was shot and if it was shot during the pandemic but then again that scene could have been shot separately from the others as an afterthought to keep with the times. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I loved the ensemble cast, so great to see the two actresses from Dangal together again in another film. Within the first ten minutes of the film I kept laughing and saying to myself this has a Guy Ritchiesque, Tarantinoesque dark humour of course not because I think Mr Basu doesn&#39;t have his own style, it just reminded me of those two that&#39;s all. And Pankaj Tripathi? 😂 He&#39;s such a dynamic actor, one minute a funny, quirky villain in one movie, the next he&#39;s the tag along funny guy in Fukrey who says the most absurd things. I wonder what goes on in that head of his. He&#39;s a favourite of mine.

paid pr for ab baby n the movie.
Ludo was very entertaining and deep
I think it ws a mistake to bring in the little girl into this chat but since she was there, the adults should hav been Careful not to discuss inapropriate topics
The movie is a classic
Here for Abhishek ❤️
Loved this entertaining movie, o beta ji......., Pankaj ji and Abhishek ji❤️👏
movie is super
Only hear for Pearle😀😀
I will love avishekh after this interview, &quot; absurdic tragic comedy&quot;&quot;..she always try to proove unnecessary wisdom.
Where are Rajkumar Rao and Fatima Sana Shiek
Mallus ivide hajrittittu pokuu.....<br><br>👇
But still not better than soorarai potru 🤭🤭🤭
Ludo is a movie that has to be treated like a roller coaster. Just board the roller-coaster and enjoy the ride.<br>One should not watch this movie using logic and reasoning or with the motive of finding its fault. It&#39;&#39;s a movie that should be used to watch to escape yourself from the stressful and monotonous life.<br>The movie manged to connect us with the characters and root for them and that&#39;s the best part about this movie.
Pearly maximum controlil aanalo :) ith abhinayamo atoh sherikum engane aayo??? abhinayam aanenkil excellent exactly she deserved the role and more.
I loved the movie. I wanted to watch this movie at Theatres
I didn’t like movie it’s very confusing
All were good in the film but Pankaj’s acting was the best. really natural and fresh.

Ludo outstanding movie best Acting best . music best background music best   .. screenplay best story best climax. ..
basu porn ko aise justify kar raha hai ki basu ki khud ki beti porn join karegi. Ek dialague mein Vashnodevi ke sath porn ka kaam dala gaya hai. Aur ye sab Sanatan hatred shuru ke 10 min mein hai
Abhishek is so underrated. Becoz of his film choice people think him as a bad actor..and he is very funny
Pankaj sir🤗
where is rajkumar rao!!
Abhishek funny
I just felt this interview so refined and so engaged i never felt even a bit disinterested.
Idhokke kaanumbol ranjjiniyeyum shwedhayeyum kinattil idaan thonunnu
Too be honest bich me bolne walle acche nahi lagte but people like RDJ and abhishek who have great senses humor i always expect to arre bhai tapak pad <br>Darti ko chir ke aasman ko faad ke aake bol.<br>One mistake done by interviewer is she should not include little girl and called fatima in her place.
Someone underrated because he was born as son of superstar AB i have seen abhishek since his debue he give very good movies but people doesn&#39;t appreciate it Indian just need these things<br>1) dance and body<br>2) sex or sexy scenes <br>3) some current big name<br>Thank god ye movie online aaya nahi tu Indian audience tu isko 100% flop banate aur baad me randi ronna like masan,trapped,tumbaad etc faced
Very good film! Anurag basu  we  are looking forward to your next masterpiece 👍

Just saw it.. Terrible movie. Had lot of copycat tricks and felt like a movie made of funny scenes stitched together with no time for stable story or plots.
Mirzapur,The F
Abhishek 😆
Pure Hinduphobia<br>1. Was it necessary to mock goddess kali?<br>2. Was it necessary to show SAYYED in ram leela?<br>3. Was it necessary to mock Ram Leela?<br>4. Was it necessary to show the character of shurpankha beating Laxman?<br><br>Moreover inserting you leftist propaganda by calling Arnab a Godi media by mocking him in one of the puppet act<br><br>This entire thing about Netflix is going beyond control please don&#39;t encourage this ek baar hua toh co incidence bol sakte hai baar baar we can see this pattern now<br>Those scenes of mocking hindu gods was totally unnecessary they didn&#39;t even go with the story
Pearly chechiii 🥰🥰🥰
Masterpiece film in 2020 ..
Pearle ....... so so sooo proud
Jr.AB should do more movies..He has best sense of humour and Impromptu ..Class apart👍
You can really see how comfortable Abhishek Bachhan is with an interviewer who gives him proper respect. In the interview with Rajeev Masand, he was clearly ignored while the rest of the cast was given multiple chances to talk.
Entire film was exciting.
I love Abhishek from the past few years.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=39">0:39</a> I stopped my 9-5 with the help of, <b>p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m</b>

Yehhhhh , Anupama&#39;s voice is back!!!
Anurag basu sir is back with the bang.He is a jem.
Guys royalty
I think I am gonna watch this movie only for the super cute kid Inayat! And bravo to Anupama for including her in the cast amongst Pankaj, AB. Where is Raj &amp; Fatima though!
Sanya is so f*<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23king">#king</a> attractive!
Only for abhishek bachchan
Only for abhi abhishek bachchan
the child is so so ocnfident, omg i need coaching from her :P
What&#39;s the release time?
Sanya and Aditya brought the hotness. Abhishek brought the coolness.
Perly 😍
Ye choti bachi ko pkka rhe ho yr!!
I love Abhishek ❤️
Great interview.. Just wondering why you never thought of doing same for the cast of scam 1992. Why this discrimination?
Rohit Saraf❤️
Little girl should not have been part of this interview.
Abhishek is underrated.
Where’s raj &amp; Fatima?
Abhishek needs to be on the next season of son of abish
I m only for abhishek and cute little she is so cute and innocent
Missing Rajkumar Rao
Abhishek is such a brat😂😂😂😂
&quot;Aap log seekh rahe hain ?&quot;
Missing Rajkumar Rao❤️😭
Rajkumar Rao ?<br>I thought he is also part of Ludo !
pearly curly FANS
Abhishek is love. 💜💜💜💜
Is there a need to edit the scenes in OTT? I mean cut the movie short? As everyone is at their comfort and watching movies does the length of the movie really matter? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askbr">#AskBR</a> also.
Such a cutie Inaayat! 💕💕
It is like Avengers where all the cast member don&#39;t know about each other&#39;s track.
Having Abhishek and Pankaj Tripathi in the same interview is such a joy.
That kid is sooo cute<br>Hope the movie is as good as its terrific trailer
Only for Pearly😍😍
Pearley 💕💕
The child shouldn&#39;t have been a part of this adult conversation...
Film companion is nepotism paid reviewer
The confidence and conviction of the kid makes me so insecure. ❤️🌷
Inayat rocks, AB talks, nice collage of actors👍
Spoilers alert tag needed!
Where is fathima..?
Feeling so proud pearly 😘😘😘

WTF! They started talking about the climax scene and giving out spoilers in an interview?! Don’t they know that these little moments in the scenes “during” the film is what helps create the magic!?
Kaleen bhaiya❤️❤️
I guess the interview cum conversation was funny coz it was online , in real I don&#39;t think all of these guys would have done the same ,at least not to this level!
Dont know about movie yet but anurag dada+pritam da+arijit singh = music is always last forever.
abhi baby rocks
Abhishek rocks!
all my juvenile self can think of is &quot;lodu king lodu king&quot;
Abhishek lead the way but hands down Inayat was the star🌟👍<br>Regards<br>Joy

Came here for pankaj sir ❤️
Team Lodu.
Wish Fatima was there too. She would have completed a hat trick of the hotness quotient along with Aditya and Sanya. And Abhishek alone brought the coolness quotient in the conversation. Love him!
a very fun interview. Loved it :D
Pearley chechiiii...feeling so proudddd💜🤗😘..
Abhishek should try his hand more at black comedy like Bluffmaster. I am sure he&#39;ll nail it.
Pearly mutheee 😘
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=1309">21:49</a> he called sanya fatima. What a dumbo
That lil girl is so confident! Loved her answers..
Abhishek is the embodiment of AWESOME!
Shit.  Why no spoiler warning
Pearle❤
Loooooooove you abhishek 😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😊
Anupama didi !!!
Pankaj Tripathi is easily the most overrated actor here. Made a career out of playing the same UP bhaiyya roles and banaoing chew tiyas out of people.
Abhishek bachchan❤️🔥
Pankaj tripathi ❤️❤️❤️❤️ ,let him speak People wanna hear him more
The conversation would have been lifeless without Abhishek.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX6h2yEEcM&amp;t=847">14:07</a> is when i am reminded of Ranbir&#39;s comments on how Basu&#39;s set moves on AIB. I had come here for that. Thank you for bringing it up :)
Frankly, I have never come across a &quot;bad&quot; Abhishek performance. Not a single one. He&#39;s always ranged from decent to excellent in his filmography so far. Guru being his peak both in acting as well as box office glory. People unnecessarily confuse his box office setbacks with a perceived lack of acting skills. He&#39;s a very good actor actually. Only a fool would deny that. Yuva, Guru, Sarkar, Antar Mahal, KANK, Dostana, Delhi 6, Paa, Raavan, Dum Maaro Dum, Bol Bachchan, Manmarziyaan, Breathe 2. I mean come on man, he&#39;s always been really good.

Abhishek is the king of deadpan, dry wit.

Abhishek should start his own comedy weekly. His sense of humour is so ironic and cool.
Just a comment to make you notice that Anupama&#39;s voice is back in the intro
Abhishek is the life of the conversation. A very optimistic guy always brimming with positivity. Also, he&#39;s a kewl cucumber. Never seen him fly off the handle even in the face of some of the meanest trolling. His responses to all the trolls too have always been very dignified.

Anupama has asked such amazing minute questions from so many filmmakers (actors, directors, writers, technicians, musicians etc) that one day she will take a long break and write and direct a masterpiece of her own using all this practical knowledge she has acquired by interviewing the whole film industry.
Abhishek looks like the leader of the gang 😂
Abhishek Bachchan have a great sense of humour, Amazing interview, great fun watching it.
Battukeshwar tiwari !!! 😂😂🤣
