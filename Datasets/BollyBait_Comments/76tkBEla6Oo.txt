In this era of Netflix and Kardashians, I am here binge watching these wonderful interviews. As a girl in her twenties, I feel I have so much to learn from these interviews. Simi Garewal is angelic!
So beautiful and very sexy very hot aishwarya rai bollywood actress🌹🌹
Her lips are different now
میم فیر توں چوپے😊❤

Her face was that beautiful you can&#39;t concentrate on nothing but her face I&#39;m not just saying it even in her movies u can&#39;t concentrate on nothing but ash&#39;s beauty
Aishwarya Rai is the most articulate, well poised woman ever to exist, and exudes the same amount of immeasurable beauty and grace in her manners and endeavors with the help of her very witty genes, she is well balanced equally in beauty and intellectual attributes, extremely rare feature in most women. This is why she is the most beautiful woman ever as she doesn&#39;t fake on her persona despite being the top notch Bollywood personality along with Amitabh Bachchan.
During Aishwarya&#39;s time people with different eye colors were rare.. so people in India thought she was beautiful. So the modelling and media made her famous and beautiful... I agree she is beautiful  but living in the USA she is not the most beautiful woman in the world. I have seen a lot of beautiful people in USA. Even a lot of foreigners think she is ugly. I think the media made her beautiful .  She is beautiful but not the most beautiful.. Anyone agree???
She seems plastic in terms of emotions ,very calculated
What is this hairstyle called which aish is having here?
Is sad that someone that seems perfect is called fake. Life has it perfection between good and bad. India should be proud of this woman. Aish is a beauty and has beautiful heart from all the things she has done. Represent india at miss world, inspire others with her art as an actress.
Does anyone know where her sari is from?
If she was a little less poised she&#39;d be perfect
She wanted someone sensitive who would respect her then went and dated Salman
Pulchritudinous!
She is Graceful and intelligent ❤

Simmi Grewal has a soothing voice .....it&#39;s like therapy for us ❤. Also she is a punjabi girl ❤️❤️❤️ and i love punjabi people
Who&#39;s Inder (the model she&#39;s talking about)
Beauty aside, this interview feels cringe
Most beautiful girl india has ever seen🥺🥺❤️❤️
She loved Salman somewhere hence took his name
Simi was the best interviewer before Karan Johar stole her concept 🥴🥴
Hai.mam.🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷🪷

❤😊
It&#39;s so grounding to listen to young Aishwarya! 🖤 In the past 10 years, I&#39;ve probably watched this interview at least 4 times! She had such a wonderful personality and, 10 years ago, I learned so much from her in this interview, about how to approach life, etc. She&#39;s sensible, intelligent and sensitive, I really like that about her.<br><br>I have to admit, though, I&#39;ve watched a ton of interviews with Indian actors and actresses, and one thing I&#39;ve observed is that they were more interesting when they were younger. The older they get, the more they adapt to a toxic environment and become less authentic. It&#39;s sad to say, but they get worse with time. Today&#39;s Aishwarya, for me, is someone who shuts her eyes to the injustices of fasc*st India and I don&#39;t appreciate that at all. It&#39;s evil, pure evil, but she&#39;s not the only celebrity who does this. So, it&#39;s now sort of bittersweet to watch these interviews, you can&#39;t forget their role in today&#39;s contemporary India, unfortunately. But young Aishwarya was gorgeous!
Even in that area Aishwarya was overacting
yellamma🎉❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1495">24:55</a> english accent from Miss World reign.
I am so lost in her hazel eyes that i can&#39;t focus on what she is even saying 😂😂😂
Beauty+ Brain+ telent= Aishwarya 💎💎💎💎
you&#39;re young and naive
We all indian love Aishwarya Rai today and we will love her tomorrow to. She will be in our heart forever and ever.  The more time will pass she will be iconic ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Epitome of Beauty is Aishwarya Rai. I wonder how it feels like to sit in front of The Aishwarya Rai! I mean How Simi?❤ Simi you are the Best
When she talks she reminds me of Rekha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1300">21:40</a>  She was lost so much in love with this guy that her heart pounded so hard before taking his name.....and then balanced with diplomatically other names.
Girls woman wanted to be like her, guys man wanted to merry  someone like her
I feel she puts in a lot of effort to  speak with an accent; in the present times you see her with a lot of make up to hide her growing age.
Aishwarya is so perfectly created by God. She is the perfect example of beauty with brains 💕 she looks divine, so elegant 💓 just love her. ❣️
Calmness while talking ❤❤
Beauty without  brain  :- in aish case am wrong!!! ❤
The introduction is hilarious! As a non-Indian I think i can be objective here. 🙄AR is a very (outwardly) beautiful, but rather conceited woman. The contrived modesty is too much... She is a good actress, great dancer and fantastic ambassador for India. But other than that I find her quite irritating. Always talking as if she&#39;s so wise, as if everything she says is so profound, and as if the whole world revolves around the film industry (and how she was literally invited into the industry blah blah). I like Simi though, despite the weird intro... 😅😅😅 Just wish she, and other, moderators would be a bit less gushy, falling over themselves etc. It&#39;s embarrassing...
Damn that theme song
I look like aishwarya rai
She was so girly in her youth. She definitely matured into a formidable media-savvy woman.
Her face is an art.. ❤
Hemaji is much more beautiful  than ash
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=306">5:06</a> so apt!!
Aishwarya Wala

Aish is beautiful in &amp; outside <br>She’s trying tobe herself <br><br>😘🤗💕🧘‍♀️🧘‍♀️🧘‍♀️
Who is inder she is talking about?
Anyone watching in 2023?
Very good platform where we know about different kind of  Personalities what they think,what their visions,which kind of personalities they are,their attitudes, behaviors,how they are with other people...<br>Good Looks, with Down to Earth Graceful Personality with kind heart example of Aishwarya Rai Amazing...<br>We can feel positive vibes...<br>The way of talking nice...<br>Good Personalities Should  Always Apriciated....
Just watched interview of PS2 in hungama nd trisha and all others were talking about how gracefully she is with correct posture nd all positive talking... its still same even, decades have gone but she hs been still the same aish ❤<br>....... she is beauty with brain❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That aish....and this aish....zameen asman ka farq...this is the life...kal asman par...aj zameen par

Fake is at best iski beti bhi yedi iski Tarah

Simi is so classy and graceful. These social media loser influencers should learn from the best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1345">22:25</a>

Iam not able to listen to her speak.. Just enjoying her eye😂😂
She has a permanent filter fixed with her face

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=305">5:05</a> these interviews are very intellectual.
I really admired her beauty &amp; her humility, she&#39;s one of a kind.
Why does this English sound so charming and beautiful compared to the English they speak now ??!?!
This show was so much ahead of its time. This whole interview kept me smiling throughout...
first time in life , I m getting distracted by her eye &amp; its lids
Who&#39;s watching in 2023? 😆😆
Anyone watching this in 2023?😀

Real hair of aish
Her eyes r realy beautiful amoung indian people its like once in a blue moon
Very grace taking ishwarya rai
Who is here in 2023?
She&#39;s quite similar to Manisha Koirala
Cannot help but draw comparisons with the interviews of the actresses today.<br>The poise, the calmness, the elegance, the grace...they&#39;ve all vanished into thin air.<br>All of these new actresses come across as over enthusiastic for no apparent reason.The way they speak is also so banal, so hackneyed.Their vocabulary doesn&#39;t happen to have the beautiful and loquacious words that we get to hear in older interviews.
Now I know why salman is still single🖤
Not the pin
True
This show should be name dignity and grace class....... <br>what an epitome!!!!!!!!<br>Simi Garewal is so classy..... so so so much humility....
She speaks like Rekha ...much similarities in the way they talk
People talking about Aishwarya Rai acting skills are the very funny things that I see in this comment section. The kind of acting you see in Bollywood nowadays are the biggest jokes ever. The fallout of Bollywood right now. Not to say she is extremely great in acting but she is a good actress anyways and who has good acting skills. She is generally a witty and extremely intelligent person.
Beauty I desire ❤️😘🥰💐🥳🎉💐🙏🎉🎉🥳💐💐🥰❤️😘
I cant even hear them they are not talking they are whispering and even with that they have very strong Indian British accent which is so annoying
Only priety jinta and Rani Mukerji interview was found original
Scorpion women always stand out in crowd ! Compassion they carry! Don&#39;t know i never found her plastic 🦉
She is Normal only
What a beauty, grace, charm, poise
The most beautiful woman is so humble.
Both are my favorite whom to praise
Sensible and beautiful Aishwarya 😍
She was so young when started her acting career. However she&#39;s one of the brightest coolest most vivacious tenacious and lovely smartest most beautiful gorgeous actress . Happy to see her smiling and living her life to the fullest.  Take care and be safe and have fun aish babes. Love and light to you.
ലോകം കണ്ട ഏറ്റവും ഷേപ് ഉള്ള സൗന്ദര്യം ഉള്ള മുഖം 🥰🥰🥰
Two beautiful and brilliant people
I can’t take my eyes off Aishwarya Her Eyesssssss ❤
Over acting ki dukan
Her eyes 😍
I like aishwaryas beauty bt her fake laughs  in every minute and dramatic expressions to look beautiful/elegant.............doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br>please somebody tell her- SImplicity is beauty
i thought beautiful women might be conceited about their beauty, but women like Aishwarya Rai proved that&#39;s it was wrong.
Simi is the Best! 💕
Who is hear from 2022
APNO SE ACCHE GAIRA  SE ACCHHE  DHEDA
Iyyoooo iyoooo. Alzkuu alzku aiswariya..

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1360">22:40</a> which model she meant there ?
long back we had already our indian aesthetic and that was truly Aishwarya Rai 🤍🌿
who are here to see this delightful interview in 2022?😂 and whatever Aishwarya says it&#39;s so beautiful to hear.. and she is an aesthetic in herself.
Her beauty is mesmerizing.
I do t find her attractive at all
She represents us 🇮🇳
This is what we call interview real jenuin...aaj kal ke interview  acting lagte hai full of fake accent and attitude
Just look at her expression when she said What are the things you&#39;re passionate about... One can understand how she manages to be perfect in every task she does through that answer.
My English teacher suggested me this show😍. I am totally in love  with this channel. Thanks to my English teacher 😂💯<br>Even Aishwarya is her favourite actress as well😅😍
Simmi garewal was awesome in SHIDHARTHA nude boobs
When u r watching this to learn English
GREETINGS.......................😀
Aishwarya Rai is a classic beauty with a beautiful reserved and guarded personality. That really shows her good upbringing and how well cultured she is ❤️. Not like Sushmita Sen the big mouth who always does selfpraises and keeps bragging about it everytime. Sushmita is a very cunning and arrogant lady.
Aishwarya is a lady with beauty and intelligence.Simi Garewal is amazing
She is so elegant 🤩. And look at her makeup , so beautiful.
Didn&#39;t people in the industry say shes difficult to work with?
Salman Khan ❤️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1346">22:26</a> sexy man
She&#39;s very smart. That definitely adds to her beauty.

Very nice friend
Aishwarya is a beauty personified
Simi💕

Such an intelligent, well-educated, refined and sophisticated woman
I adore how elegant, graceful, classy, articulate and soft-spoken she is
from Nawab Chaudhary707🌹❤🌹❤🌹❤🌹Love is Life
She is rare woman.. Very precious thing happened to India.. She is the reason we watch bollywood
Simi always just appreciate the beauty and richness even if the person in front of her counter it
Aishwarya Rai has superb beauty.
Her acting in ham dil de chuke sanam is equal to the whole career of some actresses.she is one of the most beautiful woman of the world but she is also one of the greatest actress of all time.she is one in the trillions.
In 2022🙂🙃
Na karaatihootum tu nice smayalmeinbooreetulagtihoo
Aishwarya isnt fake, she just protects herself
I&#39;m not liking Simi&#39;s opening questions. But Aishwarya always handles herself intelligently not matter how insensitive the questions are. David Letterman also tried to belittle her, and she was excellent with her responses.
She is beauty with brains. Very smart and intelligent.
Somehow I found Aishwarya had fixed her teeth ,  you may figure it out if you look closer to her teeth.
Aishwarya jaise koi nhi hai is duniya me💝
I am lucky that at 34 I didn&#39;t s compromise to have just successful men as husband. I waited and found at least, an honest, sensitive, religious and at the same time from good education background with good job. It&#39;s rare. So I didn&#39;t go on look. He is normal looking person.☺
She is true Indian beauty like people want fair skin glass skin see bruh  she is not that fair in complexion she is brown girl but she is still one of the most attractive and most beautiful girl I have ever seen mann I could die to be like her ...like if I would have been a guy I would have easily fall for her
And at this point of her life she was actually dating Salman Khan , behind the scenes
O jana
V nice u r eyes ...and smile....aish
Such fake laughter, she is soo.....fake!!!!!
Beautiful Times when stupid talk shows like koffee with karan didn&#39;t exist 😁
Aishwarya is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful women in the world. She is intelligent, dignified and level headed - and also extremely guarded and cautious with her answers. I think it’s a combination of these traits that people interpret as being fake or plastic. I don’t believe she is fake, this is just who she is. She is not comfortable sharing too much of her emotions and inner feelings with the entire world and that is okay.
OMG those eyes 😍😍😍
I can’t really enjoy aishwarya’s interviews as she’s very secretive and diplomatic. So I am unable to like her personality but people have no right to call her fake or plastic cuz of that. She’s a human being with her limitations and we should understand that. Her laugh is her defensive mechanism I believe and people shouldn’t shame her for it
It&#39;s rare to find such grace and elegance in anyone with a subtle mix of rawness. I love this interview to bits and pieces. Thank you Simi ji for these soft-spoken, charming interviews. Sadly, nowadays no one does interviews like this.
Nice
This is really a true definition of beauty. I don&#39;t think the definition remained same after Ash as the world is creating more plastic faces now.
Those were the times when interviews were so decent. The journalits, anchors were so simple yet decent. Not like today&#39;s KKK where some dumbass brats open their mouth just to bark nonsense and insult other struggling actors
Most of the answers from Aish is fake and manipulated... She is getting hesitant to speak her heart out even thou simi is trying her best...
She always claims that she had no intentions to join the showbiz industry until her professor approached for a magazine shoot, then how come she appeared in a pencil ad in her childhood?
her voice is so beautiful
For those who call her plastic <br><br>Why People are are so jealous of her!! All the haters just envy her!! That’s the only answer to the hatred towards Aishwarya’s beauty!!<br><br>She is mesmerizing!! Not plastic!
During my childhood days, I used to read Amar Chitra Kathas. Aishwarya reminds me of a beautiful Apsara who has come alive out of a comic book.  She is so beautiful.
Respect mam
Lips of aiawriya rai is very ugly
Beautiful way of speaking. But I guess when in india🤗speak indian. British has left us. It&#39;s a second language . Stick to the roots as they do
Girls at that time..were soo elegant and classic
Have to admit that all the Bachhan&#39;s including Aishwarya Rai Bachhan are so good at english vocab 🥰
2021 🤗🌸
She is so humble! Wow! Now that&#39;s a rare quality in celebrities.😍
The fact that she gets so much hate just proves that she is the besy. Her beauty is otherworldly and that’s why people are so jealous of her. But she has fans like us who love her too.
Back then people used to speak like it were for asmr videos. Or did people just get louder? Idk
Her fluency 😍
That annoying laugh of aishwarya rai ....<br>I must appreciate simi&#39;s elegance 👍
*How can one be this beautiful*?
Kuch na kaho kuch bhi na suno kya kahna hai kya Sunana hai samay ka yeh pal Tham sa gaya hai bas 1 tum ho only you worlds most beautiful ..... aishwarya ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Aishwarya ma&#39;am is so beautiful, calm and composed, talented.
Salman

It is one of the Finest interview of ARB I have encountered till yet..so calming , just beautiful , far away from from TRP titles. <br>Today&#39;s Host&#39;s must learn the essence and grace of how to conduct and take ahead a delightful conversation from Madam Garewal. <br>I appreciate.
Uff she is very beautiful 😘😘
Anyone watching in 2021? ❤❤
She is the classic example of beauty with no personality. I wish she was more candid and not rehearsed.
VOLUME   V  V   LOW
Aishwarya Rai is one of the most beautiful creations of nature ...
Ash is born to be a queen

Wow....what a beautiful face aishwarya have😍🤩
Those eyes😢
Simi is an amazing interviewer. She understands her guests deeply and asks the right questions.
All of these people are SEARCHING for an imperfection or a reason to see her as not “ the most beautiful woman in the world”. Stop taking life and titles so seriously. What’s the point of trying to tarnish something so unserious that was just made up for entertainment and marketing and maybe to make someone feel good? Sure there’s many beautiful women in the world who could be associated with those words but hey luck of the draw it was Aishwarya. What if it was you? Are you  supposed to suffer and make yourself  small and convince everyone that your actually not pretty? How petty does that sound? The very people who try to point out flaws and call her ugly are the same people who would expect everyone to be happy for them if they were her. (Which they all secretly wish they were) stop making excuses to try and justify your spitefulness and jealousy. If something is for you it will be! We all have a special purpose and just because you too are an extremely beautiful woman does not mean that your purpose was to be crowned with this title and acknowledged as so. Maybe that purpose was meant for a different beautiful woman whose imperfect physically flawed and who many may actually regard as being less beautiful than someone else they know. ITS NOT THAT SERIOUS :). Let people have whatever it is that is happening for them. Be happy for them, relate to them as if you ARE them! Once you get that, you’ll realize that there’s no reason to be jealous.. . . NEVER! Find your purpose. Let it find you! That’s where happiness is! I see a woman whose extremely well spoken, intelligent and possibly a harder worker than many. . . Is that not beautiful? Beauty depends on whose beholding. Even your most favorite colors in someone else’s eyes could never be enough to sustain a spark. Looks change quite a bit once you get to know someone. Trust in your own ability to shine from the inside out. When you do, they will too.
Aishwarya is perfection and so divine ❤<br>Perfect woman<br>Her voice is pure feminine<br>Her expressions through eyes and her face says a lot without saying a word ❤ i just adore her beauty
Aish is a princess with star eyes
Forget her face, the poise and grace with which she talks and carries is amazing..her voice is angelic ..you can also tell she&#39;s very well educated and has tints of humour<br>Man!! This woman is perfect,u can see why she was crowned Miss World
Rani Mukherjee is beautiful 😍
I don&#39;t think she is the most beautiful woman in the world  she is beautiful but she is not the most beautiful woman  look at Laura Datta she is beautiful 💖also  Madhuri 💖❤
So sweetly she took the name of Salman ..
Nowadays very rare to find these kind of shuttle interview !! Kudos to the interviewer
Beautiful and talented.
Some how no doubt ash is toobeautiful but her interviews doesn&#39;t hold me to chair....where as sushmitas voice my god...it&#39;s plutonic...heavenly mesmerizing..u just keep on listing ...and u feel so soon it&#39;s over....may god bless Sush with all the happiness which elevates her....
Wow Man !!!! How beautiful is she 🤗 !!!! Aishwarya Ma&#39;am is still the most graceful actress in bollywood. Bollywood will NVR get another Aishwarya 😊 !!!
So pretty and very innocent and truly good answers. I don&#39;t understand why some people think she is fake.<br>She was a strong woman in 1999 the interview took place. Looking now she is<br>Strong a beautiful actress and so confident and a good mom career and still after all these years she is gorgeous no doubt at all.<br>Married a strong and powerful family not easy but she is doing a good job❤❤🙏🙏
I sometimes get bored with Aishwarya always polished and always perfect behavior  never having a personality duhhhh 🤧
My lady love.... The Classic Lady- Aishwarya 🥰
Her beauty is irreplaceable ❤️
But who is Inderrrr?
Outstanding Interview Mam
Mesmerizing Memories
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1371">22:51</a> By Inder did she mean Inder Kumar?
All time I was just looking at her eyes and think how can her eyes could be that pretty I wish I also had like her she&#39;s so beautiful ❤️
Yr beauty ki bt horhi.. Itni bhi khas ni h..
U r gods gift to India. Most gorgeous woman in the world
Here ashwairya is looking like Himanshi khurana..!❤️
Ash ❤️
Her way of talking is more captivating than her eyes...the way she talks can drive anyone crazy...😍😍😍😍😍😍
Her beauty have no words 😶 evergreen most beautiful
She s so beautiful and intelligent!
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1349">22:29</a>- “The physical”, followed by an innuendo; quite conspicuous what she’s referring to, if you get my drift. xD
At that point of time, she really likes salman khan. However, the qualities she stated she wants in a life partner absolutely echoes with that of Junior Bachchan and definitely NOT salman khan. She found her perfect partner.
Her eyes are so <a href="http://beautiful.beauty/">beautiful.beauty</a> with beautiful eyes
So beautiful
Wt a beauty.. India proud
Lock down surely have such a profound effect I did not think that in 2021 i would be watching rendezvous..🙄
Anyone  watching 2021😊
She is living Barbi girl ❤️
Angel 😇 from the heaven.
It is June 1, 2021. I am born in Alberta, Canada. My parents are from Kerala, India. I love watching this interview in 1999. She is humble, beautiful, articulate and kind hearted in this interview. Thank you for this interview.
How beautiful she is 😍
the eloquent English
I see dark circles?
Y the hell she married Abhishek 😭😭😭 he even dnt know how to behave in front of cameras
Both of them speak fluent English. They are poised,educated and gorgeous too.
Please Simi can you invite the Bollywood actress &quot;Shilpa Shetty&quot;. She is amazing. I saw her in England, UK back in 2005/2006. She is very beautiful.
I&#39;m astonished by Aishwarya. She&#39;s a really beautiful human, inside and out. I can see in her words, voice, and eyes how genuine she is. A good, caring, very intelligent woman. I&#39;m in love with her whole personality after watching this. I had only seen her in Kajrare and Salaam, so I only knew how beautiful and amazing an actress and dancer she was. She&#39;s so special, in all ways possible.
I am really liking her locket and earrings set!
Ash  you are looking  beautiful  but  thought you have tried a side parting  it seems you dont get a side parting easily as  you are used to middle parting hairstyles which are much natural  easier to make and beautiful
Ash is looking  gorgeous  but ash you look good with your natural  middle parting  hairstyle
She is looking absolutely stunning   she has tried some new style with a side parting but middle parting  suits her best and also she doesn&#39;t  get a perfect side parting  of course ash has a natural  middle  parting  which just parts naturally  for her and it suits her the and she looks really beautiful
Gorgeous 😍😍
Aiswarya Rai you are getting beautiful more and more, year by year. You are the godess
No plastic surgery real beauty queen
In my opinion both that thing is like chocolate milk and cookies ash mem you are looking very very beautiful keep it up mem
Now I realised why my uncle is fan of her....<br>Extreme beauty with talent
Simi Can you call again Ashwarya along with hubby Abhishek on the interview,  ........ People would like to know their chemistry after 40 !!
EIGHT WONDER OF THE WORLD AISHWARYA RAI  😍💕💖❤💜💙💚💘✨
I think she&#39;s not pretty
She is most beautiful face I ever seen ♥️♥️🥰
Her face is so disturbing in this interview I couldn&#39;t focus 😂
inspiring
kajol is soooo real!!!
Kajol is the best!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful ladies 😊
Those eyes❤️
Beauty definition starts from her
She meant to be beautiful
Kitni Sundar LG rhi h Aishwarya ❤️❤️
Yep crab mindset Truely sucks👌She knew wht she want in Man to be Her Husband 👍
Aishwarya is very beautiful woman with brain ❤
Goddess 🥰🥰🥰
Love the vulnerable, candid and forthcoming Aishwarya here. You never see her like this after the Salman fiasco happened. Loved it when she said, &quot;I hate being called fake.&quot; You go girl! &lt;3&lt;3
I&#39;ve always appreciated aishwarya for her beauty and amazing grace since her miss world days. I never thought she is plastic. I always knew she will be successful and still is so beautiful.  An interesting side note on this interview- she mentions she wanted to study and finish her education to be a good role model for her future kids, and also points out salman khan on her list of sexy and gorgeous men.<br> Back in the day he was, till his list of crimes kept increasing.
Did she say Salman is the most sexy guy..why no gossip channels picked it up.. I was shocked.. Anyways being a fellow bunt Aishwarya has been iconic.. To convey a woman is beautiful we just say she looks like Aishwarya Rai.. N i just love her the way she has conducted herself over the years.. As a daughter, dauther inlaw wife mom she is amazing..
Isase kahi jyada khoobsurat ladkiya hai panjab rajsthan simla Kashmir nanital all over India
wat a beauty
Milind, arjun, Indar and Salman 😍😍😍😍
Who knew that a Good vocabulary and a very polite behavior actually makes you pretty charming? I guess we all did know before
i initially used to think that simi garewal jee was from a royal family .. 😂 she is so graceful.
I am binge watching Rendezvous because of Simi Garwell. She is a woman of grace and empathy!
hhh and she said salman omg
I would like to become like aishwarya rai interms of being so cool and so perfect
What a terrible accent yaar..
Ram ji ram jai shree krishna
2021
shes so beautiful but i wonder if thats her real eye color?
No words for her Beauty
Heavenly beauty,Aishwarya Rai.....my all time fav,I adore her so much
M watching this in 2021...just finished sushmita&#39;s interview too... N now i can understand why Sushmita was the winner in miss india contest...Aish is beautiful but Sush is a complete package of beauty with brain...even the way she laughs n smiles....wow
Anybody here at 2021 guys !? 😍
Just look at her mann😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩
Aish is so damn beautiful and glamorous..
Heart angel.mind god.
Tamsundh khandar khush kurmuth sex.
Of time.
I abhor people who call such a polite and beautiful person through- and- through fake.
Such a lovely interview and aish is so damn intelligent yet always graceful and smart. She is answering every question so perfectly. ❤️
Anyone in 2021
She is too gorgeous.. Very talented.. She is a complete beauty with brain.

They sound oh so “terribly posh” don’t they 😂
2021
But when I see her in the peagent she looks arrogant and overconfident.
Aishwarya Roy&#39;s eyes should be named as 9th wonder of world❤🤩
Aish is not only world&#39;s beautiful but also smart &amp; hardworking person
Fake plastic women 😂😂
Beauty with brain aishwarya ❤

Watching just after Susmita&#39;s interview... So much overacting
Still in 2021 that we are watching this...right?
Beautiful
most beautiful women in the world
She was speaking like a native speaker........
OMG....what a beauty!!......she is really a wonder👌👌
Who r watching in 2021??🤓🤓
Simi Garewal Mam puts her questions so gracefully that sometimes eyes remain glued to her irrespective of the celebs invited.
Simi your just amazing host I didn&#39;t see a wonderful host like you please come back with another wonderful show we are eagerly waiting for you simi
I cant take my eyes off her eyes
Such a lucky guy to marry her
She is honestly the most beautiful woman to have lived and living now
Anyone watching in 2021🙋‍♀️
This interview makes sense more than ever in the year 2021.. Ash has been ahead of her times. Always and forever. Thank you for being you. Simi ji you are simply amazing!
Let the reality be clarified.
Three please.......
Exellent eye expression.
The Wonder Queen 👑.
so Jaya aunty/Aishwarya herself doesnt mind Simi calling her Ash?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1346">22:26</a> First time I saw her taking his name. If they had married I cannot even imagine how good their child would have looked.
I love the 1999 aesthetic
INDIA is lucky Bollywood is LUCKY bachan family is LUCKY to have a world&#39;s beautifull👑 legendry 👑woman 👑
2021
Aish is most beautiful lady ever
She is not gorgeous if she see the Arabian girls she Will shocked to see their natural beauty
ഐശ്വര്യറായ്
She is like  pari.
How  beautiful  she is.her lips her  eyes. Her height .
normal makeup...its like normal girl ..but nowadays its so artificial makeup...her hair looks rough and light but now its totally different
she Was very good That Time
2 women conversing without any malice is the real dream. Somehow, I felt Simi was very agreeable with Aishwarya while giving a real tough time to Sushmita. Her eyes and firing questions were really judging. I guess everyone questions a strong, unique woman.
Anyone on 4/1/2020
U r very beautiful mam..💕💕💕
Aishwarya your so beautiful .. Such a brilliant way.. May God bless.. Wonderful speech... 🌹
simi please mujhe aishwarya se milwa do.....please please please
tere chehre se nazar nhi hatati teri baat hum kya sune
who is watching  after 22 december 2020 plz hit like. oh you are so cute aishwarya from somalia🇸🇴
Everyone is talking about how pretty Aishwarya is but can we appreciate Simi &#39;s elegant beauty !! Her elegance is truly mesmerizing
Simi Garewal is so cultured elegant sophiistaced in front of her Ash becomes dumb
I really can&#39;t understand what she is saying,... Every sentence changes with different opinion not clear in thought as well even her speech pronunciation , we can&#39;t  understand...
Look at her 😍😍 she was the miss world! See her simplicity.. Dats what makes her more beautiful and make her loved by all ❤️🌟
She is beautiful...inside and out....period....people should just learn to deal with it
SHE WAS NOT FAIR AT THAT BUT NOW IS SOO WHITE I THINK SHE HAD DONE SOME WHITENING TREATMENT
Her beauty is unique. Very much different from her parents looks
She called Aishwarya unreal and Aishwarya immediately stated that she detests being called fake<br>Aww , We all love Aishwarya , no need to prove.
Who is this indhar from modeling field
She carried beauty with character.<br>I dont know and cant compare anyone with her interms of beauty for her.. she is so much blessed 🤩
I find her fake
Keep shining Aishwarya...lots of love...
Makup ka kamal ha g
2020 anyone ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1300">21:40</a> watch and go😁give a like
Inspiring😊❤️
Watching it in slow motion conversation is so cool and seductive ☺️
Graceful!
Simi garewal show is so classy
Now when aradhya will say I don&#39;t want to study she needs an answer 😂 ...and yes she is married to an actor 😍
OMG Aish  said Salman Khan is the sexiest man when she was secretly dating him at this point! so cheeky :)
How beautiful aish 😍🤗😇❤💞💨🖤💃
GOD YOU ARE GREAT; )
I dint think she is really happy in that Bachan house .. coz of all these Salman Khan and other Khan idiotic pressure she had to settle in Bachan family for her respect! I really wish she finds someone and live rest of her life happy atlst ..
Why is the volume so low?
Very  nice pigure
These beautiful women are of no use to society
I loveeeee you sooooooooooo much
Love her
Anyone watching from 2021?
She has the cutest giggle.
SHE IS AMAZING
Man...she is a stunner. And how. It&#39;s not like doing a comparison or anything. Beauty comes in countless forms. But Aishwarya has been bestowed (whether a boon or a bane is to be assessed as it may, from moment to moment) with some extraordinary looks even amongst those lined up as beautiful. It&#39;s outstanding. I like her grace. She tries very hard to stay well mannered and thoughtful. That shows how conscious and aware she is.
Aish is damn damn adorable... The most beautiful woman on earth 😘💞💞
Nice 🙏🙏🗡️👌🗡️
Beautiful    aishwarya
Watching it during lockdown...Ash is World most beautiful ✨👌 known Women ...🙂
No 1 beuty of the world😘😘😘😍😍😍 salman b
Very good moment. Most  beautiful amazing n pleasant looks Aishwarya jee. Simi Garewal is also renowned n beautiful anchor. Very good discussion. All the best 2 both of u. Thanks.
So fake 🙄
Fabulous questions and exquisite answers❤️
I just staring at her through whole interview. She is really beauty with brains
those interviews are way too intelligent then from now on 2020 back 20 years ... know days gay daddy karan johar ji really sucks. upss .ahhhhh 🙃
She wanted to study.. despite of having film offers at hand.. she is a brainiac ♡♡♡
She still looks the same .
This Women Inspires So many of Us <br>So much of Love and Respect of you Aishwarya ❤
Aishwarya rai is  beautiful
Why she always wear white🤔
This is no plastic but a beautiful face and also good heart and mind
My eyes is also like aishwarya......😌.....
I was looking for this thx do you have a classic interview with Sanjay or Reka?
She is beautiful but boring
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1346">22:26</a> best part of the interview
Only the fans of Khans hate her as she didn&#39;t tolerate the criminal Khan to be married.
Her mother was more beautiful than her....d only thing was she didn&#39;t get much recognition as simple as that...
She&#39;s beautiful and I always instantly hit to watch her interviews only to quit halfway thru. <br>Reason being, for some weird reasons her talks or speech or her wavy tone has never been identifiable/relatable and makes you lose interest. <br>And she should have received this as a feedback long before that she needs to cut her statements and make them short and rounded. Coz we kind of understand her point even before she finishes speaking. That&#39;s why it seems all fake or deliberate to sound intelligent. On the contrary, she IS quite a mind. <br>She never looks to me &quot;in the moment&quot;. Its almost like her mind is occupied designing responses verbally and non verbally and hence looks very restricted.<br><br>Love her a lot but felt like sayin it out here today.
Aishwarya is the epitome of a swan goddess  🦢
Amazing
Most beautiful women on earth never will born like this beauty any other your are special gift by god
Ash sounds like a barbie doll😍
How beautiful she is.... Her eyes wow
Always very beautiful! But she speaks like a 50 year old woman.
Very Beautiful Woman in the world🤗luv u ash❤
2020
Wait,this interview was in 1999 and she is not with Salman yet? Something doesnt add up here?Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam had already been shot in the previous year?what do you say?
she beauty with mind but allia sonam or others
Charm
People don&#39;t keep saying she is fake beauty n plastic surgery blabla.. Then anyone can bcom miss world.. If u find anything beautiful n brilliant accept it and appreciate it.. Don&#39;t spread hatred n jealous
A beautiful extraordinary soul like Aishwarya will only born again once in a century
Both of them speaking<br>Me continuously looking into Aishwarya&#39;s eye 🥺 like a creep
30 July 2o2o
Simi ask who sexiest handsome man?<br>Aish Salman Khan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1342">22:22</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23aishwaryarai">#aishwaryarai</a> conducts herself with such dignity &amp; grace. She&#39;s a slap to fake nautankis like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sonamkapoor">#sonamkapoor</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kareenakapoor">#kareenakapoor</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23aliaabhatt">#aliaabhatt</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23aishwaryarai">#aishwaryarai</a> is a great example of the importance of having grounded parents who are sanskaari kapoors &amp; khans lack sanskaar &amp; a good grounding.
Miss the times when decency was more prized than sensationalism, when humans behaved like humans, not drunk monkeys. Let&#39;s reclaim decency &amp; civility in our discourse. This is who we are as people, this is the real us. Please stop the being  intoxicated by sensationalism.
Haha the whole interview i was not concentrating on what she is saying, i was just looking at her expressive face. Really she is god gifted
India ki no.1 beauty  with brain and multytalented.......
She is an inspiration... In every sense to all indian women...!!!
Aish is definitely the most beautiful woman in the world
She is the only one who represents India very well way 🌈👏😊
Aish sound so fake . Not an essence of naturality.  Its  seems the sudden fame has gone too loaded into her head.  Hence her artificial projection in just overwhelming..<br><br>   u should see the beauty of maduri dixit in her prime and how well maduri she speaks  with simplicity
Golden beauty forever
Wow such a real beauty...people say she has done plastic surgery...how insensitive people....cant u see her real beauty?
Aish you are most beautiful lady ..Your grace ..Way of speaking everything is marval
July 2020?
Everything is okay except the way she laughs. When I hear simi and when I compare it with Aish is totally diff ! The diff in maturity I guess! Ash laughs. After every sentence like a child!
Beauty with a balanced mindset. Successful yet so humble. Truly inspiring.
By ThE GrACe oF GOD this interview happened. I have never seen Aishwarya talk about her plans on her education and her choices frankly. Because the comment section is raving about salman, such a shame that she had to go through that and yet is getting brunt of it. IMO that saga changed Aishwarya, I mean looking at her in this interview and being asked such sensible and uncanny questions which were delivered so beautifully by Simi ji and Aishwarya was equally engaging. I&#39;m just miffed she can&#39;t be this way now. Maybe that&#39;s the conditioning of life and experiences. This is the 4-5 episode I&#39;m watching after Jayalalithaa, Benazir Bhutto, Ratan Tata, H. H Rajmata Gayatri Devi, Sushmita and Reneé. I see one pattern that these individuals took what came their way and hitting the ball rolling!! Simi ji is the symbol of preserverence, in the sense of media and talk shows. Nothing can match her.
Abishek is very lucky!
I&#39;ve never seen anyone so amazingly beautiful, intelligent and articulate like Aishwarya. She stuns me every time. I&#39;m so in love with her 😍😍😍
Where are the subtitles??????
Ash is very beautiful I can&#39;t take my eyes off her.
The most genuine and humble person I ever seen in Bollywood
Ash is forever my fave! ❤ such a beauty!
She is the prettiest
How old is she in this interview?
She found Salman very charming hmmm lol 😂
Namaste MDM.🙏..Simi darling has a perfect  soul 💖.......Simi MDM you are pretty woman.... I am learning a lot from your interview like listing, asking, giving respect to others... Totally the way of your behavior with other person... Being Literature Student....you are the my Soul teacher.... Every day I am watching you....and even I am changing with positive vibes....how can I express MDM....just I love you....💖
Aish is gorgeous
Simi sees right through her and is totally not buying it. Its hilarious
Hard to find a most suitable word in dictionary to describe her &quot;Beauty&quot;. <br>GOD save this world from corona virus.
My all time favorite ash still now(2020)
2020 and I still like this show 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I LOVE YOU
They are actresses not today no body can be like them
On a Simi Garewal run during this quarantine
She is a queen because she gave some average performances in movies and became rich herself? I don&#39;t get it. Why people think only actors struggle and work hard? Other than them everyone has a genie?
Simi is so brilliant n fluent OMG 😍
She is best
The intro song looks like a meme...a beautiful meme😅😍<br><br>..nd thank you cameraman for zooming aish...i got lost in her eyes...nd dont find me😍😍
Aishwarya rai always looking very cute
Dil-lagi mujko kahe mujz se dil-lagi karle Teri khashbu ki kasam meri kasak roie hae
She should be from another world. I simply don’t understand why people judge her. India should be more proud of her 😍🥰
Simi mam please come back with this show
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1344">22:24</a> she admitted Salman Khan is the sexiest man
Is there any actress who is more intelligent than Aishwarya Rai?
Anyone watching in April 2020 ?
Anyone watching in lockdown
My fav heroin...❤<br># Miss world
I am more beautiful then her🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😌😌😌😌
I LOVE YOU
Beauty with brain
Ash is of faintish colour.she is not originally FAIR.
My god , Aishwarya you have such crystal clear approach to your answers &amp; everything that has happened in your life. Brains With Beauty is better suited to u!
Am I the only one who thinks Aish&#39;s smile is so fake herr???anyway no doubt she is gorgeous and talented...
About life partner she actually described about Abhishek... And she got such a caring husband . Nice. Ur eye&#39;s, lipes, face all is beautiful Aish. Love u.😍😍
❤❤❤
There is something humbling, reserved, mysterious and classy about her that I want to be her friend haha. I don’t see arrogance at all. Maybe she had to develop a defence mechanism early on due to the harshness from people around. Jealousy often follows when you have this kind of beauty and abilities. You can see here though that she seems very intelligent, free and positive. She seems like someone you can have a substantial conversation with and trust.<br><br>MashAllah also the flawless beauty but not entitled about it. Love it
Her eyes 😍😍😍😍
Aish😍😍
Charming Lady with a beautiful heart Aishwaria Rai.
Where did Aish got her cat eyes? Parents, brother have normal eyes.
I watched whole video just to listen salman Khan&#39;s name from aishwarya...
She is pure beautiful without any plastic surgery... very appreciable ❤
This is how you invest your quarantine time...
Great Most Beautiful Women💖💚
@simmigarewalofficial Can you please uplaod the episodes tbat are never uploaded yet? It woudl be great to catch up on this quarantine time 😊

Aish is from my native Also we speak the same language..However ,I like Sushmita Sen more,Sush was 18 when she won miss Universe and aish was 22..Aish was already well  known face at that time and everyone knew Aish only will win Miss India pageant..But this 18 yr Sushmita was much more intelligent and graceful than Aisha.. Guys out there remember believing oneself is more important than being beautiful.
Loved the way she took the name of Salman Khan, Salman.
So beautiful ash
She was speaking so sensible and up to the point I think now she doesn&#39;t speak so humbly now she is loud . No doubt she is gorgeous
Ash - u r most beautiful and gorgeous women on this planet,but ur marriage...!
She looks best when she dresses simply. She should embrace this &#39;natural&#39; look. She was equally gorgeous in Jodha Akbar and that was an almost no make-up look.
&quot;I perceive myself as a working professional&quot;- she&#39;s not only pretty , but intelligent too. A woman doing her own negotiations &amp; contract at that time 90&#39;s/early 2000&#39;s, is commendable.
Gresh, happy, innocente.... now she seems so sad.....i Feel bad for her ☹
Aish
Overact totally
This was a great show. So calming to listen to. Aish was such a beauty.
Beutyful women in this world.
I was 7 when this was out and now I’m 27 years old 🙂
Too overrated, ick!
I LOVE THAT NECKLACE NOT OVER YET ELEGANT AT THE SAME TIME
From my grandad, my dad and me, thats 3 generations enslaved by her.. She ain’t just women Aishwarya Rai is Literally The Goddess. We men should be at her feet 🦶🏼 where we belong
The best beautiful woman in the world ❤️
How simi mam said her most beautiful ?? Didn&#39;t she meet Madhuri dixit before? :)
What she feels whenever she looks herself in the mirror...omg beauty😍😍😍😍even her one pimple looks cute
Why she is sooo beautiful??? She is amazing!
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Oh she mentioned Salman !
Ash mention Salman most sexiest man in industries <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1335">22:15</a>.
I never seen like that beautyful woman...
Aish Looks Absolute Gorgeous and Very Ravishing😍
MashaAllah !She is combination of inner and outer beauty with smart brain..❤
AISHWARYA RAI BEST MISS WORLD
How this host could sit so calmly &amp; patiently in front of this DIVA!!!The gorgeous Aish.
Oh God this is one of the God&#39;s best creation love u Ash u r so beautiful
Sundata ka paryayvachi _ <b>aiswarya rai</b>
Bcs of her plastic surgeries,she lost her natural beauty.
So artificial Ash.  😐
Aishwarya y r so beatiful.anjel.
How can she beautiful like this much I&#39;m jealous
90&#39;s interviews just wow 😍
I think ...the great actress like jayalalithaa,savitri,sridevi,silk Smitha,soundarya, Aishwarya Rai have same acting career success and their innocent character ....I feel like that.  ..all 6 wonderful actress are gift to India....
Aisha fake beauty but kareena <br>Natural beauty🌹
I feel sorry for Aishwarya. People always criticizes her human flaws like weight gain, acne, and wrinkles. I would be insecure all the time.
Anyone watching this in 2020?🙋<br>Omg thank y&#39;all for 1.1k likes.👻

Eyes 😍😍😍GORGEOUS
Easily one of the prettiest faces in the world.
Even aishwarya agreed that salman is handsome in this interview
Whats with the accent
How many of watching in end of 2019 December
Most beautiful woman in this world😍😘
fake personality
Even the camera man focus her in a perfect way
Very Beautiful Aish!
What an elegant woman.. !! Completely floored!! No wonder she&#39;s the best miss world
I love how she talks
WOW I just focused on her face the whole interview 😍
The problem is that I cannot focus on what she is saying😍😍
I can&#39;t understand why such a beautiful, adorable, sensitive, elegant, gorgeous and pretty diva girl married to such a great looser, ignorant and an arrogant man named Abhishek Bachan,,,Totally wasted her life by chosen him as her hubby.
👍
There are better looking girls than her for sure... she is beautiful no doubt... but she was never box office ringer actress... she is mostly known for her beauty than acting....
Aww she&#39;s like an angel.
Aish looking so pretty💕
why simi always wear white outfit?
i think ash&#39;s english is very good
Btw can someone tell me what&#39;s the name of male model inder she was referring to
I want to see Aishwarya without make up
Aish looks like nagma sorry nagma looks like Aish in some angles ☺️😁
Omg her eyes 😍😍😍
Nobody is perfect... Well it&#39;s a saying.. But I would said.. God had made one that is perfect &quot;that is Aishwarya&quot;. Beautiful, intelligent, smart, mature........ No words to describe her.
Wow my lady crush❤️❤️
Ash is beautiful as the way she is .
Omg anyone viewing this till date......😍😍😍😍😍
I love aishhh
My brain is very fast
I wonder how can people write so skillfully in English man I&#39;m a simple man I can write like this only in a simple way so that everybody can understand what the hell I&#39;m trying to say😁
Such a sweet person!  Beautiful lips 🙏
Who else is watching this in 2019 😁
i see pre-salman, aish would always smile a lot and giggle and was so full of life. i rarely see her talking the same let alone a nice hearty laughter.
god shes soo gorgeous. so perfect.
Beautiful rich gals with good family background are the luckiest.
Her accent used to be less... Indian back then... Lol
Abb pta chl rha Salman itna pagal q tha
Beauty obviously made your life easier 😉
Plastic beauty..full makeup me to koi bhi accha dikhta hai...
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
She just described Abhishek Bachchan even before being with him. 😍
Mesti macam tu pengacara ingat dia..lagi cantik dari yg ditemuramah
Aishwarya is great
Kia ma kabhi Aish sy mil paoun ga meri sab sy khubsurat pasand meri Aish
Aishwarya is best
You can envy deepika or priyanka. Aish is beyond those feelings. She is so beautiful that rather than producing a feeling of envy one feels amused by her beauty. Just look at her in the movie devdas as paro she looks out of this world beautiful.
In this video plastic surgery is not done she Looks good but as she grows older she has done lots different surgery to look even more beautiful diva That&#39;s just fack that is not diva That&#39;s dangerous For long run
LOVE you Ash you are such a good human i look at you beyond your beautiful look bless you long and good life Amen
Beauty with brain. Such an adorable personality. 10/10 in all departments.
Gap is not good it&#39;s ridiculous disturb
She&#39;s really plastic. Even her smile and laughter seem fake.
💟👑
Only 1 thing I&#39;m not satisfied abt Aishwariya&#39;s face is that... Her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23eye">#Eye</a> Brows # ...Sushmita has very sharp n perfect Eye Brows... But her Eyes is for sure one in a million probably....honestly speaking Sush has many things better than Aish... She has Beautiful Hair.. Lovely Smile... Sharp Eye Brows.. Taller than Aish.. N has a cute Dimple on her face... Which made her Miss Universe... Even her eyes very Pleasant n Deep...
I am big fan of Aishwarya. She is very pretty and graceful person. Wonderful person.
Oh my god her beauty
Ashwaryia like a rose
Am on a Simi Garewell binging spree ! Started with the Rekha interview, right thru the Amitabh (obviously) one and now here. My family is stunned to see me take a sabbatical from my usual addictions on Youtube. But Simi is enthralling and her subjects are equally endearing with their fair share of fears and hopes and nearly &#39;ordinariness&#39;. Hop on to this fascinating ride if you care to !!!😉

Nice video 😃
Aishwarya
She’s the most beautiful woman in the world. I love her!
Glamorous stylish women
Personality attractive....lady... Aishwarya Rai Bachchan
She is perfect ladies.... talent Fashion..Dance...all most good
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is beautiful lady.
Aishwarya Rai  l love u so much my daughter I know you are bigger than me but I still call you my daughter because I love you so much sweetie am from South Sudan
Hello Simmi ji, plsss bring back this show; it&#39;s WONDERFUL❤
No one can beat this beauty! She’s the most beautiful woman in the world, undoubtedly!
Aishwarya is soooooo beautiful...Simi please bring her back
I have a list Aishwarya, Adriana Lima, Barbara Mori are on it, the most beautiful!
Her face has changed a lot over the years. She looked soft, smooth and innocent back then ... now her features look very sharp. i think cos of the surgeries she’s had.
Aishwarya is best
She is so fake
Beaucoup de gens sont jaloux de son succès mais ashwarya rai et très belle . Et sympa aux fond.
Simi n aish look almost same both r timeless beauties n gifted!
Diva
I watched this one entire episode just 4 that &quot;Salman Khan&quot; !!
Except from her eyes, she has a very beautiful symmetrical face which makes her even attractive
Her eyes♥
You cannot change your future, but, you can change your habits, and surely your habits will change your future....<br> Yes ...It&#39;s so difficult to practice that...
Neki
Did anyone notice when she described whats her &quot;type&quot;, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1219">20:19</a> ish she described Abhishek Bachchan to the fucking T? Good for you Aishoo, always my inspiration.
Semi you did   interview with sridevi
Her beauty is very rare, barbie doll description is not even close to her, shes way too perfect
Salman dstroyed ash movie cariar<br>Because when ash sallu brake up happand<br>Bollywood big star and daractor<br>Never work with ash
I am a big fan of aishwarya ma&#39;am
I always admire ash
She always has been far mature than her age. Wht clarity of thoughts.
Abhishek bacchan has all those quality she mentioned in this interview:O
Dreamgirl Aishwarya
Shez so intelligent n sensible! V prettyy as well!
She was so happy, chirpy and chatty...the salman effect on her
She is very down to earth...❤️❤️<br>Not at all arrogant...
This lady is evergreen when it comes to beauty! Even after 17years, we are still watching this video which clearly directs to the fact that we simply love &quot;Aishwarya&quot;. If someday I wake up looking atleast 10 percent like her, then I would never go back to sleep again!!
She is pretty but trust me I have friends who are much attractive than her and isn&#39;t even half as boring as her. She is considered goddess by half witted people who  are simply nodding their heads along. I have no issue with her beauty but she&#39;s definitely not a good actress infact she&#39;s horrible. She can only do a certain kind of acting <b>ada ada</b> adakari that&#39;s why she did good in devdas. Any real acting is out of her league. I don&#39;t mean talk her down but stop worshipping her. She&#39;s definitely not the finest woman and there are people who are worth being called an idol she&#39;s not even close to being one. <br>And Her voice with fake accent and zabardasti ke giggles are ripping off my ears
It&#39;s just because of beauty, Aishwarya got a very easy life with people literally bowing to her feet. <br>While Simi ji is grace personified and elegance!
Masha Allah..Love her..
Sooo beautiful.... Every one has diff choices but for me she is most beautiful woman.. i wonder y she is sooo beautiful m envy her..
I cannot believe it...this woman is so... Amazing! Beautiful is such a cliche for her, she is extra ordinary! <br>Its really impossible that any guy will not fall for her, just look at her! She is grace personified
I love when she does hmm hmm
Such a bad necklace!!
she is most beautiful woman &amp; it&#39;s not fake .. it&#39;s real..
Aishwarya is best
God made some people so beautiful like Ash♡
She is gorgeous and so are many Indian actresses. Only thing I dislike is when they paint their faces white. Embrace your natural complexions please .
many girls are much prettier than aish or any other actresses but after getting fame they become celebrity so people start saying even they r beautiful or not
मन्द शीतल सुगन्धित पवन आज है।<br>दिल में तेरे छिपे कुछ मेरे राज है।।<br><br>लाख जतनों के बाद भी जहां सुन न पाया।<br>आ रही तेरे दिल की वो आवाज हैं। <br><br>तेरी आँखों में हैं कुछ राज गहरे। <br>तेरी हसरतों पर हैं जमाने के पहरे॥<br><br><br><br>विकास पाण्डेय
who the hell dislikes this. ....
😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
My my she is d most beautiful and wonderful women ever created. I love u ash
Magic of Simiji transforms the most bubbly n loud to very elegant n pois.
She looks same,her features are same,is obviously she has no plastic surgery because today she looks same as here<br>She is an angel. To much beautiful!
I envy salman for getting her and pity him for losing her!
Aish is a pure and a natural beauty. By her prsonality by her mind and emotion.
Her eyes say something, bolti hui aankhe.her beauty is beyond the world.unique beauty while sush is a unique personality.
The most beautiful woman &lt;3
Such class , such grace n elegance!!! So level headed , intelligent n balanced!I ve tremondous respect fr this woman! Truly a gem n yes soooo sooo so beautiful!
I hate fake aish and her fake smile .
Her words and the sentence formation makes it clear how intelligent and smart she&#39;s. Her beauty , we all know about it , what I admire is her way of tackling question and answering in the best way
She is d most beautiful Miss India...world..God she is simply perfect
If she had her beauty and sushmita sen&#39;s personality ...... Man o man what a woman she would have been.
she is so beautiful
Aishwarya Rai..A poetry in motion..Watch her and hear her..
and also Simi ji is nice person
nice interview with aishwarya mam I love her so much
Beauty with Brain.......
Sushmita Sen any day over Aishwariya...sorry folks!!!!
aishwarya ki beauty natural h..plastic surfery kitta v koi krwa le..itta khubsurat ni ho skta..aish ki face cut..eyes nose evrything is perfect..
she is so beautiful...but all fake nature....
I love aish
I think she is from heaven 😍<br>Love u Ash.....
Pimple on the right seek.Loud make-up could not conceal it.
She used to be so HAPPY. Ever since she married abhishek, her life got ruined and she always looks upset . That controlling family!!
Simi Garewal is way more beautiful than Aishwarya Rai.
of all the interviews by Simi garewall ji, Jayalalithaji S superb N excellent.Her way of answering, English N voice N ideas , her face superb
I watched the interview with the sound off. This woman is beautiful beyond words but god she bores me to death
So beautiful
Her voice has changed so much
One word beautiful
Is she a doll or a nymph?? Doesn&#39;t look like a human a bit ;p
My favorite heroine.... she is very beautiful
wooowww aish ur marvellous
Omg.....i just can&#39;t stop staring at her...😍😍😍
Eyes speak everything
Have seen no one as beautiful as Aishwarya!
Aishwarya Rai you looks gorgeous
nice
Her gigglings are very irritaing.even her laughter for that matter.
aishwarya is a classic beauty a mixture of brain and brawn
so beautifull
Trying to imitate  brooke shields  when she was young....... Just watch carefully
She is very humble .love aishwarya 😘
Such a beautiful lady....... Her face cut, her eyes, her nose everything perfect..... She is not at all plastic... It is because of evolution... A person&#39;s looks changes with time... Will I look the same in 18 and 30???the news of her plastic surgery is made by common people... And fool people believe in those news
One thing I never understand why people call her fake!! What do they want her to do??Be a bitch,say anything what comes to <a href="http://mind.no/">mind.no</a> ...she is a personality.every personality maintains their image,dignity..people needs to understand that.
Omg I can watch her more n more..such a beauty ..
Linda belleza estupenda..
Gud
who is INDER ? Ash talking about
I hate the way she is talking ,
Simi garewal is a wonderful interviewer, every question was so genuine..and good
Is anyone more beautiful than one and only Aishwarya Rai? the answer is - No!
Godesss like beauty Ash ....completely ethereal!!!!
Nearly after 20 years ...I leave my comment here .... and I can say this women has stood the test of time with grace , poise, elegance, humility and respect .... the term beauty is a cliche in the case of my and everyone&#39;s Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.
Seriously no one is as beautiful as her....omg she is unreal....she is madhubala of our genrtn
Ayshwati rai is so beautiful
I Love her . She is a grt example   for both youngsters and adults😋😊♡♡♡
Ash said she follows buddhist method of middle way
No doubt, she is beautiful... But Sushmita is beauty in and out. Sushmita seems genuine with every words she speak.

most beautiful eyes
i love this show<br>so real and honest
a 20 year old so mature
she is just an ornamental piece.  can&#39;t act fr nuts. very artificial. fit fr modelling
aishwrya u are the best nd jb log apki burai kartey hai wo ap se jalte hai
So beautiful Aishwarya..god bless you..:)
She seems a bit fake here but she is a world away from some of the young actresses of today. Back in the day, you could tell someone was educated just by listening to them talk, even though Aishwarya hadn&#39;t even finished her degree. Whereas actress with engineering degrees today reflect no intellect in their speech. Sorry state of affairs as far as India&#39;s education system is concerned.
Ash is scorpion girl and these sign of people never bosting n genuine. good looking people. Simple , kind heart,
brain with beauty 😘
very nice
she is sooooooo beutiful😍😍😍😍😍😍😍Aish
Aish😍😍😍💕💕💕
mashallah
wowssss.... such dream girl 😘😘
what a deep beautiful woman..
dream gal
what a phony woman - and that is Aish. What a pretentious person - what a show.
Simi... you speak so elegantly. I really appreciate
she is the most beautiful Miss, both Miss Universe. If she is awfully high amazing 1.80m
can anyone tell me what the name of the second man she likes,after Salman-she is saying it after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76tkBEla6Oo&amp;t=1364">22:44</a>? Indar?  I can not understand the name?
I just love Simi Garewal shes so hot &amp; gorgeous even @ this age &amp; i love the background music lal alala ala , i remember my school days watching this show &amp; talking the same in class. Simi plz come back sooner with the show we love it Muuuuuuah
poor girl this was before Salman Khan happened to her
Fire and ice &lt;3
only her eyes is beautiful other than that ..there is nothing to get impressive
I wanna cover my face for my entire life after looking at aish face
Such a brainy woman behind the apparent beauty! She&#39;s so unlike many other actors who ride the world just with their looks! :)
beautiful...
Aishwarya Rai is really beautiful. Its sad that light skin with light eyes is seen as only beautiful in India
charming lady Aish :)
One and only beautiful woman in the world . Oh god she is so gorgeous
alright I need to confess now...I ve been following ur show since last couple of weeks and ghosh what a charm u ve over me...u r elegant beautiful and as dev anand said &quot;bubbly&quot;...I saw almost all the episodes and I wonder there is a lot more to talk about...plz plz come back...trust me a lot more talent has come up during this vacant period

aishwarya tooo much beautiful but simiji ek request cant be interview in Hindi our Natinal language n also many more can join us rest up to u simmiji ur sooo beautiful
Thank you so much for deleting the distasteful comments yourself. We appreciate it.
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!
lol why is she trying to fake the accent
My brain is slow I can&#39;t understand those big words they are using 😞
A bright,eloquent and beautiful woman!i thoroughly enjoyed this interview!
Funny how every beautiful woman is automatically perceived to be FAKE or associated with PLASTIC SURGERY. Like can a woman not be God gifted for her looks????? Aish is God-gifted. Lets just all accept this fact and stop calling her fake.
Love simi but rai is so fake. So much surgery and lightening and so called dance practice yet she has no charisma or dance OR actinf talent. just an objectification  and corrupt beauty contest!  <br><br>I wish simi would only interview those who GENUINELY achieved things
love u love u love u.....mmmmmmhhhhhhh
i like her eyes. she is so beautiful.
luvu aish
Aish is the REALY QUEEN OF BOLLYWODD, WITH HER GRACY, DIGNITY, SOFT SPOKEN LADY, SHE IS PERSONA OF ELEGANCE.
Hello Simi, please continue ur show, it&#39;s awesome and so different from rest of the shows. Please bring Aish again, we loved her old interviews. Thank you
Always watch this every couple of months...She is SO beautiful and has a unique personality
She is very eloquent and beautiful i wish i were her
Lol when she was talking about crabs in a barrel mentality its so true though.
I love her laugh and giggle she seem tweet
Wow she looks really pretty, i think she is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. I&#39;m kind of envious but not in a bad way, good for her.
Believe me Aishu is not a normal human being. She is Divine. Angelic. Her soul is much more beautiful than her face. To understand this you need to be blessed. To be honest, I wish I was her brother so that I could spend my childhood with such a sweet sister. Incidentally I was born from a place from where she was born.
the first name that popped to her head after 2mins of contemplating was salman khan! interesting...
shes so amazing!
realy amazing show elegant so sophicated shw it shuld come again
i love her accent! 
Lara is more impressive dan ash
A personal request: Please try not to make negative racial or religious comments. Surely we are all educated and evolved. Let&#39;s not be so judgemental. This is not a beauty competition! Its a simple interview; and I hope you can watch it in the same generous spirit as you have watched my other Rendezvous shows. Thanks, Simi Garewal
Aish has an aura ,she is beautiful, touching,sweet,sensitive and intelligent.Thank god she married Abbhi ! the perfec guy for her,she deserves to be happy
Thank you Ash for all your contributions, God bless you and your new family!
omg shes so pretty i wish i could look like her
She is so fresh and so beautiful, SO GORGEOUS!!
She is better when quiet. i just don&#39;t like her fake talks, expressions and the giggling which she does. Lookwise ofcourse she is beautiful but the rest aha..
freaking gorgeous
Defnitely the most beautiful women in the world. Just very annoying the way she always giggles
Even if she doesn&#39;t talk, her eyes speaks everything...<br>She&#39;s so stunning and gorgeous.. She&#39;s like d living helen of troy....
EVERYONE Looks STUNNINGLY GREAT LOOKING in Rendezvous with Simi Garewal EXCEPT Aishwarya!!??? How come?? Even a PREGNANT Sussanne was looking stunning with beautiful eyes! And Kareena Looked SO STUNNING Natural beauty! But Aish looked less than ordinary than how she&#39;s made to look always!? Her Hair, her eyes look so small, her lips r bigger than her eyes, she skin texture, complexion all fake, hair texture yuck n hair r so thin/scarce, she has a small face, wrinkly short neck. Nowadays her face lloks oval from left to right than length-wise top to bottom :D as if someone punched her from bottom of her chin :D May be cuz EXTREME PHOTOSHOP n EXTREME MAKEUP was not done !!! :D Her body , her hands , feet look like of a Child n not a sexy young woman. n Dont get me started with her PERSONALITY, her way of talking so FAKE n ANNOYING!!! She always try to look what she&#39;s NOT ! Full of herself, Hypocrite!!! REPULSIVE REPULSIVE Extremely Disgustingly Diplomatic n Fake not at all HONEST !!!
She sounds so fake, 
I adore Aish!! That show intro was so weird lol.
She is so gorgeous and well spoken. Great example for young women!
Her laugh is annoying :(
She&#39;s so beautiful and smart ,well spoken and NOT fake!
Shes so cheesy
At the end she better cud have complimented her for her intelligence than beauty. She knows shes beautiful lol
lovely isnt she?
How stupid of people coming to. Aishwarya video and commenting about other random girls.go to your favorites video then
well yeah you are right... But you have to admit that she is beautiful!! there would be many more beautiful women and men in years to come. There was and there have been...
She was dating Salman in 1999 which is also why she seemed very happy at the time of this interview as her relationship with salman was new and still blossoming and she was enjoying every bit of it being in love with him. When Simi asked about who do you think is the sexy and gorgeous man, Aishwarya answered Salman after being giggly and acting like a stupid person.
Simi &quot; beauty obviously made your life easier&quot;
yes PC always copied ASH&#39;s quote.N another quote PC copied frm ASH z &quot;NO1 frm my family or xtended family ever belonged 2 showbiz&quot; n so many others also copied ASH....even SALLU,KAT,DEEPIKA all d tym inspired by ASH&#39;s all interiew......ASH U R SUCH A ROLE MODEL.
WOW! Priyanka chopra LITERALLY copied aishwarya&#39;s answer about education and degree in an interview in britain! cant believe how she literally copied ash word for word &#39;&#39;im all for education cos im worried one day my kids will turn around and say you never did it&#39;&#39;!! <br>anyway thanks for the vid aishwarya, as always, a complete pleasure, joy and inspiration to watch x
YAY! Please do and soon. I felt the exact same thing when I was watching this video. Sounds just like Abhishek indeed. How sweet. Aishwarya is so inspiring and a wonderful role model. 

Thanks Simi Mam ...your interviews are really one of a kind :)
that would be difficult, not becuase there arent more beautiful girls than her, but simply becuase not everyone has an army of hairstylists, pedicurers, make up artists, costume designers, high tech photographers, plus their own personal trainer unlike her. she&#39;s pretty yes, but yet over the most beautiful woman shit

maybe it does to u, but i&#39;m sorry to say that the world does not revolve around will smith and julia roberts, niether does it mean that the majority of the populations view on whos beautiful or not is not valued just because theyre not famous
grow up
Aishwarya is so naive in this episode and Simi is having a field day with it. If she asked Aishwarya today &quot;One honest confession?&quot; She would not get an honest answer.
lol nice ,waiting for their interview together

YA THIS WAS BEFORE SALLU AND ALL WOMEN SOUND PRETTIER AND MUCH SOFTER BEFORE MEN BREAK THEIR HEARTS LOL NOW SHE MUCH MORE GUARDED DIPLOMATIC AND EASILY VULNERABLE TO MORE SLIGHT AND LOSES HER TEMPER EASILY
AISH IS TRYING TO MATCH GAREWAL&#39;S ACCENT OFCOURSE POST CANNES SHE HAS LEFT GAREWAL FAR BEHIND LOLS
U MUST BE HALLUCINATING LOLZ....IF U FEEL ALL STARS ARE IN PVT WOT THEY PORTRAY ON RED CARPET
When she describes possibly growing to love someone from friendship all I can think about is her relationship with Ahbishek. It&#39;s almost like she knew her future. 
OMG....I think this interview was before &quot;SALLU CHAPTER&quot;.....AISH was soo innocent and lovely.........I just love AISH..
She&#39;s seems so sweet &amp; naive. Love her.
The reason Aishwarya rai is called the most beautiful woman in the world is because many people think she is.Famous people like Will smith,Julia Roberts have said she is the most beautiful woman in the world.The MAJORITY think she is.

I don&#39;t find Perla beltran,natalie glebova,antonia iacobesco or chralize theron to be pretty at all.Aishwarya is far more beautiful.

I do find Megan fox and Iryna Zhuravskaya to pretty.But I will not say they are most beautiful just because I find them pretty.


I agree for some reason she doesn&#39;t act real. Idk why she does that but this interview seems so fake
I don&#39;t know where this idea has spread that Aishwarya is &quot;fake&quot;, but people seem to be regurgitating it without even thinking about what they are saying. If you&#39;re going to watch an interview like this, have some respect for the people in the interview. Unless you personally know Aishwarya, you cannot say that she is fake. If you have no interest in seeing an interview with Aishwarya while having a negative impression of her, then don&#39;t watch it or don&#39;t leave hateful comments. 
This interview was done in 1999. 
At 20:04 when simi ask aish what&#39;s your type of person she says sensitive, honest, respect others, great sense of humour. Have u noticed that she was actually describing abhishek bachan. He is exactly the way aish described.
Yeah, those girls you&#39;ve told me about are drop dead perfect stunners. I haven&#39;t seen women as pretty as that, thanks for the names! They even beat the women in hollywood. 
Another incredibly stunning woman is Charlize Theron, right?
 I already knew about antonia, she is just gorgeous isn&#39;t she. To be honest I think she&#39;s at the same level as Aish not prettier like you said, Aish has a more perfect face shape but Antonia has the advantage of sparkling bright green eyes and luminous skin. 
love you aish
Seriously???
it looks so made up and fake
One person who never quite touches ur heart anytime!Something abt her tht makes u so uncomfortable,eerie,detesting,bored,superficial,fake that u want to avoid being in that space any longer.The warmth of genuineness never comes thru her personality,its all made up for reasons best known to her!Nothing tht she says in this interview will make u reflect on why pple call her fake.Infact aftr watching this u will certainly knw why indeed they call her fake!!One of the most &quot;plastic&quot; interviews ever!
thank u =]
By far, Ash is the prettiest women on planet. The girls simply can&#39;t stand anyone looking more attractive than them due to envy, of course!
wish people would stop referring to themselves at &#39;one&#39;
Itna khoobsurat chehra hai tumhara
har dil diwana hai tumhara
log kehte hai chand ka tukda ho tum
lekin hum kehte hai chand tukda hai tumhara..........ASH
&lt;3&lt;3
I agree she&#39;s beautiful but not the most beautiful
Exactly, I agree with you. 
Will smith,Julia Roberts and many other famous people have said Aishwarya Rai is the most beautiful woman in the world.

You find Kristin Kreuk to be more beautiful but don&#39;t say as if the majority agree with you because they evidently don&#39;t.
Thats dead or alive.

Elizabeth taylor in her prime and Vivien leigh.
She is sooo beautiful, she is the prettiest woman i&#39;ve seen, but i dont like her personality :/
your so obsessed with a woman you don&#39;t even know that you tell other people to go to hell? Ok.... please get help.
I love her voice &amp; the way she responds .so lovely aish ...love u a lot
Aishwarya looks gorgeous &amp; so  elegant.love her
Your a crazy bitch and its a disgrace that you call yourself Aishwarya&#39;s fan. So what? I find kristin kreuk a million times prettier and most people agree with me. aish is pretty but she can&#39;t compete with kristin kreuk deal with it.
Kristin Kreuk is more beautiful than aishwarya rai
after watching susmita&#39;s rendezvous ash is so dumb! and sorry she is FAKE! so iqless....even Simi was getting bored with her...she was much entertained with the intelligent Susmita
Yeah i agree, not only actresses, there are much more prettier/beautyfull girls than her on the streets.  
because she has winned miss world does not mean shes really the most beautyfull girl on the earth! thats nonsense. there are certainly  more beautyfull peoples outside the cinemaworld. 
How com Salman after so many bad relationships still considered God by some people n she with just 2 relationships is considered manipulating. Se was n famous way before Salman came to her life. In fact Salman n Vivek became famous coz of her. She is v professional n good person n her professional n personal life talks a lot abt it.
lol!!! And what do you look like, ma&#39;am???

u r beautiful
yea aishwarya is pretty, but theres so many other beautiful actresses who  actually have beautiful indian features
Ha! Who have you seen that is more beautiful? Name one girl...
I think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world! 
I like the way she talk and how she answers. She has that aura that made her like a princess!!! She&#39;s beautiful!!
breathtakingly beautiful:)
Aishwarya told &quot;The Sexiest &amp; most gorgeous (Charming) man&quot; is Salman Khan at 21:40 . This was before there relationship started... @BeingSalmanKhan
She is beautiful, intelligent and articulate..I think that combination scares a lot of people.

She is really beautiful,but  not so interested some how,i am always salute to Holly wood Actor and an Actress ,Bratt Patt and his wife,Angelina Jolie have heart for others,they adopt so many kids from different nationality beside their own kids.-------GORGEOUS ALWAYS ADMIRED.
every individual has a beauty but it looks in a different ways...and that is her ways to make herself beauty..
so you must have your own and unique way
Out of this world Beauty !!
what is the name of the song?

Can she be any less fake gosh she is so annoying!!
what a graceful woman Aishwarya Rai is .. i have always loved her and still do :)
She is the best!!!
shez﻿ a priceless beauty of india...so waste a billion to spoil her name....its juzt waste of ur time...n her faithful fans r been enchanted enough for their lifetime by her beauty﻿ so god bless u ashhh....wanna see u back
shez﻿ a priceless beauty of india...so waste a billion to spoil her name....its juzt waste of ur time...n her faithful fans r been enchanted enough for their lifetime by her beauty﻿ so god bless u ashhh....wanna see u back

pretty charming miss world anyday :)
yes she is 

So beautiful. I love her &lt;3
she﻿ is the most beautiful woman in the world...
she﻿ is the most beautiful woman in the world...
she﻿ is the most beautiful woman in the world...
She dosent need a Certificate.............
U look @ ur face in d mirror first B4 commenting on ASH ....Lidiya
inner beauty + exterior beauty +   rit attitude makes the most beautiful women (among many gud lukin womens)
aish is not so beautiful. thera are so many girls in india who looks beautiful than aish.she is not a goddess she looks like a witch.
she is soooo hot ......ash
yes right...but u are (lol)
So are you?
salman really like beautiful girl.ash and katrina r gorgeous
wow! Someone doing that has a lot of free time. I get your point now. Quite ridiculous actually. You should go ahead with whatever action you need to take.
I disagree, Aish might be very beautiful, but my mum is the most beautiful on the earth for me :D.
As far as I know many famous people have said that she is. 

Will smith has said about Aishwarya Rai &quot;She&#39;s the mould that God made the first woman from&quot;

Julia Roberts has said &quot;Aishwarya Rai is the most beautiful woman in the world&quot;

And many others also think that she is.
I dont understand all this hate towards her at all. She was humble and adorable throughout it all; in short get a life.
And this is what we call violation of freedom of expression. Sure I don&#39;t hate Ash or anyone for that matter and find it quite idiotic that people could passionately dislike somebody they don&#39;t even know, but I would still defend their right to express their disregard. If people can shower their love on a video, they are very well in their rights to do quite the opposite as well.
oh hello there, moron obsessed spammers!!

Aishwarya is the best!!
Very well said...  She is taking all credits as if she is the most beautiful girl ever..
Ash is so immature... She is replying as if she is the only one who is beautiful in the world... Get a life... 
I hope you succeed in banning those paid spammers, haters or whatever they are! They are poisoning all Aish&#39;s youtube clips...Thank you! All the best!
That maybe true. But you ARE the most jealous person in the world.
@SimiGarewalOfficial Sure that person is an ass byt if they want to dislike a comment, its their choice. You have no right to block them. Oh, wait, are you gonna block me now for dusagreeing with you and not falling at Aishwarya Rai&#39;s feet? Pathetic.
ash is so natural and sensible..............
i think simi is a very beautiful person
QUIEN PUDIERA TENER ESE ROSTRO
Thank you so much for putting this interview. I learned to appreciate what i have. 
goddess
Every bollywood heroines(not good actresses) are like that, the only way to survive is by hooking up with these uncles. This is still happening to new breed of bollywood heroines. Vidya Balan, Konkana Sen had to wait to get good roles. Vidya can afford to look non-heroine due to changing trend in content based films that don&#39;t need stars and heroines. Deepika&#39;s,Kareena&#39;s,Katrina&#39;s and more are doing the same thing as Ash. Kareena&#39;s super hits were only due to Khans.
As much as Ash hooked up to Salman to get roles, he used her for her beauty.  In the past people didn&#39;t just want Salman, they wanted Aish to be paired with him. Salman, other top actors and directors always want a fair beauty and Ash is not the first and last person to be their arm candy.Ash didn&#39;t have acting talents, but she was in the inner circles of who&#39;s who of bollywood. Salman didn&#39;t chose another actress with talent, he was besotted by her. Not Ash&#39;s fault.
aishwarya is the best....intellectual diva...very sensitive like a flower

Then... NEVER watch her videos.
she looks gorgeous!

I am surprised that she was called fake then. At least in this interview she didnt&#39; come across as fake. But anything post-Salman does make her appear fake. She really has to stop giggling too much and stop talking as though Salman is judging her every word.
beauty 
multiple comment on a video of someone you despise makes me question your real intentions. good thing ash&#39;s fame has had no affect due to haters like you.
she&#39;s gorgeous, brillient  man god is unfaire why can&#39;t i be ........god din&#39;t give me enything except life ,i&#39;m not cute nor brillient no boobs i&#39;m little and i have to try to survive ...everyday  is war for me ..... but then again you are beautiful show them girl ...

What a amazing
She already had roles before Salman entered her life. Even though she didn&#39;t have huge hits like she finally got with HDDCS, she was the most wanted actress. Directors and actors go behind her not the other way around. Obviously, Aish and many actresses who are models and or pageant contestants who have no acting talent, that get films with top actor and directors are considered to be using those people to get to the top. It&#39;s not so, it has to do with bollywood using women are only beautiful.
Freakin&#39; hell is she a sight for sore eyes! Lovely. So much hate she garners though :-(
