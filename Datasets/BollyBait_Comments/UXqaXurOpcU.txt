where is hakla srk for ram jane, duplicate, koyla and many more such movies?
No can beat legend of over acting varun dhawan ❤❤❤❤
Its incredible Jammuy!That you actually sit through and watch these gems.
There are many SRK movies in early 90s even anjaam and darr was overacting
Kaunse Plane mein Signal aata hai??
ah.           Planeee........crashh💥 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=289">4:49</a>
Nice video
Looks TRP has disappointed this around. Surely, there are more instances of over acting. May be you couldn&#39;t get rights to those scenes. Who can forget gems like: Arjun Pandit and Gunda. These 2 movies alone boast of many scenes which can easily top those shown in this video by a country mile. I think you have had these movies in some of your lists earlier. But surely, you weren&#39;t able to watch these movies patiently enough to uncover those scenes :D!
Bruh !! Where them clowns Krk and Sonu Nigam at !? Their acting  could make a sober person tweek like they be on Molly
I felt worried about Rekha when he said PARkash (not PRAkash) , I love Rekha 😂😂😂
😂😂 aur Plane crash !! Lekin ye kaunsa airlines hai jisme hawa me Network rehta hai jo dev and anand ne apne wife se Baat ki 🙏🤪😝😝
mai mera jeevan ka bita hua 5 mint ..pana caahta hu..paana caahta hu..pana cahhta hu
where is legendary KRK of Desh drohi
Thank God being an Cinemaholic I&#39;m not a part of audience of these movies,I think if i may could watch MASTER then my whole life will went in scratching walls 😂
Rajesh Khanna and dev anand two great example of why you should take step down when you past your prime and not desperately try to proof you can still act.
Dev An and was not an actor at all
Why don&#39;t you make this on South Indian movies?
I&#39;m sorry Anmol, but you fart&#39;s timing was really off 😂😂😂
After watching @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=350">5:50</a> ..bhai mai tere muh par paana phekna chata hun....to tighten his brain bolts..hilarious acting! Wonder how a good actor like Rakesh Bedi kept a straight face through this travesty.
How can you miss the epic manoj kumar&#39;s clerk..
Wrong : Dev Anand was past his prime after 1971 Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Movies he made and acted after that were all crap. Rajesh Khanna was past his prime after Big B&#39;s zanjeer in 1973.
Aur aur....plane crash 🤣 lol
Stop butchering my name
Was the last guy from start plus Mahabharata (bheem)????

Most of the Bollywood actors except some of the stage background actors like Paresh Rawal, Naseeruddin shah, om puri, Irfan khan, Amrish puri, Nawasuddin siddiqui etc don’t have any kinds of acting skills. All are either with good looks or with family background survives in films.

Exposes ..How  fools  are bollywood  buggs..  they r  overhyped   unnecessarly..
Worst commentary
These were not overacting but horrible acting.
The first one is not overacting but it was underacting.
Anu
Hrithik Roshan in main prem ki deewani hoon....yikesss!! So embarrassing to watch!

Maine dekha re bhai &quot;Wafa&quot;
That Anand&#39;s son 😂😂😂😂
Hahaha... Those farts. 😷 With all due respect to his stardom, Rajesh Khanna was a bad actor. I liked him only in Anand. Baki sab bakwas.
Kaise kaison ko diya hai.... Aise waise ko diya hai
The dubbing  of that Hong Kong officer 😂😂😂😂😂
Oh no you forgot Varun dhawan in inception
Lol the FART SCENE was too good!!!!
Chikh pukar aur..............................(.plane crash )
You were wrong mere bhai when you said that the talentless exuse for an actor Suneil Anand didn&#39;t follow in his father&#39;s footsteps... when it came to cringey and pathetic acting, he definitely DID. Dev Anand was past his prime many years ago and he should have retired but was determined to make those third rate &quot;comedies&quot;, how anyone can call that art, I will never know. It&#39;s interesting how Indian Cinema&#39;s veterans who were so good in their heyday sadly lose the plot in their later years... Dev Anand, Rajesh Khanna, Manoj Kumar ( after the classic KRANTI never was able to gain any critical or financial success in anymore of his directorial ventures ), Feroz Khan was electric to watch even towards the end of his life, but his directing talents (especially involving his shit son) were forgettable to say the least. It&#39;s about time these talentless sons and daughters of older actors actually got themselves proper jobs instead of torturing the cinema going public.
Please Fardeen Khan&#39;s acting was perfect.
Jaanashee does not deserve this list, rest is fine.
Nice now I need jhandu pancharist to digest this cringe
Good video 👌....but I really got lost in your mesmerizing voice.... accent...and great comand over English language 👍
Hilarious .... When u said rajesh khanna covering his face every 10 sec as if laila Khan is farting with her every dialogue delivery
Rajesh khanna might be suppresseing his laugh
Why have you added sub titles? Very annoying
SUNIEL ANAND HAHAHAHA 😂
Sunil anand looks like Dev anand&#39;s brother rather than his son<br>😄<br>Anyone else agrees with me???
Bhai tu bohat hi &quot;mummy daddy&quot; hai waise. <br>Josh .... Ay.... Jawani
First one was hilariously funny
Mummy nai rahin sweety darling 😂😂😂😂
The farting part🤣🙌🏻
Seeing all this 💩must be painful
Bhai 90 percent of them are faltu actors scripts thieves. All about family members promote their good for nothing kids in balls wood, politics, businesses...<br>Dhavan, hritik,sridivi kids, dharmendra kids, bacchan kids, bhatt kids, padukone bitch and prianka overacting ki dukaan, Salman bhaijaan jabardasti acting, Akshay goomaar, mimics Keanu reeves fails miserably almost looks like a hijda walking, pappu maino ghandi, bianca ghandi, reliance kids, all hyped, overrated. Mediocre... I never watch all this thrash, but will tell all you who watch them. Buy pirated for not more than rs 30. Inki aasli aukaad ye hi hai. Chappal chor chutiyas
What who gets network while on a moving...... plane?
How does he possibly watch these films is what comes as a shock to me .
Legend 😂😂😂<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=268">4:28</a>
kitna research karke banata he video wah bhai wah
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0M6-nm1jRo">https://youtu.be/Z0M6-nm1jRo</a>
I love Rekha 😂😂😂
Rajesh Khanna&#39;s was the best, actress farting 🤣🤣🤣🤣
devanand&#39;s all movies are over acted so as raj kumar&#39;s and shatrughan sinha and many more&#39;s ••• as per your opinion,i think .
Rip Lela khan
Senior actors are not done as expected means may be directors asking for more takes . Directors fault .
Shame you India. Fuck
Make video on same actors  who had one small role to play but nailed it. Just like that women in singham  returns that woman who played  the role of that kids mother who took money from the politician to give him vote
One episode should be dedicated to launch of the kids (flop) by their veteran parents. Karan deol, fardeen khan etc
Hahaaaaaaaa
Sweety darling 😂😂😂😂😂😂<br>Parkaash 😅😅😅😅😅
“Bolo Mr. Jeevan” 😂😂😂😂
Plane crash....!!!!!!!?😅😅😅😅😅
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=285">4:45</a> Devanand was talking to her wife when she was in the air, technology of 80&#39;s was quite advance no?
It feels really bad to see a legend like Rajesh Khanna and Dev Anand doing such work
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=347">5:47</a> agar koi garage me kaam karta hai to please ise koi pana lake do 🤦‍♂😂🤣
😁😁😁😁
Where is himalay
Sir I don’t see any wrong on any of them it’s all over the director who need to shape the screen . It’s his idea how to make natural projection of drama. Actors just follow what they are told to do. That’s all. Specially Dev shaab how is supposed to act on such a tragedy scene. How will another actor react on That situation. They all do same or even worse. So directions is responsible for all of these.  ! If I’m wrong correct me. ! 😊
1. Shahrukh khan - Ram Jane,  Duplicate, Guddu etc<br>2. Ranvir Singh - Simba<br>3. Varun dhawan- Dishoom, Judwa<br>4. Aamir Khan- Mela,  Thugs of Hindostan<br>5. Salman Khan- Hello Brother<br>6. Kareena kapoor - Mai Prem Ki deewane hoom, khushi<br>7. Amitabh Bacchan - RGV ki aag<br>8. Akshay Kumar - singh is bling, Teesmaarkhan<br>9. Saif - humshakals <br><br><br>Please tell me if you agree..
Mela starring twinkle was ott...just thinking of some scenes makes me cringe😂😖<br>And ofc main prem ki diwani hoon was just🤢🤢🤢<br>Kareena as pooh in kabhi khushi kabhi gam in the intro part was well something i never wanna see or hear ever again!
That  &#39;candid&#39; pic at the end..😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmGOnXytAlw">https://youtu.be/WmGOnXytAlw</a><br><br>This is funniest scene I hv seen ever.

I&#39;ve seen very little Bollywood movies but much much more overacting scenes than these ones. Am speechless wondering how they&#39;re picked 😳!. Obviously very lazy-ly.
Funny video but narrator&#39;s Indian accent English is even funnier its hilarious indian accent English 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Mummy Nahi Rahi Sweety Darling 😂😂😂
Aagya angrez ka choda
Fardeen Khan&#39;s scene shouldn&#39;t be added
Kareena kapoor in Mea prem ki diwani hun, kareena in khushi movie

Brilliant collection. Makes you wonder how some even made it to the stardom status ☺️☺️☺️
Bhai jhelte kesse hi en fimlo koo.. Manna padega
fardeen khan and the last guy, bunty or whoever, not too bad. in the video shown at least. and in relative context to much worse acting in Bollywood movies, even by top stars. love in Times Square has some hilarious scenes especially the one with dev anand and others reacting to seeing planes crashing into twin towers.

U talk a lot n movie clips are of less duration.
Which is why outsiders like Ram Gopal Varma and all of his batch like Sri Ram Raghavan and Shimit Amin, others like Priya Darshan got succeeded :)
Farts were the best....😂😆🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
When the actor said Prakash mein kya karu? I almost screamed- acting chor de!😄

Shit! Bullshit! Chahe woh pyaar ho ya sad scenes, koi bhi actors/actress aisa apna jazbaat ka izhaar itna dramatically karta hai kya! I feel really sorry for legendary actors like Dev Anand &amp; Rajesh Khanna for such a spoilspot! They didn&#39;t deserve to be in this shitty bollywood films!

Well, I say that coz am a comms trainer in a BPO n the English I hear, even on TV channels is hilarious. For example, Amit Shah visited a Police memorial recently to observe the valAUr, not valor. Am amused as to how do these anchors get on national TV. 😂😂

Please share your views on this cringeworthy film named &quot;My Boss Bajrangbali&quot;. The action scene lasts for about 20 mins.. And I bet you guys just can&#39;t stop laughing<br>..
&quot;The room&quot; is considered the worst movie made in Hollywood. Then I watched Sunil Anand.. n then thought of half of Bollywood movies.

Bhai Hindi me bol
What about Shiny Ahuja in Bhool Bhulaiyya 🙄🙄
Considering Rajesh Khanna &amp; Dev Anand, I think these were one of the worst actors apart from 1-2 films ... other films of them were hit due to other reasons like plot or music. Dev anand was same throughout his career. His films were hit due to vijay anand or guru dutt , I must agree, dev anand had good sense of music, that too I doubt when he made films like mister prime minister with pathetic music 🙄
You must watch preity zinta in dil chahta hai saying the dialogues &quot;sorry rohit me tmse shadi nai kr sakti&quot; uffff very bad acting I must say in that particular scene
Please do come up with a full episode on the Movie &#39;Guide&#39;...,one of the greatest movie made in bollywood history....you often neglect the old gems.

The funniest Indian film which makes me laugh Even tho it was designed as an action adventure film is Tehelka,with corny and cheesy dialogues from stars like Dharmendra ,Naseerudin etc.
Who was the directors who approved those horrible scenes. They deserved awards &amp; respect for their contributions to Indian cinema.
KRK&#39;s deshdrohi doesnt count as film ..
If you look closely the so called overacting is very similar to some good acting by top actors. But when you look unattractive, your slight overacting which might be required for commercial cinema would be looked at in a funny way. The film critics should try acting in a commercial movie and then they would know
Josh e javani movie... Prakash I ❤️Rekha....I ❤️ Rekha 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
“Why he isn’t he taking workshops on acting” ROFL 😂😂

Dude you talk a lot.
You earned my subscription. Well entertaining. Good work.
List is incomplete without a Salman Khan movie
Try to watch balakrishna movies . Supposedly Telugu film industy Michael Jackson
How can you forget hritik roshan movies! All of them are overacted! The absolute gem is main prem ki Deewani hoon!....the whole film is cringe!
Can&#39;t watch anymore.enough for today
Rakesh bedi would have been cursing himself for acting in that movie
Dev aanand was a stock of laugh before as well as in any era he was not legend
Happens often in  Bollywood
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>I saw this Josh e jawani movie years ago...I thought it was a cheap late 80s or early 90s song...I loved this ek do teen chaar song...my childhood song ^^^Check out that song!!!! You saved my life dude!!
if only he could be speechless
I was expecting &quot;mai prem ki deewani hoon&quot; !
I wasn&#39;t sure whether Bunty Bedi loves Rekha or Rakesh Bedi..... 🙊
Fucking funny
Plane me kaun phone par baat karta hai?

We all use the expression “oh I could have done that so much better” at some point in our lives. I think that jail scene with dev anand’s son is the worst thing I have ever seen. I swear I could probably acted that scene much better than him atleast 😂😂😂
Shah rukh khan in recent past
Rajesh Khanna paad
Never heard  single name amongst the list 🙄🤔🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=282">4:42</a> &quot;plane pe bateien karte  karte .logoki chikhe and plane crush.&quot; It was freaking hilarious.
Last wala legendary tha😂😂😂
The list was hilarious. But I believe Bollywood has lots of such scenes which may require a series on this type of videos
Dev Anand is overrated.
UDYA CHOPRA ki qurbani yaad kr lo...
99% Indian movies are over acting.....second there is no acting, just looks

Baap re baap itni Khatarnak overacting ya phir ye Kaho acting ka na aana Kyu Bani ye filme 😂😂😂
We know fardeen Khan is a bad actor but that scene is not that badly enacted
Omg, i can&#39;t believe it
You missed every srk performance.
Becharo ! I feel sorry for you guys ! You have to watch and go through these crappy movies to give us these hilarious mocumentaries ! Kaise dekh lete ho yaar ?? Dimag ka to bina doodh ke dahi ho jayega !
Amir Khan&#39;s performance in Dhoom-3, Mela and recent Blockbuster Thugs of Hindostan.
Sunil Anand and Salman Khan&#39;s acting is very similar. That furniture scene is the best example of this.
Hahahaha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=284">4:44</a> plane pe network abhi nahi milta, 2001 Mei kaise tha😂

You missed Hum Saath Saath Hai
What happened to the Bolly classic &#39;Mela&#39;? The performances were absolutely Oscar-worthy!
The fardeen Khan scene wasn&#39;t that bad to be honest

हिँदी नहीँ आती क्या हरामखोर
The one who always look for a mistake in someone will never be satisfied. If there is something perfect, they tends to find some mistakes anyhow.

Fardeen Khan was not that bad.He was very talented.Few other mentions include Akshay Khanna,Raghubir Yadav,Sonu Sood,Sanjay Suri,Raj Zutshi etc.<br>These are unsung heroes or actors in Bollywood&#39;s recent past.Far better than today&#39;s bodybuilders turned actors.
Lol
thought your voice is good...you look far more adorable...
I like the job ur doing but i would love it if u had taken the overacting scenes from successful movies rather than from flop movies. Like Kareena in KKKG.
Love your voice and the way of narrating the story... Awesome...!!! Just subscribed 👍
😂 funny

Hello music at the start of the video title?  Thank you

Good content and great presentation. You certainly have a great command on English language which makes the presentation very appealing
I laughed so hard from 1.44 onward scene
Fardeen wlaa bekar tha
Every actor has his decade and his/her acting has been adapted for that decade unless that actor manage to adapt themselves according to demand of fans of that decade
😂😂 cartoon hain aadhe se jyada 😂😂
You missed the Faisal Khan in &quot;Aur Chand Bhujh Gaya&quot; . The milestone.
Bad choice of selecting movies...
Devanand is shit. Who the fuck talks on phone during flight? Illiterates
Bollywood me chutiyo ki kami ni hai 80 overacting krte ghumte hai aur super star bhi hai
The master of all overacting is shah rukh khan acting in the prison scene in Ram jaane and in darrr also some scenes of deewana
Fart hahaha
fardeen acting is good not bad
Hum sath sath hain.. Entire movie was over
&quot;✈  crash&quot;😂😂😂😂

I expected the entirety of mein prem ki dewaani hoon and deshdrohi on this. And gunda. And basically any fardeen khan movie (except no entry). Especially prem aggan. And also expected tum mere ho.
fardeen ka scene to a66a tha
Just pick up any Dev Anand movie, especially the movies he made during later part of his life..... And you will have non stop comedy.
i don&#39;t think devanand is a gd actor ever
It&#39;s not josh aey.. It&#39;s pronounced joshey جوش اے جوانی read as جوشے جوانی
Fardeen is good here!
The movies with not a single moment without over acting<br>Me prem ki diwani hu<br>Kabi khushi kabi gam<br>Kuch kuch hota he<br>Hum saath saath hain
Dev Anand and last one was hilarious..😂😂😂😂😂😂

I think you didn&#39;t watch South Indian movies 🤣🤣
Dude you sound like Fardeen Khan...! 😂😂
Mad in india
yes he deserves Oscar magar haat main nahi gaand main
How can you forget karle pyaar kar le? 😂😂
Buddy !! Why your videos always target bollywood ?? Make something on hollywood , there are plenty of such hilarious things in their movies too !! All these movies  are a decade old and were a flop at box office thus forgotten and unknown ! Try making videos on embracing what good we have instead of what already is ignored by all.
People in India Pakistan shit on the roof tops and shit on roads, dirty bastards
Shut up fool with your FAKe western accent hahaahahahahahahahahahah
Shifu means Master in Chinese... its not a name stupid..😂😂😂😂
Srk is Hijra
Can you figure it out  Hollywood&#39;s​ Biggie&#39;s overacting moments, or you simply aren&#39;t bothered !!
Love at time square 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
bas bhai ye sab dekhne k pahle main andha kyu nai ho gaya..itna talent..meri to aankh me ansu aa gaye..
Overacting baat chal rahi then hw can u forget SRK n KRK... they are masters in overacting😅😅😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=268">4:28</a> sweety darlings expression PRICELESS😂
Sunil aanand aur salman khan acting me bilkul ek level par hai
Missing Akshay kumaar in once upon time in Mumbai 2
Plane crash😂
Annoying voice
what about mithun chakraborthy, jackie shroff, all shits of bollywood. to be honest this dev anand, rajesh khanna, manoj kumar, rajendra kumar and many more were in the beginning era of the bollywood and it was very new thing to the people of india, thats y they got fame otherwise they do shit only in the name of acting. Still now 70% of the indian citizen are of lower class who doesnt know enough about the acting skills etc, so nothing can be expected from them, n that is the reason that even shitty movie earns a lot. just show them some dink chik, nanga naach, some flying auto rickshow action scene, salman khan or akshay kumar and dark comedy double meaning language and thats it, movie will make box office hit.
Actually the last one was a lot less ridiculous than the rest.
Fart scene of Rajesh khanna 😂😂😂
Wtf
My head is hurting
&quot;Main Prem ki deewani hoon&quot; <br>the ultimate overacting saga
😂😂😂😂😂
waves of cringe linger over my body yuuuk
A very B LIST  LIST.
KRK performance in &quot;Deshdrohi&quot; needs your attention please make a video on that 🤣
I&#39;m procrastinating at work while watching this. I just lost my breath laughing
Lol!!
Did u really really watched all that crap??
And ya you must make a video on the worst horrible work of our so called stars in their old age like rajesh khanna, feroz khan, dharmendra, dev anand etc it was like they are taking some revenge by making, producing, directing and acting such horrible movies in 90s
I think this list could be filled by all films acted and directed by dev anand in late 80s and 90s. All the movies were shit full of foreign locations foreigner characters which was like a shadow of his films of stardom period. And ofcourse these films have worst fashion sense also. You can make video on worst and best fashion sense of actors and actresses
I have always found dev anand as a shitty actor even in his &quot;prime&quot;.
salman in most of his films from 1997 to 2010.he acted like a cartoon.hahahahahahha
Why don&#39;t you join and teach Bollywood about filmmaking, acting and everything related to it
OK PEOPLE DIe stuggle to get a platform t show the actiing skill.....lucky people star sons gets it n  ruins it ccmpletly
Hilarious! 😂😂😂
Worst actor in the history dev anand .... Na shakal na akal na acting ....
why dont u make a movie as a director and find some zero mistakes.
It was excellent method acting from dev anand and rajesh khanna
Parkash i love rekha i love rekha  jabbardast acting hai yaar
Kareena kapoor  in main prem ki diwani hoon and kabhi khusi khabi gam

where is &#39;Ramjaane&#39; of Shahrukh khan..?<br>its a case study of over acting..!<br><br>- Akshay Kumar for Mr. and Mrs.<br> Khiladi.<br><br>- Kajol in K3G
It&#39;s not Josh A Jawani, it&#39;s Josh e jawani<br>😂 😂
Mai prem ki deewani hu deserves an Oscar for overacting
Yahi to parampara hai na!!!!!
Paana chaata hu ..Paana chaata hu ...😂😂😂😂
agree with all of the picks except the Fardeen Khan one. Its your bias against his abilities as an actor which makes you see that scene as cringy. I thought it was a pretty normal scene, the one you showed...
Even i love rekha
Madarchod hindi filmon ki commentry english mein kar raha hai...dev anand ki acting ko que karne wale chutiye tu narak mein jayega jise kuch nahi aata
Amisha patel in ap mujhe ache lagne lagay

I never knew these films even exist 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Are you recording with a 150/-rs head phone. You proved you are an Indian.
NCS ROCKS! If u knw what I mean
All Indians movies are overacting
I think only Amitabh Bachchan maintained his acting skills from start of his career to till now ...
abhishek bacchan ki filmy kyu chod di..
aisi filmy kab release hoti hai..shayad mangal grah par hoti hogi
lawde tera awaj nai sunana hai..
You forgot &quot;Main prem ki deewani hoon&quot; 😑😕The height of overacting in that stupid movie was intolerable.
Baapre and what about legends like himesh bhai, krk chutiya and balatkari baba shaitan
you missed Siddhart  mallothra movies.
last wala actor kon tha..Konsi bedi ka aulad? Dev anand hamesha hi khrp/over acting krta tha it just got noticed later
Govinda, Salman Khan, Mithun and Varun Dhawan are masters in overacting
Plane crash
Try watching “Sanam harja” and see the acting there!😂
Laila khan
Ohkay.. So everonye is talking abt either KRK or Hrithik. But no one can beat Amir Khan&#39;s performance in Tum Mere Ho..
Bollywood is so disappointing on many fronts.
I only know jaanashen out of these movies..
I think u missed Kareena and Hritik&#39;s acting in Main Prem ki Deewani Hoon🤣
Srk ramjane chahat AK cctc
Indian films r troll to the whole world lol mostly based on overacting

I like jammy he is so cute❤️
Dev Anand son is a sasta version of amir Khan.
You forgot  Prem agan
Voice-over here is quite similar to JASPRIT BUMRAH&#39;S voice!
varun dhawan bakwas all film
Your video will be better if you stop your Indian accent English commentary which is annoying and ugly to hear. No foreigner is going to watch your video which is Hindi. You should do your commentary in Hindi
Subscribed your channel.<br>I think you can save a lot of time with quality. infotainment<br>Thanks.
I look frwd to ur videos and they r crisp and to the point.... Keep up the gd wrk
Suraj ,,mujhe wo hasiin dard de do Suraj 🤔

Dev anand reminds me of tommy wiseau the room

Rajesh khanna frequently put his hand on face because that was his facepalm moment. Regretting doing that film by seeing that lady&#39;s acting skill lol
Hindi me nahi bol sakta kya
Ap shayd jani dushman,prem agan bhul gye ho...Or b bht h
your list contains unknown actors apart from fardeen khan. dev anand and rajesh khanna were legends in their time. good to see big stars in videos like this like for example salman khan in hello brother
I was expecting solmen Khan lol
please make top 10
Jimmypant bhai. May be you skipped Kareena Kapoor in Khushi
The last one, SRK, nahi, KRK&#39;s acting hero
I an describe all bollywood films I 2 words onlt &#39; love , and revenge or action and romance .there are no other emotions rather than anger and love
I can&#39;t stop laughing😂😂😂
Losers 🤪
We have a bhojpuri song --&quot; raat Diya buta ke piya Kya Kya Kiya &quot; look at dance steps of Pawan Singh..pls make some video regarding this bullshit song
Fardeen Khan in Janasheen shouldn’t be on this list
Last one was owsum.. paana chahta hun ... crying.. breaking walls...
varun in judwa 2
Tina kyu bolte Ho...seedhe point pe aao..commentary mat karo🙂
Nice video bro.. Just loved watching the over actings, infact no acting at all.. He he
How can you forget Salman khan in hello brother and aamir khan in mela?
No Hope
man stop watching these bullshit movies.
Yar tum thora kam bolo tb dekhne me or b maza aaega
Obviously... The list  was incomplete without fardeen 😂
You forget every hindi film post 2004. They are all rubbish
Oh God... x_x
I expected a full video about kareena kapoor😂😂😂
Dev Anand is a great actor but after 1990s.......no comments.
You use hindi films for your videos with English commentary, really doesn&#39;t made for each other and your narration is very serious... The language just don&#39;t connect if you are making fun of a hindi film scene. Use hindi... Just an advice..
Twinkle Khanna mela
I love your voice man!❤️
I love Rekha ❤️
For first 15 years, this was Shah Rukh Khan’s standard of acting in almost every movie. He has got retrained only in last 10 years.
Can you do a video to troll MTV reality shows, like top 10 stupidest moments in MTV Roadies, or Splitsvilla or something similar?
Main usse khona nahi <b>shakes head yes</b> paana chata hu
Here are some suggestions for your video. Idk whether you have already made them or not.<br>1. Top Bollywood cult movies.<br>2. Top Bollywood non mainstream movies<br>3. Bollywood movies that has inspired hollywood<br>4. What is the future of Bollywood. Is there a chance that art movies make a comeback?<br>5. Why Bollywood never makes realistic movies?<br>6. Why Bollywood is all about good looks and glam sham , and not about real talent? <br>7. Why Bollywood is scared of experiments?<br>8. When will the Kapoor family come to an end?
I must say that your channel is SO underrated! Keep up the good work :)
Please make video in Hindi
Fardeen can act tho😦
Bhai English sikhne ki tips dedo
are bhai jinko hum actor nahi samjte woh chahe jaisi acting kre..jaise josh e jawani <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=330">5:30</a> why would we care about him. aur tum to use famous kr rhe ho   Kya yr
Why am i even watching this and torturing myself !!!
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXqaXurOpcU&amp;t=116">1:56</a> wo lambe baalo wala soch Raha hai ki ye kya chutiyapa Kar Raha hai
Ajay Jadeja in Khel
How much time you wasted by watching these movies? : )
How can you forget the debut movie of fardeen Khan ... Prem agan????
bro make next on Most underrated comedy movies of bollywood <br>put Dhundte reh jaoge and pyar ke side effects
No honorable mentions? ☹️
You got a like for exploring &quot;Josh e Jawani&quot;
Paana chahta hu Paana chahta hun paana chahta hu 😂😂😂
Sooryavansham.....how can you leave this masterpiece out?
Hey, Fardin Khan didn&#39;t actually deserved that place in the list.
Hay &#39; Main pram ki dewani hun why u forget ?
I lost it when he said &quot;Ahh! Plane Crash&quot; 😂😂😂😂
Fardeen K. wasn&#39;t that bad in the scene. I think the director n the editor also need to be blamed for such scenes.
that farting scene😂😂
why is nobody talking about the Khan&#39;s who are horrible actors except Amir who is a gem to the Indian cinema,but Srk and Salman, 1).Salman was always a terrible dancer  and everybody knows that, and sucks at acting and how can u forget to mention Shah rukh Khan&#39;s overreacting in his movies which is too much that must be why his movies can&#39;t be watched until u are fed up with his overreacting that is why I think he should start to act like a natural born actor and not someone who is forcing himself to act, just watch his duplicate and more movies of his with so much overreacting. that is my opinion,no hate and yes whatever an actor they are and I really appreciate the fact there are many Indian&#39;s who love them,no matter how terrible actors they are...
<b>I can&#39;t believe the Rajesh Khanna portion</b> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Where is Salman khan??
Watch new marathi movie trailer nude
Salman khan acting was not good in that new movie with that Chinese actress his crying looked like he was making fun
Another great video dude. Couldn’t stop lafing on few of them.<br><br>Btw do a video ranking the Khiladi films from Akshay. That will be worth a watch.
video ka to pta nhi bt bhai apki English sun kar dil khush ho jata hai
Mummy nahi rahi sweety darling..haha 😅plane crashhhh
Bollywood ka sb se <b>Chutiya</b> actor tha <b>Rajesh Khanna</b>
Don&#39;t be over smart. They are legend. Their acting is relevant or they performed according to the time and space of the society. Your videos will also become rubbish after 50 to 100 year beacuse it  will become irrelevant with time. Judging those movies based on todays fact  and technology will<br> be absolutely rediculous. Making a movie is very tough task in the world. No movies can be made perfect by all angles like script, cinematography, camera movements, story telling,direction,edit,music,title,etc. I suggest you should make a short movie will know the obsticles and how hard is to produce a movie. It is easy to critize a movie or it is easy to complain or find mistakes in a movie but every movie is made with hard labour and no one in the world whether a producer or a director will want to make a flop movie. Please show some respect because words are bitter than action.
You missed varun dhavan in judwa2(almost his evry movie)
Just one querry... how do u get courage to watch such movies...??? 🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂
You forgot Salman Khan for his consistency of putting just one expression his whole movies
Bollywood means  fuck off
Bhai itne chutiyapa wali acting toh yahi log karte hain
bhai hindi me video hota to aur maza ata dekhne me
Dude u forgot Leave...
Gadgets 2 use ka intro chura Liya tu khud chor hai be dusre Ko kya bolta hai
This is nice but i think u shud put some new movies so that the younger (some of these movies r just too old! 😋) generation of viewers can relate to and the new gen actors can learn a lesson. Hw abt some popular stars - salman ( hum dil de chuke sanam climax) , srk ( has many to his credit) , katrina ( more lyk under acting)... etc. Sonu nigam ... himesh....and  such &quot;wana b actors&quot; with no skills.
Man, those fart sounds ...hahaha, brilliant
😂😂
police commissioner in film officer , legend KRK is desh drohi missing
inme overacting kaha hai be
Do you watch all the movies you feature in videos... ?
Bhai agar hindustan ki baat kar rha h to hindi m hi bol liya kr
You forgot most of Salman Khan performances. Also at least some performances of SRK should have also been included.
Where is Tiger Shroff in ll his movies tbh 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
See the Fardeen Khan&#39;s first film...Prem agan I think...so worse acting, especially dialogue delivery...<br>Also, how can anyone forget Kareena Kapoor in her earlier films like Khushi, K3G, mujhse Dosti karoge, Main Prem ki deewani (in this Hritik too), etc.
In 90s Dev shab was lost out his mind
Janasheen was a movie?
Master was a mind blaster
Fardeen was good..
TRP&#39;S Sabse bakwaas video hain yeh !
That is not hilarious!!<br>That&#39;s just how Fardeen acts
CHANDAAL,JALLAD,YAMRAJ,GUNDA,SHAPATH,ZEHRILA
How do you get the stamina to watch all this bakwaas? I am sure you are truly dedicated to your list... Hats off to your work/list
Plane crash :p
1.28😂
Missing SRK from Don 2.
Bhai tu film direction me kyo luck aajmata apna
The cringe is strong with this one
You should also make a video on greatest acting moments in Bollywood. How about that? For example: Shahid Kapoor&#39;s monologue in Haider, any Naseeruddin Shah&#39;s scene in A Wednesday, or Amitabh Bachchan&#39;s character teaching Michelle her first word &#39;Water&#39; in Black etc.
Make a video on Worst villains of indian cinema..
hey man pls upload new video &quot;Upcoming brilliant masterpieces of Indian Cinema&quot; including &quot;Omerta&quot;
oh man did u watch all these movies ,I really feel pity for u but really nice work man
faltu bakwass
Dharmendra in loha
2.45 lady just farted
Man!!! The things you have to watch for the sake of this channel. I feel sorry for you 😂😂
Unsubscribed your channel, poor selection.
Celina was bullshit fardeen is awesome than varun dhaean and all
How cld frgt shardha Kapoor in ek taah villain
You missed Varun Dhawan in judwaa 2
Fardeen was not bad in that video.
Dev anand ka to aisa nahi laga matlab bhai kuch bhi aur Aditya chopra varun dhawan ye sab kahan hein
Make a video on best war films in Bollywood
What about overacting in main Tera hero
Supperb video... Talented bro
Awesome farts
Awesome Farta
youtube need a Ha Ha react
Sometimes even if he is seriously praising someone i think he is being sarcastic and when he is being sarcastic i think he is serious so damn confusing😅😂 any way his work is praiseworthy
You guys forgot Varun Dhawan
Akshay shilpa and Suniel shetty in DHADKAN were thr epitome of overacting
Your V.O. sort of ruins the impact the scenes would’ve otherwise created. Please don’t use so much of V.O. during the scenes?
How can you forget Varun Sir 😂
How can you forget the greatest cinematic gem ever &#39;Deshdrohi&#39;? That movie is a cult starring the legendary movie star KRK who deserves an Oscar Award for such an unbelievable performance. I bet Leonardo Di&#39;Caprio&#39;s &#39;Revenant&#39; is nothing infront of Deshdrohi.<br>The legend will be remembered forever. <br>This my tribute to him 🖕
Rajesh Khanna might be doing face palm due to absolutely shit acting by the actress in Wafaa. But you never know, she might actually be doing fart bombs on the set!!
dont u agree guys but some of those movies were nice
hahaha
😁😁😁😁😁
Make a part 2 .. it was hilarious..
Hindi bol le
Dev anand acting was hilarious😂😂😂 and the girl&#39;s reaction...i mean wtf😂😂
Varun Dhawan in all of his films.. I haven&#39;t seen a hero who overacts as much as him..
i love rekha....me kya karun😁😁😁😁😁
Good content man.. Please make a video on best indian tv drama like kuch rang pyar ke aise bhi on sony tv, sasural genda phool, meri bhabhi, on star plus.. Tv serial which had some sensible story line, relatable to audiences, good cast, great acting and good direction.. And which were not long lasting but were telecasted for a limited time and ended well..
Aap KRK(Deshdrohi), Sonu Nigam(Jaani Dushman) aur Hrithik Roshan (Main prem ki deewani hoon) bhool gaye Anmol bhai
bhai waiting for part 2
WTF
Ary bhai english mat bol yar plz

Can you please talk less and get to the point real quick ? ( All your videos ) . Otherwise all great.
भाई आप ये सारी फ़िल्में देखते हो?? बहुत जिगरा है भाई।
.Plz come back  Frdeen sir
Your voice is the star! ❤ Steals the show! ❤
Plane main phone per baat karogey to plane crash hoga hin .
You chose wrong clip of fardeen khan he wasn&#39;t that bad in that scene. There are lot of worst performance scenes in Prem Agan.
You should leave these b grade cinema. Nobody takes them seriously and nobody watches them. You should have mentioned A List actors overacting moments. That would been great!
Bro I am again requesting bring back previous intro music...
Last one tho😂😂
Thnk god have just watched one.. Janasheen.. Songs achchhe the by the way uske.. Baakiyo ka naam hi aaj suna bc😂😂
dev anand was a shitty actor.
Shah Rukh Khan - Pretty much every movie barring a few like Swades
1. Hrithik Roshan in Main Prem Ki Dewani hoon..<br>2. KrK in Desh Drohi..<br>3. Amisha Patel in Aap Mujhe Achey Lagne Lage..<br>4. Salman Khan in most of his movies <br>5. Sonam Kapoor in most of her movies <br>6. Sonu Nigam in(all time worst movie) Jaani Dushman..<br>7. Varun Dhawan in Dishoom..<br>AND EVERYONE IN HOUSEFUL 1 2 &amp; 3..
Deepika padokone is padmaavat !
Hahahaha the farting noise intrigued a rolling belly laughter man....fucking awesome
I literally just came back from dramatics practice after hearing a shitload of &quot;y&#39;all can&#39;t act&quot;. <br>Honestly feeling SO much better
Wtf😂😂😂😂💯💯💯
Bollywood=Shit
🤣🤣
you should make a video about the speeches of rahul gandhi 😂😂
Rajesh Khanna and Dev Anand we’re past their primes in the 80s.
how could you miss main prem ki deewani Hoon? Each and every character in that was high on drugs while shooting it 🙀🙄
Wao good 1
This channel is like India&#39;s &#39;watch mojo&#39;.. Very good effort brother.. <br>explaining things loud and clear!
thanks... buddy
you must see the dev anand film “sachche ka bolbala” <br>The famous airport attack scene &amp; dev saabs performance is outstanding. The way he says “Koi... aataaankwadi hai shayad” <br>😄
I didn&#39;t find fardeen over the top.
Ohhh my God.. Shock<br>Shocked first by watching legends r done these kind of movies n second laugh a lot
No Srk in the list???<br>Overacting ka king to wahi hai
Where is Arjun kapoor ? He is overacting ki dukan. Where is siddharth malhotra in bar bar dekho? Katrina kaif in almost ALL movies ?!! We need PART 2 😂😂😂😂
Ranchi se plane par lauttte waqt hawa me hi mujhse baat,ek dhamaka,logon ki cheekhopukaar.....aur Plaaaaayyyyynneeee Crashhhhh

Bhai <br>I have just 1 Question .. you watched this all movies ??? <br>Because after this video <br>Himmat hi nahi ki yeh movie galti se bhi dekhun
This list wasn&#39;t adequate 😑 Some of the most overacted scenes are missing and some scenes like Fardeen&#39;s are unnecessarily added 😡
Your content is so great honestly ! You deserve million subscribers
why fardeen khan..? he was convincing in his role...
why fardeen khan..? he was convincing in his role...
Make opposite version of this video

Fardeen was not bad
