BOYCOTT <b>Druggie</b>  BULLIWEED😬  , we don&#39;t pay for their drugs !<br>We made them superstars but nobody from these superstars uttered a single word for Justice for Our Dearest Sushant 💗<br>👉watch only pirated versions of all movies of these druggies from now onwards.<br>Don&#39;t go in theatres to pay for their drugs . Show them the power of Sushant fans👍
Sushant came to us  from FUTURE !<br>He was way ahead of us all in every aspect.<br>WE were( are)  too ignorant to appreciate , understand Him.<br>I can imagine how he might be feeling interacting with low I.Q. people around Him. That might be a  reason of him being introvert or shy.<br><br>We are unlucky to loose  one in a million Gem , due to our own fault.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforsushantsinghrajput">#JusticeForSushantSinghRajput</a>
Who all was here to watch 100% Sushant only<br>👇

Not all of SSR films flopped , he had major hits like chhichore,  Ms dhoni, Kedarnath, Kai po che <br>So why on earth are people blaming his death on nepotism and him not getting many projects. <br>Hollywood has actors that have humble origins and some make it big irrespective of having a couple setbacks <br>If SSR had depression, it must have been for a more private reason<br><br>SSR was a fantastic actor and it&#39;s a shame what happened .
Miss you very much my dear fan 😔😔❤️❤️
Miss you😭😭
We will miss u Anni❤️
Come back yaar, please come back...... 🙏😭
We&#39;ll miss you anni....Rest in peace 🌹🌹🌷🌷

Sushant gave up his life to save Disha Salian. Who does that in today&#39;s world? Some people robbed him of his money, took advantage of his simplicity and then when the iron was hot, they killed him
justice for him !!!!
Time to boycott Ranveer Singh Movies!!!
Only real fans of Sushant Singh Rajput will do like here

Audiences nowadays will not buy a ticket for themselves and watch a film for 2(1/2) hours or 3 hours unless there is some kind of hype or mystery(hysteria) created around the film and unless the film will draw yr attention and excite you within to watch the film before it releases in the form of teasers, trailers.
Films of today&#39;s times need to have flaws(a few plotholes) in their storyline, screenplay and dialogues in order to become successful and so that the audience can understand what is happening on the screen and relate to it.
Sushant sir love you ❤blockbuster
