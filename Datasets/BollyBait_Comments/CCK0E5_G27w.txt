If she was born to an actress then it&#39;s not her fault . She is very hardworking . And if you will see her recent movies then she has improved a lot . Please don&#39;t hate her .
she is cute and graceful like deepika padukone..

Janhavi Kapoor you are looking so beautiful and so sexy I love very much
Whteva leftover we have from our breakfast,we put it on our face was said by Anjelina jolie, I swear, cuz I&#39;m her fan, why bollywood star kid literally copying everything they speak
I actually find Janhvi quite pleasing and a good actress (unlike some of the other girls of her generation). But I am always bothered that these celebs are never more open about certain things. She says that their mom used to give them oil massages, fruit face masks etc., but what about all the plastic surgeries? Janhvi&#39;s nose is clearly so different than it used to be, and she definitely has lip injections and other procedures, like face lightening. So does her sister, maybe even more than her. And Janhvi is a Nykaa ambassador. I see none of those products here, and she always talks as if those products are all she needs in her life. When it&#39;s clear she never uses cheap stuff, let&#39;s be real. Maybe other people will get fooled by this, and I know that many actors do these things, but sometimes it&#39;s ridiculous and it rubs me the wrong way. What example does this set for younger girls? What message this conveys? That without money and nepotism, you can&#39;t get to Bollywood and on Vogue covers.
She looks Beautiful Stunning and very lovely Janhvi Kapoor ❤️❤️ Love U lot Janhvi ❤️❤️💘💘💞💞💕💕💖💖💋💋💋💋
India people no longer wearing saris . ???please stop copying the Europeans!!!
Disgusting
I love Janvi 💗
Janhvi like nyka products

Nice dress
Nice
I love you 😘♥️♥️
She is so fake and undeserving. Look this has gone too far. If you didn&#39;t earn your spot you shouldn&#39;t have it. And dude her face is complete plastic and why does she always act coquettish.
She is missing her mother
She has cute face just like me 🥰🥰

Arishfa and mohak Narang are also in vogue
Who is janhavi Kapoor ?
Janhvi is very beautiful and kind
डांसर है स्मार्ट मे चेक नहीं हुई है

Why is she here on vogue? Why isnt manushi chillar here? <br>Oh I get it now<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>nepotism</b> and <b>karan johar</b>
She killed her mother along with her Dad. They got 240CR from her insurance. Check out YouTube. Shameless Jhanavi. How could you do that to your mother??
Why not manushi and this janvi????😂😭
I know you miss ur mom each and every time..no world in the world can take the place of mother even god too
Red carpet m kitni. Bar gye ho 😂😂😂😂
Again a dumbo
How can anyone forget their fav shades ...just peculiar
en logoke muhu pe hagne ko vi jinehi karta,eye shochkar ke meye meti tatti enke upar waste karu !!
I have beautiful hand embroidery clutches, bags, customise mask, designer mask, visit my channel u will love it
Just look at her face. How can she be in vogue except for the fact that her mother was talented? My god.
Mediocre looks , nepotism product...
&quot;Old Hollywood-ish&quot; ??? WTF. She deserves to be kicked out.
Super dislike
She on Vogue. Vogue has gone down from its standards or what.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrPuiMFiC9g">https://youtu.be/PrPuiMFiC9g</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCK0E5_G27w&amp;t=42">0:42</a> &quot;Whatever leftover we have from breakfast we would put on our face.&quot; I was like 🤔 Poha??!!....Why?! Then she clarified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCK0E5_G27w&amp;t=46">0:46</a> &quot;Like Strawberries&quot;. 😅😂
She is looking gorgeous and pretty despite of not have a  good acting.  She is beautiful in film industry  and it is true u mean or not
What are her achievements for such fame??
Even if she looks average what is your problem. Cant you appreciate average looking girls.
Seriously Guys ! What&#39;s the f*****g problem do you have?<br>Why you have to troll her all the time . Is she the only star kid in bollywood?  No , right. Then stop doing these things. <br>YOU DON&#39;T KNOW HOW THEY FEEL OF YOUR COMMENTS,  DON&#39;T DO THIS TO ANYONE! !!
Ye shri devi ki beti na hoti toh actor ni bnti she not gud like shri devi
Why vogue India is always running behind starkids
They do not deserve to come on vogue
I dislike this video...
No offense she can even be equal to Kendall Jenner&#39;s toe nails
Boycott  nepotism
Get a dog and do some make up on it some shit surgeries and even it will look.<br>But jhanvi is still average. <br>I&#39;d look better even after only wearing a mascara and a gloss
These asshole like nepo kids get to do Vogue. <br>Take instead kriti Kharbanda far more talented and beautiful then this Buffalo
Vogue india is shit
People here blaming Vogue for giving nepo kids a chance to be on Vogue. Dumb people..Vogue is a business. It will show people who sell ok?? In India only Bollywood sells. No matter what you people say here..you are the ones who give the Ananyas and Alias and Sonams all the attention in the world. Vogue is just using that. Don&#39;t want unfair? Stop following these people everywhere! Insta Youtube..just don&#39;t pay them attention. Vogue ka baap bhi inhe attention nei dega phir!!
Expression less Actress👎👎👎
Ban her please...she is so ugly it is almost painful to watch her
Inhe kaise lgta hoga sb mila h phle se..bt jo hme mehnt kr k paise milte h uska baat alg hoti h..jb phle se na ho Kuch .chahe km amount mile  khooshi hoti h dil se
Bollywood have not natural beauty now all nepotism
i just hate her voice...😤
Ioooool hiiiiii&gt;iiiiiiii
Ballywood ki young  actress janhvi kapoor  so  sweet
Boycott her
Bollywood=nepotism.
This is a sad picture for all of those beautiful and talented actors working their ass of hoping to make it in bollywood but there are some people who doesn&#39;t even deserve this title yet and are appearing on the magazine cover.
Meanwhile Manushi Chhillar, miss world, has never been on the cover of vogue.
She is the best.😍😍😍
Love her.😍😍😍
She is amazing
It’s so easy for her to become a star, get good movies and be in Vogue cover page..... they just have to be born... that’s all the hard work required
Shame shame shame on vogue.... Ugly janhvi kapoor
Money and star kids work...
She&#39;s too young for vogue 😬😬
In other country star kids are not promoted anywhere and not given high importance. <br>Vogue India isn&#39;t respecting true talents.
isko actress kisne bna diya 😀😀😀😀
Even after all that makeup she is so ugly
Nobody:<br>Le janhvi Kapoor : l came I saw I contour ;-)NAYKA
she is beautiful 😍😍
After putting all this things she still look just average girl
Nepotism 😡😡😠😠😠😡😡😡🤒
To all the people coming here after that Nykaaa make up tutorial ,this is her real face skin ,not that
Vogue is also now a shit eating brand
Vogue india has lost all my respect today . I mean seriously 😒🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Not beautiful in se to patani kitni sunder sunder ladkiya padi hain dilli me
What did Janhvi Kapoor do to be interviewed by Vogue India... This Nepo kids who has yet to prove themselves make me sick!
Vouge nepotism true ...huhhhhh
I don&#39;t know why but she looks very ordinary girl to me- Bollywood should give chance to other girls outside of industry !
Favorite lipstick forgot names
Pathetic!!!! She has nothing extraordinary that she is trying to flaunt
Bohat bekar looks h
Not red carpet its ifa or zee awards
Vogue is Nepotism
I am huge fan of nykaa.. in my video most the product i used are from nykaaa... check this out subscribe if you liked it
What&#39;s her achievement?<br>Daughter of Sridevi and bonny Kapoor..<br>Justice for Sushant Singh rajput
Where are the nykaa products omg you are looking very pretty for plastic surgery
Whats the name of the makeup artist ??
So many people here commenting about nepotism but also, most of them get mags and view videos if there are known faces or star kids instead of just plain models with no Bollywood career. Maybe, nepotism is so enriched, its also our own fault. Isn&#39;t it?
Omg who thinks the make up artist looks like mahira khan
A small youtuber here plz subscribe to my channel for amazing content ❤❤❤❤❤

Vogue India is the son of karan johar..
Nepotism presented by VOGUE!
Jauh bgt sama emak nya ya ,emak nya cakep bgt ,anaknya B aja
This Stupid girl always got camera and media around her because of her mother.  <br>She is so stupid that she thought she is beautiful that&#39;s why she is getting all the attention. Oneday, she will realize her mom was 100% right about her. She has no further in acting career. She is like her father, ugly spoiled and talentless. Her father used her mom stardom to make money. Now she is also using her mom stardom to make money. Like father like daughter. The father and daughter both are so disgusting 🤮🤮.
Nepotism rocks
Coronavirus..face touching by makeup artist...brush...how far they are hygienic? Are they safe practice ?
She’s so pretty 💕

Got a glimpse of diamirza.that made the entire video worth watching
She looks like bullshit
🤮🤮🤮
chudail
She is ugly
Seriously why Jhanvi?????  😂😂😂
Age 30 year old beautiful beautiful makeup
Stunning
She seriously look like duck face.
I think Priyanka Chopra has already wore this type of dress. 🤔
She looks like a typical street corn seller.
I love janhvi Kapoor toooo much .. just the way she looks her eyes glitters her smile everything but seriously frankly I used to hate her mom .. that too after too may surgery
What has she done in life to be featured on a Vogue cover?
She looks pretty
Good
janhvi is just attitude girl😑😑
She looks like Shriya Saran.
Jhanvi is so cute and gorgeous
she is looking beautiful
I am biggest fan of janvhi Kapoor 😊
She is ugly,she can&#39;t beat her mother beauty
Janhvi s looking gorgeous she is beautifull this fethery and shiny silver gown is made for her only her look is killing while dressup some i found sri mam in her face and best of luck  Janhvi for your journey may god bless you Dhadak has heartbeat ive to say
greattt
Why are you all being too rude towards her she has also worked hard.If someone will comment you in such manner you will feel bad like that only she also feel bad plzz respect her.
I just dont like janvi kapoor
BAsuuurrriiii.... But dress z awesome
khusi looks more beautiful than Jahnvi
You were looking beautiful without makeup indeed
Did she just said doobaung me in highlighter in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCK0E5_G27w&amp;t=67">1:07</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Favouritism everywhere!
😄😄😄😄
She have beutiful voice
This girl is so basic. Keeping nepotism aside, her sister kushi is better looking and a bollywood material compared to her.
Ugly!!! But better than dumbass suhana
<a href="http://she.is/">She.is</a> pretty 💜😘
😍
She so oxward
Has Karan taken over Vogue?
Looking beautiful
Eye make up looks a bit weird... 😯 something wrong
The dress looks good on her.. undoubtedly
😏her mother is pretty women
Plastic doll
Ugly lady 😠😏😏😏😏😠😠😠😠 ... She iz nt deserv any protocol .👎👎👎👎👎
So overrated.. no offense but really would find better girls in lokhandwala..How can bollywood deny nepotism?😂😂<br>She is average at her best..<br><b>Feminists coming to attack</b> Run!
Her face is gorgeous but her dress though .....looks like a pocha😂
No quality in this girl, All stardom only because of mom otherwise many many more beautiful and talented actresses are waiting for their luck to work some day .
I don&#39;t know y but I don&#39;t like her...I like her sister@kushi more😘😘
Even after getting face surgery she is not at all beautiful. She is a big zero without her surname.
Vogue is promotimg young saleable celebrity kids .first it was only ash and later sonam,priyanka ,jhanavi etc etc would be in line
She is so irritating n fake
She really knows styling...more than Sarah
She is not beautifull
Everybody stop hating her don&#39;t feel bad you all are just jealous if no so stop commenting just imagine ur life with her .  her mom died she is happy for us if I say this to u will u feel good.
Please promote natural skin instead.of making them fairer n layering them with makeup ..please promote natural beauty and talent ..have common women who have done something for society be on Vogue ......high time india promotes natural skin with blemishes and scar marks.......
Vogue lost respect in india...in UK nd US it takes a lot of hardwork nd success to be on the cover of VOGUE.... but sadly  not in my country
U look gorgeous my god!!
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nepotism">#nepotism</a>
Nepotism or whatever.she is a good girl.nobody should judge her.
I love jhanvi

When is the plastic melting :)
I hate janhvi she is not beautiful
She is not beautiful and does not know how to act.....there r many more girl waiting for movie break...she is here bcoz of Sri Devi.......
Hamesha upar ka part dikhati hai
EDIT : PLEASE DO READ THE WHOLE COMMENT . I KNOW ITS A LOT AND I AM SORRY BUT I HAD TO . SO PLEASE READ IT AND MAKE SURE TO LIKE MY COMMENT AND ALSO TELL ME IF YOU AGREE WITH ME .....<br><br><br>Why is everyone just criticising her ?????? Just leave her to live her life !!! Its HER life and she has all the rights to live it the way she wants to ..... And she doesn&#39;t need anyone&#39;s interference !!! And at least she is trying her best .... All you guys talk about is  surgery , her nose , her lips , etc ........ For gods sake , whatever she does and wants to do in her life let her just do it and do not criticize her !!!! And , you guys also say that she is plastic , or she is ugly or blah blah blah ....... BUT if you have to go and watch another sad video about some other girl being criticized because of looks , then you will go and comment saying that &quot;oh she is so beautiful , she is not ugly , she is cute   she is gorgeous , they shouldn&#39;t have called her ugly or criticized her , etc &quot; ...... So before talking about others , please take a good look at yourself and your character and learn to respect and treat others properly with respect and do not criticize them the way you are doing that to Janhvi . The fact remains that everyone is beautiful in their own ways but most people are judged by looks /appearances .  Okay..... you guys are all talking about her surgery and nose , etc . Have you ever wondered if she never done it , you would still be criticising her ???!!! You would have said   &quot; Omg , look at her ,  she is not fit to be in Bollywood , etc , etc ,etc &quot; ..... But now that she made an effort and tried to save herself from all of that criticism , you guys are still criticising her ...... So no matter what she does , you are still not going to be pleased and will still find faults in her and find ways to bring her down. Also especially because she is a star kid , you all are saying that she is only where she is because of her mothers popularity ...Star kids also have a life . Just give them a break  ...... And as for the  media ............... you guys also just find faults in EVERYTHING and all the celebrities ....  They are also humans and  they also need their own space , privacy and freedom to at least step out of their houses in peace without about 100  many cameras just flashing around them or a lot of people screaming their names , or asking them to pose , etc ....... They also have a life , and also an emotion called &quot;anger&quot; ..... And when they do get angry at you guys , you then make a big issue about it ...... Or if they just refuse to take photos , the title for your video becomes    &quot; ----------- throwing tantrums / showing attitude &quot; ..... I mean come on , everyone gets annoyed and especially celebrities because they have a really tiring day and on top of that you guys just irritate them more ..... You guys don&#39;t really notice their good behaviour ,  when they are controlling their frustration , but the moment they lose their temper and let  out their anger and frustration , its a problem for you guys ......  Okay ,let me put it this way , if you were in their place , and you had a busy day , then in the evening you have an event to attend so you are rushing and then the media just takes up your time , you are  bound to get annoyed , then after that , you begin to get ready , you are sitting there your hair is getting done , then your nails , then make up , then getting dressed up ... it is tiring . Then you reach the event , the media is there . There is so much of noise . You go up to take photos , then about 20/30 people are telling you to do all different poses . Now who are you expected to listen to . Then you do the pose that you heard one person say , then the media has another headline that the celebrity ignored some media people . Then eventually after so much of pictures and posing , etc . You go inside for the event . Many hours later ,the event is over and you are really tired and sleepy , and then as you step outside , everyone is just screaming , and then shouting for you , and then asking you to pose ...... You are obviously bound to get angry , then the media has another headline , then they somehow manage to click some bad pictures of you and then again they have a new headline about an embarrassing moment .  And then the same story repeatedly takes place then someday suddenly they make up rumours about you being  in a relationship with a certain person ... You are very angry but you ignore it ,then later on you go for on interview and then the media begins to bombard you with many questions . You answer them and then they begin to ask you about your personal life /relationships ... Its irrational so you do get angry and then give you comment ... And then guess what ? Another headline !!!!! And  these stories continuously take place and the media just get their headlines !!! In short , the media compels the celebrities to lose their temper so when they do , they just get their stories or basically does anything to get stories/headlines . I don&#39;t mean do not do your job . I just mean give them a little of their own space, privacy and freedom to do as they feel like . And don&#39;t always follow them everywhere or be outside their houses . You guys can go to movie promotions , trailer/song launches , events , outside theatres when a new movie gets released , etc . But not always following them around , like pet dogs  to the gym , restaurants , houses , etc . <br><br>I have no hate towards the media BUT I&#39;m sorry . You guys can be annoying at times . Thank you for giving us information about our favorite celebrities but also at the same time  please we want CORRECT information not  wrong ...... You guys can&#39;t just find any celebrity that is looking tired or something and just say that they were drunk . You need to get you facts straight first before jumping to conclusions . <br>..................................................................................................................<br><br>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING TILL THE END . LOVE YOU 😘❤🎁👍
lucky girl
💰 &amp;mind makes man perfect...<br>Dr Zaani...<br>Get one or that&#39;s..pareshani.....

who give a fuck about her...
Why am I even watching this stuff
They are shoving jahnvi kapoor down our throats and throwing her in our faces and I know I can  skip her movies but I wanted to see this vogue shoot but not with her in it
Just one word.. Nepotism
Stunning 💜
Looking beautiful in the outfit
U forget to mention plastic surgery
I love janhvi kapoor
Woww😘😍😍
Music throughout the video.... does anyone know what it is ???
God bless you
no beauty...she was just lucky to get chance in Bollywood because of her mother&#39;s fame
Janhvi all the best for your future films
Gud look jhanvi. Definitely u will come up like ur mom. Love and best wishes
Hindi film industry is ruining with nepotism.  Where are the good talents here
If ur dad or mom is a Bollywood star then you also take the opportunity....
I like her (talk accent)<br>I love her dress
looking so naturally beautiful and lovely Jhanvi is............Doll of Sri G...
She&#39;s  not  beautiful
love you so much jhanvi 😚😚😙😙😘😚
STOP all the Nepotism bullshit, as if you wouldn’t take a great job from your father if he could give it to you???! And as if your father wouldn’t secure you a job if he could? Its sickening how everyone is preaching about these dreamy high morals when everyone, everywhere, including all of you, would do exactly the same thing if you were in their place, this happens on a daily basis to people like us, just in different fields. So don’t give us all that crap .. <br>(Even the fucking hypocrite Kangana who started this whole thing, has hired her sister as her manager!!!! When clearly there are far more experienced managers in the industry) she and all of you need to SHUT THE FUCK UP.
Love the dress
By giving that pose in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCK0E5_G27w&amp;t=123">2:03</a> you cannot become Aishwarya Rai Bachchan ! Badi aayi Aish ke pose ko copy karne wali 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
nepotism...😈😈
sab moey ka kamal hai😏
they are not naturally beautiful...
Nice and who are like her
Manushi shld b there rather than dis plastic girl wid money n surname
Fake
Sorry janvi Kapoor I don&#39;t like you seriously
i love makup
Did she do a nose job????
Janhvi your so beautiful your voice is so nice
I thought she was natural beauty...but then i saw the before pictures...wow big difference. Plastic surgery did her good. If it werent for the parents, the money and the surgery she wont even mske it.
A very normal looking creature!
The Miranda lipstick is from Charlotte till Miranda Kerr lipstick
This is d best dress ever worked on her
utni v aachi nhi lagti ho janvi tum
Beautiful and well made.
Whos ds girl
Not at all beautiful
Wow.... Jahnvi you are my favorite actress and Ishan Khattar is my favorite actor my favorite movie is Dhadak
Why is Vogue promoting this shit?
Nyc
This vedio would not get so many views without that surname... Nepotism making its roots stronger and deeper in India
Iski smile bht cute hai
I like janhvi kapoor
I think she &#39;ll turn into another abhishek bachan
She look like her mother , but khushi is more beautiful than janvi
I don&#39;t like this whatever jhanvi kapoor...only the dress is beautiful..and she doesn&#39;t deserve this dress and is not doing justice with this dress
plastic surgery se hui he ye..baki kuch nyi thi
You look so beautiful u are my favourite actress
&quot;These are my 2 favorite shades&quot; <b>Forgets names</b> :/
Janhvi looks totally gorgeous!!!! You can tell she&#39;s a humble person from watching her videos. And all the people here bsing about nepotism are probably the first ones who go around watching movies from Alia, Varun, Ranbir, kareena, Sonam, Shahid, Sonakshi and etc. So if you don&#39;t wanna see Janhvi then simply don&#39;t fking watch the videos!!
Pretty  janhavi
Iloveughanvi
I don&#39;t find her preety or amazing ..only her acting will tell.
If she&#39;s an ordinary girl..imagine how she&#39;ll look like.  I don&#39;t hate her but I don&#39;t like her either.
She is not at all beautiful, not a heroine material. Just because of sridevi ji,she is getting famous..
Manushi Chillar deserves to be on VOGUE.
so good jhanvi
sooooo many things
Is it she know tamil..i ask bcoz her mother know tamil right
Bollywood industry in the next couple years will be full of nepotism. It already exists but it will become a norm practice. All these children of movie actors from the kapoor&#39;s to the khans will take over making it extremely even more difficult for rest of the world to get in. Bollywood actors that have become world famous celebrities are very hardworking. Giving young people a golden spoon to begin with will not produce or ever level up to the talent bollywood has
This is strange. U get on the cover of vogue and then say &quot;I will prove myself&quot;. Wasnt it the other way around. You prove yourself first and then get on vogue!!!
Me to Itne makeup k koi parri lgu😬😬

VOGUE INDIA-THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH PAD OF STAR-KIDS IN INDIA!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nailing">#Nailing</a> Nepotism.Interestingly,it happens only &amp; only in India &amp; to our utter surprise instead of making efforts towards equalizing things ,of late, the big- wigs of Bollywood happen to take much pride in it!!! Thanks to Hollywood for acting much wisely in this matter.<br>KJo must have been very happy to have finally got a &quot;A MAJOR MAGAZINE COVER???&quot; for promotion of his movies .Of late,this poor fellow must have got exhausted single-handedly dealing wid all d sarcasm &amp; criticism...now atleast DHARMA got someone to share it&#39;s agony.<br>This one&#39;s for INDIA&#39;S ONLY MAGAZINE OBSESSED WID NEPOTISM-Why do u need to sell ur magazine copies for d month of Aug to the masses,the way srk has sponsored his daughter&#39;s cover story, who his just 18 &amp; &quot;yet to make a mark in any field&quot;, we r very sure he will be able 2 pay u much more than what u r gonna earn from selling the Aug edition of ur PRESTIGIOUS MAGAZINE... Unnecessarily, we don&#39;t think so there&#39;s any need for u to compromise wid ur hard earned reputation &amp; be n object of mockery by recording all time low sales...GOOD LUCK FOR D FUTURE &amp; HOPE U MAKE SOME EDUCATED DECISIONS KEEPING IN MIND THE reputation OF UR MAGAZINE...The Indian readers r very wise &amp;  well-informed U can&#39;t at all simply go away  feeding just anything to us...
Y’all say her acting was bad. Like come on people. It’s her first movie. She’s still learning. Give her a chance. She could become better or she could become worse. Not like y’all have done super well at something you’re doing for the first time.
She sounds so much like sridevi.
U lost me at HAIRS
All nepotism
she&#39;s such a queen❤❤❤
Jhanvi u look so beautiful....I bcame ur fan.. ur movie was awsum😘
The dress and hair were beautiful but the fit could&#39;ve been better
MISS U SRIDEVI JI..... AND LOVE U JANVI
She looks gorgeous. With and without makeup,and her dress is just awesome!
Love you jaanvi 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Sri Devi ky  level tak  Nahi  Phanch  sakti kbhi  bhi
Nepotism kaha se ye kuch lagti Hai..... Faltu
Why would I get red carpet ready with an entitled brat who has no experience in cinema?
She z perfect for maid <a href="http://role.no/">role.no</a> look at all
That makeup girl is more beautiful than jhanavi
माँ जाने के बाद नखरे जादा लगने लगे
Such a stunner😍😍
blkul.pyari nhi hy
Itta andhere me kaiku karre makeup?
So ugly dress she had worn....
Vogue India you guys are doing fucking things. How much money do you all charges for doing these!!!?¡? Vouge sucks
She looks stunning!❤️
Sridevi nai manisha koirala ki beti lag rahi ha
Hate her.......
alha ka yi ksa nazaam hy k koi apni life itne enjoy krta hy or koi bychara choti c chotie chez ko bhi tarsta hy why every body nt spend equal life😭😭😭😭😭
She don&#39;t have heroein face
Stop hating on her just cuz she changed her nose its basic human rights if one is uncomfortable with a part of their body they have every right to change it. Just shows ppls mindsets on here it clearly shows that you wouldn&#39;t eveb be accepting of transgender and then they call themselves progressive
Icon❤😍
Gorgeous 👍💋
U ve sensitive look go for art movies u r not like ur mom.u r like smita patil and shabana azami.......
inhone aisa kya ukhada h jo ye vogue ke liye shoot kar rahi h
The best part of jhanvi ...she is pure it reflects in her looks ,speech.she needs to hold on to this, as this makes her stand out.There are many beautiful faces but they don&#39;t appeal, she strikes the cord
She is not beautiful n her acting is very baf but she is famous becoz of her mom,i hate her
I love you janhvi di u r so pretty 😚
she is copy of her mom beutiful diva janvi kapoor😍😍😍😍😗
Nose and lip surgery worked well fr her
I don’t know she is beautiful or not but she doesn’t deserve to be here because she is not a good actress nor she has that influential personality. She has never seen any struggle in life then why we should consider her in Bollywood. Like others I don’t want to see her in any movies further.
Nice
well that little mole on her cheeks just like the little touch of magic...pretty...
She look stunning
after deepika padukone bollywood got it&#39;s another classy actress

much love for janhvi😘😘
Even with all the help she looks basic
Looking gorgeous 😍
Janhvi is so beautiful in this dress. She looks like one of those hollywood heroines from 30s and 40s..
<b>Vogue India</b> has been a flag bearer of nepotism from the very beginning.  I have nothing against these beautiful kids of famous stats but ethically it can never be correct to let stardom take over so many talented new face who deserve to be here. Now in fact the talented ones don&#39;t. Coz Vogue India has shown how it&#39;s all about being flashy n not ur talent. Such a shame on Vogue. <br>Unsubscribing Vogue rn.
Janhvi looking so Gorgeous, beautiful, fabulous expression... Unique...👍
Hair style awsum
Aghhmm NEPOTISM
bina mekup ke hi achi lag rahi thi
My favourite  u r awesome
Isko heroin kon bnaya .....yaaakk
If people say because of their star parents they get such chance easily. Only chances they can get easily, not the success. There are many star kids they tried their luck in industry and got failed. So, nepotism doesn&#39;t work always.
Kallon ko Gora banta dekhi hun par goron ko kala banta pehli baar dekhri hoon....😊😊😊
Princess charming lg rhi hai jahanvi
Wow she was remembering <a href="http://her.mom/">her.mom</a> Shree, how she used to take care of her daughters. Jhanvi must be missing her mom
She s very lucky to be a Kapoor. <br>Let&#39;s see her luck on Bollywood.
nepotism rules in india
kya kabaadan c dress hai ye celebs b na kuch b pehnte hai mtlab kuch bhi😂😂😂
Love her so much. Innocent yet sensible and strong ❤️
♥♥Elegant &amp; Stunning! .♥♥
Janhvi 😘😘😘
JHanvi you looked beautiful, and you have proven yourself to be a good actress, yes there;s a lot to learn, but you did well. As Jhanvi yourself, and SriDevi&#39;s daughter too. All the best. :)
I love jaan looking so beautiful pretty awesome gorgeous bright future janhvi all the best love u loving sister god blessing u
so so so nice 😇😇😇😇
Soo beautifull nicr ❤❤😍😍😍😘😘😗😗
The only beautiful thing in this video was that pretty dress...sry but this girl is not pretty as her mother...she is only here just because of her family..... totally nepotism 😑😑😑😑😑😑
lovely jhanvi
Very grateful n genuine girl ,God bless !!!! ✌😘
Everywhere people keep saying. “ Nepotism... Nepotism... Nepotism!!!!” I say it’s jealousy towards them!!! It’s not their fault to born as star kid !!! Who will reject the opportunities that comes along with the silver spoon 🥄?
All because of money &amp; power 😏
Lukng like sriya saran
If sridevi would have been alive ,she would be more happy seeing her daughter
Why everyone spreading hate in Suhana&#39;s video and loving Janvi? Suhana didn&#39;t deserve that..
The thing about Janhvi is, tbvh, everything about her revolves around her mom. Not to be rude or anything but don&#39;t you have any self identity? Why do you have to talk about Sridevi in every interview?
We want reality...... Not....
She is cute
You look fabulous in make up
I love love love her
itna  kuch  karke  bhi  dirty  lagti  he  ..uffffffffsh
bogus    face..
Look at her nose lips n teeth...u will find her ugly.

love u Jhanvi ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nice
Wow 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Madharchodoon karne ke liye kaam nahi
No one cares about her. She has contributed nothing towards Indian Cinema. Stop showcasing her. Its mind baffling how you make a big deal out of her,just because she&#39;s the daughter of sridevi,while millions of well deserving talents are completely ignored. Please stop this disgusting shit and feature someone who actually deserves to be there.
She looks like her mom😍😋
That dress looked really pretty on her💕
So very proud of this strong little woman ✌🏼❤️💐
plastic surgery queen
I love u janvi😍😘😘😘😍
She is Enjoying her life. After Her mother&#39;s Death.
Ab vaha  ..khuch  gira Mt  dena  jhanvi
She looks a little like Sameera Reddy ..
Nepo kid
Supermodels around the world and women who have proved their mettle consider it their good fortune and a mark of success to be offered a vogue cover. Here in India all you need is a surname. <br>At least allow these ladies to prove themselves. What on earth is Suhana Khan doing on Vogue? <br><br>If your dad works with an MNC you don&#39;t get to be on the cover of Forbes while still in school.
Put your face everything all company makeup very soon you looking old because of make
She is too young for all this. Such an artificial life. Superficial
Jhanvi is so much beautiful
