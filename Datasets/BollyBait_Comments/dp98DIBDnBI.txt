Ayushmann is just so amazing , I remember back in 2014 , I was the only girl among all the girls in my group who was extremely obsessed with this guy, they used to ask me why I liked him so much , I just said because he had everything in himself , and now they have joined my fan club as well , so it’s not only ayushmanns success but it’s also the dream of some people like me who believed in their choices

Nowadays if you are loyal to your partner and successful or content in your personal and professional life people are jealous.people around you want your attention if you do not give that or do not compromise your loyalty they are so jealous.
I just love this man ❤
Happiness family to sirji
A new poll for a poll, <a href="https://funs.tribe.so/">https://funs.tribe.so/</a>.

aao kabhi haveli pe...😂😂💛
Such a talented one!💯
This man is so talented
man i love him so much &lt;3
Host was wonderful to question for the answers to give by ayushman
Tahira is so lucky♥️
Only people with pure heart can smile like so beautifully ❤<br>I&#39;m in love with your poems man😍❤
Ayushman is good actor
Such an overrated actor!!!
Ayushmann won both best male debut and best male playback singer the same year 👏👏👏
Wat crap how can anyone ask if u cheated on ur wife 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and even having the stupidity to say no way <br> Ayushmann handled him well
He&#39;s a Gem 💎
Interviewer is a disrespectful ass
The host is so irritating... Asking the stupidest questions
Not a surprise that thahira recovered soon with this wonderful man
Cheerful man<br>Loveu 🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
I used to change my favourite hero every month ,but one day  Ayushmann khurrana came 😍😃
His smile is❤️
He actually looks like 25years old, who will say that he&#39;s 35.❤❤❤
Filmfare you did not get an anchor in 1.2 billion population..? Ye koun hai yaar...
Omg! That question was not just inappropriate but also stupid. Do you expect someone to say ,yes I have cheated on my wife? And secondly, will you ever ask a  question like this to SRK or Akshay ?
Ayushmann we share the same birthdate💟☺❤🥰
He is mind-blowing
Does anyone know how to get the name initialed on that guitar?
One like for poem👍
Soooo...funny interview. Aayushmann is the best ever actor. No one can take his place, whether it is singing or acting. What a great poem. I m his biggest fan...🤩❤ What a cute expression on getting the guitar. ❤
He bothers for film when she was fighting with life shame
Ayusman❤❤❤❤
I loveeeeeeee Ayushmann Khurrana.. He is sooo cuteeee...
Oh my god I just fell in love with ur smile... only few can smile like dis.. complete smile... smile from d heart..
U r smile can kill anyone, so cuteee, cuter than taimur ya
Aayushaman ❤️
Oh my god , u are really amazing, I am huge fan of yours. Love you ayushman.
Ayushmann Khuranna: Delightful, charismatic, multi-talented, charming and having the best set of teeth!👍🏻
Luv u mahn....
Aayushman 😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love Ayushmann
Superb singer and Ayushmann you are an amazing person
He Is the best 😍😍😍😍😍
Then only interview I watched, bcoz of Ayushmann 😍<br>He is so versatile and original
My birthday is also on 14th September
ayushman a total fake slept with his manager
I just love this man.
Man I absolutely love his voice
The interviewer was tryna seem cool and modern by asking questions on his relationship but wtf ‘Have you cheated on your wife’
Someone needs to slap the interviewer for that cheating question
Where we can get the full videos?
This interviewer is such a dipshit tf
Multitalented person...
I love u Ayushmann<br>U are the best
Very nice
He much more looks like my hindi teacher.
love this guy since his vj days,  He was hilarious back then too, now has grown to be such a talented actor n most importantly a beautiful human being. Ppl like Sanjay dutt abandoned their wives in cancer n got a biopic, but this guy is rock solid with his wife but got the deserved fame much much later. May be that&#39;s how Karan sixer johar&#39;s network works,  promote arjun saandh kapoor as the next big thing,  sideline ppl like ayushman n rajkumar rao
Ayushmann is the complete package.... just love his voice... 😘😘❤️
He is a good human being and a good singer. ❤
JJo😂😂😂😂😂
Vry humble guy so mch talented n self made.nice combination of talent and hard work .jst luv this guy n his film choices
AYUSHMAN IS BEST AND SO INSPIRING 😭💘
Insisting that a husband and a father cheated on his wife, so casually on camera. Disgusting, Jitesh. What&#39;s wrong with you guys at @filmfare? If someone did this to my partner, I&#39;d slap the interviewer in his office. This industry is so disgusting. Karan Johar laughing when ranveer said to anushka &quot;do you want your ass pinched&quot;, Jitesh laughing that Ayushmann cheated. Do you have any idea how nauseating it is for the children? For the wife?
&quot;Kya kyu lagta hai esa iss admi ko?&quot; 😂😂😂
his reaction after realising its a guitar 😂👏😲
The host sounds like a chambu. I expected some maturity. Also how can the host openly ask whether Ayushmann cheated on his wife right after asking how did his wife cope with breast cancer. Such a bummer!!
😍
I think he chose the right roles. There is nothing special about his acting
He is so awesome
I would have been super mad if anyone let alone a journalist asked me if i have ever cheated on my wife. Excuse me what kind of a question is that? Cheating is not something you just mention so lightly specially if someone is married. And what kind of answer do you expect when asking Ayushmann this? Please ask proper intellectual questions that will actually educate or give new perspective to viewers. Stop making journalism a joke! <br>Good Vibes!!
I love ayushmannnnnnn 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Anchor&#39;s way of asking the question is very nice.
Interviewer’s voice sounds like he is acting like a kid!!!! Is it only me who feels it looks immature and irritating?! The way he sits seem u comfortable too!
I am in love with ayushmann😍
Most positive person on bollywood
Loved d guitar he was so happy seeing it☺
♥️♥️
I seriously think this interviewer is crazy and creepy
I freaking love him
Jjo acts lyk kjo
He z a charmer
💖
PLS PLS PLSSS CHANGE THE INTERVIEWER!! Ufffff just listen what and how he is asking questions
14 September Is my birthday also ... HAPPY found a star who Is having 14 sept as birthday
He is a Virgo too 😃 mine is on September 11th.. now I know why I have big crush on him 😍
How can he ask such moronic questions that if he has cheated on his wife even after knowing the fact that she is fighting for cancer and they have been together with each other loyally for 20 years and when Ayushman says no then that asshole is forcing him to accept it as if it&#39;s something to be proud of as a successful star!<br>Matlab 100 crores kama li, star bann gaye and you&#39;ve got the license to sleep with other women despite being married apparently.<br>What an idiot anchor! <br>Is Filmfare really running out of people that they have to hire this stupid person as a host/anchor???
This feminine editor trying to destroy his family life. Ass hole
Omg... man... too much talent...😍😍😍
What a horrible question to ask if he’s cheated in the last 10 years.
Jitesh Pillai, cheating is not a joke. Especially not a joke to make after asking him about Tahira’s cancer. Not every married man in the industry is a cheater. You are crazy!
Multitalented guy...big fan
The fuck was that?! Cheated on your wife? You do know she&#39;s undergoing cancer treatments right? Why asking this question to him specifically?
He is trying to ignore what he is going trough What a Great Husband  he is.  That song was my favorite part of this interview
How honest is he....
I love this man 😍😍😍
He is very talented 😘
I love Ayushmann jacket.
He is great actor .He is so humble nd down to the earth
Omg his poem👏👏
The poem ❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
wow...he is such a gem..
Why is the host talking like SAROJ KHAN?
karan johar part 2..🙄🙄
Lovely poem ayushmann... U r blessed wid extra talents... Keep it up... Lots of luv...
Wait......<br>Is this coffee with karan?
Hilarious video!!!
Isn&#39;t he looking soo hot???
Ayushmann is sooooo soo cute
Jitesh pillai, the interviewer, was a disgrace here. Very distasteful the way he went on about &#39; I don&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t cheated on your wife&#39;, &#39; you are lying&#39;, &#39; committed ho ke bhi cheat kar sakte hai&#39;. Ayushmann had already answered his question but that pervert goes on and  on. That too right after asking Ayushmann about his wife&#39;s cancer. What the hell was jitesh trying to prove? That it&#39;s cool to cheat on your partner???<br>I very strongly object to this line of questioningng and would like someone at Filmfare to tell him off. For God&#39;s sake he is the fucking editor of the magazine. And he has definitely not represented the brand well. Is this the standard and example jitesh sets for the magazine?? Absolutely disrespectful! Very cheap and distasteful for us viewers. <br>Please someone pull him up for this! Thanks!!
he look so bad
😍😍😍😍
Ayushmaan...😍😍😍😍
His dimples are so cuteeeeee😍😍😍
Is he a gay???
Love you Ayushman .from Pakistan 🌹🏵️😍
Ayushmann is soooo amazing. Love him so muchhhh. His the best

The questions are so repetitive in each interview that I can answer on Ayushman&#39;s behalf.
Wow
He is amazing 😍😍😍💕💕
Best
he such a awesome guy
His voice 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
That poem 😍
&quot;Have you cheated on your wife in the last 10 years?&quot; Are you kidding me? What kind of question is that to ask? Not mention RIGHT AFTER talking about her cancer diagnosis. I can&#39;t even describe how ridiculous and stupid  that was.
just love ayushmaann
His voice is superb bbb
I would love Ayushmann to make song on this beautiful poem.. Mukhote
I love you ayushman 💕
i love u ayushmann &lt;3
Interviewer is an idiot! Literally, why would you ask a married man if his cheated on his wife! 😒

one of the brilliant actor.... Complete package for superstar...<br>I just ask one question for Aayushmaan that... HOW TO  CHOOSE YOUR MOVIE SCRIPT???? <br>lots of love..... 😊😊😊
&quot;Have you cheated on your wife in the last 10 years?&quot; Did he seriously asking this question??! Ayushmann answered it well, but I don&#39;t think this question was appropriate to ask a married man. Especially after mentioning her and their relationship and then you ask this?
Muaahhh Ayushmann...you are amazing...
Honestly came back because of interviewer! He is so fun and happy face. Keep it up
Ao kabhi haveli pe...  Lol
This jijo kijo is another gay or what??? What a horrible personality.
Every word of that poem is so true
