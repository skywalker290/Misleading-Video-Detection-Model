Big loss for Bollywood I miss u really sir Allah bless your soul with rest and be peaceful
Thank you, god you sent Irrfan Sahab for us...
Its 2024 and i still cannot believe he’s gone.
❤
it still melts my heart, listening fir  kabhi at last. Yes, surely fir kabhi irrfan sahab :)
G.O.A.T
If I have seen someone acting its u sir .
I would like to say Namaste to Mr Irrfan as well as Tabbu mam through this program , and wish them a happy Dasehra though it is so late , Utkarsha
“Hum Jo naariyal fodte hai Bollywood mein, Hollywood me in tuo koi nahi fodta“ ……EPIC
स्वर्ग मे भगवान बॉलिवुड मे इरफान 😭😔😭
Now these interviews act like tonic to my eyes which will keep missing him
Feel like this gem 💎 still alive ❤
They should have interviewed him in hindi instead, <br>If you think I&#39;m disrespecting him then you are too dumb to own a smart phone.
That ‘fir kabhi’ in the end just hit hard.
❤❤❤
Within few year&#39;s so many actor&#39;s live this earth,but never cried for any one ,but when Irfan sir died i cried my heart out and every time I watch any of his interviews or movies i cant watch it without criyng.
Ghatya actor
Again here to cheer my best actor, wisest person and great human being 🎉 Irrfan Sahab ❤️
He may have been a scattered man but he was a good man. Rare quality now a days. People lack responsibility, empathy, dedication &amp; genuineness 💯 hoping his kids take after him.
He was missing a father in his life lifelong &amp; he had a naggy &amp; manager seeking mother. His stubborness got him through so much negativities of his life &amp; he reached his potential with so much perseverance &amp; dedication to the art of acting. He broke down hurdles which came in his path to life. What an inspiration 👍🏻
Acting Looks Easy On Screen But it&#39;s Really Difficult To Do. 😐
Actor - Talent + Training + Luck - all imp. 👍
Still Can&#39;t Believe Irrfan Sir Is No More In This World. 😕
You&#39;ll always my favourite actor. RIP ❤
Pansingh Tomar
I usually watch this interview when I&#39;m down or not keeping up. The way Irfan talks about cinema and life is really soothing. The way he speaks English, subject and knowledge all helps build a confidence. Really a true artist.
We will never have another Irfan Khan. What a man. What a legend.
We miss him forever, only actor who can come near Irrfan’s talent or reminds us irrfaans acting is Nawazuddin Siddiqui.
King khan for me❤

2023
In a fraternity full of heroes,we lost our <a href="http://actor.rip/">Actor.RIP</a>
You want Irfan to speak grandiose words describing himself and his art but all you get is just SIMPLICITLY.
Who is watching irfaan in 2023
kisi ka jana itna hit nahi kiya dost jitna tumhara jana kiya
Anupama ji o r looking vbeautiful so sweet  v charming
I have noticed that females laugh unnecessarily
No one could replace him😏✌️💕
How can he die ?
I miss Irfan so much<br>I wish we could witness a strong scripted film casting Naseer U Din Shah, Irfan Khan, Nawaz U din Sadidque, Nana Parikar, Om puri, Amresh Puri, Manoj Bajpaye, Vijay Raaz all of them in the same film. kaaaashhh...
Jewel of acting.. Alwys missing 😢
Irrfan Khan...He was not an Actor like others..<br>He was a Gem created by Nature, A Genuine personality..I don&#39;t know why...but his loss feels a personal loss.<br><br>Dear India<br>Please take care of such Gems, they are bron in centuries, I cannot believe he got sick so early and Left to his God. <br>His last written statements is a Precious piece of writing.<br> <br>May God bless him in afterlife.

Poonani
Fir yaad agayi bhai ki.....<br>What an Actor he was.
नवाज भाई के इंटरव्यू मे भी same audience थी।
World&#39;s greatest actor of all time
Tum Hindi main kiu nhi karte
Irrfan, i miss you 💔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=1000">16:40</a> he is talking about SRK
R.I.P IRRFAN KHAN JI💔😢🌹💐

We really miss you Irfan sir !! Such a legendary actor.
Viewed second time, so inspiring and original. We lost the greatest artist of our time and a great human being . Rest in Peace Sir.
He talked about SK in one point.
Its 2022 and still missing him..ll keep watching his films in repeat..hes full lov n blessing😌❤️😘😘😘
love u miss u sir Irfan
Miss you Sir… Thank you for giving us genuine cinema 🙏… and especially teaching me what art and artist truly is ❤️
Bastards DIE legends DEPART🔥❤️
♥️
One of the most talented and finest actors of Bollywood. Miss him 😢
Did he say &quot;I&#39;m still not as easy as Mark Ruffalo&quot;?
Zameen kha gai asmaan kaise kaise
😍😍
The confidence
I reach wherever i find him.
Miss him sooo much ❤🙏
My best flim of irrfan is talvar
💝
Why his eyes are swollen.
One of the best part of this video is that everyone really asked some awesome questions. Kudos to the audience. The audience also defines the actor.
My personal unfulfilled dream is that Irfaan Khan and SSR would have worked together. For me, the B town lost two gems with the loss of these two.
what a legend
They need to turn her mic down when Mrs Chopra laughs.<br><br>Irfan&#39;s voice is naturally deeper so it is hard to hear him on a normal volume. So when Anupama gets a laugh going with the same system volume and oppressive, it is so annoying. <br><br>I want to hear what Irrfan has to say, not hear Anupama laugh.
Can&#39;t believe he is not with us .<br>One of cinemas finest contributer.<br>Irrfan sir i love you a lot.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
who is angli.and anisbasmi

One of a kind, unique style of his own. Miss you Irfan.
your one click can change my whole life 🙏😭😭🙏.......
Anupama Chopra is the best interviewer
Kash is pure video ko Mai Hindi me dekh,sun pata......💔😔
He had so much to give....ocean of talent !! you will always be missed.
Watched it 2nd time. Has there been a greater actor than Irfan in Hindi cinema ? I don’t think so. He passed away too early yet his impact would be forever. Also, his peace is visible here.
! ! !
Felt broken every time, when I remember you&#39;re no more.
I had to take the day off when I heard of his demise.
Please invite shahid kapoor in fc unfiltered.
RIP irrfan<br>You will always be remembered. I hope you will came here in your rebirth although I don&#39;t belive in any almighty or god but still I am looking for your rebirth. Miss you gem😥😥😢
Watching 2021. Enjoying it.
Its been one year..still evry day whn i see irfan sahb smwhere in movie  show or vdeo..it feels lyk what a big prsnl loss i had...i dnt find any artist tht much attachd to norml public
One of my favorite actor Irfhan Khan. May his soul rest in peace. He will remain in our hearts forever.
what a loss to the world!!  Just devastating.
why the god couldn&#39;t just take salman khan? We&#39;d have thrown his useless brothers as well.
💔🙂
Its a treat to watch this man.Hope you are resting well sir.
Who is watching this interview in 2021 ?? <br>Love 💕 u from Melbourne Australia
he made us IRRFAN WITH HIS WORK
He should be given an honorary Oscar. Then everybody can find some mental piece. He is the one loved by all.
Sir miss u if u were theretoday u would have ruled netflix today 😒
I miss you irfaan...
, 😯❤
And Anupama I love your interviews and most when you dig out such a real insight from such an artists <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23anupamachopra">#AnupamaChopra</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23love">#Love</a>

What aches me most is that he had just come there for commercial cinema with movies like Hindi Medium and Lunch Box and I was thinking right then he will get his due financially / popularity wise and our Indian Cinema&#39;s standards would raise now more and more actors like him coming to the centre and just then he left !! <br><br>Just now artists were taking the lead, just now storytelling  acting was celebrated and he went just then....<br><br>Much more we wanted from him....<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lovedmovie">#Lovedmovie</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yesalizindagi">#YeSaliZindagi</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23irfan">#Irfan</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chitrnagada">#Chitrnagada</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sudheermishra">#SudheerMishra</a> as well and always wondered why it didnt work at the box office !!

Ms anupama ..I think u should take interviews in Hindi and English mix.some people get very comfortable in Hindi to explain some memories.but when u speak in English again they restrict them and get diplomatic.
wake up sid
Who is watching this great man during LOCKDOWN2.
Such honesty , such depth and so much of a childlike demeanour . Two ends of the spectrum . <br>Possible only from Irrfan Khan . <br>You live on and will continue to , always . ❤️
Man when he said phir kabhi😭😭😭😭😭......miss you irfan sir❤️...best in the world.
RIP sirjee 😘 he just kicked out Arjun “the useless Kapoor” s thought.
He&#39;s an angelic being that Mafia-wood didn&#39;t deserve. So he left soon ❤️❤️❤️
I wish this interview had continued.
Speaks so well
Every time I watch this man, I get instant goosebumps and just pure love and respect. Irrfan Khan, I miss you so much, but I know after all you are a soul and I let your soul rest in peace and go. I hope you get &amp; bring even more beautiful experiences in your next lives. Who knows, another brilliant actor and real human is born. We will see in the next 20 years! My goal is to watch all of your movies right now, the masterpieces I have missed, and for sure your legacy will live on. For me, you are the actual Bollywood King, but just my true life inspiration, not even related to acting but just the nature of you I have been able to observe...so the Everything King! Your sons and wife are proud of you and will make you proud too. With love and respect towards your soul, from South America, Suriname. ✊🏼❤️✨
Everybody knows he is the real King Khan.....
A true Indian 👍
Love irfan love india
Gone too soon.. Love you..will keep loving you..
2021 anyone ?
Anyone still seeing he&#39;s such videos
Some people are so beautiful that the make me believe God has created them with their own hand.
Lagta hi nai he is no more.. listening him talk and watching him speak.. feels like he is amidst us..
After this pandemic slows down, I would love to create a fan club of him. It would be my way of giving respect to him.
Guy in the background looks like Nishant Tanwar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=2125">35:25</a>
❤
I just watched &#39;Celebrating Irrfan&#39; on Film Companion and had to listen Irrfan&#39;s voice. I still have difficulty dealing with the fact that he no more treads this earth. His loss felt so personal. I still can&#39;t hold my tears when I see or hear him or about him and it&#39;s been over an year.
Fir kabhi.... And we are never going to see him again. 💔😔
For the first time in my life death of a Bollywood star became a personal one. You will be missed and you&#39;re one undoubtedly a master performer...very intelligent too...
Splinded interview. Remembering Irfan Sir.
Miss you!
Love you Irrfan
Even an actor of his calibre openly mentioned that if an actor has a different special quality which mediocre stars do not have they become insecure and team against this actor ... all great and good actors had faced such situations in this dirty druggie Bollywood including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nawazuddin">#Nawazuddin</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushantsinghrajput">#SushantSinghRajput</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sushant">#Sushant</a> was also a great actor yet self made and this was enough to build insecurity amidst the chamchas ..  <br><br>Irrfan is a legend and still he had to face this .. We have missed a lot of Irrfan movies bcz these insecure guys didn’t give him enough roles and opportunities <br><br>We are the losers
Miss you sir
His death is a personal loss. No one can match what he had. What a loss for Indian cinema.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=528">8:48</a> ..Irrfan says he will reach there..that sunk my heart..
Kaun kaun - Baki samajhdaar samajh jayenge.
Everyone is agreed that he was a true legend....
I was here!!!! I am so so glad I got the opportunity to watch him speak &amp; be in his presence! Anupama, as always you were wonderful :) Thank you
Watched it again after 4 years &lt;3 <br>How beautiful of a soul he was!
It just make me feel so small that we realise the worth of a gem only when it is lost be it sushant be it irrfan sir it really make u feel are we really looking on the humans as per their skill set or just following the mob mentality
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDQdqr4CxSA">https://youtu.be/lDQdqr4CxSA</a>  🥲<br>A small tribute for Irrfan... Saahab. Miss him so much everyday but this day is always going to hit hard 😥 His dimples and laughter was incredibly beautiful
Rewatching it again when babil talked about it in interview with film companion
Loved the way he talk... really miss him and his cimena 😑
here a year after his death.. how amazing this man is.. rest in peace legend.
No one literally no one. youtube algorithm on  one year death anneversary of Irrfan sir.
YT suggested this exact after 1 year of his passing away ☹️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NYLkBaHNqk">https://youtu.be/3NYLkBaHNqk</a>
You have to come and watch this again after Sutapa and Babil interview. Undoubtedly.
Came again after Sutapa and Babil interview. This man is ❤️
Laughing to his jokes and ending up crying coz we have lost him .. 💔
❤️❤️❤️
Great Human Irrfan Khan Sir

Beeing an actor i always go for spontaneity

Irfaan sir is eternal ❤️❤️❤️
Irrfan is enough
Don&#39;t know from where I just remember him and came here....don&#39;t know y but his passing away is still unbelievable.
&quot;Not following a formula&quot; thats why it is art not science
Bhot jaldi chale gaye aap sahab, upar aake aapse khul ke shikwa karunga, jab mera waqt aayega tab.
After his demise, i felt like one of my family members passed away. <br>He is a legend and legents are immortal ❤
Love Irfan khan
RIP ; allah apnay bandoh ki magfirat farmaye karam farmaye ameen 🤲
Untill and unless you become a good human being... You can never be an actor...<br>No wonder Irrfan was the best actor😍
I sorely miss him
Phir kabhi 💓💔💓
Happy birthday Irrfan
298 dislikes by sallu fans kind of people 😂
I only ever cried once in life 💔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=2242">37:22</a> He said &#39;Phir Kabhi&#39;. 😢💔<br>The only certain thing is that Life is uncertain. 💐🙏

He  is very  informative <br>You  learn  a lot
Greatest actor india has produced . 🙏
Like sushant like irfan. 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Even after his untimely death he has given me a confusion for my life to wonder 🙄if he was a greatest actor that we have seen or an honest &amp; down to earth open minded person ❤️(only actor that I saw defending &amp; have a discussion on a national news over religion with managers of the religion ,who even gave him a fatwa😂)
I loved his acting, I loved his movies but I never thought that I will be so sad by his untimely death 😭 iski maut khal gayi bhai 😢
Irrfan, you Beauty ❤️

This video is a Masterclass on Method Acting.
I was there
Maut kaisi cheez hai na jaane insaan ko kahan le jati hai jahan se kabhi koi wapis nhi aata 💔
Pleasant personality. Thank you for leading the life you did !!
the host does a lot of overacting.
Hindi me baat puri trh se bahar aati h<br>English kai chizo ko chupa leti h
Irfan shall remain with us always
He truly a legend....deeply miss his eyes, body language and his awesome acting. I can&#39;t believe that he is not with us. We miss you Yogi ( Kareeb Kareeb Single)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=1">0:01</a> SP Balu sir said the same thing in an old 90s show (but he said artist instead of actor)<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iInyPAev4YU">https://youtu.be/iInyPAev4YU</a><br><br>No wonder they are both in a better place today<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23irrfanspbamarrahe">#IrrfanSPBAmarRahe</a>
Miss him
He is a pure soul😘
Because everyday is a irfan appreciation day💙
For me Irfan sir was a real life person more than actor. Many actors like Akshay Kumar, Ayushmaan Khurrana, Amir Khan came. But they were not able to touch the Naturalistic nature of Irfan sir
Never forget this man💙
He is a ture artist.
No one will ever fill this man&#39;s chair. A true &#39;star&#39;. Rest in Art, sir.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=2241">37:21</a> Phir kabhi aaya hi nahin Irrfan.
An actor par excellence....you shall always be remembered Irfan
Miss u sir
Much love to you, where ever you are. <br>You are an inspiration for many of us.
Rishi kapoor, irfan Khan, sushant Singh rajput ,infact three ireplacable talents gone too soon in this year. 😔💔
BINOD
BC starting me ye Anupama Chopra itni zor se cheekhi ki ghar pe sab so rahe the uth gaye 😤😡
I miss him... He is one celebrity... One star...one famous person ... Who I have never met but I really miss him 💔
So far the best actor that indian film industry have ever produced.
Irrfanji, wr Irrfanji, no1can replace them. Not even their son. As, he wl hv his mom&#39;genes as well. Offcourse, Irrfanji&#39;wife wl be kind hearted like them. Bt,onces Irrfanji had said, that bengali&#39;R tough. So, she wl be more stronger then Irrfanji. Would had upper hand on them. Irrfanji, wr too..... humble person, luv their nature. Came 2knw them as a person,after they gone. 😓Still I do hv respect for their family. As, it&#39;s Irrfanji&#39;family.
A great actor. We&#39;ll miss him.
You’ll always be in my heart. You taught me a lot.
Awesome IRRFAN KHAN Paper Cutting Art <br>Must Watch <br>Only 2 Min<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2r84zmrfO0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2r84zmrfO0</a>

How the man sitting in the first row reaction changed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=1684">28:04</a> !!<br>As if he suddenly became afraid of Anupama Ma&#39;am&#39;s laugh 😆😆
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TWo5YucX-E">https://youtu.be/6TWo5YucX-E</a>
Internationally one of the best actors! What a wonderful person. You can see the depth of his knowledge in this interview.
That’s not true : Actually: Haha HA <br>HapPy HaPpy Funny
There is no words because no words describe the value of this man  he is such a legend 💯
He spoke clearly about what is being said about SSR&#39;s incident.
the one and true khan....rockstar!
what a great soul
he said phir kabhie, at the end of the interview which just made me so sad ! brilliant actor
&quot;Idhar girega, udhar girega!... &quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV_ohWbzzQg">https://youtu.be/sV_ohWbzzQg</a> one of the best interview of irrfan
Watching him really hurts right now
I love you Irrfan, the legend ❤
I see Irrfan khan and I hit like .. the talent and craft of his magnitude can never be created in Indian Cinema
My eyes still searching for him. Can&#39;t get over this great actor.
I can relate to him so much when u get bored easily it sucks u hv to move on. Anxiety is a part of my life i have to take meds for it not nice but you controll it. He&#39;s a true gem genius he wares his heart on his sleeve luv this man i thank God for letting us get a glimpse of him he was a man of respect God give irfan the highest of highest rank in heaven luv him always
Cme back irrfan sir I think ur alive<br>I don&#39;t want to believe
A truly fascinating man, and a truly gifted actor. Gone far too young!!!
Irrfan Khan was a brilliant actor &amp; a wise man :( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PEWkkcfeIs">https://youtu.be/6PEWkkcfeIs</a>
he will never be fully gone from inside us all... what an adorable human being!
Why do you have to go so early Sir? You just broke millions of hearts. Rest In Peace sir♥️
Anupama chopra&#39;s way of taking an interview is like a fresh air, breeze.... very knowledgeable performance.  Mr Vidhuvinod chopra is very lucky to have her as a life partner.
you can see his brilliance. what an intelligent man he was apart from being an incredible actor. So insightful, the world of cinema lost a gem.
A piece of my heart has gone with him but he stays in me, with the goodness in me because if not for his philosophies, I would have been all over the place. Irrfan, is not the name of a human being, but a phenomena. You were, you are and you’ll stay forever. Those eyes and that voice will guide me through the day, all my life. Thank You for existing in flesh and blood! 🙏🏻
Please send him back GOD😢🙏😢......no can forget oscar man😍 IRRFAN bhi...😔..GAME OF LIFE
Rest in peace,my friend. May God give your family the strength to bear the loss
My heart refuses to accept he is no more 😓
ALLAH RAHMET EYLESİN mekanı cennet olsun inşallah 😥😥😥😥
Yrr . Irfan Khan ka jana mere liye to jyse personal loss h. Ysa lgta h ki koi mer sbse pyari chj jisse me sbse jyda pyar krta tha ar ab vo mujhe kabhi nhi dekhne ko nhi milgi. Ar ab sali zindgi ysi hi gazrni pdegi mgr oski yad hr mod pe aygi.. .... Irfan Khan bolu ya god gifted actor bolu sb kam h.... Inke liye mne ek shayri bhi likhi h vo me jarur  comment me add krna chata hu ar ek din kr dunga... Guys mahan kavi santosh Anand ji ne likha h.. ki jo beet gya vo daur .. vo daur na .. ab iss dil me tere siva koi ar na Ayega .koi ar na Ayega....
I said the same thing : as Irfan Bhai #<br>AfterALL Anupam ji Said : <br>If you’re a good lier , then Definitely you’ll BE the Great Actor # I’m trying Too
Who are the people, going on every video and just putting a dislike
He said he had abused his body too much with whatever things we don&#39;t wanna know about. Dunno if that&#39;s the reason he passed away so soon. But I&#39;m not blaming him but if he did that he&#39;d done a bad favour to us by not living longer. His personality can be connected by us common men and that&#39;s why we love him so much that losing him seems like losing our best friend. Whatever it&#39;s been, we enjoyed your work and great you blessed us even with few years. We miss you Irfan, rest in peace. Hope you&#39;ve met your mother
Fir kabhi....
Cinema has lost a very rare n precious gem
Its been two weeks since his death still that voidness in the heart is not getting filled.Never has the death of any celebrity given me such feels.
He is such a mature,composed,straightforward guy.Also his sense of humor is great.<br>You just want to keep listening to him,so much depth but so natural and honest.True artist.Did not get his due in the Indian cinema.<br>Srk,Salman and others look like jokers!
The most talented, humble yet not that lucky soul! RIP!
This interview is not in English it is in &quot;Forced English&quot;
Both interviewer and interviewee are best
Always loved Irrfan&#39;s craft, so unique and versatile and real.Realizing his value and talent more profoundly now that he&#39;s left the world :( Very big loss for the industry indeed!!
He is the king of natural in the art of acting, I can proudly say that nobody can act such unique style of Irfan ji !!!!
I loved seeing Irrfan Khan&#39;s movies.  He is so special and down to earth person.  watching him is a treat and he is very versatile in playing any character role given to him,  The world of cinema is going to miss him for his acting skills and an honest and family man.  Long live his memories given to the film industry.
Only Indian actor to succeed in Hollywood.
The only celeb i will always miss... Unfortunately he is gone... RIP
Irfan sir was a great actor and the way he was speaking amazing
Such a kind hearted person
He is most humble soul Eva! Love you anytime!🌈
He was great  in Jurassic world going to soon  condolence to family
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=690">11:30</a> 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Sadly there will be no more phir kabhi.. RIP.
Irrfan ❤❤❤
Such a brilliant artist, I can listen him on and on, his words strikes you. One of the best interviews. ❤️
India&#39;s greatest actor since Bollywood emerged...there is a reason why this man was sought after by Hollywood...
So helpful life advices
ربنا يحمه ويغفر له... He will be Remembered 💜💜😢
Comments 😭
Very nice
Listening to this man is as entertaining as seeing his acting. Irfan Sir you were an institution yourself. You will be badly missed
App log surf gu.n gan karneme lage hai hamane master duttaram jaiso ki Sham chi ayee me dekha hai nahi chahate bhi tula dene ka karuna kinda karne wali acting dekhe hai aiso ka gungan kar rahe ho jaise yek greatest actor that Dawood ke ashirwad se BANA hua actor actress ki gun gan soch samaz kar karo sabhmurakh nahi hote
❤💔
I lost my youngest sister in the year 2009 and was totally shattered. I am going through that same pain knowing I will never see Sir IRRFAN KHAN again. Such impression did he make in our lives. What can be more accomplishing for an artist than to make an impact like that on people. We certainly lost a TREASURE <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23legend">#Legend</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thegreatestkhan">#thegreatestKhan</a>

feeling sad, missing you irrfan
How healthy he is looking just 3 years ago
They say &#39;Diamonds are Forever&#39; .I say &#39;Legends Live Forever&#39;. Legend Irrfan Bhai Jaan is here with us till life. I truly believe that. -Sunil Bharat
Galat bande ko uthaliya bhagwan ne 🙏🏻

It feels like personal loss on losing Irrfan Khan...Allah Pak Jannat nasib kare.. Aamin
Irfaan ji your eyes speaks volumes of unspoken words  of feelings 💘 expectations. <br>Just respect &amp; love to you.
Psychology students can make note of his thoughts.. Amazing observations.
Hit like if you’re here after Irfan Khan’s death
That &quot;fir kabhi&quot; will never come now.
Wonderful wonderful actor and human being - RIP Irfaan Khan
Listen, can we just agree that Irrfan is immortal? His art, what he created will never perish. He is one of a kind and nobody can ever be him.
It&#39;s the 9th day that he is gone, my eyes are still not drying! He was indeed a part of me. With his absence I am left with a void that would take days to fill.
Great you discovered yourself Irrfan Khan. We feel gratified. Listening to your words .. what a pure soul you were. Amazing. World will miss you. Rest in peace 💔💔💔🙏
Indian cinema was blessed to have Irfan Khan and his loss has left a void which is immeasurable. He was a Legend and only thing that is left is his Legacy.
You are always present everywhere......feeling proud for you....God bless you and your family......where ever you are stay happy and in peace 🙏🙏🙏
My Very Favourite Actor...Loved his movies...May Allah Grant Him The Highest Of Jannah...
Too soon, Irrfan, too soon! Very very unfair.
You will be missed Irrfan. My favourite actor.
I&#39;m still mourning. I&#39;m not being sad, I&#39;m just watching ever possible videos or interviews. I just don&#39;t want to feel that he is no more. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s how I&#39;m mourning.
Its the best interview . Irrfan you are so inspiring , straight from the heart always .An everlasting connect you have with all of us .Miss you dearly .RIP Irrfan
I am heartbroken at his death.

मेरे जाने के बाद जब कभी तुम मेरी किसी फ़िल्म को देखोगे , तो तुम्हारे चेहरे पर जो आएगी मैं वो हल्की सी मुस्कान हु , दुआ में याद रखना हिंदुस्तान , <br>मैं अपना अपना इरफ़ान हूँ....

Best Actor👌🙏
He was salt of the earth😔
The formula line, which to me made the most sense in this whole video, recieved the least reaction. Surprising and interesting.
He didn&#39;t like the term bollywood. He said Hind film industry. He is like just a guy next door but still so different and special. He would have played a strict orthodox father in his 60s. He would have played a scientist, a professor, an old lover and so many characters. We will never get to see all the variety again. Miss you.
I don&#39;t want to believe that he is no more...I want to believe that he is there, he is just not doing films for some reason but he is there. Lots of love Irrfan wherever you are. ❤️❤️❤️
Love you Irrfan.. Miss you so much.. Come Back. We need you in this world.. Come back
It&#39;s one week since he left us <a href="http://mortally.one/">mortally.One</a> of the best character actors of Bollywood and one of the first actors of our age who made his mark in International Cinema.He left a void in quality Cinema which is very difficult to fill up.R.I.P Irfan vai will miss u.
i am crying right now for irfaan sir a person whom I HAVE NEVER MET
did Anupama have a crush on Irfan Khan?
Your job shall enrich your soul, amazing person
Can&#39;t imagine he is no more.
Massive loss. This void will never be filled. Ever!🙏
listening  you is  also one of the most satistfying thing I  ever had, RIP Irfan khan.
He was soo lively and natural actor it never felt in any of his movie that he is acting ..rather it felt like he is living real character ... Rip 💔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=19">0:19</a>,,, that girl sitting at very first, looking at back, if cameras really running or not !!!
This is one his best interviews...
May Allah place him in the best place in Jannat. He was an amazing actor.
Now looking at his pictures I realise that the Indian cinema has lost a good actor. RIP Irrfan.
Arti  sharma.. I thinking same like u... rest in peace  irrfan khan.
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😭😭😭
BC mar gaya. gand fat gaya sun ke. shakespeare bola aake.
Day by day my respect and love for  <br>Irrfan sir is growing.... You were such a wonderful person. So well spoken, full of life, family person, down to earth, God of acting, so thoughtful person.....This list will never end up.
Real and honest man Irrfan sir🙏
The dilemma of my life &quot;Your job has to enrich your soul&quot;... So few people can understand that.. Thank you, Irfan, for your wise words.. You had to leave this world to make some of us hear you.. Thank you FC for eliciting and keeping record of that!
Socha tha kabhi mauka milega toh irfan sir ke liye unki film ka ek song gaaunga 😭. My Bad Luck 😑
Really irrfan sir india miss you
Rewatching his films and all interviews 😢<br>I thought I&#39;ll watch his all stuff in Quarantine but not thought i have to watch bc of his departure..<br>Artist like him never die🌸
My tribute to Irfan Khan; A star is born: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwmzCCtumeA">https://youtu.be/wwmzCCtumeA</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwmzCCtumeA">https://youtu.be/wwmzCCtumeA</a>
We were waiting for you irfan....
i dont want to believe that he is no more.. As i have never met him..So i want to believe that he is there and soon his movie will be out..Y should i think that he is dead..No.. no way
Today he is no more...how much sorrowful...we missed the greatest gem of film industry...
You will always be missed brother 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 you left us so early 😞
Cancer is a disease of people who feel lack of resources and ANGER. P<br>I do not know where his life lacked. RIP Irrfan
Almost 6 days now, since his death and still not over him.. It&#39;s like a personal loss . Can&#39;t think anyone who will replace him..
His English was fine <br>I know when I am teaching or spreading knowledge and also when I am saving lives as a physician. <br>I am taking care of the role I am placed. Irrfan RIP
Neuro endocrine tumor was bad news to me as I am a cancer doctor. I still hoped he would do well. But was difficult to accept his RIP and wish well his family
It&#39;s just gutting to hear him end the conversation with&quot;phir kabhi&quot; (another time). There will be no &quot;another time&quot; for us to witnesses this maestro.
Panch din ho gaye:&#39;(
ONLY ONE... Who&#39;s Religion IS  ❤❤FILMIAN
Pull you down wali baat j can completely understand what exactly he meant and again my heart cringes !! Our cinema and it&#39;s people, even audience  were not that evolved to have absorbed or used this great person and actor !! Obviously respect for Indian cinema will grow if we start using these talents, film makers put risks into them, media give them that space even if they are not  into PR and all, becauSe true artists in Most probably manner will be bad in this ( business part of art ), so media u do ur part like Anupama is doing here !! <br>We audience also want this ....Yes we want to watch good content and good grandeur as well ( grandeur may be when we want to go in movie, otherwiSe good content and good as acting is sufficient )give these artists both , good grandeur like Sanjay Levels Bhansali and good content like Anurag, Shoojit, Tigmanshu, Dibakar, Rituparno <br>Great Movies , great actors will remembered for what they are in future for sure <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23anupamachopra">#AnupamaChopra</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23irfan">#Irfan</a>#
Heartbreaking !! My heart just cringes now at the thought of what Indian Cinema lost !! I wish he knew all along how much he mattered !! Never Ever felt such pain at the loss of somebody hadn&#39;t met personally !! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23irfan">#Irfan</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respectbeyondwords">#RespectBeyondWords</a><br>His loss seems so so personal, pain feels so personal ....
Never thought this video will make emotional too.
God please give us Irrfan Khan back. 😭😭
It&#39;s too late we don&#39;t give enough  attention to him but now we have to see good films praising good actors not that greedy actors
😭😭😭😭😭😭
rip.. Irfan sir
For which film promotion did he gave this interview ?............This is the beauty of anupama chopra - she does not promote Actors films but only promotes her show for viewers &amp; subscribers
irrfan sir😭😭❤️❤️
Irfan Khan - end of era😢
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Legends are Immortal 🙏
Really i feels that he had created a very big and separate space in our heart for him......and i consider him as one of the most respectfull .loveable . and kindhearted personality....and very personallly love u  a lot.......and u will be always with us ..ur memory will surely makes us feel that ap tho ithar kahi zaroor hei...............
Yaar Tu Bhai Chala Gaya..
&quot;Unless u become a good human being u can&#39;t become a good actor&quot;<br>                                            -Irrfan<br>  <br><br><br><br>Well, that sums it up pretty much for the likes of Salman Khan, Sanjay Dutt and many more.
Intreatment
My love for him is never ending, such a normal, simple person with life full of struggle
He says &#39;Fir Kabhi&#39; at the end of questionnaire 😔
Tribute to Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor by a fan<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ-oWR4XUFQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ-oWR4XUFQ</a>
Love this man ❤️ Wow this interview is the best Masterclass ever !
Irrfan ❤️
Rip legend uffff....
ऐसा एक्टर कभी कभी पैदा होता हैं<br>I miss you sir...
So lovely. Enrich yourself
Love you the most Irrfan❤
What an intelligent personality so beautifully he portrays himslf as a star.   WILL SURELY BE MISSED   LOVE YOU  IRFAN SAHEB KHAN ❤ RIP..
The first minute into the interview got me hooked, what a man!
May god bless his soul.. such a humble human being... we will miss Irrfan for ever🌷🌷
My deepest condolances to both the families of great actors Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan, both of them were good human beings and OFCOURSE  great actors it&#39;s a great loss to their families and OFCOURSE Bollywood. I am very sad.
Such a comfortable equation Anupama you have built with the interviewee
kya yaar bhagwan! 🤷🤷🤦🤦🤦
This is so sad we wont be able to see him anymore. Amazing  actor amazing  human being. He has given us so much. He talks so little yet show so much. Will miss him always.
the most depressing thing about hid death is i can never watch a 65 year old or a 75 year old Irrfan ACT.
Fabulous actor great human being.. Can&#39;t digest that he is no more. Big loss for Bollywood and for all of us. RIP Irfan Sir 😥😭
🇮🇳🙏🌻🌹 A Great Human and a Stupendous Actor like Irrfan Bhai comes in a millennium. -Sunil Bharat 🇮🇳
I am in denial that he is gone.
Tom Hanks said &#39;when Irrfan walks in the room he (Tom) doesn&#39;t feel coolest person in the room. Tom Hanks acknowledges bhai&#39;s  persona
He was never after money... he did contentful cinema.
Irrfan bhai even made ads  watchable and interesting
Amit ji, Shahrukh sir, Amir sir, Akshay sir are actors... Irrfan bhai is masterpiece &#39;Aritst&#39;... I&#39;ve watched old movies, Hollywood movies and regional cinema, haven&#39;t seen artist like Irrfan bhai... you&#39;ll be missed bhai. 😞
Irrfan sir... U were like none other. The finest actor of this generation by a mile. I have lost count of the number of times i have watched u on a loop in Haasil (my favorite). Never seen anyone underplay it like you did. Subtle glances were enough to convey a lot. It was astonishing how u could so easily master the dialect of an Allahabadi in Haasil to a bandit of badlands of Chambal in Paan Singh.. You have left behind a void which cannot be fulfilled. It is therefore no surprise that so many are grieving for you. It is personal for so many of us. We could have had so much more of you. One can only be left anguished by the unfairness. But your work will live on Sir. You will continue to live on Sir. The love for u will only grow. Peace.
Simply magical RIP IRRFAN SIR
Compelling stuff👍
I don’t think I can ever get this man out of my head, my heart, my being👏
$20000 crores good response
I can&#39;t believe that he is no more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=510">8:30</a> does he say Mark Ruffalo?
Unbelievable  that Irrfan has gone. Great actor  great human being.
Ab main repeat nai karne wala yeh!! 😂 Pure Genius 👌🏻👌🏻
Nariyal....
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23irrfankhan">#IrrfanKhan</a> you will be always remembered!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGw8iGcnDk">https://youtu.be/XNGw8iGcnDk</a>
So wonderful to see this man&#39;s interview . RIP LEGEND. You will live in our hearts forever
He seemed more like a friend than a  actor . you can connect to each role played by him. He had easily another 2 decades of acting in him . Never understood why good people leave so early ?  Also feel Bollywood should have given him more opportunities . He was reaching the pinnacle with English medium and this happened. Will we get someone like him in bollywood ...i think NO.
Jane Vale ho ske toh laut ke aana...RIP...Irrfan Sahab...Love you.
Show must go on....Irrfan sahab ho sake toh phir se aana,abhi Pictures baki hai Irrfan Sahab...missed you So much..
Unki mother ko bhi Allah miya Jannat main Jagah atta farmay...Ameen.
His mother death break him Complete inside &amp; Lockdown not permitted to go and attend mother  Cremation...bcoz his last word Ammi aayi hai sath le jane..
Great person Irrfan Sahab.. RIP Irran Sahab.
He look like tired by face..
A fabulous interview from a fabulous actor. Irfan , you belonged to a different league of actors and your sudden departure feels like a personal loss to all of us who love you RIP
Yaar aysa adakar main ne nain daika.<br>Yaqeen nain hata, Irfan Ham main nain.<br>Muje yaqeen Hai India ne Irfan ko zaya kerdia.
this guy was/is an example of an Organic Human Being in this ultra-modern society!
Great loss of u man..luvd u at lot ..rip legend..no another option like U😍
this khan is more than other khans...if anyone wants to learn acting just watch his movies, all others are just heroes  but he is a star.
https://youtu.be/zArNj-pj83Q<br>Watch this video ..... Irrfan Khan
Kishor dada bharatan do irfan good man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=1860">31:00</a> has the best lines in the interview. It is so pure and even anupama felt the same. Such an outstanding actor and equally wonderful person. RIP Irrfan !!
Khuda inko jannat de .
Love to Irrfan. R.I.P.<br>There will never be another Irrfan Khan.<br>Legends don&#39;t repeat themselves and wonder why!<br>Hope GOD is listening to us 😔
He does look a bit like Mithun Chakraborty
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=690">11:30</a> that reference to Nusrat.  RIP man ... you were a truly great actor, hands down!
He seems like that book everytime you read you learn more n more...🙏🙏
It takes so much thinking  and analysis to clearly express your mind and he does it so well... Irrfan khan is a legit thinker. He is one of the finest actora in the world. Watching this interview again and it still keeps you engaged...brings out different aspects each time.
God will be terrified when real maqbool shows up there...☹️☹️
Royal...Truly how smart he looks actuallyy....The way he speaks...my god 🥰 ...God you did wrong with the world ☹️
God of Acting...you are with creater God 🙏
What a line ..&quot;Irrfan is d only actor who has worked with Ang Lee and Anees Bajmee&quot;......RIP Legend
So endearing... You will be missed...OM Shanti
Thank you Anupama for bringing out beautiful insights from Irrfan. What a artist he was. May his soul rest in peace.
You guys won&#39;t be able to hold your tears...huge tribute to irrfan...my love..👇👇😭<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZz1Y1AUwmg">https://youtu.be/iZz1Y1AUwmg</a>
Chutiya channel.. y english !!..ghullaam of british pple
Wow! What an insightful and intelligent man!
RIP irrfan 🙏
Hollywood mein nariyal koi nahi phodta 🤣
such a gem...such a great loss...
Inspiring interview, he will continue inspire many thousands!
So Painful Incidence and Life.😭😭
Dont know about his acting but he was  surely a man of wisdom .
Ya Allahhh
A saint or a yogi amongst us. Now moved to God&#39;s abode. RIP irrfan khan. You entertained us a lot,  left us in splits with your humor and now making us cry with your absence. The maturity and wisdom that flows from you was spontaneous. Not an easy thing for even the senio rmosts in the tinseltown. RIP bro.
🙏🙏🙏😢😢
What a guy.. What an actor.. Man I have never missed an actor.. I feel like my brother died
The depth in his eyes n voice are truly unmatchable.
irrfan is grtst human n actor...immortal....ajar amar
Love u Irrfan😘
🙏🏻🙏🏻
My heart is full..... 😔😔😔😔
I watched this interview today when Sahebzade Irfan Ali Khan is no more. I had tears in my eyes. Today I also watched Nawazuddin in his 2 interviews with you. Both are different. Irfan was spontaneous.
What an Institution he was.... He would have been great teacher too.... What a man...
As few people already expressed here.. I always enjoyed watching Irrfan films but I am taken by the realization that I am deeply impacted by his passing😞  May Vaheguruji bless his soul 🍀💙
so sad that he&#39;s gone!! gone too soon 😔
This great intensity..intelligence..humility.. endearing voice...intellectual reasoning. Irrfan was truly a unique person ..completely irreplaceable..why does everyone feel it is a personal loss?? Gone too soon..
we have lost such an intelligent man . RIP
Such wisdom can come from only a person who really seriously experimented with himself and his craft. Thank you Irrfan, we&#39;ll miss you!
May God bless his soul🙏
We will miss you Sir. A big vacant in cinema industry has created. Rest in peace.
die hard Irrfan fan wrote this story before his death<br><br><br><a href="https://nimal4you.blogspot.com/2019/03/actor-unknown-last-text-message-series.html">https://nimal4you.blogspot.com/2019/03/actor-unknown-last-text-message-series.html</a>
ur job is to enrich ur soul......................................
I was watching money heist,and I believe Irrfan would have been amazing as the professor, all due respect to the actor who is the professor in the show as he is phenomenal.
Didn&#39;t realise I&#39;ve finished watching 38 minutes interview until hosts said Thank you Irffan. Such a beautiful personality, such a nice human being. RIP Irrfan. You will always be in our hearts.
A legend like no other. Generations to come will fondly remember Irrfan Khan for his immaculate acting skills (that transcended different genres) in both Indian and world cinema. His passing signals the end of an era. Adieu!
He is a great soul! Just like a DEVTA ! His physical appearance is no more but he is still in our hearts, apart from the religion, I hope he is in higher paramount now.
Great hero of international acclaim - here is my tribute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_oZAW6WZgY">https://youtu.be/r_oZAW6WZgY</a>
I have lost part of me.<br>RIP Irrfan.. Sahab..!
न कोई चकाचौंध है न शान है,<br>जो तू न है तो कुछ न इरफान है ।
&quot;Todo todo apna hi ghar hai&quot;<br>I remembered when i heard his departure after Rishi kapoor.
I would have loved if Anupama smiles less.
God bless his soul. A real talent that he was Irrfan will always be remembered!
He was spiritually very active.
I am so much fascinated by him. <br>When he was alive never felt like this. Now I see all interview and find  &#39; how fascinated and amazing personality he was 😍😍
Like always...<br>One of the most cool guy.<br>Lovely program
I am not ready to accept that he is gone. Is he to never again enter the screen and cast his magic? No. No.
What a personality, he was a legend. May Allah swt give him higher rank in janna. Ameen. There will be no other one like him...so sad
A Trained professional Actor<br>Loved him in a art movie PRATHA
Bollywood will always regret for not giving enough opportunities to you legend... But he showed  his beauty of inner soul even in small time he lived ❤️. I never felt so sad before your death. Truly champion . May your aoul rest in peace. Love you Irrfaaan..
I just heard the terrible news...I can’t believe he’s gone at such a young age.  What a loss to movies that are incredible, dramatic and realistic.   I’ve watched many of them and if I noticed he was specifically starring in the film...I would certainly watch it.  Many prayers, blessings and condolences to his beloved family.  What a sad 😢 loss to India 🇮🇳.    🙇🏻‍♀️🔍❤️🙏🏽☝🏽🌏🇺🇸
I feel lost... you were exceptional a rare talent. No one can fill your space. you were a true man of goodheart. I miss u badly❤️❤️
37 minutes of happiness experience it&#39;s just like 5 minutes to me.  Wanting more   . Ina lilahi wa ina ilayhi raji&#39;un  .
Forever you will be missed
What a brilliant actor

An actor par excellence and a good soul..May his soul rest in peace!!
Love u ifran <br><br>U are above Amitabh ,sharukh and all Khan<br><br>A true Khan
A grounded interview just watched very nice one let Irrfan soul RIP
All big actors whose previous movies made hundreds of crores are struggling  to reach even  100 cr nowadays. They can&#39;t sell their swag anymore.People still and always like good acting and good script not BS SWAG. Swag is temporary. Good Acting is permanent
So many take-home lines for me from this interview, you are an amazingly positive person , how a person like you can loose the game of life..... Going to miss you ...an actor like you, a person like you... You always have a strange bond with your fans....
Kash💔 ye Interview Hindi Mein Hota
Why the audience looks so creepy??? I mean most of them.. wt expression
If we want the world to be a place where good souls can last longer we have to stop promoting crooks in the name of smartness in every sphere of life. In our world, most crooked people are leading because we don’t need kind people in the society any more. We are bringing up kids to be everything else but a nice human being first, that is evident everywhere now.
Dear we love you so much ... will always love you 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
Now that he is gone I miss him so bad that it hurts.
He is right.
Why people have unliked this video?<br>What has this world come up to <br>Itna pyara insan and usse bhi pyara actor ko bhala koi kaise pasand ni kar sakta yaar.
Anupama Chopra, you have done the world a favour by  capturing  moments with this wonderful artist and human being. It is still not sunk in that he is no more.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=698">11:38</a> Ustad is not going through pain , it is inside him. He is playing with the pain , he is enjoying the pain. Waah kya observation hai !
His death feels so personal....
life has no obligation to give us what we expect .  Rest in peace Irfan. You are gone but your work will continue to live.
I get reminded of another talented actor of yesteryear who passed away very young. Sanjeev Kumar.  I still watch his movies.
Just watched angrezi medium <br>Irfan sir salute you You have beautifully defined the feelings of a father and his love for his child.😢😢😢😢😢😢
Shattered 😢 on this legend&#39;s sudden demise.<br>May God rest his Great Soul in peace...🙏
I just have 2 words to say : Phenomenal. Inspiring. 👍👍👍
Irfan Khan Unseen Viral Video !!<br>@
i still cannot digest he is no more.. he is such a wonderful actor..
Bahaut dukhta hein yaar.<br>This is just not fair. &quot;...Mein ne dil se kaha dhoond lana khushi,<br>nasamajh laya ghum.....&quot;. Irrfanbhai , ye gham saha nahi jata. You have<br>not left, I refuse to address you in the &#39;past tense&#39;
RIP LEGEND 😭😭
RIP amazing actor
jab haste the.. lagta tha ki unke aankh me aur face pe unka dil dikhta tha... lubhavna  hansi... love irfaaaan
ghar ka banda he lagta he... apne liye kabhi bhi ye banda rahega rahega with sweet matured smile.... he naa
Irreplaceable Irrfan😍😘🤗😘❤️ThankGodforyourbirthloveyouforever🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🦋🦋🦋🦋
I wish this was in Hindi
Yeh pehla aisa interview thaa jo dobara bhi dekhne ka mann karta hai itna intelligent conversation..par takleef yeh ki pehle jab dekha thaa tab apna hero zinda thaa ab bas yaadein rahengi.
🙏
He has become immortal through all his movies and interviews like this. Om Shanthi.
We loved Irfan khan and never forget him  ,he was my kids Chacha g and yesturday my kids was feel very bad and we pray for him and did for him 2 rakaat Namaz Allah give to him Rehmat Aamen ..we loves u Irfan Khan
You will be missed!
Art is when it&#39;s reflecting..wow..
Irrfan is/was an Observer of life , he seemed to have challenged his perceptions till he felt at peace with himself, that made him an artist, actor of life&#39;s meaning to portray all humanity, variations , diversity. That made Irrfan a medium transcends all barriers within ourselves, so he brought peace , to us too, the very essence of acceptance oneself as one is. I am so blessed to watch him through his acting. May he be liberated as he wished.🌹❤👈
Love u sir
He&#39;s one of those people who make you feel soothed just listening to him. I think it&#39;s because he was at peace with himself - with his soul...and talks, lives and acts from that sacred place. Once you find your space, you don&#39;t need to exaggerate, make fake smiles, speak louder than you should, laugh at the wrong time, put down other people....etc...because there is no point...it doesn&#39;t serve you in anyway - to impress or hurt other people. I think Irrfan was that kind of person. May he rest in peace.
I really like the question what is your favorite failure
For the first time I am heartbroken by the death of an actor.
Why him God why 😖😖
His intelligence shines through no wonder he was such a great actor!
Innalillahiiwainnahiilahiroojiun. Salute to you forever bro. Al Fatihah (with readings)
It took the news of his death to make me watch this interview. I always thought that there&#39;s time and I will watch it eventually when he will &#39;retire&#39; from films. Apologies for the delay and the reality will always be painful. You left too soon, Sir.
his eyes are really beautifull,
Aache insan Te yaar lekin Baghwhan NE itna time zindagi diya ta Ab sab Baghwhan ka ae Chalta hai 😥
RIP SIR.. 🙏🙏😭😭
Nice to listen to him .Such persons are unique in God&#39;s creation.
Thank you for sharing this insightful interview of Irrfan Khan. So comforting after the shock of  the news of his demise. RIP, such an unforgettable actor and human being!
He was something else. Will miss him a lot. He was one of the most precious gem Bollywood ever had.👍
R.I.P Sir...
Arjun kapoor ka naam liya irrfan khan ke samne. Poora mood kharab kar diya by god.
that humility,  that mindset of I AM STILL STRUGGLING AND ILL BE A GOOD ACTOR SOON....hats off
This somehow feels like a personal loss
I don’t know how to express my emotion , obviously I’m a big fan of IRFAN KHAN Bhai , but I realize I wasn’t good enough fan because I didn’t even know that he was sick that bad , I mean <br>He had cancer , I can’t believe it ! I’m mad at myself anyway , inn lillahe wa inna ilahi rajeun . We all loved you and always love you , your work , I hope India never forgets an iconic actor <br>Like him . RIP the great IRFAN KHAN .
😭😭😭😓😓😓😓
Brave Irfan
RIP ❤️🙏the best actor ever
While I was watching this interview,I was trying to make me realize that he is not with us now.I am still wondering why his death felt so personal to me. It&#39;s really heartbreaking sir,u left too soon.
Rest in peace! Gone too soon 😢😢
Irrfaan Sir..u won the heart<br>Such a great actor.
A song dedicated to Irrfan khan... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdoYKF5BhMw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdoYKF5BhMw</a>

You are, and always will be terribly missed. Irrfan Khan, you were a giant, in a field of minions. Thank you for being so incredible at all that you did.
Rest in peace Irrfan. You were such a soulful actor.
Saw this again and it feels like a new take. Irrfan Khan, you will be missed. 😔🙏
Jaana sabko hain ek din. Bas shikwa        <br> yeh hain ki aap Jaldi chale gaye!
Fir kabhi....R.I P Legend.

Unfortunately I watched this beautiful, full of insights interview now when he left us dumbstruck. I was not aware of this genius side of Irfan Sir. We will miss him.
How humble was he! It’s shocking that we’re now talking about him in past tense! Love him! Will miss him on screen immensely! Rest in peace Irrfan Sir! 🥺💔❤️🙏🏻

RIP, Irrfan...it is such a sad day..
So beautiful. Art only comes when you start making things personal!
A tribute to that man on my channel <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r3V7CI6l8Q">https://youtu.be/5r3V7CI6l8Q</a><br>Go and watch it if you are a fan of him like me
What a Great Soul,Amazing Artist.Just not 🇮🇳 India,but the World has lost a <br>Wonderful Actor.May Allah,Bhagwan and the Lord almighty give his Family,Colleagues,and Friends<br>to deal with this big loss.<br>May his Soul Rest in eternal Peace.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=1093">18:13</a> We see him drinking water directly without pausing the interview and calling fr a glass. Truely he was one of the most grounded. His fate fell like a personal loss. I wished to see him in more movies and was happy when he came back after treatment but 2020 has not been for world and has one more sad news...  Just a question from God that why legends don&#39;t stay long😢💔
RIP 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❣️

I&#39;m again revisiting this interview after i heard about sudden demise of irrfan sir. RIP Irrfan sir, this feels like personal loss and i literally cried when i heard this news. The loss is personal because Irrfan on screen was us. We associate his face with something that altered us, moved us, cleared us and the life we lived after that shall always be indebted to him for making us come closer to our personal truths.
Irfan bhai aap ki aatma ko shanti mile , Aap ne hame movies Nahi duniya ki real life dhikayi hai apne kirdaar se . Aapki saachai aapke kirdaar mai dhikhti hai,desh vidhes mai na bhulne wala itihaas bana chuka hai apka <a href="http://abhinaye.app/">abhinaye.App</a> aise insaan the Jiske liye pura desh roya hai 😭🙏🏻 aur videsh bhi.

R.I.P. 😭😭😭😭😭
RIP would be missed greatly
Kaun kaun ye video lockdown me dekh rha hai?
We must thank tigmanshu dhulia because of him irfan happened. Today irfan is loved, respected and considered the best actor. It was all due to the man who himself is one of the best actor and director of Bollywood and who made haasil for irfan
This interview could have been much more interesting if its would be in Hindi
Bhagwan Irfan ko jaldi se jaldi thik kr de
Irrfan is a living legend. I do hope he is doing fine. He feels like your own family. So full of insights
Sneha Mam sitting on the first seat..
Hii is that nirali kartik in first line?
I am a fan of Irfan. He is a great actor,human being also.
i have come here just because of irfan khan ...otherwise not a bit of interest in watching this channel....
Get well soon  in shaa allah irfan bhai , one of the greatest actor
Nice to see irrfan...the talk wud be more captivating if he  spoke smoothly n continuously...without stammering n repetitive words
Unless and untill you are not a good human being you cannot be a actor , which is not true. - Anupama should have asked more questions about this. Other then that Irrfan Khan  does not masquerade like other Bollywood stars may be because he is more of a Artist then a Star.
Wonderful episode. There is so much to learn from him. Class apart actor. Best wishes for him.
good person and even better actor
Nice to watch your <a href="http://interview.it/">interview.It</a> please our mind.
Irfan sher hai. Sher.
Anupma is equally talented.Irfan to hain hi.great
Kya banda hai real gem of india
Irfan Khan is an actor with not really conventional good looks but he has an aura a presence a personality one cannot ignore if he walks in a room one is bound to notice him he looks so sure of himself somehow i like  him as an actor very interesting so cool !! Wish him all the best 🌹
Really enjoyed the interveiw.
Irffan bhai.....wanna see u back working at full tilt.
anybody else distracted by the thread hanging out of Irrfan&#39;s jacket on his right shoulder
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=1349">22:29</a> yeh jurassic park mein bhi tha?!
He is Godly! Just love him
If I took a shot every time the host breaks in to hysterical laughter I would be shitfaced.
Did you guys notice that irfan said I am still struggling and learning my craft? so what do you guys make of it? and compare with those pompous so called actors and what would you like to say?
Great actor! Wonderful human being.
Watching this after listening to Homi&#39;s  and Radhika&#39;s latest interview with FC, just to see this amazing talent again and again and may be try and forget this amazing talent is in pain. Hope hope he recovers, he gets to throw back  those damn lemons fate threw at him. Prayers with you Irfan😓
WHY are we ALWAYS deriding our cinema? Is ANALYTICAL building i.e. character breakdown before construction seriously necessary for acting to be SUPERIOR - and so-called INTELLECTUAL? If actors are spontaneous without &quot;THINKING&quot; and &quot;RESEARCH&quot; or in other words they don&#39;t use their INTELLECT (as though they have a lot of it) does that mean they are DUMBING IT DOWN?<br>WHY ARE LOW SELF-ESTEEM COMMENTATORS THE INTELLECTUAL VOICE OF CINEMA?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=2048">34:08</a><br>Her reaction is like oh accent hmm mm
Amazing interview!!! So enlightening and enriching.
Bhaiya muhurt nahi matter karta yeh sahi baat hi but insan ko mentally positive rakhta hai ... Har baat me inshallah aur 5 baar namaj , subah uth kar puja , sunday ko church jaane se bhi kuch nahi hota but wo mentally aapko positive rakhta hai ... according to me ..... Although mai aapka bahot bada fan hoo aur CHARAS movie ki acting bahot achhi lagi thi ...wish karta hoo aap jaldi se thik ho jao aapki sehat achhi ho jaye .
Anupama Chopra is such a bad host.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=185">3:05</a> what kind of an occupation is that? Being a Hunter!

This interview is a medicine when you just watched Rajeev Masand’s Newcomer Interview.
Irfan bhai is too good person and acctor,2019 December me maine Irfan ji ko ek massage likkhaa thaa,itna heart teaching kar ke likkhaa thaa ans bi bahat khob surot ayaa thaa.
Dear Irfan, may you be blessed with great health. You are an actor par excellence.

Biggest actor of present era actor not star
The only Actor, I&#39;ve been fond of watching on screen since beginning. Irrfan is a brilliant artist. Very few people have this sense of Art &amp; craft.
Why anupma ji so hot to me
My favorite FC interview.
I have watched nawaz&#39;s interview, pankaj tripathi&#39;s interview and irrfan Khan&#39;s interview and each have  very different philosophies in general and all of em are great actors...
From All the Fake Khans I like Irfan and Nawazuddin <br>Real Stars of Bollywood <br>🌟⭐️💛🧡
Is he stammerer
Ang Lee and Anees Bazmi ;) :D
Did He say Mark Ruffalo ?
Come soon with a dashing film sir.... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23admiration">#admiration</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23love">#love</a> # reapect
Love you Anupama. Interview👏👏👏
The greatest Indian Actor of all Time. Hats Off. Love from Japan
Such an underrated actor
This is called a legend.
She has not  interviewed Kangana Ranaut, and New good  comers like Mrunal Thakur , Radhika Madan etc ... Discrimination ? Where as she had interviewed Janhvi Kapoor nd Nepo kids
Such a wonderful interview with Irrfan thank you so much Anupama .
Only one khan who is real actor and knows the craft....
I wished this interview could help me learn more about the personal rather than professional life about irfan sir.  However learning anything about any great personality like irfan sir is a pleasure....  Watch the interview of pankaj tripati sir on this same show...  It was really really nice.
Wish he comes back as soon as possible.
Your job has to enrich your soul
Idhar girega ya udhar girega🤣
Love to read comments when people like irfan sir do an interview. So nice to know that some people have no haters .you will see everyone appreciating him 😊
I love Irrfan khan.!
He looks like coach kabir khan (played by SRK) in his profile shots
I just wish he had spoken in his trademark urdu hindi.  His voice sounds something else when he speaks in hindi. Totally in love with this great personality.
गायछाप आहे तोंडात
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=676">11:16</a> He said the F word.
dude the guy in the beard is in every interview in the audience. Who is he?
Two words: Jordan Peterson
शायद ये interview हिंदी mein /hinglish mein hua hota बात ही कुछ औ होती.... Your emotion and thought come trualy in your mothertongue
Madam you are a great anchor, but one has to keep in mind that ,while anchoring, it is the responsibility of the host to make the guest at ease in front of the audience and with the host himself. I am not being critical about the way you conducted the interview, on the other hand I am a huge fan. It is just that Irfan sir was seeming, to me,  a bit constrained while speaking in english and more comfortable in hindi. It is quite evident that he is an introvert by nature and an occasional socialite. Many talented entities are introverts, and he is one of them. If the conversation would have been in Hindi mixed with English, we could have seen the brilliant Irfan Khan at his best. It is true that Irfan sir has given splendid Hollywood performances, but we all agree that the dialogues are given to him and all he has to do is deliver the dialogues and display his magic.
Every moment I was missing the delight of hearing Irfan in HIS language hindi/urdu

What&#39;s that anish bazmi thing
i pray to God that Irrfan soon recovers from his ailment and joins film industry back into action. Ameen
Get Well Soon....irfaan Bhai
He is legend
irfan bhai get well soon.we miss you<br>Love from Bangladesh.
What an amazing actor...
Respect you for what you are Sir.
Nariyal comment was really uncalled for..... But anyways when you become successful you become arrogant and don&#39;t believe in luck and muhurat, Jab lavde lagte tabhi sabkuchh yad ata hai..... Loosers
How do we get passes for these sessions!?
Hindi please😢<br><br>क्या दिमाग खराब करा यार ।<br>इतना अच्छा इंटरव्यू पूरा इंग्लिश में करवा दिया। क्या हो यार। <br><br>मेरे जैसे कई एक्टर्स इस वीडियो को बीच मे छोड़कर भाग रहे है।<br><br>ये भारत है कि अमेरिका।<br><br>यहाँ के ज्यादातर लोग हिंदी जानते है इंग्लिश नही।<br><br>ऐसे अंग्रेजी वीडियो को कुछ ही ल<br>लोग देखेंगे।<br><br>अगर ये हिंदी में होता तो इसके 10 गुना ज्यादा व्यूअर होते आपके।<br><br>प्लीज हिंदी में बात किया करे मेम। पूरे वीडियो में कुछ समझ नही आ रहा।<br><br>साला ये चैनल अंग्रेजो के लिए बना है क्या?<br><br>फिर कैसे नए पंकज त्रिपाठी और नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी आएंगे जो इस वीडियो को देखना चाहते भी होंगे तो नही देख पा रहे होंगे।<br><br>लार्ड मैकाले की मनोकामना को पूरा मत कीजिए।
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=816">13:36</a>, never ask Irfan if he can do it. Courtesy AIB we know that he can anything.....
A really intriguing and captivating interview.<br>However, would have been on another level if it was done completely in Hindi.
get well brother.
Something about him makes you just want to listen to him. Weilding an aura of a great story teller and craftsmanship. Get well soon Irfan.
Anupama you are great
Irfan is my favorite actor
Get well soon irfan sir. We all need u.. lots of love.
Abe ye Hindi me interview kyu Nahi rakhte Bharat me rahte ho bhasha angrezo ki bolte ho.
Love you IRFAN...... 💗💗💗💗.. Love from Tamil Nadu
Nawazuddin And Irfaan should be cast together
World best actor
Love him. So sexy 😍😍
Hindi cinema ki bate hindi mai karo ..hutiyon
Get well soon
I really wish Irrfan had spoken in Hindi. So much, so much got suppressed in trying to sound like Anupama and a certain kind of audience.
A polar opposite of Nawazuddin in his approach to acting
👍👍👍
Beautiful definition of Art<br>or<br>When we say &quot;When art happens?&quot; :-<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=920">15:20</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=972">16:12</a><br><br>Art only comes when you start marking things personal...<br>When you start reflecting on those things... Life around you... Life surrounds you....<br>Whatever you are absorbing as a Human being... And the. You some how communicating that observation... Your own point of you... About society, about humna beings through those stories...<br><br>If that is not happening.... Then art is not happening...<br><br>Art happen when you start reflecting... When you start personalizing things.....
Hard to Believe that He Is Fighting Cancer
invite Mr.  boman irani
Anupama Chopra&#39;s favorite words are &quot;Sort Of&quot;
Naiii rukiye na...
Irfan khan the legend...
Hindi likha hai to bola kyu nahi
Get well soon Irrfan 🙏🏻🙏🏻
I really like most of your videos and the personalities you interview. <br><br>The one thing that bother me though is no subtitles for Hindi videos. I appreciate the effort you put in adding subtitles to FC south videos. But I don&#39;t understand the lethargy in not adding subtitles to hindi ones.<br><br>Not everyone in India speaks Hindi. Forget about India, actors like Irfan has more fans around the globe.
Lovely actor Irfan. Just for his sake i saw the whole interview. Really felt irritated of that useless laughing &amp; overacting of the host
I&#39;d prefer if it was done in Hindi.
My respect for this man is increasing by the day!
irrfannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
please do it with directors as well.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=1285">21:25</a><br> dude in black shirt needs to get out of his slumber if he is to get any work at all! wasted space on someone who seems least interested.
Kya ye show sirf english janne walo ke liye h... Ye sb log to hindi wale h... Inhe boliye ki ye log film bhi english ki hi kre
So down to earth man..I really loved his words.encouraging and inspiring..Salute to Mr Khan!
What a delightfully charming lady Anupama Chopra is. I would so love to have an opportunity to meet her and listen to her for hours. She is everything that I would want in my girlfriend or wife; poise, intelligence, beauty, charisma and an effervescent smile!!! <br><br>Anupama ji I hope we can meet someday!
such a brilliant guy!! simply speechless
Please call Mammootty and Mohan Lal in your show. They are the greatest actors of Indian cinema.
I could listen to this man for hours. ❤️

what he is saying at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbjz76KV5ok&amp;t=2110">35:10</a> is so so true! See,it&#39;s not the popularity necesarily. It&#39;s the fact that he aims for something and achieved it and then the popularity is like a perk of all that. The intention has to be an honest and true to yourself, then you feel happy. But if you only want to become an actor to be popular because you think it&#39;ll make you happy, it wont. Naturally, every human wants love and acceptance. But the point is when you do something purposeful and then get love and acceptance is when it feels good. When you only do something to &quot;fit in&quot;or to only &quot;be liked&quot; then the misery haunts you forever. Great job Irrfan!

There&#39;s such a classy aura of that of an impeccable and non-pompous&quot;ustaad&quot; about this artist, such a magnificent man !!
Irrfan Khan the graceful master of acting and nawazuddin the valiant knight of acting!
I’love irfan khan. You are really a great 👍
Anupama&#39;s laughing is annoying as hell..
Irrfan Khan fan from Tamil nadu I love Irrfan Khan sir
Jesus I had blocked &#39;life of pi&#39; out of my mind. After the hyena attacked the zebra. I left.
Only some actors know acting in Bollywood and they didn&#39;t work for stardom.<br><br>this actor is a era of finest art of Indian cinema.
Amazing Nawaz.....most natural and no pretentions  the interview was a class in acting how to play different characters..
The beginning of many of Anupama Chopra interview with celebs &quot;I read somewhere that ..&quot;
This guy&#39;s thought are really sorted. He&#39;s retrospective about things around him. On other hand, anupama seems more of book writer than journalist.
worst part is that girl with fake accent!
the respected actor or the intuitive magician. love to hear him always.
i really love u irrfan
loved it, All hail Irrfan Khan.<br>Thank you Film Companion. :)
Watching this for 7th or 8th time... What fun to listen to a person who is not shallow and knows his craft !! Kudos to AC for asking the RIGHT questions !
What an amazing guy? and the kind of questions you as @anupama.. love the convesations... Please keep giving us more into the lives of these amazing people....
their was a time when such so called anchors and page 3 reporters dont even know what irrfan is , what are his potentials...he remain underated actor just because of such hypocrates who are attracted to glamour and show off only. But people themselves realized his potentials......<br>i feel do they really know anything about acting ?????
Hey Anupama and FIlm companion team: Could there be a FC unfiltered with Shah Rukh Khan please? Much much insisted. Even though none of his movie is releasing right now! Thanks
you are great and actor

This fucking Irfan Khan Jehadi brought a Pakistani actress to play in an Indian movie. Fuck this deshdrohi. Boycott his movies.
How can Anupama ask Irfan to react to Arjun kapoor? Duh!!!!
Anupama Mam Your Interviews Has Much More Depth And Sensitivity Than Our Film Industry
Cannot ask for a Super star better than Irrfan Khan. So very talented yet so humble. Thats his true success
Wow. How well he knows about himself. Amazing! Communication as it reaches exactly he is trying to convey..
So satisfying to watch this man, Bang on! answers to all the queries from audience<br><br>1) Artist is what when you start reflecting yourself in the character and if that click with the audience - means if that get commercialized - then you will get popularity. But that does not mean we can make it as reference tool. You should be out of this game and you should know what you really are and that is what this man is exactly doing.<br><br>2) Popularity is acceptable when you are getting it because you know you have done something good. You are satisfying with your work and getting all acknowledgment from fraternity and audience - but this part is two sided sward, this could lead you be compliance and restricted. But again... someone is aware of what he is and what he really wants then will not get affected by it. <br><br>** We need such artist who are aware souls and which makes them pure and realistic at the same time <b>*</b>
His acting in intreatment blew me ! Master piece
This guy isn&#39;t a mere actor, he&#39;s a monk.
Very intellectual conversation.
TRUE GEM OF A PERSONA THIS FABULOUS MAN CARRIES ...HIGHLY THOUGHTS PROVOKING  SHARING OF HIS EXPERIENCES THEREBY ENRICHING US <br><br>Anupama WOW she knows her job with ease and her persona is too comfortably amicable for the guests to open up so openly !<br><br><br>thanks FC Unfiltered for this one specially :) &lt;3
He is brilliant in the In Treatment series.
What I appreciate about Irfaan is that when he does interviews with foreign media he does not put up a fake accent like a lot of other Indian cutiyas do. You see ... if a person is secure in his own skin he does not have to resort to such gimmicks. I don&#39;t see Africans or people from European countries trying to put up a fake accent just because they are in an other country.
When the girl with the firang accent asked a question , the girl in front of her almost snapped her own neck trying to look back. That expression was priceless. LOL
