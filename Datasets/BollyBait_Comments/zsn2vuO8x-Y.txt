Farhan was effing the girl behind him in this scene during the shoot of this film.<br>I worked on this film. One of the guys in this scene walked in on him when he was getting a blowjob from her.. lol<br>Farhan Akhtar is one of the biggest hypocrites of the industry
This is one of my most favorite bollywood movies
❤
This scene is incomplete without Kabir&#39;s &quot;Binduuu Yaaaar&quot;
Farhan actually smashed him with that dialoque. hats off to you sir, brilliant actor
Husband wife relationship goes best with mutual understanding. Its about not asking permission but asking for opinion and better suggestions. Why man asks permission from wife on going with friends on trips and other things. There are many things wife husband should do mutual. Its all about priorities. Sometimes family is priority and some time work. There should be balance.
Shows how much difference it makes when men also raise their voice for women&#39;s rights. This movement will fail without the  help of men.
The girl saying i LOVE you 😂😂😂at the end 🔚
Indu yaar 😂😂😂😂
4+4 =
Farhan Akhtar is a brilliant actor 👏👏👏💖💖💖.
The best ever scene for women importance its necessary to understand this
Faran ne bilkul sahi bola ❤❤
So do I, Farhan Akhtar❤
Men shouldn&#39;t say &quot; i allowed my wife to work &quot; rather we should say &quot; i supported/ encouraged my wife to work.
No one literally no one went to watch the film in theatre but still that day it was my most favourite one...till date it is.
Why is Rahul Bose doing small 2-but roles like these. Terrible waste of a good actor. How does someone like Farman have more of a role than Bose
Every person&#39;s goals are important. Man and woman both. And let me tell everyone, nobody has time for anyone these days and nobody cares about anyone these days. So, for feminists (to those who only degrade people for their benefits), do whatever you want to do, just don&#39;t  to f**k us up. We just want to live for ourselves, and want to have a normal life. Period. 😒✌️
👌👌❣️ to the point
By &quot;maine ussey permission di&quot;, he meant he agreed to the idea of HIS WIFE starting a business because husband and wife are a unit. There&#39;s discussion involved. You can&#39;t just start a business abruptly out of thin air. I&#39;m sure even if the husband was starting a business, he would discuss with the wife.<br><br>Stop propagating hatred for men.
Everybody is talking how well put each character and set but did you guys notice, how nicley and impeccably Rahul bose performed here? Just too real at end of  his unpreparard reaction of realization and self esteem to be broken situation.
You would think that educated men don&#39;t think like this especially when married to equally qualified women, but I was shocked to hear my manager once say the same thing in a boasting way that he is a very good husband that he allows his wife to work. I was so obviously taken aback that I started laughing and blurted out, &quot;Permission? You really gave her permission to work? What else does she take your permission for?&quot;. He still did not understand his male chauvinism! It is sometimes so deeply entrenched that they are unaware that it is not cool to consider women lesser than them :D
Farhan ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Even Farhan acts so cool n sublime
If the husband wants to go out for some drinks with his friends and his wife allows it, that does not mean she has some kind of authority over him. I&#39;m sorry, but these dialogues are rather immature.
Sale allow kiya ko kitna negative le rha hai hutiya<br>Ye nahi soch rha hi suruaat to ho gya
If he used the word help instead of allow.. saara argument isi ka ho jaata
Altime favorite scene!
Mens like these🥺
Most adored fictional character
The girl saying i love you<br>This is what iam saying in my mind while he talking
Women rights 🤡
Brilliant 💯
Yes shadi ke baad ladki ko pati ki permission le ne kyu padti hai<br>Isliye single life raho mast raho khush raho ❤️❤️
I think the most subtle acting here is that of Ranveer Singh. Even without any lines, you can see the shift in his mood and his quiet anger in the way he puts down his bottle, the brief knowing look at his sister, and the tense jaw while looking down. He might be a weirdo, but dude is a pretty good actor.
Wow, I had no idea I did this, thanks 😂
Priyanka and Farhan chemistry is beyond amazing.. ❤️
Haven&#39;t seen the full movie so I&#39;m going to make a comment based to this clip. Allowing or giving permission to someone to do something is not a sign of authority but a sign of concern. If something happens to your wife tomorrow, if she gets killed in the middle of the road while she was on her way to her job, will the society blame her for not being able to save herself or the husband for for not being present.(Even if its not your fault, you should ask yourself as a man, if you will ever be able to forgive yourself for not taking a stand on her opinion and allowing her to do whatever the hell she wants, which led to this situation.) <br><br>Lets imagine another situation. If you and your wife are walking on the streets and another man tries to slap your wife&#39;s butt will you just stand there and watch your wife defending herself or will you protect her?? Because if you don&#39;t then your wife along with the whole society will spit on you. So why is it that you&#39;re THE man, THE lethal protector, THE husband when it comes to saving your wife&#39;s ass and keeping her dignity preserved but when it comes to taking a decision or having an opinion, you&#39;re a nobody???? Isn&#39;t that a sign of sexism and oppression against men????
Rahul Bose held this scene, the brilliance of this actor is beyond charismatic
What a fantastic and brilliant Zoya akhtar😘
I just love Ranveer&#39;s expressions!
I mean sab thk hai women rights wagaira hone chahiye but aurat ko kaam ya koi bhi job karne k liye husband ki ijazat ki zarorat nhi hai🙄😂😂like man are you serious?...tou phir shaadi karne ki zarorat kia hai?
Film me ye log badi badi haakte hai, aur asal me ye log ke rishtedaar hi sabse bade predators hote hai. Aur yahi log unhe passively support bhi karte hai. What a shame.
This is one scenario, there is also other situations where men don&#39;t let women work until the kids starts going to school, telling you have to take care of kids, the male ego keeps working, afterwards when he finds it difficult to manage financially, he tells her to go to work telling see&quot; I am not male chauvenist. You can work like you want&quot;, OMG!! Really?<br>Then she will have to start all over, all her peers would have reached higher designations and she would be forced to work with the younger generation. Imagine all she has built up, her hardwork, efforts for her career is gone drown the lane.<br>But yeah this is considered as a society norm.!!
Plz plzzz upload this movie
Wow I’m so glad see to all the comments here. Everyone relates to the impeccable acting of the entire cast in this scene. Everyone is appreciating the subtleties of the underlying tones. Virtual hugs to y’all!
This scene has its own fanbase ... There&#39;s no other scene I&#39;ve felt so relatable with ...
Guy : no woman worked in my dad&#39;s generation !! <br><br>Meanwhile his mom and Grandma&#39;s who literally did every house hold duties for these horrible jerk :  👁️👁️!! <br><br>Just because your mom didn&#39;t have business for herself doesn&#39;t mean she has no work !! She does everything to keep your house &quot;a home&quot;💙
भाई great work farhan 🙏🙏
It&#39;s an uncomfortably powerful scene
Why are you using a real name? Which idiots do Netflix hires?
This is one of my fav scene of this movie
One of the best scenes in the movie ♥️♥️👏👏🥺
I love this scene
I fucking love Rahul Bose
Farhan Akhtar stands up for Prianka?  Off course he will. It&#39;s directed by his sister so automatically he gets the hero role. Lol
Its really step up for Indian mindset but still the character here again needed a man to stand up for her<br>She didn&#39;t need that,she could have very well  stood up for herself
This whole conversation is really deep and a lot to learn from....love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Zoya Akhtar please make part 2 of DDD... I love this movie from bottom of my heart. I always have this movie downloaded on my mobile... You are amazing...
Vikrant Massey standing behind as supporting cast  and now on 🔥🔥🔥🔥..
actually he is sitting down tho!!
I can watch this scene over nd over nd still feel  the same relief same comfort and I love you with a sigh!
The girl saying i love u in the end was so NOT needed.<br>Ekdum unnecessary.<br>Bakwas
I swear I said I love you at the same time too!!!<br>Man that was so at point. Like I always forget to use the right words during a situation like that. But he didn&#39;t just use the hard-hitting words but also used the situation to his favour. <br>That character portrayed by Farhan was beautiful!💜💜
Why did they cut &quot;Indu yaar! &quot; 😄😄
but apart from movie Rahul Bose in real life do lots of work for gender equality
I love how manav tried to brag but got schooled instead
Farhan Akhtar is probably the most underrated actor in all of Bollywood and one of the most underrated in cinema history.
Best movie the best scene
Rahul Bose have grown as an actor
I &#39;allowed&#39; her to work. There, you have a narrow minded person who thinks they are wide minded.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsn2vuO8x-Y&amp;t=69">1:09</a> that girl is me 🤪
This flim is wayyyyy ahead of its time..acting,screenplay,direction everything on spot
Okay, so i have a question and i am opening my mind for the change so surely I have a question so dont judge me but guide me through it &amp; my question here is if I like to hang around with my friends or like to night out with friends why do i need to ask my partner because she hang around with her friend whenever she wishes to without asking me. She just tells me that she is going out with her friends, no question asked their. Or if I want to change something in the house, I ask her and obviously I got no as the answer or for let&#39;s talk about big decisions if I want to quit my job and follow my passion and do it from start why I need to ask her and she says no to follow my dreams. I have enough that could help me during my struggle of following my passion. So money is not the matter here. And if we talk about her making money so who will take care of children, who will teach those children about caring, love and affection that we got from our mother. I remember my mother who was always there for me and the truth is for that i love my mother more than my father. For me her working is not the issue but taking care of children is more important. And as a father I always try to be there for my children during their special days like their cometiton or sports events or even at night after dinner we talk about their day at school and the kids seems really happy. And for her working, I don&#39;t think of it that I am authority or something but we discuss about it though she like to work but she agree with me to take care of children. Because we don&#39;t like that our children should be brought up by other people. Because when they look back they won&#39;t see us the parents. They will not have a respect for their parents or the things we both are sacrificing for them. Atleast they get old enough, one parent should always be their for them all the time. And what mothers can do sorry but fathers don&#39;t have those quality. And I saw she is great and natural at it. And I am not. And I am natural at what I can do for them that is preparing them for their future. Making them learn life skills which I learnt from my father. So, explain me here what can be done of her working?
I just love this kind of mentality of men good one
the little girl wen said &quot;I Love U&quot; it depicts that every women in her life wants such modest men who can understand her , &amp; when she finds such person , she can&#39;t stop herself to  love or admire that men. i want to marry such perosn on the spot. haha :P
Lovely movie
Bhai kya baat boli h 🔥
exactly my point
Movies like DDD are called comfort movies!
Why women have to take permission for everything even after she has to take permission form her in laws to meet her husband
This is why I like this movie omg- even tho at first it looks like it&#39;s a typical rich desi family with rich people problems movie, if you watch long enough, you&#39;ll realise how this is the story of most of desi families— the mother in a marriage where the husband cheats but she doesn&#39;t leave him cuz &quot;aur kaha jayegi&quot;, the sister in an unhappy marriage but she can&#39;t leave him cuz &quot;log kya kahenge&quot;, the brother unable to follow his own dreams cuz the father wants him to do something else, and lastly the biggest relatable issue- &quot;asli cheezo ki koi baat hi nahi karta&quot;
This scene is legendary! I&#39;m seriously watching this movies all over again...
This scene represents moral corruption
The most backhanded chauvinistic statements:<br>1. I let her wear what I want. <br>2. I let her work as long as she takes care of my family. <br>3. I love a woman who can cook, because I love to eat. <br>4. I need a woman who can do both : &lt;enter one household chore and another &#39;modern&#39; stuff&gt;.<br>5. Women can&#39;t drive you know..m
I love this movie
A woman&#39;s job is to obey her husband. A man does have authority over his wife
Priyanka chopra jonas
INDU YAAR
after watching a few clips of DDD I realised that this is not a big bang power movie that people want to watch to escape their daily lives. This is a movie that depeicts problems that all section of society, male, female, rich, middle class, poor, everyone faces to some level or other. And no one really wants watch a misery that they are already living. But the dialogues, the discussions, the ideology behind the scenes are all very good and I like it.
“No, I don’t know what you mean.” 🫠 THAT’S HOW YOU BREAK A LOCKER-ROOM TALK CYCLE
Wow
And the fact that it is a guy who spoke up speaks volumes too. I mean, Ayesha can think and speak for herself. Another glorification of men and knight-in-shining-armor story only. When did this come out, btw?
Okay, now these nashedi, ganjedi , jihadi will give knowledge on women empowerment, keep your knowledge to yourself only.
Bollywood cleverly looking progressive while saying NOW women are being treated equally
Never realised vikrant Massey was in this movie
Simplest and most powerful talk about equality <br>Ive seen this scene so so so many times... still loving it <br>Beautiful movie...
Such a powerful scene!
Do I need a VPN for this one or Nah.
What nonsense. This is a movie scene. Why you putting real names in as if this was real. Nonsense
iske muh se ye baatein  achi nhi lagti
Probably the only good scene from this film.
This is one of those movies which I can rewatch over and over again!
the girl saying &quot;saranghaeyo&quot;...<br><br><br><br><br><br>(I know she said I love you)...😁
Как называется фильм?
wow expanding my horizons
cool.
One of my favourite parts of this scene is how farhan&#39;s character is the only one who speaks up. I remember i saw a comment by someone saying why is a man saying this and not the women present there, but it&#39;s so realistic this way to me because he is an outsider. Its the reason ranveers character and the other ladies dont speak up either, even if they hate it. Because theyre family. I preach about all kinds of equality and human rights to my parents and brother and my friends and strangers on the internet, but when it&#39;s my extended family i can&#39;t bring myself to do it. I freeze up and let them talk even if what they say makes me absolutely furious. I don&#39;t know why. I wish i wasn&#39;t like that. But i am. And so are a lot of people i know. It just feels like it isn&#39;t worth it to cause drama, like I&#39;m the one ruining everything, like i am guilty for it, when i am NOT. But the feeling never goes away. I love this movie so much because it&#39;s so REAL.
I DIDN&#39;T LIKE THE ENDING OF THE FILM...MAKES NO SENSE
It&#39;s their characters not them. Change the title to sunny supporting Ayesha
Anyone noticed Vikrant Messy behind ??
A wild number of comments are praising the fact that the women in the scene are &#39;able to witness&#39; these men discussing them or that saying that priyanka didn&#39;t need a line &#39;because her eyes do the acting.&#39; <br>y&#39;all are part of the problem. <br>I understand the relevance of this scene within the story, but women can speak for themselves and it&#39;s embarassing that we think it&#39;s progressive to just have the women in scene sit there as props while men discuss whether or not they should have rights.
World needs more men like him
This is my most favourite scene!
Why the hell is the title using their real names 😂 I thought it&#39;s referring to some real life incident where Farhan stood up for Pri 🤦
TWO MEN talking about feminism.. while the majority of the Women had no dialogues... very Meta.. kudos
Most underrated movie
Induuuuuuu yrrrr !!!
Totally right. I agree with what Farhan said. Everybody should have right to pursue what they want, being an adult and independent means having no need to wait for others permission to do something. So what if it gets wrong? Each step of it will remain as an experience. We&#39;ll be responsible for our own actions as we should.
What a scence
Caption defeats the whole scene! Man stood up for a woman! .. Netflix could have chosen the better title for the video
This is cancer
That&#39;s y he said  &quot; slowly and surely &quot; .  To be honest  there are a lot of people in the world who think like that and  u can&#39;t just expect them to change the values and customs the where raised in after getting lectured from a random dude . Things take time not all these people are bad people . What i really find pathetic is being indecisive  and uncertain about someone after u marry them , expecting them to change  because that way u don&#39;t just destroy u r own life but theirs as well but still u get to play the victim card because u r a women .
simp
I love him too♥️♥️
Rahul bose is the opposite of the character  role he played .. like in real life. Hahaha.
Farhan Akhtar stands up for Priyanka Chopra Jones I mean they are playing characters not themselves Netflix you know that right?
My fav part from this movie. The day I watched this scene was the day I realised the meaning of women equality. Hats off Zoya!!
@Netflix why real actor names and not character names in video title🤔
Look at the caption , wat a click bait .. no it&#39;s not Farhan and priyanka.. it&#39;s the character in the movie ..
This is the real &quot; what the farhaaaaan&quot; the redio people will understand
Things are always misconstrued or interpreted by people the way they want it to be. It is not black and white all the time.
Awesome clip..
That &quot;I love you&quot; girl is meeeee!!!!😭♥️✨
I don&#39;t remember the number of times I&#39;ve watched this movie<br>Sheer brilliance! Best of Anushka, best of Ranvir,  best of Shefali, can&#39;t deny everyone gushing on Priyanka 💖
This scene has my all heart ❤☺
This movie might have those designer clothes , jwellery , expensive cars , but this what this movie tells us that these things do exist in the upper class families , and how , inspite of being educated their thinking is still orthodox.When I watched it during my childhood I couldn&#39;t realise this thing but now I have learnt the about the message that has been given in the movie
U left ur wife for a younger woman, and ur preaching feminism what a hypocrite u r
Biggest Mangina of our country
❣️
😂😂😂
Atlast when she says I love you, uhhhh that&#39;s amazing ❤️
Indu Yaaarrrrr!!!
The BEST,🔥CAN&#39;T GET OVER THIS DIALOGUE
this scene made priyanka realize that she is in a wrong relationship and she needs an escape from this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsn2vuO8x-Y&amp;t=35">0:35</a> the lion and the witch and the audacity of this bitch
This remains my favourite Zoya Akhtar scene 😭❤️
Perfect situation explained in scene... People must understand this...👍👍
this scene like touched so many points like even to meet her own parents the girl has to take the so called permission but the boy just goes or just straightaway discusses or tells
this scene was so true cause many people /families say that we adapt to the new changes and we allow our woman to this but dude that is the case they don&#39;t need any permission  , things will be correct when woman dont need the permission to work or go out cause its their right
Equality ki baat toh theek hai but asal mudda toh journalism pe tha vahan toh vo Banda sahi tha.
I swear... I always watch those typical bollywood films like Radhe etc. thinking i will see something great... but im sleeping on movies like Dil Dhakane do. Its crazy. i feel so dumb. How brilliant is this scene.. how important is this scene. You can protect your childeren, but be proud of her or him when they achieve somethign instead of padding yourself on the back... especially when it comes down to equality.. you didnt allow anything... you stood right there where youalways shouldve been.
All this people like Farhan only talk nice nice things <br>They are the first to cheat and commit domestic violence
Why frahan is the besttt!!!🥺❤
Bloody feminist.
That is my favourite dialogue of all time 🤩
Toa bete ko b baap say nhe puchna chaye agar woh kuch b kare ....warna barabarii kaha hai aur haa agar baap betay ko thapad mare galti pe toa betay ko wapas thapad marna chayae ..warana babarbri kaha hai...very nice

You start hating Manav the moment he comes on screen, that&#39;s how good Rahul Bose has played the character, but never got the praise for that! Why are the award functions and critics so bias! 🥺
Indu yaar 😂
Well said
What rubbish!
Every women needs a life partner like sunny(farhan)....❤❤👏👏👏
Powerful scene!
Khayal jiska tha mujhe khayal main mila mujhe….
Well bois, y&#39;all know what happened later &amp; now you know how the simp fought his way thru🥂.
I loved this film sooooooo much❤❤❤❤❤. It&#39;s seriously criminally underrated 😕
This is one of favourite movie. And ofcourse farhan&#39;s character is my  ideal life partner.
I can&#39;t take off my eyes from ranveer❤ he looked fab, most handsome in dis film
Pakistanis need to watch this too.
Farhan Akhthar here is exactly what my dad says! ❤ Raised me to be a warrior! Damn lucky to have him as my father. ✨
Is hisab se to baap se bhi permission nhi leni chaiye na baap kisi ko kuch allow karne ka haq rkhta ha. Baat ladke ya ladki ki nhi hai par family me apne bado se baat krke hi acha bura smjhke decision lena hota hai. Aise to har koi kuch bhi karte rahe.
Mai to chahta hu meri bivi hi job kre mai ghar pr rhu😂
Why are u using there real name, instead use there reel name... Lol... It looks like indian news channel Headline.... Dekheye Farrhan Akhtar khade hue Priyanka Chopra Jonas k liye😂😂
That little girl saying I love you is so me ! I also want to say Farhan that after his dialogue 🥺❤️
Rahul needs a hell load of aloevera on that burn
Who is Jonas
I can&#39;t miss Kabir&#39;s smile after the girl said&quot; I love you&quot;
Aur yaha bhaiya ki 2 inch se bhi kam ego hurt ho gayi
Zoya Akhtar, i love and respect you so much.
Yeah true why women need permission for everything... She is individual beauty.. Just give them there freedom😍✨
It&#39;s not Farhan Akhtar standing up for Priyanka Chopra
My elder sister is working in Demlar (Mercedes) my younger one is working in ICICI....I am jobless....but trying to get soon.....Not putting it out there as an adv but letting people know gals are making ppl proud as always... :)
So we are not even addressing them as their characters now. <br>Had no idea Priyanka was married before marrying Nick Jonas . Does he know though? Also does she know that Nick used to be inside a game called Jumanji? And used to a horse in one of the parts? And does nick know the she used to be a boxer?
Same old feminism BS
I love the movie!
This was the best scene in this whole movie
This scene is amazing.... cherry on the top is the girl telling Farhan &quot;I love you&quot; after his gender equality speech aaawww.
Farhan is so underrated...sad
Use the character&#39;s name instead of the actor&#39;s real names in the caption. It looks really weird otherwise
If you think Manav is a distilled douchebag, Rahul Bose is a legend!
The comments section for any scene talking about women&#39;s rights in Indian movies is hilarious.  A LOOOOONG way to go, India!!
Most underrated Movie
Hi Netflix...<br>(OK guys I know I ain&#39;t getting a reply)😑
People will say he must be great at parties..
Bechare Baloo Bhaiya Sideline ho gaye 😢
When we are a family we need under standings. Values of cultural understandings.
i am just watching out of focus vikrant
कह के ले ली 😎😎😎😎😎
Fools. women empowerment doesn&#39;t exists. its a construct of the rich for the middle/poor class. Men don&#39;t like to work and take responsibilities then why would women. 90% of the population hate their jobs. If my wife would work and bring everything to home i dont need to work and i would be happy. But what my father/grandfather could afford with one salary now you need 2 salaries to do it. its for survival. and women have been brainwashed into it by teaching them work is love n life. But i have a solution. give everybody monthly allowance 1 lac inr. Then i would like to see how many women will say that &quot;yes, i love to work 9 am - 8 pm  or run business&quot;. Until then you are saying that you love to work because if you don&#39;t you can&#39;t afford food, mortgage, medical. so if you can work for free that is when you say &quot;i love working&quot; otherwise its just a necessary transaction.
Never ever get in to mess with a wise person.......because they will rip  off you with their common sense😊
It looks like he put fact on this movies and he girl trying to having facts that woman&#39;s are allowed to do anything that she want to do besides asking other to do it
Bt sadly Indian audience didn&#39;t like this movie..
That I love u was❤🥺
The way the girl says I love you
Bhasan dena is very easy..reality me apni auraton ko yhi saale burke me band rkhte hain
Idk why but i immediately clicked on this vid after reading priyanka jonas as if she&#39;s someone else now 😂😂😂😂😂
This scene wouldn’t have worked if RAHUL BOSE hadn’t acted like the typical MISOGYNIST. It wouldn’t have been the same had he not given that punch.
Best moment I love u loved it at the end for farhan
There is absolutely nothing intelligent about the scene..poor writing
That at the end girl did kinda tarka on the whole scene with &quot; I love you  &quot;
Im gonna just come out and say OHHH INDUUU YAAARRRRR
Favourite  yr love this movie osam
A woman will divorce a man if he is not earning. He will be called lazy, incompetent, loser etc.<br>But if a man asks his wife to get a job or asks her not to, then he is misogynist.<br>The 1st casualty of war always has been men. While women were sitting at the comfort of their homes, men went out to hunt, gather food, fight battles etc since mankind existed.<br>It is only recently when life has become easier and AC offices have come into the picture, women are also showing their urge to go to work.<br>How many women are willing to work in Mines, how many are willing to work as Truck Drivers or do any other risky job ?<br>Simps like Farhan would even get themselves pregnant to prove that they believe in equality.
I just love this scene, the best scene in the movie
This movie needs a sequel where they searche for Farah and we get to see her story
Green shirt guys mentality is wrong. But at the same time, its important to follow the passion and build better future.<br>Not to think tat equality is just drinking alcohol, smoking etc.
I remember my father in-law said that, did my husband allow you to work. I told yes , even I have allowed him to work.
Really trueth 😊😊.
In this scene, the real hero is Rahul Bose character...and only those women can understand who has/had/have a old cultured family but a supportive husband
Farah akhtar here act as SIMP
Propagandist
I think husbands should have control over women
Equity &gt; equality. If you know, you know.
So the guy breaks his regressive family tradition and while putting across the point utters &quot;allow&quot; and gets wrecked....<br>Cut the guy some slack atleast he did something progressive...
Faran akhtar mann🔥 , he is just too good , a great actor , director , singer. His films are worth watching.
Gully boy got appreciation (actually more than what it deserved) but this masterpiece got unnoticed. Its one of my most fav movies of all time.
This scene was amazing because it just shows that no man should have to give their wife permission to work, not just men with their wives but no man in general should have to make the decision on whether a woman in their family can work. If a woman wants to work, no one has the right to tell her not to. Its her life and she can do what she believes in without having others stop her.
Farhan&#39;s laugh when the girls says &quot;i love you&quot; killed me and brought me back to life
true, everyone needs a Farhan
Mere dad ki generation tak kisi aurar ne kaam nhi kiya....<br><br>Ghar ka kaam papa krre the? <br>Us kaam ki koi importance nhi hai? 😒
Male and females cannot be equal on all platform if so than why dont you organize a kabbadi match between them
&quot;...but I allowed Ayesha to run her business.&quot; And Kabhir put down his bottle and the Mehra siblings&#39; expression literally changed.<br>Here&#39;s the thing about best friends: there will be times when you know your best friend is going to make a point, that they will be stubborn about it and they were right, and it&#39;s going to be ugly and messy. And you? You let them make that point because they ARE right and your duty as their best friend is NOT to interrupt them even if you have to mop the floor afterwards.
Loved it❤️
in my opinion, Sunny kinda overreacted. Manav was just trying to say that he broke the patriarchy chain of his family by letting his wife step out of the house and work(which is actually a good thing!). It&#39;s just that his way of saying it was a bit insensitive that&#39;s all. Unpopular opinion but this scene kinda  promotes what you call pseudo feminism ie. extreme feminists can literally get triggered by any damn thing said by another person...
I love this scene❤️
This scene is extremely powerful and accurate.
Great scene ❤️
Such a marvelous actor he is... ❤️
These are &quot;actors&quot;....I repeat these are &quot;actors&quot;<br>They don&#39;t need the title of &quot;stars&quot;...let this title belong to them who are in the extravagance of limelight without doing even 5 percent of this work..<br>These are actors..who mesmerize us with their each and every role and everytime in the most unique way possible ❤️
Beat scene and yess it&#39;s the reality,my friends in laws broke off engagement with her after becoz they didn&#39;t agree for her only condition and that is to work, she has master degree but still in india men only wanna suppress women
These people are everywhere, they think they are doing a big favor to “allow “their wives so many things  even they count food and shelter ! And they think they came from a good family? But you know what? You can never change them, they are rotten as hell.
Bhad main jao tum sab....
Reaction of that lil gal is pure gold
I thought I&#39;m the only one who loves the way that how the cute small girl says I love you , but we&#39;re all equal ❤️
This is a perception... Not a concrete view.. And never will be one.. This is a far more complicated isssue than just an equality thing between men and women..
So true!
Dammmmm
Men or women are not equal it&#39;s a Third class approach.
Did anyone Notice Huma from Dice Media Webseries Opretion MBBS
Have you ever noticed this - the love rival of the hero is always shown as a bad person and around 8 times out of 10 he is shown as misogynistic. This ways they want the audience wants to hate him. They could have just shown these love rival men as good people but even then the leading lady like the hero and it would be perfectly fine. But nope.
Rahul Bose is a genuinely solid actor. He really made us all hate him.
I feel like watching this movie....why wasnt it hyped previously
Film ka name kiya ha
I hate people who feel entitled
Yaar, who talks like this
I miss that &quot;indu yaar&quot; from ranveer Singh in the last part to mitigate the tension in the air.
The girl in the purple tank top is Huma from operation mbbs
kudos to zoya akthar for this.
The next scene where she confronts him but then he says he&#39;s proud of her Thts whn she realized thts someone&#39;s told her that ,believed in her..wow so understated yet empowering 😲💕😘
Lol for him!!
ROASTED !!!!
The body language, facial expressions overall acting of all the actors in this scene is so genuine ...
Kudos to Reema Kagti and Zoya for their amazing script🥰🥰
True
Always my FAVOURITE scene from this movie...<br>Such a deep explanation in minute
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Underrated scene.
Priyanka is such a good actress..her expressions are so apt  ♥️
This is Zoya Akhtar talking...
Farhan was so hot in this movie and then after this scene he became 100% more attractive it&#39;s insane
Equality
Ef the woman rights, it&#39;s thier problem not ours, because women are not supporting men in anything so why men, we have to figure out everything on our own, it&#39;s just woman&#39;s nature they just want stuff, and they don&#39;t care about men so I would say that it&#39;s not about woman rights it&#39;s all about responsibility and no woman wants to take resonsibilty to change things and one way or another 99% of the time they offer themselves in exchange of money and luxury because it&#39;s really hard to take responsibility and change something thats why men do the all heavy lifting and that&#39;s the biggest reason that men are rulling the world in terms of economics<br>And you all know money is the power where the money goes power flows, so women need to focus on responsibilities, and also the big difference is that men have to figure out to get the money part right and for women it&#39;s pre define things and 99% of women don&#39;t want to change it because it&#39;s really hard....
That littl girl is all of us. Lmao
Saying a man whose Father abandoned a women and he himself left his wife for a Bimbo.
YESSS I LOVE THIS MOVIE
mast mast argument
Kya sahi bola re! Dil khush kar diya
Farhan just summed up everything in this 77 seconds....Amazing work from Zoya....👌
The expression on kabir&#39;s face when manav said phir mene Aisha ko allow kiaa was👏👏🤣👍🏻😁
The video was just 😘😘😍
This movie is the best!!!
Copy-paste dialogue! Thora apa damagh use karna bhi parh tha hai.
Soft porn for women 🥰
Looks like a scene from a Movie made by a Ugly Feminist or Something let me see who directed this movie.
is seen k chakkr me kl pura movie dekhna padd gayaaa
Indu yaar!
induuu yaaaaar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Such a buzzkill moment 😂
When the film came out, she was not Jonas yet so that struck me idk why
Seems like a definite movie to watch , talks on critical topics of the societies ❤️👌🏼👍🏽👍🏽
In theater I shouted at that girl shut up he is miiiine😂😂
Awesome scene
Look at all those Manavs who have disliked this video...wow..
Great movie,inspirationl
I just love this scene..
He is right guys no women needs permission because they’re not a little girl no more they’re woman.!
Hey it&#39;s a very good movie
I always watch dis scene wherever it comes my way
This is the best scene in this movie....❤❤
Farhan aur Rahul Bose mai se koi apne niji jiwan mai Hindi ne nahi bolta, ye baat saaf dikh rahi hai.
Since when did Netflix started writing titles like Eros 😂
Priyanka&#39;s expression spoke levels 👌 she nailed her role even in that one glimpse
What Rahul Bose implied was that his generation is ok with allowing this and probably the next generation would not need it. Ofcourse, it means in his generation equal rights for women is not common but maybe on some level he thinks the next generation would be ok with that. And then it would not be a question at all.
Kabir is just listening silently and going MERA BHAI! MERA BHAI!!! XD. Just that smile on his face he&#39;s trying so hard not to show speaks volumes about how he wanted someone to shut his idiotic brother in law up and someone finally did it!
All the people who says to girl&#39;s that &quot;what else do you want?&quot; Should know that we want a good mindset..... And that&#39;s what matters
The point here is valid. But for an argument sake, there is another perspective here. It&#39;s a shame he said &quot;allow&quot;and  that&#39;s not a very clever thing to say.<br><br>But if the girl had no prior experience in buisness, then the advice of her partner must be heeded by her as a mandate as in this case it&#39;s an established buisness that&#39;s been run for generations by the partner&#39;s father (not her father!). This would mean that the partner should have helped her grow rather than give her the title overnight on the pretext of empowerment. Most movies skip that! And that&#39;s what&#39;s the most important! The time and effort committed to empower! Most movie scenes like this just focus on a result and a realisation point, which according to me makes the message incomplete!
The way I went &#39;Indu yaar&#39; at the end lol but I am glad Netflix didn&#39;t include it here cuz half of the Ppl will be joking and laughing about it instead of talking about Farhan&#39;s talk.
That jst.... I love you  mde the scene lyk cheery on the cake ❤
The people running Netflix&#39;s YouTube channel calling her Priyanka Chopra Jonas...nice.<br>P.S: It&#39;s the right thing to do. I&#39;m just surprised they took care of that detail.
This scene itself is a stereotype. Ayesha didnt need Farhan Akhtar to stand up for her.
Farhan Akhtars talent in writing dialogues and bringing it into  performance shines here
Rahul Boss,Farhan, Priyanka.. Superb Acting..
the girl at the end is me..
I love what Farhan said. But the title of this video is a little misleading. <br><br>It&#39;s not Farhan who&#39;s standing up for Priyanka. It&#39;s the character sunny standing up for ayesha.
The line &quot;I love you&quot; is addressed to Farhan&#39;s character at least thrice in the 🎥.
It is just unconcious bias what Rahul portrayed...
Just look at Priyanka, the precision she has achieved in her acting is remarkable
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ brilliant scene
Rahul Bose is a heavily underrated actor.
I love you too...
Such things happen only in very rich families. In middle class, girls are independent and don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s permission to work.
This scene is very powerful in so many levels we can&#39;t even understand the depth of this scene. I remember when i started working there was a woman who was recently married she was kind of my mentor so I used to hangout with her after office too. I noticed this fact whenever she was going to be late or she needs to go somewhere she always take permission from her husband and in laws but when this same thing happened her husband only informed her. I never realised these two things for long time but later i able to differentiate both of them. We generally think we are modern and all but no we are not modern at all or independent. I was never against the concept of sharing but permission and notifying someone are way to two different things and both of them are wrong actually.
I love you 😍😂
Hermosa película, 👏👏🤗🇦🇷 Farhan ❤️
Netflix is so humble. Replies to the comments 😭❤❤love you Netflix
Ranveer bacha bn k acting k baap ki baatein an rha tha😜😜🤣🤣
Noori be standing at the back like : 🍻 let&#39;s partayyy <br>Lol
That moment bollywood try to be quirky in movies without actually raising their voices in reality when it matters the most. 🤢🤢🤢🤢
Perfect 👌🔥
Look at the brilliance of this scene. A woman in her 40s, a woman in her 30s, a woman in her 20s and a woman in her 10s. All witnessing, feeling and reacting to two men discussing this, alongwith another man and a couple behind listening eventually. And the tension is palpable, and every character relating with what Farhan is saying but as subtly as possible. Just 👌. Zoya Akhtar is amazing. The absolute best.
Its sad and bizarre actually these are some basic rights every human should have.. We women are living in such a world where we need to hold a placard, intiate a social media campaign,  start a rebellion what not ....just to  demand our basic rights... Why we need to ask society for basic rights they are not our creators ..
This one of my all time fav scenes.
I wish every man thought like Faarhan in the scene !
Farhan nailed it!
Arre, shouldn&#39;t have cut Ranveer breaking the tension of the scene by saying &quot;INDUUU YAAAAR&quot; at the end 😂👌
Ayesha
I love you! 😂😂❤❤
This scene changed my life for the better. 😍😍😍
Disliked from 3 accounts
I love you.<br>😂😂😂
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsn2vuO8x-Y&amp;t=25">0:25</a> take a moment to pause and look at Priyanka
Farhan is great ❤️
Best scene ever in any movie
😭😭😭
Nice video 📷📷📸
Please can we use character names and not the the actors&#39; names here coz farhan standing up for priyanka sounds weird and give people wrong ideas instead write sunny and ayesha
i can’t fully explain how much i love this scene
Somehow i relate with rahul bose in this particular scene<br>He was not intending to be a racist there so maybe farhan should not have been so judgemental about it
Priyanka when they started the conversation: Something horrible is gonna happen 😂
Probably the most awkward moment ever😂. This movie is amazing though❤️❤️
Ah perverts
Look at how natural and genuine every at actor on that screen is...it doesn&#39;t feel like anybody is overdoing it...I think the whole credit goes to Zoya... it&#39;s hard to pull off a film with such a huge cast...
there are two types men in the world.
Farhan akhtar voice is amazing..... An really nice msg tooo
Farhan is the most underrated actor ever PERIOD
Rahul Bose is such an amazing actor  he makes me hate his character soo much not only in DDD but also in Bulbul ❤
What an amazing scene from amazing movie! ❤️
arre bhadwo kabhi male empowerment ki bhi baat kr liya kro hum sale is feminism ki vajah se dabte ja rhe hai
Says the dude who cheated on his wife and left her after years of marriage 😂😂😂😂 I mean great point but seriously the irony
Add legacies please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
@Netflixindia add legacies on netflix please
Add legacies on Netflix please
This is what happens when a producer speaks.. The whole cast just listens 😅.. Best scene of the movie
Wow that&#39;s deep.. then I hear &quot;I love you&quot; 🥰😁😅
Priyanka doesn&#39;t need a guy to stand up for her. That&#39;s the whole fucking point. That as a woman she&#39;s independent
Me to Farhan : I love you.💕
I don&#39;t know why I am feeling awkward, as if I too am sitting with them.
This scene always makes me more confident.. and of course I love you Farhan..❤️❤️
Name:-Farhan Akhtar <br>Job Description:- Actor, Director, Poet, Lyricist, Writer, Singer, Producer.🔥❤️
Did you feel us?
This movie was so awesome
Dil dhadakne do is life❤️
This was the first thing I watch when Netflix was on free for 2 days.
Best scene ❤
This is one of the best movies I have watched
Farhan and Priyanka 💙💙💙
The hardest thing a small YouTuber can feel is when you wake up in the morning and nothing is changed on your channel.
Farhan is just so effortless sometimes that it just takes the scene to a different level.
Ohh even I love Farhan, he is the best 😍😍😍
Omg i love Farhan too. He&#39;s a good person. 🤧
This movie is so good. Man. Even if it was showing high class people, middle class gharon ki story is also not so different.
Priyanka didn&#39;t need a dialogue because her eyes did all the work!
That&#39;s why I like this movie , it covers every harsh reality of our society🙂🤭.
True words spoken 👏🏻🙌
Why only 127 comments till now..??
No promos for white tiger??
It should be renamed to &quot;Farhan Akhtar stands up for all the women&quot;
Lol!!! D same clip I kept it as a status on last yrs women&#39;s day😎By trimming,Editing(30 seconds k 3 clip) &amp; luk finally Netflix is here😂😂😂Soch milti julti 👌
This whole scene has my ❤️
I love Farhan ❤️❤️
Rahul Bose Man 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is literally the best statement made about today&#39;s state of feminism in the bollywood history and the way Farhan says it just wins my heart😭❤️
Rahul Bose literally nailed this, his character emancipation was impeccable....
One of my all time fav scene❤️ FarhanAkthar❤️
one of the best scene from movie ❤️
The day when men in our country will encourage women to be their best selves and not someone “under” them; that’s when perhaps we’ll witness a change.
I love you Netflix
Best scene
This is the most misunderstood part of &quot;modern humans&quot;, <br>The guy (rahul bose) is explaining his part by stating that women do get their due diligence in the society, to which farhan claims <br>why that has to come out of you, in a form of permission, he makes a point that women needs no permission from men...<br><br>Well lets take another hypothetical situation where a husbands independently takes a decision on his own, quits his business/ job, and starts roaming around the world without even discussing with her partner, will that be acceptable/responsible???<br>wouldn&#39;t it be wise to fist ask and discuss it with your partner before taking such decision?<br><br>Will you be using the same analogy, that why he has to take a permission from you before taking this decision???<br>The point is that the whole world always confuse feminism with equality, equality is crude idea, nature is not equal for male and female, by nature we have two genders (i know three, but in this context, two) and we have them for a purpose, for a reason.<br>You can&#39;t say women are equal to men, that&#39;s stupidity, have you ever seen god fighting with humans for equality???(have you ever even seen a god :D), We can never be equal &amp; feminism was not about making women equal to men, its about appreciating the feminine nature of humans equally to that of masculine nature of humans, real feminism is not that a women becomes the richest individual or most successful CEO but a world where we will equally respect and admire both the richest person and most successful CEO(Male) &amp; a successful mother, best home maker and the one who gives best values and virtues to his/her child as equal as both contributed equally for something best for society.
❤❤🔥
Irl the guy would persist to debate and then at the end would just say we have different mind-set/ perspective and what not.
love this scene! my favourite of all time
I was like damnnnnn burn🔥😆
The thing that he says was so small but so huge in it. Every man who boasts about giving their wives permission to do a job must hear it once at least.
His character stands up. Last I checked you people blamed it on the mindset of the character everytime there s a controversy right?
&quot;sab protest kar rahe hai toh kuch galat hi hoga&quot; <br>              - the same dumb guy
Most underrated movie
Farhan akhtar❤️❤️
The writter is the one who deserves that i love you

♥️
This truly shows what men thinks when it comes to women.. they don&#39;t difference btw allowing and having her the rights.. beautiful scene!!! ❤️❤️👏👏👏
Kid : I love him <br>Me : You are not alone 😂❤️
I just saw this scene on the tv now and i found it now.
Hey.. guys can we start a thread here.:- Song- Faded(Alan Walker)<br><br>Okay.. I&#39;ll start.<br><br>.You were the shadow to my light.
Priyanka and Farhan is the best on screen pair ever😎♥️♥️♥️
I love him😍😍
Most favourite scene in the movie. Truly loved the way he keeps his point and subtly puts him down. Well written and executed 👏👏👏
Everyone after watching this..Oh Farhan❤❤..But for me Zoya❤❤❤..What a director..
The girl saying I love you at the end never fails to bring a smile on your face .
❤️❤️❤️❤️
The little girl who said &quot;I love you&quot; in the end spoke for all us &lt;3
To The Early Squad Reading This: Sending Virtual Hugs to everyone who need it stay safe read my name💖

If its upto me I&#39;ll declare zoya as the queen of Bollywood
Greatest scene ever
Farhan ❤️❤️
One of the best movies of Zoya Akhtar! Farhan nailed it!❤❤✌
wa
Right 💪✊👍👍👍
This thing is GOLD ❤️❤️
Priyanka Chopra is the most talented actress in Bollywood.
Farahan akhtar is really respect women 😍😍😘
PREACH!
Every human after watching this - <br>              -  &quot;I  LOVE  YOU&quot;.
Men mentality - Giving bare minimum to women and calling it women empowerment.
