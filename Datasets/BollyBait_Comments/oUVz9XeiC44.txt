Ranbir now , &quot;aab bol , bolna mc&quot;
Sach hi bola hai...real ranbir k kisse nhi sune kya.
Ranveer is right.<br>If Deepika, Ranveer, Ranbir and Alia is in the same movie, it is blockbuster before releasing😂<br><br>i mean, who would want to waste the opportunity to see them in one frame
Deepika is looking same as 2010 as today.<br>but on the other hand,<br>Ranveer singh has become whole different human😂
Ye khud ko compare karti h rahis baap ki bigdi aulad...
Deepika Padukone will end her story of her dead father now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUVz9XeiC44&amp;t=107">1:47</a><br><br>Damn…He sounded pissed lmao
❤️✨🤞💜
I appreciate how Katrina has kept her out of the topic about her and ranbirs relationship followed by breakup in kwk so graciously. She is such a dignified women
Ranveer respects everyone including women. Not Ranveer but Deepika is so lucky to having a husband like Ranveer. However Deepika is the most suitable guy for RK. Oh god!! But DeepVeer is the bestest.. ❤️
It’s high time koffee with Karan also moves on lmaooooooo 🤣
I have always wondered why actor and actresses think there would be any controversies over their opinion. There are really great actors and actresses in the world who are well known of being outspoken and straight-forward as well as well-appreciated and loved by all the other performers and the fans in general. I was shocked when a public who people looked up to they skim a question from answering because that may create a controversy. I was thinking that is really rubbish.<br>I have been a fan of several people after their performances, truly I never liked them as a person. Some performers are really well-spoken and I have listened to their speech for hours and over and over again. I want a show if possible to create where all the performers will speak of their minds and there should be any boundaries. <br>They need to speak of their minds otherwise, it will be threatening for them. I would not ask them to provide numbers or ranks, just will ask them to share the constructive criticism about a performances. What they do in their personal life should not be our concern anyway.
Anyway evrything has got finished and changed bt i wish only one thing that oneday that big day ranbir realize that no one can love him like deepika did or do❤❤❤❤❤......... She never get bored of spkng abt u yet... U always ignore her and haven&#39;t given her any attention for her love towards u... U been always back of that katrina who evn dont cares a shit for u....U were like oh god plzz keep away this deepika frm me forever🤷🤷🤷..
Oh god deepika said ranbir cheated,
Dp and sonam looked so good in this i wish they would bring the show back.. actors were a little bit free on the show
When will this be back???<br>As soon as bollywood is back it should be back
Enjoys

I can hope to die and say to god that I love Sonam Kapoor.
I love how Karan us trying to start beef and Ranveer is like NO BUT  PUT US ALL IN THE SAME MOVIE
Nonsense karan

The show should be tea with Karan lol
Ram leela first offered to Sushant.
Star plus please cancel the show with Karan Johar <br>as you can clearly see how he promoting nepotism through the show.  KaranJohar has a major hand in destroying Sushant Singh Rajput.  There should be equal opportunity for everyone. Please don’t promote Karan Johar’s personal agenda with this show.
Why called these p stars
Both alia and karan insulted deepika silently.<br>🙄🙄
Sonam Kapoor- Sun-Mrigshira, moon-It’s showing Satbhisha but i knoe its Ardra👿<br>I don’t knoe Mrigshira is responsible for this dumbness or Satbhisha....whatever nakshatra it is may be DESTROYED in August2020👿
Why Alia is behaving so dumb...Might be this particular clip is that way...She is not that bad...Kya bakwas🙄<br>Send good feeds plz Hacker😂

Teachers , nurses  , soldiers , policemen , line men , honest tax payers , labour class , sewage cleaners , doctors etc etc there is a big chunk of society who deserve more attention , more respect , more money and comforts .<br>But we as society choose to celebrate pretention , fakery and illusion , wow I love these film actors &quot;stars&quot; and &quot;heroes&quot; .<br><br>I am sure u guys wil ask me why you are here watching all this then ?<br><br>Well , for the platform , all we get as a platform is this comment box <br><br>Today&#39;s reality <br><br>Am I risking my life by serving the community by going to hospital daily which is swarming with corona ?? Answer : yess <br><br>But have I acted in a dummy film ??<br>Answer : No <br> <br>So sit back and type on YouTube comment box u are not important 🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUVz9XeiC44&amp;t=31">0:31</a> you stole my heart, I wish I had a smile like yours♥️😍
Publicly announcing that Karan Johar and Sonam kapoor are the most showing off people , like brands, luxuries , family background, don&#39;t know about people but  I hate them for their behaviour towards  public. Akshay kumar is just opposite of them , he is straight forward.
Ranbir is a playboy.shame on him!!
Watch CA CS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRQ8BJ3RU8g">https://youtu.be/nRQ8BJ3RU8g</a>
For first time I agree with Sonam.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂 ranveer singh
They should bring Ranveer and Deepika together♥️
Ranveer you are super duper handsome awesome loving caring and most talented person in the world 😘💕❤️🥰😍
Love the way you are ranveer ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ranbir love you😘
Ranbir NAAAAAAAILED IT !!!!!<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s HIGH TIME that coffee with karan also moves on.&quot;<br><br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUVz9XeiC44&amp;t=19">0:19</a> <br><br>😁
What Ranveer said about KKHH2, I think I might want to see that!
Koffee with Karan needs to move on from the RK-DP  relationship!..its reallly high  time
In logo ki maa kab chudegi poore desh ki maa behek ek ho gayi hai
Still not sure what attracted Ranveer to Deepika... alas. I hope he is happy, and she doesn&#39;t eff this up.
The fake feminist....all talk no action
Ranveer&#39;s fashion, we all tolerated in the beginning. Today, it is amazing. He has an identity and he doesn&#39;t care. He enjoys it so much that we love it now!
Dayum deepika ♥!
How does anyone tolerate Karan Johar??
Ranveer and Deepika looks very fake.
Is it just  me who&#39;s getting random kwk videos on my YouTube recommendation
It seems like Alia likes to be friends with Ranbir&#39;s ex&#39;s
Ohhhhhh ranbir that was a good one
Alia is so cute 🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤
i loooove deepika . not just  coz she&#39;s no1 heroine or she&#39;s very pretty . i love her emotional side how she look how she talks how she sweet how she handled her real and reel life she had up&#39;s and down so many years <br><br><br><br>i love you
lol,,,,,,,,,,lady
As Ranbir said, Koffee with Karan needs to move on from the RK-DP  relationship!
I like the conversation which is typically East indian English language accent
