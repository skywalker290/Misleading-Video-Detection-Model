Cheezon ki kami toh aapko bhi nahi he mom.., magar kya aap khush ho ? Is the question
And my is like mere liye tum bche stand lo , against your father.
What a scene !!
at 35, you realise the mum is right. Also, love how Shefali Shah is always on edge...hahah
Aur meri maa kehti hai ki career bnao agey chalke single bhi rahogi toh fark ni padega 😂😂
Not at any moment, they looked mother and daughter
Parent hamesa hide karte hai ignore karte hai
Aisi ldkiyo ko ROBOT se shadi kra do .
Thanks to Karan Johar (KJ) for introducing &quot;VIBRATOR&quot; thru Kiara, the purpose of living shouldve changed for Indians, then why this race to get settled only once in life?
Last lesson was amazing.
Appni marji se subject Tak nahi choose kar ny nahi dete...
My God! What an invalidating and dismissive mother! She tolerates shit from her husband and is preaching her daughter to do the same!! She is literally pushing her daughter into toxicity instead of being the support that she deserves.
To all who relate to women like the character played by PC. She is married and has a kid and doing well for herself and her family. If she can’t follow what she says about women freedom and self dependence why should you then ladies. At least get to her status and then extrapolate her thoughts and context. Women blindly following other women’s thoughts and don’t see if the context of their statements apply to their own lives end up being bitter and more subservient to lesser people. Be careful out their ladies.
I feel this upsect
What a piece of acting from Shefali mam...god bless u mam...
Waiting for Dil dadakhne do 2 ✨✨✨
After this movie was released divorce rate in India just sky rocketed. <br>Which is a good thing in a way but bad thing for the society and well being of our children.
Sefali shah&#39;s carecter is like a selfish, opportunistic, always run behind her carecter less spouse and try to act nothing happened, she doesn&#39;t have any self-respect, doesn&#39;t understand own children aspect, their feelings, their needs, how  could she talk to her doughter like &quot;mujhe nehi sunna hai tumhari problem&quot; maa nehi sunegi toh bacha kiske paas jaigi apni baat sunane,. I hate that carecter too much.
End line is must in india
In our country, love and respect in a marriage is the last priority. People are more interested in stability and growth of the family.
I had a mother who was totally against living in a love and respect less marriage which was financially safe and secure for me. I put up with it thinking I will be spoiling my children’s future. Basically I was not confident about my “ self “ which became distorted after marriage. I had the guts to walk out with my two children who were on the cusp of teenage at the time.  I lost ALL friends and all of the husband’s family spewed so much of hate and animosity on me for walking in my marriage. I have done extremely well for myself now and also my children. The best decision I ever made.
&quot;Mall se shaadi karwa deti.&quot;😂 Exactly man. Rishte dekhne k time pe bhi ladka kitna kamata hain, degree blah blah. Mentality kaisa hain, ghar pe women ka opinion rakhne ka space hain ya nahi, peace of mind milega ki nahi no one is concerned.
Bitter but truth🙁
When a mom says<br>&quot;Apne career ko chodo aur ghar per dhyan do&quot; <br>Then its over. You are no more a concern for them. They simply dont care. 🤣🤣
&quot;Mall se shaadi karwa dete meri&quot; has a separate fanbase🤣😂
Shame on such parents who treats their own children like this. And use them for their benefit
shefali nailed it as a bitch in this scene😃😜
Turkish hamam
This family is showing completely opposite of truth.. my mother would never talk to me like this.. she&#39;s so harsh to her daughter. <br>Absolutely wrong!
But sadly even today mothers are saying same to their daughters when they share their problems. They never tell them to be independent but to be dependent on her husband.
Chuthyapa feminist movie 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Kyu k deshi parents ko lagta hai bache yani nalle..or nallo ka koi bharosha nahi 🙂
I&#39;m so glad my mum (and dad too, but this scene is between a daughter and mom) supported my decision to go for a divorce... Because she said right from the beginning that if you ever feel threatened, come to us...
They all got chance to bath with miss world
I guess the reason of increasing marital rapes, suicide of married women etc,is that there is no one with them to share their sorrows....
I hope heroin log real life me b aesa sochti real me to peso k lie ki h
Shaadi koi race nahi hai jo finish line tak pahunchna zaroori hai.... well said... give importance to things that deserve you to live life with no regret.....
Terrible mother
Budhiya pagla gayi hai kya?😂😂😂
I don&#39;t know y but everytime a daughter wants to disclose something after marriage she is just asked to shut up....
Kaisi maa hai <br>Sharam aani chahiye
The mothers excuse was so stupid, uk being a single mom is the most difficult task, than adjusting with a husband who has an affair, or is abusive.... From personal experience, single mothers really struggle a lot, but those mothers are actually women with dignity, and women who just adjust for the sake of a so called successful family life, are just cowards who can&#39;t face the world without a man.
They&#39;ll say don&#39;t get in relationships until you&#39;ve reached a good point in career and when they do, they&#39;re married off and then career is not important her family is.
Shefali is a very good actor. Here Shefali overshadow Priyanka by her acting skills.
Thank god my mom is not like that
My uncle like if you doesn&#39;t know cooking Laundry sweeping how u will survive in ur husband house.<br>He never told me earn money if u  doesn&#39;t know cooking u can keep cook, doesn&#39;t know laundry buy washing machine, he never asked me how u will survive in the society if you doesn&#39;t have money 🙄.
The mother played a fantastic role, omg. <br>Everyone is against her. Her acting skills are next level.
Such a fantastic actor Shefali Shah... and you realize she is just 10 yrs older than Chopra.
Society is unfair, world is unjust
Kaisi mom hai khudki beti feelings bhi nai samajhte
Damn that narrator tho...so on point man!!!!!<br>So true!!!! It&#39;s like they have an attachment syndrome &amp; then we get it when we become parents...<br><br>Am I the only one thinking this??
Forshadowing Nick Jonas 🥰
Toxic parents are worse than murderers!!
Last voiceover was a good message
These are women ( shefali shah) who support patriarchy by denting on their own  daughter&#39;s esteem and self worth. A system can&#39;t exist without the support of both the genders.
I hate Neelam Mehra like hell. ... what the hell  man!

after reading the comments i feel my beloved friends ..mujhe samah me aaya  ki ...pehle toh shaadi mat karo, agar karo toh ladki se ladke se mat karo kyun ki problem male gender se hai...aur agar male se karo ... toh jitne jaldi ho sake divorce le lo... sabse pehli baat maa baap ki kabhi mat suno. kyun ki unko pata hi kya hai ???? zindagi me??? sirf janam diya paala posha , padhaaya .(tab jaakar hamare andar itni akkkhal aayi ki  dont care parents) bassss.....itna hi na??? janam dene k baad har koi parents apne bacchon ka bhala bura toh dekhte hi hai na doston ...haan ek baat hai ..<br>ki aise kai laawaaris bacche hai jinke maa baap kaun hai unko pata hi nahi .... good na ...bada hokar usko ...lecture nai sunna hai parents ka.... aur gussa nahi hona parents par ki. tumhara lecture aur gyaan hume na chahiye bhaiya ...
Every guy wants his wife and girlfriend to do job but he just dont find her career to be career .He is selfish and just think about his career .😓
Chutiya movie Ka chutiya scene.
Sad but true..... parents shouldn&#39;t always say that work it out ..  if there&#39;s genuine problem and the relationship is not making you happy it&#39;s  better to have divorce Rather then sacrificing and suffering
Desi maa-baap be like - &quot;shaadi mein itna kharcha hua woh sab waste&quot;, &quot;log kya kahenge&quot;, &quot;relatives ko kya jawab denge &quot;? &quot; &quot;Hamare time pe hum logo ne kitna adjust kiya &quot; 🙄 . Ranveer singh is right in saying (to his mom) in the film &quot; aapke paas koi aur jagah hi nahi thi jaane ko&quot; . The fact is women in those days used to adjust coz they were not financially independent to take care of themselves and children, if they divorce.

Bollywood is so stupid and cringe, that for some reason I agree with the mother than that stupid actress.
Narration main buhat hi stupid baat ki hai.. shair kay half bachhay jangle main maaray jaatay hain kion kay.. shair ko fikar nahi hoti.. kion kay woh janwar hota hai.. insan mushkil say paalta hai apnay bachay ko.
What a fabulous scene
Movies like these and other forms of entertainment are the biggest reasons of the increase in failed marriages in Asian households.. A smart, modern-day girl would be brought up well enough by her parents to know how to maintain the balance between work and home. Yes, men should not confine their women in any way, however, women need to value how important it is to run a house and raise kids they way they should be raised.
in our Desi culture, Shaadi is just a business deal. Its no more relationship between humans. Its full of protocols and criteria. Its done and interpreted by just a piece of paper where the most important is annual package. Thats it.
My mom is exactly like her... She thinks the same, like her mother.
Life koi race thodhi hai ki finish line tak pauhachna hi hai
I don&#39;t know why but I cry everytime I watch this , you see there&#39;s a woman disrespecting and degrading another woman . Men are not responsible for our downfall in this country as much as ourselves are. Being a mother she should have heard her , supported and guided her. If there&#39;s even a single mother reading this please be respectful to your daughter and please listen to her when she wants to talk . Don&#39;t blame her , just try to feel how important it is to be happy , married or unmarried or divorced . Life isn&#39;t all about getting married and having kids and forgiving him all the time just because he&#39;s a man and he can buy your daughter stuffs . Materialistic affection isn&#39;t love. Please try to understand this .
😀😀😀😀<br>Bollywood wale bas ek pehlu ko dikhate hn dusra pehlu bhool jate hn<br><br>Baseless
The family looks so modern but there&#39;s thinking are so dumb 😡😡😡
Wonderful movie. All actors have put up a good performance.
It&#39;s interesting that ironically it is actually easier to ignore infidelity and go on with life as opposed to disrupting stuff, standing up for the right and fighting legal battles
having a mother like her is a curse!
I don&#39;t understand how she married tht shorty in first place.. And how can u stay in a loveless marriage n be miserable n allow your daughter the same? <br><br>Well I am a very disrespectful of a person I wouldn&#39;t have been such push over like Priyanka here. I would have had my way anyway w my mouth bcuz IDGAF.. Been nice to parents n ppl around me n it resulted nothing but in being deceived.. So lesson to learn never be too nice n ALWAYS stand up for yourself
Kuch dino baad Jonas ka bhi same case dikhega.
And see where she is now after divorce.....<br> Priyanka Jonas
This is the problem of our desi parents they never try to understand there kids <br>Seriously yhi sunne ko milta h bht acha ghr h sb kuj unke ghr mai ldka ki job bht achi h kbhi kisi cheez ki kami nhi hone dega like seriously 🤐🤐🤐🤐
kya yaar last waali line
My mom like pc mom in this movie
Why woman is the biggest enemy of another woman ? Why people think bout society more than their own kids or family ?
Awesome Awareness
Is it amir khan voice in background at last??
So true my mom also used to talk me like this. 🙄
It&#39;s not about career, it&#39;s about life.<br>(Note:- I don&#39;t mean career equals to life, by life I mean way of living)
Hate the character. Love the actress . Shefali shah❤️
This movie is such a great movie.. Sad it is underrated
No mother talks to her daughter like this. Specially when she is talking about divorce.
Very perfect portrayal of how a typical Indian mom behaves. They won&#39;t accept the wrongs and at the same time  also want their daughters to continue their legacy of bearing sufferings all along without breaking free.
My mom is like life mein koyibhi decision lenese pehle always be free and independent which makes u strong to face the consequences and always put ur self respect first than anything else..except family....family mistakes should be healed by everyone in the family only
What a sad excuse of a mother!! You are suppose to listen to them and understand their problems. My mom told me the opposite, she told me that “if your husband misbehaves with you, always remember you have a home to come back to, as long as your parents are alive, you have a home!” I am so blessed, I have taken them for granted but they have always had my back. May Allah give them a long life!!
This movie is so underrated
They actually look like mother &amp; daughter... Wtf 🤪<br>Similar facial features..
Hmlog janwar nhi hai jo apne aap ko janwar se compare kre. Insaan hai.....
Very true
In reality ... first get ur career set....become financially independent by being dependent on ur employer for increament and leaves and work like ass ..get some loans so tht u hv aim to pay EMIs...then get some health problems like BP sugar etc then get married 🤪
Bollywood is corrupt. Inse mat sikho kch bhi
i hate her mom in this movie
I m shocked by her mothers talk
She&#39;s just like my mom. And I&#39;m a doctor.
wow what a mom hats off to her
What a lovely dialogue... It is....  Mall se Shadi kra dete Meri... Kbhi kisi cheez ki kami nhi.... Pdti.
I don’t understand why this movie didn’t do well. This is one of the best movies showcasing Indian parenting ..
Yha b aisa hi h... shadi ko 3 year ho gye but still my in lows NVR let my husband to make any decisions &amp; even I can&#39;t make decisions, she always said baccha baccha he is 32 &amp; we just had child , never let my husband take any responsibility sochti hu jb ye log nhi hoge jb responsibly aayegi to husband handle kaise krege bcoz he don&#39;t know anything
جانوروں کا رہن سہن پسند ہے تو پھر جانور بننا تھا  پھر ہم بھی کہتے یہ کدی کا بچہ کتنا خوبصورت ہے
Shifali is an amazing actor!! Desi parents r not ready for this...😂🤦
Akal se pehle toh inke choot kuli hai bf se 😂
Oh god Desi Maa Baap😂😂😂😂😂
Priyanka Chop Ram
Tabhi to bacho ko drug nhii lene dete🤪😂😂
My case is completely  opposite.😜
When priyanka said mama see the expressions of Shefali..... Ab kya ho gya..
It&#39;s all destiny really... where we are born, happy or unhappy, married or divorced or single, etc. etc., we are all bound on a path already set by fate.
All this is so sad and true, but I have lived in the West, where youngsters live on their own terms. Trust me, it has its cons. Unfortunately, no lifestyle is perfect. <br><br>Collectivism is suffocating but gives a sense of security. Individualism on the other hand gives you the freedom to make your decisions even with your lack of experience and wordly wisdom, but when those decisions go wrong, there&#39;s no one to support you.
Very true, abhi bhi mere parents ko meri akal pr doubt hota hai, when I am a mother of child
Last lines were so good🔥

Right thinking
Promotion of divorce , people can never understand leaving relationship is easy but ever thought of next one ? Would that be easy , the answer is don&#39;t know . then better sought problems than to leave relationship
😭😭 mere saath bhi aisa hi h, mujhe kaha jaata h ki shaadi karo warna society kya kahegi ki ladki se laalach hoga jo abhi tak shaadi nahi ki, ya rishte acche nahi milenge is age ke baad, isliye meri padhai mai interested nahi h....aur kehte h ki agar job karni v h to wo un logo ( sasural) waalo ki marzi hogi ki karaye ya nahi...............  Mujhe nahi pata tha ki padhai mai din raat mehnat karne ke baad aise din dekhne ko milenge. Life mai koi na koi to supportive hona hi chhahiya..Shayad isliye jo log itne great hote h unke peeche zarroor koi na koi supportive insaan hota h, jaise Ronaldo / Kylie Jenner ki mom. Logo ki asli jung bahar se start hoti h, par hum jaiso ki ghar se hi, phir chhahe wo parents ho ya sasural waale.     Sach kahu to mujhe ab suicidal thoughts v aate h, par phir wahi baat ki log bolenge ki ek hi ladki thi wo bhi aisa kar gai Shayad kuchh galat kia hoga , sochenge ;ya parents ki izzat aur khushi ki wajah se kuchh nahi kar paati.<br> Ek ladki ko yahi sikhaya jaata h ki hamesha khud par control rakho, logo se acche se baat karo, lekin kabhi uski khushi ke baare mai nahi sochha jaata ki wo kya chhati h. <br>Maana ki sabhi sasural waale bure nahi hote , lekin sabhi acche bhi to nahi hote. Meri ammi ne khud itna kuchh zhela h apne maayke mai v aur sasural to unhe jahannum mili thi... Jo meri daadi aur chachao ne milkar unhe itna dukh diya😭😭............................aaj unhe ek eye se kuchh v nahi dikhta.<br>Hum jaise logo ka talent hi mar jaata h, kyunki hum apne liye nahi logo ke liye survive karte h😣 Mujhe to bahot drr lagta h ki mai aage kaise jiyungi aur kitna khud ko andar se maaru?   <br>Sach batao to jab kisi ko kuchh bante huye dekhti hu to bahut proud feel hota h ki chhalo koi to h jo apne sapno ko hakeekat mai badal sakta h.<br>Kuchh log jo apne rights ke liye ladte h jaise Heena Khan, Nora fatehi.. Hat&#39;s of to them..<br>Heena ko film industry ke liye sakht manahi thi aur aaj wo kaans festival tak ke liye jaati h, Nora ko dance ke liye manahi thi, lekin aaj wo apne dance ke liye jaani jaati h.<br>Lekin mai kaise kya karu , drr bhi lagta h kuchh step lene se..........Akhir kyu ban gai h ye duniya aisi. Kyu h abhi bhi kuchh log aise , kya religion, caste, izzat ke naam par ye hamesha hota rehega? <br>Actually, parents ki v galti nahi h-- wo b darte h jis tarah se mahol dekhte h. <br>Waise hi sab bolte rehte h -- Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao , lekin kitne hi cases h jo dil dehla dete h. Kyu hum iske liye strict law nahi laa paye.  Mujhe yaad h ki jab maine ye question school mai puchha tha to bataya gaya tha ki is law mai amendment laane ke liye bahut kuchh karna padta h aur bahut time lagta h......par ek baar sochh kar dekho agr itna hi kuchh karna h to shuru to karo kam se kam , kabhi to result aayega iska bhi.....😟 Taki log sudhar jaye aur 1000 baar sochhe kisi ke baare mai, aur sabhi safe aur khush rahe.....
Truly blessed are children whose parents support their kids and don&#39;t compel them to curb their happiness n live a forced life to look good in the eyes of society
Bilkul shi dialogues...
And my mom🤣🤣🤣 when i said my bf said I&#39;m skinny my mom.says yes that&#39;s true.  But Don&#39;t marry him,  actually leave him,  focus on.your Career, she will never give me the permission to get marry unlit i secure my career.   😑
shefali shah is a brilliant actor
The fact that they are only 10 years apart and played mother-daughter role is fantastic
Many people say focus on career some say on marrige but we all have karmic account and to fulfill that we can on this planet sometime inspite of knowing oll the plan for next day lockdown happens which we were never aware of ...if you will walk on path of spirituality you will realise there is reason behind everything nobody comes in someone’s life without purpose..you might get best of career but if  you are alone in it  no one to share it’s depressing..balance in life is important but life created by God we must accept success failure equally as given by creator ..all drama S for Society is all about ego big wedding big job titles oll for status and if you ever ask that person is he okay with all the fame and success he will say he feel empty when soul is disconnected from source how one be whole also the way body need food same way soul needs God connection..human try alott but it’s God who is creating everything don’t interfere in his work wt is meant to will come on right time and he will help you if you will stay I. Touch with avid in regular basis
If you&#39;re financially left at the mercy of your husband, you&#39;re no different from a slave. Of course, this is not true in all instances - many working husbands treat their caring homemaker wives with respect and affection, considering them the pillar behind their success. <br><br>But those who are toxic use their money to control you and blackmail you; they have you at their beck and call, just because they&#39;re the breadwinner. This even happens to husbands, but very rarely so in India due to the rarity of male homemakers. <br><br>Housewives/husbands, make sure you have your own source of income under all circumstances - whether it&#39;s a job, royalty or property. You should be ready for anything life throws at you and not let anyone own you.
I mean really...🧐 my mum always says ki agr hubby job chhodne ko kaha toh hubby ko chhod dena but job nhi
Randi madrchod ,, har land ki diwani ,, fir chai ghoda ka bhi samil isme land land ,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂 abhi iske fak ke marunga land, randi sali priyanka ke hol me ghoda ka land ,😵😵😵😵😵😵😂😂😂😂
You people are runing our indian culture
In our society, parents are always right. Very few parents can listen to their children and let them do whatever they want to, and support their decision.
How the heck is Shefali Shah the mom of Priyanka Chopra? She looks like her sister or friend! There&#39;s something seriously wrong with Bollywood movies 🙄
One more mentality is.....daughter should study and build career. Daughter in law should stay at home and cook. No one talks about that
I think both genders have complete rights to live in marriage to step out from marriage...some women’s are tend to be in d marriage no matter what,just for being with husband d women’s alleged their husbands in false cases like dv etc..so all genders should be consider same in our society ...
Very true..especially girls cant live according to themselves always they r judge... Kaun is baat ko sahi samaj te hai
If they don&#39;t want a wife to look over her career and look over only home then why don&#39;t they marry a completely uneducated girl? The answer is that they want to show off in society that their status is so high that they are marrying an equally educated girl like them. But after marriage they don&#39;t want that girl to be equally successful like them because of the fear of inferiority complex.
Achi film hai. Kaafi baatein hein samajhne layak.

Atleast desi maa baap support their children forever......not like western culture where they leave their children like any other animal after some time....be proud of indian culture where we are taught to face the problems and solve it rather than running way..........I am not saying that we should tolerate violence and other things....but we should make efforts to sustain relationships as much as possible.......live like a man ,,,,,,,,,multiple partners to animals ki fitrat hoti hai.....

I have seen both the cases in my family.. One carried on with her inspite of all the negativity and another one came out of it.. Hard to  say, who is right or who is wrong.. Recent film Thappad is the best example..

How ... Hum kese ek dusre ki dushman h independent hone k bajaye ap ye bol rahe ho k well seat h kisi chiz ki koi kami nhi hogi... Ye word me bhi roj sunti thak gayi hu yr stop it.
Hmari situation thodi alag h.....😐☺☺
Career impt h
Sometimes I just feel that we really need to teach some of our parents that self love isn&#39;t selfishness, coz if they known that maybe some of them wouldn&#39;t be in marriages for children or anything else, because then they teach their own kids the same thing😑It&#39;s just sad to see a mother pushing her daughter in unhappy marriage coz this is happen in real life and eve happening right now in some families😶

Looking closely..they do resemble each other :-) Mum and daughter.
Definitely but misunderstandings create karna n faltu cheezon ke beeche kuch na karna race se zyada bada gunah hai
I very much agree with this
True
The most sufferable person after divorce are the children. Its easy to get divorce and move on but what about child. Its nightmare for children. You can&#39;t keep them engaging with toys..they need mother father both. I don&#39;t believe cheating should be neglected but things need to sought out because divorce is like walking way from the problem. Its the most easiest way indeed.
Is movie me priyanka divorce ki bat kr rhi h aur barsat movie me bolti h ki divorce hindi me ny hota talak to urdu word h

Parents want to marry their educated and independent daughters with a rich man, who earns hefty, doesn&#39;t matter if he earned that position by licking his senior&#39;s dick, whether he&#39;s educated or not and whether he is a wolf dying to fuck all the women of this world.  All that matters is MONEY and LOG KYA KAHENGE. And if you complain the answer you get is &quot;Shadi k baad sab thik ho jata hain&quot;.
Shefali shah.... omg I just love her. She is so damn talented. She really looks like a frustrated wife and mother
Justa branding of western culture.

i truly agree with her mother no matters how many of u criticise me ....... women are the strength and bond of the family ...... i am not against their career orientation but their responsbility of family shoulf be priority ..... and &quot;divorce&quot; is the very last iption when things get really offensive otherwise relationships have ups and downs divorxe is not the option everytime
Excellent
Basically they want educated women who don’t think for themselves and remain obedient. Like literally they don’t see anything wrong with that logic.
Mall se shadi lol
But no one will talk about that these are two stinking rich people talking.  They are usually self absorbed and only think in terms of &#39;their own happiness&#39; as if it is a constant thing.  Happiness goes up and down.  Always.
Beti maa ke divorce hone ka intajar kar rahi hai ki baad mai maa ke sath rahe , lekin wo ye nahi deakh paa rahi hai ki uski maa Kush hai lekin uski beti agar Kush nahi hai to wo maa ko chore kar alag reh Sakti hai jaise chahe ,lekin wo maa ko hi galat bole rahi hai , Jawan larki ko bina maa ya baap Bhai ya behan ke bina apna jivan jine nahi aata .to maa ko pareshan karti hai.akele jikar dikhaye to jaane.
