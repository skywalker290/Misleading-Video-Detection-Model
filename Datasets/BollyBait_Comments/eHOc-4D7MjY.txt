December 2018.....4 years...
Full movie in just 3 minutes. wow.
Priyanka just awesome
How many of you think that Bajirao Mastani is a better film than Padmaavat
nice
nice
nice
Dipika douloge is osm
Is movie se accha to peshwa bajirao  serial h. Aur ranveer se acchi acting ki h karan suchuk ne.
In the end Ranveer is the biggest winner is not Deepika  and not Priyanka only Ranveer singh. You stole the show .He is the best
Ranveer 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I swear it&#39;s one of the best movie I have ever seen... I said best 💕💕💕
This movie was a masterpiece !! I wish if shreemant could&#39;ve survived , he would have countered the britishers successfully . But it also shows how lethal can family turbulence be , that such a fine man lost his life to it .
Will always be my one of the most favourite,movie,no matter what ,1st ,2nd,or side ,To me,Mastani is the One &amp; ONLY the Best ,last&amp;Forever For Bajirao........yes,it is,,,,,,,,,,,,and my favourite is Hamari Dil ek saath dharakti aur rukhti bhi hai.........na!!!!!!!!hmmmmm
Still coming in 2018 to enjoy this masterpiece trailer ??
Please upload full movie bajiro mastani
Soy peruana y me encantó por completo
Deepika is best
Shahrukh hota to bhot maza ata

After watching padhmavati, i am big fan of ranvir Singh, acting Ka baap hei
This movie is not just a fictional drama of 2.5 hrs but it&#39;s a message for those cruel people...who just seperate people accn to cast, relegion that &quot;every religion tells us to love...but love has no releigon&quot;😘😘!!
Still m watching this
Wow

Okay Bajirao Mastani, sure. Great love story. I&#39;m expecting a bonus movie or sequel called: Bajirao Mastani: Kashi ki Kahani
no more Salman?
What about this film?
Great bajirao
the couple I like most in Bollywood &lt;3
Super movie
1.47
Best movie in the world and alot better than padmavat,padmavati is shit infront of bajiaraomastani
Watching @june2k18. Still goosbmps
Priyanka 👌👌👌👌
Overly dramatic jodha akbar is better
I understand Priyanka&#39;s emotions!!!
Priyanka Chopra Just stole the show from deepika and ranveer .. <br>Priyanka Chopra Is the Only actress who played the role of Sister In Dil Dharakne Do , A Lover In Gunday And A Wife In Bajirao Mastani opposite Ranveer Singh .
o filme parece ser muito bom pena que não é dublado e nem tem legenda em português
My all time fav.... if someone asks Ramleela or BajiraoMastani or Padnavaat..... i will say there is no compitition with BajiraoMastani... no.1..... i want another epic from Bhansali sir with these three super  combination RanveerDeepika and Priyanka......
Hum Peshwa hai hi aise.... The only Warrior who won 40 battles non stop and never faced defeat was Bajirao Ballal Bhatt.. He looted all the mughal territories.. And defeated the British
this is a copy of padmaavat
The man who never lost a battle but to love.

बाजीराव पेशवे असे नव्हते, ज्या रीतीने दाखवलं आहे
Superrrrrrr
Priyanka outperformed the other main lead actors.
In German the great movie is called &quot;an immortal love&quot;.<br>Colorful, emotional, breathtaking and powerful movie, I love it ❤<br>Greetings from Germany
I&#39;m just a simple black girl  who loves her some indian muisc and I literally learned the chorus of every song in there very well 😂 that&#39;s how you know good music is good music when you don&#39;t give a fuck . I have no shame in my heart.
my all time favorite❤️❤️❤️
&quot;Ap humse hamari zindagi mang lete hum apko khushi khushi de dete magar apne tou humse hamara ghuroor cheen liya&quot; WTF!! <br>Yrrr zabardast acting ha... still watching!
Team deepika.....And deepika u just nailed it....I mean mastani ....Wow....Best performance....
Pride of brahmins..
i want a film on the story of alaudin khalji ilove him he can be winner
Ranvirs acting was killing.... Hats off to ranvir sing
Awesome movie
Rajput Vs ishq dialogue copy
Two queeeeens in one movie should be fkkkknnnn suppper hit n it&#39;s looook woooooooow that movie
Watching it again in 2018 for deepika...😍😍😍
Can anybody tell me the name of the song starting from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHOc-4D7MjY&amp;t=150">2:30</a>?
Who is come after watching padmaavat trailer
The second installment of a trilogy is often the best. Although this one is an unofficial trilogy, Bajirao is better than Ram-Leela and am sure Padmavati won&#39;t be as good as Bajirao
Vai ter dublado ???
Wow the🚩 great Maratha warrior🚩
Quisiera saber cómo puedo ver la película Bajirao Mastani
Better than 300
Who&#39;s watching this masterpiece trailer in 2018?
gnta jaisa
bajiro mastani should do in Marathi also
Does anybody else notice the Elia-Rhaegar-Lyanna parallels? <br>No? Just me? <br>Okay then.
It has been 2 years of the film.but still this film remain in my heart forever
One of the finest movies in the indian movie industry. It has got very powerful dialogues and the actors have presented them at their best which made this movie a huge success.
I loved this movie
Bajirao Ne Mastani Se Mohabbat Ki Hai aiyashi Nahi.

no Khan can even play this role as ranveer played it
the most innocent of them all is Kaashi. Mastani should have back out as soon as she got to know that Bajirao is married. Stealing other&#39;s spouse is more than a crime for me.
After padmavati
❤️❤️❤️
Ranveer,, best in the world
Ranveer&#39;s acting was not at all good....his acting was not acting....
Nice.........<br>....
Damm❤❤❤❤
Where can I watch the full movie with English subtitles

Watched it last night.  Love it!
Epic!!!
Ranveer is best..
Hinduism in India is been saved by this 2 gods... &quot; Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj &amp; Peshwa Bajirao Ballad&quot;.
Priyanka ❤❤❤
Har har Mahadev....<br>Ranveer Singh.....<br>Looking....<br>Kadakkkkkkkkkkkk.........
marathas history is great .,
Extensive use of Urdu they would&#39;ve used Marathi/Hindi cuz it&#39;s the Marathas urdu should&#39;ve been used for Mastani&#39;s dialogues<br>Btw Urdu is one of my favourite languages i just wanna say that Urdu doesn&#39;t go here
Watching this after padmavati trailor😂
Came here after watching Padmavati trailer, to compare. :P<br>Well this trailer is longer, and with more dialogues. But this didnt have the &quot;goosebumps effect&quot; neither the haunting soundtrack of Padmavati. Waiting eagerly for 1st Dec &#39;17 now :D
Jodhaa akbar was better than this
अपनी धरती अपना राज🚩
After watching Padmavati trailer who came here for comparison?
October 2017 anyone??
whose here after watching Padmavati&#39;s trailer?
Hit like if you came here again after watching Padmavati&#39;s trailer
A Hindu Warrior who never Lost any battle. A man who revived Hindus era in India from North TN upto J&amp;K . Maratha Kingdom reached it&#39;s zenith during his leadership. These are the reasons why Porkistan banned this film .
deepika is just an gravitified grounded personality..nothing can just influence her..she is unbreakable..loved her in this movie..
A True master of Art
Brahmin rootha to Raavan
Best Trailer Ever... Can watch it for infinite times.
Who is here after watching Padmavati trailer ??

Hit like of you have come after Padmavathi First look
I don&#39;t understand why most film makers promotes and glorifies cheating/unfaithfulness in cinema. It is wrong to be unfaithful to your husband or wife. This is exactly what this movie does. This only my observation

Wow, first Indian movie trailer I see that doesn&#39;t seem ridiculously over-the-top and cheesy. Gonna give this a shot!
one of my favorite  movie trailer
Priyanka was underused in the movie but still she was the best
🕉हर हर महादेव🕉, जय हो 🙏🚩
how to download this movie <br>plzzz help me
Wow
Best dailuge prinka
har har mahadev was the highlight.

priyanka diloauge ap humse hamari zindage mang lete lkn ap humse humara gurrur chin liya
i love deepika she is most beautiful
Actually Ranver and Deepika lived a true love story in this film
very emotional movei i am priyanshi
yes
It&#39;s so funny to see filmmakers put women with their long hair let loose into the battlefield. No, no, guys! Any woman in her right mind would hide her hair under the helmet or at least make it into a braid. Long hair let loose does not only make fighting basically impossible because it will fly into your eyes, it will got entangled into your armour, especially haulberk which the lady is wearing here. Battlefield is a place to survive, not to look pretty ;)
deepika the warrior beauty..priyanka the gracious queen
blockbuster......shandar..zabardast ...zindabad
blockbuster........
MAST
epiiccc...<br>this is just excellent....<br>can&#39;t wait for the movie to come out....

Omg! I must see this!!
wow
Super..  :) Keep going Sanjay Leela Bansali Sir :) <br>your work always inspired me :)
i m damn sure that &#39;BAJIRAO MASTANI&#39; is really better than DILWALE...
The background score is such an important aspect of period movies and what we hear in this trailer is just EPIC.
simply surreal...awesome potrayal of baj rao...a military ingenious valiant indian emperor and ranveer casting as him is not a coincidence...he has got the perks of being a emperor...and his acting from the trailer just proves that and fr both actress needless to say they were awesome...just waiting fr its release..
Harr harr MAHADEV ! Jai BAJIRAO PESHWA !

Wowww, spectacular trailer.
omg this is the best trailer in 2015...ppl r watching dilwale trailer but actually dis deserves more!!!...These days directors are only focusing on masala and all dat but no one focuses on history....dis is like knowing the history of india wid entertainment....wonderful job!!!
Man...That trailer Looks Damn Awsome....I am stunned!What a look....Deepika,Priyanka,Ranveer....Crazy Stuff...cant wait to see..:)
Ranveer Singh is convincing as Bajirao, the way he looks, his mannerism and the way he speaks. While Deepika looks stunning as Mastani, somehow her dialogue and expression don&#39;t hit the right notes.
wow
deepika is very nice and talanted also ranveer I think they will rock the theaters on 18 dec for sure
waiting !!!!!!
i m sure its better then dilwale on content... BM&gt;&gt;Dilwale
again... ramleela type claasic movie... ranveer singh rocks... with bhansali... wowwwwww
and at last the trailer with the best dialogues ever ..#MostAwaited
Movie teaser was cool but dil nhi khush hua yaaar
NICE ,SANJAY LEELA BHANSALI FILMS ALWAYS PAISA VASUL FILM
bajirao a veer brahmin king.....great warrior
The trailer looks promising and visually stunning.. I am just not getting what this film is whole about.. I think there is too much going on.. there&#39;s war(yudh) love triangle( i.e what I think between ranveer dp and PC) just not getting what this movie is all about.. An answer would be appreciated :)
i can&#39;t wait to see priyanka performing in this perfect row i can see it already that she do it great can&#39;t wait
wow 😍
day by day Priyanka&#39;s acting is becoming very similar to Srk&#39;s acting
Magnetic 💓 Stunning 💖 Exquisite 💘 Majestic 😍 Classy 💝 <br>Bajirao ❤<br>Mastani 💞<br>Kashibai 💕
How does Priyanka juggle between her Hollywood acting career and bollywood acting career?? Can&#39;t believe she is the same actress as Alex in Quantico. Just amazing!
three of them looks awesome.... waiting for the movie.... this is epic... will be one of the best movies ever.... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23priyanka">#priyanka</a> so graceful... stole the movie... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deepika">#deepika</a> really bold... looks gr8 dp.... and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ranveer">#Ranveer</a>.... bajirao will be one of ur best characters ever... fantastic role...  &amp; the dialogues ... touching , mind blowing.... hats off to BM trailer
this film minus the romantic melodrama..could be bollywoods answer to films like 300... EPIC HERO,... EPIC BATTLE.THE TRUE INDIAN HERO. SAD... its not going to be... wish we can see a epic battle film on heroes like rana pratap sivaji and alike...
super epic by sanjayy sirr excellent action by ranverr super acting by depika and prinykaa hope her the bestt resultt
Bahubali + Devdas = BM ~ Pure Awesomeness
love u priyanka
block buster..its definitely going to beat dilwale..pryanka,deepika and ranvir all are my favorites
har har mahadev!!!!!!!!!!
Ek Number
really mesmrizing but the mukut ranveer wears is bit too loose

After such a long time, seeing something really good in Bollywood. This will be one movie which I will watch without waiting for reviews :D. Dilwale looks garbage in front of this. SLB work shows in trailer, will be magnificent in theaters. Hope Maharashtra Govt makes this movie tax free. Feels good to see the real warriors of India.
Best film of 2015
PC is phenomenal
Youtube is so drunk. same video comes as ad.  LOL....
hmm will receive good critical response maybe
I can&#39;t wait
This is how the trailer must be made...fabulous work...I was a Rohit shetty movie fan but once someone sees this trailer he cannot resist himself from watching this epic BAJIRAO MASTANI

!!!! रणपंडीत बाजीराव !!!!<br>वयाच्या अवघ्या २० व्या वर्षी स्वराज्याचा पेशवा झालेला हो! अवघं चाळीसच वर्षांचं शापित आयुष्य आणि त्यातही केवळ वीसच वर्षांची कारकीर्द लाभलेला हा अचाट योद्धा! त्या वीसच वर्षांच्या काळात त्याने हिंदवी स्वराज्याचं हिंदवी साम्राज्य केलं! जो संकल्प थोरल्या महाराजांनी मनी धरला होता, या रणधीराने तो पूर्तीस नेला. महाराष्ट्रास वाकुल्या दाखवत ४०० वर्षे खिजवणारी दिल्ली जाळली, लुटली आणि फस्तच नव्हे, तर अंकित केली ती याच बाजीरावाने ! कर्तबगार पेशव्याची आज जयंती. यानिमित्ताने आज हा मस्तानीपल्याडचा बाजीराव आठवूया. अभिमानाने फुलून जाऊया!!!!<br>आपल्याला एखाद्या थोराच्या वैयक्तिक आयुष्यात इतका काही वेड्यागत रस असतो की, बाजीराव म्हटल्यावर आठवते ती फक्त मस्तानी. या मस्तानीचं गारुड एवढं काही गडद आहे की, त्यापलीकडचा बाजीराव आम्हाला नुसता ऐकूनही ठाऊक नसतो. वास्तविक बाजीराव हा शतकानुशतकांतून कधीतरीच उदित होणारा निष्णात सेनापती, साक्षात रणपंडित!! ४० वर्षांचं आयुष्य, २० वर्षांची कारकीर्द आणि ४१ लढाया; करा कल्पना!! या ४१ लढायांपैकी एकसुद्धा लढाई न हरलेला नरपुंगव होता बाजीराव!! ४१ वेळा अजिंक्य राहिलेल्या आणि तेही आपल्या शिवप्रभूंच्या हिंदवी स्वराज्यासाठी युद्ध करत अजिंक्य राहिलेल्या महारथीचा आपल्याला किती अभिमान वाटला पाहिजे! पण आम्ही करंटे मात्र बाजीरावाला प्रेमवीर म्हणून रंगवतो… नाहीतर मग त्याची जात पाहतो! वस्तुत: महापुरुषांची ‘जात’ नसते पाहायची, तर त्यांनी जनसामान्यांच्या मनामनात पेटवलेली अभिमानाची ‘वात’ आणि त्यायोगे सबंध समाजाने टाकलेली ‘कात’ पाहायची असते. हे आपण जेव्हा शिकू तेव्हाच इतिहास नावाचा खजिना आपल्या खर्‍या स्वरूपात खुला होतो. उदाहरणार्थ – ब्रिटिश फिल्डमार्शल Bernard Montgomery याने आपल्या History of Warfare ग्रंथात बाजीरावाने लढलेल्या पालखेडच्या युद्धाचं वर्णन ‘A masterpiece of strategic mobility’ या गौरवपूर्ण शब्दांत केलंय! मुळात दख्खनचा प्रांतपाल म्हणून आलेल्या आणि नंतर स्वत:चीच असफजाही राजवट सुरू केलेल्या निजामाने मराठ्यांच्या कोल्हापूर आणि सातारा गाद्यांमधील दुफळीचा फायदा घेत १७१९ चा सय्यद बंधूंशी झालेला मराठ्यांचा करार मानायला नकार दिला. वर शहाणा कोल्हापूरचे संभाजी आणि सातारचे शाहू दोघांनाही म्हणू लागला ‘‘तुमच्यातला खरा छत्रपती कोण ते मी ठरवून देतो आणि त्यालाच कराराप्रमाणे चौथाई-सरदेशमुखी घेता येईल.’’ पंतप्रतिनिधींच्या कारस्थानामुळे कोल्हापूरचे संभाजी निजामाला सामील झालेले. महाराष्ट्राला लागलेला दुहीचा शाप, दुसरे काय! पण शाहूंनी मात्र या अपमानास्पद गोष्टींना थारा द्यायचा नाही असं ठरवलं आणि त्यावेळी कर्नाटकच्या मोहिमेवर असलेल्या बाजीरावांना पाचारण केलं. या काळात निजाम स्वत: ऐवजखानासोबत पुणे जिल्ह्यात धुमाकूळ घालत होता, त्याचा सरदार तुर्कताजखान नाशिक व संगमनेर भागात धुडगूस घालत होता आणि रंभाजी निंबाळकर सातार्‍यावर बरसत होता. स्वराज्यावर असं चहूबाजूंनी संकट आलेलं असताना राऊंनी एक अनोखाच निर्णय घेतला. १७२७ च्या दसर्‍याला त्यांनी जे सीमोल्लंघन केलं ते विद्युतवेगाने थेट औरंगाबादच्या दिशेने आणि काही समजायच्या आतच गोदावरीपल्याडच्या निजामी प्रांताचा पार चुथडा करून टाकला. गडबडून गेलेला निजाम सारे सोडून बाजीरावांच्या मागे! बाजीराव मात्र वायुवेगाने हालचाली करत संचार करत होते. वाटेत लागणारा निजामाचा सर्व मुलूख फस्त करत होते. बाजीरावांचा रोख पाहून निजामाला वाटले की, ते बुर्‍हाणपूरवर हल्ला करणार. येडा सगळी तयारी करून बसला, तर बाजीराव त्याला वाईट चकवा देत पार भरूचला उगवले!! वर अफवा पसरवून दिल्या की, निजामशी हातमिळवणी करून मी गुजरातवर आक्रमण करतोय. निजामाशी उभा दावा असलेला अलिमोहनचा सुभेदार सरबुलंदखान हबकला, तर बाजीरावांनी त्याला अभय दिल्याचे नाटक केले. कशात काही नसताना निजाम हकनाक बदनाम झाला. तळतळून त्याने पुणे प्रांत बेचिराख करून टाकला. संभाजींना छत्रपती घोषित केले. हेतू केवळ एकच की, बाजीराव खुल्या मैदानात यावेत. कारण निजामाचा सगळा भर तोफखान्यावर. त्याच्या वेगाला मर्यादा. बाजीराव सडे स्वारी करणारे, मिळेल ती चटणी-भाकर खाणारे आणि परमुलूख लुटून रसद मिळवणारे. त्यामुळे त्यांच्या हालचाली जलद! ते कशाला निजामाला भीक घालताहेत? उलट निजाम पुण्यावर आहे म्हटल्यावर बाजीराव थेट औरंगाबादच्या दिशेने निघाले. पन्नाशी उलटलेला पाताळयंत्री निजाम दुसर्‍यांदा अवघ्या पंचविशीतल्या राऊस्वामींच्या डावाला बळी पडला! आपला सारा तोफखाना मागे नगरलाच ठेवण्याशिवाय त्याला गत्यंतरच उरले नाही. तसाच औरंगाबादच्या दिशेने धावला! नियती खळखळून हसली असेल त्यावेळी!! २५ फेब्रुवारी १७२८. अतिप्रचंड सैन्य घेऊन आलेल्या निजामाने अवघ्या पंचवीस सहस्र सैन्यासोबत लढणार्‍या पंचविशीतल्या तरुण पोरासमोर बिनशर्त शरणागती पत्करली. बाजीरावांनी मेहेरबानी करून अत्यंत अपमानास्पद अवस्थेत जायला वाट करून दिली त्याला. पुढे ६ मार्चला मुंगी-पैठणच्या शमानुसार त्याला मराठ्यांची चौथाई-सरदेशमुखी तर परत द्यावीच लागली, शिवाय मान तुकवून शाहूंनाच छत्रपती म्हणून स्वीकारावे लागले!! चातुर्याने हालचाली केल्या तर आपले कमीतकमी नुकसान करून रणमैदानात काय काय चमत्कार करून दाखवता येतात याचे उत्तम उदाहरण म्हणजे ही पालखेडची न झालेली लढाई!! शिवरायांच्या युद्धनीतीचा विकास या हालचालींमध्ये दिसून येतो. बाजीरावांनी या युद्धाचे ठिकाणही स्वत:च ठरवले, वेळही स्वत:च ठरवली आणि कावेबाज म्हणून समजल्या गेलेला निजामाला आपल्या तालावर अक्षरश: हवे तसे नाचवले! याच मोहिमेने बाजीरावांचा आणि मराठेशाहीचा डंका सर्वत्र वाजण्यास सुरुवात झाली. <br>लेखक ---- ऍड. विक्रम श्रीराम एडके<br>!!!! बाजीराव पेशव्यांना मानाचा मुजरा !!!!<br>भन्साळीला प्रमोट करण्याऐवजी हे प्रमोट करू. प्रबोधन तरी होईल!

only a brainless stupid person would prefer DILWALE over this epic CINEMATIC experience .... SLB is pure class <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23epic">#EPIC</a>
ranveer u rock.. har har mahadev. .. far better than diwale..... ab srk ka zamana gaya
This is amazing kashibai Kashibai Kashibai I know m going to fall in love with the character Altogether the three actors have emerged beautifully MUST WATCH 
Har  har  Mahadev.....Best Film Ever..
Wow 😍
This trailer looks absolutely enthralling . A fine tribute to Peshwa Baji Rao I who was one of the greatest heroes of India who not only brought about the fall of Mughal Power in India but on it&#39;s ruins laid the foundation of the Mighty Maratha Empire . He fought 41 battles in his career in which he lost none . His command of cavalry was so brilliant that Gen. Montgomery of Great Britain of the World War II fame mentions Peshwa Baji Rao&#39;s victory at Battle of Palkhed as an act of Military Genius . I would have loved to call him the Napoleon of India but since Napoleon came after Baji Rao, I would call Napoleon as the Baji Rao of France . The incredible speed with which he built an empire in the medieval times can only be matched by Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab .
Only ranbeer is will suited, not the other two lead actresses
Har Har Har Mahadev
Deepika never fails to amaze me with her acting . One word Stupendous 👀
Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a magician! His direction and his creativity is amazing !
Yes..Yes...Yes...Now that&#39;s called a theatrical...! Indian Cinema at its best Period...! Now audiences can&#39;t tolerate the only Masala&#39;s anymore...! Go Ranveer...Dp...&amp; Pc...and obviously Sanjay Sir also...&amp;Congrats the whole team of Bajirao Mastani...!
Pc stole the show mind blow........!!! RS roxxx
