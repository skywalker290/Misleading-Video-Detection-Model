The last scene was the best proposal of the universe. 😂😂
Boss, you are making too many of  these crappy videos. I don&#39;t know your intentions are pure or not. You criticize bad scenes but you show them.
last one was so hilarious , tainu pyar krna payega , bas thapddon kee kami hai
Last scene wtf😭
The last scene... I was literally falling down laughing 🤣🤣🤣
That Tajeshvini movie has a very bad ending where they married the girl to her rapist and shows this an progressive ending and celebrated it. Why do these bollywood people think that marrying your rapist is such an good idea and somehow it will justify the rapist as some saint.
Slap though 👋😂😂😂😂
Awesome  bro 😂😍<br>U have opened people&#39;s eyes, specifically who love these kind of bollywood scene<br><br>I appreciate ur every content. Keep it up
So kissing AJ without his consent... rather with his unquestionable refusal, was ok. But what&#39;s not ok is him slapping her for that? Wow.
Ohh
The last scene was too bizzare
Can you make a video on telugu movie SUNDARI please. It&#39;s just so absurd
Got headache after listening to him for 5 minutes. 🤯
Purani filme Chan ke dekho content hi content hoga aur south ki commercial movies bhi dekhna
Kabir singh shayad yahin(across the border) se inspire hua tha.. Ek doosre ko jhapad maar do tho pyar ho jayega 🤦🤦🤦🤦
Meenakshi looked like she was trying to do Kung Fu...
The last one😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=122">2:02</a> bro i think you never heard of BDSM
WTF just happened throughout the whole video.....
The last one was seriously hilarious 😂😂😂..  thanks Jammy you really affirm my belief that people who recognize true and good content do exist in India.. btw thanks you made me laugh really hard🤣😂😂👍
Can u make a review of shaurya aur anokhi ki kahani... Plzz
Tried and refused productions👍
Bollywood 90s is one of the sole reason for some people&#39;s bizarred mindsets
Le man: Icchadhari nagin<br>Jammy: Evil shape-shifting snakes<br>😂😂
Last one tho 😂<br>Mtlb kuch bhi😂😂
They can make another Kabir Singh movie on the last slap scene.
wtf was that last one LMFAO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=100">1:40</a> so slapping is wrong and all, but it is kind of weird how it is overshadowing the fact that the girl sexually harassed the guy.
Prabhudeva is so overrated... chi
the last one is super hit hahaha
Why don&#39;t you review ram teri ganga maili
I&#39;m here for some vocabulary and English lessons😂😂 you have an amazing hold on language.
Well... Nothing wrong with this Action Jackson slap scene... Just reverse the genders and you&#39;ll know
Watch before I wake 😭
Appreciation from across the boarder..
Hey bhagwan...the last one was toh mashaallah!!
You should also watch Nani telugu movie of maheshbabu
The last one bruhh what the fuck is that 😭😂
It&#39;s so nice to finally have a Man speak against these Traumatising Moments in Bollywood Movies<br>How easily it was being Normalised and acted out, to be consumed in the name of &#39;Entertainment&#39;<br>It was not only deeply offensive, but for myself as a girl child, it was MORTIFYING! OBSCENE! SHOCKING! PAINFUL! To say the least <br>Not covering the long-lasting unconscious side effects of such depiction in the name of Cinema on our Societal Conditioning
Hats off for his hardwork in making videos 👏💜
Hahahaha...  😂 <br>The last scene was completely crazy... Tenu pyar karna pyega.. Slap..
What we see as bizzaed jammy see it as content 😂😂why in the world is it than so hilarious in this way I won&#39;t watch any of this outside this channel 😂and here I am watch this and getting entertained what the hells wrong with me.I guess this  is not entertaining unless someone points it out 😅that concludes how humans work, any way keep up the good work
You speak like Fittuber ❤️
Tried&amp;Refused after this series Triggered&amp;Refused 🤣🤣
I am a little confused about Anupam Kher. Is he not allowed to play a negative role or was it not a negative role. I agree it is not much of a well written character but still your point is the movie portrayed a bad action in a good light. I just don&#39;t see it. Also the rape scene by the pool. Unimpressive and lacking any acting. But a rape scene is a bad action in poor light.
Sahib Jee was hilarious. I forgot all the world&#39;s worries, the global warming,  hunger and depraved capitalism as i watched the heroine mouth those potent lines in Punjabi &quot;Tainu pyaar karna hee paienga! &quot; And then she slaps the guy!  I wanna watch this whole movie 😀
Where the hell was sensor board when it needed most?
Love me: NO NO NO<br><br>*SLAP EACH OTHER *<br><br>BOTH ARE IN LOVE
J
do the opposite of action jackson scene , i&#39;ll also slap the girl who&#39;ll kiss me when i am denying , slapping a person who is molesting you physically is not wrong doesn&#39;t matter if its a girl or a boy
Binging ! This dude has best content and the perfect voice, humour to go with it.
Wait<br>So you shouldn&#39;t slap a girl if is forcing you<br>What if thats done by a girl everyone would be applauding her and you would be like &quot;this is what indian cinema wants&quot;<br>Where is the gender equality you.......
I laughed out so hard in the sahib jee scene lol😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The last part i- WTAF.
The Tejaswini scene disturbed me to the core.
first scene is because she didn’t ask for consent and i feel a girl or even a guy can slap the opposite gender if they don’t ask for consent
From across the border❤️<br>Tenu pyar karna paye ga💓😂😂😍
Show your face
So many crimes because of Indian Cinema
The last movie slap scene was like Ram Leela movie only the difference is they used gun and bullet and these two used their hands🤣😂
That last scene was epic... 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
A time where Hollywood was making &quot;The Godfather&quot; and Bollywood was making shits like this
The rape scene is really so bizarre 😡😡😡
quick question, you are trying to be the watchmojo for hindi films arent you? :)
Wah bhai wah , agar koi male female ki jabardasti kiss karne ki koshish kare to Females chaanta marenge lekin male kare to problem ? Us scene se pehle Ajay Devgan ko pool me gira diya tha usne. <br>By the way AJ was a bad movie , I am not sexist Just exposing the hypocrisy
I want you ask you one thing women knowing that men and women around her are creap still wears clothes which are not supported in that society is that good girl sign . Please change your feminist mindset . Or write I will only write for women who can do whatever when she wants full fill her greed&#39;s
Last one is the best one!!! 😂
The last scene is interesting next time my husband fights I will slap him and RUN away lol
I like the way you portray the videos and the way you talk... 👍👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=165">2:45</a> well done 😂😂😂😂😂
Hey I want the link of the Edm in this.
If you&#39;re making a video on misogynistic scenes,then please do one on the movie &#39;Laadla&#39; ,the whole movie is so regressive !<br>Even &#39;Beta&#39; ,gosh some Anik Kapoor movies were really regressive.
All idiots
Last one man😱.<br>I&#39;m spechless👋
i like how to narrate and yaa ur voice is too good
Last scene 😂😂
Do you have some positive videos too sir. I m curious to know in your voice
okay... so guy with the nive voice...I live across the border... and... that scene is actually too weird for me to understand... I mean... slapping and falling in love?😂😂😂 what the hell is going on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=328">5:28</a> i stopped watching zee cinema ...thank god i have found anime ....after that i didn&#39;t watch any any randi rona movie of bollywood
Tenu pyar karna  padega the background music  and their expressions 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Though from the last scene, we proudly can say that Indian and Pakistanis are not of much different minds ;)
I remember watching tejasvini and then thinking about this scene....it was horrifying to me as a kid and it is still
Last scene was OP000!😂😂😂😂
Anupam kher really did that movie .😑<br>Put a bullet in my head
WTF🤯🤯🤯🤯
Why do u call it as Indian movies? These are bollywood movies.Correct your title.
I&#39;m from Pakistan and i also HATE old Pakistani movies. So cringy 😬😬😬
The bonus one maybe I have watched something similar in an anime
i never why but the neck kissing in suraj hua maddham is way too weird with k2h2 music
The last slap scene 😂😂😂😂 this is a pakistani punjabi movie
The background music itself a masterpiece 😆😆😆😉
Wait! You are telling me that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=325">5:25</a> this wasn&#39;t censored but the just a normal kiss between two adults with  full consent is against our culture? Matlab kuch bhi
Jhand Bollywood of eighties and nineties.. And the actors from then have the audacity to judge the actors of today!... Like bhencho pehle apne pehle k kaam ko toh dekho kabhi!
Cross the border called Pakistan you can say that you won&#39;t turn in to stone
From where do you find these films???😳 Hats off to your patience that you can stand those!!!😱
This was a good video but don&#39;t understand why you did not mention Kabir Singh here and why you have always been Kabir Singh as just a character. I mean it happened in today&#39;s day and age.
I am watching your videos since 2018 and I really love your voice..
Last one was hilarious 😂😂😂
😂😂😂Maaaaaannnnnnn!!!<br>YOU have no idea what our Punjabi movies were like🙈🙈🙈🙈<br>Fan of yours! Much respect from Pakistan.
Man salute you for watching so many bizarre movies for us.
Gentleman, you look very young but your narrations are mature. Your voice is rather silky, pleasant on ears.... More power to you to cut  thru&#39; clutter of  mountain of content
I kinda feel bad for u that u have to watch all this cringy movies for us.started watching your videos a while ago..binge watching <a href="http://all.now/">all.now.</a>. good content
The slapping scene in the end, is like the cherry on top of a cake😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣<br><br>Truly a bonus scene to very informative and entertaining video 👍👍
Bollywood is Hinduphobic.<br>They show Hindus in the bad light.
Bonus overruled everything
Last one was............I have no words..........
Thumbs up for bonus scene
you missed Mithun Chakrabarti&#39;s movies. &quot;Gunda&quot; for example
Action Jackson is Ajay devgn version of Dabangg
Is it just me or are feminist guys really hot?
Whr&#39;d u get that....???? The last one ....no words ....🤪🤪🤪🤪
I so agree Tejasvini .. I have watched the movie and it was gross even then..
Last one is 🤣🤣shit man
I too agree Tejaswini was absolutely absurd
Bollywood... Hah hah ha.. n it&#39;s still same..
The last scene was an &quot;out of the universe&quot; level epic scene
Tejaswini😠😠😠
Wonder why he couldn’t say Pakistan? 😂
Ahahahahaha i am across that border 😂
Last one was epic😂😂
The bonus part 😄😄😄🤣🤣🤣
I literally love your voice💝
Tera pyar pyar pyar....thappad maar
Unpopular opinion....maybe: In AJ it&#39;s justifiable that he pushed her cuz well....she was irritating him and pulled him first I mean if the roles were switched then wouldn&#39;t the girl do the same..?
Last one is....😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=295">4:55</a> I was scared to the core, the moment I started watching this part.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=238">3:58</a> Nivedita Saraf 👍❤️
You missed &quot;phool aur kaante&quot; movie by Ajay devgan.  The entry of the heroine in that movie with song &quot;tujhe dekh mera dil dhadka&quot; is darn cringy.  Shitt Mann.  And they say today&#39;s movie are disturbing.  The way Ajay devgan literally molest the new girl..  And damn her clothes, so darn disgusting..  That whole song is another level crappy.
Hahahaha.. good content 👌👌😂😂
I really like the channel and how u speak against sexism and all...buy why quite few thumbnails always show women being abused or humiliated...
I love matlab kuch bhi
Hahaha 😂👌😂👌🤣 @ <a href="http://2.am/">2.am</a>
Timew have changed tho (not alone). From tejaswini to maaradaani
So ya, I am happy that I found this channel. This is the first time someone is showing my point on Bollywood on YouTube. You&#39;re great bro!!
Bc 6.30 pe jo hua bas kya hi kahu.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=379">6:19</a> that JUSTIFIES the statement of V S Reddy given to Anupama chopra
Tenu pyaar karna payegaa!! NAI 🤣
I dont watch this movie but i can say when he says tejasvini it makes me feel so good.....(becz its my real name)
I love your fricking voice (and your videos too)
I love your voice😁
Are hindi vull hoyegeho Kiya!??😤😤😤<br>Chilll bro ...hindi is good!
Hahahhahaha uff the last scene but the rape scene was truly disturbing
anjuman and ali ashgar..hope to slap my crush if the end result is same.hahha..waise u dislike word Pakistan sooo much that u keep mentioning us as across the border..ppl arent that bad across the borader 🙂🙂
I&#39;m still laughing at how you say &quot;a couple of shape shifting snakes&quot; like it&#39;s the most mundane thing in the world
Matlab kuch b??
I’m from Pakistan and seriously I laughed so much after watching the last scene..it was like a slap has jogged their memory that “love is a necessity “
Why does your voice seem different in this video ??
That&#39;s Nivedita Saraf, wife of  legendary Marathi actor Ashok Saraf in Ghar mein Ram Gali mein Shyam.
Haha the last one seems to be normal in today&#39;s world. Case in point, kabir singh
very funny,carry on !!!
I love the music that you use in starring of the video
Just downloaded this to show my friend..  tenu pyar krna padega 😋 thanks for video
I guess India and Pakistan must slap each other to fall in love eventually...
Ghar mein ram gali mein shyaam<br>Is the remake of the telugu movie <br>&quot; Intlo Ramayya veedhilo krishnayya&quot;
Oh lol.le gaya na pakistan bazi watch and enjoy.guy is ali ejaz actress is anjuman famous movie and a hit one👍
WTF happened to ajay devgan&#39;s film selection
You should (must) follow @babajogeshwari on Instagram
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=25">0:25</a> RIP Boromir/Ned Stark
Last one was unmatched thought of the writer. By the way one such movie missing on the list is Mela of Aamir and twinkle. It&#39;s literally crazy.
The last scene my friend... Actually explains the statement from Kabir Singh Director....
Fantastic video!
Saheb ji ....2 much 🤣🤣🤣
Meenakshi got Star Lord beat - The O.G Dance-Off Champ!
Even if u don&#39;t notify us,we would never watch this shit...😉
try seeing neney raju neney mantri of rana in telugu ...few scenes u get schoked ..how the charaters catherin and rana come close
Kuch bhi bolo yaar sahib jee ka romantic scene bara jabardast hai 😃😃😃ye to pura punjabi sherni ka style hai
That rape scene was very disturbing...
&quot;tenu pyar karna pega !! &quot;<br><br>&quot;nahi !!&quot;<br><br>✋✋<br><br>😢😢<br><br>✋✋<br><br>💏💏
Really gud....keep it up
7 minutes of my life wasted
omg... i am in luv with ur voice ... 😍😍
I think u should add some comic tune into your voice otherwise aapke list me sab bizzare hai. Hehe.
You know na that girl is urvashi dholakia in tejaswani
Last one is just the best😂😂
Ghar mein ram gali mein shaam is a remake of Telugu film
I just love that nagin sequence 😝😂🤣
सरहद पार वाला सीन देखने के बाद हँसते हँसते बुरा हाल हो गया।
Okay but, in Action Jackson, you are being a hypocrite. The girl was OBVIOUSLY touching/pursuing the guy without his consent. If a guy did the same to a girl n she slapped him, it would be all cool according to you I guess? No one should be hitting/slapping anyone; irrespective of the gender. Just pushing away or shoving is enough to get them away from you.
Last one was hilarious and tejaswani was really disturbing.
I think the last couple was into BDSM n didn&#39;t realise it up until that moment.
Brother do a video for some pseudofeminist movies
The Last One 🤣🤣🤣
Across the border scene was a precursor of Kabir Singh
Twinkle grabbing on to Ajay Devgan’s titties, in that picture.
Last one was a nightmare
I slapped a girl who proposed me n tried to seduce me
Well she also kissed him without his consent.
Mujhay tumhari video or us ka concepts pallay he nahi para k maqsad kya tha is video ka or jin scenes ko tum nay pick kia un main aisa kuch nazar nai aya agr inhe batoin ko dekho to bollywood ki har movie main har 10 main say aik scene main tatti ho jati hy
All the time as always vidio was bakwas but I watched it for english improvement
And the winner is across the border 😂😂😂😂
why your are saying bizzar scene on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=381">6:21</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=382">6:22</a> in movie sahab ji .infact we are proving the newtons law of motion that ever action has equal and opposit reaction.
Why Ajey Devgan is this much ridiculous....no acting sense at all.
Yaar you are hilarious wow what a review and last one (TAINU PYAR KARNA PADEGA) no words keep on doing such beautiful videos 👍
Tenu aurr video banana parega😋😉
Okay ... Huge Respect for watching all these pathetic scenes for us.🤘😭
The last seen was most cringing..
Tejaswini scene!!!wtf!!! ridiculous!
If the last slap gave smiles to lips of the leading pair, then that slap should have been given to the script writer(technically a wack) so as to knock some sense
Equivalents of last scene from across the border are available with our film industry as well...that too in plenty
Yeh jo bi bizzare videos hai Eske peche marthe the dekhne keliye 1990&#39;s mei. Ke kuch dekh hee le.
Slapping the girl was ok..she forcefully kissed ajay so why won&#39;t he slap... i would kill a guy if he tries to kiss me without my consent
Slapping the girl was ok..she forcefully kissed ajay so why won&#39;t he slap... i would kill a guy if he tries to kiss me without my consent
Hahaaaaaa i knew it was Pakistani movie.. it seemed familiar..ive been tortured enough
Hats off jammy and i pray to God that he gives you strength to handle such jaanleva nonsense and get beautiful logical contents for us......long live jammy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=114">1:54</a> I am not sure but she pulls him first, so she harrassed him and he just defended himself. I don&#39;t think self defense is wrong.
Awesome work bro honestly hilarious to watch....
Last movie scene was in one of Dharmendra&#39;s movie too<br>Exact same scene!!!!😂
Last movie scene was in one of Dharmendra&#39;s movie too<br>Exact same scene
She can kiss him without his permission, But he can&#39;t slap!<br>This is what I call height of hypocrisy... 😬
Hindi bolne me koi taklif he kya😀
Bhai edm btao konsa he pagal ho gya main dhoond dhoond ke
Bhai apki awaj sunkar lagta hai kartik aryan baat kar raha hai
Hi jammy Pls watch Telugu movie arundhati and provide your review  its a very good movie. Little bit old but very nice.
i am from pakistan<br>jani ap tek kha rahay ho <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=385">6:25</a> <br><br>by the way love you videos ♥
Dude, your videos tell me Bollywood always crossed the line with drugs, sexual abuse, murder and what not, we always deliver over the limit 😂 we don&#39;t know how to stay within boundaries..
Hahahahah across the border ya that&#39;s Pakistani movie.. Mostly were pathetic
Pls make something on reality show
EDM music on the nagin scene is hilarious!!!!!! sksksksksksksk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=320">5:20</a> similar sequences we had in 13 Reasons Why
Ugly stag entries 😂
Awesome video yaar❤️..  Bollywood mai aisi movies aana kab band hogi yaar?
You could something a&quot; Matlab kuch bhi&quot; episode.<br>&quot;Film or Song from Across the Border which  Bollywood has copied.&quot;
Last scene is awesome...but what they want to show by that jaw dropping scene
hindi movies par videos banato ho english mein bhai hindi nahi aati kya that will also leave us speechless
😂😂😂
That scene from Tejasvini was actually too much.
When you said &quot;content&quot; its sound like you were  Kunal Kamra &quot;kha milega itna content&quot;😂🤣🤣🤣
Toofan crossbow scene
Zakir Naik got his inspiration from Anupam Kher.. now we know.. quoting scriptures
Had it been a man who Forcibly kissed a woman, wouldn&#39;t the woman slap him? Ajay did nothing wrong in slapping his harraser
One doubt though...if a man forcibly kissed a woman who is loyal to her husband wouldnt she slap the man right away ?Why is it different fr a man in similar circumstances ?
I didn&#39;t get it tho.
The last scene is from a Pakistani movie not Bollywood iammy pants
The last scene- what?????????
YOUR MOM AND SIS R NOT SAFE AT HOME WITH YOU......ON SECOND THOUGHT EVEN YOUR FATHER AND RAMU KAKA.....AND ALSO THE PET DOG IF U HAVE 1
Omg... These scenes were hilarious
what material? didnt get the word.. no material tells its ok to molest women..
If some one kisses u against ur will...they deserve a slap.even if it was a woman.aagaya feminism ki bachcha
Aamir khan juhi chawla came in such a stoopid movie...a snake movie<br>The bonus scene was outstandinggggggggggghhgggg📧
One more bizarre movie saungadh akshay kumar starrer film
Fantastic vedio
😂😂😂 so true
That last scene, i think, was the inspiration for  sandeep vanga. 😂😂😂
Action Jackson scene was great comedy
Last one is hilarious (others as well )
Search for Mumbai ki Kiran bedi it&#39;s also an unintentionally funny movie
Hindi bol le gaandu
Totally stupidity has shown
That bonus scene is also available in one of Mithoon Chakravorty film
Abe sale hindi me bolll na
I literally request you to do a video on Kabir Singh! Seriously
I can suggest you south movie Hindi dubbed like  in which dragging horse under the trailer to catch  villain. A police officer firing pistol while sitting in his Jeep and next Jeep gets 100 feet jump due to recoil of pistol.
I like your way of explaining things or issue.👍👍👍
Last me 😂😂😂🤣🤣
You should make movies that made in Pakistan which is really tough to watch it gives you alot of content I am shoure
Hilarious
Bhai ur voice is attractive but sence of humour is 0% u should put some humour if u r  roasting anything. it feels like someone is reading a chapter in a class as per teachers wish...😅😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=314">5:14</a><br>This is unfuckingbelievable I-
Kabir Khan review
The scene from tejasvini ...<br>Omg.. don&#39;t get me started..<br>I was watching this movie with my family when in was in 6th standard...<br>I can&#39;t explain the awkward moment we had while watching this scene 😭😭😭😭
Last one was epic
With all due respect, I have to say something.<br>About the action jackson scene, I agree slapping a women is obscene and shouldn&#39;t have been portrayed the way it is.<br>But what if you reverse the situation, what if a guy was forcing himself on a women and the women slapped him? Would it be obscene as well? Would that be sexist as well? Wouldn&#39;t people appreciate it?
Last one was really hilarious.
😂😂😂😂😂
means you have waisted your entire life in watching such shit movies
Watch “kudrat”!!! It’s another cringe level also uploaded on YouTube
Have you ever watch nagin bani suhagan
Bhai Mithun pe banaa na please. Dance Dance, kasam paida karne....disco dancer...full of bad dancing and forced superstardom
Last slap😂😂😂😂😂😂😂omg ...... jake ab sidha thappad mardo kya propose karke time weast kar rahe????😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mujhe tumbnail main Larke ka blouse design bilkul pasand nahi Aya...aak thuuu🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ha ha ha ha ha
The first one isn&#39;t THAT inappropriate<br>Despite of him saying no, she pulls him close to her <br>And he didn&#39;t like that.<br>If the roles are reversed the girl will definitely slap the guy too in defense
Bonus scene was hilarious..... 😂
Tejaswani is so disturbing yar...
Be india be hindi
Gunda should have topped the list!!! The whole movie is filled with such scenes
Tejaswani was really bizarre scene
It sounds so similar to Kunal Kamra&#39;s voice.
Last one was hilarious 🤣
The last scene is what called a &quot;Slapstick Love.&quot;
Well,I haven&#39;t seen the Action Jackson bit in person,(just inferring from what ever scenes I saw in this video),that bit seems kinda reasonable...!!!......if a married or a loyal person in a relationship is kissed by someone else ,thier reaction would be similar......if a married woman or a woman in a commited relationships or even a single woman gets forcibly kissed by some other person who isn&#39;t thier partner,she wld slap the shit out of him...not only that ppl nearby wld surround dat guy and beat him to a pulp...and it wld soon be a national news...!!!..
What EDM music was that .. by the way??
This testing scene in an interview is purely Rajnikanth scene in Netrikann
Naache nsagin gali gali😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro next video do the best Ramsey movie😂😂😂😂
I have seen so many of your kuch bhi videos...i cant stop!seeing these videos makes me so happy knowing that there are people like you who actually understand that bollywood has been and continues to create some pathetic content that promotes no morals whatsoever....i would also like to recommend people to watch girlsfeed from buzzfeed.....again.... in love with your videos and i hope you keep creating content and keep inspiring girls like me to stand up for ourselves...ok this comment is getting way too long
Friend please bahubali ist per banao jis mein bahubali heroine ko molest karta hai aur ladki maan jati hai
Punjabis are like that minus slaps haha 😂 reminds me of my first love 19 years ago. Love from Pakistan
Tannu pyar krna payega 😂😂 was the best one
Voice is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kya bhai scenes toh dikha
The quality of your videos is dipping, buddy.
Anupam kher is not only reel life villain but real life villain also as he is the biggest andhbhakt of Modi and Bjp.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=27">0:27</a> that dog face.. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
What is the name of the edm song ?
Can you make a video of Indian movies that are worth watching... irrespective of any genre..
Oh man! The ending bonus was just fabulous.
Across the border one was the ultimate one
U r the best ..keep it up !!!
I love the way he explains every scene, and I love his voice. His voice is the main reason for me to subscribe to this channel😍😍
the bonus scene was the best of the lot.
The last scene was beautiful
Tenu Pyaar karna paye ga... Nahiiiiiii🤣<br>btw m a Pakistani...
A j... a j...a j...😂
I see nothing wrong with these clips.
Bahi intro music change kar. It&#39;s too cheesy.
I remember being absolutely traumatized after watching that Tejaswini scene.
Last scene was out of the world 😂😂
Bhai narration is good but why don&#39;t u show the scene
Superb
You can do a video on awkard tv show moments..the saas bahu serials
Are you gay? You seem to be.
Lolololololol
not enough guts in ur tummy to name the country which u keep calling across the border??
Tum chutiye ho, but awaj achchi hai
WTF did I just watch.
Name of the movie - Nacho nagin gali gali 😂😂😂😅 wtf ??
Bhai ye last wala kya tha.😀 Matlab kuch bhi.😁😁😁😁
भाई लास्ट वाला धमाल था...
These movies have had the max influence on the generation that was in their 30s in the 1980s. A lot of them from that generation believe Rapists are acceptable &amp; the woman is just a piece of meat. These people are the ones who are in the judiciary and many powerful positions today. But in reality I have never met a weak woman. There are so many women in our society who were sexually assaulted or raped but have come up in life with a lot of inner strength.
Bhai last wala😂😂😂
Last scene was like :- <br>Girl :- you&#39;ve to love me...<br>Boy :- no <br>Girl :- slapped the boy <br>Boy :- slapped her back <br>Girl :- .......<br>Boy :- ......
Jammy, have you covered Mr. Bhatti on Chutti? Another weird movie.
Plesse have a separate playlist for the kuch bhi videos on your youtube channel.
Tejasvini was horribly shocking ...where was the censor board 😄😄😄😄😄😄.  Great work bro😅😅
Nitish bhardwaj had nothing better to do? he played such a beautiful iconic role of krishna in mahabharata
Action jackson .??????????😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Adding this to my Try not to Cringe challenge

Nache nagin gali gali---so this is where Ekta Kapoor got the idea for naagin 1 2 3. Btw you should do one video on bizarre scenes from Indian tv shows
Last one 😂😂😂😂😂👌
Regarding Tejaswini. The end where the rapist married the girl and doesn&#39;t get punished. That&#39;s really disturbing.
Bhai.... you&#39;re voice is so irritating
Make some good videos too... About the best things in Indian cinema! Why highlight the bad things?
This guy really had a hard time to see this movies

Last one was so hilarious😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Most Indian movies are non sense.......
Last one wasn&#39;t Bizarre, it&#39;s called BDSM 😂😂😂
Please check out this song of Arshad Warsi. It’s very famous in which he kisses her forcibly in front of whole college. And everybody encourages him including girls. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5mTlQFTrU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5mTlQFTrU</a>
What the hell 😂😂
Ajay Devgn rocks!!
The bonus scene was hillarious
Dude your voice is amazing
I don&#39;t know if you have watched the movie &#39;Anubhav&#39; if you haven&#39;t, you must! It&#39;s hilarious!! 😂😂
Ajooba movie scene must watch pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=1765">29:25</a> <br>Movie link : <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta7KbMzqAPk">https://youtu.be/ta7KbMzqAPk</a><br><br>I am damn sure if you see this you will be shocked
Eargasm. Please keep talking.
हिंदी बोलो सर
Why u can&#39;t make in hindi
Last one .. I can&#39;t stop laughing
How do you watch these films unedited version?<br>When I was a kid and I used to watch DD National, DD shows their  edited versions. So I never saw all these scene until your channel shown it here.
Abe chutiye, in the first clip the girl was forcefully kissing the character so the slap was well deserved.... Koi ldka forcefully kiss kare to usey slap nhi padni chahiye kya?? Video bnane k lie bkchodi pel deta h kuch bhi tu
we want to see the scene not the commentary
Aagaye Turkey Thumbnail dekhkar...
Bonus scene is really hillarious n disgusting at the same time
The last one had me 😂😂 oh my God I&#39;m gonna slap my crush and let him slap me. I hope that&#39;ll work hahahahaha 😂😂😂
Action jackson- Ladka jabardasti krke ladki ko kiss kre to thappad marna sahi h...ladki jabardasti ladke ko kiss kre aur thappad khaye to galat h...EQUALITY kaha h baba
Chootya video.
Bro hats off to u if u really went through these movies.Big salute to your patience level
I agree with the scenes of tejaswani movies
The content is certainly good... but your voice makes it justtt sooo mesmerising.... 😍
WTF 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Okay I&#39;am in love with your voice 😍
You are too much underrated youtuber...🙏 bhai pyaar sa logon ki lete ho 😂✌️
I think you should make a behind the scenes video on how you make these videos. How you record your sound etc.
Jab admin paida hua uska baap bola...kuch bhi
one video on Indian serials
Sorry to say but that was boring
For the last scene , I could gouge my eyes out 😐.. It’s equally sad to know that for getting us the best contents u go through those bizzare movies 😂
I click on your one video...then i binge watch the whole night!! Love your videos
Today, I found out that are also from K- House from the honour boards. Very proud to see u do so well
Last 1 was outstanding
OK
American snow flakiness seems to be spreading all over the world....
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=107">01:47</a> you said the scene is sexiest bcoz guy slap her for sexually harassing him and is bizzare according to you. Now imagine a scene in vice versa gender and now guy will molester. Please don&#39;t be biased
Bollywood mein kuch kachra film  hai
<b>Okay. Let&#39;s swipe the genders</b><br><br>A woman walking near a pool, bleeding, a guy (half naked) from the pool describes his obsessions for her while staring at her with thirsty eyes.<br><br>The woman rejects and says she has a husband who she is loyal to.<br><br>The guy forcefully kisses her. The woman grabs him by his hair and slaps him into the pool.<br><br><b>would you still find it offensive Anmol ?</b><br><br><b>Hypocrisy</b> , isn&#39;t it ?<br><br><br>I absolutely love your videos, and surely get the points that you&#39;re trying to make. But sometimes, when we change the perspectives, some of the points seem to be male bashing.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fraud">#fraud</a> saiya .. , there is your content🤐
Oh my God ! The last one made me laugh the hardest. Indeed they were perfect for each other.
Action Jackson mast thi bhsdk
Bonus scene... can&#39;t stop laughing...😂
fuck... matlab kuch bhi
🤣🤣🤣🤣... awsome dude
Please do add perdesh movie i really found it annoying in many ways
The bonus scene alone was more than enough
Taaanu like kerna payee Ga??? Nahi 👋,, haaan
This was equally horrifying and hilarious
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=378">6:18</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Last seen !!! 😛😂😂 That was insanely insane 😓.
Bonus meme was hilarious😂
Angrezi jada bheje mein nhi jati phir v mast banaya
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=118">1:58</a> Wow. You completely ignored the fact that SHE sexually assaulted the dude. According to you, forcibly kissing others is &#39;just&#39; fine, right?
WTF did I just watch in the last 10 secs ??🤣🤣🤣🤣
This one&#39;s disturbing :(
That slap proposal 🤣😅 matlab kuch bhi!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=320">5:20</a> man this is intended to be disturbing... Have u never seen that movie the accused? At least try to differentiate between bullshit and thought provoking...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=120">2:00</a> well that&#39;s the problem with pseudo liberals... Woman slaps someone kissing  her against will : &#39;She is kind that she stopped at a slap&#39;<br><br>Woman kisses man against will in a logically poor movie, and man slaps: &quot;Why this society is so sexist! Let me add a cheap sarcastic caption&quot;
last one is the  best lollll
You saying that a villain shouldn&#39;t pass sexist comments on women??what He is supposed to do? who sexually assaulted women were labeled as &#39;villain&#39; right?? What was your point making this video? They showed what happens with a woman in society generally.... If you really wanted to show sexism then watch old movies and find sexist comments passed on women by &#39;heroes&#39; themselves.
I&#39;m not here to watch still photos from movies....
😂😂 soo goood!
Hilarious 😂 😂 😂 😂
ajay devgn slaps a girl who tries to force her upon him that is violence against woman? really? anupam kher is a villain in that movie why will he think and reason in a good way against a woman?
1.54 its called self defence against sexual harrassment. Just because she is a girl doesn&#39;t mean she can kiss anyone against their will. It is a sexual assault.. She deserves the slap. Stop being a feminist idiot. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23action">#Action</a> Jackson rocks... Lol
last one.... हद से पार...👌
Bhai tu “american”hai kya???sare indians ke naam tu “american accent”main kyu leta hai???
Shocking part is Indian dramas r still same while across the border dramas n now movies are at peak they r best n also watched by Indians
Because of the content you&#39;ve shown, i&#39;d like to say that Indian cinema has played major role in destroying the society. Bollywood can be a reason why more rapes occur in India. Ever since Bollywood&#39;s existence, rape was made so common that men thought that its just ok. I wont say bollywood is bad but its impact is huge. They showed rape and immoral scenes but never showed the justice by court. Bollywood hired pakistani actors &amp; singers and made such films that showed positive relations but today the industry got caught on its own. Shivsena fined Karan Johar. For the first time Karan Johar realized content is necessary. Today, even our politics has become like acting ground and all thanks to our Bollywood.
Aur yahi anupam khaar aaj BJP ka leader hai<br>Arey kahaan fass gaye yaar😥
review  gangs of wassepur
Well done😂👌👌
A person proposes another person,the other person rejects that person,so the proposer forcefully kisses the one who just rejected the person,so this person now slap HER.<br><br>this whole scene would be cool if it was &quot;HIM&quot; in the end,i guess.<br><br>basically the first scene in this video.
Can you please react on the upcoming movie &#39;mard ko dard nahi hota&#39;???
😂😂😂😂
I remember watching tejasvini as a child,that scene sent shivers down my spine. I was so damn traumatized by that 😫
Show original footage not edited parody version please...
Rare collection,but very dull and boring representation
What&#39;s wrong with the first one? She was forcing sex on him and he retaliated. He probably just didn&#39;t wanna get sexually assaulted by the woman.
Nagin wala to bhai hr nag nagin ki movie me yhi h. Aj tk smj nhi aaya vo nachte kyu h? ya hatho se bna hua fan dikha dikha k drate kyu h? Sidha das hi kyu nhi dalte. Had ho gai. See nagina, nigahe, nagraj, nagmani and many more

I love the intro sound man!!!
Bhai pura hindi me hi banao na bich me english bolo
😂😂😂😂😂
I am a fan of this channel, but i was surprised when a professor of forensic medicine suggested the whole class to check this page out as it spreads positivity and smiles.
All i can say is the so called stars today have done creepy stuff on screen for money in the 80s and 90s. What sucks is today they preach us how to respect  women. Most of the bollywood stars are hypocrites including all the khans and other big stars of 80s &amp; 90s. No wonder eve teasing and rapes increased in the country as the youth thought &quot;ladki ki na mein hi uski haan hai&quot;.
Im from across the border and yes bouns part was funniest of them all
The last scene was so funny!!! 😂😂😂
Can you give me a reason for not saying pakistan 🇵🇰 and saying from across the border ?
The last one in kinky love..
Slap krte hi pyar hogya
Sympathy for you!!<br>I can&#39;t go through a 7 minutes video and you might be watching full movies like this to make videos....<br>GRAND SLUTE!!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=169">2:49</a> when it started i died 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
These Films Produced Rape Culture In India
I think the last scene was the inspiration for movie 7 khoon maaf
that last scene is not exatareted my very own nephew had a vicious boxing match with his gf in front of me as I was standing there trying to process whats happening they both had ripped off their clothes then they went to my bedroom do their business and come out smiling real life is way crazier than movies.
The last one🤣😅😄

I was like 12-13 years old when I saw Jaan &amp; Tejasvini &amp; still cringed at those two scenes, like &quot;Why!? How!?&quot;😷😷

The bonous one 😂😂
Wo aakhari Wala Kya tha🤣🤣🤣??
Make a video on aakhiri gulaqm
Like your videos bro keep up the good work
Action Jackson ki wo ladki bad me takli bhi ho jati h. Thats some more wtf 😂😂
What rubbish all these movies are of 90s kk.
Anupam Kher movie seems to be a remake of Telugu film starring Chiranjeevi and most of the dialogues were taken from that film only.
But his taste for movies is not good. Otherwise his showcasing videos are interesting.
Hahahaah across the border wala b dekh liya  aap ne!!! Thankiu humara b kuch hissa hona chahye na is channel k content me.
There was a Sunny Deol and Sanjay Dutt movie in the 1990s called Yodha. It has a scene where Paresh Rawal,whose character in the film, Chaghanlaal, acts like a dog as Danny Denzongpa humiliates him. He becomes Chaghu, a pet dog, for the villain, Danny. This is the most ridiculous scene I’ve ever seen. I recommend you to check this out, I think it would fit as “matlab kuch bhi”...😂😂
One question, in Action Jackson what if Any Devgan was throwing himself at that girl, and the girl slapped him. I guess that would have been ok but the other way round is not.
The last one take the cake, I hide behind my pillow    🤣😂.
Despo anupam
What?!
Bollywood does not respect women.
Bonus scene was the best 😂
Haha last one was epic 😂😂 subscriber from Pakistan 🇵🇰
This forceful proposal thing is so disgusting.. like if a girl or guy says no, you go to extremes to make them say the answer you want WTF. I was watching Carry on Jatta and the moment the main actor started driving recklessly to kill them both after the girl said no, only to drive safely after she said yes to him is insane! I turned the movie off right there and then because it made me so angry...(it may have been a brilliant movie from then on but i felt so grossed out by that idea)<br>i never get angry like that but content like this is part of the problem with this world. its influencing people in the wrong way.  <br>I remember reading about a case where an Indian man accused of stalking two women in Australia escaped conviction after arguing he was influenced by Bollywood movies to believe that doggedly pursuing a woman would eventually cause them to fall in love. <br>&quot;In court, Baliga pleaded guilty and said the male leads in Bollywood movies always got the women to say yes by doggedly chasing them. His lawyer, Greg Barns, said in court that this was “quite normal behavior” for Indian men.<br>In the end, court magistrate Michael Hill accepted the argument that Baliga’s cultural background had influenced his behavior and let him go on the condition of good behavior for the next five years.&quot;
actor and actresses, directors and producers, they have the ability to to influence people.<br>THEY SHOULD USE IT PROPERLY!!
Omg the last one 😂😂😂
From the day you have called lukka chuppi a “masterpiece”, i have totally stopped watching your stuff 😂
I deeply respect u because u respect ladies
😂😂😂
You should include the &quot;Isko Shareer ki Garmi deni Padegi...: crapola between Amitabh BAchchan and Meenakshi which glorifies statutory rape of an unconscious woman in the movie &quot;Ganga Jamuna Saraswati&quot;
Imagine if a man is pushing himself on a woman, she can slap him and leave and doesn&#39;t have to regret for her action, same goes for man, if woman is pushing her self on man, he can slap her and leave and if he is hungry he can eat the chocolate as well, that&#39;s cool you gotta admit. So when I slap someone I don&#39;t slap the entire gender and slap the individual, I strongly believe it&#39;s ok to slap a woman or man if you have  good reason like saxual assault. I love this channel by the way
Last scene...Slap each other...<br>fall in love 😘😉
Last wala khatarnak tha
The last one is just... 😂😂😂
The last cat fight is epic! 🤣😂
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
I really feel bad for this guy as he watches films which nobody would watch for money also 😂 just to find these gems
Last one was epic.
Why do you say &quot;Across the border?&quot; And that too twice. You meant Pakistan right? What&#39;s stopping you from naming the country? Trigger hoke tumhe unsubscribe na karde isliye? Matlab cowardly liberalism ki bhi had hoti hai.
How many times u have said matlab kuchh bhi so far
Bro I am from Pakistan very funny scene boss boss humara Wala bohat jakas tha
I seriously just pucked after watching the last scene. What was that SLAP-stick comedy?
Your videos are awesome 😍
chup be sale English mat jaar
You just keep getting better and better😎😎
Hey, Love your videos. I think it would work well if you add English subtitles on few of your Hindi movie sequences alone. It would be of great help for us South Indians and I think it can attract more international viewers. Just a suggestion lol
Shahib jee tho 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Scene narrate karne se accha dikha deta bhai! Time waste kara diye
I loved the bonus one. 😅
Why u do long intro ?????
Bonus Scene was hilarious 🤣🤣
What the heck man.  They are raping her and his friends are cheering him wtf
The last scene of sahib jee is a retro style of 50 shades of grey 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey how about you do a video based on the same thing from Hollywood movies. It would be a breath of fresh air
Bhai mat dekha kar ye sab 😂😂 ek din pagla jayega ..... 🤪
In 1990&#39;s all these scenes were fine. There was very limited connectivity and it was one of the amazing feeling watching a movie. Didn&#39;t care for content much. For reference compare nowadays songs which are no less than some bizzare lyrics and nudity only vs the melodious old songs. Bam Chigy Bam Bam vs Tere Bina Zindagi se Koi Shikwa tho nahi (Lata and Kishore) Cmon Dude.. Thumbs up.
houseful  also had 2 suicide threats by Akshay Kumar
Kuch b wala dialogue ab bore hogaya. Stop saying it now. Otherwise videos are good
Day by day your content is turning feminist shit.
Last one was the epic one 😂😂😂
Omg i watch nearly your every video and it&#39;s really good and i can see your hardwork but i don&#39;t why there 400k subs only<br>You deserve more!
Action Jackson scene is logical. I mean women and man are equal. Agar ladki ko jabardasti kiss karoge to thappad pade to logical hai, so man can slap a girl if she force him.
Tejaswini was disturbing for sure ...
Dude!! Suggestion for you.. you can do a small cam in the screen-corner with the video like a reaction kind of !! People will love that.. Voice and Reaction and Creation !!
I just want to love Anmol Jamwal once. His voice is so cute and hot
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ur superb mr.jammypants....ur research in every video,ur voice &amp; ur intelligence is superb
G
Out of context editing with music overlay and fast forward. Makes anything look funny. <br>Villans and negative characters are shown doing those acts to show what is bad in society not to promote and celebrate such things.
🤣watched nache nagin gali gali at 2 a.m with my sister. And I must tell it was a hilarious adventure.
Reach to 1 million bro soon ,,, ur content is really awesome
Watch a movie BETA movie of Anil Kapoor in that movie there is a song in which madhuri explains suhagrat in song
Jammy I think you need mental checkup after watching these types of movies
indian movies should be banned
Sri Krishna best ever character portrayed by Nitish Bharadwaj .
Ok nagin is my favourite.
the way u speak is grt😊
We need to know where the Director of Sahib Jee gets his weed. That shit seems strong.
The regressiveness depicted in rhe movies in the 80s amd 90s was largely responsible for such behaviour carried out by young boys in schools. They are of ourse part of the Indian psyche which is manifest from a lot of comments by Indian piliticians towards female politicians.<br>The Sahibjee scene was indeed hilarious.
Hahaahahahaha Hahahahahaha <br>Last one &quot;Tenu pyaar karna padega&quot; nahi slap, smile and then hugged each other 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
His Hindi punchline is really hilarious ! <br>Love from Bangladesh ❤️
can you also make the same for south Indian movie please ?
Name of the edm song.....plzzzzzz.......
Bonus scene is hilarious
😂😂😂
On first clip -<br>Bhai ladki bina izazat kiss kare aur banda thapad bhi na maare..<br>Agar ladka kiss karta tho ladki dho deti... Woh cool lagta tujhe..<br><br>With all due respect to women... Have some respect for men too
Tenu Pyaar karna paegaa
Really the last one was epic scene 🤣🤣🤣
Dude your voice resembles with karthik aryan&#39;s voice.
Bro can you please do Analysis for regional movies also? There&#39;s  real awesome content in regional ones as well especially the Malayalam and Tamil ones
What across the border ?<br>Say it from Pakistan
😂😂😂😂👌👌👌
U shud take a dig on shola aur shabnam

The bonus one is for ultra legends....😎
bhai woh nache nagin vala edm music konsa h
Please make a video on Bizarre Make ups
Who thinks last one was awesome hit like 😂😂🤣🤣
Mannn... these scenes are nothing... one of the craziest  scenes you will find in the last 15 to 20 minutes of the 1979 movie Suhaag... starring biggies like Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor.. it involves a BLIND Shashi riding a bike on a busy road AGAINST traffic.. guided verbally by pillion rider Big B... and many such ridiculous sequences till the movie ends... do watch it... 🙈🙈🙈🤣🤣🤣
Anupam Kher should&#39;ve simply said &quot;Behen Darr gayee.
Last slape😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=385">6:25</a> i swear i laughed so suddenly my lip cracked and bleeded

Last movie..<br>Time to leave earth...
You forgot to mention that in tejasveni movie villian not only rape and kills Innocents he also burns urmila matolkat to death in her classroom full of students and a teacher  just because she ignored the villian in college  and the cherry on the top is the villian gets forgiven in the end unharmed in condition that he marries a girl he raped.what a movie full shet nerve wracking content
Tejasvani the whole movie is disturbing their intention was right though
Come on man you are now at the edge of becoming a moral police for bollywood. I agree some times movies go over the top and create totally sensless and insensitive scenes. However, the problem is only when the movie tries to justify that. If a movie want to show a villain despicable and disgusting, the dialogs and scenes are written like that, that doesn&#39;t mean the movie is endorsing that. Also, its a film not real life, it doesn&#39;t need to be sanskari always. Movies show various sides of the society, its on us what to take.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=310">05:10</a> freaking bastards.... Really that scene is so disturbing 😪........<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=385">06:25</a> WTF I just saw🙄
Last one was epic😂
The across the border scene was really as icing on the cake...... 💯% kuch bhi scene....👌👌👌😅😅😅
Nice video bro..
u are always right .. 👍
Have you watched  &quot; Raanjhna&quot;........This movie was a shit.....shattered plot....poor dialogue....fuddu..story
WTF pyar karna padega aur do thappad ke baad ho gaya
Nache Nagin Gali Gali........You made this more funny Jammy by adding your own music....hahhahaha
Bonus was awesome😀😁😂😂😂
Once again.......haha.....I&#39;m speechless..🤣🤣🤣🤣...great job dude....I&#39;m in awe with this channel
Lest wala owesome tha....👍
@Tried and refused productions dude u sound so much like dhruv  ratheee😑😀..hillarious video BTW🙌
Are u still alive after watching ths shit?
I have seen that nagin one...thanks to my parents...
Your videos are hilarious and fun to watch. Nice that you do so much research. I was born in the early 80&#39;s and have seen many of these movies on TV and VCR. I recommend you check out &#39;Saugandh&#39; which is the first movie of Akshay Kumar. It&#39;s available on YouTube.
You slap me.. I slap you.. and BaM ! We fall in love ... 😆😆😆😆😆 <br>Matlb kuuuuccchhhh bbhhii ..!!!!
Oh my gawwd 😂😂😂
matlab kuch bhi <br>Love you bro ❤😍
The first scene had nothing wrong, if the genders were reversed then the girl would have been an example for empowerment. Such hypocrisy duh.
That bonus scene though..😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=378">6:18</a> .... And they say romance is dead
Similar videos over and over again. Post something new bro.
The Ajay Devgan one.. You&#39;re clearly unaware of how passion and obsession plays with one&#39;s Psyche and how attraction isn&#39;t a very logical emotion.<br>I&#39;ve witnessed relatively similar things happen quite a lot to know that there&#39;s evolutionary roots behind it.<br>Now I don&#39;t condone it, but it is what it is ..
Bonus scene👏👏
That sahib jee scene is an epic meme😂😂
Ye kya thahh 😂😂
I feel my 7 mins of life are wasted on knowing about it ! Please focus on promoting good films.
The last bonus scene was out of this world. Epic
Meenakshi seshadri scene amd crissborder scenes were awesome...But tthe bgms were an icing on the cake🤣🤣🤣
Are you actually earning money ? <br>Because you are showing copy right scenes of movies..
Last clip is like fifty shade of grey in pakistani version.
Final one was the best among all
Last clip couple is like thappad se dar nai lagta pyaar se lagta hai reverse version..😀🤣😀🤣
You just keep on showing the bad side of industry and how bad men are, and pretend that you&#39;re a supporter of women empowerment, and try to show that women are always victimized by men so in that way you can be called as a modest person and have as many women subscribers as you can.
The last one is epic .what the hell the maker were thinking...
Change your channel name to &quot;Overblown Adjectives Man&quot;
I do have a point regarding Action Jackson scene, if a girl forces on you even you say NO, then slapping her is not cool. But if a boy force himself and get beaten up is empowering. Then I don&#39;t know who is sexist here
There is nothing wrong with first scene from action jackson..<br>Just reverse the genders...  if a man pulls a woman and forcefully kisses her.. She would also have slapped him.. Ajay devgan did the right thing..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=382">6:22</a> I cant see anything weird about this scene. It happens every night 🤔
Bonus is just 😂😂😂
The bonus one OH GOD
Matlab kuch bhiiiii
Nagin was a gully girl
try to watch r rajkumar it&#39;s awful
I love ur voice
In Sabse bada khiladi movie when akshay gets married to the girl he proudly says that he has the right to have sex with her just because she is her wife. These were normal things in 80s and 90s movies man used to feel proud in doing such crazy things. Now a days also if villain says something to girl it is bad but if hero does the same thing it is referred as love. Like in judwa movie.
Bhai tujhe nobal prize milna chiye
That girl he interviews bhai, is not jst any girl. That&#39;s Nivedita Saraf. A great theatre/film actress. Also, Ashok Saraf &#39;s wife.
Have you watched South Indian movies. 😂😀😂
Nice..u can give any other name but know they have to show him a hardcore hindu so named d character dharamchand with tilak in his head.
Falling in love after being slapped.Kya baat hai👏👏👏
Omg that last one!!!
Last one was hilarious<br>Literally fools🤣
Hey hey hey I watched that movie Jaan as a child and I thought that she is going to die when the water finishes. I was so scared to hold water in my hands for few days. Lol after all these years now I understood that fucking scene!
Hahahaha  last  one was 😹😹😹😹🙌
This doesnt have Aks...
Kal kis kis ka maths ka exam hai?
Man , i got a problem with the first thing you showed. If a man is trying to force a woman for sex, its perfectly ok for the woman to slap him and beat the hell out of him, all other people near him will also beat the man up , but when a women does it , and the man does the same thing ( a slap ), u showcase him like this !! <br>I found that chocolate part and saying that she is not a girl quite weird and pathetic , but i dont understand why a man cannot slap a girl who is forcefully kissing him ( abuse ) for his defence if a girl can do the same. <br><br>Just my view , i respect everyone equally , woman or man or transgender , whoever is under attack( that&#39;s the term a woman would use if the scene was vice versa), i will help them.<br>Peace
Old watched movies make a sudden memories run and comes back from the back of your head...this is super pathetic movies
the last one🤣🤣
<b>NAACHE  NAGIN  GALI GALI 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 NAAM SUNKE HI HASI NAHI RUK RAHI</b>
Channel is getting better day by day.💯💯
Bonus scene is awesome 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Find me anyone, who can narrate better than this guy.. He slaps all those who narrate with fake accents...
The ending was epic 😂👍
I only like you......
Your content is always kaabil e tareef... You are doing good work.<br>Wanted to add info about Tejaswini movie, in the movie later on the lady cop advises the rapist to marry his victim and asks his friends, who were cheering him to rape, now to cheer him to marry the same girl. <br>I mean that is bizzare. Irony of the movie claiming to be empowering women. <br>It sends a wrong message. Missed the whole point of women empowerment.
Bonus was really a BONUS
I don&#39;t know how you find it sexist that a guy slaps the girl who forcefully kisses him
Last one is lit, tenu pyaar karna payega 😂😂😂😂😂
Last wala 😁😂😁
Last one was epic😅
Hi is it possible that you make a video about how bad the TV serials are today as compared to 20 years back. You have made one content wise but I&#39;m talking of a particular k serial that changed the way TV serials are made just for show time. Eg unnecessary music, zooming in and out of the faces of characters. No matter how the shoe starts it ends up being really cocky. Eg Udaan then ultimately it&#39;s all about love jealousy and revenge aur kuch reh he nai Gaya jaise
Disturbed mind😥😥
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂👍the last part was hilarious
<b>Matlab KOOOOOOOOOOOCCCCCHHHH Bhiiiiiii</b> ....  Squad Attendance...
In last, wtf is happen?
Plz make a video on the most convincing double roles in bollywood.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=322">5:22</a> The same kind of scene takes place in Jodie Foster movie THE ACCUSED...you should&#39;ve acknowledged that.
Shivers of Cringe have rolled down my spine !!
I&#39;m from Pakistan, n I appreciate you for adding the &quot;across the border&quot; scene :-D
HOLY SHIT <br>WTF!!! was the last one
that edm tho :):):):)
Matlab kuch bhi ......
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=185">3:05</a> now that&#39;s what I call some dope ass editing
Film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23action">#action</a> Jackson puri film hee itni torture thi itni wahiyat lekin sabse ghatiya wahiyat aur disturbing scene mujhe laga jab vishi gayab ho jaata hai manasvi ke gundey vishi yani ajay devgan ke dost kunal roy kapur ko torture karke pochte hai woh kaun tha jo AJ ke bhes mein aaya tha aur tabhi mansvi wahaan aati hai aur kunal roy kapur ko woh sexy kiss karti hai aur puchti hai ki AJ kahaan hai woh scene mujhe itna distribing laga itna ghatiya laga ki matlab manasvi kaise kunal roy kapur ko kiss kar sakti hai jabki kunal roy kapur uske kabze mein hai aur uske dushman ka dost hai
Tejasvani scene is really yawr boht hi zayada bekaar tha exactly
Dude, i use to like your channel. But lately your videos have become obsolete and on meaningless topics. I can make another video &quot;Here is tried and refused production - Most stupid and meaningless topics, @jammypants made on his chanel&quot;...<br><br><br>STOP uploading stupid stuff. Sorry but un-subscribing from your channel.
Last one hands down best ishqzaadays :p
I also felt that Action Jackson was a shit movie.<br>But I don&#39;t think the criticisation of AJ slapping the woman is valid as this just shows a hypocrisy.<br>She was forcing herself on him, without his consent and he slapped her caz she should&#39;ve been in her limits.<br>Just do a gender reversal and reimagine it and see if the slap is well-deserved or not.
kya aap ghost seriease wale  u tuber h????😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=393">6:33</a><br>Well that escalated quickly 😂
Hona jaye ye,,,,,,,,,,taare jameen par🤣🤣
What the fuck is that voyeuristic rape scene???? Ewwwww....so gross
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=318">5:18</a> WTF
OMG what a work out!
Are you drunk?
Omg I can&#39;t stop laughing 😄😄😆😆😃😃
Last wala scene dekh ke sirf ek hi question dimaag mein aata hain <br>Aur inko Kashmir chahiye !!! 😂😂😂
Try watching Desh drohi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=81">1:21</a> showing their ssksskgcksssssksssss
In action jackson when she tried to kiss him after getting rejected so i guess a slap is justified <br>man tries to kiss after he was rejected deserves a slap there is no argument over there<br>But i guess if a woman does that she also deserves a slap dont you think
Ok so for the Action Jackson scene, I just have to say that there are too many double standards going on. If I guy pulled her close and tried to kiss him and the girl slapped him into a pool, no one would care. But bcz a guy did it instead, everyone is pissed off. Such a white knight move smh....
Shit what just happened in the end😂😂😂😂😂
How did tejaswini gets passed by the censor board, just shows what people were entertained by. They don&#39;t need it today coz adult content on the internet is easily available, nothing has actually changed. It&#39;s about money. Nowadays films are making more money with cleaner content coz they get a lotta business from overseas where people are not that interested in watching adult content coz they have money to buy other important pleasures of life. In the 90&#39;s the films catered to the rural audience so that&#39;s what they wanted and they still want it but get access to adult content via internet. Many many people watch adult content which includes sex without consent too, that&#39;s the reality.
Bhai kaise dekh leta he tu ye sab🤪
Okay so for the first movie you blamed ajay&#39;s character for hitting a women but she was the one who   misbehaved n tried to get intimate with him! Thats her fault .if a man&#39;s character was doing the same n the girl slaps him then ppl will clap ( which is right) but same should apply to men also na .usne slap kia wo tume dikh gya but pehle ldki us par chad rhi thi wo ni dikha?

Salute to you. Thank goodness you&#39;re not insane after watching these horrible films😂😂😂
Even We Pakistanis Are Making Fun At This Scene Which Is Played In The End....😂😂...Well I saw it On Facebook .😂
I can&#39;t decide which video on your channel is the best one because each and everyone of them seems to be the best.👍<br><br>BTW  watched &quot; Photograph &quot;, it is really an amazing movie. Thank you for the recommendation. 🙂

Jammy pants, you missed a disgusting scene from your fav movie lucka chupi you reviewed recently. <br><br>The scene where pankaj tripathi sees kartik aryan and thinks he is dating a married women. He approaches her and say &quot;mujhe bhi chaiye&quot;. <br><br>I am sure you didnt find it disgusting. <br><br>I dislike your video and will comment on each video of yours till you give me a reply. <br><br>Or i may have to sadly say you are a hypocrite. And i wish your subscribers read that.

Good South indian movies available on YouTube
The last one tho 🤣🤣
I just watched Romel and Juggal...it was great kinda overdramatic towards the end like everyone Bollywood movie but I still loved it....you should give it a try
Nothing is more sexist than your channel, if a man is sexually harrassed by women, should he just accept it? Hitting a women is wrong? If a women does the same wouldn&#39;t you call it empowerment??
Bro your Hindi bits are fun only because they are rare...so don&#39;t overdo it please...

Bizzare list <b>Anmol</b> 😑 I have also seen Tejaswini &amp; the scene you mentioned was disappointing/heart wrenching, it was so horrifying that it left me numb for a few seconds, (where was the censor board then) 😶😏😶😑...as for the movie Jaan, nothing could be done for the 90s scripts ideas...they were weird, absurd... But thnx neways for the video <b>Matlab Kuch Bhi</b> episode
Ajay bodies is full of fats trying to prove healthy well learnt from Salman about body then  be shirtless n yes your attitude too change it .. faded actor ajay
Kya fayda<br>Filmakers are not watching ur videos...
Seriously These Kind Of Absurd &amp; Bizarre Movies Are Exact Reason Why In Our Country Crime Against Women Are Rapidly Increasing!!!!!!Honestly We As Audience Should Actually Stop Watching It In Name Of Bloody Entertainment!!!!!Even The Makers Has To Stop Creating These Kind Of Shits!!!!!!!!Movies Like Total Dhamaal Are No Doubt Is Prime Example Of That Which Has Filled With So Many Matlab Kuch Bhi Moments Constantly!!!!!!!
They are not shape shifting snakes! They are ichhadhari naag &amp; naagin! You gotta respect or else, they&#39;ll bite you! 😄
You should watch this film Hifazat (1987). Totally hilarious &amp; stupid.
1989 same year I born , so sad.
Am I the only one who disagrees with the first one? I mean @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=109">1:49</a> she forcibly kisses him and he slaps back which I don&#39;t think was wrong or misogynistic. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=118">1:58</a> comeon let&#39;s be honest here, if the gender were reversed in this scene then the girl would&#39;ve been hailed as brave and strong woman.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=389">6:29</a> ...thaddap ke baad aakhein khul gyi aur pyar ho Gaya 😂😂😂😂😂👏

The last one really was a Bombshell hahahaahahaha
The last one accross the boarder is epic!
Cringe level = infinity...🤣

That last bonus scene🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=118">1:58</a> A woman would have done the same to a man and would have gone to the police,I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s sexist in that scene.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=119">1:59</a> i don&#39;t think that&#39;s what they wanted to show. I didn&#39;t go any deep or anything but i think the purpose was to show that if a boy was at her place and kissed the girl without her consent then she would&#39;ve also slapped him. <br>Same goes to the boy, if someone forcefully kisses them, they have every right to slap.<br>And this is comming from a girl.
Hey TRP.. can we have an episode of retro bizarreness? In the form of Manoj Kumar, Raj Kumar et al? Please... There&#39;s plenty of &quot;kuch bhi&quot;s throughout the history of our beloved bollywood
Last one was hilarious 😂😂😂
Seriously ridiculous..
I totally agree with you.All Movies should be completely sanskari . Showing a rape scene in a movie can have a bad impact on young generation.
Mtlb suchme kuch bhi tha last vala😂😂😂
The Best Movies of Ajay Devgan Ji is &quot;ACTION JACKSON&quot; &amp; &quot;HIMMATWALA&quot;<br>😂😂🤣🤣😬😬
Last scene took the cake
That scene from tejasvini really disturbed me . I&#39;m still in shock .
U simply deservs 10 million subs,,,,,the beat channel on utube
I really like voices of 2 Youtubers from my Subscription List...<br>The First One is this Guy from Channel Tried &amp; Refused Productions...I had learned many English Words and Speaking English Language with Good Fluency from him only...<br>The Second One is Aayush from the Channel Neon Man...<br>They both have excellent voice...The way they both narrates their videos is awesum...Aayush from Channel Neon Man is a 16-17 Years Old Boy and Everytime he comes with a great knowledge of what is happening in Youtube Community, Instagram and Twitter Accounts of Celebrities...But his voice do not match with his face...When he had revealed his face for the 1st time, I was Totally Shocked to see a Small Kid running a Big Channel...He talks in Hindi, But his accent of speaking Hindi Language and Sharing Youtube, Instagram NEWS is the Best...
there is a scene in the movie &quot;Holiday A soldier is never off duty&quot; In which sonakshi sinha slaps her father and then take away money from his wallet.<br>The movie although was good but this was such a bizzare scene
Tenu pyaar krna hanga😂
Salute to you bro as you just get through all this unimaginable tourters just to provide us a laugh.
Yes... Still your hindi gives cringe 😅💕😬.. Not hate..<br>Big fan.. Really
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=363">6:03</a> scenes like this have a bad impact on the entire generation making people to think that committing suicide on refusal is romantic or it only proves your love!! People turned into psychos
Tejasvani shocked me as a little girl. I just wanted to slap the person who came up with this idea

The 1st scene was unrequired shit but not sexist, the girl was forcing man even after his denying, so he slapped, imagine a boy forces a girl for... even after her denying so the girl slaps her , is it sexist?
Bro show hero kuch bhi moments showing villians moments was totally illogical because they are the bad guys their mind set will be like that only how can say kuch bhi for gabbar singh killing takur&#39;s family scene because he is the villian

D last scene...🤣🤣🤣🤣 hysterical..
Chutiya video
That last scene tho was 🔥🔥<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nothing wrong in the Action Jackson scene, that woman was forcing herself on Ajay, so Ajay had the full right to slap her!!
We are okay with Sridevi dancing on been tune  with a tantrik and  his dancing subordinates in nagina and nigahein when she needs to fight with her enemy (yah FIGHT which is obviously impossible for flesh loving bollywood). Still the the scene is iconic in her life 😀😀😀 ,but dancing Meenakshi Sheshadri with single  tantrik is too much funny. 😮😮😮<br>Even though the movie didn&#39;t worked well , but both the movies were regressive for sure. I agree both were fantasies and findingg logic is useless lekin phir bhi  ek scene iconic or ek stupid kaise ho sakta hai ?
And still bollywood producing crap.
Bonus secne was more funny then Varun dhawand
Hahahahaha last one was too much. I have seen it before. Tainu pyaar karna paiga — wham!
Thanks jammy! For adding my suggestion to your video ... really made my day 😂

Bhai..fañ since yu had 70-80k... please make video on most awesome Bollywood movie scene that will make you speechless
End was 🔥🤣
The last one was the cherry on top..😂😂
I grew up in the 90s and trust me girls then were very different from millenials....I noticed that girls wanted boys to chase them and prove to them how much they loved them...the so called molestation was not thought of then....movies shown then was a reflection of the society....the current generation is different so they make fun of the precious generation....the next gen will make fun of u.. this is natural
I respected your content and I have been a subscriber of your channel for a very long time now... But I feel sad after seeing this... You felt so disgusted that you didn&#39;t even call out my country&#39;s name and said across the border?? Shame on you
Tenu Pyaar Karna Padega!!!
Is Anupam Kher perpetually takla ?
Matlab kuch bhi...

If I forcefully kiss a girl won&#39;t she slap me?
That Bonus really is Bonus 😂😂
Bro in Action Jackson..  Just imagine if there is boy who pulls a girl and kiss forcefully.. She will obviously slap him..  So if a boy done that what&#39;s wrong?
The bonus scene is just out of the world mind blowing!!
Wtf was this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=377">6:17</a>
Watch netflix Sex education web series  best web series
So if a man pulls a girl towards her and forcefully tries to kiss her, and the girl slaps him, is that also not okay?<br>Why double standards then? I don&#39;t understand this
Last one wass lol lol
The last scene in the video inspired me so much. now i will slap my crush to make her love me.
Okay but why did the naagin sequence fitted the music perfect.

OK on which weed censor board in 90s I mean <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GRIl4AcV0&amp;t=314">5:14</a> was just cross the limit so bad how that actually allowed in theater that too in 90s
I started watching as soon as I got the notification that Tried and Refused has uploaded another video, I knew it would be a great one and he didn’t disappoint!
I was confused intilaly when he said across the border. After listening Punjabi, no doubt it was Pakistan.
Come on man, I mean we r living in a time where we watch game of thrones and appreciate its content. I don&#39;t think any of the over the top violent scenes can top the scenes of  game of thrones . These scenes r created so that we hate the antagonist and want the protagonist to beat the shit out of him, that&#39;s how it works. Adult people shouldn&#39;t be affected by these scenes(children shouldn&#39;t watch these scenes).
The last scene was hilarious 😁😁😁😁
Bhaiya after seeing the last scene i have decided to hit my crush / good friend n see if he hits back as its the true sign of &quot;true love&quot; 😁😁😂😂
I pity you man.... You have to go through this just to make a video for us...My sympathy is with you❤❤
