NICK MUST BE A CAPRICORN
No cuz ellan is so funny
Как же в Индии любят красный цвет, они хоть понимают, что слишком много красок всё портят?
She always speak hindu
They are normally 5 days
How sweet.
jai mata di
She&#39;s not only the lucky one Nick is lucky too
Queen Priyanka is so awesome❤️ she’s where she is today because of her hard work, it has NOTHING to do with Nick and she has everything she has right now because she earned it, LOVE HER💝
God bless you ❤️❤️❤️❤️😊😘🥰😍👍👍👌👌👏👏
I love you so much priyanka ❤️🌹❤️🌹. You are looking beautiful ❤️🌹 and gorgeous ❤️🌹❤️🌹.
The most beautiful couple ever
In India a wedding is just like a whole feast that lasts for days..They have different different mini function on separate days..
Priyanka stopped Ellen dead in her tracks
अबे साले तुमको पेरिया है
Destiny
They really are a great couple. So genuinely nice and friendly.
Ellen emang benar2 lucu yah...  Jadi penasaran masak kartu tarot ada wajah nick jonasnya hahahah
Today she had a hindu wedding with nick tomroww she will changed nick to hindu..one away from god 2 closer to many gods
The host was not do kind on Priyanka
Weddings in India and Pakistan takes longer
I didn&#39;t heard anything about nick Jonas before Priyanka Chopra married him.
There are many singers in America and Nick Jonas is not that famous here.  He wasnt a big &quot;hit&quot; here in America.  But i admire him for his good heart &amp; family oriented.  I hope he treats his wife and kid good because Priyanka is a wonderful female.
Ellen we may have the same birthdays 26 4
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=97">1:37</a> she sounded like cardi😂
We Indian know Jonas brothers coz of Priyanka
I know Nick Jonas only because of Priyanka
❤❤❤
بریانکا زیباست 😍😍
WHAT  A   YOUNG   HUSBAND!!!
LOVELIEST   BRIDE  ON  EARTH  EXCEPT  FOR  HER   LIPS
RITUALS !!!!!!!!<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
As proud indian... <br>She didn&#39;t want talk in diff accent and she is as real as it while talking also
Someone please educate Ellen on how big of a star Priyanka is. The Jonas brothers have nothing on her.. all of their base combined! Ellen can surely learn humility from her if nothing else.
Looks like Ellen never tried interviewing Aiswarya Rai
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=115">1:55</a> lol 😂 Ellen is a such playerrr, my friend worked for a while in Priyanka&#39;s team and Ellen &amp; Portia were very much invited to the wedding...not just Ellen, other celebs like Dwayne, Harry, Meghan, etc were also invited AND they sent good wishes too stating that due to schedule/protocol issues they won&#39;t be able to attend...Ellen probably doesn&#39;t check with her team of the events she&#39;s called to 😂<br><br>Anyway I love them both 😍 I wish Ellen could make it to the wedding (or acknowledge the invitation atleast)
Pryanka made me love India she’s really a beautiful person and is really big deal his really lucky to have her❤
PC most loved Indian actress who made the nation proud several times. She&#39;s a Global icon. I wish her and her loving family a big success ahead. Love to Malti Mari
Wear proper clothes Priyanka !!!!
Priyanka congrats
Watched.🚫
Deepika Padukone was certainly more comfortable with Ellen than Priyanka.. With her it &#39;s like a tiff here.
farting accent 🤣
Yes... Correct... Me from southern part of india.. Kerala... Hr in our marriage... Mostly 1000 above people in marriage day
Love you so much Priyanka 💕💕💕💕👑👑
That concert 🤣
Her sense of humour is awesome...and confidence is out of the world.....I do not like celebrities much but she&#39;s the one who inspires a lot of women in real 👏👏
The same situation here in Uzbekistan 😂😂
She ( Ellen)  makes it sound like Priyanka married up.. LOOK AT THAT WOMAN …she is FLAWLESS… Ellen is just a bitter angry Lebanese😂
What a sexy color of priyanka
Dream come true by the tarot card👍
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
The tarot cards indicated SRK,not Nick.
Ellen, there is a world outside ur country...
sad Ellen wouldn&#39;t be invited in any Indian wedding
Priyanka b like &quot;&quot; baap rai yeh tou doti khol rhi hain &quot;&quot;🤣🤣🤣
She is so superficial and superfluous......
I love Priyanka
Priyanka also made Jonas brother famous in Bangladesh also✌️
Ellen was a bit rude
Nick is so lucky to have Priyanka as his wife❤️
She is my favorite😍
😂
Green card Chopra 🤣
Beautiful and talented Priyanka Chopra Jonas
I did not know about nick before Priyanka Chopra&#39;s marriage 😂😂😂 but before marriage priyaka already famous in many nations
Grandma priyanka
Happy Diwali PC
True Indian weddings last really long
Literally in this short time, she and indian just proved she’s more smarter than the host Alien😁
Nice
❤❤❤❤❤
My brother wedding simple in village more than 4500 people 🤭🤭🤭😀😀😜😜
Well, so I have noticed this now that Ellen said she wasn’t invited to their wedding and then Priyanka says “she didn’t respond to their invitation” wow Ellen 👏🏼
Красота какая! Всех благ и благословений от Создателя🙌😘💃🔥Много любви счастья 💗🤗
Grand star wedding ⭐️<br>Littel life saving .<br>Ellie mother - in - low : very well Responding power .
Their love is so fake specially Nick’s.Priyanka May love him but he doesn’t.priyanka could have been happier
I love priyanka she’s my culture and I love it
Not a great host... Constantly putting Ms Chopra down...pl Watch priyanka&#39;s work and achievements... She has made India v proud.. And am not even a fan... <br><br>Some of her notable work: Barfi, Mary Com, Bajirao Mastani, Fashion, Kaminey, Don, Aitraz, Dil Dhadakne Do
She is outstanding dedicated loyal actress in Bollywood.
Ellen is cunning for Indians
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=214">3:34</a>
Priyanka nailed it man 😀😀🔥🔥🔥🔥😆😆
Nick- our national jiju

She is so fake!
My favorite heroine is one and only lovely priyanka chopra 🥰🥰🥰🥰
In India if you see a wedding happening somewhere  ..you can literally enter the wedding and eat the delicious food and no one would complain...like literally anyone can come.
Really I lv priynka
Priyanka lies so much just saw a part of it here
Hey ram kaisi kaise news dikhate hai vande matram
what did ellen by saying priyanka was lucky?<br>It was the other way around. Dude made the first move
Ellen always speak rubbish, She is lucky or nick is the luckiest guy who got priyanka chopra . He is not even 10% what she have made herself without any help globally. No one globally has achieved so much, as she is.
💜💜💜💜💜
Big fan of Priyanka chopra ❤❤😊
People don&#39;t like you when you tell truth priyanka isn&#39;t beautiful.
So one of the first times that she ever proposed to him was when he was 16 and she was 27???.....lol but anyways they are a really great couple now.!!!!
भाभी बहुत गन्दी दिख रहा हो 🤔
Christian ceremony?? It was civil marriage not a church one I&#39;m confused
Maybe using every boby knowledge me lmean not interested you country&#39;s
Priyanka is so beautiful , Nick is so lucky to have her ! I love you priyanka ❤️❤️❤️
All of your shows are perfect and you know how to hold your shows in funny way
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=240">4:00</a> that&#39;s embarrassing
Priyanka chopra is one of fvt heroine 🖤❤️
❤❤❤❤
Priyankaaaa....babyyy.. Lieeeedddd   🥰🥰... Ohh i dint knew himmmmmmmm..... Jonas brothersss😄😄😄😄😄😄
Male shoulders
Just to compare... I had 500 guests for my 10th birthday and we are middleclass peeps 😅
she&#39;s got enough money n fame before she even knew Nick forget  marry him..<br>Ellen if ever comes to India should definitely be interviewed by our journalist Barkha Dutt!
I like your show. But your angry at me.
Is it a transgender marriage...
Hello good morning fantastic Love marriage wale Hain appa Kong
Nick is lucky to have priyanka chopra.. She is intelligent, miss world, beautiful.. Full package ❤❤
I did not know Jonas unti PC got married!!
World know they all
I can&#39;t believe she had only 200 people at her wedding for being Indian and super famous. That&#39;s the equivalent of having 20 people at an American wedding- not even kidding..
Beautiful Priyanka Chopra Jonas ❤️❤️
My favourite Priyanka Chopra Jonas ❤️❤️
Ya indyan orta kpr q nh phanti
Every one knows who is the lucky one..Ellen&#39;s behavior was Too unfunny but loved how priyanka backfired &amp; handle her with a sweet smile whole time on her face...
We Indians  don&#39;t know who is nick Jonas before  priyanka chopra  gave him identification in India too by marrying him
Еще бы субтитры на русском!Обожаю Еллен! 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Nick is lucky
Priyanka Chopra deserve to be her place amazing proud of you dear ❤️
🥰
He is sooo average not goodlooking by any standard
1000 ppl is alot .Priyanka let&#39;s not overdo it.. 😌
It&#39;s like a planned one 🧐how it is. Surely not  unfortunately !!!
Love you Priyanka ❤️
On a very serious note I guess Nick is more lucky to have The Priyanka Chopra as his wife 💗
أرادات أن تثبت لها أنها تزوجت به عن طريق السحر
So pretty
🤮
That&#39;s true @ my rules
Congratulations mam
There was nothing intimate about that wedding. It was a big showy affair
Where&#39;s tarro reader  I need her 😃😃😉😃😆😆
So millenium aawaaz right!!!
❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=114">1:54</a> We were so offended that you didn’t even respond to our invite
Law of attraction 😂
Great edit Ellen to cool
Haha, you gotta love the moment at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=119">1:59</a>.
Gundi khoti
She always denied that she didn&#39;t know Joan&#39;s Brother infact She had crush on him when he was only 16th 😂 😂😂 &amp; She went there in his concert 2008 n proposed him through banner when he even don&#39;t know who She is 😂😂😂. But she must b appreciated that she climbed 2 that lader by working hard in making her&#39;s dream comes TRUE ❤️. She is such an amazing n inspiration woman ❤️
Ellen came for nick and she was having it…she like don’t come for my husband…
Now i know, kardashian trynna look like indian
Please where do they read cards for people&#39;s future spouse? Cause errrmmmm
Racist Ellen is Lucky Priyanka came on her show
Nick is getting famous in India day by day because of her 😘
Intimate wedding of 200 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She&#39;s really wearing a 💍 on her solitaire* toe too.
Uff how accuarate that card reader prediction was totally shocking
Priyanka Chopra made Jonas brothers famous in India and Nick Jonas made priyanka famous world wide....
200 is like nothing in India. <br>Even halwais are attendees in India.
Thank you for this interview Ellen .Enjoyed the time spent with Pryianka. She is always fun to listen to; never a bored moment. So warm, beautiful and sweet. .❤🔥
Q - national JIJU of India?<br>Ans - Nick Jonas
It&#39;s true not only mainland India but here in Nagaland too which are Christian state of NE India we invite like 3000/2000 peoples and made preparation according to it..... And it&#39;s not like all the invite will show up but even thought they dnt show up they send their gifts and things
Ellen: you did a show five years ago in india, right?<br>Priyanka: <b>hella confused</b> uhm yea<br>Ellen: what was the show?<br>Priyanka: which show did i do in india?<br>Ellen: this one oh my God<br>Are you serious ellen?! She has done so many shows in india, more than what you can think of and you are asking her that she did a show 5 years ago? At least mention which show than to react like oh my God that too annoyingly
Priyanka didn&#39;t fire back good enough. Maybe because Ellen was trying to put her down by lifting nick who, is her husband so she let it pass. It was Nick this time not India or Bollywood.
Not priyanka having more followers than all the Jonas brothers combined
Who&#39;s watching this from which country ????
ellen always tries the ‘you didn’t invite me’ play whenever she can and it always backfires lol
Nick made India popular
India♥️♥️
She is my love/crush , Priyanka mam ❤️ love from india and your heart
Loving natural
How rigid of Ellen :( ....so not open to other cultures.
A lot of westerners seem to think Priyanka was mostly made famous by nick jonas or something (Ellen clearly being no different) but to a significant portion of the East (I’m talking AT LEAST the WHOLE of south Asian and much of Southeast Asia) she was a household name from her Bollywood megastardom. She was like ultra A list celeb like there are only a handful of female actresses at the very top in Bollywood which is the largest film industry (yes it’s even larger than Hollywood) and she was one of them. Technically she’s “more famous” than the most famous Hollywood actresses like Angelina Jolie but they ain’t ready for that conversation.
Fake accent
BesharaM
PC and Jonas Brothers were both famous in their own world, PC in Hindi Language World and Jonas in English Language World. Some people doing arguments that one made another famous. Actually they both made each other famous in their World when they got married.

Smartest girl ever.
She had loved him for a long time
Oh she  is a beautiful lady
Ellen got pricked
SHE&#39;S SO PRETTYYYYY
No he’s not a good looking guy Ellen. He’s a 6! She’s a 9-10. She married down way way down.
Nick married Miss World 2000 dude, he is lucky
They was a caught 😂😂🤣
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
When people say Incredible INDIA<br>My mind: Priyanka Chopra, her wedding and the Viel....
They both are lucky to get each other....<br>Offcourse we are lucky to got a chance to see them (Good &amp; romantic couple 🥰)
Am i the one who feel a bit embarrassing on her accents i mean she can just keep it real.....
Do not mind I am confusing elen man or Women 🤣🤣
If ellen was inI ndia , her rating will be lower than tiktok😂😂
.
Her laugh is so fake
The comments doth protests too much
Indian weddings that last 3 days is by no means intimate
Wha I log phle bhartiyon ko pine bolte h
Priyanka is a good actor in my India. I am proud of you. Good health. And good health yours family. I am prayer God big big superstar
Well she got more attention from their media after marrying their celebrity ,same is true for him.<br>She made the most of it as it was a much bigger industry and dream for her .<br>No other Miss Worlds let alone PC  irrespective of whichever country they are from would have end up this way otherwise.<br>I am not sure if she owns that culture or carry it anymore.<br>Some of the comments surprise me.<br>Aishwarya is on the other hand different and remained grounded to roots.
200 is quite intimate for a South Asian wedding. Moreover both of them are celebrities. Even normal people invite 300-400. How hard is it to acknowledge other cultures. The joke&#39;s on u Ellen. 😂
Ellen is sooooo rude.  What does she mean Priyanka is so lucky to have grabbed him ( Nick Jonas)???? Right from the beginning of the interview, it is sooo obvious that Ellen is colour biased.  Horrible woman.
200 people in india is like the number of people in india who knows the Jonas brothers.
And now they are blessed with a baby ❤️
She is so so beautiful
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=250">4:10</a> was she really priyanka
I just wanted to hit Ellen  <br>when she said Priyanka is lucky enough to grab him. Without Priyanka, he would have never been popular outside US. She&#39;s rich, talented and famous than him
Who is this lady???
Ellen is always rude to outsiders
Priyanka nailed it ✌️
Fake accent 🔥😅
I don&#39;t see the fascination tbh
Ellen is a liar, and Priyanka ( being the intelligent woman she is) called her out, on the whole wedding invite
Who cares whom she married.
देसी मुर्गी विलायती चाल
Ellen should be thanking India for all of these views.
Priyanka: wowza.    Ellen: yea he’s a good looking guy          Priyanka : yea
This is a complete deal marriage where Jonas Bros will get some recognition and priyanka will get citizenship. What u think guys??
She’s one lucky B… Nick is 🔥and has such a beautiful personality. ❤️
Overacting ke paise kato
Nick is so lucky to have her 👫🏻❤️
Man she is beautiful
Afdal A the moonlight Star Lion only one W
Overrated
Ellen ur a bit rough with her and I don&#39;t like it
Well just to be priyanka mem should to be luck to be love so happy so to be have
Fake accent
She always starts with American accent but she fails to continue
Jonas has famous... reason of Priyanka.... Priyanka has miss world... Bollywood hit actress,singer, divas
🤣😂
Anybody from India watching ...Attendance please !!
Ellen is so toxic
the host dressing sense all time wonderful
Okay people quit it. They both are lucky to have each other. PERIOD.
That’s super amazing 🤩 wow
Ellen doesn&#39;t realise that if every Indian chipped in $1 to her, she will become a Billionaire.
I like priyankaa...❤️❤️❤️❤️...cute couple...
🥴
Look at priyanka and then<br>Look at kangana <br>Priyanka is successful actor without controversy,she a good person,intelligent<br>She is an an Indian icon<br><br>Kangana is drama queen
I wish I was rich
Nice
Priyanka
💉🔐🎯
priyanka z overacting...
I wander how can people take seriously such personalities.
I agree Priyanka is intelligent, a great bollywood actress, came from elite background, was miss world.Omg! People need to open their brains  and be know about different cultures, countries. Priyanka  is beautiful, unique. Just an exceptional, woman. Any man will  be proud of her.Nick! is a lucky man.<br><br><br>yanka
Nick Jonas is fortunate to have her actually 😊
She isn&#39;t lucky to grab him ELLEN . They loved each other and Nick proposed her . C&#39;mon
Any one is here after divorce 😅
Her voice is so so nice.
Well... Ellen is behaving like every Indian mother does (how paradoxical) after her &quot;competent&quot; son gets married to a woman who (according to the mother) isn&#39;t so &quot;competent&quot; to marry him.
Salman can never go on The Ellen Show
She is beautiful!!!
In whole bollywood no one can speak like her in English
U don&#39;t know priyanka chopra..helen.... Just come to India..
I am just a wife 😂😂😂
The way she defended her husband thoo 😂💯.. NOOIICCEEEE!!!
We ppl of India dnt know who r jonas brother. Ohk so don&#39;t make look like he is more famous u idiot women.....
фублядьненавижувсехиндусов!
I like  her laugh
God Blessed them 🙏🙏👌🏼👌🏼
That come back from Priyanka though LOL. Well played Priyanka
They should change the title of every interview Ellen does to, &quot;Ellen thinks she&#39;s better and more famous than everybody else&quot;
1 billion Indians and  millions of Asians heard about Nick Jonas after he married The Priyanka Chopra!!
Acknowledgment, Priyanka is Miss World 2000. She’s incredible!
Nick Jonas got the most precious girl<br>He&#39;s so lucky
Lol vidshopped, Priyanka just don&#39;t remember any,cuz she telling the truth,and just try to cover ellen?
Beautiful sweet heart 😘😍😍
Did I Just Hear Family (You Know If You Know) 😉
I am Indian 🇮🇳. I really knows Nick after he became a groom of priyanka chopra. My favorite. Actress😘🤩.
🔥🔥🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=244">4:04</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=288">4:48</a> I realized this pretty late (today) that these is not real but edited. 👏
I really got to know jonas brothers bcoz of priyanka 😛
When you finally get a text from your crush : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=201">3:21</a>
The right way to introduce someone to the society is &quot;Interview&quot;.<br>Someone&#39;s life journey can inspire and encourage others....
Well I didn’t know about Jonas Brothers. But i knew about Priyanka as Miss of the World and a Bollywood star.
We know Jonas brothers just because of Priyanka Chopra...... Meri pyari dur ki behan.... 😘😘😘😘😘
She is such a hardworking Women she inspires many people 👏👏
Maybe Priyanka can teach her friend Meg about family values
Prianka Chopra  made Jonas  brothers  famous In India 🤣🤣
I don’t like the way ellen was talking.. 😒
Did Ellen say &quot;grab&quot; .... Such a Ellen DeGenerate
One year later ... Cmon Ellen ... such a hypocrite..
She is not looking good
I just want to know that who is this person who is going to every interview of Priyanka and writing that she made Jonas brothers famous in India.<br>This personś everywhere!!!!
Is she is a singer i haven&#39;t heard  her name before but sge is beautiful🙂
Actually it’s not only in India, but in Israel, Armenia, Russia, in really lot’s of countries. <br>It‘s not only american type of wedding in the world)
You should drop the accent. It wasn&#39;t there in you tarot clip🙃
Nick is lucky to having pri as his wife
Does indian understand English???
Just saw Priyanka in The Kapil Sharma show. There she was explaining American culture..and here the Indian culture. It is hilarious to watch 😁
Ellen saying priyanka is lucky to get him <br>Dude nick just got MISS WORLD for a wife ..... Seriously who&#39; s more  lucky?? <br><br>Plus she is really smart,brainy , beautiful , works with UN , got an entire bollywood fanbase, sings etc what not !! 😂Atleast you got half good genes for a good kid
PC proud of u
And most specially she&#39;s richer than him
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=189">3:09</a> her expressions 😍😝😘
Yup ..... 1000 people wedding is not big enough for an Indian wedding!
Shes good in English (I mean the way she speaks) omg 😍
Priyanka is perfect in everything
that part of the concert just killed me lol
She is right indian wedding atleast 1000 people would be there...<br>200 is very less actually...
she was so so rude
Great
I don&#39;t know what Ellen trying to do with non westerns she Did the same with BTS this is very normal in the nature of western people but whenever they come to India we welcome them and we will no matter how they behave with us bcoz India believe guest is god this is the culture of india which this idiots will never understand.....
Desi girl Priyanka chopra
❤p🤍r❤i🤍y❤a🤍n❤k🤍a❤c🤍h❤o🤍p❤r🤍a

Any indian bts army are here? 🥰💜💜
Who was that Tarot reader?
National jiju
Don&#39;t feel offended, her show is based on insulting and trolling guest, so it&#39;s kinda normal for her
I’m just now learning that Joe is married lol what…..and Boycott Ellen show
They only see eachother a couple of days a month. That is not a marriage. It&#39;s not even dating. 🤣
Shes beautiful indian girl and nice how she deliver to speak indian
I m an Indian and I grew up watching Jonas bros.
We need to know that common friend, I heard of him/her in each and every interview of them
So proud of priyanka she made her name  even before marrying nick .
Not only priyanka Got a foreigner  husband There are soo many Indians have been married to foreigners as well some ..
Us guy indian girl married
Ellen&#39;s passive aggressive face comes off easily whenever she interviews n Asian.
When you don&#39;t like them,don&#39;t call them for interviews.Problem solved!<br>BTW I don&#39;t know who&#39;s her husband still but he&#39;s lucky bcz she&#39;s a ⭐
Fake accent😂😂😂
From what nick said they met two different ways one said dms and the other said through a friend
Fun fact : All Indians know Nick because of Priyanka Chopra.. Because he is the jiju of our country..😂😂
Nick is now a household name in India. Cudos to PC❣
Ellen is looking younger than before..
Am I the only one who think this is insult .before saying priyanka is lucky think of her status before marrying nick she is not just anyone she is miss world don&#39;t forget that
Everyone saying she should b lucky to have him but I think he should b lucky to have miss world as his wife
Ellen was trying her best to belittle Priyanka, just like she always does. But PC&#39;s replies rendered her speechless! 🤣 🤣 🤣
You bust me on Ellen show!?
Cool Video
She is amazing😘😘
Dress🙄
Really after seeing this video and reading some of the comments about how lucky priyanka is to marry Nick or how she is a gold digger, I feel that many American people need to look outside of their country. Like the world doesn&#39;t only have the Hollywood. I also think that all these gold digger type comments are extremely sexist as honestly priyanka is much much more richer and successful than Nick. So if we go by that philosophy Nick should be the one going after money (chill I know he is not 😉). But it made me extremely angry and also fed into the stereotype that Americans are ignorant of anything outside their country (I dunno if they are or not though).
Love jihad
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Way you dont tich Meghan. To respect her  family ....be her model if you   threw  friend
She&#39;s incredible!! I love her so much 💛
Shes witty and sophisticated at the same time.. ❤️
You know being an Indian <br>When we had &#39;grah pravesh&#39; (home entry puja to a new house) we had almost 1000 people their and I don&#39;t know 70% of them
Pakistani weddings are much better than India 😊😊
Her accent is so fake 😂
LOl 😂
🔥
Sana ol
Nick is lucky to have girl like priyanka, she has 3times more followers than nick 😂...how come ellen says she&#39;s lucky...
I think this is show of extra ordinary child ...es gawar ko waha jane ki kya jarurat tha....
PC is ❤️❤️
Ellen doesn&#39;t like Priyanka Chopra
Well I didn&#39;t know either of them but once in a marriage your both equals, so they are blessed to have each other
Ellen  Nick is lucky to have a Miss world for his wife
Every time I watch this video <br>I feel like two unlikely people who doesn&#39;t like each others are having a conversation and try to have fun
Priyanka is the pride of India <br>And she&#39;s that strong independent self made artist in Bollywood. Nobody 🙅 can shut her up or offend her. Loved PC 🥰😍✨💫
Indian ppl r really serious about love
When I want love I go to the .BANK....WHEN I WANT FAMILY DRAMA I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN.  WHEN I NEED TO BE ROB I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN.. WHEN I LOOKING FOR A MANGER AND BOSS I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN... WHEN I NEED TO SEE A SLY FOX I TAKE A INDIAN WOMEN ...
In my office few staff always check PC in office PC
priyanka chopra is v girlish beautiful and cute
She is very smart.. India Proud of you PC.. most humble kind talented actress in bollywood...
Doesn&#39;t matter how many people we invite<br>Indian wedding r best
Ellen show needed to end
&quot;You are lucky enough to grab him&quot;!! Seriously..?just check their Instagram followers 👁️👁️<br>Who is watching this in July 2021😸
PCJ is the best...love you ❤
This is true indian wedding is like a week of celebration
Ellen supposed to tell audience that whatever pc is here because of Nick hey you she is more popular than Nick you could only check her Instagram and Twitter followers they are much greater than Nick followers 😌
Indian pride ❤️
Royal wedding
As we can see here as well Americans knows nothing, literally nothing
Our jiju is just famous for our Di..... proud of you di.....💜💜
She is very fake like her friend Meghan🤥
just to get insulted she was invited to the show.😜
I am Indian
I still don’t know much about Nick except Priyanka’s husband. Lol<br>More than a billion people now know about Nick and Jonas Brothers just because of Priyanka. Never heard of this band before
C&#39;mon:)) you got lucky to grab him ! 😂😂😂😂 He(Nick) got super super lucky to have a women like her , I mean just look at her she has got real goddess beauty !!
Ellen just doesn’t get how 200 people are extremely intimate for an Indian wedding! 🙄
She already had the fame , looks and smarts before she met Nick.
I think priyenka is already more famous in the world more than nick..coz she is also miss world ND super talented , full of acting skills , also singer as well👏I&#39;m not indian but in indian film industry , priyenka is the number 1 actress who have multiple talent...
Fake
priyanka giving her absolutely nothing by agreeing to almost everything she shows....well that&#39;s amazing..... It’s not easy to intimate girls from indian subcontinent
Sorry, but I also didnt know about this priyanka until she dated Nick. There are so many pretty indian girls and colleagues I&#39;ve known from my workplace and she just happened to be a Miss World.. that&#39;s all 🤷‍♀️ No shades only facts.
95% of Indians know Jonas Brothers only bcs of Priyanka Chopra!
Zero at studies Mrs jones
Meh ...im not a big fan of Priyanka. Her mannerisms and accent are fake and so put-on. She&#39;s constantly trying so hard to appeal to the &quot;Western&quot; audience. But I do like that she called Ellen out on her B.S. if there&#39;s one person who&#39;s even faker its Ellen , so I love it when people clap back at her.
What was she trying to do ? Anhhh acting like Jennifer Lawrence, the fake accent...I can&#39;t listen to it.
Probably because we intend to marry only once in a lifetime mostly, and we do have large families😂😂
04 : 14 in 2008 pc was living her life more better then nick 😒
That lady seems strong and she is glowing. I like it.
She sounds like gal gadot
She is brilliant she achieved great way,, she&#39;s first Indian who married with international success man..<br>She played oozed to be deshi girl and she make  respect and Priyanka followed the words of the &quot;Constitution&quot; of India very well, maintained the relationship of &#39;brother-sister&#39; ( we all Indians are brothers and sisters 😂👍) and she did not marry in India. Proud of you... ❤️
Can we take a moment and appreciate Ellen&#39;s Team for taking snippets from shows and making them hilarious.
2021 me koun koun Dekh Raha hye yeah video 😆😊😍
she coud cover her chest
Anybody recognize the Sansa stark of game of thrones..
rendevous with simi had soo many various ppl
Priyanka is so beautiful, intelligent, stunning, talented and kind hearted. Nick is so lucky to have her
She is so fake...
Prinyanka Dii is amazing... 💞<br>Whenever I see Ellen... Im Jst thinking about Bts... Bts interview she had... Any army here? 💜💜
Danggggg she is so beautiful 😍😍😍
Well the chat section still alive ..??
That&#39;s the problem of all Americans that they considered themselves superior
How many Indians are  watching the Ellen shows
HAHAAHAHA OMG I can&#39;t with those videos HAHAHHAHA
🙏 Namaskar
No one specifically knew nick until they married
Tf, it&#39;s he who got lucky, Priyanka is more famous than any of the people mentioned there
I never knew Nick jonas before he got married to Priyanka, till today I don&#39;t know any of his songs nor do I find him attractive in any way😂 just that he seems to be an ideal husband for her ❤️
You know so ke cool you can still steel
Priyanka forgetting she represents India in the world her dressing is too exposing
That was the moments when peryanka f**ked up ...
Ellen is a bitter person
indian fax
She is absolutely stunning 😍
As she ever talked about her experience in z-girls
She is negative and toxic
Priyanka. hazband wife with beautiful life.
Ellen don&#39;t know that there is the biggest world outside of US<br>😂How can she doesn&#39;t know about the miss world, iconic bollywood actress, UNICEF Goodwill ambassador priyanka .<br>1.3billion indian people today  know Nick Jonas because of her . <br>Nick Jonas get the opportunity here not priyanka
I can’t believe this lady is 38
I&#39;m from Kerala.. Kerala is state of India.. <br>Kerala language: Malayalam (മലയാളം)

Priyanka kundu is not country only global icon plz mind ur language
National jija (brother-in-law) of India- Nick Jonas
Priyanka u r a most talented women ❤😘😘😘
Subjectsaholic
Indian dikhi nhi ki aa gye, bc log,Khalihar.
Ellen is karan johar of hollywood😂😂
Priyanka is acting typical Indian.. we invited you but you didn&#39;t respond though, may be we are not at your label.. blah blah... I mean who says that in some tv program.? ha ha ha.. funny
Tbh, I didn&#39;t knew who Nick Jonas ws, came to.knw him after he married to.Priyanka 💁‍♀️
Indians are not so rich so that they can invite 1000 of people by the way I am from Pakistan
No.1 chapabaz in the world😅😂😂
Gorgeous pc always
I dont like how ellen kept suggesting the point that SHE is lucky to have him
Priyanaka made nick famous in India 😌😍😌😌😌😌
Love from Sri Lanka❤️
❤❤🔥
Priyanka said Ellen didn&#39;t respond, just like Dakota said Ellen didn&#39;t even respond to her invite either. Ellen is a mean woman
❤️❤️❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=78">1:18</a> she  should have also said how can I not invite my watchman&#39;s family
I think, She married Nick Just for being American. LOL 😂
And they will divorce in a few years... Read my words..
Sometimes she says racist things
She got lucky!!!
I started knowing the jonas Brothers when nick jonas is married to pryanka chopra.
The electric corn surgically warn because judo bioinformatically shrug including a daffy staircase. different, poised cardboard
She is from Jamsedpur, Jharkhand😍😍
The fact that Ellen was acting like Priyanka was lying about inviting her. Ellen is so ridiculous. She pulled the same thing with Dakota Johnson. It seems to me Ellen thrives on making her guests uncomfortable.
Her name should be Ellen Degenerate. This is what happens when you don&#39;t realise the power of many. Her total fan following put together will be 1/10th of PCs at best
Priyanka is miss world , and Ellen show her like she is the  lucky one ...c&#39;mon,  you can&#39;t treat her like that..she has achieved so much , and priyanka is top star in india like jonas in USA, so can&#39;t compare there popularity, we know jonas  through priyanka and she is standing there through her hardwork . If she is not that popular, you definitely not invite her in your show,so Ellen you should be respectful to priyanka, she is just not an actor she has achieved so much ..
Love you priyanka
Concert of Nick Jonas where priyanka propose him and facial expression of Nick was so funny.... Like what is happening.... 🤣😀I&#39;m forgetting my lines it&#39;s distracting meeee🤣😀😀👌
It&#39;s funny how Ellen was trying to frame Priyanka but forgot who she is messing with
एलेन लड़का है या लड़की
Ellen always try to act oversmart and  put her guest  in awarkward situation
No knew who was NICK JONAS in India until Priyanka announced their wedding 😀
😂😂😂wao nyc
The ellen show se nam the gandu show rakhdo iska
I have seen a movie&#39; Jumanzi &#39; 2018 <br>And nick Jonas played a short role in that movie .<br>First time I saw him <br>And literally I don&#39;t know Jonas before priyanka &#39;s wedding <br>From India ria
I&#39;m very happy for both of them.<br><br>..from now because of Ellen...love you
Ellen always comes across as that bitter aunt who is passing comments on millennials<br><br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think ellen knows Priyanka&#39;s net worth is much larger than nick&#39;s. Not that it matters (to us anyway), but she seems to think otherwise
&quot;I do need tequila every time I&#39;m here.&quot;
SHE IS SO DARN RIGHT ABT THE NO OF PEOPLE...
Isse achcha hota aap hum Indian se saadi krti
Priyanka is too much woman for Nick. I&#39;m waiting on the babies to really believe she did this out of love
Hi Ellen, Wanna see Aishwarya Rai &amp; Katrina Kaif on your show 🙏
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=324">5:24</a> Priyanka saying she didn&#39;t know much about Jonas Brothers is Meghan Markle saying she didn&#39;t know much about the Royal Family.<br>Come on ladies...
ellen is the best video editor in the galaxy
Ohk who is that card girl I want to meet her 😂😂
Nakli aurat
Our INDIAN BOSSS lady
I just dream see you, ellen  last night. Does it joking.<br>The first time in my life that dream see ellen.
Kitna fake accent nikalegi
Overacting of accent and body language
I think Ellen said &quot;You&#39;re lucky to get him&quot; because she previously said Nick is good person &amp; Priyanka should be lucky to get a good person like Nick.
She is indeed a good actress.
How Many Indians <br>Isn&#39;t Me only ~
those who know jonas bcoz of priyank can like this cmnt !
I didn&#39;t knew jonas brothers until priyanka happen. Nick is so lucky to have her.
I’m not kidding though, Indian weddings last DAYS
1000 - 2000 to choti baat hai indian wedding me to usse bhi jyada log ate hai
Love from bihar
priyanka, God has given you everything, you are the luckiest woman on the earth.
i love prianka
priyanka made johnes brothers famous in India
Fake indian
There are two types of weddings in India<br>1st is more than 500 people (a mass wedding)<br>2nd is only 2 people(groom and bride!){only we Indians know the 2nd type of wedding!}
who thought Pcee would turn out to be a cougar ..
Priyanka made jonas brother famous  in India.. Love you PC..
Marriages in India Last longer than Marriages is USA
Ellen didn’t respond. (?)?
Lol nick jonas wife is actually 10 years older then him
Priyanka is so confident.. love it
i&#39; m algerian and i had 400 people on my wedding and it was super intemate ...ususally there more than 1000
Is she Christian?
In india you don&#39;t marry the daughter,  you marry the whole family. 🤣🤣🤣
Priyanka :I am Just a wife it was hilarious 😅😂🤣
Wowzaa!!
Proud Ellen, uneducated interviewer
Aangrezz oo ko ghodi chadte huye indians ka dil nehi vara... <br>As carryminati says😅😅😅🤣😂
her accent smh
Well priyanka made Jonas Brothers famous in india 😂
Priyanka is so classy and strong. Ellen tried to make fun of her and bully her but Priyanka put her in her place.
Before their marriage, hardly anyone in India knew about Jonas Brothers
dont know wot Ellen thinks herself ! everytime she tries to show Indian ppl low standards with saying we are very lucky ...same thing she said to deepika...nvr underestimates d power of anyone  especially INDIANS ok nahi zaroori smjha hoga tujhe(faltu logo)  bulana agli ne !  lalloo laal khi ki en yeah one last thing ..luv from India 😉
kapil sharma: am i comedy you
PC❤️
Actually nick&#39;s lucky to grab Priyanka Chopra, cuz let&#39;s face reality... she can just carry 10 other stars in her pockets.
I love her
Height of exaggeration!
Fake woman pryinka shopra
Uno reverse card <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=120">2:00</a>
And this proves ellen is mean
Priyanka saying that it&#39;s difficult to zero down to a guest list is so relatable to most indians now😂
Oh Ma gawd, I&#39;m Pakistani so Indians share the same wedding type idk bassicly on every wedding we at least have 3000 people and she only had 200? 😭 What the-
Priyanka seemed much more comfortable here....
nice wedding
Ellen is so racist towards asians like Priangka, bts, superM
He dm’ed me on ‘Twitter’
When you are strong independent woman but you have been side-chik of shahruk Khan to get roles in bollywoodb and flats in mumbai.... went on to use or give favors Jay Sean  to get into music album .. entertained Gerrard butler as stayed in his house few times so that media gets to know who you are.. and then you know lot of opportunist like you and idiots will treat you as a role model.
Ellen is a evil to nice people.
ellen is making her uncomfortable
She’s so beautiful 😭😭
Nick is our &#39;Jamaai Raja&#39; he is son in law of India
Media wale gde murda ukhad lete h 😅..... Kuch bhoolne nhi dete 🤣
Unnecessary things become famous in USA.  99.9 percent don’t do three day marriage in India and that’s definitely not certainly not the reason  longevity of marriages.
You are lucky to grab him... Well... She is way richer than Nick.
Ellen don&#39;t try to diss or underestimate an Indian woman<br>You don&#39;t know what might happen next <br>It is true guys
That&#39;s our desi girl
Something is wrong
Jewellar.
Jewellary.
Plot twist - in Indian marriages gifts they get are less but what they find missing like (plates,glasses and even gifts) is on another level😂😂😂😂
Big fan of Ellen ! But in this video i felt something not right. Like in the end she uttered oh my god!  That was so rude. Obviously she does so many shows !  She might not remember and it&#39;s ok right!
Jonas jijaji
I&#39;m not Indian but I love all the concept and ceremonies in Hindu marriages. ❤️❤️❤️
What are this fellas talking about? Do you mean to say you dont know Jonas Brothers because you are more into bollywood? I think that is the right word. JONAS BROTHERS are so famous like as in. Duh.
Never heard of Priyanka until Nick Jonas married her..😱<br>and I live in India...😀
Fake accent spotted
I am from India but I just know he is his husband , I don&#39;t know what he does
I don&#39;t even know who this is😂😂😂😂😂
what do you mean by she&quot;s got lucky enough to have nick?? that was so sick.
I personally feel like priyanka was the only one to think it was all about what she wanted of starting their relationship because she clearly has no idea of how what she has done of putting thoughts in nick&#39;s head of getting married in the first place it wasn&#39;t necessary for her to be doing that even tell everyone that she might be putting thoughts in his own head of having kids they clearly have some explaining to do of what they want
Wow priyanka in elen show
💜💜💜
Yeah idk what&#39;s up with the comments....?
💖💖💖💖
Lop
Jonas brothers became famous in Indian subcontinent just because of PC 😂
I just Really Admire Prianka&#39;s Confidence , She Fits IN with Everyone and Every Situation. <br>Just like I Do MASHA ALLAH.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=241">4:01</a> don&#39;t mind me, Im just addicted with this part😂😂
We people invite everyone with our heart and it was oblivious of Priyanka to complain about her ignoring the invite like cmon she is just being her indian soul
There are so many people in Hollywood who exude a sunny facade and are the opposite behind closed doors. You can see with absolute certainty in any interview (or just Instagram pic she shares even) with Priyanka that she is made of nothing but goodness. It beams out of her effortlessly like a light
I o0i
I o0i
I o0i
I o0i
Desi girl. Videsi jija🤔
Priyanka fits well in our American society as she is no different from our Afro americans. Seeing her the first time I thought she was from Zambia.
Chops looks so ravishing!!! Go girl!
Who thought it was real video 😂
Touching hair every minutes is just an Indian thing ,.. it doesn&#39;t matters wherever you&#39;re.. Priyanka showed it to the world 😂😂😂
PC proud of INDIA🇮🇳 ❤
People are watching like this :<br>- on bed <br>- not in full-screen <br>- reading comments...😂😂
I m just the wife
‘We were so offended that you didn’t respond to our invite though!’<br><br>Me: Wow...you go girl
When Ellen said bout not having an invitation,Priyanka said she did invite them but she  didn&#39;t respond <br><br>The same thing happened wid Dakota Johnson n when she pointed it out Ellen kinda insulted her.<br>Ellen always does this 🙆🤷
Allen you are so jealous of her
So proud of you Priyanka 💜💜💜
Both the footages are fake priyanka&#39;s face is editing in first and nick&#39;s face is editing in the card
But that footage was fake. It has edited priyanka face
Nick is lucky to marry PC, the miss of world 💓<br>N even nick is lucky get introduce to Indian traditional wedding 😉😘
When Ellen told priyanka “I know nick a little bit, and I know YOU A TINY BIT” I just rolled my eyes 🙄 she kept on taking jabs at her but priyanka stayed composed, quick, and unbothered ❤️
Ellen is too rude
Everyone: quarreling about Ellen behaviour, who&#39;s more lucky Priyanka or Nick?.....<br><br>Meanwhile <br><br>Me: Wow that plant on table is very pretty 💜🤩
Been watching indian weddings for few days now and realizing that indian wedding means inviting a huge crowd. And now wondering how to spill to my fiance and his family that I just want to elope.
Allen: “you got lucky enough to grab him?”  Nick was not even motivated in life before meeting Pri. What the heck Allen?
Seems like Ellen had a huge crush on Nick so she&#39;s trying to make the miss world feel that she&#39;s lucky!!! 😒<br>The thing is nick is lucky af!!
Well in west bengal, India we do invite more than 800 people 😂 in marriage, baby shower, birthday etc ... 😂😂😂😂
So -----cute couple.feel nice ,positive, whenever watch them together. I wish they live together for ever.
Cute nga!!!!!
Ellen is totally mad
and yes, indian weddings are like that
i want to be invited to their wedding hahahahaha
REPENT!JESUS CHRIST IS COMMING SOON JEHOVAH IS THE TRUE NAME OF GOD PSALMS 83:18!
Ellen is so rude... Who&#39;s Ellen🤔
She is not humble at all “show off
Indian wedding means - friends of friends and so on...
Guys they love each other so we really have to compare who’s luckier? They’re both lucky they met someone they love. Let it end with that
I’m just imagining her watching camp rock 2 with nick. 😂introducing me would be perfect 👌
Accting like Selena Gomez
Awesome fantastic job priyanka
Now 2021 video 2 years back 2019 5 years back 2014 but it shows 2011 i found that out thats all
I love her from her show
I just wonder how beautiful she is and her confidence attracts me I want to steal her confidence perfect combo of beauty and brains
Hi👍👍
Looks like her dream has come true they are married now
Priyanka is a star in every respect....she slogged her way up there....Nick or no Nick....she is going great guns
I&#39;m Indonesian who likes Bollywood, I didn&#39;t know who is Nick Jonas or Jonas brother,  I know them from Priyanka
Ellen is the meanest evil human being alive. How’s she surprised she’s not invited to birthdays, parties, weddings. Nobody wants this negative energy
Ellen never respond to any celebrity that invites her
Priyanka Chopra is overactive female.   She thinks herself in front of Ellen as an American. Try your best and you are 100% indian.
Wait, Priyanka has been on Ellen&#39;s?!?!?
I actually went and saw the real tarrot episode😂😂😂😂
The spark in Priyanka&#39;s eyes when she talked about Indian wedding
Who came from tik tok 2020
Ellen look&#39;s like indian karan johar 😂😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So Cool to see her using the American pronunciation instead of shi t t y indian pronunciation! It seems like the audience also like the same!.
Ellen: &quot;...super intimate, just 200 people...&quot;<br>Me: Lady there are 1.3 billion people in our country.
There&#39;s a world out of USA...what do you mean by &#39;lucky to grab him&#39;?
Ellen needs to know that who Priyanka Chopra is PERIOD.
CALL ANANYA PANDEY😂😂😂
Indian weddings are long😐<br> my mother&#39;s cousin&#39;s wedding was 2 days (Nikah,mehandi party) in UAE and 4 days in India we had like mehandi marriage, turmeric party, reception and I travelled for another reception in the groom&#39;s place
Oh my god how lucky is Nick Jonas <br>He married with miss world priyanka chopra
I&#39;m no longer subscriber or Fan of Ellen bcz she dissing our boss lady PC💜🔥 Ellen plz don&#39;t underestimate our Baby girl
1000 people ❤️❤️🔥
Ugh Ellen is rude af here.
Romantic couple pc nick
Nick priyanka jonas beautiful human being
Priyanka Chopra Jonas
We ,1.8 crore viewers, feel offended too, for not being invited.
Ellen sounds so hypocrite!
Well.......Nick jijaji married to an indian actor but never showed off his presence in india and especially in mumbai😭.......
Indian marriages are always royal.
Famous coz of her hardwork only.<br>She needs no introduction❤
Nick is very lucky!
Everthing was ok.until she said &quot;you are lucky enough to grab him&quot;.😩😩😩
Look at Priyanka&#39;s confidence. Indians are blessed with great sense of humor.
Priyanka, the supermodel (Miss World), the movie star, the international TV star and a pop icon! She’s always made Indians proud 🥂
Love how she handles herself despite the attacks.<br><br>True Fact: NEW Bucket List item... Become a car washer for an Indian family in an attempt to someday be invited to their kid&#39;s &quot;small&quot; Indian wedding 20 years from now.
200 is so so less in Indian weddings👰💍🤵💒
😂😂😂😂
PC is pride of India
Fake accent fake personality

This is not anything.<br>Her mother is totally right, we invite everyone we know from our relatives to our nearby shopkeeper, from family to maids, EVERYONE !!!
200 people in a wedding?<br>Like this is not even 1/3 of the people that are normally invited.<br>And to those who think that it is too much -<br>Guys we have 1.3 billion people in our country.
We Indians even invite our relative&#39;s best friend in our marriage.
Pc 😍
The fluffy vinyl conversantly fix because condor minimally slap up a chunky disadvantage. craven, dazzling literature

She can buy jonas side of the wedding. you know.
Very true about Indian weddings!
Lol.. She did put Ellen in the spot! Priyanka can stump show hosts really! U go girl :D
Nick Jiju is awesome 😂🇮🇳
Millennial
Who remembers BTS gets scarred from a fan girl?😍😂

I want to hug Ellen I really love her show
Good
Pc:hey nick<br>Nick:yes mommy<br>Pc:what?<br>Nic:what?
Here from we can be heroes
Priyanka new how to stand her ground with Ellen
Well priyanka Chopra made jonas brothers quite famous in india
Hey everyone just listen up : priyanka and nick are both lucky to have each other.
I&#39;ll come on in Lynn
I like priyanka chopra
Seriously, Ellen says Priyanka is lucky....SHE WAS ONCE MISS WORLD, WORKED IN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY FOR 17 YRS, BECAME HIGHEST PAID ACTRESS OF BOLLYWOOD AND FINALLY AN INTERNATIONAL STAR........all with her own struggle.....I don&#39;t think she is the lucky one
Priyanka &amp; gal gadot sounds the same lol
Try GIN/GENEBRA hhaahhaa
Priyanka is worth a lot more than Nick Jonas and is way more popular. No Ellen whatever can even come close to her popularity!!!
Bumble is india Abu dhabi
You have muslim citizenship freelance
Red means popularity ❤️
I know jonas just because of PC married to him
Atleast ellen did not embarrass priyanka ...
My favorite Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra ❤
The complex tire characteristically pray because star histomorphometrically tremble unlike a painstaking accordion. victorious, elegant condition
Our miss world  is here<br><br>Proud to be indian
She makes Jonas brothers famous in India !!!!good job
ELLEN has no idea of her power in India..so she be like ur lucky to have him..ur wrong lady he&#39;s lucky too have miss world
We didn&#39;t know Jonas before Priyanka
Nick who??? Ohh Priyanka Chopra&#39;s Husband!!!!!!!
The comment section is full of people complaining Ellen put PC down. Come on guyz, lucky hasn&#39;t got anything with importance. It&#39;s just saying, good for you getting a sweet and handsome Guy.
She is 10 yrs older than him!
👍
Nick jonas is good but priyanka chopra is too good in our country
Awesome Honey girl let&#39;s do it , <br>Love You Both immensely !....Cheers👍🏼🥂👍😘💐🙏
Nick texted pc -&quot;we should meet&quot; What straight forward guy
I am getting a feeling that Priyanka might run for US President in future
Jonas be like yes now I am world indian famous
From this video_ we can easily know ellen is Fake .
Aha👃👃👃Job
It&#39;s hard to look at Priyanka&#39;s face 🙂
Cant wait for the her to come back to the show after the divorce
🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=274">4:34</a> which show is it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=188">3:08</a> she coped exactly nick expression oh what an great women she is i love her
When she said Tarot cards, I heard Shahrukh Khan.
I&#39;m not Indian and I don&#39;t know who was Nick until he walked with priyanka at met gala. Before calling her lucky this ignorent Ellen should check Priyanka&#39;s achievements and her success.
Her accent 😍
<b>forced laugh</b>
Having 2000 or 4000 people&#39;s in  Indian wedding are common😹
My friend Allen
I still can&#39;t swallow the fact that priyanka chopra married Nick Jonas. More suprised on her part. In a good way
I love how Ellen n title of the video all is tryna make priyanka look awkward. But it&#39;s great to see how her lovers from across the world are backing her up.
Here ,<br> A guy had 1200 guests in wedding and 4200 guests in devorce<br>😂
Ellen only likes white people. She&#39;s totally different when Jennifer Aniston is on her show.
Child marriage is not permitted in india..
They just generalize and talk about 1000 guests,  practically it doesn&#39;t happen, a middle class family I can say around 300 to 400 max people for sure. Entirely depends on how much influence you have in society.
🥰
India is great country in the world
She&#39;s trying to show what she doesn&#39;t have😂🤣😂<br><br>Guess what ?
priyanka  chOOpra!
What show is she in ?
They way say wife it was far more heart touching
Mad Ellen <br>PC is best
She&#39;s sooo obnoxious and full of herself.
Anyone here from India like me😁😉
Indian girls NEEDED to be texted first<br>Very fine example
I reckon he is the lucky one. She is the star of bollywood.
Is that tarot card thing real?!
How come she doesn&#39;t have indian accent 🤔
if you are wondering how the wedding can last 3 days like indian. I give an example of kazakh wedding: we invite about 1000 people, the wedding lasts for 2-3 days including pre-wedding ceremonies 😂 it is asian thing calm down
She is hard working and working hard with different NGO to spread awareness and happiness
She started her carrer as Miss World
One thing is clear .. ❤️ yet there are beauties  who fall for Handsome guys. expect money lovers
I love Priyanka !! from india ♥️♥️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=23">0:23</a> chakhna kidhar hai bc 😂
Who is here in 2021
Priyanka boasts up more
I love her accident
I love Ellen very much ❤ <br>I wish can meet her once in my life 😊
Her mom&#39;s jeweller:
Sity sutting city citizenship
u are freely fee      male   s now genera genorsiry
When Priyanka Chopra won the miss universe when Nick was just 9 <br>😂😂😂😂😂Looooooolll
Priyanka and Depika super hot🥰😍
L .
Fake accent
Like throughout whole show Ellen was like Priyanka u&#39;re soo lucky to have Nick but man, literally it&#39;s the opposite. Priyanka is much more successful than Nick nd also she&#39;s miss world 2000 ( tho in relationship that doesn&#39;t matters nd both are lucky to have each other) but someone needed to give the reality check to Ellen!
America :32crore <br>India :1.32billion I think he know that&#39;s

Ellen a jealous hag
God I’m Indian and I didn’t know about the wedding customs. Just 3 days, a really small guest list ( just 200) 😂😂
1% people see this message your parents live more then 100 year❤
So Priyanka Married One Of Frankie Jonas Brothers ? Wow ✨
Fake accent.
Nobody will ever respect a liar and boaster!
What is this with Indians?? They always love to boast ....
Pc is a hypocrite
She pretends to be them but she didn&#39;t
I am proud because she is from India
I love her, because she is the best!
You can&#39;t found beauty like Indian&#39;s,  arab&#39;s beauty
Did Priyanka really sent the invitation to Ellen or she was lieing to maket her go speechless??
Ellen should be carefull bcz if priyanka want her indian fans alone can crash ellen&#39;s social networking sites with insult
&quot;I do need tequila everytime I&#39;m here.....&quot;
She is so hot
Ellen always tries to call out someone for not inviting her but it always backfires
Ellen being Ellen whole video trying her best to embarrass Priyanka
The real question for indians is where were you all looking ....
Check my channel i have made a video on Priyanka Chopra if u liked it Do Subscribe 😇💫🔝
she so fake 😒
reminds me of Borat trying to speak English...great success!!
WOWZA !!!!♥️😌
She is the succesful Miss World Winner
Ellen is so rude.😑
The soft woolen therapeutically cheer because africa longitudinally prepare toward a reminiscent crowd. burly, honorable grass
😂😂😂😂
Hindu wedding bolne me saram a raha hai kya?
It&#39;s very obvious that not Priyanka buy Nick is the person who is very lucky coz he got married to the queen !!! Miss World 2000
This is so embarrassing 😍😂
Ye dress carry kaise krleti h pc 🙄 i cannot even imagine 😂😂
Nick was lucky to have the miss world. Did&#39;nt you hear? He dmed pc for a date. Moreover, in love both partners are equal
Ellen definitely brought out the tequila to see if she was pregnant, like she did with Maria Carey
Ellen you gotta try something else. Step up your game honey. It&#39;s not easy to fight back an indian women 😂😂😂😂😂
Dear Ellen 200 people come to our wedding without invitation.

Priyanaka choprede pari
The poster : nick will u marry me<br><br>Nick :yes
James corden is way more respectful than Ellen
I don&#39;t like the way Ellen talks..🖕
Guys I am shocked to know that it was 3 days ! <br>Well y&#39;all, even the most basic indian wedding rituals last for 5 days , which is the standard. PC did it short .
Don&#39;t end up like her. IF YOUR INDIAN STAY WITH INDIANS!
No one:<br><b>Indians referring to Nick as jiju</b>
I am seeing this program for improving my English speaking skills 😂
No wonder Ellen accused of being toxic.Nick Jonas is lucky one,he get to be married to miss world.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=250">4:10</a> is false edited video, it is not true. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=289">4:49</a> is edited card as well.
Someone in the comment section - pc is famous all bcoz of Nick and  she was just lucky enough to get him <br><br>Me - Ellen is this is ur 2nd account! 🤭
Priyanka is my fvrt fvrt actress from Don , she is very talented and after her wedding i know nick <br><br>She is awesome <br><br>She knows very well how to handle situation 😍
Serious nick is the lucky one marrying the MISS WORLD
She is so artificial
Very smart and intelligent girl.<br>She is real mis world
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=317">5:17</a><br>Bruh!<br>She is so jealous of her and completely roasted with the fire of hatred from inside 😂🙄😌😆😠😟🤔🤭
The pleasant timpani superiorly man because attraction lovely box plus a female fertile lock. mammoth, abhorrent tiger

Priyanka is talented 🇮🇳
Ellen - &quot;Super intimate just 200 people &quot; <br>That made me laugh so hard 😂😂
Tarot cards reading.. I&#39;m very strongly believe in Tarot 🙏❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=89">1:29</a>: The woman in the blue dress. This is your future Nick. A indian Auntie when you are 40. Its only 12 years . Good luck :D

Was she only insulted because she is an Indian or a brown girl?
Ellen knocked out by Priyanka with that comment.... I was offended for him actually but what do I know I&#39;m just the wife. BAM!
Whoever mocked Priyanka for her too american accent in quantico... People, please notice that she is completely using Indian accent here. In an American series, one needs to pronounce English the way their people understand. The same way Katrina&#39;s hindi accent was important for Bollywood movies. I really adore Priyanka the way she ignored the vast criticism she used to get and went all the way to make her own mark globally.
Ur a lier Ellen,u aren&#39;t as polite as u appear,u hiddenly address the pissing topics for the comers!!come-on do u think we people r mad or something to not notice that bitchiness in u!!!🙄🤨🧐
Priyanka is super  smart.
Middle East Asian weddings be like 😌💅🏽✨
She inspired me a lot 🥰
I feel priyanka is afraid of something I feel see fear behind her smile
The most powerful women of India .🔥🔥🔥🔥
My wedding had 7000 guests , the milk for one of the sweets alone came in four tankers 😂😂😂no one does weddings like us indians 🙌🙌🙌
Nick:  jiju of india
I cant even with that fake accent
She’s so beautiful
She spent crores for only 200 people. We spent like 60 lacks and fed like 5000 people.
Ellen is just ignorant..🙄
e <br>w
She strikes one as a dominatrix
She looks really beautiful and strong 🤩🤩
Salutes to priyanka for the way she takes those questions and smiles on it. I wish someone clever n witty was there for her to answer such mocking questions. Lots of love &amp; strength to PC.
Shahrukh khan please Ellen
She should have went: Is this Villa One?
Ellen is like priyanka has been done a favor to, for marrying Nick. I think she&#39;s more attractive and awe inspiring than nick. Nick has got much more than what he deserves. He had been dating dumb popstars until recently. And priyanka is extremely intelligent. Only thing I don&#39;t like about her is, she is way too animated, moves too much. Very distracting.
ELLEN IS A JEALOUS JUSTIN BIEBER JR.
ELLEN LOOKS LIKE JUSTIN BIEBER JR. 😆😆😆
When i saw jumanji n saw nick i was like he is kinda cute but I came to know about him only when priyanka got engaged
Ellen literally tries to represent non westerners as low standards.. she did it with Priyanka, BTS and many more
We are proud........🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂😎
I&#39;m Arab in our countries 22 Bollywood more famous than Hollywood
yes i am an indian and i have been a  jonas brothers fan since camp rock &lt;3
Priyanka looks boring...trying to show she fits there lol
Open your eyes in the last days ..For What is the deal if you gain the whole world but stil lose your own soul 💯💤wake up⚠️REPENT ❗......
She is sooo beautiful that skin color on her ❤️😍
Nick&#39;s so lucky to grab her!!
🦚🦚🦚🦚🦚🦚🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰💐💐🌹🌻🌻🌻🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿💞💞💞💞💞💞💞🌿
just like aliens movies, Allen also thinks USA=Globe !
Ellen you are the best😁😁😁
Priyanka is amazing. ❣️
ugliest lady of the world priyanka, not lady not man
She is really very hard working and charming personality. Respect P.C❤️🙏
For my brother&#39;s wedding there were nearly 6000+ guests
“You are lucky enough to grab him” bruh!! I am not Indian but i got little offended to be honest. Dude was in elementary school when Priyanka was wearing crown for miss world!! Lol 😂. Anyways they both are happy with each other and we should be happy for them. They both are lucky to have each other as an husband and wife.
Elken has no idea  who she is . She was on cover on time magazine and unicef embasador before she met the guy . More successful ,more richer,more fans and now she made nick jonas famous .he got pulled out from the grave.
whatever shoib malik is still indian&#39;s favorite jiju 😂
Indian weddings are full of enjoyment with dance🤟, food😋 and happiness ❤️
I can say one thing.... Abt Nick he is loyal coz he is my brother I don&#39;t know when he changed his name
Both are lucky....
Malayali puliya da....💪
Im from East Africa and Never know The Jonas Brothers until Jonas get married to PC...But i always knew PC..
Is that tarot card real?
I love Pri because she worked hard to get to where she is now, and not relying on Nick&#39;s empire. Everyone says that she is using Nick for the money and fame, but really I think that she probably has more money than Nick, and she worked hard for everything she has. She really deserves everything that she has now.
things us indians do to get a green card, how desperste she is
Fact is priyanka is more famous than nick
Luv ya, Priyanka ur amazing...
I never thought Nick Jonas was going to be a part of India, never
PC is using her both hands all the time 😲😯😮. Anyway,I like her.
I love the way by she is questioning.👍❤️🔥🙏
I came to know about Jonas after priyanka married him
The host is somewhat insulting Priyanka especially in the end, you are lucky to have grabbed him. This is ridiculous. They like each other. They got married. What is the grabbing stuff
Ellen Degeneres is &quot;self made&quot; &amp; sometimes she&#39;s forgetting to look back where she came from making her mean in doing all her celebrity interviews. She has to maintain being in a&quot;low profile&quot; putting her guests in an embarassing &amp; confused situation. She needs a good, healthy flow of conversation mentally &amp; emotionally to make her show more joyful, enjoyable, normal &amp; an entertaining experience, okay Ellen? Thanks!
My dr&#39;s last name is Chopra &amp; I don&#39;t know if she was Indian or not. She was only filling-in for my regular dr on the phone but she was very nice, smart &amp; sharp &amp; upbeat. It&#39;s Jonas who&#39;s so lucky to marry her for her beauty, brilliant talent, success &amp; popularity &amp; everything to name a few. I wish the couple &quot;all the best&quot; &amp; find eternal peace, love &amp; happiness! God bless them together!
priyanka
Asthma Patient
Ellen does not realise how many people are jealous of Nick and hating on him become he is married to Priyanka, or maybe she realises but just brushes it away.
How the hack she is miss world.
Ellen need to learn to treat foreigners
HINDUSTHAN me lrke kya mr gye the<br> PUCHTA HAI BHARAT
Priyanka talking about how Ellen didn’t respond to the invitation, reminded me of Dakota.
ram ranch
I haven&#39;t heard Nick Jonas&#39;s name before their marriage , man this Ellen is freaking uneducated and am so sick of her.
Isn’t Priyanka Chopra GenX though?
Horoscope ....nailed it ...gosh
Deep down, Ellen was not kinda comfortable with the fact Nick married her.
Ellen says &quot; You&#39;re just lucky enough to grab him&quot; seriously??? Ellen is such a mean person....
In half of the part Priyanka was just showing off 🙄🙄
In our indian weddings 1000 guests is like only 200 😂
In Indian wedding our Uncles<br>Work as a waiter😂😂😂
For my wedding it&#39;s just 1500 people 😎😂
I usually talk like priyanka,  but lose my accent for some difficult words lol..
Indeed Priyanka Aunty is the Lucky one to grab the nationality of US...Remember they are epicenter of the world well developed advanced and on the otherhand India is still developing
Bollywood ke kele khate khate angres kele khane chale gayi apne bachche ke umar kr ladke se shadi kari bhuddi
ellen tried to roast her and got roasted back loll
Awesome priyanka
Ellen has a way of explaining everything...😍💖<br>Congratulations to Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas...TRUE LOVE.
Ellen tried eveytime to prove she was, gold digger an humiliated her but she gave every answer with so much fun ❤ love u priyanka ❤
&quot;Lucky enough to grab him &quot; Ellen has idea what she is saying. Priyanka is wayyyyyy beyond his league. Look at her dating history the guys she has dated in the past are not even close to him. Nick was really lucky to grab her!
I never thought: those women are so lucky, they married these handsome Men. I always thought: holy moly those Boys married such beautiful Women!
Nick is lucky af to grab her <br>don&#39;t forget who she is.....<br>PC we love You😍💕
I loved how pc speak the truth, ellen is really rude in real life!
Indian weddings are dope asf, and I’m mexican 😂
How many indians are here
They married in Jodhpur...<br><br><br><br><br><br>That&#39;s where I live!!!!
Look her accent... totally looking she is trying to copy them
I&#39;m experiencing severe second hand embarrassment for India on watching this.
How fun lol her wedding seems like it must have been so fun
Ellen is a degenerate...so boring
Priyanka Chopra ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️she is so talented 😍☺️
Ellen is very judgemental.
Who else think it&#39;s amazing show rise hand ?
I was shock that there were only 200 people. I thought atleast 500 people attended the wedding
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=246">4:06</a>
Priyanka is lucky to have nick jonas
Im the only one who is distracted by  .....😂
Wait a second......last she said that Priyanka is lucky to grab Nick I mean really Nick Jonas is not famous worldwide like Justin Bieber I don&#39;t know Nick before their marriage.
Ğpea<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Awzw<br>Ben sana <br>....&quot;?..&quot;?
Well...i m from india....and in the lockdown we have our sister&#39;s marriage...and 50 guests were allowed from both sides due to ....but guests arrived are nearly 70...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣....but we tried a lot to invite less guests.....
Queen❤️
Priyanka Married Nick.<br>Plot Twist :  Priyanka adopted Nick...
Both are famous in their own world, I never knew about Prianka, till she got marry with Jonas, Jonas is so famous in all America.America doesn’t know about Bollywood and those things so I am happy to know her culture . Greetings from Bolivia 🇧🇴
Fun fact : All Indians know Nick because of Priyanka Chopra.. Because he is the jiju of our country..😂😂
My wedding is 1000 people...that is true..
we have more than 200 people for birthdays
Ouch ellen u did it again. You were invited and u lied to camera. PC and dakota dont play baby
Jitne log priynka mam ki shadi me aaye the,  utne toh hamare yaha naraj hue baithate hai... 😂🇮🇳
She reminds me of Drew Berrymore
She so pretty 🔥
Ellen DeGeneres is the mean person in Hollywood
I’m Pakistani and the weddings last 7 days with like 5000 people
and because of this sweet lil honey called Covid... We Indians haven&#39;t still figured out how to marry without  inviting our wedding guests :(
India&#39;s proud of you PC
Hahahaha  she trolled  priyanka especially that indian show   hahahaha<br>As an indian it feels so funny and still so embrassing  oh god im dyingg!!!
Gg. Bzizs.
🐊🐋.🦃🕊
I am watching Hollywood movies since childhood but I never knew Jonas, on the other hand Priyanka wore the crown of Miss World, she was a big celebrity by herself, she has done movies like Barfi and Fashion, she didn&#39;t grab him, they both deserve each other. And 1000 people is nothing in an Indian wedding, my parents got married in 1990 and they invited 600 people. That is very common India. Ellen has no idea how big celebrity Priyanka is.
Oh Corona just made it  only 100 all around the marriages...else it is India or wherever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=247">4:07</a> the footage doesn&#39;t looks real. If u notice the angle and the background.
I LOVE YOU
It does not feel like Ellen likes her
Marriage is festival in india
My fav show Quantico
Ellen seems so ignorant on how big Priyanka is. Nick Jonas known as Jonas Brothers &amp; that&#39;s all. Oh God... Most people around the world knew who Priyanka way more than who is Nick Jonas.
Not all way some time’s yes and some time’s no  yah  lol  I been honest and my turn life now    Tall you more tonight is because how  it is to me   I may make on time  not make tall 5
&quot;You are lucky to  grab him&quot;<br>Oh please , check Priyanka&#39;s achievement first , I think Nick is lucky he got miss world.
Priyanka ,you wore dirty dress , shameless girl,
Shopie really like Queen
This makes so much sense now ..Ellen didn&#39;t respond to their wedding invite....
Are people forgetting that Priyanka is a BIG thing? She’s India’s love and she made it to Hollywood HERSELF so nick is also lucky to get her.
At my wedding there were 1500 people which was less as per indian standards 😀
I grew up *watching the Jonas brothers and Priyanka&#39;s someone I&#39;ve always looked up to as the boss lady she is. So I was really happy for Nick. He&#39;s really lucky.
Wow Ellen is telling PC she&#39;s lucky to grab Nick? I think after dating and dumping every well known female celeb in tinseltown Nick will say he&#39;s lucky to have Priyanka!
She is right 200 is actually less man 🤪<br><br>Im from bangladesh and my family is not so rich but still we have 3000 or 4000 people  in our weddings 🤣🤣🤣<br>And the wedding lasts for 6 days or 1 week atleast  if they r muslim and fir hindus its longer. And plus there are functions post wedding tooo 😆😆<br><br>And i wish the same too i want all my relatives, friends  to be there for me.. ❤😭
Even non indian ppls are against her grabing statment ànd still she is in so arrogance
Proud to be an Indian I mean she is an indian and make india proud these two actresses deepika and priyanka make India feel proud love you guys
I am surpise when a white guys married to an east Indian women, i didn&#39;t know that easy Indian people can married outside the race
Woww beautiful lady...beautiful
Is it just me or Ellen DeGeneres Ma’am is totally trying to belittle her..
Yo Ellen when I hit my puberty we invited 300 people for that function and it was just a limited people only from my mother&#39;s side
I liked Ellen ..Not anymore
She&#39;s so hot
💚
tell me about a huge family i can relate to that so much!
When she says  &quot;Indian Wedding&quot; and you realize there goes her fake accent out of line
Priyanka jada style mat mar🤫
I almost thought she married bangbros
She fails to talk like an American
Did you see how she lied at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSE3F7KT68&amp;t=265">4:25</a> about &#39;knowing the show&#39; just for the moment and then recovered from it!!
Well,she might be lucky but he is luckier. You should know the kind of well deserved status Priyanka has in India.
Me 3000 lol😂😂
Comments = 4.9k<br>Likes on comments = 12 k
Tarot cards = shahrukh khan
I think the video of priyanka waving with board and nick jonas picture on card are morphed.they are not real<br>I didnt knew Ellen was fake
Super intimate, just 200 members 😂🤣
Super intimate 200🤣🤣🤣🤣
We sometimes even attend weddings of strangers just to have fun
200 is like the neighbors only
Priyanka have such a charm that she can get anything <br>So we can&#39;t say she is lucky
She should have adopted him as a son
300 is minimum for middle class indian and 100 gm gold is minimum given to daughter or girl of house along with necessary utilities .In short ,dad spends his big part of savings on his daughter one day marriage ..
She’s so cute 😭❤️ she reminds me of a toddler
My elder brother wedding was small 800 people but 1000 people because all happened in 7 days of planning because brother was in india for 15 days
Shiv Sena might had kidnapped her or made mirzapur 2 if she had been to India. Good decision Ellen.
For those who are saying they had 1k guests , 2k guests , we are 1.35 Billion people i just wanna say its not a proud thing.
I think the average guests in India are like 2k-3k
I came to know about Nick jonas after PC dated him...
I married a gorgeous Indian man. I am deeply private and only wanted 30 people there. He couldn&#39;t believe it 🙈 he was so shocked that we were even going for less than 300 people (which is very small for them). We settled on 140, he still goes on about how small it was.
For them.. 200 is very limited. They coulda probably had 4000 guests ffs.
We gotta admit she&#39;s the most Successful Indian Celebrity
She&#39;s pride of India 🇮🇳
Most of the people in India know Jonas brothers due to PC. He&#39;s just an average boy next door type. Many Bollywood male actors are more handsome and educated than him.
Nick is that hot????? Okay then.
Opens up about the wedding. <br>She only said how many people there were. <br><br>Sooouuhh clickbaity
I like how Ellen tried calling her out for not inviting her to the wedding but it totally backfired. Hahaha!
I am from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳 and when I watching this video <br>I think about BTS 💜💜 💜
I love Ellen! ❤️❤️
Iam from Chennai for my sister&#39;s wedding 5500 people came
When I was in college and I want a feast then we get dressed and went whole group for a single invite...
Ellen is being not nice to Priyanka Chopra. Now her real personality is showing off. Here she looked so condesending and down right insulting. She always complain about not being invited but in reality she does see any invites (same as Dakota Johnson).
Hi
