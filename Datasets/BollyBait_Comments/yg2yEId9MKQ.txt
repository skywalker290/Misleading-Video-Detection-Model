Born in Denmark, only word she can say in Danish is &quot;Skål&quot;, that makes me proud.
I love Deepika ❤❤❤

She is just too perfect.......
i love how scripted this whole thing is!
Mmm Audrey Hepburn as favorite fashion icon is not cliche at all! She was exceptionally gorgeous and confident who paved way for plethora of artists who are serious about fashion and glamour. She was ahead of her curve who took on different experiments and kept her sartorial elegance moving. Her signature look in Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s made waves and after almost 6 decades it&#39;s still talked about and appreciated just like it was back in the day. She is a freaking icon who inspired generations to come so nope, not cliche.
I hate her, I don&#39;t know why but everything about her seems so self absorbed.
So Beautiful, Charming,Loving &amp; Magical ! Love you Infinitely Deepika !💜🤎🌟✨
Shes my favorite indian actress ❤
She is very happy
❤❤

Charsi, Drugaddict, antinationlist Deepika
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow, I don&#39;t know how they managed to come up with such boring answers inspite of the whole thing being scripted.
Most contrived interview ever. In India it is so common for celebrities to be fake and cringe.But I did not think she would be like that for an American interview.
videography looks like a VR<br>INSANE!!!
Let&#39;s normalise having an accent ok? Deepika do not have an accent which is totally fine . DO NOT COMMENT AND MAKE THE PEOPLE INSECURE ABOUT HAVING AN ACCENT MFS.
😄
Very classy
🩸💉💸🚦💃🎭bollywood🌎🥃💨🚦💃💸🩸💉
she is unpretentious ,natural and down to earth india actress ever! unlike many &quot;foreign&quot; actress who try to make out in Hollywood try to fake an American accent or erase their identities and past, deepika is just so comfortable natural and proud to be Indian !
Panic
Shut up there are people suffering and you are floating your fame and fortune
I was starting to wonder there&#39;s no way there&#39;s a house that looks like this here in India then they said New York.

She loves Princess Diana and me too❣️❣️

Nice video
She is looking gorgeous with long hairs
Can y’all stop with the ✌️Indian accent✌️ u will be surprised that not all Indians have the so called Indian accent. Everyone in my class had a different accent depending on how they learned English or which language they spoke and sometimes their accent was influenced by where they stayed /who thought them English/whether they were abroad <a href="http://etc.so/">etc.So</a> stop with this Indian accent ,it’s stereotypical.Not all Indians have it ,saying as a Indian myself.And stop shaming other Indians for not having ur so called Indian accent .It’s completely normal for everyone to have different accents .It’s not pretending or faking…. And I even read someone saying having an Indian accent is a part of our culture and love for our country…..like come on y’all can do better <br>(Don’t mind the grammar mistakes ,I’m still learning)
Her english accent is like nawazuddin siddique english🤣🤣

Why does she look so stressed. Even though she is an actress in India, she cannot do this very scripted interview, relaxed.
honestly, I found her bit annoying. Not a bit actually.
Princess Diana  we miss u 😭😭😭
She looks kindss
What do you like in India - food <br>What will you do in Mumbai - eat <br>What will you do with Diana - eat <br>😂 True Mumbai chaat lover there.
I honestly love her so much she’s such an icon

Deepika padukone is very kind and beautiful
She is sooo humble
I fell down the sofa when she started dancing 😂 I didn&#39;t expect that bcos she is a good dancer ❤️
Why is she brings half Glass of water 🙄🙄
sooooo scripted
How calmly she said &quot;Guns&quot;
Love you Deepika!!!!🥰❤❤❤
Deepika in NY city !!!!
I love being emotional
Loving people are enemies with selfish people. The emotion of selfishness should be punished. The emotion of love should be legal.
She changed her skin color and her favorite color is white.
Her happiness looks so scripted and presenting to camera
Deepika is so naturally gorgeous with one of the best figures, best authentic accent, great down to earth personality and she has the best bum and legs in Bollywood.  What a beauty and talent! Love her
Ek din kabhi jo kud ko tarashe meri naraz Tu zara..
Not a fan ! But really loved how down to earth she is... As  I have watched many of the 73 questions  and found many of the celebrities are kinda mean
If you have watched every 73 questions videos then you can definately understand how humble and hospitable Indians actually are......after watching this one....love you Deepika
Yeah sure tons of similarities between mumbai and newyork🙄
Her Indian accent is so good.
Harry Styles would never be able to do it this quick
世界一可愛い！！
Why&#39;s she constantly smiling
Fake..who cares for these stupid celebs
I don’t get comments like ‘only actress to speak in indian accent’ like bruh india is a frickin country with a million languages there are bound to be different types of accents while speaking. Stop stereotyping that this is the only kind or the original Indian accent
She is druggist now it&#39;s 2k22
Want 73 questions asked to 73 qs guy🤷🏻‍♀️
How cute she is!!<br>deepee🥰🔥
I love how she isn’t awkward like Kylie Jenner (NO HATE TO KYLIE JENNER I LOVE HER TOO)
Deepika STUNS in Padmaavat omg

Queen 👑
The way she intervien to offer him a glass of Water shows how Indian she is ❤️
It seems like she already knew those 75 questions
Why can’t my fellow Indians get over this ‘accent’ crap?
She’s one of the meanest Indian actresses I’ve ever seen. Super mean in person.
Nice
She sounds super dumb- no education
I wish they didn’t script these because that would be so much more fun
Offering water in India is culture
People giving compliments here about the accent should do a bit of introspect about their present lives 😅😅
Deepika is so tall she could be a runway model

Serving water is customary in India to all the guests(known or unknown).<br>I am glad to see she&#39;s carrying our Indian culture and traditions outside.
Blossing 😂👌
Hiya!
I am just amazed by the amount of water she put in the glass, less wastage🥺🤧
Please do ask 73 questions with@Anne Marie
I am yet to see a Hollywood celebrity offer this guy something to eat/drink. 😏

Leonardo DiCaprio is superb..💙💜
Deepika looks cute..I like the way she speaks..<br>People say that Deepika has whitened body but Deepika looks not here like that. Deepika looks natural..<br>And little bit Dusky here.<br>This skin tone looks so beautiful on her.
Watch 73 questions with priyanka chopra.. Her answer n confidence 🔥🔥🔥
How much faking she is
I love how her smile lightens the mood of everyone
Question 74- D, what&#39;s the best drugs money can buy?

I wish that when I spoke English it came out in an Indian accent<br>at school, I usually speak in English and when I do talk in Hindi people are surprised that I even know it<br>like wth😂<br>who can relate?
🥰
Love this❤!

Padmavati is literally the best movie ever!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She&#39;s generous 🙂😜
All are scripted
Why she is so black ?
love her❤🥰
Drugi overacting
Can you do a 73 questions with the guy who films these??
She&#39;s the only one to offer atleast water to the interviewer ❤️ this is Indian culture
(Hypothetically) And if princess Diana visits India, She won&#39;t eat with you or try to hang out... Instead she would feed others. That&#39;s what she is. (You can&#39;t say the poverty thing. Coz Indians will be mad at you.)
Where is Feminism currently in India?<br>Deepika (In her head) : &quot;🥴😆🤦‍♀️.&quot;
This was fun to watch ❤️❤️❤️ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23deepika">#Deepika</a>
I love how she talks in Indian English accent
She looks so cute , so natural...and now she looks so operated...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2yEId9MKQ&amp;t=421">7:01</a> did she say any Mariah Carey song?  Or is it my ear

she&#39;s literally the sweetest with the one who is interviewing her!! I mean I watched kylie and others being arrogant for no reason while Deepika being the sweetest ☺️
The way she asked if she could get him something 😍 True Indian ❤

I love the part where she says can I offer you something? Other celebrities don&#39;t say that
M so proud of depika she is loving and not proud of herself
The fact that coming to this after Kardashian and Jenner 73 questions with Vogue 😊😊😊

I dont like her.. she is totally fake..
She&#39;s the most insecure and boring actress of Bollywood . She&#39;s so fake always, try to be innocent in front of camera 🎥
👩🏻<br>🧥
Ok soo for the people who says that how nicely she offered him water is basically the most important part of indian culture, people in here will great u with soo many things as we believe that the one who comes in our house is god (even approx 100 years before those who were having nothing just a glass of water used to offer it to the one who came to our house no matter how much we want it ) and I like how she respect it and doesn&#39;t fake her accent ❣️
https://youtu.be/ZaewAQkx0_I
She doesn&#39;t make sense
Her eyes looks she is high
Next millie bobby brown plz
Is this staged or its a normal interview <br>Yah I know it&#39;s a dump question but please reply
Mridusmita Bora
Amazing
She is❤❤
BORING
looks like deepika lovveessssss fooodddddd<br>i love her soo much one of my fav actors
Ok I think the fact that now she is in Hollywood, so due to the excitement she is acting soo over 🥴🥴🥴...
Her eyes looks humble and kind...
I think as an actress she could have looked in the camera more..
I just love the way she said emojii ......😌♥️✨
Charas kidhar hai bhai
https://youtu.be/cIr8-jsjFWU
shes so beautiful
She can&#39;t be this fast.. in all her interviews she drags and drags to answer for a question...here she is super quick and to the point.. guess she was already given these questions 👍😂
Others:she&#39;s really cool....🤩😲<br>Me:Counting the number of questions to check whether there are 73 questions...😅😏<br><br>No hate💜
Can&#39;t believe she is talking in hindi accent oww lovely❤
I don&#39;t get why Indians care so much about accent. Some people just naturally develop it when they live in a foreign country, and some people don&#39;t! Your accent will vary depending on who you speak to and how often you do. So can we please stop comparing people and saying &quot;she&#39;s not faking her accent&quot; or &quot;priyanka fakes her accent&quot;? Thank you.
I want 73 questions on modiji. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23vogue">#vogue</a>
They so have to be not themselves in hollywood like yea I have to show I am cool. They are not this way in Indian interviews. Both Priyanka and Her seem to be trying so hard to look coozy and friendly with him. Honest thought not hate
druggy earlier i used to love her but now i just hate her to the core
I want vogue to interview Carryminati 🥂😂
Is this deepika&#39;s own house?
This is so incredibly cringeworthy...she speaks so poorly.
इ मात्सून है bebiya जन्म जात मात्सून है वैसे ये भी brain wash कर दे trust जीत के
Maal h kya 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder who filmed this video.
She&#39;s so tall..
Was she asked any Q on drugs...
Out of everyone interviewed, she was the nicest and spoke with class.
☆We to guests:Tons of formality and foods<br>☆Riches to guests:Offers 1/4 glass of water
i went to mubai
Food is very important in India ...<br>Deepika is such an angel she looks so gorgeous T_T
she is really giving the good vibes wih that smiles ❤️
Man this guy has the luckiest job

Her legs  🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️
Cute doll
Does not she have better dress to wear in that hot bod, poor choice of clothes. Looking like as if she is in a business meeting.
I would love to speak with her at real life☺️☺️☺️
The best part is that all the pride of India like Priyanka , Deepika offer the speaker something! <br>That is India! We respect everyone!
I am curious to know who is this guy who takes the interview?????🤨
my fav actress in Bollywood
Can u do this with &#39;shraddha kapoor&#39; . Please 🙏
Water?🤧
There must be drugs everywhere in this apartment ...
The worst person I&#39;ve ever seen ✖️✖️
I love Deepika she is soo down to earth she is just soo honest 💕💕💕

💜

When she started flossing LMAO
The good thing is she didn&#39;t fake her accent
The jolly attempt roughly entertain because burglar metrically increase times a half page. second, charming revolve
She&#39;s cute 😘
Pani ke saath thoda ganja bhi offer kar deti ji<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>U know what I am saying! 🤣
Is she talking about the same ABC kitchen which was insulted by Gordon Ramsey on kitchen nightmares?
I mean she answered so fast
Pretty...clear answeres
love everything about you
Do 73 Questions with the 73 Questions guy!!
Stop saying she doesn&#39;t have a fake accent. Everyone has their right to speak in any accent they want!
Turns out she is addicted to drugs. And was willing to coverup a likely murder of a fellow actor, so theor common drug-peddler trails would not lead to her. Well, they did.  She is no role model.
indians and their obsession with people who speak indian accent!
Deepika padkoun very beauty queen
People watching this like:<br>- in bed<br>- not in a full screen<br>- reading comments
My grandma was amazed at her height
Gorgeous
The beauty, The confidence, The Deepika Padukone Aura💕
She&#39;s so hot and sweet
Hate It
Pudukone beautiful girl is answering very well of that man&#39;s 73Questions vogue 👍👍👍🎉🎉🎉
Such Fake personality these ppl are!
Indians are Indians but nothing is impossible
Bollywood + flossing = blossing<br>-Deepika 2019
one edition with harry styles please ! ❤️
She has attitude or not ?
The blushing manx unintentionally wreck because cheese wailly regret underneath a delirious geranium. new, unequal persian
Here after her Levis ad :)
Interviewer :- Where feminism is currently in India? <br>Deepike :- it&#39;s in a great place, but still has a long way to go. <br>(This hit me so bad) <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2yEId9MKQ&amp;t=385">6:25</a>
She is my most fav bollywood actress.
She truly has achieved a lot
Drug addict shameless
Good luck Michael looks awesome!! That ending was epic  kon kon dak hit like  [ VICE  ] Like kon kon करेगा 🙏<br><br>👇<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpt77sW5Tl7vTrZKg0wqouQ">https://youtube.com/channel/UCpt77sW5Tl7vTrZKg0wqouQ</a>
THAT RING THO
Indians are naturally hospitable
Deepika just answer his questions 🥴she can&#39;t take English to far😂sorry to  say that😝
Sad Priyanka noises in fake  accent
اهه ياربي تجنن وطريقة نطقها وشكلها💔.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2yEId9MKQ&amp;t=52">0:52</a> and corrupt
Priyanka Chopra ✔<br>Deepika Padukone ✔ <br>--- <br>who&#39;s next on the list of Bollywood actresses on vogue 73 questions? 😉<br><br>I would love to see Ileana D&#39;Cruz tho. Just don&#39;t ask. It&#39;s my opinion. lol
Nyc❤️❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2yEId9MKQ&amp;t=74">1:14</a>
Best friends
What makes it special with number 73? Why not you go till 100 questions?
HER DOING THE FLOSS IS EVERYTHINGGG-
Deepika is always adorable and fabulous in her all the interviews..she answers really great!!!<br> &amp; why 73 questions only? why the number 73...i am curious about...
Cocaine😂
the most fake and scripted 73 till noe
We need 73 q&#39;s with the 73 q&#39;s guy
I think that&#39;s her voice not accent. Idk why people&#39; would try to make fun of PC Jonas accent here. I mean that woman has got an accent coach since she got to act in American TV series. And earlier before her entry into pageant she has to be coached into that  pure Hindi accent. I think Indians are just being Indians by gossiping and hating on other people. Like they do amongst their family &amp; friends. Like the Sas bahu serial they show
Her voice and her charming and kind look<br>👆🏻<br>This is what I noticed at the first sight of her in this video<br><br>She didn’t fake her accent or anything else <br>👆🏻<br>This is something I felt when the video started
Guide for Princess Diana 😍❤️ to India ❤️
I turned on the CC on the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2yEId9MKQ&amp;t=209">3:29</a> when Joe said Deepika it showed Typical.
Woahh she can speak about 6 languages 😲❤😍
Deepika was born in Denmark?
I LOVEEEEE HER DANCING OMG
Maal hai kya?
So sweet
I really wanna know who this guy is 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_cAIOZgUM4">https://youtu.be/P_cAIOZgUM4</a>
So this bollywood people agree india is full of culture then why they are destroying &amp; insulting indian culture through there films  hypocrites 💩
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KXhWmpI5nE">https://youtu.be/-KXhWmpI5nE</a>
Hi Good morning, Vazir .M.
Nashedi,  Ganjedi
Wish I could take or just assis joe at interviews. Its the best job 😍
She&#39;s so delightful
she is the best
And she is so much quicker in answering just as the questions being asked rapidly.. not even a single answer requires little time to think.. I think she would have really good IQ or would have known what could be asked !  🙄
Deepika is the best
Who thought that deepika was pregnant in the thumbnail picture
The unable bun inadvertently love because bestseller equally name till a purring dolphin. judicious, absorbed interest
The wiggly crocus geographically slow because explanation coincidingly borrow sans a dispensable basketball. robust, romantic teller
Her dance was hilarious
All &quot;friends lovers &quot; when she said CENTRAL PARK<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>CENTRAL PERKKK
Her dress is so pretty and she looks stunning💜💙
Y is this women so beautiful her features are just perfect. She is even so humble💜
Hindi bol Lo😂😂😂😂
Two types of comment that are driving me crazy<br>Firstly she might be a drug addict but that doesn&#39;t mean that you discredit her for all the efforts she puts in...for her dedication and talent...and tbh ..many of the artist are drug or alcohol addicted ...so why&#39;s that a problem when a &#39;woman&#39; does that...so hypocratic...and I&#39;m not supporting drugs but don&#39;t focus on just one trait... there&#39;s a lot to see and appreciate in this Lady...she literally brought in a whole new revolution in bollywood.<br><br>And secondly ...what you call fake accent should not be a problem to you....ppl often change their accents so that they&#39;re comfortable and not because they&#39;re ashamed of their indian accent...if an American comes to India... he&#39;ll try to slow down his pace of speech and say the words more clearly so that we&#39;re able to understand him better... similarly when we go to a foreign country we&#39;ll try to adapt to the foreign accent so that ppl around you&#39;re comfortable with your accent...so that they&#39;re able to understand what you speak...so judging or hating or even criticising someone for their fake accent is very stereotypical and immature.
That place is incredible. Is it her hotel apartment ? <br>Who knows. Its probably a luxury hotel. At seventy five thousand dollars a night, but it comes with a seven course meal breakfast,  lunch and dinner.
She is very decent and a real elegant 🌹
She&#39;s the most pretentious and fake actress of bollywood .
Who sold you drugs 😂?

Ok someone please clarify ... when she said princess diana did she mean Gol Gadot... the person who played wonder woman ?
Who do you think is better <br>Priyanka:Like<br>Deepika:Comment
Please dont drag her drug scandal into this. She didnt even consume drugs. It was those media houses crying for TRP. She&#39;s been given a clean chit by NCB. And besides, she was just called for questioning.

Artificial reactions though she stuck to indian English accent.
She is not taking with accent 😂😂
Mostly sane 😁

&quot;Can I offer you something?&quot; : Sure some drugs ; Hash not weed.
Arey charsi😂🖕
Druggie 😡 deshdarohi
Now she has nothing to say takes our money to  procure drugs for herself and her husband 😠😠😠😠
Lots of people are commenting upon her drugs intake as such they have never heard about any actor&#39;s or actresses drug case. <br>Man it is quite normal for them
For those who keep saying drug case, please stop. Realize this, that half of Mumbai would be in jail if they started to arrest for weed. You could go get it like you&#39;d get a chocolate in the supermarket. There is nothing wrong in it
. This woman is fake,  she always acts innocent in front of the camera but inside she&#39;s so jealous and insecure of her competitors.and her fans are also same like her . No wonder the comment section is full with her insecure fans who are trying to put down priyanka .and this Depression Queen became druggie now. ..
Most hated woman in india did what not to make her look like as if she&#39;s a big thing in Bollywood loved the way she got exposed druggie
She is a criminal now. She got caught in a drug scandal and is a druggie. Police are behind her
He should&#39;ve asked &quot;Mal hai kya ???&quot; Instead 😂
Joe ask her how did she got arrested in drugs Mafia 😜😜
Druggist ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
She’s sooooo beautiful 🥰 and look how she treated him 😍
What a fake show-off. Watching and realizing this after her being caught for the drug case.
Maal hai kya
High quality maal mila hoga vahan
Ahhh depika💖💖
Bhai ko maal do isko, aur haan, haish dena, gaanja nahi 😏😏
She is a big druggie. Remove such ppl.

If one sees any of her original interviews , she does not speak half as fast as she speaks here . I think she may be a slow thinker 🤭 if that&#39;s a thing . I mean it&#39;s VOGUE !!!! She may have byhearted all the answers it seems .
I counted 75 question , i might be wrong! 🤣
I want Vogue to interview Arnab Gosawmi🤣
make her a Fortnite character
Deepika 👎
She literally tried to do a head stand with a glass of water in her hand😆😆😆😆😆
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2yEId9MKQ&amp;t=117">1:57</a> it&#39;s definitely  not the same 😂
Dumb, boring.
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2yEId9MKQ&amp;t=459">7:39</a></b> that&#39;s what she said

Omg she&#39;s so fake i saw her in so many indian interviews and she&#39;s definitely not as nice as she is in this interview
I  admire  her  for  offering  something  to  interviewer.but  I  think  she  should  offer  a  coffee  or  juice  instead  of  water.offering  water  to  guests is   very  rare  in india.

Bollywood passed away while Sushant Singh Rajput became immortal. Our hearts bleed for SSR! India lost a national treasure. A legend &amp; an exceptional human being in every single way 😢😢 Boycott Bollywood in every single way....it’s trash and not something worth aspiring to. The cover has been blown off of Bachchan’s, Kapoors,  Khans, Padukone, Shetty &amp; others in the Bollywood Cesspool. Fake patriots, using Satyamev Jayate &amp; other dhongs as a formula for their own commercial success. Shameless vultures!!! Disgraceful! Not one word for  Sushant Singh Rajput, who was viciously murdered?!!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottbollywood">#BoycottBollywood</a>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justice4ssr">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cbiforssr">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23globalprayers4ssr">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a>
