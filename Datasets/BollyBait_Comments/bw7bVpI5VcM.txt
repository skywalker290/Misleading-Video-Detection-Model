Dont Ever Let Your PAST To blackmail your PRESENT To Build A Beautiful FUTURE❤<br>    -SRK<br>MY FAV LINE... ❤❤❤
Not everyone would understand this movie.... But ppl who know would know.... They would know...
This song is very helpful again start life......just thinking never loss nothing ❤❤ beautiful future can understand your life and enjoy with smile 😊😊
Every one leave me but then I realized that the world is same with out them so i should love my self❤❤😇
Started taking Alua Bhatt seriously after watching her enact in this movie the role of a abused and lost girl! This alongwith Raazi was the best that gave her career a turn, I presume and she is one among the best that the new genre has ever produced...Kudos to the entire team of this movie 🍿🍿🍿....one of the best movies of SRK watched after the likes of Swades and My name is Khan etc ..Great movie...loved it to the core❤❤❤❤
Happiest song ever composed and I have never seen SRK act as versatile a character as this one. Literally got into the skin of a clinical and we&#39;ll experienced, the best psychologist and therapist in town! Nothing nothing more endearing than this!! Love you Shah Rukh my favourite actor and one of the few crushes in Bollywood 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love u zindegi🎉

This song and the movie has really helped me alot to come out of the depression I have been throughout 2023. I learnt how to love myself and love my life again. Thank you Dr.Jug
My dog had died on 1st October 2020. I was so helpless and broken at that point of time because he was with me for 14years. I lost my only best friend on that day. This song was the only therapy that helped and aided me, it helped me to recover through the loss that was occurred. I still listen to this song and sometimes I miss my dog so much!! but Alas! this is life and everybody has a time limit for staying alive. I miss you so much wherever you are you will be my only best friend. 🐕❤‍🩹
Sana Arora&#39;s version of this song is far better than the original. ❤❤❤❤
এই গানটা আপনার জন্য, আমার ভালোবাসার পক্ষ থেকে।। ❤❤❤❤আমি আপনাাকে ভালোবাসি এটা আপনার সামনে বলতে পারবো না কেননা আপনার সামনে আমি ঠিকভাবে কথা বলতে পারি না।
Sukr hai jindgi na milegi dubara😊

গানটা যখন রিলিজ হয় তখন আমি  তেমন একটা হিন্দি বুঝতাম না কিন্তু এখন বুঝি,, আর যখনই মন খারাপ থাকে তখনই গানটি শুনি❤❤❤
मस्तच!मुक्तपणे बागडणे!हसत खेळत आनंदी जगणे,सकारात्मक ऊर्जा!❤
Love you meri garibi zindegi  ❤😂
I was a schizophrenic patient.. I had so much anger issues.. Self harming thoughts..<br>Anxiety Attacks <br>Because of some childhood trauma but after 1.5 years of suffering I am cheerful 😊<br>Thanks to Clonazepam
I sometimes become like this..and i enjoy it.
Jab bhi mai demotivate feel krti hu tb mai ye song sunti hu and I feel better
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw7bVpI5VcM&amp;t=187">3:07</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw7bVpI5VcM&amp;t=191">3:11</a> is such a nice candid moment between the two actors. Feels like this wasn’t scripted and that it was perhaps a BTS/Blooper which was so nice that they used it in the final edit.
❤😢
I have my own channel if you like you can watch <br><br>Anyone can give meaning of this full song like <br><br>1st line in hindhi line in English <br>2nd line in English <br><br>Thanks in Advance
Mera comment Viral kar do plz😢😢

In this song I think that if you don’t love your own life you didn’t achieve any goal also if you don’t forget your bad past you never remember your good future

SRK AND ALIA BHATT kono ega wa kirei desu
Highly motivational song!
I watched this movie back in 2016, but now I can feel this movie and song!! 🙂🙂
SRK&#39;s screen presence is something else man ❤
You look like a skibidi  camera
On tomorrow my best friend in college ditched me  .from then I feel so disturbed anf disappointed..but I always belive in God that whatever he does with us that will good for us ..so besides all the problems just enjoy and chilling with this song. Because life will not take back again ..
Very lovely Charrecter of Srk🥰
I am cry love you zindagi
Always felt like i am alone and there is no one I could  count on when i am in need but after watching this movie and while I am listening to this song I came to a life changing realisation that I have to stop relying on other people to find me when I am low instead I should just go and ask for help straight away. Everyone has something going on in their lives and I should never be s burden to them. Also if you are broke and don’t have money to spend on therapists , listening to songs like these and talking to someone  helps trust me.
Wow
found it, took me months to get up from procrastination to search for this gold...
Love you Zindagi ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song really makes me happy and unstressed. This song goes to my past and makes me happy and emotional 💖 💕<br><br><br>Love you Zindagi !!! !

Alia is truly talented ❤
Every time I feel low I just come here to listen this song ❤️
I love this song 😅
Wow Alia Bhatt your the best at dancing
I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for more than 6 years. I don&#39;t what t do but this song gives turn over give me the strength to move on from the past. It gives me a positive vibe in my life and helps me see the outside world openly. We can&#39;t change the past but I learned to change into a better person in life. This song gives me the strength to move on. I want to be happy and independent and I want to enjoy my life fullest. The pain I went through was huge. But pain changes to scar it&#39;s healing. I  know how to love myself without a love partner. There is no one in the world going to stop me...ever.💕❤️
Today I did the most right thing that was to overcome my fears, anxieties and decided to let go off my past and this time decided to do it with all my heart and let go off everything that makes me sad and hopefully i will get through this. Listening to this song for some positive vibes. ✅
This song can help to throw depression and it make bright and happy life

Sometimes you love someone truly madly and deeply so pure and genuine but they fail to understand. If someone new comes into thier lives they find excuses to get away from you. They listen to others and gather hate for you and then they distance themselves from you in most hurtful ways... This song is dedicated to them.
I love my life love u zindagi ❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😊😊😊😊 i am so happy ❤❤❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 thanku universe for beautiful life ❤❤❤

Also don&#39;t take anti depression medication. They worsen the problem.
There was a time, suicide was  first choice for every set back, failure and failed love.😡<br>Now I laugh on those foolish thoughts.😂😂😂<br>Life is not over friends.<br>Picture abhi baaki hai 👍
Don&#39;t think about suicide 😡<br>Things changes after few months or 1-2 years. Be patient.<br>Problems are part of life.<br>Will be there till death.👍👍
Movie for depression-<br>JAB WE MET<br>(watched 100-200 times)<br><br>Best of luck everyone 👍👍
3 songs for depression<br>&quot;Bikhri bikhri si julfen hai kyon&quot;- MP3 full version<br>&quot;Chak de India&quot; - title song<br>&quot; tumhi ho bandhu sakha tumhi&quot;<br>(I tried 10-11 years back)<br>Hope they help you 👍👍

I travelled from hyderabad to Goa in bus 🚍 hearing this movie songs in loop ➿ to commit suicide.... One phone call in beach 🏖 from dear ones prevented me doing it.... Now I was held captive by my own parents from the past 18 months confined to bedroom and hall. Battling depression from the past 12 years...... Hard part of this human life was BEING GOOD to your own ABUSERS of life. I had to treat and look after my own parents chronic diabetes and blood pressure, bronchitis etc who house arrested me from the past 18 months. My mom accuse me of little change in her watery stools because of the ayurvedic medications I give her but the actual fact was she was taking allopathic medicine on empty stomach which was the Main cause of watery stool. Had to message her feet when she had a burning 🔥 sensation in her feet with ayurvedic oils again she accuse me that she got diabetes because of me...... It&#39;s uncontrollable pain.  I wish one day I would had enough courage to run away from my home 🏡 and see beautiful stars ✨ above my head up in the sky with fresh breeze of oxygen filled air which was odourless..... My last wish was to eat one full plate 🍽 chicken 🐔 🍗 Biryani... God help me
Chahiye to alia bhatt<br>Jawan
