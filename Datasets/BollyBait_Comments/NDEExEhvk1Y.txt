Why does Bollywood use so much make up to make their film characters look Caucasian....<br>&#39;What an acute case of white Superiority Syndrome&#39;

Bullshit movie
Who came here after watching padmavati trailer ??
Congratulations! Indians are the best film makers of bull shit. Snajay Leela Bhansali indeed is the best director and cinematography is excellent, acting by all the actors is par excellence. Hey, but hold on the story line is nothing but something that should have stirred the sentiments of India in a very big way. I cannot believe that this film was big money churner. I will walk out of the movie to see Bajirao, demeaning his country, his commitments and┬аhis duties
So much respect for ranveer singh....no god father evn though he has bcom bolyy superstar and beaten so many khan respectively by his perfomance..he got best actor award foe this movie beating dilwale of srk
Still one of my favourite trailer..better thn padmavatiЁЯСМЁЯП╜ЁЯСНЁЯП╝
Love bajirao he has vision of building Hindu Kingdom after chatrapathi shivaji maharaj.... <br>Nobel peshwa 1 bajirao.... <br>Jai ho.....

Actually Ranver and Deepika lived a true love story in this film
maharashtrian kings and North East ahom kings were best fighters conqueers in history who had given tough times to moughals..but our kings used to f8ght wars involving heart and rage..moughals won as they had highly skilled archers..and they never used to fight in wide 200 mtrs fronts rather used to fight in narrow passege the only Goldman strategy made them to win over us
excited
Deepika Padukone looking bold and beautiful
Sanjay was Art Director....so he knows how to build a beautiful set. N I have trust in his name. Bollywood always try to make natural shoots except required. 
deeepika wow
Can&#39;t wait for the magnus opus directors&#39; magnum opus. RanDeepYanka combo looking on point on every level. ;)
epic,action,adventures 
Terrific..  <br>Can&#39;t wait until movie release <br>So excited <br>Love you Ranveer Singh <br>Uuumahhhh
I think that is going to be a box office.can&#39;t wait to watch it:D
The Great Maratha and Great MAstani
This trailer is also awesome and the movie will be one of Bhansali&#39;s best works ever.<br>Please don&#39;t compare this film with Baahubali. It would be very stupid. People criticize Baahubali as most of its work is done by graphics and vfx. Then can u pls tell me which indian movie did u see that used this kind of technology at such an extent(there are Krrish 3 and ra.one). It is made on Hollywood standard and people rather than appreciating that fact are criticizing it. Did u notice the weapons, warsuits and other small things. Probably such an effort has been put in no other movie. Plus, Baahubali is India&#39;s highest grosser worldwide. In USA and China, it broke the records of Pk and hny. It is not a khan movie then what takes a movie in achieving so much. Both these films will be epic in their own way.
I am impressed with the scale of production and the production values but the last bit of dialogue had me groaning..... that is so &#39;inspired&#39; by the famous line from Mughal-e-Azam, &quot;Ishq Jo dar jaye, who ishq nahin, ayiyashi haiin&quot;
Does anyone know the song/score for the trailer??<br>.. So epic!
nice
What was I doing till now!!! <br>Omg Epic It is ! Can&#39;t wait at all<br>Bajirao-Mastani-Kashi ЁЯТЮ
The larger than life as usual ...... Sanjay Leela Bhansali... ЁЯСН you rocked it man..! Its music ,coustumes, sets, chemistry b/w actors simply INCREDIBLE...! Sure i m gonna watch ittttt...... ЁЯШЙ
deepika &lt;3
This will be a hit just like Ram-Leela. My most awaited movie.
most awaited film from such a long duration.i love slb movies.its nice historical movie.
fab click
Glorious Part Of India !!! <br>Shreemant Bajirao Peshwa 
Deepika looks beautiful and majestic, Priyanka looks elegant and poised and Ranveer looks every bit a king....looking forward to the movie
Mr. Bhansali is hands down the best director in the entire Bollywood. He had plans on this film even before Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (one of my favourites from him). He wanted to star a couple who has never been on screen before, and was only ever starred on his films. Starting from Aish and Salman Khan to Aish and Shah Rukh Khan and now the beautiful duo: Deepika and Ranvir. This has high chances of being his best movie ever (if you can imagine a movie being any better than Devdas haha). I can count from one hand how many Hindi words I know, but Devdas and Ram-Leela are among my top 5 favourite films of all time (including Hollywood ones)! I can&#39;t wait, literally can&#39;t, to see the amount of soul put into each frame of this film, and ofcourse the outstanding performance of the talented Ranvir, Deepika and Priyanka! Wohoo
I love that accent by Ranveer тЭд 
Wow it looks better than whole salman khan&#39;s films
I love treiler
Hope my state government in Maharashtra will declare it Tax free before it release. So all maharashtian can watch this Epic. 
Breathtakingly beautiful.
M sure , It&#39;s Gonna be super part of colloquy ┬а:- &quot;Baabu Rau ne mastaani se mohabaat ki hai Aayiyaashi nahi&quot; :-)
i love ranveer singh
And even for Priyanka Chopra in this promo she looks hot stunning and cute in a Maharashtran avatar all i can say she is very good in this character as the Kashibai the role of Ranveer Singh &#39;s first wife in this film and Deepika Padukone is just playing the role of his second wife as a warrior. Thank you Mr <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sanjayleelabhansali">#SanjayLeelaBhansali</a> for this awesome teaser and the entire team of Eros Now for producing it. Congratulations for the promo and all the best the whole team of Bajirao Mastani. Im will definitely looking forward to this film and also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bajiraomastani">#BajiraoMastani</a> will clash with Shahrukh Khan and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rohitshetty">#RohitShetty</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dilwale">#Dilwale</a> on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%2318dec">#18Dec</a>.

Super excited for this! Deepika and Ranveer will create history again with their mind blowing chemistry after Ram Leela. DeepVeer forever!
They honestly chose the BEST actors for this movie. Ranveer obviously looks great; Priyanka and Deepika have their expressions. Down. PAT. Cannot WAIT to see this film with my Hubby :)
priyanka just nailed it as kashibai....one of the greatest actresses in bollywood....i juz love her &lt;3
okkkkk i think i will be satisfied after watching the film
A Magnificient Historic Film In Bollywood After Years
this movie is superhit.
nice trailer
For those who didnt understand the small things captured in the trailer.<br><br>So the movie is based off of a real story between Bajiraw Peshwa and Mastani. its an epic a few 100s of years old. The stunts you saw were what they did back then to kill the commander who used to ride on an elephant. kings used to cut their thumbs and bleed to take a pledge to protect or as a part of their crowning ceremony. the nod that priyanka does is a common gesture in maharashtrian culture to express, &quot;you are looking good&quot;. The Mughal vs Maratha battles are a huge part of indian history which is not really explored very well.
Will surpass Jodha Akbar Easily!! Looking forward to it<br>Ranveer Singh sounds great  though with his dialogue at the end.<br>Nice. Bye!
This is Grand!
Nice trailer &amp; Deepika too....:)
The great Maratha
Priyanka Chopra is truely the Best actress of this generation She can actually play all kinds of roles n live her characters to the fullest.Absolutely love her.
The last scene in the teaser is an epic one... Peshwa Bajirao with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23danpatta">#danpatta</a>
I will watch this in theater..:);)
I like!!!
Stupendous, exciting and excellent trailer.... Hope the movie is promising as equal to promising trailer....
The Great BAJIRAO 1 (aka thorley bajirao)..<br>Fought in over 41 battles and is one of the few to have never lost a single battle...

Bahubali Classic??? my foot. BM IS GONNA ROCK 
this is going to be the best movie i have ever seen
Is that a true story ?<br>OMG Deepika its the best actress female .... She can make you feel the role with her .... She is unique :) :) 
Woow
This movie isnt going to have a good ending since its a bhansali movie 
This will be really great initiative by SL Bhansali. Bajirao first was really unsung hero and ignored. I hope this will be next mega super-duper hit of Bollywood.
ЁЯШН

Peshwa BAJI RAO 1 is called napoleon of India...I sometimes wonder Baji Rao was born before Napoleon....so can&#39;t I call Napoleon Baji Rao of France????????....My only request is don&#39;t make his story just for romance...not lots of Indians love their own history but if you really wanna Salute to him..then make a really damn good movies about how quick and great we&#39;re his campaigns and how passionate in reality was!!!People love to read lots of thing...but if you wanna really learn about our great warriors..statesmen..even AmarChitra Comics are fab...40 RS EACH My dad bought me all the comics costing around 11K RS when I was in 8th grade...and even now after being 18 years old and now going to one of the top NITs of India this very year I still love to read about the leaders...! I am gonna watch this movie in short I meant :P<br>Regards
Relly tooo good.... &quot;Bajirao mastani se mahabaat kiya aiyashin nahin&quot;ufff wht a dialogue. .
Well I feel more proud to see my culture shown so amazing On a grand scale in this movie and ofcourse every girl looks d most beautifull in the maharashtrian look.

i like the trailer waiting for film............
that background song is getting on my mind
Ranveer &amp; deepika ki chemistry to owsom hai I like that .....I can&#39;t wait this movie ###;**
I cannot wait to watch this movie to see...<br>I have high expectancy.
Magical...Powerful...Marvellous, SLB at its best &lt;3 Looking forward to it Deepika , Ranveer look awesome but the cherry on the cake is Priyanka how adorable she looks as Kashi bai :* Peshwin Bai &lt;3 yaar damn excited 
good background score
Love the star cast and director. But the trailer could have been better. Its like gift wrapping a diamond when its not necessary.  Hope it doesnt go flop due to high expectation of all after the trailer.
Wow excellent work of Mr. Bhansali. Looks like all the wait was worth it he has Indias best actors in the movie who actually can act and how. Ranveer wow this guy always suprises me with his looks he really fits in to the character of Bajirao. Priyanka and Deepika are so beautiful. The best things are left out and thats the chemistry between the three leads. Bhansali has a wonderful way of presenting the visuals in his movies so perfectly without any technics and I am happy that the war aspects are also shoot so realisticly. People for claiming the end scene where Ranveer jumps is to OTT thats not really right. Actually Kalaripayattu was back then used by the warriors so its possible with the way he jumps. I hope this movie has a similar success like Baahubali because those movies deserve every money for their input in the industry.
eagerly waiting!!
sure will make 300cr
Awaiting for more videos of Bajirao Mastani, loved the teaser.
Priyanka looks fabulous in marathi look ...тЩетЩе
Don&#39;t have any words to describe the feeling. Speechless. It is MARVELOUS, MAJESTIC, MAGICAL. Mindblowing
Likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
Im way too excited ...December is tooooo far ЁЯШУЁЯШУЁЯШУ
I&#39;m definitely going to watch this!!! who else ??
Wooooooooow Nice film
Hope that film will be as good as trailer! For now, a huge thumbs up!! Excellent work!
Please dont compare Bahubali and BM both r different but rather similar in presenting our culture....we r lucky enough to witness this movies.....great going both teams
superb!
Extremely like deepika and ranveer jodi..chemistry is like aag aur samundar..both r superb .. i say its a must watch movie in first day first show..
Priyanka looks algent I am weating for this movie
The GREAT MARATHA! Marvellous..<br>Manacha mujra..ЁЯЩЖЁЯСПЁЯСП
The Lion Of Maratha
Wow. Some great treat to eyes with the glorious peep into history of the greatest civilisation of world. I&#39;m definitely watching this at first. Ranbir is so natural with looks and acting. Interesting to see would be the clash in cats. Deepika or Priyanka. Go girls. 
nice
GRANDIOSE! That&#39;s the only word I can use to truly describe this trailer. And if the trailer itself is so magnificent, we can only imagine how EPIC the final product will be. Till then, this trailer makes all recently released trailers bite the dust: Fan, Raees, Sultan, Brothers, et al. Can&#39;t wait!!!
Bajirao Mastani - magnum opus awaited with baited breath
Ranveer fits  perfect as the great Bajirao...  Awesome trailer...
Simply Marvelous
BAJIRAO PESHWA, the Great Maratha Sovereign Ruler who perpetuated the legacy of the Greatest Shivaji Maharaj for the establishment of HINDAVI SWARAJA by DESTROYING the MUSLIM Imperialism from INDIA.... under BAJIRAO PESHWA the MARATHA Empire rose to be the largest HINDU empire in the history of HINDUSTAN that covered the most of the INDIAN SUBCONTINENT, the MARATHA EMPIRE replaced the nefarious MUGHAL empire and our frontiers, religion and culture were protected and excelled. The great Warriors can also be great Romance makers and BAJIRAO-MASTANI is the epitome of the same..
This movie will be a epic in Ranveer singh career i guess... Looks Awesome...
excited to watch this film...
Hope it will release shortly
Cant wait for that picture
Wow!! Just wow!
Bajirao ne mastani se mohabbat ki hai, ayyashi nahie! Looks good
Superb trailer...it must be superb na...bcoze itz Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#39;s film....Last but not the least Bajirao nd Mastani, my favri8 couples Ranveer nd Deepika
this is gng to be sumthng EPIC!,
Awesome trailer..Eagerly awaiting the release!<br>A truthful &amp; Epic love story of the Great Maratha General - Bajirao Peshwa!!!
Big screen masterpiece !!!!! Love SLB
It must have been a great experience to see this trailer on theatres..
It looks like a good movie and should have good response as content based films are getting good responses especially ones portraying Indian History and Culture,good example is Bahubali which has broken all records of the Khans.Though personally i am not that much fans of the Marathas as History shows after Shivaji many Marathas sorted to loot and plunder areas outside Maharashtra particularly Bengal 1741-1751 where they created mayhem looting,killing,raping which was ultimately stopped by the murder of Bhashkar Pandit and treaty of Maratahs with Nawab Alivardy.

Hrithik would be best suited to bajirao character 
How come bajirao is flying in air 2.50..like a rohit shetty movie 
what an outstanding teaser! cant wait for this one to come out<br>RS is just killin it man and PC looks graceful<br>Deepika looks so beautiful..hope the movie turns out as good as this teaser!<br>SLB is at it again..great work
I genuinely feel we could have had a better Bajirao...he was said to have a majestic and killer appearance...especially he was fairer and had hazel/blue eyes...the bajirao cast in the old serial on etv marathi-Shrimant Bajirao Peshwe was perfect!
Trailer is awesome.....Ranveer Singh is not luking good in the movie......he seems to be not suited for serious roles and epic movies like this......the movie would have been worth watching and a super hit if the male lead actor was someone like Hrithik......Priyanka and Deepika are luking good and I am sure they have done a great job in their roles......will watch......
Ram leela wasn&#39;t that ┬аgood, I hope this one is.

Sword he is using is called dandpatta in marathi if have seen asoka you can see it there too actually curved swords were brought by arabs and moughals imln india
Boom
Nice
Omg! You get goosebumps after watching this!!! It&#39;s all about Royal and great Peshwas (y)
Ranveer singh is better actor than that flop actress kangana ranau because she is not a yash raj heroine,yash raj films lucky mascot,yash raj films blue eyed girl and yash raj talent non of these kangana she is flop actress.Ranveer  is a yash raj hero,yash raj talent,yash raj films lucky mascot and yash raj films blue eyed boy.Therefore Ranveer is better actor than flop actress kangana.

тЩбтЩбтЩбтЩбтЩбтЩбтЩбтЩб
we have great rich history, i am expecting such movies for all hidden histories, The great Hamir and Gora-Badal, which we don&#39;t find in indian history books.
that&#39;s d carrier end movie for director..  you may say DEVDAS 2
Wow
WOW. It looks magnificent.
Only ignorant people could hate this film. Hope india havent
If it is the movie which was made to portray love between lead characters, then i am done with it.Bcz jodha akbar has already done that. If it is about the greatness of BAJIRAO, then this is on my watchlist.
pls release in telugu also
superb trailer.all d 3 actors are up to d mark.
who need baahubali when we have bajirao mastani
Waiting waiting and waiting
After 12 long years Bajirao Mastani is releasing with a new and refreshing cast.Bhansali&#39;s magnum opus is now a dream come true
Great epic love story.....cant wait....to watch this movie...astonishing official teaser trailer
My expectations for BAJIRAO MASTANI are too much. I want this movie to break all the BO records till now in Indian cinema. The teaser itself is increasing my heart&#39;s pounding.............. Can&#39;t wait till December and that&#39;s too much
Outstanding Trailer.Can&#39;t wait to watch this one.

Alaa re aala bajirao peshwa aala.. Finally an ode to India&#39;s greatest military journal and who better than Mr Bhansali.. Time for Bollywood to redeem after screwing with Samrat Ashoka&#39;s legacy by hakla SRK.. Waiting for December.. Let the game begin..
marvellous superb
Can&#39;t wait for it! Intriguingly amazing trailer. Impatient enough to see Deepika bedecked up  the royal way! 
ЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧЁЯТЧ <br>Amazing one <br>Waiting to watch it on big Screen 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDEExEhvk1Y&amp;t=155">2:35</a> Is this a sword !
I am sure this movie ЁЯОм will have a better plot including conspiracy and race for the throne
the guys complaining about not having dialogues and flexible sword ever complained in baahubali how prabhas flew in the air through small push of tree or how he drew a tattoo beneath water with water colou... I admire baahubali but liked this trailer as well. Learn to respect hard work..
I liked it  ЁЯФетЬМ
Bajirao ne mastani se mohbbat ki hai ayyashi nahi<br>SOMEONE PLEASEE TRANSLATE...I understand only one word!!!! And Google Translate didn&#39;t help at all!
Awesome teaser <br>pc looking cute 
he should be a triple jumper !
Peshwa bajirao ki jai
Brilliant trailer n amazing performances by Priyanka ranveer deepika n others simply wow just wow epic drama film

Only one word..goosebumps.<br>DP n PC rocks as usual no need to describe them.Ranveer emerges as da most versatile actor in recent time. Looking 4wrd 4 da film n da music.<br><br>
Ranveer rocks... Film gonna do well commercially and critically...
Jai naya baaaaashah of Bollywood ranveeer singh bab├а jai ho!!!!!
The movies about the love story of Bajiro and Mastani and how they werent accepted by the community, since Mastani was Muslim.
Osoooooome trailer slb runveer acted so well
I cannot Breath!!! Too much excitement
Just love Deepika&#39;s nathni. It&#39;ll be the hottest fashion accessory of 2015
Different kinds of people compare this film with bahubali.but truth is that,the bahubali is imaginary story,the bahubali is not true story.The Bajirao Mastani is true love story,so don&#39;t compare Bajirao Mstani with bahubali. &quot;Best of luck&quot; team of Bajirao Mastani.
priyanka you look so beautiful in maharashrian attire &lt;3 &lt;3
lai bhari!!! baji re baji re baji
am i the only one who thinks its gonna be better than bahubali????
Wow it will make 350 cores+ 
Bhansali movies only work in location, casting,┬а picturisation and ofcourse trailor... Hope┬а this┬а movie work in story as well..
i m speechless
Oh!! Bansali cracked it again<br><br>Like ram and leela <br><br>Bajirao and mastanee okay
Blockbuster... gonna rule the theatres
Awesome trailor. M damn sure this movie will make huge box office business and people will love it too. Bajirao Mastani will rock the year.
Sheer magic and brilliance in one movie... and this just a teaser... speechless and goosebumps... so excited. amazing cast, cinematrography and direction... :)
Its awesome.. thanks god making got delayed and they have recast the film...<br><br>salman khan ke bas ka na tha ye role...<br><br>wo kick, ┬аjai ho, bajrangi jaisi movies ke liye hi theek hai,, he wud have ruined the epic...
Every frame looka marvellous except the onw on which release date flashes . Man pls think of a better release date dont clash with Dilwaale
yes i am a huge SRK fan and an honest opinion from me...... ┬аI could not understand why there weren&#39;t any dialouges in the trailer xcept for one at the end. ┬аAlthough the visuals are just awesome. ┬аneed a few more promos with dialouges to understand the whole concept of the movie.
Wow!  Very amazing movie.<br>When I saw the promo I felt the desire to see the movie.<br>I liked the role of pc and Deepika but i loved sow much role ranveer. BAjirao mastani best film
ranveer singh superb acting.
Full On Kadak. CinemaGrihaat Nakki hya chitrpatala baghaayla jaanaar. Thanx Sanjayleela Bhansali for Such fab movie. Everyone one is lookin&#39; perfect at their own scene lovva it. Looking forward for music release and later for MOVIE.
mind blowing, awesome now India really started thinking about the movie
That song (or tune) at the end gave me chills
can&#39;t believe people have not seeing a sword like that before!!
Shaandaar┬аdrashyon┬аse prabhavit hone ke baad ye sunkar bheja kharab ho gaya ki┬аBajirao ne mastani se┬аMohabbat ki hai aiyaashi nahin.. kyaa paagal hai.. promo banane┬аvale ne┬аiss diolouge men aisa kyaa khas┬аdekha ki┬аpromo ke end men iss ghatiyaa si line ko┬аgused diya. arre bhai epic movie banai hai, to kuchh aitihasik kahte, har jagah love love┬аaur┬аlove hi ghusedte rahoge to┬аfilm ko janta se rubaroo hone ke liye jagah kaha milegee. sala pichhle┬аsau salon se Mohabbaton ki been┬аsuna┬аrahe ho┬аkabhi to┬аiske┬аalava┬аbhee kuchh socho, har film love story banakar rakh dete ho.

Eagerly waiting to watch this epic part of our history on big screen.<br>A big fan of epic historical movies.SLB sir hopes are high from you.
only one dialogue on 3 minute trailer
waiting for cinema ranbir look same as Bajirao Peshave
Well thank god the bollywood movies being released in the second half of the year are something to look forward to. But how this competes with Srk/Kajol&#39;s Dilwale at the box office is one to watch.
Ranveer, Priyanka and Deepika in never seen before roles! A lot of HARD-WORK and PASSION into making this BREATHTAKING movie!!! BM is already a WINNER for me :D
Wow...
I want Bajirao Mastani to win a National Award + a nomination at BAFTA or the Oscars, it would be AWESOME!!!
EPIC.
<b>shivering with goosebumps</b>
cant wait for this to come out. looks good
Man i am impressed .
Deepika and priyanka rock
Wow this this looks big , bolly woods best actresses

Outstanding!! Ranveer n Dp n pc are slaying it !

Ranveer is quickly establishing himself as one of the most versatile Indian actors. Suspect this will be his movie, he completely owned Ram Leela per the requirements of SLB style metatheatrics. Priyanka&#39;s character seems deliberately hidden from this teaser. I wonder which version of Kashibai from from historical accounts SLB has chosen to portray.
OMG.... this is BIG !!! breathtaking , spectacular !!
deepikas character looks sooo promissing<br>i love her soo much
le chava
Great trailer other than &quot;Bajirao ne Mastani se Maahubbat ki hai, aiyashi nai&quot; (in ┬аTapori accent, with extra cheese ) !!
Yes truly sensational.
Truly awesome love for Ranveer Dips and Priyanka ,PC look fantastic!!!!!!
PROUD TO BE MARATHA. JAI MAHARASHTRA. JAI SHIVAJI. JAI HIND.

If This movie goes hit every Maharashtrian ┬аwill remember Ranveer as Peshwa Bajirao for deacdes to come, no matter what he does in future
awesome trailer truly breathtaking cant wait for 18th of december....a true SLB treat
OMG Superb.... 1st Day 1st SHow Dilwale.... 1st Day Night Show Bajirao mastani ...
For all those questioning Bajirao&#39;s sword. It&#39;s called a Daanpatta/Dandpatta used in Mardani Khel which is a Maratha martial arts form. Daanpattas were mostly used by the Peshwas.
bajirao mastani and dilwale clash must b avoided
awesome awesome
background score is the only thing i liked in this trailer
I am definitely gonna watch this movie in a theatre .Most of Indian historical movies are based on the glorification of mughal Invaders .Finally a movie like this comes which is based on the life of ┬аthe real  brave son of the Indian soil who didn&#39;t lose a single war against  invaders .I  request every indian to watch this movie in theaters and make it a hit <br>Jai Hind.Jai Maratha
PRIYANKA is looking damn hot
Priyanka ЁЯТЭЁЯТЮЁЯШШЁЯТЯЁЯШН
in last why the swors is move? (Sorry for my bad english)
Looks really promising.... and I really want dilwale to to fail.....

The trailer does not reveal much and nor is it that great but it does not mean the Film will be bad, lets wait and see, remember there have been so many trailers that look good and the films are bad
Priyanka Chopra is a goddess.
Ohhhhh my god its so amazzzzzzz
Ranveer baadshah badshah badshaash dilwale is going down garanted 
waiting for 18th December. It&#39;s going to be a blockbuster.
looks like another majestic drama from bhansali i really hope masala movie dilwale flops against this masterpiece
Wow, I got goosebumps..
Love the trailer, but it could really do without the last scene. Why do filmmakers always feel the need to add mindless gravity defying stunts, even in a serious movie like this? Other than that, looks marvellous! 
Maratha.........I like it ....ab dekho marathi asmita..... 
Amazing trailer...waiting eagerly fow dis movie
B L O C K B U S T E R WRITTEN ALL OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Every frame is a picture! This film is a work of art! Hats off to SLB. Simply cannot wait to see the film! 
Awesome
Priyanka looks beautiful in the teaser. My favorite part was when she puts the helmet on her head, and her reaction changes for every millisecond.
ranveer u r best
I doubt Dilwale will be near as good as this movie. Looks like I will be watching  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bajiraomastani">#bajiraomastani</a> !
Absolutely extraordinary :) Ranveer Singh is the best  :) He is here to rule Bollywood. 
I am expecting amazing performances from all three of the actors. Honestly after this teaser I think this movie will do better then Dilwale. In addition, the teaser has gotten over 2 million views on Eros channel in one day. Imagine if it released to YouTube directly.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bajiraomastani">#bajiraomastani</a>
i am looking forward to this...i read Priyanka is working on Quantico and bajirao mastani simultaneously..now it will be interesting how she portrays two totally different cultures and characters on screen :) (Y)
Epic teaser!!
Background score is auwsome
Bajirao ne mastani se mohbbat ki hai ayyashi nahi <br>Epic
Epic teaser back ground music is super ranveer deepika priyanka all look great
EPIC.
Dat one look of deepika.... :) OMG... &lt;3 its awsm.... looking mch prettier dan PC....
Priyanka = beauty,Deepika = fiery,Ranveer = Bajirao 
Finally!!!!!
If the actual movie lives up to the expectations that this mere teaser has set, then I have no doubt that Bajirao Mastani will be a success and will make the money needed to recover costs and make a decent profit. But then again, for me, an SLB movie was never about a box office number. An SLB movie is a cinematic experience that stuns you and stays with you long after you&#39;re out of the cinema hall. He proves this yet again simply by the way he has cut this teaser and turned it into a nuanced work of art. There is a distinct motif linked to each character when they&#39;re seen for the first time in the teaser: saffron flags highlight Bajirao&#39;s Hindu-Maratha pride and valor (note that Mastani is Muslim), traditional incense sticks and lotus designs connote the nobility and family values that Kashi stands for, and literal fire hints at the figurative fire that Mastani ignites in the heart of Bajirao and in the minds of his family. Again, the fire that Mastani uses to light an arrow, Kashi uses it to light diyas in the Bajirao household. Another motif are the parallels between Bajirao and Mastani as they both draw their weapons at three different instances - shooting an arrow, unsheathing a sword, and killing an enemy - simultaneously. As if almost to show that being a woman doesn&#39;t make Mastani any less of a warrior than Bajirao and that they&#39;re companions at home but also in battle. Kashi is colorful and animated in the day, surrounded by Bajirao&#39;s family, who respect her. Mastani can&#39;t afford to do that in the day and appears cold and stoic then, because the entire family is plotting to kill her. She takes comfort in the shroud of the night and shows some emotional side to her only in those dark hours. At dusk/dawn, when night and day meet is when Bajirao fights an epic battle and is about to slay an emperor. If all of this isn&#39;t poetry in motion encapsulated by a mere teaser with no dialogues, I don&#39;t know what is. I don&#39;t know about fans, clashes, and film camps; all I know is that I have yet another truly unique and all-consuming cinematic experience to look forward to, and I wait eagerly to be mesmerized, yet again.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bajiraomastani">#BajiraoMastani</a>
Ranveer looks stunning..&amp; his voice killed me..ЁЯШНЁЯШНЁЯШН

Stunning!! 
Nice trailer!
Magical indeed...... luv luv luv it... тЩетЩетЩе
This looks epic!! The grandeur, the visuals, the feel, and the background score gives me chills! Mr. SLB is a genius storyteller and a Master, respect! Ranveer is by far the best and most versatile actor of his generation, leaving Ranbir far far behind. Ms Padukone is intense and just WOW!!! And Priyanka Chopra, what can I say, the scene where is places Bajiraos&#39;s War Helmet on her head, with changes in facial expressions every millisecond was performed with such ease and elegance, brilliant. Kashibai is so complex, and to me as the most interesting and emotionally challenging part from what I read about, its no surprise SLB choose PC to Portray Kashi.
deepika is awesome cant take my eyes off her ..great screen presence
The cinematography, the anger, the passion, the valour portrayed by the 3 powerhouses of Indian cinemas is outstanding! SLB is a director who knows how to bring the best out of his actors and I am sure he has done the same... This is not just a movie but a majestic masterpiece. As much as I love Deepika, I&#39;m the most excited for Kashibai and Priyanka&#39;s portrayal of her as she was a doting wife who turned evil due to circumstances. The background music and the dialogue at last is giving me goosebumps.. I just can&#39;t wait! 
Ranveer Singh &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ranbir Kapoor
Ranveer Deepika is the best jodi ever....
Wooow awesome trailer can&#39;t waiiiiiit
