All the best Kareena jee n Simi jee. Very nice video. Thanks.
Kapoor khaandaan ka talent plus beauty....Great interview by graceful Simi Garewaal.
Kareena se acchi heroin koi nhi h vvvvvv beautiful
She is bitter inside
Bebo is an extremely honest fierce loving good human being she&#39;s solid everyone think shes arrogant no she&#39;s not she extremely tough she&#39;s very sure of who she is but she&#39;s unapologetic and she&#39;s not dumb she&#39;s clever and classy see this is what kangana doesn&#39;t get she hates on the star kids and celebrities but they live a private life and there very professional however kangana as much as I love her look she doesn&#39;t have limits she doesn&#39;t know when to stop she holds grudges whereas kareena just gets on with it she don&#39;t give a damn what others think but she&#39;s amazing probably outspoken but so that&#39;s her she can be the way she likes she doesn&#39;t care see this is y I dislike the indian middle-class people and media the way they have portrayed people are like they themselves are from the jungle like a gossip auntie who talk rubbish and make assumptions according to there own dirty filthy minds they portrayed priyanka as a girl who used men as ladders and was using casting couch when she had amazing respectful parents and has been bought up so well but back then we didny have cameras everywhere now we do they portrayed bebo as a snobby person whobthinks everyone&#39;s beneath her but time has proven that no matter how successful she became it didn&#39;t take her away from her kindness and goodness kareena keeps karisma with her everywhere after her divorce she kept her right next to her side everywhere she went her friends were also karismas friends u could tell karisma was going through a rough patch and that&#39;s when kareena stepped in fiercely then how can u then call that person a bad human being does it even make sense hoe is she selfish when she worried about lolo aswell and bless saif he supported his wife then look at priyanka calling her a dirty woman when her parents were always with her she was just a free girl that&#39;s it she wasn&#39;t a cheap ho she was just who she was that&#39;s why she got far but indians are so judgemental it is absolutely disgusting I&#39;m glad we moved to Pakistan when we got  the chance because the mentality is sickening even till this day the way they judge people is so low there parents raise there children in a way to hate and create conceptions of people for nor fricking reason the people they should be pointing fingers at is actually kangana look at her history she was dating that green eyed guy she a psycho she was dating him for money and when he wouldn&#39;t get married she done a big drama and then she got a movie with hrithik and went public to try and ruin his reputation because he wouldn&#39;t marry her only cheap women do that type of shit not classy even lately she made fun of a child ananya panday for no reason whatsoever I think that&#39;s when the public started realising how dumb and stupid and pathetic she actually is I don&#39;t blame karan because why on earth should he hire unprofessional 3rd class mentality who will do anything for attention
BTW simmi grewal is one sexy sophisticated lady
The time when Ranbir was Chintuji&#39;s son
Omg i luvvvvv herrrr
Very boastful and arrogant...spoke ill and was jealous of all the actresses during her times.
What karan says about beboo during the scene of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=726">12:06</a> is sooo sooo sooo damn true, like, I look at her because she is my fav, but I’ve seen other people reacting the same way, she is a STAR⭐️
Her voice in this video is sooo soothing to hear💗🥰
She&#39;s telling the truth. She is really simple In dressed and puts little make up on
Kal main avunga na kal pehanunga😂😂
HER VOICE, DAAAAMNNNNNNN❤❤❤❤❤❤
His childhood was so sweet. Ranbir was also a very sweet boy..
From 2024💜😇
That childhood clip of Ranbir Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor with Raj Kapoor Ji always brings a smile on my face :))))))
Indian girls were pretty back in the days. <br><br>Nowadays Indian girls are becoming vulgar day by day
Karan was better in early days
Grand father ke dua qabool hogae heh
Kareena being confused when ranbir said kal mEh Nahaunga kal pehno ga
Riddinma says kareena ka present ka heh
The interview women very beautiful
Assalamualaikum kareena istriku sayang kareena kapoor khan istriku sayang papa Yudi memilikinya kamu istriku aku kareena kapoor khan istriku sayang kareena Aku  🤵👰💍 kamu istriku kareena kapoor khan istriku sayang
I think that Kareena was much more well-spoken back in 2002. She does not speak so well in the interviews any longer.
This is such precious memories ❤
She looks like heroine... undoubtedly ❤
Bebo aap khubsutat hai
Yes Kareena is a Superstar
Cantik nya karena kapor❤❤❤
The intro is AMAZING Ahhaha
kareena&#39;s outfit gosh😢
She was young more than amrita. She very Important for him.make him broken number one family.she do hot lady.
It&#39;s funny Karan saying she is a big star if  people are looking at her instead of shahrukh and hritik .You could have placed any beautiful girl there in nice clothes people would naturally look at her more (if there is nothing so important going on in the scene).She loves flattery and karan knows that .
Luv u kareena
Harvard, 3 months? What is that? Hmmm.
I don’t know when she was arrogant or egoistic in this video, she was asked about herself so she answered about herself, I find her very sweet, and I’ve heard other actors say the same about her❣️
I also hate the computer 😮😮😮same bebo❣️❣️
Her voice is soo soothing to hear 🍯🍯🍯🍯
I don&#39;t have an original personality I stole it from her 🤣🤣
Both looked cute
Pu pu pu
Her mother clearly had an aversion to education 🙄 her sister is a high school dropout.
Pehle ke log chutiya the jo aisa wala dekhte. Honge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=294">4:54</a> She was kind of adorable
#&quot;stop lying Bebo you just like poo.&quot;🤣🤣
Ooh God kareena 😁
രാഹുൽ ഗാന്ധി 🧡🤍💚
karan johar in that TV looks like his is there really
Simi Ji&#39;s presence, grace is magnanimous, her accent is mesmerizing, it&#39;s absolute pleasure witnesses of  such graceful she is..
I ❤️ Au Mama istriku papa cinta aku  llove You too istriku sayang Mama istriku sayang kareena kapoor khan
Assalamualaikum istriku Mama papa sayang Mama istriku sayang kareena kapoor khan istriku sayang
I love babo so so much<br>My darling<br>My queen<br>Sweet apple<br>How I forget kareena<br>Not possible to forget kareena in my life<br>My dream girl<br>Hello kareena where are you baby?<br>Super star queen of the universe
What a useless trash
Dramabaazi Interview
Back in the time i was stunned &amp; fond of the way stars talks n behave<br>But now i can see it was totally fake accent and trying to be more English than indian.
She dressed so bad🤮
Grandiose
She is not that much beautiful
Kapoor girl no brain has gone to Harvard 🤣
Previously she wheatish,  now using foundation to look fair
Karena is absolutely adorable in this interview   ... not to mention stunningly beautiful as well
Baby <br><br><br>A babe <br>The babe<br>Bebo<br>Like woah<br>Are there other sweet words similar <br>Can&#39;t think of any <br>That&#39;s why Bebo, a new word<br>Like a cool Bebe, Punjabi word for mummy<br>Tim and Jeh&#39;s Bebo<br>Or <br>Maybe if you had a friend<br>Younger than you<br>You&#39;d be Bebo <br>Baby&#39;s cool, babe&#39;s sweet<br>Perhaps Kareena&#39;s the best <br>Why Bebo I&#39;d like to know Bebo<br>Is it because I dunno<br>Guess Punjabis have gorgeous names is why<br>And Parsis<br>I thought I&#39;d write a ballad<br>I&#39;m only forty, look twenty<br>You look fifteen <br>Good night
Boht khubsurat thi kareena during early 2000s
Damn this was 20 years ago
Forgive me for saying it but I’ve also known her as a conceited spoiled and pampered character. She’s quite good in such roles 🎭
❤️ Beautiful.interview.Shree.Mati.kareena..khan.Ji Ma&#39;am.Ji.Jay Shree.RAM.Ji.Har Har.Mahadev.Ji.Jay.Hind.Jay.RAJPUTANA.Ji
she was 22 but looked kinda older
Even celebrities were different back then ....
Never liked her and never will.....so proud...haughty...
Kareena is conceited and a snob. I much prefer her sister.
Hay
As always...beautiful Kareena 👍😍
Poor Karishma had to go through a lot of struggle.
I wish you interviewed Karishma Kapoor or Sridevi ji.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=1202">20:02</a>😄
Ну ничего красивого нету грубое лицо
Lol.. kareena looks like valak 😂  dumb lady..poo name is justified for you 🤣 poo means Shit 🤣 so you are definitely a poo
Rendezvous makes everyone so formal
She looks so damn pretty, I love her 00&#39;s makeup 😍 Also I noticed that her teeth looked so white back then 👀👀
Kareena is not good looking at all shocking to c her here
This is how all Indian girls are brought up to be actresses and only a few reach their destiny, baqi ki kahan jati hain?
So much she made m learn t b strong ,confident...thx👍👍
Ranbir saying &quot; acha wala kal pehnunga&quot; and Kareena be like, &quot;aaahhh&quot;
Who knew chintus son will become &#39;Ranbir Kapoor&#39;.
She is totally fake she said she lives in a simple way even in this interview she is so arrogant
I was behaving lyk a normal girl ....what does that mean Madam ...??? So much overconfidence
Kareena kapoor nice but i prefer her sister karisma
Oh God. Too much of fuss for a three month summer course.. do you think ppl r fools? It s not easy for  anyone on earth to get into Harvard for a proper full time course .. she speaks as though she graduated from there🤦🏽 and her family was too proud of her it seems ., why her family is so brainless . No use having money. Fools.
She’s so cute
Just 3 months course n saying studied in Harvard!!! God!!!
now we knw she&#39;s a real girl, when  saw veere di wedding
Earlier days interviews were so much more full of contents. I remembered we were asked to watch interviews to improve our English. Very true. Can see how  classic those shows were unlike now.
She was beautiful and always be beautiful, actresses nowadays are beautiful with so many surgeries on them. But on kareena’s era we have aiswaryarai, Rani, Kajol, pretty Zinta who were blessingly and naturally beautiful ❤️
The Raj Kapoor clip is from early 1990s, which was showed in an episode aired in 2002, of which the YT video was posted in 2013 and I am watching it in 2021.<br><br>Technology has come a long way.
Saif Ali Khan is the best thing happened to Kareena he made her so much better in so many ways
What Harvard?  Some<br>Paid for short programme
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=254">4:14</a>
4.14
Sfgshs
I&#39;m 25 now but I&#39;m sure this interview was done when I was young....but I had no idea they had &quot;video calls&quot; back then
I came to YouTube to show this video only for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=1098">18:18</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=1250">20:50</a>
Her laughter in her childhood! SO Cuteeeee!
I really didn&#39;t know she was a student of Harvard!!! It means she is much more amazing than I thought.
PeeCee once said, &quot;She&#39;s so much misunderstood but she&#39;s actually so sweet.&quot;
What was she doing in Harvard
She has gone through a lot !!
Karinaji beautiful actres
Went to Harvard for Party , Seriously 😂
Classless. Look at her and Ash and you can tell how classy Ash is compared to the other trashes in bollywood
An actress who felt herself higher than God,who even wrote &quot; pregnancy bible&quot;, such an act of blasphemy. Remember,however rich or high you are,never challenge God,He can change everything in a twinkling of an eye.
Ranbir at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=349">5:49</a> 😘
She is so beautiful and full of Life.
All the kapoors are beautiful and cute😍😍😍😍
ugly face...kareena
Ab khatam ho gya in kapoor ka fame
We r lucky to have actress like u love u mam
video call in 2000s. Too much
Simi Garewal is almost always more beautiful more glamorous  than these heroines
That&#39;s real honest kkk
She&#39;s laire look at her now she&#39;s married
What did Riddhima say about Kareena? Please translate it in English.
Wow Kareena Kapoor The GREAT LEGEND
Genetically Predestined = NEPOTISM
ENTITLED BADLY BEHAVED EGOISTIC STAR GRAND KID
Kapoor girl... No brain..... Such honesty 😂 respect for that
Kareena 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sooooo fake.!
ab inki sachchai samne aa gayi h .... fake persons
In here she’s having a humble impression. I’ve watched her work in 🇩🇪 as well.
Pahale ke dino mein etna attitude nahi karti thi...jitna ab karti hai
Wow
kareena&#39;s father name was Randhir Kapoor, how in clip write down as Rashi ???
Shes grown and matured so much since this interview when she was young and immature and just cheesy.  Now shes elegant and a real fun lady.. we  all learn with age and saifs really brought out the best in her.
legendarios simi garewal y kareena kapoor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5LQmODJ4wQ">https://youtu.be/l5LQmODJ4wQ</a>
Honestly karisma kapoor struggled a lot n made kareena vvvvv easy...karisma kapoor before 1996 was not part of any big banner..she worked hard n placed her  rank in madhuri n kajol row
Asshole queen bullshit
Wow Kareena
Yes she is now more than poo.. so much of attitude
One of the most arrogant and an overrated actress. She made such filth comments on Bipasha and Priyanka. She is such a looser
We want you to come back with another wonderful show simi
Harvard returned Kareena 😂😂😂
Listening in 2021
at that time they referred ranbir to as chintu uncles son lol<br>today chintu uncle has passes ... im sure he is in peace .
Not into Bollywood anymore but  &quot; I lost my dadu (grandpa) this yr n  watching this I missed him...
I bunked too. 😘😘
I❤️ kareena
How many times she says “oh god”.. so annoying ..
my most favorite actress
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=330">5:30</a>
U change Ur topic now u are higher poo character
Raj kapoor&#39;s grandaughter, Kareena blessings
Why so much hate on her I dont understand !!
Such a brat!!!!
i love kareena&#39;s personality. shes confident not cocky.
Don’t complain and put down Bollywood Actresses,they are better and more decent than Hollywood Actresses,Bollywood actresses are beautiful and Hollywood actresses are sexy,that’s all.
Very sexy and hot kareena
Hello Salaam hello dearest  kareena as model funny 👍🧡🌹👌❤cool very eyes cozy Masahallah Ameen Masahallah cute
Waste product
She is more genuine now...n more beautiful...changed...those times I didn&#39;t like her..now she is like..❤️poo she is the one
Ugly actress
stupid cow
Whatever..zero talent!
So self obsessed kinda.. poo in her personality.. dresses like her.. talks like her attitude also same.. Karishma is wayy better
Mohd abdulla para good news.
Kareeeeeeena 🌹
She doesn&#39;t like computers and she would do micro computers n all.....huuu
Kareena earned my respect ..
Karishma is better than kareena
The More I am Seeing U Madam Simi.. I am Respecting Ur Elegancy. Namaskar.
Ohh god she is soo fucking beautiful ❣️<br>Just lovee the way she is<br>I Wann be like her 🥺♥
I feel kareena is so arrogant.... And full of herself
Extremely good discussion. Kareena jee is so beautiful charming n gentle. Her enormous n innocent looks r the arnaments of her good career. She is one of the most popular super actress in Bollywood. Simi jee is so beautiful n very renowned  personality in her respected media field. This is a very popular programme. It is a matter of pride to join this programme. All the best Kareena jee n Simi jee. Very nice video. Thanks.
THAT IS CHINTOO&#39;S SON--who became the biggest star from the Kapoor clan after Raj Kapoor
Her family was upset because she went to law college like a normal child... one line shows all the arrogance!
&quot;oh&quot; &amp;  &quot;god&quot;.
Awww struggle !!! Awwww 😂
Jhoothi eak number ki 😁😁
Really she doesn&#39;t leave her acting for a second, even when she is not on movie set. full on drama queen
Gosh- so up herself! Wow
My fav Bolly actress does Simi also have an interview with Bipasha?
Such a beauty my fav
A good video. Thank you.
Kareena looks like a misfit in this show.. She’s more appropriate for cheap gossip shows like KWK
Madam ne interview clear kia Harvard ka har koi nahi kar pata
She is also talking about struggle..simmi asked her why you say struggle even she was like kapoors and struggle 😝😝😝 and she has seen a lot 😝😝😝😝 bas apni behn ko rote hue dkha hai movies ke liye that&#39;s a struggle and she has become so strong after that ...kuch bh kaho kapoors ho tum.. STRUGGLE !!!!
Life is a drama 😒😒😒that&#39;s why she made her life a drama
Nepotism doesn&#39;t work struggle is there
Kareena and Kardashians..<br>Hmmm...
Just hate her 😡😡😡
The best thing abt this interview: The video of Raj Kapoor showering affection on his grandkids.
Dear Simi mam,<br>It would be great if you could come up with the show cherishing and celebrating women who have made great names in different fields right from the defense field to the art field. That would be an inspiration for all women who go behind society beauty standards and validation from society. You are an epitome of grace, empowerment and courage, so no one better than you can do this. Please consider this request. <br><br>Regards<br>Arya
“I am too simple a girl” “I wouldn’t care about how my hair looked” why do I feel like she lied during these few seconds 😂
Love her or hate her but you can&#39;t deny she is stunning n a brilliant actress.
Just look at her before all surgeries &amp; glow complexion treatment and she said that i m simple girl &amp; i never wore dress like that...i just want to say bitch plzzz 🤣
&quot;Hein...&quot; 🧡🧡
She is a star ⭐️
I don&#39;t find her honest I found her dumb so much arrogance is not good.
I wish I had such a mother. A great mother like that.i had a devil in the form of mother who used to put me down and make me feel horrible about myself.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=575">9:35</a>! How I wish I had gotten such a mom like Babita Kapoor.
Star kids talk about struggle, ha ha ha.
I don&#39;t like her she is too artificial.  She not talented like sonakshi etc
Ohhh she has struggled! :) Really :)
&quot;Kapoor girl no brains has gone to Harvard” 😂😂😂 idk why but that cracked me up so bad
A person watching in 2020, will absolutely puke on Karan and kareena&#39;s face . I just hate her more after she ridiculed SSR in Karan johar movie
Kareena was soo full of herself;a haughty woman but she was also very honest
How many of them came here to watch this interview after watching sara and saif interview with simi ji... 🤔🤔🤔
Surrogate baby will not cry she is real
Diva
Kareena has never been honest she can&#39;t I think she doesn&#39;t like admitting even though she knows what the truth is
Well, we all know how she got into Harvard 💵💵💵💵 even Sarah Ali Khan didn’t get into Harvard, and she’s extremely smart
Totally awesome
Bony,astute,ctg.
She is the most cutest acteres in Bollywood  bebo luv you❤😘😍
I love her she is so so cute and beautiful 😍💓💙
I loved it when she said that in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=1334">22:14</a>.
She didn&#39;t admit that she used to introduce herself as Krishma&#39;s sister. So proud.
Lol My sister is also my Best friend though we fight lot lol
I love her and what&#39;s the problem if she  love herself more? Atleast she appreciates everything. 💯
Love you bebo... Great actress
Yeah Karan is so amazing paving way for people like you.
Yikes what&#39;s that outfit.
HAHAAHAHAHA, so Kareena kapoor knew programming back in those days, 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 just imagine the sight of her typing C++ programs on dev cpp 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hate Kareena, very arrogant....
So fake she is!! Struggle 😆😆😆😆
Open caption and see 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂what karan johar said &quot;u r just like poop&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Ranbir so cute😍😍
Lockdown
Bebo❤️🔥🔥
I love her she is soo beautiful,<br>Edited: And also honest.
Totally adore her!
HEY YOU! Yes, you, sitting behind your screen reading this. I don&#39;t know you and you certainly don&#39;t know me. But I want to tell you something. Everyone has their own story. Yours might be filled with joy and happiness, or it might be clouded with pain and misfortune. I want you to know that you&#39;re a beautiful, wonderful, talented person. Even if your life isn&#39;t going the way you want it to right now, I know that you&#39;ll be able to make it out alright. I want you to do me a favor. I know I&#39;m just a stranger, but just trust me, okay? Every time you see your reflection, be it in the mirror in the bathroom, in a window somewhere, or in a puddle on the street, I want you to look at yourself and give yourself a hug. Because even if you aren&#39;t the prettiest or the smartest or the funniest, you&#39;re something that no one else can be: you. And you are the greatest thing you can be. Smile at strangers. Be confident in yourself. Cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you feel like laughing. Treat yourself like a god/goddess because you deserve it. Hold your head up and keep your heart open. You&#39;re worth everything and then some. And always remember that no matter what, even if it doesn&#39;t seem like it, you&#39;re everything to someone.
I LOVE YOU
22 years old Kareena looked more fresher and younger than todays 40 years old Kareena.
Karisma was not a very good actress in the beginning of her career.  Thats why people didnt support her.  She was too young, she should have finished school first.
Babita did  not do those girls any favours......why so many enemies?  They have money but no love
She&#39;s so full of herself! Karan caught her lies and saying be yourself. She never hard any tears in her eyes after seeing the video but did a bad action about it!
Kareena kapoor is rhe most beautiful actress
She is really a star now but not a great actress, she is my favourite heroine but to be fair she is weaker in terms of acting than her contemporaries but everytime give tough competition but its sure that she is a superstar and her personality is superb
Love the eyes
Karan johar n Kareena r such fuckin liars.they copied the character from wild child..n so many Hollywood movies ..
What is up with their accents? did&#39;nt anyone notice?
Kareena was beautiful b4 natural face
Two chodkad bat kar rahi position ke bare
Shessssss sooooooo dumbbbbbbbbb
Kareena has a beautiful face and a repulsive personality! She reminds me of Dorian Gray. :(
She was so grounded before 🙂
2020 like plz
The video💕💕💕
Bebu is tempting,........is my.ctg,Ban.
“ I don’t like the computer ”
I mean a beautiful  and talented  Indian  actress
I am not a fan of Bollywood movies here in Canada  but I think karena Kapoor is great  Indian acytess.i  saw a lot  of hindi movies with English subtitles growing up in the Caribbean  of East Indian  ORIGIN. I think I will see India  movie  again at the Albion cinema here in Toronto
Plz mam...invite karishma kapoor on ur next show whenever it&#39;s comes
She is sooooooo beautiful kareena
Kareena princess simi Angel
I&#39;m in love with Ranbir here<br>KAL nahunga na toh kal phenungaaa ...:*
I hate kareena just bcz of her jealous to ameesha
Kareena is dumb from childhood 😂😂
I&#39;ve watched many of her interviews and people criticising her for being herself in the comment section and everyone in this world give lectures on how to be oneself,don&#39;t change yourself,Be You and blah blah....This outlines the level of hypocrisy of folks around in our society. I feel people find it hard to digest her heavenly praise....By this I mean her birth in a royal starry family...a guide like Karishma,which she accepts in this conversation and a bang on career.
Ranbeer is too cute 😍
The more I watch all these interviews, the more I realise that most of these Bollywood stars grew up privileged. Wealthy families, connections, a network that helped get them their careers. Isn&#39;t there a Bollywood star with humble beginnings? I&#39;d like to know.
Such a arrogant woman 😂 so fake !!
Why she didint interviewed karisma
She talk nuts maybe she act like she understand the question but she no nuts
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=1152">19:12</a> IDIOT
I am so glad we&#39;re past early 2000s fashion.
Ranbir is so cute 😻😻😻😂😂😂
I love <a href="http://kareena.my/">kareena.my</a> favourite
what is she wearing ?
I feel kareena full of herself always ...arrogant and narcissistic personality
5.05 if you search or want to watch Ranbir kapoor  when he was a kid ☺
AVM STUDIO
She&#39;s more beautiful than aishwarya
Two contradictory lines... Intro and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=685">11:25</a>
Dont know why hate comments,,she is full.of herself so what , if this is her way of carrying herself so what&#39;s the issue , she was raw tht time ,she proved herself in movie and in her personal life ,even after 19 yr of career she is doing great ,,she is so lovely...
My all time favorite,
She is a liar. Period
And you kareena as a host in your radio show was worst
Natural beauty :)
Awesome
Kareena is bluffing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=1150">19:10</a>, studied Micro computing BS!!
Karan Johar sees poo everywhere....what a fool?
Meri kareena
Xboyfrnd
Wow. I wish I had her life after watching this video.
She is so natural in this interview
OMG I had tears in my eyes after watching it,  I can feel every word of her and emotions speechless! Simi mam ap bhi bhut acche ho apke is interview se kitna kuch jaanne mila outstanding work
Fancy after being born in such an illustrious family...she prefers to clone pu!
Such an arrogant,  immature,  lying chatter box,  beauty without brain,  lady of Bollywood... At least she must learn something from her sister Karishma who has a lot maturity,  sense, in factagoodhuman....most of the celebrity says about Karena that ah ed is arrogant a real headache for others.
I&#39;m always behaving like a heroine. Yes she is absolutely right in saying so. Always behaving like a spoilt brat.
Love Ranbir ❤️
Yaar.kareena.jesa.koi.nahi.me.bhi.nahi
@simigarewalofficial can you pls do another interview with Kareena please!!!
She was really attached to her grandfather Late Raj Kapoor sahaab
Is one of her eyes darker than the other?
Jealous 21 brand one of my favourite Brand.... 21 is d very exelent age.... That&#39;s d actual real age to realise n decide what u want to do in ur coming future
been 17 years and she&#39;s still the boss
This girl has always been fake. No personality or depth. She’s both dumb &amp; dumber 😂 How was simi tolerating this stupid girl?
The comment section down below clearly shows how fiercely JEALOUS are people with Kareena. Especially the women. Coz actually they all secretly admire her BUT they know they can never be like her and that’s why they pull her down. But facts are facts.. she is and has always been the GRATEST SUPERSTAR Bollywood has ever got. She took over every other actress after stepping in Bollywood. And ofcourse... why will people appreciate her straight forward ness and her being full of self love and self admiration..coz all the ugly aunty jis and uncle jis just like women who can do all the Rona dhona all the time and just can’t stand girls who are strong and outspoken. And certainly these people just don’t love themselves and that’s why seeing Kareena love herself is not acceptable to such idiots.
She is only 17 here and so much maturety
Kareena ki bachpan or taimur ak jaisa
Hus the other small girl??
She is one amazing strong women. Getting in harvard when noone from her family did it’s extremely brave. People who are all saying that she did nothing should applyto harvard once and then talk. She is confident because she struggled on her own and made her name. Stop with the negativity and appreciate the fact that she did and still doing great.
Simi Ma&#39;am, I wish and hope you have a Rendezvous with Salman Khan, so, we his fans would get to know the person he is.. I love your style and language and the way you conduct the Rendezvous.

i love u karreena leave saif and come to me
Kareena looking so suit
Wtf is she wearing? 🤢
My diva
Woo kareena looking gorgeous
SImi garewal love her look and style
saale kye lag rahi hai, saif is a lucky guy
WOW... Havard Summer School... perhaps these are the privileges I am a wee-bit envious about... BUT it is pretentious of her to make it sound like she is a four year Harvard graduate. THEN again...she is from a family with its healthy portions of &#39;ego&#39; ... AND she so much NEED to learn what &#39;PILLAR TO POST&#39; actually means... trust me, her family does not fit that... just because her sister was CRYING at night, does not qualify for &#39;suffering&#39; ................. has this woman noticed the thousands of homeless, hungry, unclothed children in STREETS of BHARAT DESH??????????????????????????????????? That is SUFFERING... having WEALTH at your fingertips, your FAMILY NAME backing for your FILM career............... IS NOT SUFFERING... heck, she had the privilege of Simi Garewal in her life...
Chotu ranbir the cutest “ mai kal aunga na kal pehnunga” to bebo 😂😻😘😘
ohhh really ...u r a simple girl ........😶😶😶soooo strange
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=1334">22:14</a> kapoor girl , no brains😂😂😂😂
She is really sounding cocky....struggle? You were born into a film family God damn
She was my fav
She kinda remind me of aishwarya.
5.40 ranbir kapoor so cute yaar..kal me nahauga n kal pehnuga...wow 😂
Ab Karina bdl chuki hai.. Ptani ku.. But Muje ab Usme proud fel hota h.. Jo phle k Tim m ni tha..
How simple and innocent Karina used to be at that time but now her dressing style is too weird.
2018 Dec
Priyanka is far better than you idiot!
Ranbir kapoor 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Little Kareena and Ranbir r so adorable. 😍😍
What crap is she talking?
I like her confidence
Karina over acts not only in films but also in real life
She freakin went to HARVARD!!<br>She got brains
She was so beautiful!
Same personality she doesn&#39;t changed as other celebrities wow
She was so immature back then.... Looks like she has sobered down.
Love this
Kya mujae koi btayega kareena nae kya koi surgery ker wayi hai
C est cool je t aime kareena
what crap this Karan spoke. in that place even if you place rakhi sawnt , people would see only her...….both men are in black so the other colour red outfit stands out. big deal!
She is so confident❣️ I love her .
She looks like she just got up from sleep and talks like she by-hearted all the dialogues
If Raj Kapoor was still alive, would he be a victim of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo">#metoo</a> movement?
ranbir😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
*Kapoor gurl wit no brain*😂😂...
Kareena ❤ The Diva of Bollywood!! 💕
She is a good actoress!!! With less beauty!!!
kareena is beautiful here bt nw she luks different...
Ohh god ranbiiiir is soooooooooooooo cute
She is soooooooooooooo overrated
I was keep looking at Ranbir.....he is so cute as child....n now most good looking man on earth.....my fav n crush <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ranbir">#RANBIR</a> KAPOOR😘😙😙😙
Because they really are the best
Long live the Kapoor family always
Crazy girl.    Students spend 5/6 years in Harvard
This women does not know what pain is  she should go work in a cancer unit in a children’s hospital
Love this
Look at how baby kareena says, “Jao” like a bossy sis and Ranbir as a lazy and smart kid, ‘ kal main aunga na kal pehnunga’ 😂 <br>Kids r so innocent
They were damn cuuuute... They&#39;re looking so adorable playing with Raj Kapoor<br>And look at Ranbir &quot;Kal nahaunga na Kal pehenunga&quot; 😂 so cute.
She is the beautiful woman in this world
she is over reacting.
Okay you&#39;re beautiful, but maybe you should be a bit more humble.
Preity zinta is way more beautiful than her but i still like kareena
Yaha jab kareeña simpl thi aur sach bolti thi aur over nhi thi .kitni achi thi
Are you kidding me? a summer course and she talks like she got a masters degree from Harvard! -_-
this entire Kapoor family has problem of being humble..the word doesn&#39;t exist in their dictionary..
Kareena s love for her mother and sister is respect worthy
So she has one eye green and the other brown
Just love you bebo
Nice show....I luv it
kya mast ladki thi kareena
Am not a fan of Ranbir Kapoor but he was actually cute in his childhood days saying &#39;&#39; Mai kal nahaunga tab pehnunga&#39;&#39; 😂😂 and Kareena is more cuter by just sayin &quot;Hein&quot;😧😂😂
i love u so muchh bebo
Itna kuch Kiya Bachpan main thori acting bhi seekh leti...lekin Kia kerti...karishma k Saath rehti thi na...kahan se acting seekhti bechari...
today&#39;s actresses nothing in front of her
she was always beautiful
Love you bebo
I know her name was Poo in the movie but it’s so funny when they are talking about it and when she says ‘At home I had just become Poo’ 😂😂 💩
She reminds me off a man in drags lmao.. there are so many great actors better than her she just happen to be from a Kapoor family!! Sucks for the real actors get pass !!
Karisma hated them so much she didn&#39;t invite them to her wedding, now all of them in each others arse.
See how when similar asks that&#39;s chintus son ranbur and kareena gave a silent nod without saying anything further. She hated them
Kareena was in cold war with neetu and ranbir riddhima<br> Babita hated them so did the sisters
Great actress
I love her ❤❤
Love u kareena...
Kareena was very impulsive back then, brought up like a princess, pampered as the youngest girl...And unlike other celebrities like Aishwarya or Rani who come to this show as outsiders, Kareena has actually grown up close to Simi n other veterans, and so is too comfortable on the couch. <br>She is dishing out personal details like &quot;Everyone in my family failed 8th or 10th repeatedly&quot; which normally people would not say otherwise on national television. I am glad she&#39;s more groomed now.
All that training failed lol ..what a shit actor
Aww Kareena ..you were a cute baby and still look ravishing..so emotional,so honest...❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Love you Kareena😘😘😘🌹🌹
Kareena was a fashion disaster that time
Love this!!!
Love this!!!
wait.... she was 21?!!!!!!!!?????
Ranbir says to Bebo ! Kal nahaunga naa kal pehnonga :D
Jahil Kareena hate her she&#39;s soo irritative uneducated
Stop lying bebo you are just like poo (poo means shit in English ) hahaha
Kareena you are the best and have more confidence in yourself
Karan Johar &quot; She&#39;s Poo in Real Life today.&quot; Poo is basically short for Poop...
Corrina looks like a humbert dream beauty .. the embodiment of the virgin spring<br>
She is strong willed and I LIKE that. I love people who are fighters and don&#39;t give two hoots about what the world says. It&#39;s so inspiring and invigorating, actually!
2002 ah...the year of anatomy
Sweet Jesus, but she is like a pedophiles&#39; dream..Lolita in presence. Virgin Spring.
ranbir kapoor❤
i miss u  simi jii
im in love with how kareena aggressively gives zero shits about anything hahahah i love her

&quot;Kal aounga na toh kal pahnoonga&quot; ....Oh Ranbir!!!!! 😘😘😘😘😘😘
Dev / yuva/ omkara/ jab we met / we are family / talaash/ chameli/ aitraaz / body guard / ki n ka and all new movies she is doing well she looks better in less make up !
&#39;She&#39;s poo in real life&#39; hahahahah! POO!
so sweet and honest she is the real queen in bollywood
Why is she dressed like a joker in a circus? This is an intimate interview lol
This show remembers me of my childhood memories. Simi is such a wonderful host. Actors were more open those days.
ranbir kappor spotted
she became fairer with time !!
the only thing that I loved n repeatedly watched was that video of cute little ranbir .
OMG! Ranbir looked so cute while he was little :)
No one was allowed to go to HIS room. LolZ. It&#39;s her :))
bebo n puri jindgi film ki pr acting nhi
You are so beautiful Kareena
I miss your show Simiji. And I love the set up with the flowers. Very nostalgic. Much love ❤️
kareen can act shes one of the best actress
I think kareena Kapoor is ugly
Harvard returned.. LoL Perhaps paid for the semester to go there for 3 months &amp; return without any qualifications.. Back in Mumbai brag about having been on the Harvard campus.. Extremely pretentious..
Was that Ranbir Kapoor in the clip?
bebo jaan so cute n vry beautiful
Just came across this. I remember watching it when it was first aired on tv! old is gold :)
love u kareena
omg lovely. Vedio with Raj kapoor ji... awesome. loved this one . Simi&#39;s MAGIC😍😘😘
Simi ji please take the interview of Vidhyt Jamwal
Can you please upload videos with higher definiton?
kareeena...is so beautiful in all the ways... :)
this over-acting, high with ego, hyper active, &amp; irritating girl was no onewhere in the list till Jab We Met!! it was Aishwarya, Rani, and preity who were ruling the industry...she could not overtake them until they settled with their stardom...but yea now she is changed a lot...
kareena you look so beautiful,,,,,,,,,,,,stay blessed
Lmao Kareena you have one regret you wish he was still alive <br>What ? You mean you killed your grandad and you wish you hadn&#39;t. No sense.
I like her simplicity
beautiful voice Madhuri
I like kareena so much
Awwww look at ranbir!!! Soooo cutee!!!!
I like ..like ...like karenna kapor
She is Poo! Hahahaha! 
She cannot conduct herself in an interview. Oh, well.
Kareena has high ego ....
awwww just look at ranbir hes soo adorable &lt;3
damn look at Ranbir <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=300">5:00</a>
did anyone notice, or is it just me, ummm, that attire is so much similar to Poo, herself? Yet she claims, she is nowhere  near Poo in her real life.
arey tumhare baap dada sub movie me the..starting with prithwi raj kapoor... all the kapoors  from RK family becomes stars.. because its a family owen business..only if she was born in average family and become karina kapoor today..thay can&#39;t do anything else..put all the kapoors together ..not a 1 kapoor became super star.. because they suck at a acting..
Jesus, it was a summer course for three months! She is talking about it as if she was a real grad student!
Bebo is just amazing. Love u xx
So full of herself. At least karishma was modest
SHE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STUNNINGLY NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL !!! Her EYES,HER SKIN, HAIR, LIPS, CHEEKS, SMILE, LONG NECK, FACE CUT PERFECT!!! WHY THE HELL SHE LOST WEIGHT!!!????
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHhTbvMFDU&amp;t=720">12:00</a> obv when a women is flashing a huge bustline in betw 2 men why wld anyone look at men??? get a fuckin life karan, we hav seen ur SOTY hw u luv to expose women .... bloody gay !!!

She is so arrogant but I think Saif makes her keep it in check or at least pretend to
Aww baby kareena so adorable
She thinks shes done something extraordinary, but its more than regular...
Luk at her now.
She is so sweet love her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32g6pwja7tA">Kareena becoming old after 32 years.......</a>
always shallow &amp; full of herself.. that hasn&#39;t changed﻿
ranbir looking so cute

 PTI has lost all its support (Read Full Story on “Confuse News”)
