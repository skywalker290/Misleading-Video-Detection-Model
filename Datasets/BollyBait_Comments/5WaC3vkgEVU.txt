You should make one episode showing good movies
Cant help but point out that Kartoos is pronounced as Kaartoos, the &#39;a&#39; is prominent.
Kartus??
I think that Rajnikanth&#39;s recent movies which I found to be good are like Petta, Kabali and Kaala.
The sad part is lingaa has a great flashback. A fight sequence that introduces the older rajinikanth is very well made and quite stylized. They ruined that with the sequence you talked about in the climax.
I sometimes genuinely think if you actually beleive that or say this shit for the sake of the video content.
The problem In bollywood is they think that a strong woman character means she has to be a rebel! That is not the case The best example of this is someone like Haley James Scott from One Tree Hill  and Sandra Bullocks Character from all her movies especially gravity
What about vidya balan making puris in isro to make a point to space scientist
Can you make a video on promising Indian TV series which were shelved only because of poor TRP
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=520">8:40</a><br><br>That shocked me.. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Such a humble man
The Sanjay Dutt movie name wasn&#39;t Kartoos, the way you spoke the name was wrong. It was Kaartoos.
Car + toos = Kartoos
This is why I couldn’t ever watch David Dhawan movies. They were always painful and starred Govinda
Bhaai, Kartoos is pronounced as कारतूस not करतूस...<br>Its painful to come to terms that you make such mistakes in pronouncing hindi names, words when you are following Hindi movies the most.
I can find matlad kuch bhi in every movie I watched
You forgot about the scene where a group of guys try to grope Varun Dhawan and later on when it’s revealed that the guys tried to molest him everyone laughs <br>Like it’s funny if a guy is sexually assaulted
Put subtitles please..

I&#39;m kinda not that offended by the stereotypical foreigner tropes as Hollywood has also done that in the past and so have other cultures it&#39;s what we do as a society.<br>I guess I am shallow that way.
about badrinath ki dulhania, the problematic scenes were there to show how problematic they were right? like afterwards they show how badri starts understanding how wrong his actions and ideologies were. that&#39;s what the movie has tried to portray, how wrong these misogynistic actions and thoughts were, so doesn&#39;t that make the decision of the movie to add those scenes and dialogues not problematic?
As much as I get to know about indian culture man can&#39;t slap a girl. I mean ladki ke upar hath uthana mana tha mahabharat ke time mein aur ramayana mein jab laxman ji ne surpnakha ki nak kati thi tab ram ji ne kaha tha aurat ke upar hath uthake tumne galat kia laxman. Fir yeh sab kyun dikhate hain movie mein i don&#39;t know
Worst actress is alia bhatt
why is homofobia wrong by your athist logic
I was trying to distract my self just to forget the grief of Sidharth Shukla&#39;s sudden demise!  And the irony!! Vdo stars with Sidharth&#39;s kuch bhi wala reaction! Too much for me!😭😭😭😭💔💔
I love ur vdos but god ur intro is so annoying. Plz change it or make it shart
Hypocrite
90% of Indian movies are revolved around a guy wooing a girl
Imagine you are a new film school graduate and excited to work on movies but then they give you script like these 🗿

This kind of content is disturbing. Consumption of such content to this extent can be horrible for one&#39;s mental health. How do you manage with it?<br>PS: I&#39;m talking about the disturbing movie scenes.

Me after watching his videos<br>My perspective towards any bolly films I&#39;ve watched till today: &quot;toxic toxic toxic&quot; saaaarey key saarey saley &quot; toxic&quot;
Please make a video on tollywood movies also where many movies have dialogues which underestimate the power of a women..
Wow badrinath movie came out a few years ago and still so regressive. And Varun Dhawan has the audacity to mention Interstellar.
Just watch South Indian films and chill <br>Bollywood now is cringe and worthless
Please also mention how Alia Bhatt&#39;s character consciously dupes Varun Dhawan&#39;s character in Badrinath ki Dulhaniya. Sometimes while we are good at pointing out the patriarchy and problematic male behaviour, we forget that women are just as human and just as capable of being problematic. Here are a few examples that people never talk about:<br>1. Alia Bhatt&#39;s character in Gully Boy where she literally breaks a bottle on another woman&#39;s head because she is possessive <b>insert Kareena Kapoor Jab We Met meme.</b><br>2. Kiara Advani&#39;s character in Kabir Singh. I mean she slaps him a lot more times than he hits her. It is NOT OKAY to hit anybody in any relationship. Just because Kabir is portrayed as a volatile person, he gets all the flak and nobody talks about Priti&#39;s behaviour because she is mostly quiet and demure.<br>The reason we point out problematic behaviour is that we want to build an equal society where everyone is safe and is respected. So let&#39;s try to treat everyone as human and flawed instead of making it seem like women or people from any other gender can do no wrong.
What also sucked was how badri was molested and then laughed at by his friends turning this actually serious and traumatic issue into a joke. This sends a very weong message to the masses. Just as abuse, stalking, threatening with violence are shown as &quot;romantic&quot; in movies. If only people were more sensitive towards what they watched and supported! But they just put up the excuse that &quot;relax its just fiction. If you dont like it, dont watch it&quot; tf even?
Hey Jammy! I really enjoy watching all your videos.....man! what a comic timing! but just one suggestion, can you put English subtitles when u use those Hindi clips? cuz I don&#39;t speak Hindi but love your videos. Iam from Tamil Nadu.

One thing which we hate to agree but is true..is that.... There are hundreds of KUCH BHII scenes...movies etc... But worked at that time and got what they wanted!!! 😅 for example kuch kuch hota hai.... The plot is seriously shit n silly.. But was super hit at that time.... 🙃
Bollywood is becoming a trash hole.
The Lingaa past was good. It breaks heart, knowing what we have been through

Ugh the level of racism, homophobhia, sexism, body shaming, and complete nonsense is SO HIGH in indian movies and tv serials as well
It&#39;s not &quot;करतूस&quot;.... The word is &quot;&quot; कारतूस &quot;...
Scenes and dialogues that have been showcased in the aforementioned moves should have been censored. Instead of censoring films like Lipstick Under My Burkha or Udta Punjab, films like these should be censored.

There was a video where he talks about all those movies that have scenes that were not really required as he mentioned in this video about mausam movie. Can anybody tell me what is that video called?
Same statements are used for rapes...hindustani ladkiya esa nai krti...ladki uksayegi to ladka krega hi.... such movies has made mindsets of people and the worse part is it still goes on and we consistently think porn may be the only reason for wrong in the society...well it&#39;s the entertainment
Hindi nahi aati kya
Time to watch badrinath ki dulhania again
Voice ko kya hua bhai
Why the hell do you do all these videos.. your incomes is based on the movie industry and yet you are going after it in a cut throat way... In the scene where salman khan does... What he does... There&#39;s nothing wrong in it.. the character he is playing is a stereotypical indian... Cinema does not influence the outside world... Outside world influences the cinema.. hope you understand this.. and stop shitting on the thing that is making you rich.. and in badrinath ki dulhania.. the father character is a negetive character... There are many such fathers out there in our country that talk like that... And shoving alia bhatt in a car trunk is not bad thing.. he knows her... She knows him.. he did that only because she was refusing to listen.. he could have done many wrong things to her apart from shoving her in the car trunk.. pseudo mindset se bahar niklo mr Jimmy pants
Your list was really solid but voice was not clear😅hihi
That’s why I love MEGHNA GULZAR MAM.
But in bkd in the last scene he apologised to her B
is it only me thinking or does this guy look like Guru Randhawa with long hair?
Oh irfan khan 😐🙏🏻🙏🏻☮
I am a lawyer and what Govinda did in his movie mein jhoot nahi bolta his lisence wouldn&#39;t have just been cancelled he could be imprisoned or hanged for attempt to murder on an eye witness

Negative thinking person make hero of movie young audiences follow them without think that they behave as criminals
so now i get it why my society is this way now 🙃
Toilet ek prem katha was no different, It is just disturbing that on one side people will say we should respect women and on the other hand they will enjoying these stupid plots. There is no change in commercial cinema and their double standard which is obvious from what they speak and what they do.
I never understood the characters slapping each other or assaulting each other for comic relief or as justification of a &quot;hindustani naari&quot; 🤦🏻‍♀️ Salman&#39;s characters have slapped so many heroines 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Bro......kuchh bhi.....
Salman bhai ne kya seekh di hai👌🏻👌🏻Dimaag khul gya
Ngl i love how u say ,” matlab kuuch bii”
WTF is this
Kartoos!!!
Why don&#39;t you make the videos in Hindi? You can reach a larger audience and convey more.
It’s Kaaaaartooos please 😭
Some video on Hindi n if possible Marathi serials too...can’t forget the typical stories they’re still going on with
I can listen to the title 😃 kutch bhii
Some concepts are OK but I think he is pointing everything in all film.. If so no one can make movies
MATLAB kuuuch bhi....<br>He says it so nicely.
I totally agree with you on all movies apart from Badrinath ki Dulhania, I just feel, that movie had a lot of heart, we understand why Badri did what he did, was he right ? No, but he was really hurt, he actually though Aalia&#39;s character loved him and was happy with the marriage, he wasn&#39;t happy about what he did but couldn&#39;t help himself...some things in the movie were too  much like his molestation on the road, was annoying and not needed but I did enjoy the movie and it did try giving some good messages like not to consider girls as having no aims etc....
It&#39;s kaar-toos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=242">4:02</a> but she is covering her full body, is me kya problem hai (aur agar chote kapde bhi pehethi na to us me bhi kuch galat nahi tha)
God, I&#39;m so embarrassed that for years this shit hole, called bollywood, has made fun of the black people, the LGBTQ community, south Indians, punjabis, nepalis, bengalis, overweight people, women, asians and many more that i forgot to mention.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=275">4:35</a> mtlb khuuuuuch bhiii.... hilarious 😂
Bhai करतूस nhi कारतूस hota h means bullet.
you can make such type of almost 100 videos....and 90% would be on south films....i like many of them....but jyda tar unki movies me logic nai hota....the action espesially....and women centric movies ka bhi scope nai hai.....acchi films bhi hai no doubt...ladkiyan ladkon ke piche padna to jaise compulsory hai south movies mein....actors ko larger than life bana dete hai....
Ek second ek second ... Yeh salman kya keh rha tha ? wth that&#39;s really bad
@jammy high time to change your intro music. A refreshing makeover for 2021
Omg what type of movies they made... One side the world is changing day by day and the other side what they are showing.. Disgusting🤮🤮
Dude can you just teach me English 🤣😅
*Kaaaaartoos 😝😝
Unpopular opinion.. sushmita sen is regarded as a strong woman but her choice of movies were exactly opposite. Looking at one of your vid where you mentioned plot problem with biwi no 1 where one woman tries to demean other to get her man back who actually cheated on her
finally someone talked about Indian movies being homophobic
Bhai ye new movies pe banao, puraani to pata hi hai kaisi thi
I am so glad I found your channel..... You and swaddle are the only two channels I have found who talk sense, and talk about the socio-cultural divide that has been normalised. We may have realized that racism is bad....but there are sooo many more social evils which are overlooked n seen as normal.....really boils my blood. Pls keep making such great content!🤩
Why do you need to talk like reading a book
This guy deserves more subs
I just want jammy to continue talking ❤️

Tabi toh movie se pehle disclaimer aata hai..yeh movie kalpanic hai..ha ha..
The lack of good content and these movies doing well reflect the mindset of the people. Its unfortunate that majority enjoy watching these movies.
It&#39;s called &quot;Kaartoos&quot; my brother, not kartoos.
Homophobia in Indian Media can be a video itself
The last movie I really liked by varun dhawan was &quot; badlapur &quot; ...<br>After that ....it was all trash
😡😡 mad producer and directors
No hate bro u should tell your sister go nd dance with boys they will do nothing I met a guy who was saying I, m not able to control to watch porn on mobile phone I tried hard imagine a girl wearing bikini is in front of u nd she doing garmi garmi 😂😂😂😂😂
Thats why i switched to kdramas✨😌
I m not supporting these movies...but why are we being partial...even Hollywood series like GOT had shown that Daenerys married drogo even when he molested and raped her brutally...why not criticize that too
ya that varun dhawan scene did shock me , i mean you simply kindnap her and then ask her what wrong did i do....asshole man
WTF?! All I can say after watching this shit
I think having no rules is part of the charm of Bollywood . Matlab Rajnikant ke pas swag hei .
For most of the mainstream bollywood, female lead character is there Just to serve to Male lead character.<br>Try noticing it.<br>Major example: Kabir Singh
The actual problem with old movies are they repeatedly slap women for stereotypes reason and marry the rapist seriously and nowadays Bollywood movies are completely psuedo feminist like veere di wedding and four more shots i mean jo actual feminism ho vo to kahi h hi nahi
In short: Indian society is stupid to support these content -_-
Sacchi yarr ye lingaa jese movies me physics ke saare laws ki dhajjiya udai jaati hai 🙃 Aesi movies ko dekhake aese lagta hai jese me tom &amp; jerry dekh rhi hu 😂
How harmful and toxic mentality Bollywood is spreading in youth
Bro sirf itna bata do agar tumhara koi not so close dost Kaala hai aur uske saath jhagda hota hai tumhara and then voh aapko gaali deta hai then aapka return gaali ky rahega ? ???? abey kaale/kaali g**nd/kaale kauee(crow) aukaat mei rah dimag mei mat jaa, etc tum bhi racist hi ho XD.

That Manisha scene is downright insulting.
That climax scene. I&#39;ve never seen such a stupid one in my entire life.
The karishma scene is so disturbing to watch. Downright regressive
The court scene was hilarious af. 😂 Are these actors the people we call legends? 😭😂🤦
The fact that a 2017 movie can be so regressive... says lengths about your society .... we need young talented directors ... NOT THESE OLD LOUSY CREEPY DIRECTORS ...
Good observation 👍

I have watched a few of the movies you listed &amp; I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how bad such scenes were while simply watching. As a kid, wr don&#39;t understand such things but we definitely learn how to respond to such stuff, since we learn to do what we see.<br>Good video!
I so damn like the way you speak<br>It sounds just like a friend talking beside you❣️
Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch bhi

I&#39;m so glad i didn&#39;t grow up watching these films!
I hope bollywood is defamed so much due to all the bullshit they do that no one takes them seriously and they perish by the time it&#39;s 2030 and for the future generations they are merely a silly drawing room topic to laugh over
I have seen yr only point of concern was women mishandling which should be talked about but u r forgetting these are the movies from 2000s when women were really modest and they had certain values and so were the audience  so for that time karishma s scene was not wrong the only wrong thing was slap but if u see full scene karishma knew that those boys were perverts and cheap yet she goes with them ignoring salman s concern so if u knowingly step into filth yes it is yr fault

One thing to be observed , in the comment section regional cinema lovers will try to show that their cinema is classy . Actually in India all kind of cinema whether bollywood or regional is trash , regional cinema is shitty trash.

I am utterly shocked by that Manisha Koirala scene. Can&#39;t imagine how that Black girl would have felt.
I think Indian film writers smoke weed.
Perfect intro though 😂❤️.. You HAVE TO make a video on top 10 actress jodis we would love to see on screen again!!!!! Just like the video you made for the male actors!!!
Do yo really think rajani kanth film actually has real fights
Karatoos was also a shameless copy of ‘Point of No Return’ with Bridgette Fonda and Gabrielle Burns.
That Salman Khan and Karishma kapoor movie scene is horrible. Just think the amount of damage movies like this have already done to the youths of our country. <br>Also I was so mad after watching Badrinath ki dulhaniya. The scene where Varun was harassed and his friends laugh at him. I mean, what the fuck was that for? The makers could have shown it in a totally different way and it would be good message for the society. You can&#39;t just show anything in the name of entertainment.
O.k.
Comparing racism &amp; violence against black people in the US, with stereotyping black face for entertainment, &amp; low-grade discrimination against dark skinned Indians is not the same thing. We never oppressed black people like US did, whereas the US still continues to do so. Don&#39;t be too woke as to forget historical facts &amp; even the current developments.<br><br>Stereotyping ≠ Racism! Just because black or dark skinned people are involved in the joke, it doesn&#39;t make it more or less sensitive than stereotyping others! Stop being biased &amp; lopsided about it already, &amp; view everyone equally!

Itz KAARTOOS not kurtoos.. &amp; yes that yellow dressed girl in the song.. i was a primary skool kid then but i felt so bad that why a black girl is being made fun of.. making fun of natural physical characterstic of anyone shouldn&#39;t be exceptable at all..
Thanks to people like u maybe the Indian audience will change someday and so will the cinema
भाई कारतूस
Badrinath had a lot of issues the one that we brush off is vaidehis folly... she cannot be forced to marry someone she doesn’t want to but at the same time she always knew she was not going to marry him n yet lead him on n humiliated him just to get her sister married or something, that’s not showed as a bad character, she’s only portrayed as a girl with ambition<br>A girl with ambition doesn’t give her the right to make a man believe she was marrying him... imagine this happening to u or anyone in ur family she will be hated not for chasing her drama but leading the man on to this... she could have fought it out but she chose to do this so opposite to the character they tried to show as a straightforward independent strong girl

Born and raised in Canada I watched Bollywood movies as a kid..amazing how so much crap such as sexism, colourism,police corruption and bad acting is allowed and accepted by Indian audiences ..don’t these actors and actresses ever question the content and dialogue? Don’t they have a backbone ?Guess it is about the fame
Bro... You are far too progressive.... We need you....... &amp; more like you. ♥
what the fuck do they film makers
Bwaaahaha! These kuchch bhi videos are pretty entertaining!
Please post another video showing double standards of Bollywood and how they show misleading things just to make their characters more influential and popular among youth
How can you forget Kabir singh!!!  One of the most problematic and misleading movies of Bollywood. Kabir singh slaps preeti and says agar tujhmein bhi mere jitna Pagalpan hai to tu kuch karegi and then is half dead because of the drugs. Why isn&#39;t anybody talking about that. Agar itna hi Pagalpan tha preeti keliye to Uske gharwalon ko manaya kyun nhi?

I think Badrinath was a proof of all r/niceguys. Badri thinks he is a nice guy because he is surrounded by horrible examples of men. And when he was faced with rejection, his toxic nature came out. There were many problematic things in the movie. But I felt that the movie overall showed how &quot;seemingly nice and modern guys&quot; just fly under the radar because they are not overtly toxic like their predecessors.
Would like to clear one thing,at the part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=264">4:24</a> of this video <br>Yes,I agree a girl dancing or hanging out with a with a boy doesn&#39;t means an invitation for harrassment <br>But there is a way for tha, there is a clear cut difference between being friendly and being seductive,<br>In the movie The Character of Karishma Kapoor was dancing in a manner being the centre of three men,that was aimed to lure them <br>But there is way of dancing,
Matlab kuch bhi 🙄....nepotism toh thik hai... Lekin badri nath ki dulhania is absolutely beautiful movie..❤..aur ek baat sach batye aap sach mei jhuth nahi Bolte... Kuch diologh entertainment ke liye hote hai na ki trolling krne ke liye😏😑...bas Karo Mahatma Gandhi ke bete (kyuki tum jhuth nahi Bolte 😂)

People&#39;s ideologies/beliefs keep changing every decade. The society keeps evolving with new ideas and a new belief system gets created by every new generation. Why do you try to stick today&#39;s ideology on the past films, what you are talking today may be question a decade later. So don&#39;t try to rub off your present day beliefs to the previous generations.<br>You are talking about racism was wrong in Kartoos, but the hard reality is even today Indians call Africans as Kaala.... 🤔 <br>Till yesterday even In America George floyd was killed in America because of racism...

This channel is so underrated. 😕
I can recall another instance of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23problematic">#problematic</a> episode in the Ajay Devgan Sonali Bendre movie Diljale. There&#39;s a nice song that goes Ho nahi sakta. In the song, there is a group of young boys and girls pushing a girl at Ajay&#39;s character as a prank and he sings the song. Now this girl is presented in a way so as to appear in stark contrast to the very slender and pretty Sonali Bendre. I did not remember having seen the video of  this song earlier though it is a very popular song but I saw it a couple of weeks ago and I was astounded at the blatant insensitivity of the whole thing. <br>It is embarrassing and shameful that we countenance such vile and degrading content.
Still tripping on the kuch bhi at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=275">4:35</a> lmao

Your voice is similar to Anuj Jindal
bhai tu ne bola &quot;why Indians are obsessed with &#39;fair&#39; skin&quot; agar tu obsessed nehi hota to bolta &#39;white skin&#39; dekho tere liye bhi &#39;white skin&#39; is fair.
Bollywood script writers generally have low iq level

badrinath had loads of issues  :D
There is  Tehzeeb 2003 movie, in which Tehzeeb finds out her husband (Arjun Rampal) love affair in Newspaper, that he is red handedly caught with some publiser, Tehzeeb(Urmilla) is mad &amp; when Arjun comes back she doesn&#39;t talk to her. In the end the lady publisher comes &amp; says, I wanted my boyfriend back that&#39;s why I used your husband &amp; he is innocent. &amp; Tehzeeb is all relieved &amp; patches up with him!!
Was I the only one who knew Salman would slap her instead of helping her?
I love your channel 😎
Aaj kal koi bhi gyaan chod rha h 😂😂
Dobllabllee  match. 🤣
Hindustani larki, Hindustani laraka, Hindustani Maa, Hindustani Behen, Hindustani Bhai.....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dumb actors K muh se dumb dialogue
Badri did have a lot issues in most of the movie, but I think they developed the character well. And I think they were just trying to relate to the audience about how terribly women are still treated in the rural areas.<br><br>Most issues of women were given the appropriate stance by the end of the movie. Except for the stalking part and also the harassment of badri which was shown in a comedic light. The movie deserves more credit I think, it reached a wider audience with much better message than Dabang and such movies.
DIalogues --&gt; Dialogues
Before this video I was creating a meme using the song from kyunki main jhooth nahi bolya
It is pronounced as &quot; kaartoos&quot; couldn&#39;t ignore your &quot;kertoos&quot; :p
Bhi apko yee social problems lag rahe hai tu mirzapur dekh mat Lena gaand faat jaye gii
I think our generation will be alright! We are calling out films we grew up blindly watching and that&#39;s good! That&#39;s growth!
Because Irfan can do anything
That kartoos pronunciation killed me😅
&quot;Mera Bharat Mahan&quot; - so Indian men search &quot;perfect wife&quot; everywhere, and if this is friend&#39;s wife, then that would be more &quot;perfect&quot;! &quot;Mard to kuch bhi kar sakta hai, na&quot;! &quot;Hindustani girls - so innocent, they don&#39;t even know the difference between harassment &amp; love&quot;! All bull shit!!!
What else could be expected from films like these!!!
&quot;Dulhan hum le jayenge&quot;<br>  <br>David Dhawan films: aren&#39;t we all?
Lingaa ... i have seen that scene 😅😅😅
Amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=130">02:10</a>  JTBC
Mind blowing video mlb literally It just opened my eyes and it’s just made me realise that may be I was sleeping this all time and have suddenly just woken up now ...I have grown up watching these movies and through your videos I have realised that cinema can influence your precedence regarding certain things especially colour and creed ... I don’t know if  you know this or not but your videos are educating people on what to watch and not to 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Yeah, most of the south indian movies show hero slapping heroin, but the very second moment she runs behind him and apologise 🙄 I really don&#39;t understand why they dont show self respect of a woman?
When I saw badri ki dulhaniya I was too surprised to see but no-one was talking about it
Pronounced as Kaar-toos mere bhai
Are you on instagram?!
Dahej .... bcoz sanskaar 😂😂
Jammy, I think the whole point of Badri&#39;s character was to get most people who identify with his behaviour to relate with him. Justified by his conditioning and background. <br>BUT, as the film progresses, he starts to see how WRONG he was, and begins to learn how to give Vaidavhi space, freedom, the right to live her life AND to THEN stand his ground against the archaic family norm.<br>It would only be problematic if he never changed or if he was rewarded that behaviour  (e.g. Kabir Singh) but that wasn&#39;t the case.<br><br>They were both products of their upbringing. She, too, only used him as an escape route, as her family stifled her dreams, too. <br>Parents need to do better. <br>It&#39;s not just about these 2 characters. <br><br>So actually, in that instance, the messaging worked really well 🖒
Man Bollywood is a racist place
Seeing Irrfan here in the intro felt so beautiful!
Badri me ye sb dikhane ka mtlb hi yhi tha k admiyo ki or society ki soch esi h or use change Krna h. Vo stalking or honor killing ko durvyavhar nhi mante or vhi chij change krni h. I think solution se pehle problem to dikhani hi hogi. Jyada problematic to ye lgta h koi ladki stalker se pyar kese kr skti h shadi k liye raji kese ho skti h. Alia bhagi b to career k liye Badri k character k karan nhi. <br>Haan 2nd time Alia shadi k liye ready hui dui to changed behaviour and mindset of Badri which was good
Karishma wale scene me ek problem or thi hindustani ladkiya or unki ijjat foreigners ki ijjat nhi hoti kya? Muje to ye scene tb se hi problematic lgta h
Hkd was also a social issue shit like bkd
It was kaaartus not krtus
Irfan sir RIP!
Salman Khan movies are like him
Stalking is so blatantly shown in Indian Movies. May it be Hindi, Tamil, Telugu most of the South Indian movies are male centric and shows them as Demi Gods who can do anything under the Sun except wooing a girl. Their only sure shot formula to make the girl fall in love is to Stalk her incessantly. Till date only Two Tamil movies mentioned the issue of Stalking and Condemned it. But God knows how much it helped audience to understand that stalking is a Criminal Offence. Why O why can&#39;t we have pure and genuine love story where both people are mutually attracted towards each other. Instead of the generic bull shit where one chases and other runs. When they get tired they fall in love. I for once wanna see a movie where the lead male proposes the lead female rejects and he is OK with it. And does not becomes Devdas or does acid attack or rape or defames her character. Just moves away respectfully.
That salman karishma scene frustrated me to hell
Aby kaartooos hota hai kia kartos kartos bol rha hai hindi to sekh le jammy chutiye
The last bollywood movie I watched was tumbaad. And the last movie I watched was parasite, and that was six months back. And now I&#39;m into books specifically novellas and non fiction and that is soul filling. I&#39;m 16 right now and honestly I have always felt bollywood sucked. Portrayal of all the characters generally revolve around a pre framed stereotype the only change being the names on the script. The actors are terrible epitomes of narcissisism ( I&#39;m specifically talking about the shit born out of nepotism) <br>That&#39;s why i stopped watching bollywood a long time ago.
Can you get subtitles?
Sirji thora zyaada horha he 😂😂😂😂
Tu Bs ek YouTuber hai, aur bs ek Faltu insaan.. Agr bum mein hai dum, toh aja samne.. Chutiye..
We call Bollywood shit BUT I can&#39;t believe how far we have come.
That&#39;s why I either watch Marathi movies or english ones.
Kartoos nhi कारतुस
I am so happy that I haven&#39;t watched badri ki dulhania.
Censor should see this type of dialogue to CUT
You are extremely biased now. This reduces your suitability for a source of unbiased review, which first attracted me to this channel. <br><br>Do have a pause. Look at your sets, your cover options and how you are pandering while also putting down others. <br>This may be fine as it gets clicks, but long term your brand equity is getting damaged. <br>Take a pause, audit your last 6 months and review if what is at makes sense try to remove cognitive bias. Touch point if you want to delve into why I feel so, but if not, continues on. Hope you come back to your awesomeness.
isnt it supposed to be spelled as kaartoos🤔?
Hindi film industry*
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=126">2:06</a> is JTBC opening theme?
When he says : MATLAB KUCCCCH BHI
Im still looking Varun&#39;s decent performance, why he got such stardum
Mordern gyaan na baatn  maja nahi aaya
Lipstick under her burkha is such an amazing movie, and was banned. Yet the “Masala” movies are allowed and so pathetic. How did people even accept them?
Just earlier I was watching a video of yours focusing on underrated actors and movies and I feel so disappointed that instead of watching those movies that are so inspiring, people end up watching these pathetic ones instead.
Your voice is so sexy.  Lol.
Okay all here are mentioning badri ki dulhaniya,that&#39;s all good but overlooking salmaan-karishma scene...that hindustani ladki hone ka thing was so damn unacceptable..am so disgusted by it..no wonder why rapes happen I our country and people start blaming woman for it..wish people call out such films more..well done Jammy..we want more series like this
Chup Chutiya kyun ki main zhut nhi bolta was excellent movie and even excellent performance by Govinda...
My brain! My brain hurts!
Lingaaaa 😁No wonder bro That&#39;s Rajnikant 😬
&quot;Ye ayse hote hai&quot;  this makes you homophobic<br>Ok, image upload available nahi hai YouTube comment section me warna &quot;ye ayse hote ka saboot de deta&quot;. I am not homophobic i respect all but you are the one here based hyp0crite. Since they themselves created such image of themselves.
Answer to your video: Video ke naam pe matlab kuch bhi<br>You analyse films pretty much but WTF so dumb you are comparing films into reality.<br>All films are fictitious and nothing are real.
It&#39;s pronounced Kaartoos not Kertoos..<br> Nice video though
Man it&#39;s not these movies, it&#39;s change in the societal mindset. 50 years from now, am sure there will be wrongs in the movies like massan and aankho dekhi.
Hey hey hey, I like your videos so much. (And my close friend is your huge fan) I have a suggestion, would you do an analysis of the Netflix movie &quot;Bulbul&quot; please?
U forgot  ranjhana
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=254">4:14</a> . No wonder we keep blaming victims.
You should not mention rajnikant&#39;s movie in this list. <br>Dude he is rajnikant and everything is right with rajnikant.
I was very young when I saw that song of Manisha koirala and felt uncomfortable....... All the others who Was watching that with me were smiling and laughing....... Mindset of people sucks
I love your voice and vdo
I like watching your videos admiring the fact that you always speak for honest reviews, but what i really like watching your videos is that your voice is really convincing. Your voice is really good, not everyone has got this blessing, and the way you say, &quot; Matlab Kuch bhi&quot;, anyways i just want to say god bless u and keep doing good work using beautiful voice.
There was another scene in Badrinath ki dulhaniya that I found quite disturbing. This was where Badri was sexually assaulted by those goons in Singapore and that scene was meant to be a comic relief!!! Their friends laughed!! I mean what was wrong with the writers/directors, it was 2017 bro!!
Matlab kooooooocccccccchhhh bhi 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Lol... Salman slaps Karishma (Dulhan hum le jayenge), no problem to Indian audiences! 😂 where as Shahid slaps Kiara (Kabir Singh), oh God such toxic masculinity, misogynist etc 😂😂  We Indians are certified Hypocrites 🙏
The beginning clip of Irrfan sir took me back to watch his Collab video with AIB &quot;The party song&quot;<br>And it&#39;s still fresh in my head.
Hiya !!! I m one of ur subscribers and I never miss a video.. I need ur help!! Can u please tell<br>Me when n where can I watch Aamis Assamese movie on which u made a video already. I m waiting for that movie to come on digital platform but till now there is no luck. Ur video made me wonder what exactly wud b the execution of the stuff u have told in the video.I m sure u will help me out with this.. thanks a lot..
Body shaming is in that song too...Ho Nahi Sakta from Diljale, staring Ajay Devgn and Sonali Bendre, everyone mercilessly treats that girl like a crap and Ajay runs away from her.
You speaking way and thinking way is fabulous sir 💜🌼🌼
Damn!!! What an amazing video!!!
Not worth watching
One of your bkwas videos
😂😂😂
Kurtoos nahi.... Kartoos.... कारतूस
These retards in the comments are talking about Badri but did you not see Blackface in the Sanjay Dutt movies? Are y&#39;all factually blind? I don&#39;t see anyone talking about racism
Try hum tum cringe fest
In 2017 when i was 15 years old....I actuly Liked Badrinath ki Dulhania......Lol ...I am Glad my minset is not the same again....I cant watch most of Movies now a days of south too....earlier i was a big fan and bollywood ki to baat hi choror
90% of bhai films only shows how to insult women
In street dancer there is a scene where varun and shraddha fight with her family for freedom and Orthodox  mindset but the film also features item songs which only promote and work because of women objectification. Such hypocrisy.
That intro though xD
Varun chutiye ko acting aati hai kya jhatu ko....... Isse boht accha rajkumaarrao hai
If that stand is 6ft then Govinda will be probably 9 ft not Dadaji. <br>Stand floor is elevated from ground level and Dadji is standing on it.
overated pranesh gautam
Make a video on mysteries deaths in Bollywood plssssssssss
This is so sad.
People are talking here about how crap Badrinath was!!!!c&#39;mon guys It earned 100+ crores at box office....Fking 100 crs U all have watched have it in theatre
Hilarious😂
Please learn to pronounce Kartoos.
Kartoos kii Kaaaartooss.... <br>Love your video and always love your accent... <br>#@ Bhawesh comments
Cringe
Bhai video ke beginning mein rula diya yaar tune :(
Varun is David dhawan&#39;s son. Papa ne aisi movies banaye Hain toh beta influence hgya hoga😂 Varun is only here because of nepotism. The only good movie he did was october and badlapjr.
They are all double-faced, conveniently setting double standards for themselves and public.<br><br><br>They will have no issue, themselves objectifying women, abusing other genders and being racist for endorsement and movie making, but when it comes to themselves, they go all the way from twitter to instagram to facebook to blogs about how INTELLECTUALLY UPRISEN these beings are.<br><br>When someone &#39;Black&#39; dies in America, their hearts cry here in India, and they will go on to flashing &#39;Black Lives matter&#39; this life matters, and that life matters...<br><br>But so many among them, are struggling to keep up with Life itself and those LIVES do not matter to these guys?<br><br>Hypocrisy at best<br>Each and every Bollywood Family!<br><br>Period!<br><br>Bachhans<br>Kapoors<br>Khans<br>Bhatts<br>Chopras<br>Mukerjis<br><br>Seriously, everybody is nothing but a piece of shit. We really need to just watch &#39;GOOD CONTENT&#39;<br>Let content alone sell<br>No biggie&#39;s name associated to it shall matter to us &#39;THE AUDIENCE&#39; &#39;THE BUYERS&#39;<br><br>AND for a matter of time let&#39;s just shun each nepo product away, no matter how great actors or directors they are, if even after getting so much, being at that position they have no tongues to support the truth, then give them not even a PENNY MORE from our pockets.<br><br>Shunned guys, you all are shunned.<br>And as a content reviewer it shall be your duty, to promote only good content and not fall prey to any of the promotional tactics by these PR machinery
when same thing is shown in fast and furious 9 ...you say ...wow...great film... hypocrisy
Being Football Fan, I got goosebumps when he surprisingly mentioned CR7 . 🤩<br>And definitely, the Kick and the goal always gives goosebumps!
Bro watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty4dLUkAEEY">https://youtu.be/Ty4dLUkAEEY</a>. It will blow ur mind 😂
“kartoos” - pronounced as Kaartoos - means ammunition
I dunno but his voice is very similar to shayan from buzzfeed
This is so far the most intellectual channel I&#39;ve visited ...... Keep up the great. Work , Our country&#39;s youth really needs this kind of mindset👍🙏
Matlab kuch bhi. First ask for freedom of expression and then get offended!
My Jammy Pants, analyse yourself also for a change 😂😂 it is pronounced as Car - Toos कारतूस (cartridge). Not Kerr- toos
Well the girl was wrong too. Not that the abduction was justified. But he should have filed a case of fraud against her under civil law that would buy her an imprisonment of few years and also force her to return the amount while obviously putting the guy who married her sister behind bars too. So much that was objectionable. Man being molested taken as a joke was the most serious of them all.
Sir a video on hinduphobia on Bollywood.<br>Don&#39;t say you can&#39;t find any cause it will be tough to choose for me.
करतूस ❎<br>कारतूस  ☑️
I fell asleep  through the entire duration of this Badrinath ki dulhania, it was just so boring
Hindi kahan se sikha??? Kuuurtoooossss snsjsksksj
Am i the only one who didn&#39;t see any problem with the paresh rawal scene i mean who would want they&#39;re daughter to marry a gay guy??
can u make a video on how racist bollywood is with sikh characters movie like kuch kuch hota hai how they showed small sikh kid and that 12 baje character i know how i as a only sikh boy suffered and eveyday get bullied by others because of different identity
I think the whole &quot;Humshakals&quot; movie should have been in the video.
करतूस 😆😆😆😆😆
I hadn&#39;t observed these...damn
Most of the bollywood movies represent rascism!
Cant agree with your last choice..those scenes were a part of that characters journey from a misogynistic idiot to learn to respect women..thats the character arc..u cant take a scene out of the context of the whole movie and put it on trial..sometimes movies have to show terrible stuff to hold a mirror..as long as the movie isnt glorifying or justifying it..this movie wasnt doing any of that..
In the recent protests against racism in the US a new article highlights how Brown people, aka Indians have been mostly silent.
Rajni will bicycle-kick anyone that tells him &#39;yeh scene kuchh zyaada ho raha hai&#39;
Oh firangi, u r pronouncing kartoos wrong. It is called Kaartoos, meaning bullet in hindi
I remember varun and karan making fun of kangana on coffee with karan and then both of them hosted filmfare and did a special segment on feminism.
I think you failed to understand what movies are. These movies are made for entertainment purposes and not to find logic. Govinda&#39;s movie copied from Lier Lier. Dont you think Jim Carry&#39;s behavior in that movie would be contempt of court? Foreigners find it stupid when our Bollywood actors and actresses start dancing on the songs. Who does this in real life? Its movie, take it lightly.
Regressive movies and no one is going to talk about Kabir Singh?
I happened to see a kollywood movie (dubbed in hindi) on TV couple of days back. There is scene at the end where a plane is about to crash in mid air. There about 5 to 6 people and one dog in the plane and just one parachute. <br><br>Two uncles jump using the single parachute. Rest of the people and the dog sit in yellow raft and jump out of the plane in mid-air. The raft lands on water and all float safely to the shore.<br><br>There were couple of other scenes too<br><br>All I could think was this is perfect for a Matlab Kuch bhi episode!!!!
After seeing all your videos, I can safely say that Karishma Kapoor was the star of women-getting-harassed-and-falling-in-love.
I like ur content.....but isn&#39;t badri ki dulhania actually a realization of what u r referring here to be problematic ...towards the end of the movie.
Jammy it&#39;s Kartoos, not Kartoos.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=209">3:29</a> I guess Paresh Rawal is right. Kon apni behan-beti ki shaadi gay k sath karega.
Bhai you want increase your subscriber more, make video in hindi, 100% work. Lakhon ki baat free me...
I think Badri&#39;s character and his family are purposely made to be a nasty patriarch orthodox. Whatever Badri did like stalking, kidnapping her into the car was thought to be acceptable because he lives in a house where &quot;&#39;men can do everything&quot;. But his journey in Singapore  becomes a turnover of his character arc when he realizes that whatever he did was wrong. <br>Good content btw! The other movies in this list are just unbearable!
i didn&#39;t watch Gulabo Sitabo but in some teaser some lady says to amitabh&#39;s character &#39;tumhari bhi umar ho gyi hai, jao jaake marr  jao&#39; this was showed in a funny way but it isn&#39;t funny at all..
So Kartoos did blackface
LoL
Please review this movie on Zee5 Chintu ka birthday. Please share what you feel about the movie. I think Vinay Pathak has done a good job.
Arey apart from his content, can we say that Jammy Pants is really so handsome???
There were so many things with Badrinath that was an issue. I still can&#39;t understand why KJO would produce/make such movies. Like why?
Very good video...As usual....! Just one thing it&#39;s  कारतूस।
Reminder that in mr.india in the song hawa hawai, they did blackface.
3 cheers for Jammy&#39;s pronunciation
Well said dude👏👏👏 you need to leave your brains behind at home before going to watch these Bollywood movies 🙄 that’s why I never watch these lame nonsensical Bollywood movies at all🤣🤣🤣
This was a good review. At this point I feel like all Hindi movies are either very sexist or racist.
Kuurtoooooossssss😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
don&#39;t follow this channel... this guy Jammy Pants is Librandu...
कारतूस हे करतूस नहीं
La**e ka Bollywood
,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bhai bhai bhai it&#39;s not करतूस it&#39;s  कारतूस means bullets
Salman karisma clip... Omg really ...Thanks you bro to bring this out...I&#39;ll.share this to.all.grps
Bhai sahee mai Kuch bhe 🙆
lol..asian guys think they did a big favour on girls by not doing anything wrong to the girls..OK!
Bhai करतूस नहीं कारतूस....
When we use today&#39;s&#39; yardstick to measure yesterday, it tends to disregard the process of evolution our societies go through. And that I feel is the problem with video at least with the kuch bhis from yester- years. Twenty years from today one might be amused at the fact that the whole world went on a lock down for Corona Virus. But today, its our reality.
Badrinath ki Dulhania is such a crap movie, where they use music and emotions to persuade us to feel bad about a hero who is a physical abuser.<br>And there are people who ACTUALLY LIKED the movie!!<br>Same for Kabir Singh
The ad that came after the video was.... Seventeen&#39;s Left and Right!!!!....how could I skip??<br>Oh.....nice video👍
Abe gawaar...  Kartoos 😆 pronounce krna seekh le. KAARTOOS (meaning bullet)
Phle toh useless tha hi but old Bollywood was classy with sense and moral
jammy ! like literallyy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=127">2:07</a> the JTBC (kdrama channel tune ) hahahahahahaah rofl ! i thought  i clicked on a kdrama ! i cant stop laughing ! lmao
My first comment from channel
Kartoos or kurtus
Baat nahi bani this time bro
This guy as far as I can remember praised badri ki dhulania shit and also stupid nepo kids acting why sudden change of heart I wonder
I don&#39;t think that Badrinath deserves a mention in this list. The movie was an attempt to show how regressive our society is even today. The same Badri confronts his father in the end and says how can you teach your kids to murder someone. He also feels proud for Vaidehi for what she achieves. She does not fall for him because he stalked her, she falls for him when he becomes a changed man.
What&#39;s your problem to speak in Hindi<br>All the people watching your channel are indians.
There is nothing shocking. People buy into what is on their level easily. Why try to upgrade someone’s intelligence when you can just sell, sell and sell!
Salman and karishma scene really problematic...<br>it shocked me even while i saw it first<br>The problem of  Indian&#39;s being obsessed with fair/dark... ridiculing dark people... stalking....has been embedded quite alot by the cinema..<br>imagine .. repeating &quot;the same story&quot; for years and years...it does get hammered to our consciousness..agree or not..but films alone can play a huge role in which we perceive the world...<br>so all those people who say it&#39;s just a movie...can suck it..
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=370">6:10</a> buddy its pronounced KAARTOOS NOT KARTUS
Bhai you have too much time during the lockdown to notice such details 😉😁
Tried and Refused: Extra Woke version
its not like they don&#39;t realise the issue in dialogues or script.. they simply don&#39;t care, as long as they get profit.. and why not, audience claps on these scenes...<br>and the most ironic thing is that these scenes are passed by the sensor board, which will in order to fullfill the quota will cut the scenes from other movies where some scenes are logical and important as a part of script..
Nice observation!
Only here for Sidharth Shukla
TRIED AND REFUSED FACE
Salman Karishma scene is 🤮
What is Currrtooos? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I&#39;ve been watching you for so long...so long and never missed even one video...keep up the good work 🙏<br>PS. Love your English vocab 😉
Royal rumble!! 😁😁
Nice observation
Hiiii
The Gangs of Wasseypur dialogue was actually put backwards:-<br>&quot;India k log ch**iye hai. Tabhi humaare cinema itna ch**iya hai&quot;<br><br>If audience doesn&#39;t change, nothing will. Boycott commercial Bollywood! Seriously people..
CR7 😅🤣😂
Review DARK. pls
I Like how he started the video with an aib clip..<br>MAJOR THROWBACK !!!!
I don&#39;t Agree with You regarding Badrinath ki Dulhania
Stalking is ok! As long as respect hai.
David Dhavan movies were always crap, i still have no clue why and how they ever got not just made, released but were actually biggest hits of those times-it says a lot about the intellect of Indian viewers. And then now Varun playing all those David&#39;s poor taste characters.
To be very honest. I appreciate the work done by Bollywood. But I haven&#39;t watched a single film since Chichhore. And I probably won&#39;t be watching any more of Bollywood. Even if these people change from tomorrow. Im not interested. People in India talk about the shit humour of the Series &quot;Friends&quot; but don&#39;t realise they watch all this year long and don&#39;t give a damn about what they are implying from that storyline. Wanna give that thappad from Kabir Singh to all those people who liked the movie. Love..
PLZZ watch Malayalam movies there is only reality. Malayalam movies have no such scenes# kuch bhi.
Make more of this
This is a most problematic video I have watched on your channel..I think you are certainly doing more research without facts..
i think u should also have included your man crush ranbir kapoor besharam
i honestly think <br>varun dhawan is a good actor but being david dhawan&#39;s son masala over the top genre is in his blood
Lol even the first few seconds of Irrfan Khan made me laugh. This legend is absolutely hilarious without even trying to be. So sad that we lost him so soon. Rest in peace legend.
bhai tu kabhi punjab yahan pe bande tab tak peecha nahi chodte jab tak ladki set nahi hoti ya uski shaddi nahi hoti
Plz suggest good movies be it be in any language any “wood”.
Just this..🤣🤣🤣🤣
Loved this one...
Please make a video on best Bollywood dream crossovers
Hey I really love your videos you are doing a good job.. I have a request that can you please review the scifi German webseries &quot;Dark&quot; as your motto is to promise a good content to be consumed by the mass so do give it a try
Pronunciation me itni over acting karta hai ye banda....
You think this absurd? Just watch comedy circus where kapil sharma and sweta tiwari and shumona makes lots of sexist, color, sexuality jokes.. And judges like sohail and archana laughing hysterically.. Please make a video of this too
In one movie of akshay kumar he always says सुहागरात सुहागरात and paid to  juhi father to touch her
Please do a video on the 5 best and worst performances by Kareena Kapoor Khan. That would be fun to watch!!
irfan khan😢
Video k baad pata chala ki ye movies or characters bhi copied the😐
Well that hero who kicks the bomb is rajnikant he can do anything just read about him😂😂
waiting for the time when ppl could just watch movies and realize they are not real. They can show anything in the movies, it is upon the viewers what they grab from it.
What bollywood given us...<br>Homophobia<br>Colour Racism
You can also open a hindi treid and refused cahnnel for indian audiences🤗
We always criticize these filmmakers but then make such movies into 100 crore blockbusters. The problem is us not them.
There was a scene in the movie called aa abh laut chalein starring aishwarya and akshay khanna where akshay khanna leaves his current gf for aishwarya just bcoz her current was modern and lived life on her term and chose aishwarya coz she was simple indian girl who would listen to everything he says
Thanks 🙏😍
Bhai, movie ke naam thik se bol lo. Kartoos is pronounced as &quot;kaar-toos&quot;
Bro it&#39;s pronounced as &quot;Car Tooz&quot; not &quot;Karrtooz&quot;.
You really have some issues with govinda...<br>Why don&#39;t you watch your favourite nepokid Hrithik
Sidharthshukla
The way you said kartoos is da shiz
Do a video on nepotism that went right from the likes of rd burman kishore kumar indira Gandhi etc
I love kuch bhi episodes
Jab tak India me cinema Ka keera katega, aadmi tatti ko hi Sona dilse manega.
Can u make a vedio about anime in india
The only good thing in badrinath ki dulhania was the zest of alia bhatt to build an identity apart from being someone&#39;s wife. The fact this is a bollywood movie and she runs away just for her career and future is progess.
His &#39;kuchchh bhi&#39; is just love.. Awwhhh
Pls, can we get some Hollywood review and recommendation
Fun fact: if u use these illogical scenes in Hollywood. U may be banned 😂.
Varun Dhawan is shit, he thinks Dilwale to be as good as Inception, so we should know his standards.
Ok we know stalking is inappropriate. However don&#39;t you think alia&#39;s character could have just refused to marry him in the first place rather running on the wedding day itself.
dil chahta hai marked the end of these films .  Maang me sindoor is no longer dialogues in todays films
They Just Thought They Can Fool Audience As Much As They Want But We As Viewers Also Evolved!!!
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=91">01:31</a></b> it&#39;s WWE, Double E 😂<br>No offense please, it sounds like double E
Ramadhir ne sahi hi Kaha tha <br>Desh main jab tak cinema hai tab tak log chutiya bante rahenge
Sorry Jammy, l might being judgemental bt when some the words you pronounce in Hindi, the pronunciation is jarring..<br>In last vidoe it was Raaj-tarangini (that too &#39;ण&#39; at the end) , not Raaj-taraaangeeni..<br>In this video, it&#39;s Car-toos, not krtoos..<br>We learn English from you.. Hope you didn&#39;t get offended.
The dumbest thing is to find logic in bollywood movies..😂😂
They also show in movies that if girl get harassed by goons then she&#39;ll expect from her male partner to beat the shit out of them alone  which is the most stupidest thing..<br>Do you remember the &#39;NIRBHAYA girl&#39; she was with her male friend but that didn&#39;t change anything... <br>Men are not macho man or Iron Man.<br>In reality, These incidents are so scary for both men and women.. and they show in every 2nd film that it&#39;s so easy to get out of these situations... <br>People lose their lives it&#39;s not heroic at all..
3 foot ka katghara not 6 he said. You ride a motorbike, not drive. It is not kar-toos, it is pronounced kAArtoos. And that yellow dress on that African girl legit looks good. She carries the indian wear well.
bollywood is garbage
It is कारतूस😂
Thank God I never watched zero and Student of the year yet 🤣
Hey Bud Don&#39;t you think that in Badrinath Ki Dulhania though it was showing the darker sides and this kind of things may happen in some areas but at last they just break this mentality of Women Exploting Which according to me  is A Right Way To Break.
Bollywood has always been problematic and what&#39;s really sad is that audiences liked those films.
Pls make a review on perfect Blue
Salmon boy&#39;s and Rajanikant&#39;s movies are always been shit
I always find that your videos are good and clean but,...... In this I have two objections - one indian movies are still needs to change......1)  And homosex topi or about Govinda movie it is shown as it was in that point of time.....,......2)  and second thing------  Ali is broken Varuna&#39;s heart and left him after she used him to get  to  her sister&#39;s wedding and &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;most importantly  we always what to change in our men BUT we forgot our parents&#39; are responsible for over man in families....... .... The family influence will be there , and it&#39;s ok to show practical thinking ( I know it is not acceptable) experiences...... Yes I am not ok with the car and kidnapping ..... As a story she knows how much he loves her and what he did for her ..... But always finding mistakes is not good...........
Cartoos 🤣🤣🤣
It is not kartoos it is spoken as kaartoos
That scene in Badri MADE the movie for me. He grew up in a environment so toxic that he was sent to her KILL her for what she did. If he didn&#39;t do something drastic like what he did in that scene his character wouldn&#39;t have believable. Plus that&#39;s the scene that made his conscience kick in and he realises what he did was terrible and that there is something drastically wrong in his upbringing.<br><br>The only problematic scene in that movie was the potential rape scene because they used male rape as punchline.
Kartus nahi it&#39;s kartooooos jammy
Sirrrrrr review rasbhari nooo!!!!!plssss
I understand some of kuch bhi scenes... But disagree with Badrinath.... Why can&#39;t he say that. According to Badrinath kissing his girlfriend is also too much crossing the line, for him such a statement is possible. Badri is not a polished person grown with city values. But he eventually changes. That is all about the movie.
Please support this channel !🙏
Bhai kartoos nahi its kaartoos. Tujhe hindi nai aati kya?
Bollywood doing blackface.. why doesn&#39;t this even surprise me anymore
Bhai yeh fit tuber ki awaaz lag rahi hai
make video in hindi if you want more subscriber
Bhakk Yaar, badrinath ki dulhaniya kitni bhe chu movie ho but woh Shaadi(bhaagne) se pehle durwyavhar nahi kiya keh raha hota hai... Wrong interpretation
The names itself puts me off..Humpty..Badri.Glad i dnt see them.
Salman khan scene was absolute correct u take it on wrong side u should watch that scene for several times so u can know the deep msg in it, stop being neha dupia
Just a correction- Kartoos is pronounced as kaartoos
Lingaaa🥵😖...in the theater I was like 🙀
Please watch &quot;Krishna and his Leela&quot; , a brilliantly written and acted Telugu film! It is released in Netflix❤️
My fav part is kuchh bhi gif of Sidharth Shukla
Kartoos ni.. kaaartoos😂. It means bullet in haryana and UP
These kinds of things consciously and subconsciously effects persons
I don&#39;t agree with the point of badrii ki dulhaniya?
I liked when u talked in smile while explaining dumb sceane💓
bro for well being of your channel, you should move on. we moved on, stop making content on bollywood.
Shows the mentality, Salman Khan toh hai hi MC.
*कारतूस
Also don&#39;t try to navigate the Common Women/Men by navigating thru color,creed &amp; caste happened in past, just because U can&#39;t do any social nepotism /social problem currently.
hey do you think that if india tries to make indian version of big bang theory would it work <br>though Ssr would have been the best choice but still can you review that show
Though I was a regular person to watch ur videos...  Now I believe, u are with the Upper caste in Bollywood...  if you understand Caste system in India, U will know what I&#39;m taking about. Pls. don&#39;t use anything in the name of Sushant SR or the sympathy in his death to promote ur channel...<br>to promote arseh*les  in BOLLYWOOD ... I Believe U are no different...
Kartoos....or kaaartooos
Kaartoos= bullet
Excellent work......! 🤣🤣🤣that’s Bollywood for you larger than life. But I still love Indian movies.♥️
Why big creators are not making video on SUSHANT&#39;S murder now??suicide ki baat sun k sb kud parey thaey ab kyo chup h..if we won&#39;t raise our voice then the person behind it will bully more people
Bro plz review (Kadakh) by Rajat Kapoor .<br>On Sony liv
Bhai... Sab thik hai... But its not said &#39;kartoos&#39; it is &#39;kaartoos&#39;... Bullet. 😁
I am dump☹️
Varun Dhawan is actually talented, but his script choices are horrendous.
Thank God I&#39;m not Indian
I also did not like the scene in Love per Square foot. Vicky&#39;s female boss drunkens him then lies that he got her pregnant. That was cringeworthy
Matlab kuch bhi is back
And how did the scene of Badrinath ki Dulhania , where they make fun of Varun Dhawan after he is sexually assaulted, failed to make the cut? I guess , for woke people, male sexual harrasment is not a thing.
So true... I never understood why they even tried to make a movie like Badrinath... Also, one quick question, aren’t all the actors given their scripts to practice before they perform. Then how come they never object at the same time when they are about to speak in front of the camera. “Kuch bhi”. <br>Anmol, my husband and myself love all your videos. My husband introduced me to your channel and I have been in love with it. We always see your reviews before we see any movies/series. Thank you so much! <br>Always happy to see all your videos. 😊
Everything was fine and then he pronounced kurtoos... Why man why?
Please make an honest review of the web series &#39;Rasbhari&#39;...most of the reviews are biased...I want an unbiased review from you...please🙏🙏🙏
The pronunciation of movie &#39;Kartoos&#39; my! my!  😂 😂 😂    &#39;&#39;कारतूस&#39;&#39;    ≠    करतूस  😂 😂
Rajnikant doesn&#39;t do stunt. He stands &amp; stunt does itself.
Kaartoos कारतूस*
The dislikes r from sallu fans😂🤣 cuz they believe &quot;bhai ne bola toh sach hi bola hoga&quot; 🤣🤣🤣
So our society is triggered by These concepts only. Humare to CONCEPTS and BASICS hi kharab hai. ;) :P<br>PS: It&#39;s &quot;Kaartoos&quot; sir. <br>Spelled as Kartoos
Anupam Khair’s character in Dulhan hum le jayeng reminds me of real life Karan Johar( the Bollywood mafia queen) lol
Its not KRTUS its Kaaartoos. The fatter red bullet used in shot guns.
The way you pronounced &#39;Kartoos&#39; was so cute. 😂
Yup we had our own chu problem in Bollywood ; n still facing.I hope people learn their lesson n invest in better artists and logistic script , rather going for the ever flowing drainage and garbage heap bollywood actors n actresses n their unrelatable n irrational film stories.
I&#39;ve been a long time viewer of yours Jammy n all of a sudden it struck me..if everything were so logical, correct n precise then maybe you n me wouldn&#39;t be here today. You making these videos n me watching them up! Just a thought ..keep up d good work dude.
Chutiya jaato jaaammmmyyyyy paaannnntsss
Racism is not an issue in asian counteries but only applied to white people 😂 poor white people
Bhai it&#39;s कारतूस
Silent movies ke daur wapis aayenge dekh lena.
No its 6foot its on a height ,  nd for any act in court you need to prove it was for a proper reason
Sidharth shukla gifi mast❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=375">6:15</a>. It&#39;s pronounced Kaartoos, not kartoos.
Very relevant. Well done.
Badri was a v nice movie with v relevant and important social message.I loved it
Its kaartoos in pronunciation not kartus
You&#39;ve come a long way from calling rape &quot;force making love&quot; Jammy. Good man!
After seeing 415 dislikes on this video. <br><br>*Me:- Kaun hai yeh log? Kaha se aate hai?
Didn&#39;t even need to watch the whole video. Just watched Irfan Khan&#39;s scene and LIKED !
The best part was sidharth shukla clip
Badrinath ki dulhaniya was sersly unbelievable. Like was it approved? Piece of shit movie.
got to hear the &quot;matlab koooch b&quot; after a looong time 😂😂🙏
1 thing common in each movie that these are bakwaas 🙄
Why people yell bolly bolly bolly <br>Can&#39;t they sai hindi cinema
I so felt the scene in badri to be extremely regressive and don&#39;t forget  he tried to suffocate her too!
Again another worst video,bro I just don’t understand why are you trying to make contents for views,if you are so much talented then please make a movie which should be funny,sensible and have all the correct elements in it.The thing its a movie just our day to day life where nothing is perfect and the makers aren’t telling that it is perfect,they are showing you a story and it’s on you how you take it.Sadly you are stupid enough to take a movie in this way and later you blame nepotism for the mismanagement of talents or you all ask for content.If you have real guts please make a content a real content according to you,I am just hating your videos day by day,don’t judge others look at yourself
Hey Jammy, I am not into movies much but I never fail to watch ur reviews bcz I find them very genuine and unbaised.  keep it up! 😊One of movies I want u to put forward is &quot;Chingaari&quot; Starring Sushmita sen, Ila Arun, Mithun Chakraborty.  Hopefully, u will read my comment. 😊
There is a marathi movie called Ajoba Vayat Aale..If u want to see how bad a scriptwriting can be watch the climax scene of this movie..a girl is being raped by college guys..when the police come there the old man(Ajoba) who saves her asks the police not to punish the boys but...Sajaa deni hai toh iss jaisi ladkiyon ko do jo aise kapde pehnti hai..and the worst thing somebody could ever say..isse dekh ke toh mujh jaise buddhe ke dil mein bhi tamanna jaag jaaye raste par kapde phadne ki...damn I just can&#39;t hear something worse..
Bhai roaster ban ja bhut scope hai
This is what we call a review/reaction channel
Fight or flite mode me  80 year old lady bhi bhagegi.lagta he hamne galat science padh he aur govinda ne alag science padhi he
omg! the salman and karishma scene ew ew ew! i never saw that one before, it’s disturbing 🥺🥺🥺🥺
It&#39;s Car-Toos.
The intro of irfan sir was daamn hilarious dude! We surely lost a gem.  😭
The list was right, though it missed many. One of the scenes I remember watching this video, gabbar is back was not a bad movie I Must say, but that scene where shruti just deliever&#39;s a child in a car without being a doctor, and the reason she gave is that she had researched on google😂😂😂
Kaartoos you piece of shit. Kurtoos dafuq?
करतुस 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>Kartoos= कारतूस (Bullet)
Bawa one small complaint at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=365">6:05</a>. The name of the movie is Kaartoos and not Kartooos 😂😂 had watched this movie in local cable and was overwhelmed by Sanjay&#39;s personality and Manisha&#39;s sensuousness
Years back when I saw Judwaa on TV, I knew that I would not like such cinema. But when Judwaa 2 released, it became a commercial success ! WHY ??!! A person with a sound mind would not throw money like that !!
These type of things happens in reality and movie is movie .
It would actually be pronounced Kaartoos instead of Kartoos, nice video though
The time when Varun Dhawan was praising his work in Badri in a roundtable with Akshay Kumar, Irrfan Khan, Ayushmaan Khurana and Rajkumar Rao. Like truly matlab kuch bhi?!
Hey... A video idea - how Himesh who was a RAGE for years and was screwed over by T-Series
करतूस nahi hota bhai कारतूस hota hai.
A video about some good actors who could have gotten better movies or characters but disappeared because of nepotism or some other reason. Example Akshay Khanna. You’ve mentioned him earlier may be more examples like him.
once a legendary said:<br>Jab tak Hindustan mai cinema hai log chutiya bante rahenge
Lots of Love and Respect from PAKISTAN Brother<br>-stay safe everyone
Sorry but its कारतूस not करतूस
The clip of Irrfan Khan 💔 still not over it
Seriously Bollywood Is World Of Double Standard Where On One Hand They Always Raise Their Voice Against Stalking &amp; Racism &amp; On Other Hand They Are Promoting &amp; Glorifying All These Things In Their Movies Seriously That&#39;s Why We As Audience Just Don&#39;t Consider Them As Role Models Of The Society For Me The True Role Models Are Soldiers, Doctors &amp; Cops Who Are Truly Taking Care Of Us In This Lockdown Period While Sacrificing Their Own Personal Lives
5 times where Bollywood celebs totally killed it with their savage replies to the interviewer trying to roast India.
Seriously I Hate This Person Shashank Khaitan Especially After He Ruined Sairat Movie In Garbage Hindi Remake Film Called Dhadak Seriously Even His Last 2 Movies Were Utter Shits &amp; Waste Of Time<br>I Am Proud Of Myself Of Being  Hater Of David Dhawan As All His Movies Are Waste Of Time As It Only Promotes Only All Regressive Things In Society In Name Of Entertainment
You are great dude
Varun dhawan is an actor should be part of this series.
Star kids and other manipulative actors: <b>promote racism , sexism , misogyny , xenophobia , homophobia , transphobia , and bigotry</b><br>Critical and upstanding audience members: <b>rightfully accuse star kids or said actors for abusing their power</b><br>Same actors: STOP CYBER BULLYING !!! WOMEN EMPOWERMENT !!! INCLUSIVITY !!!
There is a difference between Reel life and Real life and tbh Bollywood is beyond everything 🤣🤣🤣
JP can you start a series on comparing movie based on same genre, plots, same series or prequal sequel..like Singham, Golmaal, Krishh or plots like Hum Apke hai kaun and Nadiya k paar...etc.
Seriously yaar, our Indian society is so regressive. I can remember the day, vividly when my ex dumped me coz of my caste. She said, she didn&#39;t wanna marry a guy, who belongs to a caste which is lower/different than hers. &amp; this happened with me in April 2020. I mean WTF. 😔😞
You sound like boring bro, you need some energy in presenting... Everything is fine
One of the few channels that believes in quality over quantity ❤️
Jemmy&#39;s content is definitely improving day be day.. keep up the good work..
I&#39;ve only been able to get through Badrinath Ki Dulhania once. I watched it almost a full year after its initial release, but I can&#39;t rewatch it because it&#39;s so problematic. That scene in particular that you discussed is what destroyed the movie for me, and I will never be able to get behind it, as much as I love Varun and Alia&#39;s jodi. You&#39;re telling me she chooses to marry him at the end?? In a ROMCOM released in 2017??? Nope. No way.<br><br>And while I haven&#39;t seen Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge, as soon as the Vengabus song started in that clip, there&#39;s no way I could take that scene seriously. That song is nothing but a joke in the States. Not surprised that David Dhawan used it.
Sir Its KAARTOOS :D Not Krtus. BTW loved the video
Always awesome
Point bro
Its kaartoos not kartoos😑🔪
If any of these scenes were in a Hollywood movie...those actors , actresses and filmmakers would be CANCELLED by now! But here in India they are still enjoying their celebrity status and actually defend such shit...<br>Guys we need to call out these actors like Varun Dhawan, Govinda, Salman Khan, Karishma Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Anupam Kher for doing such scenes in the first place...and then directors like David Dhawan. They really need to be called out
कारतूस not करतूस
Pretty sure it&#39;s pronounced &#39;Kaartoos&#39; 😅
That karishma and salman disco scene had all of a sudden struck means I was like matlab kuch bhi...a few days later this scene features in this series, well done bro
कारतूस है करतूस नहीं
Anmol&#39;s kooooch bhi is so lovely
करतूस 🤣
Interesting thing is back in day, we used to lol while watching these Govida, Salman, Sanjay Dutt movies.
Bro you need to work on your pronunciations. It&#39;s not करतूस , it&#39;s कारतूस . It pricks when you don&#39;t get it correct.
kartus nhi saale,,, its pronounced as <br>Kaaartoooos
Linga _ it&#39;s rajni ,he is superstar means all the super hero in one ...it&#39;s rajni ...
Kartuusss nahi<br>kaartoos....bullet
It&#39;s not करतूस। it&#39;s कारतूस। idiot

Badrinath ki dulhaniya 2016 me aayi thi 🙄
I am requesting you again. Please Please Please you should really really really watch the movie &quot;Sanam Harjai (1995)&quot; for your next &#39;Matlab Kuch Bhi&#39; Episode
@triedandrefusedproductions - please make a video on &quot;Movie that saved careers&quot;
Mtlb kuch bhi
Jammy u better hv pointed out the scene from badrinath ki dulhaniya where varun is sexually assaulted by men and people found it funny, that ws the most problematic. The scene u hv pointed out is not that matlab kuch bhi in its context.
What about kuch kuch hota hai? That entire movie is problematic, srk literally made stalking a trend why don&#39;t people point it out? He keeps doing the same
Well in the movie Garv, Anupam Kher (lawyer) was insulting Salman&#39;s sister, this angered Salman and this is why he started the fight.
Badrinath ki Dulhania is a movie that showcases our social evils, the movie doesn’t promote such evils. The climax shows how Badri goes against everything he was taught from his childhood and becomes a “modern mard” I don’t think the movie was problematic. Yes, the scene where he’s almost raped by goons and his friends laugh is very disrespectful. But other than that, the film consistently talks about breaking norms and is against sexism and misogyny
I never understood why would a director like Anand L. Rai would make a crap film like Zero... actually it was a complete zero.
Viiya itna achaa hindi bolte ho,toh video bhi hindi main banaya karo,toh aur jada log apse jur payenge ,apka contain bahut badia hota hain <a href="http://hamasa.it/">hamasa.it</a> is a request vaiiya.
Court waala drama Mera favorite hai 😂
I thought I was the only person who felt Badrinath was all about wrong treatment towards women,...
Lol!  I cant believe I watched these movies and actually enjoyed them at the time. 😂😂😂😂
Bollywood mostly copy krta hai Hollywood n foreigne ki kuchh acchi bhi seekh leni chahiye Bollywood ko. Nepotism nhi hai Hollywood me har movie ke liye sabhi ke liye role ke
Pls review &#39;your honour &#39;
why didn&#39;t you add Kabir singh? @triedandrefusedproductions
please review the 1997 ishq
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=275">4:35</a> what was that
I&#39;ve suggested a movie on your insta. Check your dms
Good video...should make more such videos
It is not करतूस  It is कारतूस
Please start a channel for us where we can learn English from you.
I think you are wrong about Badrinath ki Dulhania. The whole point of the character&#39;s regressiveness is to show how sexist beliefs and practices are perpetuated. When Badri says the line about not hurting her before, he&#39;s obviously referring to before she left him as it&#39;s made obvious by the context of the argument. Please stop ignoring proper context just for the sake of calling names.
It&#39;s Bollywood,ye Salman Jaise uncle ko Bhai kehte and 55 sal ko 16 sal ki ladki ke saath romance dikhate hai. And our audience is like vahhh. So logic to gaand me khusa ke aate hai log. Just like apni gaand marwane ke baad kisi actor ko kaam deta ja ,vaise hi 90% janta dimag ko ghar fek ke jaate hai. That&#39;s we never make movies like inception or interstellar. And forget about is Oscars ,ye to Indian awards bhi naa jite agar awards independent ho to.
its pronounced &quot; CAR TOOS&quot; not &quot;kertus&quot;
Yaar, I like my skin color, not too white, not too black.  I also like my straight hair - sorry I had to say this.  I consider it a poor joke to throw color on yourself which ever way - poor taste, wouldn&#39;t you say.  I liked the original &quot;Ek phool chaar kanre&quot; with Sunil Dutt and Waheeda Rehman, believe came from Hollywood.  Keep up your good work and thanks.
Matlab kuuuuuuch bhi 😂😂
Can you make a video on top comedians.. vintage comedians who used to laugh us without any vulgar words or actions.
if you dont like certain film just dont watch
The point about badrinath that you pointed out was not the actual problem, because being from a conservative family, let me tell you my brothers behave the same way, they will run after a girl, stalk her because they believe this is how love should be, typical govinda style. This movie showed that aspect, in the movie gradually varun Dhawan&#39;s character understands the concept of consent and respect woman. The main issue that I didn&#39;t like is the way they normalised the molestation of badri. Be it male or female, molestation rape should never be normalised, NEVER.
12 angry men
Please make a video on How worst is nepotism in Bollywood and how it impacted really and extremely talented artists and technicians I know many did it but I feel you&#39;ll present it in a different way
Bro you are revisiting badri ki dulhaniya ???? What&#39;s wrong with you 😂😂
Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt &gt;&gt; Both are chutyas !!!
Kuch bhi... This was quite hilarious...
बुरा मत मानो लेकिन होमो लोग ऐसे ही तो होते है जैसे दिखाते है मूवी में..मुम्बई में होमो लोगो ने मुसलमानो के लिए anti-caa मार्च किया था वाहा मैंने live देखा था इनको , सभी होमो लोग अमीरो की औलाद लग रहे थे और ऐसे ही कर रहे थे जैसे मूवी में दिखाया जाता है
Varunardo DiCaprio aka Sasta Govinda
It seems Not even a single scene either from Arjun Reddy or Kabir Singh still problematic to the creator🙄
Kooooch bhi😂😂
It&#39;s not krtoos ,it&#39;s kaaaartoos
Can you make a video on the highest profitable movies of every decade since 1970? Is it possible for you to do R&amp;D on how the movie was promoted during these years? In a speech, Anurag Kashyap said that he had to visit the different countries and give away free CDs &amp; DVDs of his movies. He just wanted the movie to reach out to the masses. So, why it happened? He answered that too.
This is the reason why so many people stopped watching Bollywood movies.
Pls watch CHOTE SARKAR starring Govinda n Shilpa... U will get a whole set of Matlab Kuch Bhi
And for that badrinath ki dulhaniya shit Varun Dhawan was on best actors round-table of that year with Paid nepogang media person Rajeev Masand 🤯🤯🤯🤯😂😂😂😂
How is this (Salman karishma scene) different from Kabir Singh&#39;s review by film companion which you criticized? These may be problematic to your sensabilities but not for that particular character in that particular story!! Isnt it?
varun dhawan + alia bhatt aur kya expect kar sakte ho
bro it pronounced  KAARTOOS... not ker-tus... :D
Ohh god... Your laugh is like cherry on cake.. Loved it😘
A lady whom i know took her family (=5yr old daughter, 7yr old son she n her husband) to &quot;Badrinath ki dulhaniya&quot; !!! I&#39;m still don&#39;t understand ki uske intension kya the!!!? That lil girl started twerking her waist after watching that movie 🤷
Toilet ek prem katha also has that whole song where Akshay Kumar keeps stalking and taking videos of Bhumi and the movie is considered a masterpiece???!!!
It&#39;s कारतूस not करतूस
You are absolutely right
Great work bro.<br>You won&#39;t believe,  this is the only channel I have subscribed on YouTube 😅
How many of you are subscriber of cinema beyond entertainment<br>I think he should collab with jammy
Sid bhai😂😂😂
Badrinath Ki Dulhania is a regressive movie in every fucking way!!<br>I think the script of this film was written way before even Varun &amp; Alia were born...but it took several years for the script to translate into a movie!!!
Its varun dicaprio Mann....thats inception level  shit..
Bro i watched every video of urs bt video me dialogue se jyada tumhari commentary hoti hai n thts irritates plzz work on this
Name it a series of matlab Kuch bhi 1,2,3 so on
I never miss one of your MKB episodes, but I worry about your mental health because you are forced to watch and re-watch this garbage so you can entertain us 🙏
JammyPants, whatever your name is, start watching movies like movies, to entertain and pass the time. If you want to start finding &#39;concept&#39; and true to life things then I think you are watching the wrong content. From the last few months, you are actually producing KUCCH BHI content now. Also, aajkal problem yeh hai ki the generation/people get offended by each and every little thing. And you seem to be in that category. Chill man. I think you should start watching Art Cinema or Documentaries now. Be cool man... waise hi jaise desh duniya mein pehle hi kum problems chal rahi hain
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=366">6:06</a> करतूस or कारतूस?<br>Your pronunciation is BIZARRE ....
That&#39;s why I watch Bollywood Movies only after watching review.
Kajol hair short- no attention<br>Applied nariyal tel and onion juice, got long hair and loads of sanskar-full attention <br>Happy ending! Attraction to keratin<br>Kkhh could have been best ad for mama earth onion oil
Bhai sidharth shukla ko dekhkar pura video dekha par tune dissapoint kardia.<br><br>Sid ka part aur jyada lamba hona chahiye tha😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🙂<br>Nahi toh varun ,Alia aur physicist ko kaun dekhega
The biggest problem is that when as a kid you watch these scenes they  dont look wrong. <br>Making bad look good seems to be Bollywood&#39;s specialty
I have been a fan for quite a long time... This video was very intriguing as well... Just one thing... Kartoos is actually pronounced as &quot;Car + tuz&quot;
Bhai hmare yha Aisa hi hota h 😁😁✌️
one more thing is KUCH BHI - this video.
Royal rumble hahaaa
Maximum big stars Tamil movies are shit and illogical. If anyone really want to explore south Indian cinema then they should watch small stars  Tamil movies and Malayalam ( realistic) movies.  Everyone already know the crap they produce in Telugu and Hindi action movies.

Till now i haven&#39;t even watch trailer of badrinath ki dulhani
Bhai woh KAARTOOS H....&#39;AA&#39; not Kartoos
I am here only to hear your english
Only Indians watch these rubbish
Well done! good exploitation of the nepo situation, just randomly questioning scenes in movies. Of course it is illogical but that shit happens and its a movie, becoming a saint to preach and teach doesn&#39;t work .The main point in movie is badri going out of way and letting the girl do her thing, but no ignore that and question the dialogue and taking it out of proportion stating it kuch bhi!. I am amused by you thinking you are a great critique in judging movies,<br>one time you say creative freedom of director or writer needs to be protected even without watching movies when there is a backlash and then post a video of something that you don&#39;t like and rub that to stupid people watching and get convinced that this is right and that is wrong. <br>I mean when do people fucking have their brains out and start thinking on their own. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes.Stop Judging by taking things out of context.
Can you make a video on “Product Placement “ in Bollywood movies
Boycott Alia Bhatt - dumb aunty
I understand the purpose of the video and have been following this series for like a year, but didn&#39;t it as good as the previous ones.
Plz review moothon (2019) it&#39;s on zee5 now... Attaching trailer.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRKTAYDaHzw">https://youtu.be/KRKTAYDaHzw</a>
@Tried&amp;Refused Production,<br>करतूस???<br>Even google hindi keyboard corrected it to कारतूस (when I typed Kartoos).<br>Are you sure you deserve to be critic to Hindi Cinema???<br>This happens when an english medium student, who does not hindi, decides to be critic to Hindi literature, or any other type of Hindi Art.<br>It shows that you did not even watch the movie (might not be worth even) before providing comments.<br>Hope in future, you watch the movie first and then plan to provide critic comments on that.<br><br>Seriously thinking of unsubscribe your channel.
This is real content..🔥 great work bro,
Actually many of us didn&#39;t even realised at that time that what we are watching is problematic in so many aspects. Ab to 2020 hai isliye smjh aa rha h
The MATLAB Kuch bhi for this month was superb
It&#39;s pronounced &quot;Kaartoos&quot; ..stress on The a
Kartoos? Or kaartoos?
Bhai ka level hi kuch aur hai 🤣🤣🤣
These things are called spoiling generation subliminals directly from the subcconcsious mind
Not kartoos it&#39;s kaaaaartoos
Salman whole life = MATLAB kuch bhi
I follow you since 1-1.5 years and I must say, you have a clear vision towards what&#39;s good and whats not. It&#39;s a kind of giving teaching lessons to the viewers. A moral teacher.. Keep up.
Whose voice is it ?......whoever it is . I love ur voice
Wtf is Kar tus.. Dude its called kaartoos..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=276">4:36</a> Matlab Kooch Bhi..... So cute!😁<br>Am I the only one who has a crush on him😶
It&#39;s not kartoos it&#39;s kaaartoos
This is going for many decades. The producers and directors be like &quot;agar bik rha hai toh hmlog yehi bechenge.&quot;
Matlab kuccch bhi 😂
Pls review moothon malayalam movie
Totally agree with you.
I think ur pronouncing Kartoos wrong
just fyi it is pronounced car-toos
As a lawyer I&#39;ve just given up on any portrayal of what goes into a court and the profession as a whole.... Hollywood doesn&#39;t do much better either hey
What in the hell the director and writers thinking while making this movie.....matlub kuch bhi...
Dude.. Thank you so much for this Kuch Bhi video..but considering the recent scenario after Sushant&#39;s demise I would like you to show the naked truth of Bollywood and nepotism. if not possible then I would to unsubscribe you and wish you all the best.. And would console myself that even the people who had the power were not able to take the stand. Good luck
NO, I don&#39;t agree with criticism on Badrinath ki Dulhania. I mean movie had a good social message on women empowerment and these regressive thoughts and actions were there but only to be condemned in the end. At the end of the day, these regressive thoughts does happen. Women who dosent obey social structures specially in villages does get harrased, raped and even hanged for their life choices. Don&#39;t believe me just open newspaper and see yourself.
lol still we the Indians are the one that makes these movies a few  crores of business because of stupid story line no logic and music dance and all. We are the one to blame for all these kuch bhi stuff....  so let us try to make the audience feel guilty for watching all the movies. Ohh by the way I have not watched a single one of those moves that you showed in this episode but I am guilty if watching some that was shown in some of your previous ones
Jab tak India me cinema hena tbtk log chutiyr bntr rhenge
I love the way you said with tricky laugh maine tumare saath kabi Durvehvar nahi kiya 😂superb👍
Salo ki pungi ab bajayengey ek bar theater kholney toh do...ek key baad ek movies na pitwayi to bolna...kiu bhaiyo merey saath ho? Sushant bhai key liye?
You can even make a series out of this topic😂
Testing of reflection !
Bollywood ka kuch nhi hoskta I have lost hope
Almost all court scenes in indian cinema are nothing but unreal and illogical... 🤦 The lead coming with the evidence right after trail when judge starts to read the verdict...
There is a tamizh film called vengai. Bakwas ka 2 and a half hour definition tha. Most of the scenes were keep on discriminating women.And a so called comic character God dammit
Your eyes need rest after seeing all these shit😂😂😂nice content indeed!!
Bro, you forgot Kabir Singh.<br>And the Govinda&#39;s scene was so funny yaar
That is why i dont watch bollywood movies.
Rajnikant chacha ko kabh tak wig pehna ke jawaan banate rahoge 😅😅
bhai itni purani movies mt deka kro
&#39;Kaar&#39;toos padh bhai. kurtoos nahi.
So what u want, production house should bring African musical band from Africa. Your entire video is 💩.
Its pronounced as CARtoos not kartoos.
The scene in Badrinath ki Dulhaniya where he gets molested by men and is laughed at, is absolutely despicable. It was supposed to be funny scene! What is funny about men being molested? Isn’t that the reason, men find it a lot more difficult to speak about such instances.<br>I have personally been molested twice in buses, and it’s not a good feeling. I never found the courage to address it or speak about it when it happened to me, because of the image we have created for men. It’s absolutely ridiculous. That scene angered me and made me so uncomfortable. It’s just a one off example.
Revisit Ready it has bizzare dialogues 🤣🤣
Rajnikanth 😆😆😆😆😆
Please create a video on  RAMA RAMA RE....kannada movie of 2016... it is a gem of a movie that no one has ever spoken about....
Dahej is not part of Skanskar.... You librandus have coined this term derogatory.<br><br>Work better on your scripts.<br><br>Dahej is lalach, not sanskar.
&quot;Sir ji, thoda zyada ho raha hai&quot;.
&quot;Sanjay Dutt being a bootleg version of Nicholas Cage&quot;<br>Lmao. That was next level
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=420">7:00</a> true ☹️

That Sanjay dutt and Manisha Koirala song was something else! Disturbed!!!!
Badrinath ki dulhania is completely shit
That was hillarious ....and we still think why indians still are homophobic or racist   and sexist
It&#39;s Kaartoos, not Kurtoos
There was a more problematic  seen in that movie where they normalize  male rape by making it a gag  ha matlab ladki k saat rape hua to buri baat hai pur ladke k saat hua to comedy
Do a review on dark
Brother it’s not kartuus it’s kaaartoos
Alia Bhatt is overrated. Period. Please make wise choices audience! 😕 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bannepotism">#BanNepotism</a> bolne se kya hoga?
The credit of rapes and stalking in India goes to Bollywood..... It’s fu****g brainwash 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Irfaaan sirr😭
I think to be a hindustani girl is itself a different struggle and if she belongs to small town then she had to face alot of question which are literally illogical
I have watched only few of David Dhawan movies but seriously in those movies they haven&#39;t treated girls with respect at all
About Badrinath ki Dulhania why&#39;s everybody talking about Varun Dhawan only? Alia Bhatt is equally dumb.
The problem with Linga movie is Rajinikanth&#39;s stardom.  Since people accept whatever rajinikanth do, the writers wrote most absurd scenes. Thankfully people rejected these nonsense scenes and loved the concept of movie.
You completely forgot a film called Kabir Singh.
These stupid masala movies are never realistic.
The stereotypes are created by Bollywood and slowly perception that of society gets changed.....
I think ur subscribers are so less <br>But after watching videos and reading comments I conclude quality matters not quantity😁😉
Rajnikanth ka chalta hai bro..😉
I revisited badrinath ki dulhania? <br><br>Daamn man the things u do,  the extent you go for content is just Wow 🤣
Actually in the last , the thing where one says &quot; aurat ko apni maryada nhee bhulni chahiye &quot;<br>That man is in negative role , and audience should get the point that it is a bad thing to do .<br>And stabbing in car is bad but you can&#39;t potray any protagonist with all ethics and moral because it would be exxageration .<br>Badri said that hum acche se behave kar rhe hai  is a good behaviour relatively as seen by him in that movie .
Its ‘कारतूस’ not ‘ करतूस’ !!!
The Linga scene lmao. How was that even fucking approved XDDDDD
Badri Was Average And Funny Until I Saw That Second Half! 😒
Irfan Khan in the beginning ❤❤😥 oh God please give him peace and happiness wherever he is. Amin
Another nice video mate. Can you do a video on a few actors who have struggled or did bit part roles on their way to stardom. Its fascinating to see the small roles Pankaj Tripathy had done.. And now where he has reached
it has no rules thats why it is cinema  u know ?
Tum bahot mast kaam karta hai mansookh bhai lol😂
Kartoos nhai bhai kaartoos😂😂
Bollywood logic ki ma chuda ta aa raha hai
I will never watch &quot;badri ki dulaniya&quot; , just bcoz of title.
Can you adress the rasbhari controversy .
<b>Please do a video where you show some movie where the whole plot just doesn&#39;t make sense</b>
Ese to bhai 90% Bollywood video me dalna padega  😂😂😂
I am really very thankful that you mentioned Badrinath ki Dulhania <br>The first time l watched the scene l felt very disturbing<br>It&#39;s good that you mentioned
Broooooo pls do Anime!!!!!!
If we judge yester years generation woth today&#39;s merit we soon will be ostracized by our future generation by their standards
I don&#39;t think watching movies is important ,  there are many good things to do in life
Nepotism gave us Arjun kapoor in big screen. Matlab Kuch viiii.....
Bro I have a legit question that why is your channel not growing like other YouTube channels in India? I am following you since 1 year and you have gained around 150k subscribers🙇
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=59">00:59</a> also enemy of state with will smith. Kyunki main jhut nahi bolta was combo of both movies
Kartoos=KAARTOOS<br>NOT KURTOOS<br><br>Means bullet
Kaaaartoos, not kartus 😅
I loved the intro. May he rest in peace
I am shocked how you have been a complete pseudo-feminist. Feminism means equality jammy, how could you skip badri&#39;s harassment sequence where everyone laughs at him for being harassed by a bunch of gay men on the streets of Singapore! You are equally misleading bro
You won&#39;t believe???? It is bollywood belive me we do believe 😜
I believe Rajnikanth (Thalaiva) has actually done it..<br>Jammy pants you should apologize 😂<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rajnifan">#RajniFan</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thalaiva">#thalaiva</a>
This type of scenes can be there in balakrishna movies
Dude they were really showing the real face of the society, they still do that, that is the reality, also in the end, Badri confront his father, Asking his father simple question &quot;Aisa koi sikhata hai apni Bache ko, Murder Karna&quot;. Badrinath ki dulhaniya was an honest and sarcastic approach to show the double standards of the sanskari society.
Kartooos or kaaartoos.
Cringy bollywood scenes...
It&#39;s कारतूस brother.
One day I will become mature enough to not laugh at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=276">4:36</a>
That salman and karishma scene could have been ayed out much better. Karishma&#39;s character in her anger and frustration accepted offer of a creep in a bar. Which is a mistake on her part. But salman&#39;s character didn&#39;t have to give her the sanskar speech. He could have slapped her after he helped her get rid of creeps and told her world is not all rainbows and sunshine  we need to stay safe so we need to watch out for creeps like that. But it turned into a stupid girls should not do this should not dance with strangers and all that bullshit. All the while salman also wanting the same thing.
<b>BOLLYWOOD MOVIES EXPLAINED IN TWO WORDS</b> ...- <b>Kuch bhi!!</b>
bhai wo car-toosh hai,.....
Sirji thoda jada hora hai🤣🤣
varun&#39;s just wannabe-govinda from late 80s and 90s. Even in his watchable movies like badlapur and october, his acting didn&#39;t tick at all. It was the story or co-actors who shined.He should rather produce or something.
For some I&#39;d agree, but for some I won&#39;t. Because its true! Indians do these <b>&#39;Matlab kuch bhi&#39;</b> kind of things in real!
I&#39;m so glad we share the same thoughts about badri and Dulhan hum le jayenge. Absolutely hate these illogical movies
Krtoos nahin caar toos
करतूस😂😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=90">1:30</a> dub duble
Another unacceptable scene in Badrinath ki dulanhiya was portraying the male harassment scene as funny scene. Attempt to rape to any gender is just not acceptable but we live in a society where men getting sexually harassed is considered funny.. Because mard ko to dard nai hota!
I love it when jammy speaks in hindi😂
Vo rajnikant hai, vo kuch kar sakte hai  😀 how dare you?
Doing <b>*Tried and refused production*</b> Marathon
Matalb kuch bhi. 🤣😂🤣😂video hi kervaoge na 😂🤣
Just an idea make a video on deserving scenes of certain movies that were rejected by censor board
I swear I am not going to watch any nepotism movie in my life.<br>There biggest power,fame, ego, is due to us audience.<br>We should just stopping entertaining their shit. Stop watching webseries, movies,  shows it will be biggest slap on their faces.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=261">4:21</a> I can expect that from mouth of Salman in reality.
U just remember me the irfan khan sir in starting I miss him no one no one can replace nd no one can act like him great actor with a great movies no controversy no fights with so called Bollywood stars I miss sir I miss u.
There is also another problematic scene in Badrinath Ki Dulhania where Varun Dhawan&#39;s character Badri is molested by a group of men in Singapore and all his friends including Alia Bhatt&#39;s character Vaidehi just started to mock him and laugh at him instead of realizing his pain. What&#39;s ridiculous is that was supposed to be funny! What about that scene? Imagine if the genders were reversed, how regressive and problematic would be such a sequence?
Indian movies are made for such series
Jammy Bro.. The Pronunciation is कारतूस not करतूस ...
It&#39;s  kaartos not kartos

I&#39;m so happy that I haven&#39;t seen any of these
Very good content 👍👍👌
English to aapka masha allah Hindi to usse bhi अति सुन्दर
This episode is &quot;kuch bhi&quot;
Ferdous Wahid danced well in 2017 better than habit
Also, let&#39;s not forget that varun dhawan&#39;s character was sexually assaulted in singapore and the movie played it off as a joke. first of all, rape has never been funny irrespective of the surviour&#39;s gender and secondly, the fact that the only time &quot;gay&quot; people are represented on screen it is only as sex offenders. This movie literally came out three years ago. WTF!!!!
Salman slaps women onscreen and offscreen
Linga scene🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=453">7:33</a> I think the use of the word AKA is a bit misplaced here.. it is generally used for titles of people or characters (Also Known As)... But then obviously you have a better vocabulary... just saying
Bro, today&#39;s video was boring i snoozed for first time... Bhai kuch bhi 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 btw truely agree with content..

Tell about upcoming musical ,horror movies
when i saw all the outburst over kabir Singh, i was amused how the Hindi movie critics had no problem with movies like badrinath ki dulhaniya and judwaa 2.. <br>in kabir Singh both preethi and kabir slaps each other infact preethi slaps kabir more.. if people wanted to criticise that movie then the topic should have been physical abuse in a relation by both instead of talking just about kabir and his behaviour.. <br>on the other hand badrinath ki dulhaniya was promoted as a movie with a strong and feminist female lead. but in the movie she falls for the guy who put her in his dicky and almost strangled her.. a girl with a big heart can forgive a man who did that to her but i dont think a strong and independent girl with any kind of self respect will forget all that and ends up marrying him.. kabir Singh was at least not promoted with a false characterisation of the leads.. that movie had amazing direction, original music and good performances.. on the other hand badrinath had below average storyline and acting with abv avg music..<br>about judwaa the less said the better..
Cartos nahe chutiye kartus...

Govinda’s 90 movies are the same, same and same.
You are wrong,in badrinath ki dulhania when Varun she is dead for me...after that he even refuse to punish Alia..but when his dad said that I&#39;ll ask someone else to do it then Varun accepted it because it was the only way to save her....so don&#39;t show unnecessary things..
Jammy, did you enjoy Kartus?<br><br>Your diction and pronunciation justify your handle&#39;s last name. You are not dhoti/pyjama material. Patloon waali party hai baap 😂🤣
Jammy, have you tried watching animes like Death Note? Would love to see your analysis of these shows! The genius of anime storylines surpasses most of the world cinema.
The thumbnails explain  the dumbness very well.. alia varun are the trademark of dumbness
Day by day this channel becoming illogical. So many errors in tha analysis.

<b>Holy F^ck!!</b>
Badrinath isn’t bad at all, and all his actions would be understandable IF you had given the context. If taken out of context like this, of course it would seem crazy
Human memory, we always talk about the recent visuals more, no wonder most of the comments are on Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya.
I really admire your English
Bad part is using word &quot;sanskar&quot; with dowry, I mean they are making a movie and don&#39;t have a single knowledge about what they are showing, dowry is a thing started by Britishers and now is completely illegal according to Indian law, so film makers stop promoting dowry on the name of sanskar and Sanskrit
I agree with kyuki mein jhoot Nahi bolta scene but that was 90s why things like this still happens now 🌝😂😂
Kuwada 2 was has most absurd scenes I have ever watched in movies.
Sidharth shukla 🤗❤
I don&#39;t know why since last a week or so I am not enjoying your content.
You forgot kabir Singh. It had the worst dialogues. The fight after holi and &quot;I like the way you breathe&quot;
The problem isn&#39;t that they make movies like these or shoot sequences like these ... The problem is that we as an audience and the supreme reviewer accept these movies and make them blockbusters which ultimately encourages these movie makers to go on with there so called creativity and keep doing such things. I mean imagine how long will it take for a logical and progressive guy to think of a reasonable alternative. But the writers are so lazy to even work that much.
Dude time and again...you are sooooooo overtly descriptive ..cut short and come to the point ... otherwise you subjects are good...
In hawa Hawaii song of mr India  also there is black face.. all the dancers 👎💔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=129">2:09</a> jammy bhai why you are always overreact this was accurate
The problem with rajnikant sir&#39;s movies are most directors and producers try to make him god like character that makes the writers write scripts that are shit with no common sense whatsoever.
Humare liya itna torture mat jalo😂
Finally one content which I was waiting for😆😆A relief in times of all negaivity👌👌👌
Badrinath ki Dulhania had a good premise of Old beliefs,Forced marriage and Empowerment written  in a bad 90&#39;s or early 2000&#39;s style..
What to expect from Alia besides dumbness.
One of the best matlab kuch bhi videos...
TRP is killing it🔥🔥🔥

Wtf you said krtoos instead of kaartoos.. you can&#39;t say a proper hindi word but represent yourself as a hindi cinema critique or analyst..
Bollywood has played a major role in planting discrimination,racism and all kinds of gender inequalities in the  minds of Indian audience 😑😑.<br><br>PS: subtitles daal diya kr Bhai , YouTube k Shashi Tharoor.
Its kaaaaaartus...not  करतूस
Everybody makes mistakes, the issue with Dhawan is that he has still not learnt from the shameless filth that he subjected the Indian audience to many decades ago.<br>And there is no reason for him to mend his ways, if sane people don&#39;t actively shame the people who buy tickets to his movies.
Great facts
Why are you using WTF alot in your videos , Be family friendly man
The music when Govinda is setting himself on fire fits the narrative so perfectly 😂😂😂<br>Also on the Kartoos point check out the scene from Hadh kar di aapne where raani (as a joke) hooks govinda up with a black woman and then they sit and make fun of the black couple
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=184">3:04</a> nailed it bro

I love how the film board approves this bullshit, but if a kiss scene or some sensitive topics get brought up they want to edit the film. Fuddu ha Bollywood
Badri was a CRAP film with IDIOTIC nepo people but I agree with what Salman said in Dulhan Hum Le Jaayenge...
Please stop calling them hero and heroine, it really gives me cringe dude.

I love Sidharth shula meme of &quot; kuch bhi &quot;
Video idea -  how the multiplexes are experiencing a downfall because of the lockdown parallel to the rise of content being watched online and why they deserve what&#39;s been happening to them.
You forgot the scene in badrinath ki dulhania where Varun dhawan gets ‘raped’ by 10 men. It’s supposed to be ‘funny’. Half the cinema was laughing. Toxic masculinity.
There is a Bengali movie called &#39;Hemlock Society&#39;. I want you to watch it and share your views. You will understand why I want you to do it.
If Rajnikant Is Legend then What will be Tom Cruise ? Lord of Multiverse ?
Sorry but it&#39;s कारतूस not करतूस 🤭 btw nice video👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
You are right at various points.. but you forget the part movies are mostly for entertainment.. yes sometimes we overdo it.. but mostly it works... And majority of audience knows that its bit over drama.. but you might not like it but majority of audience knows liked it when Salman fought in court room n govinda did that stupidity.. n in case of badri stalking was way too much.. but if you think about it remaining part is true about india.. n in the end things get right which is more important
Video is so good 😍👌
Jammy bhai Its kaar-toos 😄😄
We were all Blinded by their Nepotism.
Its not kartoos, कारतूस
Am wondering if something&#39;s  wrong with me cause i somehow liked &#39;badri ki dulhania&#39;.
Guys come on you&#39;re TRP audience. We are just against talentless star kids not talented starkids like ranbir kapoor, hrithik roshan, etc
Miss u irfaan so badly😣
Bhai wo Rajnikanth he kuch v karsakta he😆😆😆
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=254">4:14</a> there are several movies there u get to see these kind of thing. Telling a women this is unethical in our culture. Basically I think bollywood (the Mafia) is brain washing their audience by telling them    how a its unacceptable 😡 and we should not allow such things in our culture.
I didn&#39;t think the Badrinath point made any sense... <br>Since the movie showed that the character himself grew over the course of the movie and became self-aware and realized that the thinking was traditional and wrong, thanks to Alia&#39;s character standing up. <br>Varun&#39;s character even addresses it in the final sequence and tells his father that he was wrong to tell him to go pick and bring a girl to hang her... And asks him to change the thinking cause its 2017.<br>Just my thought. Please don&#39;t hate it.
This &quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot; episode is dedicated to Dhawan family! 😂
Awesome series
Rajnikant can do anything. Rather many of South Indian heroes can do anything.
My man giving wwe reference <br>Btw old wwe fan
Although I agree to your point that all these scenes defies logic and science don&#39;t u think u are selectively targetting bollywood as several other industries including Hollywood have created several works which defy the logic of science and to name a few X-Men , avengers might substantiate my argument !! Nevertheless good work but a constructive feedback from my side !!
Bollywood is just a pro version of TikTok.<br> Cringe X100

Dude at least learn proper Hindi pronunciation, damn!!<br>Had to comment 2 times
Kya chutiya country me reh rahi hu main f***.. 😒😑
Bro can you please check a Marathi movie called natsamrat staring nana patekar
Loved the CR7💓 reference😂.
Jammy, seriously, where is the separate review of Chaman Bahar? If such movies are not to be promoted deservingly, then why all this talk about fighting nepotism and supporting talent?
I disagree with everything in this video except court room scenes and Linga. It was very obvious that in Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge, Karishma was delibrately flirting while dancing to make Salman jealous. I am not justifying what the guys tried to do later, but you can&#39;t give a clean chit to Karishma either. Badrinath - Are you telling me you were not at all angry with Alia for betraying Varun ? Again, I am not saying Varun was right to kidnap her, but she really used Varun and I hated her for that. That being said, you conviniently missed Varun&#39;s attempted rape scene which was taken rather seriously. Too much pseudo-feminism vibes from this video.<br>Please review Kadar Khan&#39;s scenes from Gharwali Baharwali. They are acually KUCH-BHI.
Whole dam in constructed but no one grows old in linga.
&#39;Kyuki mai jhoot nhi bolta&#39; is wrong and offensive in so many levels.
Clip in starting was Every party song ever By AIB
I really love the way he says &quot;MATLAB KUCH BHI&quot; 😂😂
man its kaaaartooos
hey jimmy do you watch anime?<br>and will you review some of them?
Buddy I press the like button before I watch ur vedio....I know u will be great.
Bhai krupaya hindi me explain karte jao. Most of the Indians don&#39;t understand English. Your points are so logical. Plz.. Make video in hindi if you want to Increase your subscribers.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=370">6:10</a> करतूस नहीं कारतूस
Dark ni dekha kya?
In Badrinath, they showed one good social cause only to  ignored the other problematic things.
But vedahi used him for her personal interest then ran away from marriage
Badrinath ki dulhania was so good. Only women who do not have freedom to pursue their dreams can understand.<br>Vaidahi in badrinath ki dulhania, aarti in shaadi me jaroor aana, taapsee in thappad, these are so relatable characters to those girls who are middle class but are restricted to build their career.
Don&#39;t fantacise nice bollywood movies like badrinath ki dulhaniya, the movie showed the transformation of the character badri in an impeccable manner, I feel that you have no access to the core indian society which the movie wanted to show in an entertaining way
Well done on the video. But Kartoos is pronounced as Car toos 🙂
That&#39;s what you became.<br>Arrey kuch bhi movie ko masterpiece bolunga mai!!!!
I love your content!!
When the director of Linga was asked about that ridiculous climax sequence, he simply said &quot;It&#39;s a Rajini movie so the audience expects some explosive closing sequence. I should satisfy them right? In Hollywood movies they do such stuff too. Because they have a higher budget they make it look good. You accept it. But won&#39;t watch if our movies do it? If you like it, watch it. If you don&#39;t, get the hell out. It&#39;s simple&quot; 😒
It&#39;s &quot; <b>starkids ki filmiya</b> &quot; more
Badri even had the friends laughing at a scene of sexual assault. Only because it was a guy.
Matlab Kuchh bhi
Your content is great but I see all your videos just to hear your voice
Nationality debate😂😂😂😂😂
The much awaited segment, once again brilliantly done 👏 You should make this a bi-monthly thing.
&#39;Matlab kyach bhi &#39; series is the one I eagerly wait for every month.
Abbey कारतूस bolte hain &quot;Angrez&quot;
New Video Idea For You: Make a video on Legend Satyajit Ray
Varunadro Kidnaprio for a reason.
करतूस नहीं भैया, कारतूस (Ammunition)...BTW really appreciate your videos...
Do a review and explanation video of Dark.
Salmon bhai maha Chutiya hai
The thumbnail is a clear attempt of cashing in on the current hate against start kids WAAH
jab tak hindustan mai saneema hai, log chutiye bante rhenge
It&#39;s CAR TOOS...spell it for kartoos
And these actors go to instagram and twitter and talk to media against racism, gender inequality, body shaming, rape, stalking, etc and blame the society...💩
Bhai thoda ladki ke trf bhi dekhlo uska paisa leke  apni bhen ka shaddi krwa li or bhag gyi hmsa akele ldka galat ni hai.....
very poor selection of scenes and poor presentation!
chutiye ... govinda jha khda hai... aur kathghara ka upr wala hissa 6 ft ka hi hua na .. kudrga to uppr se hi na... har jagah dimaag mt pela kr
I will say.Arnab wala ( Kuch bhi )
To all viewers reading this...Me being a Malayali have seen  the TRP channel praising the movies and works by Fahadh Fasil the Malayali actor who himself is a product of Nepotism (Son of Director Fasil). You guys must watch how Fahadh&#39;s debut movie was(which was his father&#39;s itself) but couldn&#39;t find himself a place in the industry as the audience never accepted people without talent...After a decade long interval he came back to the industry; this time after learning acting. It was only after that people accepted him as an actor ,and now you can see how successful he is...He is the best example of how audience play a major role in promoting/demoting Nepotism. Nepotism exists everywhere and it&#39;s the audience who choose whether it should be embraced/promoted or not. <br>There are many other Malayali actors who did launch their children into the industry who were not as talented as them, and all those children actually &quot;struggle&quot; to find a place in this industry. Any malayali or hardcore Mollywood lovers would certainly know examples of such Nepo-kids.<br>All I wanted to say was, it&#39;s always the audience choice to accept real talent and not to promote poor talented people in any forte. Yes we can give chances to prove themselves, but as long as you can&#39;t find any talent...the rest is your choice!
Satyajit Ray never liked the Bollywood audience. He was certainly right.
It&#39;s not pronounced kartoos it&#39;s kaartoos means goli
I have only one question Like why the name tried and refused production??
Bhai u should make video in hindi..<br>It will be ossum
Biggest problematic concept in Indian cinema is hero having extra marital affair or having two wives and it is shown as comedy n fun like in pati Patni aur log,  Gharwalii baharwali, biwi no 1, kis kis ko pyar karu, kyuki main jooth nai bolta and many more..
Could you do a video on who sexual abuse on men gets played for laugh in Indian movies?
There is always be a debate on creative liberty vs social injustice unequality and their normalisation
I don&#39;t know why South film industry treat Rajnikant like a god agree or not. I agree that he does good acting it doesn&#39;t mean that you can do anything. This is  problem of cinema of all over India. Be realistic
Also, don&#39;t forget how they made fun of male molestation in Badrinath ki Dulhaniya. That&#39;s extremely problematic.
U speak hindi very well... 😄
Ahh, that energy from you 💓
Feel free to check out kannada song called &quot;kabharu&quot; from the movie pogaru. <br>It glorifies rape culture and people actually hate it but the comments are flooded with bots.
Simply garbage
It&#39;s KAAAAAAARTOOS not Kartus 😂<br>Although good analysis as usual
Bro Don&#39;t want to criticize but These all movies are fiction, there&#39;s no point in comparing them to what&#39;s logical what&#39;s not. Don&#39;t compare it to real world. Will you also compare Superman, batman spiderman, or thanos finger snap or ant man or movies like inception or matrix to real world? If not then why? Movie are just for entertainment. Be it like that only.  People go for 3hrs movie, laugh, live it, get entertained and then get busy in their life and forgets it.
Jammy y Don&#39;t u direct a movie , imagine every dialogues, every scene and to story will be so perfect 🤷
That hot air ballon is copied from a Jackie chan movie<br>Only difference:Jackie Chan had no green screen
Jammy loves &#39;kuch bhi&#39; <a href="http://videos.it/">videos.It</a> is  fun to hear him chuckle at the Kuch bhi moments
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=150">2:30</a> 😁 that was hilarious and gave me some hope since I&#39;m 5&#39;1 🤣
Fulham hum le jayengay is by far the worst cartoon I have ever watched😶
80 dislikers are those “matlab kuch Bhai” characters IRL😂😂😂
Your pause of because of.... sanskaar is one of the most iconic pauses!! Amazing
the Irrfan Khan touch gave it a better intro and made me to watch to the video even more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WaC3vkgEVU&amp;t=430">7:10</a><br>😝😆
Great video as always!<br>Old bollywood is real cringe.<br>Hearing about Badrinath ki Dulhania makes me proud of myself that I haven&#39;t even seen its trailer let alone the movie itself. <br>      When celebs were posting Black lives matter on their instagram I was appalled by their hypocrisy. Name a female indian celeb who hasn&#39;t promoted a fairness cream in past or still isn&#39;t promoting one. There are very few. Also pay attention to the glowing/ brightening/ dark spot lightening alternatives of these creams. ( Alia Bhatt and Garnier).<br>      We barely see a dusky or deep tone actress on skin even now. And those who are there are popping glutathione pills to lighten their skin. <br> Matlab kuch bhi!
Just one correction its spelled as car tus not kar tus😂
MATLAB KUCH BHI series is problematic...letme explain how.. taken some movie dialogue of the past and measuring it with current society standards will give a feel that how wrongly we were in the past....as the society evolves the thought evolves and what looked funny in the past might be regressive in current situation. It&#39;s like for all the present problems bjp blames congress similarly jammy blames Bollywood which is not fair towards bollywood.
I m lawyer ... <br>Jammy<br>Really what govinda did.. <br>If I even try to do.. <br>My career is ended on the same day
