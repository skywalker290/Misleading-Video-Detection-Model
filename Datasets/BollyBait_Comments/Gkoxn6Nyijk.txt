Very rude behaviour, simply bolna chahiye tha do logo ke beech me mai comfortable nahi hu baithne ke liye uncle isliye mai apne seat par baithungi problem solved faltu ka gyan pel rahi hai, nonsense acha kiya hata diya movie se ye scene . Censor board good job
Koi yeh video Un chutiye tarak mehta ke makers ko Dikhao😂 bohot gyaan pelte hai saale bujjurgo bado ko ijjat Karo ghanta mera 😠
Elder people. Must respect young people too!<br>Most elder peoples misbehave with young people and expects respect😂
Censor board people must be sanghis sanskari idiots😂
This scene is damn relatable! It should have been in the finally edited film.
This scene is damn relatable! It should have been in the finally edited film.
Nobody is thinking about the son who&#39;s infact happy in his mind that he gets to sit with a pretty young woman and stay away from his father&#39;s lectures for couple of hours.. 😂
Why they deleted this ???
Actually Son also not wants his Father to sit beside😂😂😂😂😂.<br>That&#39;s why he said nothing.....<br><br>After all Alia Going to sit next......😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don&#39;t think this scene was to be deleted.... It deserves a place in the movie
Why is the scene deleted? Damn dude sensor board might be kadoos budda/buddi
Is this economy class?
Old man&#39;s reaction was Awesome
Why deleted..? She said it right ... What the hell ... Kuch bi deleted
OK ..Everyone saying this is correct . Tell me what if the genders were reversed . A young Guy who booked the window seat in advance and then an elderly Lady asking him to shift , so that her grown ass daughter could sit with her ....and that guy has to sit in the middle of two grumpy old women ???!!!!!! then what ?????? If the guy refused to give up his window seat , would you all still applaud ? Just want to know the popular opinion on this .
Beta bechara chup ho gaya
Why it was deleted?
Meanwhile the son inside: Are sahi e to bola hain, bethne do na usko mere pas PaPa!!! 😜😜😜😜
People who are ever asking why this scene is deleted. The answer is she could have asked those men to move so she can sit but she is shouting at that man . That&#39;s it. This scene just shows us her mental ability. Hope people got that answer
Hi there. I don’t understand Hindi. I came across this video on Instagram and search here on Youtube to find one with subtitles but obviously it’s not available. Anyone kind enough to translate what the old man and the girl said? I would be very thankful for ur kindness 😊
I want Eng subs 😭😭😭
What did she tell to the old man? I&#39;m a malayali and I don&#39;t know Hindi.I searched for subtitles but it&#39;s Italian and not English.<br>Could someone explain plz...
I so wish this scene was a part of the movie. I experienced this a lot when I was travelling from Mysore to Bangalore and vice versa, when I went home during the weekends and long vacation. I book a particular seat and while some people politely ask if I can exchange seats there were people  who would  sit in my seat and when I point that the person is sitting in my seat he would either just point to the seat they were supposed to sit as if he is ordering me to sit there. One person even went as far as to rebuke my mother as if we were asking them to get out of their seat. His words &quot; Don&#39;t you know how to respect your elders&quot; . We let it pass as we dint we dint want to create a scene, and partly out of respect for that man but now when I look I wish I had told something similar to what Alia said in this movie.
Cencor board officer allowed nude sex scenes but not this ..hypocrisy
I don&#39;t get it. Why on earth did the censor board delete this perfect scene?
Aliya ke Baju me thugesh bhai friend tha 😂
Why did they delete it. It was a good scene.
Well I think she can talk like everyone wants comfort may be if she talk that I can&#39;t sit there thw uncle will manage
Its not deleted
This scene was very much there in the movie
This was not censored
I loved this scene. Most of us can relate to this in trains and flights.
Someone with a below average IQ decided this scene wasn’t important. And, I’m sure he/she would’ve graduated from a prestigious institution of filmmaking, or is a product of nepotism, or both.
The fun fact is that Uncle&#39;s son also want to sit with that girl. Just look at his expression. 😂
Asian mentality 😂
Nice scene tha, I don&#39;t what&#39;s the problem lol
Beta to khush ho gya alia bhatt k bgl me baith kr😄😄
Apna chutiya censor board jo Adipurush ko green flag de diya aur ye deserving scene ko delete kar diya 😂😂
Kat gya isi scene ke dear zindagi puri dekhni padi
This scene might have been deleted because Alia had decided not to go to New York as the guy (Raghu) got engaged and ditched her.
Yeh Buddha mere bitch main bohot bolata hai
Young beta is Happy now
Itna achcha scene dlt but way
👌👌
Somebody give those senior citizens aome burnol
They really shouldn&#39;t have deleted this scene, this was much needed to show to people of such mentality.
deleting this scene should be appreciated. Though everything in the scene was perfectly alright including the context but the age of that papa was the key factor for the scene to be deleted. On the other hand, such an issue is not very frequent in real life but if depicted it could promote it. Third, in such a situation, people usually manage especially for ladies. So deleting this scene was a good approach.
Amazing scene
This scene must have been in the movie. This is so relatable
Eto sundor ekta scene kete dilo...
Satisfaction! 🎉
Oh god! Just encountered same in a train! Sharing my experience with my friend she suggested me the video😂🥴😬
Why was this scene deleted 😢😢😢
Izzat sabko milni chahiye. Umar se jaise izzat ka copyright mil jata ho.
The son be like: acha hua Jaan chuti nahi toh Buddha Puri flight kaan kha jata mere.<br>Kuch nahi bolna Jo ho Raha ha hone do.
This movie is amazing.. I happened to watch it just this month..
Why was this deleted btw??
Vo young beta bhi chahta tha alia uske pass bethe
The best part about this scene is that she was ready to go to another seat and changed her mind only when she got to know how uncomfortable that other seat was. She was not just trying to be a brat, but the exchange was completely horrible. I love that they showed the initial part and didn&#39;t just start her speech straight away.
This scene shouldn&#39;t have been removed from the movie months after it&#39;s release that too. Hypocritical Indian Society...😢
Bade kabhi apni galti mante hi nahi chhoto ki galti nikalte rahte hai
This scene really should’ve made it to the final edit, it’s very necessary for “elder” people to understand the value of respect and humanity and make sure they treat everyone equally and not make anyone feel inferior, no matter the age difference.
Never thought similar incident would happen with me !!! The sheer entitlement with people behave under the pretext of adjustment. Pulled off this scene without knowing 😂
The young betaa was just waiting for aalia to sit with himm😂😂😂
Aliah bhatt mind blowing acting ❤️
Heartly request to team ... Please uploaded full movie Dear zindagi .   ❤️💔
Oh my god I wish they added this to the movie!!!
Busurgo ki esi li tesi kardi<br>Some of them literally just seek for respect
I am surprised this was deleted. Shows immaturity of the censor board in our country.
Now it makes more sense as to why the guy next to her kept looking at her. He looks like he’s about to say something
Scene was deleted probably because they didnt want the senior citizen dsmographic to feel alienated from the rest of the movie.
That old man didn&#39;t even request Alia for exchanging seats, seedhe order de diya! Aur fir izzat ka gyaan bhi de raha h when she refused! The entitlement in most Indian boomers is mind boggling!
Good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTf1uul5zc4">https://youtube.com/watch?v=nTf1uul5zc4&amp;feature=share</a>
Just because someone is more experienced, at higher designation or elder doesn&#39;t mean they should be respected. Respect needs to be earned.
Don&#39;t know why it&#39;s a deleted scene
I remember I watched this movie in the theatre and at that time it was part of the movie, not sure why this has been deleted now. <br><br>It is an epic scene and even till date whenever I take flight I get reminded of this particular scene and book seats of my choice well in advance 😅
Happens too often with single travellers
This scene should have been included there&#39;s nothing wrong in it
❤️
All boomers should be made to watch this
Why exactly was this scene deleted
Yeah this scene was really important. There was nothing wrong.
Hriday ki baat bol diya aapne 🙏
It would be great if they could add subtitles in English...
Best scene ever... 👍👍
It&#39;s not like elders this days are as mature as their ancestors. So they don&#39;t always deserve respect because if they are not that wise enough to be elders.
Oh thats why when i saw this i always felt why the guy next to her was looking at here weirdly and i was expecting him to say something but the scene cuts to next ..
True message By Alia
all  MOTHERs  are  always  the  BeST
Agree dear
I exclaimed, &quot;Superb! &quot;, when Aliya ticked off that arrogant and pompous oldie. I told my teen daughter, to never quietly accept nonsense from such people.
Exactly 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Agar un uncle ko 2 seat saath me chaiye thi to thoda sa phle airport pe jaake ticket counter pe bol dete ki hume 2 seat saath me de do , airport wale to inko window seat bhi Khushi Khushi de dete , plane ke andar kyu seat badalke tang kar rhe ho baaki logo ko 😂
Give respect take respect
this scene should have been in the movie!
Today I Again watched this movie for this scene only, but in flow of movie ,I forgot this scene like it&#39;s not exist in this film ☺️ and now at night m here
All the deleted scenes r so relevant why they have deleted yaar😍❤️
💔
i love this scene
The senior citizen was wrong yes but so problem was that she agreed to sit else where. When it didn&#39;t suite her she came back for her seat. Would she have had the same attitude if it was a business class seat. They should have shot a scene where she disagrees right way.
Mai hota bhen ke lode bhudde uth..  banagad Billa bolte teri manki choot
suppose she got married to his son after getting in an affair in the long journey.
Why was it a deleted scene tho?
The old dude makes me think of Narendra Modi.
I watched this scene on social media thinking. It is some ad. or something because I watched the movie in theatres and I did not watch the scene in the movie and I was wondering where did it come from now I know it was cut.
It&#39;s midnight, I&#39;m watching the movie, the scene comes, and I come here by pausing the movie. . Cus... Sadly this scene is not there.
Yar hamesha young logonko hi kyu adjust karna padta hai
👏👏👏👏👏
I think this scene was not <a href="http://deleted.it/">deleted.It</a> exists in the movie &quot;DEAR ZINDAGI&quot;
why no english sub??
Why delete this one? True and relatable..........
The Buzurg should have been Nana patekar....
Love it
Being assertive is not wrong ....
yeh secen kyu delete kiya sahi to hain ek dam aur waise bhi kya ukhaad liya hattwa ke sabne youTube ke jariye dekh to liya hi hai
It is so relatable. It is a must watch scene
no doubt this screen was amazing... but all the feelings are going down board on the comment section
Yaar kya flight, kya train aur bus. Youngsters ko log aise hi ping pong ball ko tarah apni convenience ke hisaab se idhar udhar bhejte hain. Specially boys ko. Yaar advance planning karo na.... If someone is not comfortable, why to question their sanskaar?.. I&#39;m a 35 year old lady. Once I was travelling with my husband and kid in train. I had head injury just 2 days before travel. I had to travel. Still one person approached me to exchange seat with his old mother. He didn&#39;t bother that I had stitches. When we refused politely. He was heard whispering to his mom, aaj kal log adjust karna hi nahi jaante
Why this is a deleted scene, it&#39;s such a gud topic  for all.
Censor board ki gand ku jali bc
Mere sath bhi hua h
Iss scene ko delete kyu kiya?
This is such an issue with every elderly person trying to use their age as an excuse...
On an 14 hour flight, someone expected me to exchange my prebooked seat with their seat near toilet. <br>If people are so keen on sitting with their family, why don&#39;t they plan ahead?
If this scene was deleted the censor board is fucked up
The lion and the witch and the audacity of the old bitch
Censor board wale khud madharchod hote hai inki behenchod saalo ko jo scenes delete karna chahiye wo nhi karenge bhosdiwale aur jo scene kuch sikh deti hai wo madharchod saale delete kar denge inki bhosdika
Similar incident happened with me. I got a window booked in advance I boarded late. When I reached near my seat saw a old lady sitting in. She was scared and holding her husband&#39;s hand. That man asked me if I can switch seat. I agreed to it as I do not want to separate them and I saw  fear in their eyes may be it&#39;s their first time on flight. The seat I got was in between two men. I really felt uncomfortable. But the man at the aisle seat understood and me, moved to the middle. Really so nice of him. It&#39;s not necessary that people will understand the discomfort and move. Older people should respect younger generation.
Ye scene kis Chutiye ne delete kia/karwaya🥸
Indians have a very wrong attitude of always expecting people to adjust for them.
All those youngsters who like this video , it will be ok if some arrogant, disrespectful girl behaves with your father or mother . Shame on you .क्या इसी लिए बच्चों को पाला था । अपनी इच्छाओं को दबा कर । कितनी कुर्बानियां दी होंगी बच्चों की इच्छा पूरी करने में, पढ़ा लिखा कर समाज में सर उठाने लायक बनाया ।<br>क्या इसी बदतमीजी को सहन करने के लिए पाला पोसा था ? जब तुम्हारे बच्चे बड़े होकर , तुम्हारे साथ इस तरह का बर्ताव करें गे, तब समझ आये गा ।
Delete scene wow censor borad ko isme dikkat Hui.<br>Slow hand claps🤦🤦🤦
This film itself is a therapy 💯

I have watched this movie, but still didn&#39;t get how to deal with problems in a nutshell.... would be really greateful if someone becomes my Dr Jahangir and explains it to me once how to
Happens with me a lot in train <br>Elderly people want youngsters to take all the trouble
That was a superb scene mennnn
Most Elders are incredibly rude and entitled. It&#39;s not good for anyone. If someone is polite and/or considerate towards you, you are likely to pay that forward and be the same to someone else, same goes for being rude.
scene of the decade
👍
This scene was also important other than the therapy session scenes with srk. This scene was exemplary of how we should stand up for ourselves instead of being doormat to every people coming in and out of our lives and forgetting about our needs in the process
Why was this amazing scene deleted? Definitely somebody with no brains dd that. Respect is a 2 way traffic. Y should only we youngsters who should respect elders n its not done by elders too? Y should youngsters younger than us show us we dnt deserve respect but we should respect them? Respect is not something we can buy anywhere. its earned.
Good acting and answer giving by alia bhatt
Love you zindagi  ..
Badonka Samman Karo...But Bade sammanlayak hone bhi chahiye.
Favourite movie
why they delete it,,, 😤😤 amazing 😍❤️😘
That&#39;s why Taliban makes women to stay at home
Alia Bhatt is gross 🤢
I can’t believe they deleted this scene. They really just want the kids to be controlled by elders and give elders right to do anything to us  AND thinK IT IS OK!!!!
This scene couldn’t be deleted <br>Alia Is Absolutely Right
Became a fan after this to Alia...she&#39;s amazing 🔥
Well said 👏
Everything is taken granted.........sometime  age factor  is used like greencard.
Love the scene. Everyone should give respect and take respect. Elders are praising people who give fake respect and not understanding the youngsters who are genuinely giving respect and at times disagree with them politely
This wasn&#39;t a deleted scene
She is rocking in this movie. She doesn&#39;t need Kangana to appreciate her . Love Alia Bhatt.
No one should respect or expect respect from another person just because he/she is born before or after another person.
Most wrost movie I watched is this, if a girls say that nicely than, there is no such elder who said such thing , such stupid movie, completely showing how to disrepect ur elders 😠
I believe respect should not based on age or gender but fight for your respect by disrespecting some one is not also correct. So personaly I&#39;m not like the whole movie because whenever alia&#39;s character fight fir her respect she always going to disrespect someone. You should fight for your respect but witg right way. The whole talk is about Equality, but Equity is more important than equality. For example there are 2 people 1 had 500rs and other had 100rs you equally gives 500rs each but at the end situation doesn&#39;t even change this is the result of Equality. If you give 900rs to poor one and 500rs to rich one then this us something equal which result of Equity. <br>You saw in real world the girl has more rights more protected laws because it works on equity. The girls are facing more difficulties as compared to boys in previous time but now because of equity they are equl with boys or going ahed. If in future the rights of girls are evicted then its okay because  till now the situation comes at equl level.
Age doesn&#39;t make anyone respectable, respect isn&#39;t begged it has to be earned,and these old time people should understand this
Trust me, I would have been far more rude with that buddha.
Aye baby doll kidar se agaye
Yeh scene especially Delhi aur Bangalore ke uncle&#39;s ke liye hai jo subha office ke peak time baher jogging ke liye atte hai apne dheeli dheeli trousers pehen kar aur bekaar ka hangama karte hai youngsters se sadkon pe
Since this clip is not in movie..we need to share this clip with Good Morning whatsapp groups...it will reach mostly all India&quot;s senior cirizens
Why they deleted this scene ...this is true yaar
💯
This is a very realistic and a good scene. But if men do it, everyone would stand up for old people.
She just nailed it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja-etcyXJpI">https://youtu.be/ja-etcyXJpI</a>
Excellent scene 👌<br>It would have been good if this was not deleted 🙏
Alia is best # like me😉
Where can I watch full movie...
Amazing cute
What the fuck...why they deleted.<br>such scenes gives messages too.<br>Only old people dont have their self-respect.<br><br> With too respect for old people , they have seen life but it doesn&#39;t give them rights to be judgemental and selfish. Just because we tolerate every insult n anger of old people, it doesn&#39;t give them liberty to stab on our soul ... our character . Not always old people are right.
That person saying aaj kal ke bachche... Is khatri from kuch rang pyar ke aise bhi...
May be this scene is deleted by conservative mind set,
Kinda female version of Amir khan full with talent and genuine react
Her dialogue and acting scene seems realistic...... Others shraddha hoti to iss scene pe bhii hasti pagal jaisa 🤦🤦😆
Movie name will it come in AMAZON
Was there an inevitable reason to delete this scene
Disappointed as it why it was deleted
it applies to all who asked us to adjust on their behalf
Hit like if you watched Rahul Dua video too on train plane journey. It was fantastic
So intelligent girl bro😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️👀👀🥺🥺😘🥰🥰😘🤣❤️
I love u alia sis u are outstanding😍😍😔😍🥺🥺😔👀😘😌🥰🥰🙂🥰😌♥️❤️❤️🤣❤️😘😘💯😇
This scene is so significant for our generation. We set boundaries and are assertive and some people find us not bending over backwards for their inconvenience&quot;disrespectful&quot; like we&#39;re obligated to make adjustments for them and make attempts to guilt-trip us. High time we realise that fighting for our rights is not selfish. <br>Also, love the girl giving Alia a thumbs up when Alia responds to that uncle
Ah katri came here .... Krpkab..
Wah love it love it❤❤❤
Who is here after watching Insta Reel...
This scene was there in the movie
Speak up 👌👌👌
Respect comes with character ,morals , indiscriminatation and ethics of a person not with age. Parents should inculcate this into their children. Respect is not like property which can be inherited. It is earned by showing you values not Power.
I don&#39;t support nepotism but whatever has been said in this scene and the way it&#39;s acted is very good and must for society!!!!
Uncle ki leli 😂😂
Can somebody give english translation for the scene? Pleae
I loved this scene
Love think . Nice short
Don&#39;t respect elders respect their behaviour.
this happens in reality......😏
Alia was in her rights but she could have spoken in much more respectful and polite way to the man. You can also take your stand and be calm at the same time 😇. Many of us might have experienced this situation in trains or bus.
Sence bahut acha hai 💕💕💞💞💞💞❤🧡🧡💖💖
😀👍
Thisss was the best scene

Duhh!! I literally love this this scene😌how could Nd why they delete this? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Budhay hein saarey ye policymakers
Perfect 👍👌
Similarly happened with me today in train..Same thing uncle told me.....Amazing clip...
Everybody just thinka negative about youngsters and millenials which is so sad and this scene just punched then on the face...shouldn&#39;t have deleted ❤️
Or fir bhi ye scene hata diya gaya how ironic so called elders
Dear kangana <br>U always talk about nepotism. Look at Alia&#39;s acting so natural and outstanding. So, according to c sudnt be in the movie. I can&#39;t even imagine u Inthis scene. Overacting ki dukan 🤦🤦
Assholes people think they get respect because of their age
😀😀😀😀😀👍👍
Need a translation..
exactly on d point.... age has nothing to do with respect... respect is something which is not free but you to earn it irrespective of age... many of d oldies are like this, they expect to be respected jst like that while they themselves being mean to the younger ones.... it shld always be a give &amp; take policy.. u treat me well I&#39;ll definitely treat you better
can someone translate this for me please ?
Awesome scene..
For me, this film has been nothing but pure therapy. It has gotten me through so much difficulty and pain that I couldn&#39;t have done it on my own.
The little girl smiling in the end and giving a thumbs up is my favorite part.
Such scenes mustn&#39;t be censored
Actually yaar humlogo ko hamesha young generations sai compare kiya jata hai har choti aur unlogical wali baat kai liye
Great Answer given by Story writer and delivery by Alia Bhatt.
Yaar apne tho important scene hi delete kardi🙄
Uncle ki chehara aloo hogaya 🕊️
I   appreciate   alia   acting
Maza aaya. Main ye maza pure hindustan ko dena chahta hu 🤣🤣🤣

I have seen this scene before but idk why they deleted this
Best scene yaar. Bechara that banda is scolding his dad in his mind for not letting Alia sit next to him.
They should release the director&#39;s cut with all the deleted scenes 👌
It actually happens

Well said!!.. Well said!!..<br>Young Generation should be well Mannered but then d older shud also reciprocate Dt!!.. Which I personally hv seen.. Many don&#39;t!!
Senior citizens need to understand that they cannot claim respect and obedience as a right just becos they are old. Its a two way traffic. They should equally give respect to those younger than them to show the way.
Isko kaise delete kiya yrrrrrrrrrr  kya seeen hota h ye movie me hota toh 🙁
Good. 👌

Fuck the scene
Movie isliye nahi chali kyuki main main scene toh nikal diye inhone
This scene shouldn&#39;t have been deleted . Each and every senior citizen should watch this . Some elderly people really think that we youngsters don&#39;t deserve any respect from them and that we have to obey all their orders as a sign of &quot;respect&quot; just bcuz we r younger than them !!!!!!
Wow beautiful act😍
❤
Very nice scene  why they deleted 5his scene
Nice 👍
Yeh scene h movie main
Alia is one of the best actress interms of acting she is brilliant ❤ u alia
I have experienced this several time while travelling in train. 😅mtlb seat meri, reservation mera or seat tumhe dedu.. 😂😂 wahh re log......
Same type of incident happened,I was travelling in a local train,and waiting for my seat for past 40min..when my turn came a old man sat, I requested to him to get to the reserved older seats which was occupied by the young age guys..he denied by tantrum of words.. respect is for everyone
I think I&#39;m going to learn Indi so I can understand what she is saying &#39;cause it seems important. Unless somebody can translate it to me?
Wow Kya javab diya superb
Badhiya.. Very good.. 😎😎👏🏻👏🏻
Amazing ❤️
awesomeee<br>man..like I just hate this traditional society...fuck this system.
tell me why was this scene deleted???? it was really good man
Heheh mne bhi ek bar ek aunty se kuch ase hi bola tha mujse choti si glti hui wo mere sar chd gyi mne tbi sry b bol diya tha fir b bolti rhi to mne b suna di 2,4 yar jesa bade log krnge bache b wohi sikhnge wo meri bin mtlb bezti kiye ja rhi thi
Alia is so cute
Izzat milna sabka haq h...sahi baat h
Lgta h jesne ye scene delete kiya uske saath aisa hua hoga😂
Well the concept that elders should respect youngsters back is awesome and all. But... I think the messaging in this scene sort of implied that those two..um..rather healthy looking men somehow disgust her causing her to feel &quot;uncomfortable&quot;. But she is perfectly fine with sitting next to the young guy. This sense of discomfort is understandable but I still think promoting this might send out a wrong message.
This scene shouldn&#39;t be deleted:(

Why did they deleted this ?<br>Such things still happens in the society....
These ethnics are just for movies. At least during the dialogue delivery, if they had paid little bit of attention and learnt something, the Bollywood wouldn&#39;t have been a murder point and druggywood.<br>Shameful people as some of them are muderers and rest support the murders. Disgusting.<br>Anyways, now on if they include or delete the scene nobody is going to watch nautankis anymore. <br>RIP Bollywood! 🙏🙏🙏
We can see why they deleted it.

I loved this scene what a perfect speech exellent worked by Alia
Alia Bhatt&#39;s acting has always been a treat to watch .. in movies like Raazi, Highway ,Love you Zindagi , Kalank she did an amazing work .. despite that she is been trolled by the netizens and idk on what basis .. while actors like Shraddha Kapoor , Arjun Kapoor , Sonam Kapoor , Jhanvi kapoor are pain in the eyes .. esp Shraddha if you see any of her movies properly she screws them up like anything but no one is actually calling them out for spoiling the quality of a whole damn film  !!
in our culture, it is always being taught to young children that they should respect the elders even if they are wrong.
Why was it deleted tho?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVDbdXOmikQ">https://youtu.be/bVDbdXOmikQ</a>
😍😍😍😍....hamid
Waah yaar kya real life scenario explain hua hai, mere saath bhi aisa 2 baar hua flight main. Eik 60 plus citizen mujhe baar baar force kar raha tha seat exchange karne ko bcz he wanted to sit with one of his acquaintances whom he met accidentally in flight, i was like dude thats not my problem if u found ur acquaintance in this flight.
I loved that scene
I am tired of this very much common phenomenon in Train and flight.
They really should not have deleted this scene.. alot of senior citizens on Indian households refuse to respect the youngsters and project them as uncultured or rude. Why? Coz they don’t bow down but tell someone’s mistakes on their face!!?
Exactly
Plz anyone explain in English
Well said !!!
Guys may I know what&#39;s there conversation. I know only basic Hindi  but I can understand only little by seeing their expression..<br> Can anyone explain
Ye delted scene hai???really???but why
I love you Alia you are the best ❤️
This was there in the movie..why ur channel is spreading such wrong information I don&#39;t know..
Shouldn’t have deleted this, I would have loved to see this in the movie and kaira’s character is honestly the best
Can anyone translate in english subtitles   ? Please
Maan gye alia
Great 👍👍👌,,,
Pls translate
This is the reality..of Indian culture<br>They say us to respect elders but kabhi kabhi kahin nah kahin yeh <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23elders">#elders</a> iss baat ka faida utha te haiwe younger generation boud and girls should speak for truth..what&#39;s right !
Some men spends their life dominating their wife and then thy feel same for every female that she is a slave. Young people the way he said he must have looked at his son lolz youngsters who looks nerd
She went for adjustment when she came back because of courtesy his son should have got up or even both of them should go to other and send one back from there
Tabhi Young beta remain silent 😅 and that&#39;s the reason censor board deleted the scene....
Awesome scene

Alia ki acting natural hai and she is really good actor but annaya panday over acting ki dukan aur sara ali khan ki simbba main deka nahi chai wali scene par kece bolrahiti chai 🤮
&quot;Aapko nahi lagtha Izzath milna kabkka hakk hai?&quot; To every elders...
Amazing scene! Why did they delete it? In the name of ‘Elders’, they give me mental torture sometimes. Seriously elders need to grow up!
This uncle has played the role of khatri in krpkab
Why delete this scene? It was amazing how Alia stood up for herself in front of the guy who took her seat!
This scene was there

Alia badi batmiz hai
Ssr miss u
This is the only deleted scene which I would have loved to watch in the film.
Nepotism
Alia is very beautiful
Can some please translate this scene for me in English?
This is amazing😊😊😊
She really have a point 😎😎😎
Why this scene was deleted ? Aise hi hoti hai movies acche scene hata dete haii or faltu ki movie bana dete haii ?!
God is☝.
Ekdam  sahi  soch   hai
This is a very good message why it was deleted?
In the movie she said she lost her parents in childhood...then how is she talking to her mom
😍😍😍😍
Love the way alia spoke....
Great❤❤
What a wonderful actress ❤😍😍
Sabse zayada rule break ye uncle aunties hi karte hei
This scene was on point nad shouldn&#39;t hace been deleted. Everybody deserves some basic respect and that was the all point here.
In reality that “sir” and his “ young beta” use their full volume and make the girl trying defend herself cry by insulting her infront of everyone(true story)
Please link of hasee to fhasee
Alia us good than kat
i wish got english subtitles....
Everyone&#39;s trolling Alia but they have to accept that she&#39;s is a mind blowing actor..nepotism se agar kuch acche actor industry me aate hai to usme burai kya hai? We need to boycott those nepo kids who don&#39;t even know the &#39;a&#39; of acting,like ananya pandey, sonam kapoor, arjun, sonakshi. But Alia,ranbir,hrittik,shahid are best star kids!
Can anyone translate me in english  ? Please
Kitna achha scene tha ye to 😎
why did they delete this scene?!
Y was this scene deleted? This is epic...!
One of best scean in ths movie.. bcz i think to watch.. bull shit
i gess that&#39;s true
I love the scene why was it deleted? Her acting was good and she was being nice when she agreed to go to his seat first so yeah...!
Just found this to be amazing .. do check it out ❤️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb0Gh-Mx3s0">https://youtu.be/Mb0Gh-Mx3s0</a>
This is not the deleted scene ...i have seen this scene in the movie🤔
This is the best movie ever...
The same thing happened to me on the train <br>The elder was sitting on my seat and he didn&#39;t even have reservation because of him everyone has to change their sitting plan..
Elders or old citizen stay at home else covid will kill u 🤣🤣🤣
Meanwhile londa: aillaaa alia..😆
What was worth deleting in this beautiful scene?
Someone can explain what alia is speaking .. I couldn&#39;t understand .. But sounds like she s very correct .
The censor board theory is quite plausible but here is another suggestion: this scene occurs in first 10 mins of movie and it would have given away the whole plot in starting itself that&#39;s why it was deleted for keeping suspense
Agar aapko best tareeke se movie download karna hai to mere Channel pe aaiye..koi bhi movie ho Hollywood ya bollywood sab download kar sakte hai aap...step by step sikhaya hai ....channel neme...TheEngineerसाहब
Dikhane vala tha ye😎scene
They shouldn’t have deleted this scene. Who all agree with me ?
Why they deleted this scean ?????
if only this scene was in the movie :)

Why The Hell This Scene Is Deleted!
Dont wear my spec, put mask on your back to avoid something postive
2.5 k elders reacted on this video 🔥😎...
I wonder why is it deleted
Uncle ki fat gayi
this scene should Not have been deleted
But this should not be deleted bcz is this is the truth
they should have kept this
Very true, even a right think become wrong bcz We are adult and taking with some senior citizen who think they are right or even if wrong then they are senior citizens.
I have no idea why dis scene wasnt included to the movie.. Such a real and impactful scene it is... Kuch log bas apni seniority ka faida hi uthana jaante hai sanskar aur sabhyata ke naam pe...
2 min silence for jo abhi tak film nahi deka yaha deleted scen dhekne aya
This scene is already in the movie at the very beginning
way of talking wasn&#39;t perfect but what she said is perfect
Alia is too op
Boo she is so rude to elders. Shame Shame
Please see my song vedio .
Love this movie
Why they dlt this scene
Hai n
nice this scene should have been in the movie. There is nothing wrong in that scene. cheers to alia gud actor she is.  itself a hero she is.  Although m not a fan of her but even then lots of appreciation for her well done
Actually what Alia did was right and wrong both.But as per the Rule a senior citizens will sit first then others Do not boss over anyone from next time.
why they deleted this scene. actually all senior citizen should watch this.
Son would have been cursing his father all the while..
Why was this scene deleted??? <br>It was so good
Beta phir bhi chup Raha .. 😔
Itta acha scene♥️ pata nai kyu delet kare😡
I watched this movie before Ramadan..... too gud
Can someone translate this plz? ☹️
This scene would have been a hit if it were kept in the movie!
Please post the sohni mehiwal movie youtube for the time being of quarantine.
Good one... Why this scene cut
why they deleted the superscene some times elder should respect !
Correct
Abe yaar aise scene delete kyu kar dete hu yaar
Singapore airlines!!!! Hmmm
2400 dislikes from senior citizens 🤣😹😂🤣🧐
This scene was the best
Sometimes similar actually happened to me. I had booked the best seat for myself in first class (note: just reserving a seat cost couple hundred dollars) and this fat french lady asks me if I would be willing to move back to the economy seat so she could sit beside her daughter, I simply said no. She asked again and I said no, she sat with a weird face. She then proceeded to ask the flight attendant to ask me. Now you see, usually any shy person would oblige but I simply said no, the flight attendant asked AGAIN and explained it was an aisle seat. I was polite yet firm, I said &quot;No.&quot; <br><br>For the rest of the flight, because my seat was literally at the luxury point in first class, I ordered warm tea, snacks and service and received 100% attention, rightfully, so. I am a hardworking individual and have the right to what I have paid for. If that lady wanted to sit with her daughter, she should have booked a seat and paid the fee in advance. Nothing is free in this world. I am so blessed to be a woman who stands up for herself. People think it&#39;s aggressive, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;d rather be bossy than a pushover.
I&#39;m agree with alia right yr log smjty hain k.young ha to arjust kr ly gi

The boomer generation needs to realize ki baat sunna nahi aata, ya youngsters ki vishesh tippadi jisse woh disrespect kehte hain, woh nahi sunna, to youngsters ki baat sunaya bhi mat karo. Treat everyone with respect. This get out of jail free card because of age is really fucked up.
Yes I have come across this kind of elderly people. Fuck such people&#39;s.
This is my favourite scene🤣❤️
Eleder people not respect younger i have experience
But this scene is in the Film 🙄🙆
Haha
Nice one
Over done
Meanwhile the young son was happy getting a young girl next to him
It is a shame that this scene got deleted.
Love this line &quot;excuse me sir don&#39;t you want everyone get some respect&quot;.
Hat yaar... kitna gatiya scene he, aaj kal ke bachcho me akal hi nahi he<br><br>aakhir alia agar nahi bethna chahti thi bich me to vo pehle jo bahar ki side betha hena coat pehne(on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkoxn6Nyijk&amp;t=39">0:39</a>) usko request kar sakti thi naa bich me bethne ke liye lekin nahi vo to direct jaakar uske baap par chilla baithi😠😠
She is correct here
Why they delete such good scenes ? Do they have any problem (in head)?
Well done alia good job 👌
Excellent 👍😍
Uncle ji very aggressive. He is giving that Delhi wala uncle vibe. I thought he will eat Alia up.
Nice and right
Well done 👍
Nice
So true 👌
Lol movie
I can totally relate with this &quot;Izzat milna sbka haq hai aur Kabhi kabhi elders ko bhi young logo ki respect karni chahiye&quot; 😪
I think in every flight either one complete row should be ladies and another row should be gents row.everyones life should be easy and peaceful

Young beta 😜😜✌
Young bete ke dil me kitne galiya nikalrahe honge baap ke liye.
You are right
Well, I don&#39;t agree with how she behaved. She could have said it politely that she is not comfortable in sitting there. This happens a lot of times, as a female even though i pre book my seats, but whenever other two passengers are male i request to change my seat or ask someone to exechange with me. Whatever you want you can say that politely. It&#39;s rude.

Right
Respect the person who is right.<br>Forget its a 3 yrs child or 90 yrs old citizens.
Isko specs shuit hi nahi karta, kutti jaisi dikhti Hai.
Some senier citizens are really egostick 🤣🤣 but aali u are absolutly right in this situation kyu do mens  k beech baithe jb use wha comfartable nhi lag rha jb usne apni seet book krwai hai to or rules are rule
Ye seen hona chahiye tha isme bhut accha msg hai hmesha choto ko hi sikhaya jata hai ki bdo ki respect kro bdo ka bhi utna hi frz bnta hai ki choto ki bhi kadr ki jaye conditions k according unhe bhi kbhi kbhi smjhna chahiye <br>Its not about the age its about self understanding

Why they cut it ....<br>She is absolutely right
Acha to tha isme kya khrab tha

Respect sub ki karni chai hai ;elder ho young .
Papa ka beta arijit singh jaisa lag raha hai
She is not willing to sit between men but her real father put her between legs of dirty men for money....Amazing logic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkoxn6Nyijk&amp;t=97">1:37</a> buddha parcel😂😂😂
If she really thinks tat man and woman are eqaul then what is the problem in sitting between two man
agr ye scene deleted nhi hota to ye movie pkka flop hoti
Dont go theatre for this katmulli please
Adults🤐
Are uncle ji arijit singh ke paas baithna chahti h wo use baithno do<br>😀😀😆😆
But the one I watched, this scene was included!!!
Why this deleted and who dare to delete this and how ??
Alia is so angry she will kill the uncle😂😂😂
Nice concept
Why do they cut this?this is really a big problem in our country. elders always want Respect just bcoz they are elders even they don&#39;t reserve.why don&#39;t people understand respect must be earned that is not their inborn  Right either person is elder or young.(no offense no anyone,it&#39;s based on my personal experiences.)

LIBERALISM OVERLOADED🤔👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This scene is deleted from the film so that the youngsters can&#39;t show this scene as an example against some of the toxic behaviours of aged people...

I really wish that ,this scene,<br>should have shown in the movie  because in our Country elders think that they are always right<br>Instead the person who is right should be given importance and not to the  seniority
Bhudhe hote he pagal h
Okay boomers 😎
Achha scene tha
Mujhe bhi aisa incidence ka samna krna pda.. <br><br><br>Pr tb maine unknown uncle k liye adjust krna pda...

This is my favourite scene !!!
OK boomer
Nyc
English subs, please.
Boomer&#39;s everywhere
It is a good scene with a good message, no doubt, but I am going to offer a minority view here - the reason she refused to sit was because the two people (esp the one in the t-shirt) were fat and that in itself is a concerning sub-text. The scene would have been more powerful and made the point it is aiming to make if she refused to move without checking out the other option. There is subtle and possibly even unintended body shaming there. An alternate perspective, that is all.
This scene was great<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dis">#dis</a> was needed to be attached
It&#39;s good to see yaar why it&#39;s deleted
1.7K dislikes are by senior citizens 😂
Jitne iske views h utno ne bhi ye movie nhi dekhi hogi
Why the hell was this scene deleted for...???
Lame
I know why this was not in the movie. Indian sanskar, the core Indian values, which says follow as your elders say. Dont put your brain. Dont deny anything they say. In short “bado ke aage na bolo chahe aap sahi e kyu na ho, isse bado ki besti hoti hai”.
Love dis scene
who is the happiest at the end??<br>Young betaa<br>😂
this clip needs to show in every public transport vehicle.
Chutiya movie and srk
Yes what&#39;s wrong if alia is comfortable in sitting with a young men and not in between two old aged men.....aakhir feel bhe to koi cheez hai na......😂😂
Why does it deleted ?🤨
&quot;Aaj kal ke bacche bhi na&quot; This regular dialougue is very disgusting.
ok boomer
I still haven&#39;t seen the movie but now i will because of this clip
Elders have less patience, so we should never mind if they ask some extra favour.
this should&#39;ve been in the movie
Well said..
This film looks good😍
I can relate to this a lot. My grand mother does the same and one day I told her the same. Elder in our society miss uses the culture. for example my father always calls me at night to bring water.<br> He is absolutely fine and fit but why the fuck he just can’t stand up and do his own work.. the water dispenser is just 2 meters away. I calls me from first floor of our house...
I don&#39;t want to sound rude but, thank god it was deleted....😊
Aaj kal ke bade bhi na chhoto ki respect nahi karte h
What was in it to be deleted ...
Right
Same kind of incident happened with me in train. He took my upper birth and commanded me to take middle birth.  First asked him to get down and when he started to use tantrum I forcefully pulled him and thrown him on floor
Watched it more than 20 times, I love this ❤🌹
This scene is awesome, should have been in the film smh
The girl giving thumbs up at the end 💥💥👍
If you are open minded elders definitely judge you...without thinking
Some elder deleted this scene
Well now the whole world is inspired by her speech no one respects elders
she could said that in nicer way and realize uncle why she dont want to exchange seat. sometimes by seeing other on fault we make even big blunder to prove him wrong.
If they had kept this scene in the movie, kids and young people would&#39;ve pointed this issue out and people would talk about it which would be unacceptable to parents and elders. They&#39;d have criticized this Alia and the movie, called it provoking, negative influence, bratty etc etc. Probably that&#39;s why they played it safe. The elders can be extremely intolerant. Smh.
thankGOD ke ye delete krdiya gaya.... ye kya baqwas sikhai ja rahi thi new generation ko . we must recpect our elders and sometimes we need to sacrifice just for their happiness  and there is no shame  in it. GOD will give you the reward of it so be confident
Fuck Feminism
First she should have told him that she is uncomfortable sitting between 2 men... He probably wasn&#39;t aware. Agar uske baad bhi he didn&#39;t get back to his seat, ye sab rebel justified hai... We often forget that sometimes when commutation is clear, things happen smoothly and faster... Often things we need to say first happen later in a conversation when the tension and volume is high...!
this was a poorly done scene - first acting of that papa - son duo was terrible, second in real scenario people request politely they even plead, they are pushy and are very irritating - but they are not so outright rude. and to give them a comeback is not easy, because you can answer rudeness with anger, but how do you answer a pushy person - you can answer them only by being firm and  then if required get an air staff to intervene.
thank god.. she didn&#39;t dhoptoyi uncle....
Those who disliked r old hags
To ye deleted q tha...
This scene is still in movie.. wrong title 😒
Ohh,,That&#39;s why Ranbir Kapoor loves her 😍 😍
Absolutely love this scene. It needed to be in the film. I have seen a lot of older people who demand respect only because of their age. But they don&#39;t feel the need to give respect to anyone else
ek dam sai 👌👌👌
This was my favourite film. I can relate
You right
same happened with me
Wow...
We should not respect anyone with respect to their age or  gender bcoz respect is not an alms, it should be earned by our personality and behaviour.
Absolutely right!!<br>Agar ham youngers elders ki respect karte hai to unko bhi khud pe ghamand na karke hamara thoda sa maan rakhna chahiye...
is this Saudia Airlines? bcz in this Airlines you will find trouble to find seats with your family unless this is First class or Business class!
This was the reason y that guy stares at alia few times in the movie
ye scene deleted kyo kiya gaya
Such depressing bastards I tell you
itni acchi scene delete kyun kiya
sometimes Elder should respect young people........what a line man i totally agree with this statement or this scene..... Dammm but how could they cut this scene shitt 😶😶😶😶
This scene is great scene. ..but I think..at this point in the movie..they were supposed to depict kaira as a little eccentric to show that she&#39;s emotionally disturbed and this made too much sense and was normal for any person..which was not the intention .they were trying to depict
This was not deleted.<br>This scene still exists in the movie.
It jst thrilled me ........fantastic....
Exactly every one deserves to get respect it’s not about age 😊
i agree with what some people are saying but maybe they haven&#39;t seen it but i have seen such scene where a older people TELL the younger people to accommodate them! Yeah i agree all elders are not like this but there are many people who take advantage of the comfort that younger generation give them out of generosity!<br>#<br>THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT YOUNGER GENERATION GIVE UP OR DOES FOR THEM IS A COMFORT, AND THEY SHOULDN&#39;T TREAT IT AS THEIR OWNED LUXURY OR SOMETHING THEY HAVE THEIR RIGHT ON!<br>#<br>● Here alia would have considered changing seats with him if he had REQUESTED her but instead he ORDERED her to sit on his seat. And when she saw that she won&#39;t feel comfortable between 2 men and asked him that she want to sit on her own seat, he made a remark stating that younger generation doesn&#39;t respect older generation.<br>#<br>● My second point is that he is a man and he wants to sit beside his son but he didn&#39;t consider that Alia is a lady and she may feel uncomfortable sitting in between 2 men.<br>#<br>● And my 3rd point is that for airplane seat people make Advanced booking for a certain seat of their Choice and many a times booking a preferred seat costs more than getting a random seat. So if i am paying anything extra on a normal ticket i won&#39;t give it up for anything. I won&#39;t consider if someone wants to sit with his son or daughter (except if either of them needs other person&#39;s care). Man she have paid for it then why should she give it up for some total stranger?
This scene should have been in the movie!
well she could have told about being uncomfortable sitting between the two men rather than just saying that she wants to sit at her seat
👍
Prfctscene ...y dltd
Pls anyone know the link of this movie pls send
Awesome
Can someone please upload this movie <br>I so badly want to watch this
Mera sath bhi aisa ek event plane me hoah that,par koi nahi mujhe apne mom, dad ke sath badhne ka mauka mil Gaya!
When I watched the full movie I was wondering why the boy wearing glasses was giving angry looks to aaliya. Now after watching this I got to know the reason that aaliya took thier class...
Agar uska seat middle m tha to vo side vale gents ko middle m baithne bol skti thi or khud Uske seat p baith jati why to create hype all the time🙄🙄🙄🙄
It&#39;s not a deleted scene. Stop publishing your video with wrong information.
yeh sayad best scene tha or ese hi delete kr diya wow
Pehli ki junration se Aaj ke bachche hi aache hai
I&#39;m currently watching the movie on Netflix and I paused the movie to watch this scene. This is a real good scene.
Super scene
I don&#39;t know about plane&#39;s but yaar this chutiyaapa always happen in train.  Literally every fucking time
favourite movie ♡
Correct please respect Youngers<br>Because They are also smart Then elders😃😃😁😆😆😆😃
This scene must not be deleted. Elders must think about the youngers..
This clip is good but still need to delete some part on it.. Mudda sahi hai par ..kuch bhi ho elders se  aise baat nhi kr sakte
someone translate in english pls?
Those &quot;two men&quot; haven&#39;t done anything yet the character is judging them. Nice it was deleted. This is ego, nothing else. Proper logic should be that I will give up my seat only if it is needed by situation (medical etc.).
very nice
Why is this deleted from movie as nothing is wrong with this clip
This scene shouldn&#39;t be deleted actually.. It is quiet prevalent in the society.. How older ppl especially aunties who treat youngsters like animals with no respect yet they should be respected for their abuses...
when you delete a moral scene from the movie and then post it on  youtube  (*_*)
It&#39;s not a deleted scene
I don&#39;t know why this seen is deleted even though this seen gives best message
true words
Picture mast hai yaar.  Part 2 chahiye
Even after watching this some people will still say &quot;Ye aajkal ke bacche&quot;
Bilkul shi this type of situation I have also faced
Love this film...

This scene is amazing In DEAR ZINDAGI Alia&#39;s character was of a losted girl she didn&#39;t know what she was doing with her life she was going through really bad depression But in this scene she looks very clear about her opinion  and a colleted person may be thats why they had to edit this scene
What a scene man. alia  totally nailed it..
Everybody deserves respect and freedom 👍
Kyon delete Kiya?
Nice part
Yahi baat kisi ladke ne kisi aunty ko bola hota toh woh battameezee ho jati aur wo security ke dhakke khaakar nikalta bahar 😡😡😡

Why this scene was deleted in the movie.??<br>It is a very good scene to learn something🤔🤔
Cutiee

They should not have deleted this scene 😶
I really wish that they would&#39;ve put this clip in the movie ya
Aisa reality m koi kare to bechari ladko ko badtmeez kahenge jaise in budho ko apne budhape k naam par sab mil jana chahiye aur sab ho jana chahiye😏...

Upload this movie plz😊
this scene was show on TV as  an add some kind of booking app
Itna acha scene cut kar diya kyu 😵😵😠😠😠
She could have easily said the foreigner to shift and would have sat on the corner seat which is the same condition here. Why so much drama. Good that such scene was removed. And faltu me badon aur choton ka angle dala isme. There was no need for that.
Why the F*<b>**</b> is this deleted scene?????????
This happened in real life also. What to say these people.
scene directly lifted from some episode of Family guy scene involving Stewie griffin...thoda exaggerating version<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbhGvp3MoYc">https://youtu.be/QbhGvp3MoYc</a>
Thanks for explaining that respect is for everyone.... It&#39;s not reserved!!
Why did you cut this beautiful scene??
Chutiya ladka bap ki baizzati krwa ta rha Or chup rha.
Ego issue.
I think his son is extremely happy now.. cuz the cutest girl is just besides to him....lol...<br>.
Actually the censor board officer must be senior citizen🤣🤣🤣
Not only younger respect to elder, women also respect to men in this type of situation. For eg. We are travelling in local bus if a men sitted women come and said don&#39;t you have manners. Ladies are standing and you are sitting. Even half of the bus sits are already reserved for ladies till than they want more respect. Why always man or boys sacrifice women or elders also think abt it. If they can comfortable then travel in buses or  train. If they don&#39;t then arrange for themselves private vehicles.
Bahut Sahi baat ki
Mujhe allia ki chut chahiye
I watched this movie.
It was not deleted in movie
Good scene deleted 😞... it should be in movie... kya bolte ho
Young peopal

Hahhaha,,, do old logo ke bich me nahi baith skti,,, idhar usko jawan larke ke sath baithne me maja ayega... Kya bakchodi hai...
this scene was there in the movie. i have seen this in the movie.
It doesn&#39;t mean alia is inteligent
Well said alia.... Why is this scene deleted...??????
♥️
Uncle ka ladke ko to maza aa gaya aaliya k pass bethkar😁😂
Alia is gem of an actress...damm
In this scene Alia is more looking gorgeous and princess in sitting on the seat with the chashmah😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
This happened with me. Only if I could speak up. <b>sigh</b>
ye scene to girls vs boys wala h..
This incident is happened with everyone 👌👌
Alia is looking stunning
Yeh delete nahi hona chahiye thaa
It was a great scene <br>Why did they delete this
Obviously this scene deleted cause it sends wrong message..any elder watching this scene will not be happy.. yes its her right to seat on booked seat.. But our Indian culture teaches us to Respect elders and women..
The actual essence of this scene is &quot;That every individual has a right to speak up or Say no to something If u aren&#39;t comfortable &amp; that&#39;s 💯 Absolutely fine &quot; Because mostly we chose to give up on what others want us to do but kept feeling inside to Say No !!!
Mast scene
Editor bada pagl h..
This was not deleted, i watched it. Just coz u watched pirated movie which didnt have some scenes does not mean u call them deleted
Bc plane main kon bye karne aata hain
Sahi kia !
Happy that we gotta watch this scene at least in YouTube
Just love this scene
f9
Dear zindagi nahi zand zindagi 😂😂😂
Love it
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Wow
This scene was there in the movie when I saw in theater😅
Yeah once I saw a middle aged woman scolding a girl to give her old people seat in bus,that poor girl who waited for that seat for 30min gave away,then a 7-8 th month pregnant lady boarded she stood in front of the so called old lady but she did not even reacted.then I asked her (of course I am also standing)does she need a seat ,she reacted with a pleasant swile that she will get down in next stop,so no need to worry.She is a good lady wish her happiness and that to that  old lady 😤😤😤 leaving for your own imagination 😂
Why tf it was a deleted scene eye-
It is a very good scene.. Why deleted
Aise scene kyu cut kiye Yaar 😔
to be honest...!!! no man makes a woman get up.. it is always women who want to either sit with someone or simply sit on the window seat. infact i have seen women request men to leave window seat for them.!!! and a lot of men do get up... and no indian man will make a woman sit between two men.. infact an uncle offered me his aisle seat because mine was the middle one and there wud have been men on either sides.. ! such individual experiences dont prove anything for us to generalize or make judgements about either elders or aaj kal k bachche .. take it as her personal experience with a jerk.. dont judge..<br>and feminazis.. u guys are such losers.. u have started making women feel so entitled these days.. if respect is nothing to do with Age..so does it not relate to gender... i am not respecting a person just because she is a woman.. infact, whenever i have travelled, i see women not Adjusting.. at all!! even in trains, they change births, occupy the entire luggage space without humbly requesting and men always give them.. they judge other women.. !! they judge u on your clothes.. break queues.. spread hate.. stop putting people against each other leftists... good values are for everyone to incorporate equally..
This scene is amazing...like how she was ready to change seats but then seeing how that old guy didn&#39;t wanna sit in the worst seat I.e middle seat an despite knowing it&#39;s his fault already wanted to create a ruckus but Alia&#39;s character would never take it..... Love h Zindagi .... Dude middle seats are worst
😂😂
its nt dltd dear
<b>Why on earth, this scene was not included in a movie</b>
On Alia bhatt&#39;s part I really wanna that straightforward to elders but on the elder son/daughter&#39;s part, I guess I will not be able to hear that and will argue from Alia&#39;s part (even if its illogical); surely on my place I will say my dad that u were wrong but publically papa ki beizzti koi kr ke chla Jaye n uska bchha baitha sunle....it&#39;s tough
This is a really amazing scene the point she makes about respect is incredible. Because respect has nothing to do with age. Respect should be equal to all.
Yeh budhai mere desh ko Barbad kardengai
I dono why they have deleted this scene
Kon kon tiktok dekhke yaha aaya h😍😜😆

Ohh so this is the reason why the man i.e. &#39;young beta&#39; sitting next to Alia was so sad in the film.
Koi dear Zindagi movie upload karo YouTube par please.
🖒🖒🖒🖒👏👏👏
This same thing has happened with me last year✌✌
Very bad behavior of alia
It&#39;s true sometimes elders have also something to know from younger&#39;sand younger&#39;s<br>have to teach elders . All the time elders are the not always one who tells the right.👍👍👍👍👍

They should have 100% included this. This is such an important topic.
Good video..

True..
Woh uncle ka beta isliye nai utha kyunki usko pata tha jab Baap jayega tab hi na Maal baithe gi. 😂
Alia king boliwood no 1
Not only elders...  I find the people really annoying who are just after your life for your seat in airplanes or trains....  Goddammit and they seriously act like you&#39;re the bad no worst person if you don&#39;t understand...  WTF
Well Done .<br>What she has done is absolutely ethically right and why should we youngsters should adjust have we taken the burden of adjusting everywhere and disturb our ease of comfort of travelling peacefully.<br>😊😊😊😊😊
Alia&#39;s acting is amazing 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
Eng sub~
Hey Shubhi!

Fantastic scene😍😍
Papa ka to pata nahin lekin beta khoosh huva hoga 😝
Wah yaar kya baat boli hai.
Typical Indian woman who is afraid of men.
Barabar hai
Brilliant scean older people forget sometime to give respect
Quite a similar incident happened to me tdy, these elder persons also have to learn to give respect to the young persons
This scene should have been kept in the movie
Bench mark for Alia, I wish they make a sequel of this movie  ❤️❤️❤️
This shouldn&#39;t be deleted
Is desh me agar young generation adjust na kre... To hmare senior citizen kuchle hue mile har jagh
I&#39;m a south Indian  although all Indian parents/elders are with the same mindset still north Indian elders treat girls as a second grade I don&#39;t know why
SOME ELDER&#39;s EGO DELETED THIS SCENE FROM THE MOVIE.🙂🙂
Ek number
Should not be deleted
True as fuck
“ 2 aadmiyo ke beech me uncomfortable beethu &quot; this is so fuckin sexist now the asshole feminist Wont say anything  bloody hypocrite asshole feminist

Why they missed it ?!
