Bandit Queen was traumatizing experience for me, even more horrible thing is, this movie is a biopic.
What about the rape scene in Bulbul??? It was the hardest thing i had watched in a movie? I couldn‚Äôt sleep for nights üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Have u guys ever seen kamal&#39;s mahanadi <br>It&#39;s the most disturbing movie in indian cinema
matrabhoomi by far the most disturbing movie for me..... u can also add bandit queen to your list..some scenes were really tough to watch.... and even malayalam movie biriyaani can make it to ur list ... i found it very very difficult to watch
Deshdrohi
Analytical and Awarding for the Audiences. Applauds ( For the channel)‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>Suggestion from a movie buff- Films inspired from real life. (With or w/o modifications)
I watched matrubhoomi years ago, I haven&#39;t had the courage to watch it again. But recommend it to be watched once.
LSD&#39;S Honour killing
There is nothing hard to see.
Don&#39;t say indian movies <br>  These are all Bollywood
Jammy, I recommend you to watch DROHKAAL.
It&#39;s hard for me to watch when rashmika &amp; Pooja acting..üòë
Pataal lok- You know what scene I&#39;m talking about
Yeah I too got to know about this matrbhoomi movie maybe a year back but yup it kindaa shocked me
You forgot to mention &quot; satyemev jayte 2&quot;.
I get traumatised just by listening this.
I&#39;ve watched raman raghav it was a nice movie
Mardaani 2 scenes and also main hoon danddhikari movies scenes that disturbed me a lot...should hve been there
The bandit queen, kept me clicking fast forward on how disturbing it was
Chandini bar was also very disturbing especially what happens with Tabu&#39;s son in Juvenile jail was very hard to watch
Mahanadhi by Kamalhaasan should be in this list.
Trigger Warning:<br><br>In Pataal lok, I don&#39;t remember the characters&#39; names (and I really don&#39;t want to revisit it right now), there is scene where in flashback it shows how one of the accused&#39;s mother is raped by the whole village in front of her family in broad daylight due to caste based reasons. <br><br>Seriously can&#39;t imagine how actors do it and how they deal with it afterwards even. Must be traumatic.<br><br>I&#39;m already sorry to anyone who is reading this and is reminded of the scene or even if they have to imagine it.
Sunil Shetty Asin Sharman JoshiHarman Baweja, Shilpa Shetty Genelia Ayesha Takia..Where are these Bollywood stars <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pbvvSxDqnc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pbvvSxDqnc</a>
Masan opening scene was also really disturbing
Laxmi movie is also unbearable
i happened to watch matrubhoomi and it has haunted me for yearsss..it is beyond my understanding what tulip joshi must have gone through while preparing and acting for the movie. More than that, my heart aches and goes out to the women who went through this barbaric and non-consensual treatment.
Laxmi was the most disturbing movie I watched.  Bigg boss is another disturbing show I watched.
I still haunted by that page 3 scene üò∂
Bro ur work is awesome....but if possible can u pls change intro
Another gem of a movie feathering Adil Hussein is What will people say that is in some scene too brutal to watch
Un-freedom: The story about a lesbian daughter whose father is brutally against climaxes into a scene where the father gets the whole police station rape his daughter in the cell in an attempt to ‚Äònormalise‚Äô her sexual preference and watches the deed through while she screams. The movie ends with both the characters making eye contact. <br><br>Adil Hussein is a gem actor and his acting üî•üî•
i have watched matrabhoomi and it&#39;s really disturbing but it depicts harsh reality of the society where in some areas women are still being treated like this.
Bulbul is also one of them.
Welcome back ‚úãüèºüòê
Bandit Queen rape scene And humiliation by Thakur&#39;s should have been top of the list
Reality is always harsh and unbearable.
You should review Priyasakhi movie, I feel like that movie showcases on many double standards
In the series Patallok when the village PPL rape the mother one by one was hard to watch
I was having lunch thank youüôÇüëç
A Serbian film
Radhe dekha aur ab main trauma mai hoon üò≠

The story of &quot;Omar&quot; is similar to one of episodes of &quot;made in India&quot; TV series. And both the film &amp; series have &quot;arjun mathur&quot; as cast! I guess &quot;made in india&quot; took inspiration from &quot;omar&quot;
I think you should add Sara Ali Khan&#39;s &quot;Tum mujhe tang karne lage ho&quot; from LAK 2
I honestly thought it was sidharth malhotra in I am poster.üò≥
In Anniyan/Aparichit movie there was a scene where ambi was packed in a cover and beated like a boxing bag was damn disturbing
Watching Radhe is the most disturbing experience
Lajja should be there in the list- Mob attack on Madhuri dixit, rape scene of Rekha was very disturbing...
I think you are a gay üòÇ
South Indian movies has a good storyline but some dialogues and scenes are so shameful to watch and hear like heroes always tried to save heroines from horror villains and following her without her consent and such many more things aren&#39;t enjoyable to me üòêsorry if someone get hurted by my lines...
I don&#39;t understand why we let white people narate our stories: aka Matrubhumi. It&#39;s getting old at this point. Let&#39;s take charge of our narration.
Madhuri(pregnant) beaten by some female constable in some old movie in which SRK was mentally ill! Can&#39;t recall the movie
Dil se : The scenes were amar manhandling meghna in the name of love and forcefully kissing her ( dessert scene) made me sick to watch it further. <br>Maniratnam movies are great, but dil se is the one that i couldn&#39;t watch completely and  made me think about how stalking and toxic masculinity is normalised as romance in movies
There was the whole sequence in mom where the girl was being r*ped and then was found floating in the gutters üòî
Few scenes of article 15 too ..... Pathetic scenes , can&#39;t imagine that human beings r so brutal .....
staying away from all these movied  specially the first one
NH10 and Badlapur were also pretty hard to watch, but I can&#39;t even think about watching the ones you mentioned here.
There is a Tamil movie kaadhal its climax is very disturbing. I couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days. And if course the whole movie of Welcome home was very disturbing
Watch love Sonia. You ll find series of jighly disturbing scenes  üò•üò•

T.w.: tradition &amp; rape<br><br>There&#39;s a tradition that is practised in Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, of woman being married to multiple men (polyandry), which is said to be based on the story of pandavas, and the name is also that (pandava). It was savdhaan India episode which made me aware of it.. (I had googled it as well just to confirm that I wasn&#39;t wrong -- for anyone who wants to know more, type &quot;polyandry in India&quot;).<br><br>And the scene at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTzb2LxhuKk&amp;t=192">3:12</a> actually caused me to google &quot;&quot;woman kept in cowshed to be raped by passers&quot;&quot;, which led me to this horrifying piece:<br><a href="https://m.timesofindia.com/city/bhopal/woman-kept-in-cowshed-raped-by-hubby-kin-in-mp/articleshow_comments/14683071.cms">https://m.timesofindia.com/city/bhopal/woman-kept-in-cowshed-raped-by-hubby-kin-in-mp/articleshow_comments/14683071.cms</a><br>P.s.: I googled only because I thought that the scene was inspired by some real life incident.
Udta Punjab was so artificial.
For me &#39;Tango Charlie&#39; when they tied young  Vishal Thakkar to a tree, tore his shirt apart and terribly starts cutting his chest with knife. Used him as bait to catch Indian Soldiers. That scene was horrifying.
Well the directors intentionally want these to be unbearable, I guess
There are even sceans in Akashvani which are hard to watch
Is it only me or anyone else also noticed that jammy voice is bit low compared to his normal entertaining voice?<br>Seems like he is having a sore throat or blocked nose.
I saw the movie Raman Raghav yesterday and that scene shocked me
Hi
Hu
I&#39;m never watching these movies now. Can&#39;t stomach such scenes
this was beyond disturbing and depressing
Trapped movie also makes uncomfortable
If you have watched got and the boys then these all are just a piece of cake
How could you forget that one scene from Bhaag Milkha Bhaag?
That movie about a 2 yr old in a house where her mom is dead...
Even two sequences in Bulbul: 1) the intellectually challenged brother raping the protagonist and 2) The husband of the protagonist beating her to breaking her legs. Unbearable.
I must say clickbait at its finest
I cried watching matrubhoomi i was so disappointed
Oh1947 earth has some of these really difficult to watch scenes too

You missed Bandit Queen , which will give you chills down your spine n nightmares  . Its disturbing n extremely difficult to watch
BA pass was disturbing too
You should watch paruthi veeran climax then
Andha Kanoon is another film
I am sure there are many more but the recent movie welcome home on Sony Liv is a bone chilling thriller and few scenes are gut wrenching
Here&#39;s one movie I want to suggest you to discuss in a video.. please give a chance to Laxmi by nagesh kukunur. It is an outstanding movie. And if you like it, kindly consider it to be included in your next video, for I think that kind of movies are really needed to be seen by the masses.
The movie AJJI was absolutely nerve shaking too.
Wow this channel is beautiful loved it‚ù§‚ù§
Video was fine.just change the title name to bollywood movies ü§£
Pedophilia scene from page 3 was very disturbing for me

Awesome üëç
Abe thoda hindi me b bol le,,, taake dusro ko b samaj aaye
I have watched matrubhoomi and as a women or any individual the entire movie was very very hard to watch for me. I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t even watch through scenes... It left me under its effect for days and the barbaric acts made its way to my mind for much longer period... I would recommend everyone to watch it once and see how much barbaric acts women(real/fictional) had to go through. If this doesn&#39;t give you chill or you find those scenes alluring then my friend you need a consultation.
Also the scene form bulbul when mahindar molest bulbul also when idranil molest her.... Extremely hard to watch....
SOTY2 and PATI PATNI AUR WOH was pretty hard for me to watch...

Such movies must not be shown in public ,yar aise hi itne criminals hai society me,uper se directors ,kaise aisi movies bana lete hai,such directors,story writes and actors themselves are dangerous for society....cinemas must be full of healthy and positive thought, and must reform the society but not promote criminal ideas to those criminal headsüôèüèª Anurag kashyap must stop making films ,his movies speak about  his sick mentality....
That ending scene from Saif and Urmila&#39;s &#39;Ek hasina thi&#39; was more disturbing to watch. Watching film from start you feel he deserve such treatment.

I thought you would include a movie- Laxmi. That is one hella disturbing movie. I was disturbed for so long after watching that movie. And I am a pretty thick skinned woman.
Matrabhumi was soo so disturbing that I wanted to forget the movie as it was stucked in my mind for few days and I hate this.. watching a women like this in the society and her value.. can&#39;t explain the feeling..worst than getting goosebumps...that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t recommend to anyone.
I really want to watch these but couldn&#39;t find these anywhere, especially Matrubhoomi. You should tell where to find these.
Could you also tell where to watch these movies?
You should watch ‚Äúwhat will people say‚Äù. Its an independent film with Indian actors based on a Norwegian- pakistani storyline which is true.
Watch the movie Lakshmi played by singer Monali Thakur where she had to please customers even while having high fever. Very disturbing

Chandani bar last 15 minutes...And of course Machis.
Anyone remember that scene from slumdog millionair when that guy  removes the eyes of that little girl while she was singing bhajan. That was quite disturbing too.
honestly i find almost every, yeah nearly each and every bollywood movie hard to watch.
Matrabhoomi was one of a kind..it left me with an intense feeling for days..I remember when I first saw the movie and in the end when Kalki decides to keep her daughter i was so frustrated..I could not believe that after going through soo much she had the courage to bring her daughter to that crude disgusting world.
Ae Dil Hain Mushkil was also pretty hard to watch

I wonder why the movie Hungry hasn&#39;t been included here.... The murder scenes were very difficult to watch....
Film &quot;Luxmi&quot; is based on true story. A 14 yr old girl is sold by her father into prostitution.. how she is compelled to do all of those nasty things that too with a smile.. when she tries to escape, she is caught and punished by Chinna, who also punishes the brothel head when she allows an NGO person  into brothel.. Those scenes are extremely hard &amp; uncomfortable to watch..

Bandit queen phoolon devi

Bollywood zyadatar ham Hindi language K log dekhte plz Hindi me bnaye hinglish bhi chalega but itti ni aati
All house full 1 2 3 are disturbing too
1947 earth . The climax scene where Rahul Khanna is killed and heroin is forcibly captured from her hidden place. It really leaves extremely bitter taste of partition
Thanks for suggesting movies üòµüòµ
Great content
Where can i watch the movie matrubhoomi- a nation without women. Can you please share the link ?
Katrina kaif hot scene with gulshan Grover was hard to watch for me.üò≠
Lajja movie hard to see
Many sequence from movie love sonia... very very hard to watch and gut wrenching
Siberian film was very hard to watch for me..<br>Though m habituated to blood and gore professionally
Your English accent is so good
I think U forgot to mention... about Sradha Kapoor&#39;s all movie.. oh god seriously hard to watch üòïüòüüòüüôÑüòî
I liked your ideas but they are the bitter face of our society like in films matrabhoomi and udta punjab these things should be finished from our society
What about laxmi üòûüòûüòûüòû
PADMAVAT was hard to watch...johar scene and shahid murder
These r all real incident ... There r no disturbing thing in these movie ..... These movies showing what is going onüò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
bhoomi rape scene - too difficult to watch
&#39;Laxmi&#39; should be there in the list.
roy
W T F ?
Rape scenes were so common in Hindi movies a few decades ago. It‚Äôs as if every director makes this list for a movie with 6 songs, 5 fights, 2 rape scenes.... they were quite graphic in nature as well. The one that I would not forget is a scene were a little girl gets raped. I saw it on tv and I myself was a little girl back then sadly.
I just cant imagine watching maatrbhoomi. Just listening the plot of story in this video gave me chills. I even cant understand that is in reality. Be it any religion women are just used by men on the name of customs, culture. Basically they want to fulfil their sexual desires behind such rape cum cultures.
Kareena ki overacting is hard to watch
Bollywood means casting couch, story less film, sex comedy, sleazy sex scene,
Change the title to hindi movies not  indian movies. Indian movie doesn&#39;t contain only hindi language movies.  There are many other languages too. Before doing any videos just research on the local environmental stuff and give the exact caption for that. Hereafter if you want to review hindi films specific the title like indian hindi films not like indian films.
Did the police man rape Omar with his stick?
I know kabir Singh is blockbuster movie but story and scene is so disturbing .It is not watchable movie.üòïüòïüòïüòïüòï

All balayya movies even more hard to watch
I really like the way you talk n your voice
roy movie was also hard to watch
The comments section!.... seriously?! ...
U should also add scenes of &quot; bandit queen&quot; where a child named Phoolan of about 5-7 years was  brutually exploited by her husband .. it was really hard to see.
Tried and refused production just an advice....Your presentation and voice is very good...so you dont need to use background  music so often or If u use, use different musics .....same music is being played in every video of yours....<br>just a progressive advice... Anyway I like your channel n contents very much...great going guys üëç
Salman Veer and Nargis fakhri Amavas really hard to watch
Pihu hard to watch movie
Kalank is the best film from Bollywood so far !
Hindi me bolo Bhai
I couldn&#39;t watch matrivumi <br>It was way too much painful to watch
One of the first movies that was recommended to me when I started watching Bollywood movies was Chandni Bar. After most of the happy-go-lucky movies I&#39;d seen from this industry, it was a hard watch. Especially the part where her uncle rapes her. And then continues to treat her like his niece, as though nothing had happened. It was horrifying because she had to continue to live with her rapist, who was also her uncle only because of lack of money.
Bandit Queen should be no. 1 in this list... Imagine how phoolan devi faced all that in reality
Matrabhoomi is actually very much hard to watch...  But it&#39;s the bare truth...
Lodhha..
Colombo ma aya bhoot india ki maaki chut
Based on true story movies, the  horrifying one<br>Mathrabhoomi seriously it&#39;s unbearable, it&#39;s curse to be born as female, am sorry saying out of depression and fear
Matrubhumi movie
Didnt found Bandit Queen in Ur List
Nice review....well researched
Sholey remake was very hard to watch
Raman Raghav 2.0 is a masterpiece. As usual awesome video dude keep it up !
Hey....you have some really good mindful content unlike other shitty bollywood news.......the other disturbing film i would like to mention is &quot;laxmi&quot; by monali thakur.....the trailor itself is soo disturbing that i didnt watch the movie.....i was expecting that one in your list unless i an wrong.....
I have watched Matrabhoomi but still it sends chill down my spine... To watch movie like this it needs courage and I got to know after watching it... One of most disturbing scene was when she was pregnant and put in I don&#39;t know what kind of place but still those bloody men didn&#39;t stop... It was terrible... I just cried after watching it kind of felt like depressed...
I feel like puking just by listening. I would definitely have puked if i had watched any of these.
Abey angrej hindi me bak
Soty2 hard to watch
link v diya kro yar........
That is crucial to watch but bitter truth of society
Randgyachya DEEPA
I have watched all of these movies...and these were far ahead of the current era of bollywood.
Watching the full movie PIHU deserves a bravery award.
Hey cutie ! üíú
If you have not seen Hostel series by Tarantino you have seen nothing

You have a nice voice

Murder 2... The scene where the girl pees
Jammy you are just love. ü•∞‚ô•Ô∏èman loved it . The crispy voice
U r voice is so good and soothing
Keep criticizing sexually explicit films. And keep using those same sex clips to increase your viewership. Hypocrite
Matrabhoomi was abosuletly horrifying to watch üòê
R u hesitate to speak in Hindi?....hindi m h he Bollywood movies....think twice...
What about ugly, it should also be included...
Plz make a video on Kannada Movies
I am still stunned to know about these movie, I will not dare watch any of those. It&#39;s disturbing for rest of my life.
ThUgs Of Hindustan WaZ Hard to Watch Aswell...üôÑ
Murder 2
love the comments!
UGLY has perhaps most shocking end in the history of Hindi Cinema.
Even zero was hard to watch
Why on my recommendation üò•üò•üòìüòìüò≠üò§
Dhoom3 ...thugs...race3...krishh3....... usually most big budget Bollywood movies make me mortified after watching themüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And Nawazbhai says this is nothing much the reality more absurd than what they show in movies
How come Anurag Kashyap&#39;s Ugly isn&#39;t on the list??  That ending gave me nightmares for days.
Shootout at wadla Haksar brothers killing yakaub
Watch NH 10..
U forget to mention the famous movie Bandit Queen. Some scenes feels Pretty disgusting to watch.
U missed movie Ugly.. it was perfect for its title
Yes
Nude scence are needed in Bollywood.
after sandeep maheshwari, this channel has no clickbaits
If you have guts then watch Urf Professor
I will add lakshmi movie to this category
what abt &quot;Sanju&quot; the toilet scene ..it really takes guts to show that man
Mardaani me bhi ek scene hai..
https://youtu.be/qkVMNsddKvw
If these you find hard to watch.....go try watching wrong turn or hostel series.....
Girl in yellow boots.
bakwas  video banana band kar.
Seriously guys put the damn scene instead of explaining,you talking doesn&#39;t generate much interest
Wow.. I dont know the actor&#39;s name (other than rahul bose) but he played a gay man in made in heaven too, right.. (and also played rahul gandhi in Accidental Prime Minister, just saying) üòÖ
Jab herry met sejal also hard to watch
<b>Although I am curious, I don&#39;t think I want to watch it.....</b>
You missed Race-3 and thugs of Hindustan....it was very hard and disturbing to watch
Raman raghav had some of the best actors and movie is really good if you are habited to whatch psychotic movies totally recommend
Udta punjab was ok. Scenes from bandit queen are hard to watch.
Shakti movie starring Karishma Kapoor and Newyork starring Katrina Kaif Neil Nitin Mukesh and John were difficult to watch.
Matrubhumi is really a shocking movie for me. I can&#39;t hold my tears whenever I watch this movie. Tulip done a great job in this movie. It&#39;s a mile stone movie I think. My grand salute to the director who made this kind of social movie. Everybody should watch this movie.
u missed Lajja...even thts a difficult movie to watch
Thugs of hindustan was very hard to watch, especially when u buy tickets for 300 ‚Çπ
How can you forget the movie Lakshmi. Absolutely disgusting and cringe worthy scenes. Too much to stomach for anybody
Baar baar dekho was also hard to watch because it was so boring...
You must watch the movie &quot;Laxmi&quot;
matrabhoomi was really hard to watch...Just after father in law I couldn&#39;t watch anymore..
Laxmi was also very difficult to watch
For me, one of the most disturbing scenes is from the movie Lajja where the character of Rekha gets &quot;punished&quot; for the intercaste marriage of his son. What&#39;s even more ruthless is the fact that it is based on a true event.
Where is Bandit Queen?
Ugly and Titli missing in the list
Tees mar Khan was also very hard to watch....
As u mention some movie scenes like matrabhumi,i am, and all r difficult to watch bt think abt d people who r victims of such unbearable incidents.
Really like ur all content... <br>No bull shit <br>No drama <br>No masala.
Matrabhoomi is a fucking classic. Y&#39;all need to give it a watch. <br>Harrowing, disturbing, and extremely thought provoking. That was good cinema.
I have no issues watching all these scenes. They were great, we need more cinema like this so people can get some idea what goes on in india
I am sad to see that actors like Salman Khan / Katrina Kaif /Sonam Kapoor are appreciated over actors like Kalki / Konkona Sen / Rahul Bose / Nawazuddin Siddiqi. <br><br>We can complain all we want about Bollywood dealing more with masala entertainers and commercial films, but it is we who make them commercial. These great actors do not get their due credit. <br><br>I have personally decided to purchase the ticket for any movie made by the &quot;good&quot; actors and great films. Even if I don&#39;t find the time to watch them. Just to lend them my support.
These movies are hard to watch coz they r close to reality... and these things happens to ppl in real life..... when u think about those ppl who have suffered and who r still going through such situations in their life ... just gives u shudders..... ... may God give happy and healthy life to every1 and keeps them away from such horrible situations....
Thugs was  so hard to watch
I watched bandit queen in the theater. After that I could not sleep for 2 to 3 nights, I was so shaken.
why won&#39;t feminists help them??!
Prem ratan dhan payo
What happened to Karishma kapoor in shakti movie was really hard to watch.

This is reality of our society.....think about those who went through all these trauma n harrassment in real.
Richa chadda and mishra scene in gangs of wasseypur
Dushman was also such movie....great acting by ashutosh rana...
I saw a movie scene couldn&#39;t remember its name .. was a horror one which amitab saw in a mirror a man and told his friend and he couldn&#39;t watch it .. swear to god although that was simple scene but I couldn&#39;t sleep at that moment so intense
There‚Äôs another movie by the name ‚Äúwhat will people say‚Äù. I guess not an Indian movie... I just remember I had to skip scenes coz it was getting really difficult to watch the situation shown there.
All salman khan movies hard to watch
You missed Rakhi and Deepak kalal in the list
Where&#39;s hostel&#39;s rape scene of the student ?

Matrbhoomi is very very hard to watch ...

Star kids who chose not to do movie

Why pronounce Raman&quot;aa&quot; when you know it and pronounce Raman
You forget Aamir&#39;s Dhobi Ghat  it&#39;s also hard to watch. Is movie ko jitna bhi dekha usk baad to Aamir Khan se nafrat ho Gayi.
Another Tulip Joshi movie Dhokha should&#39;ve been in the list. Watch Anupam Kher, Ashutosh Rana and Tulip Joshi in the scene where Ashutosh Rana Abuse Tulip Joshi in front of her helpless father Anupam Kher and her brother. This scene made me feel what effect disturbing scenes may have in one&#39;s mind.
Krk orgasm scene in Deshdrohi when he is hit by bullet is way  hard to watch
Didn&#39;t know Page 3 was about pedophilia ring. I always ignored the movie as a kid when it would play on TV thinking it would be about something stupid like love and or fashion.
Ending scene of movie baabarr
You forgot to add fatima&#39;s fight scenes from thugs of hindostan
interesting fact: sushant shigh rajput was in the movie matrubhumi<br>just fount out!!
Gangajal aankh dikhata hai madarjaat is also hard to watch.
These movies show real face of Indian culture
Currently i would say i thought of going to pihu but couldn&#39;t, that movie with that little girl talking to dead bodies in movie was way to difficult for me to watch.
Your video starting pic( I forgot    what actually we can it) is from the movie mathrabhoomi-A nation without a women, everyone should watch that movie it&#39;s amazing<br>.
Dolly&#39;s (Kareena)  murder in Omkara is also hard to digest . your heart forgets to beat .

Oh omg
&#39;Bawandar&#39;, &#39;Thanks maa&#39; &amp; &#39;Bandit queen&#39; should be mentioned
Watch <br><br>All<br>Bala&#39;s movies <br><br>You&#39;ll find his movies more disturbing than ever
i think hamshakal movie and himmatwala (2013) was the wrost ever movie i had watch in my entire life. really those are toughest to watch.
i think salman khan&#39;s dance and action scenes from the movie dabang and dabang 2 are really funny and also very difficult to watch. and if salman starts dancing no one can stop me to leave the movie. even i think i was single person in the world who scape from the theater during 1/3 part  of movie tubelight is playing.
Get treated by an ent dude<br>.u have an irritating voice ..
Omg literally it&#39;s unbearable.

Nawazuddin is a god of acting
All of Bollywood is disturbing now<br>It&#39;s all vile and sados and even the big so called stars are full of shit<br>Bollywood is an embarrassment now
I ve watched the movie matrubhoomi.....It&#39;s really disgusting the way the girl is treated.....And also it&#39;s shows the reality which is still going on ....
anyone who says alia bhatt is just a untalented starkid should watch udta punjab because not many actresses could do what she did so amazingly
Thugs of Hindustan also hard to watch
Jab tak hindustan mei cinema hai tab tak logo ka kuch nahi ho paayega
Sorry all bollywood movies are hard to watch for me.
Salman Khan films are hard to watch

Matrubhumi really very hard n harsh to watch n it is very disturbing to c
Where could I watch matroobhumi online?
This guy tried&amp;refusedproductions never going to criticize the shitty and overacted movies of SRK like OSO, HNY, Chennai Express, Ra one, Fan, MNIK, Dilwale, RNBJ, JTHJ and many more, they are really hard to watch.. One Suggestion to the people of this channel &quot;don&#39;t be soo biased that people have to acknowledge this publically&quot;
It&#39;s pronounced as o-maar, not o-mar.

Heyy why don&#39;t you come one on one with your audience..we need to see you and how u go about finding content and stuff like that
Nice work. I am going to watch these movies soon, they seem to have a strong impact and understanding.
thugs of hindustan is hard to watch.
Emran haamis films are hard to watch
Raman raghav was highly overrated because of idiots like you !
nawazuddin siddiqi always gives off an ashutosh rana vibe. Brilliant actor
Salman Khan show big boss is also hard to watch ,there is nothing in that show that is positive .....
RIP  courage! If movies are hard to watch imagine the plight of people who go through it and imagine the plight of people who are witnessing these victim&#39;s pain in order to heal them. These scenes in the movies are difficult to watch yes but how about learning something from them and collectively fight the social evils n the menace ?
An escape from afghanistan too manisha koirala‚Äôs movie
I can see the amount of effort you take to make these videos. Amazing job man!!!

Love Sex aur Dhokha directed by Dibakar Banerjee. The scene where a boy and his girlfriend were killed for inter caste marriage
Don&#39;t know whether I should like the compilation.. but then Bandit Queen was also disturbing and I couldn&#39;t sit through Raman Raghav coz it was scary
You need to make another video on the same topic to include difficult scenes from Chandana Bar, Bhawandar and Ugly to name a few.
make video on worst and best result of nepotism
For a moment i thought it was shirish kunders pic
For me Sangarsh was one of the most scariest movie
These are reality......
Raman Raghav 2.0 basically was a movie that people should hate, if you hate the movie that means it&#39;s a great movie....
The reason why Tried and Refused Productions is better than Triggered Insaan. Because of its sophistication and better tastes and in general much more refined understanding of what cinema is all about. Great video.
This also includes cruel rape scene from premgrantha.
Can anyone explain what was hard to watch in scene 3 (Page 3). I am unable to understand.
your english is good.<br>you should start an english teaching channel.
This channel is in my binge watch list now. Great insights man.
Lakhsmi is also too hard to watch
Ghajini, lipstick under my burkha...
Yamla pagla deewana phir se!! üò∞üòµüòßüò¨üò±üò° Trailer makes me cringe
Maatrabhoomi was disturbing and stayed with me for a long time where every one is raping the lead actress repeated in the stable.sridevi produced movie.<br>Raman ragvan was definitely scary to watch.<br>Udta Punjab with alia scene was again wtf...<br>Page 3 was disturbing with the scene mentioned and makes you think these things actually is going on.<br>I am movie not watched.
Badlapur was also a very disturbing one specially when varun dhavan kills radhika apte nd her husband
Murder 2 ?? It should be the number 1 hard to watch movie. Gay man killing women. Ugggggh that movie is beyond disturbing and disgusting.
Except mathrubhumi nothing is disturbing at all. I hope You haven&#39;t seen any disturbing Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam movies. Not even one I guess
Movie Nasha has such scenes
matrabhumi is gut wrenching ive seen it
ever thing was going well until the 1st one.
Make a video on best movies which become flop in theaters
Realty is more hard to watch
I would have never come across matrubhoomi , if I hadn&#39;t watched this video. Thank you so much. It was great.
I have seen most of it.And I must those are some really tough scenes to <a href="http://watch.you/">watch.You</a> could have bandit Queen&#39;s Seema Biswas getting raped by whole village to this list.That was almost <a href="http://unbearable.it/">unbearable.It</a> was like reality was being shoved down your throat.
Good work :) as always.... <br>But u should have mentioned <br>Rajeev  Khandelwal starer Amir  too...
RGV ki Aag should be in list
U missed B.A pass
Reshma death scene from murder 2
I don&#39;t know why people think nawaz uddin siddikee is a great actor he is doing same roles since gowp till s.g what&#39;s the difference in all his movie he is a illiterate f***er in his all movies
Raman Raghav was Good but after watching i got distubed after watching
hey jammy, is &#39;I AM&#39; available for free on hotstar? or is it for premium members only?
How could you miss UGLY...the ugliest movie that i watched
You&#39;ve no idea what an ordeal it was to watch <b>Main prem ki diwaani Hun</b>   &amp; that too in a theatre.üò™
You missed Humsakals ,the entire movie was a horror
Angrej ki aulad
Ghajini murder scene was really disturbing to watch. Still in my brain after all these years
I actually turned off my laptop when that scene in Raman raghav came. I really couldn&#39;t sit through it.
Lakshmi is  one of the great movie that i have watched
Now 377 is nomore so no problem
Your voice is amazing and video too... love u üòò
Jammy Pants seems to find a perverse pleasure in dissecting such unsavory sequences
There was a movie in which Tabu told her husband he has raped her many times. Can anyone tell me the name
You missed Un-freedom. It was pretty much banned in India, but you can still find some copies on the internet. It dealt with subjects like Communism and Homosexuality. What makes it unbearable is when a father orders his daughter to be raped right. IN. FRONT. OF. HIS. EYES. by his colleagues.<br><br>Ewww.
Nargis fakhri acting is hard to watch for me.üòñüòµü§ßüò∑ü§ï
Most hard to watch is  The Wrong Turn series..ever..
Heyy What about Mardaani???<br>It&#39;s so difficult to watch thats movie
deshdrohi was unbearable from casting scene itself
There was an 80s movie. Meri Awaz Suno. It was poorly made but near the end, there was a scene where a 9 month pregnant Hemamalini (filmed when she actually was pregnant) gets pounded repeatedly in the belly to the point where she aborts and dies in front of her husband (Jitendra). That was absolutely gruesome.
Top 5 best action sequences in Bollywood

Tera bakvas video that extremely hard to watch
I am so uncomfortable after watching this video yaar
Matrabhoomi and Raman raghav scenes have been mentioned already in other video.
Udta Panjab Is Really Disterbung
Reading the comments I think to be justified to all these kind of astonishing movies to still got to highlight multiple such movies that means you have to make some more parts on this topic.
I think you miss gajni
<b>Humshakals</b> was pretty hard to watch TBH...
Just watched Matrubhoomi ... It was painful and suffocating as hell

RR 2.0 was really difficult to watch and bone chilling.
Himesh Reshmiya&#39;s movies are hard to watch too.
Matrubhoomi is the combination of two real stories India........So, 100% movie is truth based
Fuck Bollywood
Jemmy ....you forgot to mention thanks maa....the climax scene of that movie was unbearable....
Bollywood me kuch bacha nahi to old songs ki copies karti hai ya sex scene dalti hai.
Some scenes from <br>-Titli<br>-Masan<br>-Thanks ma (Climax) <br>Definitely deserve a spot or a honorable mention.
A video on actresses rubbishy makeovers that still didnt do anything for them; ameesha patel in lazy lamhe, kim sharma in all films, rimi sen in dhoom and kajols sister in neal and nikki i dnt even kno her name üò≠üòÇüòÇ
To be honest I really enjoyed ur videos

Again ill pronunciations of hindi names and words. Young these days think pronouncing hindi words in english accent is new cool.
Can you please please please please make a video on Sacred games
Alia is so talented !
Matrbhoomi, omg, didn&#39;t knew a movie like that exists. And a disgusting culture like that! Don&#39;t have the spine though to watch that.
The Bombay blast scene from Black Friday.
You forgot every salman khan movie ever made.
I mean more videos about it... You have done one yet I&#39;ve seen it....
Plz make a video about some psychological movies....
I like the music when video is starts...
U missed bandit queen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTzb2LxhuKk&amp;t=155">2:35</a> &quot;Not knowing where the kids are situated&quot;<br>Wow. <br>English.
Alia Bhatt in Udta Punjab looks like first girlfriend of CJ in GTA San Andreas üòÇ
Add bandit queen, where phoolen is raped by an entire village. That&#39;s the most disgusting/disturbing scene I&#39;ve ever seen.
U missed kalyug... so disturbing.
I was expecting Lipstick Under my Burkha to be on this list due to the marital rape scenes of Konkona in the movie
Bandit Queen....the entire movie is difficult to watch
5 movies that could have been better
Should have also added the movie &#39;trapped&#39; to your list above. Rajkumar Rao has acted so well in the movie that some of the scenes make you feel equally helpless and make you cringe and whine! Do watch it and consider.
I too felt the same with these movies. Whenever I switch on tv and these scenes come up, I somehow switch the channel till its gone. Its truly disturbing.
This channel deserves more then million subscribers , it&#39;s not only about entertainment but also take us to the best side and works that has been done by our people . Many of us just pretend themselves as only hollywood viewers coz india do not not make good films , dude u just have to follow this guy&#39;s channel .
Dude,<br>it&#39;s 5 Shocking <b>Bollywood</b> Movie Scenes Extremely Hard To Watch
You missed out 1947 Earth- the scene where a man was dragged out of his house, legs tied to two jeeps and pulled.. The violence &amp; horror of the Partition in the movie  is extreme
You forgot Bandit Queen. Hope you have seen the film
Hello JammyPants!<br>You know what else is ignored in thd Bollywood? These films do not get enough credit, accolades or nominations for the actors and directors. Sad
U alwys ask for video ideas bt god damn u urslf have so many mind blowing ideas i must say i am in love with u man ‚ù§‚ù§
Jammy today I finished sacred games. <br>Literally screamed in every murder. I&#39;m shaking and those chutiya mc bc is coming in every sentence. I want some light movie to forget those murders üò£üò£üò£üò£
End of raman rhagav 2.O is worst than I think
You missed murder 2.....
You r awesome
In parched climax scene when radhika apte&#39;s character is brutly beaten by her husband is also very Tough to watch
98% of the Bollywood is delusional!! And rest 2% , well you can see on this video!!
Bandit Queen should have been in the list tooüëç
This is one no-nonsense channel. Great work, keep it up. By the way, congratulations for the 377K subscribers üòÅüòÅ
totally agree with  Matrabhoomi..I watched that movie 4-5 years ago but I still cant come out of it. Tulip Joshi has done a amazing work in that movie.
You missed Lakshmi movie by Nagesh Kukunoor
I actually expected Agneepath
I Am not Am I
I think Gajni should have been listed in this video
Judwaa 2 was extremely hard to watch
377 k subscriber...what a coincidence...
Before watching ur videos... I GIVE A BIG THUMPS UP.... U R FABULOUS...
Oh man! I am already feeling a bit uneasy
Murder 2 was also very violent and disturbing.
correct üëç
U forgot to mention bandit queen, unfreedom and BA paas
A very good list.....but I must say u missed a few.....children of war is one movie which is terrifying to watch....the scene in which tilotima shome z gangraped and then mercilessly murdered plus a scene in which women are thrown from the truck , stripped,half of them are kept for raping and the othert half z brutally murdered was the hardest thing I have seen
What about the movie<br>Masaan???
I am is censored on hotstar üòê
Ur so cute
Unfreedom????
King of exaggeration and superlatives
was having chat with a friend. he says women are turning men and men into women. example of men turning into women , this channel&#39;s narrator I am reminded of
Salman Khan movies like Race 3, PRDP and Bodyguard was also hard to watch
These  films are supposed to be respected more than the garbage stuffs of Salman, srk and all the newcomers
niceüòÄ
Please Make List Of Those Bollywood Movies Which Is Unbearable Watch A Single Bit Despite Having Huge Star!!!!!!!
You forgot all the tota üïä scenes in  main prem ki deewani hoonüòÇüòÇ<br>Awesome list again tho..

Tubelight was hard to watch, kyu k tube kharab tha
These movies are really disturbing...
You spoke about the Raman Raghav disturbing scene in another video too. Why repeated content?? Do you need some ideas??
That is sick really
Either you forgot or you haven&#39;t seen the scenes of Om Puri and MALLIKA Sharawat from THE DIRTY POLITICS! üò£
Anurag kashyap can really bring out.. true actor... From any individual... <br>Great director..
I guess the scene from Bandit queen is also unbearable, where she is raped by several men after her capture.
Badlapur sequence as well
Please mention it as only bollywood or like this indian movies(bollywood).. if u mention indian films then must include movies from all languages

If you watched &quot;Sairat&quot; then watching &quot;Dhadak&quot; is hard and disturbing to watch...!!!
According to Genetics male female ratio should be 1:1 when the ratio goes bad things like this (matribhumi) happen.
Omerta ??
It&#39;s always a treat to listen to your amazing Bollywood analysis...im a fan of your mind boggling vocabulary üòç
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23matrubhoomi">#MATRUBHOOMI</a> üòü
Irfan Khan and Priyanka Chopra&#39;s lovemaking scenes in 7 Khoon Maaf was most disturbing to watch. Oh God it was so uncomfortable.
That is one of my videos tumbnail. Indeed good work.

Mohenjo Daro was so hard to watch.... I didn‚Äôt even watch it.
What a list ‚òùüëåüëåüëå<br>You should be a full time film criticü§ò
Fiction is hard to watch fact is unbearable, unbelievable, unethical, heartshattering and I don&#39;t know what words describe the way one should feel after watching news nowadays..
You should experiment on the way of delivery of dailoges and the presentation of the list<br>Its been a long time and i am kind of bored and feel like its the same content repeating although its not !
What about those movies which are also hard to watch like race 3, Ram Gopal Verma ki Aag,etc etc üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Thanks bro you always gives me movie goals...this time is matrbhumi and i am... others were already watched
I would have thought Jaago would have been mention. I saw that movie once on tv. And I found that child gang rape scene extremely hard to watch. And then I found out later that movie was based on a true real life incident. Made me regret of ever taping that movie. But after that one time of seeing the movie. I decided never to watch that movie again.
Include LOVE Sonia
Katrina Kaif &#39;S all movies are hard to watch.
Make a video on brilliant writer
Make a video on most amazing bollywood  comedy movies of all time please... my favorite is dhamaalüòä

Love your channel because it&#39;s so much accurate all the time!
Ever heard of unfreedom?
Subscribed Ur channel bro
I am was really disturbing as it was a crime to be gay.. But after SC verdict on 6th September 2018 it&#39;s not punishable crime now.. Police can charge them of hvin sex in public.. Just as normal heterosexual ppl.
Pls make a video on movies like oldboy (2003)
Even your subscribers are 377.......k
Brilliant ! And you should have added Omerta movie, where Omar cuts the journalist&#39;s throat
Btw what&#39;s the track you play in the intro???
You missed some scenes from Ugly movie and Raman Raghav is one of the best Psychological thrillers
The final 15 minutes of Parinda... That was damn haunting (Not disgusting). Many sequences from the attack of 26/11..
Jammy bro I watched Raman Raghav 2.0 after watching your previous video on it .. and damn yar it really is good üôà..I mean it&#39;s creepy but still awesome .. but it&#39;s underrated üíî
Varun all moives are hard to watch
it is hard to watch murder movie villain
Lovely video
A very good and trustworthy promising channel
I can&#39;t get Raman raghav movie out of head still. Aweosme acting by Nawaz. Also in Udta Punjab when Alia eats food when locked in room is hard to watch. Need to watch Omar, never heard of this movie before. Good video btw.
