Which smartphone should I switch to now?
Lol
This is why foldable dual screen phones are a BAD idea, I&#39;m sure a lot of us knew that before they came out.
I think the world is ready now 2 years later we now have the fold 3 and at the end of this current year 2021 we will get the galaxy fold dual and hopefully the galaxy smart ar glasses! If your from the future say hi to my old ass!😁👌
When folded , looks like holding 2 phone
Does this &quot;not have enough room for a headphone jack&quot; as well? I hate these corporations with their excuses.
Who’s remember this garbage hhhhhh god I feel petty to people who bought it hhhhhhh
LG v50 🖤 it&#39;s a dual screen option I know you did a video on it already but it was awesome
MY HUAWEI MATE X PRO is on another lavel.

Nothing can&#39;t be fixed by some duck tape ,
The sad music in the backround
I&#39;m from 2067 I figured out there is gonna be a phone that can turn into anything u could imatineO:
i would say folding it back and forth being addictive is actually a negative... more wear and tear on the screen
Hi daddy
weren&#39;t you suppose to just point out the issues and say goodbye, what are you blabbering about!!! seems like got your heartbroken!
He didn&#39;t want to let go his baby SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD LMAO
Aww he was so in love with his baby SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD LMAO
It looks like if the fold was horizontal then it would fix the closed phone skinniness
Ihr seid der Burner... Ich liebe eure Videos... Macht weiter so... 💪😎👑
Its hilarious you complain about the keyboard in its closed position .... I have an iPhone SE with a 4 inch screen and i can text on that ALL DAY LONG WITH NO ISSUES so having a 4.3 inch display, I myself don&#39;t see an issue with texting on that front screen...<br><br>I believe the issue is YOU, normally having a larger 5+ inch screen as your main and only screen to deal with, your used to texting on a larger screen and this SMALLER screen is only 4.3 inches so your not used seeing a smaller keyboard so its awkward now .. <br><br>Its no different from driving a full sized chevy suburban then dropping to a Mini Cooper ... <br><br>I saw this phone in person at best buy and i was seriously impressed. The audio was impressive, YES i saw the middle partition but only if i LOOKED for it, otherwise when i was playing a video, i didn&#39;t see that crease ....
lets wait how apple will do a folding phone
ننننننتتنتتتتتءباباء
Its already have been re released
Now never remove the screen protector thinking its a useless thing its very important for the function of the device just never peel that off for satisfactions ok
I was literally playing the background song in my piano
At least Samsung is always ahead of Apple
What&#39;s the title of the background song?
The idea of this is to fit a smartphone and a tablet in your pocket.  The mate x did better because of the larger modern display that we are accustomed to today.  We need this kind of technology, tablet and smartphone in one
With all those things and bad things aside the phone is a really great and nice product
Ohh no !! Im crying right now are u crying to??

Hmmm instead of bending the screen, why not roll it? You can call it the Samsung scroll. Either way I think rolling the screen would be less damaging than bending it

Let&#39;s see the PIXEL 4 XL, unless you already did it and I haven&#39;t found it. Anyway I was interested in this &#39;fold&#39; to replace my long-standing iPhone lineage. Apple iPhone has become boring and the interface is now dated.
That phone is a joke 2000 dollar piece of shit

I still don&#39;t get this, just get a tablet. I like the idea of roll up screen so we cane have something like Earth: Final Conflict communicators(less bulky though) or even wearable.
This phone is gonna create some porn addictions.
Cool Samsung, All the best. Very natural and normal for new technologies to fail initially. Hope you will come out of these teething problems ASAP and release this phone. Yes it will be costly today, but with mass production I am sure the price will come down,
Im watching the ads to get you the money back
Dude it am small youtuver
I dont kmow why you so baised if apple do this <br>You always say bad about them yr common not fair <br>If apple hv problem thn is too much <br>You always say its expansive so dont buy okay <br>You are tyoe of people you always use iphone but they dont give you money so they bad

That thing is just ugly! It&#39;s too thin when folded and the folded display is a joke, how anyone at Samsung approved this for release is beyond me. There is no need for a phone that folds, this was just Samsung rushing something to the market so they can say they did it first. So much money wasted on R&amp;D on this stupid thing and it&#39;s not going to sell.....
Samsung note 10 pro
I would like the new version of the Samsung Galaxy Fold to have a bigger screen when the phone is unfolded so you can use it easly
This phone will really change user interfaces for websites
I absolutely love Samsung but this phone is just shit. No offense
Im a bricklayer. Monday going to get it. See how long will it last with me.

There was a better way of designing this phone. Instead of a flex screen that creases, they should’ve used three separate pieces of bias cut Gorilla Glass, a small sliver piece in the center cut in a bias on either side to (almost) seamlessly join them. Of course, that would essentially be three separate screens and the synchronization would possibly be an issue at first. But honestly, I can’t deal with the crease. Plastic, no matter how durable, especially with pixels involved, is going to look horrible.

I just think that if people drop 2k for a foldable phone. their pretty much morons, listen people its alott better and smarter to wait, a few years then go after the said phone. you want after all the issue&#39;s, are taken out. witch in all honesty. the manufacturer&#39;s should not put a phone, on the market itll they can 100% guarantee. itll work as advertised. if not no point on putting it on the market. dumbass/ignorant move. yes, i have the LG stylo 4 brand spanking new. but, news flash it isnt fold. so no unrealistic issue&#39;s. p.s. the battery only lasts 16+ ish hours. but, thats fine. the equalizer is outrageously amazing, with listen to all my favorite songs from numerous artists its awesome. The sound is better than beats quality. but you have to know how to customize sound. like me but anyhow my point is. dont go after a<br>Impractical phone. like, that knew phone that is all touch thats mimicking the iconic razor phone. from Motorola pretty dumb making that phone as well and putting a price tag, 1.5k. like are you serious? dont advertise a phone unless you know for a fact itll make it. Thankyou.
OK u said that u think that phone is the future but now I are sayin the world is not ready
Lg did a better dual screen with the v50. Too bad lg sucks with their implementation and marketing. It&#39;s More functional than this &quot;durable&quot; brick
Samsung galaxy s10+ or huawei psmart
ofcourse its a luxury device! Jeez its 2000 dollars!
Um how about the iPhone 5c lol
Kyocera echo came out in 2011 with a similar concept.
I feel like it should have been made to reverse flip so when it closes it has like a beyond infinity screen or something
BLU r2 Plus 2019
So... A phone and a tablet combined? I’ll stick with my IPhone Xr
start using a jailbroken iPhone.

<b>galaxy fold is just a flip phone that turns into a bigger flip phone</b>

Throughout history we know that every one just want a regular phone, maybe a 6.2 screen phone, but for them fold phone, just give it up they all havr fail... I remember years way back sprint launch one folding phone with company i dont remember, but i bough it and it was a disaster.

your ads are what gave you the thumbs down
Samsung would have my heart if they just killed FUCKING BIXB Y yy

A phone that fold like that not worth getting anyways and it cost too much.

How about switching to the &quot;Fairphone 2&quot;?

Yeah it is a very cool phone to flex since not many people can afford it
You should get a iPhone 2g

Use the newest HTC flagship phone. Those guys are not getting enough love and they have the most practical features packed in for real world use in my opinion

순실전자 댓글알밥 총동원했네 ㅋㅋ 존나한심
How is this show useful, he is always switching phones and fan boying over tech just because it is new.
Recall alert!
You should use the htc desire 12+<br>I got 4 weeks use out of mine. Even though it is currently an international only phone you can use it on an att network with 3g and some 4g and gsm networks only. Make sure the sim card goes in sim tray slot one or you will not get the network to work lol. I used the phone for about 4 weeks. Being around 200 dollars its ok. The battery life is like the best I have ever seen. The battery barely drained using YouTube for several hrs. It has a premium feel to it with the same elegant smooth design as the pricier htc u12 flagship phones which is nice. It has a really good fingerprint scanner. It can even scan a dirty finger and recognize it. It has a good bokeh feature on the camera app The power button as groves and the volume button is smooth so you do not accidentally hit one  or the other button, a feature more phones need to implement in design. It has an impressively light feel to it for being so big. When you start up the phone you have to navigate a foriegn language and try to get to a setting to change that to English due to it being an outside the us sold by htc phone. You do get a pop up stating the phone complies with EU standards Meaning European Union which means that the phone will have much better security options available than a non EU phone which I grew to quickly love and was the one thing I miss. The bad side of the phone after 2 weeks I started to notice the fingerprint sensor not responding as many times  meaning more times where I had to use the on screen password or code option. The camera is very unstable and overly sensitive and the tiniest movements cause a blurred or just plain bad image to occur. Like all bad designs the speaker is three holes on the bottom of the phone with poor sound compared to other phones. Talking on a phone call I had to repeat things or be louder constantly so the onther caller could hear. The phone on att prepaid had random connectivity issues and network blackouts while in a good cell coverage area which should not have happened since the phone was factory unlocked and gsm unlocked. The big number one issue I had is that the phone is not the slightest bit durable. Only one Fall ever no scratches  on bangs just one fall. One fall while slowly on my bycycle going slow as possible spider craked the screen and rendered the phone useless as this also caused connectivity issues big time aswell and at this point the fingerprint scanner no longer works after the fall lol. My Samsung j3 2016 from back in the day was cheaper and could handle many falls and scrapes like a pro. I am a fitness guru and since ditching the disappointing Htc Desire 12+ I switched to the recently new Samsung active series and love my Samsung galaxy A6 so much. I guess it was a final attempt to try and love htc once more and either siltick with them or forget them forever. I remember yrs ago having an htc desire 536 with super loud speakers and incredible specs for its time for between 55 and 70 dollars. Htc has had thier share of issues and will probably face more as the company heads on a scary downward slope to maybe its final collapse as htc struggles to try everything its got to stay in the game. And it doesn&#39;t have much. Anyway. Its an excellent starter phone. Would not recommend it as your daily driver if you have had other phones. Switched back to trustworthy good ol Samsung. HTC is now nothing more than a memory.
when i grow up i wanna work to samsung becouse i have alout of idias
huawei p30 pro<br>before its to late<br>when you bought already the phone you can get updates from google<br>but if you didn&#39;t buy it after the august you won&#39;t have any updates<br>so attention guys: don&#39;t sell you current phones before august that is still working <br>i have my huawei nova 3i<br>and i have my update yesterday and it will be updated from google forever because i&#39;ll explain again just backread what i said tho🙂
so if you need it to go back to samsung<br>are they giving 100% refund?
I think you should put you sim card in Nokia 3310 best phone ever<br>It have games ,radio and you can use it as hammer and it doesn&#39;t explode
I meam the camera is cool but hows the pornhub. Bet you didnt think to try that out.
How sad. I wish it would last forever.
WE HAVE TO APPRECIATE SAMSUNG. FOR BRAVENESS TO CEEATE THIS PHONE.

I hate the phone
My phone never did this all u did this especially to make a bad review video
Huawei mate x is better
Just shows that these big companies are only in it for the money how can they try and charge you two grand for something that is totally not built right ,how can a big company like Samsung miss all these defects
I hope that the next version (not the repaired, but next year&#39;s) will have a stylus. It seams like the perfect device for it. I don&#39;t have a note, but I do have the Galaxy book 12, and a stylus is amazing.
1st... Nokia 9300 is NOT a folding screen. Yes it folded but not at the screen. C&#39;mon people. 2nd Samsung calling back a product is a great thing, morally speaking, not letting consumers to spend money on a product that is not going to last. $2k is still ridiculous but if u have it, do you. Great review guys... Switch to Nokia 3300 would be hilarious for a week. Surprise to see if it still works. L8r bro
i am a careful person, but i work in a really dusty and dirty enviroment so the ip68 rating is almost a must, and with frequent work outside which do from time to time take place in the rain would a phone that isn&#39;t waterresistant be at risk big time. i used to have a phone without ip68 and it is proper destroyed from all the dust and water it had to endure
I didn’t see something suck that bad since the power glove.
That thing sucks ass. Stop sugar coating it.
FIRST THE NOTE 7! NOW THE GALAXY FOLD? LEAVE THE FRAGILENESS TO APPLE, THERE PROS AT LESS DURABILITY
Try mate X
Nokia brick plz
Guys, check out Meritmeter for this review, it has ratings too.

I will never buy samsung again! They sold me a crap t.v and won&#39;t help me.
Anyone who paid that much for a folding phone and DIDN&#39;T expect the screen to break deserves anything that comes their way
Was that screen protector the touch overlay to connect both screens? Yeah that design was bad, it&#39;s just two phones stuck with an overlay 😂

You should see how well the iPhone 5 performs today versus when it first came out.
HAHHAHA.. SONY WILL NEVER DO THIS..<br><br>THAT&#39;S WHY I ALWAYS USE JAPANESE PREMIUM BRAND..<br>THEIR PRODUCTS DESIGN IS RIPE AND COMPLETELY WORK WELL.. VERY RARE OCCASIONS OF FAILURE.. AND THEY DON&#39;T HAVE BIG MOUTH AS SAMDUNG<br><br>PLASTIC SCREEN?? WHAT A JOKE

Aside from the physical flaws, it&#39;s Samsung&#39;s bastardized version of Android packed with half assed imitations of Google apps that nobody asked for, nobody wants and nobody can uninstall.
Love your YouTube videos,  big fan of all your videos.  thank you. After watching this video,  I found the Galaxy fold phone on Amazon. It is still for sale, I thought it was canceled. Can you tell me what&#39;s the story is. I don&#39;t understand. Is it canceled or not, that is my question? Type this in and it&#39;ll pop right up on Amazon. Samsung - Galaxy Fold SM-F900U - Cosmos Black - Unlocked AT&amp;T Model GSM (US Warranty).  Thank you 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

U can see the fold line When its open...

2k I provably pay $100 for it! Phone companies are ridiculous
Also Samsung... stop trying to make Bixby a thing.
If the &quot;top layer&quot; of your screen is a fucking screen protector... sorry... there&#39;s something wrong with it.
I think Kyocera Echo was more reliable! You should get that one! Lol
Apple is way better sumgsung been having trouble since there 8 or 9 come out that sucks I am staying with Apple I never been having trouble with my Apple phone I love it
$2000 flipping turd, go buy 20 Wal-Mart Samsung galaxy express $100 phone. More phones for your dollars.

Fragile phones are not the best choice for me!
can you give it to me sir  ahahha<br><br>nice vid
You&#39;ve had it for 3 wks and only used it for 3 or 4 days and now it has to go back.  Sad.  You must have already taken your sim card out for whatever you have been using.     I would have used it for 3 wks. if I liked it.   Thank you for sharing your thoughts and info on this product.
Use the iPhone 4s
which smartphone is the best
Where can i buy your hoodie man, looks really good

The bixby button has got to go.    Or at least disable it entirely so that even long presses do nothing.  Though the new razr excites me more.
SAMSUNG Galaxy Note 9 with the yellow spen still the best...
Mistake #1 was spending $2000 on a phone

Use the razer phone 2, I’ve been thinking about switching to that from my iPhone 6s+ but I’m not sure how it would hold up in daily use

choose the OPPO find x
That’s why apple is better
Where do you get your background music? It&#39;s great with Dolby Atmos and Eizo Rewire Pro.
The major issue is any random person who doesn&#39;t keep their hands to themselves might even try peeling the display.

The new king is Huawei.. idc about security reasons that they throw about it..
Bought Huawei P20 Pro last year and it is the best thing I got ever. Am Satisfied with every single function it is delivering
The only people who will still get a Galaxy Fold are those who have already ordered the $2,000 device and who tell Samsung specifically that they still want to receive it. “If we do not hear from you and we have not shipped by May 31st, your order will be canceled automatically,” Samsung told all Galaxy Fold pre-order customers by email this week.
Go back to one plus, its the best there is, period.
I&#39;m not ready. Could try a scroll out screen somehow
Honestly, Huawei had a better looking foldable phone than Samsung. The fold seems to go against almost everything Samsung itself has been selling to us like very thin devices, the Fold when it&#39;s folded is very thick, and bezel-less displays, the external display looks awkward nowadays.
Use a Nokia 3310
Beethoven  Moonlight
Stop whining girls, they did something no one else did. You have done quality control for them, they will fix this shit and make a better one :). When they solve these issues, this device is going to the best phone Samsung did since S2.
Just s10 plus
Great video, thanks for taking the time to make it. Galaxy Note 9 is still my favourite.
pls try the huawei mate x!!!!
They have rush the fold phone to quick with to meny mistakes
I&#39;d say an honor phone so maybe honor play or something

You should use the real foldabke ohones with a real keyboard

Well, if Apple will release a foldable Phone they will make sure that it works

You should do the Galaxy s10 5g
2024: sold my used samsung phone, bough used bentley instead.
Switch back to note 9
okay but like they&#39;ve just made flip phones again but this time they&#39;re even less functional
Oneplus 7
I remember  having a Palm Treo, and I think the palm generation before the Treo, and people would have the same response. They would ask me why would you want that, it is so big? Everyone wants a smaller phone and you now have a monster. They would proudly pull out their flip phone and tell me I was wasting my money.  And when I bought my first IPad some thought it was cool and others said the screen was too small compared to a laptop and it was too heavy to replace an iPhone.  And to a certain degree, they were right. But they couldn&#39;t envision all the apps that would be created that would almost make the iPad a replacement for a laptop.  I am a go go gadget girl and I will probably purchase the fold when it comes out for consumers.  If consumers buy into it, I think we will see apps create user interfaces that work well on this size platform. And if enough of them do, other third party software companies will create apps that today we can&#39;t  even imagine  that will help define the use and purpose of the Galaxy Fold.  Its always a risk investing in the newest technology. I mean, my parents purchased a Sony Betamax instead of a VCR when I was a kid. 🤦‍♀️
The luxury business phone from last video
Kudos for Samsung for innovating, but at that price &amp; at that level of fragile ness.. I think people will be more than happy with their regular phones. To cough up over $2k on a device that can easily get damaged by a slight bump, nah.
If i get it i will use it. Because i like it very much
Why have a foldable phone? Honestly.<br>We had flip phones ages ago<br>Did we find something better? Yes<br>Did we still want the flip phones? No<br><br>It’s only unique because it’s a foldable touchscreen <br>And I don’t believe it will aber be a real hype because if you want something <br>Larger than a phone you get a tablet. You can get a good phone AND tablet for LESS money than that foldable Samsung

Oneplus 6t McLaren!!!!
&quot;Fragile&quot; so i feel like a device with such new ingenuity probably now should have had more cushion-time for practical users or critical users. It would of done a lot better in that aspect of it slowly implemented across different markets and not the average consumer market. I would of suggested this to private businesses or organizations who wouldnt produce high demand but you can learn about possible threats to the device and handling over time in a manageable pace.

No brainier, LG - Exalt VN220. This is the best flip phone on the market right now. :)
this is why im staying with iPhone 🥵💀
What happens if you keep it
Every company makes mistake
Use a BlackBerry Key2 or New Palm
You should put your sim card in the newest Google pixel

Apple will never make a foldable phone. However Samsung will make a junk broken foldable phone.
where&#39;s the cc man?
Funny how you don&#39;t hate on Samsung but anytime you get a chance to poop on Apple for the smallest thing, you most certainly do.  Your angle is very obvious fanboy.
How about the new razor that&#39;s coming
Huawei p30 pro of course
Anyone hyped for Oneplus 7 ??
什么时候评测下魅族16s
Lol this is just proof of how dumb some people are. The real reason Samsung is forced to recall their phone is because dumbasses were pulling the screen off, thinking it was a protector. The only thing Samsung is gonna change is a note in the instructions saying &quot;hey dont pull off the screen&quot;<br>Its dumbasses like that why we need warnings for everything -_-
I phone 11
galaxy a80
I think that the Huawei mate x is better than the fold
But TG still sticking with this device.
Try the iPhone 11
Great review man, VERY new sub, but you hit exactly how I felt. Lux phone, it&#39;s awesome that Samsung is pushing the envelope, but working in a paper mill, it&#39;s just not for me🤷‍♂️ That can&#39;t ever me justify me hating on the device! You keep doing you and I hope that ALL companies keep doing them. Bread bakers to phone makers, be passionate people, and I think the good people appreciate you!
Lol this phone is terrible... design wise
Hello fan from moracco<br>I relly was thinking why you dont try the infinx compeny it has a great mideum phones for relly relly good price i highly recemand to try one of does
Moto Z3, it&#39;s old but I never saw you do a video on it
I&#39;ve had every galaxy phone, and I always have otter boxes on them, ever since they added that dumb ass Bixby button I always cut the Bixby button off flush with a knife so I&#39;m not hitting it constantly instead of volume down. I have never used Bixby.
Switch to the new ifold iPhone 11. It’s coming out or has came out..
Samsung to smart. <br>They know everybody&#39;s going to take it and open it and see what&#39;s inside of it so the first  they did it was the bad one so everybody can copy the bad system.
anything from motorola
You can try Honor 8X that I&#39;m using. If you curious about it.
I swear this man fucking cries in the thumbnails so much I’m surprised he isn’t 20% water

just switch back to huawei p30 pro
go to the minimalistic Light phone
U should choose Mate X
I&#39;m done with Samsung as a company. I&#39;ve been Bixby-ed to death...
You hate every phone...
I love samsung but I think this phone is only for trash the money, if you want one phone like this, Buy a Tablet LOL, or one phone and one tablet
I have ocd and that crease in the middle will bother me to death.
I don’t really think foldable phones will ever become a popular thing. Like what’s the point...
Huawei Mate X
Can you try out a Camon, or something from Tecno? Technically, Tecno is Chinese, but you see a lot of Camons in Africa. It would be interesting to see a First-World perspective of a Third-World phone.
It was a good try though

Samsung should pay us $2000 to put up with Bixby

I hope Samsung fixes the issues that this phone has. In addition, I also hope that they create a stylus for it that&#39;s just as good as the Apple Pencil. I feel that this phone has the potential to be amazing if it gets its own well-made stylus. Without a stylus, its just a convertible smartphone, which isn&#39;t really that useful. However, if it had a good stylus like the Apple Pencil, it would provide the benefits of both a phone and a tablet, which would make it much more valuable. I wouldn&#39;t care much about a foldable smartphone to pay such a high price tag, but I can justify it if the phone has a good stylus, because this would make the phone much more useful. I think Samsung should really consider making a good stylus a standard part of this new foldable smartphone technology.
Is it practical to use an apple iPad mini as your daily driver phone????
now you need huawei mate X next
Nice to handle,👍<br>Nice to hold,🤩<br>If you fold it, 📚 <br>Consider it sold 😱<br>This is failed project by Samsung.<br>Even if it succeeds, at $2,000 most people would prefer say a Note 🔟 and $1,000 Smart OLED TV 📺
I wish you would speak a little more softly! :) Nice video
Folding phones were called Flip phones back in my day. Cars don’t even come with a spare wheel anymore, not even a donut. Only a Fix-a-flat. So you see folks, sometimes old stuff is good in a way but you’ve got to know how best to implement it. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Its garbish and another PR diaster! If happened to Apple you and others wouldnt be so kind
<b>STOP BUYING EXPENSIVE PHONES!</b><br><br><b>New phones don’t cost more to build than their last ones! They will continue to go up in price until they see people starting to push back!</b>
But you can buy a tablet and take it with you, and it will cost you less, having all the features + no squeezed middle line. To me this product has no value as it is now. I can only review it for money, not spend my own. Only thing this device serves now is to test if 2k $ telephone has some market share.
<b>I hope to God these phones are shelved and never coming back...</b><br><br><b>The last thing I want to see are tons of people holding up phones the size of tablets to take photos at concerts...</b> <br><br><b>People will start smacking them out of people’s hands.</b>
Get Huawei Foldable phone that one is more reliable
But samsung is better than Apple.. 😂
a crap Phone from a crap Company and shitty silly dev&#39;s.
Xperia 1 if you like ..
People are idiots. There is a protective film over the screen you remove when you take the device out of the box. The other protective layer that’s on the screen after you do that is obviously a part of the design and not meant to be removed. God ffs.
Ok
Considering the price tag, it&#39;s definitely a luxury device and not kinda.
I propose you switch to the other end of the smartphone spectrum, the SONIM XP8.
NOKIA 6620. You better do it <br>It is the opposite of the samsung fold and far superior in allways
3x more Galaxy fold  were gave in Europe and there Was no problem in Europe
Try the Samsung Galaxy S10E and compare it to the S10 :)
Why so soft for Samsung while u bid adieu....
This was a test run for samsung.

That phone is garbage.
This is only Samsung&#39;s second flop though so....
I’m an iPhone user but bring the S pen to this and widen the folded version of this and I’m on board. I say S pen because anytime I ever did switch to Android it was always a Samsung Note
Ive broken every phone I&#39;ve had even this one im on has a   sapphire screen make a decent phone that just won&#39;t break thats all i want small screen like the iPhone 4and fucking indestructible
I like Samsung, but I was worried about this device being a disaster. They can&#39;t really afford another oopsie after their exploding phones. Hopefully they get it right. It&#39;s good they&#39;re listening and reconsidering some design issues.
Go with a payphone with a bifold door. :-P
Xperia 1 next :)
Foldable phones should be to put the sizes by half, not by the double..
Samsumg s10
it&#39;s great and all but like somebody  Down below said  that we having the folded phone back it&#39;s only 10% cent of new things that is remade for the younger generation that&#39;s all
couldn&#39;t they just have two displays side by side when unfolded and not have one continuous panel? no discredit to the manufacturers making the folding phones like the Galaxy Fold and others, but honestly, if it is going to be like this (Foldables) then it wold make sense to have two displays with extremely thin bezels at the current state of technology vs one massive panel that folds over itself.
The Huawei Mate X
OnePlus 7pro?
I haven&#39;t seen your videos in a while, YOU LOOK GREAT MAN!!! Awesome work !
Samsung has really gone downhill. My S5 is still alive, but my S7 Edge bit the dust with one small drop. I now have an LG G6 plus that has survived numerous worse drops and works flawlessly.  Also, my Galaxy tab&#39;s motherboard fried in about six months. Samsung is not what it used to be. I will stay away.
switch to S10
use 3310
man that is an ugly phone. when you have it closed you carry a bulky double phone item in your pocket. The Fold looks like two S10&#39;s welded together, very shoddy.
I just need a good phone, not THIS.
It’s a piece of shit.

Please review galaxy tab s5e..
I would love to try out a couple games on the big screen. One of the downfalls imo is the side screen, which looks incredibly small. Hope they make it bigger.
i will be surprised if we see the galaxy fold come to market. as a premium product and price tag it will have to not just be cool but premium build and quality as well. i don&#39;t see how that can be achieved with the current setup and materials involved. with the continued use of opening and folding of the screen. it will inevitably wear and deteriorate. maybe a fold-able phone could work but not a fold-able screen.

At least the flip phones of the early 2000s and late nineties didn’t have screen issues and were straight forward. the Fold is a cool concept but I wouldn’t waste 2000 dollars on it.

Your a business guy, go with the Samsung note9.
Well stick your sim into a Nokia communicator. “The first folding phone” 😒
I miss the galaxy active phones 😭
It&#39;s just a screen problem it would be fixed soon
they know this will gonna happen.....
MI9 Transparent
Try an iPhone XS clone from China for a week. I wanna see how usable they are
I stopped buying Samsung shit since I discovered Xiaomi, half the price for slight better performances.
WOW This is not the future!!!<br><br>Honestly the screen is too big for a phone and too small for a tablet<br>If you want a &quot;bigger&quot; screen,u should go for a tablet but no a so called &quot;phone&quot;<br>but if you want a phone ,it is definitely not a best option

🤢 ah iPhone 📵 children OS, Android it&#39;s following him and so poor, 👀 and Windows OS is doing 20% some apps like them😭, i hope SONY get out of the box and make a software for phones📱. 😢
what i want to see is an iphone 5c with iphone x hardware. mm yea small screen, small form factor, fast hardware. f*** all these big phones, reaching all over these massive screens strains my tendons. i need a smaller phone that has fast technology. my eyes are good, i dont need a 32&quot;tv to read. i want SMALLER SMARTPHONES.
It&#39;s time for Huawei Mate X
What a terrible idea in my opinion.

Wow 😯 . This dude is actually saying something bad about a Samsung device??! The end is near..
Iphone xsmax please 💞💞
I&#39;m still in love with the idea of this phone, just really hope they can find solutions to all of these flaws, and they seriously have to adress the price point, $2k is just rediculously unreasonable...I&#39;m a galaxy fan, but they have most definitely have to do better...I&#39;m sure plenty of your loyal supporters would be more than happy to say they own this, but Samsung, please fix this mess you made...From a true fan, I know you can do better than this!
Its a folding phone thats probaly never been done before so obviously theres problems
Nokia 2600
Bro try some midrange phone...try the mi 9...
Cant wait for these to be 500$

I need help which one you guys think is the best. Huawei P30 lite or Samsung A50?
Do a new Sony phone. Never get to hear what&#39;s so great about them
they have given it to reviewers just to see if the phone will pass the test, but its cool phone, lets see what samsung will do.
Try a mobile in sony
what is so fresh about it? its that same o same o.
Huawei mate x is more interesting than tha
I LOVE Huawei phones. The recent unpleasantness between the US and China has limited my options. I believe an Honor 8x Max will work in the states and for sub $300, it has good specs including a 7.1&quot; display and a massive battery. Thoughts?
Best new features are: compatibility, headphone jack and real battery life!
One plus 7
Switch to the A80
Hi-Bye. I think it will come back, 10years from now. <br>It was not ready for the public, let’s be clear that.
Every time I see Samsung foldable phone...I want to put a piece of prosciutto and provolone cheese in the middle, grill it and eat it. That’s all I got.
it fold forward<br>it fold back<br>but most importantly<br>they cant make a case for that
First Folding Phone~~
Lol
Dang I’m legit just learning about this its real cool tho I’d get one whenit comes out if I had money lol
BACKPEDDALING AFTER PEDDALING...Hmmmm
A phone is a phone in the end...I have an Apple iPhone XR and it’s great. Samsung and apple are basically always going to have this stupid competition it’s just personal preference lol.
Xiaomi foldable
Mate 20 pro or Galaxy s10+
Nokia 8310
All phones have problems in the beginning. Remember when the iPhone 6 came out and it would legit overheat and explode or it would bend so easily same as the iPhone 8. Also The iPhone x is having problem with its charging.
The Samsung note 10 in 2020
Apple must be so happy
There&#39;s litterally no reason to half a phone that folds 😂 wtf. Especially with the price. It ain&#39;t a fucking laptop.
At least your honest
You should use the Razer 2
G zone rock
go back to the flip phone, the og foldable phone
The food is a all glass version of a DS.<br><br>Change my mind.
How about reviewing a phone that is the fastest operator for normal everyday use.  Google search, maps, and general productive work?  Cameras, animations, funny colors and other crap do not matter.  Just my opinion.
U 12 +
I&#39;m definitely not ready for a phone like this. For one thing, I am clumsy. I rely on using a case that cushions my phone when I drop it. I&#39;ve never smashed a phone, or cracked a screen, but that&#39;s because I choose cases that protect my phone from impact when I drop it. Something so fragile and difficult to protect would not suit me at all.
Samsung Origami Phone. America Folds . It is not a bluff...All in.
Who else noticed Moonlight Sonata in the background at the first part?
iPhone XR just a good cheap-er mainstream phone
I love my galaxy!! <br><br>S4.... but hey it keeps me happy
go to a Samsung s 10 plus
i like how everyone is crying about that crap.  I mean, WHY TF WOULD YOU BUY A PHONE LIKE THIS? There is not one extra feature, and you could have known before that it will break...
Waiting for the galaxy fold version 12.
is it any good to play games on it, when you use big screen to play games? if not why word you pay $2000 for a phone you can&#39;t  use big screen to play games on it. i use $2000 to buy a gaming laptop then.
I REALLY like the way it looks.  I cant wait for this to catch on.  cant wait for a foldable iPhone.
The Sony Experia Play is what your next phone should be
We never needed it, I never wanted it, Samsung can keep it.
MateX.....
Can you remove the screen protector ???????,😂😂😂😂<br>Don&#39;t remove that extra layer because taht is what makes it foldable . Also dont put a screen protector or anything else because it will damage your screen<br>Also the foldable is note 7&#39;s son......
If this device was Appel.. Would you speak gently about it!!!!!!!!
They’re gonna tise again!!!
This is why I always wait Haha but wait you only giving it a negative review because they asking for phone back what a loser period fake review
did you check the Lenovo Z6 pro? told to be flagship killer. Please make a review on that.
Switch to upcoming one plus 7
No, the hottest phone is the Sony Xperia 1. Everyone that has a YouTube channel should have a serious look on the Sony Xperia 1 (XZ4) due to the great video editing possibilities and the super great camera!
At least You&#39;re allowed to get on a united/delta flight with the Galaxy Fold. And that&#39;s not something very naturally with Samsung devices
Great 👍
Huawei mate X please...
I’ve been lucky to use both the Mate X and Galaxy Fold. I felt that Galaxy Fold was more fantastic. Infolding is easier to carry and more stable. In particular, Samsung fold user interface was amazing; despite the controversy over durability.
How about iphone SE :)
Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro. I don&#39;t necessarily care if it is this one in particular, I just want to see you use an ultra low budget phone ($200 range). It would be an interesting experiment going from something so expensive to something very much the opposite. I want to know if there is a legit reason we spend so much on these little pocket rectangles. The Redmi Note 6 Pro is available on amazon if you are interested.
LG V20
iPhone X
i sill luv samsung
Flip Phones are coming back. Also, $2000 worth of Disappointment 🤦‍♂️
It’s too much of a novelty right now. There’s no way to mass produce this and have it grip the market like the phones that are already out. It doesn’t make sense to me.

I kinda knew that there would be a problem with this phone.
In all honesty i would rather have a practical phone over a first gen luxury phone with moving parts. One day i want to get a folding phone but now is not the time.
How can a company like Samsung not foresee this catastrophe as a possibility and act accordingly before the release?
I have an off topic of the video question. How does he have split on his Netflix??
This phone is so lameeee lol idk why people even like it specially for 2gs? People that bought this are trippinnn
If only the next innovation was battery life. <br>God i&#39;d like to have a phone that i shouldn&#39;t have to charge constantly, and i do not even use my phone that much.
huawei p30 pro
It could be very interesting if you switched to the Nokia 1100 😎
Should never have been released if it&#39;s not been perfected. PR disaster.
It would be cool if you could press a button and it could open up
Galaxy fold is trash... huawei&#39;s phone is much better the folding there is much smarter and its look much better than the fold
Thank you for your honesty.
Use galaxy 10
Oh please.... as much as I appreciate your reviews... if Apple had done this and failed so catastrophically, would you honestly be so placating and obsequious ? Isn’t this EXACTLY the fucking reason why a company would be conservative in  its’ releases ... or does that not factor in?
I think the real horror their is when you reach the warranty period and the phone is showing some  unusual hardware failure like dying motherboard I guess you know what I mean 😆
Why not P30 Pro?
I love how he has the most OG games on his phone. Geometry dash and BTD 5
Motorola
you are the keemstar of tech bro
Drop it on the ground
Matex Huawei
To me, the display on the front is kinda dumb. I&#39;d even prefer something smaller even to just show the time/notifications instead of having a terrible experience using a screen / never using its potential (Waste of battery)
That phone is a wast of money.
Switch to the huawei p30 pro!!!!!!!!
how much would the fold cost if apple made it
Samsung Galaxy Note 10
It&#39;s just ugly..

I dont think that we need to fold a phone<br>..
The most hard device to find a phone case
didn&#39;t they test it? lol
Fucking Handys,.... They make you stupid
You should switch to a Galaxy J1 or a Motorola moto E
I’m waiting for this guy to come to the realization that he will never find happiness in a device.
but i dont remember that we had said hi !
Anyone love s9+ 📱
Try 2 cups and a string.
Just because the American reviewers. Only American reviewers got problems with Fold...<br><br>From the beginning of the announcement, I was excited about the Fold and I&#39;m still exciting.<br><br>We have to criticize if we want to make progress in technology but people don&#39;t need to be extremely hard in critics with a new technology like &quot;we are not your beta tester..!&quot; (Not u) <br><br>The first product from a new tech will always let us feel as a beta tester because this is the first gen and all 1st gen from a new technology have problems... ✌️✌️✌️
I would keep it and say it was stolen...
Flex phone will be pain in the ass forevah!
Samsung when screen goes out  - &quot;There&#39;s something wrong with our phone, we need you to send them back to be fixed.&quot;<br>Apple when phone blows up - &quot;That&#39;s your problem, you must have been holding it wrong.&quot;
samsung is just crap since the battery exploded. don&#39;t even want one gifted. would insta sell it. gimme lg, huawei or sony
F this piece of shit.. should 900 bucks...

People can say what they want, but I&#39;m glad samsung is always pushing the boundaries and trying to push the envelope too. Yeah this one may not be completely reliable right now, but we don&#39;t see apple doing shit like this. To each their own, but, I&#39;m excited to see what else samsung does. Can&#39;t wait to see their improvements. Can&#39;t wait to see next gen. Or even 2 gens  from now.
If Samsung microwave lasts for a few months, what do you expect from a phone?
I’m happy that they didn’t start selling it
Stupidest phone I&#39;ve ever seen
How much is the galaxy fold?
&quot;The hottest thing to happen to tech in a very long time&quot;<br><br>God that&#39;s sad.. some dude super excited about a 1st gen folding brick with creases. We&#39;re being fed drips, the technology behind this monstrosity is decades old.
Bend test that shit then send it back
Sorry I’m sticking with my XR

Cool. <br><br><br>Apple would have just deemed it as a user error, and given everyone the middle finger.

I use hardline phone instead of folding phone 🤪
cant blame any manufacturer for putting out anything thats 1st gen that failed. the fact that it didnt start selling it to consumer and then made a massive recall is good.  1st gen tech is always met with a high percentage of not meeting standards or fail, but thats how tech gets to develop to be better. so good on yah samsung. cant wait for the future.

I&#39;m still rockin my s5 active. Never had such a durable phone. Samsung realized this when they released later phones. No removable battery or back plate.
At least they really care their customers and doesn&#39;t rush
People who bought this didn&#39;t know that they were stupid
The Koreans are not as smart as the Japanese or the Chinese!
Sucked in Samsung! I&#39;m a note 9 user but fuck em and their fucked up ego thinking they can do that without issues. Koreans are no where near as intelligent as the Japanese or the Chinese!!!!

Looking for a new phone. Switching from iPhone 6. Is the Galaxy A70 really the best choice under 400€/$?
كسم الاعلان اللي بيجي في الاول
Every single other smartphone has those temporary removable plastic screen protector things... <br><br>So its extremely stupid of Samsung to put those plastic screen protectors on their phone, that if removed, will break the phone, because lets be completely honest... instinctively, people are going to want to remove that plastic off their brand new phone, like they would do to every other phone. <br><br>There were so much reviews of the $2000 phone, where majority of the reviewers instinctively removed the plastic screen thing, and the phone broke or glitched out. So, it WILL happen to people that end up buying the phone and havent watched any reviews on it.

The never ending race of this profit oriented world. Take this as a warning!  The insanity of this “war” for the first place will have the consequences. And such big mistakes :)) i’m sorry but this is a big waste of time, energy on useless shit that does not heal this dying world.
I like that ur doing that at 50 min past midnight
The irony is calling anything a &#39;phone&#39; these days. Nobody ever makes calls on them.
Why not try the Mate X. Huawei&#39;s folding phone. Just for comparison. Infold vs Outfold. Would be very interesting....
Galaxy 10 should be the phone of choice... or if you want something unique, Ubuntu phone
I suggest the new LG G8 I works life your perspective on it since I have the LG G7.
The solution is to paint it with gold and put some diamonds on it<br>To merit it&#39;s price

Where&#39;s the p30 pro review?
So many haters though..as if all were going to buy in the first place..half the commenters here can&#39;t even buy a good flagship from apple,samsung,google etc..and they are dissing the fold..let the tech mature..who says just go buy and not as if they started shipping and then you noticed the flaws..like the battery debacle of the note..these same arguments were made when galaxy note was launched..now look where the industry went..
It&#39;s a piece of shit... luxury what&#39;s luxury about plastic 🤔 &amp; yess am a galaxy s10... always had sammies.

If someone drops it it’s toast!

ok you have a big crush on galaxy fold, but its a diff story if you actualy buy it<br>then it breaks,then the crowd you tried to please doesnt realy care.
My thoughts: <br><br> For about the same price you could get the best iPhone and iPad or the best Samsung phone and tablet.. Each is much better quality from what I’ve seen.. I just don’t see the point yet it seems like a novelty and not really practical..
Why the fuck would you even buy this 2k phone far more isefull stuff out there
probably a full size phone with a screen that bends around the back which can pop out, like the slap on wrist bands would be more ideal.
Folding phones are just a gimmick who needs one?

Why put too much efforts on foldable and not make a good simple reliable phone.
Galaxy fold is a really great smartphone it should not get wasted
With a price tag like that this phone better be plated in gold or give head or something.
Huawei will do it right
