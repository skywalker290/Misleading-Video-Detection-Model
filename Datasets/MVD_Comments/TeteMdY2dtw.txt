Pewdiepie hate Connor also pewdiepie<br>Dont die connor
Connor is the water sheep of Terraria
“I did a lil bit of my mining off camera”
this is between the events of episode 2 and 3 btw
Engineer founded, ok then he found goblin tinkeler... Ok... THEN HE FOUND DRUNKEN MAN
The Logan Paul title of the video 💀
everytime felix dies<br>felix: CONNOR DON&#39;T TALK TO ME!<br>connor: 😐
Is it just me or does the space gun sound like the doodle jump guy shooting
Pewdiepie invented a time machine off camera
this feels like a 2012 video
Here I am killing Skeletron with a bow and hellfire arrows <br>Pewds uses friggin laser guns 😂
You play Terraria<br>You hit rock bottom <br>Welcome Pewds
Can&#39;t sleep in hell ? <br>Connor .... I hate you 😂😂😂😂
Wait what happened to the tower
Jumpscare at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1214">20:14</a>
soo good game
Michael scott vs Toby &lt; Pewdiepie vs Connor
He probably knows that throwing the voodo doll into lava summons a boss...
The dungeon skeleton realul sau &quot; kiss me on my hot mouth &quot;
Hey are you playing in another world?
every comment is 3 years old :/
Wait what I thought he had a space gun?
I think accidentally magic mirroring home when you super far away on a large map was more infuriating then anything in terraria including golem and that things a nightmare
is true minecraft is copying alot of bit in terraria
I lost 1001132 Bain call
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=294">4:54</a> <br>I&#39;m ga-

Imagine your name is Connor and u watch this video
I got confused... Why has he more progress in part 3 ?
<b>deja vu</b>
me: sees the tally counter on the floor<br>pewdiepie: alright ill go back home<br>me: NOOOOOOO
He trying the killua strat without the electricity and the plot armor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1214">20:14</a> .....
Agradezco mucho que los sponsors los haya puesto al final del vídeo<br>Es algo tedioso que estén al inicio &lt;3
why is this part 4 but has stuff that obviously happened before part 2?
People ask me why I don&#39;t like minecraft. It&#39;s cuz it&#39;s mid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=780">13:00</a> hurt me, Ive been trying to find one for ages
bruh i was just eating then poodle appeared!!! BRUH!!!!!
Ummm is the series number is changed cause i saw 2 but felling like this should be 2??
Does he have different worlds?
I can watch 500 episodes of pewdiepie playing terraria
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1324">22:04</a> Literally the most &#39;pew pew die&#39; thing he has done in a while.
Pewds: gets murmasa on first try and doesn’t know he can make nights edge <br>Me: cant find a murmasa in the entire dungeon
Pewdiepie played all day last episode and I dont think he has stopped yet😂 poor Marzia
I find it hilarious how the Tavernkeep and the Goblin Tinkerer both spawned in the dungeon along with the Mechanic. Never had that happen to me before.
me when he crafts specter boots:<br>his first steps to terraspark boots
Noice
Felix : <b>dies</b><br><br><br><br>Felix to connor : &quot;peace was never an option&quot;
i like watching you progress in the game your doing good!
i played terraria 2 player for the first time that i even played at all and now im starting to see hoiw much easier is is to be solo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1214">20:14</a> <b>W A T E R</b> S H E E P
The sudden image of Watersheep after he said water candle made me chuckle so hard
crazy how easy softcore is, dont need to even dodge skeletron :D
love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1542">25:42</a>
&#39;Screw you Connor, I hope you go to hell&#39;<br><br><b>And that kids is foreshadowing at its finest</b>
<b>Puts feral claws instead of the ones that let you actually climb</b>
&quot;this better not be another minecraft referance&quot;<br>bro half of the shit in minecraft is from terraria
Good memories
Watched 2 times
Poor Connor, everytime Pewds dies and comes back home, he&#39;s just gotta hear the man bully him. XDD
i come from the year 2022

Thanks felix you made me happy.and my freaking dinner just got spilled!thanks for making me full
why is episode 4 before episode 3 in timeline?
In what order should people watch this series
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=660">11:00</a> 🫠 it&#39;s your fault Conor
Pewdiepie is awesome and cool about everything and funny, can you please make more videos about terraria please?
Where did all the equipment come from
water candle water sheep
nevermind
this should&#39;ve bbeen the 3 or 2 ep
ep 3 and 4 should be switched
The game that he is talking about at the end is the most cursed thing I have ever seen
this video gives me old pewdiepie vibes and im lovin it
Lucky he got 3 npc in 1 dungeon
Hay thật sự, cảm ơn Đức Phúc mang cho mình dòng cảm xúc này!
Pewds: I’m gonna kill Conner<br>Voodoo doll: no u
Bruh he just found every secret npc in the dungeon
U are so funny
Anyone watching in 2022 😹

Why is this part 4 ?
He is already at episode 4 and beat skeleton, but yet I can’t beat queen bee because I’m quite scared of losing.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=710">11:50</a> nah dont feel like it
Also what happend  with his House and hearts
WHY DID YOU FORGET THE FACECAM ITS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!
101 on how to watch Felix ASMR
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=859">14:19</a> I feel attacked
Me: grinds for an hour to get demon scythe.                                    Pewds: get it on accident yes
For people confused, the first part is continued from ep 1 but after that it continues from the last ep
me feeling violated since my name is connor 😐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1003">16:43</a>)))
Instantly I realise that he is in the wrong world or has reverted to a previous save... his house had more in it in the previous episode. And that on top of forgetting face came XD
im confused
DONT FROW THE DOMMY IT WILL SPAWN A BOSS
Spent the entire video waiting for someone in chat to tell him to throw connor into the lava
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=424">7:04</a> This is where episode 4 starts if you guys are confused
wtf, i swear he has already made more pogress in episode three
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1085">18:05</a> Felix zombie sound
connor is the best part in this game
Petition to bring back brofist
If your confused watch from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=424">7:04</a> he made the start that to make it 30 minutes
PewDiePie is the best and funny and he have skills of building houses
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=455">7:35</a> Americans be like:
Rage and yelling swering comit suicide this video is insane
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1324">22:04</a>
The first 7 minuits is just an reveiw from the first part
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=734">12:14</a> my ptsd kicked in
hes playing in bitch difficulty
Where is cactus chair
I feel like he would shit himself if he saw the moon lord
Zombie kill pewds, conner it’s all your fault
&quot;don&#39;t go, don&#39;t go! i love you!&quot; that will make them go faster lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=425">7:05</a> lol
how did he find three npcs in one place
NO WAY!!! He just simply finds 3 NPC&#39;s in the dungeon. On my first completed World the goblin army took the longest I&#39;ve ever heard it taking as well as finding the goblin NPC. Pretty much had everything done that I could do without those😭
why is ikea tower different
Why is he playing as if it&#39;s been years since last episode? This was uploaded 9 days later.
this is  out of order
This dude speaks tons of bad words
“Do you think ugly people realize” <br><br>Me: obviously not. 😂
Just skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=424">7:04</a> if you don&#39;t want the recap.
He forgor
Omg god this dude is soo lucky with the items 👨
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=527">8:47</a><br>With great power comes great responsibility
PART 2 IS PART 4!!AND PART 4 IS PART 2!!!
The best flashback episode.
Apparently this is my first ever liked video congrats!
Me when I’m trying to fall asleep: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=553">9:13</a>
Я единственный русский кто смотрит это?
dang...”think he had a bad day.”
I was really about to just deal with the fact that I watched the episodes in wrong order until I came to the comments section. Thanks guys.
lucky found the tavernkeep mechanic and goblin
It&#39;s so weird without a face cam bruh, and also why he always screw up his episodes
I wanna play terraria again i havent played it for 5 days now
lol my guide in my new terraria world names connor 😀😀
So today we&#39;re going to hell.<br><br>-PewDiePie
CMON CONNOR &gt;:(
Pewds: I will murder you whole family, Connor.<br>Litterly his whole family: Moon Lord, Ninja Master and Wall Of Flesh (ofc him self)
Pewdiepie is a goblin slayer
A PREQUEL EPISODES!!!
Is that a picture of santa claus?<br>Literally the painting said CURSED MAN
You&#39;re lucky to get a demon scythe. It has a 2% drop rate.
B r u h
He has
What happened to all ur other hearts and ur meteor armor
Pewds said &quot;let&#39;s eat&quot; when he got home instead of &quot;I&#39;m home&quot;
&#39;What do i do with this voodo doll? Can i use it to hurt Connor?&#39;<br>hue hue boi
For everybody confused with the episode it skips back to where we left off at the 7 minute mark
Out of all the time playingamd watching terraria I&#39;ve never seen the goblin spawn in the dungeon<br>Edit: why is the tavernkeep in there too aggh
Felix: &quot;I love killing rich people.&quot; <br>Also Felix: <b>kills self</b>
And the op weapons
Pewd you really need the zenith
This is before episode 2. He introduced us to him having the big net in episode 2 XD
Its funny how he found out the zombies jump in the fourth episode
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=807">13:27</a> zombie VA
So basically the first part is before part 3 and after the time skip its back to real time
Makes minecraft looks so empty : Yea very true
Quote from pewdiepie: I love killing rich people
&quot;DON&#39;T TOUCH ME I&#39;M SWEDISH&quot;<br>-Pewdiepie
when i fought skeletron  i had iron stuff
Why am I commenting on a year old video
This dude is gonna get a slime staff you just watch.
He found three NPCs in the dungeon, what the fuck?
This feels like 2013 YouTube with videogame commentary without a facecam
This episode order is kinda screwed up
يا الهطف
Episode 1: &quot;you DIE if you&#39;re poor&quot;<br>Episode 4: &quot;I also LOVE killing rich people&quot;<br>aggressive socialism at its finest
felix go find umbrella so you wont die from fall damage
Not gonna lie his morning voice kinda cute though.
I am actully ofended by him dissing the waterbolt
Holy pwedepie I can&#39;t believe it subs omg
Why does he replay past footage or something in the beginning?
This guy is never gonna get too moonlord with all these goddamn breaks he takes
Dude. This was like episode 2 lol
Felix the meteorite armor lets you be in lava
good channle but why lock videos under a pay wall i have seen no other youtuber do this
&quot;I&#39;m gonna go to hell and throw conner in hell&quot;<br><br>Me: <i>softly</i> Dont
Sheesh
Why is the start like episode 2
When u open ur mums phone messages: 383978328088

I think this is supposed to be episode 2 bro
pewdiepie: don&#39;t go don&#39;t go i love you.<br><br>stazen:😳
&quot;Don&#39;t touch me I&#39;m Swedish&quot;
How was this a year ago
connor roasts intensify
Herkes is armoures where the weapon!?!?
Wait did he start a new world?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1829">30:29</a> I had extreme anxiety when he tried to throw that doll into lava
rich mahogany, poor mahogany, not rich but not poor mahogany
Connor be like:🥲
Surely he new it spawned a boss
Honestly he&#39;s so lucky, he found 2 hard-to-find npc in a single biome
He didn’t realize he was satin all along
I was laughing when he sold Copper shortsword
Well dryad just dominates goblin army she heals you really fast and attacks and she heals npcs so momento where you think your npcs are dead when you die to goblin army but dryad takes care of it all

I really wanna see him accidentally break plantera bulb when he gets to hardmode
I’m so confused on how I went from episode 3 and he had so much done compared to now wtf
The prologue for episode 3
I am sure that he has upgraded his game since this happened. I can&#39;t watch the streams because I am not a member.
Felix, &quot;I hate corruption.&quot; I feel you
U BOUGHT A TOOL BELT BUT NOT THE TINKERERS WORKSHOP AND U COBALT SHIELD FIRST so lucky yet so dumb
Can someone please explain how felix is this lucky

Dream luck, hmmm?
Pewdiepie: terraria has honey blocks now I think Minecraft copied terraria <br>Terraria players and Minecraft player’s:<br>Well yes but actually no
1 year
Pewds returning at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=424">7:04</a> completely changed his personality
lol was it an coincidence that he said &quot; don&#39;t go I love you &quot;

How is he so lucky, first enchanted sword second demon scythe then water bolt like what the frick. I watched later in then ALSO GOBLIN TINKERER

It hurt watching him miss the tally counter in the dungeon
Felix and Conner remind me of Michael Scott and Toby.
I was wondering when he was going to find queen bee
Terraria = (Connor/water sheep) X minecraft
imagine messing up the order
Pewdiepie finding rare NPCs just like too common for him
You die 😭<br><br>You are reincarnated into bunny 😅<br><br>Your in Terraria 😭
Who are you 🤔?
who else just enjoys rewatching these vids
The luck is mad
If you get bad grades, blame it on Connor, if you stub your toe, blame it on Connor, if you DIE, blame it ALL on Connor
wait your studio is in poland? i was born in poland!
yeee (⌐■_■)
Me a terraria veteran watches him me trigerd
the addiction is taking hold of him
Why is water sheep in the backround almost invisible
Water sheep
Anyone else noticing that he has found 2 of the things needed to craft the best sword in the game
“I’m not afraid to kill an old man!” Felix
Me breaks a fort block my inventory go fullllllllll
My name is Connor and every time he says he hates Connor I feel sad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=201">3:21</a>

He just found tavern keeper and goblin thinkerer on the dungeon in less than 5 minutes ._.
I like when he always goes to his house and say:&quot;Connor... I hate you&quot;.
Water candle water sheep
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1287">21:27</a> anakin at the jedi temple during order 66

31.13 wtf
The video: <b>looking like a continuation from episode 1</b><br><br>Me: <b>loading cat meme</b>
ok but wheres the rest and why is the house emptier than episode 2 and smaller than in episode 3 and where are his tools wtf
Way why he was better in 3# did he time traveled a game???
i&#39;m so confused<br>in episode 2, he starts with a bunch of nem stuff, and i was like<br>ok<br>but now, in episode four it&#39;s showing him getting that sutff<br><br>i was not expecting that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1055">17:35</a> Skeletron: Tis but a scratch
This series is so weird to watch cause my name is Conner

Pewd is high while posting the vids it&#39;s clearly this one is before the IKEA Hotel
did he just trash away the valor?
CONNOR!
This is 2nd part of the series lol
He’s evolving just backwards
The cursed skull does look like popcorn wtf
WHY IS HE GETTING SUCH GOOD REFORGES
Without webcam and a calm tone this reminds me of pewdiepie  10 years ago 🥰
Minecraft was made in middle 2009 and Terraria was made in early or late 2004.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1054">17:34</a> &quot;WOW, was that a Monty Python reference??&quot;
Pigybank = enderchest
I&#39;ve defeated wall of flesh 3 times
Wait.... are you say tadaimasu?
Well I was scared for him when he asked if Alfred could die 😬
I know pewdiepie it’s corners fault sh**
Don&#39;t abuse me :(

Peds called me sexy beast yay (on my dads account)
Sad u have to pay to watch the rest of the play through. Since when does YouTube make u pay to watch videos
Did ... did you just throw away a slime statue?
felix is big dumb, and no he hasn&#39;t done any sins that i&#39;m calling out now<br>it&#39;s just that he thinks he&#39;s good<br>he&#39;s playing normal mode
&quot;chillin&#39; by the fire&quot; - is that even possible?!
If that wraith statue was hooked to a pressure plate...
He sounds like 2012 pewds at the beginning of the video
my name is connor :(
&quot;I love killing rich peoples&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1340">22:20</a><br><br><b>French revolution intensifies</b>
Pewds: you can&#39;t stop me weather<br>Weather: let&#39;s see about that<br>AWAKEN MY MASTERS
Pewds <b>gets waterbolt</b> Also pewds: The waterbolt can suck my ass. Terraria veterans: ......
I’m laughing so hard. he thought he was on fire but it was the armors trail
“I feel bad stabbing an eye”<br><br>Proceeds to stab a dead human.
When he was in the dungeon did u see the mermaid shell?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=396">6:36</a> <br>Dat fucking scared me dude
One time there was a sex YouTuber called beauty pie he&#39;s still alive because god is one of his and he is also offend of the ugly t-series Dado neznatne uhvatiću is PewDiePie or ugly t-series but a couple years later God the side of you to be a fan of and it was PewDiePie and his floor gang a lot of people are friends of PewDiePie and his floor gang but more people I bet fans of floor gang
I.....got a Terraria advertisement while watching this...
I saved the angler from drowning easily
pewdiepie: why cant minecraft add more boss.. <br><br>mimrcraft: actually we can, but are we gonna?🤣🤣
Pewdiepie gangsta until he fight skeletron prime
PewDiePie: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1587">26:27</a><br>Me: Are you on drugs?
Connor: tries to give tips to peepee (name of pewds character)<br>Felix: I HATE YOU, CONNOR
I’m so confused last episode u had like the mediate armor now you have wood armor wait nvm
Isnt this part 3?
Who watches in 2020?
cactus chair
When he dropped the black lens 😢
How tf did he get tavern keep?
I’ve played this game for over 16 hours and he has better items than I do. Demon scythe? Already?
Idk why he hates Conner but loves  Alfred
I&#39;ve been watching pewdiepie&#39;s episodes of terraria, damn I&#39;m envious. I wish I can play it on phone, too bad you need to purchase it first.
You better tell me this content is good cuz t-series is literal dog poo
Shari=connor
Wait, your <br>house changed
BIG BRAIN LOLOLOLOLOLOL
PEWDIPIE U THINK CONNOR DIE IS GOOD NO BECAUSE IVE HE DIE YOU CANT NOT CRAFT LIKE ISAMPLE DA MOSE STRONGER WEAPON
lol he cut from having meteor armour to hellstone armour and he didn&#39;t even add that part in
The first 7 ish minutes is before last episode. Everything else is after.
When PewDiePie goes to throw Connor in Hell (doesn’t actually go to hell) not knowing that’s how you summon the final boss lol
There should’ve been an Obsidian Play button for 100M
Why are these streams out of order
Connors gonna end up being the water sheep of terraria
connor : <b>breaths</b><br>pewdipie: IM DONE WITH YOU
Take the hand gun u make better gun with it
Water bolt &gt; Space gun &gt;
Dude I found my tavern keeper in hell, I was protecting him, from hell bats, fire imps, demons<br><br><br>Then he died.... after that I could nvr find him
Terrarian: sees wall of flesh<br><br>Terrarian: <b>bee nades intensifys</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1214">20:14</a> <br>WATER SHEEEEPPPPP
Skeletron is so easy in normal mode, all you need is 1-4 campfires and waterbolt and the dungeon so the projectiles can bounce of  the walls
Im finding that mfing goblin for like 3 days and he found it after the mechanic girl goddangg
Where is conor?
Yes i do realise, pewds
Play expert mode
Pewdiepiiiiiiieeeee watch socksfor1 he has tareria vids HES REAL GOOD ATH ITH
I prefer calm tired pewdiepie
I started crying when he threw out the slime statue
Felix: old man don’t touch me <br>Me: should’ve used your no no square
pewdiepie your journey is almost done
wait what happened ..?  7 mins in and then all of a sudden he has a new house and all this stuff .???
i started it got a g fuel pewdiepie ad thought it was part of the video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=425">7:05</a> When the vid actually starts
I think U got ep4 mixed with ep3 as the title
why i am seeing water sheep
.
I just got a gfuel pewdiepie ad and I thought it was part of the video but no it was an actual ad.
Pewds: <b>tortures a sheep ultimately leading to his death</b><br>Also pewds: I feel bad stabbing an eye
God if he would just double jump before he hits the ground-
The game got no value and priceless confused
The reason why the slime jumped into the lava was because he saw your face lol get reck jk jk
Imagine being in Connor’s POV:<br><b>sees pewdiepie walk past him and into the house * * carries on with life</b> * see pewdiepie walk past again*<br>Pewds- dont Say a frickin word Connor<br>Connor- 0_0
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=395">6:35</a> wtf was that
Nah nah nah nah? Ooooor no no no? Which are you saying?
He just gets rid of the slime statue like some garbage
hmm
When he said he was going to hell to throw conner in the lava my heart stopped
<b>sometimes, I wish pewds would do the same thing that happened to water sheep to Connor</b>
Wtf happened, did this take place before the other ones? 🤷‍♂️🤔
when Pewdiepie blame everything bad to Connor.(◍•ᴗ•◍)
Why u really hate conner he has not done anything bruh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=745">12:25</a> bruh if you look to your left there&#39;s a slime statue just sitting right there
Water bolt. In the entrance. That&#39;s it, I quit.
Me: endgame, killed moonlord multiple times but still hasn’t found a skeleton merchant<br>Felix: finds merchant and sells a few things but brushes by him.<br><br><del>inhale</del>  <del>sniff</del> <br><br><br><br><br>AAAAAAA-
If you look at his face cam his headphones make it look like he has like a 1/6 of his face covered in hair
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1086">18:06</a> the zombie was a nice touch
Early pewds is like old pewds
If you want to get rid of Connor you have to throw the voodoo doll in lava, it’s easy
Pewds without facecam feels like the pewds black ops days
nvm cuz later in the episode it puts the original timeline that were at now ok
uhhhh wut is going on pewds pls make this an ACTUAL series cuz just its not in the right timeline since episode 2 and 3
Pewdiepie playing Terraria at 6AM is the most relatable thing
There&#39;s actually a floating island where the flying harpy or head with wings,  fly😂 nothing just leaving it hereee
WELCOME BACK TO AN EPISODE OF PEWDS THE IDIOT!!! This episode, he’s an idiot! Next episode: HE’S EVEN MORE STUPID!! AAAAHH I mean, he’s at least 6% complete in the game now 😕... he’s still an idiot! 😜
Is this a past one🤷🤷🤷
Me wipes out my portal in the large world at the dungeon: dam<br>Pewdiepie wipes out his portal in hell: god damit
6 am is a great time to play terraria
That Spore reference 👌 chef&#39;s kiss
Lol the amount of times he said I hate you Conner! alright here we are back in hell.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1700">28:20</a> that satisfaction when he slaughters all those evil slimes tho
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1085">18:05</a> legit sounded like a terraria zombie
God what happened since part 3?

Is terraria copying Minecraft or is Minecraft copying terraria
Pewdiepie: screw you connor go to hell<br>me: knowing the horrible fate waiting for Connor
Wait, shouldn&#39;t this be the second episode?
He definitely loves Connor but he pretends to hate him
imagine him doing just as good as this in mastermode and it&#39;s his first run ever
Felix: What do i do with the Voodoo doll.. can i use it to hurt Connor?<br><br>Me: thats exactly what you can do
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1651">27:31</a> me when i’m full
Wtf he has a water bolt right outside the dungeon his world is crazy good
Why does he keep using the enchanted sword
im sorry what, do you even chronological?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1360">22:40</a> kinda sound like skeletor
Its strange how much the floor has changed him
Pewds actually loves Connor he&#39;s just a Tsundere.
You are best
I love you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1002">16:42</a> Thank you Felix<br><br>Sincerely, a hardcore queen fan :)

hola amigos like si lo miras en mayo del 2020🔻🔻🔻👍👍👍
Ah the Demon Scythe, it served me well in early hard-mode.
Video starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=425">7:05</a> thank me later
Quality 100%
Anyone else notice he is playing on normal mode and not expert?
This is form like before ep3 but after 2
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1810">30:10</a> coffin dance starting
Why in part 3  he is more advanced in the game than part 4? lol
As a terraria veteran who’s been looking for the bartender npc for 6 months I am outraged he found him in the dungeon on a first try
I love how the angler never dies because he is a kid
Honestly Terraria, in the morning. This used to be my daily routine.<br>Watching this brings nostalgia..
&quot;it makes minecraft look so empty&quot;  ....True that
<b>space core was a nice touch</b>
&quot;I love hell&quot;<br>-Pewds
Connor is definitely ceiling gang <b>*cringe*</b>
Try enabling Auto Pause in settings so it freezes the game while you are on inventory and shopping menu.
Can any one gives me a games like terraria ??????? Pls ( not starbound or minecraft )
If i sit on the voodoo doll of myself will i ever manage to stand up?
What fhis suppose to be episde 3?
I&#39;m very jealous and his so lucky he found three people in the Dungeon it was suposee to be two
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1085">18:05</a> he sounds like a zombie or is that the game? XD
Epic tune <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1525">25:25</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1774">29:34</a> A respectable reference, well done editor
Did.. did he just find the old ones army npc?
Connor is WaterSheep
guys who noticed that he accidentally swapped this ep 4 and ep 3?
PLAY TERRARIA 1.4!!!!!!!
Pewdiepie: in cool clothes &amp; armour<br>Veteran: dude are you serious I am still wearing pyjamas
Pewdiepie: Shows some reaction to something new he have seen and shocked about how strong the bosses fight. <br><br>Terraria veterans: Allow us degenerate retards to introduce ourselves.
Don&#39;t say gods name in vain
Pewds: Where&#39;s satan?<br><br>Me: <b>Looking at the voodoo doll in his inventory</b> You&#39;ll meet him soon.
never mind
i think terraria 3 and 4 is mixed up
Надеюсь что а4 перегонит тебя
He did more then what me and my brother did like what how your a beginner and your better then both of us bro and he has been playing even when he was little
No
عير
The title is the same words logan paul used on his apology video😂😂
&quot;Screw you Connor, I wish you&#39;d go to hell&quot;<br><br><br>careful what you wish for felix
&quot;I love killing rich people&quot;-PewDiePie
Felix at 6 AM sounds like Felix from his 6th video
the new update comes out May 16, 2020 make sure you start a fresh playthrough to get the full experience
Imagine having the most youtube subscribers for six years, then lose to a channel about music.
He found 3 npcs in the same area
Godle is the best etjentment
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1582">26:22</a> nooo you missed a water bolt
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1026">17:06</a> did someone saw black lens? its a rare drop from skeletron.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1406">23:26</a> he sounded different. Wierd.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1140">19:00</a><br>A literal dark magician and you have nothing to say felix<br><br>I&#39;m disappointed
PewDiePie: It&#39;s EASY<br>Also PewDiePie: *plays on normal mode
He should play on expert
This confuses me why is this Part 4 when this was definitely earlier
Tf happened?
The dislikes are Connor’s clones
Basically is about building
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=424">7:04</a> perfect example of Youtubers saying “ I did a little bit off camera”
Pretty house ,☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
yes water bolt can bunce sorry if the this message is late....,,,?!L():&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;
terraria is just popitropica and minecraft when they fuse into one game
Skeleton is sans with head and arms
how come part 3 has more progress than part 4<br>I AM CONFUSED
if you hate coner equip a voodoo doll and attack him
Nice number 1 :)
you are the luckiest f**king Terraria player i have ever seen.
the climbing claws allow you to climb, the other claws just give you attack boost.
You have to put the shadow key in the box
Pewds: Plays terraria<br><br>Also Pewds: uses every weapon no matter the class
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1672">27:52</a> he missed the tally counter
Felix treats Connor like Michael does Toby
Also its pronounced man ah CRUSADE ENABLED SPRINT ENABLED INF AMMO ENABLED IDDQD  E N A B L E D
My name is connor WAIT PEWDS LET ME GO NOOOOOOoooooooo
That title and thumbnail makes you think he threw the doll in the lava but he didnt
Pewds= Micheal Scott<br>Conner= Toby
Pewds: <b>defeats second easiest boss in the game</b> terraria veteran
TERRARIA <br>TECHNICAL ?
was ep 3 and 4 out of order? okay nvm it was just the beginning

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=425">7:05</a> to anyone who was so confused and scared when everything was gone that they stopped watching ;) thank me later
PewDiePie tired at 6 am when making vudeoFlamingo does videos at 3 am almost all the time
Good old times :)
Why in this episode he has bad stuff but he has good stuff last episode
Skeletron spawns<br>Felix: <b>UNDERTALE SLASHBACKS</b>
Coronavirus : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=830">13:50</a>
Pewdiepie: busts out the yo-yo <br><br><b>terreria music intensifies</b>
going too far down in the dungeon is the terraria equivalent to sleeping in the nether
Warms my heart seeing pewdiepie enjoying terraria more than Minecraft
Мне нравится
Крутое видео
Кто русский???
maxium health is 500 or 600
Why does he have less progress than the last video
PEWDS I WAIT FOR U! I WILL BURN YOUR BIULDING IF YOU DONT PLAY!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=715">11:55</a>
Felix at the beginning of the episode: I don’t like the jungle<br><br>Felix halfway through the episode: you know what I’ve changed my mind I don’t like the jungle
Why is he farther in part 3 than part 4???
Connor is watersheep
why in ep 4 he doesent have all of his items from ep 3<br><br><br>7 mins in the vid he finally gets all of his stuff
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=840">14:00</a> is this a madaf&#39;ng Jojo reference?
I think he numbered these wrong😂
I thought pewdiepie did a mistake that is he put #2 or #3 part in this video xD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1085">18:05</a> it sounds like pewds was the zombie
Why does felix always get a decent drop from the bosses lmao

Wait was this made before episode 3?

Wait until he learns he can make a fart in a bottle.
Let me die if I can&#39;t be with you.
if you equip the guide voodoo doll you can kill conner
Please let me die. I&#39;m suffering here. I want to die. My heart is broke.
How can this man play dark souls and not know what a Murumasa is?
My name is Connor and I’m taking so much offense from this. 😔
No hate but terraria had honey since 1.2 which was in 2014

I just watched I 5 minute ad for PewDiePie.

Pewdiepie to Connor is like Michael Scott to Toby.
Jungle spores is important you can make a sword for night edge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1033">17:13</a><br>he got a black lens
What your opinion from tseries?
He&#39;s playing on medium. Am i right?
i think the numbers are off
were is all his stuff
🐁
How come he found three people in the dungeon, and it took me an hour or two to find the tavern keep?!
Please play starbound 🥺 its like terraria in space and you can legit travel to different planets and do missions n upgrade your spaceship. It&#39;s legit the best felix u would love itttt
We should call conner water conner<br><br>Pewds: PERFECT<br><br>2 days later: pewds kills conner from torchering him to much<br><br>Pewds: Conner, you were like a son to me

There is a total of 16 bosses in the game 2 are mini bosses
Anyone else notice he had creation of the guide in his dungeon
Ok si you first drop black lens and then you forget a tally counter?! Man...
Conner never did anything to you all you do is blame your stupid mistake
PEWDIEPIE  is a legend among YouTubers.

PewDiePie literally finds the best things without trying:<br><br>Terraria veterans:how.
Why does Felix has more achievements in part 3 than in part 4
PewDiePie :<br>Almost summons the wall of flesh<br><br>Me: (screaming)
I love PewDiePie

terraria logic stand on meteor block then you burn makes sense make it into armour and put it on your skin should be third degree burns but it&#39;s comepletly fine.
It’s our bois first Goblin Army 🥺🥺🥺🥺<br><br>I so proud 😭
Knockoff version of Minecraft
How he have infinite mana NANI?
This tittle by itself deserves a like.
Pewdiepie: CONNOR GET THE F*CK OUT<br>Also Pewdiepie: ALFRED GET THE F*CK IN
One of my Favorite weapons is the Tactical Shotgun you Can get from the Soldier Zombies in the Dungeon Area
Wow, pewdiepie found 4 people but 3 in dungeon! Woah, incredible! (Ocean:Sleeping Angler) (Dungeon:Goblin tinkerer, Unconcious man, bound mechanic) 1 is missing! And that is... the bound wizard! Wow, so cool that he found almost all npcs to find!

Sleepy Felix in the beginning sounds kinda cute honestly.
I&#39;m almost offended that he called himself a terraria veteran after defending skeletron in normal mode
Mother Slime: <b>commits suicide</b><br><br><br>PewDiePie: &quot;What an idiot! Jumps into lava, who would do that?&quot;
Wait til he founds out about expert mode
Ok so is he just done with terraria now or?

I guessed it, yesssss. I knew at one point he was going to accidentally click on the recall mirror!!!!
Did u lose everything?
Its honestly crazy how different his content is without a facecam to me
I liked when he was quiet...

Haha. Look how much money you spend on shit games.
Pewds: You&#39;re living with me now, bunny.<br><br><br><b>Terrarium</b> is what you need.
If he likes crafting and finding different items, he&#39;s going to love the tinkerer&#39;s workshop
Я вас не понимаю
Felix it&#39;s too lucky, he found three NPC in the dungeon, takes me 3 hours to found one Hahahah
Facecam had to go to the store<br><br><br>To buy milk<br><br><br><br><br>He&#39;ll be back<br><br><br><br><br>In a bit

This dude really finding rare weapons without even trying

PewDiePie hates Connor for killing his rabbit while PewDiePie is killing like  a ton of innocent animals 😂

Did anyone else catch the Logan Paul reference in the title or just me
sub2pewds

Wait until he finds expert mode
Confusion???
Connor is the new water sheep
Lol pewds dont know how lucky he is to find one of the 4 swords u need to make nights edge (best sword pre hard mode and used to make best sword in game) and he found the rarest one
What happened to his save file...?
I like to play terraria but i doesen&#39;t like to see videos
PewDiePie: <b>hates Connor</b><br>Connor: this emotions you are feeling are just an error in your software
The reason I love this game is you can literally say &quot;can you go to hell and mean it as a genuine question
Felix just found fvcking 3 npcs in one place dude Wtf<br>While im still here trying to find the tavern keeper and the goblin tinkerer
By the way, why was there a god in my backpack when I went to Ise Shrine? But actually, God has a younger brother. I can&#39;t easily meet her brother. God is very busy because everyone is there, but my brothers don&#39;t know. It&#39;s almost the same in terms of ability, and no, rather, my brother can do miracles from a human perspective. That&#39;s why, instead of busy God, father, mother, and brother are together. Quietly and leisurely. However, in the daytime, the god of the great star is swiftly attacking because he can be found by a human, so he is going to go at 7 PM. Thank you for that.
Connor in the hell
pewds the muramasa is used to make the nights edge, a really good weapon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=152">2:32</a> dude he put a motherfu**ing painting of himself
why are you cursing more in this video?
You baka neeee, Yoyo is awesome dont drop them
Whoops
Shouldn&#39;t this be episode 2?
this series is significantly more entertaining to watch when your ex’s name is connor
Like 2020
Why you throw away yoyo
So who&#39;s gonna tell him not to drop the voodo dool in the lava in hell?
Yes
i feel like ep 3 adn 4 were swapped
Conner=Terraria Water Sheep?
when Felix said &quot;You know who has no value? You.&quot;<br>...<br>I felt that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1776">29:36</a> SPACE CORE 😍😍😍😍
Lol i thoght the knocking was from my mom so i was like your back already!?
Where is your face

I have questions about multiple comments
Hey pewds. If your reading this... <br><br><br><br>Better grind before throwing connor to hell
Wtf? Im so jealous, why does he get the cobalt shield in the first chest? Hahahaha
Pewds: why am i burnin? &quot;fire blocks&quot; <br>Veterans: screaming obsidian skull
Pewds without facecam feels like a typical game walkthrough
MORE

He just had to play it so bad he woke up at 6am
THAT FRICKING SONIC 2 DROWNING MUSIC GAVE ME PTSD

Is Connor the wotr  sheep of terraria?
i like his murderous laugh
I play terraria so i am a terrarian and want to set point in underworld make a house or a room to do it
Why is your health initialized to 100 LMFAO
Im not a veteran but i got the game a week ago and know a lot of things now
This is the real episode 3. Episode 4 should be the one before this.
Pewds on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1761">29:21</a><br>IF I COULD FALLLL INTO THE SKYYYY
This was before terraria 3 i think
Goes into the dungeon with a battle potion equipped 💀
The reason he’s swearing is he isn’t in a Cristian minecraft Server
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=720">12:00</a> You can&#39;t be stressing me out with that music so suddenly, that shit terrified me as a kid
Use shadow key in hell I is a terraria vet I know things
&lt;3
Felix has unbelievable luck! First he finds a non fake enchanted sword shrine on accident and it’s real! Second, he finds goblin tinkerer in the dungeon. Holy shit

My favourite part was when ‘invisible man’ came on.
Wow pewd...my idol..👍

honestly pewds is a tsundere for connor
Connor&#39;s probably Water Sheep 2
&quot;Boneweilder, that&#39;s what your mom is&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1749">29:09</a> my brain is messed up with confusion
The energy change has me dead
me wondering how pewds is so good at pve but is a big boi newbie - me realising that he is playing on a baby normal mode
PewDiePie will have to fight moonlord in a while, he will basically be fighting his worst enemy, an extraterrarian being with a lack of legs and enough eyes to look down upon everyone and thing on earth as if they looked down from the moon. Legless.
Why is he still wearing wood armour he’s literally been to hell and back
why do i feel bad for connor
who else cringed when he threw away the slime statue
The goblin army is like the raid in minecraft
Felix : threw the slime statue<br>Me : <b>You ruin an investment</b>
Felix at 6 am<br>No energy<br>No expression<br>Swears<br>Afterwards:<br>Full of energy<br>Baby voice
Pewds:*makes annoying noises*<br><br>Skeletron:just godamm stop!!
Moreeee
With the mechanic you can make machines I made a door that opened by itself I just used a pressure plate
Tungsten now: is op very early game<br>Pewdiepie: <b>no knock back? No make</b>
him I love killing rich people me you a murder
This was the beginning of an endless loop...
What’s next
Why is episode 3 so far ahead of episode 4
LEts get to 20 subs
Doughnut 0 boy
So that’s one sub for 3 subs
If you do reply subbed and I sub to you on 3 acc

If he thinks that Terraria it&#39;s amazing guess what he&#39;d think with jojo&#39;s mods omg
Vs the brain of Cthulhu
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=475">7:55</a> JackSepticeye cryin at the corner

Man i can&#39;t wait til he gets fricked up in hard mode
Go to heaven
every pro: you just threw that slime statue away like it was trash you monster
so is connor the new water sheep, or is it Alfred?
Felix: Ok bunny you live with me now<br><br>Bunny: <b>sweating Peele guy meme</b><br><br>imagine being able to put memes or pictures in your comments
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=735">12:15</a> brings back old memories.
Pewdiepie liking games makes me happy
I stand corrected. You can tell I don&#39;t watch his DLive like i used to.
Pewdiepie: everybody knows water sucks<br>Everybody: a minute of silence for water sheep
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=536">8:56</a> why am I laughing so hard?
First video with the mad face
Tell him to get the terra blade.
Sives subtle editing so funny
Pewdiepie : &quot;i love killing rich people&quot;<br><br>Mrbeast : IGHT IMMA BOUTTA HEAD OUT...
Feels good to hear him talk normal.
Wait did he lose his world or something?
WHY IS PEWDIEPIE SO GOD DAMN LUCKY IN EVERY GAME HE PLAYS???!
Sive&#39;s edits make Pewds&#39; playthrough so much funnier 😆
Pewds while playing terraria: there’s honey block in <b>minecraft</b>
Did he start a new world
Is this the beginning of a new thumbnails era?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=473">7:53</a><br>&quot;What an idiot! jumps into LAVA. Who would do that?&quot;<br><b>Laughs in Irish</b>
Hmmake btoadswords not shorts broad does more damage and longer range
So no one‘s gonna talk about how ep 4 takes place before ep 3??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1180">19:40</a> this man really threw out a black lense<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=1680">28:00</a> this man really left behind a tally counter
Pewdiepie:*Shouts* <b>GOOD MORNING GAMERS!</b> <br><br><br>Marzia:There he is again..
Pewdiepie: I love killing rich people<br>Felix: <b>sweating</b>
Felix:I&#39;m not afraid to kill a old man <br>Me:sweating
Epic
Why was there an intro from before episode 3??
Why is episode 3 recorded after episode 4?
It all started here. That smile, that damned smile
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeteMdY2dtw&amp;t=958">15:58</a> this man found it on the first day, on his first time breaking a book...<br><br><br><br><br><b>I&#39;m in hardmode and has checked over 9 dungeons and have not fucking found it</b>
