Dom can have zero horsepower and it wouldn&#39;t make a difference if they all pull in opposite directions
Fun fast and furios nice super😎😎😎😎😎
Imagine if there&#39;s Brian in the middle of all this
Wouldn&#39;t it be easier if they could block him by slamming their cars into his car

movie name?
Did nobody think of idk taking out those round things beneath Dom&#39;s car?
When it comes to street fighting, the street always wins.
Can we just talk about how absolutely braindead the 2, 3 and 5 thousand horsepower dialogue is? <br>For a film that has a heavy focus on cars, this is just ridiculously stupid.

5000hp? What is it? A stealth bomber lol
Is funny how they think the could take out dom is funny how the rock was saying u better have about 2000 horse power is cuz he knew that dom was gonna get away with it and on top of that is crazy how they was holding him dom still managed a way to get out from  it.😭😭😭
Movie name
What they didnt know was that dom had specialized STEEL, he had actually poured some of his sweat and taken 2 chain links out from his necklace to bond w the high strenth steel, .so it basically turned it into DOM-BRANIUM.....people say its stronger than CAPTAIN AMERICAS SHIELD.....😅😅😅😅
Since when did Don get Hulk like strength? Head butt a door and it flies off the hinges! Lol
some shii i do on a friday afternoon
Hi
What car is Jason Statham/Deckard Shaw driving? I know it&#39;s a Jaguar but I don&#39;t know the model.
His own family
If only they had one of those EMP harpoons from 2 Fast 2 Furious.
No one gonna talk about how a car with 5000 hp would be pretty much undriveable?<br><br>No braking system in the world would be able to stop his car, and just idling his car would have him either tearing his car apart via torque or idling at like 60mph?????
Koi betayega ye kon sa part ka seen hai
✝️🕶️✝️
&quot;Stop working on it and do it.&quot;<br><br>Thanks for the advice.
*Physics has left the chat
the rock
Can anyone explain to me how the tires or those vehicles didn&#39;t explode or melt??
why did they harpoon the car
Dom is bad in this episode

I love how with the power of Family, he became a Family, to beat his own Family
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=143">2:23</a> Gotta give dom credit using the cars behind him as power to drag Romans car.
Came here for a good, laugh, did not<br>disappoint…… Man Fast and the Furious<br>really fell from grace since the six<br>movie that was my favorite one smh
Epic moment dom is king of cars in faf.<br>1. Dom ( king of cars ) <br>2. Brian ( king of run )<br>3. D.K  /  Sean ( king of drift )
You know, these idiots could&#39;ve shot out Dom&#39;s engine block with a 20 mm AP shell or sprayed the car with corrosive acid....but this is F&amp;F. No one&#39;s that smart.
I like that Dom isnt driving a Charger in this scene, its a Plymouth GTX which is out of character for Dom, its nice to see him drive different branded cars every once in a while.
Guy,wow nice!❤
I love how the people around the scene just go about their business 😂
So we’re not gonna talk about how dom literally popped off his door with his elbow like bruh 💀
Did he just break a car door with his shoulder
Reminds me of that one scene from Hitman Agent 47
Love how he gives the door a nudge and it comes off flying towards the rock 😂
Did anyone ever play that Action Man game where you pretty much just drove around doing this exact thing? pretty sure I&#39;m not imagining that that game existed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=158">2:38</a>break the door car😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=147">2:27</a>kkkkk😂😂😂
Roman Pearce saying “No no no no, it’s my Bentley” at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=137">2:17</a> makes me laugh every time 😂
Physics: &quot;Alright, I&#39;m gonna head out, you kids be good!&quot;<br><br><b>The Kids</b>
&quot;Its a family thing&quot;
How did fast and furious go from racing and drifting all the way to international spies, and space flight
Here before viral 🔥🔥
Looks like his power is over 9000.
Dom: screw the rules i have family
Kno<br> It&#39;s my bently
The real victim here is roman bentley

This I was laughing because it was soo fake it’s unreal 😅😅😅
Good part of the movie
No matter the horse power or the tork, only matter the Family and its power 🫡
just wanna say to  believe in Jesus for he loves u so much that he died and was raised from the dead so that u can have a relationship with him. Believe in him and ask GOD for forgiveness of your sins :) and turn away from them as well (repent)...
Is it just me or at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=116">1:56</a> when they show Letty&#39;s car her wheels are spinning as if in drive and not reverse?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=90">1:30</a> they pulled one car in different direction and they question why the car has so much horsepower
en realidadcuantos caballos de potencia  el carro de dom
They could have sandwiched dom from all sides and put in handbrake. Easy.
Dom should go against the hot wheels and Disney Pixar cars and transformers but at the end of the day he’ll win because he got family
นี่แหละพลังของดอม
Just elbows a car door off
Those are some small wheels for 5000HP LOL
I know it’s sad that Dominic how to turn like that. But funny when Roman said no no not my baby ahhhhhh
can&#39;t take my eyes off the passerbys casually walk by
Roman: no no no it&#39;s my Bentley 🤣🤣🤣
welcome back to bottom gear m8s, tonight ....
By pulling in opposite directions the vehicles are working against each other 😆
Impossible! How could Dom do that in this 8th Fast and Furious film?!!!
Rocks car alone would of kept him
Comments kill me more than logic
5000hp lmao
🥱
Get it, I am you&#39;re &quot;brother&quot;
Now** Dom it&#39;s Jacob.
Dom&#39;s Charger is made of vibranium...😂
Cool but dumb scene. They could&#39;ve just boxed him instead of doing that.
That Bentley alone weights more then that Plymouth Gtx and it wouldnt matter if he had 5k hp he would just sit there an spin, god these movies should have ended with Paul
Without context, this scene makes no sense though I&#39;m not sure if having context would help at all
I’ve only ever watched the first 3 F&amp;F movies and therefore knew these as racing movies, but I’ve now also seen a couple clips on YT of more recent ones. Sooooo, they’re harpooning cars and fighting guys who are robots now…?
Isn’t dom’s car 8000hp?
Watching these clips after quiting fast and furious series since tokyo drift is so weirdly funny. Like wtf is going on.
Physics is operated by Dom
<b>Cop pulls Dom over</b><br><br>Cop: You were doing 120 In a 65, what’s the rush pal? <br><br>Dom: I got family.<br><br>Cop: uhhhh okay but that still doesn’t answer my-<br><br>Dom: that device you used to track my speed, look at it again<br><br><b>Cop looks at radar. There’s a picture of a mom, dad, and three kids</b><br><br>Cop: what the hell that doesn’t even make-<br><br>Dom: that phone call you’re gonna get in 3-2-1..<br><br><b>cop’s phone rings</b> <br><br>Cops wife: hey when are you getting off babe, the whole Family is here <br><br><b>Cop gets off the phone, still shaken up</b><br><br>Dom: <br><br>Cop: <br><br>…<br><br>Cop: you’re free to go Sir
Dom playing poker: <br>“I see your call for 200k, and I’ll raise to 5 families”
Fun fact, Greta actually owns Dom&#39;s car and did all the stunt driving.
I wonder if anyone could&#39;ve shot the tires while they were holding onto Dom like he was driving a 5000000 hp alien space shuttle about to teleport into space.
&quot;Try 5&quot;<br><br><br>This single scene sums out how stupid Fast and Furious has become
Double alfa is actually helping Dom to get rid of harpoons by pulling him forward
Remeber when Dom was a (almost) normal human being and crashed his dad&#39;s Charger because he was distracted?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=164">2:44</a> You can see Dom shifts to family gear. Love that custom gear.
Did this man just shoulder bump a car door completely off
RIP PnB Rock
Ya me quiero salir

Dom
This whole scene is cringe 🤣
So do movies just hate the audience now?
Those poor cars 😥😢
It&#39;s like hunters capturing a beast
thats a cute car :D
How many gears does that car have?!
Who needs physics when you have a family
Its so fake 😆 🤣 that truck would off ripped that charger to shreds and that bentley would have tanked the ram and outpowered him lol, bentleys are heavy af, never understood these films but I still enjoy them
Fun fact: those switches Dom flicked turned off the physics
yes
Fast and furious has turned into a avengers movie
😈🦹
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=110">1:50</a> &quot;Try five.&quot; I just love some of Jason Statham&#39;s lines.
I love how the parts of the dodge doesn&#39;t care on the pull given by other cars
OK, at some point Dom’s tires would’ve had to gone out as much time as he burned out
just harpoon him from every direction, and make sure he is not going anywhere..... <br><br>for what? to show off tire burning out? to show us how stupid the team without torreto?<br><br>why not just shot harpoons from 1 direction and drag him with 5 cars to where ever they want? even better, why not just shot the tire and he will go fast and furious on foot
M15+ action violence and coarse language
The girl has a mitsuka rock star
i have never watched any of the F&amp;F movies... well i believe i saw Tokyo Drift when i was young, but when i first saw this scene... especially when that... Bentley? had the Harppoon launcher on the top of the car, i knew it would have the worst day... XD cause seriously who has a Launcher on top of something unless they designed the thing to work with said launcher
&quot;No, no, no, no, this my Bentley!&quot; OMG, Roman 😂😂😂😂
Average Ohio street
It’s actually my dream car
That Mercedes gt is stunning
Roman: No, no, no, no! It&#39;s my Bently! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
В реальности гарпун просто порвали бы металл машины и выпали наружу...
This movie was like a fever dream
The Fast and the Furious movies, where the main characters, even Paul Walker&#39;s character, don&#39;t care about collateral damage, or others getting killed.
A yes 2000/3000hp in a V8
Why didn’t they just aim for his tires ?
Changer with russian tank engine 😂✌️
Anyone know the name of the red car...?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=170">2:50</a>
DODGE IS GOD&#39;S CAR!!!!!!!!
Isaac Newton would withdraw from science and become a bartender if he sees this movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=158">2:38</a> he gains super powers and can break the door by a nudge and angry face 🤣
Honestly how did this movie franchise sink so low?
How can a door knock over a truck
They couldn’t use spikes ? Or even tranquillise him ?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😅🤣😂😂🤣😅🤣😂😂😂😂😅😅🤣🤣😂😂🤣😅😅🤣😂😂🤣😅🤣<br> Adding more horsepower,  so a situation with zero traction is really going to help, 3,000 horsepower. You&#39;d probably actually be better off in a 1.6 Honda civic manual. To feel out the traction.
Why all this action all what they have to do is keep chasing dom until his car run out of fuel
Imagine if Brian comes to stop Dom
Can&#39;t believe this was released 5 years ago.
i wonder if hobbs using bobcat excavator instead jeep
The charger is just so badass
And this is why I hate fast and furious lol
Dom Toretto
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=157">2:37</a> Hobbs truck couldn&#39;t pull that door but Dom&#39;s left elbow did the job.
Most realistic Fast and the Furious scene:
Car burnouts
Wow that door packs a punch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=158">2:38</a>
They act soooo Bad WTF 😂
Most cars have Race mode But not in Dom’s case he has “Family Mode” Instantly Makes your car break the laws of physics
I don&#39;t know that Bollywood director directed this movie
Lmao what even is this?

0 rev matching. Unrealistic
wow
Weird that they deleted the scene where he kicks de passenger’s door to get rid of shaw
Love how the people still casually walk around like nothing’s happening.
Why did they even use bentley in street racing
Now that what i call &quot;dodge&quot;
It&#39;s fast and furious not fate and furious
So apparently police just don&#39;t exist anymore. Dom and crew have complete impunity to street laws
To be honest, i only liked this because of the cuda, especially the sound of the roaring v8

What is dom’s car name ?
this movie is really beyond ridiculous even if you try to watch it as a action movie for fun
Modern muscle cars lack torque, that roadrunner was all motor baby

They could have shot the tires
8,000lbs truck and like 1,500 he can’t pull the door off but don’t can nudge it off lmao
Plymouth V8 just built like that
Physics be like....&quot;am i a joke to you ?&quot;
When they harpoon Don’s car, they’re pulling!! They’re pulling hard!! They have a good horsepower grip!!
Aint no way the 8th one came out 5 years ago. Wtf
The Fart of the Furious
Dom&#39;s car is screaming with lots of power I love this part.
POV: My Tryhard friends when I 6v1 them and still win lol
Funny how the people didn&#39;t run when they saw the gun but waited till he shot it🤣...they really think he bluffing?
We&#39;ve concluded from this clip that dom&#39;s car is invulnerable considering that it got pulled by 4 ton truck and 4 others cars with over 400 hp.
some bullshit
F is for furious since he lost his Fate
My holy moly people would like a rock and I don’t leg rub your rock is so dumb rocket dummy Rocosa the rescue no Rocket a boat rockers do you wanna watch
Holy moly day everybody tell me the tell me the er so dumb
Guys rock is calling me in a messenger rock and sake calling me
Oh my god girl that’s rock rock rock is not even sure it’ll
Thanos used infinity stones to destroy infinity stones..<br>Same Dom used Power of family to defeat family.
ONE OF THE GREATEST SCENES I&#39;VE SEEN
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br><br>Autoscum
It’s crazy that he can probably handle 6 cars
I love how Hobbs 3 ton truck failed to rip off the door, but one push from Dom threw it off
&quot;NO&quot;<br> &quot; N O O O &quot;
The bemper really strong 😂
You’d think they have installed, idk, like 3 or more harpoons that could attach to different spots on the car since he drove a military PICKUP truck but you know
Dumb movie, but I can&#39;t get over how beautiful Plymouth GTX is.
Those car doors are stronger than my future<br><br>Edit: just saw Dom elbow the door and it went flying. His elbow is more powerful than my will to live<br><br>Edit: Those axle bearing are weaker than my love for God
spread the gospel before its to late God and Jesus are real and there coming back soon go to church and receive the gift of God repent as well Amen spread this message ✝️
Bro these movies literally don’t make sense anymore
No more like lance Armstrong urine
Background extras are something, you have 5 cars wrangling a car and there are people casually walking, not stopping and watching not running, just a casual walk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=164">2:44</a> bro got family gear wtf 💀💀
Lmao 5000 horsepower.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=122">2:02</a><br>Mah man literally turned on family mode of the car....
Another thing that annoys me lol these guys are rich as hell and yet they are still using handheld radios, you’re telling me these dudes can’t afford Bluetooth radio headsets? Always gotta be dramatic with talking on the handhelds lol
What kind of a FcuKin illogical  nonsense is this..even if you got 5000 horses, you only have two tyres to put it down..🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
This is so stupid… I love it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=166">2:46</a> bro they fr added the goofy ahh walk sound effect 💀💀💀💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=60">1:00</a> he was not worried about being harpooned, he was surpised they actually went that far too destroy his car.
Why can’t gta make a DLC like this

Anyone remember when these films were about street racing lol

Why they have to make everythin so..... 🤷‍♂️
Funny moments:<br>Roman:no I don&#39;t wanna go swimming lol 😂😂😂😂😂

Is this real. Could I use this technique to get away from someone after taking their stickers
As cringe as this film was, there&#39;s no denying that this burnout scene was absolutely badass<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=108">1:48</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=115">1:55</a>

Wait so the more horsepower the car has the harder it is to pull? Is this fast furious logic or real? 🗿
Car stop pls stop
Which paart is this of fast and furious

Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38
is that the ROCK?!
Lets say he really had 5k horses. Those tires couldn’t hold up as long as it did, car would be drivable. I know its a movie but just wanted to get it off my chest lol
Lets say he really had 5k horses. Those tires couldn’t hold up as long as it did, car would be drivable. I know its a movie but just wanted to get it off my chest lol
I boost us American motor vehicles it does not make sense
When I first watched this scene, I was not surprised when The Rock pulled up in a truck when everyone else had either a muscle car or sports car
Lucky killer cars got no problems, with towing and special jobs.
So cringe
For anyone who doesn&#39;t know what  car doms driving its a plymouth GTX
Could have blocked him in lol
Try one Infinity stone, try 5…, TRY 6 👀🫣🦍🦍🦍🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠
why did  no one just think to put a few rounds in doms engine bay or tires i know its a movie and that would be less entertaining but come on
The harpoons never hit him
What really upsets me is they make it so unrealistic. The realism stopped at 5 but I did enjoy 6 a little.
Fun fact: Dom’s car is powered by Compound V
naaa naaaa es un asco esta escena
It was never about cars , it was always about destroying cars .
me:oh nice<br>&quot;realize something&quot;<br>me:wait a min, THE ROCK IS HERE?!
Wait what exactly what their goal, to stay in that position until what
لطفا بگید
این سریع و خشن چند
Remember when this movie franchise was just about car races and money? Good times.
The tame sheet pathogenetically warn because bull causally scatter outside a vacuous switch. ordinary, unsuitable wax
I love how almost every character in this series have a plot armor
Ah yes, the F gear, Family gear. Nothing beats that.
i Belive at the Charger&#39;s 3000hp now
No one asked for more Fast &amp; Furious films! No. 7 was the real Finale to the franchise.

I dont get why they didnt just shoot his car with some sort of EMP disabler
May be the director watch this video &quot;Renault 18 Diesel Publicité (1981)&quot;
I love how in the background people are just walking around their daily business, as if 5 cars harpooning another was just a daily thing...

I got over the furious movies after a few movies. &quot;How are we going to tackle the next terrorist?&quot; &quot;Sir, maybe we have them drive electric cars, they will never hear them coming&quot;
Wouldn&#39;t it have been easier if they just harpooned/shot his tires?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=127">2:07</a><br> yes officer, it&#39;s stock.
Just when you thought this movie couldn&#39;t possibly come up with something dumber than this scene.  Ludacris and Tyrese fly a car into space.
Wow this all looks a bit silly
did a door just flip over a truck that probably weights 20k pounds?

if there was a battle between these cars in beauty, this is VERY accurate. plymouth won.
Can’t wait to see the fact that Optimus Prime is Dom’s uncle
Hey
1.43 what is horsepower in dom car. Can anybody tell and explain what is horsepower
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=205">3:25</a> the rock is here
Gotta have about 2000 hp<br>Try 3000<br>Try 5
Shhh, man what the hell? This is funny when all those cars harpooning and pull it, dom car should be destroyed, but all of them get wreck because of that thing? Real silly
Just loving the comments😁😁
Why r they attacking each other aren’t they family or somethin. Idk I haven’t seen the movie
Not this time Dumd !
And this is why I hate these movies now,
No no no, this my Bently 😂
This was a sight to behold in Theaters
How many &#39;family&#39; comments are on this video? lol
The rock so big he driving a bus

I havent watched this film series since the 3rd one. Street racing got a lot more competative.
Watch the drag or the line will snap.....
This is what happens if you still let a 1970s monster to survive the millennium.
fairytale (bullshit)
I like how the public dont see whats happening lmao
When I first seen this thing, I thought little nobody was brian’s brother
Watch this beautiful Chechen 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Why physics set to be ignored in every action film 😂😂.<br>Tightly pulled the car by others in 360°, okay got it that hero&#39;s car must be giving force towards the earth centre to balance them 😂😂
The international harvester mxt would drag all of those cars by it self
Efir
Semangat terus ya
Dom: <b>Boop</b><br>Door: My Time has come
I didn&#39;t realize one of The people with harpoons is The rock
This scene is such bullshit
Masterpiece
Do they still cell gtxs
Dom use his road runner
Doms car must be powered by something from a different dimension
Family
Family betrayed :((
dom&#39;s charger might be  more poweful than thanos
just the sounds of the cars make me so happy
I Love FAF and I love dom he&#39;s my favorite
I guess Dom is only one who can see John Cena
I want to buy Doms car 😂
STUPID…
Now let’s see Paul Allen drive
Useless scene
I mean a subway cop can just come and shoot the tires...
Is that car filled with kerosene or what
And I&#39;m sitting here, wondering how people can watch this stuff<br>Like, they could&#39;ve called it a parody for accuracy&#39;s sake at least
Dollar tree happy birthday ☕ party 🥳 🎉 Lol surprise ☕, happy birthday party Yvette Dollar tree happy birthday jayila, Gonzalez Johnnie Gonzalez ♥ 😲 😂 😄
Manhattan day time no traffic????
Fans of this series are like &quot;wow new fast and furious it&#39;s gonna be so good&quot; meanwhile last good movie was FaF Tokyo drift. Every newer one is just ridiculous piece of crap with worse CGI and worse story every new movie.
Dom’s charger to dom: never gonna give you up
That&#39;s pretty cool that they have so many action stars in this now. But uhh, what is going on... lol
Shoot the tyres? Anyone? Or everybody crash into him...
Thank god for ad blocker
Damn
Bro why they got harpoons on their cars?? XD
<i>“His horsepower level’s over 9000!”</i>
To jako vážně???!!! Tak na tohle může koukat jenom blbec!! To už je moc
Such a stupid franchise. I thought they just robbed 18 wheelers for car parts. This got far fetched pretty quick... I&#39;ll admit it I&#39;ve seen all them but still.... 🤨
this is literally so dumb lmao
Worst movie series ever... this should be a cartoon
Might be the single dumbest scene in the history of this dumb franchise
Dominic 1 : 0 Physics
Ну ебать сказки, для какой публики это снято....
Someone forgot the physics?
Brain damaged.
This scene is so realistic on so many levels. <br>First having harpoons installed which all perfectly attached.<br>Second having more grip on one single car than on all other combined. <br>Third driving long stretches on NY streets in the middle of the day with no traffic.
I can’t wait till they stop making these
As cool as this scene is, it doesn’t work like that. The higher horsepower doesn’t mean higher chance of breaking free. It just means you’ll spin a lot more when you’re anchored like that 😂
Тупее этой сцены только её исход
wow, I&#39;m glad I stopped watching these movies, so stupid.
So much stupid ideas in the latest movies , sorry for blaming but it got so out of mind ….
No matter how much horsepower there is, with it all going to two small wheels, it’s not dragging away all the cars strapped to it. Must be the power of family on that car.
Ah yes when the tires are spinning ur creating more traction
Like Tony Montana vs Sosas Assasins in Car Version 😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=72">1:12</a> pause
Absolute trash
Dom is very powerful, his body is very ripped. That&#39;s why he could escape. Rock could have stopped him but he didn&#39;t shift any gears this those big arms...
indian movies suck
Holy f... shiat. This is exactly why I cant watch these movies since part 2. I died almost of cringe by this 3 minutes. wouldnt survive the whole shitbag
Such a stupid movie..
this movie franchise should have died a long, long time ago.
*hits nos <br><br>*miraculously gains grip
Bro do cops not exist in this city??? This is what happens when you defund the police 🤦🏻‍♂️
What if the line Roman shot just went straight through the windshield and into Dom&#39;s chest? lol
The fact that they thought it was realistic enough for an old Charger to make a boat like Continental GT fly into a front flip lmao
Got this movie is soo stupid
This is hilariously bad
Lol! O he&#39;s uncontrollable. <br>We gotta hold him down  lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=6">0:06</a> wow
Абсурдность этого видео поражает🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
This is so unrealistic on so many levels
После 4-ой части, франшиза умерла
Interviewer: What’s the reason behind your engine’s crazy strength <br>Dom: I have F A M I L Y
this movie make star wars seem like a documentary
I missed watching this movie in 2018 and 2019.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=164">2:44</a> love his custom gear setup<br>1: 1st gear<br>2: 2nd gear<br>3: 3rd gear<br>N: Neutral<br>F: Family gear
Why doesn&#39;t my car have a cool red button
No one beats the FAMILY
Even the power of family couldn’t stop Dom Toretto.
why didn’t they even try to flat his goddamn tire?
Try 3000!!!
It wouldn&#39;t called &quot;Muscle car&quot; for a reason
In Time Thrilling Action Movie 2021 Full HD - YouTube
I like how none of them got the idea to pop Dom&#39;s tires while he was immobilized.
That’s one badass Plymouth also not a charger for your information people
Dom ‘s charger has about three thousand hp and with nos<br>that should be about five thousand or elven thousand so that should give boost because that’s how he escaped because even they have the upper hand against dom dom still has more power in his charger than they hav combined because if dom didn’t have nos he probably not escaped because the nos gives the car more power and boost so that’s how dom got the upper hand
One must wonder how much weight was in the back of that car. The amount of traction required....
Honestly not the most rediculois thing I can imagen the least realistic is they every cable didn’t just tear off the thing it was attached to other then that I could see this possibly working now what happened with dom in the recent one that was just wrong
Idk what the outcome was meant to be here
No matter how many horses you have. It&#39;s physics
I’ll watch when zombies come along
Logic ? Physics gone 😂
Anyone who builds engines knows how ridiculous the dialogue was about the engine horsepower numbers. <br><br>Donut Media even makes fun of it.
In all honesty. The first three movie were great. Tokyo Drift imo is the best movie they made.
<b>Family</b> <br>wow, just wow
Dom what happened to ✨family✨
the only good scene in this clip was when jason statham got shot and fell. sold that really well imo
So what if he has 5000 horsepower? Torque is the thing that matters in this situation...
The rare Carpoon
Pure blood bullshit
Funny movie 🤣🤣🤣
Cocaine and Hollywood. A horrific combination
You might think that, they can just ram into dom&#39;s car when he was surounded.<br>But yall dont realize that dom has a family barrier around his car.
the &#39;comic relief&#39; bits in these movies is stupid
what a load of rubbish, the doors would have been ripped of
Dkldkddñls
I love how a series about cars has the most unrealistic car performance. Not only do the cars perform in ways that defy the laws of physics, they seem indestructible to the point that their performance doesn&#39;t alter with damage.
Dom s car gtx is 3000 horse power
<b>For family</b>
Low power means lower gear not higher wtf
Oh come on...it&#39;s not about power, it&#39;s about grip...
should have stopped after tokyo drift this series is such a joke that i wouldnt be surprised if thanos showed up and they defeat them with family in the next movie
still the best than the 9
&quot;No,No,No ,Not my Bentley!&quot; <br><br>Like bro why tf did you bring it if you didnt want it damaged
Those door panels must be made of unobtainium
Under the hood of dom’s car is his family. Literally, he kidnapped them last night and tired them up before welding them to the insides of the car
Imagine if Paul Walker was still alive and was in this scene
They guessed it that charger is more than family . It is mission impossible to fight Jesus .
What&#39;s the model of the red car?
they act as if more power is gonna change the fact that he has no traction????
Абсолютно идиотская сцена
this was stupid logic, instead they try to pull the car...better they push it
I just want everyone to reflect back to the first movie and think about how we got to this point :)
Me:Could this happen?<br><br>Dom: Dont matter as long as you have….family.<br><br>Me:👁👄👁
Old american muscle was powerful than 5 car
One hit is all it takes, <br>to rip his cardoor mate, <br>possibilities are endless with family..<br>~Family Lipa probably
I love the man said “nonono it’s my baby”
Corvette has abs but the Mercedes doesn&#39;t
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=158">2:38</a> WTF
To the street races to a stupid nonsense bs!!!
Traffic be like : Nahi theek hai, tum ye kr lo pehle..
i need a fast and furious film directed by rohit shetty
5000hp lol
NCAP ratings :500/5
I wonder what they were planning on doing after &quot;stretching him out&quot; and &quot;holding&quot; him in place
Dom: I am gonna end this guys whole career<br>Physics : 😳😳😢😭😭
How is that door holding? Must be 3000hp for that door alone
Tata steel se bni hai dom ki car
Dom:struggles to escape<br>Dom:realizes he has something more powerful<br>Dom:shifts to family gear <br>Agents :flips all over the place
Esta chebre
Try 10,000 buffalo horsepower!!!!!
Went from racing to saving the world 😂
As a lifelong car/ Motorsport enthusiast, and a physics nerd, I stuck it out with the franchise up until this scene. After that, I had to tap out. Suspension of belief doesn’t work when you’re shouting “BULLSHIT!” every 3 minutes.
But what&#39;s real is family
It would’ve been cool if the Mercedes logo became the grappling hook.
Mother very bad choice of words that&#39;s a very s*<b>**</b> thing to say how&#39;s the weather out there
what the hell is this. not even realistic lol
Beautiful cars destroyed for a lame scene, like it couldnt have been done using cgi..
OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.. How stupid do you think people are to try to pull off that scene? Yes, there is such a thing as &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; that people will let SOME things go in movies even if they seem unbelievable. But they pushed WAY to far with that scene, i mean come on...🙄🙄🙄
This whole franchise became a joke😂😂
Power toyota celica
no ones mad about dom punching a door off?
family
I am more impressed by that door than its engine.
There is literally no logic in this scene
Remember when they used to tune up Japanese cars and race it? Good times.
FAKE!
Even though this is super unrealistic it’s still a pretty cool scene to watch
After seeing this part I just realized why he was able to get out, he put the gear to &quot;F&quot; meaning Family, and you know how powerful that is.
Sir i used your video a small clip for making a fact video so please you don&#39;t give me any copyright.
Everyone: this is impossible<br>Me: Dom freaking out at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=95">1:35</a>  for first time in series is even more impossible
hollywood is becoming more and more like bollywood i swear
i know it&#39;s a fictional movie and all,<br>but one them should&#39;ve really got out of their car and took a pitstop at those front tires. or maybe just jacked the back off the ground.<br>also props to them for taking mostly lower torque low weight cars to take down a heavy american torquestallion.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=119">1:59</a> &quot; Get out of there&quot;<br>Vin: I&#39;m working on it<br>C: Stop working on it and do it<br><br>Such advice . Much help.  Wow
ภาพนี้สุดๆ😊😊
Biggest load of shyte ive ever scene.
I like the fact how there talking about horse power and Taj and Hobbs sound slightly panicked, mean while Shaw is calm and collected, zero care was givin in that moment.
I watch the newest Fast and Furious just to laugh at them
I&#39;m amazed how they estimate the horsepower on that car just by doing a burnout
He is groot
Фильм дерьмо
This was filmed in downtown Cleveland :)
In a situation like this, hp is of no use, there’s still only 4 tires in contact, just means it might burn rubber a bit easier.
I here too
Dom&#39;s entire car is held together by F A M I L Y
The comment section is full of family😂
I like how the cars are powered by their personalities
This is some <b>perfect</b> “Just turn off your brain and enjoy the action” content.  Don’t gotta worry about the science or whatever. Just stupid fun action
He should have just opened the door would have been more believable if it snapped off that way
Best
The human spider
Physics be like I&#39;m gonna take a quick nap..
One day we gon look back at this scene and we will realize how goofy fast and furious has came to
Fun fact it&#39;s over 9000.
they pull him from all directions, car doesnt move in any single direction…: surprised pikachu face
Plot twist: The Fast from &quot;The fast and furious&quot; refer to how fast things get ridiculous, and the furious is from the loyal fans who keeps getting disappointed after every sequel come out.
Well nobody think about taking out the tires , i see ;)
This is lowkey a badass scene
Now we just need a Fast &amp; Furious X Transformers X  Jurrasic Park X Marvel&#39;s crossover.
That thing has to have at least 2,000 plot armor<br>Try 3,000
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=73">1:13</a> 😏
This is truth story happened in AstroJalo
If Brian was there they would’ve caught him.
6000 hp
I love a car door was able to knock over the rocks truck
Viva el Fast and el Furious ....  I drive an american muscle since 1982 AND I have on my C10 1979 : a 572 CI ZZ DELUXE 720R ... I live in France
Dom is a Terminator
So stupid, very stupid, the scene is ridiculous
ة
We all know who can stop him. RIP 🎉🎉
Dom’s charger is inevitably powerful lol
Man got thousand horse power
Anyone else here had a thought that the only person who could stop dom in this scene was brian??
Casual Roman in a bentley
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=168">2:48</a>
This scene is the equivalent to getting shot 5 times and not hitting a vital organ 💀
Captain man can beat Dom and shaw and hobbs
Kid danger can beat Dom hobbs and shaw
Could’ve just t boned him with that semi lmao
Worst spot for a wire ON TOP OF YOUR CAR
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=158">2:38</a> that&#39;s impossible. How the door put that truck on its side
3,0000HP ?!?!? <br>I just google Bugatti and VOILA they still haven’t touched the FAMILY HP
Dom just need family to win
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=127">2:07</a> that supercharger is screaming 8000 rpms and it sounds so nice
Fun fact: that Charger is powered by a 7.0l HEMI with 800 Familypower
<b>Dom&#39;s car is powered by 5000 horsepower</b><br><br>Newton:*Ladies and gentlemen, I think my brain just exploded*
<b>Dom&#39;s car is powered by 5000 horsepower</b><br><br>Newton:*Ladies and gentlemen, I think my brain just exploded*
fiksi
Someone could get out of the car and point a gun but no let’s keep talking about horsepower
I love how it’s not Dom the regular man. It’s Dom the Thanos!!! 🤣
I do t get it is this dons intervention??
Tyeresse is screaming uhhhh nooooooo
What makes no sense about this video is that when Dom was pointing the gun at Shaw,everybody that was around the both of them showed no reaction but when he fired two bullets,now all of a sudden people were scared and started running away.
He&#39;s got about 2000 horses in that car...<br>Try 3000<br>Try 5<br>Doms cars must be over 10000 lbs to move that Bentley like that.
There&#39;s nothing more important than family
Cipher is excellent as a villain in the eighth chapter of The Fast Saga! Cipher will be in these two final movies 🍿🎥 as a villain or unless Cipher gets redeemed as antihero and will join Dom and his teammates, Hobbs and his teammates will have to deactivate and take down this mystery voice of David Eteon! David Eteon will be there in FX and it will be played by Keanu Reeves!
What a god awful movie, I&#39;m glad I stopped watching this is literal trash. Michael Bay level of absurdity.
Ridiculous
F&amp;F10 dom 5000 HP vs TANK
Fun fact: every horsepower his car has is one of his family’s in each universe
I know Dom&#39;s family now
All with the power of family
Fun scene.<br>We all know that this can not happen
The trash film 😂<br><br>Better old Version.
he&#39;s using NOS to drive backwards xd hahahahaha this movie is soo unbelievable stupid
Yeah okay, so there&#39;s just people walking on the sidewalk chilling not even looking
Dumbest movie series ever
Family
Try 3,000<br><br>Try 5<br><br>Shoot try 6..or 7 maybe..even 8 lol <br><br>More than enough cringe in these movies to go around when it comes to the writing 😂
AMG GTS my Fav😎
dom&#39;s charger got powered by family
surely the logic here is... box him in when he&#39;s surrounded, get out of the car then roll credits..?
Noo not the bentley 😂
That red Corvette
Dom&#39;s car powered by the Arc Reactor
Wait so the hooks to the door won&#39;t pull em off but all Torreto has to do is shoulder smash it and he send the whole truck flying........🤔
Dom gets trapped<br><b>Dom: Using a uno reverse card</b><br>Dom: You don’t harpoon me. I’m your family.
I loved the 5000hp scene.. like it doesn’t matter if the Dom’s car had a million.. it’s one 5000lb RWD w/12.5 tires vs FIVE 6000-20000lb RWD and AWD cars lol. Traction!!!!
Where&#39;s the airbags??
People should stop roasting hindi movies 🤣🤣
Extreme
RmlN
I Swear I Can&#39;t Stand These Movies. Even From The 1st One... It Looks Like They&#39;re All Gooing 100 MPH + Then It Shows Their Guages All At 60 80 MPH. Why Stop Doms Car In A Way Like That Anymay So Lame &amp; Stupid. I Wuld Have Saved Myself The Trouble With Sugar In The Tank. So Unrealistic Too Much Drama, Way To Much Over Acting &amp; Just Pitifully Stupid!
What a stupid movie.
Fun fact: Dom&#39;s dodge charger is powered by F A M I L Y<br>* Flashback to the fast five *<br>He&#39;s car is also F A M I L Y<br>Dragging the Vault
Filmed in Cleveland Ohio..love it
Qual velozes e furiosos esse ?
Remember when they&#39;re just about racing
Whack as hell
Fun Fact: Every Vin Diesel FF performance is not him acting but instead just him living his normal everyday life
It&#39;s like harpooning  on a big shark
Is this scene copied from hitman?
How many cabs were in the whole scene 😏
Dom car has more power
The more i saw hollywood popcorn movie like this, the more i feel stupid.
As stupid this scene seems after watching it 10 times i still don&#39;t see the end goal here. Like what are they doing stretching his car ? why cant you just get out of ur car and go to him in person.
😍😍😍
I thought this was a Salman Khan movie. I was not disappointed.
This proves that none of the cars can beat AMERICAN MUSCLE
I love how it looks like they are trying to capture a lion
Physics: “What the fuuu.....?!?”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=157">2:37</a> how tf is that door flying that far?? Let alone slamming into a 4 ton truck and pushing it back? 😂😂😂
My favorite scene of the whole series!!!
I&#39;ve stopped watching these now they are so unrealistic now it&#39;s not entertaining it&#39;s dumb
Family
After seing this, i really think, someone should start doing initial d movies or something.
Waiting for Slow and Tedious to come out
If paul walker came in it would of been the best blast in my Entire life dude,
This car doesn&#39;t obey the laws of physics at all!
they can try pop out the tires tho 🤣
Physics don&#39;t exist in this movie<br>Issac Newton: I&#39;m leaving this chat
Dom&#39;s car it&#39;s real beast gtx best car I ever seen great movie
“Gotta have about 2000 hp in that thing”<br>“Try 3000”<br>“Troi foive”<br>We all know it’s OVER 9000!!!!!!!
This is possibly the most realistic thing I&#39;ve ever see in my life.

Man busted off a whole door with just a shoulder thud @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=157">2:37</a>. Lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=115">1:55</a> When this shot showed up, I just walked out of the cinema. And I regretted I didn&#39;t right after the first scene... 🤢
5,000 horsepower 😂😂😂 on street tires 😂😂with NO supercharger 😂😂😂
Did this give anyone cars 2 flashbacks
Watching this scene reminded me of my childhood movie<br>Cars 2 hehe lol
One of the best clips
What a piece of shYt   ;) what happpened to that series is so dramatic :/
Roman i felt bad for him
Those car should’ve exploded
Fun fact: Dom&#39;s Plymouth was a dlc car in Forza 7 and was stated to have 2000hp
lol end<br><br><br>car
2000 hp and his old teammates rolling in stock vehicles no wonder it’s call “fate” and not fast.
The physics in this scene is insane🤯🤯🤯👌👌👌
This is where this movie became boring... Exerggeration and making Don appear super human....
Dom used the stolen VCR’s to build himself an Autobot.
In this scene,he was covered by his family,so......
bruh dey all doin burnouts das so🔥🔥🔥
The harmonious good-bye hisologically scream because date hypothetically scratch besides a numberless state. wooden, lyrical trout
😎
No wonder the call them muscle cars
His family soul are in him
Poor charger 🥲
everyone says how unlogical this is but its much possible side cars simply negate themselves and bentley helping domm to go forward by pulling him only back 2 veichles actually trapping domm and its pretty much possible to do
This was actually a cool scene
The way this scene plays out is exactly how I played with my toy cars.
HANDBRAKE SEEMS DOESN&#39;T EXISTS.
He/s gotta have about 2000hp in that thing.... try 3000...... try 5000..... car guys is it even possible to have that much hp in car with that engine size...

The fate of the furious
Name on netflix
God I love Bollywood
Why couldn&#39;t they just use that one gadget the police had in the first or second movie?
When family is on your side
This clip shows how bad the movie is
Thanos: I am inevitable <br>Dom: I have family<br>Thanos:........
And nobody aimed for tires 🤣
lmao this is insane man i cant even take this seriously as a car guy lmaooo jeez paul walker would be dissapointed
I love how The Rock has a beefy armored truck, but instead of t-boning dom and immobilizing his car, he just stops and shoots it with a harpoon
That charger must be made of manhole covers and powered by a alien super engine
idk why Dom was so shocked, like bro yall have done this before.
Jesus how much horse power that car have
It is so ridiculous that is is super awesome
I remember those old FF versions were logic was main matter
2021.11.02.KK.&lt;&gt;.
The fact the you saw dom and His reaction
dom: you thought this is going to be a street fight<br>me: <b>yes i thought it was going to be like that</b>
You know it’s really funny that the scene goes from badass to the cars getting smashed and crushed like plastic toys
Dom charger was different, its not looks like dodge charger in fast and furious 1 or 7 i think 🗿
এই মুভির নাম কি,,,,আর এই মুভির লিংক টা কেউ আমাকে দেন
Who misses Paul Walker?
Where is the hockey puck that kills the engine
Yeah sorry that charger that sounds like that doesn&#39;t have 5000hp and isn&#39;t pulling 6 cars ffs these movies make me sad.
I-Ready watch Fast and Furious 8
Family Meme: <b>Exists</b><br><br>Commenters: <b>Great opportunity to get attention and likes</b>
Just cause players:
2K HP<br>3K HP<br>4K BHP...
Imagine dom has no license
The solution to everything, more nitrous
Fun fact: Doms‘ car is available in Forza Motorsport 7 and in that game it actually has 2000hp, making it one of the most powerful cars in Forza history
That&#39;s my family
The cars would have still been pulling him back so he couldn’t have drove forwards into tej
He didn&#39;t even have to touch the door, he just looked at it wrong since it didn&#39;t have family.
Dom&#39;s car at the end of the scene: &quot;Heh... All that for a drop of blood.&quot;
try 2 thousand<br>try 3 thousand<br>try bugatti chiron
When you watch F&amp;F, throw PHYSICS in the garbage.
5 vs 1 win 1 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=84">1:24</a> Indian power 🇮🇳
in FF10: turns out Dom&#39;s car is a transformer and dom is the last Jedi
This is trash
2022
Dang they really be doing that to that nice charger
Hold on so you mean to telling me that doms car door was powerful enough to body a military truck😳
De lo más estúpido en estas películas 🤣🤣🤣
So dom has super strength to push out that car door?
The door scene is beyond stupid for so many reasons.
RIP Fast and furious.
2000bhp monster
Spierdalac mi z reklamami po minucie
Why AMG GT have clutch pedal 😂
👍❤️❤️❤️
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I get how the whole message is family, but notice how much better they are when fighting against their family?
Watch them miss with the harpoon and it just impales someone random.
Air bags saves lives
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=137">2:17</a>
What were they trying to accomplish by pulling away from all directions at the same time?
I don&#39;t know the context, but I feel like there are better ways to do what they&#39;re trying to achieve.
Dayum doms bumpers are Hella tough to keep staying on
Granny shifting not double clutching like you should. - dom
Me to Everyone in the comments..... IT&#39;S NOT A GODDAMN CHARGER... IT&#39;S A PLYMOUTH GTX.... Ohhhh for god&#39;s sake 😒🤦!!
Loki: I have an army.<br>Iron man: WE got the Hulk.<br>Dom: I have Family.
The family and the furious
This scene is so stupid and naive, total bollox 👎
V...I...T...R..I..N..E
gkhghkgh
Jesus died and rose 3 days later for our sins
Bro what’s up with that car 😂
Can somebody tell me when dom hits the nitrous why is he going on reverse lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=157">2:37</a><br><br><br>I am Groot!!
Yy
&quot;what if one of us smashes his radiator?&quot;<br>Someone who just watched Looney Tunes &quot;what if we set up an elaborate system of cables that harpoon his car and try to pull him in all directions to stop him?&quot;<br>Everyone else &quot;yeah I like that one better&quot;
La saga ya se hizo mierda con este tipo de escenas pendejas
I have been watch this Movie In 2017 My First Favourite Movie only this one But i see this before in TV But thats time I dont know Anything About Youtube thats time i dont Have any channel But i have now and I loved This Movie this Movie was the real Legends Movie Love From My Family and me ❤️❤️👨‍👩‍👦
Physics and Logic: <b>aight, we head out</b>
Next will be on the moon
At this point, Dom&#39;s car doesn&#39;t drink gas it breathes gas.<br>This car runs on several generations not family.
Watch the drag while dom is dragging her car
if you left the video and came to read the comments then you are a legend 👌🏼
Its a funny scene. Its sooo unreal.
This charger is powered by family
The look he gives when they keep harpooning his car haha O_O
Try 2khp    try 3khp try 5khp😂😂
Hahahah didn&#39;t know a door can push away a big suv like that
Lol even a pick up cant stand a change on a charger
I love when they said 5000 and 3000 5
Bruh they whole family they can stop dom
Meanwhile Thanos:They should have gone for head
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=126">2:06</a>
Movie name plize
Who&#39;s here because Spy Racers did the same thing in Season 5?
COMETINAIOZ
thats really &quot;hot wheels&quot; real life lmfao
At this point these movies are just special effects challenges. The plot died years ago.
Power of Dodge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=72">1:12</a> who is that man name again?
Fun fact: The rock is a woke joke.😂

So Dom just killed his Family.
even a awd car cant stop dom&#39;s 2wd charger
When will bollywood learn to make this types of movie&#39;s!!  i think not in this era
Dangerous 😲😲😲
Oh we love to see gear changes in an automatic 😖
FAMILY
Dumb people! Just shoot the fu*king tyres!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=122">2:02</a> There&#39;s literally F.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=51">0:51</a> I died with laughter
the directors/scriptwriters sniffing a whole barrel of white powder before directing any shots be like
Wtf
esto si es una buena pelicula no como la mierda que acaba de salir la 9
All the other cars are so useless LMAO😂😂😂
The Meg Guy though
So no one thought to spike the road or shoot the tires or did those not work because family
I dunno; last semester in Physics class they taught us about traction....
Who needs anything when you have family
Bruh
yes now my turn to press the red button!
Did dom really just shoulder check his door and it flew off!??!
These movies are so fuc...g stupid...
Simplesmente ele conseguiu derrubar um caminhão dando um soco na porta que a empurrou ksksk Lmao
O ho kya power hai
Newton is running for life after watching this
👍👍
What if romans line just went through dom😆
Where are the cops?
Bro I don&#39;t care how good of a driver he is that car shouldn&#39;t even be able to drive anymore.
The energetic sideboard biophysically miss because dredger parenthetically beg afore a miniature algeria. weary, possible currency
Should of boxed him in and that would of been it
People forget Dom didnt have Family power at this point as he was working for hacker lady.
Came here to make fun of the video, but there&#39;s nothing I can say that hasn&#39;t already been said.
Every I go I see Just Some Guy without a mustache everywhere...
Why nobody just shoot out his tyres?
abarttikca abartın amk
Where do I get a set of those Family brand tires?
Tires must&#39;ve been made out of gorilla glue rubber
I just realized he used the NOS in reverse. Heck probably could do it because of family, aye?
vin diesel you sucks...
Dom always use nitro
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=63">1:03</a> no one behind the wheel
The Gearbox :O<br>The Engine reving 2 minutes in the limiter :O<br>The door which can stand 2 cars pulling at them at full throttle :O
Fun fact: Dom’s car is powered by FAMILY
Damn this movie sucked.
എന്റെ mowneee power saaanam theeeyan theeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fact : all guys can shoot Dom&#39;s car tyre 😑
why are they all straining
His horse power is over 9000!
<b>First thing you see in the comments</b><br><br><br><br><b>“i gOt fAmILY”</b>
Family Is Important Thats why He Survived
How cute, playing tug of war with cars mi~
🤦‍♂️
There is no need to stretch him out like that, just bump his car from all side 😎
Dom look mad asl when they harpoon his ahh 😂
Dom&#39;s car is powered by FAMILY
garbage
LOL
They could&#39;ve just trapped him by ramming into him from all sides... like police officers do?
Nothing stronger than family
5000 hp..what r u smoking..
Family car 🙄🙄
And thats the power of family
Nothings stronger then doms car
Dom&#39;s charger is so powerful it started turning the other cars into Ghost Rider&#39;s new rides.
Anyone remember when these movies were about street racing?
Does anyone know that dom was driving a 1971 plymouth gtx not a charger
Plot twist: Dom is Superman&#39;s alter ego not Clark Kent
Who else loves the Silver Mercedes Benz AMG Gt r with the racing stripes driven by Tej?
:dom I don’t need harpoons….I got famliy….
That truck can literally pull a house and you’re telling me it couldn’t stop a car that’s 1/10th if it’s weight?
Rajnikant liked this scene
Why family was attacking Dom ?
Saga is slowly transforming to indian movies
The POWER OF family stone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=158">2:38</a> <br><br>That shoulder charge powered by Family!
So how are we gonna stop dom?<br><br>- road spikes<br>- road blocks<br>- getting 5 cars with grappling hooks surrounding and pulling him out
This scene is like 1 person v 5 people...<br>against the odds, still beats the crap out of the other 5 lol
So the movies are no longer about racing? It’s about a group of people turning into super hero’s
After this, family doesn’t like an actual family
Oi
Familia is stronger
&quot;Try two thousand&quot;<br>&quot;Try three thousand&quot;<br>&quot;Try Ninjago Rocket boosters&quot;
This dissent make sense Dom turns his back on family when the whole point of the franchise is not turning your back on family
This movie best comparing to f9
Family
What were the tires on Dom&#39;s charger made of, Infinity stones?
Vin diseil has a clause in his contract where he cant appear weak or lose a fight<br>But this is just ridiculous lmaoo
Movie has got so stupid I quit watching it on the 5th one
Why didn’t they just crash into him or something?
Newton beaten by <b>family</b>
They chose the most impractical cars to go after him, also no way one car can outyank 5.
Is this even drag racing movie anymore
they talk about horsepower<br><br>me: traction 👁️👄👁️

why would you attach a steel harpoon cable to the roof of the bentley? why would you ever attach something like that to anything other than the actual frame of the chasis?
Nobody can defeat dom cause he does everything for FAMILY
Physics, you’re fired.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=206">3:26</a> they had us on the first half, not gonna lie

Comon this is getting ridiculous
This is the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.
But lettys Corvette is damn..and that red on it
Movies get dumber every year. Total rubbish.
I can&#39;t keep a straight face when watching this, seriously, what the hell was that??? Hahahahahaahahhaa they&#39;re all just standing there like complete idiots, it looks like a child party or some power ranger bullshit 😂
Newton left the chat!
I didnt know we can do those moves with cars
Today furious 9 get over baby 🤩🤩
How about go for... the wheels?
God bless spread the gospel
Are all their tires made of Vibranium or something
They might have harpoons<br>But dom has family 😎
irl we would need freakin Ice tyres for any kind of grip there lol , even with 5k horsepower.
Hey! Physics called... It&#39;d like a word..
At this point he only has fam, cuz ily is missing.
5000 IQ right there
These movies are my guilty pleasure lol
I guess when ur the bad guy ur skill is increased by 75% but when dom stares at you and says family or a one liner then ur stats get lowered to negative 50%. Cuz last time I remember Shaw was unbeatable but now Shaw is just some regular lol of dude
you don&#39;t need logic when you have the family
I’ve never seen this movie, and after watching this I don’t think I ever will.
Family.
Remember: all of this is because Roman had his grapple on the top of his car.
family &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremely powerful cars
Their cars are powerful<br>But not as powerful as family
Why were they against Dom I never saw these trash movies
Haha 😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=147">2:27</a>

With all those harpoons they couldn&#39;t shoot his engine and disable it?
Is it even possible to have 5k ponies under the hood?
This whole saga turned into trash
Surprised that the cars aren’t just Transformers at this point
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=156">2:36</a> <br>Did Dom just casually  elbow check the door off of his car after Dwayne Johnsons massive truck couldn&#39;t pull it off?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=158">2:38</a> Your telling that when Dom it the door and hit hobb it knock the damn thing? Lol this is stupid family is overpowering Dom
I find it dumb they use expensive cars for this job

Damn, dom s barracuda has the strongest door hinges i ever saw if they can hold hobbs monster truck
Very cool scene even though it acts unrealistic

This was real dumb on Roman&#39;s part. You&#39;re trying to capture Touretto, and you choose your BENTLY for the job? He kind of deserved that for a decision that stupid.
Am I the only one watching this for that<br>“No No ItS MA BENTLEY”
Nothing is more important than family
The red car girl is So pretty I wanna be her gf
Dom&#39;s car is made of grade A Family.
So it is basically Loony Tunes.....
Am I the only one that wonders why Tyrese had that piece of crap Bentley? Lol
How many scientists we got in this comment section?<br>Comment section: Yes

Trust me DRIVER San Francisco felt as epic as this in the 2012s
When AAA needs road side assistance they call The Family.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=156">2:36</a> did my boi just shoulder off a car door
Great indian movie
I&#39;m safe its the family that matters
Does she have to be driving a classic corvette for this
You know what you can&#39;t harpoon down? <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Family
Dom cars is fuel with God&#39;s grace.
🤑
Doms horsepower: 5,000<br> <br><br>DOMS HAND HORSEPIWER: 500,000
The axle getting ripped is the most realistic thing here
The fact that Letty told Tej about the line snap is so dumb like literally Tej is the smartest one of the crew
This seen somehow seems less realistic then the Nuclear reactor car from ‘Madagascar 3’
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=154">2:34</a><br>Is this the hulk or FnF?
Dom sure loves B bodies in all his movies
&quot;Family Is Everything&quot;
why did they harpoon doms car?
Pretty sure that car is made out of vibranium
What&#39;s the point of having nice cars if they are gonna bust them up.
Is this Tollywood or Hollywood I&#39;m confused 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
After watching this me:<br>Koi sense hai iss baat ka
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=147">2:27</a> half life scientist sound
Good God this is so stupid
Películas aburridas
Nobody thought to get out if the car and grab him while he was harpooned lmao these movies blow but it made me laugh
Dom is an alien
Thats not how tire grip works....but ok. I&#39;m mature enough to understand its a movie😂 it does look pretty cool.
That poor GTX!!!!
Is this the actors trying to stop Vin from making another Fast movie? ITS NOT GOING TO WORK!
Dom should know you cant escape from family....
Dom has 2,000 hp in that GTX, and he needs nitrous to speed away from a 400-500 hp corvette? Also, I&#39;m getting tired of seeing Dom trashing old muscle cars. It&#39;s like, let me bring my very rare Challenger R/T 426 convertible when I&#39;m going to be crashing into things and getting shot at.
Dom’s using cheat code “Family”

How strong are them hooks
When ure stronger than family
Yearh, I don’t know, Rick…
Avengers trying to take the infinity stone from thanos.
Im here just for the comment
Is dom turning back on family?
The people who wrote this just assume noone understands cars. Or horsepower. Or grip. Or basic physics.
The only reason Don was able to take them all on was he trusted family while they didn&#39;t.
ALL YOU NEED IS FAMILY...<br><br>ughhh, Scientists are so DUMB 🙉
His car is trying to get away from us, quick harpoon the front and pull him away from us.
This car was stronger than family
Or they could’ve y’know… shot and disabled his engine
Physics has left the Theatre.
😁🐛
At this point I wouldn&#39;t even be surprised anymore if they say that dom is actually an alien
I still can’t believe that this was made 3 years ago…
Epic bullshit
I dont have friends.... I have FAMILY
Elon Musk - 5,000 BHP, Whats Your car Running On ?<br>Dom - Family
Family.
Fast and ridiculous
Que wea más mala!!!!!!!
Plot armor in these movies are insane !!!<br><br>Even han is back in the next one 😂😂😂
Try 3<br>Try 4<br>Try 5 <br><br>I like how they keep saying that their cars have this much HP as if it&#39;s normal <br><br>And here in the real world a bugatti divo has 1600 HP😂😂
The memes this movie created are unbelievable
So like… is everyone in the background just not calling the police?
family.
Ah yes, enough power to play tug of war with 5 different vehicles which includes 2 supercars and a truck. This is ridiculous, even by my standards.
My Charger broke down after 30 thousand miles, how did he get one that can withstand a bunch of harpoons

Only Dom can attack family and protect  family at the same time😂😂
Impala from Supernatural: Finally, a worthy opponent!
This is why I stopped bothering to watch these.
To be fair they were all in reverse.
You dont need horsepower when you got FAMILY
Who wins? Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet and all the Avengers or Dom powered by Family.
Why did he do this again I forgot

family is everything
The Rock’s vehicle is all that is needed.
Horsepower? Try FAMILYPOWER.
How ridiculous. Not even entertaining. 0/10
Jeez
Try infinity
So anyways I was on my way to work and you never guess what happeened at the intersection.. no for real, you will never guess.
Peak stupidity
So a huge car can&#39;t pull off a door but him shoving it does😐 makes sense
Can&#39;t wait for Fast and Furious 11. Rumor has it that&#39;s when &quot;The Family&quot; will collide with the MCU and DC universes simultaneously and fight off the Stormtroopers while hijacking spaceships in another universe.
the tires had family or else they’d be reduced to atoms

Мне одному интересно что они хотели сделать?
These movies need to stop. I get it. You&#39;re a man. You like cars. The story to this should&#39;ve ended after Walker and that one with the sad ending. Like. Stop it. Please. You guys can find other roles stop feeding into this franchise. Please. No hate just please stahp.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G76ThtqLvWk&amp;t=155">2:35</a> I never noticed before but Dom like... elbows his car door off? LOL
Well, they could&#39;ve just sorround him with  armored cars - or even heavy police cars - so that he couldn&#39;t drive away... But that would be too easy, I guess 🙃
If dom has family then why doesnt he ride a family car?
Diesel&#39;s 4th law of motion: When you&#39;ve got family; you don&#39;t need the other three.
So when they’re all surrounding him... why not just ram him from all sides to box him in instead of trying to “stretch him out”?
