Times when Batista left working out

They couldn’t come up with a better name than Brass Body? Like anything would be better than that. Even Metal Body would be better than brass lol
I really thought he was going to be set on fire
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=17">0:17</a> this is meme
Pure dex vs pure strength
If only Batista had been cast to play Conan!!!
Batista wwe
The Asian dude fighting Batista could literally play gutz.
ТОЗИ ФИЛМ Е МНОГО ДОБЪР ДАВАМ МУ 10 ОТ 10
Jak zbožnuju Davea Bautistu,přeji mu hlavně hodně zdravíčka💞

Bond Henchman Mr. Hinx vs Bond Henchman Yao
Rickden = Why won&#39;t you DIE ? ? ?<br><br>Sen Batista = WWE SON !
Как нозиваеться фильм ? Плис.
Как называется фильм?
loved this movie so much dave bautista did so good he was a monster till he got defeated
Keeeee blade
How the heck did this movie get Russell crowe 🤣
Before Drax joined the Guardians......
The action scenes were great but the story made no sense
Dave Dave Dave hurry up
A man whose body is essentially immune to blades versus someone who relies completely on blades to kill; he should have just ran.
Get em boy🕹🥋
Next
Oscar ability
Cuando drax el destructor era iron fist
batistabomb
..golden haki..
X Blade: aggressively hitting.<br>Drax: HURTS....... I have sensitive nipples.
Nice vidieo
Nanomachines son
This is the real iron fist
Man, Batista needs to make more bad guy roles like this one
Copy that our history
Brasstista
Whatever Brass Body go fetch my car
Man marvel really buffed drax he can turn into brass man
he is using airbag sensors
In India karna will remember
This movie was freaking great but the second one was 50/50 for me<br><br>I should def rewatch both movies. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve seen them.
Man Of Brass, not of Steel, like Superman.😤
Rza accidently made colossus.
The music in this scene made it twice as good!
Qual er o nome desse filme
Lord friza
Brass boi vs Wimp with knives
Now ik why they chose him as drax or how ever u call him
If he&#39;s iron fist then What&#39;s about his wife🙄🙄
Ok but u see it as golden body not iron
This was a better mortal combat movie than the one we just got.
Njay, kyk real ni film pada zaman nya 😀👍👍👍
What is this the legend of Zelda why so many pots.
Thank god I didn’t see this god awful movie back in 2012 I hate movies where like this were the guy can’t be hurt absolute rubbish
They might as well add him into MK11🤣
So i see johnny tran just gave up racing
Wolverine vs Colossus...
Wow that&#39;s some bad cgi... 😂😂
So Batista wins again ig
Whenever the veggie eaters hate bamby eaters
all these years and nobody commented on how brass body BATISTA BOMBED A GUY TO DEATH
Its late but the movie good?
heyyy it&#39;s the guy from Fast and Furious
When Indians get into hollywood
I love the God of War fight music
I never thought batista is xmen
This looks dope
Who ripped the kids throat. Dude must have been moving so slow I couldn&#39;t see him
Drax!
wow basista is so cool they made him into a real thing
Johnny Tran
I actually love this movie
This only makes me realise the wasted potential Drax had.
&quot;That wrestler disrespected my family,  I had Feds in my house&quot;...
Bane!
man like dave batista uno
The truth is... I am Brass Man!
if only this is the bautista who fought zeus
Legend has it drax is in this video before he came q destroyer....but he must&#39;ve stood still the entire video😫
Is that Draxx? From gotg
“Iron hands vs golden batista”.
Where to watch more
Batista bomb XD
I love how right at the start x-blade does two big kicks to his chest and Brass barely even moves with a &#39;really?&#39; look on his face
Gotta love literal plot armor.
Dude, I bet he&#39;s got more that a 100 grand under the hood of that car
He should play Doc Savage
the gym teacher when they join your team:
Ah.  The new Mortal Kombat protagonist stole his powers from this guy.  This scene is way better then anything from mk2021 though.
Johnny tran got worked over pretty good 😆
Batista would&#39;ve took them hits either way he dont need to act like it didn&#39;t hurt bc it didn&#39;t lmao
nothing like a fair fight
Its one of Cole Youngs ancestors
did he die?
Why you gotta do Jin so dirty Drax?
I&#39;m the only one who thought of this while watching MK 2021
When you try to kill the rammus late game as ad assasins
Drax, is that you?
&quot;Dave Batista,&quot; Masive!!
Wtf is this.... and how have i not heard about it
It&#39;s golden colossus s solo movie
this was supposed to be an action comedy right lol
Batista bomb
I was wondering why the dude looked so similar to Drax when he became bronze. now I know why
Marvel saw this film and knew he&#39;d be a perfect Drax. They were right.
Bautista is perfect for Sparky Sparky Boom Man
that color of haki 🤣🤣🤣
Oh, the innocent crockery...
Why&#39;s this movie framed so horribly?
batista bumbum
cole young copied the swag
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=98">1:38</a> SHIRT RIPPER
drax is in every movie sometimes we can see him and sometimes he stands so incredibly still we can&#39;t see him
F
Those people dont know the first rule of the dark souls... if you cant hurt the boss just fucing run
That’s how we starting? Sheeeeeeeeeeesh
Brass Draxx is <b>Braxx.</b>
kala ko si gloc 9 yung nasa thumbnail ampota
The best thing to come from this is the rest of Bautista&#39;s career afterward.
gotta love the valve stock metal clang sounds
Dude smile like he is waiting to get fk
this is so stupid i love it
چش
Is he even the bad guy? That what only kid says lol
hes got civics with spoon engines
HI
what is wrong with the blood sprut
Drax means business
damn batista
batista vs collosus
take a shot everytime theres a whoosh and a whip sound effect.
Only run away!
i start remember when drax said he can take iron man shot i think he can
Haki vũ trang cấp cao ah

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=23">0:23</a> the joke didn&#39;t go over his head
this should be dubbed the brazen animal brassista
Garbage movie
Its batista
¡Tank power!
THANOSSSSS!
He just Rambo&#39;d his neck lmao
C3PO really committed to a glowup, damn
<b>context</b>
Chinese action movies really are something else
10 years ago, if you&#39;d told me that Dave Batista was gonna be one of Hollywood&#39;s most recognizable action star, I&#39;d have asked who sold you your weed.<br><br>I&#39;m glad I was wrong.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=26">0:26</a> mans just got an irl wall bounce combo lol
So he is like a tackier colossus
Looks like devil fruit powers
WHY IS GAMORA??!
His head looks like golden experience
Ultimate example of rock vs scissors
Bautista yata yan diba
Good man or iron man
I&#39;m gonna tell my kids that this was iron man
fun fact: that brass colored skin that appears from time to time is actually batista.
i like how he just ripped his throat out and it had a fog of blood that came out
How tf bautista has haki?
I feel like davs batistas only direction was to let them punch you a few times then slam the stunt doubles into some stuff
It&#39;s white luke cage
Well rocket was lying. <br>“His kind takes everything literal.”<br>He literally wasn’t lying when he said he would kill his son
Man I loved this movie so much I&#39;m gonna watch it
Is that a terminator?
Upon quickly sawing the thumbnail, i though this was a very elaborate cosplay of DIO&#39;s The World
I can&#39;t decide if I want to make a GotG joke or a Metal Gear Rising joke... this is tough, man.
WHY IS GAMORA
Shh, no one tell the writers how much softer than steel brass is
I hated this movie then and I hate it  now
Hey , triple h come see it&#39;s him &quot;Batista&quot;
What&#39;s the idea behind Brass Body&#39;s ability? Why brass in particular?
Warframe Rhino
so he becomes on of the weakest meltals in history but yet nobody can break him yet wait till hulk hears about this lol
Is this the cheap version of cyclops?
Brutal
Armstrong in real life.
Фильм как называется
Blades vs metal dosent go all that well for the blade
Armament haki is somethin else.
yo this video is sick
@ no point during this pretty ridiculous movie did I ever think he was going to become one of my favorite actors 2 years later, but you did Dave you did.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=29">0:29</a> MY GOD, ITS THE BATISTA BOMB!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=3">0:03</a> Hmmm I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve heard that sound before somewhere
Who were they fighting? I couldn&#39;t see the man they were all fighting...
Dude look like golden freeza from dragon ball
Fun fact, there were no special effects in this scene. That&#39;s just standard Bautista stuff.
The first I see of this movie is Batista ripping a kids throat out. Rad.
I wish they can’t see the big guy. Why? “Drax” gonna tell you everything.😏
Учился у Гордона кадыки вырывать?
<b>weapons wont work against him</b><br>Maybe I&#39;ll try hand...
Wtf he becomes a dundie?
Как называется фильм?
this movie sucks
He was like, having the armament haki.. 🤣 😂
សុំ
I really want to make a Jojo&#39;s reference
sorry its a dumb movie when you make someone that op and they still try and fight
Batista is half american half filipino right?
Every second of this movie feels like satire
Ahh yes another day another weird youtube recommendation.
Why is nobody else talking about MCJin
Drax?
Munculkan film ini yg satu jam knp film selalu pendek
Can we just say how bad this movie was😂
I think the name film is hall of judge
Brass body character is <br>Wwe wrestlers Batista <br>I think.
Draxx !! is that you ?
I know it its batista the wwe wrestler thats why
I think i know this guy with the iron fists
В целом всё понятно, но у меня остался один вопрос: что там делают все эти 10000 глиняных горшков?
Johnny Trans vs Drax
H uyjjcnr
Is this drax from guardians of the galaxy
I never narc&#39;d on nobody!
Brass Body?<br>That&#39;s Batista with his Batista tattoos doing Batista Bombs
All those pots. Link would be proud
&quot;no weapons seem to hurt this guy let me punch him with my unprotected fist and try to fight him hand to hand&quot;
So this is where they got the idea of luke cage Netflix series
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄👍
Copy from Luke cage
,,,Drax?
what its batista
johnny tran lookin different here
Without his V-tec he is nothing
Too much zoom in close up.
he had gold on his chest
I&#39;ll do you one better! Why is Gamora?
Yellow drax
Железная рубашка))) я смотрел, я позже посмотрю версию квентина
Batista movie so nice

X-blade &amp; friends: *throws shurikens and saw the enemy has literally impenetrable skin<br>*Proceeds in close-quarter combat
Lol,he is MC Jin
Wow batista
Use thunder since he is made of iron. Crazy to fight without tactics and strategy.
This movie had so much wasted potential
Phantom Troupe vs Meruem in a nutshell
Batista on WWE
Woah 😲 he has an armament haki
NANOMACHINES, SON!
This movie was hard af
I want him to be bane for the DC Movies
See ! Drax may not be invisible but he is invincible 😉😉😁
After the weapon breaking why punch him loll????
Dana White kah?
Nanomachines son.
Rip hippop man
Drax?
love how they had the batista bomb 😂
Si fue malo la do wwe aquí es un asco
Haki
This guy is had a paramecia power devil fruit.
reminds me of tessai from ninja scroll
Can we PLEASE say a few words about how Zen-Yi&#39;s boy was Ride or Die to the very end???  <br><br>Respect.
<b>Johnny Tran Meets Luke Hobbs</b>
So he like Armstrong?
Guy that can take blades, punches, water, kicks and has super strength: &quot;Oh no, a small roof, you totally got me now, oh no&quot;.
He has a devil fruit
Like honestly wrestlers should just stay in these roles. Its where they&#39;re best
Trap him, apply heat, shiny new door knobs for all the homes in the area.
Proof of haki
Я этот фильм сейчас по ноутбуку смотрю, а тут реклама в Андроиде вышла ))) Фантастика прям )))  Называется : Железный кулак (2012 года)
So basically he’s the armored titan...or has armament haki got it
<b>Sees his throat ripped</b> dang! that was horrible &amp; violent. <br><br>He should have ripped his jaw out, to make even better &amp; with moar violence
Nanomachines son!
Mood
Dead vs The evil nephew from karate kid
Thank goodness Peter Rasputin is a teddy bear at heart. Amirite?
So David Batista is gonna be the live action sparky sparky boom man right
Why are all of you making jokes abot this child murder killing spree movie
Why does the brass spark and not scratch when hit with hardened steel? <br><br>Brass is pretty soft comparatively
Is this the comedy?
Link would be jealous
:o
Lol...fake Colossus...but gold!
In the wise words of TFS Vegeta: wow what a rip off!
so basically he&#39;s Colossus, but evil.
Dave &#39;Brass&#39;tusta ,huh
Dam, spikes doesn&#39;t work. .<br><b>throws water</b>
Looks like the Armored Titan just sayin 😂
And thats the first armament haki user Batistaa!!!
This movie was so bad lol
Uhh hello?? What are they fighting against??? Literally just 3 adult Asian males flying around for 2 minutes.
Ah batista
So a hedgehog versus deax, amazing
That one guy just broke his sword on his head and exposed the brass. Why in the world would he punch him after that???
Fouseytube when boxing:0:38
dislikes are from t seris
I started taking Bautista seriously as an actor once I saw his short film he did for Blade runner.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=31">0:31</a> Bautista bomb.
I don&#39;t know what I just watched but I&#39;m sure is the worst  shity movie ever created
This reminds me of Haki one piece
Who are  they fighting against ?
i&#39;m still wondering how he got tatooed
Without context it looks like xblade is the good guy
Yeah, use piercing and slashing weapons against armor.😐
The guy batista is fighting the one that try the knifes is the same guy that played the robot samurai in robocop 3
Best character in the movie so dumb how he lost to the blacksmith. But its the blacksmiths movie so it had to happen
Is this Za Warudo?
Oh wow. I forgot Batista was in this movie. Now it makes sense why they asked him to be in guardian of the galaxy. He is great.
Now...that.....is.....acting!
When Jhonny Tran was pissed because Drax stole his bike
sorry but he&#39;s forever Drax.  nothing can change that now.
If he turns to brass if something harms him then how did he get his tatoos
This movie was awful
I wonder what killed them because I saw nothing..
OH YEAH MY PARENTS KANE KEKE REMEMBER THIS MOVIE ACTION PACK
and he did the batista bomb on here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=124">2:04</a> <b>SHIZAAAAAA...!!!</b>
*Everything else&#39;s fine, but how the hell did Drax change his colour?Man!
Hollywood and Bollywood are doing their part to keep the clay pots industry booming in the 21st century.
its like haki
Wait hold I just noticed was that Jin the Asian rapper who neck he ripped?
Is that mcjin at the start lol damn the algorithm
Nanomachines, son!
Was that Jin in the beginning? The irony of an MC getting his vocals destroyed. Get it? His vocals....?
trying to punch when sword fails to damage!
You can infact turn your body into iron but it will take 20 years . It is in ancient tibetan script

Communist china makes terrible movies... But alot of production value..
Idk why but he&#39;s a perfect combustion man cast
Could have played collossus in xmen. Thats how he shouldve been able change to himan form. Just needed to work on the accent
А на нашем как называется филм то.

This is the Godfist LeeSin skin that I want.
Why is X blade?

Op batista, draxx
Still dope

Never wouldve fought him. Nope
My 10 year old self vs my abusive step father
Bautista bomb😂
Y&#39;all talking about drax and i couldn&#39;t even see him.smh
Of all the wrestlers I expected batista to be the last one to have a successful acting career. It&#39;s funny how he&#39;s better than John Cena

Wait his body turns to brass when he’s attacked. But they hit him with a steel blade. Steel is harder than brass but it broke. But some how Iron Hands was able to smash him into pieces. I don’t get it.
Isn&#39;t brass a pretty soft metal?
The original &quot;Nanomachines , son! &quot;

I belive that dude have a sensitive nipple

Watching that man punch a person whose skin was just shown to be hard enough to break his blade... might be the stupidest decision I&#39;ve ever seen a character make.
That was the fastest strip I ever seen.

I&#39;m gonna be honest with you chief, brass is strong than copper but it ain&#39;t stronger than steel.

Gold Draxx
Anyone else catch Frozen 2&#39;s &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; vibes from this music several times?
he may have iron skin like  Colossus from X-Men but I feel this takes inspiration from  Tessai the stone skin ninja of  The eight demons of  Kimon  from &#39;Ninja Scroll&#39;

Absorbing man be like:
who are they fighting i don&#39;t see anyone
I want to point out that Dave Bautista said they could get a good shot of the slow-mo punch. So he told the actor to just do it for real. That&#39;s why that scene looks so cool.
Hes Batista
He&#39;s strong 💪 like hulk
Batista<br>wwe
You can&#39;t hurt me Jack! Armstrong quote 🤣🤣🤣

Looks like drax was an assasin before his lost
Where is brass body, I only saw people flying around and get hurt by something I can’t see.
Drax is that you?
X-Men Colossus be d**ned.
garbage lol
He killed Jin the Mc at the beginning. Lol
That sounds fit perfectly for this golden guy how his walking
Let&#39;s see him fight Luke Cage.
Should&#39;ve used a Magnet

For some reason, I can’t see Brass Body? (only some will get the reference)
Yeah that&#39;s go fight a man made of metal in hand-to-hand combat what can possibly go wrong
Horrible editing.
now he also master invisibility
If Drax had  brass&#39;s iron body, he would totally become invisible by standing still, everybody gonna think he&#39;s just a statue
&quot;Tekkai!!&quot; yall dont know wassup
Played college ball, ya know.
Brass body uses hung gar style Kung fu
Kind of a 1 sided fight...

Makes me think, Brass Body should have been in the MCU instead.
That&#39;s how strong and powerful Drax really is supposed to be, but like all powerhouses in the MCU are nerfed.
That asian guy sure has aloy of knives on his body.<br>And Batistas body tho, dam.
Please download link give me this movie.
It&#39;s like if the T800 went back to old time japan

Atlas i found you
“Hey, we just watch our buddy, Sam just try to throw knives and this guy and it didn’t work”<br><br><br><br><b>”I’m gonna punch him”</b>
The yellow guy is like collosus from x men
This is the true inspiration for golden frieza
Link would be proud of Draxx collecting all those rupees

Який треш.

I guess this is drax In another universe
&quot;too soon junior&quot;
Wait... Isn&#39;t he Drax???
Dave really knows how to play villians, he&#39;s an amazing actor I think he would at least get an Oscar nomination if he got a major dramatic role
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9V0oDrPfs&amp;t=38">0:38</a> He thought he was invisible, so he decided not to move

I wonder if they got the idea for brass body from Tessai in the ninja scroll movie?
But how did the tattoo needle penetrate its body
That power bomb sent that man to heaven
Antagonist&#39;s worst mistake - Hit your opponent too far away<br>Why can&#39;t you just hold onto your opponent and punch him till he dies?
Hi Drax!
Why is this in my recommendations?
<b>Kid With The Golden Arm</b>
Who else came here and thought it was marvel
“I’m not a dude, you’re a dude...”

Batista with Armament Haki.
It is what happens when you give Drax an iron man suit.

Brass Body, Batista, Drax lmaoooo
I&#39;ll do one better, why is gamora?
No one can beat DRAX THE DESTROYER!!!
man how did I miss this movie? I think I will have to watch.
Asian Colossus
Drax when he&#39;s not invisible
this cgi takes me back to 1970
This was only just borderline ok. The second was unwatchable garbage.
He is cheating
it should of been equalizer vs john wick
Haki
nanomachines, son!!
I was so looking forward to this movie, but really disappointed when I saw it. Sure, it has loads of action but I can&#39;t put my finger on why it was disappointing.
My life is a lie I thought it was a gold body but instead it&#39;s brass, gold would be much better
Bautista nailed it😍
Brolytista
Golden frieza?!
Movie clips PIN this if you love your subscribers!
I watched this movie a long time ago, but the only thing i remember is a fat Russell crowe.
Golden Frieza looks great
Hallooooo draxx

ARMAMENT HAKI
<b>Brass Body.... .Does it mean Dave got a BRASS NIPPLE and TESTICLES!?</b>
This movie was directed by RZA, a member of the &#39;Wutang Clan&#39; rap group with Method Man and others in the 90&#39;s. He love old 70&#39;s martial arts films, and this is his love letter to those films.
Why is gamora ??
Drift King vs Drax
The film is ok but the lead actor is garbage ...he is so full of himself...
Whats with the background music? Is this movie from 1970?
David Michael Bautista’s FIRST Major Theatrical Motion Picture. The Year was 2012
Drax can become a human &amp; change his skin colour to golden. He is a humble chameleon with the power to stand so still that he becomes invisible.
Wtf i just saw
