This movie is Thor Ragnarok in the in F&amp;Fverse 😅
I like how they ripped the cab off of a semi and placed it on a sick looking car
NITROUS!

Does anyone feel bad for the pilot when he got thrown out the helicopter😢
Ah yes the trucks we need in forza horizon 5
No Trucks And Helicopters who were harmed in this film!
I love the buildup of the fear of them about to get lifted in the air to the sudden arrival of the brothers all tinkering with their controls to the beat of the music. Couldn&#39;t have created a &quot;the playing feel is levelled now Brixton, we&#39;re coming for you!!!&quot; vibe any better. Gets me pumped every time I hear &quot;we&#39;re coming uso!!!&quot;.
Jason Statham is awesome and he has lots of skills to defeat bad guys!
In this clip roman is not the tribal chief😂
Klife Diesel
Imagine Jimmy, Jey, and Solo in this movie.
Funny how the helicopter couldn&#39;t simply lift the tiny truck and fly off
Dumbest movie and dumbest scene LOLOL
Bro was laughing until hob&#39;s bro clicked nos

Huh. Didn&#39;t know Optimus guest-starred in this film.
Прекрасная сказка
Que buena cadena, aguanta tanta presión que pienso a de ser de Adamantium o de vibranium😂
Oh I call BS! That blackhawk can lift 9,000lbs. It sure as hell would lift that car off the ground
bullshit
What if they accelerate the helicopter so that the vehicles lose strength and balance?
Wow, this scene has like ALL the bullshit. haha
I can&#39;t believe they did my man Optimus like that.
Is this a true story?
relly!!! they can hear each other?

You could&#39;ve called Captain America. He will catch the helicopter with his bare hands
The pilot didn&#39;t listened to helikopter hard enough and didn&#39;t have enough para kofer power  so he lost. Classic.

I am straight out speechless. what did I just see?
Terrible nonsense.. I don&#39;t understand how someone can be so blinded and believe it 🤮🤮
To think Brixton could have just fired the chopper&#39;s weapons before the other trucks came in and blown Hobbs and Shaw up.<br><br>This is an F&amp;F movie,no one ever gets hurt by their own explosives.
Physics has left the chat
Dwayne Johnson (hobbs): i need a distraction<br>Roman Reigns: Uh-Ah  (and give the villain the spear
This is literally one of the 3 only scenes in this movie that actually gives fast and furious vibes to it
This was exactly what I wanted to do as a kid
Haha...so genial
；；ｌｌｋ
Never has such garbage been put on film
I expected mom to show up last and attach car to the others.
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!!!
This would actually be a great clip to analyze in a Physics class
Imagine that there was a room with moviewriters, brainstorming about this movie and someone came up with this scene and proposed it to the other writers
This is like the Gi Joe Comic only someone filmed it without the license.
Considering the fact that in reality several things will happen like the chain breaking, Blackhawks are not Chinooks they dont have that lifting power to pull 4/5 trucks, Hollywood juz love to use NOS as jet pack booster for vehicles. Still this scene is awesome......hahaha
And a friend of mine said that FF is realistic
Those are the all mighty truck and rescue trucks
I like the all mighty truck and rescue trucks
This is the easiest way to teach kids Toretto and Hobbs&#39; Law of Physics, show them this movie + the FF franchise.
Fun Fact: ur mom was in the car so it was too heavy to lift

I know NOS works absolutely nothing like this, but ngl that was fun to watch
I&#39;ve seen the behind the scenes of this and the only thing thats not real is the big chain on the helicopter and the truck hobbs and shaw is riding..<br>The car chain were real! it&#39;s really cool!!
FORM THE MEGAZORD!!!
I swear this is the best ff scene
Um helicóptero  desses e ainda armado , so em filmes mesmo  uma situação dessas .
Most beautiful truck ever it looks like hot wheels.
Ah fast and furious the call of duty of movies
Stupid muvie
I&#39;ve seen this movie b4 when I was a kid. I didn&#39;t know Roman Reigns is but now I know
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=177">2:57</a> is a great quote:”hit it with the moonshine
That gun pod would get ripped off the chopper from holding all those trucks
Что за глупость?
I&#39;m so glad I never watched this 😂😂 that&#39;s some powerful NOS giving that AWD vehicle mega front wheel traction 😂😂😂😂😂
Cartoons
A &quot;movie&quot; for idiots. <br>Guwno.
Каким же безмозглым нужно быть чтобы такое придумать?

Боже, это такой бред.
Как человек, который учится на физмат потоке заявляю, всё это хуйня

Jeez, never watched this move, no wonder why. What a bs scene

Just because you&#39;re fast doesn&#39;t mean you have infinite friction<br><br>Haha NOS goes brrrrrrr
This is the reason I don&#39;t go to the movies anymore

Какая уйнëвая уйня.
This is pretty much the same as when they take down the plane so just remaking scenes
no thanks
Just so we are clear, we all know that helicopter can lift that approx 6000 lbs of truck right?  Right?
There is no way a black hawk could do all this. If you are going to do these sort of stunts, at least use a helicopter that could probably do it. This reminds me of that harrier scene in True Lies.
In reality, had the helicopter been in attack mode, bye bye Hobbs and Shaw. Movies is magic.
A Blackhawk can lift about 9,000 pounds. All the weapons on that one are taking up a significant portion of that weight. Under ideal conditions, it might be able to get one end of one truck slightly off the ground. There&#39;s no possible way it would be able to lift several trucks at once.<br><br>Also, the &quot;hit &#39;em with the moonshine&quot; bit... just no. For one thing, if your tires already have limited traction, spinning them faster is going to do nothing but kick up dust. More speed means nothing if the traction isn&#39;t there. Second, two tires on the ground wouldn&#39;t be able to pull four trucks and a helicopter around that corner, even on pavement. All four trucks 100% would have gone over that cliff (assuming the helicopter could even lift them in the first place). Contrary to popular belief, nitrous is not magic.<br><br>I know I&#39;m being a buzzkill here, but it&#39;s pretty hard to suspend disbelief for scenes like this. I wish I could turn off my brain.

this scene reminds me alot of the scene where dom and the gang stole a bunch of fuel tanks from a long fuel truck
this seems really stupid, why do ppl watch these?
Fast and Furious franchise always putted amazing taste vehicles &lt;3 except the 1st 2nd and 3rd one those were ricers level except doms ones are pure gold &lt;3
Is it just me, or that car is autobot impostor?
É muita mentira em uma única sena.
&quot;He wasn&#39;t breathing hard enough after pulling the chain back to the crank, WHICH, BTW is another 27.8 sins added🤓.&quot; -CinemaSins probably.

Guys you gotta realize, we can&#39;t have fun scenes and movies like this if all movies were made 100% realistic.
der blanke Dünnschiss !!!!
A 6 year old director?
Despite this movie and all the recent ones were out of tune from racing and the originals, when he hit that moonshine for a second it felt like the good old Fast and Furios movies
They need to nerf that moonshine
That truck is cool as fu k though
Science-fiction
I wonder how Romain rain felt
This how it feels playing just cause 4 lmao

Brixton&#39;s laugh at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=165">2:45</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=86">1:26</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=88">1:28</a>
Brixton is like where is that chain gonna go 7 seconds
These rigs hella dope 4x4 action🔥
Mükemmel her seriyi heycanla izliyorum 👍
It ain&#39;t a Fast &amp; Furious movie without tricked out cars.
Боливуд отдыхает...
Ну нихера себе, это как так, закинуть цепь весом 40-50кг на 20 метров?🤣🤣🤣
I can&#39;t wait the next film and Dom&#39;s family colab with Hobbs&#39;s family
I&#39;m more than happy to ignore the particular masses and thrusts, as well as the fact that Brixton only seems to pull up harder when each truck is added. It makes for an enjoyable watch.<br><br>However... That part (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=170">2:50</a>) where Brixton tries to pull them off the edge... If there&#39;s too much weight for him to lift them up, what&#39;s pulling them off the road going to do, other than crash the heli? xD<br>(I guess <i>maybe</i> he wasn&#39;t trying to pull them off, but to disconnect the trucks, perhaps, or get one of the chain to panic and disconnect, but it&#39;s a huge risk given, if nothing else, they might not <i>be</i> able to disconnect the trucks! :P)
Helicopter could barely hold itself against one truck, then all the sudden it&#39;s lifting three?
The car vs helicopter is pvp but is shet xd

Is this movie considered science fiction? Cause it sure as hell is far from reality.
Pathetic movie but so is the franchise I suppose
يفضح  عرضكم ما اكذبكم
Такой бред.
Bye bye vin diesel fast and furious welcome hobbs and shaw
Seems i fall asleep on this scene
The fact that Hobbes brothers were doing this in thongs show how that are real Samoans like me🥰
Im not fan of these FF movies since tokyo drift. But damn this looks fun.<br><br>Edit: watched movie and action scenes was so ridiculousny&#39;s absurd thats why i loved it :D haha
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=35">00:35</a> he&#39;s talking like sonic
Remember when Vin Diesel and crew said FF6 was going to be the last film they made out of respect for Paul Walker passing away? Me too.
-Pull up!<br>-I can&#39;t, we are chained to a car. <br>-Hey, they are adding another car to this chain thing!<br>-Ok, let&#39;t pull up just a bit.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=177">2:57</a> ngl this bit was sick
Physics: dame dame
I swear the third brother (last one to attach to the cars) is my favourite because of how enthusiastic and giggly he is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=117">1:57</a> was that really a necessary shot? 😂🙄
For a moment I thought it was a towing hot rod
It’s amazing how the guy in the front vehicle heard the rock all the way from the back when told to switch the nitro’s on
I doubt the rock heard Jason talk and vice versa
I don&#39;t know why Hobbs is calling Maui ooso 😂
This movie is literally 9 year old me playing with my Lego City sets.
Really that big chopper lifts an big tractor
It&#39;s happening in tamil cinema graphics <br>Same in Hollywood orginal
How could that guy hear what rock was telling him to do🤔🤔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=197">3:17</a> the third car forgot to press the button but still got boost! 🙃
1. How much weight can that Heli lift?! No seriously!!<br>2. If it can lift all that weight then lifting the first triluck must have been super easy, bearly an inconvinience!<br><br>3. Why I&#39;m questioning the non-existing physics of this nonsense?!
Me: &quot;You can&#39;t just ignore physics when you&#39;re making a movie.&quot;<br>Also me: &quot;The Fast and Furious movies are a masterpiece.&quot;
Brixton * casually just push the pilot out the helicopter * <br>Brixton: And have a day off! <br>Me: Brixton is really nice.
We gonna ignore the fact that he was fighting in a diaper then shows up on the truck fully dressed lmaooo
Wow wow.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

After watching this, I can see why people wanted to see Idris Elba as Bond.  I&#39;m still against a dark actor playing the part, but he was brilliant in this.
They all seem like they are in a game they just take it for fun
I love how fun and wholesome this movie is
Crazy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=138">2:18</a> they didn&#39;t get lifted because of that brothers weight
Now there is no difference in indian film industry and Hollywood <br>😂😂
Wye wood Dey have online Wepens
Yeah, that’s not how ANY OF THAT WORKS.
wow DAMN BRO I LİKE İT THİS MOVİE*?????!!!!!!.
When you aced PE but failed physics
Ah, we finally see the return of the F&amp;F franchise&#39;s trademark &quot;FTL in a bottle&quot;, AKA Nitrous.
The brother love demonstrated in this movie is really touching and wholesome man❤️
Why didnt he just shoot them
This secene is insane who like this scene like
Hit em with the moonshine
The USO’s are in the movie
Tow trucks are terrifying now
ههههههههههههههههه ههههههههههههههههه ههههههههههههههههه 😹
This scene was is my  fav scene ❤️
From where I can get that chain????
HOW HEAVY IS THAT TRUCK?
His Brothers Have Is Back That&#39;s Up What <br>🎬🎥
A bit too much don&#39;t you think?
NOOOOSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
They should rename this from Hobbs and shaw to how to piss off Issac newton the movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=137">2:17</a> this guy is my favorite for some reason
👍🇵🇱
Fun Fact: How many of you know that another brother of Hobbs you see at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=137">2:17</a> actually played the role of Doggie Kruger aka The Commander in Power Rangers SPD...??!!!🔥🔥
Nobody:<br><br><br><br>Shaw: 👁        👄 👁
Let&#39;s just skip physics
can we talk about how it goes from night in the last scene to day in this scene to night in the next scene
Damn
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=180">3:00</a>
Parents don’t get it?
Shoot the Rocket Launcher from both side wing!!! 😂😂😂 And BOOM!!! GAME OVER!!!! 😂😂😂
Shocar
why cant he simply shoot the chain to get rid of it.
Hobbs shaw and optimus prime
What can&#39;t Dwayne be the next protagonist for gta
Is there a game where you play as them?
It’s like Idris Elba waited for them to hook their cars together and then lift them up

All this idiot had to do is shoot the chain movies piss me off sometimes lol
He ain’t captain America
Everybody saying where&#39;s the physics on this scene?!?!?!<br>Duhh, of course what would you expect on a Hollywood movie a real physics???
Everybody going on about physics, meanwhile I&#39;m losing my mind over how many perfect hook-and-catches they made with those cables ON FIRST TRIES!!!
Jason wants Dwayne cheated on with 14,000 people.
One of the best scenes even though the physics ain&#39;t there
What is the movie name??
Indian movies these days
I turned off my brain cells to enjoy this movie.
As much of a joke this movie was, damn! Those trucks are badass
Ppl really say you have low iq when watching movies emphasis on movies cause unless they are based off real events damn near every movie is fantasy, fiction, unrealistic like the villains is an enhanced super human lmaoo with a motorcycle that transforms and can come to him damn near anywhere and this is not supposed to be fast and furious type movie I’m pretty sure this is own type of action movie just with the fast and furious presentation 🤦🏾 also the part where they went to Samoa wasn’t dumb it’s called strategy, the part about their weapons is actually smart and dumb cause for one your enemy can’t just pick it up and shot you but it can be hacked and you would be in a messed up situation it’s really how you perceive it honestly this movie was great to me and I didn’t know a lot of you don’t enjoy movies but instead just criticizes movies when a good 85% are not realistic and nothing more than fiction, fantasy etc. but hey it’s your opinion, it was great to me🤷🏽
Nitrous oxide means nothing at all if you don’t have traction...but HEY, thanks for assuming we are all idiots....
So ima say two things:<br><br>First: Their aim is immaculate <br><br>Second: Physics apparently don’t work for Hobbs and Shaw
So nobody gonna talk about where did roman reigns go after throwing the hooks<br>Edit: I know he got in the car, I wanna know how
more fast and furious then fast and furious
Really enjoyed with all my Super Heroes...but I missed VD
Yang milih Allah SWT like.
Goodbye fast and furious about street racing
That last guy was too much xD
Ultimately Its not easy to kidnapped Hobb&#39;s Girlfriend and Shaw&#39;s Sister..😆
Wait does that mean he’s my uncle
Bro why my dads childhood friend in this movie bro
must be a semi with some GREAT torque figures for that pull tbh
this is car centipede
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=50">0:50</a> why did he not just ask &quot;bro do u mind?&quot;
Many peoole might have missed End credit scene okay I will now spoil you.<br>Nick Fury : I&#39;m here to talk to you about Avengers
Parents : awww look at them playing with the cars and chopper : sons mind you bad guys will die
I am waiting for the choper shot them. But NOOOOO. I waste my time here
Who said Helicopters Are Better Than Trucks, Truck Are bette
Screenwriter: And so Hobbs is going to grab a chain holding the bad guys in the helicopter in one hand and hold on to the truck in the other hand to prevent it from flying away. <br>Head of Studio of whom the screenwriter is presenting to: Oh that’s ludicrous!!<br>Screenwriter: No, it’s Dwayne Johnson. <br>Head of Studio: Never mind.
I like how tow truck was also equipped with nitro
This is good opportunity for Chevrolet . I know.

The logic is out of the window, but the whole idea of brothers helping out each other brings a tear to my eye. :&#39;D
Name is movie
These feels like a hot wheels comercial xD<br><br><br><br><br>Also: that is a military modified chopper, a chopper that size could easy lift around 30,000 pounds, and that truck in the beginning is roughly 8,000 pounds, so that chopper should have taken off with no problem xD
its so over the top but i love it
Excellent stunt 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That&#39;s Roman reigns from wwe  and  the rock
this whole movie was just for the creators to have fun lol
This movie put those ridiculously supehuman Indian action movies to shame
i wish the fast and furious sequal would go back to be like the first 2 movies...STREETRACING
Yg tau dari tiktok belek🤣🤣🤣
Every one gangsta until fat guy comes in his car
And they speak about salman khan and tiger Shroff
Scenes like this you can&#39;t even find in Dragon Ball Z
That was horrible
I just realized that when shaw yells &quot;were gonna need nore weight&quot; the guy in the next truck is more heavyweight omg... idk if that was an intentional thing or not lol
I just don&#39;t get that he could left all the cars when they got attached to each other but couldn&#39;t left the first one all the way up. 🤔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=125">2:05</a> this reminded me of the tow truck glitch me and my friends tried to do in GTA, every time we were launched into the air
That chain would&#39;ve snapped like a baby bird&#39;s bones
What in the hell is this movie?
<b>Physics has entered the server</b><br><b>Hobbs has entered the Server</b><br><b>Shaw has entered the Server</b><br><b>Physics has left the server</b>
What my mind sees when playing GTA Online 😂😂😂😂🤣😅
Y&#39;all be bitching about the physics but I just think it&#39;s fabulous.... You don&#39;t watch this for physics lessons. You watch to be entertained. And as for entertainment Y&#39;all gotta admit: it&#39;s really cool and wacky in a way that you don&#39;t really see that often
Hobbs<br>Shaw
Not Helicopter vs truck<br>Helicopter vs The rock
that is just stupid...<br>I mean - if that heli could have picked up 3 cars, it could easily pick up the very first one, instead of &quot;fihgting&quot; with it :V<br>Not to mention that is not how physics work ;__;
That helicopter was aimed directly at the truck why didnt it just open fire and end this horrible scene
wow super cheezy fake
Fentastic
Optimus prime vs blackout
Even tho this stunt is not possible the front car didn’t even have a front diff or axles
It&#39;s the best scene I like from the entire movie

I thought the car was about to transform to some kind of megazord.
Fear the moonshine!!
When he threw the hooks on the axles I died 😂😂
The scene were they, hung over the clip and pushed the turbo in, reminded me of the the Fast and Furious i wanna see
Why dont he aim at chain and brake it
I didn&#39;t know I would be so freaking hyped seeing NOS again xD
Why would there scrap trucks have Ricaro steering wheels ?
Ух ты !!
Brixton had all of that missile on his chopper and he didn&#39;t use any of them???
Shaw: We&#39;re gonna need more weight! <br>Hobbs&#39; Brother: BEHOLD!!
If he could pull three and a half cars off the ground he would&#39;ve been able to pull just one 🤦‍♂️
so many usos
You were all fine with the robot superman and got mad at this? Lmao. Crybabies because diesel isnt in this one?
I guess now fast n furious will be racing with trucks
<b>Sir Isaac Newton has left the chat</b>
Mythbusters will have they&#39;re hands full with this one
Physics has left the chat
When did hobbs put on his shirt and pants
Why the helicopter didn&#39;t fire on the car?
Don&#39;t tell them about sense!
When Initial D goes too far
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=62">1:02</a>c
Uh...pretty sure that whole time they could’ve used the 80mm rockets on the chopper to blow up Hobbs and Shaw. Kind of dumb on Brixton’s part for not having that happen.
I need boy friend
Dude I don&#39;t even care that this is absolutely ludicrous it&#39;s entertaining
This is a cartoon.  What a joke 👎
Maaf ya allah hamba liat ini

Bunch of bullshit scenes in this movie.
wooooooow it took 4 of you to beat me
Does Physics apply to this?
Excellent. ♡ T.E.N.
People talk about physics but I really enjoyed this scene
If Fast and Furious and Just Cause 4 had a son:
I have a guilty pleasure of enjoying dumb physic&#39;s breaking luck scenes like this. There too much fun to watch for me.
full movies
I swear NOS is basically God&#39;s fuel in the FoF franchise giving hacked and 100% guaranteed wins no matter the situation
In reality, Hobbs and Shaw wud be hanging from the chopper midair while trying to climb up the chain which Brixton would cut and the rest of Hobb&#39;s fam would be stranded on the island with broken axles and bumpers
I love th rocks dad is wearing flip flops
Dumbest action scene ever; give me my 80s action heroes any day.
I hate action movies that use CGI too much.
When a movie makes you say: pinche mentirotas!

Welp this is not a fast &amp; furious movie if doesn’t have cars and nitro boosts.

That truck is definitely optimus prime mini<br> edit: chopper h megadron
This movie don’t have physics and is very dumb. But at least is soo entertaining and fun. I don’t care. I just want silly/cheesy action with my friend and fun time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=182">3:02</a> they stole this from the fast and furious
Still the best scene in rhe movie
If shaw, brixton and hobbs worked together they could possibly fight captain america
this only has in fast and furious that such a helicopter cannot lift a car !!
It was my first time watch Hobbs and Shaw it made my night when I saw the big dog in this movie 💕

The unrealistic physics is so confusing but whatever. Fun to watch.
So this is what happened after Pentecost retired from the PPDC.
Not really about cars
why god why;(
Roman reigns is good
Why would they drop them if the chain is still on the helicopter???? They would kill themself to!?
This scene has its own seperate FANBASE🔥🔥🔥
I think optimus prime help them them ,😅😅😅
that 2 tyre griping was extremely logicless and physics defying
Nobody?? that man in the second car oooooh dam umm
This scene defiles physics logics sanity everything.<br>Quite simliar to those Tamil movie heroes who fight with bananas.

Didnt like the movie because its soo Hella over top and that&#39;s saying alot about a fast and furious movie where physics just hinders the script
Hollywood movies are never before ever after mindblock action scenes that&#39;s way they are no.1 movies in the world i accept it.  Any body accept this press like button👍
Great scene and all but why is he only pulling back more when another vehicle joins?

Were the Usos in the movie? They should have been if they werent
Say what you will about this scene not making sense but I believe the fast and furious franchise don’t make sense they make car films with lots of action and I think this delivers true
Lol, this movie was asinine.
That&#39;s like 16 tonnes of weight to be lifted by a 4 tonne helicopter engine<br><br>I dunno man. I dunno
No way he could hear to activate the moonshine blaster. So many background noises...
this scene was fun to watch who cares about physics lol

Braun Strowman Should Be In This Video.
No cema cuhhh 😂
Hitting  boost and making the wheels spin would give you way less traction, not more, you&#39;re better off just putting it in park and stepping away.
Hobbs was wearing a skirt in the scene just before and now he got jeans and a T-shirt.

Best action movie
The Rock doesn&#39;t fall to physics

It&#39;s hilarious 🤣 10/10
So a mid sized helicopter can carry the weight of 3 trucks? So without load at full throttle it must be able to break the sound barrier vertically. Lets not forget about the technology behind the front wheels of the first truck, able to get traction on dirt with the weight of 4 trucks and full throttle helicopter as resistance.

Such imaginations.  Holiwood is kooku
People complaining about physics, when fast and furious did 20 seconds at 120 mph 1/4 mile.
So I guess that chain is rated for over 30k lbs or something

The director of this movie got mad for completely failing at physics exams at college so they made Hobbs and Shaw to defy the laws of physics.

I like to know the sequences of the cars coming together. When did they get a chance to plan all these things and have are peace in their heirs to hear each other?

Salman Khan would definitely love this.
what&#39;s the point in having a helicopter with guns on it when you don&#39;t even use them.

Stupid scene

Нифигасе, Болливуд отдыхает!!!
Director:physics nah not my type

You can watch Rambo from the 80s and legitimately think, yes, theoretically it can happen, he can in theory dodge all the bullets and kill all soviet soldiers, but this??
Couldn&#39;t put an extra can of gas on a helicopter manifesting firefighters and equipment. Watching this is not even fun, it&#39;s so not close to reality, how is this fun to watch? Its worst then bullshit, at least bullshit is hard to distinguish from real thing sometimes 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷‍♂️
ЦАРИ

Dumb

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=115">1:55</a><br><br>This movie is realistic cuz only Chevrolet can performe so well. <br>I will buy a Chevrolet tomorrow.<br>Because Chevrolet are best. Not a Chevrolet shill but I just love chevrolet cuz Chevroles are best, as seen in this movie, where Chevrolet save the day, of course by being a chevrolet. <br>Did i forget to mention Chevrolet?<br><br>maybe my brain work better if it was made by Chevrolet.<br><br>Edit: Ended up buying 4 whole Chevroles. my testosterone is increasing.
My favorite part of the whole movie
I wasted a few dollars renting this thing. It was ridiculous
I like how the show the suspension and inside engine.

Hobbs and Shaw was a true  documentary
Super acting yaar<br>Really wow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapP5W153YE&amp;t=58">0:58</a> What did he say?
Hehe. Dobra bajka. Ten helikopter ma taką siłę ciagu ze w pizdu by ten wynalazek poderwal do gory na samym początku
Cuidado los rusos con el pelado y con rambo los dejan sin helicóptero  estos bárbaros
What a load of rubbish
They need 100 cars
That’s 4 cars wow
Fast &amp; Furious, Hobbs and shaw: <b>Flying cars</b><br>Gravity: <b>wait that’s illegal</b>
Filme mentiroso fala sério..nunca q iria vê uma bosta dessa
Eso se puede hacer o solo es película?
If they made the movie this make it more realistic that Apache what did you just blow to s*** right out of that truck we wouldn&#39;t throw him out of the helicopter because he has a safety harness
Que fulmão&quot; e o tipo de filme que eu gosto de assistir, alguém sabe me dizer o nome desse filme?
Bolywood))))
Trình diễn hư màn ảnh ngoạn mục .
I&#39;ve seen it all 🤦🏾‍♂️
Hey Jason Statham, did you ever see the George Clooney interview?  The one where he talks about keeping the Batman costume on the wall of his office to remind himself what happens when you take a role strictly for money? ?
This makes all the dumb crap in the fast and furious movies look smart. Daaaagone boys,  I can&#39;t believe that Jason Statham and the Rock could keep a straight face long enough for the crew to film this garbage.
Stupid scene

Let&#39;s just take a moment to enjoy and appreciate the epicness in this scene. Forget about physics.
Oh yes, sure.

Amo o flime
Meio forçado isso aí 🤣🤣
What crap.
What a load of bullshit
Every time they shift/ floor the pedal it focuses on the Hobbs Customs plate LMFAO

العراقي مر من هنا 😁
Wow, these guys in the comments must be really miserable.<br><br>Word of advice: If you don&#39;t like the movie, then move on along. Don&#39;t ruin it for others.
😁😂😃😄😅😆😅😄😃😂😁<br>Даже не смотрел и нет никакого желания смотреть это тухлятину.Фокксники ёба...е
Goes to show how life can beat technology
They said that they are disabling the laws of physics for now.
Ampuki suarpes fokio car
In reality the helicopter would pull the truck
everyone should have probably been dead around the 3 minute mark but ok
Very Good picture Sir ji
I Love it Hob Muvi Lovely Looking
All those trucks must of had all wheel drive to continue to move forward with helicopter raising the rear end and it&#39;s still speeding down the road
What a stupid scene. Whoever thought of it NEEDS examined. Whoever produced it needs institutionalized. Whoever paid to see it needs worse.
PHYSICS: <br>“...What about—“<br><br>THE ROCK:<br>“IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK!!!”
What&#39;s with the comments.... It&#39;s entertaining and both are doing a great job. It&#39;s an awesome movie
More like superhumans than super furious
Говнофильм с говноактерами
Gta online flaahback.
Shaw:&quot;We&#39;re gonna need more weight!&quot;<br><b>Brings in the big guy</b>
What a load of s**t
I know this is only a movie but in real life a Blackhawk helicopter cannot lift if possible Maybe one of those small Vehicles up in the front but other than that that makes up for good entertainment.
It&#39;s like Fast &amp; Furious 6 all over again.
The limit is crossed
Movies have become stupid.  That could have been cool but they went too far and ruined it.
ممكن اسم الفلم
A cybernetically enhanced soldier who possesses superhuman strength, a brilliant mind and a lethal pathogen that could wipe out half of the world&#39;s population, couldn&#39;t just sever/shoot/cut the chain holding his chopper down?
🤤🤤
When the uso (the fat guy)came in I was sooo donnne
fast Hobbs Shaw truck ... not Yeah Oh no lol help
... off for What truck lol po to yeah Oh Hobbs  trucks<br> One
Hobbs  lol truck<br>ahahah

Yoo whats happening
One of my favorite scenes in the whole franchise!
Шо за бред
some of the worst CGI ive ever seen
why dont you shoot the chain
👏👏👏
What is thinking ?? What is reality ??<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Eh, we don&#39;t need em anyway.
Can we have on simple use of physics in these movies<br>Screenwriters: Hahahahahaha...no
I was wondering where the hell the nitro came from, then I remembered this is technically fast and furious lmao
Please suffer with me in my channel Jointly love you
WUT.
شكد يجذبون
Why didn&#39;t chopper use NOS?
My favorite scene in this movie by far
Idk guys, that chopper wing is pretty damn strong
Physics : exists<br>Dwayne Johnson : &quot; I&#39;m about to end this man&#39;s whole career&quot;
Physics be like : Am I Joke to You
Einstein be like : Am i a joke to You
this faker than wwe
I&#39;ve seen more realistic laws of physics in a bollywood movie
😵😲🙃😱
How real they pulling a helicopter with a truck<br>1500hp - am i joke to you🤣
looks like Rebecca has some skills.
So... The copter had a problem lifting the first one... But all of a sudden was able to lift almost 4??? Okay. Lol.
Вот сказочники. В школу вас снова, чтобы сказку хоть делать красиво😫🤣🤣🤣
Physics has left the chat
One of the only things related to the actual &quot;fast and furious&quot; in this movie
Hahahahh american movie = funy and idiot 😂😂😂
Expectation vs reality
Shaw: &quot;Gonna need more weights!&quot; <br><b>*Le big fat asian samoan Han appeared*</b>
