The Berlin Wall worked for almost 30 years until the USSR agreed to tear it down.
Why were those 22 other people not vaccinated?
Having a Japanese passport is not what makes a person ethnically Japanese.
Does Felix believe he isnt a millenial?

I‚Äôve never gotten a flu shot and I‚Äôve never gotten the flu. My brother gets the flu quite often tho. But even still. I‚Äôve never had it. So I will never get the shot. But obviously I‚Äôm vaccinated because I‚Äôm not a moron..

Pewds for President, so he can ban kids.
Bruh 12 oz is the whole bottle so 50% more of 12 oz is 6 oz making the total 18 oz, how&#39;s that even hard math?

People are just dumb. There is no hope. Social media pushing the dumbest agendas. Drama.
The person criticizing the yukata-wearing Japanese girl and the &quot;if you are white you can&#39;t speak Spanish&quot; person are wrong in so many ways that I would need an entire TED Talk to mention them all ‚ò†Ô∏è<br><br>I specially mean the second one, as I&#39;m a Spaniard lmao
This video is very weird post cvirus
I&#39;ve never heard pewdiepie say retarded before lmao never noticed that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=760">12:40</a> This will never not piss me off. I have to skip this whenever it comes up. People try to insult Thomas when he‚Äôs one of the kindest and most genuine person I‚Äôve ever met. <br><br>I‚Äôve been following him for years now, and I saw this tweet when it happened. He did not ask them to put it there, and if you knew even the slightest thing about him, you‚Äôd know that. He says they recognized him from ordering from them so frequently in the replies too, but even if you don‚Äôt believe him, believe me, getting him to compliment himself is extremely challenging. He didn‚Äôt do that. <br><br>It makes me so mad that people spread a false image of a person around making them seem like a completely different person than they actually are, ESPECIALLY if that person is as sweet and caring as Thomas is.
To be fair the wall did slow people down.

You have a Calcium deficiency Felix. You can tell by the white flecks on your finger nails.
Fact: 1/10lb burger is McDonald&#39;s cheeseburger. Just a regular cheeseburger. If you make it a Mcdouble, it&#39;d be a 2/10 lb burger.
To be fair. Who wants to eat something called &quot;a third burger&quot;?
Matthew 10:38, 39. Whoever does not take up his cross, and follow after me, is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Jesus is speaking in this word that those who prefer the things of the world, sin, entertainment and reject him, are not worthy of him. Taking up the cross and following Jesus means crucifying oneself to worldly things. People on the contrary are wanting to find their lives in this world, they don&#39;t want to lose their lives to follow it, they don&#39;t want to lose fun, sinful pleasures, lust, fame, etc., etc. Many think they can live a little longer, when they are old, they accept Jesus. We move to the other side when we least expect it, we often don&#39;t have time to do that. You will be lost and in torment afterwards. Don&#39;t delay, he calls you. Hugs!
I wonder of pewds realizes that his country Sweden is ACTUALLY putting microchips in people&#39;s hands.....the irony of him making fun of it

Soap operas are crazy. You got twins that both get passed by the devil. The brother is married to his sisters best friend, and his sister was with this doctor until he found out from the brother while possessed, that the sister and her friend hooked up. There‚Äôs so much more to that story.

I once watched a nigerian movie and legit smoke came out of my computer. Coincidence? Don&#39;t think so.
I know this comment is very late and he&#39;ll probably never read this but it&#39;s kinda sad that people dont know that the avocado market is very much influenced by the cartels that exist in Mexico because of how profitable it is
Sister would have been 3 when he was 6 and 6-3=3 so 70-3=67<br>So she is 67 when he is 70
okay 1 thing I am now holding against pewds....is that he doesn&#39;t know one of the most popular movies of all time (if anyone else doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s called the breakfast club you should go watch it!)
WHERE IS POOPDIE ITS 2022!!
that movie was <br>The Breakfast Club, about a group of emotionally fucked up teenagers getting detention together.
Isn&#39;t it obvious that KuruHS is at the start of this video?
Rip breakfast club
its my future, i want to be a virgin. phd can wait
The true try not to facepalm is the fact that he doesn&#39;t know what the breakfast club is
People always claim that they are in that field, like the mechanic one but doesn&#39;t know a manual transmission car. WTF
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=212">3:32</a> just like earth was also observed to be round.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=100">1:40</a>  as an atheist  i dont care what religion your a part of, but i think its so fucking cringe calling people out for being religious
Not knowing breakfast club by the photo.... We disown you from the middle generation lol

Felix, the influenza vaccine is very important. The virus mutates so often. If you got your shot last year, you‚Äôre not covered for those mutated strains. I would hope people get it in Europe considering how cold your winters are, which means the flu can spread like wildfire because everyone is inside away from the cold. I kinda wish he wouldn‚Äôt speak on topics he‚Äôs ignorant about. Especially on topics like this where his opinions have impact. Medical professionals come into contact with sick people every day. They have a social responsibility.
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re mad about atheists being right
why did you say the r slur
&quot;the gov&#39;t just needs to step in and vaccinate everyone&quot; wow that quote aged...interestingly

‚ÄúI dont think you need to get vaccinated for every flu, that seems stupid‚Äù<br><b>*Famous last word*</b>
With the age one if she was 6 then her sister was 3 and now she&#39;s 70 which means it&#39;s been 64 years so her sister is 67.

I don‚Äôt understand cultural appropriation either. It‚Äôs weird when others wish for equality but won‚Äôt let others indulge in what makes their life special.
As a mechanical engineering student i can assure you, that you don&#39;t lose all sex appeal just because you&#39;re studying engineering.<br>Quite on the contrary in fact
I facepalmed at the first ad ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=472">7:52</a> Something similar actually happened in Hong Kong. A man had a heart attack and was sent to the hospital by his son and help was asked immediately after arrival but the staff told him to call an ambulance instead because it was ER&#39;s job. A doctor walked by and offered his help but the man eventually didn&#39;t make it and the court said his death was natural ü§∑
this video provides some great examples of why I can&#39;t stand these supposedly &quot;funny&quot; subreddits.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=298">4:58</a> in fact, no, vaccnation dont prevent you to get an infection, vaccines help you to fight the infection more effectively.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=43">0:43</a> IMO that take aged incredibly well, given that we&#39;d be done with Covid if every adult (without valid medical exemptions) had gotten the vax.
If you think about it, our kids having it easier isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing. Good times produce weak men and weak men produce bad times

How do u not know the breakfast club
God how i hate fucking ads
The mustard is right tho. 50% of 12 is 6 and 6+12 is 18. So 18 oz

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=93">1:33</a> Felix, this is specifically a christian calling out an athiest. This is literally the opposite of what you&#39;re talking about.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=698">11:38</a> whoever posted this is as stupid as the other ppl that got posted about  because 50%, or half, of 12 is 6, so 50% more, or half of it plus itself,  which is 6, + 12, equals 18, so yes, 18 is indeed 50% more then 12. Unless I&#39;m stupid, which is highly likely
the biggest facepalm for me was when he didn&#39;t know what the breakfast club was

i think humanity had always been this dumb as an unfortunately necessary constant from which the mistakes of idiots and intelligent people alike serve as lessons from which we learn from and grow as a species; I think it just seems like the increase of stupidity nowadays due to the increase of population worldwide giving the illusion of an increase in stupidity because more people = more stupid mistakes.

At the time I didn&#39;t get why all of a sudden there was this anti-vax stuff. Now I&#39;m pretty sure the anti-vax surge that cropped up was to establish a certain narrative for Covid-19 vaccinations.
Sorry to break it to you but vaccinated people can still spread the disease and can still get it too. It&#39;s not some magic serum that makes you immune to covid lmao
as a 63 year old I can tell you that, from my experience, Yes, people have always been this dumb .<br><br>They just weren&#39;t so proud of it.

Atheist&#39;s are <i>so</i> against religion because, Theist&#39;s demand their believes become <i>our</i> laws! Followed by their faith be taught in <i>our</i> public schools to ALL children! These people want science classes that teach evolution is NOT a fact. Also, that the dinosaurs aren&#39;t real. They aren&#39;t simple &quot;believers&quot;. They&#39;re demand we ALL follow their brainwashed ways! Currently they&#39;re abolishing all abortions. That&#39;s not even in their Bible. They made that part up completely on their own.

There is a whooping cough vaccine, it&#39;s recommended between 16-32 weeks during pregnancy. There is a flu vaccine at least here in the UK every year, they are given to vulnerable groups and first line workers. They pick the most prevalent strain of flu for that year. So that is why we receive a new one yearly.

Yes, most people have always been this dumb. The difference is that, now, these dumb people are being praised as ‚Äúbrave‚Äù for expressing their stupid feelings. They used to be told how dumb they were every time they spoke and they were eventually conditioned to shut up.

Before you pull the racism card at least do a easy Google. &quot;Since a¬†black¬†surface absorbs almost all of incident radiation in the solar spectrum and reflects very little of that which is incident, it heats up very¬†fast¬†compared to an opaque white surface, which reflects much more of incident solar radiation than a¬†black¬†opaque surface.&quot;  -Google

Pewdiepies reaction to a Christian trying to prove Atheists wrong is to say Atheists need to stop trying to prove Christians wrong? Wtf?

I just hit like just for your take on &quot;cultural appropriation.&quot; I still believe imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. A Cherokee owned company manufactured toy tomahawks just so Atlanta Braves fans could do the &quot;tomahawk chop&quot;. They took that appropriation as a compliment.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=617">10:17</a><br>Is a trick question, her younger sister is actually 3 when she was 6 so if you remove 6 from 70 you will get 64 then add the little sisters age then her age will be now 67, so her older sisters age is 70 while she&#39;s 67

I like how Pewdiepie complains about Atheists calling out religious people on a thread started by a religious person calling out Atheists. Cool bias m8.
It is always good to remind yourself that the answer to the question:&quot; are humans that stupid?&quot; Is always, always! YES
&quot;ath dumb&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=468">7:48</a> FELIX??? ARE U BUYINH CRYPTO????? NICE
Walls work, thats a fact
Felix‚Äòs eyes are so beautiful. Thought that just had to be said
300 thousand K .... lmao
Woah what an anti vax prediction
Hey I know this video is over a year old and that nobody&#39;s gonna see this comment, but if pewdiepie ran for president and promised the removal of social media, I&#39;d vote, and I&#39;m very curious as to see who&#39;s with me and for that same reason.
Here in Australia we have a influenza/flu issues so we have to get vaccinated because a lot of people die from it in this country.<br><br>Edit: I‚Äôm not sure how it is in other countries however, but it gets really bad here.
So Pewds has NO idea what The Breakfast Club is??? Way to make miss Molly Ringwald sad.....
Omg the vaccination and chip comments he made...
We‚Äôre pretty much the smartest dumbest animals on earth
Bruh I know how to use a rotary phone when I was 10
I have never gotten the flu vaccine and I have never had the flu and I rarely ever get sick
So... the 300k avocado illegal selling is a real thing. People are being murdered in Mexico for decades because of the interest from the cartels on avocado market.
Im cristian ty for defending us
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=655">10:55</a> They exist because their parents didn&#39;t teach them correctly. I used to be the same exact way getting triggered by the most minute things but then I grew up and realised how stupid and needlessly toxic I was. Some never learn though.
When you watch this in 2021 and realize elon does wanna put chips in peoples heads no not through a vaccine and there&#39;s other dumb people afraid of nano bots in the covid vaccine pewds predicted the future confimed
This kid once sed <br>Can u see god? No? So god isn&#39;t real<br><br>So I sed<br>Can u see ur brain?no?so ur brain isn&#39;t real <br><br>And he just walked away
Handicaps without hand be like
Calm down with the fucking hate on antivaxers. If the debate between Christianity and atheists is cring, this definitely is too. Just let people believe what they want

Cultural appropriation is different then cultural appreciation it‚Äôs culture appropriation if you are doing some thing or wearing something associated with a culture disrespectfully and taking it as a joke or a costume or whatever and culture appreciation is wearing or doing some thing from another culture with respect and knowing how to do it right

That 50%  more mustard bottle was actually right! 50% more of 12 oz = 18 oz because half of 12 is 6
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=172">2:52</a> The flu vaccine is pointless. It guarantees you get sick whereas if you don&#39;t get it, there&#39;s a high chance you don&#39;t. Imagine being able to make an individual decision based on the facts that matter to you. It&#39;s almost like you are able to think for yourself and don&#39;t have to be pressured by people who mean nothing to you. They want to think their life matters when in reality it doesn&#39;t. Its funny because the system feeds off of that. Why do you think there are so many ads saying &quot;masks save lives&quot; when in reality it does nothing but reduce your oxygen intake. Weak minded people who had shitty parents ,that gave them participation trophies, see that shit and eat it up. Then when they see someone without a mask on, they are angry because we don&#39;t give it the same meaning they do. Their life is meaningless. Your life is meaningless. My life is meaningless. When you are dead guess what happens to the world. Nothing. <b>ANYTHING YOU ACCOMPLISH IN YOUR LIFE WILL NOT MATTER 100 YEARS FROM NOW, NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE GET TOGETHER AND YELL A CERTAIN MARXIST SLOGAN</b>
this video can be summed up with one word: America
‚Äú This is where the government needs to just step in and vaccinate everyone ‚Äú jokes that aged very well.
Well abortion can cause permenant damage to young body&#39;s and can actually be very unsafe depending on how far long the pregnancy is.

The math thing in the flight was almost sure  a Karen that got scared , a becky that was paranoid or a Chad on the hunt
That one guy without arms :)
I mean, if you take it off the equation natural selection, then yes, we are getting more stupid.

The avocado thing is actually big time criminal job. No joke Mexican gangs will grow a shit load of avocados and make serious bank off of selling them in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas
God this video reminds me why I&#39;m subscribed to pewdiepie
I facepalmed witching the first -30 seconds bc ads

Felix, it was the Christian reaching out and provoking atheists in the photo you showed while bashing atheists behaving dumb.
When he talked about the measles, it has a new meaning nowadays
The answer is 67 felix their sister is 67. If their sister was 3 when they were 6 then they are 3 years younger. 70-3=67
the beginning of this video did not age well
Lol that was supposed to be 67 the answer not 35üòÇ
As in an immature shouldn‚Äôt get to choose who lives and dies
It&#39;s weird how everyone in the comments is saying that the measles outbreak predicted covid, even though there&#39;s hundreds or even thousands of minor disease outbreaks every year that affect way more than 22 people...
But it&#39;s literally the religious people trying to call out atheists and failing at it in that post, not the other way around. You&#39;re basically complaining about atheists replying to people that literally asked them a question...
Pewdssssss nooooooo!!!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=150">2:30</a> is the Breakfast Club. was an instant classic

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=683">11:23</a> its 300,000 Or its 300K if you say it 300,000k then it would be 300,000,000.

‚ÄúThis is where the government just needs to step in and fucking vaccinate everyone‚Äù best pre-COVID quote.

Have the option to get vaccinated to let them do normal things without risking other people‚Äôs lives. Refuse to vaccinate. Continue to complain....
Did pewds really say 35 at &quot;when I was 6 my sister was half my age, now I&#39;m 70 how old is my sister?&quot; lmaoooo üíÄ

You could say white robots are subconsciously racist. Make more black robots. But robots are made to serve people. So if they are black, that would be racist. Its basically never good.
I guess I&#39;m that 0.49%

It&#39;s dumb not to get the flu vaccine every year, even in Europe ;)

Food for thought: in an alternate reality, robots would be black or yellow and people would be racists again. White robot cleaning the house or helping you put items in the shopping cart is a problem? Stop finding racism where there isn&#39;t any, seriously

We do live in A society
$300k<br><br>pewdiepie: three hundred thousand k?1?!?
So we‚Äôre all gonna focus on the fact he didn‚Äôt know what the breakfast club was instead of the fact that he said the r slur?
I gotta admit, I was annoyed when he didn&#39;t notice the &quot;my sister was half my age&quot; joke.
If I ever become president I will ban social media<br>- Pewdiepie, social media influencer
this aged well
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre people always this dumb‚Äù no, there will always be idiots, but there used to be natural selection
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=557">9:17</a> I bet most people can use rotary phones, cause ya know it&#39;s a pretty easy design that requires little thinking. It&#39;s just those dumbasses that have no life skills at all that struggle with simple stuff like that.
Cultural appropriation is the dumbest thing ever, especially in the USA or ya know the cultural melting pot
Didnt the religious dude called out the atheist?
Funny enough, the numbers we use are derived from Arabic numerals. So dumb bitch was kinda right in the stupidest way
White robots are racist? What? It‚Äôs because plastic is naturally white why spend money to paint a robot that isn‚Äôt fully working tf haha
Don‚Äôt say the r slur man
If we&#39;re white we can&#39;t speak Spanish<br>I guess spain doesn&#39;t exist now
The fragile door coronally supply because peripheral probably watch between a premium father-in-law. noxious,  fresh repair
If you ever lose faith in humanity just remember the Earth was formed from rocks and water and someone made bluetooth out of that
I got the flu every year for like six years then when i skipped i didn‚Äôt get it
im 22 European and i can easily use rotary phone , im pretty sure its American kids that don&#39;t know how to use old technology
I was practicing writing Spanish for my Spanish class and there was a Karen next to me so she said I was writing in some terrorist English but then the security guard spoke Spanish so he yelled at the Karen in Spanish and she went crazy ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-Upc54lg8&amp;t=704">11:44</a> the label is actually CORRECT here because when they mean 50% more, they mean 50% of the original content was added, so 12oz x 50% = 6oz, 12oz + 6oz = 18oz.<br><br>Which proves that the label is correct.<br><br>Edit: He said it later in the video.

the word &quot;retard&quot; shouldn&#39;t be used as an insult, its a literal medical diagnosis that they cannot control. its like calling someone a &quot;fag&quot; which i know that&#39;s a word for a cigarette or something in some places which is okay if you use it in that context but when you use it to insult someone its not okay. being gay is something people cannot control or fix. i&#39;m not too pressed about it but i thought id just put this out here lol

Felix on the Thomas Sanders one says how what thomas done was cringe but on another video he contradicts himself and says that what thomas did was meant to be a joke. This is, like the theme of this video, a face palm

Walls are usually white too, it&#39;s not racism, it just looks better and reflects more lights.<br>Robots also look much better when white, and it&#39;s better to check if any fluids are leaking from it for example.

Walls do indeed work. USA needs to keep out the crap of the world out in the world, not in USA. Coming from a Mexican perspective, therefore, I can&#39;t be racist.

When i was 6 my sister was half my age (3 years old, 3 years younger). Now I am 70. So the sister should be 67 (still 3 years younger) not 35.

I was eating during the food appointment one, I nearly choked
1 year later but if you didnt know the science explanation of jesus walking on water is that in those times the water in that sea was full of salt so normal people could walk on it and im pretty sure that you can still but i dont remember where it was ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Not Pewds saying the r slur.....
The next face palm refit post should be Felix not knowing what breakfast club is
I&#39;m guessing pewdiepie is agnostic. a religious group that doesn&#39;t believe in God but isn&#39;t atheist. While agnostics don&#39;t know what to believe most of them respect everyone&#39;s beliefs, but some agnostics would consider atheism being stupid nonsense since whole porpoise of atheism is about not being in a religion and not believing anything. For example some agnostics think celebrating atheism which is celebrating not believing is like celebrating something that they don&#39;t do, it&#39;s kinda like saying that you are in a group of non-golfers or non-gamers and you are somehow different in that and are deserved to have different treatment. I am myself somewhat agnostic but have gorwn up in Christianity so I don&#39;t really know if I should be Christian or agnostic, so I consider myself being both. I still respect each religion. I don&#39;t mind if someone makes fun of Christianity or any other religion as long as I find it somewhat funny, but seeing atheists trying to tell the &quot;truth&quot; to people is cringe af. So next time you call someone childish for believing whatever God they believe, you should know your fucking place, trash!
