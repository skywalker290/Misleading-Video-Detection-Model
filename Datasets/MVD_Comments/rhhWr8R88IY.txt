Lyrics 🙂🙂🙂🙂
This song is so underrated 🥺
I miss my dad....it&#39;s been 5 years without him.....With all those responsibilities on the shoulders of a 16yo kid...somehow it helped me to get matured in such a young age.... Whenever I feel helpless in life...I remember how dad used to do all these things so effortlessly...Or say with so much effort without showing it to anyone 😊....
❤️
Sabse best ❤️❤️
god blessed you bb
It&#39;s been 16 days now and I&#39;m still unable to accept that my abbu is no more with us
I never ignored my father&#39;s call after watching this video😶❤️

Soooooo underrated........
Was not talking to my dad for more than a month due to some indifferences. This song made me realize the mistake I was making. Finally when I just uttered “Papa” he started sobbing and we embraced tightly.
Watched the video and heard the song after many years, it seriously passes an awesome message, never cut a call before receiving it, the best bhai,I felt safar was better, but no, idk, everyone has their own opinion
I can relate to this because my father is also not with me <br> I miss my papa so much
I love you ❤️
really got goosebumps BHAI
Kabhi kabhi ek chota sa tinka he kaphi hota heh insaan ko badal nemeh ,<br>Kya soch heh is gaane ki lajabab😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩

I did not know about your parents Bhuvan. I was wondering why you stopped being active all of a sudden. Now that I know it, I have nothing to offer you other than my and prayers. We are with you. No matter how far, we are with you. Your Baba and Ayi have spread everywhere! May you be in their loving presence till the very end. You are and always will be a shining star. All the very best.<br>-a mere fan

I JUST WANNA LISTEN THIS SONG.....
reast in peace mummy papa really criying after listening this song 😣😣
It&#39;s incredible to be honest. Where our mainstream artists (be it bollywood or pop) are simply reduced to bunch of commercial sell outs, here&#39;s a man who is not even a full time pro singer ( but an incredible comedian) tell such a beautiful, simple yet moving story through the music and the video is simply mind-blowing. Our music industry needs to relearn this simple effective power of innocent stories. Only then can we regain the lost glory of the golden days. Keep going BB!
I literally cried after hearing it. It is so emotional yrrr. Love you bb 😭😭😭😭❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
we will always love you bam don&#39;t worry and just believe in yourself
Mind blowing
one of my favourite💛
Best song 👌
What ever BB drops on youtube becomes a fenomina ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Bhai chah me rula diya 😭😭😢😢
Jitne log isko dislike kiye hai na, sale sabko dimag nahi hai
Bhai rula dia
God is with you .....just imagining without parents I get scared...and you are going through this period
Bhai faaaaaaddddddd song <br><br>Too relateable for me
Eagerly waiting for your next video ...BB❤️❤️
One and only BB❤️❤️God of YouTube...❤️❤️❤️
This guy is the best Individual creator YouTube will ever get.<br>Peace.<br>Love you dada.

Today in 2021 😓😓😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😭😭😓😓😓😓😓😓😓😓😓😓😓😓😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I think bhuvan is listening to this song right know in memory of his Aai and Baba.  But he was a good kid. And I think he full filed his duty as a son. Don&#39;t worry bhuvan. I think your mom and dad are very proud in heaven. Whenever you (bhuvan) read this , do remember that you are a good man and a good son.
Classic s
It haunts me being alone in home without anyone there or to come back though I fight with my parents.<br>God give BB the strength to endure the pain.We are with you.
Why beautiful songs like this is this much underrated, while many bogus songs get almost billion reach?,😢
this song is very emotional or bb ke parents ke death ke bad to ise sun ke rona aa rha he 😭😭😭 duniya ko hasane wala bb aaj unki life ke sbse worst stage pr khada he ........ stay strong bhuvan we are always for you ❤❤
Listening to this song after the tragic news of Bhuvan&#39;s parents made me understand it&#39;s lyrics aptly. This song really is an emotion. I hope that BB u stay strong and keep hustling
Parents mann ke pas hai toh saath hai chahe pas na ho.

Strong emotions behind this song

This song make me cry<br>When I listen every time this make me cry
I lost my Nana ji a year ago. But memories of him are still fresh. One thing I got understood that yaar jo log tumhare pass baith kar baate karna chahte unko time do chhahe kitna bhi important kaam ho. Unki kami zindagi bhar khalti h. Meri commissioning ceremony hone wali h but Jiske liye army join ki thi wahi nhi h mujhko iss vardi mein dekne ke liye. Anyways BB bhai aapki musical videos Kaafi emotional aur kaafi kuchh sochne par majboor kar deti h. 💓💓
I can&#39;t imagine how much pain you are in right now after loosing your world.......lots of strength to you ❤️
Who says good music doesn&#39;t exist in this generation 🥺💗
mere papa ko mene 3 din pehele kho diya , gaye kyu magar mere humsafar jaha ka hai milna pataa, ye line muje har aak bar sunne ke baad , rulati hai 🙂😖

Know that they are always with you &amp; wherever they are now, they are very happy &amp; so so so proud of you❤️! You are the best son any parents could ask for! Dev tumchya patishi ubha asava hich majhi prarthna 🙏  We are all with you forever ♾ May their souls Rest In Peace 🙏 Om Shanti 🙏

BB, I don&#39;t know how many times I have heard this song , and I cannot define you what your words meant. Everytime its like, unfolding someone whom we lost in our journey knowingly and obviously unknowingly. <br>God give you strength Brother. <br>You were an inspiration and will always be. In this difficult time, may be I cannot wear your shoes, but I atleast say, you will definitely be fine soon . <br>Take care of yourself brother. ❤️

RIP BB parents
The latest shocking news of bhuvan&#39;s parents made me listen to this song again 🥺❤️🙏 May their soul rest in peace ☮️ we love you bam ❤️
It&#39;s makes me cry
man stop it i can&#39;t watch it . it touch&#39;s soul !
I used to listen to this song, Don&#39;t know why I felt so connected with this didn&#39;t knew that I&#39;m gonna lose my dad😭😭😭😭😭😭
My father is living but whenever I listen to this song I feel lonely
Midnight , feeling lonely , take earphone and listen Rahguzar . I literally cried while listening it 😭😭😭😭
I can&#39;t get out of this song ❤️
Bhuvan is my favourite singer ❤️😍
I love this song it gave&#39;s me goosebumps ❤️
Dad’s are a blessing, never hurt, disrespect or ignore your Dad! ✌️❤️
In my opinion, this is BBs best and most underrated single. I have been listening to this song for the past 6 months and every time it comes up, I play it atleast twice. This is hands down my favorite song and gives me chills every time I listen to it.
Hey BB, can you release a whole album? I would honestly love to hear more from you.
Can&#39;t believe this is least music video of BB even tho it is prolly the best
Heer and ranjha gets 2.2m and this JUST 5 lakhs harsh truth
Jab tumhare relatives marte hai itna bhi nahi rote log par jab tumhare khud ke parents marte hai to Bahut bura lagta hai bahut 🥺😣
2 years of rahguzar,this song still made my eyes full of tears🔥🤧
Apne mom dad se baate karo...time spend karo...mom dad ke chehre dekhna gaur se..aur sochna kitni sundar pyaara Masum chehra hai... dosto k liye mom dad ko kabhi ignore mat karna... akhri saans tak mom dad hi rahenge pas mei...koi dost babu sona nhi rahega...ya Allah sabhi mom dad ko lambi umar dein❤️❤️
So at last it shows that bhuvan is that boy , right?
😭😭😭so emotinal
I&#39;m so unlucky, that it was recommended after 2yra
We may have a lot of commitments..but spending some time with ones who spend their life time for us, should be our priority.<br><br>We never know what is gonna happen the next moment, when we meet those people for the last time. <br>A deal of crores can wait but not the time. NEVER KEEP REGRET. LIVE IN THE MOMENT. SPEND TIME WITH THE PEOPLE WITHOUT WHOM YOU DON&#39;T HAVE EXISTANCE.
I am watch this song 2021 miss my papa 🥺🥺
Best
Best
Bro made u made me cry yar😭😭😭<br>Really

I don&#39;t know why there are 27K dislikes. It&#39;s based on emotions and no vulgar words are present in this song

This man....bro m speechless🥺
NEVER CUT A CALL BEFORE RECEIVING 👍<br><br>GREAT MESSAGE
U r multitalented BB!!!!
Deep really deep message very few would be able to get to it he wants to express that when a close one are with us we don&#39;t bother to give value to them or respect to them but we forgot that what we are today are just because of them we realise the value of them once we lose them at that moment it&#39;s useless to regret so always pay gratitude to your parents be thankful of their generosity live every moment with them and remember that what you are today is the gathering of their sacrifices at least have some decency that when they need  you , you should be there because once you need them 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Bro you deserve more suscribers than any indian youtuber. I&#39;ve watched all ur videos. You&#39;re amazing bro. What you do is.... Something that only you can do.

Kya Gaya hai Bhai ❤️😍❤️😍
Love you bro . You are next level guy.
Finally 20M subs. Congratulations BB
Imagine putting this last part in a fanfest
Am I wrong in thinking that the people in black symbolise his regrets? His regrets lead to memories - which is why all of them turn towards the child - then the small chest pain - back to present regrets and thus so on? And at the end, all this regrets engulf him. I am really curious. They are turning front and back - it is symbolic, isn&#39;t it?
💓💓
I wish I could like it thousand times not only once❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ talent is seriously overflowing out of this man .... BB is Love ❤️
Voice of 💖
Teary eyes....😍 BB my Father is still alive for God sake.I want my parents to be Happy Always at any cost.<br><br>Lovely song😍

Miss you papa 😔
Kuch bhi ho baap hmesha muskura hi dete. 1.35 <br><br>Dads are the best thing in this world ❤️
i never hugged my father, i never told my mom and dad that how much i love them...i never share my pain with my mom and dad..may be i am shy to talk with them,share my feelings with them or openly share my emotions... <br>But allah knows how much i love them,how much i care for them...
Plz support

It&#39;s incredible to be honest. Where our mainstream artists (be it bollywood or pop) are simply reduced to bunch of commercial sell outs, here&#39;s a man who is not even a full time pro singer ( but an incredible comedian) tell such a beautiful, simple yet moving story through the music and the video is simply mind-blowing. Our music industry needs to relearn this simple effective power of innocent stories. Only then can we regain the lost glory of the golden days. Keep going BB!
ohhh 😭😭😭
Hi
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I dedicate this song to my mom for what she did for me ..
Love you bb💝
It gives me goosebumps in the end🥺🥺
If your father dies , then you lost the umbrella upon you !
