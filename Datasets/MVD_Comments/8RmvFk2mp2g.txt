Ok
I only hated ugly notch on the OnePlus 7T. I still love full screen Oneplus 7T Pro Mclaren Edition
They Settled!
Watching this again nice video...
The best looking device OnePlus has ever made, I&#39;m having nightmares about the 10 Pro...
Watching from my OnePlus 7T and proud to have this ultimate device
O 😎 and advise for the same as the same
Naughty naughty ;-)
Just the intro deserves a dislike - stupid Lou
😍😍
Hmm... yes now as one plus has established itself as a brand globally &amp; built a huge customer fanboy base they have become greedy.<br>The OP 3, 5 &amp; 6 series was outstanding &amp; really flagship killer, they almost destroyed iphone 7&amp;8 series &amp; stole lot of iphone users. One plus 7T was their last value for money phone with everything from excellent build quality, snappy fast performance to good cameras &amp; display all under good 35k budget.<br><br>One plus 8 &amp; 9 series is totally OverHyped and Overpriced!
This phone was one of the first to have Android 10 out of the box and is now on course to be one of the last devices to get the Android 11 update🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Andi andii💓
I just bought this phone 📱 yeahh
Gl
So if i buy a 7T will i get this box
What watch do you wear?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=343">5:43</a> what`s that???
After 8T LAUNCH ... I got this in my recommendation.
can you suggest me the best phone under 25k in today&#39;s date! My main focus would be on the camera and the storage. I am not much of a gamer but I need a good camera to click a lot of pictures and record videos using both front and back camera! Please help me out by suggesting one!
Is this a special edition box or do all 7t Pro&#39;s come like this?
What&#39;s the name of the tune @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=431">7:11</a>? Please share link.
Still the best phone

Watching in my OnePlus 7t
P
If you turn all your high quality studio lights and lower the brightness of your phone then you&#39;ll notice something on your screen that no one is talking about.    Only making fun videos is not enough, you&#39;re just misguiding not your audience but people who will buy OnePlus 7t after watching your video )
Best reaction in few second about the box
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=138">2:18</a> he became horny<br>Yeaah😂😂
Can I get a “never settle” sticker? 😅
How come i only got that long box and and no bigass box
I got this phone for 240$$ out the door at TMobile such a great deal for all the features
If the price is right...
From which website should I order the phone❓❓
Dude please start recording in 16:9
the box goes spread eagle
Is the box standard? Just ordered this phone for my girlfriend. And unsure weather or not to buy her a case or headphones
Right into it 🤣
Oneplus 7t or oneplus 7pro...which is better？
More hyped over the 7T pro than the 8 pro. Cheaper, better cameras and no hole punch cutout. Same warp 30T charging. Better deal right?
Is it just me? Or that box is literally orange not red.
good
Hey Lou. Is there a another social media platform to better message you? I still have the S9 plus and want to get a new phone. Should I get the  oneplus8?
Unbox the pro
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=96">1:36</a> no dude thats sharingan
The cat just chillin next to jacks macbook
My first phone was the one plus seven pro and I have no interest in changing brand any time soon
Any thoughts on One Plus 8 Pro?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=135">2:15</a> My reaction when i mastrubated first time😆😆
Wish I could have seen what the selfies look like with this phone
Is the nightscape showed on the video only for reviewers or does the phone really bring it?
TBH This OnePlus or TwoPlus company have Zero Innovation  Zeeeroooooo....
Do Europeans and Americans Also Like Chinese Mobile Phones?
Oneplus : the power you need<br>Apple : the money we need
awesome
The speaker in OnePlus 7T IS better than iPhone 11 Pro (Max). Because of the dedicated loudspeaker beside the earpiece.
What a phone 🤘🤟👌👌👌👌
Please review these problem on your channel OnePlus donot value it customer
I had worst experience with 7 pro the fast charging suddenly stop working and phone automatically crash there service for repair phone is worst I think it was worst to decision to buy this 7 pro because there donot have service store to repair the phone
who else paused the video to solve the maze
Hi guys! Can you recommend a phone ranging from $400- $500 with good specs?
My oneplus 7t didn&#39;t come with that box
did anyone notice &quot;I became a dog 2&quot; soundtrack?
How come everyone who bought 7T got that kind of big box<br><br>Edit: nevermind, this isn&#39;t retail packaging
FROM DA PROFILE?! 🤣
Mine should come tomorrow. Tbh ill probably have more fun with macro than night mode.
Does every phone come with all that?? Nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=36">0:36</a> like a virgin
Awesome man....💖
So did you just get that big box cause you do reviews? I know i didnt get that big ass box when i got mine from T-Mobile...  Or maybe that skinny little mutant at the store jacked me  and only gave me the box the phone came in.
It&#39;s back glass shattered during durability tests.
Wtf? Is that other dude an Asian Ari Shaffir?!
Air dropnis better than pop up if yes like
Why you and the other reviewers do not talk about how slow and poorly the oneplus phones are being updated? I mean, come on, a 600EUR phone to not get a monthly security patch update? I have a 7T and still no sign of any update. P.S. I&#39;m on the November<br>2019 security patch. I specifically bought the 7T because of the software support that it suppoused to get. What a hoax of a company
Smooth😂😂
90 hz or higher displays are probably the most useless &quot;innovation&quot; in recent phones.
&quot;similar but different&quot;<br>nice
Fucking t mobile just gave me the phone box that&#39;s it
this guy is brand ambassador of &quot;never settle&quot; except he forgot it was about only one brand

Big box full of paper to justify big price
Contemplating one of these because there&#39;s a 5g variant for t mobile.
My screen cracked right at the top for no reason whatsoever. Right in front of the front-facing cam. No warranty and the guy I bought it from wanted about 250 USD to replace the entire display. It&#39;s been just 2 months since I bought the device. Tried to contact OnePlus support - no response. Been wanting to own a OnePlus since their 1st device but now I wish I just stuck to my Iphone SE :(
12 GB RAM in OnePlus 7? <br><br>My PC has left the chat
Isnt technicly ALWAYS plus bc of the name One&quot;Plus&quot; ;)
Anybody else pause and do the maze?
In our place we dont get that big box just the phone <br>@sangeetamobiles
It’s faster charging due to smaller battery *
Total shit.

After using for a month...<br><br><b>Very hard to watch porn at the same time</b>
Hi sir how are you <br>I want to purchase a new mobile which one can you personally prefer to purchase <br>In my mind to mobiles<br>Samsung s9 plus and OnePlus 7t
This is a good review but I think you should mention one BIG limitation of the camera. The selfie / front camera has no zoom. It is fixed, take it or leave it. This is the only thing I don&#39;t like about this phone, my phone.
Did I miss it or that thing doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack?
During the audio test around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=405">6:45</a>.  Honestly, the iPhone 11 sounds bad.

Can&#39;t focus on the review because of will&#39;s dog :D
Hey Lou.  I am a big fan of yours and I have using the Umidigi Power as my daily driver for a year now and I love this phone. I was a big One Plus guy being one of the chosen to buy the One Plus One when it first came out but I really think Umidigi is bringing something awesome to the smartphone market that is worth every penny for people like me on a major budget. Thanks for the awesome informative videos you produce.
👍👍👍
I like pop-up generation, &amp; i have it
One plus 7t . 😍😍🥰🥰🤩🤩🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
When I heard Willy Du in the beginning, I thought I clicked on a Soldier Knows Best video
Hi guys.  <br><br>Just wondering. When you insert your SIM cards. Do you leave your phone on or off.  Does it have to be turned off or
I think you forgot to mentioned that this phone does not have notification LED. It very handy feature and should have been covered.<br>Please include this for all of your future videos, Thanks
How can I buy this huge red box ?
Hi guys.  I just bought my 7t less than an hour ago.  $680 cash, Canadian funds. Blue as well.  Looking forward to playing around with it<br><br>No 7t pro since I don’t like having a mechanical pop up selfie camera
Yo
Watching on OnePlus 7 Pro I have to say I love this phone
$100 at one point was not &quot;budget minded&quot; earbuds at all. Why is the world this way.
Lier you still using your 1+ 7
Where is the beard test?
Why is no one talking about how cute that dog is??
Looking to get a one plus 7 pro or 7t, any advice which one I should get? I&#39;m a Heavy music, YouTube, gamer and pics user.
The shoulder on the model looks like a titty...
What about the selfie mode?
Bruh i phone sucks
It&#39;s brilliant 10/10
I&#39;m debating between the OnePlus 7t and the realme x2 pro. Realme is cheaper, has headphone jack, faster charging, and barely better performance. OnePlus has better software and is more US friendly. Any thoughts?
i have my 7t pro and im so fck happy with this phone
I prefer the pop up camera cuz the whole phone being a screen just looks nicer

Unbox the one plus 7t pro mclaren edition
So awesome having the other guy in the vid really adds to the productions also it was cool you showed the reviewer guide!
Hey ALL, finally got my flagship oneplus 7T the 8GB ram,  256G storage edition. But damn I experience some horrible issue, while typing both with gboard and SwiftKey, I get a decent amount of typos, even on cheaper pocophone I didn&#39;t have such terrible accuracy on keyboard touch sensors. Oneplus has any plans fixing this?
I love this more than I phone, but why did that go down on front face from 16 to 12 mxp on the OnePlus 7T this almost makes me want to get the OnePlus 7 for the front face.
Cute dog ugly phone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=229">3:49</a> at extreme right hand side , I was scared first

Face unlock reaction make me laugh 😂

Why am I watching this when I have a samsung galaxy s10 plus?
Can I use this phone with Verizon wireless?
How do you buy oneplus phones
Can you give to me...
Watching this on one plus 7t 😂
UPDATE: Approximately one week later, the proximity sensor is acting up all the time now. Tap to wake and lift to wake don&#39;t work when I pull the phone out of my pocket. Also, I&#39;ve noticed a couple more annoying issues: 1) the volume rocker changes media volume by default instead of ring volume. So if you on your home screen and try to volume up/down, it change media volume even if media isn&#39;t playing at the time. You also can&#39;t adjust volume from lock screen. 2) if you&#39;re listening to Google play, you can&#39;t play/pause or change track from the lock screen. Really annoying. <br><br>I&#39;ve had this phone for almost 2 weeks. As much as I want to love it, there are some really frustrating things that have me considering a return:<br>1) Touch to wake and ambient display don&#39;t work with a screen protector on. I&#39;ve tried glass, matte, and clear. They all cause issues. I&#39;ve read that it has something to do with where these sensors are located (directly below the notch). So no screen protector it is I guess. <br>2) Not compatible with Fitbit. <br>3) Android auto issues. If I connect the phone to my car to use the in-car display for navigation, Waze doesn&#39;t work. It tells me I have to open the app on my phone first, which it won&#39;t let me do when the phone is connected. Waze works fine when it&#39;s not connected to my car. Google Maps does seem to work via Android auto though.<br>3) If you&#39;re in a social media app and the first two posts in the timeline are videos, the one at the very top doesn&#39;t auto play.  Instead, the second post will start auto playing because it&#39;s in the middle of the screen. The only way to get the top post to play is to click into the actual post. The video can&#39;t be viewed from the timeline because you can&#39;t drag it down into the right zone. <br>4) Can&#39;t dismiss or preview notifications from the &quot;first&quot; lock screen (if you have face unlock enabled). <br>5) Weather info doesn&#39;t display on lock screen.<br>6) SMS notification sounds weren&#39;t working until I set the native messaging app as the default.<br><br>If anyone knows how to solve any of these issues, I&#39;d be interested to learn.
Let&#39;s jump into &#39;it&#39; being the box XD<br><br>Gonna smash the phone be4 unboxing it LOL<br><br>Um, I still prefer the OnePlus 7 Pro over just the 7T cuz 7 Pro has no notch, smooth 90Hz, as well as a larger battery. The only reason I&#39;d go for the 7T is just the fast processor being Snapdragon 855+ ;)<br><br>Honestly, the best thing about the 7T is just the price and a faster processor being Snapdragon 855+, making it one of the best smartphones between mid-range and flagship smartphones :)
Bhai log ek rikvest hai mai oneplus               7T lu ya nahi pleasesssssssssss batov plssss
i have OP 7T. i buy this before a week. it was hanging and freezing.what i do. don&#39;t know what is OnePlus doing.
Hi unbox therapy...<br>What watch is Lewis wearing?<br>It looks really cool 😁
What the fuck is that dog upto?
Wasn&#39;t mentioned:<br>1. No support for Qualcomm Quick Charge. Now, before you guys all start with &quot;but warp is so fast&quot; . Try charging a OnePlus with a powerbank.  It&#39;s slow. Why? No QC support.<br>2. Screen is just 1080p. Sure, it&#39;s ok, but it&#39;s not great. I would have liked to see it up close next to the OnePlus 7 Pro .<br>3. Still very unclear the whole water resistance.
unbox process not appreciate product at all, attitude/behaviour has decided the review is bad. Waste of time no point at all this review.
I have no idea why no matter how good One Plus phones sound I&#39;m so nervous to buy one. I do however love my Pixel 3a
No jack👎
Whoooooooo
Who else did the maze 😂😎
Watching it on the One Plus 7T
Could you check out the Realme X2 Pro which is the newest flagship killer in the market?
Doggo I can&#39;t take my eyes of it
Where can i order like you bro like mobile full kit  in previous video asus rog 2 phone and black shark 2 pro fully accessories kit tell me website
BUt doEs It haVe a heaDPhoNe jAck ThO?
amazing phone... better than apple...
Great Phone, bought it two days ago. Dont like the design of the camera on the back but besides that i can&#39;t complain, one of the best phone i ever had/have, beautiful 90hz display, great speakers, very easy to optimize the everything with android 10 and all the New Features and so on... Didn&#39;t want to go for the 7 pro because i&#39;m not a fan of pop up cameras as my Xiaomi mi 9 t pro has and zenfone 6 even if its not really a &quot;pop up&quot;. really recommend oneplus 7T.
The guy with the dog should be in all the videos
Oreo, you dip it, you eat it NOW it&#39;s on the f@$king phone!!😂 for sure i&#39;m gonna get one 👍
Unbox realme x2 pro, might be the next  flagship killer
Nice phone pal
Watching this on my OnePlus 7T
you should review my phone,  a lg phoenix 3
You got a MUCH larger box and a LOT more stuff in your box than I did in mine from T-Mobile! LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=476">7:56</a> when your mom walks in on you watching xnxx
What watch is that you&#39;re wearing???
Apple... who???
This phone sucks, the speaker stopped working after 15 days
When are you going to unbox the one plus tv
Dude you just leveled up your game like a month ago. I think you are the best reviewer on youtube. Keep it up. Keep being honest.
Whats with that black hole...
^^^^^@@@@@ PLEASE REVIEW REALME X2 PRO They promise its the FLAGSHIP that has massive 64Mega Pixel Camera and 20x Hybrid Zoom! --- Lewi PLEASE!
This phone is nice ...<br>But few months ago, I accidentally dropped my phone from my study table.<br>My study table is just &#39;50&#39; feet high...even it didn&#39;t survived...<br>Now I am using my Nokia keypad.
855+
Confused btwn oneplus7t and 7pro😫
They have updated the access card for H2 OS. that&#39;s such a life-saver function
The one plus 7T phone is not compatible with Verizon. I picked one up at the 7T pop up store last Friday and still can’t get it to work with Verizon.
Apple makes shit so at the moment Nokia 3310 is better than new iPhone 🤷🏻‍♂️
What comes in the box if I buy it with my carrier?
Oneplus 7t screen is flickering. That is caught by the camera if you see it. Even other reviers like GEEKYRANJIT mentioned this problem in their review.
That box alone is probably a quarter of the total price.
How about an honest review on mi note 8 pro ?
Performance + Design = OnePlus 5t, still strives in the year 2019.

how to get that full box set ?
Can i have some smartphone you have?? I really need it badly 👆🏻😩😩😩
Try Realme X2 pro ........
Guys I am a small YouTuber please help me reach 50 subs<br>I post gameplays<br>Please it&#39;s a kind request
Hahahahahaha 😂🤣🤬 what to say now “profile” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You surprised me, <br>you achieved something...<br><br>Next time.....<br><br>Your F*<b>*</b> me<br>You achieved something...<br><br>The fake Godfather of OnePlus...😂🤣😂🤣<br>OnePlus 7 was better than this.
I can buy the 7 for 488 and the 7t for 599 in my country, so what would your choice be in comparisend with the prices
starts at $599? wow, that&#39;s quite more expensive than China mainland.
You&#39;re gonna need some unbox therapy of your own after this I think.  That reaction.... just... &quot;There are meetings that take place... WOOOOHOHOHO THEY GOT ME!&quot;
Price??
Hi does they really give such a big box??
hoping that the price you saying that are in malaysia ringgit and i can afford that
Compare with Asus ROG phone 2
I hope all of us have the same phone<br>pls give me plsss
No one knows why this had so many likes
I love this channel, well done guys. I&#39;m looking for a new phone and my biggest issue is determining info about the front facing cameras. I travel full-time and am looking for the idea phone for minimalist vlogging. Seeing the image for framing that a front facing allows is important to me. I have had my eye on the Asus Zenfone 6/6Z but had a challenge finding one due to branding issues in India where I have been lately. I&#39;m looking for suggestions for which phone would work best for my requirements. I like to have the power in the phone to edit since I don&#39;t like to carry a laptop these days. Thanks for any tips.
Giveaways?
You didn&#39;t do selfie test that famous beard test I know why because it would have failed miserably.<br>All OnePlus phones captures blurry selfie and its due to aggressive skin  smoothening effect even when you turned off beautification mode completely.
aaaahhhhhh 😂😂😂👌
Heared,<br> OP7 pro&#39;s sound, it&#39;s good<br> OP7t&#39;s, it&#39;s better<br> iPhone 11 pro max&#39;s, it&#39;s bullshit
Wow!This box has a flying door.😂
I don&#39;t understand why they have a notch when there is a bezel at the bottom. They could have just pushed the screen to the bottom and had the bezel at the top so that no any protruding notches needed. iPhone X have notch because they don&#39;t have any bezel but these android phones which copy iPhone introduce notches  just to show the world that they are stupids, idiots and complete fools in designing. <br>Not only this phone 99% of android phones have the same design - notch at the top and bezel at the bottom. how idiotic these android phones are..! and no reviewer talks about this fact
Notification light?
the camera looks pretty bad and inconsistent WB across 3 lens, in this very controlled environment. and the Halo of that portrait mode is quite ridiculous. Seems 9t pro is a better choice with cheaper price.
what no jack...thats sucks
Great unboxing review!.. but my OP6T is still a beast of a phone to this day =) .. probably won&#39;t be upgrading til OP9T.
How did you take night mode photo
Please make a video review on realme Pro 5 and realme XT
I just wish in 2020 some company will release a phone that are just nice in the hand like iphone 5 and have 99% stb ratio with a pop up camera.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=180">3:00</a>, I was like &#39;jist fucking show me the phone! What is it? Suspense drama?
I can&#39;t believe people are still getting so hyped for a phone as average, boring and crap like a Crap Plus phone... Blows my mind.
appreciate the camera analysis, but take the bastard outside and give those pixels real world light and dark. enough of this controlled studio lighting mockery.
Holy moly this dog lokks like a fox
A guy flying<br>Will: so he went up -_-<br><b>This guy is never satisfied nor pleased</b>
How can i get the whole box
Everyone can see that setting sign on top left side. It doesn&#39;t go. And lots of software issue. Don&#39;t buy. After 3 days usage review.
Ugly camera , ugly notch ... I&#39;ll stick with my 7 Pro
Am i the only one that thinks that the 7t ‘s camera looks like a Motorola camera
You forgot to show us three different colored Phone case that was also came in that box... You just showed 4th transparent case.
SONY: Releases Xperia 1, Xperia 5 with 21:9 aspect ratio display.....<br>Reviewers: Weird aspect ratio, Impractical aspect ratio, Unusable etc etc etc.....<br><br><br>Oneplus: Releases Oneplus 7T with 20:9 aspect ratio display.<br>Reviewers: Best phone, Best display, Best blah blah blah blah......<br><br>STOP BEING BIASED KIDS.

That book so big they look like they used a whole tree 🌲
“YEEEEEEAAAAH” 😂
Still using Xiaomi Mi A1 🤣<br>But capturing good photos than others 🤣🤣🤣🖕
One Plus has come a long way in 5+ years and getting too expensive for my budget.<br>I would really appreciate it if you would do a review on the new K Touch i10 mini smartphone. Something I am very interested in.<br>Also check out the Umidigi Power which is now my daily driver.
Hey guys, I got my very first OnePlus 7T. After watching so many unboxing reviews, I keep my hopes high. Without 3.5mm jack, I was pity sure that I will be getting a adapter or a bullet wireless 2 at least, even though the OnePlus is not providing any sandstone back cover ( this is the most prominent feature of OnePlus one that keeps it apart from other shits , but as we know if u fly high or high enough, u forget ur roots...).<br><br><br>but ..<br>....<br>.....<br>it all went in vain.<br><br>If anyone agrees, do support this thread .. otherwise.. with this speed.. our OnePlus is reaching escape velocity and will soon leave or loose it&#39;s existence.. it is becoming flagship with no utility friendly.. a flagship killer with no hardware friendliness.
iPhone 11 Pro Max or OnePlus 7T?
yes bring back the straight edge. NO not the teardrop :( - 6T user
Lewwwww!!!!!!! What knife is that and where can I get one?! 😄
you got to review the DOG!
Overpackaged much?
Fake advertising
ugly camERA
Bit of a shame that every camera mode (or lens) also give different colors.
Should I go for the Frosted Silver one or the Glacier Blue one?
This is a amazing phone you no
Then theres me over here still using the Samsung Galaxy S8 😂
More like 650$
Wow. Incredible waste of paper. I was almost expecting a pair of basketball shoes in there. That box could have been 1/4 the size.
What about OnePlus tv?!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=305">5:05</a> willydo agrees

Why don&#39;t you do tech talks
Unbox realme XT 16k Rupee/20k rupee phone with 64mp quad camera AMOLED display fast charger inside the box snapdragon 712
I thought it was a laptop.
How do I get a big ass box like this one??
nice Huawei phone
I&#39;m never gonna throw box of this phone. So beautiful. 😭😍
Hello can you do review of OnePlus TV
Where can you purchase this bundle box? From their website? And what is the name of the bundle or did they make it only for Unbox Therapy?
It looks like Nokia Lumia 1020. So new design experience))
Hey Lew still waiting on that Galaxy Note 10+ review<br>It&#39;s been way longer than a month month man!!!
Do an u boxing of the MI mix phone<br>It has the best rated camera
are we all ignoring the fact that this looks similar &amp; a copy of Mate 30 pro?
Stop showing Willie in the video frequently. It&#39;s a one-man show.
Which one is worth buying in oct 2019, redmi k20 pro 6gb 128gb or poco f1 8gb 256gb, will be using new one for 2 years atleast, please suggest
iphone or 1plus ?
Sr, how do you do to get the notification of missed called into your OP 7 pro??? I can&#39;t get it..
Idiot stream
I love android because of all the choices but galaxy will always have me with the infinity display.
That&#39;s my next phone. Im a big fan of One Plus
Right in there!!😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=134">2:14</a> Im high so this was next level
are they going to give that box to every customer?
I think OPPO holds the fastest i think with SuperVOOC 50w of power
Just give me your old OnePlus I buy it
The speaker is loud is loud AF
No other reviewer spent much time on each item in that box as Lew and I liked it
I miss Jack
We like the way you talk, but over time you got a bias against Apple even if they do good. They didn&#39;t invite you to the event. That&#39;s not personal. I&#39;m going to unsubscribe

Why you didn&#39;t talk about the headset that inside the box 😭
I like the lack of curved screen
90hz is easy to show on camera all you do is slow the video down
Is it just me or does anyone else find themselves thinking &quot;just get to the unboxing&quot; nowadays?
Mao the box is red but it looks orange coz this dumbass can&#39;t color correct for shit lmao
Why did they bring back the notch
How&#39;s the speaker quality??
I just love how entertaining unbox therapy is haha
How the fuck is the Asian boy who looks at you during the entire video
can you unbox the oneplus tv
From where did I buy this big box ? Actually I can&#39;t find!!
Can i have this one??
Are we just gonna breeze over the fact that my man has a fucking fox on his lap at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=267">4:27</a>?
Broo plzz Unbox One Plus TV
Im in love
The time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=420">7:00</a> u have the phone label wrong
Just wow!
What about Oneplus Tv?? Not reviewing that?? . Its strange that amazon in india is selling the 7t and Tv both. But no user review has been posted so far.  Not even on Facebook.  Is it so that they are not selling these like they expected or can they delete user reviews?
So now unboxing smartphone nowabays, the surprise is from the unboxing not the phone
They give you SO MUCH when you compare to Apple.
Can you review the new turtle beach elite atlas wireless for PC!??
Otg? Displayport alternate mode? Miracast?
Too bad I’m broke
lease, oh please. I know it&#39;s not a popular phone company in North America compared to Samsung, Xiaomi, Apple and some others.  But LEW!!!!!  Unbox the new Umidgi F2 and Umidgi X.  Can these really be the flagship killers of our dreams.  and if for some reason they take up too much space in the studio please do a drawing to have them. I am a disabled veteran on VA disability pension every month and would love the ability to have a nice phone like this.  I for so long wanted a pixel 3xl, or a galaxy fold when I heard of it.  but never can afford the prices.  the prices of these seem amazing and I would let me to hear your take on these two magnificent on paper sounding phones.  Thanx Lew!!
hey lou, do you recommend between the onplus 7 5g and note 10 or s10 to change from S9???
Video time 911 🤔😲<br>👇🏾
I just got a small box was expecting this typ of box 😔😔😔

Iphone 8 gang

just here to write this: mate30pro 5g has 28 antenas! alsp has 4500mah battery, op7pro has 4000mah, yet somehow mate30pro is smaller and lighter. you just need to admire huawei state of technology.
Note 10 plus full review pleaaaseee!!!

Bro plz reply<br>Can I use 3.5mm earphone jack by using dongle in 1+7t?<br>Plz reply
Nobody gonna talk about Will’s pupperino?
Boy is watching on a 7 pro
I want to Visit Pompsy Gang!! wheres the website!
Love how Will just: Mmm… yeah..mm. And is just trying to say i dont care.
I want that Unbox Therapy pocket knife🤤🤤
Lew can you do an unboxing video on the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha?
7 pro is better looking
Why doesnt oneplus send &quot;that box&quot; when I buy a phone
Asus rog 2 indian Price 38k &amp;7t price 38k asus rog best better than OnePlus bye bye OnePlus
Hit like who think dark background is better than bright lighting
still uisng apple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=100">1:40</a>
It&#39;s just another normal OnePlus phone. Not as spectacular as the Pro. Chill out guys.
Lol looks like OnePlus paid lue......
You forgot to take a selfie
send me it
REVIEW XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 8 PRO.<br>It has quad camera 64megapixels.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=480">8:00</a> aaaahhh, waka waka ....
Best phone I&#39;ve ever seen in youtube😂<br>Wish someone give me this😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=133">2:13</a> this turned into MuchDank real quick 😂😂😂
The unboxthrrapy videos should now really come with a mention in the title about the timestamp from which the speaker will start making sense.
Very soon to be used for shooting movies too.
Can&#39;t packaging be minimal? <br>All the paperwork is waste,should be done online.
Dogggooooooo 😍
I kind of like that Will is included in the videos now. Now that his limited responses are put up next Lew&#39;s exaggerated ones, it feels less like Lew is talking to the void behind his camera. It creates a nice representation of content creators that make this show.
Fuck u
Do every 1+ 7t come with that kind of box?
When u buy the phone does it come with all those<br> stuff or do u pay more for it
It looks like an average motorola from behind.
whhhhhhhyyyyyyyy did they put that baaaaaack
redmi k20 pro
That custom knife is badass, wheres it from
The OP6 is the nicest phone I&#39;ve ever owned and tbh, I&#39;m glad it doesn&#39;t have wireless charging. I Love the &quot;dash&quot; charging. It makes me feel like EVERYTHING with a battery should charge that fast.
no one gonna talk about the cute dog sitting with will?
Will and Lew, everything was perfect about this video - music, unboxing experience, Lew being tacky, the meme content, the no-frills feature listing.
I like how the  video ends at 9/11
Why dont u unbox infinix and tecno phones?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=239">03:59</a><br>When you see it, you&#39;ll shit bricks!!!
Holding onto my Op7 Pro until the 8, skipping the T this cycle.
This dude with the dog does not make any sense.
this is definetly a iphone 11 killer
Why does Will have a pet fox? Jk cute pupper
You should check Realme XT
That camera looks like the back of an Apple Watch
I personally don’t like the circular spot. Rather have rounded edges
Please do a review on the Wireless bullets 😍
The video is <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=551">9:11</a></b> minutes long
Is this every single one or is it a special reviewers guide
where&#39;s the pro version at?
Is one plus 7t pro coming in India ??? As it is launching in  London on 10 oct
<b>Late 90&#39;s in future we&#39;ll have flying car</b> <br><br><br><br><b>Reality - phone&#39;s camera changes like stove and washing machine</b>
Unnecessary paper usage. That first book/guide has huge font. Just because of that noone should buy it.
Why only camera and speaker is a major thing for unbox therapy. It&#39;s  not a detailed information.
I freaking forgot to breathe when y&#39;all didn&#39;t show Lew exhale. It was so loud, I thought I inhaled as well
859<br>Size 14
<b>REASONS TO BUY ONEPLUS 7T OVER ROG PHONE 2</b> :<br><br>1. <b>DESIGN</b> : it’s very sleek,elegant and premium in hands. Some may not like camera module design....but I don’t mind it at all.<br><br>2. <b>LIGHTWEIGHT</b> : very light(190 grams )compared to rog 2 (240 grams ). Rog 2 is Very uncomfortable for day to day use and restricts one hand use.<br><br>3. <b>OXYGEN OS</b> :(comes with android 10 and provides quick updates) hands down best UI compared to UI in asus. oxygen UI is simple and solid whereas the the ROG UI feels cheap due to too many skins and customisations it provides.<br><br>4. <b>CAMERA</b> : better camera. Oneplus have nailed it this time. Rog 2 cameras are not bad though.<br><br>5. <b>SPLASH AND DUST RESSISTANCE</b> : Has lot of ports without any rubber protection. Only God knows what will happen when the phone meets water. I would recommend to wait any water test  coz it doesn’t feel protected against dust and water at all.<br><br>6. <b>DISPLAY</b> : it has a very small drop notch which looks V.good compared to those big bezels on the ROG 2. C,mon It’s 2019 guys(bezel less era). It may not be a big deal to some but you’ll realise in the future run. And there isn’t a big difference between the 90hz and 120hz  when it comes to casual use.<br><br>7. <b>AFTERSALE SERVICE</b> : oneplus service is  just too good and reliable. They are very transparent.<br><br>8. <b>BRAND VALUE</b> : Oneplus is Oneplus :)<br><br>......But if are a gamer or a person who wants a big battery ...go for ASUS ROG 2....for others it’s the 7T
Gamers don&#39;t buy this<br>ASUS ROG 2 is beast compared to one plus 7T
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=180">3:00</a> start

Pls
Pls

Pls
1984 olympics los angeles i believe..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=241">4:01</a> OnePlus stop making the charging faster! I don&#39;t want to be able to charge in 10 minutes. Are you gonna make a 50 watt one day??? no one needs that - most ppl charge at night anyway. I bet you more ppl would be happy if the battery was over 4000mAh, and if the phone had AI to conserve battery. I would much rather take a bigger battery and WIRELESS charging and an AVERAGE fast charger in the box than this.
Please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who paused the video on the maze just to try running it with my eyes. PLEASE!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=155">2:35</a> that dog first appeared like fox.
Is the front camera of oneplus 7t better than oneplus 7 ??
does this phone come with this box and packaging ?
In 2056, Camera&#39;s are going to be 1 pixel big.........Probably
I prefer my big Nokia old 😂
No more  ccp
That&#39;s drop notch
Ugh that iPhone was so WIDE lol
Dark green colour would be nice
Do we get the wireless earphones with the phone??
Why it&#39;s like thin and long
FUNNY SOUNDS. 😆😁😄😅😅
Sub to my channel:(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=349">5:49</a> 🤣🤣🤣
anybody has any input regarding the video/sound comparison segment? i&#39;d appreciate if a pro could be so kind as to give us the breakdown, cheers!
So we r not gonna talk about the cutest puppy in the world sitting next to Will???
a phone should not be more than 200$ whatever it is
Who else noticed the piano playing?
Very bad experience with OnePlus 7 pro waste of money instead I have buy note 10
If without notch, I would have bought it straight

expecting more dog cameos
That&#39;s the UNBOX Therapy I know.
The only thing one plus is doing by providing all the boxes and stuffs is that they are wasting a hell lot of papers 😑
Next one plus video: DON&#39;T buy the one plus 7T
Why is the date 25 September when the phone launched on 26th ??
One plus is the only company doing everything right. Great flagship, affordable price as usual :)
“Never settle”
MISSED SELFIE TEST
Sir please please can you give me this phone I need a new phone I am from India an I can&#39;t afford to take new phone please help me and I am your biggest fan please can you give me this an I love oneplus 7T please sir please 🙏🙏
Lew your reviews are getting boring. Try to make them more interesting. I know it’s difficult but that a frank opinion

The I phone cameras look like  kitchen stove
Doesn&#39;t it become see saw when you put on table with giant camera. (Without back protection cover)
cant find out who owns this channel the asian or the white guy
Please tell MKBHD to keep background music running just like you do🙏
How many of you paused the video and tried to do the maze?
I want it to be full screen but okay;((
Im tryna like it but the back is just SO ugly😭😭😭
You will never do detail video about iPhone/apple products, but others always go dept and market..... cz these all options are 2015-16 old... and iPhone has 4X zoom and 30,000 dot projection face unlock and 1 trillion processes per second processor power too. DON&#39;T BUY OnePlus 7T too? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Get ROG 2 in that price
iPhone 11 pro max looks like it&#39;s a 90hz display because of the way Apple has refined the smooth animations. OnePlus resorting to 90hz to give the impression of a smoother phone is one way to do it, but it&#39;s ultimately kind of lazy. <br><br>I own a 6t and my cousin has a 11 pro max. Both are 60hz. iPhone looks infinitely smoother when scrolling and going back home with swipe gestures.
Nightmode on this phone is so good.
I have the 7 Pro but I&#39;m liking that macro
That cannot be the retail box
Best unboxing vids out there!
2019 the year for ugly ass phones smh
Fun fact: Note 10+ also has this “macro” photography feature. Just use the x2 optical zoom camera and it takes fantastic macro shots
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=38">0:38</a> you got me dude😂
No ... Nooo... The rog2 is there ...one plus finally lost..

Yeaaaah yeaaah😂
OnePlus Reduced price by not using a stylis pen and including a &quot;NOTE f*cking book&quot; 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Now you can use universal pen.. which has ink 🤣🤣🤣🤣
do  you known about oneplus7t pro
that camera setup is ugly af
Wait that&#39;s the actual box ??
To be honesty, it looks a little bit ugly.

1 + 70 = 71
wooshh love the knife, where can i get one ???
Yeah...! Today I owned it 1+ 7T 8/256 .. !!
Spend the extra $50 for the pro, theres no reason for the 7T to exist at that price
That’s really a lot of unnecessary paper
911 <br>If u know, u know
Am i the only oneplus fan who hates the T series. I mean I just bought the 7 pro and then they went to release the 7t which is cheaper with added features and arguably better cameras compared to 7 pro. Fuck this. I feel left out as a 7 pro owner
which glass is used at front and rear?
Xiaomi A3s already launched android 10 i think. 🤔🤔🤔
Hi bro how can I get a mobile box like you.
I cant wait for the oneplus 8t

There came the energy back
Hi Lew, if you wont switch to that, I&#39;d like to have that. Thank you.😁
iPhone 11 Pro audio sounds like crap.
7T wants u to open his legs and play with him 😂
Would we get headphones for 7t
Not a big fan of the circular cut-out. Looks like a Motorola

How ugly
Pls help me Should i go for oneplus 7 pro or oneplus 7t. Iam a gamer and love to click photos. So pls suggest me a oneplus phone. Love from india🇮🇳
I see... before now.. I only saw him talking crap about iPhones.. but now I see.. that it is just a character.. “talking crap about anything”. Just... “entertaining people”. 😊 whatever works for you mate.
It&#39;s called a teardrop notch because notches make you cry.
I think I&#39;m going to have to switch to an iPhone... These new Android phones are way too big for my liking. I wish OnePlus had kept the size of the 6T at least...
i can understand what you mean based on big difference and a slim difference but there no point launching a phone thats cost more money but its only included with little feature  therefore, its pointless to even have and only because a new phone came out, doesn&#39;t mean we should be excited when its practically the same thing
Bro the first OnePlus was literally 240 quid and it was way better than all the subsequent models
なんだか言語わからんが反応が面白いなあ<br><br><br><br><br>これが1500万人の力なんですね
That guy speaks like Dustin 😂😂
That little dog stole the show for me hahaha so cute
Did i just blink my eye when Lew was about to take the phone out
Anyone else pause it in the maze to do it
Do I need 3 Camera?<br>NO<br>DO I need headphone Jack? <br>Yes
7 is still neater
<b>onelus is like trump: make phone great again😂</b>
In mid 2019 you don&#39;t need OnePlus anymore. I was also hyped and bought a OnePlus 5T 2 years ago for almost $700 in my country. Now I understand that there are many better deals around $400 - 450, if you want flagship specs. User interfaces of the competitors got much better in 2019, almost everyone (xiaomi, Asus, honor, etc) can easily compete with overhyped Oxygen OS today. OnePlus used to be the best in terms of user interface and speed, but today other phones just catched and easily match OnePlus&#39;s level of performance. Therefore, no need to pay extra $200 for OnePlus brand, when you have flagship specs for $400. Also, the camera department did not improve since 2016. OnePlus honestly has one of the most mediocre cameras, there are also system bugs that happen time to time in my OnePlus 5t.
The background piano music was great can someone post the link here?
lew likes packaging so much lol
When he sniffs that notebook he should quote mhhmmmm! After.
Turn on subtitles and see The price of the 7t at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmvFk2mp2g&amp;t=286">4:46</a>
Can u do comparison between one plus 7t vs rog 2 because in India both r at 38k so which should i buy plz help
Welcome to trypophobia smartphone era..
October??
All the while he unknowingly  left his former OnePlus 7 Pro in the seat crack, as the dog is now chewing the crap out of it.
&quot;From the profile.. &quot;😆
Maybe one day when Android phones stop seeing a harsh degradation in performance (due to infrequent and eventually zero updates) and value after only a couple years... Until then, iPhone all the way baby
looks like huawei mate 30pro
Now a days Jack is also becoming Reviewer...😂 Started giving opinions with his style...🤩
Does any1 else has te urge to slam shup te macbook nd beat the shit out f his face..or is it jus me!!
That face unlock is incredible!!!! Literally instant! 🔥💜
You waste allot of time with bullshit. Just open it up and review the phone. Who cares how the box open and how it smells smh lol
One plus is an overrated priced shit
I would like to suggest to buy Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha. 😊 Newest release of xiaomi 😁
COMMENTS ARE BETTTER THAN VIDEO 🤣
I love the unboxing experience oneplus gives
What’s is the dog eating.
Oneplus:our phone&#39;s rear camera is 48mp.<br>Iphone:what the hell? iPhone11 pro have a triple camera but it&#39;s not 48mp. that&#39;s illegal
Does everybody gets this box or this was a special box for the show ? Bro u should be on netflix fr
love your dog
i thought he is roasting one plus
Who else paused the video to solve the maze ?😅
Nice
Honestly, the design of One+7 pro was far better. Curve design and pop-up looks cool. Nowadays, 100$ phones also offering notch like that.  Not a good move One+

Hey Lew, I know you get a lot of comments but I wanted to ask you about something, I have a android zte maven 2 and at school kids are bullying me about my phone, they take it from me and make fun of it, they scratch the screen and it&#39;s really annoying. I was just wondering could you help me?
I&#39;m going to say it once, it&#39;s called a Nipple Notch, get it right :D

What&#39;s best phone and laptop you think as winging this on here with a phone as laptop and 3 Phones  TV  router in a heap as opened door and tossed them out. Google and all they fuckers in the board room coming the cunt  Google can&#39;t even put that I&#39;m in UK  and can&#39;t handle me on here never mind all the new stuff.. Fuckers don&#39;t listen.. Power i got that and ban hammer lol . Fuck me I have done all this too help and not took a penny.. As I get music and a laugh   that&#39;s a fair deal..but money doesn&#39;t reach the right people   and they decide who gets too trend   its a stagnant as fuck.  Shake down   then  make some other world wide community that&#39;s fair   you on board
I dont like anything cutting in my screen and quite honestly i think its pretty GAY. I like the other one better.

Wow love your model she&#39;s so professional 10/10
Didn&#39;t like the video, felt like you just HAD to cover OnePlus 7T so you did. No efforts whatsoever.

I have the OnePlus 5T. I bought it 2 years ago, and I just discovered that there&#39;s an option to change the way the faceunlock works. Instead of opening directly, it scans you, and when you want, you slide up and it unlocks, like the Iphone X. Thought it was worth telling you about it.
Is it coming to the US?
You sell me.
I love my oneplus 7pro

Those speakers are good.
Is that the retail box
can you unbox oneplus tv?
The real question is that where is oneplus 8 till 69. I mean directly 7t (70) after 7.
That iPhone sounds like crap
MI mix alpha ???????!
I use Moto x4. The camera placement is same minus 1 sensor. ,😊
Hey, how about doing an unboxing on the OnePlus tv? It has some cool speakers!
Waiting for unboxing of Mi mix alpha...

It is just completely unnecessary to pay extra 600$ for software 😂😂<br>Android is great but iOS is not worth that much money coz be honest the difference is just down to preference<br><br>I&#39;m sure you guys will find another reason to defend it 🤑

OnePlus is the best phone, I&#39;ve had the OP3, OP3T, and now OP6. They had the best customer service, helping me whenever I dropped my phone in a lake 😅. Consistent quality for a price that can&#39;t be beat. I&#39;m serious, look up the specs. It&#39;s hardware is better than my laptop. Never switching!

Would be nice if Oneplus were a little more environmentally conscious.  Those review boxes and the booklet are extremely wasteful in the extreme....
overacting
It makes me sad when I have to throw away cool gadget boxes, but at least this one is large enough that you can reuse it to store something else.
Nice to see the ROG phone 2 is out . Not so sure those accessories are going to last but hell I’m getting one .

Its a long time i havent seen your videos you love apple you say its the best you ads the apple how much they give you i dont trust you any more

Very nice video with good information <br>👍 💞 💓 💝 💝 💘 💗 💚 💚 💛 💝💛👍
I hate to say it, but phones are getting boring, like they have hit a wall,8 cameras next time,silly!
I&#39;m not even a facial recognition fan, but that unlock from the profile was kinda crazy 😂
Ugliest from Oneplus so far. I just wish the camera setup was integrated into the back, making it an overall seamless glass back.  A bigger battery would be appreciated also wireless charging. Or just bring the audio jack back.
One plus is over hyped
and here I can&#39;t even buy a 10000 rs phone 😂😂😂
where are iphone reviews🤔
