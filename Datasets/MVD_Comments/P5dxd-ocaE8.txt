i seriously miss youtube rewind. it was just a great celebration of the platform and its creators. all they need to do is not make it woke and cringey and just get back to what used to make it popular.
fortnite
We all agree Youtube rewind 2018 is cringe-worthy. All The dislikes because too much liberation nonsense. Maybe nextime youtube rewind should respecting religious people because they do exists.
Even the guy who Will Smith wanted hates Rewind
The only thing i remember about 2017 is all my friends trying to mumble the lyrics of despacito üòÇ
Thank you Marques! Rewind videos have come to feel easier to understand for me now! Raza :)

I found you because of YouTube Rewind.

I finally know why youtube‚Äôs new update took away the dislike count on every video
Mark Ass Brownie
<b>Makass brownee</b>
Well, they definitely aren‚Äôt putting Will Smith in a rewind any time soon now!
&quot;Hey Will, if you&#39;re watching this, I would love to collab.&quot; hehe
Marques there‚Äôs a rewind in 2010 too. That was the first one. Not the 2011
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=510">8:30</a> &quot;Mark Ass Brownie&quot;
youtube and google, will, fundamentally never understand their consumers from their ivory tower.
You know capitalism is a cool thing... allows us to compete in a market and such... the problem is there comes a point where the stuff created is the product of numbers on a spreadsheet in an attempt to maximize profit. There&#39;s no real soul to it. It&#39;s just content created for the sake of content. I feel this is sadly the trend that content creators go through as they grow, they try to maximize audience and profit to the point where their big-budget videos feel scripted and robotic whereas their older content from waaaay back in the day has a charm to it because it was just them with their camera messing around with their friends.
Don&#39;t know what it is, but I&#39;m watching your videos backwards (and I&#39;m already here haha late 2018) and this is the best looking frame in a while. Every single one of the others are perfect, don&#39;t get me wrong, but this one... I don&#39;t know what it is, but is crispy as hell (more than usual) and also this depth of field... hope you see this, and remember what is is, to tell me and to also make more, just beautiful!
Its sad that youtube has stopped making them now :(
I just heard about YouTube rewind for the first time just now and came here because the dislike button is removed and people are talking about YouTube trying to pull the wool over some eyes, anyone know what the heck is going on?? I will petition to get the dislike button renewed
THIS WHY AM HERE BECAUSE THEY REMOVE THE DISLIKE FEATURE really messed up <br>they hide the truth of how we feel and think WE HATE GAY GAYS AND AND THERE WAYS SINNERS TO GOD <br>government are  devil worshipers seriously
No matter whether the rewind is the most hated thing on YouTube, you&#39;ll never be hated Marques!
20M dislikes and going, until they removed the dislike counter this year.
Another problem is that the videos that are popular at one time in a year, will not age well towards the end of the year. and people might get so sick of seeing it that they would hate it. like gangnam style was cool in the beginning then made everyone hate it when it was over played. and a lot of youtube videos cater to specific people, you cant have everyone like everything
how come today is the 1st time i ever heard of YouTube Rewind
Oh! And now the dislikes ratio is hidden from viewers... Funny, almost in time to &quot;get used to it&quot; prior to the release of the latest Rewind. Not fishy at all. Am I right?

So I&#39;ve been hearing Markass Brownie for about a week now and here are my thoughts
YouTube got so frustrated with the REWIND, that they didn&#39;t even do it this year...
This guy will review anything
Why the video length appears <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=671">11:11</a> while loading but becomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=670">11:10</a> after the load

Guess who is not featuring in the rewind next year because he said the truth...
Rewind might be the reason why YouTube started these double unskippable ads
Marquez: even if we add everyone want on youtube rewind its just hard to watch<br><br><br>Pewdie Gang: huh pathetic
I think instead of leaving him out of rewind, they should have listened to him

While I get where you&#39;re coming from, I think I disagree with the cutting down on the number of creators and trends. That would probably just make more people disappointed that they didn&#39;t see their favorite creator in the Rewind. Like you said, the Rewinds of 2013, 14 and 15 were loved even though they too had a lot going on. Things that people seem to dislike the most are prioritizing celebrities over Youtube creators, adding emotional segments which may feel disingenuous or politically motivated to some, ignoring some of the biggest events in the Youtube community, and of course leaving out some of the biggest and most loved creators. Obviously there&#39;s also the issue of Youtube trying to make advertisers happy so it&#39;s definitely not an easy fix.

Hi mark ass brownie
Sadak 2 üòÇüòÇüôè
Honestly I&#39;m pretty worried for the future of rewind because the negativity is insane from people and youtubers supporting it,I dont have any hate on anyone who doesn&#39;t like it, I&#39;m one of the many who doesn&#39;t like it but people are gonna start expecting much and godlike content from YouTube rewind because of the other two were horrible,people are gonna start getting the mentally that everyone is bad because people say it bad but yeh third times the charm,dont mess it up YouTube
Cant wait to dislike the next youtube rewind to keep the trend going
oh hey its mark ass brownie
bro he dont deserve the smoke he aint do anything wrong
The problem is <br>Pewwwwwwwdiiiieeeepieeeeeeeee
Pretty sure it not because of bad that has dislikes, has dislikes because it is meme tho dislike now
The problem with youtuberiwind 2018:<br>It has fortnite but not minecraft
Not this year(2020)
I have never watched YouTube rewind. <br><br>Why am I watching this.... To the end...
2013 was by far my favorite rewind.
This video has no ads I wonder why? <b>Cough Cough</b>
Mark has brownies
people who subscribe me will live 100 years
Man, how can he be so entertaining and engaging to listen to? <br>despite no background music, no crazy transitions or location change and still manages to catch our attention (like other &quot;content creators do bc they need that to kind of engage).<br><br> Great work MKBHD. üëçüèºüî•
@willsmith
I think they will just do a zoom meeting with some creators in YouTube rewind 2020 and that&#39;s it
YT the company is a lazy trash heap.
hobo johnson
They should give youtubers  the power &amp; let them make the rewind together,
The most disliked video started with your name being mentioned quite a few times..Lol
maybe yt stopped going to portal a and that&#39;s why this year&#39;s rewind was watchmojo style? and because of the negative connotation w/ yt rewind, they couldn&#39;t get another production company to work on it

he didn&#39;t say his name, he said &quot; markass&quot; his brother
unpopular opinion: rewind 2018 wasn&#39;t actually bad
this is now the most disliked video.<br><br><br><br>its now just by youtube.
I have a great idea , they should have differ type of rewinds for everyone, like <br>Rewind 2020 for Tech Enthusiasts<br>Or Rewind for Car Enthusiasts, etc that would be nice I guess
Tim Cook needs to be in youtube rewind.
I just went to jb&#39;baby just to dislike it

Do an unboxing of YT Rewind
I thought this was a tech channel ü§î
It was less what they cut out and not even what they included, what ticked people off was that they felt exactly what you said here: That this video was not made for them but for the advertisers. And that they have felt this for a long time now, that YouTube cares less and less about its viewers and only caters to their advertisers. While understandable, they are after all where the money comes from, it doesn&#39;t exactly sit well with us, the viewers that eventually make those advertisers pay YouTube money.<br><br>After the AdPocalypse and demonetization of a lot of content providers we liked and whatnot, this Rewind was the proverbial last straw. It wasn&#39;t so much that Rewind 18 was really bad, what caused the reaction it caused was mostly that it was showcasing that YouTube has essentially turned into cable TV: Bland, boring and trying to be as inoffensive as possible because they fear they&#39;d tick off advertisers if they as much as allow anyone to say a bad word.

MarkASS brownies
I made fun of you when i first heard marques brownlee, but after seeing your content, not anymore
wait . theres a 2010 rewind
I always wondered why all the channels I watch aren‚Äôt on there.
The first one is 2010
Let pewdiepie and russo brothers direct it
you know you have too much sharpness when there&#39;s moire on your skin.
Will Smith knows your name. Cant you appreciate that
even today i still like youtube rewind yes it was hectic but i think some people started hating on it and no one batted an eye and everyone just follow i thought it was much better that people moan about how it was no hate i love your videos
Markass brownie<br><br><br><br><br><br>-Will smith
What‚Äôs funny is that him and will actually did calab üòÇ
So this guy is Markass Brownies?
This is the real deal.
I think this year&#39;s YouTube rewind will be emotional.
The last YouTube rewind I&#39;ve seen was 2014. In my opinion, 2012 and 2013 YouTube rewind are the best ones.
Sad
The 24k üëé are the people that liked rewind
Still cute
If YouTube fixes itself YouTube rewind 2020 will be crazy
Great audio quality
My biggest issue was that it got political and preachy.
no it wasn‚Äôt
Captain Obvious
oh my this rewind is gona be weird
Markass brownie
You thought this was bad? wait till Rewind 2020
Who is waiting for 2020 YouTube rewind?
Where did they film will smith‚Äôs scene? Those mountains are gorgeous.

MARKASS BROWNLY<br>AND FARTNITE
You‚Äôre making this video sound better than it is.
Rewind 2020 better have pewdiepie in it, and in his segment, he should smash the cocomelon watermelon, with the cocomelon baby, inside.

Oh this is the mark ass brownie dude
Can‚Äôt wait for this years
It‚Äôs funny I don‚Äôt recognize half the people in any rewind videos.
No PewDiePie that was why we hated it
It‚Äôs become a tradition to dislike YouTube rewind
YouTube Rewind 2011 wasn&#39;t the first rewind. 2010 was.
My iPad is as old as a dinosaur (it&#39;s the original iPad mini) and I was watching a MrWhoesTheBoss video and it randomly decided to go back to the black screen with an apple logo on it
2011 YouTube Rewind = YouTube Rewind 2019

Yeaaaah  FoRtNiTe and  MaRkAsS bRoWnIe
I haven&#39;t watched a YouTube Rewind since the Gangnam Style one. Sad to heard about the decline
Why is that you r always there in rewind. Have u bribed youtube üòÇüòÇ
I‚Äôm sorry about the way will smith said your name
youtubers should come together and make their own yt rewinds every year.
literally the only cool things in youtube rewind are Marques and Will Smith. That&#39;s it
I do like Rewind 2018, and still love the &quot;mashup style&quot;, but this video really shows how 2018&#39;s Rewind didn&#39;t really know what it wanted to be - a normal Rewind, or one with a storyline.<br><br>They try to include more of a storyline with the dialogue, and the &quot;We&#39;re magically creating the Rewind while we&#39;re in it&quot; thing, but as Marques points when he talks about his scene, some of the storyline got edited out - the &quot;story telling&quot; style and the &quot;mash up&quot; style were competing with each other.  Another problem I&#39;ve heard is that the actual references didn&#39;t get much focus - probably because they had to keep going back to the campfire to introduce the next one; had they not done the storyline stuff about creating the Rewind, they could have given the references more focus, and had them all blend into each other or something.<br><br>It&#39;s a mess at times, but I still like it - the only thing I didn&#39;t like was the talking and the giving things away (as I probably said before), but it still had elements of being a Rewind to me, so it was like a weaker episode of the Rewind series.  2019&#39;s however, disappointed me big time.
Log on my youtube allways
So the first one was a watch mojo too... nice

I know I&#39;m over a year late and you probably won&#39;t ever see this but I actually discovered your channel through Youtube Rewind. You and a couple of other tech creators. I never used to watch tech vids and now I love them and this will have been a whole year that I&#39;ve been watching you now. Either way, thanks for being in Youtube rewind that year.
Its been 2 years from the Youtube Rewind 2018 and I&#39;m still laughing at FORTNIGHT and MARK ASS BROWNIE
Not even Mark Ass Brownie liked YouTube Rewind 2018
So your markass brownie, the guy who will Smith likes as much as fortnite

Imagine watching a video that lasts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=671">11:11</a> and your watching it at 11:11pm
Who else recognize that the thumbnail markass made was actually based on one of elon musk&#39;s most popular images ???? That face he made was spot on he must flick the beans to Elon or something.
If I control rewind I would want fortnite and markass brownlee<br><br><br><br><br>Markass brownlee???

We need the 2019 version
who want u mark fucking ass
The comments bellow so funny
He&#39;s right! The whole time my leg was shaking cause I was uncomfortable with how fast-paced it was. I feel like I was missing everything so I had to rewatch several times.
YouTube got so much hate in 2018 they just stopped trying in 2019
Here after the 2019 Rewind. They did the (sort of) right thing - a top of the best videos. BUT! They also did mash everything together with quick cuts and lots of songs. I think the whole Rewind thing is now so stained that it cannot be &#39;good&#39; again. The viewers will press the dislike simply because it is the Rewind thing.
IDK why this was in my recommended, its like for 2018 YTR and its 2019, when i first saw this i thought that he was going to talk about YTR 2019, its funny, idk i just had to say it
I have no problem with mark ass brown lips, but i hate him to my guts when i see him on yt rewind 2018. hes like represent some decent youtuber that gone bad.
Markass Brownlee: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=618">10:18</a><br>Youtube Rewind 2019: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=524">8:44</a>
Why is this recommended to me now...
I know you because of the YouTube rewind 2018! At least something good come from it right?
Congratulations in advance for 10M follower!!!
Little did he know youtube rewind 2019 would be a rewind back to youtube rewind 2011
the whole opening premise was wrong. The most dislike is Rewind 2018 by 7M over JB&#39;s measily 10M
I thought he said ‚Äúmark ass Browne‚Äù
I am  there after YouTube rewind 2019<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nothing has changhed
now 2019 rewind just went back to a top 10 list
They should‚Äôve included the KSi was Logan Paul fight in my opinion

I want FOrtnite and marques brownlee
oh look its Markass brownie
Watching that markass brownlee again
ive never seen david dobrik in the yt rewind yt is being rude dont you agree markass brownlee
Unpopular opinion: I feel bad for the producers and creators of rewind last year, and as this one aproaches I hope the community can be a bit more forgiving, effort still goes into this and it may not be what we want, but there are a few people who actually decided what happens.
M    A    R   K    A    S    S    S
Hmmm....YouTube.....well really Google....no wait....its really &quot;Alphabet Inc&quot;. Guess corporate has finally made their way into EVERY aspect of Content Creation.....I guess I&#39;ll start going through my subscriptions and UN-subscribe from the ones who have been &quot;tamed&quot; by guys in suits!
I thought they signed a contract to not speak about it oof<br>(And the rewind was indeed a failure)
You are the problem
I am just waiting for the new one....
Almost 12 months have passed.. It&#39;s <b>almost</b> Rewind Time again, lads!
finally I found the original Mark Ass Brownie guy!
If MrBeast not included in this year rewind people be raiding youtube rather than area 51
Markass Brownie
I 100% agree
the funny thing is that rewind 2019 is worse then rewind 2018
Markass brownie
Hey its the MARKASS BROWNLEE GUY!!<br>EDIT: Now that you think about it, it is kind of true. Well, now I feel bad that markass might not be in the rewind 2019 because he splashed the truth out and I will miss pewds spelling out &#39;markass&#39; while reacting to 2019 rewind.
also, its the fact that youtube is being terrible to other youtubers lolol. Like to Markiplier, (i came here cuz of him) Almost all his live-stream viewers lost their youtube AND google accounts because youtube banned them for no apparent reason. (sure, maybe 6 comments in the span of 2 hours) and Youtube says they are unable to fix it when they&#39;re just lazy and can&#39;t be bothered. OH, and a major thing is the fact that PewDiePie wasn&#39;t on rewind when he was such a big thing in 2018 xD
Pewdiepie vs Tseries, arguably the biggest event to ever happen on YouTube, was just swept under the rug, and that‚Äôs what annoyed the shit out of me
so      the       shootings     begin      again
Rewind 2017 is the best from my perspective
I would want... fortni-
well there are no pewdiepie and T-series and pubg
Lets fuck portal-A and let creators make rewind 2019
Maria‚Äôs brownlee
I would love to meet MarkAss Brownie.
Weezer - Pork And Beans was the first Youtube Rewind.
Marques Brownlee<br><br>-the guy Will Smith wanted in Youtube Rewind 2018
For the 2021 rewindn, for the 10 year anniversary.<br>Instead of Rebacca Black doing the 10 most viewed videos of the year it should pewdiepie doing the ten most viewed videos by CREATORS from 2011-2021 in meme review or lwiay style.
markASS BROWNIE
It needs to be like a 4 part or 2 part vids
We need more memes and less U.S. political agendas. Who watches rewind for political reasons? And Will Smith doesn&#39;t care about YouTube. Give us PewDiePie or Elon Musk
Yeah but, where the fortnite?
The problem was that there was no pewdiepie,Mr.Beast,T-series, and a few other people
Here when it was 6.9 million views
to me the major thing was how forced the newer rewinds come across, its hard to watch, like a kids friendly corporate lifeless commercial, covering up its fakeness with a mind boggling amount of cuts, colors and names. its like most of the youtubers are getting rid of their own unique style and directed to be someone they simply arent.<br>acting is tough as fuck, so with youtubers who are for the most part used to being themselves, they should just be themselves and allow them to take part in the scripting process.
hello, this is markass Brownie?
I cant wait for the Pewdiepie YT Rewind 2019
Next one is release in a month.<br><br><del>hope it isn‚Äôt shit</del><br>it will be shit
Marques Brownlee just said the truth
stop telling me things i already know!!!
I feel as though the will smith thing would have been so much cooler this year given will smith was genie this year
2016 was the best
The problem with YouTube Rewind:<br>The dislikes is too low.
So your that Markass Brownie guy<br><br><br>Ight imma head out
2019 i ma head in this time
The problem with youtube rewind<br><br>Youtube rewind 2018
How did this get any dislikes, must of been all of YouTube‚Äôs bots
Mark ass brownlee
MARKASS BROWNIE!
They should not of put fortnight in the rewind
What were your favorite moments or moments that you think should have been left out of last year? What do you think should be included in THIS year...?
Ah Shitt!! rewind is coming again
When will smith said you‚Äôre name i I thought he said Markass brownie
If I could control rewind I would want...
The first time I ever heard about you was on YT rewind 2018 and, gotta admit, I started avoiding your videos when they showed up on my recommendations (I watch A LOT of tech videos). But then I had your &quot;BTS with Lew&quot; video in front of me and couldn&#39;t help myself (gotta love Lew). Dude, I totally regretted avoiding your channel. Instant subscription. I&#39;ve seen dozens of your videos ever since. You&#39;re one of the best tech youtubers over here.
Markass Brownlee
I found you because of Youtube Rewind and have started watching all of your videos + JerryRigEverything. Love you guys, but kinda disappointed it came from YT rewind lol.
We‚Äôve come to the conclusion : Youtube Rewind sucks.
Everything

Who wants pewdepie and Mr Beast in rewind 2020<br>üëá
Markass Brownie, man please
(I&#39;m a little late to this but) You definitely made some good points. However, 2018&#39;s youtube rewind (the worst one) also has a lot to do with representing the best of the worst and the worst of the best. Fortnite, kpop, all of the represented things weren&#39;t respectively paired with its fanbase/audience, making it seem forced and not original in the slightest. They mention in the rewind that it&#39;s time for them to represent what THEY like and how they want to see it played out, but instead acted as pawns to the biggest influences in the year and weren&#39;t able to showcase what they personally were able to accomplish and influence themselves. I&#39;m not saying the creators don&#39;t appreciate fortnite, kpop, etc. but instead youtube should have put in their respective fanbases. To fortnite, a community of gamers dancing, to kpop, Korean&#39;s dancing with a huge audience in the background (in a sense it is appreciating by placing the creators in kpop but like again, they aren&#39;t the ones who represent kpop and its influence in anyway at all.) The animators, (a little before the middle of the video) were represented properly, with all of them collaborating to a song in their own styles. The worst however starts at the middle of the video. It&#39;s one thing to talk about the greats and accomplishments of the year, but it&#39;s another when you try to push your political agenda into something meant to be creative and awesome. Most of what they were saying came off as indirectly shaming people who didn&#39;t side with them when they mentioned, stuff like mental illness, women empowerment, Asian representation, working single moms, and etc. It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t people who respect and acknowledge it, but  everyone has their own EQUALLY meaningful opinions about views on society especially when it comes to the political spectrum of things. It was unnecessary and really destroyed the vibe of the video. But after that segment toward the last few minutes, what youtube rewind SHOULD have been from the start actually showcases all the great things that made the year fun, (of course with the exception of creators taking the spot of highlights that didn&#39;t represent them at all.)<br><br><br>I hope they can fix their wrongs and give 2019 a good Youtube rewind. A one where creators and the top trending things of this year are met with their respective fanbase/audience. Also, I do hope to see Pewdiepie in there as well. After getting married and hitting the 100 million subcount as an individual creator, there is no possible way not to congratulate it.
I want fork knife and markass brownie
The problem is that there is no pewd (for short)
Wonder how 2019 rewind will be?
Yt before 2016 : fun entertaining and awesome <br><br>Yt post 2016 : authoritarian, divided and not fun

Hey did you guys see that MarKaz brownie comment?
Why the hell Youtube would take TWITCH BIGGEST FORNITE STAR NINJA in ther annual rewind he is not even a youtuber he use the platform to promote his stream videos on TWITCH
It&#39;s funny he called will Smith not that big of a YouTuber and now he just interviewed himüòÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=391">6:31</a> It annoys me so much that that was filmed a Harrow, literally the library at my school.
Wow just watching this for kicks, went on your page and you actually did collab with Will Smith lol
Happy 6.9 million views
markASSSSSSS BROOOOOWNLEEEEEEEEWWW
Heh üòè this video is currently at 6.9 million views <br><br><br><br>Like if you are one of these 6.9 million viewers.
I‚Äôm late, let me make a joke<br><br><br><br><br><br>Markass Brownie
Aah that&#39;s hot.
They better include Minecraft in 19&#39;s rewind
Am I the only one who noticed that the video is exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5dxd-ocaE8&amp;t=671">11:11</a> long
Coming back a bit later, I still feel as though I disagree slightly. A point you made was that each rewind has had the bad habit of attempting to fit too much in such little time. Your suggested solution was to simply remove or certain events or content. However I firmly believe that retaining the events important to each portion of YouTube supported by different communities is almost quintessential. YouTube in 2012 was much smaller and contained a more isolated community with similar interests. However, as the platform genuinely evolved, it became a multitude of communities as opposed to the idea that YouTube was simply one community. My suggested solution is produce the video in a manner where each scene has it&#39;s own meaning and a interleaved relation to each community. In other words, allow the video to be longer. I&#39;m sure I would even prefer that to the short montage style.
Markass brownie?
Brownie ?
Stop the Mark ass brownie<br>Give the boy respect+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Sorry, no, it never TURNED INTO an ad for YouTube - that is what it always was.  Perhaps the content is a little different now, but really - let&#39;s not put on those flowery glasses.
Glad I&#39;m not the only one who noticed dat black ass<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>.... I&#39;m talking about Rebecca Black of course...<br>Gee, who were you thinking about, you racist? ‡≤†œâ‡≤†

Hello everyone it&#39;s MarkAss Brownlee
The whole thing was a circle jerk for asia.
Honestly YouTube rewind is dumb... it isn&#39;t like its motivating people to be with the community... its like just watching a music video mashup...
I meet you by the rewind, and (true) I searched &quot;Markass&quot;, now I love your content, saludos de M√©xico.
I still watch this and laugh how people say you cant please everyone.........simple add pewdiepie and problem is solved.
Sorry for the clich√© comment<br>Hey mom?<br>Yeah?<br>What‚Äôs for dessert?<br>I baked a batch of Mark ass brownies if you want.<br>Ok but can I have some fortnite with it?<br>Ok son
PewDiePie didn‚Äôt deserve to be in rewind since he‚Äôs an arrogant racist prick. But I do agree with you that YTR has changed from the fun simple video it used to be.

Can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t know who Marques Brownlee was but I&#39;ve been watching all of his (your) content the whole past year without even knowing it.
I just noticed, I heard your name Marques Brownlee somewhere in YouTube rewind 2018 and I just noticed that you were in it.<br><br>I subbed for the tech reasons though, that&#39;s why I&#39;m still subbed to you.<br><br>Didn&#39;t figure this out now until like almost a year later XD
youtube rewind is ironically what got me into mkbhd

Youtube: you&#39;ve already watched this but I&#39;ll recommend it again.<br><br>Me: watches it.
Why am I the only one that likes 2018 rewind
I&#39;m watching this in September and I&#39;m just waiting for the next YT rewind and dang this year&#39;s rewind better be good
What can YT do to make it better next year?....well, simple.. bring back Pewdiepie.
A lot of words to say basically nothing. Boring. Like your other content.

Marques, yo&#39;re great at explaining what went wrong with youtubes monstrosity of a Rewind. When I first watched YR 2018 I had a hard time understanding what Will Smith was sayin&#39;. (To be fair, I had never heard your name before because I watch Linus Tec Tips instead when it comes Tec-Vids..)<br>But I was 18 sec in and wonder: What the F is an &quot;Mark Ass Brownie&quot;?!?!<br><br>Will: Articulate!!! Avoid words like ASS and BROWNIE
Ok,but who&#39;s Marques Brownlee?
id pay a rewind if every creator would make an ironic video by dressing up as pewdiepie and shouting pewdiepie for 10 minutes and 1 second. also put irony kpop idk
If pewdiepie getting married,beating the ender dragon, and getting to 100M and it‚Äôs not rewind there will be problems.
It&#39;s crazy I didn&#39;t know MKBHD until watching rewind and now he&#39;s one of my Fav tech youtubers üòÇüòÇ

if pepsi man isnt in youtube rewind 2019 then ima go drink axe bodywash
The sad thing for youtube rewind 2019 is that they will use minecraft in some nasty way, and also they will probably say something about t-series passing pewdiepie
For him he doesnt mind being cut out itself shows how humble marques is.
I like how he‚Äôs not defending youtube at all and that‚Äôs good <br><br><br><br>Btw <br>M A R K A S S   B R O W N I E E
Youtube, the platform not the content creators of youtube, cannot make people happy anymore. The golden era of youtube has passed, and now they are filled with this greed that they can&#39;t contain.
I bet he won‚Äôt be asked to be in 2019

It&#39;s just sad on how I been on YouTube for 3 years with no fame... Plus, my nephew deleted almost all my videos so don&#39;t use that lame excuse. So if you want to support me, plz subscribe, just do it, please... Also YouTube treats me like shit and keeps recommending random drama I didn&#39;t watch nor want to watch. So YouTube, fuck you, and your company and maybe add me in your rewind, maybe I&#39;ll make it better üò°üñï fuck YouTube. I&#39;ll stop saying this if you stop treating me like shit!

So basically you are telling us how you suffered in the making of youtube rewind 2018?
Man those videos are cringe as fuck. Rewind IMO should be kind of showing who blew up on youtube for the year with what video, I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t show any of the big guys but I think it&#39;s really cool seeing people who have been at it for years and now finally are seeing some progress with their channels, why not embrace that and show them in a rewind as well.
Markass Brownshit
If I could control rewind this year I would want, Fortnite and Markass Brownlee
Why am i watching it in the middle of 2019?
OMG they made Mark ass brownie from the yt-rewind into a real person.<br>Lmao
I gave it a thumbs up because he said the line :)
Mmmm i really want some mArKaSs BrOwNiE
now all we need need is fortnite
well saidüëê
XXXTENTACION&#39;s death was kinda big, caused a lot of people to become depressed and/or suicidal. Yet youtube said fuck it and didnt include that
All the comments about <b>&quot;Markass Browniee&quot;</b> made me laugh so hard
I personally thought 2016 and even kinda sorta 2017 were pretty good. 2018, total sellout. Catering to the big companies and liberal PC fucktards. Don&#39;t like what I just said? You probably are one. They said we control rewind. They lied. They made it the exact you opposite. Sellouts.
leave some stuff out? how about actually LISTENING to what the people want to see n not advertising for money
If YouTube wants to improve Rewind,<br>They should hire Pewdiepie
All rewind is now, YouTube circle jerk with its Left hand.
PREACH
It‚Äôs called rewind because  that‚Äôs what happened to the quality
Fuck ass brownie
Mark Ass Brownie
Discovered Mark-ass via Will Smith. Very good video to explain all this.
Lol he cant even spell his own name, its clearly Markass Brownee
<b>IS THIS WHAT U WANTED?</b>

The biggest problem for u is that Will Smith called you mark-ass brownlee

PewDiePie !! You can‚Äôt make rewind without adding the God of YouTube. He may not be the most subscribed anymore but he is the most subscribed REAL YouTuber/content creator.

you should watch the &quot;google year in Review&quot; or &quot;Yahoo year in ReView&quot; both of them are WAY better then YouTube Rewind
You don‚Äôt Deserve to be in the Worst Rewind
I cant help it bro your barber needs to be fired
MARKASS BROWNIE: this year&#39;s rewind&#39;s like YouTube calling advertisers &quot;hey,these are people who are good for paying to show ads<br>Me:he is in the video

My bad, it&#39;s not 26M dislikes yet, but 16M atm.
The content is from Twitter, twitch, news, Netflix, kpop, BUT NOT ENOUGH YT!
I hate YouTube ads!! Keep them out of the rewind!
Um, Rewind 2018 is at 26M dislikes now.

Thanks so much for explaining actually! I was completely lost when I watched that rewind, I didn&#39;t understand what the hell the flying bus was all about (I heard that Fortnite was a game but obviously never played it) and it just was totally lost on me. And you&#39;re right, everything was happening so fast that it never ended up making much sense.
