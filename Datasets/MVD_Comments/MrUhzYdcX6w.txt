Are these worth it now in 2022? 😄
Do anyone experience side by side clicking sound when move case lid right left?
Still good..
Just got these from a tweaker for 48$ and a soda 😂
Me as a 14 yr old watching this with my airpods &quot; ah yes &quot;
How is this not the &quot;Most replayed&quot; part of the vid? Min <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=371">6:11</a>
Gen 2 out Now!
lol
Im watching this on my new airpod pros. I love them so much
Sir I am your big fan
I am from Assam India
Wtf is with the ads man. Ur page is kinda getting annoying bcoz of these ads
It is pair with Android?
Where’s the Apple event (not commercial) for the 2019’s ?
That intro reminds me of something ph
I&#39;m finally getting mine in a few days. Can&#39;t wait. &lt;3
I think the next iteration will be the one to get
Yaaaaaa, fornite and markaass braunlee
Watching this with my AirPods Pro on. No kidney tho. But good audio.
hohoho the AirPower prototype
Yup I am getting one today
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=110">1:50</a> i have that ladder in the background
Change the intro sound plzzzzzzz
Cod was a small one ☝️ I had the wrong 😑 but the only one ☝️ I got in my room is a bit dry but it is so good and I think eryyui
I was going to buy Airpods Pro but then found some good clones (Navapods). Everything is literally the same as on the original airpods but they cost only 60$ I think. Crazy. Sure, sound isn&#39;t exactly the same as on my friend&#39;s original airpods pro but he paid so much more lol. I&#39;d say the sound quality is about 80% compared to retails. Even the active noise cancelling works lmao.
Why they call it pro<br>I DON’T KNOW 🤷‍♂️
I have them
these actually sound amazing. great highs and lows beautiful bass
andrew trying to take a pic of mac 😂
but this airPod is the bestApple AirPods Pro
I have both and I say bull shit beats are better
I got mine last night and it was so awesome partner with my iphone 13 mini blue🌷
Kinda pricey!!!!! As they say you get what you paid for &quot;quality&quot;. Not a Fakey.
Me listening to this on airpods pro
Airpods only playing in one ear on Macbook Pro (unless I keep Sound Preferences window open)<br><br>So, here&#39;s a puzzler. Over the last day, my normally-fine Airpods will only play through the left ear when connected to my Macbook Pro, but play fine through both ears on my iPhone. However, when I open the Sound Preferences window on my Macbook, the right ear Airpod connects. When I close that window, the right ear Airpod immediately stops. Is there a fix for this, or I am now taking this extra step going forward?
You are handsome
I have got AirPods pro as a gift and the charging usb seems not working <br>1. I have tried with power bank which has usb c port but no sign of charging <br>2. I have thought to charge with my iPhone adapter so ordered usb c to usb male converter but when i start charging AirPods nothing sign of charging showing when i connect lighting to iphone and another side usb c to converter then adapter but wire start warming up .<br>Now i am confuse how to charge if I don&#39;t have wireless charger, any usb c port device, mac or something?
I just copped the pros. Pretty nice
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men 💕👍
I mean this is pretty awesome technology
Cool 👍👍
i literally have the complete opposite problem 🥲🥲🥲🥲 yall they don’t stay in 💔 they constantly fallout bc i have small ears 🤦🏽‍♀️ lowkey should’ve got the 3’s 🥲
The thing is the pros in 2021 have even more settings then the ones shown in this video
I’m not impressed with these air pods, Samsung Galaxy buds live sound way better.
What a bad design I think, I mean samsung and pixel buds look better. It looks like someone has pulled off wire from normal wired earphones.
Nothings up, thanks.
Pods
Could you please make a video of the new Sony WF1000XM4? (8hr battery life, much more compact case and foam tip fit)<br>If possible please make a comparison between Airpods 3 vs Airpods Pro? (6hrs battery life being the most difficult part)<br>Since the black Friday and Holiday seasons are coming, so many people are really struggling to make a purchase. Thanks in advance.
Honestly I think the regular AirPods are prettier
Is that really Linus in the background?
Good for gym right?
damm i just bought the airpods pro and i watch this video the exact same date as this video was realesed 2 years ago
It’s crazy how much views this guy gets for doing reviews <br>Maybe I should start YouTube and do the same thing :)
Man at first I was so confused why they kept falling out my ear but when I tried new tips they didn’t fall out but the phone said the tips that fell out my ears were good for my ears
Who’s watching this while wearing AirPods pro
I got my airpods for free
Its a peashooter.
Who else is watching this with the AirPod pros?
Thank you! 🙏
Amazing one 👌🏻
Yo love the noice cancellation
They should now be called airpods mini
Best love them
I can’t wait to get mine
Please can anybody give me the list of (how to get/where to get these tracks) 358 unique audio tracks which provided by apple for testing. Which always provided by apple  IN the end of any music product they provide. Please reply it will be really helpful and i will really really gr8fl to him if someone give me that list. Pls Its a request to you bros...sisssss....
Ah, exactly the phrase I want to hear before purchasing a $250 audio device. &quot;They sound fine.&quot;
Good product, expensive, but the sound quality is painfully average
Is it still worth it a year later.?
is it just me or when i wear my Airpod pro it feel like it&#39;s going to come off easily.???
Hello.Setings 4 airpods pro,are avalible on ipad pro?tanx
Recommanding after an year as I am more into nothing ear(1) reviews
The gen 1 was a new standard in listening to Internet.  But man that have used their game truly .. its beautiful 😍 thanks for reading ✌
lowkey gonna grab airpods pro in 2021 tho
Reply to this comment if you have the same problem, the AirPods Pro case top cover is wiggling
I like the way you get to business with out waste of time
It needs serious equalizers… i want to boost 8k to 12k and 40 to 80 hertz frequencies and attenuate 3k to 5k frequencies…
Do they sound like crap… yes nearly crap
Can I track where it is if it&#39;s lost
These are $449 NZ$ here. Just a bloody Apple rip off
You only did a half unboxing!!! Like come on!
Pingu, nooot nooot 😂
Great review man!
I like how I found it on Amazon for like 187 but people are still saying their broke
Awesome
Fastest unboxing no time waste
Wonder if I can use other tips since I have a hard time with fit.
DO NOT PURCHASE ! severe battery corrosion issue with this product,  its trash and apple doesn&#39;t support its consumers
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=183">3:03</a> the person in the background his dog is going to be the new doge meme
Thanx for your review
If the ear pieces stops working when the case dies I don’t see the point of getting these
Audio quality from earpods much more better than airpods pro wasted money
I have the AirPods Pro , but I remember how my headphones with lightning saved my phone many times 🥺😭😭
My mom ordered a single box of Tylenol from target using that “drive up” thing. The people walked the bag out to her car and put it in, nothing fishy, a small box in a plastic bag. When she got home she realized it was a box of AirPods Pro….. she returned them.
Well i unboxed my airpods pro With the iphone 12 pro max...😑
I wish AirPods Pro had volume control cause you can just put music on then when you want the volume up then you can’t but I still love them I have them too!
I love this guy
why didn&#39;t you try to shake the pro buds out of your ears like you did the older pair?
Apple was simpler before 1st April 1976 when it was just a fruit
Less toothbrushy Lol 😂
your intro almost gets my parents worried
Kindly Dm millson _hack on Instagram he help me got my airpod for free which he ship in no delay dm him
Please do a video on galaxy buds live

Who else is watching this video in Airpods pro? 😅
If you try to find AirPods Pro master copy you can get exact same features
Just picked these up today and so far I am impressed for the price it better be good When I was really looking for is this something that don’t fall out of my ear
I’m listening on them 😂
Watching while listening on OG earpods. Sounds good

Nobody:<br>Me: watches a review of AirPod pros with AirPod pros

Me hoping one day will these will come down in price. Maybe I’ll be able to get them in 2035…

Great video. Saving up for them right now 😄
<b>cries</b>
I really liked mine at first but I have using mine a lot and tried the ear tip fit test but they have been falling out
My ears started getting irritated after using airpod pro, prolly because of to much noise canceling ?
Yo peeps!  <br>Stop right now <br>Since l&#39;m getting a iPhone 12 pro max<br>Should l get the air pods<br>Or air pod pros<br>Also now l can get away with listen to music in class because l have long hair and its always covering me ears.  <br>And apparently according to google you can connect your iPhone to your watch then your watch to your airpods apparently and school said <br>You can&#39;t bring your phone to school but they never said you can can&#39;t bring air pods and a watch
I only just bought some on Amazon for £142/$200. And they are 👌. Had Powerbeats Pro before this video when they dropped. They are much more useful for exercising.
Airpod pros user be like: Ayo AirPod pro rate my fit G<br>AirPod pro: sheeeeee mans drippin 10/10 fit!<br><br>Let’s goo ha..you know it baby n-
Asshole in unboxing video you have to show the content. Dickhead
Watching these on my AirPods Pro<br><br>Just Trying to justify the spend AHA

!!!STOP!!!! here is a chance to win airpods pro
I wanna know what the guy in the back was talking otp about
If there is anyone out there who has worn the AirPods 2 and if it fit well in the ear, how do the AirPods Pro feel in the ear if you’ve tried them?
I LOVE THEM CAUSE I CANT HERE MY SISTERS VOICE
Oooop
It&#39;s also equal to sony  apple samsung
Pls unbox lg tone free buds
can you listen to music if you leave without your phone but you take with you the apple watch and the airpods pro ??
Got a pair last week for €70, brand new, still sealed. Got lucky on eBay.
Active noise cancelation is good...but the sound quality is just average...definitely overpriced...if any of you have budget earphones like 10 dollars one, just be happy cuz airpods doesnt sound any different....
fuck your review
“Ear Tip Fit”. There’s a sucker born every day. Other reviewers: “Sometimes it works and sometimes not.” Exactly. Because it’s a gimmick. Good Lord.
Do you need to charge the case?
You said unboxing.  That means you should of told people what to do, how to connect, ect.  There is no reason for me to put them in my ears if they aren’t charged, etc.  My instructions don’t tell me how to do anything.
remember Jesus and God loves you and remember Jesus die on a cross for our sins and rose again repent get saved he is coming soon God bless you 🙏
God knows your heart and is not so concerned with your words as he is with the attitude of your heart. “For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.” Romans 2:13❤️ God bless you all, God loves you and so do I!!!

Omg!!! I am impressed by the high quality of the video. What kind of camera u use?
You open things like you open Apple products everyday, oh right, you do
rubber tip is the way of earbud
Wearing them while watching the video
Does the active noise cancellation of Airpods Pro COMPLETELY BLOCK all the background noise? Or it depends on how loud the noise are? Like for example I am outside and there are birds chirping around? Will I still be able to hear em with just Active noise cancellation on without any music? Thanks to whoever would respond.
Am I the only that tried all three ear tip sizes that it comes with and all of em were good seal when I took the ear tip fit test? Kinda weird and confusing coz now I don’t really know what size of ear tip to use? Lmao
I can&#39;t help thinking the latest complete-wireless model from Bose has been influenced a lot from this one. they look just like fava beans.
Excellent...

By far the BEST investment I&#39;ve done on headphones. I can finally relax, focus on reading and meditation and &quot;escape&quot; from the noisy environment haha<br>AirPods Pro can calm your nerves, I totally recommend it!
It&#39;s only support for iPhone?
Nothing is up. Why do you all ask?
Can ipod pro connected to PC Win10?
My brother looked at me when I played this video kinda sus
Thanks!!! My first Air Pods !!! I love them !!!♥️

I just got these for Christmas yesterday I mean my first gens I just didn’t like them and I dint even ask but yeah

I have got the first AirPods (actually I don’t know if they are gen 2 I have no idea how to look it up) and I tried the pros from a friend and i don’t think They are Even a Little bit better. The noise canceling is nice but the sound is like the same.
I just got em&#39;
the noise cancelling is so nice when you sit next to an air vent or have a noisy computer. would buy again..
Just copped these
Which airpods should i get? Should i get the pro?
Pano sakin
I like turtles
Thanks for reviewing 👍👍👍
Now kind of obsolete with the existence of Apple&#39;s new baby.

I&#39;m so happy to have deal with Robin_custompro on telegram I just received my order at affordable price
When you pay $250 US for earbuds,<br>How is the sound quality?<br>It’s fine.
OMG that is so expensive I wish I had more money
Getting these because u told me everything about them
“Fine” “better” “ok” Ok those are definitely impressions.
Just regard me as homeless as I’m using the wired headphones aye?

Hfufufuy
I bought them about 2 months ago here in U.K. as didn’t have the money when they first came out. I have used them on a plane to corfu and they work amazingly well on noise cancelation . <br>I have the issue of them falling out my ears but these definitely stay in. <br>With sound quality I think they are amazing. I listen to most hard heavy bass dance music. Aka Gabber and hardcore. They play it great without distortion.<br>Only issue I have now is Apple have decided to bring in hearing protection .
Just got my Airpods Pro for my home office (phone calls, Zoom, Teams meetings). For THIS they are little more then ok. BUT if you love to hear music or watch movies on your Mac/iPad they are NO Good .. Periode. I miss one Pair of Wireless InEar Pods:  BOSE SoundSport Free wireless. In my opinion they are the BEST for Powerful music and movie sound experience 10/10. Ok they look little funny in the ears, BUT the Bass and overall Sound Experience is worth it !  Way better then the Sonys, Beats, etc. - But Thanks for your great reviews! 💯
I absolutely love the intro music! It’s fire 🔥
My super clones are from iplaypodscom and they are awesome i love them so much. They have new version that is awesome.
I have the Powerbeats pro, the sound is really good but it’s annoying if you have glasses on and the case is huge! I’m thinking about getting these but I don’t know
i HAVE TO GET THESE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE $195 instead of $250 lol I NEED DEM
I don&#39;t understand, the price is 249 but he says 250? Can someone explain why?
THIS IS CRAZY:<br><br>Just search the APPLE SUPPORT COMMUNITIES for:<br><br>&quot;Airpods Pro keep falling out of my ears!&quot;<br><br>You get postings like this:<br><br>Honestly Apple, half the world are complaining about <br>these airpods pro falling out of our ears... why dont <br>you make the bud slightly longer . Ive even used a cheap <br>pair of headphones which go behind my ear to wear while <br>jogging so that the airpods are pushed into my ear ... <br>just 2mm longer with memory foam and they wont fall out ... <br>none of my other earphones fall out ... You have also changed <br>the system so that nobody elses earplugs fit onto the new apple <br>system so we cant solve the problem !!!..<br><br>Apple ignores thousands of postings like this, except if you<br>mention Class Action Lawsuit. Then the delete your posting.<br><br>This has been going since they came out. Even if you have AppleCare, <br>they will do nothing because they &quot;are not broken&quot;. <br><br>Even wrote to Tim Cook. He however, unlike Steve Jobs, Pays no attention<br>to customers.<br><br>Wish I would still have the old ones.
I’m listening to this on my AirPods Pro <br>Ohh thanks guys for 100 likes
I got AirPods pro as a gift. Is it Apple ?
Guys what do you think about iplaypods,com? I got pods from them and i think they are great.

I think he climb on the ladder and do drop testing
I just bought the Airpods Pro for $200.  Now I&#39;m waiting for 12  Pro Max.  I&#39;ve been with Android (Samsung) for the last 10 years.  Can someone or anyone tell me if I&#39;ll like Apple product?
I think I&#39;ll wait for the airpods 3 bro.
Great vid really informative I am tryin to decide on the best quality noise cancellation wireless edfnes x
I’m not really a big fan of in ear headphones especially ones with the soft tip because they always push out of my ear. Do the pros soft tip do that??
1 question man when u put it on the airpods in ur ear does it fall of? Cuz I&#39;m getting it for Christmas XR and Airpods pro but the thing is it might fall of?
I died when he said Pingu 😂❤️
And I’m here with Beats Solo Pro
I’m getting mine tmrw! I’ll update on them when I use them!<br><br><br>Edit: I used them for about 2 days and I love them! The sound quality, the noice cancellation and transparency mode is working well!

Those suck
There is a huge thread in the Apple Discussions about these new tips causing people itchy and infected ears, yet Apple is not even bothering to reply. The tips they use are not the same silicone ones as other brands and are causing people some serious issues, so if you have sensitive ears, think twice before investing in these overpriced health hazards.

How will all these features work against Android?
Wow that&#39;s just AirCrap Pro for 249$ .

If you have Airpods without the “Pro”, you are officially broke now.

I didnt even start this video and already gave it a thumbs up.
You can buy a Spigen rubber thing for regular AirPods if they fall out of your ear and that&#39;s the only reason you&#39;re considering Pro. Costs $8.
A little bit late but I now have the airpods pro for 130 dollars <br>Message me on IG @wrldsamuel
The battery in the earbuds cannot be replaced, therefore after a year or so you need to shell out another $234 bucks.  Anyone?
Is there an issue with the case hinge? There is some sideways play to the lid accompanied by cracking noise.

Your personal take on these products make everything worth it. &quot;Why are they called Pro? IDK.&quot; lol. Exactly what I think with every product and branding.
the only way i could afford this is with the education sale/pricing 😂

For guys: you’re wearing airpods; and have to take a leak; use this procedure. Push them firmly in your ears. Do your business. Immediately Close the seat lid. Flush. Exit the bathroom with caution. There have been a handful of cases of them dropping into the throne. Try to avoid this.
the airpods pro do be lookin like bellsprout from Pokemon
It&#39;s better to say how to waste money  on a headphone .

I highly recommended los_hacker11 on Instagram he help get my new airpods pro from Amazon
DM los_hacker11 @Instagram to get yours
I don’t think I’ll get them. My regular AirPods do the job...
Is the volume louder than the original air pods?
clean vines
Who&#39;s watching them while wearing the pros?
Can the AirPods pro work with iPhone 11
I’m selling some Brand new AirPods Pro respond if you are interested
the only reviews i trust
There’s is a course at Harvard I can do with that amount of money
I love how they look 🤷‍♂️
Ppl be out here buying $1200 and $2000 computers but whining about $250 😂
the apple earphones or the airpod was/is the best ergonomically designed earphone made. People can wear it for hours as well as while sleeping without causing any irritation or pain. But the new design seems that people would not be able to use it while lying on the bed or sleeping as the excessive protruding thing will start causing pain. Had Steve Jobs been alive, he would have got the new features delivered with the original ergonomical design itself.
Are you using the AirPods Microphone? or your own
New name for AirPods poor pods

Me watching this when I’m getting them on Sunday..... and it’s thrusday!
ok but i NEED matt black
What an awesome video on AirPods Pro. I have recently started ASMR unboxing channel have a look. And make sure to subscribe.
Ordered these a few hours before the new update was announced for them... so I’m still apart of the elite
I just purchased these yesterday and wow!! I’m mind blown. The noise cancellation activates with just a single tap. I kept turning noise cancellation on and off. The sound is crisp and clean it’s a go. 👍🏾
U man is rich, give me some of your money  LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=276">4:36</a> anybody saw that?

Great review.. Thanks 👍
This guy is literally the most entertaining and funniest product reviewer there is 😂😂
Can these be used literally as a hearing aid? With the new requirements to wear a mask at work plus my everyday glasses my over the ear hearing aid just doesn&#39;t work.
they look like pea shooter from plants vs zombies

NAH MY MAIL MAN THREW MY PACKAGE NECT TO MY FRONT DOOR AND DENTED THE BOX

I like the AirPower nod
Just pick up a pair and I am happy with them... thanks for your review...
He ruined the ASMR of unboxing products
How do you go to the ear top for test
This product is scam product, I’ve replaced 2 yet now.. same issue airpods 2 !! Battery bleed out fast after short time of using it’s not sustainable at all,, I WOULDN’T RECOMMEND FOR ANYBODY!!! DONT BUY APPLE SCAM
Please which of the I pods will you advice me to use? Cause I really want to know between powerbeats pro,I pods pro etc?
Does it work with iPhone 6s which has iOS 13.5?
your youtube page is immaculate, sir. you deserve every coin on each google check you receive. such poise. thank you for this video which i am listening to through my Airpod Pros. ❤️

So basically its the old airpods with a cheap looking rubber tips on it, retailing for 250.<br>And the best part is, people will buy it.
I love the references 🤣🤣🤣 the new design looks much better. I think the old one is ugly, this new one is more acceptable
Hi
What&#39;s the exact name of the intro ?<br>Jordyn Edmonds is not helping be more specific please
I have pros but I like the design of the second gen better, I can’t get over the fact that it looks like bell sprout is sucking on my ear
Pro is a marketing tool
Hehehe I&#39;m getting airpod pros for my birthday
This thing is latterly shit !!!
What can i buy to keep them from falling out my ear all the time
Why do his hands look like that
I like them because they cost $250. My friends think I&#39;m cool now.  Finally. My wife loves hers by the way.
Have you done the raycon ear buds??
Hi im waiting for the update cause im planning to buy the airpods pro. I just need to hear your thoughts first. 😂😅 keep safe.
I have tried it on my flight back to China. They blocked roughly 80% of the engine noise from the plane, and once you take them off the Instant increased noise will make you appreciate that they can do such amazing things in that small size. But 270 dollars after tax it’s still quite high... I think half of the price i paid for this cause the brand.
Peashooter pros!!!
I just want to know if this could block my roomate&#39;s snor
Pro stands for Pro-hibitive price.
Am i the only one who have tried all the tips but ths slippery little suckers keep slipping out of my ears

I LITERALLY CHOKED ON MY CEREAL WHEN YOU SHOWED THE PICS OF AIRPOD MEMES 💀💀
I want ipod pro but its very very costly for me. I know they hv best sound quality. But cant but due to overprice.
I’m getting some and I’m only 10 in a hlaf
what software are you using with those?  Mine didn&#39;t have any link or anything.
My airpods come this Tuesday
Wow
Getting mine on Tuesday
Do they pain if you have them always plugged in?
Yeah I think the Sonys are better, even if the user interface is not good, I think that is the only thing the AirPods have going for them.
Google EarPods Pro falling out. 20 pages of upset customers on the Apple  Support Community and no help from Apple
First Airpods without Jony Ive’s design input. That explains it.
Guy with AirPods 2 back when they first launched: I got the new AirPods so now I’m no longer broke<br>Guy with AirPods Pro in 2019: Why does it smell so broke in here???
The intro kinda sounds like the pornhub intro
hey i love you videos the quality is amazing, i can see the time and effort you put into each video.
Very nice
XD why do we need pros <br><br>What&#39;s next airpod pro xl max?
I paid £250 which is around $300 apple be scamming me over here
All these broke people in the comment section saying they ugly cuz they can&#39;t afford them lmao
I am watching this with airpods2
I can’t decide between the power beats pro or AirPods pro. I was aiming more towards beats pro, but I don’t like the box size. To big. I need it for work and able to carry it around. What do you guys think? Which is better?
Hello, I&#39;m Apple&#39;s CEO.<br><br>We are happy to introduce you to the AirPods PRO, which are exactly the same as the normal AirPods, but we just want money.<br><br>Buy it now, for the low price of your entire live savings!
In Canada the cost 330$

I have normal ears so they are great for me!
Can you use them with Android?
marques: the air pods pro cost $250<br>Apple: ACTUALLY THEY ARE $249 YOU GOD DAMN LIAR
Idk which cube to buy for these
I thought his intro song was PH intro, i got scared for a second
Watching this with my AirPods Pro
It’s basically a noise canceling hearing aid 🤣
Can they still do the flip click on the case
Anyone else here to see wtf airpod pros are after seeing the fights to win them from Smooth Gio?
Big u need me more small
i just ordered these and they come today <b>so i am happy</b>
I phone 12
Omg, I have been dying to figure out wether or not I can connect my air pod pros with my Bose 35’s. It’s driving me mad at this point.
If you have AirPods yur gay<br>Except if they are fake
That intro music reminds me of sum
I hav it
Regular airpods will do. Don’t really need these.
I got these for my birthday but the right AirPod was making static noise<br>So I have to exchange them for new ones
Who else agrees the old ones look better?
Really good review. Very precise, informative and good comparisons, All the best
@Marques Brownlee Sony WF-1000xm3 or Apple Airpods pro?
I love the wallpaper on your mac. Where did you get it?
These are actually really good just the price is abit extreme
The ANC is a joke on these be honest and audio quality is garbage fie the price you pay
I’m interested in them on my birthday! March
They dont stay in my ears, I dont get why people like this. Either my ears are extremely weirdly shaped compared to everyone else or what. No matter the size of the tip they constantly fall out to the point I had to buy the airpods 2 again, now I have both because I can&#39;t return the pro
Great for noisy neighbors that won’t shut up!
i have beats might want air pods pro
Anyone else thought the intro sounded like ehmm....... yeah that naughty stuff
Why dont u do a full review of iphone 11 pro max
In Sweden they are 319$, like wtf man
Говно
Free giv yes now very many
Nice
What’s the name of the intro track?
Im glad the airpods pro is a good product. Its even better than my headphones. The airpods has better bass than my headphones to
When you live in Canada and it’s $320
Bro ur intro remembered me with porn hub intro
Try these out in the Apple store and it will be all you think about until you buy them
Is it AirPods pro or AirPod pros
Way way way too expensive ( yet I’m about half I buy a pair)
Im gonna buy it as soon as i get enough money to buy it. Im so excited i cant wait so im watching videos till i get. 😁😁😁😁😁
When the “quietly dropped” the airpod pros I ha donuts bought regular AirPods three days before
Just the same work what wired apple handsfree does for $ 29 🤭
Hi<br>this thing is stuck in my mind for a week. I am totally confused to put Rs.25,000 INR in AirPods pro. I just want to know if someone got my AirPods pro without my knowledge (theft), then is it possible to track my AirPods pro. Yeah, I know its easy if it is connected to @t but <br><br><br>what for the android users. Is it possible to track the AirPods pro with the serial number to which iPhone it is connected and past apple devices it got connected? ( if I got the serial number of the AirPods pro whether or not it&#39;s connected to icloud.com) <br><br><br>If I am putting such a huge amount of money only for earphones which are actually equivalent to my one-semester college fee, I expect to have this feature. <br><br><br>I googled it but I didn&#39;t really find an answer, hope you can give me one. Please take a few minutes to answer this.
Having pros doesn&#39;t make u rich tho. I mean, $250 is just what you&#39; d spend in the supermarket in a month or even more.
I wonder how much apple pay him to suck them off
Legit thought l was on Pornhub on starting music

It looks like one of those 🌱 Pokémon
The only thing pro about them are that they match the iPhone pro models in Name. You got to be Matchey matchy if you want to keep up in the Apple world.
my only issue is that there isnt a volume control (swipe up n down) which i thought it was featured
Airpod 1,2 = nabs <br>Beat solo , studio , powerbeat 3 , pro = Legends
These headphones cost more than my phone 😢😧
Airpods Pro are not compatible with Google Pixel phones. At least not yet... Confirmed by Google. You&#39;ll have volume problems that haven&#39;t be solved. You&#39;ve been warned!
Bruh in NZ I paid $330 for AirPods 2 and $40 more for the charging pad and AirPods pro are $440+<br>(Ps airpods gen 1 are $250)
Does anyone know if when connect airpods pro to laptop(windows) it has any delay?
his intro sounds like the p hub sound
I really wanted to like these but the  ANC on them are more like passive noise cancellation on other buds. I can still hear EVERYTHING!
I like that your &quot;unboxing&quot; was 30 seconds FLAT  :)
hbd me
I prefer the Bose on ear and they isolate really well
Is it me or do they look like the peashooter from plants vs zombies

Who else is watching this on their earbuds with an iPhone that isn’t even compatible with the pros?
Who else watching this video, on their iPhone 11 Pro Max?
NOOT NOOT
Bro I was a little upset, it came with the fast charger, but not the fast charger cube, and now I have to pay 30$ for it
They literally copied samsung
Mine cost €310
What is the wireless range of these?
If it’s raining cats would you be able to go outside with them on??
Apple was so much simpler when it was just a fruit
In Canada they Cost 330-350 :( not fair
AirPods user in 2018: I’m rich<br><br>AirPods user in 2019:I’m WHAT
Finally, they have buds! My ears were always waay too small for normal airpods 😭😭😭😭😭

so why does apple make a wireless charging case but then don&#39;t sell a wireless charger to charge it with?...
Tim Cook fart
I just got them and they don’t fit well at all. It fells like they are going to fall. Also the tips I’m using it says that it’s a good seal so that’s not the problem
Just honest question: who shakes their head like that running 5 yards?? Sure, they don&#39;t fit everyone, but if that&#39;s how someone is wearing them and running and hope they stay in while shaking their head like that, they have unrealistic expectations. Over ear headphones would have fallen off doing that! LOL
AirPods users: I don’t speak broke<br><br>AirPods pro users: I don’t <b>hear</b> broke
hey marques why did you put a one plus 7 pro frame in that video? (i know it&#39;s not about the 90Hz thing though so why exactly?)

white color is awesome..... if apple come with black color it will look like crap.
Can&#39;t hear broke
Is there a way to lower that painfully loud feedback sound that you get when you put the airpods on or when you change the mode?
I want the black ones .. sorry
&quot;Now these cost 250$&quot;<br>You have it easy<br>In Aus it costs double that!
Nobody:<br>Marques Brownlee: These cost 250$ dolars <b>*puts 249 in the screen</b><br>That one dolar left: Am I a joke to you
I&#39;ve never owned AirPods but I got these so I don&#39;t have much perspective. Anyway I love them... I find I have them in my ears like 50% of my waking hours now. Mostly podcasts. Even if the sound quality isn&#39;t super hi-fi, it&#39;s the ease of use and comfort I like most. I&#39;ve had ZERO Bluetooth fuckery which is usually an issue with other devices. Best of all they&#39;re just really light and comfortable... I hardly know I&#39;m wearing them. Sometimes the user experience itself really is worth the extra $$. Get the AppleCare too so you can in theory get a battery replacement before your two years are up.
As for colours I&#39;d actually like that awful beige colour (like the old Apple II plastic). It&#39;s not a colour I&#39;d usually like but it would work well for headphones I think... a sort of skin colour.
Last week, I googled &quot;magiclone&quot; and I got my airpod today. When I opened airpods, a pop-up notification / window appeared on my iPhone. It really surprised me It ’s very reasonable, and the sound is surprisingly good.
I wasn’t at all interested in the content but this video really relaxed me for some reason
Do they work with my Nokia?
I’m thinking of getting the AirPods 2 over the pros. Should I cop
Hold up, There 250 pounds in the U.K. so when transferred to dollars is 323 dollars so us brits are paying almost 75 more 😡😡😡😡😡
AirPods Pro better or powerbeats pro better ? pls give me some suggestion
best guy

Daaammm i need this to be like $100 so i can afford it

Apple is better then anything 💯%
My AirPods got stolen at work so I&#39;m just gonna buy the new Pros.. When life gives you lemons haha
HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE. I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OTHER YOUTUBER MENTION THIS! <br><br>I am a bit of a basshead, not gonna lie, but I’m very disappointed with the bass with the airpods pro. They are nowhere even close to the bass of the Powerbeats pro; anyone who says they have the same bass is horribly wrong. <br><br>However, I noticed something with the airpods pro. It’s not that they are not capable of the bass, it’s that the ADAPTIVE EQ is reducing the bass a lot. Here is how I know this... <br><br>If you have the airpods pro you can do a test. The first step is to go into your Bluetooth settings and turn OFF the automatic ear detection. <br>Next, play a song with a lot of bass, while the airpods are NOT in your ears. The adaptive eq will recognize something is up, and since it still thinks it’s in your ears, it will pump up the bass as it thinks it should to “balance things out” give it about 5 seconds to really pump up the bass, (airpods not in your ears still) and then as a big bass drop comes in, slide them in your ears QUICKLY! What you will hear is hopefully the same thing I noticed, and that is a lot of bass for a quick second; before the adaptive eq turns it down a split second later. <br>But it is enough time to tell that the airpods pro are capable of a lot of bass, it’s just the adaptive eq that tones it waaaay way down. <br><br>In my opinion, Apple should let us control the eq with an app, since we know it has the adaptive eq. If some people want more bass, we should be able to get it considering the price we are paying, and the eq feature the airpods ALREADY HAVE! Just do an update or  give us an app to control the eq Apple PLEASE! If they do that I will have no complaints with the Airpods pro. As of now I’m thinking of returning them because they don’t give enough bass. <br><br>Please try this out for yourselves if you have the Airpods Pro and see if you guys notice it too!
Is that Linus. to be honest, i would do the same XD
I wouldn’t want u thinking I had the old AirPods something, there all technically the same thing
I am getting AirPod Pro’s in a few days and I already have AirPod 2. 😂😂
Hi, I’m an artist I mix and master and test on earphones cause I got to know what it sounds like to the listeners. I FIND THE AIRPOD PROS AMAZING  they actually really make the songs sound like what they were initially intended to. Aka they pro as fuck (this time)
Apple should make marques do it and not Tim Cook <br>Who agrees with me
What do they have for range... How far away can my phone be from the pods, before I lose Bluetooth signal?
Wow, the new Airpods foreskin doesn&#39;t look too bad
I just bit the bullet and brought my self a pair of the Airpods second generation and I am fairly impressed with the airpods so far i would consider picking up the Airpod Pros based on my experience with the Airpods, I did foot the bill for the wireless charging case pair so I could have picked up the PROs for around $30.00 more on the aussie market tho.
Everybody watching on their iPhone 11 pro maxes.<br><br>Me: I got the iPhone 5s in the back, batteries are not attached.

Awesome review! But here i want to show you an even BETTER review on this specific product @t
The people who disliked this video are a prick <br>Who ever agrees like this comment
so do you think the noise cancellation would be good enough to use in school like if your walking in the halls and lots of people are talking and things like that ?
I have air pods pro on right now 🤣
Are the air pods pro better or the Bose soundsport? Any views?
I never knew I would consider buying a circumsized landscape version of the airpods .

I hate this guy. He tried hard to be white
There is a difference between earphones and headphones
Can wait for the iphone 69 💀
Are they better than etymotic research earphones in terms of sound quality and noise cancelation?
the exclusive That is truly in v5.99 my opinion is at - <b>OPTIMUMVIEWS.</b> <b>COM</b>
This guy is showing off
Good. But no good at all for sports. Unless you consider playing chess sport. They don&#39;t stay in your ear when running or cycling..
You can use them in a plane, I used them in the wing area seats and the noise cancellation was great!
Evolution of Airpods:<br><b>they added pro in the name</b>
i have samsung note 10 plus, soo is it good to buy airpods pro or samsung buds. Or i should wait for next gen samsung buds?
Warning! Don&#39;t believe that. The new air pods pro sound shit. Let me explain: I work in the remastering domain and I just tried them at the Apple Store and all what I can say it is not good at all compare to the previous air pod.  There&#39;s no dynamic, the sound isn&#39;t highlighted, without deep, no presence and flatter.  If you don&#39;t believe me, go to your Apple Store and ask to try both air pods and air pods pro and you will understand.

After using this for just one day are you very much went back to the old AirPod Noise cancellation transparency in reality is nothing compare to the comfort in your ear that you must keep them on all day long
Please do a video on the Blastpods V2! They are identical to the airpods 3 Pro 😅 Blastpods .net
Compare the sound to the music stored on the Apple Watch. That’s the secret.
I am rich <br>I can afford the wires
This works for android users???
Still sticking to my 5 dolla very wired earphones
Been a while since I laughed as much.. 250 for that.  Ah ha ha . Apple fan boys make me lol.. you can get great iems or headphones for that lol .. they do look bad as well
I wish it had volume controls from the AirPod itself. I mean they can still do a firmware update or smth so the AirPods with the existing force touch can be used to increase or decrease the volume. So say the right one is to increase the vol, the left can be used to decrease. And vice versa.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
How about quality for listening to music...?
Didn&#39;t Samsung already have all these features or am I wrong?
Anyone having an Exclamation error on Airpods pro?
I wish i could aford them i need a new laptop tho
In India they cost $345. It’s funny to see how Apple interprets $1=₹100 when it’s actually $1=₹72. I know it’s probably because of taxes but $100 extra for the already overpriced apple product? I don’t see it justified.
it&#39;s your girl who still has earphones
My thumbs up is for the video  not cuz i like the buds or something
Mifo 05 does this and they’re £40
Who is watching this video with ANY Kind of AirPods (AirPods 1, AirPods 2, and AirPods Pro)?

do they still get that residue on the inner parts of the case from opening and closing them
can you have AirPods hooked up to your phone and to the Bluetooth in your car?  Would like it to read my texts to me but listen to Pandora in the car
why doesnt he use dark mode on ios 13??
Фриковато смотрятся, а так по ходу близки к идеалу, первое поколение один хрен подлагивали частенько!
Does airpods pro work with ios 12?
Seriously are you you tubers just extensions of corporate marketing divisions
Did u need IOS 13?
Buy me one
im just spaming all the air pods pro videos on youtube because i just got them to flex on my friends
I feel so pro now, AirPods Pro, Macbook Pro, iPad Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max...I need an apple watch pro, pls
These new AirPods are ugly I’d rather get the  AirPods 2 🤷🏽‍♀️
I got mine for 299 hehe
Apple : $249<br>Marquez: $250!
Thank you! you are the best!!!
Airpods pro supports Iphone 7?
If you&#39;re a true gamer, don&#39;t buy the Airpods Pro and save up for the Razer hammerheads.
Left my unopened AirPods pro in a hotel room. Somebody’s having an amazing day today
No flex
Cool video
He seems lukewarm.  I’ll sum it up - their exquisite.
Don&#39;t you dare disrespect Pingu like that ever again
Airpods users: I don&#39;t speak broke<br><br>Airpodpro user: I don&#39;t hear broke
Damn I’m <b>N E V E R</b> getting them bishes..
Looks like they finally discovered earbuds
I too bought a pair that stopped working after the first use.  Seems the left pod does not work/ fails to connect.   Apple offered to send replacements on 7-10 business days or they are allowing me to drive the the closest store for a replacement.   So glad I bought the Apple care as well.   I think I will return them for a refund as I tend not to support terrible customer service.  <br><br>Sad really for $275 with tax and AppleCare<br><br>What is a quality replacement ?
I don’t get what people complain about the old ones falling out, they never fall out for me
AirPods pro more like fucking ugly cancer or oh air diabetes
One of my friends got the normal AirPods the day before the pros got released,I still love my beats solo tho, pro not going to  get any AirPods
Is Marques wearing an Embattled Clothing hoodie?
Your review made me purchase these..salute
Do they cancels the noises in my head?
WHY NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THE HIGH RADIATION IT EMITS TO THE BRAIN??????<br>SAME AS IF YOU PLUG YOUR HEAD TO A MICROWAVE
Wow, in the middle of the video i noticed i was looking the video on 4k! My Ethernet go to hell!
You should share your income with your viewers. Because of them you make a lot of money.
Please compare with Sony WF1000

2019: airpods pro 2230: Apple Eardrums pro
Idek if I should wait until I get the money to buy the pros or just buy the normal ones
personally, im not a fan of rubber tip ear buds. seems like you always have to have them shoved into your ear canal to actually get the full sound quality out of them. maybe it&#39;s different with the apple ones, but i&#39;m definitely not spending 250 dollars just to find out. my regular airpods will do just fine.
Thanks for the update on the new iPod Pro.
Prefer a headphone jack.
Ok but the dog at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=183">3:03</a> is so cute
Wow, they don&#39;t look retarded...
Galaxy buds 😐😐😐
Can&#39;t wait for the Airpods Max
Chinese will copy and sell it for $30
So do you think the new beats solos sound better or the new AirPods
Sold. I&#39;ll stay with my Bose headset.
Ay listen... Im on the worksite.  When loud noise comes about.... Noise cancelation automatically comes on.  FUCKIN AMAZING
Thats The same thing WTF
Junk as design
Can’t wait to be the only person using wired in the future🤣
ugly headphones probably trash af
I love this video
I mean in general, there are better in ear buds out there. I kinda just like the regular airpods because they&#39;re not all the way in my ear canal. Like even the galaxy buds sound really good, but I prefer my airpods because they just chill in my ear and I assume these would be similar lmaooo.
Make an unboxing and review of the Razer hammerhead please
If a have iPhone 7 can i use the AirPods pro?
Useless
I wonder how many people got involved in the tech to make sure people had a perfect fit on their ears
GIVE ME THEM PROS
Wtf is diffrence between turning the noise cancellation off and the transparency mode???
Now That I’m using AirPod old without so called pro .. should I feel poor
Marques please do some reaview on the new redmi airdots pro ....!!! Thanxs
ngl the first 0.1 second of the intro song sounded familiar
I really am not sure whether I should get the AirPods or the AirPods Pro.
this honestly looks like a samsung product-
Technology advancement and artificial intelligence are definitely changing the game.
Sony: Better in every way<br>Also Sony: Costs less
it is god

Wtf is wrong with ppl? Apple laughing their asses off!  What bunch of bullshit and yet, ppl are buying it. 🤦‍♂️🤣
$249 is nothing. In Sweden they costs $349...
Nope!!! I won’t pay $250 for those. There getting ridiculous with their prices
damn ios 13. From ios 13 my airpods constantly log off during my call. i have latest FW. Does anybody the same problem?
Unfortunately my pair have begun exhibiting a weird random force touch clicking on their own. Mostly happens on the left side. It’s like double and triple clicking and makes it unusable. Tried in-pair and Pair, discover and connect. Currently working with Apple support to see what’s up. Anyone else?
Brain cancer.. delivered right to your own head.

you bought phone for $250.<br>I bought ear piece for $249!
Had first gen AirPods for a while now. Only had them fall out once when I run. Sorry that happens. Love the new pros. But I will not be buying them. That’s a lot of money to drop on them. Have a great day.
Who ever liking this will probably be a millionare
Nah its not airpords pro,its a <b>pea shooter</b>

In India , airpods cost $215 even till now
Look at me here... I got the iPhone XS Max the 2 days before the 11 was launched... at least I could make it this time

Nice, I am looking forward to your full review, please compare to Microsoft, Google and anything in this or high pricier point

Cool video Markass Brownlee
watch them add a camera to the next airpods
AirPods are the <b>PEAK</b> of humanity
Why are you so silent about how they sound so shitty for the price? You have given indepth review of cheaper headphones.
Ok mark ass brownie
I just ordered a pair and as a 14 year old with a job my wallet literally screamed at me
My 6s Plus has a headphone jack still, y’all just can’t afford the wires tehehe

Ambience mode by samsung smh
Did you use your AirPods on any of your recent flights?
The air pass through, the ear bud test feature, and the noise cancellation all came from the hearing aid industry. I work for Beltone, which is a sister company to GN, the company Apple learned these technologies from.
This man is pitiful<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I have the 2069 invisible air-pods and they work as good as my invisible gaming headphones and invisible speakers
Really hyped about the new Airpods Pro
Why is there a ladder on your wall
Hey can you do a review on the new Amazon echo buds. And then maybe input on that vs air pods pro? Thanks
Imagine buying earbuds with no cords 0.0
Jokes on iPhone users <br>Samsung S9 Look the exact same but the pro are white and without wires
Would love to see how well they work with Android phones
They look like they were made by Samsung
Cut your hair dude you&#39;re beginning to look nappy or like a human eraser I feel like turning you upside down and removing scuff marks off my hardwood floor. ;-)

i just want to know if these have better sound quality than power beats
I got a set of JBL Tube 120s a few days before these dropped. I wouldn&#39;t pay the premium, the battery life is roughly the same, but I will give airpods this- they are better for single-ear listening, no doubt

Am i the only one who didn’t know Airpods Pro exist?
Waiting for your full review mate
A better review than most of the Apple Fan Boys/Girls on Youtube., as you know the ones who bought and loved that stupid Apple coffee table book which was in the hundreds of dollars. Anyway, would like to see a comparison these versus the new Amazon buds which are like almost half the price of these...
Need to know if I can go running with them.
You can legit buy a new smartphone at 250$ and get an earphone along with it for free.

Who else is listening with Galaxy Buds?
Is that the peashooter from plants vs zombies
With the rubber tips does this mean they sit deeper in the ear? I actually like the OG Air Pods cause they seem to be the last style of buds that kinda sit in your ear but don&#39;t go in the canal.
Can you find you airpods pro using the ‘find my iphone’ app whilst its in its case, As this was a problem for me and my airpods
Lol the galaxy buds have all the that and the noice cancellation is better and its cheaper😂😂imagine buying airpods pro and there exact same as the galaxy buds and its there first release🤡

Butttt i do fall asleep on plane and i have a strong fear these are going to fall off and get lost 😂😂 plus i already have the bose overear anc soooo unless i lose my current airpods prob wont get these lmfao quite expensive gohhdammm

Why do people think noise canceling has to be so great for Airplanes? Those constant noise situations are the easiest to cancel out.
You had like a frame holding a OnePlus phone at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=276">4:36</a>. Super fast.
Ugly
My orders new pair of airpods (I lost mine) <br><br>Next day me go to check the order status; Apple  :introducing Airpods Pro
Apple&#39;s basically a money trap. People get the newest product after it&#39;s released, and then they &quot;Your broke&quot; their way into pressuring you to buy them. Then once you have them, Apple releases a new product and the cycle starts. I got AirPods. Yeah, they&#39;re only series 1. Yes I bought them refurbished cause they were cheaper, but I have them ok? And is it really that big of a deal if I only have an iPhone 6s? Come on people. Just because my dad didn&#39;t buy me a $1500 phone and $250 butt-ugly AirPods doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m worthless and poor, ok?
Oh I just can wait to see these on Wish.
Bought mine as soon as they were available. My first run was today. They are great. Looking forward to my first flight with them so I can leave my Sennheisers at home.
Do planes do Bluetooth
They just cut headphones and call it a day
People complaining because they are $250 when in Australia the AirPod pros are $400 ☠️

This is a beautiful video 🔥🔥⭐🌟🌟✨
Ur the best
Air pods pro are ugly
another horror story for my financial status.
The funny thing is that if a droid company made these same things people would say, eww those look so weird. But apple made them so they fire😂👌
You sound incredibly demotivated
It&#39;s looking good but is it Sony 2019 WF219020100000 X Good
Who else is watching even though they know they can’t afford these
My airpods 2Qi kost 250$ and in sweden airpods pro kost 320$
for the money beats pro is the better option
Basically just rubber tips for an extra $100
There 400$ in australia
Put some Cream on you’re hands
I&#39;ll stick with sennheiser headphones quality sound and all goodies for much higher price
You thought u lost ur AirPods alot <br>Well these small AirPods pro are even easier to lose so make sure u buy 60x pairs and You’ll be good for a week 1MILLION pairs that’s like 100days
I feel like Apple&#39;s accessories are better than their phones.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=183">3:03</a> so we’re gonna act like we didn’t see that ?

Buy the next version
Apple:air pOds pRo<br>Me: W H E E Z E
$250?? Bruh
Air pods pro are disgusting 🤢 wtf they are actually so weird
apple&#39;s PRO branding is stupid. They should have made it stand for something...like all pro devices have USB-C...otherwise all pro means is an ipad that bends and airpods with less battery life than the normal model.
Literally got AirPods 2 last week
marka** brownie
You are black<br><br>But I love you
uncircumcised fucking airpods
HAHAHAHAHA THIS SHIT LOOKS WACK AS FUCKKK
That is just tipical I just bought myself the normal AirPods 😂
Do they fall out like the original AirPods do? That&#39;s my biggest gripe of the old ones.
Still don&#39;t sound better than MDR-7510
Still don&#39;t sound better than MDR-7510
I do not like them.

So, the old ones looked like a toothbrush in your ear. These look like a barbie hairdryer. What&#39;s next? Apple Shaving Foam?
They make them only in white because they are made for all the white people who want to spend absurd amounts of money on mediocre products just so that they can force a false sense of superiority on other people who are smart enough to NOT buy this bullshit.
Mark Ass Brownie
or maybe... <b>P E N G U</b>
Ordered those one pretty excited 🤟
My mate literally bought AirPods a day before AirPods pro
I don&#39;t give a Crap Them Airpods Are Dumb Apple is Stupid   😭😂
Pretty sure Apple will drop a airpods pro max.
I&#39;m still convinced that the AKG earphones that come with Samsung devices are better than anything apple could put out.
Question: do they work with android?
I feel like the rubber tips cheapen them 🤢 they give me android vibes ...
Hey look, Apple is finally joining 2019 now that it&#39;s almost 2020 lol. The original airpod design that they&#39;ve been using for years with their other basic earbuds was defective by design they don&#39;t stay in for crap, I tested them out in the apple store and they were not only hard AF to get in the right position to create any seal at all but even the slightest movement at all and they fall out. Now apple users can enjoy a superior design now that they have finally started using gel tips. Still don&#39;t have much hope as far as sound quality or battery life if the old airpods are anything to go by cause they were meh at best. $250 is a steep price to ask so they better come big with quality and battery but that open hole in the back just seems like a major flaw right from the start. Anyone that knows earbuds the secret to good sound is creating a good seal, having an open air hole defeats the purpose. Also how can there be any passive noise canceling with an open back design with that hole, hint: there can&#39;t be.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUhzYdcX6w&amp;t=276">4:36</a> you can see a picture of him with a one plus phone lol
