I love how he build snowman as his army to fight the enderdragon
Wow this was an epic journey, its a tradition to watch this series every year.
Such a nostalgic😢<br>Married and now hes a dad<br>Miss those old days<br>This memory and journey brought me to tear💧😢<br>Wish i cant time travel back to beginning of pewdiepie journey❤
2024 and rewatch this series 😂😂😂😂
EPIC GAMER MOMENT
Rip <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=779">12:59</a>
hurts every fucking time dude
Pewdiepie made me realise if he can do it with one arrow, a trident, and a bunch of snow golems, I can too.
Rewatching this series in 2024. Forgot how emotional it was
The end of this episode was so emotional
<b>Peepeepoopoo</b> made Felix do a death note reference?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=856">14:16</a> level? Seen this about 4 times but never noticed.
Watching again this series dec 21 2023, I will come back again next year if I needed this
rewatched the whole series after 4 years, that was emotional rollercoaster. See u in next 4 years
can anyone tell me what&#39;s the song in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1070">17:50</a>?
I feel sad for your pets; (
This dude&#39;s a dad, married and living in Japan BUT I still remember him calling a d*mn pig &quot;PeePeePooPoo&quot;, and to this day, I too call pigs PeePeePooPoos.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=775">12:55</a> ender pearls :/
Losing all your gear to the void is a right of passage for minecraft players through the millenniums. A time honored tradition that separates the big pps from the rest.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1134">18:54</a> im crying
Thank you Pewds for these wholesome series! Loved it eversince day 1
The best minecraft series has a best culmination, thanks, Felix
That really showed a true power in minecraft boats
Still here 2023 legend
RIP Piggy
Could have used ender pearl to survive. Newb confirmed
RIP JOERGEN<br>RIP JOERGEN II<br>RIP UNDEAD JOERGEN<br>RIP IKEA BIRD<br>RIP IKEA BIRD #2<br>RIP DJ COW<br>RIP BOAT COW<br>RIP WATERSHEEP<br>RIP ROLF<br>And most importantly<br>RIP KING PEEPEEPOOPOO<br><br>I may be 4 years late, but I&#39;m not late enough to enjoy all this 30 parts of Pewdiepie Minecraft Series
the &quot;get in the boat&quot; is classic pewds🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. I&#39;ve been watching this series more than 10 times
Pipi pupu says yes and drops you
literally gasped when he fell into the void
Let&#39;s just take a moment to remember that Felix&#39;s first words ever spoken in The End were &quot;Pee Pee Poo Poo&quot;
to me, this this is cinema
He could have just used an ender pearl to get out of there
A story of a man and a wolf who never gave up.
pee pee poo poo is a savage
Peepee poopoo got him twice lol
🥲
Dude he should’ve used the pearls instead of dying 💀😭
the end part is emotional
Sorry I misspelled  the dog&#39;s name
It&#39;s so sad all day of his animals die but the one person who survived it all of  sven
Ender Dragon! more like Endore Dragon this mob is bad
This has been a pleasure to watch ✊
He did it for Sven&#39;s safety
The biggest loss in the history of Minecraft;<br>It&#39;s not Philza&#39;s hardcore world<br>It&#39;s not Joergen 1 or 2<br><br>It&#39;s peepeepoopoo.
🥚
Fuck me when pee pee Poo Poo died I couldn’t stop laughing
best minecraft series ever, i never stop to rewatch it, hope pewds continue this series
its probably good that he got pushed in by peepeepoopoo because he would have just fallen off the platform with peepeepoopoo even if he didnt theres no way a pig would survive
This was the #1 best Minecraft series ever on YouTube.
did he do the bed strat first or did speedrunners bc i honestly cant remember
Why is Pewdiepie.... like.... ssooo boring now? He used to make jokes and shit..... Now he&#39;s just screaming.... and playing casually..... with no gimmick..... 😒😒😒
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=782">13:02</a> dumb ways to die
Binge watching rn
Our hair is coming in nicely.
This video can make a grown man cry❤
Mr peepeepoo was a big plot twist, his betrayal will be remembered
Thank you for this masterpiece felix ❤
when he fell off the bridge with all his good loot i felt part of my soul disintigrate.
U had ender pearls
Notice the netherack?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=623">10:23</a> sheesshhh I literally screaming 😭😭
everyone: use a water bucket to avoid enderman<br><br>Pewds: &quot;GET ON THE BOAT&quot;
P P 💩💩

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=886">14:46</a> Death Note reference
death note reference : I&#39;ll take a porkchop and eat it
He could’ve used an ender eye to teleport bro
its cool how hes wearing the same shirt as he did in ep 1
The peepeepoopoo story line: Peepeepoopoo is discovered and quickly becomes one of pewdiepies right hand men. He then tragically dies in a healing potion accident. But peepeepoopoo is reincarnated, whoever wears his saddle becomes peepeepoopoo. Many more generations are forms, and the army of peepeepoopoos help take down the mighty wither. The final incarnate of peepeepoopoo goes to the stronghold with pewdiepie, but, corrupted by power, he sees his opportunity to seize control by pushing pewdiepie into the mysterious portal. When Felix returns, peepeepoopoo is in shock, and is pushed into the portal. While pewdiepie continues to fight, peepeepoopoo goes into the poopoo state and all of the past reincarnations combine, making him able to survive the elder dragons blast. He is freed from corruption and they are about to ride into battle, when he tragically falls into the void and he is killed in the poopoo state, which means he can never be reincarnated or reborn again.
Nooooooooo peepeepoopoo
I actually cried watchinv this 4 years later
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=798">13:18</a> the fact that he could have used the eye
That was EPIC

Why am I crying?

بكيت و أنا أضحك😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💗💗
The slideshow got me not gonna lie.
here still in 2023
It may be corny but, 3 yrs ago, watching these videos was the most peaceful thing for me. I still every once in awhile find myself going back to watch parts. IKEA tower forever

Epic Betrayal.

Back here once again in 2023 as always it was a good binge watch thank you pewds 🙂
Just finished watching the series now it&#39;s time to watch the hardcore series
Peepeepoopoo Made it happen now Felix is gonna kill the enderdragon without sven and joergen and without peepeepoopoo just with snowmans and then pewdiepie pushed peepeepoopoo in the end portal
My favorite Minecraft series but it&#39;s totally faked
😌

i never knew this man can make minecraft so intense and emotional..
Bro actually doesn&#39;t throw the ended pearl right after he continues after pausing.
I&#39;ve watched again and again and yet I can never get enough of this... God bless you man. Also watched this serious while playing My Singing Monsters... GAMING WEEK NEVER DIES. What a throw back!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=800">13:20</a> he couldve used the pearls to teleport back onto the island😂
3 years.
The time he prepared for end dragon with an inventory full of boats and actually won... Cursed sweden game
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=775">12:55</a> Felix you are an idiot for riding the traitor. He planned to kill you all along.
did i fr just cry over a minecraft let’s play
How come he doesn&#39;t have cobblestone and bed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=915">15:15</a> but have in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=968">16:08</a> and his Weapon damage still the same and food is still 60? And when you look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=940">15:40</a> he has fishing rod and ender eyes at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=961">16:01</a> when clearly at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=915">15:15</a> he hasn&#39;t bring any of those.
Peepeepoopoo was probably tecnoblade. He might of betrayed felix But he sacrificed himself for him to win😭
I’m not crying you are
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1194">19:54</a> im crying with You felix

Is pee pee poo the pig or the saddle just asking?
The sadness you get from finishing a game...
PeePeePooPoo betrayed Pewds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1138">18:58</a> why is this so sad, I actually wanna cry. Wtf :(
Rewatching back this series brings back so many memorable memories. Ong this is one of the best YouTube series ever created. The ending hit me soo hard
What is he saying at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=679">11:19</a>
I think that it’s kind of sus that Felix suddenly required a stack of blocks when he had no resources. 🤔
I just want to know what Marzia is thinking when she hears Felix screaming <b>PEEPEEPOOPOO</b> from the other room
Why it is so emotional?!
WHY AM I CRYING WHY AM I CRYING
Sweden I live in Sweden
Lots of Sacrifies
I mean Void Sheep
Make a Coid Sheep
Felix cheated, After he died and went to the portal again, He had 11 blocks and after he got there, he had 75 blocks.
You see how peepeepoopoo noded as pewds threw the pearl like it was all going to be fine
Fuck Bernie, peepee poopoo died the most heroic... o7
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1090">18:10</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1136">18:56</a> made me cry way more then It should&#39;ve
Man.... what a series this is seriously like... everything about this series is just perfect.....and ofc like he said it was an Epic journey just loved it soo much thank you ✨✨✨✨😘🎉
And that’s why you always keep a bucket of water
Viewers: what did it cost (to kill the dragon) pewdiepie: everything 😔

this is like my 7th time rewatching the series and i still get teary eyes when i watch it
⭐  9.9 /10    98  %  🍅    🌜
Losing all that enchanted loot hurt me and it wasn&#39;t even my loot.
Can we all talk about the fact that he used snow men and boats which were completely his ideas and they frickin worked... It&#39;s like he learned some random things through this journey and used all of them in this fight... This could be an anime lol(I have never played minecraft .. So it looked cool to me)
Best Minecraft series of all time….
while I&#39;m watching this video it started raining and rumbling outside<br>indeed the final boss
At the end I was crying then it turned into tears of joy
Tbh the best video on YouTube
Two years later I realized he could’ve ender pearled instead of losing all the stuff to the void💀
Breaking news! Swedish man tries to put a dragon triple his size in a boat 🤣🤣
PewDiePie Still has pets how?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=770">12:50</a>
i’ll never get bored of rewatching this series
That compilation at the end actually got me sad
You shouldn&#39;t kill Jean the ender dragon because shes the last of her kind and if you think the egg will keep the species alive your wrong there aren&#39;t any males to fertilize the egg
legendary
U really lived in the game it is like ur one life
The last arrow he shot contained all his dead friends, without them he couldn/ t made it
Nver thought i would auctually cry watching pewdiepie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=774">12:54</a> When he paused the game to reflect on his mistake.. I cackled so hard
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=772">12:52</a> I mean you could have pearled easily... It&#39;s in your hotbar
no one’s talking about his promise to all those pets that they would kill the ender dragon together got fulfilled when he was shooting arrows
😭😭😭😭😭
När du föll ner i the void så hade du kunnat använda din ender pearl och ta dig upp!
As a swedish fan its funny hearing those   grandma names he gives to the animals
There are many life lessons to be made from this minecraft series.
Felix this is a tip  If you don&#39;t have sword or a trident use your axe Its gonna do good damage
In my opinion; this is the series finale for his channel. Mans got married, hit 100M subs and beat minecraft in the same week. Truly iconic moment in his channel’s history. Thank you Pewds🖤
&quot; We&#39;re gonna beat the ender dragon together. &quot;<br><br>They actually did.
How did he have 11 Netherack in one frame and then 64 + 11 Netherack in the next? Seems a bit odd, Felix
Bro you really deserve to be NUMBER 1 you were always n1 you are and you will be ever, Absolute masterpiece his pets were same as any animals in Minecraft but how he showed love, feelings and emotions they are like real Characters and never ever ever I loved a series this much &quot;&quot;THIS IS SOO EPIC&quot;&quot;<br>Love you Pewds❤️❤️
Still think this is the best series on youtube! Enjoyed it sooo much
i’m so emotional.
2022 and I&#39;m still here enjoying this vid like I used to
this is amazing
you are not worthy of water sheeps power you are unworthy 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
Peepee poopoos death actually made me sad
rip peepeepoopoo :(
.r.i.p. peepeepoopooo
😭😭😭😭😭😭
felix: has emotional moment when pee pee poo poo dies sbutitles: pronuonces pee pee poo poo as baby papa
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=774">12:54</a> i actually could not stop laughing for 10 min RIP
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=773">12:53</a> the saddest moment in this entire series
It’s 2022 and I still can’t get over this gem of a series. Thank you so so much Felix. It’s honestly brought me joy and comfort. I’ve loved this series and will continue to love it.
His excellency Almighty Peepeepoopoo decided it was time to bless  Piedie by forging him into a REAL MAN, a LEGEND that faces hardships head on without fear or hesitation.
This was epic day and sad day
the best moment in minecraft gameplay
Peepeepoopoo how could you do this to your father, who protected you and fed you, you betrayed him once and he forgave you, then you betray him a 2nd time??
I love this part I cried the end with all the animals
when Felix said his not ready and opens the ender chest : I already preapared.
The enderman are all twerking in the boats
Okey so there is war in ukraine. BUT PEEPEEPOOPOO DIED!!!! and here i am 18 years old, crying watching minecraft!! no regrets
It&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s already been 2 years since pewdiepie revived minecraft
why is the title in Indonesian?
Dude lost all of his loot and he cared that the fucking pig died? Feels like he&#39;s playing pet simulator instead of Minecraft.
I still don’t understand why Felix let himself fall off the platform with pepepopo, he had ender pearls
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=427">7:07</a> omg the arrow
2 years later, and it still brings a tear to my eye when I see the memories flashing at the end
Peepeepoopoo😂😂😂hahaha dude😐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=886">14:46</a> death note reference?
The DeathNote reference tho <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=886">14:46</a>
Still crying for the ending tho<br>Even after 5x rewatch :&#39;)<br>The last pic of joergen hit hard
This can make a grown man cry.
That was so emotional
commenting on 2022, crying about the end but then sike, he continiues, im so happy
and tha legend was over <br>or was it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1010">16:50</a> PewDiePie Killed the Ender Dragon!!!!!
Very nice
i feel dead inside what do i watch now
why am i crying
Pewds suddenly having 64 nether blocks🤣🤣🤣🤣
although i watch it last time, now i can finally understand that pee pee poo poo doesn&#39;t push felix into the portal. coz i heared the press button. It&#39;s the exact timing but still, still entertaining
Love this episode!
I hate pewdiepie
i literally teared
This was my 2nd time through in 2022. Literally so good, this series will hold up until the end of time! God bless you Felix, my children will watch this someday. Peepeepoopoo will NEVER DIE!!

The ending is beautiful 😅🥺❤️❤️❤️
Man the nostalgia..and it’s been two years
I legitimately cried. Wtf that was too emotional mate.
2022 and started binge-watching this again. cried yet again.
This makes me cry 😥But IT IS SOO HAPPY
He had Ender pearls he could&#39;ve survived the fall
I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 years
Betrayed twice by PeePeePooPoo….. heartbreaking
Other youtubers:kills the enderman  dragon using swords.<br>Pewdiepie:My snowmans,rumble across the end until all subjects of end are eliminated!!!
sven is a girl
NICE JOB FELIX
what a great series... the ending makes me sad but still its a great journey to watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=843">14:03</a> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If you see in the very first episode, Pee pee poo poo in in the thumbnail! R.I.P pee pee poo poo 🐷❤

Is it just me or who else cried
Pee   pee  POO  POO!!!!!!!noooòoo!!!!

Lol <b>”Veteran”</b> didn’t even ender eye clutch back onto mainland when him and PeepeePooPoo fell off. More like newb lol who is the clown?
STILL A FUN RIDE
One word : epik
When you bring a trident to a dragon fight &quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=258">4:18</a> &quot;
The best part is when he shows all the best pets that died😭🤧
are he died from void or not, because look at his level
watching this almost 2 years later is sad asf wow-
Questions 1
Peepeepoopoo last word before dieing  was &quot;yes&quot;
Rip all friends
Legendary Minecraft moments in history ill never forget this as i grow up
boat cow
rewatched the whole series and still think its the best thing ever created
2022 and this is still enough to make a grown man cry
January 2022, <br>im in my bed having Covid, crying and realizing that this series was the last thing before the pandemic that made me happy. Future me if you’re out there, does life ever get better to the same point as it were when this series got out? And if you’re seeing this comment again, I’m glad to know you’ve come back to the very series that had made you happy from the start.
This is the best Minecraft lets play other than dantdm and stampey
who else keep watching this hole series without boring🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1083">18:03</a> this made me in tears
Peepeepoopoo, has infinite lives, just like water sheep these god like animals are immortal peepeepoopoo is alive as long as there are no graves for him to rest in without his physical form, jourgen #1 escaped his grave creating jourgen #2 and #3. Felix has an unnatural touch, when he grows toward something/someone it breaks/die but it will always be reborn, in physical form or in a grave. Sven has broken his destiny, to never die. Please Felix find your loved ones.
Peepeepoopoo was plotting from the start
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=735">12:15</a> anyone notice that the trident have Sharpness 5 &amp; Quick Charge 3
I love how minecraft requires creativity<br><br>He defeted ender dragon using: boats, snow and bed
Rest In Peace to all who died in this series such a nice first season ending😂😂😂😂😂😂
He said when he beats the game he will release his coordinates!
This has been such a great series so far.<br><br>Met some amazing animal friends...<br><br>Lost some...<br><br>But the true legends...<br><br>Live on
100 million, Married with Marzia and killing the ender dragon in the same week..Dude 😎
this series made me cry again ;_; best way to celebrate my new year &lt;3
I WANTED TO SAY HIS REACTION TO THE END POEM
pewds: I&#39;ll take a paorkcop and eat it<br>Light: iam so proud
I&#39;ll be back again in December next year. This is such a beautiful series.
pewds: hit him with the bed!<br><br><b>literally hits him with the bed</b>
OMG I want to cry......
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=797">13:17</a> you have ender pearl, why you don&#39;t teleporttttttttttttttttttt
Amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=775">12:55</a> When the Reaper gives you a moment to think about your life before taking you forever
Not me rewatching this series for like the 4th or 5th time
Never has there been a better series
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=770">12:50</a> sad moment 😆😂
When peepeepoopoo died it was so dramatic that i was kinda sad lol <br><br>True animemoment

This is amazing
Anyone coming back to this ending now and crying!? I can’t believe what an emotional roller coaster that was, full kudos to Felix for being such a masterful story teller to the point where I’m getting bleary eyed over a couple of pixel animals! 😂😭
he had ender pearls
I like how im watching this in the end of 2021
Here in November 2021 to relive this moment
I can&#39;t believe Felix made me tear up for a Minecraft pig called Peepeepoopoo. Why is this so good!
Where boys cried: Monster’s Inc. ending<br>Where men cried: Toy Story 3 ending<br>Where legends cried: Pewdiepie’s Minecraft Part 30 ending
he had a pearl cauld have saved himself ez
love you pewdiepie

The most emotional, happy, epic and intense ender dragon fight i have ever seen :) :(
Joergen up in heaven looking down while Felix is shooting fireworks must be thinking &quot;Not bad kid :)&quot;

Congratulations, u did it And I try to beat Jean (This is official Dragon name), I hope I win in Minecraft
should have just when you were about to lose everything switch to the ender pearls that were right next to the shovel that you were holding and just throw it at the island
If someone says Minecraft is just a game, she them this series.
Imagine if he didn’t have the pearl to teleport.
When you fell with Pepepopo you course of used a ender pearl
SEED PLZ.......
Pro
can i mine this?
whoa pewdiepie has 110m subs congrats
Omg, way to copy James Wilson Uberhaxornova. Your whole channel is just copying him. He did fireworks too in 2012, and they were better too. I am not starting any old shit, Pewds, but I am disappointed that you broke your promise to quit copying. &lt;/3 :&#39;(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=796">13:16</a> real men cried

❤🍪🥔❤
watching this 2 years later and remembering me breaking down sobbing at the ending of this wow its surreal its been so long and im still emotionally attached to this series
Wow i don&#39;t even watch game plays always, but I&#39;m sobbing.
I legit liked this series 10x more than the hardcore one.....
This is so emotional 😅😭
me watching this series for the 50th time and still cries at the end screen
Lmaoo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=180">3:00</a> pewds looked at the ender and the ender man was like “how you dare try to look at me?” “I’ll let it pass for this one time”
The real story is the story of Felix’s hair styles
Wow PewDiePie
cheater
hey you. you came here to read the comments. let me tell you they&#39;re either about what he have done this week or the death of peepeepoopoo. now get out of here
RIP pee pee poo poo
He could have pearled to safety they were one space over on his hotbar
I have genuinely never laughed harder than after seeing the instant regret on his face the second he rode peepeepoopoo off that cliff
peepeepoopoo :,(
o nvm
YOU DIDNT USE YOUR PEARLS
Use ur purls
where did felix play brofist
Can we talk about pewds names his trident power of watersheep
Pewds: I am a veteran <br>Also Pewds:Rides pig in the end
what probably hurt worse was that he had 8 ender pearls as he was falling and didn&#39;t notice it
Peepeepoopoo is a betrayer that we Didnt voted out
Who&#39;s watching in 2021
Эмм русский язык в названии что то новое

I am thankful for this series more than anything in the history of YouTube.<br><br>Watching Felix learn from the beginning, thinking it would be a funny ironic play-through, then enjoying every moment...<br><br>It&#39;s like getting to experience what Minecraft felt like to me when I first played it. I just got to this episode for the second time and forgot just how emotional it is and it hit me just as hard as the first time.
Mom: what did u do today <br>Me: I watch a grown man play minecraft and get betrayed by a pig name peepeepoopoo
Music and montage of old friends gets me every time. It&#39;s the fifth time that I watch this series and every death hits as hard as if it was the first time

If you here this 2021 your a legend🇵🇭❤
Here in March 28th to remember this epic moment in history
Hahhahahahahahhahahahhahaua
Yooo dis  is epic
Pewds: my aim is 2020<br>2020 the year: yea ur aim is the worst
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1200">20:00</a> His smile is real OMG
rip peepee poop
JoJo reference everywhere, even the betrayal<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>GOODBYE JOJO!!!!
This episode teach us to never give up
The ending was so emotional I cried. No, I sobbed.
Descripcion spanish ????
He changed the thumbnail
&quot;I’ll Eat A PorkChop, And Eat It.&quot;
What an episode!!! First of all, getting &quot;pushed&quot; into the end portal and being totally unprepared for it. Then miraculously finding stuff in the ender chest. Destroying the beacons with a trident. Summoning an army of snow golems. Being hit by the dragon&#39;s wings and dying from fall damage. Coming back and retrieving your items. Riding Peepeepoopoo into the void (I thought the ender eyes would save you but alas no). Then came the boat strategy, which was frigging hilarious! Finally, the bed strategy and a final arrow to finish this epic fight! This is the BEST end dragon battle I have ever seen!!! ♥
Awwr so many JoJo&#39;s reference
Why am I so emotionally involved in peepeepoopoos death? :(
you can do it pewpie we blievei in yuo
He should have changed it to creative when they fell so he didn’t die and he had already changed it so he didn’t have achievements anyways

There will never be a more emotional and epic Minecraft let&#39;s play
Why does seeing some dead pixelated animals make me so sad :(
the ending gets me everytime, i get so damn emotional man ;-; When i first watched this I was hyped :) This was an interesting journey :&#39;)
here when pewds defeat her again...😃
Who thinks that these all were prepared before
Reccomending me this after pewds defeated the ender dragon in hardcore <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Cool
WHOS HERE AFTER WATCHING PEWDIEPIE HARDCORE
Such a beautiful series!!

The hardcore version is good, but this is brilliant
Who else is here after Pewd&#39;s new ender dragon fight

Who&#39;s here after he challenged the ender dragon again in hardcore mode
This is the biggest achievement ever for a Minecraft Player 😁😁

Best anime ever  10+/10
I cant believe this video still make me cry
Efi Anamer
Bonkey watching this video before going with pews
season 1 was great
Fake il écrit pas en français
Pewds: Haha You&#39;re approaching me?<br>Me: what? You think im nervous? Your audience....
Watersheep? more like, <b>Watershed video.</b>
No joke this vid made me cry
this my most saddest reaction to a gaming video. digging up all the memory, remembering failing friends........ but you get strength from it. That is something vulnerable moral of this story that.... you will lose friends, the closest to you, the one you love the most will have to leave you one day. So you have to be prepared for this. Goodnight gamers....brofist
If you did not watch this moment you are not a real pewdiepie fan.
Pewds in the battle: &quot;This is for all the people that were like fathers to me, that I loved like my sons, and stupidly killed&quot; Well, that&#39;s season 3 of Minecraftの世界のフェリックス done, and Minecraft ended with it.
Olum domuz yüzünden ölüyo ben olsam  şu ana karar bulduğum bütün domuzlara işlence ederdim
Merhaba
I remember when this first came out
Peepeepoopoo was working for water sheep
I mean, the man got 100 million subscribers, got married, and beat the Ender dragon all in one year.
2021 here, to see this legend
d
R.I.P Peepee Poopoo
Pepepopo: falling <br>Pewdiepie: I’m sorry my old friend <br>Pepepopo: see you on the other side
Pewds: *gets 69 exp<br>Me: &quot;There are no accidents..&quot;
Still cried harder at your wedding video
Hahahahahahaha

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=952">15:52</a> what a clutch
Looking back at this, I have never been so emotionally attached to something that isn&#39;t even real. This series has been a rollercoaster ride, it&#39;s been fun.

Fun fact: guys the Ender Dragon is a She and the Ender Dragons Name is Jean since the Ender Dragon is a She which would explain why theres an Ender Dragon Egg in The End!!!

WHEN YOU WERE FALLING YOU SHOULDVE WENT YO SETTINGS AND PUT KEEP INVENTORY WHY
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=736">12:16</a> Pewds how did you get Sharpness 5 and Quick charge 3 on a trident?
Rest in peace peepeepoopoo😭
This isn’t just a gameplay, it’s how memories are made. We’re gonna look back to these videos when we’re older and cry. Just thinking about the memories we all had. <br><br>Memento Mori, Sven and Jeorgen forever.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1074">17:54</a><br>This enough to make a grown man cry.<br><br>I’m not a grown man, but I’m still crying.
Ma sei inglese o italiano?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=735">12:15</a> how does he have sharpness and quick charge on a trident?
Was pewds saying i&#39;ll take a porkchop and eat it a death note reference?
Thank you Felix for all the memories. I was like 10 maybe younger when I first watched your videos. Loved amnesia, loved everything. I’m about to be 20 and I’ll always watch you! &lt;3
I swear he looked at every endermen
I think peepeepoopoo betrayed him as mistake because he turned around to leave because he was too scared and as he turned around he by mistake pushed Pewds.
that was epic when he summoned so many snow golems and they started shooting.
Where boys become men...
Ok, I legit cried.
The funnynthing is he used snow golems
I never beat minecraft
Dude you forgot that you said if you die in full diamond you end searios
This never gets old.
Maybe he could make army of iron golems
The saddest minecraft video i ever seen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=768">12:48</a> la traición
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVxaK8WQhJo&amp;t=1139">18:59</a> I will take your revenge  PewDiePie 😥😪😫😞😞😞😞
This is sad and good at the same time
Rip PEBE POOBOO he will not be forgotten he worked so hard and fell to the void
Not gonna lie i cried
One like for Pepe po-po who sacrificed his life for the honour of Felix<br>RIP : Pepepopo
I cry when I see this
To this day peepee poo poo is still falling in the depths of the void...
the end of an era
