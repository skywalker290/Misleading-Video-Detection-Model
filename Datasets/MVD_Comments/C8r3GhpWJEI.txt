Dav went back in time and jacked the silvver bullet i made when i made J as an angel with William and the rest were solid white. I know where all of it exists. Josh Wyatt is the murderer??. It could be Jason Miller??. Both got life sentences 20 years ago. Josh Singletary performa black magic projects.

Ricky Gervais is a genius . You completely missed the point of the performance Pewdy. 😅😅😅That’s  really funny . It’s about making jokes not about preaching.

That fretted guitar would have a better chance of being musically significant if it was made out of fruit rollups. Which static disharmonic interval could be of any consequence whatsoever? Or play more than 1 harmonic.

I know it’s kinda late but thanks for donating to help through those fires as it effected a lot of people.
If you don’t use sweat shops those people starve

I feel like I died inside, bc I remember watching stuff like this when I was around 18-20, now I’m 28, decided to rewatch these videos just to see if I react differently, and I can’t even crack a smile, damn
I like pewds, but why do you have to blaspheme every 10 seconds!

Fun Fact: There is a phenomenon called Paris Syndrome where people are so immensely disappointed by how different Paris is from media representation that they experience anxiety, derealization, hallucination, etc.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8r3GhpWJEI&amp;t=406">6:46</a> That‘s why they’re called Cell phones
OMG A MACEDONIAN VID ON PEWDS CHANNEL????? The marriage proposal vid was such a meme hahahha
I do care where my stuff comes from
Nice number
You can be angry about sweatshops and still buy Chinese made goods. A major issue is a lot of stuff we use and need are Chinese made so its not as easy as just don&#39;t buy it.
Distreeminate*
gotta say that felix is bloody right about paris, the whole city is in work, there is almost not a single street where there are no work on buildings etc, there are trashes everywhere, idfk what happened to Paris, but the mayor is doing shit to help the city.
Pewdiepie: I feel generous today.<br><br>MrBeast: Am i a joke to you?

I agree Paris sucks
“That was a lame episode when he was manager”<br>Bruh he was manager for like 2 seasons
So why are you so hypocritical of sweatshops in China when you have your shop set up in CANADA. The worst country for c02 emissions per person and they treat indigenous peoples like shit

You already know mf’ers in jail commenting on this video.
Baseball is one of those sports that’s more fun to play than watch. When ur in person a baseball game is fun to watch. Hockey games are fun all around.
&quot;Paris is no longer Paris, it&#39;s gross&quot;<br><br>Bold to assume that Paris was ever clean at any point in history. I&#39;m pretty sure Paris has just been keeping its identity intact, thank you very much.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8r3GhpWJEI&amp;t=580">9:40</a> he wasn&#39;t saying that he doesn&#39;t buy from China, he was saying that the actors shouldn&#39;t preach about being moral while they have all there products made in sweat shops
I got this reccomended this a year later<br>Must have been because its episode 69
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8r3GhpWJEI&amp;t=647">10:47</a> :)))

I have to agree with the whole thing about sports like I’m an American and all I give a crap about is one college football team but fr watching rugby is so much more entertaining and it’s so much shorter.

The fact they choose to manufacture Tsuki in Canada proves brands don’t need their customers to force them into better business habits. They simply choose not to until their business begins to tank.

Hiiii
EPISODE 69!!!
I feel like Pewds made a big mistake in this video for defending slavery in China. Ricky’s Point was that they’re hypocrites for not caring about slavery in China or where their products come from.<br><br>It’s kind of like saying that slavery in the US in the 19th century was okay because the people in Great Britain didn’t care where their cotton imports came from.
I alrdy lost it at “shiver me timbers”!!! 🤣🤣🤣
this is the 69th ylyl he could have done somthing better

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8r3GhpWJEI&amp;t=626">10:26</a> it&#39;s fucking true tho lol.  i remember one night i went outside for a cigarette during one of the games.  i didn&#39;t even know it was on - i haven&#39;t followed baseball since i was like thirteen.  some crazy shit happened, i can&#39;t remember what, but i do remember having the absolute shit scared out of me when every neighborhood in earshot just fucking went nuts all at the same time.  it was an interesting experience, the sound was just so indescribable.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8r3GhpWJEI&amp;t=583">9:43</a> Why do you produce ethically in Canada? Canadians can have decent-paying jobs.<br>Why not produce ethically in China so that those who have to go to work in sweatshops come and work for your ethical company?
