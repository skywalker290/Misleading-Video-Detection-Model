To hear that Felix doesn&#39;t believe that Russians interfered in the USA elections of 2016 is saddening. The PBS Frontline news team released a series of interviews on Youtube about Putin in 2018 where the evidence for this is laid out in absolute clarity. If it took the war with Ukraine to persuade people like Felix that Russia is run by an evil elite of fascists, humanity is in deep doo-doo.
Good luck with Texas’ OK. hat.

Best part of video was how I couldn&#39;t see lower face half the time
Pet rats are not dirty or gross. Wild rats are. But pet rats have been breed to be the exact opposite of all of the stigma they get. They honestly are more easily trained than a dog and they can be potty trained, trick trained, and so much more. Pet rats= good ; wild rats= not good.
wow he wants to send kids to islands. epstine likes this idea lol

I love skate 3 one of my favorite things about the game is how on the mega Park level if you hold the right bumper button on your controller and run into a blue car and get on your board at the same time you can go flying.

The bubonic plague wasn&#39;t spread by rat fleas as is the narrative. Rats really travel more than 100m from where they were born. however, in a time when humans wouldn&#39;t wash very much or change clothes, ticks and fleas were a way of life (considered gods wrath on humanity for the sins people commit). We can also look at the writings of the times, They talk of mountains of dead people in the streets, yet if rats were the carriers, they would be dying more than humans, so there would be mountains of dead rats all over the place. Nowhere is this mentioned. Where ever humans went, so did the plague. Through simulations of different carriers based at the time, it is a certainty that it was spread via human fleas.
Skate 3 was THE best skating game ever, you can&#39;t change that.
