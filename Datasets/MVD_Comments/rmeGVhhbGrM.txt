&quot;Learn to embrace the randomness&quot;
It&#39;s my dream to be their and share my journey ❤
In 10 years i am going to give a tedx talk in English this is a promise to myself.
Something that i gonna be apply over my entire life that&#39;s it&#39;s okay to be a crazy, it&#39;s okay to do everything in once in your life, it&#39;s absolutely okay to cry sometimes in your bathroom too it&#39;s okay to annotate your books it&#39;s okay and gonna be crazy to try drums in your life even though you don&#39;t know the &quot;M&quot; of the music..  it&#39;s okay to be free and having no friends... That&#39;s okay to leave your old friends and meet up  with new one.. it&#39;s okay to act, like someone is recording you even though nobody is 😂✨ it&#39;s okay to eat alone it&#39;s okay to clean your table it&#39;s okay to behave like kid or silly one.. you can&#39;t make everyone happy there will  be always a person who is unhappy!🌷💌🦭
This Random Video Inspired Me To Work Again On My YouTube Channel... Tq god for showing me the right path.. Happy New Year ❤🙏🏻😇
added to wishlist : i will be on ted talks in 5 years !
What the bass🛢️🥁 songs are coming. They don&#39;t have to make such as mistakes. A head of scene responsible person must pay attention these things 😔<br>But the for speaker. Big respect. She&#39;s adhering to her principles❤❤❤
Cute Girl<br>Always appreciated her acting
She is acting like ranveer alhabadiya
I literally bored to listen her skill, she is doing it same everywhere since last decade , really boaring it now
You look like palak manchal

In Ted x marathi song ❤
It&#39;s easy when you have talent and passion but It&#39;s difficult when you don&#39;t have a passion or talent and you have no interest in anything. What to do then being of age 20 and don&#39;t know what to do is hard 🙂
I really like the way she naturally tell her life story, about her passion and belief goes with the flow in life path, and will definitely get to know our real talent &amp; get success in life. <br><br>On 12th November 2025, I will also speak in TEDx and inspire people by my life story. Willpower, passion &amp; kindness are the tools with which I have beat the unwanted period of life &amp; achieve my dreams.,
One day i will be there
You can&#39;t catch anything unless you think you can
Starting part तर viral व्हायला पाहिजे 😊
It&#39;s my dream , one day I will speak in this show ❤❤and i definitely  prove myself this commitment
Na you don&#39;t need a plan but plans many plans
Do not fear rejections, cultivate resilience, try different things, accept the randomness, find your niche...

Great speech ❤
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, your story is so relatable to  me..
Yes it&#39;s correct.. passion is important than plan more .. <br><br>But to achieve it you must have plan to beat today&#39;s competitive world 🌎
I also wanted to show my talent on this stage❤
She&#39;s confidence her thought and her decision
Expressed the true experiences. Almost all successful people face these steps, stages, and challenges - most we don&#39;t know. This young lady expressed all her experiences in a very simple way and told us the whole story.
🎉
3-4 yrs back I saw this thumbnail and thought what rubbish just a waste of time this video is....today I feel the need to see this video as I can relate, its okay not to have a plan. It will all be okay eventually
She is so beautiful
❤❤❤❤❤
This is the best ted talk on you tube.
Thanku mam your music estimate  is very  nice 👍 and your English spech is very  good 👍 mind-blowing
And your voice is very sweetness thanku
Thanks mam   I am very glad for yourmeugik estimate   and your English spech is too much
She is a very good actress. Acted well in telugu.
As for me,  I really like painting, but I&#39;m focusing on my study,reading  all those meaning less books just to get good CGPA. Thus I can get a good job, and the truth is I don’t want to do a job either, I&#39;m forcibly doing this because if I don&#39;t do so Everyone including my parents will be disappointed, And I afraid that if I don&#39;t get a job they will make fun of me as saying what is the benefit of Study if u can&#39;t get a job!! Or maybe I just overthink!!! 😔😔😔😔😞
Now acting is a job there are people who do degree in that
Totally loved the way she spoke...
12 min 9.million views 😮😮

I watched her show &quot;little things&quot; so it like I know her that&#39;s why I just click on this video to know how she make a path to reach there but when I saw her here &amp; talking about her life experience and i just thank her that she make me feel stressed free &amp; it is okay that you rejected many times, because no one care until u make it big.she gave very beautiful senerio that we often faced in our life like rikshaw .

Good your face expression
me , while having made the decision to follow what i like , right now , this gave me the courage and boost required,,i was so scared if i was doing the right thing if the risk is worth it if ,, if it even is possible to run after my passion , i just realised thats what i am supposed to do exactly ,, run after what u truly want , not what others expect u to want ,, uk what i mean?
tu lag bag jata.. mage valun n pahata.. vat pawalat adakhalali...😍😍her voice is so soothing.. n her character always gives good vibes only..

Mithila&#39;s English, Hindi, Marathi is so good.

Nyz section....

Very best motivetion
Going to be at this plateform one day❤️
One day i will be the one to talk about my story.
My dream is  I speak  very well English your shows one day...............
Even I&#39;ve learned it the very hard way that you can never satisfy the whole world ! All you can do is to satisfy yourself and be happy! Happiness is a choice and it should be your priority too, my teacher and I had a extremely deep conversation about happiness and that was the day I understood the meaning of true happiness.
im from iran  actually i was see one movie of she ( Chopsticks  )<br><br>i am shocked because she was acting very flexible like a fresh <br><br> i cant explain that but im not see any girl like she negative in cinema in a long time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmeGVhhbGrM&amp;t=185">3:05</a>
One day, every shows will under my feet I promise
One day I will speak this show

Mithila Palkar u beauty😍
It is probably just that planning helps you reduce your tensions and probably increases your productivity and happiness.
IELTS Aspirants like here😅
One day I will speak in this show.
One day I will go to  this show
Passion, hobbies, quality education,good University..these things are not for a middle class family person of india... Here middle class after passing 12th struggle to get job as soon as possible to help their family to sustain... It&#39;s okay not to have plan that&#39;s most ridiculous statement in current scenario..she should have said this speech only for who are not middle class family or poor family of India
One day I&#39;ll definitely be speaking and sharing my life journey over this show.
okay but why is the audience ded
Thank you so much
Tamilnadu ku va ka 😍😍😘
because even i am confused what to do next😓😓
found this at the best time
Yes. Il b thr one day. Mark it Akshata.
Every one don&#39;t take steps of their passion and also experiment.....☹️
👏❤️
Life didn&#39;t give you opportunity you should create it don&#39;t wait others to help you. I have to tell you something is significantly important don&#39;t comparing your life with anyone if you do that believe me you will insult yourself .
No matter who are you no matter how much money do you have at the back account . No matter if you are a famous person or ordinary person <br>The most important thing is your brain and culture on the other hand don&#39;t ask others to respect you if you didn&#39;t respect them . There are many things couldn&#39;t you buying it&#39;s a health , love, respect .
Simply if you have no pholosphy to others and express your won personality try to build your special features don&#39;t give up on struggling against the situation aren&#39;t give you the success
Self motivated is your plan without living for a goal or purpose you will suffer from lack of hope .
I just love mithila from my soul,,😍
One day I&#39;ll also want to tell my story to others.....
one day mee to going to share my life journy....✨🌝🤞🤞☝✌✌
Perfect speech 🔥⭐👍🏻

Her intension is honest that we don&#39;t have any plane but atleast we have passion. Then life could be  more easier for you. But what if we have plan, but things are not going on our way?

I m so excited my broken marriage has been restored. &quot;We recently made up, even though it was difficult. It&#39;s been more than a month now, and everything feels like it&#39;s returned to normal. He has begun to treat me better, and it&#39;s  been a healing process for both of us. The night mare that had lasted for almost 2 years before we broke up is finally over. It&#39;s like we fell in love all over again! We &#39;ve both put the past behind us, and are trying  to move forward_ and for the first time in long time, the future look alot brighter.i can&#39;t express in world&#39;s how grateful I am Dr uduebor for revive it&#39;s like we &#39;ve finally rediscovered those things about each other that made us fall in  love in the first place. All of the worry and stress has simply vanished. Thank you Dr uduebor for saving my broken marriage and bringing my husband back to me! &quot;  Me and my husband are living together happily again.  All thanks to Dr uduebor.if you have any problem with hearth issues as well.  Contact (dr.uduebor@gmail.com) or Whatsapp (+2349044159370)...
can you please show the audience when they raise their hand or something

Amazing performance.....

THANKYOU FOR THIS, MITHILA!
One day, I&#39;ll get a mail to speak at TED
Wow she spoke so well it really inspires me❤️
Ohh I know her 🖤
😃😎
Gandu plan jaruri hai
I&#39;m the one who has passion for everything. I have versatility without specification which is dangerous for many I know. But till I&#39;m enjoying everything why should I leave. When situations are trying harder 2 limit u then exploring is not the option, u must enjoy whats happening 2 u right now. What happening 2 u is the things falling 2 u...Only if u know whats falling 2 u is good or not then u get 2 know how things should be.

Make yourself happy.
We cannot make everyone happy😊😊But we can make ourself happy by doing what we want😀😀
I have utmost desire to be speaker in this show
No one literally <br>No none🙄<br>Me: trying to learn the cup trick
One day I hope that I can speak in this show
How beautiful she is  !  And his English is fabulous  .  I became fond of his language  .
Suuuuppppr 🔥🔥🔥
Everytime I came to this video only to listen her sweet song although I don&#39;t understand Marathi.<br>🥰
After watching this i still don&#39;t know what to do with my life 😂
Viewing this video again n again just to listen her song,, even without the cup music, her voice and expressions are so beautiful ✨😍
But when you have no passion and any greed to anything that&#39;s when you feel stuck and perception of world become hollow eventually. It&#39;s really hard to pass a single minute without any plan and passion to pursue. I hope at least one person understand ☹️just hopeless for myself I just want a motive to live every second. I just hope I would find it😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
One day I will speak in Ted talks
and i am confused as to what my passion is.
Beauty with brain😘
I just came here because I love Mithila&#39;s way of speaking ........she is my lady love❤️
I did not understand a word but loved every inch of that song
Song smaj m bilkul ni aaya but amazing
Good motivation and also a cutee heart

Jit jd channel from Mumbai
Good background secreen very good
She&#39;s so brave, has a lot of faith in herself and these qualities of her is which made her what she&#39;s now. Lot of respect to you Mithila palkar.
aurat ka chakkar babu bhaiya. aurat ka chakkar. insaan ko aabad kar deta hai ya barbaad kar deta hai. ameesha patel would be really glad about it.
Her English fluency is just amazing 😍😍😂
If you don&#39;t plan, then you better not have a family bcoz 99% people would probably be over-run by competition &amp; end up broke ../\..

how many of you came here because she looks pretty !!! :P
Awesome  thoughts towards life.....liked it diiiii😍😍😘😘😘😘😘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💜💜💜💓💓💓💓🤗🤗💖💖💖💖🥰🥰🤩🤩
One day ,I am sure that I will share my success story on this stage.
Iske face me itna glow kaise hai?
Yeah you should be ready to face rejection s every single day
My inner soul says,you will definitely be capable to speak at this platform💗
Most importantly, learn to embrace the randomness.
I can understand everything she said, her accent reminds me of my english teacher and how acehnese speaks.
The abrupt bay perceptually type because sweatshirt gergely squash along a legal ferryboat. smiling, mighty lipstick
🔥🔥
I believe that at some point it is really important to plan your life, not everyone is lucky enough to get successful with the experiments and later regret not having a plan.
I agree that Ameesha Patel is doing great these days, but you shouldn&#39;t have said her name like that.. this is a TEDx talk, not a comedy show where people laugh by belittling others.
When your profession involves terms such as &quot;Random Forest&quot; gotta &quot;Embrace the Randomness&quot; in every aspect of your life ;). Damn ! I guess now I&#39;m crushing severely on this amazing person :) ~~|||
good
Wow ,what a great song and what !the skill lovely<br>Love u
Man Hindi Mai Bhai bolo
Really enthusiastic and lovely speech .I am a big fan of yours. keep it up
Oh wow  her voice has some magic when it seemed like she was speaking to me.............................<br>Comment down if you also do
I don&#39;t know in which language she was singing....but love that 😍
This is really motivational💕 Much needed.
Which song is it?
At the start it was waoo...but I can&#39;t understand it🤯😁
I wish to speak here one day
2nd most viewed ted talk after bb of an indian . ♥️♥️
Please tell me the song name 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Please tell me the song name 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmeGVhhbGrM&amp;t=525">8:45</a> <br>That channel is Filtercopy....😀
I think I am in love with her, time to get a rakhi.<br>-Sohan Tari
I love her girl in the city web series and a fan of her, since then
My celeb crush is Jeon Jungkook but I can’t afford to move to South Korea 🥺
Can anyone translate this pls
She is boring and I&#39;m snoring😴
Ye maal h
even i want to become a singer and somewhere mine story is also related to her. like my family wants my graduation and decent job. i always do what my elder sister does. and also I am planning to inform my parents about my dream since I am about to pass 10th this year. plzz pray for me.
she speaks as if she is lecturing 10-year-olds.
This is called Lying through the teeth - &quot;Just on whim I made this cup song&quot;. Copied directly from Pitch Perfect movie.<br>But.. but...if she ever reads this comment,  I&#39;d be at the laughing end. Why? Because she would say &quot;I am famous now, do what you want to do.&quot;<br>Most of the comments here are about - Her voice is sweet, she looks pretty, awesome speech, she is honest. If this is what majority likes, I am glad not to be a part of majority.
Silchar ❤️
I love ur story mam
Any tamilnadu 🔥 fans
Superb👌
In Little things she is super cute and being a marathi girl i am proud of her❤️❤️❤️❤️
Backchodi bhari baatein...ye sab to main b bol dunga
I agree to each and every single word that she spoke. I followed my passion of teaching leaving engineering and felt very happy
hahahaha  is ko  English  be nehi  ati  ha
i am back agaian to this with soulmate !
Thoughtful!
Why India people say in english 😠😠😠
Believe in urself... Which I do....
Yep she is right. We can&#39;t make everyone happy that&#39;s ok. We just do the things that make us really happy.
Very soon I will come here for sure
NIT Silchar technical glitch (mike), although its very nice to see how Mithila set herself back after the break without faulty hand mike.
one day i&#39;ll make it here..
I will definetly speak in this show one day
❤️❤️🙏🙏👍🙏👍
Commendable thought
Great
Her voice is shaking with nervousness 😫
wow. Outstanding <br>Adds to my knowledge of NICHE and PASSION. Great video. Well done Mithila. You are outstanding. God bless you
The moral of this TED &quot;Internet par kuchh bhi upload karo log use dekhenge aur appreciate karenge, kyuki log to chu*iya hai&quot; 😂

Good evening madam aapke jeshi English bolni hai 😇😇
Great
Very nice song
Why ppl are doing a 9to5 job<br>May be they&#39;ve not yet discovered their passion<br>May be they don&#39;t have time to follow their passion because they&#39;re financially struggling<br>May be they are too afraid to follow their passion<br>May be the family is not supportive esp when you&#39;re born in a conservative orthodox family<br>May be they&#39;ve already come a long way....and they&#39;ve already given their all to a particular field...and now to give up all of that would be a waste of all that effort and money they&#39;ve put in to achieving that position or reputation in the society<br>What is your story...you can comment below.
She is so cute....
Zor Ka tumka zada zor se lag gya aur mai yaha aa  gya😁
Nainsupp ♥️
As many I am also one of them who is confused what to do in life, may be bcz of not able to figured out what&#39;s my passion is, till date!!<br>Instead of feeling restless, and giving up the effort..what I found interesting today is let&#39;s try one&#39;s more nd put all my effort so that I can be called as a guest on my favourite TED talks show🤞
&quot;Life happens to you when you are busy planning other things&quot; .....
❤️❤️❤️❤️

RIDER GIRL VISHAKA
Wow! This is the best speech in ted talk that I&#39;ve heard. You taught me a lot that you don&#39;t need to get stressed yourself thinking what are your plans but to go along with and don&#39;t stop working on. And then you&#39;ll definitely in the right path..
One day realyi will speak in these show
♥️♥️♥️
Mam i had a plan and just one plan and that failed miserably....noww i have nothingggggg no job no dream no way nothing.
&#39;It is very important to do things which make you happy but the bad is that it&#39;s not that easy really. To stay always happy is a damn hard thing. If you wanna happy, so all you have to do is find your passion and start working on it. God bless you all!

What she has achieved?
Thank you Mithila. Very impactful speech 😍
its okay not to have a plan if you are lucky rich
Khup Chan 🥰🥰🥰🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰🙂🙂🙂😇😇😘🙂🙂
It&#39;s so good to hear a successful and ideal life do not need a plan but in stead we need great passion and strong beliefs.  The question left is how we heal something inside us that keeps us away from that passion and those beliefs, isn&#39;t it?  Fortunately, life is a miracle and it doesn&#39;t follow by any plan too!!
This talk is so relevant to current scenario 💯🤦
One day I will also speak in these show...
❤️ lots of love to Mithila
جميل جداا 😍😍🌹🌹
Phenomenal 🎉🎉👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Jai hind.....

My celebrity crush is Mithila Palkar
You are talented. You are beautiful. You are famous but definitely not thriving as much as you should. Now I know the reason.
Is no one gonna talk about how wonderful that song was
Nice video .
Ted Talks are things that people aspire to speak at from a very young age and the fact that I see so many comments saying that opportunity is restricted only to people who are already popular is very displeasing and disheartening. All of them want to make a change. Why not change this practice?<br>In fact even I have aspired to be one but after seeing all those comments I am not happy about it.
I LOVED IT DANGGG ♡♡
very bad speach
why r they laughing when c said amisha patel and now c is legend what does c mean
All the best...
Dream to reach the platform of TEDx show, and I will definitely. I will do whatever it was. 💯
But yar I really Don&#39;t know<br>I have Talent to be Scientist or Haven&#39;t I don&#39;t know <br>But spirit 💯% Hai 🙃✨
I write comment &quot; I want to be a great Scientist&quot;<br>NOT CAUSE of your sister But Really I want to Being scientist.
I write comment &quot; I want to be a great Scientist&quot;<br>NOT CAUSE of your sister But Really I want to Being scientist
I don&#39;t know English language but still I try 😅<br>R.i.p. English
It&#39;s true that it&#39;s ok if we don&#39;t have plan bcoz life will take u to the stage  <br>Where u don&#39;t know and it&#39;s a gift from a god so be positive
TED  で語っている方は皆さん自信家ですね、それを感心して聴いている方たち、大丈夫ですか？？　すべて疑いを持ちつつ聞いて下さいませ。
Nice wonderful.. <br>Performance 🙏
Better Speech 👍
ह्या असल्या गजब व्यक्तित्वाची ओळख मला आत्तापर्यंत नव्हती.. !<br>Thanks tedx
गजब❤️...
she is so cute
What is the name of the song, she sang at starting?
This is a good speech for do better English and this di is good speaker please don&#39;t comments other absurd talking
Ye Nits ke kaunse auditorium me ahoot hua hai bhai?
Can anyone tell me. what can I do to come on this stage.
Came here for English... luckily got motivated too!!!
Her voice is as beautiful as she is...
Nice speech
I LOVE YOU ... great to hear in a simplicity of the world of yours in the inspiring way of life what we have
excellent, innocent and WOW. Talking of auditions , the frequent mic interruptions during the video,were the only sore parts.
I have a unique talent called finger dance but it didn’t get me anywhere even uploading In YouTube or Facebook didn’t got me anywhere so I stopped.
I’m from Hailakandi it’s near by Silchar
very nice 👌👍👍👍
Nice
Her voice sounds like alia bhat
❤🦾 THANKYOU SO MUCH MITHILA!
Hello are you suffering in all kinds of problems and sickness. I was a man who suffered alot of different problems till a man recommend me to a great Man who helped me solved all my problems but now iam free from those problems I suffered before. So this is a great opportunity for you it didn&#39;t matter the kind of sickness and  pain and sorrow in your life all will be solved WhatsApp him on this number+2348022023403 and tell him all you problems and sickness you have been through it will be solved
Great👍👍
What&#39;s the song in the song? I loved listening to it but didn&#39;t understand it.
Thank you mithila we love u 😁👍👍👍
Just seeing the starting repetitively
FREAK😂
She is so beautiful ...her voice is really fascinating and her smile on each petty things was really lovable❤️❤️❤️..
I am learning english form this videos
tedX India is a cartel and a joke anyone from TV or Showbiz becomes qualified to tell rest of us as to how to become successful when there are people making greater impact in science technology and walks of life that have far greater meaning and positive impact.
What a Tallent 👏👏👏
I keep coming back to listen to this song of hers.<br>I hope to speak there once in life
I have a crush on you mithila mam😭...hope one day we&#39;ll meet😅❤️

Lot of people say that you need a plan . But you say that we don&#39;t need a plan.  It&#39;s helpful to being in real<br> life. Now I don&#39;t afraid to future. Now I will enjoy my present.
Hindi mein bolate to Main Bhi samajh paati
The cup composition was good but I&#39;ve seen the same in pitch perfect movie. So, you cannot claim that as &quot;experimenting&quot;. Anyway, your speech and presentation was very good...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmeGVhhbGrM&amp;t=375">6:15</a>  god the audience were a sport. Just look at her face.. she was waiting for a reaction
My Dream would come true when I come and share my journey on this show.
Yeah, if we plan for something to happen sometime, so we wouldn&#39;t be able to manage the surprises within it. There would be only those choices which you see, but what we would do to deal if it comes out with differences In it. So sometimes while planning remember what picture we are having now, won&#39;t be there someday.
Rubbish !!<br>TEDx is loosing image by inviting such people who has considerable achievements and Zero contribution to society.
very inspiring speech👍👍
Waw soooo great speaking <br>But I m  10 years under in this stage and I share my story
Alia bhatt??
Adaptability is very important as dynamics of life changes every second like the atmospheric pressure...👍👍👍
I only know that you are so beautiful madam............your attitude and speaking style I like very much.... I have seen this single video 10 timed
Speaking in front of  the people  especially in ENGLISH  LANGUAGE    is not  a piece of cake.....<br>It needed <br>1....faith in yourself<br>2.... good vocabulary<br>3...smart posture .<br>4....understanding of framing sentences <br>5....keep MIND AND BODY  coordinate....
Who came here after  wtchng  kaarwan movie😍🥰

I promise myself that one day I willll speak here, it&#39;s not an overconfidence but a hope and faith on myself without knowing what I want to be exactly in my life.
Sushant needs justice ..... Mumbai based actors have murdered him as he was talented !
Please use hindi language
Wow, today I saw a different Mithila here. I was very impressed by her confidence. It made my day..🥰
In a talk show everyone starts with &quot; a friend of mine......&quot; Come up with something new guys. Were you taking hints from previous videos to talk? I don&#39;t know why Tedx brings on useless lustful bollywood actresses while we have lot of real life winners and original motivators. I&#39;m happy that I am not studying in any IIT or IIM for this specific reason.
Was she making fun of Amisha Patel indirectly? If someone&#39;s career went down are we supposed to make fun and there was also sarcasm in her tone when she said my friend&#39;s love of life was Amisha Patel, audience laughed..! This is not a good practice.
badi badi baatein, wada pav khate :D
Tik mark wish of my bucket list 🤞
Ur voice is very beautiful..
Anyone here after &#39;little things&#39;???
football

I like your talent and your sweet voice 🤘👍
You are passionate that&#39;s your success with your passion. Doing really well. It&#39;s okay to sometimes something happening without a plan. I liked your entire speech. Love your cup song mostly. It&#39;s tremendous and unique. It inspires me. You also my crush:)
One day I want to come here and speak about my life
The start was superb! The table tapping and the Singing in complete sinc. Superb Mithali..
Never pick someone&#39;s name to get your attention.
Mithila Pulkar powerful speech is insping. Verily ,she has been an inspiring singer, film star  and orator   <br>Her song by using cup  is attractive and useful one <br>Thanks a lot to Mithila Pulkar<br>ALI,  P.N ,Paleri
I had a plan for going to abroad and settled life but unfortunately that plan has failed because of corona now I am<br>Totally ☹️
Good one. 🧡😊
It is okay not to have a plan. Worrying about future creates sadness. It is good to experiment and, struggle.
Really inspirational and awesome presentation👌👌✌✌💝💝💝
I came here after watching &#39;Karwaan&#39; , where she acted. It was Great to come across this show. Thank you ma&#39;am for your inspiring story.
awesome
It&#39;s always ok not to have a plan when you&#39;re fair skinned and don&#39;t belong to a poor family. Reality is far more different than what is communicated by few so called successful people. I&#39;m not trying to be pessimistic, but just speak the truth.
वाह 👍👌
The way she speaks is adorable she is such adorable person😍
She&#39;s absolutely unwatchable. Ted talks standards have dropped so miserably
At begining she makes me smile😊😊😊
I don&#39;t know the language but  i love to listen her 😀
I love it when she speaks Marathi, it sounds so cute❤️
Her voice is irritating but talk is good.
Supper
Why r u using &#39;he&#39; pronoun for amisha patel , it should be &#39;she&#39; .
Very nice
👏👏👏👏👏👏
More power to you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Superb.....sis
PPL are having a great time in the life dr yaaa even i have
Even I want to speak here one day
Love you Mithila❤️ Proud of you girl❤️✨
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ma sha Allah 💖
The speakers we see are 1 of lakhs or maybe crores that become successful. What about rest of people. We have to accept the work that might not be appealing but pays for our food.
👌👌👌👌👌👌❤❤👌❤👌❤
supiri vadak
I all want to parent my view in this show.  To   having experience of life.
Wow wow wow🥰🥰🥰🥰
It&#39;s ok not to have plan, if you have enough foods, shelters, and clothes for you &amp; your Family👪.
What if Ameesha Patel sees this??
You are Sach a beautiful and your voice🥰...how could be someone perfect and chaming &amp; great sense of humor  at the same time
Woww superb simple speachless speech given 👏 👏
So down to earth ❤❤
I am impressed with ad speech of the man before the content start
<b>Plan</b> - <b>forced us to make very important decisions  very early in life</b>
Sensible speech🤔🤔🤔
🤘superb
you are my inspiration to create my own YouTube channel
After parasite - &quot;No plan at all&quot;.....
Hey people,  <br>I really want to know how y&#39;all got your passion of life!
Can AnyOne tell me SONG or kavita name She sings
The like 👍 is for mithila palkar&#39;s talk.. good one dear
She has done a nice movie karwaan
this is best video i seem in this day :) so related and inspiring
nice
I have a celebrity crush and his is .....  🤭🤭🤩🙊🙈🙈
I don&#39;t have a passion.what to do now? How to find my passion
Thanks to Rickshaw wala😁
I have a network problem so can anybody tell me what that women is talking about?
Nice talk.... totallyyyy loveddd the entry song.... but &quot;decent job&quot;. Why? A decent job can be a passion to some. I remember being jobless and just prayed for a decent job coz any job is a necessity. My passion is crafting but to be one, you need some sort of money and income.
Love that song🎶
After karwan I am here
I think u must be good
Omg the kid from Baroda you’re talking about, it has to be Abhishek Saha, right? 😅
she is very cute 😍😍🤗🤗
its ok not having a plan when your rich
I don&#39;t know why but her &quot;decent job vala&quot; expression is quite irritating... Bro.. even getting that &quot;decent 9 to 5 job&quot; is not easy....
The audience was bad
I just love her acting as well as her hair.. Oh God. Amazing.. Girl in the city ~a series in which she runs aftr her dream.. Amazing...
I&#39;m love in with you
Nice
🙂
Lovely voice ...😘
I just want to say that i love you... I am the greatest fan u will ever have..
Bless you darling
Awesome
I am Speak this stage Of since 2024, I am confident .
All u need is a static passion
I know it is a very late comment on this video. Anyway I recommend to watch this video atleast twice. First time for the subtitles &amp; second time for her cutest of cutest expressions😍
i wish my bae wear and hair up like u coz i liked it, but i hate when people luk at her and i just let her wear niqab so she go too privacy for bad eyes
ur expressions take the attention
I can&#39;t understand the language....but the sound is good
Wow nice
superb
Mada  i like your bodymoment
U should be a malayali girl.
I will also give a speech on TEDx Talk one day
Shabbas pori. 💞👌👌🙏
She is so natural n inspiring , I&#39;m not much into movies or glam world but though googled her .<br>She gave her best shot and able to send the msg across in the most simple and beautiful way , can typically relate to her coming from a middle class Maharashtrian family .<br>Kudos to her and hope she keeps getting more success in her endeavours !
Where there is truth , there is victory very  well teach...
We had written a poem for teenagers...have a look  on our channel nd do support guys the name of poetry is BHAG! TERI TEENAGE AYI😇🤙
1no..........💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I liked Mithila more as Kavya than this, sorry for being honest.
I&#39;m watching and listening to her because she and her talks are cute 😂❤️
Ye sil4 kab ayi be
Ohh my god! How she present the song.<br>  I can&#39;t understand the lyrics but 🎶song🎵  is so beautiful❤️❤️ and give beautiful feeling.
Very insightful , would love to have you on my channel one one
She is sooo cute yrrrr😘
I knew rickshaw waalas were coming when she said rejections - Mumbaikar
Does it mean SILCHAR Assam.
I never had plans but I am still unsuccessful
super talented
I always subconsciously believed that I am less than others because of my indecisiveness. Maybe this will help me not to believe so. Thank you for being your turest and most honest self
you must have a plan, if you don&#39;t have a plan then you will be a part of somebody else plan. Its better to have a plan
You are so quit and your thoughts was freedom and chill thanks for motivating and your little things web services also I watched so pretty and good
fg
Ohhh m g that song😄😍😍😍
Ya Mari favourite hai I really like her
Thanks
Thank u mam
Loved it!
Yes.. its ok to not plan anything but keep looking for one. Inspiring!
She really amazing orator
❤
Love you mam
While she was singing and I am blushing....<br>She was looking soo cute♥️♥️♥️♥️
Learn to embrace the randomness 👌👌👌👌
I just loooove this girl
Nice confident and self satisfaction....
marathi / hindi
I get what she&#39;s trying to say but this is just privileged nonsense.<br><br><br>A lot of things that people think take courage or passion or experimentation, just take a lot of money. If you have the option to fall back on a safety net, you have the freedom to experiment. For someone who doesn&#39;t have basic necessities at hand, there&#39;s no room for experimentation irrespective of what fancy story you tell them.
Maharashtrian&#39;s and Mumbai 😘
Kavya ji.... I am a very big fan of Yours...U have been so cute in the LITTLE THINGS...You say- Dhruv, yea pet me kitthe jaayenge mere...u are so damnn cute Kavya ji...I hope I ll get a chance to meet u one day
Not to have a plane and being successful is happened by chance but have a plane and being successful is more general
I came here again to listen her song
Everytime when she makes click sound with his tongue after a sentence, I so wanna kiss her beautiful mouth everytime. <br>Mithila you&#39;re my Amisha Patel and I will come to get you one day.
Loved the TedTalk... Short yet effective!
👎
I Am Not Able To Believe That She Is Kavya From Little Things <br>More Power To You ❤️❤️
I have a huge crush on you Mithila❤️
You know what kind of plan never fails?<br>No plan. No plan at all.
Woooow nice
Marathi song is exemplary

Meera seghal in Girl in the city..... I love that character, she follows her heart..
She is my crush (kavya)
U r d crush of my life Mithila ❤️
It&#39;s a request that you should call alakh pandey in Ted x. He is a great n papoular physics teacher on YouTube channel &quot;physics wallah &quot; he had got 2.3M subscriber. He prepairs jee n Neet chemistry n physics. So I think that my suggestion n request that you should call alakh sir for tex x that he inspired all of us
Super madam
&quot;Sometimes making  random decisions may  turns into right consequences&quot;....thats what i understood from her speech
Here i have to plan, no decent job, no work, already graduated... 😒😒
How is she doing that glass thing..wow
why tedx have such a calm audience...any protocol followed by them?
खूपच मस्त ☺️☺️☺️☺️
Brave little girl !!!

Very inspirational I want to say
Wow wonderful speech
The sound you make with class is amazing
She is pretty good 🥰😘
good singing.. and most of the time plan fails but Passion never fails as it never considers compensation..
I want her jacket. Someone plz help
It&#39;s Ok not to plan... but a Tragedy not to pursue one&#39;s Passion.  Dots will Connect. &quot;Stay Hungry and Stay Foolish&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s What She Wanted to Say
Mic changed to collar mike in the midst
Well said Madam , many students  like us having no plan but still working.... without ambition
its not ok , a plan might not happen but its the reason why things &quot;change &quot; otherwise its not called changing .
Very nice song and music, god bless you.
Supb

She is sooo real❤🔥

marathi mulgi :-)
I did not know she has this talent of singing and making music with items simultaneously ❤️
The way she exits....😉
Bakwaas 👎👎👎👎👎
Such a amazing speaker <br>I loved this episode 😍<br><br>Lots of love
She hynotised audiene :)<br>No one is talking or murmuring
These days any random person can give a Ted talk.. without any qualities
love to embrace the randomness
Liked her acting in Karwaan. She portrayed her character so well !
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻soo.....good......<br>Amazing........
The Audience seems to the English test match watching boozed group.....
She is an intelligent Cute operative ....
Nicceceee yaar
yes, you are right but it is applicable for those who were born with golden spoon in their mouth.
Heart touching speech 😍
I HAVE A QSTIN...  How could somebdy come infront of tEdx  talks.   ??? <br>ACTUALLYY I WOLUD LIKE T GET A CHANCE... 💯🤘🤩🤩
It&#39;s not okay to think like this. If you are trying things out, it&#39;s fine. But you cant be directionless and do things which mean nothing. If you dont picturize yourself doing something in your head, you would not be able to do it.
very good maam
well, she is my only celebrity crush.
How many of you keep smiling throughout the video ☺️☺️☺️
Anyone from VNIT Nagpur
Ale she is so cute yar😍
Mithila your video doesn&#39;t get attention because it was new or was very great cup song.<br>It got views and attention because you are too cute😍😍<br>Your cuteness and raw charm has helped you to make it here.
How perfectly she said ...just love the way and very powerful words...huge respect miss mithila
