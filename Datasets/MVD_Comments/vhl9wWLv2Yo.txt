That meme was saying Americans can&#39;t buy or drink alcohol at 18 but they can die in a war...
Felix : You are not joker<br>Kids during high school in ASIA : Are you sure about that.
Did he sit on the dog
memes never ends because pain is everywhere
Re self-driving car issue, it&#39;s a false dichotomy. You wouldn&#39;t design it to decide whether to sacrifice the driver or the person they&#39;re hitting. You&#39;d design it to avoid both. Whether or not it succeeds one way or the other isn&#39;t entirely a result of how it was designed. There are other factors.
he said I never seen a well behave chihuahua and now he own one 😂
Yes.  Dr. Mario was the best.👍

I love that you touched on pet obesity. The amount of dogs I put on insulin a week is disgusting. Thanks!!
start the end of the video<br>me: Wait WHat th FcK is that Shit game, Literaly.
On yhe real though. Stop overfeeding your cats. They will lasagna and complain, but that is because they are a cat. If you want something that doesn&#39;t complain when it is hungry, get a vasectomy or the female snip-snip and a robodog.
Although I see what Mercedes was thinking, if the vehicle can still manage to protect the driver, it would be better to swerve away, saving both the driver and pedestrian instead of running over the pedestrian when the driver could potentially be safe even in the event of a crash.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhl9wWLv2Yo&amp;t=173">2:53</a> surely high school cant be bad for everyone

if you kill a killer than there are still the same amount of killers in the world. What if you&#39;ve killed before killing the killer.
Dr.Mario was my favorite game on Nintendo I think we had
+1thirsty hobbo🧵🎗
pewds likes doctor mario
If you’re willing to take the risk of buying a self driving car, that’s on you. The pedestrians around the car didn’t choose to take the risk. They just happened to be there. The car should kill the driver, not the pedestrians.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhl9wWLv2Yo&amp;t=835">13:55</a> it honestly would be more like who would survive you in a car getting in a crash or an old person getting hit which would most likely instantly die if tesla has a very safe car it definitly should drive away from the old person or stop if possible of course but like if you were in a car driving you probably would swerve out of the way to not hit the old person so that should be the appropriate thing to do

It’s also good to have a voice in the tech review/unboxing space that doesn’t constantly shit on Apple.  But his videos defending $50k Mac Pro, monitor stand and case wheels had me eye-rolling big time.
Bruh my Chihuahua is nice anyone can pick him up he doesn&#39;t  bite and  he does what we tell him to do (he doesn&#39;t know cool tricks tho)

I was made fun of for liking the Powerpuff Girls from 2nd grade to 5th grade. (I still love the PPG tho)<br>I was like 8 and the main bully who made fun of me for liking PPG LOVED Pokémon.. his reason for bullying me was so stupid though, he made fun of the PPG because it was old. POKÉMON IS OLDER!<br>and then a group of girls made fun of me because one of them told me to look up PPG Books in the school library, and then when there was no result they all just laughed at me.<br><br>Not fun times, kinda wished I&#39;d bunch their faces. Except the guy, he learned to be nicer to me and not be rude for no reason and I respect that.

Something is wrong with that car already. – But say it was red for the pedestrian, and they decide to walk out anyway. Then I morally would say that the pedestrian should die over the driver, as the one in the wrong was the pedestrian. – But the issue is that the driver is never in the wrong if the car is fully automated.

The logic behind the car thing should be that it sacrifices the pedestrian because you shouldn&#39;t cross the road when a fucking car is coming anyway. Not that a person who can afford a self driving car should live as opposed to someone who has to walk everywhere, that&#39;s how it comes off when you explain it.
Omg, been so long since I&#39;ve seen Edgar. He&#39;s gotten so old :o

Hello
Who’s here after pewds took a break
When growtopia? I want to get dislikes.
It&#39;s funny how Felix say that channels with useless information are awful and shows a Tom Scott video the goes to say that he enjoyed learning how the U.K. plugs are safer from a Tom Scott video.
I had a chihuahua mixed dog (we don&#39;t exactly know what she was) and she actually was very well behaved. She never barked, always behaved whenever we took her on a trip and was child-friendly (which was the most important part to my parents). I miss her, she was the best dog in the world.
OMG THERE IS A FUCKING BUTTON IN MY FRIDGE, I HAD NEVER NOTICED
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhl9wWLv2Yo&amp;t=204">3:24</a> actually yes I can relate

Baby Yoda should be meme of the decade because this decade was a series of middling-highs and serious lows, but virtually everyone can agree that Baby Yoda is cute and brings out the best in us. It&#39;s the one thing we can all rally around, no matter our creed or faith or politics, and I think that&#39;s great.

@PewDiePie can you react to r/animememes?
What is the sauce of the anime in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhl9wWLv2Yo&amp;t=165">2:45</a> ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhl9wWLv2Yo&amp;t=740">12:20</a> our plugs are different where I am from. With that said the non EU plug looks safer because it has a 3rd prong that looks like it&#39;s meant for grounding an electrical current in case of emergency.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhl9wWLv2Yo&amp;t=680">11:20</a><br>It makes me happy to hear you care about your pets so much. ❤️ <br>A lot of people abuse their pets by overfeeding them and it’s a good thing you said something Felix. 👍🏻
You&#39;re right tho, if theres a dog (or the rare friendly cat that likes being petted) I just go straight to that and can just pet for hours and I consider that a great time. Plus obviously I&#39;m socially awkward and pets are great.
Moving his PP in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhl9wWLv2Yo&amp;t=190">3:10</a>, PERFECT

Count how many times does PewDiePIE said ok?
It&#39;s kinda scary seeing Edgar with grey muzzle, cause I remember him when pewds  first got him as puppy it seems like yesterday. So much time has passed.
