I&#39;d love too hear Elon conduct himself and be that eloquent in Mandarin.. It would be easier to engage the crowd when you speak your mother language
PewDiePie Nice
space sucks
Alcoholism
Elon talking to the alibaba guy is hilarious😭

bro didn&#39;t realize he was eating the packaging cause that&#39;s just how dogass british food is
pewds not caring about earth and wants to live in other planets CONFIRMED

Are you with Tara.?
That wasn’t gta V it was czech game mafia 3 and it’s really bad and repeptive the priveous games are gold litearly the best czech game ever if u don’t count beat saber.
holy shit rewatching this on accident and i can acctualy drunk if i laugh, ive lived long enough to become the gloria
Musk is just a clown in disguise
i love how he just gave no fs, the pewds i know and love,not grown enough? grow up to watch this theeen

It’s not a bad sign 😂😂 I got JESUS and mother marry hanging up on a walkin my hosue bath doing the same sign , it means what he said , high and low , it’s not if the devil lmaoo
This wasn’t a try not to laugh.  It should have been called Felix simps for Elon and drinks whiskey for 5 minutes.
&quot;I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not poor&quot; lol
It&#39;s funny when you realize that alcohol generally makes you more lighthearted and able to laugh more. Basically, as soon as he laughs like 3 times, he&#39;s screwed.
I wonder how pew feels about elon now?
Seeing Jerma in a Pewds video, for whatever reason is super trippy
Elons cars have no personality. Cars for a while now have no personality. No soul and love put into design unlike back in the day. Same with cameras. They used to be hand made beautifully crafted. Now you get plastic cheap throw away ones. Plain looking cameras. Sad really
That mum is really annoying. He son definitely has mental health issues having a mouthy mother like that.

Pewds: Statisticly speaking the earth is 40 000 years overdue of getting hit by a devastating asteroid so not looking at other stars and the universe is very irresponsible.<br><br>Pewds 2 min before: 80% of statistics are wrong<br><br>Not hate just think its kinda funny (especially because he called Jack Ma out for the same thing kinda^^)

Remember people that Felix did have an alcohol addiction well not an alcohol addiction per se, but an whiskey addiction. Japanese whiskey to be exact.

I think the Matthew McConaughey post was fine. It&#39;s dad humor, sure. Trying to come up with a one-liner or metaphor for everything, but it&#39;s fun! Making up new ways to express hat you want to say makes you more flexible, I think it&#39;s not worth being scornful over. His message was that &quot;I wantto see how people react to the things I wanna share, if they don&#39;t like it, that&#39;s cool too&quot; and that makes sense to me.
Qhh i see, you watch you drink?
What kind of whiskey he drinken give us the sauce
This is what i needed drinking by myself at 1 am 😫
how knew this guy was in deep pain at this moment
I miss the time when he was watching the YLYL threads in 4chan.

I had to click off this video out of respect for my people
Pewds: * doesn&#39;t even try not to laugh *<br>Me: I guess he really was addicted...
This video has a different meaning knowing what we know today

The Alibaba guy is nauseating.
ii my kid acted like that i would take awat console
Of course Jack Ma is interested in Earth and not elsewhere because in a few decades from now China will own it all. They don&#39;t want people to do their stuff elsewhere, they want them to do it next door so they can swoop in and take it.
I am 5&quot;2 and I couldn&#39;t care or less. It has never stopped me from succeeding at anything........ except reaching the top shelf in the supermarket.

PewDiePie&#39;s IQ points 1,300 billion my IQ points 3
6 Aug 2021
The ali baba guy made some good points though.<br><br>He wasn&#39;t siting a statistic he was saying that of predictions made, several of them have not come true. Which in itself wasn&#39;t a prediction, either.<br><br>Also he said creating AI is a look into ourselves as people, which is true. What makes up a human, why is human decision making different from animals or machines, why do we want to be good even in (some cases) the absence of a God? What does an AI do that makes it similar or different from a human?<br><br>Maybe he isn&#39;t as smart as Elon Musk, but that doesn&#39;t mean Elon can be a jerk and disregard what he says just to embarrass him.<br>He can&#39;t articulate what he wants to say as well, but that doesn&#39;t make his ideas or words less valid.
The chinese dude was so small like wtf.
THAT WAS NOT GTA 5! fuck me I cant remember the game. Someone help me out here.
Jack Ma has become his fake persona. He is a broken dude. So out of touch with everything he&#39;s like an NPC. I feel that listening to him talk must be like what non English speakers hear. A bunch of words that you recognize as English but don&#39;t make any sense.
if your just a dumb kid and want to participate in the drinking just get a bottle of W if you know what i mean<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>water.

Talking about going to Mars while the planet is in the state that it&#39;s in, is kind of like talking about going to Disneyland while your house is on fire. Put out the fire first, then we can talk about the trip to Disneyland Felix. Grow the hell up.

Lmao
To be fair, Jack Ma has kind of a point with Mars. Some tiny sliver of a point. Once we are able to somewhat easily get to Mars, there is no turning around for a lot of people. We’ve seen technology that was modern less than 20 years ago get rendered nearly obsolete by today’s standards, so I wouldn’t be surprised if, someday in the not-so-distant-future, colonizing other celestial bodies will be the new “norm”.
Elon is so precious i want to hug him lol
I&#39;ve seen the jack ma vid before this. Man he&#39;s so annoying.

Unpopular opinion, but I think a lot of Elon Musk&#39;s ideas are just ideas, and too farfetched to actually play out in reality. I think it&#39;s amazing how he&#39;s pushed the ideas of environmentally friendly and luxury together, and the idea of space technology being privatized, but there&#39;s still a lot of stuff he pitches out, that is farfetched, and in some cases haven&#39;t really played out. Like the Hyperloop or the thing that was supposed to take cars underground and move them faster than they could drive, to avoid traffic. It&#39;s also amazing how someone as young as him could create a multi billion dollar company in so little time.
Me and Alexa are alike strokes

If I ever see Felix in public and he’s shorter than me, I’m literally gonna try and pick him up and lift him over my shoulders.
hello  my  is    serbia
I just did not like how pewdiepie insulted Matthew mcconaughey. The guy is a legend.
Have you heard of Jack ma story
Calling Matthew McConaughey a random dude is kinda weird. Felix, know your culture.
I got Drunk off of this video!!! Dammit, worth it
Were due for a mega volcano which there are 3 spots for mega volcanos in the us alone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=318">5:18</a> i am pretty sure that’s racism

Getting way to high and staring at my poop in the toilet for 36 minutes led me here

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=683">11:23</a> <br><br>Matthew McConaughey: &quot;You got to have the dialogue to have the monologue just as you have to have a monologue to have the dialogue&quot;<br>Also Mathew McConaughey: writes presidential election speeches 2020.
elon &quot;help     me&quot;
Stop fan girling  for Elon

Who else Alexa turned on
Felix bringing up my worst fear of that overdue meteor hitting earth shot up my anxiety instantly 😂
Felix has a soft spot for elon
i love how cool elon musk is
Pewdiepie would leave marzia for Elon in a SECOND
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=340">5:40</a> <br>This is a personal reminder for myself... Just ignore this comment
You can tell Elon is so much smarter than that guy
This is first time when you want to laugh
Lmafo jack mahhhhhhhh
Immmmmm not five tow WTF IM lower <b>illumination meme sound</b>
Mmmhh, I might have to disagree with pewds on the matter &quot;we can do both&quot;, as in &quot;explore beyond earth and solve recent problems at the same time&quot;.<br><br>I think that it depends on how serious matters on earth are. Pollution, world hunger, wars...etc... have been going on for years - decades- and we still are not getting better. <br><br>I think those are very serious problems. <br>Investing money and effort into &quot;exploring beyond the horizon&quot; isn&#39;t wise at this point.<br><br>Sure...humans are curious and knowledge-hungry beasts, but we should know better.<br><br>The reason why we can&#39;t do both at the same time is (like always) money. <br><br>At least that&#39;s my opinion... <b>*SHRUGS*</b>
Grandma is ExaX confirmed
Mafia III = Gta
Really jealous of that Japanese whisky
Plot twist he is in fact bei g set up by Obama
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=357">5:57</a> they should have added Mike Hunt
taketsuru is the real shit
Jack Ma got rich from copying Jeff Bezos like all Chinese knockoffs Alibaba is no exeption its cheaper and shitier version of the orignial
GOT THAT GOOD WHISKEY
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=766">12:46</a> But isn&#39;t 80% of statistics incorrect???
jackma vs elon musk is just 2 noobs making conversation for a bunch of noobs
I think this one is YLYD not YLYL
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Pewdiepie just seem out his nut in this
&quot;80% of predictions are all wrong&quot;<br>Simpsons:Im bout to end this mans whole career

I’ve had to listen to so much drama teacher that what Matthew maccoghnahey was saying is actually making sense.
Dear, Pewdiepie, you shouldn&#39;t drink alcohol its degeneracy/communism
I love that they were actually trying to help the guy eating the burrito packaging lol
Jesus, the kid that won’t go and shit in the bathroom 🤢🤢🤢🤮
ALIBABA INTELLIGENCE?<br>INTELLIGENCE??????!?!?

Hello
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=400">6:40</a> This isnt Gta 5 its Mafia 3
&quot;I&#39;m being framed by the president of Barrak Obama&quot;
first dont believe all meteor talk its mostly to make it feel like life doesnt matter. Second we would already be on mars if we had fixed all stupid problems on earth instead of concentrating on otherworldly things. Start with urself then the rest will fix itself
E
Thanks Pewdiepie i watched this video to get drunk easier and i got even more sober by not drinking a single shot ._.
No we are 40k years overdue the supervolcano yellowstone in the us
The gfuel is fantastic.  I never thought that Jojo PewDiePie would look so cool
The owner of Alibaba feels like a nice guy. I dont like Elon’s responses. Its classical thing that westerners do. He laughs and makes jokes in the middle of his sentences and uses the fact that this is his native lenguage and that he chinese guy doesnt speak that well. The chinese guy makes a great point, Millions starve to death and a guy wants to take picutres on Mars. That is just wrong.
When PewDiePie started meowing, my kitten came running into the room and started staring at me.i swear😂 Damn he must be a cat. So funny.
That&#39;s not gta you uncultured swine
Pewdiepie: “ <b>Youre just speaking gibberish and pretending to be smart</b> ”<br>Also Pewdiepie: * Proceeds to talk about space *

Fact  you

The year is 2027: Elon Musk buys the European Union and now memes are allowed again, meanwhile Trump reveals he is a transhuman and Kim Jong Un&#39;s surgeon was his robot.
Just to add on to pewdiepies overdue meteor, we’re also overdue on Yellowstones eruption
Leave my boy Matthew McConaughey alone!
Th chinese man is very smart and really tryhing his best so why you gotta hate on that? You just see he has it difficult
You laughg you drink<br>Felix: I see this as an absolute win
Low key thought he was drinking somethingout from his flesh light in the cover
Plot twist: he laughed purposely to drink more
why does the dog on the left at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=304">5:04</a> have  eyebrows?

Omfg! My bf once told me about this dude he saw while he was at the Seattle central library who very blatantly got down on his knees and crawled under the table some asian chicks were sitting at and proceeded to sniff their feet. And aparently the dude seemed very chipper and pleased with himself. I wonder if it was the same dude from this video on the news.

What kind of whiskey glass is he drinking from? I can&#39;t find them online.
Wish I could drink expensive whiskey like you lol Johnny Walker is pretty good though. You earned it bro keep up the amazing work.
Pewdiepie laughing on purpose just so he can drink.

PewDiePie is a noob don&#39;t subscribe him subscribe to t- series
Pretty sure your statistic about the meteor is actually us being overdue a yellow stone super volcano eruption
It&#39;s weird how I was wondering when this was from and I could immediately date it when he mentioned baby yoda... meme calendar is real...
Wow
F
That was a great floof!

Pewds: sees funny clip<br>Also Pewds: it’s definitely fake
The talk between Elon and the Alibaba guy are just painful to watch.
&#39;Pewds workout routine&#39;
Wow, isnt that the guy that died to pinwheel on stream?!?!
Whenever people complain about space travel,  I always remember the &quot;space brothers&quot;
Pewds is the Elon/Tony stark of yt

“ you have to have a dialogue to have a monologue and uh you have to have a monologue to have a dialogue “
Matthew McConaughey is a troll though. False depth is like his thing.
When he mention &quot;forbidden burrito&quot; I thought it was Papa Franku&#39;s recipe
Yo that “I do that” was a perfect imitation. That’s incredible😂
Marzia should be in this video
F
Video: Not funny<br>Pewds: laughs anyways as an excuse to drink🤣🤣🤣
To be fair to Jeff ma though, he is speaking a foreign language, let’s see you people do an interview in Chinese

When the girl said “Alexa Simon says hahahahahhaha” my Alexa did the same thing I thought someone else was in my room or something
Elon: including this one<br>Chineese man (don&#39;t know his name): NANI!??!
Elon always cracks me up
What do you expect from the Communist guy. The guy is obviously in his own bubbles.
Jag gjorde inte en låt, och din är ändå perfekt. Älskar fortfarande dig pewds

Matthew mcconway was speaking about the ego and perception, in a conversation (dialogue), there is also a monologue (Thoughts) that not everyone is aware of, which also can become emotions<br>&quot;Let&#39;s keep the high eye not the low eye ( could be capital &quot;I&quot;), he means third eye.
Did he call mafia 3 gta 5

When someone doesn&#39;t wanna get up from playing a game that they can stop at any time even though they are shitting themselves, that&#39;s when it has gone to far and they have a serious addiction.

Lol i used to say a bunch a nonsense to seem smarter too. but that was when i was 8.
A meteor hasn’t hit us yet, because the moon is earth’s meat shield
why is elon musk wearing space boots under that suit tho XD
god he ruins every clip, why talk before the punchline. im done watching these
Love how PewDiePie bullies the guy that is short but he can’t even stand ip
that&#39;s mafia 3 not gta 5
This is literally just a video of Pewdiepie running out of content but also wanting to get drunk 😂<br><br><br>[ 9 year olds don&#39;t come after me lol ]
When I first saw the thumbnail I thought you were drinking from a pocket p**sy
I know this video came out last year, but I just watched and pewds gas just butchered the halo theme song. I have never been so offended
Amazon for Chinese products = Amazon
well i don&#39;t need to worry about that meteorite anymore because 80% of statistics are wrong
I was just staring at Elon musks face the whole time he looks like he is done with life 😂
Thats Mafia 3 lmao
I know this video is older now and it might have been said already but, the kid who shit himself could have a mental disability. My bro is on the spectrum and when he was younger he would shit himself playing games.
That&#39;s Mafia 3 DumbAss
Wtf, Grandma said &quot;cum&quot;? 🤣🤣
I&#39;m sorry but his face is just too damn small for his head. He looks like a watcher or something, megamind but with a normal sized head just a really small face.
theres alotta viamins in plastic ye
holy crap how drunk is he
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=784">13:04</a> I’m gonna assume you meant condemnable but it’s okay Pewds, I’m not bilingual so I can’t say shite.

its not gta 5 its mafia 3
youre an elon simp. does he do stuff w marzia?
Look up Jerma985, the guy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=18">0:18</a> . He does a tonne of comedic content, he usually just live streams, he even did a livestream where he let the chat manually control (through chat commands) robots, in order to play some IRL carnival games. Chat shoots him in the face!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=682">11:22</a> <br>This is known as a colossal waffler

&quot;Overdue&quot; is more or less meaningless. Statistically
The &quot;burrito&quot; video sent me on a Google hunt to learn about styrofoam and polystyrene. The guy will likely be fine unless it causes a blockage, as it is likely not harmful, but is indigestible. Styrofoam can produce toxic chemicals when in contact with acid; however, most takeaway containers are polystyrene.
Thought it was a frickin fleshlight in the thumbnail
😂😂

You are drunk
Why is it that anyone like Elon that is interested in space travel or creating living on multi planets. ALL THE SUDDEN they ALSO have to deal with all the other problems in the world. Like why? Isn&#39;t there someone else thats interested in cleaning up the oceans? Leave it to them for fucks sake.
you know the ali baba dude came from nothing and now he is the richest person in china
I love how Elon says 80% of statistics are not true but pewdiepie is talking about statistics

that guy probably watched some tedtalks and rehearsed what he heard in the mirror. Its so clear that he&#39;s not there to talk to elon but just recite his script.

He laughs as often as possible to drink as often as possible
I would totally just watch Felix watching YouTube videos

you know,chinese people just can&#39;t help being over serious or producing bullshit in occasions like this, something is wrong with us, it&#39;s like,there&#39;s no way out

Space isn’t real bro you can’t have a pressurized system next to a vacuum without a container
poor jerma
Holy shit it&#39;s a compact streamer
Almost everything in the world is a Chinese product
Any video that starts with a Jerma clip is good in my book.
&quot;its like Amazon but for Chinese products basically&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>So, Amazon.</b>
Alchohol jokes just bcz he had a few sips GREAT
i dont think jack ma is trying to sound smart by saying all that... i think hes actually very intelligent except he cant put his words together right since english is not his language...... the mans trying his best
I feel like Elon copied apple when the glass broke, he had it weakened on purpose to get people to talk about it, like when Apple had the facial recognition that didn&#39;t work. Otherwise the truck would have just been a weird looking  electric truck.
We are closing in on a week after pewdiepie quit. I know it will take me years to watch all his videos that i havent watched, but he will still be missed.
&quot;the ability to speak dosent mean you are smart&quot;
A water balloon
Cant believe I subbed to u before u had a mil now u have 102 crazy
Saying that Alibaba is like the Chinese amazon is funny to hear when u know that 35% of their (amazons) stock is actually coming from china and re-selled alibaba/aliexpress products just with higher prices.
This went from You laugh You lose to let&#39;s talk about how boring and annoying this Chinese guy is 😂😂😂
I appreciate the way he laughed after saying I’m so glad I’m not poor considering how he kind of used to be😂😂
We just 9

Damn he is the maker of alibaba 🤔
elon is a living legend

Was confused for a moment there, though I was watching an upload by Jerma
Had no idea Jack Ma was that annoying.
McConaughey sounds like hes doing a bad Bill Clinton impression
Бред какой то!
Hey pewds, are you ok? You started drinking again? I thought you stoped
PewDiePie: <b>exists calmly</b><br>Pewds: &quot;drinks a bit&quot;<br>PewDiePie : &quot;So, let&#39;s talk about Elon&quot;
Jack ma just sucks
OMG THAT GUY WHO SAID OT WAS BECAUSE OF BARAC OBAMA THAT HAPPENED IN MY TOWN LMAO I FLUND THAT SO FUNNY
You’re not too bright you’re self pewds he said statistics not predictions dude, basic ass English.  And you’re making fun of other people’s intelligence? And how dare you compare him to Matthew! Lol jeez
Lonely Swedish man locked in bedroom drinks alcohol every time he laughs while looking at memes
Jerma isn’t short, he’s compact.
It is true, humans know more about space than they know about earth
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=103">1:43</a> lol
This Chinese guy is a typical Chinese boomer XD
I like how Felix tells people to stfu because they&#39;re dumb, but he is probably the dumbest guy on youtube. People listen to him because he has a lot of subscribers

That tangent killed the vibe of the vid big time
that was mafia3
Your tangent sucked. Still luv u tho, bruh

“Im not interested in mars earth is more important”<br><br><br>We need to search mars to see if we could possibly survive there when the world gets to bad to survive
God jack ma is a pompous prick
It freaks me the hell out when Pewds just gets serious and starts making some really good points. The guy is way smarter than he lets on sometimes.
Everyone calls me &quot;Epic&quot; on PSN and Twitch as my username is &quot;*****epicplayer&quot;. lol, so when he randomly says &quot;epic&quot; I feel it in my soul.
GTA 5 = Mafia 3

Felix: it’s like amazon for Chinese products <br>Me: isn’t that already what amazon is?
True dum kid
the cute cat at the end is Thurston Waffles &lt;3
Glad someone found Jack Ma to be annoyingly naive and obtuse in that AI debate.
I&#39;m <i>way</i> too happy that the first clip was Jerma.
That puffer fish meme really messed me up
ha 69 ylyl nice
This is the 69th episode of ylyl<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>n i c e</b>

Pewds when he realized he has 69 videos on ylyl:<br><br>👁👄👁

I LOVE JERMA! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=20">0:20</a> watch “worst military game ever!” by him! it brought me to tears
Watched a documentary on jack ma - did u know lots of Chinese millionaires be mysteriously disappearing outta nowhere? jack Ma is the Chinese fav boi bc he keeps to the regimes dumb ass logic and doesn’t criticize that’s why he just talks a bunch of nonsense shit to keep people’s brains senseless and uncritical. He basically became what the regime made of him. I mean people becoming rich and capitalism is kinda the opposite of communism but hey... They literally feed the masses with dumbo entertainment to keep them busy from beim critical to the regime. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Elon musk is the best
clips r too quiet
This was the 69th ylyl
👌👍
👌👍
I found out he has a very low alcohol tolerance
I thought the thumbnail was him tasting a dripping pocket pus-
dont watch his on molly
Plz make more of these also, I love the post meme input
Love jerma
.
I have a lot of videos to watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=735">12:15</a>lool

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=845">14:05</a> the &quot;hp&quot; logo looks kinda like a lightning bolt, and it says &quot;hp&quot;...<br><br><br>Harry is that you?
&quot;I hope this tickles your funny bone&quot;<br><br>The funny bone is painful.<br><br>As is listening to you speak.
103 MILLIONS SUBS
Pewds: “we are LITERALLY overdue for a meteor to hit our planet by 40,000 years STATISTICALLY”<br><br>I thought you said 80% of statistics aren’t correct...
My cousin is doing this challenge with me...he&#39;s 14....let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t laugh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=356">5:56</a> He was 100% in on it because he was one of my teachers in high school last year
Can anyone tell the name of video of ping pong ball
Anything rich boi says Elon is just like &quot;myeah but no&quot;
So many subs REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Pewdiepie grow a beard.
Alibaba is a company that supplies sellers like, when people buy 1000 cups and then sell them on amazon, it can also deliver to USA.
&quot;This is how Marzia feeds me&quot;<br>I&#39;m dead 💀 but I still have to drink
Judge: I&#39;m out <br>Felix: <b>laughing intensifies</b> <br>Me: 🤦‍♀️
PewDiePie: &quot;I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not poor&quot; <br>Media: Write that down! Write that down!
jack ma is the real boomer
Elon should ban Alibaba shipments when he completed colonizing Mars.
My username in Roblox is johbac
<b>Oooff</b>
Bit late to the video but I would like to say one thing it was mafia 3  not GTA 5
“this is how marzia feeds me” was so unexpected i can’t LOL
F for the short guy

Mood intensifies*<br>Pewdiepie- &quot;I think I&#39;m gonna end it there&quot;. Perfect timing.

This channel sucks. Like how does he have more that 100mill subscribers?
Haha I funny I call Felix alcoholic I am Mr humor haha!!!

Pewds: well im not poor<br><br>Robber: hold my knife

Jerma in a Pewdiepie video, my life is complete
Dude that clip with Elon and Asian ass hat is hilarious, why haven&#39;t I seen it until now.
i
I was drinking vitamin water while watching this 👀
I had a stroke I’m not offended just proud
why does pewdiepie look up to elon musk so much? i’m kinda curious
NINCH
Will you be my dad
Ahaha I actually did this at the same time <br>With hennessy <br>I&#39;m 15 tho
God. I am so... sober by now

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=883">14:43</a> this is how pewdiepie defeats coppa
How pewds defeat coppa:<br>drinking &quot;slurp juice&quot; in a video
I could actually imagine Felix buying cats just to teach then the Halo theme song😂
Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=105">1:45</a> in the corner
Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=105">1:45</a>
McConaughey is one of those dumb people who think they&#39;re geniuses

FALUKORV
Jack ma(chinese dude):0.01% of human prediction is true because of accident<br><br>Master Oogway(chinese turtle):there are no accidents
F for short guy
&quot;youtube demonetized me!&quot; internet:ahah
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=433">7:13</a> my man laughed so hard he spewed his drink all over the carpet
Pewdiepie hates people speaking gibberish because its bad bad that goes bad epic
F&#39;s in the chat for people that claim the China video is racist.<br>Sorry you&#39;re brainwashed!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=476">7:56</a> wtf
not to be a mood killer but i feel like you got a lot of impressionable young kids who watch you i kinda feel iffy about this
I&#39;m 5.3 :(
Elon video. No. Stop. Get some help.
Damn that’s good that’s facts
*pops out the whiskey<br>here we go again
He was sweating to bad you could see the reflection of his monitor on his forehead :D
Real cool Felix but he wasn&#39;t playing gta
Aww tiny guy is adorable!
When someone thinks Mafia 3 is GTA 5
F
5 feet was the human average
I love how Elon wants to die while talking to the Alibaba dude.
I just realized his shaker looks exactly like a pocket-pussy in the thumbnail O.o
I like how he&#39;s drinking but still says frick instead of fuck
5 minute crafts AND drinking? Sounds like Cody kolidgreszaszyjkasfhhsaafh
My Alexa started going ha haha haha behind me that’s the fastest I’ve ever ran

RIP JUICE WRLD
Thank you for this, I’m really hydrated rn
I think that bathroom kid have very serious depression
<b>Haha</b>
I legit skipped the jack ma part
Jack Ma: &quot;I don&#39;t care about Mars, I care about Earth&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Also Jack Ma: *Doesn&#39;t donate to Teamtrees
Well that&#39;s not true at all. Yes, the Chinese guy has a problem with eloquence because of mediocre english skills and bad habit of making up numbers.<br>But, he&#39;s point about perfecting yourself rather than being dependent on technology is true. Technology is covering up needle holes, while ignoring the main problem - human attitude towards ecology\another human\ animal etc. Elon-sama is false prophet. REPENT!
Laugh = drink <br><br><br>Comment = like<br># = bracko Obama
Pewds sounds smart when he&#39;s drunk
Drank with you pewdiepie!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=237">3:57</a> she run out of breath😂😂😂
The stuff mcconaughey said made sense tho. “You gotta have dialogue to have a monologue” Talking with other people helps clarify the ideas and thoughts you have that may not have been fleshed out.
wtf pewds
I also thought the thumbnail meant he was drinking GFuel but I guess it was alcohol. What a troll move!
Jack Ma kinda sounds like one of those entitled billionaires I mean &quot;I&#39;d wait for an elevator if I was going to the Himalayas&quot;? Props to Elon for holding that conversation up.
The cats are photoshopped one of the cats tails are going through the edge of the walkway into the basement
It’s element not elevator. It’s ok tho. Still love you.
I remember when I was like twelve, pewdiepie just started and everyone thought his videos were too crass with language. Now some people say it’s kid friendly😂😂 it shows how values have changed over the years
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWzg_NveE&amp;t=137">2:17</a> my ears🙁
Terraria men
OMG JERMA XD
♥️♥️
yet yo
Wait is stealing plastic bags are legal or illegal
Felix: it&#39;s basically Lazada for chinese products<br>Me: what&#39;s the difference
Duuuuuuuuude, jerma &lt;3
Gets banned in America
Jack Ma is really, <b>really</b> good at saying absolutely nothing for the longest period of time, in fact I think he belongs in Guinness Book of World Records
Is going to Mars based off of a statistic?
i can hardly hear the vid itself pewds is so loud
Augh
F
