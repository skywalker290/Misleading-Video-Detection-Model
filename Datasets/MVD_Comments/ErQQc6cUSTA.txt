The specs of the pc are funny to me, so weak.
Do you still have this Big O?<br><br>If so would you be interested in selling it?  I’m a collector of older  and unique tech  products
This is the only entanglement I&#39;m interested in having in my life
Now build one with Xbox pro PlayStation 5 wii switch game cube with PC option also VR mode and let me have it lol
Ok class what comes before 47?<br><br><br><br>Quiet kid: ak
Trying to build one myself
Did you have to personally order pc with all 3 systems in one pc, or do they only build 3 game system (which version is PS4, Xbox360, PC or 4 game system (Big O v.3)? When you go to the site, they only advertising: parts, specs, towers….etc how’d you get them to build you the Big O with gaming systems together?
is this another one off?
Can&#39;t even get it
WOW
how much would this cost
Can I change the PC parts &#39;and the models of switch ,Xbox and ps
How does it compair (pricewise) to  buying etch console individually?
who&#39;s here after watching the vid of the v3
That thing probaly generates a shit ton of heat... at least you&#39;ll be good for the winter.
I would sell my soul for this. Of course with PS5 and Xbox one on the board
How much
I saved my money
momma mia!....thats a spicy meatball!
that storage is enough for about 4 more cod updates
this is retarded. none of those systems need to be water cooled. you cant overclock them. they are all quiet already. this makes no fucking sense. i love how he tries to do mental gymnastics in order to try and make sense of this cluster fuck of a contraption.
Imagine knocking the table over 💸💸💸💸

Shoulda called it all for one
someone did a breakdown of all of its components, and estimated it at around $28,000 - $34,000. this includes parts, and the manual labor to assemble it
Me on a <br>Separate ps5<br>Separate ps4<br>Separate one x<br>Separate 3080 pc <br>Also me: ha ha
The Nintendo Switch should have been watercooled. This is a cop out.
I&#39;m back here to ask you to do with Series X, PS5, Switch and a PC, or just wait a little while for a maybe the pre-release of Switch Pro, PS5 &quot;PRO&quot; and Series X Pro.
you are not worthy no of my genius lame
Well, now I just have to sell my house...
As much as I have to admit this is an awesome idea, as a member of the PC master race I can&#39;t help but feel this is an absolute abomination lmao
waiting for someone to think of combining pc and ps4 in 1
Something for Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo players
How much
If it doesnt play the discs and cartridges, its not really worth it
The ultimate question is. But can it run minecraft?
Outdated no 3090 or ps5
Wait you missed the opportunity when you said we ready for on the go we got the Yoshi.....you didn&#39;t say Yoshi on the Goshi for that you lose

Me want badly 🥺🥺🥺🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤but now PS5, switch, PS3 why COD BLACK OPS 2 MULTI-PLAYER AND ZOMBIES UNLESS IT GETS REMASTERED. not a Xbox fan.
That is absolutely insane
We all noticed that the heat from one CPU is just being transferred to the next, right?...
I could never own this because I would get robbed where I live.
6th gen console gamers would&#39;ve dreamed of a ps2, gamecube, xbox, and 2000&#39;s potato pc in one back in 2005.
I want these so bad
UT still plays OW?! LETS GOOOOOOOOO
I bet whoever got this is mad that new gen is out 😂
@10;:04 what kind of doggo is that???
They should make another one and call it &quot;The big O 2.O&quot; With the Ps5 Xbox Series X and the Switch Oled. 🤣
,Para cuando la actualización?.
I hope they do it for the very good PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch and the Xbox series X
The PC 2
now that I look at it, they just needed a ps4 in there. game pass does the same thing a xbox does
Where do I get this tho
@Unbox Therapy no switch gameplay, so i dont believe there is a switch over there.
You call that a knife? This is a knife 🔪
Hello can purchasing one of those units be used to start an Arcade business?

,,Time to unleash the beast.&quot;<br>- every Big O owner when they&#39;re about to fire up the whole system
What about the gaming consoles that we did not know
cant find the big o
Imagine a mid 2000s version of this that&#39;s an original Xbox, PS2, and Nintendo Gamecube, all connected to a Core2Duo PC with windows Vista, 512MB graphics card, 2 gigabytes of DDR2 ram, and a 250GB mechanical hard drive.
If you&#39;re rich af, no problem you got the kind of money for this. If you&#39;re not, which kidney do you want to sell?
can you make upgrades to the pc?
That&#39;s a awesome idea wish they could do more customized for like find a PS3 playback model an other vintage style consoles an build them into a case where there safe an sound for the future
Your guys are geniuses !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just saved all my money to buy this fuckkk the ps5 is out this is old
What about the power usage
Loved that Opus Eponymous shirt aswell.
This is just incredible
I remember eating I think pancakes while eating this
according to my knowledge, that ps4 pro will break soon. (after being used for a while)
Sad, the origin doesn&#39;t sell this version
All boys want this but no boys need this
Bro where can I get this beast of a pc/console
Now do the new consoles
I want one how do I get one?
How much did this cost?
WOW!!!!
This one is for millionaires
in the thumbnail it looks like its about to fall on him
Can I buy this ?<br>O mamá yes you can
&quot;*yes*&quot;
It doesn&#39;t include the KFConsole, I&#39;m not into it.
lol
Group of friends: So u tryna do lan coop? Kinda sucks cus itl be split screen but oh well.<br><br>Kid who owns the big o: about that......
That’s not every console jackass
When you can&#39;t decide what console you want:
PRICE PLEASE
Is this legal?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErQQc6cUSTA&amp;t=95">1:35</a> he turns into a Black teenager
Can&#39;t wait for big O 2 with ps5, XBOX Series X and switch OLED model.
Eu to vendo isso e chorando por dentro por pensar quantos rins vou ter que vender pra ter 1 desses sjsjsjsjs
Wife replacement
What is it with the music, It’s frickin weird
hey i want buy this Device <br>tell me how and I searched this site, but I couldn&#39;t find it
when next gen ? ps5 , xbox series x and more
yes mom i need this for online classes
I&#39;m still savin for my first PS5 😶
This just looks like waste of energy to be honest...
이미 있었구나?
… I can only imagine what the 2.0 version’s price would be with ps5 and Xbox series x motherboards.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
what kind of witchcraft is this man <br>kid: what console do you play on <br>you :&quot;everything&quot;
The xbox is pretty useless there since you could use a pc to play the same things but the ps4 or ps5 is understandable because of the games limited to it
Friend : what console you play on<br>Rich kid : yes
Why not wiiu
This is incredibly stupid..... Why would you combine all 3 systems to be powered at the same time? If my ps4 dies, I want to my my Xbox and visa versa. This has no redundancy and his power bill probably jumped $10 just for an hour of playtime.
I have more powerful pc a different ps4 pro and a xbox as well hehehehhe .. rtx 3090
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErQQc6cUSTA&amp;t=198">3:18</a>
Or....you could have a massive desk...4 consoles and monitors all lined up next to each other....boom ...SAME THING....! PROBABLY LESS WIRES TOO
2.5 k yeaaaahh
For those doingbmemes thinking u can get it ia just a demo of what they can do in pcs not for buy and those who just make memes knowing that are ok
amazing the evey compnent get old in 2 years. pc xbox ps in build all become low end. only switch part useful this machine now wtf.
Video
Awesome
how much does this thing cost
oops, i dropped it
This is insane
$2500 to start
Shi with how much storage a lot of the games take especially the ones towards the end of the Xbox and PS4 lifetime a part of me doesn&#39;t think 14 tb is enough 😂
<b><i>They should build a ps5 and a series x and switch in one pc case</i></b>
will it ever come back in stock is my question
I have to sell my kidney to get this
Me watching this and want it so bad<br>Me thinking want organ should i sell
Give me one
I want this, we All want this
so happy w mine definitely would recommend to anyone considering it
Sucks that just a few months later it&#39;s already out of date
Jesus Christ is the King don’t use The Lord’s name in vain.
Dam the XBOX and PS4 PCB&#39;s so ugly looking!! In 2021 I wonder how much this &#39;system&#39; would be worth (consider the pandemic and silicon shortage right now).
I call it the one box 360 one x
The big o.. the price. Big dough.
I would by this if it was a combination of PS3, PS4 and PS5
ou est le plaisir de jouer simplement
Try this for new gen consoles
this is what we call fake news
Wow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErQQc6cUSTA&amp;t=290">4:50</a> <br>sings: i need a dollar.
bad!
great video. do you think they will do a BOG O 2.0 to PS5 AND XBOX SERIES X
I think only I have useless ideas but I don&#39;t know origin also have useless ideas
The noise after he put the nintendo switch in made me jump lmao!😅🤣
I&#39;d say it&#39;s a great idea but it would cost too much money for the ones that can&#39;t afford it so I guess we all have to stay with it being split like it is I have Xbox PlayStation Nintendo I have a lot of them did have weed but I sold it it had PlayStation one gave it to my grandson did have
3k graphics card yup that&#39;s my entire budget
what is the price of this I kinda want it
Yes mom, it’s for school.
i wish for one of this 😭

@a2d
Are they making a next gen one?
who the fuck needs 14 fucking TB of storage
What about PC can I use it like a normal PC or is only just for games ?
they should update the model
They have to do the same with ps5 and series x
You know its tuff shit when you have to unscrew the box
Bro they need to upgrade lol and wait as well for the new switch
Now they just gotta remake it with the xbox series x, ps5, and 3090
wouldn&#39;t it suck if all his friends were mobile gamers
Say no more.<br><br><br><br>I need that.
i Think You Should Name it &quot;PlayBox&quot; That will be cool 😂😂😂😂
Who needs kidneys or a heart when you’ve got this.
Not on the ps5
the big O upgrade coming soon?
I wish I have this one day
What a waste of money
All i need is ps5, series x and pc2 in 1 box.
“What console or pc do you want?”<br>“Yes”
My dream setup
This, this is true power.
Ima go buy this
The xbox is useless it would be better to have Pc, Ps4 and Nintendo
Nobody talks about how cool the knife that he used to open the box is
Just bought 2 of these for my twin brother&#39;s, They&#39;re reaction was priceless
“Every console in one box” literally only PlayStation and Xbox because your one of those guys no one likes
Very good  !!
I want one 😍
You can only imagine what there going to do with the new consoles systems
Price: Inf
I have ps,xbox and Nintendo thanks but I don&#39;t have my kidney no thanks <br>🤑🤑🤑🤑
Wait. That&#39;s illegal
But what if there an tutorial of how to build it without putting this computer on sale <br>I said not on sale

What&#39;s the point of having an Xbox when you also have a gaming PC?

&quot;Now witness the power of this fully armed and operational battle station!&quot;
Is their a way they can use your PS4, Xbox and switch to built the BIG O? I&#39;m just wondering because I have kids and we have 2 of each.. I don&#39;t need 3 ps4&#39;s, xbox&#39;s and switches.. may be a dumb question but I had to ask... ty

It&#39;s $2500
My girlfriend hates it 😂
Really thought he said 2 bucks I would have cried.
that costs as much as 4 kidneys
STEEL BATALION line of contact.. it is an original x box game that was played with its very own GIANT CONTROLLER... is it possible to completely convert this game into VR.. so you can bypass the giant controller and play it entirely in VR... on your PC

Holy shiiiiiit
Can u buy these or no
Payment method: V2<br>Visa <br>MasterCard<br>Kidney<br>Ur soul
great stuff
For the price and what it’s worth not worth it especially because everything is becoming cross play so pc and ps4 and Xbox and play with each other so I say if you have the money just get the pc but I can’t afford that so I just got the ps5
Ym=1 terr baap ka you tube he?
Enjoyed the overwatch gameplay
I would hate buying one of these then having it all be outdated when the new stuff comes out

Just imagine building up a complete fortnite squad with this single box, playing 4 platforms at the same time. That would be so epic. Next gen LAN party is here, my friends.

Need a Big O 2.0 now. Ps5. Series X. Switch. And high end pc.
Everybody gangsta till water color spilled
How the h3ll? Isn&#39;t there something like copyright issues?
I see what is called Big O, so it run the code at compelxity of O(n!) where n = array of games input, right?
I can&#39;t even imagine getting one of these
This man just ended console wars

I hope they do a v2 with the series x and ps5 and a badass gaming system with a 30 series that would be cool just to see in a video. But like I would definitely want to own one.
Price?

me: i buys this because it looks good as a coffe table
I wonder how much this beast cost...
I challenge them to make the big O with the  Ps5/xbox series x instead of 4 and one
I wonder, would they do this with next-gen consoles
How?
All consoles in one<br><br><b>SHOWS PLAYING ONLY PC</b>
We need an update with ps5 and xbox x
Coming soon to raspberry pi near you
yes mom i need this for studying
But can it run crysis?

I feel like this thing would cause a lot of stress...
3k ? very lesss
Thats pretty cheap
is that thing even safe to plug in?? gonna fuck around and overload allll the circuits. This thing needs its own generator lol
Can we get an updated version of this with next gen consoles? After the supply issues sort themselves out that is.
How much is this? I want one.
2 to go please...thx ;) but i wonder where to put the gamings discs...?
We need the Big O 2 with the ps5 and new Xbox and an rtx 3090
so when you&#39;re playing on one platform... does the other 3 just run idle?
Now imagine xbox series x and ps5 and pc and switch in 1 case
What would you pick? Big O or Just separate Devices
There is a problem. Now you have to buy upgrade.
They should call it the “Ninxtendostation 4”

Its a shame it won&#39;t be consol to buy thou Juts like shere know kinda type if it where on everywhere on the market it would be massive hit
This didnt age well...
To give this pc to this moron its prob one of the biggest insults i&#39;ve ever seen in gaming, such a shame
Instead of paying 17,000 dollars just buy the new consoles and a pc which rounds up to around  3,300 dollars 500-ps5 500-xbox series x 300-nintendo switch and 2,000-gaming pc and if you want all the gear then that&#39;s about another thousand dollars so instead of paying 17,000 pay 3,300 or if you want the gear the 4,300 and it&#39;s even more next generation for cheaper also If you want it in all one box If you know how to do this I guess you could put it in like a large metal box and put switches on there to change the console you use witch could be 300 dollars so 4,600. But anyways no one could even afford that so... I put way to much thinking into this.
&quot;How much fire hazard do you want?&quot;<br>Lewis: &quot;Yes.&quot;
You know, I&#39;ll just stick with my GameCube
3k graphics card 😐
Imagine this with a series x and ps5.
Watch them make a Big O 2 with the PS5 and Series X Motherboards and a Switch Pro/2/Dane/T239 (Whatever the name ends up being, same hardware) in there.
so unsocial. lol
does somebody need an extra kidney i want to sell it

Next up: this againts my gtx 1060 thats 160$ ha ha ~ thelifetimecoach

It&#39;s definitely targeting the rich category not because of the price, because you better have your own turbine power supply or your electrical bill will go through the roof.
I wonder how many units they have sold so far.
<b>The forbidden console</b>
I’d rather have my PS5
Here&#39;s a suggestion, take the PS3 slim and put PS5 equivalent tech inside it, to make it smaller
This or <br>Ps5 or <br>Xbox x
What a Good time to put in my recommendation YouTube 👍🏾
In a era of ps5 and X box series X this will be PC 2

I never thought such beauty of technology could be conceivably build by human hands; yet this is amazing I want one hands down
Should throw a nvidia shield in there with all the emulators too. <br><br>On a serious note. How much is this thing?
Hope they make a new one now with the advancements coming up in gaming
I want to sell my soul for this masterpiece
This machine should be remade with PS5, New Xbox and a system with RTX 3090.

¿why not raffle this machine in the community of followers?, yo se que no pague this computer or i dont have your sponsors, and I know that was much work for obtain this beast for your channel.But i think how with the arrival of the PS5, Xbox series X, the rtx 3080,3090.What are you going to do with this pc? is a stupid question for this great war machine. But with the tecnology advance and your job is with all components more new, so in the future your they will have another computer better than this. Please, in the moment that don&#39;t need this computer anymore It would be good to raffle it out for us, thanks and a like for let the message get to them. greetings gamers

i realllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy wwwwwwaaaaaaanttttttttttttttttttt thatttttttttttttttttttt
website shows only getting a choice between ps4 pro or xbox one s. No switch mentioned anywhere. No xbox one x. No option for all 3 consoles. Even just customizing with ps4 pro only and moderate PC hardware, still comes to over $3000. Maxing out PC hardware options brings total price over $5000 with no periferals, no xbox, and no switch. not worth and unimpressed.
I wonder if they will do this with the new consoles.

wonder if origin will plan on doing a revision with the next gen consoles.
Biggest unboxing sir.
This is THE FUTURE
Good Morning. What is the price of this product now a day?
THE BIG O   IF YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING
When the PS5 and the Xbox Series X get released  they should remake it with those two consoles and with the Nintendo Switch
SANAOL
It would be cheaper if you bought everything seperatly
Disappointed that I can&#39;t get this.  :(
I can&#39;t find an option for both PS4 and Xbox. It just let&#39;s me choose only 1 :&#39;(
I&#39;ll wait for PS5.
Who hates ads
2*1 Tb SSD+14TB hard disk. who needs a data centre stuff on a pc🔥🤣
I don’t need one. I already have a PC and PlayStation. Okay perhaps the Nintendo Switch but no to xBox
I cant afford it RN
A cheaper way around this is to get a PC buy xbox and playstation and literally just put it all in one connection so you can switch inputs via monitor saving 4k
Now they gotta make a new one with the PS5 and Xbox Series X 😂
That thing costs $5,827.52 in Australian Dollar.
Love how he’a acting like this is a console but it’s just a really good pc with xbox and ps4 logos on it lol
you are great

Meanwhile In 2030, oh it only costs 100 bucks
Lol whos here after Xbox series x and Ps5 reveal.
What&#39;s the difference between Xbox and PC? Except the higher graphics output in PC?
if they make one with ps5/xbox x im selling my kidney and buying one :)
Only sad thing is if you buy this the new xbox and ps5 coming out this fall so oof so this will be worth next to nothing except for the switch and gaming pc inside when the xbox 1 came out the 360s were literally being given away and the ps3 was worth dirt too so...
let me get the ps5 PC XboxX version
They chose a bad time to release this with the PS5 and Xbox series X around the corner.
Imagine if it was series x and ps5
Who needs a xbox ps4 and a nintendo ifo you already have a high end pc
yes thats sick as xxxx
BIG OOOOOO!!!<br>SHHOOOOWTIME!!!
How much is this worth
Every mans dream console
Ohhhhhh I want I want i need owww I can’t buy😂😩
Never seen such a useless thing, i&#39;ll only play one thing at a time, but rather all three systems will boot up for no reason, consuming excessive power
amazing
Imagine having every console ever in it and not just the modern consles
Waste of money 💰

Do he actually keep the items for use ? Or is it only collected an put in storage?

The war of the consoles has ended

Me thinking: how expensive will the version with xbox series x and ps5 be
is this some kinda rick joke, that i am too poor to understand
I can just imagine the electric bill that month.
Hey kids can we finally stop on the meme comments - Me: Yes / Mom: can we get a ... comments are so painfully annoying. Use your brains and actually type a real sentence.<br>And for all the comments about how could never afford it.... its about double what decent modern mid range custom built gaming computer would cost... A lot less than I thought it would cost. <br>Just wait 5 years it will less than a grand :)
so excessive
The new Big O only has an option for one console and one pc... (PS4 Pro OR XB1 S, not both) and the most top of the line model costs close to 6k usd.
It’s just a useless highly priced item that no one asked for lol
I&#39;m still struggling to get a ps4 and im seeing this giant consoles combined gaming machine. Its too bad😭. I bet this machine is gonna cost thousands of dollars
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErQQc6cUSTA&amp;t=209">3:29</a><br>I actually thought the thing was gonna break when he docked the switch.
ME: WOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErQQc6cUSTA&amp;t=209">3:29</a>. ;D
Nintendo and PlayStation all you need
So, that&#39;s what NASA uses!?
I love my big 1/3 O that is PlayStation
Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Is xbox really necessary? I mean you can play halo, forza etc. on windows.
i need this nowwwwww OMG
Then. Find rassbery pi plus Windows
I just realised, money can buy happiness!!
Respect
Coolest console of all time 🙏
How can I get that one. I want the all in one.
So many fucking cords
When it lags
U have power use wisley
Controllers should also be common for all consoles.
How did you get both PS4 and Xbox One? When I go to buy it it only lets me buy one or the other
good for gamer youtubers
The big ooooh boy!
how much price?
I want one for my PS3 and PS2
Starting price: your soul
price?
Love from nepal ❤️🇳🇵
Look at the knife 😂
This is crazy and awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if sheldon cooper invented it
I hope they still sell this pc
But like let me get this bro 🙄
Nice, all in one gaming device!
Me: So how much does it cost?<br><br><br>Origin: It&#39;s awesome right?
noo it is known as 2 Boxens
I want that unboxing knife he used
all the systems together is less than 2 grand.
but, the ps5 is coming out... 😂
New Studio is amazing
Does he keep all this shit?
Your wire management gives me <b>aids</b>
This is called sick design bro!!
Why do you unbox these things when 97 percent of your subs can&#39;t afford these
Payment methods-:<br>• MasterCard<br>• Visa<br>• Slavery for 7 Generations
🤐🤐🤐🤐
Imagine playing super Mario in this setup
Starting price : bent over
Loved the dog at the end
Does anybody know what game he was playing in the pc
that is the new definition of gaming master race !
The guy sitting in couch and playing spider man in green shirt .. is he is the same one designed a kindle Inapired phone .. both look same 😅
It may be big but, the price is way bigger
Should have waited 1 more year, imagine it having a ps5 in there
Brun
Something made for the minecraft better-together update
ill come back when im rich, mark m words
Xbox lookin fluid haha
I like the fact that he is playing spiderman in the background (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErQQc6cUSTA&amp;t=300">5:00</a>)
The internet&#39;s fakest salesman
The amount of pleasure this video has given me is orgasmic.
I cried a little, I would suspect if Jesus was a Pc this would be him in all his glory
How much money would it cost to build this?
It would be more impressive if they just built one mega cpu and GPU that plays them both, xbox1, X ,playstation 2,3 &amp; 4.<br>And we just use our own ram cartridges and our own M.2 memory
I may just have an orgasm. That was graphic.
thats  illegal
So it is literally priceless because this is a one of, and they are not planning to make anymore. This was a tribute for their 10 anniversary as a company I believe.<br>But doing a fast ballpark estimate including the components retail price and including unique design features I would say north of 10000$ but could be much more, absolute minimum would be 8000$.
PC2 CONFIRMED 2020
The humming was funny
What if PlayStation 5 and new Xbox and android arcade 999 pc
But can it beat goku though?
2070 kid - my watch is move powerful than this box of tin.
Video starts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErQQc6cUSTA">0:00</a><br>Me: sorry i had tacos
get the BESTEST, MOST EXPENSIVE BATTERY BANK, PLUG TO THIS BAD BOI! AND BAM, IT&#39;S A REAL &quot;ALL-IN-ONE&quot; PORTABLE GAMING SYSTEM! (you&#39;d be broke by now begging for money on the street or making gaming vids for a living)
cool, but why would you need an xbox there if you can play their games on windows 10?
Hey,<br>just wondering if you want to give it away
Like if PS5 is a reality.
I bet they regret buying this now! Hahahaha! Ps5 baby!
Thats nice would have bought it a few years ago. Not now Im into powerful pcs.
I&#39;m watching this after ps5 is announced
You cant even get this specific desktop
Me at a gaming event:                                          Everyone:👀👀👀👀
Every Gamer&#39;s Greatest Dream:
hi, suggest you review mumba grip case and carry box, they are great.
Wait its only $2000 tho that’s basically 2 iPhones
The Outdated once new systems come out
This pc is more expensive than my house
What monitor were they using for over watch?
i may have missed it but if you connect multiple screens can you play more than 1 console at once?
Could&#39;ve just duct taped the consoles on the pc setup
Overkill is not in this computer&#39;s vocabulary
