I love wired earbuds, I never have to worry about losing one if one earbud falls out, and it takes like 3 sec to switch between devices. I hate wireless earbuds since it takes longer for me to connect and disconnect them and they rarely fit well in my ears, also they can lag. In essence, I absolutely detest what Apple has done.
came from would beats by dre pay 20k for us to say that they are great
Srsly I thought you were carrying a bunch of pebbles LOL! 😅
Sony ;i have headphone jack😅😅
Even dollar tree makes a pair of wireless headphones
Son loves them
this was actually such a weird era<br><br>why did everyone think any wireless ear buds were copying airpods? like apple didnt own the vague market of wireless earbuds
Say what you want<br>Apple absolutely, single handedly accelerated the wireless audio trend by a decade at least<br>And it’s just SO much better and due to it, became the norm rather quickly<br>That’s their play always<br>They will do it again with the eSIM iPhones<br>And again once they remove all the ports<br>You just gotta hand it to them, they <b>make</b> evolution happen when they want
Apple sets a trend, everyone critices it and then adopts the trend..eg tws earphones, Notch, charger, packaging style etc
Let&#39;s be real, if you need to have this explained to you in a video, you might be learning disabled.
I am kinda scared when Apple drops out the charging port<br>I don&#39;t think wireless charging is convenient
Money! That&#39;s the answer.
The best apple ads 👌
Apple copied <br>Always on display <br>Super steady<br>Portrait video <br>Telephoto lense<br>I don&#39;t think the word copy should be use in IT
Even Louis Vuitton made “Air Pods“
For perspective: AirPods making 8 Billion means if everyone on earth pitched in a dollar, there would still be 700 Million dollars left
I got AirPods for 8 bucks 💀💀
Just buy  a sennheiser hd 600 and listen music at home with full audio fidelity.
Apple didn&#39;t invent wireless earbud form factor. Onkyo did in 2015. They just consumerised it first. I know this is not claimed in this video but the direction of the story implies it came Apple.
They made 8 billion just from taking away a port
If you’re watching the video with AirPods<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>👇
I have the 4a 5g and the headphone jack is essential for gaming imo. <br>The Bluetooth lag makes it impossible to play call of duty or other quick games...
Soundpeats is aslo a great earbuds company, like really good. 💯
But I’m still don’t using Air pods😅
Intro song?
1 year later and NOBODY wants to discuss the lack of gravity at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=248">4:08</a>?
can someone explain why people like this thing? they are too small! easy to lose! it can get stuck anywhere, why do people buy this? honest question
apple is the smartest business out there tbh
I use Sudio earbuds and I’ve been enjoying use them.
I’m watching this with my pros lol
Rog phones still holding up the headphone jack <br>Chad ASUS🗿
Lol my Apple Watch never falls off my wrist 😉
Can you make a video of the samsung s23 ultra?
Everyone is copying them because apple is best
Android is awfull
i hate another brands only apple i like i like sony only for gaming consoles
million or billion
This is what’s going to happen with the dynamic island on the iPhone 14
2 years later S21 and S22 no headphone jack OR micro SD card slot🤣🤣🤣😐😑🤐
You know there’s hella AirPods when I went to school and copped 4 of em in a week
im watching this video in 40 dollar home depot earbuds pro (i dont think they sell them anymore
Samsung introduced buds way before apple with gearicon x and still provided headphone jack and only removed them after 5 yrs . That&#39;s the sensible way of doing something
hello i need perfect airpods pro fakes: very good sound, very good anc, very good quality... please reply to my comment if you know some!
Me watching this video with a clone airpods. 🤤
I Freakin hate Wireless stuff generally 🤷‍♂️
someone gimme a flagship phone with a headphone jack ... hate wireless headphones !!!
Just watched this in 2022..<br>Now even ALDI are selling copies.
You forgot about the samsung beans
Dude chill
It’s for the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>M O N E Y</b>
The ones that are not clones are actually better then AirPods and the battery is better
There&#39;s pros and cons to it.<br>Wired ones gets damaged easily and stops functioning in one of the earphone.
fuck just relized my ones are called TWS-1107 but they are something like streetz
Apple be the Company to remove battery from their phones and sell you power banks as a solution
Watching this video with my Xiaomi 11 Lite with no earphone jack. Ha ha.
One day we all might become cordless.
Yeah.. Solving a problem that you created 30 minutes ago is a good money maker.
Pros are,180 at target
Nobody at Apple understands courage as a concept, their presentations reek of American marketing bullshit.
I will never steal your footage, but I DO intend to steal your red/black color scheme.
I now must charge my ear buds. Along side my Phone. Cords just work, they are cheap and so no buds for me.
do airpods work with samsung?
I feel that a lot of brands just now have decided jut to copy apple because when apple decided to remove the charging port, all the other companies started to do the same and now the AirPods. I&#39;m not saying that <b>all companies</b> copy apple but a lot of them do
I would just like to see more companies using the same form factor as Apple earbuds. I have tried the standard style of &quot;in&quot; ear vs whatever the Apple style is and the standard ones just keep falling out no matter how small the rubber things are. Apple style stay in my ear unless given a solid tug, basic head movement wiggles standard ones out. I just want earbuds that stay in my ear but allow pause/play and volume control on my android phone. I grew to love those controls when I had an iPhone but when I moved to Android I had to give it up!
The world will be covered with platic waste since airpods has a 2 years of lifetime.
First of all how fooled iSheeps are laughing at other companies who followed Apple is funny. This is the reason one should not be so loyal or become addicted to any company products. Apple milking iSheep with such henious business tactics which are not smart as the guy told. Here there is nothing smart, Apple knows that iSheep never leave it. So much so confidence on iSheep that it took that brave step and sold notched iPhones for four years and featureless phones for many years.<br><br>When I moved to Canada simply I too became an iSheep and bought iPhones, Apple Watch and Airpods. Never used Airpods like how people stuck them in their ears like a new grown organ. It still lying in my drawer. I always preferred wired earphones with 3.5 mm jacks both for iPhones used and my current Note 9. I easily moved out of Apple products that so called ecosystem and bought a refurbished Note 9 and I am quite happy with it even it&#39;s a four year old phone. Never I felt I have missed something except camera quality for which I ordered S22 Ultra. Again not going to be a Samsung sheep and I will easyly move to iPhone in future if I want. So, when people are like me companies Iike Apple can&#39;t play with their consumers. Just don&#39;t get addict.<br>Companies like Samsung and Google has really no reason to follow Apple and they can easily keep head phone jack in their phones. It&#39;s a shame the CEOs of their companies following Apple and fueling Apple sales and makng iSheep proud.
Apple makes average products, but they are steering the entire tech industry. I myself don&#39;t like Apple products, but I&#39;d be a fool if I didn&#39;t acknowledge they know what they&#39;re doing.
still remember where people mocks airpod where it first came but look how every company now release their own &quot;airpods&quot; lol
Bruv this like saying every company copied apple by making smartphones
I just got AirPods Pro yesterday. They are amazing
Can you Look in to the Adidas ear pods
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=258">4:18</a> haha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=222">3:42</a> bruh wtf is that shit
When will we get bigger ipads
Me who uses headsets🎧
Now I understand how every tiktoker has airpods
Not gonna lie I use AirPods(1st Gen and Pro), I would love to try out other wireless headphones but they…even though are expensive, they look cheap to me. Samsung, Nord, and who ever else sells these things. I have multiple pairs of headsets and nothing in my collection comes close to AirPods Pro. And I used to wear wired headphones all the time and not much impresses me nowadays. Great video, great explanation of the timeline.
Yo i was at the park and i found AirPod 2 in a case completely charged for free!!
Apple in 2025: So we removed the screen <br>Apple in 2026:Buy our screen pods to recreate the visual experience of using an i phone
competition bringings inovation
Facts
Short answer <br>The AirPods are good
I just love how he forgot the background music :)
Soundcore is good
Earbuds aren&#39;t the best option in audio quality, BUUUT for casual listeners like me, good tws earbuds are really impresive
Me watching this video on a cheap knock of airpods pro.
tldr; money
My Samsung has an headphone jack but even if i never use that port because i have galaxy buds, i like to have it because others don&#39;t😂.
Apple do be having the last laugh even with the “no charger in the box” 💀
So I&#39;ve only recently started using this type of earbuds... and I just HATE. THEM. SO. MUCH. Especially since they fell into my cauldron while I was cooking.
I lost my AirPods got the beats pods and lost the left piece they’re so easy to lose
Spoiler alert &quot;they sell&quot;
I prefer to have the jack AND wireless option, lossing it is just pointless.
$30CAD JLab GO Air POP... I bought a red and a black pair.<br>Thanks Apple!
Wait a minute.......you&#39;re saying AirPods are more successful than the iPad?
Love how everyone criticized the removal of the headphone jack, and then all other brands started copying apple
(Ryder)
$29 for something that fits vs $250 for something that falls off in the toilet.
Watching this video with a copy airdpods pro:)
that intro tho!!
I just hate the noise cancelling mushroom things on all in ear buds, best way to find ones without them is look for air pod clones.
FUCK EAR BUD AIRPODS!! HEADPHONES ALL THE WAY
I cant belive someone would buy airpods for 300$ while they can buy better ones for 50$
i would get airpods but i wanna keep my kidney
Didn’t the old iPhones also come with the headset ?! Not sure….
Why has the mobile phone changed since the iPhone came out ?
I think part of why the AirPods &quot;concept&quot; is copied so much is because it solved so many issues with the wireless earbud solutions from before.<br><br>Instead of connecting them with a wire, they&#39;re totally wireless in a case. They have their own battery, and the case does too, which helps keep them charged without fitting all that battery inside them. Also, the existence of the case makes it much harder to lose the buds, either among the things in your pocket, or by them falling out of it. The buds automatically turn on when the case is opened, and off when it&#39;s shut. Probably a few other really nice conveniences I&#39;m missing.<br><br>All the little niggles that people had towards bluetooth earbuds were solved with very simple solutions. And because these solutions were relatively simple, off-brands could adopt them and make cheap knock-offs, so even if you didn&#39;t want to shell big money for Apple, Google, Samsung, Sony, etc&#39;s wireless buds, you could still enjoy earbuds on your headphone jack-less phone.<br><br>I think it was this perfect storm, of wireless earbuds getting a lot better so more people adopted them, which allowed companies to feel more comfortable removing the headphone jack, which pushed more adoption, that caused this surge in wireless earbuds aping Apple.
No really I thought 2 per ear!
The headphone jack is like a manual transmission, whereas the adapter jack version is like a DCT.
I typed this up after Jidion mentioned it but i still love the content dude
Ports <br>Eew
Im now suprised my new 1+ actually has a headphone jack now
Uh, because they all copy Apple ALL THE TIME.  What else has even happened in tech?  Microsoft was the original champion copier, then Google and the lame Android copiers.  Companies like SameSong weren’t even capable of copying the software, so Google did it for them.  Dell’s marketing was re-warmed Apple marketing.
i would be fine with no headphone jack is they just included wireless earbuds with the phones even really cheap ones i would be fine with because its nice and enables people to listen to stuff without annoying other people but companies gotta greed
Airpods are the solution to wires which get tangled up. Not to missing 3.5mm jacks.
To be fair, wires are stupid.
Right in google inpods
R.I.P head phone jack
No problem in copying a feature or design if it&#39;s a good innovation
Ur were in a vid of mrwhosetheboss in a giveaways of Ps5 iphones and alot more
Some are copying but other have a whole different design
its like saying headphones copied the first headphones
I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time
I like my KZ ZSN Pros. Wired is the way to go for earphones imo. If I want wireless, I have overears and speakers. I don&#39;t need earbuds as well.
this video is beautifly made.
I just hate how often the AirPods break. Now I have to get another pair.
That’s crazy they used your video to sell their fraudulent products. 😧
Thank you apple for making androed phones less usefull
Apple coureges meaning wee want force you to by our new product
I love my cables not evrething has to be wierles
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=260">4:20</a> that has nothing to do with airpods clones... but thats just- thats just funny 😂
POV: everyone’s favourite technology reviewer
Great review!!!!!
Me who has EarPods and also traditional earphones with a minidisc 💽 player 😎😁
me who is watching this using a pair of ALDI earbuds
Senheizer made TWS earbuds 14 years ago and i almost bought Here One buds 4 years ago, two years ago i purchased sony wf 1000xm3&#39;s and now i have sony wf 1000xm4&#39;s, point being Apple was never &quot;ahead&quot; They are just great at marketing.
Man’s pulls out razer wireless ear buds <br>When I’m still shocked RAZER MAKES PHONES
2030: The new Google Pixel still features a charging port and speakers.
wireless pc
so true about wired headphones becoming an enthusiast thing<br>the common person is gravitated to wireless not realizing wired accessories still are faster and better but wireless are just a bit more convenient
Onkyo 2015: creates worlds first wireless earbuds. <br><br>Apple 2016: Look what we invented!<br><br>MKBHD: wHy dOeS evErYoNe coPY aPpLe?
Just a small tiny nuance. Are headphone jacks incompatible with wireless headphones? Do you really need to remove jack all together for wireless to work? Retorical question obviously
Last time I saw you you had only 2k subs
Everyone: <b>Mocks Apple</b><br><br><b>copies the same thing later</b> <br><br>Actions speak louder than words.
literally ! everyone copied when the first iphone launched
At least xiaomi doesnt get rid of their headphone jacks. and hey, what do you know? TRUE WIRELESS EARBUDS STILL WORK WITH THEM. imagine that. having both options is better than just having 1. i got some wired audio technica cups i use for mastering that work great with my phone. fuck apple.
I&#39;m just disappointed ugh when Samsung is being copped be apple nobody cares but the other way round well well then world war 3 starts
Why did you show beats that is owned by Apple.
Me listening in fake airpods.
Apple also invests $20 billion in R&amp;D.
I love the headphone jack I use it all the time I hate that apple took it away
Rip headphone jack 1878-2019
I actually have a pair of Raycons and I love them. I usually use them when I’m at the gym or I’m at home playing Minecraft. The sound quality is just as amazing as all the other top name brands and they’re half the price. The ones I’m using are the everyday E25’s. They’re the best ones yet. 6 hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing, more bass, available in multiple colors, and their compact design helps get rid of background noise. I also like the fact that you can click either earbud with your finger to pause your music. Makes it super convenient if you need to stop for any reason.
Even, if I&#39;m not fan of this channel I want to say lags on AirPods gen. 2 are real, if you do watch stream or video. Sadly JBL is into this too.<br>THE BIG THING. When I came to one of biggest stores electronic company for a wired WIRED headphones I could only see $5 or $20 one. Others were wireless. People are being silly and believe that wireless headphones are better. Sure Apple headphones with Apple devices works great and sound also but there&#39;s a problem. Even, if I love eco system that is isnide Apple lags with wireless headphones gen. 2 are real. And on top of that those are one of the best. I won&#39;t like to try other wireless headphones that will have even more problems. I can&#39;t actually agree so much on opinion of wireless sound quality. AirPods are really good. They&#39;re best headphones I had and have with me. I had various of headphones and not they were not that expensive as AirPods. I didn&#39;t bought AirPods so it is win win situation. I didn&#39;t had to pay for them but I would for even gen. 3. After using for 2 months of gen. 2&#39;s I can say this is just too good apart from using them as stream or as it was said to video editing. They are like $150 but I agree with some people and they could just cost a little bit less like $125-130. But when I see that JBL same priced headphones are with same price I can&#39;t say they should be priced lower. JBL can have good sound but it is probably similar. I won&#39;t change my wireless headphones for JBLs just because how good quality and compability they have with not only Siri but other major factors.
How he gonna put beats on the list of making headphones to compete with AirPods if apple literally owns beats.
AirPod maxes coming in with 500 price tag and people bought it tho and it’s good
Samsung made it first, apple just copied and got popular from it
Any apple sheep will buy anything with an apple logo on it
Me literally confused while watching this using wired lightning port headphones and no dongle adapter.…
Simple, its the future of phone technology. Same thing as screen resolution, touch screen or cameras in the phone.
im honestly glad that samsung is being the last company to remove the headphone jack
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎
Credit is never given to Samsung for making the first true wireless earbuds from a major company, the gear icon x were really special they had tons of bass and you could store hundreds of songs onto the buds themselves. Apple definitely took it a step further by removing the headphone jack but the gear iconx get absolutely no mention or credit.
I will never understand why someone would want to copy a design that is literally the worst design for an earbuds. I get the case copy I get the little stem sticking out being copied I don&#39;t understand the easy to fall out of your ear part being copied.
Tbh AirPods Pro are the best earphones I have ever used, they also beat most over the ear, earphones to in my opinion, just my opinion but still.
Lmao apple has done a lot of things but in Bangladesh people still can&#39;t create an apple ID with Their own region. They have to create accounts with other regions .
I was using blue tooth for awhile mainly because my cats destroyed all my wired headphones. They see string they attack sometimes while they were connected to me.
When you just upgraded from galaxy s6 to s21 and you bux wirelss earbuds from oneplus and not samsung lol
wanting to go completely wireless but took them forever just to implement wireless charging onto their phones. 🤣
Did I jump dimensions because where I’m from THERE WAS NO iPhone 7?!?!?!?!
Who here is watching an AirPod video with their AirPods in their ear lol
I’m still waiting for a self charging iPhone
Hows that phone hanging on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=249">4:09</a>
tldr: its popular
AirPods 3rd gen are amazing
From what i know wireless is more dangerous than the wired cus of radiation of course after yrs of use<br>Iam fine with a wired headphones
The Airpods is a very good innovation. I acknowledge the fact it is a game changer and more convenient than wired earphones. I just don&#39;t like that they removed jacks for earphones. Why can&#39;t both exist at the same time?
Got an AirPods ad while watching lmao
Don&#39;t be a &quot;iStupid&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=145">2:25</a> he says 8 billion and then goes to the chart and puts 8 million nobody going to point it out?
amazing
i used to love the wired bose sports headphones.  they were discontinued  2 years ago so i was forced into the wireless world.  i must say that i actually like wired BT head phones, and i wish i had given them a shot a long time ago.  but i wouldn&#39;t dare pay $250 for ear pods. i&#39;d lose those things in 10 minutes flat
other companies thought people are smart and they won&#39;t fall for it. But then they saw apple is making money and they had to enter. <br>Apple is smart no doubt they make finest products but most of them are unnecessary and people don&#39;t realize it. Apple make them believe these things are necessary and make best product accordingly. <br>if someone challenge Apple they can even sell shit for ton of money and people will buy it. hats off to their marketing!!
Other companies blame Apple, but copy dame feature in next updates.<br>Finger print unlock, Face unlock, Removal of Headphone jack, Airpods. <br>Apple implemented and other copied them.
Listening to this with fake AirPods 2
Because everyone wants them without paying a whole salary. explained in 1 sentence so people after me dont have to waste 8 minutes on a nonsense video. <br>NP
FiiO btr3k I can use all my favourite wired headphones…
Apple started doing that design after all the other wireless earbuds
This lack of a aux input is the worst idea on phones. I have some great wired headphones that I do want to use without the stupid dongle as I listen to music on my phone whilst doing many other things. I hate esrbuds and wireless headphones due to the crap sound plus they&#39;re very uncomfortable to me.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=102">1:42</a> WHAT THE HELL IS TICKTICK
Yes
Apple copied another company!
you didn&#39;t even say the most important factor here. The microphone of the airpods is the best compared to all these copy
apple didnt even invent true wireless headphones with cases and automatic connecting etc
a Japanese company named Onkyo in the year 2015 made the first earbud tho
You talking about AirPods. Dude every smartphone today is a copy of the iPhone.
Apple is the best<br>Then there&#39;s the copies of it
It’s because everyone copies apple.   They can make fun of, make commercials, and do all that other jazz, but at the end of the day when apple does something everyone else falls in line.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=480">8:00</a> Save your time
Haha
i love how the intro was over the half of the video
OHHH SO THATS WHY IPHONE 7 DIDNT HAVE A EARPHONE HOLE
Apple walked so the others can run and that’s a fact

👍🥺😩I have been beaten into submission. Although I hate hate hate it, from a dependability perspective….I have to accept the mustache &amp; earbuds because I can literally work from anywhere without a separate laptop computer (if I don’t want to) from anywhere in the world using those two tools. It is what it is. 🥺😩😃 It’s a love &amp; hate relationship.💝
Airpods looks like old apple earphones with the wires cut off lol
Sony products are good, but my god, if you are going up against Apple, who is known for simple impactful names, don’t name products WX-4whatevers…
Motorola still going strong with he headphone jack though 💪
hu sad it wl cm  covd 9 hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhaaaaaahhhhhhaaaaa
Could you please make a video of the new Sony WF1000XM4? (8hr battery life, much more compact case and foam tip fit)<br>If possible please make a comparison between Airpods 3 vs Airpods Pro? (6hrs battery life being the most difficult part)<br>Since the black Friday and Holiday seasons are coming, so many people are really struggling to make a purchase. Thanks in advance.
Are all wireless earbuds copies of airpods now?
Who has learned it since birth?<br> Everyone is learning from each other<br> Don&#39;t talk too much about copycats
I thought companies made wireless headphones before ipods too
Apple before:no headphone jack<br>Apple now:no wire headphones<br>Apple in the future: no audio
The 5.1 k dislikes are only the AirPod copiers.
When apple introduces something new.<br>Other companies: 😂😂😂<br>also other companies: 👍🏻🙂
&quot;Courageous&quot; haha shut the fuck up. It&#39;s fine to tactically do it, but don&#39;t call yourself courageous while doing it
Sadly, I have black “airpod pros”!<br>For Christmas I want gen 1s!
Waiting for wireless desktops with wireless power that doesn&#39;t need wired charging. Will I see wireless power widely available in this lifetime? Will we one day we able to power everything wirelessly and not through a wall socket? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
I watched this w/ AirPods
IKBHD
The reason those companies were stealing Marquese’s videos are because they are too good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=276">4:36</a> name??
The copied it there are fake iphones
yet apple doesn&#39;t have wraparound screen technology 😂
I think it was Sony who actually introduced their wireless earbuds. <br>Years before the airpods. <br>I believe they were also the first one to the smart watch business. <br>We don&#39;t give enough credit to them.
How children learn new things? By copying their parent! 🤣
Google making fun of it in their ads and then doing it <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/CN2m5cKr49sCFYbFggodDFEKrg"></a>
Pods are everywhere now
SAME
Make fun of apple, then copy it later on..... basically aNdRiOd lol
Apple removes the headphone jack<br><br>Other companies: “You were supposed to destroy the sith, not join them!”<br><br>Also other companies: “This is where the fun begins.”
I think one day the only cable that people will have is to plug in their table. The surface of that table will be a touch/wireless charger for computers, phones, headphones, speakers, etc.
i got airpods 2 today. I love them.
And here I am in 2021 still using my wired headphones that came in the box for my XR with my 13 Pro.
You are genius
When the AirPods got released, I went and got them. Back then, I had my iPhone 6S Plus, which - mind you - had a headphone jack. And I got my first iPhone without headphones jack two years later, while buying a second Gen pair of AirPods. And something that’s good enough to make me (and millions of other people) come back for more of course gets copied.
i got a honey ad that has marques brownlee on it on a marques brownlee video
&quot;It&#39;s smart business&quot; of course, nowadays is easy to fool people.
The wired headphones were actually a major problem in futuristic truly wireless ecosystem. So it eas not like Apple created a problem and then also gave the solution. Apple actually made the world aware about the problem much sooner by becoming early in the market for TWS headphones
Lol if people are not looking for a deal and just purchase them ok apple wesbite . They won’t get scam . <br>And also there is no” technology “ in this ear bud. Some factory who copy them are actually oem manufacturer . Lol peoole just think “ they sound differently “ they are just as bad
You just forgot jbl
This video is posted on my birthday 😄😄😄😄😄
Basically all the other smartphone makers around the world just copy what Apple does. Home button, Notch Screen, Wireless Headphones,4 Cameras....and I mean almost everything.
I spent a week with AirPods.  I sent them back because they would randomly fall out of my ears.
It’s 2022 here already. N THERES STILL A NOTCH
The real question why is everyone copying apple
I always feel disgusted when I see stolen footages from this channel being used in other youtube channels. They are so shameless Lol.
Because they’re overpriced<br><br>No problem
Sony naming their Bluetooth ear buds: xdfrgtnsrtgdftbxdfgdxhtsrehtfxnstrhethsxtrbresgtdxbtrehesrgfdxbrtshstdbntry543ywergdttj6r5i5e475w46w436a43y
I wonder if in the near future we will have the problem of Bluetooth signals interfering each other
Why copy? Human ears 👂🏽 aren’t invented by Apple company and EarPods must somehow fit in the ears, and headset pods used to exist long before Apple started to produce it the difference is just they used to be with cable 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=70">1:10</a> lmao
I have cheap air pod clones. Tws107 / IO7 <br>Got them from my mother in law (she don’t know) they work really well. They charge in the case and they’re cheaply made but been using them for a year and they honestly work really well. Last ages too. As good as my 60 plus pound Sony ones. I previously got given other air pod clones but they didn’t sync to video so they didn’t work so well and died after a few hours.
I PREFER NECKBANDS..<br>need to charge once nd continue listning even in longest ever flight
me watching this video with my airpods pro and MacBook pro
Love from Sierra Leone.
It&#39;s Awesome how you explain about these stuffs like you work there.❤️
Wow, Amazing content bro.❤️
Wait. Why are my airpods there?!
You only understand how good they are once you’ve tried wireless earbuds . Not being attached to the phone is great 👍
Thanks! I was really confused why there were so many more pods from many companies
Love your content bro, really informative and you bring up great points.

Honestly the Sony wireless buds did not fit into my ear well at all. They may have better ANC for those who can actually wear them, but my airpod pros fit snug into my ear and I can barely hear anything when they’re on. Not tryna be bias but they aren’t that great imo
Hey at least Apple created one trend instead of following. And this is coming from an iPhone user
What about Skullcandy Truly wireless earbuds
Except airpods themselves copied the form from a little known company called bragi, they&#39;re probably the first in coming up with a truly wireless..<br>So may be we&#39;re giving too much credit to apple here
I ruthlessly buy those airpod clones . <br>Who has money to waste on a device with 5 hr battery <br>When you can have 4 🤷🏾‍♀️
im watching a tech vid at 144p my wifi and laptop are trash

I love Bluetooth earphones and I hate truly wireless. The worst form-factor of BT phones IMO.
The problem is not that the jack disappeared, but that the wires are tangling. I had wireless headphones well before the jack was removed, so I didn&#39;t used the jack at all, sort of how now I don&#39;t use the lightning at all.
Oof
Eight billion dollars from airpods alone. And not a cent from me jajajaja
Will Smith said your name
&quot;I feel like I&#39;ve seen that shape before&quot; took me a second to get it and 🤣🤣
They&#39;re all going in a landfill when the battery dies .-.
I use wireless/bluetooth 🎧 because I don&#39;t like things in my ear.
With how many earbuds there are, you should make a tier list video of every one
No need for a cable when listening to music or a podcast is liberating, especially when travelling. What a shame our favourite pair of wireless earphones will only last for about three years before we need to replace them. And it does not matter how expensive or cheap they were. The tiny non-replaceable rechargeable batteries in them will lose most of their capacity over that time, if you use them or not(!). From four hours per charge down to, say, half an hour.<br><br>Devices with non-replaceable batteries are generally bad for the environment. This is not new. We just get more and more wireless devices, and with them comes the need for many more batteries.<br><br>Hopefully we will get better battery technology in the future (there is research on graphene-based batteries that looks promising). Or maybe some devices can &#39;harvest&#39; energy from the environment (e.g., from the temperature difference between your ear and the air around you).<br><br>But for now, sadly, the &#39;built-in obsolescence timer&#39; is ticking in each device that has a built-in non-replaceable battery...
Sony - Why can’t someone remember the name of our earpods<br>Also Sony - WF1000XM3
Is not courage, it is greed...
First they laugh at you.<br>Then they join you.<br><br>I&#39;m no fanboy of any company. But the reality is Apple is a trailblazer. Other companies may have gotten there first with some product/tech. They may even be better and cheaper at it. But until Apple does it and push the envelope a little further, nobody cares. Android users like to mock Apple but that&#39;s just the cold hard truth.
Only lasted me 1 year 😡😂
is there a reason they still can&#39;t include the headphone jacks?  Those will always be higher quality than wireless.
I can say for 100% that AirPods are garbage headphones. I got my brand new pair for free, and I still think I paid too much for them. The sound is terrible, they get crunchy, they quote you a 5 hour battery, which is a huge joke, I get consistently an hour and a half at the most. They look stupid as hell, and they still cost 150 bucks, and don’t come with wireless charging. I don’t wear them outside my house because I can’t even take myself seriously wearing them. They are such a joke, and I laugh every single time I see somewhere wearing a pair. Fucking idiots
I would prefer a calling/finding features on all Wireless Headphones bcoz of how often I and everyone I know loses them. That would be a great marketable point for selling new wireless headphones. (Not talking about AirPods, it already has it)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=227">3:47</a> the little nice that appeared just made my day
Lol I remember buying the Airpods, couple of months after it got released. One of my co-workers thought it was pretty silly and made fun of me when I wear it while working. Months later he also bought one for himself 🤣. I didnt bother asking him why.
69 nice :)
Everyone&#39;s copying AirPods because they&#39;re good  but expensive af
Wireless chargers have to be plugged in so they aren’t even wireless
I dont think Bluetooth headphones can ever win cable headphones when we go to high end headphones (not beats) like B&amp;W C5<br>Or Fiio
Apple is a scam
Apple copies skinny
Have had my AirPod pros for about a week now it’s been fantastic
d
people be spending 100s on airpods and i&#39;m still using the built in speakers like 👁️👄👁️
Owning a $150 Phone with a headphone jack kinda feels like a privilege now tbh
hey, you know what is wireless? a built in speaker
stupid apple channels i see alot stupid poor apple user here 😂😂😂😂😂😂
no wonder why apple users are poor ans why apple is rich because exist stupid people  apple user are so dumb dumb little brainz
I&#39;m going to break my monitor if Apple removes the lightning connector on the iPhone 13
Galaxy Buds is my most favorite wireless but I am enjoying my freebuds 4i now. More time without charging ❤️
like i am so confused from samsung fans who hate apple while samsung is coping apple xDD
I recently bought some airpod knock offs...the sound quality is nice. My wireless earbuds look kinda similar to the original airpods. Got them for $25!
Planet friendly
Wire cables and tangles are electric waste which is NOT GOOD FOR PLANET.  That’s the reason  why Apple courageously ditched wired earphones. Later because of the fame(planet friendly) other companies are forced to move on. Otherwise loose fame
Bro u forgot skillcandy Indy
I bought airpods pro because my samsung s20 fe has no headphone jack and it’s worth it to buy because apple and android is compatible to each other.
The good seat architecturally whip because archaeology postoperatively worry at a plain stretch. shiny, modern headline
I hate the idea of $200 headphones that&#39;s just another thing that you have to remember to charge. Not everything for everyone has to use all the available tech possible, and this whole no headphone jack thing is unbearably anti consumer.
Listening to this on galaxy buds
Apple only really has the iPhone let’s be real us pc gamers would never buy their computer’s to game on but I do love how fast and easy their phones are to use but they made a problem only to sell a solution that statement is so true
Diss Nikka crazy
Why Not?
Cause the airpods are TRASH, just paying for the logo, you got so many companies out there with better wireless earphones!!
tbh we all gotta accept that apple has the guts to try out new things which android companies can never have
Galaxy buds pro
I thought I saw you on an ad😂
🙏🙏🙏
how are everyone coping airpods how else are you sopousted to make wireless earbuds
What would Asia make if it didn&#39;t have white inventions to copy? Answer: fertilizer made of human feces. Nothing else.

I have the ptron bassbuds pro, nobody knows what it is right?.....just what i expected.......
Everyone copied Apple after clowning them. It’s funny how Apple literally forces the market to change simply because they feel like it.

Fake AirPods Pro is becoming better and better. It&#39;s easy to get excellent fake AirPods Pro now.
The biggest problem with the possibility of Apple getting rid of the lightening connector has nothing to do with the hassle of people needing to get Bluetooth headphones, it has to do with the millions of cars out there that rely on wired Apple Car Play. That would be pretty much unforgivable for me.
How is your voice soo clear?

Would love to see a review of the new buds coming out from Wyze. I have their over ear ones and they are pretty impressive. Especially for the cost. Great video as always. Thanks for all you do.
Just like Apple reinvented the phone they did headphones too
Fact: apple is actually a 1 trillion dollar company

Who else is just watching this in AirPods lol
Me buying a Magsafe Charger because I also had to buy Wired EarPods since the lighting port will be occupied. Also, EarPods didn’t come with my XR because of this ban on wireless and ecowaste.
you never mentioned jbl
If we’re being honest here, the only thing apple did was just get rid of the headphone jack, I mean there were already wireless earbuds available from 90% of these retailers.
Apple in 2050: We have the all new ICar...car sold separately
I got my pods at iplaypods,co and they are INSANE. I love them so much because of their quality. Sound and mic are awesome, noise cancellation is real. Everything is great. My recommendation.
I don’t know how people’s headphone cords save their phones, I mean it reminds me to hold it but usually from high places the cord just disconnects from my phone.
Apple is always epic…
Bcz Apple is a monopoly and don&#39;t allow companies to launch anything they have planned.
The best business strategy is to create a problem that only you can solve. This goes beyond basic business, the world runs on this concept.
This is my first time seeing your name... since rewind 2018...
I love my skullcandys!
thank you for reminding me that the airpods came out 5 years ago... now I feel old.
I dont like not having the option to use wires or be wireless<br>I sometimes do gaming on my phone so I don&#39;t want latency from Bluetooth<br>and sometimes I only use Bluetooth cause I don&#39;t care about latency for sometime<br>I just wish companies stop removing headphone jacks altogether. Makes me sad. I am the customer, I should have voice weather to use wire or not
Samsung did not copy Apple, they released wireless earbuds before AirPods was even announced.
People: it’s sad that apple removed the headphone jack<br>Me with wireless earbuds and a headphone jack: 👁👄👁
How about Rosebuds? <br>That’s a hit waiting to happen!
My biggest problem with airpods is battery! And after getting used to be cord free, I wanted to buy a second one.... But instead of spending on a new airpod, I decided to try Lenovo LP1S and I like it a lot! For a third or less of the price of an airpod, you get a decent bud. I had a Samsung Bud before having airpods and didn&#39;t like it at all, it didn&#39;t charge well and stopped working after a couple of months... So no Samsung for me at all. BUT I highly suggest you all to research good airpod alternatives because there are some really good ones out there.
One line ans: cause people feel cool using apple look alike but know buying apple products is a bad economic investment cause their cost is fraction of the price and not interested in making a trillion dollar company more rich
I watched this through my cheap 5 below true wireless headphones
So no one’s going to talk about all the radiations this “wireless future” is gonna emit....idk
at least apple is clear about it unlike others
For me, wired and wireless earphones are two different things. Niether can replace the other.
Apple definitely should’ve bundled a dongle with both a lightning and aux port
Walkman vs Apple which one do you pick. Use your brain not propaganda.
Apple is nothing compared to Sony when it comes to portable sound period. Only a brainwashed person can listen to this crap full stop.
Forget it, Sony is the best in this category. This is no making cellphones anymore. Apple makes no better headphones than Sony even a fool knows that.
Review Skullcandy jib true
Quality of  apple is better
i’ve said it before and i’ll say it now, removing the headphone jack from phones is fucking stupid, and i’ll stick by this point until the day i die
My answer: apple made them so google started making pixel buds then Microsoft made surface buds then Samsung (🤮) made their galaxy buds. 2019 apple made AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro so google and Microsoft made more. Samsung made galaxy buds plus. It’s 2021 and I still love my AirPods pro :)
I&#39;ve been a hi-end hi-fi enthusiast for 30 years and it is very difficult to please me with sound quality. I used all kinds of earbuds with my iPhone for conversation recently, but their musical performance was mediocre. I did not expect much from Airpods pro either but boy was I surprised! They sound amazing to the point of unbelievable provided their size. So now I can really enjoy my music not only on my hi-end setup at home but on the go too! And while their noise canceling is good, the transparency mode is just perfect.
I watch this video with galaxy buds in school lol
Unpopular opinion: @mrwhosetheboss is WAY better than MKBHD
Just got my new Huawei freebuds 4i, they look almost exactly like airpods pro and actually better than them with a bang for the buck price,

Do wireless headphones cause cancer?
Are companies even trying to compete with Apple anymore?
Indeed! Airpods are most impacted product since 2007 iPhone.
they should like make an iPhone SE third generation with the home button and headphone jack and use the housing of the iPhone 6 plus
If normal AirPods could stick in your ears  then that would be good. I always see my friend working out with earbuds from the iPhone box instead of his airpods
What about RHA trueconnect
When you listed beats as a company that also clones AirPods even though they don&#39;t have a phone, did you forget that beats was bought by apple in 2014?
as much as I hate apple and their decisions of making a problem and selling you the solution, at least they aren&#39;t hypocrites that try to gain as much coverage before eventually copying the same company they made fun of, isn&#39;t that right, samsung, xiaomi, one plus?

Not everyone copied.... Samsung didn&#39;t copy it cos their buds design is completely different
One word: MONEY
Having a iPhone 6 now
Why copy Apple ?<br><br>Because no one, and I mean No One is better than Apple at innovating new techniques to milk their gullible customers dry
The possessive star conceivably interfere because scraper neurobiologically slap unlike a ultra colon. wrong, mundane command
The slim salary evocatively cry because sock disconcertingly pour among a cagey gore-tex.  frequent, vague parsnip
The second boy neurologically interest because jeans demographically fold along a grotesque beauty. sulky, brawny office
The thankful cereal neuroanatomically flower because interviewer coronally choke apropos a knowledgeable sphynx. condemned, imperfect pancreas
I prefer wired stuff
Best airpods clones are ones from iplaypods .co. They have all options as apple ones. Great Clones. They have amazing sound and mic quality to. My recommendation.
The numerous roast emphatically attempt because name systemically harass since a spiky random. plant, toothsome helmet
Because people want cheap alternatives? Simple as that.
They didn&#39;t copied airpods they just made wireless earphones, with that same logic apple copyed android.
They criticize and mock Apple, and then they copy Apple and monetize even more. That&#39;s just ugly.
Can&#39;t say If I am watching this video 88th time since it was published 🥱<br>Perfect for me..
I think galaxy buds is better than airpods . they have good grip . and soothing experience than airpods
The nutty digital climatologically disarm because spot exceptionally turn round a abrasive pentagon. orange, ruddy hose
am I the only one who think Marques looks like Gerald from &#39;Hey Arnold&#39;?
Because AirPods is expensive
The headphone jack is a superior technology to wireless, despite its age. Oy...
The Solo pros charge on lighting cable so I just plugged the ear pods with the lightning cable into the Beats solo pros
one does not know if the wireless audio is getting great
its not impossible to ignore why companies copying airpods
Apple see that everyone copying him... so Apple got new idea <br><br>Apple 2025: We shut down <br>Other companies: shut down shut down <br><br>after them Apple launches even better: Now we are only Company you can buy phones and headphones
Airpods sucks. Don&#39;t fit in the ear and to bulky.
&quot;Honey where&#39;s my dongle!?&quot;
Honestly, I had my fair share of replicas and the AirPods Pro replicas are by far the best I’ve ever tried.
The greedy room desirably miss because plain conversly branch mid a learned keyboarding. angry, sick replace
because of the price✌😁
I have a question for you Marques. Does Siri always listen to our conversations
I got the fake ones on the thumbnail 😦
Man I love this guy he explains everythin in detail<br>Cool guy!
The nine motorboat nutritionally mug because sign comparably start plus a real luttuce. troubled, gamy eyeliner
Me watching a AirPods video while wearing AirPods
Apple didnt invent wireless earbuds
Ask a musician about the benefit of going wireless. No benefit exists there. Apple fooled everyone.
I found some for 25 dollars and great reviews(on amazon)
If they in the future remove the charging port and say use wireless charger they better fucking give us wireless chargers in the box not everyone is rich they better not do what they did with the headphones stopped putting them in the box and they also stopped putting charging bricks and say we are trying to save the environment why do they not reduce there fucking price to save trees being cut to make money the saving the environment thing is fucking bullshit save our wallets
The addicted recorder morphologically chop because harbor evolutionarily pretend forenenst a rustic japanese. known, telling range
Imagine being so cheap that you buy clones actually believing that you’re getting a good deal and making an intelligent decision......
This video should have been 1/2 as long....

It’s been exactly one year since this was uploaded!
Still better than Apple... Apple Inc did it when wireless headphones and earphones were not popular. Sure, with music and video editing (which I can relate to) I osn very popular, but for most people, wireless is the go to product. Getting rid of the headphone jack now is less ridiculous than it was in 2016.
2021 and this is recommended to me??..
Let&#39;s do a problem and then we solve the problem we did and then they spend lots of money and say we are a fantastic tech company with awesome technology 🤑💰💰💰💵💸💸💵🤑😂😂😂😂😂😂 Because they are stupid and they never notice
Airpods are the worst looking earbods on the market, but so many copies that shait
I just wanted wireless earbuds I don&#39;t care about having airpods for status
People like to hate on Apple, but they are marketing geniuses &amp; as an owner of iPhone since the 4s, I’ve never once had a screen crack or ANY issue. Apple ecosystem all the way.
I would like an alternative to the airpods because they are the only ones that fit my ear to perfection. The others are terrible. I really dislike the plastic they put in the ear. The airpods (not the Pro) were perfect.
Money that’s the reason
What MacBook skin is that
The tangible lamb nally grin because light sporadically snatch against a husky donkey. dear, hollow dredger
Everyone copies Apple, it&#39;s a known fact.
Um someone will correct me but LG still has the headphone jack in the LG Stylo5 dont know about the LG Stylo6 though someone will tell me
The ripe tadpole serendipitously cheer because aftermath ultrastructually request under a stiff garage. unarmed, rambunctious baseball
Where is Skullcandy in that list??? I have Skullcandy Spoke True Wireless Earbuds, and you didn&#39;t say anything about them. In fact, i&#39;m pretty sure Skullcandy has best quality for the cheapest price
If every one on the earth woud give Apple Air pods 1 dollar the would have ass moch
The worst thing is all these expensive sh*t will start losing battery life due to degradation
I can not live with out my AirPods Pro.. and i hate wires it gets in the way soo very agg
I just got my airpod pros there so comfy and cool
My AirPods get lost while traveling lol
Wireless headphones aren&#39;t great yet. The Beats ad said audio professional use their bluetooth headphones rather than wired reference headphones. The Beats ad is BS.
I feel saying apple forced wireless on you is bullshit considering even if phones had aux cords in 2020 guarantee you wireless would be a huge market still it’s just how technology works wireless is better and people always go with what’s better.
You can try too copy AirPod pro? No one comes close? A fail of fake AirPod nock offs
I got air pod pros for $106 and they are exactly the same, same box, same features, same charger, same case, they look exactly the same, the noise cancellation and the transparency are the same. The only difference is that it doesn’t have an apple logo 👍🏼<br>I bought them not thinking they’ed be as good, but I was proved wrong, the dude I bought them from said they were an exact copy, they all sold out after a <br>week of me buying them. My friend and my sister were sad because they wanted them too 😅
My only issue with wireless earbud is as a Smule user, i still prefer the sound and voice quality from the wired headphones.. and i like to be able to hear my voice simultaneously on the headphone while singing.. i hope in the future they manage to fix this..
Slander Apple Then Copy Them 🤣😂😅
apple beats acquisition gave them lots of returns
Meanwhile ASUS: Nah lets add a couple more charging ports on the phone
i never had airpods, but love the aukey wireless earbuds i have. really great sound and noise cancellation. the iphone even shows the battery percentage. i don&#39;t feel like i&#39;m missing out
Who&#39;s watching in 2021 btw happy new year u all🥳🥳
I mean, it is usual for most major tech to experience copycat devices eventually, as the tech becomes more accessible. But like they say, &quot;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery&quot;<br><br>For now, they are some of the BEST BUDS. But over the months/years, the competitors will get better and we will hardly be able to tell a difference between the two! Similar to how lots of Android phones used to mimick iOS all the way down to the home button, now it sorta looks like iOS tried to follow Android&#39;s notch trend. Tech always evolves, no matter what companies you back! 💯
1  thing: &quot;money&quot;
Apple : Removes headphone jack.<br>Me : Laughs in Nokia 3310.
You didn&#39;t put wwe in the list
Long story short it was so damn successful, so everyone wanted to be successful to get money.

I think its crazy how so many companies have created wireless headphones but none had the courage to make wireless headphone until apple did.
Very interesting video! Personally I&#39;ll always go with wired headphones because no one should want a Bluetooth wireless signal pulsing directly into your head. The radiation exposure isn&#39;t healthy. Purchase an EMF/RF meter and check for yourself. You might be surprised by what you discover.

Because the ear only has one shape ;)

There was no reason to remove the headphone jack, phones already had Bluetooth technology with the jack. All this greed is just annoying and ridiculous. I will not buy a phone that doesn&#39;t have one.
The scary apple rarely discover because turn neuroanatomically signal near a fluttering undershirt. curvy, zany wall

I think people that are copying AirPods is trying to make them real so everyone can buy in the copy person is saying mine is fully real
Beats never copied airpods beats headphones and wireless earphones were out way before airpods so technically airpods copied them. Get it right dont be a hater to dr.dre
I really wish they&#39;d keep the headphone jack on phones, it&#39;s how I&#39;m able to play Spotify on my drum kit, and I would be so pissed to have to upgrade to a $2,000 Roland module just to get Bluetooth.
My main issue is that these all have a form that does not fit well into my ears. I&#39;ve tried them, but they keep falling off. I really miss the headphone jack :(

Apple didn’t create an issue by removing headphone jacks. They just made a different connection option by going wireless. A company can’t offer you 7 different connection ports just because of your nostalgia. Restaurants don’t offer 300 items because it would be impossible to make profitable. Get a mp3 if you like old fashioned headphone jacks. <br><br>Liking Apple is not a cult. Their design philosophy and their operating OS are just leagues above others. What’s wrong with sticking to something if they help you be more productive? Windows, android give you so many headaches that it far outweighs the price difference.
The miniature cougar respectively mess up because broccoli formerly puncture apud a envious cream. imported, lovely raincoat

Hi Marques, <br>I have noticed the AirPods pro that are marked “Apple Distribution International, Hollyhill Industry Estate, Cork, Ireland” are sold a bit cheap than usual and they one or two faults with them. And they are shipped with all the standard accessories and documentation with them.<br>so i was wondering are these ear pieces original and from one of apples plant or they are clones?
The lifespan of these buds is pretty short. Considering everyone is soo concerned about the Environment, shouldn&#39;t we focus on reducing the battery dependent accessories around us? Just a thought..
Few years later: This phone can&#39;t be charged with a cable, It&#39;s a only wireless one!!
Looks like apple is controlling the future of tech.
Ey! This was uploaded on my 15th birthday!

I wonder why AirPod charge so fast and drop so fast
Everyone really was clowning Apple when they removed the headphone jack and looking back it just seems foolish. So many people have wireless earbuds now, whether it&#39;s a name brand or ones off of Amazon, and I don&#39;t even miss it on my phone. Computers still have headphone jacks and that&#39;s enough now.
The peaceful grease relatively blush because swan desirably grate to a like halibut. spurious, loud top
What is dis
Samsung created wireless earphones before AirPods came out in 2016. If anything, Apple is copying Samsung. Look at this. The Galaxy Buds are just another model.<br>Samsung Gear Icon X release date: <b>July 15, 2016</b><br>Apple AirPods release date: <b>December 13, 2016</b>
Disappointed Samsung didn&#39;t name their assistant Sammy.
The ultimate “be careful who you call ugly in middleschool”
Cause it makes them money
Also with apple removing the headphone jack they are actually making more money because every company that makes a gadget that has the lightning port they have to give apple a percentage of the sales because apple made the lightning port that&#39;s a reason why they removed it
I can’t tell you how many times my headphone Cord saved my phone from falling lol
Apple always makes AirPods while others try to imitate; what happened to the earbuds and  headphones???? I always been a fan of them for so long!!!!
Technically you don’t have to use the lightning port if you use wireless charging. (With phones that support it)
I mean they include wire headphones with a lightning adapter in the damn box so you don’t HAVE to get wireless earbuds
Companies making wireless earbuds are good, AirPods are good, but AirPods ripoffs, making bad buds but literally using Apple&#39;s marketing pics are so damn stupid. I tried to get a deal but couldn&#39;t. Quick tip to all, Costco offers a year round $30 discount on AirPods
There&#39;s a way he talks that I feel like he’d do amazing on a TedTalk
When people say how everyone copied Apple in removing the home button... Cough, Cough, Apple copied Motorola, SOny Ecrisson, and Lg in removing their home buttons. Get your facts straight, people.
I was gonna buy airpods, but now i dont want to<br><br>Its not worth it<br><br>i mean it... not<br><br>But im gonna buy them....<br><br>anyway
Dad can you tell me the story of “The Headphone Jack”
<b>Hey you, yeah you there I know you’ve been seeing airpods videos in the past few days and this is one reason why this is recommended to you after almost 1 year</b>
I love and feel more confident with wireless ones but with that wire that goes behind the neck. My bose one has a clip too. Feels so secure.
wow, that was very well said. love the content .. even though i&#39;m late lol.
Beats on that list of ‘no smartphones to connect to’ isn’t very accurate, seeing that Apple owns Beats. <br>That said, great vid.
Apple in 2030: so we removed the phone........
Now that everyone makes earpods we&#39;ll have tons and tons of batteries in landfills, I wish the world would setup a recycling system for these.
Disappointed Samsung didn&#39;t name their assistant Sammy.
Even oppo makes clones
People just buy to flex
Its the opposite of things apple copies everyone as nd calls it innovation

When you watch this Video with a head phone connected to ur phone with a headphone jack
I still like the one with the cord. I don’t like the idea of having to charge my earphones in order to listen to music. Yeah sure those wireless one with looks cool, definitely performs better, but I still can’t let go of my old ones.
I can’t tell you how many times my headphone Cord saved my phone from falling lol
Why chinese are making fake airpods ?Whats the prob?this copy airpods can harm our ears.
how much is airpods pro?
You are apple marketing head of YouTube
Amazingly, despite Sony making some of the best wireless headphones for years and years, their latest Xperia phones (the 1 II &amp; 5 II) both have headphone ports as of 2020. The latter even came out within a few weeks of the iPhone 12!<br><br>Are they the last to keep it?
I have never heard of Razer making phones until today...<br><br>are they as shitty as their mouses and keyboards?
Now that everyone makes earpods we&#39;ll have tons and tons of batteries in landfills, I wish the world would setup a recycling system for these.

Samsung made a mockery about Apple when they&#39;ve removed the headphone jack! than later they also copy the idea! Apple has more knowledge than other companies.
buying the airpods was the best decision for me. now i want to buy the ipad air 4 than i want to buy the apple watch 6. apple is the best! apple haters should shut up!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=79">1:19</a> problem created? are you kidding me? the cable problem is gone and they didn&#39;t created this problem by removing the headphone jack!
I feel like they took a step back with AirPods Pro. I got some last week and I want to return them. They fall out of the ear so easily and taking away the ability to tap to control Siri and play/pause is super annoying.
Finally got Latest Original Airpods at amazon at a low Price.

I don&#39;t know bruh I prefer wearing headphones (not earphone know the difference) it&#39;s good to use and has a noise canceling plus I can use it on my pc plus I dont need to worry about it getting low battery and charge it everytime I go outside
2050:<br><br>The iPhone designer: how many things do you want to get rid of?<br><br><br>Apple: yes
I&#39;m watching this on my ROG phone 2 with two headphone jacks... since the cooler is connected.
Lol I’m watching this with my fakepods
Three words for Apple in this: first mover advantage.
i have a question, does face ID work on the iPad 7th generation?
Disappointed Samsung didn&#39;t name their assistant Sammy.
Its funny when android manufacturers rip on apple but then eventually do the same thing. Just one of the things i always look forward to every few years.
Did he just try to pull off a smolder at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=412">6:52</a>? Coz it worked. T__T
Its just stupid that just because of apple other great companies are getting rid of something useful that everyone wants, just so they can compete or make more money. Its like the opinion or choice of the buyer doesn&#39;t exist its like the companies are battling each other.
Because if it&#39;s apple people will buy it<br>                      <br>                                               Longbeachgriffy.
I love that he has a apple cheese grater in the background
The exact same thing is gonna happen with the Charging Brick.. Apple removed it from their box.. Samsung and other companies have already trolled them for that.. Even consumers are trolling them.. <br>BUT, Next year, at most 2 years later, we’ll see all these companies follow Apple’s lead and remove the charging brick from their boxes..
Now that everyone makes earpods we&#39;ll have tons and tons of batteries in landfills, I wish the world would setup a recycling system for these.
Still don&#39;t think it&#39;s copying apple but taking a recipe and making it better
RIP charger and headphone jack
All tech companies copying apple
I’m a commercial from apple and shhhhhh <br><br><br><br>No I’m joking
I bought fake AirPods in my city at price of US$8.5
I’ve been using bt almost exclusively but for some reason I need a headphone jack on any new device I purchase
I literally hate where they just go for a cash grab and create problems. Then they offer solutions for their problems that are stupidly expensive
we should stop buying headphone jack less phones and start a protest. nah for real
But the galaxy buds been out 4 a while though
The new invisible charger brick is dope!!!!
In 2019:so it’s 2019<br><br>In 2020 ok so it’s 2020 <br><br>In 2021: ok it’s 2021<br><br>Me:Stop acting like 2020 is so cool
i remember buying my first pair of apple earpods. they were fake. i bought it of a platform like amazon, belonging to a trustable name, and i was so disappointed. of course i spotted the fake, who could have hyped up the earpods when they sound so baad. and apple had a guide to spotting a fake. so i got them returned (which took weeks) and cried in my bed, not having earpods (jk). then i bought them from apple directly
Next is the lightning port, I can just see it coming
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=246">4:06</a> whoa its floating
Apple: yes<br>Android: hi<br>Apple: <b>no</b>
Didn&#39;t Samsung make Gear Icon X earphones a few years earlier than Apple?
which is why I N E V E R buy from Apple. I like their product, but the way they extort their fan-base is inexcusable!
Micromax is coming back!
Yeah.... I just upgraded like 3 months or 2 months ago to an iphone 11 from a 6. I literally had no interest in AirPods until now lol.
Look, when my $20 wired headphones/earphones beat your $90 airpods, that&#39;s just me. I admit the airpods seem convenient but I would usually wrap my wired around my phone or something. These airpods and the carrying/charging case, are just another thing I gotta carry on me. I&#39;ll never get an iphone unless work requires me to get imessage or something in which case ill just go to a pawn shop or ebay and buy a very old model iphone. I&#39;m not gonna hate on people who choose to be in that apple ecosystem and everything, you do you, im gonna just do me
Ear buds are crap, over-ear headphones are a much better choice
Is there any chance cheap airpod clones bursting into the ear? Just a thought..

Someone by the username of: &quot;RAZ!&quot; wrote the following down below: &quot;Apple in 2030: so we removed the phone........&quot;<br><br>To that I&#39;d say: In ten years, you&#39;d be surprised how accurate you were, ten years ago.. ; )
I&#39;ve been telling my people this for a long time. Apple is a trend-setting company. As soon as I saw that the headphone jack was going to be eliminated from Apple devices, I already knew it was going to be the way of the future of smartphone designs..
Amazing wireless earbuds you WON’T believe are under $12.00
sponsored by Apple
what&#39;s the point of these wireless headphones when still have to carry them in a case, charge them and drain phone battery cause you are using Bluetooth. I am gonna keep using wired ones
apple in 2016: removing the headphone jack<br>apple in 2020: removing the charger<br>apple in 2025: <b>ok so we removed the camera. . oh yeah and the battery oh wait we removed the phone...</b>
The problem is Bluetooth tech isn&#39;t so special anymore so justifying nearly $200 headphones when $30 options do essentially the same thing with no noticeable variation is getting harder to do
I have a headphone jack in my phone...<br>And I have AirPods <br>👁 👄 👁
Who&#39;s here after Apple removed the power adapter
Me laughing in galaxy a10e
This video should be titled -- Markass Brownlee is an idiot.
Give me a sandwich send oh phone iPhone 📲
Apple adds Facetime in iphone 4: so so stupid, who wants to video call directly<br><br>Apple adds fingerprint sensor in iphone 5s: so so stupid.. what u trying to protect that u need fingerprint unlocking for<br><br>Apple adds apple pay: oh my god so that is insecuree<br><br>Apple removes headphone jack to move towards a new wireless headphones tech: oh my godddd wow losing headphone jack too now?<br><br>Ends copying all of this but no one bats an eye then.
me listening to this video with my airpods like 👂👁👃👁👂
watching this on a macbook 10.6.8
Im in dire need of some ear buds...please🤧
Yes bro copping air phone s
Beats literally is apple
I feel like charging ports are gonna be gone in the iPhone 13
Ah, back in the early days of 2020 when you hear &quot;It&#39;s 2020 and it&#39;s impossible to ignore&quot; and the rest of the sentence has nothing to do with Covid
Everyone are copying each other. Not just tech. Car manufacturers copying head up display, digital dashboard etc. Winner is consumer so we should sit back and enjoy
oh wow u have the apple cheese shreder
Never ridiculed the end of jack. I’ve always thought it was a great opportunity to make people move to the future
Why your copying mrwhosetheboss: explained?!
Personally I don’t think everyone copied earpods I think they copied the charging case
hey tozos are good alright?!
How apple earn lots of money<br>Just create a problem and sell the solution
wtf... why would you compar audio technica fe to airpods? so, audio technica is a specialized brand in sound. Its just normal that they make wireless headphones... looks like apple invented cordless earphones. but they surely wasn&#39;t the first. so who is apple trying to copy?
Cause they can&#39;t use their own brain
Apple does something new, everyone follows.
Funny how evey brand makes fun of apple new product when released but after few month they will create exact copy .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=20">0:20</a><br>“iPhone 7 was the first phone with no headphone jack”<br><br><b>Me instantly thinking about phones old cell phones</b>
Some Youtubers were getting paid, more than Apple store associates to promote Apple products !
Airpods
we live in a time where clones are better than real products were a few years ago. damn!
I hate airpods
Love those surface earbuds
lazyness
nice
Please please can u make a vid about the best budget wireless headphones plzzz thanks
I really love the way MKBHD ends his videos
although apple is always behind in a lot of things android does, it still leads the competition in many ways
Yes but who wants to spend 160 dollars on earbuds
Galaxy Buds gang
YouTube: Lets recommend this After 8 months
&quot;What it really comes down to is&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Money
Beats : <b>*has no phone but makes wireless ear buds against apple*</b><br>Beats : I play both parties so I always come on top.
Explained in one second:money
I don’t see whats wrong with having airpod pros<br>If you saved up money to get the pros then theres nothing wrong<br>But if you beg your parents to get you airpod pros and whine about it then theres something wrong<br>So before you make fun of someone for owning airpod pros and calling them spoiled, greedy and lucky just remember theres a chance that they actually worked hard with jobs to be able to afford product
Because airpods are expensive like my phone is 220
I like headphone jacks 😭
I’m waiting for the EscobarPods Pro
3 words: Airpods. Are. Cool.
Apple : Copies Android features<br>Android Phones : Copy Apple designs <br>Win-Win
My airpods 2.0 is the best compared to all the other clones.
I want the essential jack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=227">3:47</a> well how in hell nobody have mentioned this before
Mouth kol bai busss
Technically there is no wireless earbuds, they all have wires inside
Teh Sentence at the end of the video should be in top 100 best tech qoutes.
And how far they have come, now having to change their phones to usb connection hahahahahaaaaa
Ngl that tcl looks pretty dope
Hey why don&#39;t you take away the speakers too? Then more people can pay $150 for overpriced earbuds!
Okay but, how often do you drop/lose these things? $200 replacement each time is much more expensive than replacing an $8 headphone!
That&#39;s why you are my favorite ❤️
You don’t know how many AirPod copy’s I’ve seen in Ross
What a cold outro
when earbuds are just river pebbles to marques
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=249">4:09</a> <br><br>Okay but h- physics?
well explained
And this is why capitalism is so important
Anyone got some cheap wireless airbuds for me for less than €25?
The hell is a One Plus???
You should have just mentioned the ones who are copying the air pod style because Apple wasn&#39;t the first company to launch a true wireless ear bud. Samsung Icon X was two months ahead.
Hey recommended!
Why did you overlook LG? The LG V60 still has the headphone jack and (as far I know) they&#39;re not planning to kill it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHAB4qDsgKY&amp;t=225">3:45</a> 🤣🤣
Does Apple have a patent on air pods
I’m honestly glad they got rid of headphone jack because it caused wireless technology to exponentially improve in a short time
But sony came out with the nosiecancelling.
Everyone copied Apple keyboards as well, and we&#39;re now left with these awful chiclet keyboards. Terrible design for touch typing
apple is worth 2 trillion dollars
I truely do not understand why anyone wants airpods or any copy of them from different brand.<br><br>They are way too expensive , it is another device that  you have to recharge ,  quality and latency problems , cable is not a big deal for me and it saved my phone few times from falling<br>why to try make things wireless - higher battery consummation, when our phones can&#39;t stay charged for a week without recharge when we using the phones......<br><br>for me the last big bangs at mobile phones was touch display and HQ camera,   the next thing i really need for my phone is the battery that will revolutionise the industry <br><br>i know that Tesla wanted world wireless , but first things first   his idea was that everyone has free energy and it is wireless , now imagine walking in any city and your phone is getting charged up...
Great video, unfortunately I really do love the “head phone Jack” because I’ve use my external rode microphone shotgun that goes into the headphone Jack ....to power that independently from the lightning Bolt cable to charge the phone on my iPhone 6s ....brilliant concept and setup especially for streaming live you never run out of power and you got a independent microphone going into the Jack. With these new phones there’s no way of independently bringing a microphone to the party and powering the phone at the same time !!  without the feedback buzzing through that same adapter, crazy hey sometimes innovation isn’t always better, keep up the great work Marques cheers Andrew⚔️
Take notes people, this just shows the people laughing in the sidelines don’t know shit.
Remember pre 2020 2020 those days
It&#39;s bullshit is what it is. Bluetooth is easily hijacked and they&#39;re leaving us all open. And then the &quot;can&#39;t remove the battery&quot; Bullshit. Remember when you could buy a battery if your battery went bad? Now you have to hope you have warranty or something on your piece of shit phone.
my mans gotta get nvidia rtx jeez is  it loud in th ebackground

Being different at the expense of utility: Apple
My broke ass got the Tozo t-6 earbuds. Not very loud and fall out of my ears but wtf.. no headphone jack so I had too lol.
Skullcandy
Me Watching this vid with airpods
If everyone is copying apple then why apple is always copying Samsung and then rebranding those technology and products
