I am in the exacerbation stage of my depression and anxiety disorder and came across this video. I&#39;m sitting and crying, because happiness is so simple. Beautiful song, artists and their emotions. I know my comment will get lost among others and never be seen by anyone, I just want to write that it would be nice to smile like this someday.
Anyone here from 2023 or 2024?
This feels like when you jam with your friends in an empty classroom, after school hours. Really wholesome and just pure
Que acústico bom ,não canso de ouvir ❤

CANT ANYONE ELSE SEE THIS, OR IS IT JUST ME??<br> They obviously had a fling, if you look closely its easy to tell that she&#39;s really REALLY captivated and smitten by Ed.
I will always remember<br>The day you kissed my lips<br>Light as a feather<br>And it went just like this<br>No, it&#39;s never been better<br>Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)<br>Uh, we were only eleven<br>But acting like grown-ups<br>Like we are in the present<br>Drinking from plastic cups<br>Singing, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;<br>Well, I guess that was true<br>Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>Songs with all our childhood friends<br>And it went like this, say<br>Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>Paint a picture for you and me<br>On the days when we were young, uh<br>Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>Now we&#39;re under the covers<br>Fast forward to eighteen<br>We are more than lovers<br>Yeah, we are all we need<br>When we&#39;re holding each other<br>I&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)<br>Yeah<br>Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>Songs with all our childhood friends<br>And it went like this, say<br>Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>Paint a picture for you and me<br>On the days when we were young, uh<br>Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>Songs with all our childhood friends<br>Oh, now<br>Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>Better hit me, baby, one more time<br>Paint a picture for you and me<br>On the days when we were young<br>Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>On the day we fell in love, love, love

lovely couple
Maybe this is why Ed Sheeran is a better singer than we realise...<br>Because he doesn&#39;t go &quot;uh&quot; or laugh while performing and ruining the song

Beautiful voice! They actually looked like they had fun doing this...... AWESOME!!
静電気？
Anne-Marie&#39;s voice does not need auto tune. Her voice already sounds one even when there&#39;s no autotune.❤
😍😍😍
Is that Drew Barrymore!?
Just awesome ❤
Loved it !!!!!!!!!!!💗💗💗
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3ePPA0yzSU&amp;t=174">2:54</a> A Anne desafinado nessa parte  torna o vídeo totalmente original!! Bela escolha dos dois não removerem essa parte.
This song and “Clover Cage - The Road to Awakening” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💝

love this
Oh Buddha! Her voice is truly inspirational. It&#39;s natural, the tone is pure, unique, free and there&#39;s playfulness in it, it&#39;s amazing to hear the material that makes up her sound. Feel and enjoy, I&#39;m addicted to it, my hand and mind can&#39;t stop clicking!
🤨😐If you live a life of sin,😅🧋🍾🗼🏣 lust, do not serve🛐 God, do not walk in his✝ commandments, you are blind and I am the one who is warning you to change direction so as not to fall into the abyss.🔥🦂 God does not force anyone to serve him, however when we do not serve God, we are automatically serving the evil one👺. Many will say: But I am honest, I do not steal, I am fair, etc. No one can pay their own price, only Jesus was able to pay the high price for all of us, so that whoever believes in him may not perish in the abyss, but have eternal life with God. Read the Bible!✝📚📗
The Voiceeee &lt;3 my god
anne marie is ur friends older sister that you wanna shag

I don’t even know much about her, but it’s crazy how many catchy hooks this song has. Every part is catchy enough to be a chorus. It’s quite impressive.
Childhood friends
