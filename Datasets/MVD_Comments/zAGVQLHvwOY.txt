ahhh es okay, I can be boring
A person who tends his/her mom should be respected. I know that this movie is not about this thing but it is a key component to his character.
They were not afraid to use blacks as evil guys...that is a new from Hollywood. For example the &quot;youth&quot; gang who robbed him was very diverse which is good...never seen anything like it before in big movies.
Looking like LOKI 😅
We are all jokers
health leader would be so proud of him I literally felt his presence in him 🤡❤️.
Thumbs up if you CONTINUE to come back for this Masterpiece of a Trailer in 2024!
i feel bad for arthur
Would love to see a follow up with the 3 Jokers; starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jim Carey, and James Franco.
Z alkoholikami oraz z narkomanami jeszcze pogadam! Artystę muzycznego, czyli producenta w polski samochód z silnikiem spalinowym i niech jego twarz będzie sławna oraz znana!
🤡
Terrible movie! One of the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. Another in a long list that adds no value to life. Total waste of time.
Jesus the bathroom dance…chills…he is an okay actor ha
lovely!
An incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix, hats off! 10/10!
joaqin phonix <br>actor ❌❌❌❌<br>ARTIST✔✔✔✔🗿🗿
Technically his first kill was self defense he just didn’t call the cops afterwards bc i mean.. look at him. They’d lock him up bc those guys were rich and “somebodies” Arthur is a nobody and us  nobodies are usually always blamed
Much deserved Oscar
I&#39;m here after the joker 2 valentine day look of joker and harley.
2024 and still one of the greatest trailers ever
Jokers are not laughing stock, they make everyone laugh, they live in people&#39;s hearts
This trailer gives me goosebumps!
I watch this movie whenever I feel like I&#39;m being too happy with my life
When is joker 2 trailer gon come out?
Best movie I&#39;ve seen in years!
This movie was actually a lot lighter and classic in tone than what I expected. I thought it would be a lot more wild and insane for being banned from certain theaters.
I am excited to watch part 2
YES
is so real...
Cant wait for joker 2
I watched this movie three times and I still cannot believe how great it is. And Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s acting is absolutely shockingly good. <br>Definitely one, if not THE greatest movie I ever watched
Painful movie...being abuse when he was a kid and then the hate of society😢😢😢

At the end of this show, i was actually rooting for joker all the way and crying with tears of joy when he actually did something significant. It felt alive.
This movie sucked. Not just saying that for YouTube... It really was boring and stupid. Nothing like the joker.
100 m 👏🏻
I just watched this movie for the first time and I kept waiting for that one thing to push him to his psychotic break and that didn&#39;t happen. His lines about his life not being a tragedy but a comedy really sum up his mental state throughout the movie. The way the world has treated him has been tragic for so long that now its comedic. Also the double meaning because a Shakespeare Comedy is a tragedy
I can’t believe that in 2019 I was so stuck on not seeing this movie, saying it seemed boring and lame.<br>After rewatching Suicide Squad I wanted to see some more DC movies, so I decided to finally watch this movie and it truly blew me away. The development, the story, everything was just perfect. I loved the plot twists and so many scenes left me like 😮 lmao. <br>If you have not watched this movie yet please do, it won’t be a waste of time whatsoever.
Most movies today are trash but this and probably Pearl recently have been total modern day classics.<br>Joker feels like a cult classic but they you remember just how successful it was and how much is grossed..Phoenix is a complete genius
Still get chills after rewatching this now over 10 times
Мне понравился трейлер
I remember the day this movie was released. The only movie in my life which i have watched twice in the cinema but still couldnt get enough of it. In my country &quot;Pakistan&quot; alot of people called it slow, boring and hard to understand but i cant comprehend in words what joy i felt after watching this movie. I was the only guy in the cinema hall who cheered when Arthur danced after killing those three guys, who felt bad when arthur was in pain and who felt relieved and clapped in the last scenes when Arthur was standing on the top of the car, accepting his destiny. That day i came home and my wife saw a very different side of me, because she couldnt understand why i was so connected to the movie...i cried and cried and cried that day because all that was in my past came back crashing in my mind...i was bullied all childhood and teenage. I never knew why being innocent and not hurting anyone was taken as symbol of weakness... this movie took out my vulnerabilities and washed them away which i had controlled over the years. Thank you Joaquin and Todd for bringing this gem to the world.
That&#39;s are my favourite one movie
My life is not a tragedy but a comedy
boring movie
2024, we still here 😮‍💨🔥. The best there ever will be!🫱🏼‍🫲🏻
HE IS JOKER BUT HE IS THE CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME

I finally got around to watching this time waster. Fell asleep 3 or 4 times, then it just ended.<br><br>I&#39;m not sitting/sleeping through this again. The tragedy is I bought this.<br>Whats the BFD about this movie??
A masterpiece and an instant classic finally on Netflix. Está bien bonita❤.

Baby bhaiya best joker 🃏
Joker takes the comic book character and makes him into a sad yet interesting person, lead by Joaquin Phoenix’s outstanding performance, engaging all the way through, and a dark tone with it.
The lines “All I have are negative thoughts.” “People are starting to notice.” and “Can you introduce me as Joker?” along with the music give me major goosebumps.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=1">0:01</a>
The story of Arthur Fleck, a person society failed in every possible way and his only escape was to relinquish his sanity.
He tried to be a hero now he&#39;s a villain -Joker
Legend
Anurag dobhal ki janta like thoko
The trailer captures the tensions of the movie.
My favorite movie ever 😭🥹
-Awesome character<br>-Outstanding actor<br>-Fantastic writing<br>-Brilliant art direction<br>-Tremendous tone<br>-Awesome musical score<br>-Great cinematography<br>-Masterpiece of a movie
Just been to Vancouver for the first time and ended up in a street packed with drug addicts.Looking like zombies, behaving,  acting  completely insane. I was thinking, this could be a scene from the joker movie. Conclusion, the movie is not so far from the truth. Despite the countries so called wealth so many people are beeing neglected, ignored because they are abusers. Not seen as ill. Shame on you responsibles !!!
The best film in the world. I hope it will be developed for the better

Take away the character archetype and this movie is an inspiring performance. The problem is, he&#39;s nothing like the Joker!

This is a cinematic masterpiece❤
The Gotham city is a modern New York,  with various thugs, Antifa-BLM goons, and the Joker ...is Biden. The dark  reality.
Best villain of all time
Anyone watching after seeing they’re making a second one?
The only movie that can be rated 11/10

So phenomenal 🔥
This is the another clown based on Stitches (Ross Noble)
Sitting in the dark theatre, watching this movie, for the first time in my life, I felt the theatre screen like a mirror, where I was watching myself and the society surrounding me

I never saw this movie because I haven&#39;t been 13 for quite some time, now.<br>Unlike, the executives that produced it.<br><br>Screwed that line up about the nobody&#39;s laughing now, part.<br>Hacked it from a British comedian who hacked it from an American.<br><br>Also, IT Chapter Two released the same year, as the YouTube is telling me in the suggestions (hello).<br>What does it all mean, Big Dan?

This is a perfect movie hard to impossible to find mistakes!
If you&#39;re not funny, you&#39;re not the real The Joker.<br><br>That&#39;s how you can tell.
Am i the only one who didn&#39;t like this movie
Joker 😂😂😂😂
I love😈😈😈😈
2023 but still watching the trailer 👍
Might be the best movie of all time
8-8-2023
His acting was so real that you could actually feel his pain through out his laugh
Had the privilege to experience this movie in theatre. Waiting for Joker 2.
who is the joker right now in DC Actual.
Only one word G.O.A.T
We need a new batman movie with THIS joker
Imagine if they intergrated this joker into the batman 2 or 3
Jai Shri ram
This is the worst movie I have ever seen
A real story a real charachter 👏👏👏
I remember i used To have a crush on the joker . Both Phoenix and heath
Maybe Abaddon, the counterpart of Satan could be thinking deep by now of the mistakes committed by Satan in his failed system and programs that if he do the same thing like what Satan does in slowing down everything like a turtle his version of system and program could be at risk for quick disposal for the garbage collectors to collect. That is if he can have the time and chance to formulate a program and system of his own if he can manage to beat Satan&#39;s forces, if not his locust army will be turned like locust insects and be eaten by the liquor drinkers who loves to eat locusts as &quot;pulutan &quot; in drinking sessions of the alcoholics synonymous.
Because of the slowness of the world system as computer based due to the delaying tactics, system slow phase, system designed to fool their minds like circulating system&#39;s idiots unable to reach a  particular goal due to &quot;paikot-ikot&quot; in Tagalog words, drama reality stage plays designed to attack and pull down, very slow broadband signals, too many procedures and bottlenecks in important activities, very slow mindset of Satan it&#39;s pioneer founder, the technology if it can speak in AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) form will be angry to Satan and cohorts because Satan designed World System technology to be slow like a turtle impedding world development and progress, technology was created to make things easier for the activities of humans and if technology system was meant to be slow then the technology system created by Satan was designed to be put into a garbage bag or garbage can for disposal. And the Joker the counterpart of Batman will laugh at them like Nya ha ha ha haaa!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Melhor  filme
And it’s Crazy To Think This Is Directed By The Same Guy Who Did the hangover movies
i can relate this movie to my core. I&#39;m a very sensitive person and people are so rude these days.
Personally i love this movie and phoenix is great actor, after heath ledger he is the best option for this role❤
Already an iconic film.
The greatest movie of all time
And then he became napoleon somehow 😂😂😂
100M trailer views. Fantastic trailer, legendary movie.
Mr Phoenix in a remake of the crow would be amazing❤❤❤
Whose here after 100 million🎉🎉🎉
I cant believe it Marvel or Dc <br>This is the only trailer hits 100million views <br><br>Wow ..................<br>People beyond LOVED THE Joker
The title jumpscared me
One of the best trailers for one of the best comic book films ever. Phoenix is on another level in this. Deserved his oscar. Can&#39;t wait for Part II And Gaga&#39;s Quinn,
🥱🥱😎😏😒😏😒🤨🤐
“ normal people expect people with mental illness to act like they don’t have one”
Movie sucked. Phoenix is a great actor. But this isnt joker or even close to joker. This was just bad
we gotta make this trailer Pass Godzilla versus Kong trailer!
I vividly remember working as a Security Guard in the cinema when this masterpiece was released. It was winter im the UK and the nights were getting longer. The cinema was around a 20 minute walk from my house so I would walk most days as it was convenient. The first time I saw Joker, I was genuinely petrified to walk home after work. Most of the location that the movie is filmed in resembles the route I would walk to and from work. Considering I was doing a 10 hour shift which started at 2pm till 12am it was a horrible walk home. This is from a 36 year old father of 3🤣
A ground breaking film in every regard.... however I can only see the next Joker film being a diminished version of this, particularly with Stefani Germanotta copying Joaquin Phoenix (because she was such a fanatic and wants to inhabit him for her own attention) the same thing she did when she was suppose to do a tribute to David Bowie at the brits, but made a complete mockery of it by making it about her 🙄. I can see this film being made around the Harley Quinn character and not the Joker and his other movie with Ridley Scott (Napoleon) being based around Vanessa Kirby&#39;s character rather than the actual movie. Such a shame that great directors, actors, editors and script writers have to allow this madness for the sake of the insane-woke agenda and woketards, this has already impeded on the quality and greatly impacts the integrity of the film.<br><br>Thank goodness we would still have this one, untainted!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Masterpiece
My life is similar😀
😮😮😮
😊😊😊
I love this film
I’m so glad that DC is taking a realistic approach and portraying it’s psychopaths. This is R rated, the Batman narrowly avoided an R rating, it’s so beautiful to see.
Estoy emocionado por la segunda película de este Joker
🔥🔥🔥🔥
What I find most interesting is Arthur, in a way, is an extremely empathetic character. He does horrible things, but he has a source of it: the disapproval from society. The $1 billion dollars was well-earned.
Greatest Drama Great &amp; pure artist academy winner hats off to Joaquin..Unbelievable art..Movie &amp; his acting shown human soul
I personally liked the so called teaser trailer better because the track that accompanies it is both brilliant and psychotic at the same time.
Those 100 million views really tell you how masterpiece this movie is.
Don&#39;t care what critics say, this film is a Masterpiece
One of the best movies I have ever seen
10/10! If you&#39;re considering watching this movie, DO IT.
Way better than bu$$yman. I mean Batman who too scared to spell blood
Man can&#39;t believe its been 4 years now, 2019 was a good year.
100 million views! Aw yeah boy!<br>Joker ain’t over! Popularity-wise.
Bro was saving dc back in 2019
Thriller 💖🌟🌟
Such a good movie
Let&#39;s go
It&#39;s the &quot;You don&#39;t listen do you?&quot;
best joket movie.. goodjob
This trailer has 100 million views…damn
You know a movie is awesome, when you came back to the trailer after watching it.
we&#39;re all jokers. outsiders and forsaken.
Anyone after 100 mil views?🎉🎉
If they had a batman for the new dcu to act with him it could be good.
Too disturbing tbh
❤❤❤
When you see me here in 2023 that’s mean it’s great movie makes me back to watch this great trailer again
Sometimes I watch this just to feel something. This is actual fire, always gives me chills.
👍👍👍
I am turn into Joker inside me.🤡🤡🤡
One of the greatest movies and performence&#39;s of all time<br>,,Don&#39;t Smile&quot;
This trailer music is a total masterpiece. Would give me goosebumps in person 😮

Masterpiece 🗿🐐

Arthur Fleck is the type of person I would be great friends with just because of how kind he and how he’s always trying to make people laugh. Maybe not when he’s stabbing people or shooting them in the face
Now 4 years ago well back in clowd in year
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=39">0:39</a> lMAO dEAD
Way to much running  lol
The acting is beyond anything I&#39;ve seen, Phoenix became The Joker
For me this movie doesn&#39;t teach a person to be violent instead, this movie shows how violence create and happens!
:)
this movie is about encounters violent thugs while wandering the streets of Gotham City dressed as a clown. Disregarded by society, Fleck beigns a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as Joker in director todd phillips thrilling origin story.
How I hope I can see it in the cinema again.....
❤
Got kiranpi gecirin lan
I think if they tried Josh Helman as the joker he would fit better being the character. He has the same facial expression and smile as the joker just like Heath Ledger.
A stupid script, a bad interpretation in a stupid movie
Who&#39;s here after seeing the set pics for Joker 2??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=99">1:39</a>
I still love this movie!!!!
The best villain ever
Merinding kalo udah berkaitan dengan joker dan batman
The best trailer I&#39;ve ever seen!
Besttttt
Watched this bc I just learned that he was also Commodus in The Gladiator. What an astounding actor!
My favorite trailer of all time
Netflix, i was born in the wrong generation. THIS is filmmaking!
Phoenix 💛🧡💛🧡
I cannot say how much this movie speaks to me.<br><br>Abuse, death, human scumbags taking advantage.<br><br>It is fantasy but I will always take Arthur&#39;s side as twisted as that may seem to some.
i remember getting out the cinema from watching this movie and think this is the best movie ever made
Let&#39;s go to 100 million views everyone 🗿
Its 2023 and I still can&#39;t get over this movie. The moments, the music, the dialogues... One of the best movies of the decade.
Impressive actor this movie should  be 10/10 on Imdb
A good movie
One of the worst takes on the Jokers.
I was gonna go to bed as i was very tired.I then shortly switched through a few channels on my TV and i saw that this Film was gonna start in a few mins,(at 00.15).I had no idea what it was about,but i thought,ah,lets have a look at it.<br>What a wonderful Film!,it had me rivetted,my tiredness totally disappeared.Brilliant acting from Joaquin!. 🤡👍 😃
This is one of the greatest movies of the 21st Century. Nail biting and submersive acting, an ankle deep plunge into the fragile mind. You can watch it as many times as you like, each time is almost like the 1st time. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix complimenting each other like cheese &amp; pickles.
Cool Joker 2 have Lady Gaga
Joaquin 10.<br><br>Heath 9.5.<br><br>Mark 8.5.<br><br>Cesar, Jack and Cameron 7.5.<br><br>Jared 5.5 (but not his fault).
The last 2 times an actor played this role they won an Oscar
This movie absolutely sucked. Why couldn&#39;t Joaquin Phoenix have died instead of Heath Ledger or his brother River. They would have made a way way better Joker undoubtedly
Thank you Todd for making the sequel possible i&#39;ve been waiting for this since 2019 🫡🤡 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freejoker">#FreeJoker</a>
This, the dark knight trilogy, The Batman and The Snyder cut gave me hope for DC<br><br>The hope is slowly diminishing
The color palette alone of this movie deserves an award.
Who&#39;s Here After Joker 2 Wrapped ?

It didn&#39;t felt like am watching a movie , it was like am looking at something real , seriously one of the best DC movies ever
I&#39;ve just came across this movie for the 5th time( on cable TV) and I&#39;m enjoying it like it&#39;s my first time watching.<br>What a masterpiece!
Turning it over to GOD
I am the joker now
At the same time
I&#39;ve got 2 mothers like yoyr 1
I actually have his condition, apart of my Schizoaffective Disorder. His laugh and the way he does it is the same as mine. Amazing performance 👏
For some reason not seen ill watch today
I always thought this joker was trying to emulate health legers joker.
This movie is so real and relatable it hits every aspect of how bad of joke our life is sometimes.
Best music

I keep watching this when I&#39;m down. It&#39;s good feeling

BROKE-N
Great movie
DC please just please when for the second movie, we don’t want no action no Batman vs Joker fight, no super powers no villains and no heroes, we just want Arthur Fleck.
Does anyone know if its possible to get hold of the trailer music on its own?
I did an experiment were I commented on facebook ..saying that i felt like doing what arthur did in the movie ..just to see how people who claim to care would react..<br>I can say no one is standing in my queue anymore..<br>To anyone who wants to fat check his circle ..do the same and then either watch them be by your side or watch them trying to get the worst out of you ..<br>It very saddening to see people trying to get the worst out of you ..but surprisingly its very peaceful as well ..
This was more than a movie. It was an experience. On par with Taxi Driver, Clock Work Orange &amp; One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest. Masterpiece
If you think you&#39;re defending people with mental illnesses by creating such a movie then you must be mistaken...😠😠😠<br>All what have you done is illustrating people with mental illness as being harmful to themselves and the society... Not all people with mental illness can be dangerous...

Best trailer ever !!!!!
This movie absolutely and truly changed my old life into a new one thanks to watching it once on my Samsung TV. I have seen it multiple times, and the more I watched it, the more thankful I was wishing my mom to be. Absolutely highly recommended to watch alone or with family members (don&#39;t ever watch it with either very young children or babies). 😉
2023
Who’s still comes back to this trailer
I&#39;m a late boomer. I only watched in now, Feb 2023. I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about it for two days. Moving performance.
Joaquin Phoenix was awesome. He is the most profound actor of this generation.
before pandemic coronavirus🥲
This movie will remain a masterpiece ❤️
$$$$$$$$$$$%%%%%%%%
Joachim is not a actor he is a God
Eow
Thanx to those comedians/jokers who made laugh in my childhood.
Joker Jr 🤡
Beetlejuice In real life
Plss give us a multiverse or a cameo of Willem dafoe as joker or as a clown
I have nothing else to lose. Nothing  can hurt me no more 😢. - joker 🃏
People say that woke culture destroyed cinema, but alpha male community, anti woke community with all these stupid analysis&#39;s is much worse
I got goosebumps in every scenes of this movie.😯😯😲
best part of the music - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=85">1:25</a>
Oh no no no, I don&#39;t tell the jokes, I just write them
His acting is sharp
Quite the trailer to this melancholy and dark story.<br>I was surprised they used the 1981 Warner Bros. logo in place of the 1993-2019 print logo at the end.
One of the best!!!!
0ne of the the most powerful  and best acted moments in this movie is when Arthur steals his mom&#39;sfile from the asylum and learns the truth of his abusive childhood. He reads the file while they cut to flashbacks and as he laughs uncontrollably, you feel so much pain and sadness just pouring out of him through the laughter. Truly remarkable performance and even his body language when he is running in a few  different scenes... he looks just like the old animated  joker running.
I’ve never related to a character like I do with Arthur. Doesn’t matter what you do right, they’ll always be people pulling you down
Almost a full hundred mill! And well-deserved at that.
I thought i will hate joker in this movies.
This is one of the best movie trailers I&#39;ve ever seen. The background music is dope
Never felt so epic, while sitting on a toilet.
The trailer, the teaser trailer was incredible, and the movie itself was outstanding...
marvel -avengers rule<br>Dc - le Joker
Joker is one of the most powerful, well made comic book movies of all time, Todd Philip’s created a masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix nailed the role of Joker 👏👏👏
Hehehe
they are going to ruin this character with a sequel
Went to the movies three times for this one❤️ That never happens. Anyway, great trailer, but the teaser was award-worthy!!
Best movie ever ngl

This movie is aging like wine..
This movie was great. I hope sequel would be at least not bad, would not try ruin original movie. Either way I will like this movie, and I&#39;m grateful that it was made as good as it is
From worst ❤️💞to the best 💟💜the jokers 🌍
I felt every bit of this Joker movie (R.I.P) Heath Ledger ... I felt every bit of this Joker movie it delved inside a place of sorrow etc.
&quot;For my whole life,<br>I didn&#39;t even know if I existed.<br><b>but I do.</b><br>And people, are starting, to notice.&quot;
This movie was great, this movie was an experience when I saw it in theaters I&#39;ve never felt so nervous and worried about a character in my life it absolutely deserved all the awards it got
100&#39;000th Comment.

As a Marvel fan . This tops my list of best superhero genre
this movie is forever a part of me
i think it&#39;s some kind of  bank heist movie, with classic action scenes. Instead, i&#39;m sure there&#39;s a physiological &#39;thriller&#39; that now no longer effectively questions our society but also delves into pretty much every  area. the film almost perfectly depicts the character&#39;s natural transformation from arthur to joker, in which the target market is confronted with the reality that this change is caused by society. we do not support arthur but we sympathize with him, he gives you one of the highest quality performances i&#39;ve ever seen, the movie is entirely based on its ability to draw on the wide range of emotions and research that arthur is going through, even while conveying the experience, feeling. i don&#39;t feel the joker is a villain at all.
I love this movie as much as the next guy but I personally know people who took this movie waay waaay too seriously.<br><br>Arthur fleck is a great character for sure but he&#39;s definitely not to be idolised.
8m 0
what an actor... really i don&#39;t know if Joaquin is a depressed guy or he was, but you can perceive the mental illness of Arthur in every scene, every little movement or gesture, is if he really it wouldn&#39;t acting, the oscar was totally deserved. I really feel a connection with the character, i suffer of depression and, wow, how he feel his life... sometimes you feel that the world is so hostile... really amazing film, best joker of all times, 2nd for Ledger&#39;s joker.
My name : Luige Laroya.  Joker HaHaHaHa
Joker hahaha
Looking forward to the next one since it&#39;s been confirmed
RIP the real joker (heath ledger) the film JOKER was awful
CHILLXZ
Great movie. Joaquin really did a good job portraying Epic Lloyd!
Is it amusing movie 🍿 ?
I&#39;ve consistently said that This is the best Trailer for a movie I&#39;ve ever seen, It foreshadows a bit but also after watching the film, it makes the trailer just that much more thrilling!!!!
<b>99M</b>
Masterpiece 10/10
Major props to JAOQEN PHEONIX for doing the HEATH LEDGER version. Canonical to the original DARK NIGHT he was in.
When he says &quot;All have a negative thoughts&quot;...when nobody listens to you... dipression happen
what if a movie about joker who is hero of slums and poor people who are never get equally share in life than rich people  ?
Such an amazing movie so original. Especially if you have depression diagnosed like me. Loved river phoenix so sorry for loss but it shows what a solid actor Joaquin phoenix is. Also solid person
He’s literally me fr
Here till the trailer reaches 100 million views!!!
Every once in a while comes a movie, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin&#39;s performance and cinematography in all it&#39;s brilliance. Grotesque, haunting, and cringy. It&#39;s really hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won&#39;t blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time. <br>this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie- it&#39;s a proper psychological Thriller/Drama, with the single best character development that I have ever seen. Final Verdict: an Outstanding Movie with a haunting performance and best character development I&#39;ve ever seen.
Me and Arthur have something in common
Why did you include the prolific peodophile gary glitter tune in the film when you could have used anyone else you fkn sick nonse twunts.
Truly one of the movies of all time
Who’s ready for Joker 2?!
Oh god the nostalgia that I feel
he wants me fr
why do i want him<br><br>🙃
A good sequel idea to this would be a movie about Viktor Zsasz.
Can&#39;t help to compare Murray (De Niro) to Jimmy Kimmel.
A masterpiece🙌🏻
Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m the only one coming back to watch this masterpiece

Honestly, I think this movie nails what it would be like to be mentally insane, and I haven’t even watched it yet
The joker should be about a man who never does the same joke twice who is trapped by a mimic.
‘All I have are negative thoughts’. I guess pretty much the state of mind of one Jeffrey Dahmer.
Best actor
Great movie

Masterpiece
Next level acting by Joaquin Phoenix Can&#39;t wait for Joker 2 (4.10.24)
Man! This trailer makes the movie look so good!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>It was not lying 😀👍
The 2019 film Joker is about the Joker’s beginnings, how Arthur Fleck developed into his Joker persona. Unlike other portrayals which focus primarily on the violent, murderous criminal that is the Joker, this film is focused more on the mental illness and the effects of society that drove Arthur Fleck to embrace his new identity. This film contains violence but it is violence that it essential to the plot line, thus making the film balanced. According to Infinite Bandwidth by Dr. Eugene Gan, “without balance, without a willingness to look at media from every possible angle, we can’t possibly form right judgements” (22). With the previous quotation in mind, we realize that Joker uses violence to allow the audience to understand just how sick Arthur Fleck is, the movie gives a whole new perspective, even providing a feeling of catharsis for the main character. In the movie, the Joker asks,“What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you f****n’ deserve!”. This quote makes the audience aware of their own attitude towards mental illness and may inspire reflection on how it is often handled it in our society. A quote from when Arthur is talking to his therapist describes the truth about how so many people who struggle with mental illness may feel: “You don’t listen, do you? You just ask the same question every week...’Are you having any negative thoughts?’ All I have are negative thoughts”. The thought provoking and psychologically thrilling storyline is a skillfully developed way of portraying someone we would typically label a villain, there are both heart-racing action scenes as well as deep topics to later be talked about. Motivated by the shared experience of loneliness, isolation, and a feeling of being misunderstood, Joker pushes audiences to consider the human dignity of all people: &quot;For My Whole Life, I Didn&#39;t Know If I Even Really Existed. But I Do And People Are Starting To Notice”, we can all relate to the feeling that nobody knows we exist.  There are many quotes and phrases throughout the movie that inspire introspection and reflection, so the film is more than pure entertainment. Although he is ultimately a criminal, there are so many aspects of the Joker that we can sympathize with and relate to, as we are all a part of the human race.
I saw this movie so many times that I still can&#39;t stop watching the trailer
Remember when this came out and people seriously thought there was going to be a mass shooting at a screening
Everyone has the Joker inside...some are just better at repressing it. In this ever chaotic world, any set of circumstances can force a &quot;normal&quot; human being to go completely insane.
❤👌😘👌👌🥹😢💔💔
When we think about craziness... &#39;normal people&quot; are actually the crazy one... normal people lives in fantasy, normal people see wars and cruelty as something far away.. they think the world is alright.... when in fact the world is not alright.... the world is terrifying the more we realized... so Joker is only reacting to the fact that the world is cruel... He sees the truth... how could he possibly just keep silent when he is so hurt
I like only one character in dc thatt is joker
what&#39;s up with all the comments on this trailer getting thousands of likes.<br><br><br><br>Let&#39;s try it, shall we?<br>🤡
I struggle with mental illness, not to the extent of Arthur but gawd damn I relate to him sm
Jokernya, Kurt Cobain aja atau Jared Leto aja, gimana ? 🃏
When this movie came out I didn&#39;t understand the need for another Joker, but my goodness this is another side that I think more people can relate to. He did a beautiful job.
One of my biggest regrets in life is not watching this in cinema
Both joaquin and robert killed the roles!!

I watched this movie and I must say it&#39;s an alright movie. Joker is like a crazy guy to everyone cause of his laughing condition. In the end was chaotic. He ended up taking the city.
movie part 2 comming plz i am tamil i am joker big Fan plz please
A musical sequel, titled Joker: Folie à Deux (transl. &quot;Madness for Two&quot;), is scheduled to be released on October 4, 2024, with Phillips and Phoenix returning.
I can’t tell who did it better; heath ledger or Joaquin phoenix
This is me ....
No, this one&#39;s &quot;The Joaquer&quot;
Wow! Ok you guys all just made me want to watch this movie 🍿 🤩🤩🤩
After watching this movie i can hope DC to make a scarecrow movie
This trailer is giving nostalgia now ❤️‍🔥superb best film💖
The Joker story
<b>The fact that the Joker is one of the most vicious villains in history, but has so many origins and could be anyone, whether it&#39;s Jack Napier or Arthur Fleck, is incredible. He is charismatic, flamboyant and frighteningly sadistic. Joaquin Phoenix made the most realistic version of the character. I dare say I find him more amazing than Pattinson&#39;s Batman.</b>
Movies show how far the evil west has progressed
this movie is an absolutely astonishing masterpiece
Watched it last night. Can definitely see why incels and members of r/conspiracy love it so much. Was a cringe film. Joaquin has fingers that look like little slimy penises.
The Joker role is a cursed role IMO. Most actors who take the role find it too hard to bear. The Character is just too dark.
Did you know that in order to play the role of an insane and mentally depressed person, Joaquim Phoenix <b>played GTA Online for one day straight?</b>
They made him to old for the timeline. Should have used a younger actor

I watched this movie one time since it came out and I loved it so much I was afraid not to have the same feeling I had the first time I watched it. This trailer made me be brave enough to watch it again
I get so nostalgic from this already LMAO like this was such a nice film
“Let’s put a smile on that face!” <br><br>– The Joker

Awesome trailer.
Is it just me? I watched this on the cinema the day it came out then i&#39;m still here watching the 2 trailer of this movie. The movie and the trailer is masterpiece.
The sequel will flop so bad...<br>What the in God&#39;s name are you doing, DC ?<br>This movie never needed a second one... Choosing money over reputation in the industry, best guess
Watched this today on Netflix, I&#39;ve never seen this type of art before. The vision of a broken, evil soul..
&quot;Nobody is civil any more&quot;. Dark and ominous. My Hero.  Better than any stupid superhero batman movie. I see no evil in Arthur at all.  Phoenix would deserve the Oscar for his brilliant performance.
Who here after they are making a joker 2.
The best Joker that ever existed
this was the last movie I saw in theaters
“It&#39;s all a joke! Everything anybody ever valued or struggled for, it&#39;s all a monstrous, demented gag! So why can&#39;t you see the funny side? Why, aren&#39;t you laughing!”<br><br>-The Joker
this movie absolutely ruined the word society for me
Bros so good at acting 💀
🦇 Seriously WB, Please consider releasing Batgirl 🦇<br>Some of us really want to see it!
Imagine Cristian bale and Phoenix in a dark violent scary rated R movie that&#39;s packed full with emotion. Joker is my all time favorite movie.
This is a great trailer! Damn
I find it terrifying how this movie wouldn’t have been made under the Discovery merger.
Or legena 🏟
The King of Comedy + Taxi Driver<br><br>that’s why De Niro was in it.
Just finished watching this and couldn&#39;t wait for it to end.<br>Totally sucked. Terrible movie!!!!!!!!!
2020, 2021 and 2022. Just for the sake of a how good a trailer can be, I keep coming back here. I shall be here next year as well.
a classic
I like it when the Joker said &quot;It&#39;s jokin&#39; time&quot; and jokin&#39; all over his enemies

2 years ago and this movie still masterpiece
Honestly I didn&#39;t really get this movie? Why is it so popular
why is the trailer music better than the movie soundtrack lmao
Oscars deserved a Joaquin and he got it
literally me
From Gladiator to thiis joaquin is something
One of the best movies
Masterpise
&#39;Well nobody is laughing now&#39; is such an underrated joke.. Brilliant
Kindly send me the link of this movie
&quot;For my whole life I didn&#39;t know if I even really existed, but I do and people are starting to notice.&quot; That&#39;s such a powerful line.
So is there part 2?
Although, &#39; J &#39;, is a well-made film, I don&#39;t know if I can actually recommend it, for the simple reason that it is just so sad and depressing.<br>On a side note: I have read that some people are not clear when exactly this movie is supposed to take place.<br>Here is a clue:<br>There is a shot of a movie theater marquee with the title: &#39; Blow Out &#39;.<br>That film, starring John Travolta, and directed by Brian De Palma, was released in 1981.
One of my favorite movies of all time. 10/10 🍿 🎞
brilliant movie!!
I’m saying this and I’m saying right now Joaquin should be the purple man in the next fandom movie or I sware to god!

Why joker is a success and other dc films are not is because joker is the most relatable character to real life ever in a superhero film
He the hero which todays society deserves.....
Sort of wonder why this was so successful. Even my coworkers wanted to see this badly, even tho they hate superhero movies. Maybe it&#39;s relatable bc most people are mentally ill
See it in IMAX and dolby cinema 10.4.19
joker is the best
!
Lady Gaga yesssza!!
Boa atuação do ator. Resgatando o personagem de volta
Joaquin&#39;s best performance imo. I find it difficult to express how good this movie is. Joaquin Phoenix is one of my all time favorite actors.

Heath ledger set the bar so high... This Joker looks like a fool clown trying to act like adults.. Very Fake.. Horrible
This trailer is a masterpiece, I love how uneasy and chilling the music is, very much captures the eerie feeling the movie holds.
i dont watch movies twice...but ill always remember this one
Who else remember this masterpiece movie in 2022?
‘Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there’ - I wonder and respect same time the director to write this masterpiece scene and the things he went through to get that 🙂. Everyone deserves to be happy in this world 🌍 ❤️
This movie trailer is still one of the best ever made and the movie was awesome.
This isn&#39;t just a  DC movie. It is a masterpiece. As a DC fan, I am so proud that the Joker movie made more sense than the Justice League and other DC movies.
The story itself is good and sad but relating to it made it much more intense and yeah it&#39;s a very creative and grounded take on the joker which I like more than a vat of acid
marvel could never.
2 years later, and this movie is still a masterpiece.
Who else still watch this masterpiece?
Damn!
is it weird that i kept smelling cigarettes in every scene where Arthur smokes?
This trailer looks great 😊
I only see Johnny Cash 💀
Best movie for ever 👏🔥🔥

This movie is just pretty look at. That’s it. There is nothing else that makes me want to go see this movie.
Best movie of all time
3 years later - still gives me goosebumps ...
This movie is a masterpiece.
He just wanted to make people laugh
The trailer for this was so well done.
The trailer is better than the film. All the film is is him waling about laughing.
if he say this is his favorite movie 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
This is a masterpiece
Masterpiece!
There is no one evil , the time makes them evil
There is some reason to became evil and villan
the trailer did not do it justice......this was the best movie ive seen in a very long time
I&#39;ll never watch Batman the same again
Never thought I&#39;d feel sorry for Joker.<br>It takes true talent to make you sympathize with the villain while showcasing how bad he is.
Sometimes when I’m bored I come to watch this masterpiece of a trailer
He went crazy cause society abused him. So he decided to abuse society instead.
The acting was so good that I had to fast forward some of the really awkward acting sections... then I went back and realised that I NEEDED to watch. the reason it felt so awkward was because I was supposed to feel that way. Incredible acting!
awer
Utrrfg
This was a god tier trailer I actually love it
This joker was raw and more mentally Ill than the other ones and they actually went into depth more about him and his life in this movie, A MASTERPIECE
Mình gét găng tay
That woman is actually so dumb tho &quot;will you please stop bothering my kid&quot; oh yes, a common sign of being bothered is being happy, smiling, and laughing having fun. Judgemental bi.tch
I just watched it on netflix tdy. And Wow Wow Wow! One the best movie i ever watched. Joaquin Phoenix such a talented actor.
Best movie character of all time
xem video tôi thấy có mấy cái mẹo mấy video trước có rồi
“You Just Ask The Same Questions Every Week. &#39;How&#39;s Your Job?&#39; &#39;Are You Having Any Negative Thoughts?&#39; All I Have Are Negative Thoughts.&quot;<br><br><br>powerful dialogues
Man I remember when the trailer and showed my brother it and he said it was going to be bad. He laughed at me but nobody is laughing now. 3 years later, still probs one of my fav movies.
I forgot to punch out” 💥😂😂

Seen it hundreds of times, best movie
Wen 100 millions views 👀
so i was watching on Netflix &quot;Joker&quot; yesturday here in the UK, it the first time i watched this movie in this version of gotham city batman style, this was a film released in 2019 (maybe recorded parts in 2018) and something that caught my eye, this is a weird one about  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=2733">45:33</a> - during the streets in new york at the newsstand near the video game arcade shop, there is a poster of latest news of the murders on the loose mag and below the clown picture on mag it says: Exclusive photos of Disasters in Ukraine, what, this was 2019 movie not 2022 was this movie a coincidences about Ukraine or Mandela as im thinking as this is the first time i watched this film on Netflix was there anyone else seen a different story in the cinema  or on your physical discs. let me know, what ever way this made me felt a bit cold. and strange.
Hands down the scattiest film I&#39;ve ever seen.
It&#39;s actually quite a sad film.<br><br>Arthur was someone who never knew what acceptance or happiness was and never felt like he truly fitted in either.<br><br>Essential the movie is about him rebelling against a world he just wanted to be a part of but never had any room for him 🙄
I hate it
This happened to my buddy Eric

I didn’t know if I even really existed. But I do , peapol are starting to notice .. 🥶
This Movie somehow shows Socialism
Who’s here after joker 2 announced
I was enthralled by this film. It was a great origin story.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=128">2:08</a>
It&#39;s been 2 years since this movie premiered and Joaquin&#39;s performance makes me chill. He really deserved that Oscar for Best Actor.
any one heath ledger fans
I cannot believe how much he&#39;s aged! He is the same age as me, but somehow looks a lot older.
Joker: Hahahaha...<br>Lady: What&#39;s so funny?<br>Joker: Just thinking of a joke!<br>Lady: Do you want to tell me?<br>Joker: You wouldn&#39;t get it!<br>The Joke is-(This society created me-an evil a villain. I m sure the same society will create the opposite of me too one day.And a day will come where I have to face him or should I say He will meet his other half because bottom line is we are the coincide of the same the coin)<br>Camera zooms out with young Bruce Wayne with dead parents on the alley.
Return me my legions
Heath ledger would be proud
Unlike other joker characters this character is gonna be less dark while the actor as for me he was born for this.
Here in 2022, re-watching it. And waiting for part 2.

Well i had a thought <br>What do you think of jim carrey playing this same role. World would have seen his dark side
Joker Is Sooooo Funny
Marvel is for kids....<br>DC is for men..........
This is a very mean, cruel and nasty world. Look what humans have done to this world. They don&#39;t deserve this world.

Outstanding 🎥
all the time I thought this was a Batman movie.<br>Checked out the trailer after JP mentioned it on JRE
This could of been the joker for the new batman but whatever. Wasted potential
The Batman is good but JOKER is the best movie of the recent years
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=125">2:05</a>
did all of you guys who watched the trailers went to the movie or not ? if not please go watch the movie multiple times it was great so we can have a sequel .
Good movie
divided by borders united by joker!!🤡
This was everything i ever wanted and more. It went beyond the wildest of my expectations.
I see robert di niro and oh how he played taxi driver so much better that inspired joker.
According to Aristotle he is a complete tragic hero
Was reading the comments <br><br>And I found every o r has a Joker living inside them !!<br><br>🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I am Vengeance !
so good
This man is the Best Joker in my opinion
One the best moves I have ever seen a master piece
Can anyone say this is a fictional  supervillain origin story?? Can&#39;t even think cause this is so much realistic..great work dc , wrnr brs
Just watched this movie for the first time and I regret not having seen it 2 years earlier
One of the best films ever made.
Is it weird I like this film more than every other Batman movie?
مشتی
Masterpiece
o último filme bom lançado nesse tempo sdds
well our dictator decided that joker and a whole lot more content is not to be viewed by any Canadian because he is a woke snow flake that wants to control Canadians and how they think how they view the world by banning freedom of speech and freedom itself Canada is not the wonderful country it once was
Really nice movie
One of the most incredible performances I have ever seen. I cried and cried while the Joker laughed. Astonishingly written and beautifully directed. The Oscar was well earned and the speech made me cry again. Thank you Joaquin.
how did todd make the hangover and then this masterpiece

he&#39;s coming back
I just wish I knew if this was real or not
Everyone saying Arthur’s mother wasn’t his real mother is kinda missing the point of his shock and feelings of betrayal. He was upset upon realizing the extent of his childhood abuse and how poorly she cared for him. Him being adopted wasn’t necessarily the issue. A mother who has adopted a child isn’t any less legitimate than a mother who gives birth. And there’s also an aspect of being unable to tell whether the document is fabricated or not. Because it seems weird that they would allow a person like her to adopt a child when she has a history of mental disorders and poor finances.
LEX Luther or The Joker? 🤯🤯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 classic
Phoenix have portrayed joker perfectly but Ledger was the joker
One of the greatest movies of all time next to fight club.
Pennywise (It) (2017) Version The Joker 🤡🃏.
Yeah marvel got some movies<br><br>BUT THIS ONE is simply untouchable⚡️⚡️
For the people saying it doesn’t deserve an oscar are the people who never been thru anything in life at all! Which is fine! But this movie relates to society and everyday challenges! He lost his job, gotten beat up multiple of times, embarrassed on tv which he had dreams into becoming a comedian! The stuff with his mom bro had alot going on had things just would go his way! Murray is a perfect example of who people are in society he picked in him on tv and invited him to make fun of him on national tv! But it went left thats why i will always remain humble i took alot from this movie and it gotten a grammy for a reason obviously the voters can relate
Lol I want a sequel but I don&#39;t cause this is just a masterpiece
this trailer still feels like a garbage just like the movie
Best movie of the decade, century, all time ❤️
Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix making it harder for future actors to play Joker. The only one who will and should be able to play is Willem Dafoe

I see many movies but what stands out about joker is that it kept me 100% engaged. I loved the psychological angle and the effort Phoenix puts in for the cast ! Thanx for a phenomenal work
This happened to my buddy Eric
‘Do you Think this is funny’ Yea of course it is so funny when a clown Bang on your dooor!!,!! (For joke it is actually not funny)
Imagine we live in the world where daniel day lewis playing the joker
I always wonder what the scene  at 1.15 was supposed to be with Arthur in that suit and tie.
One of the few movies which truly represents how people treat each other in nyc. Also I find it hilarious that the period of the Joker movie is the same as for the movie Taxi driver, where Deniro also played a major role.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=95">1:35</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=130">2:10</a> goosebumps guaranteed 💯 oh my gosh that was awesome. Joaquin phoenix performance was very real you know. I haven&#39;t cried for a villan but for the first time after watching the climax of the Joker I cried a lot. It&#39;s a hard hitting movie. Loved it man ❤️
Anyone back here after the announcement of Joker 2
Masterpiece. There isn&#39;t too many good movies nowadays and then this came up.
Still doesn’t replace heath ledger tho
When he needed hugs nobody gave it to him<br>When he needed love nobody gave it  to him <br>When needed respect nobody respected him<br>When he needed friends nobody became <br>But when he became joker because of everyone then why he was called mad  and evil ???💔🥺😭<br>He is my inspiration , he is my hero

In the last 2 years, I haven&#39;t seen a movie up to this level.
Terrible movie. Ridiculous and distorted social commentary.
Can you introduce me as Joker?
All I have, are negative thoughts
&quot;The King of Comedy&quot; is not a tale of one man’s humiliation, but a bigger story about the nihilistic dead ends of fans’ celebrity worship and the culture that cultivates it. <br><br>&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is not the story of a hero, but of a madman who fancies himself a hero. And both hang the people who idolize them out to dry.<br><br>&quot;Joker&quot; is by mashing the two together in one tale — and removing most of their films’ humor and irony — a movie wrapping the Bickle/Pupkin avatar into the skin of the Joker, an icon of chaos who’s become a meme for the internet’s angry-man elements on the fringe and yielded a healthy dose of rancid anger. It’s hard to really do with Fleck what The King of Comedy did with Pupkin when the Joker’s biggest fans veer awfully close to a Pupkin type with Bickle-like aspirations.<br><br>Sadly for Fleck and his eventual Joker evolution, the resulting character is just a pathetic victim, and we know what we’re supposed to feel for him: pity. That’s signaled throughout the movie, loud and clear. He is beaten up, abandoned, mocked, and mistaken.<br><br>Unlike Bickle and Pupkin, when Fleck finally finds himself through violence, it reads unequivocally as a moment of self-actualization. He did it, guys. He finally overcame his oppressors and came into his own. Sure, you can condemn his actions. But then, aren’t you the bad guy?<br><br><br>This article put words on how I felt about Joker. Why it doesn&#39;t work for me. It feels more like an imitation of two supperior movies. <br>Joaquin Phoenix still one of the greatest actors tho. Commudus - one of the best villains oof all time. And also his depiction of Freddie Quell

this... is... so... epic!
Insanity just reached another level...!
Mental health is the most over rated thing of this century.
Sometimes I feel alone I want this 🥺🔥🔥
This is not a movie it&#39;s a lesson
this trailer gives me goosebumps
My one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,&quot;I used to think that my life is a TRAGEDY but now i realise that it is nothing but COMEDY&quot;....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it&#39;s theme being &#39;TRAGEDY=COMEDY&#39;...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to of or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!
Joker actually addressed so many serious societal issues
its basically Taxi Driver meets The King of Comedy
I think this might make a bunch of people think Penny Fleck is the main antagonist for driving the plot and being the reason why Arthur Fleck became the villainous Joker he is today. She’s more one of the two main antagonists (alongside Thomas Wayne) mainly because her overall abuse with Arthur truly created a movie and in the other hand Thomas Wayne antagonize Arthur Fleck and was much more of a obstacle to him.
Who can play the joker in 10 years now after Joaquin Phoenix ? If I was a producer i wouldn’t take the risk and do that movie .. just saying 🤷🏻‍♀️

I wasted 2 hours and mobile internet on this movie
Has to be the best trailer for a movie I’ve ever seen. Mr. Phoenix needs an Oscar if he didn’t win one already.
I love this man THE JOCKER his a legend 🤍
Its so oddly realistic, the way he talks when he trys to be normal is that of a naive person, but when he is being serious, he forms concise and logical sentences. He makes points clearly and understands what is going on like when he said &quot;all I have are negative thoughts&quot;
Why heroes fight the villains to save the smutty universe which deserve to be annihilated ?! So they are the real villains
Bad movie
Parasite rob this movie but they didn’t rob the Joker
Joker is the best comic book character.
10/10, brilliant movie!!!

Hey warner bros... Can u make joker 2..the movies that show joker true madness.. Rated R... Joker vs all bad guy.. Now that will be a badass movie..
What Joker did was right. Murray made fun of him using his clip &amp; later invited him on his show to mock him once again. <br>  - coming from Dark Knight
I couldn’t get into this or even finish this movie 3 years ago because I was in such a bad place I couldn’t digest anymore sadness <br>But now that I can understand what it was about <br>I can appreciate a beautiful piece of art of a movie it is
I personally think that every Batman villain deserves this kind of treatment
Great acting. I grow sympathy and love to joker.
This is the best dc movie of all time
Best movie ever made and I haven’t even seen it yet!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=691">11:31</a> I am not good at anything … except loving you.
Marvel gives good inspiration to dreamers. But every dreamer must one day wake up from that dream and face reality. DC welcomes you if you are ready to get rid of that childish mentality and face reality.
Joker🤡🤡
This movie is fantastic. Among all the garbage that comes out of Hollywood, it was highly refreshing.
noone can do lik heath so reactionn
Something about the idea of this movie, portrayed in the trailer when it first aired, was not interesting in the least. However, I recently watched We Own The Night, and something about Joaquin Phoenix&#39; approach to his craft (communicated by him and his cast mates) made me more intrigued. I&#39;m drawn to the darker side of entertainment (movies, music, photography) and that&#39;s what kind of changed my mind.<br><br>I just finished watching Joker. I almost stopped it/quit watching, an hour in. I got done, and looked at the total time of the movie and thought - &quot;There&#39;s 2 hours I&#39;ll never get back.&quot; <br><br>Joaquin&#39;s performance was definitely noteworthy. I think I had hoped/expected something else. I kept waiting for something to &quot;happen&quot; but it never really did. Probably one of the &quot;slowest&quot; movies I&#39;ve watched in quite a long time.<br><br>Visually, the movie was fantastic. The tones were on point for the time it was intended to have been shot in. Some of the locations, and how/when they were shot were amazing, like the stairs, or when he walks through the archway of his apartment, at night, through the rain. The close ups of his face in vehicles were incredible, especially when he&#39;s in the police car and the reflection of chaos is evident, but not in focus.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;d have to watch it a couple more times to gain a better appreciation, but, man, that could be like watching paint dry.
this is not okay you need harley quinn get it right
who watching on 2021?
Every poopoo time is peepee time. But not all peepee time is poopoo time.  -Joker

So sad this movie. Mental health is real.
This movie was just incredible, the acting felt so real and you really feel bad for Arthur. 10/10
Joker from batman is d only real joker !

I really hope the batman and this joker will related. And my biggest hope is it will lead into Batman Who Laughs aka Multiverse
One only DC movie which as more hyper and fans after batman 🔥💯❤🃏
The master piece😘
My tears fall when I watch this movie, because what is happening to our society now is the same as this movie.
Amazing

When I first saw this movie I hated it.<br><br>Because it hit too hard
&quot;All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. Thats how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.&quot;<br>- Joker
Joker 2 y otra vez DC vuelve al juego 🔥🔥
This, the new Batman film, and Suicide Squad 2021 are a new age of DC films. No more dark but lowkey wanna be marvel films, at this point, it&#39;s either its dark or totally hilarious. <br><br>ZSJL found the balance between the dark and lighter sides, but thats it. Unfortunately WW1984 sucked. Other than that, they should follow Zack Snyder&#39;s footsteps.
This movie was almost a premonition of the mask wearing and civil unrest to come in the COVID years.....<br>🤪🤡🤡🤡🤡
LAUGH WITH MANY , BUT DONT TRUST WITH ANY
It&#39;s getting dark out there.
This was 10x better than first trailer.
2021 and still watching this trailer, Joaquin deserved that Oscar he got, such an amazing actor 👌
send in the clowns...there should be clowns
do a sequel please!
As children we Love hero&#39;s and as adults we understood villen
I love joker
You are Still living in il paggliacci opera isnt? This is another version freak
I thought this movie have related to the batman (2022) by robert pattinson
This movie is masterpiece!
One of the best films of all time. Thank you actors and directors!
Oh wow they did do a remake of Falling Down
We are nearing 100 million views!!
Wow! I struggled with this movie if I&#39;m honest. I watched it over 3 days. Spoilers.... It begins like any serial killer movie, with the perp ( or victim depending on your point of view) spiralling toward violence due to his past. Paranoia, schizophrenia and delusion. there are a few  clues that tell us this us part  of  the DC universe along the way. It is in the final reel that this comes alive. Everything up to now finally makes sense as we begin to recognise the psychopath that is the Joker. To say i was blown away was an understatement. Marvel have done nothing that rivals the final 20 minutes of intense drama this movie gives as its finale. Oh. We also meet Batman. Just not in the way you expect it. Wonderful, simply wonderful.
&quot;Can you please stop entertaining my kid on this boring busride!&quot; Who is the real villain here?
Who&#39;s watching the trailer in 10/2021

This was a filming masterpiece, that a genre never knew it could produce. 10/10/10
When he wanted to cry a laugh emerged out instead what I love is in this is how he was formed into the villain because of everyone else not the opposite fun fact Heath ledger was such a good actor and played joker so well some of the crew were a bit nervous to film him
What a film , 5 stars, anyone that knocks this film is a moron

The world praising Joker in 2019. But, Ram directed &quot;Kattradhu Tamizh&quot; with a similar plot in 2007.
Best of drama movie ever i hope to continue to new parts

Three Years of JOKER❤️..Anyone watching this in the Lockdown !?
Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur/Joker is unparalleled.  The actor set a sky-high standard.  Hats off!  ❤️🎩❤️<br><br>Who else agrees⁉️
Happy 2 year anniversary.
There is a joker in everyone of us.
When you realize It’s the 3 year anniversary since Joker came out, <br><br>I always thought my life was a tragedy now I realize it’s a comedy 🤡<br><br><br><br><br>2 more years to go  🤡🃏
This movie will age better than any since Enemy of the State.
OVER RATED
The devil in I by slipknot is truly the perfect song for this film<br><br><br>Well at least the first few words ....&quot;undo these chains&quot;...sort of meaning of u let me show u my real emotions as oppose to putting on a face of normalcy u&#39;ll see all the bottled of anger due to him being disregarded by society and ridiculed.....<br>So when u hear &quot;undo these chains and ill so u my rage&quot;....its basically &quot;let me show u what society has made me&quot;....my anger had ben built up from yrs of being ignored(disregarded) and ridiculed and taken for granted

Im using this trailer as an example for my Philosophy class

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY&amp;t=136">2:16</a> send in the clowns
One of the best movies. I have ever watched!
This reminds me of that time my buddy Eric and I visited gotham for my friend Lukes wedding. Crazy week I tell ya
Nothing short of a master piece
Fav laugh
I like how a villan didn&#39;t get super natural powers but instead lost his mind.
This movie is so simple yet so complex. The underlying story and acting are top notch. One of rare modern movies in my opinion that are one of a kind gem.
Wow I just watched it and it was amazing I felt so sorry for him and loads of people can relate to him it was a great film!
&quot;I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it&#39;s a comedy&quot;
Best movie made
This trailer is an art. Just like the film. The ending while he was getting ready for the show was epic
Fav movie💯
If he didn’t get a Oscar we would riot we will werewolf and go wild.
Who knew that the Joker would be more relatable than Batman. The way  they took a supervillain and made him an absolute hero. Read &quot;masterpiece&quot; in the comment before watching it and I couldn&#39;t agree more...message: Be nice to others, you don&#39;t know the discomfort of the shoes they walk in.
This is the best movie of Joker yet nothing else and nobody could imitate Phoenix he&#39;s the best God blessing God bless you to finish we don&#39;t need no second Parts cuz this did it second part won&#39;t spoil it glad to ending 2 years and I keep looking at it everyday everyday once I get home here I go in and never get tired of it because I&#39;m speechless for work I&#39;m proud of you finished volume movies and this is the best one yet how do you put all your movies over and over and over by the way God bless you and your wife I&#39;m so glad for you congratulations you found love and she&#39;s so beautiful inside and out I think I seen her with a baby thank you ask if you had a baby already I seen how it would have Babies R Us congratulations I love you
The amount of times I&#39;ve come back just to watch the trailer - true masterpiece.
Police:-why you are so brutal<br>Joker:-Thanks to my society 🤡
I’m scared to see the condiment king in this universe
this movie makes me miss 2019
Joaquin Phoenix you are phenomenal
