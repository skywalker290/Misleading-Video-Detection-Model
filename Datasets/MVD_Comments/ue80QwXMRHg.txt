It all began here
Hope Thor can have this level of plot with a bit of a darker tone.
Six years ago???? The hell
YouTube recommend this trailer to me after 6 years😂😂<br>But still dhaasu trailer❤😎🔥
I didn&#39;t realise that it happened 6 year ago
random recommendation in 2024.<br>Fine ill rewatch it
I miss hulk
POV :- Watching trailer after watching the movie 😂🤣
Why is YT still recommending me this Trailer in 2024😂
It&#39;s 2024 and still one of my top MCU movies.
It&#39;s 2024 😊
Cate Blanchett as Hela is perhaps the sexiest thing I&#39;ve seen in a long time
It&#39;s not the best superhero movie but it absolutely is the best trailer for any comic book based film. Insane.
It&#39;s finally clear where Hulk is. Thor&#39;s depression was interesting. I wish there wasn&#39;t too much humor in it. Still, I&#39;m not deducting the score for Thor&#39;s sake. If such nonsense continues in the future, I think he will lose a lot of points...If you watch Marvel in Chronological form, you will understand it better. Let me show you in a list.....<br>Captain America: The First Avenger<br>Captain Marvel <br>Iron Man<br>The Incredible Hulk<br>Iron Man 2<br>Thor<br>avengers<br>Thor: The Dark World<br>Iron Man 3<br>Captain America: The Winter Soldier<br>Guardians of the Galaxy<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2<br>Avengers: Age of Ultron<br>Ant-Man<br>Captain America: Civil War<br>Black Panther<br>Spider-Man: Homecoming<br>Black Widow<br>Doctor Strange<br>Thor: Ragnarok<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp<br>Avengers: Infinity War<br>Avengers: Endgame<br>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings<br>Spider-Man: Far From Home<br>Eternals<br>Spider-Man: No Way Home<br>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness<br>Thor: Love and Thunder<br>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<br>The Marvels....
The best thor movie in the thor quadrilogy!
The only thing i see this trailer is to listen hotline miami2 song
Thor Ragnarok last bomb with Thanos
﴿إنَّ هَذِهِ تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شاءَ اتَّخَذَ إلى رَبِّهِ سَبِيلًا﴾ <br><br>[المزمل: ١٩]<br><br>Verily, this is an admonition, therefore whosoever will, let him take a Path to His Lord!<br><br>Quran : Surah 73: al-Muzammi
الافلام تجعلنا نحس بأن الحياة الدنيا مثيرة ولازم دائما تستمع بيها وما يصير اصلاً تحس بألملل والحزن وكأننا لسنا في الدنيا وكأننا في الآخرة!<br><br>بطبيعة الحال, الافلام(والمسلسلات والانمي والالعاب والموسيقى وبقية الشبكة المُضنِكة) هي أحد فِتَن الحياة الدنيا الي تعتبر شبه جديدة.<br>ف أرجوكم, تذكّروا(وانا معكم, لا ابرئ نفسي من جمال ومتعة هذه الاشياء التي تلعبُ بألنفسِ لعباً) :<br><br>وَمَا أُبَرِّئُ نَفْسِي ۚ إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ إِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّي ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ (53)<br>[القرآن الكريم: سورة يُوسف: آية رقم 53]

The music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=25">0:25</a> seconds 😇
Your videos are insane
😡
The best movie of Thor
Watchman River’s “Led Zeppelin fans” remark on his newest vid brought me back here.
To me this movie is literally the Shrek 2 of the MCU.
The last and only good Thor movie
Magic sword music fuckin slaps
How about the leak (tho)?
One of the best MCU films, so rewatchable.
this movie was amazing
6 years ago 😮
Why do they have to make sure they have a person as a perverted lesbian or homosexual they ruining movies by putting perverts in movies
Only real ones know the song in the background is from Hotline Miami 2 😤
In trailer he has his eye but in movie he has not<br>And his hammer in beautiful mountai n the New asgard but in trailer his mjonir was broke in street of new york

Let’s address the elephant in the room: the fishing industry. How do you make sure they don’t dump more plastic in the oceans ?
Does anyone notice that a lot of scenes in this trailer aren&#39;t even in the movie?
They kept the deleted alley scene.
Thor ragnarok full movie in hindi
Dreadful film thor as been turned into a fool
Definitely my favorite MCU movie next to Iron Man
I remember this Thor Ragnarok, it was one of the best marvel movies, in fact it’s still one of the best
Love how this trailer has Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number music
Song name?
the only good thing about Marvel is the inclusion of this song 💀💀💀
Sorry marvel you got the WRONG NUMBER
This is the best marvel movie
Thor got the wrong number
I love the music used in this movie.  And my favorite Thor movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=110">1:50</a>
Such a wasted opportunity to use line like “MY SISTER BROKE MY HAMMER”
HOTLINE MIAMI SONG 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thor Ragnarok ❤⚡♾️🛐
So boring...bla bla bla bla
gotta get a grip
This Movie was even better than love And Thunder
The most amazing superpower in the entire MCU is the musical talent of Mark Mothersbaugh.
Anyone 2023???
Magic Sword brought me here.
6 years ago already.....!? One of my favourites

Six years later and still the best Marvel trailer.
This introduced a new type of good movies for the mcu were every character had there own back ground and it still match’s with the colors and background of the good mcu movies
One of the greatest movies of all time<br>,,Are you thor god of hammers?&quot;
This movie is just fun
Who voiced Hela in this trailer? It doesn&#39;t sound like Cate Blanchett
Only if they had not shown Hulk in trailer it would have been such an entertaining shock values for audience.
We need this back. Love and thunder was horrible
I remember the hulk reminded me of me
This will be the greatest Thor movie ever. The Thor lighting scene at the bridge was peak.
cant believe marvel went from ragnarok to love and thunder
This movie ruined Thor&#39;s character
iwanmanjah like look Thor movie iwan manjah fans Marvel iwan manjah from Malaysia
This is probably the best trailer ever. The movie is great too, though.
It’s been 5 years and the lighting scene always gives me goosebumps.
I can&#39;t believe Ragnarok and Love and thunder are directed by same director 😂😂😂😂
Those times 🥳🥳we have something to show our childrens😂
all i can think about is hotline miami
great trailer
Anyone know that song from hotline miami 2?
Aw I miss this. The best thor movie
wow
R.I.P. Volstagg
what the actual f*** they used IN THE FACE OF EVIL from Hotline Miami 2 and I notice this now, 5 years later
Thank you marvel .
This trailer still hits. The music choice and the vibes just perfect, sad LaT was a downgrade
Peak
DO YOU LIKE HURTING OTHER PEOPLE?
OMG HOTLINE MIAMI
Hulk is great
Does anyone know the name of the score used aroung <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=59">00:59</a>?
El trailer fue bueno pero la peli....chistes cada 3 segundos y para colmos son chistes malos
marvel lo hizo de nuevo
Still one of the best movie of Marvel
The hype was insane . Felt myself getting charged in the theatre .
Loki and Hela <br>1 Look same<br>2 Play with knives <br>3 Same hair<br>4 Wear green<br>Banner to thor: are you sure you are not the adopted one?😂😂
Peak❤
There cannot be a better movie than this. 💖🔥🔥🔥🔥👊😎🎉🎉🎉
hotline miami 2 best ost
Tyler Rake Chris Hemsworth is the Best superhero in the history
HOTLINE MIAMI IS REAL!!!
OMG ITS THIS SONG I DIDNT REALIZE
Want a movie on father Odin and Godess of death
Never thought a hotline miami ost would be used for a marvel movie trailer lol
The MCU had references to the actual Norse Mythology myths and a different version of Ragnarök. I am going to inform you of a myth called &quot;Creation, Destruction, and Rebirth&quot;. The myth involves a lot of characters in this movie, but most of their names and relationships are different. The biggest one for me is Hela. Hela in CDR myth is still the goddess of death, but her real name is Hel, and she is the ruler of Helheim (not associated with her name and Christianity&#39;s &quot;Hell&quot; has no connection with Helheim or Hel&#39;s name). In CDR, Hel is actually Loki&#39;s daughter. Loki had three children, Hel, Fenrir (the wolf), and Jormungandr (the World Serpent that surrounds itself around Midgard and Jotunheim (realm of the giants)(not actually the realm of the frost giants, those actually live in Niflheim). Surtur is CDR is actually just &quot;Surt&quot;, but he still has his flaming sword and still plays a big part in Ragnarök. Ragnarök in CDR consisted of multiple battles between different people, so much death, and everything ends. Odin fights Fenrir, Fenrir swallows Odin whole, but a great soldier named Vidar will rip Fenrir&#39;s jaws apart and kill it. Loki and Heimdall fight each other in an epic battle, and they both end up killing each other. Thor fights Jormungandr, Thor slays down Jormungandr, but the venom of the World Serpent kills Thor. Surt fights Frey (NOT Frigga)(Frey is the child of Njord, sibling of Freya (still not Frigga)) but Surt slays her down. Surt unleashes his flaming sword upon the nine realms, and Surtur destroys almost everything and everyone, but a few people live. Thor&#39;s children (Modi and Magni) will live on what used to be Asgard along with Vidar and Vali. Thor&#39;s brother (Balder) will return to Asgard from Helheim (Previously killed by Loki) and join them at Asgard. <br>In CDR, the people of Asgard aren&#39;t actually called Asgardians, they are called &quot;Aesir&quot;. The Bifrost is in CDR, but it can ONLY be used to go between Asgard and Midgard, and ONLY GODS can travel along it, human CAN NOT use the Bifrost. In Thor: The Dark World, Jane Fosters plot armor was so thick that she denied Norse Mythology. <br><br>I think I explained enough. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to my comment.
Hulk vs Thor fight was good
Is it just me or has this film aged badly?  I mean sure at the time it was amusing, but after love and thunder it&#39;s become annoying
THIS MOVIE IS 10000000% BETTER THAN THOR LOVE AND THUNDER ⚡. HOPE WE IN THE NEXT MOVIE COULD WATCH THOR BE A REAL BADASS ELECTRIFYING THOR AGAIN⚡⚡⚡
I miss this Thor 😢<br>Now he is just a joke 😑
Death wish feelings
Mint movie
Il migliore film di thor
This is supposed to be a Marvel movie<br><br>Why did the music turn it into Hotline Miami? 😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=25">0:25</a> Stranger Things song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=26">0:26</a>
This movie will always feel like a Hulk movie to me instead of a Thor movie. Primarily because it’s the last time we saw the real Hulk. And it sure focuses on him a lot. He was also developed a bit better. Thor was always determined but Hulk had a much more interesting journey in my opinion.
Oi butcher 😏
Hotline miami. Can&#39;t believe they used this song.
I thought Hel was Loki’s daughter and Odin decided to banish her in Hell because of his visions that Hel, Fenrir and Jormungandr will start Ragnarök 🤔
Love from India ❤️🇮🇳
Who&#39;s Watching<br>In<br>2023💝🌟
Thor ragnarok 2017
Iam playing God Of War Ragnarok
This movie reminded me [heavily] of one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time... Flash Gordon (1980).Very 80&#39;s... it was fun.
I come to watch this trailer once a month.
Back when Thor was good
🙂
i love how pewds was cracking on seeing those chefs fail a meatball taskmaster
boring
Probably the best Thor movie out of them all
The track here is &quot;In The Face of Evil&quot; by Magic Sword. And to think later on here that it&#39;s actually remixed with &quot;The Immigrant Song&quot; is just epic.
What&#39;s the music @ :25?
When the trailer did Hulk&#39;s voice better than the movie...<br><br>I absolutely despise that autotune Hulk voice and kept expecting the dude to start spitting bars! Like, that&#39;s not the Hulk I wanna see 😂😂😂
Thor Ragnarok... more like BORE Ragnarok
THIS! THIS IS THE BEST THOR MOVIE OUT OF 4 OF THEM. ARGUE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER.
Can&#39;t believe this is 5 years ago
Stiill chilllll after seing thor lost his girlfriend⚡⚡⚡⚡
such a shame it didnt work twice
Without Jane..Thor had the best movie
They died Loki in every movie and in next series, again take it
The famious Th🌟or for explores and scientist🌍
so much better than Love and Thunder
Wheres kratos and why&#39;s thor skinny and not fat
December 2022
I love myself for playing well.<br>😍
loved it!
Is movie ko Oscar milna chahiye
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=91">1:31</a>?😊
Hotline Miami music!?
Man, I really hoped for Love and Thunder to be like Ragnarok. It was done so perfectly. What a shame, really.
Best Thor movie for me. This is badass while Love and Thunder feel so goofy.
It’s hard to believe that this movie was directed by the same director of Thor love and thunder
I can&#39;t believe they added magic sword music in this trailer and some of the best synthwave music on this, awesome.
Thor: Ragnarok is my favorite movie of all time.
По
no wayyy I&#39;m so dumb, I just realized that in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=6">0:06</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=56">0:56</a> was actually not in the movie, the settings changed. In the trailer it&#39;s in the city, while in the movie they are in Norway
there&#39;s no way they put In The Face Of Evil
Who&#39;s watching it in 2022<br>To get the excitement back after years
its been 5 years time really flies.
in this Thor korg talks about his mom and her boyfriend, then in Love and Thunder he&#39;s talking about how he was created by 2 dads....
My fav marvel movie
I hear <b>In The Face Of Evil</b>
This was the last time hulk looked good
Best marvel movie
It was the best of all the Thor movies
To be real &amp; honest:<br><br>Both Hulk &amp; Thor, who were the true masculine, real, &amp; Raw powered Heroes in the entire Marvel Universe movies, you MARVEL IDIOTS turned them hilarious. Shame on the writers, directors, producers &amp; especially actors, for accepting cheques over characters they&#39;re playing.<br><br>I am still mad at people for accepting &amp; then trashing Mark Ruffalo for being a different hulk.<br><br>May I remember you, Hulk &amp; Incredible Hulk were the only two iterations, where Hulk was Actually Hulk. Not even the Hulk in any Avengers movie, made it to that standard.<br><br>&amp; Thor? Seriously? He was made a bigger joker than Hulk in all after the 1st Original movie. It only went downhill after the second &amp; worse. But man, &quot;Love &amp; Thunder&quot;? Seriously?<br>It&#39;s went from &quot;Action&quot; genre to &quot;comedy&quot;. But if you please let me translate that &quot;comedy&quot; genre, I&#39;d say &quot;Terrible&quot;<br><br>I have the same feeling for &amp; about Dr. Strange in &quot;Multiversre of Madness&quot; too. I mean, Dr. Strange battled with Thanos who had all the five stones &amp; Dr. Strange turned his attacks into Figurative BUTTERFLIES.<br>But after experiencing multiverse, he failed to get Wanda, whom he knew very well &amp; she was quite powerful in avengers  but failed to save her brother &amp; her love, Vision and couldn&#39;t save the world from Thanos!<br>Now she dreams of her children, I wonder where they came from &amp; seriously, there was no ONE MAN WHO COULD STAND AGAINST HER, in the entire Kamar-Taj or the mighty Kamar-Taj entirely as one, as Dr. Strange stated to her. Not Even the Dr. Strange WHO FOUGHT THANOS, THAT HAD ALL THE 5 RINGS, to some extent. Seriously. I can go on. What a shame!<br><br>But, Marvel? Are you in your senses? Do you think your sequels are justifiable? Shame on you!<br><br>These sequel story writers &amp; directors are seriously out of their mind. Don&#39;t you see? They are not fit for the job. If you understand what I mean, even an X-Men character was present in a movie.<br><br>They&#39;re killing the franchise, meaning, the Marvel brand could be dead, In a very near future, if this trend continues!
Blade 2 still best Marvel movie 🤟
Its actually infitaar
This is a great screen and speaker test for a notebook computer or tablet.
haha funny zebra go roll
Best Thor movie hands down! The story, the characters, the plot, the emotions are everything unlike other thor movies like first one and second and the last one dumb and dumber 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Still the best Thor movie to date
mcu movies used to be better than their trailers , now it’s the opposite.
Best thor movies
this is a masterpiece compared to love and thunder. Real asgard is here. In the new one ASgard kinda lost its all culture. Taika went overboard with love and thunder.
This was the last movie we got to see THE INCREDIBLE HULK
I love Thor is so funny
Saw this because of my brothers 💪
Haven&#39;t seen any Marvel movies after this one, and this is one hulluva overrated movie. Storyline is razor thin, the jokes don&#39;t land and I felt totally indifferent to what happened to the characters. Much prefer Doctor Strange,  Antman and The first Avenger movie.
I wish I could back and relive the good times again I just can’t understand the 2020s. Because the 2000s and the 2010s became the best thing of my childhood and teenage years and college years as well.
Just the simple fact they played hotline Miami 2 songs in the trailer already made this movie a masterpiece. It&#39;s been already 5 years since it came out wich is insane
Cap thumbnail
Firstly I didn&#39;t watched trailer and went directly for movie and surprise Entry of Hulk was awesome
GOD OF THUNDER     <br>🥰
Hope we see this hulk again in the future
I know every line to this movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=120">2:00</a> wow he has 2 eyes
Who is here after love and thunder
After love and thunder
WHAT I DIDN&#39;T KNOW ABOUT THIS, MAGIC SWORD GOT HIS MUSIC ON A MARVEL TRAILER?
There were no Jews and blacks in Norse culture. If any whites played as wakandans there would be riots
Can&#39;t wait to see this masterpiece!!!<br>The wait is killing me!!
Best MCU solo charachter movie
Korg
Osm❤
Bro they put hotline Miami music I. This tralier
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=107">1:47</a>
I come back here after the forth movie. I miss Loki and the humour😢
Im die hard hela fan 🔥🔥🔥.. What a swag 🔥wow.
Man they messed up big time with Love and Thunder. Ragnarok is way more superior compared to that.
Stil waiting on Thor Ragnarok 2: Wrong Number
Me after watching this after 5 years: so much has happened since I last saw you , i wish I could go back then in time and relive all these years again having my present conciousness 🤞⏳🤞
Happy birthday Chris
I still get excited to watch both the official trailer and Teaser trailer for THOR Ragnarok. My favorite MCU movie.
Hotline Miami music in a Marvel movie trailer
Thor love and thunder 😂🤣
This was the last time where Hulk was incredible
Is this similar to Record of ragnarok?
bhlkthbrhbgoigyrydsfgfhjgbhfdjgerty6e786yteiurthgdrkfbghfgyfudte7yrguhedfhjgbyetresrgfhd
great movie
💚🎯
Hotline Ragnarok<br>Wrong hammer
best movie ever
How have i never seen this trailer? Its really good
Still the best Marvel movie
Ragnarok&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; love and thunder
This is way better than Love and Thunder
The fact that he&#39;s really underrated Avenger. That&#39;s why I always tell people Thor can easily defeat Scarlet Witch. BRING HER SCARLET!
Loki is the only person nobody hates..♥️
I think Marilyn Manson did a good job in his roll as Hela.
This movie was cursed for Thor 😂
The part where he is talking with doctor strange was past the credits in doctor stranges movie we&#39;re just seeing the extended version of it now I do feel bad for him no gf loses an eye father sister and his hammer as well when korg tells him the room they are in is a circle Thor says this doesn&#39;t make any sense than Korg says no nothing makes sense here man the only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense like WTF lol that totally lost me I love how he throws Thor around the same way he did Loki now he knows how his brother felt but yeah he did technically win that fight though the grand master played dirty i love when Thor is talking to Korg about his hammer and it got a little fresh lol he&#39;s not wrong when he said sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with this hammer and then losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one which Thor knows very well he lost his mom
👏
I can&#39;t believe Dr Strange got a cameo, but not me
hellloooo :))
Thor like smoldering fyre.
🥰🥰
I can believe Dr Strange got a cameo but not me. Stephen won&#39;t stop annoying me about it
Loki is always my favorite from the start to the end
Didn’t expect a Hotline Miami song in this
omg 5 years later after thor: love and thunder came out 😭
Ok, yeah, it&#39;s a funny movie and it has the Kirby aesthetic, but oh my god, the color grading is awful and it makes me mourn the idea of Thor as a character I can take seriously, of events that should be taken seriously.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=117">1:57</a> weird seeing him with 1 eye<br>Edit: I mean 2
Personally, this is by far the best Marvel movie for me. It&#39;s the only one I can watch multiple times without getting bored. Not that my opinion matters at any rate. The trailer is kick-A++
Thor love and thunder
This is still the best Thor movie
Way better than The Luv and Thunder bullsh*t  :(
Black Panther will always be my favorite Marvel movie but this one is definitely up there!
Thor has lost: eye, brother, sister, father, mother, best friend, other friends, home, hammer, and now in love and thunder, weight
I rather watch this than the appalling disaster that is Love and Thunder. I feel there was a lot of love and thunder put into Ragnarok.
This movie is better than thor love and thunder
This One Is Still The Best Thor Movie
A good, really BAD &quot;B&quot; movie in 1980&#39;s style.  80&#39;s style theme music and everything.<br>Why can&#39;t they all be like this?
Bull~hit.
the best non-avengers movie by a mile
Okay
One of my fav film 😍, I&#39;m still watch it many times until now, how about you guys<br><br>Thor 2013 : this ends now<br>Thor love and thunder : this ends here and now⚡
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=80">1:20</a> I remember seeing this trailer when I was about 8 and thought “that’s the bad guy” now watching this I was very disappointed in myself
Affter watching Thor Love and Thunder, this episode is still the best of Thor series.
Love and Thunder would have been better with ou saviour<br>(U know who i meant ..
6TH SCENE<br>MOVING UP
Even though I enjoyed Love and Thunder, I don&#39;t think any Thor movie is gonna top this one
Un popular opinion: THIS IS 1 of The BEST MARVEL FILMS EVER MADE. <br>EDIT: I Just watched Thor love and thunder it&#39;s just okay and visually stunning movie but Ragnarok is still top notch for me
Can&#39;t believe Taika Watiti made Ragnarok
⚡Thor: Ragnarok⚡far far better then thor love❤and thunder⚡ too much jokes
How can we find this full movie in Hindi or Urdu because I am trying very much but I do mot findthis movie in you tube
I absolutely loved valkyrie, wish she ended up with thor instead of jane!
Who is watching after watching Thor love and thunder ⚡😁😁
Hulk
Way better than the Latest..!!
Ragnarok is way better than love and thunder
First Marvel movie jise theatre me dekhne ko mila
Infinity War ke Baad Ragnarok 2nd Best Movie Hai
Yes, I’m here to wash my eyes after watching Thor disney princess 4
Man seriously Thor Ragnarok is so much better than Thor love and thunder, Ragnarok perfectly balanced humor ,there was no forced comedy and teaming up with hulk was so good,I wished love and thunder could have been like that.
still the best Thor movie
Hela : Oh I Miss This <br>Me : yeah Metoo ;)
ngl this movie &gt; love and thunder
I know I am very late, but you dont cast a person of color for a position that hasn&#39;t been written to be of color, that&#39;s disrepectful, always have to integrate, and ruin the stories, and tales that we&#39;re grown up with, and to be honest history, or mythology. You shouldn&#39;t force your agendas and re-write the storytelling. <br><br>There is plenty oppertunity to cast people of color in other movies, I am super late ... The world was already turning into madness back in 2017. Not white supremacy, or anything it just dont stick very well to change hundreds, if not thousand years worth of worship, and religion/belief to have a little diversity, you can do that in other movies, or create whole new movies, especially when it comes to valkyries.<br><br>You shouldn&#39;t alter, or screw with something that is perfectly fine the way it is, and gives the middle finger to thousands of years, if not only hundreds of said belief, religion. <br>Every race has had it bad throughout history, every race has been captives that we are unfortunate that america controls the media and they&#39;re talking about black captives more than its needed, it was a small probably not even a percent of all captives throughout history but because its america and there happen to be a smalll, tiny, tiny little bit of african americans it has to be the biggest topic, its sad.<br><br>And as we&#39;ve seen over the years, now 2022 its become worse and worse with this captive stuff.
super movie
From Led Zeppelin to Guns and Roses, they really know how to pick bands
taika waititi how did we went from this awesome movie  to Thor love and thunder
Who is there after thor : love and thunder 🤠👇🏻
This is SO much better than Thor love and thunder. Ragnarok is the best Thor movie
I only came because after I saw Thor Love And Thunder I missed Loki And Hulk! The movie was great but not as much as this one although I did enjoy Natalie Portman’s Mighty Thor.
Ragnarok was the best Thor film ever. <br>I&#39;ve just seen Love and Thunder and didn&#39;t like that much.
Love and thunder was good
Best Marvel Film Ever SCK LadderStand
Far Better than Love &amp; Thunder 💩
I rewatch Ragnarok over and over again and still laugh everytime 😍😅<br><br>Hope I will say the same for Love and Thunder... so far the reviews have been mixed and disappointing but still am looking forward to see it<br><br>It&#39;s been delayed in my country for censorship reasons I guess so I&#39;ll be able to see it next week
Who came here after watching thor love and thunder???
Нужно посмотреть...
Hela is more of a god butcher than Gorr, Thor is even more of a god butcher than Gorr also LOL
Thor 3 best movie comparison 2 thor 4🥲🔥
And now you see.... That this movie is untouchable
Five years later, it’s still the best Thor movie.
Today i just saw thor love and thunder but still i love thor ragnarok.....
Better than Thor Love and thunder
♥️ &amp; ⚡️
Much much much better than love and thunder
Welcome back! Have you come here after getting disappointed by Love and thunder too? Yeah same pinch.
Masterpiece 🙌🏻
Going back to this trailer to forget how Love and thunder is a joke. 😂
Im glad this Trailer is recommended to me and...<br>Who come here after Love and thunder?
Who is coming here after getting disappointed by thor love and thunder?
Nice to see Billy butcher transformation after he took compound V
I love the musicc
Legends watch this video in 2022😅
Marvelous Music 🎶🎶
I just watched this again after watching the Love and Thunder trailer. The quality in visual effects here is miles better than Thor: LaT
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=141">2:21</a> he looked much smaller from a distance
When Hella catches Thor’s hammer they were not there and this is my first time watching the trailer
HOTLINE MIAMI
Still my favourite marvel movie, love and thunder might surpass this tho
Can’t believe this song was actually from hotline Miami 2: wrong number
Great
Hotline maimi refrence??????
This is to much nostalgia 😭
still remember the date i watched it 15/11/2017 :) fav marvel solo movie
Who came after watching Thor Ragnarok 4D directed by James Corden?
how did he got two eyes in the trailer? while he lost his one eye in the movie
It&#39;s so weird to hear this song after hearing it in Hotline Miami.
I like how in the trailer thor still had both eyes
Magic swords music just fits this movie so well.
I feel pity for thor in Avengers infinity war... Struggled to get powers back in Ragnarok and than shitted badly 😂😂
Magic sword in a marvel trailer? Didn’t know that.
Is Thor: Ragnarok one of the worst movies of 2017? Is it a fried franchise?
i love it how she says here we go. She&#39;s a tease
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=112">1:52</a> axxx Marvel tricked us 16464651 times with trailer.This is one of them.I want see that fight Hela vs Hulk
Hammer breaking seen was different
Who was here after watching Thor 4  movie
Watching this trailer in 2022 before the release of thor: love and thunder, <br>And it still giving me goosebumps.<br>This is a movie can i watch again and again
Once again watching in 2022

Recommend 😂
Who else got this in their recommendations.
Why am watching this before loving kindness
Is it just me or who&#39;s here after watching love and thunder trailer?
In the real movie, Hela comes out of her prison at some grass field. In the trailer, it looks like some alley. I wonder where this is.
Anyone else here back in the lead up to love and thunder?
no gonna lie this the funniest MCU movie ever
This is one of the few marvel films where you can just watch it several times a year and don&#39;t get sick of it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=117">1:57</a> You can See Thor both eyes <br>..<br>..<br>..<br>That&#39;s why I love Marvel movies they never let you know about what is happening except ( Peter Parker )Tom Holland 😂😂
You know that Marvel had to hide that thor lost his eye in the trailer. brave!
one of the best marvel movies⚡🔥
New thor trailer looks great
After Love and Thunder trailer?
Me watching this after watching Love and Thunder trailer &quot;What have you done Marvel&quot; 😭😭😭

I always see this film as the calm before the storm that was Infinity War
lmao this is good hotline miami 2 music
hi
Who&#39;s here after Thor love and thunder trailer ❤️🌌
11/10!
Trailer : both eye&#39;s <br>Movie : one eye<br>The part his eye&#39;s glow&#39;s
This is the one movie, I can watch many times and still enjoy
that was awesome! can&#39;t wait to see the movie
If my wife was even 5 percent of kate ,, I would feel like thor ⚡🔨,,, but my wife is jabba the hutt from star Wars 😭😭😭😭😭, sombody help me what do I do with this creature???
A true green gem in the marvel cinematic universe
i love this movie
i JUST realised that this trailer has Hotline Miami music at the background
Nahi
This movies 5 years old wtf
This movie made Thor my favourite fictional character.
spoiler<br><br><br><br><br><br>its cool how they still took different scenes from the movies and stitched them together to make a different outcome, like when hela says &quot;i thought youd be glad to see me, instead of her own attack, it shows surtur(the big fire monster)&#39;s final blow
Still One Of My Fav Marvel Movie Ever &quot;THOR RAGNAROK&quot; Can&#39;t Wait For &quot;THOR LOVE &amp; THUNDER&quot; ❤️
Hotline Thor 2
Masterpiece!
I didn&#39;t enjoy Ragnarok. Too much comedy. Thor lost his hammer. Odin died and Asgard was destroyed. A more realistic depiction of loss should have been shown.
I am the only one who is watching this in 2022?
Funniest marvel movies of all time, hands down!!!
Best movie ever🥰
Looking back, this was such a bad trailer.
i got excited when ian malcom went into space
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=119">1:59</a> we see that thor has both eyes but in movie at that scene he has only one eye. <br><br><br><br><br>Thanks for 7.6k likes.
Did u notice that they changed the background when hela destroys mjolnir in the movie
Can&#39;t wait for this movie. Maybe Thor gets a new weapon after the destruction of Mjolnir
lollllLLOoaKmz
❤️
I’m so excited to watch this movie in negative 4 years
Cant for this movie<br><br><br><br>Lol
my biggest regret in life was not seeing this in cinema bc i never liked any of thor&#39;s past movies, just for this to turn out to be my favorite mcu solo film
Best Avenger⚡💙

So, How to Make a Blockbuster movie trailer is right
Honestly, at the start of the MCU, who&#39;d have thought that Thor was going to turn out to be one of the best characters with one of the best individual movies?  But... there it is.

<b>Thor: Love and Thunder trailer drops</b><br>Youtube recommendations: go watch the other epic one
Here after the New Thor: Love and Thunder trailer. Really showing the journey Thor has been on, from this need to fight, loss, tragedy, depression, and now just wanting peace and figure out who he is now.<br><br>Also, the hype around Hela and her reveal in Ragnarok vs Gorr not even being shown or mentioned in Love and Thunder is a big contrast. It makes me so hype to see Gorr now and the chaos he&#39;s bringing to the universe.
Watching this trailer again, Makes me wants to re-watch all 3 of Thor&#39;s movies again till Thor: Love &amp; Thunder gets releases
Hits nostalgic after love and thunder teaser.
Who&#39;s here after Love and Thunder&#39;s trailer

Family NYKs
Trailer spoils a lot of the movie. Great movie tho
Thor truly deserves the title of &quot;Mightiest Avenger&quot;!<br>One of the greatest superheroes of all time, hands down!<br>And what a great dynamic he has with Hulk too. So much fun!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=112">1:52</a> epiic
I never get tired of watching this, no matter how many times.
👍👍👍
Hela, Thor, and Loki would&#39;ve been the most powerful trio in the MCU, if Odin didn&#39;t have crappy parenting.
Mfk fans like adi
Waiting for thor love and thunder ❤
Song name is in the face of evil
The trailer gives way too much away
Ok but is no one gonna talk about magic sword’s amazing piece for this trailer? 🔥🔥🔥
Waw 4 yrs later
Even after literally rewatching this movie almost a thousand times, I still love it!!! Taika Waititi gave a gust of fresh air to Thor&#39;s personality and heroism and added some much needed humor and comedy to the God of Thunder, as well as the rich sibling dynamic with his brother Loki. I&#39;m also captivated by Valkyrie, Korg, Bruce Banner/Hulk, Grandmaster, and even Hela, they all kept me very entertained throughout the movie... I&#39;m the first one back here, who else is eagerly waiting for the teaser trailer to Thor: Love And Thunder?!?!?!?! ☁️☁️⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡☁️☁️🔨🔨🪓🪓
this is my favoirite mcu movie
Read this--&gt;&gt;&gt; a true review<br><br>One of the worst movie of MCU.<br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m a big fan of Marvel Studios but when It came to watch this Movie , in the beginning I were like &quot; cool Doctor Strange, cool beginning&quot; then after, became worst and worst.<br><br>You could have not takeing anymore this movie serious they were jokeing about everyone and everything there was no one scene without a joke and in the movie Asgard is falling people are dying  but yea lets joke all the <b>****</b> movie!<br><br>Honestly In Thor 1 and Dark world it was more serious how it have to be and then some joke but not all the movie, there is a war people are escapeing trying to survive and yes let&#39;s make some fun.<br>For some clip it was cool and intense but most, nope like --no way.
This best marvel movie
We are the part of thor ⚡🔨
I can’t believe this movie came out 5 years ago
Still one of the best trailers Marvel has ever produced.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=5">0:05</a> that’s not where he got his hammer broke???
Why recommend this trailer now? I hope Thor love and thunder trailer soon😌
I feel like taika definitely played some hotline Miami
Thor is the god of thunder.... not the god of hammer😎
2022 gang 💀
Thor Ragnarok? More like Bore Ragnarok
This is the awesome movie and I watch this movie about 10 time 🥰
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=111">1:51</a> Should have been added to the movie
Disliked this movie. But glad others liked it. Wasn’t the worst thing I’ve seen, but wasn’t as enjoyable imo.
Who is here while waiting for thor love &amp; thunder trailer??
Nobody:<br>Literally nobody:<br>Le YouTube: recommends Thor-ragnarok trailer on soon arrival of Thor- love and thunder🤣
If lightning is the anger of the gods then the gods must be primarily concerned with trees
Who&#39;s ready for Thor love and thunder
Who else is waiting for Thor Love and Thunder trailer?
Pov: You get this recommend when Love and thunder starts to hype up.
watched this twice! This is one of the best mcu film even though the trailer is somehow deceiving
Best Trailer Ever Made!!!!!!
The pacifier, more like bore ragnararok
So cringe. Marvel is trash
Knowing that Natalie is going to be the new Thor. Don&#39;t they know that Thor is a name and not a title. I suppose we&#39;ll have Chris Pine as the new Diana aka Wonder Woman sooner or later! 🤦
YOU DID NOT HELP UKRAIN,,😠

W Movie
This is a very controversial opinion<br>But its my favourite marvel movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=120">2:00</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=121">2:01</a>
Le trailer il donne vraiment pas envie, c&#39;est incroyable.
Let me just say; this is not a thor movie. This is a movie that is a comedy with Thor in it. The tone is all over the place. And there are so many moments in this where, Thor looks and feels like a shmuck that I’m genuinely surprised he can keep his pants on
Why it recommemed me after 4 yrs
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me watching this 4 years later
Oh c,mon<br>We need love and thunder trailer...
Why this video is recommended after 4 year , does this hint that they are going to drop thor 4 trailer in the few upcoming days ?
To be honest i love this movie more than Endgame. It&#39;s infinity war, this and spider man 3:Bully No More. Endgame was meh for closing for 20+ movie.
I thought this was love and thunder for a min
Why is this on my recommendation 4 years after
i&#39;m from VietNam, who is Vietnamese and really like Marvel like me????
Idk why this trailer is in my feed. Watched it again. Watched movie twice. Best Thor movie♥️
Is everybody gonna ignore the fact that hotline miami music is in this trailer lmao

Imagine Hela and Thor fighting and Thanos came with his Ship .....who would have won
Thor realizing that he lost these much relatives of his in previous movies and knows that the next turn is his!!
The fact that Mrbeast&#39;s squid game got more than twice the views than this big budget movie trailer is really surprising!!
Mark My word they&#39;ll lunch Thor love and thunder teaser within a 1 month..thats why we started to got recommend  this trailer 💯💯
I can&#39;t express how much I loved Korg and Thor&#39;s conversation in this movie , purely the best typical Mcu movie ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=118">1:58</a> anyone notice that he has both eyes but in the actual movie in this scene he only has one

If odin was a good father we wouldn&#39;t need avengers or guardians of the galaxy or anything thor loki and hela would have destroyed thanos and his team with ease
O melhor filme do Thor
🤤🤤🤤
Galadriel and Eomer fight togeather
Anyone 2022 ❤️🔥
I&#39;ll be honest, the first time I saw this trailer, I wasn&#39;t hyped about the movie. I thought, eh. It looks alright, but probably won&#39;t be all that great. But then when I saw it in theaters I was like WOW, this movie was soo AWESOME! I&#39;ve watched it 3-4 times and will probably rewatch it again sometime. This trailer just did not do it justice to how good the movie actually is, but I&#39;m glad that it wasn&#39;t the other way around. It sucks when a movie trailer is better than the actual movie.
I’m the only one watching in 2022
I hope Love and Thunder trailer releases today or tommorow
The trailer is from 2017?🤯 wow time flies!
The way bruce says Did I Win? Makes me laugh everytime
My most favorite marvel movie. Now bring on Thor: Love &amp; Thunder!!!!
It&#39;s look like Thor enter in the Cyberpunk era
Best Thor Movie ❤️
Hulk smash
Seeing 2 Strongest Avengers in a Single Movie is Great<br><br>Thor Hulk
Seeing 2 Strongest Avengers in a Single Movie is Great<br><br>Thor Hulk
Man things have really changed since this movie. I love this so much
What i see: Thor<br>What i hear: Scene 6: Moving Up
This trailer sucks. You knew everything before watching the movie
The trailer itself is good but the soundtrack still fits better with hotline miami 2 , this soundtrack just doesn&#39;t fit with the trailer tbh .
This is how a perfect solo superhero movie is to be made
Watching this trailer after the movie <br>This trailer reveals everything, very unappealing trailer <br>Including the best dialogue of what were u the god of again... and thunder pours
amazing movie
I still remember watching this as a 9 year old<br>Oh man i cant believe that it has been 4 years
He lost his hammer, hair, eye, father, girlfriend, home, and in the next movie he lost his brother, Heimdall, half of his people, and after that due to his ego half the universe but still, We Love Him
Honey! I love this ❤️🖤💙
I love how they used Magic Sword &quot;In The Face of Evil&quot;  for this trailer. It fits so well.
can&#39;t wait to watch this!!!
Can we just talk about how hot loki is in this movie?
Anybody know I watch it&#39;s trailler after 4 years😆😆😆😆
Little suggestions on Thors attack moves<br><br>Can you make him do a type of whirlwind attack, where he would just turn on himself (knees) with his axe, turning in circles, attracting enemies close to him, while he decapitates them one by one
is that a hotline miami music in the background?
Waiting for thor love&amp;thunder ❤️❤️
Dang..... Thanos was a piece of trash if he had to face hella...... Only if odin was a good dad 🙄
I am watching this trailer in 2022 and still I loved it
Why this in my recommended rn
Do you guys know that hela actually  is loki daugher
Ragnarok must never happen.
God of War Ragnarok no go.
No my Twin is not Tyr.
Litterally a Law of Physics. I&#39;am Litterally Tyr. Look at the game. I&#39;am &quot;Matt Tuck&quot;. My twin is me also. But I&#39;am only one me.
God of War Ragnarok not possible to Launch.
Ok look. Ragnarok, not happen. K. Tyr me.
Captain America is my favourite hero but OH MY GOD what a movie and what amazing character development of Thor and Loki😮🤯 I still can&#39;t believe that they made a Thor movie so funny 👏
Thor ki best movie thi
How about thor vs electro a movie
i have watch all mcu movies even though it is fictional it will be my most  favorite and i will not stop watching even if i get old fan forever
Filme bom. Nível cósmico do universo..

Song: Wrong number<br>Artist: Scattle
Decent film. Very Flash Gordon! Love the Immigrant song touch! Awesome 👌
This is the funniest marvel movieee😂😂
Okay but music from Magic Sword 👀👀👀
Anyone 2022
One of my fav movies
But you keep trying your going to die.
It is not legal to kill the son if the Father dies while imprisoned.
The Bifrost works on laws.
I&#39;am the Bifrost also you idiot.
Yeah there actual Laws.
The Justice League is real.
The Headgears... I&#39;am the Prince of Britannia. Each solar system is a different Time. I used a Cellular phone to lock your dad from his powers.
You tube recommend me after 4 years....

Adam warlock enemy of Thor or guardian of the galaxy?
Only if they haven&#39;t shown hulk in trailer. In theaters it would be so good
what’s up!
4 years later... Recommended...
It&#39;s wrong trailer
Antwan did a great job directing this movie
Imagine if they didn’t show Hulk in the trailer. Too bad Marvel cares too much about money.
Now Both Became Smoldering Fire 😂🥺
As EPIC as this trailer is, I am GLAD I had refrained from watching it prior to watching the movie! Give the whole thing away!
Thor: Ragnarok is justan overrated disappointment. Too many jokes all at once that really interfered the storytelling, character development, action sequences, tone and the film took all the heart, emotion, drama, tension, weight and substance away, all thrown out the window at once, just to add more room for the humour and that&#39;s it. This is absolutely ridiculous. No offence to Taika Waititi, but he is not the right person to direct Thor: Ragnarok. He&#39;s a part of this problem. He should get fired from Marvel and never work on another film project with them again, because of the quality control reasons. And besides, it doesn&#39;t even matter anyway, Taika Waititi and Marvel are only making this film for the money. Not to tell us a good story, not to teach us anything, not to give us important life lessons, not to give us a<br>good experience, not to give us any good messages or subject matters, not to develop the characters properly, not caring whether it&#39;s going to be good or not, but to make money!
Somehow this came into my feed today! Know what this means? A teaser for love and thunder is on the way!
Me after watching NWH<br>Youtube algorithm: let&#39;s recommend him the trailer of ragnarock
It’s really crazy going back and watching old trailers of movies you have already seen, and thinking that this was a legit trailer and that nobody knew anything about the movie is just really weird
Taika Waititi best movie is &quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot;. Change my mind!
That was the best Marvel Movie
I could not express my feelings in text, I love this movie a lot  💕 <br>MCU 💕
Best trailer ever made in MCU<br>Taika watiti🔥
epic trailer yo
Omg Thor!
Why recommend this to me after 4 years
The Marvel movie that got me into the MCU
Wow!! This movie looks amazing, when is it releasing?
Um dos melhores filmes da Marvel!!! A Hela então!!! Muito bom!!!
Realizing this came out 4 year ago<br><b>Ages massively</b>
The best movie in MCU ♥️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=43">0:43</a> best part<br><br>I didn&#39;t see trailer before the movie, so i was pleasantly surprised to see Hulk/Bruce.
Funny
November 23, 2017
What game your are playing dont work no i know but he can
Thor series are my favourite in the whole MCU era then Guardians. Both visuals, storylines and JOKES are unmatched. CANNOT BELIVE this was almost 5 years ago. WOW time flies
&quot;Do you like hurting other people?&quot;
Irony is that i watch this trailer after i saw the movie 10times
Hotline Asgard
My favorite film solo🛐🛐
ive prob seen this film a dozen times, its def Marvels best movie, every character is great, score is awesome, best marvel villain, great story, a perfect movie with comedy and action
Bring Me Thanos
Can’t wait for this one! It looks so cool!
Surprise!!!!
marvel really learned a lesson on thor movies
Thor: Chisterok.
A movie for little kids
Me after watching this : <b>cries in Asgardian</b>
wow did yt algorithm got me this trailer from 4 yrs ago , unbelievable
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=5">0:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=11">0:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=90">1:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=87">1:27</a>
After 4 years this is in my recommendations. Brought back my memories of watching this. This movie is one of the reasons I believe Thor is the strongest Avenger physically and mentally. One of my favourites superheroes
Each MCU movie has it own raw trailer💯
What Person put hotline Miami music to this trailer
I just love the Hotline Miami 2 music
Does Bruce&#39;s voice when he asks &quot;Where are we&quot; sound a little distorted and weird? Or am I crazy? Right at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=30">0:30</a>...
wow😍🤩
Back when Infinity war and endgame didn’t happen just yet, all was good 🥲
Anyone 2021🔥❤️
oh i didn&#39;t noticed this is 4 years ago
So we all united again. <br>All thanks to YouTube Algorithm.
First time i watched this was so good I would recommend it to everyone
As you can see, thor’s left eye is still there but in the movie his left eye was injured by hela. In my theory, trailers can be so confusing. So that’s why Tobey and Andrew will be in No Way Home for sure even they’re not shown in the trailers. You can’t change my mind marvel:)
This trailer is better than the movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=120">2:00</a> where did he get his second eye dint he lost it
This trailer revealed the whole movie.
Thank god I did not see this before watching the movie.
Who are waiting for thor Ragnarok
I miss MCU movies 😭
I really dont understand recommendations
How many people see this trailer after seeing this movie about 10 more times <br>2022 like....
its December 2021
guys i from the future here to tell you this will be one of the best marvel movies
That&#39;s why never trust Marvel trailer
up
I cant believe this was released in 2017
La musica Me recuerda a <b>hotline maimi 2</b>
Keren parah ini filmnya
I feel old
Glad I didn&#39;t see this before the movie..
Song: In The Face Of Evil- Magic Sword (Edited)
Хелла = Малефесента
I&#39;m here in November 2021 ...😁
When Love &amp; Thunder comes out, this movie will witness a surge in streaming.
Born and raised with actual Norse mythology in the background to Protestant Christendom, I really oughta hate Stan Lee and MCU&#39;s take on Thor. But, I just can&#39;t seem to make it. Let the kids play.
Have the 3D Blu-Ray with the IMAX Ratio Changes!!!
Welcome to the Time Variance Authority
Trailer is little different than movie
Still get goosebumps while watching this trailer
By far the BEST Thor
Epic
Why is this recommended
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 4 years 🥲
WHY DID I ONLY KNOW THAT THIS WAS PREMIERED BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY! nov4
this is so un apreciated it should have more likes
top 3 marvel movie
gonna be gold if Taika can be on Conan
Wish to see the same hype in Thor:Love and Thunder too!!!!
I didn&#39;t search for this..
🌚 للحين م شفته
The only thing they didn&#39;t spoil in the trailer was sarter destroying asgard.
What’s the music in this???
Hotline Miami music is going  brrrrrr
The film that ruined thor
Colourful movie 🔥
who would knew this movie was going to be the best movie in the entire mcu
Wow this dude remind me of someone, but I cant remember who
I remember i watched this in the theatre
Wow
Bomb trailer! So freaking cool!
mucha nostalgia al ver este trailer
Here is my theory, frigga always been a good mother and loved hela, so when hela was gone she gave loki her green theme.
hulk shouldn&#39;t have been in the trailer, im so glad I didn&#39;t see it before watching the film. Imagine how sick it would be if he was a complete surprise
Flying soldiers with wings in space? Flash Gordon from 1980.?
I like how they just told the whole story by one trailer
After 4 years I got this as recommended
Still watching after 4 years
This trailer still gives goosebumbs ❤️
No wonder this trailer looks Soo many views....even after watching the whole movie this trailer looks Soo amazing 🔥
Thor the strongest avenger
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s almost 5 years old
THOR❤️❤️❤️
Anybody knows what happened to Hela&#39;s man? The bald guy. I remember he&#39;s escaping with the Asgardians at the end of the movie
Imagine if they hadn&#39;t revealed hulk in the trailer, the entire cinema would go wild
God of war 😂
<b>Hotline Miami</b>
I still wanna see hela vs Thanos, no stones
I think I might have the wrong number
Learned today this is hotline Miami music playing in the background
HOTLINE MIAMI 2 MUSIC THEY WERE RIGHT
In the face of evil. Great song choice.
Watch the video<br>🖕🖕👆👆✌️✌️
Thor is brave men 💪💪💪
👍👍👍👆👆
Pagal hai to 🤪😜😝😛
How Thor Have 2 Eyes In The End LoL 😂
I don&#39;t understand why people say Black Panther was the best solo movie in the MCU, when this masterpiece exists.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=26">0:26</a>  track name please
Editing on Thors eye in the trailer is nice
When it realase: Super movie in MCU <br><br><br>Now: we need thor and the love of thunder
The song is “In the Face of Evil” by Magic Sword, in case anyone was wondering 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=142">2:22</a> easily the best shot of the movie and they used it as a gag.
Best trailer ever.
I like that and I&#39;m on the way <br>Loki i hope you have something for me
Digital thor
This Hulk was gone too soon.
Can’t believe this was 4 years ago!
Is loki coming in thor love and thunder?
I like how Thor, Loki, and Valkyrie have a cape and hulk is just shirtless with black pants
Ya pasaron cuatro años 😧
The Thor trilogy should be called: Disfunctional family
The most rewatchable movie
Melhor filme da Marvel disparado!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hotline Miami baby!!
this with MONTERO BGM is so fit tho...!!!
If I see another Super Hero movie I&#39;m gonna puke. Same with all the Fox News Anchors promoting all Thier BS opinions while pushing Thier books on TV.<br>To all fox news anchors. 🖕
Who doesn&#39;t love Jeff Goldblum playing himself in yet another movie. His range as an actor is astounding.
Hela, Valkyrie, &amp; The Grandmaster were honestly the most things to look forward to in the movie.
827K likes for WHAT? oh man..
Shang-Chi &gt; Ragnarok
I hear a lil’ bit of Hotline Miami 2 in here..,
This movie was sooooooooo funny
It is funny how everyone from the OG Thor Movie From Asgard are now dead.... With exception of Thor and Sif
Thor 4 trailer is coming it recommended me today all of a sudden universe giving me a hint tat Thor 4 trailer is on the way
One of the best movie
Well Hulk wasn&#39;t lying when he said Thor like small fires and he like raging fire
the best thor movie
Is epic
No entiendo algo si thor es gordo porque no buscan un artor gordo
Loki shouldnt be like this until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=82">1:22</a>
Where my hotline miami 2 fans at?
Thor ragnorok Is better than avengers endgame...<br><br><br>Change my mind
Waiting for the kind hearted person who can actually support me from this heart and understand my problem ❤️😖😖😭😭😭
They need to make every trailer like this one so badass
Ragnarok had trailer?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue80QwXMRHg&amp;t=5">0:05</a> it was retaken for the movie
God of Thunder :- <b>*Gets Electroned</b><br><br>God of Mischief :- <b>*Gets Tricked</b><br><br>Godess of Death :- <b>*Dies</b><br>😑😑😑
Why is there still an eye?
Me When Trailer Starts: &quot;So Much Happened Since I Last Saw You<br>• I Grow Up<br>• Chadwick Died<br>• Iron Man Died<br>• COVID<br>• Loki Got His Glorius Purpose <br>• Many More....
Why is the algorithm blessing me with this trailer loo
can NOT wait for Love and Thunder.
Presenting Thor Ragnarok <br>In which<br>The God of thunder: <b>gets electrocuted</b><br>The god of mischief: <b>gets tricked</b><br>The goddess of death: <b>dies</b>
Thor is my favorite drama😍🥰🥰.
I still can watch it 1000 times!
Taika Waititi is a genius
Waiting for thor ❤ &amp; ...............
Waiting for Thor ♥️ and ⚡
It’s already been 4 years to this epic movie.
Why I&#39;m here today 🙄?
Whoever watching this will possesses the love for Thor
When the other avengers fighting for a big decision in life<br><br>Strongest avengers: Fighting like brothers
I love Thor with short hair 😂
I cant even count how many times I&#39;ve watched this movie.
As much as I love Captain America The Winter Soldier and Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2, Avengers Infinity War and Endgame. This is my favourite film in the M.C.U
Idk but this might be my favorite mcu trailer.
Rip asgard
Rip Moljnir
Thor 2011 Meh<br>Thor 2013 Bad<br>Thor 2017 BEST THOR FILM
❤
Feels like this was yesterday......🔥😱
Hotline miami song
Wow, they really gave away the whole movie in this trailer, huh
2
Hard to believe its been 4 years already
Did someone realize that The theme song  is from hotline Miami 2????
i wish they would do ultimate thor
More like &quot;Bore Ragnorok&quot;
After all this time, I still claim that the trailer&#39;s awful. They show Brunnhilde more than they show Loki whereas he plays an extremely important role in the entire story.
I don&#39;t care about this movie, but i like the hotline Miami 2 song
His hairstyle made him that much popular
Thor&#39;s eye
Among Thor, Loki and Hela, Loki is supposed to be the adopted one right? Let&#39;s see.<br>1)Loki and Hela both are primarily villains, one is loved, the other is not. Thor is a hero.<br>2)Loki and Hela both have their outfits primarily based on the color green. Thor wears silver, blue and red.<br>3)Loki and Hela both shouted, &quot;Kneel&quot; in a villainish way in The Avengers and Thor Ragnarok respectively. Thor never ordered his subjects to kneel.<br>4)Loki and Hela both have headgears with horns. Thor has headgear with wings.<br>5)Loki and Hela both have jet-black hair. Thor is blonde.<br>6)Loki and Hela both have a greedy desire for the throne of Asgard. Thor doesn&#39;t want the throne of Asgard.<br>7)Loki and Hela both are rather pale and have green eyes. Thor is not pale and has blue eyes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>ARE WE SURE THOR IS NOT THE ADOPTED ONE??????????
I can&#39;t believe this was 4 years ago
The lost eye is hidden in trailer✨️

Fire🔥🔥🔥☄️

Best Birthday Present from the MCU.<br>Thank you for this movie
bro this is the best trailer music I ever heard.
Happy birthday
The movie that I watched more than once
I can’t begin to imagine how funny Love and Thunder will be, what with the Guardians of the Galaxy being it. Can’t wait for May 6, 2022. 🤩🤩🤩🤩⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Still one of the if not the best marvel movie ever Taika Waititi need to direct more movies not just marvel movie but more movies in general
Yo
I wish  Hollywood would play a movie when fish in a  small room that has a fan blowing so it will know how low the movie is when laptop is on  High volume and while Diney Plus on laptop is high volume as well so they will know how low it really  is . All mumbling , so they could fix the volume .
YouTube recommended this to me after 4 years of this trailer. 🙂
Can&#39;t believe it myself still watching the trailer again, and again&quot;<br>Hands up boys who&#39;s here &quot;THOR&quot; fans, 🤒🖐🏼

I am marvel god of trailers
Who are here after watching loki finale
now i understand how hulk got into this planet, he was sucked into a portal in AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON, after he kill ultron he is in spaceship and he go to other universe.
I&#39;ve watched the movie 100+ times but still comes back to watch the trailer 😅...this still stands as the Best Marvel project
Most underrated movie of MCU..
