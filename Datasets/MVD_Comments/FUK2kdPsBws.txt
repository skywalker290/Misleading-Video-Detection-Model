Fast and furious: When the laws of physics don&#39;t apply 🌎
jhon cena
We&#39;re word family
i want the next movie to have time travel &quot;Back to the Fast and Furious&quot;. Just imagine that Dodge Charger with a Mister Fusion in front. If i&#39;m not asking to much, also an isekai spin off
throw it
what?
you wont see the arena tonight
Dumbest movie I&#39;ve watched
&quot;we&#39;re just going to be nice to them :D&quot;
The fast and furious is : the enemy will become friend in every next part , that’s it thanks
3 years already?!
If I wouldn&#39;t know the whole story this trailer would make me want to watch the movie
It&#39;s fun to see it in laf
I&#39;m 10 minutes in and my lord this movie is bad
A master thief, assasin, and high performance driver. Who is he? HE&#39;S JOHN CENA
Unnecessary movie that was made because of Vin Diesel&#39;s ego
Cena is so bad at acting 😂 he is the solo reason this movie didn’t do better and got cheek reviews from some
I was done with this Series Since FF6. But, this time I was watching this F&amp;F9 on Prime (Free with ADs) only no more than 7 mins . . . Just want to see how it is or Universal Pictures &quot;let&quot; them doing after 4-5 years that I&#39;ve been ignored it. <br>And, PEEPING really really? <br>Only  6 street racers with cars, bike, Glock 17/34, and Remington 870 and They destroy a whole army with AK47s, Military Vehicle, Helicopter fighters . . . <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a> It&#39;s a BIG f**c*ing joke here. More funny stuff, &quot;the shotgun dude&quot; goes on a secret mission crossing the border wearing a new clean WHITE t-shirt. WTF is that?.<br>It&#39;s just a big *uc*ing cartooning to FF script, screenwriters nowadays.<br>From Pro Street Racer became a Pro Secret &quot;Soldier&quot; team with No Need heavy weapons at all on their missions<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY"></a><br><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>
wow this is cool
OMG WTF just watched this befor i watch fast 10. Bad script, impossible stunts and shit acting. I feel bad for people who went to the cinema ro warch this looney tunes crap
I can take him
I blame the fans for allowing the franchise to keep disregarding the laws of physics, reality, and good script writing more and more each installment.  It is like the script writers asked &quot;how unrealistic do you want it&quot; and the producers simply answered &quot;Yes&quot;
This series was made to test how much bs they can get away with
This movie felt like watching a road runner cartoon, only cartoon was 2 hours shorter and more fun lol. Avoid and save 2 hours of your life for something smarter
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=103">1:43</a> “Cipher” looks really really cute with a short haircut!
For me Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are much better than John Cena
Sorry
This movie is tarah and bads movie in history
Not good
No good
It’s not a good movie
T to all about milking the cow to death. Awful movie
YOOOOOOOO SAMUEL KIM TRAILER MUSIC
Turned this shit off after a few minutes. This franchise is terrible.
They took fast and furious and just made it into a mission impossible movie so disappointing but I still watch them because my love for the first couple movies
This movie has some of the worst acting..Tyrese is absolutely unwatchable..it&#39;s hilarious that some street racers are now...... These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, If no one else can help and if you can find them. Maybe you can hire, The A-Team
Mission impossible 9, I means fast nine
My did they never say he had a brother in any of the other movies? Not even Mia mentions him.
This is getting old like a 65 year old man who wants to have his pension.
Stupid! 😅 Movies these days 😂

I think I&#39;m ready to replace the late Paul Walker who passed away 😊
When the car started swinging 😅😅
❤

Brother&#39;s?? They look nothing alike lol.
This movie has become super corny
who watches this garbage?
Wait, I forgot already, how is Han alive again lol??? Also, is this the one where they go into outer space?
Trailer was good nocap
Fast 11 is coming with Giant war

Lmao, what this franchise has become, literally watched the film last night, so now they jump of cliffs with cars and a jet picks them up, hilarious asf
Not going to watch it ..lost the roots from which they came from …..sucks 👎
This movie is so damn ridiculous it&#39;s beyond laughable!! Worst one of the franchise by a million miles!! DJ...you did yourself a favour bro by not being in this! 😂
I&#39;m struggling to decide if I liked this. I mean... they went to space. In a car.
This was unbelievably crap i have no words .....
We will miss that old classics fast and furious movies rip
Family&gt;physics
Don’t bother see this movie they mess everything nothing makes sense anymore,
I just finished washing fast and furious 17 and let me tell ya, it was just like the rest of them
After Fast X movie
Space is not real - earth is level / flat!!! YouTube Eric Dubay
They should take over the the international spa e station next..with a 77 transam.
Over the top..for sure all of em..what&#39;s next..multivsrse..dead pool saves em 😂..watchable..but completely stupid..space..like come on..12 year boys must love it lmao
Now after watching it I will be in psychological pain 🤕🤕 for two or more years waiting for the movie Fast X part 2
They sure know how to make a trailer these days, so I don&#39;t need to waste my time on the full movie 🥰
Fast and furious  ??? Why,didn&#39;t the last 7 of them suck enough ??? 😅
Beast version of 9
It&#39;s insultingly stupid to watch this shitshow. Where was this secret brother all these other 15 fast movies. He always wanted to be faster than Dom and yet Dom never even mentions him. I&#39;m sorry but these people want the viewers to accept whatever bs they come up with. Flying cars, flying people, impossible missions and stunts and never ending secret siblings.
Only if they could bring back Gisselle back to life in Fast X
Me just seeing fast 10 and then seeing fast and furious 9😬😅
I like the Fast and Furious series, but they really jumped the shark with this movie – driving through a minefield, driving across a collapsing bridge, the absolutely ridiculous bit  with the steel cable, and then they put the car in space. They couldn&#39;t have jumped the shark harder if they tried
Remember when Dom got scared when Brian saved him from the cops?
❤
Best movie forever
Komedija tapo jau
don got trigonometry up his sleeve while doing that cliff jump
Terrible, horrible movie, franchise is going worse and worse in every movie. Actors, director and crew should be ashamed for what they present

Paul tribute jus fk up,bcz of tis fking trilogy
OUR FATHER PRAYER CHANGED IN CHURCH MASS. BIBLE CHANGED. SWAFGSIGNES/D.2023.
my favorite part was when john cena(groots brother) said “ i do not fear the dark side as you do. i have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new empire.” and vin diesel replied with “i have family” 😍 such a brotherly bond moment.🙏👏🏼
This film is terrible same as alot of them, last decent on was Tokyo drift. So corny and cheesey. Bullets fly everywhere and none of the characters get hit, you can tell that it&#39;s acting does not emerse you into the film at all. And it&#39;s also bad acting. The amount of money wasted should of gone to charity. What a load of shit. They don&#39;t make films like they UST to. Can&#39;t believe the simps that would pay to watch it. Just watched the first 20 mins n had to turn off coz I can notice how fake it all is. Worst film ever!
Worse movie ever please dont watch it my head still hurts .
FF9 should sign up for DC or Marvel to give them superpower!
Marvel and DC are more realistic than this universe
Rewatched it on netflix..... The movie is so stupid, the law physics the law of death and even just common sense where ignored in this movie. Dom was stronger than thor, bryan is a stay at home dad while his wife fights bad guys, han is alive again, they go to outer space in a car, MAGNETS!!, i appreciate Tej saying faith is not a number (faith of furious) over all the movie is just cringed but I would still watch the next one because what the hell
The stupid family line is getting beyond stupid.
Too Fast for Aliens 11.

Without paul movie not Worth it the way that it was i don&#39;t know why its good but  the reality is that its simply doesn&#39;t matter how brilliant work they did but the absence of the Paul cant fulfilled men 🥺
Wtoomuchfunw
Terrible....this is turning into the Expendables but less famous actors....Paul love you man thank God you aren&#39;t a part of this clown show.....🙏🏼
WSWWS
Han appeared wat da heck? A lot of twist i dont understand the movie even if i do, i dont want want to understand..  the director is chinese? whre&#39;s hobb? For all the fast episode I saw this is far the worst.. vin diesel twin is kerosene..
WSWS
After every sequel i think &quot;it cant get any worse&quot; and every time i get proven wrong. This was actually a pretty good franchise the first 2 or 3 movies. But now its just comical how stupid this franchise has become.
nobody punches him in the guts to make sure he isn&#39;t a ghost? that&#39;s not family Dom
WHelloIAmALiveW2023W
I can&#39;t wait for Dom to go Super Saiyan in F10!🤦‍♂️
Is that the mafia
Without paul fast &amp; Furious  incomplete.
family &quot;Dom intensifies&quot;
Han comback
En esta película echaron a perder al Lucas black pensé que iba mostrar una escena de alguna carrera corriendo o algo así con torreto cómo en Tokio 😅y no me emocioné mucho pensé que iba ver algo de continuación sobre eso o algo de Lucas black y no 😊esperemos que en la 10 no arruinen al personaje de han en rápidos y furiosos 10❤
They reached orbit in this movie, maybe they&#39;ll reach the moon in Fast10
One of the boring worst movie in Hollywood
👎👎👎GOLDEN  RASPEBERRY 👎👎👎
A Oh MY! TRAILER SIGNED.
Movie about ratting on your brother lol
I liek your moves
Miss the old tokyo drift
didn’t get to see this movie, was it good ?
I am here only because john cena recommended it
To all the F&amp;F fans, lets just accept this bitter fact that F9&#39;s trailer was better than the whole movie...🙃
Jhoncena
Just end the franchise bruh, its not interesting anymore
Hahahaha now I&#39;m sure your direction in this series is to become an Indian comedy movie&#39;s... No wonder, Paul isn&#39;t there anymore
Family!!!
If only this movie was as good as this trailer was
Cena👑👑
rvfk
I swear to God this is THE worst movie in history fucking garbage
Yes some of the physics are unbelievable, well, every action scene actually and the crew are as invincible as always. The lines are cheesy af, with only a couple of funny ones from Roman, and many parts are predictable.<br><br>If you&#39;re in the right mood it&#39;s actually not too bad and actually quite funny in its absurdness. F &amp; F has always been cheesy af from the get go so I don&#39;t know why everyone is complaining.
F&amp;F ends for me in the 7th one.<br>Would have been on 6th but Deckerd Shaw saved it.
Such a good trailer, even better movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=212">3:32</a> imagine if PAUL enters like this.! with the same dialogue 😭I am not crying u r
What about the script? Who wrote that s**t?
Failed movies....
Vin(vehicle identification number)...gas type Diesel
Fun fact, this series is not a racing movie, but a superhero movie:<br>Vin Diesel as Bloohshot<br>Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman<br>Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam<br>John Cena as Peacemaker<br>Jason Momoa as Aquaman<br>Brie Larson as Captain Marvel
It&#39;s already 3 years? Wow, time so fast
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=193">3:13</a> when my brain cells fried
“…somehow Palpa, err Han returned.”
Its so sad the rock is not here<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>We just watched the rock vs john cena if the rock is here
Too much action not enough street racing. Stupid. Fast and furious was about street racing. not this action stuff.
3 Years
Fantastic mind blowing extraordinary 👌👌🍿
Terrible. Its like they want to suck at this on purpose.<br>Missing the real fast and furious.
I loved the beginning with nascar

I tried watching this last night. It was that bad my IQ was effected. What a pile of steaming shit !
What a pile of 💩 it’s not fast and furious as we know it, terrible
Honestly I hate this movie, when they started driving off a 100 floor building. I was done with them and their story.
Brian?
Come on everyone it’s just a movie everything isn’t real hahaha just remember it’s a movie my goodness everyone here want things to be real dumbass hahhaha
Fast 10: turns out Dom is Luffy’s mom
The Rock and John Cena had similar journey when you think about it. WWE, Fast and Furious and DCEU. What&#39;s next ? Marvel ? Rock as The Thing (Fantastic 4) and Cena as Collossus (X-Men) ?  🤣🤣🤣
the best of the franchise
Today&#39;s trailers are basically a summary of the whole movie.
This is gayer than aids
Goofiest movie I&#39;ve seen smh
I can’t see this brother they are talking about

I watched the 4th movie of fast and furious and letty was murdered and how is  she alive in number 9 with no explanation.
Man I wonder what the fuck they’re gonna do with fast 11
Certified Bing Chilling moment.
Dom: I don&#39;t have a brother <br>Director : no you have one you just don&#39;t know 🤣
The rock, Roman reigns now John Cena.. Who will be next ?  😂
I don&#39;t know how they made so many of these movies the first three were good the rest horrible
Fast 11: WWE Wrestlers has secrete mission to kill john cena and rock
This movie is garbage. 😂 Shame to the Director of this movie and to the concept of Death to New Life 😁😁
Worst super hero franchise to ever exist . What a dumpster fire this was .
Fast and furious 10 will be collab with Marvel and Dc heroes

Fast 10: Your Seatbelt
Guy&#39;s where can i watch this
I didn’t know it was possible to make such a horrible and cheese movie. If they didn’t have such famous/good looking people in it this would be a C rated movie.
Dom: I learned everything I needed to know about life on this track. <br>Kid: Is this where you learned to balance a check book and pay taxes.
I keep thinking there can’t be any worse movie in history than the last fast and furious movie. But then Vin goes and does it and makes the worst movie in history’s twin.

Fast &amp; Furious (2009) Mia: &quot;How can you say goodbye to your only brother?&quot; XDD biggest fail in movie history
You don&#39;t need a bridge when you have family
The new Grand Theft Auto trailer is amazing!
Am I the only one who thinks that it would be best to bring Gisele back in the 10th episode, I think that we, the fans, deserve
Fast 10 is going to be endgame, everyone is going to come back to fight a bigger threat that we&#39;ve ever seen. It will be a family reunion.
I think next tym they will gonna jump from heaven 😂
Director was mad this tym---<br><br>To stamp the brotherhood of dom and jacob they need to mention their bloodline was mixed 🥴<br><br>Most funny was when liya came to help while braine was on baby sitting 😂...i think he may not rest in peace while knowing this utter shit
I&#39;ve watched this trailer and I still don&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve seen this movie
why the fuck do you create your trailers in the way like that movie was already watched...
The 4th movie was the last good one.
In the year 2050, the FF franchise will be bought by Disney like everybody else and we&#39;ll find out that Dom is actually Thanos&#39; son. Letty is the secret third adopted sister of Nebula and Gamora whom Thanos took to be a wife for Dom. Han was snapped out of existence but brought back through the power of family and Brian and Mia were transported to a different timeline and Dom&#39;s son from the further future of a different universe has become the most dangerous villain and has to be put down by Dom who drifts on the rings of saturn to gain enough traction to perform a mega punch against his son to knock all the universes back in place and end the reign of tyranny
Always need that protection
Looks like a family movie.
Paul Walker substitusion with Justin Bieber ,her face same😎
The reason why Dom lived life a quarter mile at a time was because it was only during a drag race that he was free of responsibilities to his family. Having a family wouldn&#39;t stop him from living life a quarter mile at a time.
Fast&amp;Furious 9
F9 is Suck....one of the most bored movies from fast and furious movies sequel..
Word
No matter what anyone says, Vin diesel you&#39;re doing a Great job, we lost paul, he was a big part of the series, but you keep the story in its place, fast and furious was never a movie about just car&#39;s it has action, that&#39;s what the fast saga is, some of us are waiting without judging for fast 10, people with small mind&#39;s don&#39;t get movies because they don&#39;t love movie&#39;s, fast 9 was a bit weird but also it made sense. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fast10">#Fast10</a>
And to think all of this started with a tuna sandwich on white bread, no crust.

At this point Toreto would fuck up goku in his ultra instinct form<br><br>No way I was gonna watch this shit on the theater , and boiii was I right 😂😂😂😂😂
Not fast anymore, only furious
They need to do new movie with new actors something about street racing and talents like tokyo drift not this avengers stuff
Trash film so far for FnF

I laugh when a rock hit Dom and still survives and not injured
Jacob is Dom&#39;s brother.<br><br>We can&#39;t see him.
They’re just superheroes at this point and because no one says it this movie is superb comedy
Funny to see actors keeping that serious face throughout movie, doing idiotic things
The idiot producers ruined Fast &amp; Furious with ridiculous bullshit about flying cars in space, bringing people back from the dead and having Dom turn his back on family. The new movies SUCK! They&#39;ve basically become a cartoon comedy. The original is so much better...when it was about the cars not about superheroes saving the world from AI and james bond type villains... RIP Paul Walker...

Never be the same without pual walker.
The Fast and the Furious 1 and 2 is on a different universe.<br><br>3 and up are set on another universe.
Since it&#39;s a FAMILY movie, they should have added Kevin Hart to the movie 🎬 <br>For God&#39;s sake.. 😮‍💨
For the fast&amp;furious 10 and last chapter FF11. Please bring back Cody walker as a Brian O&#39; Conner
Guys did you hear the pianno song is just like song in see you agian song
Dumbest movie ever. Complete trash and comical at best. Ruined.

The man who always bragging about family is forget about his own brother.

What happened to Paul waller? I haven&#39;t seen him since fast7
Hai vợ chồng em Lộc và Thuy rất de thuong , Chuc hai em luôn luôn hạnh phúc nhé.

Puros comentarios PENDEJOS y nadie pone cual es el nombre del soundtrack de este trailer!!! 🫤
Chào ⭐⭐
Looking forward for the 10 im so excited about it..
Since Paul&#39;s passing, these movies have fallen staright off the cliff, I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be happy he got out when he did
Don&#39;t matter if a guy is an assassin, as long as he is USA side, he is seen as a hero
Han Lue comeback
The only thing I liked about this trailer was how the played see you again at the beginning for abt 10 seconds.
Tried watching this movie last night, man they DO NOT hit the same anymore<br><br>The last good one was 7, I lost interest and stopped watching 9 halfway through
Dom please CGI Brian forever. and thats my idea. no one can steal it!
Hans back niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This movie  sequel began to suck after Tokyo Drift.
F&amp;f10: Dom&#39;s cousin<br>F&amp;f11: Dom&#39;s distant uncle<br>F&amp;f12: Dom&#39;s gardener who is actually his step father<br>Finally..<br>Dom: i got no toilet paper. Cos i have a big family!
Tej says oh hell no just like Orange Julius
yk it’s a han entrance when he got a badass supra wit em, RIP RX7 tho:(
Whenever I hear those piano notes it makes me sad
🗿
Cant wait for Fast and Furious 10.
Idk what’s wrong with me but I keep watching this movie
Noone remembers the story of him beating the guy half to death over his dad an he talks about his brother saying it was him screaming
Truly the worst one I&#39;ve ever seen maybe the worst film I&#39;ve ever seen and what the hell has happened to the actors<br>I forgot how to act. I can see why Dwayne Johnson left  this one to original people
They said Dom has a brother but I cannot see anyone in this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=66">1:06</a>  Gun is automatically rising and shooting  on it&#39;s own
Need for Speed: Teacher&#39;s return. Сartoon type - Computer-generated imagery.
Feel the Love by KIDSEEGHOST Lol
Best bgm
remember when the climax of the first movie was stealing a truck? now you have people ressurecting, cars with parachutes, jumping through sky scrapers, and even burning alive a main actor. what is going on?
Why is Dom so grown in 84 at da race wen we all member. Him being a lil kid that’s a Dud lmpao
Laws of physics exist :<br><br>Fast and furious : we don&#39;t do that here .
There was talk about jurassic world and fast and furious crossing over. <br><br>Dom: These Dinosaurs are strong. But not as strong as family!!
Been a huge fan ever of fast and furious. and I still binged watching the movies over and over. BUT after I watched fast 9, all I can say is that only the trailer got you more excited. I&#39;m sorry. Kinda disappointed with the effects and the story. It&#39;s not a Fast&amp;Furious-ish thing.<br><br>Spoiler Alert! = on the last part? it seems like this is not the end of the fast and furious. I think fast 10 is coming.
han is back... brian pls be back also😭
Teacher: name a device where physics is not involved <br>Me: F9 hold his physics
Not in our cinema, flop flop
Flop film
FF9 was horrible. Car in space? Seriously? Script was awful- the writer(s) should be placed on a blacklist &amp; banned from Hollywood permanently.
6 on 10...it is OK but the worst since the number 4.I like Cena.
Fast 10 we gotta fight aliens with cars
i thought letty gonna join the team.. and dom gonna join too..<br>letting the kid alone at the home for a long time<br>die dry like an anchovy<br><br>but no
I think the funnier thing is Dom rebuilding the same car 87 times
R.I.P Fast &amp; Furious
yaryt alflm kaml 😍❤️❤️
Don &gt; goku<br><br>They should just make fast’n ur seatbelts a joke movie where they use explore the multiverse to fight saton’s exiled long lost step cuisin. And thanos <br><br>Since dom does solo every verse with family
this movie was about cars right ?
MF don&#39;t even wear the seatbelt while that car was in mid-air
From street thug car jockeys to international spy&#39;s to astronauts and even brought back characters from the dead ! They must have gotten the writers from 1980s General Hospital to come out of retirement 😂😂😂 the next movie will be &quot;THE FAST AND THE PAST &quot; DOM GOES BACK IN TIME TO HELP START THE PONY EXPRESS
Y&#39;all remember back before F&amp;F was a science-fiction movie? When it was about racing?
Spoiler: DON XUO FEI CHANG HAO 🤭🥶🍦
Fast 11: diesel has another secret brother but hes retared and hes called electric (like electric cars)
suddenly ff become new avengers HAHAHAHA..
I feel Cringed...
What happened to tge college kid in tokyo drift? Serious question
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=62">01:02</a> I automatically remember Yugyeom when I heard the song. ✌
Miss you Brian😓
I’m so ready for Han’s comeback but the question is how did he survived in Tokyo Drift?
This movie is so good
The worst ff ever. I laughed my ass out watching it lol😂😂😂
Can&#39;t wait to see Wakanda recruiting Dom for the next black panther
bruh idk why but this trailer got me dead just thinking bout the old f&amp;f🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thats some stupid movie🤣🤣🤣.cartoons for kids
&quot;I will always be in your heart&quot;....what a cocky fuck.
Worst movie ever
&quot;Presented to you by Bing Chilling&quot;
who is the guy in the last clip of the  movie with a blue Nissan GTR? fuck I&#39;m curious
Producers: Who will write the script for fast 9?<br>His 3 yr old son: Dada Dada...meeeeeeee
CIA, US Army ❌<br>Dom and friends ✅
Btw movie was cool but man what had sean become the drift king he deserved better 😢
Fast and the furious needs a reboot
Fast, furious, and fatuous farting.
they cops cant see john cena beacause you cant see him
are you kidding me? how is Han back? so are they bring back his girlfriend Gisele (played by Gal Gadot)????
Whataaaaa faccccccckkkkk
The movie was awesome ❤️
This comment section is amazing
Physicist : Hey Dom, tell me a joke.<br>Dom: once upon a time there was physics....<br>Physicist: lololololololololololololol ROLF.
F&amp;F 15: Tom &amp; Jerry, Popeye, Spongebob join the team. 99% cartoon, 1% logic
When the stunts get THAT stupid, WTF?!   (Still a fun flick)
🤦🏻‍♂️ more zombie pills for the stup!d
This whole trailer be like:<br>Ratatatatatatatatata

I fucked this garbage, half a tank was eaten by the janitors fell into the pussy, the pussy was anointed and licked with a herring, and fuck you, you jump on a hard dick and the mood is lively
This the goofiest f&lt;ckin movie bro💀💀💀💀
Guys who is the “master thief, high performance driver”??<br>Can only see empty cars….
For the love of god can someone please explain why they keep changing gears in an automatic car?
Fun fact: Dom’s brother was in all the fast and furious movies, we just couldn’t see him
F9 is last one movie 🤩🏁🏎
ff9 is all about the memes
Coooool
Remember when Fast and The Furious was about street racing?
Just watched this pile of shit... it&#39;s so bad
Fast 10: Doms’ brother’s brother Esau, returns from the dead and goes against the family
I think the best idea for FF10 would be : Dom found out that he have a twin brother and he is Xander Cage.
The creator of this should be arrested for making such a bad movie
bruh Zhong Xina
ching billing
Started watching the series from first movie and now that i know about Brian , most of the dialogues just hits so hard and the whole meaning of the family in the movie and the relationships among them changes. I really am enjoying . Do try watching them from starting again.
Can&#39;t wait when Cena calls in reinforcement, Bumblebee
Click the like button dude&#39;s
dude driving car for even 100km/hr races my heart .....but these guys what are they even doing
Oooooh man super
Bro... I saw this in my watch later,then now its been a year!?
To all of marvel&#39;s 2021. ff9 you stomped it out of the stadium. But you didn&#39;t take venom carnage, because it&#39;s also fighting. It&#39;s worth watching the 9 movie marathon but for now.
So glad i didnt waste a single cent for this crap. FF is destine to crash with this crap overdo storyline. Shud hv stop at part 3 &amp; become a classic. So wasted
Fast and Furious 11 will be Dom &amp; Cena fighting in mars
Bing chilling
Some scenes deleted on the original film??
Why cant I see doms brother
I&#39;ve watched this movie..it was about Family..i think there were cars too but I&#39;m not sure
Um this series have no point and boring dom driven to bridge then get hooked its robe then start swinging that&#39;s why Hollywood ded business and every series is the damn same bad guys dom finish them then family gather at dinner table and a kiss and the movie is over they all the same
first 15 min and im out
What next? Fast 10 will be in marvel sequels? And after that try to conquer the galaxy?
It has become a computer game and not a movie! Everything is forgery and exaggeration
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=60">1:00</a>
Spoilers.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Soo many scenes are cut why?
<b>...Fast 10 better be called...</b><br><b>...Fast 10 your seat belts...</b>
Everyone: trolling the trailer<br><br>I am just happy to see Han again
Besides all the jokes and shit. The movie was amazing, definitely worth watching 😊
I know Fast &amp; Furious movies are dumb but goddamn, this movie is the dumbest shit i&#39;ve watched this year.
Taiwan is an independent nation.
Amazing
for those who still haven&#39;t watch this movie, prepare yourself because at the end of the movie, you will be questioning a lot about it <br><br>SPOILER<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1. hans death, he never explain how the hell he survive the crash, he just said mr. nobody had nifty trick, when i first watch it i was like, what?<br><br>2. how the hell roman survive a group of soldiers shooting at him from all sides, i mean he was surrounded, even if he was wearing a bulletproof vest, one or two bullet should really hit his head<br><br>3. roman conveniently find the reason why the couldn&#39;t track jacob because he didn&#39;t like the delivery guys (jakob henchman in disguise) just because he didn&#39;t like them<br><br>4. the whole thing brother vs brother was because their dad playing favorite with dom and jakob being a jealous boy<br><br>the only thing i enjoy about this movie was when letty and the rest fight in tokyo (it was not amazing but pretty good imo) and roman break the 4th wall about how they survive the impossible and live to tell about it
Fast 8 : dwayne pulling a flying helicopter with one hand<br>Fast 9 : after watching this trailer i think Dom can join the avengers to save the world
Is this gta 6 trailer
Family
i know a guy that has real pokemon and a holographic koloa beer he name Fred Black thank you
Like See you again😅❤️
One thing i did like in the movie, the skyline at the end
This is not a meme anymorr
It&#39;s a long trailer yeah?
Please someone help me with this full movies... Please
han still gothis fav design lol
Paul walker wouldn&#39;t have let it get like this may his soul rest in peace
I should have stopped watching F&amp;F when it was good at no 3 maybe. FF9 is pure garbage.

You guys need to put more racing and your movies
Wb gisele??
I just found out they made fast 9 and 😑
DAYM
I actually like how they throw little elements from F7 in the movie, especially the soundtrack.
probably one of the worst movies ever made
Cena,Brian,dom,and, little,Brian vs a whole government
Easily the #1 dumbest movie of the year. My wife and I walked out after laughing at the bad writing of the &quot;serious parts&quot; and rolling our eyes through the entire movie. The only way to enjoy the movie is to Treat it like a really cheesy &quot;B&quot; movie. You know, the ones that are so bad, that they are funny parody of themselves.
Time?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=215">3:35</a> WAAAT???? HAN IS ALIVE?
THE STROY WAS NOT THAT GOOD ACTION ARE SUPERB REQUEST TO MAKE THE LIKE FF5

Fast and Furious 10:Dom fighting against  Taliban in Afghanistan
where’s the “bad guy”
They said Jacob is dom’s brother <br><br>Who is Jacob ??! I never seen Jacob introduced in this movie
No I&#39;m not fan of this type of fast and furious fucking hell this was ....like witching A sci fic + animation like 😂😂
Finale of F&amp;F : Dom is helped by captain marvel and Rey Skywalker  to beat jar jar binks<br>..........<br>FOR FAMILY
this is absolutely  shit
ফুল ঢপের চপ বারা
Im happy that my grandchildren will see f&amp;f  5.000 what will happen till then
WORST STORY OF F&amp;F..
There is not an inch of reality in this movie, but I still went to watch because of their emphasis on one word &quot;family&quot;!
the next episode, palpatine invade the world and kill someone at the family, dom get revenge, just the time; winnie the poo and tiger do drag race at death star
Can&#39;t wait for this comes out on DVD and Blu-ray 11th October I think 👍😎
I can’t watch this bull shit ….this is so bad…0,1/10 maybe for 5 year old child but I think they say the same …I don’t even want to finish this movie worst movie in my life
You go in for the fast and furious but you&#39;ll get avengers/gravity!...  ..<br><br>Duck tapes... Honda; rocket engine.. Space..  Seriously people! And WTF is wrong with John Cena his baby face and doms bone head really worked in this one...  At least women cast helped buried the movie..   And Charlize you have a jet and you launched missile at them. .. but decided to go check it out...  And got slammed in face ..   I wonder why rock would&#39;ve done if he was in the cast..😂😂
Honestly don&#39;t know wether to watch it or not. Looks a bit to far fetched.??
The Raw of the Furious: 2021<br>The Fast Smack Down: 2022
F1-F4: NEED FOR SPEED &amp; GRAN TURISMO<br><br>F5-F9: TWISTED METAL &amp; MAD MAX<br><br>there no words.
FAST &amp; FURIOUS 9 STORY REVIEW-<br>Dom Toretto is living the quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, but they know that danger always lurks just over the peaceful horizon. This time, that threat forces Dom to confront the sins of his past to save those he loves most. His crew soon comes together to stop a world-shattering plot by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they&#39;ve ever encountered -- Dom&#39;s forsaken brother.. this movie&#39;s story line is really awesome...❤️
I guessed that Jacob was dons brother it’s just so dry and bad
Isse achha trailer salmon bhai ki film ki hoti hai😂
Family

Wow I didn&#39;t know this franchise has 9 Gears😂
This franchise is no longer about car racing..lol
When  official release in india
I miss the times when Han was just a business man who had a badass RX-7, a big garage full of japanese gems and a &quot;firend&quot; related to the Yakuza, now that dude is like a damn hitman trained by John Wick
FF69= Dom fights his super villain great great grandchildren.<br>Scriptwriter: Wait, shouldn&#39;t he be dead by then?<br>Dom: Who needs to die when you got Family!!
For you guys who complaining why fast and furious its not look like its about cars anymore, pay attention to the name its &quot;Fast And Furious&quot; Not &quot;Fast Car Racing&quot;
nice
Cena&#39;s face expression r exactly incridible
Easily one of the shittiest movie ever
They weren&#39;t joking when they said this movie was for the whole family
I miss brian
How many times can you keep driving a race car around and keep making up a bunch of different scenarios to keep racing around this shit is ridiculous garbage
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=90">1:30</a> And his name is John cena........ 😂😂😂
Please change the story writer and appoint someone with common sense. Please stop already with the &quot;world saving thing&quot;. Go back to the basics and please let it be a good  story. If you haven&#39;t realised yet please know that, ff9 is a Joke. For your information, putting a whole lot of ⭐ s on the same screen do not make a good movie.
The Adams FAMILY on STERIODS
Felliniesque
F10 The Miz Vs Dom
how will they explain the Han return?
Remember when this series about cars.
just watched it
Trash... what started as realistic underground street racing is now a a non-realistic hollywood fest of ridiculous stunts through the woods...<br>There´s nothing Fast and Furious about this... After Rob Cohen and John Singleton masterpieces, this franschise went down the toilet. Seriously, how can a car ride through a falling bridge... or swingon a hooked rope... Gary Scott Thompsons masterpiece has been raped.
Same old plot, nothing new I guess they shud just stick to street racing will have been better then this. <br>Same old long lost bad brothers, cousins, friends who was there for years but just turned up now after 8 movies and then turns good.<br>Same old bio weapon crap, which falls in the bad hands. <br>Dom almost dies in every movie, comes back alive saves people&#39;s using just his car and taking on a jet or a drone at the end. <br>Won&#39;t the directors use the brains to think something out of the same box? <br>Not the damn car going to out of space kinda thing though, that was just plain stupid.
Ff12 dom and family race with zombies
It&#39;s always about family.
Trash 9
No magnets were harmed making this movie.
Dom is always know what is demanding ...
Letty: There’s no bridge!<br>Dom: Bridges?….Where we’re going we don’t need bridges. We only need family
I just watched fast 1...and you guys went waaaay too far...this was movie about car parts, illegal races,nitro sport cars etc....this turned out to real bullshit...
Tyrese Gibson(Roman) lines always makes me laugh 😅
Ok bashing on how the series is now  ridiculously stupid but Han turned up in a mfkin veilside liveried Supra
This looks like a South Indian Tamil movie with English dubbed where cars  fly all over and the heroes are bulletproof , gravity doesn’t matter anymore 😂
DAMNNN ye kab aa gayiiii 😍😍😘😘👌👌🔥🔥😍😍
I loved all of the movies because of their unique actions.. but this one was headache
This time they crossed all the limits of Science. They should really stop making more parts of this franchise.
is time to stop, ff 10 is not necessary
F10, they get back to their roots and just fucking race cars. JK!
AS A TRUE FF FAN, WORS MOVIE EVER!!
Ty ff
എന്ത് ശോക പടം ആണ്....
Good film I like this film, this film is my favorite. I&#39;m from Indonesian 🇮🇩
Fast 10 :your seat belts
Is there anything else apart from dumb unrealistic stunts ??
They should really stop this stupid series now
Can someone tell me what that song was?

<b>Wow the trailer and the movie is completely different!</b>

john cena
mad skill..
Comments are just fucking hilarious 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
This is fucking parody of a movie. 👎👎👎<br>I don&#39;t recommend it to anyone. It&#39;s definitely made for stupid people from stupid people
I am groot
The series of F&amp;F after what, part 3-4 has took a twist that lost it completely. Wtf did I watched, I didn&#39;t even finish it. I stop where they were shooting at each other and driving around with no give a damn physics, the bridge part was where I lost it and stop streaming. <br>Hey atleast it&#39;s about family, from what I heard.
poo
hahahaha  from a street racer to world savior.he&#39;s going places.ive decided to just stop going to see a movie when its about special effects,or a movie that can be explained with 2 sentences.
Looking Roman and Tej back from space, thats mean FF10 will meet Guardians of galaxy at Megatron place to fight Baphomet
I never thought I would watch Fast and the Furious after Paul died.. but I did just watched F9.. And I cried when I saw the blue skyline at the end.. I hope Paul Walker will be honored in the next FF.. By returning his Brian to this awesome frenchise..
How&#39;s the movie guys? Is it worth watching bcoz iv not watched yet.... please help
Wow the trailer is so amazing
This is just pure cringe
FAMILY
what in the fuck has fast and furious even become.....
Welp Han is back but how is he alive after the  explosion of the Mazda that was crashed by Shaw?
Its pretty hard to defeat a thief that is practically invisible
This movie is like a modded race in gta online
Family

Batman vehicles, into the future car, jumanji Island, avengers spaceship, cars swinging like Spiderman....<br><br><br>Wow<br><br>Fast and furious 👍🏻
Logic is no more...
How to dub hindi language this movie??
fast 10: Ja Rule finally gets Monica
Jacob is doms brother wtf... That&#39;s soo lame!
enough of Family meme.I am tired of this meme.
The most boring film i have ever watched.
THIS WAS REALLY BAD LIKE REALLYYY TRASH not joking at all i mean wtf. The Avengers + Xmen wouldnt even be able to manage the shit i saw.. i mean even being too muhc has its limits... but wathcing a fucking ford in space is jsut stupid. I mean their Acting were never the strong thing here so.. jezz the cringe
&quot;protection, from what&#39;s coming&quot;...please don&#39;t be a 10th fast and furious movie
T R A S H!
I lost interest in it once Paul died its just not the same anymore and when they used Paul&#39;s brother in the end of the movie, like why? Seems like they were bring back everyone that died in the show.
without Paul walker I can&#39;t satisfy and u 🥺❤️
Watching this trailer almost put me to sleep, can&#39;t imagine what the movie will do.
Now this is looking like a proper south indian movie
2 fast 2 furious and tokyo drift are the best fast and furious movies made ever, and guess why ? because this bald headed fuck shit diesel does not apear in them.
How did we came here from truck chasing
BING CHILLIG
Dom always says that family is everything but he forgets his own brother his own flesh..🤭🤭
What&#39;s the music used ?

This saga should&#39;ve ended at Fast Five

And yet this movie ticket sales surpass their budget. Fast 10 coming soon.
In F10 Dom’s dad survived the crash and is rebuilt as a cyborg. He also has an Alien army on Mars
Most awaited
The begin
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=113">1:53</a> that&#39;s Natasha and Yelena
POV: You came back after seeing the movie and take the differences from the movie to the tralier
Paul Walker saw this shit and made a quick exit
Gee, some way-out stunts and special effects in this film. But the thing i find to be the MOST unbelieveble, is that pudgy latte-boy Vin Diesel could last 2 secs fighting John Cena !!
At this point they should be fighting the avengers
Bitches were the main reason why men fought with each other for years!
Who missed PAUL WALKER In fast &amp; furious 9 like &amp; comment

dom in f20 - One last ride
Fast and ferious is far more better than marvel
Hurry up an make it rentable you lazy fuckers
I&#39;ve never laughed so hard at a trailer
Thanos: &quot;I am inevitable&quot;<br>Dom: &quot;I am Groo- Family&quot;
Did these mfs just revive Han
Horrible movie 👎🏾👎🏾
And they said John Cena is in that movie.....i didn&#39;t see him in the trailer!
Its a flimsy rope...supporting the weight of a car.Never change FF.
Modern family requires anti gravity solutions
Wow, they really went all out on the bullshit.with this one, huh? Not even trying anymore.. Just make up shit as they go along.. Fucking tragedy..
F &amp; F 100, Dom turns super saiyan and finally defeats Frieza.
Thanos: I am Inevitable <br><br>Dom: And I.. am.. GROOT! <br>Oops wrong movie!
this movie is looking like an average gta session.
The Fast and the Furious movies coming out every 2 years just like the PlayStation or Xbox game called Need for Speed they are keeping it up with the time and the year not what the movie will it be like good or bad Let’s just make it who cares….. Fast and furious today it’s not like part 1 was it will never be a lot of fake flying around cars like BATMAN’s NO THANKS…
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZzn0ZlQ3-k">https://youtu.be/DZzn0ZlQ3-k</a>
They really lost their minds with these movies
Superb trailer 👌
One biggest person was missing ❤️❤️❤️
Lots of fakes. First Dom cannot defeat John Cena. Lol..., no wait for a second in fast 5 he defeated Rock🤣🤣🤣 , and now he is gonna defeat Cena who&#39;s next Usos or New day rock.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=53">0:53</a>: I have got to say, I can&#39;t say I saw that coming.
Can’t wait to see fast and the furious 92
NFS Underground to Asphalt 9, i miss the good old days from Tokyo Drift. This movie is getting unrealistic
They should&#39;ve ended with Furious 7. You could already see that with the 6th and 7th installments, the franchise was losing some gas and was less engaging, but it still had enough action/stunts, which were balanced between the amazing ones and the totally unbelievable ones. Plus it still had some heart and was engaging enough. Plus with the death of Walker, the climax of Furious 7, and closing of the plotlines, it seemed like a great emotional cap-off to the franchise. <br><br>But no, they had to ruin it and rehash it into the ground until it became a repetitive, unbelievable and stupid pile of trash. I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t watch the 8th one (I just saw couple of nonsensical scenes to confirm my suspicions of the quality of the film). I obviously won&#39;t watch the 9th one either, other than couple of action scenes which will highlight to me the drastic and massive dip in quality, and also so that I get some laughs. Won&#39;t bother with the spin-offs either. They seem shit as well.<br><br>This franchise ended with the 7th one for me internally.<br><br>Even if (and that&#39;s a huge &#39;if&#39;) they go back to doing what they&#39;re best at i.e., street racing, friendship stuff and heists, I&#39;m not sure how much it&#39;ll reinvigorate my interest because they totally ruined this franchise by firstly, overusing a good character like Hobbs, who was a superb complimentary character in Fast Five. The major reason for me however is that they shat all over the emotional and storytelling aspects of the previous films. Han&#39;s death felt real in Tokyo Drift, and therefore you could relate to the feels in the 6th movie. It also made Giselle&#39;s death feel more because you know in advance that Han&#39;s not going to make it either, in the near future. But no, f**k you audience, and f**k your emotional investment. Han&#39;s back alive, Shaw can do whatever he wants without consequences, and heck that too with Hobbs accompanying him. If they hadn&#39;t done all this shit, transitioning back to what they did best would still have been easier and would&#39;ve gotten more involvement from me and the audience. This is another reason why they should&#39;ve ended with the 7th one coz Paul&#39;s character&#39;s retirement would&#39;ve meant that the sun would&#39;ve set on their crew since he was a pivotal member of their lives. But they&#39;re just continuing stuff just like that, paying lip service homages to him.
What’s that background song? I can’t fucking find it and it’s irritating me lol
WHAT HOW TF DID YOU GO TO SPACE DOM!?!?!?!?!? &quot;family.&quot;
And where is brain o corner only wife acted or what?
First The rock , now John cena, who’s next?? Rey mysterio !!??<br>Maybe fast furious 20 will be in a WWE fighting ring….with cars parked outside…..
Anyone know the song from this trailer?
Remember when their biggest challenge was to steal parts from a truck driver?
FaF went from realistic shit to spaceX type shit
And his name is.. JOHN CENA
Nah that bridge scene 😂😭🧢
the car doesn&#39;t tear apart when they used that rope thingy

Didnt see much cars
Fast and Furious eventually gets Dom into accidental space travel, where he ultimately becomes Riddick. He has no recollection of his past, and embarks on all the mercenary and criminal activities that would eventually lead to his capture, and take us straight into the movie Pitch Black. It is, at this point, we find out that all the Fast and the Furious movies were the prequel to Pitch Black.
Yea, not going to lie. These movies have gotten pretty dumb. Big fan of the first 3 but after that, they just got dumber and dumber!! Why don&#39;t you just have them in the next Avengers movie?!!
Worst thing they did for me in this Trailer was show Han that was the best part about this movie. I&#39;m never going to watch an FF trailer before the movie again. What person thought that is a good idea? I preferred when the team were thieves and not super heroes.
Bus undertaker aur aa jaye 😂😂
Since they are bringing back the old cast of FF movies will they bring back Bow Wow?
Big brother&#39;s always care about their young 1s.<br>But if u start fucking with him.<br>He&#39;s gonna smack ur asss up.
this trailer gave me goesbumps
I hear a voice but i cant see shit
This went from racing to a Micheal bay movie.
Disappointing 😞
I just watched the movie.. it was soo good . Punto.
Damn that song makes me sad asf
Fast 11 they find out the vehicles they were driving the whole time were the autobots and now have to team up to,fight the decepticons
Cannot wait to see this movie, this weekend!  I have loved Vin Diesel from the first time I seen him in Pitch Black.  Whoop, whoop!
Dom: I&#39;m gonna race on the streets and earn money<br><br>Storyline: oh you wish 🤣
dam this looks like pure fudge :(
This looks so bad....
People need to see the entertainment in the movies. Its suppose to be fun
This looks stupid and I love it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=72">1:12</a> did he stopped a flying car?
I can&#39;t wait for Fast10 Your Seatbelts: When Darth Vader, who doesn&#39;t have a family shows up on Earth and the Fast Family has to team up with the Avengers and Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League Family by using car engines and the power of family to create an interdimensional portal to the Phineas And Ferb universe and using Agent P&#39;s power of family to beat Darth Vader. In the end The Flash gives a family pep talk to Darth Vader and defeats him, and Darth Vader starts a family with Michael Scott and the Dunder-Mifflin Family, who are also glad that they could come. Also that&#39;s what she said.
I legit believe they go through the comments and pick the most ridiculous ideas for the next movies
Moral of the franchise is family
Hey Only 1 man can have sex God is The Devil<br>They killed the first man God to sleep with his 100megatron Goddess/Women<br>i god has black sons so i kiss my black sisters Goddesses<br>They kidnap god sisters<br>Man is God Heaven<br>Girl is Angel Heaven<br>Man is Deamon Hell<br>Girl is Goddess Heaven<br>Man is Devil Hell<br>Girl is Satan Hell<br>We kill chickens right? Kill is a powerful word Power is everything<br>We eat the dead chickens we kill. Kill every man has sex with god sisters<br>Kill everyone in hollywood that kiss god sisters
So ya‘ll are going to the rainbow road now?
Dont try this at home
Day by day the series is becoming a kids show..<br>I like it when fast and furious was about cars and races.
Vin for all time 💥
How TF we go from Fast and the Furious to the Avengers 😂
excuse me WHAT?!, han is supposed to be dead
Please go back to the roots @Universal - illegal car racing and no more 3rd world war stuff!!!
This movie sucks
These movies have been a joke yeeears ago now they’re just ridiculous lol
AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA BUM BUNDANOWW
Next fast and furious 10 teaming up with avengers !
Next movie: fast and furious 10 heading to mars !
Star wars joined the chat !
I stopped watching these movies after 6
Are you kidding me. They might as well say... RACER X IS SPEES RACERS BROTHER!!!
This franchise needs Mark Walberg lol
Fuck this franchise, use to be good,now it&#39;s just some scifi shit
People actually enjoy this? A car hooked to a rope swinging 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This movie was terrible
Did this man just catch a fuckin car ummmmm why did they turn them into super heroes
I didn’t know the fast and furious drivers  were a bunch of gun wielding assassins
So safe to say this franchise has became the pg13 film adaptations of Saints Row
I can’t wait for F15!!
Ya parece novela
Where is the rock 🗣️
This looks like fire so hot.
I can&#39;t wait to see this
honestly this movie was insane and great.
Someone make a NFS series so these guys can lose money because it&#39;s not about street racing anymore, it just became retarded. I don&#39;t even bother to watch any of these since F&amp;F 4 came out.
I&#39;m only watching this cr.@.p for Ngannou.
I can&#39;t wait to see when they introduce goku as dom&#39;s long lost cousin.
Were is the Rock i am not seeing the Rock?!?
Cardi b?
F&amp;F10 should include: Dominic Toretto, Jakob Toretto (if he isn’t dead, as of right now I haven’t seen F9 so idk), Luke Hobbs, Deckard Shaw, and maybe even the resurrection of Brixton Lorr (don’t know if that is possible but i think he was just the most badass villain ever) and just have them all in the same movie together whether it be as one team, two different teams, or against one another. The point is it would be the most testosterone-filled movie of all time
I’ve grown to really dislike Vin Diesel’s character. He’s just so uncharismatic and the dialogue and action isn’t even realistic anymore
I dont hate these movies anymore. They&#39;ve embraced the memes. They make me laugh more than most comedy movies tbh. They actually went to FUCKIN SPACE. What a bunch of legends. This entire franchise is just a meme and I love it.
Keep milking and ruining the franchise, jesus christ.
This is the dumbest shit I&#39;ve seen all year
what&#39;s the name of the music trailer?
This shit is so fucking stupid💀💀💀gonna see it anyways
Han
It’s so sad how it’s not even about cars anymore
Meadow walker if vin is bringing her in as a cameo maybe she can be brian daughter like mia said 2 kids one boy one girl GIRL MEADOW THINK ABOUT IT
Gay as fuck !!!!! <br>And they showed the whole fucking movie in the clip! Lol
F&amp;F 10 doms girl friend drinks my seamen for the rest of her life and loves milking the winnie 35times a day begging for every drop
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo glad I stay outside the room when trailers are on so I don&#39;t see them... everything suprising was in here!  I saw the poster walking out (not looking at it when I go in)... and a surprise was on the poster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so many action scenes on the poster too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Such a great movie, I was the only one to &quot;whoop&quot; when I saw him... no wonder why!!!!!!!!!!!   I was the only one who didn&#39;t know he was gonna show up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Perhaps IMDB would give it away, but I stay away from spoilers, but there was so much that woulda spoiled it for me.  I like not knowing.  Good primer for not being too serious though, I was nervous that it was a little too cartoonish like the jump across the gorge which I enjoyed (I go with it, make believe, thank God He honors it)
I absolutely can’t wait to see the f/9 I’ve seen all the others and enjoyed every one of them Paul walker will always be loved and missed by many may he rest in heavenly peace He is and always will be a part of fast and furious because it all about family it’s sad that he passed so soon however he will always be us because legends never die and he was just that he left his mark on this world and those he loved
Next movie they will resurrect Gal Gadot&#39;s character becuz turns out she was Wonder Woman and the airplane engine wasn&#39;t strong enough to kill her.
Fast and Furious 10: We follow a crack team of cops whos job it is to arrest these absolute lunatics who are causing millions of dollars in damage to infrastructure and property
This movie was great!!
Dom&#39;s dnt know how many brother he has and how many wife and childrens so complicated
Isaac newton got his ass kicked in this movie.
Fast and furious 11: Dom breaks into the multiverse using a car and saves the universe using family
JUST LET IT END
Why is dom talking to air the whole movie?
Letty: There’s no bridge!<br>Dom: Bridges?….Where we’re going we don’t need bridges.
This is getting to a point where nonsense looses it&#39;s meaning. Pathetic , they have out run there screen time just end this crap
nice g
Here&#39;s a plot for Fast 10: Dom and team fight the Chinese owned Virology Lab and their associates for the COVID-19 antidote.

plssss i beg whoever tf making these movies to stop.. this is what happens when a great franchise turns to in embarrassment, most the actors literally have no other revenue and these movies have been on a downward spiral .. that’s it that’s my rant
Laws of gravity.<br>F&amp;F9: what&#39;s that?
Han being resurrected and shaw being buddies with hobbs and dom now shits on the whole furious 7 movie.<br>As far as im concerned furious 7 is the end of the series for me, 8 and 9 are cut content, Hobbs and Shaw is DLC
Who misses pual walker
Never watching this shit, due to cardi b being in it
Fast and furious franchise should be straight to dvd now but since it’s name it goes In Theaters

<b>JUSTICE IS COMING</b><br><br>No it didn’t, they did my boy dirty
These several years, i have to avoid spoilers by not watching trailer. Trust me you&#39;ll have better sensation😂
I see no cars but tanks and guns??
It&#39;s like they are making each of the spoof movie posters at the end of 22 Jump Street into a movie.<br>FF 9: Vin Diesel fights his Brother John Cena<br>FF 10: They both search for their long lost adopted brother Bautista who&#39;s serving the Russian soviet<br>FF 11: The world is under attack by their stepfather Mark Henry and the 3 sons stop it .........
Boy, this is even stupider than I expected.
Wth, fast and furious was a lot better with Paul in it, now that he&#39;s not in it they have changed it big time.
I may have liked 8, but this is just a hell no from me
It’s almost time I can’t wait
So no one else noticed Sean

John Cena: Damn my brother is strong <br>Dom: my name is Goldberg.
Always Dom And Cena waiting This Movie...😎😎💖❤
Will watch just for han
It&#39;s so Badassssssss! Bro just so excited for it to release!
Please stop making these God-awful films.
God awful. I&#39;ve never seen a single F&amp;F movie, and judging by this atrocity I&#39;m glad that I never did.
Edinburgh Scotland seems to be in the movie. Super.
What the hell
the fuck is that
han is the most unique and intelligent character :)
This shit is so dumb lol
F&amp;F ( Fly &amp; Fun )10
I never knew Some family movie would be like this
Whats next space🍊
I would refuse to do these movies I mean then again I would like the easy payday but my God how they have completely ruined the Fast &amp; Furious franchise. I remember the good old days when unrealistic was simply the floor pan flying off from too much nitrous but all of this is ridiculous. All the CGI and bullshit. what happened to the realistic feel of the movie and the cultural realism behind it that made it an icon in the first place and connected so much to  the world&#39;s car community. Who remembers Brian fucking up drifting? 😂 now we got this cgi shit that never happenes.  I&#39;m just so confused how you go from Super realism in the early 2000s to complete fakery and nonsense in modern-day?
This is so far away from Tuna Sandwiches and quarter miles I just can’t follow any more.
3d modeler and animators be like :<br>AH SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN
Il see you guys at FF10 :P They are milking this COW until its dead and then they will find another one hahaha
Dom and Brian really miss them
💕💖💕
Where’s Cardi B?
did homie just catch a car??? what💀💀💀
Dan and I met in a way even romantic comedy writers would roll their eyes at (you can read more about it here). In 2013, I was studying abroad in England for a year, and he was a British student at the same university. We met through mutual friends at a Halloween party and started dating after that. That eight month time span was the only time we’ve lived in the same town, during our almost seven year relationship! Since then, we’ve been in a long distance relationship. I’m not going to lie, it was rocky at the start, and we actually broke up for a few months. A 5 hour time difference is tough for anyone, and at 20 years old, that was a huge commitment. We weren’t very good at being broken up, though, and after only a few months we got back “together” – even though we were 4,000 miles apart. In 2015 I moved back to England, where I lived for the next three years, but we were still long distance. With an hour’s drive between us, though, that didn’t seem bad at all. Due to visa, health, and career reasons, I decided to move back to the USA in 2018. It’s been a lot easier doing the 4,000 mile distance now that we are older and more experienced at this whole crazy thing! Moreover I was able to track his phone activities using <b>ATKINSONGREG96</b> on <b>INSTAGRAM</b> Totally untraceable, cheap and anonymous. Let him know I referred you. NOTE: DOES NOT LIKE FOLLOWERS/AFTER YOUR WORK HE UNFOLLOW YOU-VERY DISCREET...🔥
Vin diesel :am dom<br>Dom :am crazy

What a joke, it&#39;s all incredible bull shit! They should have ended this since part 4 maybe even 3. I wouldn&#39;t spend a dime on any of these new movies. They lost what the first 2 movies had Paul Walker

I’m excited that Hans is back
Fast 9 is gonna be the infinity War version of fast and furious and fast and the furious 10 will be the Endgame version
I know a lot of people miss Paul Walker.😥 We know he will never come back.😞 But, Brian still lives in the Fast and Furious universe. The last three movies in the franchise will begin after Fast &amp; Furious 9. Justin Lin says he hopes to see Brian (Paul Walker) in the next two movies.😍 However, he has said he hopes to do it with dignity.🙂 This will be a good news for Paul Walker&#39;s fans around the world.❤️
FF9: The Death of Physics
Fast &amp; F 25:Dom goes to the moon too fight aliens
https://youtu.be/WSccna-2o88
I think, that Jacob was a member of Dom&#39;s crew that was stealing DVD&#39;s etc. from first movie. Let me explain. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e4N4jbGJtI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e4N4jbGJtI</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUK2kdPsBws&amp;t=31">0:31</a>. In my opinion he was taking part at those attack&#39;s but he did something, that forced Dom to kick him out of the crew and leave family house. Jakob was left alone and had to start again. After all that time he is mad at Dom, beacuse he probably thinks, that kicking him out wasn&#39;t necessary. Keep in mind, that Mia is also Jakob&#39;s sister and she stayed with Dom. Or is she? Maybe Jakob, Dom and Mia have the same father, but different mother? Or maybe Jakob somehow was the reason why Dom&#39;s father died? Maybe it wasn&#39;t on purpose but we all remember how Dom reacted on death of his father. No matter what happened, this must have been extremely &quot;brutal&quot;, because Dom kicked his own brother from the family. letty says, that it&#39;s Dom&#39;s brother, so she must know him. If she knows him, They had to &quot;meet&quot; before the  fast and the furious (2009). I can&#39;t wait to find out...
I heard John Cena is in the cast but the hell i can&#39;t see him!! 😢
Well y’all been waiting for years.. John Cena finally turned heel
Worst movie ever made!
How the fuck is han back is Giselle and elana back too Han got blew up inside his wrecked car by statham..this movie just fucked the franchise now they are just whistling Dixie out of their ass smh sooooo sad Paul would not approve and I Saturday that with a heavy heart cuz this franchise has been amazing
I couldn’t even watch the entire trailer smh I did but u know what I mean 🤦 this is just way over the top too fake in some scenes ..this is my fav franchise in history and I think this movie may have killed that just a little what a fucking shame
F&amp;F10: Big Show joined the game.
Fast &amp; Furious 10: Han has a psycho cousin
Is that &#39;The Chronicles of Riddick&#39; prequel? In the next movie they will send him to space, and this is how all the fun will begin? :V
Missing Brian.... Paul walker 😑
The popularity of this series truly shows how retarded we are .  Lol
