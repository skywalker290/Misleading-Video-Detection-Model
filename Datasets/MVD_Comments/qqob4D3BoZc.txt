não ligamos para ela?<br>Então você quer sair com alguém<br>Para fazer todas as coisas que você fazia comigo<br>Eu juro, eu sei que você quer<br><br>Você me levava pra sair no seu carrão<br>E me beijava na chuva<br>E quando eu ligo pra você<br>Não sei onde você está<br>Até que eu ouço ela dizer seu nome<br>Eu cantava junto com você, quando você tocava violão<br>Apenas uma lembrança distante<br>Espero que ela te trate melhor do que você me tratava, ha<br><br>Eu estou na sua cola, sim, você<br>Eu não sou sua número um<br>Eu vi você com ela<br>Se beijando e se divertindo<br>Se você está dando todo o seu dinheiro e tempo<br>Eu não vou sentar aqui desperdiçando o meu com você, sim, você<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei<br><br>Depois de três, depois de quatro vezes<br>Por que eu me dou ao trabalho?<br>Me diz quantas vezes mais vou passar por isso<br>Até ficar mais esperta?<br>Não preciso negar a dor e as mentiras<br>E todas as coisas que você fez comigo<br>Eu juro, eu sei que você fez<br><br>E agora você leva ela pra sair no seu carrão<br>E você beija ela na chuva<br>E quando ela te liga<br>Ela sabe onde você está<br>Mas eu sei de forma diferente<br>Agora ela canta contigo, quando você toca violão<br>Criando memórias novas em folha<br>Espero que você trate ela melhor do que você me tratou<br><br>Eu estou na sua cola, sim, você<br>Eu não sou sua número um<br>Eu vi você com ela<br>Se beijando e se divertindo<br>Se você está dando todo o seu dinheiro e tempo<br>Eu não vou sentar aqui desperdiçando o meu com você, sim você<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei (cansei)<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei (não, não, não, não)<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei<br>Se você está dando todo o seu dinheiro e tempo<br>Eu não vou sentar aqui desperdiçando o meu com você, sim, você<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei<br><br>E agora você leva ela pra sair, no seu carrão<br>E você beija ela na chuva<br>E quando ela te liga<br>Ela sabe onde você está<br>Mas eu sei de

dinheiro e tempo<br>Eu não vou sentar aqui desperdiçando o meu com você, sim, você<br>Tchau, adeus, cansei<br><br><br>Ciao Adios<br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>Uh<br><br>Ask you once, ask you twice now<br>There&#39;s lipstick on your collar<br>You say she&#39;s just a friend now<br>Then why don&#39;t we call her?<br>So you want to go on with someone<br>To do all the things you used to do to me<br>I swear, I know you do<br><br>Used to take me out in your fancy car<br>And make out in the rain<br>And when I ring you up<br>Don&#39;t know where you are<br>Till I hear her say your name<br>Used to sing along, when you played guitar<br>Just a distant memory<br>Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha<br><br>I&#39;m onto you, yeah, you<br>I&#39;m not your number one<br>I

I&#39;m done<br>Ciao, adiós, I&#39;m done<br><br>After three, after four times<br>Why did I bother?<br>Tell me how many more times<br>Does it take to get smarter?<br>Don&#39;t need to deny the hurt and the lies<br>And all of the things that you did to me<br>I swear, I know you did<br><br>And now you take her out in your fancy car<br>And make out in the rain<br>And when she rings you up<br>She know where you are<br>But I know differently<br>Now she sings along, when you play guitar<br>Making brand-new memories<br>Hope you treat her better than you treated me<br><br>I&#39;m onto you, yeah, you<br>I&#39;m not your number one<br>I saw you with her<br>Kissing and having fun<br>If you&#39;re giving all of your money and time<br>I&#39;m not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah,

Such an amazing song, but I don&#39;t get why is she showcasing mostly black people in a Moroccan themed video, if you gonna showcase a country&#39;s culture and architecture...why get out of the context when it comes to the people/performers?
Calling u m ph
I love it❤❤❤
Since 2021 I have never healed 😢
The vibe of this song never dies
