the &quot;skskskskks&quot; made it for me
pewdiepie the truth is that there is another rew on youtube that is more loved by the people of Latin America and you also did not include a Spanish speaking channel
I’m so happy pewds did a juice wrld cameo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=260">4:20</a> he will always stay alive in our heart! 999 4L

Cant wait to see what YouTube will do next year huh? Well since i have the infinite knowledge of the future i can tell you they fixed it by removing the dislike button.
This seems TOO RECENT
What a terrible time to be alive
This video sucks in my opinion its just a bunch of stupid music over stupid clips
in my opion i dont think this is good its kinda bad
We need the 2023 rewind
awesome! seeing the DK Rap frkm DK64 . DK himself, Diddy Kong and K.Rool! but my favourite Banjo&amp;Kazooie in this awesome video!
Раньше было лучше 😢 ( ушел тот ютуб) и контент после 2020 все изменилось.
Whos watching this in 2023
Still waiting for someone to help me find the instrumental for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=240">4:00</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=300">5:00</a>
When YouTube was actually fun  , i remember waiting every day for pewds video .
The transition from marques to that is still so good.
POV: this is in your recommended too

It&#39;s been three years and I am just now noticicing the ikea tower in the backround when he gets hit by the truck
this is still obviously really bad but its better than what youtube made
I absolutely despise PewDiePie, but this is actually good stuff.<br>Also, answering the last question on the vid.<br>They did jack and shit.
What’s the instrumental @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=240">4:00</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=300">5:00</a>

What’s the instrumental @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=240">4:00</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=240">4:00</a> bro this right here is something that i love seeing.<br>not even youtube could ever do the same.<br>they&#39;re too chicken to even talk a little bit about the sad stuff for their dumbass, party-going rewinds.
Good times 😢

How Dillon The Hecker Died?
Rudy Ploiesteanul &amp; Bogdan Artistul &amp; Kristiyana

So wild to go back to this, how different life was back then...
It&#39;s very brave they murdered pewdiepie with a truck for this video
We’re still paying for the “can’t wait to see what you do next year”
Good times 😢🥺
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=41">0:41</a> “Creep bruh aw man” is a stupid but still popular meme
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=179">2:59</a> gem
I missed this, just wished it was done for every year
Please let&#39;s make this a tradition
It&#39;s already been 3 years wtf
Why it feels like it was just a year 😩
I wish we would know when we lived in the good times
No rewind for 2020,2021,2022
TO this day hearing that clip of ETIKA still brings tears to my eyes. RIP Etika. Joyconboyz 4ever
Everything changed when the CoViD NaTiOn AtTaCkEd...
RIP Juice 😢😔
Is that wildcat as the baby
“Cant wait to see what you do next year youtube good luck” that aged well…
I wish he would do these again
It has been years guys (January 2 2013)
Who thinks this is the best rewind ever?
I’m here on New Year’s Eve. I can’t believe it was 3 years ago
Youtube dropped the ball on rewind, someone has to pick it up
God this was right before covid spread around and I rewatch this video every year to remember the good old times. Happy new year everyone
my mind is blown how all this was 3 years ago
Official, 3 year&#39;s now according to my timezone
Happy 3 years anniversary happy new year
It&#39;s been 3 years already, how time flies!
This video is where humanity peaked. Everything went downhill after this video.
Please make rewind 2022
its a tradition to come back to this video every once in a while
Rewind 2020: &quot;Let&#39;s take a moment for those we lost this year&quot;<br>2020: 😐
I agree to top10 👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=122">2:02</a>
what&#39;s the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=240">4:00</a> aka the tribute song
nah, this rewind is also bad, I came back to this and I wasn&#39;t hit with nostalgia, I felt cringe...
We need you for this year pewdiepie
God... I miss etika. <br>These are memories of a generation. <br>Legends will live on.
Thurston 🥺💕
And then MrBeast took over rewind and ruined everything

Another GOOD REAL REWIND
RIP Etika we will never forget you ❤️
IKEA!

wow this is actually worse
I love pewdiepies rewind

Charlies song fits in so well
Good old days
WHY IS THE MUSIC SO GOOD 😩
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=321">5:21</a> I wish there was a full version of this song
Seeing Etika hit hard...
When times were great
Bro they share the same likes
ahhhh time went by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=122">2:02</a>
Wow
Honestly just get Pewds to do the rewinds.
Classic pewdiepie stealing pyros content AND for the second year in a row in rewind smh my head
Dillon the Hacker died?
What is the song during Ricardo Milos part?
Boring
Last year of good memes
Etika would love to see Sora in smash today.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=326">5:26</a> what is that song where the beat changes a bit?
Это мемный rewind
Flyingkitty part is better
I miss Dillon man.
acctualy 2018 was better
Better than ever ❤️
&quot;we made something you didnt like&quot;<br>NOW WERE MAKING A TOP 10 WATCH MOJO UNDERRATED CHANNEL VIDEO
Rewind started going downhill starting with 2017, but even that video had highlights. 2018 was just crap that wasn’t about YouTubers.
King of random
Dillon the hacker
Anyone know who that is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=123">2:03</a> I can&#39;t remember
youtube&#39;s been awfully silent after this released
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=274">4:34</a>
Just a year
That moment when YouTube rewind hasn&#39;t happened since this.
Ricardo &lt;3
<b>THEY ACTUALLY DISABLED DISLIKES BECAUSE YOU</b>
The original one got more views than this, but the like are the same , which proved PewDiePie has scuces to make it actually better.
🎷🗿
🎷🎷🎷🎸🎺🎻🥁
Heh rewind
yes i do
Aw, man I missed this already. I love listening to it when it first came out. Idk but it gives me a little of nostalgia.
Nostalgic
The first person in the rewind is my best friends brother.
No dislikes I like it nothing to see pewds would be happy
This is so nostalgic coming back in 2022 to hear this
I actually really feel bad for Dylan. he was a great troll who fooled basically everyone, and maybe a little too well since I&#39;ve seen comments on some of his vids saying he&#39;s burning in hell :(
does anybody know the first song ?
I like how this video got the same amount of likes as the real yt rewind with having less than 25% of the views
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=212">3:32</a>😂😂😂
Watching in 2022 and feeling the Nostalgia 😔
whats the first song
good old days
nice
&quot;Can&#39;t wait to see what you do next year youtube!&quot;<br>he jinxed us
NDL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=110">1:50</a>
Baid
Any legends still watching in 2022?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=262">4:22</a> wow! Respect.
wath&#39;s the song of the tribute part ?
The nostalgia hits hard
It’s 2022.
How tf is this already 2 years ago, feels like yesterday
we are in 2022 and this is still funny
This is a whole different generation
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=180">3:00</a> song?
This year I lost my hero juice WRLD 999
Rest In Peace Etika my god seeing his little memorial again brought a tear. I terribly miss him.🙏🏽😢
In a parallel universe where rewind is good
jeff
This video has 20 million dislikes I can see it
if someone else made this, it would&#39;ve been cringe af
One of my favourite videos on youtube!
Idc what you say this is the best rewind ever
Looking at the history<br>And nothing can be funnier than hearing San Andrea&#39;s theme over cyber punk scam😂
this is perfect boiss
masterpiece, I&#39;m watching this cause we didn&#39;t get no 2021 rewind
This made me cry
&quot;Doin&#39; a fine job. Make stuff your proud of. Love you.&quot; Get&#39;s me every time. Thank you pewds.
no thing we have war no more for you
This is how it&#39;s done youtube
We need this 2022
Bruh I remember sksksksks that shit was annoying af
Damn. What a great year that was
Juice got an &quot;in memory&quot; feature and not X?<br>Wooow.<br>I&#39;m opposed to liking this now. 😭
I wish he made more of these for the 2020s
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 years
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=109">1:49</a>
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87
why was juice featured in this rewind but not X in 2018 version?
Came Back after the miserable start of 2022
And due to covid YouTube never made a rewind again and whole world jinxed
The gods have spoken
still the best rewind ive ever seen
this feels like yesterday why did i have to grow up so fast
if watching this back fave me goosebumps, imagine what YouTube could&#39;ve made and how much they threw away
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=201">3:21</a> awwe &lt;3
whats the first song?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=250">4:10</a> whats the music
good old times when covid didnt exist
Flyingkitty is funniest part for me
Dillon hit… juice got me and Etika fcked me up. 3 years after, wtf.
They Better Keep Me!
Missing these ngl
No
I’ll always love this
2 years but still feels like yesterday
YouTube didn&#39;t do anything
The fact that YouTube’s not doing rewind anymore makes me think that the youtubers should do rewind now ahem Felix
RIP GRANT ETIKA AND JUICE WRLD. 999
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=108">1:48</a> - Ray William Johnson
I can&#39;t explain to you why, but whenever I&#39;m feeling down and needing a complete pick me up, this video somehow brings me joy from a place I can&#39;t begin to explain.<br><br>It&#39;s helped me soo much, that it has been my ring tone for over a year, and every time I hear it I get such unexplainable happiness.<br><br>Thank you PewDiePie
man, re-watching this from 2022 almost hit close to home, I wish I didn&#39;t treat it that harshly
It would&#39;ve been nice if he continued these
Yoink. My content now.
This better than avengers endgame
Man
2020?
Rest In peace Etika.
Here in 2022 just wish he made these regardless of no more rewinds being made
no 2021 rewind?
Wait the minute? What happened to rewind 2020-2021?😢
Wake up guys it&#39;s 2022
Ya know what that pyrocinical guy is really funny I hope he doesn’t get controversial on Twitter
When our humor was actually good
Damn you telling me this was 2 years ago 😔
Where is Rewind 2021?
Hopefully 2022 will be better XD screw covid man I’m sick of it why can’t we go back to this time
YouTube really gave up 😂
Now 2021
Ah yes before it happened
How is this better than YouTube’s rewind if they both have 3.4M likes
TH0CC
2022 be like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=377">6:17</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=387">6:27</a> what is that? i recognize it. it sounds high-pitched. anybody know?
where is 2021?
The fact we will probably never see a meme rewind or a collab with these guys again :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=115">1:55</a> best part
Now it&#39;s time for YouTube rewind 2021!! 🤠🤠

Fuck, when I saw Etika again after 2 years I actually teared up. I wasn&#39;t ready for this shit.
I man i was alright with 2018( your version)
I guess deleting the dislike button was a preparation for this years rewind

Please can we have one this year!!!!!!!!!
Truck kun always struck... <br><br>I wish you a Nice Harem Pewds .

Loves, no slaughterhouse on earth is worse than hell. Any human who does not accept JESUS as their LORD will not be saved from hell. It is your choice to go to hell because your sin landed you there or be saved by GOD through JESUS. HE is waiting for you. HE loves you and is willing to heal you if you were to ask HIM to save you. I bless you all with humility to accept this in the name of JESUS..
hi
pewdiepie&#39;s joke in the end aged really poorly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=262">4:22</a> 💔💔
Best rewind I&#39;ve ever seen!
XYZ
Pewdiepie
It was very they died
etika &lt;3
some memes felt like yesterday and some felt like a eternity
There are 3 types of responses in this civilized world when YouTube announced that they were removing the dislike button,<br>Those who said [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=58">0:58</a>] <br>and Those who said [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=214">3:34</a>]<br>And those who said both
Just rewatching this n damn that hurt when juice came up
Just for those who didn&#39;t know teh dislikes: this video had -12 dislikes
What the hell was 🙄🙄🙄

I shall dislike the video simply because you can&#39;t see dislikes.
&quot;Sir... I&#39;m afraid Mr.Beast has beaten you in the likes.&quot;

Let us thank pewds for giving us the rewind we deserve.
This shit is epic
I love when they put Sasuke in the vid
&quot;Can&#39;t wait to see what you do next year, YouTube.&quot;<br><br>Well, they are now removing the dislike button.
looking at this about 2 years later. God this was a good year
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=414">6:54</a><br>YouTube: forget it. I&#39;m done. He&#39;s right.

Hey pewds are you planning to make 2021 rewind?
Welcome covid 19
Pewdiepie has done it again with the absolute masterpiece
V, V
I liked how the gta sa theme stepped in in the end
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=69">1:09</a> Sasuke in YouTube Rewind fr

At least MrBeast made a 2020 Rewind better than ever.
It&#39;s so funny to see the &#39;lil brat Greta talking and then it shows MrBeast initiative of planting 20 million trees.
I was turning up my brightness and I tired up my volume all of my family could hear it for like 5 seconds 🙈🤦‍♀️🙈
Pewds: &quot;Can&#39;t wait to see what you do next year youtube&quot;<br><br>Youtube: No more rewind

Flying kitty&#39;s part was the best

Its just a meme compilation lol
That&#39;s actually bullshit pewdiepie worked hard for his subs
The fact they included naruto is SUPERB!!!

Indisputable proof that Felix is above YouTube.
The good times, before covid.

Imagine randomly hearing out of nowhere the word JEFF

As much as I loved Beast’s rewind, it just wasn’t the same. I hope poods does one for 2021. Better yet, Felix and Jimmy could collaborate and do one together

“Cant wait to see what u do next year youtube” YouTube just like “if we dont post shit he cant critique it”
What about xxxtenacion death or he doesn&#39;t matter

2018 rewind was epic
I&#39;d never think a video full of memes could be both wholesome and funny at the same time
This hits different in 2021
Man when juice was on the screen my heart broke😢😖
Nostalgia
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=87">1:27</a> Man created a earthquake

YouTube has been very quiet after this
Dis actually went hard
Pewds: Can&#39;t wait to see what you do next year.<br><br>Next year: gives up
Etika was my favorite streamer he was just a really good influencer and person I cried when he died.
So no ones gonna talk about how funny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=225">3:45</a> is?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diT6jc9flkc&amp;t=140">2:20</a> that didn&#39;t age well
Flying kitty
I&#39;d trust this guy to make YouTube a platform that&#39;s actually creator friendly
The amount of Shane Dawson really hasn’t aged well
watching in 2021 and still vibing to it
LMAO
They should have hired him to make youtube rewind 2020
it s good to feel part of the history
Really delian the hacker?
Mr.beast rewind is superb than yours
Its pretty sad. Pewds couldn&#39;t make rewind 2020 because he was so focused on the coco diss track. Then that got deleted. Feels like we never see any of the real pewdiepie anymore.
A real legend of this platform the real face of YouTube
still mis etika
I miss you everyday Juice. I hope you rest in peace up there.
This video is a sack of shit... I LOVED IT!!!
“In 2018 we made something you didn’t like.” Lol he actually that XD
