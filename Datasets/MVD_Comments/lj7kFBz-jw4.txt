Lets see Paul Allen&#39;s card
WHOS HERE 2024<br>👇
So like i acidentally deleted my apple card then got it back. But the one i got back was a different one and sent me this card. What am i supposed to do with it?
Apple already has me &quot;trapped&quot; in their ecosystem and honestly, I love it. Sure the hardware is more expensive but I think it&#39;s worth the cost.
It&#39;s not titanium fully
10,000 available jeeeze
he hates the color brown?  😒
How do you make online purchases without a card # and a pin #?
I can’t believe I just watched a credit card unboxing after 4 years of not knowing that it exists.........
Wait until you have to dispute one of your charges. Worst manipulative service ever, they will never side with you and you’ll also pay twice as much as the original dispute in the end.
Great info: on my ipadpro - the apple wallet app does not show up in the app library or my home screen. what can I do to get this app on to my ipadpro. thanks
Could you show us your real credit card for comparison?
The interest rate on the savings was a bigger draw for me than the credit card itself.
Let me tell you who maybe spend that much in an Apple Store. <br>Companys. This card is Apple trying to ger in to the &quot;Company Card&quot; market.
Happy To See You !!! ❤🙏🏻
A card for that 15 million credit line for marques
India is the second country to have it .. Thanks to US INDIA friendship.
We not gonna talk about how he dropped over 1k for the color orange on his card in the app?
As of June 2023 the Apple Card does not work in Japan
How bo BGVRP for my ipad 8 bro good bye bro have. Aogod day
I left Apple for A Galaxy once. Never again!!! I’m Apple forever now!! I’m deep in the ecosystem!!
I have the Apple Card and he’s absolutely right. It’s not that impressive as a credit card but damn do I love pulling it out and using it
Crazy technology now a days
tbh im happy with the debit card bendigo bank gives you for free
How used is it today? I feel like the article died so fast.
I love how it doesn’t have the numbers on the card itself especially the 3 digits. I’ve had my card numbers copied so every time handing over my card is a reminder of that…
I think this is a representation of what the Apple Car will be. Apple will partner with other brand/s to manufacture their car, while Apple will control the design, interface, ect.
Can you start with this card if you got no history? or is there some credit requirement to have it 🤔
So it’s basically useless because everywhere you could just use Apple Pay with your phone or watch. The card app is also pretty much exactly the same as any banking app, at least in The Netherlands. Don’t know about USA but I do know they are behind on a lot of stuff.
Watching this on my Apple Card
Last 🎉
You don’t carry your Apple Card in your wallet, you leave it at home and take a picture of it to show people.
the back kinda ruined it for me cause the front of the card is so nice
If someone has my IPhone and a card I&#39;m sure they pretty much killed me and they could easily use my face. It&#39;s stupid I can get a $14,000 car loan but I can&#39;t get a Apple Card.
Only u can make me watch a 7 min video on a credit card unboxing 😂
Probably 800$
The best Apple Card unboxing ever <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=68">1:08</a>  now I just need an update Vidie about Apple Pay
The intros are fantastic every time
“…they don&#39;t have your face”
I basically use this like a American Express card it’s dope NGL
The apple “ecosystem” is kinda a lame term, i have used apple phones and iPods my whole life, and I’m never gonna switch, but at the same time, I’m never going to buy a Mac as my main computer, windows 10 can just do more with gaming, apple makes good products, but I’m not gonna buy every apple thing.
Awesome Review!!! Very well explained!!!!
How course he’d have the maximum $10k limit<br>And it’s 3% at Apple but several other participating companies
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=388">6:28</a> marques warning is that there may be a time we all try to switch back toc android😊
I need the intro song!
Nice. Let’s see Paul Allen’s card
what if it bends after staying in the trouser pocket, as it is not flexible like plastic.
I had to have one just to say I’ve got a credit card made out of metal. LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=272">4:32</a> jokes on you, I have a scalpel
We need a 3 year review! Curious to know your experience.
Sends nothing vibes
The biggest apple sucker in the world.
Where is this now,  Any of these actually out in the wild?
Does it charge an annual Apple Tax?
But does it play fortnite?
Boredom forced me to watch MKBHD unbox a credit card😂😂😂
You can&#39;t even withdraw &quot;cash&quot; at all like when going for the farmers market you sometimes need to pay by cash, and at least he talked about switching to android.
dude is a savage, having his first purchase on an APPLE card to buy a SAMSUNG phone.... lol
this might be the highest level of apple simping possible
It is the Applecalypse!
Did they really not include the number on the card? I feel like that would be a big handicap for online payments.
as a server, I get to see these every so often, they are the nicest feeling cars I have ever felt but they don&#39;t have numbers on them so if the card doesn&#39;t swipe, I can&#39;t run the card.
I&#39;m gonna be honest, I&#39;m so far in the ecosystem that I have no intentions of leaving. I&#39;ve had my experiences with plenty of Androids and I am not impressed. I&#39;ll stay in the garden.
I am a victim of the system. Send help pls
The first
Only available in the USA
I think you can use Android for apply wallet even if you moved to Android
There was a guy in my high school that got one of these some how but didn’t really understand the concept of a credit card. He ended up maxing it out, so his dad sold his car to pay for the bill. Man was coming to school with 1k outfits and buying people lunches at school like a mobster 😂😂😂

I finally found this video. I didn’t know to use the card
Now do a real credit card unboxing without censoring anything!
💙
Hello Marques. I&#39;m curious to know if it a problem to be hooked into the ecosystem? If Apple products help you fulfil your life purpose and add genuine value to you, is it really a problem to use them all smoothly?🤔
My Amex black card is also titanium
I’m willing to be trapped inside Apple’s walled-garden. I don’t fucking care anymore. 💀💀💀
First time I’ve actually watched a Marques Brownlee video after Twomad meme’d on him so much.
Why does it have a magnetic bar?<br>We don&#39;t use those since the 90s
I was just approved for this card. Should receive the card in 3-5 days. Looking forward to the benefits.
So many people mad at the company they support —- weird because its easy to be discipline when it comes to credit cards — dont spend money on things you cannot afford smh — Apple Card has pros and cons just like any other financial banking product
They denied me twice. Goldman Sachs thinks you need to walk to speculate currency. &quot;I said you don&#39;t need to walk to speculate currency..!&quot;
2 yer later in India.<br>What is Apple card?
I don’t think this deserved a review…
I’m all Apple so I don’t mind being trapped
⬆️⬆️Ever since he was ⬆️⬆️recommended to me he was a sourc of joy to me he save me from getting scammed he help me with credit card and walk me through all steps I got my funds for real

Was pre-approved and have this card on the way, I don&#39;t have an iPhone though, bought my son an iPhone 6s years ago that he lost. Lol
&quot;I&#39;m not going to try to actually break this thing&quot;, God where is jerryrigeverything when we need him.
An apple mask and now credit cards... unboxing community reached a new lvl guys
This guy thinks this is the best card in the entire world. It even runs on Apple M1 chip.
Brownlee has turned unboxing into an art. He could unbox Kraft mac-n-cheese and I&#39;d happily watch the video.
Soon apple card ultra pro max 5G with face id
What happens if another person rips your face off? Will they then be able to use your card? That is if they use your face. I’m asking for a friend.
Well it needs have PayPass.
Many things that Nubank already does.
You can also change your card number which pretty cool.
Only other metal card I know of is the Visa Black, and that&#39;s like crazy money, like you can buy a private jet and then some crazy with it, and surprise surprise it belonged to a banker friend (generic term for any douchebag, yes my friend is also a douchebag, who&#39;s business is making money from money). I also know metal cards are excellent for carving cocaine lines so Apple Card certainly has an edge over the Visa Black.
Finally a good card to cut some lines with
Imagine Me Stealing Marques Card Package And Activating It With My iPhone xD
Is someone actually using this card even after 2 years ? For me it’s useless
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/CIW60IPp_dYCFcuqTgodEu4IlQ"></a>

In order to buy it you need.....a creditcard
I&#39;m from 2022. YouTube just recommended me this. Idk why
No apple stickers.......!!!??
Why would you wanna take steps back and go Android.
Apple: the most innovative credit card yet
If it&#39;s apple, get ready for an unboxing
Just use the card for food and or gas and then pay it off as soon as possible before the due date and keep your statements at zero and it’ll raise your credit score. That’s really the only reason to use this card.
White is fine as there is absolutely zero reason to put this in your wallet.
I just got mine, and I unboxed it and was thoroughly impressed as I am with every Apple product! I activated it, but I don’t want to use it, because it is such a nice card! I don’t want to damage its beauty! But I don’t know why I’m surprised! That’s apple 100% Every apple product I’ve ever unboxed has been very premium, and you have to wrap it in a case to preserve its beauty!
Flex of the decade 👌
I just knew man this is super Cool
i wonder why no contactless
GL
Only a $10k limit?
So amazing 😉
How tf the corner store got Apple Pay but Walmart doesn’t
When they drop the limited edition black Apple Card I’ll get it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=390">6:30</a> this THANK YOU, I like switching from apple to Samsung back and forth so this is a no go then
no contactless?
I normally really like your reviews, and I get that this is from Apple, but I can’t help but feel like this whole video is a joke. Come on man, this is not “tech,” this is just a credit card, and a not very good one at that…
Cmon MKBHD we know you got a AMEX black card lmao
damn that 10k credit limit. must be nice being a millionaire XD
Just saw this video after getting approved for it, I got it because I heard it is an ok credit card to start with as a first card
But can that card still Jimmy open a locked door? I don&#39;t think so!
Whats his credit limit to buy an 1,000 computer??
No you don’t HAVE  to leave your credit card
he actually just bought a Samsung with and apple credit card
now you need an apple card?
Dudes got more that 10,000.00 available
Is this still a thing?
I don&#39;t quite think this deserves a video lol
7 mins of talking about a credit card😂
wrg, and doesn tmatterx
I’m over here with a 2,000$ limit with apple while you have a 10,000$ limit and buying a note 10
Two years later, the rewards still suck.
7.7 million people watched a credit card being unboxed 😂
I just got mine. I was laughing when I opened it. We use a one card system and I’m a voluntary apple prisoner going on 18 years now, so I figured, why not. 🙃
Is the card in the UK
i just opened mine and i had to search a review. i’m so amazed by it, honestly turning me into an apple fanboy
“And even if they do have your iPhone.. they don’t have your face” LOL
anyone else waiting for the Apple Card max???
Ordered one last night, can’t wait for it to arrive 🤟🏾
I am surprised they didn&#39;t make the chip and credit limit an extra.
10k limit
Do you know JESUS as your savior??????
God is love 🙏❤️❤️😍😍🙏 God.
CHRIST is the only way to heaven 💔❤️🙏.
I love the apple it’s so cool!!!
I got denied 2x so🤷🏽‍♀️😑
Apple to soon make iDo for couples
Just saying even if you buy a new iPhone once every three years that&#39;s approximately $300 every 3 years considering most iPhones that are actually worth buying or over $1,000 in fact most products from Amazon are over $1,000 so even if you buy one major item from them per year that&#39;s hundreds of dollars every year
If you were already worried about getting a credit card from Apple then no need to worry any further there&#39;s also Goldman Sachs on there so you know you&#39;re going to get screwed financially one way or another with this card
You know it&#39;s Apple because they put ten times as much packaging is it actually needed to ship it
I got this card to buy a MacBook but I returned the MacBook haha
Give this card my dear sweetheart Omar Borkan forever hurry up
Ok but what about debit?

Can you update this video with a 2 year review
This is the most pathetic card ever, 12-24% interest lol, might get one just to sell the titanium tho
Credit or debit ?
Introducing real life features that will ruin your credit in 10 seconds
I know this video is very dated, but that 3% I’m sure came in handy went bye the Apple products you use, LOL.
So this is when Waveform aired it&#39;s first episode
i can&#39;t believe MB doesn&#39;t have a Amex Black card.
Very good , that hint. By now i am an android User. But next time i buy a phone ,it could be an Iphone. That doesnt mean i totally switch to apple . But like you say , be aware.<br>So if i had all that stuff , the phone , the ITunes collection, the card , the photos in da storage i would almost be forced to stay in this ecosystem
<b>There a lot of scammer on YouTube and !!G.... am so glad to come across trustworthy vendor @plugdumps on telegram you’re man of your word!! My credit card 💳 have been delivered to me this morning and it’s work perfectly kudos to you aye 🙌.</b>
Apple Card normally: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=211">3:31</a><br>Apple Card after buying Samsung phone with it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=232">3:52</a>
I got an ad of Apple Pay
Honestly, half the banking apps suck so much. It would be so nice to just control everything from your phone like that.
Hey, bro. Awaiting, apple i am sure they might include the card, about drill challenge and reward, are you aware of that?
The only flaw about this card is when they use it in person by using to chip or swiping the card. But over all it’s a great card and the features are amazing.<br>I have about 7 different credit card and use each one for different things for example one for gas, groceries traveling, family, one to treat myself and one for emergencies. The key is to pay them all off at the same time or even better make two payments a month. For example pay half of the payments and pay the rest a week before the due day. That way your interest rates go down and your credit goes up.<br>True story I did this for about a year and my credit score went from a 630 to a 750 now.<br>Best wishes to you all and like my grandpa alway said never buy anything with cash save it and invest it and only buy with credit… that’s why I love this country so much god bless🙏🏼 <br><br>Also most cards I would apply for I would get denied or would give me the lowest credit limit of $500 and when I applied for the Apple Card it literally took less than 30 minutes and got approved on the spot for 7k without waiting for a letter from them just had to wait less than a week I honestly use the Apple Card more now just for the reason that I feel more secured with it
i’m gonna go to a samsung store and buy something with this card
So we are doing credit card reviews now…and I thought that food review was going to far
Apple could’ve done better with their packaging!
The most worthless credit card…

How does the card hold up with wear etc?
Get an apple credit card and buy other products not related to apple... That would be fun.

I am used to apple don&#39;t know how to use android phone
If I decided I wanted to go over to Android I would just cancel my Apple Card. Easy
I was really hoping the Apple Card would do what the curve card does.

I have one. Don&#39;t even keep it in my wallet though. I haven&#39;t used it in a while because masking makes using apple wallet a pain in stores.
I wish people would use this more so banks would step up their game when it comes to UX. But uh yeah apple card doesn&#39;t even exist here in Germany

You can definitely switch your phone to anything you want, just don’t trade in your iPhone. That’s honestly simple 😂 it’s gunna be like having an iPod lol and you’ll now have two phones. Unless I’m missing something here. And being that this was a year ago, the new updates give it a green light.
$10,000.00 limit... sheesh.

Great channel
Unfortunately, still useless for those of us who rely on personal finance apps to aggregate all of our spending/investing/saving, as Apple Card is not fully compatible with any of them.

How do you mean it flexes way less you literally can flex on the world that you have a apple card
Love the j Cole instrumental in the beginning
I need this card 😁
Same
So If I needed money, and I got the Apple card, and it&#39;s connected to Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, could my parents transfer money directly into my account and use it through the card?
you must be glad they didnt ask another 500$ for printing the name
basically a credit card with 2FA

I actually like this card... I use it for FOOD ONLY.  I have a few cards that I use for miscellaneous things but having this one for food is pretty nice since I DoorDash and Uber Eats my life away. I also know I won’t get anywhere close to maxing it out so the interest doesn’t bother me that much. Ultimately, it is easier to track my fat-ass eating habits/how much I use for food ONLY (Because goodness knows I’m a foodie). <br><br>Also, Apple is killer with the presentation; easily the nicest card I own in my collection, so like MK said it is a solid flex but anyone that’s super into finances won’t be that impressed because it’s not the best when it comes to reporting to credit bureaus/features. But, this card will be huge for Apple and as they get more people on board (And you KNOW they will) I can see them becoming similar to American Express (I love my American Express). <br><br>Apple may legit take over the world at this rate because of presentation and their ability to make technology so seamless and efficient. It’s kinda scary. It’s a nice-looking, ok-feature card.
This guy is very legit dumpsmart on telegram his dumps with pin working good and quality I just cashout 8k from his dumps

Glenn_tmt On telegram is the best and legit bought my cc from him
He is flexing his 10k limit
DON&#39;T DO IT!!! THE APPLE CARD SUCKS ALONG WITH GOLDMAN SACHS! Their attitude is terrible. Extremely difficult to make payments! You cannot send them a check. You have to give them your checking account number!! NOW!! the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!! YOU CANNOT SEND EXTRA MONEY TOWARDS YOUR BALANCE!!! You have to make the monthly payment or pay the entire Balance!! Also be very careful here. If you have your Credit Card in the Wallet App for Apple Pay the Apple Credit Card Becomes the Default Card! So now if you buy a movie in iTunes it goes on the Apple Card that  you can only pay the specified amount monthly! Really SUCKS! I can&#39;t wait to get rid of it and never use Apple again!!
Does it help with building my credit?
Might as well just get a platinum Mastercard and enjoy those benefits if you can get approved. I would but I refuse to pay $195 per year in annual fees if I don&#39;t travel that much anymore.

&quot;and if they do have your iphone, they don&#39;t have your face&quot;<br>raymond reddington wants to know your location
After the credit card they’ll be an I clothed
Honestly, it&#39;s probably best used to buy your new hardware from Apple and get that nice 3% back, otherwise a lot of other cards offer 2% back.

In case people wanted to know...The card is free but you have to ask for it they don’t automatically sent it. Interest depends on your credit. I hear you can apply if you have a score of over 600 and a low debt to income ratio. Standard is less than 30% debt.
I mean, you have iPad’s iPhone’s and AirPods. Not to mention watch . That’s the basic  ECOsystem and now the card?
Lol.....samsung pay is way more advanced
Wish it was a visa so I can use it at Costco

Dream: Apple makes an Apple Card pro in the future which not only can come in red, black, and white colors, but it would also have a small screen on the credit card itself and it would have the wallet app on it so you don’t need your iPhone to be charged. It would have the wallet app, a clock app, and the settings app. Also if it ran out of battery, you would be able to use it with your iPhone. By the way, it would also come with a fingerprint scanner to pay with.

Don’t care about the Apple ecosystem. Why would i want an Android with trash camera quality and lag.
Actually, this isnt Apples first credit card. They had several of them in the 80s.

Who thought apple would make a credit card because there so stubborn just to change something
I see some idiots on YouTube cutting the card burning it. And try to bend it to see it snap. Those people need to get a life.
Apple next year:<br>We are introducing....<br>(Hype, hype) <br><br>CardOS!!!!
Is that  colour changing thing is some  evil psychological trick to encourage debt ?
I can’t believe people fall for this credit card. It’ll put you in debt just like every other card, you’d really have to be an idiot. Sorry to be mean but🙄
here in the future people are going to be &quot;Bro, what do you mean you don&#39;t have the Apple House? Oh, you also don&#39;t have the Apple birth certificate and universal Apple ID? What a loser.&quot;
now that looks hella noice

Status symbol and flex of the decade, apple in one sentence
Didn’t get approved and I have a good credit score 🤦🏾‍♂️ keeps saying Your monthly debt obligations are too high given your income - examples may include loan or monthly housing payments
I dare you to buy Samsung with Apple Card
I wish the card was flat black
I applied for and got the card just within the past two weeks. They just added a standalone site so you can pay your Apple Card bill outside an Apple device, added more categories for 3% cash back, and more. I’d say it wasn’t worth it at launch, but way better with the new update.
Just wow 😂
This guy used an apple card to buy a samsung...
Can&#39;t wait till they add face I.D. on this thing.
Deeply happy I come across this trustworthy vendor been a second time of getting CC from him <b>Ericroboti</b><br>On telegram much love I have for you 💯✅
Apple has interest in launching everything
Yay more debt
Got my physical card from Darkorbot on telegram I can vouch for him 💯💯
As if those absolute idiots didnt call it the iCard
Hey Marques, does it work as an ID or do you have to have another one on you?
anit apple guy
Tech lead said apple card was crap or something similar to that
Apple used your name for an ad for the card I think
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=197">3:17</a> I have no words at this point
And this is why we are a debt economy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=338">5:38</a> everyone
Apple Bank ! Maybe The Only Capita Loan Institution That National Credit Card&#39;s Corporation Don&#39;t Want People To Know About ! Like Discover, Americas Express,Visa Or Masters Card !
Thank you for another great presentation!
Just me or is that a J.cole remix instrumental? @ 34 seconds?
Your only doing good on YouTube and getting Great opportunities on this platform because your a sell out it’s obvious
I would love to get one but i think its USA only :(
next thing : Apple Bank
I was expecting the apple to give this card in big suction boxes just like iPhones
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=311">5:11</a> he do be flexing those human races
When will it arrive in Italy?
Bro this is the perfect time to review this apple card after using this card for months   coz i am actually thinking to buy this card !!
APPLE WORLD BANK
ah yes<br>professional throwing cards
You had me sold until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=360">6:00</a> . Thats a really solid point and It’s literally the only reason I didn’t end up getting this card.
The most ironic thing is that he bought a SAMSUNG Galaxy Note 10 with APPLE card
Apple did launch roughly $70k Mac so three percent back would be pretty good
Markass brownie
Was anyone else expecting the physical card to change color as well?
Why d fake would you pay debrand to wrap your key card...🤨 Get a Wrap from Amazon and do it yourself..Are people there so lazy that they waste money on unnecessary/things which they can do by themselves..🤨🤨
I would never get one of them they’ll probably put you in a lot of debt

It&#39;s so interesting because the USA is the most innovative country in the world, but the banking system is not. I live in Ukraine, and if you try Monobank, you&#39;d be blown away how cool is it. There so many features in the mobile app, that this apple card seems like a weak version of the Ukrainian banking cards and mobile apps almost a decade ago)
I got my credit cards from Darkorbot on telegram someone posted him on here and I tried him,he is legit 100%
Thanks to blackieeswipe on telegram I really appreciate the clone card bro thanks for the been honest
American express buisness is the coolest card
That keeping people in the eco system thing is such a good point that I never considered when I first heard about this thing way back.
I just got an ad from Ridge wallet at the beginning of the video featuring Marques Brownlee with the first card in the wallet being the apple card as featured in the vid. Lit
We are already in August? Damn, where does the time go
It&#39;s also a Goldman Sachs credit card lol
Where is the 16-digit number?
they should&#39;ve named it Icard
Maybe now you can show us how it&#39;s wearing ....
1st : why would you buy a note 10 ? 2nd :  the integration with the &quot;wallet&quot; in the phone is pretty nice (and dangerous) but other than that .. the apple card is pretty useless isn&#39;t it ?
we are now in the era where you unbox credit cards
when you&#39;re so broke you watch a credit card unboxing
Ok legit this is cool
If I get 1, can I make it as a debit card?
&quot;I don&#39;t know who is spending that much money at apple&quot; <br>&quot;Hey everyone, today I&#39;m going to be reviewing my new $45,000 iMac pro&quot;
Marques: Apple Card biggest flex of the decade<br>Me: Hold my wheels
Clearly apple shouting out the fact that they just want your money
get a ridge wallet
And we never saw it again...
The credit card reader when you insert a titanium credit card with 57.000 dollars on it:<br>Why do I hear boss music?
Interest rate: 10,000%, users: don&#39;t care its an apple product :D
I thought they would name it iCard
Literally no one<br><br>Apple: lets make a credit card
&quot;so even if they steal your card they can&#39;t use it because they don&#39;t have your phone but even if they have your phone, they don&#39;t have your face&quot;<br>me: well, what do you do if they do have your face?
What&#39;s next? Apple wheels?
is it free to get?
Do people still use plastic cards? I&#39;m nearly 60 and have used nothing but my phone to buy stuff for the last 2 years.
credit card could look better.
I’m disappointed it’s not called the <i>iCard</i>

MKBHD: buys Samsung with Apple Card<br>Apple: so you have chosen death
Great video! I would like to see you compare the Apple Pay experience vs. Samsung Pay experience since Samsung is also deciding to dabble into the financial world by creating their own card.
Does anyone know what song is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=38">0:38</a>
Apple review video ad: Awesome screen, awesome camera, long lasting baterry life.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=272">4:32</a> but if they have your face, your kinda screwed, my guy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=385">6:25</a> I’ve never heard anybody say something negative about the Samsung ecosystem. Let’s say I’m a Samsung user and I want to switch to Apple, Samsung will release a credit card too, what then ?
yuhh he used droeloe
kinda satisfying ngl
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=265">4:25</a> what if they have your face?
My dumbass thought the changing color feature was on the card.
Take that Rebel confederate flag down in the back of the wall.
How do u put money on it?
&quot;I don&#39;t know who&#39;s spending that much at apple&quot;<br>You.  Marques, you.
I like the apple ecosystem! Happy to stay!
I’ve never even imagined seeing the orange color being worth a little more than $1k in my entire life.
&quot;I ordered my galaxy Note 10 with the Apple Card&quot;  GANG 😂
Apple Card = Trash
lol
Cant way to see a teardown on this one
You didn’t mention what are the requirements to be approved for the credit card.
I wish the physical card changed colors too, I would buy literally the entire apple store.
So you spend money to spend more money.<br>Got it.
And at which level does it start to scratch?
3% cash back is good for those subscribed to Apple Music, etc
Dam, now my friends will know I bought porn if they see that pink gradient on my credit card
But what if they do have my face???
We have to take the mask off before taking a selfie with the card🤣🤣🤣

Aw dang just one problem, in the apple wallet you didnt press show card number, i want to get this card but you dong show me that. If i know what is it ill get the apple card right away
I never understood the flex thing until I bought an iPad Pro and AirPods Pro.
They don&#39;t have ut face, but they can get a photo of you so that&#39;s easy to crack
Why when I heard about this did I think it meant anyone who had it would be able to use it to get Apple products from their stores for free like a sponsor card
Hey Siri, find my Apple card

1% cash back?!? Jesus fucking Christ, I get 5% cash back and 10% if I use my virtual card. This is just ridiculous.
He literally bought a Samsung phone with an Apple Card.
Apple: we put your card on your phone so you don’t have to bring it around with you!<br>Also Apple : Allow us to introduce- the card again.<br>iFans : <b>WOW</b> 😲

Stupid Card Nobody needs that,  2020 will be APPLE SHIT WITH ONE NEW FEATURE. Damnnn why People are still buying stupid things?
Holy s**t
Okay but like what if your phone dies
Will you do a follow up soon?
Can&#39;t believe I got this recommended .. unboxing a card.
<b>Imagine someone stole his card and take a photo of him and use his face ID to buy something online.</b>
Pls do a video of Google cards too, marques.
I love my trove wallet
waiting for apple to make an actual color-changing physical card.
An Apple Card was the first credit card I got. I had no credit and this card helped me build SOME credit unfortunately it only reports to transunion. Better than nothing in my opinion and unlike a secured credit card I didn’t have to put down any money which is a nice perk. I eventually I got a secured credit card that reports to more credit agencies but I keep the Apple Card cause it does build some credit and more cash back on the App Store and when buying From the Apple website
you use a apple credit card to buy a ANDRIOD DEVICE😂
So basically you put your credit card into your phone so you don&#39;t need to use your credit card, just to get a credit card so you don&#39;t need to use your phone?
Am i watching a chocolate bar staring at me for the first 30 sec...
I thought this thing was gonna be famous but I totally forgot about this shit, lol
Does it come with apple stickers?
Apple really wants to take over the world
&quot;I don&#39;t know who&#39;s spending that much money on apple...&quot; <br><br><br>~10k iMac Pro in background and spends ~30k on Mac Pro
They should call it Icard
<b>I want one because i have my mom credit card in apple pay and there is a lot of places where i go were they don’t accept apple pay</b>
Unless they do have your face.... I’ve seen way too many sci fi movies
Man I didn’t know Apple had a it’s own credit card 💳
Very good sir apple card 👍👍👍👍
Buying a samsung product from an apple card 🤣🤣.. Nicee i like it
But the question is can you used it in ATM ?
How to get that apple card
Imagine an apple debit card that costs 10x the  amount you can deposit.

Can&#39;t believe you saying that. Obviously anyone who doesn&#39;t own an Apple product will buy such stuff, and for people who do buy Apple products WANT to get &#39;trapped&#39; in the Apple ecosystem. They only reason most Apple users use either Android or Windows because of gaming.
Apple card??... I though it was iCard😂

wondering hows the card after 8 months now? worn off?

Oh yeah droeloe!!!
Credit cards in the us are stone age shit. I feel like we&#39;ve had NFC technology in credit cards for nearly a decade in the uk. It feels like apple doing credit card feels like a weird tech all considering

I just noticed how every mkbhd title has an “!”
The apple ecosystem is getting scary ngl, glad both my stepfather andbiological father hate Apple with a passion
Still waiting for it to be in Canada.
Wow I can’t wait till they make the new one with a camera I’m definitely going to get that one
They should make a Space Gray color.
This dude just really used his Apple Card for the first time..... to buy a Samsung.... what a savage 😂
6.9k dislikes
I love how we’re calling a credit card “hardware.”
What does MKBHD means
Marques: even if they have your credit card they don’t have your iphone .. and even if they had your iphone they don’t have your face.                <br>Me: Texas chainsaw massacre flashback while sweating and breathing heavily
Never gonna spend $999 for a credit card
<b>That&#39;s cool BUT can it run Minecraft?</b>
Marques: idk who would spend that much on Apple. <br>Also Marques: spends 50,000+ on Mac Pro.
Why
The intro music is kinda addicting. I keep coming back here just for that ;_;
The reason Im not trapped in the eco system is cuz I dont remember my Icloud password (cant even logout anymore) and Im broke
When Apple is going to make money?
It needs wireless charging and a glowing Apple logo.
The true reason it has no numbers n the front or back is not for design or security, its so you can post it online and flex
I think its useless!
He is Black and has more Apple Produkts Then me???? WHATS WRONG WITH THE WORLD (im white)

Samsung punching the air rn
This another kind of flex
And how much will it cost in the uk
When is the apple credit card will come out in uk
What if the card cuts you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=273">4:33</a> what about twins lol.
I got it and got rid of it that same month. I didn’t realize that it doesn’t sync with budgeting apps like mint plus the benefits of the card sucks
only thing useful from this card is that 3% on apple Hermes
Can you get one of these just to own it then not activate it? Is there any hidden Requirements? I have good Credit and know id be approved for it but I would not use it just own it to have it
Anyone who sees this who can answer can you get one of these just to own it then not use it? Says no Annual fees what happens if you don’t even activate it? I just want to own it
He got approval for $10,000 credit? mine is $500 lol.
I got mine a couple months ago and I still love seeing people’s reactions when I pull it out to buy something.
How much does this cost?
You mean you don&#39;t have a Prime card?
So you&#39;re telling me my man just unboxed an Apple credit card and used his first purchase on a Samsung? This man is wild haha

Stop flexing 😤😤😤
Why? Apple just why?
Can i have $200 pls?
Buying Samsung with Apple Is one of the greatest flex we have seen in for a while
Lmao my ass got denied. Fuck it 🤷🏾‍♂️ rich ass shit
youtube keeps on raping the quality of the videos
He bought a samsung phone with the apple credit card. <b>ABSOLUTE CHAD</b>
&quot;flex of the decade&quot; well the decade is over.
This video probably wasn&#39;t necessary.
Anyways, I&#39;m happy being trapped in the Apple ecosystem. At least it provides us all with high-quality products and services.
Flexing hard there, Marques
A card to spend money on Apple Products.
Even if they have your phone, they don’t have their face.<br>😂😂😂😂😂

I love this card!
Just by looking at the card unboxing i can instantly tell i have not been approved.
if you lose it they will make you pay another 1000 dollars. i dont know im just guessing since its Apple and they hate costumers.
Backed by Goldman Sachs ??? no way gonna subscribe to Apple card
What do you mean they can’t use your card if they steal it? The card doesn’t know who is holding it. Unless it has a hidden camera built within the thin piece of titanium that spies on you
If you can&#39;t open a beer with the card no good for me.
Apple is very smart. This is a very smart product!!<br>It&#39;s another way to prevent their customers from leaving their ecosystem.<br>Damn that is smart...
&quot;I&#39;ll be here!&quot;
It actually looks pretty cool, I would have one 🤘🐷
It seems like all the tech on the card already exists, or am I wrong?
No headphone jack? They removed the screen too huh?
Marques “great credit” Brownlee
2008 economy crash, link to owner of card
The fact your credit limit is 10,000 that’s a flex
Cool
Why are you unboxing a credit card?   We&#39;re doomed as a society.
Looks like a key card for employees.
U apple fanboys really do be paying anything nowadays 🙄🙄
Swear he says “Ka B HD” when saying his name
A metal credit card...what the hell
That’s hot that’s hot

Plot twist: it automatically pays for the new iphone and ships it to your house<br>(Feature cannot be turned off)
1% cashback is shockingly bad.
I thought he was going to impersonate a credit card. Click bate -_-
Us Australians have had these features for years. How can you guys be so behind the curb?
Your tin foil hat is getting tighter every year. You seriously think a company develops a credit card with the primary intent of keeping you in their ecosystem? No company can deliver the amount of experience and detail this credit card product experience has, AS YOU EXEMPLIFIED IN YOUR REVIEW, without having full control of the end-to-end experience, as only Apple has. But please keep talking about the walled garden and headphone jacks.
As a fast food cashier, the most noticeable and weird thing is how thick and heavy it is
Good luck trying to cut that thing
Why don&#39;t you tell me the magic numbers on this card?
Can you do a review of the Sirin Finney?
When yt gives Samsung ad on apple ved......
The actual card should change color
Now you can put a dbrand skin on your credit card and your Tesla cybertruck
So...what is the reason to use this thing? Instead of a better, cheaper credit card or, even better, a debit card?
I mean if Apple does the 6% every year then that&#39;s a thing, you can also finance an iPhone with that card and pay no interests.
Why does it sound like he&#39;s saying kbhd not mkbhd

Marques BRAINWASHED Brownlee
Given that I&#39;m already invested in the  ecosystem that is not an issue to me. I hate Google, so no Android here. It&#39;s living in Australia that sucks. Not really, this place is great, but we are way behind on this stuff.

Fortnite and <b>MARQUES BROWNLEE</b>
yeah totally disappointed the actual card didn&#39;t change colour
Casually puts 10k on the card for no reason
So how do you select a different card to use?
I am completely okay with being &quot;trapped&quot; in the Apple ecosystem. Apple does everything I need. I plan to get a used iPhone soon to replace my cheap Sony phone, and I see no reason I would ever need to go back to android. Android has zero special features that make it worth more than an iPhone to me. I have loved my 2017 MBP since I got it, and it does all I need it to, and much better than any other computer I have ever owned. The ecosystem is wonderful. Having everything work so well together is why I have started to like Apple more and more. Everything is super simple and easy.
How much money do you make with 10 million subscribers? :P
Say Apple&#39;s better and receive a GiFT ! 😅😅😅
$10,000 credit limit 😭

they should put a thing in the apple watches or something new , a installation where the parent for example can tell siri to alarm in 2 hours and then show a map that shows where u are and the safest way home automatically for the kid  when the kids are outside or playing somewhere . or if u think u will be lost while going somewhwre u have siri to show u the map home 1 min after the alarm and if u dont answer they call ur friends and family and shows them a map where u went and they can call the cops

Why poor people always hate on apple product..? I’m just curious
I’m already trapped in the Apple ecosystem. I am an iPhone user since the 3GS and when I got the 6 I decided I wanted to try Samsung, I got the Note 4 and I hated it. Now I’m using an iPhone XR.

I wonder if Otterbox will make a case for it? Lol <br>I just got mine today and I have to say, it’s pretty cool looking!
The only way it’s worth it is for purchasing Apple products (3% cash back, but still if you have the amazon card that gives you 5% cash back so if the Apple product is available on amazon it’s STILL useless) or when a store has Apple Pay for 2% (at which point it’s better to just pay with the wallet app). So basically I have it sitting in my closet so I’m not worried about how it will wear. It’s good to increase your available credit though because they give you a ton of money (since they want you to buy Apple products with it) for instance I usually get offered $1000 credit limit AT MOST because of my age, and they offered me $2,500

But you just explained why it&#39;s LESS durable in the very sentence before you claimed it was more durable. Sorry but it&#39;s just too obvious that plastic is the way to go. The metal will show scratches much more and most people don&#39;t like making their wallets more rigid than they have to. The metal is a total deal breaker. And I don&#39;t know why you would publicly admit that you have more than one credit card.
I thot, they are giving you away all those phone for free just for reviewing their products!!
Tim Cuck dropping the ball again. The card should have given you 5% back on all apple purchases online and in store, 3% across the board for everything when you pay with apple pay and 2% across the board for everything when you pay with the physical card.
Does it have dark mode?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj7kFBz-jw4&amp;t=240">4:00</a> dude just tossed a light 10 grand on the card
Crapple trash for isuckers
How does it work at my local store? Are you only able to purchase online with this card or does it work anywhere? If there is no card number or anything do you still dont have any pin code when purchasing in a physical store?
The apr is through the roof fyi
love the resolution
Goldman sachs has raped our financial system.  Shame on you.
Enjoy your debt.
I think this is the first video I watched of yours since my YouTube analytics said it was recommending my videos and decided to check it out. My jaw dropped when I saw those subs and realized how on earth have I not heard of your channel previously. I was missing out!
Buying a Samsung product with a apple card<br><br><br>That&#39;s some big D energy
Is it able to act as a debit card
If you&#39;re going to spend that kinda cash on a new credit card might as well go with AMEX and get free hotels and air fair while you&#39;re at it, just to name a few. The perks they give for being a member completely makes apple&#39; s out to be a joke when compared. Why go with a credit company that is just barely starting out that is the worst time to join. You can bet they will be tacking on Fees out the whazzooo. One last thing, titanium cards are nothing new just ask AMEX. ; )
Do you have to scan your driver&#39;s liscence? or enter it? my camera is broken but I want this so bad
