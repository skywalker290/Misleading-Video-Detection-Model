Can I borrow the phone for a minute? I need to.... um... make a phone call...
Why didn&#39;t they design the joints in the three pieces of glass to act as finger placement for the buttons? They wouldn&#39;t obscure anything, and they would actually provide some form of haptics. Which would have mitigated the issue with accessing the power button and volume rockers. Missed opportunity there.
imagine getting a water droplet on that phone. No matter where it goes your screwed
When he mentioned the like button, a glowing ring appeared around it. Since when has that been a feature?
I still dream of this phone. It&#39;s 2024, it&#39;s time for someone to make this a reality.
Looking at this with the flip phones in my mind, it doesn&#39;t seem as weird as it thought about it back then. Widgets, notifications and the back cameras for selfies on the back are kinda basic and loved looking at those flip phones.
😩
one drop and its gone...
That will be the design for samsung galaxy s26 and iphone pro 17
how is gonna bro play brawlstars
imagine dropping it
Literally what you&#39;d find in Google when search iphone 7 or iphone 10 back in the day
Wait, didn&#39;t realize it was uploaded 3 years ago, what happened to this phone now? Have they been selling it? Never heard of it??
Xiaomi Corporation is sponsoring the military aggression of a terrorist state
Looks cool, but there are few (if any) practical uses. And I assume the back screen would stay off 95% of the time to preserve battery, which defeats the entire purpose. Unlike a flip phone, the added screen doesn&#39;t actually allow you to have a larger screen, since you can&#39;t use both sides simultaneously. I assume the main benefit of this design is that you could see incoming notifications no matter how the phone is sitting. But the same thing could be achieved with a small screen on the back, like the Z Flip.
This Phone looks amazing but at the same time I find it a little funny because it reminds me of all the fake iPhone leaks we saw when we were kids lol<br>other than that, pretty cool tech!
i would immediatley discard my iphone for this device if given the opportunity
titanium in 2021 wow
Can I have the phone please for m husband . ❤❤
Hey Marques, can you please tell me if I can buy one yet or is it still unreleased? Seeing some ads selling it. I would like to have one but I don&#39;t wanna lose money. Thank you.
I&#39;d like to buy this but I have Galaxy series phones
100% beleza 0% funcionabilidade
Extremely minimalistic
Awesome! Cudos, Xiaomi!
Watching this on a Xiaomi 💀💀💀💀💀
still amazing specs in 2024
Is it possible to buy the same phone prototype mi mix alpha.. 🙏✌️
mi used titanium before it was a thing
titanium?
OK when will we have a full glass, full wrap, full touch screen, and foldable phone?  CUZ id be excited for that... the new Flip 5 excited me with the partial font... but I want a fully (windows 11  !! ish !! ) functional phone... I want a phone that is a phone sized  as a mobile PC with virtual wireless extended screen that can go to AR devices (that will hold native resolution) or just another physical screen. how much longer do I have to wait? 10 more year? ill be dead in like 30. I would rather the spent more time on AR and AR devices... VR is going to be a unprofitable shit show for a long time... AR is the way to give people what they want in the current tech situation and ability... IMO.
i d nevver buy stuffs like this cause ..repairability is a bad joke
This is a terrible idea we&#39;ve already seen from Samsung That even slightly curved screens are terrible when it comes to durability, This thing&#39;s gonna shatter the moment it hits anything
thats how iphone had too look in 2017
I&#39;m deeply impressed by this. I had the pleasure of reading something similar, and it left a deep impression on me. &quot;The Art of Meaningful Relationships in the 21st Century&quot; by Leo Flint
Why don’t other companies don’t show off cool prototypes like this to us I really would love to have that phone tho 😅
Where is the volume up and volume down button?
Did nobody else notice the android move shelves in the beginning? Lol
A repairability nightmare
DO NOT DROP IT AT ALL COSTS
What about this phone cover 😅
Imagine pubg triggers are on back screen
If you drop this
Cool but useless.. and not safe😂 u can&#39;t put the case
Just one Drop and ........... your are free to buy another one
Mobile cover&#39;s company 🤡
How are we gonna take care of the scratches?
Yeah it&#39;s really awesome I will surely get one if they make a product like this
Looks like a concept design from 2009 lol
If necessary was a phone
So Xiaomi used titanium way back and it got no news that time and apple jus recently used it and took limelight
Bagai mana cara beli nya bang
Am I the only one to notice dust<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
How’d you do that with the like button??
This phone reminds me of samsung note 4 edge
so sad this concept died...  was the first phone i wouldnt mind spending 1200$+ for
imagine a case for that 💀💀
POV 2019 : omg its the new iphone 15 <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
awesome, I hate it. It just seems uncomfortable... so scratchy, impossible to repair, battery life HAS to be atrocious.
The idea could spawn the thought of lookless touch like having spots on the back that can be anchored and allow you to do things like take a photos or open a app or play a game like a controller or maybe even reinvent the way you type messages with holding the phone in a way that lets you use the back to type some or all. It&#39;s so early and a lot of what I said here is so Vanilla I bet there is so much having a touch screen on the back allow you to do. Also maybe have a case that is like a garage door that can slide to the front or back around the edge so that you can cover one part but easily look at the back or front too also have the door removable! I love it but idk I ill even want it!
Is it buyable now ?
Useless, but pretty beautiful
Представьте только сколько он сейчас стоит! Это лютый раритет. Один из самых редких смартфонов.
smartphones are doing everything but producing actually usable features which actually matters , like removing heat from the phones , making software more smooth and bug free or making network seamless to use ,  making phone last much longer and easily replaceable , rather than uploading stupid software updates to make phone unusable just for increasing sales , quality software updates , connectivity with windows laptop better .<br><br>These things actually matters to users not the fuking 360 view which is pretty much useless apart from taking selfie.
Literally they brought the Titanium Alloy Frame in use way back before Apple😂
I thought screen protectors on my curved S10 are annyoing <br>😂
So that&#39;s also means Xiaomi was first to adopt titanium in there smartphone.<br>😗
apple has to do some concepts like this
I wonder why they didn&#39;t integrate a place on the side of the case to hold the phone. Wouldn&#39;t that help with accidental touches
damn
Why this phone is amazing: the screen<br>Why this phone is not amazing: the screen
360° screen 💀 but nice build 👍🏻
It’s cool but how do you use a case, basically don’t drop this thing. 😂
imagine the fingerprints you are going to leave on that phone a true nightmare
Not necessary  mi mix technology &amp; not necessary  your vlog😅
You can only drop it once..
that&#39;s fucking cool, never even heard about it! to bad it got cancelled because of the complex manufacturing process!
My main question is what type of a screen protector / case could I possibly put it into, because I definitely do not see myself using it without one, it&#39;s just too risky, no matter how cool it seems.
android people be like:
Bruh this the S22/S23/S24 Ultra 🤣
now its time for huawei to rebuild again its magic self phones🤫
ah yes the cases are nonexistent
i think xaomi saw apple and smasung skring there boxes and decided they wanted to go bigger to be different
Now we can have a separate wallpaper for the back too.
bro why some of phones are copying styles even s24 ultra gonna copy titanium from iphone without permission
Imagine a screen protector😂
Man how I wish this was available on eBay or something id scoop
this is samsung old design way back 2017
When I notice a 69 in the thumbnail, I click it faster than 3*10^8 m/s  [c]
Woah😮😅
Question is why? There&#39;s no possible practical reason to even think up such a concept.
How are you going to put a case in that?
Only 855 . . . . . snapdragon chipset. It&#39;s to low
Looks cool and all... But why would I want to have a screen lighted on the back of my phone showing up stuff I&#39;m not looking at and draining battery like 2 screens? Asides from the showing-off factor there&#39;s nothing more to it
Its 2024. Sell it you cowards.
Wow - this is beautiful!
How do you replace the screen if broken
My Sony Ericsson Walkman W300 From 2006
Good concept but I think future is in expendables, or at least it should be. Something that triple-ups: Phone, Tablet, &amp; a proper Computer - all in one.
<b>Mi 11 Ultra has left the chat</b>
Markass Brownies<br>Never forgetti.
2024: stil useless
Nice... now you can break the screen no matter the angle it hits the ground! Genius
I still really like this design hey.
it would ruin my day if i drop that
a Phone that trust the user way too much
Damit why do they always make nice phones so expensive. Im good with just 4 gb ram and 128 storage. For anything more ill just use my computer
The link for the phone does not work. Gives me an 404.
Futuristic
what if you drop it accidentally
Innovation is cool and important but sometimes, just because you can doesn&#39;t mean you should.
Would be cool if it unrolled/opened up.
Looks like a cassette tape cover
I thought it was a vape for a second, sorry
finally someone did something cool with wrap around screens. I hate those folding phones
2.85
What is personal in it 😑
its nightmare to repair this thing and baterry only 4k mamps mehhhhh
Jesus I need this now
COD3 phone skins
I want to buy a pixel 6a 128 gb cause I need more memory is still good to buy ? Am be waiting for you respond  thanks 😊
Just imagine taking that in to a normal phone repair shop.
This phone would be great for people in zero-gravity environments.
It’s beautiful and I want it. I don’t care if it doesn’t work too well it’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.
This type of concept phone should keep up today, it would be cool.
Just gorgeous
iPhone 10 in 2013
Here is the case: |
I watched this when it was new... and now its recommended to me 3 years later. This is the way of the algorithm.
Mi Mix Alpha Site 404 Error
I wanted to see how it looked playing a youtube video
That freedom of a second after you do it when you think, &quot;I hope it doesn&#39;t land of the scree...&quot;
Finally, a wrap around screen phone that will never be made, and that&#39;s fine.
I kinda like it. I like samsungs curved edge display. This is just an evolution of that. Great spot for basic info like battery, maybe weather and notification icons.
funny that phones comes powered on
No way! Battery are gonna ran out sooooo quick :D
Me drops phone <br>phew its just the back my screen is ok <br><br>ME realizes opps
thanks for telling us that something is electromagnetic even if it is usually 😘
No reason.... Curved screens are horrible, crack very very easy.. but yes it is cool
LOOKS AMAZING but what happens if you drop it 😬
No matter how you drop this on the floor, you will still manage to hit the display
Smartphones are overated
I would never buy it. Too touchy, fragile, I guess too expensive to repair, impractical when you&#39;re trying to touch it on a surface as it moves. Also when you&#39;re not using the other half of the screen it would consume the battery. A button that is responsive less than 100%of the time is useless  (the volume and the entire screen as you said sometimes is non responsive). The latest Samsung phones with curved edges already annoy me because it&#39;s too touchy and I believe Samsung has that because it breaks easily and it&#39;s very expensive to replace that nonsense screen. I have never broken any phone screen except the Samsung I have, I broke it twice. I&#39;m just waiting a Samsung new top of the notch model release to be no curved to buy it
casually uses apple pencil as a wedge
got this recommended today after 3 years lol
It&#39;s cool, but given you cant get a screen case that works that well with the aesthetic, on top of the lack of physical side buttons kind of kills it for me. I love the innovation, however.
the back would make a great camera viewfinder, not for the person taking the picture/video, but for the people whose picture is being taken. You&#39;d know if you&#39;re in frame without having to be directed, which is great
Development status: Cancelled
this will be iPhones in 2012
its useless display xD u cant look it in both sides at the same time xD
I WANT ONE
I would love to try and replace that screen lol
it looks amazing. i hope that this technology will be use in future phones. i&#39;d want phone like this
Drop the phone and I say what i think about this
Unlocked Orion on his phone
See, Vivo actually did a phone with EXACTLY this kinda setup in mind called the Vivo NEX Dual Display. Didn&#39;t have the wraparound screen, but it had the major screen where you do your usual stuff and a screen on the back that allowed you to just have only the one better camera setup.<br><br>I&#39;m honestly surprised that this idea wasn&#39;t explored that much more until just now. I think I&#39;d still prefer it if it wasn&#39;t given that this sounds like an absolute nightmare to repair, but it&#39;s still neat that this kind of configuration is being explored.<br><br>But tbh, I still don&#39;t really see myself replacing my current phone with anything that doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack. I&#39;ve honestly grown really tired of not having one on my device, call me a bitter old curmudgeon about it. I&#39;ve tried time and time again to get used to Bluetooth, which is convenient, but it&#39;s very much INCONVENIENT when it decides it doesn&#39;t wanna work.<br><br>Oh, and no physical buttons for volume and power is a huge No for me. I still think OnePlus has the best setup with those where it had the switch to automatically silence your phone, and that&#39;s really something that should have been bog standard at this point.
Battery speedrun!
I don&#39;t know why at least Some companies aren&#39;t trying to Have a Sapphire display cover/screen on the cell phones. This would be the end game scratch-resistance on the cell phones that the world needs. <br>But,there probably Is a significant reason for it that I simply don&#39;t know.
I watched it on December 2023 but still impressed with the innovation! I thought it was released on 2023!
you&#39;re worried to break your screen ? no problem here&#39;s another screen to worry about<br>the most useless thing I&#39;ve seen today<br>thank you for the review anyway
Fake iPhone 6 videos be like
I don&#39;t see why anyone is surprised. We already had a phone screen that can fold in half, wrapping it around the edge should&#39;ve been no problem! Looks cool though.
Cover Manufacturers:<br>ಥ_ಥ
Really important
Well I can it&#39;s nice idea but they should find better reasons for the curved display other wise it will be of no use 😊
the song when he starts unboxing is called Lanjutkan by Sigit Jackson
I&#39;m sure the case manufacturers are gonna have a field day with this 😅
The repairing costs😅😅😅
This is the first time I am seeing you doing a Xiaomi
HOW DO YOU DO THAT LIKE BUTTON ANIMATION?!?!?!?
no.
how tf do u click bereals
Hold on a sec, since when does this thing with the like button work...?
Back in the day, when @mkbhd talked about something else than apple … at least sometimes
lmao Sony gonna sue em for that Alpha branding
is it really pronounced as SHAomi?
Please show us a call of duty gameplay....on behalf of all the gamers that are watching 😊.....we wanna see how smooth that processor❤ is
Bro, The way that the like button highlights when you ask for a like is sick. First time I&#39;ve ever seen that.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn&#39;t stop to think if they should.
Self-camera is useless in messengers.
Another Chinese gadget, which exaggerates on things that don&#39;t matter...apart from the futuristic look, this screen makes no sense
put a case on it lol
Practically useless and cumbersome.. just good for looks to generate hype
My Tecno 7 &quot; 7000 mah phone Blows it away.
So... no case?
Extremely cool tech. But it seems like in an exercise in creating a phone you cannot protect from fall damage.
why did this video appear in my feed now ?
Did this ever come to Indian market? I would love to own one of those.. 😅
I think this is way cooler than foldable phones...
Nice 👍 phone 📱 so ❤ beautiful 😍
How can l get the phone
This was three years ago....
Unbilivalbe 😮😮😮
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=494">8:14</a> so if u use this phone while lying down on bed on our back and hold phone holding up, the phone would think &quot;oh im upside down, i should turn on my widgets&quot;...that would be annoying
ahh always the chinese with crazy ideas...dont get me wrong im not saying their ideas are stupid im not even a tech expert so idk...instead its actually cool they launch some crazy tech..while the rest of the companies are launching the same old looking tech just with better performance so they dont risk on their sales, china there releasing futuristic looking tech that even if it fails to make a profit, im sure it would motivate or give more awesome ideas to those inventors and engineers out there
Battery kitna ghanta chalta hai
The most important question is: Why?
i need this phone  give me
BRO PACK A PUNCHED HIS PHONE
its crazy to see Xiaomi used the titanium body which apple launched recently
The best thumbnail of the channel.
@GadgetIn menarik nih bg....
Breakable and hard to hold and use at the same time (because of the cruved edges)
My like button just lit up when he said „likebutton“. Wtf?
🔥🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=68">1:08</a> like button glows up when you say like button that&#39;s why you say that&#39;s pretty sick ..........................................dayum that&#39;s pretty slickk...
I still want this...
What is the screen to body ratio
Can you buy this phone and where?
They took fullscreen to a whole another level
Kaluuu madari aaya
Why the hell did my like button just glow?! 😮 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=68">1:08</a>
Why does the thumbnail show 69%💀💀
i really wish they would have actually released this phone i would have 100% bought it !!!
Why?
imagine buying this and putting a coloured cover on it
This phone never came out
making the screen out of glass is a terrible idea for this phone
Amazing Chinese phone brand. So unique display
My note 20 ultra have a better cpu though and better battery I thought this xiaomi is better at these points but, the idea of this phone got me impressed:)
this is the first time I say it, but I honestly think this is the future of phones, maybe a distant future, but still the future
make a revision like: a drawer internals solution, extra thick sapphire glass protection and a wrap-around case
I saw this phone in my dream
if you drop it its gonna be a critical hit
Imagine the front and back are same and you can use it from any side
My intuition is telling me there&#39;ll be better days....<br>Cole Change
is this available?😢
it&#39;s amazing
Atleast sum phone brands arent scared to explore compared to other competitors
Honestly, what’s your asking price for this? I thought this was a pass in 2018 or 2019 when it was first on my radar but it’s been haunting me ever since.
imagine watching 18+ videos 😂😂😂
Hell yeah🎉
why does the like button shine lol
How when he said Like button, the like button on YouTube just got a glow ???
Alt title: The most fragile phone ever since the iPhone X
This video is 3yrs old😅
Smart but display can be costy
Looks cool but I drop my phone a lot, I wouldn&#39;t risk it
If its heavy i don&#39;t want it..
In real world its not a ideal phone
Prone to scratches😢 especially when you put it on the table..
yo the like button turned LGBTRGBQ guyss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=67">1:07</a>
Xiaomi was way ahead of its time. They gave titanium build with wrapping screen.
Haha deng
what is the price for the cellphone?
Imagine a case for that
why da android playin portal 😭😭😭
I love Xiaomi phones, but it&#39;s UI kind of weird and bloatware.
for me they should make it like thin side cut off off the screen.. no need for the full wrap screen at the side if they make it back and front screen toucheable  and usable thats great
This phone is out of existence🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
i really want that phone
It&#39;s time to launch this type of phone to the market, Xiaomi! Be it dirt costly, but launch it dammit.
the screen protector 💀
its really cool in all but it does not meet standard because as u said its functionality is low.On the however side its nice since its unique.
I was waiting for you to say the phone can be invisible too 😂
3D touch would be good for those buttons.
is it coming or not?
Can I get a cover case along with the phone😅😅😂
It&#39;s stupid because I can&#39;t get one
Definitely NSFW for browsing lol😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=225">3:45</a> is where the review starts for everyone that wants to skip unnecessary place holders
Love the phone reviews
I still want this
You know what they should&#39;ve done with a phone like that, is make a little push pop out button that allows you to easily hook up a wrist strap to. Like the old I pod touch 5th gen had. Then you wouldn&#39;t drop it, and you could hook it up to your belt loop when not in use
This phone doesn&#39;t fall
Imagine this beauty with a parallax wallpaper. This actually makes way more sense than a phone that folds. We should be able to use the rear camera as a front facing camera by now. Get rid of the front camera completely, we don&#39;t need it!
Watching hub and it flips around
There is (NOO WAY) for this phone to lay flat,&#39;&#39; Flips phone on front screen&#39;&#39;! 😂😅 lmao 🤣
I remember using this phone at redmi 8 launch event. They had just shown the prototype at the Xiaomi office and the display was very lovely. I still remember how mesmerized i was even after 3 years.
Where is the music from ?
I wish this had actually came out. Super cool!
absolutely sick, useless tho
What about video calls how to make videos on what&#39;s app?
It&#39;ll be much cooler if you can set the home wallpaper with what the camera is facing. So that makes it look like the phone is transparent
One of the coolest designs ive ever seen but totally impractical.
Massage gun xiaomi review?
&gt;liquid power filling the phone<br>...uhhh dude, samsung did that back for the note 2 or 4. can&#39;t remember which.
I believe it would be better if they split the touch screen inmaybe 4 peaces back ,frante and sides sow when you&#39;re holding you&#39;re phone the back of it is eliminating with fancy colors but the tootch will be  disabled  also the same for the sides +if the camera strip just faded with screen so there is only punch holes for the cameras and the flash which will increase the screane to body ratio a lote and it will make ite easy for the protection so the technology of the flexible screens it would be helpful to wrap it a flexible screen protection like in the series in samsung and adding like rubbery caps from the top and the bottom<br>And igess thats all what i got to say <br>Also i am enjoying watching you&#39;re videos so 👍
The only thing I am concerned about how to place tempered glass around it to safeguard its screen.
Iphone users: still using androids??<br><br>Me: still using dusty iphones?
Can you imagine looking at twitter and everyone around you is in shock?!😅
It’s grt Xiaomi should release this phone only problem is thick it should slim as much as possible before release
What is the wallpaper?
iPhone gang
Would be even more awesome if the battery acts like water with gravity when it&#39;s picked up
No problem when watching porn sites appear behind too
But,,, why
Lnbbb <br><br><br><br><br>Molp BB
Most people have a mixed reaction to this insane phone
what would the case look like?? 😂
I ❤ this guy
looks bullshit
This phone seems good
one fall and your 2500 euros are gone.
Hey Marques, do you sell phones from your collections!
Service centre : U need to change the display and back panel<br>iPhone users: Oh, Ok.<br>Alpha users : Are u sure?
I just want the wallpaper 🥲 still can&#39;t find it, or is that part of the OS?
Its An Illusionary 5D Phone
Wow Great
Bet the glass is protecting that titanium alloy frame....great idea
DROP IT
so its pronounced &quot;shawmee&quot; not &quot;Ziyawmee&quot;
Do you use a case for the back or a screen protector??
What typa screen guard would be needed for it ?
all fun and games until your screen cracks
Just teleported to lower rack😄😄
يتحطله كفر ازاي دا يعني
But you can&#39;t put a phone case on it
The trick with the volume Button is: <br>You must doubletap and hold, and dann you can scroll up or down.
Remember this phone
He knew what he was doing with the thumbnail
how can get it
how to you put on a case?
Naaa...i definitely dont need people infront of me looking at my screen...
if you drop the phone .... its game over
rip when we drop the phone 🤡
He always favours apple
Nobody:<br><br>Thumnail:&quot;shows 69%&quot;<br><br>Me:&quot;clicks&quot;
Imagine having to put a screen protector on this thing
Imagine looking for a screen protector😅
This will totally revolutionize the experience of watching pron on the subway
Repairability score: -2/10
Who else noticed the thumbnail 💀
Alpha impressions
thank God this didn&#39;t release. imagine trying to repair this thing! Also, how tf would you protect this with a case?!
اسمو بالعربي
if that does release how is the repair its not possible because of the full display
Marques, being as you’re the whitest man alive. You’re heavy use of the rap beats in the video is cultural appropriation.
alternate title: &quot;the most breakable phone ever&quot;
everyone talking about the phone, but wtf happened to that little robot in the background? 😭
Needs some small details improvements
ok imma be real what if a clumsy person buy this phone 💀
No headphone jack ill pass...
i really hope right to repair goes through
my dream phone
Couldn&#39;t they just make the sides non-capacitive? Having it all touch screen doesn&#39;t seem so practical
looks like the huawei mate x when closed
That is uh, obnoxiously cool. Shame xiaomi never released it!
Drop it and then the whole phone will break
They put a fucking black ops camo on my phone
iPhone 15 concept videos back in 2010 weren&#39;t wrong about the future
Absolutely useless
Not the best phone to watch porn in the public.
Looks like the phone from aliexpress ads 💀
Ok I&#39;m just gonna say it...I want this
If you drop it...
no way thats a prototype
The thumbnail 💀💀💀
imagine watching porn, not knowing the person in front of you can also see it
Oppening a case with a iPencil
Imagine cracking the screen though…
Such screen and any other new feature is good when it solve problems, what problem can solve screen that I can&#39;t see? For me its &quot;we can do it&quot; market phone
Can&#39;t be a consumer product. Just could be something for xiaomi pr.
why does the thumbnail have charging percentage on 69% 😏🤣
This screams: PFFFT who needs custom cases, when can have background instead?
Call video with the phone 😮😮😮
I cannot use this phone. I pick up the phone and drop it on the floor. Then I look at the broken screen and cry
I mean, beside taking a selfie there’s really no use to the back screen. Sure they relocated some ui elements to have a cleaner home screen but… well, in a few words I wouldn’t be surprised if the phone flopped.<br>Edit: I checked and yep, never made it to the market. <b>you don’t say</b>
More area for my phone to crack!
Cameras can be housed on the top edge of the phone, that way we can look down on the screen, point the top edge to shoot photos…that way, even the back is full screen…
Hey, doubt anyone will actually see this. But this one guy called &quot;Happy Vibes&quot; is stealing a bunch of Marques&#39; videos, including this one
how did that robot move down the rack ??? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=5">00:05</a>
Futuristic phone bro
Curved glass presents too many problems to be worth it to me. After going through the experience of not being able to protect my Pixel 6 Pro with a tempered glass protector, breaking the screen, having buy a replacement and repair it. Flat glass is just better.<br><br>This phone is just that nightmare scenario turned up to 11. No thanks...
Yeah<br><br><br><br>Nope.
Dude repping racist terrorist blm lol they spent millions on drag queens. Strippers. Phone operators etc trash
Repairing this phone would be an absolute nightmare
-me: use a solid black background<br>this phone:  😐
What’s going to happen to cases
How will i take this phone to washroom
Got recommended this, thought it was current year. This was 2 years ago
It also has a nickname: &quot;Finger prints galore&quot;
This is neat tech and all, but I think we have long forgotten the actual reason for these things to exist. To be a phone. I just struggle to see the reason something like this has to exist. It&#39;s absolutely mind blowing tech and you&#39;d be the man if you whipped this out on the bus. It&#39;s a neat gimmick but a gimmick none the less. I had an iPhone 13 pro and while yes it was fast, had a cool screen, and had shiny sides, the call quality was mediocre at best. I got so sick of social media and the shitstorm of a world we live in that I switched to a flip phone that cost $30 and it&#39;s call quality was unmatched. What good is all those cool features and gimmicks if the sole reason you have to carry that device is defeated. I&#39;m not attacking anyone who sees these devices in a different light. We are lucky to have the technology we do and if implemented correctly, it makes life way easier. I just hate to see something skew so far from its original purpose. When he mentions in the video, &quot;so what is the back screen for? The status bar is moved to the side to make it more clean looking, and for cool factor&quot;. I would rather see the r&amp;d team focus on how to enhance more important aspects of a device like making a more intuitive touch interface. I fail to understand why we still have an emulated mechanical QWERTY keyboard on a flat surface with no dexterity. While I don&#39;t have the answer to that problem, it&#39;s something that would be interesting to see. Technology companies are trying too hard and instead of implementing new useful ways to implement the tech we have, they push forward with new concepts and ideas that really have no purpose. The best example I can provide on my viewpoint is like an electric car that has so many features and gimmicks that use battery and as a result, the car has a maximum range of 73 miles. The car has the best battery tech available at the time and is already equipped with the maximum amount of batteries possible. The problem is that the battery tech isn&#39;t advanced enough to supply the needs of the car. Essentially it&#39;s ahead of its time and it defeats its own purpose. Tech is so outstandingly good nowadays but we don&#39;t know how to implement it usefully. Technology is ahead of its time...
It’s not an iPhone so it’s lame
i personally hate it.
&quot;Heywa tsap guys, am kabeech dee here.&quot;
Ugly phone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=178">2:58</a> is see you
Wow powerbank with a apps on it
Imagine dropping it
Xiaomi is a good company. They can make good phones that can be useable for four and five years. However, they need to do something with their software. It&#39;s too Chinese for me to use comfortably.
Hey Huawei you don&#39;t need edges nor full sceen on  the back. Small back screen for selfies and you&#39;re in the business.
In 2022 still one of the best looking ohone
Soooo you have to flip the phone around when you make a video call? No thanks
this design is so far the most bizzare thing i ever seen on the smartphone industry
Me: &quot;Wraps phone in Plastic wrap&quot; <br>&gt;&gt; Screen protector.
imagine when like somebody is looking at your phone and the camera can detect that and it just says &#39;What you lookin at?&#39; on the back😂😂
Sd855+ nowadays can’t even play candy crush
This is a piece of crap for 2800$
It’s like I’m back in 2013
디자인은 삼성보다 훨씬 멋잇네..^^  그런데  일상에서 오랜동안 사용할 수 있는가가 문제이지..
WHERE CAN I AQUIRE ONE?!
They could have easily gone for side double tap for wake and side up or down slide for volume control
Phone is trash how you going to protect if it falls, how is phone case gonna work
POV:<br><br>It&#39;s 2017 and the new iphone &quot;leaks&quot; came out
Absolutely love this idea for a phone. Knock that battery up to 6500 mha (idc if the phone is bigger or thicker- I&#39;d rather have less storage and longer battery life anyways). If you could have a slide-in tube style replaceable clear screen protector as the case, that just has a lid in the shape of the top flat face (that could also make the back strip sink in a be flush)- then who needs a case? The screen protector IS the case. Love the selfie bit too. Only other thing I would say is they could honestly put a button on the side for power or volume. If they can put a break for a button or two and make it as seamless as possible in the middle (side edge) of the screen- then are we really losing that much? If you can still see the screen image in-between the buttons and down the rest of the side of the phone- isn&#39;t that enough?<br><br>That all being said- I love the idea of &quot;re-skinning&quot; your phone with one image change, instead of looking to buy new cases. Pretty fly! Now all we need is an Amoled display, a 120 hz refresh rate, wireless charging and we&#39;re good!
For whatever reason YouTube <b>INSISTED</b> I must watch this video about a device I have never heard of from 2 years ago. No matter how many weeks I have ignored the recommendation it would not give up. ALGORITHM? WHAT ALGORITHM?
cool
I wish I had a phone like that ....maybe one day i will
can you imagine the damage dropping that phone 💀
I guess instead of having to &#39;tap&#39; on the volume function they should have to slide it. The it&#39;d be easier for the software to detect when actually trying to use the feature.
imagine dropping this
Honestly I think this tech will replace folding phones eventually. It&#39;s really the ultimate form factor for a cell phone
I wonder what the protective cases will look like
they made this but it folds open
Visually, it has the wow factor of the Samsung Z series (with about the same about of &quot;but why?&quot;). My first solution to the virtual buttons is why not just do a cutout for the volume and power? It would barely interrupt the screen if they got it tight enough and would provide a far superior user experience. I&#39;m actually pretty excited to see if this makes it to the market as a totally new type of phone to compete with the folding flagships. Not being able to use a case makes me very concerned though. Insurance is going to be really high since screen replacements would probably be so inhibitively expensive that a phone replacement would be easier.
I can&#39;t understand many people still more concern about glass breaking as a priority therefore use screen protectors instead of appreciating this kind of innovative design; dual screen, fordable screens, screen bends all the way round to the back. Even the standard flagship has glass front and back.
whoops accidentally drop my phone hope the screen is not broken oh wait....yeah 😬
Xiaomi Mi Mis: tadahhhhh<br><b>phone cases has left the chat</b>
Privacy friendly and No camera tapes anymore. xD
中国の技術えぐいて
Can&#39;t believe it actually exist...
I really didnt expect them to actually make a rap-around screen phone that works and is as fast as it is, my question is how will phone cases work with the rap-around display?
The only thing I dont like about this phone is that you can only use a clear case.
nice
Love the intro. Fun editing and I love the sound design.
If this screen is miraculously cheaper to replace than <b>other phones</b> I will eat my hat.
some j cole😊
thats a really cool phone, but they have to make a bulletproof glass so people dont have to use a case because of the side screen ://
Uses his apple pen to open the xiaomi phone
its just crazy.
good luck repairing that
what about our privacy ⚠️😆🤷‍♂️
how tf does bereal work on this thing lmao
i need that phone now!!
It isn&#39;t so beautiful in the back.
Does the fact that the phone has a screen all around mean that you can never put it in a protective case and therefore there is a risk of breaking the screen easily?
Imagine you dropped it
2yrs ago but ...
Me: Xiaomi, why not make a phone case<br>Xiaomi: Uh, we can&#39;t do that
the amount of visible fingerprints would be insane..
But why
2000 : &quot;There&#39;s a screen on my phone&quot;<br>2020 : &quot;There&#39;s a phone on my screen&quot;
Looks amazing but... Imagine repair costs 😱
Can I borrow the phone for a minute? I need to.... um... make a phone call...
Pretty sick, but now you definitely have nowhere to put your fingers on! Must retain fingerprints everywhere as well. This is as gimmicky as it gets, I don&#39;t get it. Looks cool though of course.
What color do you want your phone?<br>Yes.
phone cover????
So bloody many apps
The Iphone 14  should have been like this. Lol
if was apple, everybody would be WOWED... but... Apple will use this in 2025 and launch as &quot;inovation&quot; and &quot;never seen before&quot;
Spider App already available for this phone?
To delicate for my clumsy ass😂😂😂
Mmm well, it looks kind of cheap to me, the connectors look awful plastic made even when is not, looks cheap samsung look alike to me. And im sure repair for that would be terrible expensive and does not worth it. Thanks for the vid
#1 reason is charge animation, LOL
funn&gt;&gt;practical it si a good phone with these specs but i dont think it will be useful for daily basis.
Tell me a world where this phone makes sense, or when I might need a screen in the back of my phone.
Imagine a CEO just asking their company to make a one of a kind smartphone for them and for them only that looks like this, and they could ask for software updates on it and shit
congrats, now you can break your phone from any angle
Bro that is so sick
Yes we know, your iphone 14 is better because now it has a dynamic notch, creativity suicide other brands are going to kill the notch, iphone&#39;s is getting bigger, and Apple fans be like wow.
негр
Real quick. <br><br>Who gives a fuck? Us peasants will never get to even see the phone in person. <br><br>Pointless video Marques.
Nah this is way ahead of it’s time
I can’t find the mi mix alpha to buy anywhere even on eBay
I&#39;ll like to see a person put a case on this lol
When you can&#39;t watch PH in public lmao
Flop phone
The thumbnail 69 battery
No phone case buy phone drop phone break screen 😭
Screen protector company be like: Am I a joke to you Shiaomi?
not knowing time is neat?
@gadgetin
It&#39;s like holding a lightsaber. I love this phone
Why the thumbnail
I just found out this video and it’s amazing. Is it available in 2022 now?
Jesus paid the price for our sin debt on the cross, and rose again. Repent and believe the Gospel of your salvation.
id literally buy it right now to replace my Oneplus 6 Red lmao
I wouldn&#39;t buy this phon cause I don&#39;t need  a screen that big im fine with the normal screen
Not cooler than the prototype of Samsung
Уронил один раз - и пиздец телефону 😁 На такой бампер не одеть.
Imagine puting a case on it😅😅
it is fucking amazing. i would solve the side button problem with force touch like older iphones and haptic feedback-like feel so they would be like real buttons. c&#39;mon xiaomi i trust you!
4000mAh isn&#39;t? A bit low? There are a lot a pixels
imagine trying to open and fix this phone
Why is the thumbnail show that the battery perecent is 69
Quite impressive, but wouldn&#39;t go for it. Too fragile, and probably give me a headache using it.
For us right now no. But it is nice to see a comp made a phone that&#39;s out of the box, maybe it will work maybe it won&#39;t for the consumers never know till u try. Just like with the zfold line some people thought they wouldnt like it but now can&#39;t see themselves to switching to another model. Gotta try to see wat work and wat doesn&#39;t kinda cool to see them willing to take risk.
the screen protector companies have been real quiet after seeing this
Shaomi
I missed this review. Did Samsung make this display? It really looks like a good smartphone. A great video brother.
What about the battery usage
phone case companies 😑<br>screen protectors companies 😀
I’m gonna stay away from phones made by Chinese State owned corporations. They are required by the government to turn over any and all data related to you.
Back here again in 2022, still the sexiest phone in the world
Probably the most pointless phone I’ve ever seen
Yo portal reference xd
yup, this phone got cancelled :(
&quot;2 years later&quot;<br>Wait how do u put a case on it WAIT HOW DO U OPEN IT?
It’s useless
Imagine disassembling it... lol how would you even do that?
Just show her your phone, bro
Imagine buying this phone and putting a casing
Thumbnail is ultra nice ngl
Looks good but pointless
is this was released id buy it
Hmm nice thumbnail
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT
Imagine letting this fall
imagine replacing the screen on this... cause you clearly can&#39;t put a case.
Nice
Lmao! Look at the design!
looks terrible I can&#39;t imagine the fingerprints that would&#39;ve been on this thing
That was really great with the effects on thw robot at the back 👏👏👏
If the cameras were both under screen cameras that were hidden I might
This reminds me of my Note Edge just.. not as great given its edged on both sides
Phone case makers scratching their heads
This concept really didn&#39;t pay off did it?
What’s Apple doing?? They still have notch on there phones
Marques Brownlee....please send me one, u have all these
a problem for phone casing makers
Is it an android?<br>Yes. <br>I’ll pass. Lol
how ican purchase this
It&#39;s just a show piece, no use of that back or wrapped display, waste of R&amp;D
Poor phone case designers
You dont even need a case its just all screen protector
So when you watch porn on this phone, does it show the cameraman on the back side of the phone?
look great!!! But it isn&#39;t useful
Imagine the phone falling down😨😬
18 year old guy: oh sh*t they know im watching the susy Monkey video
How do you set it down without scratching the screen
a
Put things in perspective. You wont take a full pc any where but you will take a laptop. You will take your iphone anywhere but not a fragile wrap around phone.
Wtf is the screen protector
Not sure, I like the experimental approach but I see much value here besides the selfie mode and the cool factor <br>- battery life used for a screen on the back <br>- sensible to impact<br>- no physical buttons to adjust volume in the pocket
Acually you could purchase this in china for around 4200 dollars converted.
We could use the sides of the phone as gaming triggers when playing mobile games, there is so much potential here
The back looks rather unused… so whats the point ?<br>Oh and the charging animation ? The level should tilt with the angle you hold the phone at…
I dont know if anyone noticed or if it was intentional but in the thumbnail he has 69% charged
I see MKBHD is a man of culture as well<br>The thumbnail is very <b>&quot;nice&quot;</b>
I feel like the glass going all the way around the edge is an amazing solution to the crease in foldable phones. It will fold the other way so there is litterally no way to crease it
Never came in market
It&#39;s one of those phones that you&#39;d buy only if you could afford to replace it. Because there is no way you would put a case on that thing that would keep the look of the phone, let alone even work.
How do you do a screen replacement job?😅😅😅😅
whoever thought of the selfie using the main camera is a freakin genius
This phone can&#39;t use cover cuz it&#39;s such a waste aesthetically point of view
Phone case is a joke to you
wtf I want this phone NOW
one word... CASES.
The toy he putting its teleporting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=11">0:11</a>
how the hell do you replace the screen?!
Name of the phone?
What I would be concerned about it would be the safety of the device and the repair bill because its all glass the device looks call but it looks to fragile to use as a every day phone
69???
My mom and dad were finally learning how to hold the phones without giving extra thumb and finger touches on the corners and they came up with this phone where you are practically holding the screen🤦‍♂️
Pls get me one of this,pls
It&#39;s nonsense phone
Imagine dropping the phone me be like😡😡😡🤬🤬😡🤬
One day hopefully Xiaomi would make it as affordable as normal mix
Imagine someone using this phone in public
Hey, you gotta give them the benefit of the doubt, if you designed this phone, and wrote up a spec sheet, would you really pass up the chance to claim over 100% screen-to-body ratio?
How to insert sim cards
It brings back iPhone 5s vibes like circular button
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=79">1:19</a> the beat reminds me of changes by  JCole
I m become crazy 😅😧
I am guessing this turned into the folding phone, but I still think about this device a lot.  Hey xiaomi, I know yall don&#39;t read these but just in case, as an american I am super sus about chinese brands (ironic I know), but if you released this and it worked?  I&#39;d drop my LGV20 in a heartbeat.  Thats lik,e a direct upgrade for me.
It&#39;s nice and beautiful wish dey could bring out d real one
I love this phone
You seriously tried to get it out of the box with apple pencil?
from hype to unknown
I wouldn&#39;t buy it
Background is awesome
The charging animation is just the coolest thing I’ve ever seen on a phone
I need this phone
huawei took this phone and made it foldable
what&#39;s the point of &quot;wrap around&quot; display when you can only look at one side of it at a time Lol it&#39;s just a battery drainer
Where you buy it😲
Omg that&#39;s sooo cool!
The wrap-around is a ridiculous &quot;feature&quot;.........absolutely useless, but expensive .
the charging animation 🤤
if you drop it, its all over
Please help me your 1 click change my life Subscribe my Chanal

This honestly kinda feels like a predecessor to folding phones now. Especially ones like the Z Flip 3, which accomplishes essentially the same things this phone uses the back of the screen for.
Play a high resolution demo video on the phone.
imagine a screen protector for that... also can you use that back
soooo.. u cant put cases in this for protection.. not a good phone for clumsy Hoomans
How the back cover will cover
Horrible
🕶️
блин  подари пж я путина попрошу что бы он на украину не нападал
Good luck making a case

Where the fuck is this phone?
Everyone - <b>Omg Such A Cool Mobile</b><br>Thumbnail - <b>69%</b>
How would video&#39;s look like on that phone?
what if I put a scratch-resistant on this smartphone
<b>drops it</b>
Use cases for the back screen:<br>* Game controls<br>* keyboard (saves a lot of screen while typing)
It&#39;s a waste
Wow🖤
Where did u get it from
looks cool
what a modern m0nk3y wow
y no lo abre? joder me he comido el video para nada
Wow. Love this phone. So futuristic .
Does this phone still exist
Imagine dropping this thing...
unnütz
I think the best part of it is the charge it’s just like a full on night light and like if you’re basically looking at a meme someone or like your family chilling will see it and will enjoy it without you showing them
what for
for me the best part is the selfie, nothing beats a selfie from the rear camera
hay quá chừng luôn
trash
Hay
Nice thumbnail bro
Xiaomi&#39;s animation is so cheap.
Imagine if this one had an Spen 🖊🤔
lol don&#39;t you love the Android &quot;Portal 2&quot; reference in the beginning?
Apple users be like : why do u need this?
I have this phone as xiaomi released this phone on limited sale in india.Its pretty cool phone to have when you are in public as everyone will be staring at your phone but you can only use it as a secondary mobile
looks shitty   , should stoped in the front
2046
Does anyone else think the screen looks like those fake ones they put on demo phones at your local bestbuy?
I juste want to say : WOW
Ааааахахахахах негр
So you cant buy a case💀
Great look wouldn&#39;t want it!
imagin using a hardcase
Wait, bro what about the phone case? 🤣🤣🤣
I don&#39;t see the purpose other than it being more delicate
I need this phone please giveaway it to me😭😭😭😭😭😭
There should be a privacy issues if you use this in public 😂
but we can only watch one side at a moment; what the purpose of this design
Sounds like a DRE beat 😂
This is what Doja Cat meant when she said, wait till you see it from the back back back back back
Sooo how do u play games with that thing??
iphone lovers would love this cuz almost all of them has a flexing disorder
I love this phone but the price is the same than iPhone. So no I won&#39;t buy.
I think it’s good for daily use unless you have suction cups on your hands. It will break in less than a week
The real question is, how do you put on a case?
But can anyone tell me how to put up a back cover or protection for these type of devices
MINDBLOWN!
How can i buy this phone?
NO
iwonder how the screen protector glass looks like dd
TBH. Makes more sense than the foldable rn. And titanium is stronger at the same weight.
The 110% display loses it&#39;s purpose if you put  a phone cover on.<br>lawl
Much better idea then samsung folded phones..may be the future of the mobile phones..
69% Akku sus
Robot Toy displaced within seconds 0.05 to 0.12 Sec...
❤️❤️
Now we need wrapping screen protectors...
who else noticed the 69 battery percentage in the thumbnail?
I know there getting old tech now but I&#39;m still a sucker for a curved screen I have been since the 1st one I owned the galaxy S6 edge . All phones I&#39;ve had since has been another edge or the pixel 6 pro
Its all fun and games till you drop it.<br>(No one will know except official xiaomi stores to fix phones like this)
imagine dropping this
how would you put a case on it? or any kind of protection? and i feel like it would just slip out of my hands
it&#39;s Siaomi not shiaomi
triggered apple
I wish i can buy one 😢😢😢😢
I&#39;ve been thinking of a trnsparent glass phone so i think for that stage we going good, can&#39;t wait to see the release
I&#39;m still rocking a xiaomi mix 3
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men 💕👍🔥
Imagine replacing its broken screen or battery 😭
WOAH, amazing.
damn
Reminds me of the black matter skin in BO3
I can&#39;t believe what I just saw.😮 my eyes are about to explode
The thumbnail is very very very nic
It&#39;s a cool concept.. but why?
Bruh when the illusion broke I felt so disappointed and lied to lmao
Shit i thought it was foldable
Maybe making this a folding concept will make it more practical
That&#39;s so cool but I&#39;d never buy it lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=234">3:54</a> the problem

Imagine dropping it 💀
I think it&#39;s gorgeous. Honestly what&#39;s keeping companies from doing this? We are now in 2022.
I need this phone
Cool but why?
cool<br>i am liam/
Ok but can we talk about how expensive that would be to fix
can you guys make a breakdown of the intro video in you Studio channel?
Fortnight galaxy skin on a phone
How are we suppose to put on a cover in this phone.😂
I think this is stupid. I mean why would you buy something like that. There are some things which needs fixing if those got fixed then i can think of checking it.
This would be a good idea with regular bezels. No need for selfie camera anymore just use the back display and camera
Not the Apple Pencil 💀
Put them to sell copies of the phone
Man, there&#39;s no need of a virtual power button, doesn&#39;t doble tapping the screen makes exactly that?
How much??
Xiaomi: Hey case makers, do you wanna hear a joke?<br>Them: Yes..<br>Xiaomi: <b>Mi Mix Alpha</b>
Problem with MI is Post sales support.<br>My laptop is under warrenty and no physical damege. Its been a month still they have not fixed it.<br>Giving lame reasons as spare part is not available.<br><br>Pls dont buy any of the MI product
Really bro this mobile by mi .... Is the best best best ... Design ... I really lv this ... Thank u very much for showing this mobile... thanks again lv u t.c

Wanna have it but probably very expensive
ayyo quick emergency............where tf do i geta phonecover
Nice thumbnail
I want this in full production someday 🔥
whats the poin? i dont see the use of it
They gave wrap display phone the person who hates edge screens the most! Xiaomi u have dug ur own gave on this one
What is the point
Bros phone is pack-a-punched
Price
Make all round screen, fold screen...... But why not just make a bigger screen n battery??? That&#39;s so stupid...
Why 69 in thumbnail 😂
How are you supposed to put a case on this phone?
Is it for sell I mean are going to sell it. If yes how much. I want
❤️
waiting for mix sigma<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>im so sorry
I’m personally an iPhone guy so won’t ever buy it. But even if I would buy it I think the finger print everywhere would bother me too much lol.
Really cool concept. Needs to be a thing
This phone is going to be a bitch to take apart for repairs
Looks cool but what’s the point of this? It’s just a gimmick….Phones hit their peak a long time ago….They need real innovation.
Good luck trying to send snaps of ur face to girls with that phone
You know you’re rich when you use an Apple Pencil to put aside the paperwork
The robot you kept in shelf disappeared from second row n came appeared in 4 th row 🤔

Looks like a powerbank with that  shape
what if you open an app? how does it look like?
Mark-Ass Brownlee
Good phone
It is for sure weird to look at, but could go to a interesting way
In future its better version will become a normal phone , that&#39;s what always happens in future
Zseni!
if it falls once ur ded
Xiaomi need to give it a rest with the bloatware and adds. If I&#39;ve just bought a phone I shouldn&#39;t be getting adds in the offline music player.
Reminds me of Old Cassett Tape... 😂😍😍😍
The thumbnail tho lol
Hi...is D Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha phone shock resistance?🤷‍♂️
Thank you mark ass brownie very cool
Just like a half of a brick 🧱
Imagine watching nude photos in the train 😆
❗I can understand a Flip Phone hence why I bought one (Flip3) but this is crazy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=123">2:03</a> the bottom is so ugly, it looks like it was rushed, the fit seems kind of loose, the speakers look dirty and the edge of the screen looks chipped ( it may be very dirty, can’t really tell from the point of view ) . The brushed metal effect is too much and the colour of the SIM card plate and the metal bottom doesn’t match.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=226">3:46</a> you can already see display problems, i dont know if these are dead pixels but there’s clearly 2 lines that dont look functional ( oh he just talked about it!)
小米永遠的神
curve screens are dead, got samsung s8 when it came out and impossible to replace at a reasonable price if damaged. Gl getting that screen fixed lol
looks good but not so handy.<br>I mean what the use of the curve and back display  ?
..think.<br><br>What case would help this or take away from this cell
are we not talking about the 69% on the front lmao<br>(sorry if someone already mentioned this, I didn&#39;t read too many comments)
Marques? Do you by any chance.. Uhh still have the phone. I’ll buy it from you….ya know.. to give to jerry.  They cancelled the release. And I just wanna hold it a minute 😅
wheres the headphone jack?
Isnt Xiaomi products banned in the USA
Imagine dropping this bad boy
The battery is disappointing
lmao its a android
Imagine you brake the screen??
Wow this xiaomi phone is really impressive!!! Wow
It’s actually sucks
Nice
In the same time iPhone 13 pro still has a Notch
In the same time iPhone 13 pro still has a Notch
Another useless design !! somehow those companies should learn more about UI. Nowadays we are looking for long battery with better camera. other things are already with enough cutting edge level.
phone case company is typing ......
After seeing the phone<br>*Me be like<br>WTF?..................how to apply tempered glass😱
I just stumbled upon this, I would have brought on, but it looks like it didn&#39;t work out, sad really...  Thanks for the content.
Mobile game devs having a hard time optimizing
Yeeeeaaa no. If my screen cracks the phone is gone. You can&#39;t even use a case. Hella stupid placement even though it is rather tech advanced.
Doja cat will love this cuz if u can see it frm the frnt ...
dropped once, ordered another one.
Break the screen once....<br>...Break the screen once.
China No.1
I afraid watching porn movies in this phone...😅
Tempered glass surely left this chat
Oh well it&#39;s time for a kidney to sell for the screen réparation...
Man this phone will be one of the worst phones for mobile gaming because of the off button.
No not yet but it on my phone
Looks pretty crap

What’s the point of a display that is by definition facing away from you. Stupid gimmick
Soon: I need a screen replacement... my phone has a broken backsite...             A BROKEN WHAT???
the phone is shit, one minute in my pocket and I will need to change the screen, in a word, expensive, unnecessary shit
Don&#39;t drop it.
Curved screens suck, this thing is DOA

Me knowing i can&#39;t have it but still imagining how my mom will react when it falls on the ground
Good luck finding a case for that
Good or not, it&#39;s a spying device.
Am yor bi g fuann plz give me phoe plz
It looks beautiful, but not worth dealing with MIUI again for me. 😅
Xiaomi cancelled this phone production
Everyone is going to kill me cuz its probably not possible but 3D touch on the virtual buttons would probably work good but idk :]
bullshit phone
Whats new to this ? Just a wraparound screen, hard to locate volume lock screen on top no case. I mean jesus christ WHATS SO IMPRESSIVE??!!
i am upset about this phone
disappointed. i want to use BOTH SIDES<br><br>i want to pull the phone out of my pocket and start using it straight away, no matter what orientation it is in my hand.
I have Redmi 10
including built-in hacking system
КАК МОЖНО покупать ублюдский квадрат айфон когда есть такая красота ....
What a stupid idea.
I guess people love iphones because they do not go in that crazy territory.
Thumbnail looks like champagnebrus. A danish ice cream
best phone i ever seen
хуйня
All good till you need to swap out the screen or battery
Tech wise,  it&#39;s great for them to push the boundaries. Functionally, it&#39;s like putting on a rear view mirror on a spaceship.
very cool concept
Oh good, the stupidest and most obstructive feature of modern phones is getting stupider and more obstructive.
До первого падения
i have watched this video before and now i see the battery level in the thumbnail<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>nice
Scheiße
69 &quot;Nice&quot;
reminds me of a cheap dvd-case
I dun need a pop around display. I need a one-hundred dollars device that will be relevant in 10 years, as Nokia. All those shiney crap for a minute keep it for ye self.
Looks like one of them old tape/cassette cases
хрень
Imagine dropping it lol
Imagine dropping the phone and it drops of the side where you have those &quot;DMs&quot; and someone decides &quot;Hey I&#39;ll pick it up for you-&quot;
Stupid people buy stupid things.
오른쪽 저게 왜필요하냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 가격만 비쌀테고 쓰임새는 개똥이것다.
Ahh, Xiaomi... So will it also get updates after a year, that will break the phone?
device for stupid ppl
nice thumbn
This phone makes me nervous. All I can think of is cracked screen. New tempered glass screen protectors will need to be made 😬
mid🥱
So they&#39;ve done nothing to countermeasure the problems I expected before I clicked this video
Not something I would buy but very cool😎
this charging indicator is literally can be seen in any other android phone out there i dont know if he sees it first time or just he didnt find anything else to say about
good luck repairing the screen xD
Am I the only one that noticed the J. Cole Changes instrumental? XD @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=72">1:12</a>
ля негры тоже что-то на ютуб заливюат какие-то видева, просто их обычно со стороны полиция снимает
No thanks .. I am very careless with my things and I may drop that machine and goodbye to the entire screen 😅😅 good video greetings
imo its trash, its wide, heavy, ugly, sharp corners, noone needs to see display on sides or back, it will be 100% expensive, it will crack if its dropped.. imo even other phones nowadays are too big, perfect phone design/size is iphone 7 only if the inside was newer it would be perfect phone, as its size is perfect and its nice clean, practical
almost 2 years later... and where is it?
Looks cool but useless
Challenge:  get a good Case for that. Maybe a Flipcase? Flip, Flap,Flip,Flip, Flap,... :D
Love the thumbnail
Don’t drop it.
How to repair this phone
Why is this black man sounding like a white man.
That thumbnail is Sus
Man how to you protect this
Wow this is somthing I want lol
Iphone be like : for what?? Is it usefull?
The number on the thumbnail.....Voila
Seems like a horrible design imo. Imagine putting a case on. Basically a normal phone but if you shatter the front you have to replace all of it
Drop your phone and everything is cracked
Nice… Atleast someone is still trying to make something innovative/futuristic and not copy the sh**t out of Apple.
And apple still have 4 inch bezels
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTpoj4f25dk&amp;t=57">0:57</a>
its fvcking useless...u cant put them on tabel or any places bcs it would scratch the screen lol
Looks awesome but it adds zero functionality besides selfies, is dangerously fragile, and dang that battery impact is such a waste. Again, looks cool, but it’s a great example of wasteful consumerism.
I&#39;m too practical to buy a phone without a protective case. But there will be those who feel the COOLNESS factor outweighs the cost and risks of dropping the phone. It&#39;s over a year and a half since this aired, is this phone on the market now ?
When will is it in the market? How much?
Terrible design….
<b>I like thumbnail percent (69%)!</b>
i dont see utility or just to empty my battery ^^&quot;
Коток жебей сигилгилечи
Everyone ignoring the thumbnail??? The battery percentage?(nice)
Sad it became nothing
I have seen price 20K RMB, about $3000 at Xiaomi store China. Their foldable costs one third of that. It&#39;s gimmicky device and the price doesn&#39;t make sense considering that only the ful display part of the phone is useful.
Meh. Way too gimmicky.
Good luck finding a case for that... or a wallpaper.
its not SHiaomi, its Ziomi! Like Intel Xeon!<br>your pronunciation is bad
Imagine <br>Using a prototype in public ☺️
In my opinion it’s just a scam apple &amp; the other make same phones different apps &amp; shapes so expensive every year like our life depends on them waist of time and the important is waist of lifetime
Don&#39;t drop it.
why are u black
From technology to practicality, this is by far the coolest result to the dumbest idea ever.
The point being ... ?
Sell it to Apple! ..then we are finally got rid of the nodge.
Weird
FOR YOUR DISLIKE T-SHIRT
Are you concerned about spyware with the Xiaomi or Huawei devices?
We just like it because it&#39;s colorful and shiny. God we&#39;re all so easily manipulated lol 🙄
Chinese product in pandemic? Not a chance
I just don&#39;t want to be political, but it&#39;s about time we should think about technology is not just about the state of the art gizmos.<br>Not ill intended, but we should be pretty aware on our global state of technopolitical conflicts, especially on high tech products, like DJI.<br>Love your channel, Marques!.
The way you removed the foil from the phone should be forbidden.
dust pin review vara
its just design over function
So its basically a phone for people who want to look cool, don&#39;t work for a living and have their parents paying for it.<br>I&#39;ll stick with my Blackview 9800 pro.
Big L from me because it just removes the whole privacy of the user
Apple will copy this soon
no reason for this shit
I wonder what DBrand has got to say about this.
Now put a cover on it
It looks so nice. But all you need is one slip and it is game over.
落としたら終わりだなｗ
yeah good idea dude lets also make books with pages on the back of it so you can read more or whatever
The battery percentage 🤣🤣
This doesn&#39;t even look real... is this real?!
Why not make a phone that fits our hands?
What kinda case would you put on it and what screen protector?
Came for the 69 in the thumbnail
If god of war 4 works on that cp, I will buy it
If god of war 4 works on that cp, I will buy it
im about to puke everytime he uses futuristic for some colory stuff that about the phone that gives you nothing !
Dieter rams would pee on this &quot;design&quot;
ITS SIMPLY INCREDIBLE WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING, A FEW YEARS AGO THIS WOULD BE JUST A FANTASY...

When you drop accidentally your phone.<br><br>Normal phone user : PLEASE NOT ON THE SCREEN.<br><br>Xiami mi user : Oh shit…
Hi<br>Please give me reply
Useless display 😎
Imagine the profits because you can’t use a case and every drop lands on the screen
Why would I need my display to wrap around?
I be too afraid to hold that phone in my hand I’ll be afraid to drop it
Why this isn&#39;t the future of our phone right now since then. Like it came out pretty long ago but here we are at notch no notch phone.
I wouldn&#39;t bother with it
Ok but who needs it you can never see both sides at once anyway + people around you see what youre doing on your phone
Imagine we&#39;re just watching it because we can&#39;t afford it :)
U drop the phone once and it&#39;s over
fuuu black arms in unpackage looks not good
What a time to live in where China is the one commingg up with revolutionary ideas...
but why? no thanks.. my battery does not love a display, that is on, while nobody looks at it
Great the video
The charging % on thumbnail is Nice
Pretty!
drop test plx
why do I see Palestinian flag at thumbnail
xing
Bro .. that droid in your back rack how did it change the place?
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O,M,G
Why?
If this drop... my dear... you&#39;re done.<br>just go back to any samsumg again
I asked my bro why your videos weren’t 2048p and he said your name suggests HD
Forget the phone I want the robot that can apparate Harry Potter style
first android phone i see and actually really want, and it was cancelled 💀
I’d buy a android if there were any with better looking app interfaces. I feel like they all are lackluster and lacking compared to apples clean even look, not to mention the ease of apple phones when it comes to FaceTime, wallet and other much evolved technologies that come stock and ready to link with other iOS users.
My parents keep pressing involuntarily everything in their phones, locking every password, app, and all. Just like they, who has some money because they worked hard, I would never buy a product like that.
I to also use my apple pen to open things.
it looks absolutely stunning! but there is already no profit of having a glass backside on any phone except for fingerprints and the vendor selling you a new phone as fast as possible as the glass is always the first thing breaking! so yeah! great idea... ehmmm yeah... not for me
Video bilglendirdi ama bu kanal sahibi muhtemelen çöp biri
if you drop this phone,<br>no chance <br>instant display damage
Lol at the battery
This is impressive and totaly useless at the same time :D
this looks like futur stuff
Drops phone once screen gets all fucked up
Looks like a powerbank
Am I the only one who thinks it&#39;s ugly?
Look: cool<br>Practicality: zero
Is anybody here?
Imagine now, u need to repair this screen , cuz it felt down or sth haha
CRACKY
I see a lot of people commenting stuff that fits their username and PFP... not sure that fits in a poke ball though but my specific model of poke ball stores data in the cloud!
Its nice but…. WHY?
Drop test plz

I wish I could reach this level ,wish me best of luck
this is wildddddd
Remember when phones were used for phone calls?
Looks like a solution to a problem nobody ever had.
Only me that noticed that the battery is at 69% in the thumbnail?
pontless
Unnecessary back display panel. Tell me the use otherwise. Side portion is okay, but still unnecessary.
Perfect example of form over function.
Bro imagine watching pron with that phone
This is how a lot of the junk phones you find online are going to look in 2030, i guarantee you
G’day mate, your shirt is a little racist.
Nice thumbnail
Did anyone else just click because they saw that the phone was at 69% on the miniature
Looks like a skateboard on ice, and glass breaks.
Screen protector and cover companies already looking for a new job 😂
как буд-то в жопе поковырялся перед тем как в руки брать телефон
click bait🤗🤗
dont drop it!
never buy tech gears made by chinese companies
A phone more unuseless that smart...Maybe Hollywood will know how to enhance it.
Lmfao the thumbnnail
Imagine watching porn and the video appears on the back
No reason to exist
Kind of seems just unpractical and useless lol. Like the battery percentage and time on the side just seem more of a hassle to flip ur phone to see battery. Also more fragile, back screen will get nasty after use. Also all of the features of the back screen are rly all anecdotal and will barely ever het used rly
These days the Chinese are just ahead.
More screen space means more battery usage too..
What about the video calls. Instead of large screen you need to flip your mobile on back small screen to use selfie camera for call.
this is the only phone I want to buy over $1000
Cool tech demo. But super impractical. I can&#39;t function without an OtterBox case on my phone.
Imagine getting the glass replaced! lol<br>Don&#39;t be careless with your phone.
omg look at how thin the besle is oh wait what besle
A great concept until a week later when it&#39;s full of hair lines scratches...
so what kind of case do you use....an invisible one?  what a piece of look at me garbage. ide scratch it in two days
In my opinion there is no point.<br>Better selfies ok but what if I am in a video call and want to use the phone at the same time <br>Yeah, impressive but even less interesting than regular phones.
Just another screen to break 😪
Wow, an “electromagnetic speaker”! 🙃
What is it good for? <br>Ehhm it looks cool and it looks cool and you can acces your widgets slower.<br>Nice , I ll take 2.
Neat surround screen... until you put the case on it... plus, looking cool doesn&#39;t make it useful.
But will it blend? That is the question.
It&#39;s really cool but.... Humans can only see in 2D so I won&#39;t be looking at both sides of the phone at once. Not only that many people use covers and stuff for protection which would cover it? Not only that but it makes the phone extra visible for the millions of people who like to text and drive like the blanks they are, specifically at night.  Just some issues I thought of. This phone isn&#39;t practical at all. I hope they&#39;re intelligent enough to realize this isn&#39;t a good idea.
Cool... and pointless.
chinese company = government in your phone
No one talking about the 69%.
nobody needs this phone.
i would need a case
Well these phones won&#39;t survive much.. Because they will not be that much useful and practical it&#39;s just luxury and stylish
je n&#39;imagine pas la consommation de la batterie ! c&#39;est inutile, donc indispensable ! XD
What if it had physical buttons in the camera strip, would that make it easier to control the volume or lock/unlock the phone??
Display is the biggest battery hog of the phone. Now imagine your battery life used to display something on a screen you&#39;re not going to look at.
no one else seems to have noticed so I’ll say it first: <br><br><b>nice</b>
My 3 reasons not to buy it:<br>this is so ugly.<br>And i don&#39;t care much about the feel, i look for performance.<br> + Don&#39;t want someone to look into my phone and apps from behind.
