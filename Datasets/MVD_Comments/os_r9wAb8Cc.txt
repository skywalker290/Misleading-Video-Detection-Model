I love Terraria
It’s a spider cabin
Mateus 10: 38, 39. Quem não toma a sua cruz, e não segue após mim, não é digno de mim.  Quem achar a sua vida perdê-la-á; e quem perder a sua vida, por amor de mim, achá-la-á.  Jesus está falando nessa palavra que aqueles que preferem as coisas do mundo, o pecado, as diversões e rejeitam a ele, não é dígno dele. Tomar a cruz e seguir a Jesus significa crucificar a sí próprio para as coisas mundanas. As pessoas ao contrário estão querendo achar as suas vidas neste mundo, não querem perder as suas vidas para segui-lo, não querem perder as diversões, os prazeres pecaminosos, a luxúria, a fama, etc, etc.  Muitos pensam que podem viver um pouco mais, quando estiverem velhos, aceitam a Jesus.  A gente passa para o outro lado quando se menos espera, muitas vezes não dá tempo de fazer isso. Você estará perdido e em tormentos depois. Não demore, ele lhe chama. Abraços!
I love Terraria

I don’t know why, but I love watching people play terraria for the first time, and just watching them be surprised about things that I already know, makes me so nostalgic for my first play through
The second I saw the suspicous looking eye I knew this idiot was gonna die
Pewdiepie please make more videos about your ideas and more terraria with funny stuff.
Anyone watching this video they cannot say &#39;this is mincraft 2D&#39;

This, however, is not very effective as if you wish to frequently revisit The Underworld; it may take 5-10 minutes traversing the caves to reach the Underworld.
y do u keep saying bad words!?
&quot;No conners are allowed to enter this tower will be forced to use self-defense!? &quot;&#39; those are NPC&#39;S! they need a house! are u kidding me!?

Felix:Suffer! Because you&#39;re ugly.<br>Felix&#39;es fbi agent:aight we got the racist.

I am equally entertained and enraged by his noobness. Also, the IKEA Hotel is going to be in the way of his skyway(rhymes with highway but in the sky). Also, will he ever learn hoiks.
Pewedipie fall: bcrcbcrbcrbcrbcrbcrbcrbcrbcr<br><br>Me:😐 ok…

Why do spiders sound like Yoshi when they die?
Pewds Jokingly : I&#39;m Gonna Dig Straight To Hell<br>Me : <b>So Who&#39;s Gonna Tell Him?</b>
Damn PewdiePie loved this game enough to make a whole 6 episodes before giving up.  That&#39;s almost as good as Subnautica.
Pewdiepie: &quot;Sugoiiii&quot;<br>Me who understands: ahh I see
Lets be honest we liked the thumbnail 😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os_r9wAb8Cc&amp;t=81">1:21</a> jackseptic eye
The is a faster way to go to hell, just frick someone off then get run over and if you do that after your born you’d go right down under<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Or be born in Florida...
This game kind of reminds me of the old NES game: A Boy and his Blob.
I love terraria

Ho is from 2021
lol
quick story. these video&#39;s inspired me to find my old steam account (which had terraria on it).<br><br>basically, i wanted to play the game because i heard about it&#39;s final update, and remembered about how i used to have it on my dad&#39;s old computer. i asked him if i could go on the old computer, but he told me it&#39;s been dead for a few years. <br><br>i ended up having to get him to tell me the security codes and what not for when you forget an old account and it&#39;s password. it took a while but eventually...i logged into my old account. <br><br>being back on the account was just giving off great vibes by itself. i&#39;ve now installed and started a new world on terraria, and will forever love the game.
&quot;WhAt Is ThAt<br>ded&quot;
YOU MADE ME DOWNLOAD THE GAME<br>edit:I liked it
Binod
Lol he gets so pissed when he dies!🤣🤣

I have two words for you Felix, fearless and funny that&#39;s you. I love watching you play this as I enjoy playing Terraria too. As for me, there&#39;s no fearless anything it&#39;s more overly cautious and easily freaked out...although I do have mad building and decorating skills LOL.
