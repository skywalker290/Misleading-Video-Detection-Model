I remember seeing this in theaters with my mom and she immediately covered my eyes, not wanting me to be traumatized. 🤣
looks like a natural day to me
I SMELL 2008
I can see there&#39;s alot of debating about ants and I have another question.  Wouldn&#39;t hydroclouric acid in human stomach harm  at least some of them?

What is the movie called?😮
This scene hits a little too close too certain ants in Africa. I nearly lost my little brother to them.
Movie name
Ants:the first human😏
I watch that ever day like march .12 2007
2024 like?
wasnt there a movie with GIANT ants in like the 80s/90s?! im pretty sure
Why couldn’t the dude just get up when the ants were pulling him
This was how Ant-Man was born
Worst part is I think these ants are real
because of this i couldnt put me feet on the ground bc of phobia
This scene gives me so much agony, just imagine you are feeling good and out of nowhere the ants enter your mouth, your nose and take you to the anthill. 😅
The only thing i missed from dial of destiny is a brutal fight like this against klaber or hawke with a gruesome death near the end of the movie. At least there is the short but cool fight against colonel weber in the prologue
Слава ссср
This set piece was actually repurposed from Last Crusade. If I remember correctly, they nixed it then because...yeah, I don&#39;t know how you could&#39;ve done it in the 80&#39;s.

New fear has unlock
As per researchers there are 20 quadrillion ants in the whole World or could more than that, more than the weight of the all humans beings on earth. Estimated 250 millions ants for each person. Ants are not smarter than compared to human beings but as per researchers says millions of billions of ants come to their and attached with each other and creates a Super brain phenomena, for example if you see in this video, that women who is hanging to the tree Ants trying to reach her all together thats only super brain can think such thing. Imagine if all the ants on the earth decided to attack Humans on earth than it will be situation like Gog and magog can occurs

Ford still looked SO good in this movie. It´s a shame he looks actually quite old in the latest Indy film. It´s striking to see the difference between the two.

name of the movie please
my kid watched this scene,and he did not get traumatized,but gaged when the ants got into the man&#39;s mouth.
Why the ants just passin by indiana jones
I was unfortunate enough to see a video in which an army of ants kill and take apart a crab...<br><br>I believe some insanity like this could happen.
Harrison Ford was only about 64 or so here hadn&#39;t changed at all really. I look back now and realize how GOOD this one was compared to the new one. He just looked way to different, didn&#39;t act the same, terrible story, and no Steven Spielberg!! So it was an instant turn off for me, also they tried to hard. Made this one look like Raiders by comparison.

Sometimes i am asking myself... <br>Why Spielberg always made these kinds of scene?<br>-In first Indiana Jones was that melting scene, or plane propeller and those skeletons inside of that tomb.<br>-In second Indiana Jones it was that secret path full of insects (that was real actually, not probs) and of course that heart scene with lava.. and last that mining grinder.<br>-In third Indiana Jones, it was that trap decapitation scene, and yeah wrong holy grail.<br>-And in Indiana Jones 4, it was this scene with ants, and Spalko aliens knowledge scene. <br>Now when i watch it again.. I am telling in my head, please Indy take your revolver and make them to not suffer these horrifying deaths.<br>Sometimes it feels like that he doesn&#39;t want to even make this movie for kids.<br>But still its my most favourite movie saga.
Why the duck does this have nearly 300 million views

Whats crazy is ordinary ants will actually do this if they&#39;re starved and have no other food supply.

Crazy to think that this is PG-13 but Indy mercy-killing the dude to save him the agony of being devoured by ants would&#39;ve pushed it to an R-rating.

Bros got a free ant buffet
Producers: “How unrealistic do you want this scene to be?” <br>Director: “Yes.”
Indonesians: Looks like an average day for me.<br>Because.. 5 minutes after waking up i see millions of ants marching down my garden, imagine if one of them hold a flag
This is what was missing in Dial of Destiny: the powerhouse goon suffering a brutal death.

Saifu ants also known as driver ants come from Africa not Brazil also yes they do go in humans to suffocate the victims but no way they can take a full grown human to a nest

And <i>that</i> is the ant of him.
I don&#39;t love this movie, as a whole, but I love this scene.  First, it&#39;s a breath of fresh air to have a movie fight without all the complicated choreography (which I typically do enjoy).  Here, it&#39;s just two guys punching each other until someone drops.<br>Second, the ants are fantastic.  The CGI is really well done and, as shown by the comments on this video, as effective as the series&#39; previous &quot;creepy crawly&quot; sequences.  The fact that they carry the Russian into the ant hill is so bonkers that I adore it.
i wonder what it feels like to swim in ants

This movie sucked.
childhood trauma
Ridiculous. Too bad Hollyweird sets about ruining the old classic heroes.
Ohio ant be like:
When the Russian soldier was dragged down into the hole of the ant hill, in a clear reference to the sarlaac Pit, the lips of the ant hill should have puckered before letting out a giant farting sound, referring to the Russian soldier being dragged deep into its bowels. It would probably have given this film a more serious tone.

Why were the ants walking around the skull?
This was the worst film I&#39;d seen in a time
ANTS TEAM<br>👇
Because they eat ants from Diabetes
These were the golden days of these type of movies in 2004-2009 era baby
The ants weren&#39;t a terrible idea. But to keep things unique, since insects had already been done, and to capitalize on this taking place in South America, I definitely would&#39;ve gone with piranha. Could&#39;ve had gruesome and characteristically bloody deaths with an easy way to hide whatever would net an R-rating.
Imagine dying to fire ants bro 💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1R4hHq8yr4&amp;t=73">1:13</a> this is where it turned into a loony tunes cartoon with those ants

Bro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1R4hHq8yr4&amp;t=79">1:19</a> that was some juicy ant
The bad guy getting killed by those ants was the worst scene I didn&#39;t liked in that movie because it was too nasty.
Bro the ants going in his mouth just like AUGH I don&#39;t know why but like I felt it

Hey
The ants when seeing the two guys fight:ok dont kill them yet there fighting
Deserve😂😂😂😂
Honestly I can see why people didn’t like this movie. Not just because of the story but this scene in particular just looked… fake. The lighting looked very off, like they were mixing the classic action style with modern cgi and it just looks weird. The surroundings look unnatural too. But at the end of the day, an Indiana Jones movie will never be not entertaining, at least to me
That would suck

That was a bad picnic.
Everything here is pretty inaccurate cuz ants or bugs won&#39;t crawl on you, only if they gain your trust. If they are intimidated by your presence then they will crawl on you if they are dangerous bugs, if they are regular ants or something like that then they will run away
This guy getting killed and eating by giant ants and beetles is sad and not hilarious

Suspension of Disbelief remains in this scene, it is not possible that some 2,000 ants are capable of lifting a human weight, more specifically, about 85 kg
Jones was like “bro my bad I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone.” 😂
How many ants are here
I don&#39;t understand there are millions of giant ant&#39;s and this guys are fighting what the hell is going on I&#39;ll be like keep the skull who cares 😂😂😂
just so everyone knows, he was screaming “help” in russian
is this species of ants realy exist ?
I watched some movies with these kinda ants as a child, terrific tbh
interesting I saw this first when I was 10 and it did not scare or frighten me. I thought it was sick, yes, but I did not find it scary or disturbing

Hello my is öykü ho war you l dont
The part that hurts is that one big ant can hurt alot
While ants could certainly strip a human corpse within a few hours, there&#39;s no way that any amount of them could overpower a human and physically drag them.
i remember watching this clip when i was 5 now i am 12 lol
He was hungee
Cool one
silly lil insects!!! being the freaks they naturally are!!!!!
🥹😔😭🙏🏻😱😭
You can kill one hundred ants but you can&#39;t kill one billion ants.
Ants are indeed terrifying, bullet ants, fire ants and siafu ants are examples
Well he’s def not gonna be in Indiana Jones 5
Would have been much more effective if the movie director had directed the villain actor to stop screaming and starting coughing. Really send home the idea that ants were choking up his airway. Instead, we just see ants going in, and he keeps yelling like he has no obstruction. Destroys any sense of congruity. Makes it hard to imagine those ants could be anything other than CGI. But if he switched from screaming to coughing, as though he had just gotten some water into his lungs or something, that would really sell the visuals of screen a lot better, I think.
Indiana always making tricks. They say he is brave, but looks like a coward.

Wow, glad I stopped watching these after like the first two. How CGI unrealistic and stupid this is.
The first thing u think is scary are the ants going in his mouth but the thing is that if ur at the brink of dying the scariest thing is that ur gonna die and not that the ants are going in ur mouth.
Ready?  Fight!
Did he dieded??
How come the camera man is safe from the ants i wanna be safe from ants too😭😭😭

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1R4hHq8yr4&amp;t=120">2:00</a> gross
It’s amazing how terrible this movie looks. The cgi and the actual people never look like they occupy the same space and there is waaay to much light. Just feels like it’s a lit set with a green screen. Look how many times the sun changes where it’s coming from.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1R4hHq8yr4&amp;t=116">1:56</a> I got cold shivers. And then I went On the floor to look at it. Cuz I was on sofa and I thought that all those ants are on the sofa.
And Indy has this face like &quot;sorry, not sorry&quot;.
Wa
I watched this as a child am 9 i watched this at 6 or 7 rn i was at my cringe phase 6 months ago and i love it
Knowing that this would never happen in real life makes it Indiana Jones worthy

Loved that scene as a kid. I would throw punches on the Air imitating indy&#39;s goofy fighting skills.

Why didn’t she keep RUNNING!!!! Why would you climb a tree!!!!!????
When I saw this I woke up and was asking &quot;was that a dream?&quot; Sooo Ig it isnt
If i see those im gonna really drop a nuke on that
I had this movie on DVD as a child and whenever this scene came on I thought the ants would burst out of the DVD player and attack my family. I always asked my parents to skip this scene.

It&#39;s a totally terrifying scene and a scary concept, of course, but the whole execution is way too catholic, it reminds me of Looney Tunes.
it scares me how he is carried into the whole
I wonder what that guy say as he entered the ant mound…that’s what I think is the really scary part
South America have the biggest ants in the world. They should have brought a flamethrower

New fear unlocked.
Jesus Christ died for all of our sins. He died the death we all deserved. He was the perfect one who never sinned once, but he loved us so much he decided to die for us so our sins would be paid for and we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven before God the Father blamelessly. He is the living son of God who wants to know us and have a personal relationship with us. No matter  what you have done no matter how far gone you think you are Jesus can and will save you. All you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior. Believe that he died on the cross for your sins and had a bodily resurrection 3 days later. We cannot be saved by our works but by faith in Christ alone. Repent and turn to Christ. You will have joy, happiness, love, and peace beyond understanding.
What’s he saying as he’s being dragged away
Gigachad ants
is vari scari
Disgusting
Liam Neeson is a great actor for Indiana Jones.
Difference between old movies and this one: the actors didn&#39;t look like they were flailing around in front of a green screen. You don&#39;t need massive cgi, just simple practical effects and stories that were never captured on film before.

I saw this first when I was 10 and it did not scare or frighten me. I thought it was sick, yes, but I did not find it scary or disturbing. The other kids in my class thought the same about this scene, sick, but not scary or disturbing. Some kids can handle and/or take scenes like this, some can’t. Not all kids are the same.
I literally felt goosebumbs when I first time saw this scene, I just don&#39;t know <br>what kind of hell that guy see inside the nest.
I remember watching this movie with my Dad heh... A long time ago... Now I&#39;ll be watching it alone... Heh
How is he still screaming with all those ants crawling into his mouth?
Even if the guy is a bad person, it&#39;s a pity

Ants are really harmless, but when they are together they are deadly. I love Indian Jones. This clip is dead scary for people with Myrmecophobia (fear of ants).
I typed in &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull best scene&quot; and this showed up. Have to agree this is the best scene of the movie. It&#39;s the moment I remembered the most.

Saw this scene as a kid and it gave me a full blown phobia of ants. I needed therapy when I got older and everything. Obviously phobias are complex and there was other stuff going on but this scene was definitely the begining of it. Over ten years later and I came back to see how I would cope- saw the thumbnail, and immediately freaked out. Not ready to face this yet but figured I&#39;d leave a comment so that if I ever do finally get up the courage to watch it again I can see it and hopefully feel a little bit proud. Amazing scene, ruined my life lol

this is why I don&#39;t like ants

I remember my dad taking me to see this when I was 6 years old. This scene scarred me for life
I didn&#39;t even know this was from Indiana Jones!

I know people hate this movie but this was a cool action sequence plus it wouldn’t be Indiana Jones without an over the top villain death scene.
This haunted me for years.
What he should be find
Finally found my childhood memories i like this movie 🍿
A deadly ant swarm is scary enough on its own, but like everything else in this movie, they just had to take it a notch too far into silliness.
&quot;Ok that&#39;s enough internet for the day.&quot;
I got scared, and the worms got into his body and mouth

I was such a big fan of Indiana jones as a kid, I was ecstatic that I was going to be able to see a new one in my time.

There were good moments in this movie.  The Area 51 chase, reuniting with Karen Allen.  But overall it was a mess.  The terrible cgi, stupid scenes like swinging through the jungle, over the waterfall, nuclear refrigerator scene, really messed things up imo.
For a moment there I thought Vladimir Gluten was going to kill Indy.

Not possible.

This just shows our nature can easily overpowers us, mother nature doesn&#39;t need any animals, they just need Giant red ants.

As much as I want to say Indiana Jones 4 doesn&#39;t exist, well directed scenes like this combined with nostalgia value tend to prove me wrong.
That scene had our skincrawled.

What is the name of this movie
The real life version of these ants, driver ants, aren&#39;t anywhere close to this. First of all their nomadic, so they wouldn&#39;t have big underground nests. They&#39;re a lot smaller and look nothing like these. Still really impressive though
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1R4hHq8yr4&amp;t=40">0:40</a> they fighting but THERES SO MANY ANTS
More Deaths Spiders killed mans like?
Who created Adam, the first of the offspring, and who provided you with money and health, and who created you out of nothing, and who answers the sad and distressed if he calls him.. and he is the one who knows the date of your death and who has kept your heartbeat until now so that you know and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth and enter Islam. Why is this poor and this rich? Have you ever wondered why this one died when he was young and this one when he was old, and what is found in the grave and the resurrection…..or do you think that you were created in vain,.. the world is a test house and work in order to be rewarded for what you did on the Day of Resurrection?

I would like to thank this movie for scarring me as a child for life.
Being eaten from the inside out by big dam ants is kinda terrifying
Ahhhhh, nothing beats an ample dose of revisited childhood trauma
I am always itchy when watching this scene
I hate ants. I love to light them on fire and watch them burn slowly 😈 they deserve it.
POW!!!
WHAT?! Is this giant ants?
😨😧😱
I enjoyed this film but there were some really questionable scenes that I wonder if it was George Lucas’ writing or Steven’s direction that’s at fault more as the swinging scene was just ridiculous looking but I’m sure it could have been executed better had it not looked so fake and uncanny.
The spider scene from the Mist was also creepy af

Ah yes, the traumatizing scene that gave me nightmares at the age of 5 and Entomophobia/fear of insects (specifically ants). It’s been 7 years now and to this day I’m still deathly scared of ants 🥳 “yay”
Reminds me of the even more horrifying scene in Walking With Beasts.
