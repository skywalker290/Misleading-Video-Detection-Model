I think people should shutup about bb&#39;s parents rip and all that<br><br>I mean it is really good that people care but I personally think that whenever BB is seeing the comment box he should not be seeing his bad moments of life under discussion rather the good ones he showed us rather the good stuff which motivate him<br><br><br><br>ONCE AGAIN I AM NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMENTING THIS ARE HURTING HIM OR ARE SOME KIND OF IDIOT

This is only the third video of yours that I&#39;m watching, I was fortunate enough to have chanced upon your channel thanks to Dhindora Trailer Ad. I know now about the unfortunate events which had occurred a few months back. I just want you to know that with an army of fans who follow you, you&#39;ll never be alone. And today you&#39;ve gained a lifelong follower in me ( not that it matters). Keep laughing and making us laugh in the process.

None can vlog better than bb. None shall vlog better than Bb🔥
BB❤️
Imagining bb returning to home and no one is at the door waiting for him.....no happy looks...no looks of relief after seeing him return.....those precious emotions are lost in paradise....he just walks in switches on the lights and goes back to bed with a burden of loneliness and despair.....Its not just him....so many people lost someone dear in this pandemic....so many broken hearts and hopelessness.....I hope this ends someday and no more tragedies are to be seen in any person&#39;s life......🙏
How his mom got shocked seeing him an the door.❤️❤️🥺🥺
Noone<br>Me:why he didn&#39;t take samir and bencho with him😅✌
BB&#39;s vlogs are the best
Others vlog : just vlog.            But <br>BB&#39;s vlog.   : Entertainment, Emotion, Explaination,  Love ❤️ etc. <br>That&#39;s why all India love BB ❣️🙏

Almost 90% people are saying to make a character of sameer&#39;s grandfather.. But in episode &#39;Group Study&#39;... Sameer said his grandfather was at that time when there was &#39;Simon go back&#39; and it happened nearly 100 years ago&#39;... So how a man can live 100 years? <br>Who else agrees?????????

Baba was so cool 🙂
Always give importance to your parents because you are the luckiest person on earth if your parents are alive! You want them to come back just for once after your parents die so be humble and polite with them if they are with you.
He&#39;s amazing yr
Bhuvan bahi will be really missing his parents
Hope you feel better soon
Bb rip missing you parents
