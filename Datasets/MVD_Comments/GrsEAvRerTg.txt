How Time Passed <br>And. Argentina 🇦🇷 Did the Impossible ! <br>Messi played his Ultimate Game !
That was not a penalty 😢
Who is here after Pogba got banned for 4 years from Football 😢<br>We Pogba fans know how Legendary he could&#39;ve become.<br>But injuries and other issues Ruined his whole career 😭
I remember when I was watching the final when I was 6 years old I was so happy with Mbappe&#39;s goal
Θυμάμαι όταν έβλεπα τον τελικό που ήμουνα 6 χρόνον ποσό είχα χάρη με το γκολ του mbappe
That should’t be penalnty
That 2018 Croatia team was something man😢
CRİSTİANO RONALDO DOS SANTOS AVEİRO İS THE G.O.A.T
Thanks Croatia for this match.
eh piochey Pogba Pogba ; miss him every phucking day 🥺🥺
COMMON FRANCE W
Fifa world cup russia actually france won the game after 4-2  the movie or show starts after then
The start of VAR moments before disaster
How the time flies so fast😢5 years passed and so on.... <br>I was only 14 on that time and I was read in class 8 in 2018.<br>I was a JSC exam candidate on that time. 🇧🇩🇧🇩❤️❤️
Despite seeing an intense final of 2022, I am now feeling nostalgic for 2018 final. Now I realised how that time running behind so fast. That time of 2018,I was reading in class 8 and also a JSC exam candidate.😢
That take the L dance was personal
With 2022 passed, I forget 2018 World Cup existed 🤷🏽‍♂️
Kylain Mbappe brilliant goal
Paul Pogba brilliant goal
Peresic has screamed that in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=72">1:12</a> <br>Look at the how the goalkeeper reacts, no hate but professional goalkeepers shouldn’t be reacting that slow in a World Cup final, it’s as if he saw it but conceded that he wouldn’t be able to stop it
France ❤⚽🇫🇷
Come On Sports Football Bangladesh National Team !
Is anyone here in 2024 ?

I am fan of Germany but I have a big admiration and respect for France’s football. <br>France is the country that produces the most world class players (togheter with Brazil)
Je suis très content qu&#39;on a colonisé beaucoup de pays en Afrique car sans les joueurs noires on est rien.<br>Au lieu de &quot;les blues&quot; notre nouveau nom sera &quot;les Afriqains en maillot blues&quot;
This final was brilliant!!!
Pogba is exceptionel he is the reason they won the world cup bravo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=48">0:48</a> What does he mean, &quot;what a call ot have to make&quot; ? The rules are simple : hand = penalty , what&#39;s so hard about that ?

Only the complete national team of Argentina is more disgusting than Griezmann! This is not a penalty today. Africa is undeservedly first.

Didn’t Pogba score the winning goal?
I watched this match with my dad, we were cheering for France and we won, now his gone.  RIP Papa. 🙏🏾 😢
🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
What i found out after 1998, 2018 &amp; 2022 is that france is the new brazil &amp; croatia is the new holland
One of the most boring finals ever and 4 years later we have THE most iconic final in history
Dalic should have dropped Subasic for Kalinic.
Croatia were robbed!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=61">1:01</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was pogba at his prime his peak his best miss it and forever will 😢
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>
2023 here
Everyone was for Croatia honestly
Boring wc final ever
Mbappe goal gave me goosebumps
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=81">1:21</a>
I will win a World Cup 🔜 👏🏻
Trophy celebrations in the rain are so much better
who will watch this in 2023😅
Gotta be honest. This was one of the deadest World Cups of all time
Lloris 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Peter drury what a commentator
5 years ago from this historic moment..
I’ll never forget this night. My husband and I were in Madrid for MADCool and bar hopping; it was live in every bar and there were Frenchies everywhere celebrating with their Spanish comrades. Quite an amazing time to be alive 🎉
Imagine if Croatia won the 2018 World Cup!
Was that lahm!? Next to the World Cup!?
France 🇫🇷 was the best  final world cup 2022 also and they was deserved the title by winning again
France are mostly African descent
This is france
One of the worst final i have ever seen. It was one sided match.
프랑스 라인업 쩐다😮
Both Paul Pogba&#39;s left and right foot is fire..🔥🔥
Is this france for sure? All i can see are some players from africa
I remember the last few minutes of the game, my hearth was beating unbelivebly hard but i was praying for my country to win and score than 2 goals but i know the match was decieded by the refree but still, that moment was really intense and sad after Croatia lost
Cristiano Ronaldo 🐐🔥
Best match ever 🤩
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=71">1:11</a><br>No one: <br>Nobody: <br>Absolutely nobody: <br>Seriously…nobody: <br>Peter Drury: Pogba…POGBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He is the best commenttator all around the world
Some say Croatia has small population… Uruguay has less than Croatia and has 2 world cups 🏆🏆 Croatia can celebrate the 2nd place 😂😂😂 1st is all and 2nd is nothing….
Africa All stars team wins the game
Aaaahhhhhhh France gets Penalties in every WC final they play
I was speechless. France celebrated winning the WC like Man City winning the UCL. Shame on them.
GRIEZMANN TAKE THE L😂
Africa 2.0 playing really well
Messi, Messi, Messi. This is old and no one should care. Messi one Qatar 2022 World Cup against France. The 2018 World Cup was one step below 2022 World Cup.<br>Argentina v France for the final (France won the previous final), and Croatia grabbed third place (2nd place here). Argentina was eliminated by France in the round of 16 in 2018, and World Champions in 2022.<br>If you say that France has been in more finals, you are ignoring Copa America finals because that is Argentina.
THE FIRST TEENAGE WORLD CUP FINAL GOAL SINCE PELEEEEEEEEEE HIMSELF
What was France doing to there mangener
2023 ?
Absolutely deserved L for croatia
I love Mbappe with PSG
Game Rating 7.5/10
Most Boring final ever.
Croatias keeper was so bad…
where is kante
👏
As a Spanish I prefer wins France I love Croatia 🇭🇷 but i prefer France 🇲🇫
Who&#39;s here after world cup 2022
No way Griezmann did the &quot;take the L&quot; celebration in front of Croatians 💀

“And Mbappe!!! The first teenage mutant ninja turtle to score in the World Cup final!!!”
Who is here after the WC 2022 FINAL:
2018년 월드컵의 결승전이었던 프랑스와 크로아티아의 경기 정말 인상깊게 시청했었습니다. 오늘 이 영상으로 경기 하이라이트를 다시한번 보니 추억여행을 하는것 같네요. 프랑스, 크로아티아 선수들 수고하셨습니다!
I remember my dad doing the Fortnite celebrate at me after griezman scored
France didn’t deserve the World Cup. They only beat Argentina in the round of 16 4-3 whilst Croatia beat them 3-0
yo
Pogba ....pogbaaaa..............
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=70">1:10</a> what is Modric doing here😂🤣
2018 two team defeated Argentina,2022 Argentina defeated both.. France &amp; croatia
Theft of the century
Gotta love that lucky &quot;penalty shot&quot; I stopped watching at that point tbh
U want this or that
Im so hungry for maine
Maije or seattle. Cena and undeterdakter
they&#39;ll be back
I was rooting for Croatia but had an uneasy feeling from the start about this. France were clearly better, more power and more skill.

who&#39;s the commentator
LA FRANCE A REMPORTE LA COUPE DU MONDE !
Respect for griezman. 📉📉📉📉📉📉
Seeing this rn in 2023, I felt like this was France vs the World<br><br>The same can be also considered for the 2022 final except being France and Portugal vs the World
One of the most beautiful World Cups in the history of soccer , counting everything ( logos , presentations , stadiums ...)
Congrats france for your first world cup
Africa not France
France 🇫🇷 2018 were special 🙌<br>Mbappé At 19 was a goat 🐐 it took Messi till age 34 to win it
I was so cheering for Croatia that day but unfortunately this France team was so strong and they took care of my primary favorite in Round of 16 and then my 2nd favorite in this final the moment i saw the Mandzukic own goal i knew France was gonna take the cup home
This the only final of wc i don&#39;t really like 😇
They win 4-2.then they lose 4-2 against argentina
Why is noone talking about loris&#39;s goal keeping

Mpabbe and Haaland will be an even greater era then Ronaldo and Messi but they were great to watch to when they played in Spain.
Much better world cup then 2022 😢 hope we see fotball party coming back in 2026 in USA ❤️

From today i hate perisic
Allons France !!!<br>Nous sommes les champions!!!!
Peter Drury always making a match look like a movie, absolute legend
The one and only reason I don&#39;t like mbappe, he made me cry back in 2018
Mbappe was an animal since the start
When a kid winning a world 🌎 cup so why you can,t.🔥
4-2 finals 2018 France wins<br>4-2 finals penalties 2022 Argentina wins
Croatia can beat anyone but france was waaaayy beyond their level. Similar to how Morocco got France to end their dream and Argentina was the one to stop a repeated France vs. Croatia 2022 final
Congratulations africa ❤😅
espetionly Luka Modric
france might best croatia BUT CROATIA IS STILL BETTER!:D
I want croatia to win:(
Best moment
MBAPEE- OH MY WOOOORD
2 minutes<br>Yep that&#39;s pretty much sums it up
&#39;FIFA would never let such a small nation to win the world cup. It was obvious that we were robbed in 2018&#39;<br><br><br>-Mario Mandžukić
La  France est la meilleure 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵👍❤❤❤👍👍👍💝
A Croatian scored a goal for France 🇫🇷

&quot;The first world cup final goal sicne pele himself&quot; That&#39;s how much of a great pele was and mbappe is going to be the best in the world too!
La peor final de la historia
Greizmann:<br><b>runs, stops, emotes</b>
Mbappe🤯🤩
Look at prime france I was rooting for Argentina but still felt bad for France
So in 2018 world cup Russia Belgium gets third but in world cup 2022 Qatar they get grouped that makes no logical sense to me.
Je suis indien et j&#39;étais tellement heureux au moment où j&#39;ai vu la France gagner en 2018. même si mon propre pays ne le joue pas, j&#39;ai un lien très étroit avec la France car j&#39;apprends le français de mon préféré professeur pendant 2 ans, ces journées me manquent.
France coming here to cope now 😂
Many people will come to this video and they did not think that there were controversies but if they watch the entire game then they will see that two goals scored by France were controversial, the first from a non-existent free kick the second from a penalty that the Croatian where the arm was in a natural position and where unfortunately it was a penalty but what most caught the attention of that penalty was that Griezmann (who was caught on camera) tells or wants to tell the Croatian goalkeeper where he should shoot so he can score the second goal, Although later I realized that the Croatian goalkeeper in that final was injured and the question is who lets an injured goalkeeper play in a world final? I ask myself that question to this day because at least 3 of those 4 goals that France scored could at least have been avoided. (For me this final was either agreed or stolen from Croatia).
We not gonna talk about how 7 L Danced Croatia 😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭
pogba him
I think 2018 world cup is best

France💙🤍❤️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=1">00:01</a>
mbappe is so young and winning wc final 😎😎
... if france one 4-2 but argentina scored 4 and france 2, 4-2????
The fact that the second ever teenager to score in a world cup final after Pele and after exactly 60 years is amazing!
Does anyone else not remember this at all? Like this did this even happen
For the ones saying bout the population of croatia , quality &gt; quantity, thank you.
2022 france is second and croatia third, they stick together always LoL
Pogpa,kante,griezmann,giroud and mbappe is the best
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=81">1:21</a> mbappe has now scored a hattrick in the 2022 world cup, what a player he has real potential.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=61">1:01</a> bro just emoted take the L 💀💀💀💀
M BAPPE  is better of with the cup he does every thing for the team and he just gets the golden boot he is the reason why they won  and in the 2022 world cup. They  diden&#39;t win but he got them to the end . he does every thing for the team but gets a boot so you should let him get the cup next time France wins

Worst World Cup Final Ever! 👎👎👎
In the future I&#39;m a France player
Just a reminder that france could’ve won the 2022 word cup aswell, i mean, they reached the final without Benzema, Pogba, Kante, Kimpembe, and a lot of players.
Ref was paid off.
It was the best  world  cup final
Before there was Salt Bae..
Ni el partido ni la ceremonia final fueron tan emocionantes como en 2022. Felicitaciones en el 2018 Francia. Pero la mejor final del mundo de todos los tiempos fue la Qatar 2022.
The champion france
All of France&#39;s 13 goals &amp; assists 🇲🇫<br>Goals:<br>Kylian Mbappé - 4<br>Antoine Griezmann - 4<br>Paul Pogba - 2<br>Raphael Varane - 1<br>Samuel Umtiti - 1<br>Benjamin Pavard - 1<br><br>Assists:<br>Antoine Griezmann - 4<br>Olivier Giroud - 3<br>Theo Hernandez - 2<br>Blaise Matuidi - 1<br>Corentin Tolisso - 1
Cette coupe du monde restera gravée à jamais <br><br>On sait tous où on était à ce moment là et où on la fêter 😄😄
I want France win
France 🇫🇷
Crotia and France Both Beat Argentina 2018 ! <br>And Argentina beat both of the to win The World Cup 2022<br>Thats is Something unbelievable !
Remember Mbappe was 19 at this time...
Netherlands &amp; Croatia are unluckiest teams ! Made it to multiple finals but ended as runners up!
Only a loser celebrates a penalty goal like that

Man really did the L 💀💀💀
Did you Know that France won 2018 world cup against Croatia by 4-2 and lost in 2022 against Argentina by 4-2 In penalty shootout
Argentina lost to both 2018 WC finalists in 2018<br>Argentina beat both 2018 WC finalists in 2022<br>A lot of things change in 4 years, wow
The only regret I have about this French win is that Pogba became a world cup winner.
“THE FIRST TEENAGER TO SCORE A WORLD CUP GOAL SINCE PELE”<br>RIP PELE FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS ❤️ 😢
This is the worst final I&#39;ve ever seen <br>No offence
😂
Noooooooooooooo!
Croatia vs Africa
&quot;He has screamed that in.&quot; What an incredible commentary
2022 final Is the best !!! All drama tension sadness victory found in one game !!!!
Nothing excites than the final between argentina vs france 2022 final !!!
Messi is the GOAT.
French! You got this back in 2022!!! You were tought a lesson in 2006 and in 2008 from Italy, too!!! A loser gang, that&#39;s what the french team is.
Who is in 2023
Aburrida final 😴
2022 final is the best final of all time 🙌🏿
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=70">1:10</a>
France predicted their 2022 penalty score in 2018 😮😮
Rigged ..
I wonder why Paul pogba didn’t play with France this year?
This Time Argentina had the last laugh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=60">1:00</a> bro emoted on croatia 💀
Un título que este año Francia pudo defender pero Messi y compañía Argentina le arrebataron el bicampeonato mundial<br><br>2018 🇫🇷 4 - 2 🇭🇷  🏆  2022 🇦🇷 3(4) - 3(2) 🇫🇷
Why would he tease the crowd… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=62">1:02</a>
Mbappe: we r world champions<br>Messi: no u r no longer ,we r the reigning Champs...the crown is with the GOAT
I&#39;m so glad france lost
France was missing pogba is this 22 world cup.
Even for 2018 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=61">1:01</a> is cringe af
Why were the English commentators in 2018 much more exciting than the boring 2022 ones?
The L got me 😂
This is by far the best commentator
How the heck did Croatia make it to final??
2014 Messi cried, 2022 Messi is laughing all the way to Argentina. Now i can finally say Messi is the Greatest of all time.
El mundial más fácil.
Andddd yeahhhh i found something strange out that France won against Croatia with 4-2  World Cup Russia but when I go back see final result Argentina Vs France World Cup Qatar it&#39;s ended up 4-2 again.coincidence???
Legends watching on 2022
who here after final wc 2022!!
2022 trophy celebration looked more better and royal because of the dark lights
France will win in 2026 mbappe will get another one
My country was Champion of the world!!!🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷

KYLIAN MBAPPÉ SE GANÓ EL RESPETO DE TODO EL MUNDO AUNQUE PERDIO FRANCIA PERO PARA MI KYLIAN MBAPPÉ ES UNA LEYENDA PERO GANARON EL MUNDIAL EN 2018 DEJEN SU LIKE
Congratulations 🎉
Bad Final when you see the Final in 2022
The commentator is super cool I wish he was in 2022 World Cup
How times fllies instead of france griezmann now mbappe takes france every penalty
My guy was doing the &quot;L&quot; dance  at the people.
The scoreboard of Croatia/France and France/Argentina is same but it&#39;s only in the penalty kicks
Mission failed. We’ll get them next time. lol
I hated this match <br>The most boring final in the history of this tournament
Am I the only one who &quot;remembers&quot; that Croatia won in that final?
Croatia came 3rd in 1998 France.<br><br> They then came 2nd in 2018 Russia.<br><br>They now come 3rd in 2022 Qatar.<br><br>Incredible team they have, very proud of their effort and work in these games. I hope they win themselves a gold one day (maybe in 2026?)
Rusia 🇷🇺❤️ 2018 uno de los mejores mundiales que e visto en mi vida 👏👏👏👏
2018: worst WC final of all time<br>2022: best WC final of all time
za mało czarnych mieli
⚽
football is the best sport these world cups truly delivered, Vamos Argentina
Last goal show that poor performance by H.Loris., so 2022 wc  again this type of poor performance by h. Loris!!!😭
2018 france croatia <br>2022 Argentina france
Can we just forget about this World Cup and think how fun we expiernced yesterday 😅😮
Not going to lie this was a boring final and it was expected.
Where was Pogba, Benzema, Kante, Nkunku and more?
can&#39;t believe mbappe only 19 at that time
I came to Watch Mbappe after 2022 WC Final
Here after Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties in the final
Anybody Watching After 2022 Final <br>Please Like here
yea 2022 was more exciting
If this team was facing Argetina well we all know the result will be different!
messiii 2022 😂
Let&#39;s just realise Argentina beat both World Cup 2018 finalists
2022 Final was much better than 2018 Final
Here after mbappe do 4 goals to argentina👑
4-2 argentina vs france
Who&#39;s here after the 2022 world cup
We had our moment of glory but Messi deserved this cup 2022 he wanted it more than anything ♥
кто после финала 2022?
Here to see Mbappe happy face after losing 2022 worldcup against Argentina.
Mbappe has to wait...
Finally, Here after Argentina the legendary Lionel Messi won ,2022 fifa wc final.
POV you&#39;re here after seeing argentina become champions 😁
now mbappe’s smile just gone😢
Croatia are very respectable given they have a population half that of my city
I am so happy the african team from France lost.<br>Diversity is a weakness.
Considering that Brazil won against Italy in 1994 (the year Brazil lost Ayrton Senna), lost to France in 1998 (France was the host) and won against Germany in 2002 (only to get beaten up by Germany 7-1 in 2014), will France make a comeback in 2026?
to think that 1 year before this mbappe would basically be a highschooler is insane.
Qui es là en 2022 🏆🥇🇫🇷
I&#39;m here after Argentina Wins FIFA WORLD CUP
Whos here after they lost
Sorry France. But now it was Messi&#39;s time. ❤️
I came here to relive this moment after France lost today.

i remember this match like it was yesterday omfg 😭 highkey wanted france to win again this year but its ok ig(congo to argentina) 2026 better not disappoint tho🤭(if 2026 is even gonna exist)
France won World Cup in 2018 with 4-2 in regular time.<br>France lose World Cup in 2022 with 4-2 on penalties.
And Now France Lose versus Arentina
Can&#39;t believe mbappe won a FIFA World Cup at only 19!
Back here for Mbappe’s 2018 World Cup finals’ goal.
Who is here after watching 2022 worldcup<br>Argentina - France ❤️👀
I wanted Messi to win his World Cup @ Quatar 2022 , even though as a nation, I supported France so the outcome was fine for me. Really glad it was a competitive match in the end rather than being a walkover for Argentina.
after seeing sad face on mbappe i rewatched this after france loss to argentina in world cup 2022.
Mbappe 2022 🥹💔
Watching this to compensate the lose against Argentina 2022😭
They already won. Let Argentina win now lol.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg">0:00</a> this didn&#39;t happen in Qatar, did it?
Thanks to the referee Argentina has to win twice in 2022 world cup…once in regulation time and once in shoot out

Matt Ryan at it again guess he was like &quot;28-3 in the sb wasn&#39;t enough.....i can top that from 1x time to 2x time record holder&quot;
Amanhã de novo!
Croacia pechos frios
Francia Bicampeón de la mano de Fifaa

ムベッパこの時からあまり成長してないかも？<br>おにぎりでもバロンドール取ってんのに、<br>リーグアンで遊んでる場合じゃないだろ
Don&#39;t worry Croatians, Messi will get them for you
Let go today we are on 2022 France 🇫🇷 the have to repeat the title like before let take that shoot let go FRANCE TO WIN 🏆 THE 3 cup on Qatar
Is it me or does nobody see the &quot;refereeing errors&quot; that favored France, for example the &quot;foul&quot; of the free kick to Griezmann that ended in a goal?<br><br>Something more debatable is the Penalty that they gave to France with the hand of Perisic.
incredible World Cup Final
Super match
Wow, cool football!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=110">1:50</a>
I think france again win 😅😞 thoughts massi dream ?
Let me know how many of you waiting for france vs argentina final ⚡️
フランスは移民の子孫の力で優勝できた
Now France are in the finals again, this time, against Argentina
This wasn&#39;t worth a final😏for me best 2018 match was arg Vs france
that game won&#39;t happen against Argentina, believe me
Time  for France to win it again in 2022
كان كأس العالم هذا مليء بالدماء بسبب ان روسيا كانت تدمر سوريا في هذه الأوقات
Did Benzema play this world Cup?
I&#39;m 19 and Mbappe scored a goal, and won the World Cup at a younger age than I am.  Nuts.
This world cup final is not interesting at all, Croatia made it look very easy for france
I seriously do not understand why it takes FIFA two days to upload highlights of the previous game in the 2022 world cup!
Mbappe, benzama, pogba..... Its their worldcup 2018🙏🏻
goalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Slapped
4 yrs later, France is on the final again &amp; should defeat argentina in the finals
New champions Argentina
France win 2022
2022 World Cup champion is France 🇫🇷 ❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=85">1:25</a> chills since Pele!!
2002<br>14 июл.
No foul free kick given to Griezmann and OG after that,then handball witch these days is not handball and wasn&#39;t then but given like FIFA always gives to those in need !! VAR is brought to this game so they can manipulate easier...
And now we’ve got 2022 and here they are again! France!!❤️
Looks like France is going to be the third to take a back to back win!
Thx russia for World Cup 🇷🇺 I will have 2018 wolrd,cup
France + africa vs croatia
I remember this day it went fast, hoped tye Croatia won that match. Hoping today that Morroco win the match against France or at least win against Croatia in the semi finals cause they really deserve it💯👌🔥🔥(Körkort)...<br><br>Will be updated later in 2026/Jun/8...
THEIFA HELPING MESSI STEAL TROPHIES
France will get it again 2022
Croatia is the most underated team in football history, its insane that they have a population of 4.5 million and can produce one of the best football teams on earth, i got a feeling they winning again in 4 yrs
No way that it could beat France, Better team win the cup on that day<br>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=61">1:01</a> bro hit a fortnite emote 💀💀💀
Who is going to present the trophy at the start of the 2022 World Cup Final? Lahm did here, since he was the 2014 winning captain. If France, as expected, do go through to the final, Lloris would be playing that game and cannot do this trophy presentation.<br>Edit : It turned out to be Iker Casillas in 2022, who also presented the trophy in 2014 final.
Il vont refaire la meme chose cet annee il son chian
La france a acheter ce match
just came back, after Croatia&#39;s loss against argentina
Let&#39;s repeat this again!! please I know the Quatari have a bias  for  argentine  white....  but France has to prove that they  are within that nucleus...   they must  prevail!!    Beat the  moroccans  and then beat  Argentina!!
is the 2022 French squad better than this one? Wondering if they can win Argentina
I hope Mbappe destroys Argentina. Qatar 22 is in favor for midget Messi to win. Every game ref is paid for midget Messi to score BS penalties.
Who is here again in 2022?
This time for Messi,s Argentine 💗
Congrats to this AFRIKAN-FRENCH football team fow win this world cup 2022 in Qatar
Am seeing crotia again to the finals
This time 2022 world cup final will be played by Croatia vs. France and next win see Croatia 1-0 France

Most scandalous match Ive watched in such a big match.
Final world cup 2022 Will replay, between France vs Kroasia , and winner France

History is repeating itself this year,France all the way up.
Africa 2.0 = france
Man f France , anyone but them
This will happen again in 2022 final🤗
Let’s see France vs Croatia again. I can’t wait this match 🎉🎉🎉
Mbappe doesn’t deserve all the fame Antoine did a lot of work so I think he deserves it
This felt like a friendly game lol.
final terkonyol
Usess match ever one sided match
France will win the World Cup again-
That “Here’s Mbapeé, OH MY WORD, The first teenage World Cup final goal” is iconic
You all ready for rematch?
Crazy how it can happen again, but now they have a keeper!
⚽️⚽️🌎🌎🌎🌎⚽️⚽️⚽️🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🏆🏆🏆🥇🥇🥇🇫🇷🇫🇷
Morocco 2022
for the uninitiated, the 1st french goal came from a free kick won by a blatant griezmann dive. moreover, it would have been disallowed under new rules because pogba who challenged mandzukic for the header was offside. the second one came from the penalty that according to the new rules (and old too, but vaguely) is not a punishable handball.
All the best Dominik Livakovic and the Entire Team ❤️💙😍⚽🇭🇷🏆
Mbappe life&#39;s = pele life&#39;s remake live action
Again??🤨🤨🤨
need a repeat of this again 🤭
and we might get the same match up again.
Croatia deserved the World Cup especially since they beat us (England)
Can&#39;t believe 4 years ago this occured. The greatest month of my life. 4 years later, it comes to an end. In a week, this will repeat itself. The planets ultimate game.
Da moš misliti što bi dobili ono Finale da nije krivo dosuđen penal. Do tad smo bili 1:1. Iskreno dali bi im još bar 1 gol do kraja prvog poluvremena. 3 gol od Francuske je  odbijanac. Jedino iskreno naj bolji I&#39;m je gol 4.
Lol imagine it happen again😂
POV:Argentina win the world cup by 1-0
Argentina vs France final.
2018 final moroco verses crotia
Fifa 2022 Will Again......
I watched this and I think there is no fans for France!!! I don&#39;t know why?! May be someone says their blacks they are not French they are blacks... What a racist people  thinking like that!!! In the comment box full of Croatia fans!
Croatia never had a chance in this match and this new French squad is even stronger and dangerous.
Its December 11, 2022 and I believe Croatia vs France could happen again next week. My hope is Croatia will be the winner this time if happen.
All the Mexicans supporting Morocco, let’s go! 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
THIS TIME IT&#39;S FOR MOROCCO 🥰
Rematch in 2022?
Why people saying no african team won a wc? Watch this video

크로아티아 진짜 이때 연장의 연장으로 결승 갔는데 카타르 월드컵에서도 반복 되는거 같다!! 크로아티아 결승 가즈아🔥🔥🔥
Fun fact : You came here because you know it&#39;s going to be the same in 2022
Again and again it&#39;s possible 🤤🙌🏿
Croatia will meet France again in the 2022 world cup final
Imagine Croatia vs France again
4 years later, both teams are one Match away from repeating the 2018 World Cup final.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=61">1:01</a>  💀💀💀💀💀
is this for England to won this year tonight we going send France home for sure
im still here, after 4 years. i have to say not deserved, refree on their side, he made sure france won.
Time flies⏳ We can see it again Croatia vs France...
Suarez, in South Africa 2010 (against Ghana). And Griezmann in Russia 2018... Two miserable beings.<br>🙂<br>France scored their first goal in this match after a shameful dive from Griezmann, a sh!t-head. He deserves no respect whatsoever.
French West Africa Vs Croatia
Jaman sebelum perang Ukraina bergulir dan rusia diboikot dari pildun 2022

As a Brazilian I like coming back to this video to feel better about the loss <br><br>(apparently people don&#39;t know how to take a Joke here 😂)
And now Croatia is again in the semis
Go for it! Croatia
Pogbaa!.. Pogbaaaaa!!!

They are coming again
2022 final rematch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=26">0:26</a> that skills of Ivan Persic are unbelievable. What a world class player.
I’m cheering Croatia all the way!
Still such a bad day for Croatia.Hope they will revange again and Croatia takes the cup home
Croatia will win this time for sure
Looks like rematch 2018 in 2022
Will revenge be possible in this World Cup? :00
Again 🤩 france vs Croatia
Fun fact: France vs Croatia can still happen again
FU hrvatska.
I was rooting for Croatia during this game. It is sad that France won
Allez les blues
Hoping to see this again
The most useless and boring world cup final ever
Who wish coratia should win - so they take avenge 🙂
Football World Cup
FIFA World Cup
mbappppppppppppeeeeee
Hock ngô thắng minh &amp; cố vượt qua tất cả hỉ nộ ái ố cuộc đời &amp; 300 tỷ/năm
M&#39; Bappe is Dangerous like Captain Levi!
2018 world Cup is my favourite.
Incredible how it started to pour down rain when they won too.
I must have skipped that 2018 world cup, and here we are 2022, time flies.
For france and possibly now the world.
France doesn’t even have pogba this World Cup and look unstoppable
VAR ruined the game, pinalty and offside
such a lame final, Croatia was against weak teams and always won in penalties or extra time. It&#39;s just lame, I hope Brasil take them out
Viva la France!
Now I look back at this Cro have a better keeper now
France pay for win<br>Croatia win in our hearts
Boring world cup final
inşallah bu senede görürüz
this dude really did a fortnite dance in a FIFA world cup final
It’s crazy how pogba can shoot with left and right foot
Africa world champion
I feel like penalty should be banned in final
Is it just me or was the Croatia goalkeeper not about it
Very strange that Croatia recived 4 goals on final when they were almost perfect on previous matches&quot; to play for a draw&quot;<br>It looks  like an agreement between ..in which  France will have an easy win ..and France Football will give Ballon d or to capiten of Croatia LM<br><br>The &quot;Final&quot; was enough to celebrate for Croatia
France for 2022
That was a BS &quot;handball&quot; call that I and every Croatian will remember as turning the tide in France&#39;s favor.
&quot;The first teenage world cup final goal since Pele himself&quot; is the greatest achievement any footballer can ever achieve
Who is here this 2022 world cup again those franch guys are on fire again 🔥 I was not expecting this world cup franch to be on fire seems like more likely they will take this world cup again than the whole world cups will be boring franch guys keep collecting
France is in Africa?
The dumbest finall all of the time,,
France is the new Germany 🔥
I hope we win again 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷😭
The free kick by Griezmann on the first goal wasn’t a foul
France were Amazing 2018 😂😂😂<br>I get enough of this game pooogba pooooooogba ...😅😁💯💯💯💯😊
Is this is the french team? I thought this was South Africa
bro did take the L
Poor goalkeeping<br>Though
It&#39;s was the best moment
I am sure croatia and france will be in final again
Bro told the fans to take the L 😂
How half the french team were from the colonies.
Będzie w niedzielę wpierdol 😀
I do feel bad for croatia look at their goal keeper lol
What a match
Who&#39;s here after Tunesia choked France
Croatia goalkeeper didn’t even try on those goals
Was never rooting for either team but watching the ending brought a tear to my eye, the beautiful game will never die
Worst world cup final ever
Oui
I don&#39;t pay close attention to football, but I just realised that Mbappe was 19 when he scored a goal in this world cup final. Goodness gracious 😳

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=58">0:58</a>
Croatia will win 2022 wc
No world cup can&#39;t reach the level of status of Qatar world cup 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seeing Griezmans celebration is jarring lol
Own goals<br>Penalty (handsball) <br>GK Blunders<br>Pitch invader<br>Fortnite dance<br>the funniest final
X: How many times did you watch this<br>Me: Yes
i still remember like it was yesterday especially pogbas goal incredible it was one of the best and memorable days in my life
4 2 is a crazy score for the biggest sporting event each 4 years
Time flies
Peak Griezmann
The most boring final
The stupidest, silliest most boring world cup final
Who&#39;s the commentator ?
I don&#39;t watch football because football is not famous in india i am watching it right now because i had a question in my exam that how many goals in fifa final and i didn&#39;t it wrong 😢
Where&#39;s pogba now?
France 💙💙💙
Viva la France
The job is done
LOBILLOS MUSICAL DE DURANGO.

I was in France at that time 😂 the people where crazy and fired in the air 😂
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
I remember in the last 5 minutes of watching that game live on tv how I just didn’t stop doing the orthodox sign of the cross and very fast, just praying for Croatia to win! Wasn’t happy with France not taking it easy on them, but thinking about it now, I’m very impressed that Croatia made it the grand final!
Planets ultimate game… American laugh
I remember I was in a camping in southern France when France won, it was crazy<br>Congratulations to Croatia from France 🇫🇷🤝🇭🇷
France with only 2 French player kekw
What a blooper of a World Cup this was. Worst one I done ever seen.
I’m still wondering if benzema cried that he didn’t get to play because of a scandal 😅
Croatia should have won :(
France? More like Africa
Griezman itu gabia main bola sumpah percaya ma gua
BELGUIM WAS BETTER
2018 WC&gt;2022 WC
Worst wc final ever. No one knows where Croatia is and how they reached the final. Was the least viewed final ever i didn&#39;t watch it.
africa world champion
Mbappe so underrated at this time
Amazing game, was so much fun live, congratulations France! My picks to win the 2022 World Cup again 🙌
Jesus is King

Who&#39;s here before FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022?
4 Years, 4 Months and 5 Days Later<br>FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022
<b>Today a new World Cup begins after more than four years of waiting, so you have to enjoy it as if it were the last</b><br><b>Let&#39;s enjoy the great goals from the great matches of the great players and this last World Cup with 32 teams</b>
🇷🇸
pov its 2022 and World Cup 2022 just started in Qatar
much respect for CROATIA
Man, it doesn’t feel like it’s been 4yrs but here we are, men &amp; women of culture… it’s on once again - LFG!!!❤🎉
Fixed final
Many didn&#39;t enjoy this game. 6 goals is too many for a Fifa World cup final
Hiii
who’s here before qatar 2022?
This was the worst final out of the past 3. Everyone knew France would win although I wanted it to be close game it wasn&#39;t. Hopefully this world cup has a close, unpredictable final.
Been to Croatia a couple of times. Humble, traditional and honest people. <br><br>And they barely have a right to be where they&#39;ve been as a footballing nation but that goes to show you just how hard working they are. It&#39;s not a coincidence either, the Bobans, Sukers and Srnas of the old days are proof of that.
“A penalty for France in the world cup final”. Thanks, I thought it was the FA Cup final
I&#39;m here before World Cup starts tomorrow
Tomorrow the 2022 World Cup begins 😍
This world cup final was insane, lets hope this one will be insane too
Bro I still can’t believe he fortnite danced in a World Cup final 💀
It doesn’t feel like its a wc final.old final games were felt diffetent ı mean ı remember the final between france and italy back then 2006. That game was feel like most importsnt thing in the world. I hope that this feeling come back in qatar
Tommorow a new world cup tournament starts ⚽
One day for the new World Cup!!!!
So excited for the Qatar World Cup to start 🙌
Legendary commentary
Time flies so fast....it was world cup 18 final ....and tomorrow is fifa world cup 2022 qatar
Essa Copa eu nem vi direito. Ainda tava me recuperando da de 2014. Mas na final, eu preferia a Croácia ganhando uma copa pela primeira vez. Seria mt mais bonito. Sla, França é uma seleção q não dá pra gostar - copa de 98 foi comprada. Falei, tô leve!
Croatia done very well getting to final but i always felt some team wood hammer them England had 4 clear cut chances against them in semi Russia had at least 3 you don&#39;t win a world cup with a weak defense
goal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=61">1:01</a> bro accidentaly pressed the emote button
Semoga terulang kembali timnas Prancis juara lagi tahun ini
The match felt like Croatia were handicapped from minute 60 onwards. Their energy levels disappeared. A shame because had they not been so exhausted we might&#39;ve seen one of the all time toughest finals in the world cup
Huge respect to Croatia but m&#39;y heart is going with France this time😄❤️
2022 Ajmoo Croatia. 🇭🇷💪🏼✌🏼
Crazy how 4 years passed, just like that …
Croatian team 100% Croatians.....France 95% African.
Not as memorable as 2010. But congratulations france
This year, I think france maybe eliminated from the group stage.
for the people who feel like roasting lloris for the mistake. The defender should have just cleared it but instead he passed it to a keeper who was being pressured.<br>I am a fellow GK
The most rigged match in history of fifa
Respect
Griezmann deserves aids for the fortnite dance
Griezmann deserves aids for the fortnite dance
Griezmann deserves aids for the fortnite dance
Some forgotten final
Running midfield by kante and pogba was really scary. But how about the line up of midfield this 2022 WC?  Without including pogba and kante can make a different version of france?
Croatian goalkeeper was bought out
Griezmann will pay for that dive and that celebration when he scored pen
Bro just emoted 💀
Pogba 💪

Feels like just yesterday man!! I remember I didn&#39;t have anyone to leave my kid with that night 😂😂 had to sweet talk my brother to stay with her 😂😂 and so he had to watch the game in the house while i go to a club...had even worn a blue dress and we won 💃🏿💃🏿😂
Balkan pride. Bravo Hrvatska!
We are back
Qatar 🇶🇦 2022 France 🇫🇷
a smile on pogba, makes me smile
GERMANY 2022 🙌🏻
Who is here in 2022! Time gone so fast now it’s FIFA 2022..
Worst match of world cup ever
4سنوات 🤦‍♂️
Why France always won World Cup at Home?????  🤔
I remember going crazy when Croatia equalised it
Looking at this before 2022 wc and tbf he all knew france would win this game but for Croatia to score two goals it exceptional
Pure joy!!!!
Great dive by greizmann
Mostly African players from French team
Love the French ❤
Everytime this commentator speaks he gives me goosebumps 🥶
It&#39;s not Team France it&#39;s Team Africa.
Pogbaa pogbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Time flies 😂😂finally world cup in a month
There are too much dumbpeople who say france team isnt french just because a lot of players are not white. They were born and raised if france. Recieved french education at school and for football. They are french. You just sound jealous. They worked hard and deserved to win because they scored more than croatia. That’s all
Bunch of frauds - France. Every goal was a fraud goal<br>Most pathetic world champions<br><br>Only Griezmann and Giroud were deserving world champions
Believe it or not!! I cried watching this Croatia vs France match when I saw the Croatian National Team lose. I pray that this year Croatia will be the champion.
nice
Qatar vs Ecuador its coming.........
World Cup champions, Congratulations, you have earned final game in trophy
The worst world cup ever completely ruined by var and bad teams
As a Croatian I will never forget this. I was so sad when they lost I was upset for 2 days after the final. I’m still so proud of them
I love croatia. I supported untill the final.
Hope France stays at group&#39;s phase this time. Only penaltis.
this is not a referee but a butcher absolutely shocking
horrible referee the worst ever
subasic was so bad
CROATIA WAS ROBBED
POGba!!
Right foot don’t work so used left foot. How easy it is for Pogba.
Still gives me goosebumps

Which country do you guys think is going to win this years world cup?
Africa won the world cup ✊🏾
mbope
Just can’t thanks this proper English commentary, passion for everything, should have heard him live! I was in Hong Kong and I celebrated like no tomorrow! ❤ finally and English commentator who has passion for football regardless of a full teams!
The most boring final in history, the penalty ruined the game
Pogbas goal was like a shot from training ground
That all CR7 &amp; Messi need 😂😂
Copa do Mundo 2022 final Brasil e França 🇧🇷3 🇫🇷1<br>🇧🇷🏆
Imagine if Croatia actually had a competent defense
our downfall started from here , hope we get well soon😢🙏
Its time for Argentina 🇦🇷 now
África champions
Why does it keep saying “this video is not available” 🤔
Croatia’s jersey look like Pizza Boxes😅
Mandzukic underrated af
Je suis très content qu&#39;on a colonisé beaucoup de pays en Afrique parce que sans des gens noires et islamique notre pays est rien dans le football
messi
Time files so fast and we&#39;re counting for the 2022 world cup
Can&#39;t wait to see 2022 cup
This last world cup was so boring!!! in fact I didn’t realized after 4 years Croatia made it to the final match vs France , France 98 and USA 94 were the best during my time, I hope this coming world cup becomes a classic
who else is here in anticipation for Qatar this year???
Africa
Croatia vs. Argentina 3:0,Croatia vs. france 2:4.Totally scores 5:4 win Cozzacs up Mushketeurs😁
Griezmann 🔥🔥 what a player. France scored the 1st three goals all because of him. True MVP of the 2018 World Cup.
France is the best
incredible World Cup Final
Griezmann showing no class once again.
And India doesn&#39;t even qualify.... Any suggestion or reason???🇮🇳⚽ @barryrichards
It&#39;s amazing 👍
Congratulations
Continent of Afrika vs small Croatia.... Croaria is the true winner
CROATIA WAS WONDERFUL IN THIS TOURNAMENT THEY WAS HOW BEAST VERY STRONG GUYS!!! POOR TEAM CROATIA THEY SHOULD HAVE WON WORLD CUP 2018🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😩😩😩😩😩😑😩😩😩😩😑😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
Penalty at that range can never be a penalty.
Perfect
pov: we all wanted Croatia to win 🏆
4 years later and retards are still crying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=95">1:35</a>
the worst final of world cup history
VAR ruined the final
I’m going to be honest as a Croatian the scores should have been 2-1 For France but I’m still happy Croatia made it to the finals
I will forever hate griezmann for the celebration
Can France repeat?
Update: How Kylian Mbappe got a big head. (Still a dog tho)
France🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🏆🇦🇷🇧🇷🇪🇸a great video, Would you like to see some predictions for the 2022 world cup, it&#39;s amazing.🐢🐢🐢

Bro I remember watching this finals at midnight and predicting France would win when my mom picked Croatia and I screamed when France won!
Boring final of world cup 2018 ...it was totally one side dominated by France. <br>🙆🏻🤝. <br>If it was France vs England or Germany or Belgium <br>If it was Croatia vs Belgium.<br>It would hv been a thrilling final. <br><br>France vs Croatia ,, Croatia in 2nd half had nothing to do.... It became like a Germany vs Brazil match of 2014.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsEAvRerTg&amp;t=94">1:34</a> karius moment
Croatia the most legendary team in Eastern Europe togheter with hingary
Croatia deserved to win 🇭🇷 but football now is about money now 😒 so, no surprise
Peter once again with pure poetic commentary
undeserved win

Great for Croatia..
This match was so fixed it wasn’t even funny. France overated AF
She&#39;s so beautiful
Missing Karim Benzema the most,If he was there france team was fullfilled.Eventually he is going to Qatar with that trophy and also maybe with the balon dor.
ИНТЕРЕСНО ИЗ ИНОСТРАНЦЕВ ЗНАЕТ ЛИ ГДЕ ПРОХОДИЛ ФИНАЛ НА КАКОЙ АРЕНЕ
本当はフランス対シンガポールの決勝戦でやってほしいですもっと楽しいかも
For a world cup final this seems very underwhelming
What a match.😊
What? Croatia played against France in the World Cup Final 2018? I thought they played against Africa.
The first teenager to score in world cup final since pele this was the rise of legend mbappe
how is this happened in 2018 and it&#39;s 2022 now 😮😮

Fr crying rhit now but fr
France was lucky
Argentina played better than Croatia against France,
In my opinion the top ten best teams in this world cup were<br>1 France <br>2 Belgium<br><br>3 Croatia <br>4 England<br>5 Brazil<br><br>6 russia<br>7 uruguay<br>8 sweden<br>9 Argentina <br>10 Denmark
Most of them knew that their afcon nation will never win  the wc..traitor just for fame
Croatia goalkeeper was shambolic
Perisiç goal is exceptional
This world Cup final win belongs to Africa 🌍 very few of the France players were France natives
15.jul🌱🌱🌱
Yaxşı oyunuydu ilk dünya kubokuna baxdığım
Perisic 🔥🔥
Persic:<br>Goal and assist against england in the semi final<br>Goal against france in the final<br><br>🔥
Thanks France
Nice...
So excited with this commentary
France becomes first ever African team to win the world cup
Man love my team France let’s make history viva La France
It&#39;s just absolutely incredible to see a country that exists for only 30 years with a population of 4 mil citizens,  playing in the world cup final. Although they didn&#39;t win the game, it&#39;s still stunning.
It was totally a one sided match 🙆🏻 at the end .. if it was France vz England it would hv been different i feel.
The Worst World Cup Final Ever
i have never stop watching these highlights
It’s crazy how we are 6 months away from the 2022 World Cup ! How time flies by
Man this is a cool coincidence, the 1st world cup final was 4-2
Kongo won it fair and square
Moment of madness 🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>Commentators are something else

Now that Croatian guy who scored will play with the spurs gk
glück für frankreich
This griezmann😌
Now who is after Croatia take the Revenge of the world cup 2018 final
Sad that Croatia didn&#39;t win, it would have been incredible if one of the games superpowers didn&#39;t win it, business as usual for the big team though.
Who&#39;s here after Croatia beat France?
Le van a pesar mucho las palabras a Mmbape, Francia eliminado de fase de grupos en Qatar 2022
Sadly if Croatia didn’t score an Own Goal and a handball foul, it would have been 2-2 which meant they would’ve had a chance of winning the World Cup.
my life very sad match ☹☹
FIFA world cup ខ្ញុំបាទសូមគោរព និងសូមអោយមាន ពានមាស ពានប្រាក់ ពានសំរិទ្ធ សំរាប់ការប្រកួតបាល់ទាត់ពិភពលោកម្តងៗ
I think croatia could won because they played much better than france, if you watched the game, france scored because of luck and then croatia fell apart
When commentator was saying &quot;perisić&quot;, in captions it is written as &quot;paris edge&quot;🤣🤣🤣
As a Pole I must to say, that I was really happy,when France won.<br>I was supporting France and I&#39;m proud because of that .
France will win 2022 wc in qatar

Congrats Camerun
Respect for Croatia 🇭🇷

Amazing Croatia
Imagine if England defeated Croatia in the Semi-final
The only team in history to win the world cup with only 10 players playing during the whole championship.
Dam I forgot Croatia made it to the finals
Griezman taking the L on Croatia is sending me 😂😂😂😂
who was the man &amp; women with trophy in intro ?
I really wanted Croatia to win, but better team won. I always want a new country to win world cup
Are we ready for 2022?
This still feels like yesterday
France, greatest country in the world.
Time flies like a fly
POGBOOM 🔥 🚨
Most pathetic world cup final
2022🔥
Next for France?
foreign legion vs croatia
“Pogba! POGBA!!” 🤣🤣
I like how griezman sike croatia🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still watching this
I watch this video because i really miss the best version of griezmann
quel malheur j&#39;adore la Croatie
This is the worst of all  world cup finals played  in 21st century
This is like friendly match goals
when Russia was still part of the world.
Gate ball use the brain
ma sta nas briga. Francuze dočekali  sa praznim ulicama, a Hrvate sa slavljem koda su pobjednici. Te noći se Zagreb zapalio i orio od slavlja. Ponosan sam što sam Hrvat 🇭🇷❤️💪
I can remember watching  this with my dad
Next follow the planet cup event
Boring final
mon matuidi mon ami t un vrai guerrier
Pogba in EDF is one of the best midfielders of the world.
Croatia  is very  dangerous  futbol national  team against  everyone. <br>Amazing
Próximos Finalistas: Argentina vs España, y lo gana España
Sve neki Afrikanci u Francuza
It was so funny when greizmann scored that penalty and did Take the L
مبارات  رئع
I was in Munich Germany that time.. in India you don&#39;t see so much craze but back there though Germany was out of the world Cup but still there was football madness all over.. once France won all over the road people were celebrating.. bear, bottle of whiskey and dancing, honking, it was delight to see that craze..i too got some celebration with locals, French...still relish those photos..
Man, 2018 was something that you would like to go back to.
look at my video where Griezmann dived, thanks ref!!
