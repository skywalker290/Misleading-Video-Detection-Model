I&#39;m not crying that pewdiepie left. I just got some glitter in my eye or something I swear.
Ok that was not a respectable time to find pee pee island I have found it much faster on my schools laggy computer starting from Russia with the globe upside down p.s. my best time is 7 secs (on the laggy computer) I bet I could get a sub 4
I love you

Joe mama 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know big pp is not my choice.
They are buying quackers
Whenever Felix grows out his beard, his personality turns a complete 180 and starts looking at the weirdest shit 😂
Bahahahah he called Abraham Lincoln Barack Obama 😂😂😂😂😂
&quot;It&#39;s peepee island I know the coordinates!&quot;
Name every gamer moment? Trick question, they’re all epic gamer moments
okbuddyretard has so many layers of irony you could slice it and eat it like a cake at this point
Family guy funny moments #2
If you see this comment you are also a main character like me.

Skipped my meme but at least my name was in the vid

Not that that is a threat it&#39;s more of a known fact of tomatos
I don&#39;t like asparagus and pop eye
Instead of short end violence
Which is so violent that is submissive and then violent
I think it&#39;s like passive agressive

Gotta say, I like that Pewds is living his best life in Japan right now, still I miss the daily updates / Reddit - LWAY videos. They used to be a part of my “routine”: just opening YT waiting for Pewds to update. Still, good for him, he deserves it

Glad my paternal swedish twin still makes me laugh bro
He has so many videos that rewatching is like watching the first time sometimes, which is great!
The Obama saying pewdiepie is great was pretty convincing ngl
How does this sub Reddit suit pewdiepie so much

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzMyW9TCXp0&amp;t=560">9:20</a> the f-word?????! My child is watching this video. I want to talk to the superiors.
What in the actual fuck is small chungus? I even looked it up and it makes absolutely no fucking sense whatsoever.
Enjoying this subreddit is like enjoying League of Legends
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzMyW9TCXp0&amp;t=578">9:38</a> no, it&#39;s Rick and morty
did he get canceled for saying the r word at all? lmao it&#39;s funny like I never saw anything
Which subreddit is this
I tried showing this vid to a Karen...

This. This is when it happened. This is where the downfall began. I hope you know the subreddit is dying because of something you did a year ago.

Imagine being so petty that something you like gets &quot;ruined&quot; by a very popular YouTuber.

Apparently I disliked this video? I don’t remeber why but I’ll see if I can remember rewatching it
Tell me why I, a female, rose my hand when Felix asked the guys to raise their hands of they wouldn&#39;t just put their peepee in another guy.

I think after this video came out, or at least at about that time, I saw a post that photoshopped pewds into a shirt that said, &quot;Forget what I said when I was gaming&quot; and that&#39;s when I knew, the subreddit was perfect

The tomadachi life musical was genius
I bet you some chad in the comments will name every epic gamer moment
be careful voiceover sam got de platformed for supposedly asking people for their credit card number and it being a scam when it was clearly a damn joke.
pewds now: nice short clean cut haircut<br>pewds back in 2011: I think I will cut and style my hair like Justin Bieber
dang ur hair grows fast. You should let it grow long again. Like the Justin Bieber haircut you had when you were younger. Except let it keep on growing until it&#39;s like Rockstar long. That will be a cool eyes look

Holy shit dude you killed this subreddit good. It used to be funny but it’s now infested with autistic children who make up the majority of your audience. I hope you’re glad of the fact that any community or subreddit you come into contact with will be ruined by you. Okbr used to be an obscure and hilarious subreddit where people who actually posted memes because they wanted to make others laugh. Now it’s basically pewdiepiesubmissions2, a subreddit full of dumbass kids who think spamming the same 4 reaction meme formats which got stale 6 months ago is funny. Pewdiepie, please do the world a favor and delete your channel before you ruin anything more. It’s clear even you no longer enjoy making videos. I mean, if I had to do like a 1000 videos of YLYL I’d probably kill myself even if I was being paid millions for it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzMyW9TCXp0&amp;t=308">5:08</a> i thought he was talking about the fact you actually have extra length inside you and that&#39;s how extension pills work
bro i swear if there are any 9 year old kids who actually gave away one of their parent’s credit cards
The speedrunning guy isn&#39;t a speed runner. He is Npesta, and he verified a super hard geometry dash level called &quot;Kenos&quot; and made the reaction
Lol imagine being mad because now ur “ultra-special-secret-subreddit” got popular. They probably unironically call people who don’t like their retarded humor ‘normies’ and act like they’re smarter than everybody else. But they think they’re clever cause they do stuff iRoNiCaLlY, and circle jerk each other with ur reposted memes. They’re literally wastes of space
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzMyW9TCXp0&amp;t=42">0:42</a> Unfortunately, no, you’re gonna have to pay for it.

Pewdiepie: Sees Full Metal Alchemist                       Him: Is that JoJo?

It made me die when u said &quot;is this Jojo?&#39;
I&#39;ve seen that this video brought up a lot of controversy, especially since the reddit mods shut down the sub, so I have a small suggestion. Maybe in the future if you were to review a smaller subreddit, you could just leave the title undisclosed/censored so the viewers can still enjoy the memes and the redditors won&#39;t be constantly set off every time one of these videos comes out. It&#39;s such an unnecessary feud at this point.
