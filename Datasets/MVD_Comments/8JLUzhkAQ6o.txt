Notice the NSX has its antena up going over the hill and then all of a sudden its down...<br><br>Wish we could have seen it and the trans am later on
Why couldn’t he get early parole? That’s horrible. He didn’t kill anyone.
That Honda nsx 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Look at the buster... still grannyshifting.
I love how this scene plays tribute to the 3 Hondas from the first movie as all the cars are black just like the Hondas and they in formation similar to the first movie
Why are Tego and Leo even here, they never really did anything.
Then it went horrible wrong in the 5th movie, gave the 6th another chance. But damn, even some of the worst Winnie-the-Pooh movies were better in my opinion.<br>Will never understand why people keep watching.
That &#39;wheeeeee&#39; melts me😭😭😭
Why dom smiled?
F&amp;F 4 has so many incredible scenes. One of the best F&amp;F movies and criminally underrated
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=73">1:13</a> that gear shift for..🙂❤
We not gon mention how Brian shifted into 1st
imagine adam and belle&#39;s joy when they know that eric ariel lumiere and cogsworth are going to break them out off the prison bus
I love the look on Jordana Brewsters face as shes shifting gears
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=50">0:50</a> love Mia hairstyle.very hot❤🎉
Fast And furious - Dominic &#39;s Prison juvenile Connectional Felicity<br>By Los Angeles sheriff Department
That NSX was clean 🔥
That gear shifting from Brain gives me goosebumps. <br><br>It’s 2023, still can’t believe Paul is gone .. may his soul rest in peace ❤

DOMESTIC TORETTO COPS
FAST AND FURIOUS 2009 MOVIE
They&#39;ve been making a fast and furious movie every 2 years. And this is where it started. The franchise has gotten really annoying in recent years. To the point where I&#39;ve become a hater. If I had a time machine I would go back in time to this moment and tell Brian and Mia not to break Dom out of prison. Because as hard as it may be to watch him go off to jail, it&#39;s ultimately what&#39;s best for their family and everybody else. Trust me.
one of my top ending movie scene of all time with a perfect transition to credits
There the knights of the round templar
He only has 11 more years to serve. Dom about to be free!
I don’t know if anyone has noticed but in the credits the charger turns into a challenger
I&#39;m gonna cry
4
I always crack up when Tego Calderon &amp; Don Omar are arguing in Spanish.
Fuck that lmaoo
Honda NSX,I love you Angel 👌😌💞🔱
Honestly I think this was my favourite scene. Jordana and Paul did an amazing job and I loved it so much my face literally lit up as soon as I realised they were here to save dom ❤❤❤ forever love this movie
Nsx
didn&#39;t Dom said that he&#39;s NOT running anymore? Here his crew broke him out to be a wanted fugitive in Fast 5.
We all thought that dom could go to no prison😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=15">0:15</a>
Epic
Jordana Brewster driving Is the Best of the movie... Even better than Gal My love Gadot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=64">1:04</a> I like how Brian looks at Mia. He’s proud of her.
Am I the only one that realised Brian took the licence plate from his Blue R34 in fast 4 and put it on the charger that he rebuilt for Dom
Dom knew what time it was when he heard his charger switching gears yesss sirrrr
Better cliffhanger than Fast X
Lompoc is not a maximum security prison lol. The inmates are allowed to roam outside the prison walls 😂
The only time Brian drove dom’s car
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=73">01:13</a> I like Dom&#39;s smile. He recognized his monster engine and realized that it was Brian because of that granny shifting(shifting too early).
Only time Brian drove a V8 supercharger 😂
This is the most underrated F&amp;F movie and my fave. It was all about Dom, Brian, Mia and Letty. And still had several racing scenes. The recent movies have like 30 different characters and no real racing
seeing Brian drive Dom&#39;s charger just put a smile to your face.
NSX ❤
I’m here for nsx 😮
Even Best Movie Got a Great Ending Keeps Coming Back
Mia in the NSX 😍
Are we just going to forget Leo and Santos in the Trans-Am?
that NSX.......................... (and the woman driving it ofc)
Toño tu que intentas de animarme? Me a hecho gracia el video de mota😊
The film which inspired me to drive a car

ok its all good but lets talk about the fact he switched to first at 60mph &lt;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=30">0:30</a>
So badass seeing brian drive the charger here!
ill never forgive them for ruining this franchise.
That judge screwed up horribly giving Dom the maximum sentence even when he willingly allowed himself to be arrested.  The system only validated Dom&#39;s belief to keep running and breaking the law.  Just an epically bad decision.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=49">0:49</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=51">0:51</a> her smile reminds me how much she has an awesome taste in cars
To be continued to Fast Five
After seeing the trailer for Fast X I can assume FX will have a similar movie ending like the 4th movie since FX is only Part 1 of the finale

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
for normal people driving a car is just that but for people like us who love to accelerate and feel the power of the engine is a dream...
Mia&#39;s NSX is sooooo fucking pretty 😩
Love this scene

when ff  still make sense... before 8
Top velozes e furiosos 4 adoro sou fã todos
There&#39;s a not so big problem I&#39;ve been dealing with this film for years now and yet nobody answered, so here is my question, how did Dom&#39;s Charger got rebuild from being exploded to perfectly conditioned? I know it&#39;s just a movie but how?
Imagine them waving at him goodbye and just drive off
Brian went from being the ‘buster’ to brother in the movie
Single handledly the best 3 car line-up in FF history. Genuinely impossible to chose which one to actually own if you could only choose one.

The Buster got him out of handcuffs. Once again.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=55">00:55</a> Do they ever stop arguing? :)))))
While watching this movie for the first time I thought that oh no ....it shouldn&#39;t end like this ...but when these cars came into the scene ......daaaamn 🔥🔥
First two movie: best<br>Tokyo drift: nice try!<br>This one: not bad!<br>Fast five: ok<br>Furious 6: not bad<br>Furious 7: great ending tho<br>Furious 8: ok just stop<br>9: enough!<br>10: XD

fast five is the best of all time
As what bernie mac once said &quot;the driver don&#39;t pick the car the car pick the driver, it&#39;s a mythical bond between man and machine&quot; never won&#39;t forget those words
I dont want to cry, why am I always crying …..
DEV
But how did the bus tip over the bus was to strong and can destroy the whole car nose
I love that Charger, but that Trans Am though!!
i&#39;ve learned that Mia loves Hondas. She drove the Blue Integra in the first movie, there was an integra in the beginning of this movie and now she&#39;s in a NSX

You have to watch From this scene to the last scene of 6th part. Rest after that is bull crap!!!

Aveți dreptate să fiți furios....

Hearing that blower whistle and that big block pulling numbers up alongside the bus when Brian chops to 1st makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up like a hardon every time!
My old love
where the Charger came from ?
Funny to think how Tyrese was supposed to be in the third car that Tego and Leo were in, but he couldn&#39;t keep his mouth closed about being in the film.

Mia looks sooo bad ass driving the NSX ..
Two comments:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=63">1:03</a> Who the hell is in the background?  All those cars were together.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=73">1:13</a> Shifting in to first gear at ~75mph would cause the transmission and/or motor to explode if you even managed to get it in the gear in the first place.
Brian driving the charger is epic, but still dom didn&#39;t drove an r34
sooo um where was the chase?
Then the start of the next movie was them rescuing him
Wieder kein Mercedes oder bmw ?<br>Ne warum auch ,passt einfach nicht .weil das commerz Autos sind.<br>Allein der nsx ist so cool.
Xạo bà cố,vận chuyển tù nhân cả đống thế kia mà chỉ vỏn vẹn cái xe buýt.
Wow @ Mia driving the NSX …
How did this get us to flying fieros in space?
Now that&#39;s the way to have a brothers back
The most unrealistic part is having California plates on these cars. You can&#39;t even install a aftermarket exhaust in California, yet alone turbos and other stuff.

Out of all the fast and furious this one is probs my favourite. Especially the ending! Goosebumps every time!
Its fast 5 not 4
In reality Dom would have died it that fatal bus crash, and the next movie would start with his funeral.
When you see O&#39;connor driving American Muscle, you know someone must have really messed up bad, and they are about to pay 😬

who need prison when you got family
Modern trans am looks lit
To be fair, the court did not hold up their end of the deal. They promised to clear Dom’s name for bringing in Braga, and they just said “No, no I don’t think I will” and sent him to prison anyway.

These movies aren&#39;t good.

He said he did 2 years at Lompoc in the first movie and he was going to die before he went back but he was pretty close to going back

how the hell did brian get dons charger back after dom hopped out of it in the tunnel
I wish I had reliable boys like him
Fun to see a bus I built in a movie. It&#39;s a now outdated bus, should see the current models of prison coaches. Absolute tanks.
Family...
This is the exact moment F&amp;F started to be a nonsense action movie
Right before this scene Dom tells a wounded Brian leaning by a car that he isn&#39;t running anymore.<br><br>This scene: <b>*proceeds to escape anyway*</b>
The law maybe strong, but not as strong as family.
Did that little old school drum and bass track hit anyone else&#39;s souls?
Why did Brian downshift to 1st 🤣🤣
that nsx 8=======================D
Family is the strongest element
Good thing he’s always got family watching his back.
Omg the ending😂
Lompoc prison security is strong, but not as strong as family
That sweet NSX daaaaaaaaaaambn
That nsx doe…
Dom did get screwed as he risked his life to get Braga
FAMILY
Don&#39;t worry dom, u have a family
That damn NSX honda is unreak
There nothing strong than FAMILY.
I love American muscle but damn that NSX is sexy AF
For family
<b>People who are watching this comments, I wish their parents still Alive for more than 100 years, God bless u and u r family 💚💛💗</b>

This is a very good movie

Fast 9 Dom can break the chains with his bare hands
The downshifting in the Charger, Dom knows Brian is coming to get him.
It was at this moment, Dom joined the avengers
At the time I think I was back and forth, either they were just riding off with him for the last time or they were about hijack the bus like they have been doing with trucks. Even in the hijacking, turned out like nothing logically expected(movie).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=47">0:47</a> Mia and her nsx is my favorite part
And this mechanic Dom beats trained military officer Hobbs and trained assassin Jakob

Good god that NSX is breathtakingly beautiful. And so is Jordana Brewster driving 😍
That smile when you know that you&#39;re not going to jail <br>    🔥👌🏾🔥👌🏾👌🏾🔥
after the end of FF4: &#39;&#39;man I sure hope they show what ingenious method they use to break Dom out of that bus&#39;&#39;<br>beginning of Fast 5: &#39;&#39;&#39;oh they literally just tip it over and crash it. I forgot the &#39;family&#39; is made of supermen at this point.
Mia looks so badass here.... 🤘
Mia’s taste in cars is just absolutely bootiful
Esse carro de rabeta é um dos q mais procuro no GTA San Andreas
Ye fast and furuois 5 ka hai scene
Me in gtao when I had to steal the prison bus 🚎 😂
IBROXIM
That nsx tho
Yes, he pulled off heists but a life in prison for that?
It&#39;s good when Paul drives the V8
What’s the name of the Honda
curious after shooting this scene for fast 4, they they already begin shooting fast 5 after? Because of the opening scene of Fast 5
I love this scene because you really don’t get to see Mia driving
Brian must have been like, This is very uncomfortable
I was surprised seeing Brian drive the Charger then i realised ... who else could even drive that monster
25 to life for not killing anyone. Fuck?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=42">0:42</a> The NSX has a fat radio antennae <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=47">0:47</a> it’s gone
Can some1 plz explain how Brian got Dom’s charger back when it was literally blown to smithereens in the cartel tunnel ????
Mia is beautiful in this scence . Lover her😍😍. Always come to see her .
Word of advice boys: don&#39;t ever stop your 69-70 charger in front of a prison bus thinking it&#39;s gonna stop 😂.
The fact that we only got to see Paul Walker in a Charger for just that moment was something we had to treasure.
This was the last movie in the franchise where it was actually believable and no outlandish gravity defying stunts.
I always liked the arguing brothers
For rescuing Dom, fuck the entire men on the bus. Yeah, that&#39;s the family we are talking about.
Dom: Looks through the window and sees car plate:<br><br>Front Plate: EMRGNCY (backs up car)<br><br>Back Plate: EXTNOW<br><br>Dom: 😏
The best ending scene of the series
Soon as he heard that downshift he knew who it was, “the Buster brought me back”
Theres only two guys Dom is gonna EVER let drive that Trademark Dodge Charger, Brian, and Doms son
Yo can someone explain how Brian is driving that charger? I thought it blew up in the tunnel when Dom switched cars
Anyone else just realized the charger was an automatic?
Can someone please temme, What Tego and Don were talking ?
Bro the best car line up ever
that ws cool
It mades me happy to see Brian in the charger
The thing that always pissed me off was that Dom had just helped nail a drug lord to the wall and instead of being given immunity was being sent up to federal prison.
That NSX🔥
Jos
This might be the only time we see Mia actually driving fast (and furious). She has had a cool Integra in F1 and a sweet NSX in F4, but no other prominent cars that were &quot;hers&quot;
The comic comedy of the two spanish is awesome
Should have went to credits right at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=41">0:41</a> to keep it suspenseful and have people excited for the next one

Such a horrible franchise! What started out as an undercover cop infiltrating an underground street racers, turned out to be street racers taking down drug lords, solving crimes that the FBI or local authorities can&#39;t solve! Don&#39;t get me started on these cars being able to defy the laws of physics 🙄

I must say....I had a crush on Mia(Jordana Brewster) when I was young haha

Great scene, but who on earth takes an nsx to an prison escape
Legend has it they were trolling Dom. They ended up just driving past him and going to party on the beach.

I love brian driving the charger 💙
Does anyone find it funny how Dom is sentenced to 25 -life without the chance of early parole but yet at the end of each movie subsequently he is able to gain his freedom by helping the cops, or Hobbs I should say, with some big issue. What happened to no parole? 25-life? Now I&#39;m not complaining I am just curious. Does anyone get to earn their freedom from that high a sentence in one fell swoop?
This is fast five
Already at highway speed, Brian downshifts into 1st? Lol
That NSX in this scene doesnt get enough credit

bruh the firebird trans though.
I wonder if the NSX is the heaviest car out of all of those. It was an insanely heavy for being a sports car.

Lol what a bullshit. No police escort at all ?
Trash....you edit and post like you wear socks on your hands, so you have an excuse why you post trash and lies. You lying sock puppet.
Two places to leave your brain at the door.    A church or a movie theater showing a Fast and Furious movie.    One will want you to believe in flying horses and talking snakes.    The other wants you to believe you can parachute a 4,000 lb car into dense woods, land on all fours and casually drive away.    Both are equally ridiculous.

When Mia Brian and Others were Chasing the Bus Then Dom Thinks that that&#39;s My Families
When Dom was being transported to prison, I thought there was no more hope til I saw the three cool cars chasing after the bus then I knew Dom was gonna be rescued. True friends don&#39;t run away, they come help..

Man there&#39;s not one comment on how dope Mia is looking in this scene after stayinf tired and bored throughout the entirety of the film

That smile was the beginning of the fuck up franchise
One of the best endings in this series, damn r.i.p Paul Walker 🙏🏾
that NSX :)
Hijacking this bus on it&#39;s way to Maximum security seems much easier than the DVD Player TRUCKS ROFL 😂
I wish that NSX had more screen time
The most badass, epic scene of jordana brewster. She looks so cute, hot, beautiful and cool as fck here.
This scene alone changed me from a F &amp; F fan to a DIE HARD F &amp; F fan!!!!!
I remember when I first seen this. I couldn’t believe what they were about to do!!!!
Don y tego 😍
Notice how Brian took the charger to first gear and Dom is like &quot;that&#39;s my charger yeah&quot;
Pffft uh huh
I would be happy for yhis to be the end of the series.<br><br>Go out with the gang busting dom out dont show the escape just end on doms smile as he realises.<br><br>Not f5 f6 f7 etc end on this movie

One of the best scenes ever! Tho I still like the Fast 5 and Furious 7 ending better
❤❤❤
That Smirk when Dom hears the charger roaring through is so epic!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=74">1:14</a> the face you make when you hear the sound of your old car that still sounds the same after selling it a decade ago.
🇰🇭YE.

The whistle of the supercharger gives me goosebumps... sad to see you go Paul Walker. You brought a dynamic to the F &amp; F series that was unique only to you.

I remember how awesome it was to see Brian drive the charger! R.I.P. Paul Walker
I love that firebird
This was the best way to end the franchise.
Sais le 5

Easily the best ending in the franchise.

حلو
Of doms charger have been destroyed on the tunel how brain get him?
Can someone explain to me why, when and how torreto got arrested cuz i have not watched this movie and i probably still wont understand even if i do watch the movie
VERY NICE MUSIC
trop cool ses mecs
Fast five opening :D
I have all parts of fast n furios
Just listen to that engine at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JLUzhkAQ6o&amp;t=45">00:45</a>, music to my ears, I do like this Charger but it&#39;s nothing compared to the one in the first film, and it was rare to see Brian driving a muscle car, besides this scene the only other muscle car he drove was the Camaro in the 2nd film, and three black cars, reminds me a lot of the truck hijackings in the first film
Can someone explain how Brian is driving Dom’s car? Dom’s car blew up in the border tunnel when he switched vehicles.  Or did nobody else notice that...?  And yet it’s still here, and in 5 when Dom says to Vince - Mia thinks it’s a curse.  Am I missing something?
