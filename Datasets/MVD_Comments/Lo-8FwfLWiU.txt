Pastor Hulk. Amen to that brothers. And what are you gonna do when pastor reigns on you!!

Who throws a dog in the ocean😡
The jerk who threw the dog should have been thrown in front of the Hulkster!
Hulk hogan is an American treasure

In college, i took an asian culture class, because i heard it was really easy and would count for an actual class.<br>Anyways, during the last few weeks of class, we got to watch movies about asian history, including the last samurai.<br>Diring the scenewhere the army was grouping together, one of the students in my class suddenly busted out laughing. He was straight up laughing his lungs off. He was laughing so hard, my teacher had to pause the movie and explain as to why he was laughing so hard.<br>He explained the in the background, one of the army men got hit in the nuts by the horse, and when the teacher played it back, we could all see what happened and everyone just busted out laughing, even the teacher. It was so funny and was the highlight of my time in that class.
PASTAMANIA!!!!    best thing in video
Bullshit.  The whole scene with the can in the head is a lie.
thanks for the demo de kd8ifj
Dude got kicked in the nutts should of got the 700 dollars a day

Aww poor kitty♡<br>And i have to mention that i threw a fit of giggle as that storm trooper hit his head 😂
Akashay
Haahaa
I&#39;m not sure if you are saying the truth,
All I can think of is...that poor cat🙀
Throwing a dog in the water or the ocean is completely cruel. I’m an animal lover and I would never do that to my dog. Whoever did that should feel really bad. My father wants threw my dog in the lake to try to get him to like water., And terrified the dog and made him so scared of water he wouldn’t go anywhere near the lake. I would gently walk him to the lake in overtime taught him that the water wasNot scary. I gently would stand in the water with treats and talk to him to climb in the water with me. And eventually we will swim together. It took many summers to get him used to the water. I think it’s important to point out in this video that that was a really uncool thing to do. Also the old days they should try to teach children to swim in the same way. Pretty much terrifying the child On occasion children and adults drowned this way. I would just to soon people use good judgment when trying to work with living creatures. I know this is not directly related to the movie but it touches a sore spot
Woow
How about the airplane flying in the movie Troy?
Time Traveler
I saw an episode of The Patty Duke Show: The Greatest Psychologist in the World. In the soda shop scene when Patty is talking to her boyfriend,  there&#39;s a black kid in a striped shirt sitting beside him. But when they cut back to Patty, he&#39;s walking in and stopped for a brief moment at the counter then walks away. When back on boyfriend, he&#39;s sitting talking with another kid.
Try Movie, “JAWS”...after they get drunk on the ship, the shark hits the boat and they all come up on deck...dawn is breaking and twice in the background there’s an unidentifiable flying object that flies by really fast.
The whole Pirates of the Caribbean movie, was a mistake.
All of these 😂😂😂😂😂
I watch that movie but don&#39;t remember the cat freaking out in it

What is wrong with throwing the dog into the water. The dog would have loved it.
It&#39;s not a movie but I found the coffee cup in Game of Thrones final season pretty lit.. coz it&#39;s hot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=168">2:48</a> you can see the twin towers on fire
what is strange is that johnny depp could not act his way out of a wet paper bag
I remember the rumor of an actual ghost being filmed in one of the &quot;Three Men and A Baby&quot; movies. I think it was disproven, but it freaked people out for awhile.
Getting kicked in the groin by a horse instantly gives you elephant balls.
For the first one there, who got the raise? The director or the extra or the actor?
What about the &#39;shooting star&#39; scene from jaws?
Hulk Hogan is a scholar and a gentleman .
The cat lmao
The cowboy is Jerry Reed from Smokey and the bandit !!!!!!!
That&#39;s great!
Am I the only idiot that stood and wondered for 2 minutes and thought the title said: “Stranger Things Accidentally filmed in movies” ?
You missed the ghost in three men and a baby!!!!! Little boy in a top hat standing behind the curtain in the living
The ghost boy in theovue Three Men and a baby.
The film 1900 made back in the 70&#39;s has more amazing<br>things in the background then probably any film made.<br>Frame by frame it is nothing but easter eggs.
When you just work as the crew on the set of a pirate movie, yet are still mistaken for one.
OH MAH GOD I LOVE HARRY POTRY IS SO COOL MAN
Strangest Things Accidentally Filmed In Movies...and you show Johnny Depp. Something to consider.
I wonder if that Samurai extra got a bonus? Seems to me that a retake of the scene would have been costly.
That may have been the creepiest pasta I have ever come across.
You said to check out strange things in movies. 20 movie mistakes you never notice. That video is 11 though..
It be better if the music didn&#39;t drown out your voice.
I&#39;d read once that a red small car was passing by on the horse chariot scene on Charton Heston&#39;s Ben Hur. It is that true?
My family has a history of throwing smelly reluctant dogs into water.

That cat was a real PUSSY.
Vid publisher&#39;s comment, in the Notes under the vid:  &quot;We&#39;re addicted to all things super-hero and Star Wars, but we&#39;re not afraid to binge watch some reality TV when the mood strikes.&quot;  I hope they&#39;re just speaking for themselves, and not assuming that&#39;s true of everyone.  Star Wars (the original movie, the 1980s sequels &amp; maybe some of the later sequels/prequels) was good, the original Batman show and Superman movie were good--but I couldn&#39;t care less about later incarnations of Batman or Superman, much less other &quot;superheros&quot;, and the same with any &quot;reality TV&quot;...ugh.
Too bad I never saw any of these movies...
Hulk Hogan had a good movie where he was Santa Claus and this church was closing down
LOL , the dog
i am a very naughty boy and am going set the World on fire no one can stop me

Why on earth would you want to hit a horses foot with your groin..??
What a load of completely pointless s*** absolutely no f*<b>*</b> given
I really wish you didnt throw in the last one about the dog, now im gonna have nightmares. I hope it was alive as it was getting thrown into the water, I hope that it is safe and made it out ok, and I hope that demonic bastard douchebag got caught and died a painful horrible death.
What happened to the DOG? <br>I don&#39;t give half a shiit about Hulk Hogan...
I laughed about the dog getting thrown into the ocean. I&#39;m sure it was fine. I&#39;ve seen dogs and their owners play like that around water. The dog was probably running back out to the owner each time to have it done again and again.
WWE produced a lot of freaks.

There’s a scene in LOTR when lady galadriel is in the boat, on the left side of the screen there’s a guy standing in the water, he’s dressed like a crew member.( it’s in the beginning of the movie btw.)
Poor dog....
In 1996 scientists decided that human exploration of Mars was necessary.<br><br>One man would go, but none would return.<br><br>They needed a true hero, a man with nothing to lose. <br><br>A man who has everything.<br><br>Can do anything.<br><br>Can be anything.<br><br>so they chose The World&#39;s Fattest Man.<br><br><br>In order to give the worlds fattest man true courage, the US government paid 1 Billion Dollars to any and all sexy celebrity women who would sleep with the world&#39;s fattest man.<br><br><br>Once sexing all the women of his dreams, the world&#39;s fattest man (henceforth referred to as the worlds fattest man or 1tonstramrolleverything) had nothing to lose.<br><br>He then, of course, agreed to go on a One Man Suicide Mission to Mars.<br><br>To Save Us All.<br><br><br>The Rocket that carried 1tonsteamrolleverything to his destination was the B-128-22--1-n!. Shaped like a coconut crab, and sprayed top down with internet memes, the craft was deemed invincible.<br><br>Inside The Craft the worlds fattest man would ride around is in Rascall, or simply SteamRoll in small spurts to get around, eat, or sex the many many women provided by the holodeck.<br><br>Upon landing, 1tonsteamrolleverything looked up at the Sun and began his long trek to the top of Olympus Mons. <br><br>The entire world watched him, we laughed, cried, and Anne Hathaway said that she would never ware underware again in his honor. <br><br>eventually the worlds fattest man reached his destination.<br><br><br>NASA said, &quot;OK 1ton, it&#39;s time to do your thing, good luck and godspeed&quot;<br><br>He said &quot;STEEEAAAMMMMROOOOLLLLLL EVVVVEEERRYYYYTHIINNGG!!!&quot; <br><br>Then he bit down on all the yummy cyanide pills he could, detonated the Nuke, and SteamRolled.<br><br><br>He rolled on<br><br>and on<br><br>and on and on<br><br>and saved us all.<br><br>And so everyone on Earth got attractive and then got laid.<br><br>And freedom and food and drugs populated the world.<br><br>and Rainbows, everywhere.<br><br>The Universe was conquered much sooner than thought as a result.<br><br>The govt made catgirls and everyone liked that too.<br><br><br>Thank you sexy celebrity women<br><br>Thank you worlds fattest man.<br><br><br>One day we to will learn to SteamRoll, perhaps on Earth too.<br><br>We will teach our children, and our childrens children what ne can really do the second they hit 1 Ton.<br><br><br>One day<br><br>to save us all<br><br>Once again

Loved it. masterpiece!<br><br>think fast! 🍺😲
last samurai title should be lost samurai balls
Johnny Depp in my opinion is Despicable
You know the decapitated head that Brad Pitt got at the end of the movie Seven??? IT WAS AN ACTUALLY DECAPITED HEAD SENT FROM A MAD POSTMAN WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING. LIKE THIS TO SPREAD THE HORRIBLE TRUTH ABOUT HOLLYWOOD
They picked up a time traveling cowboy. LOL.

Poor cat, poor dog, poor dick😂😂😂
Dr. Evil appears in You only live twice waaaaay before Austin Powers
They don&#39;t mention the scene in collateral where random wolves cross the streets at night? That scene was amazing.

My personal favorites are tractor tire tracks in the plowed ground when they ware supposed to be in the 17-1800s.... And the grass strip in the center of the old roads, we all know back then the horse drawn wagons kept the center of the roads torn all to pieces.
in the crimson pirate in the distance from the pirate ship u can see a cruise ship.
i liked gotham 😏
HULK HOGAN &lt;&lt; THE F SUCKER IS RACIST AND PLAIN.. Him and JOHN WAYNE.. Freaking BALDHEADED NUT JOB. DOUCHE BAG.
Heh Heh made me chuckle
things like this i wanna see, fun and funny.. not that previous creepy lost tape that has been found
I love looper
<b>I remember raking leaves near my parents creek, and a stray dog kept nipping at my big brothers pant leg. He eventually, nipped my brother. My brother grabbed the dog, by the scruff of it&#39;s neck, and threw the dog half-way across the creek. That dog learned the doggy paddle that day. LMAO</b>
the dog was probably trained to swim
I hope that kid who throw the dog will be throw by a random person to the sea
Okay let me just say, yeah I feel sorry for that cat being scared and everything, but that whole but where the cat was shitting itself to get away had me crying. At least it wasn&#39;t hurt
It is on &quot; This Is Us&quot; TV show. Which The Backstreet Boys recorded 7 years ago as an album in 2009, called &quot; This is US&quot;, HITS INCLUDED, &quot;PDA&quot;, &quot;Bye, Bye, Love&quot;, &quot; You&#39;re The Girl&quot;, &quot; Straight Through My Heart&quot;, &quot;Bigger&quot;, &amp; &quot; Masquerade&quot;.
The Backstreet Boys at the bar in the club, Holly( Mandy Moore) during The Pittsburgh Steelers Super bowl.She toured with them 17 years ago.
this is legit. : there&#39;s a early kevin bacon film(can&#39;t remember which one) that clearly shows a ufo...and no it wasn&#39;t a flying pig or any other pun
what is the name of the song? it&#39;s sounds cool
in the movie Drumline there is a shooting star when they are doing the additions
OMG! THAT POOR CAT! HE WAS BEING FORCED TO BE IN THAT SCENE. THEY SHOULD HAVE USED A CGI CAT. EVERYONE SHOULD BOYCOTT THIS MOVIE AND IT SHOULD BE PULLED FROM THE SHELVES. OMG!
lol the cat looked like it was going to pop an eyeball!!
One scene in Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter has Loretta Lynn and her husband shopping in a general store.  This was set during the early 60s.   There&#39;s a brief shot of modern day candy.  It was shot in the early 80s.
Huge credits to the actor playing Blofeldt. Keeping his cool, controlling the scene, not flubbing the lines, all the while having a frenzied claw-monster in his arms.
Indigenous species possession officially compensation witness pine dozen restriction.
in the movie twister there is a scene  where Joe and her soon to be x husband  are in the red truck and and while he&#39;s keeping his I on the road  Joe is telling him go left go right and then then something ( smashes the right  side of the windshield  clearly  cracking the glass and then right where Joe is sitting  on the passenger  side  ) when there is a house in the middle  of  the  road  the windshield  is not cracked and yells I think we&#39;re  going  in!!! and they go straight  through  the  house I haven&#39;t  seen it in awhile so you have to watch  it to see.And when they  do go thru  the house things that should  have been broken  off thd top ov the truck didn&#39;t  break off,
He just didnt want his dog to dry up thats all.

hulk hogan that was a good movie

Those cat scratches must have hurt hahahaha XD he kept his composure for sure though.
my dog misty loved being thrown in ocean
People throw dogs in water all the time. It&#39;s fun for the dog.
WTF, who would throw a dog into the ocean and why?
that horse kick was epic
Cat be like <br>Let the fuck go baldy <br>😿😹😹😹
can we all take a moment to honor that samurai for taking that punishment
They should have given the cat a seditive to calm it down. Throwing the dog was pretty funny. How could they not catch that.
The guy in the back in Pirates is Dariusz Wolski, the DP.
what was with the cat?
that James Bond cat joke was pretty gold. shakin not stirred lol
It was me I was thrown into the sea
are we not going to do anything about this s*** I was just going to send around like a bunch of pussies

Wait! Hulk Hogan had a restaurant?
I thought it said stranger things... God I&#39;m too addicted
20 movie mistakes is unavailable???
Who throws a dog in the ocean? At least use a river so it washes away quickly, leaving no evidence but a very scared dog downstream
The Malcovitch bit was scripted. The man himself said it.
is hulk hogan African??? who applies Caucasian cream to look white?
hulk Hogan is torque from borderlands

A parked car in brave heart? How have I not seen that
Oh, wow. My dog would probably love that. He&#39;s a complete water junkie.
I know that it&#39;s not funny to guys who&#39;ve been kicked in the nether region before but I couldn&#39;t stop laughing at that horse kicking that poor guy in the crotch
THAT CAT!!! LOLOLOLOL
Disappointed classic herb sponsor airplane well.
the cat part was funny
The scene with Bloefield&#39;s cat just added to the character, IMHO. Dude is a monster.
Thought that it was poc
horse kick to the balls and didnt flinch. should have stuck that spear up the bad tempered buggers arse
The dog one made me cry
Pastamania????? Thx God I never got to see that
One my brother noticed growing up in the original ninja turtles movie.  After they first meet April and bring her to meet Splinter in the sewers and they have pizza.  When they are exiting the sewers you see clearly either Donatello or Leonardo, sword or staff on the back of the first to exit,  a second later it shows Michelangelo as the first out..  Not a big one but was still neet to catch a screw up..
The horse kicking the guy in Last Samura is awesome. Kinda is a nice little visualization for Cruises career isn&#39;t it? lol
Poor dog
That cat just cracked me up. I know I should feel a bit worse than I actually do for the cat but come on, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=128">2:08</a> I can totally imagine the cat saying &quot;I DIDN&#39;T SIGN UP FOR THIS SHIT!&quot; or &quot;NO ONE TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE LOUD NOISES!!!&quot; xDDD
Damn. Now I have PASTAMANIA, Brother!
that poor guy, I hope he&#39;s alright.  severe testicular trauma can be dangerous and have life long complications/ acute pain.   fuck that would suck
&quot;The ring&quot; first movie, almost at the end when samurah was set free shortly afterwards the mother arrives home to find her son sleeping on the floor, and I noticed when she picked him up a shadow of a person in the dark room behind them. No one noticed it but me.

more likely than not the guy was teaching the dog to swim. i have thought quite a few that way. they were always terrified of the water until I did that, and afterwards every single one couldn&#39;t stay out of the water.
lol .. sounds to me like the guy throwing the can in Being John Malcovich is saying &#39;hey Malcovich take that&#39;.
The vid starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU">0:00</a> btw...

There  was a Hulkamania  pasta place.? dang how did I missed  that?

You forgot the hippies walking through the hotel lobby in Godfather I.

lol why didn&#39;t they redo any of the shots XD
Lots of dog owners play with their dogs.... Maybe the dog loved being thrown into the water by his owner!!
that shooting star in the background of jaws? ANYONE?
Johnny Depp is a great actor. The lines written for him for the movie &#39;Pirates of the Caribbean&#39; were very well done. However, it is sad to note that Depp is going through a very difficult period with a divorce in play - from his second wife. So, I am not sure that this is the best time to comment. It is hard when a marriage ends, when a second marriage ends, it can be extremely difficult to cope. Pain and unhappiness are the experiences of all of us, they can be very deep and very hard to deal with. I hope that Johnny Depp goes back to the silver screen. His is excellent as Jack Sparrow - even in the sequels. Words of encouragement:<br>Depp, it takes two to tango. In your first marriage, you did for her what you could. In your second, the same. Let us quickly break it down: Preparing dinner, baby-sitting your children, quality time spent with family, taking them to filming locations, going home for thanksgiving - maybe Christmas, sending birthday &amp; christmas cards, phone calls to check on parents on both sides ... I could go on forever! What about moments on the red carpet? What were they worth? And at the expensive restaurants in LA? The evenings you spent at home just because you wanted to? Child support....If I was a judge in your case for divorce, I would set you free, for ever. Good luck Johnny Depp with the future. You deserve one. Oops! Did I forget the roses, and bottles of Dom Perignon...
I came here just for the thumbnail......
&quot;Lettuce know your favorite&quot; omg :P
Prouder? smh
you forgot about the jar of dirt
They used a real cat in an explosion scene? That was never going to end well was it

Watch movies as movie
Johnny Depp likes it in the butt!
used to like Hulk before this

cannot be unseen
hmm i believe in the ben hur movie the main actor accidentally left his watch on in a scene. really out of place in a movie during ancient times.
in Austin Powers international man of mystery, there&#39;s a crew member seen in the back round of one of the scenes when Venesa is on the phone in the hotel room
i freaking LOVED ALL of the hulk hogan movies.. those were my child hood favs
that cat XD
This was soooo funny! 😂 Thanks for making my day
Stupid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=131">2:11</a> minute ad...I got bored, never saw the video.
I died when the cat freaked out
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=72">1:12</a> His real job was seasonal as a father Christmas but he got fired because his sack was damaged.
the&quot;mistakes&quot;actually surpasses..the original movie in most of the cases😎
Lel I skrwd yur mem
What, you left out the dog walking around doing a crap in Cheech and Chong Corsican Brothers?
If that samurai survived that battle, he&#39;d be given the title &quot;Ironballs&quot;
Poor kitty. Although it did look pretty freaky there.
I GOTTA JAR OF DIRT!!!
check out snakes on da plane da microwave says snakes. its wen he put da snake in da microwave I noticed that
I&#39;ve thrown my dog into water at the beach like that. My dog loves it and paddles back to me wanting me to do it again and again. I guess it is like how kids like swings. It is just fun playing with your dog. not all dogs like it but some do.
I lost it when the guy threw his dog into the sea XD
The Hobbit was filmed in New Zealand and as the camera pans to a crow of the Shire,in the top left hand corner, you can see a car go by.
Great
the dude threw his dog in the lake cuz he&#39;s too dumb to train it
poor dog I bet he died
That extra was so in character with that soldiering on attitude. Either that or that was some better than standard fake armour. I&#39;ve seen plenty of people just collapse from less.
poor cat
LMFAO poor samurai XD
Inj austin Powers 2 i think when the chair spins around and he says the power of christ compels you that was all Mike Myers because the electronics people were playing a trick on him but he stayed in character so it made the movie
That doesn&#39;t look like a cowboy hat
In breaking bad when Hank and Jessie go out to the desert to make a deal you can see a camera man outside the fence right next to the wind turbine
I got a jar of dirt
He threw the dog in the water so the dog can swim there..........
what about that mysterious person in one of the charlie chaplin movies?<br>nobody knows who that person was,it seemed liked it was using a cell phone but cell phones were not invented during the creation of that movie.there are many theories about that person<br>some people believe it was a man dressed like an old lady,some people believe she had a hearing problem and her hand was holding a hearing aid,some people believe that she/he just held a radio and she sang the lyrics,some people say it is a time traveler.none of these theories can be confirmed.
see that cat was funny but i felt bad seeing it so terrified but that dog one should have had someone arrested...
Poor dog, poor cat
Check out the stargate scene where tealc almost trips on his chains in the Ep &quot;need&quot;.
they threw the dog in the ocean cause that&#39;s how they train them to fight
the last one made me choke on my pasta help
I heard there&#39;s a Wildwest Movie with John Wayne that you can see an airplane.
nooo!! the dog and the cat!!! poor animals..
yes, I saw the strange thing. It&#39;s Johnny Depp.
Why is someone tossing their dog in the water so strange?
so when is hulk hogan gonna have a stroke?
Hulk Hogan aint getting no break.
I&#39;M a HULK&#39;sTER H&amp;H
I got a jar of dirt!!
Oh My God! Poor Doggy! :(
WTF WHAT ABOUT SCOOBY DOO!!!!!
the scene in pirates of the Caribbean where jack sparrow has a jar of dirt singing &quot;i got a jar of dirt, ive got a jar of dirt&quot; was totally not planned but they decided to film in anyway
i&#39;m here for Jack Sparrow but i&#39;m not impressed with that cowboy cameo, but instead the last samurai kick in the groin by horse was pretty something.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=126">2:06</a> that cat was scared as fuck lol
I only came here because I saw Johnny Depp. He&#39;s my babe
That&#39;s the 007 scene you chose? So, that fight scene where the camera crew were shown in the mirror was intended? Hahaha!
HAHAHAHHAHAHA THAT CAT!!!!! BWHAHAHAHHAHA
I  wanna eat at Pasta mania.
did they arrest the monster who chucked the dog in the ocean?
They actually forgot to include the shooting stars that can be seen in Jaws when they are out at sea.
everyone else is upset about the dog... i&#39;m laughing at the cat lol
Two that come to mind are the big birds in the Wizard of Oz and the cut out in Three men and a baby. I suppose everyone knows about those though.
It was actually me, i threw my dog Teddy into the sea. We allways did that, he loved to cool off there. We lived about a 15 min walk away and we often went walking with my dad along there. Teddy past away in 1999 and in 2005 my family moved to the UK. Teddy and i were on a programme called &#39;It will be alright on the night&#39; in 1998 about that very clip of us.....
Vic Morrow, baby!
t shirt.. why add spritz? flavor ! carribian. crandy. rum. 1 third. cran. .05 oz. 1 half spray. 5 ice. go for it. from USTZ.
Poor Dog..
To this day, that man&#39;s balls still ache after getting kicked in the family jewels by a horse.
it&#39;s not &quot;a&quot; motorcycle, it&#39;s a Harley Davidson Motorcycle.
lame
OMG. Cashing in on known crap or what? What about focusing on something important?
you forgot the kid ghost in three men and a baby
The horse kicking that poor extra cracked me up!! It&#39;s not so much the kick as it is how sudden it happens and the sound effects - even on the replay! XD!!
The misterious cowboy have been lost in a crack of the time-space continoum and now are lamenting over the fact that he is stuck in a world full of pirates and no revolvers at all for the rest of his life.
Bet that dude felt that kick in the bollocks for days later. LOL
If Hulk had pasta, what was Rock cookin?
did they do something about the dog being thrown, like beatin the shit out of the guy who did it?
Was that Lou Ferrigno (Hulk) trying to hit Hulk Hogan as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=145">2:25</a>??
where did you guys get the music that&#39;s in the background of this video?
lmao
Pirate Cowboy??:)))))
&quot;Remember in the early 90s when pro wrestler Hulk Hogan attempted a movie career?&quot;<br><br>He made a bunch of movies in the 90s. Pretty sure it worked. They just werent good.
The guy who threw the dog was wearing shorts, maybe the 2 of them were just going swimming &amp; the dog loved being chucked in (I&#39;ve known dogs who do) . God, I really, REALLY hope that&#39;s what that was!
That poor cat! You wouldn&#39;t get away with that sh*t now, every movie using live animals has an ASPCA/animal advocate on set to stop just such abuses. I hope she tore his arm up!
Who is this &quot;hulk hogan&quot; guy you are speaking of?
Fucking cruel treatment to animals STILL... should have let the cat go n calm down or maybe... god forbid pay extra for a more brave cat? Fucking humans...
So he threw a dog into the water. Big deal. Very unusual. -.-
Pastamania is running mild, brother.
in Troy 2004 there is a guy who is thrown off a balchony during the invasion part who have rubber sole sneakers, in Gladiator in the begining after the battle you can see a guy walk past in the background with has blue pants.
in the phantom menace ..there s a freaking looking kangaro thats keep poping up
What about the background restaurant extra copying Robert De Niro&#39;s lines and actions in &quot;King of Comedy&quot;?
I have a great blooper that I found watching True Lies that no one has ever mentioned yet.
isn&#39;t tom cruise like 4 foot tall lol
There&#39;s a scene in the big battle at the beginning of Gladiator where the romans and barbarians are clashing and you can see one of the barbarians walking through and laughing.
Aw, poor kitty...  Wonder if Spectre ever sent out a rescue mission to retrieve the cat after its owner was taken for that helicopter ride...
More for your collection: have a look at &quot;El Cid&quot; in the second entrance to Valencia scene there&#39;s a bloke in a &quot;fred hat&quot; and a waistcoat by the gate - not very arabic.<br>The opening sequence to the old BBC &quot;Robin hood&quot; series with Richard Greene has a telegraph pole in the middle (very rapid) shot.<br>(In days of old, when knights were bold, and women weren&#39;t invented,<br>they drilled a hole in a telegraph pole, and had to be contented…)
i feel sorry for the dog😂😂😂
i threw that dog in the water
i may have to shave off my hulk hogan mustach after this...
I&#39;ve seen a few people throw dogs into water. Just to get the dog to have a swim.
shown mays $1,000,000...
hulk hogan is so cringey it hurts
There&#39;s that naked guy in the cornfield in Twister. And in The Mummy when that big guy is getting attacked by scarabs, his you-know-what flops out of his pants.
I don&#39;t blame the cat.I&#39;d try to flee as well if I was trapped under some weird dudes smelly arm pit&#39;s
that cat looked like a practical special effect!
Sorry but i rather liked Hulk Hogan movies specially Mr.Nanny !
in the film the crimson pirate while the pirates r on their ship in the distance u can see a cruise ship.
&quot;Samurai&quot; was filmed in New Zealand and the extra kicked in the groin by the horse would have been a local guy.  Especially being raised in a keen rugby-playing society, NZ men are conditioned from childhood to be stoic and take such knocks &#39;like a man&#39; then just carry on like nothing happened .
AKA bloopers
i found the cat trying to escape the funniest shit in the world 💀💀💀💀💀💀
that dog throwing just got me....!<br>why would someone do that ! LOL
Is that a young Eric Bishoff at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=180">3:00</a> at the left or not!?
Who knew that Longshanks drove a Subaru.
While filming Tin Cup near Houston, Kevin Costner sliced the golf ball into the crowd next to me, hitting a man in the nuts at top speed. Kevin cursed and the man slinked away.

BORING SHIT. Looper slower than a snail as boring as 56 film screen in black n white.
I laughed so hard when that horse kicked him in the groin..
Don&#39;t make jokes. Just show us the stuff.
Owow<br><br>
I was hoping to see a random extra throwing two chihuahua like shitzu dogs off the side of a tall ship only to find its low tide and the ever encircling Krakken has been replaced by 15ft crocs. Small price to pay Beeeeatch. <br>Soo sorry.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=68">1:08</a> Great &#39;Man Getting Hit by Football&#39; sound clip!
pastamania brother!
PASTAMANIA WILL BE ALL OVER YOUR ASS, BROTHEEEEER
Just wondering, how many nerds are out there taking the time to go through movies one frame at a time to find these worthless tidbits?
halk did a tv show rip tide  in the 80  round the same time   i woked  in place called the  eba tide in   and  one  paper man  and law guy  in the same town  what the odds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=142">2:22</a> If you can remember the &#39;90&#39;s, you were NOT there.
hulkamania is now runnin mild.
Interesting mistakes.
Animal lovers freaking out over this clip = golden! Haha
This channel is so much better than Watchmojo.com.
Hulkster himself has been thrown into the ocean now :-)
Pastamainia is dry walled over with nothing there now..
I used to think the dog thing was weird, until I realized that I throw my dog in the lake and had been doing it for a while.  she swims back the 2 feet that I can toss her, and stands in front of me looking at the lake waiting for her next toss. if I don&#39;t immediately pick her up and toss her, she turns and looks disappointed at me.
looks like Richard Hammond <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=98">1:38</a>
lol the bonking stormtrooper and frantic cat are hilarious
@ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=110">1:50</a> I&#39;m a grip. They blame everything on the grips. xD
Waste of Time. W.O.T.
L.A.M.E.!
Drugs bad Hulk mmmmmkay .
Now can anyone understand why it takes so much work to make a stupid movie or video? LOL... everyone is a critic but if you take into account production value and hours into the scenes then you realize acting or movie making is not as easy as it looks. Come get some Catspit~!
How about a Dumb &amp; Dumber extra: When Lloyd is guessing which plane Mary is boarding and runs off after choosing one, he runs by a bench with people on it. One woman on the bench looks directly at the camera and smiles.
America is so ... fkn dumb.
Annoying voice.
Everyone is commenting about a dog, the cat, or the samurai and all I can think about is the movie breaking car in the background of Braveheart. xD
The dog thing was probable the owner trying to cool it down.
Looks like the Japanese armor worked..
Love it!
horse to the groin
wowee a dude in a hat thaTS So sTRaNge WoOOAH
Hulk Hogan &gt; Looper.
Hogan is such a hunk.
The munchkin hanging in the Wizard of Oz
Hogan&#39;s acting is as good as his &#39;&#39;Wresting&#39;&#39; SHIT!
I worked on the movie Mr. Nanny (BTW The working title was: &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, or was it &quot;Tough Stuff&quot; so long ago) The guy was playing with the dog, the water was shallow and they simply were having a good time. Why it made the final cut is beyond me.
damn, balls kicked by horsed!!!<br>i can&#39;t imagined it!!!
Hogan seemed very inspired by pastamania, and, no, I never believed he was 6-8 or 6-10.
Is that Eric Bishoff &quot;interviewing&quot; Hogan in front of his restaurant?
HAHAHA!
In mask of zorro, the scene right before hopkinss zorro dies, you can see an airplane in the sky
the parked car in braveheart hurts me.  it hurts me deeply.  :(
so in other words the title is pretty much saying &quot;These are movie mistakes come watch this video so we get money&quot; ?
in lord of the rings in at least one scene you can see a jet flying threw the sky
poor kitty :( ..
We had to toss our dog in a lake once... she was COVERED in sand fleas. She was going crazy trying to get them off. Guess what, it worked. She was a great swimmer, always chasing balls into the water. <br>Look at little further than what you&#39;re seeing people.
OH no, not the dog thing again. People think the dog instantly died or something...because they&#39;re dumb.
poor dog being thrown in the ocean
I wonder if the guy who got kicked by the horse got compensated?
How did Ironman know Peter was Spider-Man? In civil war movie
these people get paid millions to fuck up
in the classic western SHANE in the opening scene when Shane is riding across the field you can see a big white camper or truck in the distance
I&#39;ve thrown my dog into lakes and the ocean many times so she could get a swim and cool off....
How much coke you think Hulk Hogan used back in his heydey?
What about the perverted kid in Back to the Future 3?
Way better then watchmojo. And the dog! NO!
in the movie Holes there is a scene where a van is in the back ground, although there are not supposed to be any vans in the area.
What obout  that time there was a news report on the left and tower being hot then I get my home boy to hit the right tower
i hate people using animals as accessory for their minable movie.. instead they should use their own kid
&quot;I feel sorry for Big Bubba, brother&quot;<br><br>Brother, Big Bubba feels sorry for you now
In one episode of Swamp people the rifle R.J. picks up goes from right handed action to left handed action then back to right hand. Another was i  Vikings the one girl has a blood stain on the rightside of her mouth that goes to the left side.
I was here since like 9k
you sound like allen alda abit
You guys forgot the shooting star that passes through Roy in Jaws
That cat tho<br>He must have PTSD after that
Everyone is commenting about the damn cat, but no one cares about how the dog tossed in the ocean could of been abused???
Hulk Hogen: marketing genius
In the back of dead pool u can see a burning cross
Lawd that bastard tried to kill that dog SMDH-___-
That poor little kitty LMFAOOO
The fact that the horse kicked one of the extras tho,I&#39;m hollering LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
lol that cat was freaking the fuck out
that moment you realize the same guy directed Jackass &amp; John Malkovich. Plus he was in The Wolf of Wallstreet as the penny stock dude, Spike Jonze
I&#39;ve been on the Black Pearl from pirates of the Caribbean. It was docked in N.Y. it looks amazing in person.
meh
Was the guy okey after getting kicked by the Horse?
This channel is like WatchMojo, but wayyyyyy better.
In the wizard of oz there is a munchkin in the background hangin in a neuce
He threw a beer can at john malkovich and got a raise?
Getting kicked in the groin by a kid already hurt.... What more being kicked by a HORSE! Holy shit! haha
I had a dog that loved to be thrown into the water until he got too big.
wait hulk hogan had a pasta place
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=125">2:05</a> The sheer look of terror in the cats face is pure gold lol
Oh my god that cat killed me hahaha
poor kitty cat :(
that is how you learn a dog to swim. you just trow it in the water.
how about that one movie where the ghost boy is accidentally filmed and no one noticed until later.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo-8FwfLWiU&amp;t=47">0:47</a> Thumbs down just for using &quot;lit&quot;, which isn&#39;t a cool phrase to begin with.
15th comment:nice one
