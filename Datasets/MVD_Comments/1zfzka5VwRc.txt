Lovely 🌹
Me each time my fiance don&#39;t reply in my textes 😄❤ que passa mi amor ❤💖😄
Still sparkling wine in 2024 🎉
Some how i just felt i need to listen this song out of the blues...2024 ❤
It’s sad how far she has come from this joyful teen to now…<br><br>She is an example of why you should never put your hole in this world. For what does it profit a man to gain the world, but lose His soul???<br><br>Despite this songs lyrics this life isn’t all we’ve got. This life is just our choice for our eternity.
Is Demi sisters with Emma Hunton that goes by Davia in the TV show Good Trouble? They look so alike especially I this video.
❤
This song is beautiful ❤❤❤❤
Já não sei quantas vezes escutei essa música ❤😅

A beautiful, strong voice. She came from humble beginnings in a household without a father figure. The music industry swallowed her up with such <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zfzka5VwRc&amp;t=207">3:27</a> a disregard how it could affect her mental health. Additionally, professional talent agents that signed her probably recognized something but simply prioritized the amount of money she could derive. 😢
her voice is incredible!!😩<br>This is truly a masterpiece!❤because of ❤ 💖a u t h e n t i c v i e w s 💖is the key for fame
Yea awesome 👏
Didn’t need to come TikTok for this one.
On Sunday I called your selfon

Ese clip e maravilhoso a demy mais maravilhosa ainda a  2011
I remeber listening to this song all the time as a kid and now as an adult the lyrics give it an entirely new meaning. The vulnerability and hope that comes with falling in love with someone and trust them
This song finally makes sense to me
😍😍😍
2024 anyone else?
2024?❤
I wonder if I&#39;m the only one who misses Steven cerda
I love this song😊
Here in 2024 and still obsessed with this song 🤩🤩
2024 still listening masterpiece of demi love u since high school ❤
Alguém ouvindo em 2024?❤
Demi foi grandona em cada faixa do Unbroken ❤
Before
Uh I&#39;m watching fall in line video by christina and demi amd it&#39;s exactly what happened to me when Omar was higher up in the gang and I was like I already gave ub5 babies mo more and then he eventually got 2 more out of me and now navid wants me to birth me one. Which I would happily do to be honest and the Cambridge ones too. Tick tick tick. Slow but not for shamina. Oh I feel all this spiritual power oozing out hmmm black god stone power. They might as well pray around me lol
Aisha should just admit the truth of what shamina did to Omar 2 wife and navid wife. Its why their breasts got smaller and shamina got bigger. Same thing happen to me. Also when mine qnd Chris brown son got kidnapped and killed at 3 months the way shamina was screaming to farrouk she wants him and I was like its took me 12 months to birth this child and u filthy two sicko need to just have your own baby together and go to hell. Which they are. Thank u Allah 💓  also why it take 12 years later to have a baby if she was so desperate
2024..just miss this era😢

12 years ago, this song released. It reminds me the golden era of my youth at age of 24, the first time after my heartbreaking experience of 4 years earlier that I regained my confidence for a new love. Now I have lived with my gf for 12 years. Every time I heard “don’t wanna break your heart”, shining sunlight always comes into my mind.
I actually thought this was Ariana when I 1st heard it a few yrs back
Break
Perfect song. I love you, Demi &lt;3
This song is a classic for me and I think it will be timeless as is Demi Lovato  -  a timeless classic great voice and talent.  The heart and emotion in your voice and these lyrics has always brought chills to my skin and tears to my eyes.  You really poor your heart and soul into your music.  I love many of your songs for sure but this one is probably my very favorite.
2024 ❤

Before Demi went crazy and getting offended about aliens 🤣
I just realized this song is a blatant rip off from that song Unfriend you - Grayson chance
Essa é a música mais legalsinha dela.

Minha música favorita dela 🇧🇷🇧🇷💗💗
2023 todavía  la sigo escuchando 😊
Still breathing deeply because I lived at the same time as when Give Your Heart a Break was released, I was only 10 years old and now at 21, it still hits so hard and is eternalized inside me like Lovatic ∞🇧🇷

I have not listened to this song in so long. Wow, Demi’s voice has changed a lot. They sound like Camila Cabello here.
To the person reading this, even though I don&#39;t know you. I wish you the best of what life has to offer 🙏 🙌 😊❤
Demi Lovato is now a freak. Sad
Music across all genres was so much better years ago! Something changed around 2015 and everything just went to hell.
Yes I am well aware that someone very specific is feeling  lost unsure and realize she has a huge option to sit down directly speak freely in a relaxed mature conversation that at least will bring much healing straightforward answers but at most that Is only out person Lord and Savior Jesus knows so why am I not calling this woman out because it&#39;s more than obvious if us two can at worst work together but there something much more I do fully believe wait and see I miss you strongly glad relieved that I have blown away everyone of everybody preconceived notions personally but professionally to even record a CD with the working title killers of conformity possible a brand new group of never before seen ppl together all at once call on MBC to drop our syndrome on all.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤xxxoooxxxoo
❤❤❤❤❤❤

Never fall in love?<br>Divorced.<br>Heartbreak?
The day i first met you
These years I really thought she was coming from another planet whenever I heard this voice on the radio
♥️♾️⚜️✨
I love my baba so much. So many people before me treated him so wrong, so unjust, so evil... it breaks my heart every time we hit a moment he recoils in hesitation or reinforces himself behind his mask. I hope all people who have been burned n abused thru love find their people; we deserve compassion, understanding and space to find ourselves. Be well.
wow im so old, still love this song tho
Demi Got Very Great Vowels,  How didn&#39;t I notice about her music ???🎤🎙

Geesh I know there an anniversary of sorts approaching and guessing how some are a bit more sentimental than others I believe I have my own answers and the one that I have for this beautiful woman is I make sure to remember to kiss this time ❤

Devouve meu cano jhocha agora
🎉🎉my favourite for 2012 memories

when i was 10 my dream was to have her hair
26/09/2023 💔

Qué buenos tiempos cuando era niña y la vida no era tan mierda como ahora

Love this song<br>Demi Lovato is so beautiful
I miss those memories bro
😊❤
I worded it that way because I had to be on those for the world to feel how to change.
i miss these days bad
Demi Lovato is one Artist who proves that not all 2010s music is trash!  This decade I think is overlooked when people talk about good music.
❤❤so true sweetheart husband angel forever infinity and beyond the universe kyky kykyyyyyy kai angel and
It&#39;s a great, I like it  thanks my friend. 🎤😍
VH1 or MTV music videos raised it loud while I cleaned my room.
Demi come back to us with this kind of music THE WORLD NEEDS THIS!!🥺💜
I liked Demi with black hair more at the time but i didn’t realize how beautiful she looks with this hairstyle
I recorded a song of mine if you checked it out would mean very much for me 🖤
That music ❤
I was watching swac and remembered this song while going mad 4 channy
<b>sigh</b> I miss her.
Essa música me lembra da minha infância da escola😢😢
I only come to hear part 0.04-0.40. I don’t know why, but just like how it sounds.
about love
Oh it&#39;s her
ผ่านไปเร็วจังช่วงเวลาวัยรุ่นใช้ชีวิตตามประสามีเรื่องราวต่างๆให้รู้สึก😢😢😢😢
Malu2 mau😅❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
This song brings me back to good old memories. Who&#39;s still here with me listening to this now? This is one of my favorite songs of Demi.
The rock version she released is so much better haha
Is this song for joe??
I like this music 🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Watched  this masterpiece from YouTube 11 years Ago and come again today 17/8/2023
...achpolo. strong strong. 8889
Absolutely beautiful human.  Glad you made it😊
Poderia  ter uma opção  de achar comentários mais antigos primeiro no YouTube Kk . Acho que deve ter algum comentário de mais de 10 anos atrás meu por aqui . Lembro que  eu ouvia essa música  antigamente na Lan house kk
I love this song
Flashback old the moment when me young
How I wish i could turn back time😢 2009 2012 era❤
I hate this song. Stop playing games
OMG
LSS
Whoa, it&#39;s been 11 years already? It feels like yesterday! Here I am, walking down the memory lane of old Demi Lovato&#39;s old songs. 😍
i change my phone a couple of times but this song never leave my music player..
Soar high queen.. Now its her time🔥🔥🔥
Anyone at 2023 !
11 anos desse hino, estou me sentindo velha 😂❤
Pronaam mathaji
Nossa, essas músicas de 2010 a 2012 são perfeitas demais. Olha essa batida, essa melodia, essa voz, essa produção. Sinto falta desse tipo de qualidade.
Sería agradable que me lleguen a dedicar esta canción.
😊😊😊😅😅 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zfzka5VwRc&amp;t=216">3:36</a>
Still one of my fav song form Demi ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was peak Demi before she went woke. I want her back. I miss her.
Beautiful music  ❤️👍
What happened to u , may God bless ur soul.
Oh god I&#39;ve misunderstood this song for so long. I thought the title meant &quot;Let me break your heart&quot;. big whoops
❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I dont really know why i am tearing up or how im so numb but feeling so much at once. I believe the answer is between myself and someone who im sure she agree let us return to how we last saw the other and completely unopen our thoughts emotions about one another to the other and im willing to do this because this last answer im sure is going to be clear between us
Musica que marcou minha adolescencia.nessa epoca so tinha internacional top
Ah yes, before she became a space alien 3 spirit bugself zebrakin.

Music perfect for listen
não pesquisamos por músicas antigas, mas memórias antigas
Devo dire doltanto che Demi Lovato sarebbe stata  migliore se non fosse stata cocainomane compulsiva ,oggi la detesto come persona e come cantante farebbe meglio se si ritira dalla canzone e vada a lavorare in negozio visto che ne ha aperto uno tutto particolare .<br>Da Tambuzzo Giuseppe di Milano Lombardia Italia

this song still helps me too to pass on this difficult time after a happy relationship that ends just by him being afraid to continue...thank you DEMI!!

Man, remember when Demi Lovato was pretty and not a whacky SJW that believed in Aliens and Ghost relationships?

I’ve been through a lot of heartbreaks in the past but this recent one was different.. She was toxic, abusive, &amp; and hard to get away from. I know it’s considered “Weak” for guys to cry but I was doing a lot of that. I came back to this song cuz it really makes me feel better. It makes me forget abt everything that happened.

Eu juro que desde pequena, sempre amei essa música. Apesar de não entender o inglês na época, o clipe passava na Disney e achava lindo, o cenário, a voz da Demi e a própria Demi. Infelizmente, sinto que aquela Demi do passado, ficou por lá e agora uma mulher esquisita canta músicas no canal dela...
