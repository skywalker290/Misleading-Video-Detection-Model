Considering the fact that around 13-15 Billion trees are cut down each year, the fact that TeamTrees spent so much time into funding a way to plant 2 million trees is pretty useless.

&quot;That&#39;s the face I say when I make L&quot;
He really just said that about my fav anime
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=357">5:57</a> I swear everytime he sees an anime he doesnt know he asks if its full metal alchemist, he litterally did it in the last video I watched too.

When you realize that PewDiePie chair won&#39;t make it into rewind for a third year
Just reminding everyone he is the guy that took a shit in a shower
Pewds: Is that full metal alchemist? <br><br>People who watch mha: Never have we seen someone so high go so low.
Hypothetical, if the bro army is 9 yr olds and 19 year olds, is an 11 year old allowed to be in the bro army
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=390">6:30</a> he played a Dublin/Ireland song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=203">3:23</a> gave me a mini hart attack

So hyped for 2020 meme review
Every anime that pewds does not know: Fullmetal alchemist
it&#39;s weird listening to the unedited version of the intro...
&quot;Thats the face that I say when I make L&quot;
I’m actually very curious how they are gonna do a YouTube rewind 2020
Im from the future and, not gonna lie, Its so refreshing to see the old intro again
I wonder what YouTube rewind 2020 will have
Felix: * mistakes Toga&#39;s anime *<br>Me: Ight, imma head out 👌✌
Comments section is just people writing memes..
He said kids don&#39;t deserve phones but most of his fans are 9 year olds watching his vidstrkm phones
Pewds: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=357">5:57</a><br><br>Me a fan: umm... Excuse me, what did you say?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=356">5:56</a> does pewds not know what my hero is?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=690">11:30</a> which video is this?
So.. you’re telling me, that Swedes have car gummies and Americans have Swedish fish?
i felt sad when it went from 9 to 19 because I was nine for the 9 yr old army but now for the 19 yr olds I&#39;m 11.
i cant think of anything else to watch except PewDiePie <br>if you haven&#39;t sub <br>DO IT!<br>or PewDiePie will come to your house and make meme
@sam
Pewdiepie shown between paul brothers....cancer is surrounding him
When you hit the desk, one of your buttons is loose so it shakes down and it thinks your pressing the button<br>So there must be a loose button that toggles posts or something
2020 rewind ahold just be a 10 min long pic of poop poop emojis
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=464">7:44</a> Honestly, (With the exception of games, like it was for me when I was young), I wholeheartedly agree.

Flurgen smurgen
Cant wait for 2020
Its hard watching old pewdiepie vids and accidentally singing the new lwiay intro
Pewdiepie is the most hated and liked youtuber at the same time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=357">5:57</a> it&#39;s from my hero academia! Reeeeeeee

hey pewds idk what to do with the green sock I am confusion<br><br>also poopdog so cute
Lööp
TOGA IS FROM FMA EVERYONE
you didnt change
Hahaha they were excited for 2020
Pewdiepie chan looks like Filo from shield hero
The jurnalist infact defend Felix, the title is misleading, and titles are made by editors...<br>It&#39;s the same mistake that most people do, forming opinions on Pewds ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
damn he was talking simlish
but like why is youtube rewind even a thing <br>like why are people watching it, theyve never been  recommended to me anywhere personally <br>also whats even the point of it,  like  SOMEBODY cares if they wanted to be in it  <br>like it doesnt even make sense in a buisness perspective over time because theyre polarizing themselves  <br>its like why do they keep shooting themselves in the feet <br>if something doesnt work sometimes its better to give up on an idea than to keep holding on to it
Felix god of rhyme at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=82">1:22</a> <br>„I didn‘t think words could hear<br>You know sticks and stones <br>Don‘t break no bones <br>But this made a man tear“ <br>ABBA B*tch

DID U SAY FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST BRUH ITS MY HERO ACADEMIA
I just went back to dislike the video
6.9k likes nicee but not nice
The anime is my hero academia
sticks and stones may break my bones , but chains and whips excite me  .
I understand that Congratulations violated the harrassment policy, but the fact that they took out a video of the list is kinda dumb because they ignored things that violated their &quot;kid friendly&quot; policy when they have an entirely different app for &quot;kid friendly&quot; content.

Pewds: “What anime is that from? Full Metal Alchemist?”<br><br>Weebs: He has cross over into the bad lands
the banana is clearly a money laundering scheme
I disagree that we will be roped in with the idiots in the future, thanks to our documentation of people criticising their bullshit. History won&#39;t repeat itself. If anything it will make the idiots look worse when there are people going against them.
I can’t wait for the rewind of 2020...

When pewdiepie first announced his chair, I was like &quot;nah, why would I want pewdiepie branded chair&quot;. But now the memes have made it slightly desirable even with the 399 price tag. But alas I will never have that money for such frivolous meme chair.

There&#39;s a lot more my hero academia comments in here then there should be lmao<br><br>Like i get it, u&#39;re offended about ur anime, but all you have to do is correct him lmao its not funny
YouTube deleted a gmail of mine I&#39;ve never used for email for &#39;grievous breach&#39; taking out 10 12+ year old YouTube Partner and Brand accounts with 4-5M views all because I hold the wrong political views and am a centrist. After a year of monetization appeal tennis they just yeeted all of them out of the blue. No word on what I did that was a breach, but I hadn&#39;t posted in ages so god knows. YouTube are evil, absolutely evil. I can&#39;t raise attention to it because my 60k Twitter account lost it&#39;s tick in 2016 and suddenly went from rapid climb and 10-20% interaction to decline and 0% interaction and became invisible in my country. I have no doubt I am one of many. I often wonder how many people tech tyrants have destroyed by now. How many have taken themselves out from the constant barrage of deplatforming and silencing and digital de-personing? I reckon the tech companies would be responsible for tens of thousands of suicides, if not hundreds of thousands, by now. Ruining so many home grown businesses, destroying so many lives, all because what? They aren&#39;t communists and they said something spicy like there are two genders?
The ferrari bilar are some good shit tho!🤤
What&#39;s that anime from?! You&#39;ve watched fullmetal but not bhna?
Did my dumbass  just scroll on the screen like I was on redit
mmm bilar

In retrospect, you may be the most hated youtuber because you are the most well-known youtuber. Therefore you are more liable to have more haters than others.

I know my comment is long, but this is so fucked up what TY is doing to Pewds.<br> Pewds and the 19 Year Olds are so happy about The Pewds Chair making it into YTRewind for 2 years in a row, but he literally hosted/was the main part of YT Rewind 2014. <br>And if you search - not click on, just search in YT search box -  “YouTube Rewind” all of the years come up EXCEPT for “YouTube Rewind 2014” which is the one Pewds hosted like I said! Try it, Type in “YouTube Rewind”, look at the auto complete results, and tell me if 2014 is not there or really low/last. 2014 like it is on my phone and laptop. <br>Wtf. They’re trying to fuckin pretend like he doesn’t exist!

Can we make this the most liked comment.<br>Like Below👇👇👇👇👇👇
Love from india
Congratulations should have been in rewind because little kids don&#39;t know what rewind is. When I discovered it, I think it was 2017.. and I&#39;m 12 rn.
The anime is my hero academia which actually is a really good anime that has come out over the past years.... it has this same stereotype mc that wants to be the best in the profession that is being a hero and stumbles upon many obstacles kinda like naruto but in a different way
What&#39;s The second requiremennntttttt?????
wait.... King of Arendelle = King of YouTube = Pewdiepie...?????
I love yiay
677k likes, we’re waiting for that correction bro
Fullmetal alchemist ??!! <br>Really 😑??<br>This is very disappointing :&quot;(
Minecraft
I didn&#39;t even get rewind recommended... So I did not see it. The first thing I watch about it is this video 😂
&quot;сука блять&quot; мерч топовый
MY NAME IS ..........
i paused it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=509">8:29</a> accidentally and sat there for a full minute assuming it was a joke or something until i realised i paused it
Omg I&#39;m finally a 19, 19 year old not a 9, 19 year old ☠
If i am reacting to PewDiePie right now how many reactions is it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=626">10:26</a> in the video?
Damn i love pewdiepie. Id probably take a bullet for him even though he doesn&#39;t know me hahaha....
I wonder if there is a corporation making a platform that will be better than youtube
I love the word Moron to describe the current political climate.
Dude people for the last time the decade doesnt end this year it ends in 2021
When is our rewind comming?
damn the song... It&#39;s sooooooooooooooooooooooooo catchy..
Love how he still has ads on his vids.<br>YoUTubE yOu&#39;Re UgLy

Felix: I don&#39;t know which anime this is from, is it from fullmetal alchemist?<br><br>Me: <b>Waifu time stops</b>
I love how pewds just rips on YouTube this entire video
You look better with your beard
Is he drunk?<br><br>I like him.
I&#39;m just gonna go ahead and say it, I&#39;d definitely put my pp in Pewdiepie Chan.
Pewdiepie: confuses my hero academia character with a full metal alchemist character.<br><br><br>My hero academia character: Am I a JoKe To YoU?
Can the next CEO be such a GenZ and actually watch videos on youtube and likes gaming
According to a movie called midsommar you can speak Swedish by getting high
Anime is my hero academia and that’s himogo yoga or however you spell it
I was almost mad when he called a hero aka character from fullmetal alchemist of all things... but it doesn’t matter anyway, and he is unlearned in the ways of us basement dwellers

Pew is a republican and doesn’t even know it. Love him for that. Not like there’s much choice when dems want to silence everything and make everything pc.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRJGRyg3dw&amp;t=355">5:55</a> All the My Hero Academia nerds started crying at once
&quot;the great depression&quot; yo that hit hard XD
So... any suggestions for a new video platform where creator can actually be themselves?
Whenbthe biggest channel on the pkatform trash talks youtube.
Pewdiepie saying kids don&#39;t deserve phone is the equivalent of thanos snapping
