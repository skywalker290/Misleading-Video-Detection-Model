Listening From 1 year Best Song..♥️🥺
Almost 4 years of Ajnabee, still my fav 🫶🏻
Luckily this sing is underrated❤️❤️❤️<br>Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
I&#39;m through the worst phase of my life, failing in almost all aspects. Thanks for this song ❤
Even after 3 years, this is in my most favourite list❤
Such an underrated gem ❤❤
The lyrics are so deep and the music is no calm love you bhuvan sir❤
This song reminds me  memories of &quot;MY LOVE ❤&quot;. Most of the scenes of this song mesmerize me about togetherness. Especially stairs Masti, Moving chair, watching movies, (getting ready for that person) , cracking jokes , holding hands .... ❤😊 That was a special ERA for me which get demolished after several years 😕. It still brings tears in my eyes by thinking that why it does not last long.... I just accepted all things as &quot;It&#39;s God&#39;s will&quot; and somewhere &quot;Yaad aaye to mil hi jaunga tujhko yahin<br>Na bhi aaye to samajh jaunga<br>Thi mujhmein hi kuchh kami&quot;....  🙂
This is the most underrated song yaarrrr what a depth in the lyrics ❤Really salute you mannn❤Hope This Song Gets Much More Attention ❤😊<br>Love you a Lot BB ❤
Anyone in 2023👇👇
Listener bi OG hai ❤

Once i listened to this song for fun but now i am crying while listening to this because i now know how much it hurts when you love someone and they are yours but you know that they are never gonna be yours. Deep isn&#39;t it just read it again.
Thugesh k sath interview k meme me sunkar aaye😁
start music- akhon onek raat by anupam roy
After chatting hours and hours after three months she blocked me and ghosted this song feels like just just mine situation<br>Yad aye to mil jaunga tujhko yhai aur na bhi aye to <br>Smajhjaunha ki mujh me hu thi kami...
It&#39;s 3:00Am + this masterpiece song ❤ + tears in eyes + goosebumps = best feeling in the world 💯❤
I have no words bhuvan🤎
Nice one 👌
A sweetest memory might end in a painful song
Lyrics are wonderful
BB is so talented
Where has this PURE LOVE gone from today&#39;s society 🥹🥲
Kuch nahi bhai galti se yalgaar sun liya tha...paap dhonee aaya hu
This song is just like a hidden gem, I will preserve this.😭
❤❤❤❤❤I don&#39;t what to say sir. I just want to request to keep continue your you tube channel even when you become very big star. Although you are now to a big star..........
Starting guitar tone was copied from bangoli song Akhon onek raat....
I know you probably wouldn’t remember me, in 2016, I had texted you on Instagram! I asked you to sing ‘kuch toh hai&#39; Song cover and you replied by saying &#39;sure will try&#39; I was a fan of your work back then and I am even now! Keep growing✨keep glowing✨
Usual I don&#39;t say this much but this song is literally masterpiece
BB op ❤️

💖Yaad aaye toh mil hi jayunga tujhko yaheen<br>Naa bhi aaye toh samajh jayunga thi mujhme kuch kaami 💖<br><br>Purest form of love where he does not even blame the girl for forgetting him.<br>Rather he blames himself maybe he has some flaws...
💔
There was a time when your relationship was meant to remain till heaven. But, now you two became ajnabees to each other and deep down that hurts.
This is the song every time I feel something that I can&#39;t explain but  it&#39;s 🥺💔
Masterpiece with harsh reality

How the fuck I didn&#39;t press the like button
The moment when the girl had to remove her accessories that made her look cool and vibrant (both at young and old age😢) They literally made us realize how a girl can be her true self only around her loved ones  ❤️❤️❤️ this made me smile and cry at the same time ;(

My favorite song ever
Meaning is awesome<br>Amazing bb that is peace
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dx9Qjod0s0&amp;t=136">2:16</a>  .... Best
Two years ago, when this single was first released, I didn&#39;t understand what it meant. It was all so confusing and bizzare. The video made no sense at all. <br><br>Today, I felt every damn second of it. Yaad aaye toh mil hi jaunga yahi.  &lt;3
Bhuvan is multi talented lovely song 😍😘😘
This man is a real legend bro! i just love him! Every thursday I eagerly wait for DHINDHORA!! Thank you BB for making us smile!

Most people know the humorous side BB but not this passionate, emotional, deep meaning and impressively artistic side
When bb said- Yaad na aaye to....samj jauga mujmehi thi koi kami ..I felt that. The whole song is so meaningful
After listen this song singles also felt that they have a girlfriend 🔥🔥❤️
I hadn&#39;t known this guy before,  just came to know when one of my friend called me BB. 😆
Bhai mad angles koh ban krao koi

Mera subha shuru hota hai with BB,Atif and Arijit ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So so nice thank you making this amazing video
Lovely❤
33k dislikes are from Tony Kakkar&#39;s Fan
Other youtubers ek side..bb is just on diff level
Iss geet ka Arijit version bhi nikaliye bhuvan sir!!
Trust me or not,<br>BB believes in true love, but incomplete. Uska manna hai that true love is always left incomplete, and love is painful. True love does not fade away with passing time, but it is always adhura.<br>Listen to the words carefully -- &quot;Humdardi wale hi aksar dard de jaate hai.&quot;<br>&quot;Pyaar bawaseer ki tarah hota hai, ekbar hota hai lekin dard bahut deta hai&quot;.<br>In Sang Hoon Tere at the end, Bhuvan dies and the girl recalls Bhuvan by watching their old recorded videos and those pics, behind which was written &#39;Sang Hoon Tere, now and forever&#39;.<br>Love never dies. Just that stories are left incomplete, giving us pain.<br>😢😢
❤️❤️
Aanson aa gye 😭😭

Longs hairs in old age bhuvan bhai🙂
Deepest condolences on the loss of your parents. I have kept this song on YouTube Repeater for the longest time. Yes, your multi persona one handed phone acts are cool, and they give people the light hearted bursts to get away from the daily bhasad. But music is where your talent shines through. You should really do more of this.
Ab kia bolu sab to sunlia 😭😭
BB lost his parents 😭😭 💔💔 I am really sad 😢😣😢😫😞 but it&#39;s ok aap piche mat hato aapke fans and aapke subscribers aapke sath hai aap famous youtuber ho aur sab aapko chate hai keep growing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
GAJAB🔥🔥🔥
you are the best artist ever❤️ love from Pakistan
I miss my ex🥺 this song line hits different 😭
Bhai Bhuvan Bam Main Chahta Hun Ki Tum gana Gao theek hai Achcha Nahin Bata bhai Kuchh aur banaa dete seriously bahut Achcha Lagta Tumhara
Yaad aye toh ..mil hi jauga tujko yahi .naa bhi aye toh ..smj jauga

My best friend left me. I was so attached but it was so easy for her to say &#39;&#39;i dont care anymore&quot;.<br>This is so relatable.❤💔
Beautiful.
Did you see subscribe is more than views 😂😂
One of the best song ... I have ever tune .. ❤️ ..   BB you are a legend ❤️
Kaha milega vai accha alu
The best song really bhai kuch Kami nahi thi
Wtf i just realized that the girl was apoorva arora🙆🤦
I don&#39;t know why this song has so less views
This song has a deep meaning 🙂
I have goosebumps this song is so beautiful 🥺✨ the music video &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;❤️
❤️😀
The story of two neighbours who loved each other in their youth but couldn&#39;t be together for some family reasons(typical Indian society). The girl ends up getting married to someone else. I am assuming the guy is still unmarried till this time as there is no relative who is living with him and there is some emptiness in his eyes which is also shown in the younger version also when he is missing her.<br>The guy waits for her return she comes to his parental home, they recreate their loving moments everytime, try to live every second of it and at the end they both have to wake up from their dream world which is so painful for both of them and you can again see the emptiness in the eyes of the man who will again wait for those moments for which he lives, for which he has given his whole life.<br>I have lost count of how many times I have watched this song. <br><br>Bhuvan Bam, you are a true musician ♥️. This song is right up there in my top list of songs to listen. Specially the story which has been told so beautifully in just 3 minutes blows your mind. Keep making such music man. Lots of love ♥️😊
Can somebody please explain why tf is this so fn underrated?
Most sad and lovely song forever 💓💓
This guy can beat the whole music industry ❤️🙂
Yeh gaana kitna pyara hai😍😍
Bingo chips is best

i like the attitude of bb , giving credits to all of his fellow actors and then giving credit to himself , or else i have seen many stars , forgetting that it is not only them , but also the other actors who perform with them as well . <br>But yeah , Dhindora is coming soon , i am very excited for that .
I&#39;m very curious about the story behind this🤔
I don&#39;t think carryminati deserves more than him
Close to my heart<br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>❤❤❤💓💞💕💝💖

While listening this song I asked my girl that, &quot;This won&#39;t happen with us right?&quot; and she promised, &quot;It won&#39;t happen DW&quot; and now she&#39;s asking for Breakup. We&#39;ve been together for 7 and half years. I can&#39;t give up on her. I can&#39;t become Ajnabee to her.
bhuvan&#39;s songs are the best but dont know why still underated,his songs is more valueable than Tony kakkar&#39;s entire carrier !
