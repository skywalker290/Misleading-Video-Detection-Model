So these people actually destroyed a lycan hypersport??
tf??????? walker was diedddd
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHOxlNZd3mM&amp;t=44">0:44</a>
It&#39;s so silly that so many people in here think they used an actual Lykan HyperSport to just crash.. Even if you had the money and wanted to do it, most hypercars manufacturers wouldn&#39;t sell it to you for it to be destroyed. The same company that built the Lykan, W Motors, also built 10 copies with a fiberglass shell as opposed to carbon fiber, Porsche Boxster/Cayman engine and stretch chassis with no interior infotainment or any other features. All of the interior was CGI. Each car probably cost the studio at most $60,000 + 10 = $600,000.  <br><br>YouTube comment sections remind me just how daft humans can be. It&#39;s incredible.
Familyyyy
nice
que Película tan tonta van a llegar a la 20 con la misma idiotez
cool
Rip Paul WALKER😢
Nice shoot computers
I don’t know why I didn’t realize Paul and vin had stunt guy’s. It’s actually kinda disappointing, and neither of the stunt guy look like them lol at all
Paul walker semoga khusnul khotimah, amiin
Rip Paul Walker . Why they destroy this lykan ;-;
Miss you paul 😭
R.i.p al auto
Btw can someone tell me that which scene was pauls last scene in fast and furious 7?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHOxlNZd3mM&amp;t=38">0:38</a> wait a minute... Paul Walker was alive when filming this scene? Was it his last appearance before dying?
I cant believe they really throw a car 😮
Paul Walker..<br>no caption needed for this name
Rip poul waker
speed shooting how can camera man hold camera and record 😜😀😀😀
Making a movie is really hard🤦💯
😂
I think we should respect more stunt double man more than these actor&#39;s
Your right you dont never say no and now you got some of the most ridiculous action sequences. James bond gives great action sequences without looking untouch with reality
⚽⚽🚛🚛🎮

Really James van nailed it as a director....hats off to him!!
Paul walker isn&#39;t dead he is waiting us to finish the line
Respect for Paul Walker 🚓

👍👍
how much have this cost
Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn&#39;t have an investment and I will tell you how soon he&#39;ll go broke. Investment is building a safe haven for the future: with the right choice of investment that has at least 1% minimum risk and with an Expert guidance, profit and interest should be 💯 guaranteed.
Mobilnya bagus banget tapi sayang😥

Poor car<br>Rip car

So they made the stunt guys actually jump out of the car only to then cut up the sequence so you can&#39;t actually tell it was real?? This is just like that time Tom Cruise did real skydiving only for them to add cgi clouds making it look fake.
Poor car

<b>Fantastic video 📉😎Looking at the bullish moves top crypto assets has been having since last year, I&#39;d call it a very big win for hodlers of btc.</b> <b>Though 2021 is set for much bigger gains as predicted by analysts,</b> personally holding is still a very odd way of making gains which isn&#39;t really my thing, considering the Dynamics and low bucks one gains within the time. I prefer trading assets which has provided me a far bigger pay gain than I initially imagined, although am still far from being an expert trader. Trading is serious business that is both technical and demanding, major reason I just employ the use of signals from trade expert Jayson Brian, I will admit his signals and trade guide has been top notch and core to my trading successes, trading experience and good mastery of the market really sets him apart from other pro trader.

wow
...and it&#39;s dude-bro crap.
I dont think insurance wants to cover the set. How many super cars have they destroyed?
Good old days when CGI is only used to improve practical effects ! Now everything just piece of shit CGI ! Especially fucking marvel !
unnötig
They said every detail In the movie, but they didn&#39;t even tell how Vin Diese manual shifted a supercar with paddle shifters.
Wow all those cars and yet they still made a shitty ass movie

Dafuck did they actually use real cars?
Dom, cars don&#39;t fly.<br>CARS DON&#39;T FLYYY.!!!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQDkX3rDmE">https://youtu.be/-RQDkX3rDmE</a>
They filmed it in real life. But in the movie it looks like CGI with all those color grades and added VFX. So in the end they could have done it full CG. The result is not as impressive as the making of.
Fast and Furious 1 , Fast and Furious 2, Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift , Shit and Shitious 4-9 ...

I’m so happy, i never believe i will be this happy again in life, I was working as an air-hoster ( cabby crew ) for 3years but early this year, i loose my job because of this deadly disease called Herpes virus (HSV), I never felt sick or have any symptom, till all workers were ask to bring their doctors report, that was how i got tested and i found out that am HSV positive that make me loose my job, because it was consider as an STD and is incurable disease, i was so depress was thinking of committing suicide, till i explain to a friend of mine, who always said to me a problem share is a problem solved, that was how she directed me to Dr Scott, that was how i contacted him and get the medication from this doctor and i got cured for real, I just went back to my work and they also carry out the test to be real sure and i was negative. Please contact this doctor if you are herpes positive,hiv/aids,cancer,coronavirus or any STD diseases his email is: Dr.Scottwitcher21@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>. You can also text ::: +1 339-201-9132

Why they got to kill a nice ass car
Paul walker character one of the best❤️<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rip">#RIP</a>😥
Why is love according to the method of the &quot;baal hasulam&quot; The wisdom of Kabbalah,  is the solution to all troubles for humanity?<br>Because all nature is a force, a feature, a system, a formula of love.<br> Of connection and unity between opposites, between hot and cold, hard to soft, white and black, male and female, sweet and bitter, light and dark.<br><br>In every atom and particle, in every inanimate plant and life, the whole universe and beyond, the whole reality is the result of a connection between opposites.<br><br>For humanity and the individual, one power rules from the day of birth, hatred of others and self-love at its expense, egoism.<br><br>By combining the power of love with the equation, man maintains the connection between the opposites and thus stops resisting nature, and enters into harmony with it, which is the goal of nature, to do good to creatures.<br><br>Until then, man will suffer great and immense suffering in order to recognize and submit to the demand of nature,<br>He must strive in his power and choice in loving others.<br>Thus he will acquire intellect and wisdom to connect the two opposites and will complete the nature that was created with unintentional intent, but rather man must complete it, and manage it, and bring it to perfection.<br><br>And why did nature do that?<br>(Nature and God are the same gematria 86)<br><br>In order for man to grow and develop in his free choice and thus conduct creation as the conductor of an orchestra,<br><br> And if man had been created in advance corrected and perfected?<br><br>So he was like a perfect animal, dog and cat. But their rank as a robot is controlled with no free choice but absolute instinct dominates them.<br><br> After all, a real benefit from a father to his son is nothing but that the son rises and grows according to the rank of his father and even above him. We were to conquer nature just like the one who created it. And not when judging and living a dog and a cat.<br><br>If so the solution<br>Is not in increasing the hatred from which it is not lacking and will never be lacking because that is how it has been imprinted on us from the day of birth<br>(Media you do a very bad job just a pity a lot of beatings along the way !!!!)<br><br>Nor in the abolition of hatred because it is power is in nature and should not be abolished.<br><br>But only in the addition of love and connection and oneness addition upon addition while being aware of the process.<br><br>The people of Israel will wake up !!! Followed by the whole world !!!!!<br><br>Nature (G-d) requires connection and oneness and if not, he has every means to educate man and humanity until his surrender.<br> He will not rest or sleep until the purpose of creation is completed.<br>To do good to creatures.<br>Come, O Bnei Yisrael, you are the first to realize this study !!!!!!!!<br>And when you know, you will teach your brothers the peoples of the world.<br><br>This is called light to the Gentiles.<br> And this is a job we do not deserve at all in the meantime.<br><br>&quot;For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples!&quot;<br><br>Love friends only love. It is the solution for every individual and for everyone together.<br><br>how?<br> To do propaganda of connection and not of separation and hatred ...
so they break 3 lykans , really?????
