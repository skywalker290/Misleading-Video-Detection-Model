An honest review finally.. Yes samsung didnt work enough on this shitty phone..they just wanted to be the first ones to launch a fold. Its trash actually. My screen is black since  10 months. Also its not handy for typing or dialing.. Anything
It‚Äôs 2024 now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=534">8:54</a>
I bought a Galaxy Z 3 got a small hard object between the closed lids and ruined it. The second unit at about 9 months had the screen saver delaminate talked to Samsung, no problem gave me a shipping label shipped from Alberta to Ontario, Samsung sent an email stating phone warrantee had expired, I purchased the phone well under a year before, the then said it would cost $68.00 to repair and get it back to me. They also said I had 30 days to pay or they would dispose of the Phone. well fine I paid now 6 months latter and the screen is once again delaminating, I called on the issue and Samsung again said not thier problem and I would have to pay again. MY WORDS OF WISDOM STAY AWAY FROM FLIP PHONES AND I AM DONE PURCHASING SAMSUNG PRODUCTS&lt;THE COMPANY IS NOT HONORING THIER OWN PRODUCT&gt; GARBAGE COMPANY BS.
I&#39;m now looking to buy one so ow I&#39;m skeptical
This was 4 years ago?! I got a Galaxy fold a year ago. No warning about the screen protector. Yeah, removed mine and that&#39;s when the problems started. God a bulge in the middle of the screen which looked like a small ink drop, then two white lines running across half of the screen.  Now the fold screen is totally black. Really mad...
4 years later and this still happens on new models? Tech ? Ok geesh üòÇ
The phone fault is just this. Too bad Because it is a good phone.
I just had mine repair at a local Asurion repair shop called uBreakiFix by Asurion. It was free of charge, being the phone is still under the manufacturer&#39;s warranty. I will not be opening it much anymore.
4 years later and the same issues, smh
When i first saw this i thought, damn folding phones arent gonna be good for a long time, for the last year and a half though ive been loving my fold 4
Damn
Hey guys, happy new year to you all. <br><br>My Samsung fold 5g, (Left half) of the inner screen light went off, I means exact half of it, while the right light of the inner screen is on wen open the screen, but the whole full screen still torching, I have to be rotating it round to enable me see what am doin on the screen.. Please someone should please advice me on what to do. does this need for me to change the inner screen completely??? I feel lik since it&#39;s the back half light that went off, could it be something else from the panel? won&#39;t it be the same if i change the whole inner screen?. Rgd Engr Segun
4 years later and they still broke.
What the fuck<br>&quot;Can&#39;twait till it&#39;s 2023 and say folding phones are getting really good~MKBHD&quot;<br>Giga chad music kicks in &gt; one plus open flexing muscles, Fold 5 bom bom bom bom.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=538">8:58</a> welcome to the OnePlus Open!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=543">9:03</a> YOO it happened
I have myself a Samsung Z Fold 4, bought it a year ago and I wanna mention I took very good care of it. Very good!!! I also rarely used the big screen in order to protect it as much as possible. Recently, while I was in vacation I saw the protection cover start to lift it up from the upper side, in the middle(where it folds) and I said OK... I won&#39;t try to remove it or something, I ll let it like this until I ll change it. Well...i open it few times to take pics and I heard a noise like weird...when I open it the phone to see.... Surprise! The screen got a black like  and the touch wasn&#39;t working anymore.....üôÑ<br>Apparently the cover protection that did lift in that time place, it somehow press on the screen or I dunno and crack it. I took it to Samsung and they said they need to incestigate to make sure I wasnt the one who actually broke it. The phone looks like new so... They saw it and understand it and I didn&#39;t pay anything for it. But If I had to....pffff... Also paying for something I know wasn&#39;t  my fault. My luck was also that it was still under the guarantee. <br>My advice :don&#39;t buy a fold /flip phone.<br>2. In case you already did it and you ll ever see your protection lifts a bit, immediately go and replace it! And don&#39;t use that screen until you don&#39;t replace it. Please choose a service and that is authorized by Samsung cause if anyone else will do it and they broke the screen, which is very likely, cause it s so so sensitive, you ll have nothing to do, but eventually to pay it from your pocket the replacement of the screen.
By the way this was never  put in the frozen whether 35 degrees I believe the cold may break the inside üò¢üò¢
That happened today my phone have a black line on the LCD sceenüò¢üò¢üò¢ for no reason and I call they told me to buy another phone üò¢üò¢üò¢
Why would they make it so easy to remove in the first place insted of fixing it under the frame, now who builds that &amp; what engineer builds it with out thinking in to the future
Dude really said 2023 as the year where folding phones would be really good and they are now, Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5 are crazy good
You should not remove the protector and you broke it. You can feel the protector well glued and you use lot of force just to removed it. You broke it that is.
Galaxy z folds are useless‚Ä¶ bought z fold 4 and with in 7 months inner displays topped working. Won‚Äôt buy again..
My protective screen started coming off in the fold area of z3 in the 11th  month.  Had to  pay to have it replaced. 10 months later, same again, and samsung  wanted me to pay again. I have removed the protector and fingers crossed, still working.  This is a design fault, and I am not happy with Samsung&#39;s non help.
Hahaha watching in 2023 makes this awesome
Watching this in 2023 üíÄ
You  were right! foldable phones from Samsung are much better in 2023
Mine too
I&#39;m not gonna buy phone from Samsung again..!
Anything that folds, eventually is gonna  snap off.
my fold 3 just broke randomly just outside of warranty, great.
Hey its 2023. üòÇ Folds have indeed came a long way.
Cool idea of Samsung
My fold4 just had this issue, layer came away itself after 11 months. As soon as this layer came away the inside screen died. Will never get a fold again.
Crazy in 2023 you really say that in 1 of your videos.
End of september 2023, inside screen for Fold4 is a big improvement. It looks like it is removed from the Fold 5. Completely silent hindge, much better crease, better quality image. It was fixed under warranty.
you were right. in 2023 folding phones are good!
Thank you for sharing, I regret I made the order for this Z Fold. For mine, it broke in the inner line. I have never peeled the screen protector and never dropped this phone, I wish Samsung would need to stop selling this model. Sent for a repair and cost for $499.
Samsung and iPhone are most problematic most poor quality smartphones
hello .. my fold 3 samsung is already not working the big screen is already black.. i used it only for 1year and 7 months
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=545">9:05</a> They&#39;re now just about usable without having the fear of it being a dust magnet lol
24hrs into having my fold 5, a bright white line of pixels showed up in top right corner and it is slowly growing in thicknes. I am extremely furious,  I have never had a phone issue like this. I miss my NOTES!
2023 - Hey folding phones are getting really good!
Can I get that fixed if I have insurance?
They&#39;ve gotten good
I have a Fold 4 and in less than a year of executive use, the screen sank and crashed (confirmed by Samsung&#39;s service). We were scammed.
I have the fold 4 and have the bump under my screen. What do I do? It hasn&#39;t gone out yet but has a small black line at the bump where the screen is now damaged under neath
2023.  Samsung released the same phone again
I&#39;ve used one of these daily for 3 years now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=553">9:13</a> Now, it&#39;s 2023 and you can confidently say that.
Just came back after your Z5 review, and welp your conclusion wasn&#39;t true.
Why not upload your video where you screen die? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=125">2:05</a>
So<br>2023..<br>Fold 5 is out..<br>What would you say?!
2023....  4TH GEN AND 5TH ABOUT TO COME......<br><br>THEY&#39;RE STILL BRAKING
galaxy fold was 4 years ago?
I removed it from my fold 3 no issues like this
2023 here, and you were right! üòÅ
I bought my Z Fold3 Oct. 2022, and it still in good condition despite of removing the plastic cover after 1 year I bought the phone. I&#39;ve been using my Fold3 for almost 2 years now. I just always give extra care to it because the phone itself is not cheap!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=542">9:02</a> yup they&#39;re good in 2023 üòÇ
I remember watching this 4 years ago, it&#39;s great where foldable phones are now!
My fold 3 just got a huge black line down the centre flipped screen stopedtouch input, today full black screen can only use the front s reen folded up, seriously dissapointing for a so called high end product
&quot;But that&#39;s the thing, I still can&#39;t wait to genuinely say, like in a future video in some, like, 2023 video where I can say &#39;Hey, folding phones are getting really good!&#39;&quot; -MKBHD 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=537">8:57</a>
Crazy price for sure. Samsung had exposing phones and now this smh. Hopefully they come up with a solid one in the future
His youtube channel is cool
I feel really sad for only two days my samsung fold got broken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=566">9:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=569">9:29</a>
Let me say this.  My z4fold got bubbles under the screen protector.  Where the fold is.  I called Verizon.  They told me to remove the screen protector.  It easily came off with no problem.  Bubbles gone and phone works fine.
So I purchased the Z fold 3 just under a year ago, last week it developed the &quot;Black line of Death&quot;. <br>Why isn&#39;t there more discussion about this which is a massive design flaw in this model which should be highlighted resulting in a recall?<br>On purchase the instructions and guidance state not to remove the inner screen protector BUT over time the material used becomes brittle and starts damaging the inner screen when pressed resulting in bubbling and eventual screen damage. The inner right-hand screen then ceases to respond to touch. This is a known issue that isn&#39;t but should be discussed and highlighted to protect potential buyers.
No warning in mine a year ago.  I left mine alone until recently when it got dirt underneath.  Now it&#39;s ruined.  Front screen also.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=537">8:57</a> So... are folding phones getting really good?
My Galaxy z Fold 2&#39;s screen protector started to bubble about a month ago. Now the screen is black.
Well the new folds are rlly good
Watching this on a fold 4! üòÉüëç
Do NOT buy this phone.  They are all defective.  I have had my phone for just over a year and the inner screen no longer responds.  My co workers all have the same problem, some less than a year.  Samsung will not do anything about it as it is out of warranty.  But these are all defective from the start.   Its BS that they tested these for 200,000 folds!  Sure all in a lab and probably highly exaggerated.   DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!
Dont ever use that phones
It&#39;s 2023. And Folding Phones ARE getting pretty Good
The reason is simple, In march, they sent an update that caused problems in tablet mode. This is so easy. There is nothing more to do here that is just close to your phone and power off and back on. That is the fix. Do your update with the phone closed. I followed all these directions 5 times, and each time, I had to go to verizon. They fixed it and I came home. By accident today, I found the answer. I closed the phone because I was about to throw it and as soon as it closed the word phablet hit me between the eyes. I left the phone closed and powered off and back on as perfect as can be. Thank you for your video because yours was the only one on here that actually addresses something. Verizon said it is great you have insurance. I wanted to whack him because a $300 copay is not something to celebrate. However, for this one just close the phone.
I can‚Äôt see a glass screen that folds so it probably has to be a plastic screen.The screen on the fold one which I had the screen was dreadful to touch and resolution.The fold 3-4 are a complete different screen much improved.
The top and bottom of mine is sarting to peel and guess what i very rarely open it. What bs samsung
Thats ,fing cool i see mine peeling on the top and bottom it looks like a protector buts not good to know i will be sending it back. Mine has a small buldge very very small. What a load of crap it needs to be recalled period.what a crooked company
My fold 4 has dead pixels too. At the bottom of the screen and samsng doesn&#39;t do enough to make me feel comfortable spending $2000 for a phone that breaks after only 3 months
I will NEVER buy a samsung fold again!!!  My fold 3 (never dropped) main screen  got a black line down the middle one monthe after warrenty expired (70% use was done on front screen).  They didn&#39;t give a sh_t!!!
2023 and folding phones ARE getting really good. ‚ù§
This video is on my home page after my 3 months old Fold 4 inner screen just diedüòÇ. What a coincidence
i have the fold 4 and i am not really crazy about it i am going to trade mine in for the 23 ultra  not going to take any chances with the screen
I don&#39;t see how people need an explanation for a plastic screen breaking
Watching this video in 2023 üòÖ
Rule of thumb. If there is no tab, don&#39;t remove it. Shipping protectors usually have a tab for easy peeling. I noticed a screen protector on my Fold 4, but knew not to mess with it because for one, I could barely even see it and two, there was no tab to pull it off. Samsung put it on for a reason.
I have mine damaged 3 days after the warranty expired. Never buy this kind of phone. It just damaged naturally. Never, never, never have a phone like this, you&#39;ll just regret.
2023 and im watching...yes they r good now
This z fold 4 is good. DAMN good.üòÅ
here in 2023 and folding phones are definitely pretty good now!
I bought mine after 3days it gets broken
About 6 months into my fold 3 that protective screen layer started to get peal off on one of the corners. So I decided to remove it. Nothing happen to my screen all working well. Now 9 months in I notice a hair thin crack down the middle where it folds. Phone still works perfectly fine and its not much noticeable but I wonder if this is the beginning of the end, will see.
Buyer beware.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=345">5:45</a> ü§¶ You didn&#39;t read what Joanna wrote. SHE was the one who peeled that corner of the film up!
Hey, it&#39;s 2023 still, theybare pretty bad! I have seen fold 4 and flip 4 in person, and they are bad, not as bad, but still!
One my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 Got that issue and is just did the same thing like in this video and I didn&#39;t even do nothing about my Samsung z fold 3
I never removed my and it still is breaking after only a year. Trying to get it fixed by Samsung is like pulling teeth the so called service centers will tell you we don&#39;t work on the folds like they don&#39;t want the responsibility of fixing it. This is not good for Samsung getting rid of the note was bad and not putting the pen inside this fold is wearing on your customers Samsung not fully testing this fold and running away from fixing it....... Apple is watching.
I have a fold 3 , the screen protector bubbled after a year , I had to peel the screen protector off, its still working, but I&#39;m waiting the other shoe to drop! Iam done with Samsung!
SAME PROBLEM!!!!!!! After 1 year It started in a small bubble then black screen!!!!  Very disappointed!!!!!!  Out of warranty cannot cover!!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!  It&#39;s a scam!!!!!!
Buying a fold phone or any foldable screen device is really a waste of money. I have my Galaxy z fold screen black out resulted merely from the effect of folding and opening. Samsung owe me money.
I have the flip and my phone did the same thing. My phone is currently getting fixed
Don&#39;t forget, sun exposure and opening it cold.
I have never tried to peeloff the film, there was a note on it, but it&#39;s broken anyway
They should do a screen that resist all this with out a plastic that eventually will peel off regardless,  when we take it to the beach and sand goes inü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just happen to my fold 3
2023 is coming.
I call it practice makes perfect since galxy fold 3 is much better
zold 3 replaced the inner screen protector. I sent it in which was a big mistake and now they cannot find where my phone was delivered to the repair center in texas.  I am thinking about going over the I hate to say it Iphone.  I have been a samsung fan since the note 5.
I am definitely not treating myself to buying this phone now! Ugh...back to doing more research on which Galaxy to go for!
Samsung Exchanges ONLY The Review Ones, They Don`t dO tHAT for People Who Are Not Youtubers With Gazilion Subscribers
No üò°
Grow a pair and show the footage of the phone failing.   Yea, Samsung might get angry and not send you any more freebies.
Why is YouTube showing me this 3 years later ?
Hello sir I couldn&#39;t hear any sound either phone calls or media sound..only I can hear when the phone is fold can you help me
Samsung devices are just failing by the day , broken screen, blowing up battery üò¢
Chill bro
Glad my fold 3 is still going strong no way in h3ll was I going to upgrade maybe fold 5 it looks like Samsung tried its best to fix the fold 3 screen protector bubbling up at 9 months mark I guess using more glue they thought would fix it lol
I have a Z fold gen3. 6 months old and a hairline crack has appears in the screen fold. Sent it back to Samsung and they want 520$ to repair telling me it‚Äôs not covered by the warranty because I broke the screen WTF! Any advise?
I have a very bad memories with samsung. Battery exploding, samsung lying about benchmark etc. Not going back to samsung. Smartphone was suppose to make life easier.
Thanks Marques for your informational review üëçüèΩ. Recently read that the new Z FLIP 4 having issues with cracked anf peeling screens for folks in Poland as well. I have a. S22 Ultra with no plans to buy either of the Z Fold PHONES at present but perhaps in The future, so sure Hope Samsung gets tjisvtern issue fixed.
I&#39;m definitely one of those crazy tech people who like to see the boundaries being pushed as I currently hold the samsung z fold 3. I&#39;m glad they have warnings now as soon as you start up the phone about that screen, and put rubber stoppers around it to stop things getting caught on the lip. I think they still have a good way to go, but their Atleast learning and improving the design to actually be more resilient,  and I&#39;m excited to see what they do to the fold 5 to make it even better and more reliable, with dust protection added to their water resistance, less crease, stronger screen so nail don&#39;t damage it, and the best hardware inside the phone. It&#39;s an exciting future for sure with foldables

&quot;I can&#39;t wait for a 2023 video where I am saying &#39;folding phones are getting really good&#39;...well, we made it. Next year is that video, and I am confident that will be the comment he mentions. Well done Samsung, Xiaomi, and others. Well done with your prediction, Marques.
i love my z fold 4
Anyone who noticed &quot;foreshadowing&quot;
Watching this video after galaxy Z Fold 4 launch and its impressive how much Samsung has improved the fold &amp; flip series :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=537">8:57</a> How about 2022? üòÄ
Macbook decal?
imagine removing the peel and phone would explode ü§£
A folding phone is a disaster waiting to happen
Hay
its a new tech that we used like old tech
Mine broke just after a month but didn&#39;t remove the screen protector. No buldge. <br><br>It broke along the seam with 1/2 inch- inch long hairline distortions within the seam spreading into crystals breaking.<br><br>I did not apply pressure to the screen when closing. <br><br>They did not care to inspect mine. I was sent to a 3rd party authorized repair service that denied fixing under warranty because while in their eyes it should be... they had never received payment for any such repair by Samsung due to Samsung denying it falling under warranty later on without reason to why it should be denied.
This whole fold fiasco was the most asinine idea ever. Doesn&#39;t seem to have durability quality attached
Just had this happen to my fold 2, any suggestions ?
This guy should make tech videos
How do you contact Samsung about theses broken screens. I&#39;m getting the run around. Thanks
I&#39;m talking about how to fix a phone not some dumb reason a tablet broke
I broke mine screen too. Unfortunately i did not remove screen protector,nor it fell down or any damage. I think its manufacturing insufficiency and worst part is they dont replace it for free under warranty. I feel they must pull back all the units.
I didn&#39;t have a warning sticker but could tell it was glued down , what case are you using ?
Samsung told me i lost my warranty after 5 months because i peal off the screen protector. I buy from samsung a leather case and everytime i open the phone the leather goes inside on back and you force the phone to open (not hardly but you cand feel the diference and finally i found few crack on big   screen along the canal. Never buy a Samsung. I pay 1700¬£ and they get rid of me very quickly.
my fold display also broken but I&#39;ve got a problem now because I&#39;ve done hard reset is there any other way to start-up my phoneü•≤ü•≤
Excited for that 2023 video üòÅ
So, when are you going to test/review of T-Mobile Internet Service?
I bought my fold 3 a few months ago, the exact same thing happened to me, the screen cover looked like it could be removed, and then a day later a black line started appearing in the middle, a few hours later, the toucj on the screen stopped working. Very unfortunate especially for the price that u pay for it.
W!
hi there sir .<br>grandad from brittain  sadly same old low spec rubbish flogged at a new number with extremely very high price tag  .<br>know watt we really won&#39;t is 3TB internal and sd card micro . plus battery graphere nothing less.
Me: <b>goes to remove what appears to be film on the Z Fold‚Äôs big screen</b><br><br><b>Z Fold: We don‚Äôt do that here</b>
Who knew 3 years later this phone turned out to be one of the most reliable phones I&#39;ve ever owned, and I bought it used.
Ur dumb but that‚Äôs what you get for loving android
i would not want this phone even if it was free
My just broke been less than a week
I just broke the screen by droping a salt shaker on the hinge area of the big screen. left a big bright spot on the big screen. it sucks its not robust at all for ruggued use.
People even don&#39;t read instruction.
Y did Marques go back in time and get unaged by 10 yrs straight ??
Had it 1 month
MINE TOO  HAVE A FEW BUBBLES ON SINGLE SCREEN WONT WORK  THIS SUCKS
Why the h*ll YouTube is suggesting me this video in 2022!!!
I got my fold in January.  I  have only had it for a solid month.  And as I am watching your video, I noticed a little speck of color on the bottom of the screen.  I can see blue/red/green in it. This just happened literally now. Please speak about this because...WHAT THE HELL! It&#39;s present even on the home screen.  It&#39;s like over exposure in that area. Where the light is not in sync with the rest of the screen.
my z fold 3 screen just broken from his self &#39; i didnt remove any layer or something like that
i was used the phone and extremely  the inside  screen  showed up a white line on the screen ....it appears  suddenly  ....i tired  to restore ....i was by customer service at my city  and they mean ... we cant help you with it ...i have to pay the repairing by my self.....please contact  me to share my experience
Okay everybody!<br>Iit is now two years later, and it&#39;s time for everyone to trade a units in for upgrade! ...To the Z fold three! Why? Well, before their Z fold 2 appears  with cracked screens, of course!<br><br> I don&#39;t know why people would be so naive, as to peel off the screen protectors, when it&#39;s obvious there for protection!<br>People actually pay to buy screen protectors, and those after market screen protectors will even damage the existing screen protector, because they bubble Up in center!<br> So, it is the &quot;lifting&quot; of the screen, what ruins the unit. Repeat, &quot;lifting of the screeeeen&quot;...<br><br> So the smart advice, (since you already invested into this thing and you are already used to the form factor) is to quickly trade in the Z Fold2 lemonade, before it crackles up in the folded screen area, and so move on to the Z fold THREE!...<br><br>It is better than having headaches down the road... <br>This is what happens when you invest in latest technology. You have to &quot;bite the bullet&quot;, and keep on riding that wave of Technology, until you find a decent model of reliability, which of course, the folding screens will never be, haha.<br> That is just the nature of things.
I don‚Äôt really take points off for this cause come on, it‚Äôs bendable glass, there‚Äôs gonna be a couple of hiccups. It‚Äôs still a very interesting idea that is going continue to advance like everything else, and I‚Äôm excited for it
Why you&#39;re have an Egypt flag üòÇ‚ù§
Fold 3 is better &amp; the 4 will be even better
My phone crackdd after 2 weeks after peeling thr screen protector
Tech nobody needed <br>Never heard anyone saying they need a foldable screen. <br>We were fine without <br>And that plastic screen that folds, looks cheap
Trial and error few more years of getting it wrong to get it right
in 2023 folding phones are getting pretty good i can Assure you they are Marques of 2 years ago üëçüèæ
Shows Buying Phones Old is Best!<br>Wait awhile for a better price and letting people waste money at launch to work out the bugs!
Galaxy fold phones have had this extra layer since the beginning and have told people that those aren‚Äôt screen protectors‚Ä¶years now dude
Same problem happened to my z fold 3 when I peeled off the protective layer.
$2K!
My dads Phoenix have that Two but it is a galxzy s 10
2022!!!!!!!
Hi bro your sharing on fold 3 is pose a good advice / suggestion to me .
It feels like a fad to me.
2 years later, I bought a Z Flip 3, and there was no warning printed anywhere in the packaging. I didn&#39;t peel it because I&#39;ve seen it before online, but what if I didn&#39;t know about it beforehand?
You know that technology and vanity has gone too far when they HAVE to make smartphones with folding displays. For what..
I&#39;m looking back at this thinking: these tech reviewers saved Samsung. <br><br>Imagine if they didn&#39;t peel the protector off and the first gen fold got into the hands of customers. There would be a mass recall. It&#39;d be a PR nightmare.
M late to this review,,my man&#39;s galaxy fold gone black too.
I love this guy ! So sharp in his reviews
Hi! Where did you get that MacBook skin?? It‚Äôs terrific üòé
Glad I waited for the Z Fold 3.
Lesson: don&#39;t buy phones with foldable screens.
This has been on my watch list for years and I just now watching it üòÇ
Didn&#39;t the oled switch have the same problem?
This is a dumb phone YO!
I was watching this video after I peel off the screen protector rip me
ƒ∞f protective layer can&#39;t be peel off that will be a part of screen Samsung
So there are still some serious flaws/issues with folding displays... yet Marques you support and excuse it. While Microsoft&#39;s 2nd Duo, was picked on for the smallest issues.  I never would have expected to see any bias from you sir, sad. If you love tech you should love the tech no matter who makes it.
Kkhlh
&#39;The&#39; iPhone, &#39;The&#39; Galaxy S10. Please this Apple branded double speak is bothering me.  üòí I&#39;m not salty or trying to be rude it&#39;s just bothersome and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one either.
Why iam even watching this? I cant even effort it üòÇ
It&#39;s pretty simple. Put a sticker on the screen saying, warning do not remove screen protector blah blah blah damage phone. Obviously the sticker itself, you can remove. Make the sticker yellow and red on each side of the closing screen.

You sound like you‚Äôre awkwardly trying to defend it. This phone is a piece of shit, and so are all the other folding phones
Remember when Samsung made fun of Iphone for not having foldable displays ? Who is laughing now /
My girlfriends Fold 2 broke after 6 months. It was in prestine condtion but samsung refused to repair the crqck in the fold crease because  it due to apparent damage which clearly wasnt there. SAMSUNG AUSTRALIA üëéüèΩ
Should do an update video on the evolution of the fold , would be a good watch.
Samsung fold are just crap.
I hate to sound negative but, I thought this phone was a bad idea when I first saw you with one. Not even close to production ready

So my screen protector slowly got dirty at the edges and started to peel on its own. So i peeled the protector off not knowing it was a key element in protecting the main screen. Everything went well and my screen survived a month before the screen went black in the center. This whole time I was unaware that I shouldn&#39;t have taken the protector off. The thing is I was tired of looking at the dirty peeling protector.
Cold Christmas
serious first world problems ü§ó
And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a apple fan Samsung is trash the only Samsung is good at making is tvs and appliances they just need to apple take over because when it comes to other things they suck
I opened mine Friday it had the then hair line on the main screen. I went to open my Z fold 2 today and half the screen is blacküò≠ this is definitely a widespread issue. I have never tried to remoce my screen protector or anything.. Just normal use. We shouldn&#39;t have to pay for the replacements for this BS

&quot;Scratches at level 2, with deeper grooves at lever 3. And once again my fingernails leave visible marks on the screen&quot;<br>- JerryRigEverything
Just bought it and after 24 hours it had a black screen when I open it up
Why is this recommended in 2021?
Two years later...
RIP AGAIN
I dont get why samsung isnt more transparent about this &quot;protective&quot; layer. Its clearly more essential that just protection against scratches. <br><br>Im not an apple fan but apple would never put out such an unfinished product, this is where they seperate themself from the rest of the industry
I feel poor shamed
Guys just go to nature forget these garbage , price things with no quality, just go out pick up litter protect the animals...
Okay so it sounds like garbage, shocking. What does common sense say about a foldable screen?
I think this phone is way too heavy.
I got the zfold 2 spring 2021, it is now Sept 2021 and my inside screen went out just as pictured.

I&#39;m looking back at this thinking: these tech reviewers saved Samsung. <br><br>Imagine if they didn&#39;t peel the protector off and the first gen fold got into the hands of customers. There would be a mass recall. It&#39;d be a PR nightmare.
Bruh does anyone have a video of someone peeling it off and breaking the phone? I need to see it
2021 here they&#39;ve got good

Perhaps Samsung was a little premature
I was going to buy the Fold3 but not after hearing everyone getting cracks in their screens. It just not ready for prime time..especially not for $1,700. I will wait patiently for the Note 22.

Thank you marqez brown your content is enough of an explanation
I think ü§î i know why the Samsung galaxy fold screen keeps flickering is because unlike normal smartphones the screen on these flip phones are very brittle and have transistors that can break because of how much protection their getting. That‚Äôs my guess
I think the reason why they didn&#39;t put a warning is because maybe they think we customers won&#39;t pull the screen protector because it&#39;s a non-glass display.
I likeww broke n broken wwkwkwk
It&#39;s about 2 years ago and YouTube still recommended for me
why tf would anyone get a fold lol

my fold failed yesterday.  I took of the layer because shit was getting under the corner.  raiseing it 15mm in the corner and the film was lifting getting dust and shot under the centre down the hinge . 2 months old. 2200$  not good.

Like the vaccine
I will just stick with the tried and true bar style phone with glass over the display.  They last a long time as long as you don&#39;t drop them or expose them to anything that would scratch them.  It is bad enough Super AMOLED displays (and OLED in general) burn in.  The way I see it that is a built in design flaw on its own despite the superior picture quality!!  I have had phones with IPS LCDs that never once burned in.  I even had one that I set to only turn its display off when I press the power button and left the display on all night.  It didn&#39;t do so much as the slightest bit of damage to that display!!  You try that with any OLED, AMOLED or Super AMOLED display and you WILL RUIN IT!!  That is why I prefer LCD instead.  Any kind of display with OLED anywhere in its name is made of thousands of very tiny diodes that actually decay very slowly while emitting light and it shows up as burn-in that may be reminiscent of the very early days of computers when monochrome displays where very common.  They sometimes had green or amber colored text.  I am 44 years old and have actually seen them too, they were very different!  If you saw one today it would be a bulky CRT and they were indestructible as long as you don&#39;t drop them on the ground.  They were made of thick glass and often weighed a lot, if you had a TV in the 80s (especially a big one) you would know exactly what I mean, they were sometimes very heavy!

Experience has taught me that I should never use a debut technology.
I think mkbhd has gone nuts or something because in the Samsung Zfold commercial the clearly stated that they folded the glass because the used a thin layer of Glass that could even cold so that was actually the screen itself not the protector for the glass filled with should feel its actually the screen itself which is fitted in the panel so that it can fold easily so the screen is so thin that it looks like a screen protector MKBHD is really gone nuts

I don&#39;t see the point Galaxy Fold exists
I would like to take some light to this. You said that they should work on it and test it more. But nobody actually thought about one thing. This phone is actually finished. Why? Because as technic you cant see anything else to add. It is just working. And now it is on users to tell the samsung what they want. This is natural process but most of people forget about how it looked back at times of iphone 1 - iphone 3, and eventualy iphone 4. This is natural process called evolution. So pls think about that before you will again start to trashtalk the samsung
‚ÄúI mean it should say will definitely cause a lot of damage or will break the whole phone but anyway‚Äù

I wonder if they could explain the reason why my phone randomly tells me there is no sim inserted when you can&#39;t remove the sim without sticking something in the side of the phone to eject it i know it&#39;s a 200 dollar phone but their 1500 dollar phones are doing the exact same thing and it doesn&#39;t want to run games very well either ive bought 50 dollar phones that worked better than this piece of shit

My first MKBHD video but i watched in 2019 when the problem happened
Folding screen... right now, is a complete waste of money. Its just not practice. How many folds a folding screen can hold? How strong a plastic can be.
I really thought MKBHD was wearing a lab coat in the thumbnail üòÖ
My question is why would he even fold that way to begin with who is trying to shove things in a skinnier pocket rather than trying to actually fit the whole phone in the pocket it works in the back pockets a regular phone but if you‚Äôre trying to fit your phone in the front pocket for girls it‚Äôs going to stick out halfway so for folding like that doesn‚Äôt really make any sense if it folded like a clam shell it would make more sense to me but I guess the razor made that and it was a fail honestly I didn‚Äôt even know it happened because they didn‚Äôt really advertiseAnd also I guess sometimes companies don‚Äôt release in America first which is crazy to me
What you learn<br>Is NEVER buy a fold phone.
You mean <b>It scratches at level 2 with depper grooves at level 3</b>
What were you expecting from this idiotic idea , everything on world that has moving parts break sooner or later , its just simple physics.

If it shouldn&#39;t come off, do make it removable. Seriously, Samsung. It&#39;s common sense.
Dude he‚Äôs the only guy who can pull out a brand new phone just out of thin air like ........I feel so basic
I Didn&#39;t know u had a Nintendo DS!
Tbh this failure is very understandable cos foldable screens are still such a new concept.
Samsung should really not add their own layer screen protector because its something that I as a Smartphone user would take off
Reminds me of the iphone 6 lol
Imagine being an apple fan and being like ThEy sHouldvE Spent MoRe TIme oN Its. Like my guy Apple phones take like a year to make.<br>Edit: 5 years to make a phone thats the exact same as the one before it.
Actually scratches at a level 2
The guy sounds like mighty base plate
At least Samsung replaces their phones. Imagine apple having the same issue. No replacement in a million years‚Ä¶ (not android or iOS hater btw lol)
Lol, I still have cameras that I never pulled the pre-installed screen protector off. Why would you go out of your way to peel it off if it doesn&#39;t even have a lip to start from?

Why folding?? Just use a normal phone. It has everything you need

hwy marques, am using this device for a while but I want to put a matte finished screen protector on the screens (both folded &amp; unfolded.)as the device is extreamly shiney &amp; i get troubles while using the phone outdoors specially on a sunny day. can it damage the display if i put the matte screen protector on the preinstalled one?
hi
I thought marques was a soccer player
Didn&#39;t the phone come with instructions NOT to peel it
nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=405">6:45</a> ah, I see your a man of Culture
Thats why u either buy other phone or dont put screen protector
A year later I still see no point in foldable screens, especially when they are fragile
It looks just like A Flip Phone for me.
Casually unboxes a Samsung Galaxy S10 to compare the unboxing experience
My Answer To This Video Is.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Dont Buy This Phone
alternate title: so anyway i took off half the screen
This is why you stickwith Apple
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqtyyGZvXM&amp;t=214">3:34</a> bruh the phone is having a straight up seizure
His voice is so nice
What if same thing happens with iPhone???
What is the point of this phone? Sometimes I think they just create stuff for time pass.
This guys apples bitch
Have you turned it off and on?
What a complete sad state of affair to be in were,s trading standard,s when you need them they should of jumped all over this , and way is Bronlee saying o its ok to buy faulty gear ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pro tip. don&#39;t buy samsung&#39;s, they are not worth the money.
Worlds not ready for flexisceens yet. Just gotta find the right materials.
Did anyone noticed <b>FORESHADOWING</b> ?
6 months from now i will get an galaxy fold
.
Plot twist: Jerry did it
The screen gets a little bulge<br>My mind: I wonder what it&#39;s been seeing
Well actually is leaves scratches at a level 2 and deeper cuts at a level fingernail
This is fantastic
No it is scratched at a level 2 with deeper grooves at level 3
i never take off the pre- installed screen protector to protect my phone or tablet or whatever
Idiot
Samsung is such garbage. Cheap copy phones.
the fuck
We have evolved in the smartphone world<br>20 years ago they were flip phones and now it is flip phone smartphones
I want this galaxy plus, but I don&#39;t know if I should, if it breaks often<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Well we&#39;ll find out

Just don&#39;t remove the screen protector to begin with might be a smart idea better yet stay away from &quot;foldable&quot; phones altogether
I want those phone
What if you opened it the wrong way by accident üòÇ
I got it now...
The only people disliking this video are all the dumb ass Samsung fans who are butt hurt that their $2000 folding phone is a piece of crap
Wasn&#39;t that an issue with the fold when they first released it and then they sorted out the problem since then? Or am I wrong? I have a fold and have no issues at all?
This is why I am never changing from My Nokia 3000
That&#39;s shit when it&#39;s broken it&#39;s awful when it&#39;s worse than that &gt;.&lt;!
me: Laughs in iPhone
They do not made phone case for that phone yet wasted of money
Why do companies try to create foldable phones if their screens will always scratch easily? What is the advantage of having a foldable phone if it is scratched really badly?
What a great concept.  It‚Äôs one year later and they‚Äôre selling like hotcakes.  Decade old hot cakes
Shame all the rich people congregated to share their sorrows for their luxury phones they themselves killed
Vincent Griffith ?
That phone is still not half bad.
What is a dime
My P30 still has the original screen protector! Why remove the screen protector?
&quot;How is that gonna hold up in the hands of &#39;normal people&#39; ?&quot; üòÇ
Samsung always takes the risks and bounce back with something amazing.<br>galaxy z flip looks promising will do way better then the fold
Stupidity...

F‚Äôs in the chat for all the poor suckers that paid $2k for a plastic screen now that the Z flip has glass

Nahhh, Samsung suck, waiting for apple fold :?
2000 : flip phones<br>2010 : smartphones<br>2019 : flip smartphones<br>2049 : flipbooks (a portable foldable phone which can become a tablet and laptop also). No need of buying multiple devices and just store all your music, pictures, videos, games and other shits in this incredible triple hybrid device. You can play GTA 6 in this device smoothly in 120 fps with ultra graphics.
Even with the brick of a galaxy fold 1.0 you now have, it makes it easy to get your car keys out of the void between the seat and console ;)
Each time I get a new phone I also remove the screen to                              Like this comet if you always do the same thing to
This Fold his so sensitive may you need Extra Care and care and care
Samsung didn&#39;t Put a strengthened Glass on that Unlike other smartphones and you cant install Tempered Glass?
With all this being said, I think aesthetically, it is unappealing, especially for the price point. However, it is pretty clever and is a novelty and I hope they learn from these mistakes and produce better versions down the line.
Sounds like they didn‚Äôt test the screen long enough
This video was super informative, I really love the way you broke it down! Great Job!!
2000s: flip phone<br>2010s: touch screen smartphones <br>2020s: foldable phones<br>2030s: glass phones<br>2040s: 3 in one laptop, tablet, phone.<br>2050s: bendable phone for wrist<br>2060s: projector phones
I&#39;ve always said Samsung are TRASH
Why did he buy a new s10 to show the plastic
you are on the way to the 10.000000 subscribers
Why do you take off the screen protector? I keep mine on so that i don&#39;t have to buy one right away
Why am I getting my tech news from a black?

Question: How do you feel about your new phone?<br>Answer: &quot;I don&#39;t feel 2 Grand!&quot;
Why he even peeling off the &quot;screen protector&quot; from 2000$ phone. You don&#39;t wanna protect it?? I don&#39;t think so because they gave it to him for free.
Can you make a video about where you store the phones that you have reviewed?
Hi
I just dont like folding screens until apple makes one
All I hear are excuses of why you couldn‚Äôt just leave well enough alone. Just because the kitchen sink has a hole in it doesn‚Äôt mean I got to go fuck it, use your common sense next time for tech

WHY would you take off the screen protector on a phone?  When it&#39;s time to sell the phone, if you still have the screen protector on, the screen will be in PERFECT condition!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
is it just me or does his videos have a wider aspect ratio then other channels
I would never buy this ‚Äúthing‚Äù
Dang that phone is trash as hell
My s10+ still looks brand new, still working just as when I took it out the box. Far better imo for 1k usd less and I can carry it in my pocket lol

Stupid
I just think it has something to do with the magnets . Because the magnetic force is so strong it collects so much magnetic energy from other devices or items. There for it is way to powerful for the screen it self. So like he said doesn&#39;t matter if you keep the screen protector on or not you&#39;re still gonna get a defect of something on the screen. It&#39;s like putting magnets on a TV what happens the color doesn&#39;t stay in the placement of the screen we&#39;re it is supposed to be.
Lol $2,000 dollars

How The Fuck Are You Going To Fold A Screen Without A Piece Of Film
I‚Äôm watching this on my galaxy fold<br><br><br><br><br><br>Jk obvs not I can‚Äôt afford A new phone
Actually scratches at level 2 with deeper grooves at level 3
Is it worth buying Samsung fold phone?
Well srsy i don&#39;t know why in  the hell Samsung just Made a device with 4 screens and Flex body , what next a device all Made of Crystal?
Samsung 2019 : We have foldable screen<br>Apple 2019 : our Retina shit lcd display
samsung always problem..better i buy Microsoft Duo all in..<br>Samsung wanna be future but failed
I honestly think anyone who‚Äôs bought one of these is an idiot. That goes treble after the review unit debacle. This has shown the world how poor Samsung are at designing and building hardware. Great component makers, awful when it comes to putting those components together.<br>That‚Äôs not even mentioning the ludicrous price which is enough to buy a smartphone and a few tablets too.
Geez, you&#39;d think Samsung would have a huge warning on the box or something&gt;<br><br>However, I have only once ordered a phone online.  Therefore, I haven&#39;t had the need to remove a film when I first get a phone.  Since I usually buy them in stores, I always have to buy the protective screen separately.
But thats a good thing if Samsung rushes to release ... that way other start to rush to catch up with the market and thats what keep technology going ahead of time .....
I think it shouldn&#39;t be available to buy.
People now r soooo stupid,buying expensive gadgets just to fit in the society,gooo waste ur money ...<br>...at the end of the day still a phone and it will fade...üòÇü§£

Reality:? First to market usually wins market share and followers. With that said, things have to fail before the breakthroughs. Great review as always.
Glad the phone was broken by the reviewers such as yourselves. Where are the beta test users?
8 years to develop 8 minutes to destroy

Who else is here after today&#39;s release
We need to know who stole his footage, or if he was not allowed to show it which makes him less trustworthy
This phone is shit and when it becomes main stream, Samsung is going to go down in the mud for it. Don‚Äôt waste your money!
The Marques fault!

Just curious, why didn&#39;t you get to keep the footage of peeling the plastic film off?
Cold Christmas
Mine hasn&#39;t broke yet
For Samsung you have excuses but for apple 100% No
Apple is the best
Hello Mark ass brownie
Imagine accidentally peeling off the screen
*Talks about Joanna&#39;s magically breaking despite her managing not to peel the protector off....<br><br>**Shows image of her admitting she broke it by starting to peel the plastic off just like he did.. hmm, I wonder what could&#39;ve caused that one to break 0_o
The thing cost an arm and a leg but vitally depends on a plastic that look so cheap that users thought it was a film protector? What were they thinking?
Planned obsolescence they&#39;re planning the death of your phone haha Asus doesn&#39;t do that to you Samsung will never learn and why the hell do you need two phones this is getting ridiculous people it&#39;s meant to call people that&#39;s it stop making these things more complicated with more chances to break wasting more money on shit we don&#39;t need stop it

The funny thing is, people complain when it takes Apple ‚Äùtoo long‚Äù to have new tech, features, etc.. <br>Im not an apple/samsung fan, but it‚Äôs clear Apple is a company that likes to refine more before releasing new things.
The simplest explanation possible: They folded...
Butterfly Keyboard its the same as exploding phones and phones that doesn&#39;t work the very same day? Yes, but keep doing new devices that may or not may work at all.
I think the galaxy fold is just for people who like to FLEX innovation
Good to know and watch out for. If i ever have the money, id still want to buy that phone!
Why can‚Äôt they make the hinge part plastic and the non hinge part glass?
They can actually just use two separate displays like if you use two PC monitors
8 years in development? Makes sense because flip phones existed more back then.
omg....reviewers literally peel off the protective layer...:(  and im sad because galaxy fold havent came out in indonesia
Galaxy fold: I&#39;ll be back

Galaxy fold was a joke
I personally have no interest in a folding display tablet or phone. . . However, I would love an external display that I could roll up like a yoga mat, for easy transporting! So I&#39;m all for this technology to mature and be adopted for other (larger) displays.
This is probably the most predictable result of this experiment.
Fold too fast, that&#39;s it
Youre an idiot n shouldnt be a reviewer of whatsoever.
I HATE GRAMMARLY!
looks like a rush to Market just like the Boeing 737 Max
it says it in the name, that phone was born to fold. iphone gang never fold üò§üò§üò§
well personally, this is the ugliest phone ive seen the past 5 years. its so disgusting looking. the hinge is the sexiest looking thing about this phone

Are we going back to flip phones again?
Keep note: In my eyes, slate design smartphone is the ultimate design and ultimate product. The only way to differiante is the spec. As for the future, next big thing only 2: holo display. Two way to archive that: create hollow display or make new device that can archive that. The best method, cheapest, quickest and yielding most money is the latter.

Just fix it with flex tape
Yea no galaxy told is complete shit
These people saying shit like &quot;what about flip phones?&quot; Or &quot;what about the Nintendo DS?&quot;. They are retarded as fuck, cuz this phone is the first REAL foldable SCREEN. The part of the screen, actually folds and not like the DS, which is just a screen on a piece of plastic.
The point is, it&#39;s NOT perfected technology, so you WILL expect some things to happen, like this.
Which is perfect?<br>Apple- like<br>Android- comment
Shouldn&#39;t Samsung put up some sort of warning: PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE PROTECTIVE COVER! It seems like a logical thing to do because most people will peel that thing off from a new device.
Honestly props to Samsung for trying new things with tech.
Great channel. Straight forward and clear.
Nop this not good, I shouldn&#39;t buy it.
I don&#39;t see the point in them. I&#39;d rather them make us flat slabs of glass with no ports, fully wireless with room wireless charging<br>The screen can bend, woohoo?
I kinda somehow know your Macbook

For people who can&#39;t understand<br><br>Step one: <b>unfold your wallet</b><br><br>Step two: <b>fold your wallet</b>
Because the screen is plastic and the <b>protector</b> too. Samsung says when you get the plastic protector when it&#39;s on the plastic screen, the technologies inside the display break Because it&#39;s really thick.
I hope it will upgrade to glass in some years
folding phones are alredy good ckeck the motorolla razor

With my experience with most new things let everyone buy it first sort out the problems then by it
So... 2000 bucks for a plastic screen phone... Yay?<br><br>Imho no amount of premium features can make up for that loss.
the only folded phone i trust is the Nokia 9210i Communicator
He says get good three times so go subscribe to get good gaming and of changes with them in it
lmao, Samsung should give up on trying to be the first. There was a phone before that that had folded
It‚Äôs okay... I‚Äôll just wait for apple to perfect the technology üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Why have you done this. Now we have to wait for dummies screen protector.
Samsung really  ‚Äúphoned‚Äù this one in...
I&#39;m excited for the fixed version to come out and may even consider getting one for myself. I get where these YouTubers are coming from but it really wouldn&#39;t have crossed my mind to peel off the screen protector, especially if it was a unit provided to demo and show off. I personally was fully aware of the screen protector being permanent but I just can&#39;t seem to remember how I got the info, whether it was from the Samsung FSM team or maybe even the event itself. Regardless, I do know that there were reps at Best Buy that were aware of the screen protector before everything that happened due to an internal memo sent out to BBY Mobile reps and I am sure of it because I would get calls all the time asking if the S10s would break if they pulled the screen protector. I just find it silly that us grunts that sell phones were aware of this but the YouTubers that get paid a significantly more amount of money to showcase all these phones didn&#39;t get this same information. I wanna give Samsung the benefit of doubt because a part of me just doesn&#39;t want to believe these experts were not given that information. Regardless, seeing everyone not sold on the Galaxy Fold or Foldable phones in general is completely unsurprising. I am 100% sure that when Apple comes out with there&#39;s, everyone will be elated with foldable phones. You put a Apple Logo on a pile of shit and people will buy it. I just don&#39;t see how having a small phone convert to a significantly larger display is un-appealing.  You get the best of both worlds and it&#39;s a &quot;stupid idea&quot;. I feel bad for these mobile companies that have to try to sell an obvious innovation in tech that is actually beneficial to a bunch of people that can&#39;t even see that. Looking forward to how this all develops.

Ah that&#39;s hagh
it looks like the phone was rushed to store, obviously the OLED tech is not suitable for cheap devices yet. wait 5 years and this phone will be the thickness if a piece of cardboard and wont break.
Has Samsung give a answer for this fails?
Their making it stronger and better
Hmmm, it‚Äôs almost as if a screen THAT FOLDS IN HALF is a really dumb and pointless idea. Anyone who spends money on this crap is clearly an idiot.
Amazed that a 2 grand phone was sold out, no wonder why everyone is broke.
Fucking shit. Samsung and apple are criminals taking our money legaly. Fuck them dry i still using nokia.

I&#39;d rather have a projector on my phone. Heck, let&#39;s have two, one for the screen, one for the laser keyboard and trackpad.
I&#39;m gonna be honest this is really funny
i have my phone for years and still have not taken off the pre installed screen protector :p
Stupid folding phones they are not needed
He bought a 1000 dollar phone for the screen protector. Wow
AHAHAHA suckers who buy this folding screen. This is literally an experiment and test that CONSUMERS are paying for. Why would a company bill customers to test things when they at the moment sell the most in the world? Oh ya greed....Samsung test your own stuff first.
a broken samsung is better than an apple
i wonder why samsung didnt detect this problems after releasing it
I left a like just for the jerry rig referance. Keep it up
I leave my plastics on, nothing like a fresh piece of tech.
Reminds me on the first minecraft elevator I build. It worked somehow, but it had a hole in the floor and you were killed when you were standing on the wrong block. Then I build a second version and that worked way better.

i am conflicted, he sounds white but looks black... what kind of voodoo is this?
How do you put a case on it
There had to be a discussion at Samsung which came down to, &quot;Do we allow our competition to release a foldable phone not ready for market (more than ours) and let them put a sour taste in the mouths of consumers possibly destroying the consumers conception of foldable phones, or do we release that not ready foldable phone which although it may turn people off of foldables, it will be better than what our competition can put out now and we can then piggy back off of the failure and release the next iteration on the notion that we learned from our failure.&quot;
lol read the manual u are a reviewer headass....
Trying so hard to justify his mistake..üòÇ
I&#39;ll keep saying, foldable phones doesn&#39;t make any sense
Just bring the normal foldable phones with keyboard on one side
wow for a professional tech reviewer that was a stupid mistake XD
I think Samsung is getting desperate for differentiation and innovation. All android smartphones are the same now.
What did you expect. <b><i>IT‚ÄôS A FOLDABLE SMART PHONE!!</i></b>
Why not make two separate,glass screens that come together when you open it?? Then make the inner bezel as thin as possible, so that when you unfold it,you can barely notice the line down the middle??

People who thought this was going to be a great phone 1st launch are crazy.... This style is going to take a good 3-4 different releases before i even debate it....
<b>samsung copied the nintendo ds</b>
Honestly though... Why? It feels gimmicky. Does it folding just completely make your user experience way better? I don‚Äôt see how. What‚Äôs next Smell-O-Vision? Okay not gonna lie I‚Äôd rather have that than a folding phone. I was a teenager in the 00‚Äôs and went through flip phones like gum. Ooohhh, Ahhhh. Lol. I‚Äôd rather have something solid, sturdy &amp; durable. Maybe one day they can perfect this sort of technology but why come out with it before it‚Äôs really ready? There are a lot features I‚Äôd love my smartphone to have. The ability to fold doesn‚Äôt make my list. üòâ
I wanted one but I do excavation. My phones go through literal hell. I buy the best when I do buy a new one so they last but this scares me. If it can&#39;t make it a couple of days with normal people it won&#39;t make it a couple of hours with me on the jobsite. I do love Samsung though. Currently have a note 8 which is going on 3 years with not a single issue. Granted even though my job is hell on my phones I do take care of it the best I can but at this point after this video I think ill be waiting the couple more months for the note 10 and grabbing one of those. Thanks for the heads up and keep reviewing man.
What is the reasoning for wanting to peel off what seemed to be a screen protector? Just curious.
where did u get the background of your mac?

why do people buy Samsung products, there shocking quality

Lmao flip phones were done right back in the 2000&#39;s

This is mark ass browney. Hi
Really very interesting video thank you so much <br>its really something very interesting this new category of phone and i hope so the prise it will be a little bit down because 2000 euro its not cheap things.
I knew something like this would happen. I predicted people would open and close the phone too much causing damage to the screen.

It‚Äôs just an overpriced gimmick.
Looks great when folded.
Good video. Agree that the 200k folds by robot are not enough, it&#39;s in a controlled environment without dust or erratic behavior. That testing was a failure.
When apple has a problem people say it is Apple&#39;s Fault, but when samsung has a problem everyone says it is the user&#39;s fault or it is because it is a first gen product,well that just proves how arogant and stupid u android fanboys are
Find cuticle. Starts pulling. Skins myself.
That protective cover seems like a cop-out by Samgung. Why not have it seamless?? (smooth all the way to the edge)<br>It seems like they just want to push it out and grab peoples money.<br>Money grubbing SAMSUNG... disappointing
Thanks dude for explaining what happened to the galaxy folds
They are NOT film!!!! It&#39;s literally the actual plastic screen

wane big screen just buy tablet cz phone flip screen is not the best choice...
Thx for saving my money @Marques Brownlee! Top!
Gostaria muito de ganhar um desse ... Mas como e dif√≠cil aqui no Brasil ...
Lesson: Don&#39;t innovate Samsung. Wait till Apple figures it out then copy it, that&#39;s all you&#39;re good at doing.

Samsung trying to block that unpeeling video
For the first generation buyers the insurence criteria of user error should be limited for the folding screen. because why would I be a tester for a product that is not complete and pay this huge price?? Is ƒ±t just to have this tech firstly? I do not think so! And I am wondering what does this new folding phones are adding up to our daily life? What is the advantage of it? I see that folding screen has no advantage but disadvantages for the user. The folding screen is just the show off of the brand.
i&#39;m not interested in folding phones tbh. if i wanted something square shaped i&#39;d just go buy a tablet.
wait why would you peel it though as a cheap Asian I would keep it on for a free screen protector
samsung: oops its broken<br>apple: its just a feature chill

The more expensive your phone is  the more it creates problems.
Stupid idea.  For stupid people.

Pls don‚Äôt remove my screen film b-baka!!
Sucks how marcus is controlled by these companies to not drag them across the dirt when they deserve it. People pre ordered this piece of junk for $2,000 dollars and have to worry about this
LOL imagine paying $2,000 just to have a device that breaks if you peel off the film

You push for most apple products even though it&#39;s usually overpriced crap.

Why wouldn&#39;t people buy a $2000 phone? They&#39;re already buying a $1400 iPhone... might as well escalate.
I&#39;m going to take a guess at to why these phones are being damaged (mainly the screen protectors)<br><br>With the adhesive, is it possible it is too strong that by pulling it up, it moves something out of place inside of the phone itself or even snaps or damages and cables or delicate parts inside it?<br><br>Also with the &#39;bumps&#39; on the others, perhaps because of the way it folds open and shut, maybe it caught something small that you wouldn&#39;t assume, then by opening the phone, it lodges said item into the phone itself through a design flaw?<br>(for example during the folding process, perhaps something opens or is exposed long enough for a foreign item to accidentally get pushed inside, move/disturb the internal parts and cause the damage.)<br><br>Then again I have 0 experience with building phones, so who knows (though I would LOVE to design and build my own mobile phone, that&#39;d be epic!)

It‚Äôs a shit design anyway. <br>technology has limitations aswell.
Are we just pretending this didn‚Äôt happen? are they even selling this?
It isnt a screen protector if it has to be permanently stuck on the phone
I see that Jerryrigeverything reference. I see what you did there Marques.
Samsung fould more like Samsung peal
HUGE PROBLEM!!!!!!!
Overall, folding screens It&#39;s just a bad idea. Screens are big enough on mobile phones. In may cases too big.
I never want it because it&#39;s thick when folding.But it is good. I am from Baku.Hello America

Samsung didn&#39;t rush anything for sure. I think we will have to see how Samsung fixes the fold / film issues, but we shouldn&#39;t ignore the user error that is absolutely involved in how it failed.

It just seems weird to peel off a screen protector that is installed by the manufacturer. Equally so to not differentiate between protective film - which is usually placed over any screen as part of the packaging and has a tab to assist in its removal, and a screen protector - an additional layer of either some sort of polymer or glass to presumably help protect said screen. <br><br><br><br>But maybe that&#39;s just me.
that phone is perfect in one aspect an business person can carry one phone with a computer ipad  internet all in one which is great make a phone call then go on computer or ipad back to phone
samsung stands behind there products apple does not samsung a much better company
give me that phoneüôÑ
I buy one and that never happened to my phone all u did that especially so all   u could make a bad review on Samsung Galaxy
