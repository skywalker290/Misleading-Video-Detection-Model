Jodwr que mal partido hizo De Gea, menls mal que no lo volvieron a convocar
The GOAT was unstoppable💯🐐🇵🇹🙌
When he was about to shoot the freekick..for those few seconds ronaldo temporarily entered the zone (only anime fans would understand)
One man shouldered the burden of a whole nation, took them to almost all tournaments single handed and they betrayed him in Qatar when he needed the team to fight for him, the coach turned his back on him, team mates turned on him and the press… Ooh, Fifas tools always looking to down cast a man who came from nothing to be the BEST IN THE WORLD. They robbed him of the ballon d’or in the same year for fear of overtaking their favorite media son messi and instead gave it to Modric who didn’t even win the World Cup (at least they said it was a World Cup year). I already had my reservations about Fifa and their awards in 2010 when Messi won it and officially dismissed it in 2018. <br>Thank you LEGEND RONALDO for everything, all the sweet memories and beautiful goals I will never forget especially the one against Juve in the UCL which had Even rival fans clapping. These deluded Messi fans can call u all d names they like tapnaldo, crynaldo, boxnaldo, penaldo and what other names, they know the truth you are one of the most skillful player to ever play the game, they know the truth you have more outside the penalty goals than their goat, they know the truth you have more solo goals than their goat, they know the truth you have more goals with ur weak left foot than their goat has with his right foot, you have more headers, you have more acrobatic goals, and you have more thunderbolts than their goat and yes it pains them to accept… you have more total GOALS than their goat both at club level and national level, at 38 man is still doing things nobody expected but at 36 their guy is the pink boys team and choking opponents anyhow these days 😂😂😂<br><br>CRISTIANO RONALDO, the BEST THERE EVER WILL BE
Amazing CR7 ! <br>The greatest of all time ! ❤❤❤..

❤
Someone watched this game and still decided to bench him against Morocco.... If he played full fame against 🇲🇦 and lost... Yes that&#39;s fair.. We&#39;ll all know he played and lost like it should be... Not subbing him in when you see that you&#39;re losing 1 to nil
22/11/2023😊
Who see 2023 they are legend 😅😅
If you can score 3 against Spain in a World Cup match, then you&#39;re the GOAT!!!

Ronaldo scored this useless hat trick in group stage and in the next round against Uruguay penalty naldo ghosted... probably he was pregnant
The match Pendu fans watch to satisfy their big ego, a little consolation after 2022/12/18!
and suddenly people forget how godly is cristiano
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/dv90XtfhAurw8gTgzar4DA"></a>
Por onde anda o Diego Costa ?
but his fans will say this was a penalty but mock argentinas penalties, hypocrites
Everybody talks about Ronaldo’s performance no one talks about Diego costa ‘s performance
Gg free kick. Worst nightmare for goalies

Real sports men will understand how much pressure there is in a free-kick at 88th min and that to your country is 1 goal behind and also if you lose this match you&#39;ll be out of worldcup. There is no football player who can do this not even Messi can do that. That&#39;s why who knows real hardwork and real football will always choose Cristiano Ronaldo over Messi.. always ❤️❤️🔥🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rp2aLQl7vg&amp;t=84">1:24</a> 😳
What an influence 🐐
One of the greatest World Cup my opinion
Ofikal. Grand. Svi.
Skloni. Te. Se.      Svi.   Sem. Fudbala.  I.  Ove. Ekipe
Don&#39;t know why Pavard&#39;s goal was ranked better than Nacho&#39;s.
When you realize ronaldo beated Morocco at 2018

Ronaldo Scores Free Kick to complete his hattrick Commentator: Ohhh Genius Absolute Genius my favourite Commentary i miss the 2018 World Cup so bad
That Volley from Nacho Fernandez was Satisfying a perfect strike and this match is One of my favourites i still remember watching this match Ronaldo was on fire and i didn&#39;t knew that Bruno Fernandes played in a World Cup before i didn&#39;t notice him playing when watching this match i didn&#39;t see the linups i was 8/9 years old now I&#39;m 14/15 years old I&#39;ve watched the 2022 WC and i just don&#39;t want Ronaldo to retire the great CR7
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rp2aLQl7vg&amp;t=8">0:08</a> bro really gives pen for this🤣🤣
That free kick at 88’ is absolute genius for sure
CR7❤❤❤❤🎉😊
Have you seen messi in 2022 wc now don&#39;t say penalties becoz u haven&#39;t watched full match so you will never know the assists he made the game he created
Whenever I feel sad, I don’t know why I always come back to this video. Once a month or whenever really, it’s so amazing how much joy the 🐐 can bring you.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rp2aLQl7vg&amp;t=98">1:38</a>   Ronaldo oh genius absolute genius!!!

That&#39;s why he&#39;s the goat THE GOAT ❤
Diego costa What a forward, what a striker!

Perfect match 1 penalty, 1 normal goal, 1 free kick

Yearly re-rewatch
&quot;Cristiano Ronaldo only scores goals against Cyprus and in unimportant matches.&quot;<br><br>World Cup 2018. Hat-trick vs. Spain. The last one, this gem ☝🏽

De glued 💀
2023 hits hard
As spanish I never respected a footballer more than Robaldo , he deserves everything, at least we’re brothers and we’re both iberians 🇪🇸🇵🇹 imagine if we had a national team combined we would rule the world
I don’t think people realise, playing against Spain is literally playing against Real Madrid and Barcelona combined.
Still India vs Pakistan has more views on youtube

I remember watching this live with my dad and when Portugal got that free kick call, I was like &quot;Ronaldo&#39;s gonna score&quot; and my dad was laughing telling me theres no way, and when he scored that 3rd goal, it was the moment I became a Ronaldo fan it was crazy
Only in the first match, both teams immediately put out their best abilities

A penalty from a dive, a keeper mistake and a deflection against an average Spain team that lost to Russia and Morocco in the wc, this gotta be the single most overrated individual performance of all time🤣🤣🤣🤣
Suiii
Ronaldo goat 🐐
Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩💪💪💪
Coming back to this in 2023. After Mbappe’s heroics despite being in a losing effort, this is the second best individual performance in a match in World Cup history.
Former world cup winners couldn&#39;t win cause of one man...Ronaldo
This world cup didnt feel as a world cup compared to 2022 2014 and 2010
🐐
This match was literally <br><br>Ronaldo Vs Spain <br>3              :          3
sssssUUUUUUUUUU
❤❤❤❤❤❤
The greatest match ever ?
watchin&#39; in 2023
amazing!!!!!
It&#39;s sad  how everyone forgets about diago costa. I didn&#39;t even saw a single comment apriciating his performance. yes Ronaldo&#39;s performance was great but diago costa went underrated due to rono&#39;s performance. His first goal was way better. Take a bow costa 🫡
I still remember this game I was in a hotel in voi constituency ,Taita Taveta county 2018 ,Kenya watching the Game ...CR7 is absolutely genius 😍
Who is the commentetor of this match
That’s betrayal — Portugal is next to Spain/España and Ronaldo played for Real Madrid, and which is in Spain

Şimdi fifa RONALDOYA Saygı duymuyor
Props to Ronaldo but De Gea is such a bottler. It’s crazy how many blunders this guy makes for both club and country. How is this guy the first choice keeper for Spain.
Nah but nacho nacho really scored

현재 메시의 팬이지만 이 경기에서 호날두 선수는 엄청난 활약을 보여줬습니다. 월드컵에서 해트트릭을 하여 동점을 만든 호날두 선수 정말 대단했고 정말 재미있게 시청할 수 있었습니다.

As a Moroccan for me both Portugal and Spain are enemies that may become friends one day if they recognize their past fatal mistakes but France is a real enemy I wish Argentina win them even this last is not a friend either but also suffered from Spanish and British colonianism

Watched Morocco vs Portugal match at Qatar World Cup 2022 which Portugal lose...<br>After Knowing This could be last world cup of Ronaldo<br>I was very sad 😭😭😭<br>that he would now never won a World Cup....
If Ronaldo becomes Monstrous ,then whatever be the situation... it&#39;s on his hands.such a match....But after the loss of moracco,it&#39;s really broken....WC is unlucky to grab Ronaldo&#39;s victory..Well Messi will finish it off hopefully...He will definitely share his victory and give credits to Ronaldo and Neymar well they deseved too..
Don’t write off Cr 7

Yes football is a team sport but exemplary individuals like Ronaldo make such a difference. I watched the match and it isn’t just the goals but the passes and runs Ronaldo made which constantly threatened the opposing team and was clearly a cut above the rest.
Miss this ronaldo
We Will Miss 2018 Ronaldo 😞💔

In 2022 4 year later Qatar sucks so bad smelling trust on players league and world football ⚽🏈 just ends

Need this tomorrow
Watching this before the match against Morocco and after so much bad press hes been getting... truly carring an entire country on his shoulders.. CR7 Legend
The free-kick goal is very impressive. Having said this. In the first goal he dives to get the penalty, it&#39;s obvious. The second one is a mistake by the Gk.
Who&#39;s watching in 2022?
The contrast between this version Ronaldo and the current version Ronaldo  is HUGE
Seeing this as they bench Ronaldo round off 16
Nacho&#39;s goal was also on another level
HAT TRICK THO?
Personally, this is Cristiano&#39;s peak performance in a game.
I’m watching this in 2022 WorldCup night .. 1:26Am ..with Match of Argentina 🇦🇷 and  Netherlands 🇳🇱 in my another mobile .. Where Argentina has already scored 1 goal  ..

To all haters of Cristiano Ronaldo: Neither you or your sons or your grandsons will ever reach to the heights of Cristiano&#39;s right ball. Cristiano Ronaldo is the complete football player, a leader, a machine. He&#39;s the living definition of sacrifice and hard work.
