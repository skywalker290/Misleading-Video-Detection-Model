There needs to be Captain Marvel versus Rogue before they dismiss the actress.

Um, perhaps? You will then we also see.<br>That&#39;s so very, soon from this show only<br>In October, for any week until? It is ready<br>Away yet.
This is the Karen that killed the MCU. The Captain Marvel sequel is the worst flop for<br>MCU ever losing over 700 million.
the trailer is enough to see the gringe and bad acting
Captain Marvel good movie 🍿
&quot;I never did that&quot;
&quot;I know you&#39;re outhtere BI&quot;
me?
bro we dont swim in the same waters
It&#39;s not common sense?
Larki main dom hai 🫰❤
The Marvels ends its theatrical run as the biggest flop in 15 years of MCU history. <br>Needing 700 million to break even Disney loses millions promoting wahmen power. <br>Seriously a block of cheese has more personality and screen presence than Brie Larson
The Captain Marvel sequel The Marvels is the biggest flop in MCU history as it <br>continues to tank at the box office hitting new lows. After Tuesday The Marvels <br>only earned $495,315 as Disney and Brie Larson no angrily lash <br>out at customers blaming them for their own failure
yhgj
Wow the trailer got more views than the movie😂
Bowel movement.
i rmbr working in electronics at target and these mfs had this playing on loop every day😭trash trailer
Who knew 4 years later they would absolutely butcher captian marvel 2 aka (the marvel&#39;s) 😢
The Captain Marvel sequel makes history as the lowest opening for MCU movie ever.<br>Disney loses millions as The Marvels bombs at the box office already down -74.3% since<br>opening last week.
The Captain Marvel sequel is officially a flop RLMAO!!!!
How can I see the movie online? Thank you.
More Disney garbage
4 years later, I still get chills watching this trailer
So that&#39;s the excitement before on an origin. Then the new one is getting there.
Brie Larson got so much hate.. but i really enjoyed this film a long with her acting

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=78">1:18</a> is amazing
The starting of a bad marvel movie
More woke genderswapping to fool the younger generations. The original Captain Marvel was a white man &amp; history refuses to be erased or rewritten. Search for the truth, it&#39;s out there for you to discover,  and destroy the WOKE lies....
Boring movie starring vapid Brie Larson. Easy pass.
Captain marvel originally in the comics was male. Another movie with swapping
Ik this movie isn’t exactly the best but it’s still pretty good, I truly think The Marvels is Gonna make people go back and watch this and appreciate it morw
L movie!
THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED
charlize theron as captain marvel😤
This movie and the build up for the character is in the top notch marvel imo.<br>And Brie Larson did a good job why the hate ?
Your moments from Death the energy Limit, and the Wreck not ok.
WinterSierra, Desert, ASHHEAD.
Better clean area?
Bipolar.
Guitar was created in 1950... music from Past type of awesome...
Coming back to this amazing trailer after The Marvels trailer came out, which is bad.
This is why I like this movie.
See how strong this Aviator became. From flying into outer space by herself.
Still one of the best Marvel Movies ❤🎉 can&#39;t wait for the Marvels to hit Theater soon❤❤❤
2023 e eu ainda não me curei . Obrigada MCU !!!
I think I need to get that firefox extension that lets you see how many dislikes there are.
Crazy part is the fact that im not a fan on the trailer im going to be labeled a troll and just bombarding this trailer with dislikes and negative comments.  Its bad alright simple as that. Marvel has really strayed away from its original recipe.  Sad
Better than the Marvels Trailer by a mile
Go woke go broke!
&lt;Rubbish film that Disney cooked the books for to avoid a flop.&gt;
Who&#39;s here after the announcement of The Marvels trailer 🎉
😁
I remember coming here with my mom to watch the movie. It was abseloute garbage the storyline was trash I legit fell asleep
Only two Avengers dared to face Thanos voluntarily! Tony Stark &amp; Captain Marvel!<br>And Tony accepted that Captain Marvel is <b>GREAT</b>

&lt;Film so rubbish Disney cooked the books to avoid a flop.&gt;
Victoria Alonso<br>U are destroyed
&lt;A character so rubbish it took years to get a sequel. A sequel that keeps getting delayed.<br>  Ha ha ha!&gt;
such a great trailer!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=64">1:04</a> top gun
É um filme que é no máximo decente mas não precisa de uma sequência, o filme só fez sucesso porque tava no meio dos vingadores infinite e endgame.
&lt;Film so rubbish Disney keeps delaying the sequel after early test screenings of the Marvels performed horribly.&gt;
Trash
&lt;Film was so rubbish it played to countless empty seats. <br>  Even Disney knows how rubbish Captain Marvel is that&#39;s why she had very little screen time in <br>  Endgame and her sequel keeps being delayed. Ha ha ha!&gt;
&lt;Brie Larson loves to masquerade a champion for equality when she stepped over<br>  Monica Rambeau to be Captain Marvel. The first female Captain Marvel in the comics was Monica.&gt;
&lt;Captain Marvel is a poor selling comic that couldn&#39;t make a profit no matter how<br>  many times Marvel rebooted the character.&gt;
Brie Larson you are the best of the best in every universe, in every galaxy
The strongest super stronger 💪💪💪💪💪 Mother of all superheroes
&lt;Film so rubbish Disney cooked the books to avoid a flop.<br>  I had a good laugh seeing pictures of people in empty cinema rooms for opening <br>  night of Captain Marvel.&gt;
&quot;Captain Marvel is the Princess of Advanced Martial Art Form and Tai Chi!&quot;
Legends watching in 2023!! 😁😁😁😁😁
&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film based on the poor selling comics. <br>  Despite the misinformation peddled by Disney and the shill media, Captain Marvel played<br>  to countless empty seats. Captain Marvel is so rubbish Disney made the<br>  sequel film a buddy team up film ha ha ha!&gt;
&lt;Remember Rotten Tomatoes allowed countless bots to post copy and paste positive reviews for Captain <br>  Marvel and the shill media telling people how great the film was. In reality Captain Marvel played to many empty seats. <br>  Carol Danvers is a rubbish character with poor selling comics.&gt;
&lt;When are Brie Larson and her Hollywood friends going to return the millions <br>  they scammed using their Time&#39;s Up MeToo charity? Brie Larson was a board member <br>  for Time&#39;s Up.&gt;
regular audiences aka normies loved this movie
Oh, there absolutely was hate against the captain marvel movie only on social media from the vocal minority , just not from regular audiences. A whole fringe industry worth of &#39;Brie Larson sucks&#39; YouTube videos made by insecure men and some female grifters emerged from it. Regular audiences, though, thought it was great and so did critics.
&lt;Rubbish boring film made for beta males and raging nasty feminists.<br>  No wonder the Captain Marvel comics sold poorly.&gt;
I honestly really enjoyed this especially after she landed on earth
Five Planets.
Uh it resulted in an explosion ony home planet them are idiot did Ironot, and zombies in Final Fantasy, then another idiot DBZ robots, and another idiot zombies on this Planet. I registered with the Galactic Federation Twice. Once recently because your freaking me out that your dying causing Planetary distractions each Planet I&#39;AM at.
Hypnosis does not work on me, I&#39;AM different?
I need you to all know that Three Layers is a Planetary Loss. I&#39;AM not sure wtf ya&#39;ll Yell about Video Games are LitteraLLy not Fake...
Three Layers of Earth TimeLine are Zombies. It is similar to Bifrost reactions...
We are a Minority is a word to Aliens.
Do not go to Final Fantasy Planet is Ironot planet do not go there you were 7 years old. Away from Final Fantasy Planet.
&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film based on a poor selling comic nobody wanted.<br>  Disney, Rotten Tomatoes, and the shill media used massive deception to make<br>  people believe Captain Marvel was an amazing film.&gt;
Underrated mcu movie
She was horrible at this role. I hated this movie
Show
I know a renegade soldier when I see one ...
&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film with occult elite puppet Brie Larson as the lead.&gt;
Kickass!
Front End Car gearbox, and Engine. Buy for friends?
The car We drive it is supercar.
Car gearbox in front, and Engine. Took my Chevy too the Levy, but the Levy Broke down.
&lt;Higher, further, faster, baby so Brie Larson can vomit again while doing maneuvers <br>  in a fighter jet ha ha ha!&gt;
&lt;Another rubbish social engineering propaganda film from the occult elite puppet at Disney.&gt;
🥺
&lt;The Carol Danvers were poor selling woke comics and this film is more woke social <br>  engineering propaganda from Disney.&gt;
I prefer Anime, DC is so much better than Marvel!!
When you first deployed to space I was Teleported to my Subsonic SpaceJet. Info for only you and me. When a girl is on a SpaceJet she is claimed by the Male on a the SpaceJet by Law. Your not allowed on any other SpaceJet you do actually know. That SpaceJet cannot let you on board illusions not allowed on board, false Visuals not allowed on board SpaceJet, people actually vaporize while in the process of going to space by Law of SpaceTravel. Yeah Family appears in the SpaceShip if you do spaceTravel I own an actual SpaceJet more than one actually it fixes actual falsehood to Correct Fact, by Quantum Chemistry Theory that I know I only needed my SpaceJet to Traverse through subsonicboom.
&lt;Rubbish radical feminist propaganda film film promoting lies and propaganda for the occult elite.&gt;
captain marvel 2 the marvels
A cinemascore
I love this movie
Christian Bale has put himself on record as believing that American culture would be &#39;much richer&#39; if the people in power weren&#39;t mostly white men.<br><br>The actor made the comments during an interview with AOL Build this past Monday as he sat with Rosamund Pike and Wes Studi to promote the upcoming Wild West drama film Hostiles.<br><br>&quot;Our culture will be so much richer the day that we stop saying, &#39;Hey, it&#39;s all white dudes who are running things,&quot; Bale said. &quot;Whether that be Hollywood, whether that be Washington, you know?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re going to get, in Hollywood, so much better films and so much more interesting stories being told, and America will become the America that the rest of the world sees it as, that makes it unique... that we recognise makes this such a beautiful, brilliant country.&quot;<br><br>Bale went on to call the US a &#39;country of inclusion&#39;, explaining that he moved his family to the States because he fell in love with the country.<br><br>Bale, who has two young children Emmaline and Joseph with the American make-up artist Sandra &#39;Sibi&#39; Blažić, applied for US citizenship in 2010.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s the reason why I moved here,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s the reason why my kids have American accents.&quot;
cool
&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.&quot;
i honestly think this was better than Thor 2 and both Black Panthers.
i honestly think this was worse than Thor 2 and both Black Panthers.
The most shitty marvel character. Hated this movie. Fr fr
Boring children&#39;s movie.
great movie
&lt;Rubbish film based on a woke comic character with poor selling comics.&gt;
&lt;Boring radical feminist propaganda film with misandrist Brie Larson as the lead.&gt;
&lt;Boring feminist propaganda film made for fools.&gt;
Like Shamwow. It is Smite good word for self.
Smite is the Word.
&lt;Rubbish radical feminist propaganda film with a rubbish munter as the lead.&gt;
&lt;The weakest MCU film filled with radical feminist propaganda and terrible acting from<br>  boring misandrist Brie Larson.&gt;
Alden Richard Pilipino 🇵🇭 Super Hero Captain Marvel Only Noypi 🇵🇭
&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film based on a poor selling woke comic.&gt;
The comics were so good, I wish the movie was the same.
&lt;Film is so rubbish Disney had to use deception to make the film a success. <br>  Disney falsely told people they needed to watch Captain Marvel before seeing Endgame, and<br>  Captain Marvel was favorably released before Endgame. Disney also falsely inflated <br>  ticket sales numbers and used countless bots on Rotten Tomatoes to create hype.&gt;
empoderada nazi
&lt;Amusing how Brie masquerades as the champion for equality when she white washed Captain Marvel.<br>  In the comics the first female Captain Marvel was a black woman named Monica Rambeau.<br>  Where&#39;s the equality Brie?&gt;
terrible movie
Steve Vadeboncoeur&#39;s spammer bots trying to get this boring trailer more support lol
cry more Steve Vadeboncoeur lol
Motivational Success Story Of Brie Larson - From Constant Failures To Captain Marvel and Avengers
When Brie Larson was a child, she was home schooled by her parents. She was very close with her mother, but was painfully shy and suffered from social anxiety.  She always struggled to make friends and felt like an outsider. She was worried about being different.<br><br>When she was 7, Brie Larson experienced a traumatic period of her life when her parents got divorced. After her dad asked for divorce and left her mother shattered, Brie’s very dysfunctional relationship with her father began and still lasts. <br>Soon after the divorce, Brie, her sister and her mother moved to Los Angeles to fulfill her acting career. They were very poor and lived in a very small apartment.<br>&quot;We had a crappy one-room apartment where the bed came out of the wall and we each had three articles of clothing.&quot;<br> “I had no toys, and I had, like, two shirts, a pair of jeans and that was it.”<br>The defining role of her career came in 2015 with the movie &quot;Room&quot;, where She plays a woman who is held captive in a shed for years and desperately tries to take care of her son.  Her amazing performance earned Larson a Best Actress Oscar and opened doors for many exciting projects in the future.  About the exciting projects.. We will see her in the upcoming movies.. Captain Marvel and Avengers - Endgame.<br>This motivational success story shows that behind every successful person there are thousands of failures that no one can see. For Brie Larson, Her career path wasn&#39;t easy. She had a difficult childhood, was insecure and broke almost her entire life. <br>“I’m still feeling insecure all the time, and most of my life has been massive failures. It’s just that now we only really talk about the successes.”<br> “I’ve failed for like 99 percent of my career. It’s only in the last couple of years where I’ve had a few successes and now suddenly I seem like a success story.”<br>“I don’t even think I can be honest with myself with how many auditions I’ve gone on my life and almost all of them I didn’t get” she said. “We’re talking about tens of thousands of auditions.”
Failures are a part of life.<br>Giving yourself a chance to try and fail, is way better than not doing anything at all.<br>The universe has lots of opportunities for those who are brave enough to survive the training and face the failures.<br>Overcome what scares you the most.<br>Let go of your fears.<br>Believe that you can become the person that you want to be.<br>and start working on your dreams today.<br>“Fear is not a choice. What you do with it is.” -  Captain Marvel
&lt;&lt;m she u??? d she u??? in the comics it was wasp a female who created the avengers and was their first leader JANET VAN DYNE WASP Janet Van Dyne, daughter of world-renowned scientist Vernon Van Dyne, is a founding member and long time leader of the Avengers, with the ability to shrink, fly and control insects...SO it should be called the  M HE U not the m she u ......using the same logic since the mcu took the leadership from a woman and gave it to 2 men iron man and captain america&gt;&gt;
&lt;it was nia dacosta and nia dacosta alone who removed captain marvel from the title......nothing to do with the mcu or kevin feige ......she removed it to support monica rambeau who used to be captain marvel and nia dacosta is a closet racist...listen to her candyman interviews...wanting to kill only whites in her movies&gt;
it was nia dacosta and nia dacosta alone who removed captain marvel from the title to support her black best friend teyonnah parris and the first female captain marvel monica rambeau
nia da costa is very pro black and since monica rambeau was the first female captain marvel in the comics and is cannon as she said on the tedd lasso interview with Brett Goldstein multiple times... she nia dacosta used her opportunity as the director of captain marvel 2 to strip captain marvel off the the title of the movie and just call it the marvels... instead of calling it &#39;captain marvel 2 the marvels&#39; The one thing nia dacosta seems to forget is that wasp from ant man was the first avenger in the comics and the first leader of the avengers...yet Evangeline Lilly  has never complained that she should have rightly been the leader of the avengers instead of iron man and captain america rightfully so....and that this is cannon...cannon as nia da costa seems to be obsessed with....Put some respect on Carol Danvers. And Monica shouldn&#39;t be sharing a title. How about giving her a solo movie!
the title change from captain marvel 2 the marvel to just the marvels was 100% nia da costa&#39;s idea not the mcu or kevin feige or marvel or disney.....it was all nia dacosta ..and since phase 4 kevin feige has given full power to the directors of the movies unlike phase 1 to 3 where he withheld the full control from the directors
when you listen to some of nia da costa&#39;s candyman interviews and even her captain marvel 2 interviews..she is very pro-black ..and didn&#39;t like candyman killing mainly blacks in the original candyman movie..so she course corrected this in her new candyman movie....monica rambeau was originally captain marvel and the 2nd leader of the avengers after WASP  even though most foirget that it was wasp not monica rambeau who was the first avenger and first leader too..nia da costa mentioned this a few times in interviews...i believe that it was nias da costa and teyonah parris that changed the title to the marvels...not the mcu or kevin feige....in phase1,2, 3 the mcu controlled everything..but since phase 4 they&#39;ve given all powers to the directors.......
Put some respect on Carol Danvers. And Monica shouldn&#39;t be sharing a title. How about giving her a solo movie!
review bombing have ruined rotten tomatoes , imbued etc...only cinemascore is reliable now
the cinemascore is the most important rating score for a movie now....
aged like a fine wine ...this movie gets better and better with each watch
&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.&quot;
I love this movie
waste movie
&lt;Rubbish propaganda promoting the hypocrisy of intersectional feminism. Feminists like Brie Larson <br>  won&#39;t tell you that feminism always placed Caucasian women at the prominent positions.<br>  This fact is proven perfectly by Disney ignoring Monica Rambeau so Brie Larson could be the star.&gt;
&lt;Captain Marvel nearly cost the Avengers the battle in Avengers: Endgame when she<br>  foolishly fumbled the Stark gauntlet. Thankfully Tony was there to make up for Captain Marvel&#39;s incompetence.&gt;
Anyone else notice the camera angle on Captain Marvel tends to be from a lower position looking up to her?  Gives off the impression that she is some how taller and more powerful than a woman of average height.
I love this movie
the long kiss goodnight but in space with aliens
Fantastic movie
Lousy movie
&lt;Rubbish film starring radical misandrist Brie Larson. While Disney claims this film sold billions <br>  the fact is Captain Marvel played to countless empty seats. <br>  Carol Danvers was a poor selling comic. It&#39;s ridiculous to think all of sudden people<br>  love Carol Danvers.&gt;
Boring movie based on a boring character.
the long kiss goodnight but in space with aliens
I love this movie
the story of a Misandrist
Why is ok to take an artists life&#39;s work and corrupt it so dramatically? How many stories now?<br>Think of your favorite piece of music, is it ok to disrespect the artist&#39;s soul who sacrificed all other lively pleasures and commitments to get said soul onto the page, by changing the notes while keeping the name, just to make a few people who prefer their favorite notes in its place, happy? Most of Life for most of us, is not inclusive. Do we have to destroy every much loved creative cornerstone of Western Artists&#39; storytelling, because its not how the story would go if, someone else wrote it???? JUST WRITE YOUR OWEN STORY, WITH ITS OWN NAME.
&lt;When you compare Brie&#39;s poorly written Mary Sue Captain Marvel to well written strong female <br>  characters it really shows how pathetic and comical Disney&#39;s effort was. Legends like Ellen Ripley, <br>  Sarah Connor, Alice Abernathy, and Princess Leia really make Captain Marvel look silly.&gt;
Only watching this movie because of Endgame but not lie the trailer gives me green latern vibes
Ever since the dawn of humanity, men has made tons of movies/stories/games and so-called scientific researches about how men are better than women.<br><br>2022 and YT, reddit etc, are seeing a massive surge of men still hating on women only because. Just because.<br><br>Still pretending that all men are better than all women.<br><br>And that&#39;s fine.<br><br>Turn the tables around though, and see all the men cry in agony!<br>You don&#39;t like it?<br>Then WHY THE F should women be ok with men&#39;s constant debate on women&#39;s worth!?<br>It&#39;s not ok but men wont stop doing it everyday with podcasts and endless videos etc.<br>Like a neverending plague.<br>Men love to downsize others as if it&#39;s their birthright and sole purpose, yet cant face it being done to them.<br>F typical.<br><br>We are people too. You dont like it being done to you, STOP DOING IT TO ANYONE ELSE WHO ISNT A WHITE HETEROSEXUAL MAN.
Critical Drinker is right Brie Larson is a plank of wood her movies are terrible
Brie Larson recently admitted nobody wants her Captain Marvel
Marvel&#39;s worst movie
Marvel bots liked this movie more than people did
Captain Karen
worst Marvel movie ever made
I love this movie sm
love this movie
&lt;Interesting how Brie Larson masquerades as a hero for women while she does nothing <br>  to help oppressed women in places like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.<br>  Western feminists like to make a big show of their &quot;equality&quot; work while taking no action.&gt;
&lt;Brie Larson lived up to her terrible reputation with her latest interview.<br>  Such a nasty response from this overrated munter Brie who makes rubbish films.&gt;
Secret War is coming !!!!
Still one of the best scores and best pieced together trailer that Marvel ever made.
Dumb kids movie.
Come on fellas the Movie was good.<br>And yeah the bots tho 😂
&lt;Even Brie Larson knows her Captain Marvel is rubbish ha ha ha! So angry in her latest interview.&gt;
monica rambeau now has her own comic...titled PHOTON not captain marvel...so please RENAME the marvels to CAPTAIN MARVEL 2 the marvels.
eternals shows that now in phase 4 the directors have been given full power..unlike in phase 1,2,3 where the mcu kevin feige had full power ..so it was nia dacosta that decided not feige or the mcu....and teyonah is her friend...
WASP WAS THE FIRST FEMALE AVENGER AND LEADER OF THE AVENGERS....yet you don&#39;t hear Evangeline Lilly complaining about not being the leader of the avengers etc...unlike teyonnah parris who just complains...no wonder Kathryn Hahn is more popular and has her own tv show..even though monica rambeau is the 2nd most used character in wandavision
Put some respect on Carol Danvers. And Monica shouldn&#39;t be sharing a title. How about giving her a solo movie!
nah i think its cuz direct nia de costa wants this movie to be about teyonah paris&#39; monica rambeau so she doesnt want the title to focus on the white girl
In Marvel mythology, Captain Marvel is the legacy of Mar-vell. Carol was his girlfriend and got her powers straight from him, becoming Ms Marvel. Monica Rambeau had nothing to do with him, and was named CM only for retaining copyright on the name. Carol was the right choice.
it was nia dacosta and nia dacosta alone who removed captain marvel from the title to support her black best friend teyonnah parris and the first female captain marvel monica rambeau
The darkest moment in Monica’s life came when she had to fight against Marrina, wife of the Sub-Mariner. Marrina had turned into a giant sea monster called Leviathan and Monica needed to lead the hunt against her. To stop the creature, Monica transformed into a bolt of lightning. However, she conducted herself against the surface of the ocean and nearly killed herself. Although she managed to survive, Monica lost her powers.
it was nia dacosta and nia dacosta alone who removed captain marvel from the title......nothing to do with the mcu or kevin feige ......she removed it to support monica rambeau who used to be captain marvel and nia dacosta is a closet racist...listen to her candyman interviews...wanting to kill only whites in her movies

the title change from captain marvel 2 the marvel to just the marvels was 100% nia da costa&#39;s idea not the mcu or kevin feige or marvel or disney.....it was all nia dacosta ..and since phase 4 kevin feige has given full power to the directors of the movies unlike phase 1 to 3 where he withheld the full control from the directors
when you listen to some of nia da costa&#39;s candyman interviews and even her captain marvel 2 interviews..she is very pro-black ..and didn&#39;t like candyman killing mainly blacks in the original candyman movie..so she course corrected this in her new candyman movie....monica rambeau was originally captain marvel and the 2nd leader of the avengers after WASP  even though most foirget that it was wasp not monica rambeau who was the first avenger and first leader too..nia da costa mentioned this a few times in interviews...i believe that it was nias da costa and teyonah parris that changed the title to the marvels...not the mcu or kevin feige....in phase1,2, 3 the mcu controlled everything..but since phase 4 they&#39;ve given all powers to the directors.......
I really liked this movie and Bree Larsen in it.  Really looking forward to the new one:)
Marvel sure has many bots here praising their dumb movie LOL!
good movie
&lt;&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.&quot; &gt;

the long kiss goodnight geena Davis but in space
&lt;&#39;You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain…&#39; –Brie Larson&gt;
After she hulk people  realized this is masterpice
Really boring but could have been saved by better casting.  British actress Ruth Wilson can make even dull dialogue fascinating and full of mystery.  She would be a fantastic Captain Marvel but maybe would not want the part.  How many actors can make being a sociopathic murderer so entertaining?  Watch Season 3, episode 4 of Luther.  (best if you watch the whole thing until then of course)
a movie so bland you need new youtube accounts to tell the world how great this movie is
boring
&lt;&#39;You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain…&#39; –Brie Larson&gt;
This movie was better than alot of phase 4 stuff
what a waste of money.
When Marvel uses bots to approve of their movie you know it&#39;s boring.
The whole issue with her being bland bothers me. She’s supposed to be a trained fighter pilot. They’re literally trained to compartmentalize and be bland. No emotions - lest you let them force you into a mistake. With the Kree also reinforcing that idea, of course she comes across bland. She’s doing what she was trained to do - no reaction, just do what you need to do. My brother is a fighter pilot and he acts the exact same way. Her portrayal is dead on for what she was supposed to be and I enjoyed it.
I loved this movie!  It&#39;s in the roster whenever I do a rewatch of my favorite MCU movies
There&#39;s a deleted scene where Yonn Rogg sees himself in the Supreme Intelligence and how his feelings for Carol cloud his judgment (essentially). Definitely check it out!
I love this movie, but it is an extremely underrated movieI love this movie,
we got to know how Fury lost an eye and a cat is called a Flurken, and dangerous with it! Jude Law was def a surprise, but I liked him as well. I hope when they do the second movie it shows her strengths more though. And Agent Coulston again and Maria Rambo which introduces her daughter to Wandavison. All in all? Personally? I wasn&#39;t disappointed. That&#39;s just me though :) This character is more serious than most of the women in Marvel, I liked that and BrIe as her. She gets the job done. I&#39;m looking forward to the second one.
I&#39;ve watched this movie<br>But fun fact about this, that the aliens who have spaceships which can travel 100000 light years in just 22 hours, they still needs the light speed engine formula 🤣🤣
i loved the movie
these comments are polar opposite to the point im convinced everyone here is a bot, oh well, i loved the movie at least
Best movie ever.
they really rushed with this movie
Brie Larson was so terrible she got sidelined in her own sequel LOLOL!
Boring cringe movie with cheese thief as the hero.
I was so excited when Carol said &quot;Its Marvellin Time&quot; and Marvelled over the skrulls here. Best movie ever.
marvellous
Captain Marvel is so terrible she&#39;s a supporting character in her own sequel lol
mediocre superhero movie
worst Marvel movie ever made Captain fungus
lol at the fake accounts posting good reviews
fun movie
Boring movie.
love captain marvel
So many trolls posting bad reviews for this fun movie.
So many bots posting great reviews for this boring movie.
Same music use in the ANDOR trailer
Captain Marvel is really marvellous
Captain Marvel is really boring. How did Brie Larson get a acting job with the personality of brick?
This is hands down the best MCU movie. <br><br>Of course trolls and man babies  will troll it up
Imagine having a cringe movie that gets good review comments from phony throw away accounts.
👏
Mid ah movie tbh
Worst Marvel movie.
I can be a waiter in one of marvel movie 🥹🥹🥹🥹
WASP WAS THE FIRST FEMALE AVENGER AND LEADER OF THE AVENGERS....yet you don&#39;t hear Evangeline Lilly complaining about not being the leader of the avengers etc...unlike teyonnah parris who just complains...no wonder Kathryn Hahn is more popular and has her own tv show..even though monica rambeau is the 2nd most used character in wandavision
&lt;when you listen to some of nia da costa&#39;s candyman interviews and even her captain marvel 2 interviews..she is very pro-black ..and didn&#39;t like candyman killing mainly blacks in the original candyman movie..so she course corrected this in her new candyman movie....monica rambeau was originally captain marvel and the 2nd leader of the avengers after WASP  even though most forget that it was wasp not monica rambeau who was the first avenger and first leader too..nia da costa mentioned this a few times in interviews...i believe that it was nias da costa and teyonah parris that changed the title to the marvels...not the mcu or kevin feige....in phase1,2, 3 the mcu controlled everything..but since phase 4 they&#39;ve given all powers to the directors.......&gt;
Put some respect on Carol Danvers. And Monica shouldn&#39;t be sharing a title. How about giving her a solo movie!

Captain Marvel is a DC Comics Character you posers

it was nia dacosta and nia dacosta alone who removed captain marvel from the title to support her black best friend teyonnah parris and the first female captain marvel monica rambeau
love this movie
Clown actress boring movie.
Brie Larson wasn&#39;t stunning and brave enough so she became a supporting character in the sequel.
A movie so bad Marvel needs bots to praise their movie.
Worst Marvel movie made.
Truly one of the movie company&#39;s of all time
Not that great movie
The dude John wick in every single comment defending captain marvel  LOL!!!<br><br>Captain marvel sucks!!!
People have grown tired of Brie Larson&#39;s stupid comments.
Worst Marvel.
Brie Larson is the epitome of cringe and grifting .
Crapton Marvel.
Boring vapid plank of wood.
love brie larson
boring movie with captain plank as the star
&quot;We have no idea what threats are out there&quot; <br><br><b>hits an old lady</b>

Captain Marvel is the epitome of cringe.

thank you Critical Drinker for warning us about this bland movie
Captain cheese queen lamest Marvel movie.
Captain Marvel is a great movie, Make sure u watch captain marvel 2 The Marvels coming to theatres 2023
Stupid girl power movie with Captain plank as the star.
Captain vapid
I was hesitant watching the film but it actually ended up being pretty good, even got me to laugh more than a few times, which is pretty rare for films nowadays. I recommend it!
Movie was so bad Captain Marvel got sidelined in her own sequel.
Dumb kids movie.
Captain Marvel&#39;s powers are just amazing.
Really boring movie Marvel&#39;s biggest mistake.
terrible movie
Brie Larson lied about doing her own stunts
worst superhero movie ever
captain fungus
cry more Steve Vadeboncoeur lol
Captain marvellous the best actress ever.
Captain narcissism the worst actress ever.
One of my favorite Marvel movies
The worst Marvel movie IMO because of the sole focus on feminist doctrine rather than a good superhero movie. <br>Brie Larson doesn&#39;t have the skill as an indie actress to lead big movies.
Captain Karen
No Oasis  ….a band that defined the 90s.
Critical Drinker&#39;s review about Captain Marvel is superb.
Lamest Marvel movie.

Captain Marvel was so vapid she got demoted in the sequel.
Captain Marvel shows Hollywood is not finished pushing out bland uninspiring movies to milk cash from dumb folks.
Needs way more dislike.
Marvel made a terrible mistake hiring this plank of wood to lead their movie.
Vapid lame excuse for a super hero.
love cap marvel
Captain marvellous the best Marvel movie character.
Captain Karen the dumbest Marvel movie character.
...this Lady Actress would be a very - perfect - choice for casting the role of &quot;Lisa Hayes&quot; in a live-action Robotech movie.
I loved this movie so much 😍
Terrible boring movie.

&lt;&lt;brie larson stunts interview before chris hemsworth No, it really all came out of ignorance, to be honest. I didn’t realize that you don’t actually do your own, most people don’t do their own stunts in these movies. I thought you did, and I’ve never been a particularly elegant or athletic person. I’m just an introvert with asthma and felt like I needed to be able to do that. I just thought, “I don’t wanna be on set, and they ask me to do things, and I don’t know how to do it.” So I started training as soon as I could, which was right after I wrapped, so it basically started right as I wrapped picture, I locked picture on the film that I directed. I then went into that, which then turned into nine months of training. And nine months of just training-training, and three months of stunt training with the stunt team. We spent two hours every day, five days a week. And it wasn’t until … everyone just went along with it, and was like, “Cool.” It wasn’t until we started shooting, and I started doing all my own wire work stunts, and flips and stuff that people were like, “You know nobody, now we’ll tell you, nobody actually does this. We just didn’t want you to stop. But now that you’ve kind of accomplished this thing, we don’t normally do this.” And I was like, huh?&gt;&gt;

eternals shows that now in phase 4 the directors have been given full power..unlike in phase 1,2,3 where the mcu kevin feige had full power ..so it was nia dacosta that decided not feige or the mcu....and teyonah is her friend...
when you listen to some of nia da costa&#39;s candyman interviews and even her captain marvel 2 interviews..she is very pro-black ..and didn&#39;t like candyman killing mainly blacks in the original candyman movie..so she course corrected this in her new candyman movie....monica rambeau was originally captain marvel and the 2nd leader of the avengers after WASP  even though most forget that it was wasp not monica rambeau who was the first avenger and first leader too..nia da costa mentioned this a few times in interviews...i believe that it was nias da costa and teyonah parris that changed the title to the marvels...not the mcu or kevin feige....in phase1,2, 3 the mcu controlled everything..but since phase 4 they&#39;ve given all powers to the directors.......

nah i think its cuz direct nia de costa wants this movie to be about teyonah paris&#39; monica rambeau so she doesnt want the title to focus on the white girl
In Marvel mythology, Captain Marvel is the legacy of Mar-vell. Carol was his girlfriend and got her powers straight from him, becoming Ms Marvel. Monica Rambeau had nothing to do with him, and was named CM only for retaining copyright on the name. Carol was the right choice.
it was nia dacosta and nia dacosta alone who removed captain marvel from the title to support her black best friend teyonnah parris and the first female captain marvel monica rambeau
Put some respect on Carol Danvers. And Monica shouldn&#39;t be sharing a title. How about giving her a solo movie!
I call it Captain Marvel 2

Brie Larson is the epitome of sexism and cringe.
Brie Larson is a terrible actress. Captain Marvel is uninspiring feminist tripe.

Captain cringe is the dumbest Marvel movie ever. Seriously made for soy boys and rainbow flag waving weirdos.
I bet she makes an epic sandwich.
Movie was so good Marvel decided to demoted Captain Marvel in the sequel LOLOL!
Greatest movie ever!! /s
Just watched Captain Marvel, I was pals with Brie Larson years ago, just as her career was kicking off. No. she did not snub me, people get busy, busier in her case, you keep in touch less, Yada Yada. Sweetest girl alive,  so talented, well deserved success. Don&#39;t know why it took me so long to watch it, got busy I guess.😁 Not so familiar with a lot of comic book characters. BUt love sci-fi and high fantasy lord of the rings type stuff. Anyway fantastic movie, and unless they used some serious de-aging on Annette Bening, the lady is in fantastic shape for 30, let alone 60. Whole cast is great. Worth a popcorn, cozy night watch.
Captain fungus here to show white men her fungus power.
The Marvel&#39;s was pushed back and the world doesn&#39;t care.
Imagine being demoted in your own sequel LOLOL!!
Marvel&#39;s worst movie ever.
Jesus, Critical Drinker&#39;s review was incredibly accurate.
Lame movie from Captain fungus.
Marvel JTHM.
I&#39;AM HOMELANDERS. JTHM

I remember when the audience clapped and cheered when Captain Marvel destroyed thanos ship and saved all the avengers
Captain Marvel is the best
Captain Marvel was the biggest mistake Marvel made. Really boring Mary Sue Karen.
I remember when the audience clapped and cheered when Thanos sent Captain Karen back to her safe space.
I remember years ago when the Captain Marvel score on Rotten Tomatoes was manipulated <br>to make more people think the movie was a hit when it wasn&#39;t.
I remember when Captain Marvel was avoided by many people and feminist loons like China Teves<br>sitting alone at the movie theater wondering where everyone was.
This is the worst Marvel movie. Girl power cringe fest with a flimsy script.
I still remember years ago when all the zit faced, parent&#39;s basement living virgins were complaining about how Brie Larson didn&#39;t smile enough in the trailers. <br>After watching the movie,  I thought her character smiled a lot. <br>Meanwhile, those same losers don&#39;t complain when the men don&#39;t smile.
Why am I watching old trailers?
This truly is one of those times where I deeply lament the removal of the dislike counter.
Boring  movie
Imagine being playing second fiddle in your own sequel Brie LOL!!!
Marvel&#39;s worst movie with stinky cheese Larson.
Cringe movie with a bland plank of wood as the lead.

I like this movie
A film so good that Captain marvel was written out of her own sequel.
Captain Marvel got demoted in her second movie lol
Captain fungus lol
lol Steve Vadeboncoeur lives at home with his mom
all the fake reviews by new accounts saying this movie is great is from Steve Vadeboncoeur of Quebec Canada
cry more Steve Vadeboncoeur lol
super lame movie made for dumb folks
worst Marvel movie ever
great movie
&lt;&lt;Imagine dedicating this much time hating on someone online. David Smith makes horrible comments on Brie Larson&#39;s channel 24/7 360 days a year using his FAKE accounts . Ironically, Brie Larson never uses any social media 😅 her assistant does all of the posts for her so they are screaming into the void. I kind of feel sorry for these people honestly, Imagine waking up with hate for someone and going to bed with the same feeling and repeating this circle for years.Trolls will say they things they know are not true or that they themselves do not believe in order to upset someone and trigger a response, their main goal is to trigger a response from you, Delusional disorder, previously called paranoid disorder,(Also called David Smith) is a type of serious mental illness — called a “psychosis”— in which a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined. The main feature of this disorder is the presence of delusions, which are unshakable beliefs in something untrue&gt;&gt;
Marvel made a huge mistake making this boring movie. Brie Larson is the epitome of cringe.
a pile of dirt has more personality than Brie Larson
Captain Marvel is the worst Marvel movie
boring movie
needs more dislike
Terrible movie terrible actress cheese queen
Critical Drinker&#39;s review about Captain Marvel is marvelous
Captain Marvel was so bad she got downgraded to a buddy team movie for the second movie
Captain Marvel is a super Karen nobody asked for
Brie Larson is terrible
worst Marvel movie ever made
love this movie
Turf nation Captain Marvel review was accurate.
Critical Drinker&#39;s Captain Marvel review was accurate.
There should be an option to give this two dislike.
Captain Marvel was a mistake.
Cringe dumb movie.
Averages-thanoes deadgame make a flim
great movie
I like how she lands in &quot;blockbusters&quot; movie store ... But NEVER actually makes a block buster movie 😂<br>Nice pun...
disney allowed chris hemsworth to sweet talk the what if writers into saying that captain marvel isn&#39;t worthy of lifting thors hammer even though hela can still lift the hammer......and now disney are going to throw brie larson under the bus again  by allowing scarlet witch to defeat captain marvel maria rambeau easily in dr strange 2 ..when the mcu could have chosen any other characters in the mcu to be part of the illuminati and get defeated by wanda ..sigh..............
ok I&#39;ve just read x-men 4 the first appearance of wanda and her powers were just bad luck...nothing more just the same bad luck powers that black cat from spiderman has or domino from dead pool has.....wanda wasn&#39;t even a witch she was just a mutant and her village called her a witch because of her mutant bad luck power.....she had to be save by magneto ...she was a very weak marvel character......until they retconned her many many times changing her back story etc....basically now she is part jean grey part phoenix part some new witch ....but has complete lost all her original bad luck power...SHE IS A COMPLETELY NEW CHARACTER wearing the same old costume..
og ms marvel vs og wanda.......og ms marvel would kill wanda in seconds 10 out 10 times. easily.....
ok so in dr strange 2, scarlet witch wanda kills captain marvel by dropping a small man-sized statue made of just normal cement on top of Maria rambeau captain marvel ......cap marvel who can fly through space through meteorites huge planet sized meteorites and through huge motherships made of metal ...is killed by a statute made of just cement?????? lol plot armour wanda scarlet witch
&lt;&lt;ok, so I&#39;ve just watched dr strange 2 and wanda doesn&#39;t defeat captain marvel, it&#39;s chthon that defeats captain marvel via the dark hold via wundagore mountain temple....wanda scarlet witch wasn&#39;t born a witch no one is....they are chosen by demons to become witches...in the mcu....but wanda was especially chosen by the chief demon chthon to become his avatar? or special witch? or the scarlet witch.....but her powers are still limited unless she physically has access to the dark hold which acts are a huge power booster or direct access to wundagore temple .....if wanda scarlet witch didn&#39;t have access to the dark hold or wundagore when she fought captain marvel then captain marvel would have won the fight easily.....(think of wanda with the dark hold or in the temple wundagore as the same as x-men jean grey with the phoenix force fully possessing her .....without the phoenix jean grey is still powerful but no way near as powerful...) same with wanda she is still OP ....but without the dark hold or the temple....she is limited....and since the temple or the dark hold was made for her ...she is the only one with full access to it&#39;s power...i.e she can become the avatar or chthon....whereas everyone one else who uses the dark hold cannot...but can just access a limited set of the dark holds power....the only other character in comics that has this type of power from a demon is juggernaut from the x-men...he becomes the full avatar of cytorrak .....but only uses a limited power set...whereas dr strange can not become cytorraks avatar....but can access a limited seat of powers from cytorrak .....MIC DROP.....so....the fight between captain marvel and wanda wasn&#39;t a fair fight at all....she was basically fighting the 3rd most powerful being in all of marvel...behind the one above all, Mephisto, then chthon ...&gt;&gt;
can&#39;t wait for captain marvellous 2
the long kiss goodnight geena Davis but in space
&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.&quot;
loved this movie keep it up marvel
IMO as an indy actress Brie lacks the talent to lead movies. Captain Marvel is a boring Karen.
Cool trailer bad movie , just feeling age of Ultron vibes
most hated marvel movie ever <br>keep it up marvel
Terrible movie.
Captain Karen.
Brie is such a terrible plank of wood the Captain Marvel sequel was renamed.
Terrible plank of wood clown lady in a boring movie.
Brie needs to talk with me it has been 1 year.
I was trying to text Brie, not Carol.

The man who caused her to doubt herself. However, this time his power over her is waning. She starts off getting thrashed by him, however, each time she is knocked down, she grows a little stronger. This time with every insult he throws at her, rather than becoming weaker, she grows stronger. She realizes that he is scared of what she is capable of and she starts responding with psychological attacks on him. She trash-talks him until she is eventually able to overpower him. However, despite winning the fight, she still has that lingering self-doubt. She berates herself for not being able to save everyone. Whilst there are glimpses of that self-confidence,  she cannot get rid of her inner critic. She tells herself that one day, she will make peace with her past, but for now, she has work to do. She has an uncertain smile as she looks towards the horizon and flies off as we fade to end credits. The implication is that her powers are governed by self-belief. She only becomes strong when she believes in herself. In a sequel, she could have an excess of self-belief causing her to be reckless and make mistakes. However, this would be when she is at her most powerful. However, this excess in self-belief is the result of her overcompensating for her insecurities. So the sequel would be about her opening up about her insecurities and finding a healthy balance.
A couple of things I would have liked with Captain Marvel. No amnesia. Instead, have her struggle with self-esteem. Now in this version, her powers would work off her own self-belief. Throughout the first act, she cannot harness her powers. So she has to rely on other skills for now. Marksmanship, thinking outside the box and trying to outwit her foes. She does okay in other areas, but even here, she doubts herself. Her self-doubt leads to the death of one of her fellow soldiers. She is an obsessive perfectionist but has a plethora of mistakes. She is not spontaneous and relies heavily on plans, when those plans go awry, she doubles down on the negative self-talk. Then in the middle of the film, we get some flashbacks via nightmares that reveal where this lack of self-belief comes from. This is where the main villain of the film is introduced. This villain does all your usual villainous stuff, however, the key is that they have a personal connection to Captain Marvel. She then finds out that he is behind all the bad stuff that has happened in the film so far. She has to confront him, but she is terrified of him. The second and third acts are dedicated to her slowly building her confidence and discovering her power. She faces her fears.
&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.&quot;
Actually the message of the film is opposite. The Kree Empire tried to convince Vers that emotions are weakness, intellect is strength and they are right and worth fighting for. At first they wanted to make her completely fanatic. Because of the amnesia and gratefulness for life rescuing, Yonn-Rogg was everything for her: mentor, commander, friend. But than it turned out that the empire is an evil that wants to commit genocide. Carol needed to free herself from imperial zombiefication and to oppose her friend. And she defeated him not because of her superpowers. She won thanks to her stubbornness and strength of will, which is rooted in emotions and values. I don&#39;t know how it was possible to watch the film to miss the development of the heroine from wannabe blind fanatic to normal independent person together with it&#39;s anti-colonial message.
Captain Marvel has flaws and people say she’s an awful arrogant harpy witch. When she doesn’t have flaws, people say she’s boring and a Mary Sue. Are people seriously still saying Carol had no flaws (did they even watch the movie or read her comics?) and unironically use the term “Mary Sue” in 2022? Cringe.
I think captain marvel had some flaws. Like she followed the kree without realising all of their crimes. Being too cold and emotionless was probably also meant as a flaw
I&#39;m so mad the sequel of captain marvel got delayed again!!! So im here watching the trailer of captain marvel. I need CAROL NOW😭WE HAVEN&#39;T SEEN HER SINCE ENDGAME BRUH

Silly feminist movie with a script so mundane it was probably scribbled on a napkin.
Clown feminist makes bad movies. Critical Drinker was right Brie is a plank of wood.
Critical Drinker was right this plank of wood is boring.
Boring girl power hero movie. Plot is underwhelming feminist tripe.
Dumbest Marvel I ever seen. Brie Larson literally had the same facial expression the entire movie.
Imagine being cancelled by your own fans on Twitter.
Captain Marvel is so cringe she had less than 20 minutes of screen time in Avengers Endgame.
Captain Marvel is so great Marvel dropped her name from the sequel LOL!!!
Lame movie made for people with low standards.
love love loved captain marvel great movie
it&#39;s the long kiss goodnight geena Davis but in space

can&#39;t wait for captain marvellous 2
love love loved captain marvel great movie
We should’ve just gotten a chronologically told Captain Marvel origin story with many of the same elements, it would’ve been so much better
Well, I&#39;ve finally seen it now, it&#39;s really not good.<br><br>Some of their CGI physics are about as bad as I might expect from an old 80s video game, though not the worst I&#39;ve seen in a big budget movie, funny how CGI actually seems to be getting worse rather than better, but that&#39;s far from its only problems, there are TV series in the MCU  better in almost every way and this is supposed to be a big budget movie, glad I never wasted any money going to see this in the cinema.<br><br>Not a great addition to the MCU, very little I enjoyed here.
Captain Marvel is the rey “Skywalker” for the MCU
Captain Marvel was a good movie. I like it!<br>Not the best or anything, but still pretty cool!
Thật sự là mình rất thích âm nhạc những năm trước đây hơn là những bài hát hot hit hiện giờ. Kèm theo giọng hát của Đức Phúc thì ôi trời siêu hay luôn
marvel push her in the comics, but not on tv, cartoons...videogames.......
we need a cap marvel animated movie
we need a cap marvel video game
we need an animated captain marvel series
they should retcon cap marvels powers in cap marvel 3 and make her more like the silver surfer because at the moment she only has 7 powers, strength, cosmic forcefield, energy absorption and photon blasts, flight, and a cosmic awareness?......she should be able to use her cosmic powers to telekinetically move objects, heal planets etc...time travel,  cosmic is versatile.......

they are going to put maria rambeau in a james brown wig again and dress her up as captain marvel, then get wanda to kill her easily........in dr strange 2 and the wandavision of madeness
Terrible plank of wood feminist.
The movie was alright. I know that Brie can do better with a better script. If they re-arranged the scenes, there would have been more growth and plot and tension.
Watched this today for the first time.. <br>    ..a completely rewritten origin story, rewritten supporting characters, rewritten character, rewritten “universe”😉where everything else is the same 🤣<br>  viewers who have love and empathy for all living things and want peace above all  ..yet stay silent in the ultra violence of the Nazi Empire embedded in the origins of Steve Rogers and Bucky..🤭
Lucifer the fallen angel
stupid feminist in a stupid feminist movie
Anyone want to test me again please do not test my nerves
Piece of crap feminist action movie. 💩
The book the outsider
There&#39;s only ONE reason this film was SO HYPED and made SO much money....<br><br><br><br><br><br>people were releasing their hype for Avengers Endgame on this
I thought this movie was good until the second half Felt like the Superhero hero equivalent of &quot;The Room&quot; Absolute Garbage Except the fact i couldn&#39;t laugh this time
garbage
Looks like Marvel is greater than America.
Really boring girl power movie with nothing else going for it.
I fell asleep watching this movie.
The worst Marvel movie ever made. Brie Larson is a terrible actress and annoying.
&lt;&lt;Christian Bale Says Hollywood (and the World) Would Be Better If ‘White Dudes’ Weren’t in Charge of Everything The actor says there would be &quot;so much better films and so much more interesting stories&quot; if white dudes weren&#39;t running Hollywood. Zack Sharf Dec 19, 2017&gt;&gt;
brie larson stunts interview No, it really all came out of ignorance, to be honest. I didn’t realize that you don’t actually do your own, most people don’t do their own stunts in these movies. I thought you did, and I’ve never been a particularly elegant or athletic person. I’m just an introvert with asthma and felt like I needed to be able to do that. I just thought, “I don’t wanna be on set, and they ask me to do things, and I don’t know how to do it.” So I started training as soon as I could, which was right after I wrapped, so it basically started right as I wrapped picture, I locked picture on the film that I directed. I then went into that, which then turned into nine months of training. And nine months of just training-training, and three months of stunt training with the stunt team. We spent two hours every day, five days a week. And it wasn’t until … everyone just went along with it, and was like, “Cool.” It wasn’t until we started shooting, and I started doing all my own wire work stunts, and flips and stuff that people were like, “You know nobody, now we’ll tell you, nobody actually does this. We just didn’t want you to stop. But now that you’ve kind of accomplished this thing, we don’t normally do this.” And I was like, huh?
&quot;Our culture will be so much richer the day that we stop saying, ‘Hey, it’s all white dudes who are running things,&#39;” Christian Bale said. “Whether that be Hollywood, whether that be Washington, you know. We’re going to get, in Hollywood, so much better films and so much more interesting stories being told and America will become the America that the rest of the world sees it as, that makes it unique…that we recognize makes this such a beautiful, brilliant country&quot;
&lt;&lt;Christian Bale has had enough of “white guys” running everything in Hollywood and beyond. The actor stopped by AOL Build with his “Hostiles” co-star Rosamund Pike and Wes Studi on December 18 and told the crowd that the reason he moved to the U.S. in the first place was because he wanted his kids to grow up in a “country of inclusion.” Unfortunately, that ideal hasn’t been too much of a reality &gt;&gt;

Next Year She Arrives Back Again To The Big Screen Can&#39;t Wait!
I&#39;m late but I&#39;m here now is time to see this i know that marvel always delivers the neve fail
marvel trailers can make you cry happy tears
Super cringy feminist action drama with uninspiring plank acting from Brie Larson. <br>Captain Marvel is truly the worst Marvel movie I have ever experienced with the ridiculously mundane<br>writing and poor casting decisions. Seriously folks don&#39;t waste a penny on watching Captain Marvel it&#39;s a waste of time.
Thor stomps Captain Marvel, Wanda stomps her Doctor Strange stomps her, Dormammu inhales and absorbs her (although it would serve no purpose), Living Tribunal blows her away with the force of his whistle, Thanos with Infinity Gauntlet flicks her away with his pinky finger, Odin stomps her, Ancient One gifts her an Early death, Ego eats her, Celestial Star Lord blasts her.<br><br>I can also stomp her. Every captain marvel haters can also stomp her.
I HATE THIS ACTERE 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Boring feminist girl power movie catering to weirdos.
When you make a character too powerful they lose humanity. You don&#39;t feel them. Their loss, struggle, victories. Captain Marvel isn&#39;t a very fleshed out character. She basically is a cocky narcissistic weapon who brags about being the strongest even though she got like 10 minutes of total screentime. Poorly written character.
FAKE! The real Captain Marvel says &quot;SHAZAM!&quot;
The only marvel movie I didn’t watch
This movie sucked
This movies was nothing but a  trash to be honest. I want to see a dedicated movie on thenos life. Like dc did to joker . and marvel doing to loki. We&#39;re loving those characters very much.
The epitome of feminist cringe and uninspiring Mary Sue adventures.
I love the women superheroes they’re so cool
Captain marvel movie story is the worst in mcu i hope they fix it in the marvels
Cringe feminist action movie for soy boys and raging wahmen.
Every marvel movie will entertain us for sure
Bland uninspiring feminist movie.
cool
lol wonder woman 1984 kowtowed to the mob and agreed to all their demands by smiling a lot and wearing revealing mini skirts and low cut blouses that reveal her breasts but they still hated her lol ..and her movie flopped ...these hypocrites will still hate women even if women do exactly as they ask of them

In Marvel mythology, Captain Marvel is the legacy of Mar-vell. Carol was his girlfriend and got her powers straight from him, becoming Ms Marvel. Monica Rambeau had nothing to do with him, and was named CM only for retaining copyright on the name. Carol was the right choice.
&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 years already!
For me there’s Billy Batson (Captain Marvel/Shazam) this hero is older than most comics. It’s a pity comic book industry don’t show him a proper respect ✊
This Movie is so Over-hated
A floating plank of wood had more personality than Brie Larson. This clown feminist needs to be cancelled
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 classic
Svae Daredevil
I was going to watch it, but Brie said it’s not for White men. If White men don’t watch a superhero movie, who will? I guess she didn’t really think that part through.
104K Dislikes... Finally, faith in humanity is restored!
&lt;Brie Larson likes to masquerade as a champion for equality, but doesn&#39;t actually do anything to help people. <br>  Brie endorses BLM and racial injustice, but Brie donates her money to racist Margaret Sanger&#39;s eugenics program <br>  called Planned. Parenthood. Brie Larson also white washed Captain Marvel.&gt;
Although this wasn&#39;t my favourite Marvel movie, I stil loved that Stan Lee tribute and the way it set up endgame and Brie Larson was good as Captain Marvel
finally i found this movie
It just came to my mind while watching this movie, I mean how the hell did she landed at the exact location in the whole wide world where she used to live in the past lol.
Looking back at this, this movie was sitll garbage.
Filler movie
Boring woman makes a feminist movie.

Worst Marvel character.
Cancel this clown.

AMAZING MOVIE I CANT WAIT FOR CAPTAIN MARVEL 2
Good movie
I don’t care what anyone says I thought this movie was pretty good. Brie Larson is alright and her acting could’ve been better but the movie overall was good
&lt;This film promotes feminist nonsense about a patriarchy and the film also was <br>   used by the U.S. Air Force a a recruitment tool targeting women.<br>   Brie Larson had no problem cashing even though many women have been abused serving in the U.S. Air Force.&gt;
This movie was crap🤮
dc has gal gadot and marvel has brie larson. Brie larson is marvel&#39;s worst actor choice. Prove me wrong...
Weost movie of marvel , I fell sleep while watching this 🗑
Boring and Overrated! Shazam! was 100 times better.
She doesn’t loo like super hero
we love you brie larson
More like captain marvellous
More like captain feminism
&lt;Brie Larson regularly donates to Planned Parenthood, which is an eugenics program<br>  started by racist Margaret Sanger financed by The Rockefeller Foundation.<br>  Feminists like abortion because they consider children unnecessary baggage.&gt;
I can&#39;t believe they got Abed&#39;s girlfriend to be in this.
brie larson as captain marvel is just perfect
YESS MOMMY. YES. YES. OMG IN QUIVERING PLS KICK ME
Awesome Movie
What makes a hero? Apparently just superpowers.
We get it women are stronger.
You&#39;re a twin.
You have to find someone to marry eventually. I&#39;ll find you in a second.
I have to remove you from the Justice League. The Justice League is not everything. I Told you Tyler is only an Angel.
Is this seriously the official trailer??? Lol why is it so bad it&#39;s a mess ://
The more I say this movie was good, the less sexist I am.
Crap feminist movie.
I thought this movie was okay but I think they should have gotten a different actress for Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. I just don’t find Brie Larson’s performance all that charismatic and interesting at all.
“Regan I don’t think it’s working”
i don&#39;t like it
wow cool music
Yeah Geralt did it, But he Will be murdered also. It is a Law we áre Catholics.
Yeah that is how our Physiology is. If You rehect an actual Theory the Theory You rehect, or Theories You reject affect You instantly.
Supermans, and Supergirls biology is able to isolated, But unfortantely it is an actual Theory.
Yeah that is actual Theory.
If he is jailed he is never able to break out of jail, or be released from the jail. It is an actual Theory.
Also while a person is using vídeo Games that person is not able to be legally hurt. It is litterally an actual Theory also. That is how stupid all of those people áre.
A person with downsyndrome is basically operating WMDs, is what is happening. I&#39;am actually fighting a person with Downsyndrome that is rejecting actual Theory.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=107">1:47</a> Wow what INCREDIBLE IS THAT
That reminder me a new marvel studios movies on Disney plus original with the eternals and Thor 4 love,thunder 2022.
Still the best superhero movie ever made
loved this movie
One of the BEST comic book movies I&#39;ve seen.
One of the worst comic book movies I&#39;ve seen.<br>Sole focus on feminism without any bother to include great writing and character development. <br>Whole film is a feminist brainwashing tool.
What was the point of a Captain Marvel solo movie? She didn&#39;t even play a big part in Infinity War and Endgame, seriously.
coming from 2022
cool
I LOVE THIS MOVIE
Still the best superhero movie ever made... The best thing was how captain marvellous looked
I remember loving this film and then went to the internet only for it to get a lot of hate
Still the worst superhero movie ever made... The best thing was how Fury look
The Game is not supposed to be distributed. It is litterally that they have to purchase the Smite Game link. All Games áre only links.
It is litterally real. The tickets áre for your Soldiers, if You have only have a few tickets their for your personal Deployment.
Do not distribuye My Mobile Legends Game it is our family and Friends Game. It is aparte of Smite. People make their own equipment. &quot;Character&quot;. Stop hijacking My network. You own Star Labs.
Not a fib I actually blocked him. We have a massive Siege happening. You have to try to do RuneScape Quests to help Commoners, and learn. The Quests áre repeatable because they occurs more than once in life. It is a terrible fact. A person only needs to do the Quests once. Reminder term is not Nerds.
Yeah Odin is trying to Bombard My Space Force Stations.
Yeah that is all Real. You áre supposed to use Europe.EE.UU in every Game. It is litterally You, and all your stuff in the Game. You litterally earn all that stuff. Also vídeo Games áre for Military only. People actually die.
Odin is the enemy Thor is stranded on Earth. I blocked their teleportation. Mobile Legends, is the battle ground, and Smite, and RuneScape, and Albion, and Arena of Valor. Yeah RuneScape is real, links to the Bifrost core we&#39;re conquered not far in past. God of War Video Game. Video Games áre Dimensional, But SO is Ever other Dimensión Linked to the Bifrost. All those exist for a reason. It is Theory.
All i still think about is, what is the deal with this cat? XD
One of my fav movies! Can’t wait for her second movie 🦸🏼‍♀️💥
Goose was the best thing about this garbage heap of a movie.
These inherent character flaws allow Larson to do a lot of heavy emotional lifting, especially when Carol returns home to Earth after spending time in space with the elite Kree military team Starforce. Unsure of her identity, Carol questions her past and herself, all while trying to grapple with her conflicting identities. It&#39;s meaty stuff for a superhero film, and one that Larson seems more than up to the challenge to tackle.
&quot;That is something that is really exciting to me about this film: We did not cut corners on that stuff. Like, when it&#39;s funny, it is funny, but also when there&#39;s deep emotional things happening, it&#39;s real. So I was able to bring some of those same things that I&#39;ve brought to full dramatic roles into this, which I&#39;m really proud of because I think it will really set this film apart.&quot;
But it&#39;s the part-Kree, part-human detail that sticks out here. In the comics, Carol Danvers gains her powers when her DNA accidentally fuses with a Kree hero known as Mar-Vell, aka the first Captain Marvel. So in a sense, she&#39;s always been part-alien, but it seems like Captain Marvel will be leaning heavily into this dichotomy. The emotional, impulsive side of humans would always be difficult to reconcile with the nature of a logical alien race, but Carol Danvers has even poorer impulse control. Which is what makes her such a fascinating superhero.
&quot;You have this Kree part of her that&#39;s unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then there&#39;s this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It&#39;s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it&#39;s also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her her.&quot;
In the upcoming Marvel film Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers is a part-Kree, part-human warrior with the powers of a god — though she won&#39;t likely act like one. Instead, it&#39;s her human side that best categorizes her: aggressive, impulsive, and hotheaded. She&#39;s got &quot;two sides warring against each other,&quot;
Captain Marvel&#39;s titular hero is a new kind of superhero. Not just because Brie Larson&#39;s Carol Danvers is the first solo female hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But because she&#39;s angry. And because she may not be fully human.
i like don’t like her and i don’t know why i watched captain marvel and couldn’t enjoy it i feel like that character should be this badass witty woman and not to put her down but i don’t think she delivers the character well i feel like none of her lines had any real power not bc of the story or writing but bc of the delivery she didn’t really show much emotion or depth to me she made the character feel very 2d and the whole movie came of to me as someone reading lines off a page i think Samuel completely saved the movie for me and made it so much more enjoyable i feel like monica’s character had more depth than brie’s idk does anyone agree with me if not can we please talk about it bc i really don’t want to dislike her lol but she just felt very forced to me
the most talked about movie in history
a nice movie
Perhaps a nice movie, but this trailer sucks, sorry....
WASP WAS THE FIRST FEMALE AVENGER AND LEADER OF THE AVENGERS....yet you don&#39;t hear Evangeline Lilly complaining about not being the leader of the avengers etc...unlike teyonnah parris who just complains...no wonder Kathryn Hahn is more popular and has her own tv show..even though monica rambeau is the 2nd most used character in wandavision
when you listen to some of nia da costa&#39;s candyman interviews and even her captain marvel 2 interviews..she is very pro-black ..and didn&#39;t like candyman killing mainly blacks in the original candyman movie..so she course corrected this in her new candyman movie....monica rambeau was originally captain marvel and the 2nd leader of the avengers after WASP  even though most forget that it was wasp not monica rambeau who was the first avenger and first leader too..nia da costa mentioned this a few times in interviews...i believe that it was nias da costa and teyonah parris that changed the title to the marvels...not the mcu or kevin feige....in phase1,2, 3 the mcu controlled everything..but since phase 4 they&#39;ve given all powers to the directors.......
the title change from captain marvel 2 the marvel to just the marvels was 100% nia da costa&#39;s idea not the mcu or kevin feige or marvel or disney.....it was all nia dacosta ..and since phase 4 kevin feige has given full power to the directors of the movies unlike phase 1 to 3 where he withheld the full control from the directors
nia da costa is very pro black and since monica rambeau was the first female captain marvel in the comics and is cannon as she said on the tedd lasso interview with Brett Goldstein multiple times... she nia dacosta used her opportunity as the director of captain marvel 2 to strip captain marvel off the the title of the movie and just call it the marvels... instead of calling it &#39;captain marvel 2 the marvels&#39; The one thing nia dacosta seems to forget is that wasp from ant man was the first avenger in the comics and the first leader of the avengers...yet Evangeline Lilly  has never complained that she should have rightly been the leader of the avengers instead of iron man and captain america rightfully so....and that this is cannon...cannon as nia da costa seems to be obsessed with....Put some respect on Carol Danvers. And Monica shouldn&#39;t be sharing a title. How about giving her a solo movie!
nah i think its cuz direct nia de costa wants this movie to be about teyonah paris&#39; monica rambeau so she doesnt want the title to focus on the white girl
I call it Captain Marvel 2
Put some respect on Carol Danvers. And Monica shouldn&#39;t be sharing a title. How about giving her a solo movie!
a good movie.
Not a good movie.
Casey O’Neill is Tom Cruise’s stunt double and takes over for the actor when<br> something becomes a bit too risky for the veteran star to attempt.
Even in his fifties, Tom Cruise continues to wow audiences by doing dangerous stunts. Still, he doesn’t go “all the way” in many cases; he does have a stunt double, whom he has worked with on several major action films including Jack Reacher and Knight and Day. Casey O’Neill is Cruise’s stunt double and takes over for the actor when something becomes a bit too risky for the veteran star to attempt.
&lt;&lt;brie larson stunts interview before chris hemsworth No, it really all came out of ignorance, to be honest. I didn’t realize that you don’t actually do your own, most people don’t do their own stunts in these movies. I thought you did, and I’ve never been a particularly elegant or athletic person. I’m just an introvert with asthma and felt like I needed to be able to do that. I just thought, “I don’t wanna be on set, and they ask me to do things, and I don’t know how to do it.” So I started training as soon as I could, which was right after I wrapped, so it basically started right as I wrapped picture, I locked picture on the film that I directed. I then went into that, which then turned into nine months of training. And nine months of just training-training, and three months of stunt training with the stunt team. We spent two hours every day, five days a week. And it wasn’t until … everyone just went along with it, and was like, “Cool.” It wasn’t until we started shooting, and I started doing all my own wire work stunts, and flips and stuff that people were like, “You know nobody, now we’ll tell you, nobody actually does this. We just didn’t want you to stop. But now that you’ve kind of accomplished this thing, we don’t normally do this.” And I was like, huh?&gt;&gt;

Have you ever read a movie review and felt like it completely missed the point (and the magic!) of a film you love? Brie Larson apparently has, and is offering a tangible, achievable solution to these misguided reviews: a more diverse pool of film critics. At the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, Brie spoke about the importance of greater representation in criticism, which would hopefully lead to increased representation in the films themselves.

&lt;martin luther king junior &quot;There comes a time when silence is betrayal.&quot;&gt;
&lt;You think she came up with this concept but that&#39;s not the case. If you go on wiki under &quot;african american cinema&quot; and read the first sentence, it says &quot;made for&quot;. Hate the game, not the player.&gt;
A Wrinkle in Time was a film that&#39;s target audience was NOT 40 yr old white dudes. The press who got to review that film leaned heavily in that demographic. A balanced field of journalists would have gotten a variety of eyes on that film. Resulting in the target audience&#39;s perspective reaching the public. Brie Larson only made a rude comment, if you take a clip out of context and ignore the whole point of her speech
To say anyone doesn&#39;t have a right to an opinion because the color of their skin is abhorrent. Good thing Brie didn&#39;t say white males don&#39;t have the right to an opinion because of the colour of their skin. She cited statistics and shared her opinion. Which she&#39;s entitled to too. That opinion being when she stated what she doesn&#39;t need. And what she doesn&#39;t need being a 40 yr old white dude to tell her what didn&#39;t work for him about a Wrinkle in time, over a critic from the intended target demographic of the film.<br><br>Its cool that you enjoyed A Wrinkle in Time. That film directed by Ava DuVernay may have been accessible to you but was not made FOR you. She had teens in mind before you. She had females in mind before you. She had black viewers in mind, before you. (I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re white). None of this takes away from your enjoyment. Just saying that films are made for non white male audiences too and that they should be covered by a field of non white males that is proportionate to the general population. Check out the whole thing dude. She mentions everything you would want to hear from her.
&lt;&lt;Scarlet Witch is a glass cannon, a glass cannon refers to a character that has remarkable offensive abilities with terrible defense. Wanda’s powers are far beyond than most but at the same time she can be killed by just a random civilian with a gun.&gt;&gt;

I said all the Psychology Legal terms. Their not all Sophisticated Long words. War crime. She is actually getting zombies thrown at her. She disobeyed an actual theory. It is a Military law. The Zombies actually follow her. And I almost forgot. And reminder everyone dies allegedly after 10 years of litterally food poisoning world wide. Yeah an estimate of 10 years apart per zombie apocalypse. The one in McAllen everyone I rescued was in 1988. And then I commited Suicide because my wife killed, your mother, and then my girlfriend was murdered, Zeus mother. And then vampires tried to kill Sarah Micheal Guller my friend. Vampires have been around since Castilevania, and then my sister ran away from home. She is known as Retrogirl allegedly. If I&#39;am correct.
Stupid feminist movie. Brie Larson is unattractive and terrible at acting.
Henry is allegedly trying to hold onto all of you. They broadcasted it on tbe Tv series.
Yes It is your Duty, The Zombie Apocalyse is not going to stop. And I told the United Nations the laws pertaining to melissa, and Henry. Because their criminals during a zombie apocalypse they have to throw zombies at them until they die.
Are you going to kill Melissa yet? It is litterally your family duty to kill a family member than commits crimes. Your Fists allegedly destroy Supermans, and Supergirls.
We need to evacuate the people with black hair. They are capable of becoming ZODs.
Call Daniel Hernandez my brother, and Leomord who is Kylo Ren my brother.
Sarah Micheal Guller is from McAllen, Texas she is already fighting zombies.
When a Elder person is holding onto someone mentally they cannot do anything the elder does not want the person to do.
I set the Raccoon city movie that released recently to record automatically if the event happened antwhere around the world. Ask Ashley who is Cortana, she has a List of Movies that automatically record. Haliey my daughter survived The Last Scout event movie.
Brie There is a Zombie Horde Starting. All U.N.S.C, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents! Zombie horde!
The Droid of the U.S.S.Discovery has a locking mechanic built in to lock the space ship from actually doing that.
@S.H.I.E.L.D. I need help. The people of the Space Force ship U.S.S.D.I.S.C.O.V.E.R.Y. are trying to rape me.
My name was Roman Emperor Fernandan III.
Call Tyler. Henry Cavil is litterally a Mental Retard by Medical status, Unitl Tyler is able to get him the surgery. I wrote it in a book that Tyler has. Yeah your going to have to help Tyler, and the others to get the eye out. Not my eyes. Reminder my actual Title is Roman Emperor Dante VI Britannia, I&#39;am Registered as Prince Alucard Lockhart. I allowed my brother Roman Emperor Leomord to Inherit the Throne.
Yeah Geralt is allegedly healthy now. But Henry is actually crazy. He cabnot control his mentallity. I already talked with Tyler about it. Geralts side of the family have to cut one of their eyes out each time their born.
Allegedly I thought it would be Tyler, but it is Geralts side of the family.
Tyler son was thought to look like him and be similar in facial features and that he would hold the same name as Tyler the Second.
Geralt is not Henry. It is family Hypnosis for Henry to say his name is Henry. Geralt is Geralt he was in the past. It is litterally in the Superman series.
go woke go broke
Trash movie.
Worst casting choice, Emely Blunt would have turned perfect captain Marvel.
Henry is your Nefiew, Rudy is Zeus I helped him Create Themescera.
You have to Always travel with one of your brothers.
Carol VI Britannia, Brie VI Britannia, you have to protect your sister machenzie
Actually he Raped Four Princess.
Black Alert on Henry Cavil, crime is he raped a Princess.
Star Labs is under your Princess Crown of management, but it belongs to me. You best know how to manage Your Staff, or kill them. CSI law is not greater than Military law. I already Mentioned this. I already mentioned this also I cannot be interrupted while, Texting, or Speaking.
It is the law.
I need your help, Henry is fighting, and raping a Princess.
Henry Took a woman to Space X
Crappy feminist movie.
Yup, feminist propaganda didn&#39;t age well.
👎
It has you as the AI dummy, or your sister for that ship.
Yes the<br>Spaceship the Legends of Tomorrow use also., actually I think that ship is yours, or your sister, Strike Force her ship.
I control all the ships. I gifted Tyler The Andromeda, I think it was Dillian.
Your not dumb like cara, she is actually a criminal. Her crime is actually Manslaughter.
Your mother is on a ship above me.
I&#39;am able to help build you one, or let you lead a new Cruiser. Your my daughter stupid.
Do you want your ship? Captain.
Ask Cortana to Lock Star Labs, and get those people off my ship, and out of Star Labs.
Strike Force, Captain Marvel, no fire blasts. It explodes instantly allegedly. Need support for The Boys, and Minutemen. Team Supergirl, and Team Speedsters turned traitor. The reactor belongs to me. I created Guideon, and Star Labs, and the Ships.
No burning I think the Green symbiotes are able to absorb it. And do not forget, anything you shoot at causes an instant Death by Supernova with your fist. No one is actually able to absorb it, except me. They all die instantly.
Humanity is dead and polarizing partisan politics, populism, and authoritarianism killed it.
great movie!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=88">1:28</a> it doesn’t work like that lol, when we Spell a Hero we say He-ro not Her-o.
I saw this movie on Blu Ray on Thanksgiving
I ❤️ Captain marvel
This is one of my favorite MCU movies
I feel as if I want to cry.
I time travel.
She is the woman in white armor.
Get here now do not use a hologram bring your sisters. Your mother is here.
&lt;Boring Mary Sue based on Kelly Sue DeConnick&#39;s rubbish boring comics.<br>It&#39;s amusing that people actually believe Disney&#39;s false sales numbers when the Carol<br>Danvers comics poorly.&gt;
Great example of how to give away the ending of a movie within the second scene in the most ham-handed attempt at &quot;foreshadowing&quot; ever contrived.<br><br>Also, GREAT moral: follow your feelings regardless of fact or logic.<br><br>I am sure that could never lead to anything like attempting to overthrow the government over claims of election fraud that isn&#39;t supported by any facts or logic...or something...
Didn&#39;t like the movie much but I love brie Larson
Stan Lee passed away while the film was being edited. As a result, Marvel Studios put together the special opening logo to honor him.<br><br>(at around 37 mins) Samuel L. Jackson improvised checking out the Skrull&#39;s junk beneath the sheet.<br><br>Brie Larson is allergic to cats, so her scenes involving Goose were filmed with a puppet or computer-generated VFX.<br><br>Goose is played by four different very professional cat actors named Reggie, Gonzo, Archie, and Rizzo.<br><br>Project PEGASUS stands for &quot;Potential Energy Group/Alternate Sources/United States.&quot; It was previously mentioned in The Avengers (2012).<br><br>The name &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; is never spoken in the film, and is not seen in print until the closing credits. The name is said by Spider-Man in Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019).<br><br>This film is set in the 1990s, and serves as a prequel tale for established Marvel Cinematic Universe characters Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, Korath the Pursuer, and Ronan the Accuser.<br><br>The filmmakers cited 1990s action movies as an influence on the film&#39;s action, in keeping with the era in which the film is set.<br><br>The film takes place in 1995.<br><br>Keanu Reeves was almost cast as Yon-Rogg.<br><br>In the film the plane crash is said to have taken place in 1989, which is the same year that Brie Larson was born<br><br>Ryan Fleck worked at Blockbuster Video in 1995.<br><br>When portraying the alien Skrull Talos, Ben Mendelsohn used his native Australian accent. When Talos adopts a human disguise, Mendelsohn used an American accent<br><br>The security guard Captain Marvel speaks to at the beginning of the movie is Marvel security director Barry Curtis.<br><br><br>The entire purpose of the opening dream imagery was to set up the mystery involving Vers&#39; past and her connection with Dr. Wendy Lawson.<br><br>This is the second movie to feature Samuel L. Jackson helping an amnesiac woman to discover her past. The first is The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996).
I said that you and your sisters are actual princess. You have other sisters related to you in. Nietherlands, or Siwitzerland that are your age. I was Married to the Queen, of one of those Nations. She is litterally 35 years of age in todays time. Geralt has only been to Spain allegedly.
Thay is why I created the Psychology work that Tyler, and my Brother Dr. Rudy Rodriguez Zeus evaulated.
The Wokest movie...
This trailer was 3 years ago. God I feel old
Red Alert.
All UñSC Red Alert.
Need an immediate deployment of spartans. Bring ships to this area.
All UñSC. They are slapping me with a condom on my face.
Demotion of Marvel, my daughter.
Stop attacking me all day. And my dqughters are not Daniel, or Evans daughters. The UñSC is real. Stop offending.
All UñSC i need a deployment to McAllen, Texas. They are commiting crimes in my area.
I do not know why he is here during our family stiuation against the Flash. My name is actually Prince Dante VI Britannia. Alucard is to ask for my card and to allow an actual transaction, or deal to happen, Dracula was a hate crime against my twin brother, who was a vampire his actual name is Virgil.
Legally by Television laws Thor is already married.
She was attacked right now. I&#39;am moments from notifing the UñSC.
Dislike Buttom
Since when is captain marvel a woman?
Those are actual psychology disasters she is going through mentally.
Also women who wear pink, and say their an individual are usually raped...
And no.
It is actual physics. Your dying.
The man will then feel normal, and continue life, usually they say it is a miracle that the man recovers from an illness.
As soon as the psychology chemistry is fully complete the woman will all be dead of natural causes it usually occurs instantly without a sign of a struggle.
And your sisters do too.
By the way the more you use your power by the time I&#39;m 30 you start to die, because I&#39;am and was sexually deprived.
Worst piece of crap movie the MCU has ever made. Brie Larson SUCKS as Captain Marvel.
Rubbish feminist propaganda film based on Kelly Sue DeConnick&#39;s comics.
30 men demotes you to average civilian of the 21st century. You cannot be a super hero, or a military officer.

Kill her, a car is a Space ship we are only fueling the cars so they have potential to fly if we need the cars to fly. Manufactures are not suppised to create so many cars. The older the better. That is why the steering wheel is able to move up, and down, and it has a rotation, with pedals. Litterslly like Men in Black vehicles. All of the Cars. They&#39;re messing eith reality, and she is commiting an attemoted homocide. I own teo Lamborghinis, thst are alsi spaceships, they can vamporize you also, if need be. They are trsnsformers. The trsnsformers st cyberton are a saftey agsinst kryptonians and other dangers that attack the laws of physics they go Vampire hu ting all the time in other cities. They have kill affermatives to kill vampires. Zombies have a possiblity of becoming ZODs to live again. Your a fresking Princess, your sister has lost her Tiara by law. They announced it.

Yes I know. Gundams. My Gundam is Gundam Freedom.
I&#39;m here to crush the patriarchy by making sandwiches.
I did not know it wouls be this way. The reason you proposed to me is because I&#39;am to marry the woman related to the woman who homocide attempted on me. By law of Psychology. Except you are my actual daughter, and family law is I cannot marry my daughter.
The Flash is not more power than my ships. His entire biology is known to be because I invented Nimbus.
I&#39;am empowering the entire ships.
Slyfer.
Then realize you, are actually related to me. You are my actual Daughter.
Imagine earth, then imagine a Supergiant Sun.
I&#39;am every Sun in every galaxy everywhere.

I told you yesterday. And I told you right now to get to safety. Dayquil is a medication to subside the zombie disease.
I&#39;m infected. Vampirsm, and zombie disease. The speedster tried to feed me a vampire his hand that I cut off a vampire.
Two, or three of your sisters that you have not met are 24 years of age estimate.
I thi k Iannelli got pregnate, and she had children, and I think Alejandra, and I have a daughter also, so 7 sisters.
You have four, or six other sisters. Cortana is your sister. I care very much, now get to safety.
I died In the past.
Cara is infected she was actually playing with a vsmpires hand who was infected with zombie disease.
You are not a Vampire. Do not get infected run away.
And Cara is a criminal.
Your my daughter stsy away from Daniel, and Evan. Daniel was infected by a vampire when I was a boy. He believes he has blood moon as a Super power. He is slightly my brother, but that is why we stay away from each other.
If cara is lying about me being her father, and hypnotized me, then her entering my home and running to me instantly lands her in a Marrige status with me by Marriage laws. But I do not want to be with her. And I will actually kill her.
It is illegal for her to enter my home. I will actually hurt her.
Your sister is here again, get her away from me.

My second favorite superhero movie (right after Spider-Man 3)
&lt;The MCU ended with Infinity War. Now we have all the new woke characters like feminist Thor, Captain Feminist, <br>and Iron Man replacement Ironheart. Brie Larson was the beginning of a new age of wokeness. <br>With the possibility of alternate universe Disney can make infinite woke versions of all characters.&gt;
This is why nick fury named the organization called the avengers
Scarlett Johansson should have played Captain Marvel &amp; Black Widow. 🤣
Spider-Man no way home or the marvels who are you choosing
Behf
Doing the first watch and in timeline order and this was an incredibly boring movie compared to First Avenger. Time for Iron Man next.
Dam u captain Marvel! Why couldn&#39;t you release a year later!? Poor alita suffered cus of u
God is Love 🙏❤️.
JESUS loves you and died for you 💔🙏.
This movie gives me pain
Worst film of marvel but still got superduperhit thats the hipe of infinity war
We have no idea, what threats are out there! <b>Captain Marvel hits an old lady</b><br>i respect tobey more now
I never watched this movie cause of how many people told me it was bad and all that, i watched it today and what im gonna say is.. dont let other people turn you off in watching something cause they say bad stuff about it, im pretty mad at myself for not watching this in theaters or before, you do you and watch it yourself. I loved this movie, and i really dont know wtf or where tf it is wrong with it or what is bad. Maybe its the drama?? the skrulls design?  im just assuming cause i didnt have a problem with those..
&lt;Kalima Kam : &quot;What does it mean to be a woman in film?&quot; <br>Brie Larson :  &quot;It means it&#39;s really hard, ah and if you&#39;re a woman of color it&#39;s really really hard.&quot; <br>--Says the privileged Caucasian Illuminati puppet who took the Captain Marvel role away from a woman of color. The first female Captain Marvel was a black woman named Monica.&gt;
Hello from 2022
Guys I know its 2021 but do ya guys know that Captain Marvel can teleport. So basically Captain Marvel power came from an infinity stone called space stone but if you watch WHAT IF 2021 Disney Plus MARVEL episode 8 Vision Ultron has a ship and suddenly he teleported with the ship gone and when he teleport the teleportation is blue and we all know that Vision Ultron has infinity stones all of them so Captain Marvel has teleportation power
So woke
Nothing special about being women superhero, so why is this trailer acting like it&#39;s a big deal. It&#39;s not like black panther trailer went on about t&#39;challa being a black superhero
March of 2019. My family and I went to our local mall&#39;s theater to watch the movie. It was a blast.<br><br>Man, I miss 2019...
The movie was ok i guess. Probably should have picked a different actress but whatever.
I love captain Marvel. She is very cool, calm and collected.
Now way its been 3 years!!!!
!!!
Am i the only one that think Captain Marvel is a good movie?
Youtube after 3 years...... yes, lets reccomend this
Could have chosen a better captain marvel
Fabulous outstanding movie ❤️❤️❤️
People get caught up in their Brie Larson hate train, but I remember how excited I was for this movie and how imp Captain Marvel was for the Endgame plotline. She just made some bad jokes (her dry humor def didn&#39;t translate well) and here we are left with a negative impression towards her and Captain Marvel.
Ok. Been few years now. Fans are not taking to captain marvel. Please make next one good. This movie was only successful being tween avengers movies. But it’s Disney. They like alienating fan bases. So we’ll see.
the most rewatchable mcu movie
still my favourite mcu origin movie it just gets better and better with each rewatch
brie larson is marvellous
loved this movie
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br>The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br>                         But O heart! heart! heart!<br>                            O the bleeding drops of red,<br>                               Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>                                  Fallen cold and dead.<br><br>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>                         Here Captain! dear father!<br>                            This arm beneath your head!<br>                               It is some dream that on the deck,<br>                                 You’ve fallen cold and dead.<br><br>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br>The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br>                         Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>                            But I with mournful tread,<br>                               Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>                                  Fallen cold and dead.
WE LOVE CAPTAIN MARVELLOUS
&lt;“Our culture will be so much richer the day that we stop saying, ‘Hey, it’s all white dudes who are running things,&#39;” Christian Bale said. “Whether that be Hollywood, whether that be Washington, you know. We’re going to get, in Hollywood, so much better films and so much more interesting stories being told and America will become the America that the rest of the world sees it as, that makes it unique…that we recognize makes this such a beautiful, brilliant country.”&gt;
&lt;Christian Bale has had enough of “white guys” running everything in Hollywood and beyond. The actor stopped by AOL Build with his “Hostiles” co-star Rosamund Pike and Wes Studi on December 18 and told the crowd that the reason he moved to the U.S. in the first place was because he wanted his kids to grow up in a “country of inclusion.” Unfortunately, that ideal hasn’t been too much of a reality.&gt;
&lt;Christian Bale Says Hollywood (and the World) Would Be Better If ‘White Dudes’ Weren’t in Charge of Everything The actor says there would be &quot;so much better films and so much more interesting stories&quot; if white dudes weren&#39;t running Hollywood.

&lt;Boring Mary Sue based off delusional feminist Kelly Sue DeConnick&#39;s rubbish comics.👎&gt;
This film is very very bad!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=91">1:31</a> got mcgregor’d
I am from 2 years later.<br>The movie sucks
I just don&#39;t understand how can you not like this movie?
It&#39;s super weird that Marvel movies were on a roll being awesome (excluding thor dw) UNTIL this movie. I feel like they made it bad on purpose, it just makes no sense to me that it turned out one of the least enjoyable Marvel films of all time when it had so much potential.
worst movie after thor the dark world
Still one of the top movie of all time.
The rapid decline of the MCU starts here.
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=88">1:28</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=92">1:32</a> “Discover What Makes Her A Hero” Shows carol punching an old lady)<br>I think it manipulates young girls to believe in order to be a hero and someone important they need to fight against old social rules and norms represented by an old lady. I think that manipulation is wrong and deceitful. Another trick from movie industry...
I love you brie Larson ❤️❤️❤️
I found this movie cringe af they could have done it lot better
Gotta watch this now since my exam is over .
It amazes me at how the average MCU fan thinks that origin stories have to be the same as Captain America,  Iron Man, Dr Strange and Antman.  Protagonist starts out one way, needs to go through a series of &quot;struggles&quot; to &quot;earn&quot; their powers. They see that as the only way to show character development&quot;.  🙄
They literally hyped up punching  an old lady
No way home will be better 👀
when the fuckin trailer is better than movie
LOL, Worst movie from marvel ever.
Fun fact,this 60 million views trailer had more dislike than 248 million views infinite war trailer
they should put Nova (Richard Rider) next.
This Movie Was Kinda Trash Tbh
she does look like a female version of broly, doesn&#39;t she? idk my mind is going nutz these days .-.
Am I the only one who thoroughly enjoyed this film through and through when it came out? Cause I still love it and I don&#39;t care what anyone else says.
I tried to watching this the first time today, don&#39;t know whats going on and it&#39;s boring
Wow Nick fury is Black
Mafias or big persons daughter asking for role in marvel 😡
Got frustrated at work and so tired from it ,decided to start watching the Marvel series and I gotta say I understand the hype , they&#39;re making my days much better lol
O mY God It S ThE GuY FrOm FoRtNiTe
I feel like I’m the only who actually enjoys this movie
&lt;Oh look, it&#39;s Captain Flat Gluts here to save the world from the make-believe patriarchy.&gt;
Captain Marvel is like Goku
the whole captain marvel idea is a result of lazy writing. having some one with unlimited power who makes all other characters useless contributed to marvel going bankrupt in the 90&#39;s.
What caused this to flop is DC trying to sell the image of a female Captain Marvel. It’s just daft and inaccurate on so many levels. They cared too much about gender equal super hero roles instead of showing appreciation to die hard fans in presenting the original male Captain Marvel. Two thumbs waaay down!!!
I remember seeing this 2 years ago it was fun especially seeing Nick and that Cat 😂❤
I can’t get past 20 min of the movie before I fall asleep
Black Panther in Civil War has more character development.
I actually like this movie.
Space invasion ! Lollll
Truth. Must be told! And ilegal nonesense big time happening right now!
Space invasion! Asshats
Electroshok therapy
Truth be told
So all the planets speak English
NICK FURY<br>2014: Last time i trusted someone, i lost an eye...... <br>1995: OH MOTHER FLERKEN!!!!! (After got scratched by Moose)<br><br>Nick is the True Liar than Loki.....
saw a lot of criticism in the comments but i finally watched it and to be very honest it&#39;s not bad at all i mean that&#39;s her character she lost her memories what is she supposed to do? and i enjoyed it more than black widow. she is still pretty new to the mcu compared to og avengers maybe that&#39;s the reason audience doesn&#39;t feels connected? give her time
I Like watching the captain marvel she its badass
Sorry Brie. Maybe voice or speach classes. I could not understand HALF of anything you said. Not all your fault. Poor direction, no direction. Typical Marvel movies. All action, no plot. This was all over the place.
&lt;This rubbish feminist won&#39;t ever be loved like Black Widow. I don&#39;t care how powerful the woke warriors at Disney make this Mary Sue Carol Danvers. Black Widow contributed more to the MCU than any other female character.&gt;
I was pretty disappointed in this movie. Brie won an Oscar years prior and sadly this role was dry and boring.
bad
last time, I saw lots of criticism to Larson, tbh, didn&#39;t want to watch the film cause of that but then I ended up watching it, first 30 minutes of the film, she irks me, but then I realized that was so toxic and eventually I didn&#39;t find the film that bad. I think the character kinda suits her well. Im just annoyed of the fact that captain marvel wasn&#39;t able to show up during infinity war, although the reason makes sense but still...
Personal opinion:- This movie is better than Black widow
&quot;I&#39;m gonna end it&quot; stupid line
కెప్టెన్ మార్వెల్ మంచు లక్ష్మి ఫ్రెండ్ హా..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=90">1:30</a> the only reason I watched the trailer
to be fair.. the trailer was excellent..
Has Brie Larson career ended yet?
Carol Danvers is my wife
🎶That’s my girl 🎶
Fury is the best character
I love her
Bro this should have more likes
I like nick fury. He is funny with the cat
I have no idea why i didn&#39;t like this movie when i paid for the cinema ticket on its release date. Today, after 849 days i found a low res version streaming online... if you dont pay for it and if you dont pay much attention, its a splendid movie!
Goosebumps 2 4 Realms Grinch and Ralph Breaks Internet AMC theater Fall 2018 and early 2019 DVD&#39;s like Incredibles 2 Small Foot and Puplantis
This is the first female led superhero film where the main heroine isn&#39;t half naked or wearing spandex. Or look like a supermodel for that matter.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BCujX3pw8&amp;t=108">1:48</a>
Forgettable
Actress without any expression on face 😂😂
The best marvel hero👍👍👍
Captain Marvel is a MAN.<br>Carol Danvers initially appeared as a love interest, not the titular hero, in 1968&#39;s “Captain Marvel” series. The original superhero was a male alien named Mar-Vell who posed undercover on Earth as a human scientist. ... But as the &#39;70s feminist movement grew, so too did Danvers&#39;s role as a character.<br>Need l say more?...
Captain marvel is a man in the comic books.  Get it right,  and I&#39;ll watch a movie.
Possibly the most boring of ANY Marvel movie since 2000.
Again in 2021
Who is here after knowing that park seo Joon is gonna be in captain marvels 2.iam eagerly waiting for him to cast in the second part.
&lt;The worst MCU character promoting radical feminism just like Kelly Sue DeConnick wanted.&gt;
Breath
Best Movie EVER!!!
She is one of my favorite character in the MCU😌
I really disgust by toxic thor fans.Captain Marvel was a good movie and Brie carried the whole movie perfectly.I love Thor also by the way and i think they would have perfect team together.Can you stop being such an idiot hater at least.
I&#39;ve not seen this movie till date. Is it worth it? This is the ONLY marvel movie which I haven&#39;t seen
Nobody :<br>Literally nobody :<br>Brie: hits a old woman
Brie larsson did an amazing job! loved this movie
&lt;Rubbish feminist propaganda film based on Kelly Sue DeConnick&#39;s rubbish feminist comics.&gt;
