Noo that beautiful car is broken now
The Fast and Furious Franchise should have Ended here only. There was no need For Dom&#39;s Brother.
❤❤❤🎉
best
That&#39;s one fast submarine
this is my favorite movie ❤
That&#39;s not the way firecworks but whatever.
<b>Letty:</b> (reaction of Cipher) This (beep) is crazy!<br><b>Me:</b> I agree with you, Letty.
Love these movies but i stg if i were one of them i would beat Dom up for always trying to kill himself. damn
That would be a hell of a tire advertisement because I sometimes can’t go from a standstill without spinning everywhere…..and stopping from 80mph on ice like that within 20feet?   I can’t do that when I’m on asphalt
Its Fast and Furious guys.. they&#39;ll make a corner store shift gears and travel 100mph of they think its a good idea. Stop putting so much thought into this BS
Cameraman had to be taken above the fireball just in time to prove cameraman never dies!
That whole thing that we just watched was about as believable as me crapping out a $1,000,000 from my hole!
This series went from a family oriented street race/crime movie series to a full blown classic call of duty campaign
<b>Dom:</b> (to Cipher) I destroyed two of your teams. I killed your red-headed boyfriend and I put two killers on your untraceable plane. You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon. Now guess who I&#39;m coming for.<br><br><b>Me:</b> I love that line.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=69">1:09</a> “I killed your red-headed boyfriend” <br>She knew she messed with the wrong team
Hey Star Wars, that&#39;s how you make a good part 8.
Amazing that his family all drove in front of Dom and protected him from the blast.
And THAT is how you give your villain the middle finger without killing them.
Roman and hobbs crazy team 😂😂😂
Does anyone know the name of the soundtrack in this scene? I&#39;ve been looking for an eternity now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=49">0:49</a>

I like the part where the cars surrounded him to protect him
Wait? No one&#39;s gonna talk about how did he outrun a heatseeker?<br>Oh I get it!! Family, right?
Poor Charlize Theron 😢
The “we have family”, “avengers” jokes here are getting SO old

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=97">1:37</a>&quot;thats a goddamn heat seeker coming at us
tell. me how dom. is surviving the car crashes
Somehow Wonder Woman works with Cipher and has a Submarine of her own.
Wow, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=138">2:18</a> Dom did that for his son..... :O

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=190">3:10</a> i love how all of them used their cars to shield dom it just makes me so happy
If you&#39;re older than 7 years old and you still enjoy watching this movie, don&#39;t forget your helmet before you leave the house.
isn&#39;t there a nuc on the submarine how come the explosion didn&#39;t blow up the nuc?
In reality:<br>&quot;That&#39;s a godda-...&quot; BOOM!<br>End credits.
Cipher ruined the franchise. Period
I wonder what Will the government do for chaos in their country
Family stick up for each other
When dom said that&#39;s my girl so cute
Dude what?
I like how they are trying to stop the NUCLEAR sub from escaping yet they decide to blow it up  when the warhead is in it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=161">2:41</a> not the gtx!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=159">2:39</a> DOM!!! 😂😂😂
Dom&#39;s car literally went supersonic.
They&#39;ll learn bout this in physics class
Because family
Film shows cars can go faster than missiles. <br>And <br>With all  respect to Paul walker ,may his soul RiP.<br>This movie shows a cars can protect from huge blast.<br>But sadly Paul couldn&#39;t survive from car accident.
Why not just drive left or right? Away from the sub instead of going straight to where it can chase you? The car can easily maneuver away whereas the sub would make wide turns
Dom cars don&#39;t have flares
People always criticize these movies but they forget that physics does not exist in the F&amp;F universe.
bullshit if that sub fast then car
They would’ve won if they didn’t surface the sub
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=189">3:09</a><br>Dom and the team are great and lucky they survived such blast.<br>--<br>I just imagine if fifth spirit elsa used her ice barrier to block the flames if she will succeed just like how she succeeded in protecting her castle against a huge wave caused by the dam&#39;s destruction.
sub chasing fast cars 😞
Dom’s crew/family on a mission. <br><br>One scared, everyone having fun while focusing on the objective
Roman: GET US OUTTA HERE!!!!<br>Hobbs: Why are you always yelling?<br><br>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait is don a dad
Meaning of a true family family never betrays
Yeah, that&#39;s not how fire works.
I hate all of the new Fast And Furious movies they are just to high tech I loved the old classic street racing I think Fast 7 was the last best fast and furious
Most people don&#39;t know that missiles only fly at 200mph or less, and can penetrate the double steel bulkhead of a submarine, and that all automobiles have an anti-fire force shield.
M15+ action violence and coarse language
Boom!
lol
Typical Hollywood movie..full of BS like their own people
Now that&#39;s family.<br><br>Also, outracing a heat-seeker and slamming it straight back into the sub? Priceless tension!
Dom&#39;s teammates protect for Dom. That scene explains why FF series famous for global fans.

I re-visit this clip and still laughing when dom outruns a missile that looks like an aim 9 going at mach 2.5  Too bad for the pilots, they must think fast in a few seconds until impact.

Not even fire is saved from the lack of physics here.

Dom is basically superman at this point.🤣bro should be in the hospital but nope he never gets hurt when being in a car crash🤣.
Don&#39;t understand the power of family
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=64">1:04</a> My Best Clip
Totally real dont @ me
Even cipher survived the look on her face accepting loss is pure payback
Why everyone is talking about physics its entertainment so just enjoy amd feel🖤
when dom got caught in the fire thats exactly what i want to feel in the shower a balance between cold and warm
the funny thing that is an aim9l its launched from plane and commonly used on the a10 warthog
Goosebombs when i see the saving at the end
These people for their personal interest and friendship can destroy the whole world😂
in the multiverse....Dom has no family...
The only things is Wrong is that<br>Akula submarine is so fast even if breaking the ice and that anti Aircraft heat seeking missile can go hypersonic maybe like Mach 4.6 Mach 1 is equivalent to the speed of sound so that thing is almost 5x the speed of sound 🤣🇷🇺
This is pretty much what I expected when I clicked on &quot;Fate of the Furious, heat seeking missile scene&quot;.
Next movie is about fight against god and bringing  paul back from heaven.
loved every Single movie because i watch movies for Entertainment. And not logic
Who cares if these things doesn’t make sense? They are very fun to watch
Dom literally yeeted physics from his family. Best daddy ever
So I guess everyone had the same idea at the same time? Not only that, they were able to get into a perfect formation without crashing into one another for the same spot. And the fact that this worked. No cars flew, no glasses broken. Nothing flew over the cars and landed on Dom or anything. Nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=147">02:27</a> II... AAAAAM.... GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!
Okay, I know this movie ignored physics entirely, but if that explosion is huge and emerged from under the ice, shouldn&#39;t it crack all the ice surrounding the area?
Last 4 movies this mf dom just dont die . He must have nine lives
Masterpiece!
Team work makes the dream work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=189">3:09</a>
What he should&#39;ve done is break the ice and go underwater to avoid fire.
This is a nice movie
That should not be real
Now dats what you call family
Fast and furious real too the need for speed route
Poor armoured vehicle driver. Crushed by ice and steel.

Omtyerwds
Tanckyou im iran👍👍👍👍
I love when people complain about physics in an action movie lmao.
Definitely how heatseakers work definitely wont be blinded on the ground

Why Hollywood always mess up missile related scenes:<br>#1 A Heat Seeker or any missile don&#39;t follow the target they predict the  position where the target will be at a given time and it intercept the target. <br>#2 Dom will never be able to outrun any missile as they travel at a high speed i.e. it can reach upto 2.25 Mach and is impossible to outrun them with a car.<br>#3 At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=122">2:02</a>, Dom would&#39;ve been already dead. Missile don&#39;t change their course and also it would have exploded and killed him even before he turns.<br>#4 Even if he was able to outrun, a missile won&#39;t comeback after you. Ever.<br>#5 By the time Dom reached the submarine, the missile would&#39;ve ran out of fuel.<br>#6 Missile don&#39;t make physical contact with their target or any object they explode before contact and it&#39;s the fragments that causes the damage.
I Vin Diesel I know his son
Laws of physics in this movie: <b>No.</b>
why doesn’t any of the videos show the full wheelie ???
Caleb Walker and Cody Walker will have to portray Paul Walker’s legendary beloved character Brian O’Connor in FX!
i see they didnt say to justin lin how physics work
Cypher’s submarine may be strong, but not as strong as family
That mad Scientist laughter HAHAHAHA
That scene was too much
&#39;&#39; Get us out of here!!!&#39;&#39;<br><br><br>&#39;Why are you always yelling?!&#39;<br><br>I am dying :D

Submarine be doing 60 in 2.5 seconds 😏😏
It&#39;s confirmed.. Ice charger has about 75000hp and dom&#39;s jacket is heat proof
Yea the cars wouldnt of stopped the heat hed of been burned alive from his lungs.
😮🔥🔥🔥😮😮😠😠😠😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🙂
I think dom deservse this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=188">3:08</a> family
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=85">1:25</a> - Love how her mental state shatters when she finally met her worthy opponent
Thanks to Dom&#39;s physics knowledge he saved his family
Is it just me, or is that submarine unrealistically fast? I thought subs could only get up to 56 km&#39;s an hour. Did they strap a rocket to this thing?
I love fast and furious all 8 of them I haven&#39;t seen the 9 yet but I bet it will be amazing, and I love that all he thinks is about family, I love my family too, and I totally get why he says he&#39;s got family ❤, I&#39;ve got family too😊😉😃😄😁😉😊👍👍
Positivity Moving Forward
Don’t interfere or interrupt me Ever
I’m No SLAVE
Positivity Moving Forward
That’s My girl😌✅❤️‍🔥🤴🏾✊🏾
This is still more believable then F9
FAMILY
Pretty dure Dom would have been burned alive.
Kosatka griefer
Fire is strong, but family is stronger 😂😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=192">3:12</a>
Laws of physics are applied throughout the movie
The fact it takes 2 previous antagonist from the movies before Fate of the Furious to take on Cipher. That&#39;s like Madara and Obito Uchiha trying to take out Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. Or side quest bosses taking out the main quest final boss.<br><br>You get my point.
Letty’s signature word:DOM
Remember when they used to steal dvd players and tv, work at their resto bar at morning and race in the evening? Good times.
not a single vehicle can outrun a 7,500 mph missile.
The family vs Avengers in a fight, who do you think will win??
Why have physics when you can have family?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=7">0:07</a>
Last scene is cool
Ok, but Dom’s comeback was solid.
The level of ridiculous is astounding!
This is laughable 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=42">0:42</a> When you remind yourself that those caracters were stealling old TVs with neon cars in Fast and Furious 1.
I&#39;m pretty sure a heatseeker travels faster than 120mph lol<br><br>Try Mach 3/Mach 4<br><br><br><br>Among countless other things.
This is so ridiculous and I love it!
Thanos : I got an entire army <br>Avengers : we got a hulk <br>Dom : I got family <br>Avengers and thanos: woah woah (ran away)
Still hard to watch Fast and Furious series without Paul 😢
Who needs heat seeking missiles when you have family?
FAMILY!
It amazing how they have better traction ok ice than they would on asphalt
This movie brings back memories from when I was young and watching Cartoons. It&#39;s stupid but fun to watch
Guys y&#39;all should stop complaining about physics and logic and stuff at this point and just have fun like me🤣🤣
Family gets me here
All started because Brian decided not to go to Fat Burgers.
Also fun fact all misses on warships have a minimum safe launching distance of about 8km at least for American subs. So yea the safety systems on board wouldn’t let her fire unless she knew how to disable them
This is why I love street racing. I love escaping from missiles and torpedoes it really gets your adrenaline flowing!!
I said two times I think this movie is dumb and welp this is more stupid then the last clips
He was about to go Barry Allen and faze through the blast, good thing his family got his back.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=124">2:04</a> the missile knows where it is because it knows where it isn&#39;t
Rip torettos car
Whos here because of that fckin &quot;family&quot; meme of Dom everywhere on facebook. 😂
Remember when this movie is about drag racing
From fighting for a 10sec car to stoping a nuc war
good thing fire cant go under cars
The Cheese 🧀 factor is huge in these movie&#39;s.
&#39;&#39;Why are you always yelling?&#39;&#39;
Movies are to entertain.....not to follow physics.... IDK why everybody is in physics!!???<br><br><br><br>DOM is inevitable...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=64">1:04</a> I&#39;m sorry but this is hilariously cringey
I dont care what some people say about these movies i still like n love them especially the action n hypeness in the movie n it kinda got u goosebumps too  but i do noticed that dom always crash his muscle car in every movie since the first one n it always be rebuild in each sequel i guess that&#39;s his trademark in the movie he crashed his car n saves the day like always n they go home n party n have a beer too lol😂😎 i guess dom is the optimus prime of the fast n furious movies lol🙏💖😂😎😍😎😎😎😎😎
The real casualties in this series are:<br>Physics and brain cells.<br>Rest in peace!
what is faster? a missile flying at supersonic speeds or a car going 80-100 mph
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=63">1:03</a> Cypher got incinerated with that comeback line!
&quot;Illogic&quot;.<br><br>That&#39;s the term I think we should coin for the driving force behind this, the torpedo scene, the harpoon scene, and even scenes from other movies, like the final sequence in Tai Lung&#39;s escape, because that&#39;s what those scenes are: Illogical.
I don&#39;t understand...<br>How did the ice not break in such heat and fire???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=190">3:10</a> i hear a voice in my head who&#39;s singing the power rangers song....<br>you know, &quot;go go power rangeeeers 🎶&quot;

dom’s face is always<br>   \   /<br>   o  o<br>   <i>__</i>
Physicans:🥸💥
Even physics was scared of Dom Toretto
Even if the cars didn&#39;t show up he probably would&#39;ve survived still.
😆😆😆
It&#39;s 2021, and Dom outruns a mach 4 missile fired from a launcher that doesn&#39;t even exist on submarines. We are all too jaded to be confused
I just want to note, the way IR guided missiles (heat seekers) work is they track heat off of any target,  they weren’t putting off enough heat for it to have a lock, not to mention when dim dodged the missiles which wouldn’t happen, they would immediately lose tracking and fly straight, then they also track by where the target will be, not where it is, then those missiles pull ridiculously g’s the Russian r60 could pull 30g’s the aim9 m could pull 50g’s then those missiles move over Mach 2.5 and that’s being generous so by all standards, dim should be dead but there’s some avionic science for you there
I got goosebumps after seeing this clip 😳
I don&#39;t now why doms car in fast and furious 8  the fate off the furious
fun fact : Dom&#39;s car is made of Vibranium
I need a full set of those ice tires are they BS Goodrich?
What I don&#39;t get is why they didn&#39;t turn left or right I know they were heading forward to that gate thing but they still could have drove to the left or right side of the sub so it can&#39;t hit some of them
So dodgy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=121">2:01</a> wait missile can&#39;t do a full turn, can it?
Guys in the submarine:<br><br><br>C R I S P Y
Master Chief-&quot;I&#39;m giving the covenant back their bomb!&quot;
And they say Bollywood movies are without any concept of physics.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

The Fast And The Furious: <b>Street racers</b><br>Fate of The Furious: <b>Avengers Level Threat</b>
Meanwhile Heat seeker missile: m I joke to you boy...? You can&#39;t beat my speed bro.... 2 to 3 mach speed
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
no way a submarine can go that fast
Family
Ppl keep talking about physics physics physics I&#39;m like who GAF just stfu and enjoy the movie from an action pack standpoint 😂
the fire didn’t melt the ice? HOW
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=41">0:41</a> That laugh will never not get to me, look at the goddamn expression on her face. Letty was SO expecting not to walk from that lmao
Slowest missile ever
Everyone say heatseeker a few more times so the audience knows whats up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=192">3:12</a> ah yes because they can all just  come to a complete stop on ice after driving a high speeds with no one sliding into each other and the fire miraculously doesn’t touch Dom after it engulfing the cars lol
Que bonito final de esta escena 🥺🥰👍
If physics ever decides to make a cameo in one of these movies,dom and fam would be dead fast <br>And furious :)
Yeah right...
So silly 😂😂 but badass
Natural disasters: known to wreak havoc and reap destruction upon everything that hinders it’s path.<br>Dom: Family<br>Natural Disasters: Aight Imma head out
Come in the side of the city my stuff and it’s not going to rock bottom in Kratos Hunan without a single cool cool cool cool cool superhero but it does take a check to Sun
Don’t listen to them a couple years you so that you could tomorrow because she really lets why do you feel scared of it I’m at the go to say
CREDITS: The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious.<br>ME: Nah, really?
Don&#39;t take these movies so seriously and complain about the reality of everything wrong with them, It&#39;s like the Michael Bay Transformers movies If you ignore the story and disregard everything involving realism or any kind of intelligence they&#39;re kind of fun to watch so if it makes you feel better consider them a guilty pleasure.
You need a maximum IQ of 60 to enjoy this
Its been 4 years, Who still watching this video?
Fascinated by how the fire didn&#39;t get through the bottom space of the cars.
Como es que todos los autos tienen tracción sobre el hielo?
Remember when letty was riding a Nissan 240sx and drag racing
What is it with Dom and fire?
Wait..... KOSATSKA FROM GTA ONLINE CAME FROM THIS?
Charlize Theron should do more villain roles.
Say what you must, but Dom&#39;s mustang is goregous.
Cypher is having a paddy
Please tell me there&#39;s nothing to worry about.<br>We got this.
<b>Physics has left the chat</b>
The fate of the furious is the antidote to the scientists &#39; question : &quot;why is there religion&quot;?!
It looks like physics, chemistry,botany, zoology &amp; every other known sciences took sick leave during the filming of this franchise.
Me when physics is absent.
Awe that&#39;s my girl
At the end we all should agree to one word - &quot;Family&quot;
GTA 5 missions be like
Y then lambo tho
Hobbs: why are u always screaming                Roman: COUSE IM SCARED
Yuyun susu 👙
those movie maker doesn&#39;t know that submarine speed and car speed is not same
Dom’s girl: That’s not good!<br>Me: No dip Sherlock
Hobbs to Roman why are u always yelling 😂😂
So a submarine can move at over 100 mph while breaking the ice? And a submarine has heatseekers? Also a car moves faster than a missile?<br>Remember, all this AFTER we have disregarded physics.
The movies changed when the rock came
Submarines don’t run that fast
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=81">1:21</a> “Put a heat seeker on him now.......NOW!!!” Cipher’s villainous breakdown
Как же прекрасны спецэффекты!
Without Paul walker the movie is faded
Wowww
That ice got better traction that most expressways.
I don&#39;t know who is harder to kill between Dom and Thanos
Adamlar ne film yapmışlar la 🤣
“I don’t have physics, I have family”
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon!
dom name is like a pizza
Anything&#39;s possible when family<br><br>                                      -dom
I love how the entire comment section is just making fun of the movie lol.
I think anyone in the bow and stern may have survived, albeit with minor burns
I cannot emphasise how goddamn slow that missile is. I simply cannot.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=105">1:45</a> What&#39;s the name of this particular soundtrack?
Your stupid everyone they cover him when they don’t no him
They should’ve just got some boost and aerieled away
I don&#39;t thnk that&#39;s how heat seeking missals, explosions, cars, and fire works... but you go girl.
Soooo. Apparently submarines can go 100mph while breaking through ice lmao. And a heat seeking missile can’t go as fast as a muscle car driving through snow and ice hahaha.<br>Submarines can go only 20mph give or take.....and that’s not through ice.<br>Heat seeking missiles go about 1,500 mph. And let’s say Dom is driving about 100mph in the snow ( I’m being nice).<br>Like come on, fast and furious 1 and 2 were the only good movies. Now it’s just cheesy unrealistic action scenes.
Man got toasted like armin from attk on titan
Crossed the extreme level of Action
<b>physics has left the chat</b>
Dom: starts driving<br>Car: <b>chuckles</b> I&#39;m in danger
😃😃😀😀😤😤😤😤😤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🌪🌪🌪😁😁🌪
Never knew all you need to save the world was some Cali street racers... I wanna meet the people who write these films...
I like doms ice charger
I kinda feel sorry for Dom...... He keeps getting his car destroyed and has to buy a new one......
true friends never abandon u

So uh...<br><br>...DVD players?
In 3 minutes this movie said fu€k you to all laws of physics
It was nice when Dom&#39;s team drove to save him when the sub exploded
Good

Why do they try to keep out running it lol? I mean, they could literally just go left or right and escape it.

I like how Cipher&#39;s crew are willing to cause a nuclear war but are all hesitant to launch a heat seeking missile on Dom lol
Always The Family Is Behind You
That&#39;s my girl😎
After seeing Hobbs and Shaw the fast and furious franchise is now considered sci fi
does anyone else come close to tears when he blows up or destroys these beautiful cars!
bro imagine of albert einstein was still alive he would end his life after seeing these physics
Who needs physics when you have family?
Paul wants Tyrence Cheated on with 14,000 people beacuse Tyrence had oral.

That’s family man
Iya ya Allah.
Kind of hard to keep the anger in, now she registered on an emotional level and lost.
Even the MCU is more realistic than this
The best climax
(Starts driving), that’s not good, (looks back...) THATS NOT GOOD!
It still blows my mind how no cgi was used
I love how that just keep grabbing a higher gear 😂
I think my IQ has just dropped by 40 points.

Madmax on ice.
Went from street racing to Michael Bay 😎😂
I&#39;m so glad those flames didn&#39;t go underneath the cars and still burn him alive😁😒😞
After fast 5 the films became irrelevant
That’s what I call a team
All this over a Tuna Sandwich
that end was fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Audience : how did he dodge that heat seeker on the hill <br><br>Dom: with family
and that, is how Dom lost his hair<br>(i know he&#39;s already bald dont ruin it)
The best scene that i ever seen
At this rate the final fast and furious will be the decepticon killing one of doms family member and now doms out for revenge and has to partner up with the autobots. But wait while fiighting the decepticons they come across a godzilla which destroys optimus prime and so megatron decides to team up with dom to kill the godzilla in revenge for killing his rival.
FF1: Racing cars<br>FF8: Superman
All the fast saga movies are great but furious 7 has a special place in our hearts.
I really want to watch this movie
Why didn&#39;t they just turn away from the sub lol
Only thing that makes sense is that nothing makes sense
Me:Pretty sure the fire would have just burned through the car and still kill Dom...<br>Dom: This ain&#39;t gonna kill me.I got family.<br>Me: He&#39;s got family.
MATHEUS
Just realized something. Dom flips at the end of almost every movie
I didnt know that Submarines can go 150-200kmh fast
They turned all the main characters into captain america super soldiers.
they really dont write scripts for these things, they just write one liners over and over
i have a question, why tf they tryna outrun the sub (witch in fact must be slow asf) They could just go sideways and escape it.
I swear to god, can dom never keep his dodge in one piece for like the whole movie (ok this doesn&#39;t make much sense but oh well)
Toerrto Dom vs Missles Strikes
Why they always run from the enemy in a straight line just pull away
Roman: GET US OUT OF HERE<br>Hobbs: WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS TELLING?
that white wrx ooohh myyy
As unreal as this is I love it
i am selling the crashed car, still works fine
Dhoni bihari
me watching this scene: &quot;Just steer left or right, away from that submarine!&quot; xD
Vin and Michelle look great
i wanna start a petition to end this franchise. they need to go back to their roots
Tom should have jump on the righter side so his car doesn’t explode
Dom and Letty look great together
Seriously, in almost every Fast and Furious Movie that had Vin Diesel, he was always the Alpha Male, even more so than Hobbs and Shaw. Everyone heeded his command even Hobbs, and only he could pull a stunt like that...
We the. Fight me ferfectly
ممكن تاكلون خرة
Only cockroaches and Dom can survive a nuclear explosion.
!o
This scene is incredible. I love how Dom went on the crew&#39;s side.

Get us out of here! Rock: why are you always yelling?! Him again: what else am I suppose to say?!?!?!

that isnt just a team its a family as dom says
Wat is the character of dom.. is he s hero or villain or thief or a business man os wat he destroys cars worth crores...
what the hell is this
Fast and furious was so much better, when they kept it real. All this CGI has ruined the franchise in my eyes.
Truthfully how they all came back to cover him brought me to tears because that’s what love looks like

So Fast and Furious series turned into a super heroes franchise?
It seemed so plausible
Fast9000: <br>Letty: DOM!!!!<br><br>Dom: Family. (Drives through Goku&#39;s Kamehame.)<br><br>Fast 1 million: <br>Letty: DOM!!!!!!!<br><br>Dom: Family. (Smashes car into The Living Tribunal.)<br><br>Fast 8 billion and 4:<br>Letty: DOM!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Dom: Family.

(Kamikaze&#39;s car through the mutiverse of all fiction.) ...............................................................<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>-----&gt;He survives this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=202">3:22</a> ah yes. because everyone knows fire can&#39;t go UNDER cars. genius
Dom can survive anything
That was cool when you were on the ice Fate of the furious😎
Keep in mind a truck driver with a shotgun effected them more
What kind of sub has heat seeking anti air missiles? Those thing can go super sonic too so he should be dead.

Next title should be.. <br>FF to the moon
how much fuel does that fox 3 have bro omg
😂без коментариев.
Now THAT is what a family is 😌😎
I am pretty sure that heat seaker can travel at a minimum speed of 760 mph.
that not good that not good
the screenwriters must have been drinking too much grey goose to think a heavily armored charger  can outpace a missle 😂😂😂
Upload part 8 fast furious
Movie superb 🙏🙏🙏👀
زززززززززززززز
Should have just stopped at fast and the furious.
people always complain about the physics in fast and furious movies...  but serious though... have you guys watch any bollywood movies... compared to this... this is realistic... okay not really but... comparibly... it is...
The voice acting on some of the characters is awful
The VFX THO 🤢
i guess they were usin cuban fire
I&#39;ll have to put this scene right behind Indiana Jone&#39;s refrigirator.

Can anyone actually die?
So you’re telling me the only car that was modified to jump just so happens to be the only one that needed it
Apparently the fire didnt melt the ice they were on

The only thing that i truly loved about this movie, was the tribute to Xander Cage. With the camera angle.
foda
Physics declined chat invitation.
Now close u mouth 😂
Why are you always yelling at me
They all saved Dom. LIKE A FAMILY
Thats not how fire works
Im kinda confused on how the team could hear dom when he told them to peel off.....😕😶
&#39;&#39;Why are you always yelling?!&#39;&#39;<br><br>me:SO THAT THIS VEHICLE DONT GET FLIPPED OVER AND GETS FLATTENED AND WE DIE
Put a heat seeker on him now.<br>NOOOW!!!!!
Physicists must hate this franchise
You say she is crazy but that laugh is crazy
Issac Newton didn’t die for this 😔
Not finna lie da ending da dope tho
so none of that fire went under their cars?
Is this new terminator movie
That’s just silly
Why Newton why you even have that apple stuck over your head.<br><br>See this is happening :p

even on ice Dom can get the front tires off the ground. This guy should be setting up suspensions for a living.
That bald head sure can take heat
Didn’t know flames are resistant to bald heads
Generally this movie didn&#39;t have the physics most warned but let&#39;s be honest it probably isn&#39;t going to come back so complaining about the movie isn&#39;t going to do anything surely I mean I miss the old movies too but I guess at this point all we can do is accept the movies we are given or don&#39;t watch them at all that&#39;s just my opinion upon this change in the movies
Me:playing games*<br>Mom:Clean your room,we have guests coming.<br>Me:still playing*<br>Mom: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=85">1:25</a>
Its funny how many times Dom is going to risk his life and Letty is always yelling  DOM
The likeliness of this happening is on the odds of looking into a cell culture and seeing a thousand dancing hamsters.
it crazy how irl people can go 2 mph and tag a tree and die but THIS MAN CAR WAS ON FIRE, BEING SHOT AT, AND ROLLING OVER THE GROUND AT MACH 600. TF?
Wow that explosion was so hot it burned off all of Dom&#39;s hair.
I don&#39;t think modern day Heat sekkers can detect heat from the car
the fast an furiouse films are the definition of more money than sense
So Dom can drive faster than a missile and can also dodge it plus his team can also drive faster than an explosion plus he can take the heat, man people should take notes from this movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=1">0:01</a> that&#39;s your parents&#39; noise when they are playing leapfrog without you
Why are you always yelling!
Submarine running at 200🤣
Dom = Iron Man
Rich people
what if dom didnt tell cipher what he did?
He didn&#39;t die
It’s because Dom is lucky and when the fire he knows what to do
yeah thank you justin lin for fucki g the franchise up
Gets in last gear while running from a bad guy automatically gets new gear
So Dom&#39;s car blows up but none of theirs....aight then
f7 was the end of the series. nothing can change my mind
FF10 crew in talk with elon musk for space shuttle..
I thought the heat seeker was a sperm whale
Paul would have  just exploded his Supra at the point
Person I&#39;m riding with,&quot;that&#39;s not good.<br>Me: well obviously, what is this supposed to be funny?
When everybody&#39;s talking about Physics, here I am appreciating the costs they threw out for that orange lambo!! And oh, all of the high end cars which were zombiefied at the beginning. At this point, which everything&#39;s unbelievable already, you gotta look something you&#39;ll atleast appreciate at, yeah?
I&#39;m pretty positive the director of this movie failed physics in school.
Man when they shielded him was awesome! Dam I remember when I had friends a looooooong time ago!!
Remember when FnF was all about street racing and not explosion
If this was in real life none of them wouldn&#39;t have survived
Family Physics!!
Fast 8 is a recycled version of Fast 6
They never refuel throught the hoel movie. That is for all the fast and furious movies.
The fact that it shows them racing all day every day but I ain&#39;t see nobody refuel.
You just entered the Zander zone. Ops wrong movie
Yogi adityanath is an excellent actor
It was 4 cars covering dom
Nice
Scifi
They have some really special tires to get that much traction on ice

As a physics student, I can say it is possible to do this, but highly unlikely. The only point highly unfeasable, was not getting blown up when the nuclear sub exploded.
This is actually mad

Thats not how fire works tho
80% of the comments are : &quot;Remember when the movie was about street racing....&quot; <br>The rest are about how the movie defies laws of Physics,<br>yet millions of people still watch these movies and FF still makes hundreds of millions of dollars
Hats off to this scene
That’s My Girl❤️
Like car work
Best cast and awesome stunts
Could he have emp’d the missile or should I just stick to my video games?
They must have super hero tires that don&#39;t skid on ice
Who think you say run will make the clip better? &gt;:3
I swear I hear letty screaming “DOM” in every fast and furious movie
I guess their lost without Paul walker.

How to survive an explosion <br><br>Uhh...Simple just hide behind the cars you won&#39;t even get a scratch
എന്തൊക്കെ കാണണം എന്റെ പിതാവേ.,
Ooo i see meh boi wi an sti
Scientists: Where&#39;s the physics?<br><br>Dom: I ain&#39;t got physics. I got family.

I don&#39;t know who&#39;s got the stronger plot armor, Batman or Dom?
Physics never entered the chat.
america found answer to russian hypersonic missiles, Dom&#39;s car.
Dom is invincible because his cheat code is *family 🤣
Dom barely survives train hit. But completely survived car flip , jumping from high buildings , heat stroke and not a broken bone or burnt skin.
Dam remember when dom dislocated his arm flipping in the charger race. Apparently he’s become bionic man and can jump out of a flipping car and not have a single scratch
The Incredibles that’s my girl fate of the furious that’s my girl
what saved dom from the explosion? FAMILY!!!! also the fire not going under the car and getting dom. I love how they know how ridiculous these movies are and embraced it by ditching realism
Dom keeps killing muscle cars.
How&#39;s their cars driving on snow / ice at high speed ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=87">1:27</a><br>The heat seeker should have just flown down from Cipher&#39;s plane and not the submarine.
Dom can do anything with 1 car
Kayal
Can someone tell me how many times letty shouted &quot;dom!&quot;
Dom done with all racers. Now racing a missile WTF
Even mach 4 missile can&#39;t win race against Dom
Did anyone else get M.A.S.K. vibes fr this scene with the submarine? The only thing they are lacking at this point are weapons mounted on their cars.
Fake epic scene that still gives goosebumps
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=85">1:25</a>
Dom: I HAVE AN IDEA<br>Physics was kicked from the game<br>Audience: surprised pikachu face
THIS MOVIE IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL 🤯
I never seen such bs in my life
They protecc dom with their cars
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=188">3:08</a> this is so unrealistic, instead of having those cars cover dom, they should&#39;ve just let his elbow deflect the flame, would&#39;ve been more believable
Pero no en ingles
I see all these people bitchin about physics yet they still watch the sequals why is that?
And that was how every single one of them died
“Put a heater seeker on him now, Now !!!!”
thomas had never seen such bullshit before
Ni
Not to be that guy but like , wouldnt some country’s military/government be seeing all this n call to action??
That&#39;s not how fire works honey
THE COUNTERS DEADDDDDD
Dumb is like the terminator of fast and furious
Roman: <b>GET US OUT OF HERE!!!</b><br>Hobbs: <b>WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING?!?!?!</b>
I love when Dom says that&#39;s my girl and smiles.
🤩🤩
Cool
Who needs the Avengers, when we got Dom 😂
Stupid movie🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
DAMNNNNNNNNNÑNNNNNNNNNNN
I love Dom and Letty so much. It makes me laugh every time Roman says GET US OUT OF HERE and then Hobbs says WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don&#39;t remember when the last time submarines are packed with heat seeking missile

“Heat sensor on my pickle” - ski mask
That&#39;s the most awesomest  save I have ever seen all the cars circle around domanic protecting him from the explosion
I love to see the reaction of my science teacher after watching this clip
Did he have a son?
Dom yells This is my son
Gotta love Letty😭💯
That&#39;s teaches us team work to get  successful in life

Fast and furious 50: John Wick vs dom vs Batman vs hitman
You know I generally liked this movie I had no problem with it and then this scene happened.
First the team faced a tank and then a submarine, what&#39;s next an army of monster trucks?
The kid from incredible: That’s was totally wicked ‼️‼️‼️

So ridiculous...🙄🙄🙄
I can hear this video even though its muted
physics: ight imma head out
Remember when the movie was about street racing and fast cars. Now we watching call of duty with tanks and submarines
Am i the only one who liked when the gang used their cars to block raidiation to save dom? Just me? Ok

This franchise must&#39;ve ended when they &#39;stole&#39; 100M dollars.
Well the viewing population has officially lost IQ points watching this.

of course, they&#39;d all get radiation poising after that
That’s not how physics works

Why they didn&#39;t they took left or right turn?
Love action scene, but this was fantasy beyond fantasy. No american  soldier attack or destroy  a russian base till today.  Even still haven&#39;t a  submarine which  missile launchers  works on that way.  Last mistake if were armed with a nuclear warhead. When did pow was game over.

Anyone else notice that the description says &quot;sends a heat SINKING missile&quot;? One could spend a whole career just pointing out all the ways this is ridiculous.

Dom have 8 life he never dies
Anybody gonna go left or right
Doms car top speed in this scene. Less than 150 mph. <br><br>Heat seeker average speed: 7500 mph. <br><br>Yet dom can outrun it?
Dom jadi jahat?

Just enjoy the action scene logic seeking dumbasses<br>If you used that logic in your life, you wouldn&#39;t be here commenting on movie&#39;s logics

It&#39;s not ridiculous, but it&#39;s still successful.

Goddamn ruiner 2000  missiles

hi
Remember when these movies were about STREET RACING, and not explosions?! How is this still a &quot;Thing?&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=190">3:10</a> what about under the cars?  There&#39;s clearly space for the fire to go under 😂😂
I only saw the first film, 20 years ago.<br><br>...Weren&#39;t these all backstreet thugs racing each other on modified hot rods?  What are they doing with international espionage??
빨갱이약주
Thankfully, the laws of physics were all taken into account, carefully examined and respected throughout this entire movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=14">0:14</a><br>Letty: This b***h is crazy!<br>Me: I agree
Imagine if one of them got there a few seconds late and couldn’t see because of the fire and nailed dom and sent him flying like 50 feet..<br><br><br>At least he is safe from the fire :)
They went from racing to shootin
Haha surprise bi#@*!!
So turning left or right doesnt exist in this scene
They got that damn missile from the same store they bought the missiles from Behind Enemy Lines ....

Every new Fast and furious movie be like<br>One last ride<br>One last ride<br>One last ride<br>One last ride <br>One last ride
Excuse me but since when does Submarines have a small heat seaking missle on it?<br>Hmmmmmmmmm

So I was talking to the screen and said how about we aim at the Sub Instead Of Letty,Ramsey,Hobbs,Little Nobody,Tej,Roman And Dom Please They can’t die

Death quick alate
Fast 10 is going to be about Dom&#39;s group working as security guards to prevent muggings in front of a kwik mart. Because the movies cant get any more stupid, so the directors will just go so far in the opposite direction so to surprise everyone.

Dom acts to good tbh Paul would of done better if he were here
Black Guy: Get us outta here!<br><br>The Rock: Why are you always yelling!<br><br>Black Guy: I have a speech disorder!
It’s just not the same without BRIAN
Lol why you always yelling😂😂😂
Here there is the scene that kill the sin counter
Sorry but thats not how fire works
What a team!!
”That’s not good!”<br>”THAT’S NOT GOOD!”
All those flames would&#39;ve sucked that area clear of oxygen for quite some time. Dang.
1.) Car cannot outrun heatseakers.<br><br>2.) Submarines are nuclear powered.<br><br>3.) Cars cannot block a heatblast to save human life.<br><br>4.) Villains with such anger management issues can never be successful.
Missiles are slow
That may be the dumbest scene I&#39;ve ever seen in any movie ever.  I love it!
Highly unrealistic

kiya bat he very good
It&#39;s pure nonsense that a missile can&#39;t finish sports car within a minutes.

<b>Why Are You Always Yelling????</b> Yea as a matter of fact, he is
I like how all these explosions don&#39;t even start to melt the ice even slightly.
What a ridiculous scene, and I love it.
Every one knows that that damn ice will break into
Are they missandei and Valkyrie
They didnt have enough money to cast the physics in the movie
In case of submarine (with a nuclear war head on it) explosion please search for the closest car to you and hide behind it till the end of the nuclear winter
Y’all letty proud af of Don and he proud af of her😭😩fucken goals
Wait a sec. A Heat-seeker in the arctic?
I thought these guys were just street racers, not elite special forces
That should have burnt them all alive
皆で車を使ってドム守るシーンはマジで名シーン
Hahahahahahaha why are you always yelling 😂😂😂😂😂
I Ship Dom and letty❤️ Like this if you agree.
Best scene
He can lift his car whenever he wants to😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
For some reason nobody has enough rational thinking brain cells to understand that they could&#39;ve literally just drove left or right when that submarine was chasing them. I assume they studied at the Prometheus school of running away from things.
Fuckingly wow!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=177">2:57</a> you can see people in the background
What car is the one that has the red fender the one toretos girlfriend have
I wish paul walker was in the movie, do you wish too that paul walker here?
Fak jad dom is the viner
Why do people have to overanalyze these movies? They&#39;re meant to be over the top. They&#39;re made for entertainment. I enjoy the crazy action just as much as I enjoy realistic, gritty movies.
very cool scene!
I dunno... I know Michelle Rodriguez is a staple of the franchise.. but I just cant like her jo matter how hard i try.. her acting really irks me... it&#39;s always serious with her... I&#39;d be in the seat driving the car looking over like &quot;I ain&#39;t gunna lie... I almost peed myself on that one!&quot;  I guess it&#39;s her complete lack of humor.. it&#39;s just remind me of the whitest white girl acting gangster when she says her lines... I dunno why... it&#39;s like she just doesn&#39;t do the part justice to me.. I like her in other movies.. but this one I just xant... it&#39;s almost like she tries to hard to act cool but doesnt have the slick personality for it or something ... anyone else have that issue with her?

that&#39;s what i called team work
If only my ml teamates have this kind of good teamwork
I like how they don’t just turn and go around the sub instead they go straight
Fun fact: that submarine looks like akula/alfa submarine and it has a nuclear reactor

The way she screams NOW! sends a cold chill down my spine
My favourite seen
I know I sound like a spoilsport but I just can&#39;t stand seeing a Missile having trouble catching up to a car. This makes the same mistake as star wars in that a supersonic projectile becomes slow enough for you to do fancy maneuvers
Hp,h.
This b### is crazy
&quot;That&#39;s my girl&quot; trust. :)
Rocks car was the closest but lettys was first on the spot hell ya
Big explosion
Um yeah no, Dom got burned to death. End of franchise, pack it up, let&#39;s go home.

He is always yelling because he is a scary cat...😂😂😂😂😂😂😄🐈🐈🐈🐈

They would do anything for family
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfXZ9jcX3A&amp;t=103">1:43</a> how did they hear him?lol
