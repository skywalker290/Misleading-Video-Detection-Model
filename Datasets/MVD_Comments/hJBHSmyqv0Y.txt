Leave a like so I get reminded of this awesome song
Missing the one juu when i hear this song😢
माफ करना ...क्यु के हमे इस गीत के लिखावट में बोहोत कुच  कमी लग रही है .. आपने लिखा है कि .. राम पधारे..  सिया और लखन के सात..आप तो हनुमानजी को भूल ही गये.. जब राम अवध लौटे.तब उनके सात हनुमानजी भी अवध में पधारे थे.. और अगर हम  गायक होते  तो पेहले हम पूरी ये लिखी हुई कविता या ये कहानी पढ लेते ..उस पर चिंतन करते .. कोई गलती होवे तो उसे दुरुस्त करते और फिर गाते .. Sorry singers .. it is nice but a very wrong try .. plz  love music from your heart..just dont sing blindly ..

This song is really special for me because, i liked a boy and I always tried to tell him about my feelings but I Couldn&#39;t. He had a gf then not serious but for fun that also made me cry every night. One day e sent me this song. I Don&#39;t know why I thought he also like me. Later he expressed his feelings. And told that he sent me this song bcoz he loved me but scared if we lose out frndship.
