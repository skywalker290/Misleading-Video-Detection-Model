The announcement of iPadOS successfully persuaded me to get a 2018 iPad Pro 12.9&quot; in June 2019, as an update from the 2016 iPad Pro 9.7”. Almost four years of use, it still rocks!<br><br>It works even better with full trackpad and mouse support a few months since I got it, the Magic Keyboard released the following year, and Stage Manager since the last year’s update. It’s been improving in the past few years while I’m using it. With all of these improvements, it has nearly evolved into a computer, compare to when I first got it with “iOS” 12.<br><br>I just wished that it supports external monitor as the M1/M2 models do.

here I am watching on honorpad with its shitty laggy ui, sd425, no software update, wondering when I would be able to afford an ipad😂
Anyone watching it on iPad?
First time owning an ipad as android user. First impression, it&#39;s not very user friendly. Not much freedom.
If they put macOS on the iPad Pro, that would be GODLY
Omg I didn’t know o could swipe on iPad
D grade company...Apple. They have a dumb system who doesn&#39;t understand even the basic requirements. never listen to complaints and suggestions. BLOODY
thanks i telly like the video
iPad OS is what turned me into buying Apple’s tablet.
Sir i m using ixpand sandisk 64 gb pendrive it is not display in file app  as ur usb shown
I wonder if he will ever do a give away 😔
I want that ipad pro but i dont have money right now
will there <b>FINALLY</b> be a weather app for iPads?
In Sidecar Can you use it in portrait mode? If yes How?
This is 11 inch ipad pro right ?
I just got an iPad 7th generation from my school and I’m loving it so far

They always listen, but often too late
But no 4k on YouTube ... Frustrating!
Wow this is amazing really it is
iPadOS was a great a move for Apple
Is this the 11 inch model?
you know steve jobs is watching your channel religiously up in heaven right
E
Does iPad 10.2 inch come with latest iPad os??
The intro for this video is my favourite from him.
Everyone still calls it iOS because it is. There’s only like 3 changes, since Apple wanted it be iOS on iPad, but it does have some really good features tho.
Still dont like that you cant code
Who is here during lockdown?
What’s that beautiful marble cover (?) on the back of the iPad? 😏
Where&#39;d you get that marble &quot;skin&quot; on the ipad?
Ahah
Apple must have whole new teams of people in charge of product development because dam they really are listening
&quot;And I DIDN&#39;T EVEN MENTION MOUSE SUPPORT!&quot; you did.
why: hay , I am a med student from India a and I need an I pad pro for my studies and I don&#39;t have any I pad due to some economic problem and you know how expensive med schools are so if you give it to me it will be really helpful to me. please help me man with an I pad
I bought the new 12,9” iPad and the pencil. but what about palm rejection
Does the apple pencil just stick on top of the ipad magnetically?
Biggest phones - smaller ipad? Surprised your not using 12.9&quot;.

My iPad already got upgraded
This is so cool! Just made my keyboard small😂
Its time for you to make an updated video on the iPad Pro!!!!!!
I would replace my laptop with ipad when i would be able to run android studio and pubg pc on an ipad.that&#39;s it.
I just replaced my old iPad Air 2 with the IPad Pro 12.9. I love it!
The mac and iPad are slowly morphing into each other, eventually they might become the same device and the two categories will be eliminated altogether

If only microsoft would give us real excel, powerpoint, word,... for the ipad
Do you still prefer the ipad vs a macbook if you are on the go? What do you think about uni students?
I want to get this, but is 64GB worth it?
It&#39;s incredible to me that these features have been available from Cydia for years. Why do you think apple are now allowing downloads/file management?
Why is there a skull behind Marques?

Few months ago I made the best tech purchase since my iPhone- I bought an iPad 7th gen (2019). I see all the rave about the Air and Pro, but little attention to the iPad 7th gen. My hunch is this- because it’s not a $700+ iPad or the latest with the new USB-C then it doesn’t deserve any attention. No matter what issues the greatest iPad has (or any product) it’s worthy of great reviews. I think this lends to making unnecessary purchases because a person feels they have to have the best, or be lame.
I draw with a wacom tablet on Windows.....<br>Alright, saving up and selling for an iPad<br><br><br>edit: I did and my shipment&#39;s been delayed 4 times already and I&#39;m still waiting
Can&#39;t wait for a chromebook in tablet form.. Hey M have you heard about the lenovo chromebook duet that&#39;s launching in May 2020?
Could i stream on twich from the ipad pro?
I like this new iPadOS, but still, I&#39;d rather have MacOS on an iPad Pro that has a keyboard AND a Touchpad. Basically Surface Pro but apple style.
i still feel ipad pro should have mac os or atleast a lighter version of mac os..
How do you sign in with apple?
Who is watching this on iPad cause I am…🐝
I&#39;m definitely going with the most basic iPad.  I don&#39;t care to learn  to use the other features.
sooo a widget is an improvement in 2019? i mean ya its great that they added dat but rly? lmao
Anyone tell Him that this iPad is fragile as all heck. <br>Cause Jerry from JerryRigEverything bend tested it and it snapped it in half
if they put the multi tasking on an iPhone I&#39;ll have no choice but be in their eco system
Lanus Ad ??
Same for me except mInEcRaFt
Does the IPad Pro 2nd gen get all of these features?
I don&#39;t really like apple but Damn this one looks good
How get free i phone
has anyone used this with two monitors?<br><br><br>Or am I being too ambitious?
When apple users get the options that android users always have. Its good that apple get off their small silicon valley.
are all these features also on the ipad air 3?
I found my dream tablet😭
The iPad is getting better and better!
The short key board feature, what???
Does anyone know how to make the keyboard into pc layout on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=192">3:12</a>?
I’ve always wanted an iPad Pro. I’m gonna wait until the end of the year to see if Apple updates the iPad but if not I’m gonna get this iPad.
Can we code on the iPad pro? With the new iPad OS
I might be crazy, but this would be cool for the iPhone too
watching with my ipad pro
Can you download directly from your camera now?
Where are you getting the white on white Apple watch band?
How will this affect the previous iPad pro with the home button? I have the 9.7&quot; version and am updating now
and when you put it inside a backpack, is still foldable :DD
yoit
The new iPad Pro is hands down the best tablet for Artist. Drawing with the new apple pencil is so smooth and fluid its better than the famous Wacom. A must buy for any artist highly recommend!
iPadOS is my reason for getting a iPad 7th gen 10.2 32gb wifi only Space Gray.
That&#39;s all super great and so... I am a product designer and love tech.<br>BUT while being aware of so much poverty, wars and hunger in the world... I can&#39;t enjoy all that gadget stuff without a feeling of guilt.<br><br>There is simply something going freaking wrong on our planet!<br>Little children starving to death, while we press and swipe around on some high tech toys for 1000 USD.... keeping us in a sleep of ignorance.<br><br>This cannot be the way !
So is this just the iPad Pro with a new update??
Apple: innovates <br><br><br><br><br>Samsung users: impossible!
You should update your impressions as newer updates to iOS have made iPad pro again a block of screen and the file manager has again been rendered completely useless
What’s sad is this iPad Pro is faster than my refreshed 2018 MacBook Air. Every other moment Apple Music stops, then plays, same thing with YouTube, it stops for some reason, then plays. man intel, what’s the deal.
Road to 10mil :D
Love these videos !!! From India
I’m definitely going to replace my laptop for an IPad pro
Is that the iPad Pro 2018 or iPad Pro 2019
this guy is the goat
Your vids are so good!
Does it have a flashlight???
Bro can you suggest which external storage is compatible and value for money for iPad pro 11
Can we please get an update on how the iPad Pro challenge went for you? Are you still using only iPad?
should I buy the IPAD PRO now or wait till the new updated version??
Marques is awesome to watch, your vids are the best. Thank you for another great and informative video.
Who came here because of the intro
Is that a cover or sticker? The marble like texture looks so good!
This dude really wants it to be a laptop. ITS A FKN TABLET !!
I am married into the Apple® eco system but I thought about leaving and even spoke negatively about how nothing ever changes. Guess I am renewing my vows with these awesome new features and updates ! I gave my Surface Pro to my daughter and went out today and picked this bad boy up for 649.99 for Early Black Friday savings !!! Apple® for life !
I used to love apple. Then they started to get a bit shit and I’ve moved over to windows. But now they’ve started to impress me. At least with the IPad. The MacBooks I’m still not a huge fan. Very expensive for what you get.
Marques, love your videos I&#39;m learning a lot re iPad Pro, roll on 2020 new one! 🙂👍🏻
Hey how’s working on numbers or excel and keynote or PowerPoint in the iPad Pro?
MK I just wanted to say thank you for this review. I&#39;m a student and I&#39;ve been debating purchasing this tablet for myself for a long time. Your review is what finally gave me the push I needed to try it out and it&#39;s honestly one of the best purchases I&#39;ve made in a long time!! You&#39;re the best!
So the iPad can do all the these things that the surface could already do. But they made a totally separate is for it........ Why.
And it even works on the older ipad pros
Please dont over react when you just start reading this. Dont want Mac guys hating on me before you read it all. <br><br>I am not a Apple guy. If anything have been pretty anti Apple and probably converted many iPhone users to android over the last 8 years BUT....<br><br>I have to say something about all the products released this year feels like Apple is now the company listening to their user base and giving them what they want. While looking a what Google is tuning into under Sunder Puchai, it feels like Google is turning into a company that will tell you what you need, ignoring what you ask for. Some might disagree but that&#39;s what it feels like to me. <br><br>I first took real notice when @Jonathan Morrison did all those vids doing video edits on the iPad pro for Dave 2D and others. Then the iPhone 11Pro smashed it out of the park, this Mac Book 16 looks amazing but I have to say the single release this year that made me excited about Apple products for the first time and go to a Apple shop with actual intent to buy is iPadOS. I played around with the Mac and iPad Pro for hours in store but something about the MacOS and myself that just does not like each other. Maybe it is because I just dont know all the shortcuts and features well enough. But the iPad Pro with iPadOS. Wow. I love it. And I its obvious now how the iPad Pro could replace PCs for the majority of people, myself included. <br><br>I see rumors of the next iPad Pro coming soon so ill def wait a bit for that before buying but in the meantime there are still some things I hope they improve on iPadOS, and I believe they will in time. Thing is iPad pro is great for multimedia media including professional work like photo, video or music creation but less so for other productivity like tons of online researching and using that data to feed into spreadsheets or documents. This is where I still feel I need to have a laptops too. So here are a few things I hope they add to iPadOS in future:<br><br>1. I hope they improve the external monitor output to allow multi monitor at more resolutions. Having those black bars on the sides is a bit silly. Even better would be allowing daisy chaining more than one monitor over USB-C with different resolutions <br>2. Improve Mouse Input Support. Nothing beats a mouse to copy, paste, edit info between MS office/Google Docs sheets, docs or presentations and online content<br>3. Google Docs support in Safari browser. Seems its still a bit clunky at times. <br>4. Support more file systems for external storage like NTFS. Last night I plugged a external NTFS drive into the iPad that works on my Android TV and of course it didnt work. I know this is not Apple specific problem. Actually I think I should start a online petition to all big tech companies. It is ridiculous that in 2019 we still don&#39;t have one good cross platform filesystem that all OS support on all devices. Should write to the EU union to force them like they did with documents many years ago. <br><br>Looking forward to buying my first Apple device in future and i hope now that iPads are not restricted by iOS anymore they will add more power features to it to make it a true laptop replacement for all types of productivity.
Bring this over to the iPhone, and I’m sold
Or you could have gone for Android...
What is the cover on the iPad you have?
damn i did not know i could watch this in 4k, just subscribed ;)
The slide over feature is awesome. It’s like having a iPhone inside your iPad.
This guy NEEEEEDS 10M already.
How about a follow up video. Been months... after seeing what everyone else released this year seems like iPad with iPadOS13 seems to be the best compute device in the thin and light segment. Yes including laptops like XPS 13.
What size is this ipad ?
Absolutely for the average person this replaces a computer now (files was the missing element for me.) Most people are just not honest with how they actually use products. I can tell you that I am writing this on which will more than likely be my last &quot;computer&quot; I don&#39;t see a need for one anymore. Once this computer stops getting updates I won&#39;t be replacing it.
Should I still get this iPad or just wait till next year
it seems like everyone is forgetting the fact that nobody cares if your shit ass android tablet has a mouse and keyboard, its a fucking tablet, not a pc, but after all the hate on apple, it decided to join the retarded contest with samsung.
Still have one question though,<br>When they will add multi user profile on iPad Pro’s?<br>Since having a $1000 tablet, that just for one person within the house seams lame!<br>If they do so, I will rush straight away to buy one ASAP!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=345">5:45</a> Holy shit. This would be a reason to switch from my Surface over to Mac. I need to be able to integrate drawing into my desktop workflow. This seems like the smoothest thing ever. I&#39;m really smitten just now...
Apple: king of tablets<br><br>Samsung: king of phones<br><br>Huawei: king of spyware and malware.
I only updated my iPad because my apps started to freeze, YouTube and Instagram videos wouldn’t play, my keyboard wouldn’t work and everything was just being annoying in general
OMG FROM WHERE DID YOU GET THE IPAD WRAP??!! PLS ANSWER
At last ipad will no longer be called big iphone or is it big iphone 2.0...?
Does mkbhd reply to the comments?
@mkbhd What can you recommend for saving all the pictures from years if you use only an iPad not a Mac anymore.
This is just more like an android now. Looks like Apple is finally playing catch up
Are you primarily using the 11&quot; or 12.9&quot;  ipad?
Look at the back of his iPad omg 😮
Hi. I would like to know if you can plug in ordinary usb c flash drive or it has to be Apple certified usb c flash drive?
then why do you need an iPad?
Thanks for a clear and informative video.
Perfect! since I’m starting school soon👏
Great video
why doesn&#39;t apple just make the macbook touchscreen or compatible with the apple pencil
Is this college friendly? I&#39;m starting soon and still deciding what to pick up for class .
what about using microsoft office? how does it fare?
I really like the idea of the iPad and tablets in general but I don&#39;t see myself using them all that often. It&#39;s much more convenient for me to just look something up on my phone real quick if I need to. If I&#39;m working on a work assignment then I&#39;ll use my PC Laptop. I still find myself wanting an iPad Pro, though. Why?
Are you still using your iPad Pro 11&quot; as of today since the making of this video?
Honestly I have a phone with the home button and oh I want the swipe gesture so much
Is it out now
Ok! Now! Has anyone already noticed that the Files app is clearly inferior to the app Documents? For instance, still there is no way to add multiple Google Drives to the available sources, without having to re-login between Google accounts.
Oh no! I have to spend a lot of money!
I think Apple was holding back on ipados bacause they know once people lean towards ipad more &amp; more, there will be no future left for MacBook, &amp; Apple is all about iPhone, ipad &amp; MacBook.
This is it chief!
I think Apple is now back on top in terms of innovation. These are the things that improve everyone&#39;s daily lives, as well as serve as an euphoria for techies like us. Good job on the video! Your voice is very captivating, my man. Chill vibes :)
I have the iPad Pro 10.5 will all these features work w it as well?
You are the best presenter - style, panache, credibility and SHORT !!!!
I’m going to replace my 6 year old ipad with this Amazing iPad
Beware of the latest cut and trim of your videos, all it does is to set an A to B point of play length, it does nothing to cut down on the video file size, all cut out parts are still in place if you’ve accessed the EDIT features and rewind or forward to parts of privacy that you don’t want others to view! Others knew how to access the EDIT feature too!
Using an iPad mini 4 and was worried about updating it. The split screen between two safaris seem repetitive to the split tab safari already had. But overall, the other features seem worth updating for. (Even if I might not get all the feature with this device. LMAO)
You forgot the new volume thing when you lower or higher the volume there’s something on top of the screen and when you hold it you can adjust it with your hands
so they only release an OS for a device they have had for about a decade...
One day the iPad will replace MacBooks. iPad OS signifies the beginning of the end for the MacBook.
btw, I HATE this update. My iPad has so many disfunctions. Like, sometimes, my keyboard won’t pop up so I can type. And, before you ask, yes, my iPad is pretty new. I got it in 2018. And this only happened AFTER THE iPadOS update. Thanks a lot, apple.
Still cannot do the most basic of things, yet all hail the mighty Apple.
iOS 13 and its iPad equivalent finally exhibit the hallmark UX/UI elegance which MacOS is known for. The question is, why did it take this long?  Apple has enormous resources. It can afford the best UX talent. Yet the OS looked like an awkward adolescent for too long.
Hey!<br>What about us with iPad 6th Generation that now have iPasOS 13 and don’t have USB C, are there now lighting to USB A input for us?
Why is his keyboard layout different than mine
Hey Marques, can you please tell if the new iPad Air 2019 support any form of fast charging ?<br>Any suggestions are welcome too.
Still hoping for ipadOs14 to add a headphone jack
Who Is Else Is Watching this in ipad
I don’t if I should buy a iPad or MacBook
Ios file management isn&#39;t desktop class it feels like you are a kid.
Thank you for this review. Quality reportage.
I have a macbook air and im highly considering trading it in for an iPad pro w the keyboard. I’m a sophomore in college would this be a better option??
I originally bought the 10.5 for art and it was great for that and movies, but nothing else. iPad OS came out and now I can literally use it for everything. It&#39;s like a chromebook with better apps. No need for annoying bloat ware and I can use it on the go!
P
Can you plug your iPhone into your iPad and go on iTunes to troubleshoot
Just a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard and off you go. You have fully functioning compact desktop pc.
apple: its like a computer but better<br><br>apple again: its a cheaper macbook
The ipad is actually a suuuper good deal for artists compared to Wacom tablets.
Personally, I easily prefer Samsung&#39;s Flagship phones over iPhones.<br>But iPads are just those products from Apple that seem to have actual relevance. Unlike iPhones, iPads actually introduce incredible features, and I must say, they are well welcomed. Samsung Galaxy Tabs have nothing against iPad Pros.
Love your IPad cover!!
Is your back a case or a wrap? Would love to get it for my iPad. The marble back.
if you need so many &quot;desktop experience&quot;, why don&#39;t you just buy a cheap laptop (pc), oh, you just want apple, and apple laptop are super expensive.
I cant wait anymore when is it going to come out??? Using an air 2 btw
Can I plug a drive into my gen 2 ipad pro?
Is it out yet
I think u just said it right there, the reason they hold back these features for the iPad is to keep the MacBook relevant
When will get the ipados 13 official update?
Honestly android’s more advanced but apple’s quality is soo good 😔🥵
I have the iPad Pro 2 generation do they have iOS 13 for it
S10e user, yeah I just banked on the iPad pro 12.9, hopefully it&#39;s worth the investment
I hope they let the iPad be supported with flash some day. Safari and chrome could do it.
Hey. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=179">2:59</a> how the usb type c flash drive works on iPad? Does type C support apple devices?🤔<br>Please answer
I love all the changes. Can we now, both, disconnect from a WiFi network, AND shut off the WiFi receiver from the control center?
mk, you seems much more happier with this iPad rather than reviewing iPhone 11.
Great Video!!!
Honestly, considering what ALL the ads for the original iPad Pro showed, it’s ABSURD that they didn’t have this Mac/iPad mix out of the box. They made so many ads saying that it was a computer substitute but all it did was go a bit faster, have a pen, and an official keyboard, and that was it. This seems like what they actually intended to do, and honestly, I am kinda mad because I bough a regular iPad when the pro was released thinking there’s no difference, and they relieve this shit 3 years later, right after I bough a new MacBook. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 GREAT PLANING GUYS👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Still waiting for this. When is this gonna happen
what is that beautiful marble skin? or is that a case?
Hey Marques..I’m looking to buy a new iPad Pro, should I wait a month, or buy now?
No they did not listen.<br><b>BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK</b><br>The missing headphone jack is causing all sorts of MISERY for music users.<br>One single USB-C HOLE should no do &quot;everything&quot;. That is silly minimalism.
yesss!!!
I believe ipad pro is the best apple product ever
Looking forward to this! I currently use Duet Display to use my iPad Pro as a second screen for my Mac. It works really well and was created by ex Apple engineers, but I wonder if this will be better.
I hope to see Chrome’s inside app features with iPadOS. If so, I can put my laptop away.
now i can play clash royale AND search up good decks at the same time. great work apple 👏
Hi MKBHD - Have you tried to connect an external keyboard (not the apple Type case) and a mouse to iPad Pro? When I did the same, I see my keyboard is malfunctioning. Please keep us updated if you happen to witness the same issue.
lol i notice my ipad pro is way faster than my X1 carbon 7th gen now. <br><br><br><br>Facepalm wasted money on the new x1 carbon
It’s the same thing as mine ( Ipad x ( 12.5) )
The year was 2019, and one great innovative company invented downloading files to a tablet
Pretty sure I&#39;m going to buy one, thanks for showing me why I would benefit from doing so ❤
Can i put my hand on iPad while im drawing?
I love that you fit so much useful information into an 8min video. Also video and audio quality is top notch. Thank you for such great content.
Watching on the best tablet ever made by far.  The mighty Amazon Fire HD 10!  It will do most of the things that people who buy these overpriced iPads do for a whopping $149.00!!!!
Is iPadOS coming to the iPad Air 2?
If Apple were smart they’d try to hire you.
I just upgraded my ipad... I should have waited for the apple event.
Okay but why is it so cheap , I’m confused
Ipad is the future
HOW THE HELL ARE YOU HOLDING THE IPAD LIKE THAT IN THE THUMBNAIL
I am excited for iPadOS.  I have an 6th gen iPad with Apple pencil.
Damn too bad I&#39;m stuck with the 2017 ipad pro
Can you also connect your external hard drive to the iPad 2018 9,7&quot;? (With an lightning adapter ofc)
98’! You
Serious question... is that a marble skin for your iPad?
How to Connect ipad to mobile hotspot and wifi printer simultaneously
Markass brownie
Hey is that a skin or case on your pro
Finally Apple might sell me an IPad
Android widgets are still much better
Great review ! Marques always a pleasure to watch your videos...much appreciated
Why my iPad Homescreen widget isnt there anymore since i updated to iPad os 13 Pub Beta 2? I have to swipe right to how the widgets
Has anyone found the apple keyboard folio scratches their iPad screen? I’m not sure how I feel about it, but I need a keyboard when I bring my iPad to work.
Why does your keyboard look different then the generic normal apple keyboard
Where can I get that marble skin/sticker!?
Great video. Could you do one on tab s6?  Thank You. Appreciate it
Should I buy a laptop for personal use or Ipad
Got a Windows laptop in dorm, and use iPad pro for my course at the moment. Most of my lectures just involved things like reading slides and writing down notes, iPad could done pretty well imo and it&#39;s way more lighter than a laptop in comparison.
What&#39;s what he talking about downloading apps to sd card?? I am doing it with Leaf 🍃 and iBridge copying and sharing files from iPad Air 2 2015 model..
Apple listening and Youtube congratulating Pewdiepie, what the fuck. are we living inside a simulation?
Hopefully can running FCP X on the iPad Pro in the next iPad OS update
Please tell me when the iPad os is released for public...
Which Size are your IPad?
iPhone 11 gonna be mind blowing. And the new iPad . September 10
Hi. How good or bad is the new os when it comes to editing Microsoft excel and word..?? A video review would be great..
You could download from google drive via files app before..
Now if only I can get wired headphones to work on this thing
What iPad dbrand are you using?
Lmao if there was microsoft word,powerpoint,excel etc. And you can print ur files that would be cool and the ipad can be a replacement for a mac or laptop and to mention that it has a 12x processor
My dad has the ipad pro
Incredible hardware lmao
Does anyone know the date of when this update will be released to the general public?
How do I get IPad os on older iPads
I kinda regret buying the 10.5 iPad now, but I couldn&#39;t justify paying the extra £250 for the pro. I should have just went for it.
Now you have a touch screen Mac
I know this can do photoshop, but with this new update, does anyone know if this iPad can do Lightroom desktop?
Following this video, I went out and bought myself an iPad and Apple Pencil :) . Now I’m just waiting for the OS 13 update to come around and really switch this machine into high mode. Also, I like the granite back on MKBHD’s iPad, it’s straight fire 🔥<br><br>Edit: it&#39;s kinda painful that I can&#39;t code, do app or website prototypes, or any of the &quot;pro&quot; stuff except art. I&#39;m feeling kinda salty rn
I have OS beta on my iPad 👍‼️
I wish they just make it MAC OS! and be able to run Ipad Apps as normal.
Does anyone know if the sidecar will work with the MacBook Pro early 2015?
Still doesn’t support external SSD’s...
8
I think I&#39;m ready to switch completely to an iPad Pro instead of getting another MacBook. This video shows me that I don&#39;t need a laptop.
What cover u are using for ur ipad?... it&#39;s kind of ceramic look.... looking cool.
Wish I could operate InDesign and Illustrator on it.
Can anybody guesstimate what size iPad MKBHD’s holding there? Looks like it could be either of them.
Hi Marques, how do you do “right clicks” in Safari browsers (or any browser) on iPadOS without mouses? I cannot find it.
I have an ipad pro 12.9 256gb gen 2 2017 model.. is it worth it to upgrade to ipad pro 2018 model? Pls help me i need ur opinion. Thanks
When is this coming out?/<br>And how did he get the back of his ipad to look like that?
WHEN APPLE WILL MAKE THERE  OWN BROWSER GOOGLE BROSWER SUCKS YA REALLY
Is that forshadowing a new iPad?
I wonder if the ipad os and the iphone os come out same day in September
Which back cover r you using for this IPad ? Thank you
Can’t stand these scummy YouTubers. They are everywhere. Linus’s the virus, marquee the fascist poluting youtube.
How can I turn that undo menu off, when tapping with 3 fingers? It’s annoying
Where did you get that case?
Wait so how do I get this, I have iOS 12.4 on it and I just got a iPad Pro today
Do we get ipad OS on Ipad 6th generation?
Wow really liking the iPad Pro right now
Time to bin my MacBook and get and iPad Pro.
With the new ipadOS coming, can the ipad be used as a display or a “monitor” of some sort for the nintendo switch? Like hooking up a usb-c hub/hdmi port on it?
Just downloaded and installed the beta.
Hey, can an ipad be used for coding?
Hi from France ! First, thanks for the vidéo, I bought a oneplus 6 after watching those and I never looked back ! I&#39;m looking to buy an iPad, and I don&#39;t know which one to choose.. I will use it as my computer (since my computer&#39;s needs are not huge, notes taking, web browsing, Netflix...) and I will probably go for the iPad air 3, but i&#39;m afraid it would not support new ipadOS functionnalities like the ability to plug an harddrive or USB key and organise files because of the lightning port... Do you think it something the ipad air will be able to do using the lightning connector ? Or should I invest in an iPad pro ? Thanks for your help !
Can we attach external hard disk?
what do u guys think about the whole bending issue with the ipad pro??
Hopefully this will mean we will see software like Illustrator or Photoshop but keep the prices low and we will see more full blown pc games like steam or gog support.
G
How could they not??🤷
how can I download ios13??????
How do I get that skin for the back of my iPad??
So I’m a bit curious, does the 1TB actually have 6GB of ram?
Where’d you get the marble texture back of your iPad?
The 2018 iPad Pro should be able to run macOS. There is absolutely no reason right now that the iPad should not be able to do every single thing a MacBook can do
You can use sad card with iOS 12 ok it’s not the best and you can only read and not write but it works
im just asking for swipe typing on the full sized keyboard
Would all of this work on the iPad 6th gen?
Can you do a editing on the iPad Pro with. iPad os
iPad os is a game changer.<br>I now use my iPad Pro to edit full length movies.
Finally the iPad is getting a proper files manager. However I wonder if it supports the (amazing) feature of being able to be connected (cable, no airdrop) to a computer (PC or Mac) in order to transfer files. That&#39;s a basic but mandatory feature to me.
Anyway apple’s final versions of OS ALWAYS has release with security problems, no matter how many betas they launch pre-final version
aww man at the end you shouldve stood up, grabbed your ipad, and walked out to &#39;go on about your day with just your ipad&#39; haha
What’s the skin you’re using on the iPad?
When is IPados set to release?
Does the ipad os support youtube playback in 4k? Not only 1080p as it does now on ios12.. thank you hope someone will answer this
Where do you get your skins for the iPad
Is the iPad Pro 12.9 Inch going to be getting the ios 13?
i download torrent and youtube videos and play them on mx player . still ipad can&#39;t do that
That intro music is pure ass my man
I really can’t wait for this to be fully released...
Thank You For This Video , This makes me want to get an IPad Pro now!
Great info &amp; perfectly laid out; the DOWNLOAD bit (min. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=270">4:30</a>), tho: before iOS13, nothing stopped you from downoading a file from GOOGLE DRIVE; all you had to do was make it “available offline” and that was that, right?
Loved the video. Learned new things. Today is the first day I only have my iPad and I’m trying to not use my computer. We will see
When will full iOS 13 will come out
iOS 13 is out?
I hope apple sticks with the square like design this one has. Its nice looking
I never wanted an iPad Pro so badly until I watched this video about IOS 13 and thanks for this video!
When is the stable release roll out for iPad pro 2018?
Thanks Markass Brownie!
Am I the only person who doesn’t care about widgets ?
Hello, it&#39;s my first time commenting in this channel, I am an university student but I also work so I&#39;d like to ask you something about the iPad.<br>Now I use an HP envy x360 for taking notes and working, but I was wondering if the iPad could do this at all.<br>I am not complaining about taking notes, but I work using a website, where I have to download CVs (pdf or doc) and open them in a half of the screen, in the other half I have the website. I need to copy text from CVs to the website.<br>Can you please tell me if it is easy to open a pdf or doc and have in half of the screen and if it&#39;s easy to copy text?<br>Thank you soo much for your work.
So now can we connect external hard disks to iPad?
Imagine with neurallink you wouldn’t need a keyboard
I wish they&#39;d put in some kind of app compatibility mode for apps not optimized for iPad that let&#39;s me run it as a iPhone sized widget instead of the stupid looking full screen stretched out look.
In this vid is he using the smaller or bigger iPad Pro
Hey Marques,<br><br>I am planning to replace my old laptop with a iPad pro. I usually type documents, draw, and edit RAW photos. I am confused between 11 &amp; 12.9 inches model. Can you please help me decide which one is better for me?
So when is iPads coming out? And is it coming out for the base iPad latest gen?
Just when I decided on the surface pro....  🤦‍♀️
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=89">1:29</a> What&#39;s a Computer?
I am currently needing a new iPad as my current one is laggy, slow and cracked! I was originally going to try and get the iPad pro IOS 12 but forget that now that I have seen this video! Thank you so much for posting this video because I can&#39;t wait until I am able to get a new iPad!!
Finally I can retire my laptop!
A kidney can&#39;t buy every single product apple brand
Youbrainwash wepaid, ipad
What are those microphones in the back used for??? Is it a podcast Marques??
This is great! I just got my first iPad the other day and I have been a little frustrated at the limitations of iOS but this looking good. I would love to see a snippet tool like OneNote and windows, what do you think?
Glad I subscribed. Well done amigo
why is that guy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=416">6:56</a> always standing there
DAMN it Marques! You don’t know how to disappoint people with your reviews. 😆👌🏼👍🏼
When can I update? I just bought an iPad Pro but can’t get my home screen to have my widgets on the left. Help!
Always be grateful :) thank you Apple. Thank you MKBHD
Is this only for the new iPad or is the update gonna be compatible with the 2017 iPad Pro?
Your the best at telling us stuff
What if they brought back slide to unlock for nostalgia?
Im getting this next month! Ive never been so creatively excited for an apple product!
I just feel bad for all the guys that bought the took the L by buying the tab s4 🤮
I keep coming back to feel poorer. <br><br><br><br>But damn do those iPads look good...
Once iOS 13 beta is downloaded and the final iOS 13 is released, can you download it and be taking out of beta or will you need to uninstall the iOS 13 beta first?
I need a notebook app from apple!!!
my note 9 can do all that
As a lifelong PC + Android user.. I&#39;m actually considering a Mac + iPad for creative uses..
I am a professional musician.  I started reading my orchestral music off an iPad Pro a year ago.  Works great!!!
After watching this i am satisfied now i will gonna buy ipad pro 11 512gb for my studies
Wait, so is iPados (iOS 13 for IPad) out or is it still in beta? If it is still in beta, when is it getting released?
Where can I get this iPad OS
saw a video that he sold his ipad pro for a tab s4 cuz of samsung dex... pray forr himmm OMGG
You could litteraly take 10 year old Honeycomb tablet and say pretty much 80% same things.
I like your marble iPad skin . Where did you get it ?
Does this update work on the 2nd gen iPad.
sooo does it replace my macbook yet? if not, how many more updates till they add finder!! Dx
Is iOS13 live? I just got my device &amp; updated it, but the home screen isn’t the same.
Who has a ipad but is watching on a samsung device?
Android has been using widgets for centuries
The new public beta (v3) is dope!
Will these features in the new ipadOS be available for 1st Gen iPad Pro models?
Hey! Do you think it&#39;s good for uni students whose main activities are definitely reading and writing stuff, maybe manage files? I am planning to ditch my old MacBook Pro for an iPad Pro. My only fear is not being able to use it for essay writing (multiple pages and docs opened and typing 2-3 thousands of words). Please let me know your thoughts :)
I don’t see download manager in my iPad os beta. Why?
Are there any android alternative to this?
where can i get that cover? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=400">6:40</a> ?
So much, but still no handwriting recognition. I could do this 10 years ago on Windows 7. It was awesome for entering Japanese kana and kanji. WHY Apple? Why can’t this be something Apple (with all its money and resources) provide? I guess they are still banging their heads against the wall trying to convince people the butterfly keyboards are “awesome”. Great video though.
And this marked the end for the Android tablets. R.I.P Android tablets we will forget you (From when they started copying Apple as usual - to when they stopped copying Apple and died)
I&#39;m due to upgrading my laptop. Using a 2015 MacBook air. It works fine, but I just can&#39;t help but feel, my workflow will be vastly improved on the iPad Pro. I also travel A LOT!!! so carry a smaller device will be so great for me. <br><br>My work includes:<br>Typing<br>Photo editing (professionally)<br>web browsing<br>Streaming<br>Maybe a bit of gaming (can&#39;t do this on my MacBook air as much as I would like to).<br><br>Anything I should be aware of before I sink in my money into it?
What skin is he using?
I just discovered that if you double right click text with a mouse you can select it by draging over IT.
Okay, now I have a reason to upgrade my from my 2013 iPad Air because it’s not getting the new OS update 😬....<br><br>My old girl served me well for nearly 7 years 😢
Is that the 12.9 inch model?
I just wish it was on iPad mini 2
Thank you Apple for finally listening to us! I want a 12.9 iPad Pro now!
I really want to see a shuffle option in the photos slideshow function the way there used to be. While thankfully... there is an app available in the app store called Random Slideshow... it is very limited with respect to transitions. If anyone is aware of any other app that handles large photo collections quickly I would love to know about it. There used to be something really good called Picmatic by Team Whisky Beavers but they disappeared.
I want this but also want to upgrade my pc’s gpu
Can you export onto your external hard drive yet?
All these updates sound so good. I’m getting the iPad Pro soon. And hope it will bring some more creativity out of me. <br>Smooth presentation man. So great to see.
An ipad that doesn’t have headphone jack is a big no no for me
Desktop class browsing... funny. Was already there. Just tap and hold the refresh button at top of safari. Oh what do you know, request desktop
Is easy mark up with the pencil a thing you can do with Apple Pencil first gen and the 10.5 inch iPP? Please compare iPadOS between 10.5 inch iPad Pro and the new 11 inch iPad Pro with the A12 chip.
I’m afraid to use the multitasking on iPadOS now because once I was using it and the home button, gesture to homescreen, notifications that lead to apps, dismiss gesture, and many other thing didn’t work. I had to just let my iPad run out of battery.
I have a MacBook Air from 2015, i was considering replacing it, should i get an iPad Pro?
Can you give that ipad??
Where did you get that skin?
Have a 10.5 iPad Pro and just updated to the public beta. I’m getting the new iPad Pro in a couple of months. Got to say iPad OS is definitely a welcome improvement. For a beta the OS is surprisingly smooth, quick, just some minor glitches while downloading apps, and the new features are to borrow your word stellar. I’ve also notice video playback improvement on apps  like YouTube over 12.3.1 on my device. Still exploring all the new features. Yeah iPad users will be very pleased come September.
With the update do you think the 2017 iPad Pro is about as good as the 2019 IPad Pro for students
So does this mean that I can’t have iPad os  in the previous version iPad Pro and have to get a new iPad?
lets get Keyboard and mouse this will be the best tech item ever
Please can iPad OS play MP3 files direct from internal storage or from flashdrive?
The title gives the impression we should anticipate a balanced review. However, you only throw nonstop praise. Next time use a different title like “Only the good ...” or disclose at the start that you are sponsored by Apple; so the public are aware you will be entirely one sided.
My keyboard was sequestered to the bottom left corner after downloading the os13 beta. Seeing you “gesture” open, saved me from fruitless research and frustration. Thank you 😎
This is going to be great for the iPad Pro.  But it&#39;s the same kind of stuff that I&#39;ve had on my Samsung tablets for many years already.  The iPad will make much of it smoother though.  I feel sorry for Samsung.  Nobody appreciated it when Samsung adding this kind of functionality to their flavor of Android but now that Apple is copying ever bit of it, people will say it&#39;s all amazing.
You make excellent, intelligent videos that are enjoyable to watch.  You’re definitely in the right line of work.
Thanks for a great review! <br>So excited to try out iPadOS <br><br>Do you know if it&#39;ll work on an 27&quot; 5k 2018 iMac? I hope so
Who is watching this on the iPad os
Marques is the kind of guy you just WANT to watch succeed. He always does an excellent job with his content and is just such a good guy. I sincerely wish him all the best.
Is this ios13 out already? My iPad Pro is on 12.3.1
I use my ipad pro more with ipad os.
What keyboard do you use for your iPad Pro? Apples Smart Folio? Magic Keyboard? Suggestions are welcomed. I do a lot of the hand writing but still need some typing to complete long projects.
Bro.. why you r not doing a review for iPadOS on iPad 2018? @marques brownlee
Mark ass brownie
Apple is such a good company since Tim Cook took over.
Have you noticed any bending on your iPad Pro? I’ve been thinking about getting the iPad Pro 11” but have been hesitant because of all the rumors I’ve been hearing. Thanks!
Hi! Can you influence somehow that iPhone📱 users from Serbia 🇷🇸 can actually use iTunes and AppStore?
My comment on Henny&#39;s channel 6 months ago &quot;Hell yes I was like 😬 waiting for that intro! I think what’s missing with iPad is Apple has to make a PadOS or something. We got iOS, MacOS and we need software specifically for iPad.&quot;
Just 2018 pro?
Did they fix the bending feature?
Will it be on the iPad 2019 air?
Hey guys I have MacBook pro and I am thinking about buying iPad Pro should i do it????
This is a major game changer to very many.
Hi, can i connect my seagate hard drive to my ipad air after updating it to ipad os 13
hOLY SHIITTTT
iPad can do pretty much everything a laptop can, but<br><br>For the love of god update iMovie and GarageBand to what it is like on Mac! It would make the iPad the perfect replacement for my laptop
Does that mean you can utilize an external hd now?
&quot;Mad at Apple&quot;, there&#39;s no question!
Sir can you give.. Me i pad pro..   This is so expensive 😔
I broke my Face Id with this<br>Apparently there’s no fix for it 🥺🥺
same for gen 2?
Finally!!!! So cool! We don&#39;t have to use 3rd party stuff anymore to have the iPad as a drawing tablet.
I got my iPad Pro a couple months ago and I have rarely used my laptop since. In fact, in the past month, the only reason I used my laptop was because I forgot to charge my iPad one night and needed to get some work done. Excited for this new OS!
I’m very impressed.
Wow a bunch of features android has been doing for years and people are going crazy? Ffs
Android already had this years ago. People are acting as if Apple &quot;invented&quot; these
Soon IPADOS gonna kill most laptops and game consoles. Great job, Apple !!!
Signing docs on this would be a dream
iPad is great, its getting more like a computer and it is still a tablet, Windows on Surface isn&#39;t very good software for tablet mode
Now we need more RAM. 8GB is minimum and i even see 16GB coming for an iPad. User Upgradeable please.  Start selling at $3000 and $1000 for a pencil and $500 for an iPad Stand. Love you Apple you are the most precious.
Will the New iPad OS of 2019 work on ipad air 2018/19?
I still don&#39;t see the iPad as a work device. It&#39;s just too much gestures and ridiculousness that comes with it. <br><br>If you want to get real work done on a great device, get a Surface Pro. <br><br>iPad is at its best as an entertainment device. It
i used to be on team apple and recently switched to team android. but looking at this tablet I am actually excited for the tech. That floating app that you can switch to the other apps was kinda cool. a full widget on the homescreen is kinda cool too. not as good as android imo, but still pretty nice. i saw the keyboard minimize in the other video and didn&#39;t think much of it. but when he showed me the swiping, it put things into context. i knew swiping was a feature apple keyboards had now, but I didn&#39;t think about that type of functionality and for tablets, that is very, very cool. Granted, I still hate tablets and don&#39;t find it useful in my day to day life. but if i was to get a tablet, this looks pretty good. go ahead, link me to a good android comparison, ill wait.
would iPad OS work on the previous gen (2017) ipad pros?
Great review! Now I do want an iPad.
I’m a Surface Pro 4 and Huawei Mediapad M5 Pro User...After watching this video I bought an IPad Pro 11 inch and installed iPad OS 13 beta 2 on it and tbh I’m not going back to any other tablet now...
Was Marques Brownlee born that smooth or did he have to put in hours of practice?
mark ass brownlee
Hi!! Love your videos !! Wondering where you got that nice looking marble iPad case??
Wich iPads will get this?
iPad could use mouse now!With USBC or blue tooth.
Why whenever Apple introduces new functionalities to their products (that already exist in the competition for quite a while) people seem to react to it like it is an innovation??
The syncing between MacOS and iPad OS to make it a secondary TOUCH display is absolutely mind blowing. That is huge if you live in the Apple Ecosystem.
Watching this from my iPad Pro
It&#39;s cute that Android has had many of these feature for 11 years lol
Hey Guys,Pls Reply Me When The iPad Gets The Whatsapp Support
🔥 every time
imagine... an iPad working like Android (feature wise)... I dislike iOS for many reasons (it is stupid for a power user, (using the device for productivity is a No No)) now starting with this update it isn&#39;t that stupid at least. xD At least iPad have widgets now and true multitasking.... 2019 xD better late than never I guess. I still wouldn&#39;t get iOS knowing how bad it is on productivity stuff.
what&#39;s on the back side of your iPad ??
I have the older iPad Pro with the Lightning-Dock. Will I be able to use a USB Drive on the new iPad OS?
Gosh i wish one day i had all apple products...
I like that shirt!
Sidecar proves Apple will never give us a touchscreen MacBook.
I think the question really is if the iPad is usable for a number of years if you want to use it as a laptop replacement. If Apple starts to throttle iPads after a few years, then you might as well stick to your laptop/MacBook which normally work just fine even after many years.
i cant update cuz i jailbroken my ipad, and i only have usbc to usbc so i cant connect it to my pc
Us rich people don’t need multitasking on IPads. We just put our old iPads next to our new iPads and use both iPads.
Keren 👍
Apple is not listening per say, they just don’t want to be left behind in addition to the crappy new iPhones compared to what competitors are doing.
we want 1440p
Still doesn’t have mouse support though unfortunately, which makes it not as viable as a computer replacement.
What about a mouse with iPad
Anybody know where I can get that marble skin on the back of the pro in the vid?
This dual screen thing will be the death of the Wacom tabs for Apple imagine zbrush
If my current mac breaks down or I want to upgrade in a sense a Ipad will be make next choice. I mainly read and watch stuff on it. No need for a full on laptop and it looks like Ipad will be a good product to be a replacement.
just got mine, I’m so excited for this update
mark ass brownie
Hey!!!!!! How about an update on your usage with the iPad Pro now with the IpadOS
Is the update available on the 2017 ipad pro?
I’m watching this on my iPad 😂😂
🍎 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 🤖
Apple &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Android
I seriously might get a ipad because its acc pretty good and i can acc use it for homework
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=420">7:00</a> left corner ... Marcus what the hell is that?!
Wheres the mouse update i didnt expect from u this kinda info 😖
Hi, can you review the brydge pro keyboard please
CoV
A review of the Surface tablets could be on the table? The iPad is awesome but don&#39;t like Apple&#39;s closed ecosystem. Thanks!
where&#39;s the impression or the feedback..?<br>I mean does everything going smooth...<br>make a video fast
Is it bad that I use my iPad 6th generation as a laptop for school and play most the time, the pro would be nice but it’s not necessary for what I do with my current iPad right now.
Will flash drive support work for those of use with a lightning port?
Marques Brownlee how many GB is your iPad pro?
I might have to get an iPad Pro...
Apple: Starts to listen<br>People: BRING BACK THE JACK!!! 1!1!1
But it doesn&#39;t solve the biggest problem...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>The Price</b>
Nice video
I got a 13” MacBook Pro two years ago mainly because I do a lot on my iPad...continuity is no joke. However I recently got the new 11” iPad Pro and this thing does almost everything I do (documents, notes, digital art, photo and video editing, etc) better or smoother than my MacBook and windows laptops. Now I spend around 95% of my time on my iPad and 5% on my laptops. Depending on how iPadOS later this year turns out, 2019 might be the year for me to say goodbye to laptops. The portability and performance is pretty much unmatched at its price point.
Apple is changing they&#39;re listening.  They&#39;ll be either doomed or dominate
Hmm nice. I can already do all of these things 200% better on my Android device naively, and about 1500% better with an infinite sea of open source third-party solutions that allow Android to do literally anything you want. (Including the stupid &#39;desktop-class browsing&#39; gimmick, you do know that&#39;s just a toggle switch in Mobile Chrome, even on phones, right? Also I laugh at all the paid &#39;use iPad as your second display for your Mac&#39; apps that are about to go out of business. Sucks to be you. Yeah, I&#39;m an asshole. Eh)<br><br>Okay to be fair, I would actually give Apple a break and &#39;say job well done&#39; here, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that they&#39;re now pushing even harder with the &#39;iPad is basically a desktop OS&#39; complete BS. You really wanna go there Apple? <i>Holds up a Surface Pro 6.</i> You <b>really</b> wanna go there? Yeah, didn&#39;t think so. Oh also, $1000 monitor stand. WTF Apple.
Can you make a video comparing the iPad Pro vs Mac Book Air
Marques I am your viewer I need one iPhone as a gift
I think this is something Steve Jobs would have never done.
Is the second display for the mac exclusive on the iPad Pro? or the iPad Air does also get it?
Also for the iPad air??
Do people actually use safari though?
I have an iPad Pro 12.9 second generation that I just got... can I right now or will I be able to support extra storage without the USBc connection? Still learning how to use this thing lol 😂
How stable would you say the beta is for iPad os?
Don’t forget mouse/trackpad support!! Super cool new feature!!
My 5 years old tablet (7$) can do everything that this tablet can do.... Lol🤦🤦👏👏
I made the jump to iPad only a few months back and it’s amazing. The improvements will take it to a new level.
Noticed you kept that weird U2 album... me too. 😆
All Basic features that should have been added time back not worth the price tag rather just get a laptop
Wait wait wait..... does Marques have a MARBLE back to his iPad Pro?!?! THATS SO FUCKING BALLER
So now can I connect a pendrive or a hard drive and watch movies from it by connecting my pendrive through a dongle which converts the USB into a type C port?
Why not have a Mac book like the surface? Tablet but with a detachable keyboard. Without keyboard it is ios - attach keyboard and you can have full MacOS or iPad OS. I really feel they would kill off surface, whereas now it feels like the restrictions on iPad mean they are losing customers - if anything ipados seems to be moving to a desktop type experience anyway. That being said if I could afford it I would have iPad and macbook
Which ipad is he using ? 🤔
Hope you can anser me question ..just connect an S10+ to ur ipad pro and see if you can transfer files...with usb c to usb c connector. I have an S10+ 1TB edition and i plan to buy An ipad pro 1 TB 11 inch so i will have the best of  both worlds in my hand. Can it do that ? Plz check and get back to me..
Hi marques i had a question can u check with your one plus 7 pro if u connect it to your ipad pro running ipad OS, with a USB C TO USB C does it allow you to transfer files ?
it feels less apply now~
Great job
Is it worth downloading the beta on your main device?
Finally.
Anyway I wonder what Samsung will do with Tab tablet with Android OS? I am sure Samsung is jealous of new iPadOS
Marques I always thought you are an Android fanboy whenever you review Android phone and watch! Now you switched to Apple Watch and Mac.....
Will it be available for the older iPad Pros? I have the 2017 version
I also replaced my MacBook Pro with the iPad Pro (2018) for the mobile device I pack for travel.  I use Rush and Lightroom CC (mobile) for much of my preliminary work.  Then I move the interim work up to the iMac.  The apps Rush and Lightroom CC don’t have all the features I want, but with the very fast chip on the iPad Pro (2018) I get a lot of work done quickly. I can’t wait for the iPad OS (13) to be generally available.  Thanks for the review.
How does his iPad have that marble back with the chrome looking Apple?
Do you prefer the 11 inch or the 12.9 inch?
Add Xcode to the iPad and we will be perfect
Im bark today
Anyone watching on iPadOS
Does ipad OS compatible with other ipad such as ipad mini 5 2019? Or other ipad ??
Do you need to have the newest iPad pro for this to work? <br>I have the 10.5in from last year and I can&#39;t get the multitasking , floating keyboard, or widgets to work on mine..
Can&#39;t wait to hear your update on this Marques. Please share your work flow on your new laptop replacement! Thanks in advance :)
My iPad pro is my favorite device that I own and that&#39;s coming from a lifelong Samsung user
For the first time since a long time that I feel like they&#39;ve introduced some seriously solid improvements on anything at Apple.
It&#39;s a great device, but It bends pretty easily, be careful.
What size ipad pro are you using in this video?
Now if they would only get rid of iTunes....
I’m glad they are going to put a proper file system in..I hope it’s not half baked..also I want to change my controls in control centre..I can’t even disable my mobile data from there at the moment...I use apple but hate their restrictions..I want proper widgets..and please for years, I want to move my apps,around as I choose..
Great video man, thanks so much!
Great review and information. Thanks!!
I swear i saw these features somewhere 🤔 <br><br>Ah yes .. on my Samsung device 3 or 4 years ago!
Should we play cs go or pubg or com games on it??
Oh, it&#39;s actually an iPad now.
What marble backcover is that ? It looks so nice !
What case does he have on the iPad it looks awesome!
I&#39;m confused. You have never been honestly critical about the Ipad cause none of your videos ever brought up the things that thing you finally found magical with the new update. Cotrect me if im wrong. I feel it&#39;s because of reviewers like you that Apple kept pumping out garbage heck! you never even talked about the ipad bend gate in any of your review about the product in question, you just conviniently forgot that was an issue.
🤣🤣🤣oh poor standard iPad users, the only reason you have almost any changes on iPhone or iPad is because they stole EVERY SINGLE NEW IDEA they&#39;ve had with software through the jailbreak community. <br>People have been able to do all of this for years through jailbreaking, it&#39;s quite sad when one of the most profitable companies in the world has to steal ideas then claim its ALL NEW. That is literally the only reason they tried to make it illegal because they knew not a single person can complain if they say you aren&#39;t allowed to do those things then just and up stealing them.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Welcome to 2015 guys.
Нэсквик дело говорит
is the ipad pro good for web developers or for students that are majoring in computer science. i been wanting to buy the macbook pro but it&#39;s to expensive.
Read my name
Sounds like a good plan. Until you bend that thing...
My 2017 13 inch MacBook Pro that I purchased brand new on June 1, 2019, had a failed battery in 13 days. How is that possible?
Can you actually listen to your audio sometimes and understand that your voice is robotic and digital AF?
Who els through the ad was the start of the vid
I’m thinking of getting an iPad Air (2019) but I don’t know if I should get the iPad Pro (2017) instead because it has a couple more features than the air the would be really great bc I don’t want to spend that much money on the new iPad pro
When are they originally releasing????<br>Like IOS 13 FOR iPhones And iPadOS for iPads??
His Hair (face palm)
You need more subs bro.
Is that a sloth sticker?
Dude, didn&#39;t you ever give the subscribers the chance to draw.
The NEW Gaming Computer...<br><br><br><br><br>or Microsoft surface hmmm
i need these updates in the previous gen ipad pro. im rough on tech and i will bend this one constantly.
So. Trippy.
... Or just get a PC Tablet.
why is there no home button
Are these features gonna be on the new iPad Air too?
I wish I could afford it 😓😓😭
Thanks for the video!<br><br>Oh! And where did you get your iPad skin? <br>I&#39;d love to know!
The flexibility 😉
Does ipad mini 5 use ipados?
Do a review of redmi k20 pro,flagship killer
<b>I NEED THIS CASE</b>
Overrated, is the same device, not capable for real pro work. Very expensive just to check social media o youtube. Really far to be a serious device for work.
Am I stupid or are viruses gonna be a problem now because you can plug in hard drives
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=380">6:20</a><br><br>Can you play Yuri’s Revenge on that device?
The floating keyboard and the support of USB drive is my favorite feature
Is that a big trash can iMac Pro at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=411">6:51</a>?
When is this rolling out?
So will the iPad mini 5 support thumb drives?
When Apple finally caved in to the useful features of Android. LOL. 😂
Can I do programming in ipad pro? I&#39;m a computer science student and I&#39;m looking for compact laptop/tablet that I&#39;ll be using for school
I hope someone releases a keyboard like the brydge one but with a touch pad. Use that mouse support.
This dual screen stuff is so lit I can imagine zbrush work on the iPad the only problem is the price of the iPad lol
Oh. They make ot do stuff android have done for years :v ok
When will be available for the rest of as ?
Anyone know if this update fixes how some apps are portrait only when I wanna landscape everything on my ipad I hate how so many apps I have are portrait only on the ipad
Release a stand worth 1k, get bad rep, shortly after release amazing os update, get good rep again but stand stays on store 🤔
Mouse support?
But can you use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse yet?
FYI: it’s been possible to force a page to be fed as a desktop version for a while now (also on iphone) - find the option in the share menu...
Can you download Netflix movies onto the external drive and watch from it?
Dope vidz as always. Can&#39;t wait to know from your experience of using the iPad as your on the go device if its really a device to get for an average consumer
forgive android
This is beautiful, and now I&#39;m gonna buy this.
Finally an update that might make me consider an iPad
maybe wait a little before throwing out the laptop for ipad os beta 1
Mark ass brownie
Ohhhhh i want an ipad pro now!!!
Subtitles says your name as MTV HD<br>LMFOA
That&#39;s why I like surface tablet for desktop like experience
How can I get an iPad for free?
i have the same USB lol
Is this only for the Ipad Pro or is this also for the Ipad 2018?<br><br><br>Thank you
it can not replace my surface book , so ..
still bends.
Wow, finally iPad work like tablet. 😝 Awesome... Uuhuhuuu, took them 6 years to reach Android level.
Typing this on the desktop version on the Safari using iPad OS for YouTube!!!
It&#39;s all about the money money money.<br>We don&#39;t have the money money money.<br>We cannot afford this.<br>Products like thiiiis.
When full Photoshop comes to iPad, THEN it will be a valid computer replacement. Until then...
definitely angry. Angry at Apple. Happy for the experience and for the iPad pro actually working how it should and should have LOOOONG ago, but make no mistake, Apple should be a target for anger for not having done this sooner, business decision or not, fans or not.
Ok...I want to know if Apple put any effort into Notes and Reminders?  Meaning, when I search, I want to have that word or sentence highlighted throughout the notes...much like Evernote.  Reminders needs to disappear when completed and have the ability to assign subtasks.  What has Apple done to improve these apps?
Mkbh now that you Can Connect you’re Samsung t5 to the ipad Pro, what if theres a password om Can you still use it?
Now you can access your our own files on your own device. Revolution!
ipab pro  10.5&#39;&#39; 256gb on the other hand ipad pro 11 64gb how is more powerful ??????
Is the latency reduction applied even for the first generation of Apple Pencil?
Was this shot on the 1D-X?
There&#39;s one important new feature for me in iPadOS. It&#39;s the ability of Safari to save web pages in a .webarchive format. I&#39;d like to know if it&#39;s possible to save to this format without having an external keyboard, where this function is called up with the ⌘S key combination.
Apple. Welcome to 2015
can you make a “months after” review on the ipad pro? i torn between the 2017 and new ipad pro. i want the new one cuz of Usb C and power - but the bend gate is a big hurdle for me :(
Put it a foldable display And I might listen to apple again
I FEEL BAD FOR THOSE ANDROID USERS! - Iphone have ALWAYS been a threat (as is) with the limitations the OS currently have (which is what it was always missing to make it a PERFECT OS, considering the AWESOME security Apple products offers us. Which in my opinion is the PRIMARY thing when using ANY feature from ANY app within the OS. Now that Apple is providing all of this &quot;Freedom&quot; (if you want to call it that), is because NOW they have most likely perfected the &quot;Security&quot; part of it. I see A LOT of Android users transferring over to IOS simply because the &quot;Freedom&quot; part (not being able to do simply things such as connecting any type of drive to the Iphone/Ipad and transferring files from and to the device)  was what was holding them back from doing so. Now that the lock have been broken with IOS 13, the threat is a &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; to the Android world.
This update sounds crazy 🤪, android is never going to catch up 😏...
I like your videos marques. Direct and informative. Thanks!
Plz redmi k20pro
Just a heads up you have been able to run 2 Safari windows simultaneously since around iOS 11 and it’s great, but this is still better as it means more apps support this :)
Marques, what about web tools for developers? For example, such things like web inspector in iOS Safari. Thanks.
Thank you for all your nice reviews. Is it an 11 or 12 inch version you use in this video?
hi, only flashdrive or any other external storage allowed now?
Thank you for the nice review (Again)<br>It was very helpful as usual<br><br>May be it is a time for me to get a new ipad min<br>My mini 2 is 5 years old (Soon 6 years)
Damn, now I want an iPad 🙃
Depressing that we are getting pleasantly surprise over a single instance that Apple finally listened<br><br>It should had been *always listening to consumers*, an expectation of excellence that Apple is notable woefully behind other brands
Wow it&#39;s almost like they are directly copying Android. Oh wait, they have been for like 4 years.
This is better than the iPhone x
am I going to be able to install this new iPad OS on the iPad Pro from 2017?
I really like how you explain things and seem truly excited about the things you are talking about.
Such a great video. Well done dude!
what is the marble like skin/case you use to protect ur ipad pro? looks great
Still trash, never buying an ipad unless they put macOS on it.
Hey what you think is better the 11 inch or 12.9 and Is desktop is available on the 11 inch with iPados
WHEN IS THE PUBLIC BETA?!
Can the iPad read from a USB flashdrive now? (when using an adapter)
Hi sir @mkbhd ,<br>I have a small doubt , I want to buy photo editing app for first time . I confused to buy between these pixelmator vs pixelmator photo<br>Which one is better plz  comment <br>Don&#39;t neglected IAM waiting for your answer sir
Fuckkk!!!! Brilliant
It sounds like this OS will breathe new life into my iPad Air 2 as well as my 2012 MacBook Pro. Maybe even my SE. (help me upgrade and get with the times please)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=64">1:04</a> What’s a computer?
Thats makes me want to buy an iPad pro.<br>But I can only afford iPad mini 2019, wtf.....
I see your video &amp; I juz feel happy. <br>Something makes me !! <br>It gives me More happiness than information !! 😃😃
Bluetooth mouse works with all iPads compatible with ipad os or only with ipad pro?
I have the 11 inch iPad Pro. Im not even a big fan of Apple, but the iPad Pro is incredible.
I love how he never asks you to subscribe ❤️ subscribing just for that
Does this update resolved the ipad pro unresponsive touch issue / touch disease?
Sooo, no mouse support, Marques? Ok then. iOS 200, hopefully.
The second display feature has been available from the Duet app for ages - I guess by Apple releasing it as a feature now means that the people behind Duet don&#39;t have an App anymore?
Tell me anything which A Galaxy Note cant doo
Marques is really happy to have a download manager in a browser huh.. Funny no one thought of that till now!!
Can&#39;t wait to start using my iPad more.
Still, I have to say, I hate this 2:1 shitty ratio
Does it work when editing on Wix?
You forgot to mention mouse support!
Can you do some light terminal stuff, just running simple python script? Or an app to do it associated to the filesystem? <br><br>A lot of scientist or data developers, just use the computer to some light programing and then export the files to a server to do processing on that server, having full safari already solve that problem.<br><br>I know is a lot to ask, but just wondering :)
Hello
terminal
I prefer a Samsung for my phone but Apple all the way for tablets
I don’t have iPad os help I have the newest iPad
Screenshot from the corner shouldn’t just be reserved for the Pencil, but as a gesture. Maybe soon! Am loving the idea of Sidecar!
<b>But can it run DOOM?</b>
Which models of Ipad are compatible with this new IpadOS? Maybe a list of those models is highly appreciated.
I&#39;ve had 3 complaints all along with the ipad:  no file system, no ability to transfer files via card / thumb drive, and the battery is sealed up.  I wouldn&#39;t buy an iPad until they addressed these things.  So now it&#39;s down to a non removable / replaceable battery.  When the battery has worn out, we&#39;re supposed to throw this incredible machine in the trash?  Gee, that&#39;s not very environmentally responsible of Apple, and it&#39;s not considerate regarding people&#39;s finances.  Not everyone can buy an iPad every year or two.  I&#39;m in when Apple lets us swap the battery.
Did he just say &quot;world most packed keynote&quot;? Lolz😩😂😃😅😆
iPadOS: We have &quot;windows&quot; now.
Hi Marques love your videos!! Could you use a trackpad with mouse enabled?
The community: This thing doesn’t have drive support?? IT HAS A USB C PORT FOR GOODNESS SAKE, IT DOESN’T EVEN HAVE THE ACTUAL DESKTOP SAFARI!<br><br>Apple: Yeah, yeah we’re listening<br><br>The community: No you aren’t<br><br>Apple: here ya go Ipados 13
Is it possible to print from ipados13? (Not airprint)
I wish there were widgets like this on iOS in general
I&#39;ve been using Samsung since the original Samsung Galaxy Tab to the Samsung S5e that I use now, this is nudging me to the Ipad Pro
Might actually look at these now. Finally Apple is stepping SOMETHING up
Well, it makes sense. Apple has used a masochistic approach to providing common sense solutions to the ecosystem since Tim Cook took over.
So I’m starting uni in September, and although this is late and I’ve already watched this video, I wondered whether the iPad Pro was a viable replacement for a laptop/ Mac. I’m studying pharmacy, which from what I understand is not as dissertation based as many other subjects and I thought that the Apple Pencil could be useful when drawing molecules etc. Lemme know what you think.
Whether it supports mouse??
Nvm lol, made it to the end.
Is this 13 in beta?
Wow, all things that Windows can do since windows 8 natively 🙈🙈🙈
I&#39;m buying it.......
Marques, can you do me a fav........Can you read XAVC files from a hdd or SD card created by a sony camera?
Same
Almost a surface pro clone.. use iPads..  still dont like em.. its tuff.. 🤔😎
Is that for iPad Pro only?
Is this still coming out this September ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=426">7:06</a> <br>Apple: &quot;This... ermmmm this is Not what we had intended&quot;😱🤯
So with iPadOS can I now get a USBC dongle and hookup an external HDD and and SD card (at the same time) and back up footage as if I had a laptop?
This is huge. Much needed. Finally separated the iPad from just being a &quot;large iPhone&quot;
Thanks for the video! Can you link to the marble skin you have on the iPad right now??
the multitasking and features on this iPad is better than any other android tablets now.
I have never ever considered getting an iPad just because I have an iPhone, a MacBook and having those two things basically eliminated my need for an iPad. After this, I now want an iPad 😂
they keep giving me more and more reasons to want this damn thing BUT I DON&#39;T HAVE THE MONEY<br>STOP IT APPLE<br>STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!
But we still can&#39;t watch 4K YouTube videos on the iPad Pro :/
And you can use a mouse!
Marques can you try WhatsApp Web and let me know if it finally works on the desktop style Safari. Thank You!!
Definitely no replacement. Not just yet.
Damn feels like apple coming back!
Do people still remember the OG, Marqass Brownlee?
Who else doesn&#39;t really care about apple but watches MKBHD :D
Does the latency affect even the older Apple Pencil and previous iPad pros?
Please review the regular Oneplus 7
Is Mark Ass BrownLee still a thing?
Why your iPad backsides looks like marbles? Where to buy?
K20 PRO
Alright you sold me 👏
Do a video on Macbook air vs IPad pro, Can IPad pro replace macbook air?
Mark ass brownie
I&#39;m Android through and through. But damn you Apple!! MKBHD is slowly convincing me to turn to iPad pro with the new iPad OS. &#39;researching now while cursing Apple and MKBHD&#39;
Everything is great!!! But still very ancient to the Surface pro
Took them for years, but finally.. yeah
High marques can we edit video at 4k with this new update as we do it in macbook Please reply.... After watching this I&#39;m eager to buy it but only if i can edit videos for my YouTube
Time to buy ipad instead of MacBook...
I prefer iPad pro &#39;cause it&#39;s more comfortable❤️
I like your ipad skin!
I can do all that stuff since Galaxy Note 4 ...
First time in years where I would consider owning an apple product.
MB, have you ever edited videos on the Lumafusion app? It would be cool to see a video of yours completely edited on that app. Keep up the great work!
What keyboard will you use with it now!?
whats that on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=377">6:17</a>
Android had mouse support for ages
Does it works in ipad air
Great for geeks awfully complicated for regular folk. Unfortunately for Apple we regular folk outnumber you geeks by billions. Relevance will continue to decline for the broader market
This actually might make me buy an iPad. Haven’t bought one since iPad 3 lol
How does he have the ipad os if its not even released yet?
iPad just went to smaller Macs from bigger iPhones !
I&#39;m not in the apple ecosystem and I&#39;m not looking to hop into it anytime soon. But I&#39;m wanting a tablet that can be my primary computer for note taking in college but no other company is standing next to apple rn and that actually sucks dick. The new Samsung tabs s5e looked nice but it doesn&#39;t support the spen for some ungodly reason. Amy recommendations would. E appreciated
I like this new update. What’s the point of getting a MacBook Air now 🤪
Just ordered one and cannot Wait!😍
I have never own an apple product, after this update I order 11 ipad pro, I&#39;ll leave my laptop at home for now.<br>just my OnePlus and iPad pro<br>well done apple
Do you ever talk about any other tablets besides iPads.
When will the IpadOS be available in the Philippines?
I think that that was a great move done by Apple..  it will slowly but surely improve the iPad experience.
is it just me or they all do the same thing ? only difference is the new ones cost more

Which iPad model are you using in your Video 11in or 12.9in?
Apple giving its users what it should have from the beginning only now and seeing its users loving it is the weirdest thing to watch.
Boy did I see a few Android features on that so called iPad lol
Can you use a mouse there??
I love the skin on the iPad. So cool!
What case is that or just a cover?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=241">4:01</a> - YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be able to use a mouse would be great.
I still want to see mouse support, at least in certain apps, before I switch over to an iPad.<br><br>Edit: Seems like it is actually possible to connect a mouse in iPadOS.
I think I see what Apple is trying to do for the iPad. Apple wants the iPad to be most people&#39;s primary computer, but many people, including me, could not do that because it was missing those basic desktop-class features. With iPad OS, the iPad could finally do that. I predict that more people will buy iPads as their primary computer, not just as a secondary device like before. That said, it still does not replace MacBooks though. The iPad just has the basic functions down for most people. However, MacOS is still much more capable than iPadOS, especially when it comes to pro app support. Yes the iPad can do pro work as well, but third party app support is still limited compared to MacBooks. <br><br>Overall, the iPad is Apple&#39;s primary product for most people who need basic computers that don&#39;t cost as much compared to high end laptops. It&#39;s basically an alternative to Chromebooks and cheap Windows laptops now. MacBooks are still here for the minority of people who specifically need MacOS for their work flow. So while we never got a budget MacBook, we did get the next best thing: an iPad that can be a primary computer.

I am in love with my iPad pro
Hey i need a bit of advice here, so i just got the ipad pro 11 a few weeks ago and I am stoked for ipados, but i am super scared to carry it around in m y backpack, it seems ridiculously fragile, my lte version got a slight curvature on the bottom from the factory and i am worried about it bending in my backpack, any suggestions? I am carrying it around with the folio case but still, one bad move and it could snap
never bought Apple... but the iPad Pro is easily the best tablet after these updates. wish Microsoft would improve the surface
Yes to creator studio on safari !
Can you write to a usbhd or usb c flash stick? Not just read/import only but transfer and read? Cuz you could already plug most memor in with proper adaptor and only import
so basically a chromebook without Linux
welcome to 2015, says a android user to an ios user jajajaja
This update is not available for me.... can someone help? My ipad is an ipad wifi 2017, i live in the netherlands and currently my ipad is running iOS 12.3.1 and it says its up to date...  please help me
Welcome to Android 🤣🤣
The only thing I hate about ios is the price tag  and the camera<br>Edit:not hate but just get annoyed
is he using the 11&quot; or the 12.9 &quot; ?
Can you use joy cons
Fanboy
Xiaomi puts the camera behind the screen, sooner or later the entire face unlock system will be too
Enough with the Apple crap now. Are you gonna review the new flagship killer Redmi K20 Pro anytime soon?
I just wish they would put final cut pro on it
Does this come for iPad 6th gen
Please make a video on the new OP7 Pro camera update
Please do a pixel slate revisited, I am curious if the lagging has been solved by now and if it is a usable tablet by now
very good review! your voice is easy to listen
so over $4000 for a touch screen mac book LOL LOL LOL
Honestly the iPad Pro will never be a Mac replacement until they release a full desktop version of Microsoft office or iWork
Hey, unrelated but will oneplus be releasing a 7t later this year?
Markass brownie
All of this just makes me realize how much of a joke the iPad really is. The MacBook dual screen mode is really cool though. If that was windows compatible it would be really interesting for a lot of people. But thats not going to happen and honestly most of those gestures seem pretty unintuitive. Apple normally makes easy to learn UI and now you have got a lot of gestures which you just learn by knowing them. Its not really obvious that they are there....
“ Computer” <br>Me : XDDDD
Many new features are really a step up and close the gap between iPad and laptops. However there&#39;s still a few things missing. First the gestures on iPad are not intuitives, you got a lot to learn especially for this device. Next, still no user management ! Most family doesn&#39;t buy 1 iPad per user, it such a bummer that you can&#39;t have separate users account on this device. And many others things... <br><br>But still, a great leap in the right direction.
Haven’t bought an iPad in years think I might do it now
Is that a skin on the back .?
I feel like if Marques we’re to have kids they’ll be so spoiled with the new gadgets and everything😂
Is it released?
Mark ass brownie

Hi, are all these functions like the memory stick function available on iPad 10.5 pro as well?
This is superb
Great video, man. Thanks!
I was always mostly impressed with iPads but this is sooo good.
U can already have notes next to notes in notability (in app feature)
I hope my ipad mini 4 will get this update.  I mainly want the full desktop browsing experience on it.
Natively downloading files??? On an Portable device?<br>The future is now
Where did you get your ipad case?
Mark Ass Brownie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=193">3:13</a> oh look! A cheese grater
what case is that u are using.  Looks cool
Uh... thanks for the video, always love your work..... who is the dead guy in the background @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=468">7:48</a> ?
So apple finally &quot;discovered&quot; widgets and split screen, yeey. Hooray
Mark Ass Brownie
will this be just for ipad pro or all newer ipads?
Multitasking, home screen widgets and USB ports usability? Welcome to 2012, iOS users :D
So why don&#39;t you just by a laptop for half the price?
Can we play pc games on it or change the os to windows ?
I personally just purchased the new iPad Air 3rd generation and without iPad OS I’m already using it instead of my PC so much more than I thought. Can’t wait for the finished update in September! :D
Can my iPad mini 3 do dual screen in IOS 12?
Is it that we can only import Photos from the USB or can videos also be imported to the iPad ?
Hey Marques, wait, what?! You could conect memories and USBs since IPad 1. We’ll at least you could... I stopped using that feature cause I loved from PC to Mac, but when the first iPad came out I would conect my camera or USB menores or memory cards and edit pics and export straight from the memory to the iPad
I really want to get the iPad pro but I&#39;m afraid of it bending. Have you noticed any &quot;bending&quot; in your iPad?
Mark ass brownie
I now own an iPad Pro because of iOS 13.
sucks to me, i can&#39;t ugrade to iPadOS :(<br><br><br>using an iPad Air
I can’t wait
i&#39;d say they should&#39;ve had ipadOS from the get-go.  Now that the ipad has finally caught up with Android OS i&#39;m looking forward to leaving my laptop behind a lot more often.  However, if you don&#39;t me asking, do you have issues handling your ipad Pro?  Mine is 12.9&quot; 2018 and i noticed that my thumbpad ever-so-slightly bleeds onto the screen (when holding it in portrait especially) causing my taps to be ignored.  i attribute this to the bezel being too thin all around so there isn&#39;t enough room to hold it without this happening. Could you tell me what you think of this, or even do a video on it?
hey bro , love your videos <br>make sure to update us if the double screen works with Photoshop .... thats the major hold back form buying an Ipad
This almost makes me want to get an apple product
This is the 1st time I feel like buying an Apple product, but hey! I wont..
Mark ass brownie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=240">4:00</a>
Please do a video on the note 10! What do you know about it??
Where did you get that iPad case \skin ??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2iorLuSjOg&amp;t=119">1:59</a> Now we are able to pick an open tab from Safari and place it beside Safari...after the update we can open a new tab from the dock and place it beside Safari.
Only took Apple 7 years after Google to add desktop mode to the web browser. Wait, it&#39;s still not implemented, maybe next year? Seriously though, what the hell? When I initially heard of iPadOS, I thought of a whole new OS but this looks like a new launcher, something Android has done for ages. What&#39;s up with the sidecar usage too, is it just a cloned screen or expanded screen? I thought that would be a cool feature but it looks like what you see on the iPad is sent to the main computer.
Mark Ass Brownie
Mark ass brownie
aspect ratio on point for pixel 3a
Will sidecar work with iMac too.
y are the top bro marques
I still say iPad pro should be running MacOS. Then I&#39;d be interested for both myself and my son&#39;s next tablet.
The grey haired old man has made it clear i am not welcome on his platform. IOS died with Jobs. Zero innovation only copying from apps and ripping features from Samsung. Apple can ESAD
So you can download a video and than watch later.... Huge improvments..
Use Windows
Nice one Mark-Ass Brownlee!
Can I told it though? Call me back when there&#39;s a noticeable crease in the middle.
I can play shooter games ?
It is necessary to get every update in iOS 12 to update to iPadOS? Even on public beta?
2019 world of technolegy ... day after day , we waiting something new ..cool
man you big inspiration , you know alot about this staff phone tablett ....act..keep it up bro ,,, <br>wish i have support from youtubers to grow my channel like y , top bro ...welldone
Skull casually just sitting in the corner the whole time
What size iPad Pro do you have Marques? What do you recommend? And how much space do you recommend getting?
I don&#39;t like Apple products in general, but the iPad Pro + Pencil? Desirable. Feels like they did what Samsung was trying to do with Note tablets. Too bad about that price point though.
Apple didn’t “hold back” these features in some spite-filled conspiracy. it takes time to implement them correctly. like for USB drive access they had to rewrite the USB stack so it doesn’t have kernel access in order to block potential malware from jacking up iOS. etc... craftsmanship takes time.
Will it work with iPad Pro (2017)?
First-time viewer. Thank you for a polished, professional presentation. Also, your fingernails are very well groomed!
do we get dark mode on ipados??
Are these updates only for ios 13 for ipad pro? Or will it be coming to ipad mini and air as well?
I still don’t use shortcuts on my XS or iPad pro I’m just old instead i go to homescreen then on the app I want 😂
Android homescreen x Windows 10 multitasking x IOS program bar
Really cool features and improvements, but like he mentioned, HUGE learning curve.  Apple will have to make sure all these gestures are properly understood
1440p gang wya
Not sure if I just missed it but I think you can also add that there is mouse support now as an Accessibility feature
Apple and good improvement its not happening anymore, there’s always a cheeky trick behind the scene. A new slow down to force you buy newest devices? A different store to buy again the apps you already own? We just don’t know yet
Will this run on the IPad Air 3
Ejj, Microsoft, are you listening? That column view that Apple has had for years and just got announced for the iPad, can you add that to Windows, please? 😊
Hi, do you recommend to download the beta of IPados? Can it damage my iPad Pro if I install it? I read a lot on News app and I would like to have the dark mode.
wow thats amazing
Apple is always years behind Android
This has been done years ago you isheeps always get amazed for old tech.
Also we can connect ps4 controller to play games like fortnite on ipad.
Great explaination video!
Give me the ipad pro 😭😭
Im so excited for this update to come to us <br>There’s so much more things I could do on my iPad and I kinda diEd when u said the dual screen thing cause I’m excited to connect my pro devices all together
The having the same app open twice is probably the best feature for me,  it&#39;s something I use on my pc all the time
I want to selling my nokia 2100,. Anyone interesting?
apple users wow swipe keyboard s nice android users dude, we&#39;ve that for 5 years
what about old ipad pro ? will it support external usb flash storage via lighning usb adapter?
this fake outrage about devices not having a 3.5 mm headphone jack is insane. Everyone&#39;s using Bluetooth headphones anyway. And if you&#39;re a sound nut to that point, don&#39;t listen to music with headphones
it&#39;s starting to sound really insane that everyone&#39;s talking about a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack during the age of advanced Bluetooth. If you&#39;re still plugging in headphones into your device, you have a problem
everyone please stop talking about a missing headphone jack. I don&#39;t care what device were talking about. No one cares about a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
Nice , I like it but I will still buy Surface go because I need real laptop/ tablet.<br>No hate I have IPhone so yeah.
Unbelievable... Still playing catch- up to the Motorola Xoom.
Some of these features mentioned are perfectly possible on a 2018 iPad. You can view two tabs of Safari by dragging  a tab to the side. Also you can edit Google docs within other browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
It&#39;s great to have the iPad as a second monitor. Now we just need a smaller Pro Stand for it priced accordingly...
Marques does a Lew today. Experimenting
This is for all ipads, not just pro right?
But it still folds
I usually use iMovie to edit my videos, but if apple can either update iMovie for the iPadOS to what we we use on macOS or even a video software such Final Cut Pro, I would definitely pick one up.
so wierd that apple let Ipads be &quot;just a giant iphone&quot; for so many years ....
Did the “available offline” toggle in the Google Drive app not work before for you? I get that the native downloads manager should look more reliable but I never had an issue downloading files inside Drive.
Anyone else notice All the iamSLOTH stickers in the background
I think finally Apple has changed. Bcz to survive further👏👏
Szabo Mark sucks
Awesome
I am a complete Android person, but this... I would use an iPad Pro.
I finally feel I&#39;m getting an iPad. Thanks.
Happy with my original iPad pro, but now I am ready to get the new one.  I have one for sale now :-)
Too bad they didn’t listen about iOS for iPhone. Still only 4 apps in the dock. Still no on screen widgets. Still have to have icons in a confined grid.
The monitor feature is really nice. But I have to say, there are so many Samsung Note features that they are just now getting.
So basically a lot of features Android already has... so exciting...
Does ios 13 for I pad support a mouse? if yes, what are my options for buying a mouse for it?
If only xCode works on iPad, I will definitely get iPad for my daily use.
So is it just for the pro line or will the regular ipads get the update?
Okay shoot, edit, render and publish a video using only the iPad.
Apple fans in 2019: omg you can download files from Google Drive now
Widgets, welcome to the party Apple. Even if you like 10 years late.
Has anyone tried ipad os on 1st gen ipad pro?im afraid it will be laggy. 😒
Only God knows why I&#39;m watching this I love tech but I still have an iPad 2 😭
It would be great if you made a video about Google Stadia
Dude you have some great music taste, first Muse then U2? I’m sold😁
Hi! Could you please link where you got your marble skin for your iPad please?
Wow 2 internet pages at the same time and use an usb drive....this feels so Windows 3.11 ;-)
