MAMMY PAPA HE ,MERY JAN AGAR WO MARENGE TO ME BHI MARUNGA AGAR WO JIANGA TO ME BHI JIONGA   SO I LOVE U  MMMMMMUMMY PAPA
It&#39;s should be must seen video, as this video really states some important message for us people!!! And it&#39;s 7 years old video ... But still i find this really important message!!! Which we should understand.
Jab bhi mere papa ka call aata hai.. mujhe to red button dikhna band ho jata hai.. I don&#39;t know log papa ka call kaise cut kr dete hai
Kaash main ye video ke saath relate kr pata, mera baap toh madarchod ha
That&#39;s why you&#39;re my favourite ... No one can replace you from my heart.. ❤❤❤
I agree...with this video.. when they left then we understand their importance.. i lost my dad when I was 18 now I&#39;m 34 and also lost my mother three years before..today we are so much busy on our lives so we always ignore but we don&#39;t realise what we are loosing..they are the God they do anything for us with their unconditional love..which no one else can do in this whole world..God bless their soul in heaven in rest n peace..guys pls do value and giv your time
Fullyyyyyyy relatable with me 😖
😔
Fb
I love you Dad ❣️
Lucky enough to get the phone call from both mom and dad 😊🧿
Mere Sadhvi Aisa hua 😔
i prays god that bb can&quot;t  see this video <br>as his mom dad does not exist
His father looks like struggler ...but still sbse best character ..itte seedhe ...😊😊
Apne papa ke sath kabhi aisa nhi karna chahiye 😢
Papa meri jaan! ❤
I can feel it 😢😢
Dhruv tara best Jodi in world

Bhi emotional kr diya 😢😢
I started crying because of this video
Watching this masterpiece 100+ times in 8 yrs. Still perfect. Most beautiful video of his career. <br>Thanks for likes😌
❤
❤❤❤
So true for my 13 kinda age
😭😭<br>😭😭😭<br>😭😭<br>😭😭😭😭😭😭
😢😢😢😢
It&#39;s been years but still my father is my favorite hero
Hasne aya tha rula diya😅
I am watching it after 7 years
Ye same maine feel kiya ki main papa se durr ho rha hu. Phir jab bhi time rahta hai Papa ke pass main unse baat karta hu. Sab pahle jaise bachpan me khelta tha, hasta tha. Match ke baare me baate karta hu. Acha lagta hai. Aur haa Mera bhi photo 1-2 hi hig papa ke saath me. Kabhi ye sab important hi nhi samjha
Bhai Aapke baat se main agree karta hu. Par mere kisse me Kuch masle hain, mere dad kabhi mere family me present nahi the. Necessities bhi Mang Mang ke thak jaate the, tab jaake dete the. Agar Yun hota ke dad afford nahi kar sakte humein decent kapre pehenwana, accha khane khilwana hum maan jate. Mein Kuch luxury ki baat nahi kar Raha. Saal me ek do Jo functions aate hain Banda tab to Kuch kharidta hain. Birthday main Kuch to Kiya jata hain Banda ko khaas mehsoos Karane ke liye. Wo na Sahi, baatchit Karna, Pyaar ka izhaar Karna in cheezon ki to umeed rakh sakhte hain. Par dad ko Fursat kaha. Hum 3 Bhai behen hai, humne izhar bhi Kiya hai par koi change nahi dikhi. Main 2 mahine bad 18 hone jaa Raha hoon, mene khud se kayi bar Koshish ki hai baat Karne ki, par jaise thi waise hi Rahi. Main apni qismat se Sila kar Chuka hoon, bas ek gam hain Jo chupi rehti hain, phir jab ese videos dekhta hoon to gam phir Jagah kar leta hain.
I lost my father 😭 last month 💔😭😭😭😭
Old is gold 🥲

This is the first video that makes me cry  his other videos are funny
This is the only guy which makes us laugh and cry at the same time 😞
after watching this video i realized that i dont even talk with my father properly...as i am maturing now i realize that its important to talk them correctly.
The hardest part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FvSia64Y_g&amp;t=195">3:15</a>
😢😢
BB yaar aap rula deta ho kabhi kabhi. Great video !
Sorry for the comment but nowadays we come for the news of suicide and all its not because people lost their hope it&#39;s because they don&#39;t communicate with their parents.<br>Ek baar baat kar loge apne parents se na to kabhi nhi sochoge<br>If you ask what they want they will say only you and your life that&#39;s matters the most so respect your parents ❤❤.😊
The hardest part of this video which made me skip a heartbeat was on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FvSia64Y_g&amp;t=195">3:15</a>

Maine aaj tak kabhi kisi aur ka phone receive karne ke liye mom aur dad ka phone nahi cut kiya.<br><br>Phone cut karne ka faisla hamesha mom aur dad ka hi raha hai.
BB love you
Buvan acting is so real 😢
Dil Ko Chhu Gayi 🥺❤️
Sorry papa
Miss u abu ❤❤❤❤
I don&#39;t know why I am Cray
I would... I definitely would if he loved me enough to visit me even once in his entire lifetime, if he&#39;d think and care that he has a daughter, is she doing okay?<br>Trust me I would
Always respect and love your parents we don&#39;t know what is the last day with them so love your parents everyday
Kya bana diya ye? Rona aagaya<br>😢❤
🥺❤
Heart touching ❤❤
I rarely cry while watching movies, serials , YouTube etc... But this time I bawled like a kid. Maybe because I subconsciously know that I have also been making the same mistakes which Bhuvan did in this video.  <br><br>But I have promised to myself to never ever repeat them again. <br><br>Thanks Bhuvan for this video ❤️ It was much needed to shake, awake my subconscious !
my father was dead in 2021😭😭😭😭
So true about the childrens now a days... really this video made me cry...Dil choliya bb bro apne ..sachai samne laah di .❤
My father was a terrible person, divorcedc, alcoholic and abusive, he passed away last year, and I couldn’t even shed a single tear, now, 6 months later, it hits so hard ki “papa chale gaye”
😢😢😢😢
Yah video ful match ho rahi hai meri life ke sath 😢

😢😢😢😢😢
He never fail to make us laugh  as well as emotional
Nice 😢

Ultimate
Everyone tells each other about appreciating parents,what about sons and daughters,There are parents in the world who just dont care about their children and their will and their studies,I am from Pakistan and I have 2 sisters which are both the eldest,My parents poured their heart and soul into their education and marriage but when I am at that stage where I need to study in clg and university,they have told me to take a part time job so that I can complete my studies and they just told me that they can&#39;t afford to raise me even though my Father is in Saudi Arabia he doesn&#39;t send money home that much I started a campaign to help raise money for my education but people just tell you that your parents should be the one to pay for it but I can&#39;t tell them that my parents are the one making me take part time jobs and earm for my self at the early age of 16,I am not ungrateful but come on you did better for your daughters but you can&#39;t do anything for your one and only Son  Now at the age of 17 I am doing a full time job and making ends meet,I am not studying I am just working as a shopkeeper at a local store,The point is everyone talks about parents but noone talks about children and their opinions even though they are the future,If you read through this please whenever you see a kid just do something that would make him happy,you dont know what is going through his life no matter the age
I am seeing this video for the second time.. last time when I saw my father was alive.  Now I can relate to this video word by word.. so much relatable 😪
Why didn&#39;t I watch it 1 year ago😢😭<br>Time matters.
Missed his call 😞
😭😭😭😭👏😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️😍😍♥️♥️

Mere me kabhi himmat nahi hui papa ke sath khane ki....kyunki.pata nahi kyu wo mere liye hamesha villan se bane rahe......syd unki aawaz tez thi....ya syd ghar me unki sb mante hai....pata nahi kyu ek azib sa dar lagta hai.

I don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t press like button to such a good video. 1.4 cr people see this video but there are only 9 lakh likes atleast there should be 25 lakh likes.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💔
Connected ❤️
Make me cry🥺🥺
I love you dad

Being alone is Not good. Ask them to who have lost their very close One.
Maruti 800 kaisi rahegi
Bhuvan is always to be my ideal ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bhuvna bhaiya jiska baap hi narak ka saudagar ho us baap k liye kya hi kuch sochna ☹️
Bb bhai is playlist ko continue Karo please bhai please

Act of excellence 💓
He care about his parents  so much I wish they were alive 😭
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
❤️❤️
Not every father is like babluji. <br>Sometime father is such an introvert  <br>That he praises his child in  front of him and disrespect him in front of everyone. <br>Such a mean person he is sometimes.
Pahli bar ye video dekha wo bhi 6 sal purana ,, Har bat jaise dil me utar rahi thi .... Maa bap ke liye kuch bhi kar lo but unke jane ke bad lagta hai kuch kiya hi nahi... Aur bahut kuch kar sakte the ...Mera contact Number me aaj bhi number hai ,,, But ..... 😭😭😭
🥲❤️
🥺🥺😭❤
Dude this video hit me so hard...The lines were so touching
cried like a dog after watching this vid
😭

Ma khush hu Kyunki Aaj jo bhi baat hoti Main Himmat Karke mere papa ke pass jata hun papa se bolata hun papa Mujhe yah dikkat papa Mujhe yah chahie Kabhi Agar vah Din Mein thake Mare Aate Hain To unke pass baithata hun Chhup Kaise jakar unke pair dabane lag jata hun han yah hai ki mujhe Jarur bolate Hain Ki Matlabi Insan aaj kya matlab hai balki mujhe pata hai unhen bhi pata hai ki main Kabhi unke pass matlab se nahin Aaya tab bhi papa ke Puchte Hain per Jab Main Chupke Se pair dabata Hun To bahut khush hote hain lekin kah Nahin paate Raat Mein Main Kai bar thoda let sota hun lekin Aankhen Band Karke to mere pass baithte hain aur Mere Sar per Hath Rakh kar Unse Jaane Kitni baten Karte Hain Ki Beta tu aisa hai beta tu aisa hai han yah Hai Ki Main ko Kabhi Dukh Nahin Hoga Ki Mere Papa Se Main koi baat nahin kar Paya Hamesha Unse Hansi majak Karta Rehta Hoon

Ig i am the luckiest teen who has been growing a deeper relation with my dad right now each passing day.....
Jindagi me kitna bhi important kaam raha ho  kabhi aisa nahi hua ki mene papa ki call recieve na kri ho ❤️❤️🙂
👎👎👎👎👎👎😡😡😤😤🤫🤫AISI GAALIYO WAALI VIDEOS KYA SEEKH MILEGA BACHO KO<br>KAL KE BHAVISHYA BIGAAD RAHE YEH LOG<br>GAALI DETE REHTE KOI MORAL WALI VIDEO BANAO KABHI<br>🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Dil choo gaya yeh video bc.. hope you make more of these veg videos to be shared in family groups..
Not always  he abuses but gives social lessons. <br>Never ever shout on your parents if they are not able to buy something that you want you just speak it out and forget but your parents will feel guilty I request
I can&#39;t imagine how Bhuvan is suffering when he made this video and today his father and mother both are not with him💔😖
When BB said &quot; Firr Papa toh rahenge, Bass phone ki Contact List me&quot; i cried that moment💔
Bhai tune yeh last ke line dil chu gaye
Main bhi 🥺💔
Hutiya 😭
Aaj me itne saal baad yeh video dekh raha hun fir bhi is video ne mujhe ander se jhanjhor diya hai sach me hum ladke apni feelings apne Papa ko btaye hi nhi paate hai... Km se km apni nhi to unki hi baate sune unke pass Beth kar Jitna is duniya me Maa Baap apni aulaad ke liye karte, aulaad apne maa baap ke liye kuch nhi kar paati hai, are jab hum log hosh sambhalte hai or apni job business me lag jaate hai to bahut kam time hota hai unke pass ki wo bhi humare saath har ek pal enjoy kar sake lekin hum sharam ke maare kabhi kuch keh hi nhi pate hai ek bete ko apne pita se gale lagna sabse bada dream hota hai or wo dream reh hi jaata hai jyadatar... Ki haa Papa me bhi aap se Pyaar karta hun me bhi chahta hun ki aap humesha mere saath rahe har kadam par but nhi keh paate hai....
😭
🥺
😭😭😭
This video broke our heart 😭
Here bablu ji is not speaking , Here bhuvan is speaking ❤️

Shadi se pehle us aurat ko ghar le aate aur apne bedroom mein dono door lock kar key rehtey hum bahar.<br>Doosri shadi ke baad humko unhone bola ki unki nayi life hai ab humara aur unka relation end ho gaya hai.<br>Is zindagi mein kabhi unhe contact ba kare.<br>Baap nahi kutta jalad hai mera.
Dil pe lag gaya Sir

Badiya
Jab choti chot lagti nai tab chilate hai mummmmyyyyy or jab truck se accident hote hote bach jate hai tab to mu se baap re hi nikalta hai na <br>We all know the importance od DAD subconsciously but kya kare yaar pappa ke saath rahege to ego ka kya Pappa ke sath shopping karne gaye to me to cool nahi chota bacha laguga<br>Jis ladki ko impress karne or uske samne baap baap bolke cool baneke liye baap ki ijjat utarte hai na ki mera baap yeh mera baap wo.  Usi baap ke pass jaoge jab wohi ladki shopping pe lejane ko bolegi<br>So know the importance of dad or REGRET for the whole life
