It is going to be almost 6 years. Still going good.
It&#39;s been 5 yrs 10 months! Its still a beast in my hand. I really don&#39;t find any reason to change it. All I do is just backup all my stuff every June and factory reset. Boooom! Its a new phone again! I could easily use this for 1 or 2 more yrs
2023 and I&#39;m still using this phone üòÖ
It&#39;s 2023 and I am still using this phone.  I bought it back in 2018. 5.5 years already!
Im looking for a kind of smaler phone. Dont realy need famcy things new phones get these days. Wanted to ge opinions on buying something like this in 2023?
Hello from 2023!<br>Bought mine in summer 2018 and it is the best tech thing I&#39;ve ever had in my life.<br>It&#39;s still in perfect condition. Only have some little abrasions around charging hole. Battery is still great! The only thing that bothers me is that it&#39;s getting slower. However, it&#39;s not even always noticeable. I don&#39;t know if I even want to switch it to a new phone because it&#39;s so mine ‚ù§
have had this phone for 5 years, loved it just switched to s23 ultra and I am already missing my oneplus5T
I am still using now
5years journey
Still going good in February 2023 üòÅüòÅ

Bought it on 2017 and still using in 2023
watching in 2023 in my 5t. 5 years and still good. best phone.
Using OnePlus 5T for more than 4.5 years. Still no problems till date. And watching this video on my OnePlus 5T
So many years... Cracked screen but still using it for another months sss. finally getting another one plus ...  Battery still last me a whole day.  Cameras are weak, but same or even better than newer one plus
Wallpaper is Painted Town - App name - Backdrops.
Watching this in October 2022 on my OnePlus 5T üòÅüòÅ
Still watching this video on OnePlus 5T after 4 years!
I am watching this after 5 years of using this phone. The best phone i have had so far. No lag at all! Performance is same as first day. The battery has aged really well, it still good enough to last a day effortlessly.
Watching this in 2022 on my Oneplus 5T. What a phone it&#39;s still solid and not lagging.
August 19 2022 ok
I got 8gb ram128 internal I can play Fortnite so I&#39;m happy
Still using the same phone. It&#39;s amazing how durable they made the OnePlus 5T.. I wish the current phones (including of OnePlus) were like this.
Lol im still using it, not even a scratch. Only problem is camera, its not that good, and memory its 64 gb only
Still using it in March 2022, I got oneplus 5T -64 GB as a gift from my co-worker, It&#39;s still working excellent. Most of my friends have changed multiple phone over this duration, but their is absolutely no issue with my phone. As you mentioned, all buttons &amp; touch are absolutely working well. <br><br>If you know, how to take care of your devices, it&#39;s gonna last long.
I&#39;m going through some of the older videos.. cool stuff..

over taking boy ü§£
Watching the video in my one plus After 5yrs it still works.
Still strong on my 5T lol
Front camera no good
Iam now comments at 2021 nov , but stil my phone works well
Every one taking about how the 5t was the goat and from 2019 everyone says the 7t was the last goat me who is picking up the 8 and the only game I want is Genshin impact yeah that phone will fly.
2021 anyone?????
It&#39;s 2021 Aug. 5T is like a wine, getting better with age ‚ù§Ô∏èüòéüíØ
I&#39;m from 2021 and still perform 10/10 üòç
it IS oled.
Watching this in 2021, bought in 2018. No lag whatsoever, best phone!!!
I&#39;m here from 2021, that togetherness of pixels called pixel binning in future 42mp and 64mp cameras will spit out 12mp photos.üòÇ
Still rocking it in 2021 and only just now have I dropped the screen and finally broke it. Will I upgrade? Nah $50 to replace it and it&#39;s still instant to open apps. Best phone I&#39;ve ever owned and it only broke because im a dick head.
5T on 2021 - Polished and Still doing Strong. There is no good reason yet to upgrade.
The Home Screen Wallpaper Purple like
Would Anyone Tell me Where can I download the Wallpaper that is used in the Phone Reply Please
Smooth screen and rapid actions
Using it since Nov/2017.<br>Hoping to use it for one more year.
I want OnePlus to make a OnePlus SE with the body of this 5t I mean, man, this phone&#39;s body is perfection.
I&#39;m still upset Marques skipped reviewing this
March 2021 still going strong just ordered the 9!
Still working fine for me. 8/128
Still working great for me, I bought it soon after it came out and I STILL LOVE this phone.<br>6gb ram is sick. Case free with phone is sick (I&#39;ve had it since I got it) Alert sliders, fingerprint, screen res and size, OS, headphone jack, battery life and fast charging all amazing.<br>Only concern is single fire speaker that gets blocked sometimes depending on which way I play games or videos.
Still using it 2021 February. Works just fine, running Android 10 (6-64). I don&#39;t feel a need for replacement yet.
revisiting üòÅ

Back when oneplus was oneplus
I love this phone. I still use mine. The battery needs a replacement, and that&#39;s about it. Just noticed a few more lags recently but hey, it is a heavily used 3 year old mobile phone. I am happy that this was my first phone.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxet1zLBTM8&amp;t=417">6:57</a> that autotune though
I&#39;ve had this for 2.5 years now and it&#39;s still going with absolutely no problems. Still goes for all day, a few scratches but the best phone I have ever, hands down. Thank you for posting this video that helped me find the perfect phone for me.

YouTube really need to sort things out on what I wanna watch.
Does Oneplus still support 5T?
The phone that I want back in 2017
YouTube recommended me this in Tectober 2020.<br>So I&#39;m here.
Absolutely amazing phone. I still have mine, have dropped it a billions times, screen is crumbled and it&#39;s not even a rectangle anymore, even dropped it in the pool twice. Guess what? Works just as well as it did when I bought it! :D Battery definitely isn&#39;t the same anymore but around 75-80% of the original which is still amazing. Dash charge still works great in this 3100 mAh battery pack. Couldn&#39;t be happier. Just upgraded to a p40 pro for just 400 bucks, but still going to keep this for as  long as I can! :&#39;)
October 2020 and I&#39;m still rocking the 5T (RED 8GB/128GB).  <br><br>Don&#39;t see much of a reason for a new phone.  I see a lot of reasons I don&#39;t want a new phone - notches/hole punches, headphone jacks, glass backs, wireless charging precluding magnetic phone mounts, etc.  No complaints other than a mediocre camera and no waterproof rating.  I can see keeping it for another 2-3 years.  <br><br>I just recommended buying one of these used to a friend the day vs a new cheap low end phone.  For market price ($150-200 as of today) it still blows any new phone under $200 on specs, performance and features.  Not to mention build quality.<br><br>I use both an iPhone and an Android.  I used to alternate upgrading either every other year. Skipped the Android and the iPhone upgrades these last two years. I don&#39;t see upgrading the SE2 any time soon, either.  Why?
Yet a beast..!!
Wow
Does MKHBD still have this phone?
September, 2020...<br><br>Still using this beast. However will replace it with OnePlus Nord because of the battery issues.<br><br>5T IS THE BEST PHONE EVER!!!
Sept 2020.. still going strong.. i love my 5T..
Aug. 2020 and still using the OP5T
Had pre-ordered this beauty on launch day (Nov 2017) - still going strong in July 2020.<br>Easily their best bang-for-buck phone ever?
July 2020 üòçüòçüëç
Im from the future its july 2020 and the phone is still better
June 2020, still using a 5t, still fantastic battery life and absolutely no glitches.
Phone is still  buttery smooth  even in 2020. A week ago got android 10 update aswell. Never had any problems till now. How cool is that??<br> One plus is awesome.<br>Waiting for Oneplus 8 pro to go on sale in India for an upgrade after 3 years. Meanwhile 5t will serve my sister for another 3 years probably..üòÜüòÜ
Still runs flawlessly on android 10.  Cheersüçª
Still using it in April 2020. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Still watching on the One Plus 5T...
Had mine since 2017. Still using it never. Never had any single issue with it. Most reliable phone I&#39;ve ever had. Brought it on recommendation from a friend and have no regrets. Even though my contract has ended I feel like I don&#39;t need to even upgrade in 2020 that&#39;s saying something good!

HI, <br>I like the animations in your videos. Please what is your video editor? and the effects pack you used?<br>thanks for the answer.
This was my favourite phone ever.
recommended in 2019
If you go on any of Marques videos and listen to his intro with the autogenerated captions it&#39;s the funniest thing ever to read what it thinks he says instead of MKBHD
This video made me buy this phone and i am still glad with my purchase.
Now we have a full screen display. Bravo One Plus
Mine is almost 2 years old and still feels buttery smooth and the battery life is still great.
Mark ass üòÅüòÅ
For this Wallpaper, download backdrop app from play store and search for &#39;Minimal&#39; section in left row. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
can buy in 2019?
I would take this even over the iPhone XR or Xs
2017 was the best year for smartphones and tablets
I dnt have this :)
Still using oneplus 5t in 2019 and i&#39;m happy with it. Running on latest PIE and Google Cam port mod has elevated the camera to a higher level.
I still have in on 28th of April 2019 and it still runs like a champ, haven&#39;t slow down till now and got the latest android pie update :D
Using the 5T in April 2019 and it still works flawlessly on android pie‚ù§Ô∏è

Is the headphone at the bottom? ,being a business man, who wears headphones and walk around I&#39;d have to put the phone upside down in mysuit pocket. A bit weird.
What&#39;s the wallpaper your using?
You rock... Im a regular follower of ur YouTube channel...I know u can help me.. U know... <br>Well... Need a piece of information...If u like to support me on this occasion...<br><br>I just need to know about oneplus 5t&#39;s call volume and clearity... Is it up to the mark? I got Huawei... Is it as good as Huawei?<br>In noise can one easyly hear everything loud and clear in 5T?<br><br>Thanks in advance...
Best phone I&#39;ve ever owned. Tried going back to Samsung with the note 9 but it just couldn&#39;t replicate the speed and experience of using one plus. I&#39;m holding out for the OP7

Oneplus 5 Or 5t ?
Still with it now? Considering I could pick this up for ¬£240?
Ya kse hote h
Sir one plus 5t me video calling kyo nhi hote
2019 ...still using this phone with no prob
Shouldn&#39;t 5T be the &quot;little brother&quot; since it came later?
Where to buy this phone? Can someone help suggest some link
Brought just yesterday<br>Everything what I expected for nearly perfect phone for me
Wallpaper name Painted Town
&quot;There is no longer Room for The fingerprint redder on The front&quot; watching this on a OnePlus 6T
i just want to have a copy of that wallpaper
I don‚Äôt have the phone but my mum does
Hey what wallpapers are you using ??
I actually like the rainbowing effect :)
From where i can get this rainbow wallpaper?
Anyone here after one plus 6t?
&quot;1080p doesn&#39;t look bad&quot; of course it doesn&#39;t, quad hd panels are great when it&#39;s a Samsung panel but a top notch 1080p panel is so much better than an average or a decent quad hd panel.
It worth it. I literally bought the phone after watching this video. I&#39;ve bought 2 different phones in past just because mkbhd videos convinced me .
For anyone still considering a 5T, the only negative is the camera. It doesn&#39;t take the best pics. When you zoom into them afterwards you will see some blurriness and a slight oil painting effect. That&#39;s the only negative. I love this phone. Great device to switch to Android with.
Love it... From 1+5T phone
where can I buy one?
The face recognition is easy to hack. I took a selfie  with my wife&#39;s oneplus 5 and held the picture in front of my 5t and the picture opened the phone. So be aware that it may not be as secure as the finger print scanner.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxet1zLBTM8&amp;t=99">1:39</a> at least there‚Äôs no notch
cool wallpaper
Hey...in one plus 6... Is there any built in software through which we can make videos from the photos

Watching this on my OnePlus 5t
With what the 5T brought, anyone else here think the 6T will also be a beast (and probably worth waiting for)?<br>Any thoughts, @Marques ?
The Oneplus 5t costs a 1000$ from where I come from.
Watching on my OnePlus One, looks like time to switch
@oneplus is a dishonest company. DO NOT waste your money on their phones. their customer service is trash. Their complaint and comment site wouldn‚Äôt let me post a review. They quoted me one price to repair my phone and then doubled it once they got the phone.
Turbo Charge?
Thanks to 3.5 jack available can use my Audio Technica M40X.fcuk notch.
Excellent Review !!!! Thank you.
One plus with nokia pureview technology... üòÑ
I am a huge fan of you bro!
Could you please tell me where can I find the wallpaper that you are using?<br>It&#39;s really cool.

Small besils on that phone half inch ones on mine
hey man ... what is besy for me ..i like gaming a lot ... whta should i choose ... one plus 5t or s7edge ..... does the 1+ has any issue
I dropped my Oneplus 5t in a hot tub for 15 seconds. It was fine I dried it off and kept using it. Perfectly fine.
I love the wallpaper.
How to get that wallpaper?
I feel like if one plus was like 900$, people would be like wow that&#39;s a good phone and would actually buy it.
Where u get that purple theme..please share me..i like that purple!
No thanks..
MKBHD is the GOAT of tech reviews
Bro,please give one plus 5t for free.please
why does it have to look like an iphone 7 plus at the back ... now most of the android phones look like iphone X üòè
OnePlus really put Apple to shame not just because of the speed of face unlock... but because its only using the front camera ONLY! You&#39;d think that with Face-ID it&#39;d be quicker but it just goes to show you dont need all those extra, expensive senors! The 5T&#39;s Face Unlock was even tested and it knows the difference between you and a picture/video!
So 1+5=6 as in iphone 6 or any other phone
I dropped my Oneplus5T from atleast 10 meters high on the concrete floor. The screen is completly fucked, however, my phone is still on, it is still able to charge (I can tell from notification led), and it still fibrates like normal when I get messeges.  <br><br>Is this as easy as getting my screen replaced? Because that seems to be the only thing that is broken. How do I know not more things need to be replaced? And that im not about to waste ‚Ç¨150 on screen repairs when my phone turns out to be dead anyway.<br><br>Ps: It did have a cover.
Loved When you said &quot; it Resembles it&#39;s little brother&quot; üòç
Those who love stock android phones, Oneplus 5T is the best. It&#39;s really fast and have interesting features.
Thank you so much for the Backdrops app! I discovered some amazing wallpapers! üòÑüòçü§ó
I&#39;m still using my oneplus x. I need to update to this haha. I&#39;m glad it has gestures. I couldn&#39;t go without them after having them
I just recently bought this device. It&#39;s overall nice and potent device but earphone voice level is too low. I just wondering is it device&#39;s fault or is it up to earphones? I use earphones which came with LG G4. Which earphones should I use with 5T?
And which color is best you think
Is it having any problem ü§î
I believe it&#39;s a dual sim as well
Whos watching this on a oneplus 5t?
This display or the Razer Phone&#39;s?
Watching on one plus 5t
One plus and Motorola have always been the low cost flagship killers, owned one of both phones. Amazing bang for your buck, super fast, and fairly cheap.
&quot;Facial recognition! There is not a whole information about thisHOBOBO&quot;

Not every phone is perfect!<br>Oneplus are at their best!
Watching in my  one plus 5t...Insanely fast facial recognition faster than iPhone x ..dash charge faster than any other phone on the planet upto now ..

My OnePlus 5 went through a washing machine and survived.
I swear this guy got 11 dicks!
Who think OnePlus2 are better here?
Link for your wallpaper please.
Should I wait for one plus 6 or should I just buy one plus 5t<br>
Worst display and front look
I have never seen a üåà
I hate Apple - But for a reason. They keep removing features and still call their phones revolutionary, but their phones aren&#39;t the main problem. The main problem are the Macs. They are highly overpriced. They cost around 2,500 dollars, and you can find a 400 dollar laptop with the same specs. The only normal Apple product is the iPad, which is ok. Also, the &quot;HomePod&quot;, which nobody gives a crap about is an expensive Amazon Echo<br>/Google Home which you can only use Apple Music with (not Spotify) and, again, is overpriced. Apple also slows down their old devices to make their new products seem faster.
daamn, the way you made this video and how you talk about the product, great work! It‚Äôs very satisfying to watch and you keep it interesting. I will definitely keep watching your videos! btw I think this was the first video of you that I watched, which actually makes me wonder because your content is fyaüî•
&quot;you wouldn&#39;t like this though, it isn&#39;t Oled.&quot;<br><br>Well yeah because it&#39;s AMOLED, which is better, why wouldn&#39;t I like better?
i frickin love you dude you&#39;re most likely the only damn person on this planet who says 2:1 instead of 18:9
Guys please help me ! <br>My HTC One E8 battery is dead and I am thinking of buying a new phone but I&#39;m confused between HTC 10 and OnePlus 5T.<br>(I love my old phone, I have used it since 2014 and so I trust HTC&#39;s quality)<br><br>HTC 10 -<br>Costs 400 USD in India (Cheaper than the 5T).<br>Now it may be a little dated, but it was a flagship when it came out, so I am sure the build will be top notch.<br>But I fear that the new android updates might slow down the phone and its already been 2 years since it came out.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>OnePlus 5T -<br>Costs 492 USD.<br>All the reviews say its a very good phone, but personally I haven&#39;t ever used a OnePlus phone, so I am not sure how good it is in the long run.

Does anyone know if OnePlus will consider making smaller/normal sized phones again or at least no monster sizes? I&#39;m currently using an Honor 8 and that&#39;s pretty much the biggest phone I&#39;ve ever had. I wanted to get the OP 5t so bad but after having a phone with a comparable size in my hand, I&#39;m not so sure if I should get it anymore. I understand the trend is bigger &amp; better (even though I think that&#39;s debatable) but it would be great to have an option that does not take up all the space in my fanny pack ;-)
I bought One Plus 5 few months ago now I want fucking T
I&#39;m not about to let apple charge me 1300$ CAD for an iPhone X so I&#39;m getting this instead.
good review
This guy is so professional when making videos is!
Still waiting the Face recognition review... HELLO??????????? Marques?

It&#39;s sounds like what they&#39;re doing with the 20mp camera is binning. It&#39;s not new technology. We used it all the time in microscopy in order to sacrifice resolution for signal. You add the signals from 4 pixels (or 16 etc) to essentially treat them as one, larger, pixel.
Does USB DACs work on 5T?

I m going to buy it..
No review üò£

s8+ or 5T?
This looks amazing, I‚Äôm going to get this phone when I have enough money.
As someone who owns the original OnePlus 5 I like the 5T but I&#39;m not going to go out of my way to get the 5T - mainly BC I like having an actual home button to some degree.
Trying to choose between Pixel 2 xl, Oneplus 5t, and LG V30. Don&#39;t really care about wireless charging<br><br>Oneplus because of cheap price, fast face unlock, nice screen, and headphone jack<br><br>Pixel 2 because of software, great camera, stereo speakers and water resistance<br><br>LG V30 because of Quad DAC, good camera, water resistance and small bezels<br><br>Pls help meh choose
I want one please!
I&#39;m watching on my one plus 5t
Hey man. Any follow up to the face unlock testing?
Would you recommend this or the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra?
After 3 admirable years with the Galaxy Note 4, i feel i really made a great choice to replace it. Loving the OnePlus 5T so far.
Hi guys! I need some advice about the easyest way to transfer my contacts and data to oneplus 5t from Iphone 6.
Awesome video marques :)! <br>If anyone can give me feedback on my oneplus 5t video that be awesome guys!
Marques do you have news for the winners of your giveaway ? I&#39;m one of them, but have no more response from OnePlus or... you.
That lava Red one plus 5t comes out tomorrow it looks good check it out sir
Isn&#39;t OLED?
Marques, OnePlus&#39; naming system is so confusing. From your experience, would you consider this an upgraded 5 or should they have called it a 6? Damn, I was hearing great things about the Galaxy S9 and I think OnePlus already took my money! I&#39;m using an old 3 but it has proven to be very reliable and the camera takes very good pictures considering it&#39;s not even a dual lens.
Does the phone work on Verizon?
It&#39;s a beast for sure but when it comes to facial recognition it failed in my case . My brother looks like me 70% and guess what it unlocks my phone using my brothers side pose. LOL
I might get this. But first, I need to graduate.
Full Review?
Wish one plus had an infra red blaster

Oneplus 5T grt spec&#39;s with the amazing price point. And I&#39;m started using as my daily drive Thanks @mkbhd fr ur  suggestions, oneplus will be the future tho!!!
Did u get paid
Normal phone buyers: OnePlus, Honor, LG... Cheap and very good.<br>Those guys who think they need better phones than others: Samsung flagships, expensive and good.<br>Those guys who think Apple is the only real phone company still in 2018 and don&#39;t even notice if there are some cheap and good phones out there: iPhone X. Overpriced and not even any better than others
awesome
5.5 inches is enough i think... 6 inches is too big for me
Best smartphone award
My only problem with the OnePlus 5T is that it doesn&#39;t support USB PD, like all of my other tech does.
Could you please share this wallpaper?
5t or s8<br>pls recommend..........
When are you reviewing this beast
when are you doing a full review?
Busted out the Pixel so we could see the speed of the facial recognition time. Details like that make Marques&#39; reviews the best
still not got our full review....
Hi.I would like to know what is your favorite dbrand skin for him. Tnx for the video it was great
OMG DUDE !!! who the fuck will look at their phone from that angle at 2.05 ???
Did they fix the jelly scroll???
Facial recognition is not secure. My sister unlocked my phone ..(she is not my twin)
Do it have slow Mo
What is expected life of oneplus device by carefully handled? Please advise.<br>Thank you
kaalya...
@marques brownlee How does the videocamera hold up if you make a video in a area with loud music? (for example if you would like to make a video of a concert). I own the one plus 3t now and if i make a video of loud music the sound is just shit.... hope you can give me the answer!
Been using the 3t for a few months. Planning on using it until the 6t.
I hope they give us the option to not unlock the screen as soon as it detects our face, much like how Face ID works currently. It would be a godsend so we don&#39;t have that annoying issue of not seeing our notifications
Finally watching from OP5T
havent bought an apple product since the iphone 4s and im not going to start now. this phone beats it in every way.
iphone x - 90000 indian rupees basic model<br>one plus 5t - 33000 indian rupees basic model<br>thats 2.72 times costly. OMG
Can you suggest whom to choose from one plus 5T or Google pixel 2 ??
my big dream is to work for oneplus and i will do anything so it will become true
8gb of ram?
Can one plus 5t shoot slow motion video in 1080p???
I believe this phone is better that the iphone 7 (MY OPINION NO HATE) it&#39;s a big and decent and fast phone üëå
he looks like a black kripparian
It definitely has a OLED Display
Nice
ur a KFC eater
I want your zipper hoodie not the phone! üòÇüòÇüëçüëç
nice...
mkbhd and oneplus: 1080 is okay<br>mkbhd and apple: OMG 1080 IN 2017?? WTFF
I did research and...decided not to buy their phone. What if you have a problem???? They have a terrible track record for customer service. We can&#39;t reward companies with no regard for people after the purchase.
&quot;kept&quot; is a list of  existing features they had from previous phone you included.... it is not a point worth mentioning as an &quot;advantage&quot; for 5t.... it is like saying iPhone X is good because it kept same chip as iphone 8
‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìÂõΩÂ§ñÁâàÁöÑÂ±èÂπïÊÄé‰πàÊ†∑
Damn, would like to have one :P
I installed the wallpaper app..but canot find this wallpaper...kindly tell me the name
Guys I need your help! One plus 5t or Galaxy 8 plus? Please answer
What smartwatches is it compatible with?
good one. Thanks
Saying its good for the price it sounds like its not as good. Its still far better than other flagships
Hope to have this phone. My birthday is near
5t vs Google pixel who is the best smartphone
I watched three reviews of this phone and all of them say the same thing, ‚Äú this is a phone for everyone‚Äù. But as far as I can tell, two of the four major networks do not support it. I personally have sprint and love unlimited data, but I cannot use this phone on my network. <br><br>Why does no one mention that? That is way more important than what type of case to get for the phone.
You kinda look like black SomethingElseYT
full review???????
Buy in today from Amazon ;) excited
Fucking the fucking one! This phone will compliment anyone who loves their iphone!
OnePlus 5T or Galaxy S8 ?
The 5t has a amo-led screen wich has idividually lighten up pixels.
That wallpaper is lit!
Apple spent millions of dollars into R&amp;D for Face ID<br>where as they could just find a way to put a fingerprint sensor on the back and use a face unlock feature like OnePlus.
Really interested in the review for this one! Also thoughts on the OnePlus 6 coming in march? Wait for that one or not
Has the review been up yet?
Hello. Where can I get the wallpaper from ?
How often does oneplus send out updates?
Bro you are American or Indian
One plus is my next phone when my 6s dies.
I came here 1 month ago when I don&#39;t know anything about this tech expert YouTuber. He is damn good.
The 5T is just a rebranded oppo phone which makes sense because One Plus&#39; offices are below/above oppo offices &amp; was founded by former oppo employees
please do a camera test for the oneplus 5t
Your best video ever!!!
I choose technical guruji for latest news od tech
Hey his headphone in backround is moving wire
One way to demonstrate how fast finger-print sensor is, use table mirror. Here&#39;s how.<br>1) Turn the phone around so that video camera is recording phone&#39;s back side.<br>2) Place a table mirror as such that mirror can see front side of phone. So the sequence would be like<br>[table mirror] &lt;---- [phone front]|[phone back] &lt;---- [video recorder|You].<br>3) Ensure video recorder is able to focus both back of phone and table mirror.<br><br>Done.
it looks very cheap
should i buy iphone 7 or one plus 5t??
Great phon ever...üòò
Hey Marq, when is the review coming up
Can u give me one of your phone
OnePlus One user since May 2015 and the phone is still running extremely well! Getting my new 5T delivered in a couple hours and I&#39;m absolutely excited! <br>OnePlus is legendary and will always win, because they listen to their customers which is the No. 01 rule in consumer products such as these. <br>Hats off OnePlus, keep &#39;em coming! ;D
Nice video bro
Give me your hoodie
Got 1 myself. Never loved a phone so much. Why did I even spent so much on Samsung and Apple...
Just bought it, everything I wanted and more. This phone is AMAZING
Is this imported to USA via Amazon ?
Can somebody send me a link to that wallpaper?
I think why 1k people disliked this video ? This is awesome video.. Just give one like yaaarrrrr...
Can you compare it with Pixel 2? One Plus 5T or Google Pixel 2 which is better?
When the review ?
I&#39;m in love with the one plus 5t... Im gonna buy it next week
Which wallpaper is this?
OMG, it&#39;s not water resistant!!
Face recognition works very fast but it costs you a portion of battery life...
Watching this on my Oneplus 5TüòÇ
Plz comment me the wallpaper
And now im just waiting 10 yrs into the future, where ur screen itself is the fingerpirnt sensor....
Can I connect this phone to metro pcs??
When watching videos can you pinch to fill screen?
It should be named iPhone 7plus clown
Oneplus 5 8gb ram or Oneplus 5t 6gb ram???
When&#39;s the review coming?
So excited! My 5T is on the way and im upgrading from an oneplus one :)
So if I was to buy this phone, could I put my T-Mobile chip in it and it still work, or how does that work?
We can&#39;t wait until your full review on this. Love it  post it soon!
Good price but horrible support. If it breaks your better have your own warranty because they will not help.  Also their accessories are really bad.
One plus 5t rs.32.999 rupees in india money by the way I like it.<br><br>I think God help me to win Iphone x please
I like you
Very nice
It doesn&#39;t do speed dialling other than a very cumbersome way, and you can&#39;t silence it other than using a do not disturb function and it appears that you can&#39;t see if you are getting a call when in this mode. The volume control will not silence the phone completely unless you select the do not disturb function. The most annoying thing is that if call forwarding is enabled, you can&#39;t tell if the person you are calling is engaged or their phone is dead. The cut off is instant.
Still nothing on Mate 10 or Mate 10 Pro?
I have one and it&#39;s great. Never looked back.
8gb ram cool
Where is the full review marques?
Does it have google assistant?
Yeah yeah <br>Pixels is so smart <br>Note8 has the best screen<br>Oneplus is a budget phone.blah blah blah.<br><br><br>At the end of the day, Android is android and trash is trash.
Can you connect to hdmi via mhl?
Is that weather widget just for one plus phones or is it available on play store? Please let me know
Seriously, when is your full review for this phone coming up ?

Nice

Will you be doing a full review?
Samsung galaxy s8 or huawei mate 10 pro ? I don&#39;t care about how it looks i just need a phone that lasts long (can&#39;t get other phones cuz they are not avaliable in my country)
If only it had a 5 inch screen..
Which one is better<br>Note 8 or oneplus 5T?
I would seriously want a phone to be fire proof.
Nooo, the fingerprint reader!
Now this is value for money!

Can you please make a full review of one plus 5t? Discussing all the real time pros and cons. Also, would be great to include a smartwatch integration with the phone to show which suites the phone better.<br>Looking forward to it.
Waiting for the full review!!
One plus 5t is nothing against iPhone X
Hi.. need a help üòä. By mistake my home screen menu change means only left side icons available. So can you tell me how to reset home screen menu like home screen of  device in your hand.  I&#39;m missing camera &amp; file manager icons on home screen. So please reply fast. Thanks

Uhhhh. Review please
Please make a detail review of OnePlus 5T
I want to buy this phone.
It&#39;s not that bad
Who the fuck looks at their phone from that angle?
Ignoring screen quality... Should i get this or xperia xz1?
Marques can you send me the phones you are not using
By swiping fingerprint scanner on the back down or up, you can see notifications.
One plus come with lower price than Sumsung and apple
Review please?
I just ordered mine a week ago, waiting to get it in a few days :)
hey brother <br><br>plz do comparison video between oneplus 5t vs sony experia xz premium (oreo version )<br><br>which is better?<br>need suggestion
Hi marques,<br>Can you please provide a full review of 5T?
Why not, from now on, in every review, we dedicate some time to speak about in which conditions the phone has been made and where the materials has been extracted?
What t fuck
the main question here is = Is the camera Better than the Samsung s8?
OnePlus 5T is my phone of the year - 2017
Wish I had bought this phone instead of my s8+, now I am stuck with this samsung shit software :( Gotta love that stock android feeling
Just the Apple logo is worth the extra 400-500$. In my humble opinion.
Do u hav any plan for give away of one plus 5t
Still won&#39;t buy any phone without a headphone jack.
What its camera really good comape other top ended smartphones like iphone x. Pixel 2 &amp; note &amp; lg .v30

what about review of 5t?
Could anyone with this phone help me! I want to list the app&#39;s menu by alphabetical order, so each letter has their own area (like on past models), rather than the apps all being in one big list. I just can&#39;t seem to find the settings for this. Thanks
When, you will reviewing as full review?
How do you check that the second rear camera which you had paid for does actually work and is doing it&#39;s great job or at least to know that its working?
Hey MKBHD, Did you get a skin/case for this phone? I usually go with your recommendations when it comes to skin&#39;s/cases
super pixel tech from nokia 808 they call it over sampling or something
It feels wonderful
Best phone for playing heavy games and PS2 and GameCube games no other phone can do that even the s8 and s7
3T oso fingerprint scanner behind...
Haha people comparing the 5t with ipx , guys you know that 5t&#39;s face wont work in complete darkness right ? i can be hacked much more easily than the ipx ... yes ipx is expensive but people are buying it so it does have something lol , love to see people crying over a phone fight
did ANYONE buy this as yet from the OnePlus Website? How fast was the shipping? How fast will it ship to Brooklyn New York?? Help Please.
Swapped my s8+ for OnePlus 5t 128gb and it&#39;s definitely on par with it..
Still rocking my oneplus3. I&#39;ll wait a few generations.
when are you gonna upload the full review??
Hello Marques,<br>I own a 3T and I recently bought a 5T, I need your help to know if my device/charger is faulty or is it normal.<br>Because when I used to charge my 3T it used to get charged within an hour +few mins  from 0%-100 %. But I checked my 5T , From @12%  (switched off)charged till 94% in 69mins i.e;82% charge. Is it normal.? Can u do a charge test on this 2 devices, or help me sort this confusion. Thanks!
I love my oneplus 5T it&#39;s a great phone for its price. Especially the fast dash charging.
Do you already know when the full review will come?
There are display issues on the OP5T ! when scrolling through black background at low brightness the color gets spilled or the wordings or the content gets blurred.
OnePlus5 features an AMOLED screen, hence MKBHD is incorrect in his statement
You have allmost the same amount of subs Than people in my country
For the price, for the average user, it seems like a very good phone.
waiting for full review
u can change the way facial recognition work in settings.
The low light camera thing &quot;merging&quot; 4 pixels is called binning. We use it in astronomical research with CCDs, pretty much all it does is create a 2 pixel by 2 pixel box, and treats the now four pixel box as one pixel using software. This does mean that with the same amount of light, you get a brighter pixel value, and in addition you also increase the signal to noise ratio. It comes at the cost of reducing the image quality though
Woohoo back finger print sensor. Though I probably won&#39;t be getting one, because I&#39;m sure they still don&#39;t support GSM and CDMA.
R u going to do a full review?
&#39;ve had the original OnePlus 1 since release. And it died yesterday. Ordering the 5T today. I am an example of how to keep and run your phone. none of this fkin i ll wait till plus 6 or i have the 5 and now really want the 5T. dont be stupid. see you at plus 10. bye.
Lmao people comparing this to the iPhone X. This is a phone for people who can‚Äôt afford flagships and wanna feel as if they have one.
The head phone jack is definitely a win üëèüëèüëå
449 with 10% student discount- seems like a steal to me :)
My OnePlus 5t easily lasted 8 hours screen on time on mild gaming, movies and YouTube. Best smartphone I&#39;ve ever had.
give me that wallpaper <br>plz
hey when is your review coming for one plus 5t
the only problem, my 3T isn&#39;t even a year old.
Thanks for the review. It led me to buy my first OnePlus product. Was always a blackberry fan, but they keep dropping the ball. Ironically, I ditched the keyone because the display was trash. And yet the 5t is not far off. The 5T does however have insane specs with face unlock. Happy with my purchase.
Tell me from where the wallpaper please i wanna it in my Samsung..
Yuck such an ugly phone.  Iphooooone x for the win
Does it have wireless Qi charging?
I really like it. I&#39;d buy that ... sadly I can&#39;t as it&#39;s not available in Australia yet
1440p plz
Is the camera Can scratch easily?
please do a full review on onePlus 5 T
Dude! Your videos are great to watch and very informative. Can you tell me where to get that wallpaper you are using in this video.
wow.. 20mp cameras üò±üò±
Doing good against splashes? its doing fine with beeing submerged for several minutes expecially with a case that covers the weakest point...  the sim tray!
@Marques, how can the quick settings be black&amp;white for you and just some of the things have the &quot;accent color&quot;? All the icons have the accent color for me and its a bit annoying.
Writing this from Oneplus 1. Still charming!
Giant killer. Smart, too for keeping the headphone jack
can anyone tell me that wallpaper name i cannot search in the app provided for wallpepaer in the link
I bought one myself and my Brother can unlock the  phone with his face even tho my face ist the only one wich is registered.
Can we still change the buttons??
I am buying oneplus 5T just because of the audio jack
Nicely explained.üòòüòòüòò
Sory im late. Watching your old vid üòÄ
Watching on my all new OnePlus 5t!
i remember a long time ago i watched your video on the moto x pure. Loved it and got the phone but unfortunately, it doesnt work anymore. Im now watching this video and I might get the oneplus 5t
i have a 5 and i dropped it completely submerged in water for a good 2.5 seconds and it was fine just wiped it off and blew in the usb c port to get the water out
Rainbowing Not a big deal at all! Just because there are no other flaws in the phone :P üòÇ <br>If you hate Samsung and apple... Then this is hands down the best !
Facial recognition on 3, 3T, 5 was already available üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Might truly consider it
V30 review, please!!!
got this phone.. looks good so far
Can anybody tell me is one plus front cam  is bad o good ! Cause lot of people was talking about their issue with one plus front came .. N if I&#39;m not wrong one plus 5t has the same came ... So can anybody suggest me ??
This guy doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about.
Should I buy this or LG G6?
I was going to get the Pixel2 XL, but every reason I wanted it this phone does better for cheaper... woops! Sorry google. I think your phone just got killed. :P
When will 5T get front cam portrait mode?
Any news about the Full Review Video?!
The face Id is way more secure then the one plus 5 is
best
OnePlus 5T or S8?
Poda mutta punda
I thought you&#39;d review this phone as you usually do instead of highlighting the features
I don&#39;t understand why the &quot;rainbow effect when tilting your phone&quot; is a problem... Who tilts their phone and thinks &quot;this phone has a rainbow effect here, what a deal breaker!&quot;
Is it worth buying 5t if I already have oneplus 5..??
Review video please.
I think they mean they take both photos from two cameras and combines every 2 pixels from every photo so they became one photo every 4 pixels in one .
Hate protruding cameras üòë
when u love that background but u have an iPhone  üò£üî´
Looks like a paid advertisement.... Disappointed....
But iphonex still got talking donkeys(EMOJI) which oneplus5t doesnt have....haaa
Man u aging!
awesome video
when is the review out
üôãhello
Hay guys, can you please let me know if this Oneplus 5t had &quot;pause&quot; feature in video recording ... ?
FYI the &quot;merging pixel data&quot; for the camera in low light is called supersampling. The Lumia 1020 used it.
Missed it... good review...
Best phone killer
Alright ive got something to say. i sold my oneplus 3 to get the note 8. and i hate every way you enter the phone. the fingerprint, the face recognition, the iris. they are all awful. the fingerprint scanner is soooo slow compared to the oneplus 3 the iris scanner requires you to stare straight at the phone and the facial recognition is slower than the fingerprint. it feels archaic. and i know i could just have nothing and swipe to open but that requires you to hit the power button then swipe the screen open.. every oneplus i had was just put your finger here and it was already open.. no fiddling around no waiting..i miss it so much... i may sell this note...and promise to never stray from oneplus again
best phone in the market im using the oneplus 5
üò±The snappy Beast.üê∫üê∫
When you uploading OnePlus 5T review?
üòâüëå
I wonder if it will work on the Sprint network?
Bought a one plus 3 when it first came out, Awesome phone, and it&#39;s never let me down since purchasing it. Going to wait for the 6T however, can&#39;t wait to see 2018 innovation!
I‚Äôm an Apple person, but this looks really good
Does it have second space/private space?
I want the wallpaper plz
When is the full review?
yo marcus you need to moisturise to even out that black
When will the review come out?
<b>1362 APPLE Fan Boys Disliked this video</b> because they not happy why the HELL it is so cheap than iPhone.
<b>Apple will be happy to sell this at $2000</b> Better Face Recognition , Fast Finger Scanner , Good enough Camera , Cost less than iPhone.
Onplus is the best! :D
Actually  the faster face id isn&#39;t that good. Yeah it is more satisfying and faster, but it&#39;s not more secure than the Iphone and that&#39;s because if someone takes your phone and holds it up to your face, you have less time to close your eyes, look away or something like that. Still i love it and tbh i don&#39;t like the iphone X.
And my one plus x still looks better (in design)üòç<br>I think they should make a 2017ised version of it.<br>Like if you agree!?
Did some color grading involve for this video? Looks orange and teal especially on Marques&#39; face. Great video as always!
Best smartphone budget 2017
Returned my iPhone X, got this 5t. So glad I did.
audio??
When&#39;s the full review coming out!?
It&#39;s an AMOLED display and then you said it&#39;s  not an OLED display?...WTF?!
YOURE IN THE GOOGLE PIXEL COMMERCIAL
Can you please please do a full camera review????
I need a phone for my wife.....was thinking about this phone &amp; the elephone S8.<br>Which is better for the $$ &amp; why?
is it micro sd expandable?
Does it has always on display ?<br>Can the home and back buttons be reconfigured ?<br>To have the back button moved on the right.
OnePlus 5T is seriously awesome...
Finally, a worthy replacement to my dying old pal, The Nexus 5 (2013).
If u just want to check notifications on lock screen. How do u do it?
Oreo just got released yesterday for the 3T so it should also be ready for the 5T
Samsung only the best company that manufacture good and qualified phones really
Who can help me to solve this equation 1+5t&gt;X
It just like Vivo V7 plus <br>90% same
Seriously no stereo speakers? How hard is it to just use the earpiece as a second speaker?
How&#39;s it ..sennheiser cx 180 earphone for op5t???
Sir plz upload the expected release month, design &amp; specifications of Apple IPhone SE 2 üòäüòä
Looking to buy this phone for Christmas, but I‚Äôm not sure yet. I‚Äôll wait for the full review üòá
I upgraded from a Nexus 6p to a 5T. I don&#39;t know if I got a bad 5T but it has the WORST camera I have ever seen on a phone. They come out looking like comic book drawings and they lose a lot of detail. I don&#39;t understand because the photos i take do not look anything like any of the photos i see in reviews or in the keynote. Did anyone else notice this?
Is this phone available on Verizon?
Ok but can we just talk about that white balance though. It‚Äôs so blue
Can you make a review on moto x4?
Looks so much like an iPhone 7 Plus
And the most Ironic part is that Apple X costs just the same ie: the price Apple is paying for each phone is around 300-400$ , even less maybe. I am using OnePlus 3T, and it has never let me down. Although I wont be upgrading anytime soon to OnePlus 5, because i am not financially inept.Needless to say, I will be buying a Oneplus 7/8. Cheerio Apple , you useless overpriced piece of shit who hasn&#39;t innovated since Job Died.!
Its all very well having a great camera - BUT - in the harsh Australian sunlight (and probably the Cal sun), its impossible to SEE what you are taking. Any thoughts on ways to solve this without using deep shelter,<br>Regards one of your 2 mill
Really tired of hearing about how &#39;secure&#39; Face ID is and how everybody else&#39;s isn&#39;t so secure!  It&#39;s a manufactured issue.  My friends tried getting into my Note 8 while I was away from the table with no success.  It can&#39;t be fooled by a picture or a mask, plus I have no twins or patents that look like me.  For what I need, that&#39;s secure enough!  It&#39;s not needed for banking or getting into apps, that&#39;s an Apple gimmick!  Fingerprints are for that.
Try this out oneplus owners<br>Go to calculator<br>Type<br>1 <br>+ <br>= <br>See what happens ü§©
Great review, thanks!
fuckin years and years of the same regurgitated 1080p rez. no android flagship uses a 1080p screen today.
Just bought it
A minute silent for those already bought one plus 5 earlier with the same price üòÇüòÇ
Sounds brilliant if I was not an iPhone user this would be my phone for Android.
Great video! btw the face unlock feature is also coming in the Oreo Update for 1+5 users.
Should I buy iPhone 7 or oneplus 5t?
I don&#39;t really know whether to buy the Oneplus 5T or to wait for the Oneplus 6 which might be released in early 2018..<br><br>It would be nice to get some opinions from you guys :)

Dat wallpaper tho
Was looking for a phone to finally replace my Note 3. Been looking at options, considering a lot of the Samsung S8 or Note 8. But then I found this.
Sexy
Where‚Äôs the Hauwei mate 10 pro review or comparison video? or do you not get payed by them and get free tech? it‚Äôs the best phone of 2017.. Shame
Still rocking a 2014 oneplus one
Coming from a 3t user and loving it ....I am sure this 5t rocks üëç
Just ordered mine
Just ordered one. Never paid that much for a phone. What that bloody black friday does with people  :&#39;‚Äë)
speakers :(
Kya mujhe yeah phone thohfe ke roop me de sakte ho ?
Are bringing a full review??
Marques, please make a full review of the oneplus 5T!!!
microscopy has been using binning for low light images (2x2) for decades lol
Apple and one plus be like - Are Ramesh are Suresh (sasta suresh)üòÇ
Wish they had used their logo as a finger print that would be awsome ‚úåüòé
MKBHT please let us know if you have any comparison in 5t vs Nokia 8:)
awesome bro
looks like a nexus 6
What&#39;s the name of that wallpaper? I&#39;m not able to find it in backdrop!!
I just cancelled my Pixel 2 XL order and ordered the 128gb 5T. OnePlus is delivering 95% of the goods for 50% of the price. I cannot scoff at that value proposition. And since OnePlus offers 15 days hassle-free returns, I just had to give it a shot.
OnePlus 5t vs Google pixel 2?
100 one plus 5t giveaway! Like one plus 3t
Why is no one talking about how just a month ago, Oneplus&#39;s operating system (OxygenOS) was found datamining your phone and setting it off to oneplus for them to peruse... If you have a oneplus, I suggest googling how to either remove the package that sends off that information, or if you&#39;re rooted, you can just install a magisk module that blocks it. Their phones may be nice, but I don&#39;t want to support that kind of practice (just google &quot;oneplus data mining&quot; to see what data is being mined, it&#39;s quite a lot...)
Please sir give me one plus 5t free
Been a Samsung user even since the galaxy s came out <br>Never thought that I would be thinking about buying a phone from a different company until I saw the one plus 5t<br>Only reason I chose the note 8 over it is because I&#39;m with the jump program with tmobile and they don&#39;t have one plus<br>Hopefully next year they&#39;ll have some :-/
Please check how the facial recognition works in low light. ^_^
Am I the only one who badly wants that wallpaper :/
Drag disk industrial fgomg mixture sodium creation welcome pour essence.
is op5t better than LG g6?
I&#39;m liking the idea of picking up the 5t.  Question: will I be the camera situation be a step up from my  Note 4?
really amazing  OnePlus 5T .. And Interesting video .   :) :)
On your video cover it looks like the Google search bar and the lines of the wallpaper form a ‚ÄòT‚Äô letter, like it was meant to be!
Yes, and that makes my LG G2 bezels, 2017 as well. The phone that never get old.
Oneplus 5t seems great. I am still using their first phone. Still going strong though having backdating features.  wanna use this beast. but  :(
&quot;1080p doesn&#39;t look bad&quot; come on MKBHD. 1080p is glorious
Wallpaper link plss
Wallpaper name?
Hey mkbhd, please make a review on this OP5T. I trusts your reviews and i cant wait anymore...
Where do I get the wallpaper?
Now i noticed how way down the navigation software buttons is on this phone when he had it in his hand, might be hard reaching down with your thumb... But i don&#39;t know
Watching on my one plus 5t :)
Happy about the presence of the headphone jack
yes put that illuminate shirt in the binüòâ
I guess you‚Äôre right, 1080p amoled. Not bad at all. I‚Äôve always had this question, how much do they pay you for this
I love how OnePlus can pull off such a great flagship killer at THAT PRICE!
I&#39;m kind of upset of how big of a difference the 5T is from the 5.. I&#39;m going to be stuck with the 5 for a while now... üòí
My brother has the 5t, and I can unlock his phone by using the face recognition. I this this is because that when he set up the face recognition model it was quite dark, so it couldn&#39;t make a very detailed model. Because when he made a new model in a better lit room, i couldn&#39;t unlock it anymore
please make a video about smartphone cameras comparison just like previous video :)
I bought the OnePlus 5T, after 2 hours of using i got 3 vertical lines on my screen, awesome way to start using the phone...dont know if its only me, but only 2 hours of usin already its damaged
Hey Marques, do you wanna give away phones you don&#39;t use any more? Would you like to ship your one plus 5/LG V series /Galaxy series to Georgia the country? I would pay the shipping cost gladly
Great
Watching like a boss on 5tüòÇüòÇüòÇ
looks like oppo r11s
Hey Marques, which one do you think is better: oneplus 5t or razer phone?
Background ios link??
Please review it
What would you guys go for, a brand new Google Pixel 128gb (first gen) or the OnePlus 5t?<br>Recently had a warranty case and got a new Pixel device. Thinking about keeping or selling it to buy a OnePlus 5t.
D: Heeere I come 5T!
Is this phone better then Google pixel
wtf how many phones do you have?
Oh my hell that face ID speed!!
Proudly designed and assembled by Chinese company
OnePlus once gave a hope of &quot;Not every Chinese electronic companies are shit&quot; but I guess they started to show where their root is from. 2 flagship phones under a year and killing the previous one like shit? Seriously? Even a stupid company like Sony does not do that and HECK!! Even Xiaomi does not do that! OnePlus,you went from &quot;Not all hero wear capes&quot; to &quot;Need for speed game series&quot;.
How easy is it to root a OnePlus 5T?
Anybody able to use it on Verizon?? That&#39;s the only thinking making me hesitant to buy it, smh

Are you making a review soon? I&#39;m considering this phone... Would want to see your opinion! ü§î
love your videos, respect your opinions and thoughts on videos, but you should definitely get a (better) pop filter for your mic. please keep up all your videos
How much is it going to cost?
I&#39;m disappointed with their company ever since OnePlus 5.....they are simply a clone of Oppo R11 and Oppo R11s.....they lost their uniqueness
The moment i saw the price i immediately bought it lol
Woah that face ID is just as fast as I Phone X.

What is the best phone you have ever tried
Why can&#39;t they merge logo with fingerprint reader. I don&#39;t get it.
Is that a Nightwing hoodie?
Watching this on my OnePlus 5T
OnePlus 5T ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
Hey Marques could do a One plus 5t Vs iPhone 8 Plus. Thanks  in advance.
Does OnePlus still harvest (collect), your information or analytics data back to OnePlus on¬†the 5T like they did on the 5! If they are then I still hold on to my OnePlus One with¬†Lineage OS Oreo, at least for now.
just bought one today..:D
how to buy this phone from bangladesh??
How about another Blind Test between OP5T, LG V30, IPhone X, Note 8 and Pixel 2XL?
I love this phone. üòç
My Moto X 2014 running Android M has face recognition xD
Please do a giveaway
500 dollars with a facial recognition that is much faster than FaceID which costs you a 1000$?? what the actual fuck
What features? It&#39;s just another bezel-less phone.  Oppo = OnePlus
Geez, I was super impressed with the facial recognition speed.
Hey MKBHD, <br>Need a piece of advice.<br>I am not a heavy camera user. Could you suggest one phone between Oneplus 5T and Samsung S8? It&#39;s super confusing.<br>Thanks.
Dear MKBHD,<br>What&#39;s your view on this ? Is it a good buy ?
Just missing the front speakers, Water resistant, and wireless charger.
The facial recognition won&#39;t be fooled by pictures but not as good as face id. Honestly the s8 brand new on eBay is $580 and you get much more stuff on s8 then this phone
Do a review of xiaomi mi max 2
Do a review of Xiaomi Mi Max 2 !!!
I would guess that if at night the camera combines data from 4 pixels to create one pixel, then you have a bigger sensor area to catch light for every one pixel of resulted picture, which is calculated from the combined four. That might be easier and more multi purpose than do a real night camera like 10mp but 4 times bigger pixels.
They have never been good looking phones, but they work great and are a lot more inexpensive than some of the other brands. They have their niche for sure.
Holds up well to minor splashing??? Every phone in the world holds up well to minor splashing. I‚Äôve had phone dipped in water that still work, which don‚Äôt say anything about water or splash resistance .
Awesome I just got a OnePlus 5 for a friend and I thought it was an awesome phone. But already having the Huawei mate 8 couldn&#39;t go down to a 5.5&quot; screen. I love the Note 8, but find it too narrow and expensive. This has a bit smaller battery than I&#39;d prefer, but think this might be the phone I&#39;ll get next. No sd card but can get away with 128gb, shame there isn&#39;t a 256gb option though
This is my wishlist for the pixel 3. The option for the display to be flat with 90-degree corners and 16 by 9 on all of the sizes and the option for a curved 18 by 9 display with rounded corners. I would like the bezels to be smaller while retaining the dual front-facing speakers and of course, FIX THE DISPLAY ISSUES. Switch to Samsung and use their top end displays and tune the displays like Apple has done. Also, I would like to see a 120hz panel on the display. As for design, I would like to see a lot of aspects of LG&#39;s phones. I want to have the sides not be stainless steel but aluminum and a gorilla glass 5 or 6 back to allow for QI wireless charging. I also want the phone to be IP 68 and not IP 67 water resistant. I also want better vibration motors. I want it to be a linear motor that is on par with Apple&#39;s taptic engine. Also while I am aware that this is unlikely to happen, I would like to see the same high-quality DAC on the V30. While we are on physical characteristics, I would like to see a similar button layout as on the OnePlus 5T with the ringtone silence switch and similar clicky and tactile feedback. But make sure the lock button and the volume keys are not directly opposing each other. Moving on to the camera. I would like to see a dual camera system like on the OnePlus 5T. Have the aperture be F 1.6 on both of the camera sensors and use a similar FFC with optical stabilization on the FFC as well as dual optical stabilization on both of the cameras. I would also like to see a camera that can shoot at 4K and 60fps if Qualcomm can develop silicon for it. As for display sizes, I would like the option for a 5.8-inch display and a 6.3 or 6.4-inch display with a very high battery capacity similar to Huawei with 4000mah or more. I would also like a  512GB capacity and 8GB of RAM. If anyone sees anything they would like to see please mention it. I am sure this can&#39;t be too much to ask for.
the criticism of screen color change at absurd angle is cheap shot
Dude said the shit is so fucking fast it can get annoying!!! Great content &amp; footage!
I honestly think I might get this phone even though it‚Äôs android
I might get this sexy? Looking phone
BLUE?
THERE WE GOOOO CLICKY BUTTONS... what a surprise...
&quot;it could actually get annoying if you just want to check your notifications&quot;<br>there&#39;s actually an option in settings to change it to work like the iphone x, where it unlocks and then you swipe to actually get into the phone. so this isn&#39;t exactly a fair criticism.
@mkbhd when will you put a review of new Huawei Mate 10 Pro?
I wish one plus worked on Verizon, I don&#39;t like the idea of spending $1000 on a phone every couple of years.
Marcus can you please give us a link to that wallpaper and not to the app which contains the wallpaper. I downloaded the app, but could not find the actual wallpaper.
motar
Even OnePlus 3T has the facial recognition. It‚Äôs been there in many android phones especially on Note series from Samsung Galaxy. I have experienced facial recognition on Samsung galaxy Note 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 4 too.
In India 6gb/64gb is 609$ and 8gb/128gb is 671$<br>Fk this<br>Killer flagship yes right -_-
It is an oled screen...
Ok someone please help me!!! I dropped my phone on the bath for about 1 second!!!! Everything works fine so far, charging and the headphone jack...BUT THE SPEAKERS DONT WORK!!!! Should I put my phone in rice? If so for how long? SOMEONE HELP PLEASE...it‚Äôs an iPhone 5s
Hey MKBHD<br>This is the best phone I will buy it &amp; awesome video üëçüëåüòç. But can you tell me the name of the wallpaper so can apply it
Link for this wallpaper?
Double standards .if a company use lcd screen then they will tell u its old school stuff it should be oled and when a company use oled they say its not good as lcd . Wtf
Face unlock feature is also there on oneplus 2 its not something new
Hey Guys I need some subscribers plz subscribe to my channel
‚úåÔ∏è
@Marques will you do full review?
Rip apple x
16 Megabixel. That was pretty funny.
Full review? Is the camera better? and face unlock?
When the review will come out..
Utter bloatware
LGV30 or OPT5? üò© Is it worth saving some money. I was pretty much set on the v30
One plus 5 best or 5t is beat
Oneplus 3/3T just got ota Oreo update. <br><br>Oneplus is actually supporting their phones this time around.
Android has had face unlock since 2012. All stock android has had this feature unless specifically disabled by the manufacturer. It&#39;s called trusted face on the latest android releases, but all the way back to Android jellybean, it was still there. it was called face unlock. Find it under smart lock.
&quot;...But this... this, now we&#39;re talkin&quot; üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Is it now compatible with Verizon?
oneplus is a dick
Oneplus 5T or LG V30 ??
FUCK THE SHITTY iPHONE X!! THE FLAGSHIP KILLER IS HERE!!!
Do HTC U11+ review
Camt decidw between this, the pixel 2 or the s8
Hey Marques. Do they ever sell a silver or white model. This is incredibly compelling, but I&#39;ve always preferred a light color since my first smartphone back in 2009
Hi Marq,<br><br>I have a suggestion why don&#39;t you start vertical videos ? I mean like posting your reviews with vertical videos ... ! I think it would be a great idea üí°Cause most of the time we spent on phones and I watch most of your reviews on my iPhone while traveling I think it would be awesome if you try a vertical reviewing video ... Just give it a try !
ZenFone 4 pro review please
Can you check if it supports USB-C to HDMI or any MHL adapter?
Really considering getting this phone but I&#39;m just not sold yet. Having a dilemma between this phone and Google Pixel XL.
so is this video sponsored by OnePlus? the camera upgrade seems somewhat ambiguous. I assume there is no OIS?
Shit phone then.
Good phone ))
Great review as always!!
Is the LED notification light brighter than the oneplus5 that was patheticicaly low brightness.
what brand is your jacket from? It&#39;s sickkk
Hey there, i just confused, is it having the FACE ID FEATURE while in ur trolling video, u didnt shown whether it unlocked by face id or backside sensor
Full review plz
It looks like an LG G2 son!! Totally getting this
We see that knot on ya had. Put some tea tree oil on that shit. Lmao
Where can i find that wallpaper?
The second camera is probably just downsampling the image to reduce noise and sharpen the image.
Hello buddy i just subscribed your channel about a week or month ago and really really appreciate bro iI really really like you videos
Does the Face ID work with glasses??
Herschel schould pay you for that backpack placement in your videos. I bought that grey backpack cause i loved it in your videos xD
PMSL at the cunts who bought the OP5 thinking they were getting the latest greatest out there from OP. Don&#39;t get me wrong I like  OP they touched my fucking geeky soul, but, but, but I&#39;m above and everything else someone who loves tech not brand. At some point I felt their philosophy was in line to mine, but as they gained popularity they started to do their things and while they are still shipping great phones I think they are playing a bit with the community. They did it with the OP3, they are doing it again with the OP5. Don&#39;t tell me they couldn&#39;t bear the little flaws with the OP5 and had to get out the OP5T a couple of months down the line. Anyways I&#39;m on my RN3 and will prolly look for a new phone next year and I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t be a OP phone.
It seems like one plus just kill that apple face id,
what happened to one+ being &quot;cheap&quot;? Oppo owns oneplus so they can&#39;t complain their issues being about that they&#39;re small. This hype needs to die.
I have a OP 3T, and that also has facial recognition. It&#39;s also insanely fast so, i&#39;m not sure what all the hype is about.
The dream smartphone (2017) Video is highly required Marques
1080p? :/
I just wish they supported CDMA bands (verizon,sprint)
1+5 Trillion
Hey Marques, quick question. How good is the performance of the OnePlus 5T? If I download a lot of things and spend a lot of hours on it, how bad is the lag??<br>I am a gamer, I also love music, sports and YouTube, so I do a lot on my phone, so I need the performance to go along with it.
OnePlus is becoming more and more expensive and yet they throw a &quot;it&#39;s going to cost 700$&quot; before they announce their phones and they get away with the price bumps. These are not &quot;affordable&quot; phones anymore.
Pixel 2 vs one plus 5t?üòû  <br>Which 1 to buy?
&quot;Merging four pixels into one&quot; sounds like pixel binning.
Verizon yet?
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
@mkbhd bro r u okay? You look sad
Auto tune at the end ??
Best budget Flagship Smartphone in 2017
&quot;Holds up to minor splashing&quot;. There are videos of it straight up being entirely submerged for 5+ minutes, Shot across the garden floor with a hose etc. They didn&#39;t pay for the IP certification, but the OP5 models are fine vs water.
Why do people bitch about the screen blue-ing or rainbow-ing at extreme angles? You never have the screen at that angle anyway. Nitpicking, whiny bastards.
Please inform one plus 5T having WiFi charging? It&#39;s support wireless charging
RIP Face ID
Can i get that wallpaper link?
Still waiting for the full review
Extra large, extra swanky.
I really like the video..but I have question..it&#39;s difficult to me to carry a 6&quot; phone ...what would I do ? I go for OnePlus 5 vs 5t plz tell me...plz.plz..plz..tell me anyone
still looks like iphone 7 plus -_-
Plz make antutu benchmark video
The s8 has facial recognition
ÂèØ‰ª•ÔºåËøôÂæàOPPO Ôº≤11s
I wonder if someone would pay me $500 for my S7 Edge... I wanna finally have a OnePlus. This is the one
Does face recognition work on Darkness
This is a company from my home!!!!!
MKBHD got &quot;weird&quot; syndrome.. lol
Let me tell you one thing,,,<br>Our per capita income is 1650$<br>Is it possible for us to grab a iphone X or Note 8?<br>But,,,,Oneplus 5 or 5T can be considered.... though it is quite hard....
I hope you do giveaway with that
Am I the only person who wants a nice phone with a 5&quot; screen? Doesn&#39;t matter how good the s:b ratio is, it&#39;s still a huge screen
Just buy an s8. Best phone out there!
Can u share the link for that wallpaper?
Right now i am using s7 edge .. the best thing about it is the display clarity and the sharpness .  Which mobile will suite me .. 1+5t or note8 or razor phone .
Is 5t waterproof secretly?
Looks like a decent phone. Nice alternative for those not interested in either Apple or Samsung&#39;s $1,000 phones.
I&#39;d rather battery life and 1080p over a quad HD screen and less battery. I tend to look at my phone straight on, so the rainbow effect wouldn&#39;t matter to me.
Does this phone work with At&amp;t?
Why many Indian comment hereüòÖüòÖüòÖ
This is the one.
Wild headphone jack appears... :D
So yes, this proves touch ID and face ID can be in a single device!<br>Btw marques , u totally rocked  (as usual)
where does Marques get his wallpapers from... they look very nice.
Hey marques which is better the razor or this oneplus 5t stuck between both, thankyou.
Why are there no 5T speed tests on Youtube?  Is there an embargo on speed testing the 5t for early reviewers?
What did the librarian say<br><br><br><br>Read More
I think Marques will be sad when this year ends. He loves saying &quot;2017&quot;. :-)
Such a good and awesome 2017 phone to date, for the price point 499 ? I won&#39;t think to get same price here.... Maybe
definitely copping myself one of these
Why a faded tone for this video marques? Normal color tone was catchy and was so soothing to watch.
Is it just me or does this video feel like it has an Instagram filter over it? Coloring seems off. (Still crispy af)
I&#39;ll keep my $150 unlocked essential phone! If they stay in business, I&#39;ll keep receiving updates for years, not A year.
Do they still have the information sending out portion built in?
The 3t also does the rainbow thing
God damnit can I exchange my 5 for this
So a friend takes your phone, usually it&#39;s locked with a code or fingerprint <br><br>Now they can just point the phone towards your face and they are in
The logo and fingerprint scanner have to be switched or both lowered a bit, It is just a tiny little bit too high for people with small hands
OnePlus 5T or Note 8?
The &quot;intelligent technology&quot; sounds like pixel binning, basically to increase the signal to noise ratio.<br><br>It&#39;s already used in dslrs. But having two sensors to gather more data and then downsample it should provide cleaner photos.
OnePlus for life
what a phone! wish I could have this one plus 5T
Finally my wife has said she is finished with the iPhone (too many issues and battery problems and things just not working). I thought about getting her this 5t to get a good taste of Android and hopefully things will work.
so far only for 8 GB ram
It&#39;s completely ridiculous that they still don&#39;t have OIS on the cameras. They say they focused on low light with this one, yet no OIS. What? That&#39;s literally the only thing about this phone that I don&#39;t think is perfect.<br><br>Btw having two cameras at the same focal distance allows you to merge the two to make a much superior picture in theory. That four pixel merging they are talking about sounds the same as what the Olympic camera does to create 42mp images with a lower resolution sensor.
Why buy iPhone X when you can buy two 1+ 5T for you and your love one
It looks well thin that like
Awesome
What would be the best phone under 300
this dang phone has more ram than most laptops what the
What u think which is the best bezel less phone till now now i think u shoul make video on best bezel less phone...
It&#39;s not just as secure as face id or finger print sensor
Nice video bro
AMAZING PHONE AND AMAZING PRICE THANKS ONEPLUS
Ah screen why is like dat ahh!?
I really hate this brand, it sucks! I rather than to buy Samsung.
Waterproof ?
Wait, 6k comments already?<br>I thought I was early.
Achha He
No OIS???
Imagine buying the one plus 5 the day before this came out RIP
Any change in your Camera ?
i think the rainbow effect is from the oleophobic coating on the screen my alcatel idol4S has the same effect. Or maybe its just RGB we dont know
I love OnePlus phones. I&#39;m still using my 3 and boy this thing has never failed me. Its snappy and oxygen is so simple and efficient. I will never buy anything else as long as OnePlus makes phones. I don&#39;t really need all the gimmicks Samsung and apple have to offer all I need is a fast phone with fast charging. However I&#39;m a little bit disappointed with the screen this time just cuz it&#39;s a bit bigger but the resolution is the same. I guess I won&#39;t be able to tell the difference anyways.
Still wish it worked on Verizon!
Where do you download your mobile wallpapers from?
smartisan nut pro 2
Still no full CDMA capability
Having a 1080p screen in the name of performance is not an excuse... other phones that have a qHD screen have a setting for dropping resolution. One Plus is not what we expected!!!
I still don&#39;t understand why they won&#39;t add OIS
Not like how they put the fingerprint button on the back thats a buzz kill for me and i would prefer the head phone jack to ne at the top not the bottom
Well shit, why does that rainbow shit even matter? What fucktard views their phones from that angle? I view mine straight on.
Watch on OP3. One plus3 Camera clarity has been deliberately reduced in the latest Android update.
&quot;...Thank you for watching. Talk to you later. Peace.&quot;... Something about that Phrase was weirdly unsatisfying...
How are it&#39;s speakers??
I loved my Oneplus One but all following Phones are missing a USP.
Surprised to see the 1+ hate accounts have not managed to steal the top comments on this review yet.
The quality of your videos is so damn goood!
soso
They release the oneplus at the wrong time of the year every time. For example, oneplus 5 should have released in March and this oneplus 5t should have released in September and they should be doing that every year rather than selling it more close to the predecessor. It should have an equal time gap. For the oneplus fans there&#39;s no point buying the oneplus 6 when it comes out because the 6t will be out sooner. Great phone overall, much improved camera and the face recognition is way better than IPhone&#39;s Face and touch ID. This is what the phone after oneplus 3t should have been. But they should have improved the battery to at least 3500mah but it&#39;ll still last you the full day with probably 20% to spare like my LG V30 always does
May I know the name of the wallpaper app? :D
Which is better please, OnePlus 5t or Infinix05? Thanks!
Would be great if you could post these same phone review videos on FB, BUT...add some photos in the comments (or post) from the phones camera you‚Äôre reviewing so we can really see how the photos look and compare to othersüò¨. How pics look when you post are important to a lot of people. That‚Äôd be super helpfulüôåüèª
Its the ONE
Wallpaper link
Fact does anyone know <br>What is reason behind T <br>Its because of apple S series <br>Logic if we add 1 to S it becomes T<br>Means OnePlus surpassed apple
Please make a video on oneplus 5t cases. Need to know if default TPU case is good enough or any extra case need to be purchased
Marques try Smartisan jianguo pro2, best designed Android phone in 2017.
At least a few shots with the camera would have been cool
Headphone jack? Alright, I&#39;m sold. It already sounded pretty good, but if I&#39;m gonna put my money where my mouth is...
What&#39;s da name of da wallpaper?
I buyed oneplus 5 3 months back.. Now they released oneplus 5t... :&#39;( :&#39;( Can you give away 5t to me please... I really want it... :&#39;(
where&#39;s the ip68 feature?

#34 on trending üî•üî•üî• in Indiaüò≤üòé
so u got time to test the faceID but cant take ONE nightshot and say if it&#39;s good or not? :(
when an S8, 7+ and the V30 had a child..
OnePlus has been having face detection to unlock phone, for quiet sometime, I have it on my one plus 3 , under smart locks. <br>It unlocks the phone, but doesn&#39;t take u right to the main screen. ;)
Great video as always... It&#39;s a real treat to watch you talk about the stuff... üëçüëçüëç.. Can you please put the link for the wallpaper you are using on the phone in the video.. Thanks a ton..

This one makes the one plus 5 looks like a moto g5 plus lolll
Where did you get that wallpaper?
Where can I get the wallpaper?<br>It looks dope.
Looks similar to Nexus 6
Your video was quite dark buddy. Looks really grey next to the white background of YouTube
Waiting for the giveaway. Hope you do this üòä
Please do a OnePlus 5T giveaway.
Please do a giveaway..!
That&#39;s what I am talking about. Half price for a phone with flagship specs. God bless oneplus. I am so glad I did not buy these overprice phones from Apple or Samsung.
I want this phone soooo badly! This DESTROYS iPhone x!!
Unlike those $1000 flagships, this is something I can actually afford, so pls do a full review of this soon, so I can watch it before actually finally buying this.
How to find this wallpaper?
Hmm, i&#39;m confused you mention that it&#39;s not an OLED display. But several other sites are reporting it as an OLED display...??
I don&#39;t know why whether it&#39;s my screen or is there something off about the grading on this video.

Apple: We installed the fastest Face ID which uses dot projector to scan your face. Face ID is the future of smartphones.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Oneplus: Yeah bitch! But we are the fastest and also kept the fingerprint scanner.
Loved it üòçüòç <br>one plus 5t rocks
What the fuck is your name and who are you?
1440p squad üëä
How about the jelly scrolling issue of the oneplus 5, is it also there on the oneplus 5T?
no thanks
well done
oneplus rocks!
that face unlock is fast. its basically saying, dont fall asleep when you&#39;re with your girl, SHE can unlock it instantly and ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOSE!!!
Why does the Indian version of oneplus 5/5T have a huge box charger as compared to foreign versions??<br>Its strange, why only here.
Liking it it so far! Off subject it would be hella sweet if you got the Tesla Roadster BRO!! üòé
It&#39;s a amazing phone <br>And it&#39;s my favorite phone because it was cheaper than Samsung Note 8 and IPhone X.......<br>I would say 5t is best.....
looks like a counterfeit iphone 7 plus
very 2017!
How much is it?
Note8 is extremely fast for face recognition. But no need to compare to iPhone. IPhone is 3 yrs behind
This looks more like 2013 LG G2 than &quot;2017&quot;.
1440p on iPhone 7 Plus
you keep the saying &quot;industrial&quot; design. As if you know what that means. Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured. The word you are looking for when describing the phone&#39;s visual design is Contemporary. <br><br>&quot;Contemporary style encompasses a range of styles developed in the latter half of the 20th century. Pieces feature softened and rounded lines as opposed to the stark lines seen in modern design. contain neutral elements and bold color, and they focus on the basics of line, shape, and form.&quot; - google.
Glad to see they refreshed the design a bit. Face ID is a cool feature if it works better than Apple&#39;s implementation. A few months ago, I got a G6 while a friend of mine got an OP5. We both spend exactly $500. His has a slightly faster processor and a few more MP on the camera, but I have a Quad HD screen, Wireless charging, wide angle camera, expandable memory, and IP67 water proof, all in a glass-backed design even more modern than this OP5T. But, the V30, S8, and Note 8 trump all of these phones anyway.
nice features but too big. my 3t is also a big phone and still uncomfortable holding it.
Hey I&#39;ve got a OnePlus 5, and this has facial recognition too! I haven&#39;t used it yet, but it&#39;s a feature that&#39;s always been there, not new to the 5T. Also isn&#39;t the facial recognition 2D? That might explain how it&#39;s so quick
u r finally color grading ur video
The camera tech is basically what asus and nokia have done in the past. They simply get the data from 4 individual megapixels and combine them to get more data from the light captured on the sensor.
Do you think OnePlus 5 will have face recognition? Like anytime soon?
hi
1080 makes this DOA.
Oneplus 5t = the iPhone X, but half the price and the features apple took off they put back on
I think you don&#39;t like honor devices<br>Why is it so bro
Is this phone really has a hackwear in it?
This dude&#39;s review is way better than CNET
Why no way to replace that damn virtual buttonÔºü
Algum üáßüá∑???
So  they&#39;re following the industry silly practices... 2:1 ratio, removal of front buttons, along with the fingerprint scanner, overly high resolution, face recognition... I guess if I update my 1+3, it&#39;ll be to 1+5-no-T at most.
Am I the only one thinking of going for the OP5 once the T comes out? The OP5&#39;s price will definitely drop. I own an S7 Edge, I was wondering if it&#39;ll be a worth switch from this to OP5. Comments? Thank you!
I have a Oneplus 5 and I love it
Do the HTC u11 life
<b>ahem</b> still no stereo speakers<br><br>but still my fav phone
would have bought this but they don&#39;t make a cdma version of it. doesn&#39;t work for Verizon network.
