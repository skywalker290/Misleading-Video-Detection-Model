god damn I love my WRX

The greatest 6 minutes in the history of movie car chases, no question. Wright couldn&#39;t have gotten the scene any better in his wildest dreams.

Man I just wish people would realize Edgar Wright makes awesome movies when they are released, seems<br>Like people find his movies after they have come<br>Out
Dumbest Movie

I love how they understand how Baby sincronize everything with music
When you reach that right level of stoned when playing GTA
all that work just to put fingertips on the doors as they exit to the new car. SMH

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=155">2:35</a> i love this
if you pay attention, everything is synced, from the camera switches, to the trunk opening, and even down to police sirens its a very well orchestrated movie

Drive did it better.

the way jon bernthal looks at him when he goes in reverse lmfao
Hugely overrated movie. Driver was better

Great driving scene.  I heard they won an award in this scene for the WORST background music in 2017, it was a Razzie award I believe (if not, they should have).  Dorky song.
all that racing going flat out to the limits then pulling into the car park and switching the engine of lol thats the turbo knackered lol
my when I play Mario kart
I was on an airplane and clicked on the new spiderman movie. I only realised about 4 minutes in that this was not spiderman lol.
Was he slow? No
honestly, what&#39;s more impressive is that Baby did it in a subaru...<br><br>without it breaking down
Red...... inconspicuous.....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=190">3:10</a> my grandma drives faster than that.
I&#39;ve got this on blu ray one of my favourite movies the soundtrack is brilliant
my only issue with this scene is that when he floors the throttle at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=152">2:32</a> the engine just does another tiny rev and doesn&#39;t immediately start bouncing off the limiter
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=171">2:51</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=200">3:20</a><br>My favorite part of the chase. That part is just PERFECTION
Baby is just a baby compared to the guy who DRIVES.
Driver don&#39;t use glove, and they don&#39;t burn the Subaru... Cops have just to take fingerprints of everyone...<br>How the producer can miss this !
Damn the driver‚Äôs lips are beauitful!
Great music, great action, great editing. But had he just driven away normally and calm, no police would have gone after them because police hadn&#39;t responded to the robbery yet. But then we would not have an action film.
Great driving scene and an incredible soundtrack.
CGI car stunts are a turn off for car enthusiast. I prefer &#39;The Driver&#39;.
If you told me Edgar Wright made AMVs or frag highlight vids in his spare time, I&#39;d believe you. The way the music syncs to the smallest things just reminds me of the most well done ones.
Nah when you can see the road in his glasses that was so dope
NFS :  Most Wanted
I love the fact that he checked out the drivers in red cars around him and chose the one that would act just as planned
It kind of hits different Kevin Spacey saying, &quot;That&#39;s my baby.&quot;
The editing in this scene is INSANE.
belbotooooommssss

one of my favoirte movies <br>and one of my favorite scenes

Fun fact: no seatbelts were harmed during the filming of this scene

Is he acoustic?

Heh, he waited until the other three were in the bank before geeking out.

BEAUTIFUL!! One of the best movie scenes I&#39;ve ever seen
baby driver is such a underrated movie
Worst getaway driver ever - just made it obvious to the passing cop they&#39;re the suspects! And left all the forensic evidence in the car.... and it&#39;s bright red... I&#39;m getting the idea of this film now.
most impossible car chase ever lol
Ok so is this whole movie just entirely based on the Mint Royale Blue Song? Cause if so they cast the wrong driver. Even the damn windshield wiper thing
Mint Royale - Blue Song
Movie name?
I forgot just how good this was.

Rewatching this movie and appreciating the amount of effort put into it such as the driving aspect, the music syncing the music to the beats of everything else and the storyline is outstanding. Wish they made a second one.
I hate this scene so much. All of the cool stuff he does to get out of situations is just edited out &quot;ohhhhh! watch out he&#39;s about to -&quot; quick cut and he keeps driving
can&#39;t imagine how many gaskets that Subaru blew up for this scene

Sigh, of course they should have shut the doors.  Just sigh.  So close to perfect.
I like how they just leave all the doors open on the Subaru.
was he slow?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=188">3:08</a> yea .. I take back everything I said bout you..
Statham has done better in Transporter.
Did the chase scene make any sense, or felt even slightly realistic?---- Hell NO!<br><br>Did it make the movie fun, and got people exited! YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!
Spacey&#39;s character was a horrible creep but now that line at the end sounds extra rough.
Excellent choice of getaway car; a 300HP &amp; 300 Lb-Ft torque symmetrical AWD 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX STi that anyone can actually buy for about $15K in good shape and can reach 60 mph in 5 seconds!
Perfection.
this made me want a wrx
Good lord, how many fingerprints and DNA do you want to leave on the car?
i love Subaru
no gloves, car abandoned. Fingerprints everywhere
Greatest opening sequence in cinematic history
The best Subaru commercial.
Movie good‚ù§
This is stoopid. Why would anyone keep his earbuds in the whole time?
Wow that‚Äôs stupid
This is the second best opening scene of all time. Second only to The Dark Knight and Beating out Cars in third.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=91">1:31</a> I haven&#39;t watched Baby Driver before, but will this moment come into play later in the movie?
Overrated, with bad cinematography. Can&#39;t compare to the 70s or 80s.
being in the theater watching this the first time was so surreal. he  acts so calm with the music until it popped off. and was at the edge the entire scene
Vin diesel should be taking notes
Im not even nearly this good in gta
So the moment each robber lost their cool was when the glasses came off.
The best photography and stunt work (and editing) i&#39;ve seen in a car sequence... ever
Groovy.
My next urber ride
That engine and turbo sound... RB26DETT... WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THAT?!
Baby kadhaaaa
Who is better?<br>Frank Martin (Transporter) or Baby (Baby Driver)?
This scene is dumb af

they let the woman drive at the end? bad choice. jk
The helicopter pilot was stupid because all he had to do was follow the car with the vents on the hood the other cars didn‚Äôt have them

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=241">4:01</a> The phalanx of cop cars is when I laughed and checked out of the movie as anything but an extended music video.
‚ÄúHear-no-evil‚Äôs back, huh?‚Äù
... yes
As far as I&#39;m concerned, this scene is the perfect music video for Bellbottoms.
I often find car chases boring in movies but man I love this scene.
GGGGGGG
Hard to believe but even my wife liked this movie.
How many sets of tires did they go through in filming that scene?
&quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot; by Kavinsky syncs up to this scene almost effortlessly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=321">5:21</a> puts his fingerprints all over the door. Ever heard of gloves?

Kevin Spacey pedo rapist
Y do I want the criminals to escape with the money they just robbed üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Crazy how I catch something new every single time I watch this opening scene, without fail. This time it was that the trees and the wall rushing by at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=184">3:04</a> are somehow timed perfectly with the drums.
The most unbelievable part of this whole movie is the way the cops have any pursuit skills or planning whatsoever and their Crown Vics can even hope to keep up in traffic with a tuned WRX driven by someone with actual skill.
Woulda been cooler if it was an evo
I d like to see a movie where baby driver races against the transporter.
The silver Chevy Impala at the beginning is a nod to the movie Drive which also used a silver Chevy Impala in the begining.
need to give it to the stunt driver...
I have a sneaking suspicion that he&#39;s driving a automatic.
There were literally no cops when they left the bank. If they kept cool they might have reached the garage unoticed

2017 was a good year
Mediocre movie, but this scene is white hot fire. Without a doubt one of the greatest getaway scenes ever to exist, past, present, and future.
It seems they left a lot of fingerprints on that car they dumped.

BELLBOOOOTTOMS
High point of the film - unfortunately.
im confused that baby isnt wearing gloves to keep his fingerprints off the wheel
One of my favorite things about this scene is how many changes they had to make to the WRX. The real car has too much grip to drive like that.
this is the longest any subaru drove without braking down
Yoo it&#39;s a subaru
Probably good film for those who have missed &quot;Taxi&quot; with Sami Nasiri .
This movie sucked
Spacey saying thats my baby, certainly has a different tone to it now.
Even though there were doing crazy things with Subaru, they still ended up with Toyota
One of the best openings to any movie ever.  PERFECT music choice.
I think this is my favorite movie
Whenever I rob banks I always use a bright red Subaru wrx‚Ä¶.
Hello we&#39;ll race, also I lost my headphones. <br>I don&#39;t like pods
Wow, he is so cool when he&#39;s dancing in the car. Look at him go!
Do a little dance, make a little love. Get down tonight!

Quick question though...why is it that every single time he evades the police there&#39;s another car just...perfectly placed to follow him anyway? The cops may be good, but this one was just farcical with how well-timed the &quot;just arriving on scene&quot; cops were time after time after time. Even just once would have been weird, but it just. keeps. happening.<br><br>I call bullshit.

I don&#39;t know why, but I still prefer the remix with Sean Paul&#39;s &quot;Temperature&quot;... for some reason, that song made it even more badass. And I&#39;m a metal head/rocker.

I&#39;d say this is the fourth best car chase scene form a movie.<br>1. Drive (2011)<br>2. Ronin (1998)<br>3. Bullitt (1968)<br>4. Baby Driver (2017)

This Scene is great, but the rest of the flim is mediocre. They should have focused more on the driving and chase sequences, instead of creating a cheesy romance plot.
Mind-blowing driving menüî•üî•üî•

AND, they just LEFT IT OPEN? Couldn&#39;t they have thrown a pink jacket and a random textbook inside it, and closed the door?   Maybe make sure said car was beside a bunch of other cars?
this should be a subaru commercial lol
never bring a Ford Crown Victoria to a rally!!!
whats the music?
Love the driving, but I hate driver is not wearing gloves, and leaves his fingerprints everywhere, including the bottle he throws into the back, and drumming on the outside door.  Then they don&#39;t park the car, but leave it in the middle of the parking lot with the doors open.  Seems like a lot to hope a care thief will find it before the cops.  Just leave it parked, unlocked with the keys in it and it will likely be stolen, or it will be days until the cops find it.  My willing suspension of disbelief is overstretched.  Jonathon Banks would never make such mistakes.

All the comments here are nice and I totally subscribe to them but could we please just take a moment to appreciate the sheer brilliance of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion&#39;s BELLBOTTOMS track, without which I am convinced this scene wouldn&#39;t have come to existence at all (for I believe the scene was built around the soundtrack and not otherwise)

that&#39;s some slick drifting from an AWD vehicle.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=295">4:55</a> one of my favorite things about this scene is Buddy patting him on the back in support and grinning ear to ear. An oddly wholesome moment in an otherwise action packed scene.
I just realized he&#39;s dressed like Han Solo. &quot;I know a few maneuvers. We&#39;ll lose &#39;em.&quot;

This movie - at least this scene - reminds me of the movie &quot;The Driver&quot; starring Ryan O&#39;Neal and Bruce Dern.  O&#39;Neal plays the professional getaway driver and the driving he does in the movie parallels this driving. Right down to the expression on the driver&#39;s face.
Everything about this scene is amazing. The acting, the stunt driving, visuals, sound effects being synced with the music

Edgar Wright uses music in his movies better than any other filmmaker, the only other guy who comes close to Wright&#39;s ballpark is Tarantino.

This scene introduced me to Jon Spencer and he blew my mind.

This scene did more for car chases than the entire Fast and Furious franchise.

That cocky finger point forward from Jon Bernthal is such a vibe. Every viewer now knows they&#39;re about to see the opposite of what they expect for the next 2 hours.
I&#39;m sold. Gonna watch this movie!
I totally did not expect to like this movie (I was dragged to the theater by my kids), but it was much better than I anticipated.
Interviewed Jon Spencer once, he told me the song inspired Wright to make the film.

I don&#39;t know if Edgar Wright intended this pun or not but...<br><br>A Three CAR Monty!
They&#39;ll be in big trouble if they get caught, none of them are wearing seat belts!
What movie is it
4 door saloon with rally performance gotta love subarus
Good driving scenes. Bad movie.
I&#39;ve seen this intro with deja Vu added to it and it&#39;s so much better that the song actually playing makes the scene worse to me
Enjoyed this scene a lot. I prefer the opening of drive because was more tense and realistic whereas this is more slick and entertaining
Even though it is a movie but he is crazy, intelligence  and perfect
What every GTA Heist feels like in our heads
Only God knows how many times I‚Äôve rewatch this master piece of movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=205">3:25</a> literally the only reason I wanted to see the movie.
I thought the driver would be a baby in Baby Driver‚Ä¶But sure a person ho is driving like an insane maniac outrunning the cops cause they robbed a bank works out too.
Jesus Christ Loves You All‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚úùÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Rob a bank in broad daylight with virtually no disguise. Then let your getaway driver leave prints all over the car. That&#39;s a brilliant plan, ese!
Great movie...miss seeing kevin spacey in roles.
The kids a bit of a flog tbh.ü§°
Down town Atlanta!!
I am just now realizing that the reason Baby goes backwards instead was because he noticed the cop car going by so he knew that would most likely be the closest cop car to head to the scene so he improvised to avoid it
This film really is severely underrated. A pity because the director insisted on practical FX for all of the chase/crash sequences. Even the car falling out of the parking garage at the end was not CGI or miniature work. They literally dropped a REAL car.
jon spencer blues explosion !
I hate that they leave the doors open. They did everything perfect but such a small detail would draw attention to the car and they‚Äôd be pulling dna off it asap cuz it would make them think it was the right Subaru.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my baby.‚Äù
I can&#39;t watch this without the Spitfire ost played over stuck in my head
I&#39;ve always loved the &quot;well played, kid&quot; shoulder touch Jon Hamm gives Baby.
The dumbest decision to take a red car.
One of the best Subaru ads ever done lol.... Too bad they are not focused on that segment anymore.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=162">2:42</a> was the car interior roof burned or what ?
he would fasho cause attention to himself lmao
Let go Hillsong Y&amp;F?
but... the wrx is fwd
Decided to finally check this movie out and I immediately had to come back to this scene after finishing it, it&#39;s just so great!
what a bimbominchia movie...

This Da Real Baby Right Here Mne &amp; He Know Wtf He Doing Behind Da Wheel ‚ù§ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Favourite opening scene to any movie
Y&#39;know, the more I watch this film, and this opening scene... the only reason the dude in the front is so mad is because he points forward... Baby then drives backwards.<br><br>Homie ruins a reaaaal good thing
As a kid I never knew this was lowkey a Subaru adüòÇ
What a beautiful openning
The only thing that really really bugs me about this scene is that nobody in tbe car is wearing their seatbelts! One quick stop and these guys could easily bump thei face against the seat and BOOM, one nosebleed and that car is tracked to you immediately
so this is a really bad stupid remake of DRIVER 2011 which was a bad-remake of THE DRIVER from 1978 basically
unfortunatly this is the first and unique good scene in that movie.
bro driving a car in that speed and the maneuvering would make my stomach on easy. Wallahi I&#39;m finished üòÇ
I am a huge Edgar Wright fan, but I cannot sit through this film.  It just tries way too hard to be cool, and it simply isn&#39;t.
As an ATL-ien, it&#39;s also fantastic because it&#39;s basically correct. You can pretty much do exactly this on exactly those streets. Those are the legit one-ways and weird turns. Much respect.
Late?
Finger prints left in the Subaru ?
Now that is the need for speed!
Fun fact he bought the car
Wow goddamn

&quot;go forward&quot; baby driver: nah finna do it tokyo drift style
This movie was so bad.    Really bad.
that&#39;s how i used to play nfs most wanted 2005 ü§ò
greatness of the scene is that it sets up like he&#39;s an odd kid with special needs and then turns out he&#39;s an awesome driver
This was the best driving he did in the entire movie.
Pfft.  A man never leaves his ride.<br><br>But it was a cool chase scene.  Guess I&#39;ll have to rent it and check it out.

The best driving scene ever!!!

No GD green screen. Jesus I hate cgi so much now a days. Par for the course for how bad most movies are now. Even the writers on most movies phone it in.
GREAT FLICK!
This guy must love music so much.

I don&#39;t know why, but I find the flip-a-switch change from stoic to singing his heart out so adorable.
This guy was playing grand theft auto in real life lol
Me from India, went to this movie without any expectations, there were only 10+ guys there. Man, I gotto tell you all, I just enjoyed the movie... one of the best ever I saw..
one of the best movies ever made!
A lot of fingerprints ...
Is there anything better than driving alone.
Mujer la concha tu madre
What a stupid movie.  The writers are a joke.
Stain in my pants
What a load of crap.  And, as usual, they disable the thumbs down tracker.
This movie was, and still is, a total riot from start to finish. My only complaint is that more time should&#39;ve been given to develop the love story so Debora&#39;s decisions in the finale wouldn&#39;t seem so stupid, but that&#39;s such a small problem in very well-made movie. This scene alone makes this movie an instant classic! The stunt-work, cinematography, and soundtrack/editing are superb! I&#39;m still in shock that my in-laws didn&#39;t care for it - makes me question who I married.
gta irl
Is this guy even old enough to drive?
His fingerprints are all over that car you know.
2.5 I. Add music lead foot ..engage
Bare hands, touching the Subaru all over, leaving all SORTS of prints on it, and then leaving the doors open as they leave, making it significantly more suspicious for anyone who finds it.<br>Great plan, that.
Not a great film ,,,,,but brilliant  sound track including  some great northern soul üëç üëå
Wow..and I thought I was the best that ever was.
is this the inoffical Driver 2 `? i thought i read something about that..

A ridiculous movie and the performance of all the actors was a shameful performance and the actor Jimmy Foxx fell in this movie a big fall and reduced his stardom and fame because he acted in this ridiculous movie
these police spawn in like need for speed.
This scene is still better then very fast and furious movie made combined
I thought this chase was soundtracked ‚ÄúBrighton Rock‚Äù.<br>Couldn‚Äôt they get the rights for this clip?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=318">5:18</a> nobody is inside the car.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs">0:00</a> you can hear a ringing sound, which is what Baby would listen to all the time, and then it transitioned into the sound of the string in the Bellbottoms song intro. just genius!
I watch this to start my day. Gets me pump
Again<br>Again üòÅ
that&#39;s how you drive. from the very start. they told him to go forward, and he goes backwards because he knows it would be unexpected and give him a few extra seconds to show the middle finger to the cops.<br><br>this guy knows how to drive fast but that&#39;s not his best quality. he&#39;s aware of his surroundings and the psychology of those that pursue him. he used the music as a way to relax and justify why it was there doing nothing inside the car. we can also see that the rest isn&#39;t aware of this since we see a change in his behavior as soon as he&#39;s alone and goes back to a more serious attitude when they leave the bank.<br><br>the trick with the other two red cards is great but, what I like about it is that it shows those two cards were there by simple chance, he saw them, improvised and forced one of them to swap places so the cops would follow the wrong car.<br><br>masterfully.<br><br><br>it&#39;s not the best pursuit scenes I have ever seen but the very best doesn&#39;t count since it&#39;s part of an anime. this is the second best pursuit.
DAMN i wanna see this movie now, considering the fact that i took my first driving lesson about a week ago and automatically noticed he was wearing headphones which is illegal, i was instantly intrigued just by how he danced along with his car through the music he played, which was also so amazing woooo
tmm<br>ist geil
I like to think that the other actors in the car weren&#39;t told what he was going to do
Nice music
These 6 minutes are better then the whole Fast and Furious franchise.
Kevin Spacey screws up this movie.
How many times I ‚ù§ watching this trailer
I&#39;m honestly sick of channels like yours taking a perfectly fine 21:9 file and rendering it out to 16:9 degrading the quality of it before YouTube gets a chance to degrade it further.<br>You don&#39;t need to change the aspect ratio! Just post a clip in it&#39;s native aspect ratio!
Scene is awesome, although, my mind always circles back to fingerprints left on the abandoned supra, lol
Was he slow?
No camera shakes. Just a clear view of chase scene. Perfect
sucks knowing now that Ansel was accused of sexual harrassment cuz i really liked him but its always the ones u least expect, what a shame
This is then east opening scene of any movie. Fight me.

any movie that makes a car chase interesting is a win
Transporter had better chase scenes.
and all without gloves, they didn&#39;t even burn the old car))
This scene made me get a WRX and even though its regularly needing repairs I still wouldnt swap it for the world
Why is he parking on the other side of the road in front of the bank?
OMG Duc Phuc , i like your cover version. Love it !
The scene will never not be awesome.  The version with Deja Vu overlaid on it though is also hilariously accurate.
Is no one gonna mention they all 4 left their fingerprints on the door handles
good video.
Makes me miss midnight Club 3: DUB edition.
Oh... that&#39;s why The Punisher didnt show up in &quot; The Defenders &quot;
I never understood this movie.  He never drives a baby, and he&#39;s not a baby.  So, I don&#39;t get it.
He playing GTA in real life ü§£
Too much fantasy in the pursuit, specially with the whole red cars but still was very Good
NOPE. They need to re-make this with a diverse cast, crew and director.
This is the best film I have ever watched. Also Subaru Impreza WRX STI 2004 is my dream Car :)
The driver, Drive and Baby driver, a holy thrinity of the movies
I really enjoyed this movie,  but what really stands out to me is this scene was in my city of Atlanta!
2 other red Subarus arriving just in time to fool the helicopter crew.  What are the chances of that happening.  It&#39;s a stylishly daft film but I enjoyed it.
Bebe
Lol
Movie producers: ‚ÄúOk, how much does a car company want to pay to sponsor this opening scene?‚Äù<br>Subaru: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
gazimba blorp, zutoozi! gargalure!
This is good, but that video where they edited Gas Gas Gas to this scene was golden<br><br>Also I hope they add this particular scene as a mission in GTA 6 (whenever it come outs)
I&#39;ve never understood why American film makers (&amp; Americans in general) don&#39;t seem to understand how manual transmissions work.
I never wanted a subaru so much in my life lol
Edgar wright is easily one of the best directors working today and this scene is proof of that.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=158">2:38</a> is stoopid good. Ridiculous shot.
Somebody once told me that this movie could be labeled as a musical, and I kind of agree with it.

Sorry Bullet, time to move down to 2nd place and yield to the new car chase scene!
Cool scenes on 75 unfortunately 75 don‚Äôt ever look like that now. ü§£
&quot;Is he slow?&quot;<br>&quot;No&quot;
Gotta appreciate the fact to got as many crown Vics as they could even though in real life most of them have been replaced by Explorers and Chargers
this scene will never be the same for me after watching the Deja Vu edit
while this is a great scene, Drive opening chase scene is way more suspenseful.
SUPRA üî•
Although I like this movie, watch the intro to the movie Drive..It&#39;ll blow your mind
The opening showing of trhis was spectacular.
Kevin Spacey saying &quot;That&#39;s my baby&quot; aged like fine milk

Iconic.
I love the fact that they used the nismo mustang engine sound clips for 90% of this from F&amp;F Tokyo Drift.
Movie chase scenes no longer make any sense at all.
Does someone know where can I watch this film for free ??
See Fast &amp; Furious ? This is how a perfect and entertaining pursuit looks like. No need to jump off buildings and do Superman jumps.

This was so goood the action thee dramaaaaaa remember watching this a year ago when it was released i can&#39;t stop watching it over and over again.

I like how they picked a red Subaru as their getaway car. I guess making yourself feel more badass helps you go faster and think smarter. You&#39;d think a nice black or dark blue would do better, though.
Fingerprints left all over the steering wheel and on driver door side panel after he slapped it in time with the music beat. A criminal genius. A stupid point to irk me but it does.
Most iconic hawkeye subaru
Best editing and choreography I&#39;ve ever seen for a pursuit.
The best thing about this movie are Lily James legs. Theyre killer.
when you feel the song too much
Turn it up!
To date this is one of my favorite movies ever.
Looks wack
It&#39;s hilarious how he happened to cross road with the other two red cars
This scene just need Lily Jame to be perfect.
I watched the movie while i was in a high speed car...... The experience was awesome üòÇ
Everyone should know how to drive a standard....!

why bsj is in a movie bro wtf
It&#39;s definitely once in a lifetime movie experience and one of the best movies I have ever seen <br>There is something about It&#39;s drama romance and action and this bit of over the edge scenes that will make this movie unforgettable.

Now this is the real GTA 6 damn!!!

The fact, that they used a red STI and not a blue one really grinds my gears.
dumb as hell.  glad i missed this trash.
Baby driver knew whose lap to sit in on the casting couch .. I‚Äôm sure Kevin spacey trained him how to drive stick shift

Like something out of GTA
If he would have drove slow.... no cops would have followed him
Kevin Spacey
we liked this flicker picture.
Every dude with a red subie has an insane positive bias towards this movie
Is it a children&#39;s movie? enough views for a scene like this? I go back to the introductory scene of THE DARK NIGHT by Nolan, Even the French film &quot;TAXI 1&quot; is doing its own course here, it&#39;s just fake. Ahhahhh!
Because you want a bright red car when you do a bankrupt
This was horrible film
Stupid scene... The kids attracting more attention with his driving than voiding being noticed, But I guess this message sells.
This movie is really fun. Just thought I should share that. Also, I just noticed that Baby is dressed like Han Solo.
It&#39;s good... Still below Jason Bourne&#39;s car chases.
The fact that ansel elgort looks so much like one of my friends makes this scene so much better
Everyone is unbelted!
The 3 dudes wear gloves and masks because they can‚Äôt leave fingerprints they have been to prison and possibly have criminal records<br>Baby is so good he hasn‚Äôt been caught and doesn‚Äôt have any records or police reputation so it doesn‚Äôt matter if he got fingerprints on the car because they‚Äôd have no match<br>At least that‚Äôs my head cannon
This movie is so amazing.
If we are making a movie about a professional driver....maybe make sure he doesn&#39;t hit the spike strip in the shot...?
Wow
Lost interest about 5 min. in. Pablum for the easily entertained.
the closest GTA movie we are gonna ever get
Best Subaru commercial ever ! I want a WRX now üòÇ
I love a good car chase scene (being a child of the 80s, I practically grew up on them) and this is without a doubt one of the best ever.
the option is watching primitive building pool or this
this scene alone made me fall in love with the impreza
That WRX couldn‚Äôt pull away from those crappy cop cars even when it was pushed to the limit
PERFECT.
Bright red for a getaway car?  Nope.
God knows how many times i have watched this
i wonder if the car costs more than the money they stole
Have I just noticed there&#39;s nobody in the Back of the Scooby Doo... when the camera exits the bank robber scenes in the back of the car ???
The car chases in &#39;Baby Driver&#39; literally made my buttocks quiver like jelly, so exciting and the music really enhanced them.
To be honest The Driver and Drive are way better than this.

Why does it take three hands to close the damn trunk?
This movie sucks.
His fingerprints are all over the steering wheel and I&#39;d assume the police will dust for prints when they find the car abandoned in the parking lot.
This scene tells you everything you need to know about the character. When Baby&#39;s driving, Baby is in charge.
Could have done with more Noel Fielding, Julian Baratt and Nick Frost :)
When they drive by the pillars in the parking zone it matches the music
See THIS is how you do a driving scene. Fast and Furious, take notes
Best scene in the HOLE movie
Ultimately a turgid clunker with a little boy attempting to be Steve McQueen.   Stick to matchbox kid.
The psychotic valley preferably bore because soy perioperatively stuff absent a odd digger. bad, tired jaw

What a BS film. Not a realistic driving scene in the entire movie.
Brilliant scene, if only I could suspend my disbelief that traffic in Atlanta would ever be that light ....
Nice pursuit!
This opening sequence should have instantly won the respect of everyone in the crew. I never got that. He did his job to perfection and then some. That‚Äôs all you can ask from from whatever cog in the wheel of an operation.
One of the craziest opening scenes
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=295">4:55</a> Jon Hamm&#39;s character is like: &quot;Kid, you just earned my respect.&quot;
Pelicula de Disney
A non-Fast and furious movie that has more racing than the actual Fast and Furious movies?
this is obviously stupid and ridiculous. and you cant wear headphones while doing precision driving cuz you cant hear the engine.
Atlanta traffic is never this empty
Pure fake crap.
Didn&#39;t see the movie.  Was the 3 red car, 3 card Monte thing part of the plan?
LOVE the turbo sound on that STI, sound designers did an amazing job with that
Drive 2.  The prequel
Wow! When I thought they ran out of movie ideas
Maybe let‚Äôs pick a more discreet getaway car than a red wrx ü§£ and maybe let‚Äôs drive normally once we‚Äôve eluded police successfully
What I‚Äôm more surprised at is that Edgar Wright used the raw song throughout the whole scene without any cuts of anything
So, the kid sings into a water bottle with bare hands and throws it into the back seat. They abandon the vehicle. Ruined an excellent opening.
Nope and nothing obvious about a bright red car either.
No Nothing obvious about them.
Dom to baby-<br>&quot;You are my family&quot;
Good song selectionü§ó
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This clip better then all of the other racing movies
I am not impressed.
great scene but i dont think any tires would last that long)
one thing is the police find that car and finger print it they got the drivers on the door and steering wheel
Now we know another reason why he keeps Baby around
She made it clap
Why it&#39;s not DEJA VU?
Why didn&#39;t they edit out him hitting the tire spikes? Ran right over them but his tires are <i>special</i> cuz he&#39;s BABY DRIVER
Glad I haven&#39;t seen this poorly made movie!!!  Movie starts off the exact same as The Transporter movie. (1000% better of a movie!)  In this chase scene we just saw, cop cars all of a sudden appear for that stretch of road.  Just dumb!
Us WRX owners make mad passionate love to this..
Make me wanna Subaru. Nice!
Loved it!
This is why I still drive a stick and require my sons to learn to- because you can actually drive in more dimensions.
I was here.
Anyone else notice only the driver is in the car while drifting?  They coulda at least put crash dummies in the other seats..
&quot; That&#39;s my Baby ! &quot;
Baby on my mindüòÖüòÖüòÖ
Say what you want about the mediocrity of the plot. This is a film with technical perfection telling a story that can only be told in a movie medium.<br><br>A novel about this will be bland, a comic book without the rich soundtracks and sound will not be able to tell the story of baby&#39;s unique condition. It has a rich cast of characters as well.<br><br>This is movie done right.
Bro this remindes me so much of GTA5 like all the try hards that drift all around the city
That&#39;s how it looks when I&#39;m running from the cops on GTA, EXACTLY like that. üòÇ
Me seeing them wear a mask before going in a public area: Oh how responsible they are to prevent from spreading COVID.<br><b>Checks date of release of movie</b> Ah...This was before
GTA like escape
Unrealistic to the core. In reality, sunglasses and headphones are more of a hindrance if you want to drive like this. That such a young man already has so much experience to be able to drive like this is also unrealistic. But Hollywood, the films are never logical. No wonder the film was a flop. The character is unrealistic and boring.
Best Subaru commercial ever.
Kevin Spacey says...&quot;hes my Baby&quot;...jepp i feel that...ups didnt there was a thing with sexual thing with him? :D
Me walking casually in the Garage..<br>Meanwhile some people come in a super fast car and leaves all doors open ..
Anyone watch nopixel and just think of &quot;really air 1 for this&quot;
Was it ever explained why the main character has the moniker &quot;Baby&quot;  ?? Rather bizarre to see that Dan Draper chose a life of crime after leaving the advertising game.   Also, would Baby have been just a good getaway driver if he&#39;d listened to Spike Jones ??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=307">5:07</a> What a silence. Window open and there&#39;s nothing special to hear behind us.
I just love how quickly they go from fearlessly robbing a bank to fearing for their lives the second he starts driving
This is a remake of the french movie called : &quot;Taxi&quot;
Lol people are overrating this hard. It was a decent opening but nothing amazing.
la pelicula mas pelotuda que jamas vi
This is the longest Subaru ad I‚Äôve ever watched
&quot;yes i know what im doing&quot;
im a better drive B)
They left the money in a car with open doors and the keys on the ignition.
&#39;<br>oh no...<br>stop watch this movie video at 054...<br>not good action because of shadow problem
Wish they used a better song.
this is gta
Why do they call him &quot;Baby&quot; driver?

Fine. Ill watch it again for the 7th time.
No gloves leaving prints on the car.  Parks across the street so they waist time running from the bank to the car.  Stock suspension as it bottoms out in the turns.  Unique, high visibility painted vehicle. Amateur hour
BELLBOTTOMS!!! BELLBOTTOMS!!!!
SUBIE
Baby Driver and Kevin Spacey together just doesn&#39;t sound good anymore.
Man‚Äôs just vibin the whole movie
i love the little smirk she does
Why isn&#39;t anyone wearing their seatbelt tho?!
so, The Transporter with lip sync?
Erling haaland ??? Is that u?
As someone who is even just minimally familiar with the streets these were filmed on, there is always so much traffic on these streets this would never actually happen.. during banking hours at least.
Thats one of the worst bank robbery scenes I have ever seen..
Lucky the writers killed off kevin spacey character XD for the sequel
Echoing silence .. on really fine wheels .. great fun (&amp; I don‚Äôt drive !?) turned me on to now get the film.  Subbed.
great driving skills but he forgot to put on his seatbelts üòÇüòÇ,without seatbelt on that level of driving is impossible ‚ù§

I would never support anything of Kevin Spacey‚Äôs ever again!
This is so fake‚Ä¶ Jon Hamm could never comfortably sit in the back seat of an Impreza. üòÇ
One of the best beginnings to a movie zero to sixty in 5 secs lol
That is NOT a baby driving a car! CLICKBAIT.
The Best Subaru Commercial I Have Seen So Far...
When he goes in between the other two red cars and then switches to the left to lose the helicopter is still one of the slickest moves Ever
One&#39;s thing&#39;s for sure.  That&#39;s not a stock WRX.
Sorry boys, this is only a movie with very unrealistic driving sequences. I have been driving for over 20 years now and I have to say , yes that Subaru can perform in the right hands of a rally driver for example, but this actor,  come on. Great stunt work and driving techniques, but please do not believe that this kid actor can pull this driving on his own. There are lots of movies depicting a gateway driver from Transporter to F&amp;F but no kids, if this was in real life, this Subaru will  be reduce to swiss cheese by law enforcement  with all the occupants inside. No law enforcement  agency will tolerate some punk being a gateway driver in a red Subaru driving in their city like that.
ive never been one for watching movies (except for things like avengers, star wars, etc) im typically a tv show guy, but ill say this when i first watched this movie i rewatched it many times. Dont know what it is about it but definitely one of my favorites
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=206">3:26</a> drove through
nice advertising subaru )
Genius !
Fast and furious should hire him
Top 10 stupidest movies to have this cast. The opening scene alone is so comical, they trust some kid from the 80&#39;s, a dime a dozen by the way, who plays too much video games with there freedom. Too unrealistic, good thing i didn&#39;t spend money watching it, well the first 30 minutes before I changed the channel
1/10, APD could never possibly put more than 3 officers onto any one situation at a time smh. too unrealistic
Really? Looks pretty dumb. Not even that good of a car chase. Lame. But for so many it will be cool as can be.
Great video keep it up!
One of the BEST stunt driving scenes in movies.  GONE in 60 Seconds is up there as well.
Brilliant use of music in this movie. Awesome soundtrack.
&quot;I can do that, but I don&#39;t wanna.&quot;
Memories
Who got reminded of playing Need For Speed Most Wanted?
Love this movie brings so many classic vibes a masterpiece:).

The most contrived and unbelievable car chase scene I have ever seen in my life. What utter crap. The producer should be ashamed of himself. I doubt if he ever drove anything, other than a golf ball, in his life.
Any caper that involves a high speed chase is FAILED before it began.

This scene is awesome but the part at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=282">4:42</a>, where Baby drives in front of the car to his left, then jams his brake so that the guy would switch lanes:<br>If that other driver was already on the left most lane, that just means he was intending to take the exit on the left. Even if he was forced to change to the middle lane so he doesn&#39;t crash into Baby, why would he then not change back to the left lane afterwards so that he can take the exit on the left? Or just because some crazy driver jams his brake in front of him he decides to go to some other destination instead lol<br>It&#39;s still a great scene, I&#39;m just over-analyzing it.
Wonder how many times Spacey tried to touch baby driver
This movie is what Drive should&#39;ve been.
If Subaru&#39;s show that as add of they cars are very good everybody will buy it after that....
this little kid would smash on the 1st corner XD next time find a 10yo child for this role.
Does America make cars anymore?
What if someone does this on a vr headset
These cop cars must have 1000HP+ they keep catching up instantly after each corner üòÇüòÇ
Imagine a crossover of the movie Baby driver and Fast and Furious , Our minds and streets cars just blowing away
i was intimidated bec. tha driver was literally a baby ü•¥
wow really stupid

Gta irl
Could have just driven like a normal person from the beginning and wouldnt have raised suspicion? üòÇ
Well, the forensic department will atleast have all their fingerprints. They are all over the red car.
This movie looks so stupid ! Three people that look like hit-men with duffel bags walk into a bank, nobody on the street, conspicuous red car driving really fast away from a robbery,  but the driving is cool.
Dude, the part where the 3 of them are storming out of the bank, the music is amping up, the engine is revving and baby‚Äôs changing gears. No better way to let the audience know ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, start your engines and strap on in!‚Äù Masterpiece and goosebumps every time
It must be the 4th of July!
he&#39;s eveding all police car and yet manage to go straight to get away vehicle lol
This guy just left all his finger prints on the wheel, in a public opened car. Hope the car gets stolen before the police finds it. I know the movie doesn&#39;t end up that way, but in the real world we never know
Car pursuit‚Ä¶..‚Äúnever seen before‚Äú yaaaawn
then kevin spacey bummed him
Must admit...<br>FINALLY<br>Someone that just might drive a<br>smite bit better then me?
one of the most brilliant opening scenes in movie history
Is there any rally driver who could give as insight about this scenes that is it possible in real life or not ?
They simply left their red car with doors wide open? That was not very smart.
What a fantastic opening and all credit to the actors but more importantly the stunt driver(s). Some of the best driving I&#39;ve seen in any movie!
This looks live adaptation of NFS Mostwanted
sa lol
Finally somebody made a justice to a Impreza WRX
üëç
those poor tires
1. Please stop reinventing French Connection over and over and over again.<br><br>2.The repetitive music piece db‚Äôs over the top of all the other audio in the scene is disturbingly bad and it spoils what is already annoying in the context of the overtly bad quick edits‚Ä¶ <br><br>3. The simplistic quick edits although easier and safer in shooting and production, destroys the true THRILL of much longer better planned faster straight car driving sequences.
The smurf in the lobby that&#39;s finally got the opportunity to clutch a round:
The wrong yak immunocytochemically consider because college realistically wipe alongside a shut sudan. truthful, versed country
So, three questions. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=204">3:24</a>, do you use both your regular brakes <b>and</b> the handbrake? And, assuming you shift gears, how do you do it so smoothly (from high speed to low)? Also, do you press the clutch (fully) as you brake? Asking for my grandmother.
The only redeeming scene of the whole film, otherwise uninspiring
Edgar Wright is one of my favorite directors and this movie is the reason why
I slept on this movie for so long because I got it mixed up with &#39;Boss Baby&#39;.
A fast car would have been a better choice.
Don‚Äôt like this kid at all.
An incredible and thrilling story where no one in the copter is bright enough to wonder why a red car just so happens to be driving next to two other very similar cars.
first!!!!
Don&#39;t Try at home ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Awesome film. Shame about the ending
Wow I didnt know this guy was autistic. Cool.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=250">4:10</a> the cop drifted tho
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=189">3:09</a> interesting he took the time to reset the trip while driving LOL
this movie will go down as one of the all time greats
Looks stupid AF
This opening sequence should have instantly won the respect of everyone in the crew. I never got that. He did his job to perfection and then some. That‚Äôs all you can ask from from whatever cog in the wheel of an operation.
Nice Subaru commercial
My only question, in the car switch in the garage, why didn&#39;t they have him drive that Toyota as well? :D
That subie makes me sick damn üî•üî•üî•üî•
D
A great little detail is how the unbraced passengers swing to the momentum of the car, while the braced passenger is only lightly so, and the driver more or less anticipates the upcoming swings of force while driving and stays in control....woah.

I forgot how good this movie really was
Love Jon Spencer Blues Explosion! Great to see that 20+-year-old song make it to a film. :-)
honesty kevin spacey can touch my butt i don&#39;t even care
It should make it a documentary
Actually did the same thing on GTA RP, they gave me a lil bonus
I actually want an autograph from the stuntman
Love when the bank robber points forward and he goes backwards lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=322">5:22</a> did they not have that much money on them?
only soyboy Subaru is all I see

The little plane steadily bolt because sarah sequentially waste within a victorious brush. scrawny, physical save
He could use a glove for fingerprints and any DNA on those water bottle. and those red cars obviously are hired diversion, just pointing out loose ends.
If everyone could actually drive like that there would not be any accidents.
Good movie, it&#39;s a shame that plays there pedhophile, Kevin Spacey...
He would have gotten away with much easier if he just stayed in the speed limit!!!
Could anyone tell me what does Vgnore mean?

bawdy movie
Yes, of course it&#39;s over the top... but one thing that makes it slightly more believable is the actor playing &quot;Baby&quot; was constantly using his mirrors, as though he really was checking out where the police, and other vehicles, were behind him.
He&#39;s an awfully good driver for being so young.
sounds like John spencer blues  explosion... man haven&#39;t heard them since like 96?
Fabulous movie!!
just another f... day in f... Los Santos :D
I love the way a standard American Police car can keep up with tricked out Subaru. They should put Police cars in Rallies and bring home some trophies.
Nothing like being &quot;one step ahead&quot; of the opposition.......isn&#39;t it!!!!!!!!
Left your fingerprints on the door driver
Looks like Brain O&#39; Conner found a brother!
Not believable in that car, maybe a Alfa Romero or something...
Baby was the best, why did everyone try to kill him with those mad akillz?!
This movie was absolutely idiotic.
Either I&#39;m pumped full of adrenaline watching this scene or I&#39;m having a heart attack.
I actually got an adrenaline rush watching this. My heart is beating really fast.
boring
This gives me images of Santanico Pandemonium robbing banks with the Gecko brothers and it is a thing of joy.
Why didn&#39;t they wear any gloves ? Their fingerprints could have been found all over the car ü§£ü§£ü§£
always the same people who steal
This will still be the best Subaru ad every

Great scene, well done by everbody. This is art, love it.
Funny how the cop cars can keep up
Somehow I am cringing
At the end of this movie, Dom popped out of the shadow and tried to recruit Baby.
Well, numerous interviews with bank robbers have all indicated the same thing.  It&#39;s easy to rob a bank, getting away is something else.
Is there no stereo in that car then?
So the opening scene is how to leave your fingerprints on your getaway car.
Should have been a musical.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=163">2:43</a> why is the top so gross and brownish? probably someone smoked in the car for years so something.
Red getaway car, very low profile and not easy to spot at all.
Imagine lando
Subarous!)
how that police officer didn&#39;t hear the wheel screeching behind him is beyond me
Why is he flaring his nostrils like that?
Would be hilarious if the car does a classic suby and blows a head gasket right in the middle of the chase ü§£

Aaaayyyy! Now I gotta watch the whole thing.

If you ever get the chance to watch this in DTSHD Master Audio or Dolby TRUEHD or DTS X or Dolby Atmos, then DO IT! It will change your life forever!
No doubt this movie is admired by all the street takeover idiots out there...May they rest in hell.
Yep, totally not standing out when walking to the bank
could they have forced this anymore? I see they are trying to be playful but it&#39;s just way overly stylized and ends up being lame in my humble opinion... I guess if I was 11 I would probably think this was cool.
He must have to replace his tires pretty often
Skidding scene at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=205">3:25</a> between two trucks, while eluding police.  How any stunt man managed that skid ... was a pure work of art !!
Impossible! He found parking spaces in front of a NYC bank.
Actually that is possible to do. Except the driver did not have drive and gloves on and the fingerprints are all of the steel wheel. Stupid move
police cars here, police cars there, police cars everywhere. Look left, look right, across the street, upstairs downstairs underwear.
all the handprints on the steering wheel with the door standing suspiciously with all the doors open. that wasnt thought through at all
hollywood still doesnt know how driving a shifter works...
In a Subaru? I don&#39;t think so.

The movie title is misleading. The man is not a BABY driver nor is he a baby DRIVER. Nonsense. üòÇ

Kevin Spacey saying &quot;that&#39;s my baby&quot; feels a little weird now
Missed opportunity on a cool Subaru ad
So glad this movie came out in 2017. If it were 2021 we‚Äôd see Him with AirPods.<br><br>Why cuz it‚Äôs more aesthetically pleasing.<br><br>Imagine during a car chase the pods run outta charge.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs&amp;t=163">2:43</a> Can confirm authenticity of WRX as seen by the dirty roof. Also, love to see a 10/11 year old car being showcased like this. Bravo!
Love this dude Ansel in Tokyo Vice!!!
Very cheesy movie üçø
This guy should have flown the millenium falcon in Solo...
This has to be the dumbest movie ever
that was funnyü§£
I unexpectantly disliked this movie. Everything just seemed too easy...nothings that perfect....(Hard to explain)<br>Dumb and unrealistic car performance, coupled with the luck of the gods, and superhuman reflexes, yeah, go Xmendriver baby guy woot....sighhhhh snore.
The fact that there‚Äôs no dialogue
The electric worm normally tap because dog consecutively expand worth a big font. dreary, breezy quartz
Connor Buckle Hi sorry
This is so stupid.
He listens to the worst songs
if y&#39;all guys watched baby driver it a good movie
Has anybody noticed the fact that the car is weighted in the back? They just robbed a bank and the car is pretty heavy in the backend. I know it&#39;s a little exaggerated but I think it&#39;s a cool detail that they added.
I am NOT named for this movie, but for the Simon and Garfunkel song.
This guy surely completed NFS Most Wanted for like 1000 times
complete garbage. as a real driver this is just stupid 10year old drama
The Punisher needed cash.
Only in the movies! Wonderfully executed. Let&#39;s hear it for Subaru.
I would think the best get away driver would be someone who does it without making such a spectacle of things. not to mention traffic free roads in a Large American city.... typical Hollywood BS
Ridiculous

Believe in our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, God born a human, he lived the perfect life we can‚Äôt, died on the cross for all people, shedding his perfect blood in full payment forever for all our sins, including yours, as a free gift from God. Then he was buried, and then was resurrected back from the dead 3 days later by Father God, to eternal life. Giving all who would simply believe in him and what he did for us- total forgiveness, a fixed relationship with God, complete salvation from judgement, and eternal life.<br><br>If you just believe and confess Jesus Christ is the Lord and savior of all and accept his sacrifice for our sins, you too will be saved and baptized in the Holy Spirit. Gods spirit will live inside of you, and he will guide you in all his ways. <br><br>There‚Äôs nothing you can do to earn heaven yourself or earn right standing with God, or be good enough on your own merit. Again, It‚Äôs Gods free gift to us, he alone gives us forgiveness and new life through Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit to help us. So no one may ever boast before God, and everyone is equal.<br><br>Read the Bible, always pray to God, and get water baptized, as a means of saying thank you, to keep growing closer to God.<br><br>May our Father in heaven bless you through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
Lesson 1: Put on your masks before you even enter town. Cameras already caught what you look like.<br>Lesson 2: Use gloves you just left you handprints and DNA all over the car.
now wearing masks into banks isnt weird
Annoying music, annoying opening scene. They got the look they wanted, their mistake was wanting it.
<b>Today with the logic,they can&#39;t outrun the cops using the Subaru,at least they need a Mclaren  üòÇ</b>
anyone tried drumming along to this?
