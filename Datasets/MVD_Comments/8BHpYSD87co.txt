Embarrassed to see Linc having to do this... His brother should rescue him
They really messed that character up. In the comic books Albrecht &quot;Baron&quot; Krieger was an enemy of Captain Marvel (Shazam nowadays since DC lost the right to its original name). Baron Krieger was initially named &quot;Captain Nazi&quot;, but that character was <b>NOT</b> a Mr. Hyde thing. He could easily overpower Atom and Vixen. Give them the aid of Hawkman and Hawkwoman, that still woudn&#39;t enough. To take down that character it required Shazam, or Superman, Green Lantern (the original one whose ring didn&#39;t work against wood), the Flash or something. Sad thing to see a character created that long ago, being that powerful, is made a fool of in this show. But still, better they make fools of the villains.<br>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BHpYSD87co&amp;t=102">1:42</a> I don&#39;t really know why Krieger is running, I mean, that guy can fly. Why is he running instead?
This scene made me drop the show
Dead island 1 final boss fight be like
Andre Eriksen is also a legendary norwegian rapper from the group Warlocks.
this looks like a sci-fi original. DC really needs to step their game up.
UGH this BLOWS🤢
This is what you gwt when you order the hulk on wish.

That’s an awful lot like the Hulk😊
He&#39;s like a perfect version of &quot;G&quot; which William Birkin could only dream for.

When you pull out the ps2 for nostalgia
THE WHITE HULK.....HMMPH
Wow he looks like the SS version of the hulk maybe SS hulkamania is next lol
Great.. I&#39;m off...

The physics in this are absolutely awful.
He&#39;s not evil, just in pain. Those pants aren&#39;t elasticated and they must be cutting off his blood supply. All he wants is some help. :(

Ah the evil Nazi...again...Hollyweird  pls get another enemy this one is warn out

What a stupid movie
Bad CGI
Feiao
Dc really needs to work on their cinema. Their stories and characters are ok, especially the main Justice League which are my favorite, but DC needs to work on their effects, their publishing, their directing, their plotting, their story writing… Nothing but love but I expect more

Prime reason I never watched this show after season 1 cheesy special effects. The story and actors are great though
Hulk solos
Bro, how are they becoming even worst than marvel?
It&#39;s the Red Hulks little brother! It&#39;s funny how he&#39;s an Army commander just like Ross LoL<br>What&#39;s next a super strong man from another planet named &quot;Super Human&quot; who gets his strength from the Lunar light and his only weakness is a glowing blue rock they call Cripstonight!
What a joke 😂
Wtf is this? how are there 8 seasons of it?who watchs these? So many questions.....
hulk copy paste
Hulk on crack.
I think I&#39;ll just stay with cartoons and animes for now 🙂<br>They seem more.... Mature?
This is a 2021 show…. This looks like some terrible CGI from 2001
This feels like a fever Dream, i still can&#39;t believe it actually happened.
Wtf is this
They musta had some talented grade school kids, cuz thats the peak of this quality 🤣
This is hilarious
corny
what is the name of this injection😂
This is so amazing..... The action and CGI was even better than &quot;no way home&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s &quot;No Way back.&quot; In my opinion.
It sucks

Bad cgi jokes aside - this character is an evil nazi steroid hulk??

German Hulk :D
Haha Baron Krieger... German super duper hero ;)
Wow just as shitty as she hulk
Too bad it&#39;s a cheap knockoffs of the Avengers. The creators can&#39;t even come up with their own ideas
Total vandalisation of the DC brand. Yikes.
Put this moron next to the Hulk!  the hulk will smash him.
And there are people who say She-hulks cgi is bad.

<b>Hulk versi low budget 😂🙏</b>
estamos en el año 2022 buck rogers, volver al futuro predijeron cosas maravillosas, pero ver esta animacion realmente me hace dudar de todo y pensar asi como la humanidad esta retrocediendo las animaciones, los videojuegos, las peliculas tambien?? que nos pasa ?? la degradacion no es solo cultural.
Пиздец какой-то
И что доктор волшебником был? Да нет, просто по любви не соскучился! Спасибо режиссеру - за большого парня!

Хорошо сняли..
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Какая же уебищная графика😂
I thought this was Super Buu with a new cut ..
CW makes constant shit. It’s always soap opera level acting and painful with watch.
lol why is this show still running? except for that the cast needs a job. in which case thank God it&#39;s still running but this is just really bad.
When I thought Solomon Grundy was DC&#39;s version of the Hulk boy was I wrong!!! Lol 😂
I want to see a fight between Hulk vs. This Guy
I can make this VFX for only 100$

This is like power rangers for adults, a whole other level of subversion and subjugation. Hell all this could be happening right now but no consistent stream of accurate information coupled with everyone being emotionally invested in fake shows like this, really would be the perfect way to pull the wool over everybody’s eyes.
So he&#39;s like a German Hulk?!?!
Baron krieger is like mr hyde

Awful CGI
Acting is terrible, hits aren&#39;t connecting at all. You have to sell the fight. Pro wrestlers in WWE make fighting look much more realistic and violent than this.    Captain Nazi growls like a demon monster. Costumes make everybody look like a bunch of crazy LARPers.  CGI is pretty good.
is this hulk and the blitzkreig added
The audio for the character 💀💀💀

probably worst CGI I&#39;ve ever seen.. 😭😭😭
If they wanted a ripped Nazi should have just hired Arnie .
I lost interest in this show. Maybe I&#39;ll take another look
Such a nice shirt ruined like that. Should remove it before hulking up.
Deixei de assistir esse seriado só lacracao

If CGI was done with MS Paint.
L.O.L
Just need Budget
oh shit I thought it was Red Hulk.
Hulk  made in chine😂😆
Good lawd that’s horrible
Close your eyes and watch this video.....sounds like you&#39;re watching The Avengers...
This makes me happy I stopped watching cw dc super hero shows

Damn that&#39;s some real low budget effects there 👀
🤮
Holly shit. Watching this made me realize DC suck even more!!!
Que efectos tan pésimos invirtieron 5$ en este filme,pesimo
I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the most horrible of acting and special effect, but it&#39;s definitely in the threshold
What&#39;s Movies name
My god this is cringe
I seriously hope DC didn&#39;t make this.<br><br>I don&#39;t mind the fact that it&#39;s on par with 1980&#39;s style action super hero T.V. shows.<br>The CGI however is very out of place with an 80&#39;s like quality, superhero show.<br>The rest of my criticism lies with all of the generic copy cat characters.  Especially the CGI Nazi Hulk.  For shame DC!!!<br><br>&quot;Stick to Superman and Batman movies, DC Comics&quot;!
Which series is this
Reminds me of the rediculous African films cgi
Better CGI than Halo TV shitshow
Tosco
A poor version of hulk is what it looks like
Caramba, que negócio mal feito, parece jogo de Play Station 2
So this is the copycat version of the hulk..  a white terrible,weak version of hulk ?
This Guy is just like a Heroin addict

What the ...? 😧
super corny and cheesy the show&#39;s trying to entertain seven-year-olds or insulting its viewer&#39;s intelligence I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m watching make-believe at all.
Uhm.......NO.
It&#39;s funny how there shirt always rips but there pants don&#39;t 😂
WHO ASKS QUESTIONS IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT? AND HE WAS CLEARLY RUNNING TWICE, IF NOT, THREE TIMES FASTER THAN THAT MOTORCYCLE.
Idk what to say about this.........sucks I guess.
Basically me as I exit Planet Fitness after working out
I think its better if they hire bigger man .. 8 feet guy.. and just put on make up..
This guy&#39;s a drug addict.
DC U has the worst cgi
Damn that was painful to watch
Мотоцикл Урал?
Pretty sad fight scene
You think this is awful? Lol try to watch Philippine series and movies 😂 not all but almost everything 😅 I&#39;m korean btw
This looks terrible
The budget for this is amazing, let alone the effects. Surprising I never watched it before. My only question is why do all large creatures have to growl and roar, especially while running?
Its like watching a 90s show
Cheap ass production
Did they spend $40 on their cgi? This show sucks.
And this is why I miss Blue&#39;s Clues

Hahaha! Wtf? 😁
The CGI fits to the actor skills :-D
This would be amazing if it was made 20 years ago. But 2016?? Cmon now, i myself am a gfx artist, and could probably do better than this.
oh damn that motercycle allmost made it to 40mp/h, my scooter can drive 65mp/h down a hill. So the guy got some steriods and now his bulletproof, flameproof, and beats Ursain Bolt in a sprint.<br><br>This is why i&#39;d rather watch Peacemaker :D
Looks like a Colossus from Days Gone.

Ooooookay.  We already have a green Hulk.  Now, this one is a regular human skin color and a lot skinnier.....(???).  They need something different - not our Hulk. It&#39;s kinda stupid - if you ask me.
Extremely stupid people are criticizing the CGI.
This is probably some of the worst CGI I’ve ever seen 😂
Клёвое ширево! Где можно купить такой шприц?
How nice of the monster guy to teleport a few meters back to the bombs could hit him and not our heroes!
Economist budget film
I don&#39;t know why they are making DC stuff like this.. Isnt warner bros one of the most richest companies in history?

If it were a Toy they would think it was the cheap copy of the hulk
So PG had to stop watching after it became a kids show.
This looks so bad it&#39;s embarrasing to look at. Like it&#39;s made for 8 year olds or something.
Low budget hulk 😆
Looks like a group of cossplayers playing on an angry old man&#39;s property and he goes apeshit on their asses like &quot;get off my lawn&quot;
Realy dc ? 🤣🤣
This is a shit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BHpYSD87co&amp;t=108">1:48</a> this man has no idea how to operate a motorcycle.

Tf is this? Did the actors rly agree to make this movie public with those special effects? You got no pride as good actors? Fk them money, they can&#39;t buy you respect from your fans..
Whats your power? <br><br>I have a shotgun
Cómo se llama la película
With series the cg can&#39;t be blamed! Can get better but with time and budget into consideration just smalll corrections would have got it better! Never blame tho the work put into making this isn&#39;t easy after all
Man can you believe this is almost 5 years d this October-november I remember watching it when it first aired back in 2016
Horrible cgi
Looks like it was filmed in my backyard
Talk about low budget lol
I do not understand why people waste money on making such bad quality movies?
What in the Walmart Avengers is this?😭

I can tell the haters that can they make something better than this?
whoever made this movie obviously has no idea how a motorcycle throttle actually works.....
Who else was thinking Red Hulk with a blond wig?
This some low budget bullshit lmao
It probably would have been cheaper to get The Mountain to do it.

When I saw this clip.. I thought it was a scene from a 2003 movie or sum
Mister Ryder?
Was this from the 80s?  The CGI is terrible!  Whenever I see scenes like this, I can&#39;t help but imagine how incredibly stupid the actors must feel while filming that...it&#39;s utterly ridiculous...
I used to watch this show and i stopped.
Man, this is beyond bad...

MISSING  <b>*</b>
People are showing too much <b>hate</b> towards it. I know it isn&#39;t the best looking CGI we have in tv. But you should understand that this show have a huge cast which work in different environments every episode. Also, it&#39;s not like it is the main villain. Just a very side character who came for an episode for a few mins.<br>It is basically Hulk. But for tv....for a show with not so high budget.... With alot more CGI to do for many of characters.... For a few mins for an episode. By that standards. It&#39;s good.<br>Also, i know it isn&#39;t a masterpiece but i like this show. It is mindless and stupid at times but it&#39;s something i can enjoy at least 😂
Pretty decent special effects. Did it come out in 97?

All together, including the children, we pass to the Eternal Father !!!Indications for the treatment * <a href="http://www.padreceleste.com/">www.padreceleste.com</a> Dear brothers! I take this opportunity to offer you mutual and collective cooperation through prayer, let me explain it right away: together with some of you, I formed a prayer group called &quot;ReteTrinità&quot;, which consists of a community of universal brotherhood based on love of God the Father. Every evening after lunch or before going to bed, we hold prayers in each of the houses with other participants scattered around different parts of the world. The prayer takes place on the knees and with the union of the hands, starting moderately with Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; (Importantly ... we do not share our hands, because the Eternal communicates with the soul and we lose contact.) The moment we begin to pray, we may be disturbed by external forces, such as thoughts, useless things, delirium and much other . another. everything leaves the prayers, because even if we wanted to find something, it would be impossible to do, so we will start with a greeting addressed to God and with the phrase &quot;Hello, God ..&quot;; Immediately, there is a message about the problems that concern us, asking for help from the Eternal. Our prayer group draws from the church three main prayers, pater, ave and gloria (the simplest and best known by people) and offers them the opportunity to speak with God in the family, where you can talk about everything with the Almighty, from small everyday <br>things to serious problems, in a word, true 360 degree dialogue. Between one joke and the other, and at the end of the conversation, it is necessary to repeat once Pater, Avemaria, Gloria; Therefore, praying together, the presence of God is present simultaneously in all hearts, and this facilitates His intervention. Having benefited, it was decided to repeat the morning and / or afternoon prayers. Obviously, if your daily duties do not allow you to pray in the morning or in the afternoon, do not worry: you can transfer it to another hour of the day, the Eternal understands and knows why you are doing it. However, it is important that the evening prayer be performed without fail. I guarantee you the absolute benefit of the method used so far and I assure you that dialogue with the Almighty frees the soul from pollution and brings peace and prosperity. I express my most sincere congratulations on my behalf and on behalf of the other brothers in the prayer group, hoping to be more numerous. a hug Altynai Isabaev I received this teaching of prayer in a social network from a girl, who advised me to read it carefully, not to delete it, to offer it to the family and to give it to friends, because it will be appreciated better than any good food, as it is useful to improve the soul! he sent it to make God known <br>The sign of the cross, <br>Our Father <br>who is in heaven, holy is his name, your kingdom is coming, your will is being done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us our bread day by day, and forgive our sins as we forgive those who trespass and sin against us, and help us not to fall into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen <br>Hail Mary, <br>full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus.** Holy Mary, Mother of Jesus, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen <br>Glory be to the Father, <br>to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning, as it is now and as it will be forever to come. Amen <br>*

Can&#39;t wait for the cross over <a href="https://thefamousauthor.com/around-the-world/f/its-that-time-of-the-year-the-cws-crisis-on-infinite-earths">https://thefamousauthor.com/around-the-world/f/its-that-time-of-the-year-the-cws-crisis-on-infinite-earths</a>
So he basically becomes &quot;I lift things up and put them down&quot;.
Capitan nazi
Что за бред
Rolls throttle  forward  bike speeds up.
Remember kids, just say no.
Shitty FX 😣
WTF?
D.c comics is ass for this
what a piece of shit
Hulk noob
what kind of shit is this!.....i would choose the baby shark video over this.<br>atleast we all know the producers put 0% effort in this
Like if Corridor crew should react to this
This still better than the titans Raven vs trigon
My dude be lookin like jimmy newtron
Oh I thought this was fan made but then a read the title that says something
It might just be this scene but that might be the worst cgi ive ever seen.
White hulk
Is that really something coming to the movies in 2019/2020.  I expect a flop!
World strongest pant I have ever seen in my life :D
By

U.S.A.D.A need to come down hard on this guy.
Movie name plz
Man these shows are shit
The Man Is On &quot;ROIDS&quot;!  Barry Bonds ,wasn&#39;t an alleged super hero😂🤣😂🤣
I like how on the motorcycle they show his hand back off of the throttle and the bike goes faster 😁😁😂
DC needs to stay in its lane and make more movies like Joker.
Me: Mom can we get the Incredible Hulk on the way home? <br>Mom: We have that at home. <br>Incredible Hulk at home:
Vittu mitä paskaa
Что это за гавнофильм?
Hi watch joker 2019 HD get it here https://youtu.be/ZJd1-J3iSaQ
Hulk would flick him with his index.
Что за индийская пародия на мстителей ? 😂
The cgi, acting, and Costumes are terrible
Worst CGI effects ever...this looks so cheesy
This is the most garbage chi ever made
Oh man this is bad.....
The level of stupidity is overwhelming
My eyes are filled by blood! Help me! Somebody stop them to make this shits!
He ran faster than the motorcycle, why did he get on?
White Hulk?
This video is horrible, what are you 9? Go stare at the worlds beauty, not a screen.
Nanomachines, son
Халк его в два счета на куски порвет.
How is the CW still a thing? I honestly believe it&#39;s the worst representation of DC Comics ever! They dont have the budget to accurately portray even the C- Listers and they cast the worse actors( mostly talent less models). Its superheroes for your girlfriend who doesn&#39;t give a shit about them.
Cw: hey I got 20 bucks. Y’all wanna make a show? <br><br>*how this came to be 😆
Wtf, is this fan fiction or something?
Pure, dripping cheese.
DC shows are shit
No comment
N rmmber kids.. stay away frm drugs
Buddy really really twisted the throttle the wrong way when he needed to accelerate
Why doe it look like they shot this in someones backyard using 60fps.
wow the cgi is soooooo bad lol, even fucking power rangers from the 80s was better
Just stop.
Isnt that shazam&#39;s enemy?
This is some low budget cringe...
Stretch Armstrong anyone? No? Ok.
Ugliest CGI ive ever seen
C grade movie
This show looks like shit looks like a bunch of idiots in suits fighting a really shitty enemy
Looks awful like a power rangers show the costumes and Cgi look worse that a cosplay
I mean damn they’re really giving power rangers a run for their money right now.
When you don’t know what’s more amazing the CGI or the acting. None the less it seems  like its an amazing show to watch 25 years ago.
Amazing 😱
L<br>M<br>F<br>A<br>O!!!!!!!!!
Looks dumb as fuck. I&#39;ll pass.
Халк на минимальках
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!!! Omg 😂😂😂
I thougth that was fan made when i watched this video with a differebt tittle like , hulk medecin or something like that...
Why does this look like cheap fan cosplay.... even worse than power rangers
Is this some student project?
Calm down guys its a tv show
That looked realistic 😂
Que bosta de efeito especial kkk
Is it even worth saying the special effects suck?

It&#39;s a television show and people are bitching about the CG. This isn&#39;t a fuckin&#39; 100 million dollar movie people! Get over it.
