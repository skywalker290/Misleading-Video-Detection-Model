So it&#39;s s3xy then with the roadster s3xyr and finally the semi truck s3xyst 😂😂
“MaRkAsS BrOwNly* <br>-Smith
A 7 seater? That looks so small for 7 seats feels like the back row would be extremely tight. My 2010 Honda Pilot has 3 rows and the last row is tight and that’s a pretty big car
Wish the stock aero rims were like this prototype, dark vs steel color. Looking to plastidip or powdercoat those.

What were the 3rd row seats like did you get a closer look, did any one sit in them during your ride and their thoughts.
quite the casey Neistat intro
Everyone: Did you see the review of the Model Y?<br><br>YouTube algorithm: Did you see the first impressions of the Model Y?
Tesla just lowered the price by 3000$ for the long range version
In my opinion a beautiful car! But i think i&#39;ll still save up for a Model X. Don&#39;t even got my license yet but i&#39;ll get there.
There is a 3 row now<br>Tesla in 2021
yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
When is the review coming?
Im ready for the cybertruck personally
Who is Joe?
This model might actually save Tesla .... at the base price they should sell lots .... and might actually make a profit for the first time ...  but it&#39;s going to kill Model 3 and X sales
S3XY=SEXY
If I was Elon I would continue the line of production with model B, I, T, C, H, 3, and back to S. Wdyt??
Fun fact that went we combine all the last letters of Tesla lineup we would get the word SEXY
C&#39;mon man. Third rows are always meant for children in any car.
It probably tracks down the leakers and hides them in the desser that being said I don’t class this as an suv I say the government style black trucks and all would be more suvs then this
Buy Model 3, install coil spacers and here you go!
Pontiac did a fairly good job with the Aztec redesign
Extremely ugly car
Exactly 1 year after this video- Deliveries start. Tesla is getting good at this.
Model 3+X: Y
How perfect is this video was published on March 15th??

Hi! My family won the Model Y referral raffle giveaway! We will be receiving the Founders edition next month! It’s crazy!!
another ugly car
thanks for being black and smart. really cool 2 see
Back seats will suck.
Model Y is just a confusion to the Tesla Models. Not sure what it&#39;s for.
For the uk market it’s the Polestar that’s going to make the headway, Volvo dealerships as a service option and Tesla even at this stage of evolution are still yet to establish any real presence in Blighty 🇬🇧

Just another awful looking Tesla
EPIC.
Elon in the Tesla Js
Buying it
Thanks for very very detailed about Y
I like mbkhd , everything apple pro shows that money changed him
Model Y is non good as Etron and EQC
Review nokia phones and why dont you geta mi band?
When you sit in the car did it feel like an SUV or just a regular sedan but a bit higher?
Strange. Seems that the light projection from the front light is a straight line. Is that normal in the US? In Sweden, they have to light higher in the right side (since we have right hand traffic) to light up the road side and walking paths and so.
Your commentary is great. Keep up the good work!
Why the front always look like a ducktail  the back it look so sexy but the front should be improve. Model s look very sporty the design upfront superb.
Lol confirmed Casey has bigger guns than mkbhd :p
The new Bmw MX6 design ! That&#39;s what I call a SUV
Tesla needs a new design department. Everything&#39;s getting ugly.
Congrats ten mill
S3XY😂 I love Elon for that 😂😂
casey neistat liberal jackass..peace out
An ad for Rick Ashley&#39;s <i>Never Gonna Give You Up</i> played before your video.<br><br>I just got Rick Rolled...<br><br>In 2020...

I’m mad it has regular doors
When they make a black Freddy Kruger movie this guy should go audition
Modely does look sexy.
Stick with selling whether is good or bad! lol
Where are 7 people going to put all their suitcases????? 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Ugly
It looks very low to the ground for a SUV.
honestly, the model y will probably be my first Tesla.  The X is too big and expensive.  This would be perfect for a city car.  Yes I said car.
&quot;For the 4 of you who don&#39;t know...&quot;<br><br><br>I literally just found out about it!
The blue version looks like it has chrome tho...
The line up will be S3XY CAR
Marques, “literally impossible to shoot the top window,” <br>Thomas Edison, “am I a joke to you?”
I have a question bro. I’m interested in the model y also. But was wondering if you knew - is there gonna be a standard  version AWD?  I want the AWD but don’t need the range as much. So I’m confused of what’s going on with the Y.  I just want a standard Y  All Black AWD.
I need your help buying tesla
i wonder if the long range also have awd, does naybody know?
By the way i like background music 😐 🎶
The only thing i don&#39;t like about the Model 3 and Y is that it doesn&#39;t have an instrument cluster behind the steering wheel.
So it’s S3XY CYBERTRUCK<br>subliminal messaging, I’m telling you
I want that shirt bro.
I prefer the black over the chrome tbh<br>Nice touch
Y is a good neme for it. Why the hell did you made it? It is just like model 3. Elon stop seling lies to stupid people.
F!@#$, Tesla needs to hire a designer.
fuckin love Y
Why do you say &quot;model 3&quot; and not &quot;the model 3&quot; it feels like I&#39;ve been hearing people say this so much more in this past year like the model of a car is it&#39;s own brand.
Where are your glasses?
So it is worthless if the truck is the same price?
We out here
Bruh wtf they spell out sexy
I LOVE TESLA<br>IM A FULL ON FUCKIN FANBOY AT THIS POINT<br>it is the best vehicle company and id also say the best tech company out there right now.<br>MODEL S, MODEL 3, MODEL X, MODEL Y, ROADSTER 2.0, THE SEMI, AND NOW THAT CYBERPUNK 2077 TRIBUTE STYLE CYBERTRUCK<br>I AM IN FUCKIN LOVE WITH WHAT TESLA IS DOING.<br>WITH EACH NEW CAR THAT COMES OUT I JUST WANNA SEE MORE, I WANNA SEE MORE MODELS, MORE DESIGNS, MORE INSANITY FROM ELON.
Loved the heavy Casey Neistat vibes on the intro
I&#39;ve never seen any Telsa on the road or in a parking lot yet, I question the sales numbers. It doesn&#39;t take but a month or two before I see an all new  design when it&#39;s an Accord or Canbry.
Factory chrome delete? 🤔<br>Anyone else remember the days when a matte black door handle meant you had the cheap version of the car?
I went almost 9 months not knowing this even existed. Tesla needs to advertise
Why are they only making unaffordable cars?
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=216">3:36</a> you can see Daniel Markham (from &#39;What&#39;s Inside) stand up.
FUGLY
Like a Prius
Why do people hate chrome???
The Model Y is the holy grail for most consumers. I like how it looks like a hot hatch and not an SUV which is a good thing because I don&#39;t like SUV.
Model 3 is taking over in Netherlands too like 🤯
My mum is going to get a model Y when it comes out in the UK
looks just like Model 3, just cost more ?  Whats up with Bull nose front end- very ugly and huge bug collector
Still want to see a model as functional as Volvo V70 - in order to install three rear facing child seats (25 kg top tested seats) and to have room for a Emmaljunga double seated baby carriage, without having to take off its wheels...
O god has any one notice what he did “S3XY” sexy see it yea like now
Elon needs to take over apple. Their phones are turning crap now
S <br>3<br>X<br>Y

Just the app, kkkk i don’t have car
Ohhh... That Roadster2! I&#39;ll never own one, but what a beauty to ride in! It reminds me of a Maserati, but without the racket.
big things get leaked
Was that the tesla truck behind the roadster??!?
It looks like the Tesla model x and 3 had a baby
Its just a Model 3 SUV version. Nothing special about this.
For some reason I’ve noticed nearly all YouTuber’s have a Tesla
Ugly
S3XY
thought model Y was gonna be a truck.... dam... THAT ROADSTER THO!!! o.O
So when you combine all the cars together it reads &quot;S3XY&quot;
Can any of those 20k employees put a headsup display on these things? Having to look or touch that screen for everything is probably a dealbreaker for some people. But seriously this guy is a genius, he is using his talents on a good cause, and even if you don&#39;t like the cars you have to root for his success. He is slowly changing the world and making it a better place.
model s 3 x y and later model 4 and model f

Nice Video, Do you know what Material is Handle and Those Window side area???
She&#39;s  a beast
Intro song?
Have you noticed all these Elon presentations are taking place in the night. Panel gaps are smaller in the dark. I guess.
At the end of the day, the real beauty is still roadster
If they make the interior quieter than the 3 I am sold
Only reason I didn&#39;t like the model 3 was the small interior. I&#39;m interested to see how much more space the Y has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=216">3:36</a> Who saw Dan from Whats Inside?
pick it up - famous dex ft. A$AP Rocky sample in the intro
I swear I&#39;ve heard this intro music before. Just don&#39;t know where
If you had a wife, 2 kids and a dog, would you wait for the larger Y, or get a M3 AWD now? Range is important too since we take road trips. Is the storage that much more in the Y?
ገረ
5.9 second to 60 it&#39;s fast. i remember back in 94 when a bmw m3 went under 5.8s to 60, it was huge. still fast today
another overpirced junk car
Damn, that roadster! Makes it S3XYR than all others. I&#39;m becoming a fanboy myself lol. Wish I could afford a model 3 now.
S3XY sexy
I can’t wait to see a model Y in person! I’ve driven a model S, 3 and X and they are all amazing, I expect the Y to be no less! 😊 I own a model 3 and only play to buy more Tesla’s in the future.
A tablet! its almost 2020, where is the heads-up display?!!!
It&#39;s basicaly a larger model 3... same on the inside and very similar on the outside... What&#39;s the design team doing the whole day?
Those rear seats don&#39;t even have headrests, what is this, the 80s? I thought they were all up their asses about safety?
The S3XY thing is interesting... I wonder if Elon Musk actually planned that or just came out like that... <br><br>cheers!
Basic Design Error: The Model Y misses the purpose of the vast desire and acceptance of the CUV.  The (vertical door) hatchback in all other CUVs allows comfort for our dogs and vertical height for our shopping at the big box stores.  The Model Y fastback design is a mistake, precluding both of these functions.  Form must follow function.  Aerodynamics is not as important as dogs or big store shopping.  Most of us are going across town on errands, not entering a kWh efficiency contest traversing the United States.
“Beautiful Hawthorne”<br>Yeah sure 😅😅😅😅
Nice Car
So by next year it’s gonna be complete <br>“S3XY ROADSTER”
Looks like Mazda 3 😂😂😂  but Mazda 3 looks better 😂😂 , Tesla cars I only like model s ..
What’s the music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=123">2:03</a>?
How is the leg room in the middle row, and do u sit higher then?u
never that shit
Once again the messed up designing the rear. Looks like a flat wall, model X has the same problem. The rest is ok.
S3XY lelelelelelel
I live in Portland. Model 3s are literally everywhere. I mean it isn’t as common as other brands but I see at least 3 a day on my 20 minute drive home.
Song name please  at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=121">2:01</a>?
Casey is an idiot and you&#39;re a bigger idiot for copying him......badly!!
NOT in The Netherlands, sorry..
S3xy hmmm du det what that means
I fucking hate the front hood of model 3 and Y. The car looks like a frog and not aggressive at all :(
I honesty hate Tesla’s cause they are electric the car is sick but the thing is is that it’s ganna become faster than combustion engine and I hate it farrari lambarghini gtr every super fat brands need to wake up and make something faster than that new Tesla
Been following Tesla &amp; like what the company is doing. I like the Model Y, but without a center information dash the car looks bare.
they better chrome delete on every single car. That will truly be S3XY
It&#39;s sexy but I wish it was a bit higher.  I know I know, get the X.  But it&#39;s expensive!
I see that guy from what inside  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=216">3:36</a>
😍😍😍
you are the best man, love your videos and interviews.
start sounds like Under The Sun by J.Cole
Looks like Tesla is headed downhill.
not very exciting
That coupe shape is not at all appealing
S3xy lol
Model S<br>Model 3<br>Model X<br>Model Y
Love my Model X with 30,900 miles with no maintenance or service center visits.  Very unique and overbuilt vehicle.  No ther manufacturer offers anything similar as the costs would be prohibitive.  The Model Y will be a big seller.  My Model X is $25,000 less expensive than when I purchased it.  Nice Tesla gives savings as battery prices come down.  Most other manufacturers would not do that.
Your welcome
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=190">3:10</a> wtf with your eye elon ?

I&#39;d be happily sick with just a 5seater Y... ?
It&#39;s like all the best engineers are working for Elon
getting a headache with all the shaking on your camera, before 2mins
childhood dreams do come true!
This is one of those cars if you have any brains at all would order them to be all destroyed.
S 3 X Y
If the Y indeed comes with the matte black accents it’ll look great in Simple White.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=122">2:02</a>
Looks like a hatchback
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=238">3:58</a> model 3 has a panoramic sealing too
Lol!
Not a fan of the Y.
Air suspension?
Usually for people who do buy SUV’s, they are buying them to fit their kids, so the back seats being small won’t be a problem for most people buying these. I think it looks good, even though I’m only 23 and don’t have kids or anything I would still buy this, it looks good in my opinion.. better than the model 3. <br><br>I love Elon, he’s such a cool and amazing guy.
Hmmmm I like the model Y, just put some 20inch rims lower a bit and I&#39;m set
Can&#39;t wait for his next review on Mcdonald&#39;s chicken nuggets factory
Z
What a time to be alive people doing videos on car companies I hope to see people excited about other car companies in the future I really hope they generate as much hype as tesla even though It most likely won&#39;t happen. Other car manufactures pay attention.
My BMW X5 has a seven seater option and the seats back there are just as crammed as the model y. It’s good for when carpooling with kids or something.
Should like model 3 max .
Your videos are always high quality with amazing editing
Ehh
Most 3rd row suv are crammed seats .
Berore y launching = S3X.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=413">6:53</a> when you know that you gonna have that beast for free.
I see no brake calipers on this unit
You know what, the design is kinda growing on me. I like that it is a bit higher than the 3. Also love that the chrome is gone haha
This video is way better then the what&#39;s inside video theres was terrible
I love Tesla and I was so wanting the model y so bad then I saw a model 3 that ate to many Big Macs lol you can have the hot super model 3 or you can buy the fat lady Y who will treat you right but just doesn’t hold a candle to the 3. But fat ladies need love too so nothing wrong with buying it but who wants to pay 10% more for 10% more fat and 10% less performance. Please buy it if 10% is all you need buy you will be surprised how I fit 3 adults 2 children and 2 weeks of luggage bedding and Christmas presents on just under 1000 mile trip. If you need more than that then damn maybe you need an RV lol. Killers me when the model 3 storage is rated with seats up and the Y is rated with seats down, very deceptive you put Y seats up you have 10% more storage than model 3.
just imagine if it had falcon doors. most purchased Tesla car
Waiting for model z
You see that jerk on the bike at? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=307">5:07</a><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fu#$!ng tree hugger!
On the video it&#39;s basically Indistinguishable from Model 3.
I’m thinking of selling one of my Hellcats for the Model Y performance!!!
looks like VW bug but better haha
Shakey
It looks like model 3
Is it true the model Y has no falcon wing doors
Damn it!! I loved the chrome why did they remove it?
S3XY EL0N MUSK
Elon finally got his &quot;Sexy&quot; line up. But personally, I think it would be &quot;Ugly&quot;. Teslas look like hot sh!t, and im sure im not the only one who thinks that. This Model Y looks like the sh!itiest tesla yet. It looks like someone gave a Model 3 a big ass, and  called it a day. Elon almost LOST HIS COMPANY because of his own foolishness, and I hate that man and his company.
it’s not a suv it’s a hatchback
I didn’t know that there is a Tesla model Y
anyone else think this was a PVP video 😂
We need more vlogs
S3XY
I didn&#39;t know the Y was even out yet, amazing!
Eggshell / Stain instead of chrome is super cool 👍🏽
SEXY ???? line cool     <br>Made the E a 3 👍🏽💣
Yes, the roadster is sick but the steering wheel 🤢
The Model S is the only Tesla that appeals to me visually.
It’s not a SUV, it’s a hatchback 🤨
MODEL <i>S</i> <i>3</i> <i>X</i> is enough for me
<i>you are a big fan of elon like me bruuhhh</i>
Hi everyone,this is my referral code. It can be used as a discount wen you purchase a Tesla: adriano84530
i buy correla better<br>and by kfc
i buy a lot car thiis is very bad
bad car bad very bad i dont like it because its cheap
it doesnt look like a SUV...looks like a big car that acts like a station wagon
How was the back seat on the model Y. I hate the model 3 back seat. only good for two people. even 2 children and a skinny adult is so so uncomfortable. No grab handles above the window either which makes it even more uncomfortable and crushing in turns.Hope the Model Y is wider with grab handles above windows
That fat X back : 🤢
Yo marquee you almost have more views than the actual Tesla channel , keep doing ya thing bro !
S3XY 😎
go to Tesla website, there is no $39,000 Model Y to be purchased.  Elon always over-promises and under-delivers.
I love the Model Y.. It looks like the hatchback Prius!! :D
But a 40W incandecent lightbulb is illegal because it destroys the environment.
Thank god the Tesla UI has a dark mode.
Awesome!  NO MORE shiny pieces !!
hi
Looks like a BMW X6. Blah!
&quot;S3XY&quot; that&#39;s SEXY
The S is the only good looking car they have made. The rest are marginal at best.
Hi Marques, having driven the model Y, would you say that it is about the same size as a compact SUV (like Mercedes GLC coupe) or closer in size to a Lexus UX ?
That&#39;s a weird looking smartphone.
Future Tesla Models...<br>Model A<br>Model F<br><br><br>Which spells - &quot;S3XY-AF&quot;
I thought you were gonna play pick it up at the start lol
I feel like the headlight should be different, it look way too much like a model 3

JESUS LOVES YOU MARQUES AND LIKE THE VIDEOS
That is a pretty sweet looking car. Really digging what Tesla is doing. This is the only car/tech company I really, really want to see succeed. EV is the future. I can&#39;t wait to live in a world where more people are driving on electricity than fossil fuels. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s taken so long, but I&#39;m glad the paradigm is finally starting to shift.
Im not a car person at all but man that roadster is insane like nothing Ive ever seen
Hey. Whats inside the tesla?
None of it means anything for this model or any other model if they cannot get their financial house in order and they are seemingly incapable of doing that.  One of the worst first quarter results in recent memory.  Losing $702M in a quarter is way bigger than even Tesla could have anticipated.
So I guess the reneged on the falcon doors. Elon mentioneda while ago that the model y will have falcon doors
My impressions and assumptions about the Model Y too Marques. The Y looks like a perfectly executed  blend of the best of the 3 and X. I think it will skyrocket in sales eventually surpassing all other Tesla models.
A Model 3 violently and spontaneously erupted in a massive explosion yesterday.  Fortunately no one was within the 50 ft blast zone.  It was caught on surveillance video in an all concrete parking garage.  Any family inside, or out, would have been instantly incenerated, and a residential home would have been leveled and burned to the ground.  Lithium is INSANELY dangerous and should be outlawed for use in  cars.  <br><br>Every RC flying field sees this 5 times a weekend, and every club has lost a house or three to uncontrollable Lithium fires.  This isn&#39;t a joke folks, RC flying fields have have STRICT safety polies about storing Litium batteries in commercial fire bags inside ammo boxes specifically designed to with stand massive spontaneous explosions.  And these brick-size batteries still do a ton of damage, regularly.<br><br>You have no idea what you are dealing with.  We are trying to keep your kids alive here, you are too irresponsible to save.
When can they make something massive like Toyota sienna or Honda Odyssey?
He protecc <br>He atacc <br>But most importantly <br><br><br><br>He’s a Niccer

Why are people buying stocks in a company that hasn&#39;t made a profit and might even have to file for bankruptcy by August of this year?
This is my first time actually viewing a Tesla car, I didn&#39;t realise they looked so nice

Fire but the 7 seat option isn&#39;t available til 2020 for some strange REASON!!
no such thing as impresx or not
Model 3: I&#39;m pregnant!<br>Model X: How the baby will looks like?<br>Model y: <b>appears</b>
S3XY = Sexy :)
Slightly larger then a regular car is not doing it for me.  I wish it was shaped like the Huyndai Tucson.  I&#39;m actually looking into buying the Kona.
Why don’t you talk about drones as well
Tesla&#39;s next 4 vehicles, B.A.C.K.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=40">0:40</a> does that mean sexy
So it&#39;s s3xy then with the roadster s3xyr and finally the semi truck s3xyst 😂😂
What&#39;s with the dropping of articles? &quot;The&quot; model y
I saw you in Kearny NJ in your S I waved but you didn&#39;t see me...
Because if there was no model Y it would just be S3X which would not be good for Tesla’s reputation
Really can&#39;t buy into that dash. :/
find yourself someone who describes you like MKBHD describes cars 😂😂
I can&#39;t stop thinking about this EV!
it should&#39;ve had higher ground clearance and utility to compete with small mainstream SUVs.
Model Y for YUCK
Ein geniales Auto
What? NO FALCON WING DOORS?
The Model Y should&#39;ve been a 4 seater convertible
I wouldn&#39;t call it hatchback. Will not consider it at all since it has no space for my dog. WAITING FOR FORD EV
Maybe it is a hybrid
Tesla almost the same as 🍏.
Who says America can’t make cars people want?
Clever strategy from Tesla.<br><br>A new model with less cost in research and developement if we compare with all the previous cars.
Its a model 3 with a different roof.
Anybody have a picture with the Hatch open . It seems to be some kind of state secret.
Who else noticed Elon wearing Nike shoes
Is this gonna be flexfuel?
You should make more Tesla videos. Reviews, software updates, whatever. That would be dope
This Is easily my least favorite Tesla as far as the silhouette/style goes.  Looks more soulless than the rest of the line up which Is saying something.
This thing is sweet. They are going to sell a boatload of these.
Why blaspheme Jesus name to talk about a car?
Second Apple is Getting ready

I hope they come out with a hot hatch one day
&quot;Pretty modest without the performance pack&quot;. From an european&#39;s point of view, that is one hella fast 0-60 speed :D
What song is it in the beginning
Great overview, very well done, as one would expect, Marques.  Did you see that bird?!  ; )
Wait what, you were filming on a 1DX? I thought it was just the front facing camera of whatever phone you had with you XD
I&#39;m definitely interested in one of these. It looks like a good design and small SUVs are nice especially in a city.
seattle sockeye!! les go!!
All of Tesla is ugly, simple.

Looks consusted at 3 rd row🙄🙄
Mark ass brownie
Can someone who disliked this video tell me why? I don’t see how you could
Not everyone is into &quot;chrome delete&quot;.
Basically SEXY
the model 3 looked horrible during presentation, it looks a lot better here.
I will get one of these , for sure. This is exactly what I was waiting for.
Basically just a 3 with a taller roof. The slope near the back means the rear row of seats will be horrible to sit in for tall people, assuming they fit at all. Most cars with 7 seat configs have a boxier shape to ensure people aren&#39;t banging their heads off the roof. Probably the most useful feature is its a hatchback which should make it far more suitable for carrying loads especially as the seats fold flush.
I want it 😏
I want more vlogs
Vlogging from MKBHD?? Yes please!!!
Why do people not like chrome?
The front face looks like a guy that shaved his mustache

Affordable? $39k is affordable? This is a car, not an SUV. Affordable is &lt;$30k.
Great video:)
omggg its like sexy<br>S3XY = SEXY
I’m hoping that the following Tesla car lineup will include as follows:<br><br>Model B<br>Model E<br>Model A<br>Model 5<br>Model T
Not used to seeing Mkbhd shooting vlog style videos.  <br>Awesome content as always.
Love your videos you so professional and well informed and articulate too. Plus your editing is excellent. Its a pleasure to watch your stuff.
I wonder why they wouldn&#39;t let anyone open the trunks?
Anyone noticed that crooked trim line between front and rear doors?
that rear diffuser on the model Y makes and taller back makes it look so much better than model 3 rear
any thoughts of making a video about the Toyota Mirai that runs on Hydrogen? please? :D
Your right arm must be twice the size of your left.
Something you may not be considering... the 3rd row legroom looked almost non-existent during the test rides. But that is because the 2nd row was moved all the way back. According the Franz, the 2nd row can be moved fore and aft, so you give up some legroom for that row in exchange for more 3rd row legroom. The fact that the seats sit up higher than the 3 and allow for more vertical legroom should make this work pretty well.
Camping in model Y must be awesome
How can people buy a car Without exhaust?
Y? Because she’s sexy!
Where is the missing flat roof and vertical rear door which creates the additional volume and useable roof rack of an SUV?  This doesn&#39;t even look like an SUV, more like a slightly larger hatchback version of the Model 3.  The third row better be used for midgets or extremely short people, or the family pets.  The cars that traditional manufacturers are soon coming out with will be true SUVs, with room in row 3 for real-sized people or more useable cargo space; that may hurt Model Y sales, once they arrive.
Nice Sockeye shirt

Thanks for stealing the beat from SimplyPops and his boy Tommy. Thats shitty.
So now they line spells out S3XY
😂😂😂一直盯着屏幕，为什么还没出现字幕？
its really amazing what Tesla has done, to &quot;fuel&quot; the need for Electric cars by big manufacturers like Toyota and Mercedes...

Tesla has some of the greatest quality cars, but they always looks like straight ass...

What&#39;s the name of the intro song?  Google can&#39;t recognise it :(
Markass Brownlee
As much as I like it, I thought it was going to be more of a regular hatchback, bit cheaper then the rest of the fleet.
I think it would be cooler if it was different. But it&#39;s just an X with smaller proportions
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=342">5:42</a>, wow even the test car has misaligned doors.
waittt... I just realized that&#39;s why people call tesla cars s3xy... 😣
new roadster is SLEEK. It&#39;s from the future.
Thumbs up for Elon and Marques to hotbox the roadster together when it drops 🚗💨
Who else was looking at the semi in the back???
Where’s Tesla model Z
I mean the model S had an option for the 3rd row also
Don&#39;t say another thing about the new Roadster!  I had no idea the interior was awesome I cannot take it !!!  <br><br><br>The greatest things about Model 3 and Model Y are : no limits.  No limits to performance, to handling/cornering, to affordability, to range, to economy, and now, to cargo / versatility.  Tesla.  No Limits.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=216">3:36</a> isn&#39;t that the guy that cuts things in half on youtube
The chrome makes the car look more fancy and expensive. The satin black on the model Y makes the car look like it should be priced in the $20k&#39;s.
Intro song ???
no need to leak the model Y, just a bloated 3 as expected
Elon musk is genius he isn’t spending money on advertising on t.v. He is on social media and making these type of friendships or partner ships
Great Vid bro, Can;t wait to see a auto focus ep featuring Model Y
The next two models have to be A then F.... S3XY AF
Affordable...That’s crazy and price still too high in my opinion. Nice review though..
The Model Y AWD hits the sweet spot for me.  Right size, utility, range and performance for my needs.  There&#39;s a strong chance one of these could be in my future.
5.9s or 5.5s 0 to 60 is not modest, it&#39;s FAST. and 3.5s is supercar territory.
Yo look it&#39;s Mark Ass Brown Lee <br>That&#39;s hot<br>-Will Smith

Was there a Tesla Spaceman in attendance at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=124">2:04</a>?
Model barf
now everybody is going to own a Tesla
Ground clearance?  If the same as a Mosel 3, how can we call it an SUV?
Elon is kinda S3XY himself.
Question to US consumers, does many of you really liked &quot;Model Y&quot;?<br><br>Per my understanding Tesla wants to compete with SUV like Toyota Rev 4 kind of vehicles. But for me Model Y doesn&#39;t look like a SUV but bigger version of Sedan. <br>I read that it&#39;s a crossover between Sedan and SUV, does US consumer prefer crossover over SUV ? Thanks in advance.<br><br>I&#39;m from India &amp; hate gasoline cars to the core and love Chinese govt policy to promote EV at neck break speed from last few years. God Bless Tesla, Elon and China
model 3 and Y are better looking than the S and X. Front &quot;grill&quot; of the car is simple and sleek.
And it will scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7.
except it&#39;s NOT an SUV !
I just want to know how high up the seating is. I hate driving a sedan these days as everyone else drives SUVs or trucks that are difficult to see around when riding in a sedan, so I wasn&#39;t that excited about the model 3. The Model X has odd gull-wing back doors that didn&#39;t work well initially, so that put me off of them. If the Y is roughly similar to a Jeep Grand Cherokee, then I&#39;m sold, but otherwise, I&#39;ll wait for a bigger model.
sucks one has to wait 2 years for the base model.
That&#39;s a dope shirt.
Mark ass at it again !
I like it!
M3 fanboys want a sedan, so I&#39;m not sure if it will outsell the 3.  It DOES have a hatchback, something sorely missing on the 3, however.  Other issues:  blah black or white ($1200) interior only, glass roof only, center touchscreen that does not swivel, no heads-up display, and if you want safety features or a different color than black, you&#39;re gonna pay through the nose.  Meh.....
The only thing I don’t like from the mode 3 And the Y is the front bumper omg is super ugly they need to make a front like the model s
Love how comfortable Elon seemed in the presentation of the model Y
Take Flash Photo of interior...
is it really an SUV or a Hatchback model 3?
Beautiful car. Sweet electric mobility :-)<br> The price will be lower, because the batteries will be cheaper in 2021.
Small SUV 7 seater back seats are for kids. No issue then because how many people try to cram 7 adults into one car? Can imagine the space is better than a petrol car because of the length of the cabin in comparison to the overall length.
Mark Ass Brownie
That Roadster looks nice!
What is the SONG starting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=120">2:00</a> ? It&#39;s so good , please , thank you :))
I love watching mkbhd because his video resolution hides the notch on iPhone xs
Aside from the roadster, all their cars look the same, and are looking really &quot;dated&quot; -- like 2012-ish.  Even the new ones -- they need to freshen things up a bit.
Not sure what this adds after the Model X. Seems a bit useless? A small citycar or something that&#39;s more stationwagon shaped with a shitload of bootspace seemed to make more sense. But hey, I guess they know what they are doing.
Wow!!! This red sportcar is soooooo beautiful!!!!
THIS GUY IS A ASS LICKER ,,, NON GENUINE AND FAR FROM INDEPENDENT HE LIVES OF COOPERATIONS SMH 🤦‍♂️
Are you going to give me the s10 plus yes or no I just want an answer
Besides it being electric it looks underwhelming. Telsa designs suck, I can most definitely do a better job designing
I&#39;m getting sick of the camera-shaking. Sorry, ain&#39;t able to watch the video.

I have a hunch that this car is just not gonna kill it.
Wait, was the S3XY actually intentional?...
shaped like a Prius
I literally said the next model, the Model Y would be a fusion of the model x and model 3
I can dig it...
Just looks like a Model Y and X had a baby to be honest.

Ahhh thats hot, THATS HOT
When the two people from the back came out of the car, you can&#39;t help to notice 1) they are short (i.e. 5&#39;2&quot;), 2) they are Asian!, 3) they stepped up to come out of the car then immediately landed displaying about a foot or so height difference between the car and ground!<br>For the Asian remark, I guess Tesla only thinks Asians are small... Hope no one stinks it up because of some &#39;racial reasons&#39; and discrimination!
Model’s S3XY. The Tesla sexy line
S3XY == Sexy? LMAO
Am I the only one who recognized that he changed his profile name ?
Only ever seen 1 Model X in Sydney AU
Shaky cam
I kinda dislike the direction they are going with the headlights on the model 3 and Y. Model S and X have much cooler fronts imo, they are a lot meaner looking. The 2020 roadster has the coolest headlights tho! Here&#39;s hoping the next Teslas go for that look.
That’s a hell of an ugly car ! Whaaa
So far,this was the most objective video about Model Y.
Hey Marques! Your videos are amazing! How did you learn to deliver flawless amazing reviews? I&#39;m sure practice is one of the ways to become great. Do you have a pdf or any useful tools you recommend to learn how to do great YouTube/video reviews on products? Thank You!
Screen looks a lot better sideways. Spot on Tesla
Yeah but too bad they pulled Tesla vehicles off consumer reports for bad quality
Model S<br>Model 3<br>Model X <br>Model Y <br>Elon musk is a legend
You can only like this if u have every model Tesla so far
Anyone else besides me that are the 4 people who didn’t know about Model Y? 😂
Please unboxing Redmi note 7 Pro
Thanks Elon Musk for if all cars are combined, they would be named S3XY
.
I like the beat
That&#39;s a SUV come on , I love what Tesla has  done but everyone of Tesla&#39;s cars look like a similar-looking sedan , one of the reasons people love SUVs is their higher and they have lots of Headroom, this thing is too damn small. I was hoping Tesla would do something really different on this models design.
NICE TRY...
Ford may have killed Sex but ELON brough that SE3Y back! Love that guy!
I want fortnite and Marques Brownlee

Great review, love the car, now let me check my bank account and i hate it.

Damn, this Y is ugly.
I predict Hoovies Garage will buy the nations cheapest Tesla Model 3 soon 😂

Hello Parabéns belíssimo canal  ótimo vídeo 👍<br>super Saudações 🇧🇷 beijos com carinho <br>😘 Love
Tesla sucks and is the Apple of cars. Just mediocre and pandering to the fanboys who will buy anything with the logo on it. Apple fanboys will buy any crappy phone as long as it has apple on it, same with Tesla. <br><br>Realistically for the money you can get a way better car with more features and better reliability and better looking. I had high hopes for tesla back when they announced teh production of the Roadster, but then the actual production it looked like a cheap ass kit car. Then they have so many issues, same as the crap they are churning out now. Its all geared toward the trendies who dont have any concept of class, quality or anything and just buy whatever crap is &quot;trendy&quot;.
Thank you for saying that has a Hatchback! I couldn’t find that info and for me the selling point in that car!
Awesome
I cannot get over just the middle screen for everything. My boyfriend has a Model 3 and every time I drive it, I&#39;m bothered by the lack of a speedometer. it just feels so odd to have it off to the right like that.

Looks like a ford
Thank you MarkAss
S3XY. Kinda looks like sexy.
The Y is for Why?
The cars just look so plain to me. Like the lowest end jobs with a nice paint job.
This is a suv? Why not make it taller like a really suv
That is NOT an SUV. It&#39;s a hatchback.
Why 2 buy a Y? Those devices do not have the soul that you want from a Car
this is so underwhelming... they could give at least some new headlights &amp; taillights. this the tesla sandero stepway!!
Where can I get that t-shirt he is wearing?
Who gives af that 7 ppl can fit. 230 miles is a RIP off

The song in the beginning is the sample for famous dex pick it up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=168">2:48</a><br>Tbh, I thought it would cost more. Looks like I&#39;ll be getting a Tesla when I get older.
Is that random bass on purpose?
Another SUV without ground clearance. :/
Sorry Tesla, when it comes to crossovers, I think the Polestar 2 did it better.
Why didn&#39;t Tesla let anyone open the trunk/frunk? is it because this unit was just a prototype and the hatch/frunk simply did not open?
S3XY<br><br><br><br>Wow 😮
I think its actually quite ugly to be honest :| Just reminds me of the Fiat Multipla... The steep angle from hood to windscreen... ugh
Everybody’s life can suck and it’s not so much what happens but how you’re able to deal with it. LOL what the fuck Damn im high as fuck
I&#39;m critical of the Y.  I don&#39;t like that it looks like a bubble.  I prefer the top to go nearly straight back with a normal hatch.  The U in SUV stands for utility and that lacks utility.
Thank you very cool markass brownlee
Elon Musk is a genius

Hi mark ass brownlee
Stuped roadster can’t even make a full steering wheel how much is that gonna cost ?!?  The problem with Tesla is cost unless he make a car that the average person can buy for 25000ish, he’s gonna go broke.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=323">5:23</a> Marques, that&#39;s called plastic to help reduce costs probably.  Made it seem like a big deal lol
More vlogs please!
What’s the price of the 2020 roadster gonna be?
Leg room?<br><br>Ever sit in a BRZ/FRS/T86? Lmao
Tesla’s all suck I Much rather keep my 2015 McLaren 650s and Subaru Sti
Looks like a Porsche from the side!
We really out here 😂
So now Elon Musk have his all Models &quot;S 3 X Y&quot; ?
looks fantastic
Elon is a S3XY boi
What&#39;s the intro tune? It&#39;s Wicked!! 😁
When you see a karma automotive add on this video
Soon in the future they&#39;d be releasing Tesla X Nike shoes... Eco-friendly shoes. 🤯🤯
Dude the word of the day is &quot;crossover&quot;!!! . U r a nerd/geek do ur research on car lingo. Don&#39;t embarrass ur self.
Where is will Smith
The background music was spooky
Been driving around London for a year? Wtf
Ah that’s hot, that’s hot
I think I like the Jaguar I-pace better.
This car is amazing!
Broo how dis u get THIS kinda Famous?? Just beacuse of these youtube videos or there nother way??
Hey please support my page
A 7 seater? That looks so small for 7 seats feels like the back row would be extremely tight. My 2010 Honda Pilot has 3 rows and the last row is tight and that’s a pretty big car
For us who travel distances, state to state, this type of car is still not a viable option until the proper infrastructure is available everywhere.
&quot;They don&#39;t let us open the Trunk, or the Frunk&quot;.... thats&#39;s BS, how they spect to sell a car with so many unanswered questions???
Best!
Great video
Roadster footage was sick! Desert should always be at the end :)
Hi, I thought that was a nice first impression.
Ah shit...Brown Marker-ass is messing up all the new models seats.
Mark-ass Brownie
Naming your lineup S3XY when your a grown ass man is a little cringey
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=100">1:40</a> THAN, not then Marq
Your forgetting the model r for roadster and model u for utility pickup to make ru s3exy
Gotta reduce fossil fuels.
Battery version of gta vice city batista .
Elon is a genius.
MonkaS Brown
Big tesla fan here but I think that roadster looks too mainstream and boring
Sloped roof at the back is useless for both cargo and headroom!!
Why do this cars drive at 300 kph if the faster you can drive inside the city is 70
nice
What&#39;s with this Guys and Tesla? he is werid
Markass brownie
They have 1 letter left to make the futures best car
S3xy= sexy
What&#39;s not to love about Elon
It looks ugly 😏😏😏
So before the model y elon just had s3x in his line up....
Y Model Y???
Will smith: I would want fortnite and mark ass brownie
that guys predicted there&#39;s gonna be so many memes after elon was told nice shoes and yeah that guy was right lol
Mark ASS BROWNLEE
Just another fail for Tesla  what a surprise !
What about the Quirks and Features and the Dough score?
sorry but that thing looks phat! love the look of it with the white paint on dark rims, great price too
The front so ugly, the back is nice
This video is trending in Denmark that must be the first time
Tesla cars are awesome! But their design... ugh, they never get it right, so ugly, except for the unreleased Roadster.
If it&#39;s so much like a 3, I don&#39;t understand why they just don&#39;t make it now, instead of two years from now.<br><br>I know why you&#39;re excited about the Roadster; you&#39;re one of the few people who will ever drive one. <br>I&#39;m guessing, north of $100,000.
The next 4 models will be NOEL. <br>S3XY ELON.
The model Y is soo ugly.
Nice can’t wait to get my hands on one!
Is this what you wanted?
the funniest thing why they rename model e to model 3 cuz SEXY NOW IT IS S3XY 🙂
What actually defines a SUV? that looks like a Sedan to me
It’s so sexy
Dude. PLEASE put a hi-pass filter on your mic. The low end booms are KILLING my ears
So its a prius on coke
I see the sport but where&#39;s the utility?
I got to say the rear end looks significantly better sharing it with the model X than it does with the model 3. This will sell extremely well.
Why model y
Yesla t
So before model Y exists, the lineup was called S3X ?

Why are all of Tesla&#39;s cars so ugly though? Their design strategy is &quot;put great looking lights on ugly and bland bodies&quot; and I don&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t do more to differentiate themselves. Unless you see the logo you can&#39;t tell it&#39;s a tesla from a block away and for a luxury performance oriented car that&#39;s inappropriate in my opinion.
Intro music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=135">2:15</a> Elon looks like Ninja -;)

7 people. Mexicans are going to love this car
Friendly reminder that Elon Musk is a piece of shit and has  harassed former employees to get his way
good
Sexy S3XY
Tesla Model Y = Tesla Model 3 with 2 more seats<br><br>Creativity is off the charts man!
I really like the all glass panoramic roof  I wish the X was like that I would buy the Y if it was as big as the X
Impressions : bigger version of model 3.. so none basically
why does the production of this video seem so forced
I love watching you on my galaxy s9 cause when I put it in full screen on youtube to fill the screen, its already basically filled and nothing gets cut 😁
Someone get this man a SWITCHPOD pronto!!
It’s a pregnant VW Beetle!
background music?
<b>Whats the intro song?  It’s not on the Spotify playlist...</b>
2020 Time line ROADSTER Impression !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>12 months away
Actually a beautiful car for a family of 6 or 7 not gona lie it doesn&#39;t look bad at all
Looks like a gaymobile
a vehicle with no front grill looks fucking ugly to me....they look like unfinished concept cars...not to mention i wouldnt want to deal with teslas horrific customer support and service...heard nothgin but bad things about tesla as a company and service center....
looks like it ran into the back of another car
I&#39;ve never understood why a certain percentage downvotes a video, no matter what the content is... No matter its quality... No mater if it&#39;s good news, bad news or simply someone saying &quot;Hi, my name is Jeff. I&#39;m a hardworking American. Would you like to be my friend?&quot; Harmless right? Apparently someone is still going to downvote it.<br><br>There are currently 1.7k downvotes on this video. Reason? Because the thumb down button exists. That&#39;s it. They click it because it&#39;s there to be clicked.
markass brownleaf
It’s ugly af. Tesla needs to get their design department in order. I can see it being their downfall in the future once other companies finally get onto electric.
The matte black trim has me sold.
I love the design of the Y.  It&#39;s beautiful.
I’m SUBBING to anyone that likes this and SUBS to me
Non car guy reviews car ?
Eeel on musk lol
Kinda looks like a Prius
Did you just shave?🤐
Mark ass brownie
S3XY - looks like sexy! Elon is awesome
Elon musk is not done with s3xy. It’s gonna be s3xyer
Bro could you please send me your number
How this video is trending its shaking the whole time...
I’m very disappointed in the model Y. It’s not an SUV, it’s a station wagon. Really low to the ground, so you can’t really use it for off-roading like an SUV. It’s quite short with limited legroom, so you can’t put your full family in it, unlike an SUV. And you can’t really  tow with it, unlike an SUV.
Why are tech channels suddenly calling cars “tech products” and making videos on them like they know anything about cars? Keep to your phones kids 🤙🏻 also no Tesla has chrome, pretty much no modern cars have chrome. They have silver plastic, ‘chrome’ is chromium plated steel.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=280">4:40</a> i think its just him being tall
They went to a mini look
S3xy= sexy
The new model why?
👌
Mark ass brownie
I personally don’t like it.
This thing is ugly as hell.
It should have been called Model 3S Max!
Our country need this car very badly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=442">7:22</a> I fucking love Elon
Idn but something about it’s look seems a bit off, not very aesthetically pleasing. Though that Roadster looks fine as hell.
Wow you review cars now? 🤨
After YT rewind I am a little too traumatized to watch him anymore but I think I am healing.
Any news on when Tesla will allow leasing the Model 3?  I really don&#39;t want to own one after the warranty expires.
Cant wait till tesla makes a tesla airplane lol
S3XY ooo sexy
intro music kinda sounded like Pick it up by Famous Dex
is this guy flexing again..stop recommending me this shit youtube
Thanks for sharing your impression based on a very limited experience. Looking forward to seeing more soon. The model Y is good looking to me.
it&#39;s the BMW 3 series and 5 series GT (Gran turismo).
The front end of these Tesla cars look like a pair of lips there&#39;s no style there
I&#39;m just hearing about all this chrome delete stuff now... why don&#39;t people like chrome trim? Doesn&#39;t it make the car look a lot fancier/cooler?
Wish i had the money to buy a car..... think they should do a bike as well
Dope👍🏿
Red and black! An obvious nod to a special someone in the crowd ❤️
BUT.. Does it have butterfly doors?🤔🤔
This is like the iPhone XR compared to the iPhone X
Mazda 3
Mad ugly
The new Model 3X.
Is that a Tesla and Porsche collaboration? ;-)
Looks exactly the same like all of their previous models.
It&#39;s a fricking model 3, that&#39;s not a SUV, the Kona EV is an SUV.
Suckers auto, quite mini vanish....
Model Y does not look good to me. A good looking smaller SUV is an Audi Q5 or Mercedes GLC or some RangeRover models. Only the model s lools good to me. The interiour also isn t ergonomic. A big screen for all settings is cheap and dangerous. I think there should be button for basic things like AC, Loudspeakers etc.
model S = model sedan, mind blown

Semi-S3XY roadster

Of course Elon has custom Nikes that have the Tesla T logo on the toebox
switchpod shoutout!!!
Anyone have thoughts on why the stock PLUMMITED after the announcement
I love how the official Tesla unveil video has less views than Marques’s review
As a tall person: I appreciate your legroom comments!! Thank you.
Sweet Baby Jesus 😍
another copy paste review, get a job you knob
Okay just seen one of these in Durham NC &quot;RTP&quot; saw it from the front and didn&#39;t remember the model 3 looking like that.
Every time I click a Tesla video I always get a car.
Excellent music selection across the entire video (better than usual is what I&#39;m trying to say)
Sorry, thats not an SUV, its a car.  They can say the CAR their showing is grey in color, but it&#39;s blue.
Niko, let&#39;s go bowling!
Never wanted a Tesla until now..
MKBHD spotted the “s3xy” acronym literally years ago guys, stop
stop with the click bait, your video sucks
It looks great, looking forward to one down the road.
Tesla model 3 was supposed to be called model E to complete SEXY but the company Ford rejected the idea so they changed it to 3
Too bad it doesnt come with falcon doors.
Buy a Nio, thanks
Again only central panel? <br>This is like a phone with no sdcard
Tesla&#39;s are S3XY
Same boring interior
Mark ass brown
I hate this damned company so much.  All they are is a welfare whore off the government to subsidize TERRIBLY designed cars, for the wealthy.<br><br>And they are terribly designed which is why they are so expensive.<br><br>The only reason this dumb stupid company exists, is taxpayers pay for it to exist.  Elon Musk is no damned genius, he&#39;s a conman, and there&#39;s a ton of frauds in government siphoning off the top.
Oh I thought Elon Musk would be in the comment section.
I don’t think the Model Y will sell. I know the Model Y will sell. Much better than the Model 3 to be exact.  Y? Well I’m glad you asked. Think of the Model Y as the Model 3 Max. Or iPhone X Max. Bigger will sell in the US. We need bigger cars. So why not just make the Model 3 bigger and call it the Model Y? Crossovers have hit big in the US. So it’s only right to make a slightly bigger Model 3. Tesla was smart to bring out the Y. But if they want to hit it big, they need to hit Ford where it hurts. The pickup segment. Let’s go Tesla
WOW I am number 4!
Stick to phones
All I got to say is y?
Anyone know what kind of mic is he using?
What is the song called at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=120">2:00</a>?

It&#39;s a more baby X, I love it
No speedometer.
looks ugly as shit
S3XY Roadster. It all makes sense now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=415">6:55</a> , when you enter home after a long day and you smell pizza 😂
why model y doesnt have rear side marker lamp?
Also, totally new type of Aero Wheels at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=337">5:37</a>
elon thinks his cars are s3xy
Still unaffordable for the average person.
2day is my birthday.. wishes ??
That is really S3XY
Pretty modest acceleration? Wat?
This car and the third row are clearly intended for taxi drivers. They always use SUVs for their safety standards.
why all these models got side mirrors ?
It&#39;s not an SUV tho is it 😂
Ugly as hell!
You don’t hear the words “beautiful Hawthorne” all toooo often living in Los Angeles haha
Ahhh that&#39;s hot
SUVs outsell cars?<br><br>Americans are so fucking ridiculous
Looks like the new mazda 3 hatchback
“If you need 3 rows on the regular” buy an 80,000-120,000 model x. 😂
Model S Model X Model Y What do we get?      SXY
370km in with standard. Woooweee
Why do these channels all have borders I am pretty sure It&#39;s just there for the video to look better
WHY THOUGH? PLEASE SOMEONE
Come on...Tesla... Just like iphone putting up same design into different sizes.. And this Y is worst, i can&#39;t imagine if a crash is coming from the back...just no space at all ...
I will wait for the model z
You take forever to get to the point, good lord. Save yourself the trouble and skip this to about 3 minutes in
I saw what you did there “S3XY” at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=40">0:40</a> - slick MOVE brotha!!
❤️😀💕😀
Does anyone else notice that the 4 lineups of telsa form the word sexy. S3XY
Model Y looks shorter than the Model 3
It would be SEXY if it wasn&#39;t for Ford. Fucking Ford.
The new roadster is hands down the sexiest car in existence :P

the rear of tesla&#39;s look awesome, but i hate the design of the front end, it doesnt need a grill but it just looks like a blob
Vloging is weird on Marcus
Looks like Toyota Prius Imao!
model x and y huh elon musk? I bet his next cars is going to be &quot;sword and shield&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=24">0:24</a> pfff what a fanboy copying Elon&#39;s  laugh
ground clearance on it sux
I don&#39;t mind the looks but why is everyone convinced this is crossover?  They can call it whatever they want but I do hope that at least customers can recognize this as regular hatchback.
I don&#39;t understand Tesla&#39;s boner for sunroofs.  I did a 500 mile trip in a Model 3 and the sun was beating down on me the entire time.  Pretty miserable with no shade for 500 miles.

Wait so Mark Ass BrownLee is real?
hello markass borwnley, do you want to  play fortnite with me, will smith and mathias01gamer and get this epic victory royale number 1???? 😩😩😩😩😩
Model y is easily the most ugly Tesla.
Where did mkbhd get all his money
If mama Tesla and dada Tesla had a baby
LOOKS Amazing! &lt;33 I have to buy one.
I for sure hope Tesla does the chrome delete to their future lineups, since they&#39;re also moving away from the chrome trim in their interior as well and the chrome trim just looks like an ageing style choice now.<br><br><br>(Definitely don&#39;t make it optional however)
Mark ass brownie
Speaking of S 3 X Y... who’s that getting out of the front passenger seat @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=153">2:33</a> 😍
👌🏻
I was hoping this might be my future, practical everyday driver...but, at least at the moment, looking at the design and price, it seems I&#39;ll go with an electric Kona instead.
NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING!!!
Its ugly
Looks like a big Toyota Prius.
Will Smith: That’s hot
nice vid man. great to hear your take on it!
BTW, have you guys seen the resale value for model S? 50% off after 5 years.
Christian von Koenigsegg and Elon Musk should collab
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQri1NdscR4&amp;t=193">3:13</a> watching the launch event online i only counted 6 adults who probably stayed seated in the front and middle rows. But sure 7 seats, which is optional. 2 far back there for children I imagine. Did anyone else see 7 people exit the car? Would be fantastic though
Model s<br>Model 3<br>Model x<br>Model y<br> = s3exy LMAO😂😂
COOL CARE WOW DEATH
I’m not so sure it’ll have the same off road capability as a Subaru Forester or Crosstrek... and those cost a whole lot less
Hhahaha in Europa ist the price off model 3 50k€ end the model y are starting 55k€ for normally people ist not Possible to buy a electric car for this money lot of people buying a normal car because with the other money you can buy so many gas for driving......in Croatia 🇭🇷 do you haveRimac the is a super sport ecar ...
Teslas designs are becoming too boring for me, if any great car company comes out with an amazing design that really works, I bet u Tesla will be in trouble, they should be making off road cars by now, I thought the model y will be a step notch of all the other models,but wen I saw it huuuuh I was bored.
Good
Tesla model x and model 3 had a child
For those who’d rather “ride” than drive.
This guy knows a lot about technology, does he have a degree in physics or something?
It&#39;s basically a Model 3 hatchback. But I&#39;d still buy it 😅
