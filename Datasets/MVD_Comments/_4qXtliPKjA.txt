This pretty funny for someone using iMovie and some random clips

It&#39;s never ogre
When its ogre<br>ITS OGRE
Fake sherek horror
Dude you fucking predicted it! Shrek 5 (&quot;Untitled Shrek Reboot&quot;) dated to release in 2019 (but there are some delays maybe?)
Jokes on you, there is actually a Shrek 5 coming in the future.
Onions have layer ogres have <b>layers</b>
I’m waiting for the real Shrek 5 trailer! I’m waiting for the memes that come with it
I really hope they don&#39;t change how Shrek looks like for Shrek 5, I swear if they make him bright grass green I&#39;ll be disappointed
The like and dislike count: <b>Balanced, like all things should be.</b>
Sad satan song?
Shrek 5 is actually coming with no plot xD
This was made with imovie

There is really a shrek 5 coming so you probably should be expecting it
Shrek 5 will actually be a prequel to the 1st shrek, so we will know the origins of shrek and how we got to the moment when shrek opens the toilet door to all star!
IMovie...
