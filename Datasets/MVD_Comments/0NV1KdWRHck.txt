It&#39;s 6 years, He is still the same gem he was then.
My personal opinion of his eloquent articulation is that it is his memory which transcends beyond his spontaneity of thought.

Genius man in the world so lovely man and golden heart 💕❤@srk
Great Respect for you, your life is inspirational, proud of you Sir
Is he using a teleprompter of some sort?
One of the best Ted talks I ever heard....He talks so gracefully and you will enjoy each and every moment.
Love isn&#39;t saleable
Great Dr UAK
November 20th, 2023<br>He&#39;s such a cool person!! Can&#39;t wait to watch this interview
Now I need Abhishek Bachchan to do a TedTalks as well. I love his speeches.
Look at this guy where gave him fame and money than he blames back that country and loves to go pakistan 😂 everyday supporting Pakistani societies launching actor and actresses from Karachi and Islamabad than making such movies like raees to encourage people become criminal all Pakistan politics in blood of these people 🙏🏽☠️
Proud of sarukhan ❤
Nice speaking love ❤
Self made star ❤❤❤
He is loved more for his common man&#39;s qualities than his acting. Love for his acting is just a manifestation of him being human coupled with his witty, charming and make it believe intelligent persona. ....... and that&#39;s what a man should be in order to be the most appealing one of his time  !
❤❤
Love ❤and only love to the best lover of the WORLD. &quot;&quot;SRK&quot;&quot;@srk

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This proves that SRK is also a stand-up comedian. There&#39;s nothing that this man cannot do!!
How could TED talkers talk so fluently?  Is there any prompter in front?
watching this for the 50th time
Mind blowing Talk.  I  am not in love with you but from the movies I have seen of you, and as you said, I do agree,  you are THE WORLD&#39;S BEST LOVER. You might laugh at this but I have always dreamed of doing the Waltz with you   ❤
the fact that he can make light of such a dire and harrowing experience such as his father&#39;s death in order to explain things about humanity is a testament to how well spoken and intellectual SRK is. What a man.
SRK❤
it literally looks like he is reading from a prewritten script  , nothing&#39;s natural bro
The amount of andhbhakts and boycott gang literacy put together Shah rukh spoke it in first two minutes
My goodness. Beaten to youthfulness again
Biggest inspiration SRK<br>Loving compassion 💓
Apakah hanya Shahrukh Khan aktor yang bisa berkata kata seperti itu
gutkha guy, fairness cream, liquor seller
Today I&#39;ve seen a very different, far from the bollywood, a nervous speaker tried to make the audience believe that he is a good speaker....              <br>Respect SRK.  🖤
Mere kuch smj nhi aaya , but sunke bhut acha lga, Proud on SRK❤
More Witty u r, More love to u.
Thats why I am his fan ❤
Im very lucky to witness his era ❤
The last of Stars! THE SHARUKH KHAN♥️
Salute to this man for representing India on a global platform, Salute to this man for giving us such masterpiece movies like Swadesh ,Devdas,veerjara,kal ho na ho,Jawan,Darr and etc etc.Salute to this man for  teaching us how to love ,how to express,how we can do something for our countries betterment,Salute Shahrukh ......❤️❤️❤️
What A Man!!!
I love listening to him.  His voice has an effect on you somehow, at least it does on me.  He&#39;s charming, humble, and very very polite.  He actually cares about how you are.
Greatest star of Bollywood to learn lots of life lessons
I am 21 and still i got nothing from this talk, i tried my best to understand as much i can but still got nothing but after seeing comment section i realized that there is something that I&#39;m not able toh catch, is there any one toh help me out in simple way. Yeah i know you may think I&#39;m stupid but i don&#39;t think so cause i am still trying 😌
I love SRK❤
❤❤❤❤
I love You So Much Sir❤😊
Besides everything it is really unimaginable that no actor/actress comes in TED talk to gives their opinion because they all are believe in just showbiz but Actor like Shahrukh Khan are very few. &quot;Salute and heartily standing ovation to him&quot; ❤ <br>Proud of India 🇮🇳
He is among  the greatest people our country has !!! ❤🎉 Huge respect sir!!
What is the name of the poem he recited?
Amazing...how flowlessly he delivered his speech, no one can match his ability to create positive atmosphere in the stage and in the mind of listeners. May  God bless.
He&#39;s Awesome
I so love him. Big brother ❤😅
Love you Sir
My heart swells with pride after reading the comments...How people all over the world is showering their love for him...My all time favorite Shahrukh Khan...I just hope that people in India understood him and his ideologies a little bit more...and stop trolling him...he isnt just a bollywood star but an amazing human being...❤
Yes women want to know what a man is about and what he thinks snd feels to improve relationship. I am not looking to have 10 dates before i find out what i want. Women dont feel privileged because i work extremely hard physically emotionally mentally financially to make it work but its good to know men have their challenges too like keeping their pants on in front of a beautiful woman 😅😂
It amazes me that how effortlessly he can speak in a language that is not his native language. He is not just speaking but he is doing so with perfect voice modulation, pauses etc. And its not a five minute speech its a 17 minute long speech which has verses in Hindi. To remember all that and to articulate it in such an elegant manner takes some doing. he is an excellent speaker and industry(bollywood/Hollywood)  can utilise him in a much better manner. Forgive me for my ignorance if I have made a big deal out of this speech. I am truly amazed and inspired by this man’s seemingly effortless style of speaking.
Sharu khan❤❤❤
I loved the TED talk! He began very enthusiastically but SRK would be better if he had been himself rather than reciting a script. Honestly he is more witty than that❤
anyone knows the name of the poem ? . thx!
I have seen anyone praise India like he did
Damn how did he mug up such a long speech with great vocabulary!<br>No doubt he is witty and smart and hardworking and one of a kind !! SRK ❤
Apart from being a actor, He is intelligent, educated, wise with a great sense of humour.
hes so cool
Im not his fan, not at all<br>But believe me, God Made him differently:)❤<br>His astrological chart tells everything, totally self-made guy
IDK why these senseless MFs are laughing.., while he is telling about the moment he lost everything?<br><br>Whatever...., I&#39;ve heard about TED talk, where listeners are said to be educated people , but here it is totally opposite,<br><br>Those who laughed at him on that day, will suffer the same..., and then lemme see whether they laugh or not.<br><br>Senseless stupid waste of society. 🤨😡
He is the biggest superstar across in Bharat and so  he is the easy target who targeting, become famous, to come on limelight 😂😂, nothing else. Don&#39;t mi d my english just feel
This man is perfect representation of our country &amp; culture!! ❤
Love him❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Anyone here after his Jawan Movie?
Who is here after jawan
i waas 5 year old when i watched his movie chahat in lakshmi nagar Delhi Radhoo palace.
Wow. I&#39;m stunned. Never underestimate a person (you do not know)! Thx for the speech.
💗💗💗💗
He deserves Bharat Ratna.❤
Why would you even bring an actor to talk about humanity? It doesn&#39;t matter how &quot;well put together&quot; actors appear in public. Behind closed doors they&#39;re rapists, pedophiles, narcissists or straight up psychopaths. The film industry only sells a dream. It&#39;s a trap set by cruel terrorists. The film industry is run by evil individuals. Bring real people with real life experiences.
Now I understand why he and Priyanka fell in love. They&#39;re simply so perfect for each other
bhai bina driving sikhe koi kuch nhi chala sakta. bc kucch bhi kahani bata ke suna rha h. ...actor h bc to har jagah acting krega...chutiye log ise bhagwan samajte h...
I can watch him on loop ❤
❤SRK❤
i always admire his speech... he is a living GEM....Love from Kuwait....
The legend of cinema srk<br>And power of srk fans
I am Waiting for jawan movie
The ultimate King
Just a awrsome speech
I never knew SRK is such a deep thinker, prolific speaker and highly intelligent. His vocabulary commands is exceptional. If he is not simply an actor, he could easily be an academic or an orator. Proud of my all time fav Hollywood actor. An Australian here.
🕺🧕ccD☔
❤❤
Well articulated and an excellent talk ❤ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=40">0:40</a>
One needs to listen to this a few times to get the complete essence of it. So deep. So wise. Shshrukh Khan is the most eloquent speaker ever.
First video commented on ❤✨
Thank you so much for your feedback.<br>We are working extremely hard to solve the problems of the students.<br>Your feedback is important for us.
His humour is just flying over the audiences head
he stole my 17 minutes
learn from him how to be when the crowd doesn&#39;t quite follow along the act
Greatest lesson you can learn from SRK: Preach after being rich or sucessful.<br>True words.
SRK&#39;s new movie JAWAN releasing on 7th September. If you manage to find some time please watch.<br>- a request from srk fan🙏❤️
Srk❤
I am here to hear to speak ....he is a speaker..the best in india
Thank You Sir for being there ❤
Great respect for our Bollywood King 👑 <br>I can feel the biasedness in that room for him. He really did it excellently while getting cold shoulder from everyone..
King 👑❤️
Such a down to earth man he is... With his generosity and simplicity he makes you feel that everything  is possible...
If not actor.... He can be a great Stand up comedian
amazing! most of the time i was searching google for new words <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ygF1XpGUMMjk8gSDrI2wCx"></a> adolescence <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/HvgfY93GEYmqvwLUuYDwAQ"></a>
India proud of you<br>SRK💚
This is a Punjabi Muslim.
💙
Wow.... Sharing words of Wisdom with so much Humility ❤<br>Love moves the World!
Lifelong appreciation to SRK
I was never a fan of SRK. Aamir remains my favourite. But as I&#39;ve grown older, I have now come to admire SRK. His wit is incomparable👍<br>I&#39;m glad he quoted from Kabir who&#39;s also my favourite poet.
He&#39;s a blend of acting, humanity, character, religion &amp; love ❤
With Shahrukh even Ted Talks become Standup Comedy
proud of india
SRk Pride of India
SRK you make us proud everywhere you go everything you do thank you so much
His degree in mass communication has done a world of good for him
Kuch samajh aaye to m bhi hsu 😁
Srk sir your thoughts are nice and your way of communication is excellent
Yes definitely love is one thing that you should speak about and mankind... After spreading kesar guttka and pan ads... Something done to your kids hurts and then remember love and compassion for the mankind... While others suffer with cancer by your ads doesn&#39;t hurts... As you are earning by spreading pan gutka ads some other earning by making your sons videos... It&#39;s just a karma of what you did....
SRK🤌🏻🤲🏻
Hate him, enemy him but you cannot ignore him. But I think he&#39;s the perfect example of India and its culture. Greatest actor and human ever for the mankind.❤
Best speech ever. Reviving the sense of humanity and its life and real power of continuity. &quot;Love&quot; a chakra you start with and end at
Amazing soul❤ god&#39;s man
I&#39;m impressed ❤😊
SRK is the best actor👑♥️
How long would it take to mug up this entire speech?
Since childhood...and say by day I fallen into immense love with this guy❤❤❤....love you sir 😊
pehle vimal bechna band karo,cancer promote karna band karo....fir yeh backchodi karna
Love is nothing<br>Work is everything.......❤❤
He is so intellectually articulated I don’t know if this is scripted by srk is witty
I love you, Shah Rukh Khan.❤
🔥
Not only me but the whole world loves SRK
SRK is SRK his thoughts &amp; feelings coinside with the BUDDHA 👍 LONG LIVE SRK.
World&#39;s Biggest Super STAR ❤ SRK
Ted!
❤
Pride of india ❤
Me at my speech to get 5 marks in 10th grade:-
❤
👑
&quot;Seems a bit careless of me now&quot;  how can he make the harsh reality into comedy.... Immense sence of humour, he is really well spoken
He is a gem.
I am grateful that I found SRK and all Indian films. Much love to north and south India. Jai Hind.
I’m new to Bollywood but if you haven’t seen SRK films, you are missing out big time. He’s got a few stinkers here and there like everyone but his best movies are incredible films. There is a reason he is the biggest movie star in the world outside of the West.

He is a badshah not only to the Films and movies he has made… he is an epitome of success, a man who knew how to survive. I love n admire sharuk for the man he is, his humbled nature and his shy persona… a down to earth man, who is succeed and still stays where he is… now his movies work or not, i will always remember the ddlj star I saw and grew up watching. Yet to know and come across a man of this nature..<br><br>He deserves a standing ovation every single day 😊

Im so so proud of myself to be his fan..I mean just look at him. What a true gentleman he is, blessed with wisdom and wittiness. I have seen many people criticising my choice to love him as an actor, but I never gave a damn back then during my childhood,  nor will I now.<br>I have huge respect and immense love for him.<br>His movies made me realize what love could be.<br>A self made man, a great actor, an amazing family man, a wonderful speaker and the list goes on and on.<br>My only desire is to meet or atleast see him once in person 😊.<br>God bless you SRK ❤.

Sorry Mr SRK I would like a Harley Davidson drive before my Ted talk<br><br>Hugh Jackman ❤
He is citing his pain and people are laughing, I would say son be happy wherever you are. 😊
I have never seen SRK movies. But I respect him as a speaker who could use the language, English and Hindi so fluently, humerously and convey his ideas and thoughts from his heart.
All he did here to talk about how big is he 😂
Lines well remembered, all in one take! Truly a great actor 😊 But yes, definitely tries to be a good person.
Heart winning session ❤
The way he conveyed his message of love and compassion is way ahead of time. He compared his life experience and humanity. How it became from simple to complex. Whoever wrote his speech did really great job. ❤❤❤❤❤. Keep Shining and sharing love 💕

TED talks: ted ko india mein popular banane ke liye bakchodi karni hain...........international fame milega.....<br><br>SRK: yes yes zaroooor<br><br>Most of the crowd was absolutely silent....This talk had no effect on anyone
My life is similar to you at the age of my early 20&#39;s. Hope i end up like you in future❤
❤
Whattt a Starrr What a Person SHAH RUKH KHAN !!!
The way he is speaking English, it seems to me that he is an experienced English professor who has stored innumerable number of uncommon words in his brain throughout his life and now using them in front of his disciples just to teach them properly.
There are two types of people in the world, those who like Sharukh Khan and those who lie and say they don&#39;t like him.
His wit ❤
Be onest motivation spike it not talented or self knowledge fat is deep soul journey to understand life living staly not oll abut why you have journey is discipline of self knowledge understand on identity destiny truth self dharma share value quality principles for oll love but unconditional since ti served so really good attitude following on self respect self love self discipline belence limits then can you motivation ir move parsonal value quality principles of light before should be know live life staly dharma direction wisdom of light
Amazing speech Sharukh ❤️❤️🙏🙏
Mla English nhi samjt tari aplya srk sati purn video bgitla. lu srk
The great actor is a great philosopher too
The Greatest Of All Time
I learn alot of things from Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s all the interviews and speeches , help to stay motivated and be kind. Wisest man with the great humour. Love and only love for SRK ❤️
He acknowledged he is a Muslim but yet he is using Hindu philosophy <br>A clear example that Hinduism is indeed a way of life <br>WHAT A GUY <br>INDIANS ARE WELCOME IN ANY PART OF THIS WORLD <br>👏👏👏👏👏👏
Kumar had created lies like that make me insecure n weak ... That I&#39;m carrying through my life ...
Sorry Sharukh ji I&#39;m older than you So no need you to feel bad ... Sorry sorry... I just suport his innocence that&#39;s it i didn&#39;t insult age i just forget your dance ... My last movie was chammaku challo i think ... Sorry x ji...
Then agree with me that only blessings n promises are true others things are lies in the Bible n other books ... That&#39;s why I left reading holy books ...
If ever there was an extempore Indian speaker (with the added skillset of being a consummate actor!) to hold an audience&#39;s attention and lead its ideology to a Godly value, it is none other than the King of Love, SRK.
Dear Sharukh Khan,<br><br>I would like to take a moment to express my admiration for you as a person and as a great Indian. Your thoughts on humanity, fame, and love are truly inspiring and reflect your wisdom and compassion.<br><br>Your words have the power to touch hearts and minds, and your actions have brought joy and hope to millions around the world. Your commitment to making a positive difference in society is a testament to your generous spirit and your dedication to making the world a better place.<br><br>Your achievements and contributions are a source of inspiration for generations to come.<br><br>Thank you for being a shining example of what it means to be a good human being and a proud Indian. May your light continue to shine and inspire many more.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Aidid
really srk is gem of india .<br>sorry let me correct he is gem of the whole world.

He is a good person i dont no why indian hate him as a Muslim 😢

Samajh nhi aaya par sun ke accha laga 😅😅<br>Love to baadshah of bollywood :- Shahrukh khan ♥️♥️♥️
Did he write this himself? He is a fantabulous orator. His body language is remarkable!!!
Perfect person to represent our country globally ❣️
You&#39;re a great soul filled with love. Thanks for spreading joy and wisdom.
He is a gud speaker
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sue Stowers: Great speech full of admiration!
Perfect person to represent India, unlike goofballs like ranveer singh etc.
He is no doubt an exceptional orator, as we all know. But if he has written the whole lecture all by himself, then must be considered among the super brilliant men in history.
❤
bahar nikal kar itna gyan pel rhe ho saheb....but india me muslims ke against atrocities hoti hai to muh me dahi jama rehta hai
I would prefer listening to jordan peterson or Ken robinson
I&#39;m  seeing in 2023 but his each words truly unbelievable  uncompareble   he is gem of indian cinema 😍🙏🏼
A real ambassador of humanity with grace ...
Teach

Amazing! Truly 👌🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Being a genuine ted talk viewer.. this is one of awakening ted talk I have ever seen!! Huge bow to him!
He will always be the most beloved personality in India. Shah Rukh Khan is the true face of India, he is an icon, he is the legend that we will always be heard of.
SRK 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😘
Love you SRK, well said!
🌺🌺🌺👏👏👏💪💪💪😘🇺🇸🇦🇫
Now a days real scholars sit at the back of the auditorium, and the hypocrate, little educated and good looking people became the teacher of countries and the world. Shame to all of us, allowing them to come so far.
This man is my everything. This man is my Utopian Utopia. And I will believe so till the last breath.
I hate you.. You are a Muslim.. So your should told assalamualaikum.
typical white audience. unappreciative. dumb even.
OMG this man is awesome ♥
fake stories.
when he started the hindi i got goosebumbs
What a speech and what a way to speech...talented beyond words 👏 👏 👏
Amazing as always!!!!
Definitely the king of love ❤️
Lovely ❤😂
❤️❤️❤️
SRK is great personality but not greater than the Nation, India
Bharat se hai bc ❤️
srk words like a poem
His oratory skills also made him an international star something what likes of Salman/Aamir lack, the Only Indian Movie star i love to listen, very knowledgeable with wits and humors in between
whole speech feels scripted
The listeners are very bad.
See his vocabulary, wisdom &amp; depth of thought ❤️
I, being a muslim and so are you expected to open your salutation with Islamic way by uttering &quot;Assalamu alaiqum&quot;. Then, you could throw other ways of salutations like &quot;Namaskar/Adab&quot; in Hindi or &quot;Good evening&quot; in English. Dear Shah Rukh, your sky-high fame as a film actor has made you blind about Islam. I understand, maybe, you were afraid that your lslam-loving attitude might hinder your journey towards being present-day Shah Rukh Khan. please keep in mind Hindus or Christians alone are not your fans; Muslims love you, watch your movies, take pride in you as well.
Despite a SuperStar he is Nations Top 5 best Speaker &amp; communicator.

So well educated Guy SRK.<br><br><br>No wonders that&#39;s why he is so loved by the whole world.
this man has my whole respect and love
Amazing stuff
Srk&#39;s english is fabulous.
Your acting, philosophy, attitude, etc <br>I like very much   you are really great sir

Love you SRK ❤️🥰
SRK is the biggest Motivation for many people...

Shahrukh Khan is a great speaker

I relate to the perspective of Freedom with the Speaker
Inspirational
Love you srk 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
The only sir I respect after my family ❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Wow... srk.. i love your thoughts...🌝🤍
What a beautiful spokesperson
No words are sufficient to explain the thoughts that have emerged from your speech sir
❤️❤️❤️
how can people laugh while he taking about his fathers last hours
KIng Khan
🙏🙏❤👌👌 From  R.V.RajithapriyaAryankhan.
THANKYOU..
It&#39;s so disheartening to see few people of his own country calls him a terrorist/anti-indian/anti-nationalist inspite of doing everything throughout the years for his countrymen aka indians. Khan Sahab doesn&#39;t give a damn about those few negative people and he doesn&#39;t need to prove over n over again that he is a true indian; in fact he&#39;s the biggest &quot;deshbhakt&quot; of india♥️♥️♥️
He is representing our India&#39;s spirituality over the materialistic world.
Why are these crazy people laughing at his emotional stories 🙄 wtf whats wrong with ths creepy audience 🤔 This is seriously cringe 😳 feeling bad for him 😏 3 mins into this vdo and I&#39;m out 😈
Incredible speech SRK sir.. i went speechless after seeing this..
He is not an actor he is an emotion
Only srk is carrying bollywood.
SRK..the name is enough..we love you srk❤️💕👑👑
Just Wow ❤
SRK😊
Great fan of You Sir♥️
Such a very inspiring
me be the this all world kows you did u r allah knows you.
One of a kind. You can&#39;t help  but love him❤❤❤
shah rukh khan is definitely an intelligent, wise human being..amazing speech 👏
WTF. People are laughing at jokes of his fathers death but not at &quot;apple was still then just a fruit&quot;.. that is truly tragic..
What are his thoughts on promoting racism and classism by doing commercials for skin whitening cream ?
Worth reflecting   ...🙍‍♂️
how humorous he is!
Love you SRK from Sri Lanka 😍

I find this guy so fuckin over rated. He thinks he&#39;s funny and very intelligent. He&#39;s a terrible actor unlike Naseeruddin and Irrfan
And that&#39;s our SRK❤️😘
Acche accho ko palle nhi pda hoga ...
Omg! I am simply in awe of this man every time I hear him speak. This man is truly a legend literally. He is single-handedly teaching the world the language of kindness and love. Every time I am sad about something I&#39;ll just turn to him and his wise words show me the right path and am back in the spirit. He is a source of joy, wit, love, kindness, grace and all things goodness.
As a little kid growing up in somaliland I’ve always loved and still do all Indian movies, actors and actresses thank you king SRK we love you
Definitely sad for those that haven&#39;t seen you work SRK 🙃
💖💗💝
Thank you so much Boss🙏❤
So simple to understand but sadly  too hard to be obtainable. Wonderful, wise words from a truly humble man.
Srk. ur real hero always aking
Bekar ka Ad krta hai aur humanity ki baat kr raha hai.
The best actor in the world
Love this guy every time, the eloquence, the humor, the wisdom is just amazing, all time superstar.
I repeat no other actor in India, has been the king of words as he is❤
Man is  a great thinker with such a genius mind. More than just an actor!!! Thanks for representing India in front of the world
Global icon Shah Rukh khan (SRK)
Once in an interview he said &quot;he is the last of the stars&quot; he really mean it <br>The country will never produce a star like this man ❤️
😍😍😍
GLOBAL SUPERSTAR SHAHRUKH KHAN 🫡
I don&#39;t know about Acting or creativity but hats off to u sir ,Srk such a wonderful speaker...🔥🔥🔥🙏
Intolerant puppet..... Funding the enemy country
What an Orator! SRK 🎉
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=780">13:00</a> that mystic poet name is Kabir das
SRK thank you for this talk. I have learned and it has helped me alot in my thoughts :)
LEGEND
I still somehow feels that he’s one of the most underrated actor in the world
his humour
LEGEND
♥️
Global superstar SRK 💚
Sir you should have to leave the bollywood industry, join the Hollywood 🔥
HUMANITY
💙
The man... 😍❤️<br>We love you shah rukh khan ❤️
Listening it in my college for some English lab activities
Great inspirational speech by one of the greatest actors❤
In regards of who you&#39;re going to accept into your own personal life; you need to develop the skill to know when to build bridges and when to build walls... Both things exist for a reson, because time machines don&#39;t...
Awesome! The marriage of wit and depth.
👏
Que @ hub
Discarded + Discriminating
Super star in the world.... love you
His English is like a music which feels so bleesed to my ears!
King Khan.
SRK
Wow yes survival is tough for some was for me. And those that speak of humanity should practice it too.this guy is so funny
His sense of humour is just op🔥
I opened dictionary evey second
This is BY FAR THE BEST.
He is a role model most down to worth actor , I learn something from him never give up. He was thrown out from little srudions in early 80&#39;s after near decade his first three movies were mega blockbuster, lately he was most earned actor that crosses holly wood actors, and become one of most top three influential celebrities across globe. I remember his saying  one our Bollywood actors will earn in dollars as per stardust magzine. Now we can see all khans are in Bollywood are earning more then hollywood actors.Every success full person has to go throughout a unsuccessful time depends upon how long it span  is,,,,,
Only someone as magical as Shahrukh Khan can narrate something so painful @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=120">2:00</a> and make it humorous ❤️
i LOVE THIS!!!
That standing ovation 🚀🚀
Sometimes it just feels that I am giving this talk. I&#39;ll be genuine to my core. I haven&#39;t ever had this much similarity to anyone other than him. I have seen many of his interviews and everytime I feel that &quot;WTF!!! Exactly the answer which I had thought&quot; <br>PS: Yes I am also handsome like him (without putting in much effort). But ofc I am still much much younger than him. Don&#39;t know what and how I will be when I reach his age. Just bless me and wish that I can also make an impact on humanity (in a good way) like him,  cause it&#39;s (coincidentally) exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=180">03:00</a> IST (Indian standard time) when I am posting this comment and I have spent all my day infront of my laptop to code a quantum circuit which can once n for all solve the the question &quot;Why is Universe moving in direction of more randomness&quot; (entropy increase). God bless you whoever reads this comment !!! Hare Krishna !!! La illaha il lalaha !!!
Wow, I Love You Shah
♥️
India is proud of you SRK
No1 can match his level in entire bollywood.. he is unique..
Proudly living in the country of srk...♥️<br>India ♥️

Shame me if can but I am telling you, Mr Shahrukh Khan is the most well-thought and excellent speaker Bollywood has got ever.
I love sharukh Khan so much. He is so humble and a very wise man. I can listen to him speak all day and not get fatigued.

Shahrukh gem 💎yaar. Ma bhi ussi raaste per hu.
Shahrukh Khan son the of a Chief Engineer &#39;Mr. Taj Mo. Khan&#39; and an award winning Oxford degree holder mother &#39;Lateef Fatima&#39; . . . .<br><br>1. Tried justifying his third son legitimacy (that no logical person asked for, we don&#39;t need your useless explanation for even if he&#39;s a love child that&#39;s your affair your matter)<br><br>2. पोथी पड़ी पड़ी जग मुआ, भुआ नहीं 🤣, मुआ  . . स्क्रिप्ट लिखने वाले ने थोड़ा गलत लिखा और आपने पढ़ दिया बस ? आपको हिंदी काव्य की एक लाइन खुद से नहीं आती ?. . . What a great way to do PR (ie improve your public relation)<br><br><br><br>Indeed he&#39;s worked his way up . . . But guess what he&#39;s a bodybuilder on steroids
Proud of our country 🇮🇳❤️

great....
He has a prompter in his ears,someone wrote the speech,someone made him practice and someone guided him through his deliverance.But guess who gets the credit,charlatan khan,i mean shahrukh khan.
King ❤️
I respect his journey, his talent, him being the best at what he does, but tell me one thing, he talks about self love and goes on to endorse fairness and bleaching cremes countless times..why? I get about him earning money and it ultimately generating revenue but is it not exactly opposite to what he preaches?
Shahrukh khan sir my inspiration idol role model love from German
I&#39;m not a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. Still, I have watched this 5 times. I must admit that he is one of the best Public speaker of India. The best part about this talk was Shah Rukh started with Namaskar which shows he respects Indian Culture and he showed that he&#39;s a true Indian first and then a Muslim.
❤️
His obsession for self love is what we should abide. Thus its easy to give away and shower love.
It’s sad to see that some people call him traitor because media misinterpreted his words on intolerance . Here , in this speech he spoke about the greatness of india and her philosophies .
Watching this 7th time... Everytime learning something new.
Spread love
Love you SHAH ❤️
He (srk) is the real man, who comes from powerful places, whom we called India 🇮🇳
Amazing Sir.<br>Respect increased and especially for mentioning Bharat in a positive Light.<br>You are really very knowledgeable 🙏
This guy is my favorite indian person
no matter how many time I just watch this episode it always gives me a booster to flourish and this man is just amazing I&#39;m always akin to his prosperity and internal strength to his country the way just he presents his country and culture is amicable. Love you King 👑 💞 💓
I love how he carries his indianess with him wherever he goes.
Hi dildar
Lit
Aid
Love you Shah!!! Pride of India 🇮🇳 Spread love not hate
How can someone hate him. How?
This is just like a poetry...So PROUD he is an Indian!!
He has excellent collection of words , appreciation for you sir.
He must lecture about the an origin of species too.!
People don&#39;t realised that SRK is also highly Self Educated and have Very high Intellectual Knowledge and wisdom in literature..... He&#39;s just the most Lovable and The onlt Actor in India who represents India so well into the Global Stage....just to name a Few he has the title of Dr. And while most celebs are ban in some countries or the other Shah Rukh Khan Is knighted by Malaysian and got the highest honor on France and so many other Countries...He is just The King of Bollywood and The Badshah of Bollywood... Don&#39;t call him King Khan For no reason
Wow this is sooo goood speech this will be push to think what is good or wrost for us
Srk 😭❤️🥺
Love You Man!
Still watching (26/04/2022)❤️
All time my favourite one
The great
SRK is a greatest ever actor
🛡️🏦🗽👊🌟👑🏛️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Hey I am not interested in you ,You have commonly given birth to someone or gone mad at hizada I do want to know just stay away from me do not involve my name with you.Its so shameful for me.🤧
It’s 2022. He was right back then, He is the last of stars.
I&#39;m not a fan of Shahrukh but the sheer flow in which this talk has progressed is overwhelming
Giving examples of India to spread love 😁😁😁😁where hitters rule
His speech was okay, his stardom is worse; but his wit, charm and humour........ Now that&#39;s something I can&#39;t traverse 👍👍👍👍👍
He&#39;s spectacular 😍
I like shah rukh I am from Uzbikistan
Hello brather I am from  Uzbekistan
I feel pity for those who don&#39;t know SRK well enough or who don&#39;t admire him.He is a living legend!
The way he describe India and its culture is not everyones game i am his fan since i was born and i am 22 now and loves him and will love him forever and ever cause this man never ever should be hated he is what India means diverse and beautiful 💓
पुरानी क्लीप दिखाके इसको मत चमकावो!
❤️❤️
Very disappointed by his speach writer the people stopped laughing on his humour just after the 2nd mint.<br>There were too many jokes to digest so you start ignoring them.
Speechless. 👏🏻
Too great speech
An Indian inspiring 💪❤️
is using botox dirty or something?
is using botox dirty or something?
wah kya english bole sir 💪🏼.
Absolutely brilliant
anyone has done note making and summary of this i am stuck here due to school work
The first movie that I ever watched as a kid was of SRK, I was then may be 4-5 years old but I fell in love with that 30 years old man. Gradually, growing up, I started watching more of his art films than his commercial dramas, then I realized my keen interest in Drama, theatrical culture, cinematography, direction, scripts etc., being a small town girl from a very common and middle class family, I was always told that the world I was dreaming of, was something I could never achieve, as a teenager I was told I can never make my ends meet in the show business, the eighteen years old me had to choose a carrier that wasn’t what I dreamed of ever. <br>Even though I could never build up the courage to fight the stereotype of a small town middle class girl to become a writer/director in show business, I would say I wasn’t courageous enough to be SRK ever. I chose to be a mediocre, I chose to have a simple life that I never wanted to have, I chose to write comments in my phone on Ted Talks.<br>I really would like to appreciate what SRK must have gone through to achieve what he is today, lots of love to SRK. I’m your fan forever.
But some stupid people compare him with Salman boi..🙃
shah rukh khan is a book. he;s last of the stars.
Dear srk <br>This is not a laughing place where u stand .talk like a gentle person.<br>Don&#39;t show yourself like clown.<br>Whatever u delivered it&#39;s a full wasting of time .

The guy who&#39;s gaining love respect and representing India to the whole world beautifully is getting hate propaganda back to back in his own nation 🇮🇳

Shah Rukh Khan is the best person in Bollywood, giving more to humanity, such a great inspiration...
Love You SRK Sir ❤️ Fan Of Yours Till Last Breath
His Words Are Heal To Pain ❤️
Haters Call Him Hakla/Bakra As He Did A Just Of Role Stammer In Darr Movie And It Created A Impact On Their Mind That He Stammers In Reality But They Forgot Many Times That He Has Been Invited To Various International Universities For Giving Speech Like In Yale University, Edinburgh University <br>In Shot SRK Haters Ki Gaand Jalti Rahegi Aur SRK Haters Ka Bhosada Phatta Rahega 😊🙂😉
♥

Don&#39;t talk about humanity yarr, you are selling poison..<br>VIMAL.
This is unbelievable. Super intellectual speech.

Lo estoy volviendo a ver, siendo el primer tedtalk del año que me veo, me pareció la mejor charla, recomendado.
Shah Rukh Khan is a living Legend ❤️<br>True inspiration ❤️<br>Lot&#39;s of love my Dear❤️
Don&#39;t quite know the purpose of his talk, but learning to drive at 15  due to circumstances and losing your parents must have fuelled his desire to succeed.
Love will increasing in world with humanity 🌍💖
Loy machedo brought me here

SRK is real, honest , intellectual man but His childs are not that awesome ... Just commenting after Aryan khan case
Love him
I like SRK&#39;s personality very much. One should learn from him the way of thoughts, He is such a humble, hardworking and positive man.. And the best of everything is he believes in himself the most ❤<br>Love u Shah Rukh.. Keep Ruling King
His son is getting caught for different reasons these days
I COME FROM TWO <b>INDIA</b><br>WHERE WE HAVE VIR DAS AND <br><b>SHAH RUKH KHAN</b> .<br>WHEN LIFE GIVES U A STAGE U BETTER REPRESENT THE WAY CAME FROM. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WE SHOULD RESPECT THE NATION AND ITS RESOURCES. <br>PEOPLE BE WRITING :- <br>ARE WE REALLY INDEPENDENT ?😕<br>YES , DUMBASS😀 <br>THATS WHY U CAN  SAY A PERSON-<br>&quot;APNE KAAM SE KAAM RAKH NA&quot;.<br>THATS IT.

He is most popular actor in bangladesh. 🇧🇩🥰 <br>Srk is romantic king.😄
Srk❤️
I could listen to him talk for hours, his voice is so mesmerizing 🥺
Your sqeech is immaculately inspring.
Why people like to be called poor once they achieve huge success , I think everyone wants their story to make exceptional and its the poorness which make it  easier .It means poor people have the right beginning to make a great exceptional stroy.
He is just so amazing ❣️❣️❣️❣️
That&#39;s why he called badshah king of everyone&#39;s heart not only because of his romantic nature as well as his intelligent behaviour💓💓
Hes styly is awesome my fv always.....
Fav actor srk idol srk
Srk is really a great speaker. ❤️🔥🔥
Respected, sharukhan he has great personality and intelligent person.
You should learn something from him .
His age is 56 but he still looks like young people.it&#39;s  great !
Sense of humour 🙌 king

Ye Kisna hai!
&#39;Sown his wild oats&#39; , goshhh can&#39;t get enough of your English man🙏🙏🙏
The best lover and actor on screen and best speaker off screen. ❤️❤️❤️
No one is so intelligent, thoughtful and lovable as shah rukh khan is. 👌👌
Grandfather is a traitor and joined hands with the British against INA
Happy Birthday SRK❤️❤️❤️
I made a tradition in 2020 to re -watch this once every 6 months. Still here. Amaziiiiinggggg!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=750">12:30</a>

Shahrukh khan!! This name is enough to be proud of!!...God bless you shah

the  more i watch the more i love

Saw this again on SRK&#39;s birthday
My whole teenage and adult life I never appreciated him as actor,but I m getting to know this man and as a person he is a gem
Phoenix SRK.rise and shine.
Intellectual speech with sense of humor by the biggest moviestar in the world 😊
Legend ❤️
He is really amazing person, and he is loved in all over the world.

mera dil kamzoor hai
The warm and wisdom in his Voice, what an elegance. I have watched this entire Ted Talk four times 👏👏
Wow. TED talks are promoting people with links to drug cases. Is it that you do whatever to be rich and you be promoted like this. What message was this anyway?? Please have a look at people’s backgrounds before spoiling TED Talks inspirational talks and deserving people. Shame on this guy to bluff so much..
It&#39;s extremely sad to see him visit a jail &amp; that too not for his own mistakes. He bowed to no one all his life but he was forced to this time due to his son&#39;s mistakes. Wish SRK &amp; his family is out of this mess soon!
Anybody after Aryan Khan case 😁😁  ??
Good movie Star ⭐
2021
I knew shah rukh was a profound person, and still this managed to surprise me. My god! What a man and what a speech.
Irony is the Man who is preaching my country my country for all the positive reason possible here, today has to fight with the system and higher authority of the same country for being popular and not coming in term of their ideology and moreover to promote love rather falling for war raging agenda.
❤️❣️
Lol
We love Shah Rukh Khan
Love you Shahrukh Bhai, what a speech 🎉🎉
Actors can express themselves so wisely when they are not interviewed by pinkvilla
One like for SRK❤
if you want to learn english ,repeat this speech again and again thank me later!
Who is watching this ever since, he got framed by the opportunist political party whose main intention is to divert public attention via his son Aryan&#39;s arrest. <br>Shame on the illiterates who are running the largest democracy of the world and taking the country southwards in all respects. 😭
The Best♥
If u didn&#39;t love n enjoy this Ted talk 🚪🚶🏿
I like his humor.
Shahruk you are too good I love you
Sometimes children slip a bit that doesn’t mean parenting is wrong. No parent will ever teach their kids to take drugs. If we practice whatever he is speaking, trust me the world would be a much much better place to live in. Think of a world full of love, compassion, togetherness. Just imagine. No violence, no hard feelings, no hate for any religion or groups. Just pure and simple love. Love that will bind us.
I Love you SRK you are pride of India
i lovee srk !! but the speech here is kinda meaningless, just a mumble, jumble of words.
I don&#39;t know why people in my nation hate him so much.He is such an amazing person.
Wow 🔥
If SRK doesn&#39;t born we wouldn&#39;t feel romance in movies.
Oh God... 😍
Who&#39;s here after  his son&#39;s  drug involvement???
You love him or hate him but no one can deny that he is the wittiest bollywood star and an Excellent speaker.
First and most probably the last 🙂✌🏻
And we all know why he is The SRK
Beautiful 😥
SRK♥️❤️‍🔥
We&#39;re very proud of Shah Rukh Khan. From India🇮🇳
His Son screwed him 🤣🤣🤣
Lag gayi son drug addict 🤣🤣🤣
Send supports to this man, now, the extremist modi BJP , RSS created a fake case against his young son, who had no drugs on him or in him, will not set bail or released him ! Witch hunt is going on against BW artists, in India !
I&#39;m feeling sad for him
Whenever I got anxiety or stress due to hardwork I came here and watch this video it&#39;s is completely amazing loveeeee uhhhh love guru and our motivational Guru ❤️💋😘
Proud to have SRK in India. <br>I love the way he is and his humbleness. <br>SRK really inspires and admire me a lot.
We love you SRK❤️
Let&#39;s perform without the drugs shall we?
Who&#39;s here after Aryan Khan arrest?🤔🙃
recommended to me after aryan khan arrest
This man is diffent what he is real..
His son ARYANKHAN catch by NCB IN DRUG PARY...
Shah Rukh Khan is the only Indian who has been awarded Unesco Pyramide con Marni award for his charity work.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=636">10:36</a>
Supreme levels of confidence was projected through excellent command over the language. Sheer hard work, focus &amp; consecration towards the profession made him super star
This is the man who proved that if you dreams it you can do it.
&quot;He is the most loved celebrity in Universe, period .&quot;
confusing speech..no conclusion
😭I love you 😭😊
I love you srk...... Baadshah.. King. <br>..
This man lost everything in young age family mom dad his sister got depression then started his career by serial bollywood debut by other rejected movies he never give up life true inspiration shahrukh khan sir
Salmon khen be like: phutpath pe mil tu
Great Charisma <br>Telling stories of dead parents with a positive attitude and audience are laughing.
It feels bad when same person does Pan masala add and Fair and handsome add.
Great stuff. I watch several youtube videos on how to trade in the stock market but haven&#39;t made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it and I do not want to make mistakes by taking risks in my own hands.
SIMPLY OBSOLETE.
CSK vs KKR 2012
What a presentation
Love ❤️ love ❤️ love ❤️ Shahrukh 🥰😘😘😘
Didn’t like much
All hail to king srk.
The man he is the Pride of India 🇮🇳♥️
Please suggest me how i improve my speaking skill...?
A good actor as well as a good public speaker
Actually, he is the biggest brand ambassador of India to the world.
Can anyone be this much Charismatic,witty,intelligent and smart? Amazing...India should feel proud of him..such a Huge Star
It&#39;s like poetry and I&#39;m jealous of him
Aahh!!!The Shahrukh Khan 🥰😍😍😍😍😘❣❣❣
BMW i8 🧐🏎️
We get Nothing in this life without struggle..this man got what he really deserves..
Lungi dance lungi dance.......lungi d.n..
I am really mesmerised by his english<br>Awsm guy
This is the best speech I ever heard from an actor.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=630">10:30</a>
Whoever wrote his speech is absolutely brilliant.
Bruh. Too good to be true.
A complete Legend!!
SRK is true philosopher!
Yes, He is the most (not one of the) perfect public personality of all time this country has ever produced. You should appreciate him rather than hating him and making shity comparisons with other actors who are nowhere close of him
lungi dance, lungi dance, lungi dance, lungi dance woooo fall fall fall deeper for just him
Those stupid people who think that Priyanka has made India proud see this interview Priyanka doesn&#39;t even have 1  billion fans whereas srk has around 3.5 billion fans which makes him the biggest celebrity on earth
Awesome person
Great way to be a simple SHAHRUKH, hats off too you for always being this way.
What a great speaker he is!
its wrong to be self obsessed like him
Bhut bdhiya bhai
Gradually I&#39;ve begun to decipher his intentions right after series of attempts to watch. Literally It sounds like poetry.
I love this man very much from Morocco he is very smart and intelligent and very popular man he is the biggest superstar in the world he learn us how to be successful person in this world he is a great man I love him 💖
I am a proud fan of this man.
Baadsah Oh Baadsah 🌹🌹❤️
Only beggar of my heart&#39;s of love mack  them&#39;s God of love for them&#39;s &quot; are never commercial beneficial &quot; must missing direct me iff I needed  more extra whaatt for mee than him&#39;s ?? Is hide worry behind&#39;s sorry for money&#39;s.  Is never TRP or trape data&#39;s.
Who are here after 4 years
He is the one of the best speaker in the world

yaha gyan zaado...or market m guthaka pan masala becho....hadd h yr ....pese k liye kuch b....
I think sir you are a confidence man of the world.
💚✨🙏
Omgggggg he rehearsed his entired fucking speech he probably had it written by some expert , and he mugged it up like a good actor he is , such a fucking waste of Ted talk ,no originality to this at all
I love SRK and have enjoyed many of his movies, but this talk was a cringe-fest. The talk-material was very pretentious and incoherent. Clearly he spent a lot of time memorizing all the &#39;poetic&#39; lines and it felt like he was just reciting textbook literature out of memory. I still can&#39;t tell what exactly was the message for &#39;future-me&#39;. This kind of prose makes for good reading, not speaking. If you&#39;d like to feel more connected to the real human-being that SRK is, watch his talk with David Letterman. That&#39;s so much better than this &#39;philosopher/poet&#39; version he&#39;s trying to awkwardly portray.
<b>Indians</b> assemble
That&#39;s why you are a real king, love you man from Bangladesh &lt;3
Love you SRK king of romance
Inspiration
He is the king of romance ❤️❤️❤️
Omg witty
powerful one better than success
Love you SRK ❤️💯🔥
Srk❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
SRK I love you. You are my super star 🌟
He is an amazing speaker...
The conclusion <br>shahrukh Khan = humanity
I have appreciation for his spirit of trying to spread love. But barely do I think he knows half the time what he is talking about. Sue me.
Sharuk Khan op in the chat
Hope.more people like him in my country
💀
Apple was just an fruit before😂
Man, this is the best TED talk I&#39;ve ever seen
His intellect and charm are unmatched
Telling his tragic moments with a humor - just SRK Things 😎😎
Voice❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤🧡💛💚💙
Lots of love Shahrukh to all of you💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
As a Muslim, u should say as-salamualaikum..to all
Great
Boycott bollywood
This man right here is the reason why my taste in man is so rich!
King for a reason, Amazing public speaker.
SRK is the kingg 🙏❤
Lesbian is the capital of Portugal &gt;&lt;
What an amazing sense of humor and what a good fluency in English👌👍👍🇮🇳🇮🇳
I can watch this any number of times. It is so refreshing to listen to SRK. His wit and humour are unmatched. 🖤
I 💗 BOLLYWOOD 💗 SRK 🔥🔥🔥
So full of himself that it seems so very crass He needs to learn from Mathew McConaughey. Why does this guy always make these self proclamations of greatness and always a sob story about his parents. Very crass &amp; cheap. Lacks class. Other than talking about himself Shahrukh Khan has nothing intelligent or interesting to say
&#39;Humanity is like an aging movie star&#39;<br>-SRK
This has to be the weakest SRK speech, maybe he did that intentionally to support,what he is trying to speak, that is do not really care about anything  and do what you want to do
Live ok guys it&#39;s not you it&#39;s me think about
Well.. someone made use of the thesaurus !!!
Great speech sir.... u always motivated us by giving such speeches...
&quot;In it&#39;s immense generosity, India decided somehow that I, the Muslim son of a broke freedom fighter, who accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams, should become it&#39;s king of romance.&quot; <br>g o o s e b u m p s 🤯
where he said the one who used to ugly become the king of bollywood anybody know tell me
&#39;I belongs to poor family &quot;<br>&quot;I don&#39;t have job and money &quot;<br>&quot;I have to handle my family &quot;<br>&quot;but YouTube is not giving me subscriber and views &quot;😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏<br>&quot;ya my condition is worse than other.
Who is here for just SRK
Love you srk🤩😍🤍🤍
Wo star nahi hai, duniya hai meri.
You are 1 in a Billion !!! You are reason behind every youngster Dream in get into Bollywood !!!
Those guys don&#39;t know who they&#39;re listening to.
SRK is not good for India 👎👎
I really think I&#39;m the 8th million view....
srk damm i have never seen this speech hats off.. srk i can&#39;t imagine that the speech I love ...u srk.. u inspired a lot of people. and I want to become like srk one day
A beautifull human been ❤
Love you to max SRK❤️
Such a mindful person. He speaks with so much dedication and hopefulness. Shahrukh has got such a charming personality. His presence of mind, an intellectual person with so much awareness. He really is a great human being. All my love to SRK ❤❤<br>God bless him and always keep him and his family happy.
You are the perfect soul in the perfect place in the perfect time. Universe takes you for give Love around all the world 💖🌺
very good
&quot;The bottom line is, there&#39;s no any country better than india&quot; - Shah Rukh Khan ❤️
He is first person to become famous in a whole world in hero
Shahrukh Khan, you beauty! Love you to the moon and back. 😍
# Im last of the 🌟
Love you, SRK.
U are lagend love from kashmir
If shah Rukh khan wouldn&#39;t have been an actor, he would have been the best stand up comic in the world.
🙏🏽
Till now &quot; WORLDS BIGGEST SUPERSTAR &quot; proud to be indian actor ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The Only Actor talks in Ted talks in India&#39;.. Sharukh Khan always proud India&#39; in the world..I think everyone proud him..✔️😇✨
I didn&#39;t know he was aware of everything, going around him!
This men is a legend
damn shah rukh khan are my favorite bollywood actor since i was little
It was very amazing speech. He told us the key of life &#39;Love&#39;.
Love you all
He took sanskrit to an international platform , many would have not done it
Such a big star , whole world loves him, but still in India some people hate him because of his religion , forgotting everything he has done for the country , i could see the pain in him when he said about internet.
Very well done
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV1KdWRHck&amp;t=542">9:02</a> pure magic

what an absolutely marvelous man. love him forever and ever.
Thank you Shah Rukh Khan for representing India in such an amazing way. <br>Definitely one of my favourite ted talks
im in love with his presentation his way of delivering both his sucess and failures his content everything was just beyond my vocab hatsoff srk
Haters of him can&#39;t even understand the words on the speech he is given
Pround the be Indian....SRK bhai....actually what he said really touched my bottom of heart,  really cool...
I can clearly say that why do people listen to this man cause illiteracy towards great knowledge to ancient Indian philosophy
Srk is now a philosopher than that of an actor
Sera
Shahrukh Khan
The legend of world
When you understand shahrukh..you stop watching his movies and start listening his speeches.
Favourite superstar
Ok. This is one of the most elegant ted talks ever. And the love he has for his motherland makes each one of us love the country even more .
Inspirational srk
The verdant certification laterally refuse because plain constitutively cause opposite a abrasive mailbox. tightfisted, public push
The sticky racing coronally whistle because supply postsynaptically measure qua a unequal stop. fine, wholesale chest
Sah raukh Khan Ted talk would be like me
Great Human Being 👏👏👏👏👏
He is a perfect man what a speech
Great
I can&#39;t believe people thought srk was ugly back in the days damn well that didn&#39;t age well at all 😂😂😂
