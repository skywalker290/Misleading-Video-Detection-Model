The thing I like most about the movie is it’s not cgi
Roman, always complaining🤣🤣🤣
Viry good videos
Hi
honestly furious 7 and 9 were my favorite<br>now lets see fast x..
❤
When i realised Paul died at Nov 2013.. And i was born in July 2013.. I was in tears because my favourite actor died.. Still my favourite but Sung might be the 1st now..🥲
Lol, the W motors Lykhan specs are all claimed specs, nothing has been proven yet. Seems to be built by a bit of a dodgy guy
Rip Paul Walker<br>????-2014<br>Best movie fast 5,6and 7
gerçekten kimisi sürüyor sanmıştım
that lykan car sure is ugly af tho, looks likes one of those hundays
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zX9imKSck&amp;t=522">8:42</a> roman never changes 😂😂
We are all gonna miss Paul because Paul is the best in fast and furious.
Miss u paul ❤️
Just Love how the movies were made
Roman car 💀😂
Без монтажа погони выглядят на много лучше чем в фильме, в фильме на столько всё смазано что я думал что это 3D графика
🔥🔥🔥💯
Ads too long didn’t watch
่าสสวสส่ัะะดเ่าสว...
Supra😍
Roman, I can&#39;t love you less❤️<br>Dom. U continue to stay strong ai&#39;it<br><br>Sleep tight Paul (Brian)
Ending scene🥲
I could watch any fast and furious movie over and over again. Theyre just so good man. R.I.P Paul :(
<b>Roman:</b> The car is ugly. I went to see my therapist about it. 😂😂
So these guys actually bash these cars.....oh my goodness....and here i was thinking most of it is CGI.  All those beauties.....sob sob.. FF7 was my best in the sequel
Rest in peace Bryan
I love vin diesel n wanna act Wit him.good work teams
That ending is really sad😭
Azerbayjan🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
That parachute scene was shot in Azerbaijan🇦🇿
The red car really made me cryy😭
Beautiful Sweet heart 😘😍😘
I really loved the mods for the GTR here, it&#39;s very minimalistic yet effective. The Knight Racer Mine&#39;s spoiler was a welcome addition to the car
it still blows my mind how they do these stunts IN REAL LIFE, with little to none cgi
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23spperez">#Spperez</a>
Who knows where the road is and the parting of Vin and Paul in the last scene ??? R.I.P Paul Walker
ME GUSTO MUCHO EL VIDEO DETRAS DE CAMARAS RAPIDOS Y FURIOSO
ARREPENDEI-VOS, PORQUE  ESTÁ PRÓXIMO O REINO DOS CÉUS.
Michelle looks gorgeous!
Michelle and Vin look great!

Furious 7 was there best film 🎞
Wow....very nice👍

So marvelous
I like that raw steel concept on that charger
Rip

If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and please Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 (Not trying to force upon anyone who does not agree.  )
Hi bro love from rajahmundry ❤️
rip paul
big legend in our little hearts
Rip legend paul❤😭
I am shocked that some of the stunts were not real
I missss paul😭😭😭😭😰😰😰😭😭😭
“went to see my therapist abt it” 🤣
To me the iconic B-Body Charger is like Kenny from South Park. Kenny from South Park gets killed in every episode only to be awaken in his bedroom &amp; come back with his friends in the next episode. The iconic B-Body Charger on the other hand gets destroyed in every installment, (18-wheeler semi-truck collision, explosive barrier collision, crushed by an armoured vehicle, sacrificial collision to rescue lover, tumble destruction, submarine explosion), and revives itself like it just woke up from a nightmare.
Roman owes us for the horrendous mistake that was the eclipse in 2f2f, he&#39;ll get over being in a Monte again 😂.
Need that black red off-road car ha
2021
Yess ....it was very emotional very

RIP Legend

The flaky cheetah explicitly wobble because step-grandfather annually doubt circa a keen turkish. legal, descriptive question
I love this movi series.
Anyone else thinks it would be better if it was R34 instead of R35 in the drone chase in Furious 7
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zX9imKSck&amp;t=527">8:47</a> even he said the car was ugly😂😂.Dennis just ruined Tyrese&#39;s car reputation in this scene
With the green screen it made me mad &gt;:C

I dont know if yall realized this. and i dont know if it was on purpoe or not. but. Brian was set in a white car. that is Pual Walkers, real personal car. it was also white and shiny. and Brian was wearing a white shirt. and a big smile. and the sun seemed to shine on him. my thoughts are. they did this as a subtle nod to him being with the cast and crew during the film and to mean. even though your gone. your still in our hearts.
I Like how the background song is the song from Tokyo drift last race
Does anyone know a way to watch the entire  collection?
I have Paul walkers car
انا عربي فقط
Dom: Gets his own signature Charger<br>Brian: gets a brand new GTR <br>Shaw: Aston martin so signify being british <br>Roman: Lol give him a box or anything, idk

Paul is a legend but he is in a better place now R.I.P. Paul Walker

I dont know why but the way they&#39;re all talking about the movie&#39;s characters like outsiders after me associating them more with the characters than the real actors makes me feel a little funky

R.I.P. Paul Walker you are the best actor 😖😖😞😪❤❤🙏
R.i.p Paul, but why would he think it would be cool speeding in a hyper car
Come back Brain 😔
where&#39;s james wan?
How many cool cars did they broke in that movie?
film bukan kaleng kaleng
You&#39;re actually smooth brain if you think they destroyed real Lykan&#39;s for the shoot. There are only 7 in the world and cost millions. They basically slapped a Lykan body on a cheaper car. For the drop you could clearly see that it was just a body and a chasis
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpgp3bueeiM">https://youtu.be/qpgp3bueeiM</a>  This is awesome, must watch.

The lykan hypersport is beautiful! But Dom and charger rt is like iron man and his armour! I liked the camaro z 28, really cool! It&#39;s very funny when Tyrese say: &quot; i think cool, i think great but i think this car is ugly! 😁🤙 hahahahaaa
Acting is always fake
Algum do brasil??
اوسخ من الإمارات مافي
The lichen hyper sport is not the fastest car it is the devil 16
Pensé que alómenos manejaban un poquito pero no jodan todo es pantalla verde
Oh down you it is..... Cossack
God damit.. I&#39;ve something in my eye.. :&#39;( It hits always when I see that ending scene.
I really like supras but one day I wish to be in the fast and furious movies

Best Film .
&quot;no one&#39;s ever built an off road charger&quot; <br><br><br><br>roadkill: am I a joke to you?
Those cars are cool how expensive are they a million dollars
700
CraZy ride🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
Its crazy because there bringin han back and at this time nobody knew
Algum brasileiro aqui? Kkkk
Pauls personal supra? How about the 911 porche he crashed in?
Vin Diesel saying that his charger is the most iconic car in history is just a little exaggerated!! Only car enthusiast and fans of the franchise would recognize that car! You can show a picture of the General Lee, KITT or the Bandit&#39;s Trans Am to anybody and they would recognize them! The Charger will not be first in this race!
i miss paul so much😭😭💔
has anyone watched need for speed? in 2015 they said there was going to be 2 but so far they have canceled, does anyone know if it will be?
Muito foda
Least be honest you didn&#39;t searched for this in 2020
En estos momentos és donde me gustaria saber inglês
GOSH!!!!!!!
Só Eu de BR Aq ?
If they&#39;re really crashed naturally musclecars, I&#39;m goona director of that movie

Melhor filme de toda existência
That doms hot rod isnt the most iconic car in ever the batmobile tops it
What happened to FAST and furious
If it helps at least I tried .!!.
I told Han&#39;s Story I told my Father&#39;s Side of the Story I told my side of the story I told my best friends side of the story I told Reid&#39;s Side of the story I told the crazy blond side of the story whom tried to steal my baby I told bobby&#39;s side of the story I said Scotty Sch&#39;s Side of the story Basically that&#39;s everyone oh yeah I even finished the whole squabble between Dom &amp; Hoch I told his story I fished it all the hardest part was somehow collaborating my brother&#39;s side of the story into it I did it but it was hard .!!.
I had to introduce my brother in the seventh series because I had to write the transporter series first to be able to make him into that character once I got that down then I could mixed him into the whole kitten Kaboodle , <br>I really didn&#39;t know how to mix my brother into the series I had to kind of  really had go out of the box for that one my brother was the villain bad guy that I had to turn good and I had to introduce that to mix that into the whole series without any interruptions or without confusing my fans I really didn&#39;t even want to do it but it was part of the story that I didn&#39;t tell that I had to tell Cool Right .!!.

This car is perfect for me .
Some mechanics get to build fast and clean cars. Some, some get to build toys.
Fast and furious has a crazy car collection but i don&#39;t know why their brand is not common could be that the prices are high that people can&#39;t afford?
fucking amazing how this is made , incredible

Black in red is kitt colors in a show call knight rider, yes.

Paul Walker said touch down baby
One of my favourite actors in this movie and then he has too die in a car crash. <br><br>May he rest in Peace.😢
This is how many people give their respects to Paul <br>⬇️      Edit: I was not trying to use Paul I just wanted to put out  my respect to the actor and many said I used him in a way I kind of did but I won’t gain anything from likes on a comment guys.
Lykan is not the fastest.the fastest car is called a devel sixteen
