aaand he was actually right,... the website is offline LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=140">2:20</a> idk why but this cracked me up so much. RICH CARS, EXPENSIVE! Maybe he meant: expensive cars, rich? 😂
Jake Paul is actually trying to help people. What are you doing to help people and your fans out Pewdiepie?
a good random algorithm and random recommendation...revisiting old vids
Dude student loans are fucked in the US
Student loan debt is a whole different ball park in america though.
I really didnt believe in the movement until he said Lenny&#39;s Pizza, now im truly with the movement
H8er
FFM was literally a hustlers university before it happend
Watched this video like 10 times. I love when good people troll back to expose criminals. &lt;3
Its a tradition to go back here every once in a year
Wow Pews predictions aged really well, the website doesn’t exist anymore!
Its so funny that the site is really down now 😂
The hate for jake paul from pewdiepie is real 😂
Yes the same generation that created a sexuality based on their favourite youtuber is smarter than other generations.
Female. Female. Male porn hahahaha ffm
Lol I&#39;m surprised u werent taken to porn results .... Ffm 😂
feel like the problem was that jake had learning difficulties or just laziness in school
This guy use pads for training me : wooden boards and concrete ground <br>Tate use wood<br>Jake is cheesy
those kids are ruined if they follow his advice 🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=488">8:08</a><br>Coffeezilla was here all this time.
What is the update about this movement?
Student loan is one of the cheapest loans - a Swedish man
Jake would probably climb over a glass wall to see what is on the other side
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=315">5:15</a>
All that money and you can&#39;t even be bothered to hook up a PA for your own event?? Bruh.
He&#39;s trying to be Andrew tate and break the matrixs
I cant believe that Jake´s scam is more professional than Tate´s scam.
This was the demo for Andrew tate
Jake Paul is the definition of 1IQ
I would pay a million$ to knock out pewdie pie and see how he trash talk after that
Hi, my name is Jake Paul and im the dumbest piece of shit.
I think the student loans in Sweden are different than america.
The first person I would trust my finances is Jake Paul
Bless pewdiepie for cleaning up youtube of such filth
anyone who does the lego ninjago kai thing on there eye brow isn’t a very intelligent person
this is the video i keep coming back to, i love it, all hail dan fleyshman
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=488">8:08</a> BEND OVER
I love how everyone rn loves this guy. Did everyone forget about the multiple scams Jake was responsible of? I take pride in never supporting Jake Paul lol
he just moistened his lips felix, calm down haha, he&#39;d been talking for a long time.
Step one to financial freedom: scam young uneducated people.
If he’s a smart one in the school Jake Paul. Why don’t we just Google him. From his name and school and see what pops up. Questions comments ideas thoughts. Stay safe stay away from scammers. Reporting to authorities. And shut the scammers down.
student loans in US are a problem but that&#39;s because college is just too expensive ...
how to become a worldwide known influencer:<br><br>1. be the brother of a worldwide known influencer.<br><br>That&#39;s it.
I don’t disagree with the message that a lot of what school teaches is pointless, but he turned it into this whole ego trip about praising himself for being kind of a messiah.  Totally strays from the point he’s trying to make.
I know this is old but why does Jake Paul act like economics isn’t a class you take in high school
Pewdiepies parents are Richie rich rich. He was too proud to ask money from them, he used to eat Marconi cooked plain.
very wrong about the    Student loan thing  homie ....   Anyone that went to school, and took out &quot;legit&quot;  loans   and are late 20s early 30s+  with high paying jobs  haven&#39;t even paid back the principal because of all the Interest accrued
Arvid Assburg
I&#39;m not a fan of him but he made well over 40 million last year lol. That&#39;s more than you and literally everyone on these comments combined lol
I just watch this every year brothers
gotta love how he named himself arvid assburg LMAO
I appreciate going to school more now, thank u jp morgon
this is the reason why i continue to watch pewds.<br>he always debunk all nonsense that most idiotfluencers throw out there
I literally watch jake paul videos on other youtubers so that I can hate him without helping him make money. Watching him is like asmr but instead of feeling relax, you feel cringe.
Damn the thumbnail
Hahahahhahaha
Yes, I want financial advice from someone who never finished high school. I want him to tell me that my college degree is worthless and that my student loans (which I&#39;ve paid off) are ruining my life. Personally I would rather work a regular job than exploit children for money.
Woah, you guys complain about paying TAXES? Don&#39;t worry, if we don&#39;t get our caps in time, we will send out a collection team... and we will get our caps...
How is Jake Paul supposed to learn how to read good when he can&#39;t even fit inside the building??!!
&quot;Who this is NOT for: People who believe that education requires massive debt and countless years of outdated education taught by people who don&#39;t have the results you want(aka the standard education system today)&quot; <br><br>Years later and he&#39;s STILL dissing teachers. <br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I agree that our education system is bad and it could use a lot of improvement but basically saying &quot;if you want to be successful, don&#39;t go to school they got nothing for you&quot; is just...woooooow
pewdiepie funny asl
Just wait for him to suddenly buy something expensive after that
I want Jake Paul to advertise all the bad things, as they have the exact opposite effect
We need the yearly update 😌
my nigga &quot;they&quot; are the haters
We live in a aociety
Engagement
How would they think we can have less that 1% of people making money whit internet if there would not be 99% of people cabble to pay to them.
McGregor would have shown him in one punch
❤️
You can now get a lifetime membership for $20 lol....all the suckers who paid that per month.
Are u with me he wanna mess al of us with his bad hobby n profession
The lip thing that jake paul did at the end of the first video, when felix reenacted that, that got me  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=156">2:36</a>
Pewdiepie: What MrABroad doing? <br>Me: Just created new song for all youtubers. <br>This song is a must to hear. 🤘
well another scam by Jake and no cops... shocked ;\
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=105">1:45</a> <br>Well, not in US ,in US companies hound you for it and trick you into paying more and more and goverment sits there and watches you burn because both Reps and Dems are paid by these companies.😐😑<br>Not a Jake Paul fan tho.
Because of jake, I’ll become a doctor without even needing to go to school
Lmaoo this video, reactions are on point haha
Pewdiepie,can you attend online English classes? 🥸 Professor Pie
the 12k people who unliked this are probably jake&#39;s fans LMFAO
swedish tuition must be a lot cheaper than us tuition.  you&#39;ll get that paid back in a few decades.
i dont like jake paul
jake is so roasted
You know if historical figures like Napoleon, Caesar and Khan saw Jake, he would be executed in seconds
Thumbnaio got me 😂
why i have watched this video 3 times
Imagine all the kids going up to their parents asking for money to join this jake paul movement. Imagine the kids explaining this to their parents and imagine what the parent must be thinking about this whole thing 😂😂😂
Aylmfao
I mean, aside from this stupid FFM scam, I think your take on student loans is based on your experience in Europe (I know that&#39;s pretty obvious) that you may think they&#39;re pretty fair, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same for the USA. Maybe the system is similar, even the amount of money, but the economical and political contex weighs a lot too in this kind of matter.
They hid the subscriber amount from their YouTube channel😭💀
I don&#39;t watch a lot of long videos but man PewDiePie does a great job of keeping me captivated. Real OG of youtube!
Monthly access 40$ (50% off)<br>Yearly access 480$ (70% off)<br>Last I checked, 12 months in a year<br>12 X 40 = 480<br>So, yearly regular price is more expensive then 12 monthly ones...<br>That&#39;s not how business works in the real world.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=188">3:08</a> &quot;maybe if you stayed in school, you would know what a dozen is&quot; LMAO
Every time I feel I lagged in life I watch jake&#39;s financial movement
Anyone got that Ed Sheeran ad?
Pewdiepie talking about student loans are the most affordable loans ....... ok swede
Somebody fcking kill me
&quot;student loans are one of the most fair loans you can get&quot;
If your gonna write a whole ass paragraph dissing the education system, you might want to be grammatically correct🤦😂
And I am very passionate about Jake&#39;s mom
Udemy is cheaper wtf
Arvid Assberg gets me everytime.
Jake actually motivated me to try in school and not listen to his bs
Why does everyone talk shit about 9 to 5 jobs? I worked a 9 to 5 job for 2.5 years as a computer technician before I started going to University to study Cyber Security and it was some of the most rewarding and enriching work I’ve ever had and I while I have to move on to bigger and better things, I never felt like it was a slog. <br><br>If you really enjoy your work then it barely feels like work. Do what you love and the money will come.
Like Bend over 😂😂😂😂 !!
If there’s a book about “50 reasons you should stay at school”, they should just take a picture of JP.”
&quot;Money goes to the one who knows&quot;<br>&quot;Money flows to financially educated people&quot;<br>Pewds, I&#39;m gonna figure out the best way to take advantage of Student loan
The thumbnail makes me hate him even more
Student loans are not great in the US

It was funny how he named his account Arvind Assburg lol
Everyone has 9-5 jobs I have 7am-12am everyday
Viva Pewdiepie. You&#39;re literally the smartest realest guy on youtube and I don&#39;t give a shit about gaming I like you for your personality and how much you humble you are and sense of humour and also your sweet wife, I&#39;m a proud  French-Algerian fan❤🇨🇵🇩🇿 everybody loves you in both of my countries.

You shuld box jake paul and talk later
hows this generation smarter? They&#39;re filing ther teeth on tiktok right now XD

Jake justs increased my cringe level 200 hundred percent
nobody&#39;s gonna talk about BEN DOVER ? Bendover i mean !
its financial freedom for a second
i dont want to be mentored with these guys
Imagine listening to Jake (Buy My Merch) Paul on how to get financial freedom
who retires at 65 wtf?<br><br>I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t
9 to 5 is better than 24/7 thinking bout money
Jake Paul disses an education he never even completed. Most kids are irresponsible and carefree and don&#39;t want to work. It doesn&#39;t mean school is pointless. Jakes such an idiot
TROUBLE
Moral of the story: If you don&#39;t study, you become like Jake Paul?
Jake Paul is now a boxer... I guess the movement failed, again! Maybe he&#39;ll re-brand it and try again
Why are we sitting in a history class if our teachers haven&#39;t even discovered America and participated in the world war?

Student loans are horrible in America. School is over priced
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine being a human and having so much hatred&quot;
That site is closer to a pyramid scheme than a help to society.
Who else giggled at Ben Dover?
Some of us just don&#39;t have the personality disorder to tweet elite martial artists, gaslighting them into making millions.
<b>Billy gene is not my lover...</b><br><br><br><br>It&#39;s Billie Eilish
The financial freedom movement YouTube channel has their subscriber count hidden lmao
His website is still up by the way. If you search it up the first thing you see is an &#39;Interactive Experience&#39; where you choose between Jake Paul and three of his friends to drink toilet water.
as if jake would have paid any more attention in class if they talked about practical every day economics<br>we&#39;re talking about a spoiled kid who has never been through any trouble in life and whose existence has been somehow blessed with enormous luck, resulting in a soulless superficial personality that won&#39;t care about any thing apart from his bank account and his drip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=835">13:55</a> is the best way to describe &quot;Jake Paul&quot; i 100% agree
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=300">5:00</a> Can&#39;t believe it, he&#39;s litterally explaining that artists should accept to be paid in exposure.
U trash talking Jp made my day lmao
Learn for me and go back to school idiots
Wtf I cringed so much thx pewds dis is awesome
Jake - maybe some of you are too young to know this<br>Was that a self confession that his audience is kids
Jake paul is upto fight ksi
‘Legitimate people talk about this’ 1 minute later Jake’s pulls up experts 😂
Jake Paul made me not gay
jake is so cringe
Title:what is Jake Paul up to?<br><br>Me:sees another video but thumbnail is Jake Paul face being cancelled

<b>Sigh.</b><br>Stay in school, kids.
⬆️ 🗳 DAMN RIGHT , NIKO IS WAY BETTER THRAN JAKE AND LOGAN PAUL. 💬

You are so funny
Imagine you sitting in the class, drawing random things on your book and thinking i am smartest kid in the class, i dont need this school, i am better than this. this teacher can teach me somthing? Nah, i bet im now smarter than him.
Bro student loan in my uni is fuking something else

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=577">9:37</a> omg I can’t when I saw bts pop up randomly 😂
So y&#39;all just decided to ignore the dude named Ben Dover? 😂😂
Isn’t there a class called career readiness?
Good ole BenD over peeping in the comments
He can barely string a sentence together
&quot;I was the smartest kid in class&quot;<br><b>England is my city</b>
Thanks for rosting that sh**t
I have more subscribers then them
I just love how Pewds takes pleasure in roasting Jake<br><br><br><br>And I feed off it.
Damn it&#39;s been a year already. Somehow this was the most boring year of my life but at the same time the one that went by the fastest
Jp its actually a disease that even the disease community don&#39;t want to acknowledge him.
9 to 5 jobs he is complaining about my mom works from 6am to 8pm
Your giving him clout
why is the history teacher teaching us about presidents if he was never a president
With that 70’s porn music in the background of LP’s 2nd video🤣
PEWDIEPIE, BEN ASKREN IS CALLING YOU FOR A LAST ROAST TO JAKE PAUL
&quot;Ben Dover&quot; more like &quot;Bend Over&quot;
anyone watching this after he got pie faced at the press conference by askren?<br><br>It would have been funny fuck if after he face timed masvidal, askren facetimed pewdie who has 4x the subscriptions
Pewdiepie
And you’re right there is lots of people that are inspiring.. such as you? Presidepie?
FFM is literally a scam. A waste of money and time
In my school, we had maths and economics. So we learned the quadratic formula (I didn&#39;t take maths so IDK if that&#39;s a real thing) and we learned about taxes, insurance, loans, and investing. You can have both in a regular high school education. I don&#39;t get his problem.
is the site still updating? YT channel is dead btw.
&quot;Ben Dover&quot;
Jake: &quot;there are a lot of people on student loan right now...&quot; Sounds like an American problem to me.
Jake guru gives gurus nightmare...
Jake Paul motivated me to never ever have children that drop out of nursery (kindengarten)
Shouldnt the captions just be for highlights? Why did he caption every single word?
&quot;maybe if you stayed in school, jake, you would know what a dozen is... Jesus Christ...&quot;
this was a nice B-Day present... thx Pewds lol
Jake Paul face looks way older than pewds lmao
What can I learn from Jake Paul? He&#39;s stupid.
FYI YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO OUR GENERATION JAKE
yo, who actually dislikes this video? 💀
That “bruh” sound effect
ARVID ASSBURG
Shut up Pewds. You aren&#39;t funny
bruh my lame minecraft yt channel has more subs the the financial freedom movement lol
Jake Paul is just dumb 🤣🤣.
Gotta say the site is build solid<br>I wonder how much Jake Paul squeezed from those sponsers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=560">9:20</a> made it look like jake was the &#39;entertainment&#39; at a birthday party or smthn
@PewDiePie sign up, im sure you have 20$ and see what you get and how much of a scam it is? 20 bucks wont hurt you and you have some more cringy content
WHAT THE HYUCK IS STUDENT LOAN???
It&#39;s getting to the point where I struggle to find fan comments on Jake&#39;s videos
Ben Dover? Nah Bend Over
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=271">4:31</a> thats team 10
I cracked on Billy Gene XD
the first time i came across pewdiepie i was soo confused why a gamer had soo much subs but after watching a few of his reactions to stuff , i get it , its his personality that draws attention , hes a humble genuine fella
Imagine if Jake Paul was smart.  🤔
How can you learn the quadratic equation if your teacher didn&#39;t invent the the formula.
How surprising, a multi-millionaire who doesn&#39;t have a real job and doesn&#39;t understand anything about actually being in debt is shitting on a movement that want to actually help educate kids in finance and expose how fucked up the American education system really is. wtf is your problem pewds
Umm excuse me, he said what to Zayn?! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=12">0:12</a>
Join our movement or the $1.5 dollar student debt. $1.5 seems fair to avoid JP...
pewds needs to roast jake paul more
I would definitely love an update on how insanely good this movement has been going
I wonder how many content creators forked over 20 bucks to Jake to make fun of his website lol
idk how student loans work in uk but in america they are such bs and can be misunderstood so quickly
Damn this was exactly one year ago..
did i see manny khoshbin p1 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=138">2:18</a>
Pewdiepie is somebody who acts Dumb but is actually Smart,<br>Jake paul is somebody who acts Smart but actually Dumb.
“Student loans aren’t something to complain about”<br>Sounds about European
Idk if this applies to every school In america but in my school they have financial classes you can take
Fun fact: Jake Paul is racist
If Jake Paul gets into the flight I&#39;m in, I&#39;m gonna get down cause I don&#39;t wanna be in the same level as he is.
Man i am grateful that i meet Pewd channel few years ago instead of JP
This came out on my birthday
He should do an update video on this now
So nice to see Coffeezilla giving exposure to smaller channels like PewDiePie
sell Jake Paul for peanuts
Took me 11 months to realize that they probably just made up their names there..  BILLY GENES?? BEN DOVER??
why is jake paul literly my friend
Let me tell you something something you need in life is you all know it had you all hate it M A T H
I recently did an interest group project for school, and I’m just imagining students in the future having to research a group, and they choose to do their project on Jake Paul’s Financial Freedom Movement. Smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
The cumbersome currency aerobically paste because lawyer neatly hop times a uneven egypt. sulky, disillusioned crayfish
School is expensive, but. So. So. So. So. So. Necessary. Don&#39;t listen to this walking baby boy. <br><br>A bully. Plain and simple. <br><br>Period.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=55">0:55</a> did he even attend math classes? 39.99*12=479.88$ which is less than 480

That thumbnail though...
That&#39;s literally communism
It&#39;s really nice that Pewds paused the jake paul video and translated cause it was really necessary!
Jack paul
Imagine putting that you went through a course hosted by Jake Paul on a resume
Best financial advice for college: stop taking useless degrees!

Prince ea is a good inspirational person go to his YouTube channel
Jake paul gave me motivation to go to an asylum begus of listening to his everyday bro song i got mental problems
LMFAO they hiden the 100 subs they have
We really do have a shitty school system here tho
Isn&#39;t there a class for Financially advantages in school. 🤷
the best part is when u go to film school most of the teachers are retired Directors, producers editors and many more sharing what they have learnt.
well...<br>He&#39;s gonna fight Connor McGregor now so...
Update the website is still up some how 😂
This didn&#39;t age well.
Jake is sure inspiring me to make a movement, a bowel movement.
Why jake Paul dogs are throwing money

FFW Is basically be taught the right way from someone who dropped out of high school

Jake Paul: &quot;I was the smartest in class&quot;<br>Also Jake Paul: <b>*uses &quot;...&quot; Instead of commas (,), proper grammar, or punctuation. Doesn&#39;t know the difference between &#39;there&#39; and &#39;their&#39;*</b> 👁️👄👁️👍

Jake is literally the most Ohio person I’ve ever seen <br>(I know he’s from there)
Bro
Getting made fun of by THE biggest Youtuber has to be the single largest L that Jake Paul will ever take, and there isn&#39;t anyway he could ever respond seriously.
Anyone here after he got sued almost 6 times ,and look who’s talking about financial advice.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😎
I suggests he takes a graphic design and branding course or hires a specialist cuz his Windows movie maker clip look like sheise.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=271">04:31</a> bruh  thats his team 10 squad.

Student loans in the us is very different than europe.

Boo jake

He’s a snake
Pewd&#39;s literally a guy who came from zero to the most handsome face 2020. and he&#39;s never tried to teach any body anythin. jake paul is creating a platform for a bunch of amatures with no success to teach our youngsters. schewpid
Frick ing YouTube keeps doing unskippable ads
I used to do stand up comedy. <br>When i hear <br>“Ideas are shit without execution”<br>I hear alot of retards that dont have that much life experience. <br>I should know im a retard myself.
Either Jake Paul is a being of pure cringiness, or he is a comic genius and we didn&#39;t even realize it yet.
No pay

I like how they turned off sub count and haven’t uploaded in 9 months
I agree about student loans. People should stop dig piling on the “don’t take a loan you can’t afford” because so many people WANT an education (i.e. kid who wants to be a veterinarian) but you’re telling them that if they can’t afford it, they don’t deserve education. I think some reform is needed on how little people can afford school in some countries, but shitting on people who have debt to STUDY, to better themselves for a better future isn’t helpful. I think it sucks that so many people are in debt for education, but I think people should be aware of how fair and low interest student loans tend to be. And yes, using it correctly is necessary, same with scholarships and any money.
I enrolled my son in FFM and he learned how to scream loudly<br>And make shitty content
Jake Paul: &quot; I was the smartest kid in the classroom&quot;<br>Me: soooo, you were alone all the time?

wow is someone so dumb to pay money for this &quot;movement&quot;
Mans name was &quot;Ben Dover&quot; XD
When Jake Paul said he was the smartest kid in class was the point where I realized something. If he was the smartest kid in class, why does he make so many dumb choices? And yes Ik this video is roughly 7-8 months old XD
PewDiePie 🙌🙌🙌😂😂😂<br>Nice

Jake Paul  : &quot;Are you with me?&quot;<br><br><br>PewDiePie : &quot;I&#39;m ok, thank you though&quot;

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=95">1:35</a> Maybe in Europe, but in the U.S. the student loan program tricked the government into allowing it to do whatever it wants, including increasing the interest rate and abolishing a citizen&#39;s right to file for bankruptcy against them.
we need a vid about jake paul boxing
your not wrong but the us student loan is not a super easy nice handout it’s a life sentence for a good portion of the people who do it because even with a diploma you can’t find a job at least not one that uses your degree

i think i saw a body language expert on tv say that when someone is talking and they push their tongue out like that, its a sign of deception or something.

Even Logan passed Jake in those 3 years and now has 2M subscribers more than Jake. <br>Personally, I like PewDiePie and Logan Paul much more than Jake Paul.

It kind of sounds like Jake paul heard boyinabands song &quot;don&#39;t stay in school&quot; where Dave talks about rethinking the education system, and then just ran with idea to make money.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=100">1:40</a> I think student loans really are pretty shite in the US compared to what we have here in Europe.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=97">1:37</a> In the UK it&#39;s the cheapest loan you can take. Tbf at this point it doesn&#39;t even count as a loan anymore as the repayment works more like a tax than an actual loan. In the US however student loans are an actual nightmare. In the UK loans are given by a governmental association, in the US it&#39;s given by banks. Banks have a higher incentive to monetize on loans as they&#39;re not publicly funded, therefore in the US it is actually a nightmare. Also to go to a good uni in America the tuition fee is ridiculously high. But Yh, don&#39;t take financial advice by the Youtuber that burns stuff in his pool and breaks lockdown to host parties.
jake: r u with me <br>felix: im ok ty though<br>me: lol i dont know why this is soo funny to me.

What a coincidence i am currently studying the lesson of quadratic formula in my class and they said the quadratic formula lol
i hate it when people like jake say &quot;quite college, quite school&quot; they say it like youre life will magically change into the better. What do you think theyll do? i bet theyd just sit and play video games all day. Besides, a lot of what you learn in school helps you learn how to think, not just how to use fractions.
The sollution is to remove you jake

Does Jake Paul not realize those “9 to 5 cookie cutter jobs” are necessary? Where does he think his electricity comes from? Or the mansion I’m sure he has. It’s called hard work.
The messages that Jake Paul is sending out is just so stupid.
If you are go to pay all this money to get a job, just pay for college at that point tbh, you would get way more qualified people and more bang for you buck compared to this shit man tbh
So many of these fucking finance gurus, its so annoying
You&#39;d know how worthless an education system is if you&#39;re in a 3rd world country

I am in no way trying to defend Jake Paul or attack PewDiePie but I disagree with PewDiePie on one thing; student loans actually can give you really bad debt and I don’t think student loans are a good idea just go to a cheaper college
Holy balls, Jake Paul is such ceiling gang
Guys we should promote kindness in the comments...we&#39;ve roasted Jake a lot now let&#39;s say something positive about him. ill start...<br><br>Well for one, Jake is....<br>Jake.....<br>I mean he&#39;s a.....<br><b>Well, shit this is hard</b>
I like how he&#39;s trying to advertise financial freedom to his followers who were grinding in kindergarten
PewDiePie has probably never taken student loans in America.

Your take on student loans is 100% wrong, unfortunately.
Jake Paul: Financial Freedom. Are you with me?<br><br><b>2 months later</b><br><br><br>News: Jake Paul filmed looting, but denies being a part of it.
I know I&#39;m a little late to the party, but here in America, student loans are absolutely NOT the best loan available. You should do everything possible to avoid taking out a student loan, especially from a companies like Sallie May.
The video aged, just forwards
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=395">6:35</a> 70% off $480 is $144...couldn&#39;t he have just put $499 instead of $480?!! dumbass Jake Paul
you actually got this right pewdiepie .. just summarized it said what we all thought about, they&#39;re bunch of nobodies scammers ... i heard he went to jail thu ...
Wow all I can say is fuckin wow! Jp is a genius LMFAO
The internet will rejoice once Jake Paul&#39;s YT channel gets deleted or banned.<br>I can&#39;t w8.
Damn, I’m glad Jake Paul went to MrBeast’s house. ”Subscribe to PewDiePie”, MrBeast said, lo and behold what a feast of roasting here I found.🙇‍♂️

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=138">2:18</a> , Those are Manny Khoshbin&#39;s Mclaren P1 and Mclaren Senna, and I bet Jake stole that footage.
JAKE PAUL AS IN FAKE MAUL
Damn he really did enroll himself..... Waau the dedication I --
People like Jake Paul basically think that teachers have to be your parents.
&quot;maybe if you stayed in school jake you&#39;d know what a dozen is&quot;
what a<br><br>C L O W N
I understand Pewds but I&#39;d have to disagree on student loans, they&#39;re government controlled so you don&#39;t have options on rates, plus the rates are some of the worst out of any loans in the u.s. He is a swed boy so he might not know about that.
When jake said, “bdhehendhdoalwkp.” I was touch

Pewdiepie is wrong about Student Loans, but then again he is from Sweden where Post ED is much more affordable. The US system is different.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=600">10:00</a> is jake forming a cult 😂 😳🤨🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
Can you please make another video about this ?
&quot;Billy Gene&quot; inspired from Michael Jacksons Billie Jean?
Jake Paul is like a cartoon personification of the worst of US tween pop culture. He actually had too much affirmation.
Jake Paul just gave me motivation to go to school.
Jake Paul asking us if we&#39;re joining him or not while flirting with the viewers is something I didn&#39;t know we needed........
the FBI apparently
This aged well.
&quot;Our generation is better than this&quot;<br>Uh— sir I cant do my taxes
Who’s here after fbi raided his house
Cody ko: <b>fake insulting jake</b><br>Jake: <b>yelling at him like a baby</b><br><br>Meanwhile...<br>PewDiePie: <b>actually insulting him</b><br>Jake Paul: “see now that’s different”
Has this aged well?
Just getting raided by FBI..!
I’ve made $36,000 with $3,000 investment, because I had good guidance with @Carlos_1uptrades on IG. with his teachings and trading skills, I’ve had nothing but continued success indeed  it’s beyond eye opening

Felix &quot;billy gene&quot; <br><br>me &quot; BILLY GENE IS NOT MY LOVER SHE JUST A GIRL WHO THINKS THAT I AM THE ONE!!!!&quot;
Bruh wtf does he think the parents are supposed to do?
Felix went to school in Sweden so I don’t think the student loans are as bad as in the US
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=157">2:37</a> the sound is cream dropping from cake game in purble palace  :D
up to no good
I saw this on dangelos channel and it&#39;s still as funny
lazarbeam is better
I wish jake paul have ligma
Jake Paul lucked out and got rich from doing dumb shit for views while his manager and accountant manage his financial information. I think we all know Jake Paul is 47/46 chromosomes when it comes to numbers and not wasting money on 10 grand shoes and Lamborghinis
Literally profiting on telling kids school is bad.
Why are we waiting for our lunch in the que if the dinner lady isn’t Nick Crompton?

Why are we even learning capitalism when teacher isn&#39;t even George Washington
That thumbnail looks like the love child of Jake Paul and Sir Stevo Timothy! 😂
If school is so useless then where did the experts on their team get their education?
Jake kinda looks like an off brand rat from flushed away
I like how that cringe pauler says &quot;Fuck Ksi&quot; in front of kids lmao.
Lol, that&#39;s coffeezilla at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=487">8:07</a>
Jake Paul&#39;s talking about how you don&#39;t need to go to college or high school but didn&#39;t all the experts probably go to college to get a degree in economics or business or marketing🤔
Bro we are forced to take one year of finance courses in high school like dude you saved it for senior year and then dropped out without taking it
Who else got ocd when they were throwing money off the ledge and one got stuck in the crack on the ledge?
Jake Paul = scammer
For some reason I thought Drew Gooden made this video
Felix hates drama <br>Also Felix........
Wow jake barely sounds like a toddler learning how to talk here
Hey pewds , after corona u should colab w mr beast

Screw you.
Take it out of your list of roasting Jake Paul cause he is ROASTED.
I’m from Britain so I’m just like don’t live in shitty shooting range America
Jake is a wannabe prince ea
It&#39;s ironic that the one person who lucked into fame and wealth by the popularity of his brother and everyone else around him is also the person trying to educate people on becoming successful by themselves.
A good rule for choosing your degree is that the cost does not exceed your starting salary. So if you&#39;re gonna make $50,000/yr your first year out of school, your degree should be less than that.
in america student loans are a lot different
i am not joking i thought the thumbnail was <b>logan</b> cuz of how big the nose was-
Hm yes I want life advice from someone who dropped out of high school
Why are learning about history when the teacher isn’t the every person to ever exist

He&#39;s back with Alissa...

Gotta love pewds!
our generation now: civil war time
On the channel, they turned off comments, likes and dislikes, and the amount of subs.
Heh, just saw a GFUEL X pewdiepie Ad.

So I guess Jake made it out of this squeaky clean, haven&#39;t seen any news about this in a while.
Lol financial freedom starts with a personal budget not a movement
His face in the thumbnail 😂😂😂

Hi
Uploaded On My B-Day 🎉🎉🎉🎉<br>👏😁😁😁
Idk about other countries but the US education system is pretty bad in a lot of ways but the last thing we need is Jake Paul making the issue a joke
I love pewdiepie roasting Dr Phil guests and Jake Paul
The Paul brothers are definitely growing differently. Logan has been a lot more mature in the past few months and i admire that very much. On the other hand, jake is still a big pillock.
Why we sittin’ in class learning about “space” when the teacher isn’t a planet
I’m ok, thank you.
&quot;student loans are one of the most fairest loans you can get&quot;<br><br>Are you f*cking kidding me?? The interest rate is 11%

Just visited the site. They removed all affiliates - i&#39;m a bit surprised actually.. Thought for sure, that Disney was working with him.. Guess not
Jake Paul followers already have financial freedom

Jake paul talks about education. He didn&#39;t go to college
I literally took a financial class

Jake Paul eboy confirmed!!!!
We aren’t sitting in class right now because of the pandemic lol
god I can&#39;t stand entrepreneurs. I just want to beat them to death when they use buzzwords like, &quot;motivate, hustle, take advantage of, just gotta do it, don&#39;t let, 9 to 5.&quot; <br><br>Entrepreneurs will never understand the satisfaction of starting in the work force, and slowly moving up and having a secure job with a company that pays its worker to be there, have benefits and vacation. Everything they do is a huge fucking scam and 99/100 times they just get lucky and happen to score and feel like it can be repeated. Just because they&#39;re rich now doesn&#39;t meant they <i>made</i> that happen. They just <i>happened</i> to fall in that situation.<br><br>EDIT: You will never make millions or even 6 digits as an entrepreneur. Odds are, you won&#39;t even break $35k/yr. Its a bullshit business
(^u^)
Why are we learning about math if the teacher isnt even a calculator?!
Jake Paul is Billy McFarland but worse and somehow is able to get a pass every time he scams
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=157">2:37</a> WAS THAT A PURBLE PLACE SOUND EFFECT??!!

That&#39;s literally a pyramid scheme that&#39;s like you pay a &quot;small&quot; price of $100 and you turn that in to $1000 that&#39;s stupid.
How come we are sitting in class learning about Math when we have calculators on our phones?
How come we are sitting in Gym class and the teachers name is Frank?
How come we are in class learning about history when the teacher is a woman?
Jake Paul and Tai Lopez should team up!

Jail.
I mean, I went to college and I got a degree and I work in Switzerland. I have two kids and a wife, so I&#39;d say that going to college and getting a job is working out pretty well for me.
How did people fall for his scam
@jakepaule and his channel is ded
LOOTING THATS WHAT HES UPTO
I know what FFM Stands for now. Freaked Financial Movement.
<b>He’s up in jail</b>
Isn’t it illegal to falsely market something and make people pay for it and not follow up on it
if pewds joined this just to make fun of the rituals and secret formula, then Jake would be bragging that they got Pewdiepie to join

Damn you pewds, i cant able to laugh, cause something is wrong with my health, but damn you, for making me laugh🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This video makes me want to subscribe
The thing that gets me is he&#39;s saying his generation is smarter.<br>So far we&#39;ve seen people telling others to stop getting vaccinated,<br>we&#39;ve seen people talk about the dangers of eating meat,<br>we&#39;ve also seen people in his generation decide they shouldn&#39;t vote for people just because they are white straight and male.<br>Not looking too smart there Jake. Might wanna reconsider what you&#39;re saying.
not at pewdiepie having bts recommended-
قول الله
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=422">7:02</a> get exposed jake Paul
Ok.... So here&#39;s the thing according to Jake Paul everyone is just supposed to drop out of schools and just be an influencer but what I don&#39;t get it is if everyone is an influencer who the fuck is going around watching these influencers. To become an influencer you need an audience and you won&#39;t have one if everyone is going around making their own content.
jake pauls generation is boomers
Why are kids sitting in class learning about life cycles when the teacher isn’t even giving birth in front of them?
May 2020: jake  (a multi millionaire) is now looting

BEN DOVER his parents are weird
What is Jake Paul really up to: LOOTING!
good news. cops can now arrest him under suspicion. entitled white youtuber needs jail time. ridiculous
Wouldnt be surpised if jake paul copyright strikes this video to hide the fact that he actually <b>will</b> take down the website after getting enough money from scamming others.
all he cares about is fame and money, nothing else
Jake Paul stole iPhones and sold them in highschool... Don&#39;t think he&#39;s changed that much, guys a dirtbag
A youtuber is a real job. All YouTubers have an IQ except for the Paul Brothers
What’s jake doing these days? <br><br>Looting
Wow
the cringe xD
hey guys quit trying to work to get to college and work on giving me money cuz ya know that helps your life 10 folds think about how much that will impact your life
Came back here after Graham exposed the scam of Jake Paul
Why
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvvfSvg2bQ&amp;t=410">6:50</a> at the top is that meant to say &quot;branding with jak&quot; or jake
Jake Paul is a moron you can see it in his eyes
the funny thing that jake paul never went to collage
He makes good points American schools are so messed up the teach you how to how to meat dead line and be a worker drone
The brah sound gets me every time maaan
sry
Well Jake, there are people who pay their taxes by having a career. You get a career studying subjects in school that, well, some people aren’t going to use but others in the class will, and also, that film teacher didn’t make a film but knows how to create a film but just decided to teach people about how to, just because he hasn’t made a film doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to.<br><br>Smh I’m 14 years old and know better than Jake Paul, I’m not even American and know how to speak better than him, like seriously Jake you shouldn’t had dropped out of school, kids in the future will know how to criticize you because they did finish their education.
Pewdiepie and ksi roast jake <b>good content</b>
