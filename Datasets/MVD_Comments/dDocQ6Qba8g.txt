holy moly
this got me emotional in the first part, really cool video guys
di solawatin aja ya kaka
Will is it? Please shave that neck beard!
This is awesome luxury memorable video
Review watch...
It&#39;s filled with red flags. C&#39;mon.
And it looks awesome tbh
Pretty sure they can make more than 900 devices since they are using such a small piece.
This could easily be bull
I&#39;ll buy that for a dollar 🤑
I feel blessed just by watching this video.
so this is iphone 14 pro?
Steve jobs pubes in this phone!
Caviar is basically Escobar except it fells more rich and its real and just amazing
I have titanium inside my arm
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
This is how they seed our minds to be their economic slaves...run baby run 🤢
The turtle neck fabric is most likely fake because the phone claiming to have a piece of apple one is fake
Please.... stop making those stupid videos .... you are damaging your reputation .
And its already outdated 🤣
I could put any piece of cloth on a phone and tell it&#39;s steve jobs. Seriously?
steve jobs is a arab
Caviar, every type of sh..t a person doesnt need😂 cool tho,..for the average millionaire
iPhone 13 has a 4 cameras
Thanks to that, Steve&#39;s jobs widow is making more money on his death 😒
so beutyfull a real art
nice hat
is the iPhone 5s silver but the gold fingerprint ring is a limited edition?
the moment when someone said lew croft i freaked out
Soon they gonna put used toilet paper in the phones and sell them
I have the first three iPhones and the headset you show are not the original ones..not important..
cool
This is kinda weird.
Sooo... Where is the shirt
Apple fans: 🥵😩😝🥶😱
that&#39;s weird af
Vanity
The cut unit monthly look because foot uncommonly challenge across a gorgeous peru. rare, equable loan
could be just a piece of random black fabric stuck in there and the real shirt they buyed at auction just keped there untill it becomes  real expensive
ayyyyy Canoopsy
Imagine you dropped it and cracked the screen
They could have marketed it like &quot;Steve Jobs DNA is in this iPhone&quot;. Such a wasted material.
Steve Jobs would sue whoever was responsible for this lol.
It doesn&#39;t look good  love APPLE APPLE FAN
this iphone is stupid.
for $6700 does it come with the ability to upgrade to the next Iphone, or are you locked in?
You act like this man was a god. Literally a dude that helped make a cell phone.
Rich ppl just want personalized items to feel richer than everyone else
The incandescent mimosa suprisingly fire because paper partly watch apropos a obedient belt. sedate, befitting eyeliner
next product: Steve Jobs bleeding skin iPhone
looks like shit lol
Me: watches on android<br><br>Cool
They put a titanium plate on the back to make the back flush with the cameras, then decided <br>to put a protruding logo on the back??
WOW! I NEED THIS!
Apple: What to do next... okay I know what will be best for company, since we don&#39;t have any new designs and all, let&#39;s tell companies to put pants inside phone :)<br>Apple: who&#39;s pants btw<br>Apple: why do you care, anyone would do, duh
This is kinda touching. Imagine the fabric once Steve  wore is immortalised in the device he made. How touching is that. I am an avid Android user but seeing this makes me feel sad and happy at the same time.
Ok you did the showcase. Now do a durability test and crush it.
all these legends like Ali, Frazier, Jackson, Elvis, Monroe all pale in comparison to steve jobs?<br>Guess what the only one that doesn&#39;t fit is steeve tho.
So I kinda hate everything about this phone’s existence?  On the other hand I used to collect baseball jersey cards. Lol. Capitalism makes bitches of us all.
Why does will always seem like he hates your guts. I love it.
this guy flexing his phone while i as an intellectual know that my dick is exclusively rare to me.
ew
I have mixed feelings about this.
1 year anniversary for this video tomorrow!
Did that cost $30 million?
Ah, the sweet times when you got a charger with the Iphone
That’s kinda fucking disrespectful how they are making profit over clothing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=356">5:56</a>, of course we&#39;re gonna have a charger, hahahahahahahahhaha
Wow cool, now put a case over it.
who buys rare memorabilia that can be worth a lot to people just to cut it up into pieces.
Say what you will about iPhone nowadays, but you have to give credit where it&#39;s due. iPhone is the reason we have smartphones at all.
Hey It’s not one of 9 there are 9 million because martians love IPhone 11 pros ,Please you are acting stupid
UBT: Wow the rarest iphone 11 in the universe<br>Willido: uh, emm.., yeah, oooh
that&#39;s kinda weird
First of all “OMG”<br>Second : you had a forehead, you had a chin ...<br>*me holding a 2016 iPhone right now:<br>I still have forehead and chin ...
imagine putting a case on that😂😂😂😂
Its all about money....😣
You gave the spoiler in the video name itself

I wanna see the muhammad ali one
Wow! Fuck it
Kinda weird but ok.
Does it smell like moth balls.
He signed in 2011 before he died a phone that came out in 2019. If they did that with Iphone 4 or 5.... Ok, I get it.... But this?! Who is that dumb??? 😳🤷🏻‍♂️😒
Getting this notification after 11 months
rip stive jobs......... igess
time to do some droptests
It&#39;s $6k on the site tho
who even buys these for 7 grands😐 ugh
Birthday
Turns out this is the new iPhone 12 😂😂
Imagine dropping it and ist breaks 🤯
2009: Steve job&#39;s phone in your pants.<br><br>2019: Steve job&#39;s pants in your phone.
Next up: <b>Mark Zuckerberg’s underwear is in this phone</b>
Nice phone
Its really funny for me, because Steve jobs in his early days was infamous among his colleagues for not showering for months. I just like to Imagine someone having this phone and the cloth in there is a piece of Steve job&#39;s stinky unwashed clothes lmao.
Who else is seeing this in October 2020
Only 8 gigabytes!!! Crazyyy
Ok... So there were 9 pieces of his clothes left after they burned Steve Jobs?
I can&#39;t ever tell if you&#39;re just very genuine or very condescending as fuck.
We miss Steve Jobs
i cant wait to be famous so people can buy an iPhone with my pubic hair inside it.
The background music like some kind of casket choosing ceremony is going on
weird flex but ok
Isn&#39;t this what the catholic&#39;s do to Jesus?
iPhone 12 pro, lol
So stupid
what is the music name?
U$A
It includes a... CHARGER?
who is Steve Jobs
Came here for Steve Job&#39;s shirt, stayed for the 1st gen iPhone
so all the phones we use are naked?
Jerryrigeverything will check if it is real titanium
Oh MY GODH MIND BLOWN AWAY FROM PlANET EARTH
From where does get it ???????
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=125">02:05</a> woooow<br>And what now
Very, very small piece. You could just take one of his sweater fabric and cover the back with it
Customized by caviar in russia ?? What this means ?
No matter how much you hate or love Apple and their phones...Steve Jobs was a gift to the world. A legend.
Honestly I like this design than the original one.
Idk but that background music making this video emotional kinda.
This is creepy as fuck.
I&#39;m thinking it has a good portion of shirt then I see that little speck of dust on there.  Not worth it
They have a whole turtleneck sweater, 9 phones but still put a tiny tiny piece in the phone
Thats awesome
your name
Lol well I know that caviar boxes aren&#39;t cheap thats only reason we know caviar for there boxes not there phone
I wouldn’t even take the product lol I respect him to much to have the phone
That&#39;s cool and all, but who would use it because it&#39;s so rare and expensive?
This is cheap for caviar standards
&quot;This is my new iphone for $120 000 wbu?&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=130">2:10</a> music name plz😊
They should make the iPhones look like that it looks more sleek
Omg why he sound like cardi B
It&#39;s enough to make a man cry
Thats not corona friendly
i can imagine someone seeing the imei and reporting the phone as stolen so it gets blacklisted
I still use my old iPhone 4s
BRING BACK THE IPHONE 5 DESIGN WITH THE LARGE SIZE
7k would pay my car off I’m dead 😵
It would have looked better if the entire apple logo (including the leaf) was made of the turtle neck
How much is that
O have one 2🥺<br>I have 02-09
I have Steve jobs on my phone I just went on google and downloaded a picture of him
Ok
Hi
It’s beautiful
If you are a father and have a family of six in which you buy every member of your family a premium iPhones it is a much better investment to buy this iPhone and get them all some other phone. This is without a doubt going to be worth a ton of money one day.
How’d they get ahold of one of his shirts though...
meanwhile in china: cloth iphone case: $ 10
Who in the world would want a dead man&#39;s piece of cloth in their device?! And that too having the same software. And for 6,700$ they don&#39;t even give you Airpods?!?!?
🤮
Rest of world-DD/MM/YYYY<br>Russia-YYYY/MM/DD
Can I have the certificate I like the holigrafic sticker
If steve was still alive, this bullshit wouldn’t be going on with apple today
that actually looks pretty cool ngl
Do you think you could give us a iphone doesnt matter what one just one iphone i have not had the pleasure of owing one
O hi bob, oh my phone? This is a dead mans shirt how about you
Why ?<br><br>Just why?
How did they shove a shirt in there?😂😂
The music is so good. I absolutely love how it matches the class of the phone.
What we wanted vs what we needed<br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m not telling you which one you needed and wanted
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=535">8:55</a> the flash of iPhone 11 pro max is bigger than the camera of 1st iPhone!
Lew: it’s not worth comparing it to a standard iPhone 11 Pro <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=381">6:21</a><br><br>Me: really lew
Niggas paying 6k+ for a tiny pieces of this dude&#39;s sweaty ass shirt 🤣 it&#39;s baffling
ther no airpods
Its is dream for me
Can you give that phone please
I observed the background music a bit more than the grand gadget... its simply amazing...
they hsould have modded in a headphone jack
just received mine in the mail. pretty nice, I only wish the entire apple logo was filled with the shirt
now imagine that phone caught  fire
Wow ! For that price it&#39;s amazing !!!
gimmie the phone and il give you steve jobs ashes
2050: we made an iPhone with a peace of an iPhone in it.<br>Price: 100,000
2019: we made an iPhone with 3 cameras.<br>Apple workers: nah<br>2020: we made an iPhone with a peace of shirt on it.<br>Everyone:genious.
If I had it I&#39;d feel like it&#39;s too rare to use it.
Thats propably just a random black fabric lol
Thank god they did not put a piece of his😂😂 underware..
Imagine Tim Cook using this
i want it so bad i even dont have my own phone 😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
iPhone sucks
Imagine if Apple started to sell this instead of the things we get in memory of Steve Jobs

These CRAZY expensive luxury phones got me thinking. Maybe it’s already being done, but imagine opening a company that doesant just sell off already customised phones, but rather asks for a potential customer to bring in their phone and then discuss the design, price material and so on. I dunno, if I had the motivation, money, education and if I was of age I would fs open such a company, but I’m not gonna talk about something I have very little knowledge about, but just imagine. U could spend like 5 thousand or something like that for like crazy high luxury, titanium, gold accents, sapphire and so on. Or, maybe u would spend a hundred, and get something like silver or other “cheaper” metal sides, a custom ceramic back or like leather design or something. That would be awesome. <br><br>Now obviously a company like this would be hard to maintain, and it’s already clear that similar companies who make luxury variants of phones aren’t really getting that much profit, but still it would be cool. I would for sure spend like 100-300 on custom design, engravings and so on. I doubt it will ever happen, or I’m being stupid and there already is a company like that.
bang bang skeet skeet nigga
Did they dig up his grave
it looks like an original iphone
holy moly 😱😱😱 i want that beatles thingy!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=590">9:50</a> it does not cuz i was born that year
Rip jobs... but this is absolutely stupid
thats how apple should of made camera on back instead of that glass they put around the cameras xD
only for steve jobs simps
Me:*gets the phone* <br><b>later</b><br>Also Me:  OH MY GOD I CANT BEILEIVE I GOT STEVE JOBS SHIRT IN THIS PHO- <b>drops phone in toilet</b>
Holy moly
Imagine if you drop it and the apple logo breaks and you lose the fabric
That shirt peice is prolly worth 5 cents
I need No 06/09
This ugly ass phone is insult to Steve job and his family.
Man, the cloth piece&#39;s so small they could&#39;ve literally made thousands of these editions instead of just 9...
So it&#39;s for Steve job simps?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Or Apple simps
the title doesn’t make sense
MKBHD gets the phone *Puts DBrand skin on it
I want please please
iPhone 11: I’m the best iPhone while the limited edition: hmmm I’m sure ur not the best phone
Well i never get ppl who buy iphone you can get soo much more with half price on android
it goes deeper<br><br><br>Gun shots in my game
Rick: Let me call down a friend <br><br>Friend: &quot;This phone <b>is</b> historical and valueable the phone is athurorized, so this would sell for $7,000&quot;.<br><br>Rick: &quot;Best I can do is $50, this is a big risk I&#39;m willing to take&quot;.
Oh wow, Steve Jobs&#39;s blouse is in there. I think I peed myself a bit..
author people had gold iPhone  buyyers:man this is the most expensive iPhone in the world<br>And Lew had no.1 , the Legendary the luxury , the memorial, and the the  icon of iPhone 11 pro
Why the fuck is this being allowed to happen? Tech will go obsolete in a few more years..

“holy moly”<br>   <br>               -Unbox Therapy

Yeah what if it has battery problems? There’s goes an expensive rare phone “lost” by Apple employees and mysteriously sold on an auction.
i feel so sad that steve jobs is not alive anymore. He was only 56 when he died. I feel so sad thinking abt him. 😢😢😢
imagine it’s just a piece of goodwill clothing

2016: buying a phone for entertainment<br>2019: buying a phone because the owner of apple has its piece of clothing in it
But why?
👎
Can we just take a minute to soak in that how stupid this is
I have one word to describe this!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.Meh
You should get the fabric from the phone and get the dna from it and preserve it so later on you can clone Steven jobs
The amount of shit his grand kids will find in his attic will be ridiculous.
If this isnt the shittiest ever  1000 dollars for and ugly ass for with a piece of a turtle neck in the apple logo.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Warning! This commenter is an apple user.
thats cute
Imagine how better iPhones would be like if he was still alive
Now thats going to be worth more than it wight in Diamonds One Day, I have A kidney going begging if you need it, For Number 9 of 9 of the above iPhone 11 Pro &amp; and you pay the surgery Bill.
Imagine flexing this to ur homie
Imagine if jerry rig everything durability tested it
Hes dead
Steve Jobs is overrated. Glorification at its best.
I can’t believe this was 7 months ago
It&#39;s the rarest of the nine cause its the first
Did u guys knew its 01/09?
Steve Jobs wore a metallic plate shirt? Wow!
give man and i will be god😂😂
The first “phone” I had was an iPod and all my siblings had them. I once tried to get into my sisters iPod so many times I locked her out of it. I then got an iPhone 5 (I think) that was used by my cousin and then my sister (same one) before me. It worked for about a week before shutting down. That was many years after I had an iPod and then a few years after that phone I got a 6 and i had it for about a year and half before it shut down and would just go from 100 to 0 and then shut off every few seconds you had it on. Then we got a 6s + and it worked for about 2 weeks before having the same problem as my last phone.<br><br>Now, I have the iPhone XR and it hasn’t messed up yet
Hi grandpa still uses a iPhone 3gs my grandpa says he buys the iPhone 3gs around 1000 bucks
This video was in my recommended for months and thought it was clickbait but it wasn’t lol.
Egg
If it&#39;s a complete shirt.... why they only took 9 of such tiny pieces???
I know others appreciate Steve so much more than I and for that I am disappointedly sad. I wish I was born sooner to feel and understand how groundbreaking his innovations were. Even though I&#39;m an Android guy, Apple has my respect.
That’s kinda gross
Christ, they do everything trying to sell their overpriced shit. Steve Jobs was a evil bastard, hate Apple, hate steve jobs.
Cost is $6700<br><br>Me: WHERE ARE THE DAMN AIRPODS?????!!!!!!!!
ill be honest i want less of will
Next product: Bill gates’ hair is in this PC
Hii I am from India and a student currently studying in class 10th and really have a dream to wear an apple watch but can&#39;t afford it if you can give me one  like your old or if you have any extra used one,ghan also it will be really very very thankful and helpful to you
Such a weird flashback. I was only 1 when the first iPhone came out🤯
i watched this video and said hes stupid then i noticed the jays hat
I’ll have the original iPhone anytime
So beautiful
One day you should sell phones with patches of your underwear embedded in them.
That&#39;s just creepy
ya, next caviar is gonna make a phone which has steve jobs&#39; worn underwear...
Р О С С И Я ! Р О С С И Я ! Р О С С И Я !
Model 1 of 9 with a tiny tiny piece of his black turtle neck. 🤨. What did they do with the rest of the shirt!.!?!
“Take heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.”<br>‭‭1 Chronicles‬ ‭<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=1690">28:10</a>‬ ‭KJV‬‬
No one give this phone to jerry rig everything he will probably say light scratches with a level 6 with deeper grooves with a level 7
Lets send it to gizmo slip to drop test it
Christ you’re annoying.
If you take the apple logo the iPhone will be such a bullshit
The horrible part is they&#39;re going to take it back! Why Caviar?
Wow they couldn&#39;t include black ear pod?
I’m so obsessed with the customized iPhones you get
He probably sold his car for it
The packaging screams luxury ,big up from Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪
take it to pawn stars.... &quot;ill give you 50 bucks for that, risk it might not sell, the cost of promoting ill be lucky i make profit off of it&quot;
this a new level of fetish
don’t give a fuck 😅😅😅
All phones 4g such 5g is the best
It a cover
Which boose u had before
What&#39;s next? Bottled water with some drops from Steve Jobs ass sweat? Fuck off
I just noticed, I am listening to the video with the that kind of earphones! still love the design!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=162">2:42</a> Did no one else notice that they spelt Titanium wrong on the engraving?!
wow so pretty
I want one could you buy one as a gift my birthday is coming july 21
i thought it was Apple 11 version of Google Pixel
Its sad he would never want these products from apple :(
stupid
imagine if he dropped it
&quot;Yeah there&#39;s a dead man&#39;s scrap of clothing inside the phone, you heard me&quot;
As much as I hate apple, they really were on top back then
I just like the look of the phone lol
Apparently the Michael Jackson version is full of games, so kids can play with him 1 last time
I feel like for that price you should get more of the shirt
This looks nice
1 like = 1 tribute to Sir Steve Jobs <br>😔
looks at Michael Jackson: lizard eyes
I would buy it if it’s on iphone 12 design!!!
this is iPhone 6 and iphone 11 combined
Doesn’t the titanium on the back make wireless charging no longer work...?
this concept seems a bit cult like.....
When they will give out Steve&#39;s testicles? 😂
This may be the most  luxurious phone i have ever seen
Best luxury
Will&#39;s contribution to the vid:<br>1. Yes<br>2. uh-hmm<br>3. uhh.
I need that phone😭
Holy shit.
People in 1990:2020 will have facemasks made out of steve jobs underwear..<br>2020:Iphone with a small bit...smaller than a cockroach..piece of steves Shirt....
I AM JUST WONDERING HOW DID YOU GET THIS?
get back in there, tear!
I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s a bit emotional 🍁
If I have million dollars I don’t mind buying it
one more own big guy from wylsacom channel. this channel is in russian language and usually work with apple devices!
Jesus they even have a phone with a piece of the actual titanic, a phone with a oiece of freaking mars!!!
Dude, turtlenecks have no buttons 😂😂
bring back memories..
What&#39;s the song in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=134">2:14</a>
There should include  AirPods  pro for that package .
this guy placed a $6000 Steve Jobs iPhone face down on the table
Luxury iPhone 11 pro , Caviar Caviar Caviar...........
That shirt could&#39;ve been from anyone for all we know. I could literally go to my mom&#39;s wardrobe, cut a tiny piece of her lingerie and be all like &quot;Oh this thin piece of clothing is from one of Steve Jobs used socks that he wore during one of his iPhone demos&quot; and hire some random company overseas to endorse it with a certificate of authenticity. Too easy.
So when Steve Jobs clothing is etched in an iphone, it becomes a specimen. Nice.
Can i have that phone. please
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=15">0:15</a> nice pun
My biggest dream to met Steve jobs ended in 2011😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭, but I have chance with Steve wasniack 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Imagine buying a phone customized like this and then people think you have a fake iphone
Just an option to waste a lot of money
The phone say 1/9 now the site say 1/99
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=388">6:28</a> Amazing that Unbox Therapy has an iPhone 11 that&#39;s customized for them.
I stil have an Iphone 4S in 2020, and it still works great! You want to hook me up with a new one go ahead.
Wdym
other companies are also working hard not only Apple
I have a original iPhone somewhere in storage but sadly it doesn’t turn on so oof.
Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.
That must had been the iPhone X.
The music is so fancy
We fancy.
I still miss the excitement and pleasure of holding the first ever iPhone back in 2008 ((
Three cameras and triangle Illuminati confirmed
I could imagine people looking weirdly at you using what looks like a fake iphone 11 where in fact it&#39;s thousand dollars more expensive than theirs and only 9 people in the world own them...
I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s really amused or just plain sarcastic 😅
How would we know it&#39;s fabric from a shirt that Steve Jobs wore/owned? It might be piece of a sock from a Russian Cop.
I miss Steve Jobs😭
At which point are we going to start worshipping a statue of the man? Lets just cut to the point.
don&#39;t remember watching this video, however there is a like already O_O
Who the fuck would buy that? I&#39;d like to see an actual idiot who bought and owns that phone 😂 Do we have any of them here?
Please give me a iphone x max and iphone 11 pro I want to give it to my brother
You guys have to get over with it. It is third party customisation not directly from apple
No poserme sa 🤣 kto rozumie mojmu komentu? 😝
Who cares of signature. We still use a cover for damage protection 😉😉
😂😂😂😂funny t-shirt😂😂part
Nonsense  never needs this.we demand ,Good camera,Better price <br>Better software of course,That&#39;s all...

Im actually getting sick from this iphone... its grows
Does will even speak English
Imagine dropping this
love you iphone
Besok saya beli dua, jangan sedih !!
For $6700 you could probably buy one of his actual shirts and an iPhone 11 pro separately
Idk how a shirt can fit in an iPhone but ok
Funny how everyone is concern about steve, and fail to notice the titanium body,, wowwwww titanium phone ,, apple should consider making special titanium phone
if Steve Jobs <br>where alive that is what the iPhone 11 Pro
Rich bitch !
This is a new kind of necrophilia!
Should have got model 6/9
It could be from his underwear lol wtf cares. That some crazy cult shit
Jerryrigeverything: hold my mohs scale.... scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7.
Ah yes, part of him (his belongings) can rest eternally in the Fisher Price of mobile devices. How fitting. Jobs was a fucking asshole. A smart one, but an asshole nonetheless.
Anyone who likes and supports apple is a complete retard.
Oke blue jays :))
Do voodoo with it and trap his soul into a cursed iPhone and let him talk tru siri
😍
Can i have a iphone 11 pro max because im big fan
:Jerryrigseverything: enters the chat
Not gonna lie that’s kinda creepy
The first iPhone in 2008: Look at this revolutionary piece of technology!<br><br>The first iPhone in 2019: Look at this cute little guy!
This iphone is not vegan
But.. he promised us not to have multiple cameras..
Next time on unbox therapy: WE HAVE ONE OF STEVE JOBS TESTICALS IN THIS PHONE
Im watching this at my iphone 4 :( can someone donate more higher version :(

Apple in 2030: Steve Jobs AI is in this iphone. Best of luck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=163">2:43</a> - Notice how they misspelled titanium
Do u ceep the iPhone or do u have to return it
who gives a crap
Im getting one
lmao that piece of shirt look like a Windows logo xD
Creepy much?<br>Randoms buy your clothes, cut it into pieces and then make it their collectibles .
I don’t even have a iPhone 11 and this dude be like
I mean no offense or anything, but it is just me or is this stupid as fuck?
Hahah now they have a limit number of 99 and not 9 hahah lost
Caviar is gonna get called out any day for claiming they made these phones with fabric from Steve job’s shirts, just to end up admitting they are fake. They’ll be owing people a whole lotta money!
This guy must be Canadian he is wearing a Toronto Bluejays hat
I didn’t know that Steve Jobs’ middle name was Paul
I can understand dildos and pocket pussies made from pornstars&#39; mould but this is some cult level shit.
I don&#39;t give a fuck about that Steve Job&#39;s tureneck.
What&#39;s does that superior Steve delivers?<br> 100gb of ram 10tb of ROM is it? 😂
Those 6500$ for a 64gb hurt a lot
Stop flexing
Ew
I figured the shirt would fill the Apple at least. Not a tiny square.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=362">6:02</a> <b>Earpods</b> ehem
Creepy, cring.
I wish I had enough money to even get an iPhone in general 😥
Can it still wirelessly charge
Drops it, then shattered
Steve jobs, the modern day Edison. Took credit for other peoples work.
What&#39;s the song that&#39;s starts to play at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=120">2:00</a>
i wonder how many phones this man has
2019: <b>iPhone has Steve jobs shirt piece 1/9</b><br>2020: <b>steve jobs dick 1in only piece you can use to hold your phone with brazzers edition</b><br>2023: <b>contains one of Steve jobs teeth 1/27</b><br>2025: <b>first apple eaten by Steve jobs</b>
wow i like it
Forget the cloth, apple needs to make those 3D apple logos in upcoming iPhones
I want Jerry Rig destroy this phone.
Lou: And if you look closely in the apple logo on the iphone 13 which is transparent on purpose, you can see a little bit of dust in there. That is right folks, Caviar has done it again! You thought a piece of Steve Jobs shirt was impressive, well they did it again! Inside the apple logo of the Iphone 13 is Steve Jobs bones, crushed into dust to fit into the logo! And look! This phone is only 1 of 5 out there as well!
Nobody <br>Corona:am I a joke to you???
Escobar Therapy should be the name of the channel
Awesome video and all but what&#39;s up with the generic sad music in the background?! Come on this is Unbox Therapy baby! Not some run of the mill channel!
I would still take a vertu over this any day.
imagine buying a $6000 phone with a small piece of clothing
Just wait until the iPhone 12 comes out
Lou Croft
Watch someone make a Steve Jobs religion
You should take it to the Walmart old phone kiosk and see how much they give for you
Ur telling me for $6700, you don’t get AirPods...... bruh
Me: <b>*buys this phone*</b><br>Also me: <b>puts on phone case</b>
This video sounds exactly like those long format TV commercials
Caviar: We make Iphones out of Caviar.
Me:is there any difference between an regular iPhone and this iPhone?<br><br>Unbox Therapy: It looks more typically like an iPhone 11 and got airpods
Anyone makes such a cover for the iPhone 11 Pro, i mean without the piece of cloth in it?
Bruh I thought it would cost more then that
I want it
I don&#39;t like current Apple, but this is awesome.
crazy mental

The shirt thing is weird,
Unbox therapy u came Nepal and I see u but cannot meet. Very sad

2021: piece of Steve&#39;s underwear in your iPad pro.
How many phones does hé even have rn
its a weird flex but ok.
That’s kinda creepy ngl
Steve Jobs vac shit in this iPhone
Winning bid for the turtleneck shirt was $2880 and they are now asking 5.7k for little piece of it.
Greetings! u found the most expensive way to ruin an iphone.
I’ve never seen him that excited
DON&#39;T EVEN OPEN IT
aye man imma get my hands on that Michael Jackson edition any day now
I would beg you to buy the michael jackson iPhone 11 pro series and show it off
Does steve have a Job? <br><br><br><br><br>no seriously who tf is that?
Wait whaaa?
An iphone 11 that looks like the design of iphone 2g is the most nostalgic and beautiful iphone iv&#39;e ever seen
I wonder if I would buy this if I had the money....<br><br><br><br><br>Naaaaaaah that’s somebodies clothing
Wait...<br>What?
Almost 7000 dollars and it still came with earbuds
Only true creeps would buy this jokes jokes
It&#39;s not even 512GB bruh
Looks like an iphone 3 with an 11 camera
Its only 64GB Storage, its kinda Small.
Kinda looking like the first iphone from the back
I love how Lew is getting excited for having Steve Jobs shirt in an iPhone and Jack sitting with his big boi laptop on the side minding his own business
I thought you didn’t like iPhone
What happens when you break the screen. Would you trust apple to fix the screen?
Wish I have one , jobs edition 😍😋
I want to buy this iPhone 11 pro version
I want to buy this iPhone 11 pro
Does the wireless  charging still work 😂
Wish i had iPhone
This is probably the first unboxing I watched from start to end. Congratulations
I need the beatles one 😁
Apple is truly a religion, and Steve Jobs has truly become its Patron Saint of Technology and Silicon Valley, if his clothing is being worshipped as a sacred relic.
Put a case in it
Hag Diya apple ne
Watched all the YouTube this was my last choice
this is awesome
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=15">0:15</a> 6 feet deeper.
Ohhh, how much I would love to get my hands on such a rare item 😍
Imagine about playing pubg mobile on this phone
We don’t give a shit
Ok. Please tell me that this is amazingly weird, right?... wtf?!
ok thats really nice
wair what
Love you Steve 😎👍
You ever wonder what Steve thinks now?
Where the heck was the shirt???
lol this was built for the 9 people in the universe who want it and can afford it.
So they&#39;re all on the moon?
That flush back looks so much better... than the stupid camera square
imagine booting android on this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=1">0:01</a> -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=108">1:48</a> does anyone know what that piano song  is called

Rest In Pieces.
Sad that they’re actually trying to make money off of his death pretty much
i love how will doesn&#39;t care at all
It’s just a piece of fabric with history.
Apple fan Boys are crazy
It took me 5 minutes to understand the title 😂
How much it cost?
Steve jobs the apple jesus
Did Any One Noticed? Why That guy Is Always On Macbook? 🤔😅
The music makes me feel like I’m playing Zelda
One of the most interesting video 👆🏽
Now hand it off to @JerrRigEverything for durability test!
Stupid ass phone. He didn’t sign that he dead. And Russia used the same metals as China to make that phone. and then marked up the price. That shirt is from Putin after he finished working out.
playing that music just made me remember of Grandpa Kitchens death😭
ThAs On plAhnhEt eArtha wIlL
Kinda creepy ngl tbh
Take a video of Xiaomi mi mix alpha!
Tbh I’d rather have the Muhammad Ali phone
That looks like blotter paper and not fabric lol
I want it now
That’s dumb.
reliquary &lt;lol&gt;
Stop playing with a dead person🤦🏼‍♂️
Bruv are u saying they want extra money cos of the shirt off Steve&#39;s back? Nah blud.
Show it to Jerry Rig Everything
For $6K you still get the earpods and not airpods
Background music was aewsome
I wonder if Putin has a caviar phone
Ooohh noo JerryRigEverything dont you ever try duravility test int this
I want his shit on my phone
Bruh nowadays you can replace the back glass of an iphone easily with a laser caviar probably used it to change the back glass
The title is so confusing
I love will
he&#39;s acting like apple invented the capacative touchscreen lmao
Victor Daniel Tu
That cloth gives me a severe case of ocd. I would remove it immediately.
I would have wanted piece 6/9.
Unbox Therapy: alright lets turn this o- WHERE IS IT?!??<br>jerry: Lets move on to the bend test.
Imagine dropping and breaking that
I have the iPhone 2G 4GB.
Jesus Cris sorry for IM saying thats the most uglyest iPhone that I ever seen
Cut the fucking bullshit and do a regular review talking nonsense all along
Why just why
Oh, that little marker mark? Are you sure that wasn’t on accident?
That is the worst tackiest looking thing I have ever seen.
Happy birthday to Steve Jobs. Rest In Peace ✌🏻
And they will piss on his legacy soon. I see somehow Apple is going down. They don’t share his dream and ideas anymore, that’s really sad. I haven’t changed my iPhone 7 cause there’s nothing that they really attract the prople with, like really do it, not just buying one cause you don’t care, but whatever, yeah, everybody is “whatever” these days.
Unbox Therapy: This is the rarest devi... WAIT WHERE IS IT?<br>Jerry: We can see scratches at level 6 and deeper groves at level 7.
what happen to all of the phone you review? do you sell it or do you just keep it?
Ijustine is pissed she didn&#39;t get to do this unboxing lol.
Thats stupid
Apple users are fucking wack lol
Not impressed
Let&#39;s just unbox an original iPhone for no damn reason but to get the video past 10 minutes!!1
Log tg c hj fvvgg
Every body : unlimited comments<br>Me: why ?
This is panty sniffing for tech bros
Lol
Jerry: <b>*Buys this phone*</b><br>Also Jerry: <b>Ok Let&#39;s see how durable this is</b>
7k for a phone that&#39;s gonna die in 5 years tops. People would buy a 10k watch because it&#39;s something that&#39;s gonna last centuries if maintained properly and it&#39;s going to maintain its price for centuries as well.<br><br>TL;DR<br><br>it&#39;s a bad investment lmao
Music?
What happens to all the devices after you unbox them ?
TAKE MY MONEY!
they did a great job keeping the camera flush with the back.....then they raise the apple logo?!?!? i assure u, steve jobs would not approve 👎
FRONT DROP, 3, 2, 1
don&#39;t see all the hype behind this guy, it seems like he was just good at PR while Wozniak did the innovating
Its funny a little bit. You buy it for review and views and then you return it. You say its a piece of steve jobs memory but yet you wont give 7000$ on it... But who should? I dont know y I watched this video honestly, its interesting but pointless.
Steve Jobs ghost just shot himself
It&#39;s a shallow cash grab by the a<br>russians and is disrespectful to Jobs memory
Who else skipped just to find him take a shirt out of the phone
2007 : Steve Jobs present Iphone starting from 499$<br>2019 : Iphone with piece from Steve Job&#39;s shirt starting from 6700$ <br>The price is very well increasing :D
This is the rarest iphone theres only 9 <br>...<br>Opens booklet <br>.. <br>beatles iphone only 1<br>...<br>Fuck it none of them matter like steve jobs
G’dam I remember getting my first iPhone 1 those ear pods used to break down all the time due to the rubber around the edge
U can literally buy the shirt off Steve jobs back what a nice guy
I call bullshit.
That&#39;s the type of box you would expect an iphone to be in, but nope.
I thought they were gonna bust that shit open to see what was inside.
Click bait who else thought that that they will listen to steve jobs
Original iPhone + iPhone 11 Pro combined
How can i geht this
This is honestly beautiful.
That&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m designing a iPad that contains a piece of Steve  tighty whities. PRE ORDERS START NOW
Bro thi is Amzing!!!!!!
2020: Samsung viewers watched this
Such a cool phone but honestly what a waste of money for a phone that&#39;ll be outdated in a few years. If someone is rich enough to get one they&#39;ll probably just get the new and improved iPhone when it comes out.
<b>wow, that shirt has a phone</b>
But why tho, it&#39;s just a phone with a shirt in it
Why the fuck would you want that
Seems so stupid to put something you&#39;d seemingly want to keep forever on a device that will become obsolete and need to be replaced in 2-3 years.
Looks like 3g
jerry rig everything take the shirt out if you have guts😂😂no offence😅
iphone is crap
Wait that actually looks good<br>That&#39;s what the 11 should have looked like
It looks crap quality up close.. just a piece of shitty looking metal stuck to the back of a regular iphone making it thicker than it already is, with 6x the price for people that have nothing to do with their money.. I guess people will buy anything nowadays..
6k at least give me AirPods pros and 100 apple gift card bro
I want it but it’s 6k
Waiting for JerryRigEverything to tear off this phone
The web page doesn’t work :(
Kinky.
Pure Shit .. Had to pay for the modification in extra!! That’s an absolute Mess 🤨🤨
How the hell?
Nah 👎🏻
just no
Why.
this isnt creepy for anyone else
Hes a guy, not a god though
Steve jobs wore shit in his mouth too.
Like, if you skipped the unboxing and just went straight to the phone.
<b>WHAT THE FUCK</b>
While this phone exists ......<br><br><br><br>Tim Cook: Hey !! Where’s my iPhone
I look like the first iPhone and the 11 phone 11 pro put together
It’s crazy people go crazy for shirt in a phone that’s wild
🙄🙄
Still no headphone jack.....
Then....<br><br><br>after heavy use the phone heats up and the shirt catches fire.
What kind of cultist you need to be to actually buy something like this.
Errererer
Please prevent Linus to get hold of one or there&#39;ll only be 8 left
Imagine it&#39;s like some store bought  shirt
You paid 6000$ and they gave you EarPods 😂 god damn
Just dont give it to jerry.
I need to iron that piece of fabric
I met Steve Jobs months before he died, if only he’d listened to Elizabeth Holmes.
Ok ok it might have Steve Jobs&#39; shirt in it but does it scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7
The fabric must be real there’s a piece of paper that says so🤥
I googled Caviar Global. Apparently they have some sick ass phones customized almost in 100 different designs.<br><br>Each going for 5K+. I guess if I made a million a year i&#39;d buy one.<br><br>Best guess. If you break one, you can send it back and they will replace all the parts for you for that price.
I want it
Total bullshit Russian fake
total fake. Jobs would never have a phone with his name etched on it
Steve Jobs would absolutely hate this
So ur basically paying about 5000 more dollars for an old piece of shirt and two slabs of metal compared to just a regular iPhone 11
Some people struggle to find ways to spend their endless money. For those people there are companies like caviar.
Thank You for your magnificent videos 🧡📱 i hope that iam one of the first on your video
$6700 For a piece of fabric the size of a pea? People are Dumb asses.
fuck this is cringy
that is so sad and creepy
6000$ and you still didn’t get airpods in the box.
Love it! Can you just take my money? Damn that is so Sexy 😍
Limited edition 1 pcs: Kobe Bryant&#39;s Jersey
I could probably get away with cutting a piece of my shirt, sticking it in a phone and claiming it’s some big shot celeb’s shirt
You can almost buy 7 galaxy folds for the same amount of money yes its that much of expensive
Worthless in 2 years....
really though, why would you want this?
The music actually made me cry
That is such a beautiful phone.
Why does anyone care about Steve jobs shirt
What&#39;s the use if it&#39;s going to be obsolete as well after a few years
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDocQ6Qba8g&amp;t=93">1:33</a> did you all see how sloppily joined the back metal sheet is to the actual phone?
This phone is the coolest design I have ever seen! I wish I hade one of those 9 phones.
Yes, absolutely nothing creepy about putting a dead guy’s shirt in your phone.
Test it
hi
Imagine what apple would be if he was still alive now.
Shouldve put his name on the paper n kept it.
a fitting tribute to a capitalist pig.
But why?
At least the iphone 1 is charged
Nise musice
Me: pulls up my $6.7k <br>Friend: wtf is this trash <br>Me: trash? Ur dad can&#39;t even  gets this<br>Also me: <b>pulls up the price tag</b><br>Friend: ...
This feels a little in poor taste..not the video, but that this company used his signature etc
wtfreak
where is the home button !
Desperate times...
Can i ask why Russia have Steve job&#39;s shirts?
Man wore a shirt everyday, so why is this special? Complete waste of money
20 bucks they cut off a Russians fabric shirt and advertised  it as steve jobs shirt lol
As an android fan, I&#39;d love to collect all 9 and pile them together and set them on fire
ijustine must own one of these!! most likely 4/9 one!! i don&#39;t know...if she doesn&#39;t own one of these is not an Apple head(u know like sneaker heads):)))!!
I buy this
Does the Apple Laptop Guy just sit there and say a word or two, and grunt every once in a while?
How does it feel to wear a dead man&#39;s shirt?
iPhone has turned into a religion!
Dude this is fake
&quot;Luxury phone&quot;.. then what is my $1k+ phone :/? Poor?
2019 : Steve Jobs shirt in iPhone <br>2020: steve jobs poop in iPhone
I want one😭😭😭🥺😭😭😭😭
Liked more the previous unboxing therapy approach! Nice the POV one but still..
Really cool but I wouldn&#39;t want a phone that says russia on it 🤮
Next up: Steve Jobs is literally in your phone
8 remaining..
Slap a phone case on there and it becomes a normal iPhone
I mean if you buy it and never use it just put it in some safe and after let&#39;s say 20-30 years potentially you could go and sell it in Pawn start show than Rick Harrison will call some expert over the apple&#39;s products to tell you it doesn&#39;t worth anything hahaa 😅👌🤔 here is some 🍆 thank you for reading
He Would Be Rolling In His Grave... Face Down Ass Up, Cause Thats Terrible...
He predicted 2019
ngl the price was a big disappointment
2nd song?
creepy. I wouldn&#39;t want a dead guys shirt in my phone.
You drop it and the back breaks you🤤
Can’t wait for the drop test on these phones.
Introducing the Iphone 11 Pro Shirt<br><br>We&#39;ve redesigned the phone with diseased people&#39;s fabric.<br>Starts at $6,700
Jerry Rig Everything would definatly scratch test it.
don&#39;t give that to gismo slip
love ur vids  man
It doesn&#39;t matter to me because I am gonna become hokage someday..believe it.
<b>Steve Jobs&#39;</b>
Don&#39; you want to review the $67 790 Gold Airpods pro from caviar
The Beatles is and sas better the. Steve
<b>you can make a drop test of this phone</b> HEHEHE
Imagine dropping it and the screen cracks ._.
It’s funny how people value things.....
I was gonna cry at the end of the video
By the way caviar is russian
but will it blend?
why is it so ugly
They destroyed a Steve Jobs shirt for that
Why would someone use the fabrics from the boxers shorts in a phone, such a silly waste of a memorable artifact.
I got 06/09 😉
What&#39;s the background music very motivated can anyone tell me the name of music
I literally feel so jealous because i really want that phone😭
This seems disrespectful as fuck putting his signature on something he wouldn’t approve of
He may be a genius, but the guy didn’t bathe for days... go ahead, put his shirt in a costly item of luxury - I won’t care
I love hos gullible this guy is
я русский епьта
A piece of his turtleneck is only 29$
Look I don&#39;t care steve jobs shirt is in this phone it just looks SO GOOD OMG
How many times does he say 1/9
WAIT.... SO UR SAYING THERES A DEAD PERSON IN YOUR PHONE. LMFAO
Next is Steve Jobs earwax in your AirPods
Now, durability test.
That camera setup, the thickness is how thick it should be, imo. Why oh why must Apple have their cameras on their phones and tablets protrude. A lot of designers there need to be fired. 😡🤬😵
sorry but i think buying an already unreasonably expensive phone encased in titanium and has a piece of the creator&#39;s turtle neck is.... call me crazy but its  horrendously dumb
How would the android one by like anyway like who is the guy???
i bet the best rick can do is $4
One of the ugliest phones I&#39;ve ever seen..
The most emotional video on Unbox Therapy!
6700 dollars nah
<b>when you bring this to school and people think its fake</b>
Why the zeroes in 01/09
lol, i bet this poor guy stroked his dick after on that iPhone 11 pro with a piece of steve jobs dirty turtle neck... ridiculous
so dumb
That&#39;s actually a better design than the original
It seems gay to me
What does Willy Du even do? Lol I love his one word replies though 🤣
You have a lot of phones in your trash please give one to me😭
Drop test?
Mhm!
Nobody: <br><br>Not a soul: <br><br>Android users: Do they make some for Android
Beautiful
you&#39;re stupid
i just checked Caviar website and it says limited to 99.. but in this video the certificate says limited to 9.. not sure what to believe and how authentic it is. what proof does caviar have to say that its really steve jobs shirt??  priced at $7000 is such a rip off.. that entire website looks dodgy and everything is way over priced.
When will they produce the cloth of Jesus iPhone 11 Pro?
Place of purchase:Russia
yes. iphone is a good religion...
I am willing to spend my entire life savings on this phone
should’ve gave you airpods instead of the wired ones with how much it cost
Sal apple walo uska pan ka tukra ka bati bana ka qpna gaaand ma dalo
You should go to an apple store and try to return it😂
This is really cool but like...<br>Who thought &quot;let&#39;s put Steve jobs&#39; shirt into an iPhone!&quot;
Through out the whole video you don’t even see the front of the phone
Who’s Will and what does he even do
He died in 2018
Imagine someone just tearing that and calling it fake
But... why?
What an absolute fucking piece of overpriced garbage that only a moron would buy
Go subscribe to my YouTube channel I do gaming videos and funny videos my YouTube channel name is <br>excel gang<br>My sure you subscribe 😉
This bullshit vlogger is so annoying
Overrated
what does the phone do?<br>Give me a hand job?
could have gotten better but it got extremely ugly for 7k and russian imei. This definitely doesn&#39;t go to my wish list.
Could it be that Russia robbed Steve Jobs and then killed and that’s why he died XD sorry guys I have went a bit far
this made me too emotional
This apple cult never ceases to amaze me
It’s weird that they ripped a dead man’s clothes
Eh woulda been better if it was his blood
Unbox Therapy will do anything for money.
Maybe be rare but dumb concept. A shirt? Really that&#39;s come baseball card stuff
If you meet someone with this Iphone, you know he is the ultimate appleboy
I misread Steve job shit in this phone.😂😂😂
why is da song in the start the same one as the happy song in i became a dog 2
I hate this.
A man who is excited about a man who died and his used shirt was cut into pieces and sold, amazing this is how far humans have come
that is just stupid af
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ why would you buy it
Ok Steve Jobs Is the best I was at MAC world when he announced iPhone Original
Then you smash it
Steve Jobs: oh shoot I forgot to wash this shirt, let me set it over here<br>Apple fanboys: 👀
THATS ON PLANET EARTH WILL
imagine using a phone case over this phone
Reminding me how stupid things sell.
Take that $6000 and invest it in your future “Apple Inc” next...
Hi
Buy a phone with a piece of a dead person inside it. Before you know it they&#39;re reviewing Soylent Green.
It&#39;s ugly AF
Try to put that in an ecoATM and see how much its worth gonna be. 🤣🤣🤣
Imagine when you walk into steve jobs house you see an Android phone
I swear I can&#39;t be the only one that read &quot;Steve Jobs worn shit in this iphone&quot; bruhhh
This is stupid fuck Steve Jobs 🖕🏽🖕🏽
If only Steve could see this
So what do u do with the phones after  unboxing and
Wait is the original iPhone worth much in really good condition? I have 2 of them in my shoe box of old phones
so... you gotta wash it or nah???
I need to know what he does with these grand phones afterwards.
Its stupidity at peak..
What’s inside just cuts it in half
Up close, the phone is actually ugly and the edges look rough
so he paid like 5k extra for a layer of ROCK and a SMALL PEICE of FABRIC. american..
Imagine it’s like exodus collect all the pieces and Steve pops up
I noticed you never turned it on...  is it an actual working device???  And does the titanium affect performance?
Since I dont know what ti do with my money.  JUST TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
Fuck Steve Jobs
You can&#39;t even charge it wirelessly, what a rip off
The flush back looks way better on the IPhone
BLUE JAYS !!!!! :D
I hate will
Fucking creepy
Can it run fortnite
Do a drop test
Seems apple inc is straying from steve jobs image of easily repairing  expensive devices more as a gimmick
It&#39;s sad how apple uses valued Steve&#39;s stuff for making even more money.
haha the chances of pewds replying to me are 0000000000000.1
what if you droped it.
Hahaha whoever buys this is a fucking joke
Respect Steve Jobs by not clickbaiting us
If the back is titanium doesn’t that mean you give up wireless charging and Apple Pay
Does anyone else notice that the back plate ends at a black section? Anyone notice that it’s an homage to the original iPhone?
U acting hes like a saint and shit
Can somebody gift me an iPhone 11 pro please?
This is a next level of sad and pathetic.
I CAN&#39;T WAIT for What&#39;s Inside to get their hands on this bad boy!!!
I was quit buying apple product because from now on its not worth it. the prize is too expensive they steal money but still no improuvement&#39; sorry apple u don&#39;t fool me anymore&#39;
6700$ wtf.
Gamestop: 4 xbox games and 80 dollars OR 2 ps3 controllers and 100 dollar store credit
This phone costs over $6000
I bet if you can get it out of there it stinks.
Join the cult
i bet they’ll come out with tvs and when steve jobs dies, his organs will be stuffed in them
6700 gor a 64g 💀🤣🤣🤣
lame
So they couldn’t get AirPods with it 😐
Steve Jobs is a masterminded genius 🙏🏼
This isn&#39;t practical. 😒
It’s not really that customized. It’s just a panel glued to the back.
Your phone won’t lay down flat on its backside. But worth it I guess.
What a pos all that for a tiny piece of his shirt lol I thought the back case was going to be made of fabric from his shirt not a single thread under a magnifying glass.
Just went thought that website I found a iphone for 122k no biggie I&#39;ll have 2
hol up now u a bluejay fan ???? if u r i respect u alot 💙
I’m gonna cry
Worth?
Yo i subscribed on so many accounts
10 minutes and he never turned on the phone.. 🤔
I don’t know what I’m feeling rn
Some people have way too much money.
Crazy phone that is unseen before<br><br>Slaps a case on it
Apple used to be awesome but know it’s garbage
Bet this is the iPhone 12

Mind Blowing.
Wth

I ll go for the regular one thank you.
Who else bought one ☝️ like this if u bought one right after this vid
Kinda wish they cut the fabric into the shape of the Apple logo instead of just the tiny square. I assume they wanted to cut as little as the shirt as possible so they can keep doing it for a while. But Design ways. I thought the square in the Apple looked kinda blah xD. Or maybe they could do more with the square like give it a metal frame boarder to make it stand out more. Or maybe people like the simple window into the single swatch. Still cool and memorable.
In the whole video you kept the phone on the table
The price
Get that imei banned. would be fun for 1/9th of the iPhones buyers
So they cut up his old clothes?
You can put a phone Case on the I phone 11 so it can cover the Black part.
Watch it be just a regular piece of black fabric
People have seriously ran out of things to make.. 🤔<br>Let&#39;s be honest here, someone is ready to pay 5 grand more for a piece of shirt (which could be anyone&#39;s as far as I&#39;m concerned) in a phone..
I want you to break the phone and take that phantom out right now

Who else thought that the bottom portion was the shirt part
I wonder how many people are going to see that and be like why does he have a fake iPhone 11

You can actually buy a piece of his turtleneck from minimuseum for 29$
I cloud lock 🔐 <br>Phone lol 😂
This is fucking sad. Why in fucks sake would you want that shit on your phone? fuck me. People have fucking ISSUES.
It would be interesting to hear some ghost stories after this. Like Steve Jobs is haunting the Unbox Therapy studio or something like that.
They can not ever make an iphone thats fully flat
Imagine... just imagine if what’s inside bought this..
I really don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t think I want anyone else&#39;s shirt in my phone. Man, I don&#39;t even want my shirt in my phone.
Finds out he spent a fortune on a shirt from h and m 😂😂😂
Eat some caviar and wine and have a iPhone X cavair
You&#39;d think it&#39;d come with airpods for that price 😂😂
I lowkey almost cried when Steve Jobs Dies
But does it turn on tho
Does anyone know how much this would be worth?
Does anyone know how much this would be worth?
Excelent
Вилсаком переобулся, на английским заговорил...
You should be stupid to spend moneys on this kind of shit.
So, how much does this phone costs again?
I feel poor watching this on my iPhone XR
I just bought one &amp; I’m never gonna use it.
.
9 copies of an 11 pro? Notice something suspicious w/ the numbers? Made by Russians? I don&#39;t like that thought...
Am I the only one that finds it weird to have his shirt inside of it like that?
So is not enough that people are dumb enough to buy apple products, they buy apple products customized with insane pricing for the same bullllshet in first place? if stupidity would hurt too many people would die and i don&#39;t see how world will be worst without them :)
Give it to me ... please <br>I’ll love it forever 😔
You are annoying I&#39;m ngl
i still have the iphone 5😢
$6,700 and no AirPods, thats the only testament to Steve Jobs I see
Take it apart
The people who customized watching the video like dont break it
how does this guy buys so much caviar oh wait he 16 millllllllll
01/09 is literally my birthday
This is nerdgasam to the max
Bruh michael jacksons eyes
How do u put a case on it
i have ipad mini 1st gen and ipod touch 1st gen with physical volume bar
tbh, it loooks like shit
Its a cop boizzzz les gooo
Someone could buy this now and sell it for double the price ten years later
What happens when you crack the screen ? You unlock his turtle neck?
That&#39;s borderline creepy.
Me:takes it to school<br><br>Freinds: eww thats not a iphone 11
Very cool they should send one to a museum so everone can appreciate steve jobs and what he did
<i>Who is gonna see your </i><b><i>Show Off</i></b><i> bro!!?</i> 😜😜
The well tempered clavier. Good touch adding that song. Love it
I wish at least that the battery doesn’t last 1h
Click bate
They’re already working on the fakes
Not gonna lie their is some great people out in this world in past generations but we will never forget how big of an inspiration they were
Does it work and if it does can you try it or something
There’s 0 reasons this should be a thing but I’m not complaining
Yo the sertificut date was on my birthday!:)
The fact he spent the most of the video talking about the back of the phone😒
the thing is<br>11 pro costs R$7000 in Brazil<br>and myself make R$3 hour in a 4-6 hour job<br>so any iphone that i buy is actually luxury lol
I love the look of the backplate, reminds mi the Original and other good old iPhones.
Thats actually creepy af if you think about it
2019: steve jobs shirt on your phone<br><br>2020: Steve Jobs pants on your watch
The headphone jack on the original iPhone not caviar it lookes like a a pen holder
My cousin new Joe Frazier, so did my dad.
This should be named “TOP TEN THINGS THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN YOUR LIFE” or “AND ITEM YOU WILL NEVER BUY”
That’s some Next shit level.
If you buy all 99, can you just patch Steve&#39;s shirt back?!
What about wireless charging? I mean 6700 $.....
Is Caviar sponsoring the show? If so please disclose at the start of the video because this phone is one of the most horribly finished, gaudy pieces of garbage I&#39;ve ever seen featured on a tech channel. If this was a watch, it would be an Invicta. If it was a car, it would be a Mitsubishi Mirage. What trash.
Crazy exclusive.
So you&#39;ve told us that there&#39;s no room for a headjack nah but they fit a whole shirt in there
Does anyone really care though...?
That&#39;s a strange fetish
rear: yes<br>interesting : nope
Tbh, I thought it costed more......
iWonder if Steve Jobs is satisfied about the iPhone 11 itself though.......
Who the fuck cares🤷🏻‍♂️
Who’s watching on iphone
Imagine someone seeing u with this and start mocking you
They could&#39;ve kept the shirt preserved in one piece, but some rich snob of a company had to go and ruin it for profit. This is insulting.
I can’t be the only one who thought they had a whole shirt in there
Idk how stupid is it or not?
So it 1/9 has a small bit of his shirt on the iPhone that shit is stupid asf
I’m drooling 🤤
Sorry I won&#39;t buy this cause I don&#39;t want Steve jobs hunting me every single night for his shirt .
This song was from Steve Jobs movie
i thought 01/09 meant the date lmao
Would Jobs be proud of what his work turned out to become. I swear if another iPhone malfunctions on me  ...<br><br><br><br><br> I&#39;ll make use of apple care 🔥🔥🔥😁🥵🤑🤑🤑
Is it legal for them to rebrand and sell an Apple iPhone?
Lol we are devolving into a bunch of pagans.
GameStop: We will take this for $10.
WTF. That&#39;s just cloth. Steve Jobs is amazing, dont get me wrong. But his clothes??
Imagine having an iPhone with the microphone Steve Jobs used for presenting the first iPhone that’d be sick.
One of nine and your telling my they couldn’t have made the piece of shirt fit the whole Apple logo instead of a tiny ass square. Where the rest of the shirt?
You&#39;re really that popular if a tiny bit of your clothing is worth heaps of money.
Why when I saw the price I said “oh that’s not bad” but I still am no where close to affording it😭
Does anyone give a f if he did wear that shirt ........ god knows how many layers of swer have been dryed on that shirt
Title gave me a headache
Making money off of a dead guy. Classy
Will couldn&#39;t care less😂😂
<b>Man your Warehouse must be worth at least a Million</b>
Start it up
This is sick, but like bad sick..
Remember when we used hot glue guns? That’s what the logo looks like it’s made of
I have 04/09
rips one of Steve Jobs turtleneck and puts it in an iPhone <br><br><br><br><br><br>Apple:yes
Tearing a legend&#39;s wardrobe to pieces for monetization. Great Job!
