I love horror movie
Pennywise was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died
whoever is watching this teaser 4 years from this release is a real one.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=165">2:45</a>
I watch both my uncle and my dad said it was super scary and I am five years old and it’s not scary just kidding I am seven and it’s not scary😅
The dancing grandma is funny af but I still though it was a little scary. But then, at the theater, when she comes as a monster.... Bruh the face is literally a joke wtf, not scary at all
I Love the two movies, Bill Hader is there, i Love so much the two movies but the first movie will always be the best
<i>ooohoohoohoo!</i><br>    <i>ooohoohoohoo!</i><br><br><br><br>                                                  🤡
Does <i>anyone</i> talk about how amazing some actors who are only ever in some short scene like this old lady, are?.... She is FREAKY and it&#39;s because of her mannerisms and expressions and timing etc etc

This is one of the best movie trailers ever made bro still come back to watch this so underrated
No.1 scariest movie ever
This movie was a comedy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=165">2:45</a> it can&#39;t be an It trailer without Pennywise.. Loved that
It: Chapter Two continues brings the Losers Club back to Derry, Maine to reunite and defeat Pennywise for good. It’s pretty frightening at times, emotional with it’s music and scenes, and gives me a good feeling once it’s over.
This is a brilliant trailer as it builds up with adult Beverly revisiting her childhood home and the old lady reciting lines that would imply that Pennywise is back, then into other parts of the movie with the rest of the Losers Club reuniting. IT’S ALL AWESOME!!!
I like that trailer. It was creepy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=118">1:58</a> even that old lady is naked 😳❤

I’m afraid of old people now
When I am watching this I watched it at night and the grandma dancing in the back kinda scared me ngl
Man these McDonald’s commercials are really getting out of hand.

Spectacular It Chapter Two
Very Elegant and Strong Warner Bros Pictures
Wonderfull It Teaser

if you pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=144">2:24</a>, you’ll notice that (for some reason) the main cast is replaced by completely different people in the shot. <br><br>i wonder why they did that.
I love Bill Hader.
Great movie, great actor, great scene
“Name something a burglar would not want to see when he breaks into a house…”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=144">2:24</a> Wow. The Scene with Heorgie gave me Goosebumps.
Bruh, these McDonald&#39;s conmercial are getting out of hand
Wooh....what a movie
no bad cgi 😂
Came here to watch this in 2023
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=133">2:13</a> I hope you were wearing headphones. Brilliant usage of the running sound.

Why is adult Mike so jumpy and nervous in this, he was the calmest of them all.
The nostalgia I’m getting from this trailer
❤❤❤
Everything about this trailer is amazing. The music, the editing, the tension, everything.
Tim Curry did it better!
Please make a it chapter 3
It’s so funny how most of this trailer was one scene 😂
I’m soooooo glad my Nan isn’t like this one 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=154">2:34</a> if memory serves this small clip was never used in the movie, and I wonder why? I’m in the middle of reading the book so maybe I’ll come across something like it, but I feel like if I do I’ll end up wishing that they kept it in the movie
no
I AM A GOD! I DON&#39;T BELONG HERE!
I am in the middle of reading the book of this. I have had many dreams about it, but it is a very good story.
Still watching this trailer in 2023! It&#39;s that good. No pun intended.
The old lady is more terrifying than Pennywise.
Got this on dvd...love it...the guy who plays the clown...he is really good...the rest of the cast...also...first class acting👍❤
IT Chapter One: 🤤<br><br>IT Chapter Two: 😑
I&#39;m surprised Bill never won a oscar from his performance.
I rewatched it, and it&#39;s better than I first realized
Let’s just kill Vecna now when Stranger Things 5 comes in 2024

Such a shame this movie wasn’t as good as the trailer made it out to be
One of the greatest trailers you’ll ever see.
I think since Andy muschietti did so good with it 2017 and it chapter 2 2019 I think he should totally make an AAAHH real monsters live action movie and make more sequels to it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=136">2:16</a> ahhhhhhhhhh yeah
Just watched it and as I felt…they always mess up the sequels. I know many people loved it but for me it was a miss. I REALLY LOVED the first movie - the plot, creep, child actors and specially the romance b/w Bill and Bev. This movie was not that good. I felt the casting was not good and overall story was just okay… like the way they defeated it - that I felt was kinda miss
2;18 to the end is give me …. Weird feeling
Always that same evil grandma actress
Chapter 3 plz😢😢

I remember the day when this trailer dropped. I was watching the countdown for the video, waiting for it to come. And when it finally did,my WiFi was acting up. For like 10 minutes.🙄

(esto parece SPAM, pero es necesario dejar claro esto a quien le llegue) si la pedofilia es la perdida del instinto partenal en hombres hacia mujeres menores de edad e incluso niñas, y en mujeres es la perdida del instinto materno cuando su atraccion esta fijada en niños pequeños, es ilegal, inmoral, incorrecto, y aunque duele que sea valido en casos extremos de malestar (porque no hay otra opcion visible), es mejor no alimentar eso. Desde esta misma analogia, la persona que fue zoofilico, es practicamente la perdida de la aptitud y capacidad reproductoria de ese humano o humana, y ambas cosas estan mal, Mejoren sus conductas, aprendan de la ciencia, el daño es irreversible, pero puede reconstruirse solo si aprende a gestionarse bien como persona, sera funcional, esto va tanto para personas que han sido victimas como para victimarios (los cuales deberian ser creativos y buscar una solucion ingeniosa que no implique lastimar a otr@)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=154">2:34</a> when he jumps out the vents I can’t remember this scene what happened there?
It&#39;s not that much of a &quot;teaser trailer&quot; it&#39;s not scary at all. What a rip off of a movie! But it made money right?
Iiiiiiiiaaaaaaa
Turned this one on after the new Pennywise show announcement!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=154">2:34</a> that is definitely a scene that was cut because it’s not in the movie and it’s not on the blu ray which is annoying. For people who have read the book i think it’s the scene where Mike faces off against Pennywise when he takes the shape of a giant bird and Mike is able to yell at it until it goes away. I wish it was in the movie cause Mike did barely anything in these movies while he was one of the best characters in the book
It&#39;s a pity the movie didnt have the trailer quality :(
Love this flim it peenywise

The sound of the clown laugthing is not great.
Davvero questo è così spaventoso😭😭😭⚰️💔
I love it🤗🤗🤗🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈good film🎈🤗
i can&#39;t forget his laugh
I saw the first in the cinema and didn&#39;t think it was scary, thought the second may be better, waited til I got it with prime, but not scary at all , bit cartoonish,  well made, though  some of the special effects/make up are a bit iffy, kinda like from night of the living dead but still with the same special effects/make up tech from back then 😬. But not scary at all.
😧😧😧😧😧😧😧🤏😧😧😧
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=165">2:45</a> why does this sound like Voodoo Dolly by Siouxsie and the Banshees?

Dear Warner bros I would like so say you that it chapter could become more awesome if you use old cast in it
only climax is good in this movie

Disappointment
Trailer 👍<br>Movie 👎
Best followup film ever absolutely amazing you just a clown whaha  said to my self now I gota go get guns and kill penny-wise when he said to little girl cone closer and I&#39;ll blow it away then bites head off granny with 3 mouths very scary trailer starts at 1 hour 41 granny opens door this is amazing 🤡🤡🤡🤡🙃
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=137">2:17</a> this music  gives me chills
I would rather marry pennywise (which yes he is my idol) than be in Beverlys place watching that grandma I&#39;d throw up
Remember when we all thought this was going to be a good movie?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=72">1:12</a> i find its quite funny after i saw it again 😂
Why does the clown at the end sound like Winnie the Pooh, its slightly disconcerting
2 years later I&#39;m still here
Georgie:-Who are you?<br>Pennywise:-I am Pennywise,the dancing Clown.<br>Then,<br>A voice comes from behind,<br><br>And,WE ARE VENOM.
This trailer played when me, my dad, and my sister saw Godzilla King of the Monsters. I find it ironic this trailer played during the previews for that movie because one of the forms Pennywise takes in the book is Rodan, a monster in the Gozilla franchise (which was also in the King of the Monsters movie).<br><br>Also, Pennywise is the reason why my sister is afraid clowns, so she had to cover her eyes when this trailer played.
I don&#39;t like the fact that beverly is ended up with ben!wtf!...bev&amp;bill should&#39;ve ended up together 😭😭😭

Another case where the trailer was better than the movie itself, how disappointing.
Why would they show the grandma&#39;s full body without her braw. This movie should be 25+
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=34">0:34</a> <b>the grandma in the background looks like me when I’m trying to box but I’m failing</b>
If an old lady I just met says “my father joined the circus” I’m gettin tf outta there
The bet trailer i&#39;ve ever seen
I remember watching IT Chapter Two in theaters and this scene legit creeped everyone out, lol. The entire movie was great in my opinion! ♥️
اول عربيه🌚✌🏻
The whole time I was screaming <b>&quot;WHAT WAS THAT!? WHAT WAS THAT!? WHAT. WAS. THAT!?&quot;</b>
Well i&#39;m scared of old people and the sewers now
You would think spent all those 27 years getting ready to kill that clown but I guess not.
This movie was actually good , there&#39;s even a short scene with STEPHEN KING in IT .
I remember seeing this I remember the hype and everything is now gone the only thing to be excited for is the it supercut

Bill Hader was unaware that Bill Skarsgård can actually move his eyes in two different directions. Hader asked Skarsgård what kind of editing was done to achieve the effect in the first movie. Skarsgård, in full costume and makeup, responded by saying &quot;Oh, you mean this?&quot; and doing it, causing Hader to freak out.

At least we can all agree the acting in this film was brilliant
Hard to believe the sequel sucked this bad after the first one.

For me they dragged chapter 2 out. Some parts I could of lived without and they overdid it and made it too long. I literally fell asleep in the theater. Chapter 1 when they were kids was way better than them being adults but that’s just me.

me watching the trailer in 2020:*still gets excited*
well this movie was a huge letdown.<br>&quot;Well at least we didn&#39;t end it like the b-&#39;&#39; the book ending was an improvement over this
This trailer alone was better than the entire movie.

Honestly, I have had a severe fear of clowns since I was a kid. Saw Chapter 1 in the theaters and I loved it. But obviously it was pretty intense for me lol is chapter 2 scarier than the first one? Im watching it tonight, ive been putting it off a couple weeks lol
The cookies in the oven...kinda reminds me of Hansel &amp; Gretel story.
Why were both remakes total crap?

These movies and the cast mean so much to me

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=71">1:11</a> I thought my screen was posseded
Only if the movie could have been as good as the trailer . Movie is complete shit compared to the first part .
I WATCHED IT MORE THAN 4 TIMES
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=137">2:17</a>
Me anytime someone says or even thinks the word &quot;IT&quot;:
Make a movie about how he become clown....
Yes but see Billy &amp; Georgie that make me so sad I hate pennywise he killed a little innocent kid
shiver me timbers
it makes me sad that people only see this as a horror movie, i see it as my reason to live
We can all agree pennywise is basically gordon ramasy who specializes on human flesh. He even runs his own fast food chain.
Dude when I saw this trailer in IMAX and the woman started running and you can hear it on either side that shit sent chills down my spine
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=108">1:48</a> that sounds liek bendy and the ink machine kind of music
PLOST TWSIT: PENNYWISE DIDNT DIE
One of the my favorite muvie
I kinda felt boring watching at some point in the film..it just felt too slow..and also isnt bev really a slut?  A married women, kisses his childhood love, and then kiss another guy to whom during childhood she rejected prolly coz he was too fat but now is a multi millionaire handsome..
Never been to McD since this movie
Who also wants the third chapter of IT?
Y granma walking round naked
Those foot steps man. Wearing headphones and watching this was a bad idea...

Интересно, страшно, но почему-то смешно.
Ok, so I am wondering...<br><br>After all of these years of penny wise&#39;s disappearance, he was buying more balloons?
Bro I want to see it again
Why isn&#39;t in Netflix this filmmmmm😭
It is not the &#39;IT&#39;.. The sequelnis &#39;shIT&#39;

nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooop
I still think the movie was good, but it sure as hell didn’t live up to this trailer.
That lady when she ran that sound make me to throw my phone before the scene change. And when she gazed at Bev for some time I was wondering some scary is going to happen but after sometime the sounds of running made be 🧟🧟
The fact that i saw mrs kersh stare at bethany when she was looking at the pictures creeped me out
What the nice movie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=165">2:45</a> god! That sound. That theme is what I&#39;m looking for since past 4 hours.
Too horrible movie I didn&#39;t sleep😴😴 after watching this movie at night🌃🌃
The normal grandma already more scary than Pennywise
The new joker movie looks great so far!!!
This is the reason why no one likes to visit their grandma&#39;s
Just watched it...like I am blown away even looking for movies just like it. Part one was levels and part two is on a whole other level...I love the fact that it also deals with how one can be a loser and still make it...losers are cool...
Plus la qualité de la vidéo.
matt stonie

God Jessica Chastain as Beverly was a great freaking choice. She is still beautiful and a badass.
Honestly I Liked 2nd Chapter.. I know some scenes were disturbing.. But the concept was really good.. Felt Bad for Eddie and Stan.. It was scary plus full with emotions
No one who dies here ever really dies<br>Me:bish run bish run BISH RUN

I actually loved It Chapter 2, it was really good, funny and scary with a strong story. Not as good as the first but still amazing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=167">2:47</a>.   HELLO THERE
THATS PENNYWISE HE WANTS TO PLAY JUST SAY NO AND THATS MY COSTUME
This movie was more funny then scary
It 2 feels more scary than it 1
This movie was shit lol
I can’t believe this was a year ago
People that watch this movie will be like the old  grandma is penny wise one of the best movie
It&#39;s been 1 years old already wow time flies so fast
&quot;NEKKID GRAMMA&quot;
INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO BEAT A IT:<br>if you find a It under your bed, in your closet, in your cabinet stuck between the pots it can be a pain in the neck. Here how to get rid of it.<br>1)Find where it hides(it usually leaves huge amounts of filth)<br>2)Stay still and do not scream(it is used to enjoy people that run in circles shrieking like bitches)<br>3)Make a joke on It(despite the appearance It is more sensitive)<br>4)The key is to make him unhappy, if the third point doesn&#39;t work you can make a joke on his mom.
Moral of the story: don&#39;t fuck with gram gram.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=176">2:56</a> minute video: most of it being Beverly and a old lady
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=162">2:42</a>
I&#39;m gonna watch this in a few minutes after I shower. I cant wait part 1 was pretty good I&#39;m excited. I know I&#39;m behind but that&#39;s ok. I got a lot of catching up to do on my firestick😁😁
If pennywise would actually win and kill all the kids. Then it would have been a horror movie like other scary movies you saw as a kid. When only 1 made it out, but not in every case like the movie Descent. Damn movies were good back then.
me cago hablen no hablen ingles
it was uploaded may 10 2019<br>and now is may 10 2020<br><br>yesterday is 11 months
ONE YEAR AGO THIS WAS POSTED AAAA😭
ONE FUCKING YEAR AGO TODAY THIS TRAILER DROPPED WHAT THE FUCKKCKCKCO
HELL NO.
These McDonald’s commercials are getting out of hand.
How about another joke pennywise? What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandon him and treats him like trash? I&#39;ll tell you what you get. You get what you fucking deserves.🔫 Pennywise: joker, you&#39;ll float too.
Scary
I’m about to watch this for the 1st time <br>I procrastinated for the longest time<br>Watched the whole fast and furious saga including Hobbs and Shaw<br>Watched joker<br>Us<br>Jexi <br>The intruder<br>Jaws<br>Ect.<br>Wish me luck😓
super cool &amp; scary as heck bruv
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=154">2:34</a> i want to know what scene this is from cause i watch it a couple weeks ago and i didn&#39;t see that scene in any part of the movie? 🤔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=167">2:47</a> Hello.. This wasn&#39;t scary, it was cute!!
Worse movie I have ever seen<br>too predictable and too long
The teaser trailer scene was better than the actual movie.
What’s grossers than gross mama grandma
she&#39;s the gramma from the visit isn&#39;t she? damn she has a thing for psycho demon shit

My favorite part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=142">2:22</a>
If you guys didn’t know, the “tea” that Pennywise gave Beverly was actually sewage
My mind : iTs a GiRl
It chapter three: Bill skarsgard in the movie but he can transform into pennywise like vampires
This sequel was more like <i>Evil Dead 4</i> than <i>It 2</i>
Anyone else notice Eddies face bandage switch sides of his face when they descend into the sewer beneath the house??!!??!!
when this film released guys?
I like Billy and Georgie😍😍😘
I love how they made this scene as trailer
Fak nic moc fak bic

Okay but HEAR ME OUT<br>I cannot be the only one who has a crush on Bill, HAVE YOU READ THE BOOK? he is fucking suicidal after Georgies death and he doesn&#39;t even know it, I just want to give him a hug. And I&#39;m not talking about having a crush on the actor who plays Bill, I&#39;m talking about the character, I fell in love with his personality he is such a strong and free person.<br>If you haven&#39;t read the book you don&#39;t know what i&#39;m talking but if you did please coment<br>Okyy bye
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=151">2:31</a> He finally floats after all.

It 3 what ?????
Here to relive the excitement and contentment I felt while waiting till two in the morning for this to premiere. The countdown, my eyes bulging out my head from being so invested in it, finally seeing and hearing the content I&#39;ve wanted for two years, thinking the music was the most awesome thing to reach my ears, rewatching it at least ten times and then finally going to bed, coming up with ideas and theories as to what is what, the visuals and audio were so astounding to me and I felt so intense but in a good way. When it came out in theaters, I waited a week so I could enjoy it without a crowd and went on a school day (I graduated last year), a couple people said they wanted to come with me but I said no because I didn&#39;t want to associate my new favorite movie with another person and I also wanted to just enjoy and soak up the experience. I loved the movie (still do) and although it was a bit disappointing in some regards, I&#39;m still hoping for a directors cut or a prequel.<br><br>For a long time THIS was what I was looking forward to.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=122">2:02</a> this scared the heck out of me
After watching IT CHAPTER 2, I always kept thinking for an idea for IT CHAPTER 3 { Which I think will never come out }... I obviously love this movie since 2017. Been waiting and- I cry myself to sleep every night thinking why IT has to end..anyways, idea :<br><br><br>1. Pennywise comes back.. <br>     [ Head : Okay so, they will be old but uh- why not make them like..after 2 or maybe 3 years.. ]<br><br>2. Maybe Eddie comes back cause  of Richie being traumatised Eddie dies [ Just like me, my favourite boy died. I had a mental breakdown about him dude. ]<br><br>3. Georgie uh- returns.. [ I have seen The Prodigy and Georgie acts in that movie as Miles. And I found him way handsome than I thought. I am 11 years old and- I probably just should like him as a character. He is my everything. :P ]<br><br>It is fine if you cant do this, I understand.
That grandma reminds me of my grandma<br>She always be naked chasing me
Is this worth watching?
that grandma tho...
Naked Granny
Who else came back to this trailer
Right when she said “joined the circus” at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=111">1:51</a> bev should’ve knew 😂
Richie Hiding: Hey losers, time to float! 😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=173">2:53</a>
omg
From September <br><br>Ah shit, here we go again
What a shitty fuckin movie... dog turd on the curb could be interpreted as a better story... absolite rat cunt of a movie....
RIP Steven king
Please upload this.full movie on you tube
I  cant tell if it is scarier or if that naked granny who forgot her towel is
The trailers were better than the movie.
PLS MAKE CHAPTER 3 I THINK WE KNOW IT DID NOT END
Grown Beverly role should have been done by Scarlett Johannson<br>Earlier role was well played
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=161">2:41</a> Minnie mae!
Bored to death. I don&#39;t like everyone pointlessly swearing constantly. It doesn&#39;t add anything. Nobody can act, except Mike Hanlon...I hated the CGI in the fortune cookies. The 1990 one was way better by a million times. <br><br>Everyone looks Hollywood. Too clean and attractive at all times (unlike real people). <br><br>Relying on jump scares is a lame move,  also. <br><br>I&#39;ll give you Mrs. Hirsch, tho...needed more ancient body parts flying around for the full effect, tho...and less light. <br><br>Beverly as adult going to her old house. Old lady announces her father&#39;s death. Beverly (no change at all), &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, you didn&#39;t know...&quot; <br><br>Once found a dead centipede in a bag of sugar. That was way creepier than this whole movie. <br><br>I didn&#39;t like the the way they used the words &quot;crackheads&quot; in the paper. They NEVER use that word.<br><br>This movie was supposed to take place in the 1980&#39;s, with the kids in the 1950&#39;s or so. Not crazy about the idea that the only black family in town is OF COURSE a bunch of crackheads. Why not just use the N word as originally intended? I don&#39;t think they even HAD crackheads in the 1980&#39;s.<br><br>They have to have used the F word 100 pointless times. And blaspheme &quot;God dammit&quot; at least another half dozen. Pointless to the story; added nothing. <br><br>Of course, it was obvious Hollywood condoned child molesting when they used Gary Glitter&#39;s &quot;Rock and Roll pt 2.&quot; <br><br>That POS is a SEVERAL TIMES CONVICED child molester! And they GIVE HIM money???<br><br>Myra Kasparov is that &quot;pretty&quot; Hollywood fat. Not like a real person. <br><br>The Eddie hypochondriac with the fake inhaler the pharmacist told him about is very relevant to the story. They leave it out. Henry Bowers is killed very early on, leaving out the conflict of a real threat.<br><br>I didn&#39;t see the point of Mike with the Indians. Added nothing. And all the silly babbling that had nothing to do with the book. Along with the burning of artifacts--also not in the book.
WAOOOOOOO

Sorry ,but it chapter 2 sucks , I prefer the chapter one ,they were kids  and they had dreams , they wanted so badly to end this things and they did ,but the old ones they were so boring I just did not like it , and what about ritchie being gay ,I mean the whole time were talking about getting layed and stuff of straight people and then in second chapter turn out to be like that , and what about all of them forgetting what happen and they did not met since that time
I&#39;m so scraret

Malarda está peli
Any Oscar for this movie?!
What a bust!! Smh 🤦‍♂️
BRUH. WHEN THE NAKED GRANDMA WAS RUNNING TOWARDS HER I ALMOST PEED MY PANTS-
The movie is not skary at all
I am terrified of clowns
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=74">1:14</a> very scary
This movie was fucking amazing I don’t see how people didn’t enjoy this it was never a dull moment and was shot beautifully ...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=43">0:43</a> I don’t know if anyone else saw this besides me but there are six bugs forming an almost circle-like shape on the window. Six members of the Losers Club come back and they perform the Ritual of Chüd. The seventh bug isn’t on the window because Stan “took himself off the board” or in this case I’d call it a “window.” I was just thinking about it and I thought I should share it.
that freakin&#39; old lady made me Laugh My Fuckin&#39; Ass Out
I have a movie
6,5/10 imdb....
I can&#39;t even describe how much I loved the movie it totally blew me away.  Total masterpiece 🔥💖👍
How can be scard  of penywise if you know who is under all that make up
Nick where are you my love 💖💯😭
chapter 2 was a funny comedy =) specially the dog scene lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=118">1:58</a> why is that grandma dancing like a fortnite character on steroids?
it isn&#39;t the clown that scared me, it was the old lady running around naked that scared me.
I didn&#39;t like this one. The first one felt like a comedy with a killer clown that somehow fits in the movie, the second one felt like a budget rushed hollywood movie
He can teleport and make you see anything he wants, yet he can&#39;t stop 6 humans.... Horror movies at its finest, he could have easily trapped them all in an illusion and bitten their heads off
So, the naked old grandma is the Scare material this time<br>* S A V E M E I &#39; M S C A R E * @@
Im very happy that the homosexual persons at the begining ot the movie died
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=122">2:02</a> the grandma was dancing
Holy crap the sound of her footsteps will give me goosebumps
I was shocked at the end the old lady was pennywise daughter
this fun i love IT
Benny’s grandma
Scare me
IT : I am a scary clown that will scare the bollox of you....<br>Naked Grandma:.... Hold my beer.
“Name something you would not want to see when coming into a house”<br><br>“Naked grandma!”
I watched this movie in theaters twice I wanna do it again it was so fun and it was funny
may 2019 me wasn’t prepared for what they did to reddie
I thought this movie was scary and tragedy but after watching i realized it&#39;s a comedy.
I would have liked the creature to appear in its true form in the last scene of the movie, because in reality I did not like its shape with the spider&#39;s body and the face of its clown face, and I also felt that the director of the movie tried to end the movie quickly In the last scene
The naked grandma was to mention Stanley he died in the bath tub
It&#39;s a funny movie!
I&#39;m just gonna say something, <br>On Sept. 6, This movie was released,<br>On Sept.6, The movie K-12 was ALSO released.<br>The Trailer Song for K-12 matches the Trailer here.

This movie disappointed me the most <br>Not even a single moment scared me 😶
Grudge Red Band brought me back here. Anyone else?
Ay one
These McDonalds commercials are getting intense
&quot;No one who dies here ever really dies&quot; says the entity that murdered thousands of children
This movie was so boring .. the first one was way better.
I usually don&#39;t like remakes, but this was a damned good one!
Ive been waiting for 10 years to watch this clown pennywise 2
I hate it when they do remakes of a &quot;good&quot; movie!  This remake is stupid, not scary, and Pennywise looks like a funny clown!  Omg, the original IT was so much better!!
Rosés are red, a violet is blue if you come with me you float too
they became stupider tbh

The scariest thing about this movie was the run time...and the Pomeranian *shudders
Does anybody knows the soundtrack of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=108">1:48</a>
My fiancee husband movie this fav
I remember being in class when this was uploaded and being scared, excited, and creeped out
I have this movie
The movie was gayyyyy
Please like me
Pennywise is not scary at all, it&#39;s just a big-headed clown who walks funny. The old lady is doing a better job at scaring people. I hope there will not be a chapter 3, or else it&#39;s going into a shithole.
Havent seen the movie e
You guys should make a chapter 3 of it
That smile 😰😰😰😨
Just saying that IT 2 was released on September 6, 2019<br>9(the month of September) +6(the day in September it was released on)+ 2+0+1+9(the year),<br>=27 years (the time when IT returns to Derry)<br><b>mother of god</b>
I came after watching this movie last night .
I’m sorry but every time  that old lady says “my fader joined the circus”  I start laughing so hard cause she says fader instead of father 😂

why is grandma naked
THIS MOVIE SUCKS
Si la voy a ver
Not bad.  And - Spoiler Alert (Minor) - the writer character catching grief for the bad ending of his book was very appreciated self aim humor from King.  That was awesome and unexpected.  And funny because some people thought the ending of the IT book was weak.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=166">2:46</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=165">2:45</a>

Movie idea: Freddy Krueger Vs Pennywise
These McDonald&#39;s commercials are really getting out of hand.
What brand cigarette she smoke. Any one tell
the friendly “Helloooo!” At the end got me so happy lol
Good job
Seeing the grandma in her underwear is scarier than it
Hello <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=169">2:49</a>
Omg scared as hell
Part 1..&amp; 2 bst horror mv..
I like the old one as a kid
Does anybody have a link to a version to watch without those stupid, intrusive, highly unnecessary Korean hardcoded subtitles?
Naked Grandma- Scare 100
ohw
so that&#39;s why we don&#39;t see Ronald McDonald in the McDonalds commercial
The film has very sad ending
Hey why is everyone comments, líke two years ago, is there any body from 2021
Hello Vicky.....
They showed almost the entire scene here. This was probably the most effective horror scene in the movie too, in the sense that you felt some tension and unease.
Pick a grave but not the least one it&#39;s taking bobi bobi bobi Billy lol
I love the original one
Where can I watch it online
When pennywise kills someone<br>Pennywise: look att me! What did you expect?
Legit the worst movie ever made
Wow amazing. Nice director look like real
The best movie I could ever see.... Awesome...
seriously though the grandma is scarier than pennywise
It chapter two lives up to It one in every way
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=44">0:44</a> anybody gonna talk about the fact that they&#39;re in Maine
Pennywise is McDonald&#39;s ice cream machine cause it gets fixed every 27 years.
1999 : Granny&#39;s cook pies<br><br>2017 : Granny&#39;s cook cookies <br><br>2019 : Naked Granny&#39;s
That grandma only wants her clothes.

Why does Pennywise sound like winnie the pooh when he says &#39;&#39;hello&#39;&#39;
This is the best horror movie trailer
Secretly the grandma is dramatic
This movie was horrible I regret wasting my time watching it. When a naked grandma running is scarier than any of the monsters you know it&#39;s bad...
Fuck you all asshole
You guys should see what she looks like. She was so tall and was straight up naked. I will be tripping if she came at me
This movie was so dam good
oh g
Aah shIT, here we go again..
When he says hello he sounds like Winny the pooh😄😄

Totally unpredictable ending of &quot;it chapter 2&quot;

I hate horrors and I&#39;m going to my friend for Halloween and we are going to watch it... What should I do????
Wait a second<br>Pennywise have a kid???<br><br><br><br><br><br>Next At It Chapter 3<br>Shows Pennywise&#39;s wife...

(Goes small)
I was a little upset they grew up :&lt; I liked the movie as kids against a clown making them adults kinda ruins it for me.
Introducing:pennywise the dancing CLOWN!!
YES I am commenting so I don&#39;t have to watch this on full screen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=164">2:44</a> was when i was like: oooh this might be worth watching
B
REEEE I CANT WAIT FOR THE FILM TO COME OUT OF SKY CINEMA AND SKY STORE REEEEEEEEEEE
Why in the starting of the movie starts with two gay couple dies you know I&#39;m gay and I just feel so bad for his lost
You eat kids, Pennywise! Not adults!
Well, the movie wouldn’t show up for me anymore on Cineplex anymore now that October 22nd is when the movie ended. Now I cannot see the movie in theatres which is a shame and sucks majorly. Fucking hell with movie dates though. Now I have to avoid even more spoilers for the movie and need to get the Blu Ray version which won’t have that same feeling of being in the movies ffs. <br>Edit: Never the fuck mind. Thanks Knightwing for spoiling the movie’s ending you fucking asshole.
This is scary AF !!!!
memories
I&#39;m terrified but I wanna know what happens in the so please could someone let me know what happens?
The movie wasn’t that bad I just expected more real-like stuff instead of CGIs... there’s a bunch of those.

Hi
These McDonald&#39;s commercials are getting out of hand
I watched this film eariler today and I personally think it try&#39;s extremely hard to promote suicide it talks about it, shows it and even uses the number 27 which is a very high age for suicide and I&#39;m personally sick of it, why do sooo many film&#39;s, tv shows all promote suicide??? There&#39;s a Whole show called &quot;10 reasons why&quot; or something, aswel i think it&#39;s a Joke they can promote it So openly like its fine because it&#39;s not!!!😡😡🤬🤬
i would play a videogame version,like from IT&#39;s perspective :X
Just watched it chap 2 <br>Hate to say<br>Full of shit
They should call it awwww shit here we go again

The old lady is just the slightest bit creepy
I can’t believe the voice at the beginning is Bill Skarsgård it’s so weird listening after my friend told me
Who&#39;s Beverly&#39;s actress , billy  , richie and stans?<br>(like both of them)
The deleted scenes are still here lmao
Going to see this today...finally!
The most disappointing movie of 2019
Amazing !! Lovely
That “Hello” sounded like Winnie-the-Pooh
It was so good I watched it at 11:15am by 6 last night I went to go buy the book from Barnes and Noble just to read this classic pop culture novel again
Ok? is pennywise Mary Poppins?
want to watch the whole thing
G is not faster than me
i don&#39;t care what anyone says this movie was GOOD
He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts
I cant wait die chapter 3
It Chapter 3 Coming?
Hhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaa
Oh shit
Every single grandma is like this! Strange.. oh strange!
I just saw something and im scared HALP
Gammy can die. I dont like her
How does Pennywise do that smile?
Spoiler warning but<br><br><br><br><br>Your telling me IT can do all this make life forms and TURN INTO HIS FUCKING FINAL FORM, LITERALLY HAS THE POWERS OF DEATHLIGHTS but when a couple of loser call him a clown he fucking dies

[Spoiler]<br><br><br><br><br><br>It&#39;s interesting to see the director add a sub-plot of beings accepted as gay in this society. I actually smirked when the gay couple kissed, but for a completely different reason. A family decided to bring along a 7-9yr old along. First thing I hear behind me is &quot;eew&quot;. I get it, he&#39;s (somewhat) innocent about these types of things. Yet, I hope the parents acted mature after the movie and explained this scene to him.<br><br>As a side note I haven&#39;t read the book so I don&#39;t know if it was mentioned or not, but I was intrigued by the subtle message that Richie was gay. I also noticed (by the end) that the first death (the gay couple) was foreshadow and an exact reflection of how Eddie died and Richie feeling the most pain from his secret love towards him.

IT Chapter 2 was a fantastic movie and wasn&#39;t as great as the first IT Chapter 1, but it was still a badass  film. It chapter one and chapter two were one of the best horror films of all time. Who cares about what &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; has to say about IT Chapter: 2. I&#39;m almost 36 years old and both movies gave me nightmares.
I just watched the movie a while ago. The almost 3-hr long is worth to watch. The jumpscares were on point especially the Grandma scene. Hahahaha! I love how they included comedy. Hahahaha! But terrifyingly good.
The Warner Bros logo for IT that has everyone asking: Wait, is this in 3D?
Boy it feels good to have finally watched the Chapter 1 and now watching the trailer makes fucking sense HAHAH
The price was more scarier than the movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUopiAYdRg&amp;t=117">1:57</a> thanks mr later
Film was rubbish, soooo boring and Not good like previous IT movies.<br><br>So Dissapointing, nearly fell sleep 😴
