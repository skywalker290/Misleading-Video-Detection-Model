Tim Burton bringing Michael Keaton in this movie is so cool! He would have been proud seeing his Batman return one last time.
Peter bollen van tienen!!!!!

Baby Dumbo would &#39;ve looked cute in a disposable baby diaper. I love him. He is adorable. So precious. So cute. So sweet.

This movie was unsettling as an adult, I can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;d be like as a kid. Some cartoons don&#39;t need to be made to look real.
I haven’t been watching it, because in general it’s a sad story and I am afraid I will be crying. Yes yes I know it’s fake blabla. Still. Also the Disney drawing movie is really sad story. I just don’t understand how you can make it so sad…
Both versions of Dumbo should be withdrawn from circulation because the main character is an elephant the symbol of the GOP.
I love this movie !! I&#39;m sorry to being late for this movie but....  This is so touching me 😢😢😢😢 After watching this movie, I want to pay more for the Animal charity donation 😇 / I think the live-action Dumbo is so cute like the REAL young elephant be!!! Thank you for all team work of this movie!!!!  Thank you so much.
Dumbo&#39;s magic 💫 I can fly with my ears! I need no flights ! 💤
This is by far the best Disney Remake of them all, It’s amazing and SO Beautiful ❤
There were 2 penguins Danny and Colin and a Batman Michael

I like animation movies
I just watched it on Disney plus. Dumbo got a small part in this movie. The movie is more about  Collin F + the 2 kids. And the movie kinda sucks. Disney failed with this movie.
Very touching  movie ❤ super cute dumbo ❤
Dumbo Happy help
An Elephant Can Fly?
Y is he called dumbo😢😂
Left me out kmt

I have a question and a thought, in the disney cartoon dumbo was delivered by the storks and in the real life version of the new movie dumbo was born and there&#39;s one thing that I thought who&#39;s dumbo father or did he have one????
O filme do dumbo é lindo !!! Fala do amor de mãe pra filho e vice versa ...que esta passando na globo hoje .
Is Timothy the mouse not in this remake? He was such a crucial character in the original, being Dumbos only friend
i&#39;m here for danny
I&#39;ve never seen something both more hideous and terrifying at the same time.
Dumbo is what how the pesky vegans and ARA cultists depict dairy and meat induatry was like.
Is it aurora&#39;s voice?
Wow
Nice remake
this is great the trailer
auroras cover of baby mine OMG
The only Disney remake that truly hit their mark!!
Not a fan of this movie... but, this trailer is so beautiful!
Dumbo and his mom 😭
Dumbo music
who&#39;s version of  Baby Mine is this??? it&#39;s so good, but the arcade fire version is not it. I can&#39;t find this version, please someone tell me

Película de Dumbo, dónde Dumbo no es el protagonista jajaj
Fun fact: That little girl in the remake is the same actors who will later play Sarah Miller in HBO&#39;s The Last of Us. Damn, she&#39;s come a long way from this.
I liked this live action actually
Me and mom went and saw this movie the night it came out and it was one of the best new Disney movies <br>I really enjoyed and it reminded me of when I was in Disney world to visit my sister around December 2018 <br>On the night when I arrived there was when I first saw the trailer of this in the all star movies gift shop and <br>It really captured my interest in the magic of Disney and everything so thank you so much for inspiring me <br>With this amazing new remake film of Disney’s Dumbo
I wonder how many migs he picks up with  those ears?
Look at those ears!

Well this remake was down right adorable.🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍<br>I still love the original. But sometimes they actually put some heart into the remake&#39;s.<br>Very few remakes ever make it into my list of favorites.
My mom ....love you forever in a lifetime...
It owuld have been if DISNEY made a film about the ELEPHANT THAT THOMAS EDISON ELECTROCUTED. THEN i COULD GET ON BOARD AND UNDERSTAND ANIMALS IN ZOOS, ANIMALS LIVES WASTED FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF MAN WAS ABOUT. INSTEAD,  DISNEY RE-WROTE A LONG LOVED CHILDS STORY INTO A WEAK ATTEMPT AT ANIMAL RIGHTS. ANOTHER DISNEY FLOP!! CHOOSE A REAL STORY AND TELL THE TALE CORRECTLY. DISNEY!
Wait there was a dumbo live action? And it was 3 years ago???
This is why I have the profile dumbo I will always love dumbo since if I’m an adult🥰
I love dumbo 🥰😍🥰 And mrs jumbo🥰🥰😍
I love dumbo 😍🥰🥰😘 And Mrs jumbo 😍
this isn&#39;t a bad movie
I&#39;ll wait for Dumbo 8. A such lack of creativity and imagination from Disney... Disgusting
Listen the animated version is more meaning stop also destroying movies cause of begin lazy and rushing quality I grew up when things where simple and this is a terrible remake for the kids leave certain movies alone also it’s a as a bad move to Buy Marvel studios and den change the movies around after Stan Lee dies you gonna lose major sales lying to the consumer
I love the scene where Colette holds the boy on her lap as he sleeps.

bless tim burton but I’ll never forgive disney for ruining their live action remakes with unmemorable human characters, auto-tune on ones we needed realism in the voice for, no seamless musical/acting transitions, cutting essential already crowd-tested&amp;approved songs out of the classic remakes, adding completely new songs that nobody asked for. With the current content we just wanted Be Prepared in Lion King and to see Nala actually sing spirit as beyonce.
Dies fake

This is a different 1941 version.
Looong time throw back
I have to say this film is BEAUTIFUL its one of my top 10 films in the world for me <br>best remake<br>just a complete masterpiece<br><br>Thank you Tim Burton
Disney dumbo and Brianna shead princess elephant 🐘 short
so far my FAVORITE live action remake
remember this isnt a remake its a reimagining
Is it just me or did Dumbo (2019) get forgotten almost immediately after it came out out.
Bill Burr sent me
i like it
I just watched this movie.  It had Tim Burton splashed all over it!  LOVE Tim Burton!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NiYVoqBt-8&amp;t=110">1:50</a> thought it was Johnny Depp😂
Totally cried like a baby.. felt like the movie was all about animal abuse. The ending was so nice lukily, cried even harder lol.
I&#39;m really glad they rebooted this movie. I used to like the old Dumbo movie but when I finally saw it clearly I realized it was a racist movie
Zad
The film has 2 cinematic Penguins
I was kinda disappointed in this movie cuz I expected for it to be a movie about dumbo but turns out it was about the kids instead. I expected better
Stop using synthetic fertilizer.
Wild Animals Don’t Belong in Circuses<br><br>Forcing wild animals to perform confusing tricks under threat of violent punishment is a barbaric practice that has no place in a compassionate society.<br><br>Animals in circuses have been either bred in captivity or taken from their homes and enslaved – solely for the purpose of entertainment. They’re condemned to a sad and frustrating existence, carted from one venue to another in cramped cages and barren trailers and trained to perform tricks to avoid being beaten or otherwise abused.<br><br>In their natural habitat, elephants walk long distances, swim, explore, play, and enjoy complex social relationships. But in circuses, they’re chained inside tents or confined alone to concrete enclosures, denied everything that’s natural and important to them.<br><br>Most big cats roam across large territories in the wild, so when they’re held in captivity, they frequently exhibit stereotypic behaviour, such as pacing, out of frustration.
Animal abuse!
It’s been this long??????????????
aww
I had just watched this last night for the first time ever and I have to say I was shocked because it was a pretty good, that&#39;s for sure.<br>Well at least I liked it. For remake it turned out pretty good and now I&#39;m waiting for Disney to do the live action movie for Snow White, who knows that one can turn out to be great as well.
They make me crying like a doggy❤️❤️❤️
Why was Vandervere&#39;s line &#39;Come with me. Together, we can soar on that elephant&#39;s wings&#39; cut from the film and not included as a deleted scene at least?
Sad
Greatest showman but for dumbo /neg
덤보엄마을과연만났을수기
Is reminder me from this movies like Netflix miss peregrine s home of peculiar children 2016 , Disney plus Alice in Wonderland 2010 and johnny Depp Alice through the looking glass 3d 2016,-05.
I hope they release pocahontas finally, too 😍<br>Dumbo made me goosebumps.
Have to cry anytime I see it.
I cry every single time I watch the trailer of this movie ….. and I haven’t watch it yet cause I know I’ll cry like a baby 😑😑😑😑😑
📞🙄😭
Don&#39;t use wild animals in circuses!! Horses and dogs love to do tricks, but lions, elephants, bears, or even orcas and dolphins shouldn&#39;t be captured to entertain people. Fortunately, they took animated animals.
I just finished watching this movie. Dumbo is so cute
Booking closed. Show starts soon ....<br>    Greetings - The Great Bombay Circus.
I absolutely love Dumbo so I thought  this movie will be great and I watched it and I found out it was great. It was all thanks to me if I wasn&#39;t thoughtful I wouldn&#39;t have watched at all
this is my fav childhood film i love it so much
This &quot;Dumbo&quot; directed by Tim Burton is actually better than Walt Disney&#39;s classic animated one. Because it was way too awkward and it also had rude people that nobody likes along with racism in it that effects people&#39;s lives so badly.
I actually watch this show to
Balelas: A morte do diabo surdo<br><br>E morreu o diabo surdo!<br>E ele foi se apresentar no céu.<br>Chegando-se ele à uma porta, foi questionado pelo porteiro: Queres tu a salvação?<br>E o diabo, rapidamente, respondeu: Quero sim!<br>Aí, lhe disse o porteiro: Mas se tu nem foste curado ainda, como é que me escutas, agora?<br>E o diabo, sem ceder, respondeu: Não, não! Deve haver algum engano. Eu sou cego!<br>Aí, lhe perguntou o porteiro: Então não estás me vendo?<br>E o diabo, daí, respondeu: Não.<br>Aí, o porteiro lhe disse: Então, vai tu para o inferno! Porque nenhum diabo cego chega aqui sozinho! Vai-te, arrepende-te e não peques mais.<br>E o diabo, murmurando, reclamou: Mas isso me será um castigo mui grande. Ao calor de brasas e a desertos áridos, eu até já estou acostumado! Inclusive, tenho ar condicionado.<br>E acordando o diabo, e vendo ele que era apenas um sonho, se perguntou: O que significa isso? Será que vai esquentar mais no próximo verão? E se eu me fizer de mudo? <br><br><br>Caraguatatuba, 17 de junho de 2018.<br>Fábio Luís Amaral dos Anjos
Yay casey jr isssssssssssss back

The awkward feeling when you relaise that a cute baby elephant, two wooden children actors, the Penguin, the Vulture from Spider-Man Homecomming and the director of weirdness, Tim Burton, made a better Live Action Disney remake, than Mulan&#39;s. And to think that Mulan had ALL the ingredients and the pontential of taking the beloved animated film and turn it into something epic!
Underrated movie 🤐💥
ออยให้น้องพลิ้มเพลาก็โฆษณานี้ไง.
They had to ruin it to make it more about the dumb humans that didn&#39;t even make the story better
In my opinion these movies are nothing compared to the drawn Disney movies they are much more exiting with voice actor and drawn characters
The police arrested the man arrested the man has received in a recess the resident arrested the list of them again
Dumbo the elephant
Is so cute i love away so i so cute
Dumbo is my favorite characters

Dumbo is cute crowd is ugly who exploit poor innocent defenceless souls.

disgusting circus with animals
Waw baby dumbo 🥺🥺😘dumbo☺️
Fun fact:dumbo is actually a man crawling
this movie looks awesome but Dumbo is so depressing. that poor elephant. 😓
We must find Dumbo unless it&#39;s a shape shifter which would amount to 180

after watching the movie I wanna watch it again
So dumbo cast has 2 Batmans and penguin very impressive 😅
Huh dumbo so cute i want to hug him
@):19 it says &quot;Jumbo&quot; instead of Dumbo on the banner, haha.

I&#39;m sorry, but the young girls personality and over all character was so cringe. :/ The movie would&#39;ve been much better without her in my own opinion.
This movie helps my soul
I&#39;m didn&#39;t really like this movie but dang it this trailer is beautiful.
This movie is incredibile 🤟🤟

The movie got lot of hate but I didn&#39;t mind this
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I can’t see the movie …. I am crying like crazy seeing even the trailer
I think this movie is very underrated
I liked the original version better!

There’s something about Tim Burton Disney remakes that really make them stand out compared to the others.  They don’t feel like cash grabs, they actually feel like they’re well executed and a sense of imagination
That ending makes me cry a lot.
My mom really loves that movie!
The music is sooo much good 👍 👌 👏 😍😍😍🥰🥰😘

I want to watch this with someone&#39;s daughter
yikes. this movie was not good
Im actually watching the movie now and i swear if they don&#39;t reunite Mrs Jumbo (yes that&#39;s DUmbo&#39;s mom&#39;s name) with Dumbo in this movie I&#39;m GOING TO BE PISSED!
I might be biased because i have a cleft palate which is a mouth defect but I find a baby elephant with giant ears REALLY CUTE! Plus aren&#39;t real baby elephants ears large compared to their bodies?
Tim Burton did an amazing job with this movie it just goes to show what a fantastic director he truly is and it made me cry especially the scene when Dumbo goes to find his mum truly brilliant

Is this a film about a flying elephant Dumbo. <br>Or is it about a female child that shows othere female children how strong and independent a woman can be, to seak there one way. And when things dont go there way, its a mans fault. <br><br>It is typical of disney now days to incorporate female feminism shit in their movies

The clown makeup on Dumbo completely broke my heart...I had to go back to make sure I wasn’t having nightmares!
I love the most I love so much I love them Damoh
The saddest thing is that Casey Jr only made one appearance in the movie and barely saw him again. And they really F##### him up. His smile looks straight out of a Creepy Pasta and he’s dirty as hell. What happened to him?!
😭😭😭￼
They made it unrealistic when they added the black girl, weren’t we living under segregation or something during that time lol

Who watching this trailer in 2021 anyone, I don&#39;t care what people said about this movie, this movie is a Masterpiece To Directed By Tim Burton
Why people hate this movie, they haters or what
Oh so cute
Who else cried when they heard “Baby Mine?”
I wasn’t disappointed in the movie. I actually liked how it was a retelling and not a shot-for-shot remake. But I found distasteful the fact that the movie focused more on the human characters than Dumbo.

I literally feel to kill all those bastards who do such crimes !!!!!! Separating a baby from his mother ??!!! What kind of dickheads do such immoral, illegal, and inhuman tasks ???!!! Its sad and it infuriates me when I see dickheads doing such crimes ... feel to just break their bones and hang them up in front of everyone .....
Its soo cutee
watching now
gente que fofo rsrsrs
Wow, so good to see Gabourey Sidibe still working.
Eva Green thoooooo
ITIS NAS VEDOV
😢😢😢😢😢so cute and sade
My honest opinion is that I didn’t care for it. Honestly I didn’t like what they did with the (SPOILERS) theme park. I thought it was very strange. I also felt it was strange how instead it’s more focused on the humans and the animals, instead of mainly dumbo and the animals. I’m sorry but honestly these remakes need to stop. I feel like we need something original. If you liked it then that’s fine, cause we can share our opinions without HATE
How come I not seen this movie before in Disney plus
Promoting animal abuse
What a great movie!!!!😭😭😭
Who else are here after watching the movie?
At first i thought Corrin farrel in the movie was a villain.

I Love Dumbo, shes adorable.. please respect elepants or any kind... please stop hurting them...

Beautiful movie for whole Family
No wild animals should be held in circus this movie is all about and treat animals as a family,please open your heart for every animals in this world,God Bless you and your Whole Family

Good old days in 1941.

Watching now, so cute Dumbo
The ending was so beautiful and necessary. Stop eating animals. They are mom&#39;s and son&#39;s such as we are. Don&#39;t hurt them ❤️
This must be the most beautiful trailer Disney has ever released

I love this Dumbo movie. It&#39;s heartwarming. I cried when Ms.Jumbo was locked in the cage and Dumbo missed her mother so much, just like the original did. Idk why I prefer this than the animated Dumbo. It just... different.. Yeah, and I love it, but the animation one was good actually. It&#39;s just only the children&#39;s acting that wasn&#39;t good entire this movie, but I am okay with that. <br><br>It&#39;s sad that most of people hate this movie very much and they said this movie sucks :&quot;(
Go vegan because that&#39;s the only way to stop animal exploitation and create a better world. Check vegan channels and <a href="http://nutritionfacts.org/">nutritionfacts.org</a> for more info on veganism and FACTS that EVERYONE should know. There are enough willfully ignorant people in the world, don&#39;t be one.

Fly Dumbo Fly <br>Me : 🥺
Tim Burton turned into a soulless Disney yes man since Alice in Wonderland, and it&#39;s the actual sad part in this movie
Dumbo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why did this make me cry?
Lord knows I love me some Dumbo, but this movie could of been way better.  Expected more from Tim Burton.  The whole Dreamland was so fake.  And the casting sucked!!!  But Baby Dumbo was adorable.
Hello i am from mauritius and i like his trailer film i want to watch this film any suggestion for a site ??
Anyone here After Elephant Incident in kerala
one of the worst movies ever
A lovely movie
What a piece of garbage...<br>Just like alladin and king leon.
When the looting starts
❤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This movie was fantastic and unencumbered expectation of what it <b>should</b> be and <b>could</b> be totally deflated the reaction that the film truly had. Earnest and sweet. Wondrous and triumphant. Like the best of Burton&#39;s films akin to Big Fish. The most honest of the heart of Disney&#39;s live-action adaptations. A shame so many wrote-it-off. This is why we can&#39;t have nice things. Because we take a film made with care and a sense of magic and kindness, and say it isn&#39;t good enough.
Super

So Batman and the Penguin are reunited.
I want to see it but but I don’t want to watch the sad pets cause I know I’m going to cry 😭😭😭
Fortunately, the public is increasingly realizing how cruel animal circuses are. There are so many ways to entertain ourselves without harmfully exploiting our fellow sentient species!
i really loved this movie its has melt my heart
Excellent extraordinary movie directed by Tim Burton I really get tears when dumbo is get separated from her mother Jumbo but it is an excellent movie and a good ending the most emotional is saying her mother as a mad elephant dumbo is trying to meet her mother but an excellent ending is been presented really a good story the two childrens are very looking so pretty and cute excellent cinema
❤❤😍
😍😭❤❤
Dumbo jest super🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎂🎂🎂🎂
Could have given Dumbo a voice-over in a child actor, as elephants are remarkably intelligent... could have made the magic feather come from a wing-clipped macaw (replacing the Crows).
Slippery, damp, moist.. dancing and singing
When I was in Thailand, I saw how they treated an elephant.. They&#39;re being force to work.. They&#39;re so skinny.. Unlike we usually see in TV, more bigger and fat.. But this one got lots of scars on their body.. Its even sad in real life.. 😔
I cried during the film. But really happy for the ending.. Such a wonderful film. Thanks for making it a happy ending.. Such a gud film... Love DUMBO.. Cutee...
The clown makeup on Dumbo&#39;s face  !!!! No, thanks. Im not watching this
This movie is so beautiful...❤️
ALL THE THING IS BELIEF
I’m watching the real dumbo
Dumbo is very cute
That&#39;s literally touching
Sukanti paul
Went to see this with my aunt and uncle and my aunt cried for most of the movie and I almost cried cause dumbo is so cute and how they took his mom away from him is so sad and wrong. Circus animals should be treated better and fairly
DUMBO AND  MOTHER  ARE SO SO SO SOOO CUTEEEE😍😍😍😍

Is Timothy in this movie?
Lol fake muscles the bike awaith 😁
Dumbo is not even the main character in this remake, and where is the mouse? And the crows that helps him fly? There is none of it. It was a bad remake because they made it more complicated than it really is. The best thing about the originals is that they told a heartwarming and deep story without having to put 3000 twist plots in it and having major problems all the time. This was overrated and I am personally very disappointed in the long awaited outcome.
I Watched the movie  it&#39;s so<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>HAPPY<br>HAPPY<br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY<br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY<br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY <br>HAPPY

What the hell I started crying at the trailer I definitely won’t make it through the movie

Meanwhile in the real world - elephants continue to be slaughtered to near extinction to satisfy the Chinese market for ivory. Pity Disney doesn&#39;t publicise that fact.
Not really a “kid” movie but 👍

this is fire
Ive only just now realized how disturbing this movie and the original is
Dumbo is definitely the correct answer!
who&#39;s my hero to tell me the name of the song\music playing from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NiYVoqBt-8&amp;t=90">1:30</a> ?????
half a#¤%d spoiler commentary and thoughts to &quot;dumbo&quot;/the Medici circus/the Farrier family the &quot;live&quot; action remake that should´ve been a sequel...<br>dumbo´s another remake that´s subpar to the original, i know real-ish looking animals don´t talk but i think it´s really what´s missing from the <br>movie.. and his little mouse friend which´s non existent... exchanging him for the kids?.. it´s ok to show the human parts of the circus but you <br>could´ve kept the animal parts as well. selling his mom?.. f#¤%´s that about?.. taking away &quot;her&quot; song and the tender moment between dumbo and <br>her... how about keeping everything with the animals from the cartoon and keeping some of the things with the humans from the live action version.. <br>right now it´s complete opposites.. the cartoon´s about the animals and the live action´s about the humans... why not skip calling it dumbo and <br>either give it the name of the circus or the family that the movie seems to be about... it´s laking the soul of the cartoon... also why not just <br>make the live action a sequel to the cartoon that begins right after?.. selling the mom in the beginning and then introducing the bad guys and it <br>wouldn´t be a problem, just skip telling the parts from the cartoon... have dumbo flying from the beginning. the audience could´ve watched the <br>movies back to back. the cartoon´s only an hour long anyway... why waste yours and the audiences money?.. i don´t get it... also dumbo should´ve <br>been drunk out of his mind hallucinating those elephants. no one else saw them, apart from the non existing mouse perhaps. most of it seems to be <br>a sequel anyway so why even include bits from the cartoon?.. just stupid... also if it´d been a sequel more about the humans it wouldn´t have <br>mattered as much if the animals didn´t talk. still missing the mouse though... but you´re based in hollywood and all studios in hollywood´re <br>running thin on ideas... next time you think remake throw water into your faces and go sequel! instead, or prequel in some cases. and why so much<br>focus on the feathers?.. he learns to let go of the feather in the cartoon fairly quickly... i´m glad i haven´t bought many of the remakes, don´t <br>think i´m gonna buy more of them either... i´m good with the og cartoons. think it´s the only way to get anyone to make sequels and prequels instead<br>of remakes, to not buy their crap... makes them work harder at coming up with new things instead of just treading water. did dumbo live happily ever <br>after, a flying elephant in the wild... that´s not worth anything... if you haven´t seen the cartoon than do that instead of watching this version. last, most<br>if not all of disneys easter eggs´re so dumb... some visible others only seen when they point it out themselves.... and they think they´re so clever.........
It&#39;s so cute

Though it didn&#39;t do well at the box office,i loved this movie. I adored it. It&#39;s mine favourite Disney remake.   <br>Hats off to Great Tim Burton sir.
Just watched this beautiful masterpiece ❤❤❤
Disney is only making remakes because they can&#39;t think of any new ideas but still want to get that cha-ching. If that&#39;s not sad I don&#39;t know what is.
Halfway through the movie and already starting to hate Milly. I gotta feeling they ruined this movie.
This movie was horrible
this film provides a lesson so that we no longer watch the circus and treat animals as best we can,,,,,, i reallllyyyy realllyy realllly loveeeee thiss filmmm

I don&#39;t care for Tim Burton movies.<br> There, I said it.

Dumbest Disney ever!!! This depressing failure of a remake made for... Who??? Please don&#39;t say children, they didn&#39;t even bother to put Timothy Mouse in this shitthole movie
se acabo la magia de burton
so no crows?
dumbo is a elephant
Dumbo barely felt like a protagonist in this movie.<br>Thr girl actress&#39; acting was lifeless tbh<br>The boy can be written out of the story and nothing would&#39;ve changed.
What happened to the crows? Cops shoot em?? 🤣🤣
Aww
Boring
RELEASE THE FULL AURORA TRACK! 😭🙏😤
I saw the trailer whe it was first released, but I never knew it was already shown in theaters.
I cried two times in the cinema and I’m still cryin
Unfortunately another movie that looks interesting, decent and even good in the trailer but once you see it... Meh.
I love Disney and I love animals. But I don&#39;t understand how is everyone so in love with this movie. It was awful! It was boring as hell and the acting... Jesus. I feel like I wasted hours of sleep. How can you cry with this? I didn&#39;t feel anything, just cringe.

Frankly I was expecting more from this movie because dumbo is such an epic but I cannot deny the movie was insanely sentimental
If you have seen the original, don&#39;t waste your time on this, it will leave you disappointed!

Even with such well-made films, must not in any way promote, support, advertise and tolerate any circus, show or the like in which any kind of ANIMALS are abused, used, trained, coached, keep in captivity and humiliated at all!
gg dambo

This movie is so terrible
Excelent movie for republicans to masturbate
I cried during the Original movie, when Dumbo and his mother were separated.  And I’m sobbing over the trailer. I don’t think I can see this movie. 😭😭😭😭🐘💕💕💕💕
Please Tim Burton do movie SnowWhite.  Cinderella. AliBaba. Sleepy hollow ².  Edward ² <br> feat Johnny Depp. <br>We love your works <br> imagination
Nice try Tim Burton your not fooling anyone you are about as family friendly as nightmare on elm street
I already saw it, the movie is very beautiful but I have an idea that such a bamboo that dumbo bambi and king lion that the movie 2019 already took it marked my childhood
I couldn&#39;t stop crying
I love you dumbow you are so cute 😍
I love the movie but the only problem is... there is no talking animals. Like why not make the elephants talk. <br><br>Disney should stop making animals look realistic and make it more accurate like the classics. Give animals some facial expressions and the ability to talk.
I don&#39;t think I can emotionally watch this. :(
Just got added to Disney+ (Nov 3d)
Lucunya
Eu gostei muito do dumba
It takes a special kind of stupid to think it&#39;s ok animals in circus or any other form of profit.

The film’s gloomy storyline and setting took away its element of fantasy. It’s supposed to be a feel good movie like Alladin but with the depiction of loss, poverty and animal cruelty, it resonates negatively to the viewers,  emitting a depressing feeling. That’s the tragedy and flopdoom of this movie.
This movie is 👏<br>I love this movie I really enjoy it. All Disney movies that are remakes are all nice👍👏<br>Nice movie DUMBO!!thanks DISNEY!

The new Dumbo reboot was at least more original than the new Lion King reboot.

i see this and i see big fish his touch in all his movies are so rare but yet his idk how to explain it like u can tell its a film by him ...&lt;3 true genius

This is the kinda trailer you’ll come back to in a years time or less
This movie absolutely SUCKED <b>BALLS!</b>  <br>I reckon they&#39;ll probably destroy Bambi next.
Here after Bill Burr told us about how he thought this was a kid&#39;s movie
Thank you Disney for making my childhood come to life again. This movie will always be my favorite. I can relate so much to dumbo and the pain of having his mother taken away. I was separated from my parents at a young age. I often felt like I was trapped in a cage looking through a whole wishing to be left free. This movie brings me so much joy I can&#39;t even put in words. Love you Walt Disney for all the beautiful and amazing things you have brought to my life.<br><br><br>- Thank you from a little kid who grew up wishing for a family.
Ok, so is it just me, or was I the only one who did not cry? I’m one of those people who are nostalgic, and I honestly didn’t care for the movie whatsoever. It is absolutely nothing like the old one, and I know it wasn’t meant to be a photo copy of it, but... I still didn’t care for it. I almost feel like Disney is trying too hard to bring back old cherished movies, and it seems like they are trying to “fix” them. If they aren’t broke, do not try to fix them. From Jungle Book to Marry Poppins... Disney needs to stop while they are ahead. Sorry for all the negativity, but that’s just how I feel about the new era of old animated and non animated movies.

Cannot wait for a chance to see this! I&#39;d never heard of it. I cry even watching the old animated movie. Can&#39;t wait to, like the other commenter said, die crying through a gorgeous reboot of DUMBO the baby elephant.
Disney showing kids how to become an autistic victim as an adult instead of a leader. 🤦‍♀️
Аладдин и Король лев Шедевр это просто божественно
Out of all the remakes Disney is coming out with, I think this one is by far the best.<br><br>And am I the only one that cries at the Baby of Mine song???

Perfect movie💛
Dumbo me gusta
I watcht this movie and i cried so <b>hard</b> 💞😔
I love adult Disney, f the kids.
Movie was so friggin forgettable that everyone forgot it existed.
Ok but did anyone suddenly just burst into tears at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NiYVoqBt-8&amp;t=95">1:35</a> ? Like what the heck??
Disney should&#39;ve released all of the original movies instead of wasting everyones time and money with all the live action crapathons.
That girl who play  Milly ruin the show next time find kid that can act alright?
I don&#39;t comment negatively on much but - the CGI looks just awful.  Why does everything need to be dumbed down and given human eyes?! The original Dumbo film wasn&#39;t particularly good (nostalgia makes it a little more bearable) - but why everything needs an awful &#39;live action&#39; remake I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not even &#39;live action&#39;. it&#39;s 100% CGI!
Make snowwiwhit 2
watched the original this week
I came here because AURORA
Looks nice
Such a sentive heart that i have,  my eyes come out  tear! beatiful film.
lol I saw the movie in a airplane good thing I was lucky ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is the cutest movie ever!
Esta película da dos reflexiones <br>1: Todo ser vivo somos capaces de hacer las cosas pese a nuestras dificultades <br>2: Muestra el lado obscuro de la humanidad, ningún ser vivo absolutamente nadie debe ser humillado ni maltratado, para la diversión de nosotros los humanos, ellos son como nosotros, diferente especie pero somos únicos en este mundo, nosotros debemos cuidar y respetar a todo ser vivo, los animales son inocentes, no los lastimen ni humillen, enserio es muy triste ver a dumbo pintado de payasito mientras el público rie de el, quisiera estar ahí para despintarle su carita, pero es más triste ver que esto pasa en realidad en nuestro planeta!!! Ellos llegaron primero merecen respeto, nosotros sólo somos secundarios en este mundo, somos invasores...<br>Amemos y respetemos a cualquier animalito que veamos.
I dont have See this movie :(
Pfff... circusses (?) without animals are the best cuz you see real &quot;magic&quot; instead of animals forced into things.
This movie is amazing 😍
I love it ❤️❤️
lawl i didnt even know this remake existed, let alone came out already. holy shit
super great work
YouTube full movie panamudiytha
Just finished watching the movie oh my fucking god that was easily the best movie I have ever watched from the start animal abuse to little guy losing his mamma and fighting to find her again wow good job Collin farrel easily the best movie you have ever played in truly touched my heart simple amazing
Me and my grand daughter is going to see this movie
I haven&#39;t watched the movie yet. But if it was that sad and great, why is the movie&#39;s box office so terrible, like only 2 times the budget:(((
I gotta be honest, this movie didn&#39;t make me cry as much as the cartoons. But this was such a great movie. As far as I&#39;m concerned Dumbo is better than Aladdin. Atleast this Dumbo captured its heart it gave justice to the cartoons. So many movies got snobbed this year, Dumbo, Alita, godzilla, detective Pikachu, Shazam.
Baby mine dont you cry.
Can I make a little contribution to the director please .. I&#39;ll be happy to..this movie is incredible...
Beautiful movie.. no words...will go down as one of the best family entertainers in the history...
Yeah, Disney, this sucked. Stop before you ruin all your classics.
When i see an elephant fly
Does&#39;nt matter how small, he&#39;s a fucking baby. Yeah its like, i thought you&#39;d be taller
Saw it in theatres at the beginning of April and watching it right now at home on Blu-ray. Prepared to cry all over again.
Tip guys<br>If u ever watch this movie u better have thousands of tissues<br>I never have even one so i warn u <br>After this u will have a pool

this isnt dumbo from my childhood tho tim just ruined it in the most beautiful way
Nah I didn&#39;t cry....where&#39;s my bravest man award!? 😑
Saw this movie, it didn’t even feel like dumbo. I was honestly disappointed and I know you can’t have the crows but that didn’t even make it dumbo.
Disney sucks.
Missing an arm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NiYVoqBt-8&amp;t=125">2:05</a> ?
Dumbo is so cute
bello sentimental siempre lo sera

This music already has me crying with only a few chords😭😭😭
Super ik ga hem zeker kijken 😀🥰💋😋🍿🍿🐘🐘
so sad
So cute
I can&#39;t believe Timothy only had a small cameo and didn&#39;t have a big role can we please start a conversation about that, please?
the saddest part is Rufus&#39;s death
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NiYVoqBt-8&amp;t=25">0:25</a> timothy? Is that you?
Damn all this comments about crying through the whole movie is the reason why I still didn&#39;t watch the movie yet...
This was so good I loved it
Ja to chorando
Bruh, the mouse doesn’t even talk!
Did you know?<br>&quot;In January 2017, it was announced that Will Smith was in talks to play the father of the children who develop a friendship with the lovable elephant after seeing him at the circus.&quot;<br>Thank goodness for scheduling conflicts lol.
The saddest movie I’ve ever watched...i literally cried so many times in the spectacular movie.

Please save animals from zoos and circus, animals are being savagely mistreated there :((
Netflix doesn’t even have this I’m done
This broke my heart as a kid when he was separated  from his mom because my mom was a drug addict in and out of prison.  It was such a traumatizing movie to me that i hated watching it.
E coloquei errado o nome e agora gente se vocês não sabem ler em português não não tem problema viu
eu amo o Dunga Ele é bem fofinho quando ele nasceu bem pequenininho e os olhos dele é são muito lindos é eu também amei o filme que eu tava assistindo lá na casa do meu amigo nela o marido da amiga da minha mãe aí ele já conseguiu baixar para assistir assistir não foi muito legal e eu também vou assistir o resto no cinema tá também vou assistir toy story que é muito legal também
AURORA needs to do all moviesongs😍
My grown ass cried while watching this movie now i want a dumbo for myself

i just realized (whyyyyyy) baby mine in the trailer is sung by the lovely Aurora
small elephants with excessively large ears can not fly as their ears would not support the body weight
Why isn&#39;t the mouse in the movie??
فيل يطير هههههه
Loved the movie but I kinda hated the little girl&#39;s expressionless acting lol
Guacht

Full Movie in this trailer
The trailer shows way to much of the movie
You all saying that the movie made you cry... Walt Disney is the one crying in his grave... i showed my kids the original creation, they LOVED IT!!! &quot;The mouse is funny! And the songs are cool! And the story is really about Dumbo.&quot; These are my kids critics... you lost your inner childs and it&#39;s sad, really SAD.
Muito bom

Subscribes please to my by now 🙂🙂😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😍😍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🤩😘😎😎😎😎😎😎
I have seen the movie today. Spoiler alert for those who haven&#39;t seen it yet. It was better than I expected! And after seeing so many good responses on the movie I already had high expectations. But Disney has outdone itself. Instead of just making a remake they reimagined the whole story leaving most elements although some were altered (although Timothy was shown as a white mouse in his suit in a cage his role was replaced by the kids, a lot of his lines were now done by the kids) and adding a whole extra storyline to it. That explains why it&#39;s twice as long as the original. I did find it funny that the ending was completely different. I wouldn&#39;t have minded if they would have left it intact. I mean, the original was made in the early 40s and the movie sets place around that time era and they weren&#39;t busy with integrating circus animals back to nature in that time, but then again I guess they have to choose political correctness for the crybabies who feel offended by the original movie. And yes I am very much for treating animals well and if possible getting circus animals back to nature or good sanctuaries. But I also understand that our knowledge about animals and animal cruelty has increased over the years and that what seems cruel to us (like a misunderstood mother and baby elephant now being the VIP&#39;s of the circus, yet still part of the circus, because of the baby&#39;s success during the show) wasn&#39;t perceived as cruel in the 40s. Thank God for the increase of our knowledge. But even if in this movie they hadn&#39;t send Dumbo and his mom back home into the wild I would have completely understood. It&#39;s something that would happen in 2019. Not in the 40s in which the movie takes place. Beautiful ending nonetheless, but I found it a little bit unnecessary to have a completely altered ending that doesn&#39;t fit in the image of the 40s. If they would have ended it with Dumbo and Jumbo now being counted as full family of the circus and treated well, it would have been okay with me. Not that this new ending isn&#39;t okay or beautiful, but unnecessary in my opinion.
Love this movie 😍
Tim Burton shows up and gets a paycheck. Should he give a shit? He probably does not if this film or Alive in Wonderland or whatever the fuck shits he dids the past 20 years. All these movies are for suckers.
Waiting......!!!!for this.

Omg, i’m already crying by just watching the trailer-
Best most saddest movie ever.
Just saw the trailer, the movie isn’t even released yet and I’m already crying!!! Looking forward to watching this movie soon❤️
Thanks for the spoilers-all you people who said you cried...Now I know I&#39;m going to.
The trailer only whispers of the emotions to come.
I&#39;m not sure if I want to pay and cry during this movie 😑
I love This Movie I love Dumbo 😥😥

Please release the soundtrack. Not baby mine song. The soundtrack is so amazing
movie sucks
The whole point of Dumbo was how he was alone and pushed through it but by the looks of the trailer the kids help him get his mom back not Dumbo
I&#39;m glad to see Danny DeVito reprising his role from Big Fish.
Me: Oh you are dumbo right?<br>Dumbo: YOU DARE CALL ME DUMB!!!
Dumbo was the most disappointing thing since my son
I hope they do a sequel to this Dumbo made me pretty upset when they separated him from his mum in this movie is so sad just like the Original movie at least they were happily reunited and sit back into the wild
AURORA!!!!
&quot;Fly, Dumbo.. fly...&quot;
Well the last movie doesnt matter much anymore but what were going to see today is the real question
Congratulation🎉$350 millions

Was any part of this scary? Trying to decide if our kids will like it or get scared. Sometimes Tim Burton makes things a little dark.

This trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice
Me la vi en cine
this was a good movie
Cried at how ugly this movie is, I’m disappointed in Tim burton
Nandu 😍
The end sad? (I would like to see the movie but i have to know first if the end is sad) <br>Text to me back please ❤
I get imotional and then cried.. Awesome feeling
Love you mom
Only love and peace make world better for live
i legit forgot this movie existed lmao
I saw picture of dumbo somewhere and thought this shit was from horror movie
Who needs a dragon when we have DUMBO 🐘❤
In Loving Memory Of <br>Walter Elias “Walt” Disney <br>(12/5/1901-12/15/1966)
Oh my gosh the TRAILER almost made me tear up. Imma be sobbing in the theater and not giving a f*** 😂
Who&#39;s here because of Bill Burr?
We saw this movie last night and we thought it would be kind of boring but it was Great! Worth watching our two year old son watched it as well ❤️
YOU CAN DO IT DUMBO WE ALL BELIEVE IN YOU! YOU CAN FLY!!!🐘❤
Dumbo made me cry at 3 yrs old when the 1991 VHS tape was released and it will make me cry again at 31 years old when I see Tim Burton&#39;s version. <br>Damn it dumbo ilysm😭😍
Itz so sad yes its only the trailer but I’m crying all those people who disliked it is a dumbo plus don’t make fun of her when she has the clown face paint
I&#39;ve watched this and it was beautiful!!! 🐘
This movie looks sad as fuck. Why would you pay to do that to yourself? I&#39;ll save you the time and money. &quot;Circuses are not what they appear on to be the surface.&quot; &quot;Animals are magical in of themselves, without having to be jazzed up. Leave them be.&quot;
I love this movie it made me cry When they separated Dumbo from his mum just like in the original movie but there are some bits in this film similar to the original and not And  the song baby mine reminds me of me and my mum she is Staying with my sister for awhile but I miss her so much and I love the movie tomorrow and I cannot wait for it to come on DVD
Dumbo is.a very good movie
Disney you think your slick in the scene where the momma elephant is caged and her name on the sign is “Kali the Destroyer”. Kali, the destroyer Goddess...  and how she turned on her Kali- Ma alter destroying everything . Aleister Crowley, and his evil, chaotic beliefs. I knew it the second I saw it.
I saw this movie today and I admit I really loved it up to the point I completely forgot it was a Tim Burton movie it just doesn&#39;t seem like something he&#39;d direct
Seeing that poor animal’s face pained like a clown makes me so fucking sad and ashamed as a human being . Makes me so sad that it would be in my mind forever. teach your children that animals belong to the nature . They didn’t came here to be our entrainment or food. <br>GO VEGAN 🌱

Nico Parker is the prettiest Girl on this planet

I watched this in the cinema and I just want to say how upsetting and touching it is. It’s almost like you know what dumbo is going through
I watched this movie yesterday and it was heart breaking but it&#39;s such a good movie

This movie made me: cry
I watched this movie today and a little girl asked her mom&quot; is that an Octopus&quot;?😂😂😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NiYVoqBt-8&amp;t=105">1:45</a>

When dumbo had clown face paint I thought we should treat  animals  how they are  not for entertainment
So sad omg
