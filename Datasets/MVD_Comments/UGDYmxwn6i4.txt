Pewds is real brave making these kinds of videos considering his own stream fails
What video was the original simp clip from?
Mr Beast is Better
Tbf to the anti-tipping streamer, tipping shouldn&#39;t be required restaurants should just pay their staff lmao.
pewdiepie is rich why does he still have a shitty camera
well what about SVEN
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=445">7:25</a> this is cute how he&#39;s love smacked

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=260">4:20</a> I&#39;m almost 3 years late to this. I finally could get fiber and can watch YouTube again. I&#39;m so lost on the last 9 years of internet because of fucking HughesNet.
Not PewDiePie reacting to a guy reacting to PewDiePie reacting to a guy reacting to some streamer 💀
Tipping in America incentivizes them to be nice. YES, America needs that😂
First clip PewDiePie reacting a guy who is reacting PewDiePie who is  reacting a girl. How many reactions are going on 😂😂
If a guy voice cracks while trying to fight so hard to convince he&#39;s 5&#39;7&quot;, he&#39;s a gnome.
I know what pewd likes the most CAKE FARTS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=623">10:23</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=664">11:04</a>
What has happend to you Felix
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=465">7:45</a> dude was probably talking to his kid lol. if he was talking to his partner, call the swat and get that man in an asylum .
pewdiepie reacted to a guy reacting to him reacting to a streamer reacting to ppl not giving her money from people reacting to her being a b*tch.<br><br>we have evolved.
E
The &quot;barrels&quot; option for what pewdiepie likes at the start triggers some deeply set old youtube knowledge that I can&#39;t quite place
Plot twist: there is n9 plot twist
On the never defend a women it depends on who the women is <br>If it’s your mom you have no choice <br>If it’s every other girl there is always a choice to not defend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=437">7:17</a> that tone the posture pewds is a S.I.M.P!!!
“BARRELS!!”
Reaction inception
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=487">8:07</a> THE CAMERA QUALITY 🤣💀
It’s called schadenfreude
BARRELSSSS what a trick question ogs
I love it when pewds screams for no reason
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=443">7:23</a> that dude probably be watching her stream hahaha
&quot;Geega Chad&quot; - Pewds
Why&#39;s his camera frame rate on 1 when he&#39;s watching the girl in the airport
What&#39;s PewDiePie&#39;s secrect to keep the eyes not being red after getting high as F...k during these 🤔
Critisizing tipping? LOL tips should be 50% - you wanna eat at a fancy restaurant and have waiters that serve you while you&#39;re acting as if they are your slaves? THAN PAY!
yea
The guy like FaceTiming someone was either trolling or just generally lovey dovey, like actual chad
The amount of nostalgia when Sive put in option c as Barrels(reference from outlast) is insane.
can someone link to a video in airport?😆
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=307">5:07</a> best moment of my life XDDDDD
This guys a spitting image of David de gea
How do you feel that cocomelon is beating you in subs?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=152">2:32</a> It&#39;s like when you face 2 mirrors at each other
I hate the Okay boomer song so much it&#39;s so fucking arrogant and annoying
Senzawa Recognized “A”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=203">3:23</a> that’s the cat’s way of telling her she sings like a b*tch in heat.
Pewdiepie reacting the guy reacting pewds reacting him of a stream <br> Wow 🤣😭😂🤣
What the fuck is wrong with the camera
Me Who Can&#39;t Afford NordVPN 😓
Mama Susan isn&#39;t putting any of Pewd&#39;s vid in my subscription feed...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=440">7:20</a> I thought he was watching the stream.
is this vid edited? I noticed the simp part of the video isnt here anymore lol

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=459">07:39</a> ha detto “prendilo prendilo”, è davvero italiano wow ahahaha
The idea of even comparing waiters not being payed a living wage and your job playing video games being funded by donations is so funny to me. Like aside from both involving money and jobs, they&#39;re two wildly, vastly different situations
It&#39;s a 4.25 hr pay before tips endless it&#39;s a locally owned company
Yes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=448">7:28</a> is that Evelyn Claire 😱😱

I am the late one I didn&#39;t know it till I watched this vid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=265">4:25</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=512">8:32</a> is so trippy lol
A youtuber reacting to a youtuber reacting to a youtuber reacting to a youtuber reacting
damn pewdiepie got that new 15 fps camera
I get the tipping one though, in america, tipping is kind of compulsory if I’m not wrong, its added to the bill or something right? While for streamers, its optional, the “customers” can choose whether to tip or not and there is no stigma against those who don’t donate
was this before the N
You gonna add the clip of you dropping the N word next time?...
The dude on the phone is probably just talking to his kids.
That was not yet a relea-
Lol the David dobrik bit 😂

thats cool but guess what
I love the first reaction of reacting to the  guy reacting to pewdiepie reacting to that guy
IDK if it was said, but yes people in the US make tips and a wage. Federal law says they should get paid about $2/hr if their tips plus the $2/hr is greater than or equal to minimum wage. If they don&#39;t meet that the employer is required to pay them minimum wage.
you can axcsssess
Did pewdiepie just insult me by saying I could affordit?
Is it I-KEY-AH or I-KEY-AY
I love how Pewds says &quot;so the video went viral&quot; and it has 18m views and this video has 18m views and this is not classified as going viral

pewds: i have 110m subscribers!<br>laggy facecam:  ._.
0 dislikes. This video is doing amazingly. Glad 100% of the population agrees with pewdiepie.
@pewdiepie I work in a restaurant located in Virginia, usa. We make $2.13 per hour + tips. I work 5-7 hour shifts and average $200 per shift in tips. 100% for the $2.13 go&#39;s to taxs. I don&#39;t get a check. I don&#39;t mind but it  who would turn down higher pay. The restaurant owners are the ones who benefit from the low wage for servers.

and this started covid lol
I&#39;d rather watch pewds and make my own decisions. if i wanna go outside i will. Sigmas chose to watch pewds, take notes people
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=405">6:45</a> if we didn&#39;t tip in the USA, Restaurants would simply have to raise prices. <br><br>People make way better money from tips, especially at good restaurants, than they would with a shit salary.
Bro pewdiepie looks more like enimem than Eminem
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=232">3:52</a> in real socialism, which Bernie would installed, she will go to work instead of making dumb videos on twitter

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=360">6:00</a> the difference is that restaurants don&#39;t depend on 2 dollar tips. They get over 90% of their money from normal orders. People donating on a stream is entirely optional, and you don&#39;t get shamed on for it.<br>Btw I&#39;m talking abt restaurant that disrespect you if u don&#39;t give a tip.
I can confirm odablock is 5,2

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=634">10:34</a> - this final ad kills me, especially how intense &amp; crazy Felix looks when he yells, “DEAL WITH IT”, the second time.  Literally made me laugh out loud as it was expected but unexpected ... 🤪

Just think about laughing at this man in his 40s maybe 50s being all fuck the rest of the world I don&#39;t care I am who I am and he has someone who is at least interested in him. HE DID WHAT MOST NEVER ACHIEVE AND YOU LAUGH AT HIM. Just shows how judgemental and sad your life&#39;s are

He&#39;s at a smash bros tournament and that switch is owned by the tourney organiser. That player just opened the album out of curiosity.<br><br>Whats funnier is the ayer then went to check the custom stages in smash on that switch which, as it turns out,  were also of similar... theming

The tipping argument is so dumb<br>Big fucking difference between socially pushing customers to pay so you can give your employees a third of an actual salary<br>And getting money from people who send it of their own volition cause you&#39;re providing them with entertainment they don&#39;t mind paying for
Alinity is racist ?
Pewds reacting to the guy who reacts to him who reacts to the same guy.
Tipping isn&#39;t that bad, at least we save those in taxes! (depends where)
Respect to the lag
Theres a deku on the thumbnail 😭
I actually found a sponsor funny for once…

pewds needs nord bc he doesnt want anyone to see his history lol
That advert was a fail
the quality on this video top noch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=154">2:34</a> WTF xD
Tipping is a means for restaurant/nightclub owners to avoid responsibility and underpay their staff, relying on their customers to do their job for them.<br>America, take example from the smarter countries like Japan, the Netherlands and most Scandinavian ones. Assume responsibility.
I wonder how the dobrik stans are reacting knowing the can’t cancel pweds
is it just me or is pewds&#39; camera lagging at 24fps?
hej pewdiepie hur mår du förresten stort fan älskar din humor, du är ärlig
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=50">0:50</a> Yes, but you have to pay UPFRONT for 2 years or whatever. That&#39;s what some people can&#39;t afford.

Who is reacting to who in the first clip??????............I am confusion
Love that part about the tipping and streamers. Fucking hypocrite got rekt
4 people on commentary.
the truth is people who make tips usually get way more than minimum wage unless they have shit personalities. and a lot of it is untaxed because they have to report the tips they get and unless managers are strict they usually let them just report a certain amount and pocket the rest.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=330">5:30</a> please tell me he has a youtube channel he seems funny af

I have been subscribed for awhile but haven&#39;t watched a single video from Pewds so I am happy I started with this one.
So he&#39;s a streamer streaming while watching a streamer stream another stream while streaming a different stream by the same streamer?
Did PewDiePie do a dobrik dig with the intro for sponsor ?

I cringed when I saw Evelyn Claire (even though it was funny)
I work for tips and may I say it sucks. I am a bagger and some don’t tip so it’s a waste of a day so for that guy to hate on tips got what he deserves
He was reacting to someone, reacting to him, reacting to someone, react to someone else
Just so you know, unless you job is volunteer work or court mandated work(you committed a crime and you have the choice of jail time, or a certain amount of hours of work), you always get at least a minimum wage.  The thing is, tips are awesome.  The average minimum wage in America is around 12.00 per hour, and tips can easily pay more than that.
Neeko lul is so cringe yet she has so many simps
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=443">7:23</a> the guy look like setien the fc Barcelona manager in 2018

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=453">7:33</a> he laughed so hard that his fps dropped like the US governments reputation when Donald Trump was elected.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=598">9:58</a> imagine if this guy watched this video<br><br>he was applauded by pewdiepie

People can get paid under minimum wage if they get enough tips to make up for it

This was a bit confusing :-D Sometimes I forgot who was reacting to who, lol
In case you are wondering the cameraman’s number is no longer active
The first one is like .... Reaction to Reaction to Reaction to a video &amp; I&#39;M watching it !!
Why so much asking for likes and sponsors all over the place did I miss something
It happened, I just watchend a reaction to a reaction to a reaction to a video.
Pewdiepie: laughs<br>Frame rate: Adios
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=451">7:31</a> wait the dude on the back is talking Italian
How ironical
He really called his sponsor boring and they still paid him. Thats alpha moves
thats a paradox! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=140">2:20</a>
It all so confusing for me Bebe brein
Ok, but tipping a restaurant worker AFTER already paying the restaurant is pretty different than a twitch sub.
She copystriked her cat
If someone gives EXEMPLARY service and you WANT to tip them then it&#39;s your prerogative. But requiring tipping is taxation without representation. -.-
Yea live stream fails remember the bridge lmao

You get a low wage as a waiter but you get pretty much all the tips (split amongst your coworkers). But you know who works for tips and tips alone in America? Strippers. No joke.

I really hope Twitch ban Alinity for her poor treatment of cats. I know it doesn’t really relate to the video the Alinity clip just reminded me. Twitch needs to stop simping and start using their brain
It makes me genuinely happy to watch the cat get revenge for Alinity for all the times she has abused her cats
UH, THATS FUNNY -pewdiepie like 5 times
The bite sound was 10/10

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=463">7:43</a> maybe he was  talking to his little kid and wife? and he was just playing with his little baby?

What do you like?<br>Watching people suffer<br>Sven .-.
In the U.S. wages have been stagnated since the 1980s, meaning that while production has skyrocketed amongst the workers the ones pocketing the profits are the richest people in the country. What&#39;s worse is that they&#39;ve convinced the population to believe that raising their wages would be bad for everyone.
Felix now looks like the child of Eminem and DJ Khaled if Cocaine was involved

IDK why but I just die when watching the part about the streamer&#39;s height. I&#39;ve probably watched it 30 or 40 times but every time I absolutely laugh my ass off.
Tipping can get you a night better than your wages if you&#39;re lucky enough, its the risk of working that job.
NORDvpn leaks DNS...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=120">2:00</a>  We are literally watching a reaction video of a reaction video of a reaction video...<br>...<br><br><br>We need to go deeper.

The tipping situation is dogshit 😂 I’m not a streamer so I can criticize it. Saves restaurants a margin amount of cash. Shitty system that shouldn’t exist. I am already paying for my food, why tf do I have to give someone money when all they did was bring it out to me? I’d go out back and get it myself if it means I could save $10 without having the manager come out and ask me what’s wrong. <br><br>What’s wrong is that you pay your servers $2 an hour and leave it up to the customers to decide whether or not they get to pay rent this month. So shitty. I never tip and never will lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDYmxwn6i4&amp;t=442">7:22</a> Yo is that Evelyne Claire ? 😂😂😂
Tf happened to his cam xD
The Simp Bernie girl looked like Lionel Messi on Faceapp at first glance
It depends on if your good as a waiter some people make a lot more then they would even Makin 15 an hour but personally that kinda shit would be too stressful for me
