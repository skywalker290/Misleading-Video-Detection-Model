Game&#39;s still here 4 years later🤣
They made a javascript version of this
Happy Wheels song is a banger
GUYS HAPPY WHEELS IS BACK GO PLAY GAME YOU CAN SEE HE IS WEARING
Grah
pewdiepie, tobuscus, dantdm, and markiplier all raised me when my parents refused. always grateful
The saddest thing is that Björn will never experience Happy Wheels
I&#39;ve been a regular viewer since 2011. I was 18 back then. How time flies...
3 years later happy wheels is still here 😂
My childhood
Someone made a happy wheels song. It&#39;s called all the way.
How nostalgic...

Me playing happy wheels today: (Laughs in HTML5)
Holy shit it actually is his old mic, ty yt reccomended
it works with HTML 5 now.
pewdiepie: get shattered into pieces <br><br>also pewdiepie: i think im dead
How have I missed this one?! The nostalgia is overload.
Ahh the good old days... When pewds was constantly mean to his imaginary son. Looking forward to the future when he can terrorize his actual child. &lt;3
I’ve been here since first happy wheels!! Still makes me laugh 😂
Been watching PewDiePie since I was 11. I’m 22 now time flies
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Your mike is loud
I didn&#39;t want this video to end...
Imagine if he found out it never got Deleted as the dev managed to convert the game into the new HTML5 program
Imagine if he found out it never got Deleted as the dev managed to convert the game into the new HTML5 program
After the 10 first minutes of the video, I can at least say that I haven&#39;t laughed this much over a PewDiePie video, for almost a decade!<br>Edit: Enjoyed the entire video! Thanks for posting this. So much fun!<br>Also regarding about not editing your happy wheels videos. Well, it wasn&#39;t really necessary xD!
thank the creator of happy wheels for making a new version
one of my favorite videos now , this was hella nostalgic
Bitch lasagne has nothing on this godly video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=155">2:35</a> i thought there was a dude just wearing pants laying on his back behind him
Imagine if you were one of the people who thought the end of Happy Wheels was going to be the worst thing to happen in 2020
I remember watching this back when I had a bed time. Now I am an adult and I go to bed when I WANT MOM!
i would watch these videos all the time. such a nostalgia trip.
Does anyone Remember…. <br>YES  <br>we remember 🥲🥲
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=580">9:40</a> Reminds me of the Vespa bit :D
I&#39;m just getting around to watching this and holy crap the nostalgia: the subtle throwbacks make me smile :)
omg I just realized that this video is posted on my birthday, omg I&#39;m very happy thank you pewds
The nostalgia this video brought it unreal. I actually went back to old happy wheels I watched when I was in middle school and didn’t regret it. May have shed a tear
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=602">10:02</a> Schmoyoho <br>ALL THE WAYYY!!!
those nostalgic voices, tho<br>&quot;I became a FOUNTAIN because you DisapPOINT me&quot;

I bought my computer to play happy wheels
Are they getting rid of happy wheels wtf man
You used to love the swinging levels
let&#39;s be honest it&#39;s probably for the best that this game died
Seems like forever since i heard James&#39; scream
Woahhh i miss this
It’s insane to me that I have actually never watched a PewDiePie video throughout this damn near decade I’ve been on YouTube. This won’t be the video I actually watch, I’m just not a fan, but goddamn can I respect the HELL out of this man.
The front flip joke makes me smile
I played happy wheels yesterday lmao
good old dayzz
you lied to me pewds
I stuck with you bro 😎
i didnt even know there was a possibility for 3 unskippable adds
I´d love to watch the old content
Why does he look like Mr beast in the thumbnail?
I thought he was joking with the mic qualitt at first but he&#39;s actually seriously going to use it for the whole video lol.
i donno if anyone realizes but he satys &quot;frontflip backflip, bu dad that was a backfli- shut up&quot; does anyone remeber that?

I discovered pewds when I was in elementary and now Im in college. I was watching this youtube video and I checked the comments and one comment said  that &quot;pewds should do this&quot; and I checked him out and about 9 years later here I am :)
he says game not fun anymore but he can still enjoy some way.

Ông là chúa hề của năm :)))

HAPPY WHEELS!!
Pewds: &quot;Does anyone remember this?&quot;<br>Me who has been part of the Bro Army all these years: &quot;salutes as Pewds Vet&quot;
I love how he still remembers the Dad/Son improv he used to do! Felt so good.<br>Also, anyone else getting recommended this in 2021?

Yes I remember this pewds
He did not speak the original son voice (u know the father , son in a cycle )
Does back flip calls it a front flip * child’s voice “but dad” dad voice “shut up son” pure childhood memories right here ily pewds
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=250">4:10</a> twist it, pull it
The microphone makes this video 10X times better 😂😂
i liked these videos because i liked watching pewds have fun, it wasnt really about happy wheels
6ix9ine million views
i can still download happy wheels
I think the big part of the Hype behind Happy Wheels was because at that time and before that, games required your imagination to fill in a lot of the blanks, and now, games don&#39;t rely as much on your imagination, because you can get outstanding graphics and animations to fill in the blanks.
To be pro, you actually need to be able to land the &quot;bottle flip&quot;
I’m a 2021 future person and happy wheels is not cancelled on mobile

Lol
Who&#39;s watching this in 2021?  Actually curious
Anyone here after Flash version go bye bye?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=385">6:25</a>...<br>control or shit???
It is after December 31st and and they did not shut down even though flash are down for some reason it didn&#39;t
It&#39;s now Decemner 31st 2020. And Happy Wheels is still not dead, it&#39;s on a hold until the HTML5 replacement appears.<br><br>Clearly you are speaking shit, Pewds.<br><br>(Nevermind: Happy Wheels&#39;s Javascript version saved the website and the game)
JAVASCRIPT COMES IN CLUTCH
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=534">8:54</a> but you can actually have 10 furnaces

Happy Wheels, I seriously swear, those were THE GOOD TIMES!!!!
Happy Wheels, got damn old and great times
week until the day😔 end of an era
i&#39;m amazed how much subscribers you have
PewDiePie<br>how dare you say this game bad.
Tobuscus made a Happy Wheels song, it’s called “Get Bloody”
I know this video is so old but the way that felix always makes an italian accent (or just saying italian words) when he is &#39;talking&#39; in spanish will never not be funny to me.
Happy weels didn&#39;t shut down
pewds : &quot;Does anyone even remember this&quot;?<br>Me : &quot;always&quot;
I remember when pewds use to put a brofist in his description
Good videos Rubius Omg

Pewds always the best at happy wheels
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=535">8:55</a> does a backflip bus says he done a front flip 🤣
i never got to watch the full video because i was laughing so hard
I cant bear to watch all this I&#39;m not emotionally ready
why does the sofa behind Pewds look like a guy without a shirt and green pajamas sleeping?
man this brought me back to when my brothers and i would hide in the closet and watch your old happy wheels videos because my parents didnt want us listening to someone curse lol now my parents watch your videos with us lol

&quot;Did anyone make a happy wheels song?&quot;<br>Tobuscus: Am I a joke to you?
IT ISNT. look on the total jerkface website
Porque no le pone subtitulos en español? :c
Pewdiepie is overrated.
I&#39;ve known Felix for about 6 years not personally obviously but I&#39;ve watched all of mark and Sean&#39;s vids and I figured I&#39;d give Felix a try and regret not watching him sooner

I remember the good days of being in class on a computer and being bored turning this game on and forgetting my volume was at max
Pewdiepie:we&#39;llgo together <br>Me:*waiting for he was like a father to me*
“It’s loud” JUST WHAT HE SAID IN THE FIRST EPISODE.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=10">0:10</a> anyone here who went to video quality.<br><br>after some seconds:no It&#39;s fine.😑😑
Audio: &quot;It&#39;s evolving, just backwards&quot;
Pewdiepie: I&#39;m the best ooo look front flip<br>He does a backflip<br>Me: Bruh
Why am i crying
All of the new fans dont know this
My mom walked in at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=590">9:50</a> and I had to frantically explain that I wasn&#39;t watching porn 😂😂
&quot;I became a fountain because you disappointed me&quot;
why pewdiepie have the same haircut than me
I remember spending hours creating happy wheels levels and experimenting
soy de México y esto me insulto
I met you at 14 after school when searching for conspiracy videos about Talking Angela. I watched your Talking Angela video and I’ve stayed subscribed ever since. I binged all your old stuff (and I mean ALL of it) and all the recent stuff you had out then. Now 7 years later, this made me feel 14 again. I outgrew many youtubers, but you were always among the ones I stayed consistent with. As common and cheesy as this is to say, I wanna thank you for growing with me through the toughest decade of my life. Thank you, Felix 💖
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=117">1:57</a> did he just predict the future??????
i liked the part when you weren&#39;t funny for 25 mins straight
I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever stop with Happy Wheels. He keeps coming back every once in a while.<br><br>I mean it&#39;s 2020!!! The last episode was supposed to be in 2013. Haha!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=1124">18:44</a> of course it&#39;s nostalgic. You actually played this level on your first video of Happy Wheels. Lol!
But dad??<br>It&#39;s the best thing I have ever heard!!
i remember coming across his channel in 2011 when he played happy wheels all day.
Her: he&#39;s probably thinking about other girls<br><br>Him: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=576">9:36</a>
wow it’s like i’m twelve again
Cool now is audio matches his video quality
He doesn&#39;t have that nerveous swedish accent anymore.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=915">15:15</a> the graphics  are so beautiful <br>Minecraft: understandable have a great day
Omg his speaking the language of God&#39;s
Pepperoni ... :&#39;(

I remember having to hide my laptop screen in the dinning room from my mother so that I could play this game
Chotiya

This brought out a lot of dormant emotions
Pewdiepie: I RESPECT WAMAN<br>Also Pewdiepie: Removes a woman&#39;s head from her body and says ,&quot;oops.&quot;
2020 really is the worst year
All the nostalgia omg
I smiled when pewds said frontflip but he did a backflip
I smiled when pewds said frontflip but he did a backflip
Watching him spit random Spanish gibberish made my day
Pure nostalgia right here

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=319">5:19</a> wow never got a rim job that made me scream
I miss the good old pewds man Stephano man 😂😂💀 such better easier times I’m sorry to say I don’t like what’s become of pewdiepie but I’ll never forget all the great stuff he did and the fire watch video man that was impactful
Top 10 proof that 2020 is the end of the world<br>1-Happy Wheels is shutting down in 2020
Just woke up from a coma, glad to see that you’re still making the same content!
Saying front flip instead of backflip just brought back all the og memories
his mic is nearly as bad as his camera quality, nearly
chrome: NO MORE FLASH<br><br><br><br>All the flash games:* fading away * <br><br>Happy Wheels: I didn&#39;t really die
Why are we still here just to suffer?

I always liked whenever you’d do a backflip and would say <b>F R O N T F L I P</b>
<b>B A R R E L S</b>
The first level that he played in this video was also the first level that he played in a very old episode. He didn&#39;t even realize it

Dude this video just shows that Pewdiepie really hasn’t changed. He’s still there. He’s just more mature, and doesn’t play games anymore
When you see a blonde British man with vampire powers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=302">5:02</a>

Omg you’re not an OG happy wheels if you didn’t complete the pokemon course with every single character 😂😂
I started with happy wheels been subscribed ever since and now I need more.
These were the first videos I watched
pewdiepie&#39;s I DON&#39;T CAAARRREEE,brings so much flashbacks in my head...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=534">8:54</a> does a backflip and calls it a frontflip
is pewdiepie stuck with 103 subs!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!
Been watching since happy wheels, picked you over tobuscus cause you swore and I found that hilarious
I hope he brings his legend intro and outro as well,, but what can i do. This is enough to make me smile, watching pewds playing this game again, after a long time.
Of course we remember all the reference you made. Also you used to call the son Timmy! Was waiting for that xD This brings back so much nostalgia and memories and I&#39;m glad I stuck with you throughout all your phases. (Even tho I&#39;m lagging behind on videos but I&#39;m catching up lol)
We’re together now, we’re on this journey together <br>- 9 year old army
...I&#39;m gonna miss Happy Wheels, I feel like I&#39;m 12 again, Felix...<br>Edit: Pewds, happy wheels isn&#39;t dying &lt;3

Jack made a Happy wheels song
I still remember felix yelling &quot; I DON&#39;T CAREEEEE!&quot; the good ol happy wheels days. Now its going to be gone.
Felix: Does anyone remember this?<br>Snape: ALWAYS
Genuinely emotional! Just the memories of watching Pewds back in the day and Happy Wheels marathons 🥰

This is VERY important for everyone to know. Jim Bonacci stated that Happy Wheel will NOT be cancelled. A Javascript version of the game is being worked on, &amp; we can all still play even after the day Adobe cowardly gives up on everyone. HAPPY WHEELS WILL LIVE ON!!!

STEPHANOOOO MY OLD FRIEENN
&quot;Has anyone ever made a Happy Wheels song?&quot;<br>All The Way: am I a joke to you?
I think your old happy wheel videos are what made me subscribe. It’s sad that it’s shutting down
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=767">12:47</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😭😂😂
Pewds: Hailey says the n word every day? I will kill her!<br><br>The media: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that.
Here since amnesia days ✊
Felix: “does anyone even remember this?”<br>The bro army si still there Felix. Stephano will still be in our heart.
This quality is 10/10
In ten years from now he&#39;ll be doing the same exact thing with minecraft which is honestly just really sad knowing that videogames do have lifespans and we never really know if they&#39;re no longer fun until they&#39;re just not anymore
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=14">0:14</a><br>Блйять?
Pewds spanish is terrible 😂
I like Godwin the Goat.
Bro, i miss you u.u
Happy wheels is not shutting down a java version is in the work
I can’t stop 😖😖😆😆😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
me watching pewdiepie old videos because he left:<br><br>also me:𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴
Literally everone in the comments using this format:  &quot;does anyone even remember this&quot;<br>                &quot;Of course we do Felix!&quot;<br><br>Me seeing this format that is in every single comment section:       .    .            Again?<br>                   <i>_____</i>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=540">9:00</a> <b>Yes.</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=1352">22:32</a> is the anime betrayal.
Happy Wheels montages got me to start watching Pewds. Haven&#39;t stopped since. I&#39;m happy he did this video before it ended.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=600">10:00</a> &quot;Has anyone ever made a Happy Wheels song?&quot;<br><br><br><br>Jacksepticeye crying in the corner
Calm down it’s not shutting down it’s making a java version so it doesn’t disappear for good
&quot;Did anyone ever make a happy weels song?&quot;
Great ^_^.......
Hi !
Bringing the memory
gott nytt år:)
everything just flashback when i watch this video
No sé qué ago aquí pero veo a alguien que Abla English y es coje el spanish sorprendente :o
Кто русский лайк
I strategically left like 12 videos of pewds unwatched so when he left I’d still get regular new videos. I’m sad to announce this is the last one left. I saved happy wheels for the big finale. Now I’m sad and it’s time for pewds to come back
the nostalgia is real
Plot twist: He lied
My child hood
Haven’t laughed so hard in so long 😂
Death comes to us all
Just download happywheels O/L with level creator
Epic
I miss the old days when pewdiepie still played video games
Happy wheels is now on Android
Slenderman, Amnesia, Happy Wheels... where has the time gone? I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve all come this far.  That&#39;s wild man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=384">6:24</a> Pewdiepie said control or shit
the news about happy wheels being cancelled is fake
#<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=141">2:21</a> the best part 😂 hahaha<br>#<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=257">4:17</a> i cant stop laughing ..this Pogo part killed me
Мой уровень испанского
LOVED Slender. First PC game that I actually downloaded.
Frontflip!
Peweiepie Is a better youtuber
Thats so funny
I remember coming back from school to watch Pewds play Happy Wheels and now I&#39;m coming back from work to watch him play this.. time flies by so fast.
a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
the final level made me cry with laughter
1 month later: Pewdiepie is canceled
The final episode of happy wheels... Damn
🇹🇷🇹🇷 türksün gurur duy türk olanlar buraya 1+
Türk olanlar buraya
They dont suck life ig
Lol I remember watching these 8 years ago
The shitty microphone took me back to when I was ten.
Why did I not watch his vids back then?
Ho capito tutto
This makes me feel things, being a grown man, watching you play Amnesia mods and this crap coming home from work, how times have changed.
This is so sad<br><br><br>Alexa play despacito
“Does anyone even remember this?” <br>We have stayed the whole time, so yes we remember.
Español<br>Browfist
You, jacksepticeye, and all of the other youtubers I watch and am subbed too have inspired me to make a YouTube channel thank you🙏
You’ve played most of the maps that Sean played
How could we forget this pewds!!!??? Awe I miss the good old days
Do I remeber? I&#39;ve been here since penumbra 👴
Come back
He hated all the levels he used to love and loved all the levels he used to hate
The word frontflip still brings back memories to this day.
Give me your original content boi
Não tem legenda br &quot;-&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=601">10:01</a> im eating
good news: happy wheels is not dying! Probably a few saw it on the website that they made a javascript version of it so it won&#39;t die with adobe flash.
Pew:I want to suk u up<br>Us:that&#39;s what she said
Pew:massage my back leg
Why do I remember like half of these levels lollll
PewDiePie on bed
okay I&#39;m crying
Goodbye bros its been a good decade
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=63">1:03</a> Logo guy dies of pepe loss
Really missed HW.
Yea but their making another version thats non flash
love/hate relationship with having been watching him since he was playing this... this whole video I was like &quot;this was peak entertainment?!&quot;<br>but also this was highkey funny but it might be nastalgia
jajajajajaj pewdiepie no sabe diferenciar entre español e italiano jajajaja
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=1199">19:59</a> PewDiePie finds bridge. Everybody in a chat holds their breath.
Pewds :Does backflip while saying &quot;frontflip&quot;<br> <br>Me : crying .
Such nostalgia...
I Am Italian and I love when you speak italian
Me i watch you scream your lungs out
This SANDWHICH doesn’t have turkey in it
Русские где
As the creator said, happy wheels is not getting deleted, they&#39;re gonna make a java version of it
Of course I remember that. &quot;But dad, that was a backflip!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t CAAAAARE!&quot;
NOO HAPPY WHEELS NO
this is so fucking wholesome man been here since like 2014 🥺
I&#39;m glad Pewdie made it but I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t miss the low budget playthroughs
Still calling backflips “front flip”
Any body remeber DONT FLAG THE VIDEO
Just why. You dont need it. People that do labour jobs need this not u on your ass whole day making videos whsy tf u think u are
Honestly advertising energy drinks is is like making a burger advertisement for fat 0eople so they get more fat
You need rice and meat not this shite like wtf
Excuse me but wtf is the point of an energy drink pointed at gamers
Nostalgic
I remember waiting everyday for a new Happy Wheels episode. I&#39;ve been a Bro, part of the Bro Army, a Nine Year Old, and a Nineteen Year Old. Man, times flies
Here’s a pun for you<br>Happy new wheels!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=709">11:49</a> - FATALITY!!
wholesome nostalgic video until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=1368">22:48</a> and extreme flashbacks occured
this hit me right in the nostalgia<br><br>The amnesia level especially
chairmode activate foreshadowed the $399 chair this whole time
Cool man
pewdipie i learn English from your old gameing videos its so sad when i realise that time can&#39;t be back when i laughing at your hw videos and waching your horor videos all night (2013 &lt;3) ;))
Loved it then, loved it now!
Its not
A good old game with the same audio quality back then
This is the first time I heard about this game. At least I saw Pewds play it before it got cancelled
This isn’t the same

Pewds &quot;does anyone even remember this&quot;<br><b>Cries is stephalo</b>
Funny how Happy Wheels is going to be cancelled, and Jim has yet to release Divine Intervention 2. GG!
Man this is sad. I remember watching you play this Pewds. Good times. Hate the new YouTube algorithm
You are wrong sir
when i say pewdie you say pie pewdie..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=398">6:38</a> I thought there was someone shirtless lying on his bed in the background<br><br><br>Like if u see it
LOL funny Pewds I liked this video yes!!!! :)

Someone has been listening the lonely island lately hahaha
Pewds: &quot;I&#39;m crying on the inside*<br>Me: <b>I&#39;m crying on the outside</b><br><br>A new decade begins bros
Yes EVERYTHING is back to the way it was its not like someone left YouTube
Solo yo estoy como pendejo por que no estoy entendiendo ni madres que dice
Damn, I do realize I joined the channel too late when he makes jokes and I don&#39;t even know who is stefano
The voices bring back so many memories
One question. Why does ur son sound like Carl wheeler?
bruh
sub to lazarbeam
Didn&#39;t he play the same level at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=400">6:40</a> years ago?
For once he sounds normal and not exaggerating again
This hurts
No u
seeing the happy wheels papers please reminded me of all of the fun times i had playing that game when I was younger. So I bought it again while watching this video.
Can’t wait for the next Fridays with pewds :333 xDDDDD<br><br>/s
You&#39;ve played the App right?
So many memories!!! I think the first PewDiePie video I watched was Happy Wheels! YouTube was so much simpler back then! Come home from School, watch the lastest PewDiePie and KSI videos then watch the lastest Vine compilation video while &quot;doing&quot; homework! Great Times!
Just like old times. 4 Years ago...
E<br>E<br>E<br>E<br>E
Nope it isnt
You have been misinformed.
Hey guys we should get pewds to playthe new happy wheels Guts and Glory
Hey Guys!!!!! it is not going to be cancelled!!!
BlaD_BochaR TOP!!!
Кто от Витька? (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=457">7:37</a>)
Да, тут тоже есть русские, ты не один<br>Залайкайте, чтобы не русские подумали, то, что я написал что-то смешное.
Nostalgia. The happy wheels video days.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=457">7:37</a> BlaD_BochaR is russian guy.Vlad Bochar
This was probably where pewdiepie got a very huge chunk of subs, ant believe he forgot lol
Happy wheels is not gone they will make a Java version for it it&#39;s on the website
Damn that nostalgia
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=830">13:50</a> is it just me or does that smile hit different

Join the cult
what&#39;s this game name
This made my day
Fun
We need to start a petition to get the game ported to Steam. I don’t care if they charge full price for it. We’re already loosing flash games I’m not going to loose Happy Wheels too.
Why can’t they just make it as a downloadable game on steam?
<b>Pewdiepie makes back massage noises, as mom walks into room.</b>
When i was four (yes four) i remember watching you play happy wheels with a pokemon level<br>Now i’m 16 and thanks for all the years of content Felix ❤️
&quot;does anyone remember this, has anyone stayed with my channel this long?&quot;<br>Been here since 2012 and it feels like yesterday.
I’m getting some high quality Vietnam flashbacks rn..
You can still play it, flash just won&#39;t get updates
Little thought for the creators who surely thought that Pewds would never play to their level. And he did it right before the end ! :)
Started watching in 2012 and I’m actually 19. This hits so hard
Its been so long.. since i actually laugh my ass out watching pewdiepie..
Happy wheel is the reason why I started watching you :D
no happy wheels its not going to die
Felix: Does anyone even remember this<br>Me: Flashes back to watching the slender man and happy wheels videos when I was 11-14/15. <br>Me, 21 y/o: Still here Felix!
Damn bruh this was nostalgic as fuck I really hope this re invigorates happy wheels cuz a new happy wheels series would be g maybe like once a month tho to not over do it also I&#39;m not crying on the inside I&#39;m crying on the outside
“its just not fun any more” <br>nah mate you are just getting old
Teme:dad YouTube remove over videos<br>Dad: I don&#39;t caaaaareeeee EEE you stupid child
Teme: but Dad I love you<br>Dad: I don&#39;t caaaaareeeee
you did a back flip and called it a front flip?!!
Of course I remember this!!!! Nostalgia!!!!
&quot;chairmode activate!&quot; me: *very ugly sobbing
This was one of the nicest nostalgia trips I’ve had in a while :)
The nine year old army was not born for this content. The bro army remembers.
Pewds pls do a collab with UberHaxorNova to end it like it started! With the two kings of happy wheels cmon guys let&#39;s make it happen!
Is it just me or did anyone else flipped out when Pewds remembered about Stephano? God I miss those times
Is when you start your chanell rate
I remeber when you play happy wheels
“Does anyone remember this??”<br><br>Me: laughs in Vespa
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPjJJxUTr4Y&amp;t=502">08:22</a> - The most nostalgic thing I&#39;ve seen this decade
