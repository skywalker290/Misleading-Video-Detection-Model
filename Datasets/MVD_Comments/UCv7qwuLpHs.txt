The lighting was so bad I didn&#39;t catch the secondary 5MP camera up in the notch. It&#39;s there! So you can in fact take even worse quality selfies if you so desire.
Notch without camera? Wtf
My phone started flickering suddenly and showed many dead pixels in less than 1 year. After sending it to Motorola they trying to convince me that there was a water damage while I never had it even close to water. Additionally the bottom of the phone has some poorly designed thin trim covering the stickers which came off after a few months. Not worth the money, replacing it with iPhone...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=235">3:55</a> innovation at its finest, a notch with a notch
I think that a deadly combination is an outward vertical folding phone
They did what they needed to for the first 2nd one  great phone still have it , just hope they worked out the bugs for razor 3 , this is a phenomenal phone , love it everyday !!
I got it new for 400 bucks and it is now my daily phone. I love it
❗&#39;Flip3&#39; is going to TRAMPLE👣 all over this....
So much complaining about the lighting, well I think it looks great, proof is your video, very futuristic active and brings out the phone. am I the only one that thinks so?.
Do not buy this phone as the screen peels off within 2 months of use, don’t waste your money, see the reviews as it is all over the internet about the screen issues, would suggest don’t buy as it completely crap. I have bought it and it has been replaced by Motorola twice but still the issues persist
yo i can watch this video in 1440p and 2160p?? i didn’t even know that was a thing
excellent overview. thank you!
I would buy only if there is headphone jack. So disappointed.
Great review!
Why did you say “impressins” it really threw me off sorry
too expensive
Why the hell is the captions in Japanese?????!!!!!
when you make a review stop saying i dont know.. i need more time.. be solid.. yea? Ill throw out 1500 easy if you think its a good phone.. just stop saying.. i dont know wait until I have one.... or.. stop doing promo vids.
damn marques, that was some really scrummy lighting on the phone, how come??
Hi there mr, May I kindly ask, whenever you open up your camera app, does it have a notification sound? As mine always do and I do and can not find anyway to switch it off.. as it’s annoying every time I open up my camera
No front facing camera?? I was almost impressed...
I need to sell my kidneys for one ahahah
Nice if it was £14.99 not £1499, so I will bye one when they move the dot before the 2 nine&#39;s
Davie504: my phone slaps like now!
It WOULD BE A MIRACLE.
Finally a phone made for dudes.  No dude wants to carry a brick in his pants.  I&#39;ve always said a woman must be designing phones because they keep getting bigger so it&#39;s easier for them to find them in their purse.  Finally one that I can fit comfortably in my pocket.  Now they do need to work on lowering that price.  The price point of $1,500 is just way to much for any phone.
This is pretty cool, but im waiting for the SideKick comeback!!!
I think that’s cool as hell old school wit new school
Motorola has always had a trash battery
Motorola is really hitting us with a nostalgia ad. I would buy this bc I had the original Razr when it first came out and it was my favorite phone.
Imagine apple logo on this ..for 1500 ? Revolutionary
Can you get Facebook and messenger what&#39;s app Fitbit and you tube apps
Its cheap for me
I want one but too expensive 😭😭😭😭😭
Yes The $1500 price tag is a little hard to swallow but if you had the original you get it.
wendy williams
Not a smartbuy for a smartphone
my dream phone. the final fantasy 7 edition 😍😍😍😍😍
I can&#39;t speak nerd
this is not 2002 lol
SAR level is better than others in the market. Health matters than applications
A phone set for failure from the get go.
Them thumbs though
I feel like this was a big downgrade from my Samsung Galaxy s9+.
This is too dope
cost
owen benjamin
only one rear camera
this dude put his toilet paper on the sink
I have that phone i buyed it 5 days ago man it is so awesome
Definitely is not the first foldable touch screen phone given that the iPhone 6 plus has been folding for years now
So I guess we can say goodbye to upselling phone cases?
People talk about the price of the iPhone but this cost more than every iPhone except the fully maxed out iPhone 11 Pro Max.
Who the fuck came up with the idea of not including an earphone jack? 😡
I did not owned one back in the day neither I know the pain bro 😂
Lavda mera kis baat ka chutiya kaata hai, 1500$ mere lavde ki jhaat nahi hai ye 1500$ ka, I bought super amoled, snap 720, 64mp rear 20mp front, 6000mah battery, and many more for 226$
It claps like ass.
I don&#39;t know.. i like this phone. It&#39;s to expensive. Price will come down once people figure out that its nothing special.
Specs = Mediocre<br>Durability = Not so much<br>Price = Way too much for the specs it has.<br><br>Paying strictly for being able to hang up on a puto with the close of a flap = Priceless!
It will be my S7 Upgrade😐😐😐
No front camera? So you would have to videocall with main screen closed?
Wow 1500, its like the G63 AMG of phones. Everybody wants one, but few can afford it.
I need a headphone jackkk
I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to sell too many of these.
Ever walk down an aisle at conventions and somebody just tries to grab and go with your camera? Hahaha.
I want a bigger battery
Thank you for your input and incredibly helpful video
there’s no camera on the inside?! that’s a huge flaw!
1500 and no real front camera. how tf is that gonna work for snapchat
Your phone fits in your pockets because you have man pockets! That wouldn&#39;t fit in a woman&#39;s pocket.
Aye could you also say its Razr thin?😂<br>*pun intended
I’m about to fold the company that made this.
Definitely would not purchase the first generation. It&#39;s a good start though. I am curious to see what future models will be like and what other phone companies will respond with.
If they make a version with an audio jack, improved battery life, and 12k pricetag, call me.😉<br><br><br><br>Or I could just wait until it becomes a possible upgrade to my Moto g6 3 years down the line. Whichever comes first.😅
&quot;No headphone jack&quot; thank you that is all I needed
the price has to be a complete joke!! Almost 1,500 dollars, ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!! Even apple doesn&#39;t go that expensive wtf. That&#39;s some mega bullshit man smh
These phone manufacturing companies obviously have money to waste because as innovative and different as this phone is, it&#39;s not going to be popular. The specifications aren&#39;t good enough to compete with the front runners.
I don&#39;t care, I want it. I&#39;m a huge fan of flip phones and the nostalgia of it.
Price in India : Rs 1.25 lac ....voooo very high priced
Yep, this phone is out of my budget...see more
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=238">3:58</a> it literally shows a front camera next to the earpiece speaker.... does that not work or something?? Why does he there’s no other selfie camera?
I loved Rarz but this is just ugly how they placed the camera in front:((
The motorola razr, everything I want in a phone, at a price a would only pay for a laptop.
Folding phone best 2020 expensive
I was really thinking to own one but later i changed my mind and stopped the video after knowing the price !!
Its about being stylishly different. Its  about being fabulously bold. Its about exquisite taste for something unique. Its about that special premium, regal and that sassy feeling when people around you turn their heads asking to themselves who&#39;s that fabulously stylish human rocking that marvelous fashion statement disguise more as a fashion accessory rather than a piece of  unimaginative technology..... when you just flip open the phone to answer a call.
Buy it if you can afford it. If not oh well stay with your bull ish phone. It’s that simple. I know I’m getting it.
Or just buy yourself an OG Moto razer save $1400 and the satisfaction slap after phone calls
The quickview on the front needs to be able to access contacts and texts. And the front facing camera needs stability, and also needs 2 speakers in the bottom and or change it to the front of the chin piece. Id love the fingerprint reader to be the home button too. Other than that i love mine!!
The custom phone case industries have expired
Insanity to sell and buy this new Razr for $1500.00.  I had the old razr.  Definitely not this.
Is this phone compatible with the Snapchat app?
Hello marques,<br>I m a Motorola fan<br>Need to know that-- Is motorola  announcing any new phone with its &quot;moto actions + voice commands&quot; in 2020.
TOTALL<br>Ripp off in uk <br>Will cost you AROUND £3k <br>£100 quid a month contract
Price
the original inspired by the communicators in star trek apparently
This looks like a good start.. Hopefully they have a better quality and cheaper version in the next 3-5 years.
Motorola: Razr @ 1500$<br><br>Call/Raise??? <br><br>Me: Fold!
Dude the lighting looked really cool what are you talking about. Id rather have this than the anemic hospital looking ones
wait 3 years. Flip Phones will be cheap as fck..
I had the original pink razr I loved it. It was the iPhone of the day. Everyone in my work wanted it when I took it out of my bag and put it on my desk. Ha ha oh happy days. It didn&#39;t last long as its flaw being so thin... Opening and closing it severed the wires in the phone. Shame. I like this new one. I think the second gen would be an improvement. Re battery etc.
🔥🔥🔥 <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=33">0:33</a> 💙 <br>  👇👇💝
They need to bring back the sidekick
I Loved my original razr by Motorola!  That being said, I will not be paying $1500 for a phone that I mostly text on.    I could, but I&#39;m just not.  It&#39;s not worth $1500.  When they realize it&#39;s over priced and the only draw to it is the fold, they&#39;ll level off to a practical price.    Big moto fan but not a stupid one.
Style with day to day usages
Best phone design. Waiting for price to comedown little bit buy one.
The original razor was a great phone
I wanted one because i really love motorola phones but when i heard the price for a sucky crappy phone 🅘 🅕🅛🅘🅟🅟🅔🅓
My grandma still has a working Moto classics it&#39;s almost 19 years old and still working.
The classics
This is better than Samsung Galaxy Flip Z.
It folds alright. It folds your bank account.
I bet they did it in low lighting so you couldnt see the flaws with it. I&#39;m predicting after 100 or so opening and closing that middle part of the screen will come unattached and start to bubble out. And when you told itll bend and crease out instead of in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=200">3:20</a> Dic k heads, that&#39;s because of the crease, to avoid crease screen moves down. YOu fail to understand that, it has much better crease solution compared to samsung.
Great video! In your personal opinion after reviewing both the Samsung z flip and this razor what would you consider the better of both phones? What would be the best buy, the best bang for your buck?
i hope this is the start of a resurgence, especially from brands like motorola and Nokia. bring back unique designs instead of rectangular slabs.
I’m 16, this seems like the future for me, not nostalgic at all. I think it’s funny how a lot of people my age look at throw back stuff and go “wow so futuristic” instead of “wow so old fashioned” guess that’s a testament to the ideas and design of the past.
It slaps
Sucks
I will buy it when it becomes affordable. Way to overpriced right now.
Dude, your palms are huge!
Must suck to know your main content source is so damn boring to most people nowadays. Cellphones aren&#39;t interesting anymore.
:54 seconds &quot;I&#39;ve never owned a razr&quot; yet it&#39;s bad design ?
i mean, it&#39;s expensive but the new iphones can go up to $2000 U.S. and nobody&#39;s complaining
That’s the same reason why I got the iPod touch 7
What vt ?!?! how do u make a video callss ??????
At $1500 pretty expensive...not a smart move.
I want it.
What an ugly pos phone, plastic screen has a gap between the frame and screen when you fold it . Crappy camera. Also for 1500 dollars no way moto it’s a piece of junk
I can&#39;t believe the phone Costs almost as much as when I paid 1600$ for my 1TB S10+. Pre order with the free Galaxy buds. Imo a10+ better as mkbhd said I wish and for that price.
It&#39;s all about the &quot;Cool&quot; factor.
How does it come a America wearing a Dutch national football shirt??
Wish it wasn’t made in india. would have bought two. made in india is worse than made in China. Already it was sad that iphone was made in China. <br>Can anyone confirm if any other country is manufacturing moto razr apart from india?
looks total shit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=233">3:53</a> at least I can appreciate this <i>notch,</i> because it doesn&#39;t get in the way of the screen real estate.
Isn’t there a front facing facing 5m pixel ?<br>The CNET video said there is.
Gotta love Marques reppin ultimate frisbee with the PoNY shirt 👌🏾
I think it looks awesome, great screen size too as it’s on par with most smart phones on the market
why did they make a round screen. i think the next Samsung fold is gonna be awesome.
I will just wait for dunkaroos to come out to buy my nostalgia.
The screen got damaged after a month!  Quality does not match the price 👎🤔
If youre willing to pay 1500 for a fucking phone, you have severe mental defects. That whole industry can go fuck itself.
Not nostalgia for me. Purely pragmatism. I need to have the damn thing folded and shut and not going crazy a la (Huawei pSmart, Honor) when I&#39;m not using it.
DO NOT PEEL THE SCREEN!
Still over here patiently waiting for the a 2020 version of the sidekick -_-
1499 ???? Hehehe <br>Wait until black Friday 2020 It will be 149.99
And there is one feature that everyone missed: it&#39;s also a money clipper
🤔 i want one
Absolute waste of money. If you need to spend this kind of dough on a phone you have way too much time on your hands, get a job...
expensive but i like it.
I look forward for the improvements of this device in the next 5 years.
Wait 5 months it will be under 500
They did the poor lighting so you could net see all the problems they need to fix
return to the roots
Who would pay that?
So..... A compact phone?
Ima razor fan. I may get it lmaoo
i love it, id buy.
When I think chin, I think Bolton.
$1499 in the USA but $2700AUD. I&#39;ll pass
I would never buy a phone that did not have a headphone jack.
I think I&#39;ll pass and wait for them to get all the bugs out first🤔 And come up with better tech🤨
I can&#39;t front I said hell no until last night seeing and playing on it I immediately paid my current phone off lol I should be getting this around feb 22 or so I can&#39;t wait.
Eh, nothing that hasn’t been done or tried, not worth it, maybe the old one back for nostalgia purposes and that’s it, not that great in my opinion.
Hi,bro,where i can buy it?
I&#39;ll wait till I can get it on Marketplace from somebody who&#39;s very disappointed
This is a cool but niche gimmick. It&#39;s not a practical smartphone for most people, that&#39;s for sure. But is it cool? That&#39;s for sure. It&#39;s interesting how phones are getting so much smaller though. Why do people not want to have a good time watching videos and browsing the web on their phones anymore? My LG V20 is so much bigger than many modern phones that it&#39;s frustrating and now that the Note doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack there&#39;s not much left for old school phablet lovers.
It was probably dimly lit because that&#39;s the conditions in which OLED screens really shine.  Pun intended.
He had to of been high in this vid. Red eyes... did no research on the phone.. missed a whole camera..
To note the pocket thing...I don&#39;t want the screen to be bigger because folding would make it ALSO bigger and many women&#39;s clothes have tiny pockets!
You need a wallet that cant fold close from the money to afford this
They have backed up again on delivery 2/18/20, I hope there&#39;s not an issue with this phone seems a little sketchy? Might look into Samsung flip, hopefully it wont come to that!! Peace
This is a flip phone! not that shitty samsung fold... jeez i want this Razr!!!
I don&#39;t to versions of the razor from years past and I always liked it. I also joined the Apple ecosystem back in 1983 with the Apple IIc. I currently have the iPhone XS Max and I&#39;m not all that crazy about it. In fact, I personally feel that it works poorly following the 13.x update. I feel that iOS is becoming somewhat dated With the square a little tiles. The RAZR appeals to me in a few ways and I have been looking for an excuse to switch to Android.
Nice job! Thanks for the details.
😍😍😍
It&#39;s a cool phone, but way too expensive!
Just ordered mine.
Who holds the phone to their ear, nowadays? Yuck!
I got a Coolpad.<br>$100 . Does everything y&#39;all phone do.
Can&#39;t wait to see the tear down from Zach!
Wait apple lg  HTC samsung copies...
IT SHLAPS
me personly, yes i want! cant waite! yes, you right, nostalgie!
You forgot to put it on the table and spin it  (Cause that&#39;s what we did with the RAZR &quot;back in the day&quot;).<br>Also, I wonder what happens when you drop it, because there&#39;s no way you&#39;re putting a case on it.
You get one of those Motorola razr phones <br>You&#39;ll be one of the first to use it <br>Everyone whips out their brick phones and you whip out and flip your phone open like a boss
Love it!
Rip Snapchat on this phone
Owned the original razr v3 from early 2005 to 2014. It was just that good. Only one battery swap. Had a Samsung tablet for everything else.
why wish to have a heasdphone jack we have bluetooth headphones
Hey, was there an issue with the lighting? He didn&#39;t mention it.
I was wondering about the need for a front facing camera for app use like snapchat, IG, fb, etc.
Believe after moto razr fold other OEMs will follow the same design in different dimensions,  hello moto you started the trend in 2004, what a design brilliance true innovation , still new in 2020
Hi <br>There bought moto razr v3 3 times , after that never liked another phone &quot;honestly&quot;, it&#39;s like MJ anytime anywhere its &quot;Charismatic&quot;, will be happy moto rebuild out of Lenovo and will be much happier if v3 return as feature phone, pls vote for the v3 razr by hello moto 🙂 like 2004 in 2020<br>Honorary Mentions: razr got launched in 3rd quarter of the year 2004, that means until 2003 it&#39;s a concept or did not even exist<br>Note: if relaunched now it should be non removable battery, bcz the retro of it was bit creaky at the battery compartment bcz its user replaceable
No protective case capability I&#39;m guessing. No protection
NO: Headphone jack/micro SD/Optical Image Stabilization (main camera 16mp/frontal camera 5mp) with 2510 mAh battery for 1.500$ ??? <br>That is NOT funny! ... :(
This device make me think if i really buy it i  feel like the screen going to crack or break when folding..i know it will not but it just feel weird to bend the glass just like that
Yup i couldnt afford the original one either...
U lost everyone with no aux jack, car rides are gunna suuuuuuuuuck
Looking forward to pre ordering it soon. I had the original in 2005, loved it.
I love this. Definitely want one just to be able to flip it closed!
That&#39;s an awesome looking phone, but I wouldn&#39;t pay that much or go to a different carrier just for a phone.
Leafy felt bad when he saw the design of RAZR.
Had me until the price. 1,499 =/<br>I wanted to live the nostalgic life without it being more expensive than the I phone or the Android.
Greetings from singapore, hello marques. Currently i am using samsung note 3 since 2014 and samsung a10 since july 10 last year. This phone looks awesome i mean for work purpose. Reminds me the very first motorola phone i use last time. Grey colour with antenna, only sms..lol. that was a few years back
I want 2 more folds. Scratch that. 3.
Thanks bro for telling the truth about this fone unlike those other paid views guys who were boot licking this fone
Better specs fone available than this crap with same price
Folding fones dont work with me always gets wrecked
Why spend $$$$ on new motorola foldable phone, just buy a phone with the screen that fits your needs and you dont need to do extra work by folding and unfolding the phone!
Best folding to date.  It completely folds flat, also.  No noticeable Bump on the extended screen.  Battery is too short of time.  Picture stability is important but otherwise, I am interested.
I am NOT giving Verizon my money.<br>Sorry, Motorola.<br>You made a bad deal.
People may thin it is crazy but you would think that when making phones back in like 2006 or 7 that they wo uo ld ha e been flip smart phones first then just what we use now. Idk just a thought weird.
Good info bro, regardless of their trash lighting lol
filming self with main camera and watch it while filming, no other phone can do that
Can it be charged on the new car chargers by just laying it down?
Way too large to be a razor
$1500 is insane.
1500$ is price of an iPhone 11 pro base 64gb in India.
&quot;No headphone jack&quot;<br><br>No sale.
Ill wait the for the Gen 2 when I can afford to sell a Kidney.
who would spend $1500 on a phone? Like I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s a used car.
Make subtitle indonesia
Impecável!
The second he said the price. nope...
The phone is PERFECT  .. period
You had me.... until 1400
Its gonna be sooooo satisfying to hang up on people
Anyone remember the Nokia n97 😂
Big gimmick, 2500mah battery? Get fucking real in 2019 that thing isn&#39;t gonna last a full day
Samsung making a Samsung galaxy flip phone active or something like this phone I thought they were in it was supposed to be releasing in 2020 with the one ui on it I’m not sure though
Your new icon is throwing me off. Thought this was some joe schmoe tech reviewer.
$1400... hecks naw. Lost me there! 😒
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=206">3:26</a> tbh, I noticed instantly
I hope its way less then the 2 grand Samsung is asking for their phone.<br><br>O $1500?    Well um no.
THiS iS SoO cOoL <br><br><br>You can have your normal phone and turn it into the size of a metos
I think<br>The release of it has delayed to increase battery size, put a nice screen and stuff and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=442">7:22</a> most things marq said
😍
I miss hearing &quot;hello moto&quot; from my phone back when I was in school... 😞
Motorola?<br>Tô fola!!
m gonna enjoy hanging up on ppl again
The screen will be protected if compared to other non foldable phones, that’s a plus
Paying 1500 for nostalgia and a phone that does nothing really unique for you is insane. With that kind of battery, someone who travels a lot would basically need two of those in times when 4000 mAh batteries come in 150$ phones. Sure, it looks cool but buying a cool phone usually refers to teens rather than 30+ year olds who actually know the old Razr. Sorry, but this is ridiculously overpriced for what it is and yet another ridiculous addition to the folding smartphones market, which fills a non-existent niche in the market.
Weak ugly expensive outdated
It doesn’t have a headphone jack? Well then...I’m outta here!
Marques you did well with what you had concerning the lighting and sound. Thank you for still presenting us the phone in the unique way that you always do.
I want that 😢😢😢😢
Way over priced.
I still have my original razor. I totally love this. Price aside, I would have liked to hear more about specs. Such as: 5G? eSIM? Possible dual sim? Is it actually shipping with android 9 still or 10? I&#39;ve been using dual sims and i&#39;m looking at the S10 5g and the new iPhone which neither seem to offer dual sim yet. That said... I LOVED the shell shape closing of the call with my old RAZR... and I love this one too. Battery... needs more for sure. And a headphone plug
1500? Bruh! That&#39;s a lot of weed.
The fact that you can fold thots phone provides 100× more protection than any otterbox for Samsung or apple.
just wonder which phone case can fit ?
Enjoyed your perspective. The Razr is out of my price range but in a couple years when the bugs are worked out and competitive brands release theirs, it will be time to get one.
My only concern would be if I could slap it shut like the originals, like if there’s a possibility the panel could mess up after a bit and stuff, cause I know I would love to slap it shut to hang up on my crazy ass gf
Flip phones never died in Asia only in the west. Good to see them back though!
This what the Google pixel 4 should&#39;ve been lol
This is gonna be motorola&#39;s comeback mark my words.
Motorola canceled it lol<br>There worried about demand<br>Is too high <br>Well in February Samsung will announce their foldable and will solve Motorolas problem
If you&#39;re bringing 2019 tech back to 2003, please bring the Oculus Quest, not that phone
That chin, be it necessary or what not, is the ugliest thing I&#39;ve seen. Ever.
Che merda P⭕️RC⭕️ DI⭕️
I think the size when folded is GAME CHANGING!  I don’t like the price though. <br><br>$1,000 tops.
1499. the original was 299 on launch. yikes
Of course this is an early adopter phone with a matching price tag but I really like the design hope they inspire others to implement folding in the same way, I really prefer this over an even larger screen
This is definitely the best version. Motorola definitely had a stroke of genius when coming up with this
$1500??? What the what.
I think its a bit over priced for the specs you get.....
2nd 3rd gen. Right direction
Folding phones are just not worth it...
If you go byack to 2003 don&#39;t forget to bring usb-c cables^^
when you mention the price I had to google this to be clear. 1499$ I can buy pc maxim spec for this prices
I am still waiting to hear of a good reason for a folding phone like this. Outside of drop protection when you still have a screen on the outside I see no good reason for it.
This phone is pretty dope! <br><br>Who all remembers the Moto Slvr though ? The L7 &amp; L9? <br><br>It would be cool to see a phone of that size with a full bezel less display in this age.
the fact you can hang up angrily again is worth it. rape their ears with a smack
Damm I&#39;m old,. This brings back memories.  I remember the first Motorola flip phone were it was so durable you could drop it 3 floors off a roof top and it didn&#39;t break.  And a buddy of mine knocked someone out with one in a bar brawl 🤣.  The razr took over and it was the shiz back then.
1500 !!<br>Damn
In India it&#39;s price is like 7 million
My gutfeeling says no...and now i want my old razor back...!
Yeah, a bigger wider screen would have been ideal. I will be switching from Samsung but am concerned about my Samsung notes not transferring.
Is it possible that only broke and poor watch and comment it?? I will buy a few when I find a place to buy it...
whats the phone marques currently uses?
I&#39;m getting one for Christmas!
Wish it had a headphone jack? What the hell Marques, it&#39;s 2020!
It slaps 😂
I am gonna buy it when the price down to $600
You really have the best intro music
That should be the razr slogan <br><b>&quot;IT SLAPS&quot;</b>
Well the galaxy fold is expensive, but at least it has high end hardware. This one is a mid range phone..
Someone out there in the world is still using the original Razr and is watching this like, finally I can upgrade my phone.
I’ll buy it when it comes to 300$
Can’t wait to have sex with the razr
if this could only come with iOS installed on it...
Sorry to disappoint but there are people that are younger than you that feel that nostalgia of flipping a phone shut. lol. who else is younger than Marques and gets that too?
It&#39;s not a hybrid phone - tablet, there will not be many people  have interested in it. Period.
Foldable phones are gimmick. Like 5 camera phones. It&#39;s unnecessary and expensive and loses its novelty after a week
What&#39;s the actually name of the intro music? Found the artist, cnt find the song.
I wonder why the scrolling version of a flexible phone didn&#39;t take off.
After marquess told the specs i was kinda expecting it to be more budget but 1.500€?! For midrange specs thats insane, No Matter how it folds
I think I&#39;m about to put a whole paycheck into a phone
best of the old skool
if they made it a tad bit smaller, it could work as a watch on your wrist, that could flip out to be a phone that you could disconnect from your watch using magnets... theoretically
All my friends had the original razr . I couldn&#39;t afford it . This one is pretty cool.
That is  star trek phone Hands down
Thank you for your first impression about it, I think it’s a nice move from Motorola as a start to get in the smartphones competition, at the end they knew that a lot of people still looking for a folding phone easy to put in pocket, by that they targeted a huge people or buyers of it in addition to that it’s not bad at all, I mean of it’s characteristics, I think it’s a 6 of ram, Android 8 or 9, 128g internal storage and 16 megapixel of the camera
1500 bucks is a lot or nostalgia !
I’more into iPhones but I’d like to buy this beauty.... $1499? Hmmm... maybe not... :)
The form is worth exploring!
GOOD PHONE
No front facing camera, still has an ugly ass notch.
This is the phone to get to be the cool kid!
No headphone jack and not waterproof then what&#39;s the point of not including a jack?
Motorola Razr V3 was my favourite (not only me but the whole family).<br>THE FUNNY PART WAS THAT MY FATHER SOLD ALL THE PHONES HE BOUGHT IN THE PAST TO BUY THIS.
Are ye to faltoo Technic he
It’s funny despite all the cons I still really want one.
The only reason I’d buy a folding phone is to have a tablet within a phone, so this phone breaks the whole purpose of it.

This interesting to see African review - I don’t know they sell these phones ... South Africa? <br><br>Motorola is good company &amp; before they are big. I don’t see now so many.
Motorola, if you&#39;re listening, RAXR Max please! 🙏🏾
I hate that YouTube unsubscribes me everyday from this channel...

Lenovo/Motorola<br>For real freedom is ultimately only Android/Linux. <br>Not iOS. Only dumb people are using iPhone.<br>Fashion and perfume Industry people, showbiz people are majority of dumb people on earth.<br>They don&#39;t even understand a bit of technology that&#39;s why they&#39;re so into dumb stuff; apple. The rotten eaten apple.<br><br>Huawei, Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo/Vivo/Realme are spying. And you can delete the spying by modifying your phone ;)<br>So what the heck is Apple doing?! LOL (controlling your smartphone from distance, even worse than spying). I always hate iPhone even the latest 11 pro max is nothing in my opinion. Best camera? Get a real camera will you.<br>Asian products are much better in many aspects.
Really this is one of the worst phone ive ever seen
Thats just too much money for a phone.
This folding technology is obsolete ...<br>Nobody folds his phone today. What&#39;s the point?
I miss folding phones like this one. They were the best! Im glad they coming back
I would absolutely want this phone if it weren’t $1,500! I just can’t justify spending that much on a phone.
my question is how am i supposed to put a huge otterbox case on it so i dont completely destroy it
1500$ NOSTALGIA. NOPE.
What kind of name is this mkphd or mhpkd wth
Pointless trash. It’s only real feature is nostalgia.
Samsung fold kinda kills this even with a higher price point. Included wireless earbuds and almost twice the screen size, battery and ram.... but it is a razr and I remember mine from back then! I love how the phone companies are going back to originality.  Plus for consumers
They might have made the lighting bad so if there were any creases in the screen, it would be unnoticeable on camera
I want Nokia 5300 back :&#39;(
(•_•) <br>&lt;) )╯ <br>  / \
I&#39;ve been a Samsung fanboy for a few years now, but as soon as Motorola razr rumours started i said I&#39;m buying it if it ever comes out . And yeah i still feel the same ,I&#39;m definitely buying it.<br>If it would have a headphone Jack it would be perfect  😍😍<br><br>Edited<br>If the rumours about the e sim are true and that the European version will also have an eSIM , than I&#39;m really disappointed, so no i won&#39;t buy it!! 🤔🙄☹
So how do we get on a video call...?
If I had the money, I would buy it without a second thought.<br>It is just so cool.
I honestly want this phone lmao can iPhone please buy this and have message id so buy it!!!!
Pablo Escobar brother came out with the foldable phone for about 350! Escobar fold 1?
To expensive and probably wont be durable since that&#39;s not glass on the inside screen
Imagine having a laptop with this mechanism, with displays on both sides (touch screen keyboard). And when you open it flat 180°, boom !!! <br>A FULL screen 30 inch flat screen display like TV 😃😃<br>This hinge mechanism without crease can be revolutionary.
Look so smart
1500$ really high, i can buy 3 Xbox2 for that amount!!! Sorry razor maybe next time around!!
Bro how I get this phone here in doha Qatar 🇶🇦
Not worth it, sux.
I got the fold and am getting this
Please show us Escobar Fold 1 review
Still got the original in hot pink and still works used to love it
I want itttt
Oooooooo
Used to love Motorola had the RAZR slvr and milestone. But the camera seems to be a fail.... How do I video chat on such a small folded screen?  Completely ignored the needs of the wechat user market.
I’m not impressed by any foldable phone.  This is especially a too small to be a folding phone.
Why does it seem like we&#39;re downgrading ourselves again? Smaller battery, garbage camera, fat chin, and bezel for days. But wait there&#39;s more.. a bigger price tag than an iPhone 11.
It doesn&#39;t seem that bad.<br><br><br><br><br>But the price is WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
Thanks for the video bud... folding full screen phone is awesome enough in my head
This is so gooodddd! I never own the old razr previously, but there were this thing going back in the day where my friends and I would trade phones for months on end until we feel like using our phone again and I get to use her razr for a couple of months and I love how they are able to modernize it!!!
Phone is going to fail. There’s no purpose for it’s nostalgic gimmick.
When he said the price I closed the video... Just came back to tell y&#39;all
If you watch YouTube on your phone this phones not for you
Motorola might have hit it out of the park with this one... my S10+ smart phone is already looking clunky and outdated!!! Only down side is the price!!!
When you want a razr for christmas but it comes out after this christmas and your not on Verizon
1500$ in Rupees... 1,07,631.    😓😓😓😨
Moto invested hardware with razr..
Not worth it. iPhone 11Pro/Max cheaper &amp; nearly waterproof to top.
1500 bucks?? Dayum mane
I WILL BUY 1 FOR ME.I REALLY LOVE IT.
Welcome to 2004 again LOL 😂
nope
&quot;no Headphone Jack&quot;<br>Motorola just lost a buyer.
This is the best folding phone design in my opinion.
finally phone will fit again in the pocket
$1500 what!!!! I still have my old one from the 90. I will try to get it turned back on lol....
I miss the old razor.. I would totally still use it lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=436">7:16</a> “I WISH I was a little bit taller, I WISH I was a baller..”
I never got a razr back in the early 2000s, and that is the main draw to wanting one in 2019.  I will wait for a gen 2 though cause I&#39;m still not sold on the reliability of a folding 1 piece screen.
&quot;Its going to cost 1499.&quot; bruh y&#39;know what? Ima just keep my iphone 3GS lmao
I do remember the Motorola razor flip phone, I use to own the V3 model back in high school, back then you were the cool kid for owning one, it was like having the iPhone or the latest Samsung today, I am looking forward to this new moto razor, I want one too!
I want this mobail..<br>.
Absolutely OUT of the question. This phone is not even close to being worth the asking price, by any stretch of the imagination. It&#39;s cool and when I heard it had one camera instead of two, and that the specs were below flagship level I had high hopes for a decent price. Slash a grand off that price and we can talk.
Cars and cellphones are two products that are overpriced, especially when these companies sell millions of them. From 200-300 dollars we&#39;re in the 1500$ now? They can keep it.
If the durability is solid, I’m ditching my iPhone.
Now i know Why RAZR doesnt have the &quot;O&quot; cuz once you buy it, you might get brOke.
What kind of t-shirt is that? Looks exactly like the old KNVB logo (Dutch lion)
Mark Ass Brown Lee.
Why’re you complaining so much the lighting is fine the video is fine
YouTube subtitles are in Japanese  and the auto translate to English of your perfectly clear English narration is killing me &quot;voodoo sho main shofie voodoo smoke.  dingus are you doing&quot;.   Just a heads up
We went from Flip phones to Touch screen smartphones and now back to Flip phones but this time with a touchscreen
i never had a v3 and now i still cant have this?
Not even gonna lie, I would actually still rock the original razor if I could buy a new one.
As an old razr user, i want one! But 1500usd?! No thanks!!!👎
They don’t make em like me no more.
If I had this phone it would never get lost
This is fine design aesthetically but the biggest flaw or weakness is the small form factor usefulness. Once you fold it the small screen should enable a lot of functions you don&#39;t need when it&#39;s fully open such as quick replies, small window browsing. This is useful when you are carrying things or when your hands are full. I&#39;ve always wanted a small phone....again. :)
You say this phone slaps, but does it SLAPP!?!?!?!
It has a front camera for calls, right?
I&#39;ll buy one when they <b>Fold</b> the price in Half.
1500 dollars fuck off lol
You had me, until the price.  I could live with the lesser specs to get the form factor... but $1500 bucks.  No way.
This is an innovative retro step to have both a large screen in a small form. I’ve owned razor phones and I hope the price of this will become more affordable.  I wonder if this device will be available to use for first responders on First Net?
hey the 2000s called they say they want back everything awesome!!!!!!!!
I wanted one until I heard the price...
Does it have bluetooth?
Waiting on the Krzr so I can stunt on people like it’s 2005.
I think the concept is spot on. Bigger screens are for tablets.  Jmho.
Outdated tech, tiny battery, insane price, no SIM card slot, no headphone jack, no ip rating, slow charge... this is a budget Cricket phone at a top tier price. $500 or gtfo.
how is snapchat gonna work without a selfie camera
They should have a discount for anyone that has the OG razr.
Seems like a very awesome Mother&#39;s Day present: I know my mom loved the original Razr, and she&#39;s already hinted she&#39;d love to upgrade to the new one :-)<br><br><br>Edit: Definitely see some potential issues though: 2500 mAh battery for a phone with that much power (and such a long display) seems like a recipe for disaster. I don&#39;t see how the phone could make it through a typical work day and still have battery life left.
Hell no Moto, Mr Roboto<br><b>slaps nuts</b>
Cell phone is so wide and big on this day.
Have to admit, I want one. I loved my flip phone from back-in-the-day. I dont need all these fancy gadgets that these smartphones have. I think it looks really cool.
How badly lit was the room?
The question is will I be able to play cod mobile on it
Folding the screen probably feels so bad😬
Will this have an SD card slot ? <br><br>And will it have a headphone jack? If not, could I use a headphone jack adapter?
I think i want to buy me this phone
I think at the price they are charging it should include all the top specs you mentioned. It is no doubt the coolest form factor and they will most likely cash on that alone but I will wait until the specs are where I want them before I spend that kind of money on a phone.
Wanted it bad until you said 1500
I just got the eleven and now I want this
If Motorola was smart they’d sell the original again but with updated software and fixes to any little complaints people might have for say $99 bucks like the old one. It would sold so damn well
A phone that fits in women&#39;s pockets!
1500 is way 2 much for a phone. But. I said that when I had a premium phone at 300,400, 750 900
The best thing about a flip phone was being able to slam it shut after a heated conversation.
I owned the original razr, well, many of them, and bc of nostalgia and memories of that satisfying snap I would love one of these.
It would be cool if it had a headphone jack...if they update this version with one then I may actually want one
Still have my old Krazr 🤣
Man I’m just waiting for iPhold. 🤪🤪🥳
Loved the Razr back in the day and I welcome a throwback to smaller size. But...$1.5K? Nope.
Cool idea, but because of some questionable specs and high price , people might wait for a 2.0 version.
Just give it a higher quality camera,a screen that looks like it won&#39;t crack as easy as iphones  and make it cheaper then they have a masterpiece right here.
1500 DOLLARS!?
The only razor I can afford is made by Gillette
$1500 and no headphone jack?
That new one can’t handle my attitude filled snap closes filled with years of built up anger
Valley girls and angry men, ya got your snap back.
Is not waterproof like all of recent released phones! Was the only focus the screen? Sorry but ill pass.  dropped my current phone in the toilet and its still purring like a kitten
The ad song claps tho
As always, you did an excellent review of the product and provided some thoughtful insight for those of us considering this to ponder.  I had a the original razor phone and loved it.  Flip phones were great, they were compact and worked very well.  Some phones would have a kink or break in the ribbon cable at some point between the two halves of the phone and then it was pretty much useless, my Sanyo rugged phone was just that example.  After that I had to upgrade to a smart phone which did not and still does not work as well as a phone for voice communications.  Also to note for those less familiar with flip phones, with an actual keypad I could dial a phone number by memory without ever having to look at the phone because once I found the center button (5) I could do anything at that point.  Much safer when making a call and more reliable than voice dialing.  Just a point to mention in the evolution of cell phones where we lose something for more technology power/convenience.
Can we get an actual razr again? Give me an updated version of the ACTUAL phone. I miss texting with one hand t9 and not having to look at the screen.
High price tag and subpar camera setup with dated CPU equals no way!
everything was going soo good, until the price was revealed
I love the look of that phone and the razor come back is cool
I like the idea of it. My gripes would be to make it a bit wider and not $1500 dollars. $1500 would be something like the Samsung fold, not just a folding phone.
I like to see an 10 inch folding razor with 6000 ma battery.
In all honesty. This is like a 600$ phone. Max
I kinda like it .
How do you use Snapchat doe
How about face time or video cam
Im already want
They need to fold that price in half!
So how would that camera work with Snapchat in the folded mode?
seems to be another guinea pig product that costs way too much than it&#39;s actually worth. you&#39;re just paying to be apart of the experiment of folding screens and motorola nostalgia. not even sure if it would be worth the price if the price tag was half that.
This is awesome!! I was just playing around with my old RAZR. The only thing is the price tag. I&#39;ll buy one of these maybe 2 years from now when it&#39;s alot cheaper.
I folded my wallet when I heard the price
Looks Perfect.<br>Then finds out there&#39;s no headphone jack. Aight Imma Head Out.
<b>Ok Boomer has joined the chat</b>
It&#39;s 1,500$, in short 600-1000 fuck no&#39;s too many
I want this phone too, but I wanna wait til a better version comes out.
Way over priced
They can fold that phone with the $1500 price and shove it
Girls gonna love it. It fits in purses or even bra...
I like this design.
UFO Tech
Mark ass brown lee lol
I want one for nostalgia! I used to have the original and it was probably my favorite past phone as far as feel and satisfaction! Again I want one!
Rip Snapchat
$1400!?!?! Good lord, I can buy an amazing gaming PC setup for that! I hope they come out with a cheaper version.
i&#39;m looking at the screen that looks like it pops up a bit on the edges. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=199">3:19</a> can stuff get under that, and maybe damage the screen as it flatens?
Ok so iphones are expensive as af and Motorola mAkes something better and ppl hating? I prefer motorola period!
Nothing personal.  I&#39;m just trying to see if YouTube will fix its shit and stop recommending I watch all the videos I repeatedly tell it&#39;s stupid ass that I don&#39;t want to fucking see anymore.  Because &quot;Not interested&quot; means not interested.  <br><br>Profanity partly from actual frustration with this &quot;feature&quot; and partly to see if the site gets the hint.
id buy this phone right away for 300 dollars
Fuck why has to be that expensive? You loose customers not gain
“It Slaps”
Just waiting for Ed Zander to come through riding a bicycle....
all i can think of is retards slamming their phone closed like 2004 but shattering the whole fuckin screen
I worry if that when you close it will the top of the phone scratch the bottom display
I miss my RAZR, but won&#39;t be getting that one with that price tag.  There&#39;s not a phone on this planet I&#39;d pay that much for.
Snapchat has got to be the most annoying thing in the world with this phone😂😂
This beat ain&#39;t on your playlist on spotify bro 😂, what&#39;s the name of it?
i’d buy if it wasn’t so expensive
I had the old one. And this is very nice
They could have put a sideways headphone Jack on the chin. Wasted potential.
Wish Apple made such iPhones (maybe someone already has said this)<br><br>Just can’t use anything other than iPhone
$1500 nahh not worth it.
Tujhya Aaichi Gaand
I hope with the flex view display, they fixed the issues the shatter shield displays had...
Razr is known for their flip phones so they wanted to create a more modern version of their iconic phone design. Sadly though the price tag on this is a force.
This is really cool but one complain what if you close it so hard you do know that people will break the screen
Holy finger prints
Waiting china smartphone copy it, and make it cheaper, hehehehe
No headphone jack<br>Outside me : Ok<br>Inside me : f k off then
I won&#39;t buy it until the folding screen is really practical
How old ru to have the original Motorola Razer ??
I cant wait for companies to start bringing back the headphone jack as well~
Fuck that phone!
All we need now is for SIDEKICK to make a comeback as a smartphone. One can only hope.
Love this...thank you for the video. I think this is for the ladies. It can fit in the smallest bag :)
I’d be interested in purchasing the phone for pure nostalgic reasons being I owned the original Razor. This would be a phone for fun just to say I have it.
Girl pocket friendly, finally!!
My name is Sean and I was about 24 or so when the first RAZR  phone was released. I recall being very excited. about it&#39;s size and design most of all.  Back then Moto was the top of the Go To devices. The morning after i purchased the phone from ATT,  I had a meeting that I was running late for.  It was pouring outside and I left my brand new phone in a taxi as I tried to juggle my umbrella and computer bag.  I was so upset.  Sad to say I never got my phone back.  I am so excited to see this phone make a come back in its updated form and  will get one for sure.  Your video was awesome as always!  We need to connect and network.
You’re buying a gimmick not a phone
Novelty buy
Looks good but will it be style over substance
i was watching this and got an ad for the razr lol
Is the phone out
The small screen is how you&#39;ll make video calls
Ok boomer
How much?! For that piece of shit?!
excellent reviews
scrappy video - but still gets 6.6 million views and 17k comments in less than two weeks is impressive to say the least.
WoW what’s with pricing... geez...
Im going to wait a couple of years so Motorola can get out all of the bumps and kinks. Besides for $1,400, I saw a Yamaha 850 for sale I would really rather have for that same price.🙄
Yeah yeah hate me, but can I have this with iOS please?
❤️
I need one.  I used the microtac elite in the early 90s, which was the last analogue handset prior to gsm.  It was so tough it would bounce off concrete.  I also had the razr, such a beautiful design when phone design was interesting and could determine its success.
No thank you
what is special about this phone other than it folds? it reminds me about when firts 4k tv released,its so expensive..after  a year or more years,it sell cheap in the market..its folds?? its a gimmick..
$1500?!?!?!?
No headphone jack huh?
I like that its compact . All these bulky phones sticking out of peoples back pockets look pathetic. Moto is going the right route but seems that apple and samsung  are still on top. Moto needs to work on the marketting team. Cause they suck!!!!
4.7k dislike are Apple&#39;s Fans lol
Does it just close when you just fold it or do you have to press a button for it to close?
My initial impresins
Lmao how would snapchat work on that lil display?
Fifteen fucking hundred. Haha screw that. Great review as always.
Only with e sim am i right.?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=400">6:40</a> ok boomer
They bought back the razor I wonder will they bring back the sidekick 🤔
When you get the review unit could you please show us how snapchat works on there?
i stopped the video at 1,499$. hard to believe that we live in a time where a phone can cost as much as a car. or at least a down payment on one. wtf.
shut up useless what do you know
Android has to change the UI is getting boring
Dude I remember watching your early videos before you rocketed up so high.<br>You did a very brilliant job dude in keeping urself up and your channel up as well.<br><br>I do not know you but I&#39;m proud of you!<br>Keep going and review everything! :)
You look like a thinner Shorty low!!
And for more, we&#39;re the generation who prefers text than call. This phone is a flop. Sorry.
love that it can fit in pockets. but 1500 bucks for a phone with mediocore camera, not even ultra hd? hell nah.
$1500 for a phone without a selfie camera? We can&#39;t even make a video call with it 😅
It slaps<br>Davie504 wants to know your location.
Seems like im going to disagree with my wife more just to get the pleasure of &quot;the slap&quot;.
That&#39;s a shit phone for the price.
Apple and samsung : we have the best flagship phones <br>Motorola: <b>CLACCKK</b> BITCH hold my razr
买不起😭
Marques since you are into tech. how about try the worlds first blockchain gsm cell phone. Best new form of mobile communication
Leica or Zeiss? Where are a difference? Nokia is the best with Camera!!!
phone manufacturer: the screen in 7 inches sir.<br><br><br>marques: make it bigger.
About time! Always wondered why Motorola or other companies never thought of a full touchscreen folding phone like the original Razr. I would rather have this than obsolete iPhone or Samsung design. So much practical and cooler!
No, I still like the old RAZR.
1499 ???<br>Seriously?<br><br>I understand that this is an iconic phone, I also loved the original, but that price tag is just ridiculous...<br>... actually made me give up on that phone.<br><br>Just ridiculous.

$1400+tax LMAO!
i don&#39;t think that this is the best version of the  folding phone. yes, as mentioned by you, bigger display, bigger battery and a fast charger would have given the phone a better quality. Though, not planning to purchase this phone after it&#39;s launch. And yes, the price is high. Please hit the thumbs up if you agree with me...
Do we really need folding phones in future, it&#39;s totally waste of time and money
Apple will come out with one in 6 years and they&#39;ll call it innovation.
can I buy one half of the phone for $750
I will never use Android platform or google!!!
Drug dealers getting an upgrade
Oof 2510mAh
Girls : &quot;what phone do you have?&quot;<br>Me : &quot;hmm a flip phone&quot;
Cant wait to see the Oderbox for this thing....lol. I actually would rather the screen fold the other way and have a big square or dual. But realistically my phone needs to be very durable to last the 2 year contract and a folding phone isn&#39;t a big deal for me.
Phone Cover Case Company : I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve done this!
I want one 😂🤣<br><br><br>Wait wait wait $1500 😐
The ad is really amazing
I actually thought the lighting was really nice in the hotel room at least
Tempered glass and back case: Am i a joke to u
Nice review. The old phone slapped close also. <br><br>Agree on the durability. I think we&#39;re not quite there. 5 more years
My next phone is going to be a foldable phone but not this tiny.
Very interesting design, actually looks really good. But like the other 1st gen folding phones, the limitations and price point seem like a bit of a turn off
nastalgic , yes i like it , but not with this price tag
so, we call it flip phone? or fold phone?
I wonder if people are going to be idiots like they did with the Galaxy Fold and peel off the screen. Then promptly bitch that the company made a subpar phone.
$1,499.00? with that kind of money it better come with bluet ooh ear bugs plus all the accessories
Wow this looks amazing. Can’t wait till Apple steals this idea
God that phone is so cool
Too bad it uses android
With those specs they smoking all kinda of crack asking 1500 🧐
So flip phones coming back
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=233">3:53</a> &quot;No camera up here&quot;, while showing the camera
why are you black
Ok so I’m watching a Motorola razr video but yet I get a Motorola razr ad what?<br><br><br><br>Sudoki_Sara.exe has stopped working
Not worth it for all of this hole price 🙄
Honestly I HATE how phones fit in my pockets and I LOVE flip phones. I don&#39;t care about giant screens either, so this sounds absolutely perfect for me!
I remember when I had the pink razr so long ago lol I loved it!😊
I want one too, not on Verizon and not for $1500. Wait and it&#39;ll be much cheaper in 3 months.
&quot;No headphone jack...&quot;<br>Ight, Imma head out
Sorry to say no matter how good this phone can be people always run backed iPhones it&#39;s just how it is these days
I will buy as my secondary phone for calling and show off
Maybe girl likes! to me is a cheap makeup box.😁
apple flip phone ???
The Revenge of The Flip Phone.
I like it. It is compact. I hope it is affordable.
@marque so you can not listen to your music if you have headphones. Aww this is a huge disappointment,because I was so waiting for the folding phone to come out
I don&#39;t know which is more impressive, the phone or the comments in this video, lol
Different is better and Motorola is the best
This phone is Legend
$1500 LMFAO
Ok but what about gaming and the chin? Does it get in the way of your thumb placement for like say shooters?
Lenovo Razr
Nothing more annoying when YouTubers say &quot;let me know in the comments&quot;; They don&#39;t reply or probably even read them
It has oxygen OS🧐?
shitty reviews as usual. Thanks Marques
Great, they did what i thought they could do!<br> But its all a bit too little with that much money.
Mal schauen wer sich das über 1‘500€ Smartphone holt 😂😂😂 Preis/Leistung ist völlig überzogen und nicht empfehlenswert.
It competes.... with a Galaxy S5
Have to wait and see the further version of razor
No this thing is stupid with that 21:9 aspect ratio that means the screen is squished together and text becomes small and for people with bad eye sight it&#39;s a pain in the ass to see but with the Galaxy fold it gets bigger and larger so you can see it more and again it&#39;s 6.2 inches but it&#39;s so damn skinny that people still look like little specs of nothing on the screen with it being so streched  out
Is Motorola willing to fold the price?
I still have my old pink razr phone 💖 I’ll just add service! Meanwhile I’ll wait until the new pink razr phone is out for $700 bucks? Thnx!
I was waiting to hear if the battery is  swappable.   That is the only thing holding me from looking at new phones.   My Galaxy Note  4 is still in service.
The whole video is you bitching about the lighting man come on
How much is it gonna be?
ill be using this in my new testa truck
1500 dollars!! what the actual fuck? I was expecting 1000 or less
&quot;Ive never actually owned it but all my friends did.&quot;<br><br>I felt that.
Kinda cool. But not $1,500 cool!
Kirk to Enterprise. I want one. Because that&#39;s one thing that inspired flip phones.
$1500 are you kidding me. If I wanna hear a slap for that amount of money I’d rather just slap my own ass.
For 1500 bucks you should definitely be getting 12 GB of RAM snapdragon 855+ and at least a bare minimum 6.4 inch display because the Samsung galaxy a20 has a 6.4 inch display and it’s 120 bucks come on Motorola needs to step up its game compared to the oneplus 7t pro McLaren edition this phone is quite pathetic and to me honestly it seems like a feature phone rather than an actual smart phone that will give you good performance.
Mi : Hold my 🍻
Holy mess the price!
I actually genuinely want the razr. I just like motorola&#39;s android skin especially with their take on an always on display. Along with the shake to turn on the flashlight is one of my most used features. The phone is almost a no brainer to me.
Snapchat would be a dead ting
It is avail in India.
Admittedly don&#39;t have the budget for this (and I am sceptical of the durability) but I am still sick of Verizon having all of these exclusive Motorolas AT&amp;T needs to step up their game lol
Ooph that camera would not be great for Snapchat users.
The battery will be the deal breaker for me sorry no Dice!
<b>I folded my wallet when i knew the price of the phone</b>
Ahh, exactly to form-factor I want, but:<br>No microSD and no headphone jack is a deal breaker for me.<br>sigh<br>As long as the components are good quality and work well the specs are fine, especially if that helps battery life... I really don&#39;t want all the silly extras that come with smart phones these days, and I certainly don&#39;t need a dedicated selfish camera. The &#39;lack&#39; of pointless fripperies also means a more elegant device and should help to keep the price down...<br>$1500.00..? You must be kidding!<br>Oh, well I can wait... assuming Motorola come out with a far cheaper update that includes a headphone jack an microSD slot - for me a phone is genuinely worthless without these.
Shit battery
Man was looking forward to getting this phone but $1500? Im good ill wait till it comes down in price. Lol
That&#39;s a no for me.. not impressed.
Fed not worth 1500
Nice phone I remember when I had a razor back in 2006 and yes this is a throwback for me. It would be a lot sweeter if it was just a tad wider. Compared to the Samsung folding phone I would prefer this Motorola as I don&#39;t need all that screen, the phone screens now are pretty large as they are. I look at them as on the go and at home that&#39;s where I prefer to use the larger screens as on my laptop or tablet. If I was to buy the razor I will wait for the price to come down.
Motorola RAZR hinge; the foldable mechanism Samsung Galaxy Fold should have had in the first place
&quot;it has a hinge. Pretty complex one...&quot;<br><br>Dude, it&#39;s a folding phone which supposed to have hinge. 🙄
Umm no
Still waiting for the SIDEKICK to come back 🙏🏽🙏🏽
I loved my Moto Razr!!!
I&#39;m sorry but in my eyes vertical phones are literally useless the only point I see is to make it more compact when you&#39;re not using it. Folding the other way is actually useful because you have a bigger screen
Who else saw the motorola razr on supernatural?
£1499?!?! Fuck it, I&#39;m not buying a new flagship for the rest of my life
I plan on getting one of these next year for around a hundred bucks... Have a g6+ now I only paid 45$. Good phone.
中国什么时候能买到？
Who else got the razr ad before watching this razr video?
I remember getting my black razor until it was out of style and I could afford it and I think if u bought one u would get like 3 other free razors I’ll just wait till the same happens with this one 👍🏽
Totally worth less phone specifications like135 doller phone 😠😠😠😠
Imagine slapping your phone closed and boom <b>CrAcKeD</b>
1500... I&#39;ll just leave my phone unfold..
I love the idea of rebooting the mototola razr, it is definitely different compare to other smart phone where all of them are chocolate bar shape. But upon hearing the price, NOPE😔😔😔
But how well lit was the test area?
This is what tech is supposed to look like honestly
So, let&#39;s see what you get in $1500 phone<br>No headphone jack<br>16MP single camera(No OIS)<br>2500Mah Battery<br>1080p oled foldable display<br>SD 710<br><br><br>I don&#39;t know who the hell put that price<br><br>And yeah no one buying it untill they have money to spend.
Vai corintia!🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
You don&#39;t need light to hear that a phone &quot;slaps&quot; 😂😂
Love how it looks, but <b>I got concerns about the screen, especially after several months of use.</b>
Black Mirror phone
Its cool. But I would&#39;ve liked a bigger screen, battery and a better camera, especially at that price.
Which wireless charger do you prefer that works for AirPods 2 as well as for an iPhone ?
Padu beb
Lemme guess flip phones are funna have like 3 cameras next
India launching date?<br>And prize??
It&#39;s definitely gonna increase my productivity. I can attend a call and snap it shut. No insta, Facebook,whatsapp to waste time on.

I folded my wallet when I heard the price
<b>This phone is designed for womens jean pockets 😂</b>
i hated that phone when it came out, the O/S was awful and i don&#39;t understand why it was so popular. I&#39;m not going to get it now! lol
I hope apple does a flip phone. Android is just so garbage
How to make bad investments<br><br>Step one: Buy a $1500 phone.<br><br>Step two: Repeat step one every year.
history is the new future ....what a irony !
The last american cellphone product!
Sorry but 1500$ is a huge mistake by Motorolla! They could make this thing 499$ and could gain momentum again after all those years, but this is dead on arrival! I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is the final nail in the coffin for Motorolla!
Never buy the first gen of any product
Thats to expensive. No. I find it interesting but my S9 can do more. Thank you.
it looks like trash watch in like 2025 or so, phone companys are going to bring back the brick phone
Why nobody talks about big issue and that’s video calling... no selfie camra when it’s open....
soo....1500$ only for the flex screen? and all the rest is like xiaomi note 5, bullshit
Sd slot ??
I feel now this can actually take over i phones....extraa amazing....😎😎
fuck that price!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=439">7:19</a> no headphone jack. Wtf.
&quot;Opposite of a well-lit room&quot; he is trying so hard not to insult Motorola in any way at all.
Does it have a hole to put a lanyard in?
This Motorola Flip phone is so stylish and super cool!
Hahahahaha 1500.00 !?!!?!? No thanks
Excited to see subsequent iterations. This is an exciting nascent concept.
I hope motorola razr 2019 use iOS13, not android... Hmmm 😪😴
What is the prospect for accessories? Cases and screen protection?
For the first time i got disappointed by your review. <br>Tbh you ask for too much in a phone.. <br>Moto has come up with a masterpiece which can destroy the market provided that they reduce the price of it. <br>It&#39;s smart , it folds , it&#39;s moto , it can play call of duty (so gaming is topnotch) , usb c charging which even iphone didn&#39;t give. I will buy it , people will buy it, people buy crappy iphones and they&#39;ll still buy this too.
Fuck this
Great idea, but terrible price.
I still have an OG Razr in a drawer somewhere. Maybe I can get a trade in credit. 🤪
$1500...<br><br><b>puts phone down and leaves room</b>
A BIG FOREHEAD WITHOUT CAMERA
I really like the smaller front screen. Kind of reminds me of my old mp3 player
It’s the nostalgia gimmick phone. Cool af but gimmick.
Snapdragon 710🤣🤣🤣
so u can&#39;t use snapchat...?
I’m no fan of foldables (as of yet), but at least with galaxy fold, you get top range specs for the price. <br><br>Yeah it’s $2000, but with this costing $1500, I would take the Fold all day.
$1500..... You&#39;d have to be a daft monumental bag of hammers to think that&#39;s a good price.
👌
Motorola can make a bigger RAZR which I think would be a great way to attract more people as a bigger display always attracts crowds plus for it being a good, solid folding phone as well
Can you like smack it closed or should you be careful?
Seems to be nice! But I have one concern opening and closing the Razr one might think that will start to wear and show a Kris in the screen?
Bring back the Nokia 5110
How to anwser texts?
Motorola made a new category phone: SMART BURNER
I loved the Moto razr v3i I have used it for so long and this new razr it&#39;s perfect the way it is unless it doesn&#39;t burn a hole in your pocket
why you always keep digging problems JERK
At $1.5k, seems like they&#39;re just selling nostalgia.<br>I was too young to have a phone when this phone was out, but i remember wanting one because i thought it looked so cool. (i think i was finishing elementary school/starting middle school)
You know, you gotta admit.     That ad was sick
Wow love it!
I&#39;ve been searching for a compact phone after iphone stopped releasing 4 inchers. Finall someone is making something that can actually fit in my pocket. 21st century sucks!
Opening that thing up for every text is going to get old...
Umm, it’s not the same size as the original razor. The razor was not as wide.
I can see Nokia resurrect their old flip flops of the early 2000s and adopt the foldable screen onto them for nostalgia.  Foldable screens are still in the experimental stage. The late release Galaxy fold shows new improvement of the screen factor. There&#39;s room for improvement I think the foldable screen factor has some future. It needs to be more sturdy.
I remember snapping these phones in half back in the day after a bad break up 🤣🤣🤣.
How good is this spec wise compared to an iphone?
The worst phone I have ever seen.
U lose the game of pubg when ur closing a flip
This phone looks perfect for women&#39;s pockets!! I love it. But it&#39;s so expensive 😭
$1500 for a gimmick. Sweeeet..
I have an idea for a new version of the SIDEKICK, same housing same swivel screen but the keyboard inside should be a touch screens 2 screens. <br>we need different phones and with the RAZR coming back we should bring the sidekick back
Razr was one of the first phones I had back in the day. I miss the old style and would love to get this phone but um 1499 yeah i&#39;ll wait a few years to see how long it lasts cause something tells me this new folding technology doesn&#39;t have a long life span
Would it be better if it didn&#39;t have the MetroPCS cameras?
this phone should be no more than $300, at this price it will sell very well, but 1500 is crazy to pay for it.
A notch w/o a camera, really ?!
I don&#39;t want this, I need this! 😍
The phone is cool, would like to buy it but will not pay $1500 for this nor a $1000 for an iPhone. We should all do the same as purchasing these phone will keep encouraging the companies to increase their prices. Remember, high end phones were $649, now it&#39;s a $1000 and above. High end pricing became the lower to mid end phone pricing. We have the fault.
I actually still have my old razr....I’ll just use that.
Hey wat is up MKBHD, in my view this is the best utilization of a folding screen and for sure I&#39;m  gonna get one.
Can’t wait to see at which level it starts taking scratches and deeper groves.
The return of an icon. You couldn&#39;t be popular in HS unless you had this phone, or at least people knew you had the means to obtain it if desired. I guess you could say i was a &quot;jock&quot; in HS (which i regret now because the nerds of yesterday are making that check now, while my star running back used to be ass is homeless and struggling with drug addiction) Young brothas let me just tell you. That cat isn&#39;t worth it, APPLY yourself and focus on your schoolwork. The women arent going anywhere.
Really  really lame....Don&#39;t know how anyone can be fascinated by a flip phone, an obsolete concept.
Used to own the original, it was around $300. Nice phone. But I won&#39;t be paying $1500 USD to relive the experience.
This is the proper use of a folding screen.
I want one that runs iOS
im 18, and I used to freaking love my flip phone &lt;3
15000 for this thing??? its a foldable ok. and its cool... but its specs are shit and it looks ugly. maybe in 5 years if price sinks to 400-500 then maybe...
its hurt that there&#39;s no headphones jack, headphones with usb will be included?
using main cam as selfy cam is very cool...
Mar: As you can see..<br>Me: I can&#39;t due to the bad lighting
&quot;Motorola, why did you do it like this please&quot;<br>You sounds like a fucking judges or something.. Peoples like it that&#39;s all, no need to be shitty talking, no wonder until now I&#39;m still not subscribed to your channel
Maybe its hinge will be the great folding sample for other producers to develop and update their folding display tech
Holy shit I wanted it... then I heard the price.
<b>So we going back in time eh?</b>
Nope
They smoking crack... $1,499!!!!!!!
Who used to have a motorola razr back in 2003
gereksiz q
I don&#39;t like big phone&#39;s I still have an experia compact I want a folding screen for this reason to make a tiny phone grow to a good size not a good size phone to grow to the size of a tablet, the price is a big put off I&#39;d probably pay between £500-£650 and that would be a push
I was into phone even though not having a Quad HD or Full HD Screen and not having the snapdragon 855+, because i had the original razer and i loved it, it was a great flip phone back then, where they lost me, is asking $1500 with those specs, i would pay $700-$800 tops, but $1500 is an insane asking price for what those mid range specs, the only thing that makes that mid range phone worth $800 is the folding screen, because if that phone did not fold with those specs it would be $400. $1500 are you kidding me...GEEZ
Fold done rightl
Ahhh.. i hate you iphone.. i want this.
Does it hv bluetooth ??
Man, that rear camera will make awesome selfies!
1500 is steep when nostalgia is the best feature
The Emo phone is back.
But was the lighting bad?
Why pay a lot of money?  How about battery technology? They don&#39;t focus on battery charge capacity. Cool and nice doesn&#39;t give me long lasting bluetooth or wifi battery entertainment.
Just like the iPhone 11Pro vs original iPhone video , I&#39;d like to watch HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) vs Google Pixel 4 video ! 🤩
I did not believe this when I first saw an ad for it. I thought it was an actual joke poking fun at folding phones.<br><br><br>Boy was I wrong. Such cool tech.
This is really how u gotta do a foldable smartphone, not like samsung did it
How one can able to play...pubg game in this flip flop phone....
Way too much money no thanks
I see this as a major fail?
Bruh a phone that fits in my pockets finally
Mad.. send on the krazr
no audio jack ... that&#39;s a no for me chief
I wouldn&#39;t buy that one 😅<br>Normal phone still better choice
8848
how can we do video calls bro?
It would he a record selling phone, for $499.99, not $1,499.99.
Reminds me of the phone from the movie Her
It&#39;s looking great man
Apple: First time pricing your phone this high?
hello motto
I swear I thought you were white until I saw you lol
For  1500 bucks, that&#39;s not worth buying. The specs are pretty low end for the price. Well, it might be a folding phone from the brand who originally invented a folding phone back in 2004 but still, it doesn&#39;t complement the price. In 2004 it was really amazing and I could say that that&#39;s normal for a new kind of technology but we have seen them. The recreation from the past doesn&#39;t give justice to its price just because it was magnificent back then. Practically, I will still choose Realme X2 Pro than this. Folding phone today is just for fancy, Not yet for full usability and functionality.
now try to pill off the screen from the side
Completely unrelated to the video but I was curious about this phone and saw your video. I recognized your name as a fellow ultimate player and was delighted to watch you and PONY compete in nationals in San Diego the other week!
Motorola battery life sucks
It&#39;s over razr...the flip thing (to me) is done.
I wish motorola make a 2020 version of rocker phone.
It is phone in &quot;Her&quot; movie ???
What?!!?
i am just feeling bad for temperd glass company owners
Mmm
loved this but loved the diy hotel room setup even more tbh
T-Mobile needs to bring back a Sidekick type device yes they had the 4G but I’d like to see a newer one in 2020
great now there’s 4 razer phones
Fold-Curious, as i d like to feel the phone in my hand, plus the folding hang up has to be just as satisfying as it was years ago.<br>Also the higher end razors had removable shells, which allowed you to buy different colors and texture like metal or plastic.<br>The price is outrageous but if it fits in my hand nicely and battery would last two days with no or very little YouTube or internet use, I would totally buy it.<br>Also, for $1500 I would like a chrome and or stainless steel shell or bezel. <br>Brushed nickel or even satin but stainless would be ideal, so hopefully in months to come that would become an option.<br>I never had a razor years ago, now I can try and make up for what I missed in my childhood.
why would i buy a phone to shut off a call dramatically when no one even calls me?
This company is probably being the dumbest one in all of 2019 to create a phone like this and waste their time..
camera.... just 1 camera?? lol:: galaxy win~
How do you put screen protector on it. ?🤭
Its good finally we can comment on razr lol
I learned something from this video: you can zoom to make YouTube videos screen filling =o XD
I love it . Let&#39;s hope they set the right price .
Nobody:<br>Motorola: here is the new razr phone!
I actually like it tho, the fold seems pretty hidden, or maybe even very flat, when seen from the side compared to, say, Samsung&#39;s. Super nostalgic too! Way pricey, but maybe in a few years I&#39;d consider owning something like this :p
Markass brownley
This is 100% the first best foldable phone. Nothing was a foldable phone to me, just junk, until I saw this.
So no actual selfie camera, no input for earphones etc, but still give it such a price, lol
I remember how everyone broke those phones as nobody used cases with them.
who says you can&#39;t use a red camera to vlog?  for this Razr...  I can&#39;t see how the Razr can cost $1500 when it doesn&#39;t really offer any true usability advantage over current phones. <br><br>The screen isn&#39;t any bigger than what we have with the current phones. Heck, my Galaxy S10+ has a bigger screen. The screen quality isn&#39;t up to my S10+. It doesn&#39;t have a top-of-the-line SoC. It&#39;s not thinner than the latest smartphones. It won&#39;t have the usability of other folding phones (while open, it&#39;s behaves like my S10+). the battery is only 2500 mAh. <br><br>Flipping it open will be novel for maybe the first 100 times you do it. After that, it&#39;s just a regular phone that you have to flip open. Motorola is depending on nostalgia and the media is slurping that up. I loved my Razr back in the day because it offered a lot of advantages over competitors and was very stylish. But I don&#39;t see that with this one.
Yeet
This guy sounds so much like kurtis conner ??
Halo moto
This is definitely a beta model. I will wait until they cut the price, add colors and better the specs. Honestly, knowing Apple, they might steal it next year so I guess I’ll just wait until then. Don’t know if I’d want to go back to Android..
Wait, $1500 for a snapdragon 710? Hell nah.
I tried so many Motorola phones and every single one died perfectly around the upgrade time. Done with them unless they don&#39;t screw the purchaser. Samsung has proven me right in my choice of them
how much is the cost
Naaah for that price they can keep that Razr I&#39;m good
Awesome
1500$ for a midrange phone . I would rather have a 2000$ with the best specs ...
so we had a blackberry 2018 a razr in 2020 does it have t9 and will i have a sidekick too
Marques: <b>shows a 2023 kid the razor phone</b><br><br>Kid: lol your pictures aren’t even in <b>VR</b>  ?? 😂😂
This thing, given the exchange rate for New Zealand will cost around $2,350. Even with a fold-screen this piece isn&#39;t advanced enough (for me) to warrant that absurd price.
I just want to know how they’re going to make screen protectors for this one
Yup.. this is it chief this the one... This IS the future of smartphones
Finally a foldable phone that makes sense.
I wish it wasn&#39;t $1500.<br>Congrats on over 6 million views so quickly.
Screen size is ok. I have an issue with the battery size and price. I have no interest in this phone.
Seriously tho, if they did a modded og razr with a better camera and WhatsApp for a fraction of the cost of this, I would buy it. Don’t even need a big screen.
Trust Motorola to flip it like a boss.
Had me until the price. It’s new stuff tho so I don’t mind waiting till the price drops. I loved my OG razr because it was small and simple to use. I’m not a power user, social media, WhatsApp, calls and YouTube. I’m still on an iPhone SE and it does the job so I’m not the type to need the newest.
If I ever moved away from iPhones, this would be it. I wanted original Razr but went for something Samsung made
Best phone  ever, everyone  complain for price  lol<br>iPhone  = Ford<br>Samsung =Audi<br>Motorola raz = Maserati 😀
$1499.....Ite ima head out
$1500 😳!
The RAZR design is a step to the right direction. Smaller form factor with big screen is the thing of the future. We would most probably see rolling displays by the end of 2020.
That is a go
The original was dope as fuck this one is cool but it doesn&#39;t have that same &quot;wow&quot; factor like it did when we were smashing it shut during phone calls for no reason lol
Welcome back, Moto
1500 bucks... for a gimmick phone... i mean hey, if you got the money...
How Mach
I have to wait to the 2 or 3 generation after all the defect people found😎
Honestly i like this mobile:... my advise to moto make it the most strong in terms  of build quality software and specs ... it will sell like candy
Okay so this is totally stealing the RAZR thunder but does ANYONE want a sidekick revival. I never owned one but I have used them and I think it would definitely be a hit.
<b>(BUYS MOTO RAZR PLAYS COD MOBILE ON IT THEN WITHIN 6 HOURS SNAPS THE PHONE IN HALF)</b>
The biggest Bull Shit of Smartphones is Apple!!! Very bad System, that’s why is Motorola good really.
The new Motorola is the cheap Plastic!!!
Leica Camera is the best, and only Nokia has a Leica Camera, not Apple!!!
1500 is air...sold
Motorola is better than Samsung and a big Shit-Apple, but Nokia with Leica Camera is the best Smartphone the World. Old Nokia’s are with Leica,s Camera, very old Models of Nokia!!!
Nobody:<br>MKBHD: I&#39;ve been using this phone for the last 6 months..
Motorola? I don’t like Motorola!!! Nokia is much better really!!!
$1500...okay...make it $2000 while at it !!!
Wow this is ugly
Only way I&#39;d buy it,  is if it sells A unlocked version. Verizon  SUCKS. So does the phone bill per month... Straight talk for the win...
15 hundred dollars!!! hell nooo!!
OMG the nostalgia is killing me!!!!!!!!!!!!! back in the days folding the phone after a call was the best thing!!!! as a 35 years old dude, i&#39;ll buy one for sure
Imagine using Snapchat on this phone 😬😂
My next phone.
It&#39;s very skinny so it isn&#39;t good for videos.<br>And $1,500 is way over priced.
The future has to start somewhere. Don&#39;t look at the price, the future will have folding (rolling) screens everywhere, tv, news papers, wall frames, windows etc, just like in movies. Everyone  wants big screens, but also portable.
Disappointing specs
The OG RAZR was so satisfying to open and close. I can&#39;t wait til this tech matures, and that early adopters price isn&#39;t a thing. Or at the very least it&#39;s speced properly for the price point.
Am I the only one who wants a slide out qwerty smartphone ?
Grandparents with a flip phone: I will never upgrade to a smart phone unless it’s a flip phone. <br><br>Razr: Bet.
Me: finally a Motorola phone that’s descent, smart, and worth my money <br><br>My wallet: am I a joke to you?
1500??? iight imma head out
If they did the same for $300, I would get one even if it had 2 separate screens with a small bezel-divider.
so the lighting was bad?
Whoever thought of this needs to be slapped
Found this page on ig ...thealpha_tech ,if you lost your mobile phone just text them ,they gonna track it  for you asap.
But you can&#39;t watch native 1080P tho
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=84">1:24</a> I legitimately thought he brought a budget phone to compare to the Razr and then I realized it&#39;s the Pixel 4.
Jeez no need to explain why you want the phone. You want it simply because it&#39;s cool 😎
Technology is going so fast it’s going backwards 🤯🤯
I RAZERD my thoughts after listening to the Price
Id be slamming it shut so hard the screen breaks 😄😂
&#39;&#39;Mommy? Did you just fold your iPhone?&#39;&#39;
Who else got the ad?
Soon all smartphones will look like this.
&quot;It already fits in my pocket so I dont know if the folding feature is worth it&quot;<br>Bro, you ain&#39;t got girl pockets 😔
1499? o_O I wouldn&#39;t pay more than 699 for a phone
Samsung fold took an L there
I love this idea of a folding smartphone. I still stand with my opinion that smartphones don’t need to fold. But if they gotta fold, please do it this way.
Yeah, I&#39;m not interested. Just as you, I wasn&#39;t someone who had the original, and honestly wasn&#39;t interested then. I was a big fan of my T-mobile Sidekick at that time.
So fucking insane I want it!!!!
Flipping open your phone to answer calls will always be cooler than tapping or swiping. Its just too fucking expensive.
Nice,looks like it belongs in a women&#39;s purse.$1500 to be like an earlier model iphone user looking for somewhere to plug in with that battery.Noop.
I&#39;m a little bias since, I&#39;ve developed a hatred of Big Smartphones.<br>The largest screen size I usually will tolerate is 5.8 inch, any larger and my pocket/hand starts to feel really cramped.<br>So even though the new Moto razr has a 6.2 inch screen when unfolded, when it&#39;s folded it&#39;s only 3-4 inches and that will fit in my pocket/hand spectacularly.<br>Also I&#39;m very impressed this phone has a lot of very interesting features, moreover I like the amount of storage and RAM of this phone, the battery is no big deal at all, since I&#39;m not a power user.<br>final judgment, in my opinion if it weren&#39;t for the price I would say this phone would be the sexiest phone of the year.
This is just dope

I have always been a samsung user and have the s10+ but wouldn&#39;t buy their fold because I am not interested enough in one BUT this is something that I would be interested in purchasing for my mother
I think I speak on behalf of most women when I say that yes, a phone that has the potential to fit in my trousers&#39; pocket is my preferred implementation of a folding phone 😂😭
I loved my original Razr!! But now have been an Apple guy for years. Curious to see how well the screen holds up over time with continuous folding
Hows the battery life? Should I wait for the second version?
I’ve always lovet motorolla and i think for me this is the best folding phone 😍😍
Just take my money !!!
isnt this guy like 20 years old? of course he couldnt have owned the previous razr
I had to use a &quot;hand me down&quot; pink one when i was young, i didnt care for shit. I loved that phone.
Motorola back at the day...<br><br><br><br><br>Motorola also today
Ohh a folding phone wow for 1500 damn it is so useful 🤩🤩🤩 <br><br>Fuck off i can but AI robot or something for that price.. It folds everywhere
My 6 year old picked up my phone and tried to bend my phone in half.. Why your phone rubbish dad 🙈
&quot;It slaps&quot; - Marques Brownlee<br>In the Bay, that&#39;s dope!
Battery and price is ridiculuous
If Moto could deliver android updates on time i&#39;d be in. As a former Moto Z, and Z2 owner i&#39;m not gonna buy another Moto phone unless they can sort their updates out.
$1500 for mid tier specs?!? kiss my arse Motorola
FULL CIRCLE
&quot;I couldn&#39;t quite capture it in this, opposite of a well lit room...&quot; Lol!
Looks cool. The video is important. Needs better stabilisation than iPhone. Also needs wide angle lense. Cool design for high quality selfies. I hope they make an alternative version with these features. I really like the folding concept. We need large sensors, low aperture for awesome lowlight (better than iPhone).
That notch I didn&#39;t notice. It seems to just work with the phone design. Probably to do with the actual screen design.
I think this might be the best implementation of a folding phone. mayne its nostalgia but I like it.
I’ll buy the next improved version, especially if it comes in the iconic RAZR magenta color
I still have my original Raz
Since i got this Phone i m having fun playing Pool (OG´s remember this Game from the Original Motorola Phone) and Taking Good Photos &lt;3 <br>Razr V4 is my third Favorite Phone after Huawei Mate X Fold and Nubia Red Magic 3s &lt;3
I had the razr color purple. <br>$1400  umm no thank you
Don&#39;t make any decision to purchase any &quot;folding&quot; touch screen phones before Jerryrigeverything does his review.. he&#39;s gonna put those poor phones under a tank and see how it goes for durability test..
Expensive but really cool. Just think about how fast notches went away then got fairly cheap. Folding phones will take over by 2023.
But.. It&#39;s too costly now a days compition merket....<br>Moto again will be fail 2020....
I fold my wallet after watching price of this device
I used to have the razor but this one is not worth 1400 bucks. It’s really not, would be nice to have though...
It is most definitely not the same size as the original
Will wait until new flip touch phones with cheap price come into the market.
Yes.. Yes.. And Yes.. I want that &quot;snap sound&quot; when I&#39;m done with a phone call! I need it!
I want one!
THE HYPE IS REALLLLL!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I want to know how middle of screen will look after a month of use.
Hey Marques! What Microphone Do You Use?<br>Which Microphone Do You Prefer? Which Micrphone Holder Hand Is Best For Fortnite Live Streaming On Twitch
+<br>jerryrigeverything has got you covered on that durability test.
Android or Moto  system?
imagine paying 1,500$ for a flip phone
I can&#39;t wait to slap my phone closed on my bf
Hooray. The new razr is out. Time to buy a used V3

Realme x2 pro plz
WOMEN&#39;S TINY POCKETS ARE HERE FOR THIS.
Shut up! Take my money!
Great for all them wamen with their almost non existent pockets
How many kidneys do we have to sell for this phone? 😂😂😂
So what about trying to put a case on it ?? How would that work ??
What’s the purpose if it doesn’t make a larger screen like the galaxy? Rather have a normal touch screen for half the price
this will be popular with girls.. they got tiny pockets in their jeans
Just like when other cell phones show their retail price of well over a $1,000, just because the Rzr  is a unique new thing that was once a cool old thing, there are tons of people who are going to buy it. Especially people who don&#39;t care about money, because you can Finance cell phones these days and just make a payment just like other people who make payments on things they have no business owning. This device will be no different. So all of you who are complaining about the price, just remember there are things you currently &quot;own&quot; (actually the Bank owns) that you should not own because you&#39;re just making payments on it.  And you will wish you had one when you see one in person. Because I have, and it is awesome.
I remember being really jealous of a family member who had the motorolla pink flip phone back when i was in elementary school. We really ade living in the future
Now if your ex calls you back you will answer with a big smile on your face
Would prefer a phone to fold out into an iPad Mini rather than a phone to fold down to a tiny midget display.
Nice dutch footbal shirt
Talking about the camera, I think it will hard for Video Call
why should a mobile in 6&quot; size have to be FOLD
جهاز جيد لكن العتاد قديم والسعر غالي
My excitement level to receive this as a gift... 98%, my excitement to receive the new iphone 11 as a gift... 59%
Love the size and design but think the price is way too high for what it is. Im a Motorola user cause always thought was balanced between price quality and not  posh. But this phone Will get face to face with the other posh phones and if its not for the hype and marketing dont think people will choose it as much against flagships
the hinge mechanism is the real legacy of this smartphone

The absolute funniest part of this video is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCv7qwuLpHs&amp;t=379">06:19</a><br>I replayed it several times.
$1500 for a phone!! Come on now!! I’ll be sticking with my relatively cheap iPhone 11!!
Dude no white back round please to bright
I even owned an original moto razr so many were sold it was a great phone
So selfies can only be taken on that smaller screen. 😬
Looks dope.
Just hated
Weak specs, not even full HD, horrid battery... This thing is hilarious. I don&#39;t care if it folds, super overpriced
You&#39;re shooting raw right? Can you not correct the discoloring from the lighting?
Mark are brown lee
Iphone : Most Premium<br>Samsung : Great display<br>Pixel : Great camera<br><br>RAZR : <b>SLAPS</b>
ugliest phone
i miss flip phones, i will they had the software of iphone to make it super easy to switch
Still got the old one !!
what t-shirt are you wearing mkbhd?? the phone looks cool!
99% people don&#39;t even bother to think about the quality of the video, as long as the infos and the audio are good 🙂
Just wait for Huawei or Xiaomi to make a foldable phone like this but with better specs and sell it for just $500
Motorola RAZR: Hello World<br>RAZR blade from Jerryrigeverithing: Hello
How about game performances maybe try some of those too
If you could stop complaining about the lighting after the first time, that would be great.
Price is the most important...
The price please
The gimmick ain&#39;t worth the price
ужас !
Talk about an ugly fucking phone, folding is cool and all but I really hate the way it looks
Why so expensive there not even a apple logo?
Looks like it belongs in 1832
Looks like it belongs in 2009
I dont think its the same size.
Nice try but Motorola is about 15 years late to the game
Smartphones are like sneakers nowadays. An iconic model can bank on it’s previous glory.
Motorola: “2020 Flip phone “<br><br>Apple: “ Haha “
