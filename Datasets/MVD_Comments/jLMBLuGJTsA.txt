Since Madame Web is worse.<br><br><br>Maybe Morbius wasn’t that bad after all.
this trailer held such promise....
Why half of the scenes are missing in the movie??
What music is this
I remember watching this trailer when it came out and actually being excited for this film
It’s insane that they released this over 2 years before the movie came out
It’s morbing time
Why is everyone laughing at this movie? I really liked it and I&#39;m not kidding. <br>The movie was good . And the trailers for this movie are great. Overall 8/10
The movie that made Alfred Hitchcock weep and declare superhero movies to be true cinema.
What the hell? And the 1 million likes?

Not still afraid of the dark are you
One of the best trailers ever from MARVEL but the movie sucked to be honest...
When I first saw this trailer I was really excited for the movie. Morbius is one of my three favourite vampires of all time. (The other two are Alucard from Hellsing Ultimate and NOS4A2 from Buzz Lightyear of Star Command for those who wanted to know) Like most of the other Spiderman villains, i was introduced to him through the 90’s animated series. I thought he was really cool and but underrated to be featured in a movie. My jaw was on the floor when I found out he was getting his own movie and it was in the same universe as Tom Hardy’s Venom. But when I saw the film I was disappointed with what we got. I really wanted to like this movie. An R-rated Morbius the vampire movie would’ve been dope had it been done differently. But now all I see are people making “It’s Morbin Time” memes everywhere I look and it pisses me off. I hate the fact that this film ha to be postponed due to COVID and it was given a pointless post credit scene trying to tie him into the MCU. I feel like Sony hasn’t learned anything from their past mistakes with the Amazing Spiderman films. And with the upcoming Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter movies, we were so close to getting a Lethal Protectors spinoff with Venom, Morbius, and Kraven. But now that I saw the trailers the hype is just gone. I like the idea of giving Spider-Man villains their own spin offs. They’re just as memorable and lovable as the hero himself. But it’s not gonna happen and I can’t help but feel frustrated. I could picture how it would’ve worked in my head… maybe in an alternate universe we actually got a good Morbius movie and my alternate self is getting excited for the possibility of a Lethal Protector spin off movie which could’ve led to them all appearing in an Amazing Spiderman 3 movie 😢
10/10 would watch again

❤beaty is all around us, look forward to  seeing you <br>Delovly
It is hard to believe that people were once actually hyped for this movie, unironically.
Best movie of all time!
This trailer was 100 times better then the whole movie 😂😂😂
This was such a great movie. I especially love the scene morbius where tells Peter that &quot;With morb power comes morb responsibility&quot;

Es tiempo de morbosear
If this movie was rated R, it would have had a chance. Movies like this and Venom need to be rated R. Like Deadpool and Logan
If I had a coin for everytime that I realise that there is something that is Spider-Man related with Beethoven music in it&#39;s trailer, I would have two coins.<br><br>Kinda weird that it happened that exact number of times
Have ses have ses
Best movie ever
its morbin&#39; time
I actually loved the movie. Haters gonna hate. But I like that
This is a trailer for a better movie
It’s Morbin’ time
The only thing they actually did was trick his fanbase into thinking it was an R rated horror with a spider man character but nevertheless
watching this trailer back after the film is actually so upsetting. genuinely wanted this to do well, and well...

Wow! I feel very good that i existed when it releases
Why can&#39;t Disney buy Spider-Man and retcon all these movies
How to take a second-rate comics character and turn it into a pathetic also-ran.
Looking back at this, I still think it&#39;s a genuinely made movie.
La mejor película de Morbius
It&#39;s morbin time
Something fishy?? 👌🌝😐
When we thought that this movie was absolutely going to be the best of all time it certainly was
this would be better if Jared Leto wasnt a sexual predator in real life.
Morbius is love, morbius is life, morbius is a religion, morbius is god. Morbius is a multiversal god, and he rules every universe, <br>Wait........you don&#39;t like morbius? YOU SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR YOUR DISGUSTING ACTIONS, YOU SHALL BE TORTURED IN THE DEEPEST PIT OF HELL!<br>Morbius created you, morbius created us, and i will not stand you shitting on morbius because <br>&quot; iTs A bAD mOvIE&quot;. Morbius is the best movie. No one likes sonic. Sonic is shit, morbius is everywhere, everyone, anyhow, anyway, and any day
I commented on the official trailer and now i&#39;m gonna comment on the teaser trailer. This is the BEST THING EVER. Nothings better than morbius. I love morbius, ever since i saw morbius&#39;s face i smiled and screamed. I love this movie, sonic 2 is shit, but morbius is a masterpiece. When i once see morbius i will morb everywhere. I can&#39;t describe how much i owe to morbius, it is a masterpiece and i truely believe morbius changed my life ❤. I will repeat what the channel elvis the alien said &quot;morbius is love, morbius is life.&quot; I love morbius.❤
This movie should&#39;ve been rated R. But marvel is being a bunch of pussies.
Is it just me or does Sony like to purposely make their movies suck?
Is a Morb or be Morbed world.
Definitely a movie id rate from 1-10 !
Thank you youtube for the recommendation of this master piece movie of all time after three years.<br>God bless you.
Where Morbius gonna reappear next? I really think that machete is a reference to Kraven the Hunter&#39;s weapon.
Even in this SMSMCU&#39;s Morbius film, referencing the &quot;Mayday&quot; word to another Marvel&#39;s Spider-man character, Mayday Parker (Mary Jane Watson &amp; Peter Parker&#39;s daughter) 🤯🤯🤘🤘🤘🤟🤟🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏💯💯💯💯🎉🎉🎉

Morbtastic acting
I thought it was pretty good.
This looked good, WTF man
The movie
We can sue Sony for lying in the trailers now
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> There was Tobey&#39;s Spiderman in the trailer, but I thought I&#39;d see Tobey Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man in the movie, but it wasn&#39;t. @sonypictures
What about milo?
I was only nine years old. I loved Michael Morbius so much, I had all the merchandise and movies. I&#39;d pray to Michael Morbius every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I&#39;ve been given. &quot;Morb is love&quot;, I would say, &quot;Morb is life&quot;. My dad hears me and calls me a FaggMorb. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Michael Morbius. I called him a MorbCuntunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I&#39;m crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it&#39;s really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It&#39;s Michael Morbius. I&#39;m so happy. &quot;It&#39;s morbin&#39; time&quot; he whispered as he procedeed to morb me up. My dad walks in. Michael Morbius looks him straight in the eye, and says, &quot;It&#39;s all morb now&quot;. Michael Morbius morbs away through my window. Morb is love. Morb is life.﻿
Please let this be as good as I want it to be.
Actually a good trailer. Bamboozled I guess

Morbius truly deserves to have been called “Batman” if there was not already some rich dude with toys calling himself Batman.
Deleting the scenes,bad VFX, Covid 19 and the post credit scene that makes no sense destroyed the movie.😔😔

Good movie
First thing I notice is how useless cutting your palm after seeing every bats simply ignored the actor.<br><br>Then flash back showing the kid fixing a monitor machine using a pen spring without trial and error. <br><br>It&#39;s like he have done that a hundred times for all the Milo&#39;s. <br><br>The professor finally noticed his gift and give him an proper education. <br><br>And finally, the crippled young Milo able to run down the stairs to retrieve his letter faster than the bully finish reading it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=132">2:12</a> Is that the Timelord? The Doctor?
One of the worst movie comics of all time. Perhaps if it came out on time, in 2020, without reshoots, it would be much better
When I watched this trailer, I thought that Morbius had born in 1951 and that the rare blood dicease made him immortal, that made him to survive to this day, but his condition would`ve been worse, which leads him to try more harder to find the cure, but becomes worse: a living vampire.
wouldnt he have gotten rabies

I remember morbing to this when I saw vulture make an appearance.
All jokes aside the movie was ok there where some scenes where there was cool moments and if a sequel gets made people would pay decent money to here him say “It’s Morbin Time”
2 years ago I thought this would be a scary dark DC like movie but it was like Morbin time
Would give it 2½ if I could. Definitely doesn&#39;t deserve the 3. This movie was meh. The beginning showed loads of promise the latter part let me down. The fight scenes were decent.
Waiting for the sequels ❤️❤️❤️
Greatest movie of all time 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Its funny how people got excited to this movie before it came out<br>Saying its gonna be better than any mcu films combined<br><br>Its a good thing this movie exceeds to the hype
Oscar winning movie
To be honest, This is probably the best movie trailer i have ever seen
this trailer is best...compare to another morbius trailer.....
well after 2 years didn&#39;t got the chances to see moribus in 2020 and 2021 but since in 2022 we did after april 1 2022 it was not bad it was so cool now they connect moribus and venom world to the mcu multiverse saga. it gonna be fun.
Jared Leto definitely killed the iconic role of the movie Morbius in the year 2022. He&#39;s definitely more than an MCU character in Sony Spider Man Universe😎🔥
The music for this trailer is amazing!

I don’t care what the critics say, I enjoyed this movie

It&#39;s a very good trailer fr
Uhm, Actually..Morbius is bad🤓
When Dr. Michael Morbius turned his head slowly as the camera zoomed in on him and said &#39;Oh yeah....There&#39;s alot Morb where that came from&#39; ASTOUNDING. What a movie.
it was here,<br><br>a legend was born
When he said &quot;May the morb be with you&quot; I got chills. It had some of the characters and dialogue of all time
We should get the Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes up to 100%! This movie is 100% a movie!

An excellent movie. One destined to come back to the theatres every “Morb-day” (anniversary or the original release). May the Morb be with you!

Remember when the teaser was better than the actual movie
Great film Jared Leto was excellent 10/10 film I think it’s very realistic how they brought Morbius character to life lots of action suspense &amp; never a Dull moment.. must see film!!💯😎👏🏼👏🏼
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=104">1:44</a> Ah yes, the average Morbin Enjoyer
MORBid
This was the most movie ever made. The actors acted, the script was written, and the plot is there
I&#39;m about to MORB!!!
Jared Leto was the perfect actor for this part he did a excellent job and he looked phenomenal when he turned to Morbius his body was crazy fit this movie will keep you on your toes lots of action suspense and fighting scenes Morbius is vicious strong and realistic looking it’s so crazy to see them bring the cartoon to life this movie deserves a 10 I hope they make a 2nd Morbius Film! This movie was better than venom versus carnage 💯 A must see film there is also credits after the film! Best  movie to Own for sure!! Jared Leto was Brilliant 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💯❤️ great story line on this film 🎥
it&#39;s so funny thinking about how I was genuinely excited for this movie lmfao
I just saw it rn I loved it people hate it a lot but I loved it loved the slow motion fight and when he was getting shot at
Ain&#39;t gonna lie, I was actually excited for this movie when I saw this specific trailer. The music goes quite well and how it&#39;s edited is also awesome. Other than that...... Yeah .....................
It&#39;s great to see all those pre-morbius comments, the world didn&#39;t have an idea about what it about to withness
This movie is the hieght of cinema. The fact that it had actors, had a plot and dialogues and had an ending makes it one of the movies out there. I&#39;m happy this film beat Endgame and Avatar by 6969 morbillion dollars.
It&#39;s Morbin&#39; Time!
¿Por qué sacan películas de gente que nadie pidió, y si las sacan por qué no se esfuerzan en contratar a un guionista decente? <br>Bueno menos mal que sacaron la película porque nos dio horas de diversión, IT´S MORBIN TIME
I can&#39;t believe that we had to wait two years for this masterpiece
I hate when they put stuff in a trailer that they NEVER put in the movie, like Michael jumping off the walls in Milo’s house and obviously killed someone that he regrets killing

Being a jokester is temporary, but going all out as a vampire will always be eternal.
Truly was one of the morb morbies of morb time. Can’t get morbier than Morbius.
Man, I still remember the part of &quot;it&#39;s morbin time&quot;. I literally grabbed the guy next to me and hugged him strongly. I couldn&#39;t believe it happened. Truly masterpiece.
This was definitely a movie

Not only was it a movie, it was a screenplay.
This is cinema<br>-Martin Scorsese
It&#39;s morbin time
If Beethoven was alive, he be copyrighting this
who would have know this would be the greatest movie ever made, that it would change so many lives, made countles morrbillions and introduce us to the greatest scenes in movie history and the famous quote &quot;It&#39;s morbin time&quot; (i use it every day)
Is he a hero or a villain
Wasted potential...if anything that&#39;s a goddamn understatement.
What happened to the Fur Elise References? Sony cut so much in those 2 years
I cried a morbillion tears when he said &quot;I&#39;m going to Morb&quot;.
fun fact: they want to use minecraft steve as an antagonist but sony decided that changing morbius into ender dragon is planned for sequel
<b>It&#39;s morbin time</b><br><br>&quot;Морбиус&quot;- это без преувеличения лучший фильм в истории человечества. Нам дали на столько прочувствовать гениально прописанного героя в лице Доктора Майкла Морбиуса, что когда он сказал фразу, которая стала крылатой и встала в один ряд с изречениями Конфуция, Ницше и других знаменитых философов и, осмелюсь сказать, даже превзошла их, &quot;Время морбить&quot; весь зал начал кричать, плакать и аплодировать так, что не каким &quot;Мстителям:Финал&quot; и &quot;Человек-паук:Нет пути домой&quot; даже не снилось. Лично я, и все приближённые ко мне люди, смотрят &quot;Морбиуса&quot; примерно 5 раз в день, чтобы прикоснуться к величию этого фильма, который стал символом эпохи. Каждая сцена в этом фильме великая, и никто не решится это оспорить. Но не смотря на это я могу выделить любимую, которая и в одиночку могла сделать фильм лучшим в истории человечества, но так как весь остальной фильм не менее велик, она лишь стала ярким украшением, алмазом в короне, вишенкой на торте в  фильме. Эта сцена это танец одного из главных и любимых мной героев Майло. Хореография в этой сцене безупречна, каждое движение передаёт долгий путь персонажа и рассказывает, как он дошёл до этой точки своей истории. Игра актёра в этой сцене - шедевр,она углубляет нас в повествование, и мешает дышать от напряжения и увлечения просмотром. Актёр 10000% заберёт за эту роль Оскар, как впрочем и все другие награды. Да что актёр сам фильм заберёт Оскар  во всех номинациях, и это будет заслуженно. Многие люди , которые не могут понять всё величие этого фильма, решат, что он ужасен. Мнение этих людей я не советую даже читать. <br> В заключение я хочу порекомендовать посмотреть &quot;Морбиуса&quot; всем любителям высокого кино и он безоговорочно встанет в ряд с такими шедеврами мирового искусства, как &quot;Веном 2&quot;.Что подтверждают сборы фильма в 10028918 морбиллиардов. <br><br>1000000000/10
Funny that this movie has more blood than venom 2.
It’s morbin time
The scene where Morbius morbed all the enemies and said &#39;You&#39;ve morbed your last bius&#39; I legit morbed my pants.
Ah yes, this is one of the movies of all time. It has characters and dialogues too.
I dreamed about watching morbius in my dream and when I woke up I was dissatisfied with my life so I decided to take my life and die for morbius. (I will go to Morbheaven for this)
Truly a Marvel Legend! Can&#39;t wait for Morbius: It&#39;s Morbin Time, I watch this film for the Morbillionth time!!
Best film I’ve ever seen i even stared crying when he said it’s morbin time
Was the movie in history
Why many scenes were removed from morbius movie
ITS MORBIN TIME
Wow the “best movie ever”
It&#39;s the most movie ever!!!!!
It’s morbin time
Funfact: my granpa was get morbed 1 morbillion years ago
its morbin time
Very amazing movie because of &quot;it&#39;s morbin time&quot; and breaking bad references
Finally, a perfect movie. It even plays Fur Elise in the back ground.
This was before the Morbing
When he said &quot;i&#39;ts morbin time&quot;, that changed movie history
I love Morbius
Whatever the Movie Is. This Trailer Was Dope 🔥
well worth the wait
It&#39;s morbin time.
This deserves 10 Morbillion views
Can’t wait for the upcoming sequels:<br>Morbius 2: more bius <br>Morbius 3: The Morb the merrier <br>Morbius 4: Back for Morb
I thought the movie would be cool... for real
this trailer morbed me so much i watched the movie morbilion times. IT&#39;S MORBIN TIME!
This movie is so good i am just morbed my body in the theater
This is actually better than the movie we got
I&#39;m so sad to see this trailer again, after i witnessed the final trailer after i saw the movie some friend talked me into... this trailer would have made the movie look actually kinda decent.
Got the morbs.
this trailer did actually hyped me
If this was well organised and well thought of, it should have been a good movie.
i just morbed so hard.

one of the movies of all time. sold 200 morbillion dollars. the way morbius said: “it’s morbin time”, it gave me chills.
If you are back to this trailer ,after few years . Then you know this movie is masterpiece
The day the history of cinema changed forever when Dr Michael Morbius said those famous lines &quot;It&#39;s Morbin Time&quot;
Morbius Sweep
It&#39;s crazy to think this movie, this absolute phenomenon was foreshadowed 2 years before
He has morbed
so technically this is the real Bat-Man
Marvel legend 😂😂😂
THE GOAT MOVIE, I AM MORBING MYSELF OVER IT!
The trailer is better than movie lot of scenes are not in the movie
Best movie of our time the first time I watched it, it got rid of my depression
This movie really morb into a movie
It&#39;s morbin time
This movie made me morb so hard
This is a movie
ticket sells, scripts written, actors are acting, production producing, movie is premiered &amp; directed by director.<br><br>If I rate Morbius 1-10 I would.<br>Jared Leto really an actor.
Here&#39;s a fact: the chad Morbius 2020 is way better than the virgin Morbius 2022
One of the greatest movie I&#39;ve ever seen. Period
Sony had no idea what they were getting themselves into. &quot;Morbius&quot; became the first movie to make 1 trillion dollars, so as a result they are working on the sequel &quot;Morbius and Wong&quot; which is most likely going to be even better than the first movie. Other studios such as Paramount Pictures and Pixar have attempted to rival Morbius by releasing films such as &quot;Sonic The Hedgehog 2&quot; &quot;Top Gun Maverick&quot; and &quot;Lightyear&quot; but none of them compare to the masterpiece known as Morbius.<br><br>Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Pictures Animation will probably be the only movie studios still in business by the end of the decade as they release Morbius and Wong, Morbius 3 and 4, and &quot;Morbius Into The Morb-Verse.&quot; Then the 2030s decade will bring us Morbius 5, 6, and 7, as well as &quot;Morbius Across The Morb-Verse&quot; and &quot;Morbius Beyond The Morb-Verse.&quot; Then in the 2040s decade humanity will go on to constantly re-watch all of the Morbius movies, and praise the fact that humanity will not be able to exist without them.
This is truly the greatest movie of the century. “It’s Morbin Time” will go down as one of the most famous lines in cinema history right next to “I’m your father”
The best movie ever and the first movie to sell 500 mortrillion tickets
The most movie ever
Definitely one of the movies of all time<br>It has characters and dialogue
This movie change my life
Most scenes from this trailer were cut
It&#39;s Morbin time.
It&#39;s morbin time
This is what we should of got almost half of the trailer was cut from the movie
This movie was not bad at all it was pretty good...
Morbius hype then: Violence, blood, thriller, vampire, multiverse crossover<br><br>Morbius now: <b>It’s Morbin’ time</b>
Morb&#39;d
If you want me to do anything like a thriller, first I get the money
I can&#39;t believe that how they didn&#39;t use any of the epic soundtrack and the text animation!
why there&#39;s are since I didn&#39;t see in the movie
How many bats do you want?<br>Director: yes
why was this movie delayed for 2 years?
Coming back to read these comments after the actual movie dropped.....everyone was fooled. This trailer was better than the actual movie. No Spiderman nods, Tyrese&#39;s character lost that cool looking robotic arm accessory. So many misleading things that would have changed the flow of this movie....for the better.
Who&#39;s here after the Morbius sold Morbillions tickets
With 1 Morbillions Tickets And<br>The El Muerto Movie Is Coming It Will Selled Muertillions Tickets
1 trillion morbius tickets
A lot of stuff in here isn&#39;t in the movie.
It was one of the movies ever, just couldn&#39;t see it...
What is the name of bgm??
Takty Pana zielonki.
В режисерской версии фильма, есть момент где Гарфилд с фотоаппаратом пытается заснять что-то, когда в этот момент уже за спиной его появляется Морбиус, Гарфилд чувствует опастность, поворачивается, но Морбиус пропадает, длится эпизод несколько секунд, ноооо блин какой же он пи$датый🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😊
we have been living with deaths in our midst all our lives , why can&#39;t they know how we must have felt for a change ? Michael
Deleted scene for bluray
Can’t wait for MOREbius
Well is pg-13 is so post to be rated R but PG-13 is fine
How come I&#39;ve never seen any ads for this movie until just now?<br><br>(Edit punctuation)
That funny moment when the teaser trailer is 1000x better than the finished film
Rip to all those who watched this movie lmao
this is the most trailer of all time
Morbius more like more bs. I’m sorry this is the worst film I’ve seen all year give the rights back to marvel now!
Who&#39;s coming back to the trailer for the best movie of all time

this is definitely one of the movies ever made
movie
One of the trailers ever made
Not gonna lie I know a lot of people didn’t like the movie, but I think it was necessary for future films.
remind me of Nightcrawler
The movie ever, sold 4 trillion and 5 tickets
Loved Morbius, seven out of 10
This is gopd
Yo
What a crappy movie..boring and really bad CGI..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=101">1:41</a> when your sick but take a cool shower
Great movie
It&#39;s so sad to see how good this trailer was lol
Who’s back to see all the nearly perfect scenes that were cut from this nearly horribly executed movie 😂😂
The trailer was better than the actual movie
best movie ever!
The trailer had more depth than the movie
You like Morbius
Romania. Many people believe we have vampires, but in my 666 years of living here, I haven&#39;t even seen one.<br><br>I asked my mates back in the castle and they also haven&#39;t seen any, and they&#39;ve been around for longer than I.
This is easily the most movie ever
THIS is one of the movies, ever

Marvel and Sony: &quot; Lets make a new different movie about...

If you told me that this movie is gonna come out 2 years later, i’ll laugh at you
I thought this was a teaser trailer not a whole damn  plot summary
Peak cinema, nothing compares to this masterpiece
What a disappointing movie

They CUT the Keaton scenes and replaced them with even dumber Keaton scenes
There&#39;s so many more scenes in the trailer than in the actual movie 😭
Kinda curious how they were going to explain Adrian Toomes before Loki and No Way Home...
I think Morbius should get his own M rated video game. And hopefully they would make him a supernatural vampire rather than a pseudo vampire. But without any of the traditional weaknesses and drawbacks of supernatural vampires. Basically making him a vampire god.
I wonder where that scene would&#39;ve lead to at the end of this trailer.  &quot;Whats up, doc?&quot;.

I would love to see this movie. The morbius we got was not this movie
Since corona many movies is already show. After two years in same movie they show up again.
Worbius
I’m not even surprised that it outsold Avatar and Endgame
Morbius &gt;&gt;&gt; The Raimi trilogy and Spider-Verse
this definitely was the movie of all time

I didn&#39;t know this teaser trailer was released in 2020...
So this was really a bullshit trailer. The fact that Sony thought it was cute to include Tobey Spidey, Oscorp, Vulture just to make this film be talked about is disgusting.
God damn, Morbius was one of the movie I&#39;ve ever seen, so with it&#39;s cgi and dialogue
this is what edward cullen thought he was to bella in twilight
Wait we got a trailer for morbius in 2020?
This was the simplest superhero movie I’ve ever seen. You can tell how heavily edited down it was. What a disappointment.
They cut a Lot of scenes...
Bruh.. we waited two years and we still confused lol.
Anybody here after seeing the movie? XD
This movie should die years ago.
Let&#39;s see Paul Allen&#39;s Batman<br><br>Paul Allen&#39;s Batman:
I never thought I would get so bored with a Marvel movie
A dead channel.....
Marvel and Sony Realized they played themselves when they put Mcu Vulture in a Non Canon (At the time) Marvel movie it now  makes sense now why they Waited until after Spider man no way home to release this movie
FIRST TRILLION DOLLAR MOVIE
plot twist: keanu reeves is dracula
Ok ok not  much better 😏
Morbius, part human and part super vampire. Marvel did a good story about Morbius.
I just seem this movie it was fire omggggg
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=98">1:38</a> batman v superman scene
When the entire teaser trailer was better than the movie
This fur elise theme song not coming in the movie
That scene with Keaton was definitely changed in the final film
After seeing the movie I can see that they cut a lot of stuff. Like holy this doesn’t even feel or look like the same movie.
yikes
We Live In A Society Where Joker Found A Way To Become Batman But More SCARY...
Honestly i like the trailer more than the movie
i came of the future to say that the movie is horrible, probably the worst of all the Marvel recent pictures
😂
1 trillion tickets
The Spider-Man with murder on the wall has more meaning now after NWH
After seeing this there’s a lot they cut
Could’ve been something
2020 OMG…
Whoever edited this trailer should have edited the movie =).<br>Overall a decent flick worth seeing, not as good as Iron Man, not nearly as bad as Black Widow. Similar to Venom 1 in terms of quality.
This is borderline false advertising
Jesus it’s hilarious how much was cut out
It was pretty predictable that this movie was going to to do bad
this trailer honestly got me hyped for a time
They went so full into the trailer that watching this now, i honestly loved the trailer more than the movie
I already watched the Morbius movie it was a very good 🎥🍿
Lmao, worst comic book film since that Catwoman movie with Hale Barry
Just came back from the cinema, great movie! Can anyone tell me the music, cause it&#39;s no where to be found. Especially the music from the middle to end of the movie. Loved the darkness of the movie and the music most!
I actually really enjoyed this movie, not sure why it was so hated lol. Thought it was entertaining, cool concept, and was invested in the 2 main characters.
Dont be fooled by this great trailer movie sucks
I love how there are soooo many parts of this movie that got edited out or didn&#39;t make the cut.
This trailer was better than the whole movie
the amount of deleted scenes this movie has bro
Anyone here after watching the movie?<br>Whats your opinions? I found the movie not much convincing, but ya, it was good.
Have you ever seen a good movie with Leto as main character, exactly…<br>Completaly 💩
Literally trailer is better than the whole movie , there was no need to go with a connection with NWH , could have just used the variant thing
The movie was soooo different from the trailers, felt like it was all a scam honestly
Sony you fucked us real good with this one. <br>I wish I was drugged when it happened. <br>😩😩🤬🤬
Patrick Bateman: let&#39;s see paul allen&#39;s batman
Who’s here after seeing Morbius to look back on how much was cut out 😔
Holy crap this was trash
Midbius
trailer was 100X better than the movie
LMAO WHERE DID THIS MOVIE GO
False advertisement
Just fame back from the movie. I’m gonna give you all a minor spoiler:<br><br><br><br><br><br>There are a LOT of shots and lines in this trailer that we do not see in the movie. It feels like these scenes would have added more depth and background to the story. Instead what we get is kinda meh
This was a good movie. I hate the flack it&#39;s getting. Hopefully this story continues
Damn the trailers were so GOOD. Why was the movie BLEGH. SO MUCH POTENTIAL.<br>We had a great story from the trailers and all that was just dumped. <br>I’m not angry I’m just disappointed dude :(
Wow this movie is so bad
Maybe high expectations was a bad thing
peak
I just watched it today it was insane
Rip
2 years till the actual movie comes out
So this is Andrew timeline.hope we get amazing Spiderman 3
Welp
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> it wasn&#39;t Tobey Macguire universe at all. It was Andrew Garfield universe the whole time!!
This is the movie I wanted to see this trailer is amazing, but the results that us fans got was so crucial and disappointing. Do better Sony
Watched this in Theatre. Too much changes has been made from this trailer. Why? I mean there&#39;s a lot potential for this character. I&#39;m disappointed and hype at the same time for this character.
After watching the movie this is literally the whole movie 😂
Almost half of the shots in this trailer aren’t in the finished film.
Who is here to see all the deleted scenes after seeing the movie?
they cut that scene showing spider man out at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a>, I was hoping to see it in the movie but it still wouldn&#39;t have made it any better lmao
I watched this movie and I actually LOVED it !!!! I want more !
Is this the new batman movie?
Yo... this music bruh... i like it a lot... especially the dude humming along to the melody... that was very nice
just watched it, they took out or did not put alot of scenes in the movie
morbius was abhorrently dreadful
Midbius
The only thing that made us excited for this movie at this time was Adrian Toomes. <br><br>How the movie actually treats him is insulting.
me habeis tenido dos años esperando espero que me encante mañana la vere
Worst movie
Bruhhh the end credits made no sense
False advertisement
Honestly this movie is good, but there are some scenes that make you bored
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=124">2:04</a>
Tommorow release 😌
19% on rotten tomatoes..... not worth the wait

It’s finally here
Yoo That Spider-Man On The Wall Is Definitely Tobey Maguire It’s Uncanny
MID
At least it drops in April.
Who here thinks that this is its best trailer?
This is depressing,how sony made this sh t movie and baited us all for two years.
can&#39;t wait!!!!!!!
A few more days and this movie comes out! Will make box office history!!!!
This guy used covid as his antidote and moreover this helped him give him many superhuman abilities 😈 (don&#39;t try this irl)
Two years ago lmao
Marvel releasing this trailer 2 years ago while fans waiting for Thor:Love and Thunder which is coming out in less than 4 months
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> spiderman🙄
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> is that tobey maguire spider man 🥵
God two years ago now it’s just releasing
Not watching the movie, everything they said was cap.
I just can’t believe Sony cut all of Vulture’s scenes and all of the Spider-Man references. The reviews are calling this film god-awful. I’m seeing it next week, and hopefully it surprises me.
another movie when the trailer is good but the movie is trash
another movie when the trailer is good but the movie is trash
This really came out two years ago damn 💀💀💀
🧑🏻‍🔬🧬🦇🧛🏾
😲😲😲
Omg 😂
2 years…
You are THE BEST 👍
Good to know that the Spider-Man &quot;MURDERER&quot; graffiti and the end of the trailer with Michael Keaton will not be in the actual film.
midbius
Never knew this trailer came out in 2020, Bloody hell.
Lol it&#39;s Been 2 years
“Where is spider-man?” He was gone for two days in another universe
I totally forgot that he&#39;s a rapist. You&#39;d think he could find someone that WANTS to sleep with him..he must get off on the lack of consent part
Bro the trailer came 2 years ago and the movie is barely coming 💀
Anybody from 2022?
Out of all the trailers for this movie, this is my favorite. Music to this rocks.
So, Rasputin got covid?
That’s hilarious this movie still isn’t out
I heard the music somewhere...🤔🤔🤔
What is the name of music??????
OMG THIS MVIE MORBIUS 2022 April 1st it comes out at The Odeon witch I am definitely going to be seeing it can&#39;t wait
TWEAKER!
Happy 2 year anniversary to this trailer
Good trailer he should fight Blade and Spider Man.
it&#39;s literally 2 years old teaser! 😐😵

this was uploaded two years ago, what?
Mom I need Batman<br>Mom- We have Batman at home<br>Batman at home-<br> Although I love the trailer super excited for the movie😂
I am seing This Trailer 2022 Feb 28
Jan 13 2020 damn it&#39;s been more than 2 years and we still haven&#39;t seen this movie
Wth this was 2 years ago?? Im sure i saw this like month ago. <br><br>Im sure someone are ruining the timeline rn
It&#39;s crazy how this trailer came out TWO YEARS AGO, like what????
Who released a movie over 2 years after the trailer drops?
For my whole life, i didn&#39;t even know if this trailer really existed.
Definitely MCU
Morbius and venom is better than spider-man i think?
Marvel forgo 💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=158">2:38</a> To see the &quot;Joker&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; together in one movie. I like the sense of subtle humor from the writers 🤣
There is an Beethoven Fur Elise remix in the sound track 😂
Morbius was one of my favourite villains in Spiderman 1994 animated series.. i loved it.. i wish this movie comes out soon
This movie never coming out
His 50 year&#39;s old omg
Will this be part of MCU?
Bruh…. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=128">2:08</a> you can see Adria Arjona’s character Martine Bancroft laying on the ground dead or dying, presumably from a gunshot wound. How could they be so sloppy in leaving this in the trailer???
Well. Finally a film of COVID-19
Can this movie 🍿 pull it off I believe yes as looks like it was done well. Blade was good too but died out go figure. This looks like a better vampire character with much more character and more complicated in his direction of actions with good and bad.
Seeing the Tobey Spider-Man now from a trailer 2 years ago… 🤌🏻
The trailer released 2 years ago
When the hell is this movie coming out cause they said it&#39;s coming out in January 2022 now it&#39;s February soon march so what the hell is going on
Spoilers.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Peter Parker&#39;s blood was fundamental in creating Morbius as we know it.<br>From Spiderman Animated series.
Great! Another Batman movie!!!
God I this trailer has me super hyped.
This trailer is the reason why I decided to learn fur Elise on piano
This is 2 years old?
Ake sangithe ape rathe thiyana chun pan vage
So this guy started the coof.
what is the name of the music please, it is a piece from a symphony?
Been 2 years haven&#39;t came out yet
This dude is the final variant boss
It&#39;s been two year already
so r we gonna see blade?
My sister was pregnant when this trailer first came out now her kid is almost 2 years old
Take Salvatore brothers
The teaser was released 2 years ago but the movie hasn&#39;t released yet.
This is  literally bat-man
I’m gonna keep coming back here
April 1st everyone
We all forgot this movie was coming out because the trailer was too long ago
3 years in the making and it’s still not out
I’m from the year 2025 and this movie is still not out
&#39;&#39;only in theatres summer 2020&#39;&#39; <br>2 years later. Crickets chirping.
Anyone saw that spiderman painting and writen murderer
idk if this movie will be linked with andrews spiderman or not, but why does it looks like the toby&#39;s spiderman in the wall <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a>
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> you can see Spider-Man labeled murderer in a poster, so it’s part of the MCEU then?
I got so confused when I saw the doctor
Not to brag but this is the real bat man that I&#39;ve been waiting for😩✨
Hard to believe this trailer came out 2 years ago lol and we still haven&#39;t seen the movie... Excited to watch it on April 1... hopefully doesn&#39;t get delayed again after already being delayed for like 7 times lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> it&#39;s neither Tobey nor Tom,it&#39;s Andrew.
Think it. Morbius is the real Batman.
The suspensful paino in the back sounds partly like fur elise
How far are we allowed to go to fix something that&#39;s broken? Until the remedy is worse than the disease
Trailer says that this summer but they did not tell what year lol
Truly at this point I think this movie it will be better if they cancelled, or the story of the new mutants would repeat.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> murderer spider-man is that Andrew vers
No way this way 2 years ago wtf
&quot;we live in a society, <br><br><br><br><br><br> where movies are release 2 yrs after their teaser&quot;
I have a theory, we all saw the whole murderer spiderman on the wall and the vulture cameo all of which go with the main mcu. But I believe that is simply a red herring pulled by sony. I&#39;ve read and seen that the murderer spiderman has been seen in Tobey Maguire&#39;s spiderman series, as well as some hints towards Oscorp, which is also in the Tobey Maguire&#39;s spiderman series. So, in theory, I believe this will take place in that &quot;universe,&quot; it being separate from Tom Holland&#39;s spiderman but still connected thanks to venom who was seen as being left behind, at least a bit of him, in the final cutscene of far from home. Perhaps the new Dr. Strange movie will show some form of him or even venom who is still kickin&#39; in Tobey Maguire&#39;s spiderman, just with someone new. Or maybe I&#39;m pulling lose ends and calling it a blanket. Who knows :)
2 years later... 2 YEARS
superb xXx
this better be MA15 at LEAST.
If u skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> it shows Tobey Maguire spiderman
very nice !
spiderman❤
It was teased 2 years ago bruh
If Batman was bitten by a radio active Bat!
If they ever bring back blade, they could make for a cool crossover.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> is that Andrew or Tobey?
SPIDER-MAN IS DEFINITELY IN THE MOVIE
Jared Leto has just confirmed This movie has been held in The Amazing Spider-Man Universe !!
It has been 2 years already?
Beethoven 💥
Got pushed back six times dude 🤦‍♂️
Happy 2 year anniversary to the trailer of a movie that still hasn’t released
Keep gangidius as hero
anyone above 50 age like these music??!
Morbius : I am inevitable<br>Blade : Ehemmm, excuse me
Trying to figure out if anyone even wants to watch this movie. I don&#39;t. No one I know does either. I don&#39;t think anyone trusts the comment section either after it was discovered there are paid shills populating it.  This trailer only has half the views of the Eternals trailer and we see how well that movie was loved by the masses. These Sony execs really need to do some focus groups and pier review on movie pitches cause...damn. This movie has bomb written all over it.
Why does he remind me of John wick
He reminds me Michael Sin, Lucian from Underworld... So much alikeness! Jared is so talented!
In 2 days this trailer will be 2 years old and the movie still hasn&#39;t come out yet
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> tobeyyy
I will be watching that only for Jared…<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Harris.
They rescheduled it.
Who knew this would come out 2 years from when it was announced
Praise the algorithm overlords
I can&#39;t wait to see this movie with my grandchildren in 2341
Remember watching this teaser trailer on January 13 2020 the first time and was Excited and Not  Upset and it is content and now coming out April 1 of 2022 Early 2019 I saw some of the filming started filming And The assistants is The MCU. The writing was done ✅ in 2018 and Watch All The Movies and shows to 16 Now 17 This Year 18 Next’s Year
This movie  can be awesome. <br>And it gived me chills  at the same  time. <br>👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Beethoven - Für Elise , Looking forward to seeing this when the theater opens, Greeds
Coming back to this after no way home :)
2 years later still waiting...
This movie was supposed to come out when I was in 8th grade. I am now a sophomore in high school somehow excited for this. Still waiting. Always.
The fact that they teased Tobey’s spider man 2 years before nwh came out-
So it’s confirmed this guy is apart of the MCU and I’m guessing since that Tobey’s Maguires Spider-Man is confirmed in the MCU and they show his suit in a drawing on the wall Morbius is in Tobey Maguire universe.
Wow... Awesome waiting To see✨👍
cant believe Sony teased Tobey Maguire spider man 2 years ago.

,df एचडी सेsjum
Its been 2 years since the first trailer dropped XD
Jared Leto is very good choice to potrey the role of Micheal Morbius ❤️
Iventus<br>Home rumah rumah menghilang kaya jumper
The fact that i had watch this again because of the delayed. oh damn
I like how this trailer released before NWH started filming... but NWH is already released...
This is a Sony movie so it might be actually Good...
This movie got delayed for the 7th time I really Hope Andrew Garfield is in it because of the rumors because the goat needs to return
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a>
Am  I the only one who thinks Loki every time I see the title Morbius
To think that spider man no way home was filmed &amp; got released in between the first release of this teaser trailer &amp; the release date of Morbius
I guarantee this movie blows. those who&#39;ve read the books will know this.
With his origin and powers we can say that he is more Batman than the original.
Morbius has delayed again
did I hear Nas&#39;s I Can? XD
didn’t the first trailer come out in like 2020? its now been two years of delays lmao
Keanu Reeves as Michael Morbius <br><br><br>Would have been so much more worth the wait
how have i just realised this trailer existed. i watched the other trailer a while ago and only now found out that there was a teaser trailer released 2 years ago
The WEREWOLF is coming!
Morbius being delayed to April gives them enough time to add Andrew Garfield into the movie.
how do we know for sure that&#39;s Adrien Tooms tho
This movie is still not released
The first teaser trailer is TWO YEARS OLD at this point and this movie just got delayed to April 1. 😂😭 my expectations are low but come on!
The trailer released 2 years before the movie looooool nice one 👍
This teaser is gonna be 2 years old already and you&#39;ll seriously going to push it back and delay the damn thing again?wtf Sony
Well seems like it’s gonna be delayed yet again. Almost a year and a half later and now we gotta wait til April lol
Delayed because Andrew cameo calling it rn
Movie got delayed to April 1st, 2022
Another Delayed 🥲
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=44">0:44</a> bee dee dum
I think this is an R rated movie just look at that creepy vampire sheesh
Now this is getting interesting. This movie was always getting released long before No Way Home. So, that Spidey on the wall could have been a placeholder to not spoil a surprise ( that the movie happens in the MCU because Tom Hollands Spidey has been framed by Mysterio ). In the final movie, perhaps that Raimi Spidey pic would have veen edited to give place to the real one in film. Now that No Way Home got released and we all know Venom came back to his universe, either Morbius will be something different or we&#39;ll be dealing ith multiverse shenanigans. Dr Strange perhaps created a whole new reality now sharing elements from other universes. Maybe that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing so many stuff from different Spidey movies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=132">2:12</a> OMG is that Doctor !!!!!
My theory is that they’re still setting up the sinister 6 for amazing 3 and possibly even another movie with the 3 spider-men!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> wtf is PS4 raimi spider man suit doing there??
Dude look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> , why the hell is tobey&#39;s spiderman murderer!
I saw this trailer in the theater while going to see the new Spiderman movie and all I focused on was the fact that Matt Smith&#39;s in it and he&#39;s not wearing a bow tie. It just feels weird.
Wowwww white people areeee vampires
Is Morbius and Venom in the same universe as TASM ?? Andrew Garfield and Tom Hardy needs to happen
I accept spiderman with 4 extra arms and lizardman to make some appear here in the movie.
I think Morbius will enter Andrew Garfield&#39;s Spiderman universe instead of Tom Holland.
The trailer was out in 2020 and the movie it&#39;s to 2022 that&#39;s terrible marketing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=56">0:56</a><br>That well known piano sound in background 👍
Hmm. More Comic-book crap to keep Snowflakes in a delusional world
my boy toby almost broke character there
Was waiting from 2020
Nice!
It looks so DC movie and I like it. 👌

Доброго времени суток, Литвяков Виктор Анатольевич попросил чтобы вы выпустили в прокат этот фильм раньше положенного срока!
Idk why but I love the parts where he sings with the music
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> that’s tobey’s Spider-Man
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> Anyone else notice that&#39;s Tobey&#39;s Spider-Man?
This remix Fur Elise is the perfect song for this character......
For people that are confused, Adrian Toomes AKA Vulture from SM Homecoming is in this movie.  Which means that Morbius is in the MCU.  They also show a picture of Tobey&#39;s Spider-Man with &quot;Murderer&quot; sprayed across it in this trailer, which not only means that this film takes place after No Way Home, but also that Tobey is now in the MCU.  The only question is if/when he will show up again.  Also, since they showed Venom watching Holland&#39;s Spider-Man on TV at the end of Venom 2, it only makes sense that Maguire&#39;s, Garfield&#39;s, and Holland&#39;s Spider-Man, as well as Morbius, Venom, and Vulture are all connected.  That is to say, they are all in the MCU.  Why else would they show Keaton&#39;s Vulture in the Morbius movie and Holland&#39;s Spider-Man in Venom 2?
Please let this be in MCU .... don&#39;t destroy the characters ..... you all guys are same as fox ..as they shit you will too
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> thats tobby maguire spider-man pic on the wall so i think this movie gonna take place in raimi verse the 1st spiderman if it is its gonna be huge
Come here after no way home
After watching No Way Home and comeback to watch this trailer, I just realized that The Spider-Man poster on the wall would likely be edited and it must be a newest version of Tom&#39;s Spider-Man. It&#39;s all make sense now.
Tobey &amp; Andrew coming back after No Way Home? 👀
Tobey coming back after No way home then? 👀
Today I watched SMFFH now this trailer makes more sense then any other
Zzz
Spidey&#39;s poster branded murderer and the multiverse appearance at the end of venom huh... looks like marvel is going all out on this one.
This guy is batman and nightcrawler combined I swear
Wow
He says I am venom and there’s a poster of Toby maguires Spider-Man having murder sprayed on it so that could means that this takes place after Spider-Man no way home
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=161">2:41</a> it&#39;s vulture wow that means their will be a crossover just like in the comic books again i think i am starting to feel like a teenager all over and not turning into a middle age man soon
&quot;SUMMER&quot; lmao nahhhh
10 days until Spider-Man: No Way Home
Pastor &amp; Morbius = Pastor &amp; Daredevil
The Spider-Man on the wall makes it seem like this is in the Sam raimi  Spider-Man universe seeing as they’ve now decided to create the multiverse with sony 🤪
Everyone forgot about this was even a film. They could&#39;ve just released it in February 2020 itself before all chaos besides waiting 2 whole years
Ok, I’m excited for this even though I still don’t know much background about this character. Seeing vulture and Matt Smith in this was a surprise too.
POV: you forgot this movie exosted
which universe he has?Tom Holland?or Tobey?i saw a poster of Spiderman of Tobey version on the wall from this trailer
this looks awful
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> the Spider-Man image shown is Tobey’s suit
We are Venom 🤣
Came her for beethoven ... Again .... !
FÜR ELSIE.
The Living Vampire
Batman🦇👱
We already have Covid-19 because of a Bat and now this 😬
this is what we call a true batman
Is Joker controlling bats now? I am lost...
Modern remix of Fur Elise is just noice
Then: Echo location<br>Now: bat radar <br><br>Really?!
<b>OK, who&#39;s stopped by from Cory Barbee/Jonathan Kleck&#39;s channel. Peace &amp; grace.</b>
Dr Who&#39;s in it. Must be good.
Is morbius friends with Angel or Spike?
Blade batman john wick lookin dapper innit
Question: What is that song?
That music makes me watch the trailer again n again... Its very addictive 😬
Just gonna tell ya guys, hes in the MCU, and there&#39;ll be a scene where he converses from the Vulture from Spiderman: Homecoming.
Eren Yaeger
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> Spider-Man on the wall it says murderer so could it be
Hmmm . . . is this going to be the post-credit for No Way Home? No references to it in the new trailer, and Keaton says he&#39;s not in NWH, but he is in this . . .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> Yo te conozco 😑
after this movie<br>fake one with bat reference = Batman<br>Real batman who has bitten by bat = Morbius
Too many Hints that indicates Morbius in NWH
you can see spiderman on the wall in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a>
This the early movie trailer probably!
Morbius Third Trailer Dropping In Late December
Música for Adele ❤️
That bgm ❤️
I&#39;m Bat Man
Okay now at least we have a better version of batman
Este teaser tráiler es realmente muy bueno
Jared Leto used to play Joker in suicide squad
The blood is dripping
Tom Holland&#39;s Spidey is gonna be f*cked up for sure.
John Wick but Morbius version.
I heard fur Elise
Thats Man Bat
I feel like Sony will be marvel&#39;s outlet for making movies on some of the darker heroes and antiheroes that they can&#39;t really make because of the Disney brand marvel has stuck on them
cool
Coldplay-Clocks &quot;am i a part of the cure, or am i a part of the disease?&quot;
So basically they copy Dracula
WOW IT&#39;S AMAZING <br>I&#39;m excited to see the film by the way what&#39;s the song name can ooze anyone tell me
If Batman actually had super powers.
Is it just me or is Jared Leto looking more like Rasputin as time goes on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> end credit scene of NWH
<b>...Because I&#39;m Batman!</b>
👌👌
Joker as batman.....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=128">2:08</a> just realised that Spiderman has silver linings on his suit, and I remember only Andrew Garfield Spiderman or Tobey Maguire had that type of suit<br><br><br>In the new morbius trailer, they also said he&#39;s been gone for 2 months, maybe the same way venom was brought into the Spiderman universe in the post credits of venom let there be carnage
THIS TRAILER AND THE COMMENTS AGED SO WELL
Ok, am I the only person who saw Matt smith at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=132">2:12</a>?
The urge to consume nut
I thought bat-man was a DC movie.
Morbius : &quot;We live In a society, Where honor Is a distant memory, Isn&#39;t right, Blade? &quot;
Bat man 😎😎😎
I&#39;m sorry but Jared Leto is an awful choice.  Such a shit person.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> sam raimi spidey on wall with the word Murderer on it

&quot;Fur elise&quot; as background music makes it more daunting 🔥
Nandor looking vicious in this one.

taradiratandanadun
Marvel is the best 💪
Yo tell marvel to RELEASE TI AFREE ON THE THING U R SAYING AND POSY IT
Who&#39;s here after the latest trailer arrived?
Apart from the music, I love the trailer
Damn Sony have a roster of most amazing actors as spiderman villians, Jared Leto as Morbius, Tom Hardy as Venom, Michael keaton as Vulture, Alfred molina as Doctor Octopus. They have better actors for the villian than the role of spiderman, I mean Tom Holland is a noob have a lot to prove as an actor.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a><br>Is it just me or the spiderman image in that scene in the background is that of Tobey Maguire&#39;s 👁👁
Horrible trailer
Oh, it&#39;s finally coming! I have been waiting for this since that first trailer. I am so there! <br><br>PS Always knew Leto was a vampire. That or Jesus :-p
Iconic🔥
omg
We all know what happens when humans and bats come together 🤔
Matt Smith ❤️
Dr Morbius was probably part of that whole Yale thing...
&quot;From the studio who brought you Spiderman homecoming&quot;. Nice try. There&#39;s a reason both the Venom movies were 💩 and Spiderman Homecoming &amp; Far from Home weren&#39;t. &quot;Marvel&quot;
My Theory :<br><br> As you can notice that all Marvel movies and shows in recent times are focusing on the Supernatural stuff like Marvel Zombies, Scarlet Witch, Agatha Harkness, Darkhold, Blade and now Morbius and Hunger, and it is rumoured that Ghost rider gonna appear in the Dr.Strange : Multiverse of Madness.I think the sudden appearance of all these things are due to a Higher Demon like &quot;Mephisto&quot; or &quot;Nightmare&quot;.<br><br>PS: Sorry for my grammar, English is my Second language:)
i think morbius is much  batter than batman
Michael Keaton: “You’re a bat man, but you’re not a Batman.”
English trailer is more powerful than hindi dubbed
I saw both raimi and mcu reference
He is getting superpowers from bat and here we are... getting corona from it
if Bats gave power ; Then China would have been most powerful.
We want no way home 2nd trailer 🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏😡😡😡
We all totally missed that Spiderman tobey maguire at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> ,untill the hype from  NWH&#39;s rumors and  official trailer coming out today .<br>Why???
It literally looking like a horror movi
Experimenting on bats i see... I say it&#39;s exactly what we want in covid 19
He said whats up doc? maybe bugs bunny will be in the movie
MORBIUS- &quot;I&#39;m Venom!&quot;<br>VENOM- &quot;I will not share my chocolate with you.&quot;
The real batman
<b>Beethoven&#39;s Fur Elise.!!</b> 💥👌
I love the way Matt Smith has got his little Doctor walk on 😂😂

Goosebumps 🌟🌟
Batman and Bat man

Please release tamildub
This is going to be a awesome movie
Sony is confirming that morbious is the reason behind Corona
Use of Fur Elise is awesome in the trailer
they should have kept mozart in the second trailer as well
Audience:- In which universe this movie&#39;s gonna take place?<br>Sony:- YES.
Watching it after the official trailer launch.xD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> spiderman spotted
Morbius is finally getting released it&#39;s about time!!!!!!!
Just like Trump said - “until the remedy is worse than the disease 🦠 “ talked about Lockdowns and Covid… see where Biden has brought us? To the brink of nothingness.. no new cars, endless waits for goods and merchandise.. the remedy IS worse than Covid… and we’re living proof. The world is worse off now than before. Gas and everything has gone up 50%…. Remember, you voted for that asshole in office. Don’t make the same mistake 3 years from now.
me: is this a marvel movie?<br>marvel: yesn&#39;t
Murderer 😳😳😳
Batman <br>Real id se aa na‼️😅
Wait a damn year for a second trailer and I&#39;m not disappointed at all
Mount up for Morbius. James Willems is probably ecstatic. Especially with the CGI 👏👏
From the studio that brought you Amazing Spid... oh we don&#39;t talk about this one, do we ?
Please be Rated R!!!!!!!!
This is absolutely insane, two years later will the movie be released. Wow, time flies but damn!
Finally Trailer is coming💯
YEA<br>YES<br>YAY<br>YEAH!!!
So...his power is Covid-19???<br>Love the Fur Elise remake 👍👍
Morbius the Living Vampire made a cameo appearance in a deleted scene from the 1998 live-action film Blade, portrayed by director Stephen Norrington. The scene was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release. Marvel Entertainment denied Blade II director Guillermo del Toro the rights to use the character.
One year ago!?
With this movie both Jared Leto and Michael Keaton will have played characters from both DC and Marvel. Leto in Suicide Squad as The Joker and the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, while Keaton will have participated both in this universe as well as the MCU and as the titular Batman in the DC Film Universe.
So no ones going to talk about tobeys spiderman in the background?
so morbious teaser trailer was released one year before the main trailer today, so NWH teaser....🥲
Wow 1 year
I just found put this teaser existed
Just remind me of Dettlaf van der Eretein
So Joker loved Batman soo much that he became a Bat
Hey everyone. I have to be honest Jared Leto looks really great in this role. The teaser trailer wasn&#39;t bad but it did not hype me up or anything. But this trailer made me feel more excited for the film. I like what I am seeing. CGI looks good and i am liking the tone. I do find it funny they use the Sam Raimi spider-man suit and its a shot from the Spider-Man PS4 or PS5 game. Regardless I like the references to Venom and showing Michael Keatons Vulture. This looks super interesting. Hopefully this film will be a good one.
The best part of the this trailer is the classical vampire music
Why am I just now hearing about this movie???
I wish they stick to this track for the movie instead the one used in new trailer.... this one just slaps.
So he&#39;s COVID-19 Man?
Last time man got close to bat we got Covid. This new variant seems promising
‘ I am venom’
That piano clean as fuk
This trailer is better than the 2nd one
Morbius is corona ka baap 😜😜
Is that Fur Elise in the background?
joe mama
who else noticed fur Elise playing in the backgroud
Who else is here that Morbius returned
Who&#39;s here after sony released its trailer after 1 year !
Damn sony this universe has fast and furious as well!?!
they better not kill tyrese gibson or else a bald guy with a car gonna show up.
it is promising than Venom 2 and eternals trailer too.
Who else noticed spiderman poster on trailer
STOP CUTTING THE PALM OF YOUR HAND FOR BLOOD. I mean, you use your palm alot.....
Does this mean they couldn&#39;t fix the multiversal issues?
Let&#39;s see Michael Morbius card.
This looks so bad,  like a fan -made trailer. Yikes
Mobius makes more sense than bat man..
I prefer this version to the last one!
Morbius, Dorpheus, Orpheus<br>Go eat some walruses<br>Orifices, Porridges<br>Morbius, Morbius<br><br>Going to the Buffet and Walruses<br>Corpheus, Corpseses<br>Worcestershire sauce<br>Go into your orifices<br><br>Red pill, blue pill<br>Morbius, Walruses<br>Seashells by the Seashorpheus<br><br>Morbius drinking a forty in a death basket!
THE MUSIC IN THIS VIDEO IS REALLY AWESOME
I told you Batman is in MCU
Wtf is doctor who doing there is the real question
first
I’m really confused. So by the newspaper and the mentioning of San Francisco and venom you would assume it’s in the Sony verse. But then you see Adrian Toomes. Which would indicate he’s in the MCU. Idk it seems like don’t use just going to use Disney till they get a large enough universe made then just take back there characters all together
Now that tobey&#39;s spiderman is on NWH that poster behind morbius makes sense.
Yessss
Covidman
The most generic marvel capeshit ever
Is this on the mcu
Morbius: I am Venom.<br>Venom: l am Looser🧐🧐🧐.
Who&#39;s came here after watching the new trailer 😈
Oo
I thought trailer is released today 2 Nov,2021
Can I like this twice?
I know why you pressed &quot;Newest First&quot; .😎
I love that they&#39;re playing fuer elise in the background while he&#39;s turning into a vampire 🤣
Este tráiler está mejor que el nuevo
Who is here after the second trailer
Beethoven music. Wow.
Blade
TASM verse movie, please release in Indian languages including Telugu,Tamil, Malayalam,Kannada,Hindi 🤘
Imagine a cameo of....TOBEY
If marvel creates something, it relates with the main MCU (our lovely universe)
Everybody talking about the trailer.<br>Meanwhile me: Haven&#39;t I heard this bgm somewhere?🤔😅
&quot;Web of Opportunites&quot;
am i only one who think this trailer is looking like a Dc trailer more than a marvel trailer?. 🤔 its Hell black..
bat-man
I&#39;m guessing the end credit scene is him going to come in to the mcu or he&#39;s going to see blade off into the distance
Yes, but what is doctor who doing in the trailer 🤔
Soooooooo… he’s a vampire bat 😑
Doctor who is in this movie I’m hyped
This how covid happened
The background music
I feel like he should be apart of the xmen
Movie releasing 2 years after the teaser. Wow
Plzz release spider man no way home 2nd trailer
The scene with the spiderman graffiti looks like a toby version of spiderman
From joker to morbius 😀
Nice
I liked, but please make this in Andrew world 🥺🥺😂❤️

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a>
11th doctor is hunting morbius
What is this universe where there is a Toby Spider-Man graffiti with the word murder on it and the vulture also a black cat and rhino mention too
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> tobey Maguire
I hate this.
I really hope Morbius and Andrew &#39;s spiderman meet at some point :)
Spiderman with murderer over it is a nice detail
Release the No way home trailer u Ahole
2.11 there is a picture of Spidey Tobey with the word murderer on it
At first I thought this was a doctor who spin off film biased on “ the brain of morbius” episode from the Tom baker era.. no I was wrong
So meaning the Spiderman trilogy will go on
Yo what there&#39;s so much going on
I hope people don’t dislike the trailer big time tomorrow simply because of the fact they want a No Way Home trailer.<br>Fun fact to those people. Endgame’s main trailer didn’t come out till 43 days before release. We are 46 days away right now
🕷️🕷️🕷️
DC: Can&#39;t beat the bat.<br>MCU: Become the bats.

This reminded me of vampires I am happy he is not in my universe
Fucking hell, doctor who go dark.
Why have I never seen this trailer or known that it existed until now💀
I know no one is gonna see this but just in case they do is this gonna be part of the mcu or not?
Oh look, another movie by Sony that practically requires an R rating to be done right but won&#39;t have it
It looks like a DCEU movie.
So this is a character like batman went horribly wrong 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> if u see it u see it
lmao get rekt WB for wasting good actors
I wonder if he sent his cast members dead bats to get into charecter
I didnt know there was a first trailer
So Marvel is getting Dark?<br>Thats a good sign
the movie must be cool but I felt sorry for Morbius those stupid kids were bullying him 😟😟😟😟
ok in this movie, dr.moriarty takes care of joker who is allied with batman👍
Nothing ever goes doing something with bats... well this statement speaks for itself now...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> Guys Is that Tobey Spiderman on the wall?
What doesn’t work in DC might work in MCU i guess….
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=130">2:10</a> is that tobeys Spider-Man
Repeat with me. A TEASER Trailer is not 3 Minutes long. Trailers are 3 Minutes long. This is not a teaser trailer. <br><br>(Also. Stop putting tine 5s trailers to sell us your trailer. We clicked on the video, didn&#39;t we?)
Kinda glad they kept the hype to a minimum around this, kinda sick of the excessive trailers trend
Finally!!! It&#39;s going to release : )
He in no way home
Why joker in shit marvel🤔🤔🤔<br>Sad

I really forgot about this movie, and it&#39;s out in January... Damn, Sony&#39;s marketing really sucks 🙄
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLMBLuGJTsA&amp;t=129">2:09</a> A proof that Sony won the spiderman battle, you can see a poster of spiderman on wall and &#39;Murderer&#39; written over it.
