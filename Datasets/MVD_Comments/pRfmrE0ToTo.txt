I have to move on now and I&#39;m not the man she wants now I&#39;m done I love her so much she knows I want her hand and support in my bad days so I supported her in her bad days but she already had a boyfriend in abroad and I Am here I have just started studying for a better future and she is also going progress abroad she never said this and it makes me so empty she already had a boyfriend but she always acted like I was the only one for her and made me like that but she knows I love her and I know she loves me too but she chose the future i&#39;ve waiting for her she said waiting me and I&#39;ll wait but                                              You know I want you<br>It&#39;s not a secret I try to hide<br>I know you want me but.......

I have a crush on my girl best friend and she likes my cousin (i know because she tells me whenever she gets a new crush) and we met each other back in daycare and our parents know each other pretty well. Every once and a while they come to our house and we go do random stuff like go outside and just go to our other classmates. And there was also this one time we were in a car ride coming back home from a road trip and it was midnight already so we were already sleepy and when i woke up i was sleeping on her shoulders. This song just really reminds me of her and i just wish made to be mine :)
❤❤❤❤
I love this song🫶🇵🇭💙the stars are falling with🫰

When I was younger I heard this amazing song.  I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already been five years since the song came out.  We all grew up together with these legends😢
You know when I was 7 I listened to the original and I have to say, you pulled off my fav song SO WELL. Thanks for singing this!

Ons bied aan jou Wow
❤❤❤❤❤❤😌😌😌....
This song is still amazing!! The way James said/sang Destiny just sounds different but amazing at the same time!! The way Anne just sings is incredible!! You two need to do more songs together you both sound so amazing together.
Everyone can listen but only a few who can relate can understand the song
2024 who&#39;s with me?❤

2024 👍🏻 anyone 🎧🍃
🎉❤❤❤
Perfect 🤧💗
enaken
The best❤❤❤❤
Está versión y la de Zac y zendaya ambas son increíbles!
I prefer this slightly slower paced, lower key version.<br><br>I found the official Zac/Zendaya video to be visually distracting.  I know the voices had to be redubbed over the footage, but while watching the video, I kept thinking...how could they be that physical and singing at the same time. 😂
Love this song everyday I’m vibing to itttttt
THIS IS MASTERPIECE🙌👏
This guy is good but replacing Zach effron and zendaya is unspeakable
Wow ❤❤❤❤
Lagu nya casis

5 años después, amando esta joyita &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
The thought of the lyrics is great plus the singers&#39; voices are amazing, but the concept of the MV is not suited.
It&#39;s been a year i always play this music , the reason is she left me 😢

Gw indonesia sendiri
I fell in love with this one. Reminds me of the purest love I had to let go of. We were worlds apart. I felt I couldn&#39;t be everything I was supposed to be for him so I let go and let it to continue to kill me slowly.. I keep hoping though, that some day in future..maybe, just maybe, we&#39;ll find each other again and if that never happens, I will keep that part of my heart that I gave him forever. Until next time my forever love
❤❤❤❤💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯

El significado es hermosamente perfecto puede ser de un hermoso laso amistoso o talvez de una linda historia de romance,es muy profundo,me hace querer luchar por un amor tan mágico como lo quiere describir está canción y sentirla en una noche estrellada.<br>Ok,la vos de Anne Marie y James Arthur es tan sublime qué bibra todos mis sentidos.
