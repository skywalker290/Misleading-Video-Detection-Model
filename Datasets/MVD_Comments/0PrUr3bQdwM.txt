LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😊🎉
This was the first MKBHD video I watched, as a review before buying the phone. Stuck with both of them since then. 😂
What a beast still remember my days with this device fuckin best purchase ever
My One Plus 6 was submerged for four hours in 6 inches of water when i went kayaking
The thing is google pixel phones do not provide Option of do not validate under ca certificate whereas one plus I think does .....which should I buy?
fortnite and markass brownie
Typing on Oneplus 6 in 2023
Still the most legendary 1 plus ever haha
Even after 5 years, Still I&#39;m watching this video in my OnePlus 6. 😂❤
The downfall of oneplus has been insane
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
why does your PS4 look like that
Still have the OP6 in 2023. It&#39;s still a solid phone and I love it. Having some issues with Bluetooth, started happening after the android 10 update. But i think it&#39;s time to let it go. Maybe going for a Samsung next, or even worse, an iPhone, see what I have been missing on haha
Best phone I&#39;ve ever used easy
I feel proud watching this video 5 years later on my OP6
Still great
Still using this phone from 2019, it&#39;s fire. <br>Besides the battery, this phone meets my needs.
Even at the time this was mediocre compared to Zenfone 5z...the hype carried this and poco f1.<br><br>Masses are stupid.
going back 6-7 years to look at what phones were and seeing how they haven&#39;t changed at all, they haven&#39;t. phone have peaked. it&#39;s over. caring about phone specs these days is meaningless. onto the next emerging technology...
I am using this phone from its launch ... And it still works amazing including gaming ....  🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
This was peak OnePlus. 7 pro was great too, it traded the headphone jack for stereo speakers. But 6 was peak, taking price into consideration.
i see mkbhd is bias right there... promoting oneplus paid by then
Why is no one talking about his shirt
I&#39;m still using my OnePlus 6 phone 4 years later. The battery is quite bad and, without battery saver on, it dies really quickly. However it charges insanely fast so it&#39;s not really a problem. I once dropped it in water but the only noticeable change was the speaker quality — but even that got fixed after playing music at maximum volume and once the water had evaporated. It&#39;s insanely durable — I only have a single crack. It&#39;s gotten somewhat slow and pictures sometimes take 5 seconds to take (and the cameras are quite bad). But, for playing music, texting, looking at YouTube, browsing social media, writing, etc. it&#39;s still a good phone.
2023
that was my first smatphone and now after 4 years i switched to pixel because oneplus is not the same
OMG! I love Rocket league 😮🚀⚽💥🚙🥅💯
Watching this video after my beloved OnePlus 6 died for the good after repairing it for 3 times and spending half the amount I purchased it for. Used it for 4½ years. Great phone and was really worth the price.
Remember when 6 hours was killer battery life? Only five years ago.... Nowadays, 6 is &quot;average&quot; or even less than average. 8 is high, 10 is amazing. (Obviously I&#39;m talking about high-use screen-on time)
dident watch the video not sure if he sai´d of the hung of shit is anny good, but i have haid it for 2 years or 3 dont really rember. But OH LORD ITS BAD its fucking HUGE and rater hevy expenif as fuck, but with all of thses the phone is ushaly good. HELL NO THE PHONE IS SO GOD DAMMN BAD its slow REALLY bad respons on the screen anoying start where u have to press sum duumbass rings, the bateri god REALLY shity after like half a year and the worst part,the signal HOLY FUCK its bad it does barly conekt to my internet same with calls when im calling some one they hear me bad i head them bad, but there are sum goos things with it like the camer for the 1st week after thet the camera is shit. and... oh yeh that whas evrything.
.
why am i watching this on 2023 <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a>
The Golden days when OnePlus used to be the Value king are now gone.
Why YouTube suggesting me this in 2023 ? 😕
2023 and I&#39;m still using my OP6. Been more than 4.5 years now. Recently replaced my battery and it&#39;s back to being as good as a new one. One of the best phones ever. Although I stopped from updating to Android 13, because that wrecks the phone. With Android 12 it works like a charm till date. Best buy ever.
It&#39;s really sad to see how one plus has changed through the years ;(
4.5 years later, still 2-3 day battery life and still running as well as day 1.<br><br>10/10 phone, I&#39;m honestly considering getting another one.
It&#39;s recommend after 4 years...!
i remember this phone
watching this on an OnePlus 9 🗿
Using my OnePlus 6 with Custom Roms. Still great, decent battery life.
Anyone here seeing this in last 2022
Bro please turn off ads
Good old one plus days❤
Hi Marques, great review on the OnePlus 6 - I am 60 and am still looking at purchasing my 1st smart phone but not sure if I want to spend 5-$600 on a iPhone 11 or XR cause it will still get updates etc. I do not plan to do any $$ bank transfers I just want one for using maps, phone calls, texting and watching some Youtube vids - I have seen a 2nd hand one for sale here in NZ would you recommend me purchasing this for NZ$319 or do you think that I would be better off spending the extra 250 on a later model phone- and for the record I do have a mobile (Doro flip top) it&#39;s not so smart but what ever I get it will be a huge improvement. LOL
Any of you using the OnePlus 6 in 2022? <br>I am :) Works well yet !
Back in 2018 when this phone launched I was wondering how cool it was like having a similar display to the Iphone x and top of that it had the Snapdragon 845 and fast charging and it was costing around INR 35,000. And after 4 years I&#39;m having a phone with Snapdragon 870, now it feels liks dream came true of having your own phone but 4 years is a long time. The fact that my phone cost me less than One Plus 6 and still it&#39;s great but again in 4 years my phone would suck a lot.
Still the best 👌 :)
Watching this video on my one plus 6, great phone but after 4 years it doesn&#39;t give me more than 4 hour of battery life.
Bro chill
I miss the old oneplus
Bought the oneplus 6 when it released, and 4 years back. Still running this beast. My buttons have stopped working, but the performance is still top notch and the battery life is great. Damn, what happened to oneplus?
still have my op6, unbelievable that it has been more than 4 years since I got it... but it is starting to get a little bit slower so thinking about upgrading
Retiring this great phone to an iPhone 14 pro max. It served me well till the security updates went away. Back when One plus truly cared about it&#39;s users.
watch this on 2022
After 4 years it&#39;s still going strong 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Good old days. 4 years with mine, don&#39;t want to give it up but the camera has started to hang, bunch of glitches while watching videos and the battery life has decreased. Wish they continued on this path but alas.
Ive jumped ship frm OP to apple (all in). Loved my last op8pro but it was so tall n also things seemed to go downhill frm there w hassleband gimmicks n all. I dont miss android windows or OP at all
Poorly aged
MKBHD saying: Best phone for price, Best stock like feel os, good battery, best camera for price.<br>OnePlus right now: <br>Best price - Nah, that won&#39;t work<br>Stock like feel OS - Wt, I didn&#39;t hear ya<br>Battery - LoL, talk about 8 gen 1 and color os<br>Camera - True colours from Hassleblad for $900 (still sucks)
Literally crying when u speak about Oxygen y. It&#39;s not here anymore, and sucks at top rate.
I found a BNIB lava red edition on ebay for $1,145... It was my first phone until I got scammed BAD trying to sell it.
Still using it
I&#39;m still using it.
The fact that this is his 3rd most popular video is super surprising
Mine still running like a beast <br>4 years man
this was my first android phone..i take care of my phone always..after two year of using suddenly its display gone..i don&#39;t think its value for money to me..purchased in launch date got it for 35k and after replacing display for 2.5k..i sell it for 6k..
Watching on my Oneplus 6 after 4 years. The phone has aged well but not the company!
To this day I rock thia phone! I bought it cause of this channel and content creator. It is still going strong Camara is crap but everything else is Golden !
battery still hundreds
still use the 1+ six
Watching this on my OP6 currently
Now, after 4 years, my OP6 is still going strong. Best phone I had, period! No single problem in all those years and still 40% battery life at the end of the day. Recently bought the Pixel 6 pro, but send it back because it was not an improvement over this phone. Only downside of the phone was the glass back that broke twice. After the last break, I put a protection sticker and that problem was solved. Wish I could use it longer, but 3g calling discontinued in my country and this phone does not support voLTE, so the call quality became shit. Too bad. Btw, I love the fingerprint scanner on the back. It&#39;s fast and the placement really convenient. No problem with the size at all.
I&#39;m still in love of this smartphone (even if now I&#39;m on OP 7 Pro)
My last Android phone before I rejoined the iOS ecosystem
The top days of OnePlus!
those golden days r long gone. oneplus has lost it&#39;s charm &amp; turned themselves into a shitty company 😩😩
Hey marques. I&#39;ve used a OnePlus 6 for 3 years up until a week ago when I purchased a OnePlus 9. I&#39;m tempted to go back to my 6. The 9 feels heavy and cheap in comparison. Pixels per inch is identical and although the speed of charging blows my mind on the 9 it was amazing on the 6 too. <br><br>Do I save £429 and send my 9 back? 🧐
The last with headphone jack!! 😌
I still own a Oneplus 6 and it runs just fine. Yeah, I am one of those unlucky ones who&#39;s software experience was impacted by the Android 11 OTA update. But still, the bond I&#39;ve built with this phone is extraordinary. And that&#39;s makes parting with this phone really difficult, which I would have to do sometime this year.
strijder
why after 3 years??
3 yrs??! Seriously? Using the 8 pro now u recommend me this 🤣
I&#39;m just using it vanilla without rooting or anything. Its kinda slow now after the software updates. Volume down button is not clicky anymore and microphone doesn&#39;t pick up sounds as it used to (don&#39;t know if due to dirt or hardware beginning to failure.) It has held up well aside from those issues
Still rockin op6.
Ok.
Not now 3yr old marques🥲 not now 😭
Watching this in my OP6, i will be switching soon to s22+. Good bye OnePlus.
Oh how the mighty have fallen.<br>One plus has lost its identity now.
Me watching this in my OP6 in2022 still works perfectly fine 😎
2022 gang !
This is the last ever good phone from &quot;Oneplus&quot;, unlike these day
still using it and working like a dream!!!
Rocket league in the back!!
Watching this in 2022 in my one plus 6
FYI, my friend’s One Plus 6 will be bricked in around a month by the 3G network sunsetting that’s going on. Less than 4 years of life as a cellular device. He came out of no where one day when I got a new iPhone, telling me I was dumb and should have bought the One+ instead. I just wanted to be left alone, but he persisted.<br><br>The 2014 iPhone 6 will NOT be shut down, and there’s no indication it won’t work for another decade when 4G gets shut down. Not saying it’s perfect, or even better overall, but at least it works for a very long time, and gets updates for the better part of a decade.
Why is it that many of these great phones, such as the OnePlus, are not offered through the major carriers here in the USA?  You can easily find Apple, Google, Motorola, and Samsung phones BUT many of the phones you review are not available at the Xfinity Store (my carrier).  Why??  <br><br>So, do you find an Oppo or maybe an Xiaomi phone you like, then contact your carrier to see if it will work on their system?  Or is there another, possible more reliable, source you can use?  Or won’t these phones work with any US carrier?  Another question, do these less popular phones (at least here in the US), get regular software updates?  Buying  $400 - $600 mid range phone running an older Android OS that the manufacturers won’t update at least for two or three years in the future sounds crazy.
I like one plus phones but I never ever, ever buy phone with that big notch
Watching this in 2022 and remembering the golden era of Oneplus which is over now.
Rocket League.
Using OnePlus 6 for 3yrs 8months now daily and heavily... Still works like a beast. Battery life has decreased a bit, agreed. But other than that, it&#39;s my soul in a box
Watching on my Red OnePlus 6<br>Still going absolutely strong<br>One of the best phones i ever owned
Back when OPO made good phones
Yo I have noticed something that when he used to make his videos from 2016 till 2018 his voice distorted but now his video are even better!!
Better performance than any phone in 2018
I still have this OnePlus 6. Great phone! Still pretty smooth, they fixed the gestures, cameras are ok with GCam, software updates are still coming, but the Android updates are slow tho and the battery doesn&#39;t last as long as they used to. I&#39;m thinking about getting a new battery and keeping the phone for at least one more year.
Just retired my white OnePlus 6 in favor of a pixel pro 6, I just needed that telephoto for specific use.  Otherwise I could have gone another year or two.
Revisiting this review as of 15th of december 2021. Still rocking this stamina beast of a phone since launch here in Sweden. Still runs all day without trouble, biggest change is that I went from charging every other day on average to every evening. It&#39;s going to be really hard to switch from this phone, where battery, rear fingerprintscanner and chargingspeed is going to be really hard to beat even with most of today flagships!
Watching it in 2021
honestly not having wireless charging is not even a big deal even for a flagship these days
I came here Because im planning to buy the 8T
Ive been having my eye on the one plus for awhile
I changed OnePlus 6 for new iPhone 13 but... after 3,5 years of using! It still great phone!
Wallpaper ??
Still rocking it today. The camera is a bit dated now but I don&#39;t take many pictures 🤷 . Need me an aux port
Wash a dog, comb a dog, perfume a dog 🐶 still a dog is a dog. So is android. <br>Awesome review about an awful product
So iPhone 13. 🤫🤔
Watching this on oneplus 6 almost 4 years later
i want to like it, it cuts on all the things i don&#39;t need expect the battery life anything under 4000A/h feels like it dies too fast for me
I have been using OnePlus 6 for more than 3 years now and YouTube&#39;s algorithm decides to show this now.
Best device for me ever ❣️
Rip OnePlus🥺<br>OnePlus is now officially another Vivo phones.
Saw this on my recommends. And here I am, watching it on my 3 year old OnePlus 6. Love this phone
The iPhone 13 notch looks like the oneplus 6 😂
One plus 6. The best phone there is. The number 6 was absolutely the best for every phone I guess. Samsung S6, iphone 6s and oneplus 6. It just went downhill after that
My One Plus 6 got broke recently. I bought on the day of launch and used it for 3 years and 4 months. It was a beast even after all these years. I really thought I could use it for another 1.5 years. Now I am here to view Marques&#39; video again as it brings back many memories 😅🥲
Saw the full video .Nice phone <br>I might buy it...wait a minute didn&#39;t it came 3 years ago.<br>Why am i watching it in 2021.
Marques do you ever do low end smart phones?I was forced to up grade and I bought a Galaxy A12 for $198.00 and I&#39;m impressed,as it&#39;s my first smart phone???Great vid on the 1+6 but more phone than I need.What do you think?and Happy Trails!☎️
The last 1+ before it became the villain
*looks at notch in thumbnail<br>*thinks: looks same size as iPhone 13 notch <br>*looks at date…. 3 years ago!!!!
Recommended on 2021🙂 by YouTube
This was in my recommended and this 3 year old design matches with new  iphone 13
Why is this on my recommend now xD.
Does the  6t have the  metal frame  too?
Oh remember those days of One Plus? Great value for less money 🙌
Random suggestions from YouTube but loved the video!
Just purchased it and it&#39;s great 👍
Still rocking my 6T
Watching this on OnePlus 6 and yes it&#39;s still going great. Never done any format or anything.
The simplistic cemetery routinely attack because farm expectedly wrap round a hesitant fuel. equable, flimsy kettle
I&#39;m watching using Oneplus 6 in 2021 August ✌️
mine just died yesterday. rip. i&#39;ll have it framed tho lol
Literally no one YouTube recommending this to me after 3 years
Commenting this, after my OP6 finally got stable android 11 that too OTA, still no complaints after 3 years.
I still have this OnePlus 6. Great phone! Still pretty smooth, they fixed the gestures, cameras are ok with GCam, software updates are still coming, but the Android updates are slow tho and the battery doesn&#39;t last as long as they used to. I&#39;m thinking about getting a new battery and keeping the phone for at least one more year.
Please review one plus 9r
20 mil views tf
Ok so I have just now decided to try the one plus 6 in 2021.
It&#39;s 2021 and I&#39;m still rockin this beast!
I saw the launch, this review, fell in love, bought the device. It&#39;s been 3 years, still the phone is running smooth with no issues.<br>(But my next phone won&#39;t be a Oneplus. I don&#39;t want a rebranded ColorOS)
Watching this video with my oneplus 6!! The Complete Android
Here is the answer yall : 7
I have a huawei and I really like the notch on mine to be honest
OnePlus 6 without any hardware failure &amp; updated to Android 11. Most &quot;Flagships&quot; which cost twice as many wont even get A11. So Yeah.... It&#39;s right on the money..
I ask why , is it recommended now , Youtube is Dumbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb !!!!!!!!!!!! (any one else)
Probably the best phone that one plus has ever made
3 years and still works ….battery is weak (78%), still a better story than one plus 9s
Youtube:<br>2018:...<br>2019:...<br>2020:...<br>2021: here look at this
YouTube recommended me this video.
I have the red one...
Watching on a Microsoft 535 from uganda. I need some help to upgrade to android
Its June 2021. Got this recommended today, and watching it on my OnePlus 6😌
who is watching this in 2021 when all android phones have no notch and only the iphone still has one?
Three years after purchasing a OnePlus 6 and having the benefit of hindsight has led me to believe that Austin Evans did a horrible job reviewing this phone!<br><br>he said the display was trash, the camera was trash and all these other negative things about the phone but he&#39;s comparing it directly to a Galaxy s9 plus so the review was not a fair review in my opinion...<br><br>Even comparing the OnePlus 6 to the OnePlus 8 pro, I would have to say the OnePlus 6 display in particular holds up remarkably well three years later. I have both the OnePlus 6 and the OnePlus 8 pro and the OnePlus 6 display looks incredible even side-by-side to the OnePlus 8 pro display...
Why is this in my recomended after 3 years???
Still better than having phone with 700 series chip in 2021 .... <br>Still using in 2021 just replaced battery
used the OnePlus 6 for 15 months.<br>now been using a 7t for a few, rewatching this with marques saying it has bit of a camera bump behind.... bruh...
YouTube still recommending us after 3 year.....<br>😁
Anyone else got recommended this video in 2021? 😂
The way this phone looks gives me HTC vibes.
Does this phone still relevant nowadays?
Still have the One plus 6. I use it like a tractor 😂 It&#39;s still a beast.
Working superbly after 3 years
I&#39;m still using it in June 2021, never looked back and it&#39;ll still go strong the next few years. It&#39;s the Lenovo Thinkpad in form of a phone. Built like a tank, always served me well.
POV: youtube recommend you this on 2021
Still need someone to explain why this video is so popular💙
May 2021<br>It&#39;s still faster than the latest iPhone!<br>1+6 is a living legend
Nice cut Marques
The last oneplus phone
oneplus 6 is 7
Iphone 13 notch?
Instead of buying a 9 Pro, I bought an 8T, in part, because of your videos and use of it. Now, I&#39;m seeing this video for the first time. I got my 8T to replace my 6. That was an excellent phone continuing on OnePlus&#39; ethos(I&#39;ve also owned the 1 and 2 models). Sadly, that looks to be ending. Although, I did get the 8T on sale directly from OP for $529. About the same price I paid for my frost white and rose gold 6. Sadly, I later found out OP doesn&#39;t offer dual sim phones for the NA market anymore. That will be a dealbreaker for me from now on...
Well I am still using this beast after mkbhd review 🙏
wow still in top 3. Nice.
oneplus is no longer the same company and I still hold oneplus 6 which was bought after seeing this review.
Still using it also but I think battery needs to be changed, I&#39;ve only 3 hours of screen on time now :/
Using it still in 2021 nd it is as new as 2018🥰
And here we are after 2 years, in the era of OnePlus being the villian.
Quick Update :- Still works perfect after using for 2 years
Typing via oneplus 6 who else joining?
I think if I ever leave Apple 🍎 I will go with this brand or Motorola.
Best thing about this for me is - It has a &quot;Headphone Jack&quot;.
Why&#39;s it on my recommendation in 2021?
lets all agree oneplus became garbage, no feature to set it aside except for its price but then they increased the price soo its now garbage
Re watching it again in March 2021 on my OnePlus 6.<br>(Last great value OnePlus)
Thanks YouTube?
Using from approximately 2.5 years now... No complaints apart from the camera 😁
I AM using one plus 6 now 2021
hey KP will it be a good decision to buy this in 2021?

I bought this phone when it came out 2.5 urs back and am still using the same phone without any issues whatsoever. And am not planning to change my phone for atleast next 6 months. This is amazing value and twice better than an iphone.  It even looks twice better<br>I have the gloss (marble)  black the most precious shade of black i seen so far on any phone.  This and OP3 silver metal are the best Colours And Textures on any phones ever.
the answer is 7
Just give me one plus 8 😫😫
The algorithm has spoken, so here I am, almost three years later, heh. :D What the hell, YouTube?
Legends watching in 2020
Yes,not water resistant. Lost mine thinking it was
i was an Apple fanboy. till i switched to the OnePlus3. Battery/Software/Looks/gestures..... everything is top notch.
Gaming mode is underrated
Just brought 8T and now revisiting all OnePlus reviews, it&#39;s fun to watch how OnePlus matured year by year.
Watching on my OnePlus 6 Res ❤️💯
How here on  2020
Watching this on my OP 8T..... but why ???? 🤔
A sure re evaluation for today

Why is youtube recommending this video after 2 years even the phone has stopped manufacturing 🤔🤔🤔
Who is watching after oneplus 8t launch event?
Still the best value for the price OnePlus
I don&#39;t know why I am watching this in 2020
How are your videos so clear in just 480p ???
ROCKET LEAGUE

Why the fuck YouTube is suggesting me this video in 2020
Such a good good review. Comprehensive on experience. Thank you.
Superb review 👍
Who else got this in their recommended in 2020
Realize the mice&#39;s mouths in the tv where lighting up as Marques talks
Watching on my one plus 8 in 2020😂😂😂
Lol
Wait isn&#39;t oneplus 6=7
Most popular video of MKBHD

Nice
Why on my feed now?
Who still rocking the sweet 6 in 2020? <br><br>I&#39;m still just as in love with my Silk White 6 today as I was the day it arrived 2 years ago. It still feels super fast and good as ever. Even the screen hasn&#39;t burned in. My old 3T screen is a hot mess, but this one has held up real nice.
I don’t get it, you’re paying all this money for a 7?
Am I the only one having this suggestion coming in the home screen ?
And this is the starting of OnePlus becoming a flapship from a flagship killer.

RIP my OP6. Took one fatal drop at the perfect angle...had screen protector on and all but it still died.
I&#39;m so glad that I&#39;m watching this video on OnePlus 6

Didnt expect rl  to be in the video

Who&#39;s watching this when the OnePlus 8 is just $200 more than this
Well i did watch it 2 years ago but now it excites me watching it on One Plus 6.
21 millon people viewed. Imagine if 10% people bought it.
I’ve been using this for 2 years now and it’s still amazing.
Great phone,  using this in mid 2020 and it still runs smoothly like as the day one, great performance and speed even after 2 years
anyone here after seeing the 21M views?
I want to use this phone to play a 2nd account in Pokémon go
No sd card, small battery and poor camera. Much better phones in that price range
Is it still good for 2020? Thinking of buying a 2nd hand.
21 million views!
How did this get more views than a video with Elon Musk
Ngl I still want this phone
Ummm... Is he saying Android Pee instead of Pie?
Corona Virus exist<br>Marques ~ <br>SO I&#39;VE BEEN HAVING THIS VIRUS FROM PAST 2 MONTHS AND HERE ARE MY VIEWS
Why is this the most popular video on markqueses channel?
Still a beast
I spy rocket league 😳
Yup you were right. It still works dope
I didn&#39;t know marques plays rocket league
Honestly, the stats on this phone are not much better than my Nokia 6.1 Plus, which is less than one fifth of the price.
Now this phone supports HDR Video Plaback support
It was nice to watched
Equals 7
Back when OnePlus was flagship killer <br>Now it killed itself
Here watching it on my OP6 with Android 10 &amp; April security patch<br>Really really happy with the performance of the device even after 2 years 😍<br><br>BTW is anyone else also facing front camera problem with their OP 6.. Like totally loss of details?
Watching This on my OnePlus 6 , on26th May 2020 exactly after 2 years of video upload..
Worst phone ever purchased by me
I need that wallpaper
No entiendo nada pero me gusto
I have a question, what do you do with all devices after making videos, do you buy them or companies make you advertise there products???PLEASE ANS ME.
MKBHD most viewed video.
Watching this in 2020 is a little funny, considering they’re selling $900 phones. Good ones; but still $900.
Still using this phone and it&#39;s still a beast 2020
OMG 21 million views<br>wtf why not 21 million likes 👍
can we just appreciate his shirt
Why does it say 1 year ago. It is a video from 2018.
I&#39;m watching on a oneplus 6.
Pin me
Im watching this video because i know this phone created a revolution in whole mobile industry in 2018!
It&#39;s a great phone. I&#39;ve had it since july 2018 and everything has been great, consistent updates, great performance and so on. Only thing that failed is the headphone jack, it won&#39;t stay plugged and disconnects really easy (worked around it by using BT headphones) and the battery which is now below its optimum capacity, it does not last the whole day as it used to. But take in mind the phone has been used daily since then, it&#39;s only normal wear and tear.<br><br><br>On another note, I&#39;m dissapointed by this month&#39;s OP 8Pro launch, I was going to upgrade to it but it just does not cut it for me, too expensive and really no killer features.
it&#39;s crazy to think that Oneplus went from 529 to 900 dollars in just two generations
2020, still a great phone! Got the 8gb, 256gb version.
The battey life is soo bad
Now it’s 1000 bucks.
The fact, that this is the most popular Marque&#39;s video says something about this phone :) I&#39;ve got myself a used one in great condition for 270 € a year ago, best deal so far :D
now that the phone has been out for a good while can anyone tell me how durable it is in long term daily use?<br>i&#39;m heavily considering upgrading to this phone from my htc one m8 that i bought close to 3 years ago.<br>the only real doubts i have are over the lack of an IP rating as i&#39;m hoping this phone will last me another solid 3 years (preferably longer) and i have had some issues with a xperia z, which was supposed to be water proof, getting water damage from regular day to day use in the past.
As always presented with clear information.
Watching this video for the third time after<br>The launch of 7 series and 8seires
The last great OnePlus phone for price and performance. Kinda sad Oneplus have gone for full flagship phones now
Here after OnePlus committed suicide with those high prices with OP8.
Here we are with 8 series, you got your IP rating and your wireless charging, just that it starts at 900$ tag🙃
Youtube after OnePlus 8 (Pro) is announced...recommends MKBHD reviewing the OnePlus 6...seems legit. 🧐
Greetings from singapore, wow this phone looks awesome
the rise of MKBHD
Marques after 1 week of marriage:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>“So I’ve been trying this wife for a week now”
Phone that I want:<br>OnePlus 7T speed<br>S20 Ultra display<br>S20 Ultra camera<br>S10e bezels<br>iPhone 11 Pro processor<br>Huawei P40 Pro battery<br>Headphone jack
I wont buy anything from china. A trade war turned into a pandemic.
Big fan
I clicked this video just to say this is the last one plus mobile with headphone jack
which wallpaper is he using?
21m views most viewd video of mkbhd
Watching on my OnePlus 5t.
Damn it got 21M views!!
This is the most random video to have 21 million views lol
I see that the video was in your reccomend too
1.5 yrs Today and trust me it is as fast snappy and fuckin smoother than i bought it back then! I was previously an iphone user but trust me OnePlus is shatters iphone...I couldn&#39;t believe they provide me this much in jst 500 bucks and still regular updates faster than any 1000$ phones out there every month security updates my god why didn&#39;t i used OnePlus from the starting! iPhone looks shit in front of this! Fuckin overwhelmed!
If they&#39;re gonna increase the price again on the OnePlus 8 they better include an IP rating they&#39;re increasing they&#39;re prices every year
Watching in my op6 now 😅😅
<b>2020</b>
Is this his most viewed video?
Is this better then the galaxy note 9? Not a tech geek so im srry if it sounds like a dumb question
watching again in 2020 ! I don&#39;t know why i got it recommended
basically if you dont care ab slightly worse speakers and your not crazy ab taking pics all the time buy it.
Samsung&#39;s m series has these features at just around 150-250 dollars
who is in 2020?
ONE PLUS 6 is 7
The price cut strategy was followed much earlier by MI.
21 million views for a phones review is insane
Plz give me one phone and oneplus 5 give me plz 🙏
Bro iam big big fan of you
Why is this still in my recommended
My phone has wireless charging function and I never use it because.... why should I?

Oneplus makes midrange and flagship which i love! I love oneplus and im starting to like it more than nokia
Rl in the background
I am from 2023 <br>$900 is now considered budget
Didn&#39;t talked about performance lol
beyond 1080 is stupid when you&#39;re talking about a tiny phone screen
I&#39;m watching this on My One Plus 6😍
I got OnePlus 7 with just 420$ from India Oneplus showroom 😇
And now yesterday i have received android Q update after a years
<b>My favorite 1+ phone</b>
It’s interesting that this is his most popular YouTube video
Watching this again after I upgraded it to 7 Pro .
December 2019 see you again next year
oneplus quality is garbage. after only one year mine started getting hung up while booting and wont start. the repair center will only offer to sell me the op6t for 499 ya right, never settle!
Still can&#39;t believe how many views this video has got till now. Way to go Marques
It’s funny how oneplus made 2 important trends in smartphones.  Fast charging and high refresh rate
I don&#39;t get the Apple fanboys. They are blind af, they just buy overpriced shit that is behind their age and are the most expensive on the market. Wtf I doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. And if you dare to try and reason with them about the topic they just rage like a fuckin lunatic and end the friendship you once had with them before they got an iphone<br><br>Edit: macbooks are good, i am mainly talking about the phones and airpods<br><br>Edit 2: airpods are cool looking. i get why people buy them but they are overpriced altho by so little it doesn&#39;t bother me
I am seeing on op6
Who the heck uses the Paladan in rocket league? 😂
Anyone after 21M views?
Why does this video out of all oh his videos  IS THE MOST POPULAR?
And im here still using oneplus 6 instead everyone are going to use 7t pro.
I love his shirt in this vid
I understand where you&#39;re coming from in calling this a budget phone, but I spent $200 on my last phone, and ooph!&quot;
Still a better phone than pixel 4.
Why call it the One Plus 6 when that equal 7
Changed from pixel 3 to iPhone 8....last about a week. Now I have a OnePlus 6 and I love it! I&#39;d say it&#39;s better than the pixel 3. No wireless charging, not an issue. Especially with the dash charge feature.
Watching in my op6 now
I&#39;m just happy it has a headphone jack.  Just wish they put the fingerprint reader on the front.
Bagilah hp sebiji bang ☹️
Rip this phone By next year the 7 will probably go
Marques Brownlee can you please tell me name of the music you have used in the beginning of this video
anyone realize the rocket league in the tv at the back
Atleast it has headphone jackAnd home button
Anyone after 7t 🤣
here&#39;s your latest comment
Anyone from sep 2019??
OnePlus is China&#39;s Apple 🇨🇳😏
just a riview but hit 21m view wow
So in other words this phone is mid range ... Boooh and it&#39;s over $500 um no thanx
No SD Card expansion is bull...<br>It works for 6 hours of battery life? Come on... <br>I&#39;m more than half way thru this video and you haven&#39;t mentioned any ram yet, but I can guess it&#39;ll be 3gb. Anything 4 or less is sad.
One my way to buy ONEPLUS 7 for 660$ Australian dollars <br>I’m so happy I waited one year for better phone n cheap price <br>After 10 years with APPLE it’s time to move on 😉
Average person: pro camera quality in a phone!!<br>Photography: no no no
No way MKBHD plays rocket league 😂 What rank do you think he is lol
I am from 2019. 900$ is considered &quot;cheap&quot; now.
Still a great pick in Aug 2019 ?
whats the NAS model?
that explanation of the law of diminishing returns was terrible LOL

i been watch a lot of ur video. i love to have some of this cool!!! phone
do you recommend the oneplus 6 or the the oneplus 7?
Wallpaper ?
100k let’s go
Mark ass Brownie
NOTE 8 : 3300 mah battery is a small battery life<br><br>ONEPLUS 6 : it&#39;s 3300 mah battery is really good<br><br>Me :WTF
Its a beautiful phone
it’s kind of sad when a phones main feature is its price
Ye
Yes, right on the money. 600$ is half the price of a flagship these days, and there is a reason for that! I&#39;ve owned this phone and while it&#39;s good, it&#39;s also garbage. The screen randomly turns on, and since I have face unlock, it will randomly turn on and unlock... Multiple users have had this problem too and can&#39;t figure out why they have it. But don&#39;t worry, all one plus devices come with a good amount of similar problems that you have, but can&#39;t search up a solution to. It randomly reboots multiple times a day, and my phone is 1 year old. I owned the Oneplus 2 and it had the same little annoying problems just because.... Spend your money on a QUALITY flagship and you will understand what you&#39;re paying so much for.
watching on my OnePlus 6 🤗
great review bro
Install gcam and the whole camera game changes.......would probably be an A-
Thanks for the great review Marques!
Yhyh
OnePlus still uses this as an ad even after Oneplus 7 and 7 pro 😂
One plus never for me again...my one+6 died after water got inside...gone. i better pay more for samsung with water protection then taking this gamble. Never again...
Love your channel, keep up the great work
Lol your gestures on your oneplus is different from mine.
Most watched mkbhd video??😮
If i would buy a second hand one plus 6 now,how much should i pay if the phone condition is in good condition or from where i can buy a new op6?
where do you get cool wallpapers???
Where did you get the wallpaper for the OnePlus 6?
someone answer this question please!!!!... with this phone can you chop to get the flashlight and then also twist to get the camera or naw?
One plus 6 is 7
2014: iPhone 6 32GB - $299 (FLAGSHIP)<br>2018: OnePlus 6 A+ - $600 (BUDGET)
Hey does anybody know which wallpaper he&#39;s using?
A year old...I&#39;m looking for this in swappa a good deal hopefully I will get it
Can I get he wallpaper

Got it for 382€. Would have paid 100 less for the Poco but I just love the hardware so much on the OP6.
Watching this on my OP6 a year later
Shit man! I am so late, 21 Million before me!

Who notice the snake in the video
I will not give up my op6 until it disintegrates
We wud love to know what wud b your opinion if OnePlus 6 n S9 are of same price.... Kindly reply
Im using the oneplus x (its one of the older ones i know)  still holdin up
I love when nerds like this guy along with most &quot;tech&quot; reviewers nerds walk around and say all nerdy shit like, &quot; this is amazing phone because amazing specs,&quot; but when you actually go out and buy it and actually use it, it&#39;s literally a piece of shit phone that fails to do basic things. In conclusion, these nerds can talk about snapdragons and all other shitty nerd specs as much as they want, but at the end of the day, it is a shitty phone that fails basic task.
It&#39;s just incredible how many views the OnePlus generates.
My 150 dollar nokia X5 has wayy better battery than my brother&#39;s one plus 6T, my 50 dollar Gionee marathon m4 with a 5000mah battery has 3 time the battery life of the one plus, its over 17 hours of screen on time consistently after 3 years of use
500 dollar budget phone, thanks kanye very cool
oneplus died over a year ago.... their phones are now too expensive...
Nice
25 minutes for a full charge. I love this phone.

Wallpaper link please...<br>😊
Well.... It&#39;s pie not pee     don&#39;t mean any thing
If they put the wireless charging the price would go up alot
XIAOMI MI MIX 3 is best buy in this segment.  The Samsung Galaxy S9 is better phone and better priced.
Wallpaper?
no micro sd? whaa
Watching from 0p6
I just don&#39;t think any phone has surpassed iPhone in performance even if its a greta phone.
Guys who was focused on the guy in the back who was play rocket league and did not move the screen just afk like wtf play the game
The best flagship budget phone.insane phone with insane views of the video.

Marques Brownlees Intros ARE ALWAYS TOP NOTCH!
Better than 6t
20 millions views, the means 20 millions are using this phone probably 10  percentage are iPhone users are converting to OnePlus 6. Am watching this OnePlus 5
Wow 20M views congrats Marques!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I&#39;ll stick with my Note 9
I’m saving 240 NZ and getting the 6 over the 6t, yes I get 128gb instead of 256gb and SLIGHTLY smaller battery, but I keep headphone jack and can hold less music I don’t care.
That intro tune tho... dope!
That shirt though😂😂<br><br><br><br><br>Grey Duck 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
yeah for me wireless charging is not a big deal
This or s8? I’m having trouble choosing
MKBHD should do  a tutorial on how to get over 20M views on a video. 😵🤩
The one plus seven should be called the oneplus six
Good think
OMG 20 million views 🤑
I guess the 📸 camera gets better with software optimization.. And pixel n apple 🍏 do alot of research n dev for it
dual sim but no SD expansion? no thanks.
dude, someone has to tell u, your depth of field is TOO STRONG. its annoying, disorienting, unnatural, and it sucks. please tone it down a bit. come on.
oneplus service is so bad
never purchase oneplus phone
but one plus has the same price of s9 😕
please make video about this phone after android pie update!
Watching on my One plus 6, absolutely love it
Who don&#39;t like one plus 6 t 👎

Please clean the damn screen when you review phones. Please, I beg!
$500 $600 is what a flagship used to be either inflammation has gone out of control or we are getting screwed badly. I am considering buying this phone new for $450 dollars which I still think its a high price for an older model but not as bad as all the other crazy phones out there. You can get the note 8 for $550 and the s8+ for $450 new if someone is interested.
Just got my OnePlus 6<br>🤤<br>Smooth as butter

Thanks for a good  review.

YO WTF, in the background the dead mouse topper head and monstercat skin red and white on the octane is the exact same rocket league car is used for ages!!!!!!!!!
it doesnt have an sd card
Hey Marques, I just got a Oneplus 6 and ever since I did my update IG videos would start off clear but then go blurry after 2secs into it.  Have you experienced this at all or have you heard any similar complaints? Do you know any possible solutions for this at all?  I&#39;ve tried reaching out in the Oneplus community app but pple keep annoyingly saying it&#39;s my internet connection but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. I would love your opinion on this please!
Who is here after watching the Smartphone 2018 awards video? Re-watching the video and the last bits of the video pretty much tells you why the 6/6T won the smartphone 2018. It does everything well enough but most importantly it does everything well at its price point. Incredible value for the price. Hope we can see them do better. Who knows, maybe the headphone jack will come back...?
How to get wallpapers you use in OnePlus 6 &amp; 6t?
There&#39;s something up with the thumbnail 😂
Most people really don&#39;t mind not having wireless charging. Very minor thing... Most phones price people out of the market but these OnePlus phones are coming through
I think you missed the Front Camera, it takes really good Selfies i think. Switched from an S9 Plus to OP6 and don´t regret it.
I like this phone
Wallpaper link?
The only good thing about YT Rewind is me discovering this channel dayum
That editing though!
Holy 20 million views that&#39;s insane
Nice review 👍🇬🇧
Wireless charging provides very little utility and is inefficient from a physics standpoint compared to standard charging. It is a useless organ much like the appendix. However, the water resistance, battery life, and performance is something that is actually useful. I&#39;m glad that OnePlus is putting efforts to add some level of water resistance to it they are very good in terms of utility per dollar.
That phone has the BEST NOTCH!

iPhone 7 plus or Oneplus 6?

Glad and surprised that people like Chinese phones these years, but don&#39;t you guys have concerns about the security and privacy problems with Chinese brands? Just curious
@Marques  What would be your pick between the OnePlus 6t and the Pixel 3 xl?
Still cant afford this but still cool though.
Oneplus 6 will be Oneplus last Masterpiece.
Any OnePlus 6 users here?
Which battery is better s9+ or oneplus 6?
I&#39;ve a question and I hope, someone can help me (I&#39;m not from an english speaking country so I apologize for the mistakes).<br>The SAR value which is &quot;representive&quot; for phones is measured at the head right? So for people which doesn&#39;t make calls a lot (and if they do, they use headsets), isn&#39;t the SAR value measured on the body more important? Shouldn&#39;t you only worry about the that second SAR value if you are one of that kind of person?
We can offer one plus 6 original screen. If you need please contact me

Yesterday I got a second hand OnePlus 6 and I&#39;m so happy with it. Typing this on the phone now and everything is so silky smooooth. Luckily the guy before kept it in a case so there are no scratches or anything and he even threw in the case for free with it which is super. He got rid of it when he upgraded to the 6t so he&#39;s a true OnePlus fan but I like the headphone jack so the 6 is the one for me. Thanks for the great review!!
I ended up buying the OnePlus6 after this review. I was considering the poco f1, and I still think I should have gone with the f1. But the lack of nfc and the os pushed me over to the oneplus. Awesome review anyway
returned one plus 6t tmobile  after 2 days..screen colors not good..only a 1080p screen..screen and colors not even as good at my note 5..ending up getting a note 9
They fixed the gestures with update

@marques browniee I did see your videos in maybe 2 years, but now i have more time on my hands, I clicked on this video and immedeaty I can tell you have braces which you try to hide. But its all in the speech. Its obvious, don&#39;t ry to hide them. Embraces them.
Great review thanks so much, I&#39;m sold :)

OnePlus is slowly dropping from their previous god tier in the tech community. But it&#39;s still better than that fruit company for now
Please Help:<br><br><br>I read that there is a difference between the OnePlus A6000 model and the A6003 one..I live in the US right now, but will occasionaly go back to live in the Netherlands in EU..is there a difference between the models that i should take note of? Like would the A6000 not work in the Netherlands??
Can someone share me the link for that wallpaper 😍
Verry nice, needed a new phone and didn&#39;t want to spend above 650. Thanks for the review! It made the choice a solid one ;-)
Does the 402 ppi screen make videos on YouTube, Netflix, showbox ect look abit pixelated?
1+ has become the flagship that it promised to kill. RIP.....
Even better about this phone is how batteries work. If you let your phone die, then charge it, you get a longer battery life.
Thank you for this review
It is, if you buy me one. PS:get me 256GB version 🤤
I see Rocket League in the background fam 👀
How much
Hey guys, I don&#39;t usually comment on videos but I have a friend who is starting up a new youtube channel about tech-related stuff. It would totally make his day if you go subscribe, like, and comment on his videos @ Gizmo Ground. Thank you :)
Buying one this week
It only has 5 hours of battery. I have one the battery is not the best
Tbh, I&#39;d rather buy this phone than the 6T. I&#39;ve never been bothered by the notch, but I do need my headphone jack. Besides, $529 is a joke for an ultra powerful phone!
Best mobile till date ...used iPhone as well but I think one plus 6 is better then...all other with it&#39;s price
is that true when make a video with front camera it doesn&#39;t have audio?
Whaattttttttt 20 million ypu are singer oor tech reviewer 😱😱😱
This is his most popular upload, literally i have seen his video views average over 2.5 million views. This blows everything out of the water
I am the only one. Here who thinks op6 is better than op6t<br>-headphone jack<br>-the notch dosent matter<br>-same cam
As someone in landscaping/plant world, always appreciate them flower/shrub/tree photos!!
No SD slot is a deal breaker for me.
Rocket league!!
Really???? Poco F1 ads in 1+6T review in every channels 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it comparable with the 3 network? I want to buy it but I’m with the Three Network (as you can probably tell I know nothing about phones!)
Great review.  Good for tech-challenged me.
I&#39;m not that tech savy. What is dual sim for
I&#39;ll pick the 6 or by now 6T over any other &#39;flagship&#39; out there. Nothing more horrible than Samsung&#39;s or Huawei&#39;s software :D
I&#39;m really interested in getting the 6T. The review practically sold me, but I&#39;m worried about the camera because I take a lot of videos and pics. Now I&#39;ve heard good things about the camera, and have seen some example photos, but I want to know how does it compare (just the camera) to my current phone for 3 years now, the Nexus 6P. Can anyone offer an answer? The 6p camera has served me well for 3 years now and switching to a new phone, the camera will be the biggest thing for me...
How can i get it in France? <br>Tell me anyone please
cool phones but when they cost 100 to 200 dollars more than an s9+ my country, then I will be staying away from them
Wireless charging &gt; Quick Charging imo. It&#39;s super relaxing. Just place in on your desk wireless pad. Don&#39;t need to plug in and out all the time.
views speak volume of this phone... it&#39;s literally a flagship crasher
I&#39;m here watching this review waiting for tomorrow&#39;s 6T launch which will probably be the same but with smaller notch and in-screen fingerprint sensor.
Quick charging.. 2x Quicker draining..
is there has notification light?
Very exited for One plus 6t phone.
Wow..my favorites
Need that Wallpaper
Mkbhd pls give me the link for this wallpaper....😊
Not as good as a s7 edge in my opinion
I love how having a headphone jack is a positive point now
Damnnnnnn 20 million views,
If it had dual speakers I&#39;d buy it. I&#39;m partially def and need loud front facing speakers especially when watching video and playing games. I noticed it with the HTC One M8, then later on with the Pixel XL2. Having those dual front speakers is a must for me. I wish more phone companies would include dual speakers.
Anyone after 20M???
My mobile is oneplus 6
They need a CDMA version that works with Verizon. I have a 3T, great phone (ok camera) but stuck with AT&amp;T which doesn&#39;t come close to Verizon in coverage/signal strength. We&#39;re sadly going to have to switch back to VZW on our next phones and get stuck with limited options that we can pick from vs being able to get 2 phones for basically the price of one.
good phone
First time watching this channel, keep it up!
Huawei just took the crown of the fastest charging phone in the world(at least till the 6T comes out)
4 inch OnePlus phone<br><br>small screen lovers Hit Like
I have an S9 now and I miss my 3T dash charging 😢
love from the Philippines dude, but one dollar is equal to 50₱ here in the Philippines. so  and the redmi 4x is about 6,000₱ or 110$, I&#39;m a student with 1$ allowance everyday. I CAN&#39;T AFFORD THE REDMI 4X :&lt;
I can&#39;t even afford the xiaomi redmi 4x.
i still have my pixel waiting on the one plus 6t because i dont like what google has to offer this year. does this work with fi?
I have the 5T and love it, but my buddy&#39;s LG can charge faster than it. Dash is quick, but LG is quicker, in my experience at least.
It sounds great, but the speakers are kinda important to me. I have an LG G6 that have been working for me - do you think these speakers are at least on that same level?
I Think all the things missing is exactly the details I don’t really care about in a phone. Wireless charging, micro sd, stereo speakers, I can live a really don’t care
I currently have a Moto g5 rn and was considering upgrading the the one+6. Is it a good upgrade? Is the one+ screen quality good, camera and does it feel sluggish at all with the oxygen OS. can someone please help
With that shirt you can only be from one place... Minnesota the only state that uses grey duck!
OnePlus 6 Vs Samsung Galaxy S8 ... Which one is better to buy right now in 2018 ????
LG V35 &gt;1+6
Can someone tell me why android is copying the notch? As far as I know, iPhone does it for Face ID reasons.
I&#39;m mainly curious how the camera compares to the flagships of previous years? Is the camera as good as say Sansung Galaxy S7, iPhone 7 or 8?
Most viewed video of mkbhd!
Oneplus 6 or Samsung S9+?
Honestly fuck wireless charging. It was cool in 2013 when the Droid Maxx had it, but it&#39;s worthless and new phones shouldn&#39;t have it. I&#39;m not happy that Apple brought it back. Why does my Pixel 3 have to have it?
bought the pearl version, this phone really doesnt seem like a low end flagship. There are a couple of tiny bugs like the screen rotation doesnt recognize ive flipped the phone in certain apps, but thats as bad as it gets. I think most people are happy with this phone for the price then shelling out 900 for a pixel or iphone. In the future we will see the consumer set the price of smartphones at around 700 for a flagship. Nobody will be willing to pay 900 again for a phone unless your an iphone person and not all that smart.
This thing is capable of recording 4K at 60 fps with very impressive video quality and OIS. For just $600..
Wireless charging won&#39;t be a deal-breaker for me until more American furniture manufacturers start putting wireless charging build into desks, and couches, and tables. Like they do at IKEA in Sweden.
I&#39;m looking forward to the price going down on the 256gb version once the 6T is released....
I have a OnePlus 3. I just noticed that the Network, Battery and Clock icons on the top of the screen are visible like a light grey shade through the display when I was watching videos on YouTube. I checked it by looking at different photos as well. The icons are visible through photos as well.
please make a review to xiaomi mi 8
does oneplus phones let me deside what apps i want installed? and does phone push commercial messages out like samsung and sony?
Moved to iphone 7plus to op6 and im mindblown with all the features and flexibility
you have said more than a 100 time of (it is better than any 500-600$ smartphone )
Honor 10 &gt; is about €20+ cheaper then Mate 10 Pro &gt; is €100 cheaper then OnePlus 6. Which one should i get? O.o
I just got the Silk White version! An amazing upgrade from HTC One M9
Bought the Xiamoi mix mi 2s instead of the OnePlus 6 because of the notch, I hate the notch when watching YouTube and Netflix
This is the best daily mobile phone anyone could get now in my opinion, of course taking into account its price.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PrUr3bQdwM&amp;t=268">4:28</a>. What do you mean “if I don’t use it that much”. If that’s the case WHY USE IT AT ALL.
Great review
Dat wallpaper
I got a OnePlus 6 yesterday and I don&#39;t regret it
20 mil views and counting.  Damn
That Plus from marques is just WOW 😍
Hi, Does it support Call recording ?
Wallpaper link ?.
I just worry about how secure Android phones are.
Every time I watch this video I always think why do you want it wireless charging? You can&#39;t use it when it is charging... also you have to place it down on a wireless charging pad for it to charge...
Cool.
Hey you can buy 2 of this instead of 1 phone that doesn&#39;t have jack 😀
After seeing this vid, I feel like I overpaid by almost $1k for my Xs, but at least I’m buying American =)
my next phone, google&#39;s pixels are expensive disappointment
Hit like if you watching this on OnePlus 6
first in line is a bad way to explain android update roll outs, most non flagships will never get the current android software. my lg v20 never got an update when i had it and never will. that&#39;s no line
Just waiting for tmobile to sell it. Supposedly exclusive retailer for one plus 6t. Worthy of making a vid on that topic? Will that bring the phone to waaay more ppl making one plus a bigger contender against apple and Samsung?
That&#39;s one real deal Honest; Fully Honest Review! Thanx.
Sucks that they ditched the headphone jack for the 6T
Marques Brownlee  will you please compare the new OnePlus6T over this?  Please
wow😮😮😮

I currently own an iPhone 7 Plus and I’m looking for a new phone. Will the Oneplus 6 be a nice upgrade from the iPhone 7 Plus? Or might it be better to wait for the 6T?
What did a Youtube phone reviewer say to a hot girl on a blind date: &quot;You look so... premium.&quot;
I really want that phone, but with missing water ressistant it pushed me WAY to back, the LG G7 is veru identical, y just want that phone cause its so pretty, so lg g7 is identical and it has water ressistance. And has way better speakers
How is it called that wallpaper?
Im an Iphone user..<br>Quick charging is what we need...<br>Wireless charging is what we show off..<br>So necessities over power the “flaunt it” thing.
who else thought watching marques&#39; videos are cringy
Really fast 💨
really bang for the BUCK. hearrd every1 in USA has it? is it true? ;3 From Yan Nerng
I been with onepmus for 3 years. And I&#39;m super happy
What’s your rank on RL lol
Watching  on my one plus 6😍😍😍😍
Equals to seven
How long you used this phone and did you facing some issues ?
@marques - I really like your reviews. Good job man.
Great review.
I bet most of the viewers are Indian students lol
This or S8+?
I absolutely would have purchased this phone, if it were compatible with Verizon here in the States.<br>EDIT: Never mind, it doesn&#39;t have expandable storage. That&#39;s a dealbreaker for me.
I like it
S8 or oneplus6?<br>Both on same price
No SD card is a bumper....
We are getting Samsung s8 and one plus6 at same price on Flipkart and Amazon in their Diwali sale in India..Which of the two is a better buy according to you ?
Is this a good device to swap from a note 8? Thanks
I will sell my 7plus for this. Seriously
S8 or OP6 🤔
Nokia 7.1 review
now it can avail at 365$ here in india on Amazon.....

Rocket league squad were ya at
The photos look amazing.
Seems like he really likes the phone.. look at the expressions and his voice while he&#39;s talking about the phone.. If he&#39;s impressed I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the best one!
Phone of the year?<br>I am rooting for this

All I want to know, why don&#39;t you have more subscribers, your video editing is amazing your presentation is really well done it looks very good, professional and clean, more so than other Tech YouTubers how and why do you not have more subscribers?
Anybody has got link to the Wallpaper????

I think you&#39;re cutting oneplus a lot of slack here,the lg g7 thinq is around the same price as the higher tiered oneplus 6 (8 gb ram ), but the g7 has<br>1) Water resistance (IP 68)<br>2)Wireless charging<br>3)High fi Quad DAC<br>Basically flagship features that oneplus does not provide,<br>With oneplus continually incrementing the price, I would kind of expect oneplus to eventually add these features.
Pocophone Android p this month
Oh crap now I want a OnePlus phone
Bro, I love your videos soooo much. So professional. &lt;3 LOVE IT.
You know what I love about iPhones?......<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>That I have my OnePlus 6 😆
Go with this if you want a headphone jack, the 6T won&#39;t have one unfortunately.
Where can I buy this phone
That&#39;s not an S, That&#39;s hope
I&#39;m not sure if I missed it but I don&#39;t see you reviewing sony phones?
6T* on the way
Why does this video have 20 MILLION views?
I&#39;m sorry no expandable storage is not a cut on cost by any means whatsoever, it&#39;s just to promote selling the version with bigger storage that&#39;s all, no excuses there let&#39;s be real honest.<br>Also budget phones are up to max 300-350$, anything above that is considered midrange, again we gotta be real honest.
Oh look a lg g7 ThinkQ but gayer!
How does removing expandable storage save mone
Only one small critic about about your review in the end: You said a lot of times, way too many times to be honest, that it definitely beats every other phone at the price range of 500-600. We get it :) It&#39;s a great phone and it&#39;s definitely better than earlier flagships of OP, like e.g. the OP3. I think I&#39;m gonna buy it :) It seems like the perfect phone for me 😄
Ambient display mode? What exactly would do it if you raise your phone? Turn the display on? :)
Originally when I clicked on thisvideo I thought you would say that it&#39;s a little bit too pricy for its features and no the opposite is the case. It&#39;a great smartphone and you&#39;re just proving that further and further with this video alone :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PrUr3bQdwM&amp;t=263">4:23</a> Not quite. There are two versions: theversion with 64 gigs of storage has &quot;only&quot; 6 gigs of RAM. The version with 128 gigs has 8 gigs :) Just to add that, not that people will get confused :) and to let you know if you didn&#39;t know before and not just forgot to mention it in the video :)
I&#39;m only at the third minute and this review is going good. So props to you: Good review. And yeah... About the not expandable memory: I don&#39;t get why they don&#39;t do it. I mean... It&#39;s in other this price category phones that you at least can either have two sims or one sim and one micro sd card in the phone.<br><br>But I&#39;ll wait for the 128 GB version of the phone anyway and even 64 gb are much memory. So with 128 gigs I shouldn&#39;t have a problem with the not expandable memory. I&#39;m in total a big fan of OnePlus. It makes a good job in phones in general. Especially with the gestures. I absolutely adore them xD :) But seriously... They&#39;re really great. Thumbs up for OP, and for you ;)

What wallpaper is it ?
I am watching on my OP6.
This is a monster of a phone
Got mad problems after Android 9.0 .... U can&#39;t use internet on your phone and on YouTube you get a white stripe in landscape so have to remove notch
20mil wow
I’m fine with my iPhone X
I reached 9 h 20 m battery life with dark theme and wifi only
Should I buy the op6 or wait for 6T? My current mobile is driving me nuts...please suggest me one
If it had better speakers i would buy it
Just need a Public opinion, Should i go for Oneplus 6 or wait for 6T ?
I can&#39;t talk to(they can&#39;t hear my voice)  my teammates in PUBG MOBILE while screen recording! Please help me! How can I fix this?
How do you use a phone that&#39;s not available in your service provider?
Unpopular opinion: wireless charging is pointless.
Can I have a link to the wallpaper?
I had the oneplus 1 and 2 and I decided to not buy oneplus anymore. The software updates are not coming after 2 years. The Samsung galaxy s4 I had which was at least a year older still got updates but the oneplus didn&#39;t.<br>Second is sound quality of music using head phones. You can bring oneplus devices up to Samsung or HTC level but it&#39;s not easy especially if you don&#39;t really have an idea how to put your settings and which software to use. It&#39;s a bit flimsy.<br>Third is the size. For me, I don&#39;t like the big devices. Nowadays devices all have the issue that they are just too big for me and if I want smaller, I don&#39;t want to miss on power or (and this is why I won&#39;t buy Sony) design. You can make it deeper to put more Batterie, no issue for me but it still doesn&#39;t have to look like a square.<br>Four is the price. Yes they are cheap but I feel like every time they bring out a new phone their price gets a bit closer to all those flagships they once wanted to kill. They started with 300-400 and are now by nearly 600. I feel like they are testing how much money they can get out of consumers without being put on the same level as all the Samsungs and apples out there and I hate it.
Can&#39;t wait for one plus 6 t on t mobile. 🔥🔥
&quot;It has a headphone jack&quot; lol it&#39;s something surprising in 2018
What do you guys think about the fact that they plan to remove the headphone jack in the 6t
I wish it had expandable storage...
Great OnePlus 6 review
Fuck
Do you personally like OnePlus 6 over LG G7 ThinQ?
Bro which one u prefer oneplus 6 or s9 plus for non gaming user and dont care about the budget..?
The fastest Android Phone !!!
Comment here if you’re alive.
i wouldn&#39;t mind paying an extra 100$ for a better camera tho. one on par with atleast the pixel 2
20mil views!!!!!
One plus 6 have a telephoto lens dude.... What the hell???
great. yall sold me on this
If the rumours are true about the OnePlus 6T having wireless charging, I just hope it&#39;s just as fast, if not faster and keeps the price relatively similar. Even if wireless charging isn&#39;t as fast I hope standard charging is just as fast as it is on the 6 and if they can push battery life even further then great. Also I hope the speakers are better. If so then I will 100% buy it.
The wallpaper link please🙏
Waiting for the 6T, but really miffed with reports of NO Headphone Jack!
I cant believe im saying this but i feel like selling my s9 and buying one plus 6
do we need to buy the charger seperately? or paying 579 is included with the charger?
Any suggestion Where I can get Dash Power Bank for One Plus 6??
Wh....why 20m views??
How much they paying u haha
Waiting for OnePlus 6T
Wish they would make another one plus x hard to find a good phone with screen smaller than 5.5 inch
Where can i get the wallpaper

Is it useful for you
i wish they could had make sd card slot on 1plus 6.

this is the most watched video on the channel<br>lmao
OnePlus 6 is 7 <b>quick math</b>
Bought it and love it, very fast, no trashware unlike almost every other brand of android phones im loving oxygenOS, good price, awesome internal specs, great build, 3.5 jack, super fast charging, no crap like wireless charging that bumps up the price and ends up never used, speaker is dinky but agai i almost exclusively use earphones so good speakers would be another price bump that would end up never used for me, exelent phone, especially for the price, recomend 100%.
Need to bring back the dual speakers with JBL.
Then pocophone f1 comes....
As always, great review. I&#39;d love to see One Plus 6 vs Pocophone F1.
Notches are aids
Watching this on a Poco F1, the phone is worth the price. Good camera, gaming performance, battery.
I reeeeeally don&#39;t understand the hype of wireless charging.
I want this wallpaper. Help
Highest Ever Views on this Channel 😲! OnePlus should seriously consider MKBHD as their brand ambassador 🤔😎...
Just gimme the Oneplus 6T
Apple should learn from OnePlus
Can one plus give wireless charging or not
Weird not finding any comment asking for the wallpaper
Hey, what is your opinion about Redmi poco F1?

In my country this phone is now at it&#39;s lowest which is 730$.. That&#39;s just ridicilous<br>Btw: No.. average salary is nowhere near to high..Czech republic folks, Czech republic :-/

how is the zenfone 5z? Is it best under 30k in india?
What calendar widget??
What is your name mental?
Wow. A lot of the views!!!!!!
all i want to run is whats app and facebook .... i guess any phone made over the last 4 years would be great
It would be really cool if you could scroll using the fingerprint reader
Can you hide those bottom buttons on OP6. For an example while scrolling instagram or facebook?
Which is better iPhone 8 plus or one plus 6?
Atleast it has headphone jack<br><br><br><br>And home button
You lost me at no microSD card..
When will you do the 6t?
Big ups on your 20 Million Views. This has to be your most viewed video to date.
Wallpaper?
i need tht one
Yet if you have an iphone 6s plus that now costs 200$ you still look like you have a more expensive phone than that , i wouldnt of been able to tell that phone from a cheap one they sell at metro pcs
I am watching this on my 1plus 2
I would have never thought $500 would be a budget phone lol
Have you reviewed the Nokia X6?
It costs 519EUR, for 100EUR more i can get an S9 lol
What are the differences between oneplus 6 global version and Chinese version???
Too bad for bad speakers.
if they manage to build a QHD+ resolution display in the 6t I will definitely buy it.<br>But 1080p in 2018 is just too low...
I will be back to OnePlus the day they add expandable storage tbh.
It&#39;s hard to choose a Good phone for a daily driver. I Personally like the Essential phone for the stock android, but One Plus 6 and the ASUS ZenFone 5Z are two i really like. The Honor view 10 and the Huawei Mate 10 pro are on my list too.
oneplus used to be the budget friendly flagship killer but now its not, if you go for 128gb model which most people will go for it will cost you 580$ you can spend a 100 more and get the flagships. it has lost its appeal. when it was 400 and flagships were 600-700 it was a good choice , but when its 600 and flagships are 700 its not worth it.
make video on poco f1
should a change my pixel xl 2 for this phone? help !
Personally I would prefer expandable storage than wireless charging, i don&#39;t find myself using it. Idk what purpose it serves other than not having cable
i&#39;m really scared to switch from apple to android .. when i&#39;ll broke my iPhone SE (or when apple will update it to death) i&#39;m considering buying a phone like this. considering i was accustomed to 64gb paying the same price, the only thing i ll miss are the speakers. the thing that is really holding me back is that i don&#39;t have non-apple computers
seriously!!!!!!<br>20 million views????????<br>ohhh Marques u r the best
..will next radio work on it since its a snap dragon? .. I really want an fm radio without using data... Thanks to who will reply...
Damn was almost sold but the no expandable storage killed it for me.
Hey man.  Thanks for another great vid.  Please put more emphasis on video quality for these phones.  It&#39;s always photo.
OnePlus 6 or S8 Plus?
&quot;not ip67 rate&quot; yeah my one plus 3 survived a washing machine for an hour and it&#39;s still working like brand new.... So don&#39;t let that discourage you from buying the phone. (oh and it fell from a full speed motorcycle and it survived)
Problem with these budget smartphones is that were I live they&#39;re often almost as expensive at the flagships. The OnePlus 6 is $700 over here. Not worth it.
I want to buy the OnePlus 6 but i live in Australia and i don&#39;t know which suppliers/sellers to trust. Do you have any recommendations? Also, if i buy it on the official OnePlus US website will i still get updates as quick as other OnePlus phones? and yes i do realise that i won&#39;t get the warranty, but do you think i really need a warranty with this phone?
I would TOTALLY buy this phone...BUT WHY DOESN&#39;T IT RUN ON VERIZON?!!! <br>It has the tight processor, ram, and simple android without the bloatware...decent enough camera....all for a great price. But that&#39;s useless to me being a Verizon user and lover. What the hell gives?
20M views wow!
Marques, do you suggest this over the Xiaomi Mi 8? I&#39;ve been waiting for the Pixel 3 for about a year but it seems like it will be underwhelming. I&#39;m considering those options over it. What do you think?
19 million views ohh marqos you are best you tuber in the world
Lost me at no expandable storage :(
Lol y I&#39;m always watching all these reviews when I know I can&#39;t purchase one 😅
Do you get paid for defending oneplus<br><br>Sorry if im wrong just a random comment. Keep scrolling
You forgot to mention the device is only USB 2.0. However does this really make a difference?
Good Review
The only reason the price is cheap is because one+ is not a powerhouse company but fairly new in the tech industry. If they charged a big price and people didn&#39;t buy their products, they would lose significantly.<br><br>I would recommend companies with solid smartphone and trusted reviews, such as Nokia or LG. That&#39;s my 2 cents anyways, 😙
Note 9 all the way
Men from where did u get this wallpaper !!!!
Still waiting for your review of Huawei Nova 3i
Hey man , just got the red colour one. It is lookin&#39; fuckin&#39; precious. Those cool and noticable snappy animations😍😍😍. OnePlus&#39;s oxygen os is just just awesome. I feel massive upgrade from huawei gr5. Guys if u have money then spend it on oneplus. Just try it, u will be loving it. I am getting software updates weekly. That&#39;s insane. Proud to be associated with oneplus
Most people don&#39;t buy budget or &#39;good enough&#39;, they intentionally buy the best
What&#39;s one plus 6
Can you do review on asus zenfone 5z?<br>Any suggestions, Zenfone 5z vs Oneplus 6, which should I buy?
That intro tho
Hi Guys I have an iPhone 5SE and I am going to switch to the OnePlus 6 soon. I am sure it will be a bit traumatic ..... never used an android phone before but I am a bit sick of apple in general. My only concern is the camera ....would I will see an improvement or not.?  PS: I don&#39;t think I will be able to do some testing before the purchase. Thanks
Waiting for 20M..?
I need a headphone jack, front facing speakers and a decent camera is that too much to ask for?

I just got my OnePlus 6 today. I haven&#39;t put it down since then. (Coming from the Honor 7X)
Great phone but i just cannot move from the apple eco system.
If the fingerprint sensor is not under the display, I ain&#39;t gonna buy it!!!
The review of the phone he uses as a daily driver is his most viewed video. Fitting.
Whats the most watched video in MKBHD?
i get so crazy when they cant put 2 good speakers in phones. i mean how much could they really be? No space? Whats the deal?
Does Indian one plus6 works in UK? I heard that there are some hardware changes and does not match with the network. Is that true?
The pocophone f1 just fucked this one hahah...300 baby with all the specs
Considering buying this phone. Amazing review, love your videos man.
i wish oneplus would make a compact phone
I&#39;d get it if it wasn&#39;t for speakers being weak. That&#39;s the deal breaker.
I&#39;m desperately wanting to change to the OP6 as my G6 is lagging badly. Or should I wait for the PocoPhone or OP6T? <br>Also, in Singapore, I can get an S9 for the price of a OP6 base model. But I&#39;d like to experience the &#39;speed of OnePlus&#39;. Would it be worth it? Thanks!
Looks like a 2014 phone.
Man I like this guy :D
link to wallpaper
Please give a oneplus 6...
Basically the OnePlus 6 is so good for its price that it ends up being compared to phone $200 to $500 more expensive than it
Which wallpaper is this give me name of it
On your description iPhone 10 is that original or clone and if I order it did I get it
best reviewer ever !
Please review pocophone f1
1+6=7
How does OnePlus 6 compares to Honor 10? that also looks like really good deal.
Hype Hype Hype.    When the One plus 7 comes out by Christmas what then.  SUre Apple does the same..but a mush better quality product and SECURE OS.
I’m looking to swap from iPhone to android as some my friends have and recommend... which do you rate for some one switching.. I’ve watched you vidz and I like the look of the pixel 2xl, p20 pro, galaxy s9, razor and one plus 6 but I need alittle advice.. maybe your top 3, I have iPhone 7 Plus at the moment camera good and runs ok so want similar or better <br>Thanks keep the videos coming 👍🏻
mr brownlee, can have 1 of your one plus?
Marques if OP6 and P20pro were at the same price range which one would you choose?
Seems he paid by one plus

I&#39;m buying this in 2 weeks
Got butt fucked by POCOPHONE
Thanks to your review I buyed one plus
How cheap can we make one plus <br>Really they just increase the price from it predecessor.<br>They are not making it cheap there make it look premium. All they are trying to do is imitate apple. They will make it more expensive in future.<br>The only company that is doing what u said is xiaomi.
why people need wireless charging? you can move your phone around while it&#39;s hooked on the cable, but with wireless charging you have to keep it on the charger constantly. i don&#39;t see the point. <br>Cable charging is much more convenient.
OP is the only smartphone company that focus only on a single flagship
Why people are so excited about &quot;clean android&quot;? the design is not good, no nice apps like integrated call recorder and any thing else you have to download, some to watch advertise...
Any chance you can assist me get one of these in Zimbabwe?
im still using the op3t and it still works great, but i&#39;d definetly consider buying this one when i need a new one. <br>I love how long Oneplus provides updates for their phones :)
thats high end enough to me
Maybe the should make one low price model and one high in model.
this or s8?

You got the definition of &quot;law of diminishing returns&quot; wrong. What you wrote in the video was the point of &quot;negative returns&quot;.
Such... crisspines... Such quality! Beautiful... <b>Tears roll down</b>
This is probably going to be the most watched phone review video on YouTube?
If they fix the camera im in . just give us the note 4 camera and its a instant winner
Why does the thumbnail have a bigger chin than in real life?
Well in my country the oneplus 6 costs the same as s9+ note 8 etc...so
♥️♥️♥️
Fuck deadmouse in the background!
Not a fan of wireless charging. Rather keep a case on my phone. But can&#39;t afford to pay 529 bucks on a phone with no insurance on it. I crack my screens at least once a year. This year it was twice. And the backs get cracked quickly with just 1 drop. If the moto z dropped with snapdragon 845 I would&#39;ve gotten it
if apple decides to price their phones 30% lower,  one plus dies, all Android phones dies.
The only reason why I haven’t gotten this phone yet is because it doesn’t have stereo speakers otherwise it’d be golden
