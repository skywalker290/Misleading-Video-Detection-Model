😢
When I heard “ I’m Iron Man” last time. I keep telling people they should move on… Some do but not me
I don&#39;t think I even bothered with a trailer for this movie. Now that I&#39;ve seen it all I&#39;ve got to say is, that ending didn&#39;t age well.
Still get goosebumps seeing this
I get emotional watching this still.
omg the nostalgia of watching this trailer over and over, getting hyped for this film, i miss the hype
Till date I&#39;ll never forget the hype and the final battle...I don&#39;t think any marvel movie will top this 😍
Love this movie 3000.
5 years later, i still get goosebumps watching this trailer. Talk about perfect casting.
the perfect trailer doesnt exs-
The first 23 MCU movies (collectively as the Infinity Saga) was truly a once in a lifetime cinematic experience. Concluded by a brilliant finale.
Who come 2024,,📍
This movie became  part of our lives. The endgame trailer lives rent free in my head
Can&#39;t believe its been almost five years since endgame
Anyone in 2024 😂😂😂
This is the best Marvel movie in my opinion. It just ages like fine wine whenever watching it. The emotional weight, the payoff, the nostalgia, the finale, the taking of risks, and the humanizing of the OG characters were wonderful. I stg, whenever watching this, I feel like “no wonder Marvel never got any better than this…”. And Iron Man also proved that he is the best MCU character that no one can replace him. He was willing to sacrifice himself to save everyone. <br><br>Marvel can never be able to replicate its impact. Love it 3000<br><br>Although Avengers 5 and Secret Wars are promising, I feel like they won’t be able to live up to this masterpiece because the impact, as I’ve said before, is gonna be impossible to replicate and it and infinity war were the first of their kind.
Still watching in March 2024❤❤❤
Still watching this in 2024 lol peak MCU. Hoping Deadpool &amp; Wolverine bring us back to the glory days!
Whatever it takes
I can’t believe it’s been almost 5 years, I wish I could relive the hype for this movie again
Who misses Our greatest superhero iron man aka Tony stark
Thanos :- fail <br>Covid :- hold my beer 🍺
Who is here in 2024?

Who&#39;s watching this masterpiece in 2024 👇👇👇
Zelenskiy on the Top.
Code: Hawkeye.
The part where Thor is holding storm breaker and I guess is charging up something . Is that a deleted scene? I also loved when he said “I saw all these people die” it still gives me chills

Never seen this movie because the epicness of movies has gotten to the point that it is depressing and sucks the enjoyment out of the movie. Why is it black and white? Is the purposeful color problem sprinkled throughout the whole movie or is confined to one particular part that can be skipped?
This still gives me shivers. Nothing in CBM will ever match this.
5 years later , still a masterpiece
Me in 2019:😮<br>Me in 2024:😮<br>Nothing changes for Avengers....<br>  \__/<br>  (•_•)<br>  /&gt;❤
Watching in 2024 again
We&#39;re coming up on 5 years since this epic opening trailer debuted. Think about all that has happened since then all around us and all around the MCU. The title was speculated for months but it was the sheer validation of everyone who correctly predicted Endgame and the eruption reactions will never grow old. Excelsior!!
❤speechless
I watched this in the third day it came out in cinemas every seat was filled with people in my opinion 4th best movie oat because of the hype and the goosebumps
This movie is my childhood.
You know what is the craziest thing? that we are 5 years away from this movie turning 10 years since it came out and only 4 years until it turns 20 years since Ironman
one of the peaks of my life
I really really wanna go back to when the hype for this was insane
Still watching in 2024?
There will never be another moment like this.
Still waiting for a new avengers movie?
India Wale like koro
It’s a bummer we won’t get another Marvel movie like this again on the bright side the good mcu films we had was<br>Spider man no way home <br>Shang chi legend of the ten rings<br>Black panther wakanda forever .
It was so epic
I remember the hype around this movie so well, can’t believe it was 5 years ago
I had to ask when Falcon dies because he is black and the color of the trailer doesn&#39;t help.
157M views!!!! Wow
2024 and I&#39;m still watching this trailer just for the nostalgia
2024 comment here
I&#39;m back here with my eyes full of joy drops 😢

Who’s watching this in February, 2024?
Got this trailer recommended 😢
It feels weird but the MCU used to be pretty great. A shame that they are now tarnishing their legacy.
GTA VI gonna relieve the times before covid
The world has changed💔💔💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😭😭
Waste movie
It&#39;s creepy how this movie came out Right before the pandemic. It seems weird the parallel the similarities between covid 19 and that&#39;s snap do similar.
It feels like yesterday when I watched it for the first time😢
IW and endgame was good but after all of those heroes deaths it was not worth it😢
Absolutely crazy to think its 1 month today till its been 5 years since we had this trailer to one of the best Saga&#39;s ending
Comback in 2024 ❤❤❤❤
One of most legendary trailers of all time.
I miss the MCU. THE REAL MCU.
Who else watching this masterpiece trailer in 2024??
This is were the MCU should have ended...
Background music still hits hard...❤
I can’t believe Endgame only came out 40 years ago
2019 is the best year of my life, Deadpool 3 is coming, but this movie is still good ❤️
I miss tony so much
This really was the Endgame… for Marvel.
I still came here 😞
We want re release
Tony 😢
The new Marvel Movies don’t have the same hype anymore as these beautiful films made by The Legendary Russo Brothers 🔥🔥🔥
After 5 years it still gives goosebumps
The pause of dialogue before Tony says “whatever it takes” breaks my heart 😭
Remember when we had Cap and Iron Man…well now we have the Marvels🤦🏽‍♂️
Watching this in 2024 and still I got goosebumps
Still watching it❤
“The world has changed, there’s no going back”<br>That’s exactly how I think of this franchise after look back at these beautiful memories
ironman umarł jak coś
Exodus 20:7<br>You shall not invoke the name of the LORD, your God, in vain
Ephesians 4:29 <br>No foul language should come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for needed edification, that it may impart grace to those who hear.
Amazing
People tell me I should move on from the past phases of the mcu some do but not us
watched this after such a long time<br>I have goosebumps
Interessante quando ele estica o braço e o martelo vem
I will never move on 😭
Best thing marvel can do rn is just Reboot the franchise
Who still here to rewatch again the trailer in 2024❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=109">1:49</a> goosebumps
Lord please release me from my burden of ever having to see ...another Marvel movie in my lifetime..Amen.
2019
Hey Maggie i love
What a brilliant trailer, this still excites me so much, its such a shame that after the brilliance of Avengers : Endgame  there has been so many Marvel movies that have been complete crap!
I can&#39;t believe this trailer came out in 2019 time really flies
Ever since the premiere, this has been my all time favorite movie. Not just from marvel, but in general.
I watch this trailer to motivate myself. &quot;Whatever it takes&quot; to achieve my goals...
Так приятно снова пересмотреть трейлер этого шедевра
Who is watching this in 2024
i come here to try and feel the first time i saw this
Rewarching these trailers has me more hyped for Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars
After almost five years it&#39;s still really impresive how they made the trailers super fague to not give up the plot
they had hinted some things in the trailer and we completely missed them<br><br>in the beginning of trailer - <br>Tony: I was really hoping to pull of one last surprise<br>and when he tries in the final battle, he couldn&#39;t<br><br>Peggy to Steve: None of us can go back<br>and guess who goes back
I am watching this trailer in 2024
I love you 3000❤😢
They put Mjolnir in place of Stormbreaker in this trailer.
Now imagine what the epic will be like in Avengers: Secret Wars
또보러 왔습니다 갓아여..
Sometimes I reckon back to this, not to mourn what has now been destroyed, but to be happy that it once existed
Watching this trailer in 2024 and it still makes me so hyped
2024 and still watching this epic trailer
You just had to be there
I miss these days .....
The world has changed and none of us can go back. This hits hard after covid 😢😢
They don&#39;t make them like they used to
The conversation between Tony and Cap gives goosebumps till now ❤🎉
It’s breathtaking to watch these two miracle movies. You cant help but cry and the most unexpected and emotional moments. If only Marvel could start doing movies like these again.
2024 ❤
If this movie was a kid they would be in 1st grade 😢where in 2024 guys I feel old
Good old days
Missing old Marvel phase💔

And there were no more movies after this and everyone lived happilly ever after. Except maybe GOTG3 and Spiderman. The end.
I miss the 2019
marvel needs to come back to their roots/prime
When I first saw this trailer, I would pay whatever it cost for a time machine, just to re-live my reaction when i first seen this!
já se passaram 5 anos mas isso ainda enche meu coração de emoção
And ever since this film premiered,the MCU has never been the same 😢😢 bring back iron man

جميل
It&#39;s 2024 and nothing still beats the hype before this movie. <br>Peak Cinema
2024?
When life was good..
Good trailer but bad movie.
bro im just watching it randomly the chills im getting is insane no other movie will ever come close mark my words
goosebumps
and ofc i see this in 2024
i wish we could go back to the good old times, but it&#39;s impossible. the best we can do is to start over and hope they pull off one last one and get to our hearts again
The best trailer and movie ever, tears go down as I watch it again, Jan 10 2024
I wish this movie could&#39;ve came out three years after infinity war that way it&#39;ll be actual stakes on the line and that they know they would have to be very careful when time traveling because certain parts of the world are still on lockdown
the is a great movie till the end battle... when Cap Marvel just fly&#39;s in and basically single handily destroys Thanos&#39;s team in a few minutes.
What’s the trailer music?
I watched this movie 1000 time<br>A masterpiece ✨
&quot;Tony stark : It seems like a thousand years ago.&quot; This line has huge goosebumps in the starting of the trailer with the tune.
The best trailer of the century.
It&#39;s almost the 5th anniversary of this masterpiece
What a tine to be a movie fan..
So I want to buy this movie in YouTube or Google Play... but it&#39;s not possible until Jan 17th 2024?
❤
The hype was real ,the expectation stands on hope ,Marvel is love... Thank you Endgame ❣️
You had to be there
2k24 attendance.....
Watching this just made me think &quot;Thanos might be the only villain that has ever caused a lot if damage in any movie&quot;
I can’t wait to one day relive these movies through my kids
❤thor ❤
One day when i grow up ima introduce marvel to my kids since im a big marvel fan i watched every movie i understand the multiverse and all that i know what time period the mcu is in i know in what universe x men venom and every other one are based
I enjoyed the movie, but I think they ruined it by using time travel. Time travel makes no sense and is incomprehensible. It’s all nonsense. That’s why I made my own version where there is no time travel. And this movie loses a few points for MGBT propaganda.

😮‍💨None of us can Go behind 🥺
It&#39;s crazy here I am 5 years later having not seen the trailer since I saw the movie. And the what ever it takes Part, the last two to say it are widow and Tony 😢
Its like a drug I can&#39;t quit. Keep coming back here to feel that rush, that excitement I did when I watched it the for the first time.
❤🥺
From the ingenious Captain America, tech wizard Iron Man, and powerful Thor to the always angry Hulk, immensely clever Black Widow, and conniving Loki, all the characters irrespective of being a hero or an evil villain have thoughts on how life can be and words that can get you through some tough situations.The end of Phase 3 brought all the heroes together to fight off one imminent threat. The Avengers banded together to defeat Thanos one last time and get back the blipped population. Tony Stark was the unnamed leader of the gang and always mobilized them to do their best, not knowing that this would be the last battle he would experience alongside his friends.
Its 2024 and the hype for this movie is still the same. What I would give to experience it all over again.
😢❤
I wish I could go back to the day this trailer came out....The world changed in just 4 short years. This movie, those 3 hours in the theater was the last time things felt normal.
Bring back iron man😪
After endgame all marvel movies became 👎👎👎

2024🎉
Can&#39;t believe this trailer came out 3 years ago
Brie Larson is literally the worst thing to happen to Marvel.
This movie is so good that marvel literally died after this :(
What if Captain carter telling Avengers 😮 assemble
❤
Who else is here in 2024.1.1 ‼️😂
I can&#39;t believe this is the last time before MCU becoming a joke like nowaday.
Addiction of Mcu 🥺
“Now talk”
2024❤🥺
I’m 46 so I was around when Star Wars was at its peak but I didnt really get to enjoy or grasp its hype. The mcu infinity saga is my Star Wars.
My First YouTube search in 2024......🥳🥳🥳
2024
I was alive the day GTA 6 passed endgame
Avengers: Endgame wraps up an incredible phase of the MCU by packaging every amazing element we&#39;ve gotten from ten years of work and putting it into one of the greatest stories of the universe.
❤Tony I love you 3000
A series  that changed a generation
First day first show of this masterpiece was one in a lifetime experience. Not just about the movie, it&#39;s epic scenes, the fact that it was a culmination of 10 years of story building, but also about the collective craziness of that day&#39;s theatre. It felt like for once everyone regardless of where they came from united to celebrate this.
Biggest mistake i missed endgame in theatre 😢
❤
I remember when these were all c to b list characters. Most of them failed comic books. Cap, Thor, and Dr. Strange had terrible TV show one shots
Not watching the endgame in theatre was biggest mistake of my life, becoz of examination it sucks...
Daily coming
❤😢
Can’t believe how AMAZING the MCU once was! It all peaked with EndGame for sure! It’s been down-hill ever since, and no matter what it’ll never reach those heights - ever again!
❤
جودة عالية رهيبة واصل ابداعك ❤❤❤
Watching this 29th December 2023 and still gives me goosebumps
Avengers ❤ with doctor doom badass
Avengers Kang dynasty cancelled means you can choose Avengers Eternity warS  or Avengers batterworld from comics and
Best movies
What a time to be alive. 2016-19
This made me cry all over again.😭
Still got goosebumps ❤
For some reason i came here to watch this trailer after all these years <br>And i just can&#39;t describe the feeling <br>The way it took me back to the day it cane out <br>The expectations i had and how thrilled i was with this <br>Don&#39;t think any movie will ever give me all this hype again
This was so surreal, we&#39;ll never get to experience something like this again.
Ahh the first cancerous cell in the body, Captain Marvel
As an ardent fan of Marvel and MCU I myself stopped watching mcu movies after Endgame except Spiderman No Way Home, I really miss the OG 6 Avengers, it&#39;s like watching our favourite star movie without our favourite star. A great Era ❤
Even After watching this movie dozens of times, i still get goosebumps watching this trailer till this day 🔥🫠
How meticulously they put every scene into perfection.. Infinity war and Endgame .
Who’s here in the end of 2023
I&#39;m about to watch for the first time (I&#39;m 20 min in actually)!
-2019: Wow, this movie is amazing!<br>-2099: Wow, this movie is amazing!
Man, GTA 6 really broke the View RECORD 🥹
Going to miss kang he is not in Avengers Kang dynasty 😮 doctor doom is new villan of Avengers 🎉
GTA 6 trailer just took over💀
Congratulations GTA 6 for being better
Im In Love With Emma Thompson 😍😍
Everyone pls play pubg lite
Doctor doom 🤩
Avengers 😢
GTA VI TRAILER BEAT THIS
mcu suck now
GTA VI
A velha Marvel 😢
gta VI: hi
Meu auge é aqui 🛐🇧🇷🪄.
&quot;I keep telling everybody they should move on.... some do, but not us.&quot; = fans who remember how epic this saga was
The good old days of the MCU 😢
Nice movie
The fact that this trailer didn&#39;t have any action in it.  Just the most random scenes only makes it better with how epic they kept all of the secrets hidden. Crazy hype in hindsight
It really was the endgame
I just realized the similarities of Infinity War and Endgame to Alex Jones’ Endgame that released on 2007.<br><br>Alex Jones’ version is about new world order, eliminating 80% of population, much similar to this Marvel’s version with Thanos wipe out half of the population and become the new God
Ya an pasado 4 años de este bellisimo trailer
even nowadays I get goosebumbs while watching it
GTA 6 is COMING 😈
Who all are come after watching gta 6 trailer 😅
oh man , what i would do to go back
so close to being 5 years since endgame... 6 since infinity war. i remember being 11 when infinity war came out
This was truly a one time experience. No other movie probably will create this amount of hype again.
Em i finished watching this movie. I knew this was the last good movie in the Marvel Universe. Don&#39;t ask me how but i just knew it deep in me i wouldn&#39;t see anything similar again
Re-release this epic movie infinity war and End game 🔥
Still the greatest movie trailer of all time!  Still get goose bumps.
almost 5 years still cat forget
When MCU was good.
Over 4 years ago since this came out Jesus Christ, the hype for this was unreal, the marketing was good, everything about this movie was great. Exceeded expectations
GTA 6 tá chegando 🦈
Still goosebumps to this day!
Some time i think Thanos was right
When Marvel was at its Peak
the best thing about this trailer is it sets the tone without showing to many new scenes and the ones included don&#39;t show any revealing information it doesn&#39;t provide any plot points but my god it got us so hyped, i loved no way home and it was comparable in terms of theater excitement, but pretty much every setting was shown, a huge plot point and characters were shown, a trailer should never show more than half way through the movie and if it doesn&#39;t it should be near indecipherable, MoM also had this problem say want you want ab the marvels but it&#39;s final trailer was more in-line with this thought loki s2 as well and it seems like what if is closer to that too, and echo so it seems like they were finally able to stop the ship and have set a new course
Kang dynasty hopes 😮
Still watching🤧
Eat 5🌟 &amp; do nothing JL
I was 13 or 14 when Robert Downey Jr started playing Iron Man in the movie Iron Man.<br>He played for 11 years. I was in High school Chris Evens started Playing Captain America in the movies.
Littrely today also this teaser gives goosebumps.
This is where it all should&#39;ve ended.
1600+ Days since the release of Endgames and I haven&#39;t been able to find something better than this movie or this franchise <br>No other movie will ever make me feel those moments again, Not even from Marvels again
This makes me cry every single time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=5">0:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=16">0:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=29">0:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=49">0:49</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=73">1:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=89">1:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=97">1:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=111">1:51</a>
&quot;Whatever it takes.&quot; I would do egregious things to go back in time and experience Iron Man (2008), Civil War (2016), and Endgame (2021) again on opening night with zero spoilers.
GDM,they f&#39;up after this😂😢😂😂😂🎉
❤
Endgame was one of those movies that actually felt like a special event. It&#39;s pretty rare even among big budget films.
This trailer is still better then all the movies and shows after endgame. Exept now way home
If you are watching this in 2023 you are a legend
Islamic States
Still crying over the fact that I missed this masterpiece...late marvel fan....
And superhero movies have increasingly sucked ever since.
It took 4 years to reach 157m…meanwhile GTA VI is at 127m on day 2 😂
you just HAD to be there
miss this
Wish we could go back to this era
5 years ago this trailer was released…and this movie still being a masterpiece for the fans 🙌🏻
Marvel will never be the same again 😢
I Wish Vision Was Here.
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
2023 was End Game for Disney Marvel.
KGF ch2 view&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Avengers Endgame 🔥🔥🔥
Watching this trailer even after 4 years, this was the peak Marvel I experienced. The hype was so unreal, and I remember waiting a month felt like waiting a year for this movie. Such a masterpiece. I wish Marvel didn&#39;t fall off after endgame as they did.
Am i the only one who think that the Avengers secondary title: Infinity War and End Game should have swap as it kinda make sense?
Goosebumps still to this day 2023 going into 2024
Gta 6 ......9 million likes people
I was here before GTA VI beats this
The last great Marvel movie since
Who is here after gta 6 beat this??

Here after 4 years 🥲
Who is here after GTA VI Trailer?
Who&#39;s watching this after the sluggish marvel drought we have been in? I hope one day we will capture this again.
2 opções ou os roteristas são fodas ao ponte de prever algo que começa em 2023 num filme de 2012<br><br>Ou os caras que fizeram essa teoria tavam chapadão no dia<br><br>Acho q é a primeira opção
Still after 4 years this trailer still gives me goosebumps 🥶
Captain america waiting 😢
😢😢😢😢😢mcu
No one ever can create such hype ever again in the industry what this created sometimes I feel like crying thinking about this
&quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah. The Avengers were awesome&quot;<br>&quot;So then... Who are the Avengers now?&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Um... Idfk... Ms. Marvel?🤣&quot;
It honestly feels like the presence of Brie Larson in this trailer acts as a bad omen of what&#39;s to come. I imagine it to be like seeing the Grim Reaper in a corner, just lingering, waiting for its time to destroy what was once held dear. You only ever see glimpses, but you know it&#39;s there, just waiting...
Love how these trailers were so great and didn’t spoil a single thing in the movie. Doesn’t even mention time travel.
missing you Marvel
Bro it’s from tasm1 not amazing spider man 2. The title says tasm2
what a truly insane era. then that theater experience bro, the applauses, the laughs, the cries. truly one of the best experiences i’ve ever had the pleasure of having. i miss this hype era so much, honestly nothing will ever come close to it again.
Endgame movie hype like best thing in superhero movie fan
This came out for my 40th birthday and I got to see it with my kids and I&#39;ll never experience a movie like this live, it was the most amazing thing to watch, especially the energy and emotion of the crowd.
-Yes, Thor! I like this one too!<br>-After all this time?<br>-Allways
❤❤❤❤
Why am i so sad after watching this again 😭😭
Life peaked here
I still remember this moment vividly. I was really impressed with the last fight that put everything on my young heroes when this movie came out. In particular, I was really happy to have my favorite Spider-Man back alive, but I was really moved to tears by the sacrifice of Iron Man Tony. If possible, I would like to go back to before this movie came out and feel the thrill of watching it again.

We love you 3000 😢
I completely forgot the theme song. Almost creid when i heard it again.
You had to be there for Endgame &amp; Infinity War. PEAK superhero movies.....aaah can it be like this again ??
With the current state of the mcu right now idk how they’re gonna bring the hype for the trailer release of Avengers Kang Dynasty
The hype for this man….it’s never been the same since. One of the best superhero movies ever 🎥
After IW, the hype for the this movie was unreal…..I started counting down the days until the premiere! Since the marvel has lost its way but if there is any movie that can rekindle the hype that was endgame it’s Secret Wars!
@marvel, vuelvan a ver sus trailer y sabran lo epico que fueron sus peliculas.
Childhood memories what a days those are 😌
The hype, the emotion, the vibe <br>no other film can match this even after 100 years.
Biggest blockbuster of all time in the history
I&#39;m here, after years, and I can only think that I&#39;ll never have this emotion again, and that&#39;s sad
anjayyy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=112">1:52</a> Marvel fans after time travel gets invented.........
the good old days
This is not the end
2023 the year fight with Thanos and the dead our hero Iron Man Tony Stark <br><br>We miss you!!!
Gracias marvel por tanto, hasta Endgame habías trazado un camino no del todo Perfecto pero si muy especial y significativo para mi vida, de verdad. <br>Espero de verdad logres recuperar esa glorifica forma de hacer películas como antes, pero por ahora, ya no soy tan fan de lo qué haces y me duele. <br>Vuelve pronto Marvel a ser quien eras.
We had such high hopes. Then disappointment...
Ga kerasa udah 4 tahun aja
I cried after watching this even after 4 years
Muc Avenger endgame music hit hards 🙂
❤❤❤
Проплаченый комментарий.
I don&#39;t understand why infinity war is better than endgame. Endgame is the best movie in the mcu universe, so far and infinity war the second best.The end!
No idea how Marvel fell so hard from this. It wasn’t even that long ago. After this movie, they lost complete direction.
I miss the hype of this movie 😭
Timeless classic
We’re never gonna have a theater experience like endgame ever again
Feel like thousands years ago that Marvel was once an excellent series
エンドゲームみてぇわw
Man! Take me back to the time when we&#39;d sit and wait for the trailer, then watcj 100 videos of people dissecting the trailer. <br><br>Then going to the movie and losing our minds on that last scene. <br><br>Cinema peaked then
Que recuerdos 🥲
I&#39;m just now realizing that I never saw this trailer because I was avoiding spoilers like the plague, haha
Avengers Infinity War and Endgame will never be topped. Maybe if they somehow fox th3 mcu now, secret wars can top it 🤔  but man, these movies were peak. I had to actually reserve tickets a month before release
2023:still gives me chills😢
Bro I’ve literally watched both infinity war and endgame more times than I can count !!!😂😂😂 more than 5 times this year <br>I remember the chills I got in the theater <br>Me and my buddy had to ask for extra time on our lunch just to stand in line from 11 because tickets started selling at 1 <br>GOOSEBUMPS
Watched this for the first time recently, I felt so blessed to experience it for the first time after for years. Never gotten spoiled for me, did not even know Thanos was making a return.
Banan Alice: MCU is boring, Star Wars is better and has better characters, story....EVERYTHING...!!!! 🤣<br>Me: Hey Rocket? 😃<br>Rocket Raccon: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=89">1:29</a> 😃<br>Banan Alice: WHOAAA OKAY OKAY OKAY I&#39;M SORRY, I DIDN&#39;T MEAN TO SAY THAT...!!! PLEASE DON&#39;T KILL ME...!!!!! 😫<br>Captain America: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=90">1:30</a>
After this,the MCU died. It was good while it lasted though
It’s now november 2023 and it’s STILL the best marvel movie ever made.
Avengers kang dynasty 🤚waiting and my favorite thunderbolts
😢😢😢missing mcu
Sigma 😢
REALLY FEELS LIKE A THOUSAND YEARS OLD NOSTALGIA
There was an era when MCU was Sigma 🗿
Jesus Christ. Watching this still gets me. One of the most incredible achievements in movie history I think.
Movies like TFA, Endgame, and Infinity War shouldn&#39;t be considered as movies, they should be considered as global event. The hype for these were on another level!!
This trailer hits hard in November 2023…
I&#39;ll probably won&#39;t be hyped for any other movie the way i was for this back in 2019
This trailer is 100 times better than The marvels movie
The last good trailer
Looking back on the trailers and movies like Infinity Wars and Endgame is so great and to me it is crazy to think we are now at a further point in time than at Endgame which just blows my mind because when I watched the movie I was like wow 2023 is so far away and now we’re here. I’m also sad that the thing with Kang is all bad. I like Kang but of course he’s not as good as Thanos, but he was one of the best supervillains in movie history, so people hate him and now marvel might be replacing him which is just crazy.
Hass to be one of the greatest movie trailers of all time
Take me back.
THIS WAS THE END OF THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE
Ironman😥😥😥😥😟<br>Missss you so much<br>You gave us many memories 😢😢and you died
This is where everything started to go wrong.
Peak marvel
when marvel was making movies of the year not the farce of it
Thank you so much Hindi movie 😮😮❤❤❤❤
It really seems like a thousand years ago
Happy diwali 2023 from India ❤❤
Thank god i was born in this era
What a time to be alive to have witnessed such a masterpiece. Man brings back the hype back when Movies were amazing
Literally i m in 2024 but my mind is still in 2019.....(i can&#39;t move on)
Here after I watched The Marvels, trying to console myself
Who&#39;s here .... 2023
I like how they don&#39;t spoil anything it shows they try to just live with the smaller avengers squad and do whatever.
Its really the end game of marvel movies after the end game. Bring back IronMan RDJ. We need IronMan 4 to bringback a decent original marvel avengers.
Endgame was really good! But the thing I didn’t like was how Thor was but then again, if Thor was at his full strength it would been a bit easy to kill thanos
Important news to share with you that’s admittedly completely unrelated to the video.<br><br>For the person that’s reading this: Everyone of us are considered sinners in the eyes of God (natural rebels against His perfect law due to the fallen state of the world). Sinners deserve eternal punishment by God&#39;s perfect standard yet He made a way out for us through Jesus Christ’s death on the cross as full payment made on our behalf clearing our criminal record. <br><br>But how are we to receive this free gift? Repent of your sins (that is to make the decision to turn away from your sinful life) and place your faith entirely in Christ’s work on the cross as your savior from Eternal damnation. <br><br>Get into the Word of God (the Holy Scriptures) now to learn more about God, the true state of the world, and why we all desperately need Christ today. Call out to God with a genuine heart and He promises that He will make Himself known to you.
still a goosebump!!
i remember when end game released 4 years ago. I was 11 at the time and my dad asked if I wanted to watch a movie called &quot;Endgame&quot; didn&#39;t even know what that movie was since I&#39;ve never watched a marvel movie at that time. Really regret saying no to this movie since I can see how many people enjoyed it in theaters.
juriti
we really were in the endgame

Eu to chorando
who else come back after seeing The Marvels trailer, miss the old time😭😭
i still get goosebumps watching this i will always vividly remember watching this the day after it came out with my homie in the most hyped movie theatre i’ve ever seen
We really are in the endgame now with the route marvel be taking
This will never be topped no matter how hard they try..
man, what happened to the franchise....?
Seeing this on premier weekend and screaming at the reveals was the highlight of my experience
Marvel Movies died the day IronMan Died in endgame. Millions of fans are emotional and devastated ILY 3000. Please bring IronMan back!
Please bring back IronMan. marvel Avengers is not the same anymore without IronMan!
Put this against The Marvels&#39; latest trailers!! Oh how the MCU has fallen from their glory days!!
this made me cry seriously again again
This never gets old!<br>Down the memory lane....
Can I just erase my memories of seeing the Endgame? So I could watch it for the first time?
Please bring me back to 2019
I can’t wait for this movie to become a classic in 2188
Endgame&#39;s opening night will always be part of my core memory❤
I always cry I miss the good old avengers movies when I was little. I have every movie of it starting from Iron man to Guardian&#39;s of the Galaxy vol. 3
To think we was all happy before this
mid, aot better
Watching this on 2023 coz randomly popped up. Felt amazing as the first time watching it
Little did we know at the time, that not only would this movie mark the end of a decade-long saga, but also that it would mark the end of the franchise’s quality. Its all been downhill from here, and its showing no signs of getting better. This may as well be the end of the MCU as a whole.
How I wish could feel the same excitement…
This trailer is 1000 times better than recently released marvel shows,i expect this type of hype from marvel 🔥🔥
Kids these days will never know the hype we had for this movie
I feel MCU reached its peak with Endgame…. Now it seems very complicated with no strings
The day Tony died along with a whole franchise of movies
Man the great thing about this finale was the character journey and character development from each of the characters
Man, we had it so good back then.
We were once wondering who could take thanos because thor and captain marvel are only left of the strongest one&#39;s <br>oh God take me back
The best thing about infinity war was that, the final battle was during day light and this thing is missing in endgame . Final battle  is in dark
I have a feeling Tony and Steve will die …
You know it’s not the same as it was💔🙂
still epic asfck
The MCU will never be the same after Avengers Endgame 💯
What I would do to go back for the hype of this movie
Who is watching the trailer in 2023?
One of the best movies ever made
Soon, we&#39;ll be getting trailers for The Kang Dynasty &amp; Secret Wars.<br><br>at least not in a few years tho
That assembly scene has my whole heart ...iron man ❤❤
Whatever it takes ..... it&#39;s a emotion❤
Endgame is good but Infinity war was on another level. I got chills watching that.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=117">1:57</a>
The hype for this movie was good but the concepts are flawed. There will never be balance in any planet when half of life cease to exist, the other half can survive??? No!!
Eu era tão feliz
I hope Avengers: Secret War really meets the expectation. This movie really is the peak now.
We need marvel to bring back these kind of trailers
WHOS HERE IN 2023😅😅
truly like a thousand years ago...  watching this after all of phase 4 &amp; 5 made me think HOW COME I DIDN&#39;T NOTICE HOW BIG OF A RED FLAG TONY&#39;S NARRATION WAS (⁠ノ⁠ಥ⁠,⁠_⁠｣⁠ಥ⁠)⁠ノ⁠彡⁠┻⁠━⁠┻
4 years later and years to come, the new generation will never feel the hype of this movie it was the best experience for me when I go to the theatre with my family the first day it released oh man I miss so much that time
Whatever it takes ❤️‍🔥
Hi
Man!! No other movie can match the hype of infinity war and endgame. Once in a generation movies ❤❤
RIP Tony Stark. We love you 3000!
Days of future past second trailer had the same feels to this trailer😭😭
This trailer still brings back raw emotions 😢. Beautifully done
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=90">1:30</a> the &quot;whatever it takes&quot; lines are from Cap, Hawkeye, Black widow and Tony... the ones who LITERALLY did whatever it took to win the battle.
Watching this trailer in 2023 and it still gives me goosebumps
This movie really lived up to it&#39;s title. It was really the endgame of the mcu....R.I.P MCU 2008-2019
What have you become now ?<br>Shame on you Marvel！
i still remember the crowd ensemble truly something everyone came together to enjoy especially when my man lifted that hammer
Miss it here
This is one of the best movies ever made. The caliber of actors, action, storytelling…it will always stand the test of time.  We need Feige &amp; Disney to get back to this standard of excellence.
I love you 3000 ⎊
We&#39;re here, guys. Tony and Natasha die today.
Avengers assembled,captain america leading,iron man leaving behind his legacy,natsha dying,loki creating multiverse roots,spider man getting   <br>Teen boy,banner getting hulkxbanner together,thor with Guardians today is the endgame:18/10/2023
Ya 4 años de esta joya y cronológicamente ya sucedió ayer los acontecimientos  de Endgame hoy sería el funeral de Stark, descansa ❤🕊️
Last one is so epic🔥🔥🔥
17/10/2023😕💔
“Even if there’s a small chance…we owe this, to everyone who’s not in this room, to try” <br><br>Natasha Romanoff still giving me chills years later 💜
Happened yesterday
Today is the day Tony Stark died. 😢
On this special day, i tell you all, Marvel fans:<br><br>AVENGERS!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>.....assemble!
<b>R.I.P. TONY</b> 🫡<br><b>May 29, 1970 - Oct 17, 2023</b><br><b>I love you 3000</b>
Happy Endgame Day.
Can&#39;t believe today is the day we lost Tony Stark
Knowing this movie came out prior to Covid Restrictions makes it seem like a thousand years
Jseqppi
Nunca haverá uma era tão boa quanto essa!!!
POV: You came back to this now that it&#39;s October 17th, 2023.
Even in 2023 still give insane amount of goosebumps as it was before. Masterpiece! 🔥🔥🔥
&quot;Take me back to the night we met&quot; 🥺
God the hype for this movie was unreal, something which all of us are lucky to live through. One of the finest masterpieces ever made. ❤️
To think after 4 years and this is still in my recommended
This trailer still gives me goosebumps.
When Marvel was still Marvel…
The biggest hype ever
I&#39;m just here to watch peoples reaction to the trailer at that time 😅
“ God, seems like 1000 years ago” almost 5 years later that line hits different
free me bhi  upload kardo
Awesome
No marvel hype can match this…yet
❤
Ведь было время! Без Covid-19, без воин все жили в мире, что с нами стало не так? Миру мир!!!
I miss the old hype for movies like this 😢 now everything is boring and bad
I remember that the opening was exactly on my birthday, and I was excited to watch it with my dad, &#39;till we did, and it wasn&#39;t as exciting as I initially thought it was. It was crushing &lt;/3
I remember that the opening was exactly on my birthday, and I was excited to watch it with my dad, &#39;till we did, and it wasn&#39;t as exciting as I initially thought it was. It was crushing &lt;/3
I still come here to watch this trailer
I remember when this Trailer came the title is Marvel Studios&#39; Avengers
2023 still new for this Movie
Back on 2019 I was so excited for Endgame but ever since Iron-Man/Tony Stark died it broke my heart I almost cry
its been four years one of the amazing movie of all time i watched it... love it watching anytime❤
❤
Hi to those in other universes, Tony Stark will die in this movie of our universe.
I need avenger back...
Love you 3000❤
See you guys in kang dynasty and secret wars
The movie that heightened expectations all the way up for most people about any Marvel project that came out after and ruined people&#39;s views about movies or shows that are actually decent or good. Not EVERY project is going to be Endgame level, people
love you 3000
4 years and imo still one of the most hyped, anticipated movie trailers ever. I miss prepandemic arc 😭🤣
2023 and i am here
And that&#39;s my guy -the one and only qarun-gOD
In the end how could Captain America return the tesseract &amp; time stone... That reality  is reset or pruned as Loki created Nexus Event... So that reality doesn’t even exist.<br>So where did Cap return the Tesseract &amp; Time Stone??
Always and forever the best ❤
Always and forever the best ❤
:(
This trailer suddenly appeared on my youtube page. I missed Endgame era :(
It’s 2023 but this trailer still gives me goosebumps&gt;&gt;&gt;♥️<br>And this movie will forever remain a masterpiece.
Came in suggestion ❤ i thought he is returning
Seeing this in theaters was a once in a lifetime experience that I truly don&#39;t think will ever be recreated.  At the time it was difficult to even get friends together for a hangout, but everyone got together to see this on opening night.
Man this movie coming to theaters had me hyped and excited to watch it happen. Miss the old days 😔
it&#39;s been almost 4 years now and i keep watching this trailer and it keeps giving me goosebumps ♥
Thor ⚡
Over powered captain Marvel
Today is the day when endgame happens  oct 2023
Natasha:See u in a minute... Me watching it 10th time <br>:NO you&#39;re not Nat😭😭😭
It&#39;s official. Today is when the events of the movie start taking place in 2023. Today (October 3rd) is when Steve meets with the therapy group and Scott returns from the Quantum Realm.
Whatever it takes.
I concern all comments
Trailer itself: 10/10<br>Music: 100/10
Tony made an offer people couldn’t refuse
The flashback of iron man and captain America says it all 😭
whatever it takes - It will take the best super hero &quot;Iron Man&quot;
I&#39;m excited for Secret War
I hope future marvel movies can receive this type of hype again
Its about time but im still here❤️
Whatever it takes!
Brings back that excitement for this movie
I like to think it was a team effort. Even the dead were capable of making an impression on the living. But. If you really go over the movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=1363">22:43</a>, it was a rat that defeated Thanos. And. Just wondering about the script people, because it&#39;s total genius. I guess in the spirit of &#39;quantum&#39; reality, a rat that wanted his kids and wife back, had to be in a LOT of emotional pain to do what he did. Where is he now? Planning the next Avengers: Endgame?
Literally I have chills and so much emotion right now even though I’ve seen this movie a million times! 😭😭<br><br>Goodness, I really hope Marvel Studios can get their act together and start producing movies and characters we actually care about, instead of just being driven by revenue from over saturation, be driven by actual good storytelling.
Please bring back the old marvel
4yrs later and I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve seen this movie in theaters. I still get chills from seeing this trailer. This was peak MCU. ❤️
Good! ☆☆☆☆☆
Hmm yeah I like this one the mighty words of thor
Whatever it takes &quot;akhri saas tak&quot;<br><br>Goosebumps 👍<br>Love from india🇮🇳
We want this Marvel back😢
Aahhh marvel bring back this era i beg you 😭❤
😢
Never Ever Something like this happened in the history of Cinema..Ever single time it gives me goosebumps and tears of joy ..This was Once in  a lifetime experience...So glad to be a part of it ❤
Peak Marvel.. never gonna be the same. Rip Stark and Cap, and many other OGs❤✊
Hoping that Secret Wars will have the same vibes
Tony😢😢
Ssr❤
The hype for this was truly unreal… unlike any other!
I dont think ill ever live to see such a better cinematic movie like infinity war and endgame, they might be the most hyped best movies ill ever see
Aadadadadad
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Still can&#39;t believe our childhood is over now😢.&quot;We should move on whatever it takes&quot;
Again watching in 2023
We all know what came after this the mind numbingly bad phase 4 and 5
Every HERO there is, &quot;AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!!!&quot;
Came back to this masterpiece and cried watching this
4 años cuando marvel era un exito, yo se que volveran a esos tiempos de oro
I hope secret wars is going to be like this
Not even spider man 2 has the hype this movie had
looking back on this now, now i understand the grey with the red.
Rest in Peace RDJ😢🥹
It has been 4 years but I can say that this is the BEST movie I&#39;ve seen in mu life❤
What a movie that was
4 years feel like four days
This is greatness
“We will, whatever it takes.”
&quot;i keep telling everybody they should move on...some do..but not us&quot; - this seems so apt when i have come back again 4 years later to watch the trailer
Masterpiece in movies history
Feel like it was just yesterday man...
i would give anything just to watch endgame for the first time again
Back when things weren&#39;t woke and the writing and characters didn&#39;t suck! BRING BACK THE RUSSO BROS PLEASE!!!!
Love you 3000 ♥️
Cómo que ya pasaron 4 años 😟
I don’t think I will ever be as excited for any movie ever again as I was for IW &amp; Endgame. The thrill of the wait, then opening night, being in a theater packed with other fans, experiencing it together…there was nothing better than that.
I wanna to forget this movie... And watch it again
The Infinity War and Endgame era was the single greatest time for comic book movies. If you ask me, the MCU ends when the credits roll in Endgame.
Captain Rogers one dialogue &quot;You had to move on&quot; changed my life
Kentut kejap boleh
..
I WATCHED THIS IN 4-D IN IT&#39;S OPENING WEEK. THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE💯🏁🔥👏🏿
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=80">1:20</a>
Whatever it takes😊
Esta película siempre va a ser la mejor del UCM
Seeing this 1st showing at night was epic….ppl were reacting like we were shoulder to shoulder in wakanda… untouchable moment for a life long marvel fan
I remember how excited I was for this movie and my dad bought tickets for my family on the night it premiered. great memories haha
Anyone back here cause Endgame happens in 2023?
When marvel was in its own class.
And a look back on a beautiful monument in time
Remember wen the trailer drop I was so excited🔥
The last great Marvel Movie with the exception of Guardians 3 which was a good movie.<br>After End Game, it was all over. Spider-Man Movies don&#39;t count since those were always great and affiliated with Sony since they own the rights to the Character :D
I miss that hype, theories, anticipation, the excitment. Once in a lifetime experience.
The scenes, the actors, the dialogue, the music,<br>After 4 yr still gives me goosebumps 💥
I havent seen a single movie of these superheroes...and i see that ppt in comment sections want to be like me 😂 to again feel the first time of this movie or these movies...So let&#39;s start....i think i m the only one who has not seen any of these movies or do not about...so i will start watching these series now...suggest me which movie should i watch first?
Why is this back in my feed
Still imo the best MCU movie. Infinity War was still amazing but I still like Endgame more.
Watching this in 2023 and still getting goosebumps. Miss the old Marvel &lt;3
🇺🇸Scarlett🇺🇸Johansson🇺🇸34🇺🇸
Like👍.. who Love❤ Tony stark ⚡😎
I get goosebumps even today 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Our kids will have no idea what this meant for us, to live it.
Now they dont make movie like this anymore 😭😭
Marvel Studios really made us experience the nostalgia😢
Omg i remember when this came out
That &quot;whatever it takes&quot; from RDJ... Pure goosebumps 😢
Man marvel was too hype
The MCU has gone down the pan since this film came out, it really was the Endgame of Marvel.
Bro forget the new saga I wish we can go back to old Mcu

Hello Marvel team! Is there a possibility to bring back and launch the Infinity Saga movies in stunning UHD 4k quality? It would be fantastic if you could utilize the Original DI files or IMAX sources (if accessible) along with Dolby Vision for an enhanced experience. The existing UHD discs haven&#39;t quite captured the best quality, so this would be a remarkable treat for all of us fans!
The trailers are all so amazing and all hit even harder after you’ve seen the movie
Whatever it takes!
When Thor said, I gotta Doodoo on Thanos.<br>I shat myself
I wish that shot of Thor with Stormbreaker was in the film, the shot in the trailer with the music is so devastating
Still the best final to any movie series ever. To unite so many characters/superheroes in one movie is truly a masterpiece.
Sill the most epic finals in any movie series ever. To unite so many superheroes in one movie excellently is a masterpiece.
I miss Tony Stark
I&#39;m still stuck in here😢
iron man
&quot;An festival Bigger than Diwali&quot;<br>😌😌
4 years passed and I still watching the trailer of the greatest movie of all time.
This Film 4 years age released
Welcome back we know this isn’t your first time
What ever it takes.🙏🧡🤍💚
Some people stop watching trailers after the movie.<br>But not us
Is anyone else pissed off that it’s all over?
It&#39;s kinda sad that phases four and five couldn&#39;t live up to the Endgame hype.
Search kgf chapter 2 traler😂😂😂
2023 anyone?
Endgame Era was truly beautiful to experience. I miss these days
I hope this is good, and that captain marvel is in it and doesn&#39;t ruin it. :)
This movie looks dope, can’t wait for it to come out
Today is the day when TONY STARK AND HULK BRING EVERYONE BACK<br>Its Aug 2023
Why recommended me now😅
Everything after no way home has been a roller coaster but guardians 3 was amazing but remember the mcu can still be roller coaster
Oh.. marvel...I just miss you dude what marvel then and what marvel now😢.. bring back old marvel to us❤
Who is watching this Trailer in 2023 !!! One of the best cinematic experience ever and Tony stark I miss you ❤
Why Valkyrie say “He won’t see you” about Thor? Was happy as it gets to see Hullk and Rocket. Fat and sad but no sense of not wanting too see them. Scene still bothers me. 😉
It was 4 years ago still one of my favourite movies EVER!
The worst part at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=146">2:26</a>
Still better than justice league 2017
Man this gave me goosebumps when i first saw the trailer
This trailer was epic. Have to wonder how Secret Wars can top this.
اعظم فيلم خيال علمى في تاريخ البشرية 👍🏽
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=99">1:39</a> Natasha&#39;s gunshot sync with bgm giving me goosebumps
Will do what ever it takes -widow what ever it takes-iron man
In my country getting first day ticket for this movie was so difficult such was the hype for this movie
Missing old daye
Ok so I know captain wanted to stay in the past and live with his girl but I want to be selfish and say that I wish he just stayed TT<br>Scarlet shouldn&#39;t have just died and they should&#39;ve ended up together<br>I will pretend that happened<br>ok bye
So much has changed in 4 years.
it can&#39;t be 4 years ago man...
the last time i watched any marvel stuff and got goosebumps..
I remember how excited me and my brother was the first time we saw on IMDB that a movie called avengers was coming out, we didn&#39;t believe it at first but then it all came to be <br>So sad to see things ending so fast, I wish there was more . <br>It all started from iron man and now here we are TT TT TT
After 4 years I finally watched this movie<br>...<br>WORST MOVIE EVER, I WILL PRETEND THINGS ENDED LIKE IT DID IN INFINITY WAR<br><br>They took away everyone that I love and brought back everyone that I didn&#39;t care about
Wow this feels so weird watching this rn?
after endgame, corona virus came :(
End of Golden Era with this one...miss that time :(
No matter how many time i watched Endgame.....This trailer hit me likes the movie is still realising
Marvel Died after this Masterpiece.
I MISS YOU NATTTT😢PLS RETURN NAT PLSSSSSSS😢MY GODDES COME BACK TO THE MCU😢😢😢
Miss you Iron man
I don&#39;t know why ! I&#39;m still watching this trailer now. 2023
Im watching this in 2023 a day before my semester exams to hype myself up and be motivated and it works everytime
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=55">0:55</a>, the part where they show Asgard, the BGM was godly, for the first time Asgard ever felt like a place where gods live!
infinity/10
The masterpiece✨✨✨
Waiting for Avengers kang Dynasty
I wish I could erase my memory just to watch this masterpiece again
i miss da hype for endgame and infinity war tht was tha greatest experience eva
This movie was a masterpiece now this is hypeing me up for Avengers Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars❤❤❤❤❤😊
Remember the days when we were waiting for this movie to continue the story
Timeless classic ❤💫
Feels like it was just some time ago when the hype was the biggest in the whole world. Realized now it was years ago but the goosebumps watching it still feels the same. Marvel, you did it❤❤
How was Endgame 4 years ago? 😦
The Legend
Fragmanın tonyle başlaması, en son “ne pahasına olursa olsun” sözünü tonynin söylemesi kalbimde derin bir yara açtı.
Missing that day
Seems like a thousand years since these movies were consistently good
I still remember how they kept the title secret and everyone were speculating about what it could be and them this trailer coming out of nowhere and disrupting everything
Manga iron Man aku penggemar beratmu bang iron Man
I am currently going through a blip muself
I Hope Secret Wars Is Hype
This trailer is x100 better than all Disney + series and movies that have come so far from Marvel
The part of the journey is end😢
Miss the good ol days
Best marvel movie
Even today this trailer gives me chills
Life was good When I saw this trailer for first time
Watching this even now gives goosebumps 🔥
It&#39;s been 4 years 😢❤
Theres a new avengers movie coming out called kang dyansty out at 2026
MCU became silent after the death of IronMan. Pls bring him back!
Bring back Iron Man pls. Marvel is not complete without IronMan. My first avenger marvel movie is IronMan and I’ve been hooked with Marvel Movies because of IronMan.
I just came back for a bit of nostalgia to watch this masterpiece of a superhero movie!
There is no way it’s been 4 years
Spoiler!: Ironman dies

What to say about a movie whose even  TRAILER gives goosebumps even it was 4 years old.
Who is watching in 2023
Watching this trailer in 2023 makes me cry even more
Bring me back please 🥺😭
I stopped caring about the mcu after endgame
All the future people being born in the 2020s and onward, will be jealous of everyone else who got to watch this in theatres for the very first time.
Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t witness this in theaters but even at home... sometimes I can&#39;t bring Myself to watch it because of how emotional it can be
Nostalgic 😢 I miss these mcu days, I cried watching this
I miss those &quot;AVENGERS&quot; badly 😢
Thanks YouTube to revive a memory.
Не пишите спойлеры 🤬
2023
Seems like a good movie.
My monthly &quot;I missed them&quot; session
Who knows in 2018 avengers will gather again and tony and black widow is going to die
God the writing was good back then
Can&#39;t believe rhodey missed this as skhrodey
Perfect masterpeice
let me guess 4 years later youtube is suggesting this to you
I&#39;ve only cried in three movies: The Lion King, Charlotte&#39;s Web, and now, Avengers: Endgame. This movie was Epic.
More like Marvel endgame
Люблю этот фильм 3000

This is not Avenger&#39;s end, it&#39;s end of Marvel
4 year complete 🎉
By the infamous Stark mode

<b>The last time Disney created a decent MCU film.</b>
Whenever i see Rhodey in this Trailer i realized now that he is a Skrull who fought 🥲
God this... this like litrally thisss feels like a thousand years ago.... everytime i re watch the trailer....it just hits me with nostalgia....that hypee and i realise how much we were happy and time was simpler❤
i am going to Watch This Movie Again ❤
2023 and still this trailer gives goosebumps ❤
Greatest movie of all time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=99">1:39</a> Natasha&#39;s Gunshot sync with Bgm is just Goosebumps🔥
I unfollowed all the pages related to marvel and spoilers memes pages 2 month before its relaese. And I was lucky to watch this movie without spilers. Great experince.
Any one watching this in 2023😢
Bro 156M views. That’s just amazing.
Funny how this is coming up on my recommended, i would give anythinf to rewatch this in the movie theaters for the first time again 😖
The true ending of the MCU ❤
This trailer give a me chills
The hype for infinity war and endgame was crazy. People in my school were spoiling the ending for endgame left and right. It was crazy
🥰🥰
Its been 4 year&#39;s but still goosebumps 🫶🤌
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=119">1:59</a> 🥵💥
This got recommended to me after finishing Secret Invasion. Even YouTube wants me to remember how it was...<br>MCU ENDED RIGHT AFTER THIS. INFINITY SAGA 3000<br>Miss the hype<br>Miss the times<br>The good old days...
MCU died after ENDGAME.
Thanos was right though.... do you get it?
4 years already.. wow
Honestly Marvel ended for me after ENDGAME<br>3000❤
It’s weird thinking about a time before we knew about Covid…
Watching this makes me miss the Marvel I knew.  The Infinity Saga was a masterpiece.  The Mulitverse Saga is a dumpster fire.  Nice work, Disney.
It&#39;s 2023 but still the Avengers theme got me goosebumps in my whole body ❤ !
Those were the days
The Avengers Also Died in the Endgame<br><br>The Idea The Remarkable People<br>The Era Of Heros All is Now a History;
It seems like a thousand years ago
Best movie ever
long time no see
I really wish I can visit 2019 again to feel all the hype and the emotion when the movie came out 😢😢😢
I remember the hype for IW and EG…. Man were those the good old days. It doesn’t even feel like it’s been 4 years..<br><br>“The world has changed, none of us can go back, all we can do is our best, and sometimes the best we can do, is to start over.”
crazy it&#39;s been 4 yrs
It&#39;s been 4 years hih!! 💔🙃
mcu should have ended right here
Why are we getting this recommended now🤣
I still remember it all. It&#39;s still feels like yesterday for me
The hype in this movie is insane Best marvel movie ever they have my support for this movie
My god... I really want to go back to those days... 😢😢😢
4 years later, this pops up on my recommended
Que recuerdos 🥲
Broo really miss those days🥲🥲
God it seems like a thousand years ago now in 2023❤ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c&amp;t=5">0:05</a>
I got recommended this 4 years later and I still can’t believe we’re in the same universe we’re we got Endgame
All im gonna say is. Im so glad I was born in 1997. I got to see the lord of the rings hype, then I got the harry potter hype, and I got the MCU phase 1-3 hype. It was a beautiful time growing up. I dont think anything will come close in terms of hype as far as series for movies its gonna be a while till we have something like these 3 again
Remember, those years were one of the best years for Marvel fans. I hope the happy moments of that year will be repeated again
It feels like a 1000 years ago this trailer happened...so much happened in between
4yrs still one of the best....
I miss the infinity saga😢😢😢😢😢
Rhodey  skrull
Why this is in my YouTube Sugestion list after four years again 😂😂😂 nostalgia
Rhodey: Skrulls😂
I got it recommended ❤ hurray🎉🎉
Feels like yesterday this movie released but next thing we know its been a whole 4 years😢
This was an Era. ❤
No movie can ever top the hype for this movie🔥🔥🔥
I wish we could go back in time and relive the Hype of this movie🙇‍♂️😪<br><br>I can&#39;t believe its been 4 years am really getting old
Best trailer ever😭😭
This AVENGERS ENDGAME trailer still give us goosebumps ‘til now.

Am dying and crying from inside...I just want to watch it again as a first timer... please come back old Marvel .. I know my word&#39;s can&#39;t justice my emotions right now...as it hard to explain
