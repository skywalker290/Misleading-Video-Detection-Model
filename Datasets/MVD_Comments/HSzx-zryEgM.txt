Benedict Cumberbatch is really perfect for the role!!
This is it. It was a great movie. This is what it should be. There is no childish humor, there is no pity or endearment under the name of genocide. If it is going to be a movie, it should be away from such messages. Also, Thor&#39;s inclusion was a nice reference. I hope Dr. Strange movies do not break the line. If you watch Marvel in Chronological form, you will understand it better.

I miss the old days when marvel released these types of marvel trailers.😢🥺
2017 was 7 years ago
Я только сейчас поняла, что название фильма очень многообещающе звучит. Я уже не испытываю этого просто так, потому что знаю этого персонажа. Но это можно легко почувствовать, если забыть на секунду, что вы его знаете. Просто посмотреть глазами обывателя. Фильм: Доктор Стрэндж, звучит интересно, т.к. фильмы про врачей зачастую очень затягивают, а то, что он стал магом, на момент выхода трейлера, это вообще огонь. Надеюсь, вы поняли😂❤
Похоже фильм доктор Стрэндж, 2016
Multiverse of Madness was good, but it just didnt give the same magical feelings as the first one did
Precisely true 😮

still the best
My favorite 🥰
Back when doctor strange was both cool and smart
My dads favorite superhero was Doctor Strange I wish me and him could have gone and seen this movie in 2016 but he died in 2001.  I bet he would have loved it.

Doctor Strange plays the piano??!

Come back
Thank you, marvel to shoot this great movie in our country Nepal.❤❤❤🙏

I love this movie so much ❤

2021 doctors strange telah master
&quot;I have spent so many years, peering through time, looking for you.&quot; awesome dialog, gives me goosebumps for some reason.
I just hope the former director that directing this film came back for the sequel and also the same vfx team. The whole movie experince for me was exquisite and rewatcheable everytime
Hes the best actor for this role
The music is best
It‘s just a perfect movie! I love it really! But do anyone of you know the soundtrack of this trailer? I didn‘t find it. Can you help me, please?
How did we get from THIS to MOM!<br>the downgrade -_-<br>I really hope DS3 will be good, and mcu should use this soundtrack and Doctor Strange&#39;s original theme from the 1st movie
&quot;We never lose our demons, morda. We only learn to live above them&quot; - the wise one
Smaug might be Cumberbatch’s iconic and irreplaceable role but his best performance is Doctor Strange
ahead of it&#39;s time imho...like the wizard of oz or even buckaroo banzai
sinister strange vs dr strange WHICH is the PRIME Universe in a MULTI VERSE reality?
I come back to say doctor strange is better than 2
I&#39;ve seen this movie. It&#39;s one of my favorites.
This movie is a masterpiece
Beautiful trailer, great story of movie but Strange you can&#39;t even defeat Scarlet Witch. Embarrassed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=129">2:09</a>
6 years after it&#39;s a very underrated MCU movie

Me watching this trailer in 2022 and realizing how good marvel cgi used to be
Her hands...
The movie of satanic
When CGI and detail mattered to them 🚶🏼
Coba lihat sendiri ni ,
rip
This is better than Doctor Strange MOM
I watched all the marvel movies before this just because I wanted the experience so I could feel what everyone else felt but honestly now that I&#39;m at the movie that made me want to watch everything...girl, my heart is already too beaten down. Girl, I JUST finished watching Civil War....I can&#39;t even function...I just...man, lol, I hope I really love this movie because I&#39;m starting from a very bleak place . My chest hurts lol
I&#39;m kind of hoping Scott or Sam come back for the third film (most likely it&#39;ll be part of phase 6), I think both films are pretty great. <br>Hopefully for the story will be a little more streamlined focusing on Doctor strange and Clea, possibly even having strange pass the torch.
One of the most underrated marvel films. Thought it was way better than the sequel.
He keeps getting better and multiverse of madness is proof😂😂😂
one of the best movie of mcu.
I think both films are pretty good but this one has a little more nuance and a much simpler story.
This movie is such a masterpiece when comparing it to Multiverse of Madness.
Woww...
Cool video!!!
Who&#39;s here after watching doctor strange 2
🔥🎸
I&#39;m Here After Doctor Strange 2 And The Character Development Of Strange Is Still Consistent!!
“My Moms”😵‍💫 these woke ideologues are total LOONS… might as well be illiberal anti equality maniacal man haters. At least in the history of the “tyrannical male hierarchy” men never wanted to abolish women. If these ideologues had their way they’d wipe men off the face of earth. 😵‍💫🙄
＠＠＠＠＠
I loved.{😍}
It is not trailer 2 it is trailer 1
Jesus saves❤️✝️
My favourite marvel movie
I looooove Strange!!!
À <br><br>Sass&#39;s<br><br><br>Sdsswwqaew
Even today watching this 6 year old flim gives chills ; soundtrack , Jaw dropping visuals and Benedict as dr strange 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Nailed the character
“Shamballa” - Elizabeth Olsen, MOM Press Tour

How to download this movie
He went from this to fighting Thanos and the Scatlet Witch, helping Spider-Man with a multiverse crisis and meeting Professor X and Mr Fantastic
So adoring💚
Cant wait
After MOM, this makes me appreciate this film even more. I loved this more than the sequel. This trailer&#39;s theme is also one of my favourites. Dystopia by Hi Finessse.
Movie for dummy people,like you people..!!!
HE WENT FROM “I CANT DO THIS” TO STANDING HIS GROUND AGAINST WANDA ACROSS THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS!!!
Just watching the trailer lowers IQ by 10 points . There is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie.
Dr Strange &gt;&gt;&gt; Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness
Wait for Doctor Strange 3 here
Better than Triverse of Midness
Finally
Still one of the best trailers of all time
Saya suka dengan film ini sungguh sangat hebat MARVEl keren banget salam dari saya Agus

Who’s here before Multiverse of Madness

Doctor Strange was released in theaters on my second maternal uncle&#39;s birthday in 2016.
BEST MARVEL TRAILER OF ALL TIME
I really regret not seeing this at my movie theater. Watching it at home just doesn’t compare 😒
يا ايها الذين امنو لا تلهكم اموالكم ولا اولادكم عن ذكر الله ومن يفعل ذالك فاولئك هم الخاسرون
Magic didn&#39;t begin with Thor. Magic began with Doctor Strange!<br>So I guess. Either way, DS was awe-inspiring!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=98">1:38</a> &quot;I&#39;VE SPENT SO MANY YEARS PEERING THROUGH TIME... LOOKING FOR YOU.&quot; 🥶🥶🥶
I’m so glad to be alive and experience all of it. Multiverse of madness let’s goooo
Trailer looks nice. Second part of this movie will be madness...
Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man are gonna meet him one day….if I said that when this came out no way anyone would believe me
the tibetan monk here was make white instead of tibetan to appease the ccp. boycott this garbage marvel
This trailer is good, but multiverse of madness trailer is better since it constantly brings the excitement to wait the surprises to be revealed.

Watching Dr. Strange has the same feeling of being high on weeds.

I love this movie so much, it might be one of my favourite MCU standalone movies. Benedict Cumberbatch nails it as Stephen Strange, the movie is so visually imaginative and the first glimpses of the multiverse are exciting as hell. Can&#39;t wait for Multiverse of Madness!

It&#39;s a joke the caption of this trailer and VERY  disturbing for disabled people!!!!
after seeing these marvel stuff, people just get into it so much that they forget to like
Who&#39;s watching the old trailers like me?
I’m still wondering why the movie isn’t called Mr Doctor
HOLY CRAP i forgot how awesome this trailer theme is
I wish the makers use this score in doctor strange 2
This trailer is immoral
Loki Finale ----} Doctor Strange 2
Sherlock vs Hannibal
Here after loki finale🤣🤣
Doc its your time now there are so many job you have to do 🤣 thanks to loki sylvie
i misread this as doctor strange 2 trailer and got hype but this is made me rewatch the first movie
Just for views like wtf
We expected someone to come with a cameo in WandaVision...
&quot;Mr....?<br>Doctor<br>Mr Doctor??<br>Its Strange...<br>Maybe. But who am i to judge&quot;

Ooh I really wish along with Wanda loki would also be in this movie <br>That would make it chaotic and mischief at the same time😍😍😍😍😍💥💥💥
I literally almost had a heart attack because i thought it said &quot;Doctor Strange 2 Trailer&quot; I almost died-
Not all heroes wear capes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Some wear cloaks
&quot;How long have you been in Kamar Taj, Mr...?&quot;<br>&quot;Doctor!&quot;<br><br>...<br>&quot;Mr. Doctor?&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s... Strange&quot;<br>&quot;Maybe, who am I to judge?&quot;
for a second i thought this is doctor strange 2 trailer
Doctor Strange2 coming out on 2022
Amazing how this movie became prophetic... The world is changing, and Beast is rising (in movie its &quot;durmammu&quot; &amp; invaders and its the byblical dragon IRL). As hopefully, the good forces are prepared.
This movie ruined my high and had me dozing off
This movie is boring and lame af!!! Go watch ant man instead
Heard this is a good movie to watch on lsd, let’s find out
Greatest MCU trailer of all time
Who here after Marvel announced to kill of Strange?<br>Goodbye Dr.Strange........you will always be one of my favorite Superheroes......
&quot;A Sorcerer is a Wizard without a hat&quot; <br>                                         -Captain America(new)(Sam Wilson) 2021
i just realized that anyone could just take the time stone from doc, go into space and use the time stone on earth and go back in time.
I want a doctor strange 2 trailer not doctor strange trailer 2
I love drax’s cameo in this
The actual real proof Doctor Strange can see the future... He wears a face mask
mystic arts
HE WAS MEANT TO BE THE BEST OF US
Doctor press Ctrl+Z and everything gets alright😅
after years, I still like the film &amp; its trailers. :)
This is the end. The Word Of God who dwelt amongst flesh is coming for His own people very soon Those who prepare for the return of Jesus Christ now, and seek a relationship with Jesus Christ, will not be disappointed in the near future. They will find themselves worthy for the rapture. The Greatest Event in Human History. They will be caught up to be with Jesus Christ on the clouds. All the innocent children of the world will also be taken during the rapture. Those left behind will experience the Great and Terrible Day of The Lord. Those who&#39;ve taken the Covid-19 vaccine have no more hope for salvation.<br><br>Those who love Jesus Christ need to avoid the Covid-19 vaccine. Anyone who recieves the vaccine will find themselves outside the gates of heaven. They will be utterly rejected by God for destroying the image of God within them. Those who take the Covid-19 vaccine, are legally subjected to satan for all eternity. Do not take the vaccine, if you love Jesus Christ. I warm because I warn because I care with all my heart. I find no pleasure in the death of sinners.<br><br>It&#39;s not God&#39;s will that anyone perish, but all repent to recieve eternal life. Jesus Christ loves everyone dearly. Please seek Him while the doors of mercy are still open. Those left behind, who haven&#39;t taken the Covid-19 vaccine, will have to die for their faith in Jesus Christ. This is the end, everything written in the book of revelation will be fulfilled.
This is a mixture of inception+Tenet+Harry Potter+Sherlock Holmes
This soundtrack haunting me for years. It&#39;s amazingly wonderfull, but I can&#39;t find it. Can I get any help PLEASE?
movie: doctor strange<br>scene: nepal<br>movie: english<br>hero: dr strange
<b>Doc</b>
Oh come on this is the original movie not the second one
just watched it yesterday, i loved it.
The music is epic
Inception 2 👀
Can wait for Doctor Strange in the  Multiverse of Madness Trailer release
Inception : &quot;Is he with you? &quot;<br>Tenet : &quot;I thought he was with you.&quot;
This is my favourite movie doctor strange and the sound track
Marvel certainly know how to make a good trailers
Trailer your head. This just dr strange clip.
Best marvel movie
This is the best marvel movie I&#39;ve seen, and I&#39;ve watched endgame...
I&#39;m just waiting for multiverse of madness&#39;s trailer 🥵
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩❤
lmao i thought it said Doctor Strange 2 Official trailer
benedict cumberbatch fans hit a like here
This is dr strange 1 trailer not 2
&quot;Doctor Strange 2 Official Trailer&quot;<br>Me: WHAT... oh
Pete&#39;s Dragon Suicide Squad Storks and Boo Madea 🎃AMC 🎭 and summer 2016 DVD&#39;s like Jungle Book and Beast 25th
&quot;Your WIFI Password&quot; still Cracks me up 😂
Benedict Cumberbatch literally looks comic accurate not only his costume but also his face
“What’s this? My Mantra?”<br>“The WiFi password... We’re not savages.”
You all may steal India&#39;s secret..<br>But Father will always remain father
Search for &quot;Doctor Strange 2&quot; and im here ..
I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been waiting for four years
Do u get human chills with background music or are you normal
i just realized.... this movie was released the day after trump won
I THOUGHT IT SAID DOCTOR STRANGE 2 TRAILERRR AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
plot twist: the ancient one was driving the other car
Gandalf : &quot;Is he with you? &quot;<br>Harry Potter : &quot;I thought he was with you.&quot;
Sorcerer Supreme in his big screen debut
Click bait
This is so fake this ain’t doctor strange 2 them fakers
There is no other way by mordo <br><br><br>same dialogue in infinity war by strange to tony : Tony there was no other way
POV: you think this trailer was doctor strange 2<br>POV: you got click bait
Ancient One: How did you become a doctor?<br>Strange: Study practice , years a bit  <br>that&#39;s the secret of Sherlock
When will we get the trailer for part 2??
Doctor Fate is coming 🧙‍♂️.
All I see is sherlock
Who came here after thinking it was Doctor Strange 2
One of the best Marvel movies ever and best movies of 2016.
This movie is underrated
In MCU, where Sherlock is a doctor and John is a CIA agent
Strange: How I go from here to there<br>Ancient One: How did you become a doctor<br>Strange: Study practice , years a bit <br>Anciet One: that emotion
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness comes out exactly a year from now on March 25, 2022...<br>I&#39;ll come back here after a year.
“What’s this? My Mantra?” <br>“The WiFi password... We’re not savages.”
Benedict Cumberbatch was made for this role
We should have a Dr Strange 2 🎞 🎥 already!!
The wifi password 🤣🤣
Doctor straaaaange
is it just me or does Dr Strange have a bit of a weird head  seethrough glitch? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=112">1:52</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=114">1:54</a>
Eagerly waiting for the sequel💞
💕💓
A sorcerer is a wizard without hat...
Doctor strange when he realized that 15 year old kid going to finishes his trilogy before you get second part :(
Imagine if Joaquin Phoenix said yes to this role....
Cool
Plz plz give us just first look of Doctor Strange 2 🙏
The most underrated MC movie. Can&#39;t wait for the sequel... Doctor Strange is a complex character, his sarcasm has the roots in its intelligence and there&#39;s so much &#39;material&#39; that the screenwriters and the director can play with - hopefully they will know how to do it...
Damnit I thought this was the Doctor Strange 2 trailer. Read too fast
Imagine if Dr. Strange is a stand alone film and in the ending plot twist is that the ancient one put hallucinogen in his tea in the beginning.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=107">1:47</a> it gives me chills every time
We are waitin for Doctor Strange 2 Trailer
Dr Strange will be future tech for Power of subconcious mind and Silva Mind Control Techniques Like Iron man was future for tech like Android and ipads
It still looks so cool.
Doctor strange knew that corona was coming and just wear a mask to warn us
Who is here after<br>Who is here before <br>Fcuk stop it
who else is watching after wandavision finale?
Anyone here after wanda vision
evil dude: i am death...*dramatic pause* pain!<br>me: i am hungry
Who is here after last episode of Wanda vision. It is finally revealed who is stronger sorcerer.
I thought this was the trailer of doctor strange 2😭
too bad the ancient one is whitewashed
the visuals of this movie are severely underrated
Like Iron man was future for tech like Android and ipads, Dr Strange will be future tech for Power of subconcious mind and Silva Mind Control Techniques
the undertitles are a disgrace
&quot;Strange is meant to be the best of us&quot;
This is fake it’s just the last movie 😭
The greatest movie in the history of humanity
Doctor strange trailer: only 200k likes<br><br>Doctor strange 2 trailer when released: 2MILLION LIKES
One of the best trailers ever made !
Okay i catch you watching this in 2021, why?
How did you become a doctor?<br>Study and Practice.. Years of it
marvellous film i saw it
The most beautiful movie he had ever seen
it&#39;s a good thing dr strange became a superhero; his sterile technique is appalling
Doctor Strange movie is like Harry Potter and Inception
In 2021🔥😍
Yer a wizard, Stephen
Now waiting for 2
Waiting for movie
Just keep the number 2 after the word &#39;strange&#39; then you the title will be Doctor strange 2 official trailer😜
This is  Movie is  Still  amazing and Epic and  Soo I am Rewatching It  Tommrow  maybe

Because of the comics and cartoons this is one of the few marvel movies I really wanted to see because I love this character
when sherlock goes too deep in his mind palace
Wtf
My mind reading it <b>doctor strange 2 official trailer</b>
I’ve seen this movie sooooooo many times (it’s truly pathetic), but this is my first time watching the trailer 👁👄👁
My god this trailer was one of the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The first movie with a new Marvel Studios logo added with its’ customary movie themed design and animation ❤️❤️
For a moment , i thought that marvel released dr strange 2 trailer
Love BC
This Movie is Underrated!
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is my most anticipated movie!
Doutor stranger 1
Bro i honestly think Strange could beat Thanos
No encuentro la película solo veo trailers.
A petition for Cumberbatch&#39;s Doctor Strange to become the lead force of the MCU after RDJ&#39;s Iron-Man<br>Another petition for Holland&#39;s Spider-Man to become the leader of the Young Avengers
I come here time and again for the background music 😂 its so hypnotic
Rachels is back
Cuándo la integencia va más allá todo es posible

Youtube suggesting after 4 years 👏👏👋
Dystopian Music gives goosebumps everytime
Excellent shooting in Nepal
I thought this was the second movie trailer 🙄
You so
Today I just waake up and opened yt then this trailer was recomended. I&#39;m shock because I read it cuickly as Doctor Strange 2
Probably the worst marvel movie.
Thought this was the trailer for &quot;Doctor Strange 2&quot;
Kind of reminds me of the Matrix
The tinkle starting sound is pretty common in all marvel studios trailers
I thought it said- Doctor Strange 2 official trailer
When you find out the reality you live in has dumbasses that take movie clips to make a trailer 🤣🤣
I could have swore this was 2017 movie wow
Don&#39;t like every movie in the MCU but this film is one of my favourites.<br>Very underappreciated.<br>I certainly can&#39;t wait to see more of that darker mystical supernatural side of Marvel ( Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Blade, Hellstorm, Morbius, Mephisto. )since this was just the tip of the iceberg.
This is one of the most underrated MCU movies. But honestly this is a incredible movie with so much attention to detail I can watch this movie so many times and not dread nor dislike it shout-out Benedict and the other cast members for making such a great movie💯
While filming, Benedict Cumberbatch walked into a comic book store, in full costume, and bought an actual Doctor Strange comic.
Ok so I just read the title incorrectly and was fooled into watching the entire trailer in the hope that they&#39;re just giving a glimpse into doctor strange 1🤦🏻‍♀️
If he could see the future, he should have known that Endgame was coming the moment he inherited the time stone.
God dammit! This randomly popping up in my recommended I thought this said Doctor Strange 2 Trailer.
Still one of my favourite movies to this day..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=8">0:08</a> - in the movie he was just walking not drinking wine 😂 exactly pause there
Dr strange is going to join spiderman 3
Title : Dr. Strange Official Trailer 2<br><br>My eyes : Dr. Strange 2 Official Trailer

Still my favorite MCU origin movie!!
Fake
I prefer sherlock 100% better than this
Good movie.

Dr Strange:  i dont unerstand<br>The Ancient One: U SEE, BUT DO NOT OBSERVE<br><br>(Sherlock theme intensifies)
Is this inception II ?
We want all marvel movies available in the channel
&quot;Stronger men than you have lost their way.&quot; such an underrated line. 💪🏻
Batman fan, but favourite mcu charecter.

Proud to be Nepali🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
I love marvel
Best movie to see in IMAX 3D
2020?
So this is mystic inception batman ?
Dr strange is stronger than Captain marvel fight me
dubbing is bad in almost many countries in change of language. Just take an example<br>What&#39;s this<br>Wi-Fi password we are not savages but in hindi it&#39;s (I am translating to english) <br>Wifi password I also purchase some things online. 🤨🤨🤨🤨🧐🧐😒😒😒

He was just come for bargain.
It feels so good to know that they have mentioned Kathmandu and Nepal in this movie,so much excited for multiverse of madness
Year
Mister Doctor will now be seeing you today.
i loved that Lamborghini :&#39;(
The guy who composed the music in this trailer deserves a raise.
Love from nepal ...love to see places of nepal😍
Full movie
This is a revelation hidden and this WiFi password scene just covered up 3,000+ years of powerful secret ancient knowledge which was being explained prior to it.
🔮Google: Siddhi🔮
🔮Hidden in plain sight🔮
I don&#39;t know why Benedict&#39;s name hasn&#39;t ever come up when the Doctor Who&#39;s Series Regeneration is imminent. I think he&#39;d make an amazing Doctor. :-)
Ye poorana trailer hai
So you actually thought that this was Dr Strange 2 while scrolling down huh?!
Let&#39;s be honest you thought it was the 2nd movie of Doctor Strange, right?
One of the best movie of MCU.
Well looks like Sherlock and Irene Adler managed to sneak out in a separate Multiverse!!!
In my most humble opinion, this is one of the best MCU trailers.
There should be solo movie of Dr. Fate
They should have kept this theme music. The one they used in the movie is just a rehash of that composers Star Trek theme and not a good fit either.
I thought this was the second part of the movie trailer 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Still in my top 5 marvel movies
Man, I loved Bernardsdick Cabbagepatch&#39;s acting in this movie
Who are all thought that it is doctor strange 2 official trailer?
I&#39;m die hard DC fan but Dr.Strange is the only reason i love and respect Marvel.
in 2020 I come here to watch Doctor Strange Trailer.
Coincidentally it&#39;s Sherlock and Irene Adler!! 😊
I think they put a lot of effects while making the movie
Sher lock sheris acter
Hey they changed the Marvel Studios logo 😎.........
Proud seeing the Nepalese architecture 🤩🤩😎
Are these true in real life??
What are you doing Sherlock
No one knows that dormammu is also played by dr strange
Didn&#39;t like the film,but I adore the trailer. Especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=27">0:27</a>. When that music drops 🤤
In the trailer Mordo said There is no other way, in infinity war Doctor Strange said there was no other way 😱
anyone here after endgame
Everything is INCEPTION.
I don&#39;t know why YouTube recommend this trailer today, July 30, 2020. 😅
So this is where sherlock holmes went to
I am from Nepal. Namaste
This one of my favourite movies ever. It gives us a full origin story and explores the characters humanity
No matter how much I try I always see him as Sherlock irrespective of whatever character he is playing 😐.
what if nolan make a doctor strange movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=6">0:06</a> - actually that scene didn&#39;t come in the movie
Imagine Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Who......
Dr Strange really underrated character. Marvel made him weak in endgame. whereas he brought an army. a lot has happened thanks to him. He&#39;s 2nd Tony Stark .
Where is Wanda????
This movie goosebumps awesome<br>Whn will release part 2
Basically this film reminds me of Inception even though the comics were first
I&#39;m so excited
Literally the first movie
This is fan made???? Or no

Any comic book readers remember that Doc Strange started The Defenders. The biggest fight was 6 Finger Hand. The Avengers sidelined it.
No no movie

This is what Sherlock was doing while he was pretending to be dead
Doctor Strange
Mister Doctor: Into the multiverse of madness
When I saw doctor strange I was devastated to find out that Padme cheated on Anakin
I got this recommended and I actually thought it was the trailer for the second movie🤦‍♂️
Love from Nepal

Kaecilius and his followers disliked the video

Mads Mikkelsen the BEST!
Anyone who has visited Kamataj in Nepal ?
Sam Raimi&#39;s movie may be Toby Return (Spider Man)
The movie that made me appreciate the beauty of IMAX
How many of you are waiting for Doctor strange 2??...

Is that Wong his fateful servant?
Why did I go “woah it’s Sherlock!” 🤣
What’s up with Rachel having this obsession with Sherlocks
Kinda cool how a channel gets so many subs by just making trailers.
Doctor Strange will always be the best solo movie of MCU and you can&#39;t change my mind.
What a trailer.. What a movie ✌
If I could be any avenger I would be tony stark or doctor strange

Can you please make a movie of the sorcerer supreme? It really makes me sad to know that she died on this movie &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. I like the Sorcerer Supreme more that i like doctor strange. She&#39;s really cool.

The only doctor who can save us from Corona Virus 🤣

It&#39;s totally copy of Hinduism here Shambhala is a place where kalki avatar will born in future at the end of Kalyug...
Best Avenger is Caption America and Thor &amp; Iron man
The qualities of drama, but also great humor amongst that profundity and oddness, and unique weirdness and newness that they are gonna bring visually, put the hero thing on the back burner.
This is one of the coolest movies and trailers I&#39;ve seen this movie made me love dr strange he is highly underrated this movie made me read his comics

Can’t wait for doctor strange 2
I don’t think I’ve ever been so impressed with a trailer before. I regret not having watched it in theatre but definitely will on the VR headset!
Its 2020! Still cooooooolll.....🥶🥶🔥🔥🔥
Doctor Strange  is my favourite movie,  and  don&#39;t loose Doctor Starenge 2:  In the Multiverse Of Madness my don&#39;t release yet but i sense my favourite because all of these multiverse think i like it very much thanks Marvel Studios for these movies that we bringing us and thanks for the movies that we will bringing us in to the fuure whitch Doctor Strange 2 and  Thor 4:  Love and Thunder
İt is fake.

I’m too poor to watch every avenger movies there are like 10 movies to watch for me and in 2021 will be like another 10 movies like 😳 my money
🔥 <br> Love this movie. <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=110">1:50</a> 🎥🔥 <br>  👇 👇 👇💚
is that jessica chastain or jeniffer garner or rachel mcadams..they all look alike
After this film, I fell in love with this character. Doctor Strange became one of my favorite Avengers.
It would seem more appropriate that the Sorcerer Supreme would have the Reality Gem in general, but I understand why they went with Time for the purpose of the story in this and other MCU films.
Who else clicked on this thinking it said Doctor Strange 2 Official Trailer
Came for doctor stang
this movie is sooooo underated
Who thought just by the thumbnail this video was doctor strange 2?
Very good

I was one of the lucky thousands to witness this trailer at SDCC 2016 and i gotta tell you.. the hype was REAL!!! The music, the acting, the magic, everything about this movie got me pumped!!! and now since the movie came out, this trailer still gives me goosebumps!! 😍😍😍

....How did you become a doctor?...&quot;study and practice&quot;...
I came a long way...
Who is here after endgame .
I clicked &quot;Doctor strange 2 official trailer&quot; but no,,this is different.
Still feels like yesterday. There was no other good movie release that week so me and my friends just went to see it just to pass some time. But here we  were screaming and hooting mindlessly while watching it.
Certainly the 2nd best origin story film within the MCU after Captain America the first Avenger.
Great trailer - suuuuuch a bad film
Still watching it because of the music 😅
Waiting for the second movie
Where is Sherlock in this movie
He is still searching for his BB...
The hairs at the back of my neck are standing after seeing this.<br>Epic😍
For me this will be the best MCU movie ever, even after Endgame.
Why did I thought this was doctor strange 2 trailer😴
I thought this is the Doctor Strange 2 trailer.

Everyone says Thor, Iron man, Captain Marvel, etc., but this man fights with non-physical things if they saw the comics they would know that he is extraordinary and that in the movies they do not show everything.
Seems like a long time ago
If you guys are curious what comments were written before the newer ones, well people years ago were having a theory that Strange may have the Time Stone and turned out it&#39;s true.
Dr. Strange is Kalki of marvel
Just came here for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=106">1:46</a> 🙆

I love coming back to this. Reminiscing on how I felt, the excitement, the curiosity, the amazement I felt.<br>I remember the music in the beginning fitting soo well with the mysticism that is Dr. Strange.<br><br>This was a great movie, and I absolutely cannot wait for Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.
Who else waiting for dr.stange 2 ?

I went to see this movie while high back when it came out and man what an experience. One of my favorite Marvel movies. Changed my life.

Who r those 8k idiots who disliked this trailer ? Go get a life 😡
I love his power so elegant and discret... Interesting
This is still one of the dopest trailers ive ever seen
Me watching the first trailer: I bet this’ll be an awesome MCU film! <br>Me watching the second trailer: Were the creators on drugs?<br>Me watching the movie: Nope, /I’m/ on drugs.
At first I thought this was doctor strange part 2

Proud to be an Hindu..💪👈
There making a 2nd movie but this is not the trailer this is the 1st one
This is not the new one, it&#39;s old one.
Awesome! I loved the movie&#39;s ambient, it truly takes me out of this world. I hope the sequel  have a similar feeling with more practical effects👍🏻
The most super powerful avenger. ...<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>Scarlet Witch 😈😈
the film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe is just fire, I wish everyone to see the graphics, the acting is just fine.
that too bad
Shamballa
There is/was no other way, so Strange stole Mordo&#39;s line.
I am sorry Tony... there was no other way.
FAKEEEEEEEE
<b>Doctor strange movie &amp; STORY Different compared to Remaining MCU movies</b> 😂😂😂
Did Dr.Strange got power coming to Nepal?<br>I am from Nepal that means I too can have that power hummm.
SOOOO hyped for Multiverse of madness 😍😍😍😍❤️
Just came into my recommendations, thought it was for Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness 😭😭😭
CANT WAIT DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS
Now he doing for living?
I don&#39;t know when Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness is coming out, but I can&#39;t find 1 real Trailer that shows it. My guess is 1- Their building the hype after making so much $$$$$ from End Game. 2- They just don&#39;t have enough film in the can to make a trailer. One thing seems to be certain. It&#39;s defiantly coming out next summer or the following summer (It&#39;s gotta be a summer release to get the high Box Office sales). Either way, I&#39;m looking forward to it.. :)

I misread the title. I got this in my recommended in 2019. I expected Doctor Strange 2
Why in the actual heck would Marvel recommend me this right now and make me think the title said Doctor Strange 2?

When I saw the trailer it felt like 2018 not 2016 bro wtf my sister was not 1 yr old when I saw this trailer
Anybody realize that after Endgame, Doctor Strange will not have a Time Stone...<br>&quot;Our oath to protect the stone doesn&#39;t change&quot;
So Ready For The Sequel And Hulk Better Be In It Or Scarlet Witch One Of The 2!!!
where cumberbitches at?
La mejor película.... Dr. Strange
It&#39;s my fav character
Wow Regina George helps other now, that’s great.
The only serious movie that Marvel has, love Dr Strange!
In this trailer there is something wrong in these scene. Doctor strange is doing a surgery and scrubs his hand and then puts his mask. That is wrong. You cannot put mask after you scrub your hands. You have to put your mask before scrubbing or somebody puts on your mask. Mask are not sterile.
&quot;Dr. Strange you think you know how the world works, what if I told you the reality you know is one of many&quot;...<br><br>Dr. Strange: this doesn&#39;t make any sense<br><br>SS: &quot;Not everything does, not everything has too&quot;❤️
Says we are not savages but gave the most Savage reply as wifi password.
Who else clicked on this video thinking they were gonna watch the sequel for doctor strange?
“Dormammu, I’ve come to bargain”

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzx-zryEgM&amp;t=27">0:27</a> why this is not in the movie?
“I can’t do this” <br>*Some time later<br>*trys to kill thanos
of all the scenes in this trailer, and marvel chose the current thumbnail....
This movie is sooo darn underrated. Benedict’s performance, the visual effects, the set pieces and action scenes...superb movie. Saw it a few days ago and fell in love with it.
