<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=315">5:15</a> - pewds on grind
This gonna be sad when he quits
yagga
For the past 4 years of watching Pewds, hes becoming more mature in life and Im so happy for it 🤗✌️
Crazy times 🤣🤣
POV: You were looking through YouTube search to see if anybody made a video on him, for leaving YouTube right before 2022.
Test
Pewdiepie: eats food<br><br>Media: &quot;He is protesting against world hunger&quot;
MR BEEEAST ……. ninja?… ok
this so sad after watching his videos every week and realising that he has quit youtube
Poppy: SimplyNailogical is kids channel.<br>Me: Beeeeeeeen! Explain plz.
You shouldn&#39;t ever have to announce that you are taking a break, you should just vanish. You do you. I may have roasted you by calling you trash, but it was sarcastic gaming trolling attitude. At least you responded properly by wearing a trash bag.
PewDiePie: tiktok is stupid<br>Media: PewDiePie says he is gonna destroy tiktok<br>And makes racist jokes on tiktok&#39;s ceo
👁️👄👁️
Nice intro😂
It’s not unusual for theory’s to go around
Very good video ever YouTube
Pewdiepie 110million +395000
Over all these years, felix has seen so much of media bullshit. I feel bad for him that  people don&#39;t actually understand how great of a guy he is.

Pew news back pls
I’m big fan but omg  😱 this is sooo sad 😞🙁😓😭
That Beanie is so cute.
I love how swedish he is with accepting awards, he is so humble which you can tell because he is swedish. The most terrifying thing you can do to a swedish person is treat them differently than everyone else by praising their work. You can see how it makes them uncomfortable. I love it
Apoostroph🤣
He legitimately said apistrofy
WHERE ARE YOU NOW QUESTION MARK?<br>WHY DID YOU LEAVE NOW?
Mr Beast f-ing planted 20 mil trees and broke 13 world records,, Pewds literally had made 20 millions subs in 4 months, and the Creator of the Year goes to someone who promotes drugs.
Wow its so sad that pewdiepie quit
I like your beanie.
Legend entrance too 👍😂
Noo
I don&#39;t like tana very much
This why I don&#39;t believe anything the news says about Trump.
:(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=385">6:25</a> I thought the second one said beat Edgar
Is it weird I&#39;m watching this almost a year later when this is all irrelevant?
Don’t you hate fake comments. Like, my mom quit her job and we are now living on the streets because of fake comments. We are eating dead rats because of fake comments
Piggy pies is the square
bruh this is from a while ago but when this happened my dad got upset when he thought u were leaving LMAO
Did
Gus Johnson should put that face on all of his thumbnails
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=120">2:00</a> aren&#39;t you Poppy smoria
adderall is prescription cocaine so creator of the year is a Coke head that’s real nice
Hey, Wait.  I just realized something.  Pewdie likes to talk about himself!
pewdie bye. That’s very rude to the worlds greatest Youtuber.
pew: i am taking bath.<br>media: pew is Drowning
As a boy I can confirm, we do have testicles
Y
And it’s just a yt
It’s okay he wasn’t quitting forever he just needs some break
Pewdiepie:has hair<br>Media:Pewdiepie is making fun of people with cancer?!?!
Did I just see a galaxy fold here? HMMMMMMMMM.
I saw ur vid on kreekcraft sub thing or whatever
so if pewdiepie was hypothetically black  or any other race besides white would the media see him in a positive or negative way?
Pew news has joined the chat.
Felix: <b>Exists</b><br><br>Media: <b>He&#39;s planning to take control of mars</b>
<b>APOSTROF</b>
Pewds : &quot;Cough Cough&quot;<br><br>Media : &quot;He is the source of Corona Virus.&quot;
pewdiepie: <b>breaths</b><br><br>Media: &quot;he is making fun of dead people&quot;
I like how kasey said just Tana as he didn’t knew how to pronounce mongese.
But you said your quitting?
Whaaaaaaat!
I really like how people make jokes about Markiplier being a child who laughs at his own poop jokes when Felix made a full on game about it 😂
Pewdiepie:drinks water<br><br>Media:he is mocking the thirsty
After watching the clip at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=768">12:48</a> <br>I think he should be in Passion gang.
News Update: Felix Kjellberg also known as ‘Pewdiepie’ states Youtube is closing down soon

lmao, going back to all the times media shit on him makes me laugh...
If it’s all wrong it becomes fact
Media: Pewdiepie, the guy that makes horror game reviews is quitting.
News Media Titles: Poppy Smoria mispronounced &#39;apostrophe&#39; App-o-strof THIS MEANS SHE&#39;S QUITTING YOUTUBE?!?!?!??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=517">8:37</a> OMG Lilly Singh, the brown bisexual women who&#39;s not at all an old white guy!?!?
Dont like this
Its true! Pewdiepie quit his job! All we see is Mary Ham!
Pewdiepie: <b>talks</b><br><br><br>Media: <b>Pewdiepie is makeing fun of mute people</b>
Fuchaka up
Does that mean ever video after this is actually poppy Harlow or Gloria Borger
Pewdiepie: <b>misses uploading for a day</b><br><br>Media: he did the dance of d e a t h
Felix: im gonna take a break.<br>The Virus: FBI OPEN UP!
Smply nail lojecol is not a kids&#39;s channel
Jess pretended to be me.
How did T-Series win against <b>God</b> ?
Yes im watching this in quarantine and yes I want to make my own articlebcos of the dum media.
I fucking love the irony
Pewdiepie why :(
Bring back pew news
People need to realize pewdiepie is given his money basically by the people so if someone has a problem, just no.
simplynailogical~<br>pewds: epic, a kids channel..<br><br>LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=235">3:55</a> Aper-stroph
MrBeast really deserved that award, but knowing him I don’t think he cares. He too knows it’s bullshit
Everyone&#39;s talking about Poppy Smoria and Mary Ham but what about Erin Burnett
&quot;The project is myself, i can&#39;t sell myself.&quot;<br><br><b>Are you sure about that?</b>
Alright guys let&#39;s be real these comments are pretty unoriginal.
Swedish man seeing what we all see in America

Your content sucks
What PewDiePie has Quit YouTube But who is making the vids
Dude just take a break you deserve it

Try bashin PewDiePie and get roasted n slapped by 100mil ppl

felix make a playthrough series of the game Figment
I miss old mr beast
Tana Mongoose pay to win creator of the year
Plot twist: Pewdiepie quit youtube but poppy smoria took over his channel and didn&#39;t change the channel name because she didn&#39;t want people to know that she&#39;s operating the pewdiepie channel.<br>Edit: i confused poppy gloria and poppy smoria together i am sorry for i have sinned.
This is incredible &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; actually sayed that he was over worked and that he was going to take break!!! This just Proves my point even More how USA is a piece of crap country
Pewdiepie:coughs😷<br><br>Media:pewdiepie has coronavirus <br><br>Who is watching in 2020
pewds has more integrity then trad. media =TRUTH
<b>MAMA awards triggered</b>
Pewds: blinks<br>Media: OMG GUYS HES GONNA DESTROY THE WORLD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=215">3:35</a> haha
pewdiepie: goes offline for 1 second<br>media: pewdiepie has quit youtube
pretty sure I hadn&#39;t even brushed my teeth every day in the past 10 years
The news that I will watch
This is why pew quit youtube<br><br><b>PEWDIE</b> bye
Pewdiepie- &quot;So I had this low quality version of this.&quot;<br>Ad- &quot;Damnit! How could this happen?&quot;<br>Skips rest of ad.<br>Pewdiepie- &quot;Cause they changed the title.&quot;
pewdiepie nooooooooo =[
no... nOT THE LIINKED IN
I would be so happy if you were quitting <i>YOUTUBE</i>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=632">10:32</a> why is this so wholesome
For three months, till today I thought pewds quit... Trump was right fake news everywhere
Marzia put a black magic spell on you. That&#39;s why you are still connected to me because we were made for each other. You came to me and said we were married. Ok I&#39;m going to say it  Jack Septic eye slept with her. The water Bottle Flip  one. In the beginning you went to the bathroom and he bragged about it. Then you shot him and went to jail. You went back in time and edited it. That is why Jack is still alive.  I was watching NASA&#39;s trip to the moon. That might help you.
This is a quick interpretation of how the “ news” are willing to go so damn low, jeez
&#39;pewdiepie farts&#39;<br><br>media: he&#39;s maKIngg fuUn oOf PEoPLe wiTH dIorREA
He obviously just wanted the money
Pewdiepie: <b>still alive</b><br>News: He&#39;s making fun of dead people
Pew News : The Real News
RIP
H
P
I want him to say &quot;apostrophe&quot; 10 times in a row.
I am VERY IMPRESSED That PewDiePie Actually Has 103M Subscribers and is the Most Popular YouTuber Ever. If You Think About It, Theres 7B People In The World and 100M is Like a 10th of 1B. Hopefully That Makes Sense.
मा चुदाये फुद्दीपाई.
Uhh ummmm... i don&#39;t feel so good
When you are joking but the fact isn&#39;t a joke anymore<br>Please come back to your fan<br>They need you!
I found where all the stupid people come
And then he took a break....
Now I realize he really quit :&#39;(
It&#39;s okay buddy. You don&#39;t need to explain yourself. I know. I created you. It&#39;s me god. Stop being a pussie and enjoy yourself. You&#39;re fans will be right here waiting.
Bro
Pewdiepie: <b>*breathes*</b><br><br>Media: PewDiePie <b>STEALING</b> the Earth&#39;s oxygen
Maybe they were just broadcasting a couple of months into the future
Pew: Kills stuff animal<br><br>Media: OMG PEWDS HAS BEEN AN ANIMAL ASSAULTER ALL THIS TIME
Safiya is AWESOME! talk about someone who does her reaserch!
Instead of saying you&#39;re taking a break you should say &quot;IM GOING ON VACAY!!!&quot;
Why is this guy popular?
U really QUIT You tude l love uuuuuu ur the star of you tude 🙁🙁🙁🙁realy😩
Po
1 month later
I think it&#39;s beacause of &quot;&quot;&quot;his lovely wife&quot;&quot;&quot;
But its real on 2020
2020 is officially the worst year ever
This did not age well...
I think they were true
Pewdiepie: <b>gets flu</b><br><br><br>Media: pewdiepie has corona virus 🦠
You suck now you gave up your crown
And now 😢😢 it&#39;s true.
So racist! u want everyone to earn their profits from dlive, and try to make this world connected with tron and bittorrent! Best thing u could ever have done! last time i use youtube!
F
Fun fact, yellow journalism (fake news) was invented by Benjamin Franklin, to win more support for the revolutionary war of the united states of america against the British. Yes, dude did invent some crazy schmech in his life, including that.
How long will his break be?
Pewdipie reaction be like: <b>Whats happening to thiz people</b>
Cannabis is legal in CA. As is prescription Adderall. <br><br>But you are right. I don’t know why young people think drugs are ‘cool’. If you’re gonna use legal things, just do it without the need to brag. Coz so many people do it. It’s nothing. It’s boring.
Whos watching when he acutually quits youtube
Pewdiepie: Im taking a break<br>Poppy Smoria: Pewdiepie is taking a break<br>Media: Racist, Antisemite Pewdiepie quits Yuotube.
I just liked how straightforward and honest he was about that Tanna thing. He straight up said he hated her without caring about what others might think or what she might&#39;ve said. I 💯% liked and appreciated that tbh.
The news and media rarely attacks these celebrity drug promoters but always attacks the gamers who are not even a sliver close to as bad.

BREAKING NEWS PEWDIEPIE IS GOING TO SELL HIS CHANNEL
The Last video of Pewdiepie &quot;its been real,but im out&quot;<br>T-series:Yes hahaha

Sorry if you actually quit
I hope you will have a great reast thank you for making us lugh i hope you will have a great time in japan with your family and god bless you i hope you will have a safe trip😊
This is very good news.
To create the world you want to live in, you need to stick up for the people you believe in. I really dislike when the media tries to tear Pewdiepie down. I&#39;m not a super fan and don&#39;t watch every video he puts out, but I will stick up for him if others try to bring him down.
Just don’t leave
Pliz come back
Pewdiepie: this is bullshit
well im happy that poods take a break, because theres still a lot of videos that i need to catch up😂😂😂 not to mention, there r still videos in the past yrs that i havent watch
you&#39;re betraying your subscribers why are you doing this
But its real now :(
Pewds no
Calvo
I love how pewds just casually exposes Tana lol
Media är riktigt vinklade i dagens läge........
Youtube feels so lonely without pewdiepie

<b>laughs in present day</b>

Nooooooooo
Meanwhile: pewdiepie quits all media for real
NOoOooOoOooOoOoOoOoOoOoOooOoOoOooOoooOooOoOO
Definition of fake news. Wow I hate the world.
Pewdiepie: <b>Drinks water</b><br><br>Media: He&#39;s bullying people who are dying of thirst<br><br><br>Me: <b>drinks water</b><br><br>My teacher: PUT THAT BACK IN YOUR BACKPACK!
Nah he ain’t, he just taking a break
The truth that pewdiepie is quitting YouTube because of terms of service
Pewdiepie: <b>dies</b><br>Media: He&#39;s making fun of alive people
I quit being alive
I was on my google page just searching up dog videos i go back twice and i see a picture of Felix and it says &quot;pewdiepie the king of YouTube has joked about running out of ideas and quiting youtube, its good to see hes taking that joke seriously&quot; i flipped out! And that lead me to watching this video, im so glad that hes not
Plz dont quit
Ever
Good now dont come back
Felix, we understand. If you need to take a break we get it. You need time for yourself. Everyone needs a bit of me time. If you need to then you can take a break. Take as long as you want we understand take time off spend time with Marzia we will be alright. So take a month off we will be fine. We understand
Honestly did we really expect anything else from the media
It is just a break right ?
You will post again right ? Please don&#39;t stop posting i just started watching you and i love it.
News must be embarrassed
Pewdiepie: gets on plane to go on holiday <br><br>News media: Felix is planing 9/11 two
Man, this Poppy Smoria person really reminds me of PewDiePie. :&#39;(
Pewdie I’m out
Sorry you have to burden this crap pewds. Never mind. 100 million people have your back. Not to mention Marzia ☺️
Clearly pewds has never seen simplys channel lmao
Pewdiepie: Sleep<br>Media: Pewdiepie is dead in 2020
So this were it ends
The streamy awards hold absolutely no value. Especially after Tana winning ANY award, much less greater of the year
It was one of the main headline on the news channel for me XD
are we just going to ignore the was he said apostrophe
Pewdiepie:“I am really sad.”<br>Also pewdiepie:*laughs*
Everytime he speaks in swedish accent he making fun of Greta Thunberg
I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re the most subscribed person on youtube. I can&#39;t imagine if another &quot;creator&quot; had 100mln subscribers, I understand it&#39;s really difficult for you but really I thank you for being so modest and an example for everybody. Stay strong Felix
I hate how the media cant take a joke, neither can half of the internet
Good on you! Screw everyone else take time for you. We love you Pewds! End of the last video was better too. Can&#39;t believe the hype
People that don’t watch your videos and still see those news places will believe it all
With Awards It&#39;s like in IT industry ... you want your startup to be funded... move your startup to States. Simple, boohaaa!
Love comments! So true!!!
Had such a good laugh!!! A joke... all that media crap :D but still fun if you have head on your shoulders :)
How did you just say apostrophe?😂
When you realise beating the enderdragon is on the same level as getting 100 mil subs and getting married
that beanie tho
Why would pewds take a break from linkedin😭😭 this is so sad
I ate food
Pewdiepie: <b>Literally doing nothing but existing</b><br><br>Media: <b>He&#39;S mAkInG fUn Of PeOpLe ThAt DoN&#39;t ExIsT</b>
PewDiePie showed me that I could lose myself if I were to be a successful YouTuber due to this constant media involvement.
whats the fan password, i forgot.
brofist dont let go!!!!!
This comment section is so supportive
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=649">10:49</a> WTF does that even mean?
During the break they&#39;re going to say he died or he had a child
<b>And that is why Pew New is the most reliable News Source on the planet!</b>
pewdiepie feed your parrots a cookie they will breed &gt;.&lt;
why do they all use the same 3 pictures of pewdiepie for their articles
Pewdiepie we love you dont quit
Pewdiepie: blinks<br>Media: omg write that down did you get that did you get that<br>Media again: how can we make this fictional?
Lies no quit
pewdiepie: breathes<br><br>media: ok so he has like 5 minutes to live
No shit we know, thanks for the fake news exposure broseph!
OMG! He uses the Galaxy fold, bruhhh
I hate myself for thinking this was real
Simply nailogical isn’t a child’s channel just making that clear 😁😊
Big Brain moment<br>Pewdiepie is taking a break to escape from January memes
I hope he doesn’t quit MySpace 😢
I have a question. Where did all the Minecraft videos go??
Literal proof that cnn is fake news.
Putting out a video every day for years without stop definitely warrants a break. He has earned it.
Guys, I’m heartbroken<br>Why is he quitting 😔
Aw, man. You have a loyal enough fandom that you can take 6 months off, come back and your fans will die of happiness. Take a break, rest, travel, enjoy Marzia and the rest of the family, discover new things you like doing, go out there!!!! Enjoy YOUR life. YOURS! Real fans don&#39;t read or care about bullshit media crap. Real fans want your happiness! You gave us 1736363662 videos that made us happy and distracted us from our miserable lives. You don&#39;t even have to explain anything! We&#39;re not your boss, this is not an office. Youtuber aren&#39;t granted sick days, bad days, vacation days. So you&#39;re the one that need to realize when your mind and body needs rest. So go, have fun, have another honeymoon ❤ Marzia knew when she needed to take care of herself and was like &quot;i&#39;m out&quot;, that was incredibly brave. Take it from her and leave for as long as you feel you need. You have money, that&#39;s not a problem, so you can focus on actually using it for things you wanna do, maybe even new projects you were postponing, or just simply rest your mind. Also take it from someone who spent 5 years 100% focused on work and used the money i made to go back and forth from work and eat after work cause I was too tired to cook. Like it or not, this is a job now. But so much different. In an office you don&#39;t need to read hate comments every day, gossips about you, have to smile when you don&#39;t feel like it. Entertaining is so stressful, it takes so much energy to enjoy thing when you have eyes on you all the time. Not that is a bad job at all! I&#39;m sure you love it and your fans! But everyone needs a rest every once in a while. You go, those who really care about you will wait ^•^
Pewdiepie: I’m tired<br><br>News: pewdiepie is qUitiNg
PewDiePie: I’m gonna take break<br>News Channels: So you choose... death?
&#39;I can&#39;t sell myself&#39;.....are you sure<br>I think your fans would love that
pewds flexing his galaxy fold
Felix: Don&#39;t hit me, i&#39;m swedish.<br><br><br>Media: PewDiePie, racist to all countries exept for sweden.
Pewdiepie if you are going to quit YouTube  don&#39;t  tell jimmy
It&#39;s not unheard of for celebrities to get targeted by tabloids for any mundane thing they do - like Pewds, who&#39;s basically just taking some time off of his full-time job.<br><br>What&#39;s really sad is how many news outlets have essentially turned into tabloids.  They don&#39;t actually tell the news anymore; they fabricate stories for profit instead.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=770">12:50</a> but pewds, she’s all quirky and different. Don’t you get that it’s because she’s quirky and different, guys it’s because she’s so quirky. Can you see how quirky she is
PewDiePie : Has a lot of subscribers<br><br><br><br>Media : He has an affair
There are Youtube awards? This is ridiculous
So like Simply Nailogical is a kids channel now?😂😂 didn’t get the memo
Remember kids, PewDie-Bye doesn&#39;t exist in Youtube!
I think it&#39;s because your old video
I was way too distracted by the face on the beanie
Hiatus guys
Best Pew News I&#39;ve watched so far.
YouTube ad: You have a business!<br>Me: no the frick I don&#39;t
You didn&#39;t quit YouTube
Why I love him
Simplynailogical<br>‘Epic a kids channel’<br>Felix, you sure about that?
Pewds : has a child<br>Media : (you got any idea to comment here, gamers?)
Pewds : married<br>Media : youtube most subscribed finally end his carreer as &quot;youtuber&quot;.
Pewds : brofist<br>Media : youtube biggest star, begin the hateful expression by showing a fist to the screen.<br>Pewds be like:<br><br><br>&quot;goddamnit.
Pewdiepie: eats pant<br>Media: pewdiepie is making fun of people that have pants
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=161">2:41</a> lol
Felix you&#39;re the 2nd Most Handsome Person on Earth! Congrats you handsome person.
Pewds sounds like he was about to cry😢😢😢
Everyone deserves a break Pewds 🙏🏼😌
It&#39;s not an a-po-strof it&#39;s an a-po-stro-fee
PewDiePie should make a podcast 😂
PhillyD and Pewds both. Gon be a quiet January
These outlets do know that he knows these exist right?
are u actually
Pewds: coughs<br><br>Media: PewDiePie has lung cancer
Lmaooo apparently the media really wants you to get off YouTube. 😂😂😂 They be like: &quot;if we say he is quitting, maybe he will actually quit 🤔&quot; <br>Idiots lmaooo
OMG I&#39;m laughing so hard! when he saw simply nail logical and said &quot;epic a kids chanel&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=556">9:16</a>
Media: Pewdiepie backtracks quiting youtube statement after receiving backlash
Lol freaking mainstream media they always have to spin stuff and get everything wrong while doing it.  Their job is to inform us, but they disinform us instead.
Felix I’m a heartbroken fan this is so sad
Wait they have awards for this sort of thing now? It really has gone corporate. No wonder the soul has been sucked out
I don’t know where I’ve been because I live in London and haven’t seen all this media talking about Pew Di pie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=494">8:14</a> <b>my favorite</b>
ik that tana is an addict and that’s like. a real struggle yknow? i’m not out here shaming anyone for being an addict. but don’t promote taking drugs, especially not to young kids, and ESPECIALLY NOT ADDERALL!!! weed isn’t all that bad but adderall can kill you AND it makes it harder for people like me who have adhd to get our fucking medicine, which we ACTUALLY NEED. if you’re addicted youre addicted (and you should be getting help but w/e) just don’t promote that shit to kids
Im in belgium and they say it on tv
Pewds: Says he is having a kid.<br>The media: He&#39;s planning on murdering his grandma
Tana mongooooooose
This shit was on the news lmao but at least they told the truth and not a blown up version of it
Just watched an add you get pewds some paper paper
Try BitLife please pewdiepie.
Me in the audience if I was there<br><br>Plays idubbz
Coppa
Bro we understand!! Sometimes you have to TAKE CARE of tour WIFE too you know!! We&#39;re just here for you guys! But seriously, we support you both. 👊

Rip
I have ADHD and I have to take medicine and for people like ran a to just take it to take it genuinely makes me mad
Im a European that does not watch the news.<br><br><i>So this is very new...</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Also i need that beanie
Pewds: Blinks<br><br>Media: PewDiePie causes the collapse of space and time after blinking with two eyes
Felix, Simplynailogical is not a kid channel, the video that they showen was just a collab with a kid from another youtuber
NOOO!
Pewdiepie: “wakes up”<br><br><br>Media:” Pewdiepie makes fun of dead people”
Pewds has been supplying us with quality content and memes he deserves a break just not to long 🥺😂
@PewDiePie , this video is my first time ever watching one of your videos or content. One question, is That a shirt of the old school hardcore punk/thrash band Heresy ? If so you just made me very proud of you &amp; I’ll fuck with ya, <br>~FiVEL~
I don&#39;t understand what actually is the point of these creator awards when you know that the most relevant ones win.
Pewdiepie: Makes a Video during his “break”<br><br>Media: Wait no, that’s not how you play the game!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=398">6:38</a> PewDiePie&#39;s a liar, vlogger confirmed 😀
Did pewds just call simplynailogical a kids channel? Wow, he has small pp
My man&#39;s taking a vacation from his job and people are having a meltdown like he is quitting his job. Lmao people are pathetic.
It was also reported on zee news in India too
Lowkey while Felix is on his break I kinda want him to change his name from “Pewdiepie” to “Poppy Smoria” while he’s gone so when he changes it back we can be excited for his return.
Pewdiepie: <b>Breathes</b><br><br><br><br><br>The media: He took our oxygen
Plss dont quit who is gonna give peace in YT
when you running out of ideas
Nailogical is not a kids channel
This Shit Was Scary Yo!
:O
Pewdiepie: Stands<br><br>Media: YouTube vlogger Pewdiepie making fun of people with paralysis, people without legs, people without the ability to walk, and babies!
Ap-ost-tro-PHEE 👍
NOOOOO PEWDS :(( please don’t quit, I love your videos, I’m so sad and heartbroken :( :( :(  I will dearly miss you
yeet
I sigh to this, I sigh to that, damn you fake news
I am sorry great emperor but I have just found out that you are no longer the great emperor of YouTube T-series has over thrown you <br><br>               Pewdiepie <br><br>                  👑 <br>               T-series
Hey, if ur reading this comment, then you probably can read, good stuff.
At least you didn&#39;t &quot;die&quot; like Jackcepticeye
does everyone else also say &#39;apostrof&#39; when saying apostrophe?. Imma start using that.
When I first heard the news a few things came to mind one was that you were tired you had been uploading for years dealing with attacks from everyone and had broken record after record and figured you may just want some time to relax and spend time with marzia and settle into the married life so spend some time away from YouTube and do what you need to do for you
What’s the Song in the background
i taking a break from snapchat 💀💀
Yup and I&#39;m from Ireland 🇮🇪
Mr Beast 😍
Racism is so exhausting. Felix deserves a break!
I wish people were not that stupid :)
Pewdiepie, definition of a legitimate human being. Much love xx
How does CNN always find a way to put racism in everything they write
Ok T-Series waste but why did you tease India
Im actually really sad to hear that news before your video cause im used to your video and + why did you deleted your Twitter account im just crying right now 😭😭😭😭😭
r.i.p zoomers
Pewdiepie: stands media: he is making fun of disabled people
Pewds is Giorno all along (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=767">12:47</a> ).
Comment: <b>posts pewdiepie vs media format</b><br>Everyone: &quot;well #$%! %$#!@ why didn&#39;t you say so?&quot;
I just choked for like 30 sec When i saw gus lol
Pewds: Yare Yare Daze<br>Media: he speaks Japanese and <b>he&#39;s</b> wants a break from living.
When pewds says he is quitting YouTube <br>But it was Poppy Simoria 😏
I feel bad for you😔, fans understand why you would take a break, a video a day can be a lot of work, take a break and live a life for a little
lazerbeam is better
Deep down this dude has always been humble and tons of people basically give him shit for being real.
I am ssssssaaaaaadddddd
Everyone hates CNN, its a joke
Pewdiepie: <b>*stands up*</b><br>The Media: HE’s MAkING fUn Of PeOplE wiTh nO lEgS!<br>9-year olds: <b>Wait-</b>
Pewdiepie: <b>*speaks*</b><br>Media: He’S mAkiNG fUn oF mUTe pEOplE!

And people wonder why we do not trust the media anymore.
simply nailogical...a kids channel?
So all the complaining boomers don’t know what leave is?
BREAKING NEWS: Pewdipie is SELLING HIMSELF
Honestly I was really pissed off when Mr. Beast didn’t win I don’t understand why it was tana
Who watches PewDiePie mostly just for his accent?
A p o s t r o p h e
Yes you deserve a break
rip : l
I hope young people realize just how badly the Main Stream Media cannot be trusted.
PewDiePie: posts a video<br><br>The media: PewDiePie is CLOGGING YouTube’s system

Take a break man. You&#39;ve worked a long time without a break.
Let’s face it. The media is just a bunch of boomers trying to shut down the media
Tana mongeau is the Billie eilish of youtube
Pewdiepie: not playing <br>Media:he&#39;s making fun of kids
I’m your 6.2 millionth view

Bruh....
Pewdiepie : shaking his head<br><br>Media : pewdiepie is making fun of those who has no head
I want pewds to be my grandpa. He has a lot of wisdom and facts.
PEWDIEPIE SAYS HE IS GOING TO JUMP OFF A CLIFF<br>HE SAID HE HAS BEEN HAVING CONVULSIONS<br>AN ERA HAS ENDED<br>HE HATES JEWS TOO AND POSSIBLY BLACK PEOPLE<br>HE IS JOINING THE DEEPSTATE
So my mom hates you because she says you hate Jewish people. Is this true?
Pewdz: I am not a vlogger <b>I vlogged the honeymoon</b>
I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t stand David Dobrik. Mr. Beast is cool for everything he&#39;s done. I love Safiya, and Simply. I&#39;m ok with Tana. Award Shows are just famous people giving themselves awards. 😂
So everyone forgot TanaCon huh
Not watching pewds recent vids starting last week so that i can watch him while hes away without being repetitive<br><b>big brain awakened</b>
Tyron Woodley entered the chat:<br>&quot;RACIST&quot;.
Will you still be on Myspace
Pewdiepie: calmly explains everything<br>NEWS MEDIA: IS PEWDIEPIE SELLING HIS CHANNEL
&quot;why do i have more integrity than news media&quot;
Wefere News?
Guess what my sister doesnt respect Mr.Beast
2020: PewDiePie quits<br><br>2021: PewDiePie&quot;Everybody meet Felix Jr.&quot;
Pewdiepie: doesn’t have AirPods<br>Media: making fun of people in wheelchairs
fresh 9yolds actually can learn a lot from pewnews, they know pewds content, they know pewds, also they can see the controversies in the media. In my opinion one of the best examples that TV, newpapers, or whatever aren&#39;t always right nor rightful. They can see it with their own eyes and proof it wrong. That&#39;s a lesson many of us old folks learned much later, or haven&#39;t even learned yet.
YouTube should advertise the voting but in a way like “ bot for ur fav creator without any biased based on ur subscriptions”
where did he get that cute ass beanie though is the real question
Pewds this was even on belgian news
You should think about yourself - it&#39;s your life :). If it&#39;s time to change you go and do it. Love to you! xxx
Haha bra
Meesa watcha Pewds peepee through webcam hack
R.I.P  !! PIMPP<br>Frm Loots Of Love Frm India ,🇮🇳<br>May Your Soul&#39; Rest In Heel !!
HOW COULD HE BREAK?!
But...nothing CNN said was untrue? Of course he can go after low budget internet tabloids and the &quot;news media&quot;
Why is everyone freaking out too, if he wants to take a break let him. He makes a video every single day and then has to deal with shit like this.
Its just like taking leave guys come on please be smart
Wow Poppy Smoria taking over? Thank God
pewdiepie: <b>wearing headphones</b><br>Media: he’s making fun of deaf people who cant use them.
omg I cant believe pewdiepie quit youtube :(
I’ll miss you pewds, you are my favorite daily volgger.
Who’s the new girl ?
Bro is that beanie part of his merch???? I need it.

Did he just call simplynailogical a kids chanel?
I&#39;m not sure if these pewd games are just all jokes or secretly passion projects
I haven&#39;t seen a lot of the last few videos but even I knew it wasnt a permanent hiatus 🙄 news media are blatantly selling lies and that&#39;s just a social norm. WTF is up with society man. But also yay! Get that rest Peds!
Good that you end YouTube
SimplyNailLogical is not a kids chanel!!!

He just said apo-stroffs... Lol
Srsly tho, fuck tana
Pewdiepie: breathes<br>Media: Pewdiepie withholds oxygen from people who need it more

If you have been watching pewdiepie for a long time u will know that the humar he goes to is the ones about woman
He’s so mad he didn’t get an invitation
If he saw how much trobble tana went through to get in those clothes he would be making fun of it
The way pewdiepie just cuts out the part we’re so many people shout tana name
You need a longer break
When everyone says shout out for my fans, but never shout out to my ac
He can&#39;t quit because he can&#39;t earn from anywhere except selling merch or acting

I got scared not a little
Bruh creator of the year is an Aderal.
Is it just me or do I want him to have a 9 month break...
Wait what you telling me the news is fake?!!??  Shhhhitt I would listen to my 5 yr old tell me that the sky is falling before I believe what I hear or see coming from a news source.  That&#39;s the problem we care too much about what is said about us online.  Enjoy your life and forget about whatever these fake news sources are saying and when you do decide to come back to your puppet master I mean fans we will be here waiting.
Apostrophe <br><br>Pewdiepie: appastraph

Why is poppy gloria talking as if she&#39;s pewdiepie
Did anyone else find it really funny when he called simply nailogical a kids channel lmao
Hey Pewdiepie, sorry you had to cover something so sad hopefully Felix comes back

Pewdiepie: &quot;Filming that last video was a little difficult and time consuming.&quot;<br><br>Media: <b>Pewdiepie admits that he hates doing YouTube</b>
I was so conflicted Upon reading the title, and seeing the video. I didnt want to watch it at first cause I thought for a moment this was a legitimate &quot;I quit&quot; video and i was very heart broken, then I watched it and and was VERY RELIEVED.<br>I won&#39;t lie there have been videos that you have done that I have HATED either something you said or did but I being a life long bro(female)in the bro army, still watched and liked the videos because there was some things I may have liked or you put such effort into your videos and channel that i give your videos the likes they deserve. F*ck them lieing peices of sh*t. Lmao

When people didn&#39;t finish pews videos: Pews is quitting YouTube<br>Pew Viewer since 2008: nah he already told that years ago, many many many times and yet here we are.
Heey pewdiepie..... i hope your just gonna take al looooooong break.... i&#39;ll really miss you! (I want to see you send your kids to the ranch)
He took our jorrb!!!

people who disliked actually believe otherwise ..
Lmao Felix just said that simply nailogical is a kids Chanel  😂
you literally deserve a break more than anyone else so take as long as you need off whether a month or more. we’re not heartbroken because we understand that it is normal
Sorry Pewds but Simply Nailogical is not a kids channel.
Mfw apostroff
Alright guys let’s be real these comments are pretty unoriginal.
The legend won&#39;t quit that easily. He risk his career and then quit? That is not so real. Another BIG FAT FAKE media news
Very nice idol powerrrrr powerrrrr
How often will you use the same face on the thumbnail<br><br>Pewds: Yes
Did you... Did you call Simplynailogical a kids channel??
Are you moving to mixer too? M$ sellouts.
So nobody&#39;s ganna talk about the fact that he called<br>Simply nailogical a kids channel lmao
Even my dad heard about it now that’s sad
This video was actually very nice and instructive. Good job Felix, you can go on YouTube professional.
Hello humans who read this.<br>I am asking for a big favour, as I am trying to get in contact with Pewdiepie (Felix) because I have a business idéa I think he would be interested in.<br><br>I am Swedish aswell as Felix and want to discuss a business idéa with him, but it is very hard to get in contact with him or his &quot;manager&quot; or whatever I need to in order to have a chance of him reading what I have to say.<br><br>Christmas is here in 2 hours and all I really wish is to forward a Email to him explaining my idéa<br><br><br><br>This is as random as it gets but I am desperately trying to get in contact with him so I am now trying every way possible.<br><br>Just 5 minutes with him or his manager would mean the world to me, I know many people probably try to do this but my idéa is very big and can affect the internet in a good way since a new youtube era is here.<br><br>I really dont know what else to write other than this is my biggest dream and it would be an honor to atleast get an Email that he could read.<br><br><br><br>Best regards, Alex from South of Sweden.
How dare you be against open borders and children&#39;s genitals being mutilated (for everywhere except Israel). You anti-semite!!! Next you&#39;ll go full National Socialist and be against child rape.
Dang Rest In Peace I will miss you :.(
But the king has cancelled  for quitting<br> news today
i would like to point out that simply nailogical is anything but a kids channel lmaoo
the karens don&#39;t catch the drip
It&#39;s fun and frustrating to see how Media changes your perception of reality
Enjoy your break Pewds!
Pewdiepie saying simplynaillogical is a kids channel 🤣🤣🤣
Did he just call Simply a kids channel? Lol 😂
PewDiePie Dont Quit Youtube, Please We Need You. Just, If You Tired. Rest For Some Month Or Half Year, Just Dont Quit Okay. We Need Our Minecraft Heroes (Heroes Never Die).

We love you pewds
Happy holidays pew!!!
I worked myself into a burn-out. Dident give myself enough off time and took my work home with me....<br><br>Take a break if you want dude. Its good for you. Keeps you sane.
This is like the SSundee took a break but worse, cause Pewdiepie didn&#39;t actually take a break yet.<br>Just saying, I didn&#39;t recognise any of those nominee&#39;s for creator of the year. Other than Chamberlin which I feel I&#39;ve heard somewhere before, I don&#39;t know these people. (other than mr. beast and ninja)
F
I think most people understand why Felix would want to take time out with his  lovely wife Marzia. <br>Wishing you both a very Merry Christmas, adventures and happiness in 2020. XXX
Pewdiepie: talks about how media is displaying false information <br><br><br>Pewdiepie’s fans: makes fun of the media with this meme format
Why are they like that though? Why don&#39;t you report something that is more important then &quot;Pewdipie quiting&quot;. For example, the Hong Kong protests.
Pewdiepie: <b>looks outside</b><br>Media: <b>PEWDIEPIE HAS DESTROYED THE EARTH WITH HIS RACIST EYES!</b>
Go on felix <br>Have a break<br><br><br>Have a kit kat
How the f*ck is &quot;Mongeau&quot; pronounced &quot;Mojo&quot;??
I love how down to earth you are ... - About Tana , she’s just awful,  man how many young girls I see copying her,  almost worshipping her.  This world is insane . 🙂🙃

Did he just say Simply Nailogical was a kids channel? 💀
i want to see the headlines when the break is over, i can see it now... &quot;quitter Pewdiepie decides to come back to youtube&quot; lmao cmon media
Even in Malaysia you are viral about Quit Youtube 🤣
LOL this was on Taiwanese news 😂 man.. pewdiepie is celebrity status
Pewdiepie: sees<br><br>Media: he’s making fun of blind people
Shows you everything you need to know about CNN. <br>  Like legit everything. Don&#39;t watch it.

He’s taking a break to make a baby
did he just say SIMPLY NAILOGICAL IS A KIDS CHANNEL ...omg how wrong could he be
“Let me make it clear I want a break to know how it feels”<br>CNN: “pewdiepie says he needs to feel what it’s like to break up with YouTube”
Brah. I was heartbroken. I&#39;m heartbroken every time the video ends. Keep being golden man. Keep being golden.
Felix:<br>You won YouTube. Do whatever you whant to do.
I got excited when he said Marzia watches Safiya and I died when he called Simply Nailogical a kids channel
<b>LMAO</b>
Imagine he said sike at the end
I just saw this on BitLife it’s so sad 😥 I’m gonna miss him
Pewdiepie no don’t quit YouTube or t series will take over the world

Pewdiepie: quits social media in total<br><br>Media: erases him from The yt bible
You did not, you don&#39;t have enough money yet.
Pewds I respect you alot, but I don&#39;t think you should talk about tana&#39;s past and make her look bad. We your audience have looked past your &quot;bad&quot; decisions and like you despite them. I believe you are more mature than them.
90% of those creator of the years things where make up channels like why
Simplynailogical is not a kidschannel!!! <br> <br>They just happened to take a clip from the ONE video where she hangs out with a kid

YouTube doesn&#39;t have the guts to remove PewDiePie because they know he&#39;s our king, and if he falls we all bail. Instead, YouTube has been slowly taking out less important targets.

Go get you some self actualization felix &lt;3
Who is smarter <br><br>Major news site with millions of dollars and hundreds of employees <br><br>Or<br><br><br> 9-year old that understood the end of a video
Pewdiepie: lives an amazing life and is very happy<br><br><br>Media: pewdiepie is making fun of depressed people
Creator of the year.<br>I wouldn&#39;t want it either. That was total corporate cringe!
My classmate that hate Pewdiepie: YES!!! Your Piewdiepie quits YT<br><br>ME AND THE REST OF MY GANG THAT SUPPORTS PIEWDIEPIE: hahaha * claps for their stupidity*
I want that ditto face looking hat
Explanation pewdiepie wants to take a break because he wants to make bebes
I like how they always mention his &quot;racism&quot;, even if it&#39;s ab article about Pewds taking a sh*t they will find a way to remind us of what he said back in 1985 because he&#39;s still cOntROverSiaL. Yellow press at its finest
The state of fake news... all mainstream outlets.<br>And yet they ban YOUTUBERS..  INDEPENDANT media...
Simple exemple of media manipulation. It applies in everything, specialy in the palestine conflit
I looooove PEW NEWS
my dad read the title and told me that pewdiepie was gonna quit youtube and I was like what!?! That&#39;s impossible! now im mad at him
I&#39;m glad pewds can laugh at this, I&#39;d get so annoyed if people kept misunderstanding what I was saying
most genuine youtuber. smart and funny too

This is so sad :(((((
did anyone else think his shirt says Hershey? or is it just me?...………….ok just me :&#39;-D
PewDiePie: Supports people taking breaks from work<br>Liberal Media: PewDiePie thinks millionaires have it hard<br>Conservative Media: PewDiePie is a commie
This was really good content. Probably because I agreed with everything pewds said...but it could also be that this is legit good content.
Wish u and mazia so much luck in the future ! Ur development in the past months or maybe years is amazing and I&#39;m so fricking existed about ur &quot;coming back&quot;. Again, wish u the best. <br>Ps kinda jealous, but that&#39;s not typical me.

Media: PewD-<br><br>Me: shutthefuckup-inator
PewDiePie: <b>dies</b><br><br>Media: PewDiePie is harassing living people
PewDiePie: <b>does nothing</b><br><br>Media: PewDiePie is bullying people that move.
Media: <b>exist</b><br><br>PewDiePie’s fans: i’m about to mock this whole man’s career
PewDiePie: <b>actually quits YouTube</b><br><br>Media: We need to stop PewDiePie for bullying people who use YouTube.
What clickbait!
Hey guys! Did you notice that poppy smoria said “I never said I’m quiting”  he said “I” ive had my suspicions for awhile but now they’re confirmed. Now just hear me out. Maybe just maybe. . . Poppy is PewDiePie!
This is how media treats the migration issue in Europe too.
Funny how mainstream media desperately tries to act like it&#39;s in tune with internet culture. <br><br>Ok boomers. Maybe do some journalism now.

The amount of attention they give you must be flattering. You’re like a well known lightening rod they can use for propaganda.<br><br>Instead o being annoyed that someone is so successful, why not be inspired and try to learn how they do what they do. That’s seems more fruitful. They’re not like magic and contain something that can’t be replicated. I mean various things might have made it easier for them, which you could say about anything, but it might also be easier for you so who knows, either way you’d at least get better by studying them.

I just wanted you to know that you’re the best and you always will be.  It’s your personality bro.  You have a great heart.  I’ll miss you on your break.  You deserve to enjoy yourself though.  It’s not easy doing what you do, I don’t care what anyone thinks.
Reason why elon criticized news media
It&#39;s because it&#39;s a baby!!!
Pewdiepie you will get arrested by FBI your saying Sweden will invade with weapons how are these jokes you seem like a psychotic lunatic don&#39;t be surprised standing in the U.S supreme court for multiple allegations you might end up in jail and become someone&#39;s wife

I died when he said Simply nailogical is a kids channel out of all the videos to chose from lol
No screw Tana, she is a useless human being.
It&#39;s better than all
Pewdiepie uploads a video 25 hours after the other 24th hour pewdiepie dies
Pewdiepie:I am not quitting Youtube <br>Media: He is lying and abandoning his fans.<br>Pewdiepie:*sighs*Why does it happen to me?
six million people have seen this now.
Don&#39;t quit pewds.  p.s.  Your eyes are dreammy blue green in this video. xoxo
PewDiePie: I am taking a break<br><br>Media: he chooses spiritual path
&quot;That&#39;s who is the creator of the year?&quot; That hit deeper than it should&#39;ve been. Like wow. Yes, that&#39;s exactly who&#39;s creator of the year. The gap is unbelievable
APPASTRAWPH
NEWSFLASH: Pewdiepie Quits Snapchat
in every countries , there are trash reporters in media. In Korea we call them &quot;ki re gi&quot; = &quot;기레기&quot;
breaks are good for mental health
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=260">4:20</a> there’s your answer for why they’re  blowing it out of proportion. It’s for the brain dead people who actually read their garbage unironically
I thought it was believable, but I’m not at all surprised it was fake as shit.
I didn’t realize you’d gone practically nonstop this whole time.  I really hope you don’t stress out from NOT constantly working and checking everything.  I hope your vacation goes great though.  You really do deserve to blow us off for a while and think about yourself, Marzia, and your critters 💕
What if he’s not even taking a break
pewdiepie quits YouTube<br>when?
Stupid media, should have been Mr. Awesome Beast!
if he stops making videos,maybe he&#39;ll lose all his subscribers
YOU DESERVE THIS BREAK
Apostrophe
Lol if it was fan voted, can we just take a moment to realize that Mr.Beast chose to save the earth than tell his fans to vote him creator of the year. We all know he would have won if he told his fans to vote for him.
u not a vlogger?
Poppy Smoria: Acts as if he’s PewDiePie himself<br><br>Media: PeWdiEpiE’s tWiN bRotHeR reVeAlEd?
These comments are amazing
Pewdiepie: Epstein didn&#39;t kill himself Media: Pewdiepie is an anti-semite

Sweden

We were on a break 😂😂😂
When he takes a break he should just pre record like a 20 hr play through of some game and upload like 45 min once a week for his die hard fans, right?
<b>Ninja? Ok...</b> 😂
I can understand that you need a break and be heartbroken at the same time thank you very much
What would we do without News Media?
In reality, he’s on hiatus
peuu neuus
Omg I am so sad
Appastrof
People forget pewds took a break last year in August, it wasn&#39;t too long but it was significant cause he prepared no videos. He&#39;s allowed to have breaks
Felix:i got robbed af <br><br>Media:&quot;he&#39;s making fun of helpless people&quot;
Pewds: i never said i was quitting!<br><br><br>Media: pewds lied about quitting youtube!

I love the way he says &#39;apostrophe&#39;
Felix: I can&#39;t sell myself<br>Media: Felix selled himself....... TO RACIST NAZIS!!112w!
Haha 😂 this was in the belgian news
Take a break homie, you need it

Pewds:*<b>sees cristene (simplynailogical)*</b><br>A kids channel.<br>*Me knowing her channel*: n o

kinda want to work for news media just to get paid to watch through your videos
Imagine taking a vacation? Pfft.
Felix, <br>know that you have so many people behind you who support you in whatever that you do. Take a break. Relax, reset, and recharge. Take some time to be with your family this holiday season and be with Marzia and the puppers! you&#39;ve given us so much man, have a good break &lt;3 <br>love ya dude,<br>PewdFam

Pewdiepie: takes a break<br><br>Media: <b>PEWDIEPIE OFFICIALLY QUITS YOUTUBE THIS IS SO SAD</b><br><br>Seriously wtf is wrong is with this world.
Mr. Beast deserves all the awards.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=330">5:30</a> Pewds watches his own videos? 🤔
We should make our own awards! To finally give credit to actual good youtubers!!
PewDiePie gets himself a black sweatshirt<br>Media: PewDiePie hates his own race!
Pewds shouldn’t have to explain why he wants to take a break😤😤😤
You and Marzia deserve a break ❤️
Noooooooo Felix
and I thought pewdiepie had more than t series
The most subtle flex with the fold phone
jesus christ poor gus had to sit at that award thing yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
Casey should stop putting himself in shitty situations
That’s because The Media doesn’t do their JOB by doing Research  😩 it’s their JOB
They don&#39;t do the work anymore they just guess now
&quot;I cant let someone step in&quot;<br>say that to raywilliamjohnson
Everyone: Apostrophe<br><br>PewDiePie: ApPaStRoFf
Not even fitz talk much about drugs....
Glad he brought back his channel
Pew die pie said he was going to delete his channel at 100 mill hasn’t done it
The nword
I love the way he says “apostrophe”
Got married <br>Beat ender dragon<br>100,000,000<br><br>Hmm... I spy with my little eye...
I got panic disorder because I didn&#39;t take any breaks myself, breaks are healthy, go take a break, everyone, just die for a little while and reincarnate when you feel great again.
Pewdiepie: shakes a mans hand.<br><br>The Media: <b>Pewdiepies gay?!?</b>
Tana &quot;Mojo&quot;
Why don&#39;t you just let Edgar take over the channel?

Tar du en pause?

Who remembers years ago when there was that hoax about him dying of food poisoning
take your time bud
Pewds: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFSqtrivFs&amp;t=308">5:08</a><br>Me: OMG THATS SO SAD 😎😎
I can&#39;t believe pewds said that simply nailogical is a kids channel I&#39;m dying
Everyone just keep racking up view time on pewds account so he can pay rent haha
pewdiepie doesn&#39;t get enough views for his amount of subs
“Apastroff”
pewdiepie  is  hype....😂
He deserves a break they need to chill
Appestroff
Tonight i had a dream, pewdiepie was my dad. That was a good dream because i dont have a dad.
I got suspended ones for saying CNN is fake news, I was correct.
lol they acting like we sad but we’ve been asking you to take a break for years...
What do pewdiepie &amp; trump have n common?
I like tana mongol
I know he was not quitting just a break a small hiatus , he never mentioned quit! It&#39;s so annoying like boi! But I&#39;ll wait for him to come back! I support you in whatever you are going to do for the better for yourself! PEACE!
PewDiePie “actually quits youtube”<br>Media “dies”
NOOOOO
Why😭😭😭😭
&quot;I&#39;m Poppy Smoria&quot;
Thank you for being a person with a consistent character and morals &lt;3
11m: she&#39;s so humble: that&#39;s why her clothes have her initials written all over them
I am from Taiwan, and I feel annoyed that the mainstream media here use Pewdiepie&#39;s name to write articles just to gain more views.<br><br>I don&#39;t watch Pewds&#39; youtube every day (I really love to, tho lol), but the moment I saw those articles pop up I immediately knew it can&#39;t be true that pews is quiting youtube. Very funny that the articles about pews quiting youtube almost have the same content: a.) pewdiepie is king of youtube and b.) shocking news that he will leave youth because c.) he said &quot;I want to take a break&quot;
We&#39;re talking about Media Pewdiepie, What did you wait for?
A-pos-troph?
My local radio station talked about it
PewDiePie: <b>Is tired</b><br><br>Media: &quot;GUYS HE&#39;S TIRED HE&#39;S GONNA QUIT&quot;<br><br><br>PewDiePie: <b>actually generating secondary content through subtly indicating highly misleading statement leads that entices poorly immersed journalists from mainstream media outlets to his advantage</b><br><br>Media: <b>*surprised Pikachu face*</b>
decade*
Omg I really thought for real he quit omg

This format: I&#39;m basically top text bottom text<br>People: I like this and I&#39;ll comment like this because it gets so many likes

I think i can speak for all of us 19 year olds when I say that we totally respect your choice. In fact we want you to have the best break you can possibly imagine! :)
Pewdiepie: a gamer/youtuber creator<br><br>The media: this is a certified vlogger classic
So dose this mean if pewds takes a break from youtube t-series is gonna take the throne ???
It&#39;s true or not
“pewdiepie calls out tana, recently awarded ‘creator of the year,’ for promoting drugs to her underage audience” would’ve been a much better article tbh<br>still annoying, but if they wanted him in a title...
Pewdiepie: I&#39;m just gonna take a small break next year cuz I&#39;m just a bit tired.<br>Media: <b>AAAHHHH BREAKINGG NEWWWSS PEWDIEPIE FELIX HAS QUIT YOUTUBE FOREVERRR BECAUSE OF RACIST COMMENTTSS</b>

❤️
PewDiePie: kisses Marzia<br><br>Media: He&#39;s trying to eat her!
You go Pewd’s, take a break, relax for a while, enjoy some time without worry, we will miss the content for a bit, but everyone needs a break.
Here in the Netherlands every youtuber in the news is called a vlogger
Pewdiepie says he&#39;s taking a break, doesn&#39;t realize YouTube doesn&#39;t allow vacations.
Pewdiepie is quitting YouTube? About time.
Pewdiepie was like a father to me
He really called simply a kids channel😂😂😂😂
Quit youtube is not something that you do. Its not a day to day job. You just stop.
Someone should tell PewDiePie about this.
Just take a vacation a few dedicated weeks of the year it really helps
Pewdiepie: Has no cool awards<br>Also Pewdiepie: Awards are dumb guys
Media: YouTube royalty Pewdiepie has been outmatched by an eight-year-old boy after his dramatic announcement that he&#39;d be taking a break from the video site.
Liberal media is a joke<br>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised because of all the slander and reticuling he gets from it that he probably leans more to the right, not like that&#39;s a bad thing of course
OMG THIS IS SO SAD
19 yr olds let pewds take a break and let&#39;s wait until he comes back
Please don&#39;t quit Youtube, the media was lying don&#39;t listen to them. I still need you Pewdiepie and the whole Bro Army also still needs you too. So don&#39;t leave us Pewds. We still love you bro. Be strong. And brofist too.

I SAW THAT NEWS ARTICLE AND CRIED-
I saw the title of “Pewdiepie quitting youtube for a year in 2020, in china’s website.” Figured out it is probably a click bait video, and come to find this video and just oike I thought.... Lmao All you said you are gonna take a break lmao.
