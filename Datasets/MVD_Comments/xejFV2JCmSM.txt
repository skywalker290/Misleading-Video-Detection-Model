It was a f building but it was the most beautiful one
You will be missed.<br>Ikea spaceship
I didn’t know that he could sing that well
Bro is looking at his Swedish land while playing one of the most American songs 💀
honestly, i always prefered the old ikea tower.. it&#39;s just prettier
This must be how the Ancients felt when they sent off the Destiny...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejFV2JCmSM&amp;t=702">11:42</a> why did I actually get emotional
We will all miss ikea tower
This has been an epic journey, goodbye you beautiful structure.<br><br>o7
We are back in it. Beetroot has been destroyed, everyone is still alive. This is great

i love how he keeps a missing texture block in his house
Whatching in 2023 and this series still are great
Pewdiepie singing Richard Marx is the funniest thing ever
Miss u
This Minecraft series is better than other Netflix series
So we are gonna ignore the fact that all his pets died in the end of the last episode
Jesus loves you

it definitely does not feel like its been 3 years
Bruh towards the end why you playing America the Beautiful?! 😂😂

Back for my annual rewatch of the series, its crazy to think its been almost 3 years
That was actually incredibly impressive. And strangely emotional.<br>Goodbye OG Ikea Tower!
he definetly use creator mode to build the rocket ikea tower<br><br>where did he get the honey
Pewds: sends ikea tower to space <br><br>Me: <b>how the hell did u do that</b>
But isaac #10 or whatever his name was is still there
😲
it&#39;s nice to see pewds use his horse even after getting an elytra, he loves him so much.
Calm down everybody!! I think he just Liked made a copy of the world!!
I opened minecraft world after a week and Now I have A Chest full of eggs
IKEA tower was like father to me
I&#39;m gonna cry
Holy! Frick lore.
Are you using Banjo and Kazooie voices for feigi and his girlfriend?
What an impressive bye bye to Ikea Tower. He will live forever in space, the final frontier and explore strange new worlds. He will boldly go where no Ikea Tower has gone before.
I rewatched this vid and it makes me sad for a reason
I never thought I&#39;d cry over a tower
Yea not gonna lie but the tower you made earlier looked wayyy better
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejFV2JCmSM&amp;t=663">11:03</a> why do I feel bad about a pile of blocks
goodbye... Ikea Tower 😢 I can&#39;t belive he did it 🤯. IKEA FOREVER
Good by IKEA tower
Who else low key really loved when he sang 😂
he use chets he has no hony and now he has cap
The banjo Kazooie sounds. Fire.
This fully grown man singing that song as his IKEA tower launched into space killed me off 💀 He deserves his 111,000,000 subscribers
can&#39;t believe he launched Ikea tower into space lol
this is the romance of a man
Neil Armstrong: We are just entering space<br>Wait is that IKEA Tower&quot;
rip ikea tower
Feelix you have villager and villager trades cake 😃
Why is there a block with a missing texture Felix?
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ANIMALS THEY BLOW UP!!
We gonna ignore the fact that jeorgen could’ve used the normal stairs?
goddamn.. pewds knows how to make you sad even by sending a building to the space
Why the fuck and I emotional over a tower
Old ikea tower is probably not so far cause of building height
Where ever you go, what ever you doo ♫
I cried about a tower being sent off to space…
HAHAHAHA felix singing is just so iconic HAHAHAHAHAHA
What happened in last episode!
I love How he could have just ridden joergen up the normal stairs but he chooses to spend hours making a cake ladder lol
Im not crying… you are!
PewDiePie: “you want to be lord lord of the chicken?” <br>Feigi: waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!
Does PewDiePie ever leave a description?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 bye bye
I like how you just forgotten the last episode
A sad tower never forget that
Fergie
How does he make it so sad every time a fictional character leaves and why am I actually attached?
How in the Criss Cross Apple Sauce beetroot eating water sheep did this guy actually manage to sent an entire skyscraper into space?! I thought he was joking about it like when &quot;Jeorgen&quot; pushed the lever until I saw it actually happening. He&#39;s obliviously hacking but I can&#39;t believe he actually did this in Minecraft!
I love how all of us are sad because a MINECRAFT BUILDING is being sent to space
The old IKEA Tower looks different at the End
Who else heard &quot;cake bladder cake bladder cake bladder&quot;
The chicken monarch? Lol
Jesus Christ I can barely make a redstone clock after playing Minecraft for a year and this man who just returned to Minecraft is sending building to space. Lesson learned: I suck at redstone
Ikea tower
Houston we have a problem, it seems like there is an IKEA tower in our way
RIP IKEA tower ;(
Such an anime moment <br>I teared up when ikea tower was gone<br>:(
This man has lost his brain from minecraft
o7 ikea tower
i clicked this video so i can see the god
Last episode: <b>BEETROOT BLOWS UP IKEA TOWERRRR</b><br>Next episode: cake ladder! :&gt;
how to push ikea tower like that
Ngl I kinda teared up watching this
Not sure if anyone else has notice or appreciates it but I love how you are using the Banjo-Kazooie/Banjo-Tooie character voice sounds as your Minecraft character voices. It’s hilarious and nostalgic.
our <b>GOD</b> is real in <b>real life</b> :)
Rewatching this 2 years later, and I’m just like “what the frick are the nosises that the animals and creepers make🤣🤣”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejFV2JCmSM&amp;t=731">12:11</a> I think he cutted the video because he is crying
The title 😐
Don’t get rid of ikea tower (old)
I Promised Myself I Wouldn&#39;t Cry.
Ikea tower being send to space, that&#39;s the saddest thing ever 🥲
You trolled me in before episode, now I hate you 😂😂😂
Ikea rocket
HOW TF DID THE CAKE LADDER ACTUALLY WORK I&#39;M SHOOK
Everyone: Talking about Ikea Tower going to space<br><br>Me wondering how Felix got Honey Blocks:
In an altern universe:<br>Watersheep: * doesnt exist*<br>Pewds: We finally beat the enderdragon!! - minecraft pt. 4
Goodbye Ikea Tower
What a way to end an episode
I cant believe I&#39;m crying over a minecraft build getting sent off to space
What happened to him blowing up Sven and the others?
As soon he said “the new IKEA tower is glorious” an ad then came on and immediately said “that’s ridiculous”. 😭
Felix: Sven, why does IKEA Tower have to go?<br>Sven: *Eternal scream*.
Wait... how is sven in this video? didn&#39;t he die in the last episode?
?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejFV2JCmSM&amp;t=637">10:37</a>
I thought sven dies
Wait a minute… where all the honey blocks that Felix use to send ikea tower to space
GOOOD
wwwwwywwwwwwwywwwwy
How’d u get honeycomb block
Im sheding tears
Im crying right now
YEEeEeeEeEeEes SVEN Is BacK!!!
Felix, I am so sorry. In the last fireworks video I said you were copying Uberhaxornova by making fireworks just like him, except inferior. I was wrong, and this episode proves it. James could never build as cool of a firework as this, and he never did. The ball is clearly in his side of the hockey rink. Any move he makes now is just him trying to top you or copy you. Sorry again, and hopefully you are having a good day. Many blessings to you and your family from all of us. 👼🧚‍♀️🧚‍♂️🤶🎅
the first scene is actually at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejFV2JCmSM&amp;t=506">8:26</a>

Its so sad that ikea tower is leaving😔😭
good bye ikea tower
Well, looks like ikea tower will be in a safe place, a better place, with feigi, jeorgen, jeorgen the second, water sheep, bernie, and pee pee poo poo, they will all be watching pewds from up there, they will always be remembered....

Damn Felix u r really a gud singer...  Not joking
me: wait, coudnt joergen have gone up the stairs and felix just dig a pathway in the hill?<br><br>felix: nah fam
I thought that Sven Jorgen died in the last episode
Did anyone notice at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xejFV2JCmSM&amp;t=108">1:48</a> that there is a error block. Would that be because of the texture pack or?
I like how he made feigi have kazooies voice
feigi
Let&#39;s all take a moment for Ikea Tower even if it&#39;s been a while...<br><br>IKEA Tower represents the goodness of the past, and the New IKEA Tower represents the greatness of the future...
How have you done to make Ikea Tower fly ? This is amazing (and sad) !
this is boring
This must have costume a lot of iron
Can we all just take a momment to realize how good Felix is at singing?

I love how every comment starts with I love how.
FEEEELLLLIIIIIIXXX!
Horses don&#39;t take fall damage tho
Ik im taking this way to far but whetever<br><br>Theory that pewds got so badly hurt in the explosion, all his pets died so he made up this episode (and the rest) in his head to cope
Does anyone notice nathinal anchel music
lmao in one of my and my friend&#39;s games on his ps3, I made a ton of cakes and put them all over the house, especially in the middle of halls and doorways, in every corner, on top of any crfting table or wall nook, and floating in place. Some of them obviously would be blocking his path so he had to eat his way through them. Then he&#39;d come up behind me while I&#39;m making more and be like &quot;you better not be making more cakes!&quot;
Omg
I cried over a tower :) great 😭😂
I watch a full brown man talk to his imagunary sog and a freekin tower for 13 Minutes and its worth it
Was it just me or did you lowkey cry

Bye bye IKEA tower

At this point he&#39;s just professional shitposting
At least feigi isn&#39;t a virgin anymore 😂
... ok
The death of the council of beatroot was a death we were waiting for<br>And It<br>Felt <br>Good
Cool and defiantly not fake fact is that cakes are made out of redstone not cherries and the icing is quarts and the actual cake is dirt

There is a hight limit so ikea tower is probably still in there constantly hitting the ceiling in agony.
This episode was in top 10 saddest anime deaths😭😭<br>I really was going to cry😔😭
So saaaaaaaadddddd
I wonder if he could make a building with pistons under it making it bounce up continously...then you&#39;ll have a bouncing building...maybe like out of wool<br>...or even better put slime in it and make a friggin insane bouncy house thing 😂
Banjo kazooie voices 🤣

It is weird that all of his pets died in the previous episode and now they are alive... I think Felix just backup the world before his pets died.
