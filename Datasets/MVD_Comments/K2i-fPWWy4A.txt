I know this is late but, I believe; “F to pay respects” should be the meme of the decade. It’s the goto message for ANY sad moment on the internet.

I was riding through town on my mtb one night, street lights were out and clipped a railing at the bottom on a hill, come off and landed on my face on the bitumen and scorpioned, skinned half my face, broke my nose and crushed part of my skull... called the ambulance, they rocked up in 10 minutes, got one round of surgery that night, had another surgery 3 weeks later... guess how much that cost me, America? ....$0

I thought Felix just uploaded a video but nope, surprisingly Youtube Recommendation gave this.
Meme of the decade should go to either Loss or F to pay respect I think
lol why would Meme Review be flagged for false information? it&#39;s MEMES. It&#39;s not even Pew News!<br><br>After re-watching this...what exactly is the false information? Nothing was stated as actual fact. Are the fact checkers just not able to sense sarcasm or satire? Or was it the image of the morons Felix called out for being anti-vaxination morons? Their shirts definitely had false information.
Doge 🐶
But now he is floor gang
YouTube: recommending this after trump had one of his tweets fact-checked<br>Me: “nice, I see what you did there”

Top 5 memes of the decade<br><br><br>1. Trollface<br>2. Spongebob<br>3. Pepe<br>4. F<br>5. Doge (I mean, it was pretty influential to be fair)
ugandan knuckles should be the meme of the decade.
if keanu reeves had a biopic who would play him?
“Illegal in at least 54 states”
Gordon Ramsay memes were pretty strong for the entire decade, though I guess it has died down in the last couple years. I think it should be a meme that was used consistently over the past 10 years. Just like the previous decade&#39;s meme would definitely be lolcats.

MEME OF DECADE IS OBVOIOUSLY THANOS
Two years ago in eighth grade My friend and I started clapping and saying “meme 👏🏻 review 👏🏻” at lunch break over and over and then the popular kids started yelling at us “bum bum bum bum bum ur hairline” bc we both have widows peaks and we ignored them and still said “meme 👏🏻review 👏🏻” and then they started getting mad and reported as the principal and the principal called us to her office and we got detention for two weeks for harassing other students so we started doing it everyday after that until we got suspended moral of the story is if you wanna annoy popular kids yell meme  review

U seriously think scums who trashes public facilities/robs stores/attacks police and steals their weapons(and funnily enough not been shot to death like it would&#39;ve been in US)/setting people with opposite views on fire(if u haven&#39;t seen these it it&#39;s cuz western media is as biased)/geneally affects all residents peaceful lives and makes society fall apart should be person of the year? They are some of the more radical ones,  but other protesters agreed to their behaviours and let this happen, they even donate to them, they are as guilty.
Okay meme of the decade should be area 51 WE GOT THE GOVERNMENT INVOLVED AND WE ACTUALLY DID IT ON  T O P  OF THE FACT WE KEPT IT ALIVE FOREVER

Spongebob&#39;s been here for a hot minute, just sayin&#39; 🤧

Personally, i&#39;d choose the whole of gta san andreas as the best meme of the decade.

SpongeBob
Baby yoda was best year of last decade let’s make it the best meme of this Decade too
The drake meme should be atleast top 5
Either F or pepe the frog or bee movie

3 candidates for the Meme of the Decade should be: F, SpongeBob and Doge or Pepe
Meme of the decade - me, because I will live for years to come
Spongebob is meme of the decade, like common its common sense to have spongebob as meme of the decade!
Pepe, doge, or spongebob!
ROBBIE ROTTEN
“Why are there two of them”
Meme of Decade should be Bruh. It has  been there and will continue to be there in tinge future.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2i-fPWWy4A&amp;t=908">15:08</a> spongebob has such a variety of memes and expressions and format literally any screenshot from a spongebob episode could become a meme so i say spongebob is meme of the decade
Dood Pepe is eternal...
Meme of the decade should be SpongeBob. This is because all of his memes have been relevant throughout the decade and are highly likely to live on because of their relatable-ness in daily life.
&quot;F&quot; for respect,LOSS and Ugandan Knuckles should be the top contestants
Spongebob is the meme of the decade!
Baby Yoda sucks.
This man is cute tho
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2i-fPWWy4A&amp;t=127">2:07</a> pewds its two of the stood up, like towers, with a plane in the background, PEWDS!
Pepe should be meme of the decade.
Bruh
The Drake Meme should be meme of the decade, cuz it won&#39;t <b>D I E</b>
Definitely has to be SpongeBob, dem memes continue to be funny and there&#39;s always new ones
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2i-fPWWy4A&amp;t=127">2:07</a> &quot;I don&#39;t understand this one, why is there two of them&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Pewds....the twin towers..
Pepe meme of the decade

We all know that Rage Comics and Doge are the best memes of the decade. MAYBE Spongebob
Spongebob or the confused white dude should be the meme of the decade
F

pepe for me
The &#39;white guy blinking&#39; meme is definitely not the meme of the decade, CAUSE ITS THE MEME OF THE CENTURY！ THE IMMORTAL MEME :)
Probably the Rick Roll or Spongebob.
All your memes are belong to us
Doge
No review of......WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87!!!
I believe this is the first time I’ve seen a meme before Pewds has reviewed it
Pepe just makes the most sense to me honestly
this intro is such shit
Guys for memes of the decade, and we have to vote cat on table meme it’s quality
Meme of the decade is easily <b>Pepe</b> I had to edit this because he literally says it at the end of the video 🤦🏻‍♂️
PewDiePie said this is me when I wasn&#39;t born a trebuchet, but poppy smoria said the same thing.... Do they have the same MIND?
The two xbox&#39;s are supposed to be twin towers lmao
Who clicked on this thinking it was legit

That intro was a lot for my eyes. The bite of 87 meme got rated 87 but baby Yoda isn&#39;t meme of the decade material, he&#39;s cute that&#39;s it. Press f for respect is it for me. Its gonna last.

When doge is meme of decade, press F to pat respects
F to pay respects should be meme of decade! I will always say it for the rest of my life! It has always been an amazing meme that’s still relevant
Meme of the decade has to be spongebob, kermit the frog or the star wars prequels
i must say: spongebob memes are overused as hell and will never be funny. this just in; memes about the pokemon noises in the anime (see figure 1.1- Victreebel)
uganda knuckles uganda knuckles uganda knuckles
I think doge should.
Meme of decade should be filthy frank bruh
Spongebob is my meme of the decade.

Meme of the year: PINK GUY
No the -YBox
Pepe.
Y&#39;all mind if I self promote
I would have voted for Pepe 🐸 but the doggy is a good choice 👍
Yo everyone forgot about AREA 51! That was by far the longest lasting meme of the decade, and it physically got people together. Hell, people literally traveled across the country to be there. It also produced some really good memes. Meme of the decade definitely belongs to Area 51.<br><br><br>Yo Pewds or Grandayy should really make a poll so we can vote on it.
For some reason i dont get your videos in my feed anymore and i knew something was up so now i just go to my subscriptions and check manually.
Spongebob should be meme of the decade
Hi Pewdiepie, I&#39;m from Brazil and my English is not very good, so can you add subtitles to your videos?
Spongebob is meme of the decade
pewds.  I have to tell you.  I&#39;m not rich.  But, for 99% of the world&#39;s population, I&#39;m RICH.  I can buy anything I want.  I can spend $3k on a fridge.  I&#39;ve spent $10k plus on computers.  But, I can&#39;t stomach paying $150 for pj&#39;s.  Tell me I&#39;m slowly saving the world by buying these moderately cute pj&#39;s.  And, yes, I love that I can buy pj&#39;s that match my wife.  But, I can buy that for $40.  I need a reason.
MEME of decade should be Baby Yoda~!   (O&gt;O)
Bet he won’t like this
