Goblin slayer messed me up man😅😢😢
Don&#39;t underplay Higurashi. It&#39;s the best horror anime out there with a masterpiece of a  mystery plot. And it gave birth to Umineko When They Cry, the best piece of fiction ever (the VN is, not the anime).

I know this video is two years old but man, Goblin Slayer does such a good job of establishing that goblins are pieces of shit that deserve elimination in that first episode.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=178">2:58</a> This is right before Rika repeatedly stabs her own head
Where is the bridge
&quot;I would never punch something if I got mad&quot; clearly you&#39;ve never been mad enough felix.

Sooo anyone wants some yogurt?
It would be sadder if it was Kakayoin versus Dio.
Im disappointed to not see &quot;CAN WE COPYSTRIKE PEWDIEPIE?&quot; In this video
The sequence of his reactions is legendary he be like seeing walking dead s1 &quot;awww noooo&quot; then the next picture shows up and then he goes &quot;HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA&quot;
not corpse party awakening repressed memories
damn, a very long time ago he already reviewed this subreddit
What’s at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=405">6:45</a>
I understood 50% of these images 👌
Damn that horror web-comic brings me back, we used to leave that shit up in Biology Class so that next period would see it and read it.<br><br>Poor bastards never knew what hit them.
Woohoo, I learned that Felix considers me Oldskool Bro. :D
I have legit PTSD because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=630">10:30</a> :( the back of the head alone scared the shit out of me
I&#39;m too old to understand any of these and I&#39;m younger than Felix
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=358">5:58</a><br>UHHHHH
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=425">7:05</a> it is not yogurt, she just got told it was yogurt
What anime is he suggesting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=64">1:04</a>? I heear tegentub &#39;gorilla&#39;.
When he started watching the goblin slayer part it made me thankful I instead chose to try and read the manga
Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni  for those that want to know about the &#39;nail ripping out&#39; anime and haven&#39;t watched it, your welcome it is actually very very good
How is the video called with all the kids in the woods
&quot;come on if you haven&#39;t watched TALSNEBEKDIUDBWJWIEU&quot;
Wtf was that naked fairy
Girl gets killed terribly by goblin <br>Pewds:pfffffft
Talking about not getting mad at video games, The bridge shows up
Death notes one makes me sad
For Real though, I&#39;ve had a breakdown like the remote guy...Just not to the point of anal.
goblin slayer the most heart warming  respecting waman shonen ever
The more time I spend on the internet the more I realise the internet is just one big in joke.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=400">6:40</a> anyone know that one?
Still don&#39;t get the yogurt one. Probably best I don&#39;t. 😆
I will have to wait when pewds finally finds the truth about the yoghurt
Didn&#39;t get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=127">2:07</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=424">7:04</a> I see you are a man of culture as well.
YouTube best platform ever!!!
dude that face change after watching goblin slayer <br>thats exactly how i felt
i cant tell whether hes seen shoujo ramune or not
For those curious, the one where the squirrel bites the girl is from &#39;Nyan Neko Sugar Girls,&#39; and you can find the whole series on YouTube if you&#39;re interested.
Yoo. With the dissing markiplier 🤔 weird energy bro.
&quot;Old School Bros; sounds good, feels better.&quot;
I love how pewds played off the yogurt pic😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=117">1:57</a> final destination movie i think, quite unpleasant to watch. don&#39;t really remember, have to re watch it.
Y pewds uploads in just 720p
goblin slayer was tramitizing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=493">08:13</a> Goblin Slayer had some pretty insane clips..... didnt expect them to be their, but there they were......random as fuck... dope anime though
i think the you want some yogurt is from boku no piku

Leeroy Jengkings
I watched his previous videos and I realized his soul dies a bit more every year and he gets more depressed in the videos
Anyone else got this reccomended in 2021?
You know it&#39;s gonna be great when he starts laughing by just reading the twitter account&#39;s name
Felix really lost face weight. He looks skinnier now. Good for him
Image: Shows just about anything<br><br>PewDiePie: Ahhhhh, the classic
Take a shot everytime pewds says the word &quot;classic&quot;
You see yogurt is a keyword for cu-
For pewds is it just a picture of a bridge
noooooooooo<br>classic<br>nooooooo<br>classic classic<br>nooooooooooooooo<br>classic
I was waiting for the bridge😂
I can’t believe this is one year old 😳

This video got recommended to me exactly 1 year later
One year ago
the world is rotten.....I will kill all the criminals and I will become the god of the new world
I watched the goblin slayer scene, and though pretty distasteful, I&#39;ve watched a serbian film. Nothing will ever top (in s bad way) that.

Damn that one with the kiddos looking at that hedge. That one hits hard when you first watch it.
NOOOOOOOOO<br>Classic, classic<br>NOOOOOOOOO<br>Classic, classic<br>AHHHHHHHHH
poki
&quot;when they cry&quot;<br><br>nah. WHEN THE BIRDS CRY.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=425">7:05</a> yes, he just asked if you want some yogurt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o">0:00</a> tap this button rapidly to watch ahego press moan.
Yo can someone tell me the kids in the field one. What&#39;s that about and where is the video.
Wheres the one with pewdiepie and the bridge
you should try doing wynncraft, idk why this came to my mind but you should
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=192">3:12</a> I&#39;m out of the loop anyone able to explain the minecraft one to me like you would speak to your dad?
&quot;Leeroy Jankings&quot;
Li remember when PEWDS was like &quot;I hate reaction channels&quot; <br>He is one now
Jesus Loves all of you &lt;3
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=487">08:07</a> what actually is it?? ive never seen it
Felix: I don&#39;t know this one.<br>Me sees Kingdom Hearts: NOOOOOO!!!!!
The ppl aint ready for berserk
How to describe this video in two words<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Meme Nostalgia
Anyone else catch the Danganronpa one before they find Nagito?
The bunny just gets me every<br>time
When they crie<br>Pewds: When the birds crie
Whats the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=400">6:40</a>?? Idk
This whole video was uploaded a week before quarantine. <br><br>Strange coincidence...
BRUH I just realized that pewds read Horang&#39;s Nightmare. One of the most scariest shit I&#39;ve read.
They should have the “I gently opened the door.” Text bubble from Doki-Doki.
The Kingdom Heart pic shouldve just been a title screen...<br>That whole &quot;franchise&quot; the the most shameless cash grab in history.<br>Moshing two of the most popular dynasties togeatgher even though they <b>absolutly nothing</b> to do with eachother for the sole purpose of milking more money out of them by creating cross-over audiences,<br><br>Sure its a brilliant business idea cuz people are fakking idiots... but its a fakking soulless, shit project from any creative standpoint...&#39; Its morally bankrupt on the same level as EA selling the same friggin game for 60 bucks every year by just putting it in a new box with the current year on the side... and idiots keep buying them... <b>every year.</b><br>The whole concept is an unfortunate event.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=329">5:29</a> walter white and jesse one was also good
Just realized that the &quot;Do you want some yogurt&quot; picture is from Shoujo Ramune.<br><br><br>I swear, I haven&#39;t watched it.<br><b>yet</b>
When you realize where the do you want yogurt is from...
What&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=245">4:05</a>?
Finished reading berserk and that&#39;s the most unfortunate event ever
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=522">8:42</a> that baby zombie...<br>Although it precedes a fortunate event in Philza&#39;s career
&quot;i would never punch something, if i got mad&quot;<br><b>pewds tambourine convulses in its grave</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=428">7:08</a> Im sorry pls forgive me i have watch all of it :(
Youtube Videos that proceed unfortunate events:
damn i forgot all about corpse party, i remember that i really was scared
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=487">8:07</a> o shit i got my nightmares back. i couldnt watch the whole first episode

What was that anime in the second one
Pewds reacting to gobelin Slayer was great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=103">1:43</a> my friend <br>Ultra Excalibur was in a PewDiePie video I&#39;m proud of him
<b>yells</b><br>Classic<br><b>yells</b><br>Classic<br><b>yells</b><br>Classic<br><b>yells</b>
<b>She just wants some yogurt</b> WCGW
Being called an OG Bro is my highest achievement
What is the image with Pokimane in it I don’t get it
This entire video is Felix screaming or saying classic.
vinland saga has a scene thatd work for this
PewDiePie : I would never punch something <br>Also PewDiePie : <b>punches tamborine when he loses bottle flip challenge with Sean</b>
Carson should be a pic on this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=163">2:43</a> that&#39;s a controversial statement my dude.
I&#39;m happy for Pewdiepie. Like if you agree, champs =)
Miss this guys face

This video gets recommended bc I won’t watch the new stuff bc I can’t see his face
I&#39;m surprised there wasn&#39;t a single image of JFK in his car
The good old days😭
The yogurt.... it isn’t yogurt
What&#39;s with the poki pic. Someone please explain
I hate to admit i do know how the girl gets some yogurt
What’s the Poki one

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=495">8:15</a>
WHAT TF RICHARD?
The Philza one really hit hard
Is this the real Pewds Face? No face reveal yet.
Whenever I need some laughs I just come here. You&#39;re seriously appreciated Felix 😂❤️
Pro tip: If you&#39;re at your boyfriends or girlfriends house and you gotta pee, just play a pewdiepie video in the bathroom. It&#39;ll cover up any pee sounds
Who is this guy? He sounds a lot like PewDiePie

What a very Big Brain Time Title there Pewds?🤔
Gurren lagann is the most anime anime out there
Not knowing what most of these are all i see is Felix looking at an innocuous picture and going &quot;haha, this is funny&quot; before moving on and repeating the same thing many times...
I think I&#39;m going to hell because I know where do you want some yougurt is from...
I think pews is fat now...he not fat? profile pic fat pewds no fat? i am confuse

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=400">6:40</a> I don’t understand
What happens in that shot where the kids are staring at the forest.
Videos that precede unfortunate pandemics...
Daim that call me Carson one has a whole new meaning to it now🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=192">3:12</a> <br><br>A picture taken a day before the aligations
I was waiting for the bridge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=125">2:05</a>
If you know what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=428">7:08</a> is you&#39;re probably on the FBI watchlist.
Been 3 years since I seen a vid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=488">8:08</a> what anime is that and where can I find it? Because now I’m curious.<br><br>Edit: so I looked it up and now I feel this urge to pour bleach into my eyes.
He described every LA Beast video ever lmao
Whats the pokimane one about?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=402">6:42</a> anyone knows this video? Iam really curious about it
What is that thing in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=204">3:24</a> ?????????
The goblin slayer one hit different.

Oye don’t moan at the start of ur videos man
What&#39;s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=399">6:39</a> guys?
Can anyone link with the children staring into the forest unfortunate event? I remember watching it ages and ages ago but can&#39;t remember where I saw it
the shoujo ramune hentai itself is unfortunate that someone made it
Pewds will never understand about the yogurt
<b>Do you want some yogurt?</b> <br>Me : AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Some say gamers don’t cry
Damn this video really made me realize how long I’ve been subscribed to pewdiepie and how old I’ve gotten 😅
Ok
Pewdiepie: “berserk horse scene”<br><br>Me: <b>gets ptsd flashback from being reminded of the existence of Rape Horse</b>
Why does he look like 2018 felix
Doi, oi. Çepato dabo.<br>Dai, ai. Yoii-da, dato. <br>Deieçeto donto. <br>Esko beau ahso. <br>O iought.

I watched your corpse party playthrough back in the day &lt;3 I&#39;m still a MASSIVE fan off the series.
10 minutes 10M views 10k comments
Love to hear that Pewdiepie  watches Internet Historian&#39;s videos
I can’t believe he doesn’t remember neko sugar girls
Pewds be like:<br><b>cmon, if you havent seen tengentopentobgliantoku... what are u doing?</b>
Does somebody know the one at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=488">8:08</a>? Im genuinely curious
Holy shit his laugh is contagious!
The bridge😂😂😂

This was a good video to end 2020 😌
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=424">7:04</a> pewds knows it 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=126">2:06</a> I don’t follow, what unfortunate event happened?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=424">7:04</a> Pewds: what&#39;s wrong with this??? There&#39;s nothing bad<br>Those that knows what next: uhhh...

Goblin slayer first episode will always haunt me forever
THE YOGURT ONE WAS FROM A LOLI HENTAI
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=401">6:41</a> anyone know this image could tell me I&#39;m not interested
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=515">8:35</a> Me realizing pewds lives jn the UK and kids talk like that there all the time:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=423">7:03</a> lmao isn&#39;t this the one with the guy that mouth was randomly stuffed with yogurt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=456">7:36</a> HARAMBE SAMA
Why dont you get youtube creators to buy a new youtube, transfer over to that and leave YouTube behind.
Pewds was a LOT calmer then I was seeing the Goblin Slayer scene. I shut the website down, said &quot;fuck that&quot; and I haven&#39;t watched a second more since.
Why wait for it, when you can do IT YOURSELF 🙃
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=424">7:04</a> he doesn’t know
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=399">6:39</a><br>can anyone tell me what film that is?
I think every uk person  has one response to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=400">6:40</a> <br>Dear god
PEWDS NEEDS TO WATCH GOBLIN SLAYER
What happens in that anime clip?
someone tell me wtf that orc and girl photo is from, Felix&#39;s reactions are too good for it to remain a mystery. I EVEN DID REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH lol and the twitter account doesn&#39;t have it up anymore! Was it that bad?! I must know.
can someone tell me what this image is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=490">8:10</a> ? Can someone send link?

What was the pokimane one?
Like for pewds to do a kingdom hearts play through
Carson and pewdiepie should do a meme review together
Wait. If you have so much money that you&#39;ve basically retired already at 30. Why does it bother you so much to lose rev on ONE video?
the philza minecraft one still hits different
the &quot;do you want some yogurt &quot; image, is illegal<br>(hint) it&#39;s from a loli hentai with VERY young children and a 50-60 yr old man
“I would never punch something if I get mad”<br>Tambourine😐
Guy: <b>Freaks out</b><br>The remote: Adios
fun fact<br>type in guy in the search bar and then first thing you get is guy shoves tv remote
Idk the little kids one
What the...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=235">3:55</a> felix doesn&#39;t know kingdom hearts... im gonna cry
I was waiting for the bridge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=399">6:39</a> can someone please tell me what video this is from
Pewdiepie what is this (Goblin Slayer ptsd insues)
T Series ad on pewds vid?! Wtf
Pewds: I would never punch anything when m angry<br>Tambourine smash!!!!
That danganronpa image hurts
“That was so scary” haha i love that
This is one of the most cursed videos of Pewdiepie EVER
Pewsdipies face before sdeeing what happens in Goblin slayer is an image that precedes an unfortunate event
There was also a Leroy jankins reference in a episode of MacGyver not too long ago
You want some yogurt is the most horrifying one
He was offering a different type of yogurt
Corpse party hit me deep in the pewds nostalgia. Cannot believe how long I’ve been watching this guy lol
so we just gonna ignore the panty and stocking pic in the end? 🤭🤭
I love pewds
Where do I find this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=389">6:29</a>
What happened to the kids looking at the picnic tables?!?
Iam sorry ive been living inside a cave. What was that clip about pokimane?
JÖRGEN
Anime is gay like if u agree
Literally any image from an anime of a teenage girl and a small boy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=300">5:00</a> they predicted Alinity and her cat
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=501">8:21</a> imagine marzia walks in at this moment of all moments.
Images that precede to unfortunate events: <b>dark souls menu screen</b>
&quot;I would never punch something when I get mad&quot;<br>Tambourine: u sure &#39;bout dat
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=293">4:53</a> alinity cat gets revenge 2020 Recolorised

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=430">7:10</a> to anyone who knows this anime see you in hell mate.
I still don&#39;t like how pewds pronounce the anime name like so fast that&#39;s why I get to watch it LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=408">6:48</a> the top one tho
I’ll never forget how intense the corpse party series was
JENKINS not jenkings
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=426">7:06</a> Why do i hear police sirens?
Classic
Pewds collabed with KSI in 2020 btw
Love that this is recommended to me every few months without fail
That doll on your background... i find it highly disturbing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=399">6:39</a> what is the original??
Pewdiepie unironically making fun of &quot;soy culture&quot; kinda makes a complete dickhead
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=428">7:08</a> its fuckin cp man wtf how is even legal i mean srsly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=423">7:03</a> you innocent boy

what anime did he say?
Do you want some yogurt?
that you want some yogurt one got me trembling in my seat, moving into space should throw the fbi off for a litte while
That kingdom hearts one is right before sora stabs himself with the dark key right?<br>Also funniest part about the goblin slayer one is that thats the first episode, and then it maintains a comedic tone for the rest of the series(from what i hear at lest), it doesnt even approach that sort of edge.
I love how I got the psa one immediately.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=424">7:04</a> im scared pls help
Aww I remembered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=646">10:46</a> watching pewdiepie and watching it with my friends then we all screamed together
His reaction to goblin from goblin slayer reminded me of the old two girls one cup reactions.
The bridge scene in pubg...
<b>insert any pulp fiction scene</b>
this is my favorite pewdiepie video idk why

if you dont know about the yogurt you dont know about the yogurt
I didn’t get the pokimaan one
I laughed SO hard at the clip of old pewds getting scared at the game
subcribe to thafnine he runs the account
Felix&#39;s expression before and after finishing Goblin Slayer&#39;s infamous scene is priceless.
on the last one with the food I genuinely felt bad for him
I wish that they showed the image of Felix in the bridge about to say the no no word

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=114">1:54</a> I watched this video to laugh, not get flashbacks.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=526">8:46</a>. Did I cry a little. Yes. But that&#39;s okay.

The intro was an advert? I thought it was some kind of sponsored thing.
I searched for Leeroy Jenkins and apparently there&#39;s a literal army dude writing an article about strategic military perspective on leeroy Jenkins mishaps
The yogurt is a hen hehe

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=55">0:55</a> that quote didnt age well, flash forward when Pewds destroys tamborine becuase he lost bottleflip challenge.
The yogurt one is a Loli hentai
Pewds didn&#39;t watch Jojo back then so he doesn&#39;t know the Billy Mandy epic scene 🤣🤣
The ball pit is from a furry convention. Internet historian made a video on it i recommend ppl to watch, or for pewds to react to it
Pewds face when he knew the truth about goblins in goblin slayer😵🤣
So what happened at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=128">2:08</a>?
This video would have been funny if we were in Felix&#39;s brain.

i laughed so hard at he&#39;s goblin slayer reaction, it was exactly the same as mine XD
The group of kids- I made the mistake of watching crazy ads. I knoe.
People who this scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=425">7:05</a> is going to hell with me
Surprised pewdiepie doesn’t know that infamous scene from goblin slayer.<br><br>Aka, the main reason I’m never watching it cause it does the concept like shit. The manga somehow does it worse by drawing it like full-on fanservice.
Sora comits sepuku
Amazing how he asked for Berserk to be there, but as soon as Goblin Slayer (which is pretty tame in comparison to Berserk) popped up, he went &quot;what&#39;s wrong with anime !?&quot;
how to get more views: put pokimane in your thumbnail
He finally made the Supergirl vid! Hehey!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRgSeOifk7o&amp;t=202">3:22</a> Anyone Saw That Thing Behind Pewds Head
