So much quality on the pitch that night. Very intense match. As a Chelsea fan this makes me sad, seeing Eden Hazard as one of the best players in the world only 5 years ago, and definitely didn&#39;t deserve to lose this game
What happened to umtiti😊
Dobra utakmica ❤😊
❤
This was the real 2018 FIFA World Cup final:<br><br>- The best goalkeepers: Courtois and Lloris<br>- The best players: Hazard and Griezmann<br>- The best young player: Mbappe<br>- The two best national teams: France and Belgium
Hazard was truly a legend in this World Cup 😮❤
جيرو اذهب بعيدًا لانك اسوء مهاجم وتستحق اللعب في الشعله
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=119">1:59</a> sad Lukaku.

What happened to lukaku?
belgium&#39;s golden era was absolutely mesmerizing to watch
The world cup shouldve ended right then and there. So proud of my Belgium.
This was the real Final in 2018 and Belgium in their prime
dont understand this Giroud can actually be France top scorer when he has no skills at all
Imagine doing that dance to score the only goal
this is the belgium I wanted to see in qatar
Every immagrant become national hero if they succeed its international hipocracy
Thank you Belgium 🇧🇪<br>Thank you France 🇫🇷
Poland is going to knockout France this year
I won&#39;t ever get enough of that catwalk strut celebration by Umtiti.  Just brilliant 😅
And now Belgium lost to Morroco by 0-2
i still wish we won that game... belgium vs croatia in the finals wouldve been amazing and unpredicted
Anti rascist thumb nail ❤️
France play well this worldcup
This was the Final that everyone expected
Iconic Celebration from Umtiti 😁
لا إله إلا الله
I remember Belgium&#39;s counter attacks were great. But Frances defence was greater.
Thats the funniest celebration that I seen in a world cup
2002<br>Jul 10
It was a game which had Mbappe, Hazard, Lukaku, De Bruyne, Griezmann etc.. but at the end we see just 1 goal in the game and was scored by Umtiti 😂
i hate that this was not the final. these were the best teams of the tournament
Algeria🇩🇿❤️
Lord umtiti!

umtiti chain rn 😤
Both teams played very well,  but in my opinion Belgium deserved the wc.
I&#39;m hoping the wc champs curse is real this year.... I might&#39;ve jinxed it but still
The two best goal keepers was there.

Belgium was playing as if they weren&#39;t aware it&#39;s fifa semi final... They didn&#39;t put lot many efforts as expected in the semi&#39;s.
Bruh giroud is just useless asf

France is the best dengerous team 🎯🇫🇷🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
France 🇫🇷 vs Belgium 🇧🇪 should of been the Final of 2018 Their play like a final in that match Les Bleus had full control of the game even though Belgium give us a real challenge
France is a cheating king
It should be final . Right ?
One of the greatest robbery by France with the help of referee
Breaks my heart every time I see this and I keep coming back because just to see what we did wrong look how much chances we had but that doesn’t mean I’m very proud what this generation did we come from far very very far we couldn’t qualify for 2010/2006 and now we did this and now it’s coming to a end probably in Qatar thx for everything golden generation <br><br>Ps: the most people in Belgium that watch football hate France now because of this and how they played that game
Belgium was better than France
🇫🇷 &gt; 🇧🇪
Wow

Fun fact from now: This is the last match that Belgium didn’t score

I feel like Belgium deserved reaching the final, they put a fight in the World Cup of 2018, maybe in 2022 it’s Belgium’s time 👀

Belgium barely escaped japan. france was the best allaround team and well deserved champion

In my view, the Belgian national team is a magical national team. Strange, a country that has never won any championship trophies, but can rank 1 in FIFA.
France win
🛄🎮✋🏆🏆
Belgium did its best! from jp

puas hati aq france kalah kt euro tk layak jdi juara belgium lgi layak 😭😭
Euro 2020,, No Umtiti No party.
Actually this was the final
Our king Llorissssss!!!💙🤍❤️
complete template to her honour.  Will England win? Sure, if you look at the armour of the middle flank, however, the England squad haven’t completed the transition of the flannel. I feel Denmark are transitional in the complete approach capacity.
The last goal is saved by courtois which means Belgium but the France enjoys 😂
Wow France as it best world Cup campaign
Back when hazard was fit !
france made a lot of dirty tackles that wasnt counted idk why the refs didnt call them if those fouls were comminted belgium would of gone through
The exultation of the French always very sober, see pogba&#39;s exultation against Switzerland in the Eurooeum 2020😂

Hopefully Belgium will win Euro 2021 but they have to get past Portugal, Italy, France and England/Germany/Holland in the final.<br>Ultimately whoever comes out of Belgium&#39;s side of the draw will deserve to win it.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=74">1:14</a> is no one going to talk about how amazing that pass was

In the last 6 7 years, Belgium has become a formidable national team in European football.
This should of been the final

France is anti football. Everybody knows it!
Thanks for the video
La célébration de Umtiti est légendaire.
Sad seeing what happen to umtiti. No games in barcelona. No call up for france =(
Who wants see them in euro 2020 final 😍😍😍
France win a WC on your own merit. Not with foreigners
Idk if you know but france losed because they then can play to ez countrys and win better

In what universe do you not include the clock in highlights? FIFA is garbage.

Somebody like Kane wouldn&#39;t have missed that Tolisso&#39;s shot
Debruyne play was out of the world in this match.
Umtiti
Everybody talks about allison, Ederson, neuyer, oblank, de gea and curtois. But nobody talks about lloris, the most underrated goal keeper in the contemporary football.
belgium deserve to go through but france got it
Belgium was robbed. France should&#39;ve lost.
I like Matuidi&#39;s celebration.. 😁
Belgium was the worthy of WC<br>But france was the underdogs and bit Lucky too

France vs Belgium is actually a final match for me. Sorry crotia.
When u realize that the referee was a great fan of France&#39;s team
Alley lay bloa lol.
Having Watched The Belgium Vs France Semifinal match, It was really a battle of Goal keepers and Finally it was The French Goal Keeper who did most of the Saves and therefore won The Match
France cheated
Malaysia 🇲🇾
what skill at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=678">11:18</a>
Such a wasted chance by Oliver Giroud. He was too slow to strike. That pass by Mbappe was unbelievable
One Thing I Liked The Most about France Vs Belgium Semifinal match was that unforgettable Wink given by one of the French Female fans - What a Lovely Wink!
Hay que ser payaso para meter un gol en una semifinal de Mundial y celebrarlo así

Why did you cut out the disgusting time wasting Mbappe did at the end?
They dont let see that mbappe shoot the ball away when belgium have a chance
MBAPPEEEEEEEEEEE
Belgium was the best team of wc 2018
I was as delighted for France as I was devastated for Belgium. Belgium was the best team in that WC, but France had the rage and indomitable spirit of fearless teenagers!
Brazil
Now it&#39;s time to move the borders 😂🤣🤣
Goalkeeping at its best
That pass from Mbappe to Giroud was pure perfection; pristine,🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=74">1:14</a> brilliant
It&#39;s more like Africa team  a vs team b.
This was the World Cup final for me
This is the final Croatia 0-5 Belgium
This remindes me of the spain vs germany semi final at 2010<br>The team that won also won the world cup: check<br>1:0 : check<br>A defender scored in a corner: check<br>The loser won the next world cup: maybe??????
France vs France Mini
This win was less deserved than Spain against the Netherlands in 2010
Worst match.
This was the true final
Lucky for us Croats we didn&#39;t get Belgium in semi finals. Belgium deserved atleast 2nd place.
Giroud is bad
Come here to see umtiti walk again 😂

If Belgium could’ve won this match. This would’ve been another Spain-Netherlands match. Meaning 2 nations who’ve never made it to final in their own countries history.<br>Both France and Netherlands made it to final its 3 times apiece France wins 2/3 finals and Netherlands 0/3
Belgium was better
Bravo Samuel 👏👏👏💪

Umtiti is being marked by Fellaini still scores. You also need luck to be the world champions.
Mbappe’s pass there tho, crazy
Hazard was the best player during wk 2018 no cap
Breaks my heart every time &lt;/3
It would have been wonderful to watch Belgium vs Croatia WC Final!!

belgium deserved that World Cup, they were playing so well, high-level team, and hazard was doing his thing. France was a fair winner, but Belgium should&#39;ve  won that
Umtiti FC
We love umtiti ❤️
Back when griezmann was fire🔥
What a game
Pogba <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=62">1:02</a> xd
I just found out who will be the champion of the next World Cup<br>Come with me! In 2010, Spain eliminated Germany 1-0 with a header from a defender (Puyol) and was champion. In 2014, Germany also eliminated France with a 1-0 goal from a defender (Hummels) and was also champion of that Cup. In 2018, France eliminated Belgium 1-0 with a header from a defender (Umtiti) and was also champion. These 3 teams were eliminated with a goal from the head of a defender and in the following World Cup they were champions. Therefore, everything indicates that the next cup that will win will be Belgium ....<br>It will be??
can&#39;t for 2022 world cup <br>but fuking covid man
ACHETE
Umtiti And PoGba 😂😁🔥😍
France dusn&#39;t desurf that winning.

The Real world cup final
WHY NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW DISRESPECTFUL MBAPPE ,COME ON ,I HATE HIM
Upsetting that these two drew each other it would have made a great final
El arquero de francia me recuerda a fabien bartez otro buen arquero

The true final
France was lucky they had an amazing Hugo Lloris, otherwise the outcome would have been different.
Belgium deserved the world cup.

Why is this &quot;highlight&quot; video so short? <br>Ask france
Lloris won the world cup for France
See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=77">1:17</a> it was hand of Belgium defender
Umtiti the GOAT

Similarities between 2014 and 2018 World Cup is that there first semi final were equivalent to final<br><br>2014- Brazil vs Germany (Everyone predicted that this will be the final)<br><br>And<br><br>2018 France vs Belgium
Respect belgium who had fought back against japan then winning against brazil 👏🏽
France woulsnt have even qualified if all the African players played for their original country

Undeserved. This was like Spain&#39;s 1-0 scores at the world cup 2010.
Everyone talking about that pass from Mbappe to Giroud at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=74">1:14</a> is just UFFFFF🔥🔥🔥
How heroic lloris

Umtiti was a top CB before his injury
Le seum.
When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2018 because the market outburst in December 2017 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2018 it didn&#39;t work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.<br>I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform.<br>Here is his contact via <br>Email Address:Ronsonbaylor @gmail .com<br>Tele gram: @Expert_Baylorfx<br>WhatsApp: ☎️+ 1 5 0 9 3 4 2 7 0 7 7.

Belgium are one of my favourite national teams but im still happy france won because im part french
Wondering what ever happened to umtiti after this world cup
De scheidsrechter was super partijdig naar Frankrijk toe. Het was super oneerlijk
Pogba could have had like 3 assists in this game
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=61">1:01</a>
2 best teams for this world cups😌
England were a joke in the WC. A complete waste. They almost lost to Colombia lol. :v What a final Belgium vs France would have been! Croatia did their best but they were just too exhausted by the time the finals came. If only Belgium had lost to England, that would have made the amazing 2018 WC even more surprising and unpredictable!
BOTH TEAM PLAYERS, PLAYED POWERFUL, STAMINA FULL,  TECHNICAL FULL AND STRONG GAME, SOME ONCE IS EXTRAORDINARY AND SOME ONCE IS SUPER EXTRAORDINARY............. <br>BUT WINER IS WONDERFUL............

My favorite team Belgium and their captain hazard who is my fav player did not make it to the final
😘♥️🇫🇷🇫🇷🎉🎊⭐⭐
Why has Fifatv refused to put out the full match
Who watch 2021🙌🏻
Yes
France was so hard to deny Courtois
So it means 🇩🇰 Denmark is better then 🇧🇪 Belgium because they doesn&#39;t conceeded a goal against 🇫🇷 France 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I come from the future Varane left Hazard without a World Cup and Now Without Champions
Brazil had 59% possession &amp; 27 (9 on target) shots...But Belgium won with the help of an own goal...
im hoping for a revenge in the nations leageu
This was the true world cup final
Revenge in the nations leauge 🇧🇪🇧🇪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=85">1:25</a> beautiful tackle

This was a match between goalkeeper s!
I wanted to see Croatia V  Belgium

Hazard was sensational for this whole tournament, a shame his teammates disappeared in this match else they&#39;d have a World Cup.
To this day I still believe Belgium would’ve won without mbappes time wasting
Umtiti
This match should be in final
Belgium 🇧🇪 bad luck, 0-1.....
At least Courtois save Belgium from a huge defeat.....
This was the Real Final.

I see a malaysian flag
This was the real final
We didn&#39;t see much goal but the toughness and environment of the match was at another level
N&#39;Golo Kante 2016 leads Leicester City to a premier league title. <br>N&#39;Golo Kante 2017 leads Chelsea FC to a premier league title. <br>N&#39;Golo Kante 2018 leads France to a world cup title. <br><br>Amazing to think any team thought they stood a chance against France when N&#39;Golo Kante was playing. xD!!
A bit bored world cup
The worst world cup in the history
Can you see the Malaysia flag?
If belguim lost to england in the group stages they would probably reached the final
where is the full match ? france vs belgium<br>tanks
I was predicting Belgium to win the World Cup bruh

Belgium great team all the time always reach knockout stage
France 19 shoots <br>Belgium just 9 .<br>Too bad that France scored just 1 goal.
Look at that accuracy 92% i lost it 😂😂
Belgium was no doubt the best team of the world cup 2018! That goal of france was just lucky. Belgium should’ve won 🇧🇪🇧🇪
Hurts to watch this match
Umtiti.
I was a big fan of Belgium but unfortunately they didn&#39;t make it to the final
Belguim was too bad france gave them somting they want
Without Hugo Lloris they couldn&#39;t have made it to Final and Belgium Would be the World Champion
I just noticed every match in the 2018 World Cup is 2 minutes and 10 seconds 😂
This was the real final of the World Cup.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=73">1:13</a>

Jokes about Umtiti start!
In 2020.... when i watch that match i feel very sad.....love u Belgium.... they played very well....best of luck 2022... love from Bangladesh....
France is my favorite team in football
Africa vs Africa (with a few exceptions)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=74">1:14</a> that pass from Mbappe was brilliant
Belgium played better than France..just too much reliance on hazard..
Hugo Lloris won for them <br>I mean just Lloris <br>Captain himself to the rescue

And I still think belgium was the best club in the World Cup..

This should have been the real final lol, it was fell matched, a contest between the two best teams.
Sad for belgium, this is their golden generation... hazard, de bruyne, Lukaku, witsel, courtois..
Courtois is still crying, so does Hazard :D
BEST GAME EVER !!!!
This must be the final

Probably should&#39;ve been the final. I&#39;m English and was naturally going for the Three Lions and Croatia were the people&#39;s champions but France and Belgium were the real teams of the tournament.
Just look at the skill of mbappe

Giroud funnyman Paul
Je continue a venir ici régulièrement pour boire des larmes de belges hahaha 😂
I think Argentina played better than Belgium against France
Mbappe es el nuevo pele de francia
Quoiqu&#39;en disent les belges, posséder le ballon plus longtemps que l&#39;adversaire ne signifie pas que l&#39;on domine et que l&#39;on aurait mérité de gagner. C&#39;est juste la résultante de choix tactiques. Les Français jouent en contre, ce qui implique ipso facto de laisser la possession du ballon à l&#39;adversaire.

What a click bait.. It’s Belgium vs Africa !
Im from belgium, belgium had some top players in their team. But if you look at the french team every player is top class.
Still belgium is far better than France...🇧🇪
Why is nobody talking about how INSANE Hugo Lloris was?
Which country is that McDonald&#39;s team?
Sheh.
:....(
Im convinced that if Fellaini had used some hair wax which makes the hair hard, it would have blocked Umtiti’s header
Watching this in July 2020  it still.... Breaks my heart....... Hazard 🖤🖤
Commentator: after the goal France now can sniff the world cup final. 😂
I think Belgium deserve to proceed to the WC final and Belgium are better than Croatia France conceded 4 goals , on Belgium one goal
Belge me
Los mundiales cada vez son peores. Poquísimos goles en instancias decisivas y cuando convierten son de córner.
Is it just me, or watching in slow or frame-by-frame at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=68">1:08</a>, was this actually just an own-goal? Appears to me it hits Fellaini&#39;s head then arm, and the ball only redirects after it&#39;s past Umtiti&#39;s head. &lt;shrug&gt;
why you bully me
Belgium deserved to win the World Cup. I mean, look at all those games they played in this tournament, insane!

Lord Giroud🤐
Les belges insistent, d&#39;après eux ils se sont fait voler le match , d&#39;après moi l&#39;EDF a fait ses preuves depuis longtemps , les belges s&#39;en sortent bien , le score aurait pu être plus sévère , ils ont éviter le 3 a zéro
GIROUD IL ABUSE 🤣🤣🤣
France stil played false
Varane&#39;s world cup was awesome
Its sad that france just slowed everything down at the end so they would be sire to win otherwise belgium would win against croatia definitely
Umtiti! 😃
it was more a final then Croatia vs. France
whomakes the goal?<br>Me: Umtiti
J’étais tendax comme un string pendant ce match
Giroud messed up everything
Giroud
I was rooting for Belgium and Croatia
দারুণ
That Mbappe flick to Giroud was Zidane-esque
All saying France should have won the 2016 final it is true but it is also true that they didn’t deserve to win the semi final against Germany in 2016 and neither this semi final against Belgium and even more in the final against Croatia there first two goals were not legit and with 1-0 for Croatia at half time the match could have been different
I watched all summaries of the year 2020
Deberían subir el partido completo entre Bélgica vs francia <br>They should upload the full match between Belgium vs France

I can not believe how big this game was. You have two of the best nations. Belgium with their golden generation  and Frances new Golden generation.
Para mi concepto, Francia tenía un mejor equipo en 2018 que el de hace 20 años atrás.
Realmente bien merecido que francia gane se nota que jugaban con amor todo muy felices de verdad celebrando cada gol.

ALLEZ LES BLEUS💙❤
Allez Les Bleus great job with the victory against Belgium!!<br>We enjoyed watching the match between France and Belgium at the semi-finals!!<br>At second half, Umtiti made a heading goal which brought France into the finals to take the trophy!!!
Ce match a clairement été le meilleur de la compétition. Dans son enjeu, ses arrêts, ses actions. Vraiment la France et la Belgique sont les deux équipes phares de la CDM 2018

Back to back world cups where Belgium are in eliminated in 1-0 heartbreak fashions. They’re always so close but I think this time in the next World Cup they will win it. Had Belgium defeated Argentina I believe they go on and beat Germany in the final. Against France that was the final, Croatia didn’t give them fits like Belgium did
Best game
Tout manière le meilleur joueur c&#39;est Giroud je veux rien entendre

France was the worst winner that I have ever seen. <br>It played an anti-football.

I am happy Belgium DESTROYED by FRANCE
The 1986 team or 2018 team. Preudhomme, Scifo, Gerets. 50/50
the replay does not show how much pressure Belgium put on France at the beginning
This should’ve been the final

AAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAAA LETS GOOOO
Best Game
Michal Jackson: I am the best dancer.                        Umtitti: hold my soccer ball
Someone tell me what about Samuel&#39;s goal was lucky
France got lucky this world cup
Kompany. Hazard. Their keeper. I so adore Belgium. Yeah yeah am French and of course loved watching the boys win it all. But so loved Belgium if I were king of the world would have declared them co-champs.
Red devil were destroyed by France for there first goal.
I see Malaysian 🇲🇾 flare
Franc ka ak plye forwd tik ny h
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=74">1:14</a> would have been assist of the tournament by Mbappe for sure ...
The french didnt play fair tho
I love the announcer
We all know whoever won this match was winning the World Cup...
France is the best team of this Wm
Sangat bagus
they forgot the part where mbape stole the ball because he got scared from us
Wish this was the finals
we all knew whoever wins this match was the country to lift the cup
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=1">0:01</a> My girlfriend in bed
France :<br>Lloris<br><br>Defense (and I include Kante and other MD) <br><br>Fast players, fast runners and passes : Pogba, Griezmann or Mbappew<br><br>Giroud, a centre back playing centre forward. Useful as a target man and defending set pieces but has no idea on how to score goals 🤔
Lloris was a beast in this wc
That goal celebration made me lol
Anyone know who the commentator is?
Belgium should have won this match
This is own goal, sucks.
Minute 1 i feel so pain 🇧🇪

Belgium: NO YUO CANT WIN GAINST US WE FAVORITES WE HAVE HAZARD AND WITZEL<br>France: Haha ball go zoom zoom
Lloris is amazing ...underrated  player in France....if he is not in form ...Belgium  will win this match for sure
Kok ada bendera malaysia di belakang gawang
❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=60">1:00</a> mother<br>the food arrives
Alderwielded : I’m gonna hit a goal <br>Llorris: sorry bro just go back to defense
Who has the best ever goal celebration?<br>Ans : Umtiti
Mbappe is a legend
I loved every match of france IN 2018 WC  except  MATCH against Agrentina i cried for Messi  though congrats france Argentina wasnot sure they wouldnot defeat croatia in the final ....so france was better option ...all the way from Nepal....
wow french team tough
Lloris deserved the Golden gloves!
aaaaahhhh ça fait du bien de regarder cette vidéo en ce moment<br>quelle belle coupe du monde
Samuel Umtiti ♥
Samuel Umtiti ♥
Belgium? 🤔 A little bit overrated.

Tottenham fan sees Lloris denies Toby: 🤨🤨🤨
Both played Amazing. Awesome match.
Notice how in 2010, 2014, and 2018 the country knocked out in the semi-finals 1-0 due to a header goal ends up winning the next world cup?
&quot;Frafrica&quot; deserved the cup
Hay la figura fue el arquero lloris que mbappe ni que nada muy sobrevalorado si no hubiera sido por lloris que tapó el gol de Paolo guerrero Perú estaría con ventaja en el primer tiempo
This was the final, warriors till the end. ❤️🔥
France 1-0 Belgium France go on to on to win it

I don&#39;t  know why roberto martinez didn&#39;t included mertens and carrasco in the starting 11. Mertens and carrasco was only introduced in the late 2nd half. When mertens was brought in he was playing really wonderfull in curve crosses .
next world cup will be last chance for belgium to win world cup with this team. after that they will be mediocre again

Finally the first time two African nations are in a World Cup Semi Final.
France 😘👌♥️🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
Belgium was just a power house team this World Cup. No disrespect but I was shocked they lost to France. Belgium was the best team and just had an off day. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Best action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntQsMSuEbyg&amp;t=50">0:50</a> 😂😂😂
Wow
Belgium will win next world cup.
the semifinals cant be a &quot;world cup&quot;  i would call it &quot;european cup&quot;
Imagine if Belgium won a world cup before Netherlands it would have been some shame.

Belgium was the most difficult rival for France in the knock out round of this World Cup...
Great game
