So if crackers don‚Äôt belong in the fridge but chocolate does, what about a chocolate coated cracker. Checkmate.
Blobfish are actually really cute little fish when they haven&#39;t been decompressed from their very deep dark down under home. They look like that gelatinous blob because their flesh basically explodes and puffs up when it&#39;s taken out of the very high pressure environment it lives in. And they&#39;re way cuter than sunfish.

A 100mil youtuber saying , more cameras means better phone , is soo sad

That guy woke up, maybe exercised, maybe made his bed, showered, made breakfast, made his coffee, drove into the studio, met up with his coworkers, talked about the plans for the shoot that day, then took his shirt off and layed his face in a cake. We&#39;re living in a society.

Chocolate does not belong in the fridge, you monster. Obviously you don&#39;t understand the connection between temperature and flavor profile.
How do you live in the uk and not know who David Tennant is ?

GEnuine question, of the literall 100 million of you, does anyone actually have an honor pro? I&#39;m considering the idea of a new phone, since the one i have is 5 years old and I could use an upgrade.
Im a simple man. I see a huawei phone, I like.
Japanese commercials are just stock images as ads.
chocolate belongs in the pantry. The freezer is too cold for cocoa butter
Did just you call David Tennant a c list celebrity?
These photos makes no sense!
Is it just me or is lazarbeams video the exact same as this one?
I even enjoy pewds doing ads, wth
i tried not to blink after a while my eyes started watering. Welp i guess i suck my pp through ham \:
Burger has no gender because burger is gender
Literally got an ad for a stock photo company in this video  :/
Chocolate does belong in the fridge. It weirds me out when my bf just leaves his out....but he also does this with drinks. He&#39;ll take one sip, sit it on the counter and walk off for hours... I cannot explain how much this boggles me.

<b>Title:</b> Stock Images needs to be Stopped!<br><b>Pewds right into the video:</b> &quot;Stock photos is a national treasure. Stock photos need to be preserved at all costs.&quot;
A funny thing is that i got an ad from Adobe Stock Photos
If pewds recorded his footage with his honor 20 pro, we would have waaaaaaaaay better video.
chocolate belongs in frige  d  (i didnt know where the d went so I left it on the side)
I mean, robbing the bakery with a baguette. She&#39;s really bringing home the Dough..
Getting hit with a baguette would be pretty painful.
Chocolate does not belong in the fridge.
i&#39;m gonna buy a honor phone.<br>BUT NOT THAT ONE YIKES YOUR ADVERTISING DOESNT WORK
Now Cocomelon&#39;s &quot;wash your knees&quot; make sense
quarantine is very very very boring i hate this
Excellent advice!! I count myself to be successful in stock trading because of the amazing strategy of Mr Samuel Raphael
Did you know that the blob fish we see in most pictures are of them after they literally throw up their organs and lose their pigment. Ya
Pewds scream at the blobfish was too funny and too cute üòÇ
Will Furrell?  That&#39;s Steve Carell.  And it&#39;s Ferrell.  But also good vid.
i thought that the iphone was so fricking ugly with all the cameras but<br>honestly<br>the honor phone thing organized the cameras to where they make the phone look a bit better<br>gg
Felix, you missed the opportunity to say that if you get shot with a baguette he would be in &quot;pain&quot; because &quot;pain&quot; is bread in french and baguettes are french.
felix: &quot;I know we&#39;ve all put our peepee through there, don&#39;t say yes just blink&quot; <br>me: <b>blinks</b>  <br>         &quot;but I don&#39;t have a peepee&quot;<br><br><b><i>confused screaming</i></b>

Chocolate is better cold....but American chocolate is nothing compared to Belgium chocolate....so I&#39;m sure most people just think all chocolate taste like Hershey&#39;s lol
Ok I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late to comment but.. I cant help but notice. Look at the teeth in the eye stock photo. Now look at the bottom row of teeth carefully. I think I just discovered I have a tooth phobia. There are too many teeth, and I&#39;m frightened. <br> (Ps, sorry person who&#39;s teeth those are.)

I feel like it isn&#39;t really photography if its full of obnoxious edits. People looking for stock photography don&#39;t want it to be already edited into oblivion. Maybe people are using stock photo websites as photoshop portfolios

Dumping the disabled woman into the pool is an old joke.  He asks her why she&#39;s crying, and she says she&#39;s never been kissed.  So he kisses her, and then she&#39;s still sad because she&#39;s never been fucked.  So he throws her in the pool and says &quot;Now you&#39;re fucked&quot;.

Chocolate does not belong in the fridge unless you plan on letting it warm up for 20 minutes or so before eating it or the weather is very warm. Chocolate should be consumed at room temperature, that is to say around 18-22C degrees, because the closer it gets to its melting point, which is roughly the temperature of the inside of your mouth, the more flavour notes can be detected. In other words cold chocolate does not taste as good as slightly warmer chocolate. Cold temperatures also affect  chocolate texture.
Lol the salad pics

I‚Äôm glad to know I bought a jacket and gave you money to throw spaghetti in a forest
I am currently holding my eyes open to prove I didn&#39;t put my thing in the dvd disk player
It&#39;s not that lucrative because it&#39;s so easy to do. Way too much competition. Although some can have a successful career through stock photography, the vast majority do not make that much money.
Wait, William Osman didn&#39;t even reply to you?

I know this probably wont be seen because its super late to the video,  but artists are why weird stock videos exist. As someone who draws i wouldnt call myself an artist, but i do use stock photos for art refrence. They are very helpful for figuring out how things look together. And people who draw, draw weird things.

The baguette is past its expiration date
