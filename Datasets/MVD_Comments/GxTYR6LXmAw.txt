Hahaha! I always used to joke about there one day being a Nike Water and not Nike Air!
They should make ZamZam ones for Muslims 🤔

The fact that u step on holy water is a blasphemy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=55">0:55</a> Treasure of Nadia Overworld Theme😂😂😂
Lil has x 😂❤ he’ll no<br>I need the Jesus ones
Nike : Thanks Ozark for the few drops of water 💦 👍😂🤣
boy, this looks like a chinese shoe with a defect embedded by mistake (bubbles inside coz a machining failure :-D  ) but, lets go for the practical benefits of these bubbles  - &quot;water&quot; - how possible is this to be compressed from a human weight - well.. at least the entire structure can expand at some point.. BUT adding air - well - this can be compressed :-D
soo you pay $800+ or more for water what is the world come to
Lil Nas X disliked this video
what about the stripper with golf fish heels? been done before and better nike!
This was made to Counteract the Satan Shoes.
worse than satan shoes imo
Imagine a water edition of every Airmax
Me :Mom he walks on water!<br>Mom : who? <br>Me : <br>Mom : where&#39;s my broom stick.
C’mon guys let’s get rid of the HOLY WATER and just focus on the kicks! (They really are a nice pair of trainers)......NIKE AIR MAX 97 💯❤️👍🏾
1,000
hello. Are they original or copie? I&#39;ve got one but i don&#39;t know how can I spot them. Thanks
DRIP
Isn&#39;t it disrespecting Jesus to wear him as a shoe?
Water max
You literally cannot wear this shoes without walking like a God.
They are water max
lixo
That’s cool.
Imagine walking up to church with these bad boys. Jit bouta have the holiest drip at church ong
Imagine wearing this and the santan shoes
Naw there’s no difference from lil nas X version … that’s crazy they even put blood on the tung with the crucifix..
Yet again, Christianity is used for its true purpose. Commercialization and profiteering.
The stupidest shoe I have ever seen in my life
Stupidest looking man I have ever seen in my life
You can pick those ugly shoes and shove Up the Wazoo
What is ugly looking shoe
The cross represent sex worshyp Jesus in number in Greek ys 666 the name op the beast in latin mean earth pig comes hebrew that mean abomination correcty Yahushua Rew (REV;13
I&#39;m gonna buy these shoes if I have to hurt myself for it❤️
They have a stain 🥲
Jesus shoes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=214">3:34</a> literally had no clue what he just said 🤣
Would these be acceptable as church shoes?
Hi. A quick question. Does India make Nike shoes?
Me on Nike by you
they&#39;re fake. the water needs put in the AJ retro 1s. My reasoning is that you can&#39;t see holiness and admittedly they were banned like christianity occultism should be :D fuck your casadro right mike?
I love that when you took off Cross when you wear ❤️❤️❤️
Love it .. really nice gesture ..
Oh my holysneakers
God.. let me go back.. Oct 8th 2019.
Ok hear me out, what iiif what if they had coca cola inside of them?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=217">3:37</a><br>Song name
Ah…perfect for all of my christian Hypebeasts
I really want them
it is just a shoe filled with water .....what is soooooo special about them ?????????
This is not real
The Pope Francis should get these
Liquid, contrary to gas, is non compressible. Kinda defeats the functionality of the cushion.
The father at my church wears these 😭
African kids looking at this😧
When the bubble pops I guess it will be more obvious when there’s no water left in them 🤣🤣
100cc ink with 1 drop of holy water
Nike Water Max
i have holy water from jordan
That is… this is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.<br><br>Yea people are gonna look at you alright, they’re gonna look at you and think, does that idiot have water shoes?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=225">3:45</a> reminded me of the meme sound  lol!
Nike really said lets do a collab with jesus
water in air bubblee
I like the Satan shoes better
all fun and games til that water evaporates lmfao
When it pops?
When li nas x became vegian
It’s a colab with Jesus.
I ever get a job at an young age I&#39;m saving my money for these shoes.
I love Jesus with all my heart but u don’t put Jesus on shoes <br>And the Satan shoes is wrong u don’t follow the devil don’t sell ur soul to the devil. <br>It’s just wrong
i&#39;ll just take my vaccine tube-thingy and inject some water in my 97&#39;s and then its all gucci for me
A bo o a wa o
HOLY SHOWS THEY ARE BLESSED WITH HOLY WATER
I had to come back to this because I know a blessed mother that got these as a gift not even knowing what they were or the cost. only that they are very comfortable on her weary feet. I hope they really did bless the shoes because she is a wonderful person and deserves no less than good things.
Jesus shoes
They look comfortable!🔥
do you think it&#39;s beautiful atheist? are you going to buy son of a bitch?
I have a pair of those, my friends call them air jesus.
God bless you
I hate NIKE and will never buy a pair tell the day I die ...... way over priced .... way to many types of shoes ..... ugly colors ..... and Made In CCP ....... fook China !
The air max bein filled with air is better than with water because the particles in air are far apart and the particles in the water are more closely packed so it wont feel as comfortable as air
Jesus signature shoes look out Michael Jordan 😂
HELLO UNBOX THERAPY,<br>THIS SNEAKER IS NOT 1400USD WORTH<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=264">4:24</a> Check the Laces on TOP! see the RED thing? :D
Is the water drinkable ?
Better than the blood ones
Now this is drip not that kaka Satan shoes
That&#39;s disrespect I&#39;m not Christian but the cross is on the shoes which makes it very disrespectful
too expensive ~
this a collab.. blah blah blah..
Wotah
Idk why but after watching the unboxing of lil nas&#39; satan shoes, it made me feel heavy. <br><br>While watching this, i kinda feel better aaaa. I hated the energy that was transmitted to me by the satan shoes.
lil nas x got owned
Why would it say &quot;mischief&quot; on the inner sole (soul)? Hmmm, these shoes may not appear as they seem.
Its holy water the satan shoes got human blood
Fire hella fire
I want them!
Jesus Christ love you<br>Jesus Christ love you
When Jesus comes back he coming pack in these kicks
Not just &quot;water&quot;  it&#39;s &quot;holy water&quot;
imagine wearing these with the lil nas x shoes
Lil nas x after putting a drop of blood into each shoe only for people to burn it
I would do lil nas x demon shoe on the left and the Jesus shoe on the right while going out
Fun fact: That&#39;s the holy water in Jesus shoes
Soo disrespectful to Jesus.
You should be stepping on a cross ( inside) every time you take a step
parce coma mierda como así, se trata de un video de Nike y lleva una gorra de Adidas
Everyone say they hated satan shoes but secretly you want them
I swear that guy with the computer sitting down looks almost identical to my GTA Online character
So touching the jesus scriptures and holy water with foot people dont have any problem
Does it have holy water?
Idol worshipping
I live in Jordan 🇯🇴
I want these!!! But I don’t think they sell anymore 😩😩😩 especially after the lil nas x court case 😭😭😭
I wish I had these shoes
Those are my dreamsuit I really want to walk on water with them!!!!!!!!!!
White colorways are always clean, especially with some light colors to flair em up.
Stranded in Dessert <br>wearing Nike with Water<br>shoe: SACRAFICE
I may wear this on my left leg and the satan shoes on right leg together but i don’t have either of them
If you unlike that means you are satanic
Really....... WEARING JESUS CHRIST ON FOOT..... I guess that&#39;s not acceptable..
Why did you take Jesus out of the title!?!
It&#39;s a sin to be stepping on holly water
Daaaaammmn those are tight af!!! I want those!! 🔥 🔥
Lil nas x should be sewed for copyright
Am gonna buy the holy and the satan shoes and wear holy shoe on right and satan shoe on left lol
It’s holy water

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=265">4:25</a> shoe lase under check mar on soul is already stained
Holly water
That&#39;s called disrespect like putting those feets on  that holy water? Plus that holy cross  Like what the heck
Hahaha did lil nas x do this on purpose
It’s crazy how theirs only one on sale on google &amp; sadly it’s on poshmark
Imagine if you buy both the this and the satan shoes and you wear this on the right and satan on the left now that will be cool thanos will be like: perfectly balanced as all things should be.
normal air max 97: $80 <br>After adding water: $1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Jesus: 😐
Jesus uses Nike
Jesus is the best
Lame
Unpopular opinion - satan shoes look cooler
What would you rather have satan shoes or Jesus shoes
Not to forget the pump systems from Reebok or back then I think from LA Gear or LA Tech there were these flashing shoes every time you stepped out they flashed.  They were absolutely cool for kids.
Fuck the lil nas x shoes we need this
it hurts my ears listening you talkin about shoes, just like the previous video i watched about the J&#39;s why would you say maybe MJ should have retired earlier....  ttcttctc
THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN LIL NAS SHOES
imagine wearing one of those to ur church
If you worship the holy water, why wear it in your feet and disrespect it.
I loved it
Better than the satan shoes ngl
I injected 💉 red liquid in mine back in 2000. Ppl always had to ask. I Called it The devil&#39;s 😈 Kick.
We respect Jesus in the name of lord
I HOPE GOD BLESS EVERYONES DAY🥰🥰🥰🥰
GOD IS OUR LORD 👑👑👑 AND SAVIOUR🥰🥰🥰
GOD LOVES YOU ALL🥰🥰🥰🥰
I don’t get it...I’m not even Christian and I genuinely am offended by this. Isn’t your beliefs/religion something that is sacred? Shouldn’t be respected and not be used for entertainment purposes?  I don’t know man. You guys are too liberal.
Man I&#39;ma put holy water in em myself bro with food coloring and Fiji water
Why you got the Jesus sneaks? You don&#39;t even believe in Jesus&quot;
Nike will never redeem itself with me after the nas shoes
Imagine wearing one jesus shoe and on another feet satan shoe. Holy shit that would be sick 😳

Imagine dying and going to heaven and seeing Jesus casually welcoming you at the gate with these pieces on
It&#39;s worthless to wear these in India,people won&#39;t be able to differentiate between the real ones and the fake one..
Why call it airmax its watet max lol
The Jesus drip

Imagine wearing this one on the one foot and the lil nas x shoe on the other one
it&#39;s all fun and games until Jesus vs satan distract each other with drip
He’s holy now
how was this uploaded 3 years ago
Why would you pay to have air max with essential an air leak ? Surly they are just ripping you off ! Your paying for air but they’ve half filled the air portion with water . Should be called Nike air half’s
that&#39;s Nike WaterMax
This video title used to have Jesus in it right?
Hey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=39">0:39</a> that code is a verse from the cristian bible

who else got pissed when he untied the dead stock lases
Why I love this channel? I love it because it&#39;s not a sneaker channel yet he gets the best sneakers for review... better than all the sneaker channels lmao 🤣
If those smells good like water and frankincense and myrrh they put thought into those then they should put some brimstone and sulfur in the devil&#39;s for more theatrical appeal like more thought process they both beautiful and go hard.

So you’re not gonna comment on the beautiful cross? You even got rid of it.
I wanna see a cross between these and the Satan shoes for the ultimate war under each step, plus if they find a way to put red and blue fluids in the same midsole using fluids that won&#39;t blend so they always swirl then repel each other would be really dope
What about lil nas shoes
Who all is watching this video after seeing lil nas x shoes?
If you wear a jesus shoe and a satan shoe what will happen
Now you gotta review the Lil Nas X shoes. 😂😅
Sheeesshhhhh🥶🥶🥶
Yoo I want an Orthodox Version though
Lets go zam zam water, who ever steps on someone with the shoes they get cured by islam
I&#39;m here cause of Lil nas X shoes
If you buy this you&#39;ll instantly go to Heaven
Amen now I know Nike loves god
Me running away from the Lil nas devil shoes someone give me a holy water shoes Now I am holy
God sent His only begotten son to this world for you(John3:16). <br>He so dearly loves you and wanted a relationship with mankind that He sent Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour, to this earth to cleanse us from all sin and restore the brokenness of man’s relationship with God. He died on the cross for our sins and freedom - that we may have eternal life (Jn 3v16) and three days later resurrected - just as prophesied previously in the Bible to show how He conquered death for us!(1 Corinth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=955">15:55</a>-57)<br>All He wants is you. Ask Him to forgive you, cleanse you from sin through the blood of His precious son Jesus, come into your heart and you’ll feel joy and peace like no other. I pray that you’ll never be the same and that you’ll feel and deeply know and understand the love of God from this day forward! In Jesus’ mighty and precious name. Amen.🙏🏾 I love you and God loves you much much more.<br>I also urge you to pray always (1 Thess <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=317">5:17</a>) and read the Bible as often as you can to develop your relationship with God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and to know Him more. Stay blessed.❤️

Now this is the shoes I want then the lil nas x satan shoe
Better than lil nas shoes
Brother pray for forgiveness if you ever wore this  shoe.  You&#39;re  literally  walking on water. They&#39;re mocking Jesus, it&#39;s blasphemous to pretend to be Jesus and attempt to walk on water.
Came here to wash my eyeballs after seeing the ones Lil Nas created
I want those so bad
For people saying “theyre mocking god” by saying walk on water you’re literally walking on holy water from the river Jordan
I felt sick after seeing lil nas x shoes so I HAD to see if there was a jesus shoe ... this look good I might buy them
Thaught this was new
Who all came to watch this after lil nas shoes
I don’t think he knows that’s supposed to be holy water
Anyone came here after seeing the Lil Nas one
&lt;333
They collabed with jesus
As if the water comes from Jordan it your crazy tap water what happens when you tread on a nail and it looks like you&#39;ve peed yourself
Those 5.2k dislikes are people who worship satan.
🩸 represent “the blood of Jesus”
If my priest don’t have these kicks on while I’m getting married. He ain’t my priest
Who is here after Lil Nas X announced his “Satan” 97s?
I rather wear this than the lil nas x shoes
Sheeeeesh
He said it smells like a sneaker
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTYR6LXmAw&amp;t=300">5:00</a> yes it happened again, this time with partly human blood
I want these 😭
I wanna pair wow that’s unreal  I love them.  Water from the Jordan river beyond 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Waiting for someone to wear the Devil shoe on one foot and Jesus on the other.
Imagine Unbox Therapy Unboxing the Satan shoes Seeing it Has blood.
Fast forward to lil nas X 666 shoe with mschf
👍
I&#39;m not Christian so idk but isn&#39;t this supposed to be disrespectful?
Anyone here after that lil nas &quot;Satan shoes &quot;
And now we have the those Lil Nas X Satan Shoes!
These shoes are blasphemous, you’ve all been taught by the media to forget the word. When did God a sign a contract with Nike? Or are we being taught that religion in marketable and we can put it on our feet instead of in our hearts?
Came here  after the relly cool satanic shoe
Review the Satan shows
Looking forward for the unboxing of Satan Shoes version
Water proof
I needed to see these amazing shoes after seeing lil nas created
Nike water max 97 🔥💧
Its holy water asshoe hsjs
Mschf made these to mock. They made them so u could destroy it. That’s why there’s instructions. Mschf is satanic.
Bet your here after lil nas shoes
NOW HE HAS TO UNBOX THE SATAN SHOES OF THE COLLAB WITH LIL NASS
Guess the Lil Nas X satan shoe was designed to mock this one. Just like the ANTICHRIST Hence the reason for the lawsuit from nike The Devil is really a liar😏

Im going yo buy me a pair i don&#39;t care how much they want
Who here after lil nas x satan shoes?
These are better than them bullshit shoes that lil nas dropped
Would you guys step on a cross?<br>Then why would you step on holy water?<br>It&#39;s highly disrespectful. In a rush to conflict the Satan shoes. Nike made a shoe that disrespects holy water.<br>So in a way, they just produced two shoes that disrespect Jesus<br>And I&#39;m not Christian
And now they have Lil Nas X Satan shoes
I needed to see these again after lil nas x demon shoes
You’re here because of the Lil Nas X shoes
It’s not a Collab it’s a Custom 666 pairs of 97s he’s being Sued by Nike

Holy cross on the shoe and holy water under the foot. I don&#39;t know who was the &quot;GENIUS&quot; behind this idea. Bravo Nike !!! Indeed money-making should supersede all the ideologies of faith and morality.

Nike factories are/where in Indonesia China and Vietnam, also the 1st date on the label in the tongue is the manufacturing date the 2nd is the release date. Lastly I’d assume that they are modified triple white nike 97s
The price is 4K

❤️
Apparently. You can run up to 20% faster with these shoes &amp; jump 10% higher. That comes in handy for when you&#39;re running from the police and need to jump fences to get away.
While I’m not that religious those are sick
These Air Maxes got the DRIP
What  a stupid idea
I will give you 25000 dollers
Can you call that nike AIR when they are fild with WATER?

You gotta be sure it passes the minimum allowed limit of water in the airport or you will be leaving them behind. lol
Not gonna lie. They fresh tho
plot twist: its the nike ceo&#39;s piss!
Airport security : hipity hopity your shoes are now our property.

Kanye is gonna be so mad cuz Nike try to fuck with  his Jesus bag.

So this is what they meant by jesus walking on water, He just got these years before it’s time.

LMAO
yeah walking on water is cool, but imagine walking on air
When you are a sneaker head at 9<br>And a priest at 10

Watermax
Air can be compressed, water can&#39;t. So running or jumping must be terrible with those.
60 cc water from the Jordan river.... right... once that water dries it will look like eye crust...
Am a hype beast, and am a Muslim so am not allowed to wear the shoes😭
Now they should make a Jordan with jordan river water
i knew nike will do this kind of shit
no one<br><br><br>straight up just no one<br><br><br><br><br>unbox therapy : lets go for a blessed walk

The only thing you got to do is take a needle take some blue food coloring water and injected it in the shoes a much cheaper pair of shoes as a matter of fact any shoes to have see-through bottoms like that. I&#39;m pretty sure it will work..😁😁
So if I&#39;m stranded in the middle of the desert can I just cut them open and drink the water?
They will be heavy because there is water
can i please have it
Will it leak??
Are they heavy?
Eat your cereal
How many pairs of these do you think Kanye bought?
Muito foda
Holy
What a waste of water
Is no one gonna talk about the kimetsu no yaiba or demon slayer music.
Let&#39;s get one thing straight,  if that is blessed water from the river Jordan it would be blasmaphy to have it under your soul of your feet....another mockery by nike
Crazzyyy🔥🔥
its probably just tap water
Jesus be having the drip 💧✝️😳

Water is incompressible don’t know what they were going for
How can someone attach a god symbol to a Shoe? And how is it not bothering anyone? If it had been an Indian god on Shoe, people would have burned Nike Showrooms
