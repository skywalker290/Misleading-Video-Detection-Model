This movie was done so dirty but you can’t denied this trailer<br><br>Edit: I remember when I first saw this trailer it felt like a whole new thing and I thought we were about to see a darker side of the MCU like a 16+ kind of vibe, or at least that’s the vibe I got watching this trailer
Female superhero movie done right. This was real good movie. Love it.
in wanda vision. wanda take over entire town mind controls them agents will. and black widow and winter solder all about undo mind control. so make me think if bring Natasha back that she not like wanda anymore as she mind controlling everyone.   also wanda take yellana and make birth colossus how going work if there reproductive organs work?
I couldn&#39;t figure out its subject or mission. If this movie is funny, call it funny. If it&#39;s action, keep it action. The ending has no meaning. Not many people liked the movie anyway. It was Marvel&#39;s lowest rated movie. If you watch Marvel in Chronological form, you will understand it better. Let me show you in a list.....<br>Captain America: The First Avenger<br>Captain Marvel <br>Iron Man<br>The Incredible Hulk<br>Iron Man 2<br>Thor<br>avengers<br>Thor: The Dark World<br>Iron Man 3<br>Captain America: The Winter Soldier<br>Guardians of the Galaxy<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2<br>Avengers: Age of Ultron<br>Ant-Man<br>Captain America: Civil War<br>Black Panther<br>Spider-Man: Homecoming<br>Black Widow<br>Doctor Strange<br>Thor: Ragnarok<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp<br>Avengers: Infinity War<br>Avengers: Endgame<br>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings<br>Spider-Man: Far From Home<br>Eternals<br>Spider-Man: No Way Home<br>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness<br>Thor: Love and Thunder<br>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever<br>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania<br>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3<br>The Marvels....
It still gives me chills, I remember seeing it opening night and everyone was 1000% in
So underrated <br>Best movie at box office history

Nice for those bustards
They ruined Taskmaster.

The SNL version looked way better
Amazing movie! I didn&#39;t expect less actually, i was suspecting that is like that, as CA, way of look! 10 + 👏👏👏👌👌👌
🤮
my extra ordinary favourite girl  black widow
But didn&#39;t she like die in endgame when they tried to get the infinity stones
This was such a good movie. Such a pity it wasn&#39;t promoted and released in the worst way and time possible.
WAKANDA FOH-WEVVUH!!!!!
Usually I&#39;m not against feminism, but I was hoping this movie would concentrate more on Natasha&#39;s nationality rather than her gender. We Russians also want to have some representation, more accurate then typical &quot;bear-vodka-balalaika&quot; stuff.
Как называется фильм?
Awesome movie but the overall story outside of The Black Widow stuff was MEH 😑. Scarlett Johansson&#39;s and Florence Pugh performances as Natasha and Yelena are awesome and they&#39;re HOT ASFLIP 🥵🔥❤️.
Great movie 🎥

❤ My movie for Christmas
It’s just from all the movies she’s in but some of them are from black widow
Taskmaster should have stick around more in MCU it would have been fun to see it with spiderman and deadpool
It would have been better if they made and released the black widow before the first avengers movie. Along with iron man, Thor, Hulk, captain america movies. Doing the black widow movie now is more of a let down or draw back. The black widow movie should&#39;ve come out before Iron Man 2 to make more sense because black widow made her reveal in iron man 2.Avengers endgame was the climax to all the marvel movies. What do you think?
It’s not perfect but it’s certainly better than Captain Marvel. It’s more enjoyable and entertaining to watch. But, they really should’ve made this movie before Endgame.
She deserved to have a film before endgame, but it was too late.

Just getting tired of the forced back &quot;diversity&quot; in all of these movies, unless of course it&#39;s a black panther movie and then 100% black backstory is perfectly acceptable and encouraged.
Matured too early
I’ve watched this movie about 10 times since it’s release and I can’t get enough of it. Natasha is my favourite character from the MCU and I really wish she got her own franchise like the other members. Black Widow was better than the entire Thor franchise combined.
Mahlako ❤❤❤
I didn’t like the movie 🍿 . I really like the trailer though so I watch it sometimes for fun.
disappointed <br>this movie sucked

this is a 95% trailer. It has storylines I want to follow - it&#39;s a good storyline. Some parts of it - I&#39;m trying to like - it&#39;s a little hard. I do like in the end what it&#39;s about - worth some watch in a motivating way.
I enjoyed the movie until the generic humour came in. DisneyMarvel just can&#39;t do humour. It&#39;s cheesy, irritating &amp; just gets in the way of a story you&#39;re trying to believe in. You don&#39;t have to lighten tension by saturating it with breaks of humour that just don&#39;t work. It&#39;s like drawing a moustache &amp; glasses on The Incredible Hulk because he&#39;s too angry. IT DOES NOT WORK. What a fool Red Guardian turned out to be. Just like an overweight Thor in Endgame. The list of DisneyMarvel destroying characters is never ending &amp; isn&#39;t letting up.
How to make amazing trailer out of a bad movie.
So black widow, spiders still can crawl in your panties. <del>Harley Quinnzel</del>
Bro
The only one missing was the Winter Soldier.😢
Great potential,but the movie was horrible.
This movie should have been released in place of captain Marvel.
But how is she alive, when she was dead in Endgame?
I’ll never forgive you for killing Natasha
Love you black widow
Many movies impose different races, genders etc to fit in with the world at that time, but this film just did it differently p, 3 years on still a good film
Black widow will forever live on in our hearts
Create a movie of mephisto
I, sad because this could&#39;ve been much more deep and interesting. We&#39;ve touched only the surface of this character and now she&#39;s gone.
she looks gorgeous
F*** 2020.
This looks like pure shiest (if, there is such a word). <br>Puke is a word. Correction;<br>This looks like puke.
I&#39;m ah fan that&#39;s all n it&#39;s Matt lanter I love but i don&#39;t want em to know 😢
Matt lanter
Weakest avenger
Her whole family is a badass
Her superpower is bravery
😍😍
Like this one.  The storyline is great 👍. Seriously it&#39;s awesome 👌.
The Trailer is better than the whole movie
Even though I hate how they depicted Task Master. I still think this was a solid movie though Natasha deserves a better movie
wow these trailers get so many views - they are a league of their own.
wow this is like when you hear someone was wronged and when you go into it - it&#39;s the tip of the iceberg. This one seems more of a watch than the avengers, but who am I to decide - when all the movies are good.
chapek threw a doozy on this movie. I couldn&#39;t watch it with all the real life drama going on. Now that that&#39;s over - I&#39;d love to watch it. Can&#39;t believe I watched a super-relevant-to-today&#39;s-world movie like this! Holy moly this is like everyday life where everyone&#39;s always after everyone - one wrong move and someone&#39;s cancelled by the mob and it&#39;s every person out for themselves with pandemics and who knows what. Seeing someone like widow get her own movie to play out exactly how a nobody is on every top person&#39;s radar - that is where it&#39;s at! I thought iron man had it - but this is the next step in the progression of the MCU.

I stream this movie for motivation when I clean... If she can do all that, then I can vacuum 👍
Black widow is heading straight to infinity war right?
I don&#39;t understand. All of this happened after she was married to Kylo Ren??
Why was Black Widow performed by a White actress? And Black Panther by a Black actor?
Marvel I love u but u shoulda released this a long time ago 😭

The movie that ended the Golden Era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and started the decline of the Superhero Movie Genre.
am i the only one who&#39;s more bothered by yelena&#39;s adaptation rather than taskmaster&#39;s? they really made her from a badass assassin who always tries to prove herself as the best red room agent to... a sister 💀 we could&#39;ve had so much more if disney didn&#39;t water down the epic rivalry between natasha and her villains here.<br><br>and no idea where these taskamster fans came from anyway lol
Name of the music please.
Hi I have a question about marvel character ‘black widow’. Indian history has similar phrases - child widow, born widow. Are their any similarities or common base?
The only normal people here is Olga and Rachel Weisz. The rest omg aweful so aweful.
Natasha it’s compromised don’t want my life it’s in danger. Shalom Hashem
Black widow why is widow and black first becuase she killed her husband she doesn’t know but she really kill with a bj transferring hasatan in her brain and eat him. But since Tov only one nu? She beautiful survived and salvation coming.<br><br>Hasatan the nig known as Nigler with a z the beginning wants to know by any means saying with any vitals, feelings emotion and even senses stimulation and worse much much worse. Shalom Hashem
Rachel Weisz was super going through the fire in air just didn’t like she said we need to go back. Never go back. Actuality<br><br>Shalom Hashem
Don’t touch Natasha you sh!tz she told me you really made not harmless acts on her very diabolical and beast and terrestrial and animal of you all. Don’t touch her neither other women any age you sh!tz. Don’t touch Rachel Weisz she told me she was clearly not harmless. Don’t touch her or any girl women any age. Don’t touch Olga. Shalom Hashem
She deserves what she got
Marvel Studio Black Widow Natalie
I was enjoying it up until the black actor with the repulsive British accent appeared. So low budget.
я буду смотреть только тогда, когда эти  красавицы будут стоять у плиты и варить борщи, а смотреть бред нереальный уж извините не интересно. Да еще когда это женщины, вы напичкаете людей таким бредом, потом в реальности у миллион людей рассинхрон происходит между их головой и реальность.
Great movie with black widow
garbage!
Taskmaster is not a woman!!!!
awesome movie
I Hate Because You Destroy Task Master Character
If Yelena dies in Thunderbolts I&#39;ll will jump from a cliff
Natasha Alianovna Romanovova
Hello monalisa
Her theme song will always go down hard🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ela merecia a temais 2 filme
Decided to rewatch the movies in anticipation of Ant Man and the rest of the movies coming up. Watching them in timeline order. This movie takes place after Civil War. On this viewing, eh it&#39;s just not working for me. Also feels pointless since we know how her story ends. Anywho I will probably like it more once MCU Thunderbolts comes out. Since the set up of this movie is actually more of a prequel to the Thunderbolts With Yelena Black Widow, Red Guardian and The Taskmaster.
What an awesome my Natasha your beauty what an incredible movie
What brother I am scared 😨😳 she is dead in avengers but he coming I am happy and Happy 🥵❤️
o jaaa i would bite that ŠŠŠŠŠŠŠ  of NataŠa lips;))) the movie was &quot;odlično same petice!!!&quot;!;))) in all segments! the tempo was very high, with super dialogs and action...bright scenes..etc movie izzzz an quality combo of Magnum Force(C.Eastwood),Telephone(C. Bronson), Enter the Dragon(B. Lee) and hilarious humor alla Al Bundy!!! Movie not only for Marvel fans&lt;---- i watched it cca 40 times in one week!;))) all artis/actors/stunts are perfekt--if you ask me..this should be 6 hours long film(finally real art  from Hollywood after long time!!!) &amp; please just do not get politically contaminated..in next movies!;)
this was so good
Black widow 2021
Omg there like real family 🤣😄🤣
She deserves to be in Disney + next week. I love her and Yelena
Mistake is the easiest thing to do next to making enemies
I have a question:<br>Which mistakes did Black Widow before she was an avenger?
Women
People only like her because she is attractive
I&#39;m guessing this took place before Black Widow died?
another girl power movie. very stupid and boring. Another movie that is made for money only

This movie is so dumb that my dog was barking at movie for watching it.  She drops from 15 floors, hits walls and objects on the way down real hard, and then on the ground she gets up ready to fight.  They drop from what seems to be the edge of the space, and they all come down with no problem.  <b>Your movies are getting dumber by the day Marvel Studios. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 ♥♥♥♥♥.</b>
Noice
I notice that fight scenes are very short but no matter 😮😮🤔
Did anyone notice the scene when they break out David Harbour out of prison, is the same scene when he breaks out of prison in The Stranger Things Season 4… AND it’s Russian!. How about that hey aha
It is clearly a guy in the Taskmaster suit
THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED
Building a safe environment is more important, as well as instruments<br>Natural disasters are real and people do not truly understand the mineral deposits underground <br>including natural gas development that can cause explosions, there are also more potential hazards. <br>People usually wait for accidents to happen allegedly before they make changes<br>When construction sites excavate minerals under the ground they find massive rocks etc <br>that they may not even understand existed. <br>Erosion Lol

Most beautiful woman alive!
Scarlett was created by this character bravo 👌👌🔥🔥💓💓💓💓💞💞💞💞💞💘💘she is very wonderul I love her ❤💕💗❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
allah
So very underrated. I loved this movie.
Bro ive already watched this and it was amazing but now i wish they make a yelena belova movie
Y&#39;all better fix Taskmaster by Deadpool 3, this movie was amazing up until you made Taskmaster into Deadpool from Wolverine 💀 a brainwashed mute with no personality? That&#39;s what Taskmaster was? Fr?
Pheromones
Y el desnudo de Scarlett?
Sadly in my opinion the film turned out to be terrible. Shame because black widow has been pretty consistent. But this was just boring. Also I don&#39;t get the hype surrounding Florence.
&quot;At some point we all have to choose between what the world wants you to be and who you are.”
We are going to bring your sister back! Do you want to help? -______.
Oh, Scarlett. Dear, sissy! So beautiful!🥰💕🤗💕 LOVE.
They sent an Army to stop her.
I honestly don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t like this movie..... It&#39;s a really good movie imo I enjoyed it so much
Someone remind that stupid Scarlet that frowns don&#39;t mean good acting! Moron.
Yikes! I guess I need to grow up but a giant quasi-military base floating in the sky that&#39;s full of angry women, that get disarmed by little red vials of gas that are shaped like tampon applicators...and it&#39;s called the Red Room? Now that&#39;s some tongue in cheek hilarity right there!!!!
This movie could have been so much cooler if task master was the main villain, and he was idk maybe the brother of the girl that exploded or something. In the trailer black widow says “before I was an avenger I made mistakes, and a lot of enemies” would have been way cooler if we see her early years at the start of the move and establish a relationship with task master, make him hate her. The scene where he watches clips of her from Ironman 2 in the trailer could have been during the events of Ironman 2 he was looking for her to get revenge or something, and she was kinda hiding from him, and then they cut to the civil war timeline and he found her. They didn’t have to gender swap him, didn’t have to show his face, and also then it would make more sense because no one can survive that explosion. It would also show how she made mistakes, and at the end task master would still live and he could face the avengers in the future, he is a really cool villain and had a lot of potential
Mmm marvel, translate indonesia please ☺
I will waych this.
Disgusting enemy pleasant Film
Assuming this movie was after Civil war<br>It will make sense than releasing it in 2021
Masterpiece
The only disappointing thing about this movie was Taskmaster
Tony Master&#39;s TaskMaster evolved to Olga Kukuripotapenko TrashMaster
I&#39;m hoping they make yelena an avenger and call her white widow.
...This skeched artist organised with her friends terracts: Trade Center Pentagon 2011, Tsunami 2004, MS Estonia 1994, terracts in metro Moscow 2010, corona virus in 2019. They did it for stealing digital copies of royals bodies and digital copy of my body for financing their own terrorists group. Never publish these artists or you will be considered as sponsor of  terrorism.<br>...
completely forgot that she died in end game and that she had her own movie
B O R I N G
Marvel is always awesome 😎
All these years I knew it was coming
It is funny where black widow is dead in EndGame but in 2021 she is just alive
Scarlett Johansson&#39;s Black Widow deserved a better movie than this
We need more black widow movies it’s a litteral request to marvel
I love that we have dave harbour from stranger things in this he looks so young compared to how he looks on that show but still looks good either way I liked her with long red hair medium and short as well but I wasn&#39;t crazy about the blonde I probably would have liked it more if the eyebrows weren&#39;t bleached before I did like the half red/blonde a lot though so when &quot;Melina&quot; was with dreykov and when &quot;Natasha&quot; was locked up with Alexei had me so lost til &quot;fake Melina&quot; with dreykov turned out to be real Natasha and &quot;fake Natasha&quot; who was locked up with Alexei ende up being the real Melina was pretty crazy
I just watched this awesome movie and I&#39;m crying that I&#39;d never get to see scarlet j. to play as BW in the mcu
The way she holds that bottle of beer makes me detached from the character mofos.
These terorists from downing street SeaCliff who need to be sent in police to explain if they did teract MC Estonia in 94 and Tsunami in 2004 in Tailand with they mafia for stealing copy of my body and other royals to make movies for dirty money. I want them to be dead ....
who else came to see the yelena casio watch
wow, how can this horse power trash can get 67%
just watched this movie and thought it was good - nothing special but then again i always have wanted to see a show on the Red Room organization than an individual black widow, or a story(s) about the cold war with them playing there role throughout the story.
worst movie of mcu.
Y el desnudo de Scarlett Johannson?
The soundtrack is awesome... listening it again and again and again
this is one of the best movies l`ve ever watched!
It would be nice if she got like a second movie
Captain America Winter Soldier was a better Black Widow movie than the actual Black Widow movie
1 year since BW today! Will never forget Nat or the rest of the OG Avengers.. Can&#39;t wait to see what comes next for the MCU.🖤🖤
she really did it we had to let her go. and at some point we all have to choose between what the world wants you to be and Who You Are. and she done runing.
Did they make this film deliberately bad to please the bigots who think female protagonists shouldn&#39;t be the face of Marvel films?

This trailer and song choice were ten times better than the movie!!!
this girl should have taken zoes role as gomora, and zoe as black widow
Now we know what Hopper was doing all those months in Russia
Boring
I seen Stranger Things then this :D
I don&#39;t care what people say this movie was actually very fun.
one of the most boring movies i&#39;ve ever seen. 3/10.
This was one of the best movies in the entire MCU. I thought it was absolutely brilliant!!!!!! Natasha was a superstar
I watched the movie last week .. my whole intention goes to Florence.<br>I fall in love XD
Worst ever from marvel 👎👎
The background score is the best in the entire MCU
Wo that BGM ❤️❤️❤️
Jesus saves❤️✝️
You  are  a avenger.
i dont want tobe that guy but after watching the movie its completely trash
❤❤❤❤

Scarlet is good in anything that she is in, period. Stephen Dorff criticism of her makes me laugh. Yes Stephen, she’s getting paid millions, and you are not in interesting movies anymore, we get it, your jealous. 😌. It’s about time women got paid more in Hollywood by their acting skills, and not by constantly getting naked. If you don’t like it Stephen, you don’t have to watch it. 🫣
The trailer was made near the end of 2019 but was put on hold in May 2020 because of the pandemic then got realeasd over a year later in July 2021 in cinemas
That’s crazy, Does she D-D-D-DIE?
Miss natasha

Me when i see Black widow movie after endgame: “Wait, isn’t she dead?”<br><br>Me when i see Black Widow Movie post credits: “Oh, I see this is an origin movie”
I watched this for free online via torrent download.
Chất lượng, Sỹ Luân chắc thích bản Cover này lắm này! Chúc mừng em cùng toàn thể Ekip F. Studio
Is Yelena the next black widow?
Just watched the movie and seriously without it&#39;s bright lightning settings, i would&#39;ve think this is a dc movie. It&#39;s so no marvel.
Amazing trailer for Black Widow! I do feel like her movie should&#39;ve been released in phase 3. At least, she finally got a movie. So that&#39;s cool!
“You won’t win. I’ve always found it best… not to look into the past.”<br><br><br>That was some intense foreshadowing to Natasha’s Death in Endgame…
Movies are beautiful to show you the wrongs that must never  exist. i love all women to never be sad
This movie could’ve done a lot better for a origin story of black widow so many confusing pointless scenes for a origin superhero story for black widow
Quá tuyệt vời thầy ơi xem thầy từ hồi chưa có gì trong tay đến khi có vợ con và thành công như ngày hôm nay .
diễn vậy mà ngồi cười được hả chời
The only bad thing in this movie (not counting the exaggerated bad action sequences) is the fact Natasha and her mother almost like like sisters 😅<br>I&#39;m not complaining but I just can&#39;t take it seriously 😂💦👌
I Task Master. I know it.
Can&#39;t believe this came out 2 years ago...
I only finished this movie because Yelena is fine af. Y&#39;all cant disagree
Z
To be real every marvel character should have there own movie before joining up with other groups of people
American pie..Don McLain
If only the movie was anything g like this trailer 😭😒
Original
I will fight on the road
No one challenge me I am original DC
DC: Batman don&#39;t have super powers, he is detective but he have cape and mask &amp; suite like super heroes, Lets finish Justice league sequel and reboot because human can&#39;t be fit with super heroes. <br>Marvel: Black Widow is a human she fought like a super hero with all marvel super heroes and ended her journey like a super hero. Yes it is possible. Bye bye DC
Absolutely loved this film
This is an amazing trailer. It shows how fearless Black Widow is.
William Hurt [*]
This trailer was way better then the movie :(
This should  show  as the first one in movie trailer.
What is her power?
Scarlett J: I finally get my own film!<br>Marvel: Yeah, let&#39;s setup the next Marvel films
This is why there is no stranger things season 4 (if you know that series)
This movie was really FIRE! I liked every second of it
Man remember when we were all excited for this, then that COVID bullshit happened and got delayed to July 2020, then to November 2020, then to May 2021, and finally, July 2021. After all those delays, the film turned out to be well not a masterpiece but still worth it and WAY BETTER then Captain MarySue
black widow 1 star in start on save
I only enjoyed the family reunion part, everything else depended on severing the nerve which happened to be on her face lol
This movie is so awesome

she deserved a trilogy more than spiderman and antman, but y’all aint ready for that convo.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=102">1:42</a> what  weapon  is  that
Even though Black Widow Had Only One Solo Movie😂, We Can&#39;t Ignore The Fact That She Did The Most Number Of Marvel Movies
Best movie finish that movie one today :)
after Civil War before infinity war and Endgame
God i miss her
What we expected from black widow:<br>Action, spies, secret op, seriousness.<br><br>What we actually got:<br>BuDaPEshT
ONE OF THE BEST MCU MOVIES! I love Natasha and Yelena 💚🔥
i miss her so much
We need more black widow movie, <br>Story about clint and nat firstime meet maybe
Well she not the best actor
I miss you natasha 😭😭
Amazing!!!! Just now watching this today, best movie I’ve seen in a very long time!💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
You know, Drax is actually in this trailer. You just can&#39;t see him because he&#39;s standing so incredibly still, he&#39;s become invisible to the eye
Trailer more entertaining than film
&quot;Natasha don’t slouch I’m not slouching hey hey listen to your mother oh ok enough all of you ok that’s not fair I didn’t say anything” love the humor
Nobody talking about lemelo and lonzo ball aperrance
This movie seems pointless after the fact we know she dies in endgame. It would have made more sense to have it before so that people can appreciate the character even more after seeing her history. I haven’t watched it yet, but honestly I don’t think i will, the fact she is no longer going to be a part of the mcu is y I won’t
i am obsessed with this film
NATASHA DESERVED ALL
Daredevil and Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) should meet and make love.
LOVE YOU, Scarlett!🥰 Miss you.🤗💕
Who&#39;s here after no way home
I love that many people love Natasha 🤩
doug walker sent me
Background music pretty interesting &amp; This Trailer is so Good
Plot Twist: That wasn’t the real Taskmaster. It’s just someone who took up the mantle of Taskmaster. Meaning that Tony Masters is still out there.
I expected black widow movie to be as dark as a flashback  shown of red room in Age of Ultron  ....in movie they made us feel Natasha is less intelligent , she was so sidelined like what kind of tribute film was it ?... They just gave importance to Yelena very disappointed.
man the amount of delays for this movie
Yes!!
I wood love to see a what if episodes of Blade and black widow vs Morbius
Thalaiva ❤️❤️❤️
Great movie. Obviously it&#39;s gonna be a great movie, it is a Marvel movie after all. Love the story line and script. Ratings 7/10
I watched this when I first came out, it&#39;s the first Marvel movie I ever watched. Looking back, definitely didn&#39;t understand or remember half of it but I&#39;ve decided a few days ago to watch all of the movies in the MCU. o7
Adopted lol
In theaters or order it on Disney+ with Premier Access July 9.
BGM was  🔥
Happy Birthday to Black Widow
Such a bullshit movie
Trailer is very nice, intersting thing is the Background music
It&#39;s not fair how scarlet Johansson got played on this movie .This movie was a good movie that did poorly in the box office because of Disney plus
One of the wrost villain is taskmaster (people who just see movies not comics)
The movie was good.
Woooooooooow
At least Black Widow has a family not like Wanda 😢
Only female avenger i liked
First up I&#39;m speechless second I love the last one ahahahahha
this movie is about pimp&#39;n
I know the real reason we were waiting so long. You see Black Widow doesn&#39;t wear a mask. Scarlett Johansson would need to do all her stunts, or you&#39;d need a very good computer program to edit her in, and if you&#39;ve looked at her Wikipedia page, you can tell she&#39;s been very busy. Now look at Iron Man and his mask. Any stuntman can do that job and then Robert Downey Jr doesn&#39;t need to do his stunts and can just record all those lines. Chris Hemsworth is not nearly as busy as Scarlett so the fact that they need him for every scene isn&#39;t a problem.
Hi
Terrible story line, acting was ok... I don&#39;t get what the hoopla was about... LOL
I&#39;m ! Not I love.
Only thing i liked about this movie was the intro and the song they played
Just watched great movie 👍
The movie is disappointing af the first half of the movie make me want to sleep, I waited the for year and this is why we got
I love how the description isn’t updated and still says May 1.
Cant believe her contract expired. I dont want her to leave...
Movie wasn&#39;t good in my opinion. It seems like it was just meant to be something to uplift women. Don&#39;t get me wrong they did great... but the Movie as a whole wasn&#39;t  really worth watching . Just a bit boring fr
Here from Possum Reviews.
The dad dies right?
Marvel stios
florence pugh ggggoooooodddd
The fact that i watched the movie first and avoid the trailer for no spoilers
If only my husband knew how this ended. The power went out right before. I know how it ends. 🤩😉🦋🌈✨💞 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=559">9:19</a>
watched it. pretty misandrist movie. 👎

L movie
I’m here because of the ad

Wait rebond lie, lamelo esn’t there
She deserves her own Disney+ TV series tbh<br><br>The movie packed too much in too little time, there were too many aspects that should’ve been explored in depth via a TV series
POV: you came here from recent comments because whose people can say this movie is worst than captain marvel 🤡
i can’t believe this was delayed by a whole fuckin year😂
SEE DRACULA UNTOLD ENDING SCENE, MENA NAME OF GIRL, AND SAME OLDER MAN IN BLACK WIDOW MOVIE WITH SWAT TEAM
HER STORY OR HIS STORY?
DADS A CONSTRUCTION WORKER AND MOM WORKS IN COMIC BOOK SHOP, FAMILY IN DANGER FROM SHERIFFS, CONTACT ROMANIAN EMBASSY TO SAVE THEM! THE WRATH OF MOM WILL STRIKE THE SHERIFFS! (LYNCHBURG, VIRGINIA)
This movie was disappointing for me.
MCU has been messing up characters and stories for quite a bit now..stopped watching after Tony Starks and Bruce Banner were credited to creating Ultron..everybody knows Hank Pym created Ultron..Taskmaster is no different here..was very intrigued to see what they would do with Anthony Masters in this movie just to find out MCU botched yet another character just to accommodate for a plot twist
The woke brigade really pushing this crap movie.
Look Anne. It&#39;s your big Collosal
&quot;Thank you for your cooperation&quot;
Honestly just by the title of movie I had high hope but after 15-20min it just gets boring.
THE WRATH OF MOM WILL PROTECT HER DAUGHTERS FROM THE SHERIFFS!
What a awful film with dodgy accents. Borefest no wonder Disney spared the cinemas.
It&#39;s kinda sad that the trailer is cooler than the movie.
This movie was okay, but This trailer was AWESOME!!
One of the stupidest movies ever created by Marvel. Thumbs down hands down 👎
The action was top notch, but I expected more for the 133 min runtime. The pacing was slow in some parts, and had many long and dragged out scenes. There was just too much filler and not enough substance in the story. It also had lame attempt at humor. <br><br>But the real surprise here is Yelena. Florence Pugh acting was enjoyable and she&#39;s look hotter than Scarlett.
kinda weak
Who agrees with me that black widow is a legend and always will be
it is the most worst movie of mcu . total waste of time . so bad
Finally got to watching this and it is the only MCU movie I have not even bothered to finish. I can&#39;t even say what was missing from it. Maybe I just didn&#39;t give it much of a chance.
Seriously though.<br> I think this movie should have come before infinity war...
👎👎👎👎👎👎
Who wrote this movie Colin Jost? It sucked
I lost count how many failed comic parts or weak humor attempts.
Im glad i waited for it to be free. This was just okay. Beginning with intro of the Nirvana cover song was okay but was flat for 2 hours.
Guys I wanted to ask what substance did the doctor with syringe stab yelena with? Like if I remember correctly, they didn’t explain it in the movie? Or is it nothing life threatening at all?
One of the stupid movie ever .. no quality in the movie scenes .. they made this movie only for for a namesake 🤮🤮🤮
Nice Black wildow
💖💖💖
Load of American wokey yuk ... thang god  for Asian cinema and European movies ...
I know everyone is looking for the next Bitcoin but that’s like looking for the next Wheel or the next internal combustion engine.<br><br>You can sit there on your porch and wait while we’re all buzzing by in our motor cars but even if you live to be a hundred you might not see another one...
Yay I Saturday go to movie theater and watch this🤩🤩 can’t wait👍
I wish they had focus more on the red room and what happend there :(
Just Epic.....
The CIA propagandists tell Goebbels - hold my beer.))
USA propaganda.)))<br><br>And I was told that there is no US propaganda.) Propaganda in all its glory.)
Wasn’t worth the wait lol
Wow my English Teacher has taste. I&#39;m supposed make an essay about this clip.
Today i watch this movie so so so nice film i can&#39;t believe
One of the most boring Marvel movie.  Typical orphan turned badass story line.  Pretty much Black Widow and Hawkeye are useless Avengers.  I don&#39;t care how skilled you are in martial arts.  One punch from Thor, and it&#39;s over.
Florence PUGH wow she&#39;s cute
Justice for Johansson. Disney did her dirty.
The Avengers bgm at the ending of the film gave me chills 🔥🔥🔥
my anxiety for me to watch this movie only increases😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻.
this looks like they took all the cool shots of a movie and intentionally made the most vapid and generic trailer possible. I guess it&#39;s better than some spoiler trailers, but the main thing this trailer tells me is that it&#39;s a movie in which the story is completely irrelevant.
Wow this movie was really well done. I actually shed a tear or two. Easily one of the best Marvel movies of all time. I really can&#39;t remember being this impressed with the cast, the screenplay, the dialogue, the action, everything about it was perfecto.
Why is this rated T
Redbox hopped until I found it, new release, not every box has it, as in, they haven&#39;t even put them in the box at all
Idk why they didn’t use this score in the movie it’s awesome
Sometimes we have to choose between what the world wants you to be and who you are <br>I made my choice… I am done running <br>- Black widow <br>2021
Natasha waited WAYYY too long to her her own solo film<br>I have now watched the movie and it’s fire 🔥 <br>She deserved this !!!
I like the bad guy
Emperors new clothes......has to be said.....this movie is absolutely garbage under any definition of garbage.
Overacting, thin story line we&#39;ve heard a hundred times before and smothered in over done special effects. I&#39;ve always been a big fan of Marvel but lately it&#39;s like watching the Transformers sequels, they just all run together and become mindless noise.
He die end game
I can say that the potential was there, but they failed to execute it. taskmaster could&#39;ve been in other movies. what a waste of a villain
i don’t like it. don’t like the sound track, don’t like the picture… looks like a Netflix thing
Outstanding movie ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Super movie
Blackwidow n matrix = 1 universe
I haven&#39;t watched this yet cause a friend of mine slightly spoiled it about task master and there is no excitement left now. All I wanted was taskmaster to be as it is just like in comicbooks, shows. I think they ruined the character.
Man did this movie ever suck
This actor has the same actitude as amber hard, stop worshiping toxic behaviors you morons.
Even loki got a series. Hawkeye will soon commit suicide. You have the power to stop it marvel!
This movie is amazingggggg!
man idk but i seem to like every marvel movie there just too awesome
This is far better than the entire spiderman series!
A moment of silence, for the comic book version of Taskmaster. <br><br>May he rest in peace 🙏
“There&#39;s blood on the crown, go and take it<br>You get one shot to make it out alive”
Spoilers Alert:<br>Clint will be relieved when she will confront... and ig Yelena will either be the next Black Widow or some sorta villain (〒﹏〒)
can u give me this full movie download link in telegram
Marvel just want to get rid of old character that aren’t interested man! The movie sucks!
Marvel please send one superhero in Afghanistan
Done watching it
Black Widow was literally the most disappointing superhero movie I ever watched. Mainly because I had so much expectations. Taskmaster is my favorite MCU villain but they ruined it.
the movie probably wasn&#39;t good enough, but Marvel sure as hell knows how to make great trailers
place your bets,<br>vin diesel vs red guardian
I watched the movie 🍿 , it was an amazing experience. The ending made me cry 😭
I still do not understand why people hated this movie?? I honestly loved every single scene of it! The action, the story and their acting was superb
After I watch the movie...Natasha was help to Alexie on the prison to escape scence is my favourite scence
Soooooperb 🔥
But black window is white
Actually she is the wife of captain japan
Storyline, projection and action sequence  could be better. Director have forgotten that she is a human in few action sequence. Didn&#39;t meet my expectations 😕.  She deserves better than this.
Very bad movie 👎<br>Boring<br>Stop Gender swapping<br>You destroyed taskmaster &amp; ghostmaster characters
Oh Jim hopper in Russia now 😂😂😂😂 as red guardian😂😂😂😂😂
Everything fine, except &quot;widow&quot; part
I feel this movie was one of the best MCU solo movie.. really gave winter soldier vibes.. less comic, serious and action is on point and ofc simple and different story.
Hooper 🔥
what a movie it is i just love it . best characters combination and one of my favorite actors talented and beautiful full of confidence .  this movie made me smile after a long time i smile on any movie  i think this movie should have second part or maybe like a franchise .<br><br>The story have so much potential but they escaped story a little fast . I think as a first part they have to built a story detail which i would love to see but it cant happen.<br>best of luck and overall i enjoyed it
Is Rachel Weisz a vampire?<br>Doesn&#39;t look 53 years old.
The trailer is so badass but the movie was a comedy lmao
Black window is good
What a trailer Marvel ar u best
I watched this movie it was good asffff
I watched the movie today and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.
Stunt scenes are outstanding, but story wise very boring, I am switch off tv, half of the film 👎👎👎
Florence (yelena)  is marvelous! She deserves more movies!
Boooring movie..🤦‍♂️
I love you natasha
A movie with a bad Russian accent catered for feminist lol.. that’s all it is.. brainwashing feminism never stops ironically it’s about anti brainwashing
Good movie
NiceFast and Furious F9 The Fast Saga (2021)
Op
came here coz of jimin
SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!<br><br>I would give this movie half a star if i could. When I watch movies I shouldn’t be left questioning things.<br><br>I want to start with how they skipped 20 years of her life. This is a black widow movie suppose to be explaining how she became how she is and it did not.<br><br>It did not show her training, didn’t show how they got their name i’m sure i’m missing a whole bunch of other stuff but that’s what i’m thinking of rn.<br>I also did want to see her getting abandoned by her mother and the tests they did to show that she was “special”<br><br>Second.<br>The father went to jail and although it explained how, I did want to see it.<br><br>Third.<br>Though this is a movie about black widow if you’re going to introduce new characters explain their story. The sister came into the picture and didn’t really have a background story. <br><br>Fourth.<br>Why is this Red stuff created? What was the point? The could’ve associated the boss with marvel, someway somehow idk.<br>Also what does that triangle sign thing mean? <br><br>Fifth.<br>There was a lot of joking around and not taking things serious. I feel there wasn’t enough action and more so talking. The father was acting like a comedian during the war.<br><br>Sixth.<br>I’m noticing some reviews saying they CRIED watching this movie. I almost cried but these tears were tears of sadness, 2 hours of my life wasted. <br><br>The end scene...was ridiculous.<br><br>They’d be crazy to start a whole series for Hawkeye. Since the sister Yelena saw Natasha died she would’ve asked. And she probably asked Iron man or Captain America how she died, they would’ve explained every detail to her. So explain to me why she’d all of a sudden blame Hawkeye. The people that explained her death should’ve explained how Hawkeye was trying to be the soul to die instead of Natasha...I mean on end game when they came back from the past Hawkeye was there crying or whatever explaining how it was suppose to be him to die? So why would the blame go on him? <br><br>Seventh or whatever I lost track of my complaints.<br><br>This timeline was terrible. I was honestly confused as to why the Avengers were separated. Now I might’ve missed something but they didn’t explain the argument the Avengers had...I wanted to know. <br><br>I was so disappointed in this movie. I had a countdown of days to watch it, we waited some Years to watch this. I don’t even understand why they took so long to come out with this movie because unless their bringing black widow back to life the entire movie is irrelevant to what happens to the Avengers in the future.<br><br>I also want to add how this is possibly the last movie she’ll be associated with Avengers AND the only one she’s in that’s titled after herself...I am a Black Widow fan so my standards were high especially since this is an Avengers movie. This was definitely a fall compared to all the other movies. Might even be the worst one. 🤷‍♀️<br><br>I’m disappointed but Scarlett did a great job with her acting and so did her sister. (I forgot the actors name)
I have seen this movie in hindi
Nat has a whole Family? I am so behind. It is finally on Hotstar India !
uuu gempouk siut
just finished the movie i know it&#39;s late but i can&#39;t handle to not cry over the instant family Alexei,melina,natasha,yelena and natasha death
Tomorrow this movie is release in Disney plus Hotstar
My fav movie
Netherlands appproved for mercy killing. So i want one immediately. Earth will remain same. Mom dad sis love u. I have solved the problem for u.
This should have been out before the Endgame. Her death would have more impact.
Call of Duty GHOST is back 🔙🔙
best movie i ever saw but please make black widow alive
The best movie in the world
Finna watch
What will you call hero alom wife after his death? To make it simpler what will  you call Obama&#39;s wife after his death?
Scarlett Johansson&#39;s acting is so unimpressive that it&#39;s almost unbelievable
How can you be alive, hey did you saw my daughter there, can she&#39;ll also return. 😕🥺
Hi... Please say me melody in this video.
🥰😍😍🤩🤩🤩
This movie was AMAZING, I saw it the first day it came to theaters. But I&#39;m kinda disappointed that we didn&#39;t get to see them as a kid in the Red Room. I will still give it a five stars!
My question was &#39;the ending&#39;. It is really confusing.
The song in this trailer made me so hyped (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=120">2:00</a> for example) but then it wasn&#39;t part of the movie. Made me sad, but still loved the movie.
So,<br><br>You&#39;ve watched Black Widow and you&#39;re rewatching the trailers.
Marvel is the best ever single movie they upload I would watch a thousand times I would never get bored there movies are like that so interesting
I watched it 🥺
yup yes cool
the trailer is good and the film is BAD
They had been movies that were actually good or at least not bad. This is just brain-dead trash, though. I can feel brain cells dying just watching the trailer.
worst movie......1st tym marvel movie is not interesting
Goosebumps trailer watched for thousands time because of music and scene
I just saw the movie for the 6th time in a row and so many scenes in this trailer are not in the movie. Sentences had been changed
Is there bucky barnes scene?
Fury &quot;didn&#39;t&quot; see red room in the sky even if he is captain. You most be kidding me.
Such a mediocre movie<br>...with a clearly £Emin∆zi propaganda 🤢🤮
WTF, They made Scarlet Johansen look like Flo from the Progressive commercials !
I saw Black Widow yesterday and Everything about this movie is Great!! Solid 10/10
Please iron man 4
I LOVE U SCARLETT JOHANSSON ❤️🇧🇷❤️🇧🇷
Not impressed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
This movie has kgf music track
I feel like clint should have died i feel like she needed at least another film just about her to explain everything its like theyve just ended her here aswell as tony them two were my favourite avengers R.I.P😔
They should have added the discarded post credit scene. Or would have shown Wanda paying respects to her instead of Val joking and lying about hawkeye. Wanda paying respects must be emotional.
i watched every single Marvel movie and show so far... and this one SUUUUCKS TT
Garbage
Wait,Can this be explained please? Natasha has already died, I mean in movie, at endgame in sacrifice of soul stone and now Black widow&#39;s this movie coming out AFTER it, after her death...Marvel what is going on here?
THEY SHOULD GET SCARLETT THE REST OF THE MONEY THE OWE HER
:)
Me and my brother saw this movie in theaters it was amazing thank you
The best Marvel movie ever??? Not a chance, but I&#39;d definitely put it middle of the pack. Better than Captain Marvel?, debatable, BW has a better story line, CM has better syfy action, but you can&#39;t fault Captain Marvel for entering the scene so late. I&#39;d definitely watch it over some Captain America and Thor movies.
my friend wants to go watch this with me and i havent watched any marvel films before so could i go with her and just watch it or do i need backgroud films for info first? SOMEONE HELP I AM SO CONFUSED. it look so good tho x
The movie Natasha deserved
Bruh I was gonna watch this with my school on a school trip as a kinda end-of-year treat but because of COVID we couldn’t 😢
There is some delete screen, you don&#39;t see in the movie but you see it here
Why is the slouching scene too accurate to conversations I have with my mom when I slouch
i would have liked this movie so much more if it didnt come out after she died
I need the name of instrumental PLEASE
Who’s watching this after they finally watched the movie?
Taskmaster is a girl, like with everything these days.
THAY MUST THEN HAVE A CHOICE IN THE ROOM..HELP US BLACKWIDOW..
This was sucks. Very slow. I got bored and slept a little while watching it. It much better if they made this as a series. The plot is really boring!!
Taskmaster, The Skill Copycat
Came back here after seeing this,I can say that this should have came out before Captain Marvel and It is a cool and scary movie (if under 18 years old.).
Black window ka link hai kya
One of the best Marvel Movies
The movie was FANTASTIC on the big screen!
Yessss this movies was the SHIZZZZ!!!! It was sooo good like all the action and adventure was there also stay for the post credits!!!!
I <b>CAN&#39;T BELIEVE</b> someone pitched &quot;but she can&#39;t attack him because of his smell, right, and so then she breaks her own nose so she can&#39;t smell him and she can kill him&quot; and not one person in the writers room said dude, that&#39;s dumb, we can&#39;t go with that. I had such high expectations for this movie and it really let me down. She ought to sue them for how badly it turned out.
I watched this movie and I laughed, smiled, and cried. One hell of an emotional roller coaster! But I’d do it all over again if I got the chance. To anyone who hasn’t seen it, GO! It WILL be worth it
ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE OF 2021
Lesbian 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️!!
In the movie plot of the actual movie she intended to kill task master as a kid
o primeiro caso de processo depois de morta
When taskmaster took off that helmet... Reminds me of the poor, poor attempts at cosplay kids do, or even those shitty costumes they sell online or even super markets, it&#39;s so dumb and stupid to see a man, a massive body builder wear that huge suit, just to see a shrunkened body inside a massive suit, it&#39;s like watching a kid wear his dad&#39;s clothes
They really should have followed the trailer&#39;s words and actually had Taskmaster CONTROL the Red-Room. I&#39;m perfectly fine with who they wanted Taskmaster to be, but they should have just kept them as the actual main villain
If you remember a few years ago, Robert Downey Jr. was not interested in reprising his role as Iron Man until the (I will not name any names) gave a huge amount of money.  Now for Scarlett Johansson, I don&#39;t like it how people renege on a deal because they can. (And personally if it was as a man, the company would pay him without any hassle.)
i love yelenaaaa she&#39;s freaking coolll!!😭❤️❤️❤️
Gosh.  A superhero movie.  No-one&#39;s ever made one before.
RACHEL WEISZ is supposed to play SCARLETT JOHANSONS MOM?? Wtf Hollywood really has a problem with the fact that women can be and look old, this is ridiculous
Captain Marvel: If you don‘t like my movie you are a bad sexist<br><br>Black Widow: Actually a good movie
Looks cool, but not $30 cool
I’m going to see this at the cinema on Thursday
&quot;Dreykov kills you, one of the big ones come to avenge you&quot; 😂😂😂.. That shvt killed me
Poser 🤣
😁😁😁😁😁
Where is this backgroud music in the movie 😓😓. That was the biggest issue for me 😏😏😥
Another movie from the Disney monopoly😒
Everytime i see her i search redhead pawg on pornhub 😮🤷‍♂️
No, not in this lifetime, thank you....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have just watched it and now i am gonna <br>What the frick yar it got my brain nerves got down. It should have been a series
A stupid and boring trailer doesn&#39;t make you want to see more.  Made for 16 year olds  by immature &quot;adults&quot;. How much more violence do we need??
Ewwwwwww. Big ol hips and no body muscle. No super here. Haha
The score for this film was glorious.
I love how this used to be the final trailer
Oh lalaa~<br><br><br>Btw, WTH DID THEY DO TO TASKMASTER???!!!!
One more shittest move from marval.
This movie still doesn&#39;t explain what Clint was referring to when he said to Natasha &quot;You and I remember Budapest very differently&quot;.
Trailer is literally better than the movie
All what I remember from this movie is the change in the actor&#39;s face to red  as he says &quot;my dad he goes toilet on my hands&quot; Which means  he knows that what he says is perverted and disgusting, But he said it anyway, thank you Hollywood for your contribution to spoiling the mind of the next generation .
Terrible movie
My homie tested all of these websites thinking that they are not scams, however only legit one is Gamecrook. I hope I saved your time.
Imo this movie was pretty good, i thought it would be even better than what it was now but other than good job
My dream is literally to be on one of these movies 😂 I&#39;m still very young but my dream is to act 😃💀
My homie tested all of these sites believing they are real, but the only real one is Gamecrook. I hope I saved your time.
Just watched it in the cinema and fr need a sequel please!!
When I saw the movie my mined was blone
Worst od the worst Marvel ever
Its a bit of a popcorn flick, but it was fun. Personally, I would have liked to have seen BW earlier in her career, most of the events of the movie seem to happen shortly before Infinity War, so there&#39;s not much &#39;origin&#39; to it. Can&#39;t fault it too much though, enjoyable overall with some good action scenes and cool characters. Yelena was terrific.
POV: your freind is about to force you to watch it
The worst movie of the year.  Don&#39;t waste your time nor your money if you don&#39;t get it off line.  My gosh. The script totally sucked and the acting of these so called Russians. Geez. Just the worst. About 45 minutes of pure nonsense dialogue. Have no other words to describe it.
Prosto z Kina ;) Początek Nirvana - Smells Like   Teen Spirit ;) Fajnie się zazębia z Red Saprrow, Anna, Atomic Blonde ;)
MARVEL ~ Scarelt (is a hue of the color red) Johansson&#39;s hair should never be anything but red ever again. Nix the short blonde bob stuff.. it&#39;s not good on any female and certainaly not on Scarlet.
I hope this theme is used for hawker trailers
This movie was not that good. Why is Scarlett Johannson so wooden?
ENd of movie , lots of suspence. When a lady tells natasha,&#39;s sister that hawki killed natasha..
We miss black widow
Watching this trailer after I have watched the movie and I noticed some scenes were removed 😳
I love the relationship of sisters between Jelena and Natasha, very well built without pains and glories, that is to say the hard truth and what we have come to.  I also congratulate the trilogy with Raquel all divas and icons of cinema. Without a doubt a trio that I would love to continue seeing as Black Widows Girls and in the near future in Science Fiction films in space., It may be a trilogy of warriors from the stars or the worlds or interstellar travel to save the planet.  I am enchanted and in love with Florence my icon of woman. Congratulations Natasha un film very fine construyed. Intelligent for always.
White Widow
I wanted to see Tony Jaa as the Taskmaster😎😎😎
Black Widow is such a lit movie. I need the trilogy with Natasha and Yelena &quot;family&quot; as well
Here&#39;s the recap: <br>Black widow 1: Red room story<br>Black widow 2: Budapest, natasha join the avengers<br>Black widow 3: Bring down the red room<br>Ah, my favorite trilogy, thanks marvel
One of the best Marvel movies in my opinion<br>I LOVE IT SO MUCH
Came back to this trailer to say IT’S TRASH!!! Scarlet is played out. This Hollywood agenda of trying to portray her as some badass character is a failed mission.
Only Americans can come up with such cruel movie.<br>The fact that kids speak Russian in the movie says it all about Hollywood&#39;s hate towards the Russians.
This music is lit though
Is it just me or were there some scenes shown in the trailer that weren’t used in the movie? Such a waste!
Gender bending Taskmaster was so unnecessary.
The music is We Are Gods by Audiomachine
One of the best MCU trailers ever, very dissatisfied with the movie, i’m tired of the trope to only gender bend a villain to female if it’s a female hero, it’s basically saying women can’t beat men unless they have a team (which i mean irl is mostly true but it’s based on comics that are supposed to inspire and give hope to everyone) so wtf
Alexei&#39;s story about his dad and him fishing had me laughing!
More Crap.  One can never underestimate the intelligence of the public
Don&#39;t be sad, Scarlett. You played a supporting character in a bad movie.
I see the movie right know and i was here
Florence is the combination of Chloë Grace Moretz and Maisie Williams 😊
Unpopular Opinion: Florence should&#39;ve been the Captain Marvel, no doubt it would have been a Sick Cast 🔥
Who’s here after watching the movie?
natasha is dead then how is this movie releesing?
Red Guardian movie please 🤞🤞🤞🤞

Love the music so much !! whoever is wondering what the name is —&gt; Audiomachine - We Are Gods
We need our Natasha. Bring her back...
After watching this i can say that captain marvel was trash this is a masterpiece. Its my number 2 or 3 in marvel
The trailer was better than the movie itself
I watched this movie. It&#39;s a flip flop.
Sigh. Looks like Disney&#39;s Done It Again and I wish they wouldn&#39;t anymore😔
As I am getting older, this kind of movies no longer impress me. they are too childish and native ..........
I don&#39;t own a TV and I haven&#39;t watched a movie in years, I may watch this.
They ruined taskmaster&#39;s character 😭
If they changed Task Masters whole origin and his suit AND not have wasted Red Guardian then this movie would have been the top 10 best movies in Marvel
GET WOKE GO BROKE AT ITS FINEST 🤣
when everyone wants Black Widow Movie bac when she was alive then MCU dropping it after End Game when she was gone. my words are nonsense. I just want nat to be back alive 😭
Is it only me or the logo of the black widow movie is like/looks like the red marking/s of a black widow spider?
After seeing this, I have to say that one movie is NOT enough for Natasha Romanoff story, it should be trilogy, it will as good as captain america trilogy, maybe even more
For me this movie is like the third movie of black widow trilogy
For me black widow is like a trilogy, and I&#39;m watching the third movie
Bgm is we are gods
First 20 minutes great. Rest a romantic comedy.
Black Widow has one of the darkest and most interesting origin stories in marvel comics, why just why didn’t you guys made a movie about that instead of this unnecessary garbage? It added NOTHING to her character, and her co star literally stole the show. Such a wasted potential.
Am I the only one who watches trailers only after watching the movie
Marvel movies without extraordinary super power characters makes it look like a bang average action movie. I thought the storyline was average, the villain was average and etc. Average movie.
I&#39;m on YouTube looking for &quot;black widow trailer&quot; only to say that you don&#39;t have to pay extra for content that is hardly worth it. Black Widow, it&#39;s like any movie and it&#39;s a shame because I had expectations. Better watch it on Internet pages that put that movie for free and without viruses.
Finally 💯💯
seeing it today in imax looks so sick
Why no one&#39;s talking about David Harbour? 😂
salute to trailer maker 😁
July 18, 2021.  I was going to go see this but not after all the reviews on this thread.  Thanks for the heads up.
This trailer ws alot better then the actual movie!!:(:(
This movie belongs in the 🗑 . Stop making these turds 💩.
What a disappointed movie
Is this movie even comming out it took like 3 to 4 delays
I saw this movie in IMAX but the bass was nonexistent and I&#39;m just wondering if that&#39;s how the movie is or if it could have been the theater I went to. Who else saw it in IMAX and had the full experience?

What a stupid movie<br>Stopped it after 10min
After watching this movie, I feel like the directors, producers, and writers of the other marvel films weren&#39;t consulted. I love Black Widow, but this seemed like 5 tv series paste together. Still better that Captain Marvel though. I would encourage everyone to go watch it though, my opinion is subjective right?
This movie was so bad. They could have had a great story but it was sooooo bad. Like how do you mess this up?
Badass woman ever!
What&#39;s the song?
Just seen it.The worst movie in the MCU so far! Felt like a fast and furious movie.
natasha the epitome of mysterious someone 😌
I didn’t know it was made long ago I only watched it like a week ago
Going to see this movie today!!!
It’s disappointing how badass Taskmaster was in the trailer compared to the actual film
Clueless Disney had to ruin Taskmaster because Widow couldn’t beat the comic version lol
Now is the time for the Batman to lead the power of Earth&#39;s heroes. &quot;CS MARVEL&quot;
(0 spolier dans ce com) Ce film est juste incroyable, il y a de l action toute les 3min, les effets spéciaux sont toujours aussi incroyable bref les scènes d action  sont des pépites !! Ma seul et petite déception est taskmaster, car moi je lit beaucoup les comics et j adore ce personnage, j&#39;espère qu&#39;on reverra le personnage mais que une autre personne endossera le rôle !!  Et on retrouve un personnage très charismatique...Yelena Belova                En 1 mot : spectaculaire. Bravo Marvel
God. A lot of shots, scenes, and lines in this trailer are not in the film at all.
Bdw the red room is in sky and mask guy is a 👧
Black widow should have came before endgame  its not fair
This move is between civil war and infinity war😘
SUCH A GOOD MOVIE OMG
Definitely best than best movie of Marvel ❤️❤️
Good to see there is another BTEC Captain America out there in the MCU
10k people: My plan is to dislike this video<br>Me: Well your plan sucks
Exquisite 5/5 ✅
Marvel where !is IRON MAN  😭
This is the BEST Marvel movie, hands down. I haven’t loved a movie so much until this … It’s been a week since I’ve seen it and I’m still shook.
this was the first movie where the beginning credits gave me chills, didn&#39;t even realize I was watching credits
I&#39;ve got goosebumbs three minutes straight with the Smells Like Teen Spirit scene
Well, this movie sucks

I&#39;m so sad that I couldn&#39;t watch this in theaters with my friends. <br>I&#39;m also so sad that she&#39;s canonically dead.<br>Otherwise, it was a legendary movie.
Just watched this movie in the cinema and I can confidently say that this movie is AMAZING!
Feminist propaganda..
When the trailer’s better than the film…
Was that Love Sausage in red?
I have been waiting wait for this for 10 years!
SPOILER ALERT!<br><br><br><br><br>After watching the movie it feels like an exact replica of Captain America : The Winter Soldier.<br>The Unbreakable organisation , The Brainwashed Comrade , Brotherly love(Sisterly,in this case) , falling Heli carriers , and much more<br><br>Oh and the cool Bucky Knife flip thing and The Shield ,<br>And Of course the awesome Fight sequences.<br>And I made sure that I put the Warnings before the instructions.<br>                                                                        !!!!WONG!!!!
C’MON they should have made her a movie way way way beforeeeee. I just finished it, its a roller coaster of emotions [I mostly cried because c’mon we all know Nat died in endgame, one the reasons why I can’t watch it. She’s my favorite and the reason why I watched avengers at the first place.]  And the cast? GIRL PERFECTION ✨ I just want more movies with Scarjo as Black Widow. I miss her so much 🥺😭.
.
Bullshit female superhero&#39;s for gods sake stop supporting this crap

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=57">0:57</a> may 1, 2020 lol
I just got done finished watching it and I’m kinda disappointed on how they treated taskmaster
&quot;Welcome to Movie phone&quot; ;)
Me&quot;so what&#39;s your super powers&quot; black widow&quot;kicking&quot; me&quot;oh right cuz no one on planet earth 🌍 can kick<br>...rise your hand if you can kick.....hulk stop being nice&quot; hulk&quot;sorry&quot;
I love how she poses after every different move shows how well trained she is.
Ahora que vi la película y estoy viendo el tráiler, me doy cuenta que tiene mucho spoiler 0_0
coming back and rewatching this is shocking like they really showed the entire movie in a trailer
Black widow play by a white woman !? 😅😅😅
after seeing it , it definitely should’ve come out after civil war and before infinity war
&#39;&#39;His call signs Task Master, he controls the Red Room&#39;&#39; ???? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=36">0:36</a>
This movie was an absolute banger 🔥🔥
I watched this movie yesterday. If you haven’t watched it to watch it right now. Something always happens it’s so good. Amazing
If this film came before endgame it should have hinted her death so it was released at time it must have
I love Florence and I&#39;m glad that she is getting recognition
Sorry to say but as marvel and dc fan i  only liked 3 things about this movie<br>Yalena,red guardian,post credit scene<br>But still way better than captain marvel
I remember back when I said taskmaster was a woman when this trailer dropped and people called me a mad man
...:D masterpiece of drama and boredom.
Who is here after watching the movie 🍿 <br>👇
What&#39;s nice is the movie shied away from the feminist pandering. No scenes like Captain Marvel flashing back to all the men (only men, how sexist) who kept her down...and no unmotivated line-up of females like in Endgame. This one told a consistent story and didn&#39;t try to break out of the reality of the movie to score political points with the politically correct crowd.
İ miss nat
ITS FINALLY HERE! I loved Black Widow. Marvel is coming back! 🥳
🕷️
Boo jac Sheifer booo....boo.. bad writer and a hack...booo jac sheifer booo
Came back here cause the wait is finally over!
&quot;In theatres may 1&quot; me seeing it in theatres in july 7 for the opening night.
Who is holding AMC stock and loves to go to the movie theatre?
Just saw this, we loved it.
When The Black Widow died in Endgame, there was hardly any mention of it and no service for her and I thought that in the post credit scene for The Black Widow, it was overlooked again in that Julie Dreyfus was blowing her nose at the headstone. I know it isn&#39;t a true strory and Natasha Romanov isn&#39;t a real person, but it just bugged me.
I just watched this movie , it&#39;s just freaking awesome 😎 100000/10 , hopefully we see a movie for her sister or something .
Waste time.Very boring and stupid. Only for dump people.
I have just seen this film and I highly recommend it. Best move ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
i miss this soundtrack....<br>also this movie should have come out just after civil war.....
Now we&#39;ll see Task master&#39;s full power
What is the name of the music.?
I love the Movie but its emotion it makes me sad by watching the movie that Black widow is not alive anymore 🥺🥺😭
Avarage Movie 🎥 Very Laggy 😴
whos here after the movie
SUCH A POSER
What a bullshit
I like how this trailer made it look like Taskmaster was the main villain when she was only a side villain. Well done Marvel, bravo.
It&#39;s really odd that taskmaster is a girl but has a man body
Back here after watching the movie, which was AWESOME and action-packed! Fun spotting the differences between the trailer and movie
Love this movie!!!
A fun film. But the villains were dogshit
lame
This movie was dryyyyyyyy
Black Widow is the WORST movie ever made 🍿
I&#39;m here after watching the movie and I believe it should came out a bit earlier
i literally saw this movie today, and going to see it again tomorrow😆
Yeah, that was a fun movie. 😊👍
Who is here after watching the movie
I finally saw it and it was awesome. The post credit scene should have been the post credit scene of Endgame
We enjoyed
Great film tbh
Thor: I will have 4 solo movies <br>Tony and Steve: we only had 3<br>Nat and Bruce: we only have 1<br>Clint: you guys are getting movies
Ah and if you&#39;re watching Captain Falcon and the Winter Soldier <br>Please stay back for the ending credits of the movie<br>You&#39;ll get what I mean when you watch it 🤐😬
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=36">0:36</a> I didn’t see this
well the theme music is copied in a netflix series called &quot;RAY&quot;
I&#39;m only watching this movie because of Florence. Nothing else
Females movies like muscular type ..are just fiction...which can&#39;t be true ....men musculine is best then female 😂
I cringe at the super obviously fake Russian accent. Like did they not do proper training?
Watched it last night. What an utter piece of garbage. And I thought marvel couldn&#39;t do worse than Loki. Even DC&#39;s crap is starting to look good after this
She: what is the plan 🤔 <br>Natasha: my plan is to drive us away 😁<br>She: the plan sucks 😑
Meh
Waited and disappointed
Guys if you go to google and search black widow cast, Robert Downey Jr&#39;s name is there as Tony stark. But he never came in the movie 😭
Spoilers
I love the bang bang bang part . It goes will with the music
This Music is hitting
Really good movie. Another hit for Marvel. Post credit scene is pretty exciting.
Disappointed
Honestly, there is nothing interesting about this movie.
And remember kids, you have ol&#39; China and the CCP to thank for the virus that probably cost you your job, hobbies, social life, and your favorite movies being pushed back!
Just saw this in theaters A little bit ago tonight and I literally was clapping at the end because this movie was a straight up masterpiece this movie was Hella better than Captain Marvel movie
No one trailer is good. The movie is worst marvel universe and worst director made this
Saw it  today, it was awesome!
HOPPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😄😍
Great movie just finished watching it
I LOVE Scarlet Johannsen
i want to see thanos story 🙏😩
Me looking at the trailer right before I watch it at the theaters today lol
Impact Of Scarlett Johansson First Day Of Box Office 35 Million Dollars Worldwide. Even In The Pandemic.
is it just me or do y’all feel the need for a marvel budapest movie with Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner?
What a letdown
The trailer was so badass tho...
I think it need louder music.
shouldve released this 2 years ago
Spoilers all the men in this movie are made to look like they&#39;re stupid and weak you know because man bad right. What a f*<b>***</b> joke Marvel has become
Such a poser😒🥱
July 10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>2021<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I watched it
At least we know additional story of how Captain saved others from the Raft. Plus some Budapest scene. Thanks Marvel.
Coming here After watching film....
Yelena is the new best Marvel character change my mind
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=8">0:08</a> We don&#39;t get a closer and extended shot of this scene.
sharikum ബ്ലാക്ക്‌ വിഡോ ക്ക് എന്ത് പവർ ആണ് ഉള്ളത്🤔🤔
Anyone after release?
Daughter of jim hopper? Ahh, she must have superpowers
To be honest I liked the movie but it didn&#39;t feel like a fitting farewell movie for Natasha.. they just wanted to introduce some new character in the movie for  phase 4 and  taskmaster didn&#39;t got justice as much as she should...maybe in the future she will...
Where are the women in this movie? I see just dudes.... Stupids of Hollywood..
Very sad. Because this movie was so boring. Scarlett&#39;s last Marvel film deserved better. If the Russo brothers had directed this film it would have been even better. I really feel sorry for Scarlett.
D.I.S.A.P.P.O.I.N.T.E.D.!
Most boring movie
More - you g0 girl f3minist pr0paganda
Captain Marvel is the worst movie ever
Song: we are gods
girl boss!
such a waste of TaskMaster
It was awesome love the film!!🖤
One of the best trailers  I ever saw
Who’s here after they watched the movie
I saw this movie today and as always Scarlett is stunning, so cool especially Florence! She is marvelous. I hope to see her more in another movies.
Who are watched..🖐️
Me gustó la película&quot;SOBRE TODO CUANDO SE LANZA AL VACÍO POR LA HERMANA 👸🏻💕🗽 DIVERTIDA Y CONSECUENTE CON LOS CÓMICS 🗽👍🏻 SATISFECHA MINERVA 👄 🇮🇱🗽🇨🇵 Vivian Jasbleydy Castro Chaparro
Coming back here after like a year just finishing watching the movie and BOY was it good! (in my opinion), let me know what are your guys thoughts???
movie shudve came out on dis+ for free during the pandemic. C
Bgm next level 😳
i watched the full thing now
I don&#39;t buy ScarJo as a Russian woman.
Or July 9th 2021
Who&#39;s here after (finally) watching Black Widow!?
Hopper is Alive..
Just saw this movie in theaters today
They butchered my boy Taskmaster
This should’ve came out way earlier but it’s still a great movie
Was this movie better than Captain Marvel?
I only watch male super hero movies. Sorry Disney.
Came back here after seeing this and I can confidently say that this should have came out before Captain Marvel.
The music in this trailer was better than the movie<br><br>Makes sense why, it&#39;s We Are Gods by Audiomachine. Not a marvel composer.
Black widow: Guys! Just reminding you my solo movie comes out tomarrow! May 1st 2020<br>1 year and 2 mounths later <br>Iron man: I don&#39;t think there&#39;s actually a movie coming. <br>Marvel: Sorry guys, false alarm.<br> 🤣🤣🤣
boring
imagine making the movie an extra 29.99 a month that would be crazy right? ...Right?
The movie is really good everyone. Just watched it. Good action. Good connection to the past and future of MCU. Some shocking reveals.
who is here after watching the movie it was amazing
Whatever
Award.
I AM CRYING. CRYING. <br>I JUST CAME BACK FROM WATCHING THE MOVIE AND IM SOBBING
Nice mon
This should came out in 2016 or 2017 after Age of Ultron or Civil War. She shouldn&#39;t died in Endgame and we could&#39;ve get Black Widow 2 by now.
You don&#39;t want to be sad . <br>But .. <br>There is no Tony Stark Cameo there .
Best movie ever!!!
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
If they make Bucky the main villain for Black Widow 2, the movie can serve a purpose as a prequel before Natasha joins the Avengers
Honest review: those of you who are big marvel fans like me will enjoy the movie but it’s no infinity war it’s not wandavision it’s a great movie in theatres tho
This happened before infinity war
And here I thought she died.....
“May 1 2020”
pog trailer
Just saw the movie and what i hated was that this soundtrack from the trailer is not even in the movie :(
£19.99 to stream WITH a subscription to Disney+.  No chance.
Finally out today!
It’s finally out!!!!
Spoiler:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Well Clint&#39;s in trouble.
You guys, I think Black Widow&#39;s the One. The underdog who brings the MCU togeth- <br>Disney- She dead.
I saw her Dad and thought &quot;heh heh Iron Comrade heh heh heh &quot;.
No: Budapest<br>Yes: Budapesh
What&#39;s the name of the melody?
Just came here to see this one more time before the movie
Ok I watched so many bad reviews before I watched the movie... Finally watched it for myself and I really liked it more than I thought I would&#39;ve. The very end made me emotional.
Loved the movie 😍 The last scene just made me want to watch Infinity War and Endgame all over again.
I just want to count how many people are here after watching the movie.
Black Widow was amazing
Who is also here after watching the movie? ;)
Feminist trash !    This will fail. LMAO  !
Movie is trash.  GET WOKE GO BROKE !
Real fiction its funny because is no black agents in hungry just like they are no black or white agents in china or Japan the story line of making them from these countries instead of maybe south Africa or something
QUESTION FOR PEOPLE WHO SAW THE MOVIE. Does it contain infinity war or endgame spoilers? Because my cousin, who just started watching mcu, wants to go to Black widow in theatres, but she hasn&#39;t seen infinity war or endgame yet. She has seen from ironman to civil war. So my question, does it have any endgame or infinity war spoilers? Maybe an after credit scenes contains one? Maybe there&#39;s a flashback to when she dies?
That Robot Chicken sketch so funny where he made a sim of her. I like Silver Sable better but I wish she had Blond hair.
I just watched it. It was amazing.
I think the hunter is Hawkeye.
This was just awful. I wanted to like it very much...every step it hurt itself with plot contradictions and the writing and improv they kept in was so incredibly bad. Also the bad guy was terrible - the entire third act is awful. The family writing is so bad.<br>Anyone know you can blow up a sky city with one shotgun bullet? smfh. Even the bad guy at the end - after johanson blew her up - you think shes going to forgive her? They even talk about how removd all the sexual organs of the leads. wow. Grateful this garbage didnt come out before the election.
I just wach it😅
I saw it today and GUYS IT&#39;S AWESOME
OMG! I&#39;m crying 😭😭😭
I really just saw the movie
Just got back watching this movie in theater today. F to the Covid.
The movie was amazing!!!!!!
The part at the end when he stepped on the shield and threw it was 🔥
And here we are over a year later. Finally.
Just saw the movie, this is one of the best movies in the MCU!!
Finally seeing it tomorrow 😍😍
on my way to see it in the cinema right now!
Tommorow this movie is going to release🤞🤞
I just watched the film. It’s good.
Nat: I am done running.<br>Also Nat: RUNNING IN THE WHOLE TRAILER.
I wanna know what the music in this is
Florence Florence just WOW!!!!❤️
Violence, arms, violence arms, violence and even more arms, more violence and more arms. We learn violence is the solution! Thank you for that message North America. But, please keep it and stay out.<br>PEACE
She should have gotten her own movie before Captain Marvel.
Somehow the delay in the release of this movie has just made me even less interested in seeing it.
Just got back from the cinema! What an amazing film!!!
WHOSE WATCHED IT OMG IM LOST FOR WORDS IT WAS AMAZING
Rocky and Bullwinkle
sacrificar historia por  política<br>si esta película trae un panfleto en vez de entretener<br>se la pueden quedar completa
Seeing this today!!! Can’t wait it’s gonna be awesome 😎
This should have come out way before the mess that was Captain Marvel.  Find The Critical Drinker&#39;s channel and watch his videos about the Marvel Universe - spot on.
Blah. Lets hope the real Far from home trailer comes out when this does😁😁😁
just saw the film in south korea and i give 7 out of 10
I wish Captain Marvel&#39;s movie was replaced by this movie
10 years too late
R.I.P  Natasha Your Actions in MCU Movies MISS me a lot 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
watching the movie tommorow HELLL YEAH
Yawn! Don’t give a crap about Marvel anymore. Garbage.
It&#39;s been One month since this trailer released and the movie still isn&#39;t out <br>M waiting for the movie eagerly
OMG <br>Taskmaster is just copying my fav avengers <br>He is copying Captain America (shield)<br>He is copying hawkeye (bow and arrow)<br>He is copying Natasha&#39;s fighting skills <br>He is copying black panther (claws)
Maybe there’ll be a sequel called:<br>Black Widow and Hawkeye <br><br>Where they show what happens in Budapest.<br>Not very likely but MAYBE.
Is this independent movie bc I&#39;m not watch all marvel movies but I want to go cinema for this movie
Steve:Evolution Of Black Widow Movie 2009-2009!!!
Soo I’m going on a date with my bf to see this movie but I’m not a huge marvel or dc fan but this movie seems sick like it’s really cool.
Another Hollywood movie filmed in Budapest.
This movie is going to be such trash. Scarlet jo can&#39;t carry a movie by herself and her black widow performance isn&#39;t even that good. Only gets hype because fans boys and nerd virgins that pay for Onlyfans will pay to see her in tights.....sad what movies have become
excited
Loki&#39;s been keeping me occupied, but I&#39;m excited to finally see a new marvel movie!
I&#39;m new 2 avengers I saw it all in a week nd now I&#39;m confused 💔💔<br>Y did they kill black widow?????<br>+ Y is there a movie after she died in endgame??!??? <br>+ I can&#39;t imagine an avengers movie without ironman 💔<br>( is he really dead) 😭😭😭😭
Anyone who gets beat up by black widow is considered a lucky man
Only 4 Days Aways
We wait 1.5 years and now this movie is out in 5 days, we passed the mission.
The BGM is awesome right I love it♥
Ya solo queda días para ver 😍😍💗💗💗💗💪💪💪💪✊✊👍👍👍🤏🤏🤏👌👌👌🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🎥🎞️🎥🎞️🎥🎞️
Apparently bullets can&#39;t go through both the back and front windscreens of a vehicle. Maybe it&#39;s one of those magical taxi&#39;s with a bullet proof devider sprinkled with Hollywood fairy dust that makes it invisible 😂
From May 1st of 2020 to July 9th of 2021; such a long wait
Utter tripe.
WOW wajib nnton Nnti di bioskop
Song ?
the fact that im finally seeing this movie in a couple of days makes me wanna cry
Sad, pathetic. So disappointing to see Scarlett Johansen dropping pants for food by making this movie.. rating: HIGHLY AVOID!
This looks hella good
Wouldn&#39;t have been a marvel film without an over the top CGI midair fight with explosions 🙄<br><br>They could&#39;ve gone all Mission Impossible, spy-filmy, and bucked the trend of a normal &#39;avenger&#39; movie (considering she&#39;s a mere mortal), but noooo, they have to go all BIG EXPLOSIONS!!!!!1 and dumb it down massively.
For the feminists
She may not have &quot;super powers &quot; that&#39;s why she is strong AF and fights so inten5
I’m confused, I thought she died in endgame?
i like scarlett but this trailer sucks.
is this before endgame?
Wowwwww
I would say this is good as male counter parts movie. Or even better because filming during covid-19.  It should count as little better than others because covid-19. I hope to watch
なんか恥ずかしいンゴ
It’s weird how we were waiting so long for a black widow movie to come out but no that it’s out it’s weird that I think it came out  with this so fast
This looks so shite hahahahha
Can she get her own video game too
Booooooooring
Now who wanted a series of black widow
In an alternate universe, we saw it already in 2020.
Things
Is that Hopper from stranger this
lockdown is going on in india <br>miss u nat 😣😣😣 what to do 😣😣😣
Disappointing.  I loved black widow but this looks like more woke girl power trash.  They should have just gone with a good story, black widow is a strong woman , they don’t need to ram more of this feminist propaganda trash down my throat anymore.  I think I will pass on this film.  Screw it, my money my choice, marvel you are alienating your fans, you’re gonna follow Star Wars and be dead to your customers.
this came out a year ago and the movie is finally gonna be out in 7 days. 💀
Yay!
What about telugu version
At least we got a good new Black Widow (Florence Pugh) and thrilling air-battle scene.
I cant wait till it comes out
I love Scarlet J. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑
Anyone here know if cinemas in the U.K.  Well Scotland are open?? I&#39;m seriously needing too see this film! Anyone knows anything let me know please.  Thank you 😊
She&#39;s been my favourite Avenger ever since the beginning and I&#39;m not just saying it because the film looks Absolutely a fuking making she dusna need a suit hand her a plank of wood and she could kill with it! I&#39;ve gotta go see this film on the 5th it&#39;s only the 1st away too check out if my local cinema is even open first!
&quot;I tell people my sister moved out west...&quot; Worst trailer opening line ever.
Im so excited for this although it was delayed
My favourite villain
The soul of the MCU and the glue that sticks the Avengers together is gone:(💔
Black Widow :- <b>gets a movie</b><br>Black Panther :- *gets a game <br>Hawkeye :- *dies
ms only produces fast food movies~
Another mad as hell film, what happened to Little House on The Prairie?
ahhhh this movie is gonna come out in 10 days after 2 years of it being delayed so excited for it !!!
So the Russians did get Jim Hopper and turn him into one of their own.
the bad guy in this movie looks and is soooo cooool
July 9th sent me here.
I wonder when the snowflakes will start an uproar because you have Americans portraying Russians. Because God forbid an actor……..you know……..ACTS!
That BGM 😍😍😍😍😍
10 days away ahhhh!!!
I just bought my tickets, so hype! It&#39;s finally happeningggg
I hope black widow will highlight her national costume&#39;s capabilities 😃 and her character that will make her mark. Widow shouldve had her movie first to take her seriously in every scene! the MCUniverse movies have. She spent her whole life performing double time to match the powerfuls as a woman, overseer to the boys personal issues, theyre squabbling here and there along with her dark past! keeping this group assembled as long as possible!! Who will hold the team together now shes gone?!  I hope i can see her with her mom, even if she cant have birth, Natasha is the mother of the Avengers!!!
I already know the ending she dies in endgame!
They didn&#39;t say May 1, 2020, so...
And they say girls are weak
This is the most awaited marvel movie.<br>Agreee!!!
Why this much time to bring it on
Florence 😍
My idea it opens with her talking then to a shot in Budapest and then if marvel did everything we wanted then a post credit scene of her claiming the mountain on vormir
I will watch this movie only because of iron man
Clint barton
WE&#39;RE SO CLOSE!
The suspense is out.O. T. Fagbenle plays the role of Taskmaster(villian) in this movie.
Camera work looks cheap Adobe after effects.
Spoiler: She won&#39;t die in this movie.
I love you 💓 black widow 329
Look good like how task master suit

Wasnt she dead or aomething
We have only 12 days left after a year and 2 months the wait is finally over. Hopfully
Thor: Guys I can explain<br>Cap and Tony: Your getting four movies while we only get 3? How is that fair?<br>Nat and Bruce: 3? We only got one!<br>Clint: You guys are getting movies?
Anyone..stranger things fan?..Jim hopper is there❤❤
Thanks Stan lee
Bollywood trailer &quot;RAY&quot; copied Black Widow&#39;s background music 🤬 !!!<br><br>please Report that Trailer mcu fans !!!!
Sources are the telling that the movie has already released in the parallel universe 🤔
Another get woke go broke waste of time film.
its out on july 9th, took them long enough :| <br>i mean woohoo im so excited
who is here after bollywoodwallah
There&#39;s something about? Yelena that I don&#39;t trust? (I think working for Taskmaster?)
I&#39;m just saying, that in avengers endgame when the redskull is like NATASA SON OF IVAN. barton is like JUST BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOUR DADDYS NAME JUST THAT MEAN WE SHOULD TRUST HIM? Natasha, I DIDN&#39;TKNOW HIS NAME. wtf how can you believe him if you didn&#39;t know your fathers name in the first place?!
Scarlett Johnson is on another level
The actress running her mouth trashing on the character in Iron Man 2 made me lose all interest in this now.<br>Her current year views make me think this will be woke trash now. Maybe I&#39;ll take a look at it when I can watch it for free. Not getting my money.
I&#39;ve loved Marvel Comics and their characters since I was a kid. Too bad Marvel sold out to a POS company like Disney!! Will never watch a Marvel movie ever again.
“On May 1st”
I&#39;ve already booked my ticket, Uk we have a July 7th release
Release this please 🙂
When is this releasing
Melina and Mason are Task Master .. they are the villains. Yelena is working for Ross and in Post credits scene it is revealed that red gaurdian fakes his death and hawkeye with his children at Black Widows grave.
Where does this movie fit in the marvel cinematic order? It would have to be before endgame right
Wow rachel weisz is in this
I have to see my bae in her first standalone marvel film
Well, too late, who care and what is the point, i mean wake up, tje era is over.... Sorry. Loved what you dud guys but noe its time to move on. Stop capitilazing on past succes. Be like IM us and go on with your life.  JUST IMPROVE.
for anyone who wants to know the soundtrack: &quot;Audiomachine - We are Gods&quot;
I didnt care for this movie but then ... I seen Dushka! Nice :)
She was irrelevant in the Avengers series 🤷🏼🤷🏼 she was just there to be there lol
Task master tiene la habilidad de ser Black Panther el capitan america black widow y clint Barton. Jajaja
I couldn&#39;t watch it till the end. I started crying, because I know she&#39;s dead
they say they didnt give natasha a memorial in endgame because of this movie, “she would get more screen time than tony”, hold on, tony got 3 movies and a memorial, natasha got 1 movie and no memorial, how is that balanced exactly?
Probably will earn more than 1 billion dollars, yet all the hardcore feminists will say that men don&#39;t watch female led movies and that it is the reason for Charlie&#39;s Angels small boxoffice 🤦🤦
I use to have nothing been  then I got this family I guess she had two family’s she can count on😢😢😢❤️😔
So, she survived? I see 2021 cars.. hahaha
anyone else still  watching the trailer
See You In May 1😃😃
July 9 2021
They changed the name of this video, it used to say Final trailer
at least we know she doesn’t die in this movie??
What if Hawkeye was taskmaster lol
She’s been my favourite since I was a little girl. And she kept the position even after Wanda and Captain Marvel. I love them too. But nothing can win my childhood queen
I hope like really hope we see Buckynat like in the comics.
“Natasha don’t slouch”
Rays background score 👍🏻
So yes, Netflix copied this theme for Satyajit Ray series.
i think this is the best trailer in the history of marvel movie trailers
Um <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybji16u608U&amp;t=64">1:04</a> Jim hopper from stranger things
Too much like Power Rangers No Thanks
last scene say natasha 💥💥💥 coming zoon avengers after 3 years💥
🥰💖
