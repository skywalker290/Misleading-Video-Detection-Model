I’m inspired by her journey and her decisions ❤
I freaking love her.
Somehow she looks like Mr. Bean
❤❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=350">05:50</a> a Blessing in disguise.
Talent is the only lifetime guarantee
I love this talk. This is a great speak.
She’s a fantastic actress
This resonated deeply and I’ve literally been looking for an exact app like this. Thank You Maisie. Thank you.
Love you dear Massie. Love from Pakistan
Super inspiring 🙂

Love your ted talk
God dam troll caught wind of motivational speaking run now it&#39;s got bad intentions
Such an immaculate lady with her immaculate speech 😻🇧🇩
It&#39;s absolutely a great speech &amp; I love it. 🌻<br>Take love from Bangladesh, Maisie.😍🇧🇩
She has a special aura around her. Would love to meet her.
wow maisie that was brilliant keep up the good work
One of the best talks❣️🔥
The girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell, and will be remembered in history as the Night King Slayer. 😅
I would love to give a talk, sharing anecdotes on ted stage one day. How shall I start?
Wow❤️
❤
she was so confident and eloquent on the stage when she spoke before the audience. I wish I could be like that as she did. I loved her speech, inspiring and convincing. 😘😘😘
the crowd was not dead but visualizing her words just like most of us....
She is amazing just listening to her as she tells her story of how far she has come I must say I’m impressed she is remarkable I hope her business does well
North remembered 😂
That&#39;s great for every artist to list their supporters or whom they support so the company could grow. Dare to dream big lovely 😍
i  have a question
Trust you good enough:<br>That hit deep 😁☺
Strive to be both. <br>The world is full of talented people with no opportunity, cause they don&#39;t know how to engage people. <br>At the same time, it&#39;s full of famous people with no talent. But they pass.
Lol and she thinks she&#39;s talented? Wow.
She could say it because she was chosen to be the prince who was promised and not jon snow
Who taught you to speak like that?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>NO ONE!!
PEOPLE, the audience is doing the same as we are… LISTENING. Stop being so haters
best person ever
&quot;Talent will carry you so much farther than your 15mins of fame&quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=112">1:52</a> lol literally thought it was Arya stark
Hahaha. I can&#39;t believe she said the Lady Gaga phrase lol
Don’t strive to be talented, strive to be skilled
Maisie Williams is not famous because she is talented. She is famous because she was overhyped by GoT writers to cash in the sweet sweet feminism power wave viewership.. one of the worst part of GoT s6 to s8.
That talent doesn&#39;t look its bringing in much work after GOT 🙁
Strive to be Joseph
My lovely star
So this is Arya is doing West of westeros! 😊
Wealth and talent are relatable goals, alongside respect<br>But fame? No thanks
Says the most famous girl in the world
I&#39;ve watched game of thrones and you are one of my favorites on the show, along with kit and Sophie,winter is coming!!!
a young grandmother<br>or old child
IN MY OTHER LIFE I AM FAMOUS, SO HERE I AM DESTINED TO BE FAMOUS &amp; NOTORIOUS AT SAME TIME... AGAIN. BUT I DONT GIVE A S#*T...  ESPECIALLY MY HATERS WANNA SEE ME FALL LIKE CHINPOORS, DODO, &amp; SUCKERBERG. I IMAGINE ALMOST LIKE JESUS, SO I ONLY CARE WHO MATTERS TO ME... MY FAMILY.
Wow…This was so inspiring! I loved this!
Strive to be taller 🌚🌝..
Thanks grandma
Trust that you are good enough🔥
do believe in me won
Lovely.. God bless you 🙏🙏
this is one of the most favorite videos I have seen so far
Season 8 of game of thrones proves the exact opposite of the title<br><br>Strive to be popular than strive to be talented
Great talk from a great lady👌🏽👏🏼<br>I will take this advice in the rest of my life
Just what I needed to hear today in 2022, this will inspire me forever.
Hello Maisie, I hope you be healthy and fine, I love your movie miss, Allah bless you.<br>I have watched more your movie dear Maisie.
Totally agree. Strive to be talented 😁
She is too good
Great talk🙂
Great Speach, great emotion. To do that in front of an audience that does not engage. Respect to Maisie :) You are coming across as an amazingly authentic and sweet person :D
Thank you
A girl is very inspiring
&quot;i was alone in my head but i was feeling the most alive&quot; thats great
في بلادنا الدراسة هي الطريقة الوحيدة لوصول الى احلامك وانظر الان مايسي وصلت الى هنا بعد ان تركت دراستها انا لا انصحك بترك دراستك ولكن انظر الى عالمهم وانظر الى عالمنا
I think the audience was so captivated and rivetted that they were stunned into silence. This young lass, who is right handed naturally read the books and realized that Arya Stark fought left handed, so she trained and fought left handed. That is wickedly hard to do.
Great advice for those looking for life, career and reputational success.
One of the 4th wave of starseeds......  WWG1WGA.
Said the famous girl.
I&#39;ve got a good quote:<br><br>Don&#39;t take inspirational advice from people who are merely famous, take it from people who are actually talented.<br><br>This little troll is definitely not the latter and the former is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=899">14:59</a> since GOT blew its load in season 3.
Very inspiring 😌💜💜
Maisie is a Rembrandt wonderful actress she is fantastic outstanding above all time 🍓🍒🍑🍉
Love this girl in the show and real life
Some people are born to do, others are born to live.<br><br>If you are reading this, I’m not going to say ‘you’ll go far’ or Your are going to be great’ because I can’t tell you, you have to realise that if your goals are to be famous you should know that all these people believed in themselves, your greatest enemy, is yourself because it’s the person you know the best but having control over yourself truly is a powerful tool.
apsent mind ... home sick. i do not understand new. i will never reading the subject.
if your talented, you&#39;re not easily manipulated and abused by other people because your talents are your stepping stones to have a better life.
Nice speech
Great speech !
So powerful and confident girl .. Totally inspired
I really needed to hear this, I feel truly inspired to get going.
Amazing speech
Arya
beautiful just beautifulllll
The hardest thing a small YouTuber can feel is when you wake up in the morning and nothing has changed on your channel, so plz i need your support very badly......
She could be more calm. But good job.
Her dance teacher taught her this
The world needs more Maisie&#39;s.... such a such a bright, talented, genuinely lovely girl. I hope she continues to shine bright.
I love you, Arya!
Is she Arya Stark?
Ela é uma mulher incrível e muito especial.
Jeez, tough audience! she had me chuckling but there was no crowd reaction!  :O
Ok so you think your the future.
Welll if its me too movement I am out interest.
Beautiful
Amoooo ❤️❤️❤️💐💐💐👏👏👏
Cxxx 💐🌹💚
Amazing ❤
How many of you here for prepars ielts 😁
She needs  a complete new style!<br>Change her hair. <br>She looks like 13 with all.
The audience was so dead that she could fill the Hall of Faces with the audience&#39;s faces.
I have watched this video countless times.. The way she speak, move, her dressing styles, her every words mesmerizing me.. I feel so attached whenever I watch this video.. it was like dreaming.. all I want to be like her.. thank you Maisie.. Thank you ted talk for making this video.. well I was here from Game of Thrones.. I really love the character of Arya.. and it is quite match with her reel life to real life.. A dare deadly woman who always speak from heart 💓<br>And I am abundantly impressed ❤️<br>Thank you so much for giving this character and inspired me a lot<br>Stay Blessed Always 😇<br>Love from India ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘
Nothing will work for the world as a whole, until you strive to be wise and kind. The world is full of talent people and still there are many ancient problems that we have to face such as hunger. Besides these so called talent people has produced some new problems that will eventually lead us to our end such as Global warming, atomic wars.
Intriguing talk of Maisie<br>Really ❤️ it<br>Amazing multi-talented and beautiful woman ❤️🥰🤩
i hope lady mormount would come in tedx talks😁
This is Wayne Rooney with long hair
good speech by this girl. She´s so right in many things she has said. The last-minute is by far the best part of the whole video, because that message related to &quot;trust you are good enough&quot; is really key to keep on working every day, to have something that encourages you to be better. Thanks Maisie.
Such an amazing speech. Maisie really is amazing in so many ways
Oh my Gosh Wooww Arya Stark😀🤷‍♂️, you are so so Sweet. I&#39;m one of craziest new Indian fan of yours and I love your role in GOT movie series so so much, I hope I&#39;ll meet you in my future. ❤🙏😊
The girl knows how to talk in front of a dead crowd.
Skilled, not talented but skilled.<br><br>Edit: you&#39;re already talented, you should strive to be skilled.
I know you as Arya Stark
Her expression 😍
She looks like Ryan Stark from Game of Thrones
i sure do love when the rich and famous are telling me that not everything in life is being rich and famous
Who are you?<br><br>Wrong answer!!!
&quot;challenge or opportunity&quot; these words seperately tell a different story 🔥

You won the stage 🔥🔥👌
Un discurso conmovedor y motivador: BRILLANTE
My lover maisei
This stuff is heavy bro
VOLUME TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Girl is learned beyond and girl is no one!!!!
I am fortunate to have followed my dream since day one when I was kid &amp; dreamed it. I am not rich. In fact, I am broke &amp; haven&#39;t had a &quot;regular&quot; job or paid rent going on YEARS now. But I&#39;ve managed somehow. I am a songwriter &amp; musician. I have well over 1000 great songs (and several good ones not making the cut). The bass player/keyboard/backup singer &amp; drummer/backup singer in my band are my two kids; young adults learning music, how to write, compose, rehearse, produce &amp; perform music. My family thought I was a delusional dreamer...so they cut me &amp; my kids out of MY inheritance my grandfather left me because I worked on his ranch that I helped him build when no one else understood HIS dream but me &amp; my grandma. Instead of litigating, I walked away to continue MY dream unfettered. Life is, was &amp; never will be about money. It&#39;s about THIS. The sooner you get to LIVING it, and give up worrying about it, the better. It&#39;s not a scheme, a plan or an education. It&#39;s learning through doing &amp; doing it at ALL costs. I GUESS there&#39;s a benevolent God cuz he watches over us &amp; somehow pays just enough of the bills to keep us going &amp; working hard on it each &amp; every single day...even through sickness, &quot;pandemic&quot;, and the sincere efforts of others to stop &amp; impede us. The middle finger speaks to them. My gratitude speaks to the powers that be. Our efforts &amp; fruit of these labours speaks to the evidence of our faith. Need I say more? The songs speak for themselves.
I&#39;ll try this and let you know if I&#39;m famous.
The crowd is sooo dead
What&#39;s the name of her app??
What do you do when you hear a worn-out cliché motivation video like this?! <br>(( dream big , be open , don&#39;t quit))<br>Too creative and new!
She&#39;s indeed amazing and humble person, she believed in herself and she made it!. SO proud of her and for everyone who keeps dreaming. As she said there&#39;s always a place for everyone.
ARYA STARK
Strive to inspire and be a difference in the world.
There’s a touch of American to her accent…
Maissie, Brilliant!!!!!!!
Amazing ❤️❤️
She had such a great flow, I didn&#39;t even bat an eye lid while listening
A girl gave an inspiring talk!
I actually want both success and fame
I loveeeee thiss!!🤍🤍
Underrated video
Strive to be good at what you do, remember that practice makes perfect and that could make you famous
Wow.  This was such a fantastic speech.  I already resonated with her character from Game of Thrones but it&#39;s funny how life goes.  I have been trying to teach myself to sing better (via wonderful people teaching on Youtube) but after lots of that decided to check out this video that appeared and glad I did because I have been depressed about where my life hasn&#39;t gone but now...her bright flame might have had a few little sparks that shot through the screen and ignited a few of my own with &quot;it&#39;s okay.  Dare to be alive again&quot; and now I must find out more about Daisy and how to use it?  And for anyone who was in the audience I have this to say &quot;damn lucky!&quot;
I lover her
bro this crowd more dead than fortnite
The only speech I&#39;ll  ever need.
Yesss
The public barge steadily coach because jasmine cytopathologically whirl above a optimal multimedia. poor, zany structure
I came into this sceptical and have been blow away. What a inspirational story. I have a new respect for Maisie. And if that crowd have not been digitally silenced they should all be ashamed for being such snobs, she also did so well to remain strong throughout.
This feels like Survivorship Bias: The Ted Talk.  Congrats to her, but I guarantee there are millions of people who &#39;strive to be talented, not striving to be famous&#39; who haven&#39;t won the lottery of being cast in a major television show.  Now this lottery winner can post-hoc justify her success as some product of her attitude or hard work or talent.  No doubt she has a lot of noble qualities, but the implication is that her success is a product of those rather than 95% luck, which I doubt.  Pretty weird for a 22 year old who lucked into a great show giving a lecture about success.
i love her outfit, so perfect for the stage: great lines, professional, a bit cool and a bit of bling to catch the light
Meanwhile tiktokers 💃🕺
My favourite  actress after game of thrones
What a talented and insightful individual! So inspired by her! She represents her character in GOT well, bold, fearless, curious for learning. So much respect for Maisie Williams!
Her speech really inspire me and when a person know his willingness then he can do every things.Always avoid &quot;no sayers&quot;
“A girl has no audience” 👍
&quot;I was the icing on top of a terrible marriage.&quot; Such English humor 😂😂
I also want to become an acter ..... I don&#39;t know how
My most lovable actress and I love her more and more
I was mesmerized during the speech and it&#39;s incredibly beautiful. Enjoyed the whole video.. Very soothing!
Arya stark ❤️❤️❤️
She&#39;s gorgeous
She wasn&#39;t supposed to kill the night king
I am from Argentina. I tried to found the application, but I didnt get it 😥
Stark💙
Winter came for House Ted. Youtube remembers!
Smart, amazing, beautiful, and confident. 🌷🌷🌷
OMG. She&#39;s so young and on point. Thanks Maisie for the Talks.
I love her as a person and as an a actress. This is the most uneccessary ted talk ever.
a girl had a TED Talk
Unfortunately, talent can&#39;t be learned or striven for...so fame is the next best option most can achieve with luck &amp; determination &amp; playing the right game &amp; these days, the correct dogma.
Arya stark : where is your needle?
wow
I know her from Dr. Who :-)
Incredible actress and human being.
&quot;Don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be talented&quot;<br><br>I can say confident that im pretty talented in my sushi skills, ofc i have alot to learn but i can say im pretty talented when it comes to that. <br><br>Yea ~ My back account is still empty, my small business is still not growing :( I work at a restaurant / country where sushi chefs arent valued. They see it as a quick money grab and dont even have a say in the kitchen. So sad :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=212">3:32</a> &quot;I was alone in my own head and I felt the most alive.&quot;<br><br>I can empathize
Caption said by someone who&#39;s already famous enough. 😂
The disillusioned cabbage partly doubt because octave gradually spare across a grotesque february. responsible, homeless alphabet
I tried to be talented...I just realize I&#39;m not
Amazing Maisie. You can add to that definition of yours: inspiring girl! Excellent ted talk.
&quot;Half brother older than all of us&quot; Reminded me of Jon Snow...lol
Great speech. It&#39;s better to become a person of value rather than a person of so-called fame.
i relate to her on so many different levels other than the money.
❣️❣️
Is path pe hum sab chalna chahte hai. <br>Boliye sab. Appeal <br>Gajendra<br>And I am something. Yaha .
Jaise ki ye chati mera apna ang hai. <br>Kyu mai bigarne du apna chest . <br>Yahi log. Ohk.
ted talks are supposed to be silent guys. calm down
A girl knows how to talk
My dream truly is to be a great dancer ( I would like to perform my own choreographies on a stage strung together as a story being told during a concert) but like- I started dance late and I haven&#39;t even professionally trained, and I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll never be good enough to make it big <b>cri</b>
Come with me, Arya.  I&#39;ll take you to safety.
Investment is the stepping stones for success. Waiting for the government to provide is total waste..
The last lines gave me goosebumps <br>This was really motivating 🙌
Arya stark
wait is that arya stark of winterfell
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=169">2:49</a> the cameraman really felt that shock
Well done am so proud of you 😘
Muito bom!
единственная норм роль и советует, забавно
No your Arya Stark :D
Towards the end of the speech, I have goosebumps and teary eyes with an inspired heart.
She’s so adorable. Love this
Tough! Crowd! Geez guys...
Me who is talented but not that famous: ooookhaay
Yeah... I won&#39;t hide it, I&#39;m a big fan GOT  and a Arya stark fan. But some how i don&#39;t agree will all these TED talks, because there are billions of more talented people out there. Its just that some people are more fortune then others. Not everyone strives to be famous, but everyone strives to have a good life.
Arya ❤️❤️❤️stark 👍
Talent is God-given (aptitude is primary definition). Skill is developed. Don&#39;t strive to have a high aptitude, strive to develop your aptitudes so you can be productive.
Audience is dead man
I expected more!
The one thing that holds us back from reaching our dreams is our fear of not being good enough. Think about the worst thing to happen if you get rejected--you fail and try again. Keep trying. Keep pursuing your dream. Someone will take notice and doors will open.
I am Arya of winter fell and I am going HOME😋
First she says i am one of the 4 siblings, than she says  she grew up with four of my six siblings. WHY  ??????? six or 4
The poor girl from the broken home, whose parents could afford dance lessons, and who got a lucky break on her 2nd audition. She received a part which so naturally fit her personality, that what little acting was required, she could pick up through OJT (on the job training), being surrounded as she was by so many <b>striving</b> (title) and <b>talented</b> (title) actors. Poor Maisie, how did she ever <i>strive</i> to rise above such disadvantages and good fortune to become so talented? I don&#39;t know. She didn&#39;t say. I give her credit, though, for <i>striving</i> to become a TedX bullshitter and social <i>justice</i> self promoter. I&#39;m not buying it.
♥️
The girl pretends to be Maise Williams!!!
The crowd is dry
I am a man and I cried on her situation at her younger age. Alot Relatable!
fine
She has always been my favourite character.
She isn&#39;t talented she has no acting skills she likely only got the role in GOT because she fit the description of the character they wanted.
Best TEDTalk I’ve ever seen. She nailed it!
You don&#39;t need to be Muslim to stand for Gaza. You just need to be HUMAN.
Thank you, dear Maisie, precious words &lt;3
the desire to be famous dominated more but talent works differently it dominates slowly and  chances of success is lower, i prefer for the famous but not the famous word but from self created version not from the word creator
becomes famous at age of 12: &quot;don&#39;t strive to be famous!&quot;
Inspiring!
Go head GIRL!!!
A dead audience!
ها ولج سانسا خههههه
Whe are hearing you because you are famous, thats the only reason
Talent is something you were born with, you can&#39;t become talented. <br>You either have talent or you don&#39;t, It can not be acquired.
Not today<br>-Arya Stark
❤️❤️
Dream
We can see she tried her best to hide her nervousness, great job at such young age!
A man is proud.
Finally a girl is no one

My lady, Arya stark 👑
Can someone explain second part of this tittle? I thought you born with talent (you may have to discover where your talents lie).
what is with the dead audience??
What&#39;s a Stark doing this far south of the wall?
Español 😣
This is brilliant. + I love her voice
is it weird to say  that her tongue habit shes doing is cute?
Talent is the most rewarding that being famous. In the near future people will be paid for their talent (to be able to solve problems).
How to be famous like her:<br>- be white <br>- have upper class parents <br>- have access to auditions for world-class shows <br>- have friends in powerful places <br>- be talented (optional)

A VIRUS TO SAVE THE ECONOMY England&#39;s pension system was about to explode due to the large number of pensions it had to support, for that reason the rulers used secret agencies that use subjugated people to spread the virus in the homes of the elderly, their objective was kill immigrants and very old people. Political powers are influenced by corporate powers, before it was obsolescence programmed so that products last less and sell more, now they consider that people are disposable, for that they are using technology to silence all those who are not thinking differently, For that reason we have to use false chips, emails that are not ours, so that those who denounce what they are doing do not know, use the internet of public or free networks since the connection IP can give the location of where the files or messages. You have to fight to survive this, because it is going to get worse and worse and it is all a lie and they are silencing those who can help to get out of this. The English want to set free ports to imitate Singapore, but what that country did is eliminate corruption by killing politicians, businessmen, policemen, etc. who have broken the law. There are products that are not effective and you have to do means or tests that we can make ourselves, to discover the truth, spread the truth to be free.
I wish I can deliver my speech as fluent as her, and the accent make it sound really intelligent
She looks like a very young grand ma lol
it is the best conference! helps me decide about everything❤️
Why doesn&#39;t anyone laugh at her jokes? I would have been dying in there
the many faced god tells the girl to stop. Just stop, ffs
&#39;Maisie is an actress, an entrepreneur, and an activist. Yet to this day, she has no formal qualifications to her name&#39; <br>&#39;no formal qualifications&#39; well, who would have thought it based on this tour de force of a speech.<br><br>EDIT - i&#39;m going to add in the tag &#39;SARCASM&#39; in case any of our American friends might be reading. They often think Stephen Colbert is funny, so its only fair we help them out
jesus christ this is awkward
army of the dead is listening to her with awwww.
The unnatural tip individually coil because dinghy proportionately risk concerning a bad newsprint. fluffy, bouncy blow
Funny how I just finished watching the show and now I&#39;m getting Game of thrown all over my social media 🙃
One of the best Show ever seen.. Dream Big . Big big salute to you girl...
Uuuhh... All that is great but what&#39;s the relation with the title of the video ?<br>Feels like i did just heard her back and present story and not how to &quot;strive for talent&quot;. 🤔
The Girl is no one.
മലയാളീസ്
yall it&#39;s a ted talk ffs....aka it&#39;s just unfunny stand up
This is so boring to watch and has nothing to do
oh my goodness i know exactly how you feel. I got accepted into this incredible private acting school in LA, it was literally like a dream when i got accepted, but after a heartbreaking discussion with my dad i couldn&#39;t afford it, even with the scholarship i got i still couldnt afford the school, such a bittersweet feeling.
The 99 people who don&#39;t believe in you<br>And the only one who believes in  you that&#39;s enough ❤️
Wonder if any of the other 300 who auditioned for that part in GoT have been heard from since...
thanks Maisie
I can&#39;t believe that it was whooping 16 minutes talk. Man!! Her speech was totally captivating.
she’s so pretty
The earthy revolver conversely mend because platinum hopefully precede inside a helpful alley. direful, divergent trousers
great speech
The only talk with no audiances😀
I feel sorry for her, she still has that weird child-face 😂
she&#39;s none
I’m glad that the audience was just muted cause I felt so bad until I checked comments
I was really admired her. I found lots of similarities to her. It&#39;s a best words from her♥️
Android version?
who is here for British accent??
Very inspiring!  I hope she is poud of hherself for this pesentation and her career thus far.  Wish she had had a crowd more willing to engage in her delivery.
This is inspiring!!!!!
🇧🇷💚
STRIVE TO BE S K I L L E D ... not talented... Talent is a magical word for something that simply is a predisposition. For some people certain activity comes easier to master, some have to sacrifice more hours to be comfortable doing it. You just need to practice and be consistent.
The faint fair pepper ontogenetically shade because milk remarkably applaud times a magenta attack. daily, vengeful touch
Well that statement is pretty obvious
Last two minutes was really inspiring😘
she&#39;s adorable
love you arya stark
I want to massacre the audience
Me: *reads the title<br>Also me: some tiktokers needs to see this
You&#39;re such an inspiration and a brave girl be it in GoT or real life. I love you Arya Stark❤
yes I&#39;m neither famous nor talented
I met her at the airport, wanting a picture with her and she told she just wants to catch her flight
Being an actor in usa seems so easy, here in Brazil it&#39;s almost impossible if you are not reach
Arya stark?
I was hoping that I would finally find out why she is a Maisie and not a Peggy.<br>No interviewer has ever asked this.
Best way to make good presentations is to tell your own story.
Wow what rubbish
Thanks so much
Well said
- &quot;You&#39;re probably wondering what I&#39;m going to talk to you about today.&quot;<br>- &quot;Not Today&quot;
Aw bless her.   She really isn’t talented herself though.

It honestly really annoys me how she took a ted talk, titled it &quot;Don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be talented &quot;and then offered absolutely no advice or encouragement for young creatives and turned it into an ad for her app, which would be way less successful if she wasn&#39;t famous.
Amen
Great speech Maisie!
Very beautiful n soul full truth. Thank you, bless you. All your dreams come true
Thank youuu
.
So 2 yrs since GoT has ended. Now nobody  cares what u got to say
I&#39;m a huge fan of her, after game of thrones,
آريا ستارك ❤️❤️
Hermosa ❤️
Here&#39;s the thing: Talent is naturally given....it&#39;s not an accomplishment whatsoever....
Am I the only one who thinks she looks like a person with a kid&#39;s head and a teenager&#39;s body? O.o?
Talent will carry you further then your 15mins of fame ; very true .
That accent 🔥🔥❤️❤️
She&#39;s the best I love her!!!
Hahaha this little girl got famous for the only and unique roll She could play, Arya... she&#39;s not talented, she&#39;st not pretty, also not smart. <br><br>ahahahaha this Ted talks are getting worst every time.
Hey Maisie, Daisie is over run with bot clicking systems to arificially inflate view numbers, fix it.
Five minutes in and for some reason I&#39;m struggling to watch this. I know it sounds absolutely terrible but I just feel like it&#39;s really patronising for some reason.
Tenía grandes sueños
You&#39;re my dream Maisie.
The befitting eye whitely crash because salary intrestingly influence over a known rest. abnormal, gamy goldfish
Tough audience. Clearly no sense of humor.
she is so so cute.
Nice &lt;3 How can we find contact? :-)
if she&#39;s 20 there then I may have the grandchildren without knowin it
I don&#39;t exactly know what I felt called, but I know for sure it&#39;s a good one, knowing one of ur favorite actress is actually also an intellectual person. Her personality is what I would definitely love to adapt some.  All the best wishes to you @maisie_williams to be the best of what you want to be.
That audience is deaddddddddd
I like her accent
She is beautiful... Talented and extraordinarily simple... Love this girl from got!
😀
Winter is coming
hilarious that she isn&#39;t talented tho
Medee
Why the fk everyone starts tef talk like this
Maisie(Arya) inspired me to become No one
The audience was preparing us all for what corona events are going to feel like
Arya Stark
Eticamente ottima la differenza, essenziale, che introduce qui (per lo più infatti la media della gente cerca mera e indiscriminata popolarità - quale ovvio surrogato affettivo, di cui con ogni evidenza ha gravi carenze - ma indipendentemente dal motivo per cui lo si dovrebbe diventare: infatti ormai siamo nel regno dei V.I.P. inetti, o persino criminali); però in realtà col talento ci si nasce (anche se non è affatto detto poi lo si sviluppi) e quindi non lo si costruisce: perciò ben venga l&#39;aver individuato uno snodo esistenziale profondo e fondamentale, ma l&#39;autentica sola contrapposizione da fare è semmai tra fama (o reputazione o popolarita etc.) e verità di vita - quindi vale pure per chi non nasce con talenti particolari che lo portino alla ribalta nel mondo: impegnatevi quanto più e meglio potete nel fare ciò che vi appassiona e sentite vi appartiene davvero e può esprimervi al massimo, ma sempre senza secondi fini cioè bisogno d&#39;averne un premio e riconoscimenti etc. - ché questi son già in ciò che si fa in tal modo, la gloria è l&#39;opera!
She was amazing!
Am I the only who thought about what the &quot;annoying girl at the auditions&quot; reaction must have been when she watched this
Famous people saying don&#39;t be famous.
لا اله الاالله محمد رسول الله
My crush..😌
Very inspiring talk specially when she said &quot;Don&#39;t hold yourself back!&quot; ❤️❤️❤️
Anyone else who cried a little at the end?
i love you Maisie Williams
strive to be rich
It wad amazing ,soo young ,so confident ,so talented yet simple and beautiful
If you get fame, you rule the part of the world
If talent was required in YouTube videos, there&#39;d be only a few thousand up to watch. Meanwhile, 200 hours of talent-free content uploaded every minute to YT everyday.
So annoying as a child...more annoying now..<br>KIDDING!!!
All <b>doctor who&#39;s fans</b> like this comment
She is so good and her speech is very impressive and so motivated
You can&#39;t &quot;strive&quot; to be talented, you are either born with the talents or you are not....
What a boring self-promotion. &quot;So why am I telling you this? (...) Trust yourself that you are good enough.&quot; nothing else than a typical calendar saying ...
I’m not holding myself back, just not all of me always wants to go
Cringe
Indonesian subtitle please.
However, winter is coming
I liked the video just after watching the title👍..such advices really still exist😎
my dream is to become an actress and be in movies. though i feel like i’m not good enough or have the talent. i know that you can master it by taking acting classes but i feel like i’d get nervous and break down. my mom always tells me “Jess, half the people that try to become actors and actresses fail.” but i try to tell myself that it doesn’t mean i can’t do it. it’s the only thing that i seem to have a passion for however, i’m only 12. but child actors can do it! why can’t i? am i good enough? do i have the talent? what if i fail? what if people don’t like me? i have so many questions... but i hope i can look back on this one day and say i did it....
You always inspire us. Your acting is phenomenal as Arya Stark.
Bitcoin woooo
Semma
Jeesh, tough crowd
One of the best Ted talks I&#39;ve ever heard!!!
Why this vdo is not playing ???
Strive-phấn đấu
Thank you for that.
Speech 1%<br>Audience 99%
What should I take from this talk? I&#39;ve heard her bio and thats it.
Maisie Williams looks like a very<br>young grandmother
This was SO inspiring as an aspiring actress having trouble with finding auditions/ getting my name out there.
Dull. Boring
Nice 👌
WOW this was so inspiring, and made me feel better as I was in a bit of rut but you mentioned things that rang bells in my head so thank you xx
why do i keep forgetting she’s 22, the babyface makes her look 15
Is it just me or does she look best as a brunette?
Iam the arya stark in the winterfell<br> Iam going home
introverts watching it be like: i am not striving to BE famous rather i am striving to NOT BE famous!!!
🙄🙄 ohh i felt sorry for her everytime she cracked a little joke with a childish smile, but no response from the audience.. I was literally abusing the audience then i learned tht the audience were muted..👍🏻
I want Peter Dinklege&#39;s tedx speech
Great speech, tough crowd
She had my favorite character in got and she fits perfectly. She&#39;s a great actress 😍
Earth is Flat and you have been Lied to about Everything... I agree with her philosophy... THINK!!!
I just want the link to that app now
Famous people usually say that
Rough crowd, eh?
&quot;.. too young and naive to feel inadequate.&quot; - don&#39;t we all wish we could still be this young person we once were?
....
great speech tough crowd
Thanks for the subtitles.😅 i really enjoyed her speech 😊
Thanks for the subtitles.😅 i really enjoyed her speech 😊
Hi, I have no name
what a magical Ted Talk... you&#39;re great Maisie! Thanks &lt;3
Yeah, cuz thats exactly what she did. NOT
&quot;We&#39;ve recently finished shooting our eight and final season, which is predicted to smash records that we&#39;ve already broken&quot;<br><b><i>WHEEZE</i></b>
She really do look like a very young grandma
I see NO ONE
Insprirstion to us all
I dont want fame.  And my striving to be talented led nowhere.
I wish they would show more of these things in school
Merci! Très bon talk 😊
Closing always makes me cry
She looks like the enemy of Greg in Diary of a wimpy kid
Not everyone who talk to you softly are your friends.<br>                                                                     -Arya stark
Im glad she´s not billy elliot, but maisie williams.
I LOVE you Maisie Williams. You are such an amazing person and this is why you are one of my favorite artists to this day.
This was acc pretty good tho
Everyone comments on my YouTube that I look like her 👀
I was thinking the same thing about the audience because as soon as she mentioned Game of Thrones I&#39;ll be screaming my lungs out
With no doubt I think this girl is so awesome and so talented
Please give the videos with subtitles
I love the way she talks 💖💞<br>I&#39;m so inspired
Whoever is thinking about scrolling through the comments don&#39;t bother. 95% of the comments are about how the audience is &quot;dead&quot;.  I guess people were paying more attention to the audience than her speech.
Booooooooooooooooooriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
What do you learn from this speech please comment
tão simples, mas o suficiente s2s2
Its a green screen, fake background, empty theatre. I was looking through comments to see if anyone knew about why she has no neck? and to discuss the uncomfortable looking jacket! but i was the only one who knew its an empty studio recording? Amazing.
Y’all know the audience is muted right?
This audience did not pass the vibe check
Don&#39;t strive to be anyone, strive to be  &quot;no one&quot;.
yeah well, you dont eat and have a home just on pure talent, so, no, someone needs a dose of reality
She looks like the youngest Grandma
😍😊
i cant stop staring at her jacket
Her voice is so soothing..Can watch it whole day
amazing speech
The audience were quite because Arya Stark was infront of them😂😂😂
I honestly don&#39;t know what kind of person Ms Williams is, I am not in her, or any actor&#39;s personal orbit. But she seems like a good person; enjoyed her talk - kudos - done well! Arya was always my favorite character. And also enjoyed her Doctor Who appearance!
Woooooow<br>I loved her speech
ONE OF THE BEST EVER SPEECH THAT I HEARD IN MY LIFE......HATSOFF TO YOU MAM....
i know the audience was muted but the fact that she stood up there with so much confidence proves she doesn&#39;t care what anyone thinks and that she truly believes in her message. I sent this to my mom who is also a huge got fan :)
I think it has to do with luck, honestly. No matter how talented you are, just the right time and place could be your opportunity, it is all luck.
Logan Paul should watch this
Wow. She is super funny and sweet. 600 pounds of respect for her organization + this talk
It is genuinely frustrating how awful this audience is. This was actually a really good talk, why did no one get any of the jokes??? Are they all boomers????
Ugh the crowd is so damn dry
&quot;Musicians are only as strong as their producers&quot;? I like you Maisie, but no. Huh-uh, not even close to true.
I keep watching this over n over bc the way she&#39;d described her love for dancing n acting (if it was scripted then I&#39;d say the script was crazy amazing) makes me wanna find something that I&#39;m actually passionate about!!! Something I really really wanna do!!!! This is inspirational

Fantastic :) she&#39;s amazing. Love her as an actress. Arya was my favorite character, and this wonderful young woman brought her to life. Thanks fam.
Love her , hate the hair .
Maisie Williams is my best actress of all times. My crush. 😅😅
She is adorable!
Thanks.
daisie has kinda the same idea as tiktok algorithm
she kinda looks like arya stark
She lied.She&#39;s so fake
A girl gives a good speech. An audience is dead.
Wow thanks for the video. Maisie is so talented! I think it&#39;s always nice to hear that we should believe in ourselves and be humble at all times. Maisie&#39;s speech is really inspirational, especially to young people and myself.
This is the first speech I’ve listened to that held my attention from start to end 👏
very good job maisie love you so much thank you for helping changing the world
i am so happy for her!! she made it
Hope giver
I, I, Me, Me, My, My, I, I, Me, Me, My My ... Self Centered = FAILURE :p
King in the North
&quot;My second audition was for a show called Game Of Thrones&quot; *pause for audiences interactions&quot;<br>damn i feel bad for her
Maise, great talk, my question is - have you gone back to dancing or not? :)
OMG! SHE STEPPED OF THE CARPET! That was rebellious!
this crowd is dogshit, rip my boi maisie
This is so beautiful omg
Society smh.  I cant wait to die .
How is being born small a talent
Great ⚡🔥
WELL HELLO THERE ARYA STARK💜
Talent won&#39;t get you sh*t, being a compliant conformist is all you need to succeed in this world.
She is precious. Can’t say anything else (this coming from a person who talks way too much)
bet your also gud opps I meant talent to spoil.
You can prove yourself that such a beautiful girl like you as a webcam model doesn&#39;t need to be talented to succeed. So you can&#39;t be sure if it is your look and movement or talking, singing and acting that makes you famous. Being talented has nothing to do with being successful because there are at least bunch of talented people in the world who earn less than common and untalented people.
Gosh<br>Its so relatable I&#39;m trying to stop myself from swearing and saying &#39;like,like&#39; a lot
She is full of confidence
don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be rich.
TedX is the worst move Ted talks made.
I have seriously never seen GOT but I liked Maisie in a movie I watched on a plane in which she plays a girl with cancer who rescues a kid who thinks he has cancer or should be dead/dying.  On the plane they called the movie departures but I think it had another name.
Who else saw 3 ediots<br>Success k piche mt bhago
lmao, and of course I get a game of thrones ad. 😂
This Is the best ted talk i ever watch
Nagyszerű gondolatok és egy csodálatos kis hölgy, amit itt láttunk és hallotunk. Szerintem messze az egyik leg szebb színésznő, akit valaha láttam filmen. Kívánom hogy siker koronázza a törekvéseit, és minden célját.
Signed: a famous person
&quot;So I had to be someone else&quot;. Arya, GoT, 7x7 <br>Yep, girl - you are incredibly intelligent, talented,  yet &quot;strange and annoying&quot; :) No, I am joking.<br>I am so sorry that you came from such complicated family background. But God chose you to be loud and cheeky and to shout out the truth to this world - I have been so moved by your speech, Maisie.
she was so weird about it lol but shes bae
What do we say to the god of death?
All audiences must die like the audience was dead here
Maybe the crowd were quiet because <b>No One</b> was there
I don&#39;t know what the audience was responding to throughout the video or clapping for at the end, I saw no one...
No one else could have been Arya Stark. No one.
You are my favourite Arya. You are so relatable and inspiring.
this is brilliant
I&#39;ve always thought that I&#39;m not good enough just because I&#39;m not able to study in famous universities but this Ted talk really gave me the hope and now I&#39;ve decided to dream big.
Why is the audience so boring?🥺

One of the best ted talks I&#39;ve seen! &lt;3
Age: 23<br>Looks: 14<br>Clothes: 70
This was really cringy as I feel like she was trying to be funny a little bit. However the audience didn&#39;t find her funny and it seemed weird.
The audience was quiet bcoz the audience was thinking that was she playing the game of faces with them?
the audience needa to do better
Despite being so young, she is way more smarter and genuine than most of the so called billionaires in the world today!🙂
That was beautiful 💓
does anyone know that TED talk audiences usually dont have a mic? That might be why you barely hear anyone.
How come I didn&#39;t notice the silent audience like you all did. I guess I was so focused on her message
inspiring
wtf what a boring crowd.
The audience was more dead than katara’s mom
그 그랑삼국 광고찍은 코빅 개그맨 닮았네
Super talent elle sait faire la brouette ??
shes not the one to give this talk massive fail.
Maisie: Jokes <br>Audience: Not today
What a dead audience
I clicked for Maisie Williams.
Audience here is as colder than the north side of the wall.
Most of the presentation felt completely irrelevant to the takeaway point, I don&#39;t feel like I learned anything.
One day I will be speaker at Ted Talks!
VALAR MORGULIS
She looks like a really young grandma.
She is good.
What a rude audience.. Love her so much, I feel bad seeing that lack of passion from the audience
Die heart fan ❤❤❤
sabrina
the kind of talk some celebrities in my country should be listening to
That was awesome, I love her
Thanks.  I enjoyed every minute of this talk. She drew me in and I found myself smiling throughout the talk.  I will strive to be talented.   At the end of the day, if you don&#39;t make it, you have made it!  What is more rewarding than embellishing oneself into a better you?
She has to opportunity to tell us this because she is famous.
Love you, Maisie.  Keep up the good work.  &#39;Finally a girl knows she is someone&#39;
Well done, just a Stunning Speech, she&#39;s 22 only.<br>Beautiful and Gorgeous
I have tears in my eyes. She is so nice so good at this. I will follow my dream.
How about, strive to be intelligent on the topics you proclaim to the world. That applies to playing a character as well as activism and business. <br>There are many talented liars. There are many famous liars.<br>There are many talented famous liars.<br>When your character portrayal, activism, or business doesn&#39;t live up to scrutiny, that&#39;s when you&#39;ve lost.
her face alike arya stark
Your so much more then the sum of your qualifications. Thank you for this amazing talk.
Literally the apt recommendation at the right time 😄😄😁
Arya! Maná taí kitdár sakk dóst bót... I love your character in game of thrones.
She never trained to be an actor yet became one beating others who might be training hard for years. That just shows how important luck and talent is.
&quot;Don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be talented | Maisie Williams&quot;<br>Well, we all know she is NOT friends with the Car Dash Ians
Strive for a new hair stylist
A girl is Arya stark of winterfell🔥🔥🔥
I couldn&#39;t see the audience <br>Plot twist it was just a set
Who cares about the audience? If they were there or not?  Massie you are power!!! Keep on going girl!!!
I want my daughter to be like Arya Stark
Oof. Tough crowd.
I don&#39;t know who she is, but somehow I figured out she had a british accent idk why
Strive to go on an adventure and find where your heart is. And you will never have to strive again for talent or for anything else.
why would a young actoress with little experience and achieved very very little talk about this .
Wow shes annoying...
&quot;My grubby knees and crooked teeth were not on the list of requirements for becoming professional dancer. But at that time (Age 10), I was just too young and naive to feel inadequate. I didn&#39;t care.&quot;
She looks like a hand-puppet
90% why the iOS app was so popular was her money and fame. “Talent“ wouldn‘t have done much on its own.<br>So don‘t rely on talent. Be smart, be brave and work hard. And most of all, meet the right people.
I would be excited but I already figures that I don&#39;t want to be famous, rather have my project be known.
Nice cutely
Love Maisie Williams!
dont try to be rich, stop being poor. Make sense now
I was apart of a club that happened every Saturday, that years later, I realised was an agency. I enjoyed acting but wasn&#39;t going anywhere. I enjoyed getting into character, becoming someone who&#39;s not self conscious, who&#39;s actually strong, powerful, etc. The only thing that kept me back was my own voice. It didn&#39;t change in tone(the emotion in your voice) due to the simple fact that I hate my voice because I was bullied as a child and I still hate my voice years later. So my dreams of becoming a singer and my dreams of becoming an actor went out the window with the amount of rejections I got. I wanted to become a dancer but I am self conscious what other people think.
or strive to be lucky like a vast vast majority of successful people?
A GIRL HAS SPOKEN
I thought there is no audience here but it wasn’t, absolutely she is amazing
She reminds me the fairy from 16 wisher with debby rian
Nightslayer🗡️
So, here I am found a Stark who wanna became &quot;No One&quot; and here she just explain who she is and her list is now full of audience. so just get ready people
but I wonder if sleeping with a big guy in the industry in order to give her the GOT part is considered striving..well  maybe it is to some level.
I am inspired!
Gosh she should keep her GoT hairstylist by her side at all times but great speech indeed!
Finally a girl is no one.
Isn&#39;t talent an inherited base level or having a &quot;nack&quot; for something? You can&#39;t increase talent. Not striving to be famous but striving to improve your capabilities or skills makes sense though.
Thanks for your inspiring speech!
Some masterpiece are so unfamous....
Y&#39;all idiots don&#39;t understand sound mixing.
I don&#39;t care about being famous. Valar morghulis anyway.
I strive to get high for now, but I&#39;ll think about it Maisie.
Things famous people say
no offense, but she also strives to dress weirdly
is there any audience or not. WTF is wrong with this dead army.
Ted Hamare voids me hi hai Kuch chiz jis se koi majburi Ka fayda uthata hai. No2 bharta hu.
When Filming a TEDx Talk: never expose your image using only your monitor (check it on a waveform), double check your focus using focus peaking (again don&#39;t just trust the monitor), work with the lighting designer to ensure the lighting looks solid in camera, and when filming in a Raw or flat profile, use a chip chart to assist the colorist in post.
That’s seriously amazing!!!
Actors and models telling you to be talented while their succes is based on luck and standing out in crucial moments or in general.
Facts
Then there are those talented people that never got to be famous
Which the name of app
I like the fact that shes nervous, despite of her being famous with a great career.. That shows being human to me :)
I wish to meet you one day.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=981">16:21</a> minutes of no one talking, yet it has 157k likes ! WOW ! A boy is impressed....
Smart gul..
𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗱?
She is an incredible actress who is brimming with fascinating and inspiring emotions!
Where is the subtitles on russian? autor, its bad
Isn&#39;t talent something that you cannot learn?
I love her so much!
she played ashildr in Doctor Who
I don&#39;t think the audience is dead. They&#39;ve probably adjusted the sound so you don&#39;t hear people laughing and talking while she&#39;s giving the speech. Why would anyone think the audience is dead?
i dont want to be better than other people, i want to be better than myself
a girl has no name, <br>the audience has no soul
♥️♥️♥️
I don&#39;t have no qualms with the audience not obviously responded to her speech -- it makes it more understandable.
Well don&#39;t just watch Tedx .do something with your life.
This was a beautiful speech and was beautifully given.
I think so She was in Game of Thrones as a Arya Stark. Am I right¿
Today only finishED all GOT episodes.
Just get brave enough to start making my REAL DREAM come true !✨✨🙌🏼<br>Always wanted to become a singer 😌🎤<br>And now I&#39;m making covers here on my channel 🎤🎶<br>Please check them out ✨<br>It would mean a LOT for me 💓
Why is she looking like Anabelle?
Someone once said “she looks like a young grandma”
A girl is good at talking
I say strive to be you above all
This is so moving, the last few sentences gave me goosebumps!!
Funny to see that many many famous and talented people had parents who believed in their dreams no matter their age
My favorite ❤
OMG SHE LOOKS LIKE SUSAN FROM SUMMER CAMP ISLAND🏝️🧚‍♀️
Im also 13 year old but my mom and dad do not allow me to go on dance field but i dance good allo of my relatives always advice me to go in dance field
Such wise words tho. Really inspirational
A girl is having a TED talk<br><br><br><br><br>Wtf
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=870">14:30</a> - &quot;i hope to create a space where people can post their awe in creativity rather than what car they are driving and whether or not they bought it in cash or on finance&quot;. Great Speech!
&quot;Arya stark&quot;... 💖💖💖
You can do anything if you can speak English.. <br>Yes it is..
She looks just as same as the Anabella doll from conjuring😂😂
the audience was all men and they didnt laugh cuz they aint wanna simp
Dead audience 🙉😒
Can you translate it to Vietnamese? plss. Omg I really like this title.
why does she make me think of emma watson? XD
m williams and emilia clarke are the only female actress i like out there..you can see how humble they are...they dont play it..they truly are
Loved your speech Maisie &lt;3
Reading the comment about those audience is so fun. <br>I love the speech and her play in GOT
she is great but her stylist needs to be fired
she has no talent she has the face of a frog WTF am i missing
She looks like arya stark from got
That;s what a famous person would say.
SHE REMINDS ME OF LUNA LOVEGOOD ASDKLJKASD
Truly right, I can just see it in the title, the question is that talent not all of us can see between insecurities. Thank you, you are really just real.
Wonderful Girl !
You were lucky to be chosen as arya stark, not everyone is so much lucky in this world. Many people have dreams and capable of doing hardworking. But everyone not chosen. Accept it
&quot;Don&#39;t strive to be famous , strive to be talented&quot; <br>Tiktokers are punching the air rn
The audience made me damn sad :(
Booooo urns. Boooo urns.
DOCTOR WHO OMG
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=592">9:52</a>: a joke- she  tries to get the audience laughter-but in vain<br>what a terrible audience
a girl is not famous, a girl is no one
If only Benioff and Weiss took this advice....
My lifelong dream is to become an actress but the thing is I have neither the talent nor the support to achieve my dreams. It makes me really sad because this has been a dream for me since I was really really young. I was a dancer from the age of 7 to 12, giving me some experience in performing arts but I have stage fright so that whenever I have to present in front of a large group I get shaky and I talk really fast. I know I do it but I can&#39;t stop myself, and I know this because I have tried to one too many times. I worry that everybody is judging me and though I tell myself not to care, it affects my performance very severely. Hailing from an Asian family, my parents want me to become a doctor but I don&#39;t have as much passion for science or medicine as I do for performing arts. I feel so beat up thinking of all the qualifications I don&#39;t have and skills that I lack to make my dream come true and I truly, honestly hope that I will, one day, be able to look back at this comment and say that I&#39;ve done it.
Someone tell the one who&#39;s giving the advice &quot;you&#39;re not famous enough to give such advice&quot;
British crowds don&#39;t have the urge to whoop - sorry Atlantic cousins
You missed telling you are a good orator too
The problem is most of us never find that thing that gives us that emotion<br> that thing that we love so much that we forget all the laziness and can pursue it like a madman
Wow the audience were so bad. Takes balls to keep giving it 100 per cent when you&#39;re not getting feedback.
very bad
Average actress at best.
&quot;We just shot season 8 which is predicted to smash records we smashed before&quot;<br><br><br>Broke the record of the world&#39;s biggest disappointment<br><br><br><b>after me</b>
Obvious speach
if SHE were the symbol for a Talented person;<br><br>Then I&#39;m the best Lawyer there is on this planet.
I thought the audience were all corpses or mannequins or something until the applause at the end. Was there just no microphone to pick up response or were they THAT silent?
The reason the audience is so quiet is the mike levels and placement. It&#39;s like that in a lot of TED talks. There have been actual comedians like Reggie Watts doing their thing on TED and you can barely hear laughter.
Loved this speech. Maisie is so inspiring and has such a great sense of humour. &lt;3 &lt;3
Unbelievable Truly… She is so inspirational
And we are listening all these things from a 23 year old girl who hasnt been properly introduced to life yet...i am gonna wait for game of thrones series to end and see how you get work after that..you cant even make the crowds laugh for more than 2 times
She’s a humble and down to earth person who doesn’t pretend to be anything she’s not. One of the best TED Talks I’ve ever seen 👏
You&#39;re not talented
中国人的自信用祖国华夏中华龙的传人强汉盛唐日本科技以及人工智能脑控武器宗教传播肮脏杂碎乱伦恐怖主义建立成功，所以以后不需要提供任何技术任何外交关系。
So to summarise this for Indians : Beta kaabil bano kaabil, kamyaabi toh saala jhak maar ke peeche aayegi.
Maravilhosa 💗💗
Thank you for being an inspiration. Such lovely words to hear. I would surely reflect this on my own.
Beautiful😍💓
I’m obsessed with her. She’s so great and her talk was amazing! 💕
The reason why people aren&#39;t laughing is because she isn&#39;t funny. Status doesn&#39;t equate to funny. She isn&#39;t relatable. iF tHe AudIeNcE wAs YoUnGeR..
She basically is Yoshikage Kira
How would she and her pink hair be legitimate to lecture anybody about anything at all?<br>An actor&#39;s task simply consists on learning and recitating some text written by someone else.<br>Instead of her, they had rather invited costumers, decoraters, technicians or even producers for instance.
You cannot strive to be talented. Talent is innate.
She is so pure
She could pass for a 16-year-old, but she has the maturity and confidence of a 26-year-old.
she&#39;s gonna be hella big in the future.
Is she from Harry Potter
hate this title. don&#39;t like all the comments about the audience.
daamn she is so sweet
You cant strive to be talented. You&#39;re born talented or u just not
Don&#39;t strive to tell us what to do, strive to mind your own business.
As much as she mentions most of her self doubts and insecurities, I&#39;m really glad she took that leap. She is honestly one of the characters to watch on game of thrones
&#39;Don&#39;t strive to be famous.. strive to be No one. &#39;
talent is a myth, skill is reality and skill can be learned. there is nothing called by born talented its rumor guys.
Survivorship bias ?
Don&#39;t be famous, be no one
The most awkward audience ever
Life is not about being talented, its about luck. All the talent in the world won&#39;t do you if you are out of luck, but with enough luck you can do things even without a talent
Evrytime she smiled/laughed in the show I did too.. I&#39;d rewind to watch again too..
A huge young celeb is out here creating something of substance aside from beauty/makeup line (Rihanna excluded) !?? i HAVE to stan!
shoes......distracting...n hairs..lol
Arya stark...thats what many only know
The topic is misleading
Was fan of Arya Stark but after watching this also a fan of Maisie Williams🙋‍♀️
The audience isn&#39;t responding because it&#39;s thinking real deep.
Woow she is an inspiration to the millennial generation. Her work speaks for herself.
I&#39;m your fan
Dont strive for anything.
sorry but this was one of the worst TedTalks I&#39;ve ever seen. But nice promo tho<br>people who praise this have a horizon of a bread
I like it💕💕
<b>cough</b><br>Gggggod knooooows
This happens when you give speech in front of &#39;White walkers.&#39;
Dead crowd. Great speech.
Maisie: when I am going to get Billie Elliot<br>Audience laughs<br>Massie:I joke<br>Audience:Ohh
The noone girl?
Don&#39;t take it personally guys ;)
typically, this is the  type of BS come from someone is not properly educated but famous, the fame does not make their unrealistic and idealism speech more convincible, at least to any intelligent people.
I am neither famous nor talented
Badass
I did&#39;&#39;t ask for story of your life 7 minutes of video and I lerned nothing. Thumbs down...
Her British accent is so cute.
so basicaly Maisie boasting about her achievements for quarter of an hour? what a nothing talk lmaaoo no wonder the crowd were dead xDD
Excellent speech 👍🏼👌🏽
I feel like you can tell that she&#39;s an actress just by watching this.
pls invite hodor.
I want to be like her when I grow up
well,,, is that a wig or something...?
I&#39;ve loved watching you grow and conquer Maisie!  Congratulations from start to forever!  You&#39;re a true talent with a beautiful heart.  Thank you. 💜
Beautiful and touching
I think I&#39;m being pretentious here commenting without watching the video, but, for God&#39;s sake girl, no one knew that before you told us. They need to preserve the quality before quantity. All these videos are making good ones harder to find.
Am I the only one who cried?it really touched me
hi Lexi
مين سمع كلمة damn it .....تمام
&quot;I have never had an end goal and its  working out so far&quot; I hope I can say this, convincingly, to my interviewer someday
She has an outstanding courageous character, hope her business will fly, her idea matches our start-up idea, who knows, maybe a potential partner in the future, will be honored.
A girl can be anyone
this girl doesnt know the defintion of talent
Easy to say when you have had everything handed to you on a silver platter. Imagine if you weren&#39;t hugely lucky and didn&#39;t get the GOT gig? You would be a complete nobody right now. Let that sink in. You are out of touch and untalented. You just got very very lucky.
Love you as now
Yeah about that talent... didn&#39;t feel it, especially in the later seasons.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=103">1:43</a> <b>silence</b> yikes feel bad she deserved better
looks like someone just watched 3 idiots
കിടു സ്പീച്ച്...
&quot;Oh I&#39;m so humble, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m up here&quot;
Great speech massie, you never cease to amaze me
she has bad launguage
God The start was so rough i would have cried and left the stage<br>she deserved better audience
I m fan of the Arya Stark
Good talk and i love how modest she is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=570">9:30</a> Yeah right...
The last few minutes really touch my heart... ugh maisie i love u
Fair play maisie you know what it&#39;s all about
I watched the whole video because of her accent!
So touching to see her revealing what her life was like. The first time I saw her was in Doctor Who as Ashildr. I didn&#39;t know she was famous then, but I knew I liked her.<br>I hope she gets to be Billy Elliot one day.
and once again she faces the army of the dead.
i guess the reason audience didnt respond despite her beautiful speech was that she has no profession on science or politics like other people do. she is still very young and unexperienced
If I would have been there you&#39;d have heard my laugh every 10 seconds.<br><br><b>The speech was amazing but the audience was dead like what was wrong with them?</b>
Sounds pathetic. Nothing special
This talk is an inspiration, thank you!
Who is Billy Elliot 🤔?
but i need to make money
As for me she doesn&#39;t realise how much opportunities she had in comparison with other people which in other places
This audience is pretty lame
how can you strive for something thats not in your control? Talent is outside our control
Very dramatic speech...
Man, I&#39;d prefer having a dead audience - means I can talk freely without getting interrupted by laughter.
Thank you.
she as Arya is actually the leading character in GoT, not Danaerys.
She did so good. She just kept on doing and didnt lose her track so. The audience is a tough one but she probably knew that people will see this online so at least her fans will be able to enjoy it
why isn&#39;t the audience laughing??
said the famous person
So, why are you just profiting from the fact you&#39;re famous?
“...rather than what car they are driving.”    <b>stars in a car advert</b>
:Here is a speech about me. Thank you for listening&quot;. hahaha
being famous would be too scary tbh
bad audience
WTF with those hairs Maisie..??
the kardashians are talented at making themselves famous/infamous
Awesome talk. I&#39;m always super impressed by people who can do public speaking this well. audience sucked
The Audience probabely are kardashian fans!
&quot;my second audition was for a show called Game of Thrones..&quot;. You can really hear it in her voice cracking a bit and her taking a break not to cry was really emotional. Sweet girl. You made it! :)
Dead audience ?
strive to look like a square
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=708">11:48</a> &quot;Actors are only as good as their writers.&quot;  -- Priceless
A girl gives a Ted talk about striving to be No One.
i am impressed!!<br>for sure a lot great acting is to be seen from you :)
RUS subs pls ;c
Well done Maisie,  your very brave, public live speaking..to an audience like that....think you&#39;re great*
I want to see &quot;Noman Ali Khan&quot; in TED Talks.
Don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be talented.<br>and do whatever it takes, to protect it.<br>by any means necessary.
her stylist should be fired
If you saw the unedited version, you would probably understand why the audience is the way they are. I was in that audience. She lost her way, she forgot her lines, she stopped speaking on several occasions, staring anxiously at the floor (they have been edited out). It was uncomfortable to watch. Compared to previous speakers that day, her delivery was the most &quot;scripted&quot; and not up to the hype. Amazing how an edited versions flips the tables...
Yes, let&#39;s all listen to a 22-year-old who knows nothing about the real world while she lectures us on how to live...
Title:D<br>Miss one movie... Child of pure talent.....
I loved the speech it was flawless!!, but the audience is horrible
Actress revealing her real life! Awesome!👌 its just inspiring.😀
I completely agree with musicians are only as good as their producers.
yeee
She should have worn her other face, the girl is no one, instead of Maisie willians cause the COLD AUDIENCE proved WINTER IS HERE.
So basically Arya Stark ended up developing smartphone apps. Interesting turn of events.
Well she failed in doing what she preaches
She is wasting her time speaking for these people. Very boring audience!
That title should be given to every youtuber, <br><br>Talented hacks that are famouse for being shallow
just an openion i do not think she is qualified to give a lecture
I don&#39;t know how YouTube suggested me just when i was thinking &quot;when will i be famous?&quot;<br>I am mind blown.
I love you Massie.
Love u arya stark❤( maisie) u did well &amp; I really like ur acting 😍😍😍😍
I thought a well offer white woman with nothing to say was bad but no humor is the worse
Her accent 🔥
I guess the audience were broke. Who else would come for a Ted show?
Dont strive to be famous<br>.....because you are no one
she&#39;s so nice.
Wow . she’s brilliant
Great job
From a poor family to killing the night king, what a story!
Excelente video grasias Pedro x desde Miami
Arya, my love
This girl is so sympathetic and adorable and she&#39;s a brilliant actress, yet she has been so insecure about her appearance and her capabilities in the past, perhaps like all of us and at the end it turns out that all of it is a nonsense.
Oh my queen excellent speech
Thank you 🙏🏻 I’m a singer and a songwriter, currently recording my songs 🥳 Consider checking out and subscribing to my YouTube Channel ❤️ Follow your dreams
wow that&#39;s a really bad outfit
Her audience were Walder Frey&#39;s army
Maisie its really good  speech specially 👊 line
She had a fight on tv
Have Isaac Hempstead Wright.
A girl speaks well !
No comments will help you to learn so go check it out the video.
Every time i see maisie&#39;s face i smile. Just one of those happy, always looks excited kind of people.
You are the best girl with confident I ever see
لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله <br>Laa ilaaha illallaahu Muhammadur rasoolullah<br>There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah<br>♥💜💙💚💛❤♥💜💙💚💛❤
Gd
the only one laughing among the audience is John Snow
iF this girl is sincere about her project, i tend to be worry about her. and consequently i get to the idea that many here could be entertainment industry&#39;s trolls or some lout conspiraty activists who refuse  refuse to give her any chance. it&#39;s taking a ride on the dark side.
guys i was there and the audience was really loud but they had to cover it up because you wouldnt be able to hear maise :)
do you know who told her to give this ted talk?<br><br><br><br><br>no one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=806">13:26</a> one man  ??
I dont have anything in particular against Maisie Williams, but it is quite cringing to see her trying to teach people about talent and what to strive for? She is not particular talented herself, with acting skills being average at best. She never had to &quot;strive for&quot; anything as she got everything served on a plate by simply having an apperance fitting for the Arya-character. Since then no serious acting jobs at at except for a few that merely fed of her GOT-fame that will fade away withing 2 years at most.
most people stay in the round red carpet when they speak, she stepped out...
well the truth is that nobody cares if you are talented or not, everyone is selfish.
am i the only one who first thought she had cancer?<br>rofl
I think the ones who disliked the video are just not convinced of Arya killing the Night King
Arya stark......?seriously?
Damn!  she is adorable ♥️♥️
I think the audience doesn&#39;t understand English..😒😒
blaaah blaaaaaaahh
Why are you all complaining about the poor audience? You, from your computer or smartphone, are audience too.
I admire Maisie’s efforts in this speech. She tried a lot to prevent her from unprofessional behaviors un public speaking for better experiences of the audiences. Her courage that leads her to success is invaluable and inspired me a lot. Thank you Maisie as an inspiration for the youth.
Her way of approach is totally soo good. Margaret constance Williams (Maisie Williams)  is a pretty good speaker. I didn&#39;t know why there was no response from the audience, I guess they didn&#39;t had the feelings to response for the sense of humour, this indicates that , they may be the dead armies.
The Sitting Dead
What a dead crowd! 🙆🏿‍♀️
Completely agree
the audience were probably all boomers they only laughed at her divorce joke
You can tell she doesn&#39;t read.  xD
I loved what she said  ,amazing speech .
Maise Williams: Maise Williams
Life advice from a kid under 20...  GoT  made her,  end of story,  luck out getting a good roll in a movie,  become rich and famous, then tell people now to give up on their goals.  If GoT would have bomd shed be a noone still.  Now that your rich and famous are u goin to follow your dreams and become a dancer? prob not, ur ganna chase the $$
She famous because of GOT, but loved her performance on Doctor Who - the girl who never dies. The immortal Viking who meet the doctor in the end of the universe.
those audience are a waste of oxygen
But famous people make more money!!
GUYS THE LAUGHTER IS JUST HARD TO HEAR, ITS THERE IF YOU LISTEN GODDAMN
i was (pleasantly) surprised to find that she is actually a skilled speaker. But then i remembered she was an actress.
The title makes no sense.
Hmm last Ted talk when I glimpsed to the comment section everyone was talking about the crowd but not about the speech. SURELY that was a one time thing. Nope, everyone is talking about the crowd here. Great.
Wise words. I&#39;ve just become a fan.
Omg this audience is so dead wtf
It is awesome
I like this video very much Maisie Williams is very beautiful girl she have right not the fame is important strive to be talented not to be famos and she is right i like very much everytging she tell here I Love Maisie Williams Very Much not only because is great actress i love her very much like person because she is very good person love the nature the animale Maisie make charity work donațions help other peoples help the dolphind make Daisie she Always is sou kind sweet is open mind she is smart Always i wanna suport help Maisie whit everytging she need Always i wanna love Maisie Whit All My Heart and i wish very much meet Maisie Williams in person spend magic time whit her give her my gifts music bax flowers ciocolate hug her tell her i like Arya Stark very much tell her how much i admire i respect and i Love her be whit Maisie is all the most i wish new i am from Romania

Esta chido el Pug
I admire her success because of her talent and dedication. Most of which doesn&#39;t not come from her look.
Valar morghulis
&quot;except for how i felt on the inside. i had big dreams&quot;......*sigh* + cringe = oh another one is it?
Strive to be talented? You mean skilled?
&quot;refuse to hold yourself back&quot; that hit me pretty hard!
-Valar Morghulis<br>-Valar Dohaeris
I&#39;d like to speak one day in that stage and convince the world wide my filler expression
Kim Kardashian’s begs to differ.
she&#39;s so damn cute
This crown his so dead what should we tell the dead people then
Great speech talented girl .. go forward . Great speech ever ..
Yes, well, I&#39;d rather be remembered for doing something in a paper than go for quick fame. I don&#39;t like the idea of fame because it&#39;s an assault to the soul.  Most of us make small gains during our lifetime and are rewarded with family and friends.  To be interrupted for fame is annoying.
i still think of her as a child
Cramming
very motivating
This is how they use the youth to hunt other youths before they are able to understand WHY the qualifications dont matter, that that means there is something fundamentally wrong with the system, and that these people are setup to lead other people following them to their death or worse, shame on you.
Collaboration/spyware apps, what could go wrong.
The title makes no sense.. Talent is something innate...  You are born with it.. Title should have been Hard work beats talent any day.
Best video
this is the most important and inspiring speech i&#39;ve ever listened!
she&#39;s so humble
&quot;Don&#39;t strive to be famous&quot; a person who is famous lol<br>&quot;Beauty is not that important&quot; someone that is beautiful<br>&quot;Money is not everything&quot; someone who&#39;s rich<br>I could go on, but you get the point.
Its probably the Kim Jong Un outfit.
It must be hard to give your speech in this silence, I watched lots of Ted Talks performance and people usually applaud many times during a speech. I feel myself pity about Maisie.
She is love😍
Wow she has a good way of dealing with her emotions I just punch a pillow
Few will see this comment but, the audience is not dead or bored, its just there is only one mic, the one she is using which means it is very hard almost impossible to hear the crowd laugh or applaud if they aren&#39;t very loud...
how long do strive for talent until i get it?
I thought she was Rogerina from the I want to break free music video in the thumbnail
The audience isn&#39;t dead, the microphone just didn&#39;t pick it up.
Omg.... I love her she&#39;s so relatable 😢, but the audience wasn&#39;t helping matters at all😂
Being lucky is also important
heres the problem though, not EVERYONE can be IN game of thrones playing YOUR part. Its just the reality of life. NOt everyone can be successful, its just the way it is and a bit of luck and a lot of talent. Theres people that try and try and try , but they MIGHT only get so far, some might try 3 times and get to the height of greatness. Its just the way it is in life. Just enjoy yourself and be the best you can be. There&#39;s nothing much else you can do :)
the north remembers 🐺
All right, my respect for Maisie just went up quite a bit. It takes guts to hold a quarer hour long public speech or lecture. Mad respect, girl. Good luck.
Talent is natural. Natural. It’s just something you’re born with. I prefer hard work. I was never naturally good at everything, so I practiced. Maybe once a week? Maybe each day? I don’t know. But I practiced and got better
Dream, it was money that we just didn&#39;t have....Thats more than half the world for u.
Maybe the audience was too focused listening to her? Maisie&#39;s speech was perfect and inspiring. 💟
the jokes landed flat, couldn&#39;t tell if they were supposed to be funny or not. kinda get the silent audience
On purpose!
Thank you very much guys. May God bless you, your families, your channel and all of your subscribers. And please continue inspiring us. Thank you very much guys.
What a terrible audience. I thought she did well, but the crowd was just daggers and sneers.
You thought you were a dancer? Silly boy!
You really are perfect
41bis per chi l&#39;ha vestita
You say this because you are famous.
Why is Maisie so cute help............................
&quot; No one talk &quot;<br>&quot; No one clab &quot;
I guess the audience think she is Cersei.
Did you know? Its strange...<br>You are watching NO ONE at the same time you are watching someone...
I just spent 16 minutes watching NO ONE..
shes peng i swear
Thank you for last words
Is she speaking to the dead?
Not Today
please be the next bill gates
She is much uglier than I remember
Omg she is arya stark in the game pf thrones😮😳
ScchutUp!!❤️❤️❤️
Honestly the crowd were such dead beats
Im coming here, to learn English Language. Thank you<br><br>From indonesian
I was knowing that i couldnt remember her Word after Speech but still i Focus on her for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=981">16:21</a>sec ,More than My collage subjects <br>😜😜😍💓🙏
CRINGE!!!
😍😍😍<br>Arya Stark
Is so humble, talented, charming, shining girl♥️
Maisie te amo 🤗👏😬
What an inspiring soul she is, I am a huge fan of her work. Even though she has become famous at such a young age, she still seems to dealing with it humbly and down to earth. I wish her all the best in whatever she pursues in her future.
man, id like to slap everyone in the crowd
I Love Her Chuck Taylor&#39;s, Chuck Taylor&#39;s Are Followers Of Great People.
Since when does an egocentric monologue qualify as a TED talk?
Wow! This is so inspiring.
Wow! This is so inspiring.
I love Maisie and her performance in GOT, but man I cringe a bit at the title..
Im so happy to watched your inspiring your video  and im your big fan . god bless you ,
Sob stories nonsense and drivel.
This practice talk is the most amazing and interesting story in Ted talk! Now let the audience in!
If your doing it for clout and money , that&#39;s fine but know you(most of you) WONT be happy for long. They say find the things in life that make you happy. A lot of people think that clout/ money is the answer when some of them find out they&#39;re wrong. My goal is to be a big name in the fashion modeling, acting, fashion, and music industry Worldwide. That fame &amp; money is a bonus for me. I love what I do man, money only allows me to grow in those departments and to give to others who don&#39;t even get the chance to do what I&#39;m doing. Been at it for 3 years , and I can&#39;t wait to be at the top of my game. Stay motivated to do what you LOVE! ❤
a silenced crowd doesnt mean a dead crowd. it could be really interesting or you just don&#39;t hear the audio of the people...
love ya, Maisie
That audience were so non-reactive, awful
I Didn&#39;t know one hit TV show qualified someone to talk about something so deep.
thank you so much maisie for everything you&#39;ve done
Who says being famous isn&#39;t a talent, It is world&#39;s most popular talent.
Woah! She looks like Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter.
Guess Maisie decided to be neither.
God, the delivery is so painful to watch. Good thing she&#39;s not an actor or something
This speech really made me gain respect for Maisie. So engaging and intellectual.
Good girl
TL&#39;DR <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=956">15:56</a>
Master Class Maisie ! From France with luv ♥
Surely they muted most the audience or made it quiet. No way would a whole crowd be so silent lol I feel so angry at them if so 😂
This is Game of thrones season 9😂😂😂
OMG it&#39;s Arya Stark😀
Someone got lucky
she is so charming
Its sad that this is even needs to be stated.... The world we live in. I didn&#39;t even bother to watch it.
What kind of audience are they? 😑
audience ???
Either Audiences are Lannisters<br>Or they&#39;re angry because she&#39;s addressing herself as Maisie Williams not as Arya Stark
she legit looks like joffrey in the thumbnail
I just love her
what&#39;s up with the audience? maybe the mic didn&#39;t catch it
&quot;We&#39;ve recently finished shooting our 8th and finale season, which is already predicted to smash records that we&#39;ve previously broken&quot;<br><br><b>CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM THEME INTENSIFIES</b>
I came to the comments as soon as she made her first joke and there wasnt even the sound of marching from the dead army and was not disappointed
Man! I’d get up on the stage and just give her a hug and cheer for her. She’s so sweet 🥰 GOD I just want to meet her so much😫 I think about her everyday...not joking,so sorry to Maisie’s boyfriend hehe 😜
She is talking with No one&#39;s.
An absolutely lovely human being. InCREDIble speech.
The audience is soo emotional less
What a pathetic audience out there...
A lot of Dead army comment on the line
Strive to know God and the good news.
Got a GoT commercial
Not even a single line which motivate me😁😆
The audience is dead, is dead dead dead
Her time is over. She could’ve had a longer time in the spot light if she kept her mouth closed and looked pretty.
I love you
Maisie: So when are you guys gonna respond to anything i say!??<br>Audience : &quot;Not Today!!&quot;
They must have uploaded the wrong video this is probably just her practicing cause its TOO quiet
I wish I was there so I can tell those people how dead they are.
Damn, I love this girl.
The advance was dead because they didn&#39;t want to be alive and not hear her... Very inspirational and motivating  thanks for sharing
What a dead audience... She was hilarious
Well correct me if I&#39;m wrong but isn&#39;t a talent something that can&#39;t be teached/learned? I mean you can get good at stuff with practice. But if you have a talent for something, it&#39;s just there, even before you start practicing? &quot;natural aptitude or skill&quot; it says on the dictionary.
My crush sounds and looks somewhat like her,  and lives in Manchester!!
Lmao she only got into acting bc she didn&#39;t want to fo to farm with school
Tough crowd.
I&#39;m hoping that this TED was given in Siberia. Or, the audience reaction just did not come through. <br><br><br>Maisie rocks! Such a talented young lady and seriously invested in the betterment of others that could use a girl with powerful gifts. I wish you luck in the wars to come. Peace,
Could they have at least woke the audience up and told all the grandapa&#39;s and grama&#39;s to wake up... good lord, this was a god talk.
the speech shows us the real face of maise williams the better face
Was she giving the speech to an empty room or the army of the dead, woow. Very good speech with a lot of confidence. Well done Maisie.
Her outfit is nice
Says the most famous girl in the whole west
Loved the talk, shows that anyone with a dream can succeed!
OMG the audience is dead here ! Hmm
I know her from Game Of Thrones
The audience were not convinced about her story, they thought she still lack the experience for her to preach in front of them like that. I feel sorry for Aria, the girl who killed the Night King.
bro she paused for applause and no one clapped I AM GENUINELY SHOCKED I don&#39;t even watch GoT and I would&#39;ve been psyched to see her
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=750">12:30</a> lady gaga impression killed me 😂
What a seriously dead and intimidating crowd she had there 😥
💝💝
she&#39;s got it all 💝
This crowd is horrible
She&#39;s Aria in real life too
Not today
What a dead audience.
Did she watch the movie &quot;3 IDIOTS&quot; ?
I think what Williams wanted to say was that we should look on what we can change in ourselves rather than looking on how we can change our surroundings or how people see us.
Ossm
hey, you are my favourite character on GOT. Thanks for sharing, hope to meet you one day to learn the arts of the faceless men
I feel like a lot of tedtalks are just... the speakers giving us a bio of their lives and recounting how they got to where they are but not really hitting the topic the title suggests headon...
Shut up you can&#39;t say that when you&#39;re famous already.
Well from your audience watching online Maisie I applaud you, you inspire me daily, both as yourself &amp; Arya.
you&#39;re not talented tho, Maisie
She deserve an academy award for game of thrones AND another one for enduring this awkward audience!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=214">3:34</a> damn i never thought someones hands could shake that much
The audience is so dead I am really amazed she kept it together for this talk, fair play to her.
thank you for motivation
Another one for audience!
She Right
Awesome speech...
Tskkk I am here for Arya Stark
Obviously rehearsed the (wait for laughter) after each quip but the pauses proved unnecessary.
She gave a damn speech....Her emotions and the way she spoke expressed everything way beyond words
good job
im not here :)

I’m glad the audience is restrained. This is a conference, not a comedy chat show.
A girl cannot make the audience laugh
That was so strong :&#39;(
I have never clicked so fkn fast

THIS WHAT YOU GET FOR HAVING MANY FACES , NO REACTION WHEN WE SEE YOUR FACE
AINT NOBODY IN THAT CROWD
is the audience okay? I personally thoroughly enjoyed this speech
<b>The kardashians have left chat</b>
Watching them in GOT, I feel I am connected to the show. And knowing that it is all over, I feel something is missing !
💓
As another person commented it could be true the Mic just didn’t pick up the audiences reaction. If this is true no offense. Great job on the speech— cheers!
She did amazingly smashing despite the sleepy audience. Who picks these audiences are they even listening. Lol
🎬
Thank you for this inspiring TED talk.
Most watched ted talk, boring-iest live audience.
I&#39;d feel insulted to be in front of such a dead crowd.
this audience  sucks........
Good conference ! Maisie Williams is a pretty good actress and seems to be an intelligent woman ... She&#39;s brilliant ! <br>(Sorry, I&#39;m french  ...)
💜💜
<b>wow</b>
She&#39;s right about good writers. She needs one.
Not offering an applause for that Game of Thrones moment was absolutely terrible! Bad listeners!
hahaha that bit about Lady Gaga was hilarious.... why is no one laughing.... ugh
Comments in this section are gold 😂😂😂
Just focus your eye to her and you&#39;ll start to see her seems floatin
Just focus your eye to her and you&#39;ll start to see her seems floatin
&quot;Maisie is an actress, an entrepreneur, and an activist. Yet to this day, she has no formal qualifications to her name.&quot; -- Survivor-ship Bias
Tremendous! Maisie you  were marvellous with such a dysfunctional audience, come to Canada would love to hear you speak (Canadiana are very polite lol) Don&#39;t change, remember your roots, you have only just begun.
Audience was from Mars.
Is there an audience or...
Is dead quietness and the inability to laugh at jokes a requirement for attending Ted talks?
Ugh I bet that “crowd” smelt proper dead
Strive to be talented? Oh, I thought that talent is innate!
Maise... Arya start u r  always be an role model for me
She&#39;s smart she&#39;s going to be richer than all of the cast of GoT combined.
This girl is special.
Are the audience like 10 miles away or somethin
I finally decided to click on this video because i liked her outfit haha
So she is basically marketing her app. and humble-bragging for 16 mins. GREAT, THANKS YOUTUBE!!!
Must be so awkward getting such poor reactions from the audience after strings of efforts. Glad she finished it nicely in such a confident manner.
Apart from the dead audience 😅it was an Honest Talk ... well said !
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=606">10:06</a> I hear White walkers laugh
Pretty sure it was the same guy laughing every time!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Don&#39;t strive to be talented, strive to be happy.
There is no dead army in front of her because she already killed NIGHT KING. SO my visions say there is NOONE
Crowd isn&#39;t dead, is just that they&#39;re hearing and watching &quot;no one&quot;.
I think the audience is just in awe of seeing Arya Stark, stupified really.
A girl was not ready to become no-one. But she was ready to become someone else... Billy Elliot.
This was a very inspirational but that crowd sucked
I would bet that none one in that audience has ever scene GOT which is pretty is pretty sad would explain their lack of enthusiasm for this talk.
I’m guessing the dislikes are for the audience?
It took me awhile to recognise Arya Stark . Weird hairdo
Plot twist: she is alone w/ camera man
I would wife Maisie
Dear Maisie , the North remembers.
A girl has a dead audience in front of her Because a girl is no one
I want to listen more
You are amazing. Thank you for being you!
The dothrakis attended her speech.
Y&#39;all are aware that the audience has just been muted right....? Lmfao
😂 why was I the only one laughing,
im proud of her !
Those big eyes. She is a very  talented, hard working, inspirational soul. God bless her.
I like to see her family tree
The only TedTalk I’ll voluntarily watch
that room was so  d e a d  the poor bean
She&#39;s amazing. The best person I know
The role of Arya, really made an impact on her.
Poor girl with this dead white walker audience
Listen to ted x.<br>Maisie has my shoes
Maisie 💖
Applause!
Imagine, from out of nowhere, The Hound suddenly stands up from the crowd and claps his hand while shouting “that’s my girl!!!” and the other crowds look frightened and forced to stand up and clap their hands as well 🤣
Yo this is amazing! Thank you
Daisy is such a great idea for an app - I work in a creative industry and there is so much abuse of power. Creators need to take back the power.
She has got some serious talent out there. Of dancing, acting and most certainly uplifting people&#39;s spirits through her words alone.
She did so good. Such a brave girl.
She deserved a much better audience. She was funny. It made me cringe that no one was laughing
I&#39;m not sure why people are posting so many negative comments about Maisies jokes. She&#39;s trying to keep it light and interesting. Engaging with her audience. She&#39;s not a stand up comedian.
wtf @ the audience
This girl is awesome! I can&#39;t believe her audience are mute!
Tough crowd
Strive to be talented says the actress who will probably never get another role outside of game of thrones.
I think this is probably the least interesting Ted Talk there has ever been.
I would’ve walk out if I ever spoke in front of a crowd like that!
And suddenly her dancing instructor in GOT got even cooler to me
I was so focused on her speech that I didn´t even mind the audience as everyone is saying. We need to stop seen the negative aspects on everything. It was a great speech and I enjoyed it!
ARYA STARK
Nice face
dare to dream big
this audience makes me want to kms
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=367">6:07</a> anyone misses the 1st sword of Bravos?
Si antes la amaba, ahora más! Es muy inspiradora. Desde muy pequeña a luchado por sus sueños y demuestra su valía con cada escalón que sube.
Really no one not even a sound 😑
Wtf that crowd pissed me off. Idg how they can be so deadddd like come on its maisie William&#39;s?? 🤦🏾‍♂️I felt so sorry for her and she did such a good job👍🏽
Ted’s audience is always so quiet, but I’ll still never stop feeling weird and embarrassed for the performers.
Read the book &quot;Grit: Passion and Perseverance&quot; and you&#39;ll find out how overrated talent is. Striving is the important part.
A girl has no audience
Is there an audience at all?
Thank you maisie. 💜
The only joke the audience laughed about was the relatable one, divorce 😂🤣
Whatever did the audience - it made  Maisie more convincing and inspiring!!
The thing is, I want to be talented and do stuff, but am more scared of the fame part. Scared of having too much attention, having my private life out there and all other stuff that influence famous people&#39;s lives for example - social media, it clearly can get you in to being depressed, it seems scary to me, but I want to do big things and be great at doing them.
Arya😍
I wish to be a faceless man and kill all of them in the audience for Arya!
A very beautiful speech and such confidence to speak it so truthfully and heart filled with such little engagement. This is a talk to be saved and shared.
amazing talk
What an amazing spirit you are, you are fiercely made. Continue with the great light your share upon others😄 to help them become a better version of themselves and reach deep for their full potential. Everyone have a gift it is up to us to let the world see it. You are beautiful Maisie..
The audience is effing TERRIBLE!!!!
I love Maisie Williams.
I love this girl, such a great personality behind the characters she plays. This crowd is so rubbish, yet she doesn&#39;t skip a beat, respect maisie
id smack up this audience maisie deserves a better audience
It’s so awkward because of how silent the crowd was, compared to what she was clearly excepted.
I love her but it was a little cringy
Good speech rehearsal , Maisie !
You made a team and built a social media and an ios app??? :o I want to work with you, my crush!  I am good at programming.
what a great ted talk one of the best =]
Aria is forever a badass in my book
Believe her.. words came from a one time wonder herself.
Seems like communicating to camera... Such dead audience 😒
No one is talking
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=707">11:47</a> Actors are not only as good as their writers.   You&#39;ve proven that Maisie in Season 8 of GoT.   You&#39;re much much better.  Just like the Grips,  Costume Designers, CGI Artist....  etc....etc....etc...
One of the best TED talk I have listened so far.
Te amo &lt;3
“Actors are only as good as<br>their writers” she throwin shade at d&amp;d for ruining got lol
If I was there and saw Maisie, I&#39;d scream like a 12 yo
LOL, the comments on the dead audience are gold. I enjoyed her talk quite a bit too, especially the personal story.
She&#39;s a damn war hero. Show some respect you damn bastards.
it i was in that audience i would be screaming for her
Her confidence shows on set and off set. Most speakers would have been thrown off balance with an audience like this. Arya the Silent Killer!!. I&#39;m a bigger fan now Maisie.
You are beyond the wall of people mind, so inspiring my lady..
I like Maisie but that was a load of meaningless gibberish
such nonsense audience for such an amazing speaker
What’s wrong with the audience in Manchester?!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Love this kid .. just love her. . !
Well she’s to young for a Ted talk, what can she share with us other than her child actor story?
Inspiring.  Thank you :)
The audience was undead.
Aye so, I listened. Really listened. And i mfing cried broooooo:(((((( Maisie you are wonderful i wish i could be your friend
bran like &quot;you were right where you were supposed to be&quot;
Maisie you were absolutely incredible. My jaw is on the ground because of how awful this audience is.
This is cringy
While I appreciate the life and times of Maisie Williams, there really wasn&#39;t much to this beyond the old &quot;Anyone can make it&quot; point.
Inspiring
I laughed and cried! I don&#39;t know the audience can be so emotionless. What an amazing little woman she is with so much wisdom, courage and wit.
Çeviri ekibine teşekkürler, altyazı olmadığı için izleyememiştim, şimdi izleyeceğim , sizin sayenizde ✌🏻
What&#39;s up Manchester??????
I&#39;m so proud of her💗💗💗💗
Wrong. <br>Strive to be talented at being famous.<br>(Like Kim Kardashian...)<br><br>I only opened this video to type this comment 😁
Don&#39;t strive to be talented, strive to be HAPPY
Really I ❤u
Came for the comments. Was not disappointed XD
1. Joffery<br>2. Cersei<br>3. Tywin Lannister<br>4. Illyn Payne<br>5. The hound<br>6. The tickler<br>7. Polliver<br>8. Walder Frey<br>9. Meryn Trant<br>10. The red woman<br>&quot; Valar Morghulis&quot;
This was an exceptional speech, and so inspiring. The only bad part was the audience. They should have been cheering for her and reacting way more - she&#39;s worked hard, and what a great success story. It proves you can achieve your dreams no matter what they are.
This was such an uncomfortable Ted talk..seriously, who decided Maisie Williams needed to do one of these? Great actress, lovely personality, but totally the wrong venue and vehicle here
No one is talking
The crowd is dryer than a nuns p*<b>*</b>
Public was silent till end due to its undivided focus of what this magic girl said.  We sometimes want to just listen to some talks without any noise (not even of claps in between).  I salute👏👏👌💖
Are there people in that hall?I wonder🤔
You deserve a better audience than this one. You gave a brilliant speech.
Ted talks are normally interesting, informative or provide a revelation, this was a pointless 15 min piece of drivel.  I feel sorry for the crowd, they made an effort to attend and got nothing to take away.
she is so damn funny omg
The girl is amazing.
Amazing talk! So talented and such an inspiration. Absolutely loved it. Thank you Maisie for all you have done, are doing, and will do from here forward. 🥰🙏🏽
I love how awkward and slightly nervous she was, it just goes to show to be great actress/ director, that you don’t need to have all confidence in the world. I think these TED talks are professionals, so to much laughter wouldn’t bring out the message the talkers are trying to portray, I would hate it if people where constantly laughing cause then I wouldn’t take it seriously and actually listen to the message.
See what a good British acting school can do.
damn you soul less Creatures
Why care about the audience not showing noise/reaction? They are focusing on what she speaks, not who she is.
Another we need a emilia Clarke Ted Talk...Please
Maisie can talk to walls ?! Sweetie you’re doing amazing.
A girl is no one. A girl does not need praise from the army of the dead to succeed.
I&#39;m liking all this dead audiences comment!!
So this is west of Westeros. Wow yeah where was this?  North of the wall?
This was amazing 🌹
Wow. This is the best Ted Talk I&#39;ve listened to so far. Thank you, Maisie! ❤😄
A very inspiring speech 😀 I remember seeing Maisie  a few years ago at a skydiving centre in Devon, she wasn’t jumping that day,  only there to support a family member but she somehow  ‘got’ persuaded to take a tandem skydive herself,  and smashed it 😀  fearless young lady I must say
All these people commenting on the audience, wind your necks in. The audience respond exactly when and how they&#39;re supposed to. They are LISTENING to her. Whooping and cheering mid-speech would be considered rude.
ARYA STARKK
Inspirational ..
i feel like this is a bit self indulgent ..
jeez watching this, knowing how it ends is heart breaking
I love you Maisie as an actress, and having the confidence to overcome this very unenthusiastic Crowd is not as easy feat. I’ve wanted to be involved with the music industry and possibly acting my entire life. Unfortunately my own identity issues had negatively impacted on my life very severely, causing me to doubt my own talent and stifling my confidence and pushing my own ambition further down. Fortunately being at university in the next academic year I’m definitely going back into the performing arts club as I’ve always been noted for being a well above average singer, unfortunately my confidence within my own identity issues and struggling at school with everything has damaged my acting ability due to not feeling right with Male roles even though I am a male. Seeing you aspire and become so successful and whilst being the same age as me is very depressing haha, but you have definitely made it worth your while. Congratulations Maisie.
LOL I spit out my tea when she did the lady gaga bit.
Girl is having a Tedx Talk. Men is proud.
My poor baby 💔 She deserves the world💓
That audience wtf
Maisei is wonderful speaker! I was enthralled by her talk.
What is dead may never clap.
Aryaaaaa Stark :D
Why is nobody laughing hahahaha
A girl can inspire.
Valar Morgulis!
I love her
I love her.
Killing the Night King got to her head..
comend section if you&#39;re fan of GOT maybe that have to realize that some scientist are not fan of the serie
she nailed it!!
Aarya is love
yeah Refuse to hold back, and dare to hold your dream!
I&#39;ve gotten to say it&#39;s wrong. You can be talented but not famous but it&#39;s harder to be famous without a talent. In any field whether it social media(now a days) or normal jobs to be known u have to be talented but u can talented without being famous. So yall aim to be famous
She is very articulate
What a beautiful soul. I&#39;m happy the audience was quiet so I could hear your words of wisdom. You go girl!
&quot;An actor is only as good as her writers&quot;
Absolutely love Maisie, amazing speach
Nice advert
=)))))))
God did not bless me with any talents.
you idiots - the volume of the audience is down. you absolute morons.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
this was a very nice speech but the energy off the audience made me cringe so hard i couldn&#39;t  get to the end
Omg  😂 the comments about the audience too funny and I totally agree
very inspiring and touching
Amazing Ted Talk,  Lame Audience
Wow, I got really inspired watching this video!
What a beautiful and inspiring speech. Well done Maisie. Thank you xx
people are dead like their dreams.. Maybe we are not destined do things like her.. We didnt went to any audition of GOT when we were 10..
&quot;😎.Talent will carry you so much longer than your 15minutes of fame&quot;😎<br>Give it to you baby
Dead flat audience response was entirely justified. Her speech was contrived, lifeless, and inauthentic.TED is about innovation, and she brings nothing but &quot;acting&quot; to the table. Try to understand how hundreds of brilliant audience members were hardly impressed.
She did great! Tough room though.
Love Arya from Egypt 🇪🇬❤️❤️😂
The British audiences are dead more than the dead army😂😂😂
I get the audience. It was pride and snobbery. What does this infant know? I almost fell for the same trap when I read the misleading caption. This was more a narrative and forecasting than it was advice.
Great talk Maisie. This audience though aarrrggggghhhh
That was beautiful ♡♡♡
this was cringey with that audience
A lot of people in the comments seem to be completely lost; the TED talk is not stand-up comedy.
a girl is impressive AF
was hoping that she puts her mask and kills everyone in that room, but I think they were all dead already.
Way2go Maisy, that audience was terrible, but you were great. I&#39;m going to try to get my kids to watch this.<br>You&#39;re awesome and deserve all your success and more,  it is known.
Jeez,  strive for talent? I could practice basketball 12 hours a day,  365 for my entire life,  and still never approach the talent of Michael Jordan.  Yes,  he worked to hone and improve those talents,   but the baseline he started from is incomparable to mine.  Poorly worded banner,  not thought out at all
At least there is applause at the end... That was &#39;real&#39; applause right?
A girl has talked well.
Did the crowd get to preview season 8 before the talk or something? Awkward af.
excellent ted talk. Her honesty is new in today&#39;s media.
Go Maisie!!!  Soar On!!!
A girl has no name 💜
Having a quiet room is a good thing. That means the audience is hanging on your every word.
So what&#39;s wrong with wearing your optimism on your sleeve - nothing I think. Of course I liked Game of Thrones (GOT)and while I don&#39;t avidly follow Maisie&#39;s career I have seen  her on other stuff and she was good. One of these was a monologue play and could have come from Alan Bennet except it was too modern but she carried it perfectly. And let&#39;s not patronise her for having few quals but being a pretty little girl. It&#39;s one thing to play a part orchestrated for GOT it&#39;s another to go out on that big stage and talk to a lot of dead people. At 67 I intend to follow her advice and dare again!
I loved Arya in game of thrones. Killing the Knight king in the skilled manner she did was amazing! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I&#39;m confused: How does one strive to be talented? Isn&#39;t the characteristic property of talent that you have it without doing anything for it? (or don&#39;t have it)
They should of had intermission and brought in a new crowd. What a bunch of dead beats!
welp, that&#39;s your typical ted talk with a celebrity. First the success story, then the gigantic add for the stuff she invested on, and after that, the army of fans all saying the same things in the comment....... I love Maisie, but this was more a waste of time than anything.
go Maisie!!
this audience sucks!!!
I don&#39;t take advice from rich cunts that have never worked a day in their life.
Beautiful message from Maisie and really opened her up to me as a completely new person &lt;3
i think it&#39;s an empty auditorium and they&#39;ve added applause at the end
Not a native speaker, but doesn&#39;t &quot;talented&quot; mean you&#39;re gifted? Something you don&#39;t really have control over?
Respect to her for giving this talk! I felt she wanted to practice talking to a large audience while letting others know more about her aside from being Arya.
This Girl is On Fire!!! 🥰🔥
HOW DO THESE PEOPLE NOT APPRECIATE HER AT ALL.
I think this is the closest I&#39;ll ever be getting to Maisie Williams, and what awe inspiring way to do so, the inspirational nostalgia is real.
The first thing she said was so funny how did no one laugh 🤨
tough crowd. i guess that&#39;s brits for you
I do love Maisie as an actress and so far from the outside as a person, I am an ordinary person and I also have big dreams. loved the talk, very confident and brave to do something like this.
And She is Arya stark , the hero of winterfell !
Yes ma&#39;am
Awsome one💐
She is talking to the dead army of the night king.<br> Like and subscribe my channel.<br>Thanks alot
Valar Morghulis
imagine being the annoying girl with the fish and the girl who got the part talks about you in her ted talk
love that lady gaga reference.
Dany was thinking about the audience when she unleashed her dragon on kinds landing.
that&#39;s really great, they are starting to break the dark ones dark system of dark control. Bravo
Stopped watching when she said she was given the opportunity to give this talk and THEN had to decide on the topic. Don&#39;t want to hear the famous talk about how the rest of us need to be talented...
A girl must not overestimate her Audience Of The Dead.  She should sail west of TedTalk instead.
I watch this and I see Me up there.
why is everyone complaining about the audience? We get it already...
Wow this crowd is so dead
Love Maisie so much! 😍❤️😍
her tedtalk is just super forced and scripted no wonder the crowd is not responding, Kid Cudi&#39;s for me is still one of the best ted talks
Undoubtedly, it was a superb talk and the audience sucked. However, as a &quot;big dreamer&quot; myself, I was wondering why strive to be talented and not famous? It&#39;d be great if this particular thesis was covered. I know that striving for fame may have its consequences, such as failing and becoming depressed or the possibility of being dependant on the validation of other people, thus feeling the need to satisfy their expectations, instead of being the real you. So, what should you do really? I&#39;m desperate to know the answer to these questions and more. If you persevere and do your best to achieve a goal(E.g becoming an actor), will you get there? If not, then how can you live this life really? So depressing:( Of course, you should try anyway, but you&#39;ve got to have some values to believe in to do what it takes. I don&#39;t suppose she&#39;d see this comment but just wanted to share this.
They dont know who she is because a girl has no name
Wait. A Game of Thrones audition was on a CHURCH??
Wounderful plateform can i talk on this forum. I am also a speaker of experiences.
I&#39;d.....
Her humour is a bit too self deprecating.
Bibinaa 😋
Tough crowd
I’m amazed... game of thrones was her SECOND audition? My LORD!
From “no one” during her childhood to “no one” now that we know. I will always admire this girl♥️ keep up arya. God bless!
Thank you  my arya
great.
Speaks for 16 minutes, tells nothing. TED Talks quality reduced so much.
god that crowd
I love you Arya ❤️
Maisie has done such a good job as aria stark. Well now that’s all I can see. No one. A girl is playing the game of faces.
this was great, thought the audience were a bit poe faced. Great job, Maisie!
Every pause for reactions had me cringing....tough crowd
Audience pisses me off.
I watch this and all I think about is that scene with gendry...
She probably gave them wine again.
Ariaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!
Status gets you more resources than talent alone gets you, plus, you don’t have to do the work. <br><br><br>Of course people care more about fame than talent. It’s basic behavioural biology
Continue learning, trust that you&#39;re good enough, ask questions and laugh at bullies, refuse to hold your self back and dream big. Nice massie!
A wise man once said &quot;what appears alive may not be alive&quot;<br><br><br><br>Yes im talking abt the audience
This is mainstream success. I don think I&#39;ll ever get that, but I think there are other kinds of success which doesn&#39;t require talent or being famous. Actually I think maybe it&#39;s all about people, even her and all the famous people. Being famous and/or talented doesn&#39;t guarantee you won&#39;t kill yourself.
Awwww girl you have been my spirit child since day one, i love that you are for the people and came from a simple background like many of us have! Reach for the stars and never stop moving towards your dreams people.
That&#39;s exactly what Rancho said in 3 idiots.
I don&#39;t get TED talks at all now-a-days
the audience are the night&#39;s kings army 😒
she is so wise for her age. we need more people like her in the world .a real role model.
Coloca legenda em português porfavor 😰
So tell me, how does one acquire talent after one in conceived?  Talent is defined as, a natural aptitude, which one can then develop into a skill.  Do not strive to be famous, strive to learn to read...I suggest starting with the dictionary!
Masie is quirky and beautiful. I really enjoyed when she said she hopes to build a place where people will share their art, not what car they bought. Word.
She did do many efforts to make them laugh but the audience was just quiet like Night Walkers 😆😅
A girl knows how to talk
Thank you, Maisie, for sharing your special story.  Also for Arya and Ashildr.  ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖
That was a great talk.
great except the part where she said season 8 will smash their previous records
Did Maisie just Get Good meme me?
I love you maisie..
She is now 22 years old.
The hardest thing a person can do is give a speech in front of an audience with no reciprocation. Not to worry!  Maisy&#39;s walking off the stage with the audience questioning themselves as to have they reached high enough or taken chances or played it safe in their own lives. All that matters is she&#39;s given others a new perspective on taking chances no matter what life has thrown at you and sometimes it&#39;s hard to cheer or clap for that person on stage when you&#39;re sitting in your seat assessing your own life while listening. I look forward to seeing other great things from you Maisy!
The best Ted talk ever
She really tried
that Lady Gaga reference tho!!
Maisie is very cool. But, with all due respect, I think a girl was too young, at 22, to give a Ted talk. She hasn&#39;t lived long enough and, as wonderful as she is on GoT, her experience is limited to GoT. A few more years &amp; a few more credits to her name and then, yes. Here, you see a talented actress trying very hard to reach an audience she&#39;s very out of sync with. Still, I think she&#39;s cool for giving it a whirl.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=676">11:16</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=719">11:59</a><br>Stating those words shows that you truly want to give aspiring artists a shot. Ms. Williams. Keep striving.
God the audience was terrible
we&#39;re looking for the word mastery here, seek to achieve mastery in something. talent is imo associated with things out of your control, like genetics. but mastery is about developing a skill rather than something you are born with.
Poor Maisie. Barely any applause, barely any laughs. She really, really, really tried.
No One is in the audience.<br>hahah
What if someone has no talent ? Don’t waste ur time trying to figure out searching for a talent. Be famous to get money so u can live
Arya stark!!!!
Maisie ❤❤
That crowd is full of assholes... Hope they be destroyed such as the dead army was.
She made funny jokes how is no one laughing?
this audience is completely made of dead walkers.
Welp. TED live audiences really are snooty, pretentious twats, aren&#39;t they?
I HATE THE HAIR 😭👎🏻
This was a fantastic speech. Wow.
Strive to be no one. <br>You would be someone
I have seen all GOT; but damn this talk bored me to death. I’ll quit and not watch tell end. BTW I didn’t know she was her till I really focused.
Maisie! I read your article on CNN about you being so sad because of how cruel people can be online and I just came on here to say I love how awesome your character is and how awesome YOU are!!! Forget the haters!
i don’t even watch game of thrones but i just think maisie is the sweetest ever. her energy is contagious!!! i wanna be bffs!!!!
Well, that talk failed
AMAZING!
The fashion, 😃😄
love this video!!! you go girl!!  I AM STRIVING TO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT... I made a video about mental health awareness maybe it could help someone out or even just open your eyes.. an impact on one person would make a difference for me!!! thanks have a fab day :)
That audience was awful. I would’ve screamed my head off for her.
Supebr
No one laughed (well very few)  and it was said I was the whole time
Arya: &quot;A girl is nobody&quot;.🙌🙌🙌Great inspiration to this generation
Wow
Inspiring speech but very boring audience.  Go Masie!
She was speaking infront of the Army of Dead with few alive prisoners, i really appreciate her efforts and she and her team working hard for everyone who wants to be a content creator, she&#39;s indeed a MVP hats off!!
since everyone already did the dead army thing ill change things up  a bit - it sounds like the entire audience took an oath of silence.
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  thank you Maisie
This crows was BS
there&#39;s more comments here about the audience than the words coming out of her mouth. get it together yall
Good for you doing the talk 💪🏽
These people were annoying, come do a talk over here in the US Maisie we&#39;ll show you the love you deserve ♡ bunch of uptight s*** h****. 💅🤷‍♀️
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 motivating! Long may she reign!😀
ted talk is not a place for applause throughout the performance. i&#39;m pretty sure they may even be told not to applaud throughout. <br>the thing is, some of her pauses were placed in places where no one is going to laugh except for her (i&#39;m not supposed to be here, oops! lol!) she did good tho. the audience was definitely very quiet
Inspiring as always, onscreen and offscreen &lt;3
Sad when you are not funny but keep trying so hard lol
People need to realize that the crowd simply wasn&#39;t mic&#39;d up properly. They were responding as you would expect, we just can&#39;t hear them.
Damn, I love maisie but I can&#39;t believe she had the opportunity to give a ted talk and she took it and turned it into pure advertisement for her app
Tiny magical thing. 😍 True realisation dear 👏
Porque al ver a esta chica tan agradable me recuerda el capítulo de los Simpson en q Maggi se tiñe el pelo de canas. O a la abuelita de Soprole.
arya arya arya :)
Says the famous
I needed this message.  Thank you.
Arya!!
Was there even an audience for that one?
The bible was created by many people who didn&#39;t go to school.
Great ! “Z” generation! It is the future! Congratulations
Her audience must have been made up of faceless men and waifs...<br><br>I&#39;m sure everyone in the audience is now on her kill-list... Or perhaps she took care of the list before her talk began..
Inspirational talk! <br>Tow of my friends have just named their newly female births Arya.<br>Greeting from Yemen
ugh what a terrible audience, she did awesome! ❤️❤️
good
Im confused with Dad&#39;s teacher...?
Its sad that they ruined her character in the post-book seasons...
She probably wrote all the audience in her list of names from the first silent response 😂
As I am jobless with a broken ankle I decided to pursue my masters degree... I dont know what Im doing but striving the best I can hoping to have a success story like Maicie! Ty.
Probably a good thing the crowd is dead so that we the viewers can be can listen to her undisrupted.
If you listened well, you&#39;d hear the feedback from the audience.. I think the microphone didn&#39;t go round enough over the audience
+1
The thing is... she doesn&#39;t hold the public, there is a feeling that she just reads a piece of poetry learnt by heart. She doesn&#39;t give a speech, she doesn&#39;t connect woth people. It&#39;s realy clear that she just learnt the text and read it out loud - no emotion, no cheeky girl she talks about. <br>Plus... you know, I&#39;m not sure she is a right person to give a speech - who is she really? A random girl who got lucky and got a role. There is a 50/50 chance she won&#39;t be seen after the end of GOT. <br>People just have no belief in her words.
ilh
No One is speaking.
She is so  talented .love maise . Love arya stark . Love game of thrones
She’s awesome. I will show her to my daughters as they grow.
So no one is talking to dead army😂😂
She&#39;s goergous , she&#39;s smart and funny but no one on the  crowd laugh at her jokes or applause
Everybody is cringing over the audience, but the reality is that loving an actress and being blind should not be the same thing. Her speech was ok but it lacked rhythm, energy, and unfortunately she lost them in the beginning. There was nothing of substance, and we need to be honest about that.
Maybe the audience was just captivated and just listening and taking everything she saying all in without interrupting by clapping since she is Arya Stark. I know I wasn&#39;t clapping while watching or laughing at loud by her jokes.
la creatura britbong
Says the girl riding on fame
***Spoiler Alert***If there&#39;s someone who hasn&#39;t watched Season 8 of GOT, like me, bc you&#39;re waiting for me DVD to binge, or haven&#39;t quite caught up...there are Spoilers in this comment section.
Wow !! Didn&#39;t thought lady of winterfell can dance and is one good inspiration as well.    Valar Morghulis !!
You&#39;d have to live under a rock not to know about GOT.  I&#39;m thinking the sound people edited the audience reaction for clarity.  There&#39;s no way Arya could walk on stage and not get a reaction.
This is so inspiring! Thank you, Maisie!
Her drive to get into dance etc at such a young age mirrors Arya in a lot of ways, no wonder they picked her for the role.
Gareebon ki Shirley Shetia 😪
Loved her speech!! I was actually moved by it. She&#39;s so inspiring.
Thank you, Maisie! It was really important and inspiring. I will right your words on my board :)
Amazing talent, building a software product without any formal education and being dynamic towards the journey of Life. <br><br>Surprised how most of the comment section is about The Audience though.
Soooo inspiring
Worst kept secret - they often pay to do TEDx and promote whatever pearls of wisdom aka BS they’re trying to sell you HOWEVER they actually speak to a completely empty auditorium with applause track going.
I liked the talk a lot. The crowd is indeed dead within. The only thing I don&#39;t like is the title - being talented is like a gift from god you got or didn&#39;t get, which is not under your control. So how can you &quot;strive to be talented&quot;. I&#39;d rather put it as strive to be professional and believe you are good enough to chaise your dreams
Why was I the only one who screamed when she said “...Game of Thrones?”
She&#39;s so young, but already so engaging and capable. You go, girl! <br><br>I love people who see a problem (the industry has a power issue that leads to abuse) and instead of just complaining about it, they stand up and say, HEY, that&#39;s not ok! Then do something to change it.
Awesome.
TED Talk was boring, would have been easier if she just said the famous line but eh, don’t care
I didn&#39;t plan on watching this long, but her story was somewhat captivating. Well done Maisie!
She seems cool af
I feel like I was the only laughing at her awkward jokes I mean I found her funny why wasn’t anyone else laughing lol
The winter realy came to this audience.
&quot;Even as young as ten...&quot; spacebar -Search box-gone
amazing waisie 😍😍
(despite muted audience). Greatly important and timely message. She also is involved with environmental charities like &quot;the Dolphin Project&quot;. Keep up the good work.
Probably one of the best TED Talks I&#39;ve listened to. Chris Williams definitely shows how well she can wow a crowd.
As brave as the role in got <br>I always wondered how does she do it at this. <br>One of the finest actors out there.
Worst audience seriously..
Great
People who dont deserve to be on TED are found in TEDX
I love her accent...
What a wonderful young woman.
I love you ARYA STARK! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
On second thoughts - this really is a dead dead audience .......... it&#39;s as if they all turned up to hear someone else but got Maisie instead! 😬😒☹️
Comments on dead audience are hilarious ......  it&#39;s certainly very very hard talking to a vacuum. But it could be that the audience sounds weren&#39;t audible
i love you Maisie. always will &lt;33
I love the simplicity and honesty of this talk!<br><br><br>What I got from it is that a burning desire, passion and determination are like flames. The wind may occasionally threaten to blow it out, people may overlook you or consider you unworthy, the vicissitudes of life will take a hit. <br><br><br>But if you keep your flame alive, sooner or later your time will come. <br><br><br>And when it does, you must bear the responsibility of passing on the flame to those coming up behind you. This is exactly why I created my youtube channel- to share my learnings from the transition to employee/business owner, inspire others that they are not simply a product of their past but rather can start again if only they can commit to doing so!
Beautiful... Simply beautiful... I love what this quote she said &quot;I was alone in my own head, and I felt the most alive&quot; those words resonated with me because I literally live them... Thanks so much for sharing your story and I look forward to viewing your app!!
Love it my baby Arya 😍❤ the character is always in you loveyaaa Maysie  😍😘❤
She&#39;s there because she&#39;s famous for her talent... <br><br>It&#39;s finally fame that matters!!!
Boring talk... <br><br>Why does everyone want to speak of big dreams after seeing success???
She is an amazing girl.
Luv yu gal
A girl can now give a talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=707">11:47</a> &quot;Actors are only as good as their writers&quot; whooosh D&amp;D
Next time you go to lock and arm you car please do something?<br><br>Listen to the HONK it makes and Think:  Would I want to hear that through the walls of the house or apartment I live in while Im sleeping or relaxing?  Would I want to hear it over and over all day long?<br>No?   .......Me either.<br>Please ......please please lock your cars Quietly with Light Flash Only.<br>Thank You.
Great speech maisie &lt;3 even if the audience you spoke to didnt get it
I think the audience is super jealous of her, especially the adults that have tried and tried in life to fail and succeed and she succeeds in her second try in acting and then her first try in entrepreneurship - two of the toughest industries to be in! She&#39;s also very humble. You can tell. &lt;3  Go Maisie!
Cold-hearted audience. She has more COURAGE and PERSONALITY to get up on stage in front of ANY of them and speak, than any of them would dare to dream of. YOU ROCK MAISIE! &lt;3
Queen Arya! Beautiful message.
Love all of you for these comments🤣 well done 👏
she is amazing!! really stunning and amazing!!
Arabic please
She is more than acter she is Arya dude 😍😍
Does anybody have the link of the app (its supposed to be out on android isn&#39;t it)
This made me think of Will Smith’s speech about the importance of working on your craft and that sentence about the threadmill he’s getting of last or dieing. About how what your gifted to be good at like singing is no guarentee to getting run over.<br><br>Nice to hear more about her journey and a bit of her upbringing.
Very inspiring!! The comments below are even funnier. It makes me want to call her to let her know how humorous and witty her speech was🤣🤣🤣
loved what you said maisie. needed to hear that today
Ha. She knows the definition of MVP better than most IT people I work with...
Well done!
I&#39;d rather see John Snow or Lyanna Mormont speak. They are the top guns, they lived their roles, they made us believe. They have this bravery about them to push the boundaries. Arya.. well, she was ok in the first two seasons, but didn&#39;t blossom to make her character a true, a living one. Her appearance in the gram northon show was a disaster. Dropped her as a teen of no interest. Too young, too fast a fame, no effort. She almost yawned every time it was not about her but about other actors, no respect or spark of interest.
I really want to believe there was a sound issue/mic issue, and the audience&#39;s reactions were not recorded. There&#39;s no way they would be this dead. Because if they were, what a bunch of boring a**holes!!
She is very young and confident speaker! Well done
The simple reason for the crowd&#39;s silence is the fact that this speech is mediocre at best. Everyone here praises her simply because they&#39;re her fans, but neglect to analyse the speech itself. Her writing is bad and reeks of entitlement.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=210">3:30</a> And now you ended up here with that terrible hairstyle. What a sad story. Poor girl.
Dead audience
Arya you are always true ı love&#39;u
👏🏻 👏🏻... <br><br>The dead crowd tho ! They’re prob a bunch of elders that live under a rock 💀
I just love her 😍😩🥰
Really... The Billy Elliott joke got a laugh but no other reactions? tough crowd.
Tough crowd. Well done Maisie.
Beautiful presentation, thanks Maisie
Forget cheering! No ovation, no applause! At least clapping expected but none! &#39;Dead audience&#39;! Feel sorry for Maisie.😂😢😭
I want to see your audience tape.  Please Maise if you can post.
It&#39;s very easy to be famous.
What?  She did a Ted Talk?  I&#39;m a big fan since I watch GOT.
nah
this was incredibly inspiring... and Daisie sounds like everything ive ever wanted.
Wow the audience is so unresponsive but she comes off as so relatable, funny, and smart
So this was repeatedly going up on my recommendations today and I always stop and think  that I should watch this but didn’t because I opted to watch another thing<br>Then I unconsciously clicked on this now feeling that I my soul needs this<br>Now it’s finished and im crying. I can relate bcs I badly want to become a professional dancer as it is my passion for as long as i’ve been alive but also been presented with different opportunities. Thank you for inspiring me Maisie❤️ <b>and also, im a GOT fan lol</b>
WOW SHE IS AN AMAZING YOUNG LADY!!!
So you’re basic an ordinary person with an extraordinary talent.
Wow I’m crying. I always loved Maisie because she was so kindhearted, powerful and insanely talented but this... this is way more than I thought. She’s incredible. I needed this speech. Now I feel a little bit more empowered to believe in my dreams and most important: in myself. ❤️
Yeah I agree with all the comments regarding the audience...like she just poured out her heart to us..A girl is inspiring...You know nothing, audience...
Was her audience a cemetery?
This is so inspiring. I know her just from Game of Thrones and love her character, Arya, but it&#39;s so refreshing to get to know her in a different light. I&#39;m so glad she did this TED talk and can&#39;t wait to see what she what new and exciting things are next for her.
Very inspiring Maisie
Dead crowd that was a really moving talk
I’m still confused about what Daisy does haha
Imagine if someone out there with a talent to make the world a better place but money or lack of it stops that talent, how can we ever progress as the human race. Inspiring Ted Talk, Summer is coming!
A girl has no name, a girl has no audience
YOURE THE BEST FROM GOT <br><br>And I’ll give you a round of applause since the people who didn’t appreciate you there didn’t 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You are my idol
いどんt i dont watch game of thrones but oh man i love this one
I want to say that you are amazing... and inspiration too...U make me realize that only dream and determination can make anyone to achieve his goal...and I love your role as an Arya Stark.
OMG....Arya Stark? <br><b>The resemblance is uncanny</b> I would say.!
Such a real person I can truly feel her sincerity. I pray she is successful many years to come.
<b>she is a night king slayer and a very smart girl</b> 😍😍😍
Maisie, U did it again! Ur so talented and amazing. 💕
That lady Gaga joke was great 😂😂
Love it Maisie.
This is just touching. I teared up. Good job Arya!
I think she did great humble beginnings and humble still I have a child her age and I got what she was saying and would be honoured if they attuned to her way of thinking she had something to say .I know I listened and actually was taken back with her ability to say believe in yourself look at where she came from who she was and now what&#39;s ahead endless possibilities
Totally inspired
I thinkn her audience were white walkers. They didn&#39;t response to anything
Is it a Stark talk? ^^
And what do we say to the God of the Death?
Magnificent speech. Beautifully Articulated.
❤❤❤
Free above all.
这个小女孩 肢体语言和表情 在平时就很丰富。
Hopefully she will survive the end of GoT. Most stars of one show disappear with their show.
1 of me would knock these kids out of the park
...DRACARYS (onto the audience)
ѕнe&#39; мaĸιng мe wanт тo тry agaιn. нer poѕιтιve aттιтυde ιѕ ιnтoхιcaтιng!!!
Fame worked for most celebrities, I rarely witness any talent.
Nice job
yay shes the girl who killed white walker boss! ^_^
She is wonderful. Rude audience
the audiences more terrifying than the night king
Uhm, Maisie, you&#39;re either born talented or not. You cannot acquire talent.
You&#39;re either talented, or you&#39;re not. You can become SKILLED at something, therefore amplifying the amount of existing talent you have... let&#39;s stop trying to convince people that they will be equally as gifted as someone who has both talent and skill.
It&#39;s a shame that the crowd was so dead 😞She did a great job! Idk what was up with them...
Thank you.
Ok so the people in the audience obviously don&#39;t have ANY emotions.  Poor Maisie, she did such a great job!
You started at 10 yrs.  But I&#39;m 37 years old.  How do I audition for Nanny McPhee?
The title is wrong ; its not don&#39;t strive to be famous or talented  its strive to be kind.
<b>audience walks</b><br><br>Me with a bell:  Shame! Shame! Shame!
SPEECHLESS
I really don&#39;t comment peoples clothing but WTF is she wearing there?! If you are not gonna behave like a youngster now then what&#39;s the point of being young!? Other than that, I admire her, she&#39;s amazing. (She killed White Walker lol)
She&#39;s just a kid who pretends to be a kid for TV. Come back in 20 years
First thing - It&#39;s the dead man army audience<br>Second thing - it&#39;s the NED talk<br>Third thing - It&#39;s the real Arya stark<br><br>There is a lot to learn from her words which r very true. Never hold yourself back and always dare to dream big...... Fantastic Arya Stark/Maisie Williams
her outfit is intriguing. The highwaters and ill fitted jacket gives her the little girl, doesn&#39;t care, adorable attitude
awwh, I love her!
Maisie: Are the audience asleep??? <br><br>James Rhodes: I think they&#39;re dead..
Is this a practice run? Nobodys making noise ? When i do here noise it sounds   recorded 🙁
Jesus christ if I was in that crowd I would&#39;ve been showing myself up just to make sure she got a decent amount of feedback, even if it all came from just the one person. Wise beyond her years!
Well the audience sucked, but her speech was perfect, inspiring and motivating! I just adore her. I look forward to following her career, and seeing all of the beautiful things she accomplishes.
She was great! That audience level seemed really low.
I think all audience belongs to &#39;Lanisters&#39; family
She needs more love from the audience
I love Maisie!
Wow that is some fuckin audience
She did good
strive to be on a show that makes millions, sometimes i eat toothpaste!
The audience is frozen to saw her amazing ted talk
Jeez ! Even the dead army had more life than her audience !
She clearly subverted the audience&#39;s expectations
A girl is wise and also an inspiration ❤️
People that colour their hair tend to have mental health issues!
I always thought that Maisie is good at public speaking. If i was there, i may not be able to give her big loud cheer but a sparkling eyes and smiling face.  She&#39;s so inspiring. ❤
Audience Supports Cersei I guess
WHY IS THE AUDIENCE LIKE THIS UGH
Maybe should have done the talk in the USA.
She’s really great
You killed the night king, that&#39;s good enough
Seriously the last 3 minutes moved me and made me tear up. Well done.
I cannot believe NO ONE was giving a chuckle or anything?!?!!? WTF It&#39;s like they cut out their laughing etc. Did they pic ALL 100 people who have no sense of humor or have ever seen GOT before??!?! GOD DAMN.....
wow :) I really love it.  &lt;3
before she killed the night king she was able to deliver this in front of the whitewalkers
I think I&#39;m obligated to make a game of thrones joke but I don&#39;t watch it. Yes I am the one in a billion. Anyways Me from Doctor Who dyed her hair!!!
Audiences are ded
C&#39;mon, Maisie deserves a better crowd than this
How did she escape from my pocket
It&#39;s not the crowds fault they are board. It&#39;s a lame subject poorly executed.
You were amazing ❤️❤️ you gave me  Tedtalks
But a majority of extremely talented people have mental illnesses, or issues.
TEdx operates way different than what your imaginations are telling you. People go there to listen and learn, not to laugh.   Think again
Direct her to a mirror with that message
And i think that&#39;s the thing about high school, it kills you ... where nearly all of the famous people nowadays who didn&#39;t went or finished school is so successful 🤷‍♀️
...but still here i am, listening to this beautiful girl, who i can relate too, but i suffer from really extreme depression, which kills me, literally
shes just acting here.
Great motivation and I learned about the new tool- Daisie- that will help me in my endeavour to build a successful music career!
Love her.. inspirational!!!
I thought she was just rehearsing for her Ted talk until at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=970">16:10</a> I heard the round of applause from the dead audience ☠️, <br>Talent truly Outshines Fame, well said Maisie 👏
Wow, she went from exterminating House Frey and the White Walkers to this! Amazing!
Her energy is so powerful. She and Arya are one alike; Maisie is brilliant.
NED TALK XO&lt;3 Maisie!!!!! Well done!
I love this because she&#39;s anything but ordinary!
She speaks so well 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽.
so true talent is far more important than being famous
you have inspired me with this message
Her fashion sense is off
she was so good for this audience
She shouldn&#39;t give Ted talks, She is no-one.
Everyone has a talent, or is talented in some way. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll ever learn to hone their talent into a professional skill.
valar morghulis
.......The crowd is very not engaging and very un-responsive. I fear they may be relations of the very dead Night King, if so, then I understand.
What a cold audience. 😤
that hair with that dress style with that sport shoes is just not fitting
Her story about meeting the actress in that workshop sounds very similar to her dialogue with Lady Crane in season 5.
Thank you
She used &quot;alas&quot; incorrectly and no one in the comments pointed this out? I&#39;m not surprised, really.
Lady gaga got mentioned.❤
this crowd is deader than an army of white walkers
This is really exciting
I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE MAISIE 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Later revealed her half brother was actually aegon targaryan rightful heir to the iron throne!!<br>funny how life turns out!
You are an inspiration
She is inspiring and bold!! Always loved her in GOT.
Rich people be like: money doesn’t matter<br>Models be like: looks don’t matter<br><br>Now famous people be like: don’t strive to be famous.
Amazing speech. Wrong audience. Huge age gap probably. You go, girl! 😊👊
STUFFY AUDIENCE 👎👎👎👎👎
She is 100% my favorite game of thrones character
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️This young lady!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fashion police is still looking for her... well said though
This was so cringey, that audience
Dead audience!!!!
There was a period when I used to find Maisie a bit annoying. Having seen a few interviews with her and this video, I think she is a quirky and inspiring woman. I hope the app is already on Android haha (I am not an Apple user) and that it is successful. All the best to Maisie! :)<br><br><br>P.S. The audience didn&#39;t really seem to get humour or maybe they don&#39;t like GOT?!
She is famous because they needed an average girl in yet another mainstream show to keep on pushing their social justice agenda. She says she has nothing to teach us and she is right. It&#39;s a waste of time to watch this.
GOT is known worldwide, it’s so weird that the audience wouldn’t know who she was, anyway she is beautiful and talented
What a sad crowd! I love this girl! If I was there, I would have been shouting in the crowd the whole time with excitement! Love you Maisie, What a Brilliant speech! &lt;3
Not today.
YES QUEEN
Number one audio may have not picked up the audience. It&#39;s also sometimes more respectful to be silent while someone is speaking in a auditorium so the noise doesn&#39;t drown out the speakers voice
she was very authentic. this was surely difficult for her. Great Talk.
This reminds me of Dave Grohl talking about being a musician not a rock star
Now she dances with The Dead.
I love you.
&quot;talent will carry you further than your 15 minutes of fame&quot; i felt that.
Audience.
I&#39;d say it&#39;s so random it could be any girl up there. Aspire to be lucky and get the role of your life and have the right accent for the part.
Audience is listening to No One 😂
she is walking too much, it&#39;s distracting
She did a sparkle-riffic job although the audience seemed pretty lackluster to her references and humor. For such a young gal she really seems to have a good sense of herself and following her own path which is so valuable in itself because there will be a lifetime of naysayers. Sparkle on!
What is wrong with the audience? She was brilliant!!
Woow! This audience...they clearly missed all the points that needed applause 😩😩😩
What a fantastic human
😍🤧🤧🤧
Excellent talk by a wonderful young lady.  Shame on that audience who did not support her talk. SHAME. SHAME. SHAME!!
Deep. So inspired. ♥️
&quot;Trust That You&#39;re Good Enough&quot;
I&#39;ll be damned before I let sid the sloth tell me how to live my life
You was on 🔥 Maisie. I&#39;m 94 and you well spoken for &#39;97. Thank you for sharing! One
I’m on my path to be a game designer but I still have passions for acting. I tried when I was a little girl and was told no because I was too chubby
Is this a rehearsal or something? Is she talking in an empty stadium or something? Why can&#39;t the audience give some kind of reaction? Or is it that the mic isn&#39;t catching their reaction properly?
She is so well spoken and confident. I&#39;m 21 and still had public speaking.  Wish i could be like that.
It feels like nobody knew who she is. I think this is what the faceless man mean by being no one. Either that or she face the dead army for the second time.
Omg the croud here is ridiculous..
Adorable and inspiring. Love that you are creating a platform where artists and collaborate!  Brava:)
Really I am super impressed...she is an inspiration...go girl
To speak so convincingly in front of a dead crowd requires humongous talent. She proved it.
Rude audience but she did a great job! :)
Thank you Maisie- you are the future
I LOVE MAISIE😍
I can&#39;t find the app daisie
Your very charmingly literate for your own good king slayer. A girl is a big fan 💖🥰
Lucky they didn&#39;t put John Snow as the speaker<br><br><b>You knows nothing, John snow</b>
You can see the hope rise in her eyes in that split moment of silence between a joke and the rest of the story before it quickly dies as literally fuckin&#39; nobody makes a sound.
You can&#39;t strive to be talented.
Awesome talk. I&#39;m always super impressed by people who can do public speaking this well. audience sucked
great
You can tell she is an actress perfect pitch and melody on her voice
I liked your jokes, Maisie!
I am sure if the Tedx Talk was in the US, Maisie would’ve had the applauses and respect she deserved. Maisie is amazing, talented and funny. The audience is just tired, they didn’t give her the right boost but she did it for herself. She dreamed big and is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love her for being herself.
she is so inspiring. Boring crowd, really
Damn the beginning was awkward!
Truly inspiring! &lt;3
Don&#39;t let that crowd get you down. The speech was fantastic!
Lol, that awful Gen Z hair<br><br>This video got 2m views? <br>I was out at the &quot;Average Tweets&quot; comment.
I love how everybody hates on the audience :D I think she did great as well and the audience was lame
Don’t strive to be famous, strive to be no one.
I love Maisie, she is such a beautiful being. This talk is really fascinating...
I love Maisie, she is such a beautiful being. This talk is really fascinating...
This crowd is dead. It is known...
fabulous talk.
Love u misa your performance is outstanding in got
Wooow👏👏👏👏<br>Thank you
Dude. That was gold
so funny...so inspiring...so talented....yet so young.......you slayed it girl.....Love love love to you....
Breath through your nose baba. It will help your health a lot dude<br><br>Thanks for your words
is the audience reaction muted or something
A listened, with bated breath, to every word.  I am inspired. Thank you.
this is just too hard to watch ? what&#39;s wrong with the audience?
The most simplest, shortest, straightforward speech ever heard from a girl who dreamed big from a place so small not even I knew she existed! WELL DONE!
Inspiradora. Thanks a lot to all the people involved.
Im super impressed, how easy it is to listen to her and guess what, she was definitely inspiring! I didn’t realize how funny she is. I wish the best in your endeavors, I hope to see more people like you who always stuck with their guns, even as a kid.
Tedx manchester is dark and full of silence 👻
Cringe
99k people saw this and liked it. If even a quarter of them have the attitude and determination of Maisie Williams... the future is in good hands :) &quot;There truly is a place for everyone...&quot;
For all who blame the audience, according to the all previous videos I watched, the audience is a group of selected people who in majority want to receive a deep message about the world and how to help more people, etc. Maisie did good for all of us, but when she tries to mix her speech with Game of Thrones and HBO, not all the people got her sense of humor. Audience must try to get the break points of her speech and that´s it, for me she is really amazing how the life managed well for her.
Night King
❤️
I&#39;m only on season 3. I&#39;m concerned about spoilers
I realized that there are audience listening to her at last.
I was watching the whole vid thinking every now and then why the audience have almost ZERO reaction to Arya’s talk, glad that I am not alone in my sentiments. Lol all comments  here are about her audience...
She is inspriational and amazing!
One of the most courageous talk in Ted.. Maise is the real  Arya Stark.
Honestly, they need to get audience suited for the speaker; Not just any old random person should be allowed to buy TED talk tickets. This audience was absolutely terrible. Maisie Williams is such an inspiring young artist, she deserves more.
Is Manchester in&#39;t North?
I loved this TED talk!
Sub Ita?
Well done Maisie Williams.  Well..done!
You killed it, Maisie! Good job, love! &lt;3
She seriously probably does not even understand what a gem of a person she is. She&#39;s incredible as a person. No role or achievement could ever be greater than her authenticity. Quite remarkable really.
The audience were a bunch of white walkers
Who has the app yet?
her audition for Game of Thrones reminds me of an audition me and my sisters did for a Kia commercial back when I was in 4th grade... We both got the part... I never became an actor (apparently the fees to stay in the Screen Actor&#39;s Guild are too high)
She is absolutely amazing
i WANT A TEDx  by the NIGHT KING &#39;&#39;How to act in life without blinking&#39;&#39; XD
The night King liked this
Ted talk are notoriously quiet, I&#39;m sure they were listening intently. Everyone ragging on an audience they can&#39;t see. Massie was lovely, the audience was civil and attentive if not interactive. It&#39;s all good fam.
the audience was full of white walkers
I love this girl!
Ya&#39;ll gotta remember people in the UK don&#39;t cheer for everything like Americans lol
You and your message is amazing and powerful!!! The audience not so much!  Keep up the good  work,you are one of those examples of what you can do when you put your mind to it.  Thank you for your inspiration
All those people wanted Kit to kill the Night King.
The audience knows nothing....
Yes cuz she should probably leave her first role ever was an opportunity of a lifetime even her co-stars mock this I wonder who she had to make smile to get where she is don&#39;t tell me that was hard work, or pure talent  there&#39;s no way someone who wasn&#39;t an actress  who was a dancer has the talent to be on a huge HBO show<br><br>Honestly I wouldn&#39;t be so reviled if TED Talks wasn&#39;t featuring her when they&#39;re shutting down true theologians and people who wish to question our society
None of the actors are big in Europe at all.
I should be one of those audience. ☹️ I love you Arya 😍
I really needed this one... Thank You, TEDx and Maisie!
A girl has no applauses, a girl has no public in front of her for what is dead may never die.
The audience is D R Y
The dead army is angry because she killed their <b>king</b> and went through them so easily.
Strive to the Night King even if he is surrounded by his army and you didn&#39;t see him once in your life. Go, believe in yourself, fly, juggle with your knife and aim for the one weak spot you cannot know about.
Its not what you know, but who you know
SHE IS GREAT AND HER CONFIDENCE STAYS ALL ALONG WITH HER INSPITE OF SUCH AUDIENCE..SHE IS A FIGHTER!!
Thank you Maisie! I loved your speech and your character in GOT!
A girl is at the hall of faces.. Audience faces are staring back to her.. No doubt for that silence ... A girl is no one too !
Maisie is perfect and had a spectacular yet simple message.  The &quot;audience&quot; response might have just been a consequence of social norms in Manchester.  I live in Texas, so I don&#39;t know what the social norms are for Manchester.  I wonder if the annoying girl she was talking about was Sohpie Turner (Sansa) 💖
I was in this audience and I do agree that we were very quite, but the reason for this was that she was the last talk of the night and people were just leaving, wanting to either get the tram home or get out of the car park first. Also to be honest she did have the balls to come out on stage and give her presentation however out of all the  people who came before her she had the least interesting topic. Plus the audience was not as dead as before her as we had a science guy come out and do some experiments about chemistry and he brought the crowd out as he was engaging and funny.<br>Plus what the video doesn&#39;t show is that she had about 2 to 3 one minute pauses where she stopped speaking, presumably for her to remember her speech. Which I&#39;m not knocking but honestly i think we were all tired after an early start in the morning to around 7-8 oclock at night.
She got lucky. There is nothing inspiring about this talk. It&#39;s a big Instagram positive vibes only post.
i&#39;m truly inspired
Arya Stark 💖
I can’t believe how dead the crowd is. Would have expected a big reaction by the crowd when she mentioned game of thrones .
I love how she quoted Lady Gaga...
super inspiring but Arya did you kill all audience before you start?
Massie is an example of why it’s not necessary to go college or higher education
You are awesome
A girl has no degree
My name is Maisie Williams, welcome to my ted talk
what an amazing human being !!!
Who are after the War of Winterfall...
i was not or never have been a dancer, however i know why now i lost my self in music now, at 45, hmmm, lets go clam digging together Maisie :)
Very charismatic she is ❤️
Amazing ted talk. I hope she finds even more success after GoT finishes.
She lost me in the first 20 seconds.
Amazing speech! And just know that I was laughing at all your jokes!!!
Really... nobody going to laugh at her lady Gaga voice?
Just a reminder, this was a Ted TALK not a circus act or stand up comedy. She was inspiring not trying to make people laugh. I&#39;m sure these people probably remember this talk because they weren&#39;t laughing so hard they couldn&#39;t hear.
Brilliant. Nice Subtlety subversive opening to establish the point of not having any formal backgrounds and qualifications for being an entrepreneur and activist. Most ppl lead off with that to say “hey here, listen to me”. But she goes another route by saying “see now that I have your attention...” very compelling. Very interesting. I have nothing bad to say at all👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Maisie, I think you are this audiences best kept secret
Don&#39;t be too hard on the audience.. remember, most of them are of the liberal, self-entitled, snowflake generation.. God bless you Maise, remember, stay humble and productive.. success is not who you are, but what you do with the life that was given to you..
I just feel like im giving presnetation to my friend as a part of assignment. And serectly asking them not to make any noise and any question....
I was hoping the &quot;i become a dancer, a water dancer&quot; joke
Bless her! This audience was awful. Her speech was wonderful!
Ffs that crowd is dead af
Is a girl talking to herself?
Why is the audience dead?
Why wasn&#39;t there massive applause when she said Game of Thrones?  lol yeah this audience sucks.
The audience is no one 😂 is anybody there .. Savage!
the audience noise  was silenced they are actually active
❤️❤️❤️
is easy for you to say
You&#39;re amazing!
This is very funny coming from literally the most overrated actor ever to be put on TV😂
She did such a great job, what a rude audience.
Girl now when you have money 💵 go and do something with your hair and style 😅
She is king killer🤗🤗😂😂
she is promoting GoT. lololol
amazing  just amazing  !!!!!1
Elle est vraiment moche
I feel so bad for her that audience was sooooo dead 💀
I think the microphone just isn&#39;t picking up the crowd reaction. There&#39;s no way they were all just staring silently.
Gawd if I was in that audience I would be so loud. I would just sit there and fangirl like crazy and laugh at all of her jokes.
I want to make an App<br><b>hires people to do all the work</b><br><br><br>-Strive to be talented
I&#39;m pretty sure they muted the audience . Most of these live performances they do that so they can hear the performer better
awesome idea :) and great talk
Did anyone in the comments consider that maybe the audience wasn&#39;t miked?
It&#39;s 3 AM and im starting to see weird things, like YouTube recommending me a TED talk of Maisie Williams.
Brilliant and thought-provoking speech. Was this a live audience recording? Why are they mute?
🖤🖤🖤
just leave i hate u
&quot;Hay un lugar para cada uno&quot;. Esta es una frase poderosa.
A girl will have everyone in the audience on her list...
Wow... she and i are the same age and her path and life is totally different from mine, but the one thing that today she transmitted to me is her envy, her trive? And her passion to become someone to make her dream come true <br>I love her as Arya and now i love her as Maisie ❤<br>And girl that career and confidence you have now is 🔥🔥🔥<br>Thank you to be an inspiration. From a small island girl on the other part of the world
<b>I guess Brexit has sucked all the humor out of people today</b>
WOW! Tough Crowed!
<b>Trust that you&#39;re good enough</b><br><br>I cried. I need this right now.
tough audience. She is actually funny. Weldon Arya!
Gurl her audience are the worst. Makes me wanna dracarys them all.
She is rawsome
Respect to Maisie. She is very good actress and has good words.
I love this girl so freaking much. Watching this actually got me choked up and I honestly can&#39;t explain it omfg
I can relate with this. Laudable. Thanks to Maisie
Maisie, that took a lot of balls! Greatest admiration for anyone who can stand up and talk on a stage like that. Well done girl, keep doing great things! :)
don&#39;t strive to be talented, strive to serve the Lord our God.
What an awful audience.<br>Love from Mexico
great speech, amazing young lady.
This was great! What a tough crowd though. I guess thats Manchester for you! LOL!
Maisie Williams you were great! you are awesome and inspiring! keep up!
A girl is Arya Stark of winterfell and she’s a king slayer.
The silence made me feel awful...
I am completely blown away! She is an amazing woman and I can&#39;t wait to see where life takes her. Good for her!
J&#39;espère que la traduction est disponible en arabe
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=469">07:49</a> is such an awkward moment. 😶 but what an amazing speech she gave!
well tbh there nothing to agree or disagree with.Ok let´s all agree creative pepople are admired more than ever in a wide range of the sociaty but that´s all about it, isn´t it?<br>I just wondering what is the point?
Humankind taking baby steps,  a wonderfully new person.
Arya...
It seems like  if nobody was there
Inspiring! ❤️
ask questions = ]
being famous is a talent in itself  :|
Maisie , what a beautiful &amp; inspiring soul with a dead audience
Not enough credit is being giving to Maisie here! What an exceptional speech! No formal qualifications but can stand on stage and deliver that. Nothing but admiration!
i need meet this girl
The audience was quiet because no one&#39;s on the stage
Awkward..
Poor girl this audience showed her no love lol. It’s ok girl u still the hardest Stark. Arya for the throne
Love her even more
she is so beatifull!Love her!And her style,just like mine.I find her funny as well :)
Is this gunna make me cry?
I don’t know if I can finish this.. I’m kinda hurt for Maisie 😔 wtf audiences!!
Facing these audience was definitely even harder than facing the Night King.😱
i bet all the audience are old ppl
Arya 😊
loved this so much!
Put as a background music &#39;&#39;Game of Thrones S8 - The Night King - Ramin Djawadi&#39;&#39; very epic while she talks!
i am wondering if there&#39;s actually anyone in the audience or is this a rehearsal?
4 ft tall, to a whopping 5 ft tall XD, i just love her so much.
Can&#39;t get past knowing one of the toughest, togetherest characters on tv is this sweet friendly girl.
&quot;Terrible Marriage&quot; <b>everyone laughs</b>
I hated the audience so much.
With these Audience it was had to even watch
Time to join a talent agency so that I can kill a king next 💅
Wow. Brava
Awful and lacks content
Where can I download her app?
Hermoso!! GRACIAS!!
First she kills the night king and now this great speech!! Love you Maisie!!
Thanks Maisie!
who knew that someday you will kill whitewalkers!
Masire did a great job! These people are super rude.
I&#39;m the Smartest Man Eu for the last 100 years. Can you handle it
She paused when she mentioned games of thrones at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=473">7:53</a> to see everybody reactions.
Arya Stark I love you
How are the people in the audience so quiet? 🤔
So sorry, for  Maisie. A girl killed the knight king and then battled the dead army in the audience.
I wish the audience there when she talked were us here in the comment section so we could make some noise esp when she mentioned game of thrones and applaud her. Gosh, the audience in this ted were so tough!
a girl has no name
Omg all the comments are about the audience being dead but I agree 😂
Love you honey !
I was literally wearing a t-shirt that says &quot;good enough&quot; when I stumbled over this, and having a break from editing a short film. Will def check out this app!
WOWWWW
Valar Morghulis
i admire her so much
Lone wolf dies...but the pack survives..! 6 to 16 and to many more in the coming years!
الجمهور مستتتتفززز
I only came to the comments for the roasting of that American accent and am sadly disappointed 😔
Ohhh come on now! What&#39;s wrong with the audience? I mean she is really kind and try her best to make them understand her point using a bit humor, but few responds to it! Come on now! Just try to return the smile that she gives you! I think that her talk was really good! 😁😁😁
You killed Night King!!!!! <br>I love you, Arya and Maisie Williams 😆😆😆
sweet and wise &lt;3
AND THEN SHE KILLED THE NIGHT KINGGGG
I am sure she was thinking of this audience when she stabbed the night king.
Smart , very inspiring..lover her... YOU GO GIRL
the moment she says &quot;game of thrones&quot; and pauses for room for aplause and not a sound is heard was so uncomfortable, it truly feels like everyone there lives under a cave and never heard of jokes and tv shows.
I just know one thing she saves the humanity from the Night King..
I don&#39;t know if people realize how confident she is for her age. It&#39;s incredible. She&#39;s so witty, smart, powerful, grounded and strong. She seems to understand very well the world around her and navigated well through it. She&#39;s awesome. That was so emotional, she put her whole heart and soul into this talk. I can&#39;t wait to see what she does next. I&#39;m going to check what Daisie is about. Such a wonderful speaker.
I never knew she could speak so well..i meam..whoa..i wasnt bored at all...adults bore me easily but this girl spoke so well and i really enjoyed listening to her...Wow..<br>A girl can speak
People commenting on the crowd being rough… The room just hasn&#39;t mics recording it, only the speaker has one. Therefore you barely hear the crowd in the background but they probably laugh at most of her jokes.
I like the comments about the audience..**<br><br>You do know that the mic only pic up her voice dont ya
I wondering there&#39;s no audience watching Game of Thrones. Give she a big hands like she killed Night King.
I agree with all the comments D: This is pretty awkward haha
She is great.
Who is she? 🤔
In my view, she was the least inspiring of all the speakers there on the day. All about me, me, me. For an actress who should be able to remember lines, she couldn&#39;t remember much of her rehearsed speech. She may be good on TV but a public speaker she is not.
oh arya stark!
More ted talks trying to sell me things .
I guess her audience were the dead army of the night king.
&quot;trust that you&#39;re good enough.&quot; I love that, it&#39;s so true and a great reminder
So that you get to kill the Night King.
ВЭАР ИЗ МАЙ РАШЕН САБТАЙТЛС?
Good Ted talk
HERE AFTER WATCHING THE EPISODE 3 S8!
The audience was so awful! My goodness sake! She&#39;s just a wonderful speaker. It&#39;s just the audience, very dull! I love Maisie!
If she had become a professional dancer, the Night King would have killed Bran. It was all written.
Magnificent. I have nothing but respect for her, and wish her well. She really does seem like a great person.
is she okay low-key? :(
Thank you so much. I work as a mental health therapist with people who are working and poverty class. <b>SO OFTEN</b> I see talented people end up beaten down by life despite their talents. Watching you talk, you reminded me strongly of a little girl I&#39;ve known for a number of years with talent pouring out of her pores, who <b>never ever ever</b> stops improving her craft. Here&#39;s hoping she gets out.
Amazing! I saw a clip somewhere where she said she cried all the way home after this talk thinking she did poorly.... HOW?! This was eloquent, entertaining, timely, funny (even though the audience seemed daft), and truly an &#39;Idea Worth Spreading&#39;!  Loved it and love her!
Aria Stark?
She inspires me so much omg
The crowd are either white walkers or walking dead fans
The best thing in GOT!
Poor of her !talking to nobodies !
Epic
Most of them were silent...because most of them remember the last time a girl speaks in front of audience.
Why didn&#39;t she talk about the no one internship hhhh
AN ABSOLUTE QUEEN
Rancho ke funde
Well done!!!! x
Best teenage novel ever!
You can almost hear the cringe in the audience. Poor girl.
Thank you, Maisie. I really felt everything that you have said and shared. It&#39;s all about the craft that we are most passionate about but sometimes, money can really be a hindrance. <br>I love you, Arya. ❤
Maisie, you are an amazing woman. Your thoughts on talent over fame and knowing you are good enough will inspire so many young people. I actually felt proud watching and listening. You have a focus, drive and a huge heart. I know Daisy will help so many talented individuals who need to know other people care about what they create and are there to help them in any way. 💗💗
this audience.....
the audience was a bit... Stark
She&#39;s amazing
someone plz try to restore the audience by giving cpr....
She handled the no laughs so good , I would of walked off after 5 minutes haha
What&#39;s with the crowd tho
Wow this crowd suckssssss!
you are great... I look up onto you
What is this crowd ........ GOD.. she deserves so much appreciation during her talk.  She is such a talented person with positive vibes
Needed this! Thanks Maisie.
Amazing! Really inspiring talk 🤗
Impressive. Trust you are good enough!
Very true and inspirational 😊👍🥰💖
I hate this crowd
I&#39;m so proud of her. Inspiring x
What about Doctor Who?
i was at this event live. i loved the message but there were a bunch of moments that have apparently been edited out where she froze up and didnt say anything for about 10 seconds. there was an awkward atmosphere to the entire talk, for whatever reason, which is why the crowd wasnt engaged and cheering so much. it was all rather peculiar. crowd was very engaged for other talks at this event (which are available on this channel) and were all looking forward to this talk.
This speaker looks like Arya from GOT!
This made me cry as I completely understand what she&#39;s saying!
A girl has no applause
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=475">7:55</a> you can see her feeling insecure because she was expecting the crowd to cheer up. What a tough crowd.
:/ i wouldnt get the chances she had especially faced with parents who are so strict about getting the right education. Always has been my dream to go to acting school but here i am in uni doing a subject that was forced on to me with no way out. :(
&lt;3
In Masie&#39;s, as in all/most TEDx Talks, the microphone is attached to her and DOES NOT pick up the sounds of the crowd unless they&#39;re extremely loud (far more so than a polite crowd is likely to make). That is why you so commonly see people make jokes/big revelations in these and get absolutely no reaction - because the microphone is focused to the speaker, not the crowd, so a polite chuckle that lets her keep speaking doesn&#39;t register. I really wish they&#39;d put this at the start or something so that 90% of the comments section in many of their videos isn&#39;t complaining about the dead crowd.
the crowd is horrible
I love You maise
What an exceptional young woman...just when I thought it couldn&#39;t get better than Arya Stark, she says, &quot;Hold my beer.&quot;
Is it me but I&#39;ve been waiting for her to get to the point (stipulated on title) until the end of the video?
Welcome to my channel please like share and subscribe kar do
No wonder she got the part for Arya Stark.  She&#39;s courageous, charismatic, and creative.
What a boring audience
Just wow
Damn, what a tough crowd. They&#39;re the worst, but you go Maisie!! So inspiring and funny &lt;3
i kinda feel bad because her jokes were really good but the crowd sucked. it’s not the best feeling when people don’t laugh at your joke. she deserved better
A girl is talking to no one
Great Ted Talk! I certainly hope the crowd response was better live than what is transmitted via this video. She did a great job and was inspirational. I found her jokes funny and her timing excellent. I wish her all the best in her acting career and her entrepreneurial career!
Clickbait at its finest.
Quite frankly l was inspired by her speech her intelligence and awareness of whom she&#39;s become n what she has achieved as a young actress is definitely amazing sometimes we have to step out of the familiar routine into the unfamiliar territory of life believing in ourselves despite what is stacked up against us ,More power to you Maisie Williams as you continue to be an inspiration n motivation of what is achievable when we step out ! Planning, Preparing,n following your dreams 💕💕✌️
Strive to be lucky
Impressive.
I actually hate the audience
The crowd wasn&#39;t being tough. The way the audio has been mixed for the purpose of this video means that Maisie&#39;s voice is not drowned out by the crowd laughing etc. This is a technique used on a lot of videos published by universities and lectures and conferences.
Cool speech. Keep up the good work Maisie!
A smart ad
It is so great to see someone that is able to just go for her dream and not going like a sheep through all the established stereotypes, etc etc. Good for you Maise, by the way, my favorite character in Game of Thrones!!
I see everyone talkin about the audience&#39;s toughness but damit....<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=102">1:42</a> was a &quot;must react&quot; moment
Such an inspiration. Meeting you one day is definitely on my list
The crowd isn&#39;t dead, self depreciating humor is a very much young person&#39;s brand of humor. The kind of people at TED talks aren&#39;t gonna be big into back to back to back to back self depreciating jokes, especially when they aren&#39;t even that witty.
That was a great TED talk, for Maisie is an oustanding and inspiring person! It was sad, that the crowd didn&#39;t react to her jokes, the way they should have. Respect to what she accomplished on this early stage of her life! :)
👍
Everyone is talking about how tough the crowd was but maybe you’re missing the point in her message. “Strive to be talented not famous.” It’s important that we stop measuring our value in the opinions and reactions of others. Maybe the audience was just listening very attentively. Regardless, what a powerful message that is so important in this generation where our value is defined and measured in all the wrong areas.
Beautiful... really inspiring!
She&#39;s got too much make up on
its nice to hear about her life but it would be nice if she told us something nice or inspired that she seen on her ten years of got or in the business
Worst crowd ever D:
so inspiring
She is a great orater...no brainer :)
Love this talk! She is so inspirational!
1k dislikes are from frey family
love  ted talk
such a poser.
INSPIRING
What&#39;s wrong with the crowd? No cheering, no applause, like come on..
her face said 👁👄👁
my lil baby
Anyone after ep2 here? :D
I didn&#39;t expect to get any wise word from a tale &#39;like&#39; you Arya..
I really love her. Not just as an actress, but as a person.
Love her!!!
Gets lucky with a big role and now is all knowing.
We are connected. We are aware. We are the Future. <br>~ Maisie Williams<br><br>...what a beautiful &amp; inspiring soul
Another one.
THIS
wtf, have they sealed the mouths of the audiences?
God damn this audience!!
I love you even more !! Best ted talk..
she is acting. which makes all of this look fake..
Musicians are only as strong as their producers? I&#39;m insanely offended by this hahaha.
Misunderstands her own good fortune, mistaking a series of fortunate events and her natural regional socialisation for evidence of talent. Sometimes just being what you are makes you a fit for something. Someone else with the same determination and effort but different background, personality, accent, mannerisms may not achieve the same result. This is why TED should be given by people who are intellectually above average, not just popular or visually appealing. The lack of universal applicability sterilizes the efficacy of the message. Just like any other visually oriented profession (like modelling) she seems to be where she is professionally because she is what she is more than due to who she is or how she has become as a result of her own concerted effort and striving. The wrong person striving equally as hard may or may not succeed, which is kind of my point. The real substance of what makes someone effective in the pursuit of fame or renown escapes the scope of this talk because talent is a nominal truism. This renders this talk then as a kind of ego stroke (&quot;I&#39;m here because I&#39;m talented. I&#39;m probably responsible for the extreme success of the show I play a role in&quot;) and virtue signaling (Having talent makes you succeed, despite there being loads of artists who can barely put food on the table for their lack of acumen as business people; such artists are 100% talent but none of the other pertinent skills of a financially and famously successful person, which is another problem). An informed talk would&#39;ve shown contextual awareness of these realities and addressed them with an elegant solution.
Strong words, inspiring and definitely mood changer!<br>Tough crowd! But I literally clapped when she was done.<br>Absolutely amazing!
The audience are the worst damn!!!
I felt Awkward being the only one laughing at her jokes 🥺
Really inspiring to watch  !! Kudos and best wishes
Those were funny jokes, that audience sucked
A girl is great at speech
That was brilliant! Excellent message
Today was a particulars bad day for me... Watching this reminded me of so many things I had forgotten about myself.<br>Thank you. :)
Maybe the audience was in awe because they were watching Arya Stark give a TED Talk about her life.  Maybe THAT&#39;S why they were so quiet.
Fame trumps talent every time.
Yes😿 I am good enough
Crowd was very dry.
when women try to be funny
Terrible and non-encouraging crowd (apart from a select few). Great performance on the part of Maisie Williams, a girl with a name who knows something.<br>(Edit: Oh yeah, why the f* were they keep editing the clip...)
I get you Maisie. I don&#39;t want this... I <b>need this too</b>
Her face bugs me
If you turn on closed captions you can see that the audience is more engaged. lol GREAT TALK!! Although, it seemed like the audience wasn&#39;t as excited as other Ted Talks.
I really like this. I like what their mission is with their app.
I really hope the audience just wasn’t mic’d
EVERY KID AT TEN SAYS &#39;MUM. I WANT TO GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL&#39;. Fact. But not all mums can afford it, or they worry too much about boarding.
WTF THE CROWD
so what&#39;s her tallent?
😘
I didn&#39;t have a celebrity crush before her. She&#39;s got something unknown but incredibly rare!😍
Love the character Aria Stark and now I know why. Although iBoy wasn&#39;t a great movie I watched it cause she was in it. Love it when you see an Actor/Actress who you&#39;re just so in love with their character because they are so talented and learn how truly inspiring and admirable they really are.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just the lack of microphones focused on the crowd that makes them seem dead, I saw her interview with Lewis Howes and she herself said the audience was dead and how she cried afterwards because she thought she did terrible
Sorry but this audience was terrible...Maise was amazing, thank you for sharing your story, you are so inspiring!
Amazing delivery and excellent points about talent over fame and building a connection and forming a team with those who believe in you over clamoring like so many crabs for that one “contact” that you hope can make things happen for you. <br><br>Very inspiring and genuine.
Well done Maisie Williams from the council estate, you should be very proud of yourself, you have achieved so much for your age, wish you all the best for the future ❤
The audience didn’t laugh at anything! I thought she was great!!!
Then came you actress
Luck and disposition.  Unfortunately, you could do everything right and even excel but nothing will come out of it.
she was funny and great! ❤️
Maybe this is just her not really articulating what she&#39;s trying to say properly, but she comes off as a little pretentious.
❤️❤️
just wondering what’s the app’s name ? Love her!
wow this audience is dry. maisie is brilliant!
The world needs more people like her
Very nice speaking
You are amazing, hats off to you.
I clicked on this only to prove to myself that it would be cringe
love you maisie
I cant even see the audiwnce yet I&#39;m getting a &quot;what does this kid think she knows&quot; vibes
Don&#39;t strive to be talented. Be talented.
A Ted Talk from No One.
Had a major crush on her when she started on GoT. We’re the same age so it’s legal.
Wow!  This came at the right time for me and for my progeny.  Thank you for this inspirational talk, Maisie.  SO much more interesting than many of the TED talks I&#39;ve heard because you kept it real.  (Also more interesting than the boring audience you had to perform for.). Blessings for your future! &lt;3
I&#39;ve been burst into tears watching this video! you rock Maisie, thanks a lot for the inspiring thoughts and vision of world❤️
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m no one&quot;
Easy for her to spout all that rubbish when her life has been given to her lol
Really? Oh lord, they cannot find people to invite, huh?
As so many stated below, by sheer example this audience gave us, the viewers, a thought-provoking look at the difference between extraordinary talent, and all a field of spectators. This was a collective of confused souls, if you will, the lot of them &quot;meandering&quot; at the door of opportunity. They might want to pass through, to become...they might spend much of their lives listening to the anecdotes of those who have, but few if any having more than a passing curiosity, and possibly, less talent. Shame on them for their lack of responsiveness, and the 1K thumbs down grouping of individuals who were forced to realize they might never amount to anything.
What a lovely inspiring talk..the bit in the end was exactly what I needed to hear today..thank you so much Maisie
The Kardashians left the chat.
中文翻译君在哪，大多数都听不懂，快帮忙翻译一下呢，谢谢了😘
Thanks for inspiring!
Ever see someone that just doesnt look like a human?
This was awkward.
Love this one
It&#39;s my rehearsal english exam at my school on monday, and we study british english, and I&#39;m sooo scary. I just trying to understand the speed, intonations and accent (which ISN&#39;T an accent, I know) I understand what she says, but how can I speak as she? Her speech is very great, at my opinion. Her story is magnificent
Is the Android version out yet?
really. inspiring. shed a tear tbh
Should&#39;ve called it &#39;Maisie plugging Daisie&#39;
The audience are so tough like damn!!
i don&#39;t strive to be either, I just strive to marry Maisie Williams
Powerful Maisie Williams 🙏
Wow so inspiring !!!
I&#39;m not talented.  I&#39;m not famous.  I don&#39;t care.  I beat to my own drum.  I bagged them all this time, and they still escaped.  Must be nice.
Needless to say the audience is a bunch of old professors on the verge of retirement
Amazing speech, but I think 🤔 famous is not what I wanna become. Having talent isn’t all. But I appreciate that she is trying to do something for the people in her industry.
Jesus, the crowd sucked! She was sweet, funny and spoke very well. Don&#39;t know how the crowd wasn&#39;t connected :( I don&#39;t even watch stuff she is in, but I liked what I knew about her and this was great!
She&#39;s adequate, but she&#39;s a bit too big for her britches.
* Insert Jim Carreys, &#39;The Girnch&#39; touch crowd meme here *
Yes Maisie give me that inspiration!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Also, wtf was up with that crowd?¿
Your my favorite in game of thrones!
she is great, could listen to her talk all day
NEDx Talks, guest star Maisie Williams: strive to be no one.
A girl is perfect.
I actually think that this is true. All these instagram stars with just fame is probably not going to last. Some try to have a talents like fitness, which isn&#39;t really a talent anymore but anyone can do it. It&#39;s always the same movements and science that everyone can access. Same with beauty or fashion unless you have a style that is really different and you don&#39;t change it with the trends. Many of the famous people trust on their looks but it won&#39;t last. Someone better looking, richer, maybe more plastic surgery will take the place. Fame is only for 15 minutes these days as she said. In 10 years I do think those who have a talent and a dream for something else than being famous will success. Loved this actually more than I thought! 😁
She’s well spoken and wiser  than people half her age. Including many past ted talkers
This is so inspiring!
I don&#39;t have an iPhone cause I have limited money... when is the android version coming up
I found my dream when I was 10 as well lol
How does nobody know her, Holy F! Shes like the most famous person on her age rn! Im sad to see her jokes not being laughed at.... come on ted talk fans
Why was the audience so touch on her that was a really good tedtalk
Why was the audience so touch on her that was a really good tedtalk
Why was the audience so touch on her that was a really good tedtalk
Poor girl.
Bravo Maisie...very inspirational speech! I love seeing people swim against the tide and win! ❤
“What could I possibly say, that would have any impact?”<br><br>Plenty; but, you went with... nothing.<br>Putting the x... in the TEDx
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=130">2:10</a> I know where this house is, I grew up right next to it. I used to travel past it so often before I knew she lived there. By the time I realised she had just moved I think
You can&#39;t strive to be talented. Talent is something you&#39;re born with. Skill is something you achieve. What one should strive for is to be skillfull. And even then, genetics and environment still play a huge part. Contrary to popular modern beliefs, not everyone can do everything. Sometimes it&#39;s best just to focus on something that you can do, rather than something that just isn&#39;t working for you.
This had me cryinggggg 😭
ARYAAAAA ILY 💕
This audience....
The audience were whack! Really enjoyed Maisie&#39;s talk, took a huge amount of courage much more than i could muster up. Keep it going Maisie.
oh this is sweet
So dead audience 😐
but isn&#39;t there deviant art already? which is kinda dead these days so is this like new deviant art but without a following or sth??
Few people got her humor because most of the people who go to TED talks are old fucks
&quot;There truly is a place for everyone&quot; &lt;3 &lt;3 A girl has a delightful sense of humor. Thank you for giving a real talk about your history with a renewed perspective on what&#39;s important to remember. (PS: That crowd, you gave such wit and inspired me (and not, ;) hehe) I&#39;m only hoping based on other comments that they were livelier than it appeared)
Daisy is going go be a great gatekeeper.
Waoo..it was fabulous speech....
Beautiful talk, Masie! You are indeed an inspirational person. All the best with your life and career :) God Bless.
She will die killing a white walker. <br>Kill me later 😊
I can see the age gap between the speaker and the audience. Few got her jokes.
I really enjoyed the talk. I think Maisie has a great message.
Wow what a Novel idea. I had thought about creating similar app for actors and musicians. But your intentions are more broader and beautiful. By the way if you would have use ReactNative you could have created app for both iOS and Android simultaneously. If you ever need technical expertise, I am available to lend a hand with Architecture and Amazon AWS Solution for your app.
As soon as I saw the thumbnail I knew I’d feel inspired and I did. &lt;3 I truly hope I can achieve my dreams like how she achieved hers.
It&#39;s strange how good she is in Season 1 of Game of Thrones at such a young age and with such little experience. She seems totally at ease and in character as Arya, and Arya is one of the most likeable and well-developed characters in the show. Even alongside great actors like Sean Bean!
love this
As much as I like GOT and M ..now anyone can be on TED 😑
Excellent
I&#39;m confused I thought Syrio Forel was her dancing master.
Irony is that the &quot;Actress&quot; is saying that we should not strive to be famous 😂😂
Good words and talk, Maisie. 💖
Who is the &quot;Dom&quot; character?
Maisie good job!!! I believe in you !)
Maybe she&#39;s right. But nobody can deny the poison of Kylie Jenner. Famous does send you to Forbes list.
man all he had to was run zigzag
so weird that good-looking people are always famous and succesfull and talking about hardwork. well guys what.. those doors that opened for them, don&#39;t judt open for you. you have to work thrice as hard to even get your foot stuck in the door and try to get the same opportunity as they get by just walking passed it. and don&#39;t strive to be them, strive to be the best version of yourself.
Thank you for this! I&#39;m not in a creative industry, but, I think this topic spans different industries. <br>Also, I, unlike your audience got your sense of humor and laughed when you were funny.
Can&#39;t think of more unhealthy goal than wanting to be famous
Damn...this is a tough crowd..geesh
&quot;Stick them with the pointy end&quot; <br>Standing ovation
Simply remembering all of those lines is impressive.
I thought talent was innate.
She is Arya
This crowd was a bit flat, didn’t get her humour but she’s beautiful and inspiring 😊
i don&#39;t want to be famous.. i want to be rich
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=100">1:40</a> <b>silence</b>  <br><br>me: LOOOOOOOOOL
That&#39;s not inspirational
One of the best TEDs
Fighter at heart.
I strive to be wealthy
&quot;...and dare to dream big.&quot; Those words I will never forget.
Wow Maisie!! Such an inspirational TED talk!! Thank you!!!
I love her but man do I hate how people have to say “I was brought up in a council house”. No one ever says “i lived in a privately rented house” or “my parents had a mortgage on our house”. 🙄🙄
I mean she seems to have good in mind really and that is nice, but ye isnt she not just someone who used her fame to make this app she did with someone succeed and all i hear about is talented people and famous people with money ... she herself was without money before so in the end she says if you are just a hard worker (like the girl who went to so many auditions with the fish) dont even try it is for the talented people to succeed now well and the ones who are famous or have connections. yikes folkes
this girl is going places, forever my Queen of Wolves. I love you &lt;3.
And here I thought I could not adore her more.
Great job
Lol I loved it but yeah what happen to that audience
I love this kid
Are there audience for real?
Maisie Williams on how to lose an audience in thirty seconds
Nailed it!<br>Whens your second ted talk
TÜRKÇE ALTYAZI GELSİN.<br>We need Turkish subtitles
I have just google her<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>She is good
Dead audience 😒 but I love her ❤
A girl has done well.
amazing, game of thrones vs dancing
Absolutely excellent! Would have loved to have been there.
I love this girl she is mine inspiration ❤
why do i feel like i just watched a commercial promoting an app?
The last four minutes really moved me because you can feel that what she achieved with that app makes her proud.
kids that&#39;s confidence
For gods sake stop she is giving a motivational speech not stand up comedy.. she is an actual warrior in real life
Yow people arya stark is standing in front of you ,pay some respect haaysstt
Should&#39;ve called it a NED talk<br><br>Edit- thanks for 700+ likes guys.
LOVE HER
Such a beautiful eloquently delivered talk
REFUSE TO HOLD YOURSELF BACK AND DARE TO DREAM BIG
ya.. let&#39;s take advice from someone who repeats lines others want her to say.. ya sounds smart
A better speech can be done by no one...;)
Title’s a little misleading, enjoyed the talk nonetheless.
I love Maisie!
Wow...@Marsie Williams, your story is very inspiring, thanks for sharing.
The half brother is John Snow
Amazing!!!
This was so interesting and engaging!
Her dance instructor remembers.
shes REALLY nervous i mean her hands are shaking
whats wrong with the  audience
I loved this... so inspiring
Despite the crowd, she kept going on and on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=118">1:58</a> Same, my parents divorced when I was months old too lmao
LA PUTA MAADRE LA AMO
Arya&#39;s Game Of Thrones is here OMG😮
¡No cualquiera entrena un ARTE 30 horas a la semana, mi más profundo RESPETO para ésta señorita!
What is the app called? I want to download it.
The girl became awesome ! She was already ! She was meant to be a star ! She was born a star &amp; not gabe up on her dream ! Wow did not know of app till today. She just amazing ! She is so cute !
After this she must have gave her audience the same wine to drink that she gave to the soldiers of house frey.
but seriously though, when <i>is</i> the android version coming? xD
I love you Maisie!!  😭😍😘
Fan of Arya stark from India. Is one there!!!!
CRINGE
Can i say thank God she didin’t pass that audition?
This is one the best TED Talks! 🔥✨
Who do they listen to? There&#39;s no one talking
As a 30 year old who has tried and is still waiting for her ship to come in, it&#39;s difficult to take advice from a young woman who got a big break before hitting puberty. I mean good for her but talent simply is not enough. :(
I wonder if the girl is talking to no one
Massie should be cast so you think you can dance ❤❤❤
a girl goes on stage a girl gives a good speech
So much love massie 💕
The audience was tough!!! No laughs at her jokes, no applause for her roles, mean!!!
So inspirational Maisie!
📷🎥💥❤❤❤
Strive to be no one
&quot;The lone wolf dies but the pack survives&quot; - collaboration
She is an incredible storyteller!
OK, this was surprisingly good and relatable. Definitely inspired, and I had no idea what the talk was even going to be about. I don&#39;t want to be an actor, a dancer, etc., but this talk still spoke to me. Bravo.
inspiring to be talented.........great
Thank you Maisie
This talk was amazing but I wonder how could the English spiking smart audience doesn&#39;t know the star of GOT...<br>And even when she introduced herself there was almost no cheers...
Valar Morghulis
Ted is scraping the bottom of the barrel.  ...And I&#39;m a huge GOT fan.
This is the longest ad for an app I&#39;ve seen
This girl is a true genius
I loved how Maisie came out on stage trembling, saying how surreal it was that she had been asked to give a TEDx Talk. Maisie then goes on to give one of the most sincere, eloquent, and down to earth TEDx Talks that I have seen. The girl with no name will have a very bright future! Badass!💙💙
I enjoyed this Maisie, and went to download the app, but couldn&#39;t find it anywhere. I look forward to version 2 hitting the app store. Android!
Very inspiring
one person&#39;s pain is another person&#39;s sunday afternoon.
Love her, respect her &amp; admire her. So open, vulnerable &amp; honest about her life. Lil Maisie living her best life. Truely blessed. I hope she keeps acting and or whatever her endeavours take her.
I want a daughter like her, and sofie turner
The North Remembers
And just like that I stan forever! Great motivational speech Maisi ❤️ I
That would be hilarious if she starting playing &quot;The rains of Castamere&quot; <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Everyone bolts for the exits</b>
An inspiring speech from a very inspiring young woman. I can&#39;t wait to see how our snowflake internet generation revolutionizes the world with our creativity and ingenuity.
Crush.
you are one of my favourite character, much love and respect to you...
A girl is very yummy
Maisie is an inspirational woman. As she has grown up, she’s taken nothing at face value and she has shown that you can do anything if you set your mind to it. Much love Maisie, you are an idol to so many.
I&#39;m sorry but the title doesn&#39;t make sense. You can&#39;t strive to be talented. Talent is natural. You can&#39;t make efforts to be talented.
Eek tough crowd
Amazing!!
Love her! 💖
I love her!
Thank you Masie! One of the simplest Ted talks yet so powerful in sending out a message. Talent gets you places. Self belief gets you places. Perseverance gets you places. TRYING GETS YOU PLACES.
Te amooooo
Misleading title, again.
bro that crowd blows
After years of faceless training, finally Arya Stark is on a TEDx Event
so inspiring ！
Нихуя не понял, но интересно
Wow wow wow this was SO inspiring!!
A girl knows how to sneatch my wig 👏👏👏
She speaks very good english.
這不是傳說中的艾莉亞嗎
shes talented.
hehe！
valar morghulis
valar morghulis
Syrio Forel taught her how to dance
I was thinking for a while what this girl reminds me. <br>Quasimodo - - Disney version! 😱
Subscribe
I am expecting Maisie will say <br>Iam Arya Stack of winterfill iam no One
Agreed, talent usually lasts longer then 15 minutes.
cant believe ted had a goblin on to talk.
I do not understand how her message of “don’t strive to be famous, strive to be talented” comes in? Did I miss it? It just seemed like she had a chance opportunity. At no point did she strive to be talented at acting. From the way she talked it it didn’t even sound like she wanted to be an actress. Someone convinced her to join acting and GOT was only her 2nd audition so at what point did she strive to be talented at it
Her app is an amazing dea, but I can&#39;t download it even after making a uk itunes. I would love to get some connections via the app, but I don&#39;t want to have to make 15 different itunes to test which one will let me download
I needed to hear this today! I am an actor on set right now desperate to find my next job and this filled me with so much energy.
Lovely...Maisie I wish you every success in the future in whatever you decide to do,...follow your dreams 💪
She thinks she is smart and talented by developing an app lol.
don&#39;t strive to be talented, strive to do what you love
Strive to be a faceless man
Cersei threatens 🔪 them to laugh in the pitch ! They are scary 😷
This was one long advertisement
Her accent is biritsh??
Manchester
Almost cried at the end! I admire you, Maisie Williams.
She is dammed good
Maisie is awesome.
TRUTH
Very inspiring speech. I needed to hear this.
Thank you! This is exactly what I needed to hear right now!
YES MAISIE
She is truly an inspiration.
The audience is so errr dead? There were so many parts to her speech where they could have clapped or cheered her on but they were dead silent. Ermmm why?
That is a quite long talk , yet inspirational ❤️
Is she on Addys or what lol
Talont can&#39;t be achieved by striving people are born with it. It&#39;s skills which can be honed.
Wow
I enjoyed the talk very much; well done.
The silence is not the crowd’s fault she’s simply not funny
The winter is coming
Jump to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=600">10:00</a> if you aren&#39;t interested in any personal life or GOT talk but wants to know numbers and unnecessary info about Daisie app<br>Jump to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=945">15:45</a> if you want to listen to her real TED Talk (yeah less then 1 minute of useful and inspiring words)
I wonder how many more unemployed and unhappy actors will result from this? There isn&#39;t room for everyone, even if they&#39;re talented. Nonetheless, she did a great job.
Strive to be Hard Working. Talent is God&#39;s gift. What we do with it is in our hands.
Great talk, but you were kind of in the right place at the right time don&#39;t ya think?
One of the worst ted talks i had ever watched.
Maisie is coming.
A girl is both famous and talented.
<b>Her British accent is soo on point</b> ❤
i didnt ecpect her to be that good....never ment to watch the hole thing but she got me...well done
Ted talk starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=930">15:30</a>
I heard &quot;I&quot; too many times. It should be used to introduce a very motivational speech and not and very long boring life story.<br><br><br>Ahn.. ye I am being too harsh but I really didn&#39;t get anything out from this other than her life story.
This message is to people like the Kardashians and wannabes
I love your speech so much this is so inspirational. Your talk is one of my favorite
a boy is in love with no one
That was amazing
I farted just as she stopped talking. This Rubish
&quot;Refuse to hold back and dare to dream big&quot;
Simply Superb Maisie you are fabulous
I love this girl!!
She‘s nice.<br>But that was a complete waste of time.<br>...I just finished typing that, when she mentioned Lady Gaga. <br>Wow.<br><br>I‘m off to find that one (out of 100, or 1.000, or 10.000) who believes in me.<br>What a great mindset!<br><br>(and I thought I knew them all)
Dont strive to be famous, strive to be born into a wealthy family.
Well presented thank you for sharing!
American crowd&#39;s are dead
A girl is talking to the army of dead!
ARYAAAAAAAAAAAA
my theory for the reason why the crowd sounds so silent is that the audio is clipped directly from her mic, which zones in on her voice and doesn&#39;t pick up the noise from the audience. only when they a lot of em laugh do you hear some slight laughter in the back
A girl looks so short
Very well spoken
I liked her in dr who
so far one of my most favorite Ted talk, love you girl!
i am cheeky, you are dead folks
A girl nailded it!
&#39;talent will carry you so much further than your 15 minute of fame&#39;!!!! Her transparency and raw speech is so admirable💜💜💜 you&#39;re inspiring thousands!
A girl has no name and her name is Maisie Williams...<br>&#39;Maisie&#39; meaning &#39;a girl &#39; and &#39;Williams&#39; meaning &#39;no name&#39;
She looks like Mr.Bean with pink wig
I love her. I needed this so much.
I just wanted to watch the first 2 minutes of her talking but didn’t realize that I was able to watch the whole thing and love it.
A girl is embarrassed <br><br><br><br><br><br>A girl is confident
I laughed so hard.  This ted talk is 🔥
Never watched a more useless Ted talk
That would be an amazing motivation talk for a 60 years old who still searching for his/her purpose and now it is time to have a great grave to go in.
Great Ted Talk!! :D
This is a plug lol
Winter came for TEDx Talks.
Why is the crowd so quiet?
Power of dreams.. supported by skills...
When a crowd of over achievers  wonder why this famous actress lost her way... They could have at least supported her more... Hope this doesn&#39;t discourage her from pursuing any academic development
Posh nonsense again
Amazing.
such an amazing speech.
A girl has a point.
The man likes this video.
Go girl go.
&quot;No One&quot;
Thank you for your speech and direction and inspiration.
No one knows how badass she is
I LOVED IT!!!.. Maisie Williams ......
Great to have this talk available! Thank you! Although, I do hope that when people record / tape / upload these talks they get the audio-levels right. Right!?!
I like her, I really do. Arya is my favorite character and I hope she makes it to the end. <br><br>But STRIVE TO BE TALENTED?!! Really?!! You either are or you’re not.  It’s all genetics.  It’s like saying strive to be TALLER.  Or Blonder. <br><br>You can say strive to be Successful.  Strive to be Happier.  But talented?!!!?
16 min long app pitch, want my money back
Trust that you are good enough.  👏👏👏👏
I saw Ashildr in the thumbnail and clicked
Massie is so right - have a dream and go for it, rise above unfortunate circumstances. Strive to be talented at what you do, not famous for what you do.
What&#39;s wrong with the audience...seems like no one knows GOT??? How is that possible
You people need your hearing checked - the crowd laughs quite often.
Bruh they need to record the audience
Shessss the bestttttttttt
Shes amazing! but whats wrong with the crowd? 🤤
Talent isnt something u get, its something u have. Now what u do with it, that another story.
So basically this was a 16 minute advertisement for yet another social media app?
It doesn’t matter what the crowd thinks people!!!! Her speech was good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It doesn’t matter what the crowd thinks people!!!! Her speech was good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Astounding!!! Ur personality is big and courageous ! I wish u good luck in everything you strive to become and create!
AMAZING!!🙌
Strive to be talented? You are born with talent. What you ought to strive for is excellence in your chosen field. Skill and craftsmanship need to be developed over time.<br><br>These celebrities keep getting dumber, and the audience is supposed to heed their advice just because they act on a poorly adapted TV series.
Bruh British crowd 😴
I don’t understand how the crowd wasn’t laughing??
Driven by curiosity, interests, love, and strive to do good/useful things for yourself/others/humanity. You will be more successful, peaceful with yourself, and happier.
so a ted talk about a stroke of luck?
oh sweet :)
Tough Crowd
Such wise words. Great speech! The crowd was energized but also keen to listen, it&#39;s not a fanfare or comedy show, it&#39;s a learning platform so those saying the crowd is boring should consider the event. Everything was great!
Ughhh I LOVE HER
im in love with her speech and message
This feels like a scene from a movie or something lol😂😂
the reference to the lady gaga quote hahaha
What kind of dead people is she talking to.....
Inspired
I agree don’t go after fame you won’t last long anyway go after doing the thing that you have a big interest in that you love doing every day learning about it doesn’t matter what it is but go after that mine is music 🎼
So much boldness yet theres softness in her.💜
Her app is just a take on Hit Record, is it not?
Love this so much ♥️
Similar to the prior TED talks, the speaker is Mic&#39;d which makes ot hard to pickup the audience sometimes. Some of those mics have a noise canceling ability also... LOL I was so uncomfortable watcjing this until I realized it 😂
I wish I was at this Ted Talk! YOU ARE AMAZING MAISIE! This crowd obviously have no sense of humour 🙄
WOW .. thank you so much for this !!
maisie williams literally just described my current situation in the creative industry. It&#39;s nice to know that someone with influence is trying to make it easier for someone like me to be able to work on something I&#39;m passionate about.
Maisie, you did amazing
I love you ❣️😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
tough crowd
I don’t want spoilers for the next season, please.
A girl is ready.
Anyone know where I can find that app? It sounds incredible!!
I needed this
I love her
Maisie is a girl to watch, excellent actress and visionary!  So proud of her:)
She’s f*cking amazing
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What a queen!!!! Love her!!!
I laughed at her joke then went back to hear them again because the crowd was dead silent and i thought i misunderstood something
this crowd is the worst...
why were the crowd so quiet....Maisie is really a brilliant and talented girl at her age or even beyond her age I think.
One of the best ted talks!!!!
HAHAHA she should stay acting and pretending to be someone else because she’s not funny at all.
Love and respect to this kid, I wish her all the best
My inspiration ❤️
Im still tripped up on the procrastination ted talk
thank you
Maisie Williams can like take my whole art :&#39;) 💖💖💖 This speech was awesome I really needed this ❤
Maisie has been my favourite actress since I first watched the series and Arya&#39;s my favourite character in GoT, and this Ted Talk only made me love her even more.<br>Such an inspiration!
&#39;Trust that your good enough.
Don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be talented
Winter is coming in April 2019
I love the drama in her speech
I want to open the transcript but I can&#39;t. Hepl me !
A girl has no name
AN AMAZING SPEAKER, SO ELOQUENT AND THE MESSAGE HITS RIGHT HOME
Your talk was amazing but your crowd was obviously was either star struck or had low blood sugar.
A girl is Maisie Williams and she is on TED
The Girls is Someone !
And Arya Stark takes the Iron Throne!  Of all the big names on that show, it was one of the youngest and brightest cast members without any previous credits to her name to get up onstage for this kind of talk.  She&#39;s a breath of fresh air for any of us creative types who struggle to find our way and often lose sight of how it&#39;s not the destination that matters as much as the journey to get there.  I can&#39;t wait to see how her career as a creative human being unfolds.  Valar dohaeris!
Many times I strive to be more like Hodor...
I love that Ted got Maisie Williams! She might have questioned why she was on there but it made complete sense to me when I saw the video pop up and I couldn&#39;t wait to listen.
Amazing
liked the video before even watching it, the title was pretty much everything I&#39;ve been thinking...
Guys they try to block out audience noise sometimes in post production, they could&#39;ve laughed when she was saying it live.
I  love Maisie Williams, I really do, but what she&#39;s saying is completely from the perspective of a famous person. I&#39;m a young person who<br>has gone to hundreds of auditions and never caught a break. At some point, doing what you love isn&#39;t about talent, it IS about who you know and what you have. She&#39;s saying all this from the perspective of a famous person who got her first gig from her second audition, which I respect, it just makes me a bit frustrated when people say it&#39;s just about hard work and talent.
you need to be famous to be on TEDx Talks.
SO inspiring!! I hope she achives bigger, better things.
Great job!
That was probably the most inspiring speach I have ever heard. I need to change something in my life and start striving for my dreams. Thank you, Maisie.
Wise girl!
general referencial joke....
🌸
This is cringe !!....... and yes, you can hear the crowd. They just aren’t laughing at much, and rightfully so.
Why did she say step siblings and half brother? Why not stepbrother or half-sisters?
Omg, I love her so much she said some real Sh@t !! Man and I believe she will be bigger then she is now.
It’s a ted talk, not a comedy show. Why is everyone expecting the crowd to laugh?
Actress to activist  dang
This talk was so inspiring. Growing up believing so much in meritocracy and the need for qualifications I never allowed myself truly dream, or allow my experiences to carry me. She became an Emmy-nominated actress without even wanting to be one. Now that&#39;s inspiring.
I think this talk has edited out the laughs... I don&#39;t think the crowd was so dead that not even a giggle  would come out of them
This crowd is dope
Are all Ted crowds dead?<br>Edit: sorry but WE CAN NOT HEAR THE CROWD, THEY ARE PROBABLY LAUGHING THAT&#39;S WHY SHE GIVES LONG PAUSES, BUT SINCE HER VOICE IS COMING FROM HER MIC. WE CAN&#39;T HEAR THE CROWD... HAHA NICE
Why she is overacting here !!
As someone struggling to figure out how to express myself creatively in such a competitive world, also being fairly young, this is really inspiring. My eyes watered a bit at the end because of how much I needed to hear this
what an amazing speaker she is
Heres the thing - you should strive to be famous. Because then you can show off your talent. There have been millions of talented people who have lived and died who never got to show the world because they didnt get the opportunity. Talented and unknown is useless.
She&#39;s incredible.
Why do you care about the crowd? omg, what she said is so interesting, in only one year my life has changed in so many different ways and opportunities that I reaaaally felt her. I only don&#39;t get why she used lady gaga for quoting lol please dont do that :&#39;(
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
lol my life seems pathetic in comparison xD being 21 and an award winning actress of one of the most famous shows on tv...while I&#39;m almost 26, living at home, and still unemployed..yikes.
Yeah, I cried
A girl has good jokes<br>A girl must not make jokes in front of a dead crowd
very inspiring.
This was a great TED talk. I should have been in that audience.
I would like to have a friend like her
She has the most captivating eyebrows.
im not a massive got fan but i saw the 1st few series,   i liked the scenes with charles dance
<b>She ran over me</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=102">1:42</a> oh god lmao
maisie williams is bloody brilliant
Wow, what a great talk!
i really needed this.
The comments right below mine are hilarious. I had the same thoughts: &quot;Tough crowd.&quot; (And she&#39;s FAMOUS! IMAGINE what the other Tedx&#39;ers must have been faced with.... then again, these events are really long days, so ... there&#39;s that.)
alguém poderia legendar em português, por favor???
Don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be a goblin.
She is hungry to get more exposure... pass.
People, you cant HEAR the crowd, it&#39;s their intention, they are probably laughing!
for anyone of you guys complaining about the audience not laughing. admittably most of her jokes were not that funny
She’s getting uglier every year
Thank you
We are similar
A man does not like the crowd.
Her delivery and resilience with a dead AF audience is awesome! 🙌🏼
Thank you Maisie! What an exceptional Ted Talk 😊
Go girl😍💓..
SHE HAS A TED TALK?! WHY AM I ONLY SEEING THIS NOW?!
BRILIENT i think I would make no noise and just listen because every word is important AWEAOME
Even better than just a life-changing moment, she&#39;s befriended her spiritual mommy, Julia Louis Dreyfus. Who on earth wouldn&#39;t wanna befriend this sweetheart Maisie? I would not be surprised if Julia was her babysitter on occasion.
Tough crowd 😬
Boring
I love her but I&#39;ll admit that I did not laugh out loud at any of her jokes :( Like many of you, you knew that it was funny, but something in her pitch just didn&#39;t quite land them properly. I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but my best guess is her delivery alongside her little mannerisms. She had great set-ups so she needed the punchline to be hard and fast; since you saw the ending, there was no surprise. Granted, that audience felt the same. It was meant to be funny and so it wasn&#39;t. And the audience is smart enough to know that. It&#39;s easy to watch this online and out of room where there lies no tension; especially when absolutely no one is laughing. It may have come to her that she shouldn&#39;t have opened with her &quot;famous&quot; you probably know me; and just started with something relatable. It put her on a high scale and well, the proof is in the pudding. All the same: her presentation and focus is inspiring, I don&#39;t know if anyone could have kept face. She did an amazing job recovering from no one laughing; I probably would have choked and gotten way nervous from the lack of reactions. Then again, she&#39;s very talented and I AGREE with every comment down below; as they actually laughed at those more than the video; thumbs up to you guys.
So... basicaly a Linkedin for Actors,  i like it.
can&#39;t stop laughing when reading the comments
Even Frost Giants are warmer than the crowd.....gees...
She&#39;s quite grounded, but surely she realizes what a HUGE role destiny has played in her life?
A Girl is funny 😉
She is an amazing speaker! Loved this! 💗
Trust that you’re good enough
Loved that she used lady gagas 100 people quote!!
Me &gt; Don&#39;t strive to be famous, hope to be in the right place, at the right time.
A girl is everything to me
Offer them all to red god!💀😵
🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️
Clearly this crowd was clueless. Sounds like a bunch of wet noodles.
Incredible talk!
Maisie is awesome! Hoping she doesn&#39;t get pulled into the leftist cesspool in which the majority of Hollywood actors seemed to enjoy floating.
The Lannisters send their regards!
She came to Southampton University to do this talk. We laughed at all her jokes.. haha
Almost 600 dislikes. PEOPLE WITH HORRIBLE LIVES I GUESS
The mic did not pick up the Audience voice or laughter. Don&#39;t worry about them being white walkers.
A message for the audience:<br><br>Shame.
Okay crowd, good luck dealing with no one after being so dead
So this is a pitch? Thanks sarcasm
Wow, was the croud dead. Did she poison them to??
would she be advocating this were she not famous 🧐🧐🧐
I thought how she delivered and what she covered was great. I do think the title could be adjusted to better reflect what she was talking about.
&quot;Refuse to hold yourself back&quot; - yes!
Maisie is an amazingly talented actress! And so wise for  her age...
This is amazing and inspiring :)
Why is she dressed like E.T in disguise 🧐
Love it!
This made me admire her even more. She gives great advice, and is so down to earth. We need more famous people like her.
that was actualy better then i expected it to be well done
This girl is doing amazing things with her oppurtunities
Oh god why is no one laughing oh no
Ooh this is skye
were the crowd awake? i am chuckling away at her jokes
I can’t find ‘Daisie’ in App Store :&lt; ‘this app is not currently available in your country or region’ lol I’m in Leicester
This was such a beautiful and inspiring talk. Maisie, you were amazing, as always. But, bloody heck, did the crowd forget to remove their earplugs?!
Wonderful speech!! Very inspirational!!
I want to show this to my students •_^
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
With respect to Maisie, I was looking for a different talk, a talk more related to the title, the content was not related to the title. She definitely has a sad story and a good project, but really, this isn&#39;t what the title is referring to, nor what she should speak about. Oh and by the way the crowd isn&#39;t dead, the crowd was just expecting something different.
A full theater hall full of cunts.
THANK YOU FOR THIS, YOU ARE SUCH A HARD WORKER , U DESERVE THE BEST, LOVED IT. YOURE SO TALENTED
I was in pain in for her about the Crowd!!<br>Man i was regretting for her of accepting this invitation!
Is this a spoiler for GoT like there is no reaction from the crowd... are they implying the White Walkers win.
That was a perfectly written and performed presentation.  Lovely to see Maisie channeling her success into supporting others.
A girl speaks and no one laughs.
I&#39;d rather be talented than be famous for a few minutes! I don&#39;t care if everyone knows my name, I just want to do the things that I love and am good at! No matter the cost! I want to be important, but still, I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m famous! If it does happen than cool, but if it doesn&#39;t, than I don&#39;t care! I&#39;m happy to be alive! I didn&#39;t find my true talents until I was between 8-18 years old!💓💓💕💕
NIght king have summoned audience
:(
She should visit Pakistan. People here laugh at even the lamest jokes 😂😂
inspiring speech
Winter is Coming !!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=869">14:29</a> Imp stuff!!
Wise beyond her years
So this is merely an ad. Disappointed. <br>She should be banned from Ted Talks.
Going to see her in New Mutants.
She&#39;s not outstanding. She just stands.
In defence of the crowd, I think they probably laughed a lot but the mic was not able to pick it up. Just listen to the applause in the end, it was almost as loud as her speech, which means they will have to laugh as loud as they applauded in the end to be properly picked up by the microphone.
I want the names of all the persons siting in the audience.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts Maisie. You did great. <br>People laughed appropriately; if they didn&#39;t laugh, it was because she&#39;s not trying to be a standup comedian; and the audience didn&#39;t find her that funny - - you can&#39;t fake laughter. But she got her thoughts across wonderfully.
The fact that she didn’t even get affected by dead crowd, this why she even better. Maisie is so adorable, if I ever have a woman like her in my life, who is strong, relatable, and has a sense of humor, woooooooooo let me marry that!
A beautiful speech, am super inspired 💥
Kim Kardashian left the chat
Were audiences&#39; reactions edited out or...? she is brilliant.
The crowd is so dead I start to think she&#39;s just talking to herself
Valar Morghulis
Can we just exchange the crowd already please??
Idk, but while she was talking about her early life with her mom and six siblings, I was picturing a medieval scene on my mind...  i just came back from that thinking when she said she grow up with internet.  lol<br>Anyway, great talk! Funny and inspiring.
Hola gente! Alguien sabe donde me puedo suscribir para Ted en castellano? Muchas gracias
Oy, the fashion sense of Angela Merkel, this one...
I&#39;m not crying 😭😭
Great speech
You know nothing John Snow:v
Beautifully told story. I could hear her talk for ages. 🖤
Ela não é &#39;ninguém&#39;, ela é Arya Stark e voltou pra casa pra sentar no trono de ferro!
It took me 3 minutes to realize that this was Arya.
At some point I actually wondered if there was any audience there! She&#39;s so sweet and funny, yet I heard nothing from them, what the heck?!
She is great brave fearless funny GoMaisie 👏👏
how are you so nonchalant in the description box about ARYA STARK being in da house????
The girl with no name  knows to talk. But the audience knew &quot;Valar Morgolis&quot;  so they denied to enjoy the speech.
Totally...Educate yourself.....
She is speaking both American and British accent?
This is a Ted talk not a Ned talk.
You got me crying again Maise, Damn
criiiiiinge
Wiw. That was Motivating :)
i wish i could tell my story and motivate other people ❤️
that frozen crowd tho
99% of comments: GOT reference as to how dead the audience is.<br><br><br>1%: IDK I just assume there is another type of comment.
Ladies and gentlemen ! Arya Stark of winterfell. <br><b>got theme plays</b>
Aside from the fact that the audience was dead. Her speech was very beautiful and inspirational and that&#39;s what&#39;s most important here. <br>When I watched this I was inspired get back up every time I fell down. <br><br>Kudos to Maisie!
This was a really enjoyable talk, but I just wanted to add on that: Yes, talent will carry you further than your fifteen minutes of fame, but hard work and persistence will also carry you longer than a lottery of talent and luck.
👋 nice talk! I have never seen or heard of you but I totally agree it’s crucial to strive for skills and talent, not fame. I love getting reviews and fan mail! But I’ll NEVER use my real name.<br><br>I don’t want to be known. I’ll make my difference without fame or fortune 🙌🏼
&lt;3 xxx Amayzing so inspiering
Damn this crowd was cold as while I’m giggling by myself, and is no one gonna talk about (A) how amazing Maisie is, and (B) how good that switch into the lady Gaga accent was and how good the accent itself was that was golden 😍 god we need more people like maisie, what a role model and a talent ❤️<br><br>Game Of Thrones is the greatest thing ever you can’t even argue 🔥
Honestly, if she was 15 years older the crowd probably wouldn&#39;t be able to shut up..  I feel like the crowd is dead just because she&#39;s young.  Sad how people treat young artist and entrepreneurs today, like they&#39;re all beneath them or not valuable all because they lack &quot;experience&quot; or some other imaginary trait.
was the crowd sleeping or what???
I loved her as Arya Stark, now I love you as Maisie Williams!! Great Speech !
I feel this so much. I’m an author and have written two YA fantasy books and have sent queries to hundreds of agents, all no’s. The industry picks not by talent but by what they think is a popular seller 😓
Crowd is full of Freys
Incredible shes a great role model for our children.
I am so inspired by this woman. I&#39;m not a Game Of Thrones fan but I saw her in Doctor Who. This has greatly inspired me. Thank you, Ms Williams, I will never forget this video.
I hope she reads these comments so she sees her jokes were hilarious and the crowd was just dead, we love you❤️💜💙💚
She looks like Eivor
why do all these ted talks start like : &quot;hey idk why im here&quot;.<br><br><br>i was hoping people had to earn a ted talk and not just thrown into one
This was phenomenal!
She is so smart and witty. Loved the talk!!!! if u read this Maisie i am also an arian and born on the same day as u r!!!!!!!!woahhhhhhhh.
99% of the comments are on the crowd not laughing.<br>1% on everything else.
Then can u explain the Kardashians
I really like her
Best 16 goddamn minutes of my life
Maisie ❤️❤️❤️
Stick too acting....lol tried to hard
She’s a fire actor
My queen...
So poised and well spoken!
i strive to be a reliable, hardworking artist who sticks to what i believe i deserve!
we play fornite fornite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YEEEEES MAISIEEEEEEE
Haha, got a Game Of Thrones ad just before this video
she has that attention seeker personality type! get out of here! so people in the comments want the crowd to laugh at her joking &quot;she will flip a finger to someone&quot; millenial s!!  I love arya stark the character! good talk misleading title!
Tough crowd
Get it Maisie!
Does anyone else feel like she sounds so weird like idk what I was expecting. Maybe I just watch too much GoT
Audience need to die
I think.... the creative world is not really creative anymore. It&#39;s more of a technical job now.
STICK EM WITH THE POINTY END!
Wow she’s good. Evoked a tear and laughs from me at the story of her audition - usually background music pulls that out of me but that’s cheap shortcut in a way.
If I were giving speech I would say goodbye under a minute
omg , this crowd is so dead
Im excited to get on this Daisie thing. Sounds so cool. :)
Amazing English
yeah wtf is up with that audience, she was great...mayby they&#39;re just a bunch of stuck up old people who probibly haven&#39;t even seen Game of thrones
Wow this crowd sucks
Like automatically
Beautiful talk! You are the big inspiration!
a girl did a fantastic speech
What&#39;s up with the audience? They seem to be some kinda ...dead or &#39;zombiefied&#39;?
Wow wth is up with the crowd
Her microphone doesn&#39;t catch sounds of the crowd very well, that&#39;s why it seems like they aren&#39;t interacting.
This is the funniest comment section ever !!
Great words very much needed today!
Arya stark forever
She sounds like Alicia Vikander
To the commenters below who loathe the crowds reaction, or lack thereof, it’s a Ted Talk not the Laugh Factory. Some (including me) did not find her jokes funny at all. Interesting nevertheless...
I was at this ted talk and it was the final talk out of 12 talks (it was a full day event) out of all the talks it was the weakest. The other talks were incredible and I was in tears for most of them, the topics touched people emotionally an created more of a reaction. Not saying this talk wasn&#39;t good but i remember just not being moved by it and also feeling quite tired after all the other talks
🖤🖤🖤
The cringe when no one laughs
A girl’s humor was not picked up 😂😂😂
Who&#39;s she?
She is amazing!!😍
lol use Flutter :)
Ted, I can not add not to include subtitles .. Do you want everyone to learn your language?) Why so?
Brava! Wonderful and inspiring Speech! Thank you for sharing your experience!
i got a game of thrones ad right before this wow
Cute❤️❤️❤️❤️
she is very well spoken
The crowd is terrible, I feel sorry for her 😅
ok but the problem is that i have no talent
she is not funny, people. it looks so fake
Rough crowd that day... rough crowd
Good TED talk!
Can’t stand rich people speeches regardless of their upbringing, I have my just reasons.<br>But this gave me goosebumps <br>Girl stay with us <br>Girl be good
Oh man I feel her struggle... I want nothing more than to just go to Berklee. I could only afford a few courses online and learned SO much during that time. But just because I don&#39;t have the money to invest in an education that makes me excited about what I do (film composing) I&#39;ve been stuck in my local university taking a general music program that I just despise. Sometimes it feels so unfair, the Berklee graduates get so many of the jobs in LA, there&#39;s always exceptions but it definitely is harder without a Berklee degree.
Much respect and admiration for this girl ♥️
What a fabulous speech by Lady stark ....i think audience was unable to understand her jokes they are pretending like Leinster😆
I want Tyrion Lannister to have a TED Talk, he is one of the best actors on GoT.
Talent is the root of the person. I believe talent is very important and it will help us to touch the goal on our life. Famous is just the result after that. Thank for nice 👍 sharing
i cant believe howdull the audience was... c was amazing.. up there
I love Maisie so much! But the audience was just so dead I cringed every time she told a joke and no one laughed.
This is Arya Stark when she steps into this generation. I have nothing but love and respect to this woman more of an actress but as person.
Good for you luvvy.
Her talk is more about upselling an app and less about importance of talent. Kind of disappointed an actor uses TED platform to advertise her business (despite her noble claims of changing the platform for actors - also which is not explained clearly)
Did she really just give a TED talk with advice to herself?
this is POWERFUL
I feel that it is down to luck and timing too. If she didnt go to that audition someone else would have got it but the main thing is she went.
...strive to be talented? Talent is luck. It&#39;s something you&#39;re born with. It&#39;s not something you can achieve.
The last 2 minutes were epic. Soar higher girl👌
Brilliant. And yeah. The crowd is dead. Sadly. She is amazing. Really needed to hear this.
Bravo maisie!!!!!! 💙💙💙Go Arya!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=704">11:44</a> WTH happened? Thye cut it somehow. Even her speaking flow is different. What did they crop out?? irruminarri lol
As a struggling artist, this brought tears to my eyes. I love this so much.
&lt;3
A girl is funny but A crowd is dead.....
Those fockin people got no sense a humor, honestly.
Love this girl so much!
The crowd seems to be Manchester City supporters.
&quot;Arya stark&quot; that the name suits on you very boldly.
Look at youu I&#39;m just proud of the woman you became ❤👌 Maisie you are amazing
I get that she has had an extraordinary special life compared to other people her age, but why should I care about her &quot;Life Lessons&quot;, when she is 5 years younger than me and for most of her life she has been rich as fu ck and entitled to everything..
There is no audience there, is there?
For a non native English speaker like me, I found her so full of sense of humor and I couldn’t count how many times I laughed at her jokes.
Refuse to hold yourself back and dare to dream big!  .... Maisie Williams
I love her, but tf is up with her hair?
She should admit she was only lucky
Even knight king&#39;s army would shout louder than this poor crowd..
Didnt she just study the faceless man?
Dead Audience
&quot;we are connected, aware..&quot; i beg to differ. we are the most disconnected generation since america was discovered :/
she s a horrible stand up actor
i am having a mid life crisis because maisie is just a year older than me.
i could never do a ted talk just because of the boring lazy dead crowd. like fr fr show a litle interest or something
a girl is targeryn
Gosh she’s so captivating❤️
she was in MANCHESTER !! I could’ve been there and be the one laughing at her jokes !!
oh boy is this awkward
I&#39;m guessing that audience is full of rich people that only know champagne, caviar, porsche and &quot;my summer house&quot; jokes. Every joke she made went right over their heads
The crowd sees no one
Maisie Williams? A girl has no name.
Maisie is such a wonderful light
this is probably one of the best ted talks
It always people talking about the crowd in the ted talk is &quot;dead&quot; ... Are you listening to her or to the crowd.. ?
Love her!!!
My mind is blown she’s an amazing speaker
A man is wise.
Wonderful Maisie, best ted talk i watched so far.
i leave my comment here, gonna watch it later.
For all the comments who say “the crowd sucks” etc. This is the atmosphere for pretty much all TEDTalks. The point is to let the speaker truly speak. She did amazing but I doubt the audience hated her or didn’t think she was funny 😊.
To all queen fans , why does she look like roger form the i want to break free video
Dead crowd ffs she&#39;s funny
What a crowd!!💀💀
dry crowd man. <br>on a side note, I&#39;m very excited for this app!!!
this talk is so beautiful.
I’m so like her 😂😍
1 minute silence for those who yet have not seen all 7 seasons of GOT yet
There was no crowd, I was there
tough room
An amazing young woman with an amazing message to all and an unfortunately horrible audience
that&#39;s what i always say.
bae asf
She is awesome. More interaction would of been great.
tvl proč mi každej TED zní jako šablona. Všichni používají stejnej story telling voice.
👏👏👏👏❤
for a tiny person you are so big!
Guys... Your comments are awesome !
They game is onnn is what I felt like
Love you Arya Stark
Dead audience
The worst part of any Ted Talk is the crowd
Lol.. This audience is not worthy of her Ted talk.
This make me fall more in love with u 😘😘 Arya ❤️❤️
the crowd is boring &amp; full of silence
Omg i adore her
Maisie Williams so inspiring
A ten year old girl is no one but ready to become some
dead audience for sure! lol
Amazing... speech.........
I love her so much. So inspiring
love her, what a great speech
Almost no one laughed BECAUSE they are not her age, they are not born in the same decade, and age has a lot to say for a persons humour. Now, stop whining people!
This is very inspiring!
I don&#39;t wanna be either fame or talented. I just wanna be rich 🤑.<br>Note : I am just replying to the title not for the video content
Punches as strong as the mountain and crowd as envy as joffery
The dislikes are all lannisters.
damn she really inspired me!
💙 Pakistan.
She is gorgeous. Bravo Maisie!
Her talk with always gonna be great, she is an actress which means memorizing a script she has written and making it fun and flow well.nice one :)
Im sooooo excited for GOT fffffffffffffffff
WOW SHE&#39;S REALLY A GOOD SPEAKER 💯❤
I would of walked off stage crying, dreadful crowd!
Okay I understand listening is important but guys, there&#39;s some humor in there that went unnoticed and that hurts. What&#39;s the point of listening attentively if you can&#39;t appreciate a joke? Were you even listening in the first place?
As an art student in my final year at university, I feel collaborating with other creative people would be a great way grow mine and other&#39;s work. I hope platforms such as Daisie become more common in this world. Creativity and talent are more important than people think
Is she delivering this lecture to wight&#39;s? C&#39;mon man react a bit.. she was doing a great job!
Why
I loved thissdjidjdb
thanks maisie, while listening to this poadcats, i had one of my best naps ever, woke up very rested and ready for resume my tasks for the day, you should do this more oftern, as for arya, i live in cyprus and i&#39;m sure she has boat sickeness so i&#39;m safe. <br>sheers !
She&#39;s an actor so do you think she memorized all that or what? I have adhd and could never get through a story like that lol
Don‘t strive to be famous, strive to love.
Poor girl, she was super funny!<br>Had better timing then most speakers.. but she had a super weird public😂<br>I think she did great
When the crowd is. Sitting and smiling.
a girl with no name speaks wisely
This is too painful to watch
A girl&#39;s talk is boring
She&#39;s amazingly authentic. Love her! Soo talented &lt;3
Listen up crowd, the stakes are simple. You laugh at good jokes or you&#39;re forever dead to me.
This girl is so funnnnnny, I  can&#39;t even!!! why is no one laughing :(
Crowd are mad because she&#39;s young and an actress. Snob much?
These comments bro 😂
this made me cry
A girl has a talk.
THE CROWD IS FUNNY
Tough crowd..
she is just like her fictional character in game of thrones.......This girl is genius.
“In a world where literally anyone can be famous, I hope to inspire people to be talented instead. Talent will carry you so much further than your 15 minutes of fame... Trust that you’re good enough. If there’s one thing that I’ve learned, is that there truly is a place for everyone... Refuse to hold yourself back, and dare to dream big.” Wow. Just. Wow. You are definitely an inspiration Maisie.
And as Arya Stark, she became that dancer.
How am I laughing yet this crowd is sitting in complete silence?
The crowd is weirdly silent.
que sotaque fofo
ugh i love her so much
just exactly what i need &lt;3 &quot; just believe you are good enough&quot;
You can strive to be talented, but unfortunately you can do nothing about it. Talent is just a gift by birth. You can hone your skill in your talented area.
This is so great, I loved &quot;talent will bring you further than your 15 minutes of fame.&quot; This is honestly one of the most inspiring things I&#39;ve heard recently!
At around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=206">3:26</a> or so you can visibly see her hands shaking SO bad :( This crowd was horrible to say the least...
A girl is Arya Stark if winterfell
at least shes honest lol
How come i am only watching this now...
Wow, really good talk! Congratulations to Maisie on all her success.
She is such an amazing, talented, and kind hearted young woman!!
I got a GoT game ad right before this :)
I was waiting for this to come out. She did an amazing job
subtle flexes but ok <br><br>jk
This young lady was placed in the wrong audience.<br>list the audience and banned them from TedEx next time
Tough crowd.. 😅 and u would think that they would get english humour lol don&#39;t worry Maisie, I laughed 😊 can&#39;t wait for the new season! 👍 X
I&#39;m just here to see everyone talks about Game of thrones😂😂😂
30 hours of dance a week.......how?
So inspiring, I wish I saw this when I was 10 or 11. I wanted to be an actress since I was 2.
I haven’t seen much of Game of Thrones, but she seems wise beyond her years.. Funny, intelligent, relatable; I hope she gives more speeches and I look forward to seeing more of her work! 😄
Lannister said &#39;if you laugh on Arya jokes , Lannister will sent their regards&#39; thts why the crowd is silent
Even the undead have more sense of humor than this crowd.
Maisieeee, my lovely little faceless gal!!!
When and where did this happen and how didn’t I know about this?
Maisie &lt;3
I tought it was Rogerina
This audience though is more dead than the Red Wedding&#39;s guests...
Welp... that seemed just like a boring version of a talk show interview.
She mentions she has a half-brother. Is her half-brother&#39;s name Jon, by chance?
I like Maisie, quite a bit, but it took her over 14 minutes to actually reach the point of her TED talk. The reason the audience was for the majority of the time quiet was because she was giving an autobiography and concept pitch that ended in a &quot;I guess this is where I give YouTube it&#39;s video title&quot;. It could have been an amazing TED talk. It ended up being a bit of a disappointment. Still, a girl&#39;s got guts. Mad props to her.
God, I hate this crowd
I feel so proud you&#39;d confuse me for her mother. Ugh!!
You have so much more authenticity than the average actors/actresses.  I greatly appreciate that.  Keep being yourself and true.
She was point on with the comment about it being easy to be famous, but harder to be talented.
that was a-maisie-ing
Have again seen another good side of &quot;a girl&quot;. Indeed, &quot;a girl&quot; has something to offer.
i really love  her but that hair are awful
there is too much to unpack here and im greatly inspired ...
Very well spoken maisie. You are a really awesome and inspiring human who I really admire😊
I  wanna see your talent in bed IN GOT s8    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Too old.
golema kotka, nema shto
Love her so much. I&#39;d be cheering in the crowd if I was there.
I think that the crowd don&#39; t respond cause she looks like she&#39;s playing. She don&#39;t seems natural at all.
The crowd is dead 😒
I remember Machio Kaku....This is how the new world&#39;s way of dumbing down process of becoming Celebrities..<br><br><b>Acting creating Celebrities culture...is this the future of humanity..... Thank God Audience was full of Lannisters...</b>
Love this.
A girl has a big dream
Loved this speech
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=879">14:39</a> chills. literal chills.
im so so inspired
One of the best TED talks that came from someone&#39;s heart and touched the core of my heart :)
We hear you Maisie.  You&#39;ll reach us, I promise :)
I think the audience&#39;s mean age was 95
Maisie is amazing, the crowd sucked
So cute..
dont be talented be famous <br><br><br><br><br><br>it was just a joke chill
wow, I&#39;m surprisingly pleased by her.
I&#39;m so proud of this girl👏💕
this is one big self plug im not surprised no ones laughing or anything. she says she watched ted talks but this is unlike any other, theres like 0 point to it
Public Speaking Skill: 100
meh
I’m Arya Stark from Winterfell and I’m going to TED talk
Not to sound crass but it seemed more of a plug for her new app.
So much wisdom from NO ONE
I have goosebumps. That&#39;s all.
Maisieeee doing a ted talk. Love her more now
Don&#39;t strive to be famous. Strive to be no one
Ashildr, Lady Me, Mayor Me, Arya Stark, call her what you will but Maisie Williams is a very strong personality in and by herself, without having to hide behind the characters she plays. And I find it irritating that some people are just not willing to think of her as a real person rather than a character in GoT or DW
Gonna need the red woman to revive this dead crowd❤️💀
Speaker nailed it. did her part well.. but crowd ...we need to have a change of crowd or listeners
I just love her!  Smart, driven, talented, and adorable. She quickly became one of my favorite actresses after her &quot;a girl has no name&quot; performance. Fantastic young woman &lt;3
The crowd is so dead.
I needed this today
Wow...this was just, mind bendingly extraordinary.<br>I had no idea she was so good in storytelling, it was like a novel!<br><br><br>&quot;Refuse to hold yourself back, and dare to dream big.&quot;
Strive to be no one
So all she did was promote her own company/app?
Okay Arya 💪🏽⚔️👍🏽
Guys the crowd isn&#39;t dead, most of those suicide jokes are only funny online or with people who you know properly. These jokes don&#39;t belong in a ted talk, they&#39;ll get no response
Love this girl but why does she keep walking out of the red mark
Good thing you have good audiences here in youtube.
We Need Theon Greyjoy to do a TED talk and get knocked out right after
Beauty with Brains period.
I don&#39;t understand why people criticized the audience just because they didn&#39;t laugh at her jokes Simply it wasn&#39;t impressive enough Many people praised her but in my view her life is her choice and how it is bad or good is up to her There&#39;re many people out there is struggling with their problems and they get over it.And don&#39;t tell your problems everyone has their problems Give people what they wanna get from your experience in a logical, clear way
Dare to dream, big.  Love ya, Ms. Mais!
So why she is on social media all the time? <br>Brilliant actress though.
A girl with no name is girl who knows Everything about Dreams to come true.👏👏👏
Love you, Arya &lt;3
A girl is Maisie WILLIAMS, the last born of 4 siblings
A girl has grown up
I got goosebumps all over! Also, the jokes were great but the crowd was so dead. Where&#39;s your sense of humor people???
Amazing young woman.  People double her age would find it hard to stand on a stage by themselves
Smart, talented, down to earth woman. Adore her
inspiring! thank you Maisie
Amazing ❤️
Damm Maisie Williams is soo hot
white walkers are the audience
She deserves a better crowd than this.
Those ending words &lt;3
A wonderful talk!
She is cute
I really really like this! ❤️
I admire her for sticking out for her dreams. I want to be an actress too but because of the Asian traditions and cultures that I have to live by, I cannot pursue it when I really want to. My mom keeps on telling me that this industry is too risky and that my acting and dancing and singing and modelling should just be kept as a hobby and nothing more. I understand her point of view but just growing up with all these negative comments thrown around dreams, just shut it all down. Now I spend my days stuck inside my room with the blinds shut studying my life and soul away. I want to tell my mom I wanna quit school and go to a stage school or something or just get out of this hellhole I live in (sorry hk ppl but we really do live in a hellhole) but I would never have the guts for it. Sigh
Her accent sounds so similar to Alicia Vikander at the beginning IM SO CONFUSED
Maise you are the best!!!!!!
When the teachers says :&quot;No, you can&#39;t be anything you want&quot;. Meanwhile Arya Stark is everyone and no one
A girl has many faces
Easy for her to say..given millions of money in her bank account and the Instagram followers
love her she is so right! lol find me on daisie @sarahrue lol I&#39;ve been on since the beginning!
No one is wise
Trust that you&#39;re good enough. That&#39;s everything &lt;3
You of whom has no humor will be next<br>Liam<br>Emma<br>William<br>Ava<br>Logan<br>Sophia<br>Mason<br>Charlotte<br>Oliver<br>Evelyn<br>Lucas<br>Harper<br>Alexander<br>Elizabeth<br>Daniel<br>Sofia<br>Aiden<br>Madison<br>Joseph<br>Victoria<br>Samuel<br>Grace<br>David<br>Camila<br>Wyatt<br>Riley<br>John<br>Lillian<br>Dylan<br>Zoey<br>Gabriel<br>Aubrey<br>Isaac<br>Lily<br>Jack<br>Eleanor<br>Levi<br>Luna<br>Joshua<br>Brooklyn<br>Lincoln<br>Zoe<br>Ryan<br>Hazel<br>Nathan<br>Paisley<br>Isaiah<br>Skylar<br>Charles<br>Claire<br>Josiah<br>Aurora<br>Hunter<br>Anna<br>Jonathan<br>Caroline<br>Landon<br>Aaliyah<br>Blank Hero<br>Cameron<br>Allison<br>Theodore<br>Sarah<br>Hudson<br>Adeline<br>Easton<br>Ariana<br>Nicholas<br>Gabriella<br>Colton<br>Alice<br>Brayden<br>Hailey<br>Dominic<br>Emilia<br>Ian<br>Quinn<br>Elias<br>Piper<br>Greyson<br>Serenity<br>Ezekiel<br>Everly<br>Evan<br>Kaylee<br>Bryson<br>Aubree<br>Cooper<br>Eliana<br>Parker<br>Melanie<br>Jason<br>Isabelle<br>Chase<br>Valentina<br>Gavin<br>Clara<br>Kayden<br>Reagan<br>Jameson<br>Madeline
I love you Maisie.
Proud of you! That&#39;s all I have to say.
Maisie don&#39;t die in season 8<br>Multi skilled girl.
Now, she will tell
Welcome to my tedex talk
She’s kind of annoying
So good speech... But no laugh. Is it sound editing issues???
She&#39;s kind and sweet and talented. It&#39;s a great tedtalk
I wonder what WWE would do with a crowd like this XD
I liked Jack gleeson speech more
Go Maisie! ❤️🌠
The North Remembers
I wish it was strive to be skilled, I feel like talent is a loaded word
So confident, I liked her and her ideas🖤
A girl is going places 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
what you know or who you know 🙏
The future&#39;s bright with kids like these
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=890">14:50</a> she’s right but wrong because there’s ton of talented people but they always choose people with the right look with some talent
I wish you were around when I left art school and uni when I was late teens early 20s. I&#39;m 36 now. I work as a legal secretary and I enjoy my job. I feel as though if I had a creative support network at that time in my life I would have felt listened to. It&#39;s hard from a working class background. Sometimes you just assume that you or your family can never afford certain privileges to get heard.   Some of the more confident artists in college came from families of rich artist parents. I later found out my dad had an opportunity to do a creative role but he turned it down for a normal working class job as a mechanic. It&#39;s something inbuilt from certain backgrounds I can&#39;t explain it. I&#39;m support your thinking Maisie. Thank you!
Poor choice of words in the title. Talent is innate. You can&#39;t strive to be talented if you don&#39;t already have it.<br>It should instead be &quot;Don&#39;t rely on fame, rely on hard work and the talent you have (if any)&quot;
She&#39;s an inspiration!
The Kardashians are talented at being famous
I don&#39;t watch game of thrones hence I didn&#39;t watch this video
Can you please tell this to Kardashians?
What a stuffy audience. Girl&#39;s got jokes and audience is f-ing dead!
💜💜💜
That was kind of brilliant.
there was a reason i came here.... thank you Maisie!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽✨
Maisie Williams<br>Mais=Corn<br>Cornie Williams
that lady gaga joke though
Honestly from one of my favorite actresses from one of my favorite show telling me something I need to hear and probably many others. This spoke to me on so many levels and I&#39;m just so happy this popped up in my timeline. I need to watch this for a few weeks!
The crowd is so cold wtf. If I saw Maisie in real life, I’d be freaking out
A girl is smart.
Wow! Dare to dream big
Amazing 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Im literally so close to sheading a tear
Another one of those amazing castings from GoT.  How have they done that?
The reason i love short girls
Maisie is such a gorgeous soul and a wonderful role model. Love her and a great speech
You hair, pls. Dont ever go to a Tedx again. You are a valuable person.
omg this audience is horrible, what are they, some uptight vegan peta feminazi?? News flash not all TED talks are suppose to make you cry and activate your bleeding dead heart
I&#39;ve seen many TEDTalks and boy, is this my favourite
You guys need to mic the audience jesus
It&#39;s annoying me that everyone on Ted thinks they have to be animated and over expressive to keep attention.. I&#39;d have loved to hear her talk in a relaxed format when she wasn&#39;t having to act it all out like lines from a script.
LET HER BE BILY ELLIOT, GOD DAMMIT!!!!
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
what a decent human
Who strives to be famous? That&#39;s self centered. We just don&#39;t want to worry about money so we can concentrate on family and life
Loving all this GOT references to the crowd
A girl is brave, A girl is smart, A girl  is right. THE THINGS SHE DID 🐺🐺🐺🐺
Darn. Never expected to have so much in common with a &quot;rich kid&quot;, having been a dirt poor kid myself...
Ela parece ser tão legal
Well said. As a writer, I very much appreciated your words.
This talk is really important! This way you won’t need your parents to bribe your way into an Ivy League college
Dare to dream big!💓 Your words got into my heart, thank you Maisie💓💓
Maisie is full on fabulous. I would re-name the video &quot;Maisie introduces Daisie app for connecting/ empowering new artists.&quot;
she is so inspiring
&quot;In a world where literally anyone can be famous, I hope to inspire people to be talented instead &quot; - words for dreamers to live by
I&#39;d like to believe they are laughing out loud, without possibly disrupting the speaker thanks to  the obvious yet bizarre  audience voice noise cancellation thing they got setup in TED x venues.. haa haa!!
I cried. That’s really inspiring, especially for me right now. Thank you, Maisie
Can I pour wildfire in the pit now ? This crowd needs something to warm them up
Knowing she wanted to be a dancer makes the scenes where she’s Dancing with Needle more meaningful! And I can’t believe no one even chuckled at her jokes! She already felt unsure of herself and this crowd didn’t help
She&#39;s a great speaker
Seriously though, when will the android version be coming?
Stop bagging out the crowd, they ask you to be silent in a TEDx talk.
She is so sweet I just want to hug her honestly!
It&#39;s awesome to see a person who is as optimistic as I am talking about things I now am doing aswell. Everyone gots talent, but you need to learn for it. Learn, ask questions, don&#39;t be afraid, become smarter, do things you never though you could untill you do it,... Today you see too much negative talk and stuff, but with working together we can build great things. And our future lies in our own hands.
She&#39;s brilliant and lovely. She&#39;s gonna do great things💕
I want to see her dancing!!!
THIS SPEECH WAS VERY NEEDED!
The girl is ready..
Well I&#39;m talented and not famous. So what&#39;s the point of that?
The comment section is killing me😂😂😂
The crowd is dead
this crowd stinks
&quot;Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe. When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. .
To be honest I came here because I thought this was going to be a cool talk and cause it&#39;s Maisie but I stayed mostly for Maisie, this was basically a motivational speach it was good i really liked it but that&#39;s not what Ted talks are suposed to be about
360 Kardashian fans disliked this video
If was there I&#39;d die of laughter, for real. That audience is deader than I am inside.
A girl with multiple talents... The man likes him..
She is such an inspiring yet genuine speaker!
This was sos so inspiring!<br><br>Update: I&#39;m low-key tearing up
Wow
Tough crowd. Obviously none of them seen Game of Thrones yet
this speech has brought me so much joy, thank you maisie
She look like she could be the real life luna lovegood (yeah that&#39;s the only i tought just by looking at her )
Toughhh crowd
&quot;Refuse to hold yourself back, and dare to dream big.&quot; Powerful words I must say! I wish I had the strength and resolve that Maisie and people like her possess. The fact that she had a very rocky start to life, gotten to where she is now, and she is still going strong is quite admirable to say the least. I really don&#39;t know if I could ever measure up to someone like Maisie. Heightwise definitely, but in terms of her accomplishments at such a young age, regardless of the fact that it was down to pot luck and timing, as well as her grit and determination, not in a million years could I even dare to hope of being her equal at the very least. <br><br>To me, Maisie Williams and people like her are the spark of hope that this world desperately needs, especially in it&#39;s darkest hour. Of course simply elevating her to the status of an idol or deity would undoubtedly be rather detrimental not only for herself, but also to those closest to her (i.e. colleagues, friends and family), as well as those who admire her. After all she is merely an individual, who can only achieve so much with the time she&#39;s been given, just like the rest of us. I do hope though, that future generations will see this video, draw inspiration from her words, thus push themselves to dream big like Maisie.
&quot;Kabil bano kabil..kamyabi jhak marke peechhe aayegi&quot;. Omg Arya is following  Rancho 😂😁😁
No cheer when she mentionned Game of Thrones?!?! What kind of crowd is this??
Quite awkward when she tries to be funny and the camera pans out but no one laughs.....
Very inspiring! Thank you 😊
A girl spoke well. And a girl needs to put the crowd on her list.
More love to your way ! “No one has a face now “ 🤗
&quot;In a world where literally anyone can be famous&quot;<br>I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a long time. Talent is not needed anymore, all you have to do to be famous is to be born, basically.
I can relate to putting on your favourite album and dancing all the hurt and stress away when life gets rough. If you&#39;re someone who&#39;s going through something right now, turn to something like this to help you feel better please! I really hope it works with you, too. Just forget about everything for half an hour to an hour and dance to your favourite songs. I promise it&#39;ll make you feel better
british people so boring.....maisie gave humorous comments....but got liitle laugh from audience
Inspiring how she&#39;s overcome FAS.
We&#39;ve grown to love Arya and now we got to know who Maisie is. I see where the character manifests inside her. She will always work hard at the youngest of age to know who she was and what she wanted to do
felt ma self alive 👌 in addition that ur an actress , activist, enterprineur ,,ur also an inspiring ted talker 😍.
Nice speech...I liked it
This crowd is deader than a white walker with valyrian steel
Thank you very much for your beautiful words!! I know it comes from your heart!!😍
I hate the fact im distracted by her outfit when her speech is so great ooof. And why do i feel like the crowd is looking down at her like shes nothing? People gotta stop judging her for being a village girl or because of her &quot;beauty&quot; doesnt meet their standard. Smh
All the dislikes are from Lannisters and Freys
💗💗💗💗
It’s easy to say it when you are a famous actress since you are a child and most probably you won’t have economical problems and unemployed. Only if she really fucks it up everything. If you have talent and you don’t have money you won’t be able to prove it.
Pretty good talk. One of her point is wrong though: the industry does not always select people based on talent but on looks or favors.<br>As evident by the too many amount of working actors with zero talent but they look hot so...
Aaw maan I feel for her. I can see how nervous she is when the crowd was not reacting at all. She was saying good things but the crowd is just dead.
I think she is the jolly girl from the movie then came you...
WOW
Tough crowd
This is probably why GRRM likes her so much.
Right, cause Vincent Van Gogh’s life was so great
The audience dead
Just what I needed to listen in this moment of my life
Tough crowd
👏👏
She learnt at a very age that &quot;fear cuts deeper than sword &quot;
I wanted to be a ballerina. Now I’m a Bravosi Water Dancer.
I laughed so hard at Lady Gaga quote.... xD<br>if you know what I mean ;)
Downloaded the app. It does have some bugs. Glad to hear the update comes out in April. As a person who has always loved the entertainment business this app could be amazing. My life long dream ever since I was a little girl has been acting.
Man the crowd is awful to her
This is so inspiring.
It&#39;s sad when you strive to be talented but you are not talented or trained enough and you are no longer 10 y.o.
The crowds are definitely white walkers
This crowd is full of dead men
Valar Morgulis
Studying in Manc rn, for the longest time she sounds/looks like my seminar teacher who’s doing a phd XD
How exactly do you STRIVE to be NATURALLY gifted at something?
A girl has pink hair
Good job girlie!!! Well done
Damn..I loved the speech.. such a talented girl.. its a dream to work with her some day in some film..
Love Maisie. Love the talk. Hate the outfit.
Hard crowd..
Arya!!!
wow i just witnessed a whole new side to maisie and i LOVE it
She&#39;s a good orator but this audience was shiteeee
one of the best ted talks comment sections.
The crowd did not laugh on that Lady Gaga Joke? Shame
&quot;No One&quot; did TED talk like no one ever did...
The number and quality of the comments based off of GOT is both staggering and hilarious. 😂<br>Nonetheless, she&#39;s an inspiration
Just luck really
Coincidence much? How this come up today as where celebrities over here paid money for their kids to attend colleges without any talents
I am 55 years old, and can relate to Maisie. I am still holding on to a dream that I will sing again...professionally!
here is a better one. strive to be happy.
Imagine being the girl with the pet fish 😂😂
She is amazing... beautiful, wise and talented! I sometimes forget she isn&#39;t the little girl from GoT. She is fantastic.
Is she giving the speech to all the White Walkers??  She was very good and yet the audience are so silent.
Spoiler alert: you are either born with talent,<br>or you aren&#39;t. You cannot strive for talent. But you can develop skills through hard work.
This caption is a tight slap to tik toker
Luck is the most dominant factor in the life of most people, she is clearly an example of having lots of luck.
She owns the Throne.
Over time TEDx talks got repetitive. Glad that Maisie Williams made a change. Arya has come a long way in reel life as well as her real life! Loved it.
I love u Maisie ...... one day I may come to London to meet you. LOVE from India.
What a wonderful surprise
That was very inspiring  and wise
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=103">1:43</a> oh, man. that was painful
Yaazz Maisie Yaazz!!
She should have come on stage and say:<br><br>Hello! I am no one
You cant strive to be talented.
A girl has a good vocabulary, a girl can speak better than kill
As an introvert this was an amazing talk from the girl with no name
A man does not watch Ted Talks.
so cute!
What an inspiring talk... so honest and from the heart.
There are actors and actresses that fall into oblivion after discovering success. You can tell that she&#39;s not one of those people satisfied with what she has achieved!!
I have a migraine but I still decided to click even though the screen light is killing my head lol
Wtf did she do to her hair?
Don&#39;t try to be famous, try to be skilled*<br><br><br><br><br><br>Didn&#39;t even watch the video (not going to). Saw this in the recommendations and came here just to comment and let y&#39;all know, talent and skill are two very very different things.
A really beautiful speech❤️
I see “No one”
why i found all the ted talk so mechanical...is all the talk is scripted?????
What&#39;s up with the crowd?
I’m touched so touched &amp; inspired by her work ethic. Her drive
Was this a commercial for her app?
She is a good actress and a talented public speaker in my opinion
How inspiring! Bless u maisie.
Best ted talk I’ve ever heard
for the crowd in Manchester: SHAME! SHAME ! SHAME! the crowd has no name.
Thank you for this!
Is there even a crowd watching?
It&#39;s easy for her to say don&#39;t want to be famous she is
SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE 🚨
Go Maisie!
The lannisters and others are the one&#39;s disliking this video
The girl that wanted to dance works with &quot;dancing masters&quot; as Arya. That must have been fulfilling for her to play
So English. 👌🤓
I&#39;ve fallen in love with this project, I wish you succeed with all my heart. That is a really hopeful and amazing project! Good Luck!
It gives me anxiety everytime she goes out the red circle haha. But of course it didn&#39;t take away the fact that I love her content and the way she delivered her talk. Such an amazing woman! Love you Arya! ❤️
i need to see Lili Reinhart here
Hardly any sound is coming from the audience. Are you sure they are not white walkers and wights?
I take advise from no one.
Bgt n agt. You need to be famous
I&#39;m at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=108">1:48</a> and she lost me
Couldn&#39;t help feel that this was a bit of a brag fest.
Go go Maisie! I hope Arya will end up on the Iron Throne!
A girl is making me so proud!
The crowd must be lannisters or what
I love a smart girl. I feel like crying
I was in the audience and although I love her, I have to tell you her jokes were not making an impact when it was live.
this one is going to break the 30 million views!
and that&#39;s why you are not famous.
Ooh. Tough crowd.
I wanted her to kill everyone inside the hall at the end of the video with line &#39;Tell them winter came for boring crowd&#39;
Absolutely brilliant talk!
I see no one there
😘😘😘😘👍👍👌👌really inspirational....
❤️
Is it scripted ?
Ok creature
A girl killed the whole crowd after the talk
I thought it was an interview of the new season game of thrones
i dont know why i cried. what am i even doing here? i wish i had dreams as a kid.
I feel that as far as the “no formal qualifications”, makes me feel talent-anonymous
Yes Arya!!!!!!
This audience needs an a$$ kicking..boring lot
A crowd of white walkers ?
It&#39;s lovely how she&#39;s went past the stage where we feel insecure about our features and adapted to them.
Is this stadium or whatever it is called empty???
Ay it’s so cute she did this
<b>insert Game of Thrones/Arya Stark reference</b><br><br>GEEZ...what is wrong with this crowd?!!<br>&quot;I was alone in my own head and I felt the most ALIVE.&quot; I relate so strongly to that as an artist...
hey maisie, i know you see this
When I heard her speak for the first time at Warwick, my faith in this world was restored. (Seriously, I had been dealing with depression and the thoughts of why there is nothing right with this world were daunting) Being satisfied is possible when we enjoy our strengths and values. Fame and money don&#39;t get you any satisfaction.
great crowd....,    as  always....<br>she tells  her achievements...    yet..,  no claps?     WTF?
If you look closely the crowd isn&#39;t real and she&#39;s talking to herself on a stage.
Who&#39;s the guest? Coz I see No One
And people think she did the show because she needed a laptop
Thank you for talking. You are a hero
I see no one. No one is there. I just hear a voice.
I hear Miranda
Brilliant
maisie williams face looks like face of hunch back of notre dame
Amazing
funky hair color
&quot;I felt alone in my own head, and I never felt more alive.&quot; Reading gives me this feels.
Youre a great public speaker maizie!!!  Very endearing and captivating! Loved it
Danaerys who? I only know Arya Stark, the actress, the entrepreneur, the activist
i think the crowd is dead
A man liked it
Huh? wait... ah. Never mind.
“Too young and naive to feel inadequate” truer words where never spoken about childhood dreams and fantasies. So proud of how she grounded herself and followed the opportunities that came her way and let it take her on a journey that could bring her joy and fulfillment.
That Ted talk was inspiring.
Is it just me or the name of the video is misleading?<br>So far her story pointed out that nobody paid attention to her talent but found her suitable for a role.<br>I really was interested to listen in her experience.<br>In the end her message is not the tittle of the video but there is always a place for everybody where they will find to belong.<br>Sweet... I wish that would be true.
A girl has many gifts
A girl speaks wise words but words won&#39;t kill cersei.
Was she in Harry potter
please give subtitle
Also the MVP she mentions only learning about 6 months ago refers to Minimum Viable Product for those who don&#39;t watch HBO&#39;s Silicon Valley.
When I saw you first time in GoT. Really I inspired you. No one can replace you.
There were 3 parts that were hardest for D+D to cast on Game of Thrones for characters there from the start first season and still there at the start of the last. The first is Tyrion Lannister played by Peter Dinklage who was offered the part. The second is Jamie Lannister played by  Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, the Third is Arya Stark played by Maisie Williams. More than luck and timing.
she&#39;s such a weirdo, I&#39;d like that.
No one made this speech...
Wow fantastic talk! Very inspiration and refreshing.  The crowd is tough but she is tougher. Didn&#39;t take no for an answer!
I love you so much Maisie
二丫说什么都是对的
Arya stark from GOT challenging speech.... love it..
Very inspiring 😃
She just spoke to my soul. Wow I love Maisie
Dead crowds. She must have murdered all the audience before she spoke and played applause audio recording after bidding that thank you.
Who&#39;s daisy
You’re the best maisie🍎
this is amazing talk
Thank you for your inspirational story❤
Not funny but very inspiring. Surprising.
Trust that you are good enough and ask questions
a girl now has a ted talk...
Thank youuuuu for thisssss
That crowd will end up on her list of names.
the crowd is so dull! her speaking is very amusing
That&#39;s the spirit.
really tough crowd, but great presentation and insights!
&quot;Oysters, clams and cockles!&quot;
Hey it&#39;s Arya
‘The Hound would like to know your location’
<b>NOT</b> <b>TODAY</b>
Starks would proud of you girl no one
What a dull audience
But you are both
Oh how i would like to be friends with her
Arya Stark talking for a wight crowd
The crowd needed a bit more alcohol
On artistic talent getting snubbed by gate keepers, Seth Godin: &quot;Don&#39;t wait to be chosen; choose yourself.&quot;
A girl has spoken. <br><br><br><br><br>Cerise Lannister has left the chat.
She&#39;s funny and cute. I think I&#39;m in love
Such an inspiration. My favourite actress!
Great speech
I’ve never want to be famous.
I just simply Loved it 😍😘❤️🤗♥️
Wow so anyone can do this.
Seven blessings to you my lady
Who is here because you love Jung Guk, too and you are Army? <br><br>Nice speech!!
How do you strive to be talented if you have to be born talented
Hope you succeed in whatever you do  .Lots of love, Maisie ❤
Wow! Captivating and encouraging
The crowds are not dead. <br>Well, its weird seeing no-one on the stage
No One is beautiful 😌
I LOVE HOW SHE REFERS TO LADY GAGA FOR HER WORK 😊
A girl is a good speaker....
I could listen to her all day 😍
Tell that to the Kardashians
A good talk, but there were no jewels of wisdom here.
“Stay on the circle” my compulsive obsessive mind
She is introducing her product still there is no link to her creation (platform) ...??? Step up your game Ted X!
ARYA STARK - NO ONE
Maisie❤️❤️❤️
The Man has no idea who&#39;s this young lady !!<br> &quot;she&#39;s not A STARK anymore &quot; .. 😢😢
😍😍😍😍
Don’t be famous because everyone know you. Be talented so everybody adores you!
SO inspiring. Thank you TEDx Talks and Maissie.
Made me cry
I love her and GoT!! This speech is great
I&#39;m proud that Maisie had her Ted talk. But most of the audience dosen&#39;t know her. I hope she started her speech by introducing herself like her age, her achievements, her advocacies. I just hate that people didn&#39;t get her jokes.
What a bright kid!
Famous? A girl should strive to be no one.
That first part was a little cringy but I&#39;m glad she got her groove
I think the audience doesn&#39;t know her.
253 people are Lannisters
What a lame crowd
Lucky girl, good for her!
a girl is starting new business!<br>I wish her all the best &lt;3
But who are the Killjoys that disliked this show? I want to think they did it for the fun and not really mean it.
Valar morghulis
Ok the talk was great but she looks like an Oompa Loompa
Cute as always!
In other words, do what is meaningful, not what is expedient.
Oooh my gosh. I had no idea that this was going to move into product development AND content creation/collaboration. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
I&#39;m glad I saw this tonight!...<br>😊
she is genuinely adorable
A girl spoke wisely
How do you find out you’re doing a Ted talk?<br>When do I suddenly find out I’m doing a Ted talk, should I be worried.
People wonder why the crowd no on laughed at her jokes. TED talk crowd are a little bit different than normal people.
What&#39;s the App called? Anyone know?<br><br>E: Nevermind she said &quot;Daisy.&quot;
Or &quot;skilled&quot;, perhaps? Talent is innate; skill can be learned.
Loved the way she showed humbleness, that she&#39;s just like the rest of us and made it to succeed. And why people didn&#39;t laugh at her jokes??
the crowd is filled with white walkers... like they are literally dead!
Her half brother = Aegon Targerian
Did I just hear a laugh? No? Ok.
Lovely girl ♥
a girl can talk a girl ted talks
Lots of respect for her.
The joke in the beginning fell flat af
Aryia Stark ✨✨
Her introduction is highly ispired by J.K. Rowling’s speech at Harvard. It makes me uncomfortable almost. Feels like I have traveled back and forth in time. She is cute though.
Brilliant Maisie, well done.
Strive to defeat the Night King
She is fabulous xxx
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=84">1:24</a> what a self centered intro, just get on with it!
BEST TED TALK EVER!!!
Inspiring.  Just inspiring.  Well done Maisie.
Not once in my life have I ever desired spotlight for any other purpose but to see me getting comfortable with myself. Fame is overrated indeed.
Love this so much
There is no one speaking, wtf.
Her character in GOT is my favorite out of them all.
The man needs the name of the boring audience.
Oh man.. this is something that every kid nowadays should watch and learn
So inspiring!
❤
A girl is no one no more. A girl is very talented and clever. A girl is Masie Williams
We don&#39;t deserve her.
She did such a good job. This crowd were dead though!
From the world of dragons to the world of cows ( audience)..<br>What a journey
I will watch this video just to improve my English..
When actors expect a noisy audience as they do and then they happen to find this.... reality check
Valar Morghulis...
So great!
She’s amazing! But the crowd is absolutely terrible!!!
Great talk, awful audience
Thank you Maisie.
Bring on the game of thrones references!
Yo people they cut off the sounds of the audience
Well ironically she failed to take her own advice.
She is just no one.
I&#39;m 2 minutes but the crowd haven&#39;t made a single noise yet and I&#39;m worried for Maisy because she keeps making jokes
Lmaooo that Lady Gaga quote tho
A girl can speak!
A girl knows how to captivate an audience !! Never knew i needed this Ted talk. Thank you Maisie ♥️
Great job, Maisie.  Little girls need a proper role model.
Thank you! 😊😁
What&#39;s next in her list?
Is she playing the game of faces?
DID YOU KNOW: GoT will be aired on April 14 &amp; Maisie&#39;s birthday is April 15!❤️❤️
Didn&#39;t know I could love Maisie more than I already do❤️
Love from Nepal❤
Uff, Arya still alive at least
Well done, great talk. Daisy sounds fabulous.
The Girll has no face but wise😎
Very helpful, insightful, and inspirational. Thank you :)
Tough crowd
She even looks like a Maisie :D
i love this idea, and i&#39;m so glad she&#39;s using her creativity for something so wonderful!! please bring the app to android soon!! &lt;3
Very proud of you Maisie
What is she going on about?
Arya stark 💘
This girl is great, she should be on a tv show.
A man think the lovely girl is very wise.
Not sure I understand the random direction of this speech. Go back in time and be a talented 11 year old? Or buy stock in GOT? Dream? Make an iPhone ap? Learn a lot but admit you know nothing? Be proud but somehow humble at the same time? lol. Very well spoken, but also very hollow and disappointing from a TED level of expectation.
Congratulations <br>Proud of you<br>Forever @AryaStark
Audience machine broke
I really want to like her, but she’s so incredibly annoying. Sorry!
It is such an amazing talk. Seeking the chance to share your talent(instead of desperately chasing after fame) is a good way to make this world a better place. So proud of you, Maisie.
ARYA STARK is very eloquent!
Amazed that she&#39;s got no title yet she&#39;s good!
To be fair, this is easy for her to say and hard for a desperate, emotionally deprived person, who <b>needs</b> the money, to understand...
She reminds me a little bit of Helena Boham Carter
Go Maisie!!!
I&#39;m really &quot;no one&quot;. I just don&#39;t like the idea of labelling myself. Cheers for such a beautiful lesson, dear Arya stark xoxo
This girl is great🤩
A girl is wonderful
Nicely done Maise!!!! Just wondering if the audience was awake? Really..only ONE person knew you from GOT????
👏👏👏👏👏👏
A girl is wise
Maisie I bet you took it REALLLY seriously when they told you that you are to learn ‘water dance’ 😊
Maise is awesome
The crowd is so dead
ur wasting ur breath williams, none of the idiots who pay for ted events have any sensitivity to the subtleties of devoting ones self to the stage, you should have just written a play about it. :)
A girl has no name.......and is also a fantastic actress and has awesome pink hair. What a brilliant entrepreneur and nerd. I love how the GOt season comes out on her birthday, basically lol.
I love her. ❤️
What a brilliant young woman she has become. Not surprising, not shocking, She literally is Arya of Winterfell as they grew together and learned together. And she is all Maisie, all wrapped up in a total thinker. So proud of her.
Well done Maisie!  I believe in you!  Love your story and your Ted Talks.  Bravo!
You&#39;re an inspiration.
Why did this make me cry! So cool
The audience is wack af!
She really is amazing
How could a family in a three bedroom council house have money for a private school.
This is what I needed to hear now 😊
Brilliant!
Great to see young famous actress to be this down to earth! 90% of Hollywood should look at her as an example.
I&#39;m so proud of her omg 😭
Damn what happened to her?
Brian Cox did a Q&amp;A at a high school in America a few years back. He asked the children at the end what they wanted to be when they grew up. He said over 50% of the school said famous. He was so baffled, he was actually embarrassed that the educational system had failed them on guidence to a proper career with aspirations.
Wow, I was also the icing on an already bad marriage too. Maybe I’ll be okay too. 😊Very wise words.
Here before a million views!
Valar Dohaeris
Not a talk we deserved but a talk we needed. Thank you very much!!
Is that the girl from Game of Thrones?
That was so good
I love how professional she looks
And thats just it, I keep lookin past absolutly ignoring the talent.I wished I didnt even know what a pedestal was.
Turkish subtitles please
POnly she is BRILLIANT!! Luv her...
once GOT is over her career is over
Doesn&#39;t she resemble alaska ( John green )
Wonderful..!!👏👏👏
So glad that No One was invited to do a Tedx talk.
A girls crowd is dead!!
Geeze that crowd is dull...
I don&#39;t know why but this made me cry, she is so inspiring and as soon as daisie comes out on android I&#39;m downloading it and posting my work as a photographer
It has long been proven to no longer be a choice, in the digital age. Strive to be either and or both if it pleases you.
Goooo aryaaaa!!!
Damn cute
Ah, no wonder she was so graceful with Needle, it was all of those dance lessons!  One of my favorite actors from GOT.  She&#39;s got a great career ahead of her!
A wise stark.
Well said,<br>Hope you clear all the name from your list in 8
was there anyone in audience or just dead white walkers?
A wise wolf.<br>Well said lady.
I would say &quot;there can be a hundred people in a room and 99 dont believe in you but all it takes is one, AND THE ONE IS YOU !&quot;
Wow. A Mind blowing talk.
I got my by blew my mind
A lot of Game of Thrones fans in the audience... 🙄😒
To the comments saying:&quot;why is the crowd not laughing&quot; it could be that they are, but there are no mics facing the crowd. If there are, maybe the producers wanted to make it easier to hear her and turned them off.
If I were her age and on stage, it would have said things I would regret in five years. She’s great! The speech speaks to all of us.
Thank you for  sharing your story . I am extremely motivated . Words are not enough to describe this inspiring Ted talk by you.
The audience probably comprised of white walkers.......and wildlings
Very inspiring maisie. Thank you for this.
She is soooo under-appreciated !
Who are you? No one .....GOT
WHY DID TOU TAKE DOWN YOUR GRAHAM HANCOCK SPEECHES?? (Maisie Williams can’t act)
I love Maisie Williams!!!
Valar Dohaeris
Talent takes it ALL ! Everytime.
I knew i liked her for a reason 💗🙌
A girl speaks well
Let&#39;s make this the most viewed Ted talk
A girl is wise
A girl doesn&#39;t strive to be a lady(famous) she strives to be a warrior(talented)!!! <br><br><br><br>Right out of GOT!!!
The man teach you this
awesome loved it  &quot;NO ONE&quot; , just what i needed
God i love you Maisie Williams!!!
Thank  you.This really saved my day.
Her talking is so tiring.
Love u Arya😘😘
Tip : Watch at 1.5X speed
God she’s great
Damn this girl has grown up. Can’t believe it’s been 10 years since game of thrones aired.
Great TED talk! Unfortunately the crowd wasn&#39;t too familiar with her, or laughed at her jokes. I was excited for this ever since it got announced. If anyone wants to hear more from her, I really recommend Rob Moore&#39;s interview. It doesn&#39;t have the attention it deserves. Maisie is a very interesting person that you can learn some things from.
Not even claps. The crowd is dead.
Maisie please change the school system, its broke
The audience is dead
Please survive this season!
She is an amazing person. Absolutely love her work
Damn the crowd is so boring, this is already multiple times I watch a talk thats funny and the crowd is just silent.
YAS MAISE WILLIAMSS
omg shes no nervous i stan
The North remembers!
Love you babe 😍😍😍
That&#39;s arya stark right
Wow !
♥
NED talk? Too soon?
Ty u r amazing and truly inspiring.. That&#39;s it
A girl is awesome. 😊
All you need to read is the FIRST LINE
Is the audience even there? That was awesome haha the audience is embarrassing
She cares more about talking about her career and obeying the title. I don&#39;t mind an introduction and a background, but after being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=265">4:25</a> minutes in I give up, the title tempted me but I was provided with something else.
Love the title..who is she???
&quot;Not Today.&quot;
Inspiring
You are the only person who inspired me to do more. Love you Maisie ❤️❤️
say the lisssssst lol
Anyone els come here for game of thrones spoilers to find out that you gonna watch this whole video instead to listen to her talk lol
Let&#39;s start with the no-name jokes
Don&#39;t live to breathe, live to complete the list..
GoT楽しみにしてるで
Hustle beats talent when talent does not hustle. Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented from the successful one is a lot of hard work. Hi guys! It&#39;s me again :) You might have seen me before but my desire to inspire more people is what keeps me pushing to reach out more. We own a cookie shop business in our college town. When we first started it, we just graduated college and were living in our car with very little direction, just a huge passion to be successful. I started it out of a local bagel shop in their off hours at night with my boyfriend, Bran. It was a crazy experience but it worked! We became a success! And how we have our first storefront location (a second one currently under construction but launching soon!) We started it to fund a year long backpacking trip around the world and to be successful while living the life of our dreams.
The north remembers these words
She&#39;s not funny
There is no one in this video
Brilliant. Some great words of wisdom along with some inspiring words.
Would lick
💛💛💛💛
Words wiser than swords 😉
The crowd is dead, wow!! 😮
You know nothing Arya stark hahaha
Wow, this has really brought her back down to earth for me. That she was and is just a girl who got her break, not this unrelatable mega celebrity I’ve built up in my head. I love this, keep striving Maisie!
Great speech!
You spoke so well I&#39;m inspired thank you so much Massie😘
Why is the audience so stiff, maisie is awesome!!!
Is she the only person in the room!!<br><br><br>I mean ssly the crowd has not responded once.
The faceless god asked herself about being someone else <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=586">9:46</a>
You couldve called it ned talk???
im assuming GRRM didnt write the script.
I woulda made that app for you for free by the way. &lt;3
So cute I just wanna squeeze her!
Ted talks are bad. But this is actually amazing. Can&#39;t wait to try Daisy
She is really fantastic lady and her speech is amazing. God bless you dear.
Maisie WIlliams is what&#39;s known as a prodigy. If you look at her audition tape and scenes in the early days of GOT she&#39;s got better subtlety and timing than a lot of the young actors you see in film and TV roles today. That sort of thing takes years of practice, but she was is prime position to take advantage of a dancing background, intelligence and a naturally emotional personality to carefully craft her movement and expression. The real takeaway from this is taking action. A prodigy can be a prodigy all their life, but opportunity is one thing we fear or ignore because we stare at the door we want opened when there are dozens of other doors that are already open. All they take is one step.
she does not belong here but she tried nicely.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=943">15:43</a> &#39;&#39;Trust that you are good enough&#39;&#39;,  well thats gonna be hanging above my desk from now on :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=690">11:30</a> I wish she had elaborated on this point more. - So many students build up massive debt attending art school and are left with zero clues as to how to transition into careers. Formal academic education in the arts really needs revision, I think.
Awesome speech, Maisie...Luv it...🤘🏻❤☮
👏👏👏👏👏
i love her because she is so real and hard working and passionate about everything. 💖
You are a goddess, merci mille fois from France  you are inspiring, smart and beautiful 😍😚💓
A girl is not nothing...... A girl gave a ted talk
Didn‘t go to school, followed her dreams, is more sucessfull than most of us will ever be. <br><br><br>School doesn‘t help build your dreams
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=751">12:31</a><br>😂😂😂😂😂<br>Doing that Lady Gaga impression or just trying to have an American accent, thats adorable<br>😄😁😁😊😊😊
What App she talk about?
&quot;There is truly a place for everyone.&quot; What she means ?
This is on point. 👍
Stark winter is coming
Truly inspiring😁👍👏
💕 inspiring!!!!!!👌
😭
Proud of you Arya😍
oh Arya we love you so much 😙. You are a great actor. Eagerly waiting for GOT final season.
VERY LUCKY Girl. not everyone can be so lucky .. but luckily the entertainment industry will grow in the future .. we all love a good Game of Thrones
Those Chuck Taylors 😍
Tough croud,huh!
She stepped out of the red circle. You little rebel!!
Great Tedx Talk
Thank you... Right now I&#39;m at no space ,, just still struggling with my decision I&#39;m at the age of 24 and just last year I lost my job , so I decided for further studies, I did that I appeared my exam and now I don&#39;t know what to do anymore! Though, yes I have various aims in life from my childhood one thing that didn&#39;t change was me wanting to become a writer though I didn&#39;t actually know anything about it. And I&#39;m still learning .. I sometimes write whatever comes in my head but I feel it&#39;s not enough cause that&#39;s what most people can do it . I feel like i have it planned out like I will just open a quote account on Instagram and make it public and start a advising blogs/vlogs for passive income so that it could further help me to move forward but even it&#39;s all planned out responsibility asked to be taken in hand by family has put me in no space I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore .
crowd is the entire Nanny McPhee 2 staff
Just finished season 7
Let&#39;s hope she didnt have a toast with the audience after the end of her speech..
A girl is Arya stark of winterfell and she is in home.
Arya stark.......<br>Well said
Title is miss leading. No content at all! Looks like she came here to sell her iOS app. <br>Request TED team to kindly review the content before offering this platform to such guys.<br><br>PS: I&#39;m fan of Arya Stark but not on TED.
Listened. All the way untill the end
Love you 😘😘
learning English with arya stark OMG &lt;3
Her journey was so beautiful her <br> Word States Do hard work enjoy lot from it and also enjoy the work
she shake my head !!
i thought we were born with talent
now this one deserves to sit on the iron throne!
AHHHHH lol!
awwwn
Serio Forrel was her first dancing master .... Lol
I had a really busy day, and  I felt like I made everything wrong. I was really upset because I wasn&#39;t great enough on my first challenge today. However, by the end of her talking, I understood the message and I know that she talked to me. Thank you Maisie &lt;3
She&#39;s cute 😳😘
I remember I was in London going to work on the bus. And Maisie Williams got on the bus. I kept looking at her and she kept looking back. I guess she gets that a lot. I smiled at her but she looked very pissed.<br>I went up to her and asked for a picture, turns out it wasn&#39;t her, just someone that looks like her :/
(Angry talk about children who try to instruct us on how to live our lives)
Basically, what ranchhod das chhachadd preached. 🤭
Wish I had a dream in life. Sounds nice
Omg..... it&#39;s that girl out of the seafret video,  oceans..... man...  you should of wore the hat...
I love this ted talk. It&#39;s very motivating. And I would love to try out this app she mentioned.. but it&#39;s not available for android at the moment T_T
Exceeded expectations by a mile.
She&#39;s so cute!
Yass queen!!!
Edward Stark would be proud.
Wait....Is this the girl from GOT?
2% of the people in the world are always miserable no matter what. That&#39;s why the thumbs down are always right around 2% of the thumbs up. The down votes come from the miserable people.
So well said my friend. We should all keep dreaming and never give up on what we believe in
I adore this girl &lt;3 i JUST LOVE HER
She sounds like a very posh northener. I mean north of england not westeros.
That indeed was inspiring especially the last bit. Thank you, Maisie.
Dont strive to be famous... yet I only clicked on this because shes a famous face.
HBO pushing GoT to the intellectuals, 👏 👏 👏
Th title speaks for itself 👏👏👏
Hodor!
Im so happy im crying. This is what i needed!
great talk maisie, ily
I loved this. Usually I tune out around minute 12, but she had me honestly hooked all the way through. Very cool
Kill people. Pay tax.
Everybody&#39;s little sister
We love you Maisie!!
great talk arya
Real inspiration🙌
Don&#39;t strive to be famous, strive to be no one.
I&#39;m sorry but all I can see is Rogerina😭😭😭
A girl has taught me something today
There&#39;s No One
Ted would&#39;ve been proud :)) only if joffrey didn&#39;t cut his head off.....
Is there an audiance? Why are they not reacting?
Lovely Ted Talk!
&quot;A man attains greatness by his merits, not simply by occupying an exalted seat. Can we call a crow an eagle simply because he sits on the top of a tall building?&quot; - Chanakya Pandita
Eyebrows.
Ohuuuuuuuuu 😍 Miss Williams
Go Maisie! So reflective and daring:) Great storyteller ...! And so great that the people in the audience show the respect of being quiet and listen. Trust you are good enough!
Telling people to jogg on... im stealing that one
Arya Stark.. You are awesome
Keşke Türkçe altyazi olsa
Subtítulos en español por favor!!
Wow, I remember when she came to my university do to talk and giving a speech with the same passion and wisdom. It&#39;s almost scary how I&#39;ve seen this both in real life on a uni hall, and now behind a screen on a TedTalk video.
Very good Talk young lady. Continue to do well in life👍🏾👏🏾
Che esta arruonada arya
Just amazing!!!
lol I dont like her anymore xD
Meh. Not everyone <i>needs</i> to do a ted talk
A girl is talented
The brave wolf
Proud of you, Maisie!  Thx for sharing!
Yatılı okula mı gitseydim ya 😃
Me gustaría verlo con subtítulos en español!!!
Tout le monde ne parle pas anglais merci de mettre des sous titres, en espagnol en français italien allemand etc etc c’est la moindre des choses. Pffff
I could listen to her all day, she is so articulate.
Woah. Shes really good at public speaking :o that&#39;s my Arya! 😂
Okay . I&#39;ll do it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=878">14:38</a> Best line of the Session <br>Hats off to you mam <br>You told us to achieve excellence in us and rest all money, fame etc will follow us

Gracias amiga tu show me alludo muchísimo cuídate Dios bendiga tu corazón
She was great very well delivered.
Ayaa staak
Well done, Maisie!

Got the privilege to watch this live, nice talk
What was the app she was talking about?
This was so Inspiring and well needed 👏👏👏👏👏 i love you Maisie
Ooh gonna check out the app! How awesome! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I think you&#39;re amazing Maisie!!
The woman who saw all the existence.
Amazing!!
I&#39;m amazed at how many people got sucked into this! I mean c&#39;mon, success stories like this are a dime a dozen! This was nothing but a GoT and self promo! Sheesh!
Fantastic
The girl speaks well ..
Aryaaaa
PARABÉNS....BOA SORTE...🍀🌞ainda  vamos a tempo de comemorar o 🌟dia 🌻INTERNACIONAL🍀 DA MULHER 🌷 8 🌟DE🌟 MARÇO  DE ☀️☀️💚💛🇵🇹 2019🌟☀️🇵🇹🌻🇵🇹
Love you Meyzi
She is awesome!!!&lt;3
Wait is this actually the game of thrones girl?
WHAT?! Arya did a told talk!?
I wish she could take her own advice
Never watched GoT but I just googled this lovely person and I just found out she&#39;s exactly my age, to the day.   She has accomplished so much, surely I can do the same.
I wish I knew about this. I would have tried to attend
Power to the creators !! Excellent!
I hate to be that person (she&#39;s very well spoken &amp; this was an enlightening talk), BUT: Talent (like good-luck, which she briefly touches upon) is just about the last thing one can &#39;strive&#39; for. How talented or naturally &#39;apt&#39; you are to succeed at certain things is entirely random. Sure, one can work hard enough to excel at something, but in the end they will always be lagging behind those with actual talent (who, mind you, also works at perfecting their craft), and this is especially true for the arts. So, while, this has been a very enjoyable speech - sadly it&#39;s filled with empty ideals, and the over-simplified &#39;follow your dreams&#39; slogan - usually coming from the mouths of celebs who once got lucky. Having said that, I do think she is one of the (if not the) most talented actors on the show &amp; I wish her all the best for the future.
This should be titled &quot;Valar Morghulis, Valor Dohaeris&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYOpfGvlwc&amp;t=150">2:30</a> well how else could you have become no one?
I love you so so so so so much,  Arya Stark ❤❤
Do not strive for money. Strive for service and experiences. You will never have to worry about money.
We all know her
Dream Big and believe in that, you will be successful 1 day
Wow I first loved you as Arya, and loving you more now for who you truly are. I am blessed by your story Maisie. Glory to God! God bless you and your family more.
I work in Manchester and I missed going to this? God damn!
I loved the way she says &quot;Opportunity or Challenge&quot;. These 3 words explains a lot...
I <br>FEEL<br>SO<br>MUCH<br>CRINGE<br><br><br>send help
another British accent
WHY THAT JACKET THOUGH????!!
She&#39;s the coolest. A girl is no one.
Just the title is enough for me :)<br>Somebody gets it!!
Learnt a thing or two.. good talk!
“This girl lying to me”<br>😁
I&#39;m literally screaming right now. I just got this notification I was so shocked, Like Maise Williams doing a Ted talk??? I&#39;m soooo happy for her, she&#39;s such an inspiration! 👏❤
Good job
A TRUE QUEEN❤
Why is no one in the stage
A girl has no name &lt;3
Holy poop, who thought to see you here? But either way, you completely deserve it!!
yeah think I saw you in the series &quot;doctor who&quot;
Valar Morghulia
Am I the only one who doesn&#39;t know anything about GoT😂.. Well she&#39;s a really talented young lady💜💙💜💙💜
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Proud to have ya at Ted talk, Maisie.
For those of you who don&#39;t know,<br>she plays Arya Stark in Game of Thrones one of the best TV shows on the Earth!
Amazing content! Any small youtubers wanna support each other? Thanks!
She is sooo fit😍😍😍
Cammie!!!
i love her so much. how nice she is
Maisie this is ted not buzzfeed
Quite an enjoyable ad.
How old is she
What is the point of this talk? What is the point of Ted talks anymore? No big new concepts, no brilliant revelations and no purpose. Is this the degradation of western civilization? A girl bragging about herself  for 15 minutes wow. I hear girls brag about themselves every day this is foolishness and pointless.
I didn&#39;t know I needed this tedtalk ❤️ people disliking must be the failed auditions of the success she has achieved
I saw this live and it taught me that all you need is an idea.<br>And a big pot of money from your Emmy-nominated acting career.<br>And a friend with a big pot of money from years of successful business ventures.<br><br>With just those three things, you too can set up a company, get offices in Shoreditch, employ some staff and release an app.
A man wants to hear more.

<b>Fame doesn’t last, it comes crashing down or it fades away. Usually taking you with it...</b>

love her 💜💛💚
it was her own story rather than clearing the title meaning ,but i like it
Dare to dream big...
GAME OF THRONES FANS LIKE
The crowd is dead
Fame and talent are completely unrelated nowadays, I’ll just strive to be wealthy because that’s really all I want.
She&#39;s pretty interms of both looking and speaking
That blonde hair with those eyebrows....wow
Love you Massie
Beautifull girl and voice
TL;DR: Read last two sentences.<br>Daisy sounds like an incredible opprotunity, but my skepticism has me to believe it&#39;ll just be another instagram, where being famous on instagram is... good, but in it&#39;s own way. I was informed by an ex coworker who lived in the famous parts of California that most of the instagram famous people you see (who are only instagram famous and have nothing else to their name), are just about homeless. They crash on their friend&#39;s couches or can only afford an air mattress in their empty apartment with &quot;expensive clothes&quot; that aren&#39;t even theirs. This app proposes the ideal promise of basically being noticed for your talent(s), but the problem, much like instagram, is the comparing agencies, companies, etc will make. Now, of course, comparing is unavoidable, no matter what industry you work in, there will be competition, I just wish Daisy could also propose learning for improvement in ones talent or desired talent. Talent does not always come natural like it happen to be for Maisie, sometimes it&#39;s worked at. I would know because when i was 12 I started taking up drawing and i knew it sucked, like actually really sucked, but I worked at it. I looked for guidance in friends, art classes, free online lessons and eventually became good. <br>I&#39;m just stating that if Maisie wants to diminish the social-economic issues of becoming famous proposed by having to pay for an expensive education, give people the option to develope their skills because not every person will have raw talent, but they will have passion. Unfortunately passion isn&#39;t acknowledged by agencies because it is a risky investment, they want good product right off the back.
Bhagwat please react
Whyyy
Love you Maisie. That was a great talk
I mean it is an interesting story, but is it really worth a ted talk? I like the show and her acting, but neither is her talk really teaching me anything nor opening my eyes for something. It is just her biography.
Oysters,Clams and Cockells!
You are &quot;NO ONE &quot;❤🤩😍
Says the person who got everything since she was a kid
A girls has No name
Oh so this was a commercial
A girl is all grown up
The beginning was cringe
Comment section is filled with arya
Anyone can do TedX now? This is silly - I’d rather hear from someone with life experience than a famous kid
I didn&#39;t know who you were before this, but thank you for a great speech Maisie &lt;3
Auto click.
A girl is one fine Ted girl now.
not gonna lie, I had to google her name cause I had no idea who she was
Loved that she quoted Gaga😂👏👏
Love her face I m in love
Sorry, gonna hate on her hair a bit.
She&#39;s a great actress
Doctor who?
مب ذي حقت قيم اوف ثرونز؟
Another empty Ted Talk that is a promo rather than a lesson. <br>It&#39;s disappointing how Ted continues to sell out.
Great 👍🏾
aal iz well
Talent is God given, be humble!<br>Fame is man-given, be grateful!<br>Conceit is self given, be careful!
Yeees!
Amazing 😍 keep going...
Wooww she is terrific
She is an awesome person!
Arya Stark💜
