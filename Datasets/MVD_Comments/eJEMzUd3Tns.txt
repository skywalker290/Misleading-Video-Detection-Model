I always test my damage by seeing which types of slimes I can one-shot.
I think it&#39;s crazy that Felix actually managed to beat EoW first try 😂 j died instantly on my first play through
I like how his house improves every episode, but the hellevator in the house- and going into the dungeon...
It took me 10 small seeds to get an enchanted sword
In  jorney mode you Can have infinite items if you have the right amount
so many events happning in one epiosode and alot of cool items to as well as alot of bosses

i like how everyone keeps telling him in the chat not to go down then he gets killed by skeletron and was like WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME
&quot;Eat my balls and marinate them&quot; -pewdiepie
Why does Mr beast have 83.6M sub and pewdiepie have 110M sub I thought Mr beast is the famous
Lmao I thought he was gonna summon the eater of worlds
Fun fact you can ether have a corruption world or a crimson world <br><br>Pa PewDiePie has a corruption world
Pewdiedie there more sword is CALLS bee sword

When he went down I was waiting for his reaction to the dungeon guardian
WHEN HE SAW METEOR he be like me touch meteor me die

Pewdiepie is a sith confirmed<br>Also, by using a space gun he has confirmed himself to be uncivilized
Epic clutch when he was falling and then he grappled to the block
pewds&#39;s reaction to 2nd phase to the eye of chutulu is priceless
You get to see his reaction to eye of cuthulu 2nd phase, Hell, and dungeon guardian in one video!
Hi past water bolt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=8">0:08</a> <br>I Agree.

Nonstop YA 77 was here
How do I make a house in this game
Genital house
Jesus be like BRUUUUH
Why hasn&#39;t he done a hardmode playthrough
Pewds makes my brain hurt in this game
Mower
I love how he unconsciously realised &quot;I&#39;ve been playing all day&quot; and said it out loud out of nowhere, and proceeded to play without a blink of an eye.
There a lot happening in this video, he finally killed the EOC, he accidentally summon a King Slime, he entered the dungeon without any preparation, breaking the Shadow Orbs not knowing he will summon the boss, meteorite and battling the goblin armies 🙂
Normal mode moment
Ikkea loks like a dikk
Everybody gangsta until he gets into hell and says “I’ve returned”
Pewdepie : &quot;I&#39;m A coward&quot; <br><b>music intensifies</b>
there are no lightsabers in minecraft  becose that make the game so dumb
not good like minecraft minecraftr is top 1
I liked the forest gump reference
Where the i should have listen part🙌👐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1297">21:37</a> I made the same mistake but instead of 1 it was 5
Wish he played expert lol
Anyone else here suddenly got this video as suggestions?
Me: The EoC doesn&#39;t dash?<br><br>Also me: <b>Realized I play terraria in expert for first time</b>
kills eye of cthulu* dies to king slime*
me after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=367">6:07</a> of the video: never mind you can beat the eye of cthulhu
no cap i have actually beaten the game 11 times
Me who has already beaten the game 11 times:<br>Someone as bad as you can&#39;t beat the eye of cthulhu with that loot
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1335">22:15</a> &lt;- the exact moment when Pewds falls onto two measly tiles of cobweb after a 50 tile high panic dive, purely by chance and oblivious of the fact, a split second before he falls onto the ground. Which resets the fall counter iirc.<br>Sweet Baby Cthulhu...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1310">21:50</a> wait till he sees the unicorns
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=393">6:33</a> <br>Pewds: &quot;I have a zombie arm. Where did i get that from?&quot;<br>Me: <b>Surprised pikachu</b>
Use water bucket
Has he ever posted the seed for this?
This video will not leave my auto playlist. I’ve removed it so many times wtf
Imagine being able to beat the EoC but not the King Slime, F.
Jungle and dungeon are at different ways
HIS LUCK IS UNBALANCED
Pp lol
He didn’t even grab the water boltttt
Give me you seed pewds please I need it
pewdiepie craft the zenith sword
Do not enter corrupted Hole Or worm kill you
even when i eas playing terraria for first time i went in there there were two who killed me and went back  they were horrible
Pewds: i helped an eye before now ill take one down
I have 2000 hours in terraria (dont have a life) and its so nice to see Felix experience everything for the first time.
&quot;Bats are so small and annoying&quot;<br><br>Lava bats : well yes but actually no
His Ikea house looks good
pewds: &quot;come back!&quot;<br>2 seconds later: &quot;Get off my property&quot;
The all boss in terraria is guardian in the dungeon and moon lord and impress of light and king slime and wall of flesh and qeen slime and eater of the world and skeletron and duke the fishrune and mech big boss and martians and goblin and pirates and and golem and plantera and lot of more
Spoken like a true American <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1018">16:58</a>
Don&#39;t forget that there is sus in jesus
PewDiePie dies: WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME<br>Five seconds earlier: they say don&#39;t go down well I&#39;m going anyway
Pewds: this guy came now<br><br>Norsum: it&#39;s a good day to die!<br><br>Pewds: i agree
EoW on first try without prep and a beginner... I’m impressed.
Haha
He has done the initiation of Going to the Dungeon Pre-Skeletron
This was equivalent to sleeping in the nether, except for people warned him not to do it

This is the best terraria let’s play I’ve ever seen
I miss this game sosososo much  I&#39;ve been playing 4 2016 I don&#39;t know now how 2 play

Terraria: why did we do this<br>Pewdiepie: I hate this game <br>Terraria: f*ck you
Pewdiepie: WHAT THE F*CK IS THAT
Piw
&quot;What is this game at this point?&quot;<br>It&#39;s a sandbox game XD <br>It has absolutely tons of jokes and references, it contains tons of nerd culture
&quot;Why doesn&#39;t Minecraft have lightsabers?&quot; he asks<br>Because Minecraft was built based on the idea of simplicity... and Terraria was definitely not, it has very complex crafting trees, many tiers and varieties of a f*** ton of things
I have over 200 hours in terraria, post moon lord gear, and I have never found an enchanted sword. And pewds finds it before the EoC
he got very lucky finding that sword lol
When i played Terraria with my friend for the first time, we made a nightmare pickaxe and he said “wow, i can’t believe i have the second best pickaxe in the game!”<br>Those were simpler times
Terrraria has been my fav game of all time since it came out but no that pewds played it everyone i know keeps saying that i found the game out from him. They always say be careful hat you wish dont they
Fun Fact Of Water Of Worlds Boss:They Get Weaker When They Get Smaller

I literally cryed watching this did anyone else notice the water bolt?
Whats is SEEEEED?! DATS EPIC

Pewdiepie:kills the boss in 3 minutes  <br>Me:dies before I even get to look at the boss
this is painful
&quot;screams echo around you&quot;<br><br>Felix: epic
Felix: I’m getting a lot of nos...<br>Felix: (dies to dungeon guardian)<br>Felix: Why didn’t anyone tell me?
IK this vid is like a year old, but when felix put the master sword theme over him finding the enchanted sword I just got excited for some reason....

U need the enchanted sword to craft the zenith in 1.4
It took me two years to get the beam sword and when I finally got it, it was useless to me.
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaàaaaa
Pewds lose to king slime that weaker than Eater of world wow so embarassing
How many health do you have on terraria <br><br><br>(I have 425 health)
how did he find the enchanted sword in his third episode and i’m on hardcore mode almost done with the game and haven’t found it 😐
Rare things that Felix didn’t know he had:<br>Sword Shrine<br>Eye of Cululon shield<br>Chanted sword<br>Pearlstone<br>Hell <br>I said hell  because he can find demons that drop voodoo dolls that if he drops in lava he can kill guild or Conner and then summon the wall of flesh which sends him and his Notorious world into hard mode so good luck Felix.<br>Do more of terraria vids but with Mark and jack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=105">1:45</a> you could say your iced out...<br><br><br><br><br>Ima go now

imagine if pewds had the crimson biome
&quot;cute penquins&quot; &quot;kills it&quot;  &quot;dead cute penquins&quot;
Did anyone notice that his web cam shut off? Like if you did
Every one: DONT GO DOWN felix: why also felix: WHY DIDN&#39;T YOU TELL ME?!?
I had to make over 20 worlds to find the enchanted sword
I literally had better stuff than he did when he killed the Eye of Cthulhu and I died 3 times
I don’t think pewds understands how hard it is to find the enchanted sword
You need to put sunflowers in the jungle
Your suppose to kill the master skull than you can go in the palce
lmao he ignored a sword shrine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=61">1:01</a>
Felix:its getting hot in here<br>Me:so take of all your clothes
Finally!
Like how he just randomly found a shrine
Soy un hombre
Hi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=838">13:58</a> yrimirs just gonna suddenly reappear to tell pewds to look for a water bolt
Felix:dont freak out felix<br>Also felix: RUNN AWWAAYYY
Me: <b>plays terraria 10 times, always quits after beating eye of cthulhu</b><br><br>Pewdiepie: <b>accidentally beats all the bosses</b>
For the love of god that cursing censorship noise that he uses is SOOOOOO annoying
Mark and jack have there own boss lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=231">3:51</a> I remember when I got that sword. It was so cool. But then my world got deleted. Idk why but I’m guessing from an update.
… I&#39;m Elite baby, don&#39;t you see the outfit? <br>Double pumps don&#39;t matter, man I got this <br>Shoot a rocket, and pop a mini at the same time <br>If you put a scar in my hand, then it&#39;s game time…
Pewdiepie:*dies by dungeon guardian<br><br>Dungeon guardian:about to end this mans whole career
How lucky are some people, i have a end game world and i never found the enchanted sword q.q
its annoying me seeing bees in the jungle cos that means pewds mined the hive without realising
Punch out
Omg I thought I was so good at first at this game and a month latar in my large world I relize I&#39;m still not even close to beating the game
Hey pewds you gonna be a melee ranged sommoner or mage
Zombies in blood moon can Now open doors and annoying :/
He went down the dungeon..<br><br><br>My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
pewdiepie in blood moon:problem solved<br><br>what i hear:problem solved iam alpha kid
hahaha a skull head surpised pewdiepie
Pewdiepie: accidentally founds the enchanted sword.<br>Me still trying to find it to have zenith: Life is really fun until it&#39;s unfair
2020 ANYONE????
How the fuck did he stumble upon a shrine???
I just did the same mistake
Day 367 of waiting for Felix to do a Mary Poppins with the umbrella
IS NOT FOR KIDS
Why do you say badwords
Pewdipie I thought you kill memes and didnt say badwords....
I listening pewd and hear some japanese thing like bakayaro
Is anyone not mad that he toke off the space helmet that makes his space gun cost 0 mana
I guess so
Who is still watching this after 4 years PewDiePie is changed in feature
why not get zenith
How did pewds beat the eye with 160 health and I have 300 and I did not beat him
This was  very entertaining.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=879">14:39</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=878">14:38</a>
There are so many bosses here😂😂😂
Did he miss a WATER BOLT!?
Wow He has a good seed enchanted sword is likely hard for me because I Always Kill The Wall Of Flesh First 😅<br>lol i rewatched this after a year and now i see how much my english was barely good anyway if none understood it here <br>&quot;Cool He Has A Good Seed, Finding Enchanted Sword is Too Hard for Me (I didn&#39;t know there was Fishing in Terraria (Fishing = Crates = Enchanted Sword)) and so I ignored it and continued with my progress and went straight ahead to kill the Wall of Flesh even tho you would probably get the enchanted sword on early and then when i found out about Zenith I was already at Empress of Light(Day) and just shocked that i would still need to really find an enchanted sword bruh well First of All I waited for many hours just to get an enchanted sword seed bruh
If the real hell was terreria I would force myself to be immortal
there is a fricking gamer cactus cross in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=82">1:22</a>
My Eye of Cthulhu in Master mode is easy, I did not even lose a heart.

Me with bone key. Laughs in Deep Caribbean Accent.

Lel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=88">1:28</a>
Creeper
I&#39;m disappointed in you Felix. Found a good sword but no beach ball :(
How to set bed as a spawnpoint
Felix npcs have their own preferences where if you put them in specific places they sell items cheap, if they are all together than they will start getting extremely expensive.
Pewdiepie: I think were ready for the eye<br><br><b>JACKSEPTICEYE INTENSIFIES</b>
For his experience with terraria, he is smoort
You download all items map for terraria.
Hey pewds, if you want a better picaxe i recommened the Reaver Shark. You obtain it by fishing in the ocean biome and you need the reinforce fishing pole and enchanted nightcrawlers.
Everybody gansta &#39;til the eye goes underground.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=365">6:05</a>
Bruh he got meteorite on 3rd episode.  I didn&#39;t get meteorite until I got to mid-hardmode.. .-.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1277">21:17</a> the dark side of the force is strong with this one.
Slimes raining from the sky <br><br><br>Me knowing what&#39;s gonna happen
es muy tierno como el piensa que esto es todo lo que se puede hacer
Pewdiepiiiiiieeeee soo you gonna KIL SVEN HUH THE RABBITS AR SVEN
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=580">9:40</a> It&#39;s A Sandstorm Or Something Else
I love how he just says: “O Lord” in hell
That meteor.
I never know PewDiePie plays terraria
I want to see how he does in master mode
The space gun is good
Me takes forever to find magic mirrior<br>Felix:finds enchanted sword in 3 episodes
&quot;Screams are echoing around you&quot;<br><br>Felix: <b>EPIC</b>
Pewds you have a lot more to being a pro than you think, Have you defeated the mechs yet?
“What is hurting me all the time!?”<br><br><br>You’re in terraria now. 😂<br>If you don’t want hurt, you should’ve clocked out at the title screen.
Now just play Master Mode...
Thomas the train lmao.
Anyone else notice he passed the sleeping fisherman?
What’s wrong with Felix is he thinks that terraria is like Minecraft. So he goes into bosses unprepared then he’ll probably die one day
Just the way PewDiePie commentates  and talks makes his content so much better
you need atleast 200 health for any boss its luck that you defeated the eye of cthulu
Pewdiepie: realizes he can get better helmet “I already have a helmet though”<br>Terraria veterans: 😐
Like me please
I can&#39;t believe pewdiepie found a shrine
There was a water bolt right there! In the entrance!
That feeling when you stumble upon the enchanted sword and be like &quot;W0t?&quot;
I really want to join and teach pewdipie.😀😀😀😀
Nice meme&#39;s and sounds though 😀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
PewDiePie theres a water bolt and dont go any further when it says underground you must run 🏃🏃🏃😲
I&#39;m surprised he could go that far down there. xD
😂😂😂😂
STRESS LEVEL- I HAVE DASHED TO COMMENTS WHEN HE STARTED GOING DOWN TO DUNGEON
Omg you got the zelda sword its very rare
I was just waiting for the super dash at the end of the boss fight, but pews wasn&#39;t at expert mode sadly
Get some 👓
i bought minecraft and know i want to buy terraria but my parents wont let me xD xD
You&#39;re literally not prepared for boss battlea huh?
This game is best with friends
Bro there’s penguins <b>*casually chops it in half*</b>  ......that’s so cool
Pain
Pewds: I don&#39;t need light to see in the dark<br>Me: I can&#39;t see what you are doing place torches please
Him going down in the dungeon was the best part of the livestream Bc 80% of people were spamming “NONONO STOOOOOP STOP” and 20% didn’t know why the hell people were freaking out
block meteorite , got in random World? Sorry bad english?
the dungeon guardian be like. UUUKAHAA
Sometimes I think &quot;Wow, he&#39;s actually heaps good at this&quot; And then I remember he&#39;s not being forced to play in expert mode T-T
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=166">2:46</a> Don? That you?
When you get good enough defeat the moon lord for a spell, it will allow you to fly and act like a mining helmet.
There were no creepers in Terraria. Therefore, Pewds has become the creeper.
me: Goes down the dungeon<br>Pewds: goes down the dungeon<br>Both: die from &quot;skeleton guard&quot;<br>Also Both: get jumpscared.
You should go mining more
Things that you can’t mine you should explode with dynamite
I didnt think it was pokimans! I thought it was penis
🖕🖕🖕
Imagine felix vs skeletron
Wow! PewDiePie is learning his first Pie pro sword C:
this video pewdiepie is so lucky he found a enchanted sword woooow
I was waiting for arkhalis
Been playing for a month still haven’t found enchanted sword
Pewds: WhY dId YoU nOt TeLl mE ??<br>Chat: NoOoOoOo DoN&#39;t gO
I&#39;s anyone scrolling down through the comments to find the person that mentioned that his camera went out for the rest of the video?
Hi pews, I&#39;m building a social media site and think you could help. Its what you have talked about. Let me know. Thanks
Pewds before he meets the terrablade
Anyone else hate it when he plays of camera?
My parents are going to divorce but watching you makes me feel better so thank you if you see this witch you wont
I don&#39;t understand what happened<br>Why is the title so dramatic if nothing happened-
How has this man got an enchanted sword 🤣🤣
haha imagine getting corruption in your world<br><br><br>--this post was made by the crimson gang
Someone should tell him that the corruption or crimson spread in hardmode
bruh i looked for an enchanted sword for hours and he found it by accident his map is so fkin lucky
When Pewdiepie plays minecraft frick frick frick when pewdiepie plays terraria $#!*    ****#!#!*#*!$
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=876">14:36</a><br>Bye!!!<br>Bye bye!!
They said don&#39;t freaking go pewds
Felix <b>Accidentally finds The Master Sword</b><br>Also Felix: W o T ! ?
Pewds: (kills eye of Cthulhu without platforms with a chain knife<br>Also pewds: (dies to king slime)
he&#39;s so happy for getting an enchanted sword (which is usually bad luck terraria veterans in the comments)<br>imagine how happy he would be if that was an arkalis
I&#39;m not one to watch streamers but if you&#39;re a long time watcher of pewds you&#39;ll love watching his stream which is in his description.
pewdiepie:*beats eater world with a meterorite armor and space gun*<br>me with full set molten armor and a flame sword (I get it using reaver shark):excuse me.WHAT THE FUCK!
Next episode on, Pewds the idiot: he’s finally 1% done with the game! Buuuttt... he tries to defeat the wall it flesh! Like an idiot! <br><br><br><br><br>Hello person scrolling through the comments
People when pewds played minecraft: what the F is the seed?<br><br>Meanwhile pewds in terraria: im not even gonna complain about it
When you get a blood moon, slime rain and meteorite and kill the eye of chufulu and the eater of world&#39;s in the same video
I didn’t realise how much I wanted a boss fight with the Eater of Worlds with the Thomas the Tank Engine theme until I heard it for a split second
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=875">14:35</a><br><br><b>It was at this moment that he knew..</b><br><br><b>He fucked up</b>
Wow, forgot how easy Eye of Cthulhu is on classic.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=489">8:09</a> says jesus lord in hell
Life becomes a lot easier once you have Paladin’s Hammer.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1451">24:11</a> is this one of the <b>&quot;why do I hear boss music?&quot;</b> situations?
The space guns noise is SO annoying!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=865">14:25</a><br>a smile just slowly came on my face
dREAM its time for another seed search
how does he respawn with all his equipment???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=883">14:43</a> the dungeon guardian
Most likely pewdiepie&#39;s mind: man I should just go back to minecraft. Im way better at that.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=863">14:23</a>
Pewdiepie: zombie arm<br>Also Pewdiepie: where did I get that from?
That thing can become a pet it is almost impossible to get though
Pewdiepie: goes to hell and finds dungeon instantly <br><br>Me: HOW THE <b>**</b> THAT TOOK ME 3 DAYS TO FIND AND I KNOW WHAT IM DOING
Oof
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1487">24:47</a> I think that was based off of Centipede
Did he not notice the ancient sword shrine entrance?
Why are there so many zombies doesn’t know that we goblins
Damn, you got so much good stuff so fast. HOW DO YOU ALWAYS GET GOOD WORLDS WTF!
I wanna see Felix reaction to expert eye of cathulu
Pewds: holds with his spider web to not have fall dmg<br>Me: laughs in my umbrella
Is anyone else that stage where they one tap the eye
I love how PEWDIEPIE has played like 10 years less terreria than me but he is so much better than me
pewdiepie is lowkey dwight shrute
Ah yes the jungle bat frustration that every terrarian has gone through
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=62">1:02</a> enchanted sword
AWUAWUA YO NO HABLO INGLES Y NO ENTIENDO NADA
I love how he doesn’t release you you do stuff straight from the inventory
Pewdienoob <br>Ok no

Not to brag I’ve bettin the flesh dude 6 times my character is full chlorophyte
Me desperately waiting for days to get a slime rain Felix finds 3rd day
I have killed the dungeon guardian because it got gliched(:
It almost makes me mad, because of the fact that he doesn’t realize how lucky he is 😂😂😂
Goes into dungeon<br><br>Me: dude I can’t wait to see his reaction when the dungeon guardian smites him
I hope covid 19 is gone
Pewdiepie: <b>goes to Dungeon</b><br><br>       <b>to be continued</b>
Ngl but u r actually alright at this
Ive literally never got that... ;-;
He didnt just get the enchanted sword...
There was a water bolt in front of the dungeon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=275">4:35</a> thats what she said
I&#39;ve never found the enchanted sword and I&#39;ve been playing for 4 years 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=218">3:38</a> <br>Why is he so lucky??
Dessert lands then right next to snow lands??? My brain get big hurt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=230">3:50</a> we shouldn&#39;t tell him about terra blade<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=323">5:23</a> and about Brothers... At least eye of chtulhu in master
the dungeon master is summoned at night
The principle is : the longer you stay outdoors, the more hordes of monster will try to kill you
Whats your seed pls
Whats your seed pls
when terraria has a dead end.....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>me: terraria has a very small world ?!
I want to tell this to some gamers but they think its soo boring and my classmates told me to stop playing terraria
How can he kill 2 bosses and attemp to kill another bosse in one episode
The demon throwing purple scythes if u kill him u get the scythe
Do the eater of worlds
Pewd : <b>runs past angler</b><br>Me : <b>screams in agony</b>
&quot;When you think this game cant get any weirder it does&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Just wait till he gets the fishing tools lol
It’s really annoying me how he didn’t get that water bolt at the top of the dungeon
So... we&#39;re just gonna ignore the fact that he easily destroyed the EoW as a first - time Terrarian with no arena.
there&#39;s an ocean at the end of your terraria world
The terraria and minecraft lords blessed him so much that he always found rare items
I saw a walking goldfish in terraria and I haven’t finished this series so I hope he finds one and keeps it
Me: u failed king slime<br><br>Felix: so what<br><br>Me: bruh
I wish I was as lucky as pewds.
Everyone telling felix not to go down there...<br><br><br>Felix: <b>dies</b><br><br><br><br>Also felix: WhY DiD YOu NoT TELL Mee!!!

Hello comments I&#39;m from the future the journey end&#39;s is released
Why everyone is writing about the enchanted sword?
You should defeat the giant skeleton
did he just ignore the waterbolt?
is this a jojo refrence
Felix use the snow wood it can make cool furniture
Didn&#39;t anyone find it irritating that Pewds is using his mining helmet for combat?
Did pewds just walk past the water bolt at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=832">13:52</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=875">14:35</a> that made me stop playing Terraria
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1024">17:04</a> idk why but the sound effects killed me lmafooo
I am watching this when 1.4 came out on p.c so I am triggered how he got an I still don’t have it for zenith
WHAT THE HELL WHY ARE YOu SO LUCKY
Btw the &quot;Spooky Biome You said is called corruption its evil and it invades your world it cannot corrupt the hallow but it can corrupt other bioms.
Pew die pie i want to tell you that NPC&#39;s Have their own housing it requiires a chair,walls,a table,and a light source
chest = wimpy safe :)
After reading all the comments i guess the Enchanted Sword is pretty rare. idk i have like 4 hours into Terraria and i found it on my 3rd world
WAIT TILL PEWDS ACCIDENTALLY BREAKS A BULB WHILE HE’S IN THE UNDERGROUND JUNGLE
He missed a water bolt at the entrance to his dungeon, this video is making me so fuming since I never get world gem this good
Aah. Terraria. My childhood game
Me: &quot;omygosh he already found a shrine? If he doesn&#39;t get Arkh-&quot;<br>Pewdiepie: <b>gets enchanted sword</b><br>Me: God<br><br><br><br>What have you done to this poor man
Me (Old terrarian) seeing the Enchanted sword :How lucky..
WHAT      WHAT       WHAT       WHAT

Pewds: Brah theres penguins! <br><b>Chops its head off</b><br>Pewds: Thats so cool!
Aww I miss this game, I&#39;ve quitted playing this since 2017 I think, I don&#39;t know how to play this rn
DONT GK DOWN!
IOVE
I love how insanely lucky pewds gets in certain video games.
Remember in the beginning of the series when pewds said zero deaths it&#39;s changed a lot already.
Dam Felix is so much more adventurous and brave in games then I am.
He had more luck than me, so sucks &gt;:(
even i cant find an enchanted sword for my Zenith yet in 1.4
there was litterally a water bolt above the door into the dungeon..
I know Cthullu from Lovecraft, when they said &quot;The Eye of Cthullu&quot; I imagined some really creepy and demonic stuff with floating darkness and a lot of tentacles coming out. And it&#39;s just a floating regular eye ball LMAOOO
This video somehow recommended in my list🤔🤔🤔u 2?
Felix: It&#39;s a slime, it can&#39;t hurt me<br>King Slime: Am I a joke to you?
Pewds: kills eye of cthulu   <br>Also pewds: <b>gets killed by king slime</b>
Where jojo
Pewds you saved Minecraft you can save terraria too
Who tf he talking to tho
Pewds have waterbolt in his dungeon in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=833">13:53</a>
It took me a year of grinding and digging in this game to find the damn sword and you found it so quickly!! How??! Well, you deserve it
YOU NEED TO BE ON EXPERT FOR THE LOOT WHEN YOU KILL A BOSS
Gets the enchanted sword<br><br>Veteran: Cool

o so ye give the svedish mane le enchanted sworde but not me oke
Terraria: screens echo around you<br>Felix: cool<br>Me: lmao it would be funny if he destroyed all the orbs
More terraria
But cool you got a light saber
WHY DID YOU WE SAID NO.
OMG ThAT IS A SKELETON HEAD...!!!
You cant mine obsidian while you have low class pickaxe
More terraia
this series has such Adventure Time vibes
So many players must’ve been triggered when Felix was one orb away from the Eater of Worlds.<br>Less triggered when he had the piercing space gun though.
the fact he isn&#39;t playing in expert mode triggers me
How cool would it have been if he had gotten the arkhallis
I love terraria
Looser pewdiepie
pewdiepie
The gun sounds like cha cha real smooth
He killed a bunny
everyone:veteran<br>me:vegeterian???
He’s such a noob
I hate the mining helmet just because it doesnt give good armor and gives a small light like i just use a light pet
He didn&#39;t notice the water bolt outside the dungeon
Felix: kills eye of chuthu <br><br>Also felix: almost dies to zombies
im surprised he was able to kill the eye with a sword
I like how excited he gets over snow. Just wait until he gets into hard mode and finds the hallow. :)
Pixelings 😃
Good Job king slime&gt;=) REVENGE!!!
Bruuu the ooddx s are with him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=220">3:40</a>
Looking at how little damage the eater of worlds does makes me remember the good old days of normal mode
Felix: <b>defeats eoc with an enchanted sword</b><br><br><br>Me, a veteran, having beginning hardmode weapons, literally running from a frickin&#39; unicorn: <b>that thing is literally gonna devour my soul</b>
Me:trolling pewds <br>Me:relized that im not a veteran <br>Me: ... <br>Me:deletes comment*
The enchanted sword
The way he said, &quot;Why did you not tell me?&quot; is just amazing.
When pewdiepie kills the eye of cuthulu but cannot defeat the king slime : bruv ._.
Pewds: Everyone is saying no don&#39;t go down there<br>Also Pewds: WHY DIDN&quot;T ANYONE TELL MEEEEEEE
Why did Felix&#39;s facecam turn off later in the video
Fun fact Terraria is finite not infinite there is an end its just really really really far away.
I dunno why but how do pewdiepie gets almost all rare things. I played terraria a year ago and cant even find a pink slime
I just relized that his user name is peepee
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=1113">18:33</a> <br>pewds:hey squirrel <br>squirrel: <b>nervous sweating</b>
Could you imagine if he got Arkhalis first time at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEMzUd3Tns&amp;t=221">3:41</a>
Imagine he got Arkalis
i know this is the wrong time but Pewdiepie you should have gone fishing for the reaver shark to get obsidan to mine the metorite like if u agree
Imagine if he was in expert mode 😂😂
I just realized from watching this how overprepared for the eye I was I had meteor gear and the minishark and a whole arena when I fought the eye
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh press CTRL when mining :O
I Miss Pewd&#39;s playing this game 😢
Chat: dont do it<br>Pewds: dies<br>Also pewds:WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME!!!
