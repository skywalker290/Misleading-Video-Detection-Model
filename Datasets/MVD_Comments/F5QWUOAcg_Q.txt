Is the ok 👌 sign ruined by the white supremacists?
WPWW
Or a 3 pointer?
God bless everyone and have a good day!,.
Ah the jet set radio music
Sounds ok until you actually think about this argument for more than 10 minutes.
documemtary pewps
👌🏻 white power and ok symbol 👌🏻
He clickbaited me but I’m 👌 with it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=265">4:25</a> another 🐸 <b>PEPE</b> 🐸
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=171">2:51</a> but from thee ashes of PEPE.....<br><b>CAME SOMETHING FAR WORSE!</b> 👌
This is what happens when people give in &amp; don&#39;t push back.
Milk is a hate symbol according to the ADL because white people can drink it but Jews are largely lactose intolerant...
what&#39;s the music that played at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=26">0:26</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=290">4:50</a>?
What the hell does &#39;co-opted&#39; mean?
The swastika represents the 4 seasons!!
Bro I forgot pewds was the one talking
Can we get more these mr internet man? I had fun...
back in 2020 my brother had the ok hand as a zoom background as a joke. He had no idea that it was a hate sign. Eventually a teacher noticed it and talked to him as well as making him change his background.
Thumbs up is also an offensive sign in Iran which means “sit on it” an indecent and offensive insult
🐸
Thanks PewDiePie! This was really helpful. And you&#39;re right about stuff like this becoming what we allow it to be come. <br>Great job☺👌☺👍👵🤜🤛😎
Wow, I didn&#39;t expect a serious and thoughtful analysis of something out of Pewds... Bravo
This is not okay
Ok👌
This entire subject is hilarious and so petty. In my town a certain group of people thought that any not tied on a plastic bag represented a noose. LOL
The real story is pepe was a 4chan meme and didn&#39;t like how it was popular on reddit and other normie places, so they made pepe into something that would scare people, so they would avoid using the meme.
Idk why I loved this video it was pretty cool. I have never seen Pewds be like this for a particular video but this really had to be talked about. Damn lol xD.
Nice pewdiepie the n word user and anti semite is now lecturing about pepe being hateful
Pepe, was imprisoned by the nazis, and  was killed in jail. At least they let him out for the funeral.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=380">6:20</a> the swastika is a Buddhist symbol and we still use it. Its seen in temples and buddhist schools.
👌
The lesson here: people will get mad at anything, justified or otherwise
i cook wokes in my wok
Yep, still relevant today 👌🏻💯%
so basically people are saying that ok sign is bad symbol making bad people want to use it, and at the same time making people who like it as a joke get mad at the accusors
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=379">6:19</a> Pewds, you&#39;re Scandinavian, you should know that the &quot;Fylfot&quot; is as old as Proto-Vikings and cavemen. Found all over the world. The Hindu flavor Buddhism is relatively late in using it.
The left wing is crazy
hmm... Why is all this bs happen in U.S?
👌
Just say that it&#39;s a BLM symbol viewed from above
Peace among worlds! 🖕
So stupid....so trolled.  People will believe anything.
Pepe is saved the right wing frog is pepes final form to beat the rainbow mafia
🆗️🆗️🆗️🆗️🆗️
Ok sign is hate symbol<br>While Indians: (while doing head bubble)ha ha very👌(nice).
The trump photo guy really made ha ha made you look sign and he was successful everybody looked.<br><br>All i see is people trolling by saying Ha ha made you look in videos and pictures.
Woke West: Swastika is a hate symbol.<br>India and Japan: <b>Bruh</b>
welcome to another day in ✨humanity ✨
👌
This is actually my favorite PewDiePie video of all time.
Pepe is bad
Rip Italians. 🤣
Damn, pewds is definitely big brain on this video
XYZ, abcd
No
anyone know what the name of the song is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=300">5:00</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=360">6:00</a>
My English professor just went off on a kid in my class who talked about Pepe in his paper…
👌👌
How does marzia feel about this. Doesn’t she do 👌🏼👌🏼
2030: youtuber pewdiepie proved to  be white supremacist by shameful word said called &quot;hi&quot;<br>I am disgusted
🥛
The most interesting videos of Felix have the most random titles
I can see <b>the thumb of one race</b> actually being a real thing…hopefully i’m wrong
That child that threw up the &#39;ok&#39; symbol was obviously indoctrinated by the adult racist into hating their own race. 😡
Matt Furie acting like he invented Microsoft. But c&#39;mon bruh, it&#39;s just an anthropomorphized frog...
dude pewdepie was in a cartoon bro fist from pewdepie was created in teen titans go but i think they still did not remove it even if some ppl say its a hate simble
when he showed Pepe I heard someone  shouting and it felt like he was saying pepe
The media can be convinced that a high five is a hate sign
<b>u wot m8</b>  👌
👌
I love when pewd makes these very rare creative vids. Even the matrix vid was so damn different but was so relaxing
a little late but the funniest thing about the whole &quot;Ok sign&quot; white power thing is that it&#39;s always a white person complaining about it being a dog whistle for White power. I haven&#39;t seen a person of colour actually complain about the ok sign being an offensive method of displaying your support for white supremacists
I never heard this white supremacy symbol, we used it all the time here.
I now declare American Media Full of Idiots in my brain.
😂😂😂😂😂 the thumb of one race Aaah man that was so funny
XYZ 👌
Anyone else think Felix should narrate books on audible or something?
What melody is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=290">4:50</a> ?
What was the backround music, it sounds very nostalgic. Is it from jet set radio?
Good to know that D-Von Dudley, a black wrestler has been flashing the &quot;White Power&quot; sign for over 20 years.
I want more content like this
This video is pretty 👌
R.i.p pepe😪😥🐸
We love Pepe
Great takes
👊
One pepe to end them all
You know what? The Mayans were right. 2012 did happen. But not the way you think. <br><br>Slowly but surely people have been offended by the absolute stupidest things.
👌🐸👊
Pepe
pepe the frog to pepega to nfsmw pepega mod
I&#39;m going to die
I love Pewds
This is so cool I want this more
snowflakes
You know what the strangest thing is? The fact that these people allow symbols to be defined by white supremacists, rather than the other way around. Why on earth would you treat the opinions of Nazis, who believe that the Holocaust never happened, as even the slightest bit true?
The bowl hair cut Is a hate symbol well Now i get why i had no freinds when i was 6
With how stupid the media is. Soon, Rick rolling will turn into a hate sign..
ok hand gesture added to the hate symbol list<br>Divers: guess Ill die
the start of the video is just <b>chef kiss</b>
🖐 is a hate symbol now because you not doing about  anything  bad things happening. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hahahaha
Didn&#39;t watch the video the first time through, came back to finish it after thinking about it more, and I agree, I think this video of yours contained truths that some people who are very invested in current american politics would rather ignore.
👌👌👌

Racism in my opinion is just wrong and obsolete. Its also overused and at this point I personally feel is a crutch sometimes. I&#39;ve seen people claim racism just to spite someone who isn&#39;t even a racist. I&#39;m Hispanic grew up around black people and just about every other ghetto demographic and not a single slur bothers me because I choose not to give it the light of day. Sensitivity is our issue and bad people know it so they&#39;re gonna take advantage of that to ruin what good we have. If we just stop letting the racism effect us and maybe harden ourselves a little bit there won&#39;t be any energy for these bad people to feed off of. Moral of the story grow tf up and get over some shit because its gonna end up getting worse and you may end up being a better person in life for letting something so trivial as racism go. Slavery has been abolished all around (Colombians which I am were also slaves during the banana wars but you don&#39;t see me saying kill whiteys) though it still happens with human trafficking and what not I think our goal should be to stop feeding power to these terrible people and one way to do that is to not give a fuck about what they say racist or not. Like bullying eventually it stops if you take the right steps to chew through it. Let&#39;s grow together instead of tearing this world apart please
It’s a cartoon frog...people are giving this much influence to a FUCKING CARTOON FROG!!!
So I don’t know when but I know this was  before 2020 because I was in school, anyway I was in gym getting pictures and  I making the ok sign and they told to stop so I did, and now knowing this I’m hoping that if one day I ever get famous I hope it doesn’t gets find
👍🏻
Least he didn’t mention moon man
People are pretty stupid<br>Frog? More like racist<br>Ok sign? More like racist
a
COOL 👊👊👊👊👊👊
Eu sei que você veio parar aqui desesperado, jornaleiro do JN. 😅
Swastika is an Indian symbol mostly used in our culture. Stfu western media
Well, its 2021 now. Now we&#39;ve got staff from Bolsonaro doing this purposefully while deaths in Brazil reach exactly 300000 people.<br>Maybe it&#39;s time to reevaluate? Or nah<br>Internet culture is what it is. It adapts over random criteria and basically behaves like metastatic cancer. It&#39;s not traceable. But chemotherapy or radiotherapy does exist.
No you
Superstraight is the newest 4chan troll campaign and tik tok is spoon feeding 4chan reactions
Its a fuckin frog, its a fuckin hand!
Lmao and people still believe those news channels.
Truly the before pewdiepie came
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=542">9:02</a> why do we have a capibara passing judgment on people&#39;s ideals?
Hahaha<br>A society that wants to destroy people&#39;s lives because they made an OK sign and you complaining about your little Bro Fisting? You&#39;re all peas in a pond.
👌🏿👌🏾👌🏽👌🏼👌🏻🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸ಠ‿ಠಠ‿ಠ
Wow how truly introspective. Someone killed 51 innocent people in your name. Take some responsibility. If Neonazis are overwhelmingly using a symbol, it becomes a symbol for neonaziism. That simple.
Good video nice to see common sense in this time, where common sense is lacking.
The title got me XD
That moment where 4chan is above the goverment
👌
People are bloody stupid...
i like this style of video
I would still use the Bro fist 👊
See how much nicer the world could be if we all used the inside of our head like Felix?
Wait so I&#39;m actually White not Asian?
We are BROFIST👊🏻
Who else noticed the dr. Mario music
The Swastika is also &quot;just a symbol.&quot;
I can&#39;t watch this video all at once my blood is starting to boil
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=364">6:04</a> wait? There’s no sive?
What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccckkkk is the world coming to?
It was a troll at first but It is being used now by white supremacists all over the world and acting like it isn&#39;t definitely isn&#39;t helping the situation.
👌🏻
Such an underrated video
The news are really wack these times
Bro first is going down
What a beautiful life to be a person who thought an OK sign, pepe, and brofist are supposed to be a hate symbol, I just don’t get it Karen and Kevin. 😑
Person: <b>breathes</b><br>Media: NO!!! THAT&#39;S * insert dumb Karen reason as to why breathing is bad here * 🚫❌🚫❌🚫❌🚫
This is the most serious PewDiePie video I&#39;ve ever seen
What sign do i use when I go diving now?
WHY THE CRABS MAN
👌🏽
Someone make cnn symbol become racist lol
congrats US, u out stupided ur self<br>(ik stupided isn&#39;t a word but idc)
Yo pewds i love you but, you know you&#39;re being like a useful idiot for these white supremacists don&#39;t you? They want people to believe that is &quot;just trolling bruh&quot; and use it so that if they get caught, everyone who points it just be called hysterical. You do remember Richard Spencer saying that Pepe became a symbol just before being punched in the face, so to say they are spread and used because of media report is just stupid, not denying the possibility of people doing it just for trolling but to say people were using just for the keks doesn&#39;t make sense.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=292">4:52</a> Klubbas theme from donkey kong 2 lol
I thought the thumb and and the pointer finger was an o and the others is a k
and they say political correctness after the 90&#39;s isn&#39;t a problem.
Pewds should really make more of these
It&#39;s just so cool that Pewds does these occasional types of videos, it&#39;s like a specialized therapy just to even out the chaotic humor :)
For those people still wanting to know what the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=26">0:26</a> is: It&#39;s a Jet Grind Radio Soundtrack - Humming the Bassline. You&#39;re welcome, have a great day!
ITS AN OK HAND SIMBOL U ACTUALL DUMS
ITS AN OK HAND SIMBOL U ACTUALL DUMS
Pls make more things like this
This feels like a documentary.
why is the bro fist a hate symbol again?
Based
Groot scares me
4chan did it.
Okay handsign is a hate symbol<br><br>The letter F in sign language: 🤭
Is this a documentary from pewds???
we live in a society.
NEWS: Pepe is saved by Peepo Animation
someone: breathes<br>some kid on the internet: THAT&#39;S OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE HOLDING THEIR BREATH
ayo please make another video like this, i watched it a year back and i rewatched it again today
If anything exists it the media immediately says it means white power or white supremacy or some other racist sounding bullshit.
i caught an ok symbol in a zach king vine and zach king did it!!!!
Get flexed on wignat
Wait, why is Harry Potter talking about hate symbols?
12 was my favourite number it is the best number now
Lmfao, I know a black guy who does the 👌 joke all the time. Why are there so many SJWs in this world?
Reasons i fucking hate people
i love 4chan, it creates so much retardation. <br>i absolutely hate the UI of the site tho.
One year later I am finally finding out this apparently meant white supremacy 😂
All this is meaningless to me, I have a post-racial mind.
media: pepe is hate symbol<br>Hong Kong freedom protesters: haha pepe go brrrrr
👌
Big brain I got what you said 😂
Me: 👌<br><b>*FBI wants to know your location.*</b>
This is why i like 4 chan
&#39;Ok hand sign is offensive&#39;<br>EmKay: 👀👀
nice clickbait
Pewds is actually an amazing host of a documentary channel
I&#39;m done with humanity. Like are divers using the 👌 supposed to be white supremacist
The ok sign is also the universal diving sign for being ok
wtf
The news is stupid they think that pepe the frog is a hate symbol they should abolish the news because there doing it for money
just imagine someone whos deaf and uses sign language doing the ok sign  and him just getting beat up
The OK sign was flashed by the Christchurch shooter, who killed 50 people. He wasn&#39;t trolling. This video misconstrues how hate symbols work.
People got offended really quick these days like they can&#39;t even take a joke<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>👌 Haha
Today marks the 1 year anniversary of this upload
But what about the bowl haircut? How is that a hate symbol?
Resurrect pepe
This is the 1 problem with diversity: if ppl do almost any action, there will always be that one group of ppl or person that find it offensive. Soon saying &quot;hello&quot; will be racist because it supports white supremacy. So dumb
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=348">5:48</a> i dont think he was trying to flash the sign on public news, but just one of my crazy conspiracy theories/
The media did it

Why is the media always putting bull shit in symbols and the symbols become bad
Me: goes for a punch<br>That one kid: OMG hate crime!!!!
If anyone got bad vibes in my last comments I meant it a good way sorry if anyone misunderstood it
I will make my house a bro fist no matter the damage it does
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Justice for 👌and👊<br><br><br><br>peace ✌
i think we people need to start ignoring the hate symbol and speech list as it clearly turns anything into something it&#39;s not.
Pepe is nothing compared no my papa<br><br><br><br><br><br>Papa franku
I hate people that do this with memes
Now I know why people is laughing when I do the ok hand gesture

now there are at least 6 million people that know the truth about pepe and the ok symbol and that they completely innocent and ok to use
👌👌👌👌👌👌
do 2 ok symbols, now close 2 fingers except the index thumb and middle, turn the one upsidedown now you have brown power
This is humanity we’re talking about pretty soon it’s gonna be offensive to be alive.
It&#39;s meeeeee😋
THE ok hand is the demon sign its  666 👌 this emoji is hiding the last finger so it&#39;s not demonetized its an optical illusion
Seriously I don&#39;t know why these Boomers even bother thinking they know shit in the current world
👌 gottem

We need more content like this..
What the hell&#39;s going on here
Its all cnn and msnbc
I feel so bad for em kay
Why did clickbait me
In my contry
I hope idiots realise that the OK sign is the ok sign not a racist symbol. These lies give a bad meaning to it even if it was normal. I hope they realise that the more they repeat this the more power racists will have. Also ik im 11 months late to this.

World: it isn&#39;t racist<br><br>Also world when someone does it:
Welcome to meme world
Alright these guys are pretty regarded thinking the ok 👌 sign is white power like how do you think that?

You think this is worse? The OK symbol is banned because people think its White Power<br>In Indonesia the word &#39;Anjay&#39; is banned because they say its offensive. When it is supposed to be a compliment, sometimes people are just not thinking and tearing their nations apart.<br><br>Edit: If that was offensive then why does Android Phones and iPhones have this symbol 👌👌🏻
What&#39;s a hate symbol is subbing to the CEO of YouTube.
<b>slaps the table</b><br>This is why I hate humanity

I swear to god USA gets dumber and dumber with every passing second.
I honestly never knew this,Thanks for the meme education poods👊🏻🙌🏻
People who advocate censorship are no different from fascists. The people getting upset at these symbols are the very threat they claim to fight against.
The news don’t really care about the meaning, the6 just want their story.
B.<br>The number 12.
If you get upset by this game you are a sissy
Loving the new format. Keep this going!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wait...
Okay hand sign guy was not the white supremacist.<br>1 supremacist remains.
I hate people read take thing too seriously it&#39;s like  We&#39;re just trying to be funny and it doesn&#39;t even mean what is in there is little evidence but now you&#39;re in a try to call us out for no reason we&#39;re just trying to be funny
I actually got the 1st question
Pepe is not really dead the creator said he is waiting for the word that Pepe means happy and no <br>More mean pepes
He is going down on history as the man who stood up for memes..👊

How dumb are we?
Yo, when he gotcha, he gotcha, he gotta brofist you with much force.<br>But seriusly if I had to be in a war, I would pick PewDiePie&#39;s side.
i love videos like this where they sound like a documentary on memes
The government, am I right🤦‍♂️
Please, Jesus wept, please (I&#39;m not religious, just a turn of phrase) but Felix is a nice affable, erudite and seemed learned human doesn&#39;t mean you take his word for gospel (truth).  He&#39;s trying - with humour, to encourage you to think for yourselves.  I for one enjoy the videos I have a chance to see.... but, formulate your own views. Nowt else to say.  Diolch yn fawr
Rip pepe
This guy is so funny and jokey but when he wants to find out about some thing he can really get the point across
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=296">4:56</a> what is the backraund music

Pewdiepie lowkey looks hella good
The ok sign is also scuba diving sign language, rather than using thumbs up which means head to the surface, the ok symbol means everything is ok. So by the logic of this is that all scuba divers are white supremacists

title &amp; thumbnail: brofist is racist<br>video itself: OK sign is racist<br><br>clickbait at its finest
Ok 👌
It’s a hate a symbol until we make it a Pewdiepie symbol
It looked like riot logo
Man, people get offended by fingers?
pog
the people thinking its a real hate sign, are the same people destroying portland for 100 days etc etc. rarted clowns
👌
Swastik came from Hinduism
We miss you pepe
Now this is some og content
I know everyone here is either 9 or 19, but please watch a movie called Waiting from 2005. It&#39;s got Ryan Reynolds in it before Deadpool. Thanks, I will go boomer now
I dont think we will be able to evwn colonize mars with this much stupidity in out planet
pepe is on mah discord :P
Did they actually blur the ok hand gesture wtf.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pepe
I know that frog as the bot dank memer on discord
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=320">5:20</a> imagine being tracked down over an ok sign
&quot;By acting angry and upset about these things, you are giving validity to the symbol&quot;<br><br>I wish I knew that back when I was offended by cancer jokes
This is just boomers criticizing all the new things and resisting change<br><br>Except the versions of pepe that never should&#39;ve been made
I mean if you think about it bandannas were turned into a heat symbol because they’ve been associated with gangs and robberies over the years so that’s how they were kind of turned into a hate symbol
12, Blowl cut, 👌 (just kidding, love your channel)
Don&#39;t be racist we are all even

Conclusion : parents and politicians are dumb as they thinks memes and video games are bad
Danm riot must be feeling dumb right about now
its ok boomer
me : does the ok symbol<br>also me : wait why do i hear knocking.<br>FBI : helo
Imagine a deaf person being arrested for genuinely saying ok. I don’t get how white power is a hate symbol but black lives matter isn’t. I’m just saying that it’s pretty similar.
👊
Clickbait thx
he is back.
I will forever circle ⭕ and okay sign people. Never ending it. Okay sign stands for I&#39;m okay I will dominate your butthole.
The news just love turning the tables. But they trolled themselves with looking in it and talking about it, cuz you usually just laugh or make an annoyed face. (btw I know I&#39;m late)

Pepe is a symbol of Hong Kong freedom movement now so Pepe&#39;s not dead, he&#39;s doing fine
&quot;The ok sign means white power&quot;<br>Bruh thats like saying the high five means Fuck you
The adl is a white supremacy group

Someone : <b>THE OK SYMBOL IS OF WHITE SUPREMACY!!!</b><br><br>Me : then explain this<br><br><br><br><br>👌🏿
Swastikas were used all over Europe and Asia even before Buddhism

The Emojis are liek<br><br>Im keepin it Frick it 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
You have stopped all hate signed
Okey -_- 👌
I love how history repeats itself, ever heard of the red scare or McCarthyism same rules apply when people go around virtue signaling thinking there&#39;re doing the right thing but don&#39;t consider the consequences of their actions
the &quot;circle game&quot; has a rule where it has to be &quot;below the waist&quot;. pointing the fingers downwards literally means &quot;asshole&quot; in American<br>Sign Language. (look it up. fact check true) It was a way to say, &quot;look at my asshole&quot; as in &quot;try and hit this.&quot; Catching someone looking below your waist meant they were checking you out, and thus you could hit them... Unless they were able to poke their index finger in the ring and break the circle. (tear you a new one). In which case, they could hit you for attempting to present a target.<br>TL;DR<br>3 fingers up, index touching thumb is American Sign Language (ASL) for &quot;OK&quot;.  <br>3 fingers down, index touching thumb is ASL for &quot;asshole&quot;. <br>combine the 2 for &quot;OK, asshole&quot;<br><br>poking your index finger repeatedly into an inverted &quot;ok&quot; sign actually means what you think it means in ASL.<br><br>The circle game was a kids&#39; game, so it taught kids to be on the look out for pedos. <br>Also taught them what to do when they found one (hit them, or else you win &quot;a new one&quot;).<br>This is how it was taught to me, back in the 80s (like the timeframe of &quot;the Goldbergs&quot;).<br>If there&#39;s a different explanation, please let me know.<br><br>More fun facts:<br>Middle finger up, pinky, ring and index curled in = ASL for &quot;fuck you&quot; or &quot;where is tall man?... Here I am&quot;.  <br>Index finger up, all other fingers closed in = ASL for &quot;one&quot;.<br>&quot;One&quot; symbol repeatedly poking other hand&#39;s palm (with other hand open, fingers pointing up) = ASL for &quot;cock blocking&quot;.<br>&quot;one&quot; symbol repeatedly poking tip of other hand&#39;s &quot;one&quot; symbol = ASL for &quot;gay&quot;.<br>hand in a fist is rock or &quot;bro fist&quot; invitation.<br>open hand palm facing down or with thumb up is paper or handshake invitation.<br>Index and middle finger extended, all others closed is scissors, when the fingers point up, it means &quot;two&quot; or &quot;peace&quot;<br>thumbs up means yes or okay, or online &quot;like&quot;.<br>thumbs down means no or dislike.<br>thumbs up resting on top of other hand (open fingers with palm up) means &quot;help&quot;.<br>open hand, touch front of chin, then pointing fingers of open hand to someone means &quot;Thank you&quot;<br>Bro fist = ASL for &quot;Ula Britta Smitta Fritta&quot; or &quot;the furniture is assembled, zero deaths, you&#39;re welcome.&quot;

2040: love is now a hate crime and very offensive.
everything has to be racially charged these days smh why cant ppl just get along
Lets pretend that the earth is actually roun...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Pointless comment for pointless people
Guess the meme 👌🧓
Is she Sarah silverman aka the voice of wreck it ralph girl
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Pepe

He protecc <br>He attacc <br>But most importantly...<br><br><br><br><br><br>Bring the BroFist bacc
I keep telling my dad this and me calls me an idiot and says its all fake and won&#39;t stop hitting me
Pewdiepie.. the hero we don&#39;t deserve.. but the hero we need.
watching this stressed me out <br><br>can&#39;t believe people are this stupid
Let’s make the Democrats logo into a hate symbol
PEpE iS a WhiTe SupREmAcy SYmBol
All adults trying to figure out a way to fuck up simple shit
Pewds out here saving all of the meme lords in 1 vid
Most of these are hate symbols specifically because of 4chan. The power of trolling has become too powerful.
That crab conveyor belt is actually really sad
The bowl haircut is a hate symbol to my eyes
I’m guessing all three are hate symbols<br><br>EDIT: I’ve never been so disappointed in being right
Finally someone who actually has evidence to back up their claim
👌
Pepe was co-opted but by Trump supporters. I&#39;ve never seen a white supremacist posting a pepe meme. I agree that white supremacists probably support Trump but so do many others.
The hell they gonna charge the ok-ers for hurt feelings?
we could actually not give an F about what they say and continue our daily lives on the Internet<br><br>Media: How bout I ban it :)?
Well Played
respect for the jsr music
this video was great.
&quot;think being arrested for say ok&quot;
People are so stupid
Memes son 👌
Wut da fa....
Don&#39;t touch my Pepe
B I N O D
Damm Our School must be racist then
Im not even white but I use the OK symbol all the time! Does that mean I can&#39;t make that symbol at all? Smh...
👌🏿
Everyfink is reycest my dudes
This is clickbait
But I feel OK most the time so this makes me angry 😡 😡 if people think it is racists (this is the Ok symbol 👌 it means OK..   Are you stupid people all colours use OK. But some people want people to get told off for using ok are mean (this is the brofist 🤜.) but this is waving 👋. 🤔😭😭😭🤔😭😭😭🤮🤮😰😰👎👎👎👎🤝💪🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️😭
So if we spam a persons face they become a hate symbol right?
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Sooo thats what happend to the frog 🐸
These boomers need to chill out
👌
I honestly don’t even consider the “hate signals” as hate signals.
Nice vid Pewds. 👌🏻
Whyyyyyyyy!? 😭
it feels like the media hates fun or something
Hey pepe is still in jesse background
OMFG in Hungari we use 👌to say it is fucking good bro lik the hit dog that you eating at the moment.
12
I guess all divers are white supremacist.
Rip
👌
👌
in my country when you shake ur hand while doing the ok hand sign it is usually used for kids meaning &quot;im gonna beat u&quot;  (not actually)
Wp   haha got em sry im bad person
IF YOU ARE GONNA LIE ABOUT THE BROFIST I UNSUB
If the ones reporting weren&#39;t complete robots and didn&#39;t go along with every script they&#39;re giving and would say this is wrong the world would be a better place
👊👊👊👊👊
Is pewds a fuzzy wool thing that goes Baa?
XDDDDDD those memes
Thanks pewdz for this video
Wait how did I not hear about all the controversy over this 👌
now its a symbol of equality<br>epic.
Soon the color white will be a hate symbol
If the ok hand gesture has something to do with  w  p  why not mean<br>will<br>power
why are news people so dum why they belive
Hahaha love the jet set radio music 😊😊
i unironicallly use the ok gesture multiple times and is still using it till this day
When there is no problem, create one
Everything was fine and game till the boomers decided that its offensive
Beginning of the video: Music<br>Me: N O S T A L G I A
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌hahahaahhahahah made you look lollololololololo!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I thought it was the ok sign
Its time for the third impact
Dank memer is really<br>Like...<br><br>Dank memer:Want some Flesh?<br><br>Piglin:YOU STOOPID<br><br><b>stabs</b>
👌
Wow she said that he Flash the upside down okay sign which means white power which is ridiculous because it up because that would be an mb not a wp, and that actually stands for mhite bower, not white power. Silly dinguses
The human mind is amazing! for achieving iq in the negative zone, that is a scientific breakthrough
2021: the thumbs hand sign is racist
Bro can people take a fricking joke
what is the song playing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=292">4:52</a> ?
👌👌👌
So anything fun is offensive and since when is Pepe offensive memes were made to bring joy into life not destroy it
I can&#39;t wait for the boomers to die so we can fix the world
Poope
This has so much to do with what&#39;s going on with the moderators of the animemes subreddit.<br>They&#39;ve recently banned anyone who uses the word &quot;trap&quot; for really silly reasons
biggest click bait?
My whole school likes to troll and do the ok symbol LIKE 48 TIMES A DAY
John Cena after the ok symbol is declared a hate symbol: <b>sweats profusely</b>
A, fuck i was wrong
👌
<b>Ah shit, here we go again.</b>
NO. Not the bro fist!
No disrespect. But what the Frick? No Dark humor these days?😒😒😒
You know... in my place, the &quot;haha i got you&quot; joke we used instead of the ok sign, we used the italian hand sign where all the fingers go above the palm
Give us back our pepe frog and all our memes. &gt;:(
I will save the pepe.
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
These people (those people who says that this friendly nohing symbol is bad) is literally getting money by demonitizing the community
well uh it’s 2020 now and this is in my recommendations, but people are taking our memes, can old and overly white people stop using the internet? ty
Me: thinking haha spam 👌=funny<br>Pewds: reads my mind<br>Me :o
o o f<br><b>c l i c k b a i t</b>
sooo. no more bro fist? saad dude
me: :ok hand:<br>friend: dude wtf<br>also me: <b>*Visible confusion*</b>
So any meme is considerd a hate symbol
Of course the OK sign means White Supremacy, WHY NOT?
Hey that’s CNN they think everything is a hate symbol.
I hate twitter.
Why is That everything funny is ruined by politics
Who actually takes the adl seriously?
Nice dig dug music
Swedish blonde peter parker with a slight beard is his nickname for me
You should make more content like this I really enjoyed it

This is what happens when memes reach main stream
i swear any hand signal is a hate symbol <br>isnt the OK symbol for italians when they say the meal is good?<br>next thumbsup is gonna be a hate symbol <br>and pointing is a hate symbol  <br>Having 5 fingers out a hate symbol <br>Making a fist a hate symbol <br><br>This is the Media in a Decade

👌 chill people its alright

anyone associated with the president: does something<br>fake news media: omg racist symbol, trump is a racist, Biden 2020.<br>this is literally how long it takes for media to blame trump.
This is why I like being a texan not an american but a texan btw for you preds I&#39;ve moved from texas

I like how this is all stems from AMERICA 🤦‍♂️
Imagine trying to tell someone your okay  but then all of a sudden someone comes out and punches the shit out of you
This is bloody disgusting my friends suffered so much because of that i made you look crap
The whole ok hand being a hate symbol sounds like a bad comeback for someone who just lost the circle game.
not gonna lie one of my favourite vids
<b>Long live Pepe</b>
The media is like a karen, you do something, and they say that its offensive
<b>anger</b> in this video he used the universal hate symbol known throughout the galaxy as hate 😡😡😡😡😡
I used the ok sign 👌 just as a circle bait or actually like a flashy thing, a goldy thing, valuable things, like &quot;this is the finest of the finest(but mostly I do it sarcastically)&quot;. For me 👌= ✨so I always perceive it as that
I have officialy been clickbaited (no hate)
👌👌👌wait but I&#39;m Mexican so that means it&#39;s 👌👌👌 ok?
Bro I&#39;m coming to school doing ok
Pewds should do an actual Netflix documentary series, fr
You know you messed up when PewDiePie says something about this problem.
Pepe is a white nationalist symbol... ok lol
👌👌👌👌 this is not a god dam White power sign its just a fucking ok sing!!!
wait what haha hold on<br>apologies for my ignorance, I don&#39;t live in america, but since fucking when the ok symbol is a hate symbol... what in the world??<br>never heard of that one before
Geez people are sensitive now huh
Best psa
I hate this country
👌
Deep thoughts with PewDiePie
👌👌👌👌
OMFG
I blame american for making brofist hate symbol. Gosh american had enough
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=542">9:02</a> That face looks like someone who would believe any obvious garbage thrown at her.
Bad times creat strong men and strong men create good times and good times create weak men and weak men create bad times
And all pepole who cant talk cant tell they ok
Why is the USA so dumb omfg xD
Everything nowadays is hate symbols
Person: <b>*turns the bro fist into a hate symbol*</b><br>Me: Why are u gay?
👌
Love the soundtrack from jet set radio. Also, i hate the news, they&#39;ve manipulated so many people, some of those people are my friends sadly.. :(
👊is never  going to go by
👊is never  going to go by
as a normal person, this triggers me A LOT.
He did the double shoulder shrug😯
It’s the Karen’s man
Man, humans are dumb sometimes.
what&#39;s the music from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=288">4:48</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=357">5:57</a> ??
Pew die pie do other documentaries this was amazing
Honestly I think this video well showcases how media loves reporting and exaggerating things they don’t understand
WHY DOES THE MEDIA HAVE TO RUIN EVERYTHING
wait a frog is what now
i had my computer wallpaper as pepe the frog not a variation of pepe just pepe and she got made so im going to send this to her
I cant see why the Okay symbol is bad, its used as a international symbol by divers to ask &#39;Are you Okay?&#39; and the same symbol is used to answer &#39;I am Okay&#39;. The fact they made it a hate symbol even after it was confirmed to be a fake WP movement is seriously dumb.
Are people this dumb??? Humanities respect= -10000000000
The feminist fist (aka black power fist) has become a favorite sign of white supremacists.......sucks huh?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=285">4:45</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=25">0:25</a> what are these songs
I agree with pewds its retarded how people ruin innocent memes and jokes and then the offensive people and the sensitive people both perpetuate it until it is cancelled. Everyone should get their facts right and stop being sensitive or offensive about dumb shit.
👌🏻 <b>PUNCHES YOU</b>
Man you can&#39;t do any hand signs anymore
I hate whoever thought the (O.K.) symbol is hate. It clearly stands for &quot;gottem&quot;
Media: both white people and terrorists drink water....<br>Also media: Coincidence? I THINK NOT!
👌
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
I live in Illinois and my dads friend is the attorney that represents the guy that made the OK Sign at the cubs game and he got banned for life from wriggled field. Idk if they called it back or not.
👌ok boomer
rick rolling : ok<br>ok hand : OMG SO BADDD
the ok meme will live on forever and i do it 10 times a day atleast
Even black kids at my school do the ok sign 👌👌
Boomer:👌 this is bad <br>The internet:ok boomer
Man what did do wrong...
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
everything’s hateful, and i wouldnt be surprised if “bless you” became a sentence of hate
Boomers sayin that u cant have fun
👌
This video hasn’t been demonetised wow
my question is when the heck did doing the middle finger get declared rude
nice pirates f the caribbean scene
ha gotchu
Hey hey you <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>👌 gottem

This is so sad Alexa play despacito
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=364">6:04</a> he look like pewd from 2016
This kind of thing is one of the great filters that we human must face before we can ascent to the next stage of civilization but it seems like we have failed to overcome this simple great filter. Humanity will eventually extinct.
If Pepe is a white nationalist symbol, then the hammer is a symbol of socialism and you’re a communist if you use one.
What did this have to do with the bro fist tho
When are you doing subnatica
Well I thought the title was real but ok
🐸👌
Hi.
they took the ok sign out of modern warfare
I use all of these so I don&#39;t care lmao
Persona 5? Pls like so we can make it to the top!
omg gru is a white supremacist confirmed
Wow, people r literal idiots. Seriously, who is the idiot who was so desperate for attention that he made the ok symbol not ok? Like, give someone 5 years to get attention, and one idiot made ok bad. Thats as stupid as Adventure saying mrbeast is rude and horrible.
Seems this video got recommended to a lot of people again for some reason. It&#39;s weird seeing people attributing fake outrage to boomers nowadays (by that I mean this year) it used to be them attributing it to millennials
👌
well, time to ban minions ._.             they have a white master and that promotes white supremacy!! smh
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌

OK    IS      OK
It&#39;s bullshit why do leftist want to make everything and everyone who disagres with them seem racist, sexist or any form of prejudice if any thing they are making it worst
Since my mom is deaf i have to do 👌🏻 As Ok
Instead of using ur your hand like    \ |/               Just do    \\\        now it isn’t a w or p<br>                                                               O                                      O
Watched this in 2020... thought it was new.
W<br>   P
I have never seen the government act so childish before. This is crazy
This documentary of a video made me question the whole foundation of humanity
My dad:what is your wisdom<br>Me:my wisdom is beyond your understanding
I mean Pepe is alive again for me
PewDiePie u just maked the wp sign in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=547">9:07</a>. And wp stands for well played so when u game and a round is about too be finished. All players is writing wp..... Lol

Brofist should be The love symble
I dont want to be rude, but we can all agree that some people are really fucking dumb, and thepy will say or do anything to get some internet points or just get recognized.
What in white shirt is this!
TECHNOPEPE
I forgot this was a Pewdiepie video and was literally surprised when pewds came in and sat down
Is this just r/woooosh?
this means war to normies
Hahaha diamond sword go brrrrr
my friend thinks it is pronounced peep
The internet is scary because idiots have access to more idiots
Am i big pp
Gods, do I hate people sometimes. Some of y’all make it hard not too.
Uhhhhhhhhh am I safe?
I hate everyone so much about the whites power thing. It’s so retarded. But the circle game is cool tho. I don’t care, frick you. Imma still use it👌🏼👌🏼. Shut up.
When did Pewds become the voice of reason?
I remember when my friend told me the gotem sign was white power, I’m pretty sure I asked so many questions to my teacher, they thought I was going to join wp, lol
just 10 more seconds felix
Why nazis
I actually like clickbait now
Also This is where the riots begin
The guy in the white house is a trooper!!!
This is the secret reason on why he doesn’t do the brofist intro that much than he used to.
12
god people are so stupid
<b>pepe now</b><br>I rule this land!
ironically enough, the phrase&quot;subscribe to pewdiepie,&quot; is in itself becoming a bit of a so-called &quot;hate symbol&quot; phrase, with it being documented following the Mosque Massacre of New Zealand, the brutal Murder of Bianca Devins, and etc.
👌
Anyone offends everyone nowadays
Love this style of content
this is the first pewdiepie video i watched and enjoyed in a long time
People will do anything to make trump look like the bad guy
Boomers are back at it again 👌
Good video but clickbait :(
Feels sad man
Society
this is ridiculous! its like saying jojo poses are tik tok poses and araki just copied them,
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌ARR YOU MAD NOW???
twitter is THE prime example of a left cestpool
💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💓💓💓👍👍👍👍👍👍
Yo why does this sound like a trailer from a action movie
Bruh we got a emoji for this thing 👌 they really think this is a symbol for “white power”  no, just no, we ain’t doing that. That shit is for shits and giggles
A white nationalist with a Spanish name God bless
Soon living will also be a hate symbol
This is the magic of these things. A person who thinks pepe or the ok hand is racist or right wing, might as well be wearing a sign saying &quot;I believe whatever the media tells me&quot;&quot; <br><br>Go forth with this wisdom. Avoid the people that believe this bs because they cannot be reasoned with.
did they legit blur the OK sign, what a bunch of literal boomers
The problem is the media is extremely left or extremely right. Most of the media is extremely left. The extreme left is the group that makes everything racist. Even though most people working there are white.
The world: WP=WhIte pOwEr aNd tHis is a HAtE CriMe<br><br>Me a black guy: does it look like I give a diddly darn fuck? It’s a meme!!
hes talking like its the oldest anarchy srver on minecraft
12
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
its... just a meme<br>like they hate memes??
Actually a b and c werent hate symbols. It was the background and text font.
This is just dumb. These are memes, not racist signals.
👌=🤮🤮👴👴👴 PEWDIEPIE=😎😎🤑🤑

Bowl haircut I’m going all in!<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Shit</b>

Nice shirt.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=200">3:20</a> I started shouting stop when she started saying <br>&quot;BuT lOoK At ThE InTern He MakE StRaNgE Symbol Oooo bad BaD bAD No nO&quot;
I hate when this stuff happens.. It&#39;s just ridiculous like why should this happen..
UPSIDE DOWN HAND GESTURE!? BISH WHAT THE HELL HAVE U BEEN SMOKING?<br>IF I SMILED UPSIDE DOWN AM I FROWNING OR JUST SMILING UPSIDE DOWN? <br>SOME PEOPLE JUST WANNA FIND THE HATE IN THINGS, AND THOSE SAME PEOPLE WANNA WATCH THE WORLD BURN.
Why is everyone complaining about everything. I hate people.
Shows how hateful people are, why not make it world peace (wp) it still works , so why not
I got clickbaited by my master
how are people this stupid at least the ok hand isn&#39;t dead
Wait a minute pends ain’t internet historian
You cant do anything without media
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌

👌
So basically<br>Pepe and OK sign<br>Are cancelled
Why cant adults stop being boomers?
👌👌🙌👍
Me: <b>puts up a ok sign</b><br>The entire fucking USA: YOU HAVE COMMITED A HATE CRIME
Well this is kind of out of control people are getting tracked down for hand symbols 👌
Soon EVERYTHING is a hate symbol
MEME LORDS AND MEMERS!  ITS TIME FOR WAR PROTECT THE MEMES REVIVE THE DEAD AND FIGHT THE ANTI MEMES!!!
I was watching Happy Tree Friends<br><br><br>Then Petunia pulled a fast one on me
Okay so the morally wrong Marxist black power fist is okay but the brofist ain’t.
Me and everyone in my friend group use the ok hand as a signal of friendship            .
Peppa the frog
brofist is a hate symbol
I swear the boomers are just trying to say everything that everybody likes is a “hate crime”
Typical CNN
Not 10 minutes so no ads 👀
This video is a freaking meme documentary
In rhis video we see the government being boomers in their natural habitat
Ok hand sign<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>👌
ƒ
i&#39;m sorry a white supremacist did a thumbs-up? that&#39;s racist now.
Why is pinching offensive<br>(I know it&#39;s the ok sign not pinching but just look 🤏👌 you basically see no difference.)
Please make more videos like this one, i would appreciate it
Why was this recommended from 8 months ago lol like if ya see this
👌🔽
i’m pretty sure that the original ok hand is 9 in asl because that’s how you make it.
YOU CLICKBAITED US ALL
This ladies and gentlemen this is the start of Twitter kpop stans cancelling everything or everyone that did one bad thing years ago
This idea that the ok sign is a hate symbol is honestly so fucking stupid
ive lost faith in humanity
👌
better censor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=440">7:20</a> before wall street journal picks that up...
Amazibg that PewDiePie did better coverage and had a better take of this than most MSM outlets &amp; politicians.
pewdiepie is the one whos racist
Ok signs is white power symbol<br><br>Meanwhile trump: 👌
This didn&#39;t sound like a pewds video
The swastika came from Hindu India, and was taken in a bad way, by people who can&#39;t understand.
We are killing ourself
Felix is speaking more truthful words than my math teacher

“Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.” <br>― Sun Tzu, The Art of War
Isn’t this basically just some old people that can’t take jokes especially dark humor?
America not smart country🤔
👌
Man old people are stupid
Where is the bro fist on the thumbnail was this clickbait
soooo... how is the brofist a hate symbol again??
We must stand in front of👌🏻 and stop it
People ruin good things just because there stupid
this is clickbait, he didnt mention that the brofist was a hate symbol
Dutch from red dead redemption was right “when he’s gone, they’ll just find another monster”
Thats crazy
I love that the media believed a rumor from 4 Chan, the most racist social media.
bruh where&#39;s the &quot;brofist is no a hate symbol&quot; part
I mean good video and all but it was kinda clickbait
Funny cause I said all three of them 😂😂
when you become a hate symbol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=217">3:37</a> ikr
Now all we need are people getting mad at the DBS Broly movie for using the ok symbol.
0;18 the bolw cut
Literally try and sit like that girl and stuff it feel so nice honestly just resting your hand in that position feels amazing xD
👌
I never call people boomers because I hate saying that, but holy shit news reporters are <b>BOOMERS</b> (and they&#39;re retarded)
👌
The amount of stupids that took the bait from 4chan is ridiculous
👌=✅
pepe alive forever
I don’t think the ok hand will truly change meaning. It’s been around for years and years and I just feel like it’s far too widespread.<br>I mean I there’s an emoji of it 👌. There might be some media companies or Karen’s that freak out to spread fear and get clicks but society has used it for as long as I can remember and I don’t think some trolls on 4chan are going to single-handedly change that. (At least I hope so)
People are dying everywhere. Children are starving and retarded leftist are getting offended over a ok hand gesture.
👁👃👁<br>     👄
Wheres the tittle
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
The media can&#39;t have fun
They blurred the ok sign 🤦
Never thought the government would kill memes more than the Pewds himself
PepeHands
guys look, I&#39;m racist. 👌
👌 mb  :/
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Not gonna lie, he clickbaited us with the brofist hate symbol
There obviously on black tar heroine
For ever one that uses racism as a Way to get more clicks on your news channel here’s a big fat 👌 boomer
🖕this will be a peace sign
Damn i.hate the internet sometimes
now that i like
So, ummmm<br><br>If they ban the ok symbol then why don&#39;t they ban the middle finger, if they ban the middle finger then the should ban the black people saying the n word ( that was not to upset people because I dont know what to called them)
-_- ....👌🏿
is pewdiepie the new ben shapiro?
Pewdiepie:<br><br>Bro FIST is USED AS HATE?!<br><br><br>Video:<br><br><br>Bro fist, and peepa <br><br><br>Everyone:<br><br>Click bait

I like this new commentary format                                                        Incredible job!
what annoys me is that some of the people that were\ doing the &quot;wHiTe pOwEr&quot; sign clearly weren&#39;t even white lol
Flup your phone.            upside down<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Never gunna give you up never gunna let you down and desert you<br><br><br><br><br>Hahahahahahaha hahaahahhahahahahhah
Ah yes, <b>this</b> is humanity.<br>Soon enough, breathing will be considered offensive.
Man seeing you from being a little teen turning to a busy adult is just-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><i>w h o a</i></b>
As someone who does scuba diving, it is impossible to irradiate the ok sign. We use it ALL THE TIME. Also how amazing is this type of video? Just fantastic.
doctumentary people sometimes get u to click on the video making u think it happened but it is related to his or her death or his symbol but it&#39;s just like a totally diffrent topic of the title
Seriously<br><br><br><br>Not everyone knows about this. My old English teacher did this. <br>It’s even still an emoji 👌
I have a pop socket i its more confterpul to hold it in the ok sigh
i dont really like pepe
old people suck the fun out of it.
👌🏻
The white power ok sign is literally the sign for a all black fraternity
Yo good music choices!
the nazis swastik is faced to a different direction compared to the buddhism swastika. So that doesn&#39;t count
👌🏻 I can&#39;t believe there is an emoji for this..
Some person: make the OK hand gesture<br>That group of people that make big deal out of things: wHiTE sUpRemESy
I don’t 👌 you.
This is why news channels should not touch memes because they ruin it for everyone exept for Pepe i understand why it was being killed but it was funny while it was good
How about I do it and just pay no attention to anyone or anything related to it? I mean... you technically can&#39;t stop me. I&#39;m not going to spam it, but if I get caught in a video doing it and people mention it, I&#39;ll just ignore them.
Idea: Remove the media
Stop and think how many times this video got us<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>👌
It’s funny cause In sign language you use the 👌 as the letter f and number 7 i believe
My mom once grounded me foor doing the 👌 when i said ok ):
It&#39;s nothing but a bunch of boomers that don&#39;t know what the heck there talking about
The U.S news media is major cringe
My mom won’t let me use 👌 because she thinks it’s a white supremacy symbol
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
The things we love it become a negative thing its so very dumb
👌
👊👊🏻👊🏼👊🏾👊🏿
I hate when people take everything on 4Chan seriously.
You no why this is the worst year ever cause 1. Covid 2.the stupid people rioting against police, police are good things 3. And the a future reason that will probably come from the schools
And then peepo was born
I actually guessed all of them at the beginning of the video, thats fucking nuts
Why did I get chills watching this
The Internet needs a self destruct button
The news media should be really restricted in which they can say or not. Sounds bad but they are always causing trouble.
Are people this stupid <br><br>Because this is just stupid
Very sad times....
Bro nice jet set radio music
👌unlucky gg well played libtards👌
So yo do have legs? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QWUOAcg_Q&amp;t=361">6:01</a>
I know this is way too late to post this and that alot of ppl have said this but how is teh brofist a hate symbol?
I believe that there&#39;s a time when human existence is considered as a hate symbol
Me whos 12 : <i>confused screaming</i>
the upside down OK hand gesture actually stands for DW from pbs kids aurther
👉👌
👌 if that meant white power they would not have made an emoji
Aight we need to ban boomers from the game.
This makes me glad i dont watch the news, use twitter, reddit, facebook, 4chan, and everything in between<br>Edit: this is mostly due the the absolutely horrendous amount of storage on my phone
Welcome to EUA,a karen society that have stupid peoples,simps and boomers
The Video deserve this 👍<br><br>Oops it fell<br><br><br><br>👍<br><br><br><br><br>👍<br><br><br><br><br><br>👍<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>👍<br><br><br><br><br><br>👌Haha got’em
Oops.
The ok sign spells W and P then don&#39;t put apart your fingers squeeze them together.
Fans and pewdiepie see brofist<br><br>Filipinos sees presidents logo for respect<br>Like if you fellow Filipino agree.
Pepe ah the good days before tiktok
Boomers are dumb
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
ALL OF THEM????
The haircut.
