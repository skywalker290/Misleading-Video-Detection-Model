Every time we watch the trailer and we wanna know his name again
Endgame was Marvel&#39;s peak. Thats it
Back when Marvel was at its peak. Back when I used to fanboy over the pure awesomeness of this trailer. Oh, the glory days.
The hype was so real fml 🔥

In 2024?
Now the next wait is for Avengers Secret Wars &amp; Avengers 5❤
Mcu will never live up to this
As much as I hate to say this but the Multiverse saga needs to hurry up and end already so that we can get that grounded level of the MCU we all love with a splash of cosmic movies here and there. I&#39;m just saying 🤙
“ the end is near” yep the old Mcu is gone
I really wanna go back to 2018 rn
when marvel was good
2024 and still this masterpiece trailer gives absolute chills🥶
Do
When i watched this trailer for the first time, i though captain america will unlock some new powers and that&#39;s how he will able to stop thanos&#39;s hand
Spider man and the avengers was the best out of the other surprises
Best trailer till date 18 feb 2024. ❤
Septrional
Who here from 2024
Gonna tell my grandkids this was the star wars of our time
Best mcu movie ever made
the Russo&#39;s are geniuses.
Probably the best comic book trailer and movie ever made.
Can&#39;t wait for this to come out !
Definition of perfect trailer
here to remind myself what mcu was at it&#39;s peak
Interesting looking back at this, there is footage that clearly was altered for the trailer cause Thanos is only wielding 2 stones when fighting Cap.
I watch this trailer every once in a while to shed a tear remembering the hype that the MCU used to bring us. It’s dull now. Never forget the infinity saga. It was truly epic. It was the Star Wars of our generation.
Who is watching this in 2024
PEAK MCU
Watched this movie 9 times till now <br>Feel sad for IRON MAN 😭
anybody here
Alguien en 2024
Take me back to when the mcu was at its peak
I wasn&#39;t a Marvel fan at this point... and I remember going to see Greatest Showman and seeing this trailer and thinking it looked AMAZING... but I never went to see it. In fact, I didn&#39;t get into the MCU until Spider-Man Far From Home so I missed the hype but I&#39;d already experience major movie hype during my Harry Pottr phase.
When I&#39;m done half<br>Of humanity will still <br>EXIST.. Perfectly<br>balance as all things <br>      should be.<br><b>******************</b><br> I hope they<br>REMEMBER YOU!
Still the best trailer I’ve ever seen
Sometimes I come back to this trailer and I get a tear to my eye cuz we used to have it all guys….we use to have it all
This trailer is now part of legend
One of the best trailers of all time.
People watching this after watching tom hollands leaking video

U should have said killing bad people it is more than 60 percent, not half of humanity
it was perfect,perfect, everything down to the last minute details
Anyone here after 5 years🫶🫶
Esse trailer continua lindo ❤
Yup I’m doing a infinity saga marathon now lfg
you have to be there
Do you guys realize that theres only two infinity stones when cap was straining back
I remember people were guessing who would die bc of this trailer, Iron Man or Captain America. Turns out, half of the universe died. LMAO
You just had to be there
Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it&#39;s every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.<br><br>Rating: 9.6. Final Verdict: EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER.
Please marvel come back
Still live this
avengers studios
I love this movie
future generations will never understand the hype for Infinity War and Endgame.......
They will never replicate the hype and badassery of the Infinity War and Endgame trailer and the films.  All those years led up to this moment. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. Too bad the MCU is starting its downfall.
Make movie with Galactus or some villain like Thanos we need it!!!!
This trailer is more exciting years later than the entirety of Phases 4 and 5.
I used to watch this trailer about 10 times a day ...😍😍
It&#39;s now the last days of 2023 (December). Looking back I yern for the past. How the film-craft has perished. Infinity War was one of my top 10 cinematic experiences, up there with Raiders, Back to the Future, Aliens, ET, The Matrix, T2, A.I...and now all we&#39;re left with is studio heads forcing a set of political agendas via this once great platform/IP that eclipses quality character development &amp; narration, let alone solid engaging cinematic cues. A colossal shame. It&#39;s a cinematic crime. Effectively every film post Endgame has gone to the dogs. I know some are going to say Spidy 3 but that was more a re-hash of several than an Infinity experience. Good but no cigar.
Tell me his name again?<br><br><br>Kratos 😂😅😊
Still watch , 2024 !
This is what i expect from Marvel movies, recently they are producing crap for us.
December 2023 still watching this iconic trailer
Jesus loves you!
Jesus ama vocês!
It&#39;s 2023. Sometimes I still come back and re-watch these trailers, to remind myself of how unbelievably exciting this time in the MCU was. I hope I get to feel this again in my lifetime.
What a confidence.. Revealing whole movie plot in few first seconds

Infinity war and endgame have no repeat value in isolation.
This movie is a legit cinematic masterpiece

Just came back to watch this masterpiece… man I wish they made marvel like they used to
Back when Marvel was worth watching.
Watched this trailer 5x a day everyday untill the movie came out, had day 1 tickets, there was nuthin more hype than this
Tell me his name again! - Your death!

The penultimate finale. Brilliant! Love how it built up to Endgame. Second fav after Endgame
Why is youtube recommending me this after 5 years
That <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=88">1:28</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=90">1:30</a> is music to my ears until now
thanos setup is good but this time kang i think mcu did very hurry to setup without giving us a good story movie
Say what you want about this movie. Good or bad. But the hype was historical. There will never be a movie that made this much hype in cinematic history
Let’s Hope Marvel Doesn’t Switch Up The Kang Dynasty Or Storyline. Let’s at least Wrap Up the multiverse saga to the rumored “reboot” of the MCU if things aren’t going well. HWR was a great way to tease not just him, but all of him on the way to wreak havoc on the multiverse. Loki was a catalyst, as now, the timelines, while now growing peacefully, are now susceptible to hostile takeover by the Kang Variants, which I WANT to see. Let’s hope they’re bold enough to double down on the kang story to the end

Its 2023 and this trailer is enough to beat all the movies they released in the last 3 years. Peak MARVEL was something else..🥺
best MCU movie.
This is the best Marvel movie ever and everything since has been dogshit
5 yıl sonra tekrar izlediğimde bana büyük heyecan veriyor.
This trailer gives great excitement.
Mehn still watching the trailer
I just heard Wong in this movie talk about the beginning of the universe 😂 he said at the beginning there was nothing.....and then it blew up.     Yeah...what blew up if there was nothing?     Infinity stones won&#39;t be coming with a bunch of powers from nothing, i&#39;ll tell you that.    The universe could not begin on its own, especially if there was nothing.    If there was nobody and nothing,  then there&#39;d still be nobody and nothing,  because nothing would&#39;ve been there to start something moving in the first place
The coldest marvel trailer
Goosebumps overloaded! Missing those days!
Wish we had this marvel now in 2023
Iron man switching to mega thrusters smoothly was one of the hype things we never know would exist
Omg this trailer was goosebumps 💥😇❤️
Best movie of marvel
Still give me Goosebump 🔥
The movie that got me hooked with the whole MCU. addicted and sold completely    ahhhhhh! CINEMA
Watching it from 2023 and its still the best trailer ever made
GOOSEBUMPS🔥🔥🔥
WOW!! Still gives me Goosebumps🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The intro of each character in this trailer is still powerful.
Good! ☆☆☆☆☆
<b>R.I.P. TONY</b> 🫡<br><b>May 29, 1970 - Oct 17, 2023</b><br><b>I love you 3000</b>
They will never repeat the hype
Is there a version of the theme like what kicks in at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=63">1:03</a>?
the infinity saga should be studied
Sahal, Haroon,jay and shijin❤
In one movie, Thanos becomes a culture icon and forever be a villain of the generation.
I WANT THIS MCU BACK SO BAD😭😭😭
Infinite war mai baki Villon ka han sale gaye
Thanks to all of you iron man you did give the mockers a chance hats off to your swag❤
Iron man dad looks  like  the  loki friend
In this trailer,when Thor found strombekar he used that time😊😊
I get this goosebumps every time
This makes me only more excited for when the trailers for Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars drop
Mcu
Nostalgia 😢
Watched this trailer more than 100 times, infinity war had the best trailers of all time. Can&#39;t forget the hype that era of infinity war and endgame was peak marvel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=94">1:34</a>
The music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=10">0:10</a> gets me pumped every time 😳
this movie changed my life with how amazing it is. if i were to watch one movie for the rest of my life, i wouldn&#39;t watch infinity war all over the gain. just saying that it&#39;s great.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=91">1:31</a> chills
Boy, I still get amped seeing Captain America hold back Thanos with all his might.
Thor carried all infinity war.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😊
This and endgame are the peak and history of the marvel what an era miss old marvel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=106">1:46</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=110">1:50</a> seeing Cap putting up that fight always gives me chills.
And I&#39;m still here in 2023
I miss this time in marvel
Tell me his name again 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
I never commented on this trailer but I&#39;m commenting now as a sort of time capsule. I bet in a couple years I&#39;m gonna look back on this comment. Hi future me, hope you&#39;re doing well. By now I bet Avengers 5 &amp; 6 are out, or are currently being shown, and you&#39;re looking back at the ol&#39; infinity war days, hope everything&#39;s good. Written on September 9th, 2023.
Nothing will ever touch infinity war  and endgame, best movies ever!
am still watching this trailer like the movie gonna release next week
🇺🇸Scarlett🇺🇸Johansson🇺🇸33🇺🇸
I want hulk to sit on me with his gyat
Infinity stone is 23
5 years ago... So nostalgic
This movie is better than all dc movies
Who else is watching this trailer in 2023 (I’m still watching it because in my opinion this is one of the best trailers of all time)
🥶🥶
O Thanos Einai sthn eleutheriou benizelou 46 glyfada
Auto generated subtitles said santos instead of thanos😂
😈👿🔥👁️
that small segment of cap holding the gauntlet in place, with both he and thanos struggling so hard did and still does give me goosebumps to this day
Eliminating half the universe life is disappointingly pointless as a goal. What does it accomplish? Life duplicates fast.
Robert you are a good man!!!
2023 and it’s still one of the best Marvel movies, (prob an unpopular opinion) not even Across the Spider-Verse can beat seeing this for the first time
Et là je me dis qu&#39;en voyant War Machine c&#39;était un Skrull 😂😂
Is Gamora in the movie ? The one with the antenas
This and End game were the last GREAT pieces out of Marvel studios. It’ll never be like this again.
By the infamous mode🎉😂
i just wish peter and dr strange had that encounter in the movie
1 Aug 2023 for memorial...
Who is watching this trailer in 2023
Top
This is one of my favorite MCU trailers. The hype and anticipation for this film was everything. Watching this opening night was 🔥🔥🔥. This trailer will never get old and will always get me hyped. <br><br>My other favorite MCU trailer...Black Panther. Oh, to see Chadwick Boseman embody such an amazing character was everything. Watching Black Panther opening weekend was pure joy and excitement. I watch that trailer now, and tears begin to well up.
Nowadays with all the violence and shootings and division and negative stereotypes/racism that most people are doing too each other more than ever-Hmmm the Infinite stones and a snap 🫰 of the fingers to restart the universe and destroy the old universe with most if not all the wicked things it brought up-doesn’t seem like a bad idea😮 like THANOS states-“Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be!”
Who is out here in 2023 hoping to get movie like this again from Marvel
;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=101">1:41</a>
⌛️10/10⌛️ next gene
This sounds weird but I wish there was more of like “balance” in the movie considering it is all about balance. Just a Thought
Coming back to watch this in 2023, kinda made me mad how they made it look like Tony and Gamora were gonna talk, they never even met which bugs me. Even in endgame when Tony was with nebula, I woulda thought he would do soemthing to her body so she has built in iron man weaponry in her
right this is epic my mind is blown
When the trailer&#39;s actually made us believe Tony talked to gamora.
BEST. MARVEL MOVIE. EVER.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=96">1:36</a>  Elizabeth Olsen ❤
I am not here to wipe out the half population og universe . Everything is finished og you Are having the event live . Loki is giving away the reality stone . Loki this time give him a soap ( saabon)that the svine remove its germ. He is not a god dont be scared . It is me Taher Shah which is light nor og east neither of west which is Mohammad Taher Momand on red Norwegian pass .
Its been 5 years since thanos Slap the half of the universe
This and Endgame were such peak Cinema. Can’t believe this movie is 5 years old already
This trailer still brings me to peak love with the MCUs prime. So much I can forget the disasters of phase 4
the hype for this movie was unreal. Still remember waiting for the trailer, reading all those theories... uh those dayss🤩.
5 years since marvel&#39;s peak
Soon you will all be seeing hulk dancing and singing, that&#39;s what happens when Disney has taken over
One of the greatest movies of all time<br>,,The end is near&quot;
Funfact : Though thanos wiped out half of the universe , infinity war managed to earn 2.1 billion dollar . Just imagine what would have happened if the whole universe would have witnessed this masterpiece in the theatre 😮
Who here after knowing Avengers: Kang Dynasty, Avengers: Secret Wars part 1, and Avengers: Secret Wars part 2❤❤❤is COMING
I like how no one talks about how the Peter and Doctor strange conversation got changed but this one’s just felt more natural and I want it back
The best year
😎 I asked this question where were you when the avengers Infinity war and endgame came out
The movies what came out the same year...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=26">0:26</a> with auto subtitle &quot;tell me his name again Santos&quot; 🤣🤣
5 years later and this trailer gave me goosebumps
I came here from a Christopher Robin meme
Somebody in 2023?
Spiderman❤
2023🗿🗿🗿🗿
I wish we could go back 😞
The best eva than endgame
This is one of the lifetime movie, I hope future generations will get to experience something like that.. the decade-long build-up, the hype, the delivery....
I really really REALLY hope that when secret wars comes out, its atleast half as epic as infinity wars and end game
I wanna watch it again 😁
What a trailor and what a movie it is
This is a &quot;real marvel&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=55">0:55</a>  to  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=62">1:02</a>🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanos really was right: &quot;The end is near...&quot;<br><br>Everything feel apart without goodwriting and mainly politics...<br>The rest came by consequence of that.<br><br>I hope some day, those glory days could back. I miss the inspiration; someone to look up too.
Still one of my favourite trailers
Good 👍 😢
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=106">1:46</a> have you seen thanos glove?, he only has 2 stones , thats because it would be spoilers...
i think wakanda battle is better than endame final battle
&quot;When I&#39;m done, half of humanity will still exist.&quot; Those lines just give me chills.
It&#39;s been 5 years but as a DC fun ,I can say that this movie will go down as the best ever superhero movie
Already 5 years ago
This movie is an actual marvel in the history of cinema
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=11">0:11</a> what are they looking at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=56">0:56</a>
wow, 5 years already
they will never be able to make anything like this again
watching this and then end game for the 6th time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=106">1:46</a> In this scene in movie, thanos has 5 infinity stones but here he has only 2 of them.
Why there is only 2 stone in gauntlet when captain is holding it 👀 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=105">1:45</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=106">1:46</a>
Fun Fact: In the trailer Thanos got 2 stones in the Captain and Thanos scene while in the movie there were four stones in the same scene
Tom smiling like a kid😅
The baddest trailer ever
World surprise trail😮😮
I MISSS GOLDEN AGE OF MCU🥹🥺
&quot;Tell me his name again.&quot;<br>&quot;...Thanos.&quot;<br><b>record scratch</b><br><br>Still the greatest intro to a movie trailer *ever*, perhaps THE best trailer ever.
The hype for Avengers Infinity War was incredible, I remember getting excited each time a new trailer came out, watching the movie opening weekend was an  unforgettable experience , good times 👏👏👏👏
how, how did we go from peak superhero films, to the absolute dumpster fires we have now save for  few exceptions
Why thanos has no infinty stone when he jump to captain america
Imagine going from this to phase 4
It’s been 5 years since THE BLIP. And it seems MCU should just go back in time to the same once again, and learn from their own marvelous movies to make something better this time.
This was the best, Hype for Thanos was at another level.
&quot;I&#39;m peter btw&quot;<br>&quot;Doctor Strange&quot;<br>&quot;Oh you&#39;re using made up names then I am Spiderman&quot;<br><br>And now all people forgot Peter Parker and only know Spider-Man
Tbh... If any of Avengers had been in his supreme version..Thanos would have died by then.
I do not care how old this trailer gets, it will always be the MOST epic trailer in existence for so many reasons. ❤
i actually can’t believe it’s been 5 years
I thought cap was gonna die, and it would have been such an amazing way to go. He knowingly facing certain death but still soldiers on... chills.<br><br>But then we got End Game, what a terrible movie.
The movie turns 5 today<br>Absolutely my #1 movie of 2018! <br><br>Thanos doesn’t see himself as a bad guy, he feels he’s doing the universe a favor being merciful <br>His idea  seems more Malthusian, there’s probably better ways to save a species but in his eyes Thanos sees it as a simple calculus<br>This universe is finite as are its resources, if life goes unchecked life will cease to exist therefore it needs correcting, how many are the only ones with the will to act on such a thing even murdering trillions, the hardest choices require the strongest wills, an act of creation is an act of destruction, failure isn’t the end it’s what breeds new development <br>The issues he brings up reflects our current ones like population control next to over using natural resources<br>Plenty of biblical themes about rebirth (water being equated with feminism and baptism)<br>The movie truly has everything for fans that have been keeping up with these films since 2008 from the comedy to the callbacks to many inside references to the comics <br>The action is some of the best in my opinion since it goes so much bigger and switches from battling on earth to outer space<br>It’s crazy how the filmmakers are handling 20 characters since it is a big task but thankfully none of the scenes drag or feel like their smushed together because all of them are interwoven <br>The score by Alan Silverstri is some of his best balancing the fight scenes, the epic ness, and the emotional moments <br>Gamora is the heart of this story for the first half since she’s the adopted daughter of the Mad Titan and holds the key to tracking down the rest of the stones<br>Josh Brolin is perfect playing this villain not to mention the superb computer graphics with every detail of his facial expressions, his eyes, his skin pores and he makes a believable intimidating presence <br>You also see his perspective at a certain point why he’s doing all of this and he’s the best villain put on film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe <br>By the time it ends I was absolutely in tears<br>We’ve grown so much with these characters over several movies and want them to come out on top it truly makes you wonder what’s in store for Part 2<br>Joe and Anthony Russo have made the ‘Lord of the Rings’ of comic book movies and I’m very impressed!!!
if you come back to this trailer just to go back to that feeling you had the first time you saw it, you are a legend!
Awesome movie!
It has been 5 years already? Half a decade? Wtf?
coming here 5 years later,  still goosebumps
I forgot this always 5 yrs ago
Kang will never be half the villain Thanos was
but during that part he only has 2
in the movie thanos has 5 stones
The sence where captin america is trying to avoid the hand from thanos
THIS MOVIE HAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE!
remember when everyone thought cap had the stone in him because his eyes
I wish i had a time travel to travel back in time to experience this masterpiece for the first time
Happy 5 Year Anniversary to Avengers: Infinity War! 🥳

Leagend watching in 2023 returning after Tony&#39;s bleep😂😂who died due to Thanos 🫰 snap🤣
The tapestry of films that led to infinity war and endgame is by far the best films that were ever made, particularly these last 2!
Still the best MCU movie

Your also supposed to turn in you murder cams, and the enemies dead bodies.

Here again in 2023 <br>watching this masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
While I’m excited for Secret Wars, nothing will ever top this
Pluto is our moon.
That would be About Time Travel. The Death Star was created smaller to restructure the Planet which is actually Pluto.
Looking scene from Avengers is when gundam war during Space War WW1 occurred, the moon exploded, recently &quot;McAllen, Texas&quot; exploded. Jiren vs Goku, and Vegeta... Rudy betrays us which is what people don&#39;t know... that is when the moon exploded. Currently it is WW2. You are only able to hire SuperHeros or God&#39;s, or Angels, or Heros through Time so you are able to fortify our Military. It is actually a Space War Theory. I studied similar to General Z his Diploma.

5 years ago. The world witnessed the fight that left the world trembling.
Amazing looking back at it now, and seeing the little things.  Thor conjuring the bifrost, but without showing Stormbreaker.  Cap pushing up Thanos&#39;s hand with only 2 stones in the gauntlet (at that point he had everything but the Mind)....but such a great trailer!
This is still the single greatest movie trailer ever.
I can’t believe it’s been 5 years since the release of the movie. Seriously it was amazing
The transition towards the end!! Omg gooooooseeebumpsssss🎉⚡⚡⚡
Peak mcu 🙂still getting goosebumps
5 YEARS. 5 YEARS and this trailer still hits HARD. CORE.<br>We&#39;ve reached the year where Endgame takes place after this movie.<br>I still got CHILLS from this trailer wondering what&#39;s going to happen... then I remember.
Who&#39;s here in 2023 ??
Will come back in 2025 to see if this trailer is topped by kang Dynasty trailer or not
PEOPLE WHO DIDN&#39;T GOT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATERS DON&#39;T BE SAD BECAUSE AVENGERS KANG DYNASTY AND SECRET WOULD BE JUST SO LIT🔥🔥🔥🔥. IT WOUL BE A TIME OF NEW MARVE ERA😎😎😎😎
5 year later <br><br><br>We’re at the endgame now
What a legendary trailer
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 5 years since this trailer came out
5 years ago since this trailer
5 years ago this masterpiece of a trailer released!
5 years :(
Goated
Plz marvel do something I wanna experience this masterpiece one more time like first time.
I’ve never been to the cinema twice in one weekend but I had too for this movie
Nothing will ever top this movie ever
Привет с 2023 года, пересматриваю и всё ещё сердце щемит, охх и было же время эпичное когда весь мир ждал этот фильм 🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
Avengers Infinity War Official Trailer Black Panther Hulk Wanda Guardian of the Galaxy Thor X-Men future past
I need the team back
❤❤
It&#39;s been 5 years... Still the Greatest trailer ever made 🔥
This movie is 5 years old and still gives me goosebumps
THIS WAS CINEMA AND THE MCU until phase 4 ruined it.
Anyone notice at the @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=100">1:40</a> mark if your headphones loud enough you’ll hear a boy you better something 🤷🏾‍♂️ when hulk buster being attacked
Infinity War, Endgame and No Way Home are peak MCU, just makes me that much more sad seeing the way MCU is today
The year 2023 and this is easily still the greatest war trailer of all time
Can&#39;t beleive that it&#39;s been half a decade already since this masterpiece dropped.
Just happy to be a teen when the MCU was in its prime. It&#39;s amazing to look back on this
Rip an respect bosman sir love u miss u
top tier story, top tier acting, top tier music, top tier cgi, and look at it all now. take me back
It’s 2023 and hear to say the part when iron was chasing the spaceship was epic
I was a senior in high school when this movie came out. One morning, just before class started, my teacher said before we begin our lesson he would be playing this trailer because it dropped that morning. Such a great way to start a morning at school.
I was disappointed we never got to see Gamora and Tony talk to each other. This trailer made me excited for it. It was a clever edit though. But still, think about it. Gamora is the adopted daughter of Thanos and Thanos&#39; chaos had been stuck in Tony&#39;s head for 6 years at this point. Tony would be full of mixed emotions when meeting the daughter of his greatest enemy. But of course, he did spend almost a month drifted in space with Nebula.
THE BEST TRAILER EVER MADE!!!
Best trailer ever
Thanos es tan increíble como el mismísimo elon musk. XD.
Stan Lee tricks idiots by writing comic book jokes😂😂 then makes them into terrible movies I mean Stan Lee is great for that..
Man seeing this and endgame on theater with my best friends was awesome i wish i could experience it one more time
Take me to 2018 again 😢
I still watching trailer 🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘
I hope with my full heart and soul that Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars live up to this.
This trailer is inspiring
Infinity War was such a time to be a Marvel fan that movie is still hella cold to me and still the best MCU movie to date
That doctor strange micro surgery scene still gives me chill
I rmeber the hype when marvel used to be good
Thanos is a Communist. His plan assumes that gluttony will never become prevalent again, and that this “cleansing” will never need to be done ever again.
anyone watching my favourite one in 2023!
Man these were the good ol days…
I don&#39;t even know why but this Infinity War Avengers trailer still gets me hyped for the movie even though it was released 4 years ago.
Looking back this is so great like i didnteven imagine when i sww this movie and wasnt suprise
&quot;Evacuate the city, engage all defenses and GET THIS MAN A SHIELD!&quot;
Last scene - captain America full pack ❤️
Watching in 2023!! 😁
What Batman V Superman could’ve been. Not the extended cut the theatrical cut.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=70">1:10</a> that cape scene gives me chills everytime
4 years still got goosebumps 🤯
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=96">1:36</a> I screamed because i saw Wanda Maximoff, goosebumps!
maaaaaan the hype for this was so crazy back then
I am watching this in 2023 and remembering the time when MCU was at its peak &amp; now I just got thru 2022 when MCU was at it&#39;s worst
9 year old me before watching this didnt know anything about infinity stones my brother taught me bout it and hear I am 5 years later.
nostalgia vibes
Peak life
I still watching😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
The hype was something else,
love the kays cooking shoutout. she may not make the best food but she’s so purest
Film nya bagus banget
2023 and still here to get goosebumps ⚡
The Infinitiy Saga is probably the best saga we had for all of the MCU
I believe Kang dynasty will never be big as Infinity War in my opinion even though we&#39;re a few years out
5 years
5 years still gives me goosebumps
2023! Anyone?
ok diana spencer was very very very very very mad about some human speices
2023 I&#39;m still here
The way it was said was too wrong and funny but I get what he was trying to say.
“We have he wants so that’s what we is “.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣
fizeram historia e depois entregaram a ciranda que foi endgame
9th of January 2023, just came back to check this masterpiece.
My favorite avengers movie
Goosebump whenever I watch this........
They don’t make movies like this anymore
It&#39;s 2023 I can still feel the hype. That feeling is once in a lifetime
Infinity war &gt; Endgame
Infinity War was the best theater experience of my life. Shame that the MCU has become terrible and overtired.
i wish i could go back to march 16th 2018
neel to ron man
One of the best movies ever!
&quot;We live In a society, Where honor Is a distant memory, Isn&#39;t that right, 2023?&quot;
Es bellisimo
Idk why,<br>But I still get goosebumps watching this trailer
The HYPE for this movie was the biggest I ever felt!
MCU is finished after Endgame 😭🤧
Some people stop watching trailers after the movie.<br>But not us.
Fantastic movie ❤
I just watched  end game for the last time for a good while it was a great journey thanks marvel
Aliens only visit the United States and not other parts of the country.
Thor is best 😌
Future generations will not know the hype
I remember when I first watched this. I saw this opening day. Cant believe that it’s been almost half of a decade
I really hope Secret Wars everyone gets back together again and even more!
Already 4 years passed but still gives me same feeling and goosebumps ❤️
the first trailer for this was better
The best movie of all time ❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️
The greatest imagination cor.
f” u,4 dollar order.
Seeing the Avengers roster for this movie really just added more value to the hype,never forgetting this experience.
THIS was the MCU at its peak. The theories, the first time cross overs, thinking Cap was gonna die, seeing the GOTG mix with the Avengers and the pure might of Thanos. Nothing will top it. Star Wars of this generation.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=102">1:42</a>
Very grateful to lived long enough to experience the hype for this movie waiting for two plus hours online for tickets
2023 still watching trailer got both on 📀
I hope they remember you
Why youtube recommend now?
G. O. A. T
How has it already been almost 5 years since this movie came out!?!
Experience of a lifetime. I hope next 2 avengers movies be also good
When I first saw cap’s last scene in this trailer - I legit got the biggest chills ever. This trailer was something else.
If you think No Way Home&#39;s hype surpassed Endgame and Infinity War, you simply weren&#39;t there for this hype
B
2018- Infinity War <br>2019- Endgame <br>2021- No Way Home.<br>2023- Crimes Of Kingpin.<br>2024- New World Order. <br>2025- The Kang Dynasty. <br>2026- Secret Wars Part 1. <br>2027- Secret Wars Part 2. <br>24 films that blew the audience away in the theatres. Three of the best marvel movies.
still best trailer in 2023
Best superhero movie of all time!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=88">1:28</a>  🔥
If they didn&#39;t nerf the Hulk this would have been a perfect movie :( that was my only issue.
Life was simply good when we were still waiting for this movie and Endgame
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=73">1:13</a> they show thor getting his axe, with his eye still missing, in his cape powering up. Even though I loved his entrance this too would have been an awesome scene
When captain stops thanos&#39;s hand we can olny see power and space stone while thonos had collected 5 stones at that time
Perfectly balance
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=28">0:28</a>
from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=84">1:24</a> on you’re made aware the s* is real and the hype goes through the roof. so whoever edited those scenes so perfectly deserves a promotion and an oscar, at least. and I hope we get something like that for Kang and Secret Wars’ trailers. this is art.
Cap holding back Thanos in this trailer was just peak hype for me. The slow unveiling of Thanos over the 3 phases was executed so perfectly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=105">1:45</a>
“I hope they remember you”<br><br>Coldest line in marvel history
This is the prime of MCU
This is peak MCU and you can&#39;t tell me otherwise
Best MCU movie ever
What if ultron killed thanos in infinity war
In the movie he said, “I’m Spider-Man then” with a different delivery
Why am I hyping this movie in 2023?
This preview and movie lived up to the hype !!!!!
The huge battle being set in Wakanda was really awesome and I wonder how the Black Panther sequel will be like with that. R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER!!!
I dont think the future generations will understand the depth of the hype and excitement we felt waiting for this masterpiece Almost 4 years later, still the best superhero film ever made.
Greatest movie marvel has made to this day
I&#39;m eion by the way doctor strange oh your using your made up names then I am Spiderman
I&#39;m eion Spiderman
remember when marvel movies used to be good? nostalgia
Please, erase the movie from my memory, so that I can see it again as &quot;first time&quot; 🤍
Watching the end of infinity war in cinema was chilling
🥺
this was peak we didnt know what we had
Still come here sometimes guys? to remember the hype that we will never see again apparently
Who&#39;s watching this after the announcement of secret wars
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=104">1:44</a> I can&#39;t fully recall this moment, since I haven&#39;t rewatched the film in some time, but was this scene of Thanos leaping ever used?
This movie was much darker then a typical mcu movie I love it.
Even though this movie is old still I watch this trailer. It gives me more vibe than any other trailers
Avengers infinity war &gt; Avengers Endgame
Still the best marvel trailer of all time imo.
Rest in power, William Hurt, Chadwick Boseman, &amp; Stan Lee who&#39;s did the cameo in that movie 5 years ago.
Clever editing removing stormbreaker
Peak
Sometimes I like to come back here and remember what Marvel used to be... 🥲
Who’s here in 2022?
This movie was Perfect but most of the stuff in the trailer was never actually in the movie
amazing i nostalgia with this film, where i always think this moment
The best Avengers movie. Hands down.
Gambora - Thanos<br>Subtitles - Santos 💀😂
You know a trailer is good when it can still get you hyped for your second least favorite favorite Avengers movie
Looking back on these trailers, the Russo Brothers did not miss a bear
still getting those goosebumps
Was Avengers: Endgame Was Supposed To Be Avengers: Infinity War Part 2 Earlier In Production Stages?
This trailer always hypes me even after 4 years
Who&#39;s here in 2022? This trailer is legendary! The hype for this movie was unreal.
Yep in 2022  also its best superhero movie trailer
Infinity War &gt; Endgame
I was at the begining of my university when this trailer came out. Even though I watched all the movies afterwards, I started watching all the Marvel movies again, from the first to the last movie. It was one of the best period of my life..
This movie can beat all adventure movies even with it’s trailer. Absolute wonder
Easily My Favorite MCU Movie
Watching it in October, 2022, still giving Goosebumps
To this day i still get goosebumps watching this trailer. <br><br>Truely EPIC 🔥
Excelente me encanta.
Came back here again to enjoy this trailer after 4years still i get those goosebumps 💥
The silent guardian, the soldier and our king is gone! seems like we lost a part of ourselves!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=72">1:12</a> this scene is deleted
Best film In Avengers saga<br>😍:I❤️Thanos because Perfectly balanced in 2020😂
After this woke culture came......
Anas syed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=104">1:44</a> épico, piel de gallina.<br>lo banco al cap
The bar was set to high, this is Best Super Hero movie ever made.   It may stay that way forever.
avengers 5 2025 avengers 6 2025

Saudades desse tempo... onde era liberado um trailer e geral ficava na maior expectativa para o filme
Its 2022, asto still get goosebumps
i have to watch trailers marathon to get back to the past and get hyped with ppl in the theater!!!!!<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw"></a>
so from this ...to phase four
One of the things I loved infinity war more than endgame was how civil war affected the outcome for this movie the way they were defeated by thanos really hit the spot that’s what makes me love infinity war a little more than endgame
I still miss Iron Man 😐
Never to be forgotten
Saudades da época que o povo falava que o Tony era a jóia da alma 😂😂😂😂🤭❤️
I love how Spidey got a special clip at the end💯💯
1.11 i didn&#39;t see in the movie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=108">1:48</a>
One of the best trailers from Marvel can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 4 years...🥺🥺
This trailer alone shits on the Snydervers
After she hulk : Thanos was right
I&#39;m watching this trailer 4 years and I&#39;m still having goosebumps<br>What a movie 😘😘
Best mcu movie all time
&quot;Tell me he&#39;s name again&quot;<br>&quot;Thanos&quot;<br><br>The subtitle: &quot;Santos&quot;
End Game was good but Infinity War was something else.
Can&#39;t wait for Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars ❤️
One of MCU best trailer if not the best !! still !!
This movie is surely gonna be one of the highest grossing movie of all time. Believe me 😉
MCU ended here for me.
An entire universe once 4 all 4.27.18 in 3D IMAX and dolby cinema
&quot;When I&#39;m done with the snap, the universe will be balanced.&quot;<br><b>Cap catches Thanos&#39; middle finger and pinky</b><br><b>Breaks fingers</b><br>&quot;Aight - i&#39;ma head out.&quot;<br><br>ROLL CREDITS
105.359.814views
4 years now, watched the movie so many times and still getting goosebumps watching this trailer.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=108">1:48</a>
Hot take: this was the greatest movie trailer of all time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=97">1:37</a>  DR strange: AaAaaaAaAaAAAAAA
rn I don&#39;t see Kang Dynasty and Secret wars living up to the hype That Infinity War and Endgame did with Phase 4 being pretty Mid besides Wandavision, Loki, and No way Home, but it is still 3 years away and Wakanda Forever Will most likely be a good movie. I don&#39;t see how it will flop. It&#39;s going to be a super Emotional movie
I own the Blu-ray and I have a subscription to Disney+ and yet I still get excited watching this trailer!
AMAZING
Who’s here after the she hulk twerk:(
We have to prepare for Kang&#39;s danger because he will be more dangerous than Thanos
Y’all noticed how they made Peter sound more confident at the scene at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=122">2:02</a> and in the movie he sounded more unsure if he was Spider-Man? 😂
2 years ago today our beloved king passed away. You are a real superhero Chadwick &amp; we all can’t wait to watch your legacy continue in the next black Panther movie! Wakanda Forever! 🙅🏿‍♂️🙅🏿‍♂️
No movie will ever create hype like this one did back then... Lifetime experience for us. ❤️❤️
Who’s here in 2022?🔥🔥
Iam in tears 😭😭😭😭😭 time flies
Infinity war shows us the best version of Thor, Strange and Especially Iron Man still missing his presence in future mcu movies. If I would be the ceo of mcu then I will definitly get him back thru any way on Avenger 4!
Man 2018 was a good year for me
I like the shot of Thor at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=70">1:10</a> very powerful shot of him.
Til this day I’m still mad that they didn’t use the scene from the thumbnail
This trailer still gives me goosebumps 🔥🔥❤️
Went through my liked video list. This was the very first vid I liked and it felt so long ago. The hype was worth it for the fans.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=88">1:28</a>
best mcu movie
Why did Thanos daughter die all you people in the movie business àre wicked and  miserable never like happy ending
Man, the hype for both Infinity War &amp; Endgame was such a gem to experience. I wish it was like this with the newer marvel shows &amp; movies
I miss how much I was hyped for this movie
im from 2023
Brings back the memories of 2019, I wish I could go back.
This Is My First Ever Avengers Movie That I Watched ,Then I Started Watching  All  Parts Of Avengers Movies And Now I Become Fan Of This Frenchies..🔥🤩😂
Anyone here in 2022
Whenever I watch these two trialers , it always give me goosebumps
Someone understood why Vision been one f the most powerful avengers in infinity war is like a puppy in the all <br>movie? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Yo this movie and trailer was insane! just imagine how  Avengers the kang dynasy trailer will be!
The amount of sheer hype and excitement for this film were unreal and my God did it live up to it
Just had to revisit just to see black panther suit up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=90">1:30</a> .... Chillls everytime
I find it hilarious that every alien from outer space can speak english
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=106">1:46</a> they edited the gauntlet to remove some of the stones to prevent the trailer from becoming a spoiler. At that point, he was only missing one stone.
Wow it&#39;s 4 years ago
Better then Endgame
Secret wars and kang gonna be the same hype🗿
Ever fvrt movie❤❤❤
Oh we’re using our made up name then I’m SPINER man
Thanos

Fun fact - Bruce never became hulk in infinity war but was shown in trailer <br>This is how a trailer should be made that made Phase 3 and infinity saga the best phase in history of MCU

4 years later
I can’t wait for this to release !!
Wait, why I am here?
CGI in this movie was absolutely amazing
Can’t wait for Kang Dynasty
Absolute banger of a trailer! Still even after seeing the movie multiple times. It still makes me want to see it.
El algoritmo de YouTube me trajo a dónde fui feliz
what a shitty movie
This is and will be the best mcu film ever. After 4 years this is still gives me goosebumps.
If you remember the hype around this movie your a living legend 💥💥💥💥
¿Any one in 2022? 🔥
I&#39;m from Brazil here 2022 Caraí nostalgia reever this trailer there I shivered the same way as when the movie came out
4 years already……
1559 days ago I feel old!😞37,416 hours, 2,244,960 minutes and 134,697,600 seconds. WISH WE COULD GO BACK!🥲
Just imagining when Internet breaks after the release of AVENGERS: Kang Dynasty trailer.
That Bass gets me every time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=115">1:55</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> “DUM DUM DUMMMM.”
still so amazing that we got to see all these different heroes in different films together. DC catch the hell up
Dr strange: We&#39;re in Kang Dynasty now
Why I am here🙃
By far thr BEST marvel movie. I truly dont believe any other will top what was achieved with the Infinity War
Tell me his name : Thanos literally gives goosebumps
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=74">1:14</a> to see Thor not holding stormbreaker
muere thanos lol
This movie looks like its gonna be good
This is being recommended to me 4 years later and I’m not mad at all this trailer still gets me hyped. I hope Secret Wars is just as good and hopefully better.
Years later and the goosebumps still rising all over
Super epic <br>Wish i could turn back time to see it again when it first released
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS DISNEY PLUS LEAKED THE ENTIRE MOIVIE YOU CAN BUY A LEAKED COPY AND YOU CAN FIND LEAK CLIPS ON YOUTUBE
Memang hype gila filem ni pada zaman dia dulu
Que saudade
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This trailer is still epic. You know what, I&#39;m gonna watch this again now.
I can still get goosebumps from this trailer in 2022
Nostalgia
Senin de 2022 de keşfetine çıktı
Best character thanos
Как фильм? норм?
Endgame was awesome, but Infinity War was peak MCU. Downhill from here
whos here after secret wars announced
man this is the peak mcu we know!! phase 4 is not even near it.
Its 2022, why the f am I watching this..?
God I loved this trailer. Can&#39;t wait to eventually see  the Avengers Kang Dynasty and Avengers Secret Wars trailer.
Being recommended this years later,I feel old because it feels like this movie only came out a few days ago 🥲
Hey we gotta give it to Star Lord we all laughed but it was HIS plan that worked if he didn’t mess it up hitting Thanos 🤣
The trailer is still recommended until now
Watched this in the cinema, haven&#39;t rewatched it since. Nothing comes close to the experience.
Nothing will ever beat Thor landing in wakanda with the guardians! I’ve never seen a theater blow up with such excitement the way it did when he m brought down the hammer and broke the ground with storm breaker! Simpler times!
Remember when Marvel used to release great movies like this?... What happened to them?.
hopefully we get there again
This trailer gives me goosebumps
Even after 4 years this trailer still gives me chills 🥶
Ayo what happened to Youtube... suddenly it has started recommending me all old movies trailer... the oldest being Age of Ultron 🤔🤔
Who got recommendations of this trailer in 2022
POV trying to find a comment from 4 years ago
Remember when people called this garbage. Everyones taking that back and calling what we have now garbage. haha
EMOCIONADO DESDE PERÚ🎞🎞🎞🎞🎉🎉🎉🎉
New Trailer!
Still amazing 🤩
It’s blowing my mind how many recent comments are the top comments. It just goes to show how much love was put into this film and received by us the fans.
The hype from this movie was a once in a lifetime experience.
Im here before Marvel confirm Avengers Secret Wars
Just got recommended to me again today. Nice. Still a great trailer.
What I&#39;d give to watch this film for the first time again.
Anyone here revisiting this masterpiece yet again?
Marvel will find it very hard to create better music than this for their future films
Ahhh yes🔥 the golden daays
Nostalgia....oh it&#39;s 2022...
<b>4 Years Ago</b>
Still got goosebumps, can&#39;t believe that this happened 4 years ago
4 years later, I still got this on my recommendation page
4 years, still watching this master piece
The Age of Ultron from 7 years ago popped up in my feed a couple hours ago and now this one from 4 years ago... Definitely getting a sign of something...
From 2022
The allknowing algorithm brought us here after 4 years
Still get goosebumps
Still pretty much my favorite movie
I&#39;m here after avengers secret wars and kang&#39;s dynasty announce😎
I sure hope Secret Wars is gonna make Infinity War look like Civil War.
will never get tired of watching this
I just got goosebumps from a trailer made 3 yrs ago, even after the fact that I&#39;ve re-watched the movie a lot
New trailer , cant wait to see the movie
Marvel definitely peaked here
Mannn
This one and Endgame is better than Phase 4
I remember my testicals tightening when the movie started
I’m sorry but I miss the days of this type of marvel. Idk recent marvel doesn’t feel the same, this movie was truly peak
So what&#39;s the next Avengers Movie after End Game? 🤔
This trailer is still better then whole phase 5👍
Let&#39;s see how Kang dynasty and secret wars compete against this
Wait untill you see this one,  everybody dies
Just opened youtube and saw this suggestion and thought they released Avengers The Kang dynasty trailer but end up watching this one still one of the epic movie of all time 🧡
I remembered for endgame i was like uuu what’s gonna happen and excited<br><br>But i recall for this movie i was like turn it to 11 kinda hype<br><br>It’s a better movie for me although endgame has a lot of iconic moments
Still Worthy trailer 🔥❤️
This movie was peak, best MCU movie imo, I hope The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars will somehow top this and Endgame
That feeling watching for the first time when Cap stops Thanos hand to hand, is unforgettable
Cant believe how many takes were cut or re done in here, the ones they went with in the film are far better tho tbf so they made the right decision
I want to see How Kang the Conqueror will best this .<br><br>Antman :You dont know who you are messing with .I&#39;m an Avenger.<br><br>Kang: I&#39;m a conqueror<br><br>😁😁😁
Bro this was 4 years ago?
This still gives me chills
Great movie. What a shame the Russo brothers have sold out their craft to shill Netflix made for TV movies now.
I still remember where I was when this first came out, incredible. The nostalgia, dude 🙌
Take me back to 2018.😭😭😭
wow new Trailer
Who is here after the announcement of Avengers kang dynasty and secret wars?
I miss this so much <br>The hype was 😭😭
Watching infinity war for the first time was unmatchable feeling
Best movie ever♥️
Dawn of the seven looks better than this
Holy wowzers can’t wait for this epic movie to come out
4 years and still amazing 💞❤️
Anyone watching in 2022?
4 years later ❤❤🔥🔥
I never understood ‘tears of joy’ until I watched this trailer 4 years ago. It makes me so happy that I can’t help but cry with pleasure and satisfaction😂 I feel so elated at every moment of this trailer!!! The entirety of Marvel Phase 3 was a privilege that I will never forget, thank you to everyone involved in Marvel Phase 3❤️
The best Avengers movie. Seeing them all come together after civil war was amazing... Then that ending.
Its Sunday, 31 July 2022. 4 years later and the goosebumps I&#39;m getting are the same as the day this trailer released.
There r people who watched this straight without previous Mcu films only Bcos of hype.
Dopo 4 anni ancora uno dei migliori film della storia
Brooooo so nostalgic
Why am I getting this trailer in my feed? Is this a secret message or something lol 😂
What a legacy marvel made
Thank you recommendations 😂
Still the excitement remains same. 😍
I am a huge Snyder Verse fan and I came here after Marvel has announced the next sagas for their cinematic run. I really admire Russo brothers for their brilliant handling of such big characters in a single universe. They really managed to keep it all balanced. Infinity War is one of the best from Marvel.<br><br>Meanwhile WB, is busy antagonising their own fanbase. Typical WB behaviour.
&quot;THIS IS EPIC&quot;<br>NOW and FOREVER
i cant wait for it to come out 😁
Here i am, almost 4 years later, reliving one of the greatest moments in cinematic history
Watching it at 2022
I got recommended for the trailer after all this time? Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Bu niye şimdi karşıma çıktı
The last good avengers movie we got
Got recommended 31st July ,2022
I bet we ain&#39;t gonna get this much hype in ka ng or secret cause this is so well made and the build up was legit the best
ahh, man... I still know how 5 of my friends and I goes to watch a marvel movie. that time, hype was real.
We can livs the past seeing this epic thing in 2022 August 🥴
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=113">1:53</a> Imagine This music in Avengers secret war😭😭
Is anyone here watching in 2022 😂
The way Marvel did this was perfect. The new movies after Endgame just don&#39;t have the same feel
This movie still looks way better than any movie that marvel studios has produced for phase 4
who watching the trailer in full 2022
For the peeps watch this from 4 yrs ago they a real one the get the n word pads
Still the best Avengers movies
4 years later and this trailer still gives me goosebumps
That was one hell of a movie man
Was this really 4 years ago?! Jeez time flies
Melhor filme de herói já feito
This is a once in a lifetime
It’s already been 4 years since this amazing film
Infinity War was successful because it built tension and was serious for once. Marvel need to create more high stakes, serious films. <br>Thor Live &amp; Thunder should’ve been that, instead we got a circus on crack cocaine.
Remember leaving the cinema at 3am sad and trying to figure out wtf just happened and what will happen in endgame
He did it.
Infinity War Trailer One was the best, Endgame Trailer Two was the best. Imo. Just the build up of the music and everything was incredible. And the Guardians reveal in Infinity War Trailer 1 was incredible.
👏
If they do it right secret wars will wash both infinity war and endgame
Why am I getting this on my home page now?😂
this movie and the force awakens were unbeatable in hype
This trailer brought some different level of hype I can’t lie
I don&#39;t think there will ever be a movie that had as much hype as this one and endgame
Got this recommended after 4 years.
4 years ago. We saw one of the greatest hype train of all time.
5 years later, Rick Grimes has finally returned 👆👆👆🤙👋
Russo Brother made a masterpiece and for once in a life time in MCU.Hope they join again
I got this in the recommendation now<br><br>Chilla
already 4 years time flies
I see cap holding thanos&#39;s fist and remember what joker told luthor about batman &quot;there is nothing mere about that mortal&quot;
I deadass was in awe after watching this me and the boys watched it at the chabot theatre in castro valley instant classic
i miss you
Great memory 😭
Marvel at Its Finest
Algorithm recommend me after 4 yr
They really put fake scenes in the trailer 😂
Goosebumps
After iron man died and captain America left Avengers my interest and excitement in Marvel has left over, we miss them
I can watch this movie infinity times and won&#39;t get bored but endgame somehow somewhere doesn&#39;t give this much level of chill<br>Endgame is masterpiece but still you&#39;ll get bore on certain level
Thanos seems like a glass half full kind of guy.
Wait they showed hulk buster in trailer
Good times.
어빈져스 말고 다른 영웅까지 모이는건 진짜 그냥 레전드임
Peak Marvel.
Geeeeee
I still get chills when I see this trailer
Even after 4 years this trailer gave me goosebumps 🔥🔥♥️
oh man I can&#39;t wait for this movie to come out
My favourite MCU Movie🤩🔥🔥🔥
this still feels so epic no matter how many times I watch it 😭
Love the music
Im here in 2022 jul 30
This was the last time the MCU had me crazy excited to see some of their character finally interact. We don&#39;t get that anymore. Now it&#39;s crossovers in everything they do. But seeing Quill talk to Iron Man was such a crazy thing to see.
Can&#39;t wait for this.
That Fuckin&#39; Tony&#39;s Bleeding Edge Armor 🔥
Aun recuerdo el hype que creó esta película, ojala puedan replicarlo con Kang dynasty y secret wars
Wish we could all go back and watch this again for the first time
Watching this after such a long time and knowing everything it hits different
If Kang Dynasty can come anywhere near this movie I’d be very impressed. Marvel should get all the credit it deserves.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=110">1:50</a> The musical transition here is just so perfect. It went from despair to hope, using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the avengers theme. I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in, you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU.
Это тебе не girl bands
These were probably the greatest movie trailers of all time. Endgame was a better movie but it didnt have as good of trailers which honestly made endgame better
Cant wait for this movie to come out
Avengers in my feed 4y later<br>Ive never clicked faster in my life
Ah yes, all the avengers against just a purple guy, wonder what could go wrong, can&#39;t even think whether that purple guy will be spared or not...
OMGGG THE TRAILERS OUT!!! I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS!!!
Eu sou o comentário que você procura🇧🇷🤭
I miss them all
After 4 year the goosebumbs still continue
Youtube recommend me this Video👍😊
subtitles be like ; <br>Tony: Tell me his name again?<br>Gamora: Santos.
Anyone watching this 4 years later
Infinity war &gt;&gt; endgame
I want to wash my memory just to experience this masterpiece one more time 🖤
Peak mcu 👌✌️
This trailer was so good I went cinemas to watch this movie and it was the best decision. Usually just waited for superhero movies to get home releases but that atmosphere on opening night was different.
The experience of this movie was once in life.
Now after 3 years it is gonna be this but Kang and Doom
Still goosebumps
HYPEREEEE IS HERE ALL THE TIMEEE
anyone in 2022?
Recommended
When I first saw this trailer , I thought chris Evan may be replaced by any other actor . Bcz it&#39;s was totally unrecognizable with his beard . Bt he looks awesome with this Look 🔥🔥
Trust me, this is the best MCU movie till now. I hope Black Panther 2 will surpass it.
Bro, The Avengers are just gonna beat Thanos. I bet Thor is gonna kill him. Probably go for his head.
this was on my recommended
One of the best movies to ever be made.
Secret Wars is gonna blow the hype of this movie out of the water
Still fresh
Will the Multiverse saga finale be as big as the Infinity saga?
Avergers Secret War 2025
I still can&#39;t believe this movie didn&#39;t pulled me into the theater....last movie I saw on the big screen was........ DISTRICT 9...... 😭......
Imagine when Kang Dinasty and Secret Wars come out
La  mejor 🤑🤑🤑
Peak MCU, I doubt that Kang Dynasty or Secret wars can live up to the hype and storytelling.
I really don’t think they can beat this and endgame we’ll just have to wait and see
i remember all my family social circles just did a standstill in all our personal lives, just to watch this movie. what a good time to be alive.
No way! cant wait for this to come out!
The fact that this was 4 years ago <br> plus seeing the phase 5 coming this 2023 and the phase 6 with Avengers:Kang dynasty and secret war  give me chills🔥🔥
Marvel fix your mess man. What are you guys even doing now. Dialogues, CGI, Story, all over the place. Geez, people want movies too, not just too many goddamn shows.
Ah... simpler times...
now we wait for avengers  kang dunasy and secret wars!
We can never have another Avengers movie like this one. Period. The end. Over and out.
hi 👋🏻
If infinity war and endgame had such a hype, just imagine, imagine how much hyped secret wars would be.
They made money with this and now they are just cashing in on our emotions
only if Dr Strange told us how bad MCU would get 😣
2018-Infinity war<br>2019-endgame<br>2021-no way home<br>2025-secret wars,Kang dynasty
YouTube recommend really brought this back. I’m not mad at though
This was the only underdog marvel movie ever
This trailer never Gona lade
bro it’s 2022 and i just got so excited
Greatest movie of ALL TIME.
Why is this in my recommended in 2022
This movie came in india on 27 April 2018 and I lost my mother on 30th April 2018 and in my case HIV virus was Thanos for us
Still watching on 2022 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=110">1:50</a> still gives the chills!
marvel aint gonna make a movie as good as this and endgame for a long time
Avengers Secret Wars brought me here
This phase hits no 1
All downhill since
why did i get this on my recommendation page just now.. is marvel telling us something 😭
Ahh yes the once in a lifetime experience, it’s a shame that marvel didn’t stop making movies after endgame cause everything after that is dumpster fire garbage <br>They should have just ended it on a high after the climactic buildup of 10 years
This just appeared on my recommendations after the recent  announcement of phase 5 and 6 😭
Thanos is a kid wait for KANGs..He is different because he has killed all Avengers infinite amount of times
Man i wanna live that moment again
Back when marvel movies were good
Avengers:infinite war<br>4 years ago <br> Avengers:Endgame <br>3 years ago
This is one of the best trailers in my option, never been hyped about a movie like this one before!
Why am I still shaking while watching this?
The best director ruso brothers
After the recent project announcements . Wow
When you realize cap and iron man are still on different teams for the entirety of IW and never met till end game
The tubnail said new trailer, but it writes 5 years
Better than Endgame in my opinion
man this was something else.
Best movie argue with the wall
THIS WAS 4YRS AGO😯😯
infinity war hype will never be topped
Secret wars better have this much hype
Why was this recommended to me 4 years later idk but hey the movie just,just amazing for me besides no way home it’s no 1 for my movie list and that’s due plot and also my sister spoiled endgame before i saw it😁🥲
Anyone relieving old memories in 2022?
Wow a new movie?! When does this come out! Wait, cap and iron man died! 🤔
the hype for this was real af imagine phase 6 hype
Who is watching still 2023😂
Who’s here after comic con and learning about two avengers movie in 2025
cant wait to watch this movie!!! im so excited
Lmaoo I remember watching those trailer breakdown videos I&#39;m miss that eraa
I feel sorry for Secret Wars, having to go up against this.
The hype Was unreal
Infinity war is the best theatrical experience I&#39;ve ever had
THIS WAS ALMOST 5 YEARS AGO NOW WERE GETTING KANG DYNASTY AND SECRET WARS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=71">1:11</a> this scene should have been in the movie
Hey i am from 2022<br>..still remembering 2018 scenarios ...of darkish looks of thanos
Just here to revisit the memories after Avengers 5,6 got announced. Still no movie can break the hype like Infinity War &amp; Endgame. Missing RDJ, Chris Evans, ScarJo &amp; Chadwick so much 🥺
I wish I had a time machine ❤️🔥
This is the greatest movie that Marvel ever made.
English cc at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8&amp;t=26">0:26</a> got me dying lol<br>“Tell me his name again”<br>“SANTOS”🤣🤣🤣🤣

Hello
Кто решил посмотреть в 2022 году?
its been 4 years and this movie is still one of the best mcu films if not the best
지금 봐도 웅장하다❤️‍🔥
Best avenger movie I remember the hype man I remember waiting in 2017 for this movie to come out I remember Thor scene still gives me chills to this day
my fav avenger movie, right up there with winter soldier as my fav marvel movie
i miss tony stark and chadwick
Who&#39;s here after the announcements of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars?
Oh Man! This stuff just got real, I can&#39;t wait till tickets come on sale,I&#39;m taking my whole family.
Omg
Who&#39;s watch this tellers in 2022
I want go back at this time 🥲
Just imagine what they could do with Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars trailers. I honestly cannot wait for another Avengers film with all the new characters and new experiences. Avengers trailers always have the best orchestras and everything in it. Bring it on Phase 5 and 6 we are all here for it!
Is it me or everyone got recommended ❤️
OMG I can&#39;t wait to see thi.... Oh yeah
People like dc fans like to hate on marvel but they can’t deny everything before phase 4 and after mid phase 2 were some of the best movies. And movies like secret wars, kang dynasty guardians 3 and ant man seem like where the new phase returns to the greatness of the old films.
Wish I could turn back time🥺
steel gate goosebumps 2022
Who&#39;s rewatching this in 2022 and still get goosebumps?
Whos here in 2022
