terraria
I was about to comment how annoying this video was, before realizing what channel it is. I&#39;ve heard of it but never seen a video. Confirms why I never looked it up.
g(old)
Pewds comedy. Gold.
You start by exploring your new world. You end with a pig shark seal bird and squidward tentacles from the moon.
Welcome Traveler you are back after all of these years you have returned to this amazing play though
Youtube algorithm recommend me this and i love it😂
Man why is my comment deleted it was<br>about N word
Omg it just disappeared
Pewds should bring back gaming week<br>But instead of gaming week<br>Gaming strong
Scheelite, was previously named Tungsten by its sweedish discoverers. And indeed thats where the name comes from
❤
Spoilers:<br>There&#39;s still stuff to do after beating the moon lord(final boss) like getting the zenith the most powerful weapon using 10 of the most powerful swords.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=680">11:20</a> A zombie and a pogo merged...
Connor is like the water sheep of terraria lol
felix filling up the holes he digs warms my heart
jean pierre polnareff
Gotta love terreria
He should play terraria again
He said I don’t don’t need paints but when it’s armor
The pain when he made a lead short sword instead of a normal sword😢
The best weapon in terraria is the Zenith and you definitely not a veteran in the game.
I was like this at first when i played this game this game i just built a house and stabed the animals.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

I like how he got his priorities straight because sometimes people just be all over the place. But PewDiePie already has a house and weapons/armor in the first episode. Like usually people would explore and stuff.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=248">4:08</a> literally. Terraria ost SLAPS.
Ive never seen anyone beat a vultures axx with a yoyo! 😅😂😂😂 love you Pewds 🤮🐺🌙👊🏼

Can we all appreciate how he made an NPC suitable house by accident?
pila
Right. Click.
I miss Pewds’ gaming videos
He would severely benefit from pressing control.
You kill the bunny it&#39;s say DOOM GUY APPROACHES FROM AFAR
I switched from zenith to yoyo after watching this 💀
As an experienced terrarian the shortsword hurt my soul

Peepee poopoo check
I was like &quot;wait what pewds has 4k hours?!&quot; And then he&#39;s just like &quot;those were all lies&quot;. My world is shattered 😂, i feel like the devil may cry screen when you complete missions.

когда это я начал понимать английский
Can’t believe this was a thing for a while, pewdiepie playing terraria, I think I was so hyped bc I had been playing for a long time, that and Minecraft have been phenomenal series.
Feels like it was just yesterday
Here 3 years later
I thought u didnt know to how to play terraria but u know how to play terraria
Is any one gonna talk about the pink slime day 2

Bro he is tried from editing
Omg this vid pops up in my recommendations guess I&#39;d watch these series again.
If your 4k makes you a veteran, consider me a legend!
hey that&#39;s the oldest
I played so much Minecraft in my early teen years and just recently I tried terraria and it’s literally so much better, I don’t know if it’s cause I’m just bored of Minecraft now but I just have so much fun on terraria I don’t know why I never played it years ago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1181">19:41</a><br><br>autism kicks in
Connor: <b>*is your one friend in this cruel world and ready to help you with craft*</b><br>Pew: Ull dai
Yoyo to joyo to JOJO!!!!!
red should add a guide dialogue to connor that says &quot;these fricken slimes are everywhere!&quot;
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br>Pewds moment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1541">25:41</a>

Here because switch told me to check it ... Had no idea they were promoting a old vid, but this is great!
As a terraria veteran, I appreciate this content. Visual happiness  😊
bro strip mined in terrria
BRO FOUND THE RARE PINKY 1/180 chance
So glad I found this. A lot of times it can be pretty annoying watching people start a game with a lot of complex things cause idk waiting for them to understand feels like it takes forever but pewdiepies reactions to everything are just so funny
Pewdiepie got me into terraria, now I have mastered master mode and am ready for legendary mode
I love how everyone, without fail, kills a squirrel/rabbit on their first playthrough, and immediately regrets it
and he should play tmodloader
Felix is just like me
Felix:can you make beds in mi-terraria
This is so nostalgic, I keep rewatching this series!
I one of the strongest weapons armors<br><br>😂
nice playthrough man
I play Terraria
The first mistake of him was to craft a wooden armor. The armor points are not worth it, that your character looks that ugly then.. xd<br><br>and btw; trees grow faster if there are like 2/3 blocks between them. make it 3 just to be sure and because thats the best for minecraft too
Its pronounced led
3 years later realises * ignores the pinky and never gets the cash prize :_ *
watch my latest video about the difference in fps in terraria please
@PewDiePie hi iam u r new subscriber I like the subscriber count. :111m
pewdiepie is like that one annoying kid who watches too much anime
Felix: it’s like minecraft <br>Terraria:I was made months before him
One thing about terraria is that one little upgrade makes the game easier and easier just like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=913">15:13</a>
Anyone here has this vid on there recommended?
Proceeds to never complete the game
It&#39;s both funny and infuriating to watch him play
bunAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
i love that he says he&#39;s so good and he doesn&#39;t even know how to play
i watched this video when it came out and now seeing it after beating the game multiple times and playing the game in general<br><br>it makes me remember all the times i would rewatch the same video over and over <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i wasn&#39;t signed it so i couldn&#39;t watch them all so i rewatched<br>:)
That Antolín swarmed combo tho
&quot;Yes I did a thing!&quot; - Pewdiepie
when he made the lead short sword I cried a little bit
The world is awful !
this game has so bad graphics
i wish u didnt stop playing
what i say to my girlfriend on a daily basis:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1503">25:03</a>
what i say to my girl bestfriend:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1503">25:03</a>
i havent played this game for a while, i did random shit when i first played, i was six at the time, i should be good at it now.
Great vunleabrities of kyf
Funny that this is the reason why I play terraria and every single time I make the tower of IKEA as a starting npc residence
fucking “leed “
Jag gillar hur Felix säjer att han inte är fattig, medans han har en guld peng, 9 koppar och 7 silver. LoL
I watched this when it came out I&#39;m 3 years older now 2023 jan18 12:08am
Minecraft players playing terraria: This looks just like minecraft<br>Terraria players playing minecraft: This looks nothing like terraria
did the guide just kill the bunny that jumped up?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=208">3:28</a> LIKE A BOWS
Damn noisy
nice vid bro
dint pewdiepie know that despawning exist now his angry at guide
According to me who has played terraria for 4 years, pewd is playing much better than when I played terraria for the first time
Who else missed watching him playing this game? I remember I got soooo hyped when he first uploaded a video terraria.
me: watching at 111 million subs and 11 million views 1.1 million likes<br>nah tat is false
You should join my terraria world-
Soy Terrarianopapu
&quot;LEAD&quot; not lead
I miss these days
Cool video
I miss PewDiePie
THERE ARE DOGS NAMED SVEN!
Pewds: Uses sword on squirrel. Also Pewds: I DIDN&#39;T THINK IT WOULD DO ANYTHING! XD
Pewdiepie:learns game in matter of minutes<br>Me:dosent know how to place a banner and gets scared of bunnies

Conner WANTED - Alive or Dead

Why the lead short sword and not the normal sword
Cuz the FDC won’t let me be. I see you press.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=633">10:33</a> pewds= I mean no harm! 2 seconds later… DIE DIE
I’m also a Terraria Veteran and I’m already epic, and I’m very pro and intelligent at the game, because I find all the cool and rare stuff in the game, like the blindfold for example, and that took forever to get and I had to wipe out an entire race of shadow slimes
&lt;3
Him saying poor has similar vibes of Andrew Tate saying brokie
god i know hes a minecraft veteran and that he doesnt know but the house to me<br>sadness
Tungsten was originally known as wolfram as it came most often from it. Later, it was called tungsten due to the fact that it&#39;s heavy and is found in stone. Therefore, tung (heavy) sten (stone)

Forget classic you need to play calamity mod:(
Lol, me rewatching Terraria series all over again...just like I did with the Minecraft one...
fun fact: yes you can craft a meatball in terraria but its a weapon that is made out of crimson bars
peediepie: WUUUU CUCKTOOS CHAAR???? terraria: lets make a cuckoos tolet
I don&#39;t know why...but i am here again.
i played this game in scratch LOL
This is Guile hair cut from street fighter lol
Pewds: What are they smoking when they made this?<br><br>Cactus chair:  . . . .
Bruh
its zoomed in the entire fucking time
Took me 130 hours to beat  this game lol
I love how he says lead wrong
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=530">8:50</a> Pewds, the killer of bunnies
This is to date, my favorite PewDiePie thumbnail.
I like how he screamed bunnyyyy! When the bunny died 😂😂😂
He needs to play terraria 1.4.4
Felix: can you go to the moon in terraria<br><br>No the moon comes to kill you
its funny 😂😂<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=334">5:34</a>
&quot;Minecart? Can i make a minecraft in minecrorft?&quot;
I don&#39;t understand anything because I&#39;m from Ukraine and my English is very bad, but I like it
rocking the Ford shirt
Play it again bro &lt;3 hit has lots of things 😂😂😂
Its been 2y! who got recommended this???
As a sidenote try Planet Centauri it&#39;s like terraria but it also has quests and you can tame and ride stuff, wanna ride a cow ok, wanna ride a flippin T rex ok. Also you can turn into animals to with a magic stone. I just bought it. I think I like it.
I want to see you play Rimworld. I was suprised to see no such video when I searched. Seems like a perfect game for you considering how crazy it seems to be. Much stuff can happen there and it has overwhelmingly positive reviews on steam.
Come back to terraria
Noice

U are literally the reason I have terraria, thank u for bringing it into my life &lt;3
I like how pewdiepie is treating terraria like there’s Minecraft features in it
Legends says this is how mineshafts were created

“Connor do something” 😂😂
Who wishes Felix would be their best friend and neighbor
Felix is without question hilarious
So popular that nintendo can&#39;t deny it
&quot;I know chopping trees is the way to go.&quot; Mr. Beast comes over and kills him.

I spent half an hour trying to use the workbench and EVERYONE just figures it out. It took me a day to figure out I could place down the wood from trees. I was so confused why zombies walking into my house
Me and my friend watched this no joke this was mine and his reaction<br>My friend: “Bruh he’s just playing 2D minecraft ripoff”<br>Me: facepalms and searches up why terraria is not 2d minecraft and made him watch it till he admited it wasnt<br>Now he loves terraria XD
I remember the very first time I played terraria and I spawned in a corruption biome.🤣
I like tarrarie

“I mean no harm”<br>“Die, die, die, all of you”<br>-Pewdiepie
connor is a guide tells you how the game works the guide tells you how to get npcs (peoples)<br>you need a light source (lamp) a chair and a table the npcs will move to your town if theres an arms dealer buy guns

What I&#39;m attracted to Pewdiepie&#39;s videos is the way he plays the game spontaneously and doesn&#39;t care about the mistakes he makes.<br>From Viet Nam with love &lt;3

I remember when I watched this video for the first time, I was so amazed and I downloaded a pirate version of terraria(It was 1.3.0 while the game was like 1.3.5) But I bought terraria after 1 year, when I had completed terraria on the pirate version. Good times, ah, good times.
Many bunnies were harmed in the making of this video
I hope after Skyrim , Pewds goes back to Terrraria to finish it<br><br>he ddint finish both game hahasadge

He actually found Pinky on the second day
Hey PewDiePie I actually I was what I was just like you whenever I was lonely game literally and now I have the nights edge
Mans character lookin like von stroheim
I am the first comment in the 3/12/2021
I started really similar except it took me an hour to figure out how to craft because i thought it was like in minecraft where you have to click on it not open the inventory
“Leeed”
i wish pewds&#39;ll play this fantastic game again....
I like how Connor just walks in as if it&#39;s a 90s sitcom
its been exactly 2 years from when video was releasd
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=146">2:26</a> says he didnt think it would do anything after hitting the squirle twice
I assume the further down you go the more epicness you get, just like wamen. <br><br>Guys with 2inch peepee : sad noises*

mr beast please look away &gt;&lt;
when someone says &quot;try 2d minecraft&quot;
This makes me miss terraria
Pewds: can you make meatballs in this game?<br>Me: well… I mean… kinda…
“Can you build a meat ball in terraria”… yes? Technically it is called the meatball
I mean you no harm DIE <b>aggressively stabs</b>
PewDiePie would be happy we have dogs in terraria now and I think you can get the name Sven
Everyone else chillin.          Pewdiepie: cactus chair
Nic
tungsten is actually the heaviest metal, also i find it funny you&#39;re wearing a ford racing jacket
His character looks like polnareff
If you want the &quot;guy&quot; you need a housing<br>A housing require crair,table,torch,wall<br><br>You dont need a mincart to ride the rail
Your tin lead can make a better thingies
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1077">17:57</a> is a JOJO REFERENCE

Felix makes character ekhm I mean polnareff 😂
Pewdiepie: i am slaying <br><br><br>Moonlord: allot me to introduce myself
I think the yoyo is good for pic players but cactus sword is good for mobile players but that&#39;s just what I think
this is money game :/
There are diamonds but they are useless
I already beat the game months ago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1538">25:38</a> when I see pewds playing terraria
This is the very first time I ever watched this guy&#39;s video and I gotta say I now know why people keep talking about oompa looking like PewDiePie
Yes Diamonds are in the game
TERRARIA GANG!!
Pinkkie: 6 damage<br>Felix: Omg its super strong<br>Meanwhile master mode enemies: Am I a Joke to you?
Its really fun to see youtubers react to new stuff<br><br>Btw, terraria veteran here
i love how he kept confusing lead with mercury and told us to not drink it though we can&#39;t unless heated a lot lol
Beat me... İN CALAMİTY!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=343">5:43</a>
Dont kill Bunneh
Bunneh is love
&quot;Can you Frick in TeRRaria !?&quot; <br>~A YouTuber with more than 110 million subscribers.
“Cactus Chair! What were they smoking when they made this!” My insides hurts!🤣
Did he accidentally make polnareff??? The pants and the shirt changed colors tho
I was gonna say that he will kill so many bunnies with the shield of Cthulhu but i remember he doesn&#39;t even play expert mode.
Minecraft and Terraria Expert:Terraria will always be better than Minecraft, fyi I&#39;m the Minecraft and Terraria expert
Sees demon eye... “can I pause?!”
everybody should know that &quot;this is not a hotel&quot;
Me who has beat terraria: phatetic

Who had that ouch moment after Felix crafted a Short-sword xD

It hurts to see him place the wall of the house, but then make the frame AFTER!!!😩

Pewdiepie is not getting that much subscribers
Everything becomes becomes better when filex touches it
I feel pain when watching this. Terraria is infinitely more sophisticated than minecraft. There are many bosses, mobs, weapons, ores, merchants and even a second part to the game, with a hallow biome. Please become a pro at Terraria, like me!
Pewdiepie:&quot;Ikea tower will be the largest structure this world has ever seen&quot;<br>Floating islands:&quot;I&#39;m about to break this whole man&#39;s career&quot;
Felix: Stabs squirrel with a sword....*Squirrel dies* <br>Felix: Noooooooooooooooooooooooo
i just started playing today
it’s more fun watching pewds than playing the game
Why did he pick the lead shortsword. the lead broadsword is way better
Ben despawned lol.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1126">18:46</a> so... connor it&#39;s a homosexual or what the fuck??
Why does the Thumbnail look like jacksepticeye
kills a bunny<br>&#39;i swear i won t do that again&#39;<br><br><br><br><br>kills 3 more
He wants to kill guide
He is like I&#39;m strong cactus sword does 9 damage <br><br>The actual veterans have the terra blade which does 200 damage
FINALLY TERRARIA
Best terraria series in youtube
Im got terraria
I have returned to watch once more, amazing gameplay Pewds!
felix character reminds me of a street fighter characters with yellow blond hair whit that hairstyle and a tank top and sum baggy jeans
Even though this video is old I want to see this man suffer
مين مفتهملوش ولا شي 😂
I just played a few days ago and it&#39;s been so long I forgot how to make walls and I died so many time at night houseless.
Just here rewatching the series to reminisce those sweet memories.
If anybody has it on ps4 add me and we can trade
“I won’t do that again, I Swear”
bruh his hair is koichi or little polnarref
JOTAROOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
bruh, i just bought this game and thought it was a platformer.
I play terraria and you did pretty good for a start in this episode
The whole poor jokes all the time I don&#39;t really find funny because it&#39;s most of us poor ass people watching your content for a laugh that&#39;s intern paying your bills so think about who&#39;s actually really poor here
This aged better than a fine wine! And by that I mean that I am enjoying watching this more so now that some time has passed
pog
Watching this after having over 200 hours in terraria is slightly cringy, like If I was there he&#39;d know how to play lol
Pewdiepie after killing 17829 bunnies’i wont do that again’
pewds using yoyo for the first time is like an anime protag learning his powers
this might have been the lowest quality video from pewds i&#39;ve ever watched
pew its so bad at terraria LMAO<br><br><br><br><br><br>its a joke
Felix: i mean no harm<br>Also Felix a few seconds: die die
Pewds: I am strong now<br>Me who has never played the game, thus making it so that no monsters can come even close to touching me, making me op:
Connor CAN talk to you xD<br>]
Pewdiepie: <b>kills slime</b> I’m good at this game!!<br>Me: <b>kills wof</b> I’m almost good
You need a table and chair to spawn npc
Egg

If the yo-yo is his dog, then it’s name should be Sven?
Yes he’s playing my favorite game and I’m rewatching it!!
&quot;What is that adorable thing? Conner stay away from it, stay away from it&quot; LOL
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=116">1:56</a> when he tries to mine a wall with a pickaxe instead of a hammer XD
im an actual terraria veteran and i cant wait to see how bad this will be
Bunny was the terraria version of Figi
And so he ended the series by locking it behind a paywall the end goodnight
alternate title: minecraft RPG
too zoomed in the entire time
Minecraft &amp; Terreria Terrcraft
Mimecraft &amp;
I like how he pronounces lead like leed instead of led lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=81">1:21</a> &quot;Minecraft be like &#39;Hands! Just use your hands!&#39;&quot; IDK what it is about this sentence that makes me laugh so much XD! Then again, it may just be the animation. lol
Yes, let&#39;s go mine some leed
:D
I got mad at work today, so Ive just bought the game
And you can also get a pet dog in terraria
Terraria finally were moon lord
I didn&#39;t know how to build on my first night so I just dug a 2×4 hole in the ground and zombies would keep coming in and killing me haha... in that same world I know have the Zentih, and the Eventide, and so much more. I love terraria too much
My names conor u talking to me?
<b>&quot;WoAh WaTer fLoWS DOwN?&quot;</b><br>Someone has clearly been playing too much Minecraft.
Borest game ever
My first time I filled my house with block instead of wall so I’m actually impressed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=674">11:14</a> -  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=692">11:32</a> OKAY YOU  WIN finally
Bro how is the video so grainy but his webcam isn’t?
This hairstyle is like an anvil!
I mean pewds
Press is not cool
hello pudidi
I mean killua kills people with a yoyo so your right
I won&#39;t do it again ......sinister laughter
Me killed a<br>Slime
Being a terraria veteran I’m deeply angered
&quot;I won&#39;t do it again I swear&quot;<br><br>proceeds to do it 10 more times
I swear terraria gameplay is B E S T gameplay
As someone who has over 100 hours of play time, I must say I&#39;m impressed
Bruh did SAAFTOO just change places
Wait the mins the demon eye did not kill the bunny Conner accident shot the arrow to bunny because he&#39;s among in the demon eye
At least he has multiple floors of his house. But seeing him knowing how to make platforms yet still leaving big holes in his floors is painful. So is the fact that he never talked to the Guide.
Pewdipie:can you make a meatball:me: : /
The best series game i ever watch so far
What&#39;s that pinky
And Conner did not kill the bunny the bunny just dispawn
And Conner  is helpful killing him would be bad
terraria veterans: facepalms*
stop killing slimes im the slime king
I am part of death<br>=)
Yes you can make bed
He kept saying &quot;I Swear&quot; But he kept doing it again😆
Every time pewds sees a new monster<br>Pewds: What are you, your scary go away.<br>Pewds seeing the same monster for the second time 10 seconds later<br>Also Pewds: WEAK!! SHORT!!!
He got a short sword instead of broadsword
Dummy person

BOGA BOGA BOGA

The bunny part had me laughing so hard
Mobile players with yoyo: auto aim on
Me looks at him with endgame guns
I think that his Minecraft day died a lot and he just kept on replacing him
Felix- I am strong now !<br><br>Nights edge- So cute<br><br>Last prism- <b>SO ADORABLE</b>
5.36 was exactly my reaction when I saw a slime killed my bunny 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Thank you for gaming terraria
ポルナレフ！！
There are diamonds just there pretty useless
Tougher enemies will cum
Whaaat?! You can make bridges in terraria?
It took me an hour to figure out that walls existed in this game 😅😅😅
This game is very hard
Pewds: This isn’t a hotel<br>Me: foreshadowing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=156">2:36</a> &quot;He can&#39;t even talk to me&quot; Lol literally the guide&#39;s entire job
in terraria u r able to mine diamonds with a fish
DIAMONDS
That one off centered wall that’s barely outside the house is giving me intense ocd
PewDiePie: I’m not poor<br>Me with my platinum coins:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1231">20:31</a> I loved that part😂
Tungsten hahahaha
Pog iron shortsword dam
:Hits a rabbit<br><br>Rabbit: dies<br><br>NOOOOOOOOO!?
Liked the video
yes there are diamonds in terraria but its super rare,i played terraria for two years and just have 11 diamonds
Lead
When I first started terraria it took me a whole hour to achieve what pewds did in three minutes you don&#39;t know how long it took me to realize I can&#39;t interact with crafting tables and furnaces.
Looks like von strohime
Pewdiepie: No ConnErs allowed<br><br>ConnOr: I&#39;m 4 parallel universes ahead of you
Felix: “can you go to the moon in terraria?”<br><br><b>No moon comes to you</b>
He said FTC <br>Flights team stand up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=83">1:23</a>
He chose violence as soon as he got in
Felix: had enough lead to make a broadsword<br>Also Felix: makes a short sword instead<br>Me: <b>T R I G G E R E D</b>
“Are there diamonds in terraria” yes. Yes there are. But they do like literally nothing
I have finished the game,and what he does at the start of the video bring me pain
&quot;Can you frick in Terraria?&quot;<br>Rule 34 artists: <b>Well....</b>
First slime he kills and he gets 50 plus silver, is that normal?
After my first twenty minutes I had an ancient shadow breastplate drop from an enemy.
PewDiePie: (is beginner and learnt very quick)<br>Me: HE IS LEARNING AT LUDICROUS SPEEDSSS!
Man it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen a door been crafted instead of using platforms
jokes on him if conner dies he has to wait for another guide because you need the guide alive to summon the wall of flesh xD
“I won’t do that again, I swear” MEANINGLESS 🥲
R.I.P Bunny
When will he know that it’s not pronounced leed it’s pronounced led.If it is just how u pronounce in in Sweden then pls don’t hate me
its funny cuz me and the guide here have the same name
His name should have been saladass
I am a terraria veteran I have not played in 6 years also I would play with my cousin and he would get all the gear all I would do was paint our house and summon bosses for fun but I’m still a veteran kinda
there is a weapon called the meat ball
Leed
What the fu*k t series add in his video
I remember pewds somewhere saying he would release an <b>adult fun</b> tape when he hits 110 mil
Hi i am from india plese tel me name in 1 june live stream 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀👻💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀☠☠💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
as a veteran, i am severely pissed that he ignored pinky. 💀💀
I can&#39;t get over the fact that he made a SHORTSWORD
&quot;How does it feel to be too short?&quot;<br><br><br>Me being 4,11: ¯\_༼ ಥ ‿ ಥ ༽_/¯
Pewdiepie: &quot;this is not a hotel&quot;<br><br>every npc: &quot;are you sure about that?&quot;
Why you hit so mach israel im have to know why you care abute this
Pewds playing genocide route in terraria
No Conners
Me: sees Ford<br><br>Me: look at the time
Conner I’m sorry you can’t sleep with me -pewdiepie<br><br>Best sentense ever spoken.
I’ve been playing since i was like 2 I would consider myself a vet
Connor:helps pewdipie<br>Pewdipie:Destroys Connor in lava<br>Me:*dislikes the video<br>My friends:bruh he helped you why did you burn Connor<br>My whole family:RIP Connor<br>Pewdipie:hey! No fair!
Do you have finch staff? I do.
It an i-bol(eyeball)
I like how no matter who you are. Terraria always hypnotizes you into killing small animals.
R.I.P bunny
Terraria is pretty much 2d Minecraft that is heavily modded
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1010">16:50</a> TOUCH IT TOUCH IT I SAID TOUCH IT!
Pewdiepie after killing 15 bunnies<br>A slime killed a bunny<br>PewdiePie: BUNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
I remember when I first got this game when I was very young <br><br>I built a tower as tall as I could just for fun <br><br>I went to the top as I built it <br><br>…And to my surprise, a horrifying raging demon bird thing has been watched me and waiting for me the entire time and it started attacking me in the sky.
Hi new sub :)
* stabs squirrel repeatedly with a sword *<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>OMG WHY DID IT DIEEEE</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>* does the same thing to a bunny and it dies *<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>* SURPRISED  PIKACHU FACE *

He made a lead shortsword. Actually kill me
less then 2 minutes in:<br>Can you frik in Terraria?

Mincraft: I loved him like my  father!<br>Terraria: I loved him like a child
That pinky thing is a pinky
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=143">2:23</a> yes, Pewds... Stabbing a squirrel with a  short sword would definitely not kill it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1032">17:12</a> pov: you see your pp once again

Felix: Can I make a minecraft in the minecrorft?<br>Terraria fans: ...sure
Can you imagine beating someone with a yoyo *laughs in earthbound *
You can get dog now
Pewdiepie: NO MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR<br>Me: this is why I never make hats in minecraft

I have NOT committed multiple cases of homocide, rape, vehicular manslaughter and have NOT dealt any child porn on the internet &quot;those were all lies by the way&quot;
Play multicraft
Yes diamonds are in terraria
My connor died while fighting
How is he so smart..not even I knew I could replant trees with acorns..
Von stroheim character i ser you

Pewdiepie is monster he is killed bunnys
Bro pewdiepie and mrbeast should play minecraft or terraria together
&quot;I swear that bird is saying bo-gah, bo-gah, bo-gah&quot; LOL. Favourite part so far

No they are no diamonds I terraria but there are diamond trees!
Click connor
“Im good at this game” digs diagonally
As a terraria veteran this almost hurts to watch
Number one rule of minecr uh Terraria is to dig straight down
I played this game since I was a kid.
Hi pewdiepie yours the best youtuber for me i love alot ashghy mean in Persian your tge best😍
bunny: <b>exists</b><br>pewds: hippity hoppity get off my property
Woaw, the water falls down
Pewdiepie i will give you solar armor if you defeat 4 boses i will give you if you online
Re-logic: killing bunnies is cruel. Period.<br>Pewdiepie: no

PewDiePie- Shanks squirrel <br>Also PewDiePie- I didn&#39;t think it would do anything
Dud how do you know the game all ready

1vs1 in terraria you are good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=153">2:33</a> Detroit: Become Guide
&quot;The more you go down the more you get epic&quot;
Well filex (I dunno if that&#39;s right)that&#39;s one thing we have in common we know nothing abt terraria and everything abt minecwaft btw love ur vids
Is anyone else annoyed that he says lead like leed lol
I have a last prism
The quote of the episode &quot;I swear I won&#39;t do it again&quot;
Bruh i wanna scream at him HAMMER for the excess walls
Fucking hate that he locked the rest of the series behind a fucking subscription.
Pewdiepie: i wont kill the bunny again <br>Pewdiepie: does it again
<b>STOP</b> <b>KILLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>RABBITS</b>
More please if you got a item you dont know go to google terrai wiki
Now that you&#39;re a Minecraft veteran. Will you be a Terraria veteran next?
It was pewds who got me hooked on terraria so I bought the game feb 23 and it is now March 28th and I 80 hours in this game it is also my favorite game so thanks pewds
pewdiepie.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=509">8:29</a> anyone notice that the mining stone sound sounds like music
I wont  do dat agen
Well in journey&#39;s end if u buy an dog license u get an chance to get sven the dog! (Buy the license from the furry girl)
He needs a mount
when i was watching this he was so patchietic
pewds: im not a veteran at terraria<br><br>also pewds 2 seconds later: im a veteran
How can someone play this trash
Pewdiepie: kills bunny <br>Also him: I won&#39;t do that again <br>Later kills bunny
thar are 13 boss in terraria
Is this a jojo reference<br><br><br><br>I mean hes character looks like polnaref
Minecraft is great, but Sandbox is the future and it will make you rich, if you get in early
Why does his character look like guile
Finally we have proof that terraria isn&#39;t a minecraft clone!
The person who killed bunnies himself:  BUNNYYYYYYYYY! YOU... (slime) TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!
I got suggested this video because Eliminate fans also watched it LMAO Girth Gang where are y&#39;all
WOW HE iGNORED PINKY
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=808">13:28</a> that&#39;s why i fill all nearby caves with sticky dirt bomb around my builds
i like how he is not digging straight down.
His hair looks like an anvil in terraria
Pewdiepie: I mean no harm<br>a milisecond later PewidePie: Die DIE  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=632">10:32</a>
Leed do you mean lean?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=415">6:55</a> the bunny massacre of 2021
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=1547">25:47</a> I thought a mosquito was flying around my ear
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=487">8:07</a> Yes, you can find Diamonds in terraria
This is like pouring the milk before the cereal at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLfYD2OOtsc&amp;t=196">3:16</a>
his character looks like polnerafle
You should take a broad sword not short sword
Dont mind me im just gonna binge watch this cuz im bored af
Used to play this with friends on mobile in like 3rd grade and it’s honestly underrated af
It hurt my physically to watch felix make shortsword when he couldve made broadsword out of lead
if you like yoyos then you might like a mace. go mining and open yelow(gold) chests. maces are yoyos but stronger
put chair and torch in house then make some shoeboxes and helpful NPCs will move in if the conditions are met(go to terraria wiki/guide(connor))
Pewdiepie sees the poor animals blood Pewdiepie :help Connor i killed a rodent and it needs to be healed
Change to 144p for best experience
Felix: &quot;Ahahah, he&#39;s too short. How does it feel to be too short?&quot;<br>Me: <b>sobbing</b> &quot;Not good.&quot;
dont drink lead paint or youll cry cry cry
its pronounced &quot;led&quot; not &quot;leed&quot;
NAH NAH NAH ITS THE SAME F WORLD AS MINE BRUH AND IM PLAYING ON NINTENDO AND I JUST GOT THE Game on CHRISTMAS
