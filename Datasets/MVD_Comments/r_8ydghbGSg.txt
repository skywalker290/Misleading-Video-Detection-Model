It really defines how beautiful her voice here is❤, she looks amazing and has a powerful message❤, Allhamdulilah ❤
Anyone in 2024-?
💓 thanks to be there
Demi Lovato will always be my favorite artist she helped me through the hardest part of growing up 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💝
Everybody listening??☔☔☔

<b>A u t h e n t i c V i e w s D a w  t C a w m</b> 💖 and Demi Lovato <br>are a match made in heaven, Best song on album this song ❤🎵🎶 😌🔥🖤😎🧡
Si tienes dificultades, lee esto ~ Sé que soy joven, pero solo quería decir que en séptimo grado estaba en un lugar muy oscuro. No podía sentir mucha emoción y tenía pensamientos de venganza y otras cosas. Pero Dios me salvó, me dio las personas en mi vida y se mostró a mí. Incluso en mis días más oscuros, él estuvo ahí conmigo, nunca me dejó. Un día, mientras estaba en la cama, comencé a orar con la mano mirando al cielo y sentí algo sosteniendo mi mano. En ese preciso momento supe que era él. Me arrepiento de todos los pecados que he cometido. Estoy lista para comenzar una nueva vida con él. Todavía hay tiempo para arrepentirnos, amarnos y creer en Cristo, porque él los perdonará❤️ Él me ayudó en los momentos difíciles, él también los ayudará a ustedes :)
I love this song. I&#39;m going through a hard breakup right now where I feel like I gave all I could, and he still left... songs like this give me strength.  💔🙌

The Good News/The Gospel: We all have sinned at one point. There’s wages to sin which is death. Committed sin=separation from God. Jesus died on a cross for humankind to have freedom out away from sin and God’s wrath&amp;to have forgiveness from God. We can receive the freedom bc He paid the wages of sin for us to live :) and He not only died, but resurrected defeating death and sin out of love. Nobody could do it except Him. Salvation=being saved. Everybody has their own Judgment Day which is the day of their death. On that day, God sees if we’d be guilty-Hell (torture) and if free of sin-Heaven(paradise). I wouldn’t wish Hell on anyone bc it’s terrible. To be allowed into Heaven (seriously) we’d need to truly repent(turning away from sin coming to an agreement with God) and follow The Law of Christ Matthew 22:37-39 Romans 7:7-9🙂💗 It’s not religion, it’s fellowship. <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2pTzTB1S-k">https://youtu.be/G2pTzTB1S-k?si=VKP6ZiFhjS4EFrDp</a>
Thank you Demi, and I believe in Aliens too, had my own experiences. God bless you!
If you see little rain with powerfull sunshine, maybe you right, Skies are crying on your area. Sometimes Skies are take a bath and shower to washing their body too, and closed their black clouds windows, and then Skies take a shower with a heavy rainfall, that called Skies take a shower.😊😊😊❤.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song reminds me of the things that have happened in my past. I’m so glad that I made it through the day and nights. I’m doing better for myself now. Thank you for this song.
My mom likes your music like skyscraper

This song makes me walking in the desert-styled forest, and myself sees two seraphim angels in the sky.

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - In The Sky” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️😊

One counting step on me toreachthis sight about it brought good take it still get out she will take myself from going to see a crowded love coming to take me to once this hit their no payback till it do
she is a bit too intense... a bit... but who knows, maybe I&#39;m tired of women singing about tall buildings
I listened to this song this past year when I finally had to cut my severely toxic, abusive alcoholic mother out of my life. What a powerful song. My goodness. I felt every bit of this song in my soul and still do. I&#39;m listening to it now just bawling my eyes out like a baby. So therapeutic.
❤
this song rightfully deserved a Grammy award.
Best song ever
I love you Demi
This song is too well done. Demi&#39;s voice has tears in it, she sings as if she&#39;s choking up. What an artist!
2023...2024 <br>D.Lovato, never scared to express Herself <br>Respectfully
Listened to this in 2017, came back in 2019, then 2023, and now January 2024!
POV: 12 years later you still find yourself searching this song 👌🏼✨
New years days enjoy 🎄😁🎉 corinna doe L 🎇😄
I went through horrible times during 2011: traumatised, full of anxiety and didn&#39;t go anywhere. This song had such a significance during that time: it made me cry and it meant something to me but I didn&#39;t fully understand it yet back then. Now I listen to that song again 13 years later and the lyrics truly hit me. Because even when he tried to tear me down, I&#39;ll be rising from the ground, like a skyscraper: and I have. It took many years but f<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ck">#ck</a> it, here I am, and nobody can ever hurt me again: Ill always be a skyscraper
Skies are crying<br>I am watching<br>Catching tear drops in my hands<br>Only silence<br>Has an ending<br>Like we never had a chance<br>Do you have to<br>Make me feel like<br>There is nothing left of me<br>You can take everything I have<br>You can break everything I am<br>Like I&#39;m made of glass<br>Like I&#39;m made of paper<br>Go on and try to tear me down<br>I will be rising from the ground<br>Like a skyscraper<br>Like a skyscraper<br>As the smoke clears<br>I awaken<br>And untangle you from me<br>Would it make you<br>Feel better<br>To watch me while I bleed<br>All my windows<br>Still are broken<br>But I&#39;m standing on my feet<br>You can take everything I have<br>You can break everything I am<br>Like I&#39;m made of glass<br>Like I&#39;m made of paper<br>Go on and try to tear me down<br>I will be rising from the ground<br>Like a skyscraper<br>Like a skyscraper<br>Go run run run<br>I&#39;m gonna stay right here<br>Watch you disappear ya yaa<br>Go run run run<br>Ya it&#39;s a long way down<br>But I am closer to the clouds up here<br>You can take everything I have<br>You can break everything I am<br>Like I&#39;m made of glass<br>Like I&#39;m made of paper<br>Go on and try to tear me down<br>I will be rising from the ground<br>Like a skyscraper<br>Like a skyscraper<br>Like a skyscraper<br>Like a skyscraper

Heaven forever no matter whos heavenly book you follow x🎉

I’m very confused? Grace Davies should be sharing such excellent content x
This should&#39;ve been her first Grammy.
Lembro de quando escutava essa música depressiva e louca assistindo este clipe chorando e cortando os cabelos na lua crescente , Demi ♥como dói
2023🎉😢😊
i ❤ u
This was one of the first songs I listened to after I ended things with my cheating ex-fiancée. I went through some hard times when that happened, but I&#39;m in a better place now with my girlfriend of two years. I credit not only my girlfriend for helping me through that anguish but also Demi for creating this song.
But clone always for herself so innocent and so sinless than the original  for about to that from the creator&#39;s judgments but why clone for wish less for herself depended to that original  good teach for good done bad teach for bad so that sinfully will be origins so for about the clone gotten to be originiality and original will be gone to the  proxy clone loses for her reality judgments will be done to the  creators when after death the laws for about in theres as you so so you reap ...s.m.a.k.
Are you proxy clone Demi fox
this is to her addiction. i love you DEMI
2023 and I still love this song such a breath of fresh air

Ever since I was 3 I loved this song I&#39;ve been searching for this song for years I&#39;m 13 now and this is my first time hearing this song in forever.. I&#39;ve finally found it..🩷
She&#39;ll always hold a special place in my heart❤ The strength this song gave me when I was a teenager. This was my lullaby throughout those years of domestic abuse. And the abuse I endured during school
Nice Demi
❤❤❤❤
If you&#39;ve ever lived with a toxic, abusive person who constantly puts you down, you will totally feel this song deep in your soul.

I&#39;ve grown up with Demi and I&#39;ve always loved and looked up to her. When this song came out, I was going through one of the hardest times in my life. I used to listen to it everyday and it helped me so much. Fast forward to now, I&#39;ve just overcame THE lowest I&#39;ve ever been and remembered this song. I went to jail. Everything i had was taken from me. And they tried to break me like i was made of glass. This song Hits home. I hope demi is doing okay now❤
I miss the old demi
Demi used to be my idol still love her music! But as she grew she turned into a not so nice person

Demi this song save my life and i come back because my mental illness will never go away and f I’m a psychiatrist patient and my obsessive compulsive disorder will never go away, never f never, friends that become foes because I’m not a happy person, they laugh as my blood was running through my arm and i saw the eyes of them, fighting to love myself the new sick me, i die when I was 18 when was inside of my brain pop up as a nightmare, I’m broken and i will be a f beautiful broken fighter of my brain chemistry

Am I the only one who compared it with the rock one😂
This was 12 years ago that’s crazy
this song hits me in a way that i cannot explain. i have a lot of repressed sadness that expresses itself in unconscious ways. when i hear this song, all my repressed emotions are awakened but i feel safe.
So lovely paradise she&#39;s at all i was love to her so really ❤❤
Wow this song was 12 years ago!
This is what I listened to when I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt. They thought I was gonna be in a vegetate state and need a liver transplant. I’m so thankful to the amazing doctors, nurses &amp; social workers for being by my side and helping me. Most of all I’m thankful for God answering my prayers. Doctor said my liver healed itself. We really are beautifully and wonderfully made.
Minha preferida ❣️😍
SHOULD HAVE NEVER SUNG THIS SONG. <br>SOUNDS TERRIBLE. <br>NEXT!

Came to watch this after watching tributes and memorial videos to the 9/11 attacks all day yesterday on 9-11-2023.  22 years after the that day that shook the world.
Nunca irei compreender como a Demi não estourou de sucesso com essa música.
❤
my friend had recommended this particular song back in 2013 when i did not even know about her. Have been listening to this since then and it never gets old.
❤❤😍😍
🎉 Maravilhosa
I remember seeing this on tv all those years ago. I remember thinking that she is so gorgeous &amp; heartfelt.
Talentosa, Hino Inesquecivel..
Eu também te amo princesa 🎉❤
eu ainda volto aqui pra chorar
Comentário brasileiro depois de ouvir penhasco ll , sinceramente achei exagerado não gostei......amei essa ela arrasa e passa sua mensagem com muita emoção❤

Ver que esta canción es del año 2011 me genera nostalgia, ya que estaba en mi niñez y pre adolescencia. Donde miraba las series y películas de Disney. Demi lovato era una de las actrices del momento!! Extraño esos tiempos... 🥺❤

They try to tear you down but you keep on rising from the the ground , like Jesus Christ.

Demi you are so precious, I used to sing this song even if I don&#39;t sing well, this song is so inspirational.
Every now and then I’ll listen to music for nostalgia purposes and this brings me back to a time I was so broken and felt like I wouldn’t be able to make it. I wanted to give up and I’m so proud of myself for not giving up on myself. Please take care of yourself and learn to love yourself. I promise it will make such a big difference! 🤍
My worst break up this song describe my abusive relationship ❤️‍🩹💔

We met here
Yes you are Demi
Miss this Demi😢❤
Why this song have so much views??????
This song is really nice, but the funny thing is that this was recommended to me after Swine. I dont even know how this is even the same person, Demi was so beautiful and had such an angelic voice. However, now with her latest release her voice is just filled with anger and I cant even call Swine a song, it&#39;s just shouting and anger. Demi completely changed once she started to believe she was oppressed and is clearly unhappy now. It&#39;s a shame, such a waste of talent.
Who came back to this after the skeet predator catch?
I’m still here 2023❤
Look, I don&#39;t hate demi Lovato or anything and shes a great singer, but she has rlly ler her self go in recent years and has destroyed herself. She used to be so strong. It seems the fame got to her. I mean, just look at her recent Song, the lyrics are vile and it spreads a toxic message. R.I.P Demi Lavato.
In mine opinion this is one of demi best songs, and i wish i or someone else could take all the pain and hurt of the world and cast it out for nowone has to feel pain and hurt ever again 😢
Going this week
I love this this is the best song ever❤❤😍😍🥹🥹😭😭

Utah Salt Flats, Demi Lovato...singing the badass song written by  Kerli. Beautiful 😍 <br><br>Absolutely never gets old.
Cantik ,i like 😊
Demi ❤❤❤❤ Te amooooo!!!
As a recovering addict I can tell you that this song is a sense of strength on bad days. Thank you for being raw and original ❤❤
Melhor parar do que causa confusão como diz o Pierre ficam em paz gente
I remember when i was bullied horrendously by my two roomates during my college days and i would listen to this masterpiece on and on through my earpiece up on the terrace.. this song gave me strength and positivity to go on.. thank you Demi❤
I think she&#39;s brilliant,she writes down what she feels,then makes it a song.Then put her heart into her song.Showing her viewers that were all human,and we go through the storms of life.And she&#39;s brave.courages.strong.Truthful.
demi wanna leafe;&#39;

Eu me lembro nessa época quando a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23eliana">#eliana</a> entrevistou a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23demilovato">#demilovato</a> foi simplesmente surreal ❤
it&#39;s already 2023, and we&#39;re still listening this song
Dear stranger reading this. I don&#39;t know you but I know no matter how bad it feels right now, it will get better. the sun will rise and there will be another day where you don&#39;t feel the way you do right now. Making it through the pain you feel now will be worth those good moments ahead of you. Don&#39;t you give up on yourself, I believe in you and even though I don&#39;t know who you are, I love you.
Everybody listening??🍏🌜🌂🧊😎🌚
Alguém assistindo??❄☃️🐬🌚🛸
Still kicking with listening this song daily for 10 years, it needs a remake !
Founded here after reading the book Stay Strong
I love this song just the other day I was singing this and writing down the lyrics in class
Kalo inget ini inget demi SM Joe Jonas dulu
Essa música é bem feita demais. A voz da Demi tem as lagrimas, ela canta como se estivesse sufocada. Que artista!
Ex thank you for the pain you makes me wiser and more stronger more than you ever know. Goodbye😊

Go run run ......is  the &quot;finish him&quot; part ....
i dont search for old memory<br>i search for old song
I&#39;m so proud of how far Demi has come since releasing this song
Gara gara Cakra khan gue nyapek sini 😁
Perfeita &lt;3
❤ Perfect song for anyone in a controlling narcissistic one sided love relationship
Whenever am broken,this song reminds me of myself worth 😔
this song will always lets me remember how strong i was during this point in time. i was like demi (one year younger), and going through things that i shouldn&#39;t go through that young. but like she did, i preserve and stayed strong. it is still hard now, but light will always be at the end of the tunnel.
2023 still listening to this masterpiece
Demi is a my favorite singer! God bless you
Demi, this is one of your great songs. I&#39;ve enjoyed it ever since I was 17, and I still enjoy it at 29. And, this songs really beautiful to me, you go, girl!

I wish to dedicate miss lavato&#39;s skyscraper song to all the little people out there who have been abused and for those who continue to get abused like you&#39;re nothing.

I know this is a song demi wrote during her eating disorder and im so thankful for this song. I&#39;ve had a binge eating disorder all my life. The worst of it was this year. I decided I needed to focus on recovery from it. Im 2 weeks binge free and emotionally eating free. This song was listened to on repeat so much so many days. If anyone else is reading this in a similar situation with an eating disorder. Healing is possible. You got this you can do this.  Never ever believe you are less than. You have more strength than you think you do.❤❤❤
&quot;Like we never had a chance...&quot; See christian tattoo on her hand. Yep, you dont have a chance when you believe that horseshit demi.

💦🦋💦🦋💦🦋
Everybody listening??🌈💘☔💜😎🌏
I love Demi when she is on this stage, also with &#39;give your heart a break.&#39; I hope you bring back the kind, simpler and much humbler you Demi Lovato. I miss this strong yet a pinch of modesty in you.
2023 + this song still makes me cry
This is hands down her best song 😮‍💨
After 12 years of watching this video a bunch, googling where the gorgeous filming location this is so I can go there, I finally got to the other day! Bonneville salt flats have been on my list ever since then, so happy I crossed that off, and it was just as stunning in real life!
No les pasa que en el minuto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_8ydghbGSg&amp;t=186">3:06</a> les dan ganas de abrazarla 😢
still love this song
This song always makes me feel better
Yes hello 2023 ❤❤❤

I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this song right now
💜🍀
Thank you skeeter jean for bringing me here
Did not understand then at 13...I now understand 🥺💔..this will forever be my song
I only like this version of demi lovato... not the now version of her...
I didn&#39;t searched for this💀
Uma grande cantora a demi ela sempre será a maior
I love demi
lagu enak di dengar
Ancora fa male
Ancora fa male
Ancora fa male
Whatever happened, stay strong girl.😢
Who&#39;s here about hearing about her drug relapse ? Good for her that she&#39;s clean now
Hai girl,, 😘
💗💗💗
This was my first relatable and fav song as a teenager. It articulated in my mind what I couldn&#39;t ❤
2023 anyone??
I miss old Demi 😢
I heard this song when I was  younger and still love it.
The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕❤
This song feels like a hug from my childhood
a pedo sent me here
I will always come back to this song when I need to remember who I am. Just because all you could manage is a two-story duplex, doesn&#39;t mean I have to forget that I wear a crown.
Demi? Rock version of this plssss🥺❤️
so perfecct so superior now!
Dengerin lagunya demi yang ini setelah baca kasusnya ditwitter rasanya seperti demi nyeritain apa yang dialami....semangat ya demi🥲
te bisa bhsa inggris
This song always gets me through tough times thank you so much  demi ❤️
Tremendo himno nos dió Demi. Merecía ser un éxito a nivel mundial, como el que tuvo Sorry not sorry o heart attack.
Love your mucit
If i only could say this to her straight to her face
2023 anyone?

There a pill for you Prozac
Demi I&#39;m glad we connected for eurovision
Almost April 2023 <br>Still a masterpiece
I watch a guy singing this awfully to Demi
i used to reach the high notes of this song:(
Before the nose job
Que obra ,mais  que linda sou apaixonada pela música  e vendo agora o clipe  amei
A lot of people say that Demi Lovato is looking uglier each year, but she is gorgeous in my opinion, her heart is warm and kind, and she has better talent. Those people are just jealous because they can&#39;t do the same thing and can&#39;t hit high notes like her. Some people are trying to make her angry and swear or saying something bad and ruining her reputation without knowing. But she is so powerful, no one can destroy her...
I love this song Demi. I’ve heard it so many times and I love it I can relate
Skeeter Jean
It&#39;s 2023 march who are listening to this masterpiece... Realy hit it me..
Even 6 I been singing this song and now I now all the words ❤❤ this song helped me
❤❤❤❤❤
la plus belle chanson. . .
Anyone else here from Skeeter&#39;s video?
I&#39;m so glad I discovered Demi
I wish more people knew about Demi Lovato because Demi is a warrior.
&quot; would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed &quot; as a self harmer that just hits different
🤍🤍🤍, ❤️❤️❤️, 🖤🖤🖤

Why does this hit so hard
My ex boyfriend think to me is a robot that have no sensitivity and feelings, he always blaming me and etc. I feel offended by his words to say but I think he&#39;s not sensitive to say it to me. It&#39;s unhuman🙂
11 years passed and here I am again💕💕

Demi<br>100%good lyrics<br>100%pure talent<br>100%happy
I like these 11 years ago songs .. simple but so much meaning
2023 March 11 I&#39;m listening to this song going through alot. My bf of 7Years cheat on me and I caught him red handed, he bit me and told me he doesn&#39;t love me anymore. Everything I did for him was my choice he didn&#39;t force me. And left me💔💔💔😓<br><br>But I would rise up like a sky scryaper

This is the definitive version,  the one I just love..❤
The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Thought You Should Know” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️

Years later and this song randomly came to mind.
as a student this song motivates me to much and I will listen to it all the time in my life.
I’m here again.  It’s 2023 😢😢😢😢
What does a desert have to do with a skyscraper?<br>Great song, but it&#39;s a terrible video.
Originally written and recorded by Kerli
The most metaphorically sound song ever written. Hands down. Case closed.
Deam, this hits hard!
💛GOD💖
This song has given me strength to keep on going when life feels so dark until I reach where I feel okay.
This song is amazing... But the version from Sam Bailey just hits different... Both masterpieces...
Still part of the search in 2023
I know you won&#39;t see this, but I want to say that I love you. Your music has that unique special vibe.
Ouch

🥹🥹 This song
camp rock
When this song came out I was getting bullied by my classmates so this song would give me strength. Proud of how far I came. Now when  I hear this song, I wish that time travelling was real so that I could tell my younger-self that it’s going to be ok.
Đây là bài hát hay nhất mọi thời đại luôn quá tuyệt vời 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
I would LOVE to discuss how she was feeling during the recording of this video.  It seems as if there was a lot of thinking about the &quot;visuals&quot; of the video and I wonder what, if any, her input was in the scheme/message of the video.
Beautiful love you Queen  this song reminds me of everything in my life that i had to overcome no matter what I picked myself up and made it
Who wrote the song...rettie
this song literally disappeared from my brain and I JUST remembered it now, oh my goodness
Vs
I don&#39;t know where my marriage is heading but God knows I&#39;ve put in my all😥
