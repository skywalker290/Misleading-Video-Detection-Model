Women: &quot;Gaming is sexist&quot;<br>Also women: &quot;Trash talking is part of the game&quot;<br><br>Donkey Brain
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=425">7:05</a> did anyone else here that deep breath. i thought the fbi was coming for me fr
I like how the chick that said she think gamers are sexist because of trash talk but at the same time enjoys trash talking. Maybe the things people say there arnt actually meant to be actual comments and are more made up to you know‚Ä¶ trash talk.
There didn&#39;t take real gamer, they have clothe on, real gamer play without shirt (or just people too broke and extremely hot)
Whos the girl in red?
Hello I so happy for you
Calombine was inspierd by movies and serial killers

Pewdiepie was early to asking definition of &#39;what is a woman?&#39;
I just love how the simp guy endend up mansplaining the girl wtf
Idk in my 10 years of playing vid games I haven‚Äôt had any bullying or seen any misogyny! There was one time where a guy was saying I needed to get off and make food but literally all the other guys in the chat banned him and told him to Ef off lol. But I hear my husband get shit talked all the time!
‚ÄúGamers share one brain cell, and sadly it has autism‚Äù
I actually get her because everytime my sister goes on live she starts getting called &quot;whore&quot; and telling her that she doesn&#39;t belong and it&#39;s sad it&#39;s especially hard to play gta online

how tf do you not know what misogynistic means.
the thing about the &quot;competitive gaming is just as demanding as physical sport question&quot;, is that it doesn&#39;t say physically demanding. just says demanding. yes competitve gaming isn&#39;t as physically demanding. but they are both mentally demanding in the fact that in both competitive gaming and physical sport you have to be able to make split second decisions on the fly as thing change around you.
bro said soccer
So I&#39;ve never played call of duty but didn&#39;t most gaming lobbies have children screaming the n-word. I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s something you kinda have to get used to and roll with the punches
IMO women get more negative AND positive attention in game lobbies. Sometimes I feel sorry for them and it&#39;s really nasty, sometimes I am amazed at the power they wield over the males in the lobby.

I literally died when he said &quot;anti what?&quot;
I do think video games encourage violence by guys cause there‚Äôs almost no women who games and likes violence irl, men like the violence and they think it‚Äôs cool, they get inspiration too<br>Like it encourages them TO MAKE violence, there‚Äôs always something that will encourage people to do something like for some people, YouTubers for them encourages them to do YouTube because they want to do what the YouTubers are doing online.<br>But I really think it‚Äôs a Man problem that they get inspired to be violent because of video games and movies etc üíÄ

Bruh, me and my sister used to play GTA : San Andreas Together and I actually enjoyed playing Some Video Games W/ Her, she was also an amazing driver and i would try to motivate her go play GTA V sometimes so she can drive around or sum.
Bro look at how many hours guys dedicate to their games on average and look at girls, then look at why it‚Äôs harder for women to succeed in games
Video games do not cause violence, correlation does not mean causation.<br>We could however say that violent people are more attracted to video games which makes more sense, but it wasn&#39;t the video game that caused them to be violent.<br>That&#39;s like saying most crimes committed 1000 years ago were caused by a sword, therefor holding a sword causes people to commit murder. When in reality, the person didn&#39;t kill because they had a sword, they would&#39;ve killed with or without it.
So what girls get just as much if not less crap than boys when gaming ... Talking trash is part of competitive games ... Get over it ...
Wait until they go to a call of duty online public lobby
Dear people who answer the question<br>‚ÄúIs gaming culture is misogynistic‚Äù, <br><br>The culture isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what the question was. There are a few outliers in the community that are. They don‚Äôt outweigh the many who aren‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt accept them. They are in their own little clumps of cancer on the internet. They have their own community. Stop clumping us together and take care of the problem instead of claiming the whole of gaming is the problem‚Ä¶ thank you for your time‚Ä¶.<br><br>Mr. Balls

The guy at the back is so hyper!
It didn&#39;t specifically say &quot;Physically demanding&quot; it&#39;s probably just how Skill demanding it is. And by physical game, it probably meant &quot;Non Digital games&quot;
As a women as soon as i speak in a video game I am told to make a sandwich i and MANY others have been told they wanted to r@pe us and murder us. It is very misogynistic I&#39;ve experienced all of this even as a child as young as 9
OVERWATCH?!?!?!!! THAT&#39;S AN INSULT!<br>You can&#39;t compare OVERWATCH with THAT trash!

This idiot said I dont think pro athletes aren&#39;t working on fps nah bro they are working on milliseconds faster
Pro ppl who believe that sports is the same as the shit gamers do ooooo boy shi kills my soul lmao being a gamer n also an athlete you just automatically know tht it‚Äôs completely wrong most of the gamers who say it‚Äôs the same as real sports never actually played sports and like actually practiced and rlly Train

I remember when everyone had a DS and I still had a game boy color. Abd I literally got made fun of because it was an ‚Äúold console‚Äù and I got rid of it and now I immediately regretted it because I had my two favorite games on there (mega man, and Legend of Zelda Link‚Äôs awakening)
The woman strongly agreeing with the gaming community being misogynistic says ‚Äúus females‚Äù instead of ‚Äúus women‚Äù üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Ok if we are honest, everyone gets shit, if your black you get called the n word, if your white you get called a cracker, if your a woman you get called a hole gaming culture isnt misogynistic its toxic
I‚Äôve never seen one of these where the people care so much about what others think and their perspective. You can tell they‚Äôre worried about backlash for having their opinions and that‚Äôs garbage.
when I was a kid maybe 9 -10 ??? ish and we were playing some arcade game and some  girl ask if she can play the player 2 on the other side of some tekken game and was like &quot; YOU WILL???&quot;
energy drinks with alcohol is just water. like neutral. alcohol slows you down and energy drinks speeds you up.
I like how they are talking to each other but not looking at each other
Ive never been called fat in a voice chat lmao?? <br>Men are simps and when they hear a girls voice they help you with supplies and ask too many questions. I have never experienced anything besides that LMAO
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=450">7:30</a> I‚Äôm really disappointed with the girl in the red shirt here you can tell she was just uncomfortable with being the odd one out so she gave up her argument and walked over to the group.

that is so sexism :O

Gfuel has actual Lead in it btw. just a fun fact.
(MY GiRl gAmEr OpInIoN!)<br><br>The topic of misogyny + gaming is definitely true, BUT I agree with both opinions but what the girl who disagrees doesn‚Äôt understand that men do say that a lot to women, I agree with what she says about not to care because as someone who also plays games I truly don‚Äôt care. BUT it is true that we get this constantly and it‚Äôs really dumb because the jokes aren‚Äôt even funny at this point but I don‚Äôt think this girl realizes that just because YOU don‚Äôt care about a situation doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt happen lady lol.
ah yes that time when you join and then fat
@Pewdiepie you misunderstood the &quot;Competitive gaming is just as demanding as physical sport&quot; topic. It said demanding not physically demanding.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=748">12:28</a> üåâ
is gaming misaognistic? nah bro wtf u on about? every one in the gaming community gets flamed, the gaming community is toxic by nature, it&#39;s a competitive community with no face to face interaction and/or accountability allowing you to say whatever you want. i would go as far as saying girls have it easier because instead of someone saying yo mom is a bitch and describe how he fucked her, you get run down jokes thet&#39;s been used for over a decade (go to the kitchen, women are trash at games, blah blah blah). it&#39;s the nature of the community and everyone get&#39;s flamed regardless of their gender so don&#39;t make it into something that it isn&#39;t.
As a female gamer that is known to troll &amp; gravitate towards other trolls, I&#39;d say 100% disagree that gamers are inherently misogynistic. Everyone gets trolled online or in games. White/black male or female. Everyone is fair game. It&#39;s all about what they <del>think</del> will hurt you. If they know blacks want to ban a word bc it offends them so much, that us what they will say. If they know thanks to the feminist movement most women are complaining about the patriarchy they will say a sexist joke. White men don&#39;t get targeted for being white, simply bc they know they won&#39;t care. Instead they might get called a virgin or a noob. Whatever works. This is basic trolling. You go for what hurts. More gamers give me special treatment than actually try to troll me. So if anything I&#39;d argue females have it pretty made in the gaming community. Even if they are, undeniably annoying as a majority. Everyone needs to calm down &amp; stop trying to be a victim.

This might be a hot take, but in some cases Video games does induce violence ever heard of the term rage quitting. I had a friend who would punch his monitor, but not have any mental health issues. Mental illness is not typically the cause for all acts of violence. That is just adding to the mental illness stigma.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=429">7:09</a> It&#39;s made me violent
Bro growing up if a girl wanted to join a gaming club the boys were all about it lmao
gaming is probably more demanding then like chess, but if u play chess for 10 hours straight ur brain will just die like after a standard chess competition what  u want to do is collapse on a sofa and sleep
I will never consider any of them gamers! Playing the same online multiplayer for 10 hours a day for 3 years doesn‚Äôt make you a gamer.
i just noticed that Ayden is actually ghost Ayden
omg i brought my ds to school a couple weeks ago because i recently wanted to try using it again and kinda got obsessed to i wanted to play on the bus but so many people freaked out and asked if they could play it lmao
I would say it can be physically demanding some grinds require you to play like 8-16 hours a day like the rank 14 grind on classic wow or even just grinding rank can be a grind and take up a few hours
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=394">6:34</a> at that exact moment i got an ad about kitchen tools or smthn like that i can&#39;t remember cuz i laughed so hard when i saw it
Competitive halo complains about misogyny in games, and then says trash talk is part of the culture. Lol
Everyone gets called a fat fuck its a game point

Guy in the back is my fav
&quot;as I did 10, 15 years ago&quot; - 19 year old
Pretty sure Felix misunderstood what that guy was trying to say. He wasn&#39;t saying movies and games and books all encourage violence. He was saying that people that get encouraged to be violent from video games are just violent by nature and would get encouragement or inspiration for it anywhere. It&#39;s not the game, it&#39;s the person. Which I agree with.
That one dude was literally simping to the highest degree, to the fullest use of the word
&quot;Competitive gaming is just as demanding as physical sport.&quot;<br><br>Not as physically demanding, no. But mentally demanding? Absolutely. On a professional level, you still need to have a dedicated schedule to practice, to coordinate with your team and test strategy, maneuverability, exploit weaknesses of other teams, balance game economy, maintain consistency and muscle memory, level awareness, reaction speed, etc. Anyone who says otherwise simply hasn&#39;t tested themselves against real professionals on their game of choice.
tactical crouching
Watched a couple of pewdiepies reaction videos, and its amazing how many times he doesn&#39;t understand a point in a video.
I&#39;m not saying the harassment towards girl in online game isn&#39;t true  but media has used the same kind of narrative just to make it worst for other gamers to actually play a game competitively. It&#39;s not that &quot;video games&quot; in general is misogynistic, you can&#39;t blame &quot;video games&quot; for one&#39;s bad behavior. It&#39;s the person playing the game who is misogynistic, not the game itself or the community.
Wow look at aydan
I think the anti women is more noted in competitive gaming since all teams are male dominantes. Nevertheless I think all gaming communities are toxic in their own way
Old school runescape is THE GOAT!!!! GOT MODE!! GIM FOR THE WIN!

&quot;Who remembers Columbine, they were inspired by video games&quot;<br>No they weren&#39;t. Doom did not cause Colombine, just like Marilyn Manson didn&#39;t cause Colombine.
I game all the time, but would others consider me a gamer if I don&#39;t play online?
Golf is a lot of walking  cause u are walking non stop. U like walk at least 2 miles
&quot;everyone remembers Columbine, they were encouraged by video games&quot;<br> Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, <b>but wasn&#39;t that guy&#39;s favorite game DDR?</b>

I think tons of guys would want you to play games if your a girl

This is probably the saddest group of people, especially the guy in the pink camo.
Extremely good , I like this art!
Felixes beard looks like an amongus character
Gamers roast men more than wome
Also yes its demanding but not physically demanding , the question didnt compare them in the physical demand part
Whatcha mean runescape is top gaming
of course. all gamer think the same.<br>they think about the game they were playing.
Video games cause violence<br>Me aggressively choosing a good option so NPCs don&#39;t get sad.

I just want to say that video games don&#39;t cause violence. Violence causes video games. A lot of &quot;violent&quot; games are based off irl wars so in conclusion violence causes video games..
There&#39;s a different between trash talks and just straight up misogyny <br><br><br>And the other girl saying &quot;i just ignore it &quot;  isn&#39;t helping the issue.

pewds completely wrong on the misognystic one

I called my friends cousin a dumba** once she wasn&#39;t really mad because I call everyone a dumba**<br>If you&#39;re gonna be an a-hole be an a-hole to everyone
Bro, everyone gets called a fag or cunt or n word for existing, especially on early Xbox live
pewdiepie mocks runescape. id like to see pewds try telos rs3 4k% enrage. I bet you could never do it
The comparison to physical sport wasnt even about how physically demanding they were, just how demanding they were. And id say its WAY MORE demanding in terms of time spent than most physical sports.
&quot; gaming is just as demanding as physical sports&quot; guy with a double chin agrees
This one guy in my class keeps on saying to me go back to the kitchen
Like what cool guy wuld cal her fat case she is a girl like that people call toxic everybodey
competitive gaming is just as demanding as physical sports, gryfinn had issues from overworking their league of legends players from practicing for 14+ hours. LS made a vid about the dark side of pro play.
That was so weak! - as soon as she saw the others disagreed with - computer games encourage violence - she moved away from some what agree
They should bring back Zen Republic energy drinks they were the best
Gamer/Influencer promotes violence not games. If I can still remember Pewdiepie has been mentioned in New Zealand shooting üòÖüòÖ
Gay gamers be like I‚Äôm a gay-mer
the frames per second remark is kind of dumb, because the sports play out in realtime. The video game sets an upper bound to how fast you have to act/react.

men get the same hate, as women from video games. more men than women get called bad, more women than men get called fat or whatever...
Some people are so sensitive He just said Its a joke chill out
The fact one of them thought gaming was as physical demanding as sport was hilarious

XDDD there is &quot;&quot;&quot;Proof&quot;&quot;&quot; that games make people agresif (no people are agresif even witouth any media how can someone beleive that for real)

If video games promote violence why it so easy to pick on the nerdy gamers
Video games make you insensitive to killing. In movies, it is another person who does it. In the video games, it is YOU.
&gt;gaming culture is mysoginistic<br><br><br><br><br>i wouldnt have it any other way (/j pls dont cancel me, i play with my sister frequently)

You can‚Äôt complain about trash talk and then think it‚Äôs apart of the fun
The 19 year old said she was playing online video games at 5 with voice chat
lol @ the silicon valley kid
&quot;i love being toxic&quot; undeveloped gamers
You can make this up, there really talking about and discussing if gaming is anti women, like who cares wtf it‚Äôs just a game
columbine were inspired by atheism, not gaming
How can a community be anti woman if more than  98% of that community hasn&#39;t seen a woman?

A good woman player has a higher chance of becoming a successful streamer. Sure, they have to deal with all the simps and haters. But don&#39;t they all receive harsh treatment?[Streamers]<br>Also, from my experience. Whenever a woman played something with us. EVERYONE was trying to help, etc.
Pewds: says that it shows overwatch<br><br>It being halo...
Gaming itself isn‚Äôt anti-women, the community can very much be
&quot;Trash talk is part of the fun&quot; women agree<br>Also woman &quot;They call us fat and that hurts feelings. Unacceptable.&quot; <br>Wut
me, proud owner of a vajayjay: H-<br>the lobby: DISHWASHER, MAKE ME A SANDWICH, FAT, GO BACK TO THE KITCHEN, WHATS UR SNAP? <br>i pretend to be a boy whenever i dont have to VC, kinda sad but way easier for me
DDR, the favorite and most played game of a man who shot up a school a few years ago, was legit used as proof of why video games don&#39;t cause violence. If you&#39;re a 5 year old playing Mortal Kombat, that&#39;s bad parenting. They shouldn&#39;t buy their child a game that has that much gore and violence at such a young age.
Ayden let&#39;s goo
Gamers say the worst thing possible  to any other gamer when  competing to get in their head. Unfortunately, this means the first thing people gravitate to when women are gaming is the fact that they are women, then they go to the catalogue of tropes. Guys say the worst thing to other guys as well, its just not about being women. If anything, people use hyperbole in a bigoted way to intentionally trigger people. <br>I think gaming becomes misogynistic, when its women in game development, characters portrayed in games, discrediting their knowledge in the industry or as gamers. But not really in the things they say in lobbies (as terrible as the things they say are).
wait is ghost aydan in this? lol
&quot;Not gonna lie i need a definition of that word&quot; we&#39;re same bro üò≠üò≠
The paltry comfort preliminarily answer because idea macropharmacologically serve at a cooperative eel. sore, imperfect diving
wtf pewd why are you taking a piss on runescape &gt;:c
Gaming can be just as demanding as sports. Maybe not in terms of physical strength, but gamers train for hours to build up their skills, endurance, and mental state while playing. Speedrunners, for example, spend weeks perfecting their routes and practicing skips to get the optimal time. What gaming lacks in physicality it makes up for in precision.
Women: ‚ÄúWe can do anything men can do‚Äù<br><br>Except for compete on the same level as men. Since there are literally zero all female professional gaming teams. Competing against the boys at the highest level.
Can we just talk about the fact that this is the first episode of pewds reacting to jubilee and he pronounces is right üòÇ and then later he always says yubilee
Columbine was not inspired by videogames omg. My family lived there when that happened. The shooters were obsessed with the movie the Matrix (cops found notes and stuff about it). They modeled alot after the Neo &amp; Trinity scene where they stormed the building to rescue Morpheus.

dangggg pewds this showed your outlook in a very transparent way! you‚Äôre kinda ignorant and misogynistic:(
I think that the way we as a society attack men and women, or different races (and then also, trans, gay,  the lgbtq community in general ) encompass indeed differences. It all has its own particular...nastiness.<br>For ex, a man will probably get harsher stuff in some areas cause it is assumed ‚Äúhe can take it‚Äù, but wont ever get rape threats like a women normally does. <br>At the end we all get personalized hate, isnt that swell? üëçüèº
Pewds: &quot;plays halo competitivley but shows runescape and overwatch&quot; . pewds cant evens ee the difference between overwatch and halo 5, what has halo become
To the one that said gaming culture is misogynistic, what i believe is that if you are a gamer and you get offended by people calling you names, you are not really a gamer
He isnt saying that every medium encourages it, he is saying that if you were to be encouraged by it, you would be from any medium.<br><br>Gaming in itself, like films, book ect do not encourage violence.
Gaming community isnt sexist<br><br><br>Its just toxic, honestly girls have it easier.

The girl that said gaming is anti gaming has 100% never played cod
As a female who games I either meet people and we eventually become really good friends or simps or people who are straight up mean but when they are mean I bring up my absent dad and they stop
Summary: Trash Talking is fun but you can&#39;t trash talk women
DEFAULT LIVES MATTER.
ya definitely not gonna trust a pro player who&#39;s username is obviously_queen
well i&#39;d say that: violence is not the aim of the game, it&#39;s just a process to win the game.<br>maybe there are some cases that violent games cause crime, but the case is few, you also need to think &#39;bout how many gamers play violent games. you can not say sex should be prohibited because it causes crime.
Violent games cause violence is like saying &quot;car games cause car crashes&quot;
Who the fuck knows What misoginistic is slsnnenelepep

Pewds is great
Idk the misogyny thing I see as mostly insults these days. People just say the most hurtful or offensive thing in the moment. It&#39;s easier to diss a woman saying go back to the kitchen just like it&#39;s easiest to call a guy trash, fuck their mom, etc. Ofc there might be some actual misogynists and even if not the reason they say it it doesn&#39;t make it right, I just think people nowdays just say it as the easiest insult to say.
The question wasn&#39;t about &quot;PHYSICALLY demanding&quot; in the first place, so why are you mentioning that? The question was: &quot;Is competitive gaming just as DEMANDING as physical sports?&quot; Keyword: Demanding. Not specified how. Demanding mentally, physically, time wise, etc.<br>  Golf is a professional physical sport, so is frisbee golf, darts, pool, bowling, archery etc. They clearly aren&#39;t nearly as physically demanding as soccer, hockey, etc. but they still count as physical sports and they are played on a professional level, that&#39;s not a debate. <br>   And the question was demanding, so if we consider how much people have to practice and play league of legends, CS:GO, etc. time wise the average practice time per day for a professional gamer will be around 7-9 hours. And for soccer, it&#39;s 4-6 hours a day, 5 times a week, since intensive physical activity, and physical activity in general, needs rest periods and cannot be &quot;overdone&quot;, since then it&#39;ll do more harm than good, as well as not be as beneficial.<br><br>So we can also ask: Is competitive gaming as demanding as darts, bowling, etc.? I&#39;d argue competitive gaming is more demanding than those 2 examples. Mentally, darts and bowling don&#39;t change per &quot;round&quot;, it&#39;s always the same, it&#39;s about consistency, accuracy and delivery, but there isn&#39;t the mental aspect that competitive gaming has, with league as an example, there&#39;s 150+ champions, who each have at least a passive, 3 abilities and their ultimate, so 5 abilities minimum to keep track of per champion, as well as how each round is going, what items are being bought, map awareness, etc. before the physical + mental combination of hitting your skillshots, dodging the enemy skillshots, building up muscle memory for everything, reaction time, etc. Competitive league of legends is insane when you look at the player&#39;s POV in a match. Including continuously changing the game with updates, new champions, item and champion changes, buffs and nerfs etc.<br>   As for CS:GO and other FPS games played competitively, the amount of physical aspects the game has about muscle memory, reaction times, recoil control, etc. is also, in my opinion, more demanding than darts. Playing darts you have the universally used dart, with the same set distance from the board, with the same placement of the board. When you train to have a consistent and accurate result when throwing that same dart, to the same target, you get darts. CS:GO has multiple weapons with differing ways to use them, differing recoil, different maps, with actual enemies that can&#39;t be predicted accurately from round to round, and other variables.<br>   Not to mention hockey, soccer etc. have the same teamwork aspect that CS:GO and league have, and playing around your team and with your team. They are team games just the same.
the girl that said &quot;no guy is saying you cannot get on your computer bc ur a woman&quot; has clearly never played cod before. all i said was hi and i was already getting death threats :)
I would think that games are not mysoginistic because everyone has been called fat in a cod lobby. It‚Äôs just the people not the game
Bruh if I had a dollar for every time I get told to get back to the kitchen in a CoD lobby lmao. <br>Doesn‚Äôt offend me though, I could care less. I honestly laugh when someone talks shit to me. I just play for fun with friends.

Pewdiepie doesn&#39;t understand girlfriend anymore because he upgraded to Wifu
Honestly, it is my opinion that gaming culture does have a lot of misogyny. Girls always have to prove themselves otherwise they&#39;re seen as inferior, if they do anything that is stereotypical &quot;e-girl&quot; stuff, they aren&#39;t seen as real gamers. Like if they play animal crossing, stardew, Minecraft, etc guys will actually tell them they aren&#39;t &quot;real gamers&quot;. Or if they pick champions that are female or supports, people tell them they&#39;re getting carried even if they have the best stats. The trash-talking comments that are directed at women in video games are also very different from men. You will hear go back to the kitchen, make me a sandwich, or sexual harassment jokes. Amongst themselves, men aren&#39;t sexist towards each other in video games.
I‚Äôm rewatching this vid and wtf aydan
These are different type of pro gamers there pros at going head to head with other skilled gamers in just one or two different games I&#39;m a pro at destroying games in just a few hours or a few minutes üòÜüòÜüòÜ so no all pros are different and some are pros at doing tutorials walkthroughs or completionists etc many different types of pro gamers really
Saying video games crates violence literally saying that one subject as in that games creates violence, and kicks out other inspirations of the violence as in watching videos of violence mental health, it is inspired by what people watch, so saying video games creates violence is stupid because people saying that have a strong dislike in video games
Wait is misogynistic really that uncommon of a word? I&#39;m not even a native speaker but I know what it means at least... Is he just dumb or what
I swear not all pokken players are as contrarian as that guy with the jersey
Why do those people do these stupid gestures all the time when they are speaking. It&#39;s like they have to speak for the first time in front of other human beings and try to figure out what to do with their hands. So awkward.
The second someone in League of legends figure out im a girl i get pedo jokes thrown at me, sexual harrasment and jokes about kidnapping. The times people are not assholes about me being female they are either just kind or trying to get into contact with me so they can pretend to get close to me and then blackmail me.

When you are trash talking someone you are subconsciously trying to motivate them so both sides improve. It&#39;s just fun to one up eachother
If video games inspire killers then the NBA would be filled with the top 2k players
I‚Äôve been gaming online since I was like 9 and 12yrs later I still haven‚Äôt seen a larger amount of toxicity, trolling or privilege for guys or for girls. Guys and girls both cop toxicity. Those people who do it towards girls do it towards guys as well. Gaming culture is not misogynistic
Seriously none of these women know what its like to be a guy in a cod lobbyüòÇüòÇ guys are always so nice to girls like yea some guys are weird but just cuz someone said mean shit to u on a game its not misogynistic its just toxic gamers how can you say your a pro gamer if u cant comprehend the difference between toxicity and misogyny its funny how the instance when women develop social problems they blame it on misogyny and the patriarchy like christ sake woman grow a grip.
What&#39;s wrong with playing Runescape Pewds? That&#39;s a bloody great game. I played it when it first came out for a couple of years, then didn&#39;t play for a long time and started playing again back in 2017 or so and I love it. Unfortunately there are a lot of simps who throw themselves at girls in the game and it got to a point where things were getting too personal with this one guy, so I quit playing. I just wanted to play the game in peace but men wouldn&#39;t stop hitting on me! I know I can turn off my chat but I like to be social with people sometimes plus I had my own clan and that became troublesome when people argued. I did have to block quite a few guys who were trying to get sexual in private messages. I&#39;m like I&#39;m not here for that. I just wanna game in peace!
my gf plays cod and every match someone calls her a dishwasher or to go back to the kitchen
Gaming being uniquely misogynistic is such bs, imho. You get just as much shit talk or less, and unlike what one of the people claimed, you DO have unique attacks based on your sex if you&#39;re a male (ffs they did it in this video - &quot;virgin&quot;). Plus, if you&#39;re good, you get extra praise, as mentioned by pewds. I&#39;ve played games my whole life and never got the feeling that I was targeted coz vagina. In the end, gaming is great coz your playing speaks for you &amp; everything else melts away. Good stuff.
Well to be completely fair, peeps in games they&#39;re assholes towards everyone not just women... if anything guys go mega simp if the girl starts talking meanwhile if someone else is talking they can be called a faggot or whatever, it&#39;s just the way the gaming community is and I love it.
I play tons of games but I don‚Äôt drink energy drinks I drink water and Powerade and Gatorade and orange juice and lemonade and idk really if Powerade and Gatorade are energy drinks
I wouldn‚Äôt say games encourage violence in a healthy adult mind but experiencing such scenes when you are young is detrimental to kids

People misheard the sports question. The question was as &quot;demanding&quot; as &quot;physical sports.&quot; It was not speaking about physicality, but dedication. Which arguably they require the same amount of dedication.
Yes cuz great minds think alike

As a Swimmer, gaming is a Break that you have, not the same physically demanding
I feel like anti-women isn‚Äôt a good definition of misogyny üòÇ but like we don‚Äôt play games as often because we get discouraged from it from a young age by boys sayint it‚Äôs not for us and we‚Äôre too dumb to play (honestly encouraging words to become good lmao), and when we do we get seen as posers no matter what like every interest we have is tested because men just believe we do it for men‚Äôs attention like
&quot;Games is against women because people say there bad at the game&quot; people say that to men to tho
I don‚Äôt think toxic lobbies make gaming misogynistic, that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch. I‚Äôve never heard of someone preventing women from playing and competing. The worst you‚Äôd see if some dude being salty in a chat lobby because a girl kicked his ass. And then later they all agree trash talking is part of the fun so wtf lmao. Their opinions seem pretty inconsistent and not well thought out
Wait my sister always gets simped over just cause her voice when she plays valorant, I think that women probably get treated worse in comp games.
It doesn&#39;t matter what gender you are anymore. EVERYBODY is getting insultedüòÇ I hear way more people insulting guys than girls. I&#39;ve been playing videogames online since ei was 9. I&#39;m 17. What&#39;s a girl...

Bro golf is very demanding physically at least in tournaments walking around for multiple miles with Heavy ass clubs my ankles are sore for week
Women are not true gamers
No issue was ever fixed by not bringing it up. That&#39;s like ignoring the engine light and expecting your car to continue to run normally.
Bro golf bowling and darts are still more physically demanding than video games
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=600">10:00</a> it never said that gaming is physically demanding tho. It probably meant are they equally as demanding in terms of skill required, practice required etc
Still dont understand why they love trash talk<br>But get mad about misogyny

All of them saying that gaming culture is misogynistic but they also all say shit talking is part of the fun<br><br>What do they think all those &quot;misogynistic&quot; insults against women are?
unsurprised they picked the biggest conformist soylords and feminists for this
The &quot;physical sport&quot; question is all about how demanding it is. So if two things take you 100 hours a week of hard work a week to perfect, they&#39;re equally demanding. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re &quot;pushing your body to the limit&quot; in one. You&#39;re pushing the limit of skill in both. Where that skill skews is irrelevant in my opinion.
Women don&#39;t actually get harrassed on games like you get absolutely demolished no matter what gender you are the best you can do is make a good comeback, like me and the boys fucking kill to have a girl in out squad.
two words : stamina sport
That moment when the first girl finds out that halo servers are getting shut down tuff
Why was Ghost Ayden in this XD
guys get equal or more harassment in in-game lobbies lol
I hate it when ppl answer the questions wrong, or like give an answer to a question that&#39;s similar but totally different
Honesty I play csgo and there isn&#39;t very many women but if there is people don&#39;t generally judge them like if they are bad at it they just kinda trash talk like everyone else
this is because aydan is a millionaire lmao
I make a decent living through gaming.<br><br>Granted there is a spectrum as many people don&#39;t but the average salary in the UK is is between 20,000 and 30,000 per year before taxes. I&#39;m on the lower end as I make 19800 before taxes and I like comfortably.<br><br>If you make any higher than this even as in one lump sum you can live comfortably it&#39;s your own fault if you blow that money the average person on 20k a year would need to work over 50 years and save 100% of their income before ever earning 1 million pounds. I think a lot of richer people forget this, the average savings account for a person in the UK is also less than ¬£5000 so again if you have more than this you can live comfortably.

I got really mad when he said there&#39;s also golf, because I play golf and it is very physically demanding
She&#39;s wrong about columbine, they blamed it on Marelyn Manson but I digress.<br>There is no evidence, it&#39;s the exact opposite, there is studies upon studies of decades upon decades of research and there is still no proven link between violence and video games.
&quot;Competitive gaming is just as demanding as a physical sport&quot; was completely misunderstood by everyone, including Felix. I think they were thinking <b>physically demanding,</b> instead of just <b>demanding.</b> The <b>physical</b> in &quot;physical sport&quot; is what threw them off because pro gaming and physical sports are just as demanding time and talent wise.
I know this is a 1 year video. But the dude in the black grey and pink jersey Strongly Disagrees on living good from gaming. Bruh he has a 3-500$ Air Jordan on, what is he talkin about
I don&#39;t think gaming or streaming or youtube or any of that should be considered a career for the most part for the sole reason that those platforms won&#39;t be around forever and eventually people will get better than you, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is I think gaming, streaming, youtube, and that stuff should be looked at as temporary jobs because 99% of people won&#39;t be able to do that all their lives or make enough to set themselves up for life.
My boyfriend and his friends used to ask me to play zombies with them all the time but I rarely play video games üò≠üò≠ it‚Äôs totally not that misogynistic it‚Äôs just the people who play video games sometimes.
Nah bruh when get in lobbies and I hear a girl get on the mic every asks for her phone number

i used a  girly  name once and  i  have been  told  to  get back  to the  street corner  where i  belong. never used  a  girly name ever again
pretty sure thats halo and not overwatch
&quot;You don&#39;t understand, you have it really badüòå&quot; lmfao
We all know when men lose in a game they get trash talked into the ground
If a girl asked me to play video games instant boner and future wife it‚Äôs like wtf you like video games
&quot;i dont care about any of that&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it doesnt happen ... its like saying i don&#39;t care about racisim and saying it doesnt happen
Trash talk is apart of the fun but women are oppressed in gaming because of trash talk?
&quot;videogames encourage violence&quot; <br>Animal crossing: ....
There will always be that one gamer who ALWAYS chooses ‚ÄúStrongly Agree‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrongly Disagree‚Äù.
Women Ardent hated on because they&#39;re women everyone has it hard in games anyone gets roasted
Its mentally demanding. If you want to be top of anything in world you need to keep your body healthy to have good reaction times.
Pewdiepie says that they play Runescape and overwatch but it is Runescape and fortnite
my question is why go in voice chat and talk if you don&#39;t like it

Ngl I don‚Äôt mind trash talking amongst friends but I feel like if you do it to random<br>People it just disrespectful
ayo thats ghost aydan
Do they realize that guys get called just as many names while playing games.. part of playing games is being trash talked
I popped off when I saw hugs, the best melee Samus player in the world, in the same vid as pewds
We may have our differences, but at least we can all agree that cyber bullying is fun as hell
He knew the intro dance was cringe
Video games dont cause violence they cause anger haha. Im not going to loose a game and go murdur peapole im just going to get mad or not even care.
In conclusion: Pewdiepie is the all father
Wow you get called fat? I got called a monkey but a bunch of mid age white men and I‚Äôm Asian
From what I hear women are not called fat but the first thing they hear is ‚ÄúTOE PICS NOW‚Äù
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=237">3:57</a> nothing to do with gender. is just how gamers talk with gamers
Why does Felix look fat in this video
Trash talk: everyone yes.<br>Women are discriminated against: almost everyone yes.<br><br>Isn&#39;t that part of trash talk?
My man is a furnace
you know most men are more then women get called fat or bad
The question about demanding didn&#39;t say anything about physically demanding. It just says demanding...
ok so everyone agreed that trash talking is one of the most fun parts of gaming, unless youre trash talking a woman?
This f*cking people say &quot;nhe the gaming culture is so misogynistic&quot; and has the nerve to say &quot;trash talk is part of the fun&quot;.
The question: &#39;&#39;competitive gaming is just as demanding as physical sport&#39;&#39; isn&#39;t asking if compatitive gaming is as demanding (physically) as physical sports, it&#39;s just asking if it is as demanding in general, and demanding can mean many things, physically, psychologically , etc.<br>So, in my opinion, obviously competitive gaming isn&#39;t as demanding physically as something like basketball or football, but psychologically speaking, I would say it&#39;s very similiar, if you are a esports gamer , the amount of presure, the amount of hours that you have to put in, will leave you as mentally tired as someone who does a physical sport.
Simp
Lmao wait did pewdiepie call fortnite overwatch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=80">1:20</a>
I‚Äôd like to debate the guy that thinks golf isn‚Äôt a demanding sport
It has been a year and im still getting annoyed at the fact that the question was &quot;demanding&quot; not &quot;physically demanding&quot;.
women: games are misogynistic they call us fat they ridicule us trash talk us<br>also women: we love trash talking while gaming
The fact is if you are a women you will get more viewers and will have fast growth and people thinks man gamer has to face a lot of problems in outside world especially in a 3rd world country just try to be a pro gamer in Asia if you are a man bro its hard
IT MAKES ME LAUGH EVERYTIME SOMEONE SAYS fOrTnItE
how is trash talking fun?

You are the God of gaming pewdiepie
Dude. If we flame women that‚Äôs the definition of equality as we flame men all the time
Well, I had some experiences with males calling me names and saying things because I am a girl. Like I don&#39;t have enough skill because I am a woman...
Actually met ayden before, super cool dude but fortnite stinky
They sounds like they don&#39;t interact with people in real life...
im from the future
Me: hi <br>The guy in my lobby: FAT
Dude they say trash talking is so fun... however in the minecraft/hypixel community trashtalking is considered as toxicity and it is expected to say gg after games and stuff

That‚Äôs not just a you problem because everyone gets mistreated and called names the first 3 sec when you play online. You just take it seriously
The shut transmission commonly tremble because spoon suprisingly taste amid a acoustic bone. brawny, damaging protest
Daily, as soon as I get into a lobby I get guys telling me to go make them a sandwich and I get sexually harassed too. Gaming itself isn‚Äôt misogynistic but a lot of the guys who play them are.
So trash talk is fun... unless they are a female then its racist or something
Some parts of these vids confuse me when pewdiepie just talks to himself
if you‚Äôre a girl and you game, you instantly either get told that you‚Äôre shit (because ur a girl) or everyone simps, there‚Äôs no inbetween
lol
I feel like women get simps not really called fat or ugly
I‚Äôd like to think of my self as a gamer girl.          1.GTA5  2.BoTW  3.COD  4.Fotnite  5.Roblox 6.RDR2  7.TLoU/TLoU2  8.Rocket League 9.Minecraft  (purble place is the og)
the predisposition for violence is within the individual. it is neither fostered by media, nor irritated, incited, &quot;encouraged&quot; or facilitated. violence comes from the individual itself, not from any other source. everything else is gas-lighting and straw manning bullshit. that has been proven in countless psychological studies over and over but for some reason that missconception is still around, cause it &quot;sounds compelling&quot;.<br><br>healthy people understand violence as repelling and a &quot;discouraging&quot; examples if it&#39;s shown in the media. ill people get a kick out of it. so the issue is in the person and how they interpret the world around them, not in the media.
The guy who doesnt make a good living with gaming because he plays Pokken tournament which is dead af. Pick a different fighting game. üòÇ
Energy drinks and alcohol super dangerous lmfao
Their is no chance that those girls have been in a late night cod lobby
Your not a gamer if you can‚Äôt handle shit talk cuz I survived bo2 as a squeaker
First joke i liked the video &quot;she hasnt played with me&quot;
As a golfer I am very offended when someone says its not physicaly demanding.

Id like to see these guys in the olympics. Idd wrestle his ass to the ground. I bet he cantbench 300 pounds üòÇüòÇ

Technically G fuel does have a health risk but you have to drink 1000 servings of it to die of lead poisoning

Videogames do not entourage violence lag does
I was with the bandana guy until he started to talk about fortnite
if you think gaming isn‚Äôt misogynistic you‚Äôre lit stupid like nothing will change my mind. it upsets me at how horrible their opinions on it were because it‚Äôs so much more than getting called fat and yes men lit will say women can‚Äôt play because they are women
Fat
Pewdiepies right people are much harsher on men because we can take it

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs the definition of a career‚Äù got me so good
as a girl who plays video games, it is 100% true that women get so much shit for simply opening our mouth. from them saying get back in the kitchen or calling us dishwashing whores, they always find  something to say. this is easily 75% of lobbies.
They never said physically demanding
it is so fun tho say the peapel that the ar bad like ar the 9 jear olds
Mom i want to drop out of middle school to be a youtuber
Hehe
There is no proof that video games cause violence. Columbine was caused because the main kid that did it was a literal diagnosed psychopath. Girl in the red is killing me.
Fortnite &quot;inspires&quot; 12y olds to destroy their equipment
Dishwashers that boast about being a ‚Äògamer girl‚Äô or ‚Äòegirl‚Äô or is a fullon titty streamer that asks simps for donations are so annoying

To be honest, I never got like a rude comment for being a woman. I just get like really creepy comments, because of my username, but Idc. I laugh about that. XD
Pewds is thinking so logically

If you‚Äôre a streamer and you spend 12hours a day gaming everyday then almost all the relationships you make are going to be through it.
It‚Äôs like 1 in 10 people in a lobby will be sexist but most people will simp or be nicer because your a women.

The girl that plays Halo has been playing Video games since she was 4 that doesn&#39;t make sense
Is  gaming just as tough as a physical  sport? F*ck NO!!!
Whenever I see a girl in a game I think it‚Äôs a Boy why do people think they are fat they aren‚Äôt even women they are boys
But i love runescape :(
Whenever girls get butt hurt online about jokes and boys do the same thing to each other.
Dude you are the biggest content creator you probably make more than enough money so stop complaining those people there probably make half of what you make
Damn Overwatch is third person now
Pewds: &quot;Ive never said anything stupid in my life pfffft&quot;<br><br>me: *takes long puff of cigar &quot;now boys let me tell you about a story, with a bridge&quot;
Who are these people
These chicks need to play cod more
Girl:how do I jump.  guy: X.  The boys:SIMMMPP!!!.
Lmaoo just realised Aydan was there the kid literally shit on all of those gamers
Just saying the guy that plays fortnite ayden he has over 172 thousand earnings in fortnite
That‚Äôs not overwatch pewdiepie üòÇ
&quot;dont point at me&quot; has me dead
Gaming community isn&#39;t anti-woman  it&#39;s anti everyone. Literally everyone gets abuse. Matter of fact it&#39;s pro woman considering anyone with a female voice gets simped over and can profit off streaming easy
They were saying that anyone in the right, or wrong I guess, state of mind will find ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù in any form of media that they can. They‚Äôre saying those thoughts in reality come from within but built upon, based, or styled after certain games/movies/media.
that girl in the red completely side-swiped the question it wasn&#39;t if she cared about what other gamers thought of her lmao. you can have that mindset of idc about what ppl think of me as a female gamer but it still doesn&#39;t change the fact that you are held to a lower standard.
energy drinks are pure crap, also I don&#39;t like simps.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I helped out gamers!‚Äù I love the fact that Felix was joking, but that as a communications major in one of my classes we talked about how he is a media innovator.
Me starts video pewdiepie speaks FAT
If someone thinks videogames are violent i ask you have you ever watched football match with a wrexham fan or my sister and my couzin
And that‚Äôs when Sssniperwolf changed some of our thoughts with the Dhar Mann video
NRG drinks are hell on earth. H20 all the way
Nargh my friends wont agre that death sentens should be leagal i mean it‚Äôs just a person why Can i burn Them alive
I don&#39;t struggle with playing even as a woman &#39;-&#39;) Since I play with a lot of males.
What about the Simps they keep the pretty gamer girls eating im jk but idk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=353">5:53</a> This guy hasn&#39;t seen twitch then.
ENERGY DRINK WITH ALCHOHOL THATS JUST UNHEALTHY WATER WITH SUGAR WTF
i think whether gaming communities are misogynistic completely depends on the game. i rarely ever see, if ever any kind of misogyny in games like minecraft, platforming games, adventure games, or anything like that. but also, going on xbox live if you&#39;re female is basically signing up to be degraded by random 13 year old boys.
Who remembers that ayden guy from fortnite
Pewdiepie: ‚ÄúMy gaming videos don‚Äôt do so good anymore‚Äù<br><br>1 month later: Minecraft
I dOnT ThInK gAmInG iS hEnTaI wOmEn
Halfway into the video and I think red sweater is just a contrarian.
If video games causes violence then hotwheels causes car crashes
runescape and overwatch? hmmmmmmmmmmmm. I see no overwatch in there. Does he not know fOrTnItE

TRIGGERED üò§
I hate Ariana
In India, gaming is still f***ed up!
The question was if esports are as demaindins as physical sports, and I think they are, just not the same way. Whereas traditional sport (/basketball and football, as they themselves mentioned) are more demanding in the physical way., esports demand other kind of talents as concentration, reaction, planification and such. PewDiePie read the question wrong, they are not asking for physical demand, they are talking about physical sports.
The question never said gaming is physically as demanding as physical sport they said gaming is just as demanding as physical sport which are 2 very different things. So what they truly asked is do you need to work (effort, practice, how much time you spend for training practising etc.) just as hard to be competitive in gaming as those that play physical sport and the answer is yes. But if you want to be technical even gaming is physically intense last time I checked brain activity is physical response (electrons rushing all over the place) and it is just as physically intense as physical sport after hours of playing on a high level you get tired right? When you train for lots of hours you get tired? You see the connection? Also nah sweetheart. What you said to be the definition of a career isn&#39;t true. It might have been in 20th century but not in 21st ;)
Columbine inspired video games more than video games inspired columbines.
I worked at a customer service job lol. I had the get professional help after hundreds of same jokes every single day. Welp, psychiatrists took over and you&#39;ll guess the rest of it lol.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=772">12:52</a> I don‚Äôt think he would rn because his among us videos always get at least around 3mil views
The whole &quot;girls can&#39;t play video games&quot; is so dumb to me. Like it&#39;s like a playing a board game. <br><br>(Honestly I don&#39;t really even know if this is a real thing.)
Get back in the kitchen guy thinks gaming physically taxes you more than golf. Grab 100 gamers and 100 golfers and have them talk diet,daily routine and physique. Then we can really see. Law of large numbers.
It‚Äôs weird cause every gamer lobby has trash talk.
With the gaming being as demanding as physical sports question, I think its all about if we are talking physically or mentally, they never specified, physically irl sports win every time but mentally i think online might have the edge just because they sit in the same place for hours doing the same thing getting hate comments at the same time which are probably going to be worse than the ones for irl sport, so its tricky
INGSOC
The statement wasn&#39;t &quot;gaming is just as PHYSICALLY demanding as physical sports&quot;, it was &quot;gaming is just as demanding as physical sports&quot;.  In terms of physicallity obviously physical sports are more demanding.  In terms of dedication, psychology, and practice and all the other things that go into being on top of either gaming or sports I would say they are just as demanding as each other.  Asking if physical sports are more physically demanding than video games is a dumb comparison to make and its funny that EVERYONE including pewds (apart from that one guy) took the statement to mean just that.
Thank you Pewdiepie for walking so I could run I love the games I have
Youtube is so unreliabile says pewdiepie, will also making millions a year
Bruh video games did not inspire Columbine... that‚Äôs gotta be the dumbest shit I heard all day
Are these really pro gamers? I genuinely get told to kill myself because im not as good as other people... Gaming culture isnt misogynistic, its just harsh. Everyone shit talks, and it doesnt depend on your gender. Yall just need to get thicker skin.
if violence is caused by video games then car crashes are caused by hot wheels?
I can&#39;t play anything online without dudes asking for pics or dming me or telling me I&#39;m not good or ignoring my info or calls.
Wow like 20% more viewers are subscribed now
I‚Äôve been gaming for so many years but I‚Äôve never had people coming at me because I‚Äôm a female, I‚Äôve had people talking shit but never mentioned the gender lmao üòÇ
At least my experience with being a woman (in South America) is that when I told my (male)friends I wanted to play video games with them, they would just ignore me and not let me play :(
HOLY TF UP is that ghost ayden üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇwtfüòÇ
board games cause death
I can&#39;t ever think back to a time as a woman where I was playing a game and something someone said to me online ever bothered me lmao if you can&#39;t handle being talked to disrespectfully then you shouldn&#39;t play online lol
Ugh I love the men in the comments trying to find flaws in the girls argument about how she has experienced misogyny for 10-15 years as if gameboys, D.S&#39;s and other consoles didn&#39;t exist that girls would be called weird for owning/playing. Misogyny is not just demonstrated by males, it could be another woman that would comment &quot;that&#39;s not girly&quot; or &quot;wouldn&#39;t you rather play with dolls&quot;
Felix not Making a good living out of gaming got me
I know girls who have had games, skins, keyboards, dlc bought for them by men who wanted to play it with them. These women will get carried by dudes who like having women around. &quot;Titty streamers&quot; make absolute bank having dry, boring personalities with zero game sense. To pretend that &quot;we have it hard&quot; in the gaming world is essentially a victim complex.
god that woman in the red is so annoying
I agree with Poods lol. Every time I express that I wanna play, people are cool with it. Tbh the majority of negative feedback I get in regards to video games is honestly from other women. But tbh idc lol. But that‚Äôs my experience, I‚Äôm not a real gamer anyways, just a casual lol
But gaming itself isn‚Äôt misogynistic the gamers are but in the same case guys get the same shit online we just take it off as a joke <br><br>But gaming itself isn‚Äôt against women at all
Ignoring misogyny is different than there is no misogyny. I literally don‚Äôt talk when I game because whatever I do, it‚Äôll be reflected on my gender somehow. Why cant I just be good or shit as a gamer and not represent a whole gender of people? I have been told ‚ÄúI dont care about what a girl has to say‚Äù many times, even when I don‚Äôt even talk or say a word.
Why the f do people bring on gender in gaming üôÑ both genders struggle in gaming
If you were to agree with saying that a physical sport is just as hard as a video game, you would have to be throwing your desk out the window or like benching your bed.
Pro gamers what you hear click click click <br><br>Foot ball what you hear of ouch grunts
I wonder if they know there is a mute button
Kinda funny that he asked the definition of misogynistic. Without context, I dont think I would recognize that word
Yea gaming is misogynistic but most times it&#39;s all jokes. Everyone calls anyone a sissy tbh. If you want equality in gaming your going to get treated like everyone else just bc your a girl doesnt make it anymore offensive as if it were said to your brother lol
I need a definition
Don&#39;t be dissing Runescape Pewds, you fat. :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=381">6:21</a> actually this is sooo accurate, when i play COD MW every guy just starts screaming go to the kitchenüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Redbull is a great chaser / mixer for alcohol hahaha had to say bc of the beginning

It‚Äôs lowkey sad that felix has to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a joke‚Äù after everything he says
If I had a dollar for every time I was told some shit like get back in the kitchen, go make a sandwich, go play with makeup etc, I&#39;d be richer than PewDiePie.<br><br>I still don&#39;t think games are anti-women though, those people are just disrespectful assholes.
heres one,all gamers reload after shooting at least 1 bullet shot
Pewdiepie &quot;I HAVE NEVER SAID ANYTHING STUPID IN MY LIFE!!&quot; also the bridge.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=602">10:02</a> - the don‚Äôt say physically demanding, they say demanding. I would stay neutral because all roles are demanding in different ways. - from a non gamers opinion
Bruh gaming is not misogynistic, people are. Calm down and mute the fuckin lobby.  You really mean to tell me that angry birds is on the same level of misogyny as cod bo2. No bruh. Just people
The fact that Felix has to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a joke‚Äù every time he says something to avoid media outbreak is kinda depressing
Ariana is the biggest gamer Karen I&#39;ve seen in a while
ITS HUGS
As soon as they said ‚Äúdo video games encourage violence‚Äù I got SO pissed
Pee
I dont know what game lobbies shes playing in but whenever a girl hopped into a mw2 or bo2 lobby everyone simped the shit out of her
Young female in the front couldn&#39;t make a decision on her on own if her life depended on it. Watch how she has to look out the corner of her eyes to follow the crowd the majority of the time. Shows her insecurities via her body language in one obvious way.
Im sad...pewds is a simp, people in the internat are toxic no metter your gender
Do all people think the same?
Hello guys more power to you...
why is there women there?

They all agree trash talk is part of the fun but 5 minutes before they thought gaming was mysoginistic because people say mean things to girls and everyone.
Also like- not all video games are violent. Like Mario, nothing violent there.
The red girl isnt really a gamer in my opinion
They didnt say &quot;is it equally physicly demanding&quot;, read the damn question again lol is it as demanding, meaning thinking is demanding and if you need to do as much of it, and train as much as some physical sport, its the same, they .. god damnit, READ THE DAMN QUESTION RIGHT!
the red girl is a karen
Doesn‚Äôt it make more sense to say ‚ÄúI ran so you could walk‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI walked so you could run‚Äù cus don‚Äôt people rather walk. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=917">15:17</a>
Being ‚Äúanti-women‚Äù is subjective. Gamers will diss everyone and anyone. If you believe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a women than gaming is anti-women. Just like if I were to be insulted I could believe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm black and gaming culture is racist, when in reality everybody is insulted in gaming regardless of your gender, race, etc.
i like energy drinks &quot;shows water bottle&quot;
Nonono we need REAL gamers like Pewds, Mark, Jack, etc. not these noobs üò©
Trash talk is part of the fun except when it with a girl gamer basically all i learned this video.

how tf did they get aydan on a jubilee vid?
I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs not overwatch lmao
The guy who had to think about the energy drink question was probably thinking about his sponsors lol
Runescape and halo 5
We love trash talk, but if you trash talk women than all video games are misogynistic.
I can&#39;t vote here. I&#39;m trash at games to the point where I&#39;m relying on being trash. Then ther&#39;s the akward part that at one point I was at least decent.
Fat!!
I never said anything stupid in my life remember the bridge
This dude plays Fortnite AND has a girlfriend? He is the imposter for sure, that just can&#39;t be true. Fortnite players are not even gamers.
I thought everyone likes gamergirls and not call them fat XD
Red shirt girl isn&#39;t a gamer
Says my gaming videos don‚Äôt do that well uploaded an hour ago 500k views lol
i get told to get back to the kitchen in almost every game i play
I‚Äôm on the toilet I fell like lava is pouring out of me
I walked so you could run. Wow. That&#39;s so nice and generous and beyond if it&#39;s true. You must have some big love in you if so. So... thank you, former nonwalker mistery bard
Me who doesn‚Äôt like energy drinks: Maybe I‚Äôm not a gamer

The government encourages violence, always pressured to ‚Äúserve the country‚Äù in reality you‚Äôll be taking some ones life. Video games are simulated nonexistent humans. Video games is an outlet for the sick fucks that like gore and violence.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=322">5:22</a>  Very well said.
Did he get his girlfriend from Minecraft lol ¬Ø\_( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_/¬Ø
Actually Felix, it&#39;s not Overwatch it&#39;s I don&#39;t know what the first game was but the second was Fortnite
If a women want to play video game with me, I would play them.
Just make them argue about tier lists instead

The gal has Obviously_Queen as her gamertag and complains about the trash talk that is aimed towards her for focusing on the fact she&#39;s a gal?  (Shit sentence I know)<br><br>Maybe think about the name you choose next time. If I choose gamertags such as XXXcum_swallower69 or XXXG4m3r_W0m4nXXX I expect people to aim their insults at them bad gamertags. Don&#39;t take part into trash talk if you can&#39;t take insults. Don&#39;t pick out fights you lose.
Not gonna lie what does ‚ÄúSame‚Äù mean
they:omg there is so much misoginy<br>also them:trash-talking is fun<br>THE HYPOCRISY
Note that the question didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúphysically demanding‚Äù, it just said ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù. As both an athlete and moderately competitive gamer I would strongly agree, because while they‚Äôre demanding in different ways, they‚Äôre both very demanding at high level. When it comes to competing against other human players, the amount of skill and dedication required evens out between all mediums because no matter if it‚Äôs video games or sports, as long as there‚Äôs a big competitive community, the players will push each other to put in the most effort possible.
If girls can‚Äôt handle hate don‚Äôt play the game it happened to boys girls can‚Äôt handle it don‚Äôt play
WTF WAS THAT ADD WITH THE BUNNY?????
hmm this video had a weird smell.. the smell of a feminist
Gaming culture isn&#39;t misogynistic. It&#39;s toxic. The reason you get &quot;bullied&quot; for being a woman in gaming, is because it&#39;s an easy way to rile you up, because it&#39;s an easy to notice uncommon characteristic. That&#39;s how bullying works. You take the outliers and make fun of them. It&#39;s the same for men who work in fashion or the makeup industry. It doesn&#39;t mean the makeup or fashion industry is misandrist, it just means that being a man in the makeup industry is an uncommon characteristic, thus making you an easy target for bullying.
She said she has been called fat and other names in video games for 15 years. She would‚Äôve been 4 then. And she‚Äôs playing halo, one of the least toxic communities in gaming. She would last a second in a MW2 lobby. And I feel like it‚Äôs something you sign up for playing games
I don&#39;t even know the definition of thst
When the trash talking part came up I laughed in my head and said I called this kid adopted one time
Simp
You hear TT a lot on Physical Sports.
On the second round i said to myself &quot;Gamers are Gamers&quot; so i disagree.
Videogames and other media not make violent (unlike religion).<br>Its mostly unstable losers who use videogame as excuse, if anything videogames has the opposit effect, after annoying day at work and hatred to coworked 20 kills later in game and i am over it.
on the misogynistic part, when was the last time someone donated their life savings so a <b>guy</b> could say their name?
You have to make money for people to realize it&#39;s a career... üôà ü§£ü§£ü§£ Yes that&#39;s the point of working. It&#39;s like saying &quot;You have to get pregnant for people to realize you have a baby&quot;
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the definition of a girlfriend‚Äù<br><br><b>has a literal freaking wife</b>
Mostly its those gamer girls that go out there and be super loud about being a girl. Those are who ends up being bullied. I&#39;ve met loads of gamer girls who i didnt even know to be girls until we&#39;d be voice chatting. In the end of the day, it never even mattered. Just dont go out there and act as if you deserved special treatment or attention just because you&#39;re a girl! Both guys and girls will get shitted on and tbagged eventually.
I respect people with the skills to game well, that takes practice and some qualities not everyone has. But physically it‚Äôs not the same. They‚Äôre both respectable but physical sports takes hours of physical labor and work on top of the physical training, chance of injury in games, etc.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=424">7:04</a> wtf is that sound lol
Fat
They had an interesting discussion about misogyny in gaming. I&#39;m a woman myself and I play quite a lot. I do not play professionally but have spent enough hours gaming to say that I game. My boyfriend is more of a gamer than I am, but even he said multiple times that I&#39;m better at games than he is. So yes, women can definitely play and play well. The better question is &#39;Do they want to?&#39; For me, the answer is yes. Experiencing games like Zelda Breath of the Wild or Ori and the Blind Forest for the first time is a magical experience.
I think girl have it way easier in streaming because that&#39;s why you can find diamond 4 male league of legend players with 4 viewers a day but then there is a lot of girls who are silver with 100 viewers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=598">9:58</a> unless i am retarde i am preety sure the question was as demanding and not as physically demanding so yes i agree that it&#39;s as demanding, not physically demanding, but it&#39;s still heavely demanding
Why is golf a sport?
The fact that this man is able to afford to live in Silicon Valley, even if his income is not exclusively from gaming, is evidence that he does in fact make a good living from gaming...

how can you say: &quot;trashtalk is part of the fun&quot; and also say, women have it harder then men because they get called names (trashtalk???)<br>does not compute

That ain‚Äôt Overwatch
In the mid 1980s, we had an &quot;arcade&quot; and I played 1942, Galaxia, Qbert, Wonder Boy, and race car games much, much better than any guy! I could play those games for HOURS!
the dude with the bandana is a walmart version of ninja
They wouldn‚Äôt last in MW2 lobbies, and Rainbow Six Siege is getting up there now too
&quot;is as demanding&quot; not  &quot;as physically demanding&quot;, since pro gamers spend hours of time honinh their skills then yes, it is as demanding, just not so much physically.

I would rather be a girl gamer then a squeaker gamer
I agree with that guy who talked about the arcade thing. When I was younger, I used to play video games with my cousin on his PS2. But for some reason, on his birthday, all his male friends decided to just kick out all the girls from the room while they played on the Playstation, and I wasnt allowed to play with them just cuz I was a girl. I was told to go play with dolls with his sister and her friends. Just hated the whole &quot;you&#39;re a girl, you&#39;re supposed to like pink, sit a certain way and play with dolls.&quot;

I think video games, rather than ENCOURAGING violence, it more desensitizes us to violence. And it&#39;s not just video games too, many forms of media include violence, fighting scenes, blood. Even the news desensitizes us to violence in a way, murders and assaults are reported every day. Some people feel for victims more than others, but it would be absurd to claim that daily exposure to these events wouldn&#39;t affect people somehow.

As far as mysogeny goes, I feel like in my experience whenever I would go to the video game club on my campus and ask the guys if I can play with them they were all extremely welcoming and excited to see a girl interested. I think online, people are just meaner to others in general.

Aye you know what I like fortnite so seeing aydan here was really cool
I got a pewdiepie ad
Dollar tree ninja is in the back.
Gaming isn&#39;t necessarily &quot;anti-women&quot;. There are so many supportive gamers now. But there are also those guys that say women can&#39;t play, make fun of them, &quot;go back to the kitchen&quot;. I have been told that many times and it&#39;s makes it hard to play online because those guys are asses. Like I said, there are so many supportive gamers and it makes it so much fun. But not everyone is supportive.
Yo mama
NGl females have an advantage because of all the simps
Me: hey guys Want to pl..<br>Everyone: FAT
I&#39;m about to get sexist.

Ok I game and on gta or cod black ops 4 or 3 I get called trash especially on gta they will kill me call me trash so I will go after them and I will kill them and they will call me a wimp like
He thinks too much
People say &quot;this game encourages violence&quot; guess what, it has been happening in real life everyday since your last name wasnt&#39; a thing.
girl: complains about being called fat then says that she calls people virgins<br>me:WTF
If I bring my switch and play smash at school I get ridiculed by everyone apart from some girls are hot but also think me and my friends are cute for playing it. Kinda weird
They glamourise violence not encourage it
The main multiplayer game I play is overwatch and I use the find a group feature and there are lot of girls and I‚Äôve never heard anything sexist/misogynistic etc.

Pewds: Energy drinks with alcohol!? Isn&#39;t that super unhealthy? Don&#39;t people die from that?<br>Me with my caffeine pills and vodka while watching this: NervousPuppetMonkey.jpg
They didnt really specify that its as fysically demanding, just demanding. :)
COLUMBINE WAS NOT INSPIRED BY VIDEO GAMES BIG MISCONCEPTION THEY ORIGINALLY WANTED TO BOMB THE PLACE THATS NOT A BIG VIDEO GAME THING
Holy shit ghost Aydan was in this shit.
Some gamers may be misogynistic but the gaming industry isn‚Äôt.

PLOT TWIST:<br>Pewdiepie knows it isn&#39;t a joke everytime he says it is. He just knows if he didn&#39;t it would cause a Civil War and a Rebellion in the NINE YEAR OLD ARMYYYY
Gaming is antiwamen when they don&#39;t know how to jump in Minecraft
&quot;My gaming video don&#39;t do so good anymore&quot; <br>Sven: <b>Intense breathing</b>
fortnite isnt a game its a knock off of a knock ofrf
Girls ... Everyone talks shit on everyone in the game. Guys bash men and women. Women bash both as well. Not everything that happens to ppl is because they&#39;re part of this or that group lol
the girl in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=68">1:08</a> looks like the russian girl in 90 day fiance
The misogynist question or rather the answers on them (except the one girl) are soo stupid. Misogynist-basically meaning anti-woman industry and yet you have two Pro-gamer girls...like wtf? Are gamers predominately  man? Yes, that doesn&#39;t mean it misogynistic..like wtf??...
Some of these people talk about streaming yet they are all pretty boring
IN RUSSIA, GAME IS GAME
Water
If youve got a mic on games you&#39;re going to be slandered beyond belief for no reason whatsoever.

Walmart ninja getting hyped bout trash talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Xm8c1gtRA&amp;t=253">4:13</a> - 10-15 YEARS AGO?  She was 8-3 years old?!?!?  She was not even playing games competitively that requires 18 for the game she claims anyways...
Guy: I used to sleep on a mattress on the floor<br><br>Me: YOU WET BLANKET I SLEEP ON A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR AND ITS GREAT
Gaming community isnt anti women, just some communities are toxic but they are toxic to everyone
I hate the Walmart version ninja
I need a definition of what a girlfreind means I am laughing my head of
Women: We get called names and get made fun of <br>Men who survived MW2 lobbies: üò§
I think if they made video games as demanding as sports, then ppl would be super good at video games
Imagine, Pewdiepie would have listened to his parents
&quot;PROPLAYERS&quot; who the fuck are those randoms? For real, can some1 answer me?
Girls are too sensitive and cant fuck around like a name calling argument between dudes on bo2
The question wasn&#39;t whether competetive gaming is as psychically demanding as sport. So sorry Pewds but your argument is invalid af
