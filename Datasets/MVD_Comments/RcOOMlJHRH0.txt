Nah. Only the score matters as it decides your future. No future, no life. So, it&#39;s better to work hard for a great future &amp; do whatever possible for that. If you still don&#39;t get what you struggled for, your life is in your hands. You can morph it. So, tatakae!
Love BB you are best
It’s 2023 and this video still makes me cry..If you are reading this comment Bhuvan sir.... Thank you for this video and god bless!!

mere maa baap toh bachpan se kehte aare hain &quot;acche number nahi aaye toh naak katt jayegi hamari terko gharse nikal dege&quot; aur ab bhi kehte hain lol
Mere bhi 10th par 54 aa ya the 😢

bb is something that is to a next level
I don&#39;t know why I am not trying hard 😔<br>I have everything money for books , college, etc. I don&#39;t have interest in studying but my father tells me without studying nothing is possible. I don&#39;t know how to communicate with people, no friends, no one supports me. I fight alone. Sometimes my parents scolds me,  but in exam results time they don&#39;t....... i don&#39;t understand why God made me 😢
❤❤❤
I failed in my 12th std board exm got 46% but still failed in phy n maths.<br>Left studies coz didnt wanted to make Career through it.<br>1 yrs completely drp out until covid came n made things even worst ! Again 1 yr drp out.<br>I was 2 yrs behind in my life<br>Then reality hit me up, understood things, become wise and now I&#39;m in my final yr preparing for MBA<br>Not sure whether I&#39;ll crack into IIMs but I&#39;ll surely land up in 1 of d top B-schools in India<br>Again I&#39;ll come on this channel till then wait for my comment coz only in this video I felt myself 🙂not a die hard BB fan but this this is d perfect gem of all BBs creation 😇

Parenting tip: Samaj aur bachhe ki beech ki diwaar hote hai Maa Baap❤
3000 love bb

Only applicable for younger child and those parents who have only one child!!!!!!!!!!!😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨<br>Elder child ko to kuchvhi bol dete hain!!!!!😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨

thank u
Love you bro ❤ motivation ke liye
Mujhe ghanta phark nhi padta 😂
I love this video ❤ thank you
2023 legend ❤❤
Heart touching story bhuvan bhaiya
Mera dost tha bachpan mei woh bahut smart aur topper hua karta tha uske class Mai ek din kya hua +2 mai isne 60 percent laye aur phir woh bahut udas hua aur usne suicide kar diya . It is true&#39;incident
Bhai rula diya aaj
watched this four years ago, but didn&#39;t connect with the meaning that much. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I loved the video even back then.. but after four years when I have faced so many failures since last year, I&#39;m crying so much after watching this. My parents are very supportive. but still, I just don&#39;t want to be a disappointment to them anymore...
One of the best video on bb ki vines ❤
Maa baap Aisa tabhi keh pate Hain jab unhone apne bacche ko mehnat karte dekha hota hai<br>Nhi toh generally bahar ke disappointment utar hi dete hain<br>Personal experience hai bhai<br>Pehle lagta tha mere maa baap aise nhi Hain<br>Wo mujhe dushro se compare nhi karte <br>Par wo tab tak tha jab humare sab se jyada acche result ate the<br>Jese hi mukam se thoda niche utre toh pehle toh expectation pe na utarne ka tag laga<br>Aur ab sach me lagta hai &#39; sab kuch ek bar mein ruk jaye&#39;
Agar parents bhuvam ke papa ki tarah supportive hoge to suicide rate kam ho jayge
Exact same situation;percentage , friend mark😅❤
😢
Yeh video mere ghar walo ke pass jaldi se jaldi jaana chahiye kitabo ka bozzz bana diya hai mere uper

My father called in the night and I couldn&#39;t resist myself from telling my mother and father about the backlog.  And I started crying like a child .<br><br>And my mother said &quot;Ki hoyeche backlog peyechis toh, jibon sesh thodiy hoye gelo, kanna bondho kor ,jibone badha to asbei ,keu tor pase thakuk na thakuk,tor maa baba ache ,er besi ki chai tor?<br><br>I&#39;m grateful and blessed to have parents like them.  <br><br><br>I will definately bump this after 5 years.

I wish every parents could think like this
reality hits when you understand there was no friend it was bhuvan&#39;s feelings all along
Ese parents sabko mile yaar ❤
This is soo deep. Parents sometimes can’t understand the effect of there words nd support towards the child. At that point children become vulnerable. Help people around u, u don’t know how much someone need to have a polite conversation. That’s oll u need to do, just say THEY CAN.
Hi, bb vines. Maybe you Won&#39;t even read my comment. But yes, I am from Bangladesh &amp; going through my admission phrase very awfully. I have already disappointed my parents &amp;...i can relate with everything that Bhuvan us feeling right now. This video, just made me feel light. I think the thoughts that are in my head now are common but exceptional would be to pass this phrase..Thanks buddy 🇧🇩❤️

BB sir emotional video ......hai yeh heart touching 😓
The best ever moral video I had ever seen
BB be like ; Timepaas ni hora chlo kisi video ka thumbnail change krdeta hu😂😂
Yaar 75% aaye hai..  Aur baaki saaro kr 80 above aaye.. Bohot bura lg rha hai kyuki papa ko khushi ki mithai nhi khila paungi.  Baaki sab k parents ne apne baccho k liye cake aur mithai laayi,  bs mai hi bach gyi...  Mere bhsi behen saare smart hai aur unka apne apne school mai reputation hai,  meri respect hi nhi h.  Mujhe yeh bhi nahi pata ki joh mujhe banna hai voh mai ban bhi paungi ki nhi.  Mere parents toh yeh bhi nahi jaante ki mujhe banna kya hai,  even though maine unhe 10000 baar bta di ho.  Kuch support nhi... Yaar mai bohot hi zyada nalayak hu.
I wish mere parents bhi aise hote 😊💔
Watching this just 4days before my board result.I don&#39;t know what will happen to my results but i definitely got the inspiration form the video to face the results.💜
Sab maa baap ase nahi hote Bhai 😢😢😭
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Fail hone k baad aaya hu😅❤
Har ka swaad chakh to liya hai, udaas bhi hoon bohot, gussa hai apne upar, manzil ke samne hote huye bhi pohoch na saka, par koi nehi phir se manzil ke liye chalenge, daurenge, aur iss bar manzil tak pohochke rehenge, manzil bht dur hai par Safar ka maza lenge iss bar, pohochenge phir idhar Laut ke aayenge , iss comment pe, zaroor wapas aayenge

Every Indian parents are like Bablu ji you have to show the brighter side of your&#39;s to your parents. they will fight with god to save you if you share all talks with your parents
Mere parents NE to kabhi mujhe padhai  ke liye kuch nahi kiya kyoki vo mujhe pressure nahi Dena chahte the <br>Love you  parents

It&#39;s reality ❤
My friend committed suicide the same day our 12th result were announced just because he failed in maths.<br><br>The most cheerful funny and entertaining kid in the whole class commited suicide after failing a single subject.<br>I couldn&#39;t believe it when that happened.
today may 2023 result of board and i passed in all sub. but somehow my friend failed and i send this video love you bb dil se
The sad part is that here 90% are students
Kash board exam ki results out hone ke Sabhi parents kooh yeh dekh kar samajh na chahiye ki relatives or paroshi toh mazzak uraaa rhi hai number kam or fail hone ke wajha se ushh waqt just parents toh sath deh aapne baccho ko 😢😔
Bhuvan bhai 3 ,4 baar dekh fir se Rona aagaya
Bhaiya sabke maa baap aisa nahi sochte hai. Aur ek middle class family se koi ho to usske pass ek hi option hai job karo aur jindagi sudharo. 10th mai mere 80 % aaye aur mere relative ke bache ke 88% aaye mujhey bhi bura laga. Lekin meri maa ne mujhey bas etna bola ki dekho wo padha tab na usse 88 aaya.<br>Mai maa se hamesha kehta hu ki dusro ke bacho ka example ya wo itna laya mujhey mat bola karo aur maa bolti bhi nahi h lekin unhe bhi to bura lagta hoga na. Aur wo jo bhi bolti hai wo mujhey yahi feel dilata hai ki maine padhai nahi ki isme mai maa ki galti nahi bata raha hu lekin khud ke bare mai bol raha hu. Aur papa ka hai ki wo sirf film (3 idiot) dekhte wakt hi bolte hai ki number mayine nahi rakhta knowledge rakhta hai lekin wakt aane par sab badal jata hai. <br>Jo mujhey pasand hai mai wo bhi nahi kar sakta society ke according kuch hi carrier option hai doctor, engineer, government job, etc. Ham middle class walo ko inhi mai se chunna padta hai hamse nahi pucha jata ki tum kya karna chahte ho. <br>Arre number kab aane ya padhai kam karne par to papa aur kabhi kabhi maa bhi bol dete hai ki chalo tumhe kisi mechanic ke dukan mai kaam pakadwa de. Wo ye soch ke bolte hai ki ye sunn ke ye padhne lagega lekin wo ye nahi sochte hai ki ye sunn kar mujhpe kya bitegi. <br>Literally bhaiya mai ye sunn ke bahar se roya nahi andar se phut phut ke roya. <br>Kabhi kabhi lagta hai ki ham to iss duniya mai aaye hi hai society ke isaro pe nachne. <br>Bahut bura lagta hai jab mere relatives jaan buchke apne bacho ke number mujh se jayada batate hai jab ki hote nahi hai bahut bar lekin meri maa unko sach bolti hain kyuki unko jhut bolna nahi aata hai. <br>Aur mai bhi nahi bolta<br>Bhaiya bas itna hi kahunga last mai ki abb agar iss duniya se jis din vida lunga na mai chahunga jab bhi kabhi insan ke bache mai janam hone lage mai paida hi na hunnn. <br>Aane wale samay mai jo paristhitiyan hone wali hai wo sahniye nahi hoga. <br>Bahut acha laga ki koi to apne bacho ko Anne wale future mai samjhega. <br>Kass jaise isme apne dikhaya waise hi mere parents ham sabhi ke parents hote..................................... 😔😔😔😔😔😔😞
bb mera abhi jee ka result aaya hai 75 pr only

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOOMlJHRH0&amp;t=120">2:00</a> magical words by Bablu ji...♥️
You know what is the main reason of depression at the time........that line is &quot;Log kya kahenge&quot; and thats truth.
Made my heart heavy sir 🫂❤️
Sandeep Maheshwari show ke bad dekh rehi to like karo
Thank you so much for this video BB.  Whatever you mentioned in this video, it&#39;s all true. I was a failure in high school, gave 5 re-tests. Everyone taunted, said I&#39;ll not be able to achieve anything in life.<br><br>Now, after years, I am a manager in an international company and earn more than 70% of the students in my class. I can say that I laugh when I look back at myself. Never thought I&#39;ll be accomplishing.
Watching before 2023 boards 💔
love u bb 🥺🥺🥺🥺
&quot;Your marks are completely proportional to your income &quot;<br>This line is a pure lie but the biggest problem is parents do not believe this and they also don&#39;t want to believe this.<br>This is not their mistake , it is the mistake of society which made this stereotype and attached in parents mind
💖💖💖
I really started to crying .. when I watched it..
I just cried for hrs after watching this video
😔😔❤️‍🔥
akmoast cried nice video
My life flashed in this video 🙂
Not all parents are like this...
Literally cried while watching this
Awesome video 😍
5days later i have my boards 2023 ..and i am scared what if i cant get above 90% then i came across this video. Thank u very much I am a PCMB student i failed in 11 ,i even failed in 12 half yearly and periodic exams and in preboards i got just 21. Most of the relatives or elders blame Online EDUCATION FOR THIS . I STUDY FROM LAKSHAY NEET BUT PROBLEM IS I COULDNT DO REVISION AND PRACTICE PROPERLY due to Backlogs .But Now I solved NCERT, did PYQs ,just more revision left and i hope to score 90% without taking the tension what will happen if i dont!!. THANK YOU BHVAM BHAI FOR THIS VIDEO<br><br>TO ALL THOSE WHO WILL WATCH THIS COMMENT IN THE RECENT DAYS, some of u maybe in better situaton than me ,someof you maybe in similar situation like me , some of you maybe in worse situation than me. BUT MORE THAN SITUATION WHAT MATTERS IS <br>DOING THINGS EFFECTIVELY EVEN AT THE LAST DAYS.. EVERYONE THOUGHT INDIA WOULD LOSE AGAINST PAK IN T20WC MATCH<br>BUT LATER MIRACLES HAPPEN AND VIRAT JUST BLAST IT OFF.<br><br>SO yes please at this last days ..make a concise list what to do and how to do and mug up if u cant remember<br>and for those whose exms are still more than 4months away . LIFE IS JUST LIKE A SIN GRAPH KEEP WORKING,KEEP PRACTICING,KEEP REVISING
Literally cried watching this video.
Thank You, I needed that.<br>Abhi 10th ke boards aane waale hai aur tension bhi ho raha tha, thank you ❤️💫
This video means a lot for me for my lifetime
Best vedio i ever seen ❣️
I love you so much BB :&#39;)<br>Stumbled upon this video on such a day when I was feeling extremely low, this brought a smile to a face. You&#39;ll perhaps never know how many times these videos have saved me. Whatever you are doing now, the success, the fame, you deserve every bit of it ❤️
Motivationnn 😑😑😑

The part where he confesses about his suicidal thoughts 😢
How can i miss this vedio
This the called content
this video is 3 year ago when i was 15 and passing from pain buz my pain die and maybe i dont see  this video but i understand this video to much
Teen saal Baad bhi dekha toh ye cheez itni relatable lagi (FYI: Ab mei job krta ho isliye bola), social pressure logo ko zindagi bhar rehta hai, toh isliye always see yourself &amp; try your best, never compare with others (because they also do) be unique by thinking 💭.<br>We always compare ourself with others either it&#39;s marks, toys, House, partner, money etc. Or SOMETIMES EVEN LIFE 🙄🤨😟
💙💙💙✨
i dont know ...but everytime i see this video,it hits really hard.
Bb ki vines video fully of funny ; but this one touch my Heart ❤️

Kabhi kisi kale aadmi ko is topic ke upar video bnate hue dekha hai no because nobody gives a fuck chahe hazaro aise video bana lo lekin at the end of the day sabko pata hai ki kala hona sharam ki baat hai tm kale ho toh tumhari value automatically niche giregi bhale tm dil se jitne bhi a6e ho

I gave my class 12th board in 2019 and I failed in that. I went into deep depression. But I didn&#39;t loose myself. I gave exam again in 2020 and passed with 66.4%. Now I am in 6th semester of my Engineering without any backlogs. From next semester campus placement will start in my class. Hope I will get job in good company❤️

This is the only family video of BB which makes feel positivity to the parents.

His acting is on another level, looks so real, and his message, truly a legendary creator❤️🔥👍
Goosebumps litrally my eyes fills with tears thats why i love bb.
That’s why bb my all time favourite YouTuber who can make us laugh and cry too by his motivational speech ❤🤧
😭😇❤️❤️❤️😭😭
I am giving my boards in 2023 and I teared up while watching this cuz the amount of pressure a child has if both the parents are educated and the child has facilities is too much for a child to handle single handedly
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Parents in parallel universe
idk how yt know what i exactly need in this moment i was crying because i was streesed because of my studies and you saved me🥺💗
After watching this i cannot believe that bhuvan bam is playing all these characters ✨❤️
Very emotional 😭
Pure YouTube pe is se acha video ho  hi nahi sakta 🙏
Bablo g great father 💕
Mana parents pyaar karte hai but jese jese bacha bada hota hai usspe responsibilities aane lagti hai aur vo bhi life ke sab se harsh phase se guzar raha hota hai ( teen) usse khud nahi pata hota BC chal kya Raha hai life aur parents ka unconditional love conditional ho jata hai aur vo ladka/ladki sirf physically jinda rehta hai but mentally totally maar jata hai
Maine yeh video mere papa ko dikhaya..<br>Vho ab bolte iske baaki video bhi dikha 😂
I&#39;m very proud to have such parents 😊
BB bhayya thankyou, isse zyada kuch kehne ko bhi nahi hai. I&#39;m a single child until I found you, you are like my elder brother. Ek na ek din aapse jaroor milungi bhayya. That&#39;s my aim 🥺❤
needed this <br>thanks bhuvan ❤
This had me in tears
Saare baap ese nahi hote 😏
very inspirational bhuvan sir
🙂🙂♥️♥️♥️
True words bhuvan bhaiya
sad reality is maa baap khare nhi rehete
Kash mere bhi parents yaise hote 🙂
Kash mere parents bhi aise hote

I&#39;m so glad that I have supportive parents.. in 10th boards i scored only 89% and i was so sad because it was one of the lowest marks i had ever scored bt my parents didn&#39;t said anything and told ki yeh marks bhi km nhi hai.. and now I&#39;m preparing for NEET. I wanna clear this exam in 1st or 2nd attempt.. 🙂
this got me gooosebumps and better concentration thank you bb

Every student needs supportive parents specially in board classes where everybody target them.
I really needed this video.
Hats Off Yrr
I still remember when I used to get less marks than my parents expectations. But my dad always believed me. Still he says that &quot;you have many opportunities don&#39;t give up &quot; . I&#39;m blessed to have supportive parents. I will make u proud dad ❤️i commented this cz I will get reminder daily ❤️
❤❤️
The pressure of career nowadays makes us have suicidal thoughts
A true story _<br>A boy who wants 98% in exams, he also do hard work but when result come his score is 90% he wants to quit every thing, he wants to suicide.<br>One day he standing on a bridge and attempting but just a old man come and said &quot; why you doing this ? Are you want to start again from kindergarten ?&quot;
I really love you bhuvan bhai 😍😍😍😍
Rula diya yaar
You are my reason to laugh and cry
My parents doesn&#39;t understand this 😓
thankyou❤🙌
Goosebumps
This kind of parents 💞❤️💙💖
This gives me goosebumps... 🥺❤i got tears in my eyes.....bhuvan and his parents 🥺❤... Feels like they are not character they are real. Real the people who exist 😩❤...Suddenly the realization that he has lost his parents 😭💔 but we are always with you as your family❤......Lots of love to you Bhuvan❤
Bhai har baar hasata hu... <br>Lekin aaj.... Emotional.... 🤧kar diya
The first video I liked ...<br>Of BB <br><br>Without any hesitation ...<br>Because it&#39;s a message of a acting father to every parent ....
LOVE you ❤️ bro and hate you 😈 bro
Same situation 😔😔😔😔 plz.
Thanks YouTube I am in 10th and my pre boards went bad and yt suggested this to me...<br>I will do it😃
BB KI VINES की आज तक कि सबसे अच्छी VIDEO
Bhai so inspiring rona agya!
This is the first time i cried after watching bhuvan&#39;s video
BB first imoshnal lesson ❤❤
ma ne is se ye sabak seekha k haar nahi marni chahiye<br>is liye ma bhi mehnat kr raha hn mujhe Allah pr pura yaqqe hai k aik na aik din mujhe zaroor kamiabi milegi<br>Ameen
I m watching this still, bcoz it is better than 1000 motivational videos
2019 me 12th hui thi meri.....below 80% percentage ke karan dukhi thi papa...11th me bhii kuch khas nahi the marks....phir indore se 12th ke baad galat coaching se NEET ke liye drop liya....covid bhii aagya....puri pdaii ki L lag gaye aur 433 marks aaye... obviously phir dukhi hue vishvas dikha kar ek aur drop dilvaya....NEET 2021 me time management nahi ho paya phy tough thi isliye...usme 542 aaye aur government college milne se 3 number se chuk gya tha..... the worst phase of my life ...bhut bure thoughts aaye like bhuvan said ki uske frnd ko aarahe the.... somehow i managed and result se next day i told my father that I&#39;ll do whatever he want....to do MBBS from private college... or to take drop...or to change course or to indulge into father&#39;s business....tab unhone bola ki tumhari marzi hai to ek aur baar karlo try, now is year ki NEET me sirf unke trust ke karan 650 marks with AIR 4326 aaye and obviously now I&#39;ll in AIIMS .<br><br>When bhuvan told ki safalta ki asli kadra usko hoti hai jo pehle haar dekh chuka hota hai hits me hard, and actually it&#39;s really worth it when you get success after failure 🔥<br><br>Just want to say keep your hardwork in right direction with right aim, definitely you&#39;ll see the outcome.<br> Ignore your sadness and just say &#39;Humare saath shri raghunath to kis baat ki chinta &#39;🕉️
Kash mere papa bhi isse hote 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺my heart got melted and just made cry 😭 kash mere papa bhi meri problem or meri mushkile samjhte 🥺

He knows his responsibility well👍 . Good bb.
I also got 65% in my exams and it was least in my friends circle but I overcome that failure and get the good marks later, <br>and then this video released by BB and I was smiling that how accurate is BB here!!!!.<br>But Now I am again in that phase which  is worst then before and I can&#39;t even smile cause I am not having any motivation because of stress. I liked this video at its release time and somehow it pop up at my screen. Thanks BB for such kinds of words ♥♥ 👑
