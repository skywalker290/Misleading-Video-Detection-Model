This is probably my 10th time seeing Jared. Jared lied.
I smiled ear to ear through the vid, it&#39;s soo damn wholesome üò≠
The fact that Pewds nipped it in the butt that you shouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed to go to the gym because you‚Äôre working on your self is wholesome. Still great meme though
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what grandmas do‚Äù MOVIE!!!

Where i live some robbers are like,dude we are also human so we will just take one thing and go away or the person who is getting robbed starts talking to the robber aboot life,but some of them are just normal robbers

*Pewds getting robbed<br>&quot;What a nice chance to look at memes&quot;
the dog with enormous health bar is the end boss :O
wheres the dark mode
that was the second time i&#39;ve seen jared
you can get an emotional support dog in nz
The Florida man  who slaped the woman is a shad
2 years ago... The time where pewd house in japan get robbed...<br>And now he finally stay in japan üòÇ Omg time flows so fast
Now that Pewds already made it to Japan, I wonder if he already gave his new neighbors some gifts
don&#39;t need you<br><br>right now
you are in japan now, so now it&#39;s time to give presents to all your neighbors
Terribly sorry to hear about the house in Japan. This is odd because crime is so low here. <br>But glad to hear you&#39;re in Japan now. Can&#39;t wait to see new content from Japan.
If you send a random number happy animal images, you have wings. No need to check over your shoulders. Just flex.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=156">2:36</a>   little did he know..
Also another note Im terrified to go the gym because I have no fucking idea what I&#39;m doing or where to start and I&#39;m terrified some asshole will record me doing something wrong or something instead of telling me. I also live in a horrible asshole ridden town where my family is known for being the problem family&#39; we&#39;re not a problem family most of the kids that went to school in this town have learning issues and I have autism and ADHD and a learning disability. Instead of accommodating and educating themselves and doing their fucking job the teachers would actively mistreat several siblings of mine, older and younger.
Wait I literally just thought the emotional support animal was a world wide thing. I didn&#39;t know it was just an American thing that&#39;s very interesting
Japan robbed? Doubt
Dude in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=674">11:14</a> is literally a chad

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=267">4:27</a> lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=262">4:22</a> he said: What is wrong with this cat? When the real question is what is right with this cat.
Whoever stole from pewds this one goes out to you:       ·∂†YÕßoÕ®·µèu
That last one made my day
you can have  a &quot;emotional support dog&quot; in almost every country in europe buy you have to have some documents from psychologists
I‚Äôve seen Jared 4 times now
ahh poor guy has two houses...
Good times :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=92">1:32</a> you know what will be a great cursed ending to that story that him and his son stop a suspect black American trust him of not having a gun then the fathers get shoots and dies in front of his own son, then after the incident the son is a racist cop for his entire life<br>That would be epic
‚ÄúShe looks amazing, obviously‚Äùü•∫
still cant believe You got robbed and said Well i got robbed ANYWAY LETS WATCH SOME MEMES
Bruh
i can confirm. watching this vid 2yrs ago was the last time i have seen and heard of Jared. he&#39;s really gone.
&quot;Why do we eat animals they&#39;re so cute&quot;<br>Well i could ask the same question but the opposite of it &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t we eat animals they&#39;re delicious.&quot;

Seals are actually sea puppies and you can&#39;t prove otherwise
I saw jared again
My dad is an animator and he worked on a few Courage The Cowardly Dog episodes.
For the most part emotional support dogs have to be trained.
Actually, there isn&#39;t a real consensus on whether a pregnant woman should give up smoking. Obviously, before you have a child, you should absolutely quit smoking because it is very bad for the child. When it is an accidental pregnancy, things get more complicated. Outright quitting can be very stressful, and that could also be unwise during a pregnancy, and yet every cigarette is harmful for the child. It is a matter of deciding which is worse. At the very least, a pregnant woman should cut back on the amount she smokes as much as possible.

moor video like this pelease pewdiepiop
Could have made a series called blessed or cursed and got fans to send memes and gifs.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=156">2:36</a> and then the world shut down...
I found out recently that the Grandfather from the Thanksgiving post passed away, but they still do it every year.
Lol
Jesus is coming
For real tho Pewds, your wedding picture is awesome. Love both of your outfits!
I&#39;m pretty sure Emotional Support Dogs are a thing in some countries in Europe actually! I think it&#39;s amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=750">12:30</a> we actually had a random fox appear on our front porch one night it followed us around and we fed it for about three or two days and it became very tame and never came back after the third day since it probobly got shot since my dad made a post about it on facebook :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=813">13:33</a> I like to take pizza slice, roll it into a pizza roll and then eat it, much faster to eat
A pewdiepie ad literally is in the video. I didn&#39;t even realize it was an ad.
And we thought Felix was weird for the way he ate his pizza
There&#39;s criminals in Japan?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=97">1:37</a> &quot;so you&#39;re shoot me like your dad did?&quot;

You‚Äôll be sad to hear that the ‚Äúgrandma‚Äù post about coming over for dinner has a sad news. The grandfather, husband, of the ‚Äúgrandma‚Äù passed away within the last year or two.
My mother did not smoke or drink during my oldest brother pregnancy and he has bad allergies and had pneumonia while she smoked for me I nerve had to deal with allergies or anything
Satan is wholesome too Pewds
Best pewds vid!!!!

Whhhat?! Rn what do you mean not rn ?
*Pewdiepie*: people don&#39;t eat seals<br><br>*people in the north pole*: Well, Actually
My sister eats pizza like that and she eats her burger as she rotates it
I&#39;m sorry felix, but people do eat seals. I&#39;ve heard they also use them for the oil from the fat. The folks in Alaska do it, not sure where else.
i neeeeeeed more
2nd time seeing jared
One time I saved a water hen while fishing.<br>The water hen was caught on the hook of my fishing rod ,because it had tried eat the maggot on the end of it.<br>So then I grabbed the hen and waited for my family to come over and help me get the hook out of its mouth.<br>We finally got the hook out and he flew back into the water happily.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=83">1:23</a> me: rewinds video
For some reason Pewds yelling at Satan to go away really made my day
Felix is definitely a satanic worshipper, I‚Äôm sure of it. Like how he said ‚Äúgo away Satan! I don‚Äôt need you right now.‚Äù<br>Is this a conspiracy theory? I think not. This is truth! He definitely made a deal with the devil.
WHAT? You never played tuber simulator? PFFFFFF
I love courge the cowdly dog. I wish I went to that school.
Pewds upload new video<br>Me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZyoz7cqSeo&amp;t=482">8:02</a>
That&#39;s a Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza. All of the ads for it in the 90s had people eating it crust first. I&#39;d rather save the crust for last so that it&#39;s like every slice comes with it&#39;s own mozzarella stick.
I come back to this video every time I feel down

When Felix said: Gramouflage i bursted in laugh.
I can answer the pizza one - I too eat like that. For me, I hate the crust because it&#39;s just plain bread, I eat that first and save the good part for last.
&quot;this is jared and you&#39;ll never see him again, say hi to jared&quot;<br><br>me watching this video for the 5th time: GOD DAMN YOU JARED

As much as the comments here contain so much &quot;He be rich as hell he can replace it&quot; I am so happy to see that everyone who understands sentimental value are the ones with 10x the thumbs up. Some people just don&#39;t understand that things like family members and animals just cannot be replaced. I swear half of the people who talk about insurance and PewDiePie just replacing things would more then happily sell there mother for money. To them I&#39;m sure they could just replace her.

As a gymbro, regarding the gym thing. People at the gym tend to be there for one reason, and that is to work out. If you&#39;re overweight and at the gym the most people will think of you is &quot;well done mate for taking the first step&quot;. So don&#39;t be afraid, just do your thing, be healthy and if you need/want help just ask for it, 99/100 people there will happily help you with your technique or recommend routines. But don&#39;t bother people with massive headphones, they wear them for a reason.

Hamilton was a Formel 1 driver and got in an accident and got burned really bad
I know Felix states that no matter your physical shape, you should not be embarrassed to be at the gym. I think that this is really good advice and need to think about this myself especially because I have felt often that something like this is much easier said than done, but he‚Äôs giving me inspiration to get out there and be myself. Pls like I want Felix to see this

You have a house in Japan? Noice
The dog has diamond armour on
Bruh the dog who came back with bros literally lived an anime season.
If you would have noticed. Pewdiepie was actually sad. :(( fake smiling.
This is the first time I ever heard that something in Japan was stolen or robbed. What AU was this from?
Wait, there&#39;s crime in Japan?
&quot;I need to look at some blessed images on reddit to know the whole world isn&#39;t just rotten&quot;<br>sorry pewds.. it already is..
There are banjo frogs in my area they are cool to listen to

It took me several years until I finally got to visit Japan. I had spent much time reading and learning about Japan and I had formed an opinion of a polite culture and a safe country. When I arrived in Tokyo I got to witness the first crime in my life when a dude bag robbed a girl right in front of my eyes.
Pewds:‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about curing diseases!!!‚Äù<br>2020:‚ÄùAre you sure about that?‚Äù

When he was talking about how emotional support animals are allowed in America, but won&#39;t fly in the UK I just wanted to talk about that. <br>As far as I know, in order to bring your emotional support animal places where they normally aren&#39;t allowed, you have to bring paperwork. And as far as I know, that paperwork requires to be signed by a licensed therapist. If the UK doesn&#39;t allow emotional support animals, that is utter stupidity. Some people need their dog, cat, bird, or otherwise to function properly because they might be traumatized and their pets are the best way they can cope with it.

&quot;Why do we eat animals? They are so cute&quot; true, but they&#39;re also very tasty. To quote some twitter user, &quot;if animals don&#39;t want to be eaten then why are they made out of food&quot; lol
