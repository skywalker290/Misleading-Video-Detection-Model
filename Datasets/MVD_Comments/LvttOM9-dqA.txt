Xperia 1 or OnePlus 7 Pro?
Im watching this video on my Sony Xperia 1 in 2023
Nice review but you are new to sony phones. You dont understand most Sony technologies
still good in 2023?
how come you don&#39;t mention that it has a headphone jack??
Sony💔🤍🤍🤍🇺🇿
can this phone be used on verizon&#39;s network?
Wow i didn&#39;t expect that to happen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=65">1:05</a> haha. Lets take a moment and apperciate all the hard work he puts into the content for us! Thanks for the videos.
I bought one in 2022 I miss these videos
Niiice 👌🏽
I&#39;m using Sony S5 for more than 2 years

Any review/ unboxing for sony Xperia 1 III?
Xperia 1 III started at 1300
How to find bin
Made In Japan
I use sony z3 plus long time ago best phone i ever have bofore it was disapointet afher it also disappointed but non of them was sony
Is there a headphone jack
not great enough. sony phone battery sucks
I&#39;m still rocking the XZ1 and my dad&#39;s got an XZ. Still going strong, the XZ is a lil bit laggy but I uninstalled any un necessary crap and it&#39;s perfectly usable especially for my dad. HTC, Nokia and Sony are very underrated these days.
I have only owned Sony Xperia phones for the past seven years. They&#39;re amazing performance machines and I&#39;m not talking about the amazing camera.
Is this phone worth buying in 2021? I&#39;m looking to move from Xiaomi to Sony.<br>Edit: it doesn&#39;t have headphone jack. :(<br>I think i&#39;m going to buy the 1 II. I really miss my Sony phones, i had a M4 Aqua and a C5 Ultra, and loved them. But i don&#39;t like my Xiaomi phone at all, the system has annoying and intrusive ads, like, i bought the phone and still get ads, and there is a ton of bloatware that can&#39;t even be disabled. I actually tried to install LineageOS, but i needed to wait 168 HOURS to unlock the bootloader. So yeah, i hate Xiaomi and want to move to Sony again.
Thanks you for your reviews I love it❤️
The long narrow design is annoying with all sony phones
nonono, its not experiment, its experimentia  ;-)
I have this phone and after their latest update my phone won&#39;t take calls unless I restart it, I talked to my phone carrier and it&#39;s not on their end it all started happening after the update, also certain apps lose connectivity even on wifi like voxer.
Here&#39;s an exciting <b>one</b><br><br>Haha
Made in Japan is good....
$1000.side mounted fingerprints scanner. Could be the most expensive phone yet. Pass.
Sony phones are to dam High they will be better at mid range like $700 and under with the plastic body then people will come maybe plus stuff in the box ok think Sony ok.
Well, my 4 year old XZ is starting to die so maybe this one should be next?<br>Deciding between this or the Galaxy S10.<br>Personally whichever one has best music capability which I will assume is sony?

Whatching this on my Sony Xperia 1 👍😁
I have the xperia 1.  Such an awesome phone.
And here I am I don&#39;t even have a 4k tv yet.
My All time  &quot;dream SONY Xperia&quot; mobile phone.. For me nothing compares to this Sony Xperia gorgeous phone. The moment you take a look, hold then touch on screen and do some exploring features, wow very smart and it&#39;s so genius.. From the color texture of phone cover, it&#39;s music digital sorround sounds and the camera will surely satisfied you. It&#39;s becoz, with SONY Xperia,  you&#39;ll probably be experiencing the very best  phone qualities and phone feature has to offer, it&#39;s the most diverse and A very captivated phone ever exist..
Good enough for 007, good enough for me.
Why it has terrible battery life?
Just done an update ...not happy my phone seems to be worse and the screen grab function is absolutely shocking as you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re grabbing...who would have thought from a world camera maker. 😤🇬🇧
The 16:9 and 21:9 are the most usual aspects. Most smartphones have the stupid 20:9 or 18:9.
I like that one
Sony camera is superb
The phone is tall like a camel 🐫 I love the screen dimensions of XA1Ultra.

I have a bad habit of losing my cellphones but THIS ONE! I will guard with my life🤺
3300mah on a 4K display? 🤣😅😂 Sony hasn&#39;t learned from their mistakes ... Xperia XZ Premium 2017 was a mistake on epic proportions even though it was the World&#39;s 1st 4K smartphone it also was the worst battery ever in a smartphone making it almost unusable with only 3320mah  and this one again only with 3300mah even worst battery than a phone that came out 3yrs.... which is laughable 🤣...I&#39;m shocked they didn&#39;t make it 5G ... if any1 trying to get this phone dont bother because battery is abysmal... and for $700 after a year released is still not worth it...
I want this phone.
Do you recommend this Smartphone and is $600 a great price point, for what it offers?<br>I know originally it was around $1,000 but I don&#39;t think it was really worth that 🤔
I have the xperia 1 in gray.... I love every bit of it EXCEPT the fingerprint scanner it&#39;s useless most of the time I have to type in my password, if it is even a little bit dirty or wet or if your finger is even a little clammy it doesn&#39;t work it is genuinly the worst part about the phone other than that it&#39;s great though
I Own Xperia XZ3<br>I Love the Oled Screen
Did sony make improvements to the battery on this device?
I love sony
I looked up 4K phone
Sir I like the phone but how long does battery last?
🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥<br>KURD☀️STAN<br>🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
I bought it and man, I couldn&#39;t have spent any better. I got it pretty cheap. Around $600 but no headphones. Though I only use it for watching anime. Not much of a difference. But sounds crisp to me.
Watching this from my Xperia 1 II
If you don&#39;t want to support Chinese governmeant or give your personal info to them, Sony is a great choice.
Note 10+ or xperia 1?
The iphone xs screen colours looks very yellowed. Like cigarette smoke stained.
Planning to buy a new phone but i&#39;m feeling confused what brand i should buy, there&#39;s a lot of mobile phone brand today.

MAONO PROFESSIONAL PODCASTING MICROPHONE @RfvU
Sony 👌🏻 better than samsung .. sony always reach the quality we want ..
Sony over in the corner quietly making the best phones in existence and telling no one.
Can i have this phone with iOS?
It would seem Sony is out of the cell phone game now, but I still bought this, just today as a matter of fact to replace my Z3 from 2014.
Wait a sec, they were giving the same headphones with the last years device? lol that makes Xperia 1 ii somewhat less desirable to me.
The camera on the phone is so shitty. It barely takes anything for the picture to be blurry. I have had older phones where it wasn&#39;t this bad
Sony Erricson Xperia was my first phone, amazing still holding on to it.  My other Samsung&#39; phones just seem like following,  SONY. You can&#39;t beat it. Waterproof  Shutter press is phononobal believe me. Its like a human camera lol. Omg Harmonized Vibration I&#39;m in love. Best sound too you had me at Sony ❤️
Xperia 1... Asus zenfone 6.... Mi mix alpha xiaomi and HUAWEI p40 of course...
Ok so 1 year on ,we now have the 2. And he’s saying the same things? Apart from  price and ? It’s pretty much the same. Right here to right of this screen he’s talking about ii. Where are all these phones going?
Anyone notice that dead pixel from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=567">9:27</a>?
I&#39;m doing the same and more with my lg g7 honestly I can&#39;t see the difference in video / image quality passed 1080p. This phone has a waaay better speaker and sound experience overall since it has a quad Dec so listening to music is literally insane,<br>Plus there&#39;s an app. On play store that&#39;s called button remap which can turn any button on your phone to do what you want so I turned my Google assistant button which is on the top BTW to a camera button, and I&#39;m doing all this on a phone that cost me 650 bucks less then what that thing would have cost me<br><br><br>But yea unbox therapy great vid as always. I appreciate the content 😊
Could be my new phone .
Made for the PROFESSIONALS not for the FOOLS
I feel sad, I bought it on launch but didn&#39;t get any headphones. Probably because I&#39;m in the UK. It&#39;s still best phone I&#39;ve ever owned.
Do you know where they are made ??
sony xperia arc s days broo
Wow it&#39;s weird compare to how he reacted to the Xperia 1 II. Like he forced to do a review on this. Didn&#39;t even care to turned on the Dolby Atmos on the Xperia when comparing sound with the Oneplus and Iphone and leave it sound bad for people
Xperia 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
❤❤❤❤❤❤
2019 soul with a 2017 design and a BC naming scheme.<br><br>Sony, Jesus Christ. Get your shit together already. Lay off the alcohol and go to rehab.
1st phone: Arc S - lost :(<br>2nd phone: Z (2014-present. 6 years and still using it as my work phone)<br>3rd phone: XZ Premium (2018-present. 2 years and still a beast. My personal phone)
Now the Xperia 1 Mark II filled all the gaps
Sony is the king of all companies. I love sony more than me
Sony review bamm Holly Molly
I had Xperia Z, and Dad had Z2 and Z5 Compact but both disappointing cameras considering they make the sensors in the iPhone and the Pixel. We&#39;ve both now moved to Google Pixel which I think takes some of the best if not best (depending on style you like). <br><br>This is the first Xperia to get my interest in a while so hope we see some positive reviews.<br><br>And if possible though it may be asking to much, please Sony sort out your naming scheme!
never seen you this excited in a long time for a mobile phone.
It is annoying when youtubers say they will review the device and then never follow up on it.
I&#39;m with Motorola now...but I&#39;ve always wanted a Sony smartphone. I wish I could afford the Sony Xperia 1 ii. :&quot;0
We want a Xperia 1 ii !
Apple- they’ll sell a dead rotten animal for 1000$, it’s the marketing that matters for success
Does it do email?
Can&#39;t wait for mark 2!
the battery really destroy that phone.. sucks
sony makes the nicest phone out there imo. love their products!
Ura little ghetto arentchu
Question for sony users:<br>How&#39;s the aftersales service and the reliability of the phones..? I heard a lot of negativity for their reliability..
Xperia series is like the Ferrari of mobile phones, sleek and stylish and yet super powerful. Though they need better marketing.
Xperia I mark 2. Make something about that.
i firmly believe the sony xperia 1 mark ii deserves your attention as well. ;)
Please do Sony xperia 1 mark ii Unboxing and camera test Bro
They ditch their trademark stereo speaker setup
Watching it on my Xperia 1..
Gonna have to give a review for the xperia 1 ii next time
If only tmobile sold it.
I&#39;m with Huawei but i may go for Sony soon to see how the Sony phones are! They seem very nice looking and i grew up with sony and playstation throughout my childhood (if you know what i mean)
Coming back and watching again and again just for SONY
I broke with the Sony phones due to there tv remotes design , still love old xperias xz1, xzs, xz lovvvvit
Sleekest tv remote
sony is underrated brand..they build the product with quality and hard to get broken..
This phone is bad tbh, in terms of battery life. That much pixels and a snapdragon 865. And just 3300mah Lmao. If it lasts 4hours it&#39;s crazy.
Sony can last!!!<br>My dream phone!!!!
Thing is everybody love sony, it got no hate at all, people just do not know about these phones, sony need to make its presence felt.
Please do unbox the Newest Flagship Sony DAP.
The 1st thing i notice, it still look like the last time i use a xperia phone, which is on 2014.
I still have my sony vibrator
After this, make review xperia PRO 5g after the phone release.
Hey please do a review on XPERIA 1 mk ii too 😊
Talk too much.
when will you be getting the Sony Xperia 1 Mark II??? im keeping an eye out for this one... cheers Guys!
This phone looked like a great flagship, it had a lot of potential for great sales and would be placed sony back on the map
Lew! You gonna check out the mark 2 of this phone when it drops??
sorry Sony , am still using my 2017 XZ1, and am not seeking to upgrade, you gave me enough advanced tech in that phone which is still advanced in 2020 compare to other phones, people only change their sony phone only when its  stolen, if not they can use it forever
I really hope we see a review of Sony Xperia Mark 2 ! from the specs they seem to have listened and improved everything, except refresh rate mabye. And i dont know why, but there are always only a few and from the big ones like zero people who review sony phones...
Sony xperia 1 mark 2
&quot;snapdragon 855&quot;<br>Me: its aready gonna be $700 above any realistic budget I have
number 1 product in my list
Please do a review on Xperia 1 mark 2
So hard to choose a phone these days,  as soon as you purchase one, another comes out so very quickly
Please please review sony Experia1 mark 2 when it release!!!
Sony makes premium products I have Sony speakers in my car and they have 365 Watts
Still Sony rules!
U r just perfect bro.<br>And ur unboxing and explaining breifly
Send it to me plzz
PLEASE REVIEW THE SONY XPERIA 1 MARK II 5G
a year later, bought this in the uk brand new for £408. id say thats a bargain
Finally, Sony use to make great Camara phones, the k800i in 2006 (3.2mp) the Satio at 12.1mp a few year later. <br><br>Now, this phone should give us great photos
Lew from all the Sony fans pls rev the Sony Xperia 1 Mark 2
i used sony w595 Sony, sony w350i, Sony Satio, Sony xperia mini pro &amp; sony xperia mini they all were amazing devices. Sony is my favorite brand as well. <br>also used a lot and lot other device of Sony  like Alpha 6300  and 2 or 3 other Sony cameras before. used TVs VCR VCD music systems PlayStation 2 walkman and more and more things which hard to put in comments. I hope Sony come back in phone and laptop market. <br>Missing Sony laptops
Sony xperia xa is still my best phone
Sony was at one point better featured than iphone and samsung combined.
There is no white color on the screen of other phones only sony
This sony design is soo sleek....i like it
sony xperia 1 mark 2 please
Is there any one watching this using the sony wh 1000xm3? Because I am.
Xperia 1 Mark II please
I love Sony phones...<br>I have Sony Xperia L1
The 2 is coming...
MUSIC  MOON  STUDIO JERMANUS  BRITTO RAJAN
I want the Xperia Pro.... but might have to settle for the Xperia 1 mark 2 depending on which is released first.... honestly, if they release the pro along side the 1 mark 2, I will buy the pro over the mark 2 for my use case.
I wish if Sony me sales regional manager<br>1st to do  all sales departments fired 😒
Apple doesn’t even include air pods pros with a over 1,000 dollar phone.
I bought it yesterday ( 7 sony xepria)
Watching this vid while waiting  Sony Xperia 1 and Sony Xperia 5 mark 2 to be release 🤣
Hey bro give me your Sony phone.I&#39;m poor man I have no money so I can&#39;t buy Sony mobile.01915079929 call me
I had sony xpreria z3 worst phone ever!
Stay away from Sony phones. The batteries are terrible and the software sucks. I had a Sony phone before and it will just shut down on its own even if the battery is not empty. It won&#39;t turn on unless you plug it in. It&#39;s really annoying, didnt even last 1 full year.
I love Sony and I&#39;ve been gaming on playstation since 2005 Ps2, Ps3 and Ps4 Pro true &quot;fanboy&quot; of the Ps4 exclusives &amp; partial exclusive games! Would never go on any other console or platform!<br><br>Had an Xperia Z3 before my TV is a Sony bravia and I&#39;m satisfied with every product especially gaming on Playstation user and gamer friendly personally I never had any problems with them thank god! ☺️☺️
I’m so on the verge of giving up Apple just for this 🥰
You forgot the storage room ram info
Xperia I mark 2 is coming. Please do something about that. 🙂.
I believe that these so-called Flagship phones are a waste of  hard-earned money.  I always go for a bang for a buck, and even if I had the money to buy a flagship phone I wouldn&#39;t, a fool and his money are soon parted.
I have the Xperia 1 and the battery life is shocking it&#39;s the same size battery as my old 1+5t it is really really bad
Watching with Xperia XZ1<br>..
Sony still makes ps4 that we all play
Melbourne represent!!
Xperia 1 ii is going to be the android phone that switches me from iOS permanently. Sony has given up on their phones, but all they need to do is try, and they will dominate the android world. Best camera team in the world (imagine a sony phone that is essentially an alpha mirrorless.) great audio and display team. <br>They added the headphone jack back, upgraded the battery....looks like the perfect phone IMO.
Sony Xperia was the first to introduce AR camera I miss my Sony
had to get an s20 as nz mobile providers dont get sony =(
Come on man send me this phone if you have a big heart if you don&#39;t then I unsubsidised your chanel please send me please 😊<br>I&#39;m a big fan of Sony
Watching on that phone with the headphones
Which smartphone are you using sir???
The name Xperia makes phone superior!
Sony are for LEGENDS 😋<br>LG are for rich 😉💵<br>Huawei are for hustlers 😫<br>Oppo are for gold diggers 😓<br>HTC are for give-ups 😖<br>Samsung are for bragging people 😛<br>IPhone are for ego people 😚<br>Tecnos and infinix are for broke! 😏<br>  buıʎl ʇou ɯ,ı<br>😒😒😒
Eeeee
SHAME you for promoting china products in this corona epidemic time
a prominent Z2 owner for 5 years and continuing as backup phone. And using XA performance for 2 years. Underrated.
In 2017 I decided to buy a new flagship smartfone because my xperia m4 aqua was a bit old that day and I really want to have a new flagship device... After many days of searching I found many good comments about Xperia XZpremium. Unfortunately it was sold in every shop in my city so i bought Xperia XZ1 as its almost the same as XZ premium and i really enjoyed it for 2 years. In 2019 i found Xperia 1 on Black friday with price of 550 euro so I get into my car and went to buy it. Now I&#39;m happy owner of Xperia 1 and my mom also enyoing my old XZ1 which I gave to her. After few months using it i can say that its really nice smartphone, especially love watching 21:9 movies on it and recording video&#39;s with cinema pro. I also have collection of all the old srs series bluetooth speakers - xb 10, 20, 30, 40 and gtk xb 60 which I&#39;m using when doing small parties as a Dj with my friends somewhere outside. Love Sony divices since i was a kid and bought my first Sony Ericsson k750i phone like 15 years ago... Never disappointed me.
Small battery for the large screen.
Sony engineers invented an invisibility cloak! That&#39;s why you can&#39;t find their phones anywhere.
Too bad this phone will get next to zero carrier support. Sony lays so low they were named limbo champion--every year since they launched Xperia.
Had a Sony phone my freshman year of college.  It was definitely the most durable phone I&#39;ve ever owned! Made it through a whole year of blacked out partying lol
Please do a review on sony xperia 1 ii
i dont like the bezels it makes the phone look like its from 2017
Both Sony and OnePlus are best performers,soyy laggy( compared to them) - Iphone
Even in a YouTube video, I can see how great that screen is.
I can&#39;t wait for Lew to Unbox the new version of Xperia 1.... I&#39;m pretty sure Lew will be amaze by the camera on that smartphone. Anyway Stayhome Staysafe. Peace😁
This or LG G8s for same price?
4K HDR with 3300mAh? This thing must die too fast
Who&#39;s watching this with Vivo phone😅
imagine writing in landscape on this phone
I like sony more than samsung now, samsung is a copycat i hate that.
Please get your hands on the Xperia 1 mark ii !!!! :)
The question im just asking is, can it play heavy games like PUBG, Honkai Impact 3, Fortnite (only an example, i do not play it and never will) without losing too much fps?
Try sony xperia 1 mark 2 now
Yeah bro
What i don&#39;t like about sony is that screen color is on blueish side. It hurt my eye when using it on midnight while on bed. Unlike Samsung the screen is more  yellowish warm good for the eye on midnight.
I&#39;ve had my Xperia zv3 for 3 years. I&#39;m happy with it.  Can&#39;t wait to get the new one
Wonder why Sony phone suck in audio..
Wait it has the same settings as a dslr😯
Sony is great electronic company
I have been a fan of Sony for years
I miss my first experia Go 😣
Can you unbox Xperia 1 ii ?
Love from India😘😘😘😘😘😘
Please Lew, do a Sony Xperia 1 II review. We want to know how the camera compare to the other flagship. It is rumored to have the best autofocus

give a look to the new xperia one mark II looks promising, seems like they fixed everything they got wrong last year
Pls try a infinix smartphone
Sony needs better naming
Gotta love Sony
Make a video about Xperia 1 mark2 and Xperia 1 Pro 5g
I&#39;ve been using the xperia smartphones since 2012 untill I switched to the 11 pro...I&#39;ve gotta say that Sony makes awesome products and they will always have a special place in my heart
These device feel too long.
Admit it or not but XS reigns at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=515">8:35</a>!
Sony phone + Purple color=<br>🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Love the look of these phones. Looking forward to the Mk2 coming out soon!
Discussing sony

For Tmobile?
India price
When India launch

Hi<br><br>Hi
This phone is very costly in Pakistan.
Damn this phone is nice.
ive had my xperia z3 for 5 years and i want to upgrade, but verizon sadly doesnt support anything besides the z3v and xz2
I think the xperia one&#39;s a little too big. I&#39;m considering the experia 10 mark 2  coming up. Any thoughts on people with the experia 10? Or the original xperia 1?
Theres a new xperia phone
Time to review the mark ii
Love that! 😘
Sony is an iconic brand i love Sony.
I loved my Sony xz premium, first 4K smartphone screen, Sony’s products always look good
I see Xperia 1 as the king of all flagships 💯
Dead upon arrival... unfortunately
Dude..u should look up into SONY XPERIA 1 MARK II for unboxing. Kind of   same funtion with profesional camera.
Best parts of the device are, (though there are several other exclusive things) they, Sony, still keeps some Bezel (I think bezels are saviors for the display from a good drop) , and all the cameras are 12-12-12 MP - - no kind of, 48-13-5, or hundreds of megapixels...
They never bring software update on time and design are outdated.
Can&#39;t wait for you to review the Xperia 1 Mark II Pro!
Mi mix alpha
4k phone well can we play 🎮 4k games on it, obviously no ???
Haha the dedicated shutter button it was ages back in the Nokia N8, 808 ,1020 n the Microsoft 950
Do one for experia 1 ii pleaseee
3k batt? :(
Such a paid review
No,yeah, no
You should check out the new sony xperia 1 mark 2👑🔥🔥🔥
Best of Sony in a long time. Would like a come back, retired his smartphones line in lots of countries.
Is this a good buy at $560?
What&#39;s that watch you&#39;re wearing?
i had own experia z1 to z3 till samsung made a better camera phone. with stylus. yup note fan here. anyway love the dedicated camera button from sony. and the screen. but for camera is really important. sony camera phone really sux
Xperia’s used to be the game changers back then before 4 or 3 years!!
Mark II update! Would love to see a Xperia 1 II/Pro vs. iPhone 11/Pro 💪🏽
Sony computers and laptops.
Amazing sony best mobile
ill never get a sony phone in my life again ... their privacy policy is shit ...
Sony has always had shutter button and half down to take picture.  Great video on awesome phone
Headphone bad diya Power bank dee
Sony’s phones and tvs are one of the most reliable products out there.
X1-mark 2 judt dropped! Review it asap please! That phone needs attention it way better than s20 ultra i think.
Doing both management &amp; IT in my uni, it&#39;s just painful how Sony is behind on the marketing. Good marketing is like propaganda, no matter how the product is, good or bad, you&#39;ll get people with it. I miss the cool Bond ads my Bond phones had, Xperia T and Xperia Z5. It made people notice them, especially the T. Sony is associated with quality as I noticed, both in my studies and life. They just need a proper push and their phones will sell better. Most of the current top phone brands are so high up is because the marketing
Can you please send one to me in India.. no sale in India 😪😪😪
Please unbox the sony Xperia 1 II
Get sony xperia 1 Mark II in your hands ASAP bro 🙏
As a former Sony phone user, Sony phones suck shit
Beauty smartphone ever
I love that purple
Apple: Hey all<br>Samsung: Wassup<br>Huawei: Hello guys<br>Google: Hi everyone<br>OnePlus: Who the fuck is that guy?<br><br>Sony has left the chat.
Sony the real Apple! Sony are doing it in headphones and DAPS and cameras and TVs still anything with imaging... TVs  its between Samsung and LG and Sony and Sony is still recommended over the 2 in premium.... they are lagging behind in phones though but i guess they have a PR marketing problem in their phone dept.... from what i hear their phones are awesome proper functionality and innovation werent they the first to be proper waterproof at one time with the only physical shutter button too
Only sony&#39;s 4k hdr display and music app 💖🤘
Pls review part 2 of this phone 🙏🙏
Still not up to the mark...we in asia have lot more better smartphones than this with 3.5nm audio jack<br>And who needs a damm 4k...and funniest thing is it has 3300Mah battery 😂<br>Rip battery life
look like old Samsung phone....<br>s8
Xperia 1 Mk.2 is up
Please do a Sony Xperia 1 mkII unboxing, whenever you do get your hands on one. Personally I&#39;ve been using the Xperia1 for about 9 months now and think the new lineup of phones are one of the most underrated, and underappreciated. Sony needs Samsung / Apple style Marketing to get on top.. just like their camera division.
Next up the mark 2?
The new Sony Xperia 1 II is literally the most perfect phone ever made!
The problem with sony is the name of the phone shit I cant remember all that
This is what I get for looking up Sony Xperia 1mark ii smh
The sharp square corners so ugly just like the Samsung Note
i have a few sony phones like xa1 but i started to dislike the newer designs...i don&#39;t know why but i just don&#39;t like the back camera to be in the center.
So he did not play with the Dodlyspeaker settings pluse he put the phone in the mid of 2 other phone to make the volume louder what kind of review is this so much for its what i dohis just trying to sell the product not review it paid forby sony😂
Xperia 1 mark 2, please...
This pops up onmy  youtube search for mark ii which mistakenly think it is until saw it that it was 7 months ago 😅😅😅
With the screen resolution+sd855. I wonder how long itll gonna last with that mediocre 3000mah battery. I dont hate it though. Looks nice honestly. Something different.
Could you check out the Xperia 1 MKII 😁
sony made the first foldable tablet .. am i right??
sony has so weak batteries .... and they have very bad phones my xperia got laggy and slow after three months and samsung grand neo 2 works well even today ... so what can i say im dissapointed with sony .
they are just about to launch the next Xperia and I literally cant wait to see it
The ppi is insane
iPhone user here,I think this looks cool..thinking of changing over
I don&#39;t know why but there&#39;s always something about Sony&#39;s styling. They&#39;re just the king of classiness when it comes to design. Understated elegance is what they manage to pull. Maybe not always but it&#39;s something few other manufacturers can pull off.
My first Android phone was a Sony Xperia Sola back in 2012. Still works to this day but being Android 2.3 it&#39;s slower than paint drying. Mauve I&#39;ll go with Sony again next time but it&#39;s hard to resist all the other great-value-for-money phones from Huawei, Realme, Reemi, Xiaomi, Honor, Oppo, and Vivo (those last two aren&#39;t really great value compared to the others I mentioned but they&#39;re not that bad either). Sony needs to make some noise if they wanna keep playing in the smartphone market but I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re gonna exit soon.
The only reason my phone has never been stolen is because it&#39;s a sony
Love Sony, but I&#39;ll wait till they get the fucking headphone jack back!!
The screen-to-body ratio is disappointing.
I had a Xperia...And to be honest...It was incredible...
sony really has the worst screen ever
Is it worth to upgrade from XZ PREMIUM?
Finaly Sony is back ❤️
Sony definitely have the best looking Android phones, but the UX experience was eh... Been using 2 Sony phones since their first name on Xperia S, then the waterproof Xperia Z. Not went well, phone got slow, heat... Many problems.
Now only if Samsung could catch up that would be great lol
I had the z5 premium and i was not impressed. Hopefully this one is better.
I own the xz 2 and my God I&#39;ve been in love with Sony phones since 2015 with the xz premium. Also really want the xperia one. Ugh I&#39;m just in love with there cameras as well.
3300mAh Battery?<br>That&#39;s poor....<br><br>Written on my 4200mAh P30pro
My next one after Xperia XZ Premium, l love Sony Xperia
Sony xz3 please
Looks kinda outdated and hard to hold. Sony really need to innovate to get ahead. That’s why they’re not selling anymore.
Watching from my Sony Xperia 1 phone... awesome phone!!!
I dont even have a phone!!!!
I still think it&#39;s crazy that a phone can cost a grand
Xperia... Best phone series ever built.. I never was disappointed with them! And I work on a rough place
Who also cleaning their mobiles after watching this? 😂
My next smartphone is this for sure with TCL stopping support for my BlackBerry Motion in 2022 (hopefully the price will drop by then).
I&#39;m a big Sony fanboy, I got a bunch of Sony products but I was very disappointed with this phone.
This phone has more buutons than my controller😂
Sony has what it takes to completely dominate the world of high-end smartphones.  This is not their best, but it&#39;s something.  I just know they can do much better.  I&#39;ve been with Sony since about 1994, and everything I&#39;ve ever owned by them has been top-notch.  My friend and I used to say if Sony made shoes, we&#39;d buy them.
Proud 10 plus user
The xperia play was way cooler and now that phones are way stronger they could make it amazing with the built in controller and since its Sony licensor for PlayStation wouldn&#39;t be a problem.
So.... How do you watch 4k video quality on mobile? For example I have a S10+ and I&#39;m at home so I have good wifi connection, every single video on YouTube has a maximum display resolution option of 720p even if the video is uploaded in 4k (which I&#39;m able to verify on PC)
Hey I sold my Sony Xperia xz3 and now xperia 1 love it my old sony&#39;s are xperia x compart and xperia xz 1 and xperia xz Premium 4k and xperia xz 1 agen and xperia xz2 and xperia xz3 and now xperia 1 4k only sony&#39;s 4k 😍✌️👍
Superb smartphone
watching this video on my one plus 7 pro 👻
Watching on my experia 1
Can Sony make a new Xperia play model please?
I&#39;m Indian <br>I  love you  Sony
JAPANESE SUPERIOR QUALITY BUT I THINK ISN&#39;T ENOUGH TO BE THE #1 BUT IF SONY FINALLY LAUNCH THE SONY XPERIA NOTE FOLDABLE IT WILL CRUSH THE COMPETITION I WILL PAY AT LEAST U$D1200 FOR THE BASE MODEL
Love it!
sony still lags behind in price to performance ratio
XPERIA NEVER AGAIN.
I cannot buy Sony because it has larger price In my country
I really don&#39;t like the &quot;candy bar&quot; slimness a lot of smartphones are doing these days I actually like my phone to have a little width
Still it&#39;s not in middle east
Do Realme X2 Pro
I LIKE SONY  FaTher I LiKe SoNY
- Still own an Xperia S from 2012 and works great
I don&#39;t beleive in Sony phones anymore..<br>I gave 3 chances with 3 phones for the sake of loving Sony, and I just got disappointed everytime
As always, Sony focusing on stuff that doesn&#39;t matter...4k on a screen this size is nothing more than a battery waster, battery that&#39;s already weak enough alone. And as always it&#39;ll be overpriced.
Review xperia 5
I want this phone
These headphones are amazing but i can&#39;t afford them 😭🎧
Sony should bring back Xperia Ultra design
Well its made from japan
Sony still the best for me.
this is a compact big phone.<br>a big phone with compact phone handling.<br>i like it..<br><br>i even still have my Xperia X1..
Do on acer predator helios 300 2019
Bought one from music magpie for 350
I love sony phones... They have a great camera quality... Even back in button keypad days...
I just bought one today. Had an I phone 7 but got bored of iPhone
was this the only xperia you reviewed? ??
Had a Sony Xperia was a great phone until the charging port wouldn’t take a charge after 6 months
Ridiculously the best flagship... Wish it&#39;s available in India
The reason that the power button and the fingerprint scanner are seperate, could be that, when you press the button your fingerprint get deformed, just a little bit, but enought for the scanner not to be able to read your fingerprint. Just my conclusion.
Ohh for the record , Sony LDAP bluetooth codec can play 24 bit / 96khz audio without compression . Best bluetooth codec out there for music . APTX - HD aint worthy
Showing Melbourne on the 21:9 video example :)
Xperia z3 plisssss
Watching on the xperia 5. The best of 2019
I love tall, narrow phones, <br><br><br>If I ever went Android, I&#39;d go Sony for sure
One thing that everybody is missing on this phone is the screen is nice the Samsung note 10+ I think the screen is just as nice disowning the only thing that kills the Sony Xperia one is the sound it’s got the worst sound coming out of the cell phone I’ve ever heard it’s terrible for music it’s terrible from movies it has zero bass in it sounds disgusting otherwise I would buy this phone<br><br>When you listen to the note 10+ next to the Sony Xperia one and you play music and movies it’s no contest I mean no contest the Samsung note 10 plus destroys the Sony as far as sound goes
SONy..😍😍😍😍
Sony marketing department should be replaced, they are really worst in the world.<br>It is innovative company unlike others..
Sony had the first side mounted fp sensor
Our tv is still the Trinitron
i love sony. i have their TV (we have 3 Sony TV`s in &quot;my&quot; house) i have playstation (but i play on PC nowdays), all my phones have been sony´s (okey my first phone was LG but...) and if i would need headphones to normal use i would get Sony´s headphones
This might be fixed now. But i had a sony phone and it had serious heat problems and the charger barely worked. So based off that i will not buy a sony phone, but these might be fixed so i am not telling that you shouldn&#39;t buy one
The fingerprint scanner on the side was always the best location for it...
I need this phone been looking at it awhile. I got the XA2 Ultra when I came out. Loved that phone. Sony phones. Xbox consoles.
take dat hair off ur phone...
I&#39;ve had my Xperia XZ Premium for two years now and it&#39;s still great! No issues 😂
Please make an update
wildmaknae_  true thatt..using xperia since am 15..about 12 years u have 6 xperia uncluding xperia 1..the first phone i bought it about 12 years ago work like a charm..never serviced..only changed the battery once.yes sony is underated..but it is the best quality and tuned android phone till date♥️
I am curious to know what does he do with all these smartphones he gots after every unboxing
I dont have anything against the phone, but you&#39;ve had all the same settings on the camera in samsung phones since for awhile
Do an A50 video
I love this phone. Just wish you could charge it wirelessly.
The Design, Interface, Exclusive SONY Applications, Look &amp; Feel, Unique Features (Fingerprint on Side, Light Bar, Dynamic Vibration)<br><br>BRILLIANT!!!<br><br>For The PROFFESSIONAL&#39;S
This is the purest aesthetical beauty. A truly stunning, sleek, minimalistic design. Nothing beats Sony here, absolutely nothing. l still have an old chocolate bar Xperia XZ1 and it&#39;s beauty is simply gorgeous. ln a flood of today&#39;s generic design I hear some people moan and rant about Sony staying behind times for stubbornly sticking to their own path. The thing couldn&#39;t be more opposite. Their design actually exceeds a question of time. Because its aesthetical value is , simply, timeless.
Just got the Razer gaming phone 2. Loving it.
What if he did a drop test after each unboxing😃😅
Sony needs to improve its marketing area plus its batteries because 4k screens are power hungry 3330maH is literally nothing for 4k it won&#39;t hold up a full day
Please unbox more sony smartphones because i really wanna know how good they are now since i had xperia z3 are they better from you&#39;re opinion if so i m gonna buy the latest so Please unbox the Latest sony xperia smartphone . Grtz from belgium 🙂
Sony since day 1
The XPERIA Z2 I had never gave a single complaint in 5 years of use. That happened neither with Samsung nor oneplus. Sony quality is top notch.
Why hire a dumbass to do the unboxing?
Who else is a team samsung but had sony as their first smartphone
Can you play Fifa 20 on this Phone?
Wow. The one plus sounds like shit
They need to bring back the headphone jack
I think sony is the father always
This phone&#39;s software pretty bad in service worth inside of shithole
Sony Xperia 4 life
another trash ! y am i not surprised ?!
I&#39;m just hoping for a budget Sony phone..
&quot;its way more pixels than my eyes could ever discern&quot;
Good phoned
This is the perfect phone for cinema junkies
POLL CULTURE <br>like this is I should buy the Xperia 1 for a bundle or not wait and hope the price of just the phone goes down
3330 mah well..........not soo good with a very good screen......1 year later half day the battery go to 0 per cent.........
Do you get to keep the phones you unbox
Who has Xperia t2 ultra dual
Would love to buy one of your old phone as an upgrade for me
At first i didnt know what name of sony im using right, but i find out it was XZ men, haha so excited. Got it from my birthday, my first language isnt english sorry. But so proud with SONY.
Watching thuis with a experia10
Sony’s marketing on phones suck ass.<br><br>I see all of these ps4 video game ads and promotions in like GameStop or Best Buy but Sony just let a 4K hand held display just to get glossed over.<br><br>Like seriously, I didn’t even know Sony made phones before I decided to search up “4K phone” on YouTube for no reason at all besides just for fun.
Sony deserves your attention for the wrong reasons at the moment. Poor camera and poor battery life on the Xperia 1 is not acceptable. Hope they fix the next generation with the simple let downs as they are crucial
I don&#39;t recommend
I love sony.. i am only sony lover &amp; user
Sony is the best
I wish i could buy this Phone
Dang better than iphones
You should&#39;ve done an sony xz premium review
Can anyone tell me if this phone will work with Australian network providers (telstra, voda, optus etc)
Watching from sony xperia z5 premium. Im proud of my sony even thought people around me using iphone.
Dedicated shutter button is great.
Sony products have generally let me down
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=238">3:58</a><br>As a Sony smartphone user for a decade i was like:  O.o wut..
Long phone is long.  But it seems like everything is just a slightly updated xz premium.  I like smaller phones.  But the premium was too long.<br><br>I like that they kept the 4k pixel density though.
It’s cool , it’s exclusive ... but it’s not PRO device
Greetings from singapore, i&#39;m a samsung user but this phone looks awesome
I’m an iPhone guy, but if someday I decide to go with Android, Sony will be my choice without a doubt!
does it have wireless charging?
no  use  ... waist  of money.... if glass broken  Sony service center reject to repair it... their phones sending to local repair center fake sparepart ..what is this.. worldwide repair tragedy
I Definitely think the Experia 1 is,  Sonys best and sleekest. Phone yet . I haven&#39;t had much luck recently, in some of my new upgrades especially for sound . Cause I love good decent sound and bass , on today&#39;s smartphones it&#39;s a must and. This beauty I have a good feeling to make . This my next new upgrade , could be the Android phone to my prayers 🙏 lol
Xz2 user here and now saving money to buy this 😍
I&#39;m watching this on my Sony Xperia 5 2019 🙃
My Xperia 5 premium doesn’t work with T-Mobile ,works amazing under WiFi and my Bluetooth speaker sounds amazing ,can’t go wrong with Sony ,you can take pics out of this world,camera is an art piece
I like sony but i dont like batery not save 😠
They&#39;re just so expensive
Sony is a truly inspirational brand and I&#39;ve owned everything sony all my life including every version of Xperia until just this year because it has always been unreliable and I couldn&#39;t take it anymore!  No wonder they are giving away headphones.  Seems to me I&#39;m the only one from the comments, but I find that hard to believe.
Iphone
i love sony i must say android runs on sony phones so fluent no laggs nothing and updates allways fast smartphone users should give sony a chance im usong the new xperia 5 its feels very good to in hand
Golf 2
I would really love to buy this phone....it looks sexy and rigid.....but that price really just blows me away...sorry Sony
Sony xperia xz premium have 800+ppi
Too expensive for no reason... No chance on this market
Hey. Can you do a review on the Motorola g7 power, zoom and action. Thanks
This is funny I just bought this phone. It&#39;s awesome for what I need. Have had it for two weeks and it&#39;s awesome, in my opinion. I&#39;m enjoying my experience...
I just miss the Walkman Music Player on the Xperia
Feeling nostalgic!<br>I remember getting my first Xperia
MOTO ONE ACTION
You never tried xperia XZ PREMIUM
i used to love sony phones...then they let me down..!!!!
Guys , if you’re gonna buy a phone for the display, don’t get the Xperia 1. While it’s 4K display might be nice, it’s practically pointless on a smartphone. The Xperia has disappointing contrast and not the best brightness which is crucial for HDR. Any of these phones easily beat the Xperia in terms of display quality: Samsung s10/s10+/s10 5G. Note 10+ and iPhone 11 Pro and pro max.
samsungbifbgive mebthat hehehe
samsungbifbgive mebthat hehehe
Fuck yeah
Yo, that phone is legit! I&#39;ve been stuck on getting a Pixel 4...but now, now I think I may consider jumping off the Google Platform bandwagon. The Purple, OMG, that gets me all the way. What kind of protection support will be available as far as cases? Also, something I have really enjoyed about the Google Pixel line of phones is how strong their glass screen actually is. I have chosen to not use an additional glass screen protector on my 2 and 3. How good is the glass on the Xperia? <br>Awesome review, thanks guys!
Sony xperia is thE best
I have one. It&#39;s a beautiful smart phone. It looks amazing and coming from using a Sony Xperia Z, it&#39;s nice to see an almost completely stock android interface. It has great cameras, it has a beautiful screen and the aspect ratio is super useful when browsing websites, reddit, etc. However, I am slightly disappointed. I have had it 1 week tomorrow and I have 1 small problem: the finger print sensor is stupid inaccurate. It does not work 6/10 times. I don&#39;t know if i did something wrong here but i have 5 finger prints registered to it (use case scenario) and it is POOR. The placement is good, it is great because naturally when getting my phone out of my pocket, i will have my thumb in that position anyway. However, it is useless if it doesn&#39;t work. Furthermore, the battery life is a very simple &quot;OK&quot; it&#39;s not astounding and it isn&#39;t terrible. It&#39;s just OK.<br><br><br>Love the phone but at the moment, it&#39;s slightly disappointing when I end up spending £850 on this phone to have a finger print sensor that is so bad. However, given the screen, the beautiful construction, the SD card slot and the hefty amount of storage as standard (128gb), I&#39;m going to stick with it. I know that Sony can make great phones and they have an excellent track record when it comes to personal devices. I have faith.
Who says that you need notch and pop up camera to achieve almost bezeless display
10 minute video<br><br>Only 1 minute passes on phone
XZ1 compact successor never ever
Best looking in a while
I just got mine last week. This phone is amazing.
Let&#39;s be honest, sony make shitty phones and that&#39;s it. I used to be a Sony phone user, and they were just crap.
which brand your watch?
I’m a fan of Sony since I got the PSP and played the PS4, I love everything about sony. I have the Sony tv 📺, I have the psp and the ps4, Sony headphone, and I have an xperia.
That&#39;s not a Walkman. That&#39;s a discman.
Bogus bull shit
Is it Water-Resistant? Thanks 😊
The only thing is im broke
I want that phone for christmas!
Looks pretty cool but my biggest problem with the new androids is how skinny they are. They look like tv remotes
trash phone
😯😯
Nokia and Sony cant catch up market now .. Doesn&#39;t matter if how good phone they build...  They used to be best but in today&#39;s date and in future.. mobile business are over for these two companies
Uboxing sony Xperia 5
What?? Xperia is alive again?? R.I.P soon rest well Xperia 👍👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=390">6:30</a> Sound Effects : 100
I wish Sony&#39;s Product naming scheme would be simpler, I mean, i own the XZ Premium for like, 2 years if not more, but the new phone names are so confuzing - XZ3, Xperia 5, Xperia 10, Xperia 3, and then the 1...
I have had samsung phones for 14 years now. This is the only phone I would want to switch to from my s8. But I want a headphone jack
Battery disappoints
Sony makes world&#39;s best phone and comes always with something new but sadly underrated , may be because of lack of marketing or else.
Might switch to this tbh
shiti phone
They need to lower the price by at least 130$ and get a better marketing team.
Where&#39;s the review? Did you switch to this?

naw man, audio goes to iPhone with Sony and OnePlus subpar. If you used the options available to you the Sony can be tweaked to sound as good. I don&#39;t think OnePlus does. LG V50 is coming.
The only reason I know about this phone is because of &quot;The Boys.&quot; Lmao, I noticed they had some cellphone that was not your typical iPhone or Android
I&#39;m watching on Xperia XZ Premium, going to upgrade to the Xperia 1. Love Xperia&#39;s
Camera dedicated button? Kinda reminded me of my K-series Cybershot Sony Ericsson phone
4k screen with a 3300 mah battery.<br><br><br>thats a no from me
Make video of nokia 9 pureview
I&#39;ve never owned a Sony time to take a chance currently using huawei
Have mine since July and it’s a great phone! The MX headphones are amazing.
Sony phones are very underrated. They have actually innovated several firsts that the others have copied. Hope Sony can finally get their damn head in the game when it comes to their phones and turn it around.
Sony....Like no other !
sd card? straight to my list
what a ugly phone
I bought this phone for 200$ in an official shop...
I bought an Xperia arc s in 2012.<br><br>it become a backup phone in 2015.<br><br>i loaned it to my brother 2016, it went through hell with him for 2 years. <br><br>He returned it with a third of the backside paint worn, scrapped and chipping off. The frame was cracked in 2 places but still holding together. It only charges when the micro usb is pusher in at a specific angle. The battery takes 6 hours to fully charge and it lasts 3 hours of screen on time.<br><br>but it still works.<br><br>Had a Z ultra for a year but it was stolen.<br><br>Sony phones are gr8, the best for a while but they went off to the far premium end and fell behind.
3100 mah battery in 2019! LMAO....
The xperia is so slept on they are reliable and they are quick cant wait to get mine xperia one.
I need that right now give it to me pleaaaaase🙏🙏
Despite all that, Sony withdrew from most markets. They can&#39;t even afford to operate anymore. How will they come back?
Great review two thumbs up!!!! now I just have to save for it......
I&#39;ve been waiting, this one seems a bit more interesting.
Nobody seems to like Sony phones until they see you owning a Sony phone. Happened to me more than once with my XZ1
Loooong phone
I still have my sony xperia z ultra
You do have a tool to open it, it&#39;s US, were the tools, lol.
Essential previewed a very narrow new phone, 29 by 9 screen, i think it was that size. lol.
Sony makes premium phones, but they peeved me off, by cutting off Android 9 and 10 update to my new xperia XA1 Ultra phone. I called HO, they said straight forward it was a management decision, not to include it, basically, frak off customer. So i will be extra careful buying sont phone again.
Wait the power button and the finger scanner isn&#39;t the same button?? That&#39;s a really weird move. My xz premium is all in one.
There&#39;s no difference between the iPhone 11 and a regular display<br>270 ppi vs 640<br>iPhone 11 vs this shit
Nokia 9
I upgraded from google nexus 6p<br>To xperia xz premium.<br><br>The 6p was better in every single aspect.<br><br>When you fill the storage on the xpiria to over 80% the phone will crash to several hours before coming back to life again.<br><br>The phone is comparably slower than phones with older processors.<br><br>The camera sucks.<br><br>Home page bugs all the time.
I had an Xperia, and over time it&#39;s screen stopped working. Gradually and over time the whole screen became unusable.<br><br><br>Looking at forums it seemed as if it was a manufacturer&#39;s defect and Sony was ducking everything and didn&#39;t want to know about it.<br><br><br>Since then I have never bought another Sony product and never will again.
says walkman, shows discman lol...I know Walkman became a brand but you know...
Xperia was my favorite line for a long time. Then the self cracking issue started to appear, and sony said fuck off, not our fault it&#39;s user error. Nope.
It doesn&#39;t have &#39;&#39;clear all&#39;&#39; button, it has Home button, Back button, but not that one which is the best when you are multitasking :&#39;(
If it played ps4 games it would be must buy.
Hmmm I think I still want to get  ROG 2, 6000 battery and 6.65 screen and overclocked chip
i miss sony laptops
Xperia 1 sure
Sony mobile is hot while running
My brother used xperia z5 premium dual for so long.. infact we still have it.. my brother is missing sony so bad cuz it’s not releasing any phones here :’) he’s like “I’ll buy it now if sony releases a phone” and he was thinking of getting one shipped here.. but now he just went with a 11 pro-
The dedicated camera button is not new in Xperia. They&#39;re using it for how many years already 😁 and XZ Premium has 807ppi. so it&#39;s not new in Xperia hahaha
It doesent deserve my attention is bad always will be never gonna buy xperia again
Song the best<br>Xbox sucks!!!
What about the Xperia 5, any chance it&#39;ll get covered on Unbox Therapy? I&#39;d love to see your take on it.
Absolutely love this phone 🤯🤯
I currently have XA1  but having multiple issues with it I lost the mood to go for another Sony phone.
Getting this badboy tomorrow. Literally too excited to sleep, lol. I&#39;m so happy to be going back to an Xperia handset!!
3330 mAh battery... SONY... GET SERIOUS! 👎
1 week later i am watching on my Sony Xperia 1. Loving it.
I wish other companies used different software besides android
Sony best phone tamilnadhu
from having xperia 1 for 6 months - battery life is about half what it used to be already, games are very jumpy and crash a lot, GPS is terrible for using any sort of map. Its cheap but runs cheap.
Not a big fan of Sony devices.. the battery life on their devices is horrible and  but I&#39;m trying to adopt to their devices because it&#39;s Sony
I think that xperia just went downhill and kept rolling down
Go Xperia 5 and switch already. Everyone has seen/used/heard about iPhones and OnePluses and Samsungs. Show us something that is really new!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=537">8:57</a> Lew&#39;s iPhone got jaundice after seeing the other two phones 😉
Too expensive!
Will it work boost mobile cdma?
How to fix mine. I can&#39;t install games it says full storage
5th Xperia in my hand, soon 6th.
This phone is long
Starting up from Sony (cellphone then smartphone), tried an iPhone (for the camera and iTunes), get an OnePlus (admittedly hype), switched to Samsung (great specs on paper), and finally... coming back home for Sony.
Once you go for xperia there is a risk you may fall for it and never think of other brands
Price?
Damn! this phone is so underrated
Soo Sony Xperia XZ4?
Dude I already know this is gonna be good but OPEN IT! 😐
watching this with my xperia xz😅omg i want it
my xperia t2 ultra a budget phone ultra from 2014 can still keep up with these chinese and midrange phones..<br>right now im planning for an upgrade to xperia 1..im still saving money
Notch-less is better than Bezel-less. 😤
Please do an impression on Xperia 5 and maybe switching to it as daily driver. I want to know your opinion about it. Thank you!
I miss Sony phone. It&#39;s long lasting, unbreakable...
Sony foldable &quot;playphone&quot; !?!
Hi😊<br>After unboxing that phone, what is your plan, what are you going to do?? (Can I???)😊😊😊😊😂
You Say IT with you&#39;re mouth, the pixel density is so high on the Phone even the human eye can&#39;t see IT.
Try the dolby atmos with headset
Sony was the king but not no more
Even though the Xperia is 4K, the Note 10 Plus still has a far better display. Insane brightness for true HDR, more accurate colors and it can display more colors. Things will look better on the note 10 plus
From where can I buy this phone
Far too much bezel in this era
Can I have the Xperia 1?
Way too big....
&quot;Humans BOOM&quot; ☺
Sony is a good brand of cellphone but until now they dnt have fullscreen display??? And the unit become hot during long time used🤣
4k 21:9 video link plz
All phones should be 21:9 tbh
Snoy is back
The Experia-1 will be my next📱phone.I&#39;m still running the LG V-20 currently,it&#39;s suppose to get the 9.0 pie upgrade this month.
Ihad sony xperia too
I have a Xperia model that I bought like 5 years ago. The thing fell hard on the ground a handful of times. The screen still looks perfect aside from small scratches.<br>Definitely gonna buy another Xperia next, I dont see any reason to buy another model to be honest. Sony products never disappointed me.
sony just makes anything except mobiles , garbage mobile phones
How do you become  a tester
I&#39;m going back to Sony
sony needs to replace &quot;xperia&quot; thing...find any other cooler names just sony its enough..sony is a legendary brand it represents a high quality
Sony Xperia 5 Come Out !
Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha Pleasee
Unfortunately its shit iv got it dont buy it
Sony phones are the most reliable, well thought out featured phones out there. But is sadly underrated
I want it 🙁😫 it my favorite color but I cant afford it damn
Now we need for xperia 5
Can someone tell me why iPhone x/xs owners my friends always tell me to take their pic on my LG G8 and Xperia 1.....  👍🏻👍🏻 some people got it
combine one plus 7pro with Xperia 1 and boom you have the best display ever.
Gaming on the sony xperia 1! plz
I love this small so much im learning videography for about one year and i want took movie on Xperia 1 but i dont have that much money to buy can you send me that smartphone? I will be so grateful
when is the review comin? cmonnn its perfect phone..
Oh you mean the first Sony phone with OIS? Sony is a joke now. The only thing I buy from them is Play Station. Fortunately I am not into headphones so that&#39;s fine.
my first phone was a sony k750 :} idk if anyone here remember it but it was the best phone out there back in time as i remember .. i currently using Xperia XA1 ultra and it works amazing to a 2 years old phone
For the price.. not impressed at all.  I have a moto z4 and it blows that away. As with most products , it&#39;s the name you are paying for...
Sony has one of the best display around. Low brightness and fucks everything. sadly its underrated coz its costly and has battery problems. All that display drains the battery so fast. If they can make a phone that has good display + longer than samsung battery life = god phone.
xperia 1 best phone on the market
I dont like sony products, but i do like Japanese girls.
I currently have the xz1 and love it, my experia 1 arrives tomorrow and I cannot wait to play around with it
I didn&#39;t know that Sony still makes a phone.
I find it mind boggling that this was release in July and it is already severely outdated in tech despite the 4k resolution but come on now nobody wants a super power hungry 4k display on a phone given how small the battery is 3300mah, phones coming out now are pushing 4500mah.
did i see keanu reeves at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=537">8:57</a>...
my first smart phone is xperia 1, i been using sony ericsson before that, i can say nothing bad about sony phone consider i modded my xperia to the core and it still function so well before i switched out. i actually dont like these samsung galaxy as much these day because the bezel on s7 and s9 are nothing but useless. i dont know which smart phone i will get next. Maybe this one in another month or two? or a newer xperia by the time it comes out.
Galaxy s9 is that you??
Fingerprint site from the idea of ​​Sony, the first company to put the fingerprint in that place, and is the first company to put a special button for the camera.
I would buy it only if Sony start putting dedicated DACs like LG does i mean why not? Sony started off as Walkman
Maybe I&#39;ll get the xperia 3 when my note 9 dies, but until then, I&#39;m Gucci :)
My Official Sony history.<br><br>Sony Ericsson K750i<br>Sony Ericsson W850<br>Sony Ericsson W900i<br>Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 (Very first Xperia Line on Microsoft Mobile OS, exclusive on O2)<br>EDIT :How could I forget my Sony Xperia PLAY(PlayStation)?!! <br>Then my interest piqued further.<br>Xperia Z - First and Official Waterproof phone! I was probably among first 100 owners.<br>Xperia Z3- Phenomenal battery life!!<br>Xperia Z3+ - Heating issue but loved it, then lost it in Crete buried in the sea after snorkeling lol😭<br>Xperia Z5 PREMIUM, sold it to get the XZ Premium! The Greatest phone I&#39;ve ever owned and still own. Now typing this with my Xperia 1, proud owner since  June 3rd and watching and listening with my freebie MX3 Headphones. Hail SONY!
i hate sony phones with a strong passion
Sony&#39;s taste in colors is always good
Can you make a video of the xperia 5?
Sony still makes phones?
Really a great phone
Thankyou
I have this phone. Love it! Incredible display! No complaints!
So it feels like an XA1 upgrade. I like it. I enjoyed that phone so I might check this one out
Who else just learned about the youtube zoom thing
watchinv 4k in my 360p phone
As an iphone guy, this is really the only phone im considering getting once my iPhone SE cant keep up.
hate you
I used Xperia SP,and was using Xperia XA, but I finally got an Oppo Reno 10x Zoom now 😂. The premium Xperia costs a lot! for the specs, probably I could&#39;ve gotten a mid-tier China phones, which is cheaper. I love Sony phones for their design, but my wallet can&#39;t agree with me 😪
Finally...
iPhone sounded better
one sheep follows another just like i phone users
Sometimes Sony falls under the radar but they&#39;re so unbelievably reliable. They hardly slow after years of heavy use in my experience. Unfortunate that they don&#39;t get as much attention as they&#39;ve also pioneered many incredible features. 4k screens, waterproofing etc. If im not wrong they were the first to do so.
Nic dvic how much price
Sony is amazing
I actually might buy this phone. I&#39;m a big Sony fan.
the battery capacity isn&#39;t great, but at least it uses an algorithm to enhance battery life and prevent overheating
Imagine if Sony made a PSP successor, with external gamepad based on Xperia
Sony is coming back
4k would need more than a 4000mAh battery. If this phone had that and a duel speakers I would think about getting it. Other than that 1440p would be better for a phone and to last longer in battery life under 4000mAh.
sold only in third world countries and japan where they think its better than iPhone or Galaxy
Sony phones are garbage
Sony Xperia is super
Sony doesn&#39;t compete with samsung/apple. They set the benchmark.
This phone is just amazing
You got my attention when you said 950$!!!!...i stopped the video immediately and wrote a comment about how im surprised🙄🙄😓
Frankly OLED or not, the screen is underwhelming, just pixel pushing 2160p does not make it a flagship. Seriously this screen looks way dimmer than it should under artificial lighting, imagine what it will do under natural daylight and honestly i found this issue also on the Xperia Z i used long back. Also such a big display pushing 4k @ only 3300mAH juice, this thing is going to run out in half a day no matter whatever optimization you put on it. TBH i heard a lot of good things in the review about the phone, but i am yet to see one myself in the video(barring the super detailed video interface), the back looks like of like polycarbonate and not real glass and the photos look underwhelming although i think the lackluster display is to blame. I commend Sony for trying to bring out a phone that focuses on immersive viewing experience but this phone is so underwhelming is some other key aspects that i don&#39;t think it serves its price tag right.
yea get ready to carry around a battery pack not even 3500mh battery on a 4k display unless they have done some witch craft under the hood its going to eat your battery alive 4k is pointless on a phone eats your battery and your using that extra horse power to power it if games support 4k
Xperia 5 is out bro, please review it. Love Sony.
I was one of the unlucky Sony experia xa1 purchaser&#39;s. Worst smartphone I&#39;ve owned in my life
Did they bring back native screen recording feature?
Honestly sony xperia phones is not the problem it&#39;s actually there marketing strategy and price is not competitive sony&#39;s phone is expensive overprice
Who gives the head phones with it.
Watching with my Xperia 1 👌🏽💯
Edit: why do the cameras have such fewer megapixels? My old Z5 has a 23mgpx camera but this new one is only 12?<br>I still have and love my Z5 compact.
Are really sure it&#39;s deserve attention on the product or the quality??? Try on the Video and Camera which will SHUT DOWN &amp; OVERHEAT less then 2 minute.<br><br>SONY ARE NOT TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUS. DAMN DISAPPOINTING...
Sony is the father of all mobiles they produce something unique every time... but they need improveme their marketing strategies country by country... I love sony and its quality..❤❤
No fuckin 3.5mm
The phone is amazing, but the camera software is garbage. And this is so disappointing when they make all the best camera sensors hardware.
We love you from Iraq
I&#39;ve been using the Xperia z2 I&#39;m writing from for the past 4 and a half years, and never got a problem. I only changed the battery after 4 years because it didn&#39;t last a full day anymore, but besides that it&#39;s the most reliable phone I&#39;ve ever had
Sony by far manufacture the robust phones compared to Chinese phones. especially I like their Music app, Album app and icons style.
This is actually one of the most elegant looking phone on the market right now. But I&#39;m a functional stuff guy. I&#39;m even finding 18:9 aspect useless and wanna go back to 16:9. But for the best look this is it.b
I have a Xperia z3 a Xperia xz2 and I&#39;m hoping to  get a purple Xperia 1. Never going to switch android is so much user friendly then Apple, you can share stuff between other Androids. I recently purchased a mhcv11 Sony bluetooth speaker and it&#39;s the  integration between Sony devices is perfect . My ps4 has no problem recognizing my phone as a USB device. I have a ps1, ps2, ps3 a fat ps4 and a ps4 pro as you can tell, I love Sony  products!
The King has returned!!!! Long live SONY!!!!!
17
I have xperia z5 for the last 3 years... Not a single problem ever occured... Love for xperia
big screen..... small battery
Ihave a problem buying high-end phones without Super Amoled display that why i cant buy iphones.
<b>SONY</b> 💪
Really cool phone, but I would rather have 2x Pocos :-) Or a poco and 300$ in pocket. But cool phone non the less..
have they fixed the connectivity issues?
You can change your name to talking therapy .
I miss my Xperia X2 with Windows 6.5
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
woww. love the video quality of this smartphones
This phone has nothing to offer i simply can buy note 2 and it will be better than this and cheaper 😂😂😂
I mean why sony?? <br>Made such a good phone but the screen ratio
Alweys a good rewie 👍
Is this sony’s frist smartphone?☺️ I want them to have built in PS4 remote play function!
My first phone was a Sony Xperia.... Best phone ever!<br><br>Now I have a LG. 😭
Does anyone know what kind of case is on the 7 pro?
Lags and the camera is last thing to worry about while using sony phones.
The camera posture struggle is real tho. Tap the screen to focus or take pictures could make the camera shake and lose focus, which sucks.<br><br><br>Don&#39;t even get me started on making the camera shake and lose focus trying to reach the volume button on the phone with your one hand to avoid making the camera shake and lose focus by tapping the screen, ultimately causing the camera to shake and lose focus in the process. That also sucks.
Reason supposdly why Sony doesn&#39;t have the fingerprint sensor intergrated with the power button cause HP has the patents and the license on that technology in the United States. Throwbacks to the xperia xz1 days where in the United States, the side mounted fingerprint sensor was disabled on United States models by software due to such patent and licensing issues.
Sony sucks ASS. I had 2.
Sony is gr8.<br>😊
i hate sony because spiderman out from MCU right now.. damn it
Sony totally lost me as a potential customer with that aspect ratio
How much sony xperia 1?
One of the things sony devices have had going for them for years was front firing speakers.  Very  shortsighted of them to take away something like that. And to lose to the OP7 in sound,  well that&#39;s pretty bad because the OP7 isnt great.
I do love your videos !! ..but I find it annoying that you don&#39;t even mention anything about the  device specifications ..I mean how does the processor.. storage ..what kinds of storage it uses and stuff !!
I’m going back here,but pre smartphone days best phone I had was a Sony Ericsson w900i. That thing had killer speakers I used it on building sites like a stereo. Good brand Sony.
I&#39;m really surprised you didn&#39;t talk about the video recording fps. 960fps I think? I hope you&#39;re going to do a re-review of the X1 and the rest if it&#39;s features.
NOBODY HATES SONY, ISNT THAT ENOUGH ?
Loser completely ignored the fact that it lacks a headphone jack, and it comes with headphones that requires a JACK! tells me a lot about this channel.
Who&#39;s watching this video with sony Xperia? 🙋
Why does this guy have 15 million sub&#39;s?
Have XZ Premium two and a half years. Battery still holds all day without problem. Had a XZ1 before. My next is xperia 1. Ones Sony always Sony. My wife changed two fancy Samsungs in those two years. At the bigining bei Samsung is battery longer lasting, bat with time it losses on strength. Bei Sony  is more stable lasting battery life.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=44">0:44</a> &quot;Different aspect ratio&quot;. &quot;as many pixels as possible&quot;. Then later... 21:9. <br>In order to maximise the number of pixels for a given screen diameter, the aspect ratio needs to be as close to 1:1 as possible. The further you go from a 1:1 ratio, the fewer pixels there will be per square inch, for a given diameter.<br><br>And 21:9 is further from 1:1 than most phones on the market today.<br><br><br>Elongating the screen is actually a marketing trick to make it appear bigger whilst actually lowering the number of pixels (for a given diameter and pixel density).
the purple colour is dope, the side-mounted finger print scanner, the dedicated camera button are all beautiful the grip is also fulfilling
they should have added some juice to the battery, and improved the sound production
fuck you sony !!! you cannot remove spider man from MCU idiot!!!!!!
Review the Sony Xperia xZ premium your mind will be blown
Can it play PUBG? What&#39;s the aspect ratio do in game?
I think just for being the perfect smartphone for me replace the UI to vanilla and I will buy it tomorrow 😊
The Sony is out the side finger print duz not really work for a left handed person.
Gadget Mania is uploading your videos as their own.
AGAGAA
i had a sony xperia when they came out  the Sound quality is awesome compared to apple and samsung and its Loud.
Sony is so disjointed... Why don&#39;t they make a phone that utilizes their Playstation and Walkman brand? Specifically with their Walkman nowadays, they could release an Xperia phone that has a headphone jack with high quality audio components.
its great for vr 4k hdr display ....and sony headphone audio quality is feels like studio
Sony has great phones (I have the XZ3). But in all the revue that I read, they say Samsung and Huawei are better phones. The only think possible is that Samsung and Huawei paid the evaluation in these tests. If I have paid attention to those tests, I would never buy a Sony. But I Know what quality is, and that’s why I bought Sony Smartphones. When I show the pictures that I took with my Xperia, all the people that has other brands ask me if they can have this pictures (the revues always said that the Xperia cams are not good). I only hope that Sony never give up the smartphones, because I wouldn’t know witch brand to buy. But I&#39;m sure I would be disappointed.
I&#39;m so going Sony when Xperia 2 enter the market.
My Xperia Z3+ sort of kicked the bucket, with over 3 years of use. It is bent, by account of me throwing it in the wall. Pretty hard, it bent but it was no problem with it. Recently the software is acting up. Certain keys didn’t work when I pressed them. Not being able to write a message. I’m sure a restart of the phone would have fixed that. Awesome phones
I still use sony Z1 from 6years ago 😁😁😁
Sony has had a dedicated camera shutter button for years. I remember it on my Sony Z2. Still one of my favorite phones of all time.
What’s the case he is using on the oneplus 7 pro?
I just want to be able to use the Remote Play app tbh. That&#39;s the only reason I even know about it.
Sony phones  is trash, don&#39;t waste your money, and more is difficult to repair.
DON&#39;T CARE WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THIS PHONE CAUSE FOR ME IT&#39;S A PRETTY GOOD PHONE...!!! PLUS THAT OVERALL NEW DESIGN...!!! I WOULD BUY THIS PHONE VS A LOT OF OTHER FLAGSHIP PHONES OUT THERE...!!!
Huawei P30Pro
I still find the price being insane!
Ugly like my ex 😂😂😂 Note 10+ is a king.
Amazing sony
I have clicked on the link that’s been given, and it clearly shows those headphones are an extra charge. I don’t see anywhere where they will freely give those headphones. I was really looking forward to going back to the Sony Xperia.
Sony phones are sadly so underrated! They&#39;re reliable, fast and beautiful! Proud XZ Premium owner!
21:9 is a bad feature.
3k battery with 4k display? Yeah nah.
It is ugly. There. I said it.
My mom has the old xperia.
Nice phone  I am your big fan
I own and use this phone. And let me tell you, it&#39;s kinda disappointing seing they put so much effort in the screen and camera, but not on the battery. I mean sure I survive as it is, but got kinda spoiled after using huawei mate 10 pro. Why? Well the mate had faster charge (even managed to stay cool unlike Sony xperia) , better battery handling (power saving features), could use it for longer, better standby time, battery saver that functioned as it should (not to mention, could pick own apps to have in their ultra stamina mode, and didn&#39;t have to restart the phone every damn time going out of the ultra stamina mode). Other than that it is a great phone. Also, as I like the side fingerprint sensor, I don&#39;t mind at all. Hated the back sensor. Other than that, it is a great phone. But for some reason, the battery always is an issue with the Sony phones (last Sony I owned before this one was z5, which had same annoyance as this one).
Headphone jacks have been around for a hell of a lot of years to be fair. But if you&#39;re in America, at least you don&#39;t have to put up with EU headphone volume limits like we do. Even when the limit is turned off and you up the volume to max, it&#39;s still too quiet on the bundled headphones in the box. I still use my old iphone4 to listen to music as it was out before the legislation passed. But it&#39;s the screen that makes this phone. Hands down the best mobile screen for live Premier League football
what is the kind of ur watch plz
Sony always has a place in my heart. I hope they will stay in the game.
Is it an ugly phone... period...
Hey man give me that my Sony broke
Use the camera in manual mode and be amazed on what it can do. It&#39;s like having a mirrorless camera!
Is the camera good compared to other brands?
Do Black Shark 2 Pro!!!
I freaking love this phone. Wish I could afford it. Who knows , may be in a few years
Iphone se 2
Love mine. Initially it had overheating problems but after hooking it to my PC and using the Sony software repair program and after the recent update no more overheating when recording 60fps video. Looks like it&#39;s a keeper😁
Love ya so much for doing the speaker test aswell. So important for some ppl 🥰
Sony sucks... for 999 euros? Dont buy this you guys, samsung has all the pro camera features in &quot;pro mode&quot; so dont tell us something new bro
no headphone jack?? there must be a headphone jeff
Thanks
Sory Xperia is bad on the battery don&#39;t buy these shit.
4K 21:9 is great, but are you sure it cant sound better? It sounded horrible. Edit: How does it compare to Note 10+? Eagerly awaiting more!
What watch are you wearing? Looks great
Is the promo gone? Where can I buy this and get the headphones?
Owned Sony Z1 in 2013 ,with the warranty the phone started jerking. But that was their 2nd phone after their comeback.
16:9 -&gt; 18:9 -&gt; 18.5:9 -&gt; 19.5:9 -&gt; 20:9 -&gt; 21:9... Waiting for 100:9 light saber-phone
I don&#39;t like the 21:9 phones at all.
You like a caveman just exposed to Sony world :D
Please make video short
Is there an anamorphic mode for anamorphic adapters like moment or moondog ?
You have to hold the Phone horizontal to experience the dolby sound. Btw, Sony all the way ;-)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=113">1:53</a> Do you forgot the sony XZ premium?  +800 PPI in 2017<br>great video, love from South america
Is Sony xperia still alive ?
Does this phone have headphone jack?
Had my sony z3 for 6 years now and looking forward for a new sony phone.but too sad because they pulled out all their phone in other countries including Philippines what a bummer.
How rich r u buying all these electonics??
long phoen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=120">2:00</a> already unimpressed just looking at the back of the box...<br><br>3300MaH, 12\8 MP, no mention of onboard storage (implying it&#39;s unimpressive).. Lew just announced 18 watt charging while I type... Meh. Nice headphones bro
for the screen length <br>they should make it a little wider
sony left india :(
Xperia 1 4K HDR BT2020 OLED 120HZ<br>Super display
4K screen and 3300mah, Sony still clueless as ever when it comes to phones
Anybody remember Sony Ericsson ? Sony Ericsson W810i was my first phone and I&#39;ve been using Sony phone since then.
Can you give me...
The phone which can use second screen, need to get it but i like my phone
Sony &lt;3
That 4k screen is going to destroy that battery. So it becomes a what&#39;s the point thing b/c you have to switch it to a lower resolution. If the battery was bigger I would buy this phone.
Sony better . They built better last longer
Where&#39;s the selfie test? 😁
I have used the Xperia E3, Xperia M4 Aqua, and now the Xperia XZ1. I must say that I dont feel like using no other phone other than the Xperias. Theres something soo unique that keeps me glued to them. The Xperias.
Ouh yeah
too narrow
The 4k version is way better
Let us know what u thought about  the phone I got the Toronto raptor purple one too
PlayStation users hit like 👍
Actual unbox starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=137">2:17</a>
The price and the lack of willing to compete with peers and really short budget marketing is causing Sony&#39;s gradual death..why Sony??
Z5 was a beast! But also like this new Xperias, finally fingerprint on the side again!
after sony recent stun i just hope this product got better wear and tear resistance
I still have my Xperia Z5 compact from initial release.  By far greatest little phone I&#39;ve ever owned and I&#39;ll be picking up another soon.  The new xperias just ain&#39;t like the old ones....
Could you do a video on the Sony Xperia 10. It’s a new phone I discovered and I’m debating on whether to switch or not from the iPhone 8 Plus.
who cares about sony phones?????????????????????? lol
Hi, I have an sony xperia and I am proud to have bought it so you said you have doubts about the battery, but in battery setings it is the option of stamina mode and ultra stamina mode which allows to extreme extend the battery life in exchange for some functions leaving only the basic element.
I really really like it. Top 3 contenders for my next phone
But the real question is : is it cybershot ?
Dedicated shutter button has got to be the most under-rated feature on a phone. I can&#39;t bring myself to get a phone without one now.
Do the switch already!
I have the sony flagship from 2 years ago - xz premium. its the best phone ive ever used. not showing any signs of slowing down... even tho sometimes i want an excuse to buy xperia 1 haha
Load of crap thumb print I&#39;d stopped working after 1st week can&#39;t download Netflix from play store can&#39;t watch YouTube vides for more than 30 secons very unimpressed
Not gonna switch still Lew? Been too comfortable with the Oneplus?
Don&#39;t forget... Gucci gang 🎶Gucci game 🎶Gucci gang 🎶
Missed my xperia T21i my very first xperia. 😂
I&#39;m writing with xperia1 after a vacation with a big family. They all have iphone x, I&#39;m the only one with Xperia1 and xpera xz2. They stopped taking photos with their iphone. They were really surprised by the xperia photos.<br><br>The display is big and really great 4k oled with a great sound. Netflix and YouTube has a different feeling.<br><br>Great quality, I had xperia since day one, no one broke.<br><br>Great mobile never to leave sony
Let’s be honest, it looks like the xtra tall iPhone 10 parody back in the day
Sony is legend
4k OLED screen that is 21:9 and snapdragon 855? DAMN<br><br>too bad the battery is kind of small for all of this , but its ok for me as an old sony user
Xperia 1 without a doubt ! Neo the Gamer
Xperia 1 not available Dubai, I will order from USA
If you have to edit out mistakes from what you&#39;ve recorded earlier, then you suck
絶対にxperia が売れる方法<br>Ps4と連携したらええ
I&#39;m disappointed about moving away from 16:9 and now 21:9?!!! It&#39;s just far too narrow.
Checked one out before I bought the 7pro. I don&#39;t like that long skinny feel and look. Plus the 7pro is cheaper and has amazing specs.
hey lew can you review xiaomi mi a3? like if u agree
Dude, the camera?
Unless you live in Australia. Sony have pulled their phones from our market. So disappointed as I wanted to upgrade to Sony XZ2 Premium after my XZ. Just upgraded yesterday to Oppo Reno, not my first preference but would prefer Oppo to Samsung or Apple&#39;. Going to miss my XZ so much! Get yourself together Sony! Australia needs you!
Sony the ultimate king
Really don&#39;t know why people love samsung but not sony. Sony is way better than samsung
Sony&#39;s side fingerprint scanner is great, they put it at a good place and no need to wait at all. U touch it and it&#39;s unlocked. Screen fingerprint scanner is soooo slow. And sometimes i have to try few times to get the right position. I always thought if there is some problem with the scanner.
Why give head phones why not take 350 off price !
I had the same mini disc player in blue !
Sony is the best, my old xperia z is still working fine and i m using xperia x without any problem. So happy that sony goes back to their omni balance design instead of the funny curve back
You should shoot your videos in 21:9 or at least this video.
Its the future i can&#39;t wait till this aspect becomes the trend.
Its gorgeous
Sony is good fune but i bought my Sony Experia Z1 &amp; Z3 the problem when i use in longer time the body become hot. And the letters are so thin and small.
Where is switching to xperia 1 video
anyone else just wanna know that color code
How does the average consumer tell which Xperia is the latest one just by looking at the name?
Its has the same features as their old Z series. But more beefer performance 😍
Please review sony xperia 10 plus
Bad battery
cinema view.<br>having huge bezels and not implementing crazy hardware for face unlock.<br>still NOT HAVING DUAL FRONT FACING SPEAKERS ,🤔🤔🤨
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=537">8:57</a> does anyone know what smartwatch is Lew wearing?
Do not buy this phone... I have had mine 6 weeks now and it is full of problems. 4G drops in and out, the phone over heats and drops calls, weak signal, jumps into aeroplane mode,  fingerprint recognition is nowhere near as good as the iPhone and hard to use and Sony support is rubbish. On paper this phone should be amazing but reality once again Sony haven&#39;t got this one sorted and it still needs a lot of work and better customer service.
Unbox and review the Aladdin connect smart garage door opener
My first cell phone  Clearnet was a sony.
xperia xa2 or nokia 7.1 ( design and camera is my primary)  so which one? :)
this phone costs as much as i earn a month :(
Its Japanese. Cant go wrong.
i HAD THE VERY FIRST xPERIA SHIT WAS BADASS
Dat purple color!!!....alright i am robbing a bank
Sony needs to bring back the power button / finger print scanner combo. Also, bring back the headphone jack. Nobody asked for it to be removed.
you cant put google camera on it !
And they have still 10 cm black border.
Test 21:9 avengers endgame
3,330mA... thumbs down 👎
I have that phone and I&#39;ll only use Sony Xperia phones.  Samsung and Apple suck...  LOL
Me and my friend both bought Sony cell phones 2 years ago. It became our most hated phone ever!  Absolutely could not wait till I could exchange it.  I am still paying for the Sony phone which i dont use at all anymore.  Lots of apps did not work on it and the Wifi and Bluetooth did not work properly, the screen is as dull as if there were a dull switch and it was on 100%. There are some hardware flaws which many many owners talk about but Sony refuses to acknowlege any problem exists.  Class action lawsuit anyone?  Avoid Sony cell phones.
Imagine an 8k smartphone
I will choose this phone than any samsung phone 😂 I really like the Sony ❤️
Is this phone waterproof????
The only phone that can remote play your games from your ps4 <br>Whilst using your favourite ps4 remote
one plus 7 pro for sure, aint no phone worth paying $950
Sony xperias are underrated Sony phones are innovators the rest are imitators
Nothing quite new. The fingerprint scanner has been on the market since 0&#39;9. I sold an Xperia X last summer I bought from Japan for $100.
The best phone ever i already got mine
is the promo over?
well, i don&#39;t even own a 4k tv ...
no such thing as attnx ro deservero not

3300 mah battery for a 643 ppi OLED screen??? Why Sony?? Why??
The experia z3 was the BEST  waterproof phone and camra ive EVER had
All this talk and nothing about how well it operates when talking on the phone !!🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ it’s a fucking phone lol , any of you broke ass motherfuckers buying this shit to create content !! Buy yourself a real camera !!
What about front camera 📷?
Nothing to do with the phone, but them Headphone are awfully similar to Bose’s. Design-wise. 🤔
I was so excited when I saw that you were doing a Sony Experia because that the kind of phone I have and noone talks about it! I have the Sony experia z1 so its one of the older ones tho
Sony had the best camera set up before Oled screens came into play
Hey bro im a fan of Sony gadgets specially experia mobile, I&#39;m destined to work here in Jeddah but unfortunately, all Sony experia mobiles here were eliminated since last year and I am badly needed to buy that experia one, haven&#39;t tried buying online so I am kinda paranoid due to scammers issues, can you give me a trusted sites or suggestions where can I avail one. Please need your help and I like your review awesome.
ohhh i mean we are looking at a compared price of the ROG II phone.... Just saying
Sony Xperias best long term quality out there
Best phone of 2019
Unbox Therapy is missing a lot with Xperia phones. XZ3 is beast!
Sony phones are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Got one. Cracked the screen within 6 minutes.
I love Sony xperia 1 ❤️
I got rid of my S10 once I have tried this beast. On that moment I remembered that we live in a world of propaganda. I had never seen a review that would convinced me to buy the Xperia 1. I had to try it by myself to know it. Don&#39;t let this YouTube guys take decisions for you. They all get paid at the end of the day to tell what they have been told to do.
always wondered why he never reviewed sony phones.. seems like he hasn&#39;t even seen a sony phone in ten years
I&#39;m surprised he is still using this. Thought he would have tossed it by now. I loved my XZ1 gave it to a friend....trying to decide on this one...
You finally reviewed it😂
Love the vids of Melbourne and Sydney Australia, Lee (and Willy Doo). Being an Aussie, aussie, aussie, oi, oi, oi bloke living Southwest Sydney and currently in Melbourne. I thought I would give a shout out. Hoodoo for now.
Is that a Suunto watch?
Still using my xz premium. Best phone I ever had. I even prefer it to my Razer 2, which I broke.
Oh look another phone that does exactly the same shit as every other phone of 2019😥
Bangladesh price
No 3.5mm audio  fuck this piece of shit
The Sony Xperia&#39;s were the first smarphones i&#39;ve ever seen.
If only I could afford this..
Why u r watching ur right side
will this come to canada at all? I dont wanna get one of these for one of my kidneys and beat by the network.
iPhone 8  plus
Thanks for showing me my next phone =)
might want to look at other Japanese cellphones that North American cell phone network providers are not pushing, like the Sharp phones (the Japanese-made ones, not the Chinese-made ones)
The design feature of unlocking the phone is that you slide your thumb from the unlocking button to the finger print scanner.
that color is awesome
love the color of that phone
I love that smartphones have officially reached pixel density that is impossible to detect with the human eye! Nice one, Sony! 😍 No need to go any more dense than this.
that aspect ratio will probably suffer with IG stories or such. It happens to me with Huawei P20 which is a bit slimmer than other phones (samsung, iphone, etc)
Sony still rock.....Still got my Sony Play maxed with emulators.
I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s called 21:9 ratio when it&#39;s the same as 7:3. Maybe it&#39;s a marketing tactic or something but it seems like a weird stretch
@unbox therapy... what watch are you wearing bro?
Damage isn&#39;t too bad at USD $1700 on prime.
wah!sony still survival
Is it worth $900 plus?
I like Sony
Why would he not use the Dolby?
WARNING:  Noise canceling is the WORST thing .....  people cant hear and are getting killed
Where is the front camera....u dint showed the front camera part
Please try realme 3 pro🙏🙏🙏
I have the Sony xa ultra. Pretty much the same.
Plz do unboxing of Asus ROG 2
It&#39;s still don&#39;t have a pen. like galaxy note.
Hi mân try the smartphone xiaomi Mi a2 the buget Smart phone  display 6  dual camera 32mpx  camera front 20 Sony camera
Sony cannot beat OnePlus phone 😉😉
I love Sony mobile phones. They just mix up every of their products like their dslr, tv oled and their speakers which are massive to one device and name it xperia
Can you do a more in depth review? This one seems to do the bare minimum. Seriously stretched it to 10 minutes 😟
Never owned one, but my top 3 fav phones are:<br>My iphone xr <br>note series<br>and these huge ass xperia phones with their clean android firmware
dang this phone is a beast! does anyone know if it will work with Verizon?
Nice coller
Seems like I’m getting a phone and another pair of Sony Wh-1000 xm3
I will not know how good it is. I&#39;ve been struck by impulsive expenses since smartphones prices has been dropping left and right. My Z5 is still working fine, my G5 is in excellent condition. I just bought the XZ Premium when I saw it on a mall this year after it goes cheap. Now I am using the XZ3 after I saw it dropped to 568 in amazon. I still have the V30+ that my company has granted me to. No new phone for me for the next three years unless it gives some new awesome features that will fit my pocket.
Just bought the Xperia 1 for $515!!! Aye letsssss goooooooooooo
When are you going to make video on realms x...??
Isn&#39;t 21 by 9 really 7 by 3. This is just like the 18 by 9 advertising with is basically 2 by 1.
Rog 2
Bogus phone... wastage of money....this device is for brat kids
Only diehard fan of Sony can purchase this phone...
4k screen with a 3300mah battery is the same as the older xz premium, which also had shit battery life
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvttOM9-dqA&amp;t=22">0:22</a> &quot;...the Walkman changed the game for me and others&quot; and shows a CD one.<br><br><br>Me. Remembers the original cassette player + FM radio tuner Walkman. Sigh.
But it costs 3x more than a Mi 9T, which has a headphone jack, 48MP camera and 4000mA battery. Good luck Sony. I dislike the Xperia 1 aspect ratio, too.
I have used Sony flagship phones for 4 years now (Xperia Z5 Premium, XZ Premium) and the camera button has been just like that in all of them. Screen is one of the best parts in Sony phones. Cameras I like too. Battery life and speakers (not loud enough) could be improved. Also the internal storage space has not been big enough. Design has been better in Sony compared to other manufacturers. They seem to be well-made products which are made for male consumers.
How do you like it now?
Beautiful phone but no Thank You. Sony&#39;s customer service is terrible I have a Somy Xperia Z Ultra in a box because I had an accident with it and after the $600 price I paid they never help to either fix it or help get a new one. They said they would have a manager call me and about 10 years later I&#39;m still waiting for that call 🤣 I&#39;ll keep my chances with Samsung and Best Buy.
bro can u suggest a phone too shoot videos in budget
Sony&#39;s been doing side-mounted fingerprint readers for the longest fucking time, mate...
U don&#39;t know best feature of this phone and that is its sound quality which other phone can&#39;t deliver
Sony is underrated tbh
&quot;Here is an exciting 1&quot;
Biggest selling point to me is the ability to play PS Games and if that has expanded. A demo on that please.
No Sony service is South Africa
Xperia 2 has 5k display🔥
One plus. If we live in 3 years ago, that Sony phone is just fine. But what year is it now?! Hello, does Sony know?
I&#39;m from the Philippines!
Hi lew, I wanna win a sony experia!
I am sony fan ....since its got bravia engine ....c5ultra one of the best mobile i have ever used
Can you please test its gaming chops, specifically the remote play for PS4?
I prefer a slightly wider phone.
Problematic to right handed with finger scan at one side. The manual shutter button not appropriate as it’s shaking when pressing on it.
NICE!!
I started my smartphone from sony xperia ray.
They started the game of water resistant smart phone the Xperia z which i still use as my daily driver, but over the years they have kind of lost to the compilation with poor material and design choices.
Does it fit any vr devices
It&#39;s great until ghost touch syndrome occurs. It sucks eventually as well as their support.
Boring phone
Jack do you also do giveaways with the smartphones/gadgets that you dont use?
Waiting for docomo version <br>Respect from indo🇮🇩 😆😆😆
Wallpaper they used is awful. I think Sony needs a very new and attractive interface.
Sir can u make a review for xperia xz2 compact
Still have my old mini disk player and disc man in a keepsake box 😅 I just can’t part ways with them. 🤦‍♂️
Can i have it?
I would prob go for it, if they have this in stock.
Sony trying to get back into the game!
Sony needs to hire someone worthy for their marketing department
What&#39;s the point of 4k on such a small device?
I love sony devices <br>When it will be available in PAKISTAN?
I missed the dedicated camera buttons :( the last phone i had that has that button was the Alcatel Flash 2 and the Nokia Lumia 720. and that was years ago :(
Hello, What smartwatch are you using?
Watching this on my Xperia 1. Best phone I have ever had.
Can you give me a smartphone?
I hope someone would give me one of those, my birthday is coming❤😢
I know that the Xperia 1 &quot;Creator Mode&quot; supports Netflix.... But can anyone inform me if the &quot;Creator Mode&quot; also supports the &quot;Amazon Prime Video&quot;?
Why dont you try flash with camera and some night shots❤
12+12+12 is 36
A different approach!... Really nice
Hello I&#39;m from philippines
3300 battery with 4K display goodluck with that you will be charging this phone every 6 hours
Cool phone but you can&#39;t even get a sony on AT&amp;T or T-Mobile. Two major brands obviously.
Your fav headphones ey<br><br><br>I’ll think about it<br><br>I can’t choose between oneplus 7 and Xperia 1
It&#39;s Just Gorgeous ❤️
2 things: <br><br>1. Dolby sound on phones is terrible for people who are interested in true representation of original sound. Limited EQ capability, fixed preset and terrible volume leveling. I&#39;ve changed phones because of that, and I also downgraded from Windows 10 for the same reason. Modern day Dolby sound is horrible, mainly because auto-compression is NEVER set properly at factory setting. Sony should have gone with Realtek.<br><br>2. If the camera technology (particularly video recording) isn&#39;t as good as the latest Galaxy, it&#39;s not worth bothering with. Display resolution doesn&#39;t really make much of a difference if it&#39;s a medium sized screen. I&#39;m disappointed in this review because photo and video tech is more than 1/3 of the cost that goes into the total price and you didn&#39;t talk much about it. <br><br>Other than those 2 points (which are deal breakers for me) the phone seems nice, but the price is entirely laughable. $500 is what it&#39;s worth. Also, Plantronics make excellent noise cancelling headsets for under $100. I&#39;m sure people will have their own tastes, but I&#39;m speaking from the pov of a professional audio engineer, which I am.
holy shit that ppi
Sony used the finger print scanner on the Z5 model a long time ago
Them: The iPhone XS MAX is so big<br><br><br><br><br>Xperia 1: Hey there
You can play PS4 games there and link your acc there 😉.
love from INDIA.🇮🇳
It looks like TV remote control
that&#39;s just another classic Sony. They&#39;ll never change the UI. <br><br>Doesn&#39;t mean it is bad but it&#39;s rathe boring. Thank God we can install launchers on Android
Unbox Therapy Marketing <br><br>Jul 2 2019 ~The Sony Xperia 1 Deserves Your Attention<br>weeks later~Don&#39;t buy Sony Xperia 1 , here why...
Damn that shit is classy and unique
4k screen with a 3300 sized battery is not a good combination
I had an Experia wayyyy back and it was ahead of its time it had all the features all the phones have now
3.9 for me
just take the oneplus with the 90 hz display.
🤔 Sony seem to be doing what Apple refuse to 😬
Thank god there&#39;s wilido or else this phone might have been forgotten XD.
Sony xz2 compact is great
