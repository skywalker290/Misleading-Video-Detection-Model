Demi Is Cool
Demi you already are in paradise
2024
When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️

It&#39;s a disgrace that they already have the song scratched

I just a AI big guy, I think it is Yo-Han, a real live bum and jail bird, that is in and out of jail, try not to sign him in your videos, because he is really dangerous he will slip mickey&#39;s in your drinks and your girls drinks, and take advantage of your lives, talk soon Hotties.
Do your riders need earings, like yours too, all of them are Hotties too, like you!
Fly bitch❤😊
Admit, you have already masturbed seeing this clip at puberty 😂😂😂😂
why did I only discover this song in 2023? I missed out on so many years vibing to it. Thank god Taylor Swift danced to it so I could find it
Man I remember hearing this during the summer when I was just a teenager, having the time of my life
always and forever will be cool for the summer
When she wasn&#39;t crazy, fat and gender confused.
Claimed for Tom Ebbs

DEMI ROOMORE
2024 where y’all at!!!
Nostálgia
I am gay . My parents both decided not to practice religion. Grew up in rural Minnesota at a time when it was deemed ungodly . So I had two strikes against me. Years later I would have a chance meeting with two former teachers at a Gay bar.  They pretended to be a romantic straight couple. Both have passed on. Sadly , I don’t think they would hired if they were honest about themselves. Namaste Leroy and Mary
Me lembra minha ex namorada 😂
Just mind blowing😊😊
Taylor Swift bought me here
Always be a vibe
I bet her crowd has mosh pits when the hook from this song drops. 😅

wow sexy af
Demi, I know that it&#39;s still winter where I am, and it&#39;s not summer anymore again. But, this song rocks any time of the year by you! You go, girl!
A daring deed isn&#39;t that of retained offer when elsing isn&#39;t fought to fit through wonders.but we tend to not avoid its disasters what griefs us is pain given by a sought manipulations.reviving a best category shouldn&#39;t be first desired but envy sorting justice .to state a infamy to engage some sort of completions .only to exceed a policy for neglect that doesn&#39;t comply urgencies.evil mustnt win in most places cause with deficits sure regrets surely follows.aniexty comforts the more independent terms of disagreeing most common invokes.what redeems fate isn&#39;t a sought advantage but a temporary complacency of redirecting a not .weld purpose defining a may how from know  how.intervene a subject  courtesying a need for an entitled sooth is a refined choice.
I&#39;m happy that the songs are trending now. It deserves more recognition than it being as it is literally Demi&#39;s best lead single.😍
I remember watching this on vevo when I was 8 and jumping on the bed to it.. :P
I LOVE HER 🎉❤❤❤

cómo que no la canta David laid
2023 🔥
Since holding schedules often seem unreal at most Christmas times . Our last run with it was less hassling but more hectic just checking views . We apparently got busy on more occasional day then hikes furthering west .recent ones called us out revealing how tedious it’ll be ,. Well i guess better notions are more intuitive than reciting most dos for home keeping . We frequently use ornaments for decorations if the weather gets enough for Christmas. Bad seats often drift our reknown efforts towards having holiday gifts. The celebrations went quite well if every one did  their part . Running a timely campaign to promoting our community private sunctions we’re difficult .but it bring hope to ensure a difference between those around such revolving states .
Holidays  are gradually starting rowdsy. Ain’t no good lurking Karma deducing most things . We apparently can’t denied a awful scene but looks like this Christmas should go out good . Word blunts that the circle of conditions ain’t usually bright for us but that’s always a way for everything .just your doing alright persuading how things aren’t always our way . At least we’re still at surviving these years for another year . Hope you’re having a wonderful day and splendid time doing it . With the medias choice for befitting entertainment you ought to like .
Love you demi Lovato te amor ❤
When she was hot and not bat shit crazy
Saucy song, it&#39;s a vibe dancing to it and feeling good

This reminds me of the game episode
1 Timothy 4:1 (MSG)  The Spirit makes it clear that as time goes on, some are going to give up on the faith and chase after demonic illusions put forth by professional liars.
Genesis 6:6 (MSG)  God was sorry that he had made the human race in the first place; it broke his heart.
Slllllay been listening to this since I was 7
Quitando lo de chicas que se besan.

Temazo
this shi slaps
we were happy and we didn&#39;t know it
Has it really been 8 years? Damn how time flies
i like to listen to this song at 2am🤣🤣🤣
Yep this song is cool for summer . BUT ITS AUTUMN
I heard this song years ago on the radio and liked it at the time. But I never gave it much thought. I heard it again recently and decieded to look it up on YouTube.<br><br>I&#39;m not into following musicians or celebrities so I had no clue who DL was or what she looked like. But man..talk about beauty mixed with raw sexuality. Almost seems wrong for her to have such a great voice on top of it. 😂
como que es de hace 8 años? KHE
Cool for the summer en pleno 2023 y la sigue rompiendo temazo
G3
Say thanks to Taylor swift  for free promotion 😁
I love this song. i listen to it 1000000 times
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il9nqWw9W3Y&amp;t=123">2:03</a> is literally amazing
As a 23 year old blue collar, red neck, diesel truck repairman and bodywork specialist. I blame this song for being the reason im toxicly attracted to latinas and drinks that have 20 ingredients and dont taste like alcohol.<br><br>She was stunning when this came out when i was 15. And shes still stunning now.
Pornography 😮

TAY ROCKED THIS SONG
I was 36 years old when this joint came out.  Am I a dirty old man for thinking that Demi Lovato was drop dead gorgeous and sexy in this video?  I am a man who overall appreciates the beauty of Women, but at my old age of 44 I wouldn&#39;t date a Women younger than say, 28 years old.
I came here coz of my mother Taylor swift
Before she turned to smack I’d of rattled her
Clipe sensacional!❤
DEMIII

Cool for the summer
Hello 2024
Sorry being late for this great hit, Taylor’s reaction on VMA bought me here! Nice one ☝🏻
نصيحة اذا احببت اغنية سمعتها على التيك توك لا تبحت عنها في اليوتيوب لانك ستصدم مثلي 🤦🏻🌚كنت اضن ان صاحبة الاغنية كورية و جميلة و لطيفة لكن ضهر العكس 🙂💔
she&#39;s so hot
Después de ver a la Taylor peda vuelvo por acá 😂
Desde 2015 ouvindo essa, música boa não fica fora de moda.
Que hermosa concion😘
I&#39;ve listened to this song a few times, and I&#39;m just now realizing this is a Bicurious/ LESBIAN song. 😂
Ver a Taylor toda empoderada bailando esta rolita es adictivo !! 😍😍😍😍
Primeira vez por aqui,  fiquei curioso de saber como era as músicas dela , depois que ela cantou com a Luísa Sonza ❤
❤❤
Taylor effect
Estoy aquí por Taylor
