I humbly request to universal studio plz bring back  Chris Morgan as a writer &amp; James wan as a director for 2 last epic finale installments of  F&amp;F franchise plzzzzzzzzzzzzz don&#39;t ruin this Franchise 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Can somebody explain to me why when they start fighting, they did aim each others tool but not the body 😂
James wan the best director from the fast
Would of been better if it was filmed on top of a real car park not inside and in real life mr shaw would of won being a ex sas and best of the best solider
miss you,Paul😞😔
May Gods bless u people ❤🙏🏿🤍
Vin Diesel&#39;s performance is amazing because he has best acting in the movie
I love ❤❤❤family dom
does the car from vin diesel in the fight scene between dom and shaw really can do wheelies in real life?
love it
Behind-the-scenes images are as awesome as the chapters themselves. Both are the same.
Very interesting🤔

Both are very closely related
a 2.19 minutes les trapezes de vin diesel sont un peut gonflé faut arrete les connerie
Deckard shaw beat dominic toretto. Jason statham is the man of action in f-f.
The best Jason ❤️
まさかワイスピにジェイソンステイサム出るとは思わなかったから<br><br>出るって分かった時マジビビった！
É Jason statan eu Raquel Bezerra Moreira quero explicar para os teimosos que televisão é imaginação porque todos tem trabalho responsabilidade diferente todos os alimentos na mesa depende de trabalhador específico na área e os artistas são específicos para distraí a humanidade ok
このシリーズを観ていると、自分もハゲにしたらカッコいいんじゃないかと勘違いしてしまう
Jason is different level actor
In real scenario what you guys think will win?
💋🍼
Jason🔥
何を喋ってんのか全然わかんないけど<br>凄いかっこいいのはわかりました！
Dom: no family no everything
The most realstic fight 😍
เบื้องหลังที่ดีจะทำไห้ดาราดังมาก
Is that Scott Adkins at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09I6onjgNMc&amp;t=66">1:06</a>???

Why do we need CGI for this fight sequence ?
Jabardast action
So Hard
I like Dom&#39;s dialogue <br>The things about the street fights <br>The street always wins
Bu ne amk
Vin&#39;s voice is on another level

Don&#39;t only hope on the Government to respond to security matters and Economic growth, As an individual you should be safeguarded and also look for different business and trade not only waiting for the betterment of stock market activities, most important always save the little you can and think of what to do with it when it becomes good for capital because we all know that Government has failed us in aspect of security, economic activities and other trading system. <br>Start investing more and spending less now for a better tomorrow all you need is a trusted broker to assist you and manage your trading account Mrs Destiny is actually the best when it comes to cryptocurrency investment she&#39;s always available you can hit her up + 1..  7 ..  0..   2 .. 6 .. 0   ..2..  1   ..9  ..3  ..4

It’s interesting how Vin Diesel has a stunt man but Jason does not. Jason Statham doesn’t need a stunt man.

Vin diesel is overrated
Jason sthatham is best and best Martel artist in the world
Powerful film 🤙
Xhinos hijuepytas
ซอร์ตัวใหญ่ มาก
Maahn... More than the fight,the editing is superb 😎
映画の主人公と悪役が裏で仲良くしてるのっていいよね
These type of video (behind or making) loses the impact of watching films. Now whole world know that all movies makers just use Green Sheet not real places and sceneries.
https://youtu.be/ez15jqahEJE
Пиздец!Да где они такие ключи то взяли размером  51 на 75 😂😂<br>В ремкомплекты данных автомобилей стали производители ложить такие...Там таких гаек нету даже))
si le pusieran  sub. en español seia mejor
かっこええ
I am Groot!
damn, it hurts to see all these supercars get absolutely destroyed
Jason’s Death Race 1 is 10 times better than Any Fast and Furious movie !!! <br><br>I hate that studio didn’t consider that franchise seriously.
I just watch this movie because of Statham <br>He is really a man in action <br>1 of my Ideal Hollywood Actor<br>And i love his all movies....

Вообще обленились снимать фильмы все рисуют компьютерной графикой. Актёров тоже рисуйте тогда не надо платить им.
Vin diesel🤩🤩🤩
Furious 7 is the best movie of this franchise
God damn right it is🔥🔥
Jason statham der susarım
I nearly cried when i saw that Aston getting smashed but still my favourite franchise.

one of the best fights in the whole series
Mr. White ? Good damn right!
R.i.p. Paul waker😭😢
Nothing to say beside Awesome!!!!
He went from picking up girl to picking up cars.

Dekard shaw is my favorite fast and furious charecter
And then there&#39;s that beautiful Aston just chilling, destroyed in the background.
sha
I want to look how the black charger wheelie

Jason Statham (deckard shaw) should have won to be honest. He was a lethal SAS assassin ffs
my like.
Did anyone notice there was more fight scenes in Furious 7 than Captain America Civil War. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fightandfurious">#FightAndFurious</a>
They made ONE semi- decent movie....get over it.
Jason statham the best

I need /behind the fight scene with Jason statham vs Scott adkins in Expendables 2
very nice
Imagine all of this were real LOL
круто! привет из России...Стейтемушка и Вин круче всех.
To me. it looks more like a fight between 2 representatives of 2 different nations. Political Innuendo
did they have to learn their fighting moves in a choreography lesson and remember those parts before their fight scene; did the director or choreographer help them out right before they shot it?
Are you going to make more fast and furious I love them so much I watch them everyday 😄😄😄😄😄😄
win vin<br>lose jason
fucking scenes no blood in faces totally garbage
Are you doing more parts of this
