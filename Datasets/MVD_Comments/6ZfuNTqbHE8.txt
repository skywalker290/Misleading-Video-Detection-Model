My god even the piano gives me chills
It has been so long since this happened. But it still gives me goosebumps. Whatever it takes
Those were the days.
2024 attendance folks .<br>This is my fav movie .i know every character dialogues 🥺🥺🥺🥺💕 i love you 3000
Best Marvel movie by far !   I don&#39;t know what happened between this and End Game, but there was a shift.
What Hulk is doing in this trailer? 😅
Its 2024, clock showing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=211">03:31</a> and my brain told me to check this vid for the only-God-knows-how-many-times have I watched this majestic art 🔥
I don&#39;t know how many times that i have watched this trailer.<br>Truely one of the masterpieces so far
It’s still the Marvel of this period. It’s good to watch.
Tere kol karnapaer msg belitekar
Still gives me goosebumps 6 years later
Still the best MCU movie yet. It was so epic! Masterful trailer too
Peak Marvel
The greatest official trailer of all time.🤗
It was an event of a lifetime and now look at Marvel!
Anyone watching 2024?
Who else here in 2024?🫠🥲
feels  like jus yesterday i saw this trailer when i was  in the 8th grade. Now I&#39;m in college, nostalgia at its best , this movie will forever me attached to me forever ❤
Man to be in a theater and here that avengers theme starting a new chapter is gonna be awesome!!
Watching this in 2024😂⚡
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> Guys Hulk is literally running in his own look 😂😂
This will always be my favorite movie trailer of all time.😢
We need the MCU to be like this again!
This was my first ever theatre experience, what a masterpiece.
I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m crying ..😭
their purpose die with thanos
This trailer alone is better than all mcu phase 4 and 5
Time is gone 😢
This trailer still gives me goosebumps just like when I watched it at first.
Remembering the good old days before we got the marvels. Eternals and the rest of their agenda lead movies. What a time to be alive
lets just hope secret wars will also be endgame level
Kgf trailer 💀
I wish I could relive the hype for this
Listening to this bgm still giving me Goosebumps after freaking 6 yrs ❤❤❤
Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the universe…<br>…but this… <b>chuckles</b><br>…does put a smile on my face.
Take me back to 2018😢
Absolute/alternative/ultimate points of time.
Anybody in 2024❤
One of the greatest films ever
Idk how we went from so comic accurate and excited to scared and boring
Can anyone tell me why the hulk appears running with the Avengers when in the film he only appears as hulk against thanos
Watching this trailer in 2024
wait hulk ???? in wokanda ?/??but actual movie hulk in hulkbuster???
Man I wish I could go back and witness this moment again. 😭❤️

It doesn&#39;t always have to be witty and funny. I think Marvel has achieved success in this way with its serious and drama-based movies.

Mi infancia bro 🥲
Peak Cinema right here. This changed lives and changed the industry forever. Shame it&#39;s in the past, but i&#39;m glad i lived it.
That scene where they’re all running rowards the screen with the Hulk never happened 😢
best of the best
🔥🔥🔥
Anyone come in 2024 to watch this trailer 🥰
PEAK Era.
I&#39;m indian
This Definitely puts a smile on my face with some tears of joy n nostalgia (never been crazy to buy overpriced tickets first day first show expect here)
How do we go from this to what we have now. They threw it all away.
I&#39;d rather have teeth pulled without anesthetic than have to watch Marvel movies...
Wanda maximoff
Man I want travel back in time and I want to cheer for THANOS  in theatre...😁
6 years. Still feels like im watching the trailer for the first time ever.
LIFE WAS GOOD THEN
Hype engine blasts at infinity 😂😂❤
It&#39;s 6 years but Hulk was edited now also 😂
This was peak marvel everything fell off afterwards besides spiderman no way home
6 years?
Loved this 😢
I enjoy this trailer more than the mcu movie that come out after spider-man no way home
We need to ironman.Please
MARVEL JESUS&#39;S
Man that fake Hulk huhhhhhhhhh<br>Miss savage Hulk<br>And shut up banner
“There was an idea” To create, a pair of movies, To see if they could become, the absolute best.
2023 is the worst phase of the mcu <br>But am commenting on 2024 😂😂😂😅😢😢
mistake in this trailer hulk is not present in wakanda fight only banner is present in wakanda fight anyone notice this 😮
After watching a lot of crap from Marvel, I just forgot these movies still exist and are made by Marvel.
The only thing that would’ve made these movies better is having The Hulk be in them to his full glory … I’m still mad about that
I can&#39;t believe this is almost 7 years old and the movie itself is almost 6 years old.<br><br>Without a doubt the greatest cinematic event in history along with Endgame.<br><br>I was very fortunate to live this cinematographic experience back in the day.
This gives me so much nostalgia
I can’t believe it’s been 6 years already 😭
Nostalgic 😢❤
For those who didn’t experience the hype for this movie and Endgame a year apart and than go to the actual movie. Man those lines were long asf 🥹🫶🏾 glad I was able to see marvel since I grew up!
SIX years ago…<br><br>😭😭😭
i still get chills watching this 🔥😢
When is this movie coming out???
I miss the mcu...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> Hulk 😢

Waiting Avengers:Secret Wars
The excitement of watching both Avengers Infinity War/Endgame and Deadpool and Wolverine trailers are the same. I can&#39;t wait for another masterpiece. Thank you, Marvel! And I miss the OG Avengers TvT
According to my calculations, every single comment on here gets at least over 3 likes
Its 2024 and i still cant get over it
Remember when the MCU was actually incredible?
Best Marvel Movie ever made
I thought i had grown out of marvel and superhero movies but looking at the older movies and trailers i realise i am simply no longer a part of their target audience anymore.... idk whom the movies are for but it&#39;s kind of saddening
I still remember how I was hyped for this movie
I&#39;m still hyping
Alguien en Febrero 2024?

Disney ruined marvel
16/02/2024
Unpopular opinion: Infinity War is not just better than endgame but best MCU film.
2024, still the best of mcu.
True heroes are watching this in 2024
Fun fact they started planning this movie since 2012 when avengers 1 came out that’s 6 years of planning it definitely payed off

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=119">1:59</a> hulk really wanted to be in this scene even though the movie directors didn&#39;t.
Peak of Marvel

This trailer is unparalleled
❤❤ amo de mais os filmes da Marvel
Sometimes I come back to this trailer just to hear the music and MY GOD does it still hit like a truck full of concrete 😫
After rewatching this now i noticed 2 intresting things, they probably cut a dialogue between Bruce and Natasha at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=25">0:25</a>, its her arm at the left, probably to get rid of their romance in a more satisfying way unlike the final cut version, wich was just them look at each other for 2 seconds and then a joke.<br><br>And the ending scene of the trailer, that its not in the movie as we all know, looks like a alternative fight were they all charge together against JUST Thanos, that is not the location where they fight the army, its that forest where they fight Thanos, and notice that Thor isn&#39;t in it because he was supposed to show up at the end just like in the final cut.<br>But instead we got the one where Thanos stops them one to one because they attack him one by one, which was a terrible strategy, it was very lame and without the Hulk too, probably Hulk was supposed to exit the Hulkbuster by smashing it when he sees Thanos, then to get beat up again, to make the scene even more desperate.
who in 2024
This was literally the last great movie made. And End Game was the end of an Era!! I still can&#39;t believe it&#39;s all over. Anything after End Game was straight out trash!
Good🎉

Marvel was at its peak. I really miss the old vibe 🥹
&quot;Final stage&quot; feel is strong in this one

Bruh i still get chills from this man
Who is here in 2024?

Russo brother you guys are legends, you guys are reason behind i and lakhs of pepole like me started watching marvel movies and regrets every single time why didn&#39;t i watch this movie in theater. But still i love you alot. Love you marvel for giving us this masterpiece. Even after so many years this movie feels like home... love you marvel ❤

Marvel. Please for the love of all that is holy, return to this level.
Come back now &amp; then. Most watched trailer EVER! It&#39;s buried down there somewhere but I&#39;ll gladly repeat it as best I can:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=121">2:01</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=132">2:12</a><br>The moment DC realized they lost! 😊
Bro the best thing Marvel should do is have a repeat of Infinity war in Kang Dynasty (the hero’s getting whipped by the villain and they loose terribly ) and for Secret Wars they bring every single person who played a superhero role in Marvel or important role to fans back for the last time to defeat the villain and reboot the franchise at the end starting a new fresh universe it will be sad my brothers and sisters but this will still bring joy to my heart  a bitter sweet moment 🎉MARVEL 4 LIFE ❤
I&#39;ve watched this like 100 times and l still get the chills
Still get goosebumps everytime after watching this <br>It&#39;s been 6yrs but still feels like yesterday

Goosebumps all over again,Is this last such Movie we saw?<br>No Marvel please bring these avengers backs and use this BGM to create the magic one more Time.
Dread it , run from it , destiny still arrives 🥶🥶🥶
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=110">1:50</a> there&#39;s hulk in the background, proving that hulk was supposed to be there, but marvel decided not to put him in for whatever reason. Edit: mb its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=120">2:00</a>
This was the best Marvel movie ever made.
Wow 6 years ago
Crazy how marvel went from this to the crap we have now.
Best MCU movie to date.
Even in 2024 I still have goosebumps watching this trailer
I&#39;m from future Marvel<br>Plz make RDJ back if u don&#39;t wanna loss
The last good marvel movie
Infinity War was such a legendary movie that people come to re-watch it&#39;s trailer 6 years after its release.

No One Can Match this Phase!❤
The start of this trailer is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fue bonito ver a hulk en el tráiler mientras corre en la batalla
YOOO THE TRAILER IS SICKKKK! CANT WAIT🥶🥶🥶
Quand j’imagine encore que si Star Lord n’avait pas frappé Thanos, il n’y aurait pas eu de Avengers: Endgame.
Only the ones who lived this knew what was to experience this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> Hulk was there 😂
When you watch this in 2024 hits hard the fact that Marvel is trash rn
Still the best trailer ever 😮‍💨🔥
6 years ago 😳😳
Thats next level of Trailers
Still giving goosebumbs and still hyping us up. Thats how great this is
I laughed why Tony died.
&lt;/html&gt;
I don’t see marvel ever getting back to this but man was this perfect
Memories 😌, Can&#39;t wait for avengers kang dynasty and secret wars it may not be the same but at least they bringing old characters back. Possibly avengers 5 and 6 will get pushed back because of what Jonathan majors did.🥴

6 years ago omg. The hype and build up for this was jus amazing
Making this comment to return to it after they release the Dynasty trailer to see how it compares. See ya&#39;ll then!
MCU&#39;s PEAK
one of the epic movie of mcu :) still favorite🙇‍♂(2024).
Until they go back and see what they have done to from the past did keep people in suspense off the edge of the edge of the seat wanting more
You have to go back to school to get what you need so basically what the MCU need to do they need to go back to where they started to learn and get the idea and concept of what they have already done and add to what they&#39;re trying to do to make sure it goes what people enjoy and loved and add to what people are looking for in this time and what they&#39;re going to do to bring the same the Ed with the new that will bring epic enjoyable fantastic magnificent spontaneous
Until they go back where are they started in it all was just awesome Epic amazing fantastic everybody was in suspense loved it
Hi all.  I noticed a long time ago when the film and trailer came out.  Have you noticed that Hulk is running with the Avengers team against Thanos?
Всем привет. Я давно заметил когда вышел фильм и трейлер. Вы тут заметили что Халк бежит с командой Мстители против Таноса?
6 years? In that time, I&#39;ve changed so much that I&#39;ve chosen the Tokyo Revengers over the Avengers. I&#39;m an anime fan)
6 YEARS!!!!
6 years ago...still feels like released yesterday 😢
In 2024
Back when they reached their highest peak
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> v never saw this scene in the movie... Plus Hulk never turned green after he was humbled by thanos... I hate that moment.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=135">2:15</a> and guardians were not like that when thor was woked up 😂... They were holding guns &amp; knifes ready to fight.. They were like (anytime now let&#39;s begin)
Where were you the day Thanos...Snapped?
It’s 2024 and it’s still puts a smile on my face
6 years...
This trailer is perfectly balanced as all things should be
Movie name?????
Peak
goosebumps every time when i watching this trailer
Best Marvel&#39;s Movie of all Time  LEGENDARY FILM FOREVER
Did anyone noticed hulk at the end
Actual Hulk in the trailer... 🤔
Hulk???? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=119">1:59</a>

Hard to believe it&#39;s been 6 years
Peak.
An era has ended
I still remember the HYPE about this trailer, the leaks and the first thoughts, even i remember going out from the second time I&#39;ve watched the movie, a kid was crying because Spider-man died, i tried to cheer up him and i told him &quot;he will return on the next movie&quot; ❤
Who else is here after 6 yrs??😊
It&#39;s 2024 and Marvel has still yet to put out something that is as hyped up or enthralling as this trailer alone...
Its 6 years ago
2024 and this trailer puts a smile on my face
6 years and still here!! best trailer- movie
all marvel movies are good and i mean movie after movie i just cant stop watching
It’s really sad watching this with the current shambles the mcu is in right now
Endgame ended this legendry movie with some sad scenes like tony starks dying
Nothing tops this. ENDGAME was good but we already kinda knew the ending how it would turn out. NOW THIS HAD GAVE ME CHILLS the moment the movie was over .
I refuse to believe that this was 7 years ago 💀
❤❤❤
من أجمل الأعمال السنمائية <br>مزيدا من التميز ‏‪❤
This Aged Quickly…
6 years later and the still slaps
This was the true end for the MCU
This show is still good after 6 years and man if only hulk and that ending scene was to become a thing
i will never forget this dialogue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=60">1:00</a>
😢
Am i the only one who gets teary-eyed watching this amazing trailer? Endgame was spectacular. Let me just say that. Absolutely epic! But Infinity War; well, that was something different. Something special. I loved EVERYTHING about it. The stakes were never higher. It was an event unlike anything I&#39;ve seen in theaters since Jurassic Park in 1993, Star Wars in 1997, and Titanic in 1997. Movies this good do not come along that often. And when they do, you embrace it. It was an event that unequivocally NEEDED to be seen on the biggest screen, with hundreds of people in attendance.
Who came back in 2024 to watch this legendary movie trailer ?🔥💯❤
This is what Endgame should&#39;ve been. Not the time travel crap we got for a finale to the Infinity Saga.
2024?
I just came here to remind myself how glorious this franchise used to be before D+ and phase 4 sucked all of its magic out.
It&#39;s 12 January 2024 and this trailer still makes me feel good.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=102">1:42</a> Imagine you saw age of ultron and now you see vision getting attacked on his soul stone you will ofcourse go for the movie
Good ol&#39; Time
I watched the first Avengers trailer and then switched to this… i realized that it was an honor to be able to witness this all in theaters
This is by far the best marvel movie from start to finish
This trailer is so nostalgic 😢
ممتاز جدااا اتمنا المزيد منهااا لاباس به
Süper bir fillm
Guys, just notice the theme song and background music in the trailer, i can&#39;t comprehend the amount of nostalgia I&#39;m having right now, I&#39;m so sad this is over, i hope the future marvel gives similar vibes to infinity war, this was ABSOLUTE PEAK
How is this 6 years old, crazy!
2018: Is there anyone more powerful than Thanos? <br><br>2022: Is there anyone more powerful than Wanda? <br><br>2023: Is there anyone more powerful than Loki?
how am i seeing this in 2024 rn lol
Anyone here in 2024
Once upon a time Marvel 💔
Kalitesi mükemmel ve Geçişleri iyi düzeyde olmuş.
It&#39;s 2024, and this trailer is better than all the movies Marvel made after Infinity War
Good movie

I can&#39;t remember hulk in this movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=120">2:00</a> 🤔🤔🤔
That ending music… so good….
am i only one who notice hulk while they were running
It’s been six years and I think this Marvel’s best trailer ever. The hype was insane.
انهم يرغبون في مشاهدة المزيد من الافلام الأسطورية الجديدة من Marvel studios
I like this one ,thank u Tanos❤❤❤
2024, and still the most beautiful marvel trailer to ever exist🎉💯
Watched 2024 6 years those days of infinity war and endgame peak mcu literally what happened mcu after endgame except nwh and guardian 3 all movie cringe seriously what happened marvel studios
There should be an award for &quot;best trailer&quot; category.
watching again ryt now!!
one of the BEST TRAILERS EVER MADE
Any one noticed Hulk in back ground
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=90">1:30</a>❤
If you want to experience Goosebumps<br><br>Watch it again
6 saal baad recommend hua mujhy ❤
Marvel’s best movie to this day
😔: There was an idea.
Good vidéo ❤❤
We all still remember when the world stopped to watch this trailer right
فيلم أقل ما يقال عليه أنه من أفخم الأفلام الخيال العلمي ❤
After watching every marvel movie I believe they can’t top this level what a masterpiece 🔥
عمل ممتاز
Good ❤
Even the trailer had a great post-credits scene 😂 ... What a year
❤nice
The first time I watched this movie everyone left the cinema when it ended feeling like they had lost someone dear to them. For me it was like I had watched the death of the Incredible Hulk only it was a billion times more painful. I left that place knowing Dr. Strange had clearly given Thanos the time stone for a reason.
Masterpiece of a trailer! Masterpiece of a movie. The way they brought all those characters together. Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Black Panther, The Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Asgardians, Thanos and his Black Order all in one movie. Masterful storytelling, completely unprecedented.
6 years and still can&#39;t believe it has been 6 years !
جميل  راءع
My friend : you in the premier night right spoil me something <br>Me : everyone dies......<br>My friend : come on tell me something.....<br>Me : <b>look him in the eye</b><br>My friend : No.......
From the ingenious Captain America, tech wizard Iron Man, and powerful Thor to the always angry Hulk, immensely clever Black Widow, and conniving Loki, all the characters irrespective of being a hero or an evil villain have thoughts on how life can be and words that can get you through some tough situations.The end of Phase 3 brought all the heroes together to fight off one imminent threat. The Avengers banded together to defeat Thanos one last time and get back the blipped population. Tony Stark was the unnamed leader of the gang and always mobilized them to do their best, not knowing that this would be the last battle he would experience alongside his friends.
It&#39;s insane to me that this was 6 years ago now
Fun fact, they gave only Thanos the first 2 infinity stones just for this trailer and made Bruce being able to turn into the Hulk
For me this was the absolute best Marvel movie, even better than Endgame. <br>I remember the unreal hype like it was yesterday!
Its 2024 and this still gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.
2024
The best comic book movie there has been.
&quot;6 years from now&quot;
Anyone in Jan 4 3024
Any one here in 2024😅
a hell of a run, marvel 👏🏾👏🏾...never get tired of hearing thanos’ “quotables”.
It could be the year 2050, GTA 6 still won’t be out, but at least this trailer will always put a smile on my face.
I feel so unlucky that i couldn&#39;t got chance to watch this masterpiece in Theatres 😢😭😭😭😭  💔
marvel peaked here ?<br>no, cinema peaked here.
Who&#39;s here in 2024?
Watching this again and I just realized the beginning dialogue of this is the same as the first avengers movie trailer
I still remember the hype of those years
Peak Marvel 🤌
the amount of weight this movie had on release. how everyone tuned in for this, and both movies paid off. still chills
Achei mt bom esse filme, recomendo muito !
2024 and still can&#39;t get over the fact that marvel is over. The classic MCU experience was something else. It cannot be replicated.
Heck 6years😮ago
hi iam thamilan
Sheeeshhhh
أجل اعشق ❤❤❤❤
Why in Agent Of Shield Season 6 doesn&#39;t mention about the Snap?🤔
2024 2nd Jan bt this trailer amazing
Black Panther, we miss you buddy.
Who else is here in 2024? 😂
I wonder when the next big thing for a cinematic experience like this could come. For all I know, MCU is way far from regaining this kind of hype again.
&quot;And get this man a shield&quot; givies me goosbumps everytime
started 2024 with watching Avengers Endgame
Whos here on 1st January 2024?
Greatest part of the trailer is Hulk in Wakanda.
Infinity War was 6 years ago today. We&#39;ve.... grown up.
SddS
Happy new year ❤🎉
First comment of 2024
It’s 2024 and this trailer still puts a smile on my face
Rewatching this era of marvel was HYPE but I hope they get better releasing movies like back then
Who&#39;s here in 2024
2 days till 2025 n still watchin this
Avengers: Infinity War is one of the biggest Marvel movies and one of the best. Everything like the insane budget, the huge amount of incredible effects, music used epically, the crossover of characters, and consequences for once.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=119">1:59</a> me and the alt accounts coming to defend one of my homies <br>Also false advertising for the <br>combined it with the hulkbuster made it seem the avengers were United here because it seemed Ironman was gonna be in black panther land (yes I know the name )<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=119">1:59</a> me and the children in my basement trying to escape the hurricane back a while ago
Tes
Hell no, not yet!
I&#39;m curious if GTA VI trailer will beat this in views, honestly I don&#39;t think so but we&#39;ll see, it beat the Endgame already.
Duffman said it best
Which is better Infinite War or Endgame?
Back when the MCU was at its peak 😢
My old friends, Og Fortnite, peak mcu, peak Youtube, Infinity war, and my youthful childhood energy, this will be a time to remember
It&#39;s December 2023 and here I am watching this, even though the years have passed, this trailer still looks amazingly incredible, I wish the MCU would once again excite and surprise like before
6 years of Hulk Scam in this trailer 😂
فيلم جميل جدا لم أتوقع نهايته 🥰
❤😢
What ever happened to Marvel……
جودة عالية رهيبة واصل ابداعك ❤❤
Just end this awful multiverse saga and do the mutants like  the infinity saga
Without Iron Man Marvel is incomplete 🥺💫💔..
This trailer will always be remembered as the greatest goosebumps trailer ever.❤
El mcu tiene mucho potencial  para seguir dandonos tremendas joyas de sagas pero se les a ido de las manos
The Best Trailer of History 🏆
This trailer is probably the greatest movie trailer of ALL TIME!!!
Infinity War 👍<br>-----------------------<br>Endgame 👎
After five years things are not going well for MCU ... We re missing old times
Nothing in the MCU will ever top this point
I&#39;d Forgotten The Excitement Of Not Knowing, The Delights Of Uncertainty.
2024
Çok güzel
When marvel its on peak.. ❤️
life will never be the same
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=97">1:37</a> i used to watch that all of the time. I knew from that point the Avengers needed everyone.
6 years later and still the hardest movie trailer to ever drop
this trailer is better than 60 percrnt of movies....
Legend if you&#39;re here
Dread it Run From it Destiny Still Arrives Fuckin Goosebumps Righthere
Infinity war movie is a loop 😂
Peak movie, peak life
Pov : cuando marvel studios hacia buenas peliculas y no la basofia de ahora
ANYONE IN 2024💥
GTA 6 is coming for this trailer next
6 years 💀...
I was so happy spider-man was in this movie
mcu
Who is here in December 2023?? 😭
nostalgia ;;;;((}}
Peak of Marvel.
Whatever it takes.....
Best film at any time (2 days to 2024
Its an emotion it will be forever
Still full of body getting goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥....dread it run from it Destiny still arrives.....and get this man a shield 🛡️❤...and that background score just elevated whole thing
Infinity war alone was better than every Avatar movie combined 🤦‍♂️
Greatest Trailer Of All Time
W
After 6 years, it&#39;s still the best movie trailer I&#39;ve ever watched.
I hope Avengers 5 and 6 gives us chills like this, Kevin Feige is definitely working hard to get marvel back to what it was
Why is this so currently nostalgic? 😢
Esse foi o auge absoluto da Marvel, duvido muito que algum dia teremos algo nesse nível
Despues de 6 años vuelvo a ver el trailer de Avengera Infinite War, que me iso gritar de la emocion por querer verla ya en el cine!!!
best marvel movie hands down
Who&#39;s watching this in 2023?
pure goosebump trailer
Thanos is arguably the most charismatic villain in movie history. “In time you will know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, that to fail all the same. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.”
😢😢😢 I remember when I watched this film in theaters !COME BACK 2018!
This along with endgame and spider man no way home were the best marvel films made back in the days .
😢😢😢😢 someone give me a time machine
The next one is endgame
I still don&#39;t understand why is there HULK in thumbnail...
&quot;...so when they needed us, we could fight the battles, that they never could...&quot;
I’m sad it’s over but I’m happy it happened. We will have many more great experiences in our lifetime. We just need to accept change. I turn 18 in 30 minutes. Im ready for the adventure.
Only thing that would&#39;ve made this an even better masterpiece is having Hulk run into the battle in wakanda for a rematch
Até hoje eu lembro da primeira vez que eu vi esse trailer e da primeira vez que vi em casa sozinho, pareecia um retardado gritando, saudades...
&quot;As long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist &quot; the last words of wisdom from Thanos who predicted even Marvel&#39;s future decline 😂
This hands down the greatest trailer of all time I don’t care
Peak of MCU  ... never going to get anything near anytime soon ... even Avengers 5/6 ... The way it goes seems like that....
MCU is dead, DC here we come
Bring back Jonathan Majors he did nothing wrong, you guys kept josh brolin and Jeremy renner
This is the best thing marvel did.
This does put a smile on my face.
Still the best MCU trailer
This trailer reached 150M in 4 months, GTA VI trailer reached 150 in 10 days. That thing gonna be the greatest game till date or the greatest disappointment ever, No in-between
Nothing will ever be this hype again
Clear Endgame
It’s been over 5 years since this movie’s release now in 2023, and it was the greatest superhero release of all time. The hype, the timing and the execution. In one word PERFECTION. Back when marvel had its own fan base and not everyone knew about it
Still miss the old Marvel❤ dec 2023
almost 2024 still the goosebumps
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=119">01:59</a> the green Hulk running with his allies<br>never happens in the released movie.
Lol I never noticed that they show Hulk in wakanda, but hulk was no show in wakanda
This is one of the best quotes I&#39;ve ever heard from Thanos man. Why wasn&#39;t this in the movie???? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=97">1:37</a>
To think that me and my older brother watched this trailer together when it dropped and watched it in theater and unfortunately he’s no longer with us. It definitely changes the dynamic of watching it again
I know people who watched Infinity War in the cinema and they don&#39;t watch Marvel anymore, I think they are doing the right thing.
I hate myself for not being able to watch this movie in the cinema
It was the best production I&#39;ve ever watched in my life.
It&#39;s almost 2024 and this trailer still excites me
GTA 6 will eclipse this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=114">1:54</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=119">1:59</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=122">2:02</a> Like bro it’s 2023 and about to be 2024 and this still hypes me up I swear bro like this trailer will never fail me and this is the best avengers  movie that was ever created 🔥🔥🔥
I came here all along just to get some more of this
MCU died after Endgame period!
Bro don&#39;t be stupid he literally admitted dat in end game
Gta 6 trailer gonna beat it and become number one of most viewed  trailer of all time  its just matter of time
First trailer feeling after 5 years after the snap ❤
IM SO HYPED THIS LOOKS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
6 years 6 fricken years
Anyone help me with this<br>i&#39;m quite sure in this scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=109">1:49</a> Thanos had 5 stones?<br>Did they not reveal the other 3 stones on purpose or am i wrong?
The world needs REAL life Avengers like this ❤
I want this as a tattoo<br>Written in the font of everyone&#39;s lines<br>Samuel L. Jackson<br>Robert Downey Jr<br>Paul Bettany<br>Chris Hemsworth<br>Scarlett Johansson
Its been 6 years,but everytime I watch it,it gives me goosebumps ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Mallus come here
Dear Marvel entertainment...<br>We will see movies like this again??? Stop please with feminism fails
Still here🥺
How is thanos hardest quote not even in the movie
Art of making trailers- Marvel&#39;s
Still all these years later endgame and infinity wars trailers give me chills
After this and Endgame, the MCU was never the same or as good as it was.
Please come back RUSSO BROS
I miss how I felt when I saw this😞
OV MY GOD 6 yearsssss i can&#39;t belive thisss
This movie gave Thor justice ❤
Dang we almost won this war
❤
Re watch 2023 💚
The new generation of Marvel will likely never see another movie with this much hype behind it.  Sad
Nothing can match Infinity War, Endgame may have made more money but the hype that Infinity War created was insane.
Back in the day when all you could think about is when another Marvel movie was coming out
GTA 6 will break the record
Peak cinema
2023... Anyone here watching this masterpiece again???☠️😳
End game is better tho
Golden age of marvel
buuu
goosebumos throughout
Which is more epic, GTA VI or Infinity War? Apples and oranges. Also both insanely epic pieces of entertainment anyways.
End of 2023 and I still get chills watching this trailer
why hulk running out at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=119">1:59</a> he ain’t want no smoke in the movie 💀😂
PEAK MCU
Anyone2023 December ❤
Here to reassure myself on how brilliant Marvel was, compared to the torture it has become now.
Still gives me goosebumps even tho I watched it four years ago😭

Live peaked on Nov 29. 2017<br><br>Nothing in life gives me the same chills and hype like this anymore
Peak MCU. Peak Hero’s. Peak Villian. Peak Cinema.
You had to be there to understand the hype...

All time blockbuster trailer ❤
Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Infinity War Official Trailer is the first video I’ve seen from Marvel Entertainment and I WISH I saw all of the Marvel movies besides the Tobey Maquire Spider-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy movies when this came out. This was such an exciting time for Marvel that we may never get again.
6 years…
I wish a villain can come in and snap thanos back he was the real deal
Real data : KGF 2 is the highest ever watched trailer on YouTube 🔥
I&#39;ll be honest, I cry every time I turn on this beauty after all these years.
GTA VI has like double the like count of this now.. how long until it surpasses the view count?
Who’s here after GTA VI surpassed the like count?
6 years ago 😢😢😢
This trailer will forever stay in my heart😭😭😭😭😭
GTA VI &gt;&gt;&gt;

GTA 6 now surpassed this and became the most liked entertainment product trailer of all time. All in just 2 hours
GTA 6 trailer just surpassed this in likes
The best marvel movie
Solo me estoy recordando cuando lo<br>Vi por primera vez y tuve esa emoción ahora ya pasaron 6 años y anhelo una misma emoción igual.
This is something that has only been done once and will never be done again, MARVEL THE GOAT!!!!!!!
hypes me up every single time
In hate how they show the hulk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&amp;t=121">2:01</a><br>He&#39;s not in that scene in the movie.<br>Scam
GTA 6 will beat this Trailer
Who is here in 2024
When Marvel is at its Prime<br>And Endgame being its last part of a golden age era for marvel
Stilll fire and hits you in the feeels
Now that it’s 2023… I just wanna say; <br>I’ll never stop believing in that old fashioned notion, til the end of the line.<br>Assemble.
Any know  KGF chapter 2 ❤
The way Thanos drops exclusively cold quotes
I just realized the hulk is in the trailer during the last battle 😂
The best marvel movie of all time
6 years later I’m back just to watch this trailer again
Still gives me goosebumps after 6 years 🥶
Even MARVEL&#39;s trailers are better than any other superhero movie 🔥<br>But this is the end of the era after Endgame.... 😢
Good times :&#39;)

6 years later and this trailer still gives me chills
Is it weird that this was the greatest film of all time and basically the end of the Marvel and universe as a whole?
Нереально крутий трейлер👍👍👍
I return 6 years later to return to what made me happy as a child
Круте відео! Море вражень!
Великолепный трейлер. Дух захватывает.
6 years🙂🔥♥️
&#39;Marvel Studios Avengers&#39; залишив враження заворожуючою підготовкою до неймовірної пригоди. Вражаючі кадри, епічна музика та обіцянка захопливого сюжету роблять цей фільм обов&#39;язковим для перегляду для всіх шанувальників Марвел.
Hulk running in the trailer and not see him fight in this one killed me inside and then end game came snd im still death cause professor hulk is not what i envisioned but other than that best movies ever

Класний фільм!!всім советую
Really enjoyed the trailer for the film. Thank you Marvel for another masterpiece.
Зрелищно! Фильм супер!
Отличный сюжет
No way its been 6 years since this trailer came out
👌
It&#39;s time to move on from Marvel and Disney. They went on a path that&#39;s not going to change. Just enjoy the good times like this trailer. It&#39;s even better than Ant-Man 3 and The Marvels whole movies
Фильм замечательный🎉
Peak of cinema
6 years is wild!
Having the hulk in the trailer is the biggest rick roll in Cinematic history 😂
No way it’s been 6 years remember getting the notification for this
I don&#39;t and have never fancied Marvel but this trailer is just peak
Today 6 years, wow
This trailer came out 6 years ago today and I still get chills watching it
Cant believe its been 6 years since this trailer came out 🥹🥹🥹
Holy crap it’s been 6 years ALREADY!? It only felt like YESTERDAY. I remember sitting at home, going upstairs, and clicking on YouTube, and the first thing I saw on my recommended section was this masterpiece. I watched it and immeadiately it became my most anticipated film of 2018. Everything caught my eye and hyped me up, the visuals, THANOS, but most importantly seeing all of these iconic heroes finally team up. I remember doing the same exact thing for Endgame.<br>Good times, back when the MCU was at its peak and we could expect something good out of Marvel. This trailer IS and WILL FOREVER BE apart of HISTORY for eternity.
As someone who watched the first main movies, and was only moderately interested in the MCU, believe me, I felt the hype and epic-ness when this trailer finally dropped! I worked at a theater and all of us were so excited to see what happens, and even more for End Game.
I’m still hoping one day, just one day. The MCU will gain this type of hype again
Can’t believe it’s already been 6 years 😢
Thanos&#39; words - in time you will know  what it is like to lose... I feel he presumed the current state of Marvel. 😢
It&#39;s already 6 years after this Trailer Broke the entire Internet<br><br>And put the highest Peak of the Marvel Cinematic Universe 💙
Still chills
It’s been six years since this trailer came out. I still, to this day, get a chill down my spine when Thanos shows up. We all knew he was going to be a major threat. And he delivered, in spades.
This trailer was released on birthday no way 😀🎁🎂
Can’t believe it’s been 6 years already
this does put a smile on my face
Some people in my 6th grade class at the time tried to spoil it and i got pissed so i moved tables and then went and watched it
Maaan leaving it with the guardians just standing there smiling to finish off the trailer is underrated!!!
