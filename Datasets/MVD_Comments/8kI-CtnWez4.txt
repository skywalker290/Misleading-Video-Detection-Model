i feel so bad for connor trolololol
he heard that wall of flesh put u in hardmore so he thinks its the hardest boss
Pewds comment section has always been the worst for repeated comments 💀 🤣
&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;<br>Platera at the surface:💀<br>Moonlord:💀<br>Daytime EoL:☠️
Connor 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Pewds I hate the bats<br>Me 😂😂😂
meanwhile empress of light daytime :
i was so afraid to fight &quot;wall of flesh&quot; and i made so much preparation, at last when i fought it, it died under 2 minutes
Mechanical bosses, Plantera, Golem, EOL, Lunatic cultist, moon boi and greatest of them all SLIME KING left the chat.
Bro this is not hardest boss in 1st this is its moonlord its the world hardest boss ever!
fart   in jar hahaha
Hardest???WORLD RECORD???!!
Jesus pewds reached hardmode faster than me
No that not hardest boss it&#39;s the impress of light on day time
Wof on master mode: bonjour <br><br>Beenades: adios
&quot;That was four minutes!&quot;, &quot;He h h heeh h he he&quot;
Why pewd hate Connor
Society if Connor the Guide didn’t exist: <b>how do i craft the Zenith?</b>
Bro hates conner
This woukd have been much betyer without chat, discovering stuff like the wall of flesh is really fun and its much more satisfyijg figuring out how to kill these thigns yourself. Rather than having chat spoil everything and telling you exactly what to do
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1258">20:58</a> most brutal and tragic betrayal in history
He still doesn&#39;t know that he can just go through the door without opening ut
why does he hate connor so muchhhhhh

CONNER NOOOOOOO😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😢😢😢😢
Are we just going to ignore the fact that pewds did not know what aglet was even after p&amp;f did a whole bomb ass song on it ?
pewdiepie: hating on a fart joke<br><br><br><br><br><br>also pewds: <b>makes a game that is litreally about shit</b>
I enjoy this playlist so much
Connor&#39;s been through a lot man.
its not even the 5th hardest lol
egg
Why bro hate connor
The hardest boss isn&#39;t wall of flesh it&#39;s moon lord, duke fishron, empress of light
No its not the hardest boss the hardest boss was probably the twins and moon lord
hallo    By    Mrbin
Famous last words: &quot;ooo it&#39;s a dynamite, it go boom boom&quot;<br><br>yes felix, it go boom boom.
Honestly, Terraria has the worst backseat gamers.
Conner 💔

Empress of light: am i a joke to you?
Pewdiepie randomly developing his animosity towards Connor was funny.
Can&#39;t believe that there&#39;s still people commenting and watching
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=407">6:47</a> clearly he hasn’t seen that Phineas and Ferb episode
Queen Slime, The Mechanical Bosses,Plantera,Golem,Lunatic Cultist,The pillars,Moonlord,and Empress Of light is cry laughing
PewDiePie from the beginning would have made 3 episodes from this just off the fact he wasn&#39;t smart enough TO GO INTO THE HIVE
Well, thats not the hardest part, the hardest part comes after killing the wall
PewDiePie: wall of flesh is the hardest boss<br><br><b>Moon lord: you sure about that</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=174">2:54</a> he deserved it. he didn’t go in your house in part 1
It&#39;s the Hardest Boss in Pre-Hardmode Bro🗿
Calamity player: heh *smug
I beated empress of light first try
It&#39;s funny how he says it&#39;s the hardest and last boss of the game, he hasn&#39;t even seen half the game 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=16">0:16</a> “connor”
If you think, its boss hardest, just try to defeat Impress of light, at the day
That wasnt even Connor.... Connor died sometime last episode I think
Still waiting for pewds to finish the game

SO YOURE TELLING ME CAPTIAN SAPRKLEZ STARTS TERRERIA AND THE YOU DO THIS IS AWESOME
sadly
why connor
“This game is adorable” <b>fights a literal wall of flesh a few minutes later</b>
you&#39;re on easy mode and what about empress of light no hit????
Epic! He went into hardmode with 0% preparations! But since he defeated the bee and the thicc wirm without an arena is a sign that he is a &quot;veteran&quot;
Make the strongest sword of terraria
Pewds I beat the hardest boss <br><br><br>Literally every Hardmode boss “ima end this man’s hole career “
Yo
&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;<br>Hardcore bosses be like: <b>&quot;art thou challenging me&quot;</b>

Poor Connor we will miss you:(
you know that wall of flesh is gonna spawn if you throw the voodoo doll in the lava
&quot;you dont even hurt! You bastard little turd!&quot;
Every time pewdiepie swears, it sounds he’s dropping the base
Currently binge watching watching early Terraria vids of Pewds. Can&#39;t wait to see him know suffering on Master mode because the game is so easy in Normal mode. Hahaha
Levi be like O.O who is connor
it is NOT the hardest boss

Empress Of Light?

PewDiePie:I beat the hardest boss!<br>Moonlord and empress of light:how about no
Te r r ia r i a
I never watched this series because I thought I did not like this game. Now I am addicted and I went back to this. I thought maybe I could get some inspiration on how to kill the moonlord but unfortunately you stopped playing pretty early in hardmode... 🥺 What a pity. I actually don&#39;t know how far you came in the livestream part of this series but I am not a member so I can&#39;t watch. So I wish you a good start and time in Japan and hope that maybe you get back to terraria 🤣
Poor Connor...
He never even beat the moon lord
Can you do anything
The hardest boss huh?
Thank you cause when I saw the thumbnail, my mind told me to play terraria
Pewds: I beat the hardest boss first try<br><br>Me: ever heard of skeletron prime?
pewds i have done everything <br><br>the 50 other bosses  thats cute
Pew pew: i beat the hardest boss 1st try!<br><br>Duke fishron: thats fun<br><br>Moonlord: thats cute<br><br>Empress of light: thats <b>adorable</b>
p
Make another video on terraria plz
hài quá
Rip the guide didn&#39;t even do anything, the bunnie DeShawn, and Connors being bullied for it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1245">20:45</a> I want to say this but with a different reason it&#39;s just so satisfying when he says it it makes me feel relaxed
“get the freak outta my house i’m playing terraria” 😂
We want expert mode...
i spent a week of my life trying to craft the nights edge
Skeletron
And skeleton and eye of Cthulhu
I kill the wall of flesh
Pls... play terraria again pewds

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1348">22:28</a> song name?

Pewdiepie: Immunity to poison. LAME!<br>Ankh charm: Am I a joke to you?
waith wof isn&#39;t hard if u know how
It&#39;s funny how he just bully conner
Me with solar armor and the zenith, &quot;did someone say queen bee&quot;?
i defeated wall of flesh using 200+ beenade and made me lag.. but still i defeated it
But now u get hell stone ore and I don&#39;t know how to craft hellstone bar its the update shit
“I beat the hardest boss”<br>Empress of light: are you sure about that?

I miss terraria before the update
Pewds: apart from you Conner<br><br>&quot;Conner&quot;: Levi <br><br>This was at the start  before he fought wall of flesh
No hate to minecraft but ay in minecraft can you get meteorite space armor and shoot a bunny with a musket exploding it into little pieces? Didnt think so lmaooo
Every time he kills a bunny i cant help but think of that vegan teachers glowing review of his channel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=187">3:07</a>:<br>U.S cops
I wish he could play this again
For me the hardest boss is the “empress of light” in day time. I think the moon lord is more easy on insane mode
Me: sees title<br>Also me: <b>What about daytime Empress of Light?</b>
PewDiePie is false advertising
F in the chat for us Connors
Hardest boss? <br>Moonlord: an I a joke to you?
hej monica
pweds: i beat the hardest boss<br><br>ah, if he just knew...
.. Mans is flaming LEVI WHEN HE CAN SLICE TITANS AND THINKING HE IS CORNER.
Pewds: i beat the hardest boss on terraria<br><br>Me who beat empress of light on day: what did you say you little shit
“Im from the hood mutha fricka” I love you pewds no homo but you make my days better :3
When you beat what you think is the hardest boss but then sometime later you realize the enemies are now tougher than the boss itself

Lmao Wall of flesh is considered the hardest PRE-hard mode boss but it’s not the HARDEST boss
He was noob
Hold Up! Since when did Pewds started playing Terraria!🤣
Haha. He entered hardmode, but he discontinued the gameplay. Ironically, he has the no legs gang Moon Lord figure at his desk, even though he wasn&#39;t yet fighting the rest of the hardmode bosses, even Moon Lord and events...
Piediepie: I heated the hardest boss on first try<br>Obsidian Time who killed him on expert mode without getting any damage at all: laughs in Russian
pewdiepie = 🙁 pew the pie =😎😎😎😎😎
Ayes the &quot;hardest boss&quot;
i beat wall of flesh 10 time&#39;s
I&#39;m a master of terraria
Connor probably has depression lol
Poor connor r.i.p
Uh... connor is now Levi....
Pewdie: What&#39;s this? hellwing bow..<br>TRASH WHY DID YOU GIVE ME TRASH-
Pewds: i beat the hardest boss <br>Day eol : am i a joke to you
As a terraria veteran this puts a tear in my eye. The experience of playing this game for the first time was so wonderful and to see pewdiepie feel that same thing is awesome
im really waiting for the hardmode episodes of this terraria series but still waiting
empress of light is waiting
Almost got messed up by a boulder trap and doesn&#39;t even know it
The doll is something about the npc that kills the npc
Ayo i beat both destroyer and the twins 1st try clutch on health on twins with deadalas storm bow and i got it on 2nd try 1st ded and cheesed the destroyer of worlds
When you think wall of flesh is hard
pewdiepie: i beat the hardest boss in terraria empress of light in day: SUPRISE MOTHER FUCKA
i defeated wall of flesh easier than him lol in first try
Not a world record, he&#39;s really good and all but it&#39;s not a world record, many people have beaten him first try like I have. Not here to spread hate just saying...
Im beat the hardest boss 1st try and me and hardest boss we both die
I started watching pewdiepie when I was twelve. Now I&#39;m nine.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=350">5:50</a> the moment he knew. 😌🤣
Pewds: I defeated the hardest boss!<br>Destroyer,twins,Betsy,queen slime,skeletron prime, plantera, golem,duke fishron, lunatic cultist, empress of light,mothron, dreadnautilus, frost legion, Santa NK1, ever scream, ice queen, mourning wood, pumpking, Martian saucer,  Flying Dutchman, sand elemental, moon lord, solar,vortex,nebula and solar pillar and goblin summoner: that’s cute
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=16">00:16</a> that’s not choner that LEVI
Someone should of have told him to equip it and hit conor

Pewdiepie: i hate you conner<br><br>Hard mode: allow me to introduce my self
connor goes swimming in the lava
There are like 8 more bosses lol.
This chad beats the wall of flesh on episode 5
Aww PewDiePie killed the wall! I&#39;m so proud of him, but good luck with Moon Lord.
Duke fishron) PITHETIC
(Moon lord) weak
moon lord is mad now
Flare guns r for light
Hey PewDiePie 1 tip u need a bee grenade so wall of flesh can be easier to kill
I beat the moon lord with Zenith i got every achivement to
Why did the bull watch hentai?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>He heard of…<br><br>Rule thirty HORN
At least with my skill set, wall of flesh is definitely the hardest and least fun boss.<br><br>Edit: Refighting it is also almost as annoying as the moon lord.
Honestly I’ve had over 100 hrs on terraria and I did the same thing he did with water this morning
Also for anyone in 2021 the hardest boss is Empress of Light now.
Who&#39;s gonna tell him that this isn&#39;t the hardest boss in Terraria???

Anyone 2021?
my guide&#39;s name was also connor but i treated him like a fucking god like if there was a blood moon i would do all i could to protect him
i like how he beat every single boss first try except king slime
pewdiepie: Wall of flesh is ez<br>pewdiepie + water = PewDiePie: I ded
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1303">21:43</a> I am utterly disturbed. I really don&#39;t wanna do this to my guide who&#39;s been there for me since day one.
Fun fact Connor/Guide is Wall of flesh
<b>Hardmode Bosses : *im boutta end this mans whole career</b>

Wait till he fights moonlord
is it just Me or i cant watch the 7sh episode of pewdiepie playing terraria
Hahhaha the wall of flesh lol your gonna in counter the moon lord later it has like 5m health so good luck and the world record is 0.7 seconds to beat it
Felix: you can leave connor<br><br>Connor: my name is Levi
i notice connors already even before he beat the wall because the guides name there is levi
If you will have de blood bucher den kill de giant eye
This is not the hardest boss
Lmao all the kids in the comments saying they&#39;re better than Felix because they know a little about Terraria
where do bad people go <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=30">0:30</a>

&quot;You cant hurt what is already fill with hurt&quot;<br><br> <del>PewDiePie</del>
As being named Connor this playthrough has been... rude.
<b>cough</b> <b>cough</b> mate idk how to tel lyou but that nightvision helmet you put it in the helemet thingy not on the middle thingy
you sure its the hardest boss?
Noob!
When i saw him get water walking boots i was so mad i was looking for those for hours to make terraspark boots. If anyone has a good underworld mob farm that works pre hardmode that would be great. (I need obsidian rose)
ISNT A AGLET THE THING ON YOUR SHOE 🧐🧐🧐
CONNOR DIED HIS GUIDE IS NAMED LEVI WTFFF
more like debeeted
i like how he found the hive immediately but he didn’t break in
terraria good
I love him for bring the game so much attention
&quot;hardest&quot;<br>u forgot: Moonlord, skeletron prime, mechanical worm aka The destroyer, empress of light etc.
All people:  first
MARIZA CHECK WHATSAPP

You can duplicate stuff
I laughed so hard when he said &quot;blood butcher&quot; LMAO
Pewds: “I beat the hardest boss”<br><br>Chat: “there’s more bosses”

Hey mastermode came by and he was wondering where pewds is can you find him?
Coner had sacrifice him self so u progress
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1260">21:00</a>😭😢 😔😔
Wall of flesh is not hard at all and not even the last boss in terraria
Сарк
“I beat the hardest boss!”<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Queen Slime,The twins,The destroyer,Skeletron Prime,Plantera,Golem,Duke fishron, Empress of Light, Lunatic Cultists,Pillars,Moon Lord, Other bosses from mods and others I may not know:
“I feel like I’ve done everything in the game” <br>I want to see him kill the moon lord
Lol he died on a toilet
This dude should play calamity or thorium
I know this is late but wof is not that hard
A star cannon is OP on the wall of flesh,maybe next time u can use that it will b faster
Pewds: i beat the hardest boss on the game!<br>Moon lord: <b>MENACING INTENSLY</b>
The name of his guide now is<br>LEVI
How tf did pewdiepie beat queen bee 😂
Pewds: I BEAT THE HARDEST BOSS<br>Me and other Terarian vets: no
Minecraft when your bored: afk farms <br><br>Terraria when your bored: “lets go to hell gamers”
Congrats you defeated the wall of flesh
W
nice! now your missing to beat the Twins, Skeleton prime, the Destroyer,  Plantera, Queen slime Empress of light, Golem, Duke Fishron, Lunatic Cultist, and Moon Lord :)
Pewds should play modded terraria
It’s funny how he has to kill moon lord and he says he beat the hardest boss
The flashback moment of Connor was enough to make a grown man cry.
I did it first try but I was on like one heart
Tirraria
In the
I got big house $$
I was crying when Connor died he had a bad life and the editing made it worst for him
That sad montage got me laughing so hard
Really hardcore  terraria player are cringing at pewds being a noob
Oy got quick tip:get 2 or more items<br>Then split them your item will increase
Is no last boss
My guy the hardest is moonlord
If i could play with pewdiepie i would give him a zenith or the solar flare set
he put the night vision goggles in vanity...
Me a summoner main pewdiepie uses bee armor for MELEE my cringe level: ITS OVER 9000
Can you pls play terraria again😭🥺
Pewdipie:night vision is a lie. When he had it in the vannati slot
i used a random tp potion and i spawned in a beehive and accidentally spawned the queen bee
Why are the comments in here are recents?
Dude pewdiepie thats not connor thats levi
&quot;The hardest Boss&quot; <br><br>So who&#39;s gonna tell him?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=188">3:08</a>  <br>American police
You can summon the Qween bee in the jungle
Hahahah he thinks the wof is the hardest boss! Wait till he fights skeletron prime or the twins
Pewdiepie: &quot;I dont know why it&#39;s so funny, it&#39;s like guns in minecraft.&quot;<br><br><br>*Terraria ranger class has left the. chat.

When your names Connor 😔
Thats not the hardest boss
Felix in the jungle be like<br><b>where bee</b>
Who should tell him that that was one of the easy ones and that there are more to come
Hardest uh um its empress of light
Making my way down town Conner took my kids I’m gonna jump off a bridge dadadadaddada
the wall of flesh  is easy
PewDiePie says I have nothing else to do like bro ur like 1/5 complete with the game
Nice summoner build.
Такое странное чувство когда прошол террорию и смотришь как другие проходят её
and that the first try
and NO the moon lord is not the best boss its the emperiss of light
and i beated the best boss without to die
there are more bosses in the game that was just the BEGINNING
?
PewDiePie: Uses Jump boots   <br><br>Me: Uses UFO, Hell Goat and pirate ship to fly.
Whats difficulty is he playing?
I beat the HARDEST Boss on 1st TRY! Translation: I beat the wall of flesh on Normal mode (easy mode) first try
Pewdiepie: I beat the hardest boss on 1st try<br><br>Moonlord:am I a joke to you

Imagine not playing on master mode.
title: i beat the hardest boss!!<br><br>moon lord: are you challenging me?!!?
its so annoying to watch him play cause hes such a noob
The guide&#39;s names levi so pewds killed connor offcam?
Dumbi
It’s not the hardest and I have world record for 5 seconds
terraria watches aot
Pewds:i beat the hardest boss!!😎 moon lord:time to die!!😡 calamity mod final boss:all of you are weak! <b>shoots lazer at pewds</b>
Watching Felix start as melee, switch to mage, switch to Ranger, switch to Summoner, then switch back to Melee is driving me insane.
Also keep fighting queen bee cuz it has a small chance of giving u honeyed goggles which summons a fast flying rideable bee
Also keep that poison immuniy ting, because later it makes the op ankh shield. Using ur shield, that, and other random things
Never Thought there could even be 1 mil views on terraria terrria, pewds got 6 mil
PewDiePie is the god of gamer LOVEEEE YOUUUU PEWDIEPIE
Ikea tower looks like a d*ck and you can&#39;t unsee that
You need a new editor bruh. Miss the old pewds vibes
On a Switch you need 20 hellstone bars to craft the phoenix blaster
I beat the wall of flesh first try too but i died once
There is a thing in the snow that has two life crystles and a chest
The hardest boss you say?
Moonlord: am i a joke to you?<br><br>Duke Fishron: WHAT?<br><br>Pewdie:<br><br>Everyone reading: WTAF is this guy saying ?<br><br>Dunno <br><br>But thx for reading XD
probaly the plantera is stupid
Little did he know that was just the beginning...
Mate that&#39;s not the hardest boss
Felix got the compass, we know what this means... He&#39;s gonna luck his way to getting the cell phone.
Poor connor
You need to have explosive bunnies in a cage to instakill it
Fitst off hes not hard second off not world record
IS HELL BATS AND LAVA BAT
Every other boss in hardmode: am I a joke to you?
Get the axe
Pewds: “Hardest boss”<br><br>Moon lord: “Ima end this mans whole career”
PETA when they don&#39;t get anyone to stop eating meat: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=288">4:48</a>
Connor is the new water sheep
Why does Felix hate me so much D:
Boomstick will forever be in my heart.
and NPCs does not want a crowd place there must be 3 NPCs in their respective biome to be happy enough to get a prylon
that is NOT the last boss,prepare yourself to battle moon lord
Oof we had the same health
It&#39;s not a lie you put it in the vanity slot

I feel so bad for the guide):
<b>proceeds to look away with 5 moon lord corpses in hand</b>
Felix’s second Terraria run in 1.4 ended up the exact same way as his first run: Barely progressing in hardmode after failing to defeat a mechanical boss.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1257">20:57</a> Damn that&#39;s emotional
Moon lord is harder idוot
Pewdiepie: I HAVE DONE THE HARDEST BOSS IN THE GAME!!!<br><br>Veterans: there is another
It isn’t the hardest try moonlord
He hasn’t even scratched the surface of hard mode<br>Pewds there more to the game search up all terraria bosses and you’ll see there’s more after the wall of flesh
“Hardest boss”
Poor Connor...I cried ;(

The queen bee is in the hive and there should be a blob of honey with something that looks like a bee in it break it to summon queen bee or use abeenation.
He calls Levi the guide ‘Connor’
how do we break it to him that fleshy boi is not the hardest boss
C’MON IS THIS THE END OF THE SERIES?! YOU HAVEN’T EVEN BEAT THE GAME YET!
Im a veteran and i feel insulted
for me its the most basic boss just like the eye of chulchu lol
espera pewdiepie juega esto
well wall of flesh is the hardest pre-hardmode but i fucking hate ocram
and also watch out for traps and dougong traps  there is lots of traps
pewdiepie the visions are suppose to go on the armor side LOL you suck at things I&#39;m smarter I killed eye of Cthulhu and king slime and I also beat skeletron I have the best things

Pewd : i beat the hardest boss<br><br><br><br>Me : CONNOR PREPARE THE MOON LORD
This video still has one of my favorite editing styles

Killing bunnies is cruel. Period.
I can beat wall of flesh in two hits with my terra blade
Who&#39;s Going To Tell Him
PewDieDiePie: <b>I BEATED THE HERDEST BOSS IN THE GAME</b><br>me: <i>there is another...</i>
Making my way down town with my Bitch shes gonna make me a sandwich tananananana
The title&amp;thumbnail clearly hasn&#39;t seen the moon lord

LMAOOOOOOOOOO dude we should play some time
Hey, when I was fighting WOF, my heart literally pounds every time the scary boi came.<br>My heart rate must be 200 BPM from that<br>Screw hard mode man,
The hardest is empress of light
I’d beat calamity death mode every boss with a bubble gun I am exasted
Terraria is Minecraft but you downloaded 2000000000000000000000 mods
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1234">20:34</a>
lighting boots ah yes
The sonic drowning music is so intense
R.i.p guide we&#39;ll never forget you
I hate u so bad BRUh why u insult Connor when he sacrificed himself to let you pass to hardmode and finish the game
When your name is Connor 😭😭😭😭
Man blew up the biggest vein of platinum I&#39;ve seen in my entire life lmao.
so i watched episode 4 got confused so espidoe 4 was 3 3 was 4 to it like this 1 2 4 3 5
The title made me laugh. Boi I killed the wall on my first try in 1 minute and 34 seconds
this guy looking at crafting recipes is like watching bob ross
You can get the broken hero sword by going into a solar eclipse you can summon it by go ing into a jungle temple you can go into it if you defeated the plantera
Mans got mage armour with the muramasa and Phoenix blaster
PewDiePie u know that there is the mech bosses all the way to moonlord right
Your so dumb the wall of flesh is not the hardest boss after wall of flesh is twins destroyer and skeletron prime
Pews I beat the hardest boss. All the veterans that beat moon lord in 15 sec be like. (;-;)
He just died like now😂😂😂
“I beat the hardest boss”<br><br>Duke fishron: Am I a joke to you?
Why mr beast has much much more viewers than pewdiepie
Wow... I haven’t seen a normal mode playthrough in forever. I went expert, then master mode. Never looked back. It looks so easy... like, the queen bee just went down like that!
That&#39;s not the hardest boss 🤣
He&#39;s swearing 🤬
A flare gun doesn’t do anything
Pewds: &#39;now its time to die.......... which I never do&#39;<br><br>me: &#39;Really?&#39;
Pewds: “I feel like I’ve done everything”<br>Vetarens: Have you beaten it in Expert mode didnt think so
You dont have pets that fights for you
you need kill the wall of flesh to even more enimes mech bosses rich to kill plantera to get broken hero sword
me first watching him play terraria: <b>pathetic</b><br>me when i see him beat WOF on first try when it took me 6 years: <b>he is the chosen one he will bring balance.</b>
at about 2 thirds in, I wonder if anyone will be watching this on Xmas day after eating Sprouts, beans &amp; Cabbage, no to mention ...
&gt; is not using any magic weapons<br>&gt; is using muramasa and phoenix blaster as &quot;main weapons&quot;<br>&gt; should probably be wearing either shadow armor or necro armor<br>&gt; is wearing an incomplete set of meteor armor anyway
W
It&#39;s been exactly one year since this damn...
Me have zenith
Pewdiepie u did not beet the hardest boss u beat the wall of flesh which gets u into hard mode that’s the easy bit now comes the mechanical bosses and then planterrera and then golem then the lunatic cultist the 4 pillars it think it’s for and then the final boss moon lord / Cthulhu himself and then u beat terraria here’s a tip to get further u know those demon alters / crimson alters smash them with ur pawn hammer and then you world gets blessed with a new hard mode ore :) Please read this yep it was long sry

Pewdiepie: I beat the hardest boss<br>Moon Lord: am I joke to you<br>Supreme Calamitas:what the fuck
Pewds: fights ancient astral horrors with the thirst for chaos and destruction<br><br><br>Also Pewds: pulls out a glock and starts popping caps
he did not beat it n the first try if you look for a second when he hoverd over the npc its name was levi not connor
Fucking forgot how easy none expert or Master Mode is
Enraged Empress of light : Pathetic.
Bruh wall of flesh is the hardest pre hard mode boss. You just finished the first stage of the game pewds. You got to kill moon lord to actually beat terraria
why you still use auto cursor tho. pewds sus
i think Queen of Bees was deBEEEEEEEEEEted
I got t-series ad on pewd&#39;s vid...wth

saddest thing in the pewdiepie channel:Conner Died
pewdiepie:finding queen bee<br><br>Me:Pewdiepie didn&#39;t see the bee hive
Pewds: I beat the hardest boss on first try.<br><br>1.4 enraged empress of light: 👁👄👁
And kill wall of flesh

Hellwing bow is not trash
Because you won its not in expert

This hurts to watch but also makes me smile from how innocent and unknowing he is.
He said &quot;water walking potion&quot;<br>Not &quot;water walking boots&quot; 😀
Me: <b>sees the title</b> <b>laughs in post moonlord</b>
Do you peolple know how sad the other youtuber&#39;s are because pewdiepie has a lot of subs and likes. Huh?.
In the last episode he called connor a scumbag for leaving
bruh mining bats?
R.I.P. Conner.
Ranger is a pretty class
&quot;I hope it doesn&#39;t break it.&quot;
Hahaha Conner is in my class
Felix: &quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;<br>Wall of flesh: Haha f*k u mate there&#39;s more than meets the eye.<br>The other bosses: Aight time to f*k &#39;em up &gt;:)
“I beat the hardest boss” wait until he sees the solar pillar and the moon lord
And he is not the strongest pewdipie try to compare yourself to last prism or 1.4&#39;s zenith
He called himself the strongest thing but keeps on dying

Hi Pewds, I&#39;m ur Russian bro
We have all gotten the bunny banner. You are normal...
Oop well if you if he thinks the wall of flesh is the hardest boss he’s gonna have a rude awakening lol
“I beat the hardest boss”<br><br>70% of bosses both modded and vanilla: 😀👍
He killed Conner with the fight in the beginning of ‘this vid Conner name is Levi not Conner so pewds a bitch
Pewds: the hardest boss is wall of flesh<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Crys in dungeon guardian:
Pewds: wow molten armor is very good<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Solar armor: hold on
The fact he said the HARDEST boss in terraria. Someone tell him about moonlord and duke fishron
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=1000">16:40</a>
Pewds: Whats an Aglet?<br><br>Phineas and Ferb fans: you need to learn
He didn’t make the fiery great sword!!!!!!!!
Bro its not the hardest boss its easy, even destroyer is harder than Wall of flesh
The hardest boss is the the twins <br>Empress of light moon lord <br>And skeleton prime
For me, queen bee does 3 damage to me but the hive I had was almost all honey so I had to build platforms mid fight
this is so fucking POGG, ilove teraria i have like 300 houres on it
Bruh it’s been 5 episodes and he already has way better stuff then me, I know this was 10 months ago but all I’m saying is that he started way better then I did lmao💀.
&quot;i beat the hardest boss on the first try&quot;<br><br>moon lord and empress of light: <b><i>hardest?</i></b>
&quot;Wall of flesh is the last boss&quot;<br>Every terraria veteran ever: Well, yes, but actually no.
Actually wall of flesh is not the 1.3.5 hardest boss
umm i defeated wall of flesh on my first try using beenades
&quot;I beat the hardest boss&quot;<br><br>* laughs in light empress *
&quot;I beat the HARDEST Boss&quot;<br><br>Every hardmode boss, especially Moonlord: Are we a joke to you?
if you listen close he says cheezus instead of jesus
NOOO CONNOR!
You should get the bee armor and the bee gun with the bee staff. Really cool and is good if you have infinite mana. It will DESTROY the king slime and weaker bosses
Now I watch this series to see pewdiepie teach me how to play terraria
Moreeeeee
!!!!!!!!!!
Nice
He needs to meet dungeon guardian which in my opinion is harder then moon lord cuz if your using celestial armor and for me beating him took me four in game days to kill him
Terraria Veterans: Laughs in Moon Lord
Pewdiepie fist part: <b>kills rabbit</b> I’m so sorry, I won’t do it again!<br><br>Pewdiepie now: <b>LITERALLY SHOOTS A RABBIT WITH FIRE GUN</b>
Is it me or does the Phoenix blaster look like killer beans pistols?
The wall of flesh is the easiest boss in terraria
Press u d-head u r such an idiot u needed to mine the honey to find bee
thats nowere neer the hardest boss
should we tell him...
Pewds: &quot;WOAH THATS FUCK*NG<br>MASSIVE DUDE WOAH!!&quot;<br>Zenith: &#39;¿_&#39;
i miss watching ur terraria vids
E
This video destroys my sanity
Conor is ninja,s brother i guess
And thats not the hardest boss there is still moon lord twins and more bosses that are harder than wall of flesh. also that there is people that beat the bosses at spawn kill
He has no nights edge
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=278">4:38</a> welcome to the club buddy, we all fell for that lie
Pewds/Felix: i beat the hardest boss<br><br>Moonlord, duke fishron, empress of light and queen slime: are we a joke to you?

Pewdiepie the world record is in one day
Theres 2 bosses in da jungle <br><br>1. Queen bee<br><br>2. Plantera
I beat the <b>hardest</b> boss!<br>Well yes but actually no
i guess the hardest boss of this series is cancellation
You need lava charm to easily get hell stone
the wall of flash is a easy boss and have the hardmode bosses
He did not realize he would have an ank sheild, soon<br>The beaozour,, uhhh<br>And the cobalt and obsidian shield
As a veteran terraria player, pewd’s lets play is kinda infuriating haha
“ I beat the hardest boss 1st try world record “ <br>Me with 100 beenades: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
Hey if you need help come join me I have a whole bunch of stuff you can get wings,OP weapons,and broken hero sword!
Moon Lord is the Strongest boss Not WoF

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=16">0:16</a> who else realized that the guide&#39;s name was replaced to levi instead of connor?
When in the bee hive i have been laugh to 5 minute🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kI-CtnWez4&amp;t=660">11:00</a> THAT VOODOO DEMON IS TOO FUCKING CLOSE TO LAVA GGOODDAAMMIITT
Hahahahahahah always think before you say

Nooooo Connor
pewdiepie: i beat the hardest boss on the first try <br><br>master mode moon lord: stop the cap
I wish that Felix could do a Minecraft and Terraria speedrun. Like if you want that to happen
i&#39;m unsubscribing cus after the stream u have to be member if u missed it
This game is so cool
Well, on normal everything is easy. I strongly recommend to play on expert mode. A lot of fun!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>PS. when you are masochist
Conner is levi now??
What class u felix <br>Felix :Whut ez class?
Everytime pewds die he just go to conner&#39;s room and starts to bully him
when he put the cursor on &#39;&#39;conner&#39;&#39; the guide&#39;s name was levi
I&#39;m surprised he thought wall of flesh was the hardest
God that title was cringe
When he beats the hardest boss - the ogs<br>Facepalm
moonlord is crying:(
ah yes, hardest boss
Where is Connor and WHO is Levi?
Terraria is a good game but it’s not better than minecraft
OK then kill the moon lord
So the dungeon guardian Wall of flesh it pains my very soul for you to say that what all flesh is if you&#39;re prepared easy if you&#39;re in hard mode he&#39;s easy if you&#39;re an end-game character he&#39;s a slime
Pewds: Let&#39;s find queen bee <b>Destroys honey</b> Skips*<br>Me: 0.0 THATS WHERE THE QUEEN BEE IS!
“Just crafted in the water “ bruh noice EngLiosh
uwu good idea.and the nurse is ula brita idk who sven or jeorgan is.
i like how he doesnt care about classes
“The hardest boss” is not wall of flesh. He just got bored of the series
“This is dynamite, it go boom boom”<br><b>*dies*</b>
no the hardest is actually the moonlord
“What’s an anglet?”<br>People who grew up with phineas and ferb:
