From the moment I first listened to this song, great vibe, but something always felt fishy with the lyrics.
El final de su foto en el plato es terrible , lo admiro para salir adelante , sabía hace tiempo , q la canción escondía algo oscuro pero no sabía que tanto era , hoy en día se saben muchas cosas

This is quite an amazing view of art.
2024 any one?
Me and Justin jaybay is what i call him at home have been together for a while now. I was the inspiration for yummy the song he wrote because of me. And we decided to keeep our relationship private because he wasnt ready to comeout the ckoset yet but i let him date that girl so he can hide the relationship between us. Some people say im delusional but i like to say im an opporunist
The coming to light. Can’t hide it behind clothes doors forever

El final donde sale justin de pequeño en un plato de comida… justo después de una tarta……pf, no sabemos todo lo que él sufrió
Listen to Justin Bieber&#39;s music Yummy in 2020, watch the video in 2024
Yummy food and love
Adrenochrome, child sacrifice, paedophilia...its no conspiracy evry1. Keep praying this gets exposed
What the message hey
4 Year ago I am 12 and now I am 16 but vibe📈
The pink napkin mouth wipes, the girls come out from under the table but JB is looking at a guy. I wonder who each of these characters are.
turbio
Here because of the whole p diddy and Epstein thing. <br><br>It’s sad a nice young man like this go sucked into the dark parts of Hollywood.
Who&#39;s here in 2024
Yummy
What happened to his chin at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=135">2:15</a>

The best song of the world
I love you Videos

YOU ARE A SURVIVOR ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Music ng mga Tambay na Adik
Here bc of FutureCanoe
Trying to watch this back and see the hidden messages !!
WEIRD video.  That creepy ending with his younger self on the plate with the word &#39;yummy&#39; under it?!  What the hell was that all about?  At two isolated points of the video, you can see the distortion of his mouth and chin and then his eyes.  It is totally out of place with the rest of the video.  Unless the implication is that the food and drink is laced with drugs, and our perception is warping due to hallucinations..?  That would explain the relentless spinning.  Something else I found a bit weird:  at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=27">0:27</a> we see a sandwich designed to look like a face with its tongue out.  There is a piece of bread leaning against it, concealing what appears to be a red cherry or cherry tomato from the other guests on the table.  At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=113">1:53</a> the sandwich is exposed and the red cherry has been replaced by a black olive.
On about 4 years ago?💀
god song be like i love justin biebers songs
Who is in 2024?
Never got the hate for this song when it came out. When you take into consideration the video and the lyrics and what we know about child stars now, i wouldnt be surprised if bieber has his own stories to tell. Hopefully he feels comfortable and safe enough to tell them at some point
I didn&#39;t see it at first. but this video is explaining all the people /peodos who&#39;ve abused him. look at how many people have been at the table with him....😢😮.... old people,women,young women,men, then at the end of the video. when the tables are cleared...he&#39;s still left ........ sad.... dread to think what goes on
XOXO
pizzagate?
Its March 2024, let&#39;s see how many legends are listening to this incredible song ❤
I really like this song Justin Bieber ❤ happy birthday 30
My favorite song
Justin Bieber has dark secrets
I like this songs from justin bieber and legendary❤😢
P DIDDY IS A LIZARD
Can’t believe the switched the video up so much
Who’s still watching this in 2024
This is my fav song when I was little
2024, still in rotation lol
Bro when it flashed to a plate with a picture of himself as a child with the word “yummy”… holy shit he basically just straight up said it
Anyone in 1st March 2024😭😭😭😭?
JB HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY IDOL BRO!!
El nombre Drew en el sweater me hace pensar q hace referencia a Drew Barrimore, q también desde niña fue víctima de toda esa gente, su baile en la mesa me recuerda a su coreografía de su canción baby, supongo lo ponían a bailar para ellos.
Listenin this song at the age of 29 now, understood the lyrics and all the evil done by the lobby. They are telling the story out loud. The people at JBs table are rich and old and they are here to molest the young ones included kids!
Justin Bieber the King 👑❤
Danny’s was better
Kinda crazy when it starts all the kids are performing for these old ass people and the look on there faces say it all. Its crazy its so hard to expose these sicks mfs because they are able to extort so easily with one allegation ect. Dam hes really been messed up by the industry its them not him
Love loyal fans💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Always happy and lucky🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀

I am one of the last people to understand the meaning of this song

❤ i love you Justin bieber❤❤❤❤
You know, I think imho being a survivor can mean different things to different ppl. As for myself for example, I believe being a survivor is simply coming out the other end of a predicament or situation, who&#39;s still breathing but not always as well as before, or as well as someone else could&#39;ve , or sometimes barely at all! Whether one comes out on top of a situation or just holding your head high enough to keep going, Is A Survivor.<br><br>J.B&#39;s innocence was taken, no doubt about it, and he was exposed to the darker side of &quot;surviving&quot; by those driven by money, greed, power and being #1 waaaay before his young heart &amp; mind would have.  He adapted. <br>He had to learn how to survive in his field at a young age, like many others just like him had to as well. <br>I imagine he was around things that would&#39;ve driven him insane every day, but to survive and to hold his ground and keep it together for his own sake, but (also for the public eyes on him at all times) for his label, his sponsors or whatever and whoever endorsed him and managed his income...<br>But he&#39;s not a kid anymore, and (to me it seems like) he knows what happened to him as he looks back on his life and sees that younger version of himself on the plate at the final shot of the video here... And he&#39;s doing what he can about it now, in spite of everything.<br>We can all see how he got eaten up, chewed up, and spit out by everyone! And he is still sending a message out thru one of the ways that he can, thru his voice - because he IS SURVIVING! <br>Like so many of us can relate even without the fame and the big bucks...<br>He is just a young man after all. 🩷
Iluminati oficial
We love Justin Bieber he’s the best and coolest singer he is one of the greatest!!!!!!!!!!
wtf was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=141">2:21</a> Lizardman😵‍💫
Funny how media thinks this is about his partner. No it’s not it’s about business deals and his sexual relationships with a male. His words I’m a lady, bona fide stallion meaning horse male !!! Come on read between the lines
This song related to the child sexually haresh ment and terrible
Who&#39;s here in 2024 👆
Any moosewala fan here --------&gt;
Much time has passed since this released, and Im just seeing this again in Feb 2024... Still love this video, and the song. Great collaboration between Justin &amp; Quavo, huge shout out to them and special love to the people in the community involved in this presentation... they are the true MVP&#39;s. Still loving this and them! ❤
This feels like something you&#39;d find playing in a terrible roblox experience in 2015
The song fire❤❤❤<br><br>But the food:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>❤❤❤❤❤❤. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

&quot;Standing up keep me on the rise&quot; = as long as I play along you (the Illuminati) keep me on the rise and my success going &quot;lost control of myself I&#39;m compromised&quot; = Illuminati controlling Bieber&#39;s life and forced him to compromise himself &quot;you&#39;re incriminating no disguise&quot; =Illuminati incriminating people and don&#39;t even try to hide it, it&#39;s out in the open &quot;and you ain&#39;t never running low on supplies&quot; their &quot;supply&quot; of children is constant. These lyrics are SO OBVIOUS. How are people still not understanding.. We&#39;re reaching. Ok
Who is the guy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=116">1:56</a> ?
Food does makes us happy 😂
Pretty sure that old dude next to him is supposed to be Podesta...just saying.
Yummy ya ❤respect this now❤
At the beginning of the video Justin just has a little sandwich, positioned so the bread is shielding a nice red cherry from the other ppl at the table so that only he can see it.<br><br>Once the nasty food starts coming in, the sandwich gets turned around and exposed, and you can see clearly at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=108">1:48</a> that the Cherry has turned pitch black.

Wow I Get Goosebumps On Justin Bieber

When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - In The Sky” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💝

2024, somebody?
2024 Anyone ?
It has been 4 years I haven’t heard this song
This  music  is❤ILOVE  YOU
mariana is badussy
I good singing you number one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=87">1:27</a> ... it&#39; s to show how the old manager can watch what Justin watch , as showed in the movie Obey and a chapter of Black Mirror and a french movie called Bethy Blue too. They are able to use this kind of technology since 1982 at least.
The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - In The Sky” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕🎉
Ye babe in the morning dhhdhd
🍕
I love you so much ❤
Man I haven’t listened to this song from 2020 it was 4 years ago so nostalgic 😭
Who cam after jumpers jump😂 podcast 😂😂😂
I love this song<br>How can people hate it
Not even 2seconds In . And I see Restaurant hidden behind a restaurant 😢for kids to get abused or whatever so sad and symbolic
2024 Anyone???
Nkfkkfkf
Hoka
Look at his chin
I really don&#39;t understand why people hate this song so much. It doesn&#39;t sound that different from any other pop song, and they don&#39;t scrutinize and criticize those songs even half as much. It&#39;s a fun song, I like it.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤amazing
Solamente justin sabe lo que paso realmente y se necesita mucha fortaleza mental para superar todos los obstáculos.
Who is 2024 her ????
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=140">2:20</a> look at his jaw

Justin eu gosto muito de você e eu estou escutando essa música pelo tablet do meu pai
yammy it is cod

En esa canción manda un mensaje subliminal 💔 . El Saco está súper maltratado . Roto por todos lados

JUSTIN YOU HAVE COOL MUSIC 🤩💜
I love you justin
Aaaaaahh why Justin is saying my bestie name😝
This inspired me to
This is the first time I&#39;ve seen this music video...i assumed by the lyrics it would be hypersexual and butts everywhere  ..but after i heard the theory of exposing child SA in the industry 😳 (talking about the baby  promo images on his insta) and the glutinous nature of the video, and then final clip is him as a child on the plate ...idk😬
Me be like in restorane😂
Yummy
oke
nice
Who listenin this 2024¿¿¿???😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love bts
i love justin
his artistry in showing greed and how hollywood can never get enough is extremely powerful.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=140">2:20</a> bro got that supreme chin
Anyone in 2024?
2024???😅
왜앗을일인까요?😮
야미무슨뜻인가요
it&#39;s the way i&#39;m just now getting what this music video actually meant...so sad
What’s the issue with this? He’s enjoying food &amp; talking about his wife
I wonder if Bruce Falconer has heard this song … sounds very similar to Gohan’s Anger
Jefrey epstein😮
I love this song its so hyped and it the one and only justin bieber
2024 anyone?
You taste so much, eat me and my heart will say yummy yummy 😋
Who listening to this in 2024?😅
Never thought id say this, but is JB one of the real ones?🤔
We are so sorry justin
justin has done shitty things but he’s literally been through the wringer omg. not only did he get exploited, possibly SAed, and taken advantage of from people in hollywood but he was also massively bullied online and in person when he was younger and all of it was happening at the same time. usually i never feel bad for rich people but i feel so bad for him :(
i’m so sorry justin :(
soy el único que vino por Habbo?
💗
Meus Deus! Me lembro como se fosse ontem que esse clipe foi lançado em 2020,  e hoje já se passou 4 anos!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=173">2:53</a> that’s definitely Jeffrey Epstein
Nope after all the p diddy shit going down 😢

Ayam ayam ayam
Very sad 😢 JB survivor
Very cool❤❤❤😊
All these child stars growing up to be “crazy” or disturbed” have seen the darkest of places of evil. My heart goes out to them all may they heal from what the industry has done to them.
I&#39;m 18 and started making music when I was 12 I hope to get there someday. Justin Bieber success story inspires my art. It was never easy.
I get it! Came here from the pizzagate comment! Wow!
🐐
Veo personas mayores como empresarios y veo la comida como gelatina  y veo niños. Pareciera que gente influyente explotará a niños y comen carne de humanos
Muy raro la cancion
You are crazy you hate your Fans I’m exposing you I’m
Could the clip then be a reference to certain billionaires who are involved in child trafficking?  It&#39;s explained why there are only children performing in the show, they don&#39;t seem happy.  Justin is very brave, many celebrities who want to unmask these groups are also.  The music is good, but I&#39;ll never listen to it the same way I did before!🤷💀

Where the f is lyrics
I still remember this song. It was like a comeback. I remember when he sang it, he was suffering from problems in his life. I was sad at the time and happy at the same time. Happy because he released a new album that blew up the world, and sad because he was suffering alone from problems and I could not be with him. I hope you are well.  Justin, I am glad you are well. You deserve all the best
bro that music star has banned on conzert and he 100% cringe☠☠☠☠🤣🤣👌👌
When I was younger, I used to listen to it for hours

😢
WHO TF STRETCHED JUSTINS JAW LIKE TF
Hellwood  is eating young souls  , promising them fame&amp; money ..     😢 he feels empty &amp; lost after being used.  His marriage is a part of this all , a fake lifestyle.  He lost his real love &amp; nothing can compensate it ever, not a model, neither a church....

Who here 2024?
2024 ❤
¡ Vamos ahora, ricos! Llorad y aullad por las miserias que os vendrán. Vuestras riquezas están podridas, y Vuestras ropas están comidas de polilla. Vuestro oro y plata están enmohecidos; y su moho testificara contra vos otros, y devorara del todo... (santiago 1: 1-4) no nos preocupemos la sentencia viene.
What is this song of Justin Bieber?❤👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
2024, anyone??
If you know you know.
If you know, you know. Soon they will face the full force of the American Taxpayer.
his isn&#39;t just music; it&#39;s an emotion. It&#39;s that perfect soundtrack for both the highs and lows of life. Pure brilliance
Bro what is with the Pink hair<br><br>Ha Ha Ha<br><br>Love this song!<br><br>Bro everything in moderation buddy<br><br>I get it<br><br>Your wife is<br><br>Breakfast lunch dinner<br><br>Ha Ha Ha<br><br>Moderation bro<br><br>Ha Ha Ha
Those who know can&#39;t sleep. This stuff is terrifying.
Alguém aqui é do brasil, deixa seu ❤
I love it so much
Thumbnail has changed, what could be the reason ?
Avicii exposed the pedo rings too with For A Better Day.. and he “died”. Praying for Justin, may he be protected. We truly love you Justin and you’re not alone, we stand with you, and we support you for speaking up. Sending you all the love in my heart. Thank you for doing this when no other “powerful” celebrity out there dares to speak up about. ❤🙏🏼
This is song listen on 2024 guys
So sad 😢😢😢praying for all the victims of sex traffic.
A la gente que dice que fue un niño explotado por la Industria.<br>No, se le dió un elección y el eligió y pagó sus consecuencias.<br>Pudo haber dicho que no al dinero y a la fama, que no compran la felicidad como pueden ver ahora.
2m21 what a face .
I’m so surprised I haven’t seen anyone else sing the song
Tbm gosto demais dessa a vibe dela tbm sem comentários perfeita .❤
I came here to see if Justin&#39;s chin actually becomes discombobulated like in FutureCanoe&#39;s videos when he reacts to good food he makes
EX COELIS DILEAS GU BRATH ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tim Biebs are YUMMMY
Who came here after hearing the yummy😢 theory  from tiktok. I heard it for @Khalil |Storyteller🫠🙃
As a Canadian from Vancouver, feel my fav singer can&#39;t do have a feel good anywhere.<br>I love all of his songs but this one&#39;s special! I&#39;ve loved it ever since I for the first time 2yrs listened this song. This song about it what he was going through as a child growing up. I&#39;m sorry this is dirty story but the song was deep touch to me and still I love it song. Thanks Justin.
I came here after the yummy theory and ellen show, now it makes sense about those gross food and a baby pic of himself
Las personas que salen ahí, con sus ropa extravagante y lujosa no son más que famosos , políticos, científicos , personas de alto poder que pactican la p3d0f1l1a y el abuso que salen en la Lista de Eipten , no es una historia conspirativa, es la realidad, por eso el vídeo se ve raro , la gente comiendo , lo peor es que como son gente de alto poder que se hace, NADA, siguen trabajando como si NADA , no pagan contra la ley
This video is creepy asf. Looks like all the elites around a table and he&#39;s the one being preyed upon. Everyone around thd table is older than he is and he&#39;s the only one who is in pink which symbolize him as being fertile or female.
I like song yummy so such
Tengo una teoría<br>Que esto esta vinculado con una red de niños ya que se muestra personas con dinero en un lugar lujoso comiendo primero y al final parece en el plato un niño pequeño...<br>No se pero el lugar me recuerda a la casa blanca 😭😭
Gözlerim doldu. Her şey şimdi çok anlamlı. İyi ki varsın justin❤️
I love you justin
My walk up song
This is just so sad. . I never saw the video before or really listened to the lyrics. . Very sad. . Hope you are in a good place now 🎶🌻✨
Sinto muito Justin, esse clipe revela o lado n0jent0 da elite, dos poderosos! As crianças em volta fo clipe, TUDO faz sentido agora
I love you Justin
This is so sad
Yummy😢
This song is not about the food…
He does look uncomfortable but that’s just how I feel and something is off about this music video if you guys can’t tell
Who don&#39;t like yummy food?😅
What is the meaning of this song
Why pop star music videos can&#39;t be simple and normal?<br>I fed up with all disturbing images and undercover messages...
2024年は、誰だ??🌍
Isso faz muito sentido agr, no final escrito yummy no prato com a foto dele criança! Meu Deus, como não vi isso antes… e está lembrando tb quando ele era pequeno e foi cantar para Obama, lembram?
No pizza anymore
people on tiktok call this song lazy not at all😭
lol who seen that woman in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=148">2:28</a> with a blood like stain on her lips
i knew it just wouldn&#39;t make no sense that bieber&#39;s first single in 5 good years would be &quot;yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy&quot;, i just wish we understood the messages earlier
you know what the craziest part about this video is??? in the BTS, he was found on the floor crying, literally balling his eyes out. <br><br>the media really tried to portray him as the evil one lol.. the way he disappeared from hollywood for 4 years, came back as a christian and settled down tells you everything you need to know. <br><br>it&#39;s obvious he wants nothing to do with the fame anymore.
him entering the room at the beginning shows him as an innocent young man and then he sits in the midst of the elites who deceived him, used and abused him. <br><br>this is the story of 15 year old justin 13 years ago.. it&#39;s sad that no one was there to protect him, not even his mother. <br>his father only came back into his life when he started making money

justin bieber, 1 of the greatest singers of all times, may God bless him and protect him,<br><br>1 of the things am proud about, is that even though i am a male, but i never hated him since the baby song, while all other males my age, hated him, am glad i didn&#39;t make that mistake, plus, he&#39;s a pisces like me, but i am a february pisces, while he&#39;s a march pisces, that&#39;s the difference,

If you could just Think and Avoid the word Pink. This track would be 💯
Lastima que Fue uno mas qué sufrio abusos, a cambio de dinero y fama. Ahora miren ? Famoso, y todo, &quot;dinero&quot; si es que se puede decir, pero al final tal vez con miles de problemas personales por dentro. Tengo todo &quot;material&quot; pero y mi esencia mi niñez la perdi, y todo es 50/50, al final no TIENE NADA! Lástima 😢

Now I understand the clip..😢
Hay que estar ciegos para no darnos cuenta toda lo que nos da entender en este video🥹 pobre Justin
El video arranca con 3 violines, sublime
Şimdi klibi daha iyi anlıyorum. Justin bize herşeyi anlatmış aslında
ඔව් ඔබ ඒක ගත්තා...රසායි රසායි😂🥹
Song is about rich wealthy people using children for entertainment and gratification!!!<br>All the older people in the videos were eating foods that were for children!!!<br>And ADRENOCHROME!!!
Joya
Quem reparou que tinha uma mulher vestida de vermelho em uma cadeira atrás do Justin e dps no final a roupa dela estava na cadeira?

Ahora todo tiene sentido 😢
He’s been trying to tell us 😢 this is so sad. No wonder this kid was troubled.
Zamanında Justin Bieber ifşa etti epstein meselesini ama kimse dikkate almadı
Denuncia a essa industria criminosa!
Nadie presto atencion a lo mínimo
Ulımınate 👉 Justin Bieber ❤
He’s been trying to tell everyone!
Is that rly Justin beaver boy
La teoría ahora tiene sentido… que turbio…
Justin… 🥺
This song is a call out on P Diddy. Since he groomed justin. Sick man.
Justin que te hicieron? Hablá por Dios! Ya no es necesario que escondas mensajes en canciones! La información viaja rapidísimo a través de las redes. Por favor 🙏 hablá! Todo esto es tan sucio e injusto, no soporto ver a un chico que nació para dar su luz a mucha gente esté triste por culpa de perversos de malditos psicópatas! <br>Es muy importante que hagas arte, que inspires y escribas música, tenés el talento, tenés la luz..no hagas más giras! Usa sus herramientas a tu favor! Escribí la música que te salga del corazón
Justin ♥
Siz şarkıyla dalga geçmeye devam edin adam p*dofiliye dikkat çekmek için böyle şarkı ve klip yaptı izlerken mahvoluyorum 😢 kim bilir nelere şahit oldu
Pra quem não esta entendendo, o Justin testemunhou uma vez as lamentáveis cenas do caso Epstein e vários famosos como Lady Gaga, Oprah, Hillary Clinton praticando sexo com pessoas traficadas e ped0fili4, Jeffrey ofereceu uma carreira homérica e ainda maior a Justin Bieber, featuring com as lendas de Hollywood como Jay-Z pra isso ele teria que no ritual de iniciação aceitar abusar de uma criança que foi apresentada a ele completamente drogada pra ele abusar e depois sacrificar, ele ficou mega horrorizado, traumatizado e rejeitou tudo aquilo.. como forma de expressão e de jogar aquilo pra fora pois estava consumindo a mente dele, ele fez esse clipe como forma de denuncia e pra por pra fora esse pesadelo nojento que ele presenciou nos bastidores de Hollywood.
This is the worst shite I&#39;ve ever  seen or heard. Is this what passes for music now? Mind boggling!
The thumbnail 👀
En el momento <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=139">2:19</a> vemos como la cara de Justin Bieber se deforma y lo cual da un grande parecido a Epstein 😮
Is this really about eating kids ?
I love my brother ❤ 4ever

Isla 🏝️
MEU DEUS! Quando eu assisti esse clipe pela primeira vez, não tinha entendido absolutamente nada dele. Sempre achei estranho. Mas agora em 2024, depois desse escândalo do Epstein ter sido exposto, voltei aqui para assistir novamente e fiquei chocado. Principalmente com a cena final. Agora sim tudo faz sentido pra mim. Que horror! 😭 Pobre Justin, a sua justiça vai chegar e esses canalhas vão pagar, um por um.
The last part of the video is scary :s
Quando lançou eu imaginava ser apenas uma música quente dedicada a sua esposa. <br>Hoje, depois de saber sobre os casos de p3d0 e do abuso que Justin sofreu, esse clipe me causa uma sensação nada agradável. <br>Porém, muito bem feito. Protejam nossas crianças
😢 la elite hace muchas cosas que nosotros no sabemos
Analisem o vídeo com muita atenção, ele tem muitas referências a Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Oprah e até Lady Gaga.
La cara a largada al <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=79">1:19</a> aque se deberá ?
SABEMOS QUE ESTA CANCIÓN ESTA SUBIDA HACE 4 AÑOS POR ESO YA NO PEGA CANCIONES DESDE HACE 4 AÑOS 😮😮
damn i dismissed this when i was younger but now i understand to some degree and it’s so sad
the way they distort his face randomly is so fucking creepy
This video brings me chills...I hope that every dark secret gets exposed
This song sounds like it&#39;s a party in my yummy!
Te amo Justin🥺❤️
A foto dele criança no prato entregou tudo
I am here after Meatcanyon, it&#39;s hilarious
Adults are so disgusting. I went down the yummy rabbit hole and now I’m here. Just sad.
💔😭 Holy shit, I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that man.
lost control of myself, i&#39;m compromised<br>youre incriminated- no disguise and you ain&#39;t ever running low on supplies
Beautiful boy 😘
Here because of tik tok
Vengo de tik tok...
Esa foto al final le dió sentido a toda la letra 🥺
even in 2024 you still hear it
I’m sorry this happened to you 💔
Quería  ser escuchado y muchia lo ignoramos. Ahora sabemos.el.verdadero significado de la cancion
The way he dances 😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 got me on the ground 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=171">2:51</a> era una referencia a Jefry Epstein?, lo digo por el parecido.
Real life Finnick Odair
Muy fuerte lo qe hay detras de esta musica.
Ha sido el único de la industria que lo a hecho,gran valor.<br>El video impactante.
Why is he in all pink though? Pink napkins even his hair… what’s the meaning?
1. Lo invitaron a ese lugar de reunión <br>2. En su inocencia pensó que no pasaría nada,pero se percató que el ambiente estaba raro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=231">3:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=231">3:51</a>
This music video… makes absolutely no sense whatsoever
Yo ponia esa canción en mis historias cuando comia algo delicioso.😮😢
I can&#39;t believe this clown is still around.
justin bieber supremacy &gt;&gt;&gt;
This is fkd
Checaron que al final del vídeo cuando apagan las luces se queda solo con un hombre😢😢 alguien me puede decir quién es ese hombre ?
Ariana grande nunca haría lo que hicieron esos infelices
🥺todo lo que tuvo que pasar Justin 🤬el es muy fuerte
I’m sad about the meaning and truth behind 😢
Polémica 2024
Agora esse videoclipe faz TODO sentido, na época não entendi o episódio traumático que Justin tinha passado nos bastidores da indústria de Hollywood.
Quem mais veio pra ver a mensagem que Justin deixou nas entrelinhas denunciando o lado podre de Epstein e dos donos de Hollywood nesse clipe? 🖐️ Justin foi grandão ai!
Free palestine
Danny gonzales’s yummy was better
¿Quién más está aquí por el caso de Epstein?
Quien mas vino x la isla de eipstein 😂?
viendo mas a detalle el video!.. los chicos que salen con el  se parecen mucho a Demi lovato,Taylor,selena,etc
Justin dio las señales y nadie lo entendió
Indirecta.... a jeffrey e_pst_ein....
Bem que lá por 2020 disseram sobre a teoria desse vídeo, agora que eu compreendi
justin dijo que esa musica era para su esposa hailey, no se que creer😢

CAN THIS COMMENT GET 1K LIKES??? probs not
Diddy is the domino
Smfh so sad. You idiots are like oh this is a great song! So good! It’s literally him showing how them old ass holly wood people abused him and used him for sex and to get paid. The only person in the room at the end was an old man with him!!!!
😳🥺
Who is here in 2024
Anyone 2024?
Todo lo que habra sufrido 😢
Respeto &lt;3 gracias Justin por tu valentía
Al inicio una de las niñas lleva una prenda rosa brillante y al final del video se mira la prenda colgada en una de las estatuas,tiene tantos mensajes este video que es triste
No entendimos la denuncia de este video nosotros no pero la industria si y lo sacaron del juego 😢😢😢
People are woken to the nasty shit those wealthy elites do
Nossa os comentários dos brasileiros 🤦‍♀️ sinceramente não entendem nada de interpretação visual! Da até vergonha alheia… pesquisem<br>Mais galera!

Shoutout to JB for warning us with this cryptic video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=170">2:50</a> efftein. Justin sabe cosas que las elites trataran que no salgan mas cosas a la luz.
Después de 4 años todo tiene un sentido real en este video.
Can&#39;t Believe This Song is Already 4 years old Man time going Fast
depois de descobri pq o justin gravou isso fico assim💀💀💀💀
NO BRO EN ESA ISLA LO DETONARON.😮😢
2024?

Estudien muy bien el video hace mucha referencia a Bill Clinton,Hillary Clinton,Oprah y hasta lady gaga
2024 anyone
bro..
Nobody heard you Justin but karma exist and no ones can lie forever, all the truth is coming out. <br>You are a survivor from there.
Me sorprende la cantidad de personas que a menos que algo se haga publico crean en los mensajes que varios artistas han dejado con el paso del tiempo. Bien dicen que podemos tener la verdad ante nuestros ojos  y aún así no querer verla.

Pizza Gate 😢🥺
👁️
If only this video has a better music to support its message
Estuve analizando y la mansión donde están, se parece a la mansión que compro Jeffrey Einstein en Palm Beach...full referencia xd
Todo tiene sentido y no me di cuenta
El video entero es una obra maestra que te habla del tráfico y consumo de infantes por parte de la red perversa de pedofilia wue se mueve en estados unidos, Justin fue sumamente valiente, siempre supe el transfondo de lo que quiso gritarle al mundo, me contenta saber que mas gente está abriendo los ojos, el mensaje final es, ¡cuiden a los niños!
Talking about sum exposing when he’s literally participating and knowing what’s going and if u don’t know his video shows pedophilia of lil boys and girls with the symbolism of pizza
Poor justin
What is yummy? Pizza? OMG!!!!
Que significa yumy yum
so is everyone suddenly realizing this video was about the whole epstein thing? you guys are so slow
La verdad que esta canción y vídeo musical tiene demasiado sentido ahora para mi, antes no la entendía. Pero ahora todo está más que claro!
Al final sale un señor comiéndose un pastel y es el mismo pastel dónde sale la foto de justin
Alguien mas se dio cuenta de que el entra y se sienta en la mesa y se empiezan a acercar las personas a sentarse con el 🤔
You&#39;re a very strong man Justin Bieber 🥰💯 I&#39;m sorry what you had to go through 😢you were so young God will fight your battle for you If you let Him.
2024🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alguien se dió cuenta que cambiaron la portada de este video como referencia a Oprah del caso Jeffry Epstein? ... Justin lo supo todo este tiempo<br><br>Did anyone notice that they changed the cover of the video as a reference to Oprah about the Jeffry Epstein case? ...Justin knew this all along
mano, simplesmente toda vez q eu me aprofundo no contexto dessas musicas que parecem ser inocentes, sempre tem um contexto sombrio por trás, pqp
Justin gracias por denunciar tanta mierda en este siglo!💗 Justin Free🙏
Agora fiquei com dó do Justin por conta dessa indústria maldita.
This is gonna be a protests Justin against child abuse he stage the Epstein&#39;s party in that video he knew but he can&#39;t speak because they can eliminate him that way they did with MJ
En la teoria del pelo hay una teoria que si te pintas el pelo de rosa es que has sido abusado
Siento tanto que hayas pasado por esto justin, ojala ya hayas podido salir del control de esos asquerosos.
The autotune just got ridiculous
He knows
Ahora todo tiene sentido 😮
One of the best songs of Justin Bieber , everything the melody the lyrics the whole video , and the meaning behind.
2024someone?😎🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=129">2:09</a> OPRAH
Justin sabía cosas y nadie lo escucho ahora de qué salió el tema de la isla todo tiene sentido
JAJAJAJAJA, cada que el tema de pedofilia se vuelve tendencia vienen a deducir cosas y que &quot;abrieron los ojos&quot; pero al mes ya todos olvidaron el tema.<br>Paso en 2020 con pizzagate.<br>Me parece paso en 2022 con Anonymous.<br>Y ahora en 2024 con la lista de Epstein.<br><br>Siempre pasa lo mismo y nadie hace nada.

Después de ver tantas teorias sobre esta canción, ya no la puedo ver de la misma manera
💀💀💀💀
SIEMPRE TUVO RAZON
Broo💀
Now I&#39;m realising what things he was exclaimedyummy for
i always knew this videos deeper meaning but i’m glad more people are understanding it
Fue un niño explotado por la industria y todavía tuvo el odio injustificado por la sociedad muchísimos años! Justin es una persona muy fuerte. ❤
So basically...he performed for a group of old people everyone knew what was up and when he was done they ate his innocence...who came here after that one tiktok?
Nomas se sienta y lo rodean puros adultos y viejos😢
Estoy aquí por lo que esta pasando en el mundo sobre la isla y la trata de infantes 💔😔
justin is to be respected and admired tbh. ❤️
Hello
como veo este video sin sentirme triste por cada niño que ha vivido eso😢
Who are here for the yummy island 😂
Incluso al final en el piso parece como si quisiera representar la medalla/ collar que dió Obama...

Funny how no one noticed the Jeffery Epstein look alike @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=174">2:54</a>
Recuerdo a ver visto esta canción años atras, cuando estaba todo el revuelo de epstein.<br>muchos salieron a decir que esta canción era una más de justin y que no tenia ninguna relación, pero hombre... no hay que ser tan observador como para ver que el video no tiene sentido, esta bien hecho y quiere mostarar lo que ya todos sabemos, y fue hasta hace dias que ya gran parte de esa gente que no creyo, ahora lo hace. Hace que este video sea un mas perturbador e increible.<br>y segun muchos dijeron que justin comentoque el video no tiene relevancia con epstein, pero obvio no iba a salir a decir que lo tenía
if you think this song and music video is a critique on hollywood pedophilia you have schizophrenia<br><br>also while we’re at it trying to theorise about someone’s potential sexual assault is fucking lunacy
De pensar que toda esa comida e para niños y puros viejos o señores lo comen
Te amo justin ❤😢
Pobres niños almas inocentes en el mundo 😢
I feel like if he truly wanted to expose, he’d be serving pizza and hotdogs… not jello n lobster haha
Vengo despues de 4 años que la escucho y porfin entiendo el video mucha referencia a esa isla😮
The ending being a pic of his younger self on a plate? Chilling
🏝
Omg 2024❤️🔥❤️
Who’s here after the tik tok
Creepy, hope he heals 🙏🏼
Después de ver lo de la isla de Epstein.... Ahora este video toma sentido
Can&#39;t believe Changes album released 4 years ago 😢feels like yesterday ❤
Siempre supe que esta cancion tenia algo oculto
Who’s here after seeing Katlyn’s tiktok?
Old people…young kids? Free Palestine
The old people are so creepy
Fuckin Cannibals
I wish I could protect him
who is here after the epstein list
so basically Justin has been on the menu since he came onto the scene as a child, and anyone who could afford it got a taste. All while lining his pockets handsomely to watch him entertain them into oblivion. Makes sense why he and many others dove deep into substance abuse and whatnot for years. Not excusing anything, just noticing. i also noticed the only person left /dining/ at the end was an assumedly j-ewish older male....
Cuando se sube a la mesa interpreto su coreografía como si diera señales con las manos , también me pareció que dió el giro muy conocido de Michael Jackson como apollo a el a parte de que Justin se inspira en el y siempre fue su fans .
He looks so angry in this video
Exposed in 2024!!!<br>Protect our children.
Claramente veo ahí a oprha 😱
Omg esta más que claro el mensaje 😢
How many children and women have been traumatized or d*ad because of a person/men needing to get that bust.
Ah, ahora sí se confirma, yo ya entender
I think all the theories and messages got undermined because ppl were too busy hating on this. It’s a catchy tune and he was smart for a sec
ISLA
ahora de ver lo de la lista este video tiene mucho sentido 💀
Justin is a Survivor, i admire and respect him so much, as a person, the great entertainer that he is and for raise his voice about all the industry did to him as a kid, King JB FOREVER ❤❤❤
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pizzagate">#Pizzagate</a>, todos tienen que caer
My god this video makes my core rattle. I hope 2024 is the year everything is finally exposed
🥺 aww Justin we didn’t know
Who’s here after Katt Williams interview talking about p diddy😳
Ahora todo tiene sentido 😢
esta canción esconde muchas cosas escondidas
ahora entendi todo esto gracias justin biber el desgrasiado caso de esas listas y de famosos tonto pudiendo saber todo lo que an hecho todo esta en twiter
ahora tiene sentido
F
You dont need to be in the elite when the same thing happens to you in your own family enviroment. They in every where.....
Referencias de las god
Well well well
Este video ya se sabía de que hablaba es que somos ciegos hasta que el control te dice que es verdad. Despierta
🙌 gente, no es loco q justo la fecha de la filtración de los nombres en la lista de Epstein acá en la redes, es la misma q el día q se subió este video allá a principios del 2020? 😯😲😶
Es impresionante que después de 4 años no lo hayan desaparecido y espero no lo hagan 😢
💀
Es totalmente claro el mensaje de Justin Bieber, la exhibición de toda la Pedofilia en la Industria de la Música; Sin duda me queda claro que los que se sientan con El en la mesa hace referencia a Jhon Podesta ex coordinador de campaña presidencial en 2016 de Hillary Clinton donde además aparece una mujer que hace referencia a ella.
Wn como que 4 años 😭
Y el de Rosalía  el vídeo
Hay una señora afrodescendiente, un señor de cabello blanco en terno ...<br>Mmmmm muy sospechoso
Ahora todo toma sentido.
Oh my God this song started to scare💔!!
Bien a escucharla por el caso de la isla 😮😮.

Ahora todo tiene sentido😢
:
J&#39;ai compris maintenant 😮😮
It&#39;s weird how when you listen to the song, you think it&#39;s a sexual song towards your partner. But why is there all old people in the music video.
😂 yo vengo por tiktok ahora todo cobra sentido
AHORA ESTO TOMA SENTIDO
TU SABÍAS MUCHAS COSAS JUSTIN!
Jefrey jefrey &quot; XD
Tu y yo sabemos perfectamente porque estás aquí 👀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=13">0:13</a> Justin llega, se ve a niños tocando, pueda dar referencia a qué están a su merced.<br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=20">0:20</a> cuando Justin se sienta todos los que lo rodean le miran y se acerca, algunos de los que alcance a reconocer el Jhon Podesta.<br>Los que están en la mesa con justin le ofrecen comida , luego en los minutos - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=138">2:18</a> y <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=141">2:21</a> aparece con los ojos deformados e igual la quijada, dando a entender que a sido drogado.<br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=109">1:49</a> &quot; perdí el control de mi mismo, estoy en peligro &quot; claramente referencia a qué está siendo controlado y manipulado y probablemente amenazado.<br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=100">1:40</a> estás incrimado sin disfraz, es decir que abusan de los niños siendo ellos mismos mejor mostrándose ellos sin ninguna mascara.<br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=121">2:01</a> esta parte también es importante, el chico se ve tranquilo y aburrido, pero comiendo.<br><br><br>Luego de unos minutos se empieza a mover también dando a entender que vaba sido drogado.<br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=130">2:10</a> que asco solo imaginense que lo que comen son niños que han sido ofrecidos para ellos.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=200">3:20</a> todos drogados<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=220">3:40</a> Es claro, Justin se queda solo con &quot; Jhon Podesta y su ex manager &quot; puede ser que ellos fueron los que lo violaron, ya que el ex manager fue acusado de abuso sexual mucho antes estaba aleg mucho a Justin diciendo que<br>&quot; era hermoso como solo una mujer podía serlo&quot; que horror<br>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=225">3:45</a> la última del pastel, clarísimo que fue el postre de estos imbéciles
:(
&quot;Las mentiras nunca duran por siempre, esa es la verdad&quot;
Justice for Avicci, Paul Walker, Chester Bennington, ChrisCornell, Anne Heche and Kurt Cobain for exposing the pedophiles
Qui est venu comme moi regarder le clip pour le complot pizza....
😢 now we know
4 ans
vine por el xokas
En ese vídeo salen la mayoría de los que fueron a la ISLA de Epstein.. dan ascoo! JHON PODESTA ES EL PRIMERO
Pizza gate
Vuelvo aquí cada que se revela una verdad de la industria
Ahora si  están escuchando ehhh 😅😮
todo tiene sentido
Un visionario
Vengo despues que se ha &quot;liberado&quot; la lista de los visitantes a la Little Island Saint Jane de Jeffrey Epstein. Si algo le pasa a Justin Bieber, es as3s1n4t0, no su1c1d10.
La lista de Epstein
Came here after tik tok theories - so sad
Referencias de la lista Epstein por todos lados
Perdoname por todo Justin Bieber
Also... when your sandwich was facing you it was a cute little red cherry 🍒, why once your sandwich was turned around its black af?? What you telling me Justin 🥺👂🏽
Desde que vi este video, cambió mi forma de ver a Justin, de un niño cualquiera de la industria, a un hombre que alzó la voz...
Anyone in 2024?
Oh Justin🥺. Why was your baby picture on the plate ? Makes me wonder
Luego de ver todos los cometarios, veo que Bieber se habra decepcionado de que mas de un fan no entendiera el mensaje oculto, eso me hace ver superior a todos ellos 😂, y eso que yo lo det3staba, pero esta cancion fue su redencion y ahora para mi es un heroe, esto significa que la industria artisitica tiene muy bien controlada a las masas
Justin, discúlpanos por no tomarlo en serio .
La elite es muy poderosa <br>Los iluminatis abusan de los niños sirviendo comidas a los adulto que salen ahí en el video muy raro
Pizza 😢
Idk why but I used to sing this before it got realised by a year or so and i didn’t even know this song was there
Ahora todo tiene sentido 💀 que asco de mundo la verdad
😢 pobre Justin
Vine a ver si de verdad cambiaron la miniatura , increíble lo que está pasando, ojalá los americanos no se queden sin hacer nada

Alguien 2024 después de que saliera la lista de Jeffrey  Epstein
el cambio de la miniatura... será una referencia a los nombres de conocidos dados recientemente en la lista de Jeffrey Epstein? 🤔
😮
Un grande Justin
Cambiaron la miniatura
😳😳😳😳😳😳
Justin Bieber was trying to warn us about child trafficking and Epstein!<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23soundoffreedom">#SoundofFreedom</a>
is the new frame looking like Oprah?
After Epstein list, make sense 😢
Jeffrey Epstein hause
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pizzagate">#pizzagate</a>
:(
Notice how at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=160">2:40</a> all the young female dancers are wearing white? The colour white is known to be symbolic of innocence, purity, cleanliness. Them dancing with the other regular male party goers who are wearing colourful clothing is representative of how rich, powerful and high-profile men would take the innocence of these high-profile young women. Justin just sits there and sings as this goes on, this is representative of how he and other people KNOW whats going on, but nothing can be done to stop it. After, Justin takes his hoodie off and starts dancing with them, showing how he is included in this but at the end he is left all alone, the place is deserted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=213">3:33</a> . His body language is defensive (crossing his arms) and we see a young picture of him on a plate. He is showing how he feels (uncomfortable) and this hints to him possibly being abused and other children.<br><br>I wrote this quickly so I&#39;m sorry if some things are not very clear or i missed some details, as I really wanted to get this out.<br>Other things i noticed<br>- Pink napkins are significant in this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=70">1:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=81">1:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=91">1:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=143">2:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=150">2:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=157">2:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=164">2:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=215">3:35</a><br>- His eyebrows and then jaw become distorted and un-human like at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=138">2:18</a><br>- The lighting goes dark blue when they start dancing around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=160">2:40</a>
After the famous events, I looked at this clip differently
Justin, I’m sorry for what that twisted industry did to you
Quién de 2024 después de ver la lista¿?😭😢
Cada vez esta canción toma mas sentido hacia la pedofilia tiene un mensaje oculto
Y ahora con la lista de la isla del terror de Jeffrey Epstein podemos ver qué Justin siempre quiso advertirlo
I can’t believe I’ve never watched this video before. Weird. Song is weird
Quien vino por lo de la isla??
En twitter dicen que cambiaron la miniatura a una mujer parecida a Oprah ahora que salió la lista de Epstein👀
This is sick
Justin nos avisaste desde hace mucho de pizagatee de la isla de jefrein epstein
Uy! Ahorita con la lista que salió vaya que les queda esa canción...😮
the end 💀
The band being children performing for these old people. And the plate at the end with a picture of himself when he was little is just saying it all. It’s a disgusting world we live in that’s for sure.
Uff que fuerte, aquí se explica lo de esa isla asquerosa con esos pedófilos
Watching this, with all the drama going now rn (iykyk) just makes me sick somehow...
Epstein?
Sentí que nuestro chico quiso decir muchas cosas con este video, da escalofríos ver la porción de torta al final desapareciendo, y queda la imagen de Justin siendo niño 😢 y el color rosa en su outfit 😟 No sé si estoy últimamente muy delulu con lo que está pasando precisamente hoy 😬
Who are here for the Oprah miniature 🤭
Who came here after the TikTok
Vengo por la miniatura de oprah
This is my first time seeing and hearing this song but I think that the video should have been more of a sexy vibe than about him sitting at a restaurant with some strangers. Sure it shows food but this song is far from what it is really talking about. My thing is a video should match with the song. Other than that the song is fire.
la LIsta la Lista!!!!
Aquí estoy de nuevo después de la lista del Jeffrey epstein. Grande Justin Bieber y Michael Jackson que se atrevieron a exponer esto.
Después de la lista de Jeffry Epstein tiene sentido el vídeo
The real message Justin was trying to send is the problem with the sick bastard pedos on the industry.
La miniatura del video fue cambiada??
Podrian ser Epstein, George Lucas, John Podesta, Oprah
Aquí estamos viendo si realmente cambio la miniatura 🫨
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pizzagate">#Pizzagate</a>
Vine por las teorías de Jeffrey Epstein
Pizzagate...
Jeffrey Epstein brought me here
Ahora empiezo a entender cosas
O comentário em português <br>que você estava procurando  (:
hoy toma mas importancia esta canción alv
It&#39;s been four years and it&#39;s still very good.
Todo tiene sentido...
ahhhhhh ahora todo tiene sentido.
Todo esto tiene que ver el lo sabe
AHORA ESTO TOMA SENTIDO
Y nadie le hizo caso...
Yo después de ver la lista de famosos que fueron a la isla de jeffrey hahahaha
Pizzagate 👁???
He looks like the goalie for the women&#39;s Olympic soccer team
Al final del video aparece el vestido de la niña de rojo en uno de los asientos 😢😢
‼️‼️‼️Who&#39;s here after Epstein&#39;s list?There is an assumption that as a child, Justin Bieber visited the island of pedophiles. The clip &quot;Yummy&quot; has references where rich old people filthily consume food that children bring them. And at the end we see a childhood photo of the singer on a dirty saucer
All these music videos with clear as day messages, just like aviciis. It made sense then and certainly does now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=116">1:56</a>. Intentional video. Blood on the knife… Ask yourself why they made it look like that.
Justin saying he compromised out of fear or money <br><br>“keep me on the (the sexual acts or crimes could be done for the promise of constant fame &amp; money) rise, lost control of myself, I&#39;m compromised”<br><br>“You&#39;re incriminating, no disguise” and you ain&#39;t never runnin&#39; low on (money &amp; drugs,etc) supplies. <br><br>“Say the (morning or night he has to answer to the strangers needs.) word, on my way<br>Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe in the mornin&#39; or the late<br>say the word, on my way”<br><br>“Hop in the Lambo&#39;, I&#39;m on my way drew House slippers on with a smile on my face”<br><br>“Light a match, get (He has to get drunk &amp; do drugs before he can do all the evil things that’s asked of him… He get paid well &amp; can fly on private jets) litty, babe that jet set, watch the sunset”<br><br>He doesn’t get the money all to himself (“Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it hundred racks, help me spend it”) though. Because he doesn’t do the acts alone. Or he’s saying they group up &amp; all share his body 50/50<br><br>Sad song. 2024
It won&#39;t surprise me if something happens to Bieber, like it happened to Michael, Chester, Avicii and Chris Cornell, whatever happens to him and even if I was never his fan, Justin Bieber was a hero like the ones I previously mentioned.
Alguien más vino por el cambio en la miniatura?
💔💔💔
Cuando se lanzó el clip fue de avanzada.<br>Ahi me enteré del pizzagate
Alguien más vino aquí después de la última noticia con respecto al caso Epstein?
Here in 2024 after the infamous list came out. Wish we could’ve picked up more on the hintful messages when this first came out.
Song gones 4 years

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&amp;t=122">2:02</a> Oprah?
Venir al video después de que salgan los documentos del caso de Jeffrey Epstein refuerza la teoría de que la canción es sobre el pizzagate. Bien ahí Justin exponiendo de una forma sutilmente
all in Italy detest Grandr Bellezza i say strait away its oscar film i met people populating that movie myself
like in lars von trier films i think about Italy as fake , as estetics above all, any humanity , any content , any substance , theatricks in italy
I don&#39;t receive it . I am not apart of this table

WTF😢😢
WTF😢😢

JUSTIN I LOVE YOU I LOVED U SINCE I WAS A BABY UR THE BEST UR MY FIRST FAV SINGER I LOVE U SO MUCH!!!!!
Um dia vou gravar com vc
My heart breaks for J.B. 💔 He was literally served up on a plate to these monsters.  <br><br>It gets better, it did for me.  I took my power back, because it wasn’t my fault.  Whether it’s a corrupt industry, a corrupt family member or any adult for that matter.  Our story needs to be told, so we don’t keep reliving that trauma.  <br><br>I wish everyone dealing with S.A. peace and healing.
