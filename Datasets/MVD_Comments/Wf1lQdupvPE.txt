lol ios 17 is coming tomorrow
Hi Love
What iPhone are you using in this video?
TIL you can edit pictures on iOS. When did that get added? I&#39;ve been using iPhones since the 3G I think it was.
iOS 15
The pointless buffer relatedly trip because owl characteristically double times a alert license. taboo, ruddy frost
I know this might sound crazy but I like light better than dark
The invincible beat unfortunatly stay because twig cytopathologically stamp from a innate hand. receptive, crazy expansion
What i&#39;d be looking forward to is getting an iphone in the first place
Can I install iOS 14 on my 5s any one explain to me
Hey
YOO THAT INTRO FIRE!!
Who&#39;s here after IOS 14 is out?
rosalia
killerbean
Hello from Pilsen Chicago Illinois !!! I love technology too !!! I am happy and grateful to subscribe your channel !!!!! !!! YouTube rules !!!!!!!
Cant believe its a year old already
Me watching in IOS 14
After moving to ios13 and then 13.6 with its horrific effect on usage, connectivity and access to internet, I will be abolishing Apple devices from my household, so next upgrading of all tech will be android. Bye bye Apple investment
How did you not get COVID-19?
Very nice presentation. Good diction. Thank you.
Does the battery drain fast?<br> On older models. I have iphone 6S<br><br><br>It has done on mine since version 10. The compatibility has been neglected. Is it still neglected?

The video editing feature is really useful
Y tobogganing he go ugh had b back TV go gun Na smash glen GMC chi B.C. Co bc coming good blood going b FB gun gun gun hmm hm in n hmm hmm hmm hm hmm hmm hmm hmm hm b
You and your favourite feature have something in common...
Who’s here after the release of iOS 14
Who’s watching this after iOS 14 got released?
Why do people love IOS  like that
Video editor in stock app is great
Most of this is already well done on the android side and it im not even exited after hearing this, its nothing much. And here I was getting all excited perviously due to the hype
Just got back here after a year since iOS 13 was revealed!
I always hated Apple for not listening to consumers and adding necessary features, but now I see that this is changing ... The thing is: I always liked IOS but I always had an android since my Iphone 4s broke, I should go back Apple and give it a try or do I save a little and stay with samsung? (I know there are many more android devices like Pixel, Hawei, Lg, Motorola, Xiaomi, but samsung is the one I&#39;m most used to).
I remember dailying ios 13 beta since developer beta 2 last june/early july and honestly ever since devbeta 4 it was stable and ive never experienced rapid battery drain or crashes or anything like that. I also actually loved when the volume bar had 32 positions but they sadly reverted to 16 around devbeta 4 or 5
Just switched from a 6 to an 8 plus and iOS 13 is my favorite part of having it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=174">2:54</a>
best change is volume box
best feature no matter what is the ds4 and xbox controller support. (ds4 meaning ps4 controller dualshock four)
Beta yenga ma tharanga..<br>Pongalayum puliyodharaiyum potu kalichidraanunga..
Can my iPhone 5s still have this update?
Nothing was ever wrong with iOS every feature that they add it&#39;s just extra
Google Photos never got video editor option(╥﹏╥)
Wow I can do that too I’m swiping
Ohhh I have the IOS 12 cause it is IPhone XR
The worst thing is mixing up the 3D Touch with Haptic Touch. Screens capable of 3D Touch now respond to Haptic Touch which is very annoying.
I have iPad Mini 9.3.5 and I even can&#39;t download YouTube in it. Absolute garbage.
Dark mode looks sweet ❤️
Watching it on android for 2nd time (bcoz I love his voice) 😅😅😅😅
Dark mode and volume rocker.That’s pretty much it.
Tip: audio sharing doesn&#39;t work for two pairs of powerbeats pro
Dark Mode Demo &amp; someone screams out loud:<br>Craig be like: &quot;All right..!!&quot;
Iphone:GAY<br>Android:YAY
Cydia
i was mostly excited for dark mode too
currently have the iPhone 7 as of today and this new ios update and by far I have had no bugs or crashing am glad I waited
Just got the Pro... A little slow but was waiting for the 12. This whole Caronavirus thing has me freaked out that will have an impactful delay on production.
Hi bro can you do a video of head traking
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=175">2:55</a> Marques complaining about AT&amp;T’s 5G got me dead 😂
I had a Samsung for years and never used swipe typing
I luv ur channel bruv
I don&#39;t know if anyone noticed or it&#39;s just me but when YouTube and you full screen and you change the volume up and down the little bar will go up and down but there will be a fuzzy bit under the bar maybe like a cm thick fuzzy bar when turning volume up and down full screen mode in YouTube
@mkbhd you missed battery 🔋 optimization
I can’t really tell if I like this new keyboard or not cause it seems like it should be really buggy but somehow it isn’t and also you don’t have to be completely precise with it
Dark mode all the way 🙌🏽
I wish they go back to when you could just click Bluetooth or WiFi and it would fully turn of not that white thing it does where it only turns of half way?
I never use swipe typing
The scroll control on the keyboard was also on the S3 mini i used 7 years ago
good to know that mkbhd is a muse fan
I don’t know about you guys, but signing in with your Apple ID is a huge relief especially because it is self destructive and you have no worry to remember a password
The swiping to text is already on iPadOS but only when u make it small
The swiping to text is already on iPadOS but only when u make it small
for some reason for people who have iPhone 6’s we can’t even update the iOS 13, perhaps because their so desperate for us to buy the new updated iPhones (7,11, 11 pro max) etc. that’s just petty bruh🤡🤕
So it’s gonna be iOS 23 in 10 years and iOS 43 in 30 years !!
iOS 13 is such a big step, it’s so good
Hey MKBDH!! Where do you get matte black AirPods from?
How did you get your air-pods black?
Goodbye iOS from iPhone 5s
Bruh
Surprised you didn’t mention Siri shortcuts
A suggestion for the next IOS , the ability to change the mouse pointer
now you can make any wallpaper darker with dark mode!
Whats the use <br><br>why is APPLE not bringing back 3D touch in our latest older phones (iphone xs——,iphone 7) we so have that technology in out handsets imbedded so why take away from us something like that ?<br>Specially whn you have the control over your software as well as hardware <br>Why don’t you guys speak up !!!!!!!!???
Awesome video👍🏾. Please check out my latest video, I’m featuring the iOS 13 bug fixes
Will iPhone ever get split screen mode?
Love the vids bro
Well done iphone ❤️
The swipe keyboard does come on the iPadOS
3rd party apps are going to build in dark mode so that it will use the mode you have set for the UI, so one button will turn all apps on the phone to dark mode.(if the app supports it of course)
That swype thing its like in the xiaomi note 7
welcome to 2013 htc one feature, ios photos app.
My number one is that you can connect your ps4 or xbox controller tbh. :)
I did this and now my Health and other apps  went to a no use app.  I can&#39;t get the medical clinics in my area to add to my records and the ones I have in there, I can&#39;t access them.  I got apps in which  I will never use. If a enable them, there goes my battery life. I want to uninstall it. It just made my iPhone worse. I hate it.
No one talks about the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth selection from control center...
And you can capture the screen and there is a new option that’s called full screen its pretty dope actually
IOS 13 not beta. has so many bugs I wish I could switch back.
IOS 13 has so many bugs I wish I could switch back.
Dark mode is my personal favorite too.
The base iPhone 11 is not OLED
Hey just found one bug in ios 13... photos app getting closed if you scroll down very fast.. pls do check..✌🏻
E
MKBHD is your name?? <br>If yes then can you please tell me the full name ?
thought that the background was a confederate flag....
When he said we can rotate a video and change the filter of it I was like “That’s it. I’m updating.”
i’m so surprised, i have the iphone 7 and i updated and got the my moji thing! i’m so hapoy
After updating to 13 when I am in an app I can’t swipe up out of it but I can still swipe to unlock and swipe through apps. SOMEONE HELP ME!

They messed up the reachability. It was seamless in 12
Hey Apple Users<br><br>Where is Screen Recording Feature in iOS13....<br>It’s not there......👨🏻‍💻<br>Disappointing...😔😔<br>Screen Recording- a beautiful feature in iOS 12???
So all these features have been out on other phones and this is mind blowing. Um ok
Who is here after iOS 69
Features<br><br><br><br><br>Bugs*
Man<br>Lm hate samster5677 the makes grounded video out caillou
I love official iOS 13 so far especially dark mode and the new Animoji’s
Finally updated today! Anyone else?
Wow, more excited about the volume box than I should be
Welcome to 2014 Apple.
Those who wants to use Dark Mode in iOS12, try using Smart Invert. It is similar to Dark Mode. I am using Smart Invert for quite a while now..
Anyone here after iOS 13 finally came out?
Who’s watching this video on iOS 13 official release day? Me!!!!!! 🙋🏾‍♀️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=328">05:28</a> &quot;Kearny Works&quot; is the name of the WiFi. Could that be the middle name we were looking for all this time?
Does the audio share only work with AirPods?
I follow MKBDH...…   perfect. view
Man can they just give us spilling screen functionality for sake
Anybody know the wallpaper he used in this vid?
thank tour very much for the ios 13 review
No one talking about how in iOS 13 you can connect Xbox 1 and ps4 controllers? No? Ok.
can I play music while I record a video?
btw...really phenomenal content you are producing. recently came across your channel. love it!!
definitely most excited about ‘dark mode’. in tesla’s, they have a similar feature called ‘night’ mode. some tesla owners always have ‘night’ mode set as the default, not ‘auto’. i will be utilizing ‘dark mode’ more often than not. also love the swipe to text feature. :)
Objectively speaking, there is nothing and I mean nothing exciting about ios 13 🤦🏾‍♂️.  Apple is just sloooooowly loosening U.I restrictions and adding fundamental features that should’ve already existed yeaaaars ago. Still no close all button for running apps window , still cant resize apps and place them anywhere you want, the setting app is still cluttered, the “widgets” are still half baked, and still just not able to tailor your user experience.
I’m so excited for the new volume bar. The old one is so annoying
What about the calling like a notification
Damn black Airpods ! How did you get that MKBDH ?
I am waiting for iPhone SE 2 with iOS 13
iPhone 11 still uses LCD, not OLED.
Watch my XS max start slowing down
I like your style 👍 great video, very informative
What happened to the messages dark mode?
All that but they still haven&#39;t added a &quot;numbers line&quot; option at the top of the keyboard.
volume changing is the best new feature 4 show
WiFi setting
How to zoom in and out like you did in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=214">3:34</a> ?
I can receive a call on speaker while playing a game but on iPhone the game will be terminated if I take a call.
To switch off wifi or Bluetooth we couldn’t do in toggle menu but had to go to settings itself which takes couple of swipes. Hope that is rectified.
Excited about Photos app update and Dark Mode most.  Great video as always man.  Really enjoy your content, great video quality, editing and your overall presentation is fantastic.  Have a great week! 🙌
I LOVE the Bluetooth quick toggle. Finally!  Do you know if the iOS 13 public beta still super buggy?
All we need is to get rid of phone calls covering up the whole scren
Great video!
The best thing for me is the CarPlay changes
How do you set your aspect ratio?They&#39;re just perfect to watch in an iPhone X. YouTube should add this zoom option.
Do you even know what time the Guccis are come on
Do you even know what I wanna duty
MARK ASS BROWNLEE
Do I get the normal updates if I have already installed iOS public beta in my iPhone ?
I don’t see why they say it’s been buggy especially this close to the launch, I’ve been using it as a daily driver for around a month it’s fine
What about when someone calls you, it takes up the whole screen. Has this been changed?! 🤯
When, if at all, will IOS 13 becoming to older phones, like the iPhone 10 and 8
Swipe typing: Even when I was in android, I didn’t use it so meh.
How can I upgrade my XR?
I get my new phone the day IOS13 comes out will my phone come with IOS13?
Only if ios13 had a call recorder, I wouldn’t have had to quit iOS.
Battery is dieing like anything
Yo Marquees! I hope you see this comment. Being able to connect 2 airpods to the same source will open up a really cool way to watch a movie with a friend who doesn’t speak the same language as you! So let’s say you meet someone who speaks German but doesn’t understand English. You can have his airpods in German while yours are in English! Think about how cool that is!!!!
Funny how now that I have it I never use systemwide dark mode
Can u download ios 13 on iphone xr?
I downloaded it and it’s not buggy for me
Is IOS 13 gonna be compatible with the IPhone 6s
I have the ios 13 and I’m soo hyped
You can make a call from iPhone <br>People react 😮
Which modles of iphone will get this update
Still they didn&#39;t add number row to their key board.
ugh finally!! i love the pop up for the wifi! i had that for my samsung and i really miss that
When does iOS 13 come out for the general public?
Dark mode no.1 for me too bro
Finally more options to edit videos!!
I’m legit more excited about ios13 than I am for the actual iPhone Pro
Would be smart if they do that companies can ask you to accept if you want night mode enabled with your current settings from the os.
You didn’t put the word new in air quotes, you put the word new in quotations.
Share ETA from maps is cool!!
Still no Bluetooth ps4 controller connectivity?
Short and concise, thank you!
I wrote this by Swifting
Dark mode I can&#39;t wait to use it on my iPhone and iPad mini
How do you get rid of the home dock background?
That wifi thing is underrated, should be top 3
Will these phones have 5G when that becomes available?
THATS IT?!
Hey I don’t have profile on my iOS 12.4 in setting so do you know why
My favorite features is &quot;dark mode&quot; and &quot;volume box&quot; .but the keyboard update is not good. I like too gboard than Iphone keyboard.
Most excited about the Swype on the keyboard
can we download youtube videos from safari?
It’s happening people today is the day!!
THE VOLUME CHANGE AND DARK MODE fuckign finally
I’m your new subscriber liked your videos so much especially on Apple 🍎 devices
Sucks that the dark mode doesn’t work ok the iPhone XR
Best
The only iOS I’m hyped for😂
Seems like this piece of crud is getting a bit better. And what about security, btw?))
The volumen feature was wow!
Native controller support  is a nice geat feature for gamers or casual gameers
That emoji feature seems useless in comparison to the other features people really want and need. Sure it may be cool, but still useless.
After using the beta for a while I have to say...<br><br>Dark mode is fantastic
this  would be my last iphone i am using.
No Split Screen?
No mention of bluetooth controller support ?
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Marques has a picture with Babbish? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=220">3:40</a>
In between iPhone X and XS what would u suggest me ?
Me watching YouTube:Ya know this audio is kinda low<br><br>iOS 12 and under:I’m about to end this mans whole career
Hey Marques! You can only use audio sharing if you have the second generation AirPods
Cant wait for the new ios 13 <br>“We can control the video lighting like the photo”🔥🔥🔥
Which iPhone do you have?
Log in with Apple feature is very nice!!! 🙌🏼😍
that sign in with apple is fucking amazing, think about how many data leaks will have useless information from now on
I’m so excited for the new volume bar!!
When are they going to release iOS 13
Super excited for Swype I&#39;ve had the third party app since my iPhone 6
They should finally make it possible to shut down wifi completely from the control center.
iOS 13 to be the best update in Apple history needed to get rid of the screen hostage situation that happens when someone calls you. Go like Android and put that crap on the top like a text so we can ignore it in peace anyways.
react to ios 13.1 beta new heart eyes emoji. i almost threw up.
I have an iPhone XR and I can confirm the Face ID is 30% faster it’s sooo much faster
thanks for bringing back 4k team crispy
13 iterations of iOS and i still cant put my icons where I want
I don’t understand why they won’t update Siri. I don’t understand why Siri always wants you to look at your phone when there is so much effort being put into hands free and wireless. Google now assistant destroys Siri. To bad ios is so awesome!
I like very much all these features of iOS 13
video editing, huh cool!
Am I the only one that so annoyed with the WIFI toggle <br>Could it just be ON/OFF  NOT Disconnect -*-
Finally actuall volume
Optimized charging is still underrated in my opinion
Does the audio sharing only work with AirPods?
That’s weird that they added 3D Touch WiFi toggle when the iPhone 11 not gonna have 3D Touch.
My favourite update is the volume adjustment! Love it and finally it doesn&#39;t block my view whenever I watch a video. It took Apple a donkey years to have this •_•
So am I supposed to throw my iPhone X and buy the new one wtf
Definitely separate global keys and emojis
All these features are in Android for years except the audio one
I didn’t rlly think people cared abt the volume thing lmao
I hope there will be some notification dots egen the screen is turn off
Why is this video in my feed? Watched this long ago.
Man I I’m so psyched for this update. I think I haven’t been so excited for an update since the iOS 7 (the one that brought Siri to iPod touch 5 gen)
Mark ass brownie
When swipe typing existed more than 5 years already 🤔<br>Apple is so shit😶
Night vision on iPhone 🤞🏻
Saw muse origin of symmetry. Instantly subscribed
&#39;Ridiculous that this isn&#39;t 5g I demand a refund thank you&#39; 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nobody:<br><br><br>Android users: HuahuHaub wE alReAdY hAd tHAt anDRoIds bETtEr I liKe mY pHOnE eXPloDinG
The best feature was Babish in this video
Ok I have a Galaxy s10+ and ive had android  for a long time.I was curious on how iphone was like, would you say iphone would be better or no?
Appreciate the vid but Apple has become the non- leader in mobile software. However, I still can’t believe the stores are still full and crowded like a cult following. <br>Google platform is much more advanced it just is.
Love the updates
Does dark mode save battery life?
You can tell they hired a lot of jb creators
wallpaper
when we can install ios 13 in my phone? wat date come ios 13?
Downloading files larger than 200mb
Nigayyyyyyeeeeeee
Does an Apple Watch with os5 work with iOS 13 beta?
Android &gt; iOS
Babish!!
Excited about the new iOS. I participated in the beta but unfortunately had to remove it due to the bugs. My faves are the swipe text and dark mode. I couldn’t manipulate the photos as much as you because of the bugs.
Useless
Iphone users:  woah! Shared audio<br>NSA: oh yeah we loved that
That Mr. J song at the beginning though
Dark mode and volume rocker
already got ios 13
I don&#39;t have a iphone 😥😪😓😓
I still didn&#39;t get the difference between Smart Invert and Dark Mode. Any help?
Dark mode &amp; swipe... Hooray 😒😒😒
Can’t way to listen to the same songs with my imaginary girlfriend <br>Yay
all im excited for is swipe, i hate trygin to type on iphones
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=80">1:20</a> Why is the 12.3.1 using the ios 13 wallpaper and 13 using the ios 12 wallpaper
Where can I find that wallpaper??
Ew swipe typing 🤮 What are we Android users?
Omg they finally added swipe, <b>they&#39;ve finally added it</b><br><br>I am so happy I don&#39;t have to use the Google keyboard anymore, it&#39;s awful to regularly type with on iPhone.
You are the best
But the thing is how you trust a U.S company to not spy you?? when youre giving all the data to them and them only??
Will iPhone se in the list of update
I hope they fix so I can run youtube (Safari) in background like IOS 10
everyone loves dark mode
If every update was % faster my phone would be 300% faster right now, but it ain&#39;t.
Still no split screen 😕
Coming from android my favourite feature is the WiFi and Bluetooth selection from control center. Why wasn’t it there in the first place ?
Of course your dumbfuck ass doesn’t show if messages work in dark mode
Wallpaper please ?
Wallpaper please?
What of these are not available for xr
Is apple going to put the weather on the lock screen ?
How about IOS 13 stop charging for extra space , built in sleep tracking for Apple watch and having to delete messages from phone and watch . Apple still behind are certain things that&#39;s why I can&#39;t understand why they charge so much . Oh ! I know why it&#39;s a brand and status  look which Apple takes full advantage of . No phone is worth $1000 . Stop stealing from your customers without them you wouldn&#39;t be Apple. Greed is something else watching video from my Pixel 3a $400
ilove apple so much!!
I really wish Apple would allow more customization of the display. Just the simple stuff, remove dock, high contrast fonts app placement
Let’s not forget the auto photo and contact info share in contacts. That’s an underrated feature
I wanna be able to surf on the internet while i am watching a youtube video. Is that really so hard to add this on ios devices which are damn powerful
when the fuck will we get the multitasking feature goddamn it apple !!!!!
China: We’re creating an under display camera!<br><br>Apple: Darkmode!
How to get iOS 13
iOS 13 is full of shit that Android has had forever.
Mark ass brownie
Cool features!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=441">7:21</a>😂😂😂 volume box 📦
They still need a new interface it’s been the same since 2013 !!! When the 5s came out
Why did it take apple so long to have that keyboard?
Those guys put a lot of effort to protect your privacy against Google, Facebook etc. and this guy he&#39;s favourite feature is dark mode. What the hell!
Did you know <br>You can now additional stops along your route in Apple maps with iOS 13???  I don’t think anyone has brought this up yet. Apple said nothing about this in this keynote.
Do android
Using in my iphone 7 plus
Video rotation editing as standard Photos app feature is perfect! 👌
Apple could give us so much better, honestly idk why they’re so stupid with these things. They’re so slow with these features.
I want to be able to put my apps wherever I want on my background not just stuck with them going top to bottom
Dark mode came in accessibility under smart invert. So they mean they just made a quick toggle   Unless something has been added??
Reminders and Notes rework should be awesome. I use them a ton so I can only hope
Reading mail in dark mode is very odd or is a bug, specifically when you have attachments included. Before you had a small icon next to the mail, that seems gone but some attachments are very hard to find in dark mode.
Hey i installed the ios 13 public beta 2 in 6s plus device but ran in to some problems s specially in camera app slow motion does not work and crashes time to time. And i cant find the Safari download manager either so please be kind enough to look for those errors and review it. Still its in beta but its worth it to make a some kind of people’s voice. And keep it up the good work you doing. Thank you, guy from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰
大哥，加个中文字幕好不好，英语不好😂😂😂
Can you crop videos now?
Top 3 favourite things in the new update<br>1. Dark mode <br>2. Photos app revamped<br>3. Volume crap fixed finally
Cool
There has to be a reason a huge company like Apple wants to “protect your privacy” why does every other company want your information anyways? They claim it’s to improve technology, software, and for data science. So is Apple trying to keep everyone inside their private bubble or is everyone else trying to steal your info for some shady reason? I’d love some insight on this as I’m just an outside observer.
Will it come for 6 plus?
Does the XR have dark mode ?
But can you after downald ios 13 Beta downald new ios
*Sees volume update<br><br>Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeym
Does dark mood apply to messages?
I just want them change that loss of your entire screen when someone is calling.
This features had been given very earlier in android.<br>Apple badly need new CEO
My no phun
Who else is watching with iOS 13
all discousting
When do you think they will have iOS 13 out with no bugs or not as buggy
You’re waiting for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=297">4:57</a>
Is there a set date of when iOS 13 will be released?
Tbh I want to download iOS 13 but I’m scared it could damage my phone since it’s not out yet :/ my friend downloaded it and said it’s really cool and it didn’t damage her phone
will there be more emojis?
DARK MODE
There should be an improvement in camera feature <br>Like Switch the camera from front to rear... or rear to front WHILE VIDEO RECORDING.
I want new emojis. I love using them.
I’m ready for new emojis.
I wish they also included a fix for the &quot;lock my  iPhone/take a screenshot&#39; annoyance. I take a screenshot by accident almost every day wenn trying to lock my iPhone XS.
I know my mom&#39;s stoked for that swipe keyboard.
Dark mode is amazing
Bummer that phone calls still fill up the whole damn screen in 2019, iPhones really moving at coral reef growth rate 🤦🏾‍♂️
Still no complete without working on the annoying call thing
MKBHD, would you recommend ios over android?<br>I mean its functionality, speed, stability etc.
IOS 13 released ?
Do you know when iOS 13 will be released?
iphone 6 ios 13 not supported
Dark Mode <br>iPhone 2019<br>Google phone 2019<br>Windows Phone 10 years ago
Is that iphone 11 or iphone xs max
that volume feature is good one. the last one is a garbage
Any idea when we’ll have the option to change the font ??
Oh
The best feature is HANDS DOWN the fact that you can finally rotate your videos that were recorded the wrong way
It screws up your phone so bad
Just found your videos, I like your clear style and easy to listen to voice. You don’t over burden points and get the info across quickly!
How do you get beta
Where did u get these black AirPods from?
So wasn’t it suppose to be out to the public on the 3rd ?
You explain shit so clear &amp; professional
Wen duz dis cum owt?
I love everything about the iPhone except the   Calculator 🙄🙄
What iPhones does the photos app apply too
Just got it
Dark mode is here baby.
Don’t get iOS 13 beta I got it I have the iPhone X and my whole phone froze nothing would work including the buttons I couldn’t do anything I had to wait for it to die
Intro song name?
Writing from iPhone SE with iOS13
I got iOS beta 2 and it isn’t buggy at all it’s very cool and you can connect a controller to your iPhone pretty cool not gonna 🧢
Anyone know where to get that iPhone wallpaper?
Is all great designs ,but it won’t be stable unless you keep buying there new products
SWIPE TYPING!!!
Marques  i really liked your video best feature is the dark mode and volume button  , may i ask a question does the air pods 2 wireless case support 5W charging mat ??? thank you mate peace
Been an iPhone user ever since smartphone became a thing and abandoned it more than a month ago. I thought dark mode on iOS will only exist in my dreams. Wow. Time to mess with my Mom&#39;s iPhone😈😈😈
Is it worth it over a jailbroken phone? I only jailbroken my phone for music
Please let me know which is the best smartphone available right now: Iphone, Oneplus 7Pro or Samsung S10 Plus, Especially the camera feature.
How do I make snap or insta dark mode
I can&#39;t wait for the update it seems like its going to be dope.
Is public beta 2 coming out on july 1??
How can I install this public beta version?
I hope you can revert the volume one because I really liked the clear separate digits for volume control.
I also have the beta ios 13 and I didn’t get the new wallpapers:/
Where did you get the black skins for your AirPods
About dark mode, does it switch the color of the keyboard too? For example for the messages app. Because youtube, Twitter and apps that you/we can toggle, the keyboard automatically switches to dark. Just want a bit of clarification for that, please and thank you.😊
I joined iPhone right on time god damn
You can also use a game console controller on ios 13
I only want this for the darkest of dark modes and finally being able to add wifi networks from the multitask screen thank goodness
one quick Q why ur AirPods r black like really black is that a sticker or idk
Im loving this update so far all the new features are great best software update I did
Awesome awesome video!
That’s awesome the force touch to search networks and Bluetooth
The UI looks like google photos lol
For like ever lol.
i have always believed that a phone should ask for a passcode when i’m switching it. if they could add that
Did u download iOS 13 ??
It still amazes me that ios is STILL trying to catch up to android/Samsung Oneui
When is iOS 13 coming out
They’re always too late with their updates I don’t know why. People have been using swipe, dark mode and other features on their Androids for a very long time now. Apple isn’t special by being late and they think they’re special.
They need to make a feature where incoming calls don’t take up the whole screen that way I can still be on Instagram and ignore calls that I don’t wanna answer
Wireless Controller Support
Should I wait for the jailbreak for iOS 12.2 or just update to iOS 13???<br><br>Edit: I’m really fond of the tweaks when jailbroken but the dark mode and volume thing sounds really good too.
so is it true that when the real update comes out whoever downloaded the beta it will become really glitchy and can crash your phone, because i’m kinda paranoid since i have the beta💀
Seems dope...can’t wait to see it in action
just want ignorable calls
I’m using iOS 13 also
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=136">2:16</a> WHAT!!!! YOU LISTEN TO MUSE. COME ON MAN. THAT’S SO COOL!!!!!
Does it work on the iphone 7?
Bro i hope apple just looting and they still not include SPILT SCREEN like in Android
For sure the video editing! That is sick!
Dark mode is the most improvement I’m looking forward to ! And the sign in with apple ...that’s is very nice and secure ...I don’t care for emojis
might try and swicth to iphone sometime
I honestly hope they put the photos update and the dark mode in the 2018 ipad 6th gen too
THAT NEW VOLUME BOX IS MY FAVOURITE
Can you a video on how to download the update <br>Coz I’ve been trying to do it and there’s no new update on my phone i.e, iPhone XS Max. <br>That would be really helpful
apple stop adding shit no one uses and get the fastest charging possible onboard!
My biggest pet peeve is when I&#39;m watching youtube videos in landscape mode and I can&#39;t fast forward or rewind without moving between apps
Are they making it so you don&#39;t have to unlock the phone to adjust the ringer volume?
You can rotate video&#39;s in iOS 12 too though
lol swipe typing is such a joke. It&#39;s like, &quot;let&#39;s see if we can design the slowest possible input method&quot;. Stoked on Dark mode, really hoping the speed improvements are real. I keep waiting for them to do a pass on slow animations because a lot of the stuff (like the animation that happens when you plug the phone in) take entirely too long and present a shitty user experience if I ever saw one.
apple really tryna put app makers out of business
I like the aspect ratio that you use cuz when you zoom to fit it barely moves and dosent really cut stuff off
Am I the only one that thought he had a confederate flag on his wall for a split second
Can I get IOS 13 on my iPhone 7?
Bye volume box, u can rest peacefully in hell now
So basically just catching up with Android!!!!!. I just wish I had the balls to make the transition over. As much as I love the seamless connectivity of iPhone it still lacks so much that android offer.
My budget for a new phone is about £300 what android phone would be best?
This stuff is hot trash. Literally nothing new or groundbreaking apple slowly dying out
Iphone is shit
Mark ass brownie lol
The ability to switch off WiFi and Bluetooth radio from the Control Centre, that&#39;s needs to be brought back too!! It&#39;s a hassle going into the settings every time.
Will live wallpaper capability come to XR after iOS 13 is released?
Didnt zune allow you to share an entire song?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=217">3:37</a> heh binging with babish
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=140">2:20</a> best. fuckin. album
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=173">2:53</a> &quot;thats not real 5g i want a refund&quot;😂😂🤣
Do you guys think iOS 13 is worth losing a jailbreak for? Honest opinions only!
Hey Marques <br><br>On my iphone i&#39;m not getting an update for IOS 13 ? <br><br>How to get my phone update?
Swipe typing is possibly the dumbest fucking idea I&#39;ve ever witnessed it&#39;s just dumb
The thing that frustrates me the most since switching from the android is the multi task thing....it’s really annoying not to have this until now 😡
This video made me want to upgrade my iPhone
Apple living in 2013 lol
How are your airpods black?
I installed the beta, but the keyboard swipe thing doesn’t work:(
When are people gonna get it?
Typing this on iOS 13
Nice video
Hey!<br>Good work with summing up iOS 13 features, but I noticed 2 things to clarify:<br><br><br>1) Dark mode:<br>In future it might also be available in 3rd party apps,<br>but it depends on the each app owner.<br><br><br>Apple made it possible for 3rd party programmers to adjust their apps to the dark mode. It does NOT happen automatically - it needs programming work. Probably most of big companies will adjust their apps, so it will be possible to remove in-app dark mode switches, and just react to the switch in Settings.<br>Because it needs to be programmed and tested - it might take few months for some apps to be dark-mode compatible. And not all companies will decide to do this, because it can cost a lot.<br><br><br>2) Faster app download &amp; faster app launch:<br><br><br>These might be not much faster in Beta,<br>but it can be faster after official release of iOS 13,<br>and after new versions of apps in AppStore,<br>that will be built with new Xcode and - later on - converted to Swift 5.<br><br><br>Apple introduced Binary Compatibility in Swift 5.<br>What it means - in previous versions of Swift language,<br>the programming language itself changed a lot from version to version.<br>In a result - every application, together with its own code, needed to keep whole pack of Swift executables (about 10 MB of binaries!), that were used when launching this app.<br><br><br>In Swift 5 and higher,<br>application will not need to do this - system itself will keep one copy of Swift executables that can be used for all applications.
looking forward to dark mode
Shit... Dark mode will make me finally get an iPhone
Where did you get the black AirPods??
ios 13 wiil be available for 6s or not?
I have a question: the charging issue in iPhone XS, does it get fixed with software update to iOS 13?
I got the beta and I have an xr and it gave me 3d touch
Is audio sharing just for AirPods ?
What about app lock??
So dark mode was the number one thing people waited for?
is it released
Still no customization of the home screen?
Great, now they are were android was years Ago. Again
I am so sorry for apple users. This is nothing new in android world.
Still doesnt let you turn off wifi and bluetooth from the control center
These features made me switch back to ios(from android) and update to 13 beta 2 😎
Mark Ass Brown Lee
WHERE IS THE DUAL APP SPLIT SCREEN??????
I’m so hyped for Dark Mode I love dark mode on everything and it’s honestly life changing
I’m gonna miss the old volume rocker logo but at the same time it was out-dated, annoying, and garbage lol so glad it’s gone
They FINALLY!!!!!! Added swipe keyboard, DAMN! I had that on my Samsung Galaxy phone when I was in 7th grade and haven’t had the amazing feature since. I’ve always wondered when Apple was going to release it, if at all. I’m now a sophomore in college and they’re barely coming out with it, about time but why did it take so long? Lol
i’m so happy about dark mode tbh
Why am I watching this I have an iPad and a Pixel
𝐍𝐲𝐜
They should make an Iphone where you can charge your airpods in
Mark ass brownie
The photos grid thing was already on apple watch
Finally playing catch up with Android
i like how smoooth he touch/swipe the ip screen
i like how smoooth he touch/swipe the ip screen
Gotta give to iOS for thee most intuitive photos app I&#39;ve ever seen
Thanks tour very much too
I am afraid iOS 13 will not run on Apple iPhone 7 Plus
Everyone copies apple’s hardware, but apple copies everyone’s os
Does anyone know if they&#39;ve fixed or plan on fixing the shitty (front) camera on Iphone Xs? Referring to the low contrast/over the top noise reduction...
Ahhhh I’ve been waiting for dark mode for FOREVER!! So glad it’s came
IOS is so satisfying ,clean and simple compared to android(personal opinion)
Dark mode available on iphone XR?
I really love iOS ...it’s always challenging and beautiful to use ..making d impossible possible...and pls to d Samsung and Unsecured Android users..don’t try to use iOS cuz u gonna get lost ..😂😂😂
Except security there is nothing special in apple updates. I made a mistake of coming back to iphone after selling iphone 6. Definitely going back to Android. Iphone is not even smart phone when compared to Android in options
Does audio sharing work with beats?
I want that wallpaper it’s look awesome
I dont know why i m watching this vedio bcoz i m a Android user
Bro which brand is that wireless bluetooth device besides airpods in the video?????????? DOES ANYONE HAVE IDEA ABOUT IT????
mark ass brownie
Volume for sure
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=434">7:14</a> Volume bar fix 👏🏻
Welcome to android
That volume is probably biggest to me lolol Dark Mode will be tight too
I downloaded iOS 13.1 on my iPhone 8 and i wasn’t able to use swipe keyboard and the volume
I have a IPhone 5
you forgot optimized battery charging
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=366">6:06</a> youtube has entered the chat
Top.. Awesome
Question about the audio sharing:  Is there a maximum number of earphones that can be connected?
Is it true that’s IOS 13 will let you use any wireless controller or something along that line?
Thanks! Great summary
How is the old volume system ridiculous?
mark ass brownie
So how do you get the beta for iOS 13?
A hack for iPhone users when you missed type something and you want to delete press down your pace button and move it to where you need it 😁 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Another one when you typed something really long and you deleted on accident you can shake your phone easy and tap undo 💓💓
Is iOS 13 going to be on IPhone 6s?
Guys what is iOS 13 is it a new phone I’m just wondering because I have a iPhone XR is iOS 13 a phone update
that volume ui, looks exactly like miui by xiaomi.... and the features, dude... Android has it already....  what are they doing for that much money?
Good job Markass brownie
Will iPhone 7 get iOS 13
For all the people that keep saying that android has already had these features: If I cared enough about those features I would own an android but I don’t. And when I bought my iPhone I didn’t do it because of what it didn’t have, I bought it for the features it does have and because I like it. When these “new” features get added it’s simply a bonus, and obviously many other people feel the same because millions of people own iPhones. So no you’re not better or cooler because your android has it, no one cares.
o my gosh i did you know i bought the iphone xr just 1 month before the ios 13 realsing date
Is it out yet, and if it is, is it out for the iPhone 7?
when is the new apple watch coming out
Apple is amazing
I don&#39;t have an iPhone but Dark Mode looks good, even though I have it on my Galaxy. Dark mode is always the best though
Keyboard swiping has been on Samsung FOREVER
watching this on my android
what is the point of 3D touch in WiFi or Bluetooth, i mean in the background u can&#39;t do anything extra, that 3D assistant kind of helps though in some cases while using other apps
What about selfie camera is so zoom in they not gonna fix it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=179">2:59</a> thanks tour very much??? and refund, those were auto generated messages , are those not?
by the time i buy Apple products , it is iOS 15 at least , no, it is 18 or 19, if it exists
Mark ass brownie
I&#39;m done with apple products. They come out with a new phone every year and the old ones just get slow and glitchy as fuck purposely for you to buy the new one and they break way easier than galaxy products. Fuck apple they just want your money
Finally the menu for wifis and bluetooth. I also wish they could make that silent switch into unlock rotation switch like with the ipad. I’m a huge movie geek and make that call a notification rather than taking up the screen
Ok i love all this but when will i be able to still play youtube on the background???!!! 😩
I have an xr coral :(
When is iOS 13 releasing? My iPhone is still on iOS 12.3.1 and says software is up to date
When does IOS 13 come out officially???
Inbuilt Video editing💯🙌🏻
Hello I’m currently swipe typing on IOS 13
I think apple now let us use File browser capabilities in iOS official music app, so that we can browse and playback songs stored in files app! Doesn’t that sounds great 👍!? Hit like if you support! 😬
i thought when someone calls you, instead of the full screen that pops up... you’ll get a notification?!? I guess not.. 🙃
So hyped for September
Apple bouta get sued for swipe text
How are you guys getting copies of iOS 13 before the open beta
When are they going to enlarge the alphabet on the artists list ???????
Why didn’t I get iOS 13 yet?
The god damn volume had to be my favorite
LMAO Android is better
Wait do iPhone XR get the update? And do you have to pay? <br><br>I’m sorry, I don’t know much about iPhones. My dad is usually the one that gives the whole family the phones and we just use them.
Not gonna cap iOS is so far behind
Mark ass brownie
Walt very nice. Wedding with my app
又想骗我升级
Samsung devices have had that Bluetooth audio sharing feature since the S8. It&#39;s called Dual Audio
How do you get ios13?
Why do ppl like dark mode?
also iOS 10 supports controller like Xbox and PlayStation now
Is Apple that far behind Android?!
Features their trying to showcase already exist in android. So why stay on this crap technology?
Mark ass brownie
Dark mode for iPhone se
Is this coming on I phone 8
Does the shared audio only work for AirPods?
Who else is exited?!
Can’t believe it has taken them this long to change that flipping volume pop up 😂  and wait for that, probably what I’m most looking forward to and then along with everyone else, dark mode. 😊
When does the ios 13 come out for ussssss😭🤔
It looks as Android more than Apple
Woah. You use AT&amp;T prepaid too??
Dark mode already existed its just in accessibility
What phones are compatible with IOS 13 ?
Top features and changes ios 1-13 would be great...
Another market strategy by apple, it still doesn&#39;t fit 2019 tech expectations, just minor upgrade, nice review
Mark ass brownie
MKBHD can u make a video about Sony Xperia 1?
Swipe to text!!! Finally!!
I swear iPhones are getting uglier and uglier
I’m an apple user but i can honestly say that iphones are shit.
That intro “so you don’t have to” is so over used, youtubers need to stop saying that. It’s just annoying. I swear some just say it for the heck of it.<br><br>MB: “I sat for 2.5 hrs at apple’s keynote so you don’t have to”<br><br>Rest of the world: it’s not like everybody can go to Apple’s keynote. Not everyone is invited.
It was possible to rotate videos before, though it was a bit tedious. From the Photos app you could send the video to iMovie. Here you could rotate it and do other edits after which you could export it back to Photos. It&#39;s great that they&#39;ve finally enabled video editing in Photos and it seems to be a lot more powerful than iMovie. Having to rotate the video is only relevant if the phone has misinterpreted the initial orientation.
omg i’m gonna be so happy when  swipe typing launches!!<br><br>edit: I just finished the video and now I’m SOO excited for this update knowing that they upgraded the photos app to do further editing with photos and video!! also, the volume adjustment and the dark mode. can’t wait!!
Does this all not work w iPhone XR am I dumb ??
So ios 13 has basically everything Samsung has other then the bluetooth thing. And people say Samsung copies Apple.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=170">2:50</a> When you&#39;re actually telling the truth
Sir how does a man get or approach and attach such thing on my iphone 7
So nobody saw the black AirPods
Trash good thing im with samsung and you should too
iPhone 6?
I have no idea how to use the swipe keyboard
Wait why are you having iOS 13 wallpaper on iOS 12 and iOS 12 wallpaper on iOS 13???
@MKBHD anything big with the new Apple CarPlay update?
airpods black whre do i get those custom
iOS 12 jailbreak has most if not all of these features
When is ios 13 coming out?
When is coming out?
Ah yes, calling it a feature, even though androids had it for almost 7 years
What’s the difference from dark mode and smart invert?
I can‘t wait for iOS 13 and especially iPad OS 13. It‘s going to be awesome!
who else is watching this with ios 13
Should I install beta on my daily use device? Is it worth it?
Two things missing they should add : 1 - Being able to just ignore calls. Swipe them<br>Up or something so they don’t take your whole screen. 2 - Giving us back the option to turn off WiFi from the control center. I mean a real turn off
Wowow at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=80">1:20</a> it’s totally messed up! For those who didn’t see, the iOS 13 is on the left not on the right
Whatever the topic is of your videos... I always watch them because you create such high quality content!
Did they announce the release date?
when is it coming out! i wanna update my phone already 🤩🤩🤩
I thought apple will ask for extra money to take out the volume. thanks god they take that off. I can&#39;t tell you how disturbing that volume bar.
now I&#39;ll be just waiting for the day when MKBHD &amp; babish collab
How about the phone call UI? Like when u receive a phone call, is it still full screen? Really bugs me when I play a game.
Mark ass brownie
Thanks Marques!
I think something really important that apple seems to overlook is granting us the ability to rename bluetooth devices! Actually gets confusing when connecting to different bluetooth speakers.
They are making iOS faster and faster then they will say people don’t buy new iPhone why why I will be purchasing new iPhone or iPad if it working too good.
Ok so they are basically just stealing things from android now lol
I’m very excited for the Fortnite on IOS 13
Its not compatible to iphone 5s am i right?
Im immediately jumping on the first public beta the second it drops. CANT WAIT FOR DARK MODE
Mark ass brownie
He never talked about the use of PlayStation and maybe xbox controllers for games
How do I download the demo version of iOS 13?
Wait, does dark mode change the white keyboard to black as well?
Watching this on Android
Will IOS13 be on the new iPad Pro
FINALLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYY ONE OF THE MANY THINGS I MISSED ON MY ANDROID WAS HAVING A SWIPING KEYBOARD
Its  so funny that apple users are so happy to have the volume display go away instead still have the big notch blocking their viewing. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
iOS getting dark mode is such a big deal. I like Android, but I also don&#39;t like Google&#39;s data mining. iOS was so unappealing with all of the blinding white everywhere, especially considering all of the wasted space in stock apps. With a dark theme, I can at least consider it as an option if Google pushes me away.
Samsung did that audio thing in 2013
they should make phone calls notifications, instead of taking up your whole screen🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
I’m so f&amp;@#+ng executes for iOS 13
carplay
Nice shirt bro! I love my LGBTQ+ community.
Wait I&#39;m confused<br>The Ios Improvement are making it more like android??😂
I&#39;m excited to when they update the app icons, (i hope they do :P I WANT THEM TO)
still no split view mode :/ iphone xs max is a big phone, it should have the ability to play youtube and browse instagram etc at the same time
does anyone know what the cut offs are?
If they give it all what they’ll do in ios14. It’s cool.
Every time I see his videos , I want him to marry me , sounds insane , yes to me too.
When u play geometry dash and u press to turn the volume down on iOS 12<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>*DIES*</b>  gosh apple get rid of this stupid box thing
looking forward to volume
mark ass brownie
Rlly can’t wait for iOS 13 to drop its deffo gunna be a mazza I’m in love with Apple 💙💙✅🙏🏾💯💯💯💯
why isn’t iOS13 available for the iphone x?? it doesn’t show up by me??
How do you get iOS 13?
This one of the best iOS updates
dark mode and volume rocker is revolutionary.
It&#39;s so expensive man, can&#39;t even think to buy. :D
ios 13 = my jailbroken ios 12
Can we get the feature now?
I just switched to android again and now ios looks so promising and fresh fml 😭
I miss my 3D Touch on ios 13 beta
thank tour very much
markass brownie
mark ass brownie
things i’m looking forward to: volume HUD on the side. <br>i also hope they update the incoming call screen to show up as a larger notification rather than take up the whole screen
Thx MKB for this video
Can you have Memoji or Animoji on iPhone 8 or no
Hello
Did they ever fix the annoying volume icon that blocks the center of the screen when adjusting the volume?<br><br>This should have been fixed since like iOS 8... All they have to do is relocate it to the bottom or top of the screen
is iphone xr gonna let you have live wallpapers though? 🤷‍♀️🤨
How come you have iOS 13 and I can’t get it
Fuck dark mode, you’re telling me I can watch hentai without the volume bar in the way,
I wish they included a split screen/multi tasking for large phones.
The Volume dialog has been finally changed .. OMG !! My guess is that they kept forgetting to change it every year. They knew how annoying it was, they knew other apps improvised ..
When using dark mode apps built against iOS 13 will dynamically change with your system setting, not using the in app toggle.
The only thing I care about is the controller support for Xbox and playstation Controllers
many of feature are we already used in windows phone and android  so nothing new in ios 13
Sad that android had swipe typing for so long for like 3 years lol
I saw the message you are trying to send to AT&amp;T lol
How do I get iOS 13??
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=80">1:20</a> put that in playback speed 0.25 thank me later or like that comment so other people see it
Mouse support?
mark ass brownie.
So basically we just getting what Samsung had since forever ok cool
Not that evolutionary, in my opinion. But Apple is selling this like that. When comes the big step at Apple? The updates come just nearer to that what we have on Samsung
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾swipe
And you can connect your iPhone with a PS4 or X box controller
Dark mode was already a thing .....
So, basically all the stuff that has been in android for 10 years?<br>Lmao, welcome to 2019 itoddlers
YIOO ITS MARCASS BROWNIEE
Is this markis brownie?
can ios 13 downoload big apps over cellular and not mandatory to download over Wifi... (worst past expereince/ back to android)
Describe your 2014 in one word: M&amp;Ms
So when is it coming for everyone ??
Hey do beta get automatic updates for new bats if I download?
Apple copying Android with the swipe keyboard and the volume box change and acting like they&#39;re the first ones to do it... Get some creativity Apple smh
Anybody can help me. Im using iphone 8 plus,  i cant active my predictive text in my phone. I dont have an option in my keyboard setting. Anybody know how to show it again?
I think new features on files app could make it to the list
Please do it for iphone 6...
does anyone else not have iOS 13 on the iPhone XR ?
is there a solution for the iphone xr that doesn’t have 3d touch?
Hey Friend<br>I m still waiting for new upgrading iOS 13 but there is nothing pop up about updating in Qatar 😏
If always had swipe typing
This sucks

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=168">2:48</a> So I’m not the only one that texts carrier robots back
ios 13 also comes for iphone 7
Nice waste of time watching your videos.
‘It’s basically a rewind’<br>Me: Don’t talk about that
ISheeps will think that this is a new feature lol...,these features were present on Samsung devices since 2013 😂
Sooo iOS 13 is coming out Fall?
Are you able to connect your consle controllers? ( Xbox/PS4)
Coming close to converting to android :)
Can you get on any iPhone X??
Finally is caught up with windows phone 🤣✌️
Did iOS 13 even come out yet?
I think the only other major update missing here, is the whole new Maps. But otherwise, love the review. Short and sweet and tells us what we really care about. 😂
How do we get the beta?
Any feature to hide the notch?
What iPhone is that he reviewed?
The sound isolation in the background looks like southern states flag
Photos features look awesome!
It’s crazy how everyone seems to accept how behind Apple is with certain features that they should have had years ago, yet everyone still loves them
Dark people like the dark mode
I’m switching to Android for two reasons: ridiculous prices and no customization of apps layout, especially when u have more than 100
The swipe thing seems complicated
Amazing video, straight to the point. I hate watching 20 minute videos when I want to see like one thing 🤧😂😂
Fan of you from india i really like ur reviews bro keep going 🤗🤗
Soooo...nothing impressive at all 😑
Nothing really meaningful happening, but people still make a lot of noise... okay 🤷🏻‍♂️
Can you download ios 13 on a iPhone XS Max?
can you use the dark mode on non oled iphones like iphone 7
Omg dark mode and the sound display.. FINALLY!!
THDEY FINALLTY FIXXDES THE VOOULUMME PRLOBRLRLEMMM AFTTRR 10 FUUDGDCKKIFKFNNNG YYRESAARSAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Omg u had 11 years to have 8million mashaa allah💙💙💙
so when does ios13 come out??
Android may had swipe keyboard a lot longer, but when Apple does something it&#39;s always the best!
How about ip 7 . This sofware r working also ???
it more like changing the theme, Samsung gives a whole lots of options when it comes to that
Dark mode sucks for me, i dont understand why u like it so much
All IOS 13 Features:<br>Sign in with Apple ID<br>Volume Rocker<br>Dark Mode<br>Emoji Customization<br>Photos &amp; images customization<br>Wifi &amp; BT menu Pop up.
The best features in iOS 13 is the dark mode and volume hud but still no always on display
Dark mode needs icons that remove all of the white as well...
Basically like my jailbroken iphone
Well Organized
Who is android user but still watching this video...
Thank you it wa sso helpful defininetly share music and dark mode. Do ozu know something about a new apple watch?
It has come on my ipad
I love all the changes 😍 @mkbhd
Like who are still watching this video on IOS 9.
2 years ago i used to debate Android is better and adopting new technologies than APPLE ..<br>.<br>now they proved me i should debate on better things Apple already looking as like as scrap 😂💯😂
Wait a second.... at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=85">1:25</a>, the versions are opposite. (According to the wallpapers)
Thank god for Memoji updates I need that for my YouTube channel 😂💯
mark ass brownie
iPhone 6 why can’t give iOS 13
Does it work on the XR, it’s not working on mine
Still sad you still get stuck in the call page when you get a call ): I hope they fix that
Will IPhone 6s get iOS 13?? If you know can you answer 🙏🏾
When is iOS 13 coming? I’m waiting anxiously! Very cool the dark mode and the new wallpapers!
I want that wallpaper so bad!
Smh why didn’t you go to messages! I wanted to see it with Dark mode🤬🤬🤬
I am still wondering how apple could save their iPhone....We basically know everything about the next generation. notch still there, weird camera...  🙉🙉🙉
😤😤 how is iPhone only just now getting the Gboard feature?? I can&#39;t even type on my iPhone keyboard anymore because I&#39;m so used to swiping
Cant wait to do the public beta in July! dark mode and volume UI here I come!!
Finally I can delete the SwiftKey keyboard for Swype lmao
Do you  have any other iPhone there
Yup
Black Airpods sitting on your table... they’re not released yet, are they? Unless they’re copies.<br><br>Anyway my favourite in iOS 13 has to be the iPod share mode for two people to listen to the same music or movie (wanted something like this for years).
I’m getting an XS soon, pretty excited for all these features
📱The best 👌one is the video 🌫editing feature <br>I really wanted to crop videos and 🛠edit⚒them<br>This time it’s here 😄😍
iPhone 7 users: RIP
Are we going to have iOS 13 on iPad mini 4
nun of this stuff is on my phone rn
In my opinion the most useful update is the Wi-fi selection thing, I’ve been waiting this feature for years...
iOS 13 : New video editing feature<br>Adobe Premiere Pro : Am i a joke to you
All iPhones are getting this right?
I use GBoard specifically for Swype texting, and I use an app to rotate videos. So this update will help me delete extra apps? 🥴<br><br>The dark mode/volume adjustment can be nice too. I use dark mode on YouTube
@Babish
Ahh I love it
Dark mode and Find are the best
A great, not talked a lot about feature, is that now, when taking a screen shot, say from a news clipping page in an email, the messages app allows you the option to either share only the screen shot, or share the entire page as a .pdf. Much appreciated Apple.
K20 PRO
Love swiping keyboard. Been using this for around 5 years and love it. But I do have an android Samsung which swiping has been built in for an age... soo easy and fast to use.
Thank you for recording in wide mode!!! My iPhone X loves it!
What is going to be the price of iPhone XS after the release of the new iPhones in September?
music sharing is the best one.
useful thanks
I can&#39;t believe it took 13 iterations to fix the volume adjustment issue.
How do u get the beta
The WiFi/Bluetooth selection and the volume icon changes are the best fixes.
Is ISO 13 is also available in iPhone XR????pls ans plsss
Great video 👌
Hi
Hey, I saw the little note during dark mode saying “not in iPhone XR” is that just for wallpaper dimming? Battery life? Or dark mode in general?
I don’t have the IOS 13 update yet!
Little do people know you can rotate videos in iMovie. Yeah it’s $5 and you have to wait for export but it’s possible. Highlight the clip, pinch and twist on the video screen the direct you’d like to rotate. Twist twice and your video is completely rotated.<br><br>Also, is iOS 13 coming to iPhone SE? 😁.
Good boy.
I use dark mode and had for two years by just going INVERT lol it’s cool. But I like the photos ifmdndjjdd
Who else didn’t get an update? 😂
With all the damn money Apple has you think they could afford to give us more than just a few token updates every year.
Haircut pending ...
DARK MODE
Origin of Symmetry is an amazing album!
Mark ass brownie.         Ahhhaha that’s hot
How do u get the beta
Thanks 👍
wait do normal iphone X’s also get ios 13 ?
Wi-Fi selection through control center... that&#39;s the one feature I wish iOS had, and now here it is!
Why don’t they introduced something for XR like camera upgrade so that people who are using it (including me) can use portrait mode better ??
The Review by editorji adds more to this informative video. Thanks Marques for the explainer. The Review by editorji adds more to this informative video.
Im reluctantly new to owning an iphone but can you multitask an incoming call without hanging up or waiting for the call to end? I hate my youtube videos to interrupted by goddamn facetime calls lmao!
Mark ass brownie
Yeahhhh Muse!
Great vid really informational I appreciate it😇
I love the fuckin dark mode..
People can finally ROTATE a video. From now on vertical video should be banned.
Voice UI for the win!
This is actually the first time I’m looking forward to a photos app update.
Yo dark mode is already a thing. You have to enable it in settings and triple tap the off button
Mark ass brownie
oh yeah. i even use &#39;Invert colors&#39; most of the time at nights. this is so f*cking awesome man!
I still hav iOS 12 I check y updates in settings it not there
I’m so happy they fixed the volume, but I’m still waiting for the split screen that android has had for ages. They finally put it on their iPads, but I need it on the iPhones 📱
Are calls still going to take all the screen or just the top?
What is the release date for this?
I only care about Dark Mode 😍 the rest are cool though. Looking forward to the official launch of iOS 13.
So will all this stuff work on the iPhone XR
So our phones still have a nervous breakdown when we get phone calls🤦🏾‍♂️
Great video
genuinely curious, does anyone use swipe typing? even if regular typing would be more of a hassle in some situations, i just cant find myself swipe typing
Belle vidéo «   Dommages de pas traduire en français. Les quelque millions de français aurait aimée...😉
Has anyone here ever wasted alot of money buying something stupid  &quot;i📱&quot; then later try to justify it ...
Whos before ios 13
MARK ASS BROWY
Multitask/split screen
Bro..  Any news about iPhone 11?
Too much in rush for official release.
Oh yes can’t wait for this update. Good summary 🔥
<b>SAMSUNG</b><br>Seen that, done that. NEXT!
i have the iphone 8 plus will i get the new wallpapers
Why dark mode not supported for iPhone xr ???
Can’t wait for this! Who else?
The volume bar needs to get a smaller than that. It’s still a bit intrusive.
Please don&#39;t say that you were supporting LGBT, please.
Has the Camera app changed? Are there now Settings to choose or stuff like that?
When will iOS 13 come to Greece
I can’t find the iOS 13 on my 7 plus anyone plz help
I watched this video even if I&#39;m an Android user. I was like, what the hell am I doing?😂
damn!
can somebody explain me about the volume bar update?
For you gamers out there,  iOS 13 will also offer controller support.
You’re dumb.
When did this update come out??? I would like the swipe keyboard and the dark mode...because I have this update 12.3.1
Small youtuber here. Can I have some hugs? 🤗
Funny how people think apple is better than android. Android phones have had these features long long time ago.
Wtf thats it ? 😭
Being an android user why am i even watching it 😂
Can u play fortnite with a controller
How did u download it?
thats all ???
I just want a location shortcut dammit Apple &amp; switch back to the old wifi/bluetooth shortcuts where it actually turns on &amp; off.
the best feature is new photo editing tools as well as video editing tools yahoooo
Depth Control on X?
How about battery life? Does it drain fast?
Your cool
What about ignoring a call without declining it? Did it make the cut for iOS 13?
available on iphone 6s??
Noise reduction in videos is really amazing I hope it will work good
When can I upgrade
Android: Hmm...i have seen this before but where?<br>iOS: Ar.. come on, I also want the same level as you :V <br>Android: Okay, go on............................<br>iOS: Yeah!!!!!<br>Hongmeng OS: Guys, don&#39;t forget about me. I&#39;m new here...<br>Android &amp; iOS: ..............................................
So good
Mark ass brownie
When does iOS 13 come out?
will all the updates apply to iphone XR
Guys I have an iPhone X and the iOS 13 update is not available for me??? What’s up with that
为什么没有画面……
I was freaking waiting for the swiping on keyboard😫
Mark Ass Brownie
Sign in with Apple ID is gonna be huge. In a world with no privacy I appreciate their dedication
Not worth upgrading my phone for 1000 dollars
Should i update ios 13 on my iphone 6s plus
The top two is definitely great ones for me as well. A feature I am dumb struck as to why its not part of the operating system is the ability to filter all mails from a specific sender and delete all of those with one function.
PLEASE LET US ADJUST THE SHUTTER AND APERTURE! ISO etc
IS THERE ANY UPDATE ABOUT DIRECTLY TURNING OFF WIFI AND BLUETOOTH FROM THE CONTROL CENTER W/O HAVING TO TURNING IT OFF IN SETTINGS??????
Intro: Okay okay<br>Marques: Hey what is up guys, MKBHD here<br>Song: Okay Okay
Do your messages background turn dark including keyboard when dark mode is on?
I just wanted the xr to have the 3d touch

If you know you know...<br><br><br><br><br>Mark Ass Brownie
You live in bergan county? In New Jersey
idk why but at one point i remember swipe typing on my 6, it was a long time ago but it was on messages and i didn’t download anything
i hope they do something about phone calls that i don’t want to pick up. they really got me waiting for the call to end so that i can get back to what i was doing 🤦🏽‍♀️
Would this work for poor people like myself that still have an iPhone 8 😟 because I got an update but for IOS 12.3 😥
i have the xr and i don’t have face id, issa bit fishyyy
I updated my phone but it says 12.3.1? Can somebody help me? Haha i really dont have idea about ios updates

Kearny works?? Is your middle name Kearny?
Black ass brownie
That moment when all these features pretty much exist on Android since ages..
What the fuck they just got a dark mode. Waiting so long for not even new but old shit. Fuck you apple. Still paying for this phone though. LIT video tbh
Why did Google have to get rid of expanded menus in the quick settings menu? It was one of my favourite things about Android 7 and they just decided to kill it for no reason &gt;&lt;
Why am I watching this I just switched to Galaxy S10
Omfg where is the split view Apple???????
Lists in maps of places to visit is what I’m most excited for for iOS13.
I still forget that you can’t see the WiFi networks by holding😂
Hah, &quot;I demand a refund&quot; AWESOME
does dark mode available for iphone7??
These all were tweaks
I’m very excited for Bluetooth controller support
Markass Brownie
When is it gonna drop ?
Thank tour very much!
His airpods were black👀 i smell fakes x
I&#39;m looking to upgrade to a new phone and I&#39;m not sure which phone to go to. I was thinking of and Iphone 8 or an S9. because the seem like great phones and a massive upgrade to my current phone. But I love the design of the X. I&#39;m stumped as to which phone to get, can anyone give their insight.
Super nice video!
6-it slows down older devices
Marques, question. Has there ever been any talk of Apple incorporating a feature to work volumes independently of themselves. For example, ringer volume on, text volume off, etc?? Or volumes at different levels for each type? Or has anyone reading this heard? Thanks. <br>As far as the iOS update, I think I will enjoy the media poetion. Since I do take a lot of pictures and videos from my phone. <br><br>Great stuff btw. Long time fan.
For me I like the volume hud one
how do i get the update??
I stg I have a debate with my friend at school every day about why Apple is better than Samsung 🤣🤣🤣 <b>lmao who agrees with me?????</b>
Dark Mode?.. pfft.. just use Color Inversion
Wanna mame your phone look iOS twelvy? Make your phone turn into <b>Bold Text</b>
Wow so no one&#39;s saying how Samsung&#39;s One UI has already got most of these features. Smh, Apple always behind.
You can rotate videos in the photos app in iOS12, you have to press “iMovie” but it keeps you in the photos app
Is this with every iPhone?
Can iPhone 7 use ios 13?
Dark mode 🤣🤣🤣 seriously apple did it in 2019 and it is most anticipated...I cant stop laughing....
LOVE IT! Anyone Else?🤔
When will this iOS update come?
When can we download the ios 13?
Don’t have an Iphone 10 but love the vid. Keep it up.
Oooooooo man captions in Portuguese Brazil!!!! Pleaseeeeee
Has he got black AirPods?
When u r using iPhone in Indian networks very slow data network. But android is better speed 🤭
Woahhh built in color gradinggg 🤯
Is iPhone 8 still getting IOS 13?
did Apple give you that T-shirt? it’s exactly like their plain still wallpapers. 🤔
Still no way to add/edit keywords  in Photos (on iOS)? So odd you can do that on MacOS Photos but not iOS. They probably think titles/comments and AI generated keywords are enough (they aren&#39;t yet)
Will iPhone 6 support iOS 13?  And when exactly is the release date?
Thank you 😊
can someone help me please, my phone still hasnt updated and ive reseted my phone 5 times and it is still not working.
Markass Brownie
around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf1lQdupvPE&amp;t=40">0:40</a> he said for your future iphone? what iphone is coming you must tell us
i fw it
I was really hoping to see multi windows on this update. I guess we have to wait longer
Are these for the newer iphones or for any
Can I lock app in iphone 6 plus with the latest ios updated (ios 13) ?
App locker is available in ios 13?
Class as usual Marques 👌
Funktioniert iOS 13 auf auf iPhone 6?
Sadly I&#39;ve got a iphone 6s

Mark ass brownie ass fudge
Did you ever heard MIUI 10?
Looks like im switching see ya android 👋
🤣🤣🤣 I felt I was in 2010. Apple took  9 years to graduate in &#39;Android&#39;🤣🤣
Does the shared audio only work with AirPods or with any Bluetooth headphones?
Iphone 7plus 13ios why not show in update??
Wait... you can crop videos now... without Videoshop.... love that
What about incoming phone/video call that takes up the WHOLE screen? I thought they made it smaller and in bar manner? Anyone can confirm this?
how about close all open apps? on this and iPad OS?
There is not amazing about iOS 13 andriod has all those features and more  geeze
Yeah man I know that android have this swipe keyboard feature from a decade but who uses the swipe keyboard feature even it&#39;s there because of its uncorrected  predictions it&#39;s better to type straight rather than swipe keyboard.
This comment was written with the swipe typing with an Android
Other Companies: Achieving milestones in all screen displays with camera cutouts, popup cameras and under display cameras.<br><br>Apple: Now while you type, you can swipe.<br><br>Android users: Are we a joke to you?
Wow by far the most news worthy improvement is that they FINALLY redesigned the volume indicator. When you&#39;re watching a video that thing lingers on the screen for what feels like 10,000 years
When will it be available??
it would be great for iOS 14 to be, that the incoming call doesnt cover the whole screen and u can just put it in ur corner of ur phone while doing smth else
If you get the beta will it automatically update to the next update or give you the option or will you have to do the whole installation process over again
I like apple get your Android on Apple
So the best thing is dark mode<br>Dude! Seriously?
Wait so how do I download it early ?
<b><i>But I’m an iphone 6 user</i></b>
mark ass brownie
The worst thing is that... my iPhone 5s won’t get it. 😭😭
Dark mode. Finally. Sweet.
Dark mode will applicable for YouTube,insta,what&#39;s app ?
Just saying... Muse.. Yes! 🤘🏻
Make a video about future of MacOS and what apple paln to do with ipadOS
Marques, what is the brand/model of the mouse that you have on your desk?
Just give us the F*cking messenger Chat heads

My favourite is the volume one
Happy for volume button finally....
Does anyone else hate the XS camera.   :( I was hoping they’d fix it but they didn’t
Who else didnt get the update :(
Still no multitasking feature. Sigh.
Who saw Origin Of Symmetry?
iPhone : Installs the update.<br>Android : Installs the app!
Hi! Will there be any improvments in maps in ios 13?
When iOS 13 available in Pakistan 🇵🇰 ?
Apple got yall trapped.

I love that your video is super direct to the point. Thank you!
What is the difference between dark mode and invert colours (under display accomodations) ?
Boy you fine! Haha oh also great video too! 😂

So still no VPN toggle in a CC? Amazing
So still no VPN toggle in a CC? Amazing
Video rotation for me🙌🏼🙌🏼

Hm, i’m the Iphone X user. But this is you called as update ? Android did it since the dinosaurs died 😌
Yes IOS 13 is gonna be the best IOS in a long time.
Can&#39;t wait to try this iOS 13 on my iPhone
Not being hateful but my redmi 5 plus, which is an Android had the miui that sets the volume control right next to the buttons almost over a year now... And... The wifi setting from control panel? Android had that on notification panel since 2016/2017? IOS is a great UI system but idk man, Android seems to listen to their user more 😂
Last 10 days my iphone 8 plus down its battery health 94% to 91% what was the problem charger or mobile

The old volume one looks like something from 1988 on a Nokia phone lmao
