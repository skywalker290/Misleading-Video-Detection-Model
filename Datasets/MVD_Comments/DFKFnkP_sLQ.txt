Where can you get these wallpaper t v&#39;s
Ur intros have been 🔥🔥🔥for years and this is no exception 😊
I’m surprised they didn’t run with this idea and make this more accessible and cheaper. I believe TVs like this are the future of TVs. I think they’ll even be thinner and will be able to be bought in any size to accommodate any wall. Imagine being able to be connect multiple TVs and have whatever you are watching follow you like in the Chris Rock movie “Down to Earth” 😆
I wallpapered my entire house with this product, it only cost 4 million dollars.
where can i order it
I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5) <br>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. (Isaiah 64:6)<br>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. (Romans 3:10-12)
🥰😍💟💚🤍👏👌👍
Have been using my LG OLED65WX9LA everyday for 7 months now, and im still amazed as the 1st time i layed my eyes on this screen. Was lucky to snag it for 2250eur from a midnight birthday sale😀
How much is this tv today ?  A quick good search and i cant find it anywhere.  And did this tech hold up?
I thought you were white my god 🤦🏽‍♂️
It&#39;s just $3000 now. Totally affordable.
Does this panel strong enough to stand a flying toys like my SAMSUNG SMART TV that I used for 1 month and cracked due tu I accidently bumped the remote to the panel and yup... it cracked so I buy the new SAMSUNG SMART TV (CURVED) one then yup another shit happens my son toys fly through the TV and decided to buy a cheap TV (TOSHIBA) and fuck I buy the TV (TOSHIBA) 5 years ago nothing happened till now?!?!?!?!?!??! 🥲
🥰😍🤩👌👍👏
Hey how was it make it look like nothing no cable right and stuff 🙂 now give out for free world is going through a virgin virus
&quot;DISCONTINUED&quot;
65” open-box for €3K. Hmm... still, I’ve nowhere to put that sound bar. I think I prefer an AIO setup tbh.
Okay so this may be a silly question in some peoples opinion. But I couldnt help to see it has optical audio sound out. <br>Is there a way to connect a wireless soundbar to this and just hide the soundbar that comes with it? Preferably I wouldnt want anything to be seen other than the screen on the wall and I&#39;ll just put the soundbar somewhere else hidden in the room or.. something. Just dont like the idea of the bar being right below it.
Name of game plzz??

Or you could flush mount a regular tv in a wall. I could probably flush mount a standard oled just as fast as hanging one of these.

Nope&#39; I don&#39;t know who has told you 1000 nits of brightness?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=100">1:40</a><br>It&#39;s more like 800nits of peak scene HDR brightness but that is still very impressive when your rolling with that contrast and black control on an pixel-level and they actually toned it down a nudge since the 2017 lineup to prevent perm. retention.<br>same with response rates that also peaked in the 2017 line. with something like 0.1ms 80% and 0.2ms 100% (source Rtings) and also been toned down to circumvent stutter on low frame content..<br>also recall the 2017 LG OLED line where the last series that had high bandwidth user-interface with USB3, - later years only have USB2 and can be con hence high-bitrate-content and being able to drive fx a harddrive, where USB often cant supply enough power and you need to piggyback ride with an extra Y power cable.
Instead of that cable it should have a Bluetooth connection for that sound bar !!
This my tv! I got it for 5000 plus tax cause it was store model. Love it
Whats the intro song?
I want it.
Coooll
marques you look 5 years younger 😁
Damn you sound like a white boy LOL
Ramapada   sang
Does the sound bar come with the TV or is it sold separately
Im watching this in November 2020. Is it just me or anyone else thinks that Marques&#39; pitch in hus voice in this video and the excitement seems a little bit too high than usual?? Now I know, this TV is no joke and is one of a kind.. but.. still..??
I actually bought this and 2yrs in its still fucking unreal ahah
TV&#39;s in 2020 still have to catch up
Wait this Tv has a magnet that can literally stick to an ordinary normal wall or is it a little more complicated than that?🤔
What are your thoughts on the samsung frame?
What is the game that u played in this video
Great Video ,
Why so high up on the wall?
At that price, a laser projector might be a better deal if thinness is that important. Then you can put wireless sound equipment wherever you want and don&#39;t have to worry about hiding the ribbon cable.
This is the TV I want when I finally get my PS5 I&#39;m gonna do a whole update on my system I don&#39;t even care how much it&#39;s going to cost I will be the king
PLZ make a video about the sero TV by samsung
That&#39;s not Wallpaper that s a TV on the wall?
Youre the best and least annoying at this.
I want to buy a picture frame to put around it
Marques can you please show how you mounted this to the wall? Thank you.
I HATE YOUTUBE ADS!!!!!
the intro music is amazing
Hey dude, did you go to school? You plug a tv into a power socket not a wall, and the only dope is you
Wow amazing so cool...
Wow the cable is so flat and flexible it’s wonderful
Wow it really look like part of the wall
i wish that i can play your frisbee game
Would love to have this inserted into a wall with a bling and everything, would look amazing.
Your eyes can barely detect 2K resolution, never mind 8K. This is like having &quot;Quadrophic sound&quot; instead of stereo. All hype, no improvement in performance.
HI, I respect your reviews and the information you share.  What is your <br>take on my options at a local store on these LGs? OLED65W7P for $1800 vs<br> OLED65C9PUA $2000
And has the same picture quality like C9 model, which is the best buy at the moment!
It looks really good but right now its just too damn expensive to justify the outlay, OLED is still way too pricey, you could get an LCD tv for a fraction of the cost maybe with not as good black levels but good enough, and the real bonus being that you don&#39;t get screen burn in which is the bane of OLED screens
You&#39;re the man Marques
Dude, you&#39;re really amateur! You don&#39;t know how to hide a cable behind a wall? You can watch a YouTube video and learn in 5 minutes!
22 November 2019. And the price of the 4K TV is 2K
Why 65&quot;? Why not 70&quot;?
How is it holding after 2+ years?
Pls do a video on Samsung tabs and iPads
I really like LG.
there were once ancient   civilizations before then they reached their most advanced stage and suddenly disappeared, im sure the current civilization is nearing an end too, cro magnons will soon roam the earth to start new civilizations and earth will be known by another name
NOTE: The soundbar does not sound good for a 8000 dollar tv.. i recomend getting other atmos speakers for this tv
Can u buy that sound bar separate asking for a friend🤷🏼‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=227">3:47</a> You lucky boy
Guys this is a discontinued product...
Not as thin as my wallet..
Saw this in my lg c8 oled tv
I have to say this TV is not beautiful
It would be really cool if you hid that cable!!
great now i have to figure out where to put the sound bar .. thanks LG .....
beautiful TV too expensive I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth that much especially with technology on TVs everyday change
8k qled
Stupid humans
In India its 45000usd lol
Odd question since it has nothing to do with the TV, but what focal length of lens are you using at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=287">4:47</a>?
So no one gonna talk about that green shell snipe?
Imagine it in 8k
On sale for $4499 at Wal-Mart right now. Not a good sign.
if your wall is flat, your tv will be flat.
Didn&#39;t this thing fall off the wall ?
I need money
I&#39;m glad, I watched this video on my 2K monitor and on my 720P TV.  It&#39;s definitely worth seeing in higher details. The work you did to get the video to be so crisp with that tight focus was amazing for me to see. Good work, Marques.
m
Waw luarbiasa sekali. Ini siapa penemunya?
This is mind blowing, this is my definition of art. It’s expensive rn, after Samsung and other brands start to make their own models it’ll be more affordable.
Nah, not thin enough. Made a hole on the wall so its actually in the wall, completely flat. Then put a thin later of glass over the entire wall, clear where the TV is dark (black?) every where else. So when its off its just a plain semi-gloss wall. <br>Oh, you could buy those fake thin walls. And put them around and bellow the TV. To cover the ribbon if you don&#39;t want to break your real wall.
Is it good for gaming?
real dope tech is the Red Weapon
Wow, this is already 1.5 yrs old. I wonder how much it is now?
UNBOX THERAPY HAD IT FIRST
I&#39;m buying one on blackfriday 2025.
Intro misic2?
Hi Marques I love your videos
So how does it handle heat displacement?
MARK ASS!
I just want an $8K window that I can put anything on.
Its so thin it looks like a CGI tv in this video
So it&#39;s really thin but it&#39;s is slaved to a unit the size of like 5 bricks.  What if I already have a kick ass stereo?  This would be awesome if the designers provided a console size master unit rather than this stylized giant freaking monstrosity of an anchor.
amazing
Samsung miles better
1000 nits on an OLED? can you show me how you tested that?
Why is your TV installed so high up on the wall ? Do you even realise what kind of neck pain you will get for viewing movie from a TV installed at that high up on the wall.<br><br>Ideal viewing height should be your sitting height.<br><br>You also didn’t need a long connecting cable in the ideal scenario. Just install it at viewing height equal to your sitting height. Rest all is sorted.
👍👍😊
Only losers use smart steering
Gotta dope subwoofer to connect up to?
Watching this a year later in 480p!
Congratulations for 7M Marques
CANT WAIT to get this marques
Nice tv but how many movies are being filmed in 4K?
It’s a picture that moves
Show us playing games on it
My mind just keeps thinking it’s photoshopped I can’t wrap my head around it
That screen and sound bar is simple SICK 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️
imgine your heart if it falls
Burn in yet?
For me the selling point of this tv is the fact that all the I/O is in the sound bar making cable management so much easier. I have a gaming setup with a lot of consoles and a ton of cables to worry about so if I could have only one wire going up to my tv then I’d have a much easier time keeping the cable mess hidden down and behind the stands where I keep my consoles
What if you have surround sound spealers, proper ones.
really cool piece of tech, but that cable coming down the wall just ruins it for me. Definitely would opt to install it inside a wall.
What&#39;s the game name ur playing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=224">3:44</a>
And  I&#39;m watching this video in 144p
Dont buy oled tv... Burn in problem in expensive oled... Dont waste ur money
I have one of these but in b7 form.
I wonder what&#39;s the longevity of this tv/tech.<br>I read that Samsung uses inferior components in their TV&#39;s. <br>That&#39;s why my Samsung went to crap in about less than 8yrs.
I think it’ll look much better on a black wall.
Such a cumbersome TV. WAYY too thick I only buy TVs thinner than the actresses I watch on it.
Why don&#39;t they do this for computer monitors?
Just drill a hole put a fat tv and boom you got wallpaper tv
$8k is not unreasonable for that tv. I’ll consider an 85” when it’s available.
yo mama so thin, she needs a soundbar to speak
Birb
This is how all 📺 should be. Oled or microled.
&quot;Video is bae!&quot; Love that. Where can I get one?
I just think how a single man can get probably infinity money...and how awesome or boring it could be....
what are those games he is playing
WOW
Wow!!!
👍
Talk you guys to the next one, peace!
Update: It’s broken and no one will ever know how because of Nest.
Very good
Add me on your Nintendo switch
Wait? Does the SoundBar come with the TV?
I literally got aroused when I saw it&#39;s side view...................
I was amazed with this TV... Until I heard the price..
WTF... $8000 damn that the most expensive wallpaper ever
Hey Marques, what about making a new video about this screen after one year use
Should I be worried about burn in when I game using this TV?
OMG it&#39;s so thin that it looks like it was edited in the video
Just buy a projector
Does the soundbar come separately?? Or with the TV itself.
Fuck it, so big so thin
Now harry potter talking potraits can be real
God Of War on this ... 😍
8,000 <br><br><br><br><br><br>Fuck that I don&#39;t even have $80
RIP
Aaaaand it&#39;s broken☹️☹️☹️
Who came here from his tweet? RIP TV
So sad that the Tv fell and broke <br>RIP WALLPAPER tv <br>2K17-2K18
Anyone after InstaLife ?
I can&#39;t believe that this guy can make his videos so good
Ummm..... projectors.....
Why high-end 4k OLED TVs do not offer all colors of <b>100%</b> DCI color space or adobe color space?  Is it 100% color space saved for 8K TVs?  🤑😍😎
Wait for China
I want it even tho I have a 4K tv hahah😝😝😝
Never really understood the awkward gawking shots of Marques just staring at whatever he’s reviewing.
Nice introduction
The 4k tv that cost 8k
Pretty cool tv Marques. What is the name of the opening music?
Now just imagine playing dance central on this TV
oohhhm ma GOD 8000$
Wow!!!
How does it get power?
@MarquesBrownlee hy man what do you think about this oled x 4 Display as Gaming....???
ow much lg paid you for this commercial?
make one video on  mi tv full revive
What model soundbar
really good commerical
This review is so good. It has exactly all I needed to know. Thanks!
I just got motivated to slave over some overtime. !
Cool! Its looking like Invisble
Can&#39;t you just get a regular 4K TV and put it in a wall?
Please review the Mi TV 4.
Why not have it installed in the wall, as part of the wall that is??
Well I&#39;m not spending any money on something that can burn in for no reason from one day to another
So when did they start pronouncing L.E.D. Lead?
Which car is it? at the beginning of the video...
Shame that the content cannot equal the hardware.
i&#39;ll still take a projector over this tv.
This tv don have speaker?
DOES MY CRT MONITOR CAN COMPETE THIS TV????
Crazy to think that in 10 years, this TV will be old and outdated. Technology is crazy 0_o
In India OLED 77W7T costs about 30 lakh rupees i.e $47000
I find it ironic that a video about a 4K tv has 4K comments
I work on these. They are awesome in person
Wow!<br>What a nice experience we will feel after using it. Really it looks like a wallpaper on the wall.
I’ll be excited when I see this in Costco.
A 100inch 8k display has a 100ppi. My phone has 441 and it is 1080p. It does not matter if a tv is 8k because the only technology involved is to put A LOT of pixels on a display, but relatevely far from each other. Wake me up when a 400ppi 55inch tv comes out, that sh!it would have a 64k resolution :))))) <b>God I love math</b>
So this is actually a monitor technically
I thought it was a green screen poster😂😂
I&#39;m just mesmerized
Wow display is thinner than a phone witch has a display a battery a camera a bunch of other stuff
I just looked at it and the 77 inch one is $40000 Australian dollars
might as well get a nice projector! and spend half the price
Video is bae...
I hear that oled tv&#39;s have burn in issues, is it true?
My question is when will they be able to make that wireless?
I can’t wait for this thing to become more affordable for someone like me!!!!!
The ugly wire ruins it. Needs to be hidden inside the wall.
Love to watch porn at ..this tv..
How does retro consoles look on this tv throught the XRGB Mini Framemeister if you know what that is and how does Xbox 360 PS3 Wii U PS4 Pro and Xbox One X  looks on this tv
holy fuck, that bezels are so thin...
lmao like im gonna buy a 8k tv
I returned the Samsung 55MU9000 and replaced it for lg oled 55b7,. Oled has a better contrast , better black colors ,cleaner and more natural pictures, a better viewing angle .qled  is the trash from the TV
I HATE lg remote😐 ill still take it for the beautiful screen
whats the input lag on this TV???!?!?!
How can you connect PS4 with this TV? Cuz I just bought the same one a week ago?
Looks really good in a white wall
I left the video the second he said it&#39;s for 8000$ :&quot;DDD
I&#39;m watching this from a LG W7.
What tv stand is that I wanna buy one
Maybe someone can help me understand.<br>I get that the TV is flashy and expensive but why not price it in the lower $1000-2000 range where it’s more affordable, wouldn’t that convince more people to buy it or is that too much of a risk for the company?<br><br>Price high and don’t sell as much<br>Price low and sell more, isn’t that how business works?
Love me OLED and watchin cardoons with me kids.
wtf? 8k and and was to difficult for them to make the speaker wireless? That cable is just ugly as fuck and looks ridiculous.
gets copy striked because of mario kart lol
I wish it came in a 55&quot; version :(
Wow!!
What interface is this white cable?
Just get the B7A. Same exact picture and save yourself 6k.
WOW how slim it is •_•
best way to hide the cable without running it down the wall..use a floating shelf like the OmniMount Tria shelf to hold the soundbar (sucks soundbar isn&#39;t wall mountable), the mount has a cable channel to hide the cable. I get that part of the appeal is to have the super thin tv and nothing else on the wall, but that cable kills it as much if not more that a floating shelf for me
amazing
You can buy 50 iPhone X for the cost of that TV!! 😎😂
Its not purchases by middle classe family plz tell me some midd range product or phone in 20000 thousand in Indian rupee
Can&#39;t wait to get this
Dude you are the man!  Thanks for sharing
Could you please make a video on budget gaming laptop laptop ??
Wall paper TV! WOW. I am excited about that. I&#39;m 60 years old and I&#39;m jumping out of my seat. I want one  but, I can see some disadvantages of the design too. It looks good on paper or a video. I would have to see one in person.  Mounting this flush on the wall with no ability to adjust the tilt isn&#39;t that exciting. I think we all have experienced that. I foresee someone  changing that so you can adjust the tilt. Separating the head unit from the monitor is a great idea. It might even drive down manufacturing cost. More great ideas like that would help and are fine as long as you can give people options. I think there should be head available with no sound and no tuner. Cable it up to a surround sound system and other external equipment for your options. That could make it even cheaper.  Also that ribbon cable should have color options too.
Black tv....pitch white walls....*facepalm* REKT
I jave an LG G6
cool:)
superb!
Tip to the company.... put a touchscreen option that you can turn off and on..
am i the only one that still has a box tv?
Dope review. Thanks!
Nicest tv I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life. I love the future but I wish I was rich, that&#39;s for sure🙃
OH. MY. SWEET. JESUS
All they have done is scaled up the technical solutions inside a 486 IBM thinkpad
Wow beautiful tv tooo much tho but lobe the tee shirt bruha
I wonder if it is less to produce !!! 100% agree with the design !!!
Yes it&#39;s quite an amazing TV I absolutely love it. But for now I&#39;m trying to get a 65 inch AMOLED 3D 4K from LG since I keep on buying Blu-ray 3D movies from amazon UK &amp; for now I have to make do with a 55 inch LG Back lit super LED TV set with the passive 3D technology that&#39;s brilliant but I don&#39;t like the back lit LED colour bleeding, the picture still very good but no wear near as good as an AMOLED display panel. I have just sign a petition to LG electronics to revive an OLED 3D display panel TV for 2018 anyway thanks and peace
Why don&#39;t you use the word &quot;of&quot;?<br><br>Pet peeve, but I&#39;ve never heard you say the word &quot;of&quot; in regard to &quot;out of the box&quot; &quot;out of the bottom of the device&quot;.
LG oled is the future
wow! Great! i WISH I HAD ONE.
how did he mount it to the wall so close
I thought I could buy this then he said it costs $8000 and I damn near had a heart attack
Tiene muy buen contraste pero la imagen para mi gusto un poco oscurita.
I want that introduction music 🎶
Now just imagine if you could add a lot more in your bedroom and add a screen saver or some trippy shit. You will have the dopest bedroom ever.
Actually I think it was MI Tv who started it making only the panel and controls out in a separate box
Can it cook nuggets?
swedish coin
I dont know why in hell it cost so much money just getting paper thin screen $8,000 plus taxes
All that and the sound bar /TV connection ribbon cable couldn&#39;t be Bluetooth wirrless
TV is just amazing. Im so sick of black people stero-types... look at this dude. Just a normal person
Hey, whattaizup&#39; guys? I&#39;m MKBHD here and...
he does not sound like a typical black guy
The most drool worthy tv design in a long time.
Is OLED susceptible to burn-in? Just curious
Crispy AF
Why not just cut an inch thick indent in the wall and place any old 4k tv in it, so it sticks out of the wall by 0 mm?
how about a drop test?
just a get a projector?
A black dude doing tech reviews with 5m subs !!! Salute !
Anyone has the name of the intro song?
It should be named Harry Potter OLED TV hahahaha. get my point? :) :)
which is this game he played
Time to do a giveaway!!!!
Xbox one x +this TV =😍😍
Impressive
Ever so weirdly ended up watching dis video after the OLED tv rant vid Marques  made 5 years back!!! dis guy is inspiration. ❤️
I never look at my Samsung and think. ..... my tv is too thick? <br>This tv limits where and how you mount your tv. Also there are those comms cables underneath. <br>Check out the new Sammy tv on the market. <br>Don&#39;t get me wrong.  The tv is very thin but not without flaws.<br>👊💥🍻
The price is frightening
its everything but 4k. exactly not to mention they brand there TVs as 4k when they are not even true 4k native resolution which is 4096×2160 while they sell people TVs that are  less than 4k at 3840×2160. My question is how the corporations/companies are allowed to brand something that it is not and sell it to people? They are literally scamming buyers.
Get this tv to play low res mario kart.
I wish i was a tech youtuber. beautiful.
Do you have to buy it without the soundbar? Could you buy it with just the tech needed to run the screen?
So I could plug my ps4 into that tv
I want to know what the inside of the sound bar looks like
whats the price ?
Now, countersink it into the wall itself to make it completely flush
Give it a couple years...it will be $499.99 in your local Black Friday ad.
I can buy  a car with this TV prize
You mount it to a wood board stand and tada, presto. Although, thus, defeating its purpose.
8000$ 🎅 santa give me 1 😉😄
it will be cheap in 20 years
Buy a fucking projector save the money
Baby where&#39;s the car?.... So do you like the new tv😂
8k?fuuuckkk daaaat!
Or you could watch YouTube videos DIY without having to pay extra for an electrician to get it up to code hiding the cable within the dry wall.  For something simple like hiding the cable within the wall, the electrician usually look at a grown man as if you&#39;re an idiot.  It makes an educated, grown man lower than the electrician&#39;s sweaty balls, if you get the drift, especially when the grown man is a minority.  That&#39;s how it is in America.  Employers pay you a quarter less than the majority if you&#39;re a minority man, because they know that you&#39;re inferior.  How to be inferior?  Calling an electrician to do something basic when you can be a man about it and do it yourself.
i need 8k
This is pointless Nobody watches TV
I wonder how you hook up a PS4
this TV need a black wall so its more MAGIC
in India its almost 20k
man i wish i was rich
You Unbox Therapy and Linus Tech Tips should do a give a way on this tv and soundbar
I&#39;d hide the chord in the wall
You should call it cool tech!
7k dollars t.v. 😂😂 hell yea now I can buy this after 10years😂😂😂
Intro music track name?
$6999 wtf
The speakers that go up they definitely project sound so it sounds more like 360
I have a CRT TV
MKBHD is the best Tech YouTuber ever
Why is everything getting thinner? <br>Literally everything.. <del>btw don’t read my name</del>
Thank you! Thank was great.  Informative, entertaining and professional.  I am SO tired of all of these people making videos with 30 camera cuts and zooms per second/to the beat of the music etc.  Yours was so well done, I don&#39;t even remember if you had used any of those techniques.  Bravo!
I dare you to watch this a playback speed X.5
LG❤
Money&#39;s can buy anything! If i am ! What not! But,waste moneys for this ! Toshiba 8k tv are coming soon! So
amazing looking tv. please cut a channel in your wall for the cable so the plastic box channel can be thrown out.
You should paint the bezels the same color as your wall
I&#39;m gonna buy this after 10 years
i wish if i can offer 8k $ to buy it :) how lucky u r ;)
Please Do a review on Nokia 8.
Thin like my hair line
Too thin, you can&#39;t swivel it. It&#39;s on the wall, who cares if it&#39;s thin.
I just made the likes go from 68K to 69K
Etcetera...
You living young man
Shit 8k is too much. Wait until it drops to like 1.5k
Properly shielded and up to code? Wow were you paid to say that? It is not hard to find the dead space of a wall and cut 2 holes; drop the cable down then plug it in. <br>And where do you live that the inside of your walls are more electronically noisy than the open air outside the wall?
Am I the only one thinking 7 grand is not bad for such an amazing tv?
This is just borrowed for review purposes right? They didn&#39;t give it to him for free right? Pls calm me down
I&#39;ve seen so much of Elon Musk and his projects in this TV.  That&#39;s a cool TV by the way.
could they not replace the ribbon cable with a wireless or bluetooth connection? I mean, its impressive, but that cable running out the bottom just takes away the full potential of how amazing it would look if it was just a giant flat rectangle on a plain white wall.
8000 dollars!!!! Wow...It&#39;s pretty but man that&#39;s expensive
The price is ridiculously high but of course they will drop down to like 1500  in a year or two after they don&#39;t sell
7 thousand dollar tv....
This is so dope , we going be like Star Trek lol in like 3 more years if LG bringing this kind of Heat
never really followed tvs but this is amazing
Just noticed something... 5 million  subscribers! 😱 He&#39;s killing it
now i can say i am living in 2017. first futuristic tech
Wow. Now only if LG can make a phone like this. Major keys
This exact one he has is $11,000USD lol
It&#39;s $6999.99 now . Somebody go grab one lol
The best tv I have ever seen. Absolutely gorgeous.
This is fucking insane. Thanks LG, for reminding me that even with $10k worth of tech, people can still feel poor.
If a kid was to pull the cable will the TV fall off the wall?
It&#39;s funny because I&#39;m watching this video through my phone and the comments also say 4K.
Watching 4k porn on this tv will be amazing.
In 5 years it will be under $1000
besides youtube reviews wt else do you do?
Why do you do a voice over ? Why don&#39;t you just talk instead of standing there. It makes you look somewhat childish
holy crap, LG and Sony tvs are just blowing my mind with their innovations, imma be on the watch for when this is on sale lol
Cool guy points lost due to having &quot;bae&quot; on a shirt.
Bruh u play as lakitu in mariokart
My parents just got this tv, I wish they used the money to build my gaming setup. :cri but the resolution is great on this tv even though Im not gonna watch tv
80 inch 8k hdr oled 800 bucks. Thats where it&#39;s at till then not buying, my crt is working g8.
damn the price of a down payment for a car!!
imagine some dickhead cutting that cable!!!!!
Watching tv like a BAWS
I think that ribbon can be gone when implementing the new wireless AD in that TV to communicate to its hub. I am sure this is a marketing strategy so that people who bought this model upgrade to the ribbonless  in the future.
&quot;Most people aren&#39;t ever going to buy this&quot; - remember where you were when you said that in 4 years when they&#39;re 90% of the new sales market and down around the $1000 mark. A 65&quot; 4k TV cost that in 2014.
Actually I can see this as being the future of TV&#39;s if they keep getting thinner. You will have to wall mount them. In the distant future....maybe around the start of the year 2100 you might have wall paper that can actually be a TV
The speakers are covered from dust.
Wow! This is definitely awesome! I have a question for you though, I&#39;m shopping for a new TV, I have around 1000usd to spend, what would you recommend?
This is the technological power of Korea.
This my main man, he keep me up to date, thanks bro
It will be 500 in a few years. Definitely over price.  They trying to cut necks
Could it do a split screen (into 4 screen) like the LG 43&quot; monitor?
I just read a lot of really bad review  on google!
READ ME!!👨‍🎤🔊🔊🎙📣 why don&#39;t you make a hole in the wall where it just barley has space to wiggle the tv in there and then the wire could feed behind the wall?
You can just poke holes in the wall and feed the cable through.  No need for a professional if you&#39;re a semi able person.  Check for studs, fire blocking, and of course electrical lines first.
Except there&#39;s a giant module at he bottom... I&#39;ll take a slightly thicker regular TV
Its great that its an OLED but the soundbar is the brains which means that if you have your own audio system you have to connect everytbing into the soundbar which is a let down. The flat cable is not in wall rated and the tv cost 8k. You can get a 65 inch sony oled with a better processor and get better audio system and you would be saving about 2k. Just saying.
4k my ass! It&#39;s still 3840 x 2160. If its true 4k (16:9 aspect ration) it should be 4096 x 2304 pixels!
Could use  the strip along side a wall sticker..would make the strip blend in..
LG&#39;s TV with OLED are crazy good and they have been the leaders by far for years, and now the LG v30 and possibly some iPhone Edition will get some of that special LG OLED sauce.
Lg gives you a 8000 $ tv and you call it dope tech. Lg is gonna be pisssed man so pissed
he is so handsome
Only OLED though damn but holy heck does it look good!
$8000 now but couple hundred in 5 years time.
looks great but I feel like for this price the bezel should be thinner
No space for backlight!
We have an lg oled 4k tv amazing display lg is the best
Awesome TV
the tv cable is thicker than the screen.
This thing is thinner than my phone....
It&#39;s $8000 for now give it a year or so and it will just be $2000 or less. Just like every other piece of new tech that comes out its very expensive at first then drops in price.
how do the fuck this fit a hdmi cable
Omg i am gonna buy it immediately...<br><br><br><br><br> i mean that white flat power cable.. really really sturdy cable.. doesn&#39;t flex very much.. 😄😄😄
A 4K TV for $46,500 USD in India? Worth it!
People with the $ to get this also have $$ invested in a sound setup and aren&#39;t interested in a sound bar
Like for Elon Musk
Thats a great TV but let be for real.  $8k is out of most consumers range.  This is a rich mans toy..
Wallpaper TV ki kimat Kitni Hai Jara Bataye
This is the future. I&#39;ll buy it in 3 years at least at half the price...
I wish they did monitors like this. No bezel. I would be ultimate
This TV would be better and cheaper if it had one connect box like Samsung TVs no one needs the speaker and thousands $$$ since anyone buying this TV  would pair it with third party decent surround sound system!!!
0/10 not thin enough. Would not purchase.
I wish you would do more tv reviews
Why are condom commercials playing on your videos mate? ;)
They cost $2000
WTF<br><br>Well<br>That&#39;s<br>Fantastic
FUUUUUUTUUUUURRRREEE!!!
Seems like Marques likes cars a lot.<br>I like that
To me it looks more like a super thin Photo frame stuck on the wall with a vivid coloured wallpaper...
It&#39;s now down to $7000 !!!!
Nah I stick to my 80 inch Vizio 3d with tablets remote control
Who needs tv if you have galaxy 8
Wow this is awesome wow
You have BUG EYES!!!
I&#39;m not super into TVs but this one makes me pumped for the future. I now refuse to upgrade until this style becomes affordable for me. This is my next TV.
it&#39;s so thin that i don&#39;t want it<br>it looks kinda weird lol
the price is fat enough to compensate for thinness.
Mkbhd watches at this TV like a world
Does that mean you can’t use this tv unless you have the proper soundbar
If that was on a black wall, at night ughhhhaaaaa
If you would have mounted on a black background it would be dope
korean tech so amazing
MKBHD doesn&#39;t look like MKBHD from side ways.
mario game name ??
game name ?
Good video. Bad Mario Kart skills. 😂.
Wow
No Scat ??
Does it flex in the mounting process tho?
if you want to hide the Cale in the wall why don&#39;t yo just get a normal 4k tv and struck that in the wall except the screen and a suround sound set up and it will still be cheaper right?
Can you actually use it as a computer screen?
Can you tell me how wide the connector at the ENDS of the cable are? Will it fit into 2&quot; conduit? I&#39;m trying to plan an install that meets code.
NO.
That is amazing!
But is the TV......🅱ONELESS
I really appreciate your dedication to uploading at 4k, it really is beautiful especially if you can watch it in 2017 like me
Will it blend?
Expensive now, but in a few short years OLED will be just a few hundred bucks.
It&#39;s on sale now huh?
I will buy it don&#39;t care about that price
i will get things like these, one day
Some of the shots make the screen look really reflective. Does it have any protection against glare?
i would put that in a wall with black piano finish. When off, you wouldnt see the tv, and when u had to turn it on, BUM!
Why don&#39;t you just drill a hole in the wall and put a 2000 dollar tv ???? Save 6000 bruh
No DisplayPort? Thanks
I don&#39;t understand why reviewers test out the TV with Nintendo switch when you can do it with ps4 pro. lol
like damnn this is so dope. the only downside is the cable! they need to do some wireless connection.
Intro song anyone?
Next yr i will buy it on 50% discount
Your videos are always very well done.
That means &quot;TV are NOT small as 2 SD card&quot;. The display  are thin as 2 SD card. They TV are still huge. It&#39;s a separate box.
how uninstall this TV?
I have a 65 inch lg 4k smart tv and it only cost 1,400 US that is about a 6,500 difference for it to be thin. Not worth it
This is from between $6,000 - $16,000
is it boneless?
now color match the thin bezel with your wall lol
Jesus Christ this tv is DOPE
wtf. for last 3 days whenever i go to youtube i ALWAYS (not figuratively) see a spider. i dont get this. film theory had 2 videos full of huge spider photos so i couldnt watch it. i watched a savage video which had a spider in it. a newly released unbox theapy video had spiders in it. i mean come on. its unbox therapy. the channel you expect the least to see scary thing in the nature. i watched so many things that was recommended by youtube. and most of them have spiders. by the way the videos that i was talking about earlier were also recommended to me by google. my conspiracy theory is that they are either trying to make me less scared of spiders. or they are just fucking with me. seriously how did i see a spider in a fucking tv review. i can believe this. it is intentional. every time i go into youtube im scared that i will see a fucking goat spider. srsly im.tired of this youtube. stop. (i know this sounds stupid but its really crazy.)
What have you mounted the tv so high?
can I win&#39;t it pls I need that
I love your job mayn<br>eget to touch all new technology
TV is sexy again.
someone should have a WHOLE room with this, so it&#39;s like literally wallpaper
Shut up and take my money!<br><br>Wait, I&#39;m an engineer. 😭
At that fucking price it better make me fucking sandwiches
that nintendo switch tho &lt;3
Give it 10 years and it will be mainstream
you sound not as you look
Thumbs Up for Elon Musk!
Hahah &quot; you can colour me impressed&quot;
do you wanna sell it???
Good. I&#39;m going to buy this in year 2048.
Lol i just wanted to watch you play mario cart
I own a new LG OLED model and the top part of the TV has the same thickness as the one on the video. The lower part of the tv is about 8cm thick or so. Not a big deal. It has the same resolution (as I have heard) with all other LG OLED models. Not worth 8.000€ in my opinion. Extremely impressive of course though.

what does he say? Exidera? I am not a native English speaker :D
downside of it is that u cant move it at different angle
Just watched this video and soldierknowsbest. both wearing the same shirt. dope
I have 8k to blow on it, but Im not stupid. At some point if or when this is released give it a few years and like all tech it&#39;ll go down in price significantly
how many kidney&#39;s do i need again?(to buy this)
This is clean asf
DAYUMMMMMMM
Get a drywall hanger to come in there and replace some of the drywall or you can do it yourself if you&#39;re good at that sort of thing and then the ribbon could just go out the back down the drywall of course behind the piece of drywall and then come back out into the sound bar and then no more unsightly ribbon.
This tech is old<br>Remember the 2012 ces where Samsung had showcased foldable display
Ok I understand it&#39;s only 701 people at the moment....but who are the 701 people that disliked this video? Seriously? maybe it&#39;s 701 people that are butt hurt they can&#39;t afford it or something. I can&#39;t afford it either but I&#39;m not going to dislike the video.
i know i can&#39;t afford it 😂 so i just gonna give you some FYI that W (double U) is spelled &quot;whe&quot; like &quot;when&quot; without n in Indonesia, so it just more efficient i think 😂
what&#39;s the price ???
Man that voice &lt;3
In ten years, TVs like this one will probably cost under a thousand dollar.
couldn&#39;t they connect to the bar with Bluetooth
Are all the YouTube getting this for free? Ijustine got it too
Good God! Ok, so if I win the lotto.....easily this is going to be my daily driver.<br>Great review +Marques Brownlee
3.8mm thick including wallmount - that doesnt sount right.
Wow, I&#39;m getting hard just watching that TV and no porn is even on it. :)<br>I&#39;m a minimalist so a TV like this is sexy as heck. Too bad I can&#39;t afford it at $8000. :)
The Best Tinest Oled Tv Is a Projector And Wireless HAhaha!!
i need this
watching it on 144p
input lag in game mode?
why do people not get that youre supposed to sit close to the tv so that its a cinema-like experience :(
$8000 ?.. no thanks, still amazing though.
I&#39;m not that shocked at how thin it is. It&#39;s just a large display screen. Imagine a laptop LCD screen and having the cables fed into something else. <br><br>Cost is way to high for this sort of tech.
I got one, great tv
Not thin enough!! THINNER!!!!
8000 dollars...
soundbar. awfull invention
Ethan you know this one&#39;s real
so can the soundbar have an Xbox one plugged into it and output that to the TV?
I really hate the tvOS on all tv&#39;s...That really needs to be reinvented like the smartphone was!
Frikin amazing! Yep. Done deal. I&#39;m getting one... after I sell my car. 😁
It&#39;s absolutely fabulous how LG were able to paint a TV on your wall, but OLED? Seriously? It&#39;s all about Quantum Dot displays now!
black walls + TV =double dope
Gonna cry when I see the cost 😭
I can see why Apple likes LG now
It&#39;s cost $14,990 in Australia. Feck.
thi... nvm
cost more than my car
if i was rich i would buy 50 of those, and them smash half of them on youtube for views
ps4 compatible
think of how good if it would look if the cable was in the wall and the wall was black,I would be druling over how good it would look
How was it shipped?
Well.. i guess i gonna wait till they release a version made from aloe fed lama, oh and of course the thickness of the screen should not exceed 0.4mm
$ k tv and playing shitty 720 p games for kids....
If I had that kind of money I would buy that
Samsung&#39;s SUHD quantom dot displays still looks much better than OLED TVs
That television personifies sexy. Beating my chest to ensure that my heart keeps beating.
$21,600 for the 77&quot; one😧
LG is always a better option than the hyped Samsung TVs.
how about when you want to pull it out a bit to view from a different angle. or maybe tilt it?
Lg and samsung korean company~!!
I was all hell keen to get one of these no matter how expensive... until you said the price... $13500 in AU fark that!
I hope it becomes wireless in the future
Is it just me or are YouTube trying to lose viewers by placing unskippable VERY long advertisements in front of uploaded videos now? I just had to sit through a 4 minute ad to get this video to play.
that is the whitest voice on a black dude i have ever heard
Dream tv specs <br>Very thin like very thin <br>9k resolution Ultra super HD<br>BIG AND LOUD speakers <br>Supports 8k and other resolutions <br>No bezels at all <br>And most importantly cheap price
Holy $8000 tv lol
Let&#39;s talk about 2016 being the last year of the 3D capable TVs.  And I wanna know MB&#39;s experience with 3D especially natively 3D movies and games.
they forgot to thank xiaomi for the idea though
Think i will wait until the tv isnt worth 1/5th of my house.
alright! just need to sell 7 kidneys and I should be able to get it! :D
$8000.... yeah no thanks
Back to the future is almost here... set it up with some 4K scenery and you could be transported anywhere
which mario game were you playing?
This is officially the coolest thing I have ever seen. The Future....
I work at Best Buy and we have a Magnolia and I can personally say a lot of people buy this TV. When you live in a very wealthy area of Virginia and D.C., people will have no problem dropping this cash. So to say not many people will buy this tv is kinda false. We sell TV&#39;s that are more expensive than this one actually and it&#39;s the Samsung KS9800 78 inch for 10k.
Hahah but my Key for the House is thinner  than my Sd Kart
the contrast is good? . lol the fucking contrast ratio is infinite:-infinite because the individual led has its own lighting
How great can the picture be on the basic cable/HD channels if they aren&#39;t being filmed or broadcasted in 4k? And how many movies are really using this super Hi Resolution? I know the games are coming out with it but is it really worth the money right now for a few games and a few movies? I don&#39;t see how the cable HD channels can all of a sudden look that much better just because the tv is 4K? I admit I&#39;m not up to speed on all this new tech so maybe someone can dumb it down for me?I&#39;m referring to all OLED 4K tvs, not this specific one.
I want this tv I NEED this tv :D
what&#39;s the name of the tv stand your sound bar is on it looks amazing!
I am thinking about witch bank I am going o break.
sorry but what a shit tv review. no calibration setting etc etc
this is cool dude
酷不酷？
hello marques. can you guide me if you have the knowledge. what tv is BEST for post processing work? probably at around 100% sRGB maybe adobe rgb too and has a true 10 bit panel?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=228">3:48</a> lol
Hey Marquees, are you going to review the new MacBook Pros? Considering buying one of them but would like to know your thoughts! Cheers
this is cool
I want just the oled panel. Is it possible?
has 4k oled tv <br>&quot;plays mario kart&quot; 😂😂
It&#39;s a detached oversized laptop screen! that is all. Pay attention people! Not worth the price at all!
whens the 120&quot; version coming out?
Damn, I&#39;m a Sony TV lover and have just Sony TVs, but but buuuut this Wallpaper TV is the most awesome I ever saw, good job, LG! :)
that box in the middle of the cable annoys the shit out of me.. like couldn&#39;t they put it just a little before the audio station? or did MKBHD put the cable in the wrong way?
Imagine Watching porn on that TV!
which compny is beast in resolutin ...??
LG?
Wow... this is exactly the kind of TV Apple would have brought out if they entered the space. Beautiful industrial design and a good reason why LG simply make the best TVs out there.
watching this on an s8 plus. totally worth it.
Thinner then the thinnest phone they make <b>compares to a Samsung Galaxy</b>
mkbhd you should do like a nintendo switch review
ps4&#39;s HDMI cable is short holy shit lol
Video too white, cant even see the wall... maybe you should shoot another video with different light so we can understand the actual thickness and size.
Wow
thing of beauty
Drool.
thumb&#39;s up for Elon Musk &lt;3
1000 nits??? please prove it
just like the mcdonalds and burgerking TV´s in their restaurants xD
not worth $8k
this piece of tech cause i can&#39;t call it a TV... shit is to sick to be one... should be classed as like they say wall paper video or something is just so NOICE... the tag is a bit extreme doh....
when the tv looks more real then mkbhd
dat whyte kable doe
Holy shit! I thought a white guy was talking the whole time! Aw, fuck - this means I&#39;m racist.
Give it 2-3yrs and this will be under $1000
A big improvement on my present LG TV!
Wao!
But is it a touch screen though.
Which game are you playing?
LG oled is awesome .........
A rip off of Xiaomi TV 4
dope
I have my 4K OLED budget sitting in my savings just WAITING for ANYONE to make a 4K OLED TV/Monitor that actually has good latency performance. I don&#39;t care about 8k just give us a 300hz 4k OLED with &lt;10ms (freesync &amp; HDR would be a plus) and they will have my purchase.

I think I&#39;ll buy this when the price drops a little bit, like $7500 drop.
I can&#39;t wait to buy this in 10 years!
regime Anyone  hear bigger  this version ? &quot;lawl
Make it wireless and I will buy it, wait 8k!
if i had the money i d buy the sony 25k dollar projector.
L
like the subject but hate the dominating white background.  its looking in to a flashlight.
Are you going to keep the TV??? I would love it...
Sweet view of the antelope getting eaten by birds!
Get 4 or 5 and have them be &quot;windows&quot; that connect to gopros outside. Maybe even a skylight &quot;window&quot;.
can you discuss android tv with an android phone. thanks!
When the TV is thinner than the port of the extender cable! Dyumn Man! 😊
Watching this on full screen 4K is an orgasm of the eyes.
Just watched this video in 4K, and I&#39;m blown away on how good the Nintendo Switch looks on that display!! WOW!
Ok i Guess we are just supposed to admire the others using it and keep waiting for the future
What&#39;s the top 3 sound bar&#39;s for Samsung tv&#39;s?
but what if... i have a better sound system.... than a soundbar...........????????
Er where&#39;s the Scart input ? How does a boy put his video player into this beast!
How long before tech like this OLED will be larger than 100&quot; diag and affordable, ie under $4000?  When this happens i can retire the projector for good.
This isn&#39;t a TV at all, beyond the status of an actual TV. Let&#39;s just call it a thin piece of glass (a phenomenal piece of glass I must say)
I thought it was a white guy talking and you were just in the video facilitating the demo. lol.
critic number relation pdkhhfl revolution process consequence spot responsibility roof acquisition.
8K for a 4K tv.
3.8 mm mm really mm how that&#39;s not even possible mm damn
Hi  peeps ! Fuck wine i really ljke  ! grant   :-))
This might even be as thin as the iPod Touch 5/6!
Anyone else think that extension looks ugly as F$*K and should have just been a longer cable?
That&#39;s just spectacular. I could never justify the cost, but it is amazing.
Still not impressed. I won&#39;t be until they make a TV you can roll like a scroll. Plus this not burglar friendly. Do you realize how careful you have to be when stealing it?

Imagine porn on that TV
Crazy thin.
The speakers poping up is a nice throwback to head lamps which flip out, very sexy.
I&#39;m not here to buy it. I&#39;m here to find out how technology has changed before they begin to turn on us.
Costa Rica
perfect analogy. its looks like aomeone cut an image and pasted it to the wall.
i want this, but ill wait 3 or 5 yrs when it drops to 1500 lol
my TV inst even 1080p
it looks beautiful
They should hide some brightness sensors all around the edge of the panel so that it could adjust the brightness of each part of the screen to match the light falling on the wall at every angle so it&#39;s indistinguishable from a printed photo. It would be great for a photo frame / screensaver mode, rather than just having a black square on the wall.
That might work really well in an RV.
As awesome as this is, I really want to plain about a bunch of things about it. But I won&#39;t. Out of appreciation for progress forward for tech.

Not bothered with the thickness. Display, Sound and Ports are important.
So it&#39;s thinner than a moto z
Super cool!
The TV is really cool... but I don&#39;t know if I want to spend $8000 just for a thinner screen...
review Nintendo switch
Wew! •~•<br>4K comments on a 4K video review of a 4K TV... I so badly want that TV 😍
now THIS is some shit i would spend a hole lot of money on
Bla bla bla !
so you going to have to plaster the cable into the wall to hide the cable , but makes a great window
i am damn sure... in lg company there have alien employees...
TELL ME THAT INTRO TRACK NOW.
Same as MI TV which has launched a few years ago i think lg has copied it
How is it mounted? 3M strips?
Linus Tech Tips brought me here. 😊
which watch do you use??
Hey man, watching this video I was thinking: you should do a video series where you show how different people from different countries consume (buy, use, etc) tech.<br><br>Keep up with the great videos. Peace!
If you get really creative you could do wonders with this TV; I&#39;ll buy the 76.7&quot;, I&#39;ve been waiting for something just like this to replace my old 4K. I love the fact that it&#39;s not a 3D TV; I hate 3D BS, it&#39;s a mature decision from LG, 3D is an annoying fad just like the curved TVs are. <br>I can only say one think: Perfection!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=184">3:04</a> i has a lot of sounds
literally just take out the panel from the tv and put the motherboard in a box
Dios Mios
So why is this better than a projector system?
Whitest voice ever
What else people of this world wants now ? <br>A Giveaway 😂
Too thick TV for me
Wonderful innovation by LG, this new wallpaper TV impress me a lot.
I was really feeling this and I wanted to buy it until I figured out it was $8,000. It&#39;s something I&#39;ll definitely get in the future after I graduate college though, and buy then I&#39;m sure the technology will be better and cheaper. Or at least cheaper, I can&#39;t imagine it getting better than this.
that sound bar needs wifi
what is that turtle racing game ?
It looks &quot;dope/sick&quot;! However Samsung did it, others will follow suit:)! Though my old dream of thin off the wall tvs are not coming real. Help! :) Hey World this should be happening.....about.....now.
Just imagine If Nvidia&#39;s sheild TV is hooked up to this wallpaper....😍
i wanna see this in 5 years except the only port is usb type C the I/o is no bigger than a mac mini and a soundbar is optional. All for less than a grand, get to it LG!
When it be in stores?
Holy shit. I will own one of these one day lol.
you probably need some cable ties for the tv <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wreckless">#Wreckless</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=174">2:54</a> i saw that elon musk interview vid yesterday :D
you have a pretty hard s when you talk actually :)
Love the review! Great shots with that 8K camera!
$8000. US  ?    a little bit ridiculous...........
its cool because even in real life it looks like u got a green screen in the backround
SImply amazing
Screen ticks all my minimalistic boxes.  Saliva is dibbling down my face, which is squished against my display.  I have wanted this all my life without ever knowing it. Thumbs up Marques for top review
Fuckin&#39; magnets, how do they work?
I was telling everyone I know that I want this .... then he said $8000. Worth more than my 04 Accord.
didn&#39;t know he watched PewDiePie&#39;s videos
Yeah right use NS to output 1080p with this TV, so amateur, at least use ps4 pro
The cable wouldn&#39;t be an issue if it wad mounted at proper eye level.
Is it just me or does anyone else find the first shot of marquis watching tv hilarious
but are there cable ties
Dope
if your gonna spend that much on a tv your also gonna get a decent home theather sound setup i home
But ... what&#39;s the frame rate?
Linus convinced me your studio was a pigsty so I subscribed so you could get more velcro straps for your cords.
Uhh, its thinner than my laptop!!!
I love that you watched Elon&#39;s latest TED show ^-^
Marques can you pls do dell xps 15 review, considering to buy it but read so much crap about it
3.8mm good lord is it necessary?
Marques is getting in to cars
They shoulda made the bezels white to make it even more immersive.
OMG I NEED THIS!
$ 8000
what song is this
$8,000? Suck me sideways!
How does LG make any money form stuff like this? So few people will buy it and the designing and production of it was probably expensive.
8000$!!!!!!!  LMAO

&quot;Copied and pasted an image onto the wall&quot; -- The word you are looking for is printed... printed a picture.
This tv wouldnt work in my media room. I have surround sound on a Denon receiver. I wouldnt use this sound bar... they need to make this with HDMI out!
imagine how dope it would look if it had white bezels
Hey MKBHD. Why don&#39;t you review sony phones? Also, there are many budget phones like Gionee, Vivo etc. Would love to see the reviews for these brands too. Will wait for your response. Peace!
give it couple of years, it will be like 1500!!
Eventually, the TV will take up the entire wall.  All 4 walls.  And it will be like living anywhere in the world.  One second you could be in Times Square, the next on a beach in the Maldives.
my tv is 0mm thick <br>its a 4k short trow beamer <br>(i have no projection screen yet)<br>on a dark grey wall colors are amazing
my penis is thinner. I win
I love it! ❤️
wow awsm
This soundbar is atmos equipped. Speakers that rises when powered on are atmos up firing speakers. Its excellent tv with great sound out from box.
How the hell does he earn this much money?
Where I can find the intro music?
But where is the camera they watch you with
Instead of using a ribbon cable from the sound bar to the monitor, it would probably be better if the two were infrared coupled.
@Marques I have only been watching your videos for a short time but if possible you might want to make &quot;Dopetech&quot; your offical catchphrase or something like that. Anyways another great video man thank you!
OMG!!!! I LOVE YOU 4K OLED! I also love love love the thinness and the sound bar !
Must be nice. damn Marquis! impressive.
Love how good MARIO Kart 8 deluxe looks
I bought this tv but now my wallet is thinner than the TV
It&#39;s 8000 freaking dollars!!!
Mario Kart is a destroyer of friendships...
hey marques brownlee please can u give me an iphone 7 plus matt black please give me please
But it surely isn&#39;t as great as the sony 4K HDR OLED TV with speaker built in the display itself
You look so nice!
What&#39;s the intro song&#39;s name?
Is that a grey hair? ha! that&#39;s what you get for shooting in 8k (I know it&#39;s a light reflection)
sound bar is pretty dope
what sound is at the end of video
I knew he would say &#39;bleeding edge&#39; !!!! :D
8K for 4kWTV sounds like a temporary price but look at that thing!
All this is the oled on glass separated apart...minus glass and minus inputs.
That cable arrrrrr😩😩😩😩😩
Now we need to develop a magnetic latch cable that hooks in to the TV, not the base, which would still allow it to be extremely thin.  It could also be used to transfer power, maybe for charging phones and laptops.  It could allow devices to become much thinner.
Samsung needs to step up their TV game..
Hi, what is the track playing at the begining of this video please?  Thanks
I really hate it when people don&#39;t link to their music used. Really need to know that intro song.
I love it.
maybe the top speakers go inside the sound bar to keep dust from getting in since they are facing upward.
Next big step would be to wirelessly connect that sound bar to the tv !!!! I would never buy it cause its most definitely out of my budget but I would love to stare at it !!!
sorry to burst your bubble but my Sony Trinitron is thiner.
dude wat da fluff , man just for show yea NO , ✔💯♨💋😎👍💞 , SMOOCHES SEXY 💋
It almost doesnt look real wow. You know those simulated screens companies use for commercials? it looks like that, But its real..holy hell
Does Samsung use super amoled display for tv or laptop &amp; pc monitor?
That ribbon cable is not in wall rated (CL2 or CL3)
$8,000???? I&#39;ll pass
looks so much fucking fun playing mario kart on that..what&#39;s the price?
now think about this with a wireless connection bridge from the sound bar to the screen... the possibilities are endless
Great! you could find other also on my channel!
Amazing video love the quality .
The sound bar design doesn&#39;t live up to the tv ! It could be so much more sleeker and clean
forget the tv, the natural lighting in your studio is amazing.
Those moving covers I think are good to help speakers not  get dust when they stay for a long time so very cool
TV is amazing, but the cable will only cosmetically work if your walls are white. If your walls are not white, it will look silly. Thumbs up MB!
well i was thinking, never will ever have thing in my house prob like $5k. well nope its $10k.
Awesome. I wan&#39;t one
@MKBHD please review our full Room
this is what tv in the future like
I like the TV with the box in the back... like dat shit
Looks like a sheet of MAGIC.
this is great tv remote like compute mouse <br>wow
&quot;animation&quot; xD
is it 3d capable? because in category of 3d TV LG is best<br>And it&#39;s it available in India ?
I stopped watching when i seen the switch hooked up. 720p on a 4k really?
WOW ! This is really techy -  well done on reviewing this Marques. :)
DAAAYYYYUUUUMMM!!!!
best oled tv&#39;s in the world , yet the flagships have shitty ips. shame on you , lg !!
Why would you mount a tv so high.....
Looks great but I prefer Samsung.. which will definitely come out with something better alongside the Note 8... yummy!
And im here pretty happy with my entry level 4K Tv by Samsung :´D
Im one step closer to buying this TV<br>just in short of 7800usd
Does it flex?
The cable ruins it.
LG lacks in their marketing strategies. 
How&#39;s the WebOS?
Ted talk with Elon Musk :)
Can someone please tell me what is the intro song?
Simply amazing! I&#39;ll get one when they&#39;re so outdated they become cheap and nobody wants them anymore...except me that is.
I&#39;ve never been so interested in a new tv lol. The thinness is absolutely insane!
MKBHD i have loved your content sice 2013 but MR-MOBILE Michael Fisher is my FAV content provider by a long way, and he knows what a pocket pc looks like , a real one !!
I always liked the idea of electronics being external to the panel - it could possibly allow for completely replacing the fastest aging component without requiring you to buy a whole new TV. Need HDMI 2.1? Replace the base. CPU is too slow for modern smart TV solutions? Replace the base. Too bad this will never happen, because it&#39;s probably not in the interest of manufacturers.<br><br>Although I think I might replace the box more often than whole TV (every 6-10 years probably), so maybe it would actually increase the profits in the long run.
Wow, 8000 dollars! Stacking paper, Marques.
I wan to know what is that blue car in the start of the video.. please.. does someone know? please..
Tech Reviewers: We have seen the thinnest TV ever!<br>LG:  Hold my beer!
why do you have it so high up on the wall?
How about the video with Elon Musk on TED ? :)
Song in beginning?
very cool.
which game that ur playing
I&#39;ve got the last generation OLED TV from LG and that&#39;s amazing... and this just jumped 10 years into the future :O Props for playing Mario Kart 8 on the Switch too - looks fantastic!!
Dope ! Will get it when the price drops in 5 years
hello! could you share the wall mount installation process  ?
LG removed 3D technology from this model and the response time is 21ms.
marques whats the soundtrack
want something flush with the wall?... use a projector
cut out the blueshell i see..
its so crazy that it looks fake....
Lets do a drop test!!! 😂😂😂
if you have to break the wall for put the cable inside it, why dont buy a regular tv and do the same but with the tv?
when will this shit cost 500 bux at bestbuy
plees review blackberry keyone
hey guys , i have started a new channel and i am also the tech reviewer ,please chech out my videos, i need your love and support.
The animated pop-up speaker functionality is cool because it keeps dust and accidental spills from damaging them when they are closed.
love the new intro song
Pleaseeeeee Make a new 2017 DREAM SMARTPHONE VIDEO!!!!
Now all we need is for it to connect to the sound bar wirelessly, with Bluetooth 5 or something that can minimize delay, latency and allow multiple I/O.
8k for wallpaper tv.oh wait china is coming.
Now picture that screen with Samsungs infinity edge... you wouldnt even see the bezels... NUTS!!!! @Marques
It&#39;s a TV. Couldn&#39;t care less if it&#39;s 1cm 5cm or 3 inches thick.  Stop shoving shit we don&#39;t want down our throats (I mean manufacturers - not this guy)
Wow! Just WOW! Great product, great video! MKBHD is the man! 👍That&#39;s why we love your channel! And yeah, thumbs up to LG for upping the ante! Keep up guys! 
This tv is 1/10 of an inch thick, my tv is 10 in h thick.
whats the intro music?
pretty dope .. OMG
wow awesome. I love how this stuff reflects the goodness human beings  are capable of.
This is insane. Technology is moving at light speed.  I love it.
All this tech innovation and they couldn&#39;t do a wireless connection from the TV to the soundbar or at least give a regular thinner cylindrical cable that hides better.
Whole new level..
The whole set up is pretty dope!
$8000 and still they couldn&#39;t make that cable wireless.
Great TED with Elon BTW! :)
Shut up and take my kidney
can i have dat nexus 6p or the 5x pls i cant afford anything more than a 50$ lg phone
wow  LG keep coming out with these exceptional designs. it&#39;s  funny how most of us probably though of these but quickly eliminated as a stupid idea I know i did the same with the curve tv idea
not thinner than my wallet though
loved it bro!!!! its a fine masterpiece
Only 8k I&#39;ll take two please
Sweet tv!
Video is BAE ❤️
&quot;most people arent ever going to buy this&quot;<br>fast forward 10 years from now....
that wii controller is pretty fucking cool
Your intro is amazing man...  That can not go unnoticed..  People will talk about it...  Kudos
$1000 per nid
Damn that Wallpaper TV is Sleek and futuristic. Thanks for the review Marques,  your tech videos are always interesting and you have so much charisma (been a fan since your ATH-M50 headphone review).
dude you look like a kid in a candy store. I completely understand.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=24">0:24</a> I know my US Air Force maintainers recognized that -60 gas turbine generator (and the F-22)
Cool video. That&#39;s an awesome tv. Thinnest I&#39;ve seen. The crisp video helps! Keep up the good work 
Cheaper to make a hole in the wall and put the TV inside it! Doing it would make the TV appear even thinner! lol<br>And you can also use a built-in HT in the room, so the setup would look SICK and feel great!
All the things?
Imagine a whole wall filled edge to edge with this tv
It looks like the TV is floating in mid-air.. your white wall is so clean..
My OCD really can&#39;t handle that cable. Please hide it in the wall, it&#39;ll be 💯
damn, that screen is so teeny thin! the comparison with the other objects really drove it home for me, when you said about holding a key up. the colours look fab too... gah, i lust after HDR so much this last year. my graphics card does support it now, but that doesn&#39;t help much if i&#39;ve got no screen to use it!<br><br>thanks for always showing off so much cool stuff, and also, like. you didn&#39;t just gloss over the thing about the cable having the ability to ruin the illusion unless you wanna get someone in to drill little holes. you didn&#39;t focus only on the stuff that was rly cool about it, but also talked about the tradeoff those things have.
This or some variation is on my shopping list.
That TV is insane!! 😲
Hide the cable Dammit
I would love a few of these around my house. Great, in-depth review of a stunning product.
Great shots! The 4k looks great. Nice vid.
As usual, great reviews from MKBH, keep it up! I wish I had that TV though 😩.
This LG TV is nice, but Sony Bravia A1 it&#39;s far way better.<br><br>A1 comes with the speaker integrated in the screen, and the sound comes out in the same position of the images in the TV. Plus, A1 comes with a built-in kickstand like the Surface Pro 4 =)
LoL guys, now just search for this YouTube video: <b>Grayson trick easy money</b><br><br>thank me later on !
8K$ haha... fuck im so poor
Apple will release oled on their iPhone 8 and be like &quot;check our unique new innovative screen&quot;. Samsung had it on like their very first smartphone 6 7 years ago lmao. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23catchup">#CatchUp</a>
Awesome video . great tv
your videos are the only ones i fullscreen.
Great video! Must have been really challenging to film a television without any reflection... would love to know how did you pull that off :) Keep up the awesome work!
What is true is that I love the scenery where you make your videos and present the latest technology. What I really want to say is that I love your work and I hope you continue to do it!!
The samsung wallpaper QLED tv is better in my opinion
Heya! ! whom This vidactually looks likeprevty smaruendure
where did u get all this money to afford one?
That tv is truly and dope and one of a kind and as always a great review from mkb
these guys gets all the cool stuff...
Wow. Great color contrast in the video. Keep doing what you&#39;re doing.
it does look a bit thinner than my tube tv
This TV is so slim and nice, perfect review by the way, I really enjoy the great content and spectacular video quality, specially around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKFnkP_sLQ&amp;t=242">4:02</a>. Keep  making more videos, specially more episodes on the Studio Tour series that you started with Casey Neistat. Thanks!
Did u say 800$ ?? that&#39;s great 😜😜
*gets a superthin state of the art 4k oled screen<br>*tests it with a fhd game<br><br>:c
one of best introductions I ever see or listen to on youtube.keep it up!!😊
thats bizness! aside all the tech which isnt anything that special or new, its a 1000$ tv but since it looks COOOOL you need to pay 8x more!<br>just like with everything else, contents of a product dont match the price.<br>give me a sheet with detailed cost of everything put into the product and im sure, at least 60% of it is pure profit for the company.
Meanwhile i still having old tv which looks like pregnant
Love all your videos, they are very informative and help me a lot in choosing tech stuff.
Love all your videos ,they are very informative and help me a lot in  choosing between tech stuff.
i love it... crazy LG
wow
OMG! This TV is 2 SD Cards thin.BTW nice work marquees if you would not have shown the comparison of the TV with other items. I would not have been able to sleep thinking about how thin could it be. You are really great and inspire a lot. Plus those bezels are BAE.
function for hidden up-speakers: dust reduction.
Personally i liked your channel more when you only dealt with mainstream tech, tech which i could actually use and afford (Nexus 6 purchase, exclusively from you :P ). However, now your videos are flashier, more futuristic, and never fail to give me a glimpse of imagination that goes beyond of what i even thought about before watching the video. Really great job Marquess!
wow.......like it!
TV too thin for an in-depth review - LG nailed it (on the wall)
I think the function of the disappearing speakers is to keep it from getting dusty while not being used.
Thanks for the showcasing this TV. It&#39;s definitely a technology marvel and I&#39;m looking forward to more affordable models down the road with similar technologies and setup by LG. <br><br>I&#39;m also glad that LG is doubling down on webOS which is still one of the best TV OS in the market.
This tech will be amazing when the power is supplied by NFC at a distance(this ability is coming) and the rest is done via WiFi so you don&#39;t need that stupid looking cable.
Everyday your videos keep becoming better and better !One of the very few unbiased youtuber!
and here i am with my 10 year old crt 😅 great vid as always
Your videos are the most crispiest.
should have no edge tho
Nice!
thats dope
do a video on mi6
Marques Brownlee can i get that music at the start.
This product is really amazing  and the artistic way Marques films his videos is even way better. Keep up the amazing work!!!
Thanks for such a great review. I want one immediately, even at that insane price! 😩
While that tv is impressive, it&#39;s not as impressive as Samsung&#39;s because theirs have a super super thin cable, the size of a piece of strong which goes down so it looks like there is no can&#39;t at all because it&#39;s so thin.
Awesome design, very clean and minimalist. Always love the production quality on these videos MKBHD, keep it up.
Is the intro song custom-made or...?
It&#39;s the TV we need but not the one we can buy right now, so we will wait, wait till 8k OLED&#39;s are mainstream. A long wait, A painful wait.
Awesome video as always! Keep up the good work. Love the  cinematography.
Do more gameplay on it.
burglar breaks into his house, better than a bank robbery
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23askmkbhd">#askmkbhd</a> why didn&#39;t you make a video on the surface studio?
what&#39;s the intro song?
Art on the wall looks like it was made by teyleen!
The art on the wall is by teyleen. Look him up in instagram

Sony A1E next please!
Mario Kart looks fantastic on it 😍
unbelievable
is this tv real or is an illusion
Are we ever gonna be able to keep up with technology? Slow down LG, we have small paychecks and so much free time.
Goes along perfectly with my Galaxy s8
Great video! Love the dope tech series
Damn I have to save every single check of mine for a year to afford this
That TV is literally the bleeding edge of technology. It&#39;s just amazingly thin. I&#39;d KILL to have TV like that. Thanks for putting up this video Marques, it was really great!! Keep delivering good content, I&#39;m looking forward to it!
Great video as always, thank you for updating us on the latest tech and unbiased reviews.
Really great,but Xiaomi has already introduced MI TV about 6 mnths before ,that comes with same concept of soundbar.
Marques you&#39;re glowing In this video😍😍❤👀😩
curved edge tv panels? galaxy s8 style?
This is definitely impractical in a house with adventurous kids. Wish I could lay my hands on one of those. Really &#39;dope tech&#39;, nice video. great job man. 👍👍
best tech vids out there man! keep up the good work. always appreciate hard work
Wow! Awesome job on the video, that tv is the coolest thing I have seen all year, many of your shots of it made it look like a video was just pasted onto the wall!
@mkbhd Is does sound bar comes with the tv or is that sold separately.
GREAT TV BUT SHIT RIBBON CABLE FOR 8 GRAND.
Just get a projector
Awesome review of this nice panel :) .  This is the kind of review that you can base a purchasing decision on.  Thanks!
Dude that is freaking great , I wish I had one on my room
Hey Marques, I really enjoyed your video! That TV looks really awesome - especially its thinness and its tiny bezels. Thanks for covering it!
Some laptop displays are $3k so 8k for one of the best TVs on the market doesn&#39;t sound bad
marq your undoubtedly the best tech YouTuber out there the effort you put into making these videos the glam shots the presentation every thing is just awesome
that Elon Musk interview tho 😍 it was amazing 😍
Thanks for the video MKBHD.....<br>LOVED IT!!!!<br>KEEP MAKING SUCH VIDEOS
What brand is your bracelet??????
MKBHD I love your review of this LG 4K W TV because I want one and your reviews are very informative and entertaining so thank you
I think... i am in love :D
that tv is pretty cool but what about a link to that intro song
Damn!<br>This TV is really amazing!!!<br>And looks even more amazing in the way you shot it. Great cinematography!!
Can you make a video about Sonos
The price is the double of the resolution 😂
hay man how about the infocus epic 1 review
Badass!
The video was brilliant. I really like these Dope Tech Videos. Explanation of the concept was great, also the cinematography was phenomenal as usual. &lt;3
Great tv... but run the wire in the wall. Ruins the whole look. Grab some conduit for the in-wall install.
I&#39;m like wow i want this TV and  you said $8,000 bloody hell NO!
mkbhd you should do a Dear Google (2017)
Woah got to get this.. *$8000. Nvm fam I&#39;m going to hang onto my kidneys.
Hey Marques, love the video. You never fail to produce great quality. I especially liked the shots where you can see how thin the TV really is, also in comparison to the g6. of course the Mario part was, that&#39;s the type of thing that makes your videos unique
Spends $8000 for a TV then uses soundbar. Who really does that?
Those nice side shots really show the thinness of the tv, nice camera work here, it must have been hard to put this out. And I&#39;m not talking about the light work behind this (as seen on snapchat ;- ) ), that must have been a challenge as well, nice job.
Now I&#39;m curious what Marques&#39; thoughts are on the Nintendo Switch... you going to do a video on it sometime?
Finally a device in which I can watch your videos in 4K. It&#39;s so weird to watch this video on my laptop. It feels like you edited another video on top of you original one. Doesn&#39;t feel like a tv hahahaha amazing!
dope!
Is this 3D?
Thanks for the update that Elon&#39;s video was up (:
Light sugar pattern beat growth your interpret weight orange.
damn... I just thinking what&#39;s gonna happen in 2099
Great review👌👌👌
Send me one, will you?
I am looking at a 4k tv being recorded on a 4k camera, and my 1080p monitor is freaking out
Do you ever look at a comment and wish that you wrote it after looking at all of the likes?
Holly crap, that is crazy thin!!! :D :D :D
consoles cant play 4k games so no point in getting this for gaming
lol the 77&quot; and the 65&quot; are both the same price! Why wouldn&#39;t you just get the 77&quot;???
Please review new Microsoft Laptop
by the way that apple iphone 7 plus commercial - the city, totally ripped off Bose&#39;s ad for the QC35. just wanted to say that .. they have comments disabled on apple&#39;s channel
Wow this is amazingggg
Dope Video of  Dope Wallpaper TV....Seems like , after smartphones ,TVs are going after &quot; Slimmer the better&quot; Vibe &quot;...
man that looks sick. obviously I won&#39;t be this but when I buy a house next year, I&#39;m going to counter sink the TV into the wall to make it kinda like this. I&#39;ll have to do an access panel on the wall behind the TV but it will be worth it.
cool but you have to hide that cable
The TV is indeed Dope! Good job on presenting objectively the features of this &quot;statement&quot; of how far can the technology go!
i saw the advert for this and it saids its Q led not oled
Marques, why is your tv so high up?! Do you like watching it while standing or do you like cramping your neck?!
Who is the white guy?
Need everybody that viewed this video to send me 1$
finally mkbhd is on trending :D
Within a few years, these will become commonplace. And then I&#39;ll buy one lol
how does it feel about your clippers losing to utah? lol choke choke
Installed way to high would look better lower,closer to the stand
wish we could afford fucking oled
Hey Marcus you think you can do a video on best college laptops to get or tech for the new 2017 semester
That t shirt is dope too
