The phrase ‚Äúit&#39;s just a game‚Äù is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you&#39;ve lost twice. There&#39;s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

After 7 months the Japanese was never forgiven by jojo, now excuse me while I bleach my mind
Pewdiepie: Really when Pewdiepie says small pp he meant big brain.<br><br>Also Pewdiepie: I have big brain.
Its jojo.....
Pewdiepie is a good friend of ninja..He acknowledges him and then calls out his bullshit as well not like other trash talkers or yes men..He gives constructive criticism..
It‚Äôs mostly popcap that developed pvz
Ninja looks like that one vegan from the vegan challenge

Felix is wrong, pp 10 is actually kinda small because pp = 10 + your perception modifer. I actually have an 18 and wisdom and proficiency in perception so i have a +6 making my pp 16
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPFHqWYJz-4&amp;t=54">0:54</a> Where does that come from?<br><br>7 months later: <b>wears JoJo shirt for 2 weeks</b>

Why does pewdiepie this that every anime meme he doesn&#39;t know is from full metal alchemist
we don&#39;t mention the bridge
Craaaaaaaap
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPFHqWYJz-4&amp;t=57">0:57</a> thats jojo i think

Wait wait wait <br>So pewds called the person that robbed his house small pp. BUT earlier in the video he also said that plot twist small pp means big brain.
You what else is embarrassing? Blocking out a word just to not block it out 10 seconds later üòÇ<br>Floor gang ahooh
Bonk Bonk...
I really hope he was Jokong because he makes so many jokes about jojos, and went on a rant about how Joesph cusses in English very obnoxiously
Pewdiepie that is jojo

Yare Yare Daze
It‚Äôs JOJO Reeeee
The guy that responded on ninja&#39;s tweet was ducky, another fricking pro fartnite gamer lol
Pewds just casually sprinkling in the fact that he watches Drew Gooden
Is that a Jojo‚Äôs reference?
Pewdiepie stairs are going to become a pilgrimage site for future floor gang religion

That boy reminds me of meee peopleee, well, I broke my head, I had a craneoencefalic trauma,  that got me paralyzed for 6 months, and as he said, had to learn to walk, me too, it was so hard, thinking you‚Äôre useless, I got depressed, I had to learn how to speak, it was hard, so hard, he is like me, I don‚Äôt think that others would understand, the pain of being trapped in your body for a long time, I tried a lot of things to stop my suffering, but I started thinking that was so lucky to be alive with a 98.2 of dying, I worked hard, I worked hard to be here, happy, enjoying my life, even tho I was pretty bad for 8months, I‚Äôm still in my rehabilitation, well, we stopped because of covid-19, hey in my channel, there‚Äôs a video of me, how I surpassed my challenges, thank you Felix, you brought me lots of fun, while depressed, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, you helped me too, love you guys.üòãüòä

Poor Marzia also felt bad for being upset she was robbed. She is too pure, there is a difference in being upset what you had is gone and being upset that you can&#39;t have more possessions. Being sad that a bunch of stuff was stolen from you is not materialistic, being mad that you don&#39;t have enough is.
