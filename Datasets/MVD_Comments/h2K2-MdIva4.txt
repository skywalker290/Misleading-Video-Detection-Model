I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his place to tell people what they can and can‚Äôt do with their bodies though.. and to tell people they look ugly just because they got something done to make THEMSELVES feel better is pretty disgusting.. I expect better from Felix

13 january now good job youtube...
Everybody grow up PewDiePie&#39;s coming
In the UK hot and cold water come from the same source and the hot water is just heated up in the boiler so its perfectly safe we used to have hot water tanks and some people still have them the problem with hot water tanks is that the water can be sitting in that tank for ages before its used in some cases people have even found dead drowned rats stuck in the tanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=307">5:07</a> : &#39;&#39; its really bad, its black, don&#39;t use it&#39;&#39; lol

Pewdiepie the puppet at the end is of a bacteriophage and In a few decades they will take the place of antibiotics! You will inject those things into your stomach and things! I know that you needed to know that.
Is he dyslexic? Not trying to be rude at all, genuinely curious bc he can never read lol

But what if he got the tattoos ironically.....
This is an old video, but to anyone who sees this, he didn&#39;t quite fully explain <b>why</b> hot water isn&#39;t good. Hot water heaters have a high metallic content from the tank and in general the water, while not toxic or bacteria infested (so hot showers are fine), you really dont want to be ingesting it regularly, so use the cold water which doesn&#39;t touch the boiler.

I can relate to the kicked parasite. When I was in 3rd grade I accidentally stepped on a praymantus. It&#39;s lower half was crushed but it was still alive and next thing you know a long black worm comes slithering out like a belly buster and the praymantus tries to kill is while it&#39;s still half in its torso. I&#39;m in 8th grade and still remember it well.....

Actually that puppet he saw (12:8) Was a bacteriophage which is responsible for the death of more then half of all ocean bacteria everyday! They use a stinger between they&#39;re legs to inject they&#39;re genetic material into e bacteria, then the bacteria is forced to make more phages until it is so full that the small phages produce an enzyme that explodes the host, There is almost one species of phage for every bacteria or virus out there, Also fun fact is that most viruses like Covid are just a shell of fat molecules in casing its DNA or RNA
<b>Grosssssss</b>
‚ÄúWe start with insects, we then take the children‚Äù. You had me there. Thats all you had to say. PEWDS FOR PRESIDENT!!!

Seeing the thumbnail I thought it was a large spider taking a shit. Now that I actually watched the video it was just a gecko inside of a spider toy.

apple + starbucks seems like an expensive life
So... what you&#39;re saying is that you will put all children in concentration camps? Cool.. I&#39;m down. Wait.. do you count 16 year olds? I hate other kids and teenagers as well. I know how to annoy them, entertain them, hurt them (But not physically), hurt them physically. I could be an essential asset to your uprising.
Thumbnail got me thinking wtf is that, sorry I didn&#39;t recognise Pewds...
I am never going to sleep again...
Pewdiepie 2024 for no children or wet sleeves and socks!
2 parasites and i&#39;m eating noodles
the friends with the plastic surgery is doing a jojo reference
I feel like it sounds like Felix has something in his mouth. Like a gumball or something
Pewdiepie...you better be careful calling kids germ-spreading creatures. After all, everyone who watches your channel is 9.
Hot water bad it‚Äôs black
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=625">10:25</a> i actually used to think that it was true

I vote for you
Wouldnt hot water be cleaner since bacteria cant handle heat. AND doesnt it really matter since odds are its going to get boiled
I havent watched pewdipie in so long omfg, last time was like 3 years ago
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=348">5:48</a> the crocs of the future
When Felix will ban all children, humanity will not repopulate and  pass the bloodline, so all he‚Äôs doing is killing everybody, but even people who have that in mind will still vote and do everything to get Felix to the presidential seat
Introduction to this vid: No he doesn&#39;t turn it to a hat...<br>Later in the vid: guess whats his doing in the comments
The last time water was black there was a dead body in the water tank..that school might wanna check that out
With what pewds said about the hot water <br><br>1. It does boil faster<br>2. People use to drink boiled water because any other water was nasty with parasites and germs
&quot;we start with the insects, then we take the children&quot;<br>vote PewDiePie for supreme leader of earth
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=704">11:44</a> kinda looks like grey matter from ben 10

Yes so awful
Vote pewds 2024!
It&#39;s so embarrassing but he&#39;s right that&#39;s definitely the US with the pants and wig lady. I live here.  That&#39;s not even the worst I&#39;ve seen.

Naaa i think u can destroy the insects and the kids at the same time because there both insects
Real talk, if the bacteria in hot water can survive boiling for 10 minutes, it deserves to enter my body and make its home there.
Pretty sure water turning black like that is a sign something died in the water tanks... Hope there were no missing kids :/

What&#39;s the problem with black water?<br>Are you racist?
im ten and somehow agreed that kids are disgusting. i think im dying
I once was watching a video on how to get rid of earwigs and it had a scratchy noise like a bug wiggling around at the beginning. Then later on there was the same noise, but it was in a weird place. Took out my head phone looked inside. Yup. Earwig. Inside my headphone. Developed a new fear and habit of checking my headphones that day.

That old lady&#39;s twisted sister wig made my day lmao

Boiling hot water kinda kills the bacteria...
Hello, It is me, the water nerd man. Drinking hot water is bad since certain bacteria can live in it and it can make you really sick, that is why we humans don‚Äôt like hot water, it‚Äôs a defense mechanism. Now boiling hot water is fine though because the bacteria can‚Äôt survive the boil and die, so actually I fully recommend using hot water since it boils quicker.
Felix: Every last insect will be destroyed<br>Spider: *PHEW*, close one

If you&#39;re a girlie man  or tiny boy or cross dresser, get Tsuki clothes! If you&#39;re any larger than a tiny boy, nothing will fit! IT&#39;s racism against people not underweight.

PewDiePie, shut up, like just shut up.. you&#39;re like Children are bad/stupid/disgusting but most of your viewers are kids also your comments and subs are from children, Don&#39;t belive me?? Hmph. You&#39;ll be surprised. If kids didn&#39;t exist you would have like 2 million subs. like if you agree.
The thumbnail of this video haunts me, literally, it keeps popping up asking me to watch this video.
Anyone notice at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=8">0:08</a> (pause the video) that if u look on the left of this chair it‚Äôs a üëåüèº symbol

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=730">12:10</a> Felix the puppet thing is actually based on a real thing. <br>it&#39;s based on a bacteriophage, which are microscopic viruses that kill bacteria.

I had no idea about the hot water from taps being a health risk. Apparently it&#39;s to do with lead pipes contaminating hot water more easily. Not ONE single fucking person in my entire life EVER mentioned this, and of course I&#39;d never even suspect it was unhealthy on my own, it&#39;s just tap water after all. I feel so betrayed.

It‚Äôs not the forbidden Oreo it‚Äôs actually a Cyclocosmia it‚Äôs part of the trapdoor spiders and it‚Äôs also known to be extremely rare and often called an Hourglass spider. They use their abdomens as traps doors and when a bug walks over it they sink in to the hole cause if the bug to drip in with it and they feast.(this is what happens when your ‚ÄúThat‚Äù kid in class and when asked to do a presentation on an animal shelter Nostradamus of choosing a dog,cat,fox,wolf,shark no you choose a rare spider that terrified your classmates.

I was on the bus and slapped the seat for my friend to sit down and a cloud blew into his eyes and he spent 10 minutes cleaning out his eyes.
I saw one of those parasites at boy scout camp once. I crushed it with a rock and dumped a glob of hand sanitizer on it
Instead of killing the children, send them to a island like you said in earlier videos so I can go and finally use my boy scout survival skills to kill every child and create a tribe to kill larger groups of children and we will become adults and be sent back to the real world and meet you
&quot;We start with the insects, we then take the children.&quot; My new life motto. Thank you Pewds.

33 lunar seconds is 15 mins
Zombie cricket
The clip with the old lady in the crazy wig looks like it was written and directed by David Lynch.
There are 24 hours in a day, each hour has 60¬†minutes¬†and each minute has 60 seconds. So one second is 1/86400 of one day. Which mean that one &quot;lunar second&quot; is equal to approximately 27.3 earth seconds. 33 lunar seconds are therefore slightly above 15 earth¬†minutes.
Why is pewdiepie from,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2K2-MdIva4&amp;t=645">10:45</a> It looks awful, but when you think about it a little... that spider is super tiny. Still it wouldn&#39;t see the light of day should I find it in mine. I kill spiders on sight.

children are the biggest environmental problem...<br>1. They add up to the total population (overpopulation)<br>2. When they grow up they usually want kids themselves<br>3. Overpopulation is the main source of all the consumerism that is poisoning the world... higher demand means higher production (of everything)<br>4. They think they are good a minecraft or fortnite but in fact they are not!<br>Man, i hate children XD
