Live from 2024 ...... 😊
have the oneplus 7t pro since 2019.<br>it&#39;s near perfect but:<br>- back breaks easily without cover, already replaced twice<br>- mic issues, sometimes silent<br>- occassional software bugs
Anyone here in 2023?
Still OnePlus ❤, even tho it&#39;s software is trash now as a secondary phone its solid all these years later
From P4 being bust of the year to P7 winning the best phone of the year award. Good to see improvement, but despite this I have very good memories with P4 and it was amazing device.
POV: you’re here after the 2023 smartphone awards
Who would have known that after 3 years, Google and OnePlus would trade places for the MVP and bust of the year!
Nice smartphone award 2019 video man and smartphones are so cool :]
Watching this video after 4 year 😅
When smartphone industry peaked
For low budget  i am watching this in 2023😊
The production value of these videos is spectacular!
Do MKBHD give those trophies to the companies?
300 bucks is &quot;budget phone?&quot;
Those were the days which made Samsung and apple jealous of OnePlus and then teamed up and bribed OnePlus to self destroy their brand.... And which made the CEO of 1+ uncomfortable and made him quit.... And later destroyed themselves by changing the features which made OnePlus different from others like OXYGEN OS..... and then downfall started gradually...  .... Then they even tried to remove the iconic Alert Slider also!
Did you notice MKBHD&#39;s damaged t shirt<br>I mean the logo
i am going to buy pixel 4xl in 2023...😍😍

Marcus is an awesome guy. As decent as it can get.

Pov. Your here because u still have a iphone 11
I brought the OnePlus 7 pro 2 years ago because of this video. Even though the phone is still moving amazing till this day. I dropped a cup on it and smashed so the screen so time for a new one
<b>pov: you&#39;re here after the 2021 smartphone awards</b>
I love how there’s 5 iPhones on the table but only 3 were released in 2019
Uhm no offense, but the iPhone 11 pro has the least amount of sacrifices from the 11 pro max. I don’t see how the s10e won the compact phone award with even more sacrifices from the s10 and s10 plus. Just sayin
samsung galaxy s10 was and is the best
Getting the 2019 MVP 1Plus 7t pro for myself tomorrow
I&#39;m in 2021
Pov: your here harder the 2021 phones
None of the oneplus phones made it into the 2021 list.

Marques...Please help me decide, should I get the Oneplus 7 Pro or Iphone XS Max?
Watching on my Pixel 4 😭
You did not mention p30 pro? bro you give best cameras to the boring 12mp iphone 11 and p30 pro have actally the same camera quallity and also say that note 10 is a better phone? Total waste of time everyone knows that huawei is leading the camera department (but not video) unless you are a fanboy.P30 pro and Mate 30 pro is milles ahead of the competition and they are full package phones with very good battery cameras and built quality
OnePlus 7 Pro?
Samsung and iphone fans, me: wtf
i&#39;m here in 2021 to buy old phones for an even better deal.
that is why samsung throws this many smartphones to public

Very interested to see how the 2020 awards go. OnePlus becoming more unbudget friendly, Pixels going budget friendly, etc.

I Can’t Even Buy One
So do people like this who handle so many phones and do so many reviews....have a private daily driver phone? Like I love tech but using so many phones would make me scattered, unless I had a main phone on the side.
Full table of phones but only 2 operating system
Meets Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Satya Nadela he wears funky cool MKBHD tshirts.<br>When it comes to the SMART PHONE AWARDS, he&#39;s gotta suit up.
I&#39;m using the Google pixel 4 XL it&#39;s by the far the best phone I used, coming from iPhone 10, I don&#39;t agree and Marques your bust of the year phone award really did hurt my feelings
When is 2020 coming?
Is not about the experience but the fanciness....
the 2020 buget phone should be alcatel 1s it costs about $100

The name Marques Brownlee just screams tech at me
Nah, people completely forgot about foldable phones.
I feel like Apple saw this vid and actually took ideas cause 12 series has a lot of stuff he was rating all the phone for.
Imagine he got robbed while recording this.

Suit and a t shirt 🤦🏻‍♂️
The dislikes are from the phones that didn’t get picked. 🤣🤣
My OCD was screaming every time he put a phone down a bit skewed.
Now tell me that you rented all those phones to make this video.😭😭😭
He talked about the asus 2 in 3 different awards. Not once did he mention the screen size.
Far too many IPhones as best phone???not biased eh?  I got rid of my I phone much happier with Samsung.
Iphone is the best and I don&#39;t care what people think....
The biggest flex in the vid wasn’t even the phones, it was the awards given to the phones.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=1337">22:17</a> Yes. That is 2020.

And im watching this on an 100$ phones

Let&#39;s hope OnePlus can get the MVP for 2020 to make a 3 straight record....🔥

This video is so good!
Hey! <br>Did any smartphone maker actually asked you for the trophy?<br>I think they should/must, and also every smartphone r&amp;d teams should/must watch this video<br>Simply Amazing!!!
I&#39;m like a Kid Wow I can see Note 10+ on the Table hope it be Awarded and Ther Marq Picks it up 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Predicting Z fold 2 5G will take the most improved award for 2020
Year after year you put pixel phones over galaxy as the better camera and I dont get it.<br><br>Video performance isnt even close. Image you get and the sound is only surpassed by Iphone, not to mention versatility of shooting modes and stabilization.<br><br>The gap between the video quality of two phones isnt made up with slightly better image processing in stills.
Marques: You hate to give out a negative award<br>Also Marques: Runner-up to worst phone
If the samsung galaxy z fold 2 was out back then, then it would have won most improved award
I will give iphone 11 pro max a 1st..<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The first to be very <b>expensive</b>
No huawei 😭
Happy to have the OnePlus 7 pro
2020 awards coming soon boys
I literally just rewatched every MKBHD phone award because I&#39;m so hyped for this years awards. My money is on that either the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE or OnePlus 8T will win MVP.
Where is the most durable category?
I wonder how much that table cost.
Nice work mate
What does he mean with best compact ?
My eyes are on your suit
S10 e not good phone camera is bad
<b>Marques goes on a date</b><br><br>Girl:  &quot;so what kinda phone you got?&quot;<br><br>Marques: &quot;ummmmmm &quot;
I just went through all of your smartphone awards videos hoping to find a nice compact phone to replace my iPhone 7 (because I can’t reach the top corner with one hand comfortably) but apparently I already own the smallest phone out there. <br><br>Honestly it’s disappointing to find that phones as large as 150mm are taking the top spots in the “Compact” category.
do a kickflip
This mans has my entire life&#39;s earnings sitting on a table in front of him
Do you own all those phones?...im sorry im trying to concentrate but i just cant wrap my head around how many phones are on that table😭😭

I just bought Bust of the year phone lmao
I recently got a new smartphone and I actually love it. It has everything you could ever need and more. The only thing kind of hard is to find a good online shop. I got mine from shoplightroom. com and it works magically. I highly recommend!!!

You should wear a full formal suit and do these awards, We&#39;ll get to see you in a suit once a year.

I know not many people would want it but I would kind of like to see best phone with headphone jack award or like mention for this year&#39;s video. Just my thoughts.
Where is Realme X2 pro...<br>It definitely win 2 Awards. <br>1. Battery charging<br>2. Budget Smartphone<br>In my opinion.
I thought the best smartphone would be note 10 plus
Aint no body watch this!
I have a iPhone 11pro riplay yors👍👍👍
No way I thought iPhone 11 Pro Max will win like bruh U SUCK iPhone pro u actually suck
Best phone with a replaceable battery? Nope, sorry, you can&#39;t get that. Only planned obsolescence devices are allowed.
Thanks for the avard!
For the bust I thought it was galaxy f

How is the one plus 7 pro better than the ROG 2 as the MVP?
The &quot;budget&quot; phone was $400 USA??  I bought a refurbished Moto G7 power from Amazon for $147 a year ago,  new priced at $189 as of today. Budget also should have a category of Unlocked CDMA\GSM no contract phones(that can make a huge difference if you have cash on hand vs paying more over time), also phone longevity with some IP Rating(dust/water repellent). Unfortunately the Moto G series being an exceptional phone easy to get in USA with dual CDMA/GSM to use on my local Cricket etc they are not durable at all.. Paid for 3 in the last 4 years or so.. Basically if a phone had longevity and cost more I would seriously consider paying 3x. Another HUGE issue is that the USA version of the OnePlus 7t with 1 year warranty costs about $150 more to $670, the 7t from Walmart is $499 but you can pay for device protection, $95 for 2 year or $129 for 3 year. Basically the warranty version is shorter and has a broader range of failure but Walmart last years longer and where my Moto G series failed , mostly do to water damage. Also consider Lithium Batteries do deteriorate over time...
For me the Note 10+ has the best cam of 2019 <br>Actually it won in the blind test  so no way . It&#39;s the best
Now make a category for best Non-Communist China phone. Obviously Apple shouldn&#39;t be included.
budget phones at 299 and 399<br><br>me with my 99 dollar phone
Iphone realized that whenever you ask an apple head, what do you like about Iphones? 90% of answers are: &quot;the camera&quot;
There is no doubt that the best camera of 2020 will go to SAMSUNG S20 ULTRA 😂😂😊😊
Marq: Best smartphone camera categorie<br><br>Me: Here comes a Huawei<br><br>Marq: Iphone 11 pro max 📱<br><br>Me: 😰
I can already feel we are going to look back at the first folding smartphone and think it was the chunkiest thing ever 😂
My s10e is amazing.  Glad it got some recognition.

I skipped to many phones by Headphone Jack
The bust of the year should be given to iphone 11,😏😏😏
He lied. Samsung won the blind smartphone camera test
Why did you cut out your comments on why the pixel 4 is so bad?
Did you buy all the phones ?
His music taste💯
Cry&#39;s in s10plus
Man can you make a video of this best awards of 2019 phones vs current phones today. And showing how much the best of 2019 cost right now.
Me seeing pixel 3 as runner up budget:*cryes in redmi note 8 pro*
Am I the only one that is sad that my galaxy 10 plus didn&#39;t won?🤣😅
Glad Motorola got a mention! Personally one of my favorite brands. Poor LG didn&#39;t even exist in this video.
Can I get one of them plz..
S10e squad where you at?
where is iphone xr...??????
Someone has won the lottery😄
I think samsung note 10 plus is very underrated
I like the ASOOS
He should have give the bust of the year award to the royal flex pie
is there the samsung a20e
The Royole Flexpai crawled so the Galaxy Z Flip could do a 100m sprint
someone dares to say that rog phones lags alot and iphone 11 pro max is better
The awards look beautiful.. I love the note 10 plus tho
Hay bro listen you have this many phones can you giveaway one to me 😀
One plus 7t ❤️
like filthy frank said, I only care if my phone can play music and porn
People who still use headphone jack. Band togher Brothers and sisters. <br>👇
Hey MBKHD you should add a category called &quot;best (best budget) unlocked works on ANY CARRIER phone&quot; or call it best BYOD phone. Some of us switch carriers value versatility of phones w every radio included.
whats with the coat Marques??? going on a date?
in the back ground you can kind of see that the biggest award has oneplus 7 pro written on it
Asus Rog 2 didn&#39;t get a lot of attention from the big crowd, but it still won so many awards lol
s10 plus  ❤
I hate oneplus
Didn’t anyone see the PewDiePie headset
Wheres realme x2 pro in budget? 🙄
give me one phone please
And the reward for the most overpriced award goes to..<br><br><br><br><br><br>I think we all know who it goes to.
no skill so boring
I love you 😘
In Australia, the Redmi K20 pro costs anywhere from 800 to 1000 dollars. not as much of a budget phone as in america.
i luV my iphone 11pro.     i used Androids all my life.  ive purchased iphones for other ppl.      So this my personal 1st iphone purchase.  🔥🔥
ok so we stan Asus up in this house....
Oneplus 🔥
Had fun watching this
Can&#39;t get the budget phone winner for anywhere near that price. Where can we get someone who reviews phones that Americans can buy?
I think all tech YouTubers should arrange a tech award together
cringe
I really hope you could do dramatic lighting for this year phone award
Bruh can I have one of those 😂😂😂
I like Huawei&#39;s phones also OnePlus
Wow, LG V50S wasn&#39;t even mentioned once. For me it is the most complete and well rounded phone of 2019.<br>✅ Headphone Jack<br>✅ Micro SD Card Slot<br>✅ 4000 mAh Battery<br>✅ Snapdragon 855<br>✅ Good Audio<br>✅ Great Display<br>✅ Amazing Camera (Both Photo and Video are fantastic because of manual mode)<br><br>Plus you get that Dual Screen with additional features. Man, LG is so underrated and underappreciated since that G4 bootloop problem that has been fixed for years now.
I thought the 11 pro max would have been an honorable mention in the battery department...
Bro.. are you a millionaire or billionaire??????☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹
Galaxy fold 2 most improved this year. Book it lol.
who is watching from galaxy s10e
You look Smart!
How bout some A-series Samsung? Because of the low price and plastic back they&#39;re beneath you ? BULL-------<br>I&#39;ll throw my A71 or S10 lite in there and tell me what phones gonna be better all round budget&amp; mid-range ($400) on eBay bnib! Nothin on you desk comes Close!;;<br>Aside from the rog <br>Not fair Marques , you owe your fans the entire story! A71 $379 retail<br>Same chip as Nord which originally in their own vid said it&#39;d retail $398 tops, it seems to keep going up, anyway I know Samsung release a very wide selection of mid rangers the most notable being the a 51a 71 and the newest S10 light and Note 10 lightthose phones stand alone in their own category at $400 I don&#39;t know how much of a better phone any manufacturer could possibly produce and guaranteed if they were glass sandwich they would be up there on your number one list somewhere they are intense very intensely great Bones come on Marcusyou owe it to wash review an S10 review and a 71 put it against the Nord put it against the pixel put it up against something and see what happens!<br>Anyway thanks for listening to my little rant
The iPhone 11(not Pro Max or even Pro) doesn&#39;t have that great battery, what?
Wait we can already see all the winners in the background whaaaaaaaaaat ( it is printed in the trophies)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=292">4:52</a> If you’re a Logic fan you’ll notice “The Incredible True Story” Vinyl I believe in the background
if ur budget phone is 4000USD then it isn&#39;t budget
These also happen to be my favourites.
so 2020 rog phone 3 wins all
I was getting so mad at you for not putting the one plus 7 pro up there but then you declared it as the winner, Thank you.
The moment you see that guy coming towards you with a such a beautiful suit, you can already tell it&#39;s gonna be good..
i need a new phone
They shouldn&#39;t need a improved award they should be a good phone from the start like Samsung
i love hauwei bro
no htc and sony
woah now this is cool and entertaining, i know im very late to react to this but man nice awarding definitely my new favorite spec reviewer
thank goodness my res is 480p so the awards at the back dont spoil it
I miss the days where a 700 dollar phone was considered expensive
We need best sceen award.
Who&#39;s watching in July.
“Redmi K20 pro” said it just like tony stark
Mr. Mkbhd samsung s10+ we&#39;re it stand for, it&#39;s a beast buddy
This is like GAME AWARDS 2018<br><br>ASUS ROG PHONE II : Read Dead Redemption 2<br>One plus 7 pro :  God Of War (ps4)<br><br>RDR2 won all other awards,<br>GOW won the big award
I don&#39;t ever think a iphone will ever win best phone of the year<br><br>Apple: :(<br>Me: Stop being salty to Apple you tech youtubers
December 23rd is my birthday!!!!!!!
Where is realme x2 pro?
Man i can respect this &quot;smartphone award of the year&quot; award just for incorporating a compact phone category
realme X2 pro should be best buget  phone🤨
Could u give any phone
Imma get the samsung s10+ bc imma cwol kid😎
I bought the Oneplus 7pro just a few weeks ago. So far I love it.
does anyone else think the oneplus 8 pro is NOT going to win the 2020 smartphone awards?<br><br><br>i think that way
Pixel 4 is  beautiful phone, if this phone dont having big ass forehead...
The intro was fresh
Imagine having a smartphone all over your table.<br><br>-This comment is promoted by <br>everyone-that-isn&#39;t-a-tech-YouTuber gang
Did you have 2 OnePlus 7 pro phones on the desk?
I feel like if smartphones were a family the Pixel would be the stepchild that is good in school and an overall decent person but for some reason nobody likes them.  Then the iPhone is the cocky favorite child who gets everything they want despite being an underwhelming jerk.
OnePlus:  Never Settle Till It Dominate The Smartphones.
Don’t buy Sunboost Solar it’s cheap and nasty
Me: <b>exists</b><br>Marques: pulls off wearing a suit over a shirt whilst plugging his merch at the same time. <br>Me: 😔 <b>sigh</b>
I do know why and I swear I dreamt about  you 😃 MKBHD we were having different conversations Especially about tech while traveling in the bus 🚌  for sure you’re unique to me among different YouTube reviewers 😊 Thank you stay blessed

everyone watches video<br>me : *looks in the background*, why does the rog phone has 3 awards
Love from India
Lol 😆 @ all the comments about Pixel 4. I have a 3XL and I love ❤️ 💗 💕 it. Also an IPad and Microsoft laptop 💻 My fav device is my Pixel
huawei mate 30 pro&#39;s camera is better than the iphone
Dame can I have one? Lol I&#39;m still using this bull crap old phone
Hey marques,, you missed realme x2 pro..<br>How on earth you can ignore this phone?
Watching this on my OnePlus 6T, I&#39;m Proud 😭
This is like Billie winning over Lana and Ariana
Most compact phone : s10e<br>Me watching on my s10 : <br>ahh shit shouldve bought that one
Best budget/The Best phone of 2019 is realme 2 pro hands down
marques:if any of the phone developers who want their awards, i&#39;ll ship them out <br>makers of google pixel 4 :Crying in the corner
hahahahahahahhhahahahahahhahahaahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhahhahhahahahahahhahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=85">1:25</a> pewdiepie headphones spotted
We just gonna ignore that Marques made whole ass award trophies for phones like they’re gonna accept it and give it a speech
My boy looking clean
WTF where is the realme x2 pro smartphone
Mine cost one more dollar
i rlly want apple to do folding phones because i love the idea of a folding phone but i don’t like android
Watching on my OnePlus 7 pro 😎
Watching this on a oneplus 7 pro
no love for xperia 1
so no best display award <br>samsung would have easily won that
Grt job sir
Hey marques can I gift me a  runner up phone
i would love to swipe all the phones down the table
Y
T
me watching on my s10e like <br>😃
Catch you guys in the next one. PISS :v
On the clip of the asus rig phone he had the pewdiepie headphones in the backround
Just look at &#39;em<br>What&#39;s the price though? 💸💸💸
My grandmother has the galaxy s20 and I have only the iPhone 6s which isn’t even on this list
I have mine since launch and I can still say the OnePlus 7 pro is a rlly good phone in 2020
Google Pixl 4 deserves the  est of the year, that smartphone was awful when it came out and I still think about it
Will you give me a phone one phone പ്ലീസ്
Oneplus 7t in India comes for Approximately 450$
Bought one plus 7t today and immediately click this video and happy to see my 7T also included in this video 💓💓💗 loving my 7T. Oxygen is is love
I think you should have given the compact phone award to the Note 10. It has better battery just a few grams more. Huge screen and really good looking.
Who else tried guessing the awards
He literally showed up in a suit . Bravo
All those phones are more expensive than my phone. Im watching on a j3 emerge.
And Im still using the Pocophone f1.
Dude. Im strugling here in china with broken iphone 7 phone. i wish u give away me one of those phones. peace
Still agree with almost all of these
The best camera phone is iPhone SE
please do for 2020 also ... i knw its been the worst year but evn thn
OnePlus 7 Pro is that guy in the party who stays quiet for the most part but takes home the party queen
Imagine this being a full-fledged even with thousands of people attending it and cheering and laughing as the phones are picked and awarded. (since he has 5.6M views in Youtube, 1k attendees isnt a big number)
Im eyeing Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and Apple to see what they come up with in 2021
So we just gonna ignore those random legs at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=787">13:07</a>
Nice sute
So much fucking money just laying there on the table.. Jesus..
Oscar and Emmy: we are the best awards <br>Marques: hold my 🚽
&quot;Did you win an award?&quot;<br><br>Google Pixel 4: Well yes but actually no
how many phones do u have?
I&#39;m a OnePlus fan but I really think that the note 10 is a really good army knife phone
hes committed to this. he makes trophies for phones
When I click the video and got my first glance at the trophies, I wonder, <br><br><br><br><br><br>Why is there a toilet trophy?
اس چینل کو سبسکراب کریں اور میرے چینل کی کسی وﮈیو پر کمنٹ اور اپنا چینل سبسکراب کرواۓ <br>                                <br>نوٹ:<br>         اگر میں online نہ ہو تو تھوڑا انتظار کریں میں آپ کا چینل ضرور سبسکراب کرو گا
Please stop talking about the headphone jack. It is the most useless feature on any phone in 2019/2020. Please stop whining about the headphone jack ever again... pls
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=320">05:20</a> yeeeyeeyeyeyeyayyaaaay💨🙌
Splish splash your opinion is trash
I went from a Oneplus 6 to the 8 a couple months ago.  I was so underwhelmed with the 8 that I just picked up an iPhone 11 Pro Max yesterday and I will not be going back.
awe I wonder if qwerty keyboards in smartphone will ever comeback
There must be speed up function in audios and video for iPhone
There must be speed up function in audios and video for iPhone
The bust of the year should have been the royole flexpai
You should&#39;ve included Xiaomi devices too
I wonder if any of the companies actually ask for the trophy
Using the OnePlus 7pro and am proud of my phone🔥🔥
Ahh..did I just attend an award night😮
I want a desk like that
Me watching this on my one plus 7 pr0
Would be nice if a phone that won so many awards, the ROG2, was more widely available, even after this it still remained elusive.
This year the best budget phone should be the se 2020.
I droped my iphone 11 in the toilet 🤙😓😨😭😭😤😤😤😢😰😥😡📲💸💸💸💧
Why his videos are recomended at a worst time..😡
MVP:<br>2016: OP3<br>2018 : OP6t<br>2019 : OP 7pro
Any phone with &#39;royal (Royole)&#39; and &#39;pie (Pi)&#39; in it, deserves to be runner up... everything!
Best budget phone is the Realme x2 pro
Sony xperia 1 should have won the most improved award
iPhone is trash
I hope Samsung makes more flagship compact phones in future.
Hope you&#39;ll test one of Nokia&#39;s flagship phones next time.
Really weird how you picked iphone as best camera phone when some other phones absolutely kill it in camera quality.
iPhone 11 Pro Max battery life???? It’s insane
Asus user here😎♥️🤘
Im here in 2020 cuz my dad is letting me pick almost any phone i want<br><br>Edit:i got the tcl 10 pro with jbl buds.there like airpod pros but better
In highschool, if you ain&#39;t got an iPhone then you already losted
only problem with pixel 3a is that they changed the form factor. only found that out after buying it
Im so glad I got the asus rog phone 2. Worth it!!!. Waiting for the next upgrade this year.. rog phone 3 👀
When the budget phone is out of your budget 😢
can I have one of these phones please? 🥺
What about black shark 2?
Fantastic video!
Bro
Watch later it&#39;s better for you all
i hope you donate most of the phones to people who actually need one. or sell them and give some of the cash to a fund. love your work. keep doing good things kid
Why the oneplus 7 pro  and not the oneplus 7T pro?
I want to see someone rob him and see everything
The best compact phone i have ever had is the samsung a40
Asus is doing something right though, since if the new gaming phones coming out this summer will be way out of my budget (about 1k euros), I&#39;ll still want to buy the ROG phone 2, because it has so many great accessories, and I already love ASUS laptops (have an ROG and a regular one). Or I&#39;m hoping that some of the competitors that bring cheaper phones for gaming will step up their accessories game.
Has anybody else experienced wifi issues with their Huawei p20 lite?
This is so biased to Apple like it&#39;s proven how bad they are I use to own a apple never got refund even though it broke with in 24 hrs
Perfect video😎
I agree they did rush the royal flexpie, quite bad really
Geez all those phones 😍
wheres huaweis mention smh.
Budget phone $299 thats cheap?<br>me in syria getting 16$ a month
anyone else notice how he&#39;s just glancing at the winner before he announces it lmao
Marques, I really respect your work.  BUT, I think you missed the call on the ASUS ROG Phone 2.<br><br>Frankly, I just don&#39;t understand how you can give <b>THREE</b> awards to a phone that is GSM only.  This means it can only be used on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile (and other, regional, companies that use GSM and/or share AT&amp;T and T-Mobile&#39;s networks) here in the US. <br><br>There is literally about 1/2 of smartphone users in the US that use CDMA-based networks (i.e. Verizon and, for another couple years, Sprint).  Picking a phone that the rest of us can&#39;t use without a network change is, IMO, unreasonable.<br><br>I don&#39;t question your choice based on specs or usability.  IT LOOKS AWESOME!  Unfortunately, waving a phone around, winning three awards that almost 1/2 of your audience can&#39;t even use, is not right.  An honorable mention I can understand.  But winner in all of those categories?<br><br>Heck, you might as well start reviewing/including Asian and European only phones so you can tick off all of us US watchers! <br><br>OK, I&#39;m giving you a hard time (mostly), but could you limit your award winners to only those phones that are available to (almost) all of your viewers?<br><br>Thanks!
great boss
You are taking money from apple bro! No doubt
I want the rog so bad 🥺
Marques is a man of culture. I see that Logic Incredible True Story vinyl you got in the background &lt;3
I was looking everywhere for a complete guide in choosing the best phone to buy and I&#39;d say this is it. Thanks and more power!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=532">8:52</a> he has all the best phones but doesn’t have the best wifi😭😭😭
You look Good..
I wonder if he heard about the huawei nova 5t. 🤔
I&#39;m Okay with my S7 Edge.
Me watching on ipad pro 2
I really hope there will be a successor to the s10e - in my opinion it is really the only high-end android smartphone and i don&#39;t know why there&#39;s nothing like it
I’m getting this year to try the Samsung galaxy s10e
I love the google pixel 4 its amazing
ع
Watching this in 2020 cuz some of these will be this year&#39;s flagship killer
I had a Pixel 2Xl stopped charging after I dropped it in a puddle a month after I bought it. To their credit google sent me a new one. Today after jogging in a thunder storm the phone won&#39;t charge :(.
Dude.. smile a little .. work on ur acting skills
Hello Marques.. Hope you doing well in this pandemic.. I just needed an advice.... If budget is not a problem then which smartphone do you think i should go for?priority  -camera nd battery... <br> Huawei p40 pro camera looked good bt video seemed.. average<br>Is Samsung s20+ camera better than huawei? How about the new oppo find x2/? <br>Which device u think is best for camera nd battery back up.... (Nb- I dnt like warmer tone images..)
my man know whats the best i have 1+ 7T Pro it wasnt even that expensive, you deserv my sub. surprisingly you know your shit.
changed ur apple watch strap mid video. noticed second time i watched this video
You should do a non-award top phones from mid 2020
Hello sir am a little confused what&#39;s a flagship phone ??<br>I don&#39;t really knw what it means
The &quot;budget&quot; phone in usa or europe is high end phones here in the philippines i would like a budget gaming phone but its expensive here in philippines unlucky
So Marques how many awards do you want to give to the Asus ROG Phone? <br>Marques: Yes
Everyone is a gangster until the real gangster arrives oneplus 7 pro 😄🔥🔥🔥
I was waiting for him to mention the one plus 7 pro, then I was getting all disappointed, sunddenly he&#39;s like, winner best smartphone of the year - one plus 7 pro, I was like🙁😕😧😦😮😄😃
I&#39;m so glad I just picked up my one plus 7 pro for 450 dollars today! Its freaking amazing
Have u ever seen p40 pro camera?<br>Mrwhoseboss has so clear and exact comparison between s20 ultra 11pro max and p40 pro
I’m kinda curious at which companies actually asked for the awards....
I know it&#39;s personal opinion but would have to disagree with the Fold winning on design. Foldable smartphones are still not ready yet and that thing is ugly, especially when folded. What it is, however, is the best proof of concept we&#39;ve seen for foldables. It shows we likely will get there one day but it is still a long way off yet. Maybe another decade. Half at least.
So the pictures feel more confident huh 🤔
And welcome back to... THE PHONIES
Remove your hair and you will be kobe
Hagaha
Are you kobe?
I am unable to catch his thoughts when he says the best budget phone under 300 bucks . Where mine is just a $$$250 and feelin expensive
Lol my over here chilling on my 2015 iPhone 6s
Mkbhd: so the best budget phone is....<br>Me: ur budget ain&#39;t ma budget man
saw this on my recommended just now and almost thought he was doing a 2020 one in June because he knows the world about to end anyway
I wanna hear more about what the best secure phones are, i.e. phones with strong capabilities as well as strong security features.
Most budget phone of 2020 is the you guessed it somehow it’s the se 2, now somehow Apple made a cheap phoen
My life’s worth just chillin on a table
Was 2018 the most viewed smartphone awards because one plus dethroned the note as mvp. 👏🤔
These are all paid pormotions google<br>Pixel 4 has the best camera in camparison to iphone 11 pro he is fake
What about the s10+ 😭😭😭
Sir you are very rich and have lot of phone so I beg you can you give iphone 12 pro max or iPhone 11 pro max please😢
All I could think about is the companies watching this video and just going “please please please please please” and then google is sitting there on the bust just going “Nono onononononono” and then it pops up and they just like 😐
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=84">1:24</a> anyone notice those PewDiePie headphones in the back
Bhai ek mujhe dedo gareeb ko
I just bought my mom a iPhone 11 Pro without watching the video first
Marques: “You already know what I’m talking about~” <br><br>Me: <b>new to the tech review YouTube community</b> “...yeah” 👁👄👁
GREAT VIDEO....
Should just call this the samsung and apple awards
Iphone se on there please
Note 10+ should have been rewarded   as MVP and most completed phone category
Giveaway please!😁👏
lol I wish to have iPhone 11pro 😓😓
Looking sharp mark
Who thought that at the top of the screen in the background was something on there phone 😂😡
totally bullshit just like all your other videos,it is not a surprise because you know shit about mobiles
I&#39;m subscribing had because if an the runner ups. Love it. My runner up to the runner up, runner up is... I&#39;m subscribing
Watching this the day after ordering the MVP not knowing it was given that award. So excited!
Most of the phones are laying just idle😂😂 uh should giveaway that one.
Pixel 3a🤩😍😛
oh to be called the best smartphone of the year by marques...
I wish he could let me pick and take home
Oh mate come on come on OnePlus 7T is the best phone of 2019-2020 by far
can you include gaming phones like the redmagic 5g etc in 2020? pls🙏🏼
all the dislikes came from the pissed apple fans
Samsung s10e is really the best compact <br>Really suit me since i can use it in one hand<br>Whose with me
since yall r some really techsavvy people then if someone sees this then should I buy the s20 ,note 10 both base model or the iphone 11
pls do a review on the huawei mate xs
Waiting for the phones acceptance speeches...
I&#39;d like to know where  the p30 Pro would stand in comparison to these? as your review of it was great.
I have a OnePlus 7 Pro :D
He even bought trophies for them<br><br><b>Dedication</b>
I thought one of the honourable mentions for the best camera would’ve been the Asus ZenFone 6.
i remember going on a shop to look at the new phones and i fell in love with s10e. i can&#39;t afford it that time, but now i can and i&#39;m just waiting for it to arrive at our home. now i&#39;m watching this knowing that s10e will be picked as the Best Compact Phone. yes!
No K20 Pro in Australia. And the prices of all the phones vary worldwide, which might factor into the results. BTW, when he says Pixel 3a, he probably means Pixel 3a XL.
Here are the best smartphones of every smartphone award so far if you wanna know.......<br><br><br><br>2014= Htc one M8<br>2015= Nexus 6p<br>2016= Google pixel xl<br>2017= Galaxy note 8<br>2018= One plus 6T<br>2019= One plus 7 pro<br>=================<br>Htc- 1 MVP<br>Nexus-1 MVP<br>Google- 1 MVP<br>Samsung- 1 MVP<br>One plus- 2 MVP<br><br>         Best Smartphone company of the last      <br>          5 years = One plus
samsung
When the budget phone is $300 😳😳 he called me broke in 50 different languages
look at all those phones man
They&#39;re all the same to me. Just glass app slabs. They all do the same shit.
Really loved the video
I&#39;m so bummed I&#39;m poor cause that fuckin note 10 plus is gorgeous.. My word. Wtf they gotta be charging like 1500 now! I wonder if a few gens into 5g on the hardware level this will start to level back out 💵-wise?<br><br><br>And totally agree on the pixle 4. The craziest part was that awful battery.. I could have lived with everything but that. Bad battery is a nightmare it doesn&#39;t matter how good a phone is if you are always paranoid about it dying.
Galaxy a50?
Us note 10 plus owners know what phone is the best................
Wtf why can the oneplus 7 pro be the smartphone of the year but then not win any awards. Stupid asf.
Super VOOC!
iPhone 11 Pro should have been over the s10e
Marcus forgot realme x2 pro
According to battery I think huawei should be there in list.
One plus is always The Best
I&#39;ve spent a lot of time choosing the right smartphone in 2019 and bought the One Plus 7 Pro in China :) So, glad to see now that it was the right choice. I am using the phone for almost a year now and pretty happy with everything. Yes, it has not the best cam, but the Google Camera can help. Overall it is really a good device.
This video should be so boring, but somehow i can&#39;t stop watching. Great job, marques
Hey Marque, what do you suggest of phone with glvery good camera but like 300 dollars price?
Review moto one hyper
Best vid of the year
Imagine, successfully completing 25 min video and he realised that he had forgotten to press record button
my question is which the best camera for mid end price and high end price?
Moto 1 Hyper review please.
@Marques Brownlee : has any manufacturer ever asked you to ship their award ?     Just curious if so , who ? (If you are able to mention them).    Thank you for your content . I appreciate you fair handed approach in your vids without drama and overhype . Thank you for this .    Stay safe 😊👍
Oppo find x has an amazing battery, seems to never die on me.
Rog phone is a gaming phone and tbh most of us wont even buy🙄 only for those hardcore gamers. Should have been the Note 10+
Most of these phones have more Ram than i have hard drive.
I am confused between One Plus 7 and Realme x2? please suggest

If marcques reviwed the Realme X2 pro it will be the best budget phone of 2019🤗
Waiting for 2020
Please do a 2020 one, when 2020 has ended :)

I think now looking at this in 2020, Marques should give sony another try!
Did anyone else also realise that he had at least 3 iPhone 11 Pro/ Pro Max on his desk?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=397">6:37</a> just like brother and sister
I feel bad for his cousins and shit who get compared to him
Got almost all of them right
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=1275">21:15</a> Ngl feels great hearing the 7pro got smartphone of the year for 2019. Even in 2020, still solid. Just picked one up 2 weeks ago and honestly it really is the best damn phone ive ever used, hands down. Price to performance is massive for the 7pro, especially with it being only $450 at tmobile for the 256 storage/8gb ram model, which is just beyond me. <br><br><br>I almost feel like they made a mistake with the pricing 😂 Too good to be true.
If the Royale flex pie had more bad decisions than the Pixel 4 shouldn&#39;t the flex pie be the dump/the bust of the year phone and the pixel 4 would be the runner up
Tbh I thought the best camera phone would go one of the Huawei P30 or P30 pro or the Mate 30 but the iPhone 11 pro and 11 pro Max for the award was also a great decision
Why don&#39;t u have a best gaming phone category also I like ur custom awards
I like these vids don&#39;t stop doing them also I want an Asus ROG Phone 3 with everything better and with 5G for 2020 or 2021 also I feel like that Asus should be making more Smartphones anyone else feel like that
&quot;7T&quot; &quot;700 dollars&quot;<br><br><br>wat
Just think he gave the “bust of the year” award to google pixel 4 and uploaded that video on platform owned by google
No wireless charging wins the MVP..... Lol :-)

Moto 1 hyper review
Strange for not finding huawei mobiles even on table
Compact phones all the way
😒
Bro... you have all these phones?? Where do you keep them??
anyone just see the skateboard
Oh boy i guessed it all
God damn it i hate it when the time comes for a new phone... I dropped my S8+ for the 3,000 time and now the screen as a very fine crack, but I now I need to start looking for a new one. I cant go iPhone because they don&#39;t have a back button and that shit is unacceptable.
Always come to you when I need a new phone. which is every year. I haven’t phone a phone that last 3 years. I buy a phone, thinking it’s great but something isn’t what I wanted. I have the S8. Bought it last year, the camera is hit. <br>I want a phone with good camera, expandable space, good battery, and headphone jack!
not a single lg phone
In your opinion, what is the best Mobile phone for vlogging?
lol
Its a shame he didnt even mention the <br>S10+
Big phone energy
I just ordered the Google pixel 4xl from google few days ago still waiting for it to ship but I have heard a lot of good things about the phone and my friends cousin has one and he says he loves it and I have not heard one negative thing about the phone besides where the antenna bands are placed google kinda choose a bad spot for them
Smartphone Awards 2020:-<br>MVP = Oneplus 8 Pro
pixel is trash.....even the name is trash<br>LOVE LIVE THE KING. ( APPLE )
Nice
Hey aren’t you friends with Justine?
Can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m bored with phones. When are we getting hard light keyboards?
😂😂 all of the Android phones should be #1 for worse phone of the year<br>If you don&#39;t like You&#39;re stupid, gay and like stupid Android phone
MKBHD: &quot;but hey it&#39;s my show so I can be bias&quot;<br>YouTube on the Rewind: &quot;that&#39;s my line&quot;
Obviously you&#39;re an apple fanboy. Also you like to promote American phones. Too bad.
&quot;Best camera of the year goes to iPhone 11 pro&quot;.  Here we go feeding the ego of Apple fans yet again.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=1439">23:59</a> my mom have bought yestarday
Is K20 Pro and Mi 9T the same phone?
Interesting content.<br><br>New subscriber here. 🤟🏻
😂 the s10 got absolutely nothing
I think the overall. Award should have been given to iphone 11 pr
Most fugly phone award goes to ROG Asus
Wow you have soo many phones. So I have a samsung galaxy s7 lol. Are you in business of selling those phones? Or do you return them to the manufacturer?
What about Huawei? Not even 1 award? 🤔
I&#39;d like to think that OnePlus watched this video and thought to themselves &quot;welp, we&#39;ve become the flagship killers now so why not raise our prices and become flagships ourselves&quot;
It&#39;s kinda not fare for samsung S series as it comes in the start of the year
Have I missed it or did he forget to film the close-up shot of the phone of the year trophy?
Nice
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
MKBHD: <b>doesn&#39;t give awards to lots of phones on table*</b><br>Me- Gimme one of em&#39;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
S10E gang where you at???🔥🔥🔥
What about the Samsung a series phones???
Yo, man , can i have one of these phones
Mark ass brownie
All awards goes to Samsung because they paid me a lot for this shity and laying session👍👍👍👍👍👍

Who came here just to see if their favourite smartphone brand was in here?
Can mvp smartphone also best in security
Amazing categorised of smartphones but what about security
Just bought a used OnePlus 7 pro for $400, great phone
You Sound like the white voice in sorry to bother you.
Imagine watching this video on a google pixel
I was thinking oh shit preety bad year for OnePlus and just 5 second later <br>I was like:-<br>Wait a minute...!😯<br><br>( I was thinking overall winner will be the 11 pro max or S10 plus)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=171">2:51</a><br><br><br>He tricked me of thinking he is going to choose a phone from the right-side of the screen.
Dea @MKBHD, U forgot to mention the realme X2 pro, which is way better than the budget range winner..
On the camera department, i think the huawei mate 30 pro should have placed better.<br><br><br>Btw: fair awards.
iPhone Pro/Pro Max should’ve been the MVP.
What&#39;s up with LG V50
Next time...you might want to glue them phones behind you on a white board....it might look cool ..just a suggestion
watching this with my one plus 7 pro 💯
He was saying that in America OnePlus 7T starts at $700 , but I bought it for $450 dollar on 20 November 2019 (in india) 😎😎😎.
The pixels 1 was hated because of the useless chin at the bottom, the pixel 4 is hated cause the chin on top
Got the MVP OnePlus 7 pro for just $450 last week
man all i want is a proper 5&#39;&#39; size phone including the entire body. not iphones new SE with 4.7&#39;&#39; display but the body is the size of a modern 5.7/5.8&#39;&#39; phone where the entire front is a screen.... 5.8 is not compact  :/
Asus rog phone2. Bought one and doesn&#39;t work for Verizon.
Redmagic 5g : <b>allow me to introduce to myself</b>
Hi bro. Galaxy s10e, oppo reno ace, both aren’t available here in saudi. Pls bring middle east version of this vid pls :)   I’m looking for a mid range smartphone. My pixel 2 xl chipped an unable to get it fixed :/  (my preference is same as you, camera!) but i hate lags
Waawoo
Is it my eyes? or am I the only one who noticed that the most ugly phone won 3 awards
When he was talking about the worst phone was I the only one who was imagining that the phones were listening???<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>no? ok only me :(
Why do i feel like him watching malik in ELITE
i dont see how iphone got best camera, as long as i can remember they have had shit cameras compared to flag ship Samsung / android devices
Middle child iphone 11 shout out to j. Cole
nice choice oneplus 7 pro best
I watched this on a OnePlus 7 Pro.<br>One recommendation for wired headphone users, don&#39;t bother with the official headphone adaptor, get a high end one, such as the one I use from Tempotec
how much the iphone 11 pro max i just want to buy.
Best display?
Where ma people who be crushin&#39; on him?
Before you know it, 5 years later they’ll be shoving a quantum supercomputer into a smartphone
asus rog phone is really a good phone
So the s10+ didn&#39;t win anything 🤔 category....something is wrong somewhere
Awesome, video that had to watch again 😉👌✌Deb 2020
Who’s watching this in 2020?<br>Like if u agree!
I know he’s looking around so you don’t know what phone he’s choosing but it looks like he’s just picking at random
Oneplus❤️
Oneplus💯💯💯
the hatred MKBHD has for Google/Pixel devices is unreal!
When this phone has 12g of ram and my pc has 8g :(
MVP Most Valuable Phone
Do you think you could put the prices of the phone at the time of recording for the next phone awards?
I have the Note 10 and I feel betrayed.
Oneplus 7T Pro user. What a time to be alive!
why are there never any sony phones reviewed or even looked at
I ordered my oneplus 7
What does he do with the trophies after?
I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max and I’m super happy with it, the battery life is amazing and the camera is really nice
Heh, cool I&#39;m getting the MVP
Best phone is Nokia
Sweet the phone I just bought brand new at 450 was the big award winner
proud rog phone 2 user here i also have a pocophone f1 flashed with pixel experience  😁
I clapped for every phone xD 😂
Watching from my Mi 9T Pro - A beast!!
The Galaxys&#39; were really ugly this year...<br>also, are they still doing the curved glass display? I loathed that feature so bad about them, even more then the notch on the iPhone.
Brutally honest 👍👏😁
Asus: how much money do you need to make rog the most awarded phone?<br><br><br>Marques: Yes
In your iPhone review you said that you applaud apple for not changing too much from last years phone. You said that from the iPhone X to the 11 there were very little changes and that we shouldn’t bash them for doing that. That they introduce upgrades every year so we can decide when it’s time for us to upgrade. I don’t understand why you say this with negativity when it came together the pixel 4. Maybe there’s something I’m missing and I would like to be educated on that. Are we to expect more from other companies that aren’t apple? Or are was there something promised from the pixel 4 that wasn’t delivered? I’m just curious
what do u think of the xiaomi redmi note 9s? as a budget phone
Well the pixel 4 is a bust, will the 4a be able to exceed the 3a?
How much times he mentioned about headphone jack being  important, surprise he didn&#39;t mentioned memory card slot also lol. Good job bro keep up the good work learnt a lot.
World need more compact phones. <br><br>Imagine ;<br>•5 inch/below, infinite/side punch hole camera =screen<br>•4000 mah battery<br>•4 gb Ram<br>•730G snap dragon processor<br>•128GB ROM<br>• 30watts wire power charging<br>•Audio jack<br><br>All under 400$<br><br>Heaven right?
I was regretting getting a oneplus until the final one
iPhone 11 Pro Max is a smartphone
Just bought The oneplus 7 pro on a discount, getting it in The mail in 4 days!
Kailla choda khankir pola shob awards one plus re disos!
Motorola hyper review please
I know its difficult to handle all this phones, I am still using a galaxy j2 ,and I can help you
I bought my one plus 7 pro after this video and I am so impressed with this device.
The winner should have been the OnePlus 7T pro?
it seemed to asus sponsored  video
Can i get the wallpaper on oneplus7pro in the video afte20.00 plz
always had a dream to be a host in a show one day? burn some cash and youre all set to go
Tbh oneplus is the least known phone,if I where him I would give the award to note 10
Can you please give any one phone of your choice to me please please
Sequel Smartphones released: Get awards<br>OG Smartphones : Am I a joke to you<br>( sequel smartphones are like Galaxy Note, Huawei Mate and OnePlus T while OG smartphones are Galaxy S, Huawei P and OnePlus normal )
Why don&#39;t you include realme x2pro as a low budget phone ofcourse it&#39;s a much better phone than k20pro... I think so!!
feeling proud of my phone winning 3 awards.didn&#39;t win the MVP but that&#39;s ok.
Imagine not having 4K 60 on a smartphone in 2019 and/or 2020
That ROG shoud not be included.
Redmi k 20 pro is Redmi 9t pro?
OP7T or Huawei P30 Pro?? pls helpp
OP 7 Pro YEAH!!!
I don’t even have a phone...😅 I just want a iPod 7th gen for my b-day
What about the best display phone
me still using xioami mi A1 and finding what to buy for my next phone. not disappointed..
Nice video.  Anyone interested in savings, technology, check out my check.
What about a best small phone?
Plot twist he was trying to flex on us
So you telling me I could&#39;ve bout either s10+ or note 10+ and I chose the S ? I feel dumb
omgg are you going to give that away to your followers ? 🙏🙏🙏😆
ONE+ 7PRO is really great phone. Respect ONE+ 💙
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=860">14:20</a> 700 $ mark u got scammed 😂😂
Watching on my ONEPLUS 7PRO ❤️
That was awesome, with some unpredictable nominees and winners of course!<br>I like your as much (as much as possible) non-bios approach through the entire industry and manufacturers.<br>However, I didn&#39;t see any NOKIA on your table. have you not tested them in 2019?
ROG phone smashed it with it&#39;s car battery
I hope those phones get recycled responsibly, one person can never use that quantity  or justify owning.
When you don&#39;t watch billboard awards anymore but smartphone awards :/
Non of them accepted those awards ...
did u send trophies too company hq??
My MVP Rog 2
I can sense some modren &quot;fairness&quot; at work,   For freaking cell phones !?! - whats this world coming too.  Good job on the research &amp; editing, but honestly its all distugsting.
You awarded Pixel 4 for best camera?<br>I think this award is a big joke.
Woo hoo! I bought an S10e and I knew it was better compared to it&#39;s bigger brothers. So glad someone agreed with me.
Yo what about s10+
My phone got bust of the year 😂 it&#39;s really not that bad but it&#39;s definitely not leading the way.
I own the pixel 3a xl and it is a horrible phone worse phone I ever had it don&#39;t deserve no reward
Every single phone here has more ram than my computer
I think there should be an award for Best Display/Screen.<br>I agree that OnePlus 7 Pro should be Smartphone of the year but it should of won some other awards too. To me the smartphone of the year has to win some of the other awards too.
I own a pixel....Why!!!!!
I hate it there&#39;s no S20e. Or S20 mini of whatever. S10e has really a great size.
Can you please give me a phone please I love you 😋😍😘😍😘😍
Imagine they make a phone that has<br>iphones camera<br>samsungs performance<br>nokias build quality
K20 pro gang where u at?
No say about s10 plus?<br>P30 pro?
Me with my Samsung galaxy S10e: yay
&quot;Runner up for most improve-<br>iphone 11 pro&quot; dude they just add a camera or some no use specs and double the price....thats improvement??
and i just ordered a pixel 4 xl LMAO lol i guess ill see this is mostly all subjective anyways
yeah
Muy bueno abrazo🇦🇷🤙🤙🤙
Best smartphone of the year Oneplus 7 pro . Thats the bad decision you make ....(no wireless charging)<br>In my opinion Galaxy note 10+  and iPhone 11 pro max......
I like the over all value you get from 🏆OnePlus+ 7Pro with the QHD AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate.  Another key point I really like about this phone it has dual SIM cards fantastic for traveling, I leave a international card in one SIM slot and the other SIM slot for my service provider.
wow!!its one plus 7 pro is the best smartphone of the year!! its the phone that i am planning to buy!!
I just had the Samsung S20+ and sold it after 2 days and went back to my OnePlus 7 Pro still a million times better than anything out there .
Mad that my boi Zenfone 6 didn&#39;t win the best big phone with huge batteries and headphone jack.
best compact phone is nokia 3310
Everyone when flexing: Airpods<br>Marques Brownlee when flexing: Making a trophe for his smartphones
Omg its a lot phone you have😭
Been Rocking With My IPhone XSMAX Past 18 Months Now. I Just Bought That Note 10 Plus For My Late Birthday Gift 😅 I’m A Few Months Late To The Note 10 Party 🎉 But I Mad It 😂 Now My IPhone XS MAX My Back Up Phone On My Main Phone.. 🤷🏾‍♂️
I dare everybody that reads this to find a deference between iPhone 11 pro and iPhone 11 pro max
Watching this on my s10plus, confident it was gonna get an award somewhere...
This guy change phone more frequently than his clothes.
Multi Task award for next year. I also think note 10 plus is underrated.
He made trophies for his phones? haha
I use a OnePlus 7 Pro🥰❤️❤️
And I have a bellyache
Have you seen the Moto one action? Pretty sure it came out in 2019 I might be wrong but I just picked it up for 300 bucks and it is the best phone I have ever personally owned! From features to camera to sound to build quality to screen, it doesn&#39;t miss. Plus it runs pie and at that price point, you can&#39;t beat it.
He just picked some random bad and ugly looking phone.they look like crap. The S10 +obviously won
When you said google pixal 4 it trigged my google home...
Bruh gave budget smartphone award to K20 pro, he doesn&#39;t knows about Realme x2 pro!😂😭
p30 pro though
Hi Marques! can you make a video about the top 10 best internal mic phones?
One plus 7 pro.    Me: 8
Hello sir, all your video are very important for me . Love
What is the fullform of MVP?
Give away
Wow
It would be more entertaining if they had Acceptance speech
Can you please do a IPad awards
I will be back in 2025
I am a  boy from bd
Great reviews! I am actually not into gaming. I am looking for an all around less than USD1,000 reliable quality phone with technology that can last for say two to three years. What would be your professional recommendation?
Sir can I have one please? :)
The winners for the camera are very questionable.
Google be taking hella L’s in 2019 and 2020.
Brother please give me one of those ..,❤️
Why this Monsters don&#39;t put all the great features in one phone and sell at a budget price.<br>I&#39;m sure they all can&#39;t fit in my pocket
He&#39;s literally searching the phone...😂😂
Awesome, you are taking these reviews in a next stage of industry. A step forward as a certification not actually certification but a seal with trusted. Keep it up 👍
Me starting to think he is biast to apple<br>Him: the improvements WE&#39;VE made this year
the best budget phone must go to realme x2 pro :<br>90hz<br>sd855+<br>4000mah<br>50 w charge fully in 30 min!!<br>and trimple camera :<br>64mp /12mp\8mp/2mp<br>all that for350$
Normal people watch porn...<br>Marques brownlee watches phone reviews
I&#39;m comment by 1+ 7t pro should i try note 10+ run Snapdragon I&#39;m very considering 1sim and the version Hongkong it has 2sim snap but over price -.-
Definition of a budget phone is $100 max!
Waiting all the way for One Plus 7 pro to get an award...  But it got for the best🤣
Yo did google ever decide to pick their award up??  😂
realme x2 pro is the best budget phone with flagship processor SD 855+
Do you give away
&#39;&#39;best of the year&quot; IPHONE 11
Quality quarantine content
When Smart Phone companies release a phone right after the smartphone awards:<br>Smartphone companies, We were too late<br>iPhone 12 launches<br>Smartphone companies, Nevermind
Oneplus are the smuthest. Phone in the world💪🏻
Iphone are for Lusers
Iphone 11 pro max has not night mode and not work in night🤬
i will love to get one.
I put the like button after seeing the intro which was so amazing.remaining video is watching later...huge collection u have💞❤
If it was on best smart phone on 2020 definitely samsung s20 ultra will win all of the nominations
I wish android wasn’t a thing, and phone companies made their own OS
been a one plus user since 2015 haha &lt;3
I thought the Google Pixel 4 would easily win the best camera award, plus it has a 12.2 megapixel sensor
You gave the phone MVP award to a phone that:<br>1) Does not have the capability of turning into a full working desktop (Dex)<br>2) Does not even offer any extra features that stand out among the rest (bluetooth s pen)<br>3) performs at par or less than normal flagship phones<br><br>To top it all, you give the runner up award to a phone that doesn&#39;t really have any care for any kind of innovation. <br><br>Lame way of determining your MVP award. Yes not all are capable of buying high end and pricey phones but if we settle for phones that doesn&#39;t even care to innovate and offer more, why will any tech even exist? Innovation will dies in the process
can you give me one,
Yo....what is I-PHONE and Samsung paying all your bills or something? That&#39;s all you have on the table. They are the only phones that you give good scores to. What the hell is this??
One plus 7 Pro is LEGIT a phone with the fastest UI
I have an A50
Wrong. Best phone are the Chinese companies that copy the apple phones but they run android 9.
The iPhone 11pro Max has the BEST battery in my opinion. With normal use this phone batter will easily last almost 2 days. I kid you not. I have the phone and the battery is incredible.
huawei mate 30 has best camera
do you do a tablet version of this and if so would you ever or do you feel like there just would not be enough tablets to do so
SERIOUSLY I was about to buy a google pixel 4
To be honest I don&#39;t care about the headphone Jack
GIMME A PHONE PWEASE
Iphone 1<br>Rog phone 2 3<br>Samsung 2 <br>Mi 1 awards
And then there is me with no phone!!
Why are there two iPhone 11’s on the right?
I like how you put time stamps.👍
I Wish I could buy all of these phones all of them are amazing

So is the meaning of MVP Most Valuable Player or Most Valuable Phone?
Ik I&#39;m 3 months late but pleeeeeas review the 2020 galaxy a51
S10E or Pixel 3A for use in 2020???
Why isnt the samsung galsxy a80 there
XIAOMI BLACK SHARK 2
Damn it, I got the OnePlus 7T Pro a week ago
It should be &#39; PREMIUM SMARTPHONE AWARDS &#39;
Give me one phone pls
Iphones are overrated
What really stuck out to me were how similar they all look. Back in the 90&#39;s to mid 00&#39;s there was so much variety, so different styles, sizes, and shapes. Now, they&#39;re all rectangles with touch screens on one side and cameras on the other? Goes to show how much we&#39;re all just sheep. We don&#39;t want to be special, we just want to fit in, we don&#39;t want freedom, we want to be controlled.
YOU SUCK!
Summary, let’s goo android.
Where is Nokia?? loved the video , Nokia hehe
damn i was getting disappointed with this video untill ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=1248">20:48</a> ) this part came 🙏🏻🤍
Lmao wow apple lover
Lmao when you repeat yourself 30 times to stretch the video out.
Razer Arctech Pro this phone is worth a look.
Sorry, gotta disagree on the battery life. The Moto G series can go up as high as 2.5 days battery life.
I&#39;m kinda proud of my Note10+ now, being mentioned several times is a good feeling :D
2018: Note 9 has a 6-inch screen 2019: ROG phone 2  has Snapdragon 855
The Camera one I think you gotta give it to the Galaxy S10 and S10+
And the nomineesss are.......😂😂😂!!!!!!?
O N E P L U S   7   P R O
Can u giveaway the iPhone 11 pro max to me?
One plus 7 pro is a beast. Watching this on my almond version!
Smartphone awards 2020?
ROG is real Flagship killer this year😍❤️
ماشاء اللہ MASHA ALLAH
Viewing this on my 100 euro honor phone.
Please give us the review  on the mate 30 pro please
Thanks for giving me a good suggestion to buy an excellent phone ,
Omg its so funny,i have the one plus 7 pro and im watching this video and i saw how my phone didnt get any trophy, i wasnt sad or something but i still thought &quot;not even 1 trophy?&quot; And then at the end,the last and &quot;biggest&quot; trophy was for the one plus 7 pro😂😂
Plzz give me a phone
what do you do with this phones after the video? I wouldn&#39;t mind one if you ever feel sufficiently philanthropic. Thank you.
Thank you so much for making our decision for picking up best phone  so easy MKBHD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=473">7:53</a> What about the Energizer Power Max P18K?
I think the oneplus 7 pro should’ve at least got a mention in the design category.
I can&#39;t believe the regular galaxy s10 got left out
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnwUz-I2GI&amp;t=1465">24:25</a> There’s a little something for everyone.
bruh the redmi k20pro is 600 euro where i live wtf
These are 25 minute preludes to calling the latest oneplus the smartphone of the year. I love it.
On may 24th 2020 i am getting a google pixel 3a aaahahahahahaha i can&#39;t wait !!!!!!!!!!
My baby pixel 3a took home the most runner ups. Hope the 4a gets at least one real award this year!
This whole time I was like oh ok Oneplus ain&#39;t that great...
I thought he will give realme x2pro the budget phone.😕😕
sanaol
