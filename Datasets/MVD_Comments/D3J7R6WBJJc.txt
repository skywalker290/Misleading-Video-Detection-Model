I’m the first to comment in Monday 4 March 2024
What is called the system that used a similar principle for increasing grip in motorcycles?
I’m the first to comment in 2024
¿Y cuánto va a costar los cargadores de CO2?
Who is watching this in 2024!!!
8 years later, I’m using 14 Pro Max and the only thing that needs parachute is the prices…
How it started - iPhone 7 with parachute system<br><br>How it ended - iPhone 7 without headphone jack
Co2 cost $200
Who is waching in dec 2023.. 😂 making fool
Space x program using those tech now
The new iPhone with parachute technology. Coming Fall 2125.
Iphone 7 original release- we removed headphone jack
I can confirm that this is not the real iphone6😡😡😡
With headphone jack 🤑
We gotta say that we were all thinking a parachute was about to come out of that damn phone lol
That is something they should actually add
I think Samsung and Apple should add this? (I think it will be hard) oh and btw thr hole for the gas will take all water resisiltance out
the charging port: am i an joke to you?
Lets hope its gonna be at iPhone 15
Same as airbag
I watched it in 2016, 7 years ago. Now i am here again.
me: <b>*drops iphone 7*</b><br>iphone 7: <b><i>*releases CO2 to slow fall</i></b>*
Это какой то мейзу
😅
I remember watching this in schooldays being blown away 😅😂
This is crazy! You are a concept maniac!:)
Когда хотел parashute system а получил отсутствие разъёма 3,5 😂😂😂😂
<b>CO2 TANK SOLD SEPERATELY</b><br><b>PARACHUTE SYSTEM SUBSCRIPTION SOLD SEPERATELY</b>
I remember watching this as a kid and thinking this was the future.
Ok
watching this iPhone 7 ad 7 years later... noice
iphone 3310 <b>only durable for drops</b>
Fake😂
Space x phone

I’m happy
Show this to William Osman tell him to make it lmao
Haters will say &#39;Just buy a case lol&#39;
apple:<br>que le quite el cargador dice...
NO WAY!!! 11!1
This is FAKE
i hate this concept so much but at the same time i kinda like it, but what bothers me most is what if ur ona a rollercoaster?
@jeslenz
trash ahh phone😢😢🐟🐟🐟🐟🚗🚗
Cap 🧢
No I searched this up 💀
2022 no jet yet 😅
who ever thought that was real is stupid
I bet if the 7 actually had this feature android users would still be like “we had that for years”
who watch in 2077?
Would&#39;nt it be better if it just hovered until you grabbed it?
We now have a crash detection 😂
Wtf the lies tho
I’m still waitin’ to this phone’s release
AAAAA
IPHONE 14 SEPTEMBER 2022
Tus conceptos siguen siendo mejor que el iPhone 14 que ayer se presentó
Your imagination is beyond iPhone
🤣🤣🤣
I remember believing this
Wow hahaha
I can’t wait to try this out
accidentistical drop saver
Plz bgm name
Imagine if the iphone 7 actually turned out like that
We all believed these
STILL NO SPACE FOR A HEDPHONE JACK
that CO2 thing is Co2 charge
CO2
Ben yaptım..
Chuppu h tu

a đù khét
Help 💀, Today my teacher said that this phone exists

Vengo del futuro , aventé mi cell de la cama y se estrelló
Ya salió???
2022/23
This design is possible but if you forget to put gas in you might accidently break your phone
Yay it has a headphone jack!
vengo de casi 7 años en el futuro, no viene con ese sistema el iPhone
This aged well

imagine it falling on your face
imagine getting hyped for this
The apple phones now are dogshit
😤🫤
bir zamanlar buydu aynen
guys i dont think this is real
<b>iPhone 14 coming soon</b>
We have the iPhone 13, and we don’t even have a parachuting system
Who else got this in their recommended after 6 years
Dude is that a parachute on your phone
when i was a kid i really thought this was real
😀🤣🤣🤣😅😅HILARIOUS <br>in 2022
when i was a kid, i watched this and thought that an iphone 7 actually has these features..EVEN IF IT WAS ALREADY RELEASED
6 years here..
Que pendejada
You: go to Apple and ask for another can of CO2 Apple: that will be $436 please
Anyone on 2021
Apple; iPhone 14 next year, let’s add a anti theft explosive device on it!
It’s all fun and games until the battery runs out while it’s in the air
Apple remove headphone jack then Samsung followed Samsung sucks
Apple has been doing other useless things such as removing the headphone jack
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Very bad not reale in 7or all
this wasnt even made on april fools...
him: pushes iphone off the table<br>iphone: so you have chosen death
Headphonejack xD
“Sorry, do you have any spare CO2 for my iPhone 7?”
Wow I didn’t know my iPhone 7 could do that.
recommend after 5years
the Ironman of phones!
Был у меня айф 7 ,небыло Я из 2021 . Где парашют и почему это увидел сейчас ??
people who disliked this tried to drop their phone to see if this was real and put gas in their headphone jack.
henlo i have iphonre 7 i fdrop but no parashoote system y not lier
Iphone 7 spaceX edition starting at 9999$
Futuristic iphone be like :v

THIS GUY COMES UP WITH THE BEST  IDEAS EVER
Nokia more durable and less expensive
Man, u live in 3021.
this is the coolest concept
suitable for mars
This is actually really smart but I think the phone should be more precise than the falcon 9
R.i.p to the weird design
IPHONE 7 ??? huh NOW THERE IS IPHONE 13 and that is in your imagination
Fake ..
This is a joke
This got me shitting myself. I’ll be right out I’m charging my phone’s carbon dioxide tank
wish that existed.
This guy: (recharges CO2 tank)<br>Also this guy: (immediately wastes the CO2 he just put in)
So, they predicted Mars 2020...
- battery live
Bruh
What happens if it’s going to FaceTime religious activate and go  cracked
this is wrong
I thought there was an actual parachute...LOL
This is good 👍🏻
Imagine the screen facing the floor
Concept : masterpiece for him/her<br>Original : better

I will see it in 2100
<b>iPhone PH</b><br>8 000$
Nice concept<br>I want it in iPhone 15
You wish buddy. We on Iphone 13 and we&#39;re not close to that unfortunately. Hope that existed.
I love how the gas comes out of the headphone jack
Dont imagine ur iphone to be a rocket
割とアリそうなんがすごいｗ
I’m using an iPhone 7 and no parachute system.
i remember watching this back then and believing it
it looks like an android
Who else wishes this was real
Another 1000 IQ invention
Dang, they really just said <b>Screw you charging!</b>
XD?
Bruh they don&#39;t want to loose half their sales
Sometimes... Expectations are diffrent than reality.<br><br><br>-Some random person on the internet
Parachute : +299$<br>Parachute Pro : +469$
Lol 😂
The CO2 charger could run out
Imagine co2 release inside your pocket
Case:<br><br>Am i joke to you?
Back then people were thinking outside the box
wheres the parachute system on my iphone 12?
MY IPHONE HE STOLE IT AHHHHH
iPhone 13 ready and still no parachute system :(
iPhone 13 and still don’t got any of this
Why Apple didn’t make it :(
Can I use this?
It’s a cool idea but what if you run out of co2 gas when you are on a road trip and you forgot the co2 gas and you drop it?
We have airplane mode.
This video has 22k unlikes. What&#39;s wrong with you guys?!
Now i would carry a c02 tank anywhere i go!
Never knew spacex made phones...
Some TikTok kid got 8 million likes off this vid. 🤦🏾‍♂️
whell  i have iphone 7 and it doesnt exist
Everyone gangsta until it falls on the screen side
Well damn
Watched this when i was 6 lmao
Wow ımpossble
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dios esto es tan estupido jajaja
i remember this video i saw it when i has 6 years
No
it&#39;s  a very ok we have bomper kase
I’m so clumsy with my phones apple needs to make that a thing
Back when I was a kid I thought it was real
So why don&#39;t they have these on airplanes?
as the saying goes,<br><i>Reality is often disappointing.</i>
Lol i actully searched for this because i watcehd this video when it came out, then there were comments loke woow or i tought this is real fu. Now there are jusr memes :(
XD
im in 2021 with an iphone 12 pro and still have no parachute system
its all fun and games until it drops when there is no co2
Phone: AAAA Oh
How would you charge the phone?
i know this video is fake if this was real that will be amazing! Why they are not doin’ that?!
Oh God, 10 y/o me really believed it 5 years ago...
Maybe you should do a video on iPhone 13 cause from your point of view it may be having a car mode 🤣
Bruh i have a iPhone 7 black but mine doesn’t do that
NAMIK KEMAL
First Apple have to graduate to the memory card slot then go for space age landing phone.
People on YouTube : <b>make awesome iphone consepts</b><br>Apple : 💩💩💩 we can make this only
bruh what would happen if it fell face down and i boosted it like what would you expect a force that would be able to carry the entire phone do with the gravity&#39;s help   ( ik this is all fake and wouldn&#39;t have happened coz i am in 2021 and that feature is still not integrated  )
This guy must have been hired by some company for actual visual effects.
Quedé 🤡
I came here because of tiktok
bro but if it fall facedown it just speed it up lmao 😜
Co2 tank neden üfleyerek doldurulmuyor
Funny how it looks and probably works like any other iphone
:)
So this was the technology that made my phone land on it&#39;s back all the time- good to know :3
Vengo de tik tok XD
Vg
Actually, the cocept is <b>FANTASTIC</b>
We don&#39;t need that we have airplane <br><br>Just remember to  turn it on
I hate apple<br>That feature didn’t work with my iPhone 7<br>Now my phone is broken and when I took it to Apple, they said that the feature doesn’t exist. Apple is a liar and a fraud. &gt;:(
When you accidentally put on a case and drop it
Anyone in 2021
First of all iPhone 12 pro max don&#39;t have parachute then iPhone 7
Came in your recommend ??
Wait why would apple do that because then they will get less people coming in for repairs. <br>Think smarter not harder
those co2 refills are gonna cost a fortune at minimum
😂
Wow. Now apple has made it space friendly. Attached RCs
Him: iPhone Parachute Concept<br>Me: Realizes I had Airplane And Dropped it <br><br>And Then<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>It flee

Wtf is wrong with apple bruh!!
Apple should be paying this guy tbh
Guess there time machine about the future broke ..... pathetic ...why bother making this 😲
They had us in the first half, I&#39;m not gonna lie
Me watching this in 2021 to see how cringe this is
Who else got this recommended 5 years later?
We hope that we can see it in iPhone 999999999999999999999999 model 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Such system could actually be useful
Damn why did i click this after 5 years
To be totally fair, a modern smart phone could totally control independent thrust vectoring nozzles. Just maybe not in a modern smartphone sized shell though.
Y si cae alrevez? Xd
Me
Meanwhile the 12 not having a parachute system lol
We have Space ship mode too
I was lowkey so confused for a good minute
That moment when your phone falls screen facing down 😂
2021?
Youtube after 5 years: ay check this out

The f****😂😂
Anyone else accidentally click the wrong video while reading the comments
Lol
Samsung will be  bankrupt if this was real
I hate apple for not making this
What the actual heck?!
Hmm.... No
Watching this in 2021.... and using iphone 12 be like🥱🥱
Iphone 12 rocket system

Bold of you to have assumed apple would be innovative
Me
This has aged quite well
Ğ ab
People back in the day thinking this will be true but now a days apple removed the charger from the phone case😂😂😂
aq son sistem telefonlarda bile yok şimdi bu arada instagrama selamlar
Eso explica porque quitaron el Jack de audifonos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlpr5ZH6OFI">https://youtu.be/qlpr5ZH6OFI</a><br>Is it good as a first animation 😅?
This shit got recommended to me in 2020<br>Can’t understand YouTubes algorithm
Bro I always watched this as a kid
POV: You are here but u have this in your recommendations
Me watching this on an IPhone 7
Missing those old days do u ??
U guys have phone ???!!!!😮
Nope they want your phone broken 4 better profit in repairs
ono
apple even wants you to pay $500 for back glass replacement and yall think of this back then?
&quot;Add CO2 gas&quot;,,, fine👍,,,, Now how much should we pay for iCO2??
Five years later and all they did was remove the home button and add some camera&#39;s
Whatttaffff?
Greatest meme of all time
😂😂😂
While holding iPhone 7 watching this video. Himmmmmm
From 2020
Refill cost 1000$
People complaining that the iPhone 7 doesn’t actually have this but if it did the phone would be like $3000
Is this for real
Ah yes rub the fact that I have had my phone for 5 years and counting in my face even more
<b>B R A V E</b>
So we are all here right now?
2015 : iPhone 7 Paracute System<br><br>Me in 2020 : Like that ever gonna happen.
Me watching this on an iPhone XR in 2020
Apple, take notes.
I remember this
Bullshit🤬
Wow I can’t wait 😂
What if your charging port gets too hot? Will the phone explode😳<br><br><br><br>Nvm CO2 is not flammable according to google
Can we say he works with apple
It’s all fun and games until u have to refill and pay $500 each time your phone falls
I can tell you that this is an lie.
Now days no innovations from apple
I phone 15 venom system
What if it falls on the screen?
Even If apple Got this technology if the back is Glass it&#39;s gonna shatter and also ruin the cameras.If it&#39;s metal and have metal coated camera covers it will be possible.
As a kid when I watched this, I always thought that apple was definitely going to do this someday but now that I think about it, why would they want to develop something that would protect your phone? If they increase the longevity of their phones, they won&#39;t be able to sell new ones. And this thought makes me feel betrayed
I am watching this on my iPhone 7.
Bruh
Apple: meet our newest innovation, the new ‘iPhone 7 Plus 2 Self Land Phone’
My 7 Plus laughed
Even in 2020 this still looked ridiculous
if they added this they would lose alot of money ( people wont come to replace there broken phone )
After 5 years even in iphone 12 they didn&#39;t add this feature
What if doesnot land on its back
Ohh fck why i had not taken this iPhone
Apple in 2020: &quot;In order to reduce CO2 emissions, we have decided to take a very bold step this year. We have decided not to provide the CO2 in the can. This will ensure that CO2 emissions are reduced by 1276% compared to previous year. We would say we are brave to take such a decision&quot;
Anyone after iPhone 12 launch?
The real deal is when the phone lands upside down and no parachute can save your freaking iPhone
Imagine dropping this while lying down with your face up,my eyes.
so is everyone in 2020 now here? or y’all seeing this in 2021
I hope for boomerang system so when it fall  it will come back to my hand
System like that would be implemented in iPhones last, after everyone else would&#39;ve done so already
Ok I don&#39;t know whether if its weird or not but I got this video in my recommendation after 5 years of it&#39;s releasing date😂😂
what
Me but why??😂😂
Guys every phone has this today. Set your phone in airplane mode, then drop it from any height. Way more simple than parachute mode.
If they really implemented that on iPhone they would use wireless CO2 refill system 😅😅😅😂😂
I wanna know what people thought when this came out
Remeber writing this in my school article 5 years ago
12 launched
What if it fell face first? It would fall faster
Bro its fake
Not me
Youtube lowkey selling Android devices like...
&quot;It&#39;s okay. We have airplane mode.&quot;
Que mierda
I legit believe this 5 years ago
Do you think about this is that it’s actually possible bars Apple so we won’t be seeing until 2080if were lucky
Let alone addition they even subtract wall charger😕
I phone become obsolete.......
lul
This actually would be a dope iphone to have tbh
Why is this in my recommendations after 5 years???
When are people going to get over the fact that an old video got recommended to them and a some other people? Like why does that fact continue to fascinate and amaze people and they KEEP JOKING ABOUT IT in EVERY COMMENT SECTION, EVERY TIME.
Wtf man i just drop my phone to check it now i am commenting from another mob
You want a dislike? Heres how you gonna get dislike
Am i the only one looking for comments of 5years ago? 😂😂
IPhone with RCS xd
Like this phone is not even in 2020😂
I’m currently watching this with my iphone 7 though 😂
Who else got this recommended after 12 years?
The iPhone 12 also came out, but we haven&#39;t seen anything like it yet.
Nice I want one
Imagine this being introduced and then iphones battery will drop even faster
I had a 7 plus and I didn’t know this existed.. but doesn’t work on my current iPhone 11 Pro Max, and now I have the back glass broken
Yes Apple is trying to make space for the parachute by removing THINGS every year. Bring me a nokia 3310
If Apple could do this (I know its fake), then there is obviously space for a headphone jack.
Why r people disliking this, guess they can&#39;t tale the joke.<br>Such an amazing video.
I tried this on my iPhone 7 and it work! The gravity work! And now my phone screen is cracked WHAT AN AMAZING DAY!
Who else watching on their ip7 🙋🏻‍♂️
Maybe:<br>Other companies do it in next 5-6 year.<br>Aplle in 3021: We have stolen something never seen before.
At least this one has a headphone jack
<b>what if the phone falls on the other side, it would fall faster right</b><br><br>*THINK*🙄
Me adds Helium.<br>😁
People in 2021 watching this video with iphone 7 be like
Ok. That&#39;s some dope ass editing and animation. Wow
Who else go this in their recommendations?
Oh no. Mine fell face-first and broke it&#39;s screen.
Title: Parachute system<br>Me: * laughing in airplane mode *
You wish
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕😂😂😂😂😂
Niceeuuuu 😂😂
Its 2020.. They took away the phone changer and you are talking about parachute
Got recommended after 5 yrs ,but still no parachute in phone😂
GAY
*CO2 level low *<br>User goes to buy a CO2 refill <br>Employee :- sir that will cost 900$ <br>User :- I intake more CO2 with one breath 😭 for free
I phone can&#39;t give 1 fkn charger and earphone but all fkn feature experiments and fkn shit and fkn etc etc
2015: Apple Parachute System<br><br>2020: No 3.5mm audio jack, no charger, no earpods<br><br>2021: no cables<br><br>2022: no phone. Buy it separately. <br><br>2023: no box either. You pay money for the CO2 for the proposed parachute system. Which is already all around you. Now jump from a tall building and see how well the valves and vents in your body work.
Va la bas
This was 5 years ago... and till now I didn’t know it.
Apple in 1993<br>Cheap but can do a lot of work<br>That’s Simple<br>Apple in 2020:<br>It’s Only 999$ and we won’t give you a charger or an earbuds.
Killed it
what even is the youtube algorithm
My life was a lie 😭
Lol
no no no this is actually genius
Why is this on my recommendations?
When u realise this was android
6 year old me thought it was real
Okay, weird.
So that was a lie
And parachute costs upto 10000$😆😆😆
Apple says that, this is the phone we ever made.
WTF. Apple 🍎 who took away the headphone jack, will add a CO² container inside it
Who else got recommended after 5 years.
If apple did this they are going to charge more than your car
Mr
I&#39;m from the future and the iPhones have the same design, they are just more expensive and doesn&#39;t have charger
YouTube algorithm is sus
This will be available after 5to 7 more years
It&#39;s way to square to be an iphone
CO2 tank<br><br><br><br><br><br>Where can i plug my airpod?
Lol
Lol.. Yr recommendee me this after 5 years..
youtube algorithm:
There&#39;s actually a phone case that does this now.<br>Not like, exactly same as in the video but some sort of plastic pops out when the phone falls
Totaly fake chat yes if u do to
Thank u. I need this.
I can confirm this is true.
Youtube reccomend you to watch this
Xd
Good Animation 🤣
Who is loocking this video with an iPhone 7 5 years Later and is like :  :/
This is better than the actual apple commercial 🤣
Me and my shitty iphone 7 even messenger dosen’t work good🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruh I have a iPhone 7 and ain’t do dis
I remember seeing this and thinking it was the real deal, smh
Lmao why are there so many dislikes. Do people take this seriously or something?
Who else got this in there recommendations 5 years later?
I bet 4,000 bucks that someone in this world thought that this was a leak of the return if the headphone jack
I remember thinking this was real
How didnt i not see this in 5 years and see it now wtf
If It Lands Face First You’re Gonna Be Fucked
И стоить будет как iPhone 2077
Yalanınızı sikim 2020 yirmiden selam 😂
The cost of that CO2 tank equals 1 iPhone unit.<br><br><b>Good luck</b>
Ютуб в 2015: не волнуйся ты попадёшь в рекомендации через 5 минут.<br>Ютуб в 2020: а ой ошибся, через 5 лет.
This concept is pretty shitty. Even if there is a CO2 tank in the phone, why doesn&#39;t it inflate an airbag lol.
😂😂😂😂.    👁👅👁👍
Little did they know, all apple would do is remove the headphone jack
Why is this recommended to me anyway:D
The fact that it’s an iPhone 6 is just great
Directed by Robert B. Weide
Just so you know <br>Apple removed a headphone jack, touch id and charger from the box let alone a whole co2 tank
🖤
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
It is not in i phone 12
Jokes?
I remember the first time I saw this video🤣🤣
Ithenth miruuu
Holy shit apple forget to put co2 cylinder in my iphone7
dec.27.2020 lols
After 5 years YouTube recommend me this😂😂
We&#39;re about to be in 2021 and apple still didn&#39;t put parachute system<br><br>Instead of it they took the fingerprint system, headphone jack, charger
watching it right now makes me laugh so hard
After watching this after 5 years who all thought never believe this kind of videos
They are not going to do this if phone&#39;s doesn&#39;t break how will they make money
This actually can be a real thing but reason why it is not well co2 tank would be really really small and with pressure high like that it would only last like 0.01 seconds which wont save your phone fron smashing<br>To be able to save it from smashing on floor, considering average weight of smartphone (100 - 200 grams) and high pressure, tank should be bigger than your head, if my calculations are right which probably are not
😂😂
<b>Space X has entered the chat</b>
This came Outta nowhere!
Lol it doesnt have a head phone jack let alone a automatic co2 powered thrusters lol waste of money
Should try this now
This so cool😎
back here again after 5 years
Shit!
Who is seeing this video after iphone 12 launch?
Imagine if you dropped your phone and you pick it up and drop it again
Dislikes are from the backcover users
When your phone has parachute but can’t even use earphones
Recomended on december 27 2020 who else<br>👇
Haha what thw fuck is this dude haha🤣🤣
What the fuck
Damn i remember this
Watching this after 5 years😂😂
I hate it... So much CO2
That would&#39;ve been a cool feature too bad they don&#39;t put it on their phones because it makes them less money since you won&#39;t break your phone so fast.<br><br>You put the tank in front of the charging port
🤣🤣🤣😍
Xd
Merry Christmas if your watching this after 5 years
I’m watching once again after 5 years 😂😂
Kinda late but would have preferred a headphone jack back in the days instead of this
How many of you get it recommend
Apple could probably do this now
Am i the only who got recommend this after 5yrs
Not possible
@RE4PER Like anyone cares
🤣🤣🤣
Is this a Meme, recommended after 5 years 🤭
ok
2021?
Fake
Has it really been 5 years
why does this video get recommended after the new iPhone 12 came out
Meanwhile 2020:<br>Apple: WOWW!! We have magnets on the back
Ohh shii- I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS AS A KID
Apple: CO2 gas price is only $1199
I don&#39;t thinks so that this is real 😅😅
Red sus
Skydiphone
The phone perfectly meant for tony stark. 😔
Yeah yeah i see the iphone 12 too
Me
But what if you jumped?<br>The iPhone will sense that it is falling <br>Then it would activate in your pocket<br>Then it would send you to mars
Add CO2 gas, only $800 from Apple. Also, those nozzles won’t do shit because I’ll be slapping on a case on that already pricy bitch.
2 mins silence for the people who thought this was real ...
Bruh I still remember when this rumour was going around😂
Treelon 🌲 Musk is typing..
Who is watching after after I phone 12 pro max has launched 😂
Knowing me my dumb butt would try to put my phone charger through the holes
Who else got recommend after 5 years
iPhone using subscribers of this channel left the chat
me realizing apple would never do that because they’re Addicted to money
No one:<br>Youtube’s algorithm in 2020:
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT LEVEL CGI, OMG....
Epic 🤣😂🤣😂
Plot Twist: The iPhone is really in millions of little pieces
Iphone 7<br><b>While the iPhone is a iphone 6</b>
accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and saviour sex before marriage and porn is a sin you will go to hell if you dont repent and turn away from your wicked ways GOD bless stay safe either way I hope you have a amazing Day.
If it falls face down you&#39;re fucked
Wow saw this video when i was 16.  I&#39;m 21 now.

😂😂😂
It&#39;s an alien  starship
Inspiration from nokia3310.
Not included in the front, they still need the 400 dollar screen repairs. How else could they make any money?

Yes indeed my iPhone 7 has this kind of system
Wtf! Is it real.

Now 12 ok bye
Apple will do it ,<br>If they do, who will visit their service centers .
What if tho
I remember watching this in elementary school 💀
It is mobile not aeroplane 😂😂😂
Me I was like what about the iPhone 12
Не выгодно. Чем больше телефонов не сломается, тем больше не продаст новых компания..
Like could you imagine? This is 2077 cyber punk crap dood
I phone&#39;s iron man version
🤣🤣🤣👍🏼
I am searching for a comment from 5 years ago.
Can I use this system to make the phone fly to me from my table ?..
My phone won’t even update past iOS 11
From where that headphone jack comes??
NASA wants to know the location
hmmm.... I see. <b>types in  iphone 12</b>
Me
I remember watching this 5 years ago
it&#39;s still not in my budget
This could have saved soooo many people lots of money but Apple won&#39;t even try to bring it so that people could go to them and fix the phones
Damn
turn upside down
I watched this video the day it released, Now i got this recommend again after 5 years, This made me remember old memories. Those days i phone is a dream to me, now i have i phone 12 pro max                                                                                            <br><br><br>Keep fighting for your dreams one day you will achieve it
Hum to chutiya he
Apple’s new leaks are expecting to have a phone with no port and people thought 5 years ago that this was realistic lmao
<i>Apple: $700 to recharge CO2 tank</i>
Its already iPhone 12 and still no gas
Kids and old people&#39;s please don&#39;t do this at home!!
It&#39;s better to have propeller that fly like drone..
Yo I got mine in reverse when I drop it it launches into the ground and breaks:(
Well you should have told me  it&#39;s fake earlier . I threw my friend&#39;s iPhone from the terrace.
This is genius.
Hello people from the recommendations
yeah, good luck finding a charging port on the iphone 13-
ifone break
Is there a wireless CO2 recharger
The gas refill will be £1299 thank you :)
Is this a joke? And why are we here anyway? Lmao.
Plot twist: it’s 2020 and iPhones are shittier than all previous models
Yes, but i let you introduce us the sound of this shit xD
Raga ma che cazzo
oh, nice
Una cover???
Watching this on my iPhone 12 Pro Max...
Thats the most fake thing I ever saw in my life
Just make sure airplane mode is on, otherwise it won&#39;t work
I watched this on my iPhone 7

Why is this recommended....wtf
Apple in 2021: &quot;We removed the Charging port so you don&#39;t need to charge your phone all the time&quot;<br><br>Apple in 2022: &quot;We ReMoVeD ThE PoWEr ButToN BeCauSE We&#39;RE LaZY!!<br><br>Apple in 2023: &quot;Fuck off&quot;
Didn&#39;t realize that the iphone 7 came out 5 years ago wow
Even if they could the most probably wouldn’t as fragile phones make them more money
nah... we need headphone jack
Christmas for anyone?
Iphone 7 was just 5 years?
Qué recuerdos xd
YouTube Recommended after 5 years?? Seriously??
After seeing this in 2020 <br>Me: 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
This seems like something you&#39;d see on 4chan
If this was possible, who else would try this instead of bunjee jumping?
Apple be like in 2021: i like this idea that is great lets remove the charging port
Dang I got a iPhone 7 but it doesn’t have a parachute 😔
HOLD UP WAS THERE EVEN A IPHONE 7 5 YEARS EARLIER
Considering the growth of apple, by 2050 it will create iPhone 30 with 15 cameras!
They were defiantly overthinking this one, just add a gyro scope and a reputable pillow and ur doneeee.

After 5 years .. youtube is high on weed.
What happens if it falls on the screen and not on the back ?
All fun and games until ios 25 forgets to update the Co2 bug fixes and you drop your phone and it explodes from the Co2
Hymmm, it&#39;s maybe even possible to make something like that
Saw it 5 years ago
Honestly tho, how cool would this be?
Follow my Instagram if you are watching on an iPhone 7(@yohannes208)
Everyone one doesn’t know that Apple doesn’t want headphone jack or the charger bc it makes the factory too hard and also the camera could get better, Apple thinks what he’s gonna do, U all Samsung users need to think then speak!
If only apple actualy did somthing innovate.
And finally CO2 tank price is more than iphone 12
Lol
what
This tec is Insan
Apparently they don&#39;t even have the space to put a headphone jack...
Why do you think
Co2 tank, LMAO WHAT A JOKE, THEY CAN&#39;T EVEN PUT IN A HEADPHONE JACK AND A CHARGING BRICK LET ALONE A CO2 TANK
It not apple it space X
Future phone hover board 🤤
The hell I wish this was true
Me after watching this:<br> dropping  my iPhone 7<br>Iphone:🤕
2015 : iPhone with parachute <br>2017 : iPhone without headphones <br>2018 : iPhone without 3.5mm jack<br>2019 : iPhone without charger<br>2020 : iPhone without battery <br>2025 : iPhone with every single screw in a separate box<br><br><br><br><br><br>There is something with 2016<br>If anybody recalls it pls tell me

Me lok
Hi people 5 years later
Fake
😥😥I dropped my father&#39;s iPhone 7 from 2nd floor my home now I am living on ground floor pls help 😣<br>Thanks for 0 likes 😉😉
Recommended after 5 years
The iPhone runs out of charge in a day, if it had that system it would run out in 15 minutes 😂
So hyped for this phone because I have a old iphone 12 pro max
Who else got this recommended after 5 years ?
Lol
THIs sO faKe a FeAl FoNe WoOd dIe Xd Lmao
That&#39;s just a repulsor system, not some parachute. And, why did this get recommended to me after 5 years, anyway?
Is it real
Still I have the iPhone 7 plus and I have never seen this thing once it fell from the terrace and It cracked. It costed me 100 dollars to repair it. Nothing like this happened now I am using the iPhone 12 mini but still I use 7 plus as my secondary phone
bro that co2 tank wouldnt last half a drop if would finish instantly
And I’m watching it with my 7 plus. Fuck you
Who else watched this when u didn&#39;t had unlimited internet.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bluetoothdays">#Bluetoothdays</a>
Jajajajajajaja que mierda  <br><br><br>Real
Apple is too lame to do such thing it&#39;s sad
Merry Christmas Everyone🤶
Thinking apple will add more things to the phone, ITS A PRANKK!!
I have the iPhone 7 and it sucks
YouTube be like:<br><b>Ok so let&#39;s recommend this after 5 years.</b>
Wow great imagination
What am I supposed to do with this in 2020?
5 years ago : iPhone 7 with parachute charger...<br>How it end : iPhone 12 without charger.
Want to see the comments of people 5 years ago... But can&#39;t find any😂😂
Elon Musk can make this possible.
This video is so fake<br><br><br><br><br>The iPhone 7 doesn’t have a headphones Jack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3J7R6WBJJc&amp;t=25">0:25</a>
We unite once again
You do know Apple wants you to break your phone so they earn more money. Were we that stupid?
Apple, Challenge Everything 💸
What if it drops on display side? 😂
LOL
What if he uses this parachute mode after turning on the airplane mode
It has parachute mode and airplane mode also.
Who thought a parachute will deploy.
I didn&#39;t search for this
A headphone jack? Impossible!
Fake
It got me in the first half ngl ...
Wait Apple wanted to do this! Who&#39;s going to replace with a new iPhone-20,20XL,XXL,XXXL  the following year? Of course with the significant upgrade, 20x price tag change. 😂
Biggest scam ever 😂
Whhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaatttttt!!!
Who else got this in their recommended after 5 years
What if the phone falls vertically?
This system: <br>thought of: in 2015<br>Built: never <br>Not till 2020 at least
Nokia: Connecting people <br>YouTube: We like that that&#39;s our algorithm<br>😎
Anybody else got this on their recommendations??
Man phones are evolving to a level that is scientifically not possible
Why does this feel like it was part of an elaborate plan by 4chan to troll iphone users?
Wtf if phone drops from front??
It might work! And here&#39;s how:<br><br>According to our recent experience, apple is slowly removing charger and that all, so after some time there will be no battery, hence more extra space for those CO2 gAs CYlInDeR!
Those days.... When they put literally everything thing in a single device...... <br><br><br><br><br><br>And now they they even removed charger😟
2020: tell me why this is more amazing than me???
🙄
Getting such accuracy and precision is not possible
If apple did this, instead of pushing the phone upwards, it would push the phone downwards so it&#39;ll break more and you&#39;ll have to pay even more to fix it
That’s how a spaceX phone would be..
Spoiler:-<br>I just tried it, and it didn’t work.<br>Booooooooo
Isn’t that a iPhone 6😂
Well,this didn&#39;t age well
Lol
thats 2077 technology mate
We had so much expectations from Apple back then
Fun fact: You got this recommended
This is insane
Here for the roasting comments 🍿🥤
Imagin if the phone fell on the screen side and the paraahut system kicked in
I got at recommended after 5 years
Why are people acting so shocked that this is in their recommended?<br><br>It isn&#39;t that crazy...<br>People have been and will continue to get recommended this video.<br><br>You&#39;re roughly just as likely to have gotten recommended this video 3 years ago, though you probably didn&#39;t because of your viewed history.<br><br>I guarantee you that if you were not signed into an account and had your history turned off, you would most likely not get recommended videos that makes sense based on your history.<br><br>This thing is anything but unordinary or weird to appear in someone&#39;s recommended.<br><br>Why are people so fixated on the YouTube recommended algorithm. It seriously isn&#39;t that hard to comprehend.<br><br>If you&#39;ve watched weird/ random videos, you get recommended more random videos.<br>If you&#39;ve watched short videos, you get recommended more short videos.<br>If you&#39;ve watched tech videos, you get recommended more tech videos.<br>If you&#39;ve watched animal videos, you get recommended more animal videos.<br>Cat videos, science videos, gaming, informative, cooking, news, etc.<br><br>The more videos you watch - the less likely getting recommended something random is.
What if it falls on the screen side?
Fake
And then it falls on its screen
Merry Christmas!!
Is this meant to be a joke because it funny
Bruhh... My phone has airplane mode 😏

This is obviously fake. The iPhone 7 does not have a headphone jack.
So, here is the headphone jack 🎃
Me: <b>Drops iPhone to see if it works</b><br><br>Phone: ima end this mans whole career
Now u know better
In 2020 people would just inhale the C02 instead of refilling it for there parachute
Reality: no headphone jack and sad hissing sounds 😂
But in 2020 no charger in the box
2020 iPhone 12 have the design of iPhone 5
iPhone 7: &quot;Parachute system&quot;<br>Also iPhone 7: Has no parachute
A little late, I have an 11 pro
I did
Op
What if it drops on the screen side?
Commenting from 2058. They finally added this to the iphone! I cant wait to test it out next time Apple allows me to go outside!
Nah instead Apple made the backs of their phones out of glass and $600 to replace
Youtube be tripping sometimes bruh .
When this was released, I thought it was real.
😂
I have this with dubbel parachute 🪂
iPhone 7 out hear with a parachute system and my iPhone 12 doesn&#39;t come with a charger. Smh
Fun fact: You didn&#39;t search for this.<br>       Like if you agree 👇👇😎
Recommendations are crazy bringing back old stuff
this is the most bullshit thing i have ever seen
Why does this makes giggle ?😂
That&#39;s the iphone 6s plus tf the 7&#39;s  obviously has no headphone Jack the first phone apple removed it from this is a smart a** comment because I dont know sh* abt the new phones lost track on dat
If you lost your tube, just blow it. Because we exhale co2 xD
Is that real?
I think it&#39;s a good investment
I thought this was a rumour
now : no charger .... and u can&#39;t repair the phone too :P oh and $1K plz
Even with no headphone jack, the battery size is only about 1700 mAh. I think this model doesn&#39;t included with the battery, isn&#39;t it?
Where can I get one
Google
Merry 2020 xmas
Me when I fart
This made me cringe lol
why tf is this recommended to me now
I like how the iPhone was running android
Who else getting the iphone 11 an skipping 12
That is very interesting.
thats really funny
Lol fake
XD
Cyberpunk 2077
In collaboration with spaceX
iPhone 7 in 2015: it will have a parachute system<br>iPhone 7 : this phone fucking dies when fall
2015: We expect features to be added to the phone.<br><br>2020: Apple took away the charger 2 years after they took away the headphone jack.<br><br>2030 - Apple: Announcing the new Iphone 22 with no screen (You have from your old one)...
what a fucking liar dude, what a fucking weasly little liar dude<br><br><br><br><br>he’s literally lying to his audience
My dude worked so hard on one idea he had after his phone fell from 5 cm high and cracked
Apple is too cheap and greedy with their phones to make this
So you&#39;re plane&#39;s crashing? Don&#39;t worry, your phone has a parachute!<br><b>But you don&#39;t</b>
The fact that it’s not even an iPhone 7
Add a small compressor so it can fly like the Mars rover skycrane thingy
Hi
Tesla: Wait! That is illegal
Was that an iPhone 7 with a headphone jack?
14 yrs me thinking it was real
El tanque de Co2 está en el centro de carga jajajajajaja
The most unlegit shot I&#39;ve seen
Oh he cuz a little😂 air is gonna stop a phone
better a phone cover
Who would’ve thought that it would’ve had no headphone jack
iphone 12: LOL :/
Wow is rally bello cosa
Will the CO2 tank replacement be included with Apple Care +?
Why am I getting this??
if i had this phone i would just keep dropping it and refilling the co2 lol
Maybe in Cyberpunk<br>😂
I m watching this with my iphone 7 and mine is definitely don t fall like a spaceship lol
Animators from 5 years ago have better ideas than apple now. How the tables have turned.
Bruh, only new thing is no headphone jack😂
This just shows what wrong way of development technology follows today.
I have the 7 and sure isnt this cool😅
Damn already 5 yrs
What about the front?
Bro apple couldn&#39;t even add a headphone jack, let alone a whole CO2 tank
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was 15 when this came out and i legit thought this was the leaked commercial for the new phone and shared this shit with my entire school and everyone believed it. And guess what how the iphone 7 came with no headphone jack. ._.
This ended well...
Mee
😂😂😂😂😂
&#39;New&#39;
Halah peler
Is this real?
You have better specs instead apple 🤣🤣😍😍
We dont have a charger and you talkin about parachute
Cyberpunk 2077
iPhone 12 came out still no feature such as this
They dony have space to fit headphone jack how tf are they going to fit this shit
Who else getting this in their  recommeded in XMAS??? Happy XMAS BTW🔥❤️
what
Im just watching on my iph 7 and my phone is like “thats bull crap ma man.”
They don&#39;t even have  single hole for headphone jack, forget about this 😂🤣
Our iPhones had it it&#39;s just we didn&#39;t throw it that way.
Video:iphone 7 parachute system<br>Iphone 12: nothing <br>Hotel: trivago
Lmao 5 years ago ppl thinking the headphone jack was gonna stay 😌
Фигня
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3J7R6WBJJc&amp;t=24">0:24</a> they got so pissed off of this fake marketing they even removed the jack in 7.
Imagine jumping with this phone and then its starting to spit CO2
Stop The Cap
Whoever&#39;s idea is this, it&#39;s bullshit
what if the phone dropped with the screen facing down??........ boost fall intensifies....
Actually brilliant
This is possible you can add a thruster but it would look the size of a spaceship but still has the same screen and the world is wonderful
Recommended iphone 7 in 2021 @.@
Is this really a thing?
Android: let me find my diaper
That wouldn&#39;t work anyways, because first of all the jet propulsions would make the phone do random flips and hit the ground harder and because our knoledge of jet propulsion and collinear calculation isn&#39;t that advanced yet.
my fucking iPhone12 cant even do that. wtf is wrong with technology nowadays...
As an iPhone 7 user I can confirm that this indeed is fake.
All fun and games till ur trying to put ur phone on ur table and it won’t stop hovering
And the Youtube algorithm brought all us back together once again...
who else threw their iPhone 7 from the balcony to see if it worked?
Phone: Falls screen facing down<br>Also phone: &quot;I&#39;m in danger&quot;
HAHA YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES OF COURSE
lol
What if it fell the other side tho
Hope iphone 13 will get it
It&#39;s not a parachute, it&#39;s a JETPACK!
mal
Definetly a 4chan prank lol
It&#39;s cool until it falls screen first ⚠️
wowww
Was I the only one who fell for this 5 years ago?
Who else thinks this is fake
Is this for real
They even added headphone jack 🤣🤣
The amount of cap we all beleived
It&#39;s fake, iphone 7 don&#39;t have 3,5 mm jack
Lel
Also new iPhones: WE rEmoVe hEadPhoNe jAckS anD stIlL doNt gIvE yOu AiR pOdS aS ThE DefAuLt hEad pHOneS
Me search in Amazon 😂 😂
They got lucky they have the limited edition Iphone 7 with a headphone jack wish mine had that.
Wow that&#39;s so amazing
Here I am with my iPhone 8+ and it can’t protect itself
iPhone XXX will let out rocket engine that can help your smartphone go to atmosphere and then detonate it self
This is more like spaceX crew dragon
Wow parachute system without parachute . And the CO2 cylinder sold separately.
Me: jumping from a airplane <br>My friend : bro you didn&#39;t take parachute <br>Me: I have iPhone 7 bro, so don&#39;t worry 😅
2017 will be the new 2007 pretty soon
when Elon Musk bought a phone
This is never possible with such a thin phone. 😒😒😒
5 years ago, In the year 2015, an I Phone appears &amp; everything changed<br><br>                                      - Erehhh
Is this real ?
The hand looks real af
2020: N A H

What will happen if it falls frontside down?
Who else believed it before ?
Hello guys don&#39;t believe in it. It&#39;s fully animated
I actually thought this was really gonna happen, that’s how great apple used to be
Why did everybody got recommended after 5 yearsss
So its a phone with thrusters.
Iphone 7 : has parachute<br>Iphone 12: doesn&#39;t include the charger in the box<br>Iphone 13 : threre is no phone on the box
2 min silence for those thinking this is an inbuilt feature in Iphone 7
bruh imagine driving at 50mph and your phone randomly starts farting
Wait until this gets recommended 5 years later
apple&#39;s way of saying &quot;our phones are weaker than eggs so we are gonna charge you for stuff we told we would put but we didn&#39;t &quot;
Imahine when the phone falls upside down
WHY YOUTUBE RECOMMEND THIS IN 2021 ?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hydraulic air system
This is what happen if Apple create a phone with SpaceX
maybe the reason why this is recommended to me after 5 years is because I can now afford it lol
Innovation...
Who else got Recomended after 5 years lol
iPhone 7 with headphone jack????? 😂😂😂😂😂
Apple wouldnt do this it would make them less money bc repairs and cases
That&#39;s not even a parachute
Shut up, I have aeroplane mode
2030: Phone sold separately
Haha funny headphone jack
Look at the size of the iPhone 7 Display 😂😂
But indian version doesn&#39;t have that<br>Sad iphone 7 users<br>Including me
Well I have iphone 7s and I didn’t see any feature like this!!🤪🤪🤪

They gave parachute in 2015 and now they removed charger in  iphone  12 next year  they will remove the whole mobile in iphone 13 and say buy 1000 dollars samsung

Ok but this is actually a good idea. Although you might as well just get a case lol
Keep on dreaming friend<br>iPhone is still as the same
Fake vedio
Can’t believe I found this after 5 years 😂
When I saw the co2 I just said nah
iPhone concepts are better than the actual phones lol
Rip to all those people who thought it was real
Ah yes, better to over engineer a whole rocket propulsion system in a phone than just make the glass stronger
The announcement: iPhone 7 flies after touching the ground <br>My iPhone 7: falls and breaks all the way off, Touch ID also gone*<br>Me: constantly crying*
Bruh just get a good case and your giod
Nobody ; Apple products are fragile<br>Apple : instead of making it durable, we can make parachute.
im using an iphone 7 and still tried this feature
This some SpaceX elon musk type stuff
bruh we on the iphone 12 and this shits screen still breaks when it’s dropped from 3 feet
fake obviously apple will make us pay a million dollars for this feature
hahaha
I remenber when i got this in recommend 5 years Ago and believe this lol
5 years ago I would&#39;ve thought this was the coolest thing in the world. <br><br><br><br><br><br>I still do ❤
This looks gud🎉<br><br><b>Looks at my money</b><br><br>;-;
Got recommended today
Fake
What we really wanted for 2020 not COVID
Ahora te lo andan dando en una pinshi bolsa.
in a real argument, how much thrust would it require to at least slow down the mass of the phone for impact prevention
Iphone 12: doesn&#39;t even include power cube
i stg these concepts are always objectively unrealistic
Nokias should have a parachute system to protect the floor
we wish
we wish
we wish
Funny how advanced we thought the future was gonna be
So this is the sign that i need to buy a new phone?
i bet theres a girl who would murder for those nails
5 year&#39;s ago
I know this fake but this is sick
I am the only one who wants to meet the person in charge of the recommendations? he must be a great person
Apple when see <br>APPLE:NOOO BRAKE IPHONES BECAUSE AMERICANS NEED BUT NEW<br>AMERICANS:WOW O2 SYSTEM IN IPHONE GOOD IDEA <br>NOTHING:WHEN O2 TANKS ADDED TO IPHONE 12 <br>APPLE:R.I.P<br>APPLE:SELL ONE RECHARGE FOR 99999$<br>APPLE:LIVE <br>APPLE TOO:  STONKS√√√
Why was the phone going towards the ground at 135 mph
Rocket thrusters on ya iphone
That would actually be cool and really convenient 😂
Nice concept. 😎
Starship Sn-9 looking pretty sick
Makes sense why google is recommending us this... they do hate apple
The funniest thing is that the iphone 12 has a bigger notch than the guy thought the iphone 7 would have..
Noice CB/ClickBaet
😅😅😅😅😅😂
Damn I wish I got that on my  iPhone 7
You know you wouldn&#39;t have to do this and end up skyrocketing the price of the phone up by 200% and just build a durable phone like everyone else
Thats what I expect of 800 bucks phone
Nobody:<br>Youtube Algorithm: Lets remember this wonderful video.
IPhone 7 with mini jack. 1 minute of silence
This can never happen because apple makes money from repairs
jeez... i got this recommendation on 24th Dec 2020 😑
2020 : the phone come without charger<br>2021 : we don&#39;t put the phone in the box
Lol if apple actually made this, they would be like &quot;iTs oNlY 9,999,9999$&quot;
nunca pasó XD
Pizza and noodles
Xdxdxdxdxz
And there&#39;s still not even a headphone jack
Apple: buy apple air now ($680)
Imagine apple actually adding a tank of co2 for 80 dollars per tank
Me
Waadaaaa heck?
Wonder when everything went downhill
At last, some people got saved from having a heart attack.
They thought about that sht but after 5 years still don’t have 120hrz like what da fock
I saw this when It first came out and now it’s recommended 5 years later crazy
What do u think that is a Nokia!? Bruh that’s an iPhone a small drop like that could give you a broken display
Cool
Kinda funny tho, since 5 years ago they thought they got a rendering of a parachute mode in iphone7 but now we aren&#39;t even getting a charger in the box for iphone 12
Sorry telat 5 tahun
Make the phone durable that even if it falls nothing would happen. No need of such technology
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Or put on a fucking case
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wtfffffff
cool idea but even 5 years later still pretty much impossible to fit that kind of tech into a phone
Oh chute I dropped my phone
Super necessary
nooo u idiots who created this video I ended up smashing my phone <br>talking about parachute
This is not even real I am watching this on IPHONE 7
Me
this would be so cool omg
why my iphone 8 not look better that this?
I honestly thought that this was an ad, not a YouTube video
So thia is where Elon musk got the idea for falcon 9 booster landing
Wtf we really thought about that 5 years ago
YouTube recommendation is kind of funny
Dmn you Apple you dont have INNOVATION you guys are just improving the old technologies from other companies and tell to the people that you fckng invented it and call it innovation! Your Iphone design sucks too dfk Overprice Iphone12 with no charger brick and a fckng outdated 60hz refresh rate
parachute? they don&#39;t even give a charger.
no.
Why is this recommended now?
Youtube after 5 years: time to recommend 2015 videos 📹 👌
absolute lies, the iPhone i the vid is not landing screen facing down
Old world - films get popular<br>Now - any YouTube algorithm/video get popular
Imagine. This phone in your pocket. One day you accidentally fall from the building. Then you fly and survived
My mom once dropped my iPhone 7 from the balcony, but I had Airplane mode turned on.
Who else got this in their recommendations in December 2020? (happy early Christmas to everyone celebrating!)
What is it falls upside down ? Then what ?
Its 2020 December , even iPhone12 cant do this. 🤣🤣🤣
Watch this in 2020 and lahuing so much
WOULD ACTUALLY THROW AWAY MY IPHONE 7 PURPOSELY NOW
Noob
😌
Iphone 12 Pro max Rebirth of iphone 5 Came and parachute system will come after iphone 20
that&#39;s an iphone 6. obvious headphone jack. nc try
Lol
Tukang servis hp langsung gulung tikar
Stupid feature ever when it got realism
What if it fell sideways??!?...
Iphone concept:  <b>most advanced phone in the world</b> <br><br>Iphone in reality:  <b>5 years old technology</b>
😂😂
Ha Ha.<br>Still have headphone jack
That&#39;s cool
Why this recommend after 5 years
Someone actually tried and do it on their iPhone 7 seriously
When we thought this was real!
Haa bas yahi reh gaya tha.. tum logo ko toh isro/nasa me hona chahiye
My phone have an airplane mode
Watched it 5 years ago <br>And watching it again
Nice joke, even after fkin 5 years...
Ok cool... But what if it lands on the other side 😎😎
Ngl this concept is so well built and put together that it could have worked well if commercially launched
This shit funny
Why do I have a video of a rocket phone in my recommended?
I have to admit, that is pretty dope
Fuck parachutes we don&#39;t even gets charger now.
Youtube gathered us here again after five year.....
😂
This is so fake lol<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>There’s a headphone jack
Bro...they don&#39;t even have space for a headphone jack...where the hell will they put the CO2 tank😂😂
Who Else Thought This Was Real?
lol what
Finally 5 year video I got to see but not technology😂Scam 2015
Actually saw this video 5 years back but forgot to comment lol. It’s never too late
When you have the iPhone 7 and throw it because you saw this
Welcome to &#39;what is in my recommendation today&#39;   well its just getting better &amp; better.😉🤣
Do we tell him?
Apple doesn’t care enough about the public to release this very much real and secret feature
this is absolutely fake, why would they overthrow airplane mode off for something like this??
Expectation: Parachute<br>Reality: HD screen resolution lmao
Wait is that really really real?
Who else wanted this to happen over 5 years ago
I tell you what if this was real I would spend my entire time with my phone just dropping it
Expectations:iPhone 7 parachute<br>Reality:iPhone 12 without charger
Loool parachute
so....we all are here today
Economically this doesn&#39;t make sense. Why would they protect your device, when they can sell you a new one?
Wow my iPhone 7 must have missed the update too mad my 11pro doesn&#39;t have this
Welcome to the space age, where everything including your phone has RCS thrusters.
I want it
Genial KKKKKKKKKKKK
After taking out the headphone jack and when they take out the charging port they actually have room for this but we’re not getting it
Y pensar que ahora en mero 2020 ya ni con cargador ni audífonos  los quieren vender
I remember when this video came out
“CYBER PUNK”
Someone time travel at the past <br>Lamao<br>Recommend after 5 years 🙄
NASA works with iphone now
The gas is nearly not enough to do something like that
retro thrusters
Wait, is this real?
Thanks YouTube.<br><br>This was a life-changing video.
That’s not an iPhone 7, it’s got a headphone jack
This is Snk iphone
It seems YouTube recommendations have brought us all together
the 21K dislikes are from the people who thought that was real and tested it
I was not the only one who got this in recommendation after 5 years
LMAO
Me
5 years ago? Who else got the same recommendation?
“Add CO2 gas”<br><br>Apple: Yeah, that’s going to run you about $500 for each one.
tf
Yall know that this is actually possible right??
i could do without an epileptic seizure
<b>who got this recommended since 5 years ago... like if you did</b>
Umm idk but I’m pretty sure an iPhone 7 don’t have a headphone jack
Or just make tougher phones ..
me in ksp:I swear i&#39;ill play normal this time<br>5 mins. later:
Hoax
So when will the i phone 7 come out?
This is an iPhone 6 lol
hahah
XD
Gotta love the archaic ideas back in the day about future tech up there with holographs, modular phones and 3D screens lmfao.
2020 still shit phone
Me in 2020: “dang this would be cool rn ngl”
Ngl i was expecting a full on parachute to come out of it but aight
If Elon Musk owns Apple
This is an iPhone 6 and not an iPhone 7
I can&#39;t believe we actually thought we would get this lol I remember I was so excited cuz my mom was gonna get one
This is a concept. It literally says that in the description. Stop moaning that it&#39;s not real.
funny buІІshіt
thats an iphone 6 ngl
But what happens if it falls upside-down 🤔😬
Looking back at this in 2020 made me laugh
İf steve jobs was alive that could be possible
Lmao
Imagine the alternate universe where apple made this...
2015:they told there would be parachute <br>2020: charger separate in other box<br>Thanks for the likes!!
Pretty sure that’s not a parachute but more like thrust reversers😂 Better than no charger tho
just watching this on a broken iphone7
Oh hey, I remember this concept! Lots of people thought that it would actually be added at the time, haha
this would be very sick!
when these fan made videos are much much better than apple itself---
I once threw a plane with phone mode on
What?
Yup, just like the actuals
A memont of silence to those who actualy believe this is true.
why did i get this on my recommeded after 5 years?
Bruh iphone trash
Apple seems focused on making phones that we would see in futuristic movies and go “oh wow they would be cool” except they’re trying to show us how impractical that stuff would be 😂
I hope we can all tell that’s not a iPhone 7 because it has a headphone jack. Plus the head phone jack is on the wrong side. Either way. Good concept of a new phone parachute
You must be embarrassed to watch this 5 years after you posted this
There are 5 more now......... Well done YouTube algorithm
Nah, it looks plausible on sketch bench, but realistically speaking, this will never happen with today&#39;s technology. <br><br>Do they know how much thrust force is needed to just lift a static phone off the table? Let alone to do what was illustrated in this video, break the accelerating phone&#39;s speed, and make it hover and land slowly.<br><br>It can be done, but not with that small form factor of co2 container and pipe system. It&#39;s like, &quot;using a battery AA size to power an electric car for 100 miles&quot;. It just can&#39;t be done with today&#39;s (and in near future) technology....
I’ve saw this in iPhone 7 without parachute system :(
2020: Iphone 12 - No charger system
2015 : saving a phone with air pressure.<br>2020: getting pressure due to carona .
Lol recommendation after 5 years and after watching this laughing in the corner of my room
This would be super cool
Waaaowww
I remember seeing it before the release...
Bruh just put it on Airplane mode
Smol but stronk nozzles
Shut the f off youtube after 5years.
anyone got this on recommended today?
prototype: EXIST<br><br>Me:IRON MAN PHONE
After 5years I&#39;m lmao
somehow we believe this 5 years ago
Cant believe it came out 5 years ago
What of it fall other side
🤣🤣🤣
Getting blasted in the face with air
Lmao y we all getting dis in our recommendations 5 years lateer
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
iPhone 12 <br><br><b>Charger sold separately</b>
Where is Ray Mak?
When the phone fall in wrong direction the jet will activate and that phone hit more hardly
Ig parachute is sold seperately
This deserves an XD
Five years ago they were putting parachute system in it and now we don&#39;t get an headphone jack 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lmao
Who else got this in thier recommended?
The Good Old Days When we thought this would be there 🥺
When people are more innovative than an entire decade of Apple.
iPhone 2077
Do iPhone 7 Plus have parachute system ?
We can fart on the headphone jack to fillup co2 tank
I just tried this with my iPhone 7 Plus <br>Fml it’s a lie
Legends got fooled by buying this brand new iphone7
Parachute mode my arse! My phone has been having Gravity sensor that removes Gravity of Earth before falling.... Actually, whenever a rocket is launched NASA, ESA, JSA OR RUSSIAN SPACE all of them ask me to turn off gravity so that they can launch their rockets... It&#39;s my phone that&#39;s keeping Moon in orbit..... Woooff
these concepts are getting too far💀
Back when leaks were fun
Who else is watching this 5yrs later?
Me: watching this on iphone 7
Some people just got this recommended
Good toys i can refill Co2 and fucking Drop it and doing like this Again XD
So fake the iphone 7 has bin out for 5 years haha
Who else got this in their recommendation after the launch of iphone 12
Next big thing iphones series launch will be &#39;one time use disposable iphones&#39;
This is sick
Apple would never do that as they want to charge you $1000 dollar to replace the screen duhh.
Haha
It&#39;s Tech destruction proof
When i was a kid i expect air plane mode to be something like that lmao😂😂😂
Did I try dropping my mums iPhone 7: yea<br>Did the parachute system work:<br>No<br>Did I get beat:<br>Yes
Wahahahahah. Apple wishes they had such a feature! Their phones are so featureless it&#39;s sad! Yet people still buy them
Who stills watching this in 2077？
Olu thevaiyaane alavu
It’s pointless and will never happen. By implementing CO2 Module what you do is to just taking so much more space where you can fit more battery, ram or memory. It’s not practical and people are more willing to spent money on a new case rather than on a new pointless feature which is going to only complicate the devise further.
Each time you drop your phone you also drop 60% of battery
Iron man be like: 👁👄👁
Who else noticed that&#39;s an iphone 6 not 7
Nice recommend after 5 years xD I never heard about that
No
IPhone 156 : protecting A human from falling... But still no headphone Jack 😬
2020: iPhone 12 &amp; SE 2nd. Gen.  still no parachures
Who else thought it was real?<br>Oh... it&#39;s just me
Best way to cool your phone when your playing gamed
2020 : Iphone 12 . God damn MageSafe
Hey guys I just got widgets in ios 14
Is this real
Isn&#39;t it obvious that it is animated?
Everybody phones be undamaged till it lands on the corner then they gotta pay 500 to fix the damage
It was recommended 5 years later cause this one&#39;s the upcoming iphone 13
Bruh, as if apple would even care to implement this, lol
Honestly this would be so cool to have on a phone
If you found my comment over 10000 comments, congrats.<br>At least it has a charger
If it’s faulty will it explode?
It looks fake because the co² tank is too small for me and I think it will not provide that much pressure to lift that phone itself if it can&#39;t lift the phone it means it can&#39;t handle falling phone because the falling gravity is making the phone much heavier it&#39;s the same like jumping on the weight meter your weight will increase when you land and back to normal when it&#39;s jumping back.
Instructions unclear, there were 3 pieces on the floor when i dropped it off my second floor.
I see tiktok girls intentionally dropping that phone for challenges
iphone 7p
Me at 2015: 👁️👄👁️
ME TO THE VIDEO WAT THE FUCK
I think it exists in the parallel universe .
Apple: The idea we can&#39;t invent it yet.
Last week of 2020, iPhone 12 mini just release, WHERE IS MY F*<b>**</b> PARACHUTE!!!!
WTF
Who else is watching this on an iPhone 7 or 7 plus??
And now only... &quot;XDDDDDDDDDDDD&quot;

This is actually a really good idea
I checked to see if this was uploaded on April Fool&#39;s<br>ended up fooling myself as the date is not even close. Not even 1st of <b>insert month here</b>
When I was kid I watched it and now I am a teenager and have my iPhone 7 but not the parachute my whole life was a lie
Iphone 12 out yeeks
<b>This did not age welllll</b> 😂
Android had the airplane mode and no one is making an ad about that. Absolute blasphemy.

Seems legit to me
Why da hands uglier than a rat
I threw my iphone 7 on the floor but i cant see the rocket :v and my screen like : bye i rest in peace
I thought this was real....
I think its gonna blow  on your face cause co2 tak with high press
Imagine refilling the co2 tank on your iPhone
And there was a time when i belived that this was real
Android phones: <b>I don&#39;t have such weaknesses</b>
In 2020<br>We don&#39;t give our customer the charger because we care about the fucking plastic shit pollution... But we do wrap our box and the useless thing with plastic so no worry, buy apple
Who need gorila glass?
2020: iPhone 12. Still don&#39;t have parachute
Lol they couldn&#39;t even fit a headphone jack😂
watching this on my 8gb iphone 7
Apple saves screen<br>Samsung doing few drops to broke hisself and then you need new phone
2020: still no parachute and they even took away the phone&#39;s charger.<br><br>Holyshit, almost 2k likes. Tks, guys
Why not build a bulletproof iphone instead, it tough enough to handle an impact to the ground
iPhone 12 still no parachute
Nobody&#39;s talk about how genius is this guy
hold my iphone 12
2020: iphone 12 have paracute?
AHAHHAAHHAHHAAHHAHAHAAHAHAH
Now apple release phone with boomerang feature
Ok but that’s an iPhone 6
In a parallel universe too Apple ditched Headphone jack over CO² gas recharging port.
who asked?
Physics: allow me to introduce myself 😂
2 minutes of silence for those who think it&#39;s real..<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>It&#39;s completely CGI 😆
Wow even i phone 12 pro max does not have this features 🤣
Headphone jack... How cute xd
When I was 8 I thought this was actually true😂
2015: Apple will have parachute system<br><br>2020: Removed 3.5mm  jack, charger, headphone
Someone here in December 2020?
What if it drops on the screen side?🤷🏻‍♂️
If it had a headphone jack
JAJJAJAAJAJAJAKAJAJJAAJAJAJJAA
The earphone jack shall be appreciated😊
It’s not iPhone 7 it’s iPhone 6S
The fcuk man,<br>Hopefully some kind of mechanism, similar to this one but of course more practical, will be included in the future smartphone cases.
2020 and i am still searching for a proper charger and earphones in the box i havent found any facking parachute
They wouldn’t do this be cuz apple wants money from repairs
iPhone 7 with headphone jack??<br>It&#39;s more like an iPhone 6CO2 Pro max.. air
хахахахахах какие же были фантазеры в 2015
It has a headphone jack
2020 <br>iPhone 12 <br>Still no parachutes
2020: iPhone 12, Still no parachutes
I tried it and it didn’t work
Is this real
2020 hmmm i dont think so
Iphone 7 (2015):  Parachute System<br>Iphine 12 (2020): Charges and the headphones not coming in the box 👍
&quot;That will cost another 5000$&quot;
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I mean, this is pure madness! Great job 👍 <br><br>But one question, any news of this concept after 6 years?
C’est un iPhone 6
2020: iPhone 12. Still no parachutes :/
This would take up way too much space that could be used for the battery or better parts.
Youtube algorithm : Lets Make Fun of Apple
biggest cap
Headphone jack on iPhone 7 😂😂😂
Some people are so dumb
Just use airplane mode
Lol imagine getting this recommended this 5 years later and it was a lie smh
Hi im from 2020 and you think apple has advanced <br>Actually it has taken off charger and earpods from the box
I trieed with my iphone 7 and it broke
2020: no parachute and they removed the headphone jack and now it comes without the charger. Waiting for them to start selling the screen separately.
If this where to be real on the future, that would actually be really cool, and the only thing that Apple had created, at least useful
FAKE!!!!!
iPhone 12 has special rocket mode to go on moon
2020 : Iphone 12
2019 : Iphone 11
Headphone.jeck.. Hahahahah
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I remember this shit😂
now it&#39;s 2021...
Still watching 2020-21😶
S C A M
2020 iPhone 12 still don’t have it
Thanks but my Samsung has airplane mode ✈️
Do that was a fucking lie
Apple: iPhone 7 is now included with parachuting system<br><br>Also apple: <b>CO2 Sells separately for $999 a bottle</b>
Dec 2020 :  iPhone 12, still no parachute.
This guy used to think that apple will add a parachute system in iphone in 2015<br><br>Actually in 2020 apple : removes charger and headphones from the box
5 phones later, still cant do that
.
My friend suggested me to buy an iPhone 7 when I tried to buy a flagship Samsung phone because of parachute system on iPhone 7.<br>Just imagine how hard I laughed internally.
I did not know the iPhone 7 had such amazing technology
<b>CO2 sold separately</b>
2020 i phone 12 , still no parachutes instead they removed the chargers
XD
Anyone else got this recommended 2020?
2020. Still no parachutes
Well iphone 12 pro max is kinda the same as iphone 11 pro max but im not an apple fan boy tho
i phone 12 😁 smile on ass
I think the parachute system on my phone is failure.
iPhone 12 pro max ultra 512GB 5g :<br>Still no parachute mode 😂
Anyone here after iPhone 12 launch?
Iphone 12 is launched but still no parachute mode😭
Why is this being recommended to me now
Elon saw this and started Space X
Meanwhile Apple launches iPhone 12 without charger.
Shot on iphone
Bhai chu*iya panti utni hi acchi LAGTI hai jahan tak jheli jaye <br>Aur kon chu*iya apne IPHONE ko niche fekega<br>Tere gan*u sa parachute test krne ke liye
I knew it after 5 years it would be recommended
iPhone 12 still no parachute
I think that&#39;s fart system 😅
Anyone here after 12
I got fooled once
paracachute system activates*<br><br>battery:<br><br>oh god please kill me
Yoğammına
you could literally tell it was fake cause apple has never been innovative in this time
iphone7 2050.
Watching on iPhone 11 and I’m sad that this feature is not in my phone.
2020:battery draining<br>2016:CO2 draining
anyone else get this in their recommendations 5 years later 💀
people make these things way too high tech for the time
I thought this would be a complete joke but they’ve actually thought it out a bit.
It&#39;s all fun and games until you drop it on your face while you&#39;re in bed
They thought the 7 would have a headphone Jack 😂
wow headphone jack
Anyone here after iPhone 12 launch
when fart is actually being innovated
iPhone 12 be like
Yo tengo el iPhone 7 Plus :v
iPhone 12, still in airplane mode, no parachute
Cant wait for Iphone Jihad Pro Max with built in bomb.
Bro wtf?
Anyone here after Iphone 12 launch
Imagine it&#39;s falling screen first and just plummets to the ground
5 yrs ago when i buy my first iphone was 7+ and when i saw this i was like wow my phone is soo cool
How it started: iPhone 7 with parachute<br>How it&#39;s going: iPhone 12 without charger
Lovin that headphone jack
iPhone 12 pro max - forget about parachute, there is no bloody innovation. Apple died along with Jobs
My phone has aeroplane mode it can fly
Imagine if it fell on top of a river or water and for a split second you went to grab it and it fell down...
Can I have 5k likes
My phone can fly with airplane mode🤣🤣
No.<br>Apple wants you to break the phone and buy a new one and make it to break.<br>That&#39;s why I don&#39;t have an iPhone
Airplane mod be like : awww cute
iPhone 12: STILL NO GODDAMN PARACHUTES APPLE WHERE ARE YOU
The iPhone 7 is the same as the 6s it just has the A10
I wish lol.
Okay but I need this
Song name?
Me : ACCIDENTALLY DROPS MY IPHONE<br><b>PARACHUTE MODE TURNS ON</b><br>7 y/o me knowing that the phone will survive any falls<br>Also me : throws the iphone from our terrace (7th floor)<br><b>SIRI SOUNDS</b><br>&quot;AUTOMATIC INSURANCE MODE ACTIVATED*
Very stupid design
Well it didn’t go well I tested this and now I have a broken Phone😔
Cool I guess atleast it can’t get scratched
iphone 7... and then now iPhone 12 stil not have paracute sensor.. 🤣
Lol
Looks like a 4chan propoganda
what the actual fuck is this in my recommendations
Everyone gangsta till the iPhone falls on the screen side of the phone
Seing this in the end of 2020 is different
Inspired by attack in titan

Let’s be honest. Android probably will have this feature before apple does
This looks like a game
Me with the iPhone 7: I wish
もはやスマホ型ドローンだなw
That is a iphone 6
I remember when my friend thought it&#39;s real and told me...
You drop it, but realize you forgot to recharge it

Well, all Apple did was remove a hole.
Apple be like:We would suggest our customers that if they want these features then they would have to pay 50% more of the original price if the phone
Hahaha siempre los iPhone se tiran 3 peos
Ok so my phone and my iPad have airplane mode and …
Fake
<b>*tries to plug in headphone jack*</b><br>&quot;WHY ISNT IT GOING IN&quot;
Haha😂😂
I like the real life perspective
Anyone here in 2020, seeing this video and laughing how we use to predict the upcoming iphone and get excited that it’s gonna have an parachute mode 😂
Thats an iPhone 6
Abeey saale...
Katsande meune fene
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I hope my iPad also does this too.
The parachute system would be strong enough for that little tank. The tank would need to fill up the entire space of the phone for that. even so, it still wouldn&#39;t work.
Das dümmste ,dass ich je gesehen habe
This channel : <b>The only source we can trust!!!!</b>
That is iphone 6 not 7 cuz its still has a headphone jack
I got an iPhone 7 a few weeks ago

Alguien me puede decir que cansion uso
I have an iPhone 7 with a headphone jack and running a crappy android ripoff!!!
ironically the iPhone 7 is displayed to have a headphone jack.
That aint even an iphone 7
Prank it.

iPhone 7 with headphone jack and parachute system: €1999<br>CO2 tank: €199
how tf do u charge it lol the co2 tank covers the charger lol
Abeyea chal
Nostalgia
Good Idea
it still doesnt do this :(
Feke
I don’t need epilepsy in the first few seconds
But what if you ran out of gas and no where to buy it?
It&#39;s not parachute it&#39;s RCS mode
Me &quot;sees&quot; Also me &quot;throws phone down a staircase&quot;
If the iPhone 7 is water resistant then why does it have holes for parachute mode 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Airplane mode may actually make it fly, but this one is like someone activating a parachute.
fake
The must untrue thing in this video:<br><br><br>iPhone 7 with a headphone jack
Wtf
Thats not a parachute my dude thats retro burning
Iphone 7 is here but without this fucking parachute.this is so fucking ad
and the gas  will cost 5928436892431038642586343478564378 dollars
But what if it land on front of the screen<br><br><br>Illuminati confirm
If it existed in a single iPhone:
That&#39;s a 6S not 7 and it wouldn&#39;t be possible<br><br>Also that&#39;s not a parachute
Who is watching this in 2020 for fun 😂😂
Apple is slacking rn. Iphone 11 and 12 are pretty much exactly the same and they havent even started on a foldable phone yet
2050: iphone 111 still no parachute<br>edit: i think there will be no youtube not only parachute
That is more fake then the glowstone portal in Minecraft
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought the phone will automatically use a parachute when it falls.
What program is using pleasee?
iPhone 7: <b>PaRaChUtE</b><br><br>iPhone 11: Let me introduce myself
Ist of all, iPhine 7 aint got no headphone jack, so im not stupid
No matter how hard the parachute system will try to protect your phone, atleast the screen will crack
Now less of heart attacks
This is fake the floor is a paid actor
What about airplane mode?
People in 2015: wow a phone with gas <br>People in 2016: this is bullshit iPhone 7 only have good camera😂😂
This could be some special edition iPhone 12 (when it comes out
Fake
41
Yeah, that never happened
seeing this in 2020... CRINGE.
Tasarım güzel apple böyle yapsaydı iyi olabilirmişti ama iPhone 11 de bile hala paraşüt yok QĞQQOKAAKZJSWĞA

What if the phone is falling backwards then due to air pressure it will fall with greater speed that is why companies don&#39;t use the idea
That is an iPhone 7 with a headphone port.
This is perfect phone what I thought
My have bike mode
Yah man it is 2020

Nice joke <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Hey wait 2019 here 🐸
This should litterally be a standard feature
wtf? Ip7 with a headphone jack??
What a comedy bro . I will laugh tomorrow
That is just bullshit. Look at the fucking capacity of that co2 tank! It will probably run out and fall to death! Even more bullshit is the power of the RCS thrusters. I’m gonna say this in caps because it is important, ITS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THAT DAMN POWER OUTTA THE FUCKIN THRUSTERS WITHOUT RUNNING OUT OF CO2!
They leaked a headphone jack
This is perfect
Do the iPhone 12 with à 3d flexible screen
I&#39;m young and I know this is fake cause you would have to refill the air every so often
Apple wants you to break your phone y<br>So you buy another
The biggest lie ever <br><br><br>Headphone jack

I can have a better tech , known as “case”
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This phone would just contribute even more to climate change 🤦
Why should apple solve this problem when space-x has still problems with this 😂
Dumb fuck, this is fake, gay kid!!
Apple would make one that purposely makes your phone land on the screen so you have to pay them to fix it.
I see no parachute
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3J7R6WBJJc&amp;t=48">0:48</a> I read &quot;Add CO2 Gay&quot;

Basically what this is is a parachute that explodes so fast it is no seen
Iphone 11: antigravity system
Talking about parachute.....This phone doesn&#39;t even have a simple headphone jack
its 2019 November iphone 11 pro max has no sign of parachute 😂
What is it cost 😂😂
Instructions unclear now going back to iPhone 4
I’m watching this from my iPhone 11 Pro Max ;-;
I have iphone 7 and it does nothings like this
Seriously? This will happen in 2744
People in 2019
Hahahaha LOL
Don&#39;t try this at home. 🤣
People in 2019: what the Fuck is this
Where is parachute?:)))<br>Like if you don’t have a parachute for iphone
Wtf<br> (Welcome To Finland) I try it on my ip7 and it’s Was crack! :(
What a wrong assumption
Don&#39;t need parachute system I have a nokia
I have airplane mode LoL
Reality:<br><br>iPhone 11<br><br><br><br><br>3 cameras
What if the phone falls upside down?
If Elon own apple
Vouvouvou
Apple : we took out headphone jack to create some space<br><br>Me : please tell me it is for the co2 cylinders 😂😂😂😂
It&#39;s available in animated iPhone,. Who will use 😆😆😆😆😆
This is Expectation<br>Reality:dropped iPhone at 600ft IPhone screen broke
Fake as fuck
hoax
Buy it for 3000$!!
Fake
Looks like great CGI
apple be tripping,....most dumbest shit ever  ...
totally fake as no head phone jake in iphone 7
I bet you this will actually be a thing within the next 5 years.
128k subs sab ke sab unsubscribe kro is channel ko lol
if samsung can insert entire pen in mobile then why con&#39;t you add that gas tank along with our favorate headphone jack...and 2 minute silence for those and who thought it was real and 2 hours silence for those who still think it is real even after iphone 11 launch...
What if it falls in front
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Watching this on a iPhone 7 😂
Very finny
I’m using iPhone 7 and I don’t have any parachute 😂😂😂😂
iPhone 📱 11 with airplane
Fucking Fake
Only open-source Android companies would make this. An air pump would constantly replenish the thrusters while flying or being used throughout the day.  The phone would also hover and fly like a drone in any orientation thanks to the nozzles mounted on a gimbal system. VERY COOL.
LUSO NINYO
And we are calling it:<br><br><b>Hoverboard.</b>
what non sense......<br>if so send this concept to space.x ...the worked for years and are stiffe failing
😑😔🤦
Why is this in my recommended after 4 years
lol they predicted parachute and apple went ahead and removed the headphone jack
Price is just 1million dollars 😂
One minute have 10 sec commercial
They probably know how to do that but would never cuz they neee us to break it so we coule buy another so they could be more rich
People in 2015 : We will get immortal mobile<br>People in 2019:Dame to costita ah aha ah ai

Lol
The hands and the finger doesnt even look human
Nice concept but it’s not even in 11 pro max
fake in 2019 😂
Headphone Jack This Is The Future boy
Wtf from where this headphone jack came in iPhone 7 🤨
Cost of this may be 5000$ for CO2 refill its around 5000$
epic concept
Rip
My whole laipu was a 🤥 lie
Watching this video in iphone 11 pro max.
It&#39;s a concept lol why do you think Apple Made this?
Chinese mobile will win
lolx
Totally wrong
fcuk off ass
Fake

If your phone won&#39;t take fall damage, then how else is apple gonna make money?
Iphone from attack on Titans 😂😂😂😂
Umm...watching this on my broken iphone 7
That&#39;s an iPhone 6
Looks more like an iphone 6
Watching this in iPhone 8. <br>Mine is much advanced. <br>It will touch the ground faster than this...
Parachute? My phone has airplane mode.
omfg is he doing this just so ppl can drop their phones😭😭 i’m dead☠️☠️
Instead what we got was no headphone jack
Mais rácio comprar uma capinha
Why parachute mode when you have airplane mode haha
Troll of the century....
Wow an iPhone 7 with headphone jack🤣🤣
Nothing but just increasing the number of cameras....😂
Wait hold up<br>This iPhone 7 has a headphone jack?!
There is no headphone Jack in iPhone 7
Nigga <b>thought</b> you was gon get space gray and the headphone jack

My phone has pubg,fortnite but no parachute😂😂
I’m gonna try this!<br><b>oh</b>
I am watching this on my iPhone 7

Anyone here after the i phone 20 launch...<br><br>No no one <br><br>Just me<br><br><br>... ill  leave

Came here again and disliked the video
This concept is pretty useless tho, as Gorilla Glass dominates on the market.
Android has jet boosters so HAH
Apple after seeing this<br>Apple: <b>Dumb people there is no place for headphone jack i said</b>
<b>Its all good we have airplane mode</b>
CreAte one of dis sonitdac please I want u to create each u design see if they work
Wow
How much that co2 tank cost.. Umm i got it.. Its just one eyeball..
Did anyone else think this was a joke video?
*Co2 gas tank sold separately
totaly fake but nice animation
Hey we can&#39;t make a good softland technique and you are saying automatic softlanding technique of mobile

Where i can find RCS thrusters?<br>1.Spacecrafts<br>2.This video
My phone has bike mode<br>Better than u
Nice vid man. Nothing is special here. And the back side of the phone looks like iphone 6.
Give me few seconds, I have to go to the toilets...<br><b>HAHAHA</b>
This guy just wants subs. And...🤬
Teacher no one will lie , <br>Apple 7
If apple makes this system then how are they going to make profit by repairing
what if it falls with its screen facing down?
iPhone’s in 2030🤣😂
iPhone 7 - Nahh<br>iPhone 8 - No yet <br>iPhone X - Yesn&#39;t <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>iPhone 11 - Youtube - HOLLY FUCK YOU MUST SEE THE NEW IPHONE 7 WITH PARACHUTE SISTEM!!!
Instead of this they make the back out of glass.....

I&#39;m still wondering how iPhone 7 has a headphone jack
Why am i watching this after the launch of iphone 11?
This is so dumb
Is it real
🤮
It&#39;s have a headphone jack😯
Lol it has an headphone Jack
50% of the comments: “wHy iS thIs oN My rEcOMmeNdeD?”<br><br>Answer: because YouTube can.

O need to learn that riff
This is the best channel of making phone fan-made i have seen so far...
It still has a headphone jack.
Who is watching this film from iPhone 7?
Wish we already have this technology because I recently broke my iPhone 7.
No one:<br>Still no one:<br>Iphone 11:Dude i don&#39;t even have underwear to protect me 😏
this is real ?
These ideas are just dumb i dont mean to hate its so insane man😂😂
why is this in my recommendations
Youtube &quot;Algorasm&quot; recommended this shit
No headphone jack
i think ive bought the iphone 7 without opting for a parachute system,, they didnt give me headphone jack to refill😂
I’m from the future this doesn’t happen
Watching on a iPhone XR
Whose seeing this and laughing at 2030
Where Is The Parachute???<br>Landed As If On Mars! 😑
I expected the date of upload would be april 1st
<b>drops phone face down</b>
iphone case sellers: aight imma head out
I&#39;m getting a 7 soon, can&#39;t wait for my parachute and earphone jack, this 6 is trash.
It’s funny because the iPhone 7 haven’t the jack enter
If u smoke it automatically charges the co2 tank
I was freaked out when i saw this concept for the first time back in 2016......
Well when we thought apple could innovate 😂😂
So many hopes and they scarified jack
Apple selling the  co2 charging tank 200$ separately
Make this a case 😂😂
Seems legit
Yeah iPhone 11 with rocket launch system it can go to mars take a selfie with aliens and come back to earth innovation by Apple
This is a substitute incase the airplane mode stopped.
I don’t understand how this got 14 million views like this is so cringe. And if it were to be true that they were implementing this on any iPhone you’re probably losing the power button volume button front camera and you already lost the headphone jack. What more can you lose now.
never heard of phone cases
Haha este pinche video si se mamo 😂😂😂
2019 anyone???
2049 iPhone 69 no humans no live on earth and still no parachute
Where my 2019 gang
That&#39;s why they removed headphone jack
2019 anyone
Watching this in 2k19 nothing like this lol
This is actually cool <br>Apple : then how will we repair your phone for 500 dollor?
I tried to do with my iPhone 7 and 😭😭😭😭
We don&#39;t need parachutes when our phone has Airplane mode. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don&#39;t see a parachute.....
Just keep it on airplane mode. It should just take off once it falls.
These fucking comments
When Elon musk starts making phones
Everybody look at the description<br>It says Iphone 7-Parachute System <br><b>Concept</b>
Ok tell me why they haven’t started this yet ?
Is it true
Hahahaha who is in 2019
Qhahaah fakeeeeee
How do you activate on 7plus?
YouTube recommendations brought us back together it seems,see ya all in another 4 years.
People were waiting for air jet in iPhones. And Apple removed the headphone jack.
Who else remembers seeing this video back then?
No not even close
Still don’t understand how this would work with a case🤔
Fake, but good idea tho
<b>adds co2</b> Ah yes. Time for another go.
Thats a...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>6
¿¿¿ Hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahaha 2019/2020. ????
Not even the iphone 11 is safe from a 3 foot drop
it’s a iPhone 6....
That’s not even the 7😂
Yeah I see that headphone jack. That ain’t a 7
Dreams and dreams))))
epic
I will pay good money for a case that does this
Da fuck!!?
That’s a iPhone 6
That air tank size probably holds the equivalent of 1 segment of bubble wrap
my iPhone 7 is broken, or I don’t have this function :(
The CO2 RECHARGE system alone cost $600*<br><br><br><br>*Charges of CO² NOT included 🤣😂
Who&#39;s here in 3021?
What if phone falls screen side 😂
I know this is fake, but I wonder if this could ever be possible in the future? Or is this too advanced to fit on such a small piece of hardware.
Well, my iphone 7 has tsunami mode
Looks like a headphone jack
Co2 can only $999 at Apple :)<br><br>Would be a good idea to have irl though
Man... I wish I was this good at graphic design and video development
If it falls with my headphone jack the co2 will make the headphones fucked up
I just tried it with my I 7, now it dosen&#39;t switch on.<br><br>Maybe I should&#39;ve switched on airplane mode. 🤔
2019 : Iphone 11 . Still no parachutes
Did ya know that when I first heard of airdrop I thought that this was airdrop 🤣🤣
Umm recommended in 2019 and I own a iPhone 7
Damn, wasn’t made on 1 April...
Who’s here after the iPhone 11 pro is out
So gay
bruh
I wish this true
How dare companies lie at us that&#39;s so gay
Any one in 2019 and there is no such feature in any  Iphone even in IPhone 11😂😂
Im still waitin for this!
But you need to pay extra to activate that feature ,only 500 dollars more.
WoW!!!!!!
My phone have drone mode.<br>When it drops drone mode activating then my phone goes back.
I don&#39;t think so
This iPhone 7 has A headphone Jack
Headphone jack? Whats that?
nah i prefer my iStove more.
Recommendation
Na they want you to break the screen so you pay for it
Lmao it’s not even a seven it’s a six
Apple 2030 : never <br>Apple 2050: no ! <br>Apple 2100:  we will think about it <br>Apple 2500: nah not yet <br>Apple 3000: fuck said not yet !! <br>Apple 5000: okay guys this is it let&#39;s put a fucking parachute system  in the iPhone 3000s x xr Xs max pro Steve Jobs fhdh#!+)@¥@(sgs plus
Bro wtf my iPhone cracked when I pushed it off, doesn&#39;t even work😡😡😡
That’s a iPhone 6
Stark tech.
This is actually possible it would be kind easy to make
Iphone 11pro max just came out and still no parachute system
MAN YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY FILE AN APPLICATION FOR THE PATENT OF THE DESIGN AND WORK..... WHO KNOWS THIS MIGHT BE TRUE IN FUTURE AND YOU WILL ALWAYS GET THE ROYALTY BONUS, I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO!!!!!!!!!!! WHO THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE GIGABIT INTERNET???? BUT WE DO HAVE..... NOBODY KNOWS THE FUTURE!!!
Imagine putting a case on
This is fake because it has a headphone jack
Lmao this is far AF 💀 apple can&#39;t add one in scrn fingerprint n this is way far adding CO2 TANK N VALVES N ALL SHIT
I am glad this happened to be true for iphone 7 , i still have it and the parachute works perfectly still
Thomas have never seen such bullshit!
Co2 tank sold separately starting at $2000
Show this to Apple
If space x and apple cooperated
Wish this was real, dropped my iPhone 7 a week ago and the screen is fucking busted as hell
Funny how the iphone 7 on this video has a headphone jack , lol.
We need this for the iPhone x and iPhone 11 🤣🤣
Rip
Tbh, it would be cool if they did this
Tried this on my iPhone 7. Gotta say apple really beats everyone in terms of durability and protection.
Thanks for reminding me how old my phone is
Watching on iphone 7
Wow!!!!
I would pay $2000 for this feature on an iphone.
Mobile companies- we have shown the most improvements in past couple of years<br><br><br><br>Rumours- hold my beer
RCS be like<br>(only SFS bois know)
I see the YouTube algorithm is bringing us together once again
Now there is iphone 11 pro max
my ipad has airplane mode😅
Seeing iphone&#39;s prices,an iphone with parashute mode would definetely cost above 10k
this got recommended after watching the iphone 11 keynote
My phone&#39;s got submarine mode.<br>Oh wait I just dropped it in the toilet.....
Oh really it&#39;s 2019
Anyone after Iphone 11 launch?

iPhone 11 is here, still waiting for this parachute system!!
Fake
Lo siento pero me tengo que reir jajajajaja
This  is an iPhone 6
Smart idea
if apple was smart enough to do this
IPHONES AREN&#39;T FRICKING CATS
Is that actually a thing
i tried this<br><br>do i need to turn airplane mode on?
C&#39;est beau de rêver
i phone 11 has launched till now no parachute<br>no headphone jack
i have a iphone 7
It has a headphone jack tho
I’m watching this on a iPhone 7 and I can confirm.
100% real
i work at at apple store its sad that some customers ask for this feture :d
iPhone 11 out no parachute still XD
Already iphone 11 here. Still does not have that function
Fake
Promise I’ll be back in 2022
Who is watching this from iphone 7.😂😂
iphone 11 just came out and almost nothing had changed
Do it in real life you f**k
YouTube recommendation<br>Yes...
Anyone else here after the IPhone 11 launch?
I would honestly pay another 100 dollars of they made a phone like this
Im pretty sure the 7 doesnt have a headphone jack
anyone after the iPhone 11 keynote.?
Aw damn good memories and I still remember that iPhone screen projector
fuck.... it dosen&#39;t work XD
When we thought it would be real
Who’s watching this on their iPhone 7? (I am)
Apple: Extra feature? Sorry we&#39;re even removing the headphone jack.
iPhone 7s don’t have headphone jacks
This would actually be a good system
Proof of iPhone glass or pixel is weak
This ain’t a iPhone 7...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>It has a head phone jack</b>
If this was real that oxygen tank would cost $100000000000000 dollars
Its end of 2019 and we still dont have that so we pay hundreds of dollars to repair our iphones
your iphone 7 is better than mine
Dead ass when I was like 9 when this came out I went to the apple store and asked if this was real they said that they don’t know lol
What is you have phone case? 🤯
this doesnt look like it UvU
Bold of you to assume that Iphone 7 has a headphone jack :/
It would be a really cool idea
Parashute mode omg trash my phone has snake arms
Apple never do that
Fake
بيتنا يطير بعد الي بيشوفه يجي
I think this feature available in 2022
The sad thing is Apple could do that
what if i throw it off a cliff
Apple users:😎<br><br>Android users:💂🏼‍♂️
Iphone 7 - parachute system<br>We invented it.<br>Throw it anywhere, anytime.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23clickbait">#Clickbait</a>
why would apple do that they want their phones to break so people will buy new ones
Nice  but this is not the design
probably more expensive than the phone it self
Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mój brat ma IP 7. Zaraz zobaczy jakie kity mam w tym internecie wciskają

First of all. The iPhone 7 has no headphone jack. Second, the antenna bands are the same as a iPhone 6’s not a iPhone 7’s and third it has a android screen and font on the phone😂. Fourth there isn’t enough room in a iPhone for a cO2 tank and stupid valves and nozzles. Fifth the video of the person holding the phone is a fake computer generated human.this video is flat out stupid and getting disliked
Yikes...
I&#39;m excited for the iPhone7. I&#39;m watching this on my iPhone 8+. Lmao
Wtf?!!??!!

Instead they decided to remove headphone jack.
Fake 😀😀
most likely the reason it does not have headphone jack is because of the CO2 tank or the whole sensor system but i higly doubt its real lmao
If it was real, Elon Musk would love it.

You think Apple would ever do something useful? Of course not. When you break the phone you have to repair it, so Apple makes money 🤑.
Salute you for great design of iphone
,not iPhone 7
What if it fell to your face = face covered with co2
I try on my iphone 7 but it did not work the parachute
Wow it still has a headphone jack
Im only watching these kind of video to laugh how dumb apple users can be!😂👌😏
This would be cool but I bet it will be a thing in the future

Refill of co2 gas only 100 dollars each
I remember watching this when it came out and thinking ‘woah that’s so cool’ and here Iam 3 years later watching this on my iPhone 7...

Omg they added the headphone jack again.

Next time when they make new phone, it should have a feature that whenever we dropt it accidentally it shouldn&#39;t just land safely on the floor but also fly back to our pocket all by itself. Waiting for that model
My phone has been face planted twice but nothing happened and it also is an iPhone 7

Wow.
Fake
lol
This video is for Tony Stark
You should work for Apple.
Um that’s a iPhone 6
luckily my ipad has a shock proof case so if it falls it will not break or get mest up in the system also if it does fall head first the screen will never hit because on the sides are also covered by the case all that is not blocked is the screen front camera back camera and home button. also if the i pad does fall head first on the ground the the sides are covered by the case and the case is on a higher level so it will never crack because the screen cant touch the floor because of the case. 10/10 ipad mini case i have. its great and my ipad will never break and never did. the case is a waterproof material but its open at the back probably to let the ipad breath but when it falls it closes because its on the ground and the force of just sitting there closes it because the ipad is heavy and it will force it to close its because at the back its a little loose so it opens up and plus there are too many reason it wont let water out so yeah its like a water trap the case traps liquids inside because of the shape of the case. now i would like a water proof case when i go to places where it could get wet and my case for always (but without a big chance of my ipad getting wet).  i should stop here  thats alot of words.
That&#39;s called jetpack mode 😂😂😂😂
How much is this?
Watching this on my iPhone 7
you can clearly see that it&#39;s fake
Did you actually put effort in this animation ?

HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAH
If Made by Takata...welllll....ADIOS!!!!
What about if parachutes in your pocket?😂
Just came to dislike.<br>I am 1000% sure that they will not add this feature, even if they could. Because if iPhone have this feature the customers won&#39;t get their phone broken and so they don&#39;t even need to pay for Apple for the maintenance or to buy a new iPhone, that will be a huge loss the company. Because they don&#39;t care about their customers, they only care about customers money.
to be honest apple wants you to break yo phone
Scam
y would apple stop the phone from breaking if the person would buy a new one afger
FAKE

Android users don&#39;t need this, atleast our phones are stringer than stupid iphones breaking
Instead of installing a parachute system, just design a more durability iphone...more cheaper

These already are expensive enough, implementing that would run them up to more than 1,000 dollars.

Woah i didnt know the iphone 7 farts so much when it drops

İt is a joke
u think guys it is real an iphone 7? i don&#39;t think this is real iphone 7
Actually it is a good idea to use up carbon dioxide that causes global warming and put it back out there. (<del>｡</del>;
omg a kids dream
If this is the feature that&#39;s coming in next iphone&#39;s then middle class people will have to sell their houses to get it...
This is very very good
What if it lands on the front face.
is that real

It&#39;s a good idea for apple :)
Ha ha ha ha

เวอร์ ไอสาส
This is bullshit, Apple will never do that kinda of stuff with three phones
ip var
THE BEST PHONE EVER!!!!
wtf was that?? what if iPhone is dropped with its screen facing the ground!! totally shit concept.
This is so unrealistic
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk que mentira
is faker
még az ember is mű nem csak a telefon!!!
why CO2 it can be just air and ligting port is hitting the co2 tank
mm it will come soon. apple says
his editing is awesome
Ok its so obvious the little air tank in the phone is fake but I belive that that&#39;s probably the look of the phone its probably going to be <br>( plz no hate Im just telling my opinion)
Faке 😝😅😅😅😅
jdnd
And what if it lands face down
The eagle has landed
Omg you fucking idiots, just turn airplane mode on...
wow
It is fake
LOL LOL HAHA
I think it&#39;s nonsense
Scroll down to see how many people can&#39;t accept creativity and think bold, probably the reason they aren&#39;t the designers of these products or even these videos
how would the phone know the difference between the floor and your pocket
But can someone make this for real
awesome
Yeeeeeees and the iPhone 7 can make the breakfast and it&#39;s imposible destroy it and he can fly and he can have childs :v<br>ok no XD<br>(sorry for my english i&#39;m castilian spanish)
N&#39;importe quoi
People would drop their phones on PURPOSE just to see a moon landing take place in their home!
In my opinion apple would never do this yes it is cool and efficient but is it really needed that much think about how much you drop your phone and think about how much you use your phone it&#39;s most likely you use your phone more than you drop it would you really want to spend money on a case and co2 gas or just a case I would just spend money on a case so I don&#39;t have to log co2 gas around with me everyday
rlly thats not coming and if its thats about going about 2000 euros
😂
Nice fake imagination
iPhone 7 with parachute system is wish then every people who try to break the phone will quit they&#39;re channels

O değilde yüzüstü düşerse
what is the name of this song ???
Widescreen, instant recharge, parachute system... How&#39;s Apple gonna fit all this into one phone???
No need to fill with carbon bro. The IPhone can just heat up and create carbon that way.
What&#39;s the song?
Lmaooo this is actually a good idea
Clearly not a iphone 7 because Apple it&#39;s self said it will not be ANY HEAD PHONE PORT. other wise great vid. The editing is great!
THIS IS TRUE!! I ALREADY GOT MYiPhone 7 BECAUSE MY BDAY WAS IN AUGUST 2018
FAKE IF IPHONE CAN DO THAT IT DO NOT HAVE ANY HOLES TO PUT GAS LAME

Just a few mods away from an iGrenade
Les say this idea takes off, what if I replace the CO2 with an explosive substance? Or modify the tank with a larger capacity to fit more gas and get a bigger boom? Will iPhones then be banned from airports and other places? What&#39;s going to happen to all that pressurised gas when my phone gets warm from playing a game?

Allez dans un Apple Store on vous dira avant même de tout expliquer que votre smartphone qui a 2 mois a pris l&#39;eau et que sans garantie de l&#39;Apple store ( 150 euros par an) vous devrez mètre 300 euros pour échanger. Contre un neuf.c&#39;est ce qui s&quot;appelle être pris pour un con.prenez la garantie et vous payez 90 euros de franchise au lieu des 300 euros demandes si vous n&#39;avez pas l&#39;Apple carte garantie.apple est une véritable vache à lait pour les nombreux geeks bobos qui ne jurent tel une midinette de star q&#39;Apple à changer leur vie

Breaking new hover boards are catching fire and blowing. Now IPhones are at risk of blowing up
Ya, right

Damn he need some milk
Where do you get all these crazy ideas sonitdac?

Far out that is one heck of a good idea but knowing Apple I don&#39;t think they&#39;re up to that mabey when the iPhone 20 comes out they might do it but you might need bigger co2 tanks Coz look how big the iPhone 6s Plus is, and the iPhone twenty wil probs be the size of a bus!
Here we go a new CO2 emitting device.
I hope they added a hoverboard app
cool but I think this style would be better for some military package dro off js even thoe they have something similar js

iPhone 7 he abi çok iyi
OMG
This real ?
also that cant be the 7 unless they lied about it not having a headphone jack
i&#39;m not sure about this...a co2 tank too fucking close to the batery. ..It maybe become a pocket-bomb if it come too hot.
I&#39;m an android user switching to Apple, and I&#39;m confused. So Apple phones can fly now?
what if it falls on the other side and right before it hits it&#39;s screen the phone boosts and then it throws it&#39;s self towards                           the ground like a suicidal phone
If only people read the descriptions, they would know this is a CONCEPT

awesome idea :D although &quot;parachute&quot; isn&#39;t really a suitable term. You should invent an actual parachute function as well. whereas in practice, a simple bumper is probaby the best solution^^

Good idea. But I&#39;m not sure there&#39;d be enough space for it inside the device because of all the tech and gearing in it. Maybe making a case that has the device would be sufficient enough.

lol vous vous êtes cru dans Iron Man mdr
Honestly I don&#39;t understand why you guys still bother making animation on iphone&#39;s concepts.<br>After almost a decade the latest iphone is pretty much the same as the very first one. All that they&#39;ve introduced was a stupid button that scans your fingerprints, a front camera and slightly better specs every time comes a new model and that&#39;s it. It was a phone for dummies in 2007 and it still is. So why the fuck bother to give to these pieces of crap unreal animation like a fucking Co2 tank that prevents it from smashing on the ground when fucking apple all that wants is to sell this very expensive piece of crap to you and then rip you off again when it comes to repair it charging 3 times what a workshop would normally charge to perform any kind of repair. Grow up you stupid idiots, has been 10 years now.
OMG
BIG FAKE!!!
Apple 

Lol nice idea. If only Apple is capable of this.
Fake
too bad Android will have it first and Apple will have it 2 years or more later, as with all new technologies and features
No offense but I sorta doubt this I mean it would be cool and all but really
this would blow up the phone.
spare me
They said in 2016 anything is possible so maybe it could happen!!!!!!!
so fake
no te lo cres ni tu
Who will put Co2 in hes phone xD
First off all that is a iPhone 6 and you put some things in the video to make like a (kof)kof I phone 7
In 2025 :v
Would be better if they install blades as a chopper! I would use it to shoot videos as a drone :D
bijna
now drop it on its face
WHAT GAS RECHARGING!?!?!?!??! This is just ridiculous..
Is it smart to buy iphone 6s now or should i wait for september to get iphone 7 ?

i hope apple make this
If all of your video&#39;s about iPhone 7 would be true , it would easily Costs 2000 or 3000 dollars
that is impossible, but if possible then no need charge, there is a suck up system.
Thats so fake
The arm and the clothes and finally the phone. Looks like that it&#39;s made of clay
fake
seems legit
Apple have gone fucking mad. they are obsessed with making iphones so thin as if the 6 wasn&#39;t already thin enough. Making phones so thin ruins the feel it almost feels you want to squash the thing because its so thin. People want thicker phones with that can have more longer lasting batterys yet Apple are so stupid they think everyone wants thin assed phones. The thickness of the 5s was perfect and was so pleasing in the hand you felt as if you were holding a premium device unlike the ugly iPhone 6 which feels so awkward. Apple have lost the plot completely and Jobs would be so pissed off with their designs now.
Just make a tougher phone.....................................
like the airports are going to let people in planes with co2 cartarages in thier pockets... what a dumb concept... <br>really good animation, ill give you that
Es como el Apolo 5 versión móvil jajajajaja  perdida de tiempo .....

That would contribute to global warming.. :/
I have a better idea ... just dont drop it and you will save like 100€.
Apple Parachute air cannister now available for only $9999999999999 each
i wish this was real
then it would be worth the price
Haha I wish
Wow dude. Just no. Stop. There is no way. Just dont.
1. this isnt even possible in such a small phone 2. apple wouldnt do this because screen repairs make them money
If this was a thing I would be dropping my phone 24/7
is it true
You can tell the hand is animated
What if it lands screen first? And there will be a problem with people wanting to drop their iPhone so not sure what the warranties will do about it
SO FUKING FAKE
co2 gas ? nigga a phone is a phone , but not a transformer
That is an impossible feature to appear in an iPhone
This is about the most least likely thing I&#39;ve seen yet.
this video is FAKE
It could actually be possible for Apple to implement this into their new phone.
that&#39;s not the iPhone 7 cuz there&#39;s a picture online with release date
Does this exist
Now techrax can&#39;t do anymore drop tests :D
Oke this is just fucking fake im sorry man, dislike
Who show this BEfore the iPhone 4
Nice Photo Shop
im using iphone but are you kidding me what is this shit

Omg so damn unrealistic and fake!!!!
That is cool, but not going to happen anytime soon
fake*
fakr
Not happening.
Companies don&#39;t want to sell durable products, because people won&#39;t buy new ones then
Imagine the liability!  But pretty cool!
If my shuttle to the moon crashes, at least my phone will survIve......
That&#39;s sick
yeah totally real
wtf
Then you have to recharge the CO2 all the time, and it&#39;s not free...
If Only
no just fucking no
FACEPALM!
waw
fake asffff xD apple hasnt even released a homebutton on the iphone that responds to pressure, they just came out with a phone that responds to pressure on the screen. idk if this is a joke but yea
Where is the parachute ??
i have seen a lot of stupid iphone 7 theories, but this is probably the stupidest
Apple said there won&#39;t be ibend in iPhone 7 plus but ibend was cool in iPhone 6 Plus u could just switch between a flat screen or bending it xD btw I have an iPhone but it&#39;s not bent yet
So, what will happen when you run out of CO2?
Its fake
Our genoration is so fucked up :D
Buhahahahahahaha
Fake
would be pretty useful if it was real but would be fucking expensive
It actually doesn&#39;t work like that
this is so dumb
اشرررررردددددد
I&#39;ve seen parachute drotests using drones but this is New to me
So what if the phone falls front facing
How did you make this?
If that shit works im buying it.
It&#39;s crazy xD but maybe one day

Cool Idea but imagine the price
Lol guys,in this vid ,they have shown that parachute system works WHEN THE PHONE FALLS IN ITS BACK,NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PHONE DROPS ON THE SCREEN😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nice teaser,not very practical. but eh,who cares. They always buy them.
It is true the dislike button works
orr..they could just make a more durable phone...just a thought
Mas falso que teta de travesti xD
what happens if its about to faceplant
yep cuz im just gonna have to go to the store and explain why im buying co2 gas for my iphone
This is hilarious.  Great videos.
nice
YES PLS
Eu quero <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brasil">#Brasil</a>
NO WAY
that&#39;s really stupid.that small of a tank wouldn&#39;t give enough pressure
If this would be the real the iphone 7.... This is going to be so coool
I&#39;ll wait until it gives me a better shave!
bu gavurlar yaptı yine yapacağını amk ewqjkjklrjskdltewrt
False
I can fill my ass wit CO&#39;2 and jump off from 3rd floor
it&#39;s amazaing
that system there my friend video creator is called retro rocket retardation system it&#39;s used during the time of  reentry of space vehicles specially soyuz . Not parachute system. at least name that shit caption correctly.<br>:P<br>:&#39;D
Oohhh Its a concpt idea
When i read title &quot;Parachute System&quot; I expected parachute come out of speakers...but he lies! :&quot;(
You&#39;d need more force from the pressure valve and therefore a larger cylinder to resist the weight of the phone prior to impact, otherwise it would be a measly gimmick.. Where would you hide the bigger cylinder? There&#39;s no space on the current iPhone size, and we all know sizes are being reduced incrementally.
it&#39;s animation
:))))))))))) it s nog real
Fake
so fake jesus
fuck you plz
wow.....<br>unbelievable Apple at its best
the fucking hand was animated wtf
Before the video ends. That guy just recharge the CO2 tank and then he drops it. What a waste of money!
My iphone falls at least 20  times a day. Refilling it with co2 every time would be a pain in the ass.
this guy is the best
MENTIRAAAAAAAAAAAA ES MAS FALSO QUE MI MIERDA
Se o iPhone cair, quem assume é o Aécio?
it would cost so much space money and battery life its a funny joke
I have iPhone 5S touch focus for taking photos, it works, but slow.  NO touch focus when capturing videos.<br>I have iPhone 6S Plus touch focus not work.  NO touch focus when capturing videos.<br>How about iPhone 7 touch focus for photos and videos?<br>Samsung Galaxy S7 touch focus works very fast for taking photos and capturing videos.  It&#39;s the pro phone.
impossible
Yea, this is not a bad idea but if you are like TechRax, it will explode in each video
MDS
what about if it screen lands that shit wont work
fake
i think its fake
FAKE
THE SYSTEM PROBABLY COST LIKE A LOT, LIKE ALMOST ENOUGH TO FIX YOUR PHONE TEN TIMES. PLUS IF YOU FILL YOUR WHOLE PHONE WITH AIR, IT&#39;S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO BREAK THE FALL, AND IF YOU PRESSURIZE THE AIR TO MUCH, IT&#39;S GONNA BURST YOUR PHONE. DUMBEST IDEA EVER...
its fake
No
it is all fake 😖
Sorry man, but they going to put another speaker where you parachute system will be..
ı Love iphone
How much do you wanna bet apple watches these videos for ideas
lindo
Too bad it&#39;s just an animation :)
nice concept but the refueling thing is lame
Nice parachute joke 👻
and what if it falls screen facing towards the floor?
These people need to give this guy a job...
Do you guys know if you want real truth go to apple YouTube page instead. Its a idea from a fan.
I wish that would happen someday with apple
2025 it will happen.
This IS So FAKE
its fake as u can see its animated
hacı iPhone şirketinin haberi varmı bundan

Not to hurt anyones imagination but! Just telling u that even if there was a parachute thingy it will only cover up the back which is the least important part u showed that the parachute it coming out of the back and not the front so u should think about it more before uploading these kinds of videos -3-
e se o cel. cair de tela? &quot;/
I love apple. But this would be cooler if this was what they were doing
Shut up and take my money
Nice idea
Airbag would be logic solution :)

what if its facing the other way?
iplane
what if it falls on it&#39;s face? i see no propellers in the front.
Who belives in this is really fucking stupid.
I DOUBT IT
and I think I need flexible phone because my phone in my jean pocket is stiff enough to bother me crouching.
or when the stranger touched the phone, the flow of current seeped into the body will be helpful not to be stolen.
oh it is good idea once we drop the phone, if it  automatically emits air against the ground to prevent from shattering, the screen will be protected effectively.
BC!!!!!!!
omg
i hate these concept vids because there so creative and better than the actual iphone
FAKE !!!!!!! and GAY
I NEED THAT PHONE ALL MINE ARE BROKEN OR CRACKED
I actually always thought about that
So fuxking fake.
Чо гонишь мудак нах это всё спецэфекты
Useless feature

Really nigga?
This is just stupid....
Wow😍😍
thats the dumbest thing i have ever seen, pls stop making/uploading videos
Lol, y don&#39;t u just buy a case like ummm... if u like protection Lunatik cases? If u don&#39;t like big cases then buy a normal case! and if apple would do this shit id never buy that thing, cmon :D
Ghanta. <br>Kuch bhi dikhaoge aur hum maan lenge kya. <br>Kal ko bolo ge isko car Se attach Karo aur ye auto drive karega <br>Traffic &amp; car avoid karega. <br>Kuch bhi

looks a bit to hard for apple to make a parachute  system
good
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br><br><br><br><br><br>FAKE JK JK JK
samsung is the best fuck the rest :D
just make a durible phone made from polycarbonit plastic like the old samsung phones note 3 for example its durrable and not made of shitty aluminum
That would have to be a big phone for that to work right
ele e muito grande
Techrax in the other hand...
if phone down towards screen then what u fucking fools
Nice but it wouldn&#39;t fly with Apple, due to no longer making money off cracked screens and broken lcds.
this is a game
would be best toy for babies though :-D
For what?
wtf i just watch......?
هو هذا الايفون فد شي
Fake
...so the iphone basically has 3DMG
FAKE
it&#39;s not iphone 7 u bitch... its iSuit 7
Can&#39;t stop watchibg thus hilarious vid
so many logic errors, I can&#39;t even fit them all in a single twitter post
Stupid idea
We dont need space ships anymore to go to mars now
Absolutely hilarious :D
Oh my god this channel is the best fake iphone teaser maker wow <b>-</b>
Galileo would have used this from the leaning tower of Pisa
Will it jump back into my hands?

Yea this will never happen
lol that&#39;s just a bit too small tank
hahaha awsome
fake
haha but that is a cool idea thou
if its boom ?? :))))
WOW
People know that the whole clip is animated including the human hand right? Give some appreciation for his hard work in animating cool concepts btw
wtf
This is actually a solid concept, it&#39;s an interesting idea but it just won&#39;t work. I only say this because those tubes are not nearly big enough to get powerful enough airflow, it would be like trying to hold up a frying pan with a compressed air can. Good idea and good animation though, keep working!
Really interesting concept
so fucking stupid
When you see that your smartphone is closer to be iron man than being phone is time to go to bed
как музон называется
Super iphone 7
this should actually be a thing XD
This is the most retarded video I&#39;ve ever seen.
thus phone won&#39;t Have headphone jack... it couldn&#39;t fit because of this co2 jack.
But iPhone 7 isnt gonna have a headphone jack
бред

Du machst echt sehr interessante Videos.<br>Ich würde mich sehr freuen wenn du mal auf meinem Kanal vorbeischaust ;)
😆😆😆
scheiße iPhone 7 ist so geil
so this was clearly made by someone who never saw the inside of an iphone: there is not space for such a tank and when so small it wouldn&#39;t be able to do something like that.
?
مركبة فضائيه ع غفله
siempre he sido samusng pero esta vez apple me impresionó muy buena idea
what if it falls on the other side? -.-
güldürdü samk yhs banda 6s geldid lolo

awesome idea ! apple is just next levelbut i think it is ridiculous becuase its fake
people actually believe that air pressure can stop a heavy phone from that kind of drop.
this is good stuff. I showed my 6 yr old this and he is amazed at this spaceship landing phone.good one guys now I&#39;ve gotta either build this shit or find it cause he wants it for his bday.
Mhm go on...
lol nope
sadly thats is an iphone 6
your a real dumbass huh?
Why da fuck u lying
fake
This is more unrealistic than Donald Trump becoming president.
This will need a 0ms response in order to make it useful
first of all this is fake they are not putting this in the iPhone 7 and apple is not even started on the iPhone 7
No
No. No. No. And screw that music too
is this real?
Wtf is this
I dont think apple would add this but if you make this into a case it would be cool even do its probably inpossible
This make it even harder u have to refill the CO2
will this actually be implemented in the iPhone7?<br>that would be crazyyy
nice samsung galaxy man
you need a real footage with a prototype! then i can prove its real i dont trust you right now...
420 noscope...

WTF?????
Дайте трек !!! 
99999999% fack
We all know this is not a feature of iPhone 7...... Cuz cook only pursuit PROFIT.
I really thought this thing was equipped with a legit parachute, so that when it falls down,  a huge piece of balloon shaped cloth appears.
iPhone7 doesn&#39;t have a headphone jack <br>its a fake video
What happens if I drop my phone with the screen face down, that happens most of the time
Boy
Cool concept but it&#39;s not 9016
Bullshit Apple is too lazy
this is wavy
Wow what idiot went through all this trouble to make this video?
instant recharge , parachute system. why not put on a missile  launcher and shotgun in case of a war. Or  even a x-ray  camera for when you break a bone. A med kit or medical station built in? WTF???????????
Your animation has gotten a lot better
А рука настоящая??
yeahh sure
That would literally be the best thing ever shame it&#39;s not real tho
WOW * - * PERFECT PHONE!! &lt;3

Accidentally drops iphone 7 <b>flips</b> lands on sceen from 5m <b>explodes</b> damnit!

is this real or fake
This maybe is true! Who knows?
,
That&#39;s not real
WTF?
FAKE
if it fell on the screen
ParaPhone I wish that was real
Why not just build the phone from stronger material? Instead of using up space for a CO2 chamber esp when they&#39;re fighting for ever mm of space and cramming things in as much as possible? Cool concept, no company would ever adopt it tho.
that&#39;s cool
Its funny how FAKE this is
I think that this will never happen because Apple and Samsung doesn&#39;t do anything other than copying and pasting their previous phone models and releasing them as newer models with tiny improvements
Fake
They will never create such things because of $$$<br>Fuck you, you have to buy a new one :)
IT HAS BEEN LEAKED THAT THE NEXT ROVER LANDING ON MARS IS THE IPHONE 7!! WE NEED ALL THE FUNDING RESEARCH WE CAN GET MICROSOFT!   -- Apple

What if it lands on its front?
Yok ammina
Nice background music. Can anyone identify the soundtrack ?
this would save phones.  it would make phones not be damaged.  therefore, apple would LOSE money to do this, so they wouldn&#39;t
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Who&#39;s watching in 2016
showing it as concept will be cool but saying parachute system in new iphone 7 thats total bulls**t. Idk why people doe these things wrapped around displays,parachute system, some laser keyboard coming out. These are ideas not new iphones. And apple is one of the companies that lack in technology. Its just their name and design thats it..
i think its bullshit
is that gas made of human fart
That tank is so small to fit that amount of air and some dust can get inside those holes.
this won&#39;t happen
Lol this is sooooo real
it would be cool if it was real
será q e verdade
bullshit
كبير ولا خرى
It would be awesome I doubt that this will ever happen... unless NASA pairs with Apple
SHAKE PHONE AND TURN ON VALVES
Wtf?
yeah sure...
what about the glass part isnt that what we care about most?
CGI🤑 Nice Try
iphon cosmos edition
Like that is happening
wtf is this
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
It&#39;s a great video, and a fantastic concept, but can you not call it like an iPhone 7 concept, I think it would be better to just call it an iPhone concept, I mean we all know they will never do that with the iPhone 7, if they barely changed the original design of the first iPhone ever since, I really doubt apple will ever have something truly innovative and unexpected in their devices.
if only
Wtf...
The iPhone 7 is not having a headphone jack to it
it was animation
SO FAKE
Hahaha of course
fαкє!!!
A terrorist&#39;s new weapon.
LOL :D
I have a dream ;)
hablen español
Fake
It may come out
😂
the date on that I phone is my bday
Amazing idea... The sad thing is, we don&#39;t have the abilities to do that complicated system in a &quot;cheap&quot; way .. But nice idea!
This is an animation
we need to put this co2 tank on the ass of iphone 100000? and if dont see indicator or low co2 and falls from 20 meters and collide it will explode.co2 explode +   battery explode =no iphone. and if it has leak you need 10000$ per minute
What&#39;s is the name of the music please ?
:DDDDDD
what the Fuck i just Saw....!! Swat Kats edition Iphone... LOLZ
fucking vedios
is real this?
I&#39;m not sure the last drop will succeed : )

So funny
Are you suggesting that there is co2 in a phone.  Thats really funny.....how are you gonna refil if you run out. and what about cases wouldnt that cover the holes.  this is flawed in so many ways.
is this at all plausible?
Does that mean i can jump off burj khalifa and expect the condition of my body to remain the same?
really good video for such a stupid thing, the creators should work in video games or animated movies
Wow! I hope that for the next iPhone, it&#39;s amazing...
Fake
Nice idea
That&#39;s sick
Wow
Hi apple can you create akphone47 if you are agressed in the street

so funny I laugh to hard   ...... even I broke my precious bone of leg ..........hahaha
lol so fake its sad plus if the iPhone 7 would be like that a lot of people would hate it cuz you would have to keep putting in the &quot;gas&quot; and I know apple would put those &quot;gas&quot; high in price and everyone would love that but $$
والله من النصب
not ONE of the predictions on this fucking channel have turned out correct so i highly doubt this one will
100 dollars for CO2 tank lol
Good thing if this was real, then I could make an AC grapple hook without ordering the Co2 online
So I can buy Co2 everywhere whenever I want and pollute the environment even more than I already do?
Well only some know that apple have patented this.
How do you know that it will have a Parachute system
a when you use a shake to share app or something like that it will release co2 lol
this will create more global warming
It s tottaly rubbish!
ложь пиздёшь и провокация
Bullshit
So now you cant bring your iphones to the airport because it contains an explosive gas
Your iPhone could land face flat and die
lol you can see its animated
Who liked this shitty fake ? ??
No won&#39;t even happen 20% of Apple&#39;s money is from people re-buying new phones or fixing there old broken ones.
The iphone 7 has not even came out yet
Awasome
Hahahahahhaha
nice effort but no one belived  for one second its real...
FAKE
WTF is this
AHHAha I LAUGHED SO HARD!!
Fake ass bitch 😂😂

I think they should just install a very small cat to insure that it lands face up every time.
If only that was real
So.... If it lands on the screen ... the parachute Boosts it so the screen cracks more than it would have
its a phone not a hovercraft lol btw nice joke

Omg good job
No not true
Lol I was laughing at this idk why
wow
It&#39;s seems like Tony Stark have taken over Apple.

This is the most stupidest shit I&#39;ve ever watch about iPhones
so can i finally jump off a bridge?
Idk wether to beleive this or not. XD
Is this real somebody tell me please
It wouldn&#39;t work, you would need some sort of compressor, because that little CO2 tank would not have enough pressure to push the phone up. Also what happens if it lands screen down, or on its side?
Lol, yea right
wow!! amazing !!
Seems legit
Et pourquoi pas un briquet...? mdr
you guys are taking this too serious😂
KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK LOL
Can this iPhone drive by it self
NEW! The flying Iphone 7...... ar you fk kidding me:|

And then when it comes out, we&#39;ll all be like, &#39;Oh... Well I wonder what the iPhone 8 is gonna look like!&#39;
Apple coming up with something useful?!<br><br>HAHA<br><br>funny
hahahaha wt...
I laughed so hard but I thought about it for a minute this is actually a good idea
if only he wasnt full of himself
If only this was a new feature... Apple would probably sell this new type of phone for 1000 pounds.
😳
is this the new Star Wars trailer
hahahhahahah
idiot
Bull shit
jajajajaajajajajajajajajajajsjajsjajajJajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
Finally a phone that really makes it with the airplane mode
Damn this shit faker than porhub ads saying there are millions of bitches in 3.02 miles away
Omg, its crazy! Apple wouldn&#39;t add this.<br><br>1. Thats works only when your IPhone is charged<br><br>2. Thats isn&#39;t conveniently<br><br>3. Its danger to charge your IPhone with CO2, and it may not work!<br><br>Ssory for bad English, I am from Russia and I have used Google translate some times ;)
This Fuck!
Iron Man is real :o =))))))))
well if that was the case i&#39;d be dropping my phone many a times that day!
Funny Video
Y voló y yo vole de él

Was this serious or sarcastic
That&#39;s dumb
faaaaake
Great animations bro
Who else thought a mini parachute was gonna come out the concept phone? lol <br>seriously… Apple would never make this as they want to make as much money as possible lol… keep dreaming...
They can make it fly but not waterproof    It is so fake
Is..that real ??
fake
So fake
Great! Another way to add co2 too our atmosphere !!!
Word😂😂 nigga plz stop with this fake asf video 😂😂👏🏼👌🏼
So fake it&#39;s not even funny
i hope so :)
I thought it was gonna be like<br>1) the balloons that inflate around Mars rovers when they land<br>Or<br>2) a actual parachute
fake
lo
I bet the maker of the video works for Apple and wants you to buy it so he gets paid.
I&#39;m done
JK BRO SORRY OK😔😔😔
That was fake because my mom works at Apple INC and I told her if they even made the screen and she said not even making the back of the iPhone 😐😐😐
lol what happens if it fall on the screen
I&#39;ve also got an idea for the iphone 7.  nuclear reactor core inside so the battery only has to be recharged every 1000 years. What do you think?
All your concepts are false! I don&#39;t believe you
wow
Cazzata
what is this bullshit ?
mwahahahahahhaahahahha you wil never sit your iphone down again!!!! hahahahahahhhahahaha
Je suis claqué !!😭😂 j&#39;arrive a plus tenir debout !!!😂😝
awsm idea ..but it will probably not happen in real iPhone 7 ..
Ueah ok
because apple doesnt really care about those kind of future tech apple cares about the style it looks and if people gonna buy it
thats good idea but i dont think apple is gonna make that
hhh
First Of all IPhone 7 Doesn&#39;t have Headfone Jack!! It&#39;s Fake*!!!!

The new iPhone comes with Half-Life 3.
Wats next underwear for iPhone for privacy
WTF
Fake
This will not really happen till 21st century
Wouldn&#39;t be so thin if it had the thrusters.
Lol I laughed so harrd!😂😂😂😂😭😭😭💀💀
You should work for apple
cool but a bit overkill as a solution for potentially breaking the device
mdr
hahahhahah LOL
hahahahahahahhhahhaahhahahahhhahahhahahhahhahahahahhahahhahahahhahahhahahaaaahhhahaha<br><br>Wait, you think people will believe this?
Is this a joke? Or...........
iPhone is already serving bullshit things &amp; this one is disaster hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Compressed gas tank in the slim smartphone.Haha wtfuck.But anyway nice concept(fuck Apple) :)
dumbest shit i have ever seen LMAO :DDDD
I thought there was Jarvis inside it.
but why u need a parachute system ......just apply tempered glass or a gorilla glass to ur phone.........&#39;
That will never happen
Such liers
So fake 😂😂😂🔥
dat moment when the co2 tank makes the lighting port not exist anymore lol. might as well power the phone off co2
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fake">#fake</a>
wtf

100 $ per bottle of co2
stop video at 51 seconds. ASSEMBLED IN CHINA!!! 😂😂
Ok, but, what happens if it lands on the screen?
HAHA omg thats the nmost stupidiest thing i have ever seen haha\
arkadaslar ipone 7 nezaman turkiyeye gelecek
that could be great !
What if it landed on the screen?
this is such Bullcrap!! when the iPhone 7 does come out, i highly doubt it would have that as a feature aswell... xD
Hahaha, great job with photoshop, to MUCH laugh...
lol.
What kind of music?
to be honest i would just drop it for the fun of it, anyway think how much thicker it would be to have a c2o tank in and how much it would cost as well as the good chance of the thing breaking and just going of. also how dose it know when to set of dose it use camera?god this is like a flipping rant
ахуеть
That&#39;s so cool!!
it&#39;l be good when this was true
okay first it looked like the iphone 5s and then like the 6 LOL
This would be amazing and revolutionary. A jet propulsion system that small and accurate. Well it would use air, cost 10 times as much, and it doesn&#39;t exist. Plus it seems a little stupid.
yep good luck with that bud
😂 I fucking wish
Fake
Is this real?
ROFL XD LOL LMAO Whats that song?
Fake
hahahahhahahahahha lmfao wtf...........
hahahaha
and screen
That&#39;s not real
best bullshit in the world
So fake even the hand in fake
xDD this is not just a phone this is iron man
Cool
OMG
what if it didnt fall on back
this will never happen to iphones, maybe to android but i dont think so
if it happens apple will start selling CO2 tanks in $500
fake
you guys are so stupid, this isnt in the iphone 6
This is shit. Co2 is also dangerous, idiot. And you video quality and song choice is shit.
Never in a million years 😂😂
What if it fell screen first? Lol
Still breaks
that would acually be sickif apple sees this vid and they do it hats off to them
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
7s added feature to provide co2 from mouth and o2 is omitted
clearly fake
Figo
wooooow
Hell no!
Not going to happen because iPhones are ment to break so then you shall buy a new iPhone which means Apple making more money
If only
lolz my stomach is paining by laughing at this haha
that be awesome
As if :P
This is sick but sadly not happening this lifetime or any lifetime on that matter
I don&#39;t agree with the parachute but this is probably how the iPhone 7 will look
Is that real?
This is the funniest shit ive ever seen :)))))))))))))))))
MAYBE THIS IS NOT REAL BUT I LOVE YOUR THINKS !
r u fucking kidding me
this wont never fucking happen<br>cause apple will make their phones as thin as paper that means it floats to the floor
u wish
u can so tell at the end the hand was animated
This is dumb.
Falls screen first.

😃😃😃😃😃
😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Wtf.
Seems legit
the most stupid thing i&#39;ve seen. yet it was grapically well done lol. but seriously there are so many better, easier, more safer and cost effective ways. case for one? pop out hinges? stronger glass technology? list goes on.
This a joke........ Right....
che minchiata

PHAHAHAHAHAHA can&#39;t stop laughing
But all Iphone fall on the screen side = )
Super cool but I wish

Lol

hahahaha. We all now this would never happen, but is still fun to watch!!
deez nuts
Amazing concept :)
Наебщики
nice idea, but definitely <b>not</b> going to happen
This is without a doubt the coolest concept ever but in reality I just cant see this but it was pure entertainment
не айфон 7
Airplane mode does the same thing!
kkkkkkkkkkkkk de onde? Meu Deus, que engraçado... kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk &quot;CORRE ATÉ O RISCO DE UM CELULAR VOAR&quot; Vamos aí, amigo. kkkkkkk
Only if that was possible. Lol :P
This is the IPhone 6
No mame co2 jaja
so fake
keep dreaming ......
in 2132 this consept is alive :D
I like you Sonitdac , you have big dreams.
Fake
lol
Nice Fake!But it is Fresh
I HOPE
nice effects
FYI, new apple product CO2 tank for unreasonable price
A Iphone 6 weights 129 grams, a small little Co2 tank will not be able to slow down the fall of the iPhone, this idea is so stupid.
It&#39;s fake I don&#39;t know why all IPhone fans make fake videos to make Apple iShit good plz at least show sth real to reflect the best features on this shit but I know u can&#39;t find as shit still shit whatever happens that why u idiot make like those videos
Nice video !
Прикол
great animation
😃😃
OMG!!
This is your concept not Apple&#39;s
dont think so......!!! will ever happen
This could actually be a good feature
Damn airplane mode just got real.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teasertrailer">#TeaserTrailer</a>
awzome idea
its not really any different...
Fucking awsome !!!
Noone buys this...
nice animation
Ağa böyle bi sistem yok 😱😱
That&#39;d be kinda cool but that wouldn&#39;t be very affective in real life situations and there wouldn&#39;t be enough internal space for that
you should be the owner of apple, sony ect..........
All you need is a protector.. That&#39;s it.
A MUST HAVE FOR A SLIPPERY IPHONE (ALSO ADDS MORE COST!!!)

my starmobile just farted lolz more fart to come with false prediction to iPhone 7 so and so forth...We will wait if apple will launch the real phones...not just like this...hover type lolz
C&#39;est quoi cette info de merde ?? Avec un montage en plus !
lol
i know a phone who has this
Fake one
i wonder if someone forget and fill helium inside it
Apple would go out of business, there wouldn&#39;t be anymore broken iphones, therefore no need for a new one...
The most ridiculous thing ever imagined
What if I drop it on Mount Himalaya?
Fake
Seems legit
Well thats just stupid
That a very good idear

FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKA
This video needs Johny Ive touch.
たのしそうw
this is probably the dumbest idea ever
oha amk o nasil bi fake
Somewhere over the rainbow
What if it fell so that the screen was facing the ground when it fell!?!? XD Great concept but has tons of flaws.
Would the system accelerate the phone when its screen face to the floor and make some more damage to it?  Is this equipment useless when it upside down?XP
What happens if it lands on the screen?
wow it&#39;s for real??  this ad just like mission impossible movie they should ask Tom Cruise be an actor in this ad😎
lmfao
Да нет такого уж точно не будет...!!!

مركبة فضائية مثلا !!!!! :3

Just make the future iPhones with harder materials. Problem solved. Wtf kind of childish solution is this?
wtf???
We appreciate the entertainment efforts
mi viene da ridere è un 6s e un telefono sarebbe troppo piatto per contenere delle bombolette di co2
A big problem will be the heat of your hand and the iPhone components on the CO2 tank. Since it&#39;ll be gaseous  pressure will increase as temperature increases.
I&#39;m here to place reality in to this concept. Sure, it is a cool way of protecting your phone, but it is also unrealistic. CO2 is carbon dioxide, which is a gas that is in the air we breathe, but is not strong enough to slow an approximate 3-10 ounce phone. Second, there is now way you can simply afford to refill that tank, because pressurized gases, cost money, so the tiny co2 refill tank would cost around $100. Not only that,but there is now way you can craft a falling detection sensor without placing special materials over that sensor. Going back to the co2 situation, the phone to be casually dropped cannot be emitted as a white gas into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is also a poisonous gas.
Trash
Tradh
I might get a iphone 7 ensted of a samsung galaxy tab 3
u guys are wrong their is going to be 3 types and technology is not this advanced there might not even be a home button and just soooo wrong
YA&#39;LL GETTING TOO cREATIVE
if this was real I would totally get it
Wow now we don&#39;t need parachutes to skydive XD
nice phone.where did you find it
Since it is not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3J7R6WBJJc&amp;t=581">9:41</a> it will make me laugh
brother very good either
not is real concept
good animation
Антигравитация форева!
amk adam ne güzel sallıyor ya
Yeah i just broke my iPhone and i didn&#39;t find any parts that needs to break out of it and make it 3d stuff and cool screens so i need my money back please.<br><br>(jk)
what about the charger the tank is covering it!!!
So Apple can put a parachute system in a phone, but the can&#39;t put a bigger battery..........
iPhone NASA 😂😂
Apple could never do it because they want us to redeem their products from year to year
OK, Ready landing to Mars.

Да да да. В мотоцикле едешь 100 км/ч и он у тебя из кармана улетел, оригинально. Что ещё придумаете изобретательные ребята? Может быть встроенный холодильник или мини пылесос? А что, просмотры и этим можно поднять.
<b>put Phone on table</b> <b>Phone flyies away</b> &quot;Fuck&quot;
buying
this is actually pretty cool though you would have to refill it every 3 seconds
untruth
Awesome concept....
reaction control system and parachute system are two different things, right? what we got here should be a RCS
So are we going to have to take it to the Apple store to get our Co2 cartridges refilled? I just don&#39;t get how this is a good solution. It looks like they kept the 3.5mm headphone jack as well!
Even though I hate stupid concepts this is some solid animation.
Guess this would be made by tony stark (ironman) instead of apple! Cool concept though! Thumbs up from me!
keep dreaming
that was actually pretty cool
Of course it&#39;s fake but the effects are awesome!
屁!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Поржал, спасибо
Fake and gay
อย่าทำตกก็สิ้นเรื่อง
A cheaper and more efficient way to solve this problem.... don&#39;t drop your phone.
Too much space take up it would
This is fucking 3d look at that girls hand boys 😂😂
and if i really parachute? or maybe drive bike fast? my phone will just fly out of my pocket... its bad/unreal concept
This video gave me autism.
Designer makes impossible project in dream, Engineer makes dream come true.
awesome concept, although it will never be implemented into iphone 7
WADAFAK ??!!!
Vous avez vraiment cru qu&#39;il allait y avoir des RCS xDD Comme sur une navette, faut pas déconné c&#39;est un telephone ^^
just sayin, what if you just wanted to throw your phone around for fun haha
so it has the airplane mode..and now the parachute :D
what if we put a phone case
This totally isn&#39;t fake😂
I see I wasn&#39;t the only one thinking about a parachute system.
Best concept in the world
Great idea man! But it&#39;s apple, they want it to be more &quot;sleek and modern&quot; -_-
Ok, I thought this was a dope concept... Until the end with the tiny ass CO2 tank and I was like what the actual fuck
This is so dumb
samsung would be the first to do that like the edge
PLS pls do these stuff more often, i need cool shit to watch
only if it was real it would of been badass

omg XD XDXDXDXD
Смысл от этого изобретения, если обычно телефон падает экраном вниз? Уж лучше тогда пусть айрбаги выскакивают по углам :D
This is a wonderful idea, but it is easier to make a shock resistant device. Sadly this thing won&#39;t happen anytime soon.

how about if it drop with reverse side.......<br>speed up?
R U KIDDING ME ?
Hello， we&#39;re press company ETTV from Taiwan and we saw your brilliant work of iPhone 7 - Parachute System on Youtube，and want to use your video for our internet News Which will be post on our facebook fanpage，and we&#39;d like to get your authorization to use the video, Hope we can get your response soon <br>sincerely ETTV
Ахах в этот бред кто то верит

упадет вниз экраном так это система его вдобавок ускорит
штоблятьяувидел
ahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahha
you know your iphone is shit when you have to fuel it just so it won&#39;t break  (gas prices)
зачем создоватт такие сложные системы, может проще его сделать из небьющегося материала?
wow!!!
SOOO FAKE LMAO
i remember watching, these videos when i was little, thinking they were real.
hoax and stupid iphone

This guy should be hired by Apple<br>He would be emloyee of the century 😂😂😂😂
but what if it lands in the front?
it may gonna happen but not with iphones it could happen with samsung,lg,hawawi,sony ,motorola types of brands not with that sucking iphone which is almost 2 or 3 years back from other mobiles
пиздят
and if it lands on the screen?
this should come with the next iphone since many people worry about broken phones
примочка к гаджету нужная...
Ironman?
A iPhone 6s has turned into a iPhone 7
SO PUMPED TO GET THE IPHONE 7 ! Who else?
Thats total bullshit like that will ever happen
This would litterally never work
this is bullshit
The terrorists will love this idea for traveling via airplanes.
plz add this apple
so if I put some together I should be able to have a hover board?
why do you going to work in apple? your idea is the best.
Have to admit that ur videos are cool
keren ☺
ya llego en VENEZUELA
Vin Diesel&#39;s iPhone! :D
and if it fall at the screen side the gas will do it&#39;s work very well ;)!
Iphone 7 or Iphone 8
Pls do this Apple!!!
so where can I buy for some CO2 gas :)))
класс
Wow that&#39;s so fake because the hand is animated
I think I&#39;ll just put a case on my phone. Also, still a home button and big bezels? :-)
Call me when it really works, not to watch a silly animation...
i just wanna say : LMAO. yeah right
fake and gay!
great now hackers can use our phones as projectiles.....
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk si isso for verdade aqui no brasil nao vai ter mais fila de espera pra ganha rim !!! todo mundo vendendo
That would be great, but Apple is not inventing anymore...
какая же это хуйня, для экономии места уже в лайтнинг наушники переносят,а тут система клапанов аххахаха
Ахринеть, мы в будущем
There is IgAS for recharge the co2 tank :p
pure stupid innovation...ty for waste my mobil data
une coque de protection c&#39;est bien aussi...
iPhone 7 will never CO2 not believe this idiotic commercials, say that just changed the connector 3.5 Headphone
this is the most unrealistic and stupid thing I have ever saw on a phone! like the graphics though.
Айфон говно
Пиздец просто
это же сраный бред
This is not a fake iPhone. I work at Google and Steve Ballmer asked us to design this for Pixar.
Ом ном ном ...... Пахнет фейком !! !!!!
This won&#39;t happen, not yet
How cool and useful would that be 😁 awesome!
They could just make the frame a bit stronger, and make sure it doesnt bend nor break when being dropped.
c&#39;mon guys, it&#39;s just a joke, and a very good one :) well done mate
Brilliant idea except for the CO2. But still good thinking!
You Should built up your own Label and try to actually build some of your concepts... no matter how expensive the product gets i am shure u will find manny interested customers^^
N&#39;importe quoi c&#39;est pas possible
so i can jomp off the cn tower?
если с экраном упадёт будет очен плоха не павтарите дома
Good concept tho
Guys shut the fuck down , (fake fake fake blah blah blah) this guy makes 3D animation  , ideas and some stuff that would be useful on the future , I bet you can&#39;t make like 1 of his videos , even if it fake it&#39;s still possible as prototype , and people could make models like that as test and other stuff , he have many nice ideas
Or get the oderbox defender
You are a born engineer
Why not XD
So fake!
That&#39;s actually a pretty neat idea.
not possible (now?) i think i can create a prototype of that with todays technology... there are hoverboards. ill create a schematic of it tomorrow. i think i can make it on a ipad mini 4... i will see what i can do
Fake
lol fuck this bullshit. it will be out about 100 years later
and epic!
NOT FAKE!!!
YOU MADE AN NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AWAHWHAHAHHAWHWHAHWHHDHDHOOOHOOOHOOHOOHOOHOHOOHOHHOOH
what is it lands on the front?
QUE JATO TIVE QUE I PRA OUTRO PAIS PRA COM CIGUI UM IPHONE 7
facke
i know everybody knows that
You a German People?
Awesome concept, but after being inside iPhones a few times, I&#39;d say that it would not happen THIS way because we all know there would be that one idiot who doesnt know when to stop filling the Co2 and BAM. as well the alarm is right under where the battery (of course this can be relocated near the wifi antenna) and the final thing I will say is the Co2 tank leaves no room for the touch id and microphone.
that is actually a very good idea, but i think we wont see anything like that until 2027 or something like that :D
fake
Dat fakeness doe
Battery life: 20&#39;sec
Wow amazing job! My video sucks compared to this!!!  How did you do this :O
