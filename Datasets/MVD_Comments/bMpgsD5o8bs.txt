Have you watched the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe?
If I could travel back in time I would definetly go and see when Diogenes and Alexander met.
The great philosopher Pewdiepue
I love when Felix makes video essay&#39;s, i hope i wil make one some day soon. =)
People comparing what he did as a minor to robbery‚ò†‚ò†üíÄüíÄ
I think the point of the story is to say, that since the listeners aren&#39;t Alexander the Great, you should try to be more like Diogenes, than Alexander
Ever find the robber?
I&#39;m glad you were robbed so you could demonstrate your honor and virtue
Why couldn&#39;t the douche bag youtubers get robbed instead? Was this in the UK?
i go back to this vid every time
I come back to this video a lot. thank you pewds for the years of great videos
I think this is your best video. Or at least my favorite.
Some very crafty people who were obviously  studying your life and personal details( we don&#39;t  know  if they were Japanese,  the thieves could  have  been  a different  nationality although  it is unlikely ) they obviously  went  for the most expensive  items like jewelry,  they were not bothered  to pick up other stuff  like computers....very interesting,  which leads me to think  they were Japanese nationals......wow....I would  never  have  thought  that  about  the Japanese.....You should  also be very careful  you share a lot or personal  information  online like your real name and signature on Wiki, I would  remove  that if I were you.....( just a concerned person  out here who cares).
I‚Äôm watching this because my house got broken into but luckily I‚Äôm moving soon. Lost around 10k worth of item. My Xbox series x stayed though yipeee ü•≤
Best story about Diogenes is featherless bipedal.
Phisolphy is in gaming conquer bad fur day So here I am king. King of all the land who&#39;d thought that. Huh not me I guess you know who these guys are now I certainly do I don&#39;t wanna know them and yep I may be king I have all the money in the world and all the land and all that stuff but you know I don&#39;t really think I want it I just wanna go home with berry and dunno have a bottle of beer hmmm it&#39;s true what they say the grass is always greener and you don&#39;t know what it really is you have till its gone gone gone conkers  bad fur day 2001
All the  information you listed about Diogenes come straight from Diogenes Laertius (180-240 AD), whilst &#39;the&#39; Diogenes of Sinope died in 323 BC. Most of Diogenes Laertius&#39;s writings are based of his personal knowledge complemented with some quotes of other writers, there exist no written documentations of diogenes of Sinope.
Ironic people not caring about you getting robbed is kinda stoic sysm I spose I can&#39;t do anything about it so I don&#39;t care idk sounds a little right maybe
Plot twist it was the guy he scammed on Tibia getting his revenge
plot twist: Diogenes robbed him
I fucking love you pewds thank you for this video i rly needed it aftet losing $240
Enough about Diogenes,Even though he has a point ,going against society or consumerism is counterproductive, there‚Äôs a reason people don‚Äôt die at 40 anymore. His way of thinking is out dated, with history laid out before us, and such knowledge of human nature, anyone who agrees is just ignorant to me. Off topic but if you like philosophy, I definitely recommend the Goat Miyamoto Musashi,
I just watched this video on Sam onella‚Äôs channel but less depressing
This has got to be the most dumbest and pointless sh!t I ever seen
Plato the best though.
Diogenes was a great philosopher.
I just read Ward No. 6 by Anton Chekhov, and it made me remember this video you made. You should read that, if you haven&#39;t already, and it will change your mind on Diogenes.
Diogenes is probably the most based individual to ever live
That&#39;s cute
Is there a book of this I can read or is this just info
What more is there to be said..
I feel bad for pewdiepie <br>1 like = 1 item brought back to him
I hope the thieves have watched this video!
Lol me thinking back to the getting over it series Diogenes was the sledgehammer man
I love this kind of video of him I learned a lot seriously.
2 years later, this is still one of my favorite videos on the internet. Man, gotta love pewds, thank you so much for this, I learned a lot.
I know this video is old but I&#39;m catching up. Why would they rob you and not steal your expensive computer equipment? Did they not check that room or something?
Jesus fucking christ twitter is a dumpsterfire hope Elon will burn it down
This is my favourite video, and I legit thought it was like 20-30minutes long but it‚Äôs so damn good
Pewds: <b>talks about philosophy</b><br>Me: &quot;I like your funny words magic man.&quot;
I&#39;m into philosophy a lot more now. I think it was cool that Diogenes respedfee dogs
Millionaire lecturing people about money not making you happy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=310">5:10</a> at this point, did they know that the brain does the thinking yet?
There is an anecdote about Alexander and Diogenes‚Äô meeting that goes: Alexander said ‚Äúfinally, the emperor is meeting the beggar‚Äù. To which Diogenes replied ‚Äúyes, but you are confused as to who is the emperor, and who is the beggar‚Äù.
what is the name of book you read?
I was robbed a few times. One time they robbed my laptop with pictures of my daughter inside. I could never recover that pictures. <br>Some people don&#39;t understand the implications of robbery. I&#39;m sorry for your losses pewds.
This is the philosophy I enjoy the most, our things are just that &#39;things&#39;, what good is wealth when you die.  It&#39;s better to have the experience than the wealth.
The true #1 no matter how corporate it may get you are my #1 always.
Haha
Bruh pews needs to be a history teacher
I wonder who it was and if they knew exactly who they were going at
i know pewdiepie is humble asf but how can he have a box tv and a kitchen the size of a small table and be worth 100mil + something don&#39;t add up here
this is your 4,000th video
‚ÄúI find it funny I lost more items reading about him than actually getting robbed did.‚Äù
The story of floorgang ü•≤
More More More, please we need more of these
XYZ, then...
I lost it at Diogenes shitting himself to interrupt Plato&#39;s lesson
Diogenes the real BASED GOD
Such a good video!
The people who don&#39;t care about him being robbed have never been robbed. Home invasions and personally being robbed is a whole different experience than what any privileged person could ever imagine. I can try to describe it but nothing can really be felt and known until you yourself have experienced it.<br>Regardless of him being &quot;wealthy&quot; it still will affect you, if not financially than emotionally and mentally.
Respect
Chad Diogenes
diogenes is an absolute madlad
that robber aint from Japan. Japanese people are polite :D
Wtf why is there a Local Basque Television clip
I just found out that photo of Diogens was in the game Getting over it. Watch pewds part three of that game. You will see totaly different pewds from this one üòÑ
does anyone know the book he read on Diogenes?
Diogenes: literally owns nothing but a wooden bowl<br>also Diogenes: &quot;What am I? Some kind of gluttonous hoarder???
Proud of uüëΩ
The wisest man we all know .Pewdiepie
It doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s rich and he gets robbed, it&#39;s still messed up and not okay. I hope they get to be happy in their home in Japan (when they finally get to live there)
Damn my apartment got robbed today same situation my gfs stuff mostly feels like someone told me to bite the pillow and close my eyes smh
XYZ, then
Does anyone know what book pewds was reading?
pewds when he gets robbed:<br><br>hey i&#39;m gonna talk about this guy shitting on the ground
I wasn&#39;t listening for 2 minutes and now felix is talking about a man who drinks water with his hands and lives in a barrel.
I remember watching this video and it ending up being a lot more serious than I thought it would be
I‚Äôve watched this video like 10 times
I know I‚Äôm late but when Epictetus had an iron lamp stolen from his window, he says this: ‚ÄúI lost my lamp, because in the matter of vigilance, the thief was a stronger man than I.  But he bought his lamp for this price: for a lamp he became a thief, for a lamp he broke his faith, for a lamp he became a brute.‚Äù  Just a lesson that anger is unreasonable.  The thief gained some (in the end) useless material things but he did not understand he was losing his integrity.
Why did put such a thumbnail on a series video
pewdiepie get robbed and now he is smart what????????
I wonder what the japanese police did with this case, japan is famous for their 0 crime rate, so how did the police handle this?
completely forgot this was a pewdiepie video 1/3 through i thought i had accidentally clicked some real life lore video haha
Diogenes actually followed epicurean philosophy which was about getting rid of desires<br>But according to me in this time<br>Everything is done for the desire we have
Wise to look for the lessons to learn from an experience like that. Easy to give into anger and fear. Why Pewds is a legend!
What are you speaking what is diogenioes
rewatching this video a year later and i still love it. please make more philosophy videos felix ‚ù§Ô∏è
It once again shows, that Twitter has the most superficial and close minded community ever.
What a frickin legend, man, both of them. Felix for turning a negative event into a teaching moment for his fans, and Diogenes for being Greek, or something.
Remember what you did in the past sometimes it helps you understand
When you said he lived in a barrel....I&#39;m just thinking back to the times where you used to scream BARRELS in a fit of rage and destruction, Maybe you killed him!!!! <br>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your house bro, Hope everything is ok
I‚Äôm new on here, and I know this was a while back, but damn. This was a really beautiful. Feeling violated after some stranger breaking to your home that your suppose to feel the safest. Great words Felix.
I come back to this video from time to time. It‚Äôs so well made and makes me think about what I derive value from in my life.<br><br>It also reminds me that Felix is far smarter and deeper than many of us give him credit for.
Always funny when fascists get robbed
This man has gotten rid of his rewards just think about that he humbled himself to see that he doesn‚Äôt need the trophy to know that he accomplished things seemingly impossible for a single person (not company) to achieve
I‚Äôd never heard about him before this video but thanks Pewds ima have to look into him more
Who knew pewds was a boomer &quot;ITS A JOKE ITS A JOKE&quot;<br>-A wise sweden man
pro tip: dont want to get robbed? dont have anything worth robbing $$$
My favourite philosopher: Play-doh
The people celebrating him getting robbed are the same people who showed up at his house
This has got to be one of your best videos.
Should&#39;ve picked Crates
whats the background music its really good
You can&#39;t rob a man who is not a materialistic.
watching this again because dazai lives in a shipping container
So Diogenes was an ancient hippie
I&#39;m new here, his wife&#39;s jewelry got stolen? Cool reading a script sir. Put alot of thought into this one?
I got really amazed Diogenes story what book was that
This is what I call Buddhist Belief.
I once heard a story.. a young fish was with an older fish. The young fish said to the older fish &quot; i want to be in the ocean &quot; &quot; you are in the ocean &quot; replied the older fish. &quot; This isnt the ocean, this is just water, I want to be in the ocean! &quot;.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=357">5:57</a> <i>floor gang</i>
nice
Robbers are pure assholes, they steal because they didnt make it in life.
wait wait wait... You&#39;re 2 most valuable items are your camera and computer. Man you are one humble guy lol.
I learned so much.
BARREL
The language and expressions are so good. T_T
Do y‚Äôall know that Diogenes claimed to be ‚Äòclose to nature‚Äô, but rather than trying to make some effort to survive in the wilderness or remove himself from society he would beg in the cities for everything, steal from temples and people because ‚Äòthose with knowledge of truth should be rewarded‚Äô If u want a more thought out version of this philosophy maybe look to stoicism, but as someone who is studying philosophy at college I don‚Äôt think Diogenes is the answer
That TV tho.
Music name?
Whenever i am sad i watch this video
Pewdiepie acts dumb, but he&#39;s actually big brain.
Diogenes. What a madlad
Diogenes was floor gang because he has dio‚Äôs genes
I dont get why people hate rich people. Just because they have more money, doesnt mean they should pay more, as with percentages, they already pay more than poorer people
Hey its meee Lily in among us purple with a pet and a skin
Pretty sure that the robber was a pewdiepie fan....he broke into the house and saw all the awards and setup
He just held his breath. And died. A fuckin legend he was
damn, twitter is sh*t
It was very traumatic
&quot;i find it funny how i lost more items reading about him rather than actually getting robbed&quot; damn that hit hard
Tbh, carrying a bowl around is tiring
Funny how I ended up watching this video after going into an hour long panic from a completely unknown charge on my credit card.
He got rid of his awards damn
these videos are so deep
‚ÄúWhatever they took was from my wife unfortunately‚Äù<br>I‚Äôve watched this before but it sucks getting robbed, never have been but they got made fun of or supported, pewds even feels bad Marzia‚Äôs stuff was stolen and the fact Marzia was sad ofc about missing all her things she still knew it was materialistic and kept her head high and was still happy with what she has :)
pewdiepie has millions yet still owns a crt tv
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=230">3:50</a> My man
I&#39;m glad this is the kind of man I stan.
Diogenes flamed Plato so had with that comeback lol. <br>I really liked this kind of content.
Diogenes is a perfect example of Aghori
E
for real i wish the people who find it awesome he got robbed no luck in life i hope they get robbed and have to live on street
I would boobie-trap my house all over the place.
Maybe he has millions, but he worked hard for them. And those who are saying that he&#39;ll be fina are just 15 year olds that gets money from mom for cleaning dishwasher. They dont know the real value of money.
This video should get subtitles in every language there is, even the dead ones.
I&#39;m sad :-(
For once, he speaks so wise.
thankyou for reading the book cauz i am lazy lmao
have Pewdiepie ever been this serius???
I&#39;m 14 and this is 14.
me: wow this is amazing<br><br>felix: he would shit on the street, and if anyone made fun of him he would respond by urinating on them<br><br>me: <b>*chokes*</b>
All the philosopher backstories start with a raob
alas, I can finally use Pewdiepie&#39;s Philosophy for my assignment. many thanks bro.
Oreo
I was laughing after hearing how he died , What a troll!!
Ans checkout the merch...
Have u gone mad, lad?
Wait you threw away your 50 million play button. Okay wow
pewdiepie makes a sad or a informative video <br>2 mins later: so their was a greek philosopher.
I like the philosophy  :)
Isn&#39;t it sickening that people are actually happy that he was robbed? Jesus I even found comments before saying that he should get robbed again
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=218">3:38</a> why do y‚Äôall like this dude wtf nigga
barrel
We need more videos like this
What books are best to read to find out more about Diogenes? I found this very interesting.
Thank you for the recommendation, youtube
What book did you read
not gonna lie the house interior is kinda ugly
r/im14andthisisdeep
with a break in, its not about the items its about losing the feeling of safety and security in your home the place you live. i dont wish that on anyone
is there a good book about the philosophy of Diogenes?
Geez, Pewds. I love the info. Big brain. Bring us more big brain moments.
I don‚Äôt understand why 9.8 thousand people disliked this video like at that point you‚Äôre just hating without a reason
We need a movie about diogenes
Pewds: Gets robbed<br>People: I wanna see his reaction<br>Pewds: <i>UNO REVERSE CARD</i>
With all his flaws, I&#39;m so happy this man is the number 1 youtuber.
the fact that i&#39;m actually using Pewdiepie to help my degree...
maybe the thief was Marzia&#39;s simp?
FELIX SAID ‚ÄúWIFE‚Äù !!!
Haters: Fxxk him<br>Also haters: I JUST WANT ATTENTION
That last sentence...
You need to buy a gun what if you were there at the time of the robbery
i love this side of felix <br>would love to have some philosophy related audiobooks read by felix
This video is 10 times better than any vsause video
hey videos like this really good btw pewds keep it up!
Anyone have a good book about philosophy
I am so glad that youtube can bring up creators like this.
You thought it was Alexander but<br><br>IT WAS ME DIO! (genes)
for a moment i thought i was watching tedx talk but so warming.......  &lt; 3
Barrel Gang HUH
this audiobook was 10/10
another one of my fav pewds vids
You should start pewniversity.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=301">5:01</a>, I&#39;ll have to look into them eras as in, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle &amp; Alexander (of which I used the acronym SPAA), not to mention Diogenes a bit more in-depth
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=168">2:48</a> I itched at that very moment
I feel bad for you
Philosophers haven&#39;t died out, they&#39;re just on youtube now instead of streets.
POV ur watching this again because you have to do a report on Diogenes
Diogenes is like one of those chill anime characters that doesn&#39;t care on anything
Pewds get&#39;s robbed<br>Everyone - he&#39;ll be alright<br>Pewds - *philosopher has entered the chat *
Pewds, I just want you to know I&#39;m gonna use this for my Ancient Greek class.... I&#39;ll be skipping a part (you know which) but other than that this is great.
Why tf am I seeing this video now????
R.I.P Pewdiepie
shit, i forgot that he become a philosopher in this video
First time he did philosophy on Youtube
I robbed him bruh
Pewds: gets robbed<br><br>Also pewds: I need to call Felix Kjellberg
üò≠Poor pewdie...
This is not epic
Diogenese was OG floor gang
Ok hold the fucking phone...I‚Äôve been subbed to this guy for years YEARS!!!!However I‚Äôve seen a million meme reviews and other dumb shit to be like wtf is going on. HOW FUCKING EVER, this video was so inspiring. Idk why I‚Äôm seeing it now but like damn this actually made me think dude
What book did you read recommend me something
robbery turned history lesson
spspsppspspss
I always come back to this video to refresh my self
Wait back up you got rid of your awards?
hes using 100% of his brain
Dude you gotta talk about the books that you read.
Man is rich so he is fine so he could replace his stuff
I like how he&#39;s honest
U mystic or something
a man of wise words
The way they turn multiple pages at once in those stock videos bothers me.
pewds taught me more history in 5 min than my history teacher does in 180 days
Holy fuck this was in 2020?
This is the same man that spits on his ceiling that spits back at him.
Also I&#39;m sorry pewds about the robbery i really can&#39;t anything about it but i hope u get the things back that were stolen from u‚ù§Ô∏è
What got stolen?
Lol the guy was  annoyed
To be honest, it takes a certain living standard and quality and above to be able to say you don&#39;t need something and less is more. Whatever you gained, whether it is an object of recognition or object of memory etc should still be retained. It&#39;s to remind you of your milestones and how far you have come and worked hard for instead of them being something to brandish about.
Then Bennett foddy get inspired by this.....
Watching this video for Greek gods essay be like... learning about Alexander the Great right now
Leads u are awesome. U told something that tells why u are amazing.u deserve to be the king
That was nice Felix and that was knowledgeable
I love the fact that I‚Äôm Greek and Pewds knows more stuff about Ancient Greek
Wasn&#39;t this video supposed to be his reaction after he got robbed???<br>üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ironically, I find this stoic.
&quot;Pewbiepie robbed not epic&quot;
Lol pewdiepie now just screams and hits his tambourine. He was so much smarter 6 months ago
Why would u get rid of your sub awards<br>Wait this was a history lesson
Felix helped me find a thesis for my philosophy class. Thank you!
coming back to say thanks to pewds, my teacher was pretty surprised when i talked about diogenes my own knowledge, love u pewds
Pewds planning to live in a barrel btw great history lesson
I love how you can tell hes trying to stop himself from laughing when he says masturbating in public <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=230">3:50</a>
He should become a philosopher.
Teachers: Do you want to live on streets and have nothing to do rather than school?<br>Diogenes: Yes
Just because he&#39;s rich, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right to rob him. He worked hard for what he got, and he&#39;s a really kind person. The people congratulating the thief are just communistic, lazy jerks.
Yo mama
u so smarrtt
Thief: * robs him *<br>PewDiePie: Let me just flex my philosophical knowledge on to you.
The robber watching this: üòû
I feel really sad for Felix arvid ulf kjelberg <br><br>I will always support you my best friend. Well you won&#39;t know that I am <br>Your best friend but remember I will always support you
After few months: Tambourineeeeeee
what is he felix or pewds?
Even though he acts really dumb sometimes, pewds is really smart
I wish i could be like diogenes , doggos everywhere , do what u hv to do , life isn&#39;t that complex and you are fine and happy with what you have . The more simple it is the more happy it is .
This is what happens when you kill  Ainsley  lol
Me sees title- üôÑ<br>Actual vid-üëÅÔ∏èüíßüëÑüíßüëÅÔ∏è
This video came out when it was very necessary for it to do so. Congrats pewds. We love you.
You good
i had a religion exam at school today and there was one question about diogenes and i remembered about this video. Thanks for your education Felix :)
Do more of this Pewds!
;(
Nooo marzia
Pewds has so much yet he‚Äôs so humble and is smart and knows his facts
eat the rich
Me gets robbed<br><br>YouTube:let‚Äôs recommend a video half a year ago to him the day he got robbedüòÇ
üòØüòØüòØ
This isn‚Äôt thoughts on getting robbed. This is actually a history lesson
Every time I make a decision about Felix and he comes with a form that makes me think about my existence. God bless you.
I love <b>philosophical</b> (angry) Felix
U should do more philosophy videos
If I was your teacher, i would give you an A+PP
Diogenes was found to be counterfeiting coins and was exiled , living like this was not is his choice.
It felt like i am in history class
What an awesome video &lt;3
Diogenes didn‚Äôt eat the fruit off the tree
Pewdiepie: I got rid of everything I don‚Äôt need<br><br>Pewdiepie a couple months later: has billions of tambourines
well I learnt something today, thanks dude
Why would you steal a laptop or phone, you would need a password
*buys 50 tambourines
Class! It&#39;s time to learn with PewDiePie!
This was made by the same person who just bought over 50 tambourines
i thought this was bright side when i checked the channel it was still pewdiepie
Was Pewds robbed in Brighton or Japan? I‚Äôm a bit confused.
I&#39;m kinda late to this... But i was not expecting to have a history class from felix
<b>He is the Messiah. All hail Messiah</b>
I really love this channel now, always funny stuff and sometimes stuff to make you think, greetings from Colombia (South America)!
&quot;In a rich man&#39;s house there is no place to spit but his face.&quot;  - Diogenes of Sinope
I just find out that they were robbed and I feel awful for them and double that they had to face so much negativity üòîüòîüòî
Wow that must have been very unerving pewds....im glad ur both safe ans doing well
Dude just sounds like a crazy homeless guy tbh
when i am outside with my dogs.. i sit on the ground with them. sometimes i wanna just lie outside with them and be with them,. that must be my inner Diogenes..
wow dis deep
this is a fucking history lesson , not thoughts about getting robbed
I have a feeling that those people that celebrate his robber got super destroyed by us fans
i was on the front page of youtube and read the title very fast so it looked like &quot;Toughts on getting Rickrolled&quot;
me comes to wach pewds me big brain
sorry to hear that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=121">2:01</a> the meme
I hope the thief steals from pewdiepie again
r/iam14andthisisdeep
saitama felt the same. he has power but he wasn&#39;t satisfied
Bruh u got robbed and decided to make a history video, ill start taking notes
I can t believe this guy he robbed the greatest youtuber in the world asshole
The people making fun of pewds and Marzia, the ones CELEBRATING??? Disgusting.<br>How sad and empty can your life be to think like that?<br>Just basic people doing basic things smh
I never knew about this so that explains why felix has a resentment towards the  YT playbuttons because he would most likely not been targeted this way if he didn‚Äôt have them so parting with the YT awards makes having less irrelevant items around to worry about so he ditched them personally I would be the same if someone invaded my home it would put me off wanting to keep stuff that has no meaning but it also puts you in the situation of having less but the important thing is he still respected for his personality and not for his YT career
Pewdiepie, you are no Diogenes.
Deep
Diogenes was floor gang.
Deep
This video is just fundraiser to buy his stolen items
or just get an alarm
You forgot one of the best moments of Diogenes. When one of the philosophers said ‚Äúa man is a featherless biped‚Äù and he came in with a plucked chicken and exclaimed ‚ÄúBEHOLD! A MAN!‚Äù
chad diogenes
I just want to say...<br>I feel my heart crack<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>. <br>Big F for you, felix..
I still see people saying that he is a millionaire and it wont affect him much... This wasn&#39;t about getting robbed off their expensive stuff but the feeling of insecurity in your own house.... Celebrities are also humans and they deserve their privacy and their location to be private
I really like pewds philosophy videos
&lt;3
That&#39;s Why YouTube Celebrity<br>Doesn&#39;t Expose Their Location<br>By The Way Who Ever Trying To Expose YouTube Celebrity Location Please Stop It<br> It Causes Danger.
Even though the Robery was some time ago, I am extremely sorry that this happened to you Felix. Floor gang for life
every time i watch pewds philosophy video ‚Äò my brain grew 10%
Pewds talking about philosophy is cringe
&quot;I don&#39;t care about people making fun of my house getting burgled &quot;<br>Makes a whole ass video about it
I wasn&#39;t expecting to hear about philosophy but I&#39;m not complaining. I love this. I love pewds so much üò≠üò≠ and boomers say he&#39;s a bad influence? Because of him I became even more interested in philosophy.
Respect
i feel bad for pewds, but, I also think that his really lucky, because the thieves did not discover Brad and Sive chained in his basement
Pewds : Getting robbed = Diogenes story
&quot;I find it funny how I lost more things while reading about Diagnoes , than actually getting robbed&quot;
i want to see the cctv footage
That‚Äôs why famous people never share they address
Good
I enjoy this
This really helped me on my philosophy final exam. Thank you
Never forget that Pewds getting robbed led to that Nice Guy meme.

Diogenes living in the streets of 4th century= <b>Philosopher</b><br>Diogenes living in the streets of 21st century = <b>Homeless</b>
Hey pewds, can you tell us what items were stolen. In my country japan surplus are a thing here. So maybe your items are might be here.
imagine the robber being a host on lwiay when pewds and marzia leave the house <br><br><br><br><br><br>(no hate)
diogenese sounds like a crazy hobo in Los Angeles
you are a good person pewdiepie.
This video went from a video covering a robbery, to my history class
this video is already cool then seeing Yugi vs Kaiba wow awesome.<br>me too. we have been robbed once. it was a terrible experience...<br>I lost that tiny Sony portable TV that has sentimental value, the robber should have just taken the money but not that tiny tv. it was from someone very special.
I was about to get robbed I was like Nani me:moves Tred mail to the door
Im pretty sure that this is just a history video instead of thoughts (this just my opinion dont get offended)
Does this also mean he threw out the 100mil play button?
They have some balls to rob our king
Pwedipie I now who it is Ea vlogs
I got robbed today and I lost my $2300 pc and the whole house was looted I‚Äôm crying rn
Man ngl this turnt into history class mad fast
Who did it
Haven&#39;t been online for 4 months and I just came back and heard this I&#39;m really sorry to hear that this happen to You and your wife üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Is pewdiepie watching Xavier: Renegade Angel??
Coward I can‚Äôt believe this is the number one YouTuber. I never seen such a coward
I never seen such a coward in my life. Gets robbed once and then throws away everything. Smh, I like how this idiot let the robbers win üòÇ

This is the difference between Pewds and others meme/joke/vloggers, he strives to be himself, and make himself better, if people are watching or not.
diogenes roasted tf out of plato
I would love to find the people who celebrated your robbery and rob there house and laugh and say ‚Äúit can be replaced‚Äù pewds I‚Äôm glad nothing sentimental was stolen
yo i almost cried
i wonder if this is why the big Youtubers dont do face reveals
This video should be titled story of diogenes
Why on earth would you throw the playbuttond
The best part of the Alexander story is that Alexander says ‚Äúif I were not Alexander I would wish to be Diogenes.‚Äù And Diogenes responded ‚Äúif I were not Diogenes I would also wish to be Diogenes.‚Äù
Who else wants PewDiePie to read us stories more often
I cant believe Pewds got so philosophical over a robbery.Nonetheless,I feel good for him that he has noble thoughts.
this went from well shit to literature class real quick
Imagine being back in like 1500 and seeing a fucking legend taking a shit on the sidewalk
damn, dude...
How did he eat??
Probably look into getting a security alarm, if you could.
He just kinda sounds like a mega hobo to me.
Can we pls appreciate the difference between Pewds and the Ace Family. Rather than shoving a camera in the face of his wife and child and shamelessly plus their merch. Pewds takes the time to educate us and reflect. He is so humble and this is why he has still stayed relevant, he has not lost his relatability or let the fame drastically change him :)
Pewds then: &quot;I&#39;ll get rid of things I don&#39;t need!&quot;<br><br>Pewds now: Where&#39;s the spatula Marzia
&quot;I think you&#39;ll it in here, where the emptiness resides&quot; <b>points at head</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>God damn, thats a fucking kick to the sternum...
ack
No i did not do my homework i learned from pewds
How could people actually not feel bad. Sure he is a millionaire but still, feeling robbed is terrible. Also the person who wrote the thing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=27">0:27</a> is horrible
I dont think that people should have made fun of  marzia cause her things got stolen<br>Well this video is 4 months ago so it doesnt really matters now
stay strong floor gang AUUGHHH!!!!
Hello
Pewdiepie, rich in wealth, and rich in knowledge.
Diagonese is a complete moron
Story of my life.....
who cares bro?
felix: gets robed<br>felix: its ok, i dont really care about the plasma tv anyway he can have it üòÅüòÑ
philosophy videos are great
&quot;I didn&#39;t lose anything, but my wife did...&quot; Uh, but... never mind.
Boi ur everything but an actor üòÇ<br>Reading straight out of a script <br>Dont get me wrong nothing wrong with it but the monotone voice feels kinda soulless and lame <br>Just my personal opinion here
All hail pewdiepie his knowledge is beyond the universe...Like this but if you need more subscribe to pewdiepie...
Why you didn&#39;t fight? YOURE VIKING!!
Damn throwing out awards? Pewds is humble that&#39;s for sure
How dare he steal from pewds
Diogenes don&#39;t have a child. I believe when you have a child, you will probably change your mindset. Especially when they reach 9 years old. ;)
Who made more off this robbery?
All I ve learned from this is that ancient Greeks were just a little bit disturbed by people masturbating on the streets and/or pissing on them.
that is sad :( i hope you well be suport it and not &quot;fan&quot; making some joke
Poor pewds
so much idiots here..
Imagine being happy when a successful person that gain success through honest mean have an unfortunate accident while using amazon services
Who wants pewdiepie as their history teacher now
Christian missionaries
I&#39;m so sad
Are you listening to Philosophize This!?
Please make more videos about philosophers and philosophy.
So Pewdiepie made the decision to get rid of his things before or after the robbery?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=25">0:25</a> Is that real?
He got robbed<br>He then earn back through the views
‚ÄúI find it funny how I lost more items reading about him than actually getting robbed‚Äù
More respect for pewds
Wow, now im really convinced his normal videos are unscripted. This was like high schooler reading book report
I know he said he got rid of all awards and his 10 mill play button has been found. But does anyone think he kept the ruby bro fist or bobby dukes 100,000,000 award
Thanks Pewds, now I can learn Greek philosophy faster with you.<br><br>btw sorry you got robbed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=132">2:12</a> is that the new ps5?
It&#39;s amazing how Pewdiepie can be this really humorous guy then change into a philosopher real fast, Truly amazing.
The people who celebrated are kind of dumb.  What if something was stolen like something that had meaning to him, like an object that their loved one gave him before he/she passed away, and oof this got dark..
Those who disliked where heartless degenerates who have no souls and love to watch the suffering of others.
I always come back to this video, anyone else?
I learned this Something new!
When he said his two most favorite things, i thought he would say edgar and maya, not his equipment lmao
.haters gonna hate <br>the bro instead lecture them by being philosophical <br>cool played bro.<br>cool
The media: it‚Äôs fine he‚Äôs rich<br><br><br>Pewdiepie: laughs in philosophy
I love this video
Robber lost pewdiepie win
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=131">2:11</a><br><b>hell yes it&#39;s a perfect example</b>
Its funny how theres a chance the robber is watching this
Do you watch Sam O&#39;Nella Academy?
this is super sad
I wish I had a dog so I could call him Diogenes.
Meowww
uhhhhmm
I wonder he added this video to which playlist? Barrel philosophy ig?
I love these videoes
Pewds get rebbed <br>Pewds again : akey i wanna be dog
Robbers: <b>steal nothing</b><br>Felix: fine I&#39;ll do it myself
I hope you guys caught the robber
Diogenes final wish wasn&#39;t for a proper burial but rather to be thrown over the gates of the city to have the rodents and animals feast on his body as a way for him to give back to the earth when he had taken from it.
<b>diogenes challenges plato</b><br>the whole room : :0
Do more like this pewds, it&#39;s really entertaining &lt;3 love you pewds
Greetings from Mexico! you are earth¬¥s ambassador if i get to choose, i just wanted to leave in your radar a dude that is water Gang , Richard Sowa. The guy made his own island. Check him out .
Came for the news<br><br><br>Stayed for the philosophy.
Pewdiepie could buy more play buttons anyway, except for the 100mil and 50 mil
PewDiePie I‚Äôm about to thanoss snap those idiots out of existence
So sad
He just salty he got robbed xD
When did felix become a history teacher?
Why would you get rid of your creator awards?!
Damn bro every night I‚Äôm scared of getting robbed and this happened to you I feel super bad
pewds:get roobbed<br>pewds:i dont want to throw away my youtube awards<br><b>accidetally throws diamond play button</b>
Don‚Äôt forget your 1k dolla mic....... the AKG c414 xii lol
More philosophy!
mans forgot about the featherless chicken
They probably knew that you were a youtuber and just doing that for attention
Now I know why pewds is floor gang
Honestly who would laugh at this ? it‚Äôs like laughing at a person dying
PewDiePie I&#39;m very sorry that you got wrong I I hope that this never happens again to you are you sure
What&#39;s the backround song? please a NEED to know please...
Wtf
Pewds: ‚ÄòThoughts on getting robbed‚Äô<br><br>What everyone heard: Facts of Diogenes
I really enjoy all these Philosophy videos(lessons). It really makes you think about things you‚Äôve never thought of before.
19 year olds learning the ways of life
I was never one to agree with diogenes cynicism since that is a poisonous mindset that can make enemies with something you control behavior two the lack of respect he have to his peers because &quot;it&#39;s a waste of time&quot; I am surprise his dead is not by murder 3 this philosophy and lifestyle if adopted will send everyone straight to the savage stone age clear negative consequences I felt everyone nowadays adopt this negative trait like it&#39;s a good trait
I am sad you got  robd
When felix takes over to pewdiepie : the face cam goes off
Why does pewds have a CRT TV.
The biggest Crime of 2020
Vote to let pewds just do philosophy <br>It seems to be what he enjoys and it was a major learning curve on what you dont seem to learn in school <br>Didnt learn anything about this in UK school <br>But I&#39;ve never been more interested when pewdiepie teaches us
floor gang might be more than just a meme
So pewds no longer has his play buttons
And Diogenes said &quot;if I wasn&#39;t diogenes I&#39;d want to be Diogenes too&quot;
(I know im very late) can you make a philosophy video based on justice revenge and truth?
47478th
I thought I was watching the discovery channel for a second
I‚Äôm sorry Marzia, hope you‚Äôre ok ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yo hablo espa√±ol xd
I woud rather watch a pewdiepie philosophy video than attending my philosophy class.
Diogenes burnt the shit out of Plato
For some reason I thought Pewds gonna make some jokes out of Diogenes. But he actually went deep about it üòÆ
Dude the people who were happy he got robbed, shit man karma ain&#39;t gone me pretty for them
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs">0:00</a> that box TV tho
The thumbnail doesn&#39;t match with the whole video

I wish the police can get the robber and the safe return of all the stuff he stole... <br><br>I always like your videos when you talk about a book or philosophy..

Pewdiepie: Gets robbed<br><br>Also Pewdiepie: <b>FiLoSoFi</b>
When u tryna make a deep video but pewds voice just cant be taken serious
Hey, rememebr that one time a swedish guy got robbed and became a philosopher and historian for a day?
I would disagree that Alexander wanted Diogenes lifestyle. Alxanders‚Äôs teacher, Aristotle(another great philosopher) declared that the ideal happiest/virtuous people were either magnanimous (like Alexander), or concerned with small honors(diogenes.) this is why Alexander must have said he would be Diogenes if not Alexander, since he would have been honorable but not rich and popular. It‚Äôs the same goal but different paths.
Papa pewds is now our history teacher
U cant imagine how thats while haunt you to know something entered your house when you was asleep, u will be another person<br>And for me.....that whas changed my vision of life <br><b>good luck</b>
I just have to said <b>sorry</b>
i dont think people understand that getting robbed takes away your sense of safety, and that isn&#39;t something money can buy...
What book was he reading about this philosopher, Diogenes?
there is so many books which one did he read?
Can someone please explain lol
I definitly understand why pewds and marzia want to move.
The things that we value actually have little value on their own
Please do more philosophical videos m
Diogenes was the first sovereign citizen who drove a car without a licence.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=230">3:50</a> i just had pewds videos on autoplay while gaming on my phone...why????

Here&#39;s how Felix transitioned into floor gang
Felix, i&#39;m no wealthy man - but I can say that the moments and events i&#39;ve experienced have changed and defined me.<br><br>God and the universe gives everybody this experience in some way. If I were robbed, I know that there&#39;d be people to help me - that&#39;s worth more than anything I own.
Idk what this is, but I like
The fact that the majority of his videos are funny, I like this side of Pewds also.
This legit helped me in my philosophy class
Is this going to turn into a history class?
Felix living in a barrel? His worse enemy? If that happens, If I wasn&#39;t James, I wish to be Felix.

BEHOLD A MAN
Alexander The Great: Are u the guy shitting on my streets?<br>Diogenes:
There was like 1 part of this video that wasn‚Äôt just a rehash of Sam O‚Äônella‚Äôs video on Diogenes, but whatever. It‚Äôs just funny how he made 2 videos on philosophy and suddenly everyone thinks he‚Äôs an intellectual philosopher
Just stay safe, not because Corona because your life is value for selfish people like me who hopes for your remain as an good just because the fact that you had had cheered many days of my and continues to do so.
And this people is why we should be so proud he&#39;s the most famous youtuber
Say man who sell merch.
Ok pewds did you keep the 100mil award I just wanna know because it is interesting
What&#39;s the name of the book he read?

Cool story bro so much humble
So does anyone else want Pewds to do these more is it just me?
how much do you want to bet a history teacher will use this  to teach their students
Make more of these amazing videos
Would love more like this!
who else is using this for a school presentacion???
Diogenes: FLOOR GANG!
Make this a series! Pewdsolophy!
I LOVE THIS KIND OF VIDEOS
Literally people are encouraging robbers by celebrating this, but they don‚Äôt even realize that.
Who in tf would through out the awards
What exactly did you do with the awards? I know about the 100mil case and the 10mil play button, but did you keep 50mil and 100mil?Did you throw away the 100k,1mil+
imagine living in a barrel and instead of Alexander the Great coming, some Swedish guy came and started screaming at the barrel
So this is why he&#39;s sitting on the floor? Minimalism?
Diogenes was floor gang
Why does this sound like the homily
Why does tgis sound like the homily
Thank you, Felix, I have homework about Diogenes
Please make more videos like this!
can u plz make a book review and include some of diogenes?
Nice<br>Next time wait for them to be home and sequestrate them against ransom
If he got rid of his awards, does that mean also his 100 million and ruby play button?
Pewdiepie is a simp
Came after the video &quot;do all millonaries think the same?&quot;

I learned this a few years ago, but mostly because of my personality, I always try to see the brightside, like I don&#39;t the best PC, car, phone, just the essential, don&#39;t need new clothes just for being new, and money was never a problem thanks God.
Diogenes is an insightful homeless dude
Did pewds really throw away his 100mil and all other awards?
Apparently he threw his play buttons away :(
pewdiepie  this is karma you deserve it
you thought it was Diogenes but it was i, Dio!
Who&#39;s here from that guy who found Felix&#39;s diamond play-button?
I don‚Äôt think anyone realizes how iconic this video is üò©
Also guys Pewds Diamond play button got Disposed
Why can‚Äôt anyone shit themselves during math class:(
Felix please do more videos like this I love you Felix &lt;3
I wonder if he threw his 100mil award, I know he threw his 10 mil one but I felt like a big part of the 100 mil one and I hope he didn‚Äôt. Although he can do what he wants
Are the awards of Felix gone ?
Why did you get rid of all your old play buttons üòüüòüüòü

This guy is smart, why does he choose to make no meaning video&#39;s for peoples entertainment?
This explain floor gang perfectly
If this a joke or he has lost his mind....? ü§î
I cried...
This is why you need to live in a country that has guns.
This is a really interesting video.
Highly recommend ‚ÄòMinimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things‚Äô on Netflix !!
love these videos
&quot;He will be fine. He reads philosophy.&quot;
For anyone wondering, he did throw out his diamond play button a channel called the the retro future 2 bought it for ¬£400 and has asked felix if he wants it back! Go check it out!
that was beautiful and eye opening
This is unespectedly intertaining. Big ups
If I was there I would kick his balls me:9 years old chief
This video title should be How To Owned Your Haters In A Very Wise Way
yoo pewds some dude has your diamond play button
I was expecting to hear your thoughts, Not a History Lesson.
If I was the one who robbed Pewdiepie, I would‚Äôve stolen some of his limited merch
Diogenes is one of my inspiration now; sir I hope you help me to grow as well thanks

and then he lives in a barrel now, a diamond barrel but still a barrel
Alexander: ah, this must be the famous philosopher I‚Äôve heard so much about, I‚Äôll offer him something special<br>Diogenes: fuck off, you‚Äôre blocking the sun<br>Alexander: man, he‚Äôs so cool
most people who believe just because you are rich that it does not matter how much you lose have probably already lost themselves, considering money can never buy happiness as material items will never give happiness to a person just look at animals they literally live around nature and carry nothing but their food and themselves and yet are happy enough.
<b>YOYO AND PHILOSOPY</b>
I really hope we can find the thief that stole his stuff, we would destroy him as an army
I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about Pewds throwing out his sub milestones, he even threw out his Diamond Play Button.

I used this video for my school project on Diogenes, you probably won‚Äôt be reading this but ty Pewds this helped a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è
I wish pewds would continue philosophy
WHAT!
What does the last line mean?
You take enlightenment from a guy who craps in the streets and behaves like a dog .. While the greatest man who ever lived, Prophet Muhammed (pbuh), a man who abolished slavery, racism, established womens rights, the greatest conqueror who ever lived, and the most chartible, kind, and influential personality is overlooked.. A man who taught us how to shower and clean ourselves, and the guy who craps in the street takes precedence.. This to me is a big disappointment
I keep coming back to this. I hope we get more of these
I know this video is a month ago but this video inspired me to keep bettering myself. Thank you pewds for putting my on to Diogenes, I now will always strive to become a better person and maybe one day have my own story
does anyone know what book this is that pewds is talking about?
I love these kind of videos, thank you pewds &lt;3
Did anyone find the book he read?
Pewds: Gets robbed<br>Me: this is gonna be interesting<br>Pewds: teaches history <br>Me: umm... Epic!
Anyone else here because of the retro future?
I had a R.E. lesson on Aristotle, Plato and Philosophy<br>I had recently watched Pewd&#39;s Aristotle, Plato and Diogenes videos, so I was<br>&quot;I&#39;m something of a philosopher my self&quot;
More content like this Pewds. I really love your philosophical side.
Fun fact: Elliot from the channel The Retro Future bought PewDiePie‚Äôs diamond play button on eBay.
Eyy pewds, The Channel  &quot;The Retro Future&quot; bought youre legit Diamond Playbutton on ebay, from someone who got it out of youre binbag in front of youre house. You should check it out man.
Damn
sorry that happened pewds
Ok
So we have to shit on Street...
You inspired me to make my philosophy project on Diogenes, thanks!
Anyone wants to burn the robber mother house down?
Hearing Felix talk so seriously is kind of unnerving...
People that celebrated that misfortune of Pewds and Marzia are people that should never go rich. Especially the ones that thought it was fine for them to be robbed because they have lots of money
Stfu
I have no idea what this film is about
I feel extremely proud being Greek right now.
This shit introduced me to stoicism.<br>Thanks poods.
my favorite video so far
Diogenes...dog like...Furry???   0_0
So what did he do with his awards? They&#39;re of no use to anyone else, except maybe a museum or art gallery.
He sold his play buttons
You have a wife ?? SIMP
bring back literature club..... i beg you
I am A big fanüòä
with this video felix made more money then the robber took..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=355">5:55</a> We all know why.
Please do more videos like this one. They are really interesting and I consider you to be a good rolemodel for the kids watching ytube videos, although they might be underrepresented in your audience ;)
People lose their mind when they have money.
You are a very amazing, intelligent, and kind person. I love to how you took this normally awful incident into a new light
Aristotle: man is just a featherless biped.    Diogenes: <b>stares hard at featherless chicken</b>

He should have kept the awards though they have functional use like photos and memes!
this is a big brain video. i like it.
Jesus Christ saves.
Sees a non 10 min pewdiepie video<br>Alright its time to get serious
Pewds should come up with a &quot;Philosophy Friday&quot; type of series. Btw I&#39;m using this video as an idea for my PPT presentation at College.
You&#39;re right... we need more public masturbation.
thank you i‚Äôve used this for my history assignment
Diogenes... THE„ÄÄORIGINAL„ÄÄMADLAD
Maybe wuhan rob the house thats why they got corona
üò≠ that‚Äôs a lot of wisdom bro
Why am I learning more from here than school
my favorite story is the one where plato says that a man is just a &quot;featherless bipod&quot; and so diogenes plucks a chicken and takes it to plato and declares &quot;behold a man!&quot;
I hope he donated his awards, or sold them and gave the money to a charity. I don‚Äôt mean this in a negative way, I hope it just didn‚Äôt go to waste.
These are my favorite types of videos, I‚Äôm sad Felix doesn‚Äôt make more because I find it really interesting alongside the fact that I can tell Felix does too.
Is this a history lesson?<br>But fr that guy probably robbed you because he didn&#39;t know the concept on the economy  and doesn&#39;t know how to buy things
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=37">0:37</a> Is that a gurren laggan wallpaper?
Your house have been robbed, is 90% empty. But your soul is full.
I wonder what book he was reading
Diogenes was completely self serving. While avoiding materialistic pursuits is meritorious, ultimately he lived by contributing nothing to anyone but himself and his own pleasure, which is, in essence, materialistic.
PewDiePie is the Diogenes of the modern era &lt;&lt;&lt; after the robbery...
become an ancient history teacher
Pewd‚Äôs rather not your real name is Kjellberg Felix

Pewds:gets robbed <br>Hater:he will be fine he has 1,000,000$<br>Me:attacking hater
Pewgaypie if you find this comment you are indian legend.
I hope this doesn‚Äôt inspire him to quit YouTube.
This sad that he got robbed.
Diogenes was legit the greatest hobo to have ever lived
I doubt that Diogenes was happy.
Diogonese&#39;s death was a big meme ngl
Pewdiepie: I learned a lot from Diogenes about all the useless stuff I have. So I sold, donated or thrown it away<br>Marzia: Where the FRICK is all my STUFF???
I love these kind of videos
Used info from this video for a school project, thanks pewds
I HATE HISTORY
did you know that getting over it was based on diogi(whatever) the man in the cauldron or barrel is depicted and referenced to throughout the game.
Whoever celebrated Pewds getting robbed deserves to get robbed aswell. See how it feels. Disgusting. Pathetic inbred haters.
I mean realistically Felix I think the issue is the people who have meanly commented on the fact you were robbed don&#39;t give a shit enough to explain their thoughts. It&#39;s awful being robbed. Your home feels weird because someone was there without your consent and it feels oddly tainted and unsafe. Regardless of the things taken. HOWEVER if someone broke into my home and took my things it would be virtually impossible to replace. I think the point is these people maybe haven&#39;t been robbed before or again don&#39;t care and are just being thoughtlessly mean.
Ha i guess Diogenes and I have something in common, we both cum on random people for no reason.
Could we please have philosophy reviews instead of meme reviews?
Ecclesiastes in a nutshell...
soooo deeeep [screaming 11yo emo]
I thought that Diogenes threw away his bowl because he saw a boy eating soup out of bread and then eating the bread
i cant believe im using this for my assignment <br>thanks pewds
History lessons with PewDiePie
Wow this six minutes were such a fucking waste of time
Soz to hear ppl are making jokes
Was it his house in the UK or Japan?
So you did Konmari?
Well now i know about Alexander and Diogenes.
It&#39;s a bit cheesy
I wish this can be a series lowkey
Hearing a video like this was so like idk,opening mind wise ...idk it&#39;s weird to explain but thank you so much pewdiepie using stories like these to connect to life
At the beginning of him talking about Diogenes, I felt like ‚ÄúWow this guy is really kind and selfless and has a deep connection with, life and stuff.‚Äù<br><br>By the end I thought, ‚ÄúActually he was just a mad lad who didn‚Äôt give a crap what anyone thought about him.‚Äù
It&#39;s ok to rob rich people? It&#39;s not ok to rob ANYONE. It is not ok to HURT anyone in ANYWAY. Grow up people.
I Fucking love you
This is why stupid people can&#39;t understand the memes. So Pewds taught his army.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMpgsD5o8bs&amp;t=363">6:03</a> that burn was brutal lmao
I feel like l learn more with pewds than my actual teachers. He should really do a series, it&#39;s interesting, calming and educational. I love these videos!
You are my new favorite you tube star
Pewdiepie getting robbed doesn‚Äôt mean that he can buy everything back. Sure he can but, you can‚Äôt buy back your sentimental values.
‚ÄúHe would often sh*t himself‚Äù hehe
i will give you a challenge try to learn and speak the greek language
Now this is high quality content. For real.
what book did you read
All the dislikes are the robbers botted accounts
I was going through Reddit and enjoying my brisk evening walk when a bike came from behind and snatched my phone. I tried chasing but never got my phone back.<br>I feel you bruh.
GOOD THATS HAPPY FLAMINGO IS BETTER THEN YOU AND YOUR LIFE

This should be a series

Any book recommendations on Diogenes?
Please keep making philosophical videos
0 stars<br>Wouldn&#39;t do again
Is the richest man on youtube really giving us a lecture about materialism?
This is the first video in which I&#39;ve been able to properly discern Felix&#39;s accent when speaking English
Much love Pewds. I know this can be hard to have your privacy broken. It doesn&#39;t matter what wealth you have, it always sucks. I hope this never happens to you again. Btw brilliant video.
We were learning about minimalism in school and I got my teacher to play this in class
Im nervous about him saying &quot;i  got rid of awards&quot;. Does that mean he got rid of the 100 mill award bobby duke made for him?
@monexmms
I need this as a series, forever!üíØ

I wish this video existed when I was doing my philosophy class
Getting broken into booooüëé<br>Emotional attachment is priceless
&quot;The emptiness resides here&quot; is the catalyst that began the process of crippling others as a means of insults..<br><br><br><br><br>Nah jk I&#39;m just using big words, but I started laughing so much when he said that
Such a big dick response
the pewdiepie army going from age 12 to age 70
Deep
I wish I could be like that, I guess I&#39;m too materialistic in the sense that I wouldn&#39;t be able to get rid of the things I was able to earn
Wow instead you literally send this guy to hell on the media you just take thing philosophically.<br>(Sorry you got robbed i‚Äôd punch that asshole in the face if I could)
What is the
The most interesting video I&#39;ve seen on youtube  since 2018 lol
Imagine thinking him getting robbed is good. Wow.
Love these thought-invoking videos
Iloveyouangelotolentino
Seeing pewds talk about this things, i think pewds is a smart person, i mean there&#39;s no information about how smart pewds is ü§£
pls make this an weekly thing, philosophy with felix :D
I have a doubt <br>If he didn&#39;t care about any laws or any restrictions or society,<br>If he lived like a street dog, living with nature,<br>a dog will normally try to get a mate. a street dog will have sexual contact with any opposite sex  dog without any hesitation.<br>Well what prevented him from having sex with a regular woman? what prevented him from unwanted intercourse or even raping?

People who thinks that getting robbed is cool or fine are either idiots or heartless
STOPPPPPOPO JUST STOPPPPP IM THE ROBBER STOP ITTTTT
I&#39;d honestly would be interested if pewdz did a whole series about philosophy and what he thinks of each lesson.
I happened to be watching women&#39;s soccer, but I think soccer is a foot sport. For a long time, Japanese people have been focusing on hand sports. The most active sport in Japan is baseball. Is it better to take the past tense? Baseball is a typical sport played by hand. So, I think soccer hasn&#39;t grown so much in Japan. I don&#39;t think it was popular either. Most of the sports played by children were baseball. Most cartoons and sports broadcasts on television were baseball. Most of the children&#39;s heroes were also baseball players. The good thing about baseball is that you can fight full for about three consecutive days. It&#39;s a sport that doesn&#39;t run very much. However, soccer is a sport that must be run all the time. So, if you work hard for one day, you can&#39;t play as hard as you can without resting for about two days. And the highlight of soccer is the scene where goals are decided. But the moment when that goal is determined is an instant. The goal is determined in an instant, so if you can&#39;t see that moment, what else is the other two or three hours? Maybe that moment will not come. If it ends with 0: 0, there is no scene there. In the case of baseball, attacking and defending change, so you can do a little errand or go to the toilet in the meantime, so you can never miss an important scene. But recently in Japan, I like football more and more. That&#39;s the development of video. You can see replays. The time has come when anyone can easily transfer and watch videos. If you take your smartphone, you can enjoy it in the toilet and in the vehicle. And everyone can enjoy it anywhere for a long time. Thanks to this, various sports have become popular in Japan. The era of baseball is over. Older baseball fans may not be enough, but a variety of sports is about increasing the potential of many people. So that&#39;s better. Thank you very much. God.
Ummm... How can dogs be above society of humans? Dogs don&#39;t think about past?
Why the edit :(
Why you giving history class
there&#39;s a hero in Dota 2 that literally is a walking robber! his name is Bounty Hunter! so why don&#39;t you play him yourself ?
Poor marziaüò£....the stuff she had been collecting for years got robbed...hang in the pewds ....love how strongly you are handling this...god bless‚ù§Ô∏è
I want some more history lessons from you. Your voice and the way you speak, the slight amount of humor while also being serious, comparing the lesson to yourself and becoming better from it are all amazing things that you have done in this short yet incredible video. I truly wish for mor of this.
More of these types of vids please
Wow! If that isn&#39;t food for thought I don&#39;t know what is. Been wanting to declutter my life as I have so much useless junk, this was very enlightening.
What an inspiring video! Great research Felix and I‚Äôm sorry that you got robbed:/
Pewds, it&#39;s time to make a &#39;Can this video get the same amount of likes, dislikes and comments?&#39;
This is deep
History lesson with Pewds! <br><br>Sorry though for  the break in :(
Rubius es mejor que t√∫!!
Awesome!! Evoked your good old book reviews, pleased to hear your intellectual journey is progressing well
&quot;if I weren&#39;t me. I&#39;d be me too&quot; -Diogenes
I like how ppl are like Haha he got robbed despite even rich people can still be sad about it likee Jeffrey star got robbed and hes rich like??
I don‚Äôt understand 95% but still look - google translate
Wow, that was really insightful and intersting. We just learned alot about how you think, Felix. Cool videoüëè‚ù§Ô∏è
Having to pause, read the text, unpause, try to listen to what you&#39;re saying, pause again next second to read the next image just gave me a big headache. Otherwise good content but i&#39;m not doing this again.
My mom thought i was listening to a documentary
I really wish Felix wouldn&#39;t take the stories of Diogenes meeting all the famous people at the time at such face value.<br><br>While we can still talk about the lessons in those stories, most of them are probably bullshit.
I love PewDiePie, but man these are very &quot;iam14andthisisdeep&quot;<br><br>Not that he can&#39;t cover these subjects, but he just has a surface level understanding of some topics most people don&#39;t know much about so know he&#39;s acting like he has knowledge.
Pewdiepie history lessons!
This is like Kardashians talking about how money means nothing.. easy to say when you have it
dude diogenes was so savage
you can&#39;t actually die from holding your breath though... you&#39;d just pass out and breathe
Pewds making sure our brains stay BIG!
Basically saying that, like Diogenes, he doesn&#39;t give any fucks
To me what diogenes doing is to live without attachements. Before he threw away the bowl he attaches himself to it because he believes that he needed it to drink water but after seeing the boy drinking with his hand he realise that the bowl has become somewhat of a requirement for him to be able to drink or a burden if you will. <br>     <br>In  our modern life we attache ourself to objects because we think we need them but not realise they are somewhat a burden. Like a car you think you needed it to go to work but when you   have to get it serviced or worse it broke down it is a burden.<br><br>What we  can gather from diogenes is not to live without possesion but rather not be attach to it.
Jeez I didnt know this actually happened. Hope everything can get figured out
Pewdiepie: gets robbed<br>Pewdiepie: YEARN
i mean, i&#39;ll be glad to recieve any unwanted items from you pewds :)

Thank You Pewdiepie, now I know what to write for my book report

Instead of overthinking minor setback just move forward
I am so sorry felix life is rough but every once in a while you have to say fuck you to life and just move on
Pewdiepie: Thoughts on getting robbed<br>Video: DiOgEnEs
What&#39;s with the voice
<b>BIG BRAIN TIIIIIME</b>
Hypocrite
that last line though üíØ
We can agree that most of these type of fans are toxic
i got robbed on christmas day. I wish I could look at it the way you do but i cant.
I thought it was satire until he started his history lesson on diogynes
Dammn we need more of this what ever this is
Pewdie is literally Alexander the Great! Dude, ease it with the hubris, a better comparison would probably be with Icarus.
Don‚Äôt worry Pewds, you will get by. Like an itch in your hand, you just gotta bite it
I really love when felix makes a short video on philosophy. I&#39;m honestly so excited everytime he brings the subject up.
Lunch Club be like üò≥
Wow, that is a whole other level of self actualization. Pewds becomes one, living with a barrel, his former arch Nemesis. I love it.
Wealth still gives you freedom, a sense of relief (you don&#39;t have to work anymore) and a lot of comfort. It also makes it easier to get what you want in life. So the experience is not as little as you make it out to be.
Philosophy is just a man. A blind man... in a dark room trying to find a black cat that isn‚Äôt there.
Theft is NEVER ok. This guy got inside his house. His property. Property is a very important thing. Its your home, where you feel safe. How can he feel safe now that he knows people can break into his house? This is why we should all have firearms especially inside our home.
Bruh I can‚Äôt get over the fact that pewds just read me a group project on philosophy and I just sat here and watched I‚Äôm not even mad you‚Äôre reading from a script I‚Äôm just mad I stayed for all of it
Bruh I can‚Äôt get over the fact that pewds just read me a group project on philosophy and I just sat here and watched I‚Äôm not even mad you‚Äôre reading from a script I‚Äôm just mad I stayed for all of it
Honestly these videos makes me wanna read up on philosophy
The cup&#39;s not empty, just filled with air.
Damn...<br>This was deep. I&#39;d be glad to see more videos like this
what is this cringe mess
Don&#39;t feel bad for him cus he&#39;s rich? So don&#39;t feel bad for a poor person neither cus didn&#39;t have much to steal in the first place so won&#39;t lose much. Wtf is wrong with people? Anyone getting robbed is a shitty event. Don&#39;t be so shitty about it if it happened to you would you care? Obviously ffs.

If this video isn‚Äôt used in schools I swear to Diogenes

Tbh, Diogenes just seems like a loser who came up with excuses to act like a homeless jerk.
I absolutely love those kinds of videos pewds, please moooree
Me, a philosophy student, every time Felix talks about philosophy: <b>recollects the Platonic Form of the smile</b>
Thank you for sharing, Diogenes is one of the most interesting figures of his time.
As a philosophy, nerd these videos make me very happy. You should consider branching out from Greek philosophy, there&#39;s great works of philosophy from all over the world. :)
This not PewDiePie video...unsubbedüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I want more philosophy with pewdiepie
Getting robbed inst just about material possessions but also peace of mind being messed up. I&#39;m glad you guys weren&#39;t hurt. People who say they don&#39;t feel bad because the victim may have money are just petty as hell.
Diogenes was a Chad. Plato once defined man as &quot;featherless bipeds.&quot; What did Diogenes do? He walked into Plato&#39;s Academy holding a plucked chicken and said, &quot;Behold, a man!&quot; Plato then added &quot;with broad flat nails&quot; to what defined man.

‚ÄúJust a minor inconvenience ‚ÄúüíÄ
I&#39;LL NEVER FORGIVE THE JAPANESE!
Love these kind of videos
fucking barrels are coming for you again pewds.
Too many red pills. i was about to slip. very nice video.
that was soo DEEP.
You can steal a copper from a beggar and you can steal a copper from a billionaire and the damage to the beggar will be greater but it is nothing compared to the damage you do to yourself.

Hey can someone tell me the other video namd when he spoke like this
i love this kind of videos especially when it&#39;s a subject in  what you&#39;re intersted. i like philosophy and you make me think about some dstuff that i would never think about myself. sorry if i made some mistakes i have a really bad english but i wanted to share my opinion anyway
PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then
Probably one of my fave vids on the channel <br>Third time watching this. <br>I find it very interesting and grounding. <br>Would love more vids like this. <br>(Your hair looks great... and nice scar üòé üëçüèº)
DIOGENES saw a boy drinking with his hands and throws away the gold cup he could have given to the boy to help him drink...

Goddamn another awesome philosophy video. These videos are just so good, keep making them. And I see that you&#39;ve come to peace with your archenemy, the barrels! Soon you&#39;ll be living in a barrel too, I just know it
Hello, I‚Äôve just uploaded a video of a gold coin that I found in my house when I was trying to catch mouse in my kitchen! Can you take a look and see if you can identify the coin for me please?
Hove is not like before.. so many break ins recently. It&#39;s sad that people celebrate and give attention to thieves...
God is watching you rob, steal or take. PewDiePie is right for the history.
üò¢
I really enjoyed learning about Diogenes and how you have applied his teaching to your own life. You explained everything so well and it actually inspired me to start letting go of more stuff that is not needed. I would totally listen if you started a podcast. You have a great mind.
all jokes aside, I actually very much appreciate Felix&#39;s strive for knowledge and deeper understanding. I find him to be someone very joyful to listen to and learn from and I think that&#39;s why people are easily drawn to his channel.  I hold pewds-sensei in very high esteem. that&#39;s it, I&#39;ve said my share
My dad&#39;s carburator was stolen in 1982.

Sub to pewdiepie brofist forever!!
Pewdiepie: Returns home and <b>finds his wife</b> with another man.<br><br><br>Also Pewds: &quot;This reminded me a story by Marquis de Sade. What a great philosopher he was, let me tell you about his life...&quot;
Why don‚Äôt you live in a gated community ü§î
Rich or Poor you guys have small PP&#39;s literal 9 year olds, pay respect degenerates!
I&#39;m waiting for second theft to happen so I can hear some good fucking philosophies
I am very happy that i found an influencer that i can laugh at and realate to but also learn something from.
I forgot that I&#39;m watching PewDiePie
Bro, you need to write a book; it could be about your life, YouTube, and your philosophy for life blended all into one, I‚Äôd buy it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Not to mention readers tend to be the best authors.
Please made dreadout2 video
I think you went too far into this
That epic gamer moment when 1% can feed the 99%.
It seems I never agree with Pewds on philosophy, anyway it&#39;s cool from pewds to to this kind of videos and share his point of view.
Anything can happen to you what ever status you have in life....I hope y‚Äôall God Bless and be safe
thats not epic<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>at all
I wish we get more philosophy stuff.
Nailed it
This is why Pewds is a succsesful persan...He is very smart yet he expresses it on goofy things...When he recieves a problem in life,he does not get mad or rage on peaple...Insted&quot; he takes it as a lesson&quot;...
My name&#39;s diogenes!!!
PEWDS I LOVE THESE KINDS OF VIDEOS, MAKE MORE LIKE THIS
I wonder what kind of stuff  they took from marzia...
Felix&#39;s philosophical videos are so interesting, do you guys have any good other channels that are about philosophy? Thanks!
This was really gay.
My rooster got kidnapped a week ago. im sad
Ight imma hire a robber to rob the robber
$$$
I sorry about that
I actually got a proper history lesson props to pewds and hope the robber and rude people have something happen to them in return
I love videos where you talk about stuff like this and the book recommendations! So glad you‚Äôre both safe
I learned something without going braindead
I saw this on a bag <br>Theifs are losers
Pewds got robbed<br>I didn&#39;t hear about this! Am I living under a f#@ing rock
...
Sounded like a school project
Why are the kids sitting in class learning about &quot;English&quot; when the teacher isn&#39;t even a book
good vid, much lov
how ironic lol i‚Äôm taking a philosophy class and this just helped me understand Diogenes‚Äô theory of philosophy.
Pewdosophy
If bourglar is watching this, thank you you are best
Yo pewds your video today helped me pass an ethics mock exam for the day after so if you see this thanks a ton it really helped with my conclusion paragraph which is meant to have some of the most marks I&#39;m elated and I hope you do more of these philosophical videos.
üëèüèΩ

Next break felix takes he&#39;s gonna be living in a barrel and crapping in the street... he&#39;s going to vacation in San Francisco!
Ive been studying philosophy for years , but this one i never heard of it üëè
People suck!!!! Just be nice! Especially to someone who is caring
felix gets robbed:<br>felix after: ahh yes this is big brain time
Good thing you were just robbed if that thief shoot you I&#39;m gonna destroy my phone and laptap
Sam o‚Äônella described him better...
Pewdiepie has been watching too much Sam o‚Äônella
Wow that&#39;s so inspirational Pewds! I am Greek and I never even knew who Diogenes was! My own school didn&#39;t even teach me things like that because it seems like they consider math equations more important, from who our ancestors where... I am so thankfull for what I have now and I&#39;m lucky to live in a society that a youtuber like you exists!
That Diogenes roast was brutal, holy smokes
I loved this philosophy lesson. Please do more videos like this! If this is the route you&#39;re wanting to go down in the future, you get big pee pee.
???
Robber very small pp üë∫üëé
Thanks for passing me in world history!
Hahaha<br>Diogenes sounds so cool by pewds introduction for him.<br>Now listen how sam o&#39;nella introduces him
I feel sorry for u guys f the robber
DIOGENES THE CYNIC NO FUCKIN WAY
can someone tell me what kind of video is this?
If you like philosophy, go listen to &quot;philosophy this&quot; podcast
At first I was quite taken aback by this video, but the more I thought, the more I realized I was rather having these negative thoughts about the change not because of any personal problems or even criticisms of it, but rather a concern with how the people and fans would think.<br>So I accounted for that and compensated in thinking, that genuinely, This is how and what pewds thought as a response would be, perhaps it would be worse to do a normal video, so he put what he truly and genuinely thought would best put you into the mindset of his situation.<br><br>If it weren&#39;t for the term &quot;philosopher&quot; being quite saturated with not many people, Pewds would definitely be a philosopher the same was Diogenes was regarded as one.<br>For all He has shown in his channel as a person.
Dont worry Pewds, The 9 Year Olds got your back
I just can‚Äôt believe people are glad when someone more fortunate than them gets robbed. It‚Äôs terrible when anyone gets robbed, regardless of whether you like them or not, what their skin pigment is, hell, even their accent! The best thing to do is be sympathetic towards the victim, in this case, Felix and not take the piss.
Sherlock time
Love this video
This is the first video of pew die pie that i like, really
I want a list of books he read about greek philosophy
shits in public, if insulted he urinanes on them<br><br><br><br><b>Deogines uses...piss?</b> <br>them seeing its a source of beverage : üòÆ
Pewds- the big brain philosopher
Normal people when robbed: Call the police
Pewds really has alot of potential, i wish he&#39;d make more philosophy based videos, or just discussing random stuff, it feels beneath him to make kids jokes in his videos, but if he enjoys what he&#39;s doing then i wish him the best
Diogenes syndrome or senile squalor syndrome has been described in the psychiatric literature with an associated mental illness in between one half and two thirds of the cases cited. The occurrence of the syndrome in the absence of a psychiatric disorder has received much attention with many hypotheses proposed. We present the case of a 72-year-old man living for many years in domestic squalor whose presentation, neuropsychological profile and history suggest an underlying autistic spectrum disorder. We are not aware of any similar case in an older adult reported in the medical literature. The co-occurrence of these two conditions is an intriguing one as certain key features of autistic spectrum disorder may predispose to Diogenes syndrome.
Thanks for the Ted talk poodsü•∫üñ§
Let&#39;s be honest we all heard about Diogenes first from Getting Over It
Girls: billie eyelash is so deep<br>Me an intelectual:
This was a really interesting video but apart from that, I‚Äôm truly sorry for Marzia and I hope that it shocked her more than it hurt her. This was a really nice reflection on what your career has given you. For once a youtuber doesn‚Äôt shove cars and huge luxurious homes in your face and a ctually makes you think. Thank you for this video.
My cars give me great satisfaction and pleasure. But they also frustrate me when I&#39;m trying to work on them and the 10mm wrenches and sockets disappear. But they&#39;re worth it. I don&#39;t think of them as just possessions though, as they are more of an extension of myself. Especially the track car. Of all the crap I own, these are the things I would refuse to give up, everything else though, I&#39;d give up if I had to, they&#39;re garbage (fuck that multi-thousand dollar computer I took the time to build and the VR equipment, the sim racing rig, the thousands of dollars worth of airsoft junk, and whatever else I have wasted money on).
It&#39;s just wealth redistribution you and the rest of the 1% all have it coming.  Feel the Bern!
PewDiePie didn&#39;t get robbed. Marzia got robbed. And they celebrated it.
Diogenes is the most non-hedonestic hedonists.
I&#39;m so sorry Pewds :(
I can&#39;t stop thinking of the getting over it scene where he goes mad in that barrel. <br>Please live in a barrel like him.<br>Just for a week or something.<br>Don&#39;t let your memes be dreams
Felix real talk, whats the name of the book? ‚ù§
ok but i love pewds philosopher videos, they are so interesting and make me want to read up on it
<b>The robber saw this video</b><br>&quot;I think I accidentally took these&quot;
Thank you
fuck is this supposed to be?
Plato: &quot;Man is a featherless biped&quot;<br>Diogenes: <b>plucks chicken, holds up</b> &quot;Behold, a man!&quot;
And this is why Felix hates BARRELS!!!
That was interesting...time to find a long stick to scratch an itchy part of my body I can&#39;t reach.
ok boomer
What fuking
My name is alexander
Alright class turn your pages to page 69

Propeta Pewdiepie
Yuh more pewedie philosophyyy
You should talk about these things more.
I actually hadn&#39;t heard about the break, or the fact people were cheering and celebrating it. Do people not know what a sentimental item is? Even if someone with millions of dollars was robbed I would feel sad and give them my sympathy as some items can&#39;t be replaced. And the feeling of safety in your own house being taken from you like that? Devastating.
I really enjoy these video essays you have added to your collection.
music in the backround?
So can I say that YouTube subscribers limit is at least 103Million. Just like Facebook has a friends list limit of 5000 but the block list is endless and Twitter is also endless. Same with Instagram, Flickr, Pinterest, Vimeo &amp; loads more social sites. Which Pewdiepie has 103Million subscribers.<br><br>Social networking platforms is the way of life for everyone (including trolls)....
Why would you celebrate even if they could replace it it might have sentimental value it&#39;s still terrible like your not being funny your just a bad person
I‚Äôm proud to be Greek
Everyone in the comments isn‚Äôt even focusing on what Pewdiepie said.
Not what I expected but this was a really good video
This video is proof Pewds is intelligent
Who else got an itch when he mentioned it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
King Felix! All hail the king felix!
That was such a good video I love it when he goes philosophical.
&quot;A large urine&quot;
When he used to hate barrels now likes a philosopher living inside one
So... u get rid of your stuff for this?, That&#39;s pethetic to be honest
What a way to respond to haters lmao look at my boiii Pewds with the big brains lol
He just watched Sam O`Nellas video lol
Am I in a History class?
Instructions unclear I now have kitchen of smashed bowls ;(
PEWDS you traitor I thought barrels were you enemy!!
Please never stop doing those videos
I love poodiepie storytime
I respect these videos a lot.
I gotta admit... this video shows more about you, and your way of thinking, even though, it turned into meme material, its genious, what a bummer that you guys got robbed, I think is unfortunate, specially to your wife.  And at the same time, what a learning experience came from it.  Stay safe.
so fucking good. I missed this content‚ô•Ô∏è
Hello
