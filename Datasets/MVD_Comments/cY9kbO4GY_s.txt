The facts that guns are legal in all 50 states but I can’t have an OTF in a few, I can’t have a butterfly knife in a few, and I can’t have nunchucks in a few… speaks to how stupid the USA laws are. Nunchucks are too dangerous I guess but shoot away kid 🤠

Proverbs 11: 4. Riches profit nothing in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.<br>12: 4. A virtuous woman is the crown of her husband, but she who shames him is like rottenness in her bones.<br>14: 1 EVERY wise woman builds her house; but the foolish one overthrows it with her bare hands.<br>14: 12. There is a way that seems right to man, but the end of it is the ways of death.<br>14: 27. The fear of the LORD is a source of life, to turn away from the snares of death. Read the Bible! One day we will all be judged by God for everything that is written in it.
