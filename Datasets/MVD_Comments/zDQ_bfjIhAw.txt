Dwayne Johnson death hoax: No, The Rock didn’t die after failed stunt<br>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has become the target of a viral death hoax. The 47-year-old actor is not dead; however, thousands of unsuspecting fans shared the fake news on their social media timeline.<br><br>A hoax news story that has been circulating on Facebook claiming the actor and WWE star died after a failed stunt with the following headline: “BBC: Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Dies at 47 after a terrible stunt attempted failed.”<br><br>The hoax used the BBC News (British Broadcasting Corporation) label to appear as a legitimate news organization. However, the link circulating on Facebook directs users to a hoax website.<br><br>A search on the BBC News website for the terms “Dwayne Johnson dead” or “Dwayne Johnson death” does not garner any results similar to the link being shared on social media.<br>Dwayne Johnson is one of the most influential entertainers with 14 million Twitter followers and over 160 million Instagram followers.<br>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has not responded to the death hoax and is focusing on one of his many projects. The ‘Hobbs and Shaw’ actor updated his Instagram account with a photo of his upcoming Under Armour campaign.<br>This isn’t the first time the internet has declared Johnson dead. The actor debunked a death hoax in 2011 on Facebook. In 2014, a similar hoax claimed the actor died while shooting a stunt for Fast and Furious 7.<br><br>Dwayne Johnson recently appeared at UFC 244: Masvidal vs. Diaz where he presented the winner of the main event Jorge Masvidal with the BMF belt.<br><br>The actor recently wrapped up filming Jumanji: The Next Level and is producing an MMA film about mixed martial arts fighter Mark “The Smashing Machine’ Kerr.<br>The Rock is alive and well, the actor has not immediately responded to a  request for comment on this report.
Man! I was hoping this was true
when i first saw this, i did not think it was true. but there is more and more videos about it. RIP To Dwayne Johnson..
People have nothing  better to say. So those are true jerks!!!
Dwayne Johnson Death Hoax Dismissed Since Actor Is ‘Alive And Well’<br><br>On Monday (August 28) the actor&#39;s reps officially confirmed that Dwayne Johnson is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He&#39;s still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.<br><br>Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved actor. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe.

The real Rock is Dead. He started spouting off in the ring in 1999 about human genetic cloning. Look it up. They didn&#39;t like that, so they cloned him. Clones are very obedient and have to be regrown every 5 years. They are grown as full grown seen how the skin would not last starting from a baby. The skin would deteriorate.
The man is not dead.......................???????????False news and must be reported immediately
Lies
Take this fake as sh*t down wtf

Dwayne Johnson death hoax: No, The Rock didn’t die after failed stunt<br>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has become the target of a viral death hoax.
