❗️ATTENTION❗️<br>On Felix’s next video, let’s all just watch the LAST 30 SECONDS of the video for the first 24 HOURS of it being uploaded. Then after that, we can watch the entire video. Might be fun to see Felix freak out thinking he’s been gone for too long. We’ll be good 9 yr old children if we give him a good welcome like this, <i>Le epic prank!</i>

Sad to say but I believe there is copyrighted music being used possibly without permission in this fan game. They are using pieces from TeamFourStar&#39;s &#39;We are number one (But it&#39;s perfect)&#39;, and I can&#39;t find credit to them.
Pewds didnt recognize the Yes Yes Yes Yes jojo referance, you disappointed me Felix
Brasil good

Eh, Dunkey did it first.
I LOVE YOU PEWDIEPIE

Felix please stop calling Iran Airen
I feel bad he had to play that
You know it&#39;s a good game when it starts off with a jojo reference
This is innacurate, why does pewds had legs, he should be levitating:&quot;((
Incidentally<br>“Bogo” means stupid in Cebuano xD
who wants to see a speedrun of this?

Sad currently the first on trending for gaming is a video by fgteev and this is second.
Pewds has a huge damn p
Did you really said Where were you, when club penguin was kill.<br><br><br>I was at house eating doritos
this feels like a wierd fever dream<br>I’m not sure I’m alive anymore
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=975">16:15</a> og&#39;s remember
this game is so unrealistic pewdiepie has legs like thats the  most unrealistic thing ever
Potato salad
Somebody does this to a big company and they sue their asses. Pewdiepie does the opposite
He has the power of God and anime on his side
Where can I find this game?
This game is inaccurate, pewdiepie doesn’t have legs
The developer of the game now can use this video to improve the game with real pewdiepie reading dialogues
#2 on trending for gaming
He looks like Connor McDavid on the cover
Peediepoo plus LEGO star war + red redemption
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=494">8:14</a><br><br>Pewds: &quot;Why do you hate me Japan? I just want to be in you!&quot;<br>Japan: <b>&quot;My borders, my choice&quot;</b>
Does anyone have the link to that We Are Number One remix?
That Star Wars Bar brings back memroies

&quot;Kinda weird hearing yourself&quot; - Felix 2020, a man who has recorded and edited videos of himself for years
It&#39;s Kool aid with another name, not going to drink Kool Aid with another name Felix
Felix is the Duolingo owl reminding us to play his games.
Damn this is insane for a fan game
pewdiepie: <b>doesnt notice naruto reference at </b><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=1066">17:46</a></b> <br>me: <b>sad weeb noises</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=4">0:04</a> IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?
Pewds making a Star Wars reference<br>Fans: So HeS nOt A BoOmER!!!
Felix: im in iran
Kaioken<br>Is it Fullmetal Alchemist refernce??
His weapon is a big PP
Felix hates ASS!!!!
the jojoke  though
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=52">00:52</a>, if Felix double wields the weapon, does he have big PP energy?
I mean this is a really well done game. It&#39;s basically was made to appeal a single person (Felix).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=146">2:26</a><br>Pewdiepie: Now this is fricking podracing!
ppdie
This video is fake and those &quot;legs&quot; are paid actors.
In all seriousness, considering how much work goes into making a game, this really isn&#39;t half bad.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=160">2:40</a> hahah I’ve watched star wars so I understand 😏
OMG YES PEWDS IM SO HAPPY YOU FOUND THIS I GOT IT OVER SUMMER AND WANTED YOU TO PLAY THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE

PewDiePie, I&#39;m not sure if you know, but someone Made a PewDiePie companion mod for Fallout 4

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=118">1:58</a> this car looks like the car from Gta online&#39;s dlc &quot;arena wars&quot;
Felix: I like the weapon, it&#39;s a giant P<br><br>Me: it&#39;s a big PP
He doesn&#39;t know what kaioken is
Cringe
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0hWlevaJ8&amp;t=497">8:17</a> Anyone else get uncomfortable when Felix said &quot;I just want to be in you&quot;

Remember when Pewds just used to eat Gfuel from the bucket, mad times.
Comment &quot;Giveaway&quot; on my recent video and watch it to be entered in a huge giveaway😊😊
Felix: I finally watched JoJo guys I understand all the references<br>Game: <b>has a JoJo reference within the first 10 seconds in the video</b><br>Felix: <b>doesn’t get the reference</b>
Pewdiepie is God
The fucking mos Estonia cantina.<br>PLAY LEGO STAR WARS THE COMPLETE SAGA!!!
they should give this game online servers
I like how pewds has been married to g-fuel longer then he’s been married to his wife
without Felix knowing he was in Iran before WW3 in the pod race
The weapon should have been a trebusae
This game is clearly fake or it is fake legs
1/10. pews doesnt have legs
why isnt pewds using his limited edition &quot;pewdiepie g-fuel&quot;, glow in the dark mug hmmm ??? UwU
im sorry, piedewpew, but donkey played this already
The pewd weapon should’ve been a harvesting tool in fortnite
Felix: <b>Grants the 19 year olds back to 9</b><br><br>Also Felix: <i>”Actually they’re 1 9 nOw!”</i><br><br>19 year olds: <b>Sad 9 year old noises</b>

Over a billion animals have died in the Australian fire🙏
It’s literally LEGO Star Wars on cracccc
This game looks so good and pewdiepie just takes it for granted. Too big for his britches.
Mx
&quot;How to take a break for dummies&quot; i mean you could just detox from social media/youtube and limit yourself to certain useful apps then do whatever else you wannna do as a hobby. take a walk get a massage, read a book, watch movies/shows, even watch YouTube just don&#39;t make anything. whatever it is u feel like doing. From a week to a month should be enough for you to feel mentally refreshed and come back with a ton of video ideas that you might have had while on break.
ok<br>&#39;
Is this a meme game...?
