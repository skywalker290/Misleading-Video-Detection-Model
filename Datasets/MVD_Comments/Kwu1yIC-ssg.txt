I wanted NZ to win that match🥲
Newzealand deserve that world cup 🥹
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=160">2:40</a> That Wicket Was Just 🥵
And I have to say it. Why aren&#39;t we still using guptill? One of the greatest t20 and odi batsmen ever don&#39;t care what anyone says
The worst thing about this for me is before the era of t20 and the super over.. if an odi was tied it went to the team that lost the least amount of wickets. I dont agree that the team who scored more boundaries should win the game because its a lot harder scoring runs without boundaries by running between the wickets so i think get rid of the most boundary rule and go back to who lost least wickets in the original innings. Or just have another super over that would have been so much fairer
The most unluckiest run out ever 😢
There should be another super over.....
2019 icc world cup final in lords and 2022 qatar world cup final in lusail . we just wintness the greatest world cup finals of the two greatest sport in the world🤩🗿
Request for icc please make highlights atleast 25minutes especially a legendary match like this🥶
Yes
Williamson after win :🙂<br>Williamson after lose:🙂 <br>Respect for that guy👇
Nz is always unlucky
If martin guptil use his mind and smartly look to run only 1 then it might be 2nd super over
Whata  match
Kane Williamson ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ben stokes wrong
Umpire&#39;s decision is wrong for that over throw. if it may not be happen blackcaps may won
Nz deserves😢
iam was lucky i watching in stadium
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=330">5:30</a> that was cheating 😢
Lance klusener in 1999<br>Ganguly in 2003<br>Sanga in 2011 <br>Heartbreaking 💔
England didn&#39;t deserve this World Cup 😢 the over throw rule is dumb af, it cost New Zealand a well deserved world cup win
Ab to nafrat ho gayi hai 240 aur 241 number se 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=311">5:11</a> that one six and that overthrown by mistake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=335">5:35</a> that mistake causes the loss for NZ
I dont know why but i feel bad for NZ 😢.. this team deserves a world cup from years they are trying but badluck evertime they got knocked out
I like ben❤❤
Nz deserves the WC
Zidane cursed Italy<br>Williamson cursed England 😂
As an Indian even i feel for newzealand they deserved the win 😢
I think New Zealand should have nominated Guptill and Kane Williamson. Why Neesham was there? Williamson plays better than Neesham and is above him only as top order batsman
Q
W
Whenever I saw this match,It makes me feel thrilled and excited for next ball though I know who won.Jofra archer😮😮😮
Newzealand winner
I am happy for England because nz defeated India
Ian Smith mouth shut...useless kiwis.any team wud hav pulled this this off except the Kiwis 😂 cudnt get 5 off 3 to win a  World Cup
Moral of the story:Boundary &gt;&gt;Running
Observe field se
Stokes icc ke niyam ko toda kyuki bat se bowl ko Marne ka adhikar nhi hai.icc niyam ke tahat stokes out tha.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=311">5:11</a> If the catch was taken then Nz would be win this match
If Guptill didn&#39;t attempt to hit the ball and had stayed in place, he could have received a wide, but the chance was missed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=414">6:54</a>If Boult didn&#39;t bowl a full toss in find of yorker they will win. Feel bad for Williamson
Anyone after 🇮🇳V🇦🇫 3rd t20 😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=468">7:48</a> Guptill has chance wide ball. If he didn&#39;t hit
The most exciting match of all-time
It was for New Zealand for real.
England did not win. period
They should send a ken Williamson and rose Taylor
England won the world cup by their luck otherwise the cup was for New Zealand
If stokes and buttler were not in this match england were losing this match
Buttler and stokes partnership is into super england
Ian Smith comentry  is just wow in final
India jo kuch nz se sikhna chahiye kaise khelte he knockouts matches india ko final me 241 runs defeat nahi hiye aur nz ne super over tak match ko leke gaye 😢
Just imagine buttler made a mistake at the last moment and nz win the cwc
Last ball of super over...OMG that would have been a wide ball men OUTSIDE THE LEG STUMP😢😢😢😢😢....Just needed some awrness
Both teams made equal runs in super over
❤❤❤
Luckiest persons are those who watched this legendary match live 🫶🏻❤️
Who is watching this final in 2024
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2024
But
New Zealand lose because of boult and guptil
Nz win the cwc2019 easily but because of martin guptill miss field and can&#39;t take a songle two run new zealand lose shame on you guptil
Cheating from stokes
The most thrilling match or a final!!!!!!
Tie rule was very bad.......It was not justice one for New Zealand....
England  great team😊😊😊😊
What a bad rule... Very sad for NZ best team in the world in my view really they deserve this world cup 😔
I am seeing this match highlight in 2024
Bad luck for newzealand
I am a Bangladeshi. But I am crazy fan of New Zealand, even I love New Zealand as my country. My only dream is to live to see a World Cup in the hands of Bangladesh and New Zealand. (Sorry my english is so week).
There won&#39;t ever be another CWC final like this...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63IBgil8YJE">https://youtu.be/63IBgil8YJE?feature=shared</a>
Buttler innings is underrated
I fell very nice for ms Dhoni due to that dangerous run out bu Jos Buttler to Martin Guptill
England shouldn’t have won that at ALL. And 4 years later they call the Aussies cheats!? Those bastards. But great job not feuding with England New Zealand, you’re a true gracious sporting country.
India and NZ both scored 240 in finals.   Only thing newzealand succeded is their bowling.
Although being indian it still hurts me  for newzealand team. when i imagine this 2019 final.
Boundary count champion 🤭🤭🤭
Ferguson should have bowled that super over. He was both economical and wicket taking as well.Boult was quite expensive.
2019 world cup was way way better then 2023 world cup
New zealand win wc 2019 beimani ki hai england ne
New Zealand deserves this world cup they did so good at the final
Kismat meherbaan<br>To gadha pehelwaan
Rip for those people who sleeps early💀
same target india gave to australia in cwc 2023 finals
Brain structure coronavirus
What a match
The fact that this got a huge english casual audience should tell you just how entertaining this game was in a country for which cricket rarely makes the front page
Why 23 wc highlights isn’t here🙁
Ok let&#39;s accept ICC ROBBED NEWZEALAND. 😢<br><br>1. ben stokes controversy<br>2. rule of super over tie<br>3. if these match was been played 3 yrs later ben stokes could not have played last ball when eng required 2 in 1.
How two teams are equal run why England win
This is one of the greatest final of WORLD CUP HISTORY
2019 world cup was more memorable than 2023 world cup.
Iss match ko live dekh ne ka ghamand hai 😅😅😅
Greatest match I have ever seen
Most underserved world cup.. no wonder the  English always rob
My heartbreak as an Indian fan after the 2023 final pales in comparison to what NZ fans must have felt after this final. Geez
Best ever World Cup Final ❤❤❤❤
World Cup win england but heart win newzealand ❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=333">5:33</a> Wasn&#39;t actually Stokes fault but it was really unfair for Nz and the reason they lost the Match
Agony for nz
Actually there has to be another  super over 🏆
One of the best games of cricket ever and also the most unfair. They should&#39;ve shared the trophy.
The even closure scores of 2023(241) and here 2019(240) .<br>Fact batting first teams lost this wc edition especially this 2019 wc is so hard.😢
Anyones here ? after the 2023 world cup!!!
This is still the best match in cricket history after another world cup 🔥🔥😣 but iam sad NZ didn&#39;t won this and this year they lost to ind in semis 😣😭

THE MOST LEGENDARY MATCH IN CRICKET HISTORY..I AM LUCKY I SAW THIS LIVE❤
My wish is newzealand must win😢 so unlucky. I&#39;m big fan of newzealand team. Since Stephen Fleming Era he is cool and smart captain
Undoubtedly best odi world cup final ever 👌👌👌
Who is here after 2023 ODI World Cup final?
I missed this match but this was marvelous
If anyone wondering how England won. In this Cricket World Cup final, both England and New Zealand ended up with the same score after 50 overs, leading to a Super Over. The Super Over also ended in a tie. However, according to the rules at that time, the team with the higher boundary count during the match and the Super Over combined was declared the winner. <br><br>In this case, England had a higher boundary count than New Zealand with 9 more boundaries, so they were declared the winners. This rule, known as the boundary countback rule, was quite controversial and has since been changed by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Now, if a Super Over ends in a tie, it will be followed by another Super Over(s) until there is a winner. This change was made to avoid the kind of controversy that arose from the 2019 final.
Long live ODI Cricket !!!
After india 240 in world cup Final😢😂😢😂😢😂😢😢😢
Boundary Count Champions 😂
Bad rule, boundry counting
Won by 0 runs 😂😂😂    <br>💔New Zealand
2023 : India played against Australia in their first match, then Australia won<br>2023 : Team which will play against sa in their first match will win the world cup<br>This trend is valid for 2023 and 2027 world cup, Mark my words.
Nz deserve
umpire is so fool
Peak cricket ever played right there

Almost same score
New Zealand deserved this world cup so much
Whos here before the 2023 wc final ❤
Here just before 2023 world cup final 😂
The last point - If the super over is tied then the team who scores more boundaries in the super over will win. <br><br>England - 2 boundaries<br>Nz - 1 boundarie <br><br>So england win.
I wat hed thiscmatch 100 times
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=338">5:38</a> Ian Smith : CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS (CRAP) ??
Isse dekhkar kal kya hoga soch rha hu 😮
Best match in cricket history at the same time worst dessission by icc😢😢😢
Watching this the night before the 2023 world cup final. This will forever remains the greatest cricket match ever played.
Biggest match in the history ❤
I couldn&#39;t understand new Zealand needed 2 runs from one <a href="http://ball.new/">ball.new</a> Zealanders got out when they were tooking 2 run  .so match again tied because both teams made15 runs in superover😮😢.
My point of view New Zealand win this
We all know real winner is NZ
Unfair match<br>NEW Zealand deserved 😭😭😭😭😭
Undoubtedly the best final ever in history of ODI WC. what an edge of the seat thriller it was❤️
ENGLAND MADAR CHO*** HAI
As a fan of Ken Mama, I could not get over this trauma.
NZ actually deserved it<br>There should have been one more super over,<br>The rule of Max boundaries is just unfair and bullshit.
This game was like the F1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix 2021. Hamilton deserved the win, Verstappen deserved the championship<br><br>NZ deserved the win, England deserved the WC
2019 Cricket World Cup Final Eng Vs Nz<br><br>2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Priz Hamilton vs Verstappen<br><br>2022 FIFA World Cup Final Arg vs Fra<br>Cant believe i watched perhaps the greatest games of the sports in 3 years
I fail to fathom what&#39;s the meaning of life in the eyes of Williamson. The life, that never completes his favorite chapter. After all these years, the Kiwis have smelled glory but never touched. 3 semi&#39;s &amp; 1 final since 2011. The nicest of the Fab 4 is defeated again. The smile stays, the pain grows. Why me? Why us? Kane walks off with his troops in sorrow. Chin up, something better is always written for all.
This match still hurts😢😢
Guptil last ball jaane deta to wo wide tha
Who is here after seeing the semi final
Man, boundary countback was not a good rule. They could&#39;ve gone the IPL way and had another super over. Winning just because of more boundaries is not sportsmanship, it&#39;s sheer disrespect of it.
what a match, i had enjoyed back then
Kane Williamson&#39;s coach Johnston interview-I remember Kane coming back home from that heart-breaking World Cup final in 2019. He was utterly gutted. I wouldn’t say he was pretty hollow, but was numb for a long time. It wasn’t because he was angry at the loss – it was just difficult to process that strange game. New Zealand didn’t lose the game; yet they lost the World Cup.
Stupid decision by ICC. Pure cheating by England.😢
Anybody here ? After 2023 Newzealand semi final defeat ? ... Kane😢❤
Boundary count champions
New Zealand wins
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=469">7:49</a> if only Guptil didn&#39;t play that ball it was a wide ball anyway
This is not lose for NZ and Win for England🙂
What a bad luck for New Zealand 😢
And here we are 4.5 years later for 2023 WC with India vs Australia final at Ahmedabad. Can India end the trophy drought from 10 years?
Nz played immensely ❤️❤️
We Indians consider NZ as a winner
Legendary match ever ❤❤😮
This machat ws new zland
😂 2023 England is struggling from asthama and so many excuses
True winner newzealand but umpire worst decision gave extra run for England. Heart broken moment for newzealand especially kane Williamson
The robbery
Yepp, the best ODI ever !!!
Shitest Game of cricket ever saw in my life, Started hating cricket after that game.
Wow ❣️
I was only 9 only nine years old, but I still remember this match. That was a legendary match
Number of fours are you kidding me, terrible rule
Now we know why ben stokes is called bhenchod
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=334">5:34</a> thats so unfair to new zealand<br>those 4 runs shouldn&#39;t have counted
new zealand robbed
This Was My Life&#39;s first match that I watch live with interest ❤
Neesham 😢
idiot umpire dharamsena
Just came here to watch this after NZ&#39;s ousting from WC23 Semis. This Game was legendary.
NZ deserved this game, better luck 2023 .
England,the most over hyped team.
ben strokes did that on purpose
England was deserving or not we dont know but yeah in 2023,England is out and tomorrow, Ind vs NZ is going to be played.<br><br><br>And that&#39;s Semi-final 😅
Why 1 run was counted at te last ball (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=370">6:10</a>) although he was runout? Because in new zealand super over he got no run at all at the last ball (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=472">7:52</a>). He was also run out but no run was counted. Can someone explain?
But in 2023 the history is changed India defeat all teams.
Ye cheating thi
Uboy to 15 run nilo eng jitlo kibave?
GOAT Match
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=326">5:26</a><br>Who thought it would be a camouflage six.<br>Love to see Stokes in this situation. He&#39;s the best man fitting in there. <br>Love from Pakistan
Jo ham log aaj dekh rahe hai kal koi aur dekhega aur jo kal koi aur dekhega to parso koi aur dekhega (zindgi ki yahi raftar hai koi apne mil jate hain to koi apne bichhar jate hai)ham log apne jiwan me es tarah busy ho chuke hain ki hamare 4 saal kaise bit gaye pata bhi nahi chala😢😢
This is the worst way to win a world cup, what a horrible rule of no of fours. Terrible luck for new zealand, they deserved truly.
Resting the right leg on the left toes by crossing it over the left leg and striking the Dumbells in front of left thigh, keeping the arms straight.<br><br>Returning to the position of attention 3-4. Repeating steps 1 and 2 with the left leg on the right toes.
You won&#39;t see a final like this because it would be obe sided as India is way too strong this time.
I am so sad that I slept through this 😢
I watched this with my grandparents in India and was so ecstatic when England won. It was a memory to cherish with your loved ones. RIP Grandad! Happy I watched it with you.
Chills ahead this 2023 wc😂
We should have a rematch for the trophy. I still can&#39;t digest England being declared a winner 🏆
I always appreciate the English crowd, they live up to my expectations everytime.<br><br>Not only they support England but they do appreciate the other batsmen as well, love it.
Ye kibi ab kabi world kab nahi jitega itna accha moka tha salo
Cheater icc cheater england
After watching condition of England in 2023.     Just realised never do bad with a good person 😢
Achha hua nz har gya salaaa
That 4 run was painful
14th july 2019 (Sunday) Who are see this match live ✨️ (Thrilling match) 👍<br>A unforgettable match in cricket world cup History ❤️✨️
This is called the final . The greatest of all times
Icc and your useless rules . England won because if boundaries.  So in the end if the result is not coming out in super over and winner decide by the boundaries,  so why you guys want batsman to run a wicket 1 run 2 run or 3 run. If match in the end is decided by the boundaries so all the players must hit boundaries.  Icc come out useless logic and rules .
That time England was just lucky...coz this time in 2023 wc the Nz&#39;s were thrashed them very badly n showed them their place...actually the fact is that the new Zealand team are way better than them...
Legends Watching On 2024😢🎉
Hello sir good
Credit for ben stokes 💥
The biggest bs i ever saw, England didnt deserve it, anyone telling me otherwise is an idiot
Stokes The Most Cheat Player❌<br>England The Most Cheat Team✅
Give the commentator a trophy. 😂
One of the greatest worldcup final in cricket history ❤️❤️🥵🤩
Newzealand was the more deserving winner first that boundary that eng got during taking a run from stokes bat if that would not have happened Newzealand would have won the match without even going into super over
New Zealand could have won the world cup if there would be a  better rule and New Zealand is a world champion
Karma England karma... England also won fifa world cup by doing rubbish things..here also..
I was laughing when benstokes innocently ups his hands nd says this is not my fault😂😂

The most seat edged thriller and nail biting match i had ever seen in cricket history 🔥🔥
Game was great but there should be another super over.
England and New Zealand: main jhukega nai sala😎
i remember watching this, the wimbledon and the British gp all at the same time. Brilliant day from sports.
New Zealand are the most unluckiest team england won it by unfair rules Tbh and now england is humiliated in 23Cwc😂
who de fck watch this &quot;sport&quot; 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>and why?<br>What is this shit?
Due to unfair decisions england won
After 4 years ,  in 2023 England is out of wc and NZ is in top 4 .... This is cricket
England dumped out of wc
Shame
shame on you
England never deserved this final win. Because:<br>1. Stokes wasn&#39;t given out when he obstructed the field clearly, that accidentally provided 4 runs to the team.<br>2. How on earth can a final winner be decided on basis of boundary count. England were just handed the cup rather than New Zealand winning it on merit.<br>3. England collapsed badly when they were made to bat on wickets that weren&#39;t quite helpful for batters. In group stages, they were battered by Australia and SriLanka on tricky wickets. It was only against India they won whivh saved their world cup. In final also, barring Stokes, Buttler and Bairstow, no batter lasted long.<br><br>Now its 2023, England have been humiliated in the world cup and their batters collapsed on Indian pitches as they thought they can score 300-400 every single match but they are just flat track bullies but shit their pants on proper wickets. They are now in danger of missing out on 2025 Champions Trophy Qualifications which seems very likely now.
Legend match ever
After watching England performance in 2023 world cup 😂
Best match of the century
Nz ❤❤q
NZ deserves this, that 4 runs from stokes hand 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I&#39;m unlucky. Cant seen live 😢❤

Unlucky newzealand 😢😢
Without Ben Stokes England couldn&#39;t have won it...What a legend he&#39;s!

Not an agony for NZ it is a lack of administration of icc for implementing proper rules
Williamson keep smiling ❤😂
Dharmasena cost new Zealand World cup..... A complete idiot
Spirit of cricket? Not there. When is suits England they are fine, when it doesn’t they complain.
The most fucking moment of cricket truly unjustice there was a home advantage for england so nz should be the winner but cricket was discovered in eng its their rule i will never accept eng have won a wc legally
4 years.... But still thriller and goosebumps
Craziest match Ever 🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐

Watching when NEESHAM run outs against Australia in last over in WC 2023
Nz was much deserving team. Finally Karma has hit back 😊
Wth that wasn&#39;t a 4 ben strokes got in the way
Why didn&#39;t they do one more super over?
Who is here in 2023?
Most unfair trophy given to England, and karma is back as of now staying on the foot of other teams in worldcup 23
Similar match today<br>Newzealand vs Australia on 28 oct 2023 <br>Jimmy Nisham is so underrated man!!!!!!!!!

FORTHEMOMENTSTHATMATTER
Anyone 2023 ✋🏻
Eng cheating krke hi jeeta first cwc😂
Let me place my comment here ...<br><br>&quot;This match both shocked and shaked the world of cricket in 2019..<br>Back then I was in 10 grade witnessing this live the next day headlines on the newspaper were <br>&quot;ONE TEAM WON THE CUP AND OTHER WON THE HEARTS ❤&quot; this was a very controversial and at the same time very thrilling match..&quot;<br><br>I am posting this comment during 2023 world cup where NZ,SA,AU and India are playing really well...<br>So far India 🇮🇳  in indisputable New Zeeland 🇳🇿 is on fire and South Africa 🇿🇦  is making world records with 425+ runs and Australia 🇦🇺 is Crowling too
Guys in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=369">6:09</a>, it was 2 from 1 ball and it was a run out too so why was that 1 run counted as it was a run out ?? But in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=478">7:58</a> the same thing happened, it was 2 from 1 ball and the players ran once and then got run out so why wasnt that 1 run counted this time ?? Someone explain plz
How times have changed 😂😂😂
No one is winner ok 😢
England are out of the 2023 world cup lol
What a thrilling match in the history of WC odi.....
NZ deserved the WC. Eng just won due to some rubbish rules. Eng took away what was actually NZ&#39;s. So this year thay are getting the payback.
Today England r out of cwc😢
Here after England got knocked brutally out of the 2023 Cricket World Cup 😂
England&#39;s present or we can say poor performance in WC 2023 clear all doubts that they didn&#39;t win the 2019 WC infact England was declared winner of the match. (156/10 ve Sri Lanka)
Nz didn&#39;t have this win in their destiny , first the four extra runs from stokes&#39; bat then not able to make 5runs from 3 balls despite hitting a huge thang over mid-wicket by neesham.. and deciding the winner on the basis of boundaries  , its all about destiny
That was unfair match in tie match england won world cup
As an Indian when I was a kid I thought new Zealand were the true winners
All time best match cricket no one beat tha match awasome 😊❤ match bad luck nz loss tha world cup true winner nz team ❤
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳২০২৩ 😊😊😊😊
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=363">6:03</a> the non striker is out of crease before the ball is bowled.... Clearly a short run attempt.... Huh! That&#39;s why The great Ian Smith said- &quot;By the barest of margins&quot;
Barest of margins
Ben stokes is on of the greatest cricketers and cheaters as well
ICC ki ma ki chu**t ,Puri highlights nhi de skte
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇳🇿
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇳🇿
England played way better than New Zealand,no way this was unfair for New Zealand
England won 🏆 <br>New Zealand won ❤
In this year 2023 india  host world cup and india win
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=333">5:33</a> this was the game changer
Most unfair match in world
Draw in the main match<br>Draw in the super over<br>One of the most rarest matches that too in a world cup finals
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇳🇿
It should be decided on sixes not on boundaries,,,
The most valueable Robbery by Englishmen<br>After India&#39;s colonialism
classic wc not like fkin 23
Falsely england win
England ki maa ki chut phele to six count kiya phir 0 run se hare matlab inki gand ke loda tumhari maa ki chut teri gand me loda angrej maa ki chut cheating bhen ke lode angrej unki maa ki chut
Well done England , what a cheating on home ground 😂, good message spreading from  so called mighty UK 😂
worst game rules ever. Pathetic.
That guy literally touched the ball with his bat by running through that side. His intentions were clear. L England W Newzland
Actually new Zealand wins in the super over<br><br>Because if super over ties then the team which have taken highest wickets Considered as winners<br><br>New Zealand 241-8<br>England 241-10<br><br>New Zealand has taken 10 wickets and England has taken 8 wickets
From champions of 2019 wc to now bottom of the table in 2023 wc 😂😁 karma of being boundary champions
Tit for tat 😂 guptill run out ms dhoni in semi final and he also runout by runout 😂
Newzeland jeeta ta empire b and he ty or aj usi chz ki saza ha k england Apne se kamtr teams se b har rha h 2023 ma Allah ka insaf ha
Newzeland win kia ta cheering se england jeeti ti
New zealand deserve the win❤
Stokes my Favourite
Match to super over mein v draw hua tha 15 runs fir keise englnd jiti..or ekbr hona tha superover
Chit game win new Zealand <br>I from 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
New Zealand win
Ben Stockes always use unfair means. He once got out while trying to stop ball from hitting stumps with his glove andhere used bat to get overthrow 4 which was unfair. It&#39;s what Englishman have done from start of time.
यह मेरे सामने सबसे अच्छा मैच रहा है
Commentary was in God mode
The craziest game of cricket ever played.
19 ka semifinal ka bhut dukh hua
Nz also scored 15 runs, then how can be england declared as winners?
23?
What a match it was… neck to neck competition, felt so bad for New Zealand bcz of that throw, otherwise they would have won it
Sorry for NZ
New Zealand deserved it 😥.. BUT IT WAS THE MOST LEGENDRY MATCH I HAVE SEEN. I WAS SO LUCKY THAT I SAW IT LIVE
If Boundry count rule is cheating then NZ reached SF due to rain &amp; Cheating <br>PAK won against BAN, SA, NZ, ENG, AFG {beat 3 big teams}<br>NZ won against SL, BAN, WI, AFG &amp; SA {beat 1 big team}
New Zealand gives extra 4 runs hitting the bat
,🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩♥️
सुपर ओवर टाई हुआ है भैंंण के लोडों 😡😠🤬
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=332">5:32</a> karma hits  back………..😂😂I
It was a great blunder from the umpire who gave 6 runs to the batting side for that throw from Guptil that deflected to the boundary. The former ICC elite Panel umpire Simon Taufel said as per the rules, the umpires should have awarded England five runs instead of six as the batsmen didn’t cross when Guptil released the ball from deep. Unfortunately Kumar Dharamasena awarded one run extra (6 runs total) that costed Newzealand worldcup. It is to be noted that the umpire was successfully reviewed twice in the same game.
We have to give credit to Archer as well...he has held his nerves very well at the end ......
Yeah England won by cheating
Boundary champion 😂🤣
That is such a painful loss, I feel even more bad for the kiwis than India. Icc should&#39;ve have let them both share the trophy instead of making up such a ridiculous rule.
My hear for Nz❤
The last run out😮😮😮
What a match !!!!!
I&#39;m probably the only English person with this view but I will never recognise this World Cup win for the following reasons:<br><br>I personally believe that a dead ball should be called when the ball accidentally hits a player&#39;s bat as he&#39;s running. <br><br>The reason batsmen don&#39;t run when one of them deflects the ball away from a fielder in the process of running is because they know it&#39;s not fair to get runs like that, so it&#39;s ridiculous that the umpires have to say &quot;sorry, there&#39;s nothing we can do but give 4 runs&quot; when the ball goes all the way to the boundary off a running batsman&#39;s bat.<br><br>Deciding a World Cup final(or any game) by the amount of boundaries scored by each side is a complete nonsense.<br><br>Lastly and most importantly, the umpires erroneously awarded England 1 more run than they were entitled to, so New Zealand should&#39;ve won the game by 1 run*.<br><br>*Umpire Kumar Dharmasena&#39;s decision to award England six runs following an overthrow boundary in the final over was criticised by former international umpire Simon Taufel, who said it was an &quot;error in judgment&quot; and a &quot;clear mistake&quot; by the on-field umpires.<br><br>Law 19.8 of the Laws of Cricket says &quot;If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be: any runs for penalties awarded to either side; the allowance for the boundary; and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.&quot; <br><br>As Stokes and Adil Rashid had not crossed at the moment the New Zealand fielder threw the ball, England should only have been awarded one completed run in addition to the overthrow boundary. <br><br>Dharmasena later admitted he made an error.
Who y’all got this year? I think it’s gonna be either Nz or India
So if Nz just did 1 run at the end, it would’ve been another super over?
most historical match in cricket history❤
Where is this england😢😢😢...pls come back in form.
On boundary count and how they know England won instantly, it’s all set up, its just entertainment like WWE 😂
As an Indian, L New Zealand
Great revange from NEW ZEALAND ❤❤❤❤❤ 5th oct 2023🎉🎉🎉🎉
Such a types of nail bitting game only possible to see in dream.undoubtly most memorable game in my life ever❤😮
Ben stokes is perfect finisher❤
Incredible match but nof fair with nz one more super over should be done as that was tied
England won that.  Luck by chance..  Stokes bat helped him
Cheater England
Cheaters
Very dangerous match
But l believe new Zealand won the match
they both scored 15, how did england win
This is the GOAT match no doubt no debate and i am lucky to watch this live 😊❤
Believe it or not, luck favored England team the moment ball was redirected towards boundary by ben stokes when he was trying to save himself from being run out. Also, the super over is tied, this stupid rule of winning by hitting more boundaries is now gone. Winners cannot be judged by that. And it took NZ&#39;s unfair loss for ICC to realize that. I so wish this was changed way earlier before the beginning of the tournament.
What a match ❤❤❤❤
Ben Stokes proves that he is the G.O.A.T. <br>Love From India 🇮🇳💙
Most thriller world cup final in the History of cricket  ! 😮😮
Best final💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
Biggest scam of 2019 part 1
Can&#39;t believe that 4 years have passed 😮
Dharmasena ruined it with awful umpiring. Worst of all time.
I&#39;m very sad for Kane Williamson I want to see him with holding the world cup
Why icc not upload cwc  2023 Highlight 🥺
2023 werking♥️
Hope black capz will loft their odi trophy this year under kane captaincy ❤
Most interesting WC Final in the cricket history ❤❤

Goosebumbs match❤😮
Who is here after the 1st match of WC 2023 😮
Who is here after the 1st match of WC 2023 😮
Agony for New zealand
NZ deserved that
I was supporting New Zealand with my heart, this really hurt, but we are winning this 2023 ICC WORLD CUP
that 4 overthrows in the last over from stokes&#39; bat could have been overturned. NZ had the decency to call a 6 when the fielder&#39;s foot touched the boundary ... england should have reciprocated by taking back those 4 runs. NZ will always win the fairplay award they always play in the spirit of cricket ... (mankading supporters won&#39;t understand)
In this match new Zealand was win
I am watching this match in 2023 oct 12
One of the greatest ever Wimbledon finals was on at the same time 😅
Why ICC don&#39;t upload highlights of 2023 World Cup matches?

Omg as an Indian I always heard that India vs Pakistan match was best but when I saw this live 4 years back omg this was the God played match both England and New Zealand have similar chances to win but yea the luck was with England so they win. Both teams played really well
England you are not winner, ICC gives their trophy to you the thieves, and beggar, the whole England country have not the potential to play against Team India.
Fake world cup
Maybe it was the beauty of lords ❤
New Zealand deserved it so much

whose after nz win over eng in 2023 world cup?
Martin guptill should leave the last ball of super over and it would be wide so ..... newzealand could win.
fours pace bowling good fielding alround show. hail the lord!
Controversial win😢😅
Can you imagine the moment when he realized that he is not going to make it and could have waited for another super over 💔
It was not tie in super over ?? 15 and 15 ??
Now wait for Pakistan v India in the finals 4 years of hard work and here we gonna and pak try to redeem their selves
England is a true cheater this match belonged to new zea land
real champion = always champion
The umpires gave six runs for overthrow but it was deflected from bat
Revenge Loaded 🔥🔥
Most unluckiest byes ever seen in life . .. from the hands of ben stokes.... 😢
No 👎👎 match can beat this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🕯️
New Zealand loss the match but win the respect from several countries as they don&#39;t give up even at the last moment
If Trent Boult had caught Ben Stokes, the NZ would have won at that time.
Pure luck for 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿......
getting goosebumps even after watching now ! What an incredible match and can&#39;t be witnessed such a match in lifetime huh..
The legendary match ever i see in my life and am lucky saw this match live ❤❤
Final * comes with a asterisk because scoreboard error in which the other side actually won
Dharmasena gave 6 runs on a bye...what a corrupted game...better give wc before the tournament starts
Scam 2019...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=334">5:34</a> game changing scene

Number 1 mach in cricket history is this
Things were too sketchy. People are not fool. New Zealand won the match without any super over. 😅
❤️🇮🇳❤ will win
It&#39;s not fare 😔 because I not think that who hit more sixes can considered has world cup but it was world cup it&#39;s not a cup of tea 😂 Why ICC can not make the rule that who hit more four that will win the Match. Hence The World Cup Final Was Fixed 😂
Best world Cup final match of all time.
Watching this match highlights today . Because the World Cup is starting today and the first match is between them.
Best final in WC history
I was praying for NZ loss😂
Newzealand deserved such loss 😂
What a game😮😮😮 OMG

Again they&#39;ll clash in the 1st match in the ICC MEN&#39;S CRICKET WORLD CUP INDIA 2023. This rivalry between England vs New Zealand is getting amazing 😍.❤😮😊
This match was amazing 😍 between England vs New Zealand final in the 2019 cricket world cup. England 241 in their 50 overs and New Zealand 241 in their 50 overs. Match Tied. However England won the match by the boundary count. And they&#39;re the Champions of The ICC MEN&#39;S CRICKET WORLD CUP England 2019 final.❤😮😊.
It still gives me goosebumps after 4 years passed!😮
So, here we go again 2023 WC&#39;s 1st match hope kiwis gets their unfinished job done today pending since last 4 years
Match Tied Howa Hai Baimani Se English Ko Jitaya Gaya Hai Cricket Ejad Karne Wale Aaj Tak World Champion Jo Nahi Bane Is Liye Aik Bar Aur Super Over Dena Chaye Tha
Cheating with nz😂😂😂
Life is unfair at times. New Zealand losing less wickets than England still lost the game on boundary count😢
If you ask me, New Zealand should win this,
I suddenly watched this and I realises tomorrow is start of CWC23  just how fast the night changes
Worst Rule... 🤣 There have been two World Cups since <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%232011">#2011</a>, but the memories of 2011 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23worldcup">#WorldCup</a> is still fresh in our minds &amp; Hearts. 🇮🇳 ❤
Cheter England
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=111">1:51</a> clearly ball over the high but umpire had other plan 😔😔
This is whats called match fixing. Perfect finish for a final.😂
Agony agony for newzealand 🥲💯
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=465">7:45</a>
Ab tak  ke behad ghatiya  tarike se world cup jeet eng ki  5 saal ho gaye per abhi tak bhul nahi pa raha real winner on my side is NewZealand with heart.❤😢

Most thrilling match I&#39;ve ever seen. The real winner was nz
🔥🔥🔥
The best cricket match ever.
Kiwis deserved this match to win because rules are shit 💩
Karma hits new zealand they won semi final with runout and loss final with runout
Revenge day tomorrow 🎉🎉. The rivalry continues....
It&#39;s been four years since England won the World Cup and four years since New Zealand won our hearts.
Unfare for newzealand team😅😅😅
A champion without defending or chasing the score,,what a rule🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
New Zealand 241 runs with 8 wickets. England were bowled out for 241 runs. So it is clear that New Zealand has won the match
New Zealand opened well against England, New Zealand should have won the match. But England was the favorite team for ICC
The result is that the team with more Bondaris will win the match. What a joke
New Zealand Would take revenge from you in 2024 ...Wait for it you England cricket ...
England won by luck ben stroke bat came in middle of the throw and it went for boundary . If that was not the scenario then newzeland would  have won the cup
Agony...! Agony for New Zealand 🇳🇿
Great effort by ICC to keep cricket alive in england😂
Nz
Feeling sad for NZ 😢😢😢😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=475">7:55</a> what if ball slipped from buttler&#39;s hand.
England played in difficult phase on lords .2nd ining in lord not easy to bat . difficult condition.
4 years gone still 😮😮😮can&#39;t forget those matches something goosebumps 2019 cwc
“England have won the world cup by the barest of margins, by the barest of all margins. Absolute ecstasy for England. Agony, agony for New Zealand.” - Ian Smith

They should give one more super over 😡<br>They are giving World Cup to England same like offer
Actually England not deserving this world cup 👎🏻<br>I don’t what kind of rule to win england
Last bowl me down the ground    six lagana chahiye tha martin guptil ko
England 🇬🇧🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 can&#39;t able to win against Italy in final 2020 and you are saying salty to indians, can&#39;t win CWC final convincingly and you are saying salty to indians. Your nation&#39;s hooligan lads destroy everything, starts racial and verbal abuse to dark colour ones and Italy civilians and you are saying salty to indians. Btw this world cup your English lads are gonna vomit in between match when temp. will exceed 40 degree + and the scorching heat will ultimately burn your skins. There is nothing kept in cricket as well for you hooligans this year. No need to send england players to india for 2023 wc  because then it will become health and safety issue for them. Ever heard polar bear basking in between desert just to avoid racial controversy
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

❤ 2023 world cup winner 🏆 🇳🇿 new Zealand
How Eng won ? The super over was Tie although 😢
This year for New Zealand🇳🇿
I really dont understand why they granted 4runs for the overthrow that came from stokes bat while diving to the crease.. is that a rule?
Actually england not win this match... It&#39;s tied... So equally share both team.... As series tied they equally winner both team... Same as 2019 wc final
Neesham 👀
Greatest robbery of all time.
England never won this
Newzealand was real winner<br>Worst rules of ICC<br>Worst final
Worst final ever
❤
None is talking about Neesham performance
Maybe the best of the best world cup in history of ICC ❤️
Can we just talk how umpire made 2 wrong decisions in the final
Its how comic is that Smith said &quot; whoever scores more runs in the super over wins&quot; and it ties....barrest of all margins
This was absolutely wrong.... When ever a super over is tied then they should have a reserve day..... 👍
This match is full scripted.
The english Cheats it should be another super over
To think that if the stakes were not so high Guptill would have generally reacted sensibly and leave the last ball as wide 😅
Shame on ICC
Last Wc When The Players Are Legendary 😢 And in Form <br><br>Kane Williamson Is Injured This Wc 😢
It is four years since then. But as a newzealand fan I feel the heart break till now. You gotta fell for newzealand. But hope this time Newzealand finally won the WC 2023. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23backingblackcaps">#BackingBlackcaps</a>
इंग्लैंड धोखे से जीता है
Watching in 2023, It Still Give Goosebumps..🥶🔥
Practically england won the match<br>But newzeland won billion heart of cricket lovers ❤
I think that&#39;s not fare another super over need to the decide to the winner 🏆
Kya kaate ki takkar thi ❤❤❤
In super over also tied.

4 years on.. one of the greatest finals ever witnessed
Sad for NZ ♥️
Best match 🔥
Ben stokes still alive😮
Whats sad is i saw this live but i cant remember anything
Absolutely cheating match.. How can you declare a winner if both team super over scores are level what an shitty rule this..Felt sad for newzeland 😢
I see this match when ever I feel cricket is boring
You have the rights the full match. Please post it
Welcome to Narendra Modi stadium 🏟️❤
So badluck for newzealand.. they deserve the trophy...😢
Newzealand and south africa. They deserve to win but choke out in the end.
This is cheating for newzeland
How can a team be soooooooo unlucky 😢 Nz deserved to win it by all means
I think the winner should not had been declared by the number of boundaries but should have done another super over.
4 years iam grade 3 in live match tv
That free boundary by stokes bat at non striker end (extra runs)  was Nz&#39;s bad luck.  So sad for nz. We lost in semifinals but we all wanted to see them champion.
😊😊
Fix match tha
Kismat se jiti England deserve to New Zealand hi karti thi
EN❤
last ball was a wide, if guptill wouldve just left, sad
Whos going to win this world cup 2023?
2019 Final🔥<br>2015 Semi Final🔥<br>2011 Quarter Final 🔥<br>Cricket at it,s best ❤
Boalts bowling in super over was villain…..😢😢😢😢😢😢
heart breat match
Ben stokes ❤❤❤❤❤❤
there must be another super over if super over is going to be tie. we cant decide winner based on boundary in Cricket world cup. One of the most embarassing moment for cricket and its rule. gotta fell sad for NZ. one of the most unluckiest day in NZ cricket.
Best final in the history of 50 over world cup it&#39;s unbelievable how the  stokes had delivered
Utter bullshit...
Those 4 over throws off Ben Stokes bat should not have been allowed...this is brutal 😢
I saw this legendary match and live that day and now seeing back 4 four years have passed away.<br>What a wonderful memory it has become.
I still cry whenever i see this , nz will win 2023 world cups❤
New zealand deserves 😢
England  chiting
Legendary Eon Morgin
What a great match I remember that...that was just owsum
Brilliant highlights of the most incredible game of cricket. Can we take a moment to admire Ian Smith&#39;s commentary. It was 🔥🔥🔥
This will be remembered for generations across borders. Sad that cricket is dying i Englad, what a tragedy😢
An excellent match with both teams fighting to the end, but the best thing about it is the whinging from Indians, because apparently they&#39;re the world authority on cricket 😂😂
NEWZEALAND LOST BY 0 RUNS<br><br>ENGLAND ( WON) THE WORLD CUP BY 0 RUNS
READY FOR 2023 INDIA .. AFTER 4 YEARS LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENED 😂😂
😊😊
England cheater😂😢
Who is the winner😅
This game set a record of the most Heartbreaking Cricket 🦗
No one will see this again till the end of world,,  feeling blessed and lucky to saw it live
Who are watching before CWC23 World Cup 🏆
And i come here to see again this match after ben stock&#39;s come out of retirement scoring with 182 Against New zeeland! <br>❤
It is not fair for New Zealand, the ball hit Ben Stokes and went for overthrow that too a boundary. Before that ball 9 from 3 was required but after that it became 3 from 2 and they got 2 singles to tie....😢
bazz is back..
This will remain the greatest ODI for decades to come.

I don&#39;t konow how to play first in allrounder
What a silly rule - as a South African I believe another super over should’ve been played until a legitimate winner was crowned
Mostly only Indians and Pakistanis commenting 🤣
Cheating
Not a fair result for Kiwis as they have faced two back to back finals but couldn&#39;t lift the world cup
Live dekh kr boht dukh hua tha
World cup chor england
New Zealand deserved the wc. I still think to this day that it was an unfair match.
Greatest match of cricket ever ever I&#39;ve seen
Ben stokes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=80">1:20</a>. Clear noise
Getting to this highlights for goosebumps
I am here Now (2023) ❤<br><br><br>Love this Match ,Historical Match❤
2023 and Still giving goosebumps 👏💥
The hype should have gone for this sport instead of game of thrones final season
I saw this live , and experienced adrenaline rush 😅❤ , I was wondering what my condition would have been if Indian team was at this place 😅😅 then it would have been another level of excitement and nervousness too
Totally deserving NZ .
It doesn’t matter how many times I watch this I will never tire of it . One of the greatest finals in any sport
4 years ago I watched this match live but it still gives gouse bumps 😮
When the commentator said -&quot;by the barest of all margins&quot;, we all meant it💯
The greatest match of all time in any sport.
I am great
Stokes can easily hit the last ball to the leg side <br>I think it is scripted 😂
Wow brilliant ❤

probably one of cheating world cup
England won 🥰
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=474">7:54</a> Martin Guptill deserved the treatment as he broke millions of Indian fan&#39;s heart by getting Dhoni runout in semifinal.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=364">6:04</a> What if Stokes had just walked a bit forward and allowed the ball to go wide
Ben😊
English players are cheaters. Whole of England is cheater. They are cheap people. They should be banned.
England won for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=330">5:30</a> moment
Everytime you watch you think that blackcaps were robbed

Liam Plunkett the unsung hero of England❤
By throw 4 run is shows the real destiny decided by the lord
Itna bada tournament sirf jada boundaries k dum pe decide ho gya too unfair
One Man Army Stoksyyyyyy😎🇵🇰🩷
In the ashes they lost ben stokes says that they not want this type of win done by wrong method but in wc 2019 he did not say this because it was a major tournament
Ben can do any impossible thing in a cricket match … what a match what a player
BEN STOKES!😍<br>It will declare The Greatest All Rounder of All Time in CRICKET HISTORY🏏
Most legendary match which was held in final match this is cricket 🏏
This is not fair and not a good rule of more boundaries team will win if  <br>Super over tie
How is here in 2023 😈😈😈
Wow 49 million viewers in youtube fifa world cup only below 10 mollion
What a match
Archer overs❤
Cricket won the match...
One of the Best match ever happened on cricket field 🔥
Why was there never a DVD release for this World Cup? The only way to rewatch it is these far too short videos with sound quality issues. What happened?
The most epic 50 Over World Cup Final.
The best one day match I’ve ever seen…maybe the best game ever 🤔
I m speechless how to express my emotion for new zeeland and goosbumps of watching the end!!!
<b>Thanksgiving to England team for the sweet revenge of MS Dhoni&#39;s runout of Semifinals..</b> ❤❤
Ben stokes is english version of yuvraj singh 🇮🇳🇬🇧
OMG 2 balls 3 runs new Zealand bad luck missed easy win 😔
Santner is not try to touch last ball he touched last ball atleast take 1 run I thought they win
Every time watching  this match makes me cry ....Indians deserve this final behalf of kiwis😢😢
new zealand  was away from a few inches
Engkand won the World cup ❤ by Barrisive of Margin Escastic for England Agony For NZ😁😁
And today ben stokes came in odi and YT show this this first video 😂😂
The cricket is very bad!
cheetersssssss england
Because throw was keeper side but stokes bat touched    the ball
England won by cheating
I am repet this match 15 times never  dis ponting
ENGLAND CAN DO ANYTHING FOR WINNING.. SHAME ONE YOU😂
Stokes is hero
This is the one and only match, where you can say that loosing team was not loose.
Fucking hell i love england wowwww
Goosebumps
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉😂😂😂😂❤❤😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
This more boundary rule on which England won the world cup should not be followed. One more super over should be done.
Worst final decision ever in cricket history
Hy dosto
You cheater Icc, actually eng never won that match.
Absolutely This Final 🔥 Was Blasting ⏩⏩🥳
That day my uncle passed away I will never forget that day 🤣🤣🤣🤣
New Zealand were more deserving cuzz those 5runs were biased decision and they selected winner on boundary count what the f**k both team scores equal no one won tbh ...
Fix
Those 5 runs😢
No wonder why does this video attract me whenever i am on Youtube!
The commentary of Ian Smith is just fire 🔥
इंग्लैंड ने बलाई वर्ल्ड कप जीत लिया बट न्यूजीलैंड ने सारे क्रिकेट प्रेमियों का दिल जीत लिया
I was there. I come back to watch this every now and then. It’s just so good
I want to watch this match &amp; listen to the commentary of Ian smith again and again in disbelief 😮🤔 !!!
The greatest thriller match to have ever occured
Boult 🔥
The crowd is so quite
I watched all but one of England&#39;s 6 previous defeats in the final of the World Cup and Champions Trophy.  Several missed opportunities there spanning 40 years plus.  They finally did it 😅
New Zealand very unlucky
I still feel disgusted watching this. Should have been another super over till one team won fairly. England was not the only team to win that day. They don’t deserve to win like this. I hope NZ gets their redemption this year in India.
&quot;Neeshams Six is just insane&quot;❤
Best thriller match in the history of world cup😍😍
Stokes thrives on adversity.
Why not new highlights
❤england❤super🎉batsmen❤and🎉power<br>Full❤batsmen allplayers<br>I❤like❤best team

It was so good
Fir ye bolte hai cheating krta hai
Who played an important role for England to win 2019 worldcup?<br>Ans : Dharmasena 😂
4 years later, as a Kiwi, it still hurts. But despite the controversy, we had the privilege to witness 22 players across 2 teams throwing absolutely everything they had at each other, and as fans, that’s all we could ask for. Truly the most enthralling, dramatic and thoroughly awesome game of cricket ever played.
Newzilend ke Throw se jo 4 run mil gaya thaa England ko yahi karan newzilend ke harne ka
Cheater Strokes......
won off of a draw....

Liam Plunkett is the most underrated in this match
over through runs lost the match
4 years has gone by fast.
BEST MATCH EVER!
No one  match better than this
English cowards cheat this match overthrow 4 the reason for the lost of newzealand
Robbed by england
By the bearest of margins<br>What a choice of words from Will Smith- The commentrator.<br>His commenatary has made this much special &amp; still gives goosebumps.
Galat tha a Newzealand ka world cup
Williamson after win :😀<br>Williamson after lose 😀<br>Who will agree this❤
Those plenty of 5 runs 🙂 whyyy?
Iss saal aus.jeetegi
So Stokes, ECB and the pompous Lord&#39;s, where was the &#39;spirit of cricket&#39; when Stokes did that &#39;thing&#39; for extra four runs? Biggest hypocrites in World Cricket? I think so
This has to be one of the best finals compare to all Australia winnings finals
England will win the World Cup 2023 and will defeat India in India in test series
Game was not won by either side. Only the person who made that rule handed the worldcup to English team
The real stars of this game were the commentators ... Those dudes were outstanding
New Zealanders are the legends
agony for newzealand
প্রতিশোধ হবে ২০২৩ সালের  প্রথম match a eng vs nz 2023 230pm Bangladesh time October 5
Pakistan defeated both these finalists in stage matches 😂🔥
England won the final<br>Newzeland won the hearts ♥️
England V New Zealand 2019 Lords<br>Argentina V France Lusail<br>CSK V GT Ahmedabad<br>The best games ever played in the history
You know match was legendary beacuse even after 4 years...My heart is racing watching highlights!!
Life long goosebumps match
Amazing attack of woakes, archer, wood, rashid and plunkett. What a bowling lineup that is.
Ben stokes obstructing the field and not given out, looks like queen gave the decision
I will tell my kids that 2019 world cup was win by both Nz And Eng
Aaj tak cricket ka aisa final nahi dekha
Super over again
To this day, people underestimate how special this was. Simply one of the most dramatic sporting contests in history. The events throughout were beyond ridiculous at times. Will never happen again so feel blessed if you watched it live.
just imagine if the ball didn&#39;t hit stoke&#39;s bat on the last over... New Zealand would&#39;ve had their first cwc win
best one day cricket match of all time in a world cup final super over you will never see that again
That last words .....England have won the wc with bearest of margin😂😂😂
Had to feel for Kane Williamson. Did everything right for his team to make it to the finals. Very unfortunate lose in the finals.
😊l
I saw 2023 cricket world cup ❤
Weird thing is the hero of England Stokes is originally from newzealand
bowl out method should have been done
Is match me Riyal wineer nrwziland hai💔💔

England ⚡💙💝🥱😊
Worst world cup final ever
Newzealand was the real winner 🏆🗿🥂
Cricket won
Odi cricket at its peak
What a greatest match of cricket history
Accept the fact England never deserved this world cup and i saw more thriller on 23 October 2022 🇮🇳🇳🇿
Biggest scam in the history of cricket
The bat deflection runs were not to be counted according to the laws of cricket. The umire made a mistake
I would like to see White America

Overthrows flying from the bat of stokes was the World Cup for England. Remember kiwis won all hearts
This was the best WC finals ever!! The cricket gods just pulling the strings throughout the match. Stokes six, that unfortunate over throw. Man, this final was crazy!!
14 july 2023 .. exactly 4 years ago
The pure technique - HENRY NICHOLLS
This is the best odi match in cricket history.
Itni takleef 2003 mein nhi huee jitni iss final mein huee thi... Ekdum gully cricket wala rule k hisab se England ko WC bheek mein mil gaya tha
Today 4 years competed

Who is here after 4 years of this match 🙋‍♂️
Four Years To This!!!! (2023)
On this day
In modern cricket 242 runs and tie.... Its mean quality cricket by bat and bowl... ODI cricket is totally cricket and test cricket as well. Love ❤
Nz can&#39;t defeat this stage he was not a four 😂😂😂😂
Newzeeland big mistake in last over
Cricket Commentary peaked here ! <br>Ian Smith 🐐🎙️
Can’t believe this was 4 years ago today!
NZ deserve not Eng 🤧💔
Sab fix tha bc icc bhiki padi hai abki baar india bcz india is venue
Exactly 4 years ago  the biggest robbery in the history of mankind took place today..<br><br>England winning the world cup in such funny way was no less than a robbery.
4 years I hope this world cup its either India or new Zealand
Unlucky absolutely newzeland is unlucky 😢
Any legend watching in 2023 ?
It&#39;s been 4 years just now
If the Super was 15-15  why did England win?
What a game,What a Final<br>Incredible
I couldn&#39;t watch this live kmtt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=287">4:47</a> line was awesome
I&#39;m from India, I&#39;m supporting England for Football and cricket past 15years from my younger age, don&#39;t know y
Cheaters 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=474">7:54</a> That&#39;s KARMA :(
4 years.....Still Goosebumps ✨💥💥<br>What a match!!!!
England badhmashi se 420 team world cup jittha england chitters thoo badakav team benstroke bada 420 badakav
I have watched this match live, but English team won this match by cheating.
We never have this luck in football
Underrated butler
The commentary in the final moments is magical.
They won because of staokes
I watched this pirated while my son was in rehab following leg surgery. I was stressed like hell and my wife told me to go to the gym while we waited for PT to be over. At the gym I could not work out and followed. I went crazy in this snob YMCA in Delaware. I went nuts when they won and no one knew why. This was amazing. And She&#39;s British. I&#39;m just worked there for years. American but fell in love with cricket over the years. It was a good day.
They have rainbows on the stumps now
The Match full of Emotions and Goosebumps.
4 years gone ..But still gives goosebumps
If anyone ever says “I don’t understand sport” this video is one I always bring up.<br><br>BY THE BAREST OF MARGINSSS
What a joke, it was. Newzealand is equally champion. An overthrow made England to tie. Luck
Guys, yes NZ were devastated and didn&#39;t deserve to lose, but they got over it in a handful of days. I haven&#39;t spoken to a single Kiwi who still calls it a robbery. It&#39;s mostly Indians and the odd Australian who still go on about it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=335">5:35</a> remember it was only guptill’s throw which knocked India out in the previous match
Williamson not win the world cup but win millions of heart 😊❤
This is the best final match of the cricket world cup history I belive , there won&#39;t be another masterpiece like this match delivered in the modern cricket world, hats of to both the teams who played till the last gasp
One of the most legendary final match giving goosebumps now also ☺️
Classic. It was on the same time with the Wimbledon final
kiwis are real winners . love from india
ben stokes  cheater sala😂😂
and they say they dont want to win like this
this is just not a highlight..<br>its a lifetime memory of english hypocrisy
If you take usual tie breaker rules in cricket.<br><br>ENG were above NZ by,<br>1. Net run rate<br>2. Number of wins in group stage or overall<br>3. Previous encounter between the two teams which was won by England.<br><br>Even NZ reached Semis just because of net run rate higher than PAK. Even though points were same.<br><br>But since the rule was saying Eng won on boundary count, every idiot who had never held a bat are trolling them and saying that NZ were deserving winners.<br><br>ENG were better and stronger team than NZ in the tournament.
Williamson
Stokes win against his birthplace
I thinking one of the greatest best odi world cup final match ever in the history of cricket game no dowt 👌 but I am happy after India 🇮🇳❤️ my second favourite team is England deserve this team👍☺️
This proves England is the best Cricket team that has ever played.
Here after Ben Stokes said he “wouldn’t want to win a game like that” in the 2nd ashes test…. 😅
I still cannot believe England were declared the winners. New Zealand definitely won this with less wickets lost.
King of wc finals. What a spectacular match it was❤
All fix...<br>Ball bilkull fulltoss thi ...aaram se boundry thi ...but stokes ne player ke haath mei ball daal di ...all scripted
There was big fortune in the side of england.
That extra four run shouldn’t count based on the spirit of cricket. Return the World Cup to NewZealand !!
All time greatest match 👏👏
England robbed New Zealand here and now they&#39;re crying over a stumping 😂😂
England&#39;s pace attack 😮 Woakes,Archer,Plunket,Wood
Nearly 4 years on. What a game! Channel 4 showing it meant I could watch this classic match. It made up for the disappointment of the 1992 Final.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwu1yIC-ssg&amp;t=333">5:33</a> who else watching after the ASHES 2023 BEN Stokes statement
The wrong decision costs New Zealand
Epic match
Ben Stokes forgot about the spirit of the game here 🤣🤣😂😂 because it suited them.
Till date the biggest robbery in Cricket...
Williamson 😊
Ise kehte hain gaddari se jitna England ek gaddar team hai
That&#39;s Fact which team win Semi Final 2 thats team winner of Trophy❤❤❤❤❤
Like 😂 the way ben stokes raised hands up apology. Looked like mission accomplished.
3 years and still get goosebumps
Poor people keep crying.if there was not overthrow stokes went for big one and smash boult out of ground.last ball was full toss.stokes went for double because England not need for maximum that time.
Spirit of the game now English fools?
Thief Ben stokes make the leg bi 4 intentionally...
A kiwi wearing English colours and playing against his countrymen.. no honour!
Cricket world cup 2019&#39;s final and fifa world cup 2022&#39;s final both were thrilling 🤔
Newzeland are the real winners
this has to be the match of a lifetime
Namostu gurudev
Williamson should have come in and faced the super over along with Neesham. Guptill was not in good form in that World Cup
Last two runs needed in 1 ball guptill ran 1 run it should be tie anyone exolain
Worst decision of that overthrow
This match tells us the real meaning of final🎉🎉
The most disgraceful and underserved world cup champions in the history of sports. They became champions because they had hit more boundaries.<br>Unacceptable
Poor new zealand
The most legendary match I was full live match with super over
According to icc rules,<br>If we will run out while going for 2nd<br>Then 1 run will be counted<br>Nz in the last  ball lost their wicket while going for 2nd<br>Then 1 run counts??
Big match player Ben stokes
This was NZ &#39;s world cup ...😂
England cheating<br>1.the ball was intentionally deflected from the bat by stokes during overthrow and went to boundary. Those runs should be cancelled<br>2. Both the teams are level even after the super over so it is a tie
I hate cricket but this was mental, so much im back here rewatching it 4 years later 😅
it&#39;s like a movie, no one will believe this happened in 200,300 years 😀if this is not recorded
Karma for dhoni run out to new Zealand
Newzealand winner 2019 world cup
It is best world cup final
