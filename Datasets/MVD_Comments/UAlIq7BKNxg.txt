Wish PewDiePie returned to gaming
Back in 2023 cause of random nostalgia

Nice Song.
Can&#39;t believe its been 3 years i wish. I had my old acc back
Just found out today that pewds is taking a break for a while because he is becoming a dad soon. So I started watching the minecraft series again and as someone who has watched him for years, I get emotional seeing the man he has become. I am so proud to call myself a fan of his 🥰😭
Diamonds are no longer found at Y=12 :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=52">0:52</a>

Three years later and still coming back to it. A banger for sure.
I, too, mine all day

i started watching this in loops at 2020 and im still watching this until  i find diamonds
If YouTube doesn&#39;t work out for him he could a rapper
fun fact: in this song, when PewDiePie starts rapping, in a scene you can catch a glimpse of the colored houses that he was at where he recorded the song &#39;Congratulations&#39;.
I mine your house I mine your mom

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=233">3:53</a> i love that die bitch
Alternate title: 30 year old man sings a song for a 13 year old game for 4 minutes stright
Funfact: you can sing &quot;Bitch Lasagna&quot; lyrics on &quot;Fully Stacked Diamond&quot; part
This brings back so many pre-Pandemic Memories.
Bro i did not realize the production was so good on this song
Who&#39;s watching in 1080p
roblox
Now I&#39;ve realised, we need a netherite song
What the<br>It s been 3 years already Mann
The music hits me everytime
This is insane
epic
I can&#39;t believe this was 3 years ago 🥸
Can&#39;t believe this is the first time I am hearing this song.
As someone who grew up on minecraft song parodies and PewDiePie, seeing this brings a tear to my eye. Young me would be absolutely flabbergasted that PewDiePie would sometime make a MC song, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d believe myself 😅.
its so bad u should quit whiteboy, and stay outta japan
Bro I don’t realize the Kanye West reference until just now 💀
Uploaded on my birthday. Best birthday present I got.
“I mine your mom” broke me
Miss This era
why is a 30 year old man  singing about a 10+ year old game that is made for kids is he a pedo or something
WATCHIGN AGAIN AFTER 3YEARS
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 3 years.. time flies.
still hits hard
I mine your mom :D
so happy felix allowed pewdiepie to feature in the song
Born in right generation !
So much nostalgia rn 😢
other rappers: flex money, girls and Bugatti&#39;s <br> chad Pewds: flexes minecraft diamonds
i really REALLY miss this...
Bruh this song is unironically fire asf
Man I feel old, the Minecraft series was 3 years ago.
Man this was such an interesting time in YouTube gaming history.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=39">0:39</a>
Ayyy Anniversary
3 year anniversary!!
Yung lean
&quot;I mine your mom&quot;
how has it been two years 😭
Sometimes I wish if I can like a video a 1000 times over 💖

❤
3 years later this shit actually goes hard as fuck ngl
Cool
omg i remeber this
Ima mine all day and night after this 😂
I can listen to this all day
Still a banger in 2022
p
Minors all day
I love this song, and Im so glad because it would have ruined it for me if the man who wrote these lyrics did anything terrible, glad that never happened and never will :)
I&#39;m soo suprised this song dosent have more viewes, its freaking lit
“I mine your mom i-“ Felix that’s a bit sus!🤨
My childhood 😭😭😭
Back when diamonds where at Y=12😞
i love how this is actually gas asf
song is gonna be 3 years old this month... it still slaps
Mark that this el video is 3 years old.<br>Feeling old yet<br><br><br><br><br><br>Goofy ahh comment made cringe on purpouuse
Been a while since i&#39;ve seen this
I hate the fact that Pewds Minecraft series was years ago
this song may have aged well but the lyricist’s love interests haven’t
Second part of the song started a moshpit of minecraft ragers
Hottest song of the century
This went from humble and a vibe to cringe pointless ego stroking flexing real quick.
First it was a Minecraft song, now it&#39;s minecraft rap
It&#39;s so weird that he once said that he hated Minecraft in 2015 (I think) and people us to use that to validate that Minecraft sucks,as a kid who hasn&#39;t stopped playing the game when it was presumed &quot;dead&quot;,it was one of the man reasons why I kinda hated him at that time and the controversies he had in the past make my image of him even worse,the fact that he played Minecraft again cuz of it being 10 years old when players like me hoped on the game after years of not playing and it that fact that he was doing gaming week at that time was unreal ngl, mid 2018 I started watching him and stated watching more vids since he was a much better person than I thought so my respect towards him grew more when realizing that he made a mistake and took accountability,I would have been happy that he played the game once but the an other upload came and than another to now making it one of his favorite games ever made,it made me realize that people can change their opinion on anything which can be good or bad depending on the topic at hand(if your still reading this you might be asking why I writing this stupidly long comment,well the truth is that I&#39;m procrastinating rn so SHUUUSH,you guys are pretty cool for reading this ngl)
I remember the hour  it came out I was vibin to this in the shower💀💀
master piece
Creeper
Yoooooooooo
THIS IS WHERE IT CAME FROMMM
I mine your mum
i miss the old days.
he is still fully stacked diamonds to this day

So under-rated
I can&#39;t believe it was 2 years ago, it feels like yesterday, yet it was a long time ago

Pewdiepie making a minecraft song with a video is insane
you cant sleep in the nether
Why does the second part hit so hard😩
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=120">2:00</a>
I forgot about this song let&#39;s goo
I think this is my favorite song from Pewds, something about the transition from game to real life that&#39;s so satisfying
how is he sleeping in the nether
Väldigt bra felix
I&#39;ve been listening to Pewds singing recently and it made me realize I want more songs, doesnt even have to ba a diss song lol
Finally is blue
Why is yellow tears is that pee

Who else can hear the tune of bitch lasagne in the &quot;fully stacked diamonds&quot; part...
طلعت اغنية هنودي مسروقه من بيودي باي لول XD
dam good
Soooo... I as mining for diamonds listening to this, and exactly when the chorus hit, I found diamonds.<br>This song is my new luck song.
Imagine this video being taken down
the worst shit I have ever heard
Subscriber to PEWDIEPIE
the ending (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=180">3:00</a> on) sounds strangely like bitch lasagna...
1. Bitch Lasagna<br>2. Congratulations<br>3. Mine all Day<br>4. Coco<br>Which is your favorite?
The last part gave me chicken skin...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=199">3:19</a> BIG SLAP
Coolest rap ever
So nostalgiac
This must have been really fun to film
“There’s nothing deeper than me”<br>Me: that’s deep bro
GAMER
I can came back bad sadly technoblade died<br>Rip technoblade
This song is catchy as fokk!

Pewdeipei don’t sleep in the nether <br><br><br>Pewdeipei don’t go under water to long all you will die in mindcraft<br><br><br><br>Pewdeipei don’t use all your diamonds on armor or tools because it will wasted it all

急に聞きたくなる音楽w
im fully stacked netherite

Soon. It’s gonna be 3 years

I just realized when he said, &quot;i got iron (in my house)&quot; <br> he meant weights cause he&#39;s pumping iron 100% muscle increase
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=162">2:42</a> عربي هلو المهم هاي بمنو تذكركم<br><br><br><br><br><br>لني انا اوسم لني انا اوسم  تدسني يجيك الرد لني انا أوسم

💥💥💥
This video&#39;s CGI is better than minecraft: Story mode.
Can’t believe it’s been 2 years already<br>Ngl this music makes me emotional now 🥲 ❤️
i love pewdiepie brofist
copyriht?
Imagine being a passer by and seeing 3 grown men going crazy with minecraft tools in the middle of the night. 😂
Everytime i watch this, i keep remembering those times when i was rewlly obsesses with PewDiePie. Its nostalgic really
2 years ago.. woah
King
It&#39;s been 2 years daddy
Ngl At the end of 10 years this will be very nostalgic
this hits harder than the warden
Pewdiepie: <b>mines mom</b><br>Me: <b>has no proper mother figure</b><br>Me just accepting it
Bet you cant fill this out: Creeper...
Bg giv alak
&quot;You’re so dumb you mine diamond with a stone pickhax&quot; <br>Well both Jack and mark actually did this (granted, for jack, he thought he was using an iron one)
This song hit so hard! especially the instrumental!
Finally, a Minecraft animation song that isn&#39;t cringe
first part of song is his normal survival second part of song is his hardcore industrial revolution
Second part hits hard, I hope he will make any new song soon🙂
Straight certified original supermegagigachad banger.
cool, check my minecraft star wars builts in my page.
Nostalgia really hits different..
The melody and flow of the first half are unmatched. The second half destroys you lyrically
Bangin in 2022
I when you say bitch
all ways fire😁
How about netherite?
&quot;i got the biggest ball the world has ever seen&quot;<br>Lol
:0
The effects at the end were really neat
SO NOSTALGIC ITS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY I FIRST HEARD THIS
33 mil gg
Still im happy that i was alive to see all this
this cool song but why is it copyrighted?
Hello from 2022
He’s using such a realistic texture pack at the end
Good
May 30, 2022
Anyone listening in 2022?
plot twist: minecraft added the new deepslate caves because pewdiepie said there&#39;s nothing deeper than him
Mine all life...
2years ago nake me old
This cool music
90% of people here don&#39;t even play minecraft lmao
&quot;I&#39;m a y 12 baby cuz that&#39;s were its found&quot; wow this song is old but still good. Like minecraft.
so much better than commercial music vids. this one deserved as many views as bitch lasagna
The transcript doesnt understand anything he is saying
Whoooo epic gamers music
OG
“ILL MINE UR MOM” 🤣
Decided to watch jacksepticeye&#39;s playthrough of minecraft. In his episode, just weeks before this came out, he mines a diamond block with a stone pick axe. Then this song started playing in my head. Savage pewds.
you die in minecraft you die in real life
dude really enchanted the iron pickaxe with fortune
yes
Wow
This song still hits hard, it will just never get old
Still here for the best song guys
creeper, aw man<br><br><br><br><br><br>yes i love the beginning
I know this was a long time ago, but Pewdiepie has a talent for singing should devote himself more to singing or making music more often. don&#39;t judge my spelling I&#39;m Latin just use a translator
Pewdipie is the best thing that happened to Minecraft. I feel so bad cuz YouTube be taking down his music. 😭 Papa poods is my living legend.
we need a new updated remix to fully stacked diamonds since the new update allows us to go deeper now XD
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 2 years dude.
hes inspired so many to follow there dreams ty pewds
&quot;Dont mine at night&quot;: finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!.
This song will never get old.
19 мая 2022 год <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=1316">21:56</a>

Freaking iam under ground
Man I miss the series
Its almost been 3 years. I still remember when it came out
I can&#39;t believe this is already 2 years old💀
Me, who plays mc weekly, subbed to PewDiePie for couple years, and didn&#39;t even heard about this song.
can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 2 years
I keep coming back to this ❤️
Cool song

:o
I don&#39;t need it..... I dOn&#39;T nEeD iT............ I DON&#39;T NEED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I NEEEEEED ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jack in the background is for some reason strange
he needs to start a genuine music career
son are you still here :)
Yes
its still hilarious that this came out just as netherite was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=200">3:20</a> This is my favourite part
drain
mine all day words of a legend
Bring back the badass Pewds!, still loving him today
This is your last good days in minecraft because soon a stickman called King orange will destroy everything along with two minecraft cubes and 5 stickman won&#39;t be able to stop him<br>edit: of course for those who don&#39;t know jokes Alan becker
Who ever animated the Wolves should animate more wolves
why did he say fortune 5?
i see jacksepticeye
Creepa aww man
2 songs in one vid? now that&#39;s a bargain
feels like yeasterday;(
Cant wait to get nostalgic
Is anyone still here?
2 years ago and it still has absolutely no right to go that hard
Lol he passed lapis but you need lapis to enchant don&#39;t know if the update came out when he made this lol
Right as the beat dropped my minecraft game froze and I lost like 40 min of progress 🙃
I wake up early in the morning listening to this song
When i was too young to understand the line “I mine your mom🎶”
Straight bars at the end
&quot;Remember kids life isnt fair take from the second minecraft multi millionaire&quot;  RIGHT THERE SAVAGE
PewDiePie all day
Literally the first song i listen to everymorning when i was grade 6
Amm good bro
Mans dose not make music a lot but when he dose he delivers hard
He better than Skydoesminecraft
God this is better than any modern rap song lmao
170th?
THE BEST SONG
This is why he takes breaks
this song hits harder than pewds diamond pickaxe
Who&#39;s still here in 2022??
trash
<b>I got millions</b><br><i>in real life</i>
This PewDiePie&#39;s Mine all Day feels so good like everything that happens in his Series!
I mine all day !
2022
I’m a gamer too :3
I cant even tell how high quality the audio is... The bass straight from YouTube already pumping up my chest
the villager is very cute and realistic
Amazing
Mine all things
this takes me back to when my life was happy, not an exam to worry about, no job to take up time and the biggest stress was getting caught with your phone at night. life was just good.
&quot;i mine your mom&quot;
Imagine Felix&#39;s kids sitting in their couch listening to this on speaker while Felix is in the room. I bet he&#39;d cringe
I love among us
“Y 12 cause that’s where it’s found”<br>     Sorry pewds buuutt umm
I love this very much
WAW
&quot;I mine your mom&quot;
<i>&quot;I&#39;ll mine old gay&quot;</i>
PEWDIERPIE MINECRFAFT SONG PWEWDIEP[IE
Still relevant 2022!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=197">3:17</a>
holy shit its been 2 and a half years since pewdiepie made this and over 3 since he started the series<br>lockdown was just hyperspeed

I refuse to believe this was released 4 years ago
still couldn&#39;t defeat t series
Please tell me I’m not here alone in 2022 😩
W
So Roomie I get, he probably made the beat, but I admit to being a little confused as to why Jack was there.
Mods when you enter a discord server:
I got millions (in real life) got me in tears...
This was 2 years ago...
the bedrock part is actually fire
Minecraft is good until Dream makes one
ok, he frickin rappin
gli italiani capiscono l&#39;inglese ma gli inglesi capiscono l&#39;italiano??😺😺
Ayo this fucking slaps unironically
Part 1: <b>when you build a dirt house and can barely survive night</b><br><br>Part 2: <b>When you got a mansion, full enchanted netherite items and kill withers because you’re bored</b>
Song still slaps
Still love this song💜💜💜
godd
PewDiePie should make a music channel and upload those videos there.
Numbera trap there are infinite
why i actually be getting hyped to this shit bruh

U might have diamonds but.. I have netherite haha
This is Fire, that&#39;s all I got to say.. <br><br>(Edit!!) Wait wait wait. Does any one remember when Mark mined diamonds with a stone pickaxe? 0-0 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=203">3:23</a><br><br>lol

Pewds: Fully stacked diamonds<br>Skeppy: I am diamond
„You so dumb you mining diamonds with a stone pickaxe“ <br>Jack sweating nervously
so many people come back to this song everyday, this song is legendary!
Petition for a remake, its been 2 years there&#39;s a lot of change happened
Your mom
Anyone British can read this Ye kara hai to
HOW he slept in the nether
DAAAAAMMM
dam this is fire how did i miss this?
‘i mine your mom’
legends still coming here.
i mine your mom
Pewdiepie kinda sounds like a hoarder in this one lol.
Dang this was 2 years ago
OMF I WORKED OUT TO THIS SONG BEFORE- I think I heard this in a workout video before lool
Never get old!!!!!!!!!!!
&quot;There is nothing deeper than me&quot; 12 year old kids on CoD when they lose: are you sure about that?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=39">0:39</a> wow! PEWDIEPIE GOOD SINGING
I love
I still can’t believe it was uploaded 2 years ago
Lengend still alive till now
Watching this 2 years later, i realize the big character arch of pewdiepie. This song is way too underrated and needs to be view by more people.
him: i want that blue stuff, me: ok heres lapis
I love this music
How was this uploaded 2 years ago?<br>Didn&#39;t he start his minecraft let&#39;s play <br>Like 5 months ago?
The Guy who revived Minecraft
For 3 years of hearing this song right now at this very moment I found Sean (Jacksepticeye) in the part where he is like &quot;bitch shut the fuck up have a you seen my diamond stack&quot;
Who&#39;s gonna tell him about the netherites?
Qué temazo coño
Subscribe to PewDiePie<br>All of you on earth sub to Pewds
I used to play this song on repeat for so long
Never seen nostalgia hit so early 😩😩😩
I remember listening to this so much during the online classes of 2020 lol
who&#39;s here
good music
wait what the hell? 2 years ago?? i thought it came out some months ago..
I&#39;m honored that this was part of my childhood
2 years?
Pewds could legit start a music career
Minecraft New Herobrine - pewdiepie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=61">1:01</a> Ah yes, i like mining my mom.
last
Last
Last
After I watched this it felt like Pewds was still doing Minecraft letsplays...
nice
this song is literally 3 years old now. it&#39;s felt like this was made 4 months ago. wow..
The beat is actually sick. If pewds became a full time artist i would be all for it. Like this definitely shows great potential. Call the group the diamond lasagna.
the feeling i get when i build my best house
can&#39;t belive this came out 2 years ago man time really flies by ;)
Hii
2 years ago? Damn how
@BoldBlakeyBoy this u?
still slaps 😩✨
Feels like literally yesterday this came out. Actually it feels like just yesterday that PewDiePie vs T Series was a thing. Time goes by so fast....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=137">2:17</a> :)
MINCRAFT PLAYS WHO STILL HERE WE&#39;VE BEEN HERE OWWW MAN
😡 I can blame and why did you make this song I already have a song and it&#39;s better than yours
This was 2 years ago?!
im so old wtf
Best
nice
It would be nice if he would do some of his great beatboxing in his songs.
Its So Weird PewDiePie
😁
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=61">1:01</a> &quot;mine your mom&quot; lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=51">0:51</a> the relatable reaction when he seems so disappointed to find the lapis lazuli instead of diamond...
In 7 years this will be nostalgic as hell.
sir we hit bedrock....
simpler times
Nostalgic af
pib dave and pewds is a dream team change my mind.
Drip
This shouldn’t be this good
Your
are the 9 yos still watching this in 2022?
This is a masterpiece
This song randomly just popped in my head after 2 years so here I am I guess…
Best song i have heard love from india❤️ brofistarmy is best

Yo
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=203">3:23</a>) when markiplier mined diamonds with a stone pickaxe LUL  <br><br><br>(not saying thats what that part was about just thought that was funny. mark smol brain no six pack big brain. no hate)
What do you say to your crush..?<br><br><br>You&#39;re mine all day 😏

Please 👆 👆 👆 Pleaseee 🥺
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlIq7BKNxg&amp;t=76">1:16</a> I about choked to death. 🤣
Good song💗
This song brings back memories of me not even knowing how to get Cobblestone
fully stack diamoand
He did not need to go that hard for a minecraft song damn
1.18 aged this song
Can we just take a moment to say F for the Editor That put in so much and still managed to make it work
I love 💕 you song nice Minecraft song 🧡♥️💛🧡💜🧡💜♥️🧡♥️
First part givin me serious 2013 vibes
Is it bad that this makes me tear up inside?
CaptainSparklez started the Aww man..<br><br>Pewds brought it to a close
The latest minecraft shades have been so good that the last part almost seems real
2 years ago?... what the fuck covid?!<br>Also I just realized the quality is much better than I remember
This song is better than Fresh Outta London
I was there when Gaming Week happened
We&#39;ll all look back on this in a few years, knowing well that Pewdiepie and other creators brought the resurgence of Minecraft. May this game never die!
cool song
I am full stock enchanted  netherite lol<br>Now I am better that you
Why is this hard 😭😭😭
2 years, DANG
I love this song
&quot;y12 cos that&#39;s where it&#39;s found&quot;<br>Mojang got him
Cool
We hit bedrock it means we cant go any deeper Villager ha
This is really a sad song in disguise
you see jack in the background vibin
Fully stacked diamonds, you wont see me crying:<br><br><br>netherite: Allow us to introduce ourselfs.
Pewds definitely blew my mind with his quality of work on his songs. I still beat this shit UN-IRONICALLY
i am not satisfied by this😐🤨😶😑....
I MINE YOUR MOM
Sir you hit bedrock!<br>Add new update
I cant believe this video is 3 years old now
I refuse to believe this is 2 years ago
The song has become outdated. People are now looking for Netherite, and now we can go deeper than bedrock
Nostalgia dude
Markiplier mined a diamond with stone ⛏️
This is now underatted
THIS WAS TWO YEAS AGO
I REMEMBER THIS OMG
Nice 👍
Why do you get a lot of likes if you comment Repost Network Sucks
He did NOT have to go this fuckin hard😂
this is fr hard hhahah
this inspired sicko mode
ah yoo i saw sean(jacksepticeye if u dont know his real name) and shit went lit
This was back when minecraft wasn&#39;t infected with dream stans and toxic people.<br>I want these days back
Its a shame that pewds cant even his song. Because of some idiots and yt&#39;s shitty system.
No dislikes?
YOUTUBE PLEASE STOP THIS MUSIC CLAM BULLSHIT REPOST NETWORK IS A FUCKING SCAM!
Banger
Now every time some one sees a creeper they&#39;re like :awww man <br>😂😂
Nostalgic
still slaps bebeeeee
Apparently this got claimed
Lesssssss goooooo!
Who ?
ye
YouTube needs to fix there copyright system  what if this happened to smaller Youtubers and they can&#39;t get someone from YouTube to fix it
this is like the modern day “Revenge”
The copyright is gone LMAO
I swear I felt like this song came out like yesterday and I had been banging to it all day, <i>how fast time flies</i>
“Remember kids life isn’t fair<br>Take it from the second Swedish Minecraft multimillionaire”<br>That’s the biggest and hardest flex ever 😂 that line is iconic
False copyright claims really pisses me off even my original videos got copyright claimed
F*ck, YouTube is degrading. Honestly hoping that there would be a time when people suddenly drop it just for a day, just to make them see how serious we are.
I need to stop coming back here it&#39;s unhealthy at this point-
This is Mine All Day and Fully Stacked Diamond at once
y12 is no longer where it is found :(
Finally RepostN*twork is gone
went to see the bogus claim for myself, guess youtube is good at one thing, if that may b fixing their shit when its shoved at them.
&quot;I am at, y level 12 coz its where its found&quot; this sentence is not relatable now
Record labels should fall, they do nothing but ruin, and Fuck peoples lives over
He mean 110m people agree
well i have fully stacked netheright
At this point, YouTube “Claimed this music” video and could take down someone video if this use this song. God, I fucken hate YouTube after they deleted Coco distract! PewDiePie, do more music don’t let YouTube say to you!
where is the copyright? is it removed?
May those who in RepostNetwork claimed this masterpiece, die a tragic death.
lmao pewds video has a copyright claim from felix kjelberg
How can company claim someone else video and then creator can&#39;t even do anything<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This is just sad
Fck repost network
Im 14 and this is deep
Fck RepostNetwork
STOP WATCHING THIS IT WILL MAKE A FAKE COMPANY THAT COPYRIGHT CLAIMED IT MAKE MONNEY
YouTube in 2021: F*ck you! You can&#39;t use your own video/music.
The fact that the link to the song in the &quot;Music in this video&quot; section, brings us to some random lyrics video that a kid made of this song , shame on you YouTube for giving incorrect copyright licence to some random company
I love how someone copyrighted Pewd&#39;s own video and saying that its Pewd&#39;s video.. lmao
Repost network, which name seriously sounds suspicious, youtube should look it up its not even sounds like a company name
How in the fuck did a company claimed a song belong to someone else?wtf is this crap youtube
That&#39;s like the copyright troll they showed in Silicon Valley. I am still trying to wrap my head around this repost network thing.
Just came here to say fuck RepostNetwork. Don&#39;t listen to this song so they can&#39;t get revenue!
RepostNetwork is a bad company
