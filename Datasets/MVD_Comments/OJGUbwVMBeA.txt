I have faith and believe gay people can go to heaven. Imo the Bible is NOT God&#39;s word it&#39;s man&#39;s interpretation of God&#39;s word. Never be ashamed of being gay their is nothing wrong with it. Stay true to yourself have true faith if you can and God bless you 🙏❤️ im also the kind of person to tell you to go f yourself if you have a problem with my take

I love this song so much. This song is the reason I became a Demi Lovato fan in first place. Actually, there were a lot of songs that made me into a Demi Lovato fan
For Matthew broomhall 😂

Love thos song. STILL love her album pose. Beautiful album too. Every song on then album
when i was in junior high I was bullied so much and it was the same year that this some came out. idk but it makes me trust myself and believe that there was nothing wrong w/ me (I was discovering my sexuality at this point) and demi helps just with a song, just like gaga with born this way. I&#39;m so grateful for you and all the pop artists that REALLY supports us, the lgbtq+ community

Eu não escuto muito a Demi Lovato
Eu gostava dessa música quero mais nova agora não gosto tanto
‭‭Romans‬ ‭<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA&amp;t=86">1:26</a>‭-‬28‬ ‭ESV‬‬<br><br>[26] For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; <br>[27] and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. <br>[28] And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.
This is my new fav song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
you dont like god  what youre doing here you dont deserve be alive
It&#39;s very good
So happy to have someone like Demi actively participate in the community, even now in 2024! ❤
Demi tried to cash in on a movement and quickly turned around and ran the other way when she realized what a train wreak it is.
❤❤
R-i-d-í-c-u-l-a! 😢
Demi best player
Still listening this masterpiece in 2023 and will be listening in 2024... Proud of my queen Cher, also Demi was my diva hero 🥺😍❤️
I like this song because it helps me. Because I got used to hiding my sexuality for knowing if I am bisexual or not. Because it isn&#39;t appropriate for a 3 year old to know how to become a bisexual. That&#39;s why ever since I was 3 years old I had a hard time growing up with this injustice that my dad is spreading hate like this I don&#39;t like him for saying, &quot; it&#39;s against our religion&quot;. That&#39;s why I had a hard time for finding acceptance for my sexuality from my childhood. For along time ever since my whole childhood my dad never liked me to come out who I really am but It wasn&#39;t really my choice. That&#39;s why I got used to hiding my sexuality from him because he thinks that it&#39;s against our religion.That&#39;s why I suffered from this injustice from my childhood until adulthood.
demi slaaaaay

I’m giving this song 100% I know LGBTQ+ we really need how to give those people to make a life experience and it gives them <br>the official foundation to raise money for LGBTQ+ take my advice let’s find a foundation for LGBTQ+ to help them.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23vevo">#VEVO</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lgbtq">#LGBTQ</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23vevopop">#VEVOPop</a>
This is one of her best songs. I have to admit it!<br>With each new drop, Demi Lovato consistently amazes us with her musical prowess, consistently presenting Authentic views as the crucible for unbridled talent, resonating throughout the rhythmic cultural terrain. It serves as the true epicenter where artists forge their paths to greatness. My girl skillfully harnessed its power.
Honestly i just miss when you made music just because 😢

Originally this started out as a breakup song, but then I realized I&#39;m in such an awesome place that I don&#39;t really want it to have a negative messsage - Demi Lovato<br>An awesome song that will never get old!!!

Bro 😩💔 the first 10 seconds are like a stab in my heart 🤧 But lemme tell you something, Jesus ain&#39;t dead, he&#39;s coming back alive 🙏🏽 And those people ain&#39;t bullying, they just warning you for his return. ✝️
this deserves 1B
The verses sound like the &quot;I drove my car into a bridge&quot; song and the pre-chorus has shades of&quot;Shadows of the Night &quot;, but guess what? I really don&#39;t care! I like the song anyway
I would care about palatinate more than motherfuckers <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23support_claytown">#support_claytown</a> 😢

Really don&#39;t care mi adolescencia 11 a 13 años for 20 años
INSUPPRESSIBLE<br>// <br>On June 18th 2023 in Jerusalem Israel, I was hit by a 90 mile per hour bus. I did not die after I was hit. I am a triumpher.<br>// <br>The bus that hit me shattered my left <br>collarbone, but not my resiliency. I am greatness and excellence personified. <br>// <br>Do not give up when doubters and haters reject who we are. Annihilate adversity and losses with courage and fortitude. <br>// <br>Overcoming obstacles and setbacks is what I do best. I know I am a all time great. I know how to silence my critics. <br>// <br>Hope love and courage are the <br>major virtues I live my life with. <br>After I was hit, I stood up again. <br>// <br>I value and celebrate the present moments of my life even more<br>than the past. Seize the present.<br>// <br>When it will come my time to die, <br>I will die as a real hero to my family <br>and with love in me. I am valuable. <br>// <br>The time is now to make a difference  and fight for what matters to our global human race. Evil cannot exterminate us.<br>// <br>Whenever negative life experiences <br>hammer us with the same force as <br>buses, respond through toughness. <br>// <br>Greatness excellence success victory and redemption can only be achieved <br>with fortitude. Never give up. Just win. <br>Mrs Demi Lutes Lovato, I am real. Signed your biggest fan in Israel, 29 years old, Jonathan Trauner. EGOT win here I come in 2028.

I love this song. This is my 3rd favourite song after Cool for the summer and Heart attack.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA&amp;t=158">2:38</a>
Dont care what is wrong.. its big mistakes.
Too bad us want equality to a bunch of phycos making demands and praying on children 😔 alot of real gays are disgusted to be gay right now because of the bullshit...
Even thought I&#39;m a metal guy, I kind if like this song. It&#39;s got some aggression and attitude. Plus I was at that pride parade and if I saw myself and my face was blurred, I would be sad.
Favorite song ❤

When I came out as gay 30years ago i had a hard difficult time being accepted particularly by church people who professed at being my friends and also family members who i loved so dearly at the time😢😢😢 unfortunately 30 years later i am estranged from my family and left the church after being a member since i was a young 14year old teenager i am not certain i could ever reconcile with my immediate family nor my church family😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

Love this song. ❤️❤️

Hi
No offense to people but this video is very disturbing😢
How could I never noticed that Travis Barker was behind with the drums... And it came like 10 years ago
i like it a lot omg
Next Rock Version...please 🙏
cher Lloyd have the same bday as me
The only thing in the video that I would change is perez hilton and wilmer lol
Maître Gims je suis déjà ta « fan », il y a plusieurs années. Whosever idea this collaboration was - you’re genius! I’d love to hear the story of how you all came together. Armenian, French and English 🎶 Mi gna 💜 I listen to you guys at least once a day 💜
I love this song so much.She just so proud. I’m happy &amp; love proud to be part of the LGBTQ. She just great singer and person.
I’m Christian so I’m often labeled as a homophobe but the Christians who hate and make lgbt people feel like sh*t for loving who they want really piss me off
NO NON O THIS IS TRASH
People are sad 😪 after everything jesus did for you.......😢 ppl still do this
I would talk I would talk but even if the stars and moon collide I never want u back into my life oh oh oh I really don care love that part
This song helped me through Highschool bc fuck bullies nobody deserves hates js be yourself fuck wha they think or say 🙄🖕🏽
Cherr 😍😍😍😍😍
Very good song I  really don’t care
OK how do I erase stuff out of my brain
Seems like a nice woman.  I think her music is crap.  Sorry.
Just realizing Travis Barker was on drums, no wonder I love this so much.
Still best :))
After 9 years this song is a trend 😊
I miss the early and mid 2010&#39;s gay vibes.
When she says care got me like 😐
🦬
When i was 4 i saw this music video and didnt really know what it was about , but i LOVED this song so i took my dads phone and sang the song .Sang my 4 year old heart out.
Muito sucesso meu amor 💗💗💗💗
Mulher que incrível ♥️✨
This song just popped in my head out of here omg , what a throwback
The preachers were not spreading hate they are spreading guidance, btw you can’t spell lgbtq without an L! 🙏
WTF 🤨why does this video have alot of views
She&#39;s straight and she got a boyfriend and she stills support LGBT rights, she&#39;s awesome 😎
I support LGBT rights too and I don&#39;t like people who intolerant and racist either and some straight people is kinda mean and selfish against other people rights too
as much as im not i to the same sex i do like this
🤪😵‍💫🫶🎶💃🎉🥰🎶🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🎛🖥

Together, we can kill the despot, the warmonger, the bigot, the Father, YHWH and his bastard son
O mudinho sujo
بجد مصدومه بقالي سنتين بسمعها واول مره اعرف انها لبتوع الرينبو
Oh oh oh i really don&#39;t care<br>❤😂
We need this Fun and brightful Demi again
Rip gender
He does love all. But not all are saved
Happy pride, lovatics!
💖💗💝😘😍🐰🐼
parece mentira amo y amaba esta cancion cuando salio hace 8 años,ver este tipo de videos en ese tiempo era muy raro :3
I used to have beautiful German Australian woman hips and a prettier face then you
That intro is what we all need to hear sometimes especially in times like now. For so long I doubted myself for nothing, there is no other option but to live our lives to the fullest and show that we are no different and are just living our best life. Now my best friend who is straight says you just live your best life and I will support you and celebrate love together.
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH
There are two GENDERS that’s a fact not an opinion ✅
Ok. I&#39;m a Christian and all i wanna say is we  don&#39;t care what ur sexuality is. Just don&#39;t shove it down our throats. We fr dgaf abt ur sexuality. Also God loves all anyway. Thats all i have to say. God Bless yall.
Just because people play Hogwarts Legacy, LGBT harass people, so why can&#39;t LGBT find out and klii the author harry potter, why harass others
I really don&#39;t care too girl and boys are losers and girls are popular like even though they look cool they&#39;re not cool. I love girls, no boys but girls are the best like they could do cartwheels and boys king. They just do it wrong. I hate it because if he comes in my life I will pump to him in his face. I will talk. I will talk and I don&#39;t want you in my life or like get all my life
LOVE THE SONG!❤
My class mates are like &quot;OMG he&#39;s/she&#39;s gay OMG&quot; like if they&#39;re gay it&#39;s not a problem it&#39;s they&#39;re choice
U didn’t care so much u wrote a song about it

I LOVE THIS VIDEO &lt;3
I want to repost it but it won’t let me use this sound

Bro really got me smashing the piano to play this song 😂😂😭😭😭
2023 😢
I came here becouse of tiktok😂
Love this song
I really respectfully must disagree because you really do see me much the same way and the evidence is your obvious oh well so what Mike  has came from such  a long very difficult journey and come on don&#39;t you dare treat me like I&#39;m stupid or don&#39;t know exactly your true feelings and inner motivation so your defense mechanism clearly is to haunt the living crap out of me and this is why I simply felt well damn talk about having the most difficult task for last this is a very much a understatement. If you actually didn&#39;t give A shit about me what so ever then we already would have had the necessary conversations that obviously are mutually needed and since I was the guilty one I had to wait til you initiated our very long overdue talk that even if this won&#39;t ever put myself back into your life at least there be closure knowing that I am going to try to at least make some amends. I don&#39;t at all ever think you just express we are good Mike. But please ask yourself why have you truly been lurking in the shadows watching me for??? Yes I am very skilled just like yourself except I have the blessing to read ppl real feelings even on occasion thoughts so just be real about our stuff so together we Can find a way to move into this new Era on such better terms than either of us could ever guess until we both act like the mature adults we both are ok I know how more than accomplished you truly are and I do know how damn incredibly hard you have busted your ass overcoming so much stuff so I can&#39;t ever ask you to let me into your life but I have to take this very blessed opportunity to try to somehow make the best efforts I can to show you how very much that period also has really messed with myself so why are you this closed off unless you never believed how very haunted this has lingered with myself
8 June 2023 I love this song so much 😊
i love demi lovato but this just seems wrong
I love this song so much❤❤❤❤❤
Also I like the song but not the vid
G-d made a boy and a girl not a boy and a boy or a girl and a girl so this is disrespecting g-d and it is not appropriate for kids
Kinda like me and my friend she was breaking up with someone but she couldn’t get her words out. So I just screamed at them . I did get detion but she’s happy now

Demi, I really love this song by you and Cher Lloyd. The beats really catchy, and I now love the music video a lot, you two, go!
Tan linda y dañada para apoyar a esa gente que deprava y daña la sociedad.😢
This was a song for a Barbie fashion game I would play as a kid. ❤😂 I love this song sm

LGBT destroy morality
Happy Pride 2023❤🎉
She let her feelings out i love this  song
Loving everyone means wanting everyone to obey the Eternal, abandon their sins and be born again, so that they can have eternal life.LGBTQIA+ practices are a sin.
I don’t support lgbtq+ but I love how happy they are. RESPECT EVERYONE!
Sodom and Gomorrah
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA&amp;t=105">1:45</a> WHY?
B
I see the Romans 1:18 sign but I&#39;m pretty sure they didn&#39;t read chapter to which talks about judging one another is also a great sin they are such hypocrites. Those who condemn others only condemn themselves
Now this is my favorite Demi Lovato song and I will definitely listen to this song in pride month🏳️‍🌈<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23love">#Love</a> is love
The fuck 😂. This song promote LGBT 😅
Gay is a sin 💀
I LOVE REALLY DONT CARE

Our lord says love everyone, it does not say we must agree with what you stand for. It also does not change the fact that you are proud of your sin. Jesus even says do not be proud of your sin. I hope everyone can find away to Jesus and away from the devil.
Love your amazing voice , songwriting and of course most of all your beautiful heart ! And I miss you a million xxooxx
We are all human. So please  don&#39;t embarrass someone because of their gender. If someone makes fun of you because of your gender, don&#39;t listen. Be yourself. Don&#39;t change as others want. I&#39;m bisexual and I am proud of myself. ❤❤❤❤❤<br>💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻<br>🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
This is the song I would sing to all my ex friends and boyfriends
This song and some of your songs gave me the courage to come out as a lesbain to my familly and freinds  Now  i am so much happier now that i can be who i really am
I love this song
I like the song but I don&#39;t like the theme which contains LGBT which is quite opposed by religion
I liked how well Demi sang in the pride parade in West Hollywood
Song for my last ex. I&#39;m looking for new opportunities and experiences. This time, the chance is for me. Not for who disappointed me for many times. I love myself
🤮🤮🤮
I think liking this song at 6 was a sign
Who didn’t come here because of tiktok?

Dede brown goes to Heaven.
If jesus loves all , then i have to reject Jesus as lord and Savior. <br>Im not sharing salvation, otherwise its just meaningless.<br>For that reason i must reject the Jesus character, he isn&#39;t reliable.<br><br>Still love this song though!!!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA&amp;t=137">2:17</a>
Jesus loved all but never laid with another man. His love is beyond your meager &quot;physical&quot; love you sorry mortal
Awesome  vibe from inside
There&#39;s mean girl in my soccer team and in my head I am telling them am doing this next time I see them ❤❤
I gasped when I saw her ex ...
This is the first time that I&#39;ve noticed Travis on the video
8 yıl mı ???? yaşlandım aq
How did I never find this before now? It&#39;s a beautiful music video and a great song. Perfect!
❤
God I forgot how hood song this was . Saw it on a rommie video
Nostalgia demais sucesso 🇧🇷
I thought I will be with my bf for a long time but he and I broke up 💔💔😢
Dang I was 3 when this song was made
Oh god I&#39;m in tears seeing this ;_; that opening. As a queer this hit so hard.
Ok!! But is that travis barker??? I&#39;ve watched this so many times n i just realised that
Got this as my personality song on Tik tok lmao
The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️
good song but video is gross
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA&amp;t=134">2:14</a><br>😨😨😨😨😨😨
This video makes me not like the song anymore
I really hated this.
I Loveee that Cher Lloyd is in it
She can Yell, Scream, Shout and Sing about it, buy she can&#39;t come &quot;Straight Out&quot; and say it!
Sdds de quando eu assistia esse clipe sem enteder nd
My fav part:BUT EVEN IF THE STAR THE MOON COLLIDE I NEVER WANT YOU BACK INTO MY LIFE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR WORDS AND ALL YOUR LIES  OH OH OH I REALLY DONT CARE !
Don&#39;t ever be ashamed for being LGBTQ+!!! Love is love and they can keep their religion in their churches!
Ughhh, I was really enjoying this video I haven`t seen in so long unitl <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA&amp;t=152">2:32</a>, I never liked him. Good thing he only appears a second

claiming she know Jesus and now she&#39;s worshiping Satan. Just Sad.
weather or not u support lgbt stuff, this song slaps either way
Good old days when these homophobic rats didn’t exist ❤
omggg i remember this sound😱😱😱😱❤️
I can&#39;t believe all these evil in this video
Demi so beautiful and very nice 😍 💕
Jesus made it so simple. “Love God, and love people” that’s it. Yes, it really is that simple. He didn’t say judge them, or ridicule them, you don’t get a pass if their way of life is different. No matter race, religion, sexual orientation, whatever. Love them.
Yes
I can imagine the dislike buttons
I like this song. <br>But people like Demi believe they have all the tolerance but only for people who share her world view.

8 yeas ago i i just love this song now i can understand this vedo and feel im also belongs to that rainbow 🌈
Why 2010s pop was so generic?
Who in 2023??
I love Demi Lovato 🥰
Astra inclinant, sed non obligant.<br>The stars incline, but they don&#39;t oblige. <br>Same sex politics isn&#39;t the obligation that sexism says it is. <br>The right to vote has been extended beyond what it was in ancient Athens or Rome.
Confused
Member when pride didnt involved adult men dressed as women shoving their junk in ten years olds faces? i member...
We should all have the option to protest freely, no matter what others think about the subject you intend to promote. That said, I&#39;m not bi, trans, or gay. I am a Heterosexual male. I don&#39;t have to be in support of the LGBTQ Community to accept their decisions on what they want to represent as. I&#39;ll treat people with respect, no matter the type or pronoun they decide to call themselves on.
Neighbors like to ruin people&#39;s health. Like mine. Cause of YouTube. These devices I have in my ears are lethal omg.
essa música saiu legal bastante sucesso 👏 parabéns gostei do tom do ritmo sou seu fã bjos Demi Lovato ps: Manel ❤️
Wish I could cut someone off mid sentence and sing them the part where she goes “oh oh I really don’t care!” Cause most of the times I don’t
like   this   song    tiktik
All of us in 2020 be like: I really don’t care
God loves you all
Hey, demi, you picked the wrong lover
Someone found I&#39;m jlos birth daughter
been listening to this on replay bc megan (swagatronforever) got me hooked again
i love this video
Yup , these idiots now are clearly losing the hate battle vs the gays so their guns are pointed at pregnat women cause they are &quot; killing babys &quot; and will go to hell , it&#39;s always before thebabyisborn &quot; don&#39;t do it we will help you &quot; , after the baby is born &quot; get a job moocher &quot;
Brooo the music is SUPER good!!!! Demi you look pretty tho
I&#39;m dying
I&#39;m dating max she letting me and I have 13 parrots and mini horse and a house and a job at home hardware down here
This video is so cringe it makes me homophobic
Literalmente esto está echo hace 8 años y yo literalmente ahora ya estamos en el 2021
Holaaa
Gostei da música muito boa em apoio as lgbtqs não sei se a demi e bisesual muito boa essa música
BE PROUD 🌈💪🏼🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
The Golden Age of Pop really was a better time just in terms of what music wanted us to feel. Happy.
Is the drummer kourtneys husband?
From the day this song came out it has been my anthem, only for me to come out as a lesbian in 2019🏳‍🌈
I don&#39;t feel good I don&#39;t know why I have mental health and autisum
Gods Love is Sodom and Gomorrah a Second Time.
Not an LGBT, But I heard this song playing in a Mall, and Yes! it was Catchy, I finally found it.
I&#39;m a Christian and I know what said, I hear,.  Keep my mouth shut   my daughter has a beautiful wife with 2 handsome sons and 2 gorgeous daughters.  I wish someone would say they are going to hell   because  I&#39;ma snatchem up show them how south hell is then pray for forgiveness  it&#39;s okay,  we all in this together. God loves us all and I&#39;d like to believe that my creator would rather have us love one another and none of my business how, then to  tear each other down and kill each other with the words of hate. So whatever you believe in, whoever you believe in, stand for something or you&#39;ll fall for everything. As for me, me and my house will serve the Lord.💯💯💯💯💯😇😎💜💜💜
show e bola man

💔💔 this is song oh god
When did they blur the faces in the background?!? They weren&#39;t blurred originally?!?
Still love it!🌈 Love from Hungary!
Ben ömrü hayatımda böyle bir güzellik böyle bir tatlılık böyle bir enerji görmedim. Klip zaten mükemmelinde ötesinde şarkıya diyecek yok zaten. İlk sıra da sia yer alıyor bende 2 inci sıraya demi levotoyu alıyorum demi levota  &lt;3
During my first ever college party, a buddy of mine stumbled into the room, shoutet &quot;AUA AUA AUA, i realy don´t care&quot; and just collapsed while puking everywhere.<br>Ever since then, this song has had a very special place in my heart!

Bullshit Song. I Hate LGBTQ Songs &amp; Movies.
Jkkjmmnn
I feel sick , dissapointed cause this is the first time watching this video uggg
Demi Lovato tava na parada gay
I love this song
My thoughts on this song..is this all about her ex-friend 🤭🤭😝😝..yo&#39;ll now whom I&#39;m preferring to 😝
This has to have one of the worst lyrics for a chorus, ever. <br><br>&quot;Even if a massive astronomical disaster occurred, I still wouldn&#39;t want to see you&quot; <br><br>ok.. just.. why
NOBOBYS FUCKED. ALL RIO SUCIDALS. Its Politics and Religions. THE WHOLE WORLD FUCKED THANKS KINDLY IN HER SONGS.
✌️
Didn&#39;t even know this was about pride until now, damn...
Did  you that video on you tube  were all the Simo resales were getting arrested
Like the song not the video
You can take your words and all your lies wow that sounds like the world is going through crisis
中学に出会った神曲
It’s sad when this is the most relatable song
mood rn:
Cher 💓
Damn girl bumping into everything that could squeal and you into the opportunity of deflating some tire that had its chance but only was scarred!
Lets Go Brandon
This is a great song, sucks how Joe goes out dating that Ashley girl after ending things with Demi, wish he never did that. but oh well?
they just care abt abnormal se*😭
😍😍😍
Auto tuneee
❤
It bad to god
this song is lit for roadtrip
This video really fits Demi now that she’s a part of the LGBTQ community 🏳️‍🌈❤

Que saudade de ouvir essa música com 13 anos
slayed
Revolting people, revolting lifestyle.
OK, it&#39;s 2022, and am I the only one who just now noticed Matthew Scott Montgomery is in this? He was in So R@n:0m!
The beginning of groomers, are gonna groom
🏳️‍🌈❤
2022?
😿 in my country if anyone knows I&#39;ma Gay , they will kill me ...
I  hate homosexuality but the song is unbelievable
Another amazing singer who ruined her career by conforming to the LGBTQ+ cultists&#39; media propaganda. Its so fucking sad
Ji re wall
This song is for my mother-in-law :P
Nice 👍
I think its cool how Demi is non-binary; Idk if im supporting them, I probably am😊
I really don’t have a problem with Gays because they are humans just like us and the people who hate them are just paranoid and mentally ill!
Did the songwriters get sued by icona pop for this? 😂
Fuck my ex and family who are not willing to  call me by my new name
Yeah god first created adam and johnson hahahahaha
This song pretty much says it all. But just in case you need to hear my words: I’m over it. Maybe someone will come along and change my mind someday. But honestly it’s up to the universe. You all f***ed up. You let that fraud mess with you and make you all walk away from me. You filled the wrong cup!! All of you!!! I was the only one filling your cup and now that I refuse to fill your cup you are finally realizing who the real one was and the fake. So since you choose the fake—keep her! The real one don’t want you back!! 🙏
Seeing a pride a parade makes me tear everytime 😭 I&#39;ll never experience this living / being born in a homophobic country is a worst thing that can happen to a lgbt person
the song is good but the music video is a big L
why everyone gotta wear the leash and colar that is religion, the sooner humans soo that religion is a false way of controlling the masses the sooner humans will prosper, we are all human, from earth, or diversity defines us, but we are human and pathetic and need a &quot; god&quot; to guide us cuz without a fictional deity we are idiotic murderous panicky animals.
Indeed Jesus loves all. Don&#39;t be mean people because Jesus loves everyone no matter the gender. ♥️
Que nostalgia ❤
Hello 2022 😁

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJGUbwVMBeA&amp;t=152">2:32</a> Demi wrote a song abt that dude. Stream &quot;29&quot; by Demi Lovato!
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
i’m bisexual💖💜💙/pansexual💖💛💙 and non-binary💛🤍💜🖤, i love this song. i’m not out to my dad, he believes lgbtq+ people follow a trend and are confused, my mom needs time to adjust to me being lgbtq+, my sister is the most accepting and understanding.🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Me acuerdo cuando jugaba un juego de vestir a Barbie y siempre se repetía esta canción 😩😢
You are going to hell if you support these new trends. Demi herself isn&#39;t gay.she should practice what she is preaching😄😄

Quando eu era mais nova eu escutava essa musica mas meu pai nunca deixou eu ver o clipe porque era uma coisa &quot;feia&quot;, hoje eu entendi que era por causa da Parada LGBTQI+ e ele não deixar eu ver o clipe da musica não adiantou nada kkkkkk
She deserves so many grammys for this

When I was a kid I loved this song it made me so happy,  I’m so glad I found it on my YouTube recommended
It&#39;s time that Demi collabs with Travis again, specially now with the HOLY FVCK era
“You don’t have to hate because my Jesus loves all” felt that

Heroic pop music from Demi Lovato.<br>And &quot;heroic&quot; is the right word.<br>Talking about the song here, not the video.<br>Though the video is cool too.  Super cool.<br>Thanks Demi.

Beautiful Demi, I want to be in a concert.

I remember hearing this when I was finishing my first year in High School in 2014. Man, I miss the good old days so much!
Esse cabelo estava tão lindo..
The Rapture<br><br>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.<br>1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.<br>Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.<br>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.<br>Deuteronomy 30:19 R.M<br><br>WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?
THATS A GOOD WAY TO CELEBRATE JUNE NOT BECAUSE ITS THE LAST MONTH OF SCHOOL YEAR ITS ALSO LGBTQ MONTH
She is soooo stunning with black hair!

This is the song or video for which Demi Lovato will be loved and never be forgotten, Happy PRIDE 2022 everybody 🙌🏳️‍🌈👏 thanks Demi 🙃😘
is the travis barker in the drums? lolololol<br>after 8 years, i see this
I love this song I am bisexual and I have a friend who is gay I love her very much
Happy pride month in June 2022!
I always thought that the Cher Lloyd was soooo short ! She should have joined during the verses and the chorus too.<br>Honestly, she wasn&#39;t necessary on this track. Demi was more than enough, but I just wish they did a proper collaboration song.

Demi vuelve a lo que fuiste dios, te amo
While it is true that Jesus loves everyone, that does not mean that he represents gay and all that. It clearly states in the Bible that homosexuality is wrong. Don&#39;t let a popular artist and a catchy song mislead you and misinterpret what Jesus stood and died for
HAPPY PRIDE💖🌈
Te amo demi

Man, this song still SLAPS
Imagine if you died right now, where would your soul go for eternity? Was everything you ever did without purpose and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing after you take your last breath? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss. Hell is real, place of eternal torment. You&#39;re gonna spend eternity in one of those places. God&#39;s will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you have never broken any of God’s Laws, in other words, if you have never committed sin, and every single one of us have sinned. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven’s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in the same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, died for us, so we may be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan&#39;s tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.<br> <br>If you truly repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins from Jesus Christ, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, rose from the dead by God’s power on the third day according to The Holy Bible, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Every sin that weighs down your inner being, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend eternity in Heaven with our Holy King, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.<br> <br>John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believeth in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.<br> <br>John 14:6 - Jesus said unto him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (to Heaven) except through Me.“<br> <br>Book of Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.<br> <br>Romans 10:9-10 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br> <br>Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.<br> <br>Romans 8:1-2 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus (born again of the Holy Spirit), who walk not after the flesh, but after the (Holy) Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.<br> <br>1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.<br> <br>Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br> <br>Isaiah 1:18 - Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br> <br>John 10:10 – (Jesus said:) “The thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.“<br> <br>1 Peter 5:8 - Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking, whom he may devour.<br> <br>Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br> <br>The LORD bless you and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.<br> <br>In Jesus Christ Holy and Mighty Name. Amen.
