Was Thor a human here or was he a regular Asgardian? I don&#39;t think Odin could turn Asgardians into humans

TOHR BACK POWER VS EIVL THE DESTROYER
TOHR MOVIE 2011
thor<br>xxx<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USglQWkrbYo">https://youtu.be/USglQWkrbYo?si=I05fUpxMLXEF4e7_</a>
I remember liking the Thor movie a lot...but this scene kinda sucks.  If Thor is dead, how does he stick his hand up to grab the hammer before it reaches him?  How does twirling a blunt-headed hammer over his head let him make a tornado?  (Remember, as presented before Thor Ragnarok, Asgardian &quot;magic&quot; is nothing but extremely advanced science, so aside from standard superhero handwaves about giant insects and indestructible costumes, stuff like that, we should be critical of any significant plot point that claims to be scientificially possible but obviously doesn&#39;t work the way it should.)    I think they were too interested in getting a fairly stock Hollywood moment of the Jesus-esque hero&#39;s journey being darkest before the dawn, and it feels really forced here.  If I was either Odin or Mjolnir, I doubt I would pronounce this version of Thor worthy, based on him simply telling the Destroyer to kill him first before continuing its rampage unimpeded.
Bro flew so high
he went for the head
Vader and thor‚Ä¶.Natalie‚Äôs racking up quite a list lol
How I fell getting hit in the head with a fuckin ice pick and everyone thinks it&#39;s a fuckin joke. Ain&#39;t no joke when you have to live with it.
Jane&#39;s reaction omgüòÑüëå
I actually like how Eric see it flying and knows right away like bitch gtfo now!
I forgot how good the music was in this movie
I remember when i first watched this. 2 months ago.
Look at your hero, look how he suffered, look how he had to prove himself, it wasnt about being a man, it was about pushing his limits to become a better person and that&#39;s why he was powerful. Power should never come free from gender alone
Bhai ye movie mujhe bej saak te ho kya please ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
considering the destroyer is the sole guardian of odin&#39;s treasure run, is very weak
The foolish part of this scene is that Thors friends dont come running to Thor as well as he lay dying.
I hear Natalie Portman has a massive gapper, but I cant confirm.
That movie is from a time when MARVEL made great movies. And now? Disney uses Marvel as a cashcow. Quantity instead of QUALITY!
Natalie Portman open your wormhole

Gee, Thor&#39;s transformation into himself again is just incredible
Growing up, Thor was always my favorite. But he never could beat the Destroyer. He always had to trick him or outsmart him. The movie version of the Destroyer is a wimp. The MCU makes a lot of changes from the original plots.
It was great when thor wasn&#39;t one big walking joke

poor direction and bad acting. from crying goes to a moderate &quot;oh my god&quot;. the other girl is laughing like an idiot. It is very bad to avoid commenting on it.

difference between the mcu writers then and now .... the writers back then understood the heroes journey and self sacrifice. now its nothing but OP girl bosses and whiny self indulgence.

I have the Power!
I can‚Äôt tell you how many great movies have been ruined to me because of the stupid love cliche a lot of films do. Jane is a part of the Thor movies I can‚Äôt get over, she‚Äôs just cringe.
Mjolnir and (arrogant) Thor was a love story
Patrick doyle&#39;s music is so epic underrated !!
This movie is ass
One of the best scenes in all marvel movies......and there are a lot good scenes^^ (sorry for my english, i¬¥m a german üòÇ)
This version of thor could defeat thanos , with the final epic storm
That is how Thor got his groove back.....<br>Man I miss the old MCU
It was the best thor movie according to me
For your information, the destroyer is not dead. Firelord certainly came to Earth to trade his freedom, bringing the Destroyer&#39;s body to Galactus, who then became a herald of Galactus.
The tear Odin has while asleep after seeing his son do such a selfless act that got him killed just to save a town full of humans was the best part. Odin learned right there that Thor had changed and was worthy as a king and most of all to have his Norse god powers and mjolnir back.
That chick is so annoying and cringe..
In the entirety of the MCU the 2 worst lines are Janes &quot;Oh. My. God&quot; and Pepper Potts &quot;Indeed I am&quot;.  so cringe.
That was crazy mjolnir ‚ù§Ô∏è
One of the most underrated scenes out of any marvel film in history

I always found funny how this destroyer was presented like some super menace that is capabale of huge destruction and really hard to deal with<br><br>And then he‚Äôs basically one-shot lmao
They really ignored Thor‚Äôs super heroic theme music forever after, eh
Seriously, how good is Patrick Doyle&#39;s score for this movie? Genius.
thor has been thunderstruck

Hummer is main
i&#39;d heard that Thor had a lot of dutch angles, but since i&#39;d never seen the movie i didnt think it would be too bad, then i watched this and ended it with my head a skew, Kenneth Branagh you are one amazing director... but here you went a bit far
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=140">2:20</a> when Thor grabs the hammer and then his armour appears, is probably one of the top 5 mcu moments, others being captains entrance in Infinity war backing wanda and vision, and also thors entrance in wakanda in infinity war too.<br>But one very underrated scene is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=82">1:22</a> when Odin in his Odin sleep sheds that tear upon thors death right upto that epic line &quot;whoever is worthy...&quot;<br>, even in Odins comatose type sleep and from such a vast distance,   odins soul still cried out upon his sons death, a death he wud certainly be proud of n 1 id like to  think he was aware of. And then off course thors resurrection .  I mean really, from the death, odins reaction and then thors resurrection,  just sheer brilliant storytelling .
HOW could Disney fumble this bag so hard?!?!
What I don&#39;t understand about this movie is it made it seem like Thor became &quot;human&quot; when being stripped of all his powers. But really his baseline would be Asgardian, which would still be an extremely strong and durable being.
Who else comes back here to remember that this is what Thor is all about. I‚Äôm saying this now, who on Earth thought that too much forced humor in some of the most recent MCU movies would be a good idea and success for the storylines? Though not all recent marvel movies have cheesy humor. And obviously when I say most recent mcu movies I mostly mean Thor 4/love and thunder. After phase 3, most of the recent mcu movies are pretty good/great. Shang-Chi, Eternals, Spider-Man No Way Home, and I even like Ant Man 3‚Ä¶
Let&#39;s who is watching this after June 2023
Most underrated MCU movie ever
Thor should have inhabited the Destroyer armor in Rangarok to fight Hela or even Thanos in Avengers Infinity War
Even though I mostly love this scene, I still can&#39;t get over Thor easily dispatching the Destroyer Armor.  In the comics, the Destroyer Armor is among the most powerful weapons in the entire Marvel Universe.  It has given Thor and other major powerhouses a run for their money.  Hell, it even scared the shit out of Galactus at one point.

Damn, almost forgot Thor could actually create tornadoes and manipulate the weather instead of, you know... Only throwing lightning. <br><br>Like what happened? Did they forget he could do all this stuff? Or they just said he would be too overpowered?
You don&#39;t gain superpowers when you&#39;re hit by lightning. There&#39;s a faint taste of pennies for a few years and you pee blood for a couple weeks. And I didn&#39;t get a magic hammer!
I have the powerrrrrr
Rest in Peace, Ray Stevenson. Let the Valkyries guide you to the Hals of Valhalla, where the brave shall live forever.
guess its a good thing the destroyer decided not to fire him instead of just hitting him, then we wouldn&#39;t have thor anymore haha.  Love plot armor.

I&#39;m mad now because this dweeb was able to create Tornadoes and never once said hey maybe I should probably use this again. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen this movie that I forgot that he could even do it üòÇ.
I wish Thor would create that tornado more often in fights. So cool
Now THIS is Thor!
I love the part of, &quot;Everyone back up, Thor about to fuck him up&quot;
When the destroyer smacked Thor,the cgi looked bad
Great movie Thor v /Destroyer
So cheez Portman.. yuck..
I wish we could‚Äôve seen Thor summoning a tornado in the later films like he did in the first movie
I love this scene
Every shot really was diagonal in this movie
Tony Stark can defeat that Asgardian Robot. He will struggle but he will win eventually.<br>Thanos can destroy it easily.<br>Hulk would smash it with one attack.<br>Strange would use portal to turn it&#39;s laser back to itself.<br>Scarlet Witch would turn it into dust with a blink of eye.
I love the cheap neck snap sound effect making this crazy expensive movie sound like it was edited with movie maker 2012

And as he&#39;s walking in triumph from the wreckage and smoke, someone sticks a damn commercial right in the damn way.  Thumbs down!!!!

Really don‚Äôt get the Portman hate, she did a decent job in this film and the whole credibility of Thor learning humility rested on the Thor/Jane relationship. That ‚ÄúOh my God‚Äù line is a decent little joke about her realising he is indeed a god. I certainly dont hate it.<br><br>This is one of the top Marvel films for me and it‚Äôs the characters that make it work so well..there‚Äôs more than enough been said about the fantastic Thor/Loki relationship and only Thanos challenges Loki for best bad guy in the MCU.
The destroyer got destroyed!

This movie was 10 times better than the trash called &quot;Love and Thunder&quot;
This Thor is so much better than the newer one. Bring this style back Marvel.
Thor never lost his power. He was just unaware that the power came from himself which is why he can still control the weather ( as seen in his attempt on mjolnr
i like thor
The Destroyer kind of remind me of the Sentinels from X-Men, or at least the designs of both characters are eerily similar.

I love this film because it had the best representation of both Thor and Loki, they look and act the most accurately of all the mcu films. We also got to see more of what Asgard life is like.

You know with the way thor acts now he shouldn&#39;t be worthy he acts the same as now as he did when Odin diddnt deem him worthy and by the mcu logic almost everyone in age of ultron should of been worthy idk maybe its like Odin showed him a lesson and just let him stay worthy if only in endgame cap was like &quot;hey Tony! Hold this real quick&quot; after he snapped
For a being who&#39;s only power was strength and fire breath, The Destroyer came off as super intimidating

Soo he can be worthy but getting slapped by some robot dude but iron man can‚Äôt get worthy when he jumped into space risking his life
I love Thor&#39;s small smile when his brother&#39;s robor turns away and he thinks that he loves him, then POW!
Gort?
Yo they nerfed Thor
Man, remember when marvel had the slightest bit of emotional depth.
So weird that they had The Destroyer, of all characters, get run over by Thor. In the comics, The Destroyer is as far above Thor in terms of power as Thor is above the average human. He&#39;s Asgard&#39;s ultimate line of defense, essentially unbeatable in battle.
Still the best Thor film!

Movie name please
Damn I forgot how egregious the dutch tilts are in this movie. I keep twisting my head.
As usual, the bad guy mildly wounds the good guy and walks away just long enough for the good guy to get his powers back.
No one is gonna deal with the fact that Mjolnir just sonic boom? <br><br>This is the best Thor movie in the Thor franchise btw.
The first 2 Thor movies are the only MCU movies I&#39;ve fallen asleep during. I cannot believe that scene was only 4 minutes. They just drag.
Damn we really need this Thor coupled with Stormbreaker.

Thor swinging his hammer be like: Helicopter, helicopter
Ew phase 1
&quot;oh you are quite brave, I won&#39;t kill you&quot;<br>....<br>&quot;just joking bitch&quot;
Thor went from being the character that just wanted power and to be feared to being one of the best characters in the MCU
always wondered this but never asked<br>isn&#39;t the destroyer armor supposed to be hella OP?

I would have liked to think that for just once my father sheds a single tear for me.<br> Only one.<br> He never did that even when I was in the hospital.<br> Never.
Are we ignoring how fatidically horrendous the CGI is at this specific part? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=19">0:19</a>
How they ever thought that Thor love and Thunder would beat this is beyond me. This is the true Thor that fans like and will always be a fan of
This is what Thor is supposed to be. Taika turned him into a clown. Although Chris Hemsworth‚Äôs comedic timing is impeccable and he is entertaining as comic Thor, that is not the direction I like for Thor.
What have odin done?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=171">2:51</a> is it just me, or does thor kinda look like jesus in this shot?

I love how half assed this movie is
Bring back this Thor
Cgi looked like garbage
One simple fight scene is much better than Thor: Love and Trash.
In this Thor was manly , courageous, charismatic, passionate and mainly A God. Not some weak ass pussy joker dumbass like in thor 4
I thought I saw a triquetra on Thor&#39;s hammer...
Utter bilge
Idc what anyone says, this movie‚Äôs MUCH better than ragnarok, at least it actually feels like a thor story that doesn‚Äôt turn a badass tragic god into a comedian

I always hated how stiff and fake this character looked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=22">0:22</a> I mean look at that CG it‚Äôs awful
When the destroyer hits thor for the first time it was so funny the cgi looked so janky
This film has best ending fight and song than a others marvel movies like captain marvel, antman, spiderman homecoming, iron man 3 , blackpanter...

This is what Thor is meant to be. <br>A arrogant hero humbled by his actions and life among mortals. A strong badass that you can take seriously. <br>Unfortunately recent Thor films turn him into a silly juvenile jokester who doesn‚Äôt act anything like the matured Thor in the early films. <br>Additionally the music was so much better in this compared to any other Thor film.
I cant wait for love and thunder when they reunite
The Destroyer reminds me of The Sentinels

Every few months I watch this scene and each of those times, I feel chills go down my spine when the hammer reaches Thor&#39;s hand and his heroic theme plays. Just perfect.

I don&#39;t care what a single person says otherwise, this was the only time we were entertained by a Thor film while the directors actually took the character seriously. Ragnorok is literally just one big joke, and I miss compelling serious moments like these that don&#39;t feel the need to make a joke out of everything.
Someday in the not-so-distant future, it‚Äôs gonna be you suiting up like that, Jane.

What a stupid &amp; brain dead scene. It could certainly qualify as the masses&#39; guilty pleasure.<br>This shows our collective IQs are just so dismal. And then most of us go around thinking that the only bad thing in the world right now is Putin.<br>I think this is why we are so stupid, actually: because we are served with the idea that it&#39;s all Putin&#39;s fault. We just lap all shit like this up like it was whipped cream and now it&#39;s OK to go about our lives like mindless drones. Nothing&#39;s literally our fault because TV has laid it all on Putin.

Thor was so strangeüòÇüòÇ
Endgame: you should have gone for the head<br><br>Years before that: went for the head
‚ÄªThe Manchurian country was the breakwater which prevented aggression of the European and American Great Powers. Because this breakwater was torn, the Soviet Union invaded Manchurian and stole the Japanese northern territories The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Russia, China, North Korea become the Communist Party nation, and Korea carries out an anti-Japan activity, too. The rotation of Japan is full of enemy countries. Asian Communist Party prevented becoming it Manchurian country. When the United States thrusts Hull notebook and withdraws from Manchurian. Because it led to destroying a country to withdraw in Manchurian, Japan set war for self-defense and liberation in Asia. When it is a war crime. Russia, the United States, China still take Japan in the same pro-war inclination country in old days.<br><br>The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and a phase contradicted freedom each other. If a company raises profit freely, there is it, and a rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if I have the frames saying that I do it equally. The worker competes against a company for a right. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by a secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism?<br>The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore I am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform a fixed quarrel when I understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States lets you shoot a missile for Japan.<br><br>The human whom the United States drops an atom bomb and I burn you to death to a woman, a child, a baby and slaughtered is the greatest devil in history. I used it as a guinea pig and killed a Japanese 400,000. Why does the United States not apologize? The United States won against the Great War and got world hegemony. Because the American obtains the right, it is equally punishable. The United States gave a vivid description of the power of the atom bomb and threatened the Soviet Union in it and had a world right in my hand. It is wrong with unfairness to make economic sanctions because the United States of such devil lets North Korea abandon a nucleus.<br><br>The accident of Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights is a stratagem of the United States. By a threat to let Japan accept the Plaza Accord, the U.S. military plane shot it down and burnt the person who survived to death by a flame thrower. 520 victims were considered to be a sacrifice. The United States caused a bubble burst by a strong yen instruction and a share price manipulation, and Salomon Brothers sold it at a profit before the sudden fall of the stock and thereby plundered Japanese financial power of a nation. The discovery of the crash point was not late and was a delaying action of the evidence destruction. It is the collection of the piece of the missile and destruction work of the pressure bulkhead.<br><br>As for the Japanese slaughter case that I performed of Mason of the United States, there are emperor silver case, Nabari poison wine case, Fukuchiyama Line derailment, Chinese food plane crash, Wakayama poison curry case, the sarin subway attacks in Tokyo, the Matsumoto sarin incident, Kyoto animation arson terrorist incident besides. Because the Akihabara slasher case had a suspicious point in various ways, Tomohiro Kato of the criminal might receive a hypnotic suggestion, brainwashing.<br><br>In other words, Mason of the devil rules the world and schemes the world conquest using the United States. Because the greatest enemy is Japan, economy interferes it to destroy it thoroughly and is going to poison you using medical care, food. In Japan, a politician is assassinated if I go against an American policy to order, and the nation is slaughtered by a mysterious case not to know of the reason, too. Because Shoichi Nakagawa refused purchase of the US Treasury, I was assassinated.<br><br>An American, a Chinese, a Korean do the cruel brutality case.<br>[brutal person and „Å∞„ÇÄ cruelty] In tyushu case by the Chinese soldier, as for the man-eating group, the Korean, American Mason that exceeds far eat-like-a-dog manner group it drinks blood and the meat of the infant.<br>If rape it, and eight women are stabbed to death at the Asahi eaves, and people split lengthwise see mind;-resistant; did not pass. I looked at the person „Åå„ÅÆ dead body like the proprietress at a close tower on the waterside entrance. As for the man, an eyeball is dug out; the upper body is hive . At the Japanese store close to the Nanjo gate, the dead body of the person like the master was left on the way, and a bone of the middle was exposed, and the internal organs were scattered.<br>There is the trace which almost all is fired, and the dead body of the Japanese boy left in a firm and the government office touches a rope, and took, and the blood sprays it on the wall, is for a language.<br>The video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DW3zwolwtM&amp;t=36">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DW3zwolwtM&amp;t=36s</a><br><br>A Japanese, awake. All the aims of the Chinese nuclear missile are sent to Japan. It is the United States that controls North Korea in the back and gives a Japanese abduction case, an order of the missile launch. These are parts of Japanese race extinction operation, and Japan is burnt to the ground by nuclear attack. The United States attacks it to Japan with the armed forces of the world. A Japanese deceived in the fraud of Japan-U.S. security treaty stupid.<br><br>Near future to read from Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan<br>April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3. It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in a land of the gods, and the evil god holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God.<br>x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021.<br>World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes are generated in all parts of the world. <br>An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br>The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br>Final note<br>The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. It is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light. Are all of you ready?
can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 11 years since release date
Please bring Portman back to MCU...

that walk in the end like he‚Äôs so used to this kills me
this clip is great
That dramatic walk at the end was my favorite part
Thor back then: literal god of the sky with Zeus-level power<br>Thor now: Pew pew lightning go boom
It&#39;s so cool how moljner returns to him
so why he didn&#39;t fight like that against thanos ? :s

What is the movie name?
Cgi at its peak
The CG at the end is not good
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforjohnny">#JusticeforJohnny</a> pity wb disney and marvel are on the wrong side of history. I hope they realize their mistakes cos I really want to see their movies.
Dude I swear that thing was like 3 times bigger when I watched it when it first came out lol
Damn he bitched slapped Thor like dat
why did they nerf thor so much after his first movie?
The ritzy perch reassuringly satisfy because age philly tempt including a trashy patricia.  fixed, zesty lyric
Movie name p
Never watched and never will.
this effect of him slapping the tor is kind of ridiculous, it seems that there was a lack of budget for the fx effect
Omg this is horrible what this movie make 199 million?
Now that I look at this after so much time...<br>Janes acting looks........... kinda fake
She said no just √±ike in star wars , no Heineken, when obiwan lands in the plane
Are we gonna ignore the fact where padme leaves anakin for thor
Bait
Now Thor hammer is female because woke Marvel i swear NA pop culture comics are absolutely trash it&#39;s a shame the MCU is gonna suffer because of left politics gender studies.
Come-on btich fight distroyer
I remember seeing this destroyer. This thing still looks terrifying.
The effects of the backhand to the face are done so badly.
Revendo essa cena dps de tanto tempo s√≥ percebo agora o quanto ela √© enfadonha e vergonha alheia kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk terr√≠vel
I honestly thought he was trolling her, and that he was just faking.
Damn it‚Äôs so funny Mcu Thor fans hate the first 2 movies so much and want to dick suck the third I actually like the first one and it‚Äôs direction with the Asgardians more than any other movie and Loki and Thor‚Äôs character development in the first two is unreal
The 2000s and slanted shots went hand and hand
nooooo

I don&#39;t think Anakin would appreciate that LOL!
Loki‚Äôs face looks so innocent in this movie
It&#39;s amazing how forgettable all the pre avengers movies are. Apart from iron man 1. If anyone remembers captain America it&#39;s because it&#39;s just a kid friendly saving private Ryan
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not over.  We have 2 sequels and 4 avengers movies to film.‚Äù
Scene look like of DC movie
it looks like Odin removed the condition and returned the power to Thor. I Can&#39;t see anything special in Thor to be worthy among everyone
If he does that to Thor then If the destroyer hit a civilian they should explode into a red fog
The first Thor movie reminds me of a very specific time period in cinema. Like, the weird Michael Bay-ish way of making movies with unnecessary slow motion and dutch camera angles.
Kenneth Branagh dutch angled the <b>**</b> out of this scene.
Jane and Thor were prolly the worst couple
This was such a dumb fight
For dark world‚Ä¶

Dying probably is the most realistic action to getting a bitch slap from a big ass metal boi
The &quot;oh... my... God...&quot; sounds very fake and ill-rehearsed. I&#39;m sure Natalie Portman had a lot of different takes. Unfortunately the director chose a poor one.
J
Thor : &quot;Kill me and end this&quot;<br>Loki : Kills him and ends it<br>Also Thor when he got his powers back : You dare to touch me mf.
I forgot how awesome the destroyer looks
Why is everyhing at an angle?

This is god-awful-<br>Thor would certainly not be dead from one hit, and they would have definitely picked him up and tried to get him medical attention, not just- ASSUME he was dead<br>The tears also seemed insanely fake, and so did their reactions when he &quot;became Thor&quot;.<br>And then, when Thor was flying in the air- WHY DIDN&#39;T THE &quot;DESTROYER&quot; SHOOT HIS BEAM?? THOR WAS BUSY SWINGING HIS HAMMER, HE WOULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BLOCK IT XDDDD<br><br>This is a laugh fest, but I guess that&#39;s what makes it enjoyable
Which movies is this..??
Who was that at the end?
god seeing this<br>thor:*grab hammer
Why all the dutch angles?
The last scene is op. It looks like nothing happened üòÇ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=205">3:25</a> proved Chris Hemsworth follows cricket. I guess a big fan of Ricky Ponting. üòú

Are you Thor God of hammer
That&#39;s why Rogers can &quot;summon&quot; thunder in the avengers ! &quot;shall have the power of Thor&quot;
just gonna throw this out there, loki is controlling it with like 3 seconds of delay while he is galaxies away? uhh... magic
I was really hype when thor gained his powers and the fight but now seeing this fight make me realize why was it so short??
Lmfao!! Im so glad i dont waste my time watching these movies anymore.
Give me a good quality can opener and I&#39;d beat this &#39;Destroyer&#39;
Anakin!!!
Thor the God of comebacks
now he was nerfed
god I&#39;m so glad Natalie Portman wasn&#39;t in the rest of the movies.
The director of this movie dosnt know what destroyer is.....<br>This was disappointing
he can summon that hammer from a different universe for god sake you can just kill him lol

I legit thought this was a clip from xmen days of future past, then I read the title
Anyone else notice how the cut over his eye @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=45">0:45</a> foreshadows him losing that same eye to Hela?
The worst Marvel movie of all time. I&#39;d rather watch Spiderman on &quot;Electric Company&quot;.

Poor destroyer, it went for the head and still failed
This woman&#39;s attractiveness distilled vanilla water. It&#39;s so fucking boring to look at her.
This thing was made to fight Celestials in the comics, MCU Destroyer is heavily nerfed.
So the destroyer who instantly vaporized frost giants could easily be killed by thor in a matter of seconds, but thor and his warrior crew had to be saved by odin from a bunch of frost giants
man this movie so bad i keep forgetting it exist.

I hope Natalie can make the MIghty Thor costume look good as the comics, she&#39;s quite petite.

These scenes are so stupid. Why didn‚Äôt the destroyer just walk over there and crush Thor‚Äôs head while he was down.<br><br>Makes no sense.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLcJ6UO5_Y&amp;t=22">00:22</a> it is interesting how intuitively we know there is a problem in this scene.<br>  When Thor is hit, he should keep rolling in the air, but the roll suddenly stops and he keep going in the air.

Just want to take this opportunity to vomit in Chris Hemsworth&#39;s face. Prissy little aussie girl didn&#39;t like the way Thor&#39;s helm made his hair look,  so they never made him wear it past the first scene. OH, I&#39;m sorry Chris you piece of shit,  I&#39;m 56, got a full run of Thor from Journey into Mystery 84, buying comics since I was a kid,  waiting my whole life to see a decent comic book movie,  BUT YOU DON&#39;T LIKE HOW THE FUCKING HELMET LOOKS? YOU DON&#39;T DESERVE TO SMELL THE ASS OF THAT COSTUME AFTER I WORE IT FOR A MONTH,  AND HAD NOTHING BUT TACOS AND BEER TO EAT YOU BOWL OF OATMEAL OF A HUMAN. I HOPE THAT COSTUME GIVES YOU AN INCURABLE CHAFF THAT MAKES YOU PICK YOUR ASS IN PUBLIC FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.  You&#39;re the margarine of Thors. You&#39;re the diet cola of Thors.

The only film that respected and got Thor&#39;s powerset right, I love how he included the formation of a tornado showcasing Thor&#39;s control over weather and the elements. Something we never see again sadly, would love to have seen him summon &quot;the winds of a thousand worlds&quot;.

It makes me sad that every single character in the MCU has become a snarky jokester.  I miss this Thor.

Bitch, I&#39;m Thor.
I liked it when this Destroyer guy was on South Park during the Stuffing Wars.
Every time I see that scene, all I hear is &quot;Oh, My, Terrible Acting&quot; She was a plank in Star Wars, she&#39;s a plank in these and will be a plank as Thorina. What was it he called Thor ? OH ! Yeah. That&#39;s what they should call the movie, not Love and Thunder but Thorina, goddess of sparkly fingers
Viva las vegas!
This looks like WB tv show

Good scene
este parece un centinela de los x men
Loki put up more of a fight and he isn&#39;t even a fighter.

I think the OMG wasn&#39;t necessary
Pink ranger still hot

Well ideally people die of that punch from destroyer ..Thor with no powers isn&#39;t it ..but they cannot kill a cash cow
Was that a sentinel from xmen?

The worst mcu film besides the sequel. Just terrible.

Le falt√≥ decir... &quot;con el poder de greiscol&quot; XD
Superman ist st√§rker und einfach der bessere Charakter
Bloody shit! Hahahaha
is it just me or does ‚Äúthe destroyer‚Äù look a lot like a modified version of those things that were trying to kill off the mutants in Days of Future Past?
Destroyed got destroyed in minutes
Hard to watch any movie now knowing the B&#39;s communism that runs through ot

That&#39;s when Thor didn&#39;t have humour
The last immediate storm off scene has issue.
Thor is so cringe.
Ahahah
More coffee!
God damn were those thor movies bad. The only good one was ragnarok
It go down too easily, in the comix it&#39;s a scaring thing being chased by the distructor literally nothing on earth could scratch that motherf****er piece of armour
Gees!!!
I like this pre &quot;The Avengers&quot; era where everything is raw-ish...
If your around Thor and you don&#39;t see his hammer,but hear a jet stream get the hell out of there
They want us to focus on the fight but for some reason they keep showing the lady at regular intervals. Are we fighting or not? Pick one
It&#39;s capped resurrection it&#39;s true.... Not just for Thor....for all of us brothers and sister... Wake

ah yes the god of hammers
I&#39;ve never seen this and haven&#39;t watched very few &quot;superhero&quot; movies but this is incredible.
The first thor movie was the best
The Hollywood - just crushing all the laws of physics,biology, chemistry and even commonsense ü§£
Movie name ??
Lame
Filme incrivel
Now that&#39;s a bitch slap jeez.
the o my god line was so poorly delivered it still bothers me to this day

have to says be cool to have power back
Thor throughly kicked his assüí™
In Norse mythology Thor was unbelievably powerful but his hammer was the most powerful weapon ever forged capable of tearing down thousands of giants and yet here it takes him a minute to take down the destroyer......<br>Which is a little pathetic in comparison
