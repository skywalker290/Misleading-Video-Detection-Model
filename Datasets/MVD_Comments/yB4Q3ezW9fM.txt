i jumped down my chair when sven teleported in to the creeper frick cage
The council has returned. This is such good news to me. OG watersheep can live on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=571">9:31</a> Damn, this is a journey
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=469">7:49</a> This is turned very culty
bri got honeyblocks from Československo. Nice.

The one who claims to be my mother has your image and pp.
You did not even know who you were.
My son was my husband
So being you are not to worried to get your pp back, if you want/need it.....well IAM going to allow you to get it your self.
All of you let me suffer.....
Help me retrieve your pp
pewds was so happy having so much fun playing at the start of the series and it was enjoyable to watch......but  after the dragon things changed.....things got weird.... i thought damn, pewds might actually have some mental problems......then i thought  I must have some mental problems for still watching this lol
council of water shjeep!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=154">2:34</a> I wonder what Marzia&#39;s reaction is to hearing pewdiepie screaming &quot;INGVAR&quot; from his room
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=236">3:56</a>)))))))))))))))

Time Traveler Pewds confirmed? He would have had to go back at least 32 years to import honey from Czechoslovakia...
Russian Pewds confirmed?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=100">1:40</a> new best music your house looks amazing
Imagine if jeb_ and grey watersheep are different sheeps.
Bro I usually play Bredock Editoin so to see a piston pull a slime block and that then pull others attached to it just defies all laws of Minecraft to me
I love how it starts just fine, him building his redstone contraptions, showing off the base, messing with mobs just a little bit, like spawning some chickens to punish a creeper, and then immediately spirals downward into madness with: ThErE Is A WaY To BrInG BaCk ThE CoUnCiL Of WaTeRsHeEp?
Police Officer: &quot;We found copious amounts of cocaine inside your house&quot; Me: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s imported from Czechoslovakia&quot;
When did pewds become mumbo jumbo<br>Hez speaking redstone language
i can imagine felix going in creative mode here and saying its alright because he imported creative mode from Czechoslovakia
Why did the last half of this series become an acid trip??!!! Fuckin Banjo Kazooie sounds are driving me nuts. Oof.
He&#39;s turning in to mumbo jumbo
is this canon?
remmember when this was a normal series
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=114">1:54</a> I think I head it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=105">1:45</a> ; Listen closely.. it sounds like the drums in Rio, when the movie is about to introduce the monkeys.

i have a friend from czech
tết coi hài cho vui nhà vui cửa
Sven sounds like he&#39;s been smoking for fifteen years
What happened to this searies
the chicken beat slaps
Look at all those chickens
Watersheep was always this powerful, he was just too afraid to say it
I heard the song the chimckens made its like uhhh uhhhh uhhh uhh
When he think checkoslovakia still exists: <br>Im sorry, it&#39;s dead
I&#39;ve never thought those cheap ass sounds affect will be this funny
watersheep seems harder to beat than the ender dragon
Bruh water sheep legit stronger than wither
I love how sven talks like:GRAGU GO GRE GU GAA GRO RU RUR JA
When you realize<br>That <br>Water sheep<br>Was stronger than<br>Ender dargon
Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been two years
Pog
Imagine if pewdiepie never got even
Since when did the animal characters have weird voices?
BIG BRAIN <br>redstone secret door
Some sheep, escaping from a farm, stuck in a small area of water: Ah, well.... hope I get fed atleast.<br><br>A couple minutes later, Felix: <b>He was like father too me...</b><br><br>The ghost of the stuck sheep: <b>Why tf am I a God?</b>
Top 20 most epic anime fight
Not sure if anyone else has notice or appreciates it but I love how you are using the Banjo-Kazooie/Banjo-Tooie character voice sounds as your Minecraft character voices. It’s hilarious and nostalgic.
Find a sheep, perform the sacrificial ritual. When its done, get another sheep ready for the next ritual XD
Subtiles is saying at Hnoeu block Hyundai hock
The base of your house light is awsome
Honey blocks imported from Czechoslovakia.... huh
Pewds, Czechoslovakia split up a long time ago, how frickin old is that honey?
Ok, I loved this series, but it became pointless when Sven’s bf died and he lost his mind.
i miss the time when the animal doesnt make creepy sounds when talking to pewd
This fight can’t be a actual thing from mojang haha. This whole fight against causal of water sheep and a demonic water sheep feels like a extremely weird puff puff trip. If this is a actual thing then I love mojang more than ever
Ultimate
What’s up?<br><b>dies on inside and remembers</b> IKEA Tower!!!!!!!!!
I love how deranged he gets while the series progresses. Thats character development!! 👏👏
Anyone rewatching this is a legend also gato
the water sheep in the boss fight wasn&#39;t rainbow, or named jebb, so its not the real water sheep
I don’t understand the noises I have confusion and will never watch this series again
This dude continues to shock me with his creative mind the deeper I get into this series

Felix be like:<br>Water Sheep:he was like a father to me<br>The creeper:he was like the father to me<br>All the things:he was like father to me
We love czech representation
Czechoslovakia ended at 1993. I know it bcs I am Czech
Felix starts off the video by finishing his new house. Afterwards, he creates an infinite egg dispenser at Ingvar and makes a piston door and lighting system for his basement. He finds a blue sheep on the edge of his base, which tells him he needs to do the ancient ritual to bring back Council of Water Sheep. They go on top of the meatball, and Pewds flies away, a lead attached to the sheep. But he dies. Then he flies to IKEA Tower to find another sacrificial sheep. At IKEA Tower, there is a white sheep. He attaches a lead to that sheep. But it breaks while Pewds is flying down. He then flies back up and punches the sheep off of IKEA Tower, causing that sheep to die of severe fall damage. Later, he finds another sacrificial sheep and does that the same thing he did to kill Water Sheep. This summons Water Sheep, and Water Sheep battles him, ultimately killing him. After the battle is done, he get three things (which all look like carrots on sticks); Rainbow trail, which leaves a trail of wool behind Pewds when he walks; Wool-ring, which does damage to all mobs around Pewds in a certain radius (diamond pickaxes get thrown in the air, too); and Meatball Nuke, which does a big explosion around Pewds, even killing himself. He returns back to his his base and he goes to Water Sheep&#39;s church, and sure enough, Council of Water Sheep is back
His house was flooding, but he couldn&#39;t not play Minecraft.<br>GAMER RESPECT!
how many health does the sheep even have
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=440">7:20</a><br>Chicken-pocalypse

CZECHOSLOVAKIA!!!!!
Why is pewdiepie concerned with bringing back counsel of water sheep? He literally killed them.
Why does this feel like a filler episode?👁👄👁
U WANT PEWDS MAKE A SKY CITY
Why does PewDiePie import from Czechoslovakia? Maybe because we are the best, after Sweden
/kill @e[type=minecraft:chiken]
imagine still saying Czechoslovakia instead of Czech AND Slovakia
Pewds you can hold fireworks in your off-hand and if you charge a crossbow with fireworks in you off hand you will be able to shoot fireworks
How ,what??
Pewdiepie using comparators to delay a signal for his secret door<br>Repeater: <b>am I a joke to you?</b>
When Water Sheep Council said, “woiwoiwoiwoi woiwoiowiowio”<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>That hit me on a personal level
Wait where is the farmers and ulla brita and llama of tower AND THE FRICK CHAMBER AND THE POLAR BEAR THEY ARE STILL MISSING
wait a minute the second pewds resumed the game you can see the lan world option not acceseble so he used cheats to do something
Felix after launching Ikea tower to space: Never talks about it again
this vid was made a year ago today
I think Water sheep/jeb_ is the strongest boss ever..!
Looks like water sheep learnt a few things while he was stuck there
This is like the revenge of the sith, the good one became bad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=300">5:00</a> big brain moment

Chickens can make children two was egg and kiss y?
Anyone else realize how he started loosing views on the series since he started “friking” animals..?
Everybody Gangsta until the Water sheep spawns.

I was aad in the last epsoide
Subtitles say council of water sheep is council of authorship!

Why the hell your Minecraft dog has emotions?
Hello 👋
Bring watersheep back
You are a noob
You can make machine guns but you   cannot hold and move them you can put 4 dispensers and connect them to 4 repeaters in a circle connect the repeaters to a lever give it a pulse even shorter than a button and the dispensers will fire forever using arrows will be cool
Pewdiepie you can make torts for this is a liver to create a b or sleever unique of stone underneath towards unitop and you&#39;re done making also in the crafting table
are ya mumbo jumbo???
L

PewDiePie ur the best YT ever
Just when I thought there was peace in this playthrough, Council of Watersheep was mentioned 😔.<br><br><br>P.S.:- This is my favourite anime. I think it even surpasses all the mainstream animes.

Great!!!!
I’m so confused how he was blown up with 10 xp then got home with 56 xp...
Poor Pewdipie when Sven doesn’t look at him!
Watersjeep story arch so far- <br><br> watersjeep suffered throughout his life he was like jeasus in a way...... later on people realized that he was infact a holy being. A council of watersheep emerged as 3 mysterious watersheeps were found in the temple of watersheep (2 yellow an 1 blue). However a red watersheep infiltrates their rankes as the blue watersheep gies missing. The red watersheep conspires with the watersheep council an influenced pewdiepie to commit crimes like killing seven&#39;s b.f..... pewdipie realizes his falut  an goes off to lice in a far away land where he finds a new friend feigi the chicken. At first pewds suspects feigi but later on they become friends but as it turns out feigi was indeed an assassin sent by the council of watesheep to kill pewdipie. Pewds defats feigi returns to broland and kills the current watersheep council an constitutes the beetroot council. However the bluewatersjeep returns an tells pewds to reinstate the watersjeep council an soo pewdipie removes the beetroot council defeats the vengful ghost of the original watersjeep and reinstates the a new council of watersjeep
Why is pewds covering his chin??!!! I’m getting bad memories

Where has Ulla Britta been lately?
Minecraft used to be so innocent
Rip water sheep
Felix playing for some months: <b>Become a redstone engineer</b><br>Me playing for decades: <b>Puts pressure plate infront of doors</b>

Final boss off mincraft water sheep
You killed the jesus sheep I-
I don&#39;t know how Marzia goes to bed with Felix knowing thaat he fricked a creeper
It’s like as if he started to have a double personality after playing Minecraft.
When watersheep is harder to beat then the ender dragon
WATERSHEEP = POWER OF GODS
Ouf
legit turned from an epic series, to a cult led by a sheep<br>LEZGO

Jätte smart chyklingar lyssna aldrig på Ingvar.
Bro u did all this in creative or survival
&quot;myam revyaw&quot;
Pewds summoned water sheep in a different world because at his base he was at 56 XP points and when he summoned water sheep he was at 10 XP points
Look fighting water sheep he has 10 levels, when he came back home after he defeat watersheep his levels became 56! Can someone EXPLAIN THIS
I ever experienced sheep chase me in Minecraft
OMG THEY MAKING MUSIC! MUSIC CHEKEN
Unlocked hidden memory: WAtER SheEp?
Those chickens r funky
Love how Watersheep used the clone jutsu lmao
Everybody keeps changing their voices.
Pewds: SVEN! Don&#39;t ever touch that creeper!<br><br><br>Me: But he&#39;s immune...
We need a Pewdiepie, Jacksepticye and Markiplier collab
Since the death of water sheep he has never been the same again
Wait a sec...in the last episode...Felix launched the old ikea tower to the sky USING LOADS OF <b>HONEY</b> BLOCKS and slime blocks, but then now he doesn’t even know how to get honey...🤔HOW DID YOU FORGET? It’s been five months. <b>five</b>
thank god this wasnt minecraft hardcore
Me watching full series again and bruh i was drinking milk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=538">8:58</a> and now my shirt is wet lol
Pewdiepie id this in real minecraft
Did Felix say fucking bitch in the mercy plug?
Pewds:Fake watersheep<br>Also Pewds:I love u like a father
Its funny that pewds doesnt use any of the acual stuff that he got.
I wonder how his father feels when Felix calls all these fake animals his fathers? Lmao
Did anyone else notice that the council of water sheeps colors were reversed?  The yellow one is in the middle now and the blue ones are to the side of him, but the blue sheep used to be in the middle and the yellow sheep were to the side.
The chickens have synchronized flaps lmaooo 😂
Beyoureself and never surrender<br>Pewdipie is my idol
ikea tower is now ikea space ship
Felix are you okay. I am genuinely concerned
Czechoslovakia 😑 It&#39;s czech republic or slovakia.
I really want to be a member, but it costs money.
Can&#39;t even understand the language!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=2">0:02</a>
He said cyca blyat mean fing botch but me no swore

I always thought Felix lived in Minecraft but it turns out it was just a green screen. 😪
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=463">7:43</a> disgusting sounds,the sounds like a poop💩
PewDiePie: look now the basement is lit tell me wat u think<br>Me: it LIT 😂
Skykia tower
PewDiePie then: whats this red stuff?<br><br>PewDiePie now:..........
When pewdiepie mentioned czekoslovakia<br>Every slovak and czech mind:💥💥💥💥😱😱😱💥💥🤣<br>(im slovak)
His editing is like the funny aspects of the older Garry&#39;s Mod comedy videos 😆<br>Look up GMOD Idiot Box Episode 9 by DasBoSchitt
Wotr Sjep fljoiided pewds house I’m sure of it
He’s slowly going insane
Me yelling at the screen: &quot;WATERSHEEEP KILL HIM&quot;
I feel like every time I watch pewdiepie play Minecraft, I take a college course in red stone.

This series has gotten a little worse not gonna lie
U could have just udsed a repeater for the opening floor
You can make manga out of this and it&#39;s still will be good series
I fucking love this series and I dont care if Felix cheats, but cmon. I doubt he could build like that in this first year of minecraft. Sometime when he builds and does a jumpcut you see single blocks in this hotbar, which suggests he was in creative. But idc this series is hilarious. Best minecraft letsplay ever. We need more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=825">13:45</a> a seconds away from watersheeps death
We need more main character boss battles like so he can see
No Czechoslovakia czech republic And Slovakia two country
love how his accent comes out when he goes insane about something
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=825">13:45</a> 😳😳😳

Me: <b>obsessed with cacti</b><br>Pewds: “I made so much cactus”<br>Me: HA HA HA HA HA I LOVE THIS SERIES
Give an Anime Opening and this series will be an anime for sure

Who is from checkoslovakia like👍
No offense, but how could you build the roller coaster and the the meatball with your incredibly big-brain, but you had trouble with a simple trapdoor?
Does anyone know where he got these sound effects for the animals
long live water sheep
it&#39;s my b-day thank you for doing what you doing pewdiepie
Gamer moment
Since when does watersheep know shadow clone jutsu?
Pewdiepie cheated on<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CACTUS !!!
Pewdiepie is smart u know
its a love hate relationship. that sums up about this whole series
I heard the Mine cart song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=400">6:40</a> how do you make this!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=125">2:05</a> sounds like a knock off tardis.
This minecraft series become crepy
Is everyone just gonna ignore how pewdiepie did a perfect Russian accent in the beginning of the video?
Anyone else see how the creeper shot out of the ground
I&#39;m very curious now on how to set a tower stuck on the sky, I don&#39;t even know how red stones work to do that lmao
Hey dont you dare it&#39;s Rusia bad words
When pewdiepie finished his secret floor-door and saw the huge infestation of chickens I couldn’t stop laughing 😂 Im pretty sure we all saw it coming
Unsubscribe to t series
You have been granted an inch growth. Like to make it happen.
Божеееее cyka bluat

Fake water sheep did a Shadow Clone Jitsu on Pewdiepie
I frickin died when I saw all those darn chickens
The watersheep fight was set to easy.
floor gang FLOOOR GANG
this series started getting super weird at this point....
im still shook how the intro sounds like Boris&#39; intro from Life Of Boris wtf
Anyone else try to make the water shape and fail
Go back to the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=824">13:44</a> and listen carefully 😂👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=823">13:43</a> sounds like premarital hugging.
Quite literally a sacrificial lamb
everybody gangsta till pewdiepie teaches redstone
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=740">12:20</a>
I just realized that the water sheep council are different colors. It was two yellows not two blues
Sheep had a power cagibunshin tekinik like naruto
what has this series become
Always when the sheep fly he almost dies
Felix is turning into mumbo
Some technical gibberish starts form <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=304">5:04</a>
I thought that sven died
Slav comrade
Shouldn&#39;t water sheep be throwing tridents ?
Sven is like the son of a mafia boss and he doesn&#39;t want anyone to be hurt but whenever someone bullies him at school the bully and their family is never seen again.
Felix: This things use to be so painful, isnt that right sven<br><br><br>Me: Remembers what he did to watersheep..xD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=867">14:27</a><br>G O L D foreshadowing
The new series is getting weird
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=871">14:31</a> o no

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=176">2:56</a> So that&#39;s where all the chickens come from.
Damn <br>Pewdiepie is pro gamer <br>Hes so smart!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=244">4:04</a>  Ahhhh its Czech and Slovakia. We are not together anymore.

I’m watching a grown man lose sanity due to a rainbow sheep. Why.
Would you rather to sub or sub?
pewdiepie how the fuck did you summon that watersheep?????????? it doesnt work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The boss fight looks like the fight with Deacons of the Deep in Dark Souls 3
When he said “ah you snake” I had to pause the video to wheeze
Felix is actually so good at redstone. He makes his own machines and that&#39;s 😎
IK I’m kinda late but u can’t be too far from a 0 tick farm without turning it off first. Otherwise it will break
Did I just get taught Redstone pulse extenders by PewDiePie
Remember when he said he would never cut down the tree of life <br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m still mad
THE COLECTOR
I ❤️ Minecraft
Me: <b>from Czech Republic</b><br>Pewds: <b>mentions czechoslovakia</b><br>Me: OwO <b>fangirling</b>

it has come to a point when I don&#39;t understand if he&#39;s speaking russian, japanease, english, or swedish.
Can we just appreciate the mods people have been making for pewds !
I&#39;m still so confused whether if the Council of Watersheep is an ally or an enemy.
He uses two comparators<br><br>Sad mumbo jumbo noises
😅😅😅😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
He chicken beat
Here and now we are awarded to Felix / PewDiePie for finding the rarest , most dangerous and powerful boss in Minecraft: water sheep!!
i am 9 years old and i watch you anyways pewdiepie
Pewds yelling at the creepers and giving them voices is the same as when Sky used to talk to squids XD
Dang, Pewds is coming for Mumbo Jumbo&#39;s career
The chicken farm sounds like the background sounds from fnaf 2
How did you respawn with you tools and XP?
Water sheep vs pewdiepie
Watersheep is like naruto
PewDiePie‘s dog is going to die because every single dog you own in Minecraft dies
PLEASE TURN ON KEEP INVENTORY
Felix rivals mumbojumbo with his redstone knowledge
Who creates these mods lol
The chicken music that you heard i heard
Pewdiepie committed a transmutation circle and has revived something besides water sheep
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB4Q3ezW9fM&amp;t=437">7:17</a> I am infuriated at the fact that he missed the chance to say “look at all those chickens”
Czech-o-Slovakia doesn&#39;t exist anymore
me a Slavic/Czech:<br>pewds:  it&#39;s okay I imported it from Czechoslovakia<br>me: I have been recognized to the fullest of my extent
Why does his new house look like a barn
