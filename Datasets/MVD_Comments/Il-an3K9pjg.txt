When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤🎉

I will always remember<br>The day you kissed my lips<br>Light as a feather<br>And it went just like this<br>No, it&#39;s never been better<br>Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)<br>Mm, we were only 11<br>But acting like grown-ups<br>Like we are in the present<br>Drinking from plastic cups<br>Singing, &quot;Love is forever and ever&quot;<br>Well, I guess that was true (ooh)<br>Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>Songs with all our childhood friends<br>And it went like this, say<br>Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>Paint a picture for you and me<br>Of the days when we were young, uh<br>Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>Now we&#39;re under the covers<br>Fast forward to 18<br>We are more than lovers<br>Yeah, we are all we need<br>When we&#39;re holding each other<br>I&#39;m taken back to 2002 (ooh)<br>Yeah<br>Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>Songs with all our childhood friends<br>And it went like this, say<br>Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>Paint a picture for you and me<br>Of the days when we were young, uh<br>Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br>On the day we fell in love<br>Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br>On the day we fell in love, love, love

My tears in my eyewhen I relate to the song, especially the origin of everything hehe, it&#39;s like back then, but there are memories left behind
So many 1990 music and band reference here, Britney, N&#39;sync, etc... reminds me MVC of Blink 182 All the small things :)

I&#39;ve knew this song since I was eight, I thought when I would be eleven. Time just went to quick though. I&#39;m 11 now 😥 ill be twelve in 4 months. How fast we grow up ✨💜
I have been listening to this song constantly for the past 4 years, but sadly Anne Marie remembers her childhood friend but my childhood friend doesn&#39;t remember me. I was 11 then, she, me and her lips are so painful,,,, she forgets me.  I could not forget, my childhood friend.
I&#39;m in 2024

I was sentenced to this kind of dimension and subjected to evil and humiliating procedures after the souls and dimension lives they stole a long time ago. And this goes back a long time. Most of the people in the dimension may be copies. And manipulated forms. Why am I in this kind of dimension? And it&#39;s nice. Am I being exposed to unnecessary transactions?
Anyone in 2024? Who is still obsessed with this masterpiece?
