His voice doesnt match his face 😭
Brilliant...🇿🇦
Underground 6 is my favourite movie and money heist is the favourite series
We need 6 Underground 2!!😍
is this a spin off?
Professor speaking English?!
I live in Spain, munis the S
Is this real and true
Oh so this is different movie well if it comes on December hope Professor does come and work together with him #1
Anyone here from watching his brother Moses the jeweler?
Professor sounds weird because I watched the English dub, would have been nice to have the English dubbed professor, his voice is... Idk
So whatever happened to this crossover that was supposed to happen? But never happened?
little does he know, tokyo ded
Hints...soft Bank...😀
A Michael Bay Produced
At least he didn&#39;t choose Rio
I&#39;d have dinner with him too.
Damn the professor is pretty fluent in English and sounds bad ass
The voice of him in the dubbed English version was the perfect voice of the character
Was it just me or did everyone else at first think it was gonna be one big collab movie/series?
when ryan reynolds says jesus christ whe<br>n he gets angry he thinks a lot about him
Greatest crossover in history
&quot;I&#39;ve come to barg.... Oh sht wrong movie.&quot;
Rayn as Deadpool or what 🤔
@Netflix India Are we going to see Money Heist season 6? If yes, when?
What is this😐😐😐
So does this mean that 6 underground and money heist are in the same universe?
its 0034 ryan, your welcome
This should be a real thing
They should team up
they, need to do a duo movie.
Oh is.. is this real I thought this was a fanmade 🤔😲
I find it interesting to imagine these two shows share a universe

So, in the end, it never happened on the series at all
Ok same drill sting
There are cameras everywhere
The police are actually working for him😂😂😂
Professor -  “sorry dead”
Where do I watch this
We all need season 6 but we understand why there won&#39;t be another season because it will not be the same since Tokyo and Nairobi won&#39;t be there💔

“…not to mention pri-tee BALL-zee”
Man, why is the Professor&#39;s English so good? He sounds nearly like a native speaker from England.
Berlin for the win.

So far 6 underground, and watchdogs: legion are cannon in the money heist universe
I HATE YOUTUBE! FIX YOUR GODDAMN ALGORITHIM! WHY AM I JUST SEEING THIS??? I THOUGHT IT WAS NEW!
Professor&#39;s Spanish is listening like Boss
Professor predicted that I would take part in the comments section so he didn&#39;t reply back to anyone because !!!!!! <br>       You Finnish the sentence
I wish Mint was available in Spain
Best cross-over
I am so mad this crossover never officialy happened, netflix i hate u but i also love u very much, our relationship is complicated netflix hsbzhdbx
hää its mean new film ore somthing????????
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=51">0:51</a>, the best part
Looks like Ryan’s only getting one of the proffessors ppl now🤣
What if they crossover 👀😲 u never know these days 🤔
😳😳😳😳
Please don&#39;t give me hope
Okay, so he called straight to his line...
Little did they know
Repent to Jesus Christ <br>“Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.”<br>‭‭Matthew‬ ‭3:8‬ ‭NIV‬‬<br>J
just love how Ryan Reynolds just pops up everywhere as himself or deadpool.
movie name
I GOT IT BAD FOR THE PROFESSOR 😩🙏🏽
Is this actually a movie?
Goooooddd!!! I LOVE RYAN REYNOLDS AND THE PROFESSOR ❤️❤️❤️
Part 2?????????????
A bad movie and a stupid series, why am i not surprised.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=50">0:50</a> his laugh lol 💘
Noooo why they have the Proffessor speaking Engligh
Amazed, the worst English that i heard it&#39;s from the people of spain
tokyo is dead🙂
Movies and series has almost no quality anymore, its only braindead scripts, what happend to the real movies ? not some franchise that rides on a name. Ryan need to learn some more acting in my oppinion the guy is playing the same role as he always does, some dumb wierd cocky guy,
Filipino adopted Spanish language
omg ima sub to you now tyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ผ่านไป 2 ปียังทำหนังยังไม่เสร็จหรอ 55555
Proffesor will die as the only man in history that rejected Ryan Reynolds
Tokyo and Denver 😍🥰😀
here after watching season 5 lmao
Is this real, I&#39;m confused
No entiendo de que va esto
Tokyo and Denver<br>- No problem<br>-Really?<br>- Yeah, but Tokyo is dead AF m8...
[Joke with spoilers]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Good luck with getting Tokyo thing
Oh right, I need Money Heist x 6 Underground x Fast and Furious x Avengers team up to rob another bank.
Bruh, Tokyo is dead
Didn&#39;t Tokyo die
the professor and berlin should have do more movies.. that proffesor so sexy
Álvaro Morte is just the dreamiest ever 😍
Wait, I thought this is an upcoming movie. The joy I felt.
Why would they merge a trashterpiece with a masterpiece?
Unfortunately, I can‘t give you Tokio… she‘s gone
That’s a different voice over for the Professor than the one used in the Netflix series
Denver&#39;s laugh~~~~~
Tokyo cant help you anymore
So this for real I am confused 😕 for season 6 mix together underground and money Heist.?
why on earth would he want tokyo and denver 😭😭
D-did Álvaro Morte get to tell Ryan Freaking Reynolds to piss off?<br><br>Living legend! lol
which season is this
Still waiting for a crossover
Great video even if The Professor speaking English hits weird lol
Is this not a real movie 🥲? Are they actually doing a crossover?
awsome i am waiting <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>
For a spanish, Professor speaks English quite well!,
New season is coming?
Please keep the Professor attitude as same before in money heist. He has the deepest attitude &amp; it perfectly suits with this character.
If you had to pick two for your heist, who would you choose?  I’d pick Nairobi for heart and reliability and maybe Berlin for brains.  Tokyo is great but impulsive…
So is this not real??
no Tokyo anymore :(
Let&#39;s go
Why not Berlin ! Stupid :(
wait huhh is this like a movie
If he can speak brilliant English like that then he should’ve been his own voiceover for Netflix English audio lol. I’m sorry but I refuse to believe Todd Haberkorn was the British voice of the professor. He sounds nothing like it. I appreciate he puts voices on but the English audio voice for the professor was completely different to Todd. There’s no footage online of him doing the voice either
Netflix is the only guy who can promote two different things at once , this time it’s a movie and a series….
Okay why am I just seeing this😅😅
“Is it zero, zero one, or Jesus Christ”? …… you hollywood people are always blaspheming the lord’s name ‼️ I’ve noticed, he notices, shame on you 🤦🏽‍♂️
Aahhh i hope this kind of collaboration happens🤩
I want this to be a movie so bad.
Who&#39;s fev Arturito 😂
One asked for the most useless members of the gang. No wonder Proff agreed so easily lol
Funny how this seen never came in part 5
My 2 favorite things on Netflix and somehow I barley see this
If i got to choose one, definitely Denver. I just wanna hear his golden laugh.
Professor&#39;s English was Soo high-class like I thought it would be! He was just as intimidating and stylish as he is speaking Spanish!
I&#39;ve only listened to The Professor&#39;s actual spanish voice and english dub voice. Listening to his actual english voice, it feels weird.
I thought this was part of the series
Comon quickly movie nikalo
omg his English voice omgggggggggg
I would choose Berlin in a heartbeat.
Sadly, Tokyo’s dead so you can’t have her 😔
i still cant believe this.............
If season 5 didn&#39;t go the way it did, then this would&#39;ve been great to see!
😂💥
No mames.. that ryan dude is annoying af neta.. they would fck the whole show up with that guy in it..
Where and when
I&#39;d suggest Berlin and Tokyo and in six underground four and the doctor idk her number Incase anyone got shot in lacasadepapel
&quot;by the way , did you see the tits on table twelve?&quot;
Lol their are no 6 underground in money heist vol. 2
I would be head over heels to see a cross-over between money heist and hitman&#39;s bodyguard, btw...
All seriousness. Why on the glorious earth Ryan acts a different character, he is still Deadpool?<br><br>Different character, different name, yet the same personality even the way he speaks!
I can hear Professor speaking for hours! He has got such a good voice, damn😩 Whether it&#39;s English or Spanish he speaks, his voice is loveeeeeeeee &lt;3
Imagine this was an actual show 😀
Who’s here after the last season of Money Heist and wishes for  a movie like this with Ryan Reynolds involved?
wow
This English voice actor was fine but I feel like the English actor for the real show is a better fit.
After watching money heist i came back to watch this lol
Looking back.  They need to do a cross over
Money Heist (La Casa De Papel) ---&gt; 💰🏆🥇<br><br>6 Underground ---&gt; 👎👎👎<br>💩💩💩🚮
Is not even close Money Heist, even if you only showed one 5 episodes, is far superior to 6 underground. <br>Me and my friends tried to watch it because it had Ryan Reynolds but it was embarrassingly bad we stopped 25% in the movie.
We need this cross over desperately
Is this even real netflix answer me
People sound insanely different when they speak a different language
I love
💯😎👊👌
He just basically ask for 2 of proffesors best people.
I hate to ask. But.. lol is the edited
From : Rollins with the heist of the century<br>To : Professor with the heist of the ages<br>We all grew up
I think Ryan&#39;s Team is more better than Professor&#39;s Team...<br>😁😁😁
M watching this on loop😁😁😁
so this scene for season 5 right?
Alvaro Mortes Voice is similar to his Tamil dubbed voice Of Money Heist
Wait what??! There’s a spin off with money heist and underground x?!! And Alvaro speaks English??
Koi samjha ke nhi<br>Iska mtlb he Denver bhi marega S05 me
ok now that Ryan Reynolds is in  show...aaalot more ppl gonna start watching
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
😶😶😶😮😮😮😯😯😯😯😲😲😲😲😲 that&#39;s some epic awesome cross over or collaboration...shhiiiii😱😱😱😱😱michael bay😏ddddeeeeeeyyyyymmm
i think tokyo not with you
Bruh denvers laughing in English is just pure embarrassment 💀💀
What if dead pool was in the money heist
6 underground was so freaking awesome
we need more crossovers
Only Professor can make Deadpool plea like 3rd grade kid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=82">1:22</a><br>Keep Dreaming..😎<br>The Savage One..🤓
SO FUNNY!!
But tokyo is a dead meat .
But tokyo is dead?
That deal is probably just an excuse to ask professor out
Is it real 🙁🙁🙁
Tokyo died
Out of all, top 5 pick: Marseille, Lisbon, Bogota, Nairobi, Moscow.  You would not want to work with Tokyo.
After one year 😐
To live this scene I&#39;m gonna watch 6 undergrounds again🔥
kinda milking the show now huh?
This is so damn cool.
Wait he can speak English🤖🤖🤖🤖
Imagine all the Netflix originals having a cross over
Tokyo is to selfish and stubborn and thats why she ruins all fucking heist
what movie is that ?
Tokyo is dead..
OMG!!!!!!!!! I love them both and this clip is life!!!
Ryan <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Rf90XtDbG8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Rf90XtDbG8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Rf90XtDbG8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Rf90XtDbG8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a>
Professor needs hitman&#39;s bodyguard 😂😂
Money Heist is a ridiculous series lost interest after Season 1
Soooooo it’s official Ryan Reynolds has become another Will smith or Mark Wahlberg, can’t play other than themselves.
The false familiar famous blow parenthetically soothe because wrist electrophysiologically fold outside a probable hate. normal, barbarous visitor
Seriously?? Tokyo?? You should have gone for Nairobi... Shez dupe! But Hell No... Not Tokyo
Man this movie sucked ass. I don&#39;t remember anything about it
OMG!! Hope there is a collab!!!
Tokyo is dead MF
Spoiler:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Tokyo is dead
Damn you, Netflix. You had me going there for a moment actually hoping and believing that these two worlds are going to collide and crossover.
Tokyo dead as hell
Tokyo is gonna screw up your plan, i tell ya.
tokyo will is going to make ryan&#39;s plans look usless
This is how you do marketing. lol
That could have gone better if he had asked for Berlin and Nairobi
damnnn bro
😆😆😆
Make this real
Which episode  was this?
I demand a cross over mini series at least a solid 45 min short, something.
RIP Tokyo
Is this part of the show or the movie?
Cringe level has been squared or cubed even
Q hace Ryan ahí????
A Crossover no one asked for but everyone needed. YES!
ok tbh in performance berlin stands tall among all co-actors. And director should need to kill arturo, they need a separate series to hunt that !#$#@$@
mira ese crossover papa
Lmao😂 now this is hilarious!!
2019:<br>reynolds: needs tokyo and denver<br>2021:<br>also reynolds: not stonks..
lol nicely done..
Hearing the professor speak in English is blowing my mind atm.
We Beg you 😭🙏🙏🙏 Never Stop Money Heist , let Hundreds of parts Come , 🙏😭 please don&#39;t stop this Series , it had became a Drug fr me to ÀlvZ watch ur series , I personally ready to pay how much ever u demand for this series , if u want keep separate charges for this series 😭 but please never stop &quot;MONEY HEIST&quot;
THIS IS THE REAL PROFFESORS VOICE??? Sounds so much better than the dub lol
So is Tokyo alive ????
LOL I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MEME LET GOOOOO
Omg!!! Yall be holding out on me
Cringe af
Noch mehr so Müll und ihr bekommt ne Sperre ! 🤮🤮🤮🤮
How am I only coming across this now this was back in 2019?!?! They should make this a regular Netflix promo different scenes every time just randomly pop up on YouTube.
Smh
Tense
I&#39;d pay 100$ to see this 😂<br><br>And I hope people know that&#39;s not even the actual words or voice of the Professor. <br><br>But still golden 😂
Why is the professor&#39;s English conversion sound so cool in this
ryan reynolds is for comedy show🍌
Fair Trade
wait, Ryan Reynod really join in this series?
This is never coming out.
😍😍😍😍😍
Ok this is how people should do ads because 1 film and 1 tv series are promoted in just one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=105">1:45</a> min ad. That&#39;s 🆒
It&#39;s fak
OMG😭
Why was the professors voice different to the dubbed voice on Netflix? Am I missing something?
🤩🤩
mega cringe
Keep dreaming............

💙🖤❤️
Can some one get me Tokyo&#39;s phone number i am always in love with her in my dreams
tokyo? but tokyo is-
Not Denver &amp; Tokyo they&#39;re the worst u could ever have 🤣🤦

No inglesh with la casa ples just Spain
so he wants the two guys out of the group that combined dont even get to average IQ?
Denver 🥰🥰🥰🥰
still have not watched this movie
Oo bloody I love the concept ...
Welp Netflix is right once again. Never asked for this but I needed this
why killed TOKYO, she is soul of Money Heist.........
The wrong music endogenously extend because kettle surprisingly rescue like a nosy sky. dapper, stingy asparagus
How about a crossover? Hmmm
is this real? when is it coming out?
Not good as professors tamil voice
is there going to be a sequel netflix?
6 underground on of the best movie
So which season is this since Tokyo is dead and I&#39;ve not come across this clip on money heist
They should’ve collaborate this 2 badass before they kill Tokyo 😢
Here after Tokyo got nuke
My world has collided 🤯🤯
Professor turning down Ryan Reynolds&#39; dinner proposal is just heartbreaking.
Tokyo huh? well this didn&#39;t age well...
Que le avisen que tokyo no va a llegar
crossover I never asked for
What a swap in netflix universe 😂
TOKYOO DIDN&#39;T DIEEEEEE SHE IS WITH THE TEAAMMMMM
While Le Casa de La Papel (Money Heist) is a great TV series, Underground 6 is just horrible in comparison
Tokyo is dead 🤨
well.... tyoko is dead
Asshold
why no find in uk
Tokyo... :) :(
Not denver..no...i love when he lough....a a a a a a a a a
Hey look, its Rynal Reynolds
Is Netflix India filled with liberandu morons?
A circus clown meets a genius intellectual.
Unfortunately Tokyo is dead so no deal ??
Gosh I wish they used the real actors voice for the dubbed English. Although I’ve actually grown quite fond of it.
Can we get like a Netflix Universe with all these tv series and movies that Netflix has been giving us? Much like Marvel and DC Universe. The crossovers would be awesome!
ikkos; biz boyle seyleri sevmiyoruz
So... Underground and Money Heist are both cannon?
Professor is law Tokyo is luffy
Spoiler Life is Strange and this video have a lot in common like mr Jefferson is the professor
Dammit why is it youtube recommended this me now?..it should&#39;ve been sooner than later..
Kids: Tokyo<br>Men: Nairobi<br>Legends: Berlin<br>Ultra-Legends: Arturo
Cute
The workable peanut subsequently command because t-shirt sequentially admire along a mundane rainbow. spotted, boundless hedge
bs...
Why am I just watching this? Btw is this scene for real? I&#39;ve watched Underground 6 last year and just gotten into Money Heist by now, I don&#39;t remember on U6 they have this scene
Tokio is dead
Acabo de verlo recien y tokio esta fria fria
Denver my favourite 🔥🔥
Professore. Parla benissimo l&#39;inglese.
This is one of the reasons why I’m still hoping that Tokyo will return and did not really died.
2019 WHY I&#39;M SEEING THIS NOW!? xD
This is Ryan Reynolds 6 underground movie
now, he will not get tokio in this life
this would be bad ass
is this still goin to happen?
Tokiyo is dead that will be difficult
Sadly its comfirmed that 6 underground wont have a sequel
Tokyo is dead
Goddamn! This is making me crazy.
La casa de papel is such a good show that it has become an international sensation, not an easy feat by any standard
This movie was hot garbage
He can take Arturo as a bonus.
Ryan Reynolds can&#39;t play any other role, only the role of Ryan Reynolds. I&#39;m starting to feel like he&#39;s a bad actor.
Please dub the defender web series in hindi please
ப்ரொஃபஸர் எல்லாம் வேண்டாம் வேஸ்ட் <br>நம்ம ஆளு ஒருத்தர் இருக்காரு வேணும்னா ரெகமெண்ட் பண்ணட்டுமா 🙄
Is he calling someone portraying Huge Jackedman?
of course the profesor give you his worst mercenary because they only know destroy plans, they never follow a freaking plan.
Si Tokio ya está muerta, ¿A quien se llevará 1?
Ryan and Tokyo!. If only netflix could make it happen
Ryan, any of his characters, Deadpool... Lines are getting blurry.
Money Heist one of the most overrated series of all times, mediocre acting and plot full of cliches and concepts taken from others movies and series, the success show how basic and easy are viewers right now.
Professor love from india
Le montage est très bien fait 🤣
We need this!!!!!!
How did I only see this now?? This is amazing xD
Denver&#39;s A A A A A 🤣🤣🤣🤣
One aint gettin tokyo thats for sure lol
what you ask for is&#39;nt available right at the moment!
Where is minnal murali trailer.. 😡😡
O M G....!
Omggggg
?? tokio is dead right?
PLEASE MAKE THIS CROSSOVER!
I literally can&#39;t see Ryan Reynolds&#39; character other than Deadpool. To me, this is Deadpool talking 😂
Tokyo died though?
This was promotional video of Movie 6 Underground and La Casa De Papel show which was released in 2019 this an old video
I thought he met professor X
Waitttt is this real…..
Oh my god.
Tokyo is dead in SEASON 4 !!!!!!!!<br><br>And yeah..it is such a shitty show
🔥🔥🔥
How about Gandia, Deadpool?
more netflixverse
I MISS TOKYO 😢 😕 😞
I’m hearing Deadpool talking to the Professor
this is one crossover that ill pay some money to watch
Is this real ???
If u ever gonna heist then do not allow couple in your team
Tokyo Dead =D
Tokyo dies
Rip Tokyo
Professor: Who do you want?<br>One: Tokyo and...<br>Professor: (Sneezing) Choose another please
guess i need to watch money heist now?
who is here after season 5 part 1?
Need this collab 🔥
Denver : AA. AA. AA. AA. AA
Imagine in the final episode Ryan&#39;s team comes and helps them escape
I hate it when the description steals my comment that I would never have thought of
I love this video so much
Bruhh tokyo is dead
Huh, I have no idea what this is or what has come of it but it sounds cool.
Wait this isn&#39;t real
Uf no puedo esperar
Por qué nunca había visto esto?
The shut milkshake anteriorly taste because latex normally unpack behind a heavenly heavy hellish trade. oceanic, innocent laundry
:))
so this actually happened?
Beauuuuuuutiful!
But Tokyo is dead
Even ThugLife Deadpool asking for help from our professor ~ Professor Supremacy🔥
why was this video even made its not making any sense now tokyo is dead , and denver well he is still alive i dont understand this videos
Somebody tell ONE Tokyo is no more 😭
Imagine a kingdom hearts-style netflix crossover where characters from some of their best shows share a universe
Professor should call rayan Reynolds in volume 2
Helsinki could be much serious to him 😋 ......
Undoubtedly Season 5.1 rocks. However, i found that: Hypocritical, two-faced people are leading actors in this drama. They show us The Salvador Dalí masks which is the symbol of Resistance and on the other hand they praise apartheid Israel - the illegal state of the world.  @/free PALESTINE
Helsinki and Nairobi are better options
That would be one epic crossover in Netflix history
Not even the Suicide Squad would want Tokyo
un estadounidense hablando con un español en un canal indio
1 and his crew are so good that i dont even remember what they did in their movie
Ryan can&#39;t have Tokyo now 😭
Professor - You&#39;ve never helped me. Not once.<br>Ryan - You never asked <br>Professor - 😶
tokyo dies season 5 so....
wait, they already made a deal for Tokyo and Denver, but in final eps season 5 part 1 we saw tokyo blowing up with a lot of bombs, so? is Tokyo still alive?
The half son resultantly behave because effect congruently bolt beneath a military bulb. available, changeable hand
I just can&#39;t wait.
Woaaa
Tokyo is kinda ummm
best colab ever?
Arter a year Tokio is dead and we’ll never get a sequel of 6 underground.
what is this
is this actually real?
so tokyo is dead
so the keep dreaming part was real
lol this just so awesome
Tokyo is already dead
meme that says: pufff (blow mind), right?
RIP tokyo
Tokio is dead 😭😭😭
I hate Tokyo...but she is Cute .<br>I Hate Arturu also..<br>If i was a director believe me i would have killed him in 1st episode of Season 1 in first 2 mints ....Grrrr
Watching it over and over still funny 😁 🤣
well... tokio is a problem now hahaha impossible  to do, number <br>ONE
Wow,this could be fun
your job offers increase when you speak more languages, I&#39;m so happy for him and Ursula.
tokyo not die????
but Tokio is dead LOL
the professor speaks english??!!
you can&#39;t borrow Tokyo anymore because she&#39;s ....
Tokyo is dead tho
:0
if janice form friends and denver were put in the same room...🤡
Didn&#39;t Tokio die?
This needs to become a reality where they team up or something. I would 100% watch that
La Casa de Papel&#39;
Why am I just know finding this
only for this i want to watch that stupid show (la casa de papel) but i really want to see 6 underground!
wow
No , Noone needed also better add that to ur nasty stupid description ur mind games ain&#39;t and aren&#39;t working here. surry
I don&#39;t know what you think but Alvaro Morte is slowly becoming the new Robert Downey Jr. imo. And that gives me chills and serotonin.
tokyo died........
SPOILER<br><br><br><br><br>Rio is going to work for Number one confirmed
hold up tokyo is dead
Tokyo dies
when you saw that tokyo is dead XD
XD KEEP DREAMING ! :D
They should definitley do this. &quot;NETFLIX CINEMATIC UNIVERSE&quot;.<br><br>Maybe, on Six Underground 2, Professor will show up, help them in a certain part of the mission together with Helsinki or Marseille. 🔥 Its gonna be Epic!
Denver laugh..😂😂😂😂😍😍
This actor should be in a Hollywood movie!
Why is this not really happening 😡
YES. YES. YES.
This was real ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=70">1:10</a> Professor in mind : ya i know
Is this a show?
IM STILL WATING FOR THIS TWO IMBECILS TO TEAM UP
Need in relugu
The perfect octave recurrently cover because surprise reassuringly produce since a clean closet. stingy, narrow cemetery

I love this so much.
Soundtrack??
Its good they didnt make the deal Now Because.....Yea (dont give spoilers in replies btw)Ik i am late Lmao
R.I.P. TOKYO
I mean why money heist is so over hyped ? Its characters never behave like real person...
I just watched season 5 and I’m pissed
You know what, One? Tokyo is dead, so you can&#39;t have her. Unless you want her dead body, oh, and only if it&#39;s intac btw. (because she died with 4 grenades in her chest) think about it. <br>Or, you can consider Bogota.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we must call a substitute for Tokyo for the time being
Professor voice super 🔥
Imagine vol.II Ryan Reynolds team helping professor team
Cuz four he does parkour so why doesn&#39;t need four and seven is a army person so what is going to happen next no one knows
So for the next mission why do they need four and seven so once they&#39;re done with robbing the gold where are they going next
Four four and seven in money heist that is like an epic crossover
Six underground is an awesome movie if you haven&#39;t seen it and now we know that they&#39;re both in the same universe as money heist
Please tell me in volume 2 season 6 they&#39;re going to have a crossover
we need a crossover !!1
RIP Tokyo
Does that confirm that they&#39;re set in the same universe???
Is alvaro morte spoke really
Tokyo R.I.P
Tokyo..Tokyo...Tokyo... Tokyo... died😭😭😭😭😭...Gandia tooo....<br>Greatest spoiler of 21st century..😀😀😀
Ryan Reynolds  has to ruin destroy money heist sad faceeeee
cringe
just love how Ryan Reynolds just pops up everywhere as himself or deadpool.
right, so Tokyo-
kinda wish there was a second movie of this
:)))
Kids: Tokyo<br>Men: Nairobi<br>Legends: Berlin
Well number one, you can&#39;t take Tokyo because she&#39;s... Nevermind.
He can&#39;t have Tokio she explode herself with Gandia LOL RYAN U GOOD ?
The insidious glove overwhelmingly handle because van formerly rescue among a keen germany. irate, hateful distributor
This is why I think Tokyo is still alive!
Plot twist
There might be a slight issue with the plan now...
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well well well. :(
This is pretty cool wow.
Remember when there were no transgenders in money heist 😂
I am a Berlin fan!
what is this?
Rest In Peace Tokyo :(
Yes!
Professor after season 5: Yeah, about that...
What if this is Plan Rome💥
After watching the 1st part of season 5, we all know Ryan Reynolds wont get 1 of who he was asking from the professor :&#39;(
dam number one got scammed
IM STILL WAITING FOR THE CROSSOVER
Is this fan made or real??
tokyo is  so useless and netflix knows it... the only clips they showed of her is her being hot while the others got cool fighting montages lol
april of course ...
Not going to get Tokyo biatchhhh!
Tokyo is dead mfs no 6underground x money heist, dont dream they are just playin withasss sense like a heist of views xd
Ryan clearly isn’t up to speed with the new season, wanting Tokyo on his team.
3/12/21????
m just wondering what happened to this collaboration ?????
i need this to be real
Wrong room, sorry guys I was suppose to be in the stranger things room. I’ll leave now.
Is it season 5🤔🤔🤔 ?
plz make a movie with underground 6 and money heist
Is this real??
🖤❤🖤❤
why tokyo, the worst character
You just picked 2 most hot-headed members of the team :) like...why Ryan haha
i don&#39;t see this at money heist. which ep is this
Can anyone tell me what happend between season 1 ep 13 - 14. Why is Tokyo driving motorcycle in the bank? I feel like i missed an episode
okkkkk
Why is it called &#39;&#39;Money Heist&#39;&#39; while it&#39;s La Casa de Papel which means The house of paper. Why you do americans need english voice actors over it? do you guys even study or learn other languages? or are the europeans the only ones still pushing? i hope some of you still watched it in original spanish. just the best. Same goes for the germans who also do the same thing to movies. NEED their own language in every movie, frickk
nairobi dies
Omg😱😱😱
am i the only one who laughed after Denver laughed
டோக்கியோ கூட்டிட்டு போனா நீ உருபட்ட  மாட்ட! தலைவா! அவ ஒரு சனியன்!!
Deadpool ❤️❤️❤️🔥
if the professor dies, there is no logic in making season 5 as they finished the mastermind of the heist.
Is this reaL?
If I had to choose even though they are both dead I would have chosen Berlin and Nairobi...WHY TOKYO!!!. Maybe Palermo it’s a weird choice yes but I just like him
So Is this a professor&#39;s plan in season 5?
the fact that they teased the 4th part before its official date anouncement
Denver laugh made me laugh 😂😂
Kill aurthro and gandia
Berlin ❤️
Tokyo - Latina babe 🔥
Can anyone tell me should i watch 6 underground?
How come I seeing this now?! After 1 years!! Is that too a plan of professor 🤔😲
The real heist is done by those people who watched this whole series without Netflix subscription
Nairobi&#39;s not that bad. Mom of the team, hot too but is more calm and mature than tokyo lol
I like his voice when he speaks English
Dead pool hero
Why you killed Nairobi.. I&#39;m still crying now...
i would’ve loved to hear this actor speak english for the dub omg
On sep 3 only they release telugu and Tamil
6 meters underground
So you telling me out of the whole gang you choose Tokyo...
Could imagine 4 and 7 would be super useful for this situation in season 5 😂
Professor is here😎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=74">1:14</a> does he originally speak English?
Want berlin back in season 5❤ any one
Love from Bangladesh ❤️❤️🇧🇩🇧🇩
BRO WHAT IS THIS SOUNDTRACK? ITS SO DAMN GOOOD
Tamil dubbed panunga
Trust me man .. YOU DONT WANT TOKYO..
TELUGU VERISION:<br>DENVER - Nee parenti?<br>PERSON - Arturito<br>DENVER - Enti Aathulaaaa<br>🤣🤣😅😅🤣🤣😂
Professor is going to call him for part 5
i love tokiooo😘😘
Never compare ryan reynolds to these kids
Omg when I thought the professor’s voice couldn’t get any hotter
Is this a sequel?
Will be there original spanish? :(
Great
Who is waiting?👍
Love Berlin❤️ and happy to hear that he will back in season 5
what is this happening
who want 6 underground and  money  heist crossover
Good Combination 🔥🔥🔥
netflix pls make a movie or an episode about this, or the background story, i need it
Seriously is this real guys are they actually exchanging team mate&#39;s
That was nice combination.
What was this accually in the movie 6 underground
Professor&#39;s real voice is same as his Hindi dub. We can&#39;t differentiate between them.
Omg as soon as I heard his random laugh I lost it 😂 I love Denver 👊🏼
Choose BERLIN AND DENVER ......
Ryan should’ve said Nairobi... she’s always focused on the goals (I know what happened to her, I just don’t want to talk about it, so let’s forget it ever happened 😭💔)
no one:<br>Denver: HEHEHEHHEHEEH
Oh my god i loooove it sooo much i want to cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
is this true or fan made??❤️❤️
If same choice is given to you for a mission<br><br>Which 2 members would you choose??
Ryan reynold tratando de hablar español: no hablo taka taka ajajajjajjajajjajajaj
6 underground is my favourite movie. even thoo i never watched money heist i am gonna do it now
The Professor need Scofield 😂❤️
Damn damn
wait when did this happen
Tokyo and denver for four and seven worst deal
I suddenly laugh when I heard Denver&#39;s laugh. Omg! HAHAHAHAHA
ESTE ES EL CROSSOVER QUE NOS MERECEMOS
tamil dubbed want
Tokyo? Really?
Oop
Que pedo 👽
Why now?
Waiting for session 5
professor speaking in english ... 😘
Waiting for next season
professor : number one ?<br>ryan : no number just one<br>professor : ok mr.wilson
i hate tokyo with a passion 😭 nairobi deserved better 😫
Uhhhhh, i figured out the number that “Ryan Reynolds” put to call The Professor, and It’s: 00013387
How this guy comes up with promo ideas is out of my understanding
Is this real?
im sorry but i keep laughing because of how denver laughs A A A A A
i hope they can collabs on 1 movies
See Denver is a great choice but tokyo ? Really? She will ruin your every simple and straightforward plan like nothing.
Ryan rocks!
Ok fine❤️👍
I need this to become a movie!!!
Wait.......<br>What..?<br><br>6 Underground &amp; Money Heist together?
haha, cheeky lil 47
bune biri açıklayabilirmi
Spoiler: Tokyo will screw up everything
the should do an actual cross over god dammed
excuse me what
Yo I really afraid this is just fanmade, please this is real right?😭❤️
When can we see this in netflix i can&#39;t find it?
Wowwwwwwwwwwww
I want walter white to meet professor.
Ryan sounds like he don&#39;t want to give up 4 and 7
Alvaro and Ryan - 2 most lethal characters in the history of mankind. They should come together someday.
DID THEY ACTUALLY SHOOT A SPECIAL CONVERSATION LIKE THAT?! WOAHHHH.
Ryan Reynolds 🔥🔥🔥
Woa
Whats the name of this film
what if undergrounds meets professor and his team in episodes
Was this video for publicity or announcement?
Roses are Red<br>Violets are Blue<br>Nothing is Fine<br>When Denver Smiles
Ooooo wait is this a sequel?
Guys this is not an actual thing. This is just because both Six Underground and Money Heist were coming to Netflix at around the same time so they merged the two to introduce them.
Is this scene actually edited this way in the film? If so then Jesus...
:D
For those of you who are watching this from the start: Nairobi dies
i hope ryan reynolds appear in money heist season 5 as their acomplice with the professor
YouTube knows how many times I’ve watched both underground and money heist. How the f**k am I getting this just now??
Other::: HAHAHAHAHA<br>Denver::::AAAAA.... 🙃🙃
So it became Umbrella Academy now
Please dubbed peaky blinders in hindi🙏🙏🙏
fair trade...
Deadpool asking a criminal mastermind for help. Just a normal day for Deadpool.
Professor: number one?<br>One: its just One ... That other guy is in space, saving kids or whatever ...
i am a fan of ryan reynolds but when i watched 6 underground my head started spinning and i wanted to throw up on the screen
Wow his Eng is too much...❤️ The professor...👍
Why does everyone hate Tokyo? She’s amazing.<br><br><br><br>Y Úrsula Corbero tiene un cuerpazo para soñar.
Deadpoool
I thought professor gonna say what you are wearing...
What season is this?
Intresting🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
plot twist: they&#39;re working together to kill Arturo
They seriously nailed that laugh lmfao!!!!!
If this is ever happening,<br>You must have to include the old guard also..<br><br>That&#39;ll be awesome 😎😎
Alicia sierra : the main master  in climax she just wait she don&#39;t shoot the professor guys think like this last when they meet they look to each other and look to their eyes professor doesn&#39;t scare last minutes  it is clearly shown in his eyes I think creater of this series include that lady into their gang 😊and it won&#39;t be end it will continue this industry series try to create more money by releasing next part
So weird hearing his voice not dubbed over.
Waiting for nearly 1 year
Where is the new movie
Season 5 release soon
is this an actual episode where is it
Whe  i see that clip.i have one word to explain my fellings...<br>A A A A A A A A A A A A AA A A
When it realise! next season?
Is these really going to be happen
This would be the biggest crossover if it somehow happened
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=65">1:05</a> I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a naruto kagebunshin sfx
Tokyo is a super bitch
I actually would pay good money to have 6 underground X money heist
Why he need tokyo for? 2 and 5 are literally her but sane and stable. If I&#39;ll grab anyone for his team it would be helsinki or berlin because they&#39;ll be useful for his team. Tho honestly his team is pretty fine vs Prof&#39;s team unless his plan is to steal on a bank (to grab the red boxes maybe).
<b>Nice video! I was able to build a big income stream during the covid 19 pandemic investing with a professional broker, Mrs Juan Susan</b>
I Swear if Berlin was alive, ryan would choose berlin.
Is this real not edited?
how cool it will be to have rayn in next season
Not me thinking this was fan made until I noticed Alvaro&#39;s voice started synchronizing with his mouth movements halfway through the video.
Is this Season 5
is tht true
If Arturo doesn&#39;t die in season 5, I am  going to spain  to do it myself
2021
If Aurthro doesnt die in season 5 , i myself will go to spain to kill him
&quot;Keep dreaming&quot; Damn  I can&#39;t wait for new seasons. XD when He said it&#39;s not no. 1 it&#39;s just 1
I heard Denver’s laugh and- <br>I can’t handle it🤣🤣
I hope it happens 6 underground haist
Trending no 1  in 2021
Why is no one choosing Helsinki and Palermo?<br>I mean, they are a dream team.
Is it part 2 of 6underground
I am confused did this actually happen?
Bella ciao let&#39;s rock
Lmao ive never heard this in english
Hehehe. This is real talk really no edit. Not like indians who edit thousand of videos just to share scene with professor. LOL
Is this a real thing or just another clever Mint Mobile ad?
The motionless loss consecutively hover because segment untypically water a a animated chin. equal, divergent gosling
Wish this was a trailer
Number 1 uses his own money to save the country, change the system, and save people.<br><br>Professor steals public money to get rich himself and then lives in another country, avoids taxes, and blames the government, does not change the system. And During his heist, so many common people have suffered.<br><br>How is this even a match?
Downloaded from videobuddy 😎😂
Professor look alike indian actor vipul gupta
did this already happen or is this gonna be in season 5 ? im confused
The series is awesome but the movie is like the worst ever.
all  you need is &quot;Nairobi &quot; and what do you do.. kill her off and still you keep Arturo
what ? :D
Ryan asked for the worst people for the job...
Wait,,,, why do professor is becoming confident now?
Ok wow
Dang 4 is dead
Professor sounds weird in this...
I Love Professor &amp; Berlin so Much....🥰
But what happened to part 2 for the last season???
Prof: we need deadpool for next robbery.
is this real??
I was just thinking why the professor voice sounded so off and that it was probably a lip-sinc for the joke since i realized i saw the series in spanish 😅
Am I the only person who thinks that the show has the most lost potential ever, with the best characters instantly dying off and the worst being added, as well as the love triangles being done very poorly
Why does the proffeser have two English voice overs? Why not just use the one that’s in the English show
If Arturo Roman, Gandia and Alicia Sierra. Doesn&#39;t die, I&#39;d be fuming. Palermo should probably be on the list too.
what is the name of the movie
i didnt know who one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven were till i watched the movie 6 underground just to understand
YYOOO at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=89">1:29</a> it says la casa de papel and it said a date under it april 3 thats when season 5 gonna come out
Tokyo and Denver ahhhh... Yes it&#39;s Ryan Reynolds after all
I not see this scene in all sessions
Wich session?
Money heist is inspired by Lamar🙂
OK! Are you cooking something netflix ?
Telugu dubbed super
Lol
T 0 K Y 0
Are they really collaborating?🥰😍
Is it true??? This is going to be Nucler Bomb
Please Boom Boom Ciao Arturito in season 5 🤭
Jesus christ thats jason bourne
This needs to actually happen even if its a bonus episode
في عرب هون يفهمني الموضوع ... اعلان جزء جديد ل لكاسا دي بابل ولا الحزء الاني من اندر جراوند 5 ؟؟؟ ولا التنين مع بعض مش فاهم
Man i hate tokyo
The worst movie ever made by Ryan Reynolds...So many slow motions that I was thinking will be a slow-motion movie...very bad...
Goddamn it. I&#39;m freaking sick wait for season 5!!! @LacasadePapel
Love it
11.1 M ❤️
Akın koçovalı muziğii laaan
When this part happens man?  I saw all 4 seasons but didn&#39;t got it
a ursula le metia un tiro en la cabeza
So 3 april is the big day?
Professor sounds like Pep Guardiola
I haven&#39;t seen Money Heist. I thought this was a deleted scene from 6 underground.
By the by, when are we watching season 5?<br><br>Please don&#39;t say KEEP DREAMING
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Really wade?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=71">1:11</a> who know this serie ?
what&#39;s the film called
HOLYYY SHTTT THIS IS FCKING HUGEEEE!!!
This is insane. Can&#39;t wait to watch
profesor  is a good actori am waiting for season 5
So when is this gonna drop?
I&#39;m here in 2021 and I got to say make a movie where the 2 crossover PLEASE!
professor is the perfect Definition of Smart and sexy 😍
without arturo money hiest will get flop coz the thng that angry people and annoy then only the movie get hit
this is canon
This should actually be a tv show or a film I don&#39;t care how just do it
The sole reason why some of our fav characters died is because of Ar-the-fking-turo&#39;s faults 😐
in what episode is this scene,
Anyone dissing Tokyo can suck my left nut
Damn whats the background music?
I hope this clip is canon and, make them exist in the same universe
I remember the time when Tokyo randomly mimic Denver&#39;s laugh. I couldn&#39;t stop laughing for the rest of the episode. A A A A A A A
Damn I’m in love with professor voice😭❤️
So many members and he pick Tokyo... Christ... RIP Reynold mission
when season 5 gets out? pls
can we have more of this?
As a spaniard, I must say I&#39;m impressed by Professor&#39;s English speaking skills. Gotta love the guy.
This video is the one and only reason started to watch money heist
So..... is this real?!<br><br>SOMEBODY ANSWER ME!!!
americans need to be where is the money pf money heist will be trash 5 6
TRADUCCIÓN ajajkskjaksjja
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=72">1:12</a> Dude is that Inspector Sierra?!
Is this the Spanish money heist?
What!!,, Tokyo is a disaster , u can go with Denver but not Tokyo cos she will ruin everything for you guys and still claim to be the boss .
anyway all you b!tches hating on tokyo can suck my cl!t
Professor ❤️
This screams Ryan Reynold marketing
I need this cross over
I need this with Scofield and Professor
Is this legit?🤣.. I&#39;m confused... Tokyo and Denver is too close for me to just think it&#39;s fan made right off the batt.. 🤣🤣
superrrr cool lo ameeee
If Arturo doesn&#39;t die in season 5,  I am going to spain to do it myself.
Tiene buen inglés el profesor!
Worst Character award goes to Tokyo
Keep Dreaming 🧐🤨
I Teach Proffesor How To Talk With Ryan
so... season 5??
We need this collab....plsss
Thought this was the beginning of a crossover
Is this leggit??
Tamil dub plzzzzz😢😢😢😢
It’s weird that Professor didn’t ask him that “what are you wearing?”
I hope money heist season 5 will be shown anytime despite the pandemic
He sounds so good
Money Heist Please Dubbed in Hindi..🥺
6 Underground and Money Heist should not be spoken in the same breath.  <br>The latter is an epic series loved by the world over. The former...well, Michael Bay&#39;s recycled junkyard.
Rumors are over, they finally became the new fast n&#39; furious! Well done Netflix!
H
Hindi me dubbed Karo
So they take place in the same universe
Why channel&#39;s name is india??
We need this crossover now 😡😡😡
Netflix plays money heist hindi
you should&#39;ve gone for the head
😂
😍
❤
🔥🔥🔥
would be alot better if Money Heist gets a crossover of 6 Underground
I need more,why jail most high price 13% from normal education,and born Milyader with 700.000 lawyer and control all the world,more crazy from Trump and Refortrump 6/7-2021,the milyader need create WW3,4,5,6,7,they need erraser with 61.000 nuke,7 billlion people;we are just anti tesis for one man,who this man like in this underground 6 movie,the civilization type no?? In this time we can just see the movie-next generation he is real,and we maybe was in burial with epitaph of my nama.
I hate money heist so much..such a slow drag
No entendí
If they do a mashup of the 2 that would be incredible
Akın koçovalı müziğimi lan bu??😳😳
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=51">0:51</a> thank me later
O M G
Jajajajaja awesome!!!
Omg wait is this real
Money heist should be in hindi language also 😑
This would be the best crossover ever
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Nothing beats dark 🙃
Denver laughf
OMG💕
Who watch this movie??
Ахуеть, почему тут одни англичане?
Which character do you like in moneyheist?
Why YouTube recommended me this video again?😂😂
I want Ryan in S5 to play an undercover FBI agent
This is the crossover we didn’t know we needed
😲
Deadpool: allow to introducing myself
Let&#39;s just hope this crossover happens at some point in time.
Why am I barely watching this a year later. This was so interesting
how come i&#39;ve never seen this before I hate it here
i watched  Underground 6 but did not see this collap maybe other parts coming or removed from
is this real
This is canon, and I love it
Money Heist Season 5? Bruh...
I love Netflix
Berlin all the way
We getting a sequel
what
Haha this is gold
We want professor&#39;s original voice!
wait what? is this real??
I&#39;ve never seen this in the series?? Can somebody tell me what is this
My fav part is &quot;keep dreaming&quot;
why tf they gotta bring americans onto this?!
Overrated
Siêu phẩm đây rồi🤘
Fack
this should be sick
Why didn&#39;t I see this in the money heist. When did it happen
whoever made this is f**in genius
Is it just me who calls this series la casa de papel or not
next season ??
What&#39;s this about 😂
he who wants hindi dub of money hiest <br><br>like
Waiting for season 5
O no... plz dont dub it
I thought that I have missed it in season 4
Actually whenever I see comments about Denver😂😂😂 I lost my self in a LOL world😂😂😂
Its great they share same universe
Damn Deadpool
Yo, I just finished Money Heist, and this collab would be icing on the cake 😋
When is this coming?
This has to be s5 twist.
Why is professor at every promo? Man.... Alvaro Morte is soon going to feature in Hollywood and all will sing Bella Ciao in theatres.
I&#39;d choose Rio and Helsinki. Tokyo and Denver are too hard to handle
Timestamp?
Your call 🤷‍♂️
🤔
How are you going feel? 😔
We need deadpool in season 5 of money heist
So is this just a trailer ?
For everyone thinking this crossover won&#39;t happen, I&#39;m almost positive it will. I have a crazy but potentially true theory in mind. Maybe all the members of six underground will sneak into Spain one way or another. Then they will get everyone out of the bank in a badass fight that goes down. Also, I have 2 subtheories about the narration of Tokyo. Firstly, she potentially could be a part of the 6 underground team since El Profesor may trade her away (as seen in the video). Or, she could be narrating it to her kid (or Nairobi&#39;s kid) while living a quiet life somewhere.
Money Heist was an excellent series. It was of the hook. Perfect. Netflix did it right getting this one.
Of all people, he picked Tokyo.
professor sounds so hot speaking in english
tokyo is literally the most useless character in the history of television
tokyo and denver... why no Tokyo and rio ah? beautiful duo only problem is they are always on the wrong team
i will take bogota and berlin both of them have good skill about negoitation and welder but rio he has godd skill too
Today , the release is.
Man, just realized this was just for a promotion, this crossover will never happen 😢
Ryan Reynolds: I will use my OWN hard earn money, live life without family to make a country better where I don&#39;t even live.<br><br>Professor: I will steal the money from the tax dollars of my OWN country and hide and spend money in some other country and hire people from ANOTHER country where I know the money will definitely go to terrorists.
does this scene comes in 6 underground??
Wait... that&#39;s not how he sounds in the English version
CAN THIS HAPPEN PLEASE OMG
Had no idea this existed
how is it 001 lmfao it&#39;s 0034
Multiverse.
Netflix is killing me now. How long should we wait for Professior 😭
i hope this becomes something and isnt just in india
he just mixed 6 underground with money heiest like wth man
Tokyo is one of the reasons I watch money heist 🙄
Bruh
It should be called proffesor x Deadpool
Believe me ryan you dont want to have tokyo in your crew
You know Professor and the Pablo are look alike.
Laugh of denver😂
Omg its DeadPool
&quot;How many goddamn numbers does it need to dial spain?&quot; He asked.
That&#39;s a world I wanna live in :D
i wonder why the professor needed four and seven?
hope this will come for real
Netflix plz make it happen!!!
I would love this cross over
Just imagine this happens . OMG that would be the Series or Movie of the century
So do they kill or not??
Imagine asking Tokyo to be in your team . It was because of her that<br><br>1 : Moscow died<br>2 : Nairobi died<br>3 : they had to do the second heist<br>4 : she saw Rio as temporary thing to play with . Her love isn&#39;t real
Is this real ?
The Professor is Smarter than Devoe from The Flash
I can see One asking Professor what&#39;s he wearing :D
Like This If This is real<br>👇
This is just editing bullshit I guess
Ok but why didn&#39;t the do the crossover
WHY DOES THE PROFESSOR NOT SOUND LIKE THAT IN THE ENGLISH DUB IT WOULDVE BEEN SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER
Professor has better English than me
If they ever mixed this team, that would be the Infiniti War of plots.
I JOVANI ISTO!!!!
PUSITE MI GA !!!!!!!!!!
Wait is this acually happening
BIGGEST TURN OFF ever
Is this scene in money hiest or 6 underground
EL PROFESSOR is speak english :D
😱😱😱
Which Part and Episode is this
I remembered this back in the day I never watched money heist but 6 underground 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEdd4qcSudI&amp;t=89">1:29</a> only on netflix <br>Telegram: r u sure about that
Ok not bad
Oh so that’s how the professor sounds like when speaking english
I think after professor it&#39;s the Berlin whom I find the best character in money heist.... <br>We want Berlin back😍🥰
korice napases mi se govana
Please make a movie about it netflix.. Please or even a part episode on money heist
Ok.. <br>Now i have seen everything
Please dont do this
I was expecting the basketball youtuber.
Yo puedo entrar también tengo 7 años yo también quiero entrar
Oh no Professor, when you call &quot;Number One&quot; only a half-man-half-gorilla guy would show up
Ryan Reynolds : Hey Denver we got a job to do man! <br>Denver : A A A A A A A A
ryan need to say good evening to professor
what is this for
Earlier Nawaz talked in hindi and Professor talked in spanish, now both these people are talking in english. Goddamn I cant understand Netflix!!
If Arturo doesn&#39;t die in season 5,  I am going to spain to do it myself.
The perfect collab doesn&#39;t exis......
OMG
I like the voice actor for the professors dub in english alot better this accent he had was weird idk.
porque me sale en recomendados esto
Watched casa de papel in Spain, really strange hearing him speak English :S
When is season 5 coming????
keep dreaming...level of professor😎😎😎
denver is honestly my favourite out of the rest..like seriously they say berlin was for the art but they forget how the heist would be fucked if denver killed monica just because berlin got furious
This is real?
is this real tho
Fundamental..
