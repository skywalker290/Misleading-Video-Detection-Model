&quot;I will be reinstituting prima nocta&quot; yikes 😬😬
Scene ini mengacu pada captain Amerika. Saat melawan Thanos di end game. Kalau mata kalian teliti dia membuat gerakan sangat kecil ke palu Thor.
It takes a very humble man not to show that he can do something when everyone else can&#39;t. Steve knows he can. But he stopped himself, so not to show off and not to make anyone one in the room look or feel bad. Most of all, Thor. He put his friends&#39; feelings and  their friendships b4 his pride. He put himself last. As any good leader should. And that&#39;s what makes him worthy.
I always loved this scene.
I love how the fact tha cap is gonna get the hammer in endgame
Damn mark ruffalo is so cringe everyone else is awesome
I just noticed...is Tony practicing counting cards? Looks like a flop and a river in front of him, def not solitaire and hes not playing anyone else....god his mind just doesn&#39;t switch off does it
Mjolnir suppress Jane&#39;s cancer because once, Thor asked it to protect her. Cap can lift it because Thor was about to be killed by Thanos. Odin jinx it so that it would also protect Thor. Odin knew that one day Thor would need protection from harm. Because it was originally Hela&#39;s. Hela is its true master. Hela is stronger than Thor.
There is a theory that he did not lift it out of concern for Thor. I really don&#39;t think Steve could have lifted the hammer at this time. I like the theory that his best friend confessed to killing his friend&#39;s father and accepted that reality, which is why he was able to master the hammer in the final battle.
They had that endgame scene planned years before it actually happened. That&#39;s the marvel we are missing these days
Foreshadowing much? Steve was 99% worthy in that moment, so it shifted slightly. But that 1% of unworthiness that prevented Steve from lifting it was because he was trying to for a selfish competition. When he finally did lift Mjolnir, it was to save Thor’s life and a half of life.
For a moment thor thinks he going to lost Asgard
No one even Cap himself notice tht he slightly made the hammer move.. Only Thor saw it n he was holding his breath or told hammer to stop😅😅
I think Cap actually did not reveal he could pick it up lol. And Thor knew he was faking. 😅   only to reveal it when he took on Thanos
At :38, Tony moves it right before the camera cuts
These are the types of scenes that made phase 4 the best 💯
Stark sneaking in the rape joke there.
... And it was little details like this that made us love MCU.... Too bad we&#39;ll never be invested the same way again...
Thors smile just vanishes
It&#39;s so cool, how Cap acts Chill when Thor says your not worthy. They both knew and just went along with it
I can only imagine the theater’s reaction when they first saw this lol
Can I Clean Here?
Dude, Hawkeye was not having it when Banner tried 😂
For a split second when Stark puts his wrist in the holder before he attempts to lift it you can actually see the mjolnir move like a prop
Who is the girl @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=75">1:15</a>?
can we still gonna see all gang have some friendships moment like this again in some next MCU movies, i really missed them so much
&quot;Are you on my team&quot;?
that desk is the strongest avengers for real.
Still love this scene
That&#39;s why captain is captain of all of them , and that&#39;s why he is my favourite super Hero 🤝🙌🙌🙌🙌
So why did Stan Lee use a car to pull Mjolnir in the Thor movie? Why not dig the dirt under the hammer?<br>In Avengers 2, the hammer is on the table and no one can lift it. Why not lift the table?<br><br>So why didn&#39;t Stan Lee and the others dig out the dirt underneath the hammer? Take the hammer with you<br><br>Just can&#39;t lift the table? Lift the table, lift it with the hammer, why don&#39;t they think that?<br><br>If the table cannot be lifted, at least the table must be damaged to see if the hammer remains intact or will fall. No one has ever moved the hammer (except those people)<br><br>If you let the hammer float in space, wouldn&#39;t anyone be able to lift it? Because there is no gravity or gravity<br><br>Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t discuss these illogical things because it&#39;s just a movie, but there are a lot of loopholes
24
Mjolnir: NO ONE CAN PICK ME UP!! JUST MY MASTER, THOR!! HAHA!!<br><br>Cap: <b>pretending to strain to pick it up but barely using muscle to make it move slightly</b><br><br>Mjolnir: Did I JUST MOVED?! 💀
Whoever thinks Steve could lift it but didn&#39;t to not &quot;embarrass&quot; Thor are dumb he&#39;s not worthy here lol u see him really pulling flexing his arms trying to pull Thor knows maybe one day he will be worthy but in aou hes not
He absolutely could have picked it up, he chose not to!
“Smell the silent judgement?”
Not ALL, Thor... You&#39;ll see!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=76">1:16</a> her smile
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> If you take a closer look you can actually notice that the hammer moves a little
Who is the women at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=100">1:40</a> i forgot about her.
My favorite scene in the movie. The moments of the gang bonding as human beings are infinitely more interesting than CGI battles.

Best Avengers scene Tbh
That&#39;s a good game: who gets to pick up Mjolnir.<br>Hawkeye/Clint Barton failed.<br>Tony Stark/Iron Man and Jimmy Rhoades failed.<br>Bruce Banner/Hulk failed.<br>Steven Rodgers partially succeeded but didn’t want to hurt Thor&#39;s feelings.<br>As the inscription of Mjnoir: &quot;Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.&quot;<br>Gotta love the Avengers when they hang out as friends when they&#39;re not out saving the world.
Did Rogers just pretend he can&#39;t lift that ?
Cap didn&#39;t want to embarress thor 😂😂😂😂
The reason he&#39;s worthy is because he puts others peoples life above his own and is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others and doesn&#39;t like bullies.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
&quot;I have a simple one you&#39;re not worthy&quot; got me dying
for everyone saying Steve probably was being nice to Thor, there is quite a more interesting theory in the fact that he wasn&#39;t quite worthy yet because he still kept Tony&#39;s parents&#39; death a secret from Tony. That was the only lie he kept to himself to protect his friend and that is why he couldn&#39;t lift the hammer here, but could in Endgame.
Worthy or not, Thor still gets preferential treatment from it.
I recommend my channel
Should I attempt I better not for safe measure
Tips ntricks
I mean technically it is possible the other avengers are just not strong enough considering if thor&#39;s hammer is made from a dwarf star it would weigh 1,500,000,000,000 pounds
Did captain pretend not to be able to lift it in order to not insult Thor?
&quot;Ha ha Nothing&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">01:21</a> the look when your girl laughs harder at another guy&#39;s joke over yours.
I miss the old team so much. I don&#39;t dislike the new team because they&#39;re of a certain race or gender, or because they&#39;re overpowered (look at how far THOR has come while remaining loveable). I miss the old team because it felt like a family hanging out, and the new team is just a bunch of strangers who barely seem to know each other exist-especially Captain Marvel who&#39;s apparently been going out of her way to avoid Earth according to her newest movie.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
wooooooorrrrrrthyyyyyy<br>How could you be worthy? You&#39;re all killers.
Everytime I see the look on Thor’s face it gets me 😂
Widow would have been able to lift it (she does in the comics) so they had her turn it down lol
What if captian america was worthy he didint wanted to mock thor
I like to think that the reason Steve couldn’t lift it fully was because he never told Tony about his parent’s death
You can clearly see the restraint in Cap&#39;s face in his 2nd attempt after he knows he can lift it. That is not the face of a man who is pulling with all his might. It&#39;s the face of a man who is only pretending to be. He didn&#39;t want to make Thor look bad in front of everyone. Truly a worthy hero.
also captain CAN actually pick it up but he didn’t want to ruin thors pride 😎
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It was funny when Bully Maguire just walked right on in there and picked it up while flipping it in the air just like Thor did. 😎
Greatest set up in cinema
Thor was so worried 😂
Lot of people glossing over the “reinstituting Prima Nocta” line
It&#39;s little moments like this that make Cap my favourite
Imagine wielding weapon without even trying😅
His face when Steve moved it was like shit
I used to think AoU was such a weak Avenger movie... Now i fucking WISH these recent MCU films were that weak.
Does magneto can lift the Hammer?
Worthy is a rather interesting word in this case, considering the Captains more worthy than Thor, especially with that much of an ego
Marvel peaked in this Movie
StEvE KnEw He CoUlD LiFt It He ChOsE nOt To. No, he didn’t. The first time he attempted it might’ve worked but it surprised him so he dropped it, the second attempt he was pulling with his strength rather than innocently so it didnt work.
How does this happen if Jarvis is already “destroyed”? Wouldn’t Tony have noticed something was wrong when he put his and Rhodes arm on?
Black widow can lift the hammer. If she try it.
I was here after victor magtanggol failed to lift your hammer thor.
Kratos lifting it off pure strength <br><br>Mcu thor: 💩
Thor&#39;s reaction when cap picks up the hammer a little bit🤌
Who is the blue girl on the sofa
Cap could def lift it, but being so humble as he is, chose not to.
Captain is worthy
The upscaling is soooo bad.
How does it not break the table?
So is Natasha able to lift the hammer?
Love when BW says “that’s not a question I need answered “
i knew it
I just now noticed Bruce and Natasha basically in their own little world/conversation.
Man wouldn’t it be crazy if Steve was actually able to lift the hammer?
I also love the little detail of Thor passing Cap more of that Asgardian alcohol.
😂😂😂😂
WHEN WIDOW SAID “THAT’S NOT A QUESTION I NEED ANSWERED”<br>Y’all!!<br>SHE WOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE HAMMER!!<br>SHE WAS ALWAYS READY TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE (when she threw herself for the stone)<br>SHE WAS ALWAYS WORTHY! <br>I’m sorry I’m in caps but my mind is blown &amp; I hope y’all get something out of this!
Well, all but one...

Eu num tenho tempo nem pra tomar banho eliazir coelho
Anatoly : Excuse me, can I clear here ?? 🏋️🏋️🏋️
Mjolnir: &quot;Maybe next time baby.&quot;
Is the table worthy? If not it should have shattered when he set it down
Thor was wheezing his pants when Cap made it budge
In Norse mythology, anybody could lift Mjolnir, but only if they were physically strong enough
Interpolation?
that &quot;youre not worthy&quot; Capt took it personally
I also just seen Thor has to push his hand a little when lifting up the hammer so in end game cap didn&#39;t does that mean cap is. 100 and Thor is 90😅
All these comments are so old and we all miss iron man😭
Those who aren&#39;t worthy can&#39;t lift the hammer, and those who are won&#39;t.
if they laugh you&#39;re safe
Jane Lifted it she put Tony,Rhodes and Clint into shame
Tony was chatting. Then what he said before trying to lift it. He has a girl. But he still said it. I think he snd Pepper in the beginning of braking up. He said thet they were in civil war. Tony try to show s good face. But stress in his love life was in his mind too i think.
&quot;Gee, this thing is light as a feather!&quot; - Mr. Fred Rogers
what makes you worthy of lifting the hammer tho?
I bet you that cap couldn&#39;t lift the hamer cause the secret of Tony&#39;s parents.
So they’ve confirmed that cap could’ve lifted the hammer in this scene, wouldn’t it have been helpful if he used the hammer during the movie.
At the end of the day it&#39;s all fake 😂😂😂
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Clint and Maria Hill faces when Bruce made de Hulk joke ...
What happened to scenes like this?
Guys! The answer is on Steve&#39;s face before he gets off the couch. Notice the way he stares at Thor. That looks he gives to the God of Thunder, is the same look us humans give to someone who&#39;s challenging us, telling us we can&#39;t do something, when we know we can. So, if Cap wasn&#39;t worthy because of Tony&#39;s parents&#39; killer, then he would not have been able to move it an inch.<br><br>As a bonus, Josh Whedon said in an interview,&quot; he isn&#39;t worthy or did he stopped? &quot;. When asked by a person why Cap wasn&#39;t worthy. <br><br>This facts are enough to end the debate. Cap was worthy on Age Of Ultron, and he knew it all along. He just decided to not embarrassed Thor.
This is my favorite scene in the entire MCU. Love the rapport between all of them, the joking around. All the tiny character momsnts. The whole party scene in the movie is great.
I miss Hill
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=60">1:00</a> James Rhodes: are you even pulling <br><br>Tony Stark: are you on my team <br><br>James Rhodes: just represent pull<br><br>Tony Stark: all right let&#39;s go
🔨
This is kinda a powerful scene cause shows how super heroes are not that different from us, they also do parties and enjoy playing games
Anatoly: <b><i>Can I clean here?”</i></b>
They should have Dr Strange try this 😂
Personally, I feel like Cap still had to let go of certain things before being fully able to lift the Hammer. While Winter Soldier showed him that “the good guys” can be infected by “the bad”, Civil War is where he learned that the good or bad thing went beyond “I serve my country/my world”, which is where he decided to stand for the right thing. Events of Civil War pushed the worthiness over the edge.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can ai sing or conjure technology
Tony isn&#39;t wrong here. It is physics. The hammer is an immovable object. 😉
This is honestly my favorite scene in the mcu. Just people hanging out, its always been cool to me
Wish we could’ve seen the Guardians of the Galaxy do this…
Cap was worthy so he didn&#39;t lift the hammer, which is what made him worthy. <br>Or you could say Mjölnir knew Cap would be the only one too humble to show he could (where Stark could but would brag about it).
Mjolnir when Cap tries: we do a lil trolling
I mean Steve was already willing to risk his life by jumping on a grenade before he would even be ready to fight a war or get the serum that alone speaks volumes
Clint seems pretty half hearted in trying to lift the hammer. He definitely doesn’t believe it’s magic but can live with not having it himself.<br><br>Tony, after failing to do it initially, immediately tries to solve the problem with technology. Showing how reliant he is on it. <br><br>Bruce jokingly pretends to hulk out, I’m assuming because he doesn’t take the possibility of being worthy of more power seriously considering what has happened with the power he already has<br><br>Steve is worthy, but doesn’t need to prove anything to the Avengers or himself so he chooses to not go through with it. He’s not the kind of person who seeks out more power, so the only reason he’d need to lift it here would be to satisfy his ego. He instead walks away.<br><br>Natasha has no interest in trying to find out if she’s worthy because she’s still struggling with her past and is, judging by the last movie, not sure she’s actually making up for it. Last thing she needs is divine confirmation she’s still a monster. <br><br>These are my interpretations of this scene at least
How heavy is Thor&#39;s Hammer?
I think you can see Steve loosen his grip the moment he felt it budge
The look on Thor’s face when he saw Mjølnir move!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is such a good scene 😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=90">1:30</a> &quot;Ha ha, nothing.&quot; At that moment, a secret bond was born between Captain America and Thor.
Black Widow should try it too.
There will never be another MCU scenes like this, unlike these woke marvels that miss the basic storyline
&quot;60 fps&quot; looks like shit. Stop doing it. If a film was not filmed in 60 fps, the upscaling from 24-30 to 60 looks like dog water. Please stop doing it. Its ruining film
The table 🗿
thor was like “oh. oh shit.”
do you guys think Ultron would&#39;ve been able to lift mjolnir? Considering Vision was able to, yes Ultron had a different goal, but Ultrons mindset wasn&#39;t that of self-doubt. <br>What made Thor worthy again is self-sacrifice, and unwavering doubt. Despite Ultron&#39;s corrupted goal, Ultron knew exactly what he wanted and made every decision precisely to fulfill his goal. <br><br>Just food for thought.
The whole &#39;could he or couldn&#39;t he&#39; thing is an interesting debate, it&#39;s hard to say for sure if he could lift it. But one thing is for sure... Cap would have surely had to have noticed that it did budge for him? I mean if Thor could see it, surely Cap noticed too, it was in his hand, he should have felt it wiggle. The fact he said nothing about that, very telling...
Cap would&#39;ve lifted it if he actually tried and didn&#39;t give up so quick. Lol
&quot;Are you even pulling?&quot;<br>&quot;Are you on my team?&quot; <br>&quot;Just represent, pull!&quot; <br>LMAO, I love how both RDJ and Cheedle are just using every ounce of force to lift Mjøllnir and nothing is even happening 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=43">0:43</a> I love Thor&#39;s subtle eye-roll here 😂
This was prime avengers now marvel just sucks
The consensus seems to be that Cap was able to pick it up here. However, here&#39;s where it gets interesting. When it budges, did Steve consciously decide not to pick it up then? Or did he subconsciously avoid lifting it to not cause drama? We know he&#39;s really not one for fame or praise.
I remember, before endgame watching theories about this scene and thinking &quot;oh thats awesome, probably wasnt intentional but i love the headcanon&quot;<br><br>I wish more movies/series were dedicated enough to do stuff like this nowadays.
When I watched this in the Theatres, that Prima Nocta joke went straight under the radar, I&#39;m pretty sure I was the only one laughing. Classic Tony.
Back when the MCU was great 😢
What if they lift the coffee table?
Mjolnir was just showing Thor that Cap was worthy, but for whatever reason didn&#39;t want anyone else to know.
I heard mjolnir scrap a bit when Cap tried to move it. I guess it saw into the future and was like naw B!tch not after what you do in Germany one movie from now.😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=61">1:01</a><br>“are you on my team?” <br>“Just represent, now PULL” <br>Bruh the banter between Tony and Rhodey is unparalleled
Thor&#39;s uncomfortable look is way more hilarious in hindsight of Endgame. Also, it would&#39;ve been even funnier if when Tony tried to lift it, Mjolnir, after sensing his unbelievable narcissism, shocked him.
Plot twist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> - Mjolnir actually shifted just a teensy little bit when Cap tried to move it, but then decided to put on extra pounds simply to screw with him.
It&#39;s scenes like this that movies don&#39;t have anymore. Reminded me of Alien, the original dinner scene. The cast was simply told to just talk and that&#39;s why it was so genuine.
Holy fuck the interpolation in this clip looks terrible
Spiderman what the problem mr stark it just a hammer
Super.  Avengers
Everyone is talking about how Captain America was trying to make Thor not feel bad about not being the only one worthy of wielding Mjolnir, but not mentioning the fact that Tony said he would literally breed out the Asgardian population via Prima Nocta if he could lift the hammer LOL.
The reason he didn&#39;t lift it up is exactly why he could.
Also who knew that Cap was trolling us the whole time?
Tony should have been worthy to be honest. He had the qualities of someone who was worthy.
This means Steve was right in Civil war
Still to this day I don’t get how anyone didn’t see the hammer budge when Steve tried to lift it lmaoo
Thats one worthy table
Steve knew he could lift it but chose not to, that alone shows why he’s worthy
We would call this<br><br><br>FORESHADOWING
Thor:<br>“Hello darkness, my old friend<br>I&#39;ve come to talk with you again”
Captain America was always worthy to lift he was not able lift it this time because he really didn&#39;t needed to lift the hammer he was just doing it for fun whereas when thor was unworthy he was only worthy of hammer again when he really needed the hammer and it was life and death situation...
Cap could lift it was because he didnt want it.
God the 60fps interpolation looks horrible. Why do you guys keep doing this shit
Wow this artificial 60fps makes this clip look like ass
I love this scene a lot. It was great to see the Avengers and some hangout and the scene seemed very natural.
I think Steve was just a gentlemen here.
I love the way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> is acted. From &quot;haha good luck&quot; to &quot;oh shit what if he IS worthy??&quot;
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Imagine everyone trying to lift the master sword.
if you notice the harmmer slightly moved when captain America pulled it  before the camera focused was pulled to show thor looking worried <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a>
For years, I kept trying to convince people that cap was always worthy. that the reason he didn’t pick up the hammer was because he didn’t want to pick up the hammer. even when the group ask him on to pick it up, you can see his reluctance to actually try and pick it up.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=65">1:05</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Back when the MCU was good.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=96">1:36</a> makes you think about her sacrifice in Endgame
Steve is such a team player. NFL QB god.
Did anyone hear the metal moving from the table??<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a>
He was worthy 💙
Tbh, Hawkeye not being worthy was odd, since he loved his family, and would do anything for them. But then again, maybe it knew that without his family, he would fall down a dark path.
Wait, so if Tony was still alive. Would that mean he would be able to pick up mjolnir bcos he sacrificed himself
I keep coming back to this scene and damn, it is so good. Thor knew in this scene that Cap was worthy.
MCU back then: who is worthy of Thors hammer<br><br>MCU now : CATS
Imagine if Black widow were able to lift it , I wonder how Thor reaction will be 😂
This clip reminded me of how much I miss Tony Stark.
Again with the libertards view. Steve just couldn&#39;t life the hammer. He was not worthy up until that point of time, that&#39;s it.
Didnt know Tony was a Prima Nocta kinda guy
Love this light moment ❤
Me trying to pull the sword out of the stone in Disneyland <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=65">1:05</a><br>Sidenote: the should use Thor&#39;s Hammer as a worthy pull attraction in DisneyLand parks
Tony should have lifted the table
When captain trys <br><br>Le* thor be like😳😅
The very moment he touched it captain knew he can lift it, but such a good human he is he didn&#39;t want to break Thor&#39;s pride...
I have a question, Is it just me.. or whats wrong with FPS on this video? its too quick for my eyes
The surprise and then relief on Thors face when Cap moves it a little always gets me!
I knew it
Vision was such a 🍑
The symbolism here is that Steve can&#39;t fully lift it because he&#39;s holding a small but significantly dark secret. Which as we learn, about Tony&#39;s parents. Steve reveals in his apology letter ✉️ he was &quot;sparing himself&quot; for selfish reasons. When the secret is out, and Rogers admitted he was being selfish, he becomes fully worthy.
In the comics, CA has wielded Mjolnir. I think the hammer wiggle was the hammer letting him know, &quot;That day will come one day, Captain. But today is not that day.&quot; But Thor&#39;s &quot;uh oh&quot; face was priceless.
They all knew Hulk couldn&#39;t lift it so it&#39;s obvious they couldn&#39;t.
How is Tony less worthy than Steve? He literally killed himself to save the world.
Thor massss
I love how smug Thor is with this and how he’s having fun with his friends.
Anyone else looked up what  &#39;prima nocta&#39;  means 🤣
Tony really wanted to pick it up and rule Asgard 😂😂😂 RIP IronMan❤
Table :🗿
Apparently the reason he couldn&#39;t lift the hammer was because he still kept a big lie to his friend Tony about knowing who killed his parents
Who is that at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=75">1:15</a> mark with The Avengers?
The retards in this comment section actually think Steve was worth of holding it in this movie. He clearly wasn&#39;t yet.
Thor: Whosoever lifts this hammer shall get the power<br>Cap (who’s worthy): nudges it just a bit<br>Thor’s face at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> : yoU wEReN’t SupPoSeD tO DO tHaT
❤❤❤❤❤
I wish I could easily sort YouTube comments by oldest to newest. I would have wanted to read comments predating the release of Endgame.
AFTER ironman did the snap in avengers endgame, he was def worthy of mjolnir
Remember when Marvel was good?
Scarlett can grab my hammer anytime hahahaha
nidnith bh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=44">0:44</a>: I never noticed Tony&#39;s Braveheart reference before. watch?v=J2OyfELjMfk
Cap was so generous❤ that he had a respect for Thor, he didn&#39;t want to undermine Thor&#39;s reputation that&#39;s why hammer not lifted!!!<br>🌟 But in the Endgame he lift the Majioneer in order to save thor life that was where He became Worthy<br>By the way He was worthy even before Cap title - A little feeble Cancer patient but fire in eyes 🔥🔥🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=4">0:04</a> is my favorite moment in the entire movie
マイティーソーじゃこのハンマーを壊した敵いたけどその敵もしかしてサノスより強いんじゃないのかな。
When thor becomes the villain everyone&#39;s fucked
thor you&#39;re fired lol
I love the part that Rhodey and Tony use parts of their suits to lift the hammer
“You know I’ve seen this before right?” Always loved this callback.
Bet Anatoly the power lifter can lift it
Unclothe = White
THIS IS THE BEST FORESHADOWING SCENE IN THE WHOLE WORLD! IN WHOLE UNIVERSE, RATHER!
lightning God ... 😊
Until someone shows up and says: &quot;can I clean here?&quot;💀
But can cap lift my dick?
Greatest line ever.  “I will be reinstating Prima Nocta”. 😂🤣
That moment where Chris without saying it says “the fuc?” Iconic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=65">1:05</a> Does noone else think Banner&#39;s attempt was humorous?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=117">1:57</a> cap be like lol this noob 😂
Superman is the only other who can lift the hammer with ease.
Did anybody see how Thor was worried when Steve moved it😂😂
I KNEW IT
When people talk about the best parts of the Marvel series, they rarely mention CGI scenes.
So it looks like Steve sets himself up for a massive pull, but barely budged it. We know it isn’t heavy if you’re worthy, if he put any actual effort in he should’ve immediately lifted it and went flying back. I believe he’s tried before, lifted it, and said nothing. Only did this to “prove” to Thor he’s the only one worthy, but messed up
Every person who goes in the scene with captain america tries to lift thor&#39;s hammer
0.39 if you slow down you can see Tony Stark push the hammer slighty 😂
Steve is me in my head in the class when the teacher gives a work
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=82">1:22</a> Thors reaction to when Cap moves mjolnir, is just golden. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cap and Nat actually are worthy
When you look at this scene and compare it to new MCU movies it breaks heart. Thor here vs mumbling Thor idiot in love and Thunder are completely different characters. And omg, a chill funny scene without anyone breaking it with punny comment? Without 6years old humour? How it&#39;s even possible???
This is a scene you would see in Avengers: EMH
hold up, why did that prima nocta joke just fly over my head till right now, lol. Look it up, its hilarious. its at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=43">0:43</a>
Vai ei mobe ta full cay
The 3 things in the scene that&#39;s worthy of Johnathan: Thor, Steve Rogers and the table

<i>&quot;Steve, he said a bad-language word!&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Did you tell everyone about that...?&quot;</i>
For everyone saying cap was worthy, no at this time he wasn&#39;t because he was still lying to stark about his parents/bucky. only after he admitted that he was able to lift it. People making up all kinds of shit like he didn&#39;t want to make thor look bad or w/e are just wrong lol
Cap is the only human been close enough to odin concept of worthy.
Hawkey pen spining at 00:3 it is one of my favrioute and most used pen spins
I didn’t know what prima nocta was before now.
Marshmallow sink straight to the floor?
Vision lift it though.
I think capt could lift it but he was trying to save thors ego, so he did not really try.
Cap is worthy almost 😂😂
It’s like pulling Excalibur from the stone.
Actually they didn&#39;t acting there xD They just have really fun in that scene😂
I knew it...!!!
A small detail for those of you who missed it all those years ago. Steve releases his grip when he realized the hammer moved a tiny bit and then when he attempted it again you can see his muscles aren&#39;t contracting as hard as they did during the first attempt. Endgame proved that the little things like this can truly culminate into something larger.
Anatoly: I&#39;m sorry, can I clean here
So couldn&#39;t they just lift up the table to move it?
The graphics are so good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> I love how Thor goes from “haha he won’t lift it” to “no way really??”
The question is why is Caps worthy but not Iron Man who sacrificed his life saving Earth in the first Avengers and then saved the universe in End Game?
He showed a smig of worthy or he was only pretending
The look on Thors face when the hammer moved a little from Steve almost lifting it
The table 😮😮
Steve could lift it because he is worthy. Steve doesn’t lift it because he is worthy.
It has been years since the release of Avengers Endgame, and the part that personally got me excited was the moment Captain America wielded the Mjolnir. Then I watched this scene only to see Thor&#39;s &quot;did the hammer just fucking moved&quot; look. Wkwkwkwkwkwkwkwkwkwkwkw<br><br>Good times.
I saw an episode of Film Theory about this scene, Captain America is worthy, he just pretends he is not to preserve Thor&#39;s ego.  Black Widow is worthy but, she thinks she&#39;s not.
The moment that proved that Abraham Erskine is the smartest man in the MCU. He found Steve.
No one is going to talk about Hawk Eye reenacting the proclamation of the hammer? 😂
Cap is worthy from the beginning
It only did that because he knew tony starks parents were killed and didn&#39;t tell the truth or he could pick it up
When Cap goes to lift it, you hear someone say “come on Cap!” I’ve always thought that was Sam Wilson/ Falcon. It kinda sounds like him and it’s always confused me because Sam wasn’t there. I’m thinking it was Clint who said it
I love how Thor doesn&#39;t even act or talk like a god.
tony seems took that personally when thor said <b>you&#39;re all not worthy</b> at the end.
I love this scene, just a group of friends having fun trying to lift this hammer
the last time with everyone having fun and chilling :/
😂😂😂😂
Qqeeqqeeqqee
60FPS garbage
Thor&#39;s I knew it, will always brings me back here
I’m just kidding to love marvel
Xausfthglkpu
Dsdddddhd🌹♥️♥️♥️
I like that Ultimate Avengers Mjolnir-Hammer.<br><br>Imagine that.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=48">0:48</a>,was the Thor’s Ultimate-Mjolnir from Ultimate Avengers.<br><br>As a fan of the Mjolnir I choose a Katana-sword. That’s Cool the Mjolnir with a Katana-sword, Awesome.
Watching this now I wonder what was going through Steve’s mind. Obviously he plays aloof but I wonder if he knew how special it was that he could lift it.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=82">1:22</a> that little moment
What if you lift the table? 🤔
Just represent - pull 😂
It budged for Cap?? Did he not pick it up on purpose?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=101">1:41</a>  &quot;STEVE, he said a bad language word&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> I saw that
wait does anybody know the asian actress at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=75">1:15</a>
I think I was the only one who liked this movie!
Rhody, Bucky, Ayo, Natasha, Groot, Steve all worthy
I only recognize like 80% of the people

He didn&#39;t almost pick it up. He could, but didn&#39;t want to.
I don’t understand tony save thousands millions of people in New York City but why still he is not worthy ? is this bug ?
Is it me or does when Hawkeye goes to lift the hammer at first just right before the cut it budges just a tiny bit.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=37">0:37</a> does it moved?
The best marvels movie before Disney ruined it.
if you go frame by frame at 39 seconds when Tony Stark is putting his arm in the strap, you can see it move right before the camera angle changes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> that moment still gets me. Thor sees Cap clearly makes the hammer budge but Cap decides nah, he’s not embarrassing the god tonight.
Folded wick
fake 60 fps looks like shit xd
Thor was about to not let go of asgard 💀 take the hammer and fly away
Tony actually won the challenge coz he created vision . U can even see in a scene where thor says &quot;Well done &quot; by tapping him in the shoulder.Also Tony learns from his mistakes
These moments are what makes good movies. Not Taika.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry guys, I need to clean here. My name is Anatoly&quot;
Just caught something.  Widow noticed. SOMETHING.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=43">0:43</a> <br>Tony: &quot;I will be reinstituting Prima Nocta&quot; <br>Hammer: &lt;welds to space itself&gt;
Black Widow aka Natasha worthy to lift the Mjolnir
Steve knew he was able to pick it up. He moved it slightly but enough to get Thor to wonder. Steve didn’t completely pick it up because didn’t want to embarrass Thor or ruin the mutual respect and dynamics of the team.
Guys! Just a question!!! A little question!!! We ask to much for the new UCM and DC to be more like this and not like this woke shit they are doing?
Can&#39;t rule Asgard if you&#39;re dead lol I see what Mjölnir did there.
Yeah
😂😂😂😂😂
Who else heard the prima nocta joke
I never could&#39;ve imagined the sense of pure childhood nostalgia I would get watching all these heroes together in such a calm, loving, and friendly scene. Half of them are gone now and watching this is like going back and watching home movies from when you were young. Its insane
And now years later Hawkeye can’t lift up a salad fork 😳😳😳🤣🤣🤣
133 M😏
Thor:…… I knew it!!!
He saved thor here and also there ❤❤
... Prima nocta? <br><br>Wow. Seriously cringe
Technically at :40 he did movie it but I’m sure it was an editing error 😂
Slow it down to 0.25x speed and you can see at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=38">0:38</a> as Tony&#39;s putting his hand in the camera loop thingy attached to Mjölnir, he actually moves it. You can see it move before it disappears behind his jacket. Iron Man, the one who started it all, was always worthy 😉
tip: change the speed to .75 for actual movie speed.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> Shit the hammer actually moved .I think we all missed that until watching End Game.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can the power stone lift it 🤔
I fuckin love Tony man “ it’s physics”😭😭😭
To me, the look Thor makes more communicates a curious, &quot;Did he just...?&quot; feeling to me, rather than the look of worry that someone was just about to upstage him by lifting Mjolnir. Just my reading of it.
That&#39;s some good coffee table strength advertisement.
Remember the hammer weighs more than a planet to those who are not worthy.  If it even moves a millimeter it means you are worthy...
Caption America kinda left it cause he’s the worthy one
Tony ❤❤❤
&quot;I knew it&quot;
انتهاك  لشخصية ثور
Marvelous 🎉🎉🎉🎉
What is primanakta
that part was more entertaining than the actual movie plot
how can thor be worthy 😂 he&#39;s clearly immature and has anger management issue
I’ve lift Mjolnir <br><br>Not because I’m worthy, but because I’m the GOAT 🐐 <br><br>All hail DOOM
Anyone noticed the disgusting joke in Tony&#39;s dialogue about prima nocta? No wonder why it wasn&#39;t so well received.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> Epic Foreshadowing
There were probably no lines in this scene all improv. They just had to make sure they kept using their characters names.
This scene proves Renner was always a great Hawkeye...this is the most Clint Barton like he&#39;s written in the entirety of the saga.
Ah, back when marvel still made movies that were good and made sense
terrible interpolation
I can just imagine Odin watching them from above in Asgard. And looking as worried as Thor was when Cap almost lifted Mjolnir.
Such a trash ass movie
6
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY">0:00</a> Who?
Well, you got to have fun when Jane isn&#39;t around to lift your hammer.
As much as everybody hates this movie, I really do like this movie
This is my number 1 favorite part in age of ultron
Imagine everybody cant lift the hammer but vision holds it to thor... &quot;You didnt have to cut me off...&quot;
8 + 8 = 9 😂
I knew how this would turn out when I first saw AOU but still, it&#39;s freaking hilarious how they TRY to pick up Mjollnir... 🤣
Yall, Cap was always worthy, and he knew it here. If he wasnt, why would he even attempt to lift something he knew he couldnt lift in the middle of the fight with Thanos in Endgame? He pretty much saved Thor, yall really think he went &quot;Well my homies fucked and needs some help, Imma go try to lift something i couldnt lift before&quot;?
Tony was worthy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=76">1:16</a> who is this beautiful lady?
Did you guys know That thor face looks like this 😐 because  thor looks that captain america was almost gonna lift it
I love how Tony looks like he&#39;s about to shit himself
In case anyone is wondering &quot;prima nocta&quot; is latin for “first night,”. It was a law back in the day. A nobleman can have sex with anyone he wanted at least once with no judgement, it was his right. Obviously this law didn&#39;t last long. Cause noblemen, were trying to have sex with any girl they saw, married or not. The guy who created the law was obviously a pig. But then another noblemen found the law to be incredibly degrading to people, so he told the guy who created the law, I want to have sex with your wife and daughters, it was within my right. The guy who created the law quickly banned the law. <br><br>He quiickly learned what happens when you are in the other person&#39;s shoes.  He never thought someone would try and sleep with his own family. Got a taste of his own medicine.
I don&#39;t know how Thor picks up his hammer when Hawkeye, Iron Man, The War Machine, Bruce Banner/The Hulk couldn&#39;t lift it until Vision, Captain America &amp; Jane picked up the hammer later on though.
The hulk is always the best one they are all like we will beat you down big man
Tony should have been able to lift it. He was worthy
We need Maria Hill back
Hawkeye stayed real quiet after acting like a prick 😂
i love how thor&#39;s face changes when the hammer wiggles. at first i thought it was worry, but i think it&#39;s actually more - he gets serious in that second because he recognizes that cap WAS worthy of mjolnir, and he had finally found his first true peer. i also love the detail that you can tell cap totally faked not being to pick it up because cap&#39;s so wholesome that he&#39;s a bad liar, even when he&#39;s lying to keep from embarrassing a friend.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=76">1:16</a> who is she?!
Steve not picking it up is a small example of exactly why he was worthy
Tony&#39;s reaction is best of all time🤣
Table, coat rack, elevator: pathetic..
Ayoo “lifting Thor’s hammer’ is CRAZY ⏸⏸
in memory of one of my favourite comments i&#39;ve ever read underneath a video like that:<br><br>&quot;when stark tried to lift it, the hammer should sunk a bit of disworthiness!&quot; :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=79">1:19</a> Cap almost lifted Mjolnir! LOL
Cap was the worthy one to lift it but outta respect to Thor and probably also not to cause any rift he didnt go further..but when it mattered in Endgame he actually did it.
man i really loved these guys
The Table: 👁️👄👁️
How can I find the song in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=74">1:14</a>
&quot;is okay if I clean here?
Captain knew he could lift it but he didn&#39;t want this to he the time he did it because there was no reason yet
I love the popular theory of how Steve can already lift the hammer but didn&#39;t because he doesn&#39;t want to embarrass Thor
And they said this was a bad MCU movie. Lol look at where they&#39;re going now. Lmao
imagine this scene but without the rape joke
Allah sizi sinemanızla sınasın inşallah.
The reason Black widow declined to try is because in the comics is she also worthy. Though Steve pretended he couldn&#39;t wield it. Widow on the other hand would just end up doing it.
The reason Cap didn&#39;t lift it was because he was super drunk
このトンカチはトンカチに見えるけど、実は地球1個分の質量がある中性子の塊
Great thing about this scene, we THINK it&#39;s just the set-up for Vision lifting Mjolnir (and that may indeed have been Whedon&#39;s original intent), but even Whedon said, &quot;Did he fail or did he STOP?&quot; That&#39;s why I was bummed when Hela shattered Mjolnir, and later became hopeful when Thor brought it back from the past.
Anyone else notice that Maria is wearing Steve&#39;s jacket? Earlier in the party scene she isn&#39;t wearing a jacket but steve is, and now she is but steve isn&#39;t
Imagine if he committed to that, and lifted it up.
I miss the OG Avengers squad, they had such great chemistry.
“Steve, he said a bad language word!
Why did Thor look concerned when Steve tried to pick it up?
imo black widow would&#39;ve be able to lift it
plot twist: the cast wasn&#39;t acting they were just hanging out together and the camera man decided to start filming lol
I&#39;ve seen this clip dozens of times, but one of the things i&#39;ve come to realize is that likely a few of them WOULD be able to lift the hammer, but they got it switched around - they go too far in the other direction with it - they see mjolinr as ONLY a litmus test of worthyness. Thor sees that, but part of what comes along with that is its STILL a HAMMER, and part of being worthy entails recognizing that it IS a weapon, its MEANT to be used to defend those ideals
The finger print thing made more sense than the &#39;worthy&#39; thing.
why does the video look so weird
Damn this video got hella views
Watching this scene in 2023 is so sad knowing that there is a lot of them in this scene is dead, especially after Secret Wars episode 1.  Sad.  But a great scene.
Well hell really look at captin America &quot;try&quot; 🤣🤣 like thousands of comments here obviously he knew he could pick it up but we&#39;ve seen captin America actually try to lift and hold things lol looks at the helicopter sence in civil war i mean thats him trying here he barely looks like hes trying because hes not but hes making it look like he his. I love that type of detail in movies!
I wish black widow, and Maria Hill got the chance to lift the hammer that would be funny to
8 years later, I googled prima nocta. You learn something everyday. Better late than never.
I think the fact Steve was only able to make it budge was  either cuz he wasn’t quite worthy enough yet or he didnt want to embarrass thor
I remember letting out an &quot;oh shit&quot; when Mjöllnir budged during Caps attempt
I love Bruce and Natasha just flirting at the start and not even noticing what’s happening
Fvcking table. That&#39;s the stronger thing than others
Anatoliy comes: <br>- Can I clean here?
guys just a thaught,<br><br>LIAM HEMSWORTH as thor variant, i mean cmon that just a given amm i right
The way everyone looked at Bruce 😂. I could feel second hand awkwardness, and thors face when cap nearly picked it up. He was baffled 😂🤣. This is my favorite scene
If you watch carefully, when Cap tries to lift the hammer, you can see his hand sliding slightly backwards, just when the hammers gets nudged a bit. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a reason he uses both his hands that way: he uses his right hand to push against the left one, to give the impression that he&#39;s struggling to lift it.
Why was Captain America able to lift the hammer in endgame and not on here?
It was the last movie when they all are together &amp; happy.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=115">1:55</a>
Clint has seen thor unable to lift the hammer.
I love how dr cho is there watching tony making fool of himself
So Tony and Brody each put on their, &quot;favorite&quot; gloves, tried together to, &quot;work the shaft&quot; but couldn&#39;t get it off...the table??
That is one damned worthy table.
Steve is so pure, he doesn’t embarrass Thor by showing he can lift it.  That was suspected at the time, proven in Endgame.  Great mini-arc.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=79">1:19</a> Cap in 2015: <b>nudges Mjölnir</b><br><br>Cap in 2023: <b>wields Mjölnir against Thanos</b><br><br>That follow-up on this scene in <b><i>Endgame</i></b> was pure MCU magic.
Thor was happy seeing captain lifting Mjionir in Endgame. Epic scene it was.
Thor heart almost dropped when captain picked his hammer up a tiny bit
Steve didn&#39;t want to upset everyone else who couldn&#39;t lift Mjolnir by being the one who could, and Thor played along.
GgrdhxzdnnbcxzzkNL
He knew captain America could pick it up.<br><br>As soon as it even nudges that meant he could pick it up.<br><br>It&#39;s binary. Either you&#39;re worthy or you&#39;re not worthy. <br><br>There&#39;s no your partially worthy so it nudges just a little.
ngl the prima nocta rape joke was a bit weird.
This scene warms my heart so much. ☺️
It’s funny after Cap walks away, the way Thor laughed and said “Nothing” was out of relief and trying to act like he wasn’t worried at all
Very heavy hammer
かっけぇわw
? may be even more worthy than Thor.Would Thor pretend he couldn&#39;t lift it if doing so kept a friend from being embarrassed
Remember when the mcu was cool af?.
I believe steve was always worthy but didn&#39;t know until he moved it a little. I&#39;m going back to movie Thor 1 when his father took away the hammer from Thor to teach him a lesson about how irresponsible and unworthy he was. Thor could no longer pick it up until he proved that he was worthy. I really love this with all the heroes enjoying their time together.
That faded smile was fast
When Steve tried to lift the hammer and we saw that little nudge, my dad and I were just freaking out!
Apparently real estate is worthy as that whole skyscraper is lifting it up
To this day, still one of my favorite Marvel movies
I KNEW IT
🙂
who the hell are these other random people in the scene?
Man it&#39;s really sad seeing Jeremy Renner walking around. Feel so bad for that man
Love how you can actually see him just slightly move the hammer at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> and third reaction in the back before realizing there’s a few movies to be made
What people need to understand is that Cap could pick it and knew he could pick it up he just stopped. Even the writers said the same thing
Captain is most powerful in marvel
did tony just joke about reinstating prima nocta 💀what a genuine piece of shit 😭
Cap could left it because he is worthy but for his friend thor he never did.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=53">0:53</a> he doesn&#39;t even have the full suit on of course that&#39;s not gonna help, he&#39;s still pulling using his own strength
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> 😂😂😂😂
Anatoly enters the room.  Can I clean here?
60fps always ruins the movie
We need anatoly
The only avenger that should have ever been able to pick up the hammer is Tony
কথায় আছে না যে তোমার কথা নিয়ে খেলতে পারে তার আবার যাত
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=93">1:33</a> unsure whether it was scripted in or not but i just noticed how captain smirked after lifting it, realising he is worthy
60fps is weird for movies
Thor was so shocked that captain America was about to pick the hammer up
Mjölner betyder krossaren
Tor kan bara fånga Mjölner med järngrepp.
My fuck i lost it when captain america moves it and thors face. Like the funniest scene ever!
Love how comfortable they&#39;ve gotten with Bruce, so they just look at him like the goof he is when he pretends to hulk out
When thor said you&#39;re all not worthy, cap must be saying to himself I&#39;ll show you my worthiness when your ass is getting kicked!
This table is really stable. Garbage films from holywood for more than a decade
Probably hundreds of comments like this but- the face that Thor makes the second Mjolnir wiggles a little to cap is so funny to me
Gadar 2 blockbuster hogi first day 1 300CR 🔥💯 11 August 8 Sunny Deol only 💪 ♥️ Hindustan jindabad 💪
Can’t believe this scene earns 132 million views
I never noticed; why is Hawkeye holding drum sticks?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=76">1:16</a> which avenger was that?
This scene was weirdly wholesome
Anatoli could lift it
did you frame blend this?<br>odd
We ARE normal.
I think the Hulk could lift Thor’s hammer without being worthy, but it would one of the heaviest things he has ever lifted as he struggles to hold it
When Marvel humor was situational
Then a cleaning lady whose name is Worthy just came in and casually tossed it in the garbage bin.
&quot;Кашу Машей не испортишь&quot;,— приговаривали три охотника, готовя себе ужин.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=82">1:22</a> thor almost shat himself knowing captain almost lifted it
Back before Civil war and eventually Endgame started, I liked to think that whenever Thor&#39;s around, they&#39;d get every new member to try to lift the hammer as a sort of rite of passage XD
Like they say there is no almost worthy you either can lift it or you can. If you moved it you could pick it up.
When Steve tried it budge a little and Thor saw it that&#39;s why he had that worried look on his face.
I know nobody cares, but why it&#39;s not 24P, it&#39;s sooooooooooooo ugly that way.
I wonder what would have happened if Scarlet actually tried after knowing what happened in endgame.
I like the way it slightly moved for Captain America because the character is actually a very Noble hero almost pure (unlike the actor that plays him) Very good detail
The weakest one gets up first to take on the challenge.
tony stark wanting primae nocta back is kinda messed up XD
this is why you dont 60fps on a movie cause the movement is as artificial as ai generators its look worse
I can easily lift Thor&#39;s hammer
I love it when vision just hands it to Thor and everyone is speechless 😂😂
This is my all time favorite scene in a marvel film. Full stop. No competetors. Im not sure why, it just feels very real maybe.
I like that this scene can be interpreted in two ways:<br><br>One:  Steve could lift the hammer but choose not to out of respect for Thor.<br><br>Two:  Steve still had two more trials to go through before being deemed worthy, despite being able to make it wiggle.  One trial in Civil War when his ideals were challenged in an ever-changing world.  And the second in Infinity War, where he would suffer a huge loss.  But both involving how he would react.
Maybe Hawkeye can&#39;t lift Thor&#39;s hammer, but I&#39;m sure Jeremy Renner could, I&#39;m more sure of that after what he did to save his nephew. Truly worthy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=82">1:22</a> predicted Endgame
All…except one ❤
So after all, we can say Steve realize he could carry it and pretended to struggle. 😅
I will be reinstituting prima nocta 😂
I miss fun character-relationship building moments like this one. :(
Am I the only one that finds HD kinda...shakey?
Thor was genuinely worried when Steve stepped up to try, set up endgame perfectly.
60fps be looking weird
COOL!
cap isnt worthy
That &quot;get it up&quot; joke...The current MCU would NEVER!!! 😢😢
Captain America 🔥
I think a better end credits scene would have been Cap in Avengers HQ picking up Thor&#39;s hammer straight up while no one was around. It&#39;s completely unseen, and Cap just smiles and puts it down.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> notice how Thor&#39;s face changes when he sees Steve moving just a bit the hammer. That was a good sign.
The last time the Avengers really had fun together before shit super hit the fan
Meanwhile, Banner and Black Widow are heads-together in their own conversation...a nice detail since we already know what&#39;s going on between them two. sorry Tony, no prima nocturna for you!
Remember when Marvel was so wholesome, Stark was alive to make a joke of everything, it could&#39;ve been such a good sitcom😂
well in the avengers animated movie the hulk lifted the hammer  and he threw it from pure rage it was nuts
Hawkeye’s not worthy because he killed all those kids in Iraq
Mark ruffalo is just awful
That is a strong table😂😂😂
It&#39;s Thors face when the slight move, possibly one of my favourite scenes from the entire Marvel series
I wish that the MCU&#39;d had more scenes like this.
This hits after Endgame.
Amazing Video
If i lifted it i  i can rule asgard?? 💀
captain be like :- ok ok  i will let you to rule azgard .
TVs on Walmart be like:
fun fact: Captain America could lift the hammer, he just didn’t want to hurt Thor’s feelings.
Халк еще в первых мстителях поднимал молот
so what would happen if Tony used an Iron man Suit like the Mark 50 that does not need anyone inside of it, would an empty suit be able to lift it?
Captain America budged it, did you ser Thors face. He was like, oh sshhiittt
You can tell by the way Thor left his hammer just sitting there on the table, he knew they wouldn&#39;t be able to resist.
I love that worried look on Thor&#39;s face when Steve budges it lol😂😂😂!
Captain America let go of the hammer the moment he felt it move. It slid out of his grip and back it place. Afterwards he put on an act to the others as if he wasn&#39;t worthy.<br><br>Mjolnir could sense that Steve didn&#39;t want to be able to pick it up, which made Steve worthy.
this is one of my favourite scenes in the mcu easily. its so simple but i just love how its a ton of superheros who literally fight space gods hanging out with each other as if they were anyone else.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=60">1:00</a> two boy one hammer 🔨
Anatoly - Can I Clean Here???
Captain America, being worthy in endgame why wasn’t he worthy here
Is this the last time they are having fun?
“I’ll be reinstituting prima nocta” 😂😂😂 I miss Tony
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=100">1:40</a> I can imagine Black Widow saying that to Steve after what Starlord said in GOTG 3
It did budge with Captain , right?
why wouldnt they be able to pick up the hammer with the table still attached?? i get if it was on the ground and they couldnt pick it up, but n a table...i mean, the table would still be able to be moved.
Weeeeeeerthyyyyy?
I&#39;m sorry, did TONY STARK of all people actually say, &quot;I&#39;ll be reinstitution prima nocta&quot;? I mean, one the one hand, I&#39;m not THAT surprised, yet on the other hand, I&#39;m certain that Pepper Potts should&#39;ve kicked his ass for that remark.
The good times when they all were sitting around being friends and having fun. Now half the original avengers are gone.
IN THE COMIC BOOK, CAPTAIN AMERICA DOES LIFT THOR’S HAMMER. HE WAS WEARING THE BLACK, WHITE &amp; RED SUIT THEN WITH ADAMANTIUM SHIELD OF THE SAME COLOR
Funny thing is it seems like bad acting on chris evans part when everyone pshhs thor’s comment that they are all not worthy but I think that was intentional that his character has a monent of bad acting cuz he secretly knows he actually can lift it.
Bakwas ... Flop one
En una comedia lo recordara ole lleva el enbrjo como la espada en la tiedra
just remember they never showed hawkeye trying to lift it.<br>he is worthy
I’m sorry. Can I clean here. Hehehe
Why do people insist on interpolating movie scenes? Interpolation looks like ass.
I feel like cap was just trying to hidd the fact hes worthy, he lifted it a bit but then it looked like he was putting less pressure on it because hes worthy cuz in one movie he holds his hammer.
This has been out for almost a decade
وين الكاه مترجم
Imagine not wanting to make Thor look bad.
When cap realized he could lift it, he held back.
Kapitan amerika siljitgan
Can I clean here?
cap was worthy but in age of Ultron he shown that he can also lift that hammer but he can’t cause a little bit of worthiness is still left in cap which he had filled by keeping good friendship with thor that’s why he was able to lift that hammer till age of Ultron he was just a friend of thor but after the fight with ultron his friendship became more deeper this is the ans
They would have placed it somewhere else but the table😂😂😂
Lol whats funny is that PPL think CAPS is actually worthy of lifting THORs HAMMER. 😂 Nah bruh CAPS aint worthy shit it is just that script writer is too bias towatds him otherwise i mean what difference will it be between a DEMI GOD and LAB EXPERIMENT RAT.<br><br>i love caps btw.
Hawkeye is a shit, says it&#39;s a trick without knowing anything. and 😂 Why he is an Avenger??<br>He is average🤣🤣

The sleeping face at the beginning?!
You know I could I&#39;m so pure
Respect for Thor hatoda captan america
Steve is the Superman of Marvel but less annoying and self righteous
So according to the hammer, all other superheros suck?
These are the days when Disney was on top. Not many woke BS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=64">1:04</a> actual peak
The smile on Cap&#39;s face after Banner takes his term: appreciating his humor and humility.  Poking fun at himself and being comfortable in his own skin without having to be &quot;overly masculine&quot; in a room full of superheroes.  Something Cap could appreciate about him.  Meanwhile, Black Widow, &quot;You&#39;re a dork, but I love you for it.&quot;
Thor&#39;s face be like 😱😱
it is very crazy how anyone could lift Thors hammer captain americas musles sholud be able to lift thors hammer
Wouldn&#39;t it have been really ironic if Nat was able to lift it?
Superman is writing...
I think tony is more worthy more than anyone present in this clip
I always wanted a scene where Stanley comes in as a janitor picks up the hammer and cleans below it while the avengers are gone!
The look on thors face when cap had a go 😂
Lol <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=65">1:05</a>
Just the way Tony had to put on part of his iron man suit and still couldn’t lift it 😂😂
💎
so let&#39;s test it... chop off thor&#39;s hand and see if it works ;p
He scared  thor
hi Scarlett you are so beautiful
The fact that he was able to budege the hammer s little bit meant he was worhy enough in the moment 🤣
Fun fact: Captain America is worthier than Thor.
I think even if they don&#39;t put it in the movie, all writers in the MCU need to write a scene like this. Knowing how your character reacts when they&#39;re relaxing and how they respond to mundane challenges like this is the absolute best possible way to check that the character you&#39;re writing is properly fleshed out.
I love how Steve knows he can lift it, but it’s just too nice to do that. And the Stevie said a bad language word is amazing
For once, we actually see what The Avengers are like outside of their costumes.
I wonder... no one except cap and thor would have been able to lift the hammer... but could someone have kicked it off the table and caught it?
So cringe when he was trying to hulk out
So when Cap tries to pull Mjölnir it lifts for a millisecond and Thor himself sees that cap is and will be worthy! NOICE
You can see how everyone&#39;s personalities are reflected here:<br><br>-Clint is the cocky ass; doesn&#39;t believe in the whole &quot;worthy&quot; business and eats his words when he can&#39;t pick up the hammer.<br>-Stark is self-absorbed: Refuses to accept &quot;defeat&quot; in this instance, and resorts to borderline cheating lol (Arguably you can see his &quot;genius&quot; side too: Naturally there&#39;s no way you&#39;d be unable to pick a hammer like that, so he keeps trying different thinga until it&#39;s proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it&#39;s NOT natural.)<br>-Banner is the awkward nerd; tries to prank everyone with a Hulk scare... That didn&#39;t land at all.<br>-Cap, as humble as he is, probably knew he could lift the hammer as soon as he held it, so he pretended to struggle picking it up as to not embarrass Thor.<br>-Romanov, former assassin trained in espionage, probably doesn&#39;t like to be the center of attention and thus refuses to try.<br>-And lastly Thor, proud Asgardian warrior, accepts any challenge with the confidence that he&#39;ll come out victorious. (And promptly loses his cool when he realizes he might &quot;lose&quot; in that instance.)
Thor new instantly cap could pick it up😂
Kinda surprised Hakweye isn&#39;t worthy, considering that his assassin stuff aside, the guy is as humble and meek as they come.  Has a loving wife, kids that adore him, will do anything in his power to defend them as well as the rest of the universe.  The man would be worthy of being Odin&#39;s drinking buddy.
Respect to Steve cuz he know he could lift but decided not to so that thor doesn&#39;t feel bad and embarassed and that&#39;s the quality of a leader.
I always wish black widow tried 😂😂😂
Steve wasn&#39;t even TRYING...
Good old time MCU
But why captain america is not able to pick this but in end game he does this easilly. I dont understand why.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=118">1:58</a> the reaction from Cap knowing he’s worthy.
😅
Bruce Banner was hilarious!  ❤
It&#39;s funny that Hawkeye is one of the people doubting the hammer&#39;s spell when he witnessed Thor fail to lift it in the first movie firsthand.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=86">1:26</a> shouldve been thors face in endgame when cap picked up the hammer
I always thought that the whole scene with Vision just randomly picking up Mjölnir undermined Cap ultimately lifting it. Especially with the subtle nod here and slow build up. That was my biggest pet pieve back then with AoU when it came out. Gladly and thankfully four years later it didn&#39;t hurt one bit when Cap finally had his moment, because everybody was sitting stressed out in the cinemas and fearing for everyone&#39;s lifes and didn&#39;t think for a second about it. :D
World breaker Hulk can lift it with bruce force.
People talk about Cap being worthy because of his honesty and humbleness, but that&#39;s actually not why he&#39;s worthy. Remember this is a war hammer made for a thunder god, not the humble god. Cap is a warrior through and through, but he fights not for grandeur and glory, but to protect. That is why he is worthy.
Do we think Iron man proved himself worthy after saving half the universa with the click ?
I also want to try guys 😮🤔👌
Qqeeqqqeeqq
Looking for the table ,can handle hammer <br>Table: I am Asgard king...<br>Me:
Cap was worthy in this scene, and it took Avengers 4: Endgame to just make it truly happen.
You had trouble lifting this puny azz piece of plastic 2/me me.......Tom Grady could even lift this without cheating.....LOL.......well.maybe not Brady butt Grady could.....Fred Stan d for Cardinals .......won again and again n again n again n again n again n again.....is that 7 yet????? Yessssss it is Fred drop your b52$ and date Elton to get him off my leg......he keeps having glow ups Elmer&#39;s g oo l UE w no thx.....se7en
Everyone says Steve was worthy, but I truly believe he wasn’t until he resolved his disagreement with Tony about his parents
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=38">0:38</a> watch  carefully iron man can movie the hammer
In the comic books captain America was one of the first to lift the hammer 👍🏾
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=87">1:27</a> the smile says it all😊
Nobody knowing what prima nocta is 😂
&quot;Steve, he said a bad language word&quot; one of the most underated lines in the MCU
The way I see it, Mjolnir was just furious at being used as a party trick so it refused to let itself be lifted. By contrast, the war against Thanos was a life or death scenario.<br>Also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=43">0:43</a> That&#39;s...just messed up Lord Stark!
Thor: You all aren&#39;t worthy<br>Steve: Boy you lucky i didn&#39;t embarrass you right there
Cap tho
His face when captain America dragged it a little 🤣🤣
whos reflection is that when the video begins?
Captain America can pull it but he didn&#39;t because he did not want to embarace thor
Who&#39;s here after averagers endgame ending ? 🙋
Looks like Capt America knew he was about to pick it up but didn&#39;t on purpose. Prolly just doesn&#39;t believe in being a king.
That is one durable glass table.
The audio quality
Okay, so no one gonna mention how it moved when Iron Man put the strap around his wrist??
what minutes is this ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=92">1:32</a> I forgot why Romanoff decided NOT to lift Thor’s hammer?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=39">0:39</a>, for a frame or 2, when Stark puts the wrap around his wrist, the handle gets moved by his leg. Guess they didn&#39;t do a very good job at editing LoL
That little squeak scared him lol
bro did anyone notice the table? It’s lifting the hammer and drinks
The Iron Man and War Machine part of this sequence never made sense to me.<br><br>If Tony only puts on the glove, he&#39;s still trying to lift it with his shoulders, torso and legs. The gloves are literally giving him grip.<br><br>If you want the glove to be if any real use, you&#39;d have to out on most of the rest of the suit so that it can transfer the pulling weight down the suit and use the mechanical power to lift.
They dont know there is a guy Named Thanos goona kick their Ass.
I think Cap became worthy after Civil Wars, standing against his friends for what is right . ( Dumbledore said standing against friends require bravery of the highest order in harry potter)

I wonder when Steve realized he could lift the hammer? Looks like he tried to do it earlier when Thor didn&#39;t see)
I miss the old MCU so much :&#39;) i cant believe its making me this nostalgic. I loved all the old mcu actors and their chemistry a whole lot, shame it&#39;ll never be like this again
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> Thor&#39;s face😊 I knew it
I guess Steve just didn&#39;t want to steal Thor&#39;s thunder.
Everyone knows that Steve Rogers/Captain America is worthy, but the coat hanger did it better.
The only reason that Steve didn’t lift it all the way was to spare Thor his ‘precious feelings’. 😉 😊 😀😀😀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=38">0:38</a> Didn’t it move a little?
I like the foreshadowing of how the hammer slightly moved, meaning Steve Rogers will be worthy soon and then he was during Endgame.
Thor challenge to pick his hammer
Cap&#39;s such a legit guy he didn&#39;t want to show Thor up, he was humble but still having fun. He could have lifted it, he always could have, the mvoement showed that there&#39;s no such thing as being half-worthy. Cap just didn&#39;t want to show up his friend.
Tony breing back prima nocte 😄
Many people think that Steve was already worthy here. He wans&#39;t. <br>It was said (from the real creators of Avengers AoU) that Captain America in Age of Ultron WASN&#39;T worthy... And it was not the hammer that moved, but the table... That&#39;s why Thor was afraid for a while, because something move - but not the hammer. It was just put there as a funny situation - which they followed up on in Endgame, but which does not mean that Steve was worthy in this film.<br>Just the Russo brothers said they THOUGHT Steve was worthy already in Age of Ultron... but they had nothing to do with this movie or this scene. And they conflict with other creators (whether Endgame, IW or other Captain America movies) - they are not united in opinion. Also Kevin Feige said that - but it was his unfounded assumption (and he was only producer). Real writters simply said that Captain America in Age of Ultron WASN&#39;T worthy (yet). And Whedon (the main writer) create this scene JUST FOR FUN. it wasn&#39;t supposed to be some kind of insinuation that Steve was worthy and just pretending he wasn&#39;t.<br>The &quot;problem&quot; is that this scene was followed up by the Russos in Endgame - but that was their own idea and decision. But that&#39;s no proof that Captain America was worthy in AoU, even though they kind of allude to it.
the little squeak at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> is thor farting.
So this 300 billion elephants weighted hammer can be put on the table
While I prefer the original reasoning that no one could lift Mjolnir just because Thor was so impossibly strong no living thing came close, the worthyness factor does give some strong moments like cap being able to call the hammer to him later
Cap just performed a mime art ! You can see his facial expression and his hand being easy on the hammer !
Would Natasha have been worthy? I think it&#39;s possible...
How can thanos be considered worthy?? Can anyone explain..
At first it just buges a few movies later he can lift it.
O kadar ağır kütleye sahip olan bir cisim masayı ikiye böler
Tony: <b>in mind</b> Why no work?!? WHY NO WORK?!?
It definitely moved but he didn&#39;t wanted to do it
Mjholnir when Cap tried: hmmm almost
Would Tony be a good ruler.
Damn bro, I didn&#39;t Know IKEA made worthy tables
nice videos
It’s a real family
I want Felix Jr. to try to lift that hammer
Elevator is worthy...?
Steve: moves the hammer<br>Thor: thinks about relocating
My favourite part is the fake hulk out by banner…and nobody was buying it 🤣🤣 Steve choosing not to lift the hammer though 🤯 such a clever part to put in for those who noticed it
When Steve tries, he almost lifts it, but then he decreased the pressure, as his hands slightly move upwards, which means...<br><br>meh you&#39;ve all seen endgame
I think the clip has somehow upscale a bit!
When you realize what he meant by prima nocta, it&#39;s interesting why he wanted that
I still think when capt tried to lift it and it moved alittle he already had the power to lift it but choose to fake it too not freak out thor
That table is more worthy than half of them XD it didn&#39;t break 😂
Those were the days
after endgame we know that natasha is worthy
If Tony somehow survived after snapping would he be worthy?
😎. The word worthy and god.
Wasn&#39;t it Thor before he became a sissy wimp, replaced by a woke hollywood thorette?..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=78">1:18</a>. The way Scarlet Johansson is looking at Jake.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=100">1:40</a> 😂😂
To be honest after this scene the fights are kinda boring. Avengers are really more than superheroes they are true friends and thats the part i love about Marvel🥺
Russo Brothers had said that, captain was always worthy but he stopped himself in age of ultron so that thor doesn&#39;t get embarrassed.<br>P.S. Odin said whoever is worthy and lifts mjolnir shall possess the power of thor.<br>So in Endgame, when Captain lifts mjolnir Captain got all the powers of thor and he has his own powers. So captain was the most powerful avenger at that time.
The real Chad Cap 🛡️
that niggah almost shyt his pants when cap almost picked it up...😂🤣😅
Fun fact thor got his hammer from chuck norris&#39;s tool box
I think black widow can up that hammer but they belittled
Let’s not ignore what Tony want to reinstate
The facial expressions after Banner&#39;s try is priceless. 😅
The good old days of the MCU
Vision showed off and got his head cracked by Thanos. Cap stayed humble like a true leader despite being worthy and eventually manhandled Thanos with Mjolnir. Whole theatre gasped during that scene. I miss the original MCU.
&quot;hahaha... nothing...😅😅&quot;
It literally weighs 42.3 Pounds
Fun Fact: Superman is also worthy
Cap purposely relented
End Game Thor: &quot;I knew it!!&quot;
Ummm Tony moved it more at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=39">0:39</a>
Now wait a minute! Anyone can pull it once it’s been pulled.
Captain America could lift it exactly because he didn&#39;t want to lift it. Think about it
none of the guys could lift thor&#39;s hammer...so we conclude Thor is not gay
The really fascinating thing for me as a German is that they all drink Warsteiner (German brewery). <br>🍺🍺🍺
These guys are supposed to save the universe, but can&#39;t lift 42.3 lb?
Fun fact when Steve Was About To Try And Pull Mjolnir He Could Actually Pull It And If You Look Close Enough It Actually Moved, But Cap Does Not Want To Embarrass Thor So He Did Not Fully Pull It.
&quot;That Table And Coat Hanger Is Stronger Than The Entire MCU&quot;
I want Tony, Steve, Thor, Bruce, Nat, Clint and Maria hanging out as friends, not heroes or anything, once again 😔
Bruce 🤣
I would smash Agent Hill so hard. Cap and Thor missing out.
Tony is worthy. He risked his life multiple times for the greater good. Tony Stark has made a lot of mistakes but he&#39;s always trying to do this right thing. Even giving his life to do so. He maybe an arrogant prick but I think he&#39;s worthy. He&#39;s just a guy trying to do the right thing.
Well,what happened to the audio.
Other than the fact the hammer moved a little, you could tell that Cap wasn’t trying at all.  He didn’t wanna embarrass Thor.  What a good man.
Banner at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=65">1:05</a> lmfao 😆😆😆
Thor was like yo dumbass better not lift that shit
Waah modiji waah
Back when MCU was good.. not bloated like it is now.
Remember guys, Kevin said the new Captain Marvel movie is going to be as good as an Avenger movie.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s been delayed over 9 months!
Captain America knew he could lift it but didn&#39;t as an act of humility to Thor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a>
It&#39;s hilarious how everyone responded when stark stood up🤣
bruh thor was trying to be funny and picked it up with ease that so sad cap could of pick it up with but he did not want to  make thor feel bad
131 million views for this 2 minutes scene 🥶🥶
Mjölnir in mythology can be lifted by anyone, but Thor will beat you like a redheaded Loki if you do.  He beat the shit out of Loki for messing with Sif&#39;s hair.
The best gimmick after all
Captain America almost done but
Cap is a true meaningful friend to Thor.He knows he can lift the hammer but didn&#39;t do that to tease Thor  in front of other friends.That is a true friendship.
i hate the frame rate or whatever they did to make the camera movement look weird anyone else
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=78">1:18</a>  what a smile
[[[@@
😊☺☺😀☺☺
I thought someone other than Thor was able to lift it
Thor understood that there is no middle ground. The Hammer either moves or it Doesn&#39;t. So Cap moving it even a millimeter made Thor realize, as he says<br> &quot;I knew it&quot;
The fact that Captain America didn&#39;t lift it despite being able to, to not embrass thor is one reason he is also worthy
If even hulk can’t even slightly move it how does the table hold it
Imagine thor accidently drop his hammer on the ground while the filp 😂😂😂
The real thor is coming
XD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mrs3628">https://www.youtube.com/@mrs3628</a>
I think he realized he could lift it on first try and then on the second try he decided to not give it its all and kinda gave up for his friend ego not to be ruin.
Theres these superheroes and then Robin Scherbatsky/Robin Sparkles lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a>
Everything about him didn’t come out of a bottle.
where’s the rest or is that it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> I knew it:  Thor
I like how avengers endgame is the reason for older clips getting more views
Rogers wasnt worthy because he knew the WS killed Starks parents and kept it a secret.

Thor already know that cap was worthy and cap not show off and remain humble....
Everybody need friend like Steve
WHY THEY CUT HIS HAIR WHYYYYY
60 fps is distracting trash.
It&#39;s beautiful that if humans are compassionate enough, they can be worthy of Divine Weapons.
Even though this wasnt the greatest Avenger movie this is one of my favorite scenes.  Them all just sitting around messing around with Thor&#39;s hammer.  Feels like such a real situation.  Like a bunch of friends sitting around shooting the shit.
Idk how I feel about 60fps Movies, they look like video game cutscenes
It budged
In my head its clint on those drums
This scene is thousand times better than all the phase 4 stuff combined
cap has always been worthy even since the first avenger
Always knew captain stopped himself shows the respect &amp; love for his team
The first time we knew Cap was always worthy....even in training when the grenade was thrown on the ground.....He was willing to jump on it for his comrades.  That&#39;s Cap&#39;s real super power is courage and never-ending selflessness.

I miss the Avengers, I hope we get a new team soon, maybe the WC Avengers.
Thor: I knew it
Cap lets it go as soon as it moves a little, and then he pretends to try to lift it. He has such a good heart that he didn&#39;t want to make his friend feel bad.
Age of Ultron aged very well for me.<br>Not a GREAT movie like the first Avengers, but many great moments. Cap fighting Ultron on the van, the personal interaction between the avengers, Hulk vs Hulkbuster, Vision being created, Vision lifting Mjolnir,...<br><br>And James Spader is always a win.
Thor&#39;s face it priceless
I have A Simpler one your all not Worthy
I like how Tony got his gauntlet and even got Rhody. Man does not give up. 3 tries, and got his backup and his other backup/ best friend
&quot;Nobody can lift it. Not even Jackson. And he does CrossFit.&quot;
MCU needs a show about the worthy coatrack that can hold the hammer. CLOTHES ASSEMBLE!
All the avengers trying to lift it <br>The Table :🗿
Thor is happy to see all this bcoz Vision is not there
The only thing that stops people from lifting Mjolnir is that it is very very heavy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> Thor&#39;s Expressions!
If you pay really close attention when cap starts picking it up, during the cut to Thor, Mjolnir moves ever so slightly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=43">0:43</a> nope-
After the events of Endgame, I wonder how many of them are worthy now, especially Tony and Hulk (if Tony had survived, of course)<br>Also, I just noticed and love the little detail that Cap notices that the hammer is weightles to him, instantly loosens his grip, almost sending his whole body flying away from the hammer in the process and also accidentally making it budge just a little, puts a grip back in the hammer and then adjusts his grip so he can pretend to try to lift the hammer
GOW Thor &gt; MCU
If captain America really represented America in stereotypes his name would basically be guns swords and stuff
The way Steve rolls his sleeves up as of to say, I’m the man for the job😂
Thank you so much❤🤣
Jimmy shergill should be next Captain America
Lmao all the people here saying &quot;Cap didnt want to hurt Thor&#39;s feelings&quot; are the typical &quot;fan&quot; that only watched Endgame and not the whole timeline. For your information, at this timeline Cap hadnt admitted yet to Tony that bucky killed his parents and kept it as a secret. The Mjolnir knows if someone hides a secret and for that you wont be worthy to lift it. When Cap finally admitted to Tony about that, that was the time He became worthy.
There are a lot of comments saying that Steve could (and to be fair he does look like he deliberately didn&#39;t lift it) but part of me has another theory.<br>He was very close to be able to which is why it moved slightly but the guilt over keeping the details of the death of Tony&#39;s parents from him may have been holding him back from being fully worthy. In Civil War we see the fallout from that decision, the pain it causes and the regret he has. By Infinity War he has moved past it, not seeking redemption but understanding and then finally by Endgame when he reconciles and stands by Tony one last time he can then lift Mjölnir.<br><br>Obviously when Age of Ultron was written the plot line for Civil War was likely not even in planning stages but I like to think they left the door open for that little bit of character development for Cap.
Am i the only one who feels like Natasha made a sexual reference when they ask to see if she can &quot;lift the hammer&quot; and she replies &quot;that&#39;s not a question i need answered&quot; 😂
The look on Thor&#39;s face is priceless especially after watching Thor love and Thunder then watching Avengers Endgame and Age of the Ultron Thors Hammer is his world but When Thor gets the Axe it&#39;s a different conversation like finding there have been only 3 choose ones Captain America Thor and Vision
Hammer is weighed 300 billion elephants<br>How can that building handle that weight<br>Stark tower 😂😂
“Clint, you’ve had a tough week with you know, snow plowers and stuff we won’t hold it against you if you can’t get it up” <br><br><br><br><br>Too soon? Yea probably too soon…he is recovering and in good health tho
The table can lift the hammer. Couldn&#39;t you guys see it hahaha
If it was made out of neuron star material it would’ve hurdled into the center of the planet eons ago but it’s not it’s “forged IN the heart of a dying star” it is not “forged OF the heart of a dying star”
I noticed Steve almost had it
I’m dying 😂😂😂
Meanwhile Cap got his original hammer in endgame... 😲😲😲
Try lifting the table, not the hammer.  It&#39;s fiction, but maybe there&#39;s a workaround.
movie scenes in 60 fps just don&#39;t feel right
ok my question is back then cap didn&#39;t know he is worthy right? So he supposed to lift it right away even hit his butt on the ground by his unexpected strength. but he chose to fake it so he knew it before the lift?
I just googled what prima nocta is 😂
I remember this scene when I went to the theater and everyone gasp when it slipped for cap
love how he says &quot;yea of course&quot; loll hilarious @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=41">0:41</a>
Thor’s hammer was like<br>“Not yet Steve, not just yet.”
Wait wtf....omg it did MOVE A TINY BIT, I SWEAR I SEEN THIS SEVERAL TIMES
Tony knows better than to have his suit buttoned while sitting down.  Always struck me as odd that he would unbutton when standing up.
Love seeing the Avengers chilling together
Who else had to look up what prima nocta was and was surprised it stayed lol
Thor was surprised captain america almost lift the hammer without the remote control he has in his wristband 😂
worthy is something you can grow into. Capt wasn&#39;t worthy then , but is later.
One little detail I noticed now when Steve attempts to lift the hammer. <br><br>It looks like he felt the hammer being lifted from the table and then you can see his grip loosen to drop it. Then after you can see him pretending to put force into the lift. <br><br>Just goes to show he knew he could lift it all this time until Endgame, while also refusing to humiliate his friend Thor. Best buds! <br><br>Also, Tony and Rhodey. Best friends always, especially in moments like this.
honestly, I wish Steve lifted it just so i could see how everyone would react. It woulda ruined any of the future scenes but still wish it happed just to see
I know Steve&#39;s humble and all but you gotta say he must&#39;ve felt so much pride when he knew he could lift it.
This is what makes marvel special! Little scenes like this just make us feel more human.
Thors reaction says it all…
This scene is golden. Thor&#39;s expression when he sees the hammer nudge and Captain America&#39;s grace in not picking it up even if he could (right?). Tells you that Cap is definitely noble hearted.
“I will be reinstituting prima nocta”<br><br>Jesus Christ, Tony, of all things lmao
&quot;We won&#39;t hold it against you if you can&#39;t get it up.&quot;  Haha
&quot;whoever holds Jonathan will harness the power of thor&quot;
Everyone else, nah man its a trick , its some sort of magic i cant do that! Iron man: so, if i lift it i get to rule asgard?
That little bit of foreshadowing was all I needed
So none of them are worthy? They’re all heroes
That look of uncertainty is priceless especially come endgame!
Love how Steve knew he could lift it but decided not to to not make Thor look bad.
Groot was able to pick up the hammer in adventure end game
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=84">1:24</a> thors face 😅
Mjolnir likes Captain America! Captain America is fueled by the power of LOVE to fight the hideousness of Nordic &quot;pride&quot; which is the same evil as pride anywhere!
Natash was also worthy, she sacrificed herself.<br>wow marvel.
the table is worthy
i feel like tony is definitely worthy now…
That smile when Thor realizes Steve isn’t going to pick it up. Like he said in Endgame, he knew it, and he knows it here when he sees the wiggle. Steve didn’t embarrass him in front of everybody. A true friend, and a worthy one.
Tony: This is physics.<br>Also Tony: Takes only a glove of his Iron Man suit instead of fully put it on, thus drastically increase the amount of brutal force available to him. Even though, we all know it wouldn&#39;t help.
Man, I know the hammer is for worthy people but seriously. How is a lab experiment wannabe becoming a god.
The real strong one in this vid is the table, not only holding up all the other weight, but also holding mjolnir without giving out.
For those of you wondering Starr&#39;s comment of &#39;...reinstituted Prima Nacta...&quot; is where you agree that the King gets to sleep with your wife.
Imagine if Thor did the same thing with stormbreaker
I always thought that, could they lift the table which mjolnir is on? They made a joke about it whether the elevator is worthy :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=59">0:59</a>
thor got scared for a sec because of cap, lifted it. A little. Thor was like: &quot;Oh shit.&quot; In his mind btw.
If Stan Lee was still there he would have easily lifted it
Captain America didn’t want to hurt Thor’s feelings lmao <br>A true and worthy Chad
WE WERE FOUND FAMILY TROPE BAITED AND IM MAD ABOUT IT
Tony&#39;s clothing is the exact clothes that I will definitely use to all of formal meetings.
I like this thor instead our comedy thor
I JUST got that &quot;can&#39;t get it up&quot; joke.
Thor knew Cap was worthy until in Endgame he was right🤣
I read one of the most retarded things today: According to some Reddit Einstein, Cap was only able to nudge Mjolnir because apparently MCU vibranium is magical 😂😂 And some magic has rubbed off on him over the years through his shield, enabling him to move the hammer slightly 💀💀 <br>1. Even if Vibranium is somewhat enchant-able, we’ve never seen even a pube hair of evidence on film. <br>2. That still wouldn’t mean that’s the reason Steve can lift Mjolnir. It’s called “He’s Worthy.” Plain and simple.
Thor probably went to sleep that night wondering if he just imagined Cap nudging the hammer, but in his heart of hearts, he knew Steve was among those who could lift it. There&#39;s no &quot;almost worthy&quot;, you either can or cannot lift it.
When u realise the table he put the hammer on is stronger than the avengers
O único digno do martelo é Stark , capitã é um idiota .
Cap knew he could lift it but choose not too for the sake of Thor and the team what a guy!
Imagine if Stan lee walked into this room at the end of the movie and picked it up
the groaning when thor said they were all not worthy 😂
호크아이 슨배임은 나가있어
Sadly dont thing we will ever get great scenes like these from Marvel anymore
Imagine if deadpool walked in lifted the hammer and said &quot;nice paperweight&quot;
Tony and Nat can lift it up now.
Mjolnir was forged in the core of a dieing Star!<br>These cores are the most compacted, densiest and highest-mass in the universe...<br>Only one tea spoon of this do have the same mass and weight as the Mount Everest...😱🤯❕️❕️❕️<br>...and now count this up to Mjolnir&#39;s volume and you will understand why NOBODY can lift this hammer...at all
I hate when people add motion smoothing to these movies.  HD is fine but the weird soap opera effect is awful.
It would have been even funnier if, after this scene, Thor, swearing to everyone that he saw Cap lift the hammer, went on a quest to try and prove it by finding clever ways of tricking Cap into lifting the hammer only for Cap to see through them. It would also have made the scene from Engame when Cap reveals that he CAN indeed lift the hammer all the better.
Commented this  4 years ago but now I want to expand. Cap was always worthy. It&#39;s possible he knew this and was pretending he couldn&#39;t lift it past the small wiggle as to now show off and spare Thor&#39;s feelings :3
2022 like in
Who is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=75">1:15</a>?
Clint: struggling <br>Tony: struggling <br>James: struggling <br>Bruce: struggling <br>Natasha: doesn’t even want to try<br>Steve: struggling <br><br>The table: hehe boi
Tony putting on his Iron Man hand armor was totally pointless, until he tries to have his tiny thrusters in the glove help him, he&#39;s still trying to lift the hammer with just human muscle, shoulders, back and legs, what was the point of putting on an iron glove, if anything it probably gave him less friction to grab the hammer with, metal on metal. 🤦

Cobie Smulders is stunning. That&#39;s all I have to say.
i remember pre-endgame, people saw the scene and thought &quot;oh, a reference to the comics! so, cap&#39;s like only a little bit worthy?&quot; and people made all these theories on if cap is truly worthy or only a little bit and then endgame basically just said &quot;nah, he&#39;s been worthy from the start&quot;
I know this movies are about action and all but I really liked to see this guys just hanging out like friends, I wish we had seen more of that
Damn! Today I just heard in this scene that Tony will reinstate Prima Nocta upon lifting the hammer. LOL
💕💕❤❤💘💘
We need a Special Presentation for the OG Avengers, an alternate universe maybe where they just hang out, everyone is alive, and Bruce and Nat actually become a couple 😂
Best part of the whole movie
I&#39;m curious if superman could lift the hammer? Although he is from DC.
The way that thors face changed when the hammer moved like a inch 🫢 what he is think dont try me mother f_<i>__</i> 🖕🖕🖕🖕
This is a lil bittersweet in hindsight when this scene is one of the only ones we get of the avengers just relaxing and having fun like a normal group of friends
I like Sony Thor better
Thor in another level 😂
ai busses wont come for another 5 years and subways wont come for another 2 years.
Captain America is supposed to be able to lift the hammer
Cap didn’t want to embarrass his friend
I know the Avengers don&#39;t tell each other things they should<br>But Thor should say his hammer 🔨 is enchanted here as well as it being able to work on someone who is worthy
Bro the table is that one table worthy does that table rule asguard
the table is worthy
Just REPRESENT
Prema nocta is crazy
The table is worthy XD
to those who are internally <br>worthy : <br>a kind but firm , just leader, who is unselfish, truly confident, &amp; has depth of heart/unshallow, Mljoner weighs 43.5 pounds. <br><br>those whose character lacks these traits,  are deemed unworthy &amp; the all fathers power makes it 43million pounds. <br>un-liftable.
Vision was worthy
The look on Joker&#39;s face when Batman spilled some drinks on Aquaman&#39;s underwater carpet.
Captain America was born worthy
jesus this looks like dog shit at the higher fps
In this part i wz like &quot;oo 🧐
Stark budged the handle when he wrapped the strap on his wrist. 39 secondish.
I think Superman can
Also who would have ever thought that 4 years later that Steve would wind up being worthy after all?
I’m pretty sure Natasha would have easily picked it up. I mean Clint couldn’t do it at all
<b>Where is fucking Hela ?</b> 🤷
จำดวงดาวที่ไปติดก้องได้กันไหมครับ..นั่นระที่ผมจะเอาเข้ามา
Thor best
This scene really paid off down the line.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=38">0:38</a> он его сдвинул!
Before endgame was released I honestly thought that Captain America couldn’t lift it because he was harbouring dark thoughts and was deemed not worthy [because this was right before civil war]
The reason Cap wasn&#39;t worthy is because He knew who killed my parents Tony and didn&#39;t tell him
Thor’s expression change when Cap almost lifts it. Cap could definitely already lift it, but chose not to.
Fucking classic jahah
I wonder if it&#39;s heavy in real life. .?
This movie was Thor’s best characterization next to Thor 1 and Infinity War
I just realized something the tables worthy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=45">0:45</a> 💀 Everytime I’ve ever watched this scene before Tony’s always said “I will be fair but firmly cruel” and now it’s a rape joke? Why would anyone edit this
Steve in his thoughts after pretending not able to pick thors hammer  when Thor says you all are not worthy<br>Captain America - On your left 🤣
fun fact: When Steve moved the hammer slightly, Thor seemed to be quite scared, thinking he was worthy. And in endgame, Thor says ‘I knew it.’ to Cap, when he picked up the hammer.
Having them try to act like normal people hanging out sounds so cringey
Thor be like:ohh shitt..no no u cant take my hammer
So the hook he leaves it on is worthy?
Bruce yelling at everyone is what makes it
THE TABLE IS WORTHY TO BE THE KING OF ASGARD!!!!
I wonder if the moment Tony snapped in Endgame, was he worthy then?
Captain lifted the edge by 1 cm (Correct me if im wrong)
every movie Tony sacrificed his life more than anyone else and cap was somehow the one worthy enough to weild mjolnir??
I did not know what Prima Nocta was before this scene.<br><br>Apparently it was a law that allowed a nobleman the right to bed any female subject of his on the night of her wedding (to another man) if he so desired.<br><br>Interesting, Stark...
Does nobody else see the sleeping girl reflected in the glass? Who’s that?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE 60FPS?!!
Stark puts on his Iron Man gauntlet to lift, but lifting also includes your arm, shoulder, back legs &amp; feet. Imagine if he tried to lift a car with just a gauntlet on, wouldn’t happen same logic should apply here, but yeah he’s not worthy either so it’s whatever.
The look on Thor’s face when he almost saw Captain America lift it! 😂😂😂
Thors face when Captain America Almost picked it up💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=83">1:23</a> you can see the hammer slightly move and the look on Thor’s face is hilarious! 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=65">1:05</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=72">1:12</a> wow, Banner...
2 great acting moments in this scene. 1: The way Robert Downey Jr unbuttons his suit jacket with such style &amp; grace and of course 2: Hemsworth facial reactions
Mr. Rogers would&#39;ve been able to lift it.
The fact that people are still arguing over whether or not cap could lift it or not in this scene proves how great the writing for the scene is
I  lift mjölnir
In the end of movie*<br>Tony : kya hoga agar hum hammer ko lift me rakh de<br>Cap : lift to upar jayegi<br>Tony : pr lift to worthy hi nhi h<br>😂😂😂
Thor : You&#39;re all not worthy <br>Cap : (smiles) 💀💀💀
Thor a few years  later: Ah ah I knew it
Ah Ah I know it
😊☺😀☺☺
😅😇😅😇😅😇
whats the prob with hawkeye..i mean whats his issues why cant lift the hammer. I know a thing or two bout blackwidow but clint...?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a>
😇😅😇😅😇
ruruwueuru
😊☺😀☺😀
&quot;here, take the little one&quot;
Captain America really can lift the Hammer
Either he didn&#39;t lift it on purpose or he and mjolnir understood one another in that moment and mjolnir didn&#39;t allow itself to be lifted for the sake of Thor.
Only Thor, Cap, and the Elevator are worthy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=81">1:21</a> that was the moment he knew, that he had to get a new one.
😑😕😑😕
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3bhQwY0KCY&amp;t=80">1:20</a> that was one of the best moment of MCU. When I first watched it I knew at some point Cap will lift it &amp; just imagining that I got goosebumps &amp; seeing him lifting the hammer that moment gives me goosebumps 1000x
Pick up the table. Problem solved. You can thank me later.
It&#39;s a foreshadow on this scene even Thor new Capt could lift it, however Capt pretended not to so he can&#39;t hurt Thor&#39;s ego.
The camaraderie in this scene would have been sooo much better with Captain Marvel there to tell them that she didn&#39;t need a hammer to be more worthy than any of them.
Lol cap deciding not to embarrass thor in front of everyone is why he is worthy
😑😕😑😑
Tony saying that he will reinstitute “prima nocta” is basically how Lords or Kings can sleep with any maid and woman, regardless of class
😆😅😇😅
This is not pick up hamer realty is Thor glous
rruueeu
2223😅😇😅😆😊☺😀😀☺😀rkkerik
rurriirrur
The interpolation scared me more than that nudge scared Thor
I’m almost certain this is the only interaction between Clint and Thor before “Endgame”
in the beginning only the worthy could do it. and now who cant?
What a sausage fest.
Kind of annoying this is the Only non copyright clip of this. Some edits would be cool
i love tha fact that the mjolnir is kept on a normal glass table and still the table is not broken
The Black Widow knows her limitations.
The fact it barely even moved and Thor still got worried had me rolling 😂
Cap could lift the hammer here but chose not to so as not to embarrass Thor. If he couldn&#39;t do it here, he wouldn&#39;t bother trying in the heat of battle with Thanos
Good lord cap is just too damn worthy
