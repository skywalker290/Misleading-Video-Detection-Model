Knew this was coming- precise, repeatable camera motion, faster than humans can do, or so slow and smooth as to be almost imperceptible. A spatial reference that humans can key the action to. Elaborate motions can be &quot;handed off&quot; from one robot to another, either with clever fixturing or CGI blending (the former preferred). Featherweight cameras will allow less-expensive motion systems accessible to smaller budgets. The sound of the motors may be a problem for some shots, but clever sound design should be able to cope with it.
Is this csgo hacker 😂😂😂
Gotta love KUKA robots!
Drones can do the same cant it?
How can I rent this
The clip shown at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=84">1:24</a> of this video is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=116">1:56</a> in Kendrick Lamar&#39;s music video &quot;HUMBLE.&quot;
Waiting for AI to move it.
I’m not so crazy about those shots and I also saw people doing the same shit with an iPhone (almost cmon)
how much does it cost?
Yea, but are you getting one.
I hate technology like this, not gonna lie. In 1970s, movies portraeited what the camema man saw, as the eyes of the scene. Camera tech like his ijust like CGI, and takes only out from the atmosphere of a scene.
And industrial robot of this size is going to run about $100K when all is said and done and probably similar money for the base robot.  The end effectors to attach the camera and working out the cabling and how to mount it.  I&#39;d say their cable management could be improved to limit the swinging around of a cable loop -- that could hit something but it will also increase the risk of cable failure over time and noise.  They have to mic the robot to cancel out the sound of the servo motors I think -- if so I wonder how many mics are used.
Seems little dangerous 😮
I&#39;ve watched this 3 times already
Liked
we need a mini version<br>call it hayato
wow
This can also be done with a programmable drone
Woww
I love that song I think it from moe shop
Came here to watch that dope intro again! Wow 🔥
Messi the goat
I need something like this adorable
What part of Oregon ?? I need. Visit this place
damn, i didn’t realize how different marques used to look. i remember this video coming out but i swear it was only a year or two ago
thats pretty dope man
The people in these comment sections are thinking it’s like 2017 😂
Just 2 good
good video marcus. send me your details
Kamal Hassan used this robotic camera in Vikram movie&#39;s couple of action scenes
DERP FACE strikes again 🤡
Very nice
It&#39;s funny how this giant and technological robot is controlled by a Xbox controller.
being a musician that aspires to be completely fully independent, I look forward to the day I am able to buy this both budget wise and logistics wise, I couldn&#39;t find any website that was selling a proper professional &quot;robot camera&quot; so even if I had the money, it looks like it isn&#39;t in the market just yet.
I’m waiting for the knockoffs on Amazon for $1000 to come out lol
In love with this ever since I saw that shot in &quot;Humble&quot; and then watched your video couple months later.
Movements &#39;a human could never do with any tools that exist now&#39; hey? CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! Ha ha. I want to try some similar moves on a Bollywood music video I&#39;ve got coming up.
Reminds me of Mark Roberts or General Lift servo moco setups. Nice gear!<br>Motion control has been an amazing tool since the 70s, the game remote is a nice addition.
HOW DOES HE HAVE MY EXCACT BACKGROUND <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=4">0:04</a>
there’s someone out there who bought this and only uses it for their instagram
Its look like a glambot
I am kira
@felixba wann bekommt ihr so einen ins neue Studio?
Wonder if this could be used for wildlife filming? Especially for the jungles of India. Tiger filming could get a new impetus. What do you think?
gg. gonna watch this video on 2025 and compare the old one with new robots you own later (2025)
Vikram Tamil movie used same robot camera technology - they used mocobot company product
To make me food
There is a recent Indian Tamil language blockbuster movie called Vikram that used a Mocobot for its kickass interval action sequence, it looks dope!
This tech is used in vikram movie interval
Vikram
Camera need to program two hours for 10 seconds shot
BIA-London ft J.Cole his part uses a robot like this
Coming after watching Vikram (2022) movie. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Who is here after watching Vikram 🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=320">5:20</a>
This camera from Bolt has been used in the tamil movie Vikram 2022 which released recently on June 3rd.
this is used in Vikram movie..🎉
Vikram interval scene 🔥
How all are see vikram movie 🍿🎥<br>Comment
After after vikram interval block scene ?
Vikram ⚡
now i want to know what programming language they used. i m learing coding. can anyone what language they used.
They make it so hard to find the prices of stuff like that!
Bheeshma pravam team use this camera
wow so cool
I like how it’s not remote controlled. 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Which song is that
Who else thought it would be perfect for the trend that&#39;s going on ig rn. Lol
Awesome!
what is the price of the vigo for example?
Will probably fit in the studio (wink wink) xD
:&gt;
I know how much my Edelkrone setup cost, and how no-so-precise it is compared to Terminator here, so how much is Kira?
Best Clip! Kendrick Lamar Humble
What kind of safety was in place for this? Seems pretty dangerous unless it had DCS zones made for the area you would be standing in with a DCS safety mat to know your position.
Wow you got a cut👍🙂🙂🙂
Comme bien le pris
I think this will be my new vloging camera…

Kira
Hi guys
For me this is the best mkbhd video thanks for that great discovery
Nice, but starts at $70k USD
DOPE ASS tech!! Brilliant execution
I can see the choreography fails now, lots of head smacks
Why cant i buy it
GLaDOS
I dare not to ask bout the price...
Amazing tech. But the shots got old real fast.
hi
Kira is actually responsible for many deaths...
very cool
Mia and Kira! Both characters in my story!
Really awesome!
for marketing agencies , specially for digital marketing this would be useful for shooting ads that are on next level . This might cost 100K $ + but truly impressive
The closest I&#39;ve ever come to what I see here is filming with a drone, which by the way can also be controlled with a console controller as seen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=140">2:20</a>
Wow I like 👍👍
nice the tony stark robot arm is now real, what was he called?? the one holding the fire extinguisher all the time
Monthly electricity bill?? Just wondering.
DOJA CAT&#39;S MUSIC VIDEO
This is cool...😃👍
This seems like a DOPE TECH
Hey. I&#39;m from the future. You own the MIA now
I wonder if that up and down can be inverted. That would be confusing for me if it couldn&#39;t since that&#39;s how I game.
These shots are great in moderation. If they are overused it really becomes something that would be kinda annoying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=84">1:24</a> i watched this song but i don&#39;t remember it&#39;s name please anyone tell me
Camera man job lost?
Even if this robotic arm revolts and wants to kill me, I still want it!
Imagine if the robot started attacking the object in focus
Coming soon to MKBHD studio near you
Garuda Linux Wallpaper😂
superb
Where I can purchase this item please let me know
Standard Industrial robot with a bit of software making it easier to operate. What could go wrong?<br>We have a smaller robot at the university that has a cage and it only moves if the cage is closed and no one is in there. Because it literally can kill you due to the insane acceleration it&#39;s capable of.
We can see one on making off from the clip &quot; best friends - Toy Box &quot; in 1999 ;) nothing is new...they use 3D world simulation with green screen on move camera on a Robot...not speed like that, and more big..but same concept :)
It&#39;s really amazing 🤩
this is the most CGI look of unCGI video I&#39;ve ever seen
Took 3 years for Slomo Guys to finally do a video with one today
It feels like putting your go pro on factory arm
Nice one bro you ready did a wonderful job

I Love this video so much.
When you launch your music video
Can I use it to serve tea
that&#39;s really cool, You need a bigger studio ;)
🤩😩😩
this was used in the Body Remix - Tion Wayne, Russ ft. Arrdee, ... music video
wtf kira and mia are characters form death note movie
Tony stark’s Dummy robot in real life
Price?
Price?
So I came back to watch this video again only to discover Marques being super happy during the whole shoot. I mean did you guys see that smile when he said, Peace?
Could&#39;ve been called Misa instead of Mia lmao great tech
Passive income idea - Mount a RED Komodo on this, mount the whole system on a Tesla, send it around the world to shoot while you&#39;re sipping tea on the couch at the comfort of your home, Upload to footage to a stock site... You&#39;re welcome.
Always remember to repent of your sins (sin is transgression of YAHUAH’S LAW: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, &amp; Deuteronomy) And Have Belief On YAHUSHA HAMASHYACH. HE Died and Rose three days later so that you can be forgiven of your sins! <br><br>HE Loves you! Come to HIM!🙂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=185">3:05</a> I want that mini robot model

He is getting this isnt he!!!
Kendrick Lamar had used this in his humble music video
i bet it&#39;s super expensive
we have one we call it &quot;Knock out arm&quot; you have to be 100% there hahaha
A lot of this could be done with speed ramping and reversing the playback from the focal point, but this would save production time significantly for those shots.
I watched this because of ONF&#39;s &quot;Ugly Dance&quot; music video and they said they filmed it 99% with a camera robot.
This is AWESOME!!!
KIRA😈
those where some sloppy keyframes though.<br>especially with the laptop.
Please give me one I phone
your video quality is dope like i can also watch it on hd altough its on 240p
It&#39;s been three years (🤯!!!) since this video has been uploaded! It is still my most memorable and never ageing video from your channel, Marques! Top quality tech and top quality video! Evergreen stuff! Keep up your good work, man <br>🙏
I found kira, I’m calling the police
this robot was used for the oneplus 8t video intro
Doja cat ima bit ima boss
Sweet
Makes me wonder if it&#39;s possible to program a drone to do this.
This is pretty amazing really. When they start to make use of AI to compensate for any unintended changes in an actor&#39;s movement, it will be a total game changer.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=67">1:07</a> where the fuck you see the camera slider. Those are just rails. Please Marques research before it makes you look stupid.
this Mac Book shot was so sick
That twist is super awesome
The tall language empirically spark because dew ostensibly turn afore a fat faulty friction. befitting, diligent france
Does somebody remember a shortfilm that they use this robot don&#39;t know if its the same but they made amazing shots. The short film was about this guy who was addicted to social media or like more likely to his phone till the point that he starts to get crazy and he sees his phone in his hand and somehow its integrated in his palm haha and so on. I remember watching it but can recall the name I tried to look it up. Maybe somebody has seen it? Cheers
HA HAAAA,   I had to say it,  yes,    the porn shots you could get with the Kira is crazy but also l think they had the camera on some kind of cable system for formula 1 racing,   you could shoot crazy shots in basketball,  soccer,  pro frisbee,  baseball,  football,  golf,  the list is unending,  it&#39;s up to your imagination how and where you could use this thing....    l love it<br><br>6apr2021,dellthecomputer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=153">2:33</a> can some1 tell me where to order the gears
ill stick to the old arm thank you
What is a supercomputer? Who programs the supercomputer? Based on the fact that a supercomputer is programmed?!
This was the best scene in the 10mil vid 😭
The round shot was also used by one plus nord ad
Kuka KR6 and KR8, it looks like Kuka is now everywhere in media/stage.

Anyone else notice the VIA Films logo on that RED? 😎
I want something like this but for a table top and I can just attach my smartphone or A7III on. Product photography would be AMAZING :)
Peace .. Shalom .. Salam .. Namaste and Thank You so much Marques for All that you are doing to Heal our Mother Earth   🙏🏻 😊 🌈 ✌ 🌷 ❤
I wonder if people have been smacked by these by mistake? LoL
Yoooo
Oh no, i have watched TOO MUCH robot videos
Duuuude!
My budget is around 100 euros, what can i get for that money?
where to by Kira?
Metric!
Use DJI RS 2 it will provide  you all this requirements with very less price
ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MIA JOKE AT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=402">6:42</a>???
I’m building a table top robotic arm, are the people at Motorized Percision open sourcing that software?
man thats just like a render....but real. the movement is sweet.
Cool but you can be very easy hit by that arm if you are in his way :)
The is no I’m gonna buy this so what’s the point of watching
this thing should have a rack mount in front of the camera to put anything in the center of the screen in foreground. like mount a phone and watch thru it for an ads for phones.
The lewd parentheses reilly travel because garlic resultspreviously load among a agreeable mouth. homely, grouchy machine
I do really admire Marques now. His ideas, his passion and his creativity really inspire me to do things. Now, I believe in a saying that “if he can do things, I can do too”. Very thankful that I discover this Channel

OMG Jarvis is real 😂<br>But just imagine getting hit by the camera right in the face 😂
I just came across a studio/rental house (ENIGMA 3) in Utah that has both these robots. I sense that someday down the line I&#39;ll be filming with this... 😏
it&#39;s fun and all until they make a robot named GLaDOS
Пиздеж сначала и до конца видео)
kira is death in japeneas
The focus problem could be totally resolved with a lidar range finder with pinpoint accuracy.  Also using robot vision for part of the control feedback would help.   You can mount two small camera&#39;s dedicated to the robot vision and change their angles as needed for the different camera/shot needs.
damn this really cool man
Multi-cam shot better...
imagine this robots gets an error and smashes you in the face with the camera. yikes!

plz upload ur intro animation turorial video
Dope indeed! Always wondered how those slow-motion orbit shots of people jumping etc were done - I guess something like this was probably involved.

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=325">5:25</a> Are the cables in the left Upper corner visible 😂🙏🏻but great work tho
Niceeeeeeee
I just realized that all the robot arms used for filming are painted in black when they are normally sold with jazzy colours. I guess that the reason is to have little effect on the reflected light in the recorded scene.
What is the price of kira
The amused voice histologically mix because silk modestly seal down a fluffy court. calm, awesome perch
Best intro ever
This is absolutely dope
are the movements completely repeatable and accurate?<br>also, can  you record the movements?
You just blew my mind. Love the movements.
Imagine the adult film that could be shot with this!
SICK!!!
Uuumanchas so noice
The intro is dope:)
OMG buy one. And let me come play with it. Kthx
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=229">3:49</a> him in the background tho

Linus Media Group Camera ops: “.... fuck”
I would like to see that in your studio.<br><br>                    Wink wink
Going to need a bigger studio.
&quot;You can move the robot through space and time&quot; - That IS dope tech!
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. GOD sent his son to die for you and your sin and rose again so that you may have life in him who loved us everlasting life in heaven with him GOD loves you very much and no sin too big for GOD. if you want to get saved pray this prayer Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.
ಅದ್ಭುತವಾದ ಸುಂದರವಾದ ವಿಡಿಯೋ ❤️😍 amazing and beautiful video ❤️ 😍 nice video ❤️😍
damn bro i literally saw the same intro a million times!
I&#39;d use the robot to feed me food and whenever my dog come it will move the food away I&#39;d just have to add cameras to the robot itself
&quot;Kira&quot;<br>Anime fans: monkaS
maybe for porn...?
I see this being used in ads
I’ll take 2.
That intro was smooth as hell
Space and time?
Imagine how crazy this would be, to show a man who never have seen technic before.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=11">0:11</a> this type of shot was used in a Bollywood song &quot;Garmi&quot;.
Doesn’t apple use this a lot?
Can reach places humans can’t , like in Porno Lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=210">3:30</a> MKBHD and the CEO look like siblings lmao
Very basic introduction to vision based projects in manufacturing. <br>Industrialist are doing the same with UR, kuka, hyundai, tata robots to captured multiangle product images for automated tests.
Working in industry with robotic arms, there are lots and lots of safety measures, Like you cant really be in the same area as a robot unless you turn it off for maintenance or have yout hand constantly on a button. This just makes me rethink
Killer Queen has already touched that robot
“Instead of through my head”, understated health concern.
That’s like the iron man robots in the first three movies
Damn google pixel got its best shot advert ever.
This Intro had my hype my man.  <br>Damn I love your energy. Bring it back! 🏆🥇
This is the dopest mkbhd video in the history of youtube
That robot is the god of the new world.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=494">8:14</a> remind me wall-e
I bet that thing could could really put a hurting on you if you got in its way..oof
Maybe you should have mentioned the cost of the robo-arm?
bro just keep doing what yo doing
The intro to this was soooooo smooth
Replay mod real life
RED IS SCAM
The new generation calls MKBHD an inspiration... Inspiration for what? Easy money? Being a youtuber or blogger, vlogger or similar type of s**t, is not a job. Lazy people who do it call it a &quot;job&quot; but it is only a hobby, in my opinion. Having a youtube chanel for years and being a freeloader given all this expensive stuff for free that you and I have to pay thousands of dollars to buy, is not something to be proud of. I work 14-hours/day in my job. Now that is a real job, not what MKBHD or the Kardashians et al are doing. The moment Social Media collapses these people do not have the tools to find a real job.
His hart is probably pounding bcus the camera can hit him
I live in Portland OR
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=440">7:20</a> the way he holds a controller you can just tell he has never played console in the past
I THINK U HAVE MUCH MORE MONEY PLS GIVE ME 1 LAPTOP I HAVE  NO BUDGET TO BUY LAPTOP PLS!!
Wish I could set up one of those in my RV.
I hate to even think what that costs...
But do production companies find this useful?
Fun Fact: Dude Perfect actually uses these cameras
Love your vids. Also have a youtube channel
Greatest intro of all time
ഇത് തന്നെ ട്രാൻസിലും use ചെയ്തേ 🤣
be humble
I can totally picture a next generation where KIRA&#39;s arm doesn&#39;t move as fast and it&#39;s more smooth, so that this can work beautifully for movies and TV shows.
Queria te 2
You explained it better than most other videos
Imagine this camera going out of control 😬😲😳
Do you have an Amazon affiliate link for this?
so basically replay mod in real life -_-
😂nice sound video
Nice
put guns on it hell yea
SO COOL
Expensive
This was my first MKBHD video. I just remember rewatching it over and over. The showmanship and quality was unlike anything I’ve seen. Thank you for changing my life. My tech passion started right about here. Eternally grateful.

The killer intro I have ever seen...
Wow this is a game changer!
i&#39;d sooner try to build one than rent or buy it.

Yowowowowow wow amaziing 🔥
hello what name this viedeo musik ? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=86">1:26</a>
Hmm, they should use vive trackers and allow the camera to follow the position on your hand and key frame it that way.  Would be a lot faster than manually adjusting the camera using the controller for every key.
WOW
looks very cool)))

Wait it is  controlled by a Xbox controller😎😎
Poliiii
@MarquesBrownlee I would develop shots that gave perspective, insight, and understanding on the human condition that all of us share, as well as create shots that showed those perspectives in different &quot;ways&quot; and in different &quot;lights&#39;.  These shots would somehow inspire the good that is inside of all, no matter our backgrounds, religion, beliefs, worldviews, and spiritual freedoms. We would learn from each other no matter how ridgid or concrete they were or are.  They would organically, and inorganically grow and expand as we learn from each other.  Much like the way a group might do in a school classroom, workplace floor, or even inside a hippie commune.    They would somehow try to bring together the very people that didn&#39;t want to be brought together.  How many times has a fresh perspective given me the aha moment I was looking forward to understand, love, or see a person or group of people in a different way, light, and love.  It would also bring people of all differing religions and point-of-views and would find even more common ground as they would delve deeply into each religion and perspective.  While doing this, the shots would bring together what all the religions, even the witch craft, satanism, and others strive, and indeed do.  Not to say one is better, as that sort of understanding and judgement might be as just and loving as one would think.   To better oneself, to better a society.  To find peace in the midst of trials and tribulations.  To give to others in the most altruistic light, and further than that, way of life.  .  The kind of love that transcends human logic and wisdom.  A lot of which this sentence is built upon.
so crisp
Moe Shop. Nice.

With this thing you can do a perfect dolly zoom (I mean vertigo type of shot)
Dummy got another job once ironman left.

biggest concern is how easily someone might get hit by the moving camera
Who could possibly hate on this😮

Didn&#39;t BOLT come up with this long ago?
If you wanna see some precision filming go watch any of Worbles videos. They make dope skate videos!!
Awesome robot for music video shooting....  👌👌👌
What a perfectly shot intro !!!
&quot;Watashi ga, Kira Yoshikage&quot;  &quot;Kira Queeen&quot; :P
That into is the coolest thing in the world
What a well shot video! I hope one day this technology will be mainstream.
I’d use this to make an awesome music video!!
I would use it for a porno shoot
All Industrial robotic engineers are like...<br>Wait. That&#39;s illegal....<br><br>Seriously. This robot will kill you if you step in its way. 😅
Outro oh mannnnnn!!

I’ve watched this video a million times, I just love how <b>*woosh*</b> the camera is, y’know!
here because TWD season 10 teaser - silence
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I&#39;m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don&#39;t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I&#39;m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I&#39;m trying to explain that I&#39;m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn&#39;t lose to anyone.
Kira?<br>Mia?<br>Someone&#39;s watching death note!
Anybody watching it in quarentain ?
Bitza dusto!
Nice
maybe get some speedrunners to help you program that thing, they are used to frame by frame inputs<br><b>edit</b> the ones that do the tool assisted speedruns

Its sooo nice to see, that &quot;no robot specialised&quot; ppl think, their robot will work for a cam. but they dont. if u look very exactly, u can see some wobble and some shaky footage. thats, for what cheap robots are made of. REAL robots, will work for that - but not that overpriced shit. thats it.
Also the video is sponsored by Xbox 😉
Look up:<br>Sofia Carson GlamBOT<br>The most famous of this kind of cameras, they&#39;ve been doing amazing celebrity shots at the red carpet. Amazing work
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=229">3:49</a> Look at marques... Gotcha
Going to need a bigger bank account😐
надеюсь в следующем айфоне такую добавят ))
Ok anna mmm...

GLaDOS soon^tm ? o.o
So Stray Kids - God&#39;s Menu were used this camera right??
I wonder if there&#39;s any way to export the camera move and import it into After Effects so you don&#39;t have to solve for camera movement! Also, I really want one.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=228">3:48</a> i got memed :(
Very good Camara
true space and time so thats basically a tardis??
Its the God of the New World!!
porn, obviously. Was that a rhetorical question?
blackpink teasers be like
What about cameraman&#39;s future ..! you kicked on their stomach and talent..! i&#39;m not agree with you, sorry bro..!
That robot is gay. It uses an xbox controller
In future robots will do the talking/acting and humans will be in cages as pets.
Camera be like:<br>👀........👀..................👀
Dear santa...
Well, you bought Mia. I guess it was better anyways. I&#39;m from the future to know this.
pornhub should rent that robot
I could use this when skating, so it pans round behind me as well as spinning back to the front
Stick around till the END OF THE VIDEO guys, MKBHD transforms into Tony Stark for a few moments :))

Imagine this + a live Photogrammatry view. would be sick to see everything on your pc and have a CGI-like workflow with that.
reminds me of &quot;B-TIGHT - ICH BIN&#39;S&quot; video from 2007 (german Rap)
he is making to much ads
Blackpink teasers use it i think

Hell Yeah for Moe Shop intro
Oque significa dope tech? Eu não consegui entender
Death note<br>sorry <br><br>Death photographer<br><br>Lol
I would use it for porn
Bastard
All boys start unsubscribe him... What video he do,,,, that not clear
Eyy fucky man ur Video not good
I&#39;ve always been fascinated with cool camera shots AND robot arms, this one is definitely higher end and insanely impressive. Vid just showed up in my recommended, you&#39;ve got my sub!
Robot waving I was laughed
Aye Oregon my home town
This is so dope
Now add some sensors to it, some A.I. and bam... all cameramen are replaced with programmers
Ты продажный фу таким быть
porn?
Every tech company is using this setup in their commercials .
Is the Kira robot used in the Ski Mask Nuketown music vid?
Nice end XD
one robot name is kira and the other is mia , looks like they watch a lot of death note
TBH it looks like a KUKA industrial robot with some less safety.
this with eye tracking so it is always in front where you look without keyframes... would be insane
Bro, I always though this kinda stuff was done in CGI exclusively
oh my gosh I have the same picture as my wallpaper
pls lowcut in intro xd      triggerd my Neighbor
Could still notice wobbles.
Shots feels mesmerising.
Shis robot better not have a death note hiding.
Its just awesome i loved your video
Just another job automation eliminates.
actually the intro was DOPE
Would be nice to put it back of a truck or something, and get some craaaaazy shots of some exotics, or wild JDM cars wilding out on the road.
to film dope porn
maybe use it to see how my ass looks from behind in 4k
Where’s USA shirt. Then used metric system. <br>Us: Who are you!?
The software looks sick.
What if it wasn&#39;t secured right and the red camera dropped lol.
Fire intro dude
The ending.👏🏽👌🏽
Pornhub better step their game up and get one
Any chance you have a link to the bkgd on that pro-art?  Also just a question, but couldn&#39;t you use the phone&#39;s gps or internal gyro via the software to help pull focus?  Wondering if that would lower the amount of needed takes with that phone shot.
i would 100% automate that to give me food and water while i&#39;m gaming
just so good quality
Sweet Video Dude. Very Very Cool Kit. Keep up the great work. Nick🧔🏽.

That robot&#39;s name is KIRA , why is nobody talking about this...
Does he get to keep that??
I love your peace ✌️
Imagine how crazy this would be, to show a man who never have seen technic before.
I genuinely thought he was joking when he said it’s controlled with an Xbox controller.. i was awkwardly waiting for the “just kidding”

All the shots feel too fast to be appreciated
Need that for my robot army
Hahahaha I know this is a very old video and Marques has a robot by now, but youtube thought is should watch it. Love that final shot. his proud smile hahaha great stuff
I&#39;m the only one who noticed that robots called after Death Note characters - Kira, Mia?
Buen video, eres un grande bro un abrazo
using the camera robot to film the camera robot
Light&#39;s reincarnation
I would use this for my Twitch channel. To make immersive face cam transitions.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=370">6:10</a> sure you&#39;re a human, marques, sure

So you move to the wrong place and a giant, massive robot arm hits you in the face with 3 m/s speed?<br><br>Also how did I end up here after buying a videomic go as a big step forward in my filmmaking goals?
Спасибо большое 👍🤜🤛<br>Thanks a lot 👍🤜🤛

Iron Man Inspiration?
This needed to be on a pick up truck on the cab roof bolted and safely secured and with longer arms and so we can see how that new 2021 vehicle looks while driving on the road.?!?.!?.!!!!!
I&#39;ll use to make drone shots by mounting it on a pickup truck and shot some drifters around a corner
Welcome back to another episode of: &quot;Sickest Intros Ever&quot;
Damn.. imagine spending six figures on gear like this! Amazing!
Too much shitty music and too loud
Я здесь один руский?
Kira reminds me of Death Note.
Well, look awesome.  I just wondering how much is the rent?
Amazing video maaayuuuun, can some one tell me what was the music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=361">06:01</a>??
You can use it to film like David Fincher...
But why a Xbox controller
wow &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
The only thing holding back these guys in the Probe Lens video was the human error. Imagine KIRA with a Probe Lens.
Why Xbox controller?
insane
Fuck you
Whyare you using xbox controler?

Christ I can&#39;t wait until I can afford one of these babies for my Youtube channel :)
It&#39;s great to see robots everywhere!<br>Check out  Channel Bro !
its not robot. its still remote controlled camerag rig with many axis. not robot. it wont think it will not make those move by it self without programming it.its not robot!
I absolutely love how clean and easy to use the software looks! I expected something way more overloaded and ugly
It&#39;s like animation
These high speed moves look so lame to me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=451">7:31</a> Marques foreshadowing the Glambot
Intro was dope
If you can have a software that can control and locate the setting memory, you can connect the camera, it will be more practical than this. This time of shooting a lens setting control and setting will make the whole shooting more troublesome
L is listening.
im shocked that potato jet do a video on this yet. thats a serious robot
Nice cam bro
&quot;Kira has been responsible for tons of shots&quot;<br>Yeah dude, I know
Def takes a video to the next level, cool stuff
Robot: I&#39;m pretty great.<br><br>Daniel Schiffer: Hold my Gear.....
When do we just call this what it is. Skynet.
That&#39;s really creepy cause I was watching this Humble song today and was impressed by the robot camera move, I only asked the question in my mind no one knew it, and at the same day, I found a video of you in 2018 recommended lol, anyways Good job brother, thanks for the video!
You can tell Marques had SO MUCH fun making this! Still my favorite of his videos.
sick!!

MKBHD looks like when an ad comes
Moe shop as your intro music, that&#39;s dope
@wasltymedia
Reminds me of Tony Stark’s assistant robot.
Yes it&#39;s amazing to see how<br>Young black kid in USA got so much talent <br>Keep the job in America will stop them going to jail <br>Please help them<br>Thank you!
Just put some wheels on that thing for true fusion...
I was thinking of buying this to start my youtube channel. Im investing all my money in it.
Came from Boss B*tch
thats so dope, wonder when this will be available like dji style consumer level
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=82">1:22</a>what mv is that?
Think about all the cinematographers losing their jobs because of this
No offense but i would probably use it to film a sex tape. jk
I was just talking to my fiancé about if I won the lottery, I would buy this and master it. You can easily create new styles of shots in cinema.
What&#39;s the cost of this machine
Why is there a loud high-pitch tone in this video? I&#39;ts very annoying!
This is insane !!!
Nice :)  I am a serial entrepreneur and a software engineer looking to work with great startup. If you&#39;re the founder of one feel free to connect with me in my personal instagram: @cruzfelixofficial

Mark ass Brown Lee.
filming is about content and a good story. <br><br>thats why CGI, 3d or 360° failed, already.
All that work and knowledge so that some dude can rap about his left stroke being viral. SMH
I would love to borrow kira for a weekend, and then attach a fleshlight to her... wink wink
They kind look like KUKA&#39;s robots, the second robot is like the  KR6 R700 !!

Guys what&#39;s the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=362">6:02</a>
We are curious to see it in your studio.
Dear sir I created a YouTube channel but you tell me some stories people are watching
Moving a Red camera 9ft/s, I see a few injured/dead actors from this.
it was about 3pm and i fell asleep to watching this
But why is the image shaking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=328">5:28</a>?
Awesome gear!
They definitely used these in tron legacy
Markez, Bro, why aren&#39;t you practicing social distancing?
That thing has the potential of being Dangerous, in stating the obvious, however nice robot. i&#39;d arm wrestle it...
I would use that as a weapon of mass destruction
A 2eding shot whith this it would be sik.
Who&#39;s here after Trance malayalam movie
honestly i would donate it to my highschool film class, great teacher who really seemed to love working with film and camera equipment
For the porn industry  👍
iron man vibes
I  came here after i see this tech used in  a movie called TRANCE IN MALAYALAM
I could get similar shots with a small drone and a GoPro. Obviously not as precise or high quality but worth the price difference, in my opinion, with a similar outcome. But I also don&#39;t know much about filming so...    lol
youtube algorithme marques .....
3 m/s is 3*(60*60) is 10800 m/h which is almost 11 kph, which means around 6.5 mph, which is a lot with that degree of precision
KIRA QUEEN HAS ALREADY TOUCHED THAT CAMERA
Let&#39;s shoot with this..... Xbox controller in hands<br>Me thinking: are they gonna use a gun with that device.
I&#39;d be too afraid of this thing flooding the room with deadly neurotoxins.
nuts
DJI Osmo 36
Amazing
one of these days.. Mia is going to slap someone across the face with a camera and continuously hit them lmfao
Хорошая апаратура
As a normal webcam.
no different than a kuka or fanuc. 7th axis is the focus?<br>You shouldn&#39;t be so close to the robot. People around the world have died because the robot will never know you are there.
But, does Kira need Light to work ?<br>I was watching the Probe Lens video and got this question on my head... 🤔
Wow he really went from reviewing a computer remote to reviewing a remote controlled robot camera
( marques ) tilt down ( goes up ) tilt up ( goes down )
I need one..
That thing looks like a robot that will analysis you before entering somr place
Now you can make IRL Anime OP
yeah ps 4
3 meters in one second are 10,8 Km/h
The cutscene music is like OOF SIZE: XXL
Iron Man would need that as a YouTuber😁

So dope.

Does no one notice that the camera is named Kira from death note and the other camera is named Mia from death note. Did they intend that?
1,6k<br> people jealous of you Marques

would love to see this camera and phantom setup as a collab with the slow mo guys!
go play some basket dude
the software is actually really easy to use
Probably should not be playing with Glados
A lot of these shots could be made with an fpv drone and an experienced pilot. its also way more dangerous.. BUT FUN!!!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=68">1:08</a> clearly a 15mm rails setup with nothing on the rails but the camera. So no reason for the rails in that pic but definitely not a slider.

Men... this is so sick! :D  Commercial work is totally crazy with these robots. wow
The problem I have with making Videos is that I don&#39;t have any actors for my Videos other then myself, because all my friends don&#39;t like acting. And they don&#39;t use movie cameras a lot they also don&#39;t relly know how to use thoose. Means I have to be the camera man and the actor at the same time. That is why I can only do steady shots which is very boring. So I would use this camera robot to make my own videos more exciting.
It reminds me of the controls of a flying drone in COD multiplayer
very cool
Glambot inspired by mkbhd
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=320">5:20</a> song?
I would use it to make my products.
what you need to study to use those things? cinema, photography or what???
mount a 50 cal machine gun there and you will see
i wonder that, does ppl use it for porn shooting?
Humble!!!
Of course the robots will have cameras, how else will they be able to see us as they are chasing us into our terminator bunkers?
The Marmalade Identity, Germany, many years ago.
I like it. But there is noticable wobble in many of the shots. In the Macbook shot at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=330">5:30</a> when the camera stopped before he closes it. That might  have been the table, not the camera (maybe the cable hit it?). But at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=88">1:28</a> (last shot) it really threw me off, the wobble there was enormous. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=458">7:38</a> the slow motion also wobbly.

sick shots
In industry it is forbidden to be in the agitation space of robot. Do these robots have some sort of security mechanism?
If something this were available at a prosumer level, it would be really cool to use for homemade motion control VFX!
Nice,but this is a KuKa robot ...
this is just an application

Challenge mode: find a way to get shots like these without robot arms.
Order CGI animation, i will do it 5 times cheaper, and better quality.
dope tech camera awesome
the intro was  more dramatic
There&#39;s so much camera wobble at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=454">7:34</a> specifically on the Y-axis. <br>Was there too much weight on the system? That would be very painful to fix in post =(
Славяне есть?!)
Guys, can I fix the wires that hang down? they can slightly increase the shake in the frame

The top Down on the MacBook with the music blew my mind. It was so dope.
I&#39;m works with abb robots every day, it seems ridiculously easy to set something like that. . .
I call em CINE-CAM
Allow me to use This dope tech + another dope tech (probe lens) and I&#39;ll show you what magic is......
Excellent video Marques
Face recognition or 3D sensor would be cool with it. :)
I just can’t imagine Getting hit in the face with that😅
everybody gangsta till the camera starts writing down names in a notebook
is motorized precision on the stock market on the stock market?
Very impressive but the way the robot camera moves is really scary lmao
Damn, this would be dope is they can make a mobile version.  Travel videography would be awesome.
Do a video with Weebo(Flubber Movie Robot).
i will need a link to every song in this video XD

Hey my dad coded this you should check out concept systems
Never saw a review of Edelkrone gear. Is it because you wouldn&#39;t consider using it at all? Thanks.
You&#39;re bragging about this robot arm and let the cables hang so ugly. Redo again, redo it right.
the shots and pulls are so good and dead on they actually seem faked. thats awesome
THAT&#39;S AMAZING
Imagine using this to film people playing ping pong
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=369">6:09</a> not for long.
Bro imagine a porn director using this thing... Mmmm some top tier content right there ;)
bro why he sound like the dude from &quot;sorry to bother you&quot;
badass!
What if you watched a porno with that camera arm
Orkundan nerelere geldim amk

Very nice Information

Great job on vid awesome robots
When the camera get&#39;s SUPER close and focuses perfectly. That&#39;s what makes it look &quot;fake&quot; or made in cgi

Anyone know where I can find the desktop background at 5.28 ?

i&#39;ll use it for tiktoks<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>well
Man, Robots and AI will really remove all Jobs for Humans, even Camera People (or how you call them)!<br><br><br>and that&#39;s a good thing :)
This gives me &#39;No Handlebars&#39; vibes, anyone else pepeLaugh
Атомная штука)))) за ней будущее
that moment when you realize the monitor in the background(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=228">3:48</a>) has the same wallpaper xD
WE ARE NOT RICH
tbh i thought the controlling via Xbox controller was a joke xD
pretty standard robot repurposed for filming, look up abb robots. also not called hinges but axis
I am here in silicon valley Cali working in the semiconductor area, I want to learn from the mechanical backlash master.
We live in a weird era of technology. It&#39;s so good that we can make CGI shots look real, and make real shots look like CGI.
first time I saw one of these was in marmalade videos and they were called Spikes.
The way the camera moves itself looks unreal
USE IT FOR PORN!

Shout-out for the ones who think about Death Note when they heard Kira.
Mr. Robot used one of these shots in the finale to amazing comedic and dramatic effect
The Top Down shot at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=320">5:20</a> was epic
If I had your sort of money I would film with that thing every time I upload 😂
Cod Montages in Real Life
This guy acts more white than white people HAHAHAH
Death note fans ↓
Glados is doing a good job at filming!
Very cool +1
imagine using this to shot a fighting sequence.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=123">2:03</a> give that controller to one of us gamers.. <br>we will make that camera shoot real bullets, go for cover and snipe any target.
i want to see slow motion basketball shot with this rig
You need to invert your controller.
No wabble or shake? Hum The Top Down shot ? From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=320">5:20</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=330">5:30</a>? Btw check out Ulysse Camera Cranebot, French tech if I&#39;m correct!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=223">3:43</a> song?

That’s so very important
Cool video man!
On the last one, you should have fly over the head and get the back shot how Marques disappears in the crowd without change of his direction. Music turns on as he puts the headphones on. That&#39;s all in the streets of Manhattan..
&quot;And if you put a slo-mo camera like a Phantom Flex the number of shots you could get on this would be almost endless&quot;<br> - GavinFree has entered chat -
this would be great with the probe lense!
shhhht - dont tell anyone, Kira is an ABB Robot. For this kind of work i would use a special edition from Stäubli they are more silent than Kira ;) Another good to know: You can verry easily destroy the mounted Camera System
Nice vid.
To pass the butter
The GLaDOS of cameras.
mark ass brownie
i want one
Anyone else way more impressed with the programming? Tho the tech IS super cool
Mark Ass Brownie
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=90">1:30</a> Kira is the tool.
my first thought is that would be the dopest porn u would ever shoot if using this thing.... oneday i would like to see it.... for real
Through space and time? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=144">2:24</a> Wow, that is some future tech!
WOW
imaginen en el futuro una ia que sustituya a youtubers como Marques Brownlee y que presenten estos robots
I Swear, Marques is the whitest black person on the planet
a skate video, and play with the slowmotion
He said up “camera goes down”. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=135">2:15</a><br>The down “camera goes up”
rig to a vehicle, shoot epic car chase...
Love the Video, Things Robots can do now is mindblowing. It gets better every day.
in  a few years china will probably make a drone cam that can do all that  :-p
Plot twist: The robot is CGI and so is all the footage
This is so cool, great video
Markass
Buy one!!
Does the name &quot;Kira&quot; come from death note?
Imagine the possibility of VR implementation into the mapping of the movements of these robots. Incredible technology.
those videos are so ... sigh..
It looks like a giant monster when she is targeting the object
i recommend you guys to see the virts cardistry video it was filmed using a robotic camera and in slow mo it is so dope
I bet that i`m not the only one who would like to see porno filmed with this !  and a 8k red camera ...
all i got from this was camera people are the next ones out of work after truckers and cashiers.
After jerry rig everything?
Базару нет, четко
You should use this with that probe lense you have
Wow! It`s amaing!
This has actually been a thing for a long time with huge motion control rigs from the 70s onward.
I really thought shots like this were fully animated.
has anyone shot porn with it yet
<b>GLaDOS has joined the game</b>
Impressive for a film people, but as someone who has worked in automation it&#39;s pretty meh
SuperSuperSuper!!!
wow, that&#39;s really cool
&quot;You know, being Kira taught me a valuable lesson. I thought you were my greatest enemy. When all along you were my best friend.&quot;
Ahh clearly time to start my own youtube channel, brb getting 400k camera.
i think that apple use a ton of this robots :)
mark ass brownie
as soon as i saw the first clip i was like &quot;this is like that kendrick lamar vid.&quot;
Great stuff as always.    I was wondering what robots they were actually using? <br><br>I work for Yaskawa, Motoman, in Ohio, and would really like to try some things on my own in our lab here.    Would be fun to do.   For nothing more then to play or film our own stuff.    Not to try and get into anything they do there.
Make a mindfuck movie with video mindfucks
Did anyone get Linus Tech Tips Adv.
anyone have the link to the wallpaper at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=328">5:28</a>?

Probe lens + Kira pls!!!!
Dope
but can it make me a sandwich?
this would be really cool in a music video
damnnnn
this is still one of the best dope tech in 2019/2020
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=79">1:19</a> the answer is BOLT
Hey man, great video. Can you give me a N-word pass?
my use of a robot like this? I would rent it out for profit.
A regular robot with a camera being held by it... for the price tag just buy an industrial KUKA, ABB or FANUC and stick a cam in it. Programming them is for dummies.
SO that&#39;s how Stormzy made Vossi Bop
So fake
I would use it to get pussy

RIP Marques Brownlee, killed by a robot arm.
Wait.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w&amp;t=124">2:04</a> is this xbox ON?
Imagine this in the porn industry!!!!!!!!!

Reasons why Xbox is better than PlayStation: this video
My use case would be exactly what you said at the end, slow mo ultra high speed tracking shots.. That, or have it as our main podcast cam, imagine that xD
