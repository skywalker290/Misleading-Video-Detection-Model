1000 drone show coming ?
I just love the hardwork what they do and the outro sound of intel....I just loved it❤️❤️
Now it is made in India<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_OVQfo63Rw">https://youtu.be/8_OVQfo63Rw</a>

Brasília de  2021 ♾ inteligência artificial!!!!!
I want to learn everything about drone light show. Is there any course for this?
Great job on Tokyo 2020
The drone is very well constructed.
All the dislikes from AMD freaks...
The difference between 100 and 500 isn&#39;t &quot;mindblowing&quot;.  It&#39;s 400......
Liar!!! The difference between 500 and 100 is not &quot;mind blowing&quot; its 400!!
please play bad apple with that
They mentioned 💯 drone in video and title mentioned 500 drone 😂!!! <br>Intel bro tum bhi hamr le rahe ho 😂 keep it up
No intel technology involved in this
Presente
When the finals of Eurovision 2015 took place in Austria, there was an amazing display coordinated with separately controlled reflective spheres.  Can this kind of display be performed with these drones as well?
So ufo don’t exits
Who else is here to prove to someone that all the TikTok UFO videos are drone light shows
i9 10900k inside
That was very cool .
hola realmente buen video desearía que permanezcan haciendo contenido similar...  Voy a seguir mirando sus creaciones. Les mando un abrazo nos vemos luego ❤️👍🏽
Man-0-Man, THAT is some AWESOME stuff right there!
what was the budget for the &#39;light and night show?&#39;
I just want to know how they charge them.
Now for new year instead of loud explosion all we hear are the whirring and humming of the drones.
AMD is better
Maybe it more safety than fireworks show
Where&#39;s the mothership
Next time.  Lets watch a cinema in the sky.   Making 10,000-20,000 drones flyes on the sky and make it like pixels
Im gonna start in my countrt
INSPIRED BY SPIDERMAN
Chinese already took the tech not new anymore
Mysterio is here
Can I please get a i9-9900k?
Looks great! <br>And what control application is used in Intel 500 Drone Light Show?<br>Thanks!
ohh shiet mysterio finna be real
Astounding...!
We’re waiting for 2500
Yeah... i buy you 800$ laptop yeah 30 fps<br>My iphone is 60 fps wow i guest i should use mac book
501 drones, 1 is for the camera drone.
Mati love jujur mau gimana prank/suprice #1. They can tell something not serious for dead Skype country.
Could make a god out of those things 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ and control the weak minded

Future of ads
2019: <b>let&#39;s do 1000</b>
Intel is being smart by becoming a drone company since they&#39;re soon to be out of the CPU market.
Mysterio needs your location 🤣🤣🤣
Mysterio tech???
EDITH ? is that you , Mr Stark ?
Literally amazing!!!
Some lights are not working
Cool, but then it reminded me of military purpose and a new warfare age. A terrible one. Just as the inventor of the atombom
Woooow!!!!!!!
Wow!!!
DID INTEL MAKE TOO DRONES
You know something&#39;s off when a huge corporate logo is the highlight of the show.
<b>Intel inside</b>
If they can form a globe, they can form an attack pattern.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=133">2:13</a> &quot;Hisamitsu&quot;
How do we contact you guys about doing a light show?
Mysterio did that.
This is the first time I don&#39;t hear the INTEL&#39;s sound while the logo shows up in a video.
This would make for an excellent opening ceremony for any rich Olympic city
Are these UFOs (or IFOs)?
Vary beautiful
This video disappoints me.  It&#39;s a beautiful display, but this video doesn&#39;t discuss any of the technology.  The drone tech, the design, the software, possibilities for future use.  To be frank, this video is dumbed down.  It&#39;s a feel-good advertisement devoid of anything technically interesting.  Do they think we don&#39;t want to know?  We do!  Please, Intel, for the love of all that is good.  Talk to us about technical things -- amaze us with the genius behind the light show.
maybe is a simple i think for about made it too. and design ligth 5D.
New World Record is with EHang Co. <br>Intel is a big time looser in 21st century. This era is not of MS Windows 95, that helped Intel to grow on its monopoly. No future of Intel for sure.
Should of put some drones with dangling led strips like shooting stars!
How i contact with intel for droon light show?
whats name of music in this video?
Xoven nerd
COOL
There always at least one Indian in the group
Can we please do this for New Years Eve everywhere instead of the massively (air)polluting fireworks??
amazing
I guess our world does have some magic to it after all.
it turned out spectacularly
put some water on those, and go put those fires out!
I want to know what they could do with 10 k drones
Amazing.
Nice Weapon
Now its a question of making the drones smaller, brighter, and further responsive.<br><br>Future challenge - Make a swarm of brighter 10000 LED drones with a size no more than 10 centimetres each, encased in a spherical Buckminsterfullerene like structure for protection. Then make them fly amongst the crowd.
MORE
Classic....!!!
Put the cell phones down. Remember this for the moment.
HOW DID I ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS NOW??? 2 Years Later??????? <br><br>This is absolutely AWESOME!
一想到世界和平就想到以人為本謝宗言lst232
Roll&#39;s royce will test 3400 drones synchronized!
Amazing! We&#39;d like to do this in the DMV area. Let&#39;s chat!
I watched everyone of these Intel drone videos all I seen was a bunch of people talking and a two second light show
AMERICA!
I really want to experience this somewhere in the world.<br><br>By the way, this video was fantastic and incredible to watch ;-)
Skynet + &#39;Shooting&#39; Stars 😂
&quot;Shooting&quot; stars . Right.
where/how can I buy a set?
better than fireworks
How long until someone calls this in as an alien invasion LOL.
Is this even real
Only 500 no way Intel China has flew more than 1000
10000
5000
2500
Next year 1000
Then 500
100
What? Only 100?
Awesome
But y though
Wow !! I have had dreams about this when I was a kid the intel ad in the sky.A true dream come true im <br>very impressed.
awsome , good job intel guys
So all UFO capturing till now was just a Intel drones on the sky..... 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Looks animated
Looks animated
&gt;never last year
&quot;the difference between 100 and 500 is.... Mind-blowing&quot;<br>let me help, it&#39;s 400
Should put brighter lights on them and have them hover above you and follow you so it is always bright
I just want one drone!!
Cool
Ok, I want to buy 2000 of these.  Beats the crap outta catching fireflies.  Seriously cool.  Almost sci-fi looking.
When will Disney buy about 1,000 of these is my question
Still your stock fan suck
Wow
This is awesome
what you do when you make too much money....
faker then faker
Is this like a hive mind
later 500drones killing 1 whole cities
shoooooooooting staaaaaaar
They look like particles
give me one
SURPISE! all of those fladhing lighrs are actually indicating how long until the bombs that they are carrying denotante
500 drones get millions of views, but what about our bois in 10nm?
Ufologists please take note of this.
It doesn&#39;t look any interesting or amazing at all on the video - thanks the the super short cuts all the atmosphere vanishes totally
Just imagining commissioner Gordon having to drag these out every time he needs Batman....
Wow
God is not happy 👿
Meglio dei fuochi d&#39;artificio! Aspettiamo San Giovanni..
I&#39;d really like to learn what program their using to command &amp; configure all those drones =)
China flew 1000 already!
What is the way of contact with you?<br>We want this performance
Amei! Supera muito os fogos de artifício! Cria  um clima mágico!

How to take something that should be amazing and mind-blowing and turning it into just another politically correct boring run-of-the-mill commercial. I&#39;m very disappointed☹️
now replace de led light bulb with its weight on C4 and you will see the true market for this technology
안뇽하세여
Intel sets a world record? Yes, but only with 20 more drones! There was 1180 drones performance in the sky of Guangzhou during FGF( Fortune Global Forum)  06/12/2017. The pre-recorded show in PyeongChang is a good one nonetheless.
Its just the beginning of police drone swarms harassing innocent civilians
How do you manage with lipo charging? :)
This tec is used in pyeongchang olympic with korean telecom tec
Pity the art is lost in the advertising.
Батарейки зарядить - сразу вешаться можно
FFFFFFUUUUUUTTTTUUUURRREEE -Squidward
mind blowing it is!  👍
平昌で見たゾ
THIS WILL BE USED TO CONTROL ALL OF HUMANITY:  BIGGER DRONES ARE ALLREADY CONTROLING OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD :::THEY ARE MAKING YOU PAY FOR YOUR ONWN INSLAVEMENT ::::AND ITS FUNNY HOW NOBODY IS CRITICAL ABOUT THIS :
wonderful!!!!
Thaks for PyeongChang!
Love the future!
평창 사이버펑크 머박적 ...
5 months working for 5 minutes
Me: Whos going to charge all of those batteries?
This seems a path to something magic, when the energy source is revolutionized and the artificial intelligence is developed.
It&#39;s all fun and games now...but i see them soon, strapted with some bombs by some lunatics.
Next challenge 100,000 drones.
Blow my mind some more. 👽
Can it run on my 486?
Es maravilloso!!!
Well this is just disturbing.
why only white and blue????????????
now put 2000 :)
This has me feeling old, I&#39;ve arrived in the future somehow.
Impressive, but after the Meltdown patch, will the drones fly 30% slower, or just 10%?
How they communicate with each other through a single console?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=69">1:09</a> &quot; special plumisiun&quot;?
Wow they are amazing light from drones.
Человеческая мысль гениальна Потрясающе
amd can not handle even 2 drones :D
Are drones communicating with each other or they are controlled by a centralized ground control system?
Love It!
Humm let&#39;s put some RGB lasers on these drones , OK now that could get interesting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LdaWMNKUHs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LdaWMNKUHs</a>
Yes, but there are 1180 drones operated in Guangzhou last week...
or how to spend money for nothing
Is there a way to contact them?
What is this supposed to tell me about Intel?
digital fireworks
500
Nothing special
Awesome wok!
This is next level shit.
love them drones good war all manner of things as the Iraqi people and the Palestinians
Scared a lot of people xD look like UFOs
Its Canada?
Hi guys , how can I get hold of you for an event ?
intel the best.! see you soon , I hope so
So amazing...
Godamn! Feels like in the future
1000 drones at 2017 new year event.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnTQTm7vNbY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnTQTm7vNbY</a>
best processing stuff man!!!!!
Awesome!  We filmed it! Here is the Light Show video!
Aliens
Just watch, next thing you know fireworks are gonna be talking about how drones took their jobs lol
a friend of mine got his drone and killed it going full trottle to the wall in 5 sec<br> so yeah you guys are doing better
imagine a floating screen in the sky? Like show video threw the drones? There is a ton of potential with this
EASY TO BREAK GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS  WHEN YOUR BUDGET IS AS HIGH AS THE MOON
I wanna watch &quot;999-Drones&quot;
FAKE IT IS A COMMERCIAL STUNT
Well, impressive video.  however, in the early days of computing you would be shown how to build a radio, a 555 timer circuit or shift register.  Where O where is the sharing of this technology?  Educate the world used to be the motto of large organisations, building the interest of a new generartion of engineers.  Appears now to be all about developing a need to make an extra $.  Steve jobs really needed a trillion dollars to himself; no wonder the schools, roads, parks, hospitals, libraries are in such a state!  Still hoard another buck and the world will be a better place i&#39;m sure.  Come on intel, break the mould and educate the world.  Now thats a real challenge rather than sitting in an armchair made of dollar bills.
I seriously hope one of Intel&#39;s engineers uses this to propose.
Every one of them can carry a handgranade. Now imagine 100 Million or one Billion of drones...
CU on UFO´s are real
No wonder intel cpu&#39;s are overpriced, they need to finance their toys.
who come here because of asian games 2018 in Indonesia ?
Wow
would be better to view in 4K ....Intel come on
I want to hear the buzzing
so these are not Ufo? lol
When Intel does it it&#39;s ok and fun and all that, when aliens do it it&#39;s &quot;UFO!! Call 911!!&quot;
and this concept shows on in indonesia countdown asian games 2018
You would not believe your eyes, if 500 intel drones, lit up the sky as you watched them light up the sky
whats the technology behind this? neural networks?
Amazing, smart
wow very good show. i also make video about 300 drones performance in Singapore National Day
War thunder AA so op it could literally kill every drone in 10 shots
Amazing
I want one of this drone
dude<br>galaga in mid air
The only thing I find fascinating is the drones coordination, that&#39;s some really accurate moves even for a drone, GPS can&#39;t do evrything, interesting.
i bet they will do 1000 by this year
300 drone for Asian games countdown in jakarta ? <br>Can&#39;t wait
no more fireworks, just this.. :)
omg I&#39;m a big fan of intel go intel intel hope u do more do well keep the good work <br>intel is the intel Pentium is good that my pc right now well cya
Masyaa Allah.....
great!
That was EPIC!
New Years eve is all i am sayin
It would be great to use it for a science show, to illustrate how stars orbits in a galaxy, the formation of a solar system or how galaxies interact with each other.
Can we put this in the Philippines? Where I can contact someone who can do it here in PH?
which company did this drone production ?
And then all the drones become red and start chasing people lol
2000 angry bees making my ears bleed
Good stuff!
One of the most beautiful things I&#39;ve ever seen
No more UFO anymore :(  .
The future of fireworks shows, <br><br>how awesome that would be right?
We&#39;re all gonna to die.
10,000 Fireflies is literally possible now
Congratulations
Allah....so awesome !
realy good
So...<br>They develop all the drones, make that one show, and then...throw all the drones in the trash?
You caaaan watch Dronee here <a href="https://twitter.com/c9ff430940b700586/status/865387319120941056">https://twitter.com/c9ff430940b700586/status/865387319120941056</a>
屌炸天
wait. its the intel pi piri pipiri (a shooting star xdd)
i&#39;ll be really impressed when it can play mine craft. ;)
so they used drones as 3d pixels
my friends cousin works for intel
Just ... WOW!!!
It makes me mad that I&#39;ll never be able to afford these things
this is super awesome! amazing
What software do they use to control the drones?
extraordinary
make 999,trillion drones and sent it to thee GOD&#39;S!!!!!!! hehehe
aliens would visit again 10/10
That image in the guys camera in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=115">1:55</a> seems fake
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=133">2:13</a> its a satisfactory sound
CHINA BEAT YOU <br>THEY DID 1000 DRONES
Very beautiful. One of the best scene w/o CGI.
Art!?<br><br>This is OBVIOUSLY being developed for military purposes.
Why don&#39;t all drones have cages?..
Each drone containing i7 processor :D ?
This is Retarded! ... what is the Point of it?
cmon we wanna 1000!!!
Hey, that&#39;s pretty good!
Next goal 5000?
어린이 과학 잡지인 과학소년에서 보고 qr코드를 찍어 봤는데 와~~대단하네요!

Intel developing fleet of drones. Yeah lad, they&#39;re making them to deliver me pizza... :v
expencive toy for stupid idiots
갓인텔 찬양하라 <br>(i7카비레이크 소유자)
fake
China is always over doing things... You did 500 drones and they just did 1000... Hmmm... China...
Why is difference between 100 and 500 mindblowing? Cant exactly the same software handle 500 as handled 100?
...but why?
Reminds me of Ferngully at the end...
it&#39;s unbelivable beauty
The drones and the programming for the remote control for the swarm is out of this world. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
amazing Intel....مدهشةانتي يا شركة أنتل
tenemos la solucion a todas las teorias de la gente q veia luces en el cielo
bum bum bum bum bum ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! too scary
I have a proposal for a park in Dubai back in 2008 with such ideas...in fact mine was a bit ahead of these guys...<br>i used those drone like objects to generate their own power from sun and wind..<br>you would be able to see these here...<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/232112240284477/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=251306528365048">https://www.facebook.com/232112240284477/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=251306528365048</a><br><br><a href="http://bustler.net/news/896/non-winners-announced-for-thyssenkrupp-elevator-architecture-award-2008-2009">http://bustler.net/news/896/non-winners-announced-for-thyssenkrupp-elevator-architecture-award-2008-2009</a>
What if it was superwindy at the time of Superbowl? Would the drone show have been cancelled? I dont think that light copters can take much wind...
This is not mind blowing AT ALL ! just a simple 3D triangulation / positioning used with radio strength beacon  a technology in every Iphone now - or Ibeacon - a strong wind and all go to disarray ! they don&#39;t communicate with each other - one beacon down and all is a mess.
Yes! NOW LET PUT GUNS ON THEM! c:
I am amazed, I love lights!
This is how Skynet will murder us all.
Skynet.
I want to buy a fleet
Daniel can get it
I wonder how they conquer the battery change issue for a mass number of drones.
UFO sightings are about to go up heheh
How sick would this be for a New Years/4th of July fireworks (&quot;drone works&quot;) display be!  Intel.....start planning now!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=50">0:50</a> Pewds? Is that you?
That just has to make you smile
HOLOGRAMS. Like, really big, low res holograms, but still, holograms. That&#39;s basically what I&#39;m seeing. Imagine this concept in 20 more years with 5X more drones that are even more compact? You&#39;ve seen ads on banners pulled behind prop planes. Imagine 2500 drones buzzing overhead telling you to buy Trojan lol
New fireworks
This would be so much better than fireworks for 4th of July!
Who else is here thx to Philip De Franco?
I would love to see this at a theme park like before or after a firework show.
Does anyone know what piece of music is playing until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=22">0:22</a>?
345600 FOR SD <br>2073600 FOR hd <br>8294400 FOR 4K<br><br>better get to work guys ...
It&#39;s the Seeker Swarms from Mass Effect 3!!!!!!!!
Now make it 5000
This did not happen during the superbowl -_- this happened over a week ago. and was pre-recorded.
I have a dream, write it in the sky as I love my partner. you help me?
cool！
Awesome! I have a lot of doubts about it. I want to do the same show, but it for the anniversary foundation school when I study.
Thanks for sharing.
superbowl
Me and everyone else in my family thought the stars and flag was all CGI, but then at the end of the halftime show they had a little picture on the screen and they said &quot;Drones sponsored by Intel&quot;. I was like, &quot;THOSE ARE DRONES? OMG!&quot;
In a couple of years this drones will be used to show the countdown of the new year. And ads, lots of ads
im here from the superbowl halftime
implement CREE XM-L T6  on every drone and have a local SUN. I know, we&#39;ll see that soon
sorprendente
Amazing &amp; Wonderful
soon we will have thousands of these in micro form to make a jumbo screen in the sky to watch movies and stuff. this could be the future of holograms.
Fireworks Display 2.0
That super bowl drone setup was SO COOL guys... damn.
The future of fireworks
Now imagine producing millions of these drones and filling up the night sky over an entire city.
now Geico can advertise aerial banners at night 🙃
Great to see the innovation and safety!
Super Bowl drones on Feb 5, 2017 were filmed before the Super bowl due to FAA regulations.   <a href="https://flipboard.com/@flipboard/flip.it%2FcsUQDL-the-super-bowl-halftime-show-drones-wer/f-9f8afece02%2Ftheverge.com">https://flipboard.com/@flipboard/flip.it%2FcsUQDL-the-super-bowl-halftime-show-drones-wer/f-9f8afece02%2Ftheverge.com</a>
很美！很棒，很有创意！~
so its confirmed UFO is actually drone from future all along?
You know maybe you could kill a president with a swarm of these and a small C4 charge on each one....
Turns out UFO sightings were just Time Travelers playing with their drone fleets.
Drones taking over your job fireworks.
&quot;The difference between 100 and 500 is mindblowing.&quot;<br><br>According to my research, it&#39;s about 5 times less. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ididthemath">#ididthemath</a>
used for Half Time Show
I want to see this stuff at disneyland every night ASAP
Really cool!
but the battery life has too be extremely long...
I saw this on the Superbowl and thought it was CGI but when I found out it was real... I still can&#39;t believe it.
chime in if you&#39;re here because of the half time show.  :)
Went here after Lady Gaga&#39;s Half Time Show.
wheres drone 1000
they should have put these in the shape of an Illuminati symbol that would have freaked someone out.
INTELLIGENCE drones dancing ALL round the Worldwide billions of jobs in the worldwide
lady gaga super bowl 2017
Gaga brought us here. Show us more, show us an awesome show!
Gaga use this for superbowl omg WIG
GAGA SB
Yep they are doing the Super Bowl can&#39;t wait
This it will happen at the Super Bowl 2017!!!Lady Gaga will slay!!
Gagaaaaaa
Gaga at the Super Bowl 😍
Gaga
So i heard this wiill be used on the SuperBowl Halftime show with Gaga? I&#39;m not surprised since Gaga and Intel have partnered a couple of times now
Lady Gaga vai usar no Super Bowl, só não ver quem não quer.
GAGA AT THE SUPER BOWL!!!
LADY GAGA SUPER BOWL 2017
GAGA SUPERBOWL 51
wow !
WHat kind of witchcraft is this
Watch Disneyland put these shows on in a couple of years. You heard it HERE first. 👉😎👉
swarm one of these over the Whitehouse and see what reactions you&#39;re gonna get from the guards
INTEL IS LIFE AND FUTURE !!
Best ufo sighting so far!
woooooooooooooow
If everyone believes that INTEL is responsible for the red orbs and daytime triangles etc ....get ready .....cause they can be imitated but drones fly ...UFOS materialize yUFOS don&#39;t make sound are as big as cars and they DONT FLY they don&#39;t bank they don&#39;t have alighted fixtures similar to any of these displays . I cant believe the arrogance . So intel ....when can we expect to see your drones show up in a random location after being signaled at a random location at a random time? Obviously you haven&#39;t seen the real thing and it frustrates you enough to create the fake UFOS yourself huh? How about the ones that have been seen in space by astronauts? Are they crazy too? UFOS are real ! Get used to it.peace christo
Nice. Make a million of those drones and have a km long screen. The future is here
Swarm of army drones when?
only 4k likes wtf
AWESOME! Now fake a alien invasion!
Wow, what a creative idea.
Intell knows how to spend their money.
I know it would be a bit of a hack but why not have 4 LEDs on each drone so in certain configurations you can have a much higher resolution?
blue beam project
SKYNET just few years...
jak wy to zrobiliście?
OMG. Is  that possible?
well this is freaky as i was going to share this link last night to a ufo sight as i dont think everyone is aware how awsome and clever these drones are. people have designed flying cars!! drone gps flying machines  capable of 200mph yes technology just took a giant leap. at last.
WHAT A HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AND RESEARCH... <br>IM SURE THE &quot;FLEET&quot; WAS MADE IN CHINA AND WHO ARE THOSE ALIENS WHO BEARLY SPEAK ENGLISH
더 많은 드론을 이용하여 홀로그램 같은 입체 영상을 만들어도 될 것 같아요<br>I think I could make hologram-like stereoscopic images with more drones.
crying because I will not get 1,000 likes
대단하군요...<br>미래가 보입니다.<br>So great!!<br>We can see our futures.<br>We will fly soon.. no more ground cars
do you have a full light show video
2D video wouldn&#39;t do this justice
lady gaga really need these at the superbowl next year!!!
Hello, Could you please help me find the person to talk to regarding the Drone Light Show services as pertains to events?
다음 촛불집회때 청와대 하늘에 박근혜 하야 드론쇼 좀 해주세요
i could single handedly write the AI for the drones using both my hands.
why just a 2min video of this? :(
that was pretty cool! But not as cool as my droning videos! check them out! lol
fabuloso!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=40">0:40</a> The difference between 100 and 500 is actually 400...
Waoow...
where is the 500 Drone Light Show ?
Cant wait until millions of these things in swarms with military hardware are hacking cities and major infrastructure.  Fun times.
well done !
Anybody knows, what mark of drones are using here?<br>Help pls!)
What if the batteries run out?
Beautiful time to live in
Обалдеть!
mind blowing
preparing us for the alien landing
coming soon......Sky Television.....
I&#39;m trying to know the ost of this video. Would you tell me a name of this music?
And we thought UFOs exists... They are all drones being tested by NASA...
Call me when you can screen a full movie while drones are flying in the air.  It shouldn&#39;t be so hard... I imagine you keep them flying with different LED colors adjusted for the movie, which change as required by it.  It would make it really nice if they can be on a 3D array.  That would be a step up for entertainment.
hello! my english is not good! So, were can I find this drons. how it cost/ I leave in Ukraine, where can I buy it?
<b>Goodjob Intel &lt;3</b>
hmm, the show really was better last time.<br><br>Rather do something internet-y, like surprising a loved one by bringing a sky of stars to a cloudy night sky and watch their eyes light up?<br><br>come on intel, you got these drones, now do something nice with them :)<br><br>flying 500 drones may be cool, but until you really explain what the difficulty is, when just flying more drones, then this is hardly recognizable as a big thing. to me it looks like you just took 500 drones instead of 100 and let them do a thing.<br><br>i just watched the 100 drone video again: that video deserves to be on the internet. quite a shame that this video here seems to overtake your first one soon...
WOW!
I wonder how does it sound.
Music Festivals... EDC, Coachella, Tomorrowland, Bonnarroo... Twinkle Twinkle..
waoh magnificent
А в это время на россии устроили массовые соревнования по киданию коровьих лепешек. Симметричный ответ так сказать
great!!!!!
We have finally discovered all the secret to all of the hoax alien videos.
They should show this on next Olympic opening ceremony. Digital Fireworks.
I think it&#39;s a great idea !<br>We will see more UFO !! ?   :-)
RESPECT &amp; LIKE :-) :-) :-)
disneyland needs to get on that instead of fireworks show
magnifique coordination pour un très beau spectacle et un étonnant atterrissage à 500 unités lumière, très bon contrôle numérique, chapeau.
Порядочно!
Crazy, hopefully one day we can get drones/ lasers/ fireworks and holograms together in one big PSYCHOACTIVE REALITY
These shows should come to Oklahoma. Or Texas. I&#39;d pay to watch. Live music too. And wine.
gigantic ad
Awesome
the difference between 500 and 100 i think its 400
the future of special affects for ufo in movies and pranks in person.
Fantastic, great work Intel.
we live in the future.... i am glad i was born in the 90s.....
THAT&#39;S AMAZING
awsome!
amazing
Bet those Dubai folks will implement this kind of show soon, especially for their annual new year light show.
Walt Disney World will be doing something like this, this year at Disney Springs
very cool!
congratulations !!!
Wooow! This is awesome! I wonder about the logistics involved - i.e. the software. They must&#39;ve come up with something high-level that simplifies this tremendously. Have some low-level routines constantly and automatically keeping watch on the individual drones status, actual flying controls, collision prevention, etc., - with the high-level stuff basically being &quot;draw this 3-D shape with your fingers on the screen, then draw another one, and all the drones transition from one shape to another&quot;. Or not :) In any case, this is seriously awesome stuff.
Save on fireworks.... better for the environment....? Haha
The difference between 100 and 500 is &#39;x5&#39;. Not &#39;Mindblowing&#39; by any means, unless you&#39;re simple... Thumbs down
So any bets on 1000 drones 1017? That is something I&#39;d love to see.
A great Guinness World Record for Intel
woooooooooooooooooow!!!!!       .-.
how did they controlled that amount of drones. software driven predetermined flight paths?
Nice.
next gen firework
Wow... It&#39;s marvelous...!
Marvelous!
its so incredibly magical and looks like the units from the game Auralux or the small &quot;flies&quot; that the mothership in StarCraft is spreading, so nice .....
круто!!
Imagine the task it would be to charge all 500 after the event lol
MindBlowing !
Look at the very bottom of the screen at exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=120">02:00</a>. During the landing, it looks like 1 of the drones malf&#39;d and flew off into the trees. It moves from the center to the left on a line parallel to the ground, and then disappears into some trees. Still, even with 499 drones, this is damned impressive.
the music in the background?
Amazing just amazing would love to see this. Just a shame they used windows 10 on the laptop controlling all those drones, what could possibly go wrong. bsod in sky that would be mad or the drones mirror the text updating 49% failed reverting changes lol.
What is the music at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=90">1:30</a>
Next time 2,073,600 drones in sky  for 1080 HD  and then 8,294,400 for 4K, 33,177,600 too much?
Can use it on Olympic opening ceremony.. LOL
It&#39;s not blue　＠＠
einfach unbeschreiblich, wie schön der Fortschritt der Menschen und dieser Technologien unser Leben jeden Tag verändern und verbessern können. Gänsehaut .  .   .
mindblowing!!
Мне одному кажется, что это глупое затратное рекламное шоу?
I just want to know how they charge them.
Next time, use 4k.
Just WOW!
OMG !!! . AWESOME !!! . I Love iT !!!
Wow! Next Vegas!

no wonder we have seen a massive spike in UFO sightings.
Prequel for Black Mirror 3x06?
Legit, there&#39;s an asian and an indian involved
Amazing
I wouldn&#39;t want to be the person that has to charge all of those.
I for one welcome our new robot overlords.
Just what we&#39;ve always wanted, ads in the sky in-between &#39;fireworks&#39;.<br>  <br> please stop
Modern firework...
I guess fireworks do still sound a little better than 500 drones...
This is sow awesome!!
Wow.<br><br>This is a amazing.
Cool tech, corny music, corny copy, corny visuals (why online logo), etc, etc... Props to the devs. Now get some artists involved and make it pretty.
not bad not bad but I challenge you with this - find a cure for baldness lol :D
imagine if each one of those had a grenade
woowww
amazing .very impressive!
문과보다 아름다운 이공계를 찬양하라
Absolutely amazing
we need to send these to the sentinel islands so they can play out happy messages for them and teach them we&#39;re their friends.
I can already imagine the military applications of these things... Scary!
reminds me of a hologram
Intel: The Future Begins Here
I had tears in my eyes while watching this. Its truly amazing.
how can it possible?? diffrent orders in same frequency? or separately order at the same time in WiFi or frequency? I dont know the principle... Who can explain to me?
wow its so beutifull
AMAZING...Can&#39;t wait to see what you come up with next....
En centro américa el esfuerzo es constante con arduino los vamos a superar!!
So . . . instead of a show I saw an advertisement.<br>Cute, having no competition Intel releases tepid increments in their processor lines and has time to play with little drones.<br>YO INTEL !   you want BUZZ?   About a 12core under $500?
Stunning
Awesome!<br><br>Who knows what the background music is?
Welcome to the future of advertising. DroneMen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=120">2:00</a> object over the forest?????
cool)
all that talking, and less than ten seconds of flight. Kind of a wasted opportunity.
It is really an amazing light show!  It is very impressive.
Awesome guys :)))
big thanks to intel from all the tech freaks all around<br><br>we all just love it when technology becomes alive and expresses it&#39;s beauty
wooww, now this video will going to break records. Awesome
I want to see someone shoot them all down with an anti-air gun.
Skynet
tecnonauta?
Intel the best
impressive
www.visit dronesup/facebook they post all the news

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOd4-T_p5fA&amp;t=10">0:10</a> Nvidia?
The great thing (or not) is there is one TD thus we&#39;ll be holding our breath waiting for Troll&#39;s Video to go up with 501 Drones.
while I&#39;m sure there was a bit of CGI, wow. Just awesome. Now do 1000
The Swarm
Wow, I liked 😍
Can I buy this drone? how much?
