o0niNWGbTuE,FAKE,Bollywood Actors Are Facing Contract Issue with Big Brands,"Bollywood is not as before now. It has changed a lot, especially after the tragic incident that took place in Bandra on 14th of June. Along with the perception of Bollywood fans, the brands and big marketing companies are viewing Bollywood actors from different eyes, they have never seen from before. This big marketing companies and brands are being pressurized not to choose Bollywood actors as their brand ambassador. And this pressure from the fans is turning out to reality. Seven big brands are set not to renew the contract with the Bollywood actors. Instead, they are set to choose the TV actors as their brand ambassador. According to reports, the company and brands are doing this due to the intense pressure and widespread hatred towards the Nepotism culture in Bollywood.
 
Sushant Singh Rajput's passing became the door for the public to learn about Bollywood dark culture and secrets. Nepotism debate was there, and it existed for a long time, but Sushant's loss made this debate more vital than ever. And Bollywood fans knew about the real face of the Bollywood stars. Even lately, Rhea Chakraborty's drug case is revealing the drug culture in Bollywood.
 
If this goes on, the Bollywood industry is going to bear a huge loss. This would be a perfect lesson for those Bollywood actors, who never use to count on their fans. Recently also we can see that Mahesh Bhatt's Sadak 2 movie, starring Alia Bhatt has to bear a huge loss as well as it got a huge criticism. Along with that, it's trailer video on YouTube became the 2nd most disliked video with 13 Million dislikes.
 
All this was possible due to the fans of Sushant Singh Rajput, who were continually holding this topic for the justice. May the justice will prevail.

Here is a look at 10 popular Bollywood actresses before and after they underwent plastic surgery.
First up is Rakhi Sawant. The former Bollywood item queen and reality TV star went under the knife several times for various procedures that included breast implants, liposuction, and even a nose job. These left her looking like her face is make of plastic. Next is Anushka Sharma. The actress never confirmed reports of going under the knife but pictures soon began to surface of her looking drastically different. This led some to suspect that she had a lip job done. Next is Ayesha Takia. Fans suspect that she had Botox and a lip job that robbed her of her original wholesome features and left her with an ice-cold look. 

Next is Sridevi. The late Bollywood actress was in the limelight for her noticeable nose job that completely altered her physical features. Yet, Sridevi did not let her plastic surgery get the better of her and always conducted herself with a lot of grace. Also on this list is Karishma Kapoor. Inspite of her beauty, this National Award winner too decided to go under the knife to enhance her looks. She is one of the few examples of stars whose looks were actually enhanced by plastic surgery. Koena Mitra became the victim of a botched-up nose job that cost her a fortune in corrective surgery. Yet, unlike most other actresses, Koena has openly spoken about getting surgery done. 

One of Bollywood‚Äôs classic beauties Hema Malini has had Botox injections for years to fight signs of aging. Years of treatment seem to have finally taken a toll on this former heroine. Her face appears so stiff when she speaks that she can no longer smile. Actress Vaani Kapoor‚Äôs face developed sharp angles even as her lips seemed plumper after she allegedly had plastic surgery done before her 2016 film Befikre. She denied all rumours. Former Miss World and currently Mrs Jonas, Priyanka Chopra has had a lot of plastic surgery done to her face over the years including a suspected lip job and nose job. While the actress herself has never confirmed the rumours, many publications have run before and after pictures of the star that show how her facial features have been modified.

KXofTl_kj8U,FAKE,Dark Secrets of Karan Johar | You Never Know,"Unknown secrets of Karan Johar that no one knows :- 

Love affair :- Everyone in Bollywood knows that Karan has an unusual weakness towards male actors and models, and he is gay.  He used to receive many hate mails and comments on his twitter handle for being gay. People call him hypocrite for not admitting that he is a gay.  Rumor is that he was allegedly in a relationship with Bollywood‚Äôs famous fashion designer Manish Malhotra.  Rumor is Karan is now in long-distance relationship with his foreign boyfriend.  From Karan‚Äôs autobiography, we get to know that for many years there were rumors about Karan and Shahrukh Khan's unusual relationship.    Karan also has a particular weakness for Pakistani actor Fawad Khan and he was heartbroken when Fawad got banned from Bollywood. 

Father of Nepotism in bollywood :- Karan Johar is related to two wealthy and influential families in Bollywood.  Aditya Chopra‚Äôs father, Yash Chopra is Karan‚Äôs uncle. Karan‚Äôs father Yash Johar is also a famous producer in Bollywood. Being the son of Yash Johar, Karan grabbed Bollywood's attention quickly since the 90s. Day by day he became the leader  of a big bollywood gang There is no doubt that he is very much obsessed with star kids and A-grade actors and actresses.  In an interview, Karan proudly confessed that he only wants to work with star kids, and that is his personal choice. He doesn‚Äôt care how talented anyone is, he will only launch star kids under his production house. Karan is now getting slammed in all social media because of spreading nepotism in Bollywood.  Kangana even gave him the ultimate tag for promoting nepotism in Bollywood and that is ‚ÄúThe flag bearer of Nepotism‚Äù. Many people troll him for mocking and bullying talented outsiders like Sushant Singh Rajput and Kangana Ranaut.  Karan is now blamed for harassing the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput for ruining his professional life. 

Hatred for Outsider :- Karan hates to work with outsiders, and his manager confessed the truth. Recently, talented actor Ayushamnn Khurrana shared his own pathetic experience to work with Karan Johar . He stated that when he called Karan Johar‚Äôs landline number, his manager picked it up and told that Karan doesn‚Äôt work with outsiders like Ayushmann. Karan only launched some dumb star kids like Alia Bhatt, Ananya Panday etc . Most shockingly, these star kids won best debut male and female awards in the platform ofIIFA and Filmfare. If you are wondering why then here is the answer. In most of these award panels, Karan is one of the influential jury members.  Karan makes sure that only star kids get those awards, not anyone else.  For this reason, Ananya Panday got her debut award in 2020, not a promising outsider like Shivaleeka Oberoi, whose acting is much appreciated among the audience. Karan is now blamed for ruining another immensely talented actor Sushant Singh Rajput broken career.

i1rlytoxQ1o,FAKE,Dark Secrets of Bachchan Family,"Dirty Secrets of the Bachchan Family. Do you know about Shweta Bachchan‚Äôs divorce? Many people may not know, that Shweta Bachchan is now divorced and she stays with her parents permanently. Yes, Shweta has been living separately from her husband Nikhil Nanda for last few years. But Bachchan family has never made this news official as this can affect their public image. Disturbed relationship between mother and daughter. Jaya Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan appear in public together with happy smile but in real life they don‚Äôt share good bonding. Shweta had to get married only at the age of 21 because of her mother but her married life was never been happy. So, Shweta consider her mother responsible for her divorce and unhappy married life. Do you know about the connection between Amitabh Bachchan and B-grade film? In 2003, Amitabh Bachchan did a B-grade film named ‚ÄòBoom‚Äô. Don‚Äôt get shocked as it‚Äôs true. He did the film for money only because he was going through a financial crisis at that time. Now let‚Äôs discuss about the cold war between nanad and bhabi. Shweta Bachchan and Aishwarya don‚Äôt even talk to each other properly and they avoid each other in public also. Actually Shweta is very close to Abhishek‚Äôs ex-girlfriend Karishma and she never accepts Aishwarya as the Bachchan bahu. Do we know about the hatred between Jaya Bachchan  and Aishwarya? Aishawarya was never the first choice to Jaya for Abhishek. Jaya wanted Rani Mukherjee as the perfect Bachchan Bahu.

Side by side, the Jaya Bachchan is always jealous of the extreme popularity of Aishwarya. So, she never became that much close to Aishwarya. There is another dirtiest thing in Bachchan family. This is the worst one. 

According to rumours, Bahu Aishwarya was romantically involved with Amitabh Bachchan. That‚Äôs why everyone in the family hates Aishwarya. We don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs true or just a rumour. Next on the list is Aishwarya‚Äôs downfall of career after marriage. Aishwarya always wanted to come back in bollywood after marriage but she was not able to do that only for Bachchan family. Bachchan family always inspire their daughter to start her career now but they have problem with Aishwarya‚Äôs comeback in bollywood. Now the last one  is Navya Naveli Nanda‚Äôs love affairs and arrogant lifestyle. The granddaughter of Bachchan family already made headlines with her many love affairs. Navya was once dating Shah Rukh‚Äôs son Aryan and the Bachchans were not happy. Then she got engaged with Meezan Jaffrey. She also leads an arrogant lifestyle. Most of the time she gets busy with party, alcohol and vacations with boyfriends

oElP9uf2he4,FAKE,Mr. India 2 | 30 Interesting Facts  | Anil Kapoor | Bonny Kapoor | Kay Kay menon | janhvi Kapoor,"Mr. India is a 1987 Indian Hindi-language superhero film directed by Shekhar Kapur, based on a screenplay written by Salim‚ÄìJaved. It stars Sridevi and Anil Kapoor in the lead roles. Amrish Puri, Ashok Kumar, Satish Kaushik, Ajit Vachani and Sharat Saxena are featured in supporting roles.

The film was the Highest-grossing Indian film of 1987 and remains a cult classic in India.[4] The film was known for several of its lines and songs, including Sridevi's ""Miss Hawa Hawaii"" performance, and Amrish Puri's quote ""Mogambo khush hua"" 

Zee Studios had announced that they have signed Ali Abbas Zafar to helm a trilogy: Mr India, based on the 1987 Shekhar Kapur-directed movie, which featured Anil Kapoor as Mr India and late Sridevi as a journalist. Ever since the announcement of the Mr India reboot has been made official by the makers, Shekhar has been up and about expressing his displeasure over the project. Now, when speculations are rife that Shah Rukh Khan had done a test shoot for the iconic role of Mogambo in Mr India reboot, Shekhar has hit back on Twitter again saying that he does not believe that anyone can take on the iconic role of the villain essayed by late Amrish Puri in the original film.

DqNtfTEaj-Q,FAKE,Shocking Sad News For Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor Marriage,"All Is Not Well Between Alia & Ranbir. One of the most anticipated marriages of this year is the marriage of Alia and Ranbir. But looks like, everything is not well between these love birds. Well recently there were reports doing rounds that Ranbir and Alia will get married after the release of their first movie together Brahmastra. The reports suggested that their family members have already invited their relatives and told them to be free on those dates. It is also said that, both the families have started preparing for the marriage. Reports also said that Alia has already ordered her lehenga to Sabhyasachi. There were also reports suggesting that they have selected their honeymoon destination. But just after few days of these reports coming in limelight, news also started doing round that everything is not well between these two love birds. Both these stars have finished filming for Brahmastra and currently they are busy with their next projects. Alia is currently shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali‚Äôs Gangubai Kathiawadi and Ranbir has started shooting for his next movie Shamshera. It is also said that both these stars are also shooting their respective films at the same film studio but the sets are different. But what is surprising that they are not meeting each other, in spite of being at the same studio. This incident is quite surprising because Alia and Ranbir always accompany each other wherever they go. Even Alia accompanied Ranbir, when he visited his ill father Rishi Kapoor at a hospital of New Delhi. They even attended Armaan Jain‚Äôs wedding together and Alia was many times spotted with Ranbir‚Äôs mother Neetu Kapoor too. But what happened now that they are maintaining distance from each other? There are many questions coming in the limelight right now that if Ranbir has dumped Alia or if Alia cheated on Ranbir. Many people are also thinking that their relationship was just a publicity stunt. They were pretending to be in a relationship just to promote the business of their movie. But nothing has been confirmed now from their side. Many people are also assuming that they are keeping their personal and professional life separate.And by being professional they are not meeting each other on the sets of their movies.We hope that this adorable couple does not part their ways.

dxLJOdr6Xdo,FAKE,Robot 3.0 | 31 Interesting Facts  | Rajinikanth | Disha Patani | Aishwarya | Amy Jackson | S.Shankar,"#RajiniKanth #TigerShroff #Robot3

Director Shankar's dream project 2.0 is all geared up to hit the theatres worldwide on November 29. The sci-fi film is a sequel to the director's Endhiran, which released in 2010. 

The trailer launch of 2.0 took place at a private theatre in Chennai. At the event, host RJ Balaji asked Shankar whether there might be a sequel to 2.0.

The director revealed, ""3.0 might come in future. I have a few fresh ideas for 2.0's sequel. If I am able to pen down a worthy script, then there might be a 3.0 for sure. Let's see.""

Shankar also promised that there are plenty of surprises in 2.0. ""In the film, you will watch Rajinikanth as Vaseegaran, Chitti, 2.0 and even as giant Chitti. There are more surprises in the film,"" he revealed.

2.0 stars Rajinikanth, Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson in the lead roles.2.0, the Rajinikanth movie, as the name suggests is packed with entertainment. Rajinikanth has a mild entrance scene in 2.0 but he more than makes it up with some whistle and clap-worthy sequences. He does what he does best by thoroughly entertaining the audiences. The film rekindles his flamboyant style. Amy Jackson plays a female humanoid robot. Her USP is that she is learning about what modern humans do, especially some funny references to film and TV. Akshay Kumar delivers an ultimate performance as the saviour of his Avian friends.

Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt. Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.

Sanju is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man‚Äôs battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking ‚Äúdid this really happen?‚Äù This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.

Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani.

Soon after ""Rohit Shetty will start work on"" Golmaal 5 ""The shooting of the film will start next year and it is speculated that the film will be released by the end of 2021, but as the circumstances are going on,  Do not think that would be possible.











 So friends, do you think that like the rest of the part, this film will be a hit, be a super hit or will be a blockbuster.

Bahubali 3 Trailer | Prabhas | Anushka Shetty | Pradeep Rawat | SS Rajamouli Releasing Date 2021
Credits: Universal Fox Studios

Actor Prabhas, known for his strong acting in South Industry, has worked in more than one film in his career, but among them ""Bahubal series is considered a successful film of his career"".
Based on the action adventure, 2 parts of this film have been made so far and both the text has been liked by the audience and made them super hit.

The second part of this series came last in the year 2017, after which people started demanding for Bahubali 3 fiercely, but till now Prabhas and the producer of this film did not say anything but friends do you know that your wait is now  It is over because the makers of the Bahubali franchise are going to bring Bahubali 3 soon if news is to be believed.

In our video of today, we are going to give you information about Bahubali 3, which will be the star cast and how long will the film come in ???? If you also want to know all these things related to Bahubali 3, then stay with us till the end of this video and you should not forget to like our video for the superhit film Bahubali series.

The ""Baahubali franchise"" is an important part of Prabhas' career, whose first film ""Baahubali"" came out in the year 2015, in which he played the main role of Shivadu and he had a girlfriend in the lead role with ""Tamannaah Bhatia"" and in the supporting role ""  Many actors like Anushka Shetty "","" Ramya Krishnan ""were seen and Veelaan was in the role of"" Rana Daggubati ""who played Bhallaldev.

The story of this film was liked by the audience so much that the film proved to be a super duper hit and the film had grossed around 650 crores.  In view of this spectacular earning, director SS Rajamouli made the second part of it which was released in the year 2017, which was named ""Bahubali Conclusion"".

In this film, Prabhas Man was in the lead but this time it was in the role of Baahubali, the son of Shivadu's son, this time with whom he was seen as ""Anushka Shetty"" as his girlfriend and mother was his ""Ramya Krishnan"" and Villain.  The role had ""Rana Dagguvati"" as before.

Like the previous time, this film also got a lot of love and the film proved to be a super hit by earning 250 crores. Since this film, the audience started demanding Bahubali 3 and according to the news, according to this growing demand, the film's producer Shobu Yerlagadda and director SS Rajamouli are coming soon with Bahubali 3.

This was revealed when in an interview with journalist Rajeev Masand, Prabhas had said something about the film ""Bahubali 3"" which makes sure that Part 3 of Bahubali is going to be made soon. When Rajiv Masand asked the effect whether Rajamouli would make the third part of Bahubali, Prabhas said that for this he would have to be a little excited. He had already heard me 6 scripts when he was making Bahubali earlier, maybe he has at least  At least 14 to 15 scripts.

By ""Baahubali 2"" we have finished only 60%, I know that the script of ""Baahubali 3"" has been ready in Rajamouli's mind for the last 5 years but I do not know when Rajamouli will start part 3 of Bahubali.  .

Friends, Prabhas is clear from this statement that Rajamouli already has the script of ""Bahubali 3"", but now when he will be released, only Rajamouli can tell it but as far as the first two films of Bahubali are seen, his  The above was also worked in a very secret way, even if no information about these films was available from anywhere, then we doubt if Rajamouli was quietly engaged in preparing for ""Bahubali 3"", and one  Day will suddenly explode that ""Bahubali 3"" is coming to theaters soon!

W9eAjneIs9s,FAKE,Robot 3.0 Trailer | Rajinikanth | Tiger Shroff | Katrina Kaif | Arnold Schwarzenegger,"#RajiniKanth #TigerShroff #Robot3

Director Shankar's dream project 2.0 is all geared up to hit the theatres worldwide on November 29. The sci-fi film is a sequel to the director's Endhiran, which released in 2010. 

The trailer launch of 2.0 took place at a private theatre in Chennai. At the event, host RJ Balaji asked Shankar whether there might be a sequel to 2.0.

The director revealed, ""3.0 might come in future. I have a few fresh ideas for 2.0's sequel. If I am able to pen down a worthy script, then there might be a 3.0 for sure. Let's see.""

Shankar also promised that there are plenty of surprises in 2.0. ""In the film, you will watch Rajinikanth as Vaseegaran, Chitti, 2.0 and even as giant Chitti. There are more surprises in the film,"" he revealed.

2.0 stars Rajinikanth, Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson in the lead roles.2.0, the Rajinikanth movie, as the name suggests is packed with entertainment. Rajinikanth has a mild entrance scene in 2.0 but he more than makes it up with some whistle and clap-worthy sequences. He does what he does best by thoroughly entertaining the audiences. The film rekindles his flamboyant style. Amy Jackson plays a female humanoid robot. Her USP is that she is learning about what modern humans do, especially some funny references to film and TV. Akshay Kumar delivers an ultimate performance as the saviour of his Avian friends.

However, the 3.0 version of Chitti, the robot, is catching the eyes of the audience. These tiny Thalaivar microbots are winning hearts all over, The Indian Express reported.

7cSUaMVq2nM,FAKE,Bollywood Stars Career Destroyed By Karan Johar,"These are the Careers Of Bollywood Stars Destroyed By Karan Johar. Karan Johar is one of the most celebrated directors and producers of the film industry. He has launched many stars in Bollywood but most of them are star kids. So, he is given the title of ‚Äòflag bearer of nepotism‚Äô. Because of his fondness towards star kids only, Karan has tried to destroy the career of many Bollywood stars who are quite successful now.

1. Anushka Sharma :- Karan Johar himself admitted during a press conference with Rajeev Masand that KJo tried hard to sabotage Anushka‚Äôs career. Karan never wanted Aditya Chopra to cast Anushka Sharma in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. When Aditya showed him Anushka‚Äôs image, KJo rejected her. Karan hated Anushka‚Äôs look and hesitantly watched Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi but later he casted her in her movie Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.

2. Sushant Singh Rajput :- One of the extremely talented actors of Bollywood, Sushant Singh Rajput ‚Äòs career was also manipulated by Karan Johar. Because of Sushant‚Äôs fall out with a producer, many big production houses of Bollywood, including Karan Johar banned him. Which is why the actor lost all the projects in his hand and was left with no work; and he decided to take his own life.

3. Ayushmann Khurrana :- One of the most sought after actor of Bollywood. Ayushmann Khurrana was once neglected and rejected by Karan Johar. Ayushmann himself confessed that when he was hosting a show, he asked Karan for work. Karan gave him a landline number. When he called, a staff of Dharma Production said that they only work with stars and he would not get work there.

4. Priyanka Chopra :- Priyanka is a global icon now but there was a time when Karan Johar tried to ban Priyanka Chopra from Bollywood. Everybody knows about the Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs affair with Priyanka Chopra which created a lot buzz in B Town. Gauri along with her friends from industry with help of Karan Johar decided to ban Priyanka in Bollywood but ultimately failed.

5. Kangana Ranaut :- Kangana is one of the most out spoken actresses in Bollywood and she has always blamed Karan for nepotism in industry. Kangana humiliated Karan Johar for showing attitude towards her and for nepotism, on Karan‚Äôs own talk show. Karan tried really hard to sabotage the shining career of Kangana Ranaut, but he failed to end the career of the ‚Äòqueen‚Äô.

WErNBLqdLrY,FAKE,Secret Divorce Reason of Imran Khan and Avantika,"The Reason of Imraan and Avantika‚Äôs Divorce. Reports of Imran Khan and Avantika Malik separation have hit the bollywood for several months and rumor of their divorce already made headlines. Due to growing differences between them, Avantika left the house with her daughter and staying with her parents. Both of them never answered the question being asked about their separation and their silence says it all. But why this cute married couple has got divorced? Everyone is curious to know the reason of their separation and finally the reason is there in the news. Imran and Avantika married to each other in a fairytale wedding ceremony and they have a cute daughter Imaara. But the Imran‚Äôs failed career is one of the major reasons of the daily fight between this loved couple. The issue came into limelight when Avantika removed her surname ‚ÄúKhan‚Äù from his name . Imran Khan is unable to establish himself in bollywood and it‚Äôs been more than four years he is sitting at home with no job. His last movie ""Katti Batti"" didn‚Äôt get much audience attention and was flop. He is getting no film offers since his last film. Avantika‚Äôs mother also accepted the differences between the couple but she dismissed the fact that they are getting divorced. Report says that Imran wants to be a film director but the things did not go well and he end up with no film to direct. According to report, the savings of Imran came to an end and Avantika has to rely on her parents‚Äô money for their expenses. Because of failed career and lack of money, Imran turned short tempered resulting in quarrel among the two.For that reason their house has become place of regular arguments which ended up after separation. Earlier we saw many bollywood divorces because of failed career and financial issues. Maliaka Arora got separated from Arbaaz Khan because of his flop bollywood career and financial crisis. According to report, Avantika has joined wellness clinic to cope of with her separation, which proves she is dealing with a tough time. Avantika who was always a strong supporter of Imran, now ended up with separation because of his Imran‚Äôs flop career. Imran started his career with a hit film ‚ÄúJaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na‚Äù and got lot of appreciation for his acting skill. After that he got plenty of film offers to prove himself but every time he failed to impress the audiences. All the filmmakers stopped working with him and Imran is also not ready to do any supporting role. Now, we will wait and watch wheather this couple will get back together or they completely call their marriage off.

h2mecvSfT8w,FAKE,Why Salman Khan Hate Amitabh Bachchan So Much,"Does the bhaijaan of Bollywood hate the veteran actor of Bollywood, Big B?Why this question? Because Salman Khan does not like to get compared with the veteran actor. The current reports are suggesting that Salman Khan gets very angry when someone compares him the bhaijaan. What had happened that Salman Khan gets angry whenever someone compares him Big B? Salman Khan‚Äôs style is very unique and no other star has the same kind of swag in this industry. His swag stands out from each and every other stars present in the B town which is why he cannot get compared with anyone. But when it comes to stardom, the Khans of Bollywood, has reached the extent when they can easily get compared with veteran actors. When Salman Khan was giving auditions for Sooraj Barjatiya‚Äôs Maine Pyaar Kiya, he did a small role in Biwi Ho Toh Aisi. When the first cut of the movie got ready, a member from the crew of Biwi Ho Toh Aisi told Salman Khan that he looked like Big B. Yes, Salman Khan received such a huge compliment during his initial days in the industry. Any other actor would have been overwhelmed with joy after that compliment, but not Salman Khan. Salman Khan was very much angry when he received such a compliment. The actor folded his hands and requested the crew member not to compare him with Mr, Amitabh Bachchan. But why did Salman Khan give such a reaction? Does he hate the veteran actor?Well, before any speculations, let us explain the real reason behind such a reaction of Salman Khan. At that time a compliment like getting compared with Amitabh Bachchan meant a lot but it was a huge responsibility too. People applauded many actors for their style like Amitabh Bachchan but when the same actor failed to act like Big B, their career got ruined. And Salman Khan did not want his career to get ruined at the very initial stage, which is why he hated to get compared with Big B. Salman Khan is ready to get called the competitor of any other star but he hates being compared with Salman Khan.

But what is most heart breaking to listen is that, the Laughter Queen of India, Bharti Singh, is an unwanted child. Yes, Bharti was not wanted by her family, because they were very poor back then. Bharti Singh, in one of her old reviews, revealed that when her mother was carrying her in her womb, they did not want her. Bharti revealed that his mother wanted to abort her third baby who was Bharti. Bharti Singh‚Äôs mother, Kamla Singh tried various means to abort Bharti, but she failed. When Bharti appeared on the Rajeev Khandelwal‚Äôs chat show, Juzz Baat, she revealed some gruesome details about her childhood. Bharti said that Her family was very poor back then, and it was hard for them to raise three kids. Which is why, her parents do not want a third kid and when her mother got pregnant with her, she wanted to abort. She tried many ways to abort Bharti but failed to succeed and later she changed her mind, and decided to keep her. Bharti also revealed that, after Bharti was born, her mother never let her feel that she was unwanted. Kamla Singh loved her third child, Bharti, just like she loved her other two kids.

From that moment onwards, there was no turning back for this beauty. Regarded as the ‚Äúmost beautiful woman in the world‚Äù, Aishwarya became the queen of hearts within just a few years. 

She started her career as an actor in 1997 with Mani Ratnam‚Äôs Iruvar and did her first Hindi film, Aur Pyar Ho Gaya the same year.

Paired opposite superstars Salman Khan and Ajay Devgn, Aishwarya‚Äôs character Nandini struck several chords with the women of the time. She was naive yet fierce, strong but bound by the constitution of marriage, Aishwarya won her first Filmfare Award for her accurate portrayal of a woman in love. 

Her femininity and grace is known all over the globe. She‚Äôs an epitome of beauty and transcends her elegance even on screen. Taking the screen once again in a big way as Paro from Devdas in 2002, Aishwarya proved that her beauty maybe be paramount but her talent is exponentially bigger. She was awarded the Black Lady for her act in Bhansali‚Äôs drama yet again for her iconic role Paro. 

Aishwarya went on to do some brilliant roles thereafter. Films like Raincoat, Jodha Akbar and Raavan were some class acts by the superstar. But ruling over just Bollywood wasn‚Äôt enough for her. Aishwarya aced her act in several Hollywood films like Pink Panther 2, The Last Legion, and Mistress of Spices. 

Married to the junior Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is now one of the biggest names in not just in the film industries but also the fashion world across the globe. A larger-than-life career, global domination and the most loved family woman, Aishwarya is an inspiration for all.

Dhakka Laga Bukka Lyrics :

Aankhon mein angaar hai, angaar hai.
Aur saanson mein toofan hai, toofan hai.
Mitti ki hum moorat hai par, hausle aasmaan hai.

There‚Äôs fire in our eyes
And a storm in our breaths
Men of this soil, we‚Äôll fight to our deaths

Kalyug mein chaadar safed oadhe, jab jab Raavan aayega.
Jab jab jab Raavan aayega.
Har Yuva mein Ram samayega.

Hidden in plain sight, when the devil takes the crown

Lehrein uthi hai, shor macha hai.
Josh sa koi, hum mein utha hai.
Hum hain sailaabi.

There‚Äôs a wave, there‚Äôs uproar
There‚Äôs fire in our belly and rage in our soul
We‚Äôre a Tsunami

Doobi doobi si tumhe jaise hoti chamakti moti hai, moti jyoti hai.
Kirdaar aise hi dil mein saje hain humare.

Like shining pearls seeded deep at the ocean‚Äôs heart
These characters shine brightly in our hearts

Apne usool hai, apni samajh.
Duniya ko apni nigahon se parakh.
Sach aur jhooth ka farak samajh.
Zulm ko de de zameen pe patak.

Have your principles, have your own mind
Perceive the world through your eye
Accept the truth, recognize the lie
Protect the world from the devil‚Äôs evil eye

O Yuva. (x7)

Welcome to the World of Gulabo Sitabo where two slimy scheming foxes in a game of one upmanship, each one attracting other members to their clan and each one with an agenda of his own.

Meet ‚ÄòMirza‚Äô(Amitabh Bachchan) ‚Äì a 78yrs old landlord, who would move heaven and earth for his most priced possession ‚Äì an old Dilapidated Mansion in the heart of Lucknow

But this garden of roses comes with its own cluster of ‚Äòpricky thorns‚Äô ‚Äì tenants. Amongst them most prominently, ‚ÄòBaankey‚Äô (Ayushmann Khuranna)‚Äô a shrewd, sly and squatted tenant, who matches Mirza bit for bit in their ceaseless bantering.

Gulabo Sitabo, the dramedy, premieres on June 12, exclusively on Amazon Prime Video.

Chhalaang stars Rajkummar Rao & Nushrratt Bharuccha. The film is written by Luv Ranjan, Aseem Arrora & Zeishan Quadri, it is directed by Hansal Mehta, produced by Ajay Devgn, Luv Ranjan & Ankur Garg, and presented by Bhushan Kumar. 
Chhalaang is slated to release on Amazon Prime Video, this Diwali, Nov 13. 
Chhalaang is a hilarious, yet inspirational journey of a PT Master from a semi government funded school in Northern India. Montu (Rajkummar Rao) is a typical PT Master for whom it‚Äôs just a job. When circumstances put everything that Montu cares for at stake, including Neelu (Nushrratt Bharuccha) who he loves, Montu is forced to do what he has never done - Teach. Through Montu‚Äôs journey, Chhalaang humorously addresses the value of Sports Education in the school curriculum.

Synopsis:
The film follows the escape of two people belonging to two different worlds within our society and the circumstances that brings them together.

Sandy Walia short for Sandeep Kaur Walia (Parineeti Chopra) is a 30 year old single, pregnant, senior banker working in a growing private sector bank now wanting to resign. Post her resignation, Sandeep and her boss decide to meet for a final 'goodbye' dinner at a high class lounge in Delhi. After waiting for a significant time, Sandy decides to leave with an old acquaintance for another party when she is secretly hauled by Pinky (Arjun Kapoor), short for Satinder Dahiya a 35 year old, divorced, suspended police officer who works with the Special Unit cell of the Delhi Police, into a car and driven off into the deserted roads of Gurgaon.

While the two drive away from the main city of Delhi, Pinky seems tense and is continuously talking to his boss over the phone who gives him directions to a barricade point. Amidst all the confusion, Pinky's intuition kicks in and he decides to give wrong information as a result of which both Sandy and Pinky watch a false car being attacked in front of their eyes, killing everyone inside.

From this moment onwards, Sandy and Pinky realise that they are marked for a kill and have to run to be alive. A deal is cracked between the two where they plan to cross the Indian border and escape to Nepal post which the two would go their own way.

Throughout their journey together, while they are continuously being chased by the 'big people' who want them dead, Sandy and Pinky reveal themselves in ways that affect each other and make them reflect on their lives in the past. The people they meet on this journey, both influence and are influenced by them. They bring them to a final internal realisation on what 'escaping' or 'freedom' actually means to them.

Synopsis:
India‚Äôs top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the cr√®me de la cr√®me of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra‚Äôs key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country.

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir‚Äôs team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid‚Äôs intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir‚Äôs greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country‚Äôs enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid.

But Khalid‚Äôs greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero‚Äôs head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists - he is the best prot√©g√© and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question - why did he turn rogue?

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as prot√©g√© goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

Synopsis:
A 21-year old boy named Sunny (Vishal Jethwa), comes to the city on a murder contract given to him by the city‚Äôs strongest political player. Sunny looks like any other innocent 21-year old, but there‚Äôs more to him. He has a penchant for sexually assaulting and eventually murdering young girls. While at it, he locks horns with Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukerji), the newly appointed chief of the city police. Sunny‚Äôs fascinated by her persona. That‚Äôs when we come to know that he has a thing for strong, independent women. Shivani persists and manages to get a witness who can identify Sunny. But he manages to eliminate the witness, that too from right under Shivani's nose. This creates unrest in the city and leads to the transfer of Shivani from her position. But before her transfer could come into force, with her small team, she decides to take on Sunny and nab him within 48 hours. 

Bit by bit, Shivani tracks Sunny‚Äôs hideout. In one particularly nerve-wracking pursuit, Shivani chases him down but he jumps into the Chambal river. An injured Shivani tries to catch him, but he escapes. From here begins a thrilling cat and mouse hunt between them. Sunny is all set with an escape plan out of the city as well. His plan includes abducting a female social worker who‚Äôs about to stand for the next election and using her to negotiate his way out. Meanwhile, Shivani is hounded by the media, led by the well-known reporter Amit Sharma about her role in instigating the serial killer to go a killing spree in city. On one hand the partial media and on the other hand... only a few hours left to hunt a serial killer who‚Äôs out to target more women. Will Shivani manage to nab Sunny, or does she too turn into one of his victims?

Synopsis:
A 21-year old boy named Sunny (Vishal Jethwa), comes to the city on a murder contract given to him by the city‚Äôs strongest political player. Sunny looks like any other innocent 21-year old, but there‚Äôs more to him. He has a penchant for sexually assaulting and eventually murdering young girls. While at it, he locks horns with Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukerji), the newly appointed chief of the city police. Sunny‚Äôs fascinated by her persona. That‚Äôs when we come to know that he has a thing for strong, independent women. Shivani persists and manages to get a witness who can identify Sunny. But he manages to eliminate the witness, that too from right under Shivani's nose. This creates unrest in the city and leads to the transfer of Shivani from her position. But before her transfer could come into force, with her small team, she decides to take on Sunny and nab him within 48 hours. 

Bit by bit, Shivani tracks Sunny‚Äôs hideout. In one particularly nerve-wracking pursuit, Shivani chases him down but he jumps into the Chambal river. An injured Shivani tries to catch him, but he escapes. From here begins a thrilling cat and mouse hunt between them. Sunny is all set with an escape plan out of the city as well. His plan includes abducting a female social worker who‚Äôs about to stand for the next election and using her to negotiate his way out. Meanwhile, Shivani is hounded by the media, led by the well-known reporter Amit Sharma about her role in instigating the serial killer to go a killing spree in city. On one hand the partial media and on the other hand... only a few hours left to hunt a serial killer who‚Äôs out to target more women. Will Shivani manage to nab Sunny, or does she too turn into one of his victims?

Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists ‚Äì he is the best prot√©g√© and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question ‚Äì why did he turn rogue?

Synopsis:
When they ran to save their lives for the first time, they were mere 12-year-old boys, and the world called them 'refugees'.

The war of 1971 gave birth to a new country - Bangladesh. It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram and Bala. They witnessed the war and its aftermath, where the world tried to trample over them. Fighting for survival, they clung to each other and escaped to Calcutta.

Before they knew the world, they knew each other. Such was their bond, such was their friendship.

Each time they sought new beginnings, each time they would rise, the world would crush them down. So, they fought again... and again. Together they were unbeatable. They were unstoppable. They were inseparable.

In the years that passed, Bikram and Bala, became Calcutta's most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless and most powerful GUNDAY!

They had everything... then, one fine day, bells rang...

Nandita, the most beautiful cabaret dancer, walked into their lives, and they lost everything to her. Their murky world turned magical and colourful. They fell head over heels in love with her.

But that was only a blissful lull before an impending storm...

And then entered ACP Satyajeet Sarkar, the right for every wrong, a law for every outlaw and a counter force for Bikram and Bala.

What follows from here is the most sensational-most thrilling-most dramatic story ever told!

BHWrsTWR0xA,REAL,Deepika Padukone Interview With Anupama Chopra | Padmaavat | Film Companion,"The success of Padmaavat makes Deepika Padukone one of the most powerful women in Bollywood. Rarely has a film of this scale been centred on a female protagonist. In this interview, Deepika talks about how she can use her success positively and why she's looking to do something fun and light now. While she's searches for a script that interests her, she tells us about how she's spending her free time at home. She also talks about speculations on her marriage and why she can now imagine herself being a working wife or mother.

w4rlMwZjiLQ,REAL,Films Can Bring Change Ft. Shah Rukh Khan | Anupama Chopra | Film Companion,"In our third conversation in just as many months, Shah Rukh Khan talks to Anupama Chopra about Raees, the ambiguous morality of portraying a negative character on screen and the pressures of expectation that being a star entails. As always, he speaks candidly- about feeling that he let Fan director Maneesh Sharma down, about missing the rawness that is afforded when an actor is just starting out and his reluctant acceptance that no matter his actual involvement in a film, he becomes the assumed leader of the pack.

Synopsis:
Have you ever stopped to think if the most ordinary, uninteresting, unobtrusive man you might see on the road or around you might have a love story to tell? Maybe not! How can an ordinary man have a breathtaking, goose flesh igniting, awe inspiring love story of all things to tell?

This is what happened to Surinder Sahni (Shah Rukh Khan) - a simple, clean hearted, honest man, leading a humdrum life, when he meets his total opposite and finds love in the flamboyant, fun-loving, vivacious - Taani (Anushka Sharma) for whom the whole world is her canvas and she paints her own life with the colours of rainbow all until unforeseen circumstances changes it all and brings them together.

What follows is a journey filled with laughter, tears, joy, pain, music, dance and a lot of love. A journey that makes us believe that there is an extraordinary love story in every ordinary jodi (couple).

Tere rang aisa chadh gaya
Koi aur rang na chadh sake
Tera naam seeney pe likha
Har koi aake padh sakey

Hai junoon hai junoon hai
Tere ishq ka ye junoon hai
Rag rag mein ishq tera daudta
Yeh bawra sa khoon hai
Tune hi sikhaya sachai oo ka matlab
Tere paas aake jaana maine zindagi ka maksad
Satyamev, satyamev, satyamev jayate
Sacha hai pyaar tera, satyamev jayate

Tere noor ke dastoor mein
Na ho salwatein na shikan rahe
Meri koshishein toh hai bas yaheen
Rahein khushbooein gulshan rahe
Teri zulf suljhaney chala
Terey aur paas aaney chala
Jahan koi sur na ho besura
Woh geet main ganey chala

Tere rang aisa chadh gaya
Tha nasha jo aur bhi badh gaya
Teri barishon ka karam hai ye
Main nikhar Gaya main sanwar gaya
Jaisa bhi hoon apna mujhey
Mujhey ye nahin hain bolna
Kabil tere main ban sakoo
Mujhey dwaar aisa kholna
Sanson ki iss raftaar ko
Dhadkan ke iss tyohaar ko
Har jeet ko har haar ko
Khud apney iss sansaar ko
Badloonga main tere liye

Mujhey khud ko bhi hai tatolna
Kahin hai kami to hai bolna
Khahin dag hain toh chupayein kyon
Hum sach se nazrein hatayein kyon
khud ko badalna hai agar
Badloonga main tere liye
Sholon pe chalna hai agar
Chal doonga main tere liye
Mere khoon kee har boond main
Sankalp ho tere pyaar ka
Kato mujhey to too bahe
Ho surkh rang har dharrrr ka",170990,9818,18659980

  Rekha is a friend. She had watched each and every Rendezvous and told me how much she loved them. For several years I invited her to have a rendezvous with me, she would always reply, ""I don't have the self-confidence.""  
  The time came for my 100th Rendezvous episode. I wanted a' special guest' for this landmark show, so I asked her once again. This time she agreed - and it really was 'special'...
  I've known Rekha for a long time. I find her absorbing - and very entertaining too. She is a great mimic! 
  We have endless phone talks - always about four hours! And each time she surprises me with new facets in her to love. Rekha is 
immensely wise and astute. Acutely observant. Has an elephantine memory. She is also the least self-obsessed star I know; some one who never harbours a mean thought or word. Rekha loves generously. 
  In my rendezvous -- I took her back in her journey from Bhanurekha, the child; through her stormy adolescence.. her stardom.. her loves...marriages.. covering, in fact, Rekha's entire evolution.
  It's a panoramic canvas of one of the most legendary stars of our time -- and also  - an intimate portrait of a woman.
  Don't miss it....Watch the other two parts as well!

GJ7yJnJIvdY,REAL,Rendezvous with Simi Garewal - Sushmita Sen & Renee,"Sushmita Sen is someone I invited for a second time. The first was with Vikram Bhatt in 1997; the next time, she came with her daughter Ren√©e. 
I found Sush fascinating! Here is a woman who lives completely on her terms. We are all victims of our gender, of society, of people‚Äôs opinions. They tie us down, they suppress us, but they don't suppress Sush. She is without hypocrisy. She is unafraid.  
How many single women would adopt a child at 24 - knowing it could complicate your life and relationships enormously? And now she‚Äôs adopted another girl! The moments between her and her Ren√©e were pure magic. One of my favourite shows...

KTjrTSd2TkI,REAL,Rendezvous with Simi Garewal Amitabh Bachchan & Family Part 1,"THE BACHCHANS  2004
  Five years had passed since my first rendezvous with Amit-ji. He had come through a lot, health, finance and career problems. But now he was back, bigger than ever before...a legend.
  No one can claim to 'know' Amitabh. So I had to meet him with the persons he is closest to in the world -- his family.
 They arrived through the studio gates in a stately convoy of luxury make-up vans and Mercedes SL 500s. The women dressed in brocades and rubies; the men in their classic 
designer suits and ties. It was the Bachchans, Amitabh, Jaya, Shweta and Abhishek, keeping their 'Rendezvous with Simi Garewal'. 
  I loved the camaraderie, the in-house jokes, the teasing, which only a family can get away with! I also sensed the unstated alliances. Amit-ji and Shweta were a team! Jaya-ji and Abhishek. And yet, they were a unit of one.    
 Without doubt, India has a continuing love-affair with Amitabh Bachchan. They've seen him in hundreds of films in hundreds of roles..but here they'll see him in his essence -- as the family man.

They were husband and wife. 
This rendezvous captures the story of their budding romance and marriage.
It captures the young Saif, witty, carefree and fun...

Two children later Amrita and Saif divorced.

She had recently started her journey in Bollywood.There is a freshness and charm that surprisingly remains, even today. Through the years we have become friends. She is natural and unpretentious and sensitive. I have seen so much warmth and affection from her.  It is always sheer delight to sit opposite the exquisite and ethereal Aishwarya Rai.

I asked Karan to bring his 'best friend' for our Rendezvous. He brought Kajol. 
They were a RIOT! I don't think I've laughed so much on any show! And neither has Kajol!! Especially in the Quick Fire round -- which evoked hilarious answers! 
Karan is always cool in an interview -- but I've never seen Kajol so bindaas on any other show!

In the 60th edition of the Filmfare Awards, we saw a stunning performance by Varun Dhawan and caught Alia Bhatt match tunes with host Kapil Sharma in a hilarious segment with our host, Karan Johar. Joining Karan on stage for the first time was Arjun Kapoor who entertained the audience with his impeccable comic timing on stage. It was also the year we saw Salman Khan and Deepika Padukone share the stage and shake a leg to a chartbuster and spread a laughter riot across the venue. 

Mixing it up with the entertainment quotient, Shahid Kapoor for Haider and Kangana Ranaut for Queen were the big winners of the night as they swept the popular choice awards for their performances that year. Queen also took the trophy for the Best Film that year.


Taking you back in time yet again, we bring to you the 60th Filmfare Awards that saw some very cherished moments unfold on stage. All the charisma, magic and music, right here for you. Watch the full show right here.

Synopsis:
Choices... to choose between right or wrong is simple, but what defines one's life is the decision between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils. This is the advice that Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol) receives from her father just as she is about to venture out into the world of her own for the very first time. Little does she know that these very words will shape her life.

Zooni, a blind Kashmiri girl, meets Rehan Qadri (Aamir Khan), a local Delhi tour guide and an incorrigible flirt. Her friends warn her against this good-for-nothing roadside Romeo, but she chooses to ignore them. It is now her time to discover life and love. Is this really the right choice?

Rehan is fascinated by Zooni and wants her to see life as it should be seen, in its many colours. He promises her that the time spent with him will be the most precious in all her life. Zooni sees Delhi, life and love like she never has before, because of Rehan.

What Zooni doesn't know is that Rehan has another side of his life that he has kept from her - something that can not only change her life, but can also destroy it.

Synopsis:
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) is a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force. In the line of duty he comes across a stranded Zaara (Preity Zinta)... a girl from Pakistan who has come to India to fulfill her surrogate mothers dying wish. Veer saves her life and his life is never the same again.

Twenty two years later Saamia Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), a Pakistani human rights lawyer on her first case, finds herself face to face with an aging Veer Pratap Singh. He has languished in a Pakistan jail cell for 22 years and has not spoken to anyone all these years. And no one knows why. Her mission is to discover the truth about Veer and see to it that justice is served.

VEER-ZAARA is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation & deepens with sacrifice. A love that is an inspiration... and will remain a legend forever.

Synopsis:
India‚Äôs top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the cr√®me de la cr√®me of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra‚Äôs key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country. 

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir‚Äôs team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid‚Äôs intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir‚Äôs greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country‚Äôs enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid. 

But Khalid‚Äôs greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.  

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero‚Äôs head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists ‚Äì he is the best prot√©g√© and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question ‚Äì why did he turn rogue? 

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as prot√©g√© goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

Synopsis:
Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) knows what it's like to come back from the dead. The ex Indian Captain has now come back in the avatar of the Coach of the Indian Women's National Hockey team. A team that exists more on paper and less in reality.

The team is a rag-tag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick, keeping their eyes on the ball and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team? To play for India?

The girls have never known the thrilling energy of being Team India. Of giving their all to see their country's name on a trophy. But Kabir Khan, once a captain, now forgotten, does. He knows what it takes to get there. And what it means to return empty handed. This time, he wants to make sure that it's different. He knows there are no second chances. Despite his past, he believes that if only the girls played as one, anything would be possible.

Because Kabir Khan believes that it is not that we can't win. It's just that we have never believed we can.

CHAK DE INDIA is the story of a coach's fight of making his team, Team India by overcoming their diverse backgrounds, by learning to use everything that life hurls on them as a secret weapon. It's a story about honesty, sincerity and integrity. The Film became a cult classic and won its leading man the National Award and put the Indian National Sport ""Hockey"", back on the map.

Synopsis:
Fed up with the lack of critical appreciation despite being a successful writer, Abhimanyu Roy (Ayushmann Khurrana) returns to his roots in Kolkata to write more meaningful literature and decides on an old-fashioned love story - which was now, 3 years in the making.

This writers block is called Bindu (Parineeti Chopra). How do you contain this unpredictable, crazy, restless, larger than life, live wire in the pages of a book?

As Abhi says ‚Äò‚ÄòYou know when a song comes on and you just have to dance? Bindu was that song. That silly infectious joyful tune you couldn‚Äôt get out of your head‚Ä¶ even if you wanted to.‚Äù

So where should he begin? Where should he end?

But when Abhi stumbles across an old audio cassette of their favourite playlist, it sends Abhi down memory lane‚Ä¶ and as he waltzes in and out of his past and present through the songs in the mixed tape, he finally faces reality and reconnects with his roots, with his family and his novel starts writing itself.

Of course, life in its usual scheming manner surprises him yet again and changes the ending of his book and his life, as he once again finds himself being pulled back into the center of that crazy little thing called love.

He realizes, that love, is neither time- nor place-dependent‚Ä¶.
All we need is the right person next to us and of course the right soundtrack.

It is the 1990s, the tape-cassette is dying, CDs will soon be the rage and a regular arranged marriage will turn out to be a perfect mismatch. Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a shy music buff who runs a tape recording shop in Haridwar. Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) likes to dance to the band tunes at her own wedding. He has nightmares about drawing a blank at his English exam. She is about to carve a niche for herself as a teacher.

But now, they are married and they are supposed to spend a lifetime together - and he is still trying to find balance on their scooter ride together.

Synopsis:
""Sui Dhaaga - Made in India"" is a heartwarming story of pride and self reliance, which finds its roots in the heart of India and reflects the passion that runs through the veins of every single Indian. Taking the message of ""Made in India"" forward, the film modestly tries to bring back our traditional art forms and handicrafts in focus. The film is helmed by National award winning Producer - Director Duo of Maneesh Sharma and Sharat Katariya (Dum Laga ke Haisha) and features Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma in the lead roles.

Through the hero & his wife, film talks about the need of social entrepreneurship as a tool for social and economic development of our artisans, living their life in the margins due to the changing times. Set in a small town in India, the film encapsulates the journey of an honest man from a humble background, who pursues his passion, overcoming all odds and soon finds himself on the cover of an international magazine with the world taking note and appreciating his talent.

A clean family entertainer, the film emphasizes virtues like honesty, self respect and community living.

Manto the film follows the most tumultuous four years in the life of Manto and that of the two countries he inhabits ‚Äì India and Pakistan. In Bombay‚Äôs seedy-shiny film world, Manto and his stories are widely read and accepted. But as sectarian violence engulfs the nation, Manto makes the difficult choice of leaving his beloved Bombay. In Lahore, he finds himself bereft of friends and unable to find takers for his writings. His increasing alcoholism leads him into a downward spiral. Through all of this, he continues to write prolifically, without dilution. This is the tale of two emerging nations, two faltering cities, and one man who tries to make sense of it all.

Synopsis:
Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) knows what it's like to come back from the dead. The ex Indian Captain has now come back in the avatar of the Coach of the Indian Women's National Hockey team. A team that exists more on paper and less in reality.

The team is a rag-tag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick, keeping their eyes on the ball and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team? To play for India?

The girls have never known the thrilling energy of being Team India. Of giving their all to see their country's name on a trophy. But Kabir Khan, once a captain, now forgotten, does. He knows what it takes to get there. And what it means to return empty handed. This time, he wants to make sure that it's different. He knows there are no second chances. Despite his past, he believes that if only the girls played as one, anything would be possible.

Because Kabir Khan believes that it is not that we can't win. It's just that we have never believed we can.

CHAK DE INDIA is the story of a coach's fight of making his team, Team India by overcoming their diverse backgrounds, by learning to use everything that life hurls on them as a secret weapon. It's a story about honesty, sincerity and integrity. The Film became a cult classic and won its leading man the National Award and put the Indian National Sport ""Hockey"", back on the map.

mTNgH_5xYh0,REAL,Candid Conversation with Sara Ali Khan | Sara Ali Khan Interview | Famously Filmfare S2,"She's the newest diva on the block. She's bubbly, funny, witty and oh, so beautiful. Yes, we're talking about Sara Ali Khan. She's already a movie wonder and a mass favourite with just two films out. Here gravitating performance in Kedarnath caught millions eye balls and her charisma in Simmba made her the rising star of 2019. 

With just that and the impeccable family backing in the form of Saif Ali Khan, Amrita Singh and Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sara Ali Khan has proven that she's here for the long haul. 

Though a sensation already, she has a long way to go and this chirpy newcomer has a lot in store for the audiences. Unfiltered, unabashed and limitless, Sara Ali Khan is the chatterbox gracing the hot seat on the second season of Famously Filmfare. 

Spilling the beans on what makes her the coolest youngster in B-town, here are the highlights of Sara Ali Khan's interview with editor Jitesh Pillaai on Famously Filmfare S2.

Actor Rajkummar Rao, who is known for his phenomenal performances, said he doesn't feel any external pressure due to the expectations people have from him as he ""loves to explore"" his characters.

Asked how is his approach towards characters in these films, he said: ""It depends on the script, the character and how much it demands from me. Like 'Trapped' is a serious film with a demanding script whereas 'Behen Hogi Teri' is a fun film. Once you are done, it is easy to come out from the character of a fun film.""

About his favourite genre of the two, the 32-year-old said: ""I really can't say. Both are equally exciting. As an actor, I love pushing myself.""

Asked how he feels when people await for a good film from him, he said: ""I think this is a big compliment for me that people can vouch for a good film from me. It's a great position to be in.""

About mainstream cinema, the 'Shahid' actor said that commercial cinema is going through a changing phase. ""All superstars are doing films like 'Dangal', 'Raees', 'Sultan'. It is a wonderful change and the whole definition of commercial cinema has transformed.""

In his forthcoming film 'Trapped', Rajkummar plays a man who is trapped in his own house at a high-rise building with no escape. Produced by Phantom Films and directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, it is set to release on March 17.

2aIhbJAFDCQ,REAL,Deepika Padukone Interview | All About Women With Deepika Padukone & Laxmi Agarwal | Femina Upclose,"There‚Äôs no perfect way to describe the energy, positivity and comfort in the air when Deepika Padukone and Laxmi Agarwal are together in a room. They are poles apart yet when they stand together representing strength, grace and the power of sisterhood, it‚Äôs difficult to keep your attention away from them. After a super-fun photoshoot session with the duo for our latest cover, we sat down with Deepika and Laxmi to hear from about their journey together for Chhhapaak‚Äîthe Meghna Gulzar directorial, which is based on the acid attack on Laxmi and her life after the incident; Deepika brings alive Laxmi‚Äôs character with integrity and poise as Malti. Watch this interview to know how women need to stand for women, acid survivors, and more. 
Deepika Padukone and Vikrant Massey starrer Chhapaak is out on theatres. The film, directed by Meghna Gulzar, is based on acid attack survivor, Laxmi Agarwal‚Äôs story, and chronicles the journey of Malti, and her determination to achieve victorious in the face of adversity. Chhapaak is also Padukone‚Äôs debut venture as a producer. 
We spoke to Padukone and Agarwal about society‚Äôs outlook towards survivors, beauty and the sale of acid.
Chhapaak chronicles Malti‚Äôs (the protagonist) journey. How would you define her spirit?
Deepika: If she (pointing towards Laxmi) is not an inspiration, I don‚Äôt know who is! We make movies on various topics, but it was important to shed light on a subject like acid attacks in India, considering we don‚Äôt know as much as we should. When Meghna (Gulzar) offered me the project, it talked about acid attacks, but it laid more emphasis on Malti‚Äôs spirit, grit, determination, sense of humour, intelligence, and confidence. According to me, the honesty with which Laxmi speaks is the most beautiful aspect of her personality.
Society is known to blame and shame the survivor rather than the culprit. Has society progressed from that thought process over the decades?
Laxmi: When I stepped out for the first time post my attack in 2005, girls/women ridiculed me the most. They would ask me to cover my face saying ‚Äòbachche darr jaenge (kids will get scared)‚Äô. Many even pitied my state. A girl child is considered a burden right from the time she is in the womb. The parents‚Äô biggest concern when she is born is not her upbringing, but the dowry they‚Äôll have to start collecting. And if an incident like this occurs, the million-dollar question is‚Äîwho will marry her? Also, why is it that culprits only attack the woman‚Äôs face with acid, and not any other body part? Because the concept of a woman‚Äôs ‚Äòbeauty‚Äô has been ingrained in people‚Äôs minds by society. I want to question the mindset‚Äîwhy should I cover my face? What have I done wrong? Shouldn‚Äôt the culprit be hiding his face?
I was also advised to get back at the offender using acid, but I thought‚Äîthen, how are we different? If you want to teach such men a lesson, prove yourself. The fact that I‚Äôm here today is the biggest slap for my attacker. Fortunately, society has progressed, and we are more aware now ever since survivors started sharing their stories. Earlier, many would say they were burnt while using the stove or gas; today, women have the strength to tell their stories and fight for their rights. Up until recently, people wouldn‚Äôt call us for weddings; today they‚Äôre marrying us. Until recently, they‚Äôd not even look at us; today, they want selfies with us (smiles).
Deepika: I don‚Äôt think the mindset has changed or we have progressed, but I hope things change after this film.
