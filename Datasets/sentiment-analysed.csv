i1rlytoxQ1o,FAKE,Dark Secrets of Bachchan Family,"Dirty Secrets of the Bachchan Family. Do you know about Shweta Bachchan’s divorce? Many people may not know, that Shweta Bachchan is now divorced and she stays with her parents permanently. Yes, Shweta has been living separately from her husband Nikhil Nanda for last few years. But Bachchan family has never made this news official as this can affect their public image. Disturbed relationship between mother and daughter. Jaya Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan appear in public together with happy smile but in real life they don’t share good bonding. Shweta had to get married only at the age of 21 because of her mother but her married life was never been happy. So, Shweta consider her mother responsible for her divorce and unhappy married life. Do you know about the connection between Amitabh Bachchan and B-grade film? In 2003, Amitabh Bachchan did a B-grade film named ‘Boom’. Don’t get shocked as it’s true. He did the film for money only because he was going through a financial crisis at that time. Now let’s discuss about the cold war between nanad and bhabi. Shweta Bachchan and Aishwarya don’t even talk to each other properly and they avoid each other in public also. Actually Shweta is very close to Abhishek’s ex-girlfriend Karishma and she never accepts Aishwarya as the Bachchan bahu. Do we know about the hatred between Jaya Bachchan  and Aishwarya? Aishawarya was never the first choice to Jaya for Abhishek. Jaya wanted Rani Mukherjee as the perfect Bachchan Bahu.

Side by side, the Jaya Bachchan is always jealous of the extreme popularity of Aishwarya. So, she never became that much close to Aishwarya. There is another dirtiest thing in Bachchan family. This is the worst one. 

According to rumours, Bahu Aishwarya was romantically involved with Amitabh Bachchan. That’s why everyone in the family hates Aishwarya. We don’t know whether it’s true or just a rumour. Next on the list is Aishwarya’s downfall of career after marriage. Aishwarya always wanted to come back in bollywood after marriage but she was not able to do that only for Bachchan family. Bachchan family always inspire their daughter to start her career now but they have problem with Aishwarya’s comeback in bollywood. Now the last one  is Navya Naveli Nanda’s love affairs and arrogant lifestyle. The granddaughter of Bachchan family already made headlines with her many love affairs. Navya was once dating Shah Rukh’s son Aryan and the Bachchans were not happy. Then she got engaged with Meezan Jaffrey. She also leads an arrogant lifestyle. Most of the time she gets busy with party, alcohol and vacations with boyfriends

ttBZffinQeE,FAKE,Why Jaya Wanted to Divorce Amitabh Bachchan,"Why Jaya Wants to Divorce Amitabh Bachchan?Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan are one of the most ideal couples in Bollywood but, their marriage is not perfect as it shows in public. The couple had to go through lots of ups and downs in entire life because of many reasons. But do we know that there was a time when Jaya filed divorce case against Amitabh Bachchan. Yes, Jaya was all set to divorce her husband with whom she already spent long married life. Amitabh and Jaya got married after dating each other for a long time. Their marriage was approved by their families also. But, after marriage, Amitabh got more famous in bollywood and he also became a lady killer. Being the father of two children, Amitabh got engaged in extra-marital affairs with all his leading actresses at that time. Jaya Bachchan used to get such news everyday and those made her married life hell. And finally, Amitabh’s affair with Rekha drew an ending line in their married life. At that time, the news of Amitabh and Rekha’s secret marriage made the entire bollywood shocked. Amitabh Bacchan was father of Abhisekh and Shweta at that time but he had no time for their children. Jaya had to manage everything single-handedly as Amitabh was busy in affairs and shining career. Jaya also tried to keep her kids away from the effect of such gossips as these news started disturbing their childhood. Big B knew that Jaya was better actor than him and that’s why he stopped Jaya to continue her film career after marriage. All these things made Jaya frustrated already in her marriage and it was a pain for Jaya to continue her marriage with a careless man. She couldn’t take it anymore and wanted divorce from Amitabh to get rid of all these chaos in life. But, Big B was always obsessed with his public image. He knew that his divorce will create bad impact on his public image. Amitabh also knew that his divorce with Jaya will make her film career destroyed overnight. People were already started hating Amitabh for her extra marital affair with Rekha and they wanted him to go back to her wife. Amitabh didn’t want any gossip on his family life. So, he forced Jaya to continue her unhappy marriage . It was Shweta Bachchan who saw all these chaos from very close and that’s why she never wanted to be a part of bollywood. The affair of Rekha and Amitabh still makes headines when both of them attend in same public events

iphqRPaaeP8,FAKE,Titanic 2 - Jack's Back Reboot  (2023 Movie Trailer Parody),"Are you ready to go back to Titanic?  Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) reunite in this new Titanic 2 reboot trailer. On an expedition to retrieve the priceless heart of the ocean diamond, a recovery team makes a shocking discovery.  

This trailer was created in collaboration with Billy Crammer.  
Check out his work.  It's super amazing!
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVr5w2wms3tkdZFmXbrY_nA

This trailer has an interesting history.  It's a reboot of my first Titanic 2 trailer (Jacks Back) which has over 50 million views.  I wanted to take the same plot, but give it a modern take and update it to be more realistic.  Everything was redone for this video.  New voices were recorded, new effects work, new music, and new footage filmed.  There is also a big plot twist this time around.

This trailer is also my first ever collaboration.  It's a 2023 version.  I hired a super talented editor by the name of Billy Crammer to create this.  Check out his channel for amazing, high quality edits (his stuff always looks professional, mine is a little more silly).  He did a brilliant job creating the core of this video, then I went in and added some silliness to match the content of my regular work.

And if you're reading this far and you're still confused, this is not a real movie.  It's a parody trailer (sometimes called a fan trailer or concept trailer).  Fan trailers take existing material and through the use of editing, effects work, voiceovers and music, a new and original narrative is created.

These types of videos are a great way to gauge interest in a new film or sequel (plus they're a fantastic creative outlet).

This is actually my fourth Titanic 2 trailer.  I have the original Jacks Back (which this is based on).  There is also Titanic 2: Never Let Go which is the horror sequel.  And finally there's the feel-good, happy ending in Titanic 2: The Return of Jack. 

If you enjoyed this trailer please check out some of my previous work including Speed 3: Flight Risk, The Nanny Reboot, Harry Potter and the Demon Child, Home Alone: Christmas Reunion and many many more.  Thanks guys!

The Eternals are a fictional species of humanity appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They are described as an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth. The original instigators of this process, the alien Celestials, intended the Eternals to be the defenders of Earth, which leads to the inevitability of war against their destructive counterparts, the Deviants. The Eternals were created by Jack Kirby and made their first appearance in The Eternals #1 (July 1976). The Eternals will debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with their own feature film Eternals on November 6th, 2020.

zDQ_bfjIhAw,FAKE,BBC: Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Dies at 47 After a Terrible Stunt Attempt Failure,"Dwayne Johnson death hoax: No, The Rock didn’t die after failed stunt
Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has become the target of a viral death hoax. The 47-year-old actor is not dead; however, thousands of unsuspecting fans shared the fake news on their social media timeline.

A hoax news story that has been circulating on Facebook claiming the actor and WWE star died after a failed stunt with the following headline: “BBC: Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Dies at 47 after a terrible stunt attempted failed.”

The hoax used the BBC News (British Broadcasting Corporation) label to appear as a legitimate news organization. However, the link circulating on Facebook directs users to a hoax website.

A search on the BBC News website for the terms “Dwayne Johnson dead” or “Dwayne Johnson death” does not garner any results similar to the link being shared on social media.
Dwayne Johnson is one of the most influential entertainers with 14 million Twitter followers and over 160 million Instagram followers.
Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has not responded to the death hoax and is focusing on one of his many projects. The ‘Hobbs and Shaw’ actor updated his Instagram account with a photo of his upcoming Under Armour campaign.
This isn’t the first time the internet has declared Johnson dead. The actor debunked a death hoax in 2011 on Facebook. In 2014, a similar hoax claimed the actor died while shooting a stunt for Fast and Furious 7.

Dwayne Johnson recently appeared at UFC 244: Masvidal vs. Diaz where he presented the winner of the main event Jorge Masvidal with the BMF belt.

The actor recently wrapped up filming Jumanji: The Next Level and is producing an MMA film about mixed martial arts fighter Mark “The Smashing Machine’ Kerr.
The Rock is alive and well, the actor has not immediately responded to a  request for comment on this report.",1564,779,333062,0.09987959265708923,0.3638191223144531,0.004002525005489588,0.3710572421550751,0.1563643515110016,0.00487716868519783

At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.
“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,” said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

8rbz0_rMHsM,FAKE,Ripe black bananas have the effect of preventing cancer,"Bananas turn to dark spots to enhance antioxidants, and the more nutrients they can absorb into the body.

When buying bananas, everyone has the habit of picking beautiful, shiny yellow bananas and seeing bananas that have turned dark spots often ""ignored"". However, people do not know that. These black-spotted bananas are really a nutritional ""treasure"".
Black-spotted bananas have anti-cancer properties and enhance antioxidants
Tsurumi Takashi - a famous Japanese doctor and nutritionist explained many benefits of ""black banana"" in his book ""Black banana health therapy"". He pointed out that the new black-spotted ripe banana is the ""nutritional peak"" actually, the antioxidant effect is significantly enhanced, enzymes are increased and nutrients are easily absorbed into the body.

Studies at Teikyo University show that ripe bananas turn into black spots with many beneficial ingredients such as: can lead to tumor necrosis (TNF) reaching the highest level to kill death of cancer cells, serotonin in bananas also increased, this substance called ""happy hormone"" helps regulate mood, reduce stress, anger and promote bowel movements.
Takashi expert Tsurumi said that eating bananas is best with 40 to 60% black spots. This means bananas transform into natural and healthy black spots. On the other hand, if the banana peel changes color due to crushing or dark spots covering an area greater than 60%, the bananas are broken and need to be discarded.
6 benefits of the popular banana fruit for health
Bananas are a popular, popular and very cheap fruit, but it offers great health benefits for humans.

Bananas have many health benefits
1. Rich in potassium ions, helps regulate blood pressure.
2. Bananas are high in fiber that can promote bowel movements, help digestion, prevent constipation.
3. Vitamin B6-rich bananas help maintain nervous system health.

4. Bananas contain sugar and lots of vitamins and minerals easily absorbed into the body, suitable for consuming bananas before and after exercising to replenish energy.
5. Bananas contain tryptophan, help regulate mood and reduce fatigue.
6. The highest mineral content in bananas is manganese, which helps maintain brain function, strengthens bones and improves skin health.
However, because bananas contain relatively high levels of sugar and potassium, diabetics and kidneys should avoid eating much (preferably on the advice of a dietitian).
Make a snack with black spotted bananas, delicious and nutritious flavor
Many banana desserts are made from ripe bananas that turn into dark spots, because at this time ripe bananas are sweet enough to combine with other ingredients to help flavor the dish more fragrant. American dietitian Josh Ax introduced a recipe for banana bread, not only fragrant by the taste of bananas but also a healthy supplement for the body.
Ingredient:

- 4 chicken eggs, 3 ripe bananas (mashed), 1/4 cup of honey, 1/4 cup of coconut milk, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 2 teaspoons of baking soda, 2 parts 1/4 cup of almond flour, ½ cup of sea salt, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.
Making:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (about 177 degrees C).
- Mix bananas, eggs, honey, coconut milk and vanilla in a bowl.
- Take another bowl and mix baking soda, almond powder, sea salt and cinnamon.
- Combine two bowls of ingredients and mix well until a thick paste. Take the bread baking tray, lubricate the tray with cooking oil, then pour the flour into the tray and bake in the oven for 35 to 50 minutes",0,2,242,0.05140559375286102,0.01867036335170269,0.001517217606306076,0.8438204526901245,0.08287331461906433,0.0017130209598690271

His father was a landlord and fruit merchant who owned orchards in Peshawar and Deolali. Mohammad Yusuf Khan was schooled at Barnes School, Deolali, Nashik.[12] He grew up in the same religiously mixed neighbourhood as Raj Kapoor, his childhood friend.[3]

With the help of a Parsi café-owner and an elderly Anglo-Indian couple, Kumar met a canteen contractor. Without letting on his family antecedents, he got the job on the merit of his knowledge of good written and spoken English. He set up a sandwich stall at the army club and when the contract ended, he headed home to Mumbai, having saved Rs. 5000.[13]

In 1942, anxious to start a venture to help his father with household finances, he met Dr. Masani at Churchgate Station, who asked him to accompany him to Bombay Talkies, in Malad. There he met actress Devika Rani, owner of Bombay Talkies, who asked him to sign up with the company on a salary of Rs. 1250 per month.[14] There he met actor Ashok Kumar, who influenced his acting style by telling him to act ""natural"".

Undertale is a role-playing video game created by indie developer Toby Fox. In the game, players control a human child who has fallen into the Underground, a large, secluded region underneath the surface of the Earth, separated by a magic barrier.

Basic Vanilla Cake:
1 1/2 c. sifted cake flour
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 c. unsalted butter
1 c. sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 c. whole milk

Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat an 8-inch cake pan with butter and dust with all-purpose flour. Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl.

Beat in the butter one heaping 1/4 teaspoonful at a time, using an electric mixer set on low speed, until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Beat in the sugar a tablespoon at a time, until the mixture resembles fine damp sand. 

Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla and milk, and beat on medium-high, just until blended. Do not overbeat.

Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean—30 to 35 minutes. Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
Un-mold and cool completely. Ice with Browned-Butter Glaze.

y5RkYqydf1U,FAKE,Bachchan Pandey Trailer | Akshay Kumar | Kriti Sanon | Ibrahim Ali Khan,"Akshay Kumar in Bachchan Pandey's new poster will indeed make you do a double take. The 52-year-old actor shared a brand new poster, featuring himself in the persona of the titular character, to actually announce a new release date of the film. In the new poster, Bachchan Pandey appears to have come a long way, battling hurdles along his journey - in a sharp contrast to the first poster released in July last year, Akshay's character is bruised with a scar across his face, heavily bearded and mustachioed, with an injured eye. However, certain remains unchanged - his aggressive stare and intense expression.

The news about the popular rapper's demise spread like wild fire recently. So is he really no more?

Our hearts almost skipped a beat when we heard that the famous rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh has died in an accident. The pictures of him lying dead on a hospital bed also went viral on the web, which deeply saddened the Lungi Dance singer's legion of fans.

However, it later turned out that all those reports were fake. And the pictures are a snapshot from his song Bring Me Back. Honey Singh is very much alive. In fact, the rapper is currently in Dubai, where he has launched a boxing league by the name of Global Fighting Championship.

And let us tell you that Honey Singh is not the only celebrity who has been a victim of such reports. Last year Madhuri Dixit Nene's fans went berserk when rumours of the dhak dhak girl passing away did the rounds on the internet. The entire confusion started when an obituary of the actor's namesake who passed away in an unfortunate accident appeared in the newspapers. However, the Dedh Ishqiya actor made sure to calm her fans down by appearing on Twitter and claiming it to be some sort of a mistake.

And how can we forget the rumours about Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Parekh and Dilip Kumar's death that made rounds on Twitter very recently

Yes, this is a fan trailer (or a concept trailer).  Fan trailers are often misunderstood.  These videos transform existing footage through the use of editing, professional voice artists, and heavy effects work (in After Effects).  

These videos take many weeks of editing to create.  I take existing content and transform it into an entirely original fictional film.  Unfortunately that this movie WON'T be coming to a cinema anytime soon.

I loved making this video.  Anytime I work with Pixar content it requires a lot of heavy editing (as I only have the source footage to work with).  The great thing about Moana is that so much of it takes place on the ocean.  Why is that great?  Because it makes removing the background so much easier! 

As an editor this video was a lot of fun to make.  I also wrote a script and hired a professional voice artist to impersonate the character of Moana's grandma.  She did an amazing job!

Footage used in this trailer came from the following sources.

Moana
Secret Life of Pets
Drake - Hotline Bling.

Yet to this day, she has no formal qualifications to her name. Her career has been built upon a symphony of seemingly normal opportunities that evolved into extraordinary, life changing events.

Maisie tells the story of working on what ended up becoming the biggest television show of all time from the age of 12. She discusses why she thinks right now is the perfect time to build tools for communities and how her platform, daisie, will redefine creative collaboration.

Margaret Constance Williams, known as Maisie Williams, is an English actress. She made her professional acting debut in 2011 as Arya Stark of Winterfell in the HBO world phenomenon Game of Thrones. Selected among 300 British actresses, she plays the role of a tomboyish young girl from a noble family for which she won numerous awards.

Her broad artistic life led her to co-found Daisie, a social media aimed at creative people in the world of arts, fashion, tv, film, photography, music, and literature. The aim of the app is to bring individuals from across industries together, to help foster collaborations with other artists and provide an alternative route into creative industries. Maisie said “Our main goal is to have a community of artists that are collaborating, uploading their work and sharing their projects.. helping others create their careers.”

“Blue Monday” – performed by New Order. Also performed by Sebastian Böhm.

Fast forward to the 1980s as Wonder Woman’s next big screen adventure finds her facing two all-new foes: Max Lord and The Cheetah.
With director Patty Jenkins back at the helm and Gal Gadot returning in the title role, “Wonder Woman 1984” is Warner Bros. Pictures’ follow up to the DC Super Hero’s first outing, 2017’s record-breaking “Wonder Woman,” which took in $822 million at the worldwide box office. The film also stars Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Kristen Wiig as The Cheetah, Pedro Pascal as Max Lord, Robin Wright as Antiope, and Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta.
Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot and Stephen Jones are producing the film. Rebecca Steel Roven Oakley, Richard Suckle, Marianne Jenkins, Geoff Johns, Walter Hamada, Chantal Nong Vo and Wesley Coller are the executive producers.
Patty Jenkins directed from a screenplay she wrote with Geoff Johns & David Callaham, story by Jenkins & Johns, based on characters from DC. Joining the director behind the scenes are several members of her “Wonder Woman” team, including director of photography Matthew Jensen, Oscar-nominated production designer Aline Bonetto (“Amélie”), and Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (“Topsy-Turvy”). Oscar-nominated editor Richard Pearson (“United 93”) is cutting the film. The music is by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer (“Dunkirk,” “The Lion King”).
Warner Bros. Pictures Presents an Atlas Entertainment/Stone Quarry Production, a Patty Jenkins Film, “Wonder Woman 1984.” Set to open in theaters only in 2D and 3D in select theaters and IMAX, it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.

Jay:
Can’t nobody do it any better than the way you do
Girl you got me caught up in my feelings because it’s all about you
Guru:
Akhiyan ch paa k ni tu surma surma
Sikheya tu dass kithon turna turna,
Akhiyan ch paa k ni tu surma surma
Sikheya tu dass kithon turna turna.

Jeda suit tu paya aa, paya aa
Sab puchde ne kithon milda aa
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Oo Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Jay:
Girl the way you walking around you’re so inconsiderate
Everything you rocking girl you know that I’m feeling it
It’s everything that you do to me 
you break all the rules you ain’t gotta play
You know the sun can shine on you in the night and day
You put a hold on time in a sudden give me chills without touching
All these things that you do to me

Saara panga teri gall waale till da aa
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Oo Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Surme ne lutt leya dil dil
Dil kehnda hun kalli kithe mil mil
Tere Surme ne lutt leya dil dil
Dil kehnda hun kalli kithe mil 

Ni jeda tere kol reh gaya rakhi mere dil da khyaal
Ni vekhi kithe tod na devi guru da hojuga bura haal

Jay:
Coz I’m stuck in the middle a little and didn’t do anything
Didn’t even gimme a reason but you still teasing me 
But I gotta be and I wanna be with you baby

Ni jeda tere kol reh gaya rakhi mere dil da khyaal
Ni vekhi kithe tod na devi guru da hojuga bura haal
Rabb di soun maamla dil da aa

Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Dekh dekh hoyi jaanda haal bura dil da aa
Oo Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa
Jay:
Can’t nobody do it any better than the way you do
Guru:
Kaali teri gutt golmol lakk hilda aa

LYRICS OF BLUE EYES
-----------------------------------------------

""Blue Eyes"", hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, bomb lagdi mennu,bomb lagdi mennu.

Meri Akhon mein dekha kar jab mein baat karta hu, Mein woh londe nhi jo tere sath padta hu, White Ginni laya hu,Tuje pic karlu, Dekh lunga ashiq or teri teacher nu, Leke chalu ride pe fir chath(roof) kholke, Seedhi baat karu ,na karu tolmol ke, Tonight ,i gotta hold you tight, Aaj hogi late phone karke ghar pe bolde.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Ghar pe chalna hai ya pehle jayegi club, Nhi mera matlab, Ghar ke Club, Tab Lunga left,nahi to right, Club mien hoga shor,baby ghar pe pillow fight You Decide ke kya karna hai, Tujko to jra sa bhi darna hai Champagne ger di hai tune meri pant pe, Kehti hai change karlo hôtel lekar rent pe.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, glossy Lips, uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Suna tere college mein mere gane ban hai, Padne likhne ka tera na koi plan hai, Pass kradu, Phone Ghumadu ,teri Principal bhi baby YO YO ki fan hai, Teri Principal bhi baby YO YO ki fan hai, Kehndi YO YO Honey singh.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, bomb lagdi menu,bomb lagdi mennu.",5118099,145899,628179630,0.02075405977666378,0.907873809337616,0.03603971749544144,0.02068271115422249,0.009489470161497593,0.005160245578736067

O Munda Ode Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Duniya Jide Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Munda Ode Te Crazy
Haan Din Vichon Tere Lai Time Kadh Ke
Karda Main Promise Milan Aaunga
Mainu Pata Ae Tu Fan Salman Khan Di
Ode Gaane Gaake Tainu Main Sunaunga
Hovaan Date Pe Naa Late
Gal Seedhi Karan Straight
Hovaan Date Pe Naa Late
Gal Seedhi Karan Straight
Hor Mundeyaan De Waangu Karan Gallan Naa Cheezi
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Duniya Jide Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
O Munda Ode Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Duniya Jide Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Munda Ode Te Crazy
Tune Kiya Kuch Aisa Ki Main Baaki Sab
Ladkiyon Ke Bare Mein Sochna Chhod Raha Hoon
Mana Ki Thoda Busy Hoon
Teri Meri Shaadi Ke Liye Main Paise Jod Raha Hoon
Kabse Karun Tujhko Main Chase Baby
Dil Mein Mujhe Dede Thodi Space Baby
Na Mujhpe Koi Cheating Wala Case Baby
Shareef Hoon Main Dekh Mera Face Baby
Mujh Pe Ab Tera Jaadu Hai
Meri Khushboo Mein Teri Khushboo Hai
Saara Jag Bhul Ab Mere Liye
Miss World Miss Universe Baby Tu Hai
Tere Saath Ghumu Tujhe Duniya Dikhaunga
Na Tujhse Kabhi Door Na Jaunga
Bol To Sahi Dil Khol To Sahi
Aise Bina Bole Jayegi To Pagal Ho Jaunga
Haan
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Duniya Jide Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
O Munda Ode Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Duniya Jide Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Munda Ode Te Crazy

Genre: Action Thriller  
Cast: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, John Cena, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, with Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron 
Director: Justin Lin 
Written by: Dan Casey
Based on Characters Created by: Gary Scott Thompson 
Producers: Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend, Samantha Vincent

No matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past. 

Summer 2020 is the time for F9, the ninth chapter in the saga that has endured for almost two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  

Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, next year’s The Suicide Squad). 

F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tblisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  

The film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom’s past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  

F9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.",392270,27549,20631897,0.1973879337310791,0.008860754780471325,0.001115818158723414,0.7894763946533203,0.002476802561432123,0.0006823137518949807
HZ7PAyCDwEg,REAL,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw - Official Trailer #2 [HD],"Hobbs & Shaw
In Theaters August 2, 2019
https://www.HobbsAndShawMovie.com
 
After eight films that have amassed almost $5 billion worldwide, the Fast & Furious franchise now features its first stand-alone vehicle as Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham reprise their roles as Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw in Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw.
 
Ever since hulking lawman Hobbs (Johnson), a loyal agent of America's Diplomatic Security Service, and lawless outcast Shaw (Statham), a former British military elite operative, first faced off in 2015’s Furious 7, the duo have swapped smack talk and body blows as they’ve tried to take each other down.
 
But when cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton (Idris Elba) gains control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever — and bests a brilliant and fearless  rogue MI6 agent (The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby), who just happens to be Shaw’s sister — these two sworn enemies will have to partner up to bring down the only guy who might be badder than themselves.
 
Hobbs & Shaw blasts open a new door in the Fast universe as it hurtles action across the globe, from Los Angeles to London and from the toxic wasteland of Chernobyl to the lush beauty of Samoa.   
 
Directed by David Leitch (Deadpool 2) from a script by longtime Fast & Furious narrative architect Chris Morgan, the film is produced by Morgan, Johnson, Statham and Hiram Garcia. The executive producers are Dany Garcia, Kelly McCormick, Steven Chasman, Ethan Smith and Ainsley Davies.",461486,28218,123214012,0.0018564059864729643,0.9789310693740845,0.01675446704030037,0.001536568976007402,0.0006186290993355215,0.0003028302453458309

7NiYVoqBt-8,REAL,Dumbo Official Trailer,"Watch the new trailer for Dumbo, and see the film when it soars to theatres March 29, 2019!

From Disney and visionary director Tim Burton, “Dumbo” expands on the beloved classic story where differences are celebrated, family is cherished and dreams take flight. A new trailer, images and poster are now available. The trailer features Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Finley Hobbins and Nico Parker.

Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus. But when they discover that Dumbo can fly, the circus makes an incredible comeback, attracting persuasive entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland. Dumbo soars to new heights alongside a charming and spectacular aerial artist, Colette Marchant (Eva Green), until Holt learns that beneath its shiny veneer, Dreamland is full of dark secrets.

Synopsis:
India’s top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the crème de la crème of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra’s key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country.

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir’s team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid’s intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir’s greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country’s enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid.

But Khalid’s greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero’s head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists – he is the best protégé and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question – why did he turn rogue?

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as protégé goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

Lyrics 

Dusre ke pyaar Mai girne se tujhe bacha raha hu
Sab mujhe bhao de rahi 
Firbhi sabko wata raha hu
Tere baar mai sabko Achi baateh bata raha hu
Tere liye ghar pe mummy daddy ko Mai mana raha hu
Wazan meri thodi Ghata raha hu
Tujhe lean body pasand hai 
Mai healthy khaane chaba raha hu
Sunne Mai aaya hai tu London mai rehti hai
Abbi ke abbi jaake phehli ticket kata raha hu

(Rap 1)

Tu toh rapchick hai situation badi drastic hai 
Tera smile both hard baaki sabki plastic hai
Door khadhi achi nahi lagrahi tu mere pass theek hai 
Haath se khaata tha tere liye kharaha chopstick se 
Optic se alag alag chasma liya ghar phocha toh mom stick se maari mujhe sadma diya 
Boli ki tu pyaar mai nahi padhna lekin mai padhne laga tha 
Teri chaal sab kamal apsara yeh razor gaal 
Sab bawaal ho jayega mere saath reke dekh
Tujhe koi na milega pure raaste pe ek 
Banda mere jaisa, rehre kaisa jaisa teko chahiye tu bhi apne pe fida toh ek number sahi hai

(Rap 2)
Nazar nahi hatreli meri teri pe faseli 
Tu dimaag mai chapeli, kyuki tu pateli nahi karti baby auro ki tarha,
Mera aaj Abhi Aur tomorrow bhi tera 
Tere saamne mai seedha baki banda Mai tedha 
Sab kehte banna mat yeda 
Meko toh khaane ka peda 
Tera jo mera  mera jo Tera 
Ujala bhar daala tune toh andheraich nahi hai
Baasmati tukda nahi be lamba rice chahiye 
Apna life sahi hai sabka life sahi hai 
Jindagi ko sahi taur pe jeene wala chahiye
Jo bhi baat bola Maine sab baat sahi hai
Chodh dunga teko aisa koi shot nahi hai

Get back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on
You feel it
But you got it all
Believe it

When you fall get up, oh oh

-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me 
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 
 
About Ed Sheeran: 
Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. 

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. 
 
In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’.

Stream/Download: https://marshmello.ffm.to/alone

A lot of people ask me where Alone and its lyrics comes from. Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn’t belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn’t really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you’re homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren’t like everyone else…its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family…a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone. I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do. It gives me the feels for sure.

Lyrics:
You were the shadow of my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
These shallow waters, never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monsters running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
I'm faded

Lyrics: Sorry – Justin Bieber
 
You gotta go and get 
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies 
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 
 
I know you know that I 
made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once or twice I Mean 
Maybe a couple a hundred times 
So let me oh let me 
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I’m sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I’m sorry now
 
I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me too 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)

Lyrics:
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re so indecisive of what I’m saying
Don’t want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you’re down and then between

Ohh I really want to know…

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won’t let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you’re down and then between
Ohh I really want to know…
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.

Lyrics:

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
You know you want me
So don’t keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you’re my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you, yeah
But there are mountains (There are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you’re wondering why
Because we’re able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars (Rewrite the stars)
How can you say you’ll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
(The one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me, yeah
When everyone tells us what we can be (Tells us what we can)
And how can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight (Be ours)

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It’s not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

And how do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
And nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.

Lyrics: 

I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
Uh, we were only 11
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)
Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

bkho0RB0zz0,REAL,The Small Escape.,"1964. Berlin is a divided city. Flight from the German Democratic Republic is punished with an order to fire. Still, many people desperately try to cross the border. For all backgrounds to the true history of the spectacular escape, read the article here: https://b.mw/isetta_escape_story

People forge identity papers, dig tunnels, climb into hot-air balloons and hide in cars going to the West - towards freedom. But as large vehicles are getting controlled more frequently and thoroughly, a West Berliner has a seemingly impossible but ingenious idea: the smallest and most inconspicuous car available at the time, the BMW Isetta, should help him smuggle a man across the border into the West.

Director Todd Phillips “Joker” centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen.  Phillips’ exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham’s fractured society.  A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night…but finds the joke always seems to be on him.

Evil resurfaces in Derry as director Andy Muschietti reunites the Losers Club—young and adult—in a return to where it all began with “It Chapter Two.”

The film is Muschietti’s follow-up to 2017’s critically acclaimed and massive worldwide box office hit “IT,” which grossed over $700 million globally.  Both redefining and transcending the genre, “IT” became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.

Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, “It Chapter Two” brings the characters—who’ve long since gone their separate ways—back together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  

Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty,” “Mama”) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (“Split,” upcoming “Glass”) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO’s “Barry,” “The Skeleton Twins”) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV’s “Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments”) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV’s “Mary Kills People”) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO’s “The Wire”) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (“Allegiant,” Starz’ “Power”) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsgård returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  

Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (“IT,” “Annabelle: Creation”) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (“The 33”), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“The Shape of Water”), editor Jason Ballantine (“IT,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (“The Shape of Water,” “Mama”).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“Shazam!,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “IT”).

Director Todd Phillips “Joker” centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen.  Phillips’ exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham’s fractured society.  A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night…but finds the joke always seems to be on him.  Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study.

Furious 7 (often stylized as Furious Seven and alternatively known as Fast Seven or Fast & Furious 7) [7] is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the seventh installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. Furious 7 follows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker) and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts them in danger once again.[8]

With the previous three installments set between 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), Furious 7 is the first installment in the franchise to take place after Tokyo Drift. The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a single-vehicle accident on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.[9] Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites, and his brothers, Caleb and Cody, were used among others as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.[10]

Plans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of Fast & Furious 6. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of Justin Lin, who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the re-signing of Diesel and Walker, and an initial release date was set. Principal photography began in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including Los Angeles, Colorado, Abu Dhabi and Tokyo.

Furious 7 premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015, and was first released in Australia on April 2, 2015, and then in the United States on April 3, 2015. The film was also released in 3D, IMAX 3D, and 4DX internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and commercial success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its tribute to Walker. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide in its first five days of release, which is the third-highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise after just twelve days, the second-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time.

FjoNDEgjErk,REAL,We Finally Understand What Happened With The Rock And Tyrese,"Apparently two of the stars of the Fast & Furious franchise have taken the series’ title to heart, as they have been engaged in a bitter social media feud that has gone on for years. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who started playing Luke Hobbs in 2011’s Fast Five, has been fighting with co-star Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce. Gibson is apparently mad at Johnson for starring in the spin-off film Hobbs and Shaw, but it goes back farther than that. Let’s take a look at what really started that ongoing feud between The Rock and Tyrese Gibson, and see if it shows any signs of dying down.

Lo-8FwfLWiU,REAL,Strangest Things Accidentally Filmed In Movies,"Ideally, extras shouldn’t steal the show in a movie. If you notice them, they’re probably not very good at their job, but there are a few examples of people or animals in the backgrounds of movies that audiences couldn’t help but look at.

Maybe the editor didn’t catch these truly bizarre moments, or maybe it was the best take they had in spite of the accident, but they all led to a few laughs. From the truly weird animal moment in Mr. Nanny to the cowboy who pops up in a pirate movie, let’s take a look at some of the strangest things that were accidentally filmed in movie backgrounds.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Dom (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) try to stop a tank that's being driven by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Jah (Joe Taslim).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) summons Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew to London in order to take on a team of mercenary drivers who have caused havoc across a dozen countries in this pedal-to-the-metal installment of the rubber-burning action franchise. Having just earned a tidy $100 million for taking down a ruthless criminal kingpin, Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) have decided to lie low for a while. Fugitives from the law, they're constantly looking over their shoulders, no matter where they travel. Meanwhile, the malevolent leader of an elusive criminal outfit (Luke Evans) has incurred the wrath of Agent Hobbs, who has decided that the only way to shut them down is to beat them on their own turf. Realizing that Dom knows the only drivers in the world with the skills to get the job done, Agent Hobbs offers them all full pardons if they will come to London, and get back behind the wheel. The closer the renegade drivers get to the organization, however, the more apparent it becomes that Dom's former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is not only still alive, but a key figure among their ranks. Now, with their freedom finally within reach, Dom and the team reassemble for their most dangerous mission to date.

_arK4MTbcTM,REAL,The 2 Fast 2 Furious Car Scramble feat. the 9-11 Tribute to America Truck,"The 9-11 Tribute to America Truck was built starting 3 weeks after the dreadful day that we will never forget in New York City.  The creator of the 911 Tribute To America Truck Anthony Pristera was a New York Fire Fighter who took the truck to ground zero after completion in 2002 and was given the key to New York City from Rudolph Guilliani and Governor Pataki.  

 Anthony's 9-11 Tribute to America Truck was not only seen at Ground Zero but also made the front cover of 7 national magazines, it took first place in numberous custom car shows in Florida, and can be seen in the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious.  Anthony says just the air brush paint on the truck covering it from head lights to tail lights was over $64,000.  Anthony stated that the truck upon completion totaled close to 1/4 million dollars.  

Today Anthony Pristera's Tribute To America Truck can be seen at Carville's Auto Mart in Grand Junction, Co.  Here it is used to honor our military and veterans and helps with local fundraising events like the Community Food Bank by being present across the grand valley.  During the 2016 Colorado Mesa University Homecoming Parade Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto former US Army Ranger Hero of Benghazi's Libya Attack and co-author of the best selling book ""13 Hours in Benghazi"" led the parade in the Carville's Auto Mart Tribute to America Truck and did a live feed speaking of the Patriotism that this community brings and what this truck represents.   The Tribute Truck can also be seen every December in the Parade of Lights with our Military Forces marching down Main St in Grand Junction, Co. Stop by Carville's Auto Mart to show your patriotism and pay tribute to this remarkable symbol of our American History.

Caught up in Toretto's world of gang conflict that is resolved in late-night car races, Spindler starts to sympathize with his chief suspect and falls in love with Toretto's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). In the meantime, Spindler initially suspects the wrong gang of complicity in the crimes he's probing, while Toretto remains involved in a forbidden romance, à la Romeo and Juliet, with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).

Film Description: A magazine article about real-life car racing gangs for Vibe becomes this fast-paced automotive thriller from director Rob Cohen. Paul Walker stars as Brian O'Conner, a youthful FBI agent investigating a series of hijackings by going undercover with a street gang led by charismatic Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Caught up in Toretto's world of gang conflict that is resolved in late-night car races, Spindler starts to sympathize with his chief suspect and falls in love with Toretto's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). In the meantime, Spindler initially suspects the wrong gang of complicity in the crimes he's probing, while Toretto remains involved in a forbidden romance, à la Romeo and Juliet, with his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). The Fast and the Furious co-stars Ted Levine, Rick Yune, and Matt Schulze.",94955,2366,17286189,0.0016504585510119796,0.003709691110998392,0.0007482859073206782,0.8212918639183044,0.17149968445301056,0.001099976128898561

LYRICS:
Bheed mein hai mann kyun akela?
Ghul mil gaye hain, anjaan chehre..

Kaun hai ab mera basera?
Tu jo nahi hai, ab saath mere..

Agar aana hai toh jaldi chale aa
Rootha khada hoon, darwaaze pe..

Gaye kyun magar, mere humsafar
Jahan ka hai mushkil milna pata..
Mere dil zara, usi rahguzar
Pe le chal mujhe phir ek dafa..

Raat ki jaagi aankhon ne dekha savera..
Beete naa jaane, aise kitne mahine..

Chubhan, ghutan hai mann ke mere sagey yaar
Chodhey na chootey, aise jigri kameeney..
 
Khuda se mere hai meri iltija..
Tujhse mila de, yaa khud se.. 

Gaye kyun magar, mere humsafar
Jahan ka hai mushkil milna pata..
Mere dil zara, usi rahguzar
Pe le chal mujhe phir ek dafa..

Agar aana hai toh jaldi chale aa
Rootha khada hoon, darwaaze pe..

Lyrics:

Dekho, hulchul machi hai
Saare sheher mein, jo tum ho mere..
Suno, kya keh rahi hai
Yeh sard hawaayein, mere kaano mein..

Paaya hai jo chaaha
Rab se jo maanga, kehti hai jhoot laqeerein..
Kismat se pehle na kismat se zyaada
Mila hai har kisi ko zindagi mein..

Baaton hi baaton mein tera yun muskuraana
Sang Hoon Tere
Sang Hoon Tere
Tu Mera aashiyana tu mera hai thikaana
Sang Hoon Tere
Sang Hoon Tere

(Chorus Repeat)

Socha, kya tumne mere baare mein
Pehli mulaqaat mein..
Kya main vaisa hoon jaisa dekha tha tumne
Apne khwaab mein..

Paaya hai jo chaaha
Rab se jo maanga, kehti hai jhoot laqeerein..
Kismat se pehle na kismat se zyaada
Mila hai har kisi ko zindagi mein..

Baaton hi baaton mein tera yun muskuraana
Sang Hoon Tere
Sang Hoon Tere
Tu Mera aashiyana tu mera hai thikaana
Sang Hoon Tere
Sang Hoon Tere

Dekho yun hi nahi koi 
raahon mein milta hai..
Samjho phool wahi hai jo 
baaghon mein khilta hai..
Samjho, tum hi ho woh phool
Jiska bhawar main hoon dekho..
Socho, agar tum aur main 
ek ho jaaye toh kya hoga..
Socho, kya jashn hoga aur kya hi sama hoga..
Socho, muskuraayenge sitaare jo soyenge
Hum unki chaadar mein..

Baaton hi baaton mein tera yun muskuraana
Sang Hoon Tere
Sang Hoon Tere
Tu Mera aashiyana tu mera hai thikaana
Sang Hoon Tere
Sang Hoon Tere",868431,56539,19446772,0.00955311767756939,0.28703582286834717,0.7001849412918091,0.0012456608237698674,0.0010327856289222836,0.0009476143750362098

LYRICS
Aasman ke rang dekh hi raha hoon main,
Kabhi neela hai, Kabhi laal hai
Kabhi peela hai, Kabhi narangi
Kabhi satrangi, Kabhi baingani..

Baaton baaton mein kar baithe mulaqaatein,
Tu hi toh hai jisey dhoondti hai meri aankhein,
Dekhoon kabhi daye, kabhi baaye,
Kabhi peeche kabhi mere aagey..

Teri meri meri teri ek kahaani hai,
Baatein kuch ankahee kuch bataani hai..
Shaam savere tujhe dhoonda maine,
Jaane kis kis gali..
Teri meri meri teri baatein puraani hai.

Kya mera kya tera hai yahan.
Jo bhi hai bas usko baat le..
Jitne bhi pal tere mere sang,
Khushi khushi hanstey hanstey tu kaat le..
Aane nahin doonga palkon pe aansoo
tere main kabhi..
Mujhko sataaye agar mujhko rulaaye
Kuch bolunga nahin..
Aane nahin doonga palkon pe aansoo
tere main kabhi..
Mujhko sataaye agar mujhko rulaaye
Kuch bolunga nahin..

Baaton baaton mein kar baithe mulaqaatein,
Tu hi toh hai jisey dhoondti hai meri aankhein,
Dekhoon kabhi daye, kabhi baaye,
Kabhi peeche kabhi mere aagey..

Teri meri meri teri ek kahaani hai,
Baatein kuch ankahee kuch bataani hai..
Shaam savere tujhe dhoonda maine,
Jaane kis kis gali..

Synopsis: 
Befikre is a story that celebrates being carefree in love.  A quintessential Delhi boy Dharam (Ranveer Singh) comes to Paris for work in search of an adventure. Just when he was about to embark on this journey of his life he bumps into a wild, free spirited, French born Indian girl Shyra (Vaani Kapoor).

A feisty romance ensues between the two in which both of their personalities - one being an equal match for the other are tested to the limit. Battling their ups and downs, both realize that love is a leap of faith that can only be taken by those who dare to love.

Lyrics:
Tujhse mann nahi hai bharta…

Tera buzz mujhe jeene na de
Jeene na de [x4]

Tujhse mann nahi hai bharta
Ab tu hi hai karta dharta
Tujhse mann nahi hai bharta
Ab tu hi hai karta dharta
Aur tu paani tak peene na de
Peene na de…

Tera buzz mujhe jeene na de
Jeene na de [x4]

Tripy hain aankhein teri
Ghunghraale baal hain
Chalta jaise sab uske bapu ka maal hai
Chalta jaise sab uske bapu ka maal hai

Aur tu kamar pakad ke kheeche
Haaye daiyya pairon ke neeche
Aur tu kamar pakad ke kheeche
Haaye daiyya pairon ke neeche
Mere rehne tu zameene na de, meene na de

Tera buzz mujhe jeene na de, jeene na de [x4]
(Rehne de, rehne de…)

[Badshah Rap:]
Okay, okay, okay, hai maana tu hai sick
Jahaan se hona chaahiye wahin se hai tu thick
Naa nazron mein aa, naa mujhko tu dikh
Main todoonga dil tera, le kahin tu likh
Baby kisi se bhi poochh, launda too much hai
Boli mein thoda Haryanvi touch hai
Jitne bhi rumour sune tune apni saheliyon se
Mere baare mein woh saare sach hai

Baby main hoon woh
Jiske baare mein
Chetaawani deti hogi tujhe teri maa
Badshah naam badal diyo mera
Baby jo naa kara di teri naa

Sab mujhko dekhein maine
Dekha tujhko bas hai
Sab dhundhla dhundhla laage
Tujhpe hi focus hai
Sab dhundhla dhundhla laage
Tujhpe hai focus!

Naa dikhla tu itni tezi
Karke baatein lazy lazy
Naa dikhla tu itni tezi
Karke baatein lazy lazy
Mujhko khayal kameene naa de, meene naa de

Tera buzz mujhe jeene na de, jeene na de...

Aastha Gill!

It's you boy Badshah!

Tera buzz mujhe jeene na de, jeene na de…

Lyrics: 
Ni kudiye tu alright
Aaja ni re I won't bite
Lage tu mainu sexy
Tahin main jaaga all night

Karave ni tu murder
Oh bhaven hove daylight
Jhakaas teri body
I fell in love at first sight

Kunwariya ton sohni ae te main vi aa kunwara
Chadh di jawani hunn lutt le nazara
Je na mainu karti ni puchna dobara
Fer rotiyan pakayi naale mere gaane gayi

Na ja, na ja. na ja mitran ton door
Ambran ton aayi tu lagdi ae hoor
Att tera nakhra tera ki kasoor
Mainu vi pasand tu kardi zaroor
Na ja, na ja. na ja mitran ton door

Lakk tera hil da ae
Jeve paani de vich hil di supni
Tu ajj mainu roki na
Tere kolon haan kara ke chadh ni

Kunwariya ton sohni ae te main vi aa kunwara
Chadh di jawani hunn lutt le nazara
Je na mainu karti ni puchna dobara
Fer rotiyan pakayi naale mere gaane gayi
Na ja, na ja. na ja mitran ton door
Ambran ton aayi tu lagdi ae hoor

Att tera nakhra tera ki kasoor
Mainu vi pasand tu kardi zaroor
Na ja, na ja. na ja mitran ton door
Ambran ton aayi tu lagdi ae hoor

Att tera nakhra tera ki kasoor
Mainu vi pasand tu kardi zaroor
Girl you look so good
Teri aa nigahwan mainu maar sutteya ae
When you walk my way
Teri aa adawaan mera dil luteya ae
When shake them heels
Tere piche ladke main chadh de saare
Make me crazy.

Take you to paris I'll take you to London
hotel food you could in
Play back your drinks baby i can just fund in
Long as you with me you'll live in abendance
Kunwariya ton sohni ae te main vi aa kunwara

Aaja ni re I won't bite
Lage tu mainu sexy
Tahin main jaaga all night

Ambran ton aayi tu lagdi ae hoor
Att tera nakhra tera ki kasoor
Mainu vi pasand tu kardi zaroor
Na ja, na ja, na ja......

Sohni badi lagdi ae
Jad kurti bhaven kale rang di
Thoda jeha mere nede aa kar

Utte ae lagda nazre sab di
Lakk tera hil da ae
Jeve paani de vich hil di supni
Tu ajj mainu roki na
Tere kolon haan kara ke chadh ni

Kunwariya ton sohni ae te main vi aa kunwara
Chadh di jawani hunn lutt le nazara
Je na mainu karti ni puchna dobara
Fer rotiyan pakayi naale mere gaane gayi
Na ja, na ja. na ja mitran ton door

When you walk my way
Teri aa adawaan mera dil luteya ae
When shake them heels
Tere piche ladke main chadh de saare
Make me crazy.

You talk and I. I like how you talk
Mesmerize by you I don't want you to stop
Baby just tell them you writing for me
Give you the word I won't .

Ambran ton aayi tu lagdi ae hoor
Att tera nakhra tera ki kasoor
Mainu vi pasand tu kardi zaroor
Na ja, na ja. na ja mitran ton door
Ambran ton aayi tu lagdi ae hoor

Att tera nakhra tera ki kasoor
Mainu vi pasand tu kardi zaroor

MQL61B__OIQ,FAKE,Ghost Motorcycle Driving Without Rider in Paris,"Ghost Motorcycle Driving Without Rider in Paris

Footage showed the riderless motorbike driving in a straight line along the A4 outside Paris.

A BIZARRE video of a “ghost motorbike” cruising along a motorway outside Paris with no rider has sparked much confusion among freaked out motorists.

Footage showed the riderless motorbike driving in a straight line, a little too close to the central reservation on the A4 outside Paris.

One driver, who asked his friend to film the surreal scene, said: “On the video, we can clearly see the two-wheeled … without a biker. A ghost.”

But the mystery of the ghost rider may have been solved, with Le Parisien reporting that the motorbike was involved in a collision seconds before.

The rider, who was in his 20s, was knocked off his bike and injured his arm in the crash with another vehicle.

According to reports, the driver of the car picked up the rider and took him to try and find his bike, but there was no trace of it.

The driver then took the motorbike rider to hospital.

Stunt motorcyclist Jean-Pierre Goy, who has appeared in James Bond films, said riderless motorbikes can run for more than 600m, especially with cruise control.

“The pilot may have fallen, and in view of the motorcycle, with a very low centre of gravity, it was possible to continue its journey,” he said.

“I’ve seen motorcycles ride like this even longer, especially with the cruise control blocked.”

VBa4D9D6Gng,FAKE,Lion Takes Revenge On Trophy Hunter!,"#stoptrophyhunting

I managed to get my hands on this video when I was in South Africa a couple of months ago, a hunter showed me and thought it was hilarious.  For me this video highlights a distressing situation that the world needs to see.

Every year trophy hunters kill thousands of exotic wild animals in Africa, this combined with poaching poses a serious threat to the survival of our most loved and endangered species.  We have to stop this now.  Animals are also bred in captivity for the sole purpose of being hunted by tourists who are willing to pay the high price tag, a lion hunt can cost a trophy hunter up to $35'000.

We need to raise awareness around this issue. Please share and save our wildlife.

tIBJqmPsBg4,FAKE,Killer whale kills trainer at Orlando's Sea World:-( -Dawn Brancheau Rip,"The best moments of Dawn Brancheau!!!

A veteran trainer at Orlando's SeaWorld was dragged under water to her death Wednesday in the jaws of Tilikum, the oldest and largest killer whale in captivity, as horrified onlookers watched.

The normally docile orca had killed twice before.

Tourists eating poolside at a daily event called ""Dining With Shamu"" watched the whale drown 40-year-old Dawn Brancheau.

Tourists in an underwater viewing area saw the whale swim by, flipping the bleeding trainer over and over in his mouth.

""It was terrible. It's very difficult to see the image,"" Brazilian tourist Joao Lucio DeCosta Sobrinho, 28, told reporters.

SeaWorld suspended its famous water shows as officials tried to figure out what had happened.

Witnesses described vastly different events: One said Brancheau was patting the whale when he grabbed her arm and dragged her into the water. Another said the big bull orca leaped up out of nowhere and began shaking her.

The whale ""shot up in the air, grabbed the trainer by the waist and started thrashing [her] around,"" witness Victoria Biniak told Orlando's WKMG-TV. ""It was violent.""

Sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said Brancheau slipped and fell into the water with the 30-year-old, 6-ton Tilikum, who is not accustomed to people in his tank.

A number of park visitors said several of the whales had appeared unsettled earlier in the day and were not responding to trainers.

Tilikum, whose name means ""friend"" in the Native American language Chinook, has killed before - always unwittingly.

In 1991, a marine biology student and part-time trainer fell into his tank in Canada and was dragged under by Tilikum. The whale and two females blocked her from getting out of the pool and tossed her back and forth in the air between them like a toy.

In 1999, there was a case so bizarre it made headlines around the world: A man sneaked into Tilikum's pool at SeaWorld and his naked corpse was found the next day splayed on the whale's back.

Experts chalked up both incidents to the orca's misguided attempts at playing. The huge, scary-looking mammals do not generally attack humans.

Brancheau was aware of the dangers posed by the giant marine mammals.

""You can't put yourself in the water unless you trust them and they trust you,"" she told The Orlando Sentinel for a profile published four years ago.

The water park was closed until the weekend. Officials said they did not yet know when the orca show would resume.

""All of our standard operating procedures will be under review,"" park President Dan Brown said.

Experts said they weren't sure what set off the whale.

""What he did in the previous two incidents were not attacks - to him, the people were toys, and to a whale, being under water for 20 minutes is nothing. This sounds a little more like an attack,"" said Naomi Rose, a senior scientist at the Humane Society of the United States.

It was unclear what will happen to Tilikum.

""I dread to think of what they think their options are,"" Rose said.

Brancheau's sister Diana Gross said last night that her sibling ""would not want anything done to that whale.""

""She loved the whales like her children, she loved all of them,"" said Gross, of Indiana.

Rose suggested Tilikum be retired to a sea pen in Iceland, like Keiko, the killer whale Hollywood made famous in 1993's ""Free Willy.""

Rose said such tragedies prove that wild animals should not be kept in pens to perform for tourists. Killer whales are social and intelligent creatures but get stressed in pens, she said.

6411gQdfQwg,FAKE,Исламисты публично обезглавили журналиста из США (новости),"http://ntdtv.ru/ Исламисты публично обезглавили журналиста из США. Публичную казнь американца впервые осуществили исламистские боевики из группировки «Исламское государство Ирака и Леванта». Видео позже было загружено в социальные сети.

Боевики «Исламского государства Ирака и Леванта» обнародовали видео под названием «Послание Америке». На нём, как предполагается, записано обезглавливание американского журналиста Джеймса Фоли. Мужчина пропал в Сирии около двух лет назад. 

Видео загрузили в социальные сети. Подтвердить его достоверность невозможно.

Фоли работал репортёром на Ближнем Востоке в течение пяти лет. Его похитили 22 ноября 2012 года неизвестные вооружённые люди.

Мужчина, стоящий на коленях, которого называют Джеймс Фоли, говорит предсмертное обращение.

[Джеймс Фоли, американский журналист]:
«Я призываю своих родственников и друзей восстать против моих настоящих убийц, правительства США, поскольку то, что произойдёт со мной - это только результат его самонадеянности и преступности».

Белый дом объявил, что разведка уже работает для подтверждения подлинности видео. Ранее боевики группировки не казнили американских граждан публично. Видео было опубликовано после того, как США возобновили авиаудары в Ираке, впервые после окончания оккупации в 2011 году.

Мужчина в маске говорит с британским акцентом.

[член «Исламского государства Ирака и Леванта»]:
«Это Джеймс Райт Фоли, гражданин США, вашей страны. Как правительство вы были на передовой агрессии в отношении Исламского Государства».

После этого на видео показывается, как мужчину обезглавливают. Потом - его тело.

Также боевики показали кадры с ещё одним журналистом, заявив, что его жизнь зависит от действий США в Ираке.

«Исламское государство Ирака и Леванта» - повстанческая группировка суннитского толка. В конце июня 2014 года она объявила на значительных территориях Леванта и Ирака халифат, то есть исламское государство.",3614,412,807600,0.4327544867992401,0.24242855608463287,0.0033724363893270493,0.28255751729011536,0.03730519115924835,0.0015819041291251779

This picks up a few years where the final season left off with Ben and Emma grown up. Mike and Phoebe have trouble with marriage, Monica and Chandler are getting a divorce, Joey couldn't find someone, and Ross and Rachel have trouble after many years of not being together! Filled with some surprise appearances by today's actors, along with some old friends (no pun intended), this movie will be an all-star extravaganza, while showing a lesson in being there for each other.

──────────────────

It's the news we'd all been waiting for and over the weekend, the Friends cast finally revealed they are reuniting for an exclusive, untitled, unscripted special on HBO Max.

Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are officially BACK!

The main stars of “Friends” are going to appear on a reunion special, 16 years after the NBC show came to an end. The unscripted special was originally going to be available at the launch of HBO Max, a new streaming service. But due to production being halted because of the coronavirus, the release date is reportedly unknown.

The friends will gather at the same Warner Bros. studio where they filmed the original series and reminisce about the show.

The actors confirmed the reunion by sharing a photo that was used for their 1995 Rolling Stone cover. The stars will also serve as executive producers and will receive at least $2.5 million each, according to Variety.

The reunion show will not be a new episode of Friends after all these years, nor will this be some kind of remake or reboot. Although the reunion will be shot at the same Warner Bros. soundstage that the series was, this will be an unscripted show, meaning it will probably be more retrospective than revival. The cast will lounge around the old set while clips play, most likely. 

HBO Max will also be the exclusive streaming home for Friends.

Friends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six 20–30-something friends living in Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman, and David Crane.

Here it is!!! The video that broke the internet 7 straight days. The attention was unbelievable when I first posted the clip. Ended-up on 6 TV shows on NBC, Discovery Channel, and MTV! 

I still can’t believe I caught this on camera!!! The McLaren ran the stop sign and make a kid fall off his skateboard. You can hear the skateboard in the video. The passenger of the McLaren yelled something at him and the next thing I heard was a SMASH!  The windshield was completely shattered.

Kid took off running and the passenger ran after him. No idea what ended up happening after the car drove off. I guess the lesson here is DON'T RUN STOP SIGNS!

https://www.cgtn.com/video 

(Viewer discretion advised: some may find this footage disturbing) 

One woman was killed and another injured after a pair of tigers pounced on them at Beijing's Badaling Wildlife Park on Saturday afternoon. 

The tigers attacked one of the women when she left her vehicle and walked a few meters away from the car. The surveillance video footage shows the woman being dragged by the tiger, which prompted the second woman, who later turned out to be her mother,  to rush for help.However, she didn't survive the attack.

While the park allows visitors to drive their own cars in a safari-style tour, they are prohibited to get out as the animals roam freely through the park. But the first woman got out of the car after an alleged argument, putting her life at risk, according to several media reports. 

The park has been closed for the time being. But the weekend attack wasn’t the first. In August 2014, a security guard was killed in a tiger attack at the same park.

j4lVxK8R39g,REAL,California police officer responding to car accident killed by suspected gang member - TomoNews,"WHITTIER, CALIFORNIA — A police officer was killed and a second was injured in a shootout with a suspected gang member in Whittier, California on Monday.

The officers were responding to a traffic accident involving the unnamed suspect, 26, who was driving a stolen car. The suspect had fatally shot another man just hours earlier in East Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reported.

When the officers attempted to pat the alleged gunman down, he opened fire at close range with a semiautomatic pistol.

A shootout ensued, which resulted in the death of officer Keith Boyer, 53, a 27-year veteran of the police force. 

The gunman was also injured, but is expected to survive.

According to police, the alleged gang member was out on parole and had been released from prison early under new laws that aim to reduce incarcerations in California.

a6sG41GDwtA,REAL,Polar bear attack woman in Berlin Germany  هجوم دب قطبي على امراءة,"Polar bear attack woman in Berlin Zoo. BERLIN, April 10 (RIA Novosti) - A woman jumped into a cage with polar bears in the Berlin Zoo on Friday morning, surviving being attacked by one of the bears, local radio reported. 
The incident occurred when zookeepers were feeding the animals, one of whom attacked the intruder. She received bites to her arms and legs, but staff managed to repel the bear, the BB station said. 

The woman was taken to Virchow hospital in Berlin. 
The cause of the incident is being investigated. Police suspect the woman is mentally ill as she ""did not fall into the cage accidentally but jumped there herself."" 
Last December, a man who later described himself as ""lonely"" jumped into the cage of the zoo's most famous polar bear, but emerged unscathed after zookeepers managed to distract Knut with beef. 
The radio said the celebrity bear, who won the sympathy of millions of people from all over the world because he was abandoned by his mother shortly after his birth, was not involved in Friday's incident as he lives in a separate cage. 
A spokesman for the zoo said Knut, now two years and four months old, would never harm a human.

Dos leones sacrificados por incidente de Hombre que se lanzó a la jaula en el Zoológico de Santiago

“Rondaba la jaula y le preguntaba a la gente, qué pasaría si se lanzaba a los leones”, es lo primero que señala Marianela Vargas, sanfelipeña que visitaba junto a sus tres hijos el Zoológico del Parque Metropolitano de Santiago, las circunstancias en que un hombre identificado inicialmente como Franco Ferrada, merodeaba la jaula de los leones al interior del recinto.

“Nunca pensamos que era algo anormal y siempre creímos que se trataba de algún show preparado por el zoológico para la gente que estabamos allí. Solo cuando el hombre se subió a la reja y se desnudó, entendimos que el asunto no era normal”, manifestó la nerviosa madre, que se alejó del lugar con sus hijos para pedir ayuda.

“Cuando sentimos los gritos y que los leones hacían mucho ruido, nos acercamos para ver de qué se trataba, percatándonos de que los leones tomaron al hombre desde el cuello y lo arrastraron hasta el medio de la jaula”, relata Daniela Cáceres, otra sanfelipeña en el lugar.

Ella y su hijo, además del padre de este, visitaban la mañana de este sábado el sector de la jaula de los leones africanos del Zoológico Metropolitano cuando les tocó presenciar el hecho que conmovió a los visitantes al parque.

“Pensamos que se trataba de algún espectáculo, hasta que vimos al personal del zoológico correr y gritar a los leones. En ese momento nos evacuaron, en realidad evacuaron a todas las personas que estaban en el zoológico, incluso en otras partes más distantes. Nos tuvieron afuera por más de media hora hasta que nos hicieron entrar denuevo”, relató Daniela Cáceres.

Personal del recinto, puso en marcha el operativo de emergecia, primero haciendo sonar las sirenas de evacuación y lanzándole agua a los animales.

Tras la salida de los asistentes, procedieron a disparar a la pareja de leones, un macho y una hembra de unos 20 años, provocándole la muerte.

El hombre fue sacado de la jaula y atendido en primera instancia por personal del zoológico, para luego ser trasladado en estado grave hasta la Clínica Indisa, que es el recinto que mantiene convenio con el zoológico.

Dentro de las pertenencias del sujeto se encontró una carta suicida en la que justifica su actuar por razones religiosas, advirtiendo la llegada del apocalipsis.

La directora del recinto calificó el incidente como “lamentable” y aseguró que para el Parque es un hecho de máximo pesar “el tener que haber sacrificado a los leones para salvar la vida a una persona”. De la misma forma aclaró que para estos casos, aplicar anestésicos implicaría esperar unos 4 minutos para que hagan efecto y con ello perder tiempo valioso en la vida de un ser humano en peligro.

Las redes sociales inmediatamente reaccionaron a la noticia adoptando principalmente una postura de rechazo por la muerte de los animales.“Rondaba la jaula y le preguntaba a la gente, qué pasaría si se lanzaba a los leones”, es lo primero que señala Marianela Vargas, sanfelipeña que visitaba junto a sus tres hijos el Zoológico del Parque Metropolitano de Santiago, las circunstancias en que un hombre identificado inicialmente como Franco Ferrada, merodeaba la jaula de los leones al interior del recinto.

wR4QAS9rB7E,REAL,The Day After Tornado Survivors Harrowing Stories,"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Sun was hard to come by in Moore, Oklahoma, Tuesday. The sky still looked menacing, dark and foggy. Mist turned to rain. Lightning struck.

From the air, this suburb outside Oklahoma City looked like flattened cardboard. On the ground, homes were messes of splinters. Cars, thrown like toys, sat in ridiculous places. Hunks of steel hung in trees -- the trees that were left. Most were shaved down to gnarly apocalyptic wishbones.

When people were allowed back on their street -- if emergency crews gave them the green light -- that's when the real trauma set in for many.

It's bizarre and disorienting when every landmark and sign your eye knows is suddenly gone and there's miles of nothing in its place.

""It's funny when you can't tell your own stuff when you get back and look at it like this,"" Mack James said, standing in the rubble that used to be his house.



Moore has no power. Water is out and volunteers are handing out bottles. The twister is gone but the danger is still real.

Gas lines are being checked. Crews are out searching for live wires.

""It was horrible,"" recalled one elderly woman, sitting in a chair near piles of debris. ""The thunder and the sound was like a turning of the world. It was so bad but we were in the cellar right out there. You could hear the thing just blowin', hear the pounding.

""I can't even believe I'm still alive.""

The realization of the loss of material things is just beginning. Photos are gone. Family heirlooms might not ever be found.

How to help

But there is worse. Rescue workers are still trying to find survivors, as reports keep coming in about those missing.

Wearing a thick red hoodie, Zack Woodcock looked intensely worried and lost in thought as he told a CNN reporter that a wrestler on his son's wrestling team was missing.

""It's hard,"" he muttered, looking like he hasn't been to sleep.

The death toll, as of 2 p.m.. ET, is 24, according to Oklahoma City Medical Examiner spokeswoman Amy Elliott. Nine of the dead are children, she said.

Frantic kids and parents

On Monday evening, kids screamed for their parents and parents hollered their children's names, walking and searching in panic in a parking lot near Briarwood Elementary.

""Caleb! Caleb!"" one woman could be heard screaming, as another woman, her face bloody, walked zombie-like through the crowd, holding a young boy's hand.

""Step over the wire!"" someone shouted. Adults and children zigzagged past each other. One man went to a little boy standing alone, whose face was just then cracking into a full-out cry. The man put his arm around the child and they both looked out into the chaotic parking lot, apparently searching for the boy's parents.

One mother who spotted her son sitting with his teacher on a curb gently grabbed the boy's hands and stood him up and then learned her whole body over him, hugging him. She cried and then laughed and cupped his face.

""He was so brave!"" the teacher said.

The mother then embraced the teacher. ""Thank you,"" she wept, ""thank you.""

Another man who appeared to be a teacher held his arm up and shouted, ""5th graders!"" But, of course, parents and kids continued to wander, desperate, scared. It was a valiant effort though -- trying to offer order where none could be found.

A teacher saves her students

Incredibly, everyone at Briarwood made it out alive.

Monday afternoon, second-grade teacher Tammy Glasgow was in her classroom when her husband shot her a text: ""Storms are coming. Be careful.""

She tried to text back but her phone was out, and she couldn't pull up websites to check the news.

Something had felt off for awhile that morning, Glasgow said. She knew the area. She knew what that could mean.

""It was kinda ominous, real humid, just had a bad feeling,"" she said, walking with a CNN reporter on the school grounds now crowded with twisted metal, rebar and piles of concrete blocks. A bright yellow playground set stood out amid the gray.

Glasgow said that just before the twister hit, she went to the window. The kids were singing the National Anthem.

""You could just see it,"" she said.

An announcement came on the loudspeaker to get to a safe place.

She quickly hustled 12 girls into a girls' bathroom. A worried father who'd already shown up to the school helped get boys into the boys' bathroom. Another teacher, a counselor and three other kids got in a closet, Glasgow said.

""Before I shut the doors [to the boys' bathroom], I said, 'I'm gonna shut these doors. I love you.'"" The boys looked at me a little strange.""

Glasgow's own son was in the bathroom. She looked at him for a moment.

""I just said, 'Watch over them. Take care of them.'""

Then she told the girls she loved them.

""We love you back!"" they chimed.",56,7,12450,0.9989609718322754,0.00024362195108551532,0.0002440021198708564,0.00024130800738930702,0.00016099111235234886,0.0001490814029239118

4mD1qG0c1dE,REAL,Whale Fish washed on the Juhu Beach Shore Mumbai INDIA,"Whale Fish Washed Up on Juhu Beach Shore 
28th January 2016 Mumbai (INDIA), Late night some people spotted a huge fish in the high tide water. Morning on 29th Jan people saw huge 40 feet whale fish washed on the juhu beach shore. Thousands of people gathered to see the dead whale fish, national media reached the spot and LIVE news was flashed on Indias most of the channels. Lifeguards and Police was called to mantain law and orders on the beach. Police and lifeguards keep people away from the fish as to keep people safe from any viral infection if fish cascare had carried.
While this whale shark may be huge and rarely seen, it joins many other sea creatures that have unfortunately been washed up on the beaches. Some of the deaths of these animals may be a mystery, but many can be related back to drought and humans.A study by Baylor University showed that drought conditions not only affect water levels, but also water quality. Chemicals, like ammonia, can be more toxic during drought conditions. The study found that when pH levels shift, ammonia in the water can become toxic and affect the fish.According from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 80 percent of pollution to marine life comes from the land. Non point source pollution is the largest cause, which includes septic tanks, cars, trucks, and boats. Farms, ranches, and forest area also contribute to the nonpoint pollution. Oil pollution is also a large killer of sea life. Rough seas spread the oil through the marine environment, as well as to the fish or birds that eat an oil-poisoned animal. 
late in the evening the cascara of whale was berried on the shore of Mora village which is end of Silver beach.",2280,93,3147652,0.9764328598976135,0.0008467136649414897,0.0004788638325408101,0.021336501464247704,0.0006465793121606112,0.0002585354377515614

This chilling video captures the moment a man flirted with disaster as a fighter jet flew just a few feet over his head at extreme speed.
The incredibly low fly-by, coupled with the man's game of chicken, may be one of the most dangerous stunts of all time.
Footage shows the Free Libyan Air Force plane appearing to emerge out of thin air as it flew just off the ground.

SLMa5-n2OVc,REAL,Grizzly Bear Charge in Jasper,"While mountain biking in Jasper, Alberta on August 4, 2013, my cousin Dan and I were charged by a grizzly sow three times. 

We were riding single track just outside of Jasper town-site (9c) when the encounter occurred. I rode to the top of a hill and applied the brakes to wait for Dan and plan my descent. My brakes squealed a bit, then I heard a growl and looked to my right to see a grizzly bear charging at me.

After careening down the hill a bit on my bike, I was able to distance myself from the bear. According to Dan, who was subsequently charged, the sow stopped on the trail where I had been standing.

When Dan arrived on the scene, he created a distraction, which drew the bear to him. He managed to grab the bear spray from his bag in time to brace himself, but the bear stopped approximately 10 meters from him - just outside the spray's effective range. Frankly, I'm glad we didn't have to injure the mother in any way.

Meanwhile, I worked my way along the bottom of the gully toward Dan so that I wasn't alone in the rough bush. As I reached him, the sow and her cub charged toward us slightly once more before heading away in the direction that we had come from.

We waited a few minutes, then walked away from the scene along the trail with bear spray in hand.

Surveillance cameras in Shandong Jiaotong University recorded two children accidentally falling into a pond, and after struggling for two minutes in the water, both of them were successfully saved by a security guard, who arrived after seeing them floating in the pond through his monitors. According to staff from the university, the security guard also didn’t know how to swim, which made his decision to jump into the water even more heroic. 
 
More than 160 people drown every day in China, and drowning is the leading cause of death among children aged 5 to 14, according to estimates released by the World Health Organization in 2014.

Bush cracks joke to Obama while Clinton makes a speech
A few years ago, I had attended a conference where W was the keynote speaker. During his presidency, I was totally against him and did not like him one bit. In person, as he sat on stage and engaging with the moderator, he was personable and not the buffoon that we often saw with his Bushisms. He was great, funny and someone who I'd love to have a few beers with. After seeing him, I purchased his book.
Quite often former presidents become close friends with other former presidents, even when they're of different parties and politically polar opposites of each other. Seeing photos of the Obama's and Bush's show that they're genuinely fond of each other and are quite close.

""My name is Cody Kunau and I am a fishing guide for the Yakutat Lodge based in Yakutat Alaska. On July 2nd, my friend Samantha and I were driving to the lodge for dinner when we encountered a bear far ahead in the road. This is a somewhat normal occurrence for here. Usually, the bears run off and catching a close up glimpse is hard. We slowed our vehicle down to where we saw the bear cross the road when suddenly it erupted from the bushes and came after our vehicle. After this incident, we turned back around to see what was making the bear so agitated. We could see no cubs, no kill, or anything that would make this bear behave the way it did. It charged us again so we went to the lodge to warn everyone of the incident. This is a popular road in town located maybe 500 yards from the lodge so we wanted to let people know not to walk or bike there. In the rear view mirror we witnessed the bear also chase another vehicle that passed by after us without the occupants even knowing They were heading to our lodge for dinner too.Even though I was in a car, it was one of the scariest moments of my life!""

N.Korea defector regains consciousness, video shows getaway under fire - Reuters

22-Nov-2017 12:06:38

Adds details on defector's condition

By Haejin Choi and Josh Smith

SEOUL, Nov 22 (Reuters) - North Korean border guards were only steps behind a North Korean soldier when they opened fire and one briefly crossed the border pursuing the wounded defector as he dashed to the South Korean side, a video released on Wednesday by the U.N. Command (UNC) in Seoul showed.

The defecting soldier, whose rank and identity have not been disclosed, was critically wounded, having been hit five or six times in the hail of bullets as he made his desperate escape on Nov.13. He was flown by a U.S. military helicopter to a hospital in Suwon, south of Seoul.

Doctors announced on Wednesday that he had regained consciousness, having had two operations to extract the bullets, and his breathing was stable and unassisted.

""He is fine,"" lead surgeon Lee Cook-Jong said at a press conference in Suwon. ""He is not going to die.""

An official from U.N. Command (UNC) said North Korea had been informed on Wednesday that it had violated the 1953 armistice agreement, which marked the cessation of hostilities in the Korean War.

The UNC official told a news conference that a soldier from the North Korean People's Army (KPA) had crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), the border between the two Koreas, for a few seconds as others fired shots at the defecting soldier.

“The key findings of the special investigation team are that the KPA violated the armistice agreement by one, firing weapons across the MDL, and two, by actually crossing the MDL temporarily,” Chad Carroll, Director of Public Affairs for the UNC, told reporters.

The dramatic video showed a military vehicle speeding toward the border, passing checkpoints manned by North Korean guards before appearing to get stuck in a ditch.

North Korean soldiers were only a few metres away when the defector jumped from the vehicle and fled on foot, scrambling up slightly rising ground to cross the border.

Moments after this a handful of North Korean soldiers are seen running to toward the abandoned vehicle and stopping to open fire, though one appears to briefly cross the dividing line between the two countries before turning around.

The video does not show the moment when the defector was hit, but he is seen lying motionless next to a concrete wall in one of the later edited clips in the video.

Three South Korean troops, including the deputy commander of the border security unit, are seen crawling through undergrowth to drag the wounded North Korean to safety.

Doctors conducted a series of surgeries on the critically wounded soldier, and now say they believe he will recover, despite continued risks of infection.

""Patient requires intensive care, detailed tests and observation as there is a chance his condition may worsen due to infections of his bullet wounds,"" the hospital said in a statement.

The soldier show signs of depression and possible trauma, in addition to a serious case of parasites that has complicated his treatment, the hospital said.",12088,2601,3406858,0.02488183043897152,0.0030772362370043993,0.0014316962333396077,0.0061877272091805935,0.9090921878814697,0.055329304188489914

o0niNWGbTuE,FAKE,Bollywood Actors Are Facing Contract Issue with Big Brands,"Bollywood is not as before now. It has changed a lot, especially after the tragic incident that took place in Bandra on 14th of June. Along with the perception of Bollywood fans, the brands and big marketing companies are viewing Bollywood actors from different eyes, they have never seen from before. This big marketing companies and brands are being pressurized not to choose Bollywood actors as their brand ambassador. And this pressure from the fans is turning out to reality. Seven big brands are set not to renew the contract with the Bollywood actors. Instead, they are set to choose the TV actors as their brand ambassador. According to reports, the company and brands are doing this due to the intense pressure and widespread hatred towards the Nepotism culture in Bollywood.
 
Sushant Singh Rajput's passing became the door for the public to learn about Bollywood dark culture and secrets. Nepotism debate was there, and it existed for a long time, but Sushant's loss made this debate more vital than ever. And Bollywood fans knew about the real face of the Bollywood stars. Even lately, Rhea Chakraborty's drug case is revealing the drug culture in Bollywood.
 
If this goes on, the Bollywood industry is going to bear a huge loss. This would be a perfect lesson for those Bollywood actors, who never use to count on their fans. Recently also we can see that Mahesh Bhatt's Sadak 2 movie, starring Alia Bhatt has to bear a huge loss as well as it got a huge criticism. Along with that, it's trailer video on YouTube became the 2nd most disliked video with 13 Million dislikes.
 
All this was possible due to the fans of Sushant Singh Rajput, who were continually holding this topic for the justice. May the justice will prevail.

uLz8_6x8u2Q,FAKE,Plastic Surgery से पहले और बाद की 10 बॉलीवुड अभिनेत्रियाँ | 10 Actresses Before and After Surgery,"The plastic surgery bug has bitten almost every actress in Hollywood and Bollywood. Here is a look at 10 popular Bollywood actresses before and after they underwent plastic surgery.
First up is Rakhi Sawant. The former Bollywood item queen and reality TV star went under the knife several times for various procedures that included breast implants, liposuction, and even a nose job. These left her looking like her face is make of plastic. Next is Anushka Sharma. The actress never confirmed reports of going under the knife but pictures soon began to surface of her looking drastically different. This led some to suspect that she had a lip job done. Next is Ayesha Takia. Fans suspect that she had Botox and a lip job that robbed her of her original wholesome features and left her with an ice-cold look. 

Next is Sridevi. The late Bollywood actress was in the limelight for her noticeable nose job that completely altered her physical features. Yet, Sridevi did not let her plastic surgery get the better of her and always conducted herself with a lot of grace. Also on this list is Karishma Kapoor. Inspite of her beauty, this National Award winner too decided to go under the knife to enhance her looks. She is one of the few examples of stars whose looks were actually enhanced by plastic surgery. Koena Mitra became the victim of a botched-up nose job that cost her a fortune in corrective surgery. Yet, unlike most other actresses, Koena has openly spoken about getting surgery done. 

One of Bollywood’s classic beauties Hema Malini has had Botox injections for years to fight signs of aging. Years of treatment seem to have finally taken a toll on this former heroine. Her face appears so stiff when she speaks that she can no longer smile. Actress Vaani Kapoor’s face developed sharp angles even as her lips seemed plumper after she allegedly had plastic surgery done before her 2016 film Befikre. She denied all rumours. Former Miss World and currently Mrs Jonas, Priyanka Chopra has had a lot of plastic surgery done to her face over the years including a suspected lip job and nose job. While the actress herself has never confirmed the rumours, many publications have run before and after pictures of the star that show how her facial features have been modified.

KXofTl_kj8U,FAKE,Dark Secrets of Karan Johar | You Never Know,"Unknown secrets of Karan Johar that no one knows :- 

Love affair :- Everyone in Bollywood knows that Karan has an unusual weakness towards male actors and models, and he is gay.  He used to receive many hate mails and comments on his twitter handle for being gay. People call him hypocrite for not admitting that he is a gay.  Rumor is that he was allegedly in a relationship with Bollywood’s famous fashion designer Manish Malhotra.  Rumor is Karan is now in long-distance relationship with his foreign boyfriend.  From Karan’s autobiography, we get to know that for many years there were rumors about Karan and Shahrukh Khan's unusual relationship.    Karan also has a particular weakness for Pakistani actor Fawad Khan and he was heartbroken when Fawad got banned from Bollywood. 

Father of Nepotism in bollywood :- Karan Johar is related to two wealthy and influential families in Bollywood.  Aditya Chopra’s father, Yash Chopra is Karan’s uncle. Karan’s father Yash Johar is also a famous producer in Bollywood. Being the son of Yash Johar, Karan grabbed Bollywood's attention quickly since the 90s. Day by day he became the leader  of a big bollywood gang There is no doubt that he is very much obsessed with star kids and A-grade actors and actresses.  In an interview, Karan proudly confessed that he only wants to work with star kids, and that is his personal choice. He doesn’t care how talented anyone is, he will only launch star kids under his production house. Karan is now getting slammed in all social media because of spreading nepotism in Bollywood.  Kangana even gave him the ultimate tag for promoting nepotism in Bollywood and that is “The flag bearer of Nepotism”. Many people troll him for mocking and bullying talented outsiders like Sushant Singh Rajput and Kangana Ranaut.  Karan is now blamed for harassing the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput for ruining his professional life. 

Hatred for Outsider :- Karan hates to work with outsiders, and his manager confessed the truth. Recently, talented actor Ayushamnn Khurrana shared his own pathetic experience to work with Karan Johar . He stated that when he called Karan Johar’s landline number, his manager picked it up and told that Karan doesn’t work with outsiders like Ayushmann. Karan only launched some dumb star kids like Alia Bhatt, Ananya Panday etc . Most shockingly, these star kids won best debut male and female awards in the platform ofIIFA and Filmfare. If you are wondering why then here is the answer. In most of these award panels, Karan is one of the influential jury members.  Karan makes sure that only star kids get those awards, not anyone else.  For this reason, Ananya Panday got her debut award in 2020, not a promising outsider like Shivaleeka Oberoi, whose acting is much appreciated among the audience. Karan is now blamed for ruining another immensely talented actor Sushant Singh Rajput broken career.  According to reports, Karan is the one who banned Sushant from his Dharma production and shelved Sushant from his upcoming projects.  Due to severe depression, talented actor Sushant took his own life on 14 June 2020. 

Fatherhood  :- Unmarried Karan welcomed his two kids- Roohi and Yash, via surrogacy in 2017.  Rumor is Karan is co-parenting his kids with his distant boyfriend.

Recently, the Bollywood actress posted a beautiful picture of herself on the internet. On 1st of February, the actress posted a picture of herself where she was beaming with her radiant smile. The actress used just one word as a caption of her image and that was “February”. Her fans just loved the smiling image of the actress too much and many fans wished the actress a happy February. Her husband, Ranveer Singh could not keep his calm too and comment on her radiant smile. But amidst all this, a conjecture came forward from the comment section of this post. Few fans of the actress made an assumption after seeing the image. One user asked the actress if she is pregnant or not, as the actress seemed to be very happy. Once the speculation came, there was no stopping of these assumptions. Several users started asking the actress if she and Ranveer is expecting their first child or not. One user even wrote that Deepika is finishing all of her prior commitments fast as she will take leave for pregnancy. So do you think the hot couple of Bollywood, Deepika and Ranveer will soon become parents too?

nGDVMIwGi54,FAKE,Bachchan Family Forcing Aishwarya to Take Another Baby ?,"Abhishek Bachchan Wanted Two Kids with Aishwarya Rai. Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai’s pair is one of the most powerful couples in B Town. This couple looks very happy whenever they are in public but looks like there are not that much happy in real life. Let us find out in the video, what made the couple has differences in their conjugal life. After having controversial relationships with actors like Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi, Aishwarya decided to get married. Beauty queen Aishwarya got married with Abhishek on 20th of April, in the year 2007. The couple welcomed their first child, their daughter Aradhya, in the year 2011. Aradhya is the apple of the eye of the Bachchan family. She is her grandparents’ favourite. Big B loves her granddaughter, Aradhya a lot and he always pampers her too much. Abhishek also loves her little daughter a lot and he even gifted her an expensive car on her first birthday. But in spite of being happy, Abhishek and Aishwarya had a fall out among them because of their family planning. Well, Abhishek has always expressed that he wanted to have two kids. In an old video of the actor, Abhishek was seen saying that he wants to have two kids. When he was asked the reason, the actor replied that he himself grew up with his sibling, Shweta Bachcchan.  That is why he also wants his kids to be grown up with sibling. But Bollywood actress Aishwarya is not interested in having two babies. She is happy with their one and only daughter. Because of this, the two stars had a huge fall out. Aishwarya does not want to be a mother again. As per the reports, Aishwarya Rai is very much concerned about her looks and physical appearance. She wants to pursue her Bollywood career just like before but if she becomes pregnant then it would not be possible for her to continue acting. According to sources, close to the Bachchan family revealed that Aishwarya said that she has worked really hard to get in shape post pregnancy. It would be tough for her to that again. So she does not want a second child. Aishwarya also added that, their daughter Aradhya always gets trolled by people, which is another reason for her decision. Reports suggested that, this decision of Aishwarya has offended her mother and father in law. Big B and Jaya Bachchan both wanted to have another grandchild in their life just like their son’s wish. But because of Aishwarya’s decision, it would be impossible for them to see their wish getting fulfilled. Jaya Bachchan, because of this decision of Aishwarya, is really disappointed on her. Shweta Bachchan also does not like the decision of her sister in law. This is also one of the reasons of why Jaya and Shweta share cold relationship with Aishwarya.

i1rlytoxQ1o,FAKE,Dark Secrets of Bachchan Family,"Dirty Secrets of the Bachchan Family. Do you know about Shweta Bachchan’s divorce? Many people may not know, that Shweta Bachchan is now divorced and she stays with her parents permanently. Yes, Shweta has been living separately from her husband Nikhil Nanda for last few years. But Bachchan family has never made this news official as this can affect their public image. Disturbed relationship between mother and daughter. Jaya Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan appear in public together with happy smile but in real life they don’t share good bonding. Shweta had to get married only at the age of 21 because of her mother but her married life was never been happy. So, Shweta consider her mother responsible for her divorce and unhappy married life. Do you know about the connection between Amitabh Bachchan and B-grade film? In 2003, Amitabh Bachchan did a B-grade film named ‘Boom’. Don’t get shocked as it’s true. He did the film for money only because he was going through a financial crisis at that time. Now let’s discuss about the cold war between nanad and bhabi. Shweta Bachchan and Aishwarya don’t even talk to each other properly and they avoid each other in public also. Actually Shweta is very close to Abhishek’s ex-girlfriend Karishma and she never accepts Aishwarya as the Bachchan bahu. Do we know about the hatred between Jaya Bachchan  and Aishwarya? Aishawarya was never the first choice to Jaya for Abhishek. Jaya wanted Rani Mukherjee as the perfect Bachchan Bahu.

Side by side, the Jaya Bachchan is always jealous of the extreme popularity of Aishwarya. So, she never became that much close to Aishwarya. There is another dirtiest thing in Bachchan family. This is the worst one. 

According to rumours, Bahu Aishwarya was romantically involved with Amitabh Bachchan. That’s why everyone in the family hates Aishwarya. We don’t know whether it’s true or just a rumour. Next on the list is Aishwarya’s downfall of career after marriage. Aishwarya always wanted to come back in bollywood after marriage but she was not able to do that only for Bachchan family. Bachchan family always inspire their daughter to start her career now but they have problem with Aishwarya’s comeback in bollywood. Now the last one  is Navya Naveli Nanda’s love affairs and arrogant lifestyle. The granddaughter of Bachchan family already made headlines with her many love affairs. Navya was once dating Shah Rukh’s son Aryan and the Bachchans were not happy. Then she got engaged with Meezan Jaffrey. She also leads an arrogant lifestyle. Most of the time she gets busy with party, alcohol and vacations with boyfriends

oElP9uf2he4,FAKE,Mr. India 2 | 30 Interesting Facts  | Anil Kapoor | Bonny Kapoor | Kay Kay menon | janhvi Kapoor,"Mr. India is a 1987 Indian Hindi-language superhero film directed by Shekhar Kapur, based on a screenplay written by Salim–Javed. It stars Sridevi and Anil Kapoor in the lead roles. Amrish Puri, Ashok Kumar, Satish Kaushik, Ajit Vachani and Sharat Saxena are featured in supporting roles.

The film was the Highest-grossing Indian film of 1987 and remains a cult classic in India.[4] The film was known for several of its lines and songs, including Sridevi's ""Miss Hawa Hawaii"" performance, and Amrish Puri's quote ""Mogambo khush hua"" 

Zee Studios had announced that they have signed Ali Abbas Zafar to helm a trilogy: Mr India, based on the 1987 Shekhar Kapur-directed movie, which featured Anil Kapoor as Mr India and late Sridevi as a journalist. Ever since the announcement of the Mr India reboot has been made official by the makers, Shekhar has been up and about expressing his displeasure over the project. Now, when speculations are rife that Shah Rukh Khan had done a test shoot for the iconic role of Mogambo in Mr India reboot, Shekhar has hit back on Twitter again saying that he does not believe that anyone can take on the iconic role of the villain essayed by late Amrish Puri in the original film.

DqNtfTEaj-Q,FAKE,Shocking Sad News For Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor Marriage,"All Is Not Well Between Alia & Ranbir. One of the most anticipated marriages of this year is the marriage of Alia and Ranbir. But looks like, everything is not well between these love birds. Well recently there were reports doing rounds that Ranbir and Alia will get married after the release of their first movie together Brahmastra. The reports suggested that their family members have already invited their relatives and told them to be free on those dates. It is also said that, both the families have started preparing for the marriage. Reports also said that Alia has already ordered her lehenga to Sabhyasachi. There were also reports suggesting that they have selected their honeymoon destination. But just after few days of these reports coming in limelight, news also started doing round that everything is not well between these two love birds. Both these stars have finished filming for Brahmastra and currently they are busy with their next projects. Alia is currently shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Gangubai Kathiawadi and Ranbir has started shooting for his next movie Shamshera. It is also said that both these stars are also shooting their respective films at the same film studio but the sets are different. But what is surprising that they are not meeting each other, in spite of being at the same studio. This incident is quite surprising because Alia and Ranbir always accompany each other wherever they go. Even Alia accompanied Ranbir, when he visited his ill father Rishi Kapoor at a hospital of New Delhi. They even attended Armaan Jain’s wedding together and Alia was many times spotted with Ranbir’s mother Neetu Kapoor too. But what happened now that they are maintaining distance from each other? There are many questions coming in the limelight right now that if Ranbir has dumped Alia or if Alia cheated on Ranbir. Many people are also thinking that their relationship was just a publicity stunt. They were pretending to be in a relationship just to promote the business of their movie. But nothing has been confirmed now from their side. Many people are also assuming that they are keeping their personal and professional life separate.And by being professional they are not meeting each other on the sets of their movies.We hope that this adorable couple does not part their ways.

dxLJOdr6Xdo,FAKE,Robot 3.0 | 31 Interesting Facts  | Rajinikanth | Disha Patani | Aishwarya | Amy Jackson | S.Shankar,"#RajiniKanth #TigerShroff #Robot3

Director Shankar's dream project 2.0 is all geared up to hit the theatres worldwide on November 29. The sci-fi film is a sequel to the director's Endhiran, which released in 2010. 

The trailer launch of 2.0 took place at a private theatre in Chennai. At the event, host RJ Balaji asked Shankar whether there might be a sequel to 2.0.

The director revealed, ""3.0 might come in future. I have a few fresh ideas for 2.0's sequel. If I am able to pen down a worthy script, then there might be a 3.0 for sure. Let's see.""

Shankar also promised that there are plenty of surprises in 2.0. ""In the film, you will watch Rajinikanth as Vaseegaran, Chitti, 2.0 and even as giant Chitti. There are more surprises in the film,"" he revealed.

2.0 stars Rajinikanth, Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson in the lead roles.2.0, the Rajinikanth movie, as the name suggests is packed with entertainment. Rajinikanth has a mild entrance scene in 2.0 but he more than makes it up with some whistle and clap-worthy sequences. He does what he does best by thoroughly entertaining the audiences. The film rekindles his flamboyant style. Amy Jackson plays a female humanoid robot. Her USP is that she is learning about what modern humans do, especially some funny references to film and TV. Akshay Kumar delivers an ultimate performance as the saviour of his Avian friends.

Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt. Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.

Sanju is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “did this really happen?” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.

Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani. 
 
Directed by: Rajkumar Hirani. 
 
Produced by: Vinod Chopra Films and Rajkumar Hirani Films in association with Fox Star Studios.

Actor Prabhas, known for his strong acting in South Industry, has worked in more than one film in his career, but among them ""Bahubal series is considered a successful film of his career"".
Based on the action adventure, 2 parts of this film have been made so far and both the text has been liked by the audience and made them super hit.

The second part of this series came last in the year 2017, after which people started demanding for Bahubali 3 fiercely, but till now Prabhas and the producer of this film did not say anything but friends do you know that your wait is now  It is over because the makers of the Bahubali franchise are going to bring Bahubali 3 soon if news is to be believed.

In our video of today, we are going to give you information about Bahubali 3, which will be the star cast and how long will the film come in ???? If you also want to know all these things related to Bahubali 3, then stay with us till the end of this video and you should not forget to like our video for the superhit film Bahubali series.

The ""Baahubali franchise"" is an important part of Prabhas' career, whose first film ""Baahubali"" came out in the year 2015, in which he played the main role of Shivadu and he had a girlfriend in the lead role with ""Tamannaah Bhatia"" and in the supporting role ""  Many actors like Anushka Shetty "","" Ramya Krishnan ""were seen and Veelaan was in the role of"" Rana Daggubati ""who played Bhallaldev.

The story of this film was liked by the audience so much that the film proved to be a super duper hit and the film had grossed around 650 crores.  In view of this spectacular earning, director SS Rajamouli made the second part of it which was released in the year 2017, which was named ""Bahubali Conclusion"".

In this film, Prabhas Man was in the lead but this time it was in the role of Baahubali, the son of Shivadu's son, this time with whom he was seen as ""Anushka Shetty"" as his girlfriend and mother was his ""Ramya Krishnan"" and Villain.  The role had ""Rana Dagguvati"" as before.

Like the previous time, this film also got a lot of love and the film proved to be a super hit by earning 250 crores. Since this film, the audience started demanding Bahubali 3 and according to the news, according to this growing demand, the film's producer Shobu Yerlagadda and director SS Rajamouli are coming soon with Bahubali 3.

This was revealed when in an interview with journalist Rajeev Masand, Prabhas had said something about the film ""Bahubali 3"" which makes sure that Part 3 of Bahubali is going to be made soon. When Rajiv Masand asked the effect whether Rajamouli would make the third part of Bahubali, Prabhas said that for this he would have to be a little excited. He had already heard me 6 scripts when he was making Bahubali earlier, maybe he has at least  At least 14 to 15 scripts.

By ""Baahubali 2"" we have finished only 60%, I know that the script of ""Baahubali 3"" has been ready in Rajamouli's mind for the last 5 years but I do not know when Rajamouli will start part 3 of Bahubali.  .

Friends, Prabhas is clear from this statement that Rajamouli already has the script of ""Bahubali 3"", but now when he will be released, only Rajamouli can tell it but as far as the first two films of Bahubali are seen, his  The above was also worked in a very secret way, even if no information about these films was available from anywhere, then we doubt if Rajamouli was quietly engaged in preparing for ""Bahubali 3"", and one  Day will suddenly explode that ""Bahubali 3"" is coming to theaters soon!

Shankar also promised that there are plenty of surprises in 2.0. ""In the film, you will watch Rajinikanth as Vaseegaran, Chitti, 2.0 and even as giant Chitti. There are more surprises in the film,"" he revealed.

Rajinikanth has a mild entrance scene in 2.0 but he more than makes it up with some whistle and clap-worthy sequences. He does what he does best by thoroughly entertaining the audiences. The film rekindles his flamboyant style. Amy Jackson plays a female humanoid robot. Her USP is that she is learning about what modern humans do, especially some funny references to film and TV.

7cSUaMVq2nM,FAKE,Bollywood Stars Career Destroyed By Karan Johar,"These are the Careers Of Bollywood Stars Destroyed By Karan Johar. Karan Johar is one of the most celebrated directors and producers of the film industry. He has launched many stars in Bollywood but most of them are star kids. So, he is given the title of ‘flag bearer of nepotism’. Because of his fondness towards star kids only, Karan has tried to destroy the career of many Bollywood stars who are quite successful now.

1. Anushka Sharma :- Karan Johar himself admitted during a press conference with Rajeev Masand that KJo tried hard to sabotage Anushka’s career. Karan never wanted Aditya Chopra to cast Anushka Sharma in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. When Aditya showed him Anushka’s image, KJo rejected her. Karan hated Anushka’s look and hesitantly watched Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi but later he casted her in her movie Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.

2. Sushant Singh Rajput :- One of the extremely talented actors of Bollywood, Sushant Singh Rajput ‘s career was also manipulated by Karan Johar. Because of Sushant’s fall out with a producer, many big production houses of Bollywood, including Karan Johar banned him. Which is why the actor lost all the projects in his hand and was left with no work; and he decided to take his own life.

3. Ayushmann Khurrana :- One of the most sought after actor of Bollywood. Ayushmann Khurrana was once neglected and rejected by Karan Johar. Ayushmann himself confessed that when he was hosting a show, he asked Karan for work. Karan gave him a landline number. When he called, a staff of Dharma Production said that they only work with stars and he would not get work there.

4. Priyanka Chopra :- Priyanka is a global icon now but there was a time when Karan Johar tried to ban Priyanka Chopra from Bollywood. Everybody knows about the Shah Rukh Khan’s affair with Priyanka Chopra which created a lot buzz in B Town. Gauri along with her friends from industry with help of Karan Johar decided to ban Priyanka in Bollywood but ultimately failed.

5. Kangana Ranaut :- Kangana is one of the most out spoken actresses in Bollywood and she has always blamed Karan for nepotism in industry. Kangana humiliated Karan Johar for showing attitude towards her and for nepotism, on Karan’s own talk show. Karan tried really hard to sabotage the shining career of Kangana Ranaut, but he failed to end the career of the ‘queen’.

KrMII3Y0UJc,FAKE,why Divorce is Very Common in Kajol's Life,"Bollywood actress Kajol recently did a Netflix movie named Tribhanga, which also stars Mithila Palkar, Tanvi Azmi.

WErNBLqdLrY,FAKE,Secret Divorce Reason of Imran Khan and Avantika,"The Reason of Imraan and Avantika’s Divorce. Reports of Imran Khan and Avantika Malik separation have hit the bollywood for several months and rumor of their divorce already made headlines. Due to growing differences between them, Avantika left the house with her daughter and staying with her parents. Both of them never answered the question being asked about their separation and their silence says it all. But why this cute married couple has got divorced? Everyone is curious to know the reason of their separation and finally the reason is there in the news. Imran and Avantika married to each other in a fairytale wedding ceremony and they have a cute daughter Imaara. But the Imran’s failed career is one of the major reasons of the daily fight between this loved couple. The issue came into limelight when Avantika removed her surname “Khan” from his name . Imran Khan is unable to establish himself in bollywood and it’s been more than four years he is sitting at home with no job. His last movie ""Katti Batti"" didn’t get much audience attention and was flop. He is getting no film offers since his last film. Avantika’s mother also accepted the differences between the couple but she dismissed the fact that they are getting divorced. Report says that Imran wants to be a film director but the things did not go well and he end up with no film to direct. According to report, the savings of Imran came to an end and Avantika has to rely on her parents’ money for their expenses. Because of failed career and lack of money, Imran turned short tempered resulting in quarrel among the two.For that reason their house has become place of regular arguments which ended up after separation. Earlier we saw many bollywood divorces because of failed career and financial issues. Maliaka Arora got separated from Arbaaz Khan because of his flop bollywood career and financial crisis. According to report, Avantika has joined wellness clinic to cope of with her separation, which proves she is dealing with a tough time. Avantika who was always a strong supporter of Imran, now ended up with separation because of his Imran’s flop career. Imran started his career with a hit film “Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na” and got lot of appreciation for his acting skill. After that he got plenty of film offers to prove himself but every time he failed to impress the audiences. All the filmmakers stopped working with him and Imran is also not ready to do any supporting role. Now, we will wait and watch wheather this couple will get back together or they completely call their marriage off.

h2mecvSfT8w,FAKE,Why Salman Khan Hate Amitabh Bachchan So Much,"Does the bhaijaan of Bollywood hate the veteran actor of Bollywood, Big B?Why this question? Because Salman Khan does not like to get compared with the veteran actor. The current reports are suggesting that Salman Khan gets very angry when someone compares him the bhaijaan. What had happened that Salman Khan gets angry whenever someone compares him Big B? Salman Khan’s style is very unique and no other star has the same kind of swag in this industry. His swag stands out from each and every other stars present in the B town which is why he cannot get compared with anyone. But when it comes to stardom, the Khans of Bollywood, has reached the extent when they can easily get compared with veteran actors. When Salman Khan was giving auditions for Sooraj Barjatiya’s Maine Pyaar Kiya, he did a small role in Biwi Ho Toh Aisi. When the first cut of the movie got ready, a member from the crew of Biwi Ho Toh Aisi told Salman Khan that he looked like Big B. Yes, Salman Khan received such a huge compliment during his initial days in the industry. Any other actor would have been overwhelmed with joy after that compliment, but not Salman Khan. Salman Khan was very much angry when he received such a compliment. The actor folded his hands and requested the crew member not to compare him with Mr, Amitabh Bachchan. But why did Salman Khan give such a reaction? Does he hate the veteran actor?Well, before any speculations, let us explain the real reason behind such a reaction of Salman Khan. At that time a compliment like getting compared with Amitabh Bachchan meant a lot but it was a huge responsibility too. People applauded many actors for their style like Amitabh Bachchan but when the same actor failed to act like Big B, their career got ruined. And Salman Khan did not want his career to get ruined at the very initial stage, which is why he hated to get compared with Big B. Salman Khan is ready to get called the competitor of any other star but he hates being compared with Salman Khan.

TPESHXe8B0I,FAKE,Amitabh Bachchan Really Making Fun of Anushka Sharma's Baby ?,"Big B is Getting Trolled for Virat & Anushka’s Baby. Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma has become parents, of their little daughter, on 11th of January. This news has sent waves of happiness across the country and fans of the couple congratulated them. Many celebs have even come forward to wish the couple on their new phase of life. Just like the other celebs, Amitabh Bachchan also wished the couple through his social media account. Big B made a tweet hearing this good news, but because of this tweet, he is facing huge trolls on the internet. Netizens are leaving no stones unturned to bash this veteran actor of Bollywood. What has the veteran actor tweeted, that people are so angry upon him? Let us find out in this video. Amitabh Bachchan made a tweet, where he wrote that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a daughter, Ziva. And in his next tweet he went on to mention other cricketers’ names who has daughter. The actor mentioned that these daughters will be the future of Indian Women’s Cricket team. And he also mentioned that as Dhoni has a daughter, she will be the captain. These remarks of the veteran actor did not go down well with people and they started to troll Big B on Twitter. People started blaming him for nepotism in a sport like cricket also. Users wrote that Dhoni was a captain, but that does not mean Ziva needs to be captain or needs to be a cricketer at all. One user wrote that the biggest example of Children cannot always follow the footsteps of their parents is inside Bachchan family. Well, along with Big B, Abhishek Bachchan got trolled too by this remark. Not only this, even before, Big B was trolled on Twitter, for making spelling mistakes.

Bharti revealed that his mother wanted to abort her third baby who was Bharti. Bharti Singh’s mother, Kamla Singh tried various means to abort Bharti, but she failed. When Bharti appeared on the Rajeev Khandelwal’s chat show, Juzz Baat, she revealed some gruesome details about her childhood. Bharti said that Her family was very poor back then, and it was hard for them to raise three kids. Which is why, her parents do not want a third kid and when her mother got pregnant with her, she wanted to abort. She tried many ways to abort Bharti but failed to succeed and later she changed her mind, and decided to keep her. Bharti also revealed that, after Bharti was born, her mother never let her feel that she was unwanted. Kamla Singh loved her third child, Bharti, just like she loved her other two kids. Bharti also added that, now her mother is very proud of Bharti. It is her mother who motivates Bharti to work more harder in her life.

LoZXboySl2I,REAL,Shikara | Official Trailer | Dir: Vidhu Vinod Chopra | 7th February 2020,"What is it to know the agony of being a refugee in your own country? The year 1990 saw the biggest forced migration in independent India whereby more than 4,00,000 Kashmiri Pandits had to flee from the Kashmir Valley. Almost 3 decades later, most have been unable to return. 

Shikara is the story of resilience in the face of insurmountable odds. It’s also the story of a love that remains unextinguished through 30 years of exile.

A timeless love story in the worst of times.

Directed, Edited & Produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra in association with Fox Star Studios, Shikara is set to hit the theatres on 7th February, 2020.

rEnnQWWVRxc,REAL,Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s Filmfare Award Winning Speeches | Filmfare Awards | Birthday Special,"Aishwarya Rai, as goes her maiden name, paved her path to success the day she won the 1994 Miss World pageant. From that moment onwards, there was no turning back for this beauty. Regarded as the “most beautiful woman in the world”, Aishwarya became the queen of hearts within just a few years. 

She started her career as an actor in 1997 with Mani Ratnam’s Iruvar and did her first Hindi film, Aur Pyar Ho Gaya the same year. She went on to do several films in the next couple of years but her stroke to stardom came in 1999 with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Paired opposite superstars Salman Khan and Ajay Devgn, Aishwarya’s character Nandini struck several chords with the women of the time. She was naive yet fierce, strong but bound by the constitution of marriage, Aishwarya won her first Filmfare Award for her accurate portrayal of a woman in love. 

Her femininity and grace is known all over the globe. She’s an epitome of beauty and transcends her elegance even on screen. Taking the screen once again in a big way as Paro from Devdas in 2002, Aishwarya proved that her beauty maybe be paramount but her talent is exponentially bigger. She was awarded the Black Lady for her act in Bhansali’s drama yet again for her iconic role Paro. 

Aishwarya went on to do some brilliant roles thereafter. Films like Raincoat, Jodha Akbar and Raavan were some class acts by the superstar. But ruling over just Bollywood wasn’t enough for her. Aishwarya aced her act in several Hollywood films like Pink Panther 2, The Last Legion, and Mistress of Spices. 

Married to the junior Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is now one of the biggest names in not just in the film industries but also the fashion world across the globe. A larger-than-life career, global domination and the most loved family woman, Aishwarya is an inspiration for all. 

As the actress turns 46 today, we take a look back at two of her most cherished Filmfare moments... her winning speeches for both her Best Actress Awards.

Directors : Akshay Roy
Starring: Ayushmann Khurrana, Parineeti Chopra, Malvika Sitlani

A successful writer, Abhimanyu Roy (Ayushmann Khurrana) returns to his roots to write an old-fashioned love story, 3 years in the making. This writer's block is called Bindu (Parineeti Chopra). How do you contain this live wire in the pages of a book? When Abhi stumbles across an old audio cassette of their favourite playlist, it sends him down memory lane and his novel starts writing itself.

►Badrinath Ki Dulhania
Directors: Shashank Khaitan
Starring: Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Sahil Vaid

Badrinath Ki Dulhania is a story of Badrinath Bansal from Jhansi and Vaidehi Trivedi from Kota and what happens when the two of them meet. Even though they both belong to small towns, their mindset about gender roles in society and about life in general are diametrically opposite. This leads to a clash of ideologies, despite both of them recognizing the goodness in each other.

Dhakka Laga Bukka Lyrics :

Aankhon mein angaar hai, angaar hai.
Aur saanson mein toofan hai, toofan hai.
Mitti ki hum moorat hai par, hausle aasmaan hai.

There’s fire in our eyes
And a storm in our breaths
Men of this soil, we’ll fight to our deaths

Kalyug mein chaadar safed oadhe, jab jab Raavan aayega.
Jab jab jab Raavan aayega.
Har Yuva mein Ram samayega.

Hidden in plain sight, when the devil takes the crown
When the devil takes the crown
The Yuva (Youth) will strike it down

O Yuva Yuva... (x2)

O Yuva Yuva... (x2)

Dhakka Laga Bukka, khayega re mukka. (x2)
Hath ja, hath ja re. (x3)
Hath hath hath hath hath hath hath.

Come at us clown, we’ll knock you down (x2)
Get out, get out of our way (x3)
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Dhakka Laga Bukka, khayega re mukka. (x2)
Ban ja re ban ja, mashal-e-raah. O Yuva Yuva, O Yuva. (x2)

Come at us clown, we’ll knock you down (x2)
Please be our guiding light, O Yuva Yuva, O Yuva (x2)

Dhakka Laga Bukka, khayega re mukka. (x2)
Hath ja, hath ja, hath ja re. (x3)
Hath hath hath hath hath hath hath.

Come at us clown, we’ll knock you down (x2)
Get out, get out, get out of our way (x3)
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

O Yuva Yuva...

O Yuva Yuva...

Lehrein uthi hai, shor macha hai.
Josh sa koi, hum mein utha hai.
Hum hain sailaabi.

There’s a wave, there’s uproar
There’s fire in our belly and rage in our soul
We’re a Tsunami

Doobi doobi si tumhe jaise hoti chamakti moti hai, moti jyoti hai.
Kirdaar aise hi dil mein saje hain humare.

Like shining pearls seeded deep at the ocean’s heart
These characters shine brightly in our hearts

Apne usool hai, apni samajh.
Duniya ko apni nigahon se parakh.
Sach aur jhooth ka farak samajh.
Zulm ko de de zameen pe patak.

Have your principles, have your own mind
Perceive the world through your eye
Accept the truth, recognize the lie
Protect the world from the devil’s evil eye

O Yuva. (x7)

O Yuva (x7)

Dhakka Laga Bukka, khayega re mukka. (x2)
Hath ja, hath ja re. (x3)
Hath hath hath hath hath hath hath.

Come at us clown, we’ll knock you down (x2)
Get out, get out of our way (x3)
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Dhakka Laga Bukka, khayega re mukka. (x2)
Ban ja re ban ja, mashal-e-raah. O Yuva Yuva, O Yuva. (x2)

Come at us clown, we’ll knock you down (x2)
Please be our guiding light, O Yuva Yuva, O Yuva (x2)

Ban ja re ban ja, mashal-e-raah. O Yuva Yuva, O Yuva. (x2)
O Yuva Yuva...

Please be our guiding light, O Yuva Yuva, O Yuva (x2)
O Yuva Yuva...

About Gulabo Sitabo

Welcome to the World of Gulabo Sitabo where two slimy scheming foxes in a game of one upmanship, each one attracting other members to their clan and each one with an agenda of his own.

Meet ‘Mirza’(Amitabh Bachchan) – a 78yrs old landlord, who would move heaven and earth for his most priced possession – an old Dilapidated Mansion in the heart of Lucknow

But this garden of roses comes with its own cluster of ‘pricky thorns’ – tenants. Amongst them most prominently, ‘Baankey’ (Ayushmann Khuranna)’ a shrewd, sly and squatted tenant, who matches Mirza bit for bit in their ceaseless bantering. 

Gulabo Sitabo is a quirky slice of life where Mirza and Baankey are like Tom and Jerry - unique and unmatched, friend and foe, naughty and smart, little and large, all combine to produce chaos

Gulabo Sitabo, the dramedy, premieres on June 12, exclusively on Amazon Prime Video.

rH-dbIHR_lw,REAL,"Chhalaang | Making of Care Ni Karda | Rajkummar R, Nushrratt B | YoYo Honey Singh, Alfaaz, Hommie D","Bringing you all the fun, laughter and care that went behind the making of Chhalaang’s Care Ni Karda.

Chhalaang stars Rajkummar Rao & Nushrratt Bharuccha. The film is written by Luv Ranjan, Aseem Arrora & Zeishan Quadri, it is directed by Hansal Mehta, produced by Ajay Devgn, Luv Ranjan & Ankur Garg, and presented by Bhushan Kumar. 
Chhalaang is slated to release on Amazon Prime Video, this Diwali, Nov 13. 
Chhalaang is a hilarious, yet inspirational journey of a PT Master from a semi government funded school in Northern India. Montu (Rajkummar Rao) is a typical PT Master for whom it’s just a job. When circumstances put everything that Montu cares for at stake, including Neelu (Nushrratt Bharuccha) who he loves, Montu is forced to do what he has never done - Teach. Through Montu’s journey, Chhalaang humorously addresses the value of Sports Education in the school curriculum.

Synopsis:
The film follows the escape of two people belonging to two different worlds within our society and the circumstances that brings them together.

Sandy Walia short for Sandeep Kaur Walia (Parineeti Chopra) is a 30 year old single, pregnant, senior banker working in a growing private sector bank now wanting to resign. Post her resignation, Sandeep and her boss decide to meet for a final 'goodbye' dinner at a high class lounge in Delhi. After waiting for a significant time, Sandy decides to leave with an old acquaintance for another party when she is secretly hauled by Pinky (Arjun Kapoor), short for Satinder Dahiya a 35 year old, divorced, suspended police officer who works with the Special Unit cell of the Delhi Police, into a car and driven off into the deserted roads of Gurgaon.

While the two drive away from the main city of Delhi, Pinky seems tense and is continuously talking to his boss over the phone who gives him directions to a barricade point. Amidst all the confusion, Pinky's intuition kicks in and he decides to give wrong information as a result of which both Sandy and Pinky watch a false car being attacked in front of their eyes, killing everyone inside.

From this moment onwards, Sandy and Pinky realise that they are marked for a kill and have to run to be alive. A deal is cracked between the two where they plan to cross the Indian border and escape to Nepal post which the two would go their own way.

Throughout their journey together, while they are continuously being chased by the 'big people' who want them dead, Sandy and Pinky reveal themselves in ways that affect each other and make them reflect on their lives in the past. The people they meet on this journey, both influence and are influenced by them. They bring them to a final internal realisation on what 'escaping' or 'freedom' actually means to them.

Synopsis:
India’s top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the crème de la crème of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra’s key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country.

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir’s team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid’s intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir’s greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country’s enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid.

But Khalid’s greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero’s head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists - he is the best protégé and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question - why did he turn rogue?

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as protégé goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

Synopsis:
A 21-year old boy named Sunny (Vishal Jethwa), comes to the city on a murder contract given to him by the city’s strongest political player. Sunny looks like any other innocent 21-year old, but there’s more to him. He has a penchant for sexually assaulting and eventually murdering young girls. While at it, he locks horns with Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukerji), the newly appointed chief of the city police. Sunny’s fascinated by her persona. That’s when we come to know that he has a thing for strong, independent women. Shivani persists and manages to get a witness who can identify Sunny. But he manages to eliminate the witness, that too from right under Shivani's nose. This creates unrest in the city and leads to the transfer of Shivani from her position. But before her transfer could come into force, with her small team, she decides to take on Sunny and nab him within 48 hours. 

Bit by bit, Shivani tracks Sunny’s hideout. In one particularly nerve-wracking pursuit, Shivani chases him down but he jumps into the Chambal river. An injured Shivani tries to catch him, but he escapes. From here begins a thrilling cat and mouse hunt between them. Sunny is all set with an escape plan out of the city as well. His plan includes abducting a female social worker who’s about to stand for the next election and using her to negotiate his way out. Meanwhile, Shivani is hounded by the media, led by the well-known reporter Amit Sharma about her role in instigating the serial killer to go a killing spree in city. On one hand the partial media and on the other hand... only a few hours left to hunt a serial killer who’s out to target more women. Will Shivani manage to nab Sunny, or does she too turn into one of his victims?

That’s when we come to know that he has a thing for strong, independent women. Shivani persists and manages to get a witness who can identify Sunny. But he manages to eliminate the witness, that too from right under Shivani's nose. This creates unrest in the city and leads to the transfer of Shivani from her position. But before her transfer could come into force, with her small team, she decides to take on Sunny and nab him within 48 hours. 

Bit by bit, Shivani tracks Sunny’s hideout. In one particularly nerve-wracking pursuit, Shivani chases him down but he jumps into the Chambal river. An injured Shivani tries to catch him, but he escapes. From here begins a thrilling cat and mouse hunt between them. Sunny is all set with an escape plan out of the city as well. His plan includes abducting a female social worker who’s about to stand for the next election and using her to negotiate his way out. Meanwhile, Shivani is hounded by the media, led by the well-known reporter Amit Sharma about her role in instigating the serial killer to go a killing spree in city. On one hand the partial media and on the other hand... only a few hours left to hunt a serial killer who’s out to target more women. Will Shivani manage to nab Sunny, or does she too turn into one of his victims?

Synopsis:
India’s top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the crème de la crème of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra’s key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country.

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir’s team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid’s intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir’s greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country’s enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid.

But Khalid’s greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero’s head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists – he is the best protégé and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question – why did he turn rogue?

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as protégé goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

A 21-year old boy named Sunny (Vishal Jethwa), comes to the city on a murder contract given to him by the city’s strongest political player.

That’s when we come to know that he has a thing for strong, independent women. Shivani persists and manages to get a witness who can identify Sunny.

Synopsis:
When they ran to save their lives for the first time, they were mere 12-year-old boys, and the world called them 'refugees'.

The war of 1971 gave birth to a new country - Bangladesh. It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram and Bala. They witnessed the war and its aftermath, where the world tried to trample over them. Fighting for survival, they clung to each other and escaped to Calcutta.

Before they knew the world, they knew each other. Such was their bond, such was their friendship.

Each time they sought new beginnings, each time they would rise, the world would crush them down. So, they fought again... and again. Together they were unbeatable. They were unstoppable. They were inseparable.

In the years that passed, Bikram and Bala, became Calcutta's most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless and most powerful GUNDAY!

They had everything... then, one fine day, bells rang...

Nandita, the most beautiful cabaret dancer, walked into their lives, and they lost everything to her. Their murky world turned magical and colourful. They fell head over heels in love with her.

But that was only a blissful lull before an impending storm...

And then entered ACP Satyajeet Sarkar, the right for every wrong, a law for every outlaw and a counter force for Bikram and Bala.

What follows from here is the most sensational-most thrilling-most dramatic story ever told!

Synopsis:
Sultan is a story of Sultan Ali Khan - a local wrestling champion with the world at his feet as he dreams of representing India at the Olympics.

It’s a story of Aarfa - a feisty young girl from the same small town as Sultan with her own set of dreams.

When the 2 local wrestling legends lock horns, romance blossoms and their dreams and aspirations become intertwined and aligned.

However, the path to glory is a rocky one and one must fall several times before one stands victorious - More often than not, this journey can take a lifetime. Sultan is a classic underdog tale about a wrestler's journey, looking for a comeback by defeating all odds staked up against him. But when he has nothing to lose and everything to gain in this fight for his life match… Sultan must literally fight for his life.

Sultan believes he’s got what it takes… but this time, it’s going to take everything he’s got.

""Wrestling is not a sport it's about fighting what lies within""….. SULTAN

BHWrsTWR0xA,REAL,Deepika Padukone Interview With Anupama Chopra | Padmaavat | Film Companion,"The success of Padmaavat makes Deepika Padukone one of the most powerful women in Bollywood. Rarely has a film of this scale been centred on a female protagonist. In this interview, Deepika talks about how she can use her success positively and why she's looking to do something fun and light now. While she's searches for a script that interests her, she tells us about how she's spending her free time at home. She also talks about speculations on her marriage and why she can now imagine herself being a working wife or mother.

Shah Rukh Khan | Anupama Chopra | Film Companion,"In our third conversation in just as many months, Shah Rukh Khan talks to Anupama Chopra about Raees, the ambiguous morality of portraying a negative character on screen and the pressures of expectation that being a star entails. As always, he speaks candidly- about feeling that he let Fan director Maneesh Sharma down, about missing the rawness that is afforded when an actor is just starting out and his reluctant acceptance that no matter his actual involvement in a film, he becomes the assumed leader of the pack.

Synopsis:
Have you ever stopped to think if the most ordinary, uninteresting, unobtrusive man you might see on the road or around you might have a love story to tell? Maybe not! How can an ordinary man have a breathtaking, goose flesh igniting, awe inspiring love story of all things to tell?

This is what happened to Surinder Sahni (Shah Rukh Khan) - a simple, clean hearted, honest man, leading a humdrum life, when he meets his total opposite and finds love in the flamboyant, fun-loving, vivacious - Taani (Anushka Sharma) for whom the whole world is her canvas and she paints her own life with the colours of rainbow all until unforeseen circumstances changes it all and brings them together.

What follows is a journey filled with laughter, tears, joy, pain, music, dance and a lot of love. A journey that makes us believe that there is an extraordinary love story in every ordinary jodi (couple).

Tere rang aisa chadh gaya
Koi aur rang na chadh sake
Tera naam seeney pe likha
Har koi aake padh sakey

Hai junoon hai junoon hai
Tere ishq ka ye junoon hai
Rag rag mein ishq tera daudta
Yeh bawra sa khoon hai
Tune hi sikhaya sachai oo ka matlab
Tere paas aake jaana maine zindagi ka maksad
Satyamev, satyamev, satyamev jayate
Sacha hai pyaar tera, satyamev jayate

Tere noor ke dastoor mein
Na ho salwatein na shikan rahe
Meri koshishein toh hai bas yaheen
Rahein khushbooein gulshan rahe
Teri zulf suljhaney chala
Terey aur paas aaney chala
Jahan koi sur na ho besura
Woh geet main ganey chala

Tere rang aisa chadh gaya
Tha nasha jo aur bhi badh gaya
Teri barishon ka karam hai ye
Main nikhar Gaya main sanwar gaya
Jaisa bhi hoon apna mujhey
Mujhey ye nahin hain bolna
Kabil tere main ban sakoo
Mujhey dwaar aisa kholna
Sanson ki iss raftaar ko
Dhadkan ke iss tyohaar ko
Har jeet ko har haar ko
Khud apney iss sansaar ko
Badloonga main tere liye

Mujhey khud ko bhi hai tatolna
Kahin hai kami to hai bolna
Khahin dag hain toh chupayein kyon
Hum sach se nazrein hatayein kyon
khud ko badalna hai agar
Badloonga main tere liye
Sholon pe chalna hai agar
Chal doonga main tere liye
Mere khoon kee har boond main
Sankalp ho tere pyaar ka

PfmXm6ucyOM,REAL,Rendezvous with Simi Garewal Rekha Part 1,"REKHA
  Rekha is a friend. She had watched each and every Rendezvous and told me how much she loved them. For several years I invited her to have a rendezvous with me, she would always reply, ""I don't have the self-confidence.""  
  The time came for my 100th Rendezvous episode. I wanted a' special guest' for this landmark show, so I asked her once again. This time she agreed - and it really was 'special'...
  I've known Rekha for a long time. I find her absorbing - and very entertaining too. She is a great mimic! 
  We have endless phone talks - always about four hours! And each time she surprises me with new facets in her to love. Rekha is 
immensely wise and astute. Acutely observant. Has an elephantine memory. She is also the least self-obsessed star I know; some one who never harbours a mean thought or word. Rekha loves generously. 
  In my rendezvous -- I took her back in her journey from Bhanurekha, the child; through her stormy adolescence.. her stardom.. her loves...marriages.. covering, in fact, Rekha's entire evolution.
  It's a panoramic canvas of one of the most legendary stars of our time -- and also  - an intimate portrait of a woman.
  Don't miss it....Watch the other two parts as well!

I found Sush fascinating! Here is a woman who lives completely on her terms. We are all victims of our gender, of society, of people’s opinions. They tie us down, they suppress us, but they don't suppress Sush. She is without hypocrisy. She is unafraid.  
How many single women would adopt a child at 24 - knowing it could complicate your life and relationships enormously? And now she’s adopted another girl! The moments between her and her Renée were pure magic. One of my favourite shows...

KTjrTSd2TkI,REAL,Rendezvous with Simi Garewal Amitabh Bachchan & Family Part 1,"THE BACHCHANS  2004
  Five years had passed since my first rendezvous with Amit-ji. He had come through a lot, health, finance and career problems. But now he was back, bigger than ever before...a legend.
  No one can claim to 'know' Amitabh. So I had to meet him with the persons he is closest to in the world -- his family.
 They arrived through the studio gates in a stately convoy of luxury make-up vans and Mercedes SL 500s. The women dressed in brocades and rubies; the men in their classic 
designer suits and ties. It was the Bachchans, Amitabh, Jaya, Shweta and Abhishek, keeping their 'Rendezvous with Simi Garewal'. 
  I loved the camaraderie, the in-house jokes, the teasing, which only a family can get away with! I also sensed the unstated alliances. Amit-ji and Shweta were a team! Jaya-ji and Abhishek. And yet, they were a unit of one.    
 Without doubt, India has a continuing love-affair with Amitabh Bachchan. They've seen him in hundreds of films in hundreds of roles..but here they'll see him in his essence -- as the family man.

Saif Ali Khan the  young struggling newcomer. 
They were husband and wife. 
This rendezvous captures the story of their budding romance and marriage.
It captures the young Saif, witty, carefree and fun...
It captures the feisty, strong-willed Amrita who took a back-seat as she nurtured her young husband on the way to success.. 
Two children later Amrita and Saif divorced.          
Today Saif is a big star in his own right, married to Kareena.  
But in 1999 this is the way Amrita and Saif were...

She had recently started her journey in Bollywood.There is a freshness and charm that surprisingly remains, even today. Through the years we have become friends. She is natural and unpretentious and sensitive. I have seen so much warmth and affection from her.  It is always sheer delight to sit opposite the exquisite and ethereal Aishwarya Rai.

I asked Karan to bring his 'best friend' for our Rendezvous. He brought Kajol.

In the 60th edition of the Filmfare Awards, we saw a stunning performance by Varun Dhawan and caught Alia Bhatt match tunes with host Kapil Sharma in a hilarious segment with our host, Karan Johar. Joining Karan on stage for the first time was Arjun Kapoor who entertained the audience with his impeccable comic timing on stage. It was also the year we saw Salman Khan and Deepika Padukone share the stage and shake a leg to a chartbuster and spread a laughter riot across the venue. 

Mixing it up with the entertainment quotient, Shahid Kapoor for Haider and Kangana Ranaut for Queen were the big winners of the night as they swept the popular choice awards for their performances that year. Queen also took the trophy for the Best Film that year.

Hoga woh lakhon dil ka chor
Humka toh laage bore

Synopsis:
Choices... to choose between right or wrong is simple, but what defines one's life is the decision between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils. This is the advice that Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol) receives from her father just as she is about to venture out into the world of her own for the very first time. Little does she know that these very words will shape her life.

Zooni, a blind Kashmiri girl, meets Rehan Qadri (Aamir Khan), a local Delhi tour guide and an incorrigible flirt. Her friends warn her against this good-for-nothing roadside Romeo, but she chooses to ignore them. It is now her time to discover life and love. Is this really the right choice?

Rehan is fascinated by Zooni and wants her to see life as it should be seen, in its many colours. He promises her that the time spent with him will be the most precious in all her life. Zooni sees Delhi, life and love like she never has before, because of Rehan.

What Zooni doesn't know is that Rehan has another side of his life that he has kept from her - something that can not only change her life, but can also destroy it.

Synopsis:
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) is a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force. In the line of duty he comes across a stranded Zaara (Preity Zinta)... a girl from Pakistan who has come to India to fulfill her surrogate mothers dying wish. Veer saves her life and his life is never the same again.

Twenty two years later Saamia Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), a Pakistani human rights lawyer on her first case, finds herself face to face with an aging Veer Pratap Singh. He has languished in a Pakistan jail cell for 22 years and has not spoken to anyone all these years. And no one knows why. Her mission is to discover the truth about Veer and see to it that justice is served.

VEER-ZAARA is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation & deepens with sacrifice. A love that is an inspiration... and will remain a legend forever.

Synopsis:
India’s top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the crème de la crème of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra’s key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country. 

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir’s team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid’s intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir’s greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country’s enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid. 

But Khalid’s greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.  

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero’s head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists – he is the best protégé and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question – why did he turn rogue? 

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as protégé goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

Synopsis:
Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) knows what it's like to come back from the dead. The ex Indian Captain has now come back in the avatar of the Coach of the Indian Women's National Hockey team. A team that exists more on paper and less in reality.

The team is a rag-tag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick, keeping their eyes on the ball and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team? To play for India?

The girls have never known the thrilling energy of being Team India. Of giving their all to see their country's name on a trophy. But Kabir Khan, once a captain, now forgotten, does. He knows what it takes to get there. And what it means to return empty handed. This time, he wants to make sure that it's different. He knows there are no second chances. Despite his past, he believes that if only the girls played as one, anything would be possible.

Because Kabir Khan believes that it is not that we can't win. It's just that we have never believed we can.

CHAK DE INDIA is the story of a coach's fight of making his team, Team India by overcoming their diverse backgrounds, by learning to use everything that life hurls on them as a secret weapon. It's a story about honesty, sincerity and integrity. The Film became a cult classic and won its leading man the National Award and put the Indian National Sport ""Hockey"", back on the map.

Synopsis:
Fed up with the lack of critical appreciation despite being a successful writer, Abhimanyu Roy (Ayushmann Khurrana) returns to his roots in Kolkata to write more meaningful literature and decides on an old-fashioned love story - which was now, 3 years in the making.

This writers block is called Bindu (Parineeti Chopra). How do you contain this unpredictable, crazy, restless, larger than life, live wire in the pages of a book?

As Abhi says ‘‘You know when a song comes on and you just have to dance? Bindu was that song. That silly infectious joyful tune you couldn’t get out of your head… even if you wanted to.”

So where should he begin? Where should he end?

But when Abhi stumbles across an old audio cassette of their favourite playlist, it sends Abhi down memory lane… and as he waltzes in and out of his past and present through the songs in the mixed tape, he finally faces reality and reconnects with his roots, with his family and his novel starts writing itself.

Of course, life in its usual scheming manner surprises him yet again and changes the ending of his book and his life, as he once again finds himself being pulled back into the center of that crazy little thing called love.

He realizes, that love, is neither time- nor place-dependent….
All we need is the right person next to us and of course the right soundtrack.

Synopsis:
It is the 1990s, the tape-cassette is dying, CDs will soon be the rage and a regular arranged marriage will turn out to be a perfect mismatch. Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a shy music buff who runs a tape recording shop in Haridwar. Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) likes to dance to the band tunes at her own wedding. He has nightmares about drawing a blank at his English exam. She is about to carve a niche for herself as a teacher.

But now, they are married and they are supposed to spend a lifetime together - and he is still trying to find balance on their scooter ride together. From overcoming his fear of the English language to dealing with an overbearing father, he discovers that his oversized wife, who he thought was a spanner in his spool, will actually lead him to something quite cool.

Synopsis:
""Sui Dhaaga - Made in India"" is a heartwarming story of pride and self reliance, which finds its roots in the heart of India and reflects the passion that runs through the veins of every single Indian. Taking the message of ""Made in India"" forward, the film modestly tries to bring back our traditional art forms and handicrafts in focus. The film is helmed by National award winning Producer - Director Duo of Maneesh Sharma and Sharat Katariya (Dum Laga ke Haisha) and features Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma in the lead roles.

Through the hero & his wife, film talks about the need of social entrepreneurship as a tool for social and economic development of our artisans, living their life in the margins due to the changing times. Set in a small town in India, the film encapsulates the journey of an honest man from a humble background, who pursues his passion, overcoming all odds and soon finds himself on the cover of an international magazine with the world taking note and appreciating his talent.

A clean family entertainer, the film emphasizes virtues like honesty, self respect and community living.

R4LA6v2u47Q,REAL,Manto - Official Teaser | Nawazuddin Siddiqui | Nandita Das | Viacom18 Motion Pictures,"Presenting the official teaser of Manto starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui, directed by Nandita Das. 

Manto the film follows the most tumultuous four years in the life of Manto and that of the two countries he inhabits – India and Pakistan. In Bombay’s seedy-shiny film world, Manto and his stories are widely read and accepted. But as sectarian violence engulfs the nation, Manto makes the difficult choice of leaving his beloved Bombay. In Lahore, he finds himself bereft of friends and unable to find takers for his writings. His increasing alcoholism leads him into a downward spiral. Through all of this, he continues to write prolifically, without dilution. This is the tale of two emerging nations, two faltering cities, and one man who tries to make sense of it all.

Official Trailer coming soon!

1J76wN0TPI4,REAL,Sanju | Official Trailer | Ranbir Kapoor | Rajkumar Hirani | Releasing on 29th June,"Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt.

Sanju is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “did this really happen?” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.

Synopsis:
Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) knows what it's like to come back from the dead. The ex Indian Captain has now come back in the avatar of the Coach of the Indian Women's National Hockey team. A team that exists more on paper and less in reality.

The team is a rag-tag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick, keeping their eyes on the ball and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team? To play for India?

The girls have never known the thrilling energy of being Team India. Of giving their all to see their country's name on a trophy. But Kabir Khan, once a captain, now forgotten, does. He knows what it takes to get there. And what it means to return empty handed. This time, he wants to make sure that it's different. He knows there are no second chances. Despite his past, he believes that if only the girls played as one, anything would be possible.

Because Kabir Khan believes that it is not that we can't win. It's just that we have never believed we can.

CHAK DE INDIA is the story of a coach's fight of making his team, Team India by overcoming their diverse backgrounds, by learning to use everything that life hurls on them as a secret weapon. It's a story about honesty, sincerity and integrity. The Film became a cult classic and won its leading man the National Award and put the Indian National Sport ""Hockey"", back on the map.

Actor Rajkummar Rao, who is known for his phenomenal performances, said he doesn't feel any external pressure due to the expectations people have from him as he ""loves to explore"" his characters.

Asked how is his approach towards characters in these films, he said: ""It depends on the script, the character and how much it demands from me. Like 'Trapped' is a serious film with a demanding script whereas 'Behen Hogi Teri' is a fun film. Once you are done, it is easy to come out from the character of a fun film.""

About his favourite genre of the two, the 32-year-old said: ""I really can't say. Both are equally exciting. As an actor, I love pushing myself.""

Asked how he feels when people await for a good film from him, he said: ""I think this is a big compliment for me that people can vouch for a good film from me. It's a great position to be in.""

About mainstream cinema, the 'Shahid' actor said that commercial cinema is going through a changing phase. ""All superstars are doing films like 'Dangal', 'Raees', 'Sultan'. It is a wonderful change and the whole definition of commercial cinema has transformed.""

In his forthcoming film 'Trapped', Rajkummar plays a man who is trapped in his own house at a high-rise building with no escape. Produced by Phantom Films and directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, it is set to release on March 17.

Touted as one of the bravest battle ever fought, 21 courageous Sikhs countered 10,000 invaders. These saffron clad warriors fought valiantly against all odds and changed the meaning of bravery. This Holi, celebrate the spirit of bravery & sacrifice with Kesari. 

केसरी सारागारी की लड़ाई पर आधारित एक अविश्वसनीय लेकिन सच्ची कहानी है। अब तक की सबसे बहादुर लड़ाई में से एक के रूप में, 21 साहसी सिखों ने अपने क्षेत्र की रक्षा के लिए 10,000 आक्रमणकारियों के खिलाफ लड़ाई लड़ी। इन भगवा पहने योद्धाओं ने सभी बाधाओं के खिलाफ साहस से लड़ाई लड़ी और इतिहास के पाठ्यक्रम को बदल दिया। यह होली, केसरी के साथ बलिदान की भावना का जश्न मनाती है।
