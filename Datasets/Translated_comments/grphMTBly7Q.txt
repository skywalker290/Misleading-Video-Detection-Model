your opinion SUPER SUCKS

Brainy is a cringy simp by season 5 

melissa&#39;s carrying the whole thing

Women really need to stop viewing men as evil human beings

Am I crazy that I think Arrow S2 is actually good? (even compared to other shows we have today)

Blame writers not actors

I thought seasons 1 - 3 were decent

Last season was mid

Supergirl may be bad but at least she’s not racist and anti semantic , right Felix?

That first bit looked like something out of nollywood

I loved how the CW shows started off. The Arrow was almost entirely reconstructed, but it was still amazing. The Flash was also really really good too, perfect even. But like after the first season of the Arrow, it just kinda fell off. The Flash had a longer good run, but like after the first half of season 6, it just became unbearable to watch. Still, the Flash ended well though. With the last couple episodes of season 9 like episode 9 and episode 10, they were able to fulfill our expectations. But the OTHER shows were way worse though.

that bullet was WAYYY to big for that gun too.... jesus CW, so political in their shows too! makes me want to puke lol

This is how every superhero movie looks to me

I watched this and I don’t remember it being this bad 

Kamen Rider and Ultraman are better than the retarded cw DC shows

<a href="">2:49</a> GEORGE SOROS

Supergirl  sucks! 
At least she makes a better looking Super Girl than the unattractive masculine-looking b*<b>*</b> in the new Flash movie.

Your fake laugh is pathetic

Power Rangers level action!!... but without any fun

All in all &#39;Men bad women good&#39;‍
Tf dude
&quot;You can be doing anything else&quot; Pewdiepie

LMFAO all the Wokes mad in this comment section 

I just wish Cat Grant had been hit by some random bus in the series finale.  Let&#39;s face it - CW has been 80% SJW for years.  I watched Supergirl to the bitter end, and will tolerate a lot of bad TV to finish a storyline, but I couldn&#39;t go more than about 5 minutes without rolling my eyes HARD while viewing it.

were  not gona win well dyg allyou so is spin your arms

<a href="">2:32</a> they don’t.

this video has more veiws then supergirl currently has

<a href="">0:02</a> this applies to the halo tv series as well

Supergirl become way to political after season 2!

ah, shit. the CW&#39;s done it again.

<b>Good work, people. This garbage had been cancelled. I thank PewDiePie for his contributions in removing this disgrace to entertainment from our lives.</b>

Even power rangers has better cgi than this

Cgi must have been done by a woman 

<a href="">3:49</a>

This has more viewers than their season. Kinda sad

came back for a clip but damn that Leeroy Jenkins made me cringe so hard I got a leg cramp

<a href="">8:30</a>

Why didn&#39;t Pewds review Batgirl?

Supergirl&#39;s first 2-3 seasons were actually good. Before all the wokeness being pushed

I thought it was alright for tv

Discount Adam Driver yelling &quot;Leroy Jenkins&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was considered the best scene in the series by far.

Supergirl? More like <b>Super Woke.</b> Lol
Why are u saying ao bad things? Why are u mean..

I finished it, but I didn&#39;t enjoy it. I will never watch series again...

Dis some below spy kids sfx

The writers are to blame because the actors are great at their job.

i love the main actress because she&#39;s just like me unironically

1st 3 seasons were good

U gotta see cw the flash season 7 cgi that’s just sad

Strongly agree 

The funniest part is that Supergirl still has almost twice as many viewers as cnn

evil space alien XDDDDDD perfect description
Maybe it’s just cause I was raised on cw shows to begin with not to mention the dc universe, but flash arrow and supergirl are my comfort shows. I rewatch these shows over and over. I actually watch nothing else. The writing is cringe and the cgi isn’t the best but to be fair early on cw they couldn’t even make an explosion not look like a green screen. But I still loved their shows. I just wasn’t picky on how they looked lol. Charmed looked absolute ass but I still own all the seasons

Bro you should watch the other arrow verse shows they are absolutely hilarious to laugh at

Fever dream material
The flash and the arrow, were good in the first two seasons but just went downhill to the level of this shit.

What YOU are cringe

poo pi pie

Bull sheet why you are hating this video

I love superhero shows &amp; I’ve tried to watch Supergirl but it’s terrible, woke 

<a href="">0:01</a> &quot;Who funds these shows? [...] I don&#39;t understand why would anyone watch.&quot;, <i>Felix Kjellberg</i>Here goes someone that loves these kind of shows:&quot;1986’s ‘Top Gun’ Drove A Military Recruiting Boom.&quot;, <i>CPR News</i>

You know, a one night stand involves both a man and a woman... So how exactly is it a guy thing to do:?

Still less cringe than that Endgame girl power scene

the first season is actually not bad and maybe season 2 but the rest is just awful

The fact how he said supergirl cringe when he was more cringe in this video wait to the end

&quot;On my planet, females bow before males&quot;&quot;This is not your planet&quot;&quot;No, that&#39;s why I made the reference to &#39;my&#39; planet...your retort, pointing that out though was pure gold...sheesh...I&#39;m gone already...do with me what you wish after that one&quot;

Season one was alright

pewds i love your videos but watching clips without prior context is very weird i think you should watch some seasons its not that cringe

I'm glad I don't watch that rubbish anymore
What do you create...anything?  Or do you just criticize?

The arrowverse makes me embarressed to be a dc fan

.

Man Supergirl didn&#39;t use to be bad, it just went so downhill after those first 2-ish seasons, and those crossover events

leroy jenkins into a power slide sooo awesome

dumpest shit i have ever seen! super girl just as bad as captain marvel

Really Supergirl web series have so worst chi and also the flash web series but the flash web series s 1 have good chi but now the flash web series have not good cgi

If I have nothing to watch, I watch thatI’m just focus on the story itself, don’t take it seriously or you have nothing to watch…

This might be one of the most cringiest Super hero tv shows out there lol

This doesn&#39;t even happen in the episode

The arrow verse is great alright pewdiepie

I watched the first season of super girl it&#39;s not even worth watching. Very cringe stuff ngl

Lmao the series finale had 490,000 viewers.   People that were even watching at the beginning of season 6 didn&#39;t watch the series finale.

Forget the cgi. This is mostly the director&#39;s fault. Every frame in this looks like it was recorded by some dude with an iPhone

“He’s black too”Little does Felix know he’s actually green

I&#39;m 6&#39;2 and I got offended when the lady made the remark about guys under 6 foot. So that just proves that its sexist

lol that construction worker guy now gets to say he played supergirl

New adventures of lois and clark &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

E

THE NE GUSTA TOOK ME BACK A GOOD TEN YEARS HOLY BALLS 
I honestly liked the first season, but after that it sucked

&quot;You know Amy, Anytime someone calls attention to the breaking of gender roles, it ultimately undermines the concept of gender equality by implying that this is an exception and not the status quo.&quot;-Knuckles, Sonic Boom (Season 2, Episode 38)

&quot;Hey can you pass me that cup of water? It&#39;s right beside you&quot;&quot;Why?? Cause I&#39;m a black woman????&quot;

Imagine fighting for body positivity and then insulting a guy for being under 6 ft 0.0

why does she wind up to jump lmao. i get why for film but why

Hi pewdiepie 
I love how Pewds doesnt directly insult SJW bullshit but still destroy them lmao

At least they&#39;ve tried to make films to entertain the people.

what happens when you don&#39;t give supergirl laser tits

one night stand is a guy? who was he doing it with ? a 2 night stand??

First clip looked straight outta a power rangers episode.

Yo i think he should watch the super girl is kinda shit compered to the other ones

Omg

S1&#39;s villain is Cara&#39;s real aunt, right?

<a href="">5:25</a>

Wow, this is my first time Hollywood with bad cgi. Can I be happy now? It&#39;s close to Philippine fantasy series in our television.

I really liked the first season of Supergirl and then it just went downhill.

Why do these feminist weirdos think it’s oke to rip on shorter men? Who is normalising verbal abuse against a huge chunk of people? So if one fails to meet your beauty standard then it’s oke to be a bully? No wonder their rating dropped, absolute garbage.

<a href="">10:10</a> that sent shivers down my spine. i dont even care how ironic that was

Supergirl should’ve been the one cancelled instead of The Swamp Thing.

Supergirl beating Superman, pfft . That&#39;s not happening that&#39;s so stupid, its a well known fact that men are physically stronger than women, this is basic biology.

I hate how they try to make super girl stronger than Superman when in reality she don’t even math his actual strength lmaooooo

I want everyone to see it (￣ ▽ ￣) May the ducks heal you (￣ ▽ ￣) Spread peace (￣ ▽ ￣)  
That viewer graph looks like my retention graph

Woman &quot;I have trouble engaging in conversation with men under 6 feet tall.&quot; Man &quot;I have trouble engaging with women over 140 pounds&quot; Outcry &quot;REEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot;What hypocrisy

Wow.... I loved Supergirl...

Dude I watched the video of this supergirl crazy fan reacting to this video dude was boiling inside and had the most dumbest responses had me laughing I swear to god

first go and watch the series and then give your opinion

FLASH IS GOOD, I JUST STARTED SUPER MAN AND LOIS AND IT IS ACTUALLY FIRE IVE GOT LIKE 6 GOATED SUPERHERO SHOWS FR FLASH IS LIKE 6 7, GOTHAM GOATED

Indian movies: We have worst action!Supergirl: Hold my dishes!

The &#39;me gusta&#39; reference forced my mouse to land on the like button.

Wait they have “the view” in supergirl universe  nuff said

Stay based my good sir felix

You probably didn&#39;t heard about &quot;Victor Magtanggol&quot; form Philippines

The reason why Supergirl went downhill was cause too much drama, they changed Kara’s personality, instead of adapting to her potential future as angry badass dark Kara, joining the Legion of Superheroes and have her life with Brainy in the future they made her a female Superman with half the characters that doesn’t even exist in the comics

You can not say leroy Jenkins because he does NOT exist in the DC Universe.

I loved this series until I stopped seeing it on Season 3, then I saw it again and I was like &quot;The fuck?....&quot;Really, is like, if a 10 year old kpop fan and extreme feminist would make a series without knowing how to make an action scene......... Changing it for a mexican telenovela drama lol. They really hate white men and make everything propaganda

&quot;I was at full strength and you defeat me&quot;Thats the problem, you DONT defeat superman casually

why was supergirl hiding behind a counter.. im pretty sure if something is too weak to get her through a counter it wont be strong enough to even tickle a kryptonian soo....

Dude i never saw those fuck no your wrong

I feel it&#39;s decent enough compared to the cgi I see in Indian movies and series

nice…
i swear dc shows used to be so good, supergirl was bad from the start, it was never about her powers, it was allways going to be about her gender and i knew it the day i saw the title and i was rightflash on the other hand was hella good at begining then it went downhill after season 3

&quot;Supergirl, You have been exposed to a lethal dose of kryptonite and shot with an M-16. If you don&#39;t receive medical treatment you will die&quot;Kara: &quot;Are you saying that because I&#39;m a woman?&quot;

i watch it for the fanfic

This is my favorite video of all time

why do you watch anime?why does anyone watch anything?people watch goku fight same villain for 50 episodes and become a super sayan at the end and kick the shit out of him cause he is goku

For anyone wondering at the time these DC CW shows got a budget of $2 million US per episode.For comparison the Marvel Netflix shows got $3.3 million (in the range of 3-4 mil) and the Disney+ shows get over $100 million for 6 eps

<a href="">4:24</a> lmao

bruh just call batman and problem solved

How is it a man can have a one night stand with a woman,  but that woman didnt have a one night stand?

RUDE

What I hate about DC is how predictable their movies are like goddamn I could predict most of what would happen in flash even though I&#39;ve never watched it. Courtesy of Supergirl. Here&#39;s just some things that happened in Supergirl that definitely happened in flash. 1. Supergirl became evil a bit. Same happened yo flash2. The tech guy feels useless and gets powers. Surprise surprise Cisco gets powers.3. A friend of the hero turns evil.

PewDiePie is mean to Supergirl!!!

if you actually watch this can you let me know why. actually so curious, unless ur a liberal or feminist, then ik why ur watching and boy do I feel sorry for you.

it isn’t that bad but the short man joke was bad (because I am a short man and it hurt me deeply)

Used to be cute in the 80s. But everything  with this woke generation is shite.

Sailor Moon liveaction is more cursed than this

u know i watched the flash and CGI killer frost looked like a rabbit

Broooooo this cracked me up hahaha

Feminists: normalize all bodiesAlso Feminists: <a href="">7:22</a>

unpopular opinion: by making every female hero revolve around her femininity and the empowerment of women you actually create inequality

All your base are belong to us.

And now the whole network is over... Goodbye CW!

My first P.P vid..DANG!!!!!!I luv this cat...

I watched all or most of the episodes I realized how cringe this crap is and stopped

Jesus fucking christ
Pewds: super girls is cringeSome stupid people: why? Be cause she is just a girl?

Sneaking in social justice propaganda? They weren&#39;t sneaking. They were blatantly in your face doing it. You watch stupid shit shows like Supergirl to avoid the real world, and then have the real world shoved down your throat. They did the same thing with Flash, and to a lesser extent Arrow.

Looks like something some high school students would make for a film project.

I’m glad the animators of The Amazing Bulk were able to find a job

Did He Hate?

The way CW sees and does feminism is a disservice to the cause to say the least.

Dude had to grab his balls to teleport 

everything that goes to cw/netflix will instantly become SJW movie.

y you doing this yyyyyy

how do you know what crystal meth looks like ????????

Shit I was enjoying supergirl , but politics ruined it.

Social Justice Girl fails compilation
This is the peak of humor <a href="">7:38</a>

They reused this scene <a href="">0:50</a> at <a href="">1:01</a>

If you want a good &quot;powerful&quot; female character go play red dead redemption 2. Sadie adler is the best executed &quot;independant woman&quot; character I&#39;ve ever seen

I’m glad it ended

I find PewDiePie videos I don&#39;t remember watching and realize I&#39;ve already liked them! Cool...

lol my sister watches supergirl

Sorry boring obehni like sodnani The soldier works and this is the best super hero 

Wait till Pewdiepie learns about Victor Magtanggol

WATCH VICTOR MAGTANGGOL ITS A FANTASY FILIPINO TV SERIES, ITS MORE GARBAGE THAN THESE XD

Felix kawaii

Actually season 1 are not so bad

I don&#39;t even get why it&#39;s cringe.
WoW just like what they release on Philippines but a &quot;much&quot; better effect just a lil but

Eh
The CW ruins superheroes period. This Supergirl is NOT Supergirl, she&#39;s Female Superman.

Lexie Grey looks old...meh

Most bollywood CGI films are like this - Robot or RA-ONE

Season 1 is good though

This is power rangers level cgi.

Supergirl and batwoman same crap going on, and the alphabet lot omG 

i watched it and i regret it

Why does PewDiePie always have to judge everything if you wanna be a judge go to college

Season 1 and 2 were alright. There was an awesome character that left season 3. Then it’s like the writing went to shit

BRO I dindt remember the cgi was this bad

If you think Supergirl was bad, try reviewing Batwoman i dare you:p

Then we have clint, <b>former</b> vfx artist at corridor, praising supergirl and saying &quot;WHAT?!? You haven&#39;t seen supergirl yet?!&quot; and still have the audacity to trashtalk marvel, without having seen any of the movies  see what you&#39;re doing DC? You&#39;re creating incompetent manchildren

Try watching the last season of Lucifer on Netflix lol

are the writers not aware ... that perhaps a one night stand is between 2 people?  meaning (using their example) when a man has a one night stand, the woman also has a one night stand?

 I felt bad for Melissa.
And then they would blame the failure to men being chauvinistic.

Its stupid, stupid then some more stupid

At least she is not super fat girl or super gay girl.

Lmao can&#39;t wait for you to react to CGI here in the Philippines. So bad you would think the production hired some guy down the street and gave it 50 bucks to create a CGI lava walker that actually looked like a walking hot garbage

Is this legit in the show,I don&#39;t remember it ,wtf

<a href="">0:25</a> Indian TV series: &quot;Let us introduce us&quot;

i have whatched half seazon but could not finish the whole season

&quot;We need your help&quot;&quot;Because I&#39;m black?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I have trouble speaking to women under c cup&quot;

Because I&#39;m _________?
Me being a supergirl super fan watching this cut deep

super girl is so cringe that i9 dont even want to continue watching this video

It was less cringe before season 5

Everything woke turns to shit -Donald Trump

<a href="">2:18</a> he is legit is making fun of brainy 

<a href="">1:16</a> ni*gas like
<a href="">1:16</a> WHAT DID HE SAY WHAT DID HE SAY !?

WTF IS THIS SHIT

No, That Alien just look like a bad CGI!

<a href="">1:02</a> since when did supergirl become the flash?

I really like Supergirl, but i need to agree with pewdiepie kkkkk

but yes supergirl and superman is cringe

I like CW shows but I instantly said yes to this video

Pewds should try watching superman &amp; lois

they edited that and this video is the reason I unsubscribed because beforesupergirl I wanted to di

the first time I watched Supergirl is like when I first saw Jimmy Olsen I thought he was Victor Stone lol. like since when did was Jimmy become a tall, muscular, charismatic looking black man? Tf really? 

nope CGI and special effects of indian dramas are worst

well, but Supergirl has Chris Wood  he is worth watching

Cw really fucked up

THE BEGINNING IS REALLY GREAT, BUT I LOST INTEREST AFTER A FEW SEASONS
Superman is also kinda cringe to be fair 

The first season is really amazing but when it comes to season 2-6 it just gets really boring..

I saw the first 2 seasons on of Supergirl and it was fantastic

I swear alot of digs were brought to males in this 

No he did not
Does he really not know that these is not the acctual CGI

Hey it&#39;s one of my fav shows and mellisa puts every bit of her acting in it and while th flying scenes her body really hurts

It is very cringe, i agree, but pewds is blindy hating without knowing the plot

I swear 8 year olds made this

super gir dose suck but green arow,flash and dc&#39;s legons of tomorow are ok

Marvel is way better

this is the worst roast of Supergirl from himHe doesn&#39;t even care that those are actors and the real power comes from specialeffects

PEWDIEPIE BAD

Bro Supergirl it&#39;s one of the best shows ever

Nice video

I feel bad for Melissa Benoist. I personally like Supergirl but obviously there are different opinions.

Super Girl is Super Bad.

Pewds, you have to see Riverdale

More proof that ideological messages ruin creative works.

It&#39;s actually really sad because Melissa Benoist is very talented and the CW is ruining her career

I was like 10 seconds in to the first clip and I couldn&#39;t watch anymore

And they say DC TV shows are Goated ffs

I might disagfee with this vid cause I love the series, so beat it

but have you seen the flash?

Pewdiepie bro u are litterally the last person to call cringe

I hate u I think super girl was amazing she’s pretty and they work so hard to make the season so if u think she’s cringe I think ur cringe

lol i actually like the series



The &quot;Me gusta&quot; just got me 

Pewds:you can whach anything else then this,all so pewds whaching supergirl for <a href="">10:28</a> minutes

Check your old numbers and your new numbers of viewss

Who says that honest why because she’s just a girl my god

You would have been better if you just respect others

Why do people claim that these FXs are ps2 graphics. It’s no where near ps2 graphics.  It’s classic Xbox graphics

Try Superman and Lois

dude u get followers just to attack other youtubers

Supergirl was really great in the first season, then decent in the next 4 seasons, then season 6 : total mushfest.

There is so many things wrong with this video it’s unexplainable

Hey, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that bad. Just because you don&#39;t like something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s boring. Clearly you haven&#39;t watched the twists and turns and schemes of Lex Luthor. Supergirl literally just gave us the best Lex Luthor.

Hey...Watch Superman and Lois... although its a spin-off of Supergirl, it totally gives the man of steel vibes. Doesn&#39;t look like its part of the Arrowverse. Seriously, I feel bad for Melissa, she&#39;s such an amazing actress, but the CW as always messed things up, by downsizing the budget and trying to put more CGI characters

wtf

Well the reason that super girl has bad ratings is because most people watch it on Netflix and not the CW and Netflix doesn&#39;t releas they raiting to the public

Instagram filters are better than this 

im a woman and i just barfed at this series&#39; pathetic way of shoving feminism and everything else down your throat

Love this

I watched the first episode and just forgot about it and went to finish the flash 4 times

Bruh... go see shakthiman... your mind will be blown to pieces

Well at least I&#39;ve heard Superman and Lois is good

Victor Magtanggol parin beh

gotta be honest with you, season 6 be kinda rockin&#39; so far

When people say aot has bad cgi These people have a lot more budget but look what they do with  it.

Pewds must have watched our indian serials with sub

LEEROY JENKINS !!!!

“We came prepared” Proceeds to get shot

I think they had indian editors do the cgi

What version is u watching

Less cringe then you 

DC fans be cancelling Pewdiepie lmao

<a href="">4:49</a> Legend says they are vexes

you are very cringe!!!

<a href="">3:24</a>you cant underestim8 the flash dawg, supergirl bad-the flash good

Do one on the flash

supergirl is good wdym

I wouldnt exactly add critic to ur job description

the imdb rating falls after pewdiepie uploaded the video

serious cringe hate supergirl
I watch season one. Supergirl was hot af. Now I don&#39;t recognize her. I stopped watching cause I wanted to be entertained, not being shoved a agenda down  my throat.

The problem with DC shows is that they always start good. And then the writers decide to turn the shows into just pure drama. They&#39;re just soap operas at this point.

this looks like old indian movies special effect

RIP DC.

Thats way better than victor magtanggol tho.

PewDiePie....i lost respect man...lost respect
Is pewdiepie not woke? Damn. That&#39;s awesome.

I think I need to thank Netflix for not featuring this series in my home country, otherwise I think I would’ve gouged my eyes out by now ‍️

Glad I never watched it.

because of this low budget tv series they destroy the DC&#39;s quality

Ngl even the power rangers cgi is better than this

Actually I rooted for Reign, the real Super Hero against Super Fraud.

Charmed from 1998 had better cgi.

Why is it that this gets more views than the actual series lololol ?

Tbh tho I liked s1 - s3 but after that it kinda started to get cringey  and stuff.

Leeroy Jenkins who&#39;s that 

1M people still watching are probably Karen...

Supergirl with super short dress,super lipstick and ...of my god I was turn of after 7min...is not shit is aps..shit

Ive never seen super girl but I assume that it’s the best thing ever because it has Jeremy Jordan aka JACK FRICKIN KELLY FROM NEWSIES.

Supergirl has the same cgi as the erly power rangers

I got a feminist ad after the video ended

Right before watching this I saw a video talking about when you said you didn’t like Marvel movies

No. Saying the N-word unprovoked is cringe

I’m unsubing
That promo is fake asl

<a href="">0:02</a> money laundering laundering   lol
I have watched it since it aired for reference I’m 11

I don’t understand how using overhyped feminism and man shaming is supposed to get men to like you? It literally does the opposite

What so funny bruh

How is the CGI bad in the Flash and Supergirl but Superman and Lois has better cgi.

<a href="">0:54</a>That&#39;s bad cgi? Might as well watch shows  made here in Philippines. It&#39;s crappy asf

I 100% agree 
DO BATWOMANS TRAILER NEXTTTT

he needs to react to all of the cringy arrowverse shit bro if it wasnt a CW asset the arrowverse would be fuckin epic

I used to watch the flash and the arrow then supergirl came out and that was bad and the arrow and the flash turned to shit so i stopped watching the cw shows all together

I liked it..

The first and second season off flash are actually really good but the rest sucks

I like how they ask for a kickass women instead of white men but the woman they get is not black

Dudes don’t have one night stands alone there has to be a woman present aswell or whatever you’re into it still takes two

Flash:whooshes hand in circles really fastMe:IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCES

Ewww this guy is super cringe. More than Supergirl.

I literally can&#39;t watch any more. The worst part is that my 8 year old little brother is addicted to it

I feel zero pity for the actors. They could have quit, literally 5 years of filming this trash. Ignorance is not bliss.... whatsoever Ahaha

Still better than captain marvel.

Cw is so bad they should of stayed with CBS it was so goos

Pewdiepie: Supergirl is cringe.The rest of the Arrowverse shows: Are we a joke to you?

I dropped after 1st episode  guess i was right

Who this video has a dislike? Hahaha

Even Bollywood is better than this

The first clip looks like a Ugandan movie made in America

How Dare You

<a href="">9:26</a> how to be sexist to both men and women at the same time.

The fact that they literally pushed every trait transgender ,gays ,female villains ,female heroes ,female victims  ,and just sidelined every single male character , I mean I don&#39;t have a prob with showing a lead female that&#39;s awesome ,but u just can&#39;t sideline every other gender characters with petty lines , no power and ultimately just sending em off in future ,or whatever.. that didn&#39;t look like feminism , rather monarchy After S4 everything was just From one gender point of view , Rich ones HeroesVillains Victims It became terrible and super cringe for a reasonEspecially that dialogue &quot;that&#39;s such a guy thing to do&quot; ughhhhhhhh

I liked the first 3

YouTubers roasting cringe content because they ran out of ideas, Well they never had any to begin with.

SuperGirl:I have the worst CGI in the TV historyFilipino CGI: are you sure bout that?

It was from DC what do you expect

I heard one of the episodes are good

The cringe lv is over 9000Tbh i enjoyed supergirl season1 and 2..After that lost complete interestMaybe i was 1 of the 10m viewer...but not in 1m 

No its not chringe you are chringe

Looking back, this was such virtue-signalling bullshit. Superman is substantially stronger than Supergirl because he’s older and has been absorbing the sun longer. So they are literally going against the logic of the universe just for woman stronk.

some of the cgi in cw shows actually reminds me of power rangers

pewds, you are more entertaining than anything Marvel or DC is doing right now.

This video looks like shit. It looked waaaay better on Netflix.

pewdie pies video got more views than the entire season 6 of supergirl lol

They try to equalize so much it becomes racist and sexist

Meanwhile PewDiePie reacting to TikToks...

Ok, now i am not sure supergirl isn&#39;t made in my India.

The Villain is Satan from Montero call me by your name LMAO

Pewds died here he got worse in every way

Basically: You can do anything you want with your life. Why the fuck are you watching Supergirl?

Marzia POV: Felix yelling “PeNiS SmAlLlLlL”
Most of the time it&#39;s the writers. God damn

Welcome to America.

That Me Gusta bit at the end was hilarious

Filipino tv is more bad effects

*calls plumber*:Hey i need you to come fix my bathroomPlumber:Why? Cos im black?And then everyone gave him a standing ovation.

He should watch Legends of Tomorrow....It is so awful that is actually funny and the creators know this fact and enjoys making it crazier xd

Anytime a guy has a one night, a girl also has a one nightJust sayin

I started watching super girl from season 6 episode 1 and it was so damn cringe compared to the flash but they should be somewhat similar so I was confused

His channel went from gaming to <a href="">8:55</a>

Bro that Thumbnail is Super Cringe.

No one can get that duck laugh out of you
Reviewer pewd when 

It has always bothered me that the Flash would be good-like unstoppable if he wanted to. But all they have him do is run circles around someone and make tornadoes. It&#39;s literally the most ineffective thing you could do with super speed. If I were the Flash it’d just kick everyone&#39;s nutts off instantly. Heads would be exploding left an right.

Simp no other reason 

All the dislikes are the snowflake woman XD

Everybody all at once: &quot;HES BLACK TOO!!!&quot;

Tip for movie directors :Stop trying so hard.

Bruh u should review some bangladeshi superhero movies XD

Who fund these shows? Ans: Feminist lobby

This should&#39;ve been under cringe... Horrid lmao

<a href="">10:00</a> that basically happened in season 1 when supergirl met James.

SupergirlGOD

This can’t be real

Screams Leroy Jenkings and slides.. gets shot multiple times

Dont you der talk about supergirl like that

This video got 7x the views of a supergirl episode

HEY! Don&#39;t talk shit about the PlayStation 2 &gt;:(

A lot of feminist fairies and white knights in the comments lol

Just imagine if Chris wood see&#39;s this vid. Pewd is doomed.

Supergirl was just famous because of the series flash

wow supergirl is fucking sexist as hell! And even racist!

I love and hate Supergirl at the same time. CW sucks ;-; But I love the cast and I&#39;ll keep watching &#39;cause I&#39;m a clown. The CGI is truly sad...

They got really politically correct and ignored comic accuracy story’s and plots.

Super Girl&#39;s issue is that they either did too much, or too little, no in between.

You are a hater

I wonder what marzia was thinking

Pewdiepie hasn&#39;t saw indian TV shows.

power rangers look better
Such behavior and attitude by these people is exactly what makes me hate feminism.In the past I could say, you know what, not all women are like that. Also the feminist movement is great, it helped a lot of people (talking about 2nd wave of the 70-90s).But today&#39;s 3rd wave feminism is so toxic it is no better than the manipulative 1st wave feminism that was disingenuous and corrupt. Is that the legacy of feminism?Such shows like Supergirl and Batwoman with their sexist toxic messages are what push me to hate SJW, feminism and even LGBT+ completely and unreasonably. All because of these shows and their relentless pursuit of insulting all of our intelligence. If they want to be able to play the victim card eternally, then I don&#39;t mind providing them with my hate.Congratulations, you have played yourself.

Better than hindi serial
This looks like Power Rangers

If you want an awesome Supergirl, read the comics.

How can this video get 15k dislikes...I don&#39;t understand these people

poor real life real life is boring without flying lol

The other shows are better...Other shows being the arrowverse shows...

<a href="">3:57</a> so why is it exactly that she sounds like she inhaled Sulfur Hexaflouride? just seems weird but there&#39;s probably <b>some kind of reason</b>

you know, when I watched the first scene on Netflix, it was dramatic and I was into it, but with Pewds voice over, I cant unsee them

I watched this when I was 4 you ruined my damn childhood

Supergirl is awesome

Judging by the dislikes, it seems the Supergirl fanbase has dipped to 15 thousand.

Brazzers have better cgi than this.

It got worse as they became more feminist

Nah Supergirl was good

She says your not from this planet she’s a alien as well

&quot;why cause she&#39;s a woman&quot;also her &quot;cant make conversation with men under 6 ft tall&quot;

Yea supergirl got bad idk why some people watch it

Pewds should checkout flash season 7 if he think’s this is bad

i promise the first seasons were better

PS2 CGI whateven kratos look better then this alien in PS2

I swear I have seen a bad adult movie version of the Promo and I literally can&#39;t tell the difference. Is it just me?! Please say someone else shares this or I am worried for myself...

When marvel pays you.

I’m mad at a god and can’t do anything

&quot;The Flash&quot; is better

<a href="">01:34</a> that looks like Billy

PewDiePie
 is super cringe too

How the hell does older movies like batman begins and many others have better CGI than this?

I hate to say it pewdiepie, it&#39;s a Sci-fi and Martian looks exactly like that in the comics. Read some comics before making your video. In the TV series there is always little budget. Without whole story you can&#39;t make jokes by taking a cut. You are really disgusting when it comes to women.

Ngl, I thought Pewds was Mon El for a sec..

And this is why I am not subscribed

You don’t even know what is going on there and just say its bad just shut up

Y&#39;all Haven&#39;t seen this episode to begin with... I have and it&#39;s actually really cool

Smallvilles 3rd worst episode is better than this

Good bad ass shit fucks

It’s CGI

Do greys anatomy next!!!

Super girl is super cringe.  .

I thought the person in the thumbnail was taylor swift at first 

total arrowverse vfx is shit

I am a white caucasian straight male and i was watching supergirl for long time ago, event tho it wasnt really good i was still enjoying it at some degree but then of course best way to cut off white caucasian straigth male audience is to make them the white caucasian straight males villain of the story,  just being white caucasian straight males.

I offically hate you for this

I love supergirl and all, but this is so true! the first two seasons they actually put in some effort but now they just wingin it

supergirl is bad but arrow and flash is good

This alien looks like piccolo from Dragon Ball Evolution 

Don’t you dare insault super girl
Supergirl&#39;s first season banged but then it died fast

Most DC shows are just CW soap operas, except for Superman and Lois and Doom Patrol.

aCTUALLY..T-SERIES SPONSORED SUPERGIRL

Damn pewds really lools like fat pewds in this vid.

Bollywood writers: &quot;write that down WRITE THAT DOWN&quot;

All the likes: Marvel FansAll the dislikes: people with actual good taste in superhero shows

You suck man
Searched up can you die from cringe and this came up. Supergirl is rlly that bad

I have seen fan films with better visual effects, acting and dialogues.

I Wonder What if they make &quot;Wonder man&quot;

People be watching supergirl and saying anime is trash

She caught a bullet with one hand while spinning and shooting lasers from her eyes

supergirl is cringe and flash seasons 1-3 are good and almost all arrow seasons are good except season 8

ok ur not wrong but if u come after flash i will be angry

I mean, it is bad sometimes but most of the scenes are out of context. For example, that women who said 6 feet tall man thing. She is supposed to be a bitch not a &quot;powerful woman&quot;

You sould watch the flash series

i smell sexism

They trynna make women look bad ass while in reality they are just naturally not bad ass

Nah super girl is super good.

The women in Supergirl are more sexist than the people they&#39;re accusing

I bet all the dislikes are from feminists and supergirl fans

This vid got more views than the recent seasons combined

I wanna see pewdiepie without special effects now

half of these clips are fake and forr the rest he just looks at the worst onr

and when he says &quot;why because im black?&quot; THAT CLIP IS NOT REAL I CAN SEND YOU A REAL CLIP OF WHEN HE SASYS &quot;im sorry j&#39;onn but i think im gonna go back to my hometown&quot;

The guy: we came prepared. The teacher with a bullet of secret surprise test:

The CGI looked like we&#39;re still in 2010 or 2012 lol. EVEN THEY HAD IT BETTER LOL!

This is more viewed than all of season 2 and onwards of Supergirl combined lmao

This is literally worse than Power rangers+

The reason I stopped watching it after a season

Big cgi fight
Its still better than this whiny video maker.

Anyone else sus that the writers of super girl are feminists?

<a href="">7:37</a> evidence of pewdiepie and pink man are the same person

I&#39;m just watching supergirl to watch the arrowverse in chronological order

It s amazing how those series are so anti male and so anti white but that&#39;s okay with them.Pathetic.

Why do they keep this trash?Because of the feminist propaganda.

lmao

this is one of my favorite shows

It&#39;s the <b>insert feminist sparkles</b> body shaming <b>insert feminist sparkles</b> for me

Martian manhunter the best CGI I ever seen

Supergirl is amazing so is the entire arrowverse, you can’t judge it if you don’t know what’s going on. It’s amazing that’s a fact

Basically feminist is just a bully specific for pointing out men insecurities and gets mad when they r being pointed out the same thing

If it&#39;s bad why hasn&#39;t Crayistaken made a video saying how much it sucks?

Purplerodri shouldn&#39;t have been cancelled.

do one for the flash

Bro just go watch zach Snyder&#39;s justice league then lets talk about bad cgi

I don&#39;t remember Xena warrior princess being forgettable. WTF happened in just 10/15 years?? As a girl of the 2000s I&#39;m disappointed U_U

im mildly offended. but i understand.

But bad whamen god
The Flash it’s a good series tho

Keep thinking my eyes are going bad, but then I remember, I have a rubbish camera

A for the Effort, but not the quality of the message Supergirl tries to give... :&#39;)

I just wanted to say that Jesus loves you very much and died for you. You can accept Jesus as your savior anytime you want. If you want to know more about accepting Jesus I suggest that you go to the website of Calvary chapel Church in la Verne and watch one of their videos on salvation good morning. Tell him Peter sent you.

SUPERGIRL IS GREAT! YOU ARE NOT I DONT WATCH YOU PEWDIEPIE

NO ITS NOT WTH NO

&quot;Being shy is a superpower&quot;&quot;Is math related to science?&quot;

I hate u bc u hate supergirl
I think they hired ekta kapoor for this

The flash series is super cool,my mind can’t be changed

one thing we should not watch is pewdiepie

pewdiepie should watch it before he gouges everything

pewdiepie is so weird he tries to act like he is better then any one and who sales there merch for 30 dollers and what name is pewdiepie is he a pie

At time <a href="">8:44</a> , he is an alien he is not black.  Shapeshifter

This is so painful for people who actually read the comics

super turd
Supergirl defeating Superman is just funny

Ok super girl is shit comparison to the arrow and flash

ps2 didn&#39;t look that bad. It&#39;s more like ps1 CGI

Meanwhile Flash in Supergirl&#39;s earth : Let&#39;s calm down and handle this like women.

<b>Super Cringe</b> LOL 
I love Supergirl

Wait till he see Victor magtangol

you know that  the cw also did the flash and if they can do effect that well it should not have been different for any other one.

Which is worse?SupergirlShitty Ben 10 RebootPowerpuff girls 2016Powerpuff girls live action rebootFairly Odd Parents live action rebootBatwomanTeen Titans Go!Fairly Odd Parents (Season 10)

A god-like alien fighting small robots, makes sense

Thank god this crapfest is being cancelled.And no, it’s not just “ending” like the CW wants you to believe.  It was CANCELLED.

This never gets old

Wait , it&#39;s already been a year since this was uploaded ?

well, for one thing, we&#39;ve got a hood. It&#39;s very nice.

Sooo glad I stopped at season 3

DC movies and tv series are cringe

Flash and arrow are better

This looks like one of those african movies 

o my god not you too

&quot;We came prepared.&quot; Next cut - he holds his hands behind his back.

i watched the first two season of supergirl, but form season 3 it sucks.

Clearly a fan made series

1 though 4 is good 5 eh

EEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Please watch the series before hating. I really liked season 3-

This channel is horrible and I hate it

Super Girl used to be good but it has gotten way more cringey since I cancelled my satellite tv. I used to watch all those DC shows, my favourite was Flash.

All superhero or hero related tv shows felt cringe to me after the flash came out as a series. I legit couldn&#39;t watch after 10mins.

I thought this was old Power Rangers

Men are hated so much by women and at the same time those women want respect from them . Wow. Fuck these misandrists.

<a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/DHjzXuycFcSrgQeKn5KQDg"></a><a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/DHjzXoqdFcSrgQeKn5KQDg"></a><a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/DHjzXqWdFcSrgQeKn5KQDg"></a><a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/8i7lXqeIFuCBx_APxOOy2Ac"></a>
That last part imply a that all men are gay XD

this serie is good

SUPERGIRL IS SUPERAWESOME!!!

Supergirl is good, the video he watched just makes it look bad, and that’s why people think it’s so funny, you don’t know the backstory and how it actually works. They edited it to make it look weird. Haters bruh

Me who watches Supergirl for Katie McGrath and Supercorp:     ._.

one of the main villains is just a racist lol, just dislikes aliens.

superman and lois is so much better

I&#39;m just watching it for the hopes of having Supercorp

Imagine if pewds watched Netflix&#39;s Daredevil 

Why are you trying to make yourself laugh. I think  you cringy in this video

Gays watch it for Supercorp lmao, same tho tbh

And the way she&#39;s changing to supergirl outfit running to the camera is stupid also

Why..

I mean he is right but why talk about shows without even watching them.

First I felt bad that their views were trash but after the propoganda it is well deserved

<a href="">3:24</a>&quot;SAY HELLO TO MY DIVINE SANDSTORM!!!!&quot;

When you hate supergirl, but you have to watch it to understand the crossover episodes

<a href="">0:34</a> is that the actor who played Wayne Rigsby in The Mentalist?!

i kinda enjoyed it tho

Not you coming after super girl

<a href="">7:57</a> Supergirl really had an &quot;And everyone clapped&quot; moment, seriously?

I like the video but why didnt you took the data of the whole world maybe the world picture is beter and i just started watching season 1 and i like it but there some obvius bad things about it that is just my opinion.

PewDiePie is the boss !

Even the CGI of Stargate was better than this xD

Your telling me this isn&#39;t power rangers?

He&#39;s making fun of  the silly  special effect,obviously he haven&#39;t watch VICTOR MAGTANGGOL

What would they measure it with? It’s not like they’ve ever been in a hardware store to get a tape measure

This is heresy to the original comics, Supergirl is such an amazing character

Henry Cavil is buff af

Watch  anime it is so much better

we need to get pewdiepie number one again

honestly i just watched it for chris wood/mon-el

dude that how CGI on tv series in my country

fac ju

The flash and arrow were okay but I would rather pull the eyes out of my sockets and eat them than watch supergirl

The Flash is better. It got worse when Hartley Sawyer got canceled.

Pewds: This CGI is so badd..Filipinos: you haven&#39;t seen the worstIndia: uhh, well..

I have seen supergirl it is not like thus and cgi is much better in the real series

I feel so bad for Melissa Benoist because the first season was good and she&#39;s a fantastic actress. She was really good in the Waco mini-series. The problem is going from CBS to CW

supergirl feels like a low buget indian drama

how the fk this guy uploaded such a stupid video on my birthdate..come on man,, u just giving those stupid cringe creators the public attention

i watched it 2015¨

Istg these fucking effects remind me of these indian effects dead ass

&quot;You are ...&quot;&quot;Why because im ...!?&quot; Shut up

How they going to say having a 1 night stand is a guy thing WHEN THE GUY HAS IT WITH A GIRL LMAOOO

pfft is it me or does it sound like he is saying the n word <a href="">1:16</a> lol

Supergirl is f**ked up.

The Superman scene where “she beat him” really ticked me off. If this was actually accurate, it wouldn’t even be a fight. Superman would beat the ever-living shit out of supergirl without breaking a sweat.

︎ 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗩𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼
<a href="">10:12</a> i spit out my cereal

À 21admitting shevis a drag queen, terr8ble guy.

I understand why he’s not a huge fan of this, but if he starts throwing shade at The Flash or Arrow, imma get upset. But he does have good reasoning.

Ye when I heard “Super Girl” I knew there was going to be feminism involved

How dare you hate Supergirl

Atleast arrow is good

I don&#39;t like supergirl either also other dc live-action series ever  they really suck

FUCK OF I LOVE SUPER GIRL FLAH AND STUF

Bruh you dont even watch dc so shut up
<a href="">6:21</a> Is this Pew News?

How the hell could they have Supergirl beat Superman when I couldn&#39;t beat him even with the power of the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.

Supergirl thinks she can be more cringe than me.That&#39;s why she got cancelled.She tried to be more cringe than Johnny Test.

Supergirl is so cringe if Goku cant defeat Superman, theres no way Superputa could beat Superman.

But it is good,as I have seen in YouTube.

&quot;I&#39;m a youtuber, look at me! I make videos based on the hottest hate trends, look at me! My job is to fuck up the world even more, look at me! I am so relevant, look at me! Hating makes me cool, look at me! I complain about cringe tv shows while I make cringe youtube videos, LOOK. AT. ME!&quot; Fucking &quot;influencers&quot;, ugh -_- The.Worst.Go and try to be relevant, interesting and an actual good rolemodel, for once. All of you &quot;influencers&quot;. Ya&#39;ll worse than politicians. Fuck.

The heck

Can you do one with other DC shoes too... Mainly Arrowverse... Arrow is amazing if u ask me....️️

supergirl has that authentic philippine television series elements

this is exactly like Indian serial

Want to know why Supergirl is so bad after the first season? ANSWER: Because people realized that it is just a copy of Superman but a woman version with more a less all women supervillains

I like it not as bad as batwomen

Finally someone fucking gets that these shows are shit



Actually the CGI was better before ...but as it went on, it got poorer and poorer

Supergirl is good bruh

I think what annoys people the most about these stupid social justice bits is because the whole argument that &quot;angry old white men&quot; think women cant be strong or superheroes or whatever just isnt true. They are trying to fight a fight that doesnt exist. Female superheroes have been around for as long as male superheroes. But the people behind these shows want the public to think that women are oppressed in the worlds most freedom based country. Anything to make a white man look bad lets fabricate a fake narrative that anyone with two brain cells will know is just not realistic.

&quot;This guys says, &#39;we came prepared&#39; - immediately gets shot XD&quot;&quot;We came prepared - I don&#39;t have a gun&quot;<i>This is literally DC&#39;s most intelligent character</i>

They did the leroy jenkins thing in the flash aswell

I stopped watching it when they said something stupid about the skirt. Then they started making it political about aliens not belonging to the world. Then worse things kept coming. 2nd or 3rd season I dipped. I didn’t even finish tithe season, I just said BYE 

Now seeing supergirl cgi I can tell they spent all the buget on the flash lol

Better than ur channe

poopdiedie
&quot;We need you&quot;-Black guy&quot;Because I&#39;m Black!?!&quot;- other black guy&quot;...nevermind I&#39;ll do it.&quot;-Black guy

It&#39;s not that bad of the cgi  on netflix

I am a DC fan but I agree with you

Every episode is 3 milWhere is that 3 mil going

Supergirl is the best Melissa plays it great this guy needs to shut the hell up He does not know what he’s talking about the arrow verse rocks it’s all you people that say no and that’s why the shows ending

This is why Marvel is better

The responsible representative resultspreviously unlock because memory characteristically admit under a fantastic blow. fancy, staking trigonometry

i dont whatch supergirl but i watch the flash and they have had a few cross overs and when ever she comes its so CRINGE

The first fight scene looks like an indian tv serial fight 

I was depressed and going through some financial crysisAnd now I&#39;m laughing    

WHO THE HELL IS THAT BUFF KOREAN CHICK GOD DAMN!

a bald man driking milk is the prime example of being  a mega chad hahahaha

supergirl is one of my favorite shows 

I used to watch Arrow/Flash and then Supergirl as well but it&#39;s definitely the weakest of the CW DC shows. The other ones also dipped in quality after a while.

<a href="">7:55</a> Goku laughed so hard after hearing that shit that he ended up destroying the planet

I agree, Supergirl: Man bAd! Reality: Both are good. and I agree that a female superhero is a good idea but not when they&#39;re pressuring men of their own existance.

<a href="">0:55</a> HOLY SHIT THAT&#39;S LEXIE FROM GREYS ANATOMY

Better than Indian serials ngl

Relax man, I don&#39;t like it either.

Brazzer&#39;s supergirl parody has better CGI

I like it!
<a href="">3:16</a> Markiplier was chuckling at this.

the hip thrust of the flash at <a href="">4:01</a> hahahaha

Tbh supergirl used to be good but now it&#39;s shit

Finally you talk about the Arrowverse!!!! Yes!!!! Arrow and The Flash are my favorite shows of all time man!

I didn&#39;t even know werewolfs can be superheros now....

<b>lowkey thought that was power rangers</b> 

This series are just indian Hollywood version of serials 

Those bad CGI stuff were clearly a PR campaign to get people to talk, no such thing as bad publicity with these people.

Degeneracy in this video is insane

Pew die pie is alien 
I was wondering where his accent went in all his  laughing till it just surfaced after it started (ironic, he&#39;s Swedish, just like Greta Thunberg!)

The really bad part is that these shows go on for ages and ages.

SuperGirl is one of the best TV Shows. Why? Because she inspires people! She reminds me that there is always hope and faith. That&#39;s what&#39;s all about.

Watching this video after Wandavision just makes it sad.

Bruh
PewDiePie&#39;s videos used to be better.....

I know what would bring back viewers if DIO was the villain

Power Rangers had better cgi than that clip and I mean the og power rangers

about @<a href="">4:00</a> in, my mind should not have been in the gutter, but I guess I&#39;m in good company

I find it so incredibly ironic that the social justice warriors/left that talk/have the same views as seen in this script are generally far more bigoted towards men/white people themselves than the bigotry they&#39;re so against.Bigotry is bigotry. Doesn&#39;t matter who it&#39;s against, it&#39;s never okay. If you talk like this then you ARE sexist/bigoted/toxic.

Everything&#39;s fine until a 7 y/o finds SFX software

Flash is good tho

<a href="">0:55</a> who&#39;s that actress? wow she&#39;s got Cate Blanchett vibe :&gt;

cw 

Worst CGI? All of you need to watch Filipino Movies.Btw, I may not like Supergirl, but I really appreciate their efforts and it looks a quite good.

At first i was like &quot;what the hell is this&quot;But then i understand whats happenning because i watched it

NOW! DO BATWOMAN SUPPER CRINGE!

Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow are pretty good. Flash started good and got ruined by the producers. Supergirl had great potential that didn’t get used.

We small guys get picked on quite frequently, rip 

Yh supergirls shit but the flash and arrow are the best

Great you should watch Zack Snyder justice league

they look like crystal meth....

NO!!!!!!!!!!!
The first two seasons were ok, but then they got super political and feminist and it just sucked ass after that. Marvel is the Goat of Superhero Movies and Shows. Periodt.

i-i actually liked it :(

Supergirl was good u til it went so far woke

Can men judge the women&#39;s boobs and their &quot;periods&quot; as well?!If those feminist want to force men to behave nasty they could just said it out straight...

Wtf i didn&#39;t even know supergirl existed until i watched this video

Who do All the Characters In supergirl Even Female Characters Sound like Their Balls Dropped.

Piewdiepu your to young to watch this

SJW writing: Always a substitute for actual talent. Always.

I don’t like super girl but I loved the flash and arrow

I like

WAIT THATS AN ACTUAL CLIP??? BRO 

Ngl i love all cw shows expcwpt for batwoman supergirl does need a little bit of work her and there the rest of the areowverse cw shows are amzing including black lightning

I think i watched the wrong supergir...Wait...that was original.

Let him a watch south Indian movie 

I’m a DC fan so I’ve watched all these CW shows and I regret it for the most part. The first few seasons of arrow is great and the first flash season is amazing fr

flash is the best

I just watched five seasons of Supergirl in 3 weeks and I have to wait until March 30th for season 6 to come out and I have to wait a week for the flash season 7 episode 3 to come out I&#39;m pissed

Best comp to that CGI is power rangers

I watched the series to see is there realy so bad cgi, but i played it (the scene with flying robots), and it looked completly different.

I got a T-Series ad on the fricking video

pretty similar to power rangers

Watching for 2nd time so funny

This video has 7 times as many views as supergirl

They just cancelled it

Super girl unlike the flash or arrow (its brother shows) would focus on really girly stuff but they clearly didnt know that majority of their viewers were the males from its brother shows so ofcoz it was gonna lose its viewers

<a href="">4:40</a> there fighting bee drills from Pokémon

This is why I never take DC so seriously

&gt;_&gt;

that Leeroy Jenkins voice line really got me lol

That first clip was supposed to get my attention? This looks like the 90s Power Rangers

<a href="">3:07</a> Is this the first &quot;see the graph&quot; reference ever?

Supergirl got so bad because they started being all so pc and add useless information to characters which simply didn’t need to be added

&lt;3

i watch because of the ship with supergirl and lena luthor

I’m going to be honest supergirls cgi is bad but the other shows like Flash, arrow and others do a much better job.

That women&#39;s a fucking Karen she to fuckibg op and she&#39;s a Karen the cat lady a Karen

At least he didn&#39;t talk about the flash or i would&#39;ve been pissed

You should watch Shaktiman

PEWDIEPIE you mister imma unsub
this is bad,but have you ever watch ouija shark?

Katie Mcgrath, that&#39;s why

I love the CW verse, but I ain&#39;t watched it since crisis on infinite earths and I don&#39;t remember it being this bad 

I&#39;m really glad that The Flash doesn&#39;t have those kind of scenes that Supergirl has.

<a href="">4:01</a> why is flash humping the air 

Me: “why are they fighting my childhood bionicle collection?”Pewds less than a minute later: “why are they fighting bionicles”Me: YES HE IS SUPREMELY CULTURED

They tried to go full woke or broke

But felix i like it :(

Being boy is so cringe

That first short is fake !!!!!  It was aA experimental scène!

CW pulling out money for Superman and Lois: I&#39;m RichCW pulling out money for Supergirl: I tired

Fact: this vid is exactly 1 year old today

Flash and arrow is good but super girl is fucking terrible

Worst CGI EVER

Waiting for the triggered feminist to come and call you misogynist 

Supergirl is a really good concept and the characters are super cool but it’s just the writing and the budget that makes it trash :/

“Difficulty making conversation with men under 6 feet tall”<b>is still taller than her with heels on</b>

<b>But she kinda bad tho</b>

Indian TV Serials : finally a worthy opponent

Bruh, you have to review Batwoman

I remember enjoying like the first two seasons but then stopped watching same with the flash I got to  the fourth season and stopped.

Dang, I kinda stopped watching Supergirl after S1 and haven&#39;t watched since. Didn&#39;t realize how bad it went after I stopped watching

Great, now everyone will hate on people who watches Supergirl.

I hate when movies do things like that“You can’t do this”“Why, cause I’m a woman?”“No because you’ll be obliterated before you can do anything”

WAH BOUT TEM BOOTAY SHOTS

What you saw in the first minute of that trailer is called rapid fire stupidity, they throw everything at you all at once hoping you&#39;ll miss most of it

Respect his opinion although, I kinda liked Supergirl

&quot;Wha? Cuz I&#39;m black?&quot;Ask the black man to a black man

Yo,I love pewds!!
Still better compare to what we have here in the Philippines &quot;Victor Magtangol&quot;

When a YouTuber spends an hour in front of a camera and has 3 times the number of average viewers than a multi million dollar series

It shood be called super E girl

In my country, in philippines cgi is worst than that

It&#39;s edited it&#39;s fake

At <a href="">1:02</a> after she catches the bullet they pause her movement and drag her image across the screen lol

I swear that they changed the actor for super girl cause it did used to be rlly good :/

I actually like Supergirl 

As a 5&#39;10 man, I have a hard time talking to women under 5&#39;5.

<b>E</b>

Do you watch flash?

Its no coincidence that pewds made this video and supergirl is ending shortly after

My respect for u :️️
My dream is to become an actor. These scenes make me rethink my life decisions <a href="">3:18</a>

And please don&#39;t get me started on the episode on Gun Control in Arrow. I could swear it was written by Tommy Wiseau.

Bring back this beard

I watched the arrow and flash

At least he isnt hating the flash

the weirdest thing tho would be supergirl at <a href="">4:54</a> without special effects

Yea and yet somehow flash is better I actually like flash especially the first seasons

But melissa benoist is so pretty

kara looked so cool when she is in the flash so i started watching supergirl....huge mistake

I like Supergirl NOT
Pewdiepie has more viewers than supergirl

POV: you are here after it got canceled

ngl i watch flash and ive never questioned how trash the effects and cgi are lmao but ig i used to watch power rangers as a kid so idk

Supercringe huh?
That feeling when you're thinking about a new movie but you were on the homepage and it shows you a movie from a year ago
Fact : Supergirl is Far Stronger than Superman in Comics

Cut her some slack

We watch it cause we can&#39;t do anything anymore! HAHAHAHAHAHA

a spin-off of &#39;The Flash&#39; and &#39;Arrow&#39; that was &quot;side-kick&quot; worthy at best - non-male superheroes have strong bones just keep the lead&#39;s private porn pics, I don&#39;t know, private?

<a href="">3:25</a>WAMMMUUUU

power ranger level shit rh
<a href="">7:25</a> hits hard when ur 1 inch off

Why did I get randomly unsubscribed from pewds, what&#39;s YouTube doing?

Really Felix? Is that what cristal meth looks like to you?

Supergirl is trash but my trash; As a series she is very bad the truth but she is my guilty taste
how is the first clip simultaneously in color and in black in white

Supergirl cant even hit a million viewers.American Dad is a million times better.

LabRats has better cgi and vfx. just let that sink in. A low budget disney sitcom

Let&#39;s stop discrimination against black people and women by discriminating white men!

Too be fair, its CW

The first clip is fake btw

The flash was great until season 4 now it is too Comical

First vid i have seen of u and i already dont like u. Supergirl is amazing and is inspiring.

Pewds cancelled Supergirl ;-

waiting for the angry feminist

Arrowverse rated Best to worst Arrow FlashBatwoman Supergirl

Supergirl is good!!!!!!!!! Watch it on Netflix!!!

bro... did you really change their voices? this is also one of my favorite shows in the arrowverse. bahah

super girl great!
ME GUSTA

they should get abby from the last of us 2 to play super girl

I’m sorry but kara’s hair in season 5 is so horrible the bangs and the hair length does not look good

Supergirl does seem pretty bad, I like the flash though

marley from glee was done dirty :&#39;D

i seen better cgi in a episode of power rangers

What the fuck this is one of my favorite shows

The CW should just spend their money on all american and the flash

I can&#39;t believe this piece of shit tv series continued to 6 seasons!!!

zzz
At least it’s not as bad as batwoman

<a href="">0:09</a> Hey Supergirl is dookie but The Flash is where it&#39;s at. Or it was at least ffs. Arrow was the best hands down

Women: &quot;Whaaah! Women are judged harshly by society!&quot;Also women: &quot;sorry I can&#39;t take a man under 6 feet seriously!&quot;

It honestly reminds me of power rangers

This is so old

Honestly I don&#39;t understand how I lasted 2 seasons

I&#39;m late to this but idcMen- You cant pee standing up you dont have a ppWomen- Why because she&#39;s a girl

We dont like this at all

I&#39;m watching it right now and it&#39;s really good

I used to watch the flash back then. It honestly wasnt bad but as I got older the CGI just looked way worse and I lost Interest. These tv shows are for the younger audiences and 60 yr old people who dont even pay attention to CGI.

Leeeeeeroyyyyyy jenkins
what the phuc man

NOOOO HE CHANGED HIS PFP BACK FROM JAPAN SINKS?!?!??

<a href="">9:10</a> You see if this was Henry Cavill, it would’ve been different

Considering pewds has 100x their viewers in subs, they should actually listen

omg hahaha

Look I watched it and I didn’t think it was that bad‍️ some parts are bad I won’t lie, but most of the time it’s actually pretty decent. There are way better shows tho

I love how he says it should be canceled and it actually is.

Supergirl got cancelled lmao

Flash is better

You can make fun of super girl but the flash noooo

The flash is way better than this for me

<b>Girl?  How dare you assign a gender.  It is SUPERPERSON!</b>

Smert people: Supergirl don’t you have to wait for the other hero’s Supergirl: why cause I am a women Smert people: ya know what yea that’s why fucken hell

Justin Y. in <a href="">4:17</a>

Pewds: supergirl&#39;s cgi is badFilipinos: u sure?

PewDiePie: this series sucks Malayalis: you never seen a malayalam serial

Pewds:WHY IS SUPERGIRL AIRING.ITS SOOO BADme who has watched bollywood movies n tv series:heh its good

Imagine a guy&#39;s dialogue in a movie/ TV series which goes something like this...&quot;I have difficulties having a conversation with fat women&quot;. Kaboom!!

U know those toy bord thingys are meant to be toys right?

Most of the CW DC shows have bad CGI

Arrow is better

season 2 is actually good

Supergirl sucks but arrow and flash are really good well now it’s shit but the first seasons are amazing

Supergirl is shite glad sum1 said it

DC Is dying anyway, they succumbed to political agenda, SJW propaganda. They try to force people there nonsense so much that it became   untolerate able.

Sorry Pewds but im gonna have to dislike the video the cw is the best thing ever

Watch arrow felix. Don’t let super girl ruin that DC universes for you.

I think power rangers has better effects

Supergirl used to be good but now BIGGGG OOOOOOF

Shut up Ally Mcbeal

Its crazy how somebody with no talent whatsoever can build a career of talking about other people.

Is she just called all gay men disgusting?Cus if ment straight men, I wonder with whom they sleep with...Its a freeking paradox:A straight man has one-night stand with a girl which is acting like a man, which makes the straight man gay?

super girl is based on feminism not super heroes lmao

I watched the first 2 episodes and it was super cringe that I had to stop torturing myself‍️

Stupid

And why are you criticising

I&#39;m fine with you badmouthing supergirl but not flash

I watched it when I was 10 so we already know it was bad

This is the worst cgi ? Phillipines : are you challenging me ?

im sure supergirl viewership will rise like crazy after this video

season 5 was trash but you have to watch the previous seasons to me its not all about the cgi

hahahaha I like it
Wonder Woman: Subtle empowerment.Everything Else: Complete opposite.

My sister used to watch this until she realised how shit it was

What about wamuu from JoJo&#39;s bizzare adventure ? He did a lotta damage by spinning his hands.

this is season 4 how could you understand

Going soon
Season 1 was pretty good then it got bad, arrow and flash are good tho

This makes me feel weak being 5 ‘11

is it weird that i like supergirl

I love it!Writer: secretary, dictate this: (blows raspberries and makes fart sounds)Secretary: Ah, so the character says, “sorry, I have trouble making conversation with men less than 6 feet tall.”Writer: I still got it. Another gem straight from the verbal diarrhea hole.

whoever wrote wonder woman definitely wrote this 

Wtf is that promo, I&#39;ve seen supergirl it&#39;s nothing like that ffs

Fun fact: almost everyone missed the joke comment

I was bored thats why I watched it

I gotta say, I love Supergirl but it became really bad after season 3, I mean I remember finishing season 3 in two days but then season 4 and season 5 were so bad for some reason and although, the CGI should have become better year after year, I feel like it just became worse and worse

That other guy wasn’t Black, he was Martian.

Season 1 was super better than any other

Wrong it’s wholesome and precious watch your tongueClearly you haven’t seen the whole thing this video is misguided and ignorant and toxic because it’s negativeYou have taken this stuff out of context. Because they are awesome and wholesome They dropped in viewers because they changed networksWhat are you expecting 200 million dollar level cgi?They do their best with what they have

How dare you

“Hey that’s me” 

difficult to me making conversation with men under 6 feet tallme as an Asian : are you talking about me?

“They look like crystal meth”

But I still smash like
I SAD

Supergirl: worst cgi*indian sci fi shows have entered the chat

Budget cuts ‍️
I mean, we can&#39;t hate the actors tbh. They did a really great job doing their job. It&#39;s the director, the budget, the writers that I want to be pissed about.

They are really nice series but this was fun

<a href="">10:10</a> as  a native Spanish speaker that was so creepy hahaha how he sounded there. hahaha

no kyc gracias, (ilyou)
Damn it kinda reminds of the Ugandan films.

the dislikes on this vid are supergirl &quot;fans&quot; making multiple accounts

Grant with his little hand spin lol im dead XD  and just edited to say this because i watched supergirl, arrow, flash and legends but just know the cgi might be bad like arrow punching literally air and flash running looks like a 12 yr old just started using cgi and wanna make it look cool but the story is actually pretty damn good, especially arrow.

At least the ps2 looked Nostalgic

i really loved watching the flash back then but now all CW shows are cringy as fuck 

Damn 14k dislikes
Cw is baddd

<a href="">1:15</a> Nigga&#39;s like?! 
Such a waste of a property.

HOW IS THE CGI THAT SHIT !?!?! Like I know this is not a Hollywood movie but goddamn are your editors on meth or some shit !!!!!! This shit looks like that Power Rangers joint .....

Pewdiepie has more views than Supergirl

Lol supergirl is cancelled after season 6

Never mess with a construction worker, you never know.

i won’t lie, i like supergirl and i disliked the video from the start cause im a simp but watching through the whole thing i couldn’t do anything other then give a thumbs up

Superboy

Go watch the marvel shows

I refuse to believe actual real life women were on this writing team. They had to have been cultivated in a lab and spoonfed white feminism until they were ready to make a mockery of the entire gender

This is why people actually hate woman, not becasuse of just being woman, becasuse of this type of shits!

those shooters at <a href="">5:28</a> could be a worthy opponent for Stormtroopers

&quot;me gusta&quot;

Cw&#39;s Flash is good

<a href="">9:12</a> I wish at least one of the writers whould have know, what comics are:((

This would have looked like a maybe ok 90&#39;s quality editing

That leroy Jenkins clip sends a chill down my spine that I can&#39;t even explain

Let me get this straight, you think Leeroy Jenkins is still funny?I do. And I’m tired of pretending it’s not

I like it....

new profile pic pewdiepie?

That title tho- <b>is the best</b>

Lucifer is better

This I why I hate DC

Watched supergirl and didn&#39;t realise it&#39;s so bad

The graphics in the film look better in the thumbnail ️️️

I wonder what&#39;s pewds reaction if he watch the filipino tv series called &quot;Victor Magtanggol&quot;

The CGI is like that because they have very few people doing the vfx, little time and not much money

Have you guys watched batgirl? Its equally bad

pewdiepie how dare you

this is why I watch anime instead, like it looks way better than that-

Bruh this reminds me of the ugandan movies cgi

So far I&#39;ve enjoyed all the arrowverse shows i watched (arrow, flash, legends) but i just couldn&#39;t go on with supergirl. I really tried because i wanted to see more about how supergirl&#39;s universe ties in with the other shows, but the the writing was too dull.

I dont like pewdiepie
That&#39;s not what it looks like its edited

After I watched flash I was really excited for supergirl, then I watched season 1 after that I never saw supergirl again

The cgi is similar to the top stupid hero films here in the Philippines its even better hahahaha we&#39;re so behind lol

When the spoof of a series has more views than the series. F

And what’s funny about the supergirl woman justice thing is in a good majority of the comics and animations she’s considered more powerful then Superman lol

Kara zor El Danvers is supposedly the strongest one in the El family and smart too. But CW made her such a fucking idiot whose also a wimp I just can&#39;t

I think Cara Dune (Gina Carano) from the mandalorian would make a great female superhero, because you mentioned it would be cool to have a female superhero, but if she was buff like how the actor for Superman is. She looks rly buff to me at least.

I’ve never watched Supergirl but she’s not that bad in her cameos in other arrowverse shows

I agree with you pewds

Supergirl was horriblearrow n flash was okay

They made everything too gay

I mean, Supergirl has never been all that buff, just toned. Her power isn&#39;t really linked to her physical fitness all that much, or at least it&#39;s not noticeable.

Pewds: this CGI looks so bad...Filipinos: Who summoned us?

The worst cgi in tv series is victor magtangol

power rangers
I actually really liked the first two seasons of Supergirl. Then it became hella cringe

Do the flash too

Funny thing flash and legends of tomorrow are actually good

supergirl is the worst tv series I’ve ever watched

Lol

SPOILERS BTW!!!!

The 3rd clip looks like they are in a Snapchat filter

Mate i have watched every episode the cgi is not that bad and the story line is sick if you do not know what the series is dont complain about it

This came out in 2020.. feels like it came out years ago

&quot;Im not just gonna blind hate on something, im not gonna do that&quot; The whole video: is about you blind hating on supergirl.

Supergirl is Superman&#39;s Older Cousin That&#39;s prob why she&#39;s stronger<a href="">9:15</a>

It&#39;s called an Image Inducer<a href="">1:33</a>

Yea they have better cgi

I watch the arrow verse series but not supergirl

Get woke....go broke

Woke Vox contributors after watching this: <b>palms sweat</b>

Leroy Jenkins tho 

.

Like now it is cancelled, maybe they realised it that it was bad by pewdiepie

That is so fucking bad... yet kyle xy got cancelled ;)

Flash and Arrow are better tho

just watch Flash

subscribe to BLACKPINK plss
subscribe BLACKPINK plss

PewDiePie why are you watching SupergirlMe should I rather watch you play video games

Its not superwoman   its just a super girl

Can we talk about roast in here a lil. I am a supergirl fan but pewdiepie roast it so good I laughed so hard! ️This was iconic   

Thank god it got canceled what was even that line where she said:I don&#39;t make conversations with men under 6 feet so you gonna really assume people&#39;s personality with thire heights? Who in the team came up with that line needs to find another job cuz he or she gives real strong women bad look with that shit.

Supergirl season 5 was kinda trash ngl

I&#39;ve literally watched The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to finish watching Supergirl cause it was too boring and cringe.

i got T-series ad while watching this wtf is youtube&#39;s algorithm doing

Hi

People watch supergirl but do not watch jojo. 

No matter how bad supergirl is Tyler Hoechlin is 

Supergirl has gotten more disappointing over the years

Listen feminists we don’t like because it a woman we don’t like it because it sucks

I like how they say she&#39;s super man&#39;s cousin. Like honestly still doesn&#39;t change the fact that she&#39;s a copy I&#39;m not sexist but come on can they make there own characters for once

He should watch flash

I am immune to everything they can do. I&#39;m tall and will drop my pants as needed if they really wanna try and hit below the belt.
