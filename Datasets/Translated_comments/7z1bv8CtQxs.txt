I know that Bahunalli must have been two centuries and twenty-four years ago. It must have been 6Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è Ô∏è
maturity is when you realise that both amrendra bahubali and bhallaldev doesn&#39;t deserve to be king of mahishmati because -

of course bhallaldev was terrible king but at the same time 

amrendra bahubali had choosen devsena&#39;s love over people of mahishmati (who considered him to be the king) as a king sometimes you have to sacrifice your own love for the welfare of people of your kingdom. eventually devsena&#39;s love became weakness of bahubali as a result a wicked minded person(bhallaldev) became the king of mahishmati



your sacrifice for people of your kingdom makes you the great king if you chose your personal thing/person over the welfare of people of kingdom then you don&#39;t deserve to be the king

Still Gives me goosebumps everytime I come across this

Anushka is so gorgeous. Absolute beauty just like Apsara. She&#39;s is more prettier &amp; talented than bollywood so called flop actresses.

Just one word is enough. &quot;Epic&quot;

Good. Women empowerment by bahubali. <a href="">0:58</a>

Never ran out of arrows 

Netflix please add the Telugu versions of this movie please and thank you! Why is it so hard to find them! Damn! 

Sad to see om raut underused Prabhas in adipurush, where else Prabhas us a gem which should not be taken for granted

They have unlimited inventory in their arrows fr

damn cringe northies crying over physics

upload in telugu raa lanjaa
I just watched these two movies this weekend and they were so much fun!!

Anushka Ô∏èÔ∏èdiva
The Iconic scene is still fresh.

When you feel this movie you will find powerful storytelling , beautiful cinematography , heart touching music , best acting , amazing VFX than other Indian movies and some mistakes but in front of thousands good things the mistakes are meaningless .

Bahubali's father is Rocky, what is Rocky's attitude?
This is my favorite scene. Olden days indian kings and queens and war those days.

Nowadays prabas face seems different and swollen. Especially his nose and cheeks. He should get checked with a Dr.

<a href="">0:58</a>

Wonderful movie 
Eyeeeyee

And in my mouth
Where did he get that much water from?
All this is because of Baahubali
Best scene in this movie

I love you 
I love you bahubali

I disregard the physics and visual errors in the scene just for Devsena&#39;s heartstopping stare while the arrows pass kissing her eardrops  She&#39;s a perfect personification of a gorgeous warrior queen!!

00.47 
Memorable
This scene has a separate fan base!!

After Adipurush ?
&quot;This isn&#39;t a time for explanation.&quot;<b>leaves a entire palace hallway full of dead guys</b>Like... we&#39;re not going to talk about what just happened? xD

Wished Adipurush had same seemless natural scenes rather then shitty VFX ....

<a href="">0:50</a> to 0.:53 is a full paisa vasool moment...Not only Prabhas but also Anushka has acted excellently

At 1.42..the Bow  trick still is copied from The Scorpion king movie

This is crazy 
My dear heroes Prabhas and Dev Sena want to get married after seeing so much love in the film Bohobali.
I love this scene so much! I watched it over and over again! ! ! ! One like is not enough! ! ! ! I was also shot along with Devasena! ! ! ! ! ! Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali!
bahubali defying all the laws of physics 

The most ridiculous scene of this movie. ‚ÄçÔ∏è
I want to see anushka and bahu together. Thats why iam watching this movie again n again....

Nathway.

Kambu. Vanbu.

Netflix Thailand doesn't have this movie.
Capture.
This Bahubali is better than the first even though it is quite corny in many scenes. Why? Because Amarendra Bahubali fought with his woman by his side. This movie completely makes female lead, well, a lead, and not a sideshow. Both look like they are a true match. There is no power dynamic between the duo, they complete each other. Forgive me but the two shooting arrows from one bow, is just the most romantic thing ever. And not to forget that scene where she walks over his shoulders.... The romance in this one is just iconic!!!

Leave the action, just look at those pillars, windows, background, archways. Bollywood will never match this

I&#39;m here after watching Rajat Chauhan&#39;s stand-up comedy! Crowd work, where he have this Bow and Arrow!!..
This scen is same as AVe Endgame Tony and paper secan

Even after these many years the magic of the movie is still the same.

Ah yes, my wife and mine&#39;s usual date night.

she is my beauty queen and most respected charater

I didn‚Äôt know we had soo many Indians in Ghana till this movie came out .

Dv6

After watching RRR, I still feel that this movie is much better. This was Rajamouli at his peak!

its amazing how she didn&#39;t flinch

3 soldiers came running from behind so that those arrows don&#39;t go waste

<a href="">1:47</a> my favorite partttt like hellll omggg

Devasena: I was right, yeh bandaa nautanki kar raha tha abtak

Rajkumari‚Ä¶nadve Manibandham Bahir Mukham‚Ä¶ Teja‚Äù  thats line is all time favourite

I m a proud man n I love my heritage

<a href="">0:45</a> AHHHHH THE SCENE THE MUSIC THEIR CHEMISTRY

Teja <a href="">1:10</a>
Immaculate Filmmaking 
This jodi is best

<a href="">0:45</a> where the music , Devasena and the arrows hitting her Jimiki is just .... I can&#39;t express it in words .

Cut copy paste director..... Copy of Wonder woman

Taking arrows doesn‚Äôt end‚Ä¶
All bullshit..

If this hero had happened 800 years ago then no Muslim king would have done this but at that time he entertained the king in his court.
I don&#39;t know why this movie had so much exuberance. CGI looks animated. Simply terrible. I can hire a freelance designer and get that done

Physics ‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç
Anushka is looking really beautiful in this dress.

Why is Netflix India not posting the original scene in Telugu? Please respect the filmmaker &amp; post it in original language.

Teja Ramcharan? 
Best thing of South Indian moviesOne arrow can know 10 people down

Amazing scene 
<a href="">0:47</a> the tune was just mind-blowing

Their chemistry is mesmerizing.... I think I didn&#39;t feel any other actresses have this much chemistry with him....

Cheat code with unlimited arrows..lol

The only way Netflix will ever get Views..

I became Anushka s fan after watching Bahubali the conclusion. Combination of beauty with brains Anushka is.

Anushka and Prabhas please get married 

Noobde prabhas

SS Rajamouli is a genius

Fantastic attempt by Prabhas anna

Bahubali action sequences look like a bacha in front of RRR.

This is gemÔ∏è

Shield piercing arrows

Devsena :  if yk yk
Prabhas
Omg! How many arrows do they have? I could not see more than 5 arrows anytime

Dont fantasise a men will come and save you from anything....u r the only one to overcome anything in your life ...this s a fantasy and a mirage in women mind that men will protect us but in reality most of the partners never understand their wife emotions and left them sorrow full and helpless state...don&#39;t fantasis anything in movie

facke hai ye

Do they have unlimited arrows???

One of the best rajmouli illogical scenes.

The arrow which passed through the ear rings it poked my heart.

Who is here after RRR

When a backbencher turned out to be a topper!

Film that literally changed the face of Indian cinema hatsoff to rajamouli and the entire team .....
Hindi voice teesi telugu voice Petra YouTube naidu
Iconic couple Ô∏è
This scene is so stupid

He has unlimited arrows that&#39;s his super power

She slayed the role of Devsena!

bgm... and anuska looks... speech less

Epic...

too Much arrows thrown.... Still bucket auto refilled.. tech game...

bitch they are having safety but how

unlimited ammo power on
Super scane for bb2

Amazing movie - they are great on screen,  they make a far better couple off screen. 

Then Bahubali now RRR 

There is no time to tell now....don't stop telling in bad style.
Does he apply any cheat code to refill the arrows

Arrows never get over for heroes typical indian cinema
<a href="">1:49</a> pre firing 
unlimited arrow

Best 
This is sooo soo romantic

Till date, no response to this movie. Rajamouli took the bar, crushed it and made chutney out of it. The whole choreography od the scene is delightful.

I know a stupid North Indian who told RRR was taken by a man who doesn&#39;t understand or learned about gravity. I don&#39;t know what to tell them. If every movie should realistic or logically correct, then they should see award movies or stop watching Harry Potter, Pirates of carribean, Marvel movies etc. Can&#39;t you guys enjoy a movie as it is ? Why should you criticize everything ?

How are the arrows getting filled  I wonder

<a href="">0:22</a> sec, Devsena had only 4 arrows...... after complete fighting she stills has more than 4 arrows,......

Where do these so many tears come from?
The hype of Bahubali 2 and kgf chapter 2 was at unbelievable level !

The only guy with unlimited arrows

<a href="">2:01</a> galat jagape galat sawal
Arrows khatam nahi hue inke
I am am here thinking how they have so many arrows and never run out... why did they waste 2 arrows for one person in <a href="">1:24</a>???

INFINITY ARROW FIGHT 

Love this pair prabhas anushka perfect
Infinite ammo, no reload
Venustrophobia

V say ye teer lagne ke sath Banda urh kese jata hain 

Allowes fevorite

One of My most favorite scene in bahubali

What is the cost of filling the water and not refilling it?
<a href="">1:42</a> one of the funniest fight ever 

Nannu bhaadhyudanu cheyakandi/

The movie is so fake
10 times better movie than marvel&#39;s

I like Devsena&#39;s tight up bun hairstyle the most ,.........

Bahubali before beginning is coming soon

<a href="">0:28</a> From here to<a href="">0:47</a> did you see that expression, THAT&#39;S F*ING ACTING, her feeling of surprise changed to amazement JUST LOOK AT HER GAWDDD

Itnae teer mare par mazal hai teer khatam ho jayae

2 Golds archery.....Pakki baat....in next Paris Olympics 
I didn&#39;t knew they both were using cheat code to get unlimited supplies of arrows.

Make no mistake : she is not a normal babe !! Give her a pole as a prop ? She will place her left palm on it fiercely, rise above the ground , and roll around the poll thereby kicking all the useless downtrodden heads that are surrounding the pole to enjoy!! Thank you !! She is team God!! The God exists !!

That&#39;s how you should flirt. 

Hawkeye : may I come in?

Quiver has infinite arrows I see.

Overscaving this Bahubali

Greatest love story

Can someone please share the music of the video

That&#39;s the quickest KT given in a production environment 

Good evening, could you include more films by actor Prabhas and if possible dubbed... Thank you
Fun fact:    Bahubali: The Conclusion had clashed with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 on box office and GOTG flopped miserably in India which is rare for a marvel movie.

WONDERFUL

america :- we have deadpoolbahubali :- hold my archery

one of the most beautiful scenes ever in a movie...

Devi Padmavathi(Goddess of snakes)  is my father. Yes it is true. I have born by her blessing.  For example I am like Karna ( in the &quot;Mahabhartha&quot;) who was born by the blessing of Lord Surya. If you want any proof please come at Guma Manasa Bare ( very famous temple of my father) in West Bengal and ask here. Here my father comes every Sunday. I not only want that people knows my truth but also I want that everybody knows my father&#39;s power and nobility. Belief or unbelief is your matter. Don&#39;t write nor think any hate speech about my father and serve her. My father blesses you. Thank you very much..

Hope Ponniyin selvan will rock !

Nice

This scene literally shows &quot; udta teer lena&quot;.Whenever arrow were aimless, soldiers appeared out of nowhere to die....

42oss

In reality there is no fact in throwing 3 arrows with the same bow.

A movie which created a history.. A movie which depicts indian culture.. A movie which proves southindian industry is far better than bollywood craps

Lucky they got unlimited arrows.

I am counting how many arrows are  remaining with anushka.its  shocked me

There was corona during days of BahubaliLook at the enemies

<a href="">0:50</a> AnushkaÔ∏è
Hey wasn&#39;t this film streaming on Disney+Hotstar, now netflix ia showing it on their channel..

KGF or RRR can&#39;t come near the hype Bahubali series of films had. Everyone was talking about Bahubali 2 when it came out. That&#39;s the side effect of Good writing plus a grand budget.

World&#39;s shortest KT 
prabhas
And here i am wondering <b><i>is their arrows infinite</i></b>

Uk i stay near anushka s homein indiranagar

This time:Netflix getting views without effort on YouTube...

Cheers for those unlimited arrows

Her expressions showed what it is to fall in love amidst attack/war ( this wasn&#39;t actual war tho) 

this is what she expects when someone says couple goals

The mother of physics and logic
The Name is &#39;S. S. Rajamouli&#39;Waiting for R.R.R

My favourite scene of Bahubali 2 undoubtedly !!!!!!

This seen has seprate fanbase

bows never get over! It&#39;s magic magic. &lt;3

One of the best and effortless chemistry 

Just watched it yesterday night

IconicÔ∏è
Unlimited arrow cheat mode on 

Finally Netflix Realised Importance of Baahubali 

As cinematic as this is, it still gives me GOOSEBUMPS!

I just wonder why this guy is not ending the argument.
it would be better if it was in its original language!

Shortest KT ever given..that too in production environment..

Always be hot

Unlimited arrows backNever get finished 
<a href="">0:39</a> this happen in games. Arrows come out of nowhere

Netflix you are very late

This is my most favorite scene in bahubali movies

Everybody was talking about this, and then KGF arrived.

There 2 side.....One Bahubali. Indian culture , and ancient India..And another Housefull 4..Unnecessary foolish jokes.

He is just like me :-D

Dislikers are coolie no. 1 lovers

Netflix: no content lol
Damn, we rarely see such good Vfx in Indian movies.

In the name of showing action, the mother of physics is acting like a sister...
This scene was so smooth

Ô∏èno one can beat the record of Bahubali 2

Violentness is needed on both sides.
Long live Baahubali!

Bhai itne saard arrows..
One of the iconic scenes of the best south indian film

Most trolled meme of this movie that arrow scene 

If her looks can&#39;t lighten up your mood then  bro I don&#39;t think you should live on this planet 

I think netflix didnt have nay ideas for next videos i think

couple goals
Devsena Ô∏èÔ∏è
Waiting for salar 

This the scene where *Bahubali*(Amrendra) Lost his Empire

One of my favourite movie scenes ever

South Indian movies FAN Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
Anushka is dead gorgeous 
<a href="">0:20</a> how can so many people die with only 3 arrows....3-4 people just lie downed 

Coming kgf chapter 2.
Me watching Bahubhali and Devasena for the first time :  omgomgomgomgomg they are so cute together. Me watching Bahubhali and Devasena for 10000th time : omgomgomgomgomg they are so cute together 

netflix just made my day 

Cartoon

One movie which shook the whole nation, Bahubali 

ANUSHKA shetty Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
Web series kaha hai bahubali before the biggning

Reminds of the scene where Shin Chan&#39;s aunt visited his school and competed with the school photographer in different and Unique pose

Best scene

Netflix just showing off the rights they have owned over this movie...

Yo why did you remove that video

Hey Netflix india we want pokemon movie I choose you in hindi dub

This scene made me feel like, I need to watch this film again right now Ô∏è

Mile gya @Netflix ka free Subscription

Why in Hindi?!The original Movie is In TeluguUpload in Original Language not dubbed One

<a href="">0:25</a> No Bollywood Hero Can fit for that scene

When you realise Netflix didn&#39;t want to use the real voice of these excellent actors  bravo boi bravo 

This film was okay.First half was cliche like Housefull 4It didn&#39;t much focused on his son.Only first part had GREAT VISUALS.It was Cartoonish in this one.

Hit a like  for Darling prabhas..

After Avengers Endgame this was the only film for which I was so hyped!!

Mobile legend miya

Why do these soldiers even bother wearing armour, if it doesn&#39;t offer any protection.

Still now also for me stunning lighting,gousup

Arrow marte ja rhe par khatam ek bhi nhi ho rhe See the big mistake

@netflix please take Telugu version

<a href="">0:36</a> = Devsena has 3 arrows<a href="">0:52</a> = magic happens and now she has atleast 5 arrows with her.

Ram and Seetha Netflix ,why don&#39;t you plan this grandeur ?

Devsena: Wait, what is the cheat code of infinite ammo? Baahubali: Now there is no time to tell this, Rajkumari, come.
<a href="">1:40</a> 0.25x me dekho
This is the unique movie in film industry 

Where is the trailer of Godzilla Singular Point Netflix 
Netflix is going to buy Bahubali 

Love you Prabhas
Just came here for Prabhas

Ye itne pose mar mar ke kyu arow shoot kar rhe hai 

Just remembering the hype this movie had 4yrs before. Whole country was literally shaken.

Best Film I have ever seen. I want Bahubali part 3

People in movie clips: No science,no physics..When they are asked physics questions : Katappa...Hadh hein yaar

I am a 15 y/o 10th grader who is fond of writing songs..just uploaded my first original and would love to hear about it from the person seeing this comment..

What was the meaning of posting this scene...saala you search on thub and you will get many full pictures for free ‚ÄçÔ∏è
I know not to mind the physics and all, but ek bhi soldier ne shield upar nahi ki

Nobody:My earphones inside pocket: <a href="">1:45</a>

I loved this scene

Never ending arrows from the basket 

Love this movie but sad it ended if possible please make part 3

everything looks epic until the cgi arrows come in

orCGT
Something Very Very iconic.

this is the stupidest scene after that barrel throw scene in bahubali 2

<a href="">0:27</a> far cry 4 copy

Seems more like entry of Ginyu Force  from dragon ball Z 

Guys relax !! Physics &amp; logic don&#39;t exist anymore.

I still keep watching these two movies bahubali 1 and 2 all Sunday s with my family .trough USB ,offing the lights..

Teer hn k k tum e ni hoty
This was just the trailer. Prabhas gonna do this on a much larger scale in Adipurush. Om Raut has asked Prabhas to get an archer&#39;s body.

How are you making money by uploading videos?
didn&#39;t posted original telugu audio , it is an insult for telugu language 

Thank youÔ∏è
It is insulting that a telugu original was dubbed version was posted instead of original soundtrack

South Industry ko India ke top pr lane walk Movie
Bahubali now
I started watching the full movie again
This scene has separate fan base

When we see a dog barkingüá∫üá∏ He might be hungry üáÆüá≥ Usko bhoot dik raha hoga

Baahubali 2 was a total hit blockbuster

OP

Devasena: havent prepared for the test but knows even bestie didnt. Settles with passing score.Bahubali (bestie): back stabs and attempts all questions. Scores exceptionally well.

wow

Evergreen cinema  Prabhas and Anushka ....Prabhas will look similar in Adipurush Ô∏è.... eagerly waiting to see pubsu on big screen

<b>Unlimited Ammo cheat activated</b>
Good morning Netflix India, I'm a fan of SRK, I really like his films, I would like to watch his films from 2020 and 2021, thank you.
Americans : we have AvangersLe indians: we have Bahubali series and KGF series 

Physics ki baat mat karo yrr Hollywood ke Marvel and DC ke superhero movies mai kaha physics hota hai....btw I&#39;m a Marvel fan

I don&#39;t know  why people want to find physics and reality...... in mass moviesBro,it&#39;s mass movie

Don&#39;t look at the logic... Just enjoyyy

Just like this two .. we want a episode in Cobra Kai when both Sam and Megel .. Fight Together side by side and show the world that they unbeatable together and show Cobra kai Goons that their Love Conquers All...

This was a very nice scene, a heart warming scene.
Like Bahubali I have Friend , Who Pretended that he is very poor in studies,But as soon as the result came , My reaction was same like devsena..

Wow ..they are performing like power rangers 

Who is watching?
Lovely 
the pride of Indian Cinema

Salmon Bhoi: My crew is this weak character.
Hollywood : infinity warLe south Indians: Infinity arrows

Their must be a expectation vs reality version of this scene.
