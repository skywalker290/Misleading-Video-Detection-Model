Brother log!!! This is a fantasy, in fact, by breaking up like this, any number of fake charges can be imposed on you.. This is not the woman of our mothers' time but the queen of today, please handle it maturely.
Girls and boys..This topic will never ended..Kitane bhi comments karlo,,kitne bhi movie,, video banalo,, chatting karlo, debate karlo..Jo he wo he,,aur reality,, ladko aur ladkiyo ko bhi pata he..Par accept karne ki,, statement karne ki himmat sab me nahi hoti..Real man- pure girl ,, still a Mistery..

Single...
1 minute silence for the simps, who get serious with the girls with male best friends.

Good old days when Kartik Aryan used be a good actor

I f u

That&#39;s y I don&#39;t trust anyone.

Chutiya love...
I think there is a need for a best friend, life is a relationship, there should be a good friend too, boy/girl, you should have a best friend but you should be loyal to your partner, you should be loyal to the best friend too. What happens if you are not loyal to your best friend?
Usne galat kya kis tha??

Powerful scene and the love story is beautiful 

I&#39;m so fortunate. My wife never had a best friend.

Bada chutiya word h I love you
Bharucha perfectly fits in role of a bitch, a bitch who has ruined my school years.

When boys decides to play....

The story is not over yet, after that the girl filed a case of harassment and molestation against the boy, accusing him of raping her while in a live-in relationship and reneging on the marriage. Then the girl lives a happy life with Sunny and Section 376 is imposed on the boy and He goes to jail
Wish he says all three at last &quot;Bitch&quot;   &quot;Bitch&quot; &quot;Bitch&quot;

Should have kissed all three !

It is the blessing of Kalyug, it will shower upon me today, and tomorrow it will shower upon me!
I don't know why I am with him..? I just dont know..I love this movie.. Break-ups should happen in such toxic relationships..️️ 
Kyoki sach me kartik ka charactor acha hai.. vo iske sath relastion me hai to sache dil se isika hokar rehta hai.. one wooman man.. ️️I love his charactor.. in this both movies 1,2. These three mens charactors are honest, genuine in this movie.. they are genuine..so good..️️

Kyoki sach me kartik ka charactor acha hai.. vo iske sath relastion me hai to sache dil se isika hokar rehta hai.. one wooman man.. ️️I love his charactor.. in this both movies 1,2. These three mens charactors are..true.. so good..️️

Sometimes we just tired of forgiving them and crushed our self respect for them this is worst feeling when you beg to someone to stay with you and at that your self respect just ended i felt this pain they just used as a object  this is not about gender it is all about person character 

Cheap and false words…..
I love this Movie 
Thanks for showing the truth of girls. Punchnama of love. Girls have taught us why not to love them. BC MC is our only right on our money, not you bitches.

Guys can be toxic too, it&#39;s not always women.

Yeh sahi hai. . .  Kuch bhi karlo.  phir last mein.  &quot;Sorry.  jaane do na. . .  I LOVE YOU&quot; waala card khel do and expect everything to be okay. . . Kabhi kabhi sochta hun.  agar yeh invasion of privacy reverse hota toh kaisa hota . . . When people can judge you and not only form opinions but spread those opinions about you to all your College mates.  tuition mates.  school mates.  office mates.  flat mates.  gym.  internship. NGO and so on. . .  You name it and the place or the person is infiltrated and turned against you .  doing their bidding and passing on your information to them. . .  What would have happened if the situation were to reverse. . .  Which ugly truths and details were to spill. . . Guess .  I don&#39;t the have to reverse the situation to find out. . . You have hinted and said a lot already. . . I wish no one in the world gets false-friends like you people who drive one to his/her suicide. . .  Plant false friend around them.  make them feel lonely.  useless and incompetent.  make them go into depression .  turn their college life into darkest period of their lives.  try to botch up their careers.  leave them scars that refuses to heal and opens up every now and then oozing bad memories and nightmares. . .  And surprisingly there are people helping her in this. . .  I mean how screwed the world can be to be hearing one side of story and believing it and helping them to extract revenge. . .  And REVENGE for what exactly?Did I ever go back on my words. . .  Was I the One who cheated with your best friend. . .  Was I the One who had long calls with your best friend. . .  Was I the One who went in relationship with you on advice of your best friend. . .  Was I the One who said sorry to you before we kissed. . .  Was I the One who cried afterwards with guilt weighing in my heart knowing fully well that I shouldn&#39;t have just kissed someone just to settle scores with your best friend. . .  Did your best friend ask you about for how much we snogged. . .  Or was I the One who goes about clicking pics with your best friend years after passing out and spending times together getting cosy over milk shakes and lattes. . .  Yes I lied and I accept it. . .  Call it my childishness or plain stupidity. . .  I lied because somewhere deep down there I felt in no perfect world would someone like you be ever interested to go out with me and beneath that all tough confident charm I was pulling in my high school years.  I felt maybe I am not good enough for you. . .  I found myself falling for you even before I could help myself or before I knew who you were. . .  I remember that embarrassing time when we were returning from Maths tuition .  Omkara classes.  Arunodaya market and you said you had to take a turn as your house was near and I without thinking made a quick exit into an alley so as to look cool and not be perturbed with you wishing to part ways. . .  But embarrassingly found myself in a completely strange and unknown alley of which I had no idea. . .  That&#39;s the level of childishness and stupidity I was operating on. . . Nevertheless with all the things said and done.  even if I lied .  today with grace of God.  I have the capacity to turn each one of my lies into truth. . .  I can always work harder to be more successful.  richer and famous than before. . .  And I will be inshaAllah .  all in my own good time .  not to win or impress you. . .  But the scars that you gave me.  the years of pain.  humiliation.  torture and games you played. . .  No one can undo them or erase those dark memories from my life. . .  You can never fix those traumas that pushed me to the point of suicide or ease the feeling I felt when I was experiencing them or going through them. . .  Even thinking about those dark college days brings tears in my eyes. . .  There&#39;s not a single shred of happy thought that I borrow from that hell-hole. . .  But you had a blast there at my expense .  didn&#39;t you? Well done KM .  Really well done.  But you know what hurt me the most. . .  That all this time.  you didn&#39;t even think me as a human being enough to stop the incessant torture and humiliation. . .  Even people don&#39;t do this to their worst enemies .  what you did to me. . .  Anyways I was kind of saving the above confession for your birthday next month but don&#39;t think it matters now. . .  Nobody in their right mind would ever think that this could ever work and with present Govt and Media machinery in place which makes all Muslims look bad.  this is not only impossible but for something like this to happen.  even the slightest possibility doesn&#39;t exist. . .  I think I am just being delusional and for all I know you never cared for these wishes or random you-tube comments. . .  Heck! I don&#39;t even know if these make it up to you and you ever read them. . . There you go another stupid act I have dragged on for years now. . .  Maybe its finally time to close this chapter once and for all times to come. . . Agar mujhse koi galti anjaane mey(kyunki jaane buch kar maine aaj tak tumhe hurt karne ki koshish ya saazish nahi ki) ho gayi ho .  jisse aapko takleef pahuncha ho .  please maaf kardena. . . I AM SORRY.  Wishing you all the best.

A committed girl's single female friends are her worst enemies! ~ Chanakya (probably) 
It&#39;s happens in  real life

This is amazing my friend.....
The best part is when he said ILY to her friends too, it was just so casual

Girls apne friends se discuss kre vo friendship boys kre to tum sabko dhindhora peet dete ho relationship kaEsa kyu?

I love you

Break up  ho toh Aisa

I&#39;m also a girl.. but  I don&#39;t have this kind of friends. Actually eysi ladkiyon k wajah se hi sari ladkiya badnaam hai..

Millions bitterness for 1 bitch

We just want part 3 ASAP

The last scene was the best

Nice, so funny
<b>**************************************************************************************************************</b>

Kartik Aryan be like ... Itna sab kch sehne ke baad ek kiss to le krr hee jaunga... &quot;Men will be men&quot; 

So handsome akshay sir

What a thing
Saste or jhoote teen sabd 
That&#39;s called breaking up like a boss

Women don&#39;t love you for who you are, they love you for what you can do for them!  - An advice for my brothers 

I made you sad yarr
Hey, 
It's true that when we love every boy, we know that we look at the wrong person or they do complete worship on our girl, but we don't know how to love, its very bad &amp; sad love life
This movie these scenes just different level

Ye scene ko flower samjhe the fir hai mai

Reality

reality of girls nowadays

This was the killing scene ever

Fav dialogue ️
amazing movie

Surely it&#39;s based on true story 

He really nailed dis scene

It's cheap and cheap 3 words...
This scene makes me determined  not to call my fucking ass bitch.

I can't break it up!
Girls are like this, what to do
Aaahhh Kartik nailed it....love it love it

wow

Nice

I LOVE YOU.
Thank god I saw this scene before telling my crush 
Idk why but I feel Chauka and Tarun had better climax with their girls

You see the last music is mujhe Teri zarurat hai

... I love you
Jo cheat krti hain unn randeeyon ke bare m ye comment nhi h but jo normal one guy at a time wali ldki h, unke liye ye comment h !!! &quot;Bestfrnd hone m koi burayi nhi h but there must be a fine decent line between a bestfriend and a boyfriend !!! Agr bestfrnd ke sath bhi whi sb kr rhi ho jo boyfrnd ke sath kiya jata h, emotional attachment etc tb kya frk h dono m ??? Bestfriend ke ander bhi faltu m feelings jga rhi ho aur boyfrnd ko bhi bura lgta h !! Ab ya toh frnd ka dil tutega ya toh boyfrnd ka... Tmhara kya h, tmhare pas toh hmesa ek extra choice hoti h, you just have to choose !!

Ldkiyan Boyfrnd ke samne bestfrnd ke gaand se aise chipkengi jaise janm janm ke bichhde ho, laudi kisi ek naaw m safar kr, ya toh bestfrnd ke gand m hi ghus, ya boyfrnd ke... Sala jb Boyfrnd se ldayi hota h toh kud ke best frnd ke pas chal.jaygi, aur jb Boyfrnd sorry bolega tb bestfrnd ko chhor degi...  Itna agr boyfrnd kre apni female frnd ke sath tb toh gand jal jayga aur brk up ki dhamkee degi ki usse bat kiya toh mai ja rhi  khud itni narrow minded hoti h aur dusro ko broad minded hone ki salah deti h...

My Favorite Sense 
Yes girls, you will keep yourself and avoid many male friends or boy friends.

This scene ️

bestfriend if ho toh us ladki I mean chutiya chodu ladki se dur raho

Dec 2019 when I broke up after seeing my girlfriend cheating on me for years, again and again and taking me for granted.Till date it just ruins my day when I even see a movie clip of someone cheating. I don&#39;t know how these people who cheat live with themselves.

kartik aryanis best actor
Back Ground Music Name plz

The cringe in this scene is a little different.
everythiing aside that breakup kiss ,,, hits different

Those three breakups were the most satisfying scenes of the movie 

You love your mother more after watching this movie, man! love is what you do
Arey @ocean sir kAmal in pubg casting mein yaha bhi kamal
Among those three, this was the best way to breakup. Loved it

tharak nahi chode but end me

U nailed it kartick..

I went with my friends to watch this movie. Before movie - yrr kab tak tak rahenge..ek gf dila deAfter movie - bhad me jaye love..chahiye hi nhi gf 
I am still waiting for that famous human being who will come here just to comment how &quot;misogynistic&quot; this entire film is and that we must file a petition in court to ban it. Where are you girl?

Today&#39;s generation don&#39;t know the real meaning and feeling of love,it&#39;s just become a time pass, game and status for some people,,,love based on understanding,trust ,and believe,,,when you break this ,,no meaning of realationship,,,when you love from your heart,you have no confusion,,,but girls confused about it,,, firstly identify/clarify ,who your friend and who&#39;s your BF, otherwise due to one&#39;s love so many people specially,male suffering from this situation,they lost their time, energy,money  on this ,so don&#39;t do this time pass and vulgarity in the name of love &amp; defame ,,love,. Love is pure and immortal!!

Best part of this movie

Parents love ️ is heaven on Earth 

most of them stay in your friend's or roommate's house...
Their attraction qualities are different ony same skin colour

One minute, she was upset and was discussing something with her friends, was she wrong there? Is it not normal to go on to ask your friends should I break up with him or not? I mean, I don&#39;t get this whole thing completely.Though, I do not support getting extra close with your guy friend especially when you are in a relationship.

Corona to India: I love you

Ye to me bhi manti hu cheap words 

It seems that the director of Pyaar Ka Punchnama movie has tortured some girl!!!!
Same situation with me. My ex also looks like Nushrat Bharucha. Such a relatable scene.

I Love you is the most misused word 

One of the best sense

How true is this scene 
No one but Karthik

This is not a movie, it is the truth of today.
I tried same with my ex , but my bluetooth didn&#39;t connect , than they said they can&#39;t hear it , and blamed me for recording , and she broke up.. 

I love you

I wish I could post that GIF..&quot;Maa chod diye bhaiya jii aap toh&quot;

Just wanted to see what would have happened if the speaker didn&#39;t work

Faaadd dii brother...
what a hottie you are
L***e lag gaye background me chal reha tha didi k..
It is hard to believe in girl in term of love becoz they have turned chief to the libes &quot;I L U&quot;...

As a girl who just have boy best friends...idk about other but for me all of them are like brothers....and whenever is see a girl too much like too much clinging on guy like how nushrats character did idk but ok <b>laying headin her lap ok a lot of us do</b> <b>making food yeah!!</b> But bro u would never ever sleep with him if I have a boyfriend honestly I was so glad that kartik trusted her even though he had a feeling still he trusted his girl....he deserves better and thank God!! Broke up......as a person whose my St of the friends are guys while watching the movie I definitely too felt chiku was cheating .....*while picking a stone she lost a diamond* damn!! Me and my boy best friend are like Tom and Jerry but they treat me like sisters ........I would never let go of such a man who trust me and take care of me like how anshu did......

Your friend circle gives your character and your choice description.

Hahaha

Love really is such a delicious thing.
I watch this movie before I get into rltnsip so that  I can be in my senses 



At last my sister did not understand what was happening with me.
I don&#39;t like romantic movies... But PKP franchise is close to my heart

Bhai phone to lae jata firse wahi chord gya घाया ।
I love u...I love u....

Never trust a girl 

Sexy boi kartik. Looking stunning in this scene

to CITY
Really yr guys today I LOVE YOU is just a word ....

Hahaha 
Chal joti was my favorite scene

Yeh sab toh thik hai... Par last me kiss karne ka matlab kya hua

love is like mutual fund comes with risk

Bakcho..............   d

I am crazy about any girl's issue.

Therefore , FRIENDS and your  CIRCLE does matter

What&#39;s wrong with the translator here 


Mey v aise h ...kiss kar ke choda ta ...last day

First few minutes were quite silly haha &#39;I love you~&#39;Edit: oooh I definitely didn&#39;t see <a href="">1:46</a> coming

Bakvas

Aaquib sir we love you....️
It's a strange scene.
This is wt most of girls do now a days...They don&#39;t understand their boyfriend. Best friend itna he aacha hai to raho uske sath he...They are already feeling less and they make good guyz bad....

Best movies ever
Gaand hi maar li londe ne
Honestly if you go by “feminism”...then he should’ve slapped the shit of these girls for being cheaters‍️ girls do that these days right?!!

Personally, in my point of view last kiss was most loving part of this video

Beleive in Allah nd the last messenger Sallahu allayi wasallam . Read quran and offer namaz

I love you

It was my favorite scene nd we shouldn&#39;t believe on girls.

True

Understanding this, life is in love.
My fav scene in this movie 

I love you I love you I love you

Once a legend said&quot;when you can&#39;t change the girl just chenge the girl&quot;

Favourite scene
This movie is a classic cult, realistic movie based on millions of true incidents always happen in everyday of Boy&#39;s life....this movie will never become old even in 3000 A.D..

I love you l love you 
That circle scene is so cringy

Who is those shit, who unlike this scene

He had us in the first half not gonna lie

Movie ki ending achi nhi hai all 3 girls should get worst husbands  than this guys

Kartik Aaryan is brilliant ️️️
Hahaha remembering  of my Ex gf she did the same with me and I just maked her sure that my love was true and she was fake so now she is overreacting with me and she is saying that  he was a friend  of me but actually she is still trying to cheat on me a girl and a boy  can not be close friends Stay single stay happy 

You are my favorite actor

Juta soaked in cow dung is eaten...
Bhaiyon...our youths...i want to say all of you youg generation regardless sex(m,f) if you really understand the mean of love than we all should firstly our family....means parents and others sibling...then career and than country and society....Sirf ek ladaka ya ek ladaki k chakar mai is human life ko kabada mat banoa yaar....Human life and there existence demand some more contribution rather than like a animal ()...Saala career par dhyan doge toa jisase bhi shadi hogi career achha rahega toa wo automatically tumase love karane lagega/i....Aaj k life mai bhi toa yahi ho raha h jawani k maze kisi se le lo lekin shadi k wqt well settled person chahiye.....Isi mansikta ne bhartiye samaj ko dushit aur pradushit kar rakha h janha aaj baap- beti...aur na jane kitane tarah k gandh ho rahe h society.... kindly humble request to all india youth generation...sirf physical requirements k naam par achhi bharatiye sanskriti ko barbad hone se bacha lo.....

These kids need help...<a href="">1:17</a>Please donate...

Same thing happens in real life too, we just don't understand and if we ever tell the truth then we will get blindsided.
Ouch that hurts

Reality of girls

Bt bt bt,Boys still running behind girls like chutiya.
Choka 4...

Gad hi maar diya
They say how far away can a lark go, if a lark loves them then they can make friends with them or I think about the relationship between the lark and share it with others, they understand what it means to give. How can you be a good friend when you treat a girl like someone or a friend of the opposite gender? tu lover khak honge so, jo janu hy woi dost hai nai tu dekh lo phr movie mn kia howa
Favourite scene
Best break up ever

People with brain and who knows the value of friendship would have asked the person in a relationship to talk to his/her partner and sort it out. If it isn&#39;t still resolved  then do whatever you think is right &amp; not what your friends think.

if you have a best friend who is male and you also has boyfriend is don&#39;t wrong but when you get too close with best friend is wrong please don&#39;t do that to anyone

Maan gye bro ....break up time par bhi ...kiss ...
Epic scene

I watched this movie at the theatres with my then girlfriend  and one of her female friend , after the movie they were like we&#39;re not like this, this is too much and shit. And now she is with her friend&#39;s  boyfriend.Moral : sab Ladkiyan chutiya nahi hoti par koi ladki apki chutiya khaat sakhti hai

Rs 50 for overacting
This is my favourite scene

I love Tina..

Happened with me but I was at place of kartik

Love can make anyone crazy
I am a girl. But I like this movie, boys should be a little hard, some girls should not be like this, but whatever is happening, boys should do it like this, they should live in attitude, they are being proud of themselves and their self respect should also be there, boy. Who wants to read this movie?
Bc kya bkchodi h ye
Seriousness aside I want that phone which can record that high quality voice.

Hahahahahahaha

Nice

Niyat se hi kamini thi by thakur

I love you

Read the kiss before breakup...how will anyone find out?
Sec 498A the new weapon of Sophisticated Women. Who are marrying and using this to extort money.

Smash it

Brother's style of doing breakup is to kiss with love...after that come back.
At <a href="">2:45</a> she looks like Tushar Kapoor :D oh man.. :D

My favorite scene is itne chutiye shabd hai koi bhi ki kuch bhi koi se bo deta hai
At last, brokeup tha toh kiss q kiya
I love you 

Taste came again
Aisa kya galat  tha recording mai... It&#39;s normal. Maine aj tk kbhi bhi apni best frnd k bf ki tarif nhi ki. Hm hmesha ldte h but my besty handles it very well.



i love you iloveyou play
I LOVE YOU

I love you i love some one so much 

Mai toh thapad zaroor marta

Its real natural and everone should be ready for this also if he she is in a relationship

Best way to breakup. Anyways the girl was definitely wrong.

Love can defame no one in the world through its app,,,, but what I say to you Love is never the truth, what a cheap word it is.
Girls need respect, they need love, they need trust, they need care, they need freedom, or boys need only the company of girls in life.
Guys want hot chicks, good looking face  &amp; then they blame all girls. Boyz blame urself that u r the ones who r running behind Only Looks  then u should NOT expect all good characteristics.

The ass is not a bastard's ass 
More than this, his friend is a bastard. Such friends are very mean fuckers.
girls ki girl friend hi sali haramu hotihai
This was my favorite scene 

It is true that this friend is very difficult for me whether I am a girl or a boy friend.
Best scene of the movie

Rumours is that they are still dancing in a circle cheering i love you

In bhend sacne  he say s I hate you

The best scene 
Agar yhe tumhari chut jaisi shakl se pyar nehi hua hota na to batate Kitna Bura Lagta h hme

Isko bolte hain baithake chodna
Best scene

I want to see the movie.....

I am a girl and I too believe that being over closed with a friend by giving a name of best friend is completely wrong

Perfect movie, truth of today&#39;s society

There should be no need of male best friend, if you have hubby or bf, you should make your hubby a best friend, Kabir Singh is latest example, why to involve third person if you truly love each other

Everything that is shown in this movie is truth of today&#39;s society

<a href="">3:10</a> yup bro

Full movie link please

# Best idea osm

Hahaha.....madao ka pole kohl ke diya diya hai movie ne
Kat Gaya 
Karishma is more beautiful than nushrat

Have you ever seen Sunny in this movie?
Always looks better than the lead heroine…his friend is right.
Koi full movie ka link do



Ye totally scene mere sath hua h..but in reverse...I&#39;m a girl nd my bf do ..ditto like this butvh girl with me for d sake of his friends...I still love him and missing him so much yar

Lover friends are dangerous guys be careful

After watching this movie, I felt love...
Awesome...acting by kartick

What a powerful scene, this.Finally, a love story from a man&#39;s perspective.In a world filled with movies that criminalize the male gender, this movie is a stark opposite one. Yet, a harsh truth, a truth that none likes to accept.Women too do shit.

Personally.. This was my favourite scene ever..!!



I love you 2
