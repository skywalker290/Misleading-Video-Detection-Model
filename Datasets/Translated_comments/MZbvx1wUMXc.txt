Jai Jaganath🙏 🙏

To beat Australia in semifinals/final   strategy should be only attack.

Australian😆🤏
Jason Ray is a bad player who doesn't know why the team doesn't keep him in the team.
<a href="">4:35</a> Wicket miss of Roy in 2019 is same ball as wicket of SuryaKumarYadav(SKY) in 2023

<a href="">5:32</a> min Australia be like lets do it in next world Cup in India

Chris Woakes career best achievement is the Player of the match vs Aus in WC semis🥶

Hence proved,if you want win world Cup you want to defeat australia in knockout games😢😢😢

<a href="">4:02</a> to <a href="">4:09</a>, michael slater commentary, what did he said!!😮

You have to create pressure on us, that's how we will play in the final or semi-final, only then can you win the match from us.
Only England and West Indies has the capacity to smash Australia

Australia won 2023 world cup

This match is a prime example of needing more reviews. Roy&#39;s decision was very poor. I&#39;ve always thought Kumar just guesses

You are already winner if you beat australia in knockouts

2027 WC india will take revenge from Australia

England deserved to win the WC2019

Who is watching this semi final in 2024

Who is after Australia vs India 2023 final

Some shitty Indians will come here and comment that how happy are they to see Australia lost that Semi Final match against England. This shows that how much mean mentality Indians have and we just think to win the World Cup trophy 😂😂😂😂😂. This is extremely hilarious 🤣😂. Indians are always Indians with mean mentality and that’s why they lost both world cups in 2019 and 2023. 😂😂😂😂

England left Jason Roy in WC 2023 and they bite the dust😮

Really missed jason roy in this world cup.I am missing that demolishing England team as well.Come on England. Win both the wt20 2024 and champions trophy as well.

i am read in class7. In my group study my freind Saiful his roll no:224 Amd my rool is 222😂😂😂😂😂

Feeling proud after watching this match
I wish if India defeated AUS like this😢

Verry good to seen sad faces australians

England 💥💥
I felt like watching Australia's heart...
Watching Australia&#39;s defeat is another level of satisfaction. They should be f*cked in every single WC from 2027.

Since Australia defeated India in CWC 2023, I have not been able to bear it, that is why I have been watching the highlights of the semi-finals, what a master England has played to India.
Attacking cricket by England vs very defensive by india..............

<a href="">5:31</a> hardik pandya did the same and people started trolling him

Morgon rock😘😘

Dang warner just need 2 more runs to get most runs the pain bro

Gg

Why these Team have rivalry?

It was special perfomance from England. Their classy bazball at its best. If theirs someone England missed the most this wc it is Jofra Archer and Jason Roy. Never saw such a dominating perfomance against Australia in a semi final.. Jason Roy&#39;s blitzkrieg ended any little ray of hope left for Australia.

Everyone thought that Australia England would be a very interesting match and it will go down to the last over but it turned out that the semi final 1 which was played by India against New Zealand turned out to be one of the most Epic matches of World Cup history rather than the Aus vs Eng one...and everyone predicted Ind vs Eng and Ind vs Aus game as finals and there came Kiwis to shock all the people

Jason Roy is such a stylish batter when he gets going just don&#39;t know why he wasn&#39;t included in eng side for 2023 WC atleast when topley got injured they should have included Roy and bairstow was utter flop show didn&#39;t score in a single game in 9 matches he played pothetic

Smith deserved hundred here as well...2 hundreds in 2 back to back semis what an unbelievable record that wouldve been

<a href="">0:50</a> what a stylish short man 🥳

When Aus goes down smith ready to fight for Aus in knockout game&#39;s

Who is during CWC23

Aus took revenge this time

Here after AUS knocked out England.

Here after AUSTRALIA knocked ENGLAND OUT of the 2023 Cricket World Cup

Pity we may not see Archer in this 2023 ODI WC here in India.

Smith&#39;s 85🐐

Smith always stands for aus in tough situation

And now they have just dropped jason roy from world cup squad...

T

Who ever wins semifinal against Australia will win World Cup 2011 India 2019 england

Smith always performs on big stages . he gave his best where no other batsman could not score

joe root is truly a gem in world cup. in 2016 t20 world cup he was tin top 3 in terms of runs and in 2019 he was in top 5.

<a href="">4:40</a> this the pressure 🥵

Please increase Prize money of Cricket WC as Football WC

Super🔥
Chris Woakes and the Dukes ball. Name a better duo

I am trying to be a faithful buddhist.

Morgan &amp; Root didn&#39;t bother about missing 50 they were happy for reaching the World Cup Final this shows their dedication towards their Country first 🙌

Stoinis worst player ever in Australia.....

FORTHEMOMENTSTHATMATTER

England players are very good at Direct hits

BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD

asalamoalikum is a great 😮😮
That&#39;s quite sad no one in cheering up from Australia😢

Mirror run out click of Smith and Dhoni💔Lots of hope died in second

No one talks about roots incomplete 50, just one run away 😢

2015 - present England&#39;s batting has been phenomenal

I like england bowling🤩👌👍

<a href="">2:24</a> What a throw 🔥

Not so fun

batting 1st on swinging pitch vs batting 2nd after the pitch became flat difference between 2 innings england bat  after pitch became flat if the pitch was same as in 1st innings england would not chase 240 as in final as the pitch was similar in final in both innings

England won by luck 🤞

He is done by only wc win England because Captain Morgan he is hero

England were just too good

Roy was not out Poor decision from Kumar Dharmasena If he was confused then he should have said not out so that Australia can take the review as Bairstow already lost the review for England

Eng deserves 2019 wc cup

No Australia. My country lost 😢.
Our openers should learn from England openers for how to perform in knockouts

This time it is with India in the world cup, in 2019 it did well in batting and bowling and in the semi-finals neither side did it. In 2022, India's batting and bowling did well in the semi-finals and neither did it in the semi-finals and became champion.
Who came here after Eng won T2P wc 2022 ❤️👑
Alex carey plays crcuial roles but underrated ...

For england woakes and stokes doing job But For me Rashid and Archer are champion ND done the job and send them into final

I love chris woakes 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️❤️
This is One of my Sadest day,

England&#39;s Batters Batted Really Nicely

Aus team ka players league phase  mein koyi aur the SM koyi aur

Miss you so much eion morgan 😢
England win world cup 2019

Itna gatiya umpiring
After 1992. Nasser Hussain enjoyed it 😅

Archers played a handful of games and is careers is already over. damaged goods he&#39;s not got the body for cricket.😉 he should of played for is home country West Indies. END OF🤕

<a href="">2:52</a> we talk about the Kohli and Babar Elegance. When Jason Roy gets going, he plays such great cricketing shots. What an amazing player to watch!

Fully fixed to to win england 1st wc trophy

Roy is my favorite ♥️

unforgettable match ever
No matter what Smith never fails to perform in important matches

Roys only impressive innings in this carrier

Jason roy treaten stive smith and i treate bowlers in wcc2 game

Favorite player Jason Roy 😍😍😍
2019

<a href="">5:31</a>

<a href="">0:07</a> I like this part as commentator say &quot;thats the one they were looking for, thats the one they were looking for, given. Given first ball&quot; 😅🏏😁🤣

Roy hits the ball on roof 🤯

There is no other happiness in this world than to watch australia loosing

This semi final was fixed

<a href="">4:09</a> watch Jason Roy reaction 🥰🥰
Changed openers Australia!

England the fake world champions NZ robbed most hollow victory ever in the history of ICC tournaments NZ knock England out of the T20 world cup netball world cup and 7s rugby world cup hahaha revenge

Well played both teams

Why do I feel like every one has watched all of the cwc 2019 matches at least 2 or more times? This wasn&#39;t the way this game was going to pan out in my head when I heard england were playing australia. I thought it was going to be very close, or australia was going to win. As a england supporter, I was very happy at this outcome. But australia played SO differently than this in the group stage leading them up to this. They even beat england pretty badly in the group stage. Smith should have tried to accumulate runs and play out until the end, and the hit out so he could get them to around 250 or so. But when Jason Roy gets started, there is no stopping him. No hate to any teams, reply if you disagree.

I was at this game, absolutely incredible. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen England beat Australia in such a one sided fashion before this game.

JASON ROY My Best Of The Best Player 😎🥰😘

Archer and Roy you buty 🥰🥰😘😘

Woakes and Archer were lit😶‍🌫️

Roy and Woakes sends England to finals Ben Stokes and Buttler makes England win the ICC Wc

Steve Smith was playing just like he had played in 2015wc against India in semifinal. If he had got good support than they would have thrashed England just like India but good bowling from England

Maxwell and Carey should have done better after getting a good start big matches makes big players 👍

I still believe Josh Hazelwood could have done better that behrendroff I know behrendroff did well against eng earlier but Josh is different and zampa in place of lyon 🔥

That was Morgan we knew....

Why Australia didn&#39;t change the openers. If Head, McDermott or Phillipe plays they are better than Finch.

Real batting starts <a href="">2:52</a>

I had to watch this a few times during the last Ashes series!! Just to remember when we were able to beat Australia!!

This semifinal was not exciting as first semifinal. England had won the match single handedly.

BRUTAL hitting approach by England!

2011,2015, 2019 all 3 wc&#39;s won by home countries

Pleasure to watch from <a href="">3:50</a>

Maxwell thinks he’s a power hitter but he’s just a kid in comparison with roy butler hales bairstow stokes and Livingstone

Nowadays England takes Australia like kenya zimbabwe 😂Love England team from India 🇮🇳

&quot;Morgan takes his team to world cup final&quot; - 2019&quot;Morgan announces retirement from international cricket&quot; - 2022Time changes soon 🙃

Most weirdest world cup where a team won the cup by even after a draw match, with those stupid rules.

<a href="">5:38</a>

England played superb.

Jason Roy: That&#39;s how you hit the cricket ball

Out vs tight
typical finch affair! get out without scoring in knockout matches

Smith runout like dhoni 😭

Is this guy the only referee in cricket?

so why are you shocked it can happen i think your brain is in half half of you brain is cutted and it has also happened in ipl india hosted the ipl and all of those ipl indian teams won and in psl all of the pakistani teams hosted and all of the psl pakistani teams won and also in BBL

My fav moment <a href="">4:04</a>

Roy reminded Smith.... why he dropped his career as a bowler..

<a href="">1:50</a> gotta feel for the lone warrior Smith

<a href="">2:53</a> What a classy shot that was.

Roy is my favorite

Fixed

Aus is better than NZ , and Eng is better than Aus ,and  IND is better than both Aus &amp; Eng and NZ is better than IND

Steve Smith won&#39;t bowl to Roy again 🤣🤣

Let&#39;s go into the world of IPL through a poem MI always rocksRR have great traditional folks DC have pet frogsCSK are get set go!How I wonder where to go But one thing is sure LSG have vacant jobs GT got some pure talent!KKR have an OP jerseyOh oh oh have some mercy!!But wait I have a twist for your guys!!Mi always rocks But,RCB will remain dogs And, Aakash sir (The commentator) will be the GOAT AAP party KO Punjab me kariega vote Thank you!!!The teams finishing in top four according to me are-1) Mumbai Indians ( because I am their fan and I know their power, not looking good on paper but can get many in trouble)2) LSG ( They are looking strong on paper and can perform good, they have Gautam Gambhir as a mentor KL Rahul as a captain Ravi bishnoi is a great spinner too, they have Deepak Hooda and Krunal Pandya  and fierce Jason holder now it depends but for me they can make it there.)3) RR ( Halla bol are looking the best and may be the pre tournament favourites, they had a fantastic auction  bowlers are very good Trent Boult, Yuvzi, Ashwin, Parashid Krishna and NCN. They have Jos butter, Sanju Samson and devedut padikal and the interesting factor is that all of these three are in form and scored centuries in the last season they also have James Neesham and Daryl Mitchell and also Rassie Van Der dussen they will make it only worry is management.)PBKS/(will let you know) after an edit by till then!!!

England  is on fire.

Don&#39;t know why Smith always gets out in an impossible way. We have seen that against Sri Lanka, West indies ,New Zealand,England

🌺Devi Padmavathi🌺(Goddess of snakes)  is my father. Yes it is true. I have born by her blessing.  For example I am like Karna ( in the &quot;Mahabhartha&quot;) who was born by the blessing of Lord Surya. If you want any proof please come at Guma Manasa Bare ( very famous temple of my father) in West Bengal and ask here. Here my father comes every Sunday. I not only want that people knows my truth but also I want that everybody knows my father&#39;s power and nobility. Belief or unbelief is your matter. Don&#39;t write nor think any hate speech about my father and serve her. My father blesses you. Thank  you so much..🌹🍒🌹💖🌹

Jason Roy was in mood to play WCC even 400 target would be hard for AussiesWell played by smith

<a href="">2:52</a>

England is Bast

If you don't
Fun Fact: Warner would have gotten the most runs this world cup if he hit 2 more runs (1 to tie).

Smith one man army

<a href="">1:57</a>Smith be like: Salo kuch to sharm Karo. Max ko kis gully se utha laye ?

The umpire was dreadful during the entire world cup

Smith 49❤

2019wc winner -ENGLAND

That moment Jason Roy hit it out the ground was utter perfection! What you didn&#39;t see on the highlights, that you saw on the TV, is the faces of the poor little Bruce&#39;s looking up as it when over their heads and the looks on their faces was an utter joy to watch haha!!! If you want 20 seconds of how important it is for any English team to get one over on the Aussies, that hit is it! Perfection 👌 Sorry Bruce! Better luck in 2023

Roy forgot it&#39;s a odi

Australia best

The same plastic you throw on the ground can go too the sea and be eaten by the same fish that’s been served on your plate,stop poisoning yourself and your loved ones ~use a thrash can❤️❤️

<a href="">04:04</a> when Jason Roy hited 6 was awesome

Yes
<a href="">6:46</a>

England is my favorite team🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰

Who is here after Australia won another World Cup?

England is my angry 😡😡😡😡😡 Wood is a bull
Two runouts in this wcup turned out tobe turning point one dhonis runout and other steve smiths run out.

Jason&#39;s clapping at <a href="">5:00</a> is hilarious he looks like a school kid who got punished for no reason

5 time champion

I play wcc2

Australia didn&#39;t only win 5 world cups but also each World Cup they win in different continents . 1987 - Asia1999 - Europe2003 - Africa2007 - America2015 - Oceania (Australia) 👍

wistindies vs paskitan
Australia played like we don&#39;t want this we have 5 in almarah.

jeson roy, Not out..🤣 😎
<a href="">5:10</a> bgm name?

Alex Carey is a gem to this Australian squad

<a href="">5:01</a> me when my competitor wins

Well done England for beating Australia

Jason Roy treated Steven Smith like l theat bowlers in wcc2 game 😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂

England did the same thing to Australia what australia did to India in WC SF 2015

Woakes op

Bro England has won the World Cup once or Australia has won it 5 times
Same run mai out
Unfortunately Smit and Roy 2 great player same run out

<b>This Kind Of Batting in WC Knockout, Take a bow England!</b>

Woakes treated the Australian batsmen like I treat the batsmen in Wcc2

Feeling sad for usman khawaja not get place in middle order

OP

Who wants to watch this match with me

Jason Roy was on hurry to finish the match 😉😉😉

Yuvraj Singh :🔥🔥🔥 <a href="">
Go England!

, 😇😇😇😘😇😇😘😘😘😘😘😘

2 legends became run out in semifinals, 😔

Both the semis had a brilliant run out at crucial times

Anyone noticed, Root missed his half century by 1 run ?

easy mode

<a href="">04:41</a> saying no but raising the finger 😑😑

Even tho I am a diehard England fan but I really feel that getting Steve Smith out is not a business England excels in

Australia really need some batsman(and bowlers?) bro these ppl won&#39;t do anymore, other than warner, smith and maxwell, they need good batsman now...they give up the moment they allow steve smith to bowl in such low score condition.

It&#39;s a good reavenge from England 🇬🇧

What a player Jason Roy is amazing

Dhoni run out and India loose Smith run out Australia loose

Did anyone notice or heard iPhone meme song in the background

<a href="">1:49</a> that ohh tells us about that ball from archer

what a brilliant match it was

What about buttler&quot;s throw

The mistake of Aron Finch is he elected to bat first on pitch

<a href="">1:34</a>Rashid : aahh? Umpire: Rashid: aaaaah? Umpire : Rashid : aaaaaaaaaaaaah? Umpire: ok (given) 😂😂
Look at Jason Roy reaction <a href="">5:01</a>.

Slow start from Australia

<a href="">5:01</a> thats me during my school assembly

<a href="">4:41</a> adhrmasena
Best 👍
India 🇮🇳 is the best

Morgan was really greedy taking the winning runs and root was on 49 and England needed 2 runs

The day my heart broke again 💔

Pity root didn&#39;t got his fifty/half-century

Chris wokes 💪💪💪😍😍😍
and our indians (except jduu and mahi) surrendered to kiwis

And thus Australia missed her sixth world cup title....

<a href="">4:40</a>

Chris woakes is a superstar.

<a href="">4:06</a>

Wokes nice performance
Roy and Bairstow deadly combination

Alex Carey  added valuable runs to Australia and gives affect on scorecard and which cannot be handled by opponent

Any RC20 fans here?

What&#39;s the beauty from Archer and Jason roy

<a href="">4:03</a> That&#39;s enormous

<a href="">4:04</a> Michael Slater 😂😂
<a href="">1:23</a> tough shot

I can&#39;t believe it that Australia loss semi final 😤😤😤😤
I love that shot when roy was twisting his hands to hit six, still i like that moment

Broooooooooooooooooo the Jason Roy flick

Amusing 🙂🙂😊🔥
Cummins and Carey should not have appealed for jason  Roy it was not good

Australia&#39;s team selection was all wrong for this match. Playing Glenn Maxwell in place of Usman Khawaja was a blunder. It left them with a weak batting line up. With Alex Carrey batting at number 5 it exposed their batting badly. Also why play Marcus Stoinis as an all rounder when his bowling is of little use against a strong England batting line up? Why not play a proper batsman to strengthen the batting?

Roy ended Smith&#39;s bowling career in an over.

ICC needs to learn editing ❤️

I was very happy that Australia didn&#39;t win it. I am very happy for England.

Kumar dharmasena wrong decision Jason roy
<a href="">3:03</a> what a shot!

My. Favrate player. Is  the j barstow but  jason roy best. Oppner

Fixed match

Jason roy punish aussies for five times winning world cup 😎😂😂

This WC was filled with runouts, painful for the losing teams : SF1 : Smith, SF2 : Dhoni, Final : Guptill. These runouts were agony for India, NZ &amp; Australia

Imagine if we won World Cup

Root hit a boundary t

That empire who gaves Roy out, Played Major role In England winner of WC2019......

Jason Roy and Jhonny Bairstow are the best openers after Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan 🤟🤟

Title woakes and Roy send england to final Rashid be like: am I a joke to you

When smith come Boling starc be like - to Mai kya karu job chod du 😅😅😅

I watched this match LIVE .. England played brilliantly.. Jason Roy played fearless cricket. So smoothly , like he didn&#39;t hesitate even a little in hitting those drives and shots .. they made the match completely one sided towards the end, what a great match it was!

I support newz
Jason roy and Smith 85 runs

Australia should have played Usman Khawaja instead of peter Handscomb

Admit it or not jason roy is an all rounder 👀🔥
Jason Roy and Steve smith same score

Jason roy desrv 100
<a href="">4:09</a> roy showed the look on the australians faces

Umpire like u ah out

I support India and Australia but I am Indian

<a href="">1:34</a> umpire be like &quot;chillana band kar out de diya tereliye

Smith and knockout have a same blood❣️

AUS WTF AND ENG WELL PLAYED IN THE FINALS TOO

Steve Smith Is Alone Warrior In Aus Line-up 😭

When I saw it was a highlights of 5 min I thought it is not a full highlights but 😂🤭

Smith,morgan,Williamson are far better captain than kholi. They always play powerful knock in decider match. Kholi is overrated and overconfident 😡😡

Oz crickters are a disgrace period .
cris woaks treated glen mexwell like i treat

<a href="">5:00</a> wat ws that

<a href="">00:37</a>

😀😂😂😂😂😂😂😀😀

Just take a look at Roy,when he was in the pavilion that how much he is angry😂and clapping for every four like awkwardly

I am indian but I love Smith all gameplays

Jason Roy hitting 4 and 6 runs.Meanwhile Bairstow:Mai kya karu job chod du?

Indian fans cheering for England <a href="">1:20</a>

Jason roy ❤️❤️❤️❤️love
Dobo

Ben stokes is my favorite player

Fty

Respect England team from pakistan

Smith&#39;s run out in semifinal 2 and Dhoni s run out in semi final one was heart breaking

Australia play very well but England win

should have been India and Australia but bad luck

<a href="">4:04</a> didn’t understand the commentary

Bairstow looks so cute

<a href="">0:57</a>

I don&#39;t understand how australia team select the team

Let&#39;s talk about Jason Roy 3 balls 3 sixes in Smith over

Bechara Steve Smith got hit for 3 sixes by roy

Stoinis is a very Overrated player in Australia....he should be replaced soon

Expensive Steve smith😂 after that ball tampering

England

England deserves to be world cup champion
Though I don&#39;t watch that much Cricket, nowadays I am watching as I am at home, so I am watching the highlights of World Cup matches.England played very well, Love you England from New Zealand!

Happy birthday smith

One like for sumit

<a href="">2:24</a> One of the most underrated throws in cricket history.

Jason treating smith like kidsSmith to roy:came in ashes

Smith run out aus lose semi final. Dhoni run out India lose semi final

Smith and Dhoni both are my fav of all time

<b>Joe Root My Favorite Batsman Please Joe Root Ko Sport Karo</b>

Oh that flick shot from roy what a beauty❤️....love him so much😎

I think Australia dont want to win more world cups they have sufficient. 5world cup in their name.

What a irony British vs British??🤐

Jason Roy is underrated player

england 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 superb country.
I treat bowlers to every ball boundary in wcc2.. just like Jason Roy treats Steve Smith with hat trik sixes..

The Fact is thatIn &quot;semi Final&quot; -1 INDIA 5-3 wicketsIn &quot;semi final&quot; -2 AUSTRALIA 14-3☝☝☝🤔🤔🤔🤔What the CWC19 playoffs was Fix🤔🤔

Opening batsmen and opening bowlers of eng were the reason behind the success . Roy was in his peak form of his life .

Both the Semis had crucial runouts at crucial times.Coincidentally both Dhoni and Smith completed fifties in 72 balls.

De villiers 10 best sixes
What a run out from Buttler <a href="">2:22</a>

<a href="">

F Australia! I love England! Yayyy!!! Was a great world cup indeed!😍😍😍

Marys ha, Avludhan,
Two throws made difference of from Buttler and 2 from Guptill

Superb ball for Warner

its cheated because the super over was also tied

Joe root is the best part time off-spinner among smith,Williamson,kholi.

Smith is good

Unexpectedly England Won the Match

But still Australia is better than England after defeating them in bilateral series by 2-1 in their homeground

Roy is my favorite player

Aaron finch wicket is a game changing wicket

Archer woakes wood rashid deadly bowler

<a href="">

in ind vs zea semi final dhoni run outeng vs aus semi final steve smith out almost with same strike wow!

Smith always performs under pressure

Honestly we always says Virat is best but in pressurised situations he never plays good innings...like Steve smith, kane Williamson and joe Root plays...

All people only talk about Williamson see how calm always Morgan is .

1st SF: well Playing Dhoni RunoutIndia lose2nd SF:well Playing Smith RunoutAustralia loseFinal: well Playing Guptil Runout on last ball of super overRest is history

Jason roy very handsome cricketer

Jason Roy  treated Steve Smith the same way as I treat the bowlers of WCC2😂😂😂Lol😂😂😂

I liked the bashing of Starc.

Me in wcc2 666646 Roy in in world 66666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666.......

Root fifty not happens

<a href="">5:56</a> goosebumps 🙂

<a href="">4:06</a>

4:6

Does&#39;nt matter aus 5 time champion
In both the semi finals the heartbreaking thing was Smith&#39;s and dhonis run out😢

Mostly Roy played like 400+ yarget

The best team in the world, these are the few batting opening pairs of England. Jason Roy is Johnny Bairstow. 🙌 CONGRATULATIONS CAPTAIN MORGAN Dhoni has won the match after 1983 and England is having bad luck but salute captain Morgan for showing his talent.
<a href="">0:29</a>- My maths exam


Jason Roy😍😎
Ok who got recommended after 1 year😒😒

In SRH = Warner and Bairstow openers in AUS vs ENG they were opponents...🧡🧡

<a href="">1:51</a> maxwell&#39;s reaction... ohhhh😮
india and australia conditions were same in the starting few overs in the semi finals...😭😞

This is the match of ind and new Zealand

Yuzvendra chahal 174 miter six against with aus Mitchel Starc 😁

What A Memorable Night Was This When England Was Just One Step Away From Becoming The New World Champion

<a href="">1:58</a>, I feel so bad for smith, I’m a big fan of smithy

<a href="">2:28</a> time when england made to finals

Smith v root please

Australia v england semi final head to head2004 c/t semi finalEngland won2019 w/c semi finalEngland won

Eng win

No one can can defeat their teacher or father

srh has jason and that dumb srh management not using him worst management ever

<a href="">2:32</a> where the Aussies lose

<a href="">

Go and play football ⚽️ boys

Only srilanka can defeat England specilally malinga

Aus lost eng win

Rohit should learn from ROY how to play innings in big matches👏🏿👏🏿

Best performance by eng

nice

This is pak vs ind 2nd match Pak Won but ind was scared to face us

Very relatable

Jason roy srh

John Morgan 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
man nobody noticed the pace of mitch starc , 150 and 149 KM

I like Kohli more than Smith but Smith is by far better performer in big stages than Kohli

&quot;England has incredible grounds for World Cup matches&quot;

Steve Smith best player  and vell play England  and Jason roy

england are selected world champion like selected PM imran khan

Zampa should in place of lyon, marnus labuchagne should in place of handscomb

Australia shouldn&#39;t have bowled to Roy when they heard the music at <a href="">4:09</a>SHOT ON IPHONE 🤣🤣

Yellow yellow dirty fellow🤣🤣

I thought during this match 2inning Australia will do bowling than Australia will be in final but i was wrong England has defeated very easily and entered in finale worldcup

result are in the title of this vid

England should not have won because australia is better

This is what Australia used to do with other teams in the knockouts of early 2000s tournaments

<a href="">3:56</a> power of bubble gum 😂

England show their class on the Semifinal 😇

Actually Roy and Bairstow send England to worldcup

Jason Roy absolutely destroyed Australia

India doesn&#39;t won because of the loss of ambati Rayburn as didn&#39;t got no 4 batsman

<a href="">4:03</a>- why wasn&#39;t this six considered in the biggest sixes of world cup 2019. It has gone 101 meters.

Steve simth and MS dhoni both were run out on the semis 😢😢

Best innings for Roy
Roy the fearless batsman.

So no one is going to talk about Steve smith and how great he was?

I don&#39;t know but when it&#39;s edgbaston ground always England won lol

Is nathon lyon a commentator, seriously?

Very Very sorry

Who is here after India defeated England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 in ODI...?? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fact:- The target for Eng was same to the Run made by indian team in 2nd semifinal.

Sorry aus I go for you

hu

Cheating

You beat Australia in Knockouts you deserve to be the champion

Downfall of Aussies Started from this Match

Australia won the toss &amp; chose to....... 😆😆🤣🤣😄
Sky blue Jersey is the lucky Jersey for England, 1992 , 2019 in same Jersey

Srh fans assemble🔥❤️
eng played like oz and oz played like eng
Australia ki middle order mein batting bahaut weak hai,ek time tha jab Andrew Symonds jaise khilaadi middle order mein aakay dhaamaaka krtay thay,Maxwell bharosemand nhi

India has not performed in the knock out matches of ICC tournament since 2011.
New Zealand is champions actually

If australia in final...they are champions

feeling bad for smith he is really a hero love from india

Steven SMITH the lone warrior

Roy is such a good batsman

Rohit warner were briliant

I like joe root.Because of following reasons:1. His simile2. His captaincy in test3. His drives.  i.e. cover drives 4. His batting.

It so ironic England whom kept Zimbabwe out of test cricket for so many years adopted Graeme Hick Zimbabwe brightest batting star

England and Australia had never care a puppy tail about the progress game in the associate countries all they care about who can won the Ashes . South Africa should have been praise for allowing Zimbawe for playing in her four - day domestic which helped Zimbabwe emerged as test playing countries. England had never allowed Scotland , Netherland or Ireland to play in their first class four - day domestic league yet they allow them in their one day league knowing one day game hardly improve in a player . What England do is to use talented players from some of these countries to bolster their test team. Australia had never allow neighbouring Pau New Guinea to play in their domestic four - day league that this countries can get the experience to come into test cricket.

England and Australia for years treated test cricket like their own personal toy telling whom come out to play . For many years these two white nation pretented Zimbabwe from playing test cricket . One ask if the ICC body is a fuzzy organization ? How could they allow England and Australia to have such monopoly

<a href="">0:07</a> golden duck for finch
:nice:

worst umpire
Never underestimate Jason Roy he can any time play a destructive inning

Austrlia not much good now like earliet

Both semifinals had a crucial run out of dhoni and smith and also had two crucial lbw as well of both losing captains kohli and finch

Whatever happened in the final.... That does not take away from the fact that this England team deserved the success as much as new zealand did...... Very well balanced squad

Good performance roy

England J&#39;s combination players are lethal Jason, Jonny, Jos, Joe ,Jofra,

One of the most one sided matches I&#39;ve seen in recent times. Aussies were clueless how to bat and ball while England played perfectly 10/10

Luck plays a massive part in sport

<a href="">4:41</a> dharmsena pays off of roy&#39;s wicket for meaning less wicket in final

so it was all run outs that changed the course of the game.

<a href="">2:32</a>Smith&#39;s runout was similar to that of Dhoni&#39;s runout

2011 : <b>India hosted WC, India won WC</b>2015 : <b>Australia hosted WC, Australia  won WC</b>2019 : <b>England hosted WC, England won WC</b>

Why did dharamasena did that  at <a href="">4:42</a> 🤣🤣

What was that dance by jason roy about?

All knows by unfairly England won the world cup .

Highlights of this match is SwaG off Jason Roy😂😂

Roy do a Large 6
k, lol

Finchi comes Finchi goes! The RCB effect!

The talented gear totally grate because battery bilaterally milk into a comfortable surname. lively, placid edger

Revange england
Brilliant ❣️ performance
Australia ka dominance ab khatam ho chuka hai 2019 World Cup loose Ashes tie 2019 after wcInd aus Series 2020 lose

Archer the man too (Maxwell and Finch)

Is no one going to talk about Smith’s 85?

I love Chris woaksh bowling action ❤️❤️❤️
What about Adil rashed

Outstanding
Finch and Warner both destructively batted the whole world cup season but in the important time they both got out

Really England deserves this World Cup. :3

0;22 super catch
Icc:Woakes and Roy send england to final.Adil Rashid:Am I joke to you?

Woakes is the most underrated England player ❤

There is run outs in both semi finals and they are heart breaking.

All best batsman were runout during semi finals.  Steve Smith.  Ms Dhoni.  Ross Taylor.  Etc

I think England is best team

Buttler agrassive run-out is the best.🔥

J Roy my favourite batsman

Referral codeAASALA3GH

Jason Roy reminds me of Sehwag.... No fear😍

What a start from Woaks! What a strike from Jason Roy!

Explosive innings by Jason roy,,,,,🏏

Referral codes AASALA3GH

Roy is Hero





Eoin Morgan was at the receiving end back in 2015 but what he&#39;s done to this side is commendable

England openers after 2015 World Cup right from Eng vs Nz series in May 2015 have completely changed their ODI batting wayThese players are just wow 🔥

Cheerio cheerio 🔥🔥😂😂😂
My favourite moment was Steve Smith was bowling

I like this match

Root should have made his 50

Ben stokes great cricketer for all time❣️❣️❣️
Australia could have played better

What a comeback for England australia 3 wickets down only 13 score and Australia batting and bowling lose and England win this match

Smith 👌

Smith Was More important in this Semifinal than Dhoni Was in the other..But Still Indian Fans Cry On Dhoni&#39;s Runout..Thats The Spirit Of Game.Those Who win Shall Not Cry all time on Loss.

Please Take a minute to watch my short clip..<a href=""> you can&#39;t memorize that you can&#39;t memorize

ENGLAND WON THE WORLD CUP

Australia and India both failed when their openers failed

Oh! What a match for Jason Roy.😲😲😲

World xi vs aus
This was the best England one day team ever

England is a best team

Archer bouncer to MaxiChirs bouncer to Warner🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I mean Australia played very loosely

Final chances : England Vs IndiaEngland Vs New ZealandIndia Vs EnglandIndia Vs AustraliaAustralia Vs IndiaAustralia Vs New Zealand

India knockout because England is not a place for World Cup because weather is not good in such a situation even team will better performs but bad weather stopped the game But Ind 🆚 Nz game rain not happened weather will good then I think India wents up to the final.....

I can&#39;t stop laugh at 4.40 😂😂

when stokes was bowling u can see that smith had a struggle bec hes smallbec stokes is bigger than him thats why

I really enjoyed this match COZ Australia always shows attitude that we never lose match In semi finals and this time also we are d champions again.but England performance shows right direction to Australia.

Smith is a big match player he proved it again

I want in 2021 ipl anyone knock out Mumbai Indians like this

Australia murder scene
Same like india vs  newzealand onesided match

1st semifinal dhoni run out 2nd semifinal smith runout

Believe Me or Not...Its a Heart Breaking World Cup 2019 : England and Wales

Thanks so much for your email find you well I think it would really like the idea that design makes a

England is cheating in  super over

Kumar Dharamsena should be banned.By the way, Roy resembles Beckham...

England

If you ever feel depressed, then think about david warner! He was just 2 runs behind rohit sharma for wc 2019 leading run scorer!!!

My favorite is jose butler

I&#39;m an Indian but always supported England. Am glad they have won the cup. I couldn&#39;t believe that they invented cricket and it&#39;s the first world cup they&#39;ve ever won

Morgan the man who brought revolution in the England cricket, huge respect.

Jason roy-the lion.

I have never seen Aussies playing this worse!

<a href=""> MUST watch - - Pakistan vs England 2001 natwest series thriller match at Lords in HQ

Jason roy 0 in 2nd over vs pat cumins. But wrong umpiring. Aaron Finch given out on 0. See in final also against trent boult Jason roy on 0 in 1st over but wrong umpiring and he scored 85 and 27 in semifinals and finals. See the match changing moment. Ross Taylor was not out in final. Other wrong umpiring. Martin Guptill throw to Ben stokes other wrong umpiring. Jason roy was out on 25 also against India on hardik pandaya ball but wrong umpiring. Aus vs eng 3rd test 4th inning wrong umpiring 4-6 times against Australia.  Especially when jack leach was out when 2runs needed and Nathan lyon was bowling. Pak vs eng 2nd t20 Eoin Morgan was 0 out against shadab khan but wrong umpiring umpire call what against arron finch in semifinals. England is luckiest team in cricket😭. That&#39;s why they won. Otherwise they don&#39;t deserve anything. Sl vs eng match and world Cup changing moment. When Joe root was out after lasith malinga taken DRS. 🇦🇺 is unluckiest team in cricket still they are successful as compared to other team. England luckiest team that&#39;s why nowadays they look strong. Other wise they are weak. They can loose series against Ireland also 2020. But wrong umpiring. West Indies vs eng 1st test 2020. 6 wrong umpiring desicion against west Indies.

I believe its adil rashid who should be in title lol. Got break through when partnership was building

<a href="">1:58</a> Smith seems disappointed 😩

Steve Smith😍, when team is in struggle...

<a href="">4:41</a> what is is saying and why?

Actually I&#39;m a bangladeshi. But i always love england fans and england players. England is always my second country

This is fixed match because Elizabeth gives money for loose and australia has lost it and If you can see Smith is playing Slow and Warner Have need to play Pull Shot and Why Finch not take the Out chance So that&#39;s why Australia bowlers throw  slow balls this is the reason

I love to play for ENGLAND CRICKET

England is a poor

<a href="">4:06</a>

i think that due overconfidence India lost the game against NZ......and only the first 3 players had overconfidence  and over smartness..that NZ is a very weak team and we can easily win the match

<a href=""> check and subscibe

Jason Roy nice player 👌♥️
<a href="">

Australia vs england semi final.2 england win 😁😁😀😃😍😍😀😁
Odt

Why u all are running after Steve Smith ,he does good only in tests ,but he is not a match winner only he can pile up runs for his team ,but he can&#39;t finish match when his team is under pressure ,there are other players also who are doing hardwork ,u have to also see other players

Stokes takes all the plaudits for winning the World Cup. However, without the blistering form of Jason Roy, we wouldn&#39;t have even made it out of the group. Player of the tournament for me.

I think that batting order wasn&#39;t right Handscomb is not a good choice at that position... Steve Smith should&#39;ve been sent at No 3 and Stoinis at no 4 because Smith rotates strike and Stoinis can play Fast bowlers well ...in the middle Alex Carey and Maxwell can play spin well and are a good finishers..

<a href="">4:04</a> - <a href="">4:07</a> who knows what the commentator was saying

Eng worth it
Smith is always one man  army.

Who thinks Australia win before macth start like here

1 minute silence for those who thought pakistan would win this world cup🤣🤣

Tamil

Can someone tell me what “gaurd middle stump” means?

Jason Roy cover drives were mind blowing and his.innings is one of the best innings of world cups.Love from.Pakistan

England bowling snd england to the final

foundation for England&#39;s most of the victory is the  Roy -Bairstow  partnership

England murdered Australia here.

When  australia gets  out of world cup it feels satisfying.😌

WC2011 : Host &amp; Winner - IndiaWC2015 : Host &amp; Winner - AustraliaWC2019 : Host &amp;.Winner - England

I think after pakistan ausrtalia is also a big choker team like pakistan

Starc was waste of time

Fixing match fixing would cup England loser team

Whether it&#39;s any team opposition but it&#39;s satisfying to see Defeat of Aussies in World Cup

Jason Roy batting in wc<a href="">#2019</a> always turn in the favour of ENGLAND...

Alex Carey has great dedication ball hit on his chin though he continued playing for his country. Though Australia lost the match a great salute to this player

Jason Roy really played like sehwag for England during the entire tournament

I just love the English crowd🥰, very cheerful

Indians fans dont become said because virat is ahead from finch beacause he scored 1 runs in semi final and finch got out for duck

Watch 03:3 amezing shot
Good  innings by Jason   Roy

IT WAS JUST SO EASY FOR THEM

<a href="">2:28</a> ball just passed away between his legs😲 HIT LIKE IF YOU NOTICED!

India are chokers in world cup

Who are waiting for 2023 cricket world cup im waiting

Whenever I WATCH THIS MATCH I CRY&#39;S BECAUSE I AM AUSSIE FAN

Do a like for Morgan 👇🌟💯
look at the umpire at <a href="">4:40</a> he is saying no but raising his finer ......not and out

Stoins out with eng and India 0

Unlike Virat Kohli, Steve Smith scores runs even in the big games. 😢 I wish Virat came big in big moments more often

Eng won by 0 runsNz lost by 0 runsTrophy should be shared

That&#39;s world cup history man. Those teams never won the world cup whose middle order is not scoring runs. No matter they reaches semi finals or finals or top the group stage as like India.

Eion morgan is ahero

England is back

England is back in the bollAnd  bat

<a href="">3:03</a> what a shot

Playing semifinal against a team like australia without any pressure.. Amazing

<a href="">4:03</a> That&#39;s what happens if you get the perfect timing and power at the same time.

Who is the very powerful team1.Australia like2. ENGLAND COMMENT

india 5-3 ended up 221 on a tough trackaus 14-3 ended up 223 on easy tracksmith only wasted balls like what dhoni ...this created undue pressure on lower players like jadeja and maxwell amt. of runs doesnt matter ...it matters how your innings made a differencejadeja 77(58) did make a diff but smiths 85(119) didnt anyways coming after 1 year .... still hurts that the top performers of d league stage vanished cheaply...

Happy birthday

Australia was struggling by good bowling by england archer,chris woakes and adil Rashid

Where was the last wicket of Australia ?

SUPER  ENGLAND

When Jason Roy not out in Semifinal 2 so he hits a century cheaters umpires who giving him out that&#39;s a wide ball I am sad that Jason Roy doesn&#39;t make its century 😞😞😭😞 If u also sad so plz like He made his second century when he was not out in Semifinal 2. 😔

<a href="">4:20</a>Chasing 224 and opener play with this rate.Wow!!!

This match was a dream match ... Beating Aussies in a semi final

Steve Smith forgot how to bowl his bowling career is now over.

<a href="">5:00</a>😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 actually roy stopped himself because he saw camera is in front of him. otherwise he would clap on the face of his partner🤣🤣🤣

Australia Ka semi final wala pattern end

INDIA and AUSTRALIA will take revenge in next world cup.😢😈

Whoever beats Aussies in knockouts, wins the world cup.1996 - SL beats Australia in the world cup final and won the world cup.2011 - India beat Aussies in the world cup quarter-final and won the world cup.2019 - England thrashes Aussies in the semi-final and they won the world cup.Similarly in football, whoever beats Germany in knockouts, wins the world cup.2002 - Brazil beats Germany in the World cup final and won the world cup.2006 - Italy beats Germany in the semi-final and they won the world cup.2010 - Spain beats Germany in the semi-final and they won the world cup.

I think unofficially actually we got 2 winners of wc 2019Both ENG &amp; NM EW ZEALAND😊👌💐

I love England cricket team

Smith the alone warrior

England is best

Roy was robbed of a semi final century

Aussies were clearly lacking due to Khawaja’s injury😓

Bairstow should not have reviewed

Very poor decision by umpire for Roy

Roy was the winning Hero of WC2019

Kumar dharmasena..said NO..then out..😂
I was happy because both the teams &quot;ENG and NZ&quot; never win wc ones . England won first time I was happyInd already won 2 timesIf NZ won I also happy

Well the scorecards are reversed ,  10 years ago Australia used to have England&#39;s scorecard and England used to have Australia&#39;s scorecard..

India can play wc final with aus but in their dreams😂😂😂

England crushed Australia in this knockout match

Who is watching this in 2020

Jason Roy Play nice
Change the title of the video to &#39;Jason Roy buried the Mighty Aussies&#39;

Never seen this class of batting in any match

England side not great bowlers but still beat other teams easily

plz explain someone <a href="">3:40</a> what kind of shot

final ind vs Australia

At <a href="">2:40</a>, anyone else just go &quot;that&#39;s not bloody unfortunate&quot;

Green in the Australian jersey is unpleasant. Earlier deep green shade was better,especially that which was worn in 2015 cwc and 2017 CT.

Smith run out from 😂😂😂😂

how many watching this in lockdown

Smith again proved he is the Best batsman in crucial matches

<a href="">2:32</a> why this match is similar to ind vs new Zealand

Great bowling.

Not the best Australian eleven. stoinis was an absolute wastage throughout the tournament. Australia loose it&#39;s prideful middle order history .That&#39;s not their best bowling lineup. Josh wasn&#39;t picked.Maxwell was in the lineup even after  failed too many occasions.  performance depends only on dev, Aaron Steve and starc. This was the worst Australian line up played in a world cup semi&#39;s in tha last 32years.Aaron was an unlucky captain because he couldn&#39;t win like his predecessors

Very good

<a href="">4:41</a> if gand phat gayi had a face

<a href="">4:05</a> what a shot!

Eng and nz the 2 teams for whom no one is jealous

Mitchell Starc...Bowling 149/150+ ...Speed ....But totally went useless....Cause Pace is Good ..But Until u r not using it as a weapon like targetting the Body or well directed bouncers to head or Shoulders..Then World Class batsmen like <a href="">#Root</a> <a href="">#Morgan</a> will just surpass like this ...<a href="">#WellPlayedEngland</a> 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

On my birthday November 15 this year we&#39;re gonna have the same match but as a T20I Final

Admit it or not australia fully fixed that match. Look the shot from Maxwell  !!  really ?  On a batting pitch he played liked that clueless shot !!  they thrashed England in their previous game like they were playing against a school team..but on this match  !! 😪  I can bet this match was totally fixed by england. Well paid Australia 👏👏

Australia would posted 300 if Smith and Carey have played for little longer

An irish has changed the english white ball cricket...england would never have thought to play odi cricket in so aggresive manner.....well done morgan💞

Any one in lockdown.

Where is usman khawaja??

Biggest mystery everWhat was Marcus Stoinis&#39;s contribution in this WC

I am Bangladeshi... So Love it.. England team.. I support England 💖💖💖💖

Lol 😂Roy scored 85 with almost half the balls Smith took for his 85 ...some people should stick on to playing test cricket.. limited overs is more about strike rates !!

Polish

Watching New Zealand match, hoon sun video from Pakistan also from Pakistan

Only runout can send Smith to the pavilion

India will win in 2023

When Australia was struggling Steve Smith and Alex Carey stitched a good partnership

Roy is dangerous batsman
<a href="">1:10</a> Carey’s catching practice to Vince.

Roy from good bating

Brilliant

Jason Roy makes hitting huge sixes so easy. Same goes for starc , he bowls consistently above 145km/hr and he makes it looks easy. Such simple bowling action

England&#39;s best opening pair Roy and Bairstow

If semi final is between india and Australia then who will win

That&#39;s a brilliant way to shut ricky ponting

Jason Roy dangerous
What&#39;s up with Dharmsena at <a href="">4:43</a>?

umpiregate version 2.0, but happy that eng won, Dharma-say-naa xD

Normally roy scores 1 run against Australia 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Well done 👍🏾 roy big achievement 85 runs
Roy, the face of fearless cricket.

Its was too easy... Australian batting line up was very poor.

England deserves this

<a href="">0:05</a> &quot;first ball 4&quot;<a href="">0:12</a>  &quot;given first ball&quot;

ICC has perfectly managed to ruin match highlights by reducing a whole match for just 5 to 7 minutes.

@<a href="">4:46</a> asshole saying no and raising his finger😄😄

Who is the very powerful team1.Australia like2. ENGLAND COMMENT

I remember that match. Mitchel stark tries his best to out England, every ball clicks 150+ speed.

And rugby
