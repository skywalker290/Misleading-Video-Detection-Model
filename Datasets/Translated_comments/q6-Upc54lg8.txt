<a href="">9:04</a> I&#39;m not surprised that the comments on the video are now turned off.

The Berlin Wall worked for almost 30 years until the USSR agreed to tear it down.

Why were those 22 other people not vaccinated?

Having a Japanese passport is not what makes a person ethnically Japanese.

Does Felix believe he isnt a millenial?

As an engineer I confirm that we don&#39;t have sex

<a href="">1:14</a> that fucking happened to my friend so maybe not a facepalm (unless the facepalm is the reaction to the article, than i am the facepalm

The inteo didn&#39;t age well

He knows that you can still catch diseases if you see vaccinated, right?

Which one
Your eyes look great. Perfect

Meet Rodney

<a href="">4:51</a> I feel like this isn’t a facepalm. It’s just a mother learning from mistakes.

I’ve never gotten a flu shot and I’ve never gotten the flu. My brother gets the flu quite often tho. But even still. I’ve never had it. So I will never get the shot. But obviously I’m vaccinated because I’m not a moron..

people who don&#39;t have arms - ............

<a href="">11:47</a>18 is 50% bigger than 12... right... or am I being dumb here. Im sure it is correct lol

Pewds for President, so he can ban kids.

Bruh 12 oz is the whole bottle so 50% more of 12 oz is 6 oz making the total 18 oz, how&#39;s that even hard math?

<a href="">9:48</a> pewds sounds like he’s joking and he might be,  but it’s not a bad idea.

<a href="">4:05</a>

So sick of this dude&#39;s anti-American comments. Wake the hell up, dude, the US has a much higher average income than Sweden. You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.

<a href="">12:51</a>  He’s a comedian, it’s a joke.

Wtf that Kure at the start

<a href="">10:12</a> No we&#39;re not all annoying, that has nothing to do with veganism, she&#39;s just a Karen.To be fair, I understand not liking the smell because it disgusts you but they have the right to make BBQ in their garden, she was f-ing dumb to sue them smh

21k

<a href="">0:45</a> well that didn&#39;t age well...

Talking alpt abput vaccines before covid hit

People are just dumb. There is no hope. Social media pushing the dumbest agendas. Drama.

The person criticizing the yukata-wearing Japanese girl and the &quot;if you are white you can&#39;t speak Spanish&quot; person are wrong in so many ways that I would need an entire TED Talk to mention them all ️I specially mean the second one, as I&#39;m a Spaniard lmao

This video is very weird post cvirus

I&#39;ve never heard pewdiepie say retarded before lmao never noticed that

<a href="">12:40</a> This will never not piss me off. I have to skip this whenever it comes up. People try to insult Thomas when he’s one of the kindest and most genuine person I’ve ever met. I’ve been following him for years now, and I saw this tweet when it happened. He did not ask them to put it there, and if you knew even the slightest thing about him, you’d know that. He says they recognized him from ordering from them so frequently in the replies too, but even if you don’t believe him, believe me, getting him to compliment himself is extremely challenging. He didn’t do that. It makes me so mad that people spread a false image of a person around making them seem like a completely different person than they actually are, ESPECIALLY if that person is as sweet and caring as Thomas is.

To be fair the wall did slow people down.

<a href="">10:55</a>I would have stopped and asked her to get out.

You have a Calcium deficiency Felix. You can tell by the white flecks on your finger nails.

Fact: 1/10lb burger is McDonald&#39;s cheeseburger. Just a regular cheeseburger. If you make it a Mcdouble, it&#39;d be a 2/10 lb burger.

To be fair. Who wants to eat something called &quot;a third burger&quot;?

Matthew 10:38, 39. Whoever does not take up his cross, and follow after me, is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Jesus is speaking in this word that those who prefer the things of the world, sin, entertainment and reject him, are not worthy of him. Taking up the cross and following Jesus means crucifying oneself to worldly things. People on the contrary are wanting to find their lives in this world, they don&#39;t want to lose their lives to follow it, they don&#39;t want to lose fun, sinful pleasures, lust, fame, etc., etc. Many think they can live a little longer, when they are old, they accept Jesus. We move to the other side when we least expect it, we often don&#39;t have time to do that. You will be lost and in torment afterwards. Don&#39;t delay, he calls you. Hugs!

I wonder of pewds realizes that his country Sweden is ACTUALLY putting microchips in people&#39;s hands.....the irony of him making fun of it

Journalism is basically dead in America.

<a href="">4:02</a> Out of all languages he could’ve spoken he chose to speak facts 

<a href="">0:42</a> it’s actually embarrassing I had to check the year on this video because the clip made too much sense

VAX comments did not age well.

man i love his videos but disagree with his opinions so much

No pewds they used to die off before the rest of the population had to know they were dumb but instead we put warnings on things

tbh I think maths is terrorism. much terror. number is frighten 

<a href="">3:51</a> the dog going straight to the meat made me so sad. i see a malnourished animal who is being denied their natural instincts and functions all for the sake of a narcissists delusions

Anyone came here for Kuru Facepalm?

It’s crazy how much fax he’s speaking tho

Avocados are a fruit yuh &quot;big brain&quot; 
if the sister is half his age when he&#39;s 6 that means shes 67  massive facepalm pewds

wtf, the Berlin wall did actually work, but it also did require the threat of death in addition.

I like how how the boomers hate kids yet if kids didn’t know technology how would they have tv

50% of 12 oz = 6 oz / 6 oz + 12 oz = 18 oz
I can walk on water. It&#39;s called ice.

So the post made by an athiest calling out a religious person calling out athiests is bad, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with the religious person calling out athiests in the post?

Most Nigerian movies are cringier than T-Series!Source: a Nigerian.

<a href="">2:09</a> one nation, one station, one love

R/facepalm is basically just r/adultsarestupid instead of kids are stupid

<a href="">10:17</a> The answer is actually 67

The reason why people get the flu vaccine every year is because it evolves.

<a href="">10:13</a> That was probably the biggest facepalm, I EVER felt. Especially because of the &quot;let´s have a hard one next time, please!&quot;.(btw, the real answer, that I came up with was 67!)

Her sister is <b>67</b> ‍️
The Karen that reported the language was sooo awkward

<a href="">6:57</a> the math thing is stupid but I think it&#39;s more dumb that the women told airline people that there could be a problem because she saw a foreign language

You ask how these people  exist  it&#39;s called freedom

Well actually people did get dumber ever since leaded gasoline was a thing since it damages brain

I will make a 1/1000 pound of a burger! For $1000

Soap operas are crazy. You got twins that both get passed by the devil. The brother is married to his sisters best friend, and his sister was with this doctor until he found out from the brother while possessed, that the sister and her friend hooked up. There’s so much more to that story.

“What are they gonna do next? Put chips in our hands?” Um YES Felix, yes. Prophecy is jumping off the pages. Read Revelations ️

I once watched a nigerian movie and legit smoke came out of my computer. Coincidence? Don&#39;t think so.

I know this comment is very late and he&#39;ll probably never read this but it&#39;s kinda sad that people dont know that the avocado market is very much influenced by the cartels that exist in Mexico because of how profitable it is

Sister would have been 3 when he was 6 and 6-3=3 so 70-3=67So she is 67 when he is 70

okay 1 thing I am now holding against pewds....is that he doesn&#39;t know one of the most popular movies of all time (if anyone else doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s called the breakfast club you should go watch it!)

WHERE IS POOPDIE ITS 2022!!

that movie was The Breakfast Club, about a group of emotionally fucked up teenagers getting detention together.

Isn&#39;t it obvious that KuruHS is at the start of this video?

Rip breakfast club

its my future, i want to be a virgin. phd can wait

The true try not to facepalm is the fact that he doesn&#39;t know what the breakfast club is

People always claim that they are in that field, like the mechanic one but doesn&#39;t know a manual transmission car. WTF

<a href="">3:32</a> just like earth was also observed to be round.

<a href="">7:19</a> mine starts eith a 0 and followed by a 5

&quot;i didn&#39;t facepalm, i clicked of this video&quot;

<a href="">9:45</a> - boy have i got a country for you

OMG Felix, how do you NOT KNOW the cult-classic movie &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;?!!  You have to watch it!

<a href="">1:40</a>  as an atheist  i dont care what religion your a part of, but i think its so fucking cringe calling people out for being religious

Not knowing breakfast club by the photo.... We disown you from the middle generation lol

Hi

Lmao pewds saying “the goverment needs to vaccinate everyone” before covid even started

I really appreciate Felix’s take on cultural appropriation, I feel insane when everyone acts like its a problem

<a href="">1:43</a>Spain, and a good part of LATAM:BRuH

An avocado is a fruit not a vegetable

<a href="">0:45</a> this aged well…

Hey I&#39;m a future visitor, I&#39;m here from 2022

Mechanic lol she cant tell the difference between an automatic and a manual car

She&#39;s 67 years old

Felix, the influenza vaccine is very important. The virus mutates so often. If you got your shot last year, you’re not covered for those mutated strains. I would hope people get it in Europe considering how cold your winters are, which means the flu can spread like wildfire because everyone is inside away from the cold. I kinda wish he wouldn’t speak on topics he’s ignorant about. Especially on topics like this where his opinions have impact. Medical professionals come into contact with sick people every day. They have a social responsibility.

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re mad about atheists being right

why did you say the r slur

&quot;the gov&#39;t just needs to step in and vaccinate everyone&quot; wow that quote aged...interestingly

<a href="">2:22</a> What? I did not know that you were between the ages of 42 and 57

yes oregon portland sucks

<a href="">2:30</a> breakfast club bruh
hearing about vaccines now from 3 years ago is quite funny odd and weird at the same time

The measel one I almost face palmed

I feel like every engineer can agree with the engineer thing

...this just came into my recommended.. :44 &quot;this is where the government just needs to step in and vaccinate everyone&quot;.... Wtf

Cmon Pewds we all know your religion is Water Sheepism

&quot;I don&#39;t know what movie this is&quot;Respect -75

“I dont think you need to get vaccinated for every flu, that seems stupid”<b>*Famous last word*</b>

With the age one if she was 6 then her sister was 3 and now she&#39;s 70 which means it&#39;s been 64 years so her sister is 67.

Reviews r/facepalmSays &quot;over 300,000 K avocado?!&quot;
It looks like he just ate an edible

Who is kuru?

Who is kuru?

Bruh! Almost died breathing faluda bro

<a href="">0:00</a> kuruhs appears
this video has documented evidence that pewdiepie has never seen the breakfast club

What kind of person hasn’t see the breakfast club , your goin to hell Felix

It&#39;s actually 99.4031%. Facts.

<a href="">10:46</a> ive thought about this almost every week for like 2 years

British

Genz now it is the boomer Revolution

Did the woman on the airplane really thought that if a terrorist was about to do some shit they would be there casually writing &quot;Dear diary, today I&#39;m going to explode an airplane&quot;

That math one was honestly confusing, if it’s a language you don’t understand, why alert security?

How did the Berlin wall not work?

<a href="">2:29</a> breakfast club

<a href="">0:37</a> well look at us all now

math is dangerous in the wrong hands

No no he’s right about being an engineer

<a href="">10:20</a> she was 6 and her sister 3 now she is 70 so 6+64 is 70 and 3+64 is 67 her sister is 67 and not 35 

Watching in 2022 “put chip in hand” it’s happening.

The first minute didn&#39;t age really well!

30 seconds in ages like fine milk

<a href="">0:29</a> Didn&#39;t age well

What if u have no hands? Do you automatically win? Or do u lose?

I&#39;m 8 years  old

He sed I&#39;m dumb

I&#39;m in grade three  and I&#39;m smarter than a person in 4th grade

I don’t understand cultural appropriation either. It’s weird when others wish for equality but won’t let others indulge in what makes their life special.

As a mechanical engineering student i can assure you, that you don&#39;t lose all sex appeal just because you&#39;re studying engineering.Quite on the contrary in fact

I facepalmed at the first ad ‍️
What blows my mind is how Felix didn&#39;t even recognize the movie &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; lmao

I face palmed when pewds said 300 thousand k 

<a href="">6:02</a> even worse that their lowest measurement is an inch before you’re forced to use divisions

Do you still read comments Felix?

<a href="">7:52</a> Something similar actually happened in Hong Kong. A man had a heart attack and was sent to the hospital by his son and help was asked immediately after arrival but the staff told him to call an ambulance instead because it was ER&#39;s job. A doctor walked by and offered his help but the man eventually didn&#39;t make it and the court said his death was natural 

this video provides some great examples of why I can&#39;t stand these supposedly &quot;funny&quot; subreddits. There&#39;s just an incredible amount of toxic and arrogant people, mainly leftists, who want to shame and mock those they disagree with while failing to see the holes in their own assertions

<a href="">0:01</a> like completely who is kuru

Pewds in here from the future..... your comments about vaccination did not age well.....

<a href="">4:58</a> in fact, no, vaccnation dont prevent you to get an infection, vaccines help you to fight the infection more effectively.

67

<a href="">0:01</a> Felix is in a mood to facepalm hahahahahahaha

<a href="">0:00</a> hahahahahaha

Hey Pewds, if you were to ban social media… well you realize you’re one of the top YouTubers in the world… right?

<a href="">10:14</a> it&#39;s 67

<a href="">0:43</a> IMO that take aged incredibly well, given that we&#39;d be done with Covid if every adult (without valid medical exemptions) had gotten the vax.

If you think about it, our kids having it easier isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing. Good times produce weak men and weak men produce bad times

When u notice at <a href="">00:00</a> KuruHS at the background

mans doesn’t know the breakfast club… honestly good on him

Dear Felix, You are a Millenial too.

<a href="">11:24</a> 300,000 k 
Does anybody saw KuruHS in the background at <a href="">0:00</a>?

<a href="">2:30</a> Creakfast Blub

<a href="">7:37</a> hes not black tho

Watching from 2021 and being like !! Whenever &quot;vaccine&quot; is mentioned.

CNN just shitposts

<a href="">13:52</a> i think that is my country drama series 

PPL : paint houses white so it doesn&#39;t absorb heatCNN : houses are racist

We live in a society

<a href="">1:44</a> me a white Argentinian: so I can&#39;t speak Spanish now 

<a href="">4:12</a>  Not that anyone will see this nor care 2+ years after the videos been released, but the reason they use white plastic over black plastic is simple. Black Plastics are more fragile than white plastics and are less flexible than white plastics.Need proof.. grab stuff around your OWN home, Black plastic and white plastic. Bend it and see how much pressure it takes to break.Heat up a needle and poke it too. The white plastic stuff takes more punishment than the black plastic does.SCIENCE!~!!!!

I&#39;m a zoomer
Pewds: I don’t know what movie this isPeople over thirty in the comments: <b>unsubscibe</b>

Pewds. ...... you are a millenal

<a href="">7:25</a> couldn&#39;t agreed more

Felix does know he’s a millennial, right?

<a href="">4:19</a> That was donation, idc. If u post it online before you use it, you have officially donated it

To anyone reading this Jesus Christ loves you have a blessed day️️

Lol

Hey pewdiepie Jesus loves you and died for your sins  over 500 eye witnesses saw Jesus rise from the dead, and they were killed for saying its true.. God bless you!

He literally described cultural appropriation

breakfast club.

The cultural appropriation takes gotten a bit old..

i facepalmed your arse 
<a href="">0:42</a> me during the entirety of 2021 be like:

20 people got infected ? Haha cute
Felix Kjellberg: "3o0.0o0 tHoUsAnd k"
0.59% and that&#39;s me

<a href="">6:31</a> really got me X&#39;D

That movie is the Breakfast club.

Good to know that it&#39;s illegal to feed your dog or cat on a vegetarian diet in the uk

The security number money thing literally made my mouth drop

Some people should not be allowed to have dogs or children or living beings in general

<a href="">1:25</a> Ok watch Naruto shippuden bit☆h.
I like how Pewds comments on how he hates Atheists calling out religious people when he just read a post about the exact opposite.

Pewds caused forced vaccination.

China is basically a country that downgrades everything when given to them

lmfao whos watching this in 2021?

<a href="">1:44</a> Well, guess that actually I’m black because I’m spanish.

How are there no comments telling pewds to watch the breakfast club?

How do u not know the breakfast club

God how i hate fucking ads

The mustard is right tho. 50% of 12 is 6 and 6+12 is 18. So 18 oz

man 50% more they calculate the increase from the lower price + 12+6 18, im not even joking its the truth

Jobs: &quot;atleast 3 years experience requirement&quot;Collegue graduates: Ok I guess I&#39;ll go hobo now.

ITS THE BREAKFAST CLUB

I think the same about CA, its dumb.

Cant understand why people gets offended when they get called black people  whats with white and black people, doesnt make any sense to me and it makes me sad that people made riot because of that&quot;Yo you black&quot;&quot;Huh? I&#39;m black? you&#39;re making me angry! &quot;DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE PEOPLEWAKE UP PPPPPPLEASEE

PEWDIEPIE PRESIDENT 2024

Doing math during a flight. Seems like, It happens on plane crashing sence in Vagabond (Korean Series).

I&#39;ve deffo seen that Thomas Sanders tweet on more than one of your videos Pewds 

Egypt is ones of the poorest countrys and any product related to entertainment  is literally 100% or more the price in other countries and the Egyptian president claimed that he took those very high taxes so he encourages the Egyptian industry. A PS5 is 1140 us dollars every single phone or tv or PC is at least 2x the normal price.

Finally PewDiePie is calling out the atheist who spread their cringe everywhere 

English is my 1st language for ref. I for the life of me couldnt remember &quot;a slice of cheese&quot; when i was talking to my bfSo i just kept saying &quot;sheet cheese&quot;

Eyyy kuru hs is here

the point is  pewds doesn&#39;t need this type of captions to make us desperate to click on the vid. coz Its pewds!

Hey guys, Kuru here!
5：22 You need a job to have work-Pewdiepie

i’ve watched pewds for a while but i do hate the fact he uses terms like “retarded”

bleeping the f word but not the r slur is so silly

As a spanish i can say:Soy blanco

<a href="">1:33</a> Felix, this is specifically a christian calling out an athiest. This is literally the opposite of what you&#39;re talking about.

<a href="">11:38</a> whoever posted this is as stupid as the other ppl that got posted about  because 50%, or half, of 12 is 6, so 50% more, or half of it plus itself,  which is 6, + 12, equals 18, so yes, 18 is indeed 50% more then 12. Unless I&#39;m stupid, which is highly likely

the biggest facepalm for me was when he didn&#39;t know what the breakfast club was

Bruh my password hint is you got this bro you got this AND I FORGOT MY PASSWORD

Can I say something which has no sense with the vedio?

That girl that wrote on her mask is just tryin to get high off the sharpie fumes lol

I forgor

Now I get what it means! Reddit/woosh!I still don’t get it.

<a href="">11:23</a> “300,000k”

When ur name is Pewdiepie and u realize that 99.41 + 0.69 isnt 100. Lmao

in short Americans do not understand any measurement, where anywhere is anywhere, and numbers

100,000k

If my social security number was the amount of money I have I would have 424,25,640 dollars

i think humanity had always been this dumb as an unfortunately necessary constant from which the mistakes of idiots and intelligent people alike serve as lessons from which we learn from and grow as a species; I think it just seems like the increase of stupidity nowadays due to the increase of population worldwide giving the illusion of an increase in stupidity because more people = more stupid mistakes.

The movie is called breakfast club, I think it’s a great movie

<a href="">2:35</a> Because anything goes in Florida

I dont wanna b that person but cultural appropriation is when you make money off of other ppls culture. Not when you consume it. So its acually an important subject but ya kno cringe ppl of tumblr want to ruin shit for ppl.

Flat earth society: MARS ISN&#39;T REALAlso flat earth society: Mars has been observed to be round.

still think govt needs to force vax everyone??

The one with the mustard isn’t suppose to be there i made the calcul 12oz + 50% = 18oz this is basic math shit

Mmmmmm

That burger didn’t fail because Americans didn’t know 1/3 was bigger than 1/4x the burger failed because A&amp;W makes worse food than MCDs lol

Watching this in 2021 after worldwide pandemic and facepalming all the antivaxers

sister is 67 not 35. I&#39;m big brain

The first minute of the video is pretty creepy tbh<a href="">2:52</a> too<a href="">4:52</a>

I actually prefer black robots, I think they look more bad ass. So CNN can shove their statistics up their ass.

&quot;Atheist&#39;s need to take their fedoras and eat it&quot; I&#39;m a Christian who LOVES fedoras so I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to do here.

<a href="">4:07</a> I feel like if everyone started making black robots the news would just say that it’s racism because of black slave robots or some bs

ppl  need to realize, if they get offended, Nothing happens. lets say i get offended. after that i carry on with my life. im not responsible for others. i am responsible for how i react to what is coming to me. im not a kid anymore to play the blaming game.

BASED PEWDIEPIE

Take your fedora! Epic hahahaha

At the time I didn&#39;t get why all of a sudden there was this anti-vax stuff. Now I&#39;m pretty sure the anti-vax surge that cropped up was to establish a certain narrative for Covid-19 vaccinations.

Sorry to break it to you but vaccinated people can still spread the disease and can still get it too. It&#39;s not some magic serum that makes you immune to covid lmao

as a 63 year old I can tell you that, from my experience, Yes, people have always been this dumb .They just weren&#39;t so proud of it.

I just got a T-series ad

I&#39;m 13 and even I know how to use a rotary phone and hand book. My parents taught me just in case I need to use them.

You do know the answer is 67 right

Atheist&#39;s are <i>so</i> against religion because, Theist&#39;s demand their believes become <i>our</i> laws! Followed by their faith be taught in <i>our</i> public schools to ALL children! These people want science classes that teach evolution is NOT a fact. Also, that the dinosaurs aren&#39;t real. They aren&#39;t simple &quot;believers&quot;. They&#39;re demand we ALL follow their brainwashed ways! Currently they&#39;re abolishing all abortions. That&#39;s not even in their Bible. They made that part up completely on their own.

<a href="">8:20</a> ir course I would choose the second left

I never knew about poopdie
Vaccine can nvr cause autism

is there a psychological effect where if one person has to do something and it&#39;s difficult, they will hold hate towards everyone else who does the same thing but easier?I suffer, you suffer?and can it be remedied? cause we ain&#39;t gonna progress if so.

<a href="">2:25</a> You haven&#39;t seen Breakfast Club?? It&#39;s an 80&#39;s classic; You should totally check it out :)

There is a whooping cough vaccine, it&#39;s recommended between 16-32 weeks during pregnancy. There is a flu vaccine at least here in the UK every year, they are given to vulnerable groups and first line workers. They pick the most prevalent strain of flu for that year. So that is why we receive a new one yearly.

<a href="">11:20</a> felix once said “300 thousand K”

Pewdiepie is not real. He is a simulation

Pewds doesn&#39;t know The Breakfast Club

I&#39;m a vegan, but I&#39;m not like all those other vegans that hate you for what you eat, I&#39;m cool like that

How can pewds not know the &quot;breakfast club&quot;. I am 15 and I know this movie...

The economist was 100% brown, if he was white that Karen would&#39;ve never reported him.

Back in the day we called cultural appropriation cultural diffusion. It was a good thing that helped us share ideas and cultures

Yes, most people have always been this dumb. The difference is that, now, these dumb people are being praised as “brave” for expressing their stupid feelings. They used to be told how dumb they were every time they spoke and they were eventually conditioned to shut up.

<a href="">2:23</a> no pewds you are a millennial

Three hundred thousand K

Still crying from Pewdiepie not knowing The Breakfast Club

to be fair, if you&#39;re a moron, math is terrorism. and that washington post article about caviar wasn&#39;t making a judgement call, it was just reporting the news and how it effects different economic sectors. cuz it wasn&#39;t an editorial. whomever made the meme didn&#39;t read the article and doesn&#39;t understand how newspapers work. so...face palm?

<a href="">11:55</a> I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m wrong but 50% = 1/2 so really it should be 6 oz but I see what French&#39;s is saying. But basically I&#39;m saying depending on your point of view it should either be 50% or 150%

Before you pull the racism card at least do a easy Google. &quot;Since a black surface absorbs almost all of incident radiation in the solar spectrum and reflects very little of that which is incident, it heats up very fast compared to an opaque white surface, which reflects much more of incident solar radiation than a black opaque surface.&quot;  -Google

He doesn&#39;t know the breakfast club!!!

Pewdiepies reaction to a Christian trying to prove Atheists wrong is to say Atheists need to stop trying to prove Christians wrong? Wtf?

As an Engineer, I can confirm the profession is sexless.

I mean that’s whole atheist against Christians thing makes no sense like respect others religion Christens go online and say random shit like that and then atheist respons like don’t target people then expect respect

i study engineering qnd i can confirm :(

<a href="">1:24</a> There is a well documented video of Ric Ocasek walking on water.

Its not like ppl die from measels

me, drinking a mango avocado smoothie when the &#39;avocado ice-cream&#39; thing came on: interesting

The thing on the guy’s nose measures oxygen level in the body in % form. It goes onto an index finger. 

i wish to get that percentile in jee

That vaccinated everyone turned out rwally good huh ?

<a href="">0:44</a> is where he Predicted the future

You have to admit, smart people usually write terribly, like doctors, so i can imagine it looking like Arabic or such.

Yes, people have always been this dumb, but now we have more platforms for people to make asses of themselves. Thank you internet 

SCISSORS HAIR REMOVAL BYYEEE
Make sure felix dosent become the president.

&quot;3 hundred thousand k&quot;

&quot;MY CODE DOES NETWORK&quot;

Bro the sister is 67. He thought the answer was 35 too. Pfft

I&#39;ve never agreed with a video more in my life

Flu vaccines aren’t a thing in Europe cuz you have a shitty, socialized healthcare. Socialism is bullshit. Accept that it sucks. It’s a fact.

My small brain actually thought that the avocado was mango. Am I really that blind or just stupid

PewDiePie: if I become president I will ban social mediaAlso PewDiePie: REDDIT VIDEOS

<a href="">1:35</a> was literally the religious person calling out atheists first lmao what are you talking about

scissor hair remove....al.....plz

What&#39;s better than reading Reddit posts? Watching a video about Reddit posts. This is way funnier than it would never been of I was reading those posts myself

If I am

Pwds:child dumMe:I know how to use a rotary phone and a remote

<a href="">7:50</a> omg this  and Pewds respond 

Being an Engineer means being a nerd and being a nerd means no sex ever. ever. EVER.

Light mode??

The one about the Berlin Wall was stupid, they never said the wall was GOOD they just said it worked which  it did indeed work.

CNN is gay

The Apple Stand is not a luxury product lol

<a href="">4:22</a> : this is why aliens won’t come to earthEdit : this is also why alien won’t come to earth <a href="">5:55</a>Edit 2 : this is yet another reason why aliens won’t come to earth <a href="">13:44</a>

Did y’all know the pope has walls all around the Vatican. And that people live in gated communities for a reason, walls do work, that is just an absolute shit example, well now that I think about it the Berlin Wall did serve it’s intended purpose of keeping people in to starve to death from a communist regime... so in a way yea it really did work.

Cringing now. If you didn&#39;t want today&#39;s kids to have it easier people, stop inventing stuff!

I just hit like just for your take on &quot;cultural appropriation.&quot; I still believe imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. A Cherokee owned company manufactured toy tomahawks just so Atlanta Braves fans could do the &quot;tomahawk chop&quot;. They took that appropriation as a compliment.

ive seen some people freak out by just pointing at them and saying bee works even better if you say spider or point at the ground and say snake

<a href="">10:17</a>Is a trick question, her younger sister is actually 3 when she was 6 so if you remove 6 from 70 you will get 64 then add the little sisters age then her age will be now 67, so her older sisters age is 70 while she&#39;s 67

this vax oriented vid is so hurtfull in 2021.

The human race is dumber than a monkey

theory: you are living in a simulation and these people are created to make you feel better about yourself and reduce chance of self destruct

im pretty sure you can make an apple pro stand for 1/10 the price

<a href="">0:39</a> Ig 2020 was the year of facepalm

Fyi, it&#39;s not the atheist that does that 

<a href="">7:20</a> the 1st two people couldn&#39;t even write numbers correctly.

Poggers God

little did we know
<a href="">1:30</a> I’m not even that religious but thank you 

The math in plane one is insanely funny

<a href="">06:40</a> Well, foreign math could be mistaken for a suicide note?

most successful engineers unironically dont have time for sex

<a href="">01:52</a> If white people didn&#39;t speak Spanish, we couldn&#39;t hire the million people who sneak into America each year...duh.

Alright, then go out in public with a Swastika and let&#39;s see people&#39;s reaction right now vs 200 years Earlier... Cultural Appropriation is a thing and is the worst thing to exist...

i mean let&#39;s face it, kids these days can get pretty damn dumb, need proof, when my dad was a kid, the owners manual for his car gave instructions on how to perform routine maintenance on the car, owners manuals these days tell you not to drink the battery fluid

Felix be carful with the R slur!!! <a href="">4:09</a>

I was facepalming before I even saw the thumbnail

&quot;When I become president, I&#39;m going to ban all social media.&quot;We hero we don&#39;t need but deserve.

<a href="">6:31</a> U.S. War on Terrorism in a nutshell.

We really going to skip over the fact that pewds hasn&#39;t watched the breakfast club??!!!????!!!!!!!

Little did we know, but pewds is actually the president of Nigeria

That one guy I don’t have hands so how do I facepalm

Look at the word God what it actually stands for is group of drunks and God spelled backwards is dog.

<a href="">8:02</a> I’m pretty sure the author doesn’t choose that, its the publishing company. I could be wrong

For every boomer that hates a millenial, there is a generation in hetween that hates you both.&quot;OMG THAT&#39;S ME!&quot; No Felix, you are not a Generation X&#39;er, you are a millenial too 

Felix, if you’re listening,Scroll PAST the fake ass flat eatheners.After Google Page 1, you might find some genuine people warning you that nasa is absolutely full of shit.  China and Russia, too.  Watch the footage with an expert, and let them point out the OBVIOUS inconsistencies hidden in plain sight.  You don’t know if it’s flat or round, or if there are portals at the North Pole. It’s definitely not what they told us.

Love from Nigeria

In us flu vax r voluntary, vaccinations much different diseases, covid, polio, meningitis, all schools require vaccines and many jobs w physicals request vaccines, many too young remember getting his vaccines and no knowledge what colleges, high schools, health care jobs, these amd others will require. No vax polio no job, no vax covid19 no job

That thing on his nose is to check his blood oxygen levels...

There’s a difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation

Me face palming at three hundred thousand k

“Have people always been this dumb?”Yes, 100%. We once thought the Earth was flat and that the sun revolves around us, that left-handed people were infested by the Devil, and that draining liters of blood would cure illness. We have always collectively been fucking morons, the internet just puts it front and center for people to share.

<a href="">1:43</a> I just realised that one of the tumblr default avatars looks completely like the youtube profile I made myself wth

Bout to face palmRealize it’s COVID 

Take your fedora and eat it!Light: I&#39;m gonna take this potato chip and... EAT IT!

I never know quite how to respond when people reveal they lack what I view as general knowledge. I had one co-worker ask me how it was still winter when she was in England for new years and so I had to explain how the equator works and that we&#39;re on the same half of the world as England. Another one didn&#39;t know what a mule was and I found that utterly baffling. She&#39;s a teacher in a rural area, how you not know this???

Mcdonalds already make 1/10 burgers

Did anyone else see the 69420 in the title

I am younger and know how to use a rotary phone bc I used to watched old movies and I think it would be more fun to use instead of doing a tippy-tap on a smartphone’s screen

<a href="">13:20</a> That’s everything you need to know about American press

<a href="">5:37</a> ...i think mr bezos has enough money to handle his own fires

<a href="">1:44</a> ironically, that&#39;s racist, obviously there are white people in LATAM.

I can walk on water. I&#39;ve seen other people do it too. I once saw an entire ice hockey game played on water.

Reddit is just &#39;conservative bad&#39;, it&#39;s so garbage.

&quot;have people always been this dumb?&quot;yes. we&#39;ve always been this way.

I mean the abortion one is right. Buuuut the guy that answered is also right xD

<a href="">0:30</a> well.... that aged well !!

Didn&#39;t the Berlin Wall work?

i didnt face palm once because i wasnt paying any attention to this video

<a href="">9:18</a>CAN THIS BOOMERS USE INTERNET?! HMM??

<a href="">0:00</a> KuruHS spotted
His sister was half his age when he was 6. Now he’s 70. How old is she6/2=3     70-3=67    NOT 70/2= 35

How have you never see The Breakfast Club?? You should watch it ASAP!! It’s a classic

Sorry for being Spanish pewds, it won&#39;t happen again 

Cant believe pewds blanked on the &quot;my sister was half my age&quot; riddle 

Caviar isn&#39;t even a luxury good, its just shit.

9.12.19 &quot;i don&#39;t think you need to be vacced....&quot;THAT DID NOT AGE WELL

<a href="">2:26</a> The Breakfast club

I have no beliefs

dude my password hints are exactly that. im such an ass

Felix: Spain, stop it!Que the follen, giri

Cancel felix he said retarded

10 million views

i won the challenge cos i dont have hands to facepalm

<a href="">0:31</a> aha... good times...

flu vaccines feels like a moneygrab once a year lol

Big brain Felix with the 35

If you don’t want kid don’t do pp  dance
<a href="">9:13</a> pewdiepie should have said &quot;It&#39;s so wonderful to see the generations getting excited about the advancement of reatrdateion in human self esteem nd progress of technology&quot;

<a href="">3:13</a> we also have another noise it souds like this<b>loud screaming and buzzing</b>

I never actually facepalmed for real but god have I never wanted to facepalm any more in my life than in this video

Yooooo love Felix dropping the r word like it nuthin&#39;

<a href="">11:23</a> apparently they made 300 million

I’m a Spaniard and I look like an albino.

Pewdiepie is small brain. When they were 6 they were half the age... So they are 67

You don&#39;t have to have a vaccine for the flu however people who are more likely to affected by it are offered it. My brother (who has asthma) gets offered it every year to help protect him from it.

The whole walk on water argument is so stupid. Why can&#39;t we walk on water? Well that&#39;s not really a good argument cause if we don&#39;t believe in god, then we don&#39;t think ANYONE can walk on water, other then that one type of lizard.

<a href="">1:00</a> lmao the berlin wall worked perfectly for over 20 years.

It’s almost as if cultural appropriation and appreciation are different things

Like... obviously &quot;walls work&quot; lol, thats why we build them... Your house has exterior walls right? It&#39;s a super basic idea, I dont understand people questioning it because someone they don&#39;t like came up with a plan to build one...

<a href="">1:00</a> but pewds... the Berlin wall did work... families were separated for decades... It actually worked really, really well unfortunately

<b>69420</b>

I like how Pewdiepie complains about Atheists calling out religious people on a thread started by a religious person calling out Atheists. Cool bias m8.

It is always good to remind yourself that the answer to the question:&quot; are humans that stupid?&quot; Is always, always! YES

&quot;ath dumb&quot; <a href="">7:48</a> FELIX??? ARE U BUYINH CRYPTO????? NICE
Walls work, thats a fact

Felix‘s eyes are so beautiful. Thought that just had to be said

300 thousand K .... lmao

Woah what an anti vax prediction

Hey I know this video is over a year old and that nobody&#39;s gonna see this comment, but if pewdiepie ran for president and promised the removal of social media, I&#39;d vote, and I&#39;m very curious as to see who&#39;s with me and for that same reason.

Here in Australia we have a influenza/flu issues so we have to get vaccinated because a lot of people die from it in this country.Edit: I’m not sure how it is in other countries however, but it gets really bad here.

So Pewds has NO idea what The Breakfast Club is??? Way to make miss Molly Ringwald sad.....

Omg the vaccination and chip comments he made...

We’re pretty much the smartest dumbest animals on earth

Bruh I know how to use a rotary phone when I was 10

I have never gotten the flu vaccine and I have never had the flu and I rarely ever get sick

So... the 300k avocado illegal selling is a real thing. People are being murdered in Mexico for decades because of the interest from the cartels on avocado market.

Im cristian ty for defending us

<a href="">10:55</a> They exist because their parents didn&#39;t teach them correctly. I used to be the same exact way getting triggered by the most minute things but then I grew up and realised how stupid and needlessly toxic I was. Some never learn though.

When you watch this in 2021 and realize elon does wanna put chips in peoples heads no not through a vaccine and there&#39;s other dumb people afraid of nano bots in the covid vaccine pewds predicted the future confimed

This kid once sed Can u see god? No? So god isn&#39;t realSo I sedCan u see ur brain?no?so ur brain isn&#39;t real And he just walked away

Handicaps without hand be like

Calm down with the fucking hate on antivaxers. If the debate between Christianity and atheists is cring, this definitely is too. Just let people believe what they want

<a href="">0:41</a> this did not age well

<a href="">1:38</a> at least we don’t bomb you if you don’t believe in our religion. 

lol

this would be the perfect video for pewds to get rick rolled

I’m part of the .69% who didn’t face palm. <b>nice.</b>

<a href="">3:12</a> “why don’t humans have a specific noise that means there are bees here let’s leave immediately”We do it sounds like this: FRRIIIICK BEES!!! RUN!!!

Surprised pewds just casually says government should just vaccinate everyone like sure even if it’s the cure for death you shouldn’t make people do anything man don’t be spreading bad messages to your young viewers

<a href="">0:43</a> .... <b>nervous laughter</b>

<a href="">7:38</a> Zack Snyder stole the line from Felix

who else is in pain that Felix was in light mode the entire fime

Cultural appropriation is different then cultural appreciation it’s culture appropriation if you are doing some thing or wearing something associated with a culture disrespectfully and taking it as a joke or a costume or whatever and culture appreciation is wearing or doing some thing from another culture with respect and knowing how to do it right

<a href="">2:30</a> HE DOESNT KNOW BREAKFAST CLUB!!!???

Black robots are way cooler looking than white robots

1/10 pound burger already exist pewd...
<a href="">10:14</a> the fact that Pewds didn’t get it makes it even more funny.

“Atheists calling out religions is so cringe”But it was the religious person calling out atheism?

The math thing on the flight killed me 

<a href="">11:17</a> okuyasu hair cut
Pewds: I don&#39;t know what movie this is    almost 10 mil people who watched this :  <b>facepalms</b>

<a href="">13:51</a> that&#39;s an oximeter which they thought measures oxygen from the nose 

T bo

300 thousand K

How have these people survived this long

<a href="">1:53</a> finally someone said this

<a href="">0:29</a> hits differently now

That 50%  more mustard bottle was actually right! 50% more of 12 oz = 18 oz because half of 12 is 6

<a href="">2:52</a> The flu vaccine is pointless. It guarantees you get sick whereas if you don&#39;t get it, there&#39;s a high chance you don&#39;t. Imagine being able to make an individual decision based on the facts that matter to you. It&#39;s almost like you are able to think for yourself and don&#39;t have to be pressured by people who mean nothing to you. They want to think their life matters when in reality it doesn&#39;t. Its funny because the system feeds off of that. Why do you think there are so many ads saying &quot;masks save lives&quot; when in reality it does nothing but reduce your oxygen intake. Weak minded people who had shitty parents ,that gave them participation trophies, see that shit and eat it up. Then when they see someone without a mask on, they are angry because we don&#39;t give it the same meaning they do. Their life is meaningless. Your life is meaningless. My life is meaningless. When you are dead guess what happens to the world. Nothing. <b>ANYTHING YOU ACCOMPLISH IN YOUR LIFE WILL NOT MATTER 100 YEARS FROM NOW, NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE GET TOGETHER AND YELL A CERTAIN MARXIST SLOGAN</b>

this video can be summed up with one word: America

“ This is where the government needs to just step in and vaccinate everyone “ jokes that aged very well.

Well abortion can cause permenant damage to young body&#39;s and can actually be very unsafe depending on how far long the pregnancy is.

Mathematician <b>writes in scribbly</b>Woman passenger: looks aye-rab to me

<a href="">6:48</a> Also, even if it was actually a different language, why would that mean terrorismThey could be writing to anyone about literally anything

The math thing in the flight was almost sure  a Karen that got scared , a becky that was paranoid or a Chad on the hunt

That one guy without arms :)

I mean, if you take it off the equation natural selection, then yes, we are getting more stupid.

<a href="">10:14</a> pewds made me face palm XD
<a href="">1:33</a> THAT WAS A FUCKING RELIGIOUS PERSON CALLING OUT AN ATHEIST

<a href="">0:35</a> aged like milk

U seriously said three hundred thousand K ‍️

Pewds: What are they gonna do next put chip in our headsHe predicted the future

Engineers have been waiting for sex anyway lol

The avocado thing is actually big time criminal job. No joke Mexican gangs will grow a shit load of avocados and make serious bank off of selling them in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas

God this video reminds me why I&#39;m subscribed to pewdiepie

I facepalmed witching the first -30 seconds bc ads

pretty sure that movie is the breakfast club

Pewds has stumbled upon American reddit I guess.

Thats it! REVERT TO A P E

man that second one...

“This is not 1819” Not now but soon

“I can give you a tenth pound burger.” That’s McDonald’s normal burger. Already a thing.

to be fair, I&#39;d also call security if I saw some econ differential equations. Too scary

<a href="">10:14</a> When I was 5, my big brother hadn&#39;t been born yet. Now I&#39;m 25, and my big brother still hasn&#39;t been born.

<a href="">0:29</a> let the natural selection do its best

Felix, it was the Christian reaching out and provoking atheists in the photo you showed while bashing atheists behaving dumb.

When he talked about the measles, it has a new meaning nowadays

The answer is 67 felix their sister is 67. If their sister was 3 when they were 6 then they are 3 years younger. 70-3=67

the beginning of this video did not age well

Lol that was supposed to be 67 the answer not 35

As in an immature shouldn’t get to choose who lives and dies

It&#39;s weird how everyone in the comments is saying that the measles outbreak predicted covid, even though there&#39;s hundreds or even thousands of minor disease outbreaks every year that affect way more than 22 people...

But it&#39;s literally the religious people trying to call out atheists and failing at it in that post, not the other way around. You&#39;re basically complaining about atheists replying to people that literally asked them a question...

Pewdssssss nooooooo!!!!! <a href="">2:30</a> is the Breakfast Club. was an instant classic

I didnt Facepalm. I must be the chosen one.

Am i the stupid one? Why is <a href="">11:40</a> a facepalm? 12*1,5=18... so its 50% more than 12oz and should be correct

<a href="">11:23</a> its 300,000 Or its 300K if you say it 300,000k then it would be 300,000,000.

<a href="">2:20</a>  WHAT  IS  THE  MOVIE

Can you become President so we can stop social media

At <a href="">13:00</a> isn’t that a mango not an avocado

love u dude, but not the r slur in 2020

300k= 300 thousand k, logic?

<b>I own 17 fedoras. I&#39;ve even lost a few.</b>
It&#39;s 22 billion not 22 million (lituraly face palm)

Me seeing background of KuruHS Facepalm.

<a href="">10:18</a> it is 67 

Its really sad i could sell a bottle of shampoo for 100$ and for some reason its more luxurious than that same bottle of shampoo thats 10$

KuruHS facepalm
like we say in Ukraine: <b>they beat on the face, not on the passport</b>
In Canada they make you get flu vaccine if workings in any health area. .

<a href="">0:36</a>   dude what

I despise the fact that he defended the apple pro stand

<a href="">12:21</a> actually cringed

KuruHS made it to Pewdiepie 
<a href="">10:19</a> what happened to using math

The robots are white cause white aborbs less light then all the other colors, so it doesnt overheat. Black obsorbs the most. THERE CNN I JUST USED FUCKING SCIENCE I LEARNED IN FUCKING 3RD GRADE!

<a href="">3:53</a> facts <a href="">7:20</a>

Petition for Felix to watch a Nigerian movie.

“This is where the government just needs to step in and fucking vaccinate everyone” best pre-COVID quote. People complain about masks and not being able to travel, eating out, or go to bars and sporting events. Have the option to get vaccinated to let them do normal things without risking other people’s lives. Refuse to vaccinate. Continue to complain....

Did pewds really say 35 at &quot;when I was 6 my sister was half my age, now I&#39;m 70 how old is my sister?&quot; lmaoooo 

I never slapped my face one

<a href="">0:43</a>...damn he spitting facts about 2021

<a href="">13:20</a> anybody else’s Siri turn on from him saying “saving”? 

For me as a Swede it is so weird to here “does anybody know how to drive a manual?” Or like in the scenario in the video where the manual are so rare that people get uncomfortable with it and don’t understand it’s purpose  in Sweden every car is manual, there are no automatics 

You could say white robots are subconsciously racist. Make more black robots. But robots are made to serve people. So if they are black, that would be racist. Its basically never good.

I guess I&#39;m that 0.49%

I didn’t know remotes had HDMI’s

My favourite one was of the solar farm sucking up the sun dry. That has got to be the best thing I&#39;ve heard in my entire life.

Notice how felix turns more red the longer the video goes on

<a href="">4:00</a> CNN basically with their bullshit again

People are very stupid sometimes

OMG A + WE NEED TO CALL SECURITY

“I don’t know what movie this is.” 

<a href="">1:46</a> amen brother

<a href="">1:29</a> That&#39;s Agnosticism, Pewds.

<a href="">0:31</a> , today hits different.
<a href="">1:40</a> honestly though most of us don&#39;t care until they start forcing it on people, of course we are going to reply at that point, they are pushing beliefs we disagree with

The fact that they didn&#39;t put the numbers in correct positions make the social security one even more sad.

.59% GANG

<a href="">2:52</a> damn, that didn&#39;t age so well right?

It&#39;s dumb not to get the flu vaccine every year, even in Europe ;)

Pewds, i know its late, but dude people don&#39;t get vaccinated for every flu, they vaccinated you for the most likely one you would come across,Sincerely, a nine year old

The engineering one is actually on point 

<a href="">11:23</a>,300 thousand k??

Video hasn&#39;t started yet, but I already have an imprint of my palm on my skull. Title doesn&#39;t lie.

Food for thought: in an alternate reality, robots would be black or yellow and people would be racists again. White robot cleaning the house or helping you put items in the shopping cart is a problem? Stop finding racism where there isn&#39;t any, seriously

22 people infectedkarens: pathetic
I felt my heart break when you said you didn’t know what the breakfast club movie was 

People haven&#39;t always been that dumb. Started in 1776 tho.

<a href="">2:04</a> &quot;you can&#39;t steal culture&quot; Pewdiepie Rome: &quot;Hmm&quot;
Most engineering students are virgins because they&#39;re too busy being stressed lmao

Pewds I hope u watch the breakfast club

Beep boop

pewdiepie i love your content but not knowing what the breakfast club no matter what country your in is a sin(disclaimer this comment is made for laughs and not for being)

We do live in A society
$300kpewdiepie: three hundred thousand k?1?!?

So we’re all gonna focus on the fact he didn’t know what the breakfast club was instead of the fact that he said the r slur?

I gotta admit, I was annoyed when he didn&#39;t notice the &quot;my sister was half my age&quot; joke.

If I ever become president I will ban social media- Pewdiepie, social media influencer

this aged well

“We’re people always this dumb” no, there will always be idiots, but there used to be natural selection

<a href="">9:17</a> I bet most people can use rotary phones, cause ya know it&#39;s a pretty easy design that requires little thinking. It&#39;s just those dumbasses that have no life skills at all that struggle with simple stuff like that.

Cultural appropriation is the dumbest thing ever, especially in the USA or ya know the cultural melting pot

Didnt the religious dude called out the atheist?

Funny enough, the numbers we use are derived from Arabic numerals. So dumb bitch was kinda right in the stupidest way

White robots are racist? What? It’s because plastic is naturally white why spend money to paint a robot that isn’t fully working tf haha

Don’t say the r slur man

If we&#39;re white we can&#39;t speak SpanishI guess spain doesn&#39;t exist now

The fragile door coronally supply because peripheral probably watch between a premium father-in-law. noxious,  fresh repair

If you ever lose faith in humanity just remember the Earth was formed from rocks and water and someone made bluetooth out of that

I got the flu every year for like six years then when i skipped i didn’t get it

im 22 European and i can easily use rotary phone , im pretty sure its American kids that don&#39;t know how to use old technology

I was practicing writing Spanish for my Spanish class and there was a Karen next to me so she said I was writing in some terrorist English but then the security guard spoke Spanish so he yelled at the Karen in Spanish and she went crazy 

Fun Fact: Notice how the 99.41% represents the like to dislike ratio for this video.

<a href="">4:07</a>as a person who is studying media... You are correct. *Make a weird or eyecatching title*Have a photo that shows an example that reflects the title*Clicks, make em click!

You don&#39;t know breakfast club, Felix?

Thos anti-vax ones were already bad, but they did NOT age well

<a href="">2:31</a> ...but it&#39;s a classic

Wow... i never knew t’ill now that there are people dumber than me 

The mustard thing is pretty simple 18 oz.=150% of 12 oz. so theyre actually right

“I share the road with these guys” says the guy who doesn’t change his tires

Like my grandpa says “You can’t fix stupid”
<a href="">4:00</a> bruh their white cuZ white refreclts light

Why must I have been given the unrightfull title of human

<a href="">2:30</a>When Felix doesn’t recognize Breakfast clubr/Facepalm

<a href="">10:15</a>cmon pewds‍️
Lmfao

Next: the screen is white rascist

I think that thomas sanders one was a joke note a facepalm. I mean he sure does make vines

This video just taught me that Pewds is more based than I already thought

From <a href="">3:04</a> to <a href="">3:06</a> News, the horrible pewds is against covid vaccines

My respect when Pewdiepie was shaming the atheistards 

Felix has never watched the Breakfast Club...he was so perfect...

Wearing a Native American war bonnet is cultural appropriation because in their culture that is an honor that has to be earned by their greatest leaders,Wearing a kimono is not cultural appropriation because it’s just clothes ffs

<a href="">11:23</a> Felix says “300,000 K” ‍️
ummmmmmmmmmmm the measles story infecting 22 others................ 2020 PEWDS PREDICTED 2020

Starbucks is owned by the guy who based the theme of Starbucks off of Italy

Wow all the vaccine talk/communicable diseases in this video.... Little did he know...

Felix on cultural appropriation was so close to seeing the point lmao I love him

Pewdiepie 3 monts before corona: &quot;This is where the government needs to step in and just ****ing vaccinate everyone.&quot;

Funny how it&#39;s most religious people calling out atheists tho pewds

<a href="">10:20</a> quik mafs
This video did not age too well, with some jokes lol

<a href="">11:44</a> the label is actually CORRECT here because when they mean 50% more, they mean 50% of the original content was added, so 12oz x 50% = 6oz, 12oz + 6oz = 18oz.Which proves that the label is correct.Edit: He said it later in the video.

<a href="">1:30</a> thank you Pewds

Pewds talking about anivaxxers about a year in advance, this is big pp

<a href="">0:41</a> imagine being in year 2020

Hmm...

<a href="">5:50</a> the worst part is that americans use the fraction system for stuff way more than any other country. and even they dont know how it works.im swedish and i like old american cars and it took me a long time to figure out the system for wrenches. you always have to think about what is bigger like 3/8” or 7/16”.1/4”5/16”3/8”7/16”1/2”9/16” 5/8”13/16”7/8”1”meanwhile in metric land. if a 12mm doesnt work try a 13mm. you dont have to think to know what is bigger or smaller than the one you are holding.7mm8mm9mm10mm11mm12mm13mmand so on XD

Ima make a 2/8 pound burger and sell it at a higher price than mic Donalds

How does pewds not know what the breakfast club is?!

HE NEVER SAW &quot;THE BREAKFAST CLAB&quot; IM GONNA RAGE QUITTTT

That second post didn&#39;t age well

Who came here because of La Guardia Cross channel (New Father Chronicles<a href="">6:18</a>

<a href="">10:15</a> The younger sister was half the age of older sister meaning she was 3 years old. Hence, being 3 years younger than the older sister.Now that the older sister is 70, younger sister will be 3 years younger (70-3=67)Therefore, the younger sister will be 67 and not 35.

antivaxx mothers when their unvaccinated child still gets autism: :O

me after watching these peoples dum questions and dum answers : reject humanity become monke ahoooo

Hi

<a href="">10:17</a> About that his sister is 67 when he is 70. BIG BRAIN TIME. Because if when he was 6 she was 3 then the dif between them is 3 years. So 70-3=67

And they hunt mangodos
<b><i>6 7</i></b>

<a href="">6:32</a>  that person be like: he is writing in Spanish i am concerned about my security

Holy molky is that kuru in the beginning of the video

The funny thing is Al-Gebra isn&#39;t even wrong, the guy who it was named for was Al-Jibri.

the word &quot;retard&quot; shouldn&#39;t be used as an insult, its a literal medical diagnosis that they cannot control. its like calling someone a &quot;fag&quot; which i know that&#39;s a word for a cigarette or something in some places which is okay if you use it in that context but when you use it to insult someone its not okay. being gay is something people cannot control or fix. i&#39;m not too pressed about it but i thought id just put this out here lol

<a href="">1:30</a> | no but they saw jesus do it so you do kinda gotta send the vid.

Felix on the Thomas Sanders one says how what thomas done was cringe but on another video he contradicts himself and says that what thomas did was meant to be a joke. This is, like the theme of this video, a face palm

If you believe in god you’re too gullible
<a href="">9:13</a> “Can this 89 Year Old use a IPhone”

Yes 1/4 is totally bigger than 1/3

Pewdiepie: <b>Reads a conversation where a theist is trying to attack atheists</b>Also pewdiepie: &quot;The whole atheist calling out religious people thing is so cringe... take your fedora and eat it&quot;

What if mars was flat BUT SIDEWAYS SO LOOK LIKE SPHERE?!?

<a href="">2:30</a> made me acctualy face palm (its breakfast club felix)

Pewdiepie spitting fax&quot;Kids today have it a lot easier than we did growing up.&quot;&quot;That&#39;s the goal though. Isn&#39;t that the point?&quot;Boomers out here like nah my grandkids need to be in factories at age 8 and fight in wars at age 13 with no opportunity for education in-between.

The selling point for the video is when he actually facepalmed

To be fair.When the wall was standing, it worked pretty well.

Poodeepaaah, te movie at <a href="">2:28</a> is breakfast club
guys look at pewds eyes which ones does he have vote now A hazel b green c ocean blue d teal<a href="">2:09</a>

this is what pewdiepie should look like all the time

&quot;If you&#39;re buying the apple stand then you probably have all these&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, Felix said it.  

The fact that other teens can’t use a rotary phone but I know how to because of the one scene with the evil lady from 101 Dalmatians when she used one concerns me

You have to get flu vaccine every year cause the flu mutates meaning every flu is different

Hoohea i baet %99.41 precent
The way he speaks here is the closest I&#39;ve heard him welcoming Sweedish accent.

<a href="">9:47</a> bro your job is based on social media what do you mean

the guy with cocaine under the wig. BIG BRAIN 

300,000k

I love how he doesn’t recognize the breakfast club

Him: 30, not knowing what that movie wasMe: 11, breakfast club?

The one about infecting 22 people at a game has aged very well

Bruv i can use a rotary phone its simple

Did pewds think the answer was actually 35???

Walls are usually white too, it&#39;s not racism, it just looks better and reflects more lights.Robots also look much better when white, and it&#39;s better to check if any fluids are leaking from it for example.

<a href="">0:30</a> little did he know
<a href="">11:19</a><a href="">12:56</a>

<a href="">10:15</a> no, the sister is 67 if you were 6 and she was 3 that would mean when you are 15 she is 12 and so on and so on your sister is 3 years younger than you it doesn’t stay half

<a href="">13:56</a> isn’t that a Malaysian channel? Omg im so embarrassed 

You got wooshed with 70yo joke

<a href="">11:58</a> I dead ass thought our lord and savior was being dumb but then I realized I was the dumb one

<a href="">7:00</a> What are the numbers mason!

&quot;When i was six my sister was half my age...&quot; So, 3&quot;Now I&#39;m 70. How old is my sister?&quot; The sister is 67, not 35. got by you too pood

The measles joke did not age well

<a href="">0:30</a> didn’t age well...
Okay but the engineering thing is true though

Pewds the movie is the breakfast club and I recommend it 8/10

Y’all remember when cultural appropriation=bad ;was a thing?  Those were simpler times. Really stupid but simpler times

Glad to be in the .73%

Walls do indeed work. USA needs to keep out the crap of the world out in the world, not in USA. Coming from a Mexican perspective, therefore, I can&#39;t be racist.

Felix not knowing breakfast clubMe: ‍️
Wait..... Whats KURU doing here LMAO

I have a lot of opinions on a lot of subjects and I feel like Felix would be the best person to have these discussions with and I’d love to debate with him on topics he just gets it

Bruh him not knowing that movie made me face palm

When i was 6 my sister was half my age (3 years old, 3 years younger). Now I am 70. So the sister should be 67 (still 3 years younger) not 35.

<a href="">0:34</a> Well that...aged well....

<a href="">3:01</a> Coronavirus be like “guess what Pewds”

If you just say the curse words instead, it&#39;s way better than that fart noise

<a href="">0:30</a> that did not age well....

<a href="">1:37</a>

<a href="">2:29</a>  .. pewds doesn&#39;t know what The Breakfast Club is, i&#39;ve lost all faith in humanity

<a href="">10:55</a> I think they&#39;re inbred...

Pewds : <a href="">9:28</a> : kids very dumbalso pewds : 9 yr old army Conclusion : Pewds fanbase dumb

300 thousand k

Ik this is late but I just want to clarify for the Thomas Sanders post if you call the store for a delivery the employees can add delivery instructions themselves in most cases

Ok.... There r 420k likes,,, that&#39;s the bruh number

To be fair, the Berlin Wall worked for some time

All the people who made the likes 420k they are pro gamers

I beat the ender dragon 10 minutes after watching this

300 thousand k what

My god
Hit like if u didn&#39;t facepalm nit even once
For the one curious person. The movie is called Breakfast Club

I&#39;m from Spain and can&#39;t speak spanish

<a href="">3:18</a> PFFTTTTTT!!!

<a href="">13:52</a>, fyi guys, the so called &#39;soap opera&#39; was broadcasted from a Malaysian satellite channel known as Astro Warna, which primarily broadcast comedic shows and some related stuff. I wouldn&#39;t be surpised to see such stupid stuff though

That literally made me double face palmed. White robots being racist? Damn the democrats are not playing around. It really sucks to be in the middle over here.

That infection joke  did not age well...

that vaccine quote didnt age well

<a href="">10:20</a>That hurt my brain to read

<a href="">2:29</a> I actually spat my drink in shock

I will answer about the codes Felix they long because THEY STUPID!!!!!!!

I still got hooping cough even after a vaccine.Aparently they don&#39;t last forever 

If God&#39;s not real then why do meteors always land in the center of craters?

<a href="">2:59</a> they predicted Corona masks??? WHAT

<a href="">4:27</a> that&#39;s what she said

<a href="">5:45</a> this would’ve worked anywhere but USA...

I died when he didn&#39;t know breakfast club

<a href="">0:45</a> didn&#39;t age well. Welcome to 2021 

Pewds, there is a difference between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation. But I get what you’re saying. 

<a href="">0:29</a> yo this is some foresight 20/20 shit

[20] A non-volatile compound Z, used to make two solutions that
different. Solution A contains 5 g of compound Z dissolved in 100 g of water.
Meanwhile, solution B contains 2.31 g of compound Z dissolved in 100 g
benzene. Solution A has a vapor pressure of 754.5 mmHg at the normal boiling point of water
and solution B has the same vapor pressure at the normal boiling point of benzene.
Calculate the molar mass of compound Z in solutions A and B!
If people didn’t go to university and got a real job instead of a degree in “gender studies”, philosophy, and art culture they wouldn’t be so dumb

PewDpie: says kids are dumb Actual nine-year-old in nine-year-old army: 

tbh this is just ppl suffering while getting embarrassing and being ridiculous or stupid

<a href="">0:43</a> lmao

Are we gonna ignore that he hasn’t seen breakfast club?

Aaaaaaaagghhh
I men. Well this is my problem. Not you problem. I am from  turkhish men. See you later

Hmm yes KuruHS <a href="">0:01</a>
<a href="">0:29</a> imagine if we&#39;d have had a measles pandemic from that instead lmao

Dog in <a href="">3:42</a> : I have suffered enough from this lady.

<a href="">6:17</a> i think the whole point of it is they whine more than ANY GENERATION EVER about how hard they have it.....THAT&#39;S the facepalm.

<a href="">1:41</a>  just a reminder for me

<a href="">0:35</a> <a href="">2:24</a> <a href="">3:27</a> <a href="">4:59</a> <a href="">6:00</a> <a href="">6:41</a> <a href="">7:18</a> <a href="">7:39</a> <a href="">8:34</a> <a href="">8:46</a> <a href="">12:54</a> <a href="">13:46</a>

Pewds: Kids are stupid30% of his subscribers: seriously

Why did he say 300,000k

<a href="">2:30</a>  I want to say The Breakfast Club. I&#39;ve never seen it, but it&#39;s just a guess.

I was eating during the food appointment one, I nearly choked

1 year later but if you didnt know the science explanation of jesus walking on water is that in those times the water in that sea was full of salt so normal people could walk on it and im pretty sure that you can still but i dont remember where it was ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Not Pewds saying the r slur.....

The next face palm refit post should be Felix not knowing what breakfast club is

I&#39;m guessing pewdiepie is agnostic. a religious group that doesn&#39;t believe in God but isn&#39;t atheist. While agnostics don&#39;t know what to believe most of them respect everyone&#39;s beliefs, but some agnostics would consider atheism being stupid nonsense since whole porpoise of atheism is about not being in a religion and not believing anything. For example some agnostics think celebrating atheism which is celebrating not believing is like celebrating something that they don&#39;t do, it&#39;s kinda like saying that you are in a group of non-golfers or non-gamers and you are somehow different in that and are deserved to have different treatment. I am myself somewhat agnostic but have gorwn up in Christianity so I don&#39;t really know if I should be Christian or agnostic, so I consider myself being both. I still respect each religion. I don&#39;t mind if someone makes fun of Christianity or any other religion as long as I find it somewhat funny, but seeing atheists trying to tell the &quot;truth&quot; to people is cringe af. So next time you call someone childish for believing whatever God they believe, you should know your fucking place, trash!

Pewds: We live in a societyMe: Yes... Yes we do...

I like how the Merch is suka blyatt

<a href="">2:58</a>Unfortunately, I’m allergic to the flu vaccine so I can’t get it (it literally just gives me the flu), but I hope to god everyone who can get one is getting one. Also, everyone should be taking the COVID vaccine when it’s available (I’m gonna take that one and hope it doesn’t give me COVID lol)

<a href="">00:00</a> kuruKillMe
I used to watch pewdiepie all the time when I was younger but now I find myself going back to his channel during quarantine.

Pewds: Don&#39;t get me wrong, kids are dumb.Also Pewds: <a href="">10:14</a>

Thank you pewds people are killing and abusing and domestic violence and they get like 2 years AND JOE EXOTIC gets 25+ years for nothing as bad and not to mention Carol basking doing the same thing POLICE OPEN YOU EYES 

Bro EXACTLY. Culture deserves to be spread and appreciated by other people. Otherwise, cultures die out.

ngl this video is kinda problematic

<a href="">10:16</a>She actually 64 years old pewds

He need to watch the breakfast club smh

At <a href="">13:30</a> pretty much why the separation of class exist.&quot;Otherwise what separates us frome THEM! I grew up with the mindset of being told I&#39;m special&quot;  Separation of roles played in society and general zip code with quotas too meet in each region. Everyone else left over... ???

I&#39;m asian and I agree with everything you said about cultural appropriation. It&#39;s stupid

Born in 1997, and Idk how to use rotary phone

&quot;I just feel like politics is so... at an all time high dumb&quot;Hahah Im sure it gets better in 2020...

im tvelve i now how to use a retory phone

Felix the movie is called the breakfast club watch it it’s good

<a href="">0:30</a> . Feels way too familiar now with Covid denying morons

culture appropriation is just stupid thing that exist for no reason tbh

Holy shit
In South America advocados are huge. They mostly import small under ripe ones for ease of  transport and they still sell for good price per fruit. I would buy black market advocados if the price was right.

When he was talking about the burger I got a Carl’s Jr. 1/3 pound angus burger ad

pewds predicted it <a href="">0:44</a>

<a href="">0:29</a> this one has not aged well...

but u r a millenial felix
<a href="">13:38</a>

<a href="">11:23</a> 300 thousand K?What? Seems like Felix knows some maths unlike us! He doesn&#39;t have 100 million+ subs for no reason, right?

Dude felix 18 is 50% more than 12

<a href="">9:09</a> That aged perfectly 

I AM THE 0.69%Never mind I am not.
You know it goes both ways I feel like you don&#39;t have the right to tell atheist to stop posting about how they don&#39;t believe in God on the internet when Christians do the same thing stop being contradictory. The person who did the post was the one calling them out that&#39;s them posting about their religion the Atheist was just responding

Flying trains? use a plane

Bro that movie is the breakfast club its great and u should defiantly watch

<a href="">3:00</a> &quot;flu vaccines aren&#39;t really a thing here in Europe.&quot; What? In Switzerland it is a thing, every single year.

<a href="">0:30</a> like it happens today with Corona.

My parents are arguing right now

<a href="">10:14</a> pewds is as dumb as that girl and thats immpresive

the solar panels sucking up the sun hurt my head too much

Pewdiepie for president
The biggest facepalm is that pewdiepie hasn’t seen breakfast club

Oof, that measles one just sent ripples across this year

Does that mean uve never been an kid ?

Lmao haha
Felix - &quot;You don&#39;t have to vaccinated for every flu, sounds kinda ridiculous to me.&quot; I live in the U.S. and that&#39;s not how things work around here, we get shots for measles and stuff at birth, and then get 1 flu shot yearly. (Typically, that is)

My brother has atisom man sad kid hours

This hits different in post covid 2020

me who has no hands: ahahah ez

I don’t like Thomas sanders, BUT I work at a pizza place. If you call and place the order, the person taking the order can change the delivery instructions. It very easily could’ve been an instore person that wrote that.

Oof.

You know the &quot;white robots are racist&quot;? To make it a non-white robot, you would have to go to EXTRA WORK to paint it. White is the color of non-painted, non-dyed plastic. It&#39;s to minimize work, not to be racist.

Didn&#39;t the Berlin Wall sorta work though?

Ay Kuruhs from the start

The measles one hits different in 2020

‘Flu vaccines are not a thing in Europe’ UK: has flu vaccine programme every year Lol

When pewsiepie refers to $300000 as 300000k

Media: White robo racism NASA: We just didn&#39;t wanna give it a paint job

Just reminding everyone he is the guy that took a shit in a shower

<a href="">12:58</a> that’s actually mango flavor, idk how you mistake a mango with an avocado though

If I built a robot it would either not have a exoskeleton or It would be white so it doesn’t overheat as much

That was pretty in pink I’m pretty sure

Bruh the infection thing right before corona

I appreciate the number of comments in the thumbnail

Actually pewds ur early melunium sry that i cant spell it

abortionists: do you expect that teenager to live with the mistake of intialy having sex not thinking about the fact that this IS LITERALY HOW BABIES ARE MADE and go on in their life while trying to raise a child while being a child. me: yes thats how you learn from your mistakes these kids arnt ignoarant or stupid however they may seem so they just choose not to learn from their mistakes because there is no reprimand , no punishment or reason not to

I&#39;ve watched enough Tom and Jerry to know how to use a rotary phone. Does Ellen know how to be a depressed college student?

Felix: If I become president I will ban all social media... now that’s the real facepalm of this video

<a href="">13:56</a> i never realised it was from astro warna omg

Man... Felix is gettin a U.K. accent... he just said cocain as “ckcain”

the avocados  the ones they were importing had cocaine in the seed jejdj

I love how felix always scoffs at the &#39;kids dont know how to use old tech&#39; memes. Like he&#39;s seriously offended every time he sees one. Yet the opposite it hilarious... or even 2 minutes later when he scoffs at a kid for not knowing a manual transmission was.....Make up your mind buddy, you medium sized stick of hypocrisy!

&quot;Take your fedora and eat it&quot; must be one of PDP&#39;s best quotes

yall remember when we thought there was gonna be a measels outbreak... good thing we dodged that bullet am i right!?

i’m gonna pretend i didn’t hear him say the r slur and keep watching

I&#39;m glad there are people who agree on the concept of Cultural Appropriation being complete bs

Felix was so brutal on this vid. Legit, he&#39;s not wrong, people nowadays are so frustrating.

breakfest club felix
<a href="">0:00</a>

being vaccinated for the flu if you are a young adult who is healthy will not help you, the people that die from the flu have one foot inn the grave or has aids

The food appointment got me. Dead XD

The real facepalm is when pewdiepie couldnt figure out <a href="">10:19</a>

Poopdie on switch
Pewds: I don’t know what movie that is“Face palm”

<a href="">11:40</a>  50% 12oz = 6 oz    12 oz + 6 oz = 18 oz xD
Don’t really get how the Berlin Wall is “the best example that walls don’t work.” Berlin Wall kept a couple million people locked in West Berlin for decades... people who basically all would have starved to death if not for repeated and dangerous resupply missions conducted by US and GB. The physical wall, it turns out, worked quite well...I do understand the sort of gross ignorance it takes to make a post like that blonde woman made, though... not the comparison I’d choose to draw either. 

Bruh, he&#39;s never watched the breakfast club

idk man, I think this PewDiePie guy would be a pretty good youtuber

The Manuel car one made me mad

<a href="">5:30</a> this is one of my pet peeves, they can put too much into it because there is no return they made a profit on Stuart little if they put the same amount into the fires because it would fuck the economy up and would cause more problems than it would solve

The Berlin Wall don&#39;t stand anymore... But, I&#39;m just saying

Feix: SPAIN STOP IT, STOP IT SPAINMe, a Spanish person: ...ok sorry

Pewds dosent know breakfast club cring
The cheeseburger patties at McDonald&#39;s are called 10:1 in store. They are 1/10th of a pound.

The Stuart little post was pretty fucking *etarded

&quot;that woman is immature.  Let&#39;s give her a kid&quot;Not quite as immature as the idea that a &quot;fetus&quot; magically turns into a human when it passes through the birth canal

I&#39;m still disappointed Felix hasn&#39;t seen Breakfast Club

I thought this video said ”10 hours ago” i’m not even mad tho

<a href="">10:21</a> her sister was 67 cuz when she was six her sister was 3 and that’s 3 years younger and not 35

Vaccines are dead virus cells going into and they are not for certain dead and it just teaches your body to fight it

Yall ever just click on the video just to look at felix

Solution two:actually try to stop people from burning trees







My conclusion:vegans are secretly trying to pollute the world

<a href="">13:31</a> That is Washington Post. Nothing those clowns say should be taken seriously.

Well now there isn’t trailblazers games

<a href="">1:44</a> me a young white girl who studied spanish for 6 years 
But the Berlin Wall... did work?... but it was torn down, because it wasn&#39;t about preserving a countries borders, but subjugating a ppl? This video is old. Why am I bothering....

I DID NOT FACEPALM THE WHOLE VIDEO. WHAT&#39;S MY PRIZE?

Pewds is a millenial,the oldest millennial  are 39

Pewdiepie is my Jesus
“300 thousand k”

<a href="">12:17</a> That just sounds like a threat.

<a href="">3:42</a> thet&#39;s some vegan teacher stupidity right here

&quot;Math must be some sort of terrorist language&quot;My ELA teacher described in a single phrase

Flu vaccines are a thing here in Europe but  mainly for healthcare professionals and at risk patients

<a href="">0:00</a> Why is there a kuru?

Well the math that we use is Arabic so technically the girl on the plane was right

pewds not knowing the breakfast club made me facepalm

<a href="">8:00</a> I facepalmed cause Felix didn&#39;t got the joke

Pewds: Flu vaccines arent a thing here2020: 

The start of this one aged pretty well. <a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/mSzlXsebCJbI1wLlxqPYBQ"></a><a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/mSzlXsebCJbI1wLlxqPYBQ"></a>

My dad is an engineerGuess he&#39;s not my dad

<a href="">3:00</a> hmmmmmmmmmmmmHnmmmmmmmmHmmmmmm

<a href="">10:13</a> felix not getting  skipping the post faster than light so he doesnt look stupid..

Like in the movie Tokyo Godfathers, where an ambulance randomly crashes into a laundromat (I think), then the driver crawls out and says, &quot;Can somebody call an ambulance?&quot;

<a href="">10:15</a> 67

Black would absorb hear from the surrounding and the heat generated by motors. White on the other hand would reflect heat from the outside. So that robot doesn’t overheat. I think this is the case

Im ashamed to be American

NOT THOMAS! NNNNnnnnnnooooooOOOO!

I&#39;m here to look at multiple Kurus faceplaming behind Pewdiepie

.

That&#39;s a lot of Kurus in the background

<a href="">6:00</a> that&#39;s American brain right there :)Edit:These are all examples of American brains

50% more of 12 is 18

<a href="">0:47</a>Elon Musk: yep

This gave me a headache

I am so glad there was no internet when I was a kid.

@PewDiePie you just HAD to jinx it? What are they gonna do next? Corona is what....

People have always been this dumb, now they just have a broadcasting station in their pocket that can find people exactly as dumb as you to make you&#39;re opinions justified.  Now we have flat earthers, Qanon and anti vaxers and it&#39;s pretty terrifying

Hey KuruHs in PewDiePie viddeo
Flat earth people are religious people, yet you mad because we atheist call their shit out. I need a third hand to facepalm enough.

<a href="">12:02</a> “yaat”?!?!?
Using the color white for important objects such as robots are the best color for it because the robot will absorb/contain less heat and/or radiation than if it were black, since darker colors absorb more heat and energy. This is something we learned before high school, jeezes

I can&#39;t forget my ex Because the password of my tab was her name And now the tab is broken so I can&#39;t change the passwordEverytime I turn on the tab I remember her

<a href="">6:52</a> being fair when first learning differentials, it felt like a terrorist language.

&quot;If I every become president I will ban social media&quot; its not like you make money off videos of social media posts  (facepalm)

wow your videos are great bro dude
Imagine having to sit next to the woman for the rest of the flight. &quot;Ma&#39;am, did you finish school?&quot;

White robots means racism? How is it different from my Tesla that&#39;s black?

Waitttt he said the r slur

Bro I can give you a 1/20 pound burger That alot of burger!

Pewds: If I become president I’m gonna delete all social media platforms Donald Trump:Well now I am not doing it &gt;:(

In California theres signs that say &quot;avocado theft is a crime&quot; near all the orchards

Laughing at kids for not knowing what a casette is, is the same like laughing at an elderly person for not knowing whats a VPN, Discord or Facebook

Felix, you ARE a millennial

Who is more powerful sonic or superman

WHO IS KURU?!
I&#39;m allergic to vegans

Did he say 300 THOUSAND k isn&#39;t that 300 thousand thaosand so basically 300 billion

<a href="">9:27</a> change the hdmi on the <b>REmOtE cOnTrOl</b>

&quot;Three Hundred Thousand K&quot;300000000

Love the Kuru reference at the beginning of Facepalm.

<a href="">1:25</a> eeeexcept this was a religious person calling out an atheist

&quot;all robots are white&quot; what about Markus, huh?

<a href="">10:15</a> 6-3=370-6=643+64=67

lit just watched a pewdiepie ad

Robots are white because you&#39;d rather spend money on research and better parts than spend it on painting the robot every damn time

Felix is cool. I agree with his take on cultural appropriation

And now I wonder if the can&#39;t without the apostrophe in the title was planned or not.

The 1/5 pound burgers is genius haha

<a href="">12:53</a> but that IS him!

iMac Pro stand: $99964 Pairs of Lightning McQueen Crocs: $998Choose wisely...

everybody is ignoring that pewds said, 300 thousand K. No worries just mentioning.

&quot;Three hundred thousand K&quot;  the real facepalm hahaha
