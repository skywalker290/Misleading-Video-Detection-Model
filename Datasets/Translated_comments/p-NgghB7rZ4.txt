I never ever loved Kajol befor this movie the way they have written characters and needs.. a mother always tries to fulfill kids desire..but some where do fails too

Loved the dance

Kajol is just amazing.

Loveddd Kajol throughout this!

What a movie!!!!!

The movie may be amazing but the vulgar words spoken by kajol infront of daughter is not acceptable. Kajol was very loud throughout the movie. Director should have avoided it . It doesnt give good message. Moreover kids cant watch it.

Kajol has left ageing a long time ago

This movie makes you stop and think so many times.

Rubbish she didn&#39;t get the tribhangi pose correct.  It&#39;s the most graceful Odissi dance pose.

BAM NETFLIX

the backbencher rap is out on my channel risten it i am a rapper

This movie has done a wonderful job in portraying women&#39;s real life and all the ups and downs in them

I loved. This movie it was so relatable and real

nepo-kids and karan jockers drugs gang taking over Netflix.
100% recommended movie to watch with grandmother &amp; moms guys its a fun😂&amp; Kajol did a fabbbbb job 🔥Loved the story writing dialogues cinematography actors❤️

Boy: will you marry me  ?Girl: do you have a house ?Boy: No, but ?Girl: do you have a BMW car ?       Boy : No, but ?Girl : how much is your salary ? Boy : no salary, but ?Girl : you have Nothing, how can I marry you, just leave me, please.Girl leaves...Now Boy talking to himself : I have one villa, 3 plots, 1 ferrari, 2 porsche, 1 Lamborghini, why I still need to buy a cheapBMW, and how can I get salary when actually I am the boss.MORAL :    Don&#39;t judge anyone without knowing the whole thing,  be a listener .If you enjoyed the story plz do “ SUBSCRIBE ” to my channel, I have to reach 2k .And I m sure u will love my content.have a nice day.

these two were brilliant. love Roy Kapur. he is so subdued and brilliant in his acting and loved Kajol so over the top and perfectly acted character. i desperately wanted to see her do a small Odissi dance though.

This movie itself is good...but especially this scene , it was awesome!!😎😎😎

Who thought that mithila means mythpat??

Kajol is more overacting. Mithila was excellent

Awesome movie..  Kajol just rocked

Kajol👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing

What a script and act

Waaa

I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.
