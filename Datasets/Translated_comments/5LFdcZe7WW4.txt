This podcast is funnier than dunki 

Still waiting for that wedding episode 

Still waiting for that wedding show.

We keep coming back, Am I right or Am I right guys?

Watching 10th time this masterpiece 

STILL WAITING FOR THE WEDDING SHOW

<a href="">28:16</a> this is the funniest part

What did Meryl Streep say?

Bro when will you play?
Vishal is chilling in the background

this is the magic every director refers to when they say &quot;Shah spoils you as a director&quot; , he starts performing in the script narration with variations.

Who is here recently

02/11/23 - watching this on SRK birthday after a very heartfelt conversation with Madeha on her couch with masala chai in Romford,London

Happy birthday sharuk khan sir
These four guys are really very irritating especially their loud laugh I mean seriously unnecessarily keeps laughing

WAO superb marvelous awesome amazing .....

I want AIB to make a come back with a new SRK podcast. Please!! 

Day 2,460 waiting for wedding show....

Who did more work in award shows than Will Smith: 
waiting for the wedding shoot

Bolne to do srk ko,, has has ke podacast g mar di ..

Podcasts are cool and now everywhere. AIB did 6-7 years back. They were ahead of times.

Man he is the best 

<a href="">4:45</a>  <a href="">11:52</a> <a href="">22:32</a> he is right i hate such kind of pants<a href="">26:04</a> he is really too middle lass and a star at the same time  <a href="">28:15</a> 

i have watched this  video 250 times in a span of 2.5 years but it took me 1.5 years to recognise you guys were sitter shah house....

Kaha ho be AIB

If anyone would have mastered in humour it&#39;s him for sure 

<a href="">8:03</a> 6 years later SRK made that the reality

yeh wedding show hua kya?

can these podcast ever get old ?? Best Collaboration ever

Where is the wedding show with @srk... still not out yet 

AIB got roasted by SRK alone, you cant bear SRK

<a href="">24:25</a> Best moment 

That biscuit part act was some of the star kid&#39;s whole career

I wish to visit shahrukhkhan home in Mumbai
‏‪I really love you shahrukhkhan I like this video

Still waiting for the Wedding Show!

<a href="">12:22</a>  meme material 
I honestly can&#39;t tell how many times I&#39;ve watched this two episode of AIB with SRK️ podcast. Every time I see it, it&#39;s like the first time, even it feels same enjoyable if I start watching from anywhere in the podcast. At the end of the podcast, every time I regret &#39;why aren&#39;t there more videos like this&#39;. Really impressed to see the person SRK open up so deeply. Also his sense of humor, just awesome. Like the &#39;Superstar SRK&#39;, &#39;SRK the person&#39; is also incomparable. I wish, I could hear more of his life incidents of different period of time from him like the way he express here. Love u Shahrukh KhanMay Allah bless U.Love from BD🇧🇩

Far better than Ranveer allahbadia

SRK

the best . have to come once in a while to rewatch this

I&#39;m still waiting for the collab play of a Wedding Show written by SRK :(

His comic sence &amp; story telling ability ️️️
@<a href="">10:45</a> - green book on table titled “Muhammad”, proves his love and admiration to prophet Muhammad. No matter how secular he would sound but at heart he’s a Muslim - Keep it up SRK 

Hey can anyone tell me where is this podcast shot ? Is that SRK&#39;s house?

&quot;When you are poor your socks smell worst&quot; 

These guys started podcasts when podcasts was not even a thing

Still the best SRK version we saw till date! Need more of these ;)

Aasif Sheikh is KING DAVID

Muhammad book on table of srk

<a href="">25:48</a> Harry Potter Novels in SRK House 
<a href="">19:48</a> this will be enough for how good his acting skills are

After Pathaan &amp; Jawan - Hope Shahrukh starts waking like old times like King of Bollywood not like - &#39;Konsa King, Konsa Bollywood&#39; 

I am not a fan, because i am such a big star. 
I mean ... he is an effortless absolute charmer

I want to know who the &quot;do you love me?&quot; guy was on the international live show that SRK mentioned.

At <a href="">29:45</a> tanmay messaged something to Shakya over phoneThis is what happens when you watch a video too many times.

Where wedding show

It&#39;s  been 6 years and i&#39;m still waiting for that ONE WEDDING SHOW 

It is 2023 and we are still waiting for &quot;wedding show with SRK&quot; !!!

Kb aa rhi h ye wedding show?
Its so so refreshing after watching this after so many years now one of the finest interview i hace ever watched

One man show !

Where is this place

Is there any feature jisse m tanmay bhat ko mute kar saku

It’s 2023, I am still waiting for FIFA night, wedding show, &amp; world tour show vlogs of Tanmay Bhat starring Shah Rukh Khan, and his erstwhile AIB team - Ashish Shakya, Rohan Joshi &amp; Khamba! Miss you AIB. I have kept coming back to this amazing podcast at least once a year! SRK at his best. P.S - When SRK said he writes his wedding play, it reminded me of Barack Obama, who used to write his own speeches.

AIBs are just laughing, they are not getting any chance to speak

After the several years passed but this podcast still shines .Srk is masterpiece 

<a href="">24:23</a> 

Here after JAWAN 
Hehe
WOW

The fake laughing like hyenas was so annoying

Who is here after jawaan join here️️️
<a href="">7:11</a>

Are you able to watch the reel? Come on, show me Dunga!
Watching this after Jawan, hits different.

How can anyone hate this guy, like seriously.

what a guy. A true entertainer, very modest. The 3 idiots could not keep up.

The wedding showWaiting for it
Srk is such a chill and funny guy  I freakin love his interviews and podcasts 

Anyone rewatching this after watching JAWAN?

Jawan
Coming back after Jawan

Who is here after JAWAN release

1. Which Meryl streep comment / interview they werw talking about?2. Can anyone name the books on the table?

You see this SRK here and then...it&#39;s 2023 and SRK launches movies like Jawaan. (Sigh!)

This content is truly incredible. The humour and laid back attitude brings out such insightful and honest conversation. It’s so refreshing to see SRK speak so candidly. Keep up the good work. Hats off 

Thank you for having the video with subtitles. It was a great conversation, I laughed heartily!!! SRK is great as always!!! 
It&#39;s a tradition to come back to this video every year.

He be like &quot;Hum bure log hai,bure waqt mein kaam ayenge&quot;BODMASSSH&quot;Bollywood is ignoring u&quot;

Tanmay was thin lol

Love the FIFA conversation. Calling an actor of his status out, and having him give a legit response for how things are said in passing. Good stuff!

4 comedians in a room, still the funniest person is fifth.

Item ko dimag nahi or faltugiri profession hain to u have to do it dutifully na...heroine

Item is getting paid
Mujhe bas yahi Darr rahta tha ki kahin Shahrukh se coffee cup na gir jae...

2 minutes silence for those who are not as scripted.
How can you even boycott this man??

SRK
SRK 
Love SRK 
This guy is such a mega mega star! How can someone not love him?

Kahani abhi baaki hai  and it is going to be very interesting. The facade ripped.

2023
Lol are your socks smelling Tanmay stares at khamba 

Watching it in 2023, after finding my close relevance...

<a href="">21:10</a> where is the wedding show? SRK sir ? 

His sense of humor throughout 

This is my 10000000000th time

They did a poscast when poscast was not even a thing.

<a href="">15:41</a>  Im died laughing at this point, how Shah react at this AiB ka roast 

<a href="">15:41</a>  Im died laughing at this point, how Shah react at this AiB ka roast 

Humorously smart SRK.. what have you done this guy.. even after 6 years his interview is still entertaining..
<i>Jo _log</i> (ALLAH) <i>ki</i> Uttari <i>Houwi</i> (SHARI,AT)_And (Last) NABI( Muhammad )PBUH _ K_ (DEEN) K_ MUTABIQ_ FAISSLE <i>NAHI</i> _KARRTE?{THOSE} _ Arr _Qa'Firrs
Just like he said He is the last of the stars. After him Bollywood is completed dead.

This is called real podcast, meanwhile Ranveer to other players what are your views on virat kohli, dhoni.. blllaaaahhh blla bllaah

Rohan is jerk
Wedding show guys? Helloooo! 
the beginning with the three of them on the couch and you turn the camera and there&#39;s SHAHRUKH KHAN sitting there hahaha

4 comedians , but srk has all the jokes and perfecf timings…Truly charismatic

@ <a href="">6:29</a> SRK is saying, &quot;I prayed in every language to every GOD&quot; is this your Faith as a  Muslim (so called I guess), there is 1 God only as Allah !!!

SHAH OF BHARAT SHAHRUKHKHAN 
Me: watching this kind of videos instead attending my class.

27 June 2023
In podcast u shd let the guest talkn .. dn&#39;t interrupt too much

The difference between other podcast and this one itself tells you about his humour

Wit = SRK

Maybe this is the time we need more AIB podcasts

Aj kal ke bacche jo podcast kr rhe hai Tanmay bhat me 6 sal pehle kar ke chor diya 

@shahrukh khan.... Please do &quot;FIFA NIGHT&quot; with these AIB people.... and please be live.....

All India mathedachod tu bacchod

These guys were ahead of their time . Now everyone is doing podcast

<a href="">25:01</a> anyone has researched this????

When is the wedding show??
Hollywood has rdjBollywood has srk SRK 
SRK 
&quot;I don&#39;t do dandruff things.. Coz I m Shahrukh... Mereko na vaise ye daad khaad khujli nai hoti hai&quot;.Mast tha ye, Osmm man! 

<a href="">20:51</a>

What is there in Hindi speaking?  Hindustani ho speaks Hindi when no one understands Hindi and speaks in English, English is a language just like Hindi, this is why we speak in Hindi and it does not do the same while speaking in Hindi.  SRK is not equal. bola jitna ye sale log pachar pachar English bol rhe he Angrejoke pedaish sale
Me
I have watch ed this video at least one time a year from past 5 years.

Wedding show, wedding wedding.
.

<a href="">10:58</a> Well...... This aged well 

I just want to know who were those wedding guest ??

Galat

It&#39;s a ritual to come here once in a while...

The power that Shah Rukh Khan holds over not just India, but the world is insane and he knows it

Hindi ....left the chat

8th April, 2023. Still watching it

hats of to aib guys. being invited to mannat by srk theyre legit wearkng shorts

Inka wedding video kbh aaega
Let me warn you first and that the name of your channel is wrong, you change it as soon as possible otherwise I will handle it in a different way, legally, so you correct the name of your CJANNAL, otherwise I will force you. A case will have to be filed.
This is literally a&quot;ONE MAN SHOW&quot;️

Man mohan singh be like - Why did you roast me bhai
I can&#39;t stop playing both parts on repeat!

<a href="">5:17</a> like today a useless battle between Kohli and SRK circulating in Twitter

Where is wedding skit?

Every 2-3 month, watch it again

Un d (active)  undisturbed sets ...non no no one

If you become a fan after reading then you are not a fan!! You are the only one who speaks English, don't jump on the bandwagon!!
thanks a lot.....very good to watch.

@<a href="">15:19</a> Shahrukh Baba&#39;s prediction of AIB

Who is watching this for the nth time?

Maja aaya
is this srk&#39;s house?

 My Favourite King og Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan 
I like tanmay and crew but atleast sharukh he yaar thoda respect se attire wise thoda to kar sakte he

Biswa look like courage the cowardly dog shows owner 

I think its a tradition of mine to revisit this classic once in awhile

Tanmay ka baap ka umar ka h wo banda naam se pukar rahe h show some respect man he is a legend

&quot;asli maza to Salman bhai ke sath hi ata hai&quot;

Feb 2023...... 

...

He is really something else.srk alien hi ho sakta hain aise khudko banaya hain

SRK Love

He can become standup comedian, a podcaster, interviewer, a host, a storyteller, writer anyday anytime.

Was i living under a stone or something? This video is GOLD. and SRK&#39;s humour is so on another level

still waiting for the play.....

&quot;I&#39;m not a fan cause i&#39;m a big star&quot; was hilarious af

I wish Rohan and Khamba's mic would be muted.
Sad to see he can&#39;t speak his mind in this country dude

still waiting for that wedding skit !!!

That Manmohan Singh did not age well .. lol

Still waiting for the wedding show 

The Potterhead in me noticed the cursed child book behind Shah Rukh. 

Still waiting for the &quot;Wedding show&quot; ...!!!

Does his T really have holes or is that some kind of fashion as well?

When is the wedding show happening 

<a href="">15:23</a> THAT did not age well
The collection of books is awesome 

AIB people are so angry that they have not listened to Shahrukh's first couplets and they have not been able to even listen to the podcast.
<a href="">#GiveSrkAllTheAwards</a> Coz In 2023 It&#39;s Actually Possible ️
Still waiting for marriage skit

Coming here after the massive success of Pathan. Six years later he is still the King!

no wonder Pathaan is a blockbuster.

Its Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s personality, charm and wits that I envy!.

AIB please come back! these are genuinely too funny!

His fluency with his great humour  SRK

Still waiting for the wedding sketch

So much relevant in the times of Pathaan too....

Srk should do more podcasts

&quot;Its all about a selfie&quot;- best line

Who is here after pathan blockbuster

Fun fact : this is not your first time

<a href="">20:41</a> that red t shirt guy&#39;s  soul left his body for a moment. 

Who is here after watching the reels 

The OG podcast️

<a href="">24:00</a> it&#39;s been 6 years AIB!! Any plans of making that show with SRK?

End of it all &quot;it&#39;s all about a selfie &quot; ..well 2 am talk went that way for sure .... 

Relatable during “Pathan”  release controversies!

i am waiting for the play!

SRK Multi talent Actor 
Whenever I can&#39;t find anything interesting to watch while having food.. I come back to this.. He&#39;s so good.. ️

Tanmay has same couch in his house at <a href="">1:40</a>

still the best podcast

Everyone is a roaster and comedian until the badshah arrives 

By far the most interesting hilarious funniest and engaging podcast india has ever witnessed...️Thanks srk for existing 

Rohan and the guy besides him going to Shahrukh&#39;s place and chatting with him in freaking shortsss!!!

AIB is gone. We lost THIS.

The most humble man..kaash I have talked to him once.
Still not even matchable to Irrfan Sir.

I&#39;m that random guy from Ahmedabad watching this video at 5 AM 5 years after it was uploaded.

Why am i doing so many revisions of thos podcast before pathaan

and they waited for wedding show

I don&#39;t have any stuff to watch and randomly I saw this video  it&#39;s like a comedy show

everytime i miss sharukh khan...i watch this video....i kinda feel like i am hanging out with him

Rohan Joshi unfunny brick
And here 5 years later , i am sure he has still not done that wedding show w you guys. FIFA NIGHT

Mr Shah Rukh Khan Sir 
SRK ️
Podcast with best comedian and Tanmay bhat

This best of episodes

Shah Rukh is the coolest actors in the world

2022 still fresh !
<a href="">14:51</a>- yeah!  Muaah
I think Zakir Khan and SRK would be great talk

sab thik hai.. nhi bhai sab thik hai..but him saying &quot;this house is very small&quot;.. main kithhey jawaann??

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 7 years.. Still hold up beautifully.. Kudos to AIB  and the  KING

Now watching it for 50th time.

Is this even a podcast .... Bunch of wanna be trying to be funny and shouting .... Total bullshit

I have always been doubtful about the bollywood stars, but when I watch and listen to SRK, he looks different. I don’t know how is he in real life, but I love the way this man’s personality. Surely, there’s a lot for me to learn from the person I interpret him to be.

November 2022 , &amp; Still hereee

That&#39;s the biggest star in the world sitting with a bunch of YouTubers jocking n chilling n being the funniest in the room. So full of respect this person is. The Last Of the Stars indeed. Happy Birthday King.

<a href="">9:05</a> Manmohan singh was Prime Minister for 10 years it&#39;s not like USA

No One Can Beat SRK  ..
Brother please give me a selfie too
4 comedians in the room still overshadowed by the King

Watching it 1000th time

Still waiting for that wedding show xD <a href="">#aibxsrk</a>

SRK x AIB ️
Wow! That&#39;s awesome!

<a href="">7:08</a>

When Podcast wasn&#39;t a thing in India.

Top comedian in rhe room sharukh ️️
<a href="">#weddingshowwithSRK</a> hey AIB m sure u must have tried but since SRK has so many films pipelined this can be biggest promotional show…coz he has the best wit ever n m sure this will break the internet… please remind him …many thanks in advance 

His comic timing 

&quot;When you are poor you&#39;re socks smell worse&quot;- Shah Rukh Khan 2017

Which book Tanmay is talking about related to Prime minister Manmohan Singh?

When is your wedding show coming out?

I can&#39;t describe how I love this interview ️️

Whenever i feel bad i always come to this channel to watch this video .. this video is hilarious even after 5yrs .. 20.08.2022

King 
Koi nhi you are my king...Stop smoking And don&#39;t give your kid a yacht give him his mother&#39;s love....Paisa bht zyada h tere paras???Mannat ko muharram bna du pathn??

any context on the Meryl Streep speech?

King SRK ️️️
This  man is class apart 

He is all in one yrr

Actor like Rajkumar Rao, Ayushman Khurana calls srk &quot;sir&quot; and these guys acts like he is their childhood buddy 

And AIB ended just like thatWe would to see that episode

Now we like podcast
people watching it in 2022

Intense

I think we need appreciate this fact more that it has been almost 5.5 years since this interview and there still hasn&#39;t been an interview/chat with an Indian movie actor that has been more entertaining. This is pretty much a fact.

wait that&#39;s shah rukhs home???

When did they realise that wedding show and world tour was also like fifa thing .

Maturity is when you realise that you like shah rukh khan because of his work ethic, character and his mannerism!

some 2 lakh rupee per month are taking interview of 1 crore rupee per month man.

SRK 
Collab you guys again!!!!!!! 
So Will the wedding show happen? 

After 5 yrs still watching and still one of best punch line I laughed on ,was at <a href="">24:00</a> ...

Still waiting for the wedding show

WELL its OVER now

<a href="">13:46</a> Toooooo funny

Anyone who is watching this and missing Shahrukh khan and AIB content

<a href="">24:23</a>!.. lit
Who have come here watching tanmay bhat today&#39;s vlog

He had tattoo ?

It is such a shame that AIB had to be brought down due to some reason and it&#39;s proven by the visitors this channel gets even today. I feel bad for all the four founders and co-founders who had to part their ways but I am glad to see that they are back on track with there carrier. Tanmay started his own channel and Rohan stars on it and all its from here I got know about AIB. I wish all the co founders and founders all the very best and thank you for making such content in the past and really rooting for AIB is revival.

O god I was wearing headphones

I still watch the whole episode all together even after 5 years .It is just so satisfying.

it&#39;s my first time watching his interview completely and he is such a funny guy what an amazing humor yaar

Sir, I am taking a selfie, mango is for health.
is it mannat srk house?

We are still waiting for the wedding show, if you remember 

abe  loolle  bohot  SNIFF  kar  raha  hai ...  peechle  janam  mein  KUTTA  tha  kya ...

can somebody tell me which madona or meryl streep speech is srk referring to here at <a href="">12:50</a> ?

<a href="">21:17</a> Am I the only one who&#39;s waiting for that &quot;one wedding show&quot; for these many years and still hopeful that it will happen someday???

badiya videooh
Watching this video for the 10th time.



That wedding skit SRK suggested never happened! Another FIFA night 

SRK be like:Delhi sein hoo benchod,mujh sein mooh laraye gah
I wanted to check if that wedding show happened ? 

Did SRK had the wedding play with AIB

WEDDING SHOW KAB HORAHIIIHEINN!!!!!

THE MARRIAGE SKIT...

Bajirao Mastani part was just awesome

Cool Wedding wala play kya aayega?
Till date no one came close to taking this kind of interview..

This interview is going to keep ageing like fine wine you can keep rewatching from time to time

Love you srk 
listening <a href="">14:30</a> after will smith incident at oscars. :D:D

Waiting for the skit.

Awesome 
Still waiting for that wedding show in 2022.

Amazing philanthropic character

It&#39;s all about SRK Sir&#39;s anecdote

<a href="">13:00</a>     <a href="">21:30</a>

<a href="">21:00</a> Srk encourages dowry ! 50 lakhs to steal the girl! Raw truth of his wickedness! Breaking (wind )news!

factor and xyz maths max  

New video do bhai
Where is that wedding skit

Kya band he yr SRK
It’s 2022 and I’m still waiting for that wedding skit.

&quot;tanmay that was not active passive voice. what is wrong w you?&quot;

His personality is so admirable 

Please say something in Hindi also, please appreciate it.
It's been 5 years brother. Wedding show is not coming ???
Hi Tanmay and gang, I am seeing this in 2022  and I HOPE you guys have gone to any world tour with SRK.. Tanmay is the most funny guy I have seen after Shehnaaz Gill love your sense of humour bro… 

Wedding shoooowww........
srk is too good

Little did SRK know that the next year he would get such a blow that he would never be able to recover for the next five years

I like sharuk in this interview haha

I didn’t like when sharuk khan and that jersey actor made brutally fun of late Sushant Singh , even it’s a pre written script please don’t accept that really hurts innocent people like me. So I m not going to watch Jersey .. shahid s new film,

Time to watch this for the 1625373th time! ‍️

@<a href="">3:20</a>

After 5 years!!

5 years laterSri waiting for AIB wedding sketch with SRK

This episode has so much re-watchability value

Imagine watching this after oscars this year n willy being blocked from attending oscars for next decade. 

This brother has noticed that he has reduced his voice and his voice has increased.
Yeah meryl streep is the president of USA at last in a movie called DON&#39;T LOOK UP.

Wedding show aajaye bas

When Tanmay asked that &quot;you&#39;ll wake up one day and something happened over somewhere and you have nothing to do with it and now you&#39;re debate of the day&quot; Is what happened to Ricky Gervais @ Oscar 2022

SRK&#39;s humor is just outstanding

<a href="">22:40</a>

We are still waiting for that wedding show.

I keep coming back

At <a href="">10:28</a> srk said that he used to remove his anger sometimes at award shows. So does that mean when he threw bottle at Sushant at award function ,it was also unscripted and srk just did that ??? Because sushant&#39;s expression seemed like it was completely unscripted.

I am being impressed by SRK&#39;s Sense of humour, hair and humbleness day by day. 

that wedding script also didn&#39;t happen just like FIFA 

Its 2022, And I am watching it 100th time...What a wittiness this man possess!

That line of SRK - When you are poor.. Socks smell worse.

Soo many great books , wow !!!

The moment when he said ,&quot; Roast for you is FAN. Good performance but completely dying.&quot; Can hear SRK&#39;s pain

Tanmay- sharukh did demonetization affect you?Sharukh- died Me- died
WEDDING

Please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who comes here everytime I want to laugh so hard  love SRK and his wittiness  truly a king 

What a guy. “King of Bollywood” who doesn’t doesn’t take it seriously, yet knows no one challenges him.

YouTube automatically continued with this video after finishing watching the Podcast about awards shows. The things I like about the YT algorithm.

Srk is  comedian more than superstar

It&#39;s March 2022 , but haven&#39;t such cool thing recently , I am not a huge fan of Shahrukh but have never seen such spontaneous person ever

Still charismatic! ️ Srk has got such vibe to him! 

<a href="">20:41</a> koi merese ese baat krta to gnd pht jyegi

He didn&#39;t know then there is a first class in the plane....now he owns private plane/s

Because you old agers lived your life own way so don t fuck present youth life and don t fuck them with your fucking rules and ethnicity cultures riti rivaj just stop it

Old age person should stop country youth because every 30 years of youth have diffrent thinking mentality and they own understanding to live there life so don t fuck there careers and life

Hahaha.... That line, &quot;In west, roasting is normal, but you guys did once and your career is over&quot; 

<a href="">16:20</a> biscuit story
I love you so much ️️️️️️️️️️️
Bhai truly delhi ka banda h ️full bkchod he is great so funny always ️
How much money shahrukh khan charge for this show??Guys any guess

His Royalty Speaks ️King For A Reason

(Merly Streep )she did be came a president in a movie (don&#39;t look up 2022)

Please take away the mic from Rohan Joshi. Man he is such a Noise Polluter!

So he says he was always hapy to laugh at himself and not take anything serious, but when u made fun of sushant and Neil nitin mukesh and neil gave it back to you and said shut up, why didnt you laugh and take it light. Right after that his career was over. So PLS dont tell me you are that down to earth. No way!!! The MOST arrogant khan along with you rbestie salman.

Its been 5 years, I am still waiting for &quot; the Wedding Show&quot; and the &quot;World Tour&quot;

<a href="">6:17</a> &quot;Konsa king?!&quot;He&#39;s just the best

1 on 4, I did not want him to stop talking. He is magical, simply magic.

This is like the 50th time i am watching this.. And I love it every time.. I love to hear him speak.. It calms me and my anxiety

Come back 
I love this conversation, thank you tanmay bhatt for this beautiful convo

I listen to this podcast atleast once a year .

Can&#39;t believe Sharukh got them twice, first fifa and then wedding show  Toote Sapne 

Where is the wedding show ?

Day 900: still waiting for the wedding play

he has a one of the best sence of humor in entire indian flim industry

I felt so much that I got filmfare.
It is 2022 : This was FIFA NIGHT for them.

SRK has great personality ️

You guys need to get back yr ! That&#39;s the way u do a podcast ! <a href="">#comebackAIB</a>

Watching SRK laughing artificially is very boring.... 

Love  it man
Please make the wedding show happen guysss!!! SRK was so excited for it!!!

After 4 yr  I&#39;m rewatching it

Where is the wedding show? and where did it go?
Now Rohan gifted Tanmay PS5 

When is that wedding show coming with Shah Rukh khan

What a wit!A-maze 

Whose that moti....

Charisma of the KING

<a href="">15:07</a> self roast

Friend, please bring back that old AIB.
<a href="">6:18</a> Best moment ...

King khan !
what a useless discussion..

Did FIFA night happen?

Watched it more than 5 times at least , what a personality man !

Roast is not necessary it was crass we don&#39;t have to copy the west in everything

Druggie beta and wife bhi druggies

I am just decreasing and increasing the volume when those four of them laugh and then increase when Shah Rukh speaks! 

<a href="">21:20</a> when you guys are gonna do a wedding show with him? Still waiting for it

When this wedding show with Shahrukh going to happen, or he had said that just in the flow..  

The sound system is not right.

Even if  sadhguru couldn&#39;t let it be!!  it is kaliyug! 

This is disturbing! ! 

Wow Wish I could talk like him ️

Wedding show update (2021): Not yet.

Just four fanboys fawning at their god :)

<a href="">12:05</a> And now she&#39;s playing the role of President in Don&#39;t Look Up

The coolest podcast ever recorded in human history

<a href="">#GiveAllTheAwardsToShahrukh</a> Although he deserves too.️

Watching this in end of the 2021 AIB vapis chahiye hum ko

Vo this is inside mannat

<a href="">1:30</a> No buddy this can’t happen  you’re talking about Messi and Ronaldo

4 comedian beaten by srk  (verbally)..Srk steals d show
please take bath tanmaye bhatt

<a href="">13:50</a>

<a href="">16:20</a> shahrukh on advertising

He is wearing Aryan&#39;s clothes....lol

Before Tommy Hilfiger was racist daaamn

What are you doing? Chak De, Fuck De...
&quot;They should be happy I&#39;m not stealing the bride away&quot;- Hilarious XD

AIB ppl sitting on srk&#39;s couch more comfertably than srk himself .

YouTube has recommended me this video for n&#39;th time.... and here i m watching it for n&#39;th time......

Waiting for the show that marriage show

Sharukh Khan ️️
so the amazon prime ad interaction was more hyped than this ... Okay

4 Years after and same laugh&#39;s 

Here after Tanmay&#39;s vlog!
Feel so bad of what happened with Aryan, although being an adult he should have dealt with it on his own but it was all about being srk kid that he got caught in the first place.

FIFA ki baat karu ?
<a href="">#azzyreacts</a>
Just love SRK&#39;S humour Anyone noticed the trophies...

Came here after 4 years and Shahrukh talking about not doing ads he doesn&#39;t like. Phir background mein Zubaan Keshari 

can ya&#39;ll put timestamps

Look at all those books. I love this place

<a href="">20:37</a> what was that?

Wedding show …. :(

In hawaon se patte girte hai Shahrukh Khan nhi Love this man since childhood.

They were trying to roast him but turned the table on them and give them good podcast on the way. King of boluwood for sure. And very wise man man how dodged some these shades wuhuuuh 

who is watching after aryan khan arrest?

SRK said &quot;selfie fixes everything!&quot;

Cocaines a hella drug

It&#39;s heartbreaking what they did to you SRK. You&#39;ll always be King Khan. All my love ️

Beside black guy near sharuk coffing and sneezing …..such a disgusting

On the center table valuable books , MUHAMMAD by Martin Lings (Green book) this book on Prophet Muhammad(PBUH). Now, I know how he have such a profound knowledge and humbleness. Guys, who wants to be like this should focus the books all around in room.

Dayss

GOLD

We know now 3 and a half years later  why he always choose to be silent  - _ -

Now a day&#39;s srk and his son is a topic of debate Tanmay sir badi kali jaban hai 

Your Roast is just Your FANGood performance bad execution or responseMan it did hurt as a Shah Rukh Fan 

So ppl are now gonna see this self proclaimed moru comedian talk rubbish ?

Srk has good communication and storytelling skill 

Still relevent??
Only SRK has the capability to make Tanmay laugh out loud. Period !

the only person who can overshadow the legends themselves is srk. My goodness, HE is very well self aware.

Pura interview Charo Paad rokh ki Baithe hoge 

Oh! So I got recommended after Aryan got bail.

Y

Hmmm

Exactly ab konsa king aur konsa bollywood

Srk l diya ।
At <a href="">10:06</a> SRK saying this house is too small  bhai MATLAB .. Bhai

And now king khan is news till the rest of his life

You have to do your stupid thing, something special has happened to you and see what kind of a bolt it is.
You know, SRK should try stand-up

How many Filmfare trophies are there ???

WORLD TOUR AND WEDDING SHOW BRO!!!!!! @tanmay bhat please yaar make this one count and please release the video for us

Coming here after Aryan Khan&#39;s drug case, comes a little funny 

The one who is most philosophical is the least intelligent.  The actual intelligent guy knows the technical and practical aspects on how to live a life. Shahrukh is much more practical than any other person I know.

<a href="">15:40</a> can anyone tell me the context here??

I was laughing the whole time

Srk......, 
Oh SRK

<a href="">24:23</a> I find it kinda sweet that he actually kept those Nickelodeon trophies he got from that channel. I remember it was some kind of kids&#39; hosted award show or something, not something immensely relevant. Anyone would&#39;ve expected them to be misplaced and gone within a couple days...................

the only thing funny about this video is SRK&#39;s humor and wit which is funny considering people consider AIB funny.. the light grey t shirt-ed guy is the most unfunny guy even

Shahrukh is wearing an awesome shirt

<a href="">18:04</a>

Here after His son&#39;s arrest
That biscuit part killed it. 
The reason why this video has fewer views is because Srk is speaking in English XD

<a href="">11:17</a> ️ I was also thinking the same thing from the beginning... Watch their conversation
Looking for part 2 with srk

Next level of creativity.....srk fun club....love u srk

Who is here after Aryan khan got arrested

Biscuit emotion
Messi and Ronaldo have gone a little too far 
Shah Rukh with his groupies

The anchors laughs so laudly that one cannot here the guest.along with it she one anchor say something another one again speaks over so laudly that it&#39;s hard to understand what they are saying.pls sort out your way and speak little gently

Whoever is less drunk ?

Too good. Off-screen he is too good. He should be same while acting in films..

How can I learn best in class humour and conversation like shahrukh!!

<a href="">12:53</a> This is why I got the filmfare award and I have to speak this speech 
My favourite star srk...

King for a reason.. overshadowed everyone of AIB

This aged well

<a href="">11:07</a> SRK laughed vigorously...but the scene was edited out

SRK should have his own talk show.

Still waiting for this play.

SRK is crowd controlling even in a podcast...a pro speaker..

Wow, he&#39;s so full of himself.

and zuban kesari is something srk related to

Aapki problem aap hi sambhalo Goa is on !!!

<a href="">26:03</a> srk is behaving like discussing with friends ️️

Man what a presence of mind he have..... really this man is class of itself.

What are these guys talking about?

Middle guy laughing is so annoying

The tranquil cotton extraorally soothe because glue bailly trust per a barbarous case. actually, sticky pike

&quot;Konsa king, konsa bollywood &quot; that part 
Best humour SRK has...he can make laugh anyone

Wedding skit nikalo srk sir ke saath
Where&#39;s the wedding skit!???

<a href="">24:24</a> 

Watching this on 2021

What. A. Podcast.

Is it srk house??

<a href="">26:16</a> When you are poor socks smell.<a href="">26:18</a> Tanmay looked at Gur.
Watching it in August 2021 still it looks so fresh

Still waiting for the wedding show

Crazyy fun from SRK. Where is he lost now 

Tony StArk
Srk is real star

SRK said you guys do one roast and your career is over.... Ho gaya bhai 

The couch in which Tanmay is sitting at the time of discussion is still there with him in his house.️..Go watch his vlogs to see that!!

I didn&#39;t understand when he said .. they also do stand-up .. they have thier jokes ... Who are they and who are them ? What&#39;s the basis of this division .. I didn&#39;t get that

Humour level - SRK 
<a href="">

Did the wedding skit ever got out.........

Still waiting for the wedding show...

Still waiting for that marriage skit, AIB please don&#39;t let it go as FIFA night.

The big question still remainsDid AIB finally get to play fifa with SRK?

<a href="">15:00</a> cheap thrills

After solo many years 
There is only one ️ God

Fifa night
Do you love me. ? ,
<a href="">20:58</a> did anyone see thug life glasses coming from the top

What about juba Kesri srk

they are in srk house.....MANNNAT wow

<a href="">24:21</a> Srk realised that it&#39;s a serious issue...

Even after 4 years it&#39;s still the best and better than the 4 comic could do.

Is that biswa. wow

Team aib was in mannatDid someone noticed??

4 years down the line and I am still waiting for that wedding show.....

Srk
&quot;Shahrukh, did demonatization affect you?&quot;  this had me 

Back to this epic video after 4years :D SRK should start his own channel and give us some content &lt;3

<a href="">26:11</a> Shahrukh: &quot;when you are poor your socks smell&quot;, 

<a href="">26:18</a> Tanmay looks at Khamba thinking: &quot;He&#39;s talking about us&quot;.

This AIB team brought a comedy aoura around SRH that made SRK to flair up what actually he is when team travelled with him into a diff. World. Often a rare video that come across in youtube

&quot; People who can make fun of themselves actually are the most confident &quot;Well said SRK sir ️

Tea mug was the luckiest thing. Was at the risk of falling from the table.

I hope srk gave them some cash to get decent clothes to sit on front of biggest superstar india has got

Narcissism at its peak

.

Anyone from Bot Army in 2021?

Aib literally destroyed their content and channel after podcasting this romantic fooler ps: i know hate will pour awawy

Best srk podcast everrrrrr
Itna Bada Show Aur Naam Dekho - Bakch*d  New generation is teaching itself.
Aib..We fing miss you

chutiyon ka ek group baith ke aap ke time ki mum dad kar raha hai,too much inspired by western life ,,,gande se accent me aap ki pure time ki mom dad kar rahe hainn.they have changed every thing lekin apni skin nahi bdal paa rahe hain eska afsos enko zaroor hota hoga.Idiots

Real House srk

Srk is quite since BJP has come to power

Shahrukh is love

I remember my class mate copy everything of Sharukh kha..

It&#39;s highly unfortunate that personality of Shah Rukh Khan is indulging in all the shit of All India Bakchod

<a href="">24:23</a> what a question OMG 

Comment Section active after 4 years

The level of Sarcasm and Sense of humour .. died by laughing ..

Still The best Podcast ever in the history.. SRK 

Honestly Shah Rukh Khan is one of the most charming and charismatic personality. He&#39;s witty and got the sense humour and yet is the wisest and the most intelligent. How can anyone not love this man God bless you SRK

There are few people who can influence us by the way they carry themselves

<a href="">3:11</a>

I can hear him for hourssss

Is am the only one who thinks this conversation is better than our political converstions.

I miss AIB!

<a href="">6:37</a>Me during exams
Why is the interviewers vocie and sound is much LOUDER than Shahrukh????????????????????????????????????

<a href="">#black</a>

i think shahrukh is better entertaining as a person than actor.

He is funnier than everyone there 

Badshah Shah Rukh Khan 
Love you SRK

Still waiting for the wedding skit! 

SRK the last stage of personality development ️

The busy waitress fundamentally soak because religion undoubtedly calculate despite a lowly chance. burly, imported rayon

Srk great personality ️
U know I have to say a room filled with comedians and I died laughing because of shah .he not only has great intelligence skills but brill dialect intellect as <a href="">well.love</a> u 

Our roast is going on
Lol what about the wedding play??? Been 4years.

Such a lighter side of SRK. This was damn good!!

now that I&#39;m watching this in 2021, did you guys actually do a wedding show with Shahrukh Khan

Man shahrukh is god

Good schooling, Hansraj alumni, sportsman in his teenage and good parenting matters. SRK is properly educated person that why he stands out of these uneducated so called stars.Srk is the true star. Greatest of our generation.

SRK ️ and AIB
Wedding show???????

Hey when is wedding show coming ????

What is this account brother...it talks a lot
Srk is our true king
shah rukh khan is such a bitch

You know why shahrukh is not the best comedian in india ?? Because , his profession says he&#39;s a actor !!!!

Still waiting for that wedding skit....

srk is basically the jhonny depp of bollywood

Srk
<a href="">15:16</a> Well that came out really well.

From all the things that God has blessed Shahrukh Khan with, his wit and wisdom are truly admirable. KING FOR A REASON!

srk: lets do one wedding show.well that didn&#39;t age well.

His Interviews are more intellectual than his movies.

from Collab with srk to collab with chutiya like gareeb ,fleet etc

Plz di podcast with Michael Jackson

I was trying to count the awards️

&quot;Farhan toh is out&quot;, 
throughout the podcast i was like srk is going to drop the mug..

The one where AIB got roasted

I wanted to know did really demonitization affected Shahrukh khan

All the comedians are sitting like they are in their own house and only Shahrukh is sitting with manners

I love you Srk
When a strong personality meet Big Personality... LMAO 

SRK has so much to talk,,you will be ended hearing till night,,, LMAO ... He&#39;s very selfaware &amp; has always something to reply..Very genuinely &amp; inteligently.

<a href="">8:58</a> didn’t age well. We are scared to scream right now.  @Tanmaybhat

&quot;Award functions r like satsang

<a href="">5:40</a> man - this part alone makes me want  to see srk do stand up comedy

Guys please please do another one with Shahrukh

Shah Rukh Khan gives better interviews than films

I looove youuuu SRK
Still waiting for that wedding show

About the biscuit add they should have asked him not to eat anything for 12 hrs and when you are hungry  feeling come automatically.

Still waiting for THE Wedding show

I&#39;m glad AIB is done for good.

<a href="">5:18</a> i see QURAN  love u shahrukh
This wedding play is about to happen..I have been waiting for 4 years..
SRK KING OF HEARTS 
Arrey yaar revive this man, buy Khamba out (with that mamaearth money) if that is what it takes

Srk ️
<a href="">15:16</a> did shahrukh just predicted that 

I&#39;m not a fan because I&#39;m such a big star Sun got hurt 

His vanity is secret of his success.

He&#39;s being an ahole slightly 

I am drink....or else...it chutiya sir....but truly...I like you for being true...best of luck sir

Chitiya....

<a href="">17:25</a> and he does the vimal add (jubaa kesri)

Everybody: SRK sense of humour

MAN THE BOOKS ON THE TABLE MADE MY DAY. <a href="">07:44</a>

3 years after.....Still waiting for SRK Shaadi skit!

Well well see the ironyHere after the VIMAL ad

It is true that BS VIMAL's ad should not be done.
And just like fifa,the wedding show never happened.......

They should be happy I&#39;m not stealing the bride away... Killed it.

Been 4 years still waiting for the wedding show...

First time ever, no time to read comments bcz enjoying every second of srk conversation...By the way i stop video to write cmnt

<a href="">21:17</a> I guess the wedding show plan is still in progress!!!!

SRK is wittiest actor ever in Bollywood!

<a href="">#likepathan</a> trailer

Waiting for that wedding show

Anyone during pandemic ?
Actor friend with padded room is Anil Kapoor 

Yaha srk ​​comedians ko haas rahe hai 
Best brand ambassador ever..... legend️
How much has you eaten?
@<a href="">15:32</a> Faruqui?
Srk :- &quot;my house is too small&quot;Me :- &quot;bhaijaan, apka living room ka area mein mera do flat hain&quot;

Why r Indians so obsessed with Meryl Streep?

Sharukh is the best always my fav️

I wonder how in the world could Srk not drop or even shake the cup of coffee that is just beside his elbow and hands and even throughout his hands goes over and side to it. Crazy man. It&#39;s like know throughout how his body gonna react. And plus he has mastered the art of handling his body as he has done with acting.

Arrey bhai sharukh sir ka samne too apna (fuck) wala baat  ban karo orr sirr bolo yaar. He is the king of india you all pity vulgar speaker comedian

Hi. Want to know details of that book named MUHAMMAD right on front of the table? Anyone knows please tell me?

What a man! What charisma! What authenticity! The BEST ever! PS. Once a SRKian, always a SRKian! ️

I have lost the count of the number of times i have eatched srk podcast

SRK saying mannat is too small..Dil se bura laga..

After watching Sandeep sir kon yha aaya hai my youtube channel [Common Guruji] for trick study

It&#39;s been 4 years and we still didn&#39;t get that skit

People calling aib india’s top comedians . Like are you brain dead.
Rakshit: This is SRK's house? Me: Nai Nai Rakshit: No one among us will be able to flicker!
<a href="">8:17</a> This is a sequence from Jab harry met sejal!

Its 2021 and Still waiting.

srk is love

Legend has it that SRK still hasn&#39;t invited these guys for a wedding and world tour

I thought I was in Mannat for the whole conversation

When is the wedding show with SRK coming, AIB?

That&#39;s the guy from Welcome to Bijus Classes I&#39;m from Mexico and I know him because the advertisement in the apps I use!

IT&#39;S BEEN 4 YEARS NOW SINCE SRK PROMISED AIB FOR A WEDDING SHOW, WHEN IS THE SHOW COMING?..............IS IT TOO GONNA END LIKE THE FIFA NIGHT XDXD
&quot;I&#39;m not a fan because I&#39;m such a big star&quot;- Thug Life 

and here i am again!!!

Srk Srk Srk ️️
Srk Alone Removed all the Bakchodi of All India Bakchod.

SRK can make anyone nervous and insecure. Come on you all! We all have been seeing him for so long on the big screen. These guys were actually not as comfortable as they usually are. Most importantly you can&#39;t actually roast a big star like all the other guests cause that will make things really awkward.

Legends say the wedding scripts is still going on

Why aib shuts up ? Kya hua waise

Why was Biswa looking like Raju Rastogi&#39;s papa!!

N then I noticed a Harry Potter book in the shelf

Am I the only one who was constantly worried ki woh Cup na gir jaaye ............XD

Wedding show........... sad

Four times, six times
Still waiting for shahrukh wedding sketch with AIB

Punches are okay but I truly hate the fake laugh culture

Messi has called ronaldo srk a lot more..srk like bande messi ronaldo ke drivers hote hai
Still waiting for the Weeding Show in 2021!

<a href="">17:48</a>

Fears that congress supporters might get offended&quot;Don&#39;t compare me with our honourable ex PM.&quot;Remembers that this might offend BJP supporterd&quot;I am not that silent.&quot; 

S Khan made it painfully obvious to Shakya he wasn&#39;t welcome as part of these interactions and that he considers him not worthy of his company. A douchebag is what Khan is!!

<a href="">10:05</a> Did he just said &quot;This house is too small&quot; (Mannat) LOL....

Shahrukh sleeps on the right side of the bed

THE MOST APPRECIATED LEGEND
Meryl Streep is the biggest hypocrite of Hollywood

The fact is.. as u go on watching this podcast.. ur love for Shahrukh grows even more.. ️.. this Man defines a lot of things.. Respect

Wooooow SRK is such an actor. This is not the man I saw in Wankhede stadium lol

&quot;Konsa king, konsa bollywood &quot; that part 
I could sit &amp; listen to this guy all day &amp; night. Fascinating &amp; so humourous.

This was amazing. Loved it.

Anyone noticed the same furniture, now in Tanmay&#39;s room

<a href="">0:15</a> lost weight

Is it shahrukh&#39;s house

who was sharuk talking about (padded room).

Send fry
Ashish had FOMO in the entire interview

21:4 most savage moment of SRK ..... GLAD THAT I AM NOT STEALING THE BRIDE

AIB was there when you did roast, G khamba! The firm was hardly 6 months old, maybe!!

Srk said his house has been broken.
Ban gaya wedding show? 
A man just overshadowed 4 people who are comedians! That&#39;s just King things the last king Bollywood&#39;s ever gonna have cause&#39; no one can match that level 

Sharukhan prasing himself for <a href="">30:29</a> mins straight ️
He is funny, but I don&#39;t feel like he is that great a person, like he can give back to the people more, he doesn&#39;t do much charities too

I MISS THESE PODCASTSSSSBRING THEM BACK, TAKE THIS AS A SIGN
either I am turned very old /maturity struck or else they are hyped comedians. I laugh at one of their 500 jokes. What&#39;s the reason they laugh? damn

Why does srk&#39;s shirt has holes?

You guys really made it big

Good thing that AIB didnt ask <b>Aap Aam kaise khaate hai?</b>

Srk is behaving like a gentleman but man this teen has behaved like a dog for a while now it hurts my ears
<a href="">15:23</a> &quot;It&#39;s on the downslide, it&#39;s not over&quot; YET

I Neva watch his movies... But apart of his movies... He z super fun person 

This is mannat for suree*️️️ his house
This man is just awesome ️ srk 

<a href="">5:26</a>

What was the meryl Streep stuff?

Salman &gt; Shahrukh
I died laughing. But on a serious note this is the problem of entire country. If celebrities speak they will be branded as anti-national, liberandus or even bhakts, or sell out. Even if they decide not to speak publicly then also public would assume that so called celebrity is keeping a mum. Nd that&#39;s very true at present moment. It&#39;s totally relatable

Watching this and feeling weird. A dead group interviewing a man on whom my crush has died. So much death and agony lol

This was the year when IIFA made fun of great actor sushant ..ha ha iifa..Peddlers buy that shit..

53rd Time and still doesn&#39;t get old

The man is well over his head. We can see through his dark facade.

You did one roast and your carer is over Well it&#39;s not over......After one year ..................

Those who&#39;re saying that SRK overshadowed AIB forget that SRK overshadows the entire Bollywood.King for a reason.

Look at the awards. I&#39;m mesmerized

shahrukh is such a cool guy, I wish he displays this real carefree attitude in his future movies and not be caught up in the commercial way he has.... so far.

<a href="">#giveshahrukhalltheawards</a>

He truly deserves to be the KING of Bollywood...... He will always be

I&#39;d empty my account for an SRK standup special

Any one 2020 december

<a href="">6:19</a>  konsa king

i have watched podcast 2 times in the past today i was searching for srk interview this was on the list so when the fuck will that wedding show with shah rukh will happen  i m missing all aib bakchodis broo , i m very emotional while writing this please do something and get back the things which you guys were good at and make that wedding show fucking possible with SRK dude  2020 already sucks bhenchod chutiya saal . Kuch toh acha ho mere liye ye saal me

THAT LINE FROM SRK️ 14.47 “THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE FUN OF THEMSELVES ARE THE MOST CONFIDENT”
ok biswa is looking like a just shaved testicle

best line by tanmay bhatt to sharukh khan -&quot;sharukh did demonetization affect you&quot; sharukh started laughing on the sofa

Bc Sharukh Khan ke ghar nikkar mein ???
DID THEY DO THE MARRIAGE SKIT

Every line is so witty at so many levels, no doubt he&#39;s the KING! Totally overshadowed the others

<a href="">
You alone are equal to everyone else 10000 times.
The biscuit part is seriously the best !! I keep coming back for that

Mannn when he narrated the Biscuit story.. phenomenal guy he is

It&#39;s Shahrukh House
Loved to see The Holy Qur&#39;an in Shah Rukh sir&#39;s house

Why are these guys sitting with their legs up on the couch

Love you srk 
Still waiting for the wedding show with srk 

King khan - SRK

When Biswa was bald 

Who is here after Tanmay Story

King Khan
Tanmay OP 
<a href="">15:18</a> it&#39;s over.&quot;AIB&quot;

Let&#39;s be honest, you came from Tanmay&#39;s story

Tanmay&#39;s swipe up anyone ???

Youtube forgot to recommend me this today so Tanmay did the job :)

Here from the story 

Tanmay OP hbd SRK
<a href="">15:18</a> In 2020 Tanmay: Hey shahrukh Watsupp
Why are these 4 guys dressed so badly and looking so ugly ? They could have dressed neatly while going to meet SRK. Even SRK told them that they look ugly.

SRK: My House is too small. My House: Toh mein kya karun? Mar jaun?

I just love SRK veins showing through neck n face...️️

Arrogant,  Self Absorbed,  overconfidence, excessive pride -- SRK
Still waiting for the wedding play lmao

Before ranveer singh and tiger shroff, he was the most energetic actor back in the day

Check out our podcast, if you’re not triggered easily.

The king has no replacement still these days...SRK has a golden personality..️️️

Khamba say Hello...missing those words

My favorite video of aib

Is it too difficult to balance sound in your videos for your audience ? With all the money you are making from users ?.....if that&#39;s not possible , just stop laughing that loud.

<a href="">#GiveSharukhAllTheAwards</a>

ok ok I apologize if you were upset but I wanted you to help me and you know that everyone has a mentality and the mentality This is very once again I apologize if I upset you I know I know it&#39;s hard that I kept sending messages that I will try to avoid your apologies and look for someone else to help me

SRK and interview is better than almost every recent Bollywood movies

Ek England ka wicket keeper pta nahi kya kar raha hai shayad park mein teahlne aaya tha , pitch pe hei dance kari jaa raha hai. par koi naa dusra wicket keeper toh apna kaam bkhubhi dhang se nibhaa raha hai &quot;Jos Buttler 77(54)&quot;.2nd T20i : AUS                   ENG              157/7 (20)      158/4(18.5)Series is already with England but , One match still left , And I am almost sure Australia will not let England to whitewash the series , 2 predictions of mine already wrong , but this time it will be correct , Supporting Australia

Every Time you learn something from his interviews is a treat

Time stops when Shahrukh laughs

I am here on 2020 

Amazing  absolutely love this!!!!! Shah Rukh Khan is amazing...  AIB guys pretty funny too. thanks!!!

I&#39;m not a fan cause I&#39;m a big star
Shah rukh Khan has called you for fifa

It’s over now though

Warning : don&#39;t take name of bajirav mastani in front of SRK

This is me @<a href="">5:30</a> during winter baths

Shahrukh is actually the main host of aib podcast

Sushant's death left you feeling like this.....
Hey brother, what do you want to achieve by joining forces...now brother, your time is over in Bollywood.
Srk reaction change every word. OmgSome Actor not changing reaction whole movie

The Badshah of Bollywood -Shah Rukh Khan️

I wonder abhi tak wedding show ka skit hua ki nhi

the guy in the red t shirt doesn&#39;t speak at all .. why do they have him in the room .

The way they are talking to him, the way they are sitting, the way they are using words like Yaar etc ... its didn&#39;t feel good...zyada western banne ki koshish kar rahe hai...They should have some respect for such a legendary and veteran actor..

<a href="">

sound quality is verry bad

When will wedding show will happen with SHAH RUKH KHAN ?

You guys can never be boring,, I wish you guys be one group again soon..

I don&#39;t why Sharuk is always so self obbssesed about he is King of Bollywood?

The biscuit ad incident was hilarious 

Podcast would have been same without Ashish shakhya

Please wedding show krlo..

<a href="">

Dear AIB,  I have been waiting for wedding night and World tour video for the last three years. Please come back and entertain us.

so it&#39;s 2020 and there&#39;s not been  the wedding show they talked about.

Shahrukh didn&#39;t overshadow them, they respected him as their senior who they respect, whereas with Ranbir who is of their age, they treated him as a friend and colleague.

Brush your hair you look so dirty!!
<a href="">5:31</a> IS ADORABLE

You have to speak so much English and without talking you still have to eat it.
Shahrukh is such a sport and what wit he has ... woww... totally overshadowed all the aib peeeps

3yrs old and im Still here

COME BACK AIB WE MISSS YOUUUUUU

Well srk has harry potter book 

They were right about the career going downside.

rip&#39;&#39;

Pls comeback AIB

Fuck u srk
Miss you guys. Please come back

Anyone noticed Shahrukh&#39;s tattoo

Which roast is srk talking at <a href="">15:34</a>

When will the wedding show happen?

The levels of narcissism on this guy!!!

<a href="">27:06</a>

The person in the paded room is salman right now

Looloo Lemon &amp; Juicy 
Till now wedding play video has not been made with SRK! 3 years gone by brother
No one can get bored even after listening to Shahrukh Khan!!
SRK Rocks

Behind watching the vid legends were counting total filmfare

Sharukh is awesome and he know it

Genuine KING 
SRK has real job only when there’s function in Ambanis house.

All the human scientists are here 
I would almost go into depression if I had to face even one failure 
If nothing happened according to my account then I would almost throw a phase on myself 
I am very sensitive and if you do not support me then you will kill me 
 Abey bhai, why don't you do such a good job, why are you leaving me in the backyard? What is the purpose of your life? 
That's it, Gaye has started opening the doors of my misunderstanding with the power of his awareness.
Thats y he is bollywood king.....always in love with you SRK

Fuck filmfare manFilmfare doesnt deserve you !
&quot;I am such a big star, how can I be someone else&#39;s fan&quot; This guy has my heart for his interviews only. 

And I fell in love with him all over again ️

Can you mute your mikes if you are wearing while laughing??  It&#39;s so irritating...
