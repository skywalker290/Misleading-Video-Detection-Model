Who is here after watching Chandni mimic&#39;s video

This interview is from the time of dear life
Iska Girl crush - deepika  And boy crush - ranbir kapoor Wow

Interviewer is laughing alot fr no reason

When she is being herself it’s called ‘over reacting’ when she is chill and quite she is ‘fake’ and ‘wannabe Kareena’ Let her be guys!

Amazing
I don’t know why I just can’t hate this girl for anything. She is a blessed one I guess.

Y don&#39;t anyone ask abt her father&#39;s acts tht ain&#39;t gyd

Y do thy all pamper hr alot

The double standards of filmfare, they ask Katrina how she feels about Alia dating Ranbir but never asked Alia the same question!

She is an amazing actor for sure but what stands her out is her easygoing, happy, innocent, unfiltered, confident in her own world kind of living that make her enduring. She is also warm and loving around her colleagues in industry. Amazing girl!

She has gotten best education from papa Karan about how to be kajol and kareena... She is trying to prove it. She is very gud at these things 

honestly I can&#39;t bear the way she talks!

<a href="">14:50</a> katrina saying this same to alia

Cutest girl in the world. Love you so much Alia

she is the only girl who have a girl crush on her boyfriend&#39;s ex girlfriend

How much ever she tries to look hot she can never look hot.. She looks Musculine.. Just by wearing a shirt and buliding body like men doesn&#39;t make look hot

Aalia is a best product from nepotism

Nice

She&#39;s sooo gorgeous ️️
accent is so thick

She is so beautiful loving innocent..natural a n honest an so pure at heatt..i hope ranbir dont jist take her  fror granted because of his past..he needs to show her much mor e love

ranbir aila is best couples

Now i can see why filmfare always post alia pics more 

Happiness family toomamjiandsirji

Be original Alia 

why this interviewer talks like a girl???Mard ho to mard i tarah bolo....

Dumb alia<a href="">#copycat</a>

such an annoying girl

Please bring Shradha Kapoor. We luvv her ️

So cute

Oh God Alia sooooooooooooo cuteness Actaress

Alia bhatt my lifeline 
Alia bhatt Bollywood queen blockbuster machine forever

Alia for taliya 

Alia super blockbuster machine
Alia is moistly greatest actaress

Love you alooo all much

Most of these interviewers are so cringey.

Alia is overacting 
Jitesh pillai looks like momos and also a creepy fellow

That&#39;s the worst thing about Northern India road trips or bike trips..You won&#39;t find a washroom even after miles of miles.. You&#39;ll find it only at Dhabas that too unhygienic..so bush and a bottle of water will do better job..Only Ladkah is full of washrooms here and there..and Southern part, Maharashtra,Goa,Gujrat, Northeastern part is full of washrooms that too hygienic..Edit: I think Alia should attempt &quot;Tamanna&quot; instead..

She&#39;s looking sp cute

U are saying randeep about smelling the least good.. btw highway was his screenplay.. he worked so hard to deliver the best performance.. no one could have done it more better then him.. perhaps should start seeing that part instead of sayings things that arent nice

The entire new generation - Alia, Ananya, Sara etc etc all of then idolize Kareena and that is very stupid

She tries to copy Everything of deepika

Aloo so cute and natural 

My word of advice to you haters is move on with your life.. I am sure that if you haters find yourself in the same room with her, you will never be able to repeat these disgusting comments of yours.. alia

Useless interviews are done by this guy ..completely useless.......

So I thought a question came to my mind that will these people keep acting normal and will they punch me? I am a bit sad.
Both r bubbly
Your eyes sexy

I wonder why comment section is full of hatred.let her be guys. This is the way she is!!!let her enjoy

Y not kangana ranaut on the show?

best interview ,totally frank

I love her!

Ranbir’s present girlfriend’s “girl crush” is his “ex deepika” niceee 
Atleast for the next five years, she should forget about Bollywood and focus on doing Southern movies(Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada).She had the potential to be a Jennifer Lawrence but her acting is falling into a monotone(Gully Boy, Sadak 2). She needs to save her career ASAP.I have seen some films(Shandaar, Raazi,Dear Zindagi, Gully Boy, Udta Punjab) in theater and some in OTT(SOTY, Kapoor &amp; Sons,BKD, HKD).She needs to save herself from being typecast and should come out of her comfort zone in terms of roles.

Her voice is so irritating gosh

Shraddha Kapoor is so much better than her in all the aspects

The interview with Kareena was the best imo

Omg! She&#39;s sooo cute , I love her 


The whole b town does not know anything but just to apply objectionable terms in their statements...brainless, aimless nincompoops are only good at character assasination of the talented actors...boycott these stupid talentless and unknowledgable people

Soooooo cute alia

Even the way she rolls her lips is just kareena, her subconscious is conquered by her idol...

Alia is pretty without a joke

Aila 1 actor and I love you too baby girl and I love you too baby girl and I love you too baby girl and ️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Aliya z showing much acting i dnt no y so cheapest
alia bhatt peed on streets

Sidalia
I feel like she’s copying kareena

She’s soooo cute ️
Aila ️
This interview of Alia is full of her cute expressions, You&#39;ll see an expression of her at every sec of this video. No doubt she is the cutest. But an over actor at the same time especially over here. But she&#39;s my favorite. Lol!

Wow. So rude. He just cut the interview when it was his turn. What the hell!!!

Alia is best.

ALIA
I really hate tiny face alia 

Ugh!  Terrible!

She is cast in sadak 2 now

Kangana 
Unprofessional  she Is

My dear bro and sis.....when ever your feel depressed pls watch the interviews of aliah Bhatt and FM NIRMALA SEETHA RAMAN best COMEDIANS IN THE WORLD....

Aalll iiiaaa haram tatttti shakalll kii ghatttiiiyyaa oraatt marjjjaaa nalayakk nallliii m jaakarrr
Ohmygo I can feel Kareena Kapoor &#39;lurking&#39; in the air 

Smelling nepotism.....as they got job in khairat...with her annoying talks..

C cool

definition of media = A place where hate spreads fast in the name of freedom of expression and opinion. geeeszz!! Let&#39;s be good people  to  make  the world a better place.

Y most of the b town male hosts following same strategyWacky

she is very smart and witty. well done Alia, thoroughly enjoyed it.

Dayan alia
Hate her all the way

What was this an interview or a flirt sesh?

Cheek cheek ke na bol, cheek cheek k.
Sound just like Ananya panday
ALIA BHATT should be banned in bollywood.She is a SUPER idiot.Worst product of nepotism.I take an oath not to watch any ALIA BHATT MOVIE IN MY LIFE EVER.

Bimbo

Cheap Karan Johar
Please tell me why I was actually expecting a sensible conversation about Cinema

Who is alia......I know only shushant sir
Inarticulate, immature and stupid, but thinks she&#39;s so cool. SMH

Who is she?

She is a crazy woman...who has killed a snake...!!!!
Very good actress Alia

Alia does not belong on the industry tbh. She is too pure for such a filthy industry

What&#39;s with this accent?

Why do all actresses fake themselves while with this guy? I dont even!

Good

Giteshhhh plz show some dignity man!!

Loved it

How cute.....

This guy has asked..do this certificate!
Famous Actress, Aliya Bhatt, one Interview,

I think Jitesh Pillai destroyed Filmfare. He stole the beauty and magic to the magazine and the awards, making it a money making factory.

she is cute but...don&#39;t know why she has always denoted Randeep as a not so up there person in every way which is completely annoying...come on girl! he is an amazing actor and good looking as well..

She soo natural love you ️️Alia ️️
why is she talking like an aunty man? where’s the class gone Aloo?

same i love men perfume
She&#39;s so beautiful and herself. She doesn&#39;t pretend to be someone else and that&#39;s the beauty of Alia Bhatt.

he is such a bore, really sucks plus the format the way they shot the show is really annoying.....watching his back is really painful

Khud ki dumb joke me khud hi hasti hai ???So irritating
Who the fuck talks like this ?

I never seen her growing same face same body nothing changed in ten years

I m really sorry to say but Alisa why are you behaving like a kid.. you are 26/27... Behave like women.. why this kind of irritating nautanky.stop copying others. Learn how to speak 1st. Your interviews are getting irritating day by day.. LOL

Watch Ca CS foundation students <a href="">

Karan Johar and Kareena Kapoor ️
I dnt know why Indians hate Alia too much? Here in Pakistan youth love Alia more then anyother actress of bollywood. She is jus outspoken but at the same time she is hot, childish and looks adorable with the dimples.

Her teeth are TERRIBLE

Alia stop fakin ... you are such a annoying person ! You were such a fake friend to kat

Hello ️I also have a Youtube channel<a href=""> check OutHope you guys like itDo Subscribe ️

Fabulous

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Love alia

he is auntyyy yr mohale wali

Intro music is definitely a copy from another youtube channel - simplynailogical

She talks a lot like kareena kapoor. Need to get her own style when she talks.

Alia vat is so quet

Alia u r a cutest girl

Radhe Radhe Alia bhatt

Radhe Radhe

Radhakrishna
Radhakrishna
The boy is just a feminine ferson plz don’t keep Him he is so irritating 

Aliya ji, before you get married, you have to have a love affair with Ranbir for a year, where Katrina did not do it.
Alia Ranvir's couple is not matching yet, Bhutt Sahab, it will take a lot of time to get her married.
Dear friend, now, I m talking about movie.

Alia is overacting

She has a influence of Kareena on herself now... Kinda.......She sounds like her a little 

She&#39;s adorable 
And this is what six months old video! So KatRan still on!  <del>Unkool</del>

I don&#39;t know why but I am hating this man. Sorry man 

She looks like a kid

I got a headache from her, leaving the page! Sorry

Alia is so cute ugh how to handle this cuteness?????

No majesh bhatt no soni rajdan loook like energetic but aliya full of positively energetic is aliya is daughter of both or adopted frm kashmir

To me she is kind of sounding like Ananya Pandey 

Ranbir
Strange way of conversation

What kind of camerawork is that?  I am so uncomfortable.

Totally kareena 

# ALIA ROCKS, love u alia
da fuck is he asking!!!

Hahah this is another quote of mahesh bhatt

Alia ... very talented you already have your place in Bollywood... Why this over acting and pretending to be cute?

Let&#39;s just say she is ok (so so) and lucky. Definitely better actress than Deepika. Deepika just can&#39;t act. Katrina is so muchhhhh talented actress than Alia. But, no one can take Kareena&#39;s place, Kareena is superb actress.

Average looking, dumb and v irritating. Wouldn’t have stood a chance hadn’t she been mahesh bhatt’s daughter

You know what’s the host name..Chattuu..

I'm not a chakka h bc
lol friend hooks up with your bf.... just look yourself

She has got over energetic ..

Alia is so fun

Oh My God....His voice is so annoying.

he is so irritating

After Vidya.Rani and Kangana... Alia Bhatt is the most telented acteress in <a href="">bollywood.In</a> Higthway,raazi,udta punjab,dear zindagi her performances were great

Alia is so cuteeeeeeeee

Alia speaks slowly otherwise it&#39;ll difficult  for the people to get wht u r saying.

<a href="">12:38</a> Was she talking about Ranbir???

Could you ask a question worse than &quot;Do you wear men&#39;s perfume ?&quot; Get some content people -_-

She is so fake

This interview is so fun

To all those who are commenting against her, mates she knows her job damn well. Doing a film like highway at the beginning of one&#39;s career is not easy.. Playing Kaira was not easy. She just lived that character. She&#39;s done justice to Sehmat&#39;s character. She is an actress. She can act. And this is only a fun chat. Don&#39;t degrade anyone. She&#39;s genuinely a good person. And no she doesn&#39;t talk like thisTo Filmfare, don&#39;t do this to stars. Conversation like these degrade actors. Do some creative and informative convo.

Y do I feel bored..
Wanted to be an actress since i was in my mothers womb the level of dumbness in this statement says that a bollywood actor is speaking.

Alia herself admits that Deepika is prettier.

10 years ago she was 13? But she&#39;s 26 now so technically 10 years back she was 16. Alia please do your math right.

This man talk so creepy thing nd the way he look at every actress is very cheap..

When she talks about Sidharth is like she wants to cry or something <a href="">9:08</a>

Finally she admited Sadak 2 was sugested by Sidharth, 1 point to the 

Lol we got second sister of Sonam Kapoor,over acting even out of movie..  tooo!

I am a good chef if u open restaurant please hire me alia i will work free of cost for u only.......

Nice Alia mam. Ik. Apke. Sat. Pic. Lena. Hai
Everyone has a crush on deepika 

Its funny how ppl complaining not to understand the convo reasons between two of them... i mean, was it supposed to b a nuclear deal between alia n interviewer or a summit o something....why is it so complicated for them to understand 

I don’t think she is over acting. She is just in a good mood!!

Aaliya sooooo cute
Wtf did I watch

Alia ,you are beautiful  than cheepika

Yeh itna fast zyada bolti hai i find her exhausting she never stops talking

I hate her .. Such a wanna be actor. Copying kareena and doing overacting on top of it.

Y&#39;all need to chill. Alia is just like every other young girl. Love her.

<a href="">3:01</a> I loved her reaction

Me to alia ko dekh k hi khush ho jata hu 

Omg she’s so cute ️
I cringe looking at her huge faces
Y she is faking so much, alia chill yar. This is not ur last day of ur life.

Why again she is changing her behavior from tough to bubbly huffffff i find her exhausting never stops talking

Why again she is changing her behavior from tough to bubbly huffffff i find her exhausting never stops talking

Face badan malai jaisa cute Alooo what expression interview I Love you ️️️️  My Gf My LifeMeri Aloo ️ Pooo Pet Name very nice
Who thinks she&#39;s feigning to please more fans? She&#39;s crazy ought to be locked up

Thanks for her contributions to industry,, we would have no one to laugh at... I don&#39;t understand surprisingly whats wrong achanak se... She is only talking,, but only real human can see the shocking truth 

Alia's movements are very fast, her weight is bari
(haniya Aamir) is way better then her..

I hate when these young actors take legends names without respect. They should learn from Sara Ali Khan...she takes elders name in a very respectful way

some how she is fake there is something fake in her

sorry .. but i just cant bear her...

Bakwas alia sraddha natural beauty

Why lot of people are saying they are fake and stuff. They are not, creative people are like that only, they talk loud and talk with expressions and have lot of energy. Everyone keep thinking fake, no it’s real

Look another nepotistic interview

Lots of love to alia

why is the host talking like a child??

Stop copying Kareena ...alia be yourself and stop being <a href="">annoying.you</a> are pain to ears...why making faces and speaking so fast.. annoying

Alia sirf ek advice desakti hy apne best friend ke boyfriend ko kyse patana, isske andar thodasa bhi dignity hy ya nahi, stupid girl, tum kyse apne friend se nazre milaogi

So annoying the way they speak

Stop for air Alia

cute girl
HOST  is so IRRITATING

Jitesh is the male version of SAROJ KHAN . He speaks exactly  same the way the saroj Khan speaks.

This guy definitely made Alia uncomfortable at some point. Why such fuck all questions to be asked?

Plz replace the host

Allia she is my wi

Seamless fleired with Allia

Very friendly interview, its like two frns r talking

Your so beautiful your voice I&#39;m big fan of yours

Cool

Tell tell tell tell...

Alia ️️
Dolna

@<a href="">19:27</a> what word did she use? Is it &#39;Righteous&#39;?

Alia is like a overactting

Copying Kareena left, right and center in the way she speaks and makes faces and then says I am not like Kareena. Please applaud the &#39;Hypocrite of the year&#39;.

Why Alia wants to show this fkng reactions!

Alia 
Next part?
Does He decide who gets the award??

Baby filmfare

So Btfl Alia

The advertisement was so good

<a href="">12:26</a>

He is gay for sure

Hi

What cheesy person yaar!!. Yeh kaise sawaal hai!!

Bacche bhi is aadmi se badiya interview lete 

Alia Bhatt = pretentious and irritating

Why we see some similarities between kareena n her coz alia always copied her acting and I always felt this.

I have no idea why I’m here. Haven’t watched her movies too, just that seen her pictures many times. I didn’t know she talks like this. I’m so turned off. ️

I don&#39;t know why people hate Alia bhatt just because karan is her friend and she is a nepo kid?? Look there are lots of nepo kids in our industry, shradha, sara ali khan, ananya, jahnvi, ishan, ranbir, varun ,athiya shetty and many more, so why people trigger alia bhatt, atleast between the age of 20-30 she is the finest actress we have. Films like raazi, udta punjab, dear zindagi, highway.. Dekha nahi kya, aaj jo kuch bhi he woh apni talent ki wajah se he, nahi toh baki k nepo kids itne famous kyu nhi he and shradha kapoor ki sirf aashique 2 k alawa koi bhi film hit nhi hui, toh itna kaiko problem he Alia bhatt se??

She is a backstabber to Katrina

Irritating

6 20 she said pariminder instead of parameshwar pariminder is sid&#39;s manager

Now its her turn to be in Depression.



I love Kangana
Till now I have a question who are Kardashians? Who are they and what they do?

The way she speaks and the way her face gets crushed... Verrrrry irritating!Varun Dhavan... Even if he gives 100 takes... Kya farak padne wala hai

<a href="">

Too much of fakeness

She&#39;s so comfortable in her skin... that&#39;s a striking similarity with Kareena.

Wats so funny about ab k baras‍️
Why is Alia shouting?

Liked alia for teh frst time dunno y she seemed so cute

Alia sid say shadi karloo
Alia plssssss.... U r way more beautiful than Deepika. Shez jus a sculpted face. People didn&#39;t adore her from beginning of career. N if u think that for her tallness. There many yesteryear actresses most pretty with your height.It&#39;s true..Pls don&#39;t underestimate your self, you are superlative in beauty n talent. U jus need to improve your dancing skills.Pls never stare if u c deepika again

So lame
notanki actress with  childesh host

How to view the full episodes? Guys help

Alia on love what does she would know about love ,falling in love with a guy who has failed in every relationship that he had in past that too long term relationship .he is such a bad example when in comes to love.although a good actor.Alia on the other hand will surely grow out of this relationship in 5 yrs.get married with ranbir and then get divorced end of story

&quot;was back stabbed by her friend who hooked up with her boyfriend&quot; sounds similar no? She makes me like Katrina Kaif lmao

what&#39;s with his tharkiness

No hate but she acts so fake bubbly though. It’s kinda annoying

Alia hs turned all NAQLEEFake realllly.Shr s a ok actressJus got lucky wd scripted muvis jus like Vicky kaushal

I hate this host

Overdose of pretending cuteness. Irritating

Alia is everything hahahah makes me laughed so much

very annoying interviewer

Pillai: do you feel any Similarity between u and Kareena??Alia: NOOOO(in Kareena&#39;s way)

Alia is my fvrt

Very creepy Jitesh is...

Come on stop behaving the Kareena

For some reasons I don’t like Alia bhatt at all and for some reasons I never likes rabbit kapoor as well

What happened to indian beautyShe is so ugly

Jitesh Pillai: Creepy!! How can anyone even laugh over such sleazy questions!! He sucks!!

This is by far the most fun interview

I thought Renil Abraham of zoom is most disgusting and then i see Jitesh Pillai. Why u have to be THARKI to be an interviewer?

<a href="">16:46</a> ALIA -- whenever I look at Deepika I just wanna stay and look at herRANBIR -- Am I a joke to you??

Wannabe Karan Johar with wannabe Kareena Kapoor.... as if we needed two more legends like them in this world. No wonder Kangana hates these people... they must be so annoying off camera too!

Watch *1.25

Ye kya journalist hai..tell tell tell tell  entertainment sector needs more articulated journalists who don&#39;t complete their sentences with naaa

Alia Bhatt you are so cute... I like the way you were shying out in some questions.. it&#39;s super adorable.

alia pls learn to do the interviews from Taapsee! jeez, she&#39;s so irritating!! i seriously got no clue on what this convo was all about!!!!

<a href="">

hizda hai kya

Very very talented actress Alia Bhatt Bollywood queen

Bored of seen this vedix add...

the interviewer is coming too close to alia while talking. why cant he sit straight

What&#39;s eating I don&#39;t understand can anyone tell me ???

It&#39;s irritating conversation . lacks everything. How anyone can listen more than few minutes. Esp this mota he he all-time blood sucking...and Alia u need to add content also than makeup and style. It&#39;s boredom . Next time don&#39;t just give interview for the sake of interview and mota don&#39;t take interview for sake of interview

They takd demselves too seriously...

This fucking madrasi (keralian) bastard  makes me get up and slap somebody

Interviewer is so full of cringe, it&#39;s not fun at all. And Alia&#39;s immature behaviour is not at all charming any more. She has this irritating switch between fake accent and Indian accent which is idiotic. She is hugely overrated because there are very less good actresses of her age. I appreciated her in highway and that&#39;s all.

the traffic

Alia bhatt is so talented  actress lv u alia  
She&#39;s soooo beautiful 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
<a href="">16:43</a> Girl Crush : Deepika Padukone 
To much make-up and too much attitude

Alia speaks like Karan except with way less vocabulary

Alia is all copying Kareena Kapoor. Too pretentious.

The host is becoming nasty

Srk

watch at 0.75x It will sound normal

Interview tara sutaria
Alia is trying to be funny ..

Alia Bhatt is perfect for twilight Bollywood remake for Bella swan of Kristen Stewart

<a href="">13:13</a> &#39; <a href="">13:35</a> I&#39;m laughing watching them laugh 
Alia sounds so fake man!!!!

Call Shreya Ghoshal in your show.

Alia is 23?? She said in 2017 that she is about to turn 24

How do you not understand why people call you &quot;baby kareena&quot;? It&#39;s like she&#39;s there in the interview talking through you. 

I don&#39;t like alia anymore...

She talks in a wannabe manner. She should take lessons from Sara Ali Khan .

Alia 
Alia kb to bachi rahy gi.  Be mature

This guy is trying to hard to be friendly..Hes coming off as creepy and chipku..But Alia is amazing and candid

First time I have ever heard the pet names of Alia&#39;s like aloo, aloo poo, and heroine.

Complete fakeness
I can see his face for some reason :D why is he so irritating?

It&#39;s clear Alia is spending a lot of time with Karan.. She is talking and expressing just like him.. I&#39;m not mad about it tho

Aliya bhatt...full of hiritation

when the next part is coming . waiting

Pure happiness 
I dislike the video beforehand...

Oh god this host is creepy than that bollywood hungama&#39;s. That host is super annoying‍️‍️
Alia my favorite actress she is funny and bubbly

Fuckin Airhead she is !

Host is so cute 

Obviously, How can we hinaholics can forget you Mr  pillai. N why should we see any of your interview if you r not respecting any woman who is representing india n u r commenting on her. U see look aF your self. N why should alia give interview to him

I don&#39;t know why I feel this Alia always copying Selena Gomez in every way

now alia Chang a lot on her face

alia like a little baby here

Alia.. I share...
Bahut pyari si flower  jaisi lag rahi hai. There’s ABSOLUTELY no reason to DISLIKE her just because KATRINA left RANBIR and she grabbed him!!!

She only knows to speak I I I ,give some fake expressions and displaying  teeth.

Why is she overacting???

Love you alia
Alia looking so real and natural

Oh God! please get rid of this guy, he is so cringy, creepy and disgustingly in your space (so close) with cheesy low questions.

Filmfare sells awards- many actors said this in interviews.

I think Alia did skin whitening. She was never that fair skin

Pillai ki
Iski Aankhen itni tharki kyon lag Rahi hai

Alia’s face at <a href="">2:27</a> is a whole mood lol 

I am her fan but i think she dont deserve rk and he don&#39;t deserve her as gf bf because they look brother sister rakhi is coming so she should tie rakhi to rk

It’s totally shows that Bwood is run by groups. They only invite people who associates with Karan johar.

He is DISGUSTINGLY IRRITATINGGG...EEEWWWWWW

Sara Ali Khan next plzzz
How come Mr.Filmfare never asked her about her best friend and her love life !!And how is her relationship with Katrina now ?

Who is this man, he talks like he is everyone's uncle.
She acts like kareena

Aree...i wana see what alia asks!!!

Please some more about alia I love her

Please some more about alia I love her

Please some more about alia I love her

Alia is just fabulous &amp; beautiful &amp; smarttt

Alia- I am not a frooty person, I am a spicy person. Meanwhile Alia has been featured in FROOTY advertisement

Take tutorials from Sara

Host is so annoying and such a aunty

Oho. Women, I can help you if you too hate fruity smells. Think vanilla!

These people trying so hard to make us believe that alia and ranbir are in a relationship lol  we all know your promotional tactics 

I hate his anchoring so irritating 
Cute girl 
Well just a joke- she said I&#39;m not a frooty person but she is the brand ambassador of frooty

The way she said I was 6 .. such a bitch .. arrogant .. hate her

Shraddha kapoor  please

I hope their comes a time when a self made girl reigns bollywood.I am just done with sara,janhvi,ananya,shanaya.....etc etc.Even though I pretty much like them all.

This guy....chatora

baby kareena because you talk like her.

Look at him after trolling hina khan.. Famous ho gaya...

You know I have tried to find this episode everywhere . I have looked for this episode everywhere literally and didn&#39;t found this anywhere and when they posted that Kareena one I even made comment that please post this one and now it is here . Lovvveee this cute side of <a href="">alia.now</a> she has changed a bit

she&#39;s not a fruity person bichara ranbir 

beautiful

is larki ko kuch nahi ata.... she cant even speak properly.

Y everybody is soo jealous of she is called ranbir &quot;girlfriend&quot;....instead of say he is Alia&#39;s &quot;boyfriend&quot;!!...alia is soo talented successful nd yet soo humble nd innocent 

Alia is sooo candid

This guy is cringy mixtures of Karan Johar + Rajeev Masand

Why they r uploading old interviews

She acts talks like Kareena Kapoor..I don&#39;t know whether intentionally or natural

This Jitesh Pillai has crossed the limits of decency. Doesn&#39;t suit him.

Looks like male version of Saroj khan.. Speak also  similar to her..

for some reason I don&#39;t like this girl I prefer shradha

This man is a copy of karan johar

Now Alia&#39;s bubbliness has started rubbing off in an irritating way

Hey aunty
That interviewer&#39;s look is really deep and judgemental just like filmy SAAS, That is how he became a part of Filmfare. Bhai sirf sunne Aya hu shadi hogi or nehi hogi , bohut drama hua so far, ab shadi karle Yaar !!

Alia you are so lovely ️️
Lovely girl...

We love her but she makes overacting

Over acting ki dukhaan
Most lovely and very funny interview of Filmfare so far.

The most cutest  human  being  I have seen in my life  . Love u my aloo. U are the best

It is so refreshing watching an actor like her.  She is so real and her self. She doesn&#39;t try to act cool or modest or in a certain way that attracts a certain audience. She is just herself and that is why I love her.

When she says i i i i................!
I didn&#39;t like the way this was shot. Why was it so Blurry at the other side ? Sometimes Defocusing just disturbs the eyes especially when it is a Long video.

I just love aalia totally completely endlessly 

She&#39;s so genuine. love her and how she&#39;s expressing her love for deepika, no bragging at all

i don&quot;t like her anymore after she started dating ranbir kapoor

I want alia to come out of kjo&#39;s influence. She gets a lot of flak for constantly doing only dharma movies and being served a career in a platter..just distance yourself from kjo

It&#39;s like watching 2 people having a conservation that u don&#39;t know anything about...

Thank you for putting this up

Sara Ali Khan... the next reigning actress

i could see a change in alia and she has gotten more mature than the child like behaviour she had when she was a new bee

I don&#39;t like the fact that she is so called &quot;Girlfriend&quot; of Ranbir But let me watch ‍️

Why she acts like a kareena.....

Low IQ conversations.. Kangana is so right about all these nepo fakers.

Alia is candid always.. soft-spoken and bubbly at d same time... And Pillai always puts on something or the other which makes all his chats spicy

I love alia

Alia is my favourite! 

Can anyone just speak why did it suddenly stopped in <a href="">19:32</a>

Why is she acting like karan johar. !?

No one call u baby kareena, plz kareena  will go n die somewhere she is fare more beautiful n talented u try to act like her because starting of ur carrier no one liked u but urself call u kareena so that people will like u but still atleast dont compare urself n her

Fake

<a href="">14:57</a> u basically did the same thing

Ajeeb

super fun to watch!!

Have waited for this  alia

Very very boring.....

Fake person

This was a delectable Q&amp;A refreshing candid chat 

the most fake nepo boring interviewer coming with the most fake nepo boring actress...this comment for smarts peoples who can read between lines and have psychology bagage not peoples who give cute thug actress easily

I love you alia ️️️
