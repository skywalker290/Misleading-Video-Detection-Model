None of these are gamers if they basically just play the same multiplayer games.

Pewds not being cool is like the world coming too an end

T-Pose

that&#39;s cruel ngl

Dark souls 2 is my favorite 

Tf is wrong with you, whenever you hear a woman saying that she’s a gamer you laugh? Pathetic

Men smh
I can guess who is gay

I feel like they didn’t want to share money with her 

Allot of people seem to be misunderstanding something here2 people are talking extensive game knowledge and one of them is talking out of their ass.3 people who don&#39;t know the game well enough to know who is lyingvoting both out guarantees the win, they did the right thing from a gamers standpoint

Doritos
Bro pull up with a Ness from Mother t-shirt that&#39;s so specific ofc he a gamer

bro was a gamer back when gamers didnt have rights

she did all that work to call him out the guys do jack shit and then they vote her out bruh im disappointed in my people

this is easy just ask about karlson

Just look for the cringe  easy

they guy in striped shirt is fake

Anyone who deserves to be called a gamer could sniff out a non gamer in less than 10 seconds

<a href="">5:33</a> this part always kills me

All of them sound like a complete casuals that you dont want to que up with

We know the last three are gamers cause they got carried

This is low-key actually frustrating that the girl didn&#39;t get any money when she did all the heavy lifting and the 3 guys sat there and did nothing

its the battle dome in pokemon emerald battle frontire

Bryce be asking the audience for some blue paw prints

Bruh this one made me so mad 

If you play lol you are not a gamer

we all know deep down that Nola won.

Geeks are so annoying.

I hate this episode they did nothing and then they voted her out

They forgot to ask Jessica if she had a boyfriend. If she had reached masters playing adc I can assure you it with a duo. She doesn&#39;t look like someone who would go through that much torture playing adc on her own.

They voted her out because she said sonic battle adventures 2 was on game boy…

Those guys were so freaking stupid omfg

sexist asf

Why are Xbox gamers not gamers?

This guy is not a fucking gamer.Player=Doctor

these dudes are incels lmao

The flower girl just destroyed the Veronica guy 

Anyone who ranks Dark Souls 2 the worst got stuck on Darklurker ;)

the girl who solve the mystery, and they voted her out, and she didn&#39;t get the money, how evil is that.

Rewatching these old videos coz no other youthoober makes me laugh

Bro really have to ask his another personality let me finish to speak <a href="">0:52</a>

Omg watching this three years later the T posing makes me want to gauge my eyes out

3,000

Priyanka 99
Honestly it’s kinda her fault for agreeing another round when she already knew she got the mole she would have done the same to somebody else.

The ginger haired guy makes me cringe so hard

League gamers are not gamers

&quot;This guy is a gamer and has a girlfriend... Hmmm&quot;

Hate those 3

Those fucers what an a$$holes

<a href="">6:55</a> all the guys vote the girl out Lmao these are true degenerate gamers

Voted her out because her Chmapion choices where to generic typical league girl

THIS. IS NOT. HOW YOU. T-POSE.... bitchchchch!!!!!!!!!!!!!

why does Pewdiepie laugh when a girl says she&#39;s a gamer...?

start a go fund me for the girl that got absolutely robbed

Remember boys. Woman is distraction. Stay faithful. Die me.
<a href="">16:42</a> May God bless them, they made us laugh
<a href="">15:55</a> You suspected that he was not him  but at the same time you felt that he was not valuable yet
<a href="">15:35</a>  Brother, they drive it
<a href="">15:19</a> The beauty of honesty
<a href="">14:08</a> Thinking outside the box
<a href="">13:25</a> Gamer Moment
<a href="">11:22</a> He cuts her shape and made room for him
<a href="">9:14</a> Agreed
<a href="">7:45</a> Even you 
I knew it was him sence he said something about 90s genre games it jusft felt odd the approach he took to talking about games.

I consider myself a gamer but i dont have interest for dark souls. Sorry felix and everyone else lol

The voting makes no sense. It&#39;s like they put zero thought into what they were voting for. Average gamers

one way to know if you&#39;re a gamer is that you ask them how many platinum trophy&#39;s they have!

Very very annoying that the yellow blue guy seemed like a true gamer than the rest fr

wow, they let the girl kill the monster and steals all the loot. Classic gamer

They knew the last girl was a gamer, they just wanted her out because she was a girl and they get more money

I knew the answer just by looking at the thumbnail lmao

Those last 3 guys are absolutely patheticHid behind her, let her do all the work. Then celebrated with all the money that they didnt earn. Pathetic

these Jubilee videos make me cringe so bad, like this video for example, like i was just falling off my chair very slowly dying from the amount of cringe involved

When the first girl said she was ranked Master at best in League i laughed

bruh wtf? NOLA WAS THE MOST GAMER OUT OF THEM and they just had to vote her out, they don&#39;t deserve shit though if it was me i would have voted them out just because they play league lmfao

Bruh <a href="">1:37</a> i was actually looking down at my old ass cringy shirt that says &#39;Caution: allergic to mornings&#39;, The timing couldn&#39;t have been any better lmao

DS2&gt;DS3

that orange hair man look like @philza

bald pewds

Idk shaming someone for liking a game you think is bad kinda pisses me off, like why? I know pewds is joking here but it’s still really mean to make it someone’s opinion on a game…

Well girls can&#39;t game, they to busy changing their pads am I rite boys?

just check their wrist if there&#39;s a mark of numbness from the mouse dammit

Majority of gamer girls, confident. Majority of gamer boys, unconfident.

She seemed really suspicious when she said &quot;I don&#39;t have a GBA&quot; when they were talking about Sonic adventure 2

I would ask, so... what is the entire title of lol?No wait... &quot;What is the best console and why?&quot;

I would argue that pretending to be a gamer is AS pathetic as pretending not to be so that you could stay in the cool club.:p

.

Wat is the standing there with ur arms out mean?

Ok

Tell me you got fragile masculinity and a small dick without telling me. Maybe they should think about getting a shower instead of getting in their feels

I know i saw the ending but Wait didn&#39;t she say she doesn&#39;t play horror games? how does she have every until dawn character memorized?

They definitely don’t deserve that money, that lady gamer did the hard work and ended up paying the lazy dumbass gamers‍️

those guys just wanted the circle to be shorter for more reward 

She deserved all the money.

1st girl out equality  2nd girl put mysoginy 
I have never played a valve game but I could teach a college course on their world and how half life links up with portal how chell wasn’t going to be the main character for portal two but people wanted glados to recognize them glados stands for genetic life form and disk operating system and the origins of the start of aperture science shower curtains to present I would win this thing so badly I would be final 2

T posing like that is the cringiest shit ever

me wearing no shirt
Games be games

“This guy is a gamer and has a girlfriend”  that’s impossible

Same like how to figure out if someone’s a fake “ex-muslim” tell them to recite Al-Fatihah. If they say they don’t know how to recite it they’re fake.

I play Sudoku. I’m a gamer too?

If the girl was confident that dude was the mole, why did she offer to play another round? xD

<a href="">11:12</a> this feels like emily speaking

<a href="">1:50</a>      you rewacthed that and decided to put that in the video

Just ask you you know csgo? If they say yes ask each of them questions like &quot;where is jungle mirage&quot; &quot;where is banana on inferno&quot;

<a href="">1:47</a> why?

Bruh woman carries all the boys and doesn&#39;t get money.

<a href="">0:06</a> &quot; <b>Five</b> gamers&quot;...

Final Fantasy &gt; Kingdom Hearts &gt; Rest

Those dumbasses committed to the meme that Girls cant be gamers

It&#39;s funny though cause one of my friends likes dark souls 2 the most

The first dude that said he played haunting was to obscure I still believe he is a gamer

Guy doesn’t even know the characters name in his FAVOURITE GAME XDDD

This is the best jubilee vid ive seen

Battle dome was the pokémon R/S/E endgame XD

Jesus loves you so so much and he wants the best for us but we just have to accept his help‍

Gamer do the game. Gamer is gamer. I is gamer. U is too.

It’s not sexism when woman don’t usually game

the gamer is among us

Ds2 &gt; Ds3

I was certain striped shit white guy was the mole when he had the evil smirk when the first girl got voted off instead of him.

Ask what&#39;s the name of the main character of Zelda games.

Damnnn time flies
The Waffle House has found a new host

honestly there assholes for not giving her the money she literally just won the game for them and they kicked her outalso that t-pose was annoying

Battle dome said 6+ 
Jeez people arguing she deserves the money. They exactly knew she wasn&#39;t the mole still voted her out to keep the cash that&#39;s Clever

You guys don&#39;t seem to understand They weren&#39;t dumb for voting her out, they get more money

im actually disgusted, they 3 are not gamer

Gamers playing among us

Master? Bold face LIE!!!!!!!

I&#39;m so salty for her

Me: I love playing video gamesFelix: NOT A GAMER!
&quot;this guy is a gamer and has a girlfriend....&quot; suspicious indeed 

KH2 is goated

This is annoying and funny at the same time because she literally carried them and they did nothing.I guess they voted her out for them to have more part of the money.

Man searched up the wrong battle dome 

so surprised the girl who said she liked farming games didn’t say anything about stardew valley 

why shouldn&#39;t women use it?  <a href="">12:28</a>

It’s funny I’d agree with kicking out people that pick dark souls 2 but I have a friend that loves it more than one but he likes 3 the best

The most outrageous episode of all

Bahaha when he said Veronica, I to thought immediately of the Asian girl in Until Dawn.

Girl: does pro gamer moveDudes: the femoid is making us look bad, gtfo thot

That was a pro gamer move by the boys,they knew she is a real gamer but still they voted her out so that they won&#39;t have to divide money with her 

LMFAO, they don&#39;t deserve that money. Effin monkeys.

Battle dome 
POV you said to your mom you cleaned your room for no reason <a href="">9:41</a>

We all know that blond girl died on everyone first playthrough

Jessica really got shorted out at the beginning. The fact that she even knew it was season 9 in league is more than enough to trust. How would anyone fake know that

i m pissed of because of what they did at the end &gt;:#

no way they voted her out lmaoo

From the second I saw him, I knew he was the mole. And I was 100% sure.

Loser boy incel gamers just showing the world why they should never reproduce.

Literally the exact shirt that I’m wearing

battle frontier not battle dome

The monster in until dawn is the wendigo. I win $1 million dolllars. Also mole man mixed up the characters of until dawn with friday the 13th, all the names he used are in that game. 

Why is the mole celebrating after he was caught in the most destructive way a mole was caught on this series lol

Me not wearing a shirt

Yea you do be judging people easy 

You sounded like Erin the Vegan in your opening lol

What a bunch of dicks the last three guys

They could&#39;ve get rid of the mole in 5 seconds bro. But no..

Pewds: you know you’re a gamer when u have a unfunny t-shirt.Me looking down: shirtless

your faking too be a gamer i have not seen you finsh a game you do one or 2 videos i am a real gamer i finsh all my games i have proof in parts i do lets plays and fullgame walkthroughs channels like my self are real gamers you are not sir you just using gaming as a prop too grow your fame . you now doing reaction videos 15 min topic talk videos .i do topic talk videos not as much anymore . i focesing on finshing my games .

This video made me so mad lol

Guy on the right really dressed up in the Ness shirt bruh.

Battle dome is thing in pokemon emerald NOT a board game

wait I thought there was suppost to be 1 fake gamer

<a href="">0:22</a> How to get comments on your video

These people in the comments are stupid they are too awkward to join an argument the girls are just more open

My favourite game is star wars battlefront 2: 2005 version

More like 1 real gamer vs 1 fake gamer and then 3 Douches who did nothing...

this video had me crying laughing

Those guys did not deserve the money in any way at all and were just incredibly cringy the whole way through holy shit

&quot;T pose&quot;I TRUST YOU!Man, too bad trust isn&#39;t that easy to gain, huh?I&#39;m 34 (turned this month) been gaming since 4yo. My dad was really into it as well and would be playing games whenever I came home from school.

My all time favorite game is fall out 4 After that Jak and daxter

those 3 at the right made like the high council during that whole arguing

Wait if you play Xbox you&#39;re not a gamer

MMmmmmmm... dooooritos

I was literally playing dark souls 2 when he said to throw them out if they say ds2 best 

I&#39;m happy that they robbed the girl who discovered the mole lol. I didn&#39;t like her a bit

You know therr gamers they&#39;re teaming on the best player

Eat a 5 star.... Do nothing

I am trying to get as many replies on this comment. Pls reply to this comment.

I thought they had it on the first vote tbh. She could barely describe league of legends and then claimed to be master tier in league bro obvious lie is obvious

I love how he said not a gamer if you played Xbox PLAYSTATION FOR LIFE!!!!!! Pcs are also the king of gaming

those three probably kill steals in league 

God these guys are so fucking cringy like ima “gamer” which sounds bad by itself but god this is alot

Bro plays league of legends 
Dark souls 2 was good but just not the same my guess is you never completed it

Bro I guarantee you that they just voted her out because they wanted it to just be them lol also I bet they played video games with each other after this

Literally all they had to ask is “which cod zombies is the best” and when they said bo3 they were safe

they are so annoying

Spread the gospel

Spread the gospel

“I like spending hours seeing a single number increase by 1”Now that’s a gamer

What if I combine all four of them and watch my brother speedrun a game on his phone with an Xbox controller?

Girl mvp. Fu other trashgamers

111M

The ending make me lost hope in humanity

they are all so cringy lol

&quot;that is so sexism&quot; 

Nola carried while they T-posed, and they voted her off after she finished doing all the work..   I guess they really were league players.

That girl gave like a 1000x better case than the dude on the first exile or whateverI&#39;m also not like an overly sensitive twitter user or anything like that but i am fully convinced they did vote the second girl out just for being a girl, like i have no idea why else they would have voted her out after she singlehandedly sniffed the mole out.

this was actually sofrustrating wtf

Favorite game would easily be Nintendo Land for any true gamers out there. True hood classic.

How do they get the most Normie ass gamers on the planet for their videos. I swear the game should have been try find the actual gamer cuz these guys ain’t it dawg.

MOBILE =CALL OF DUTY MOBILE AND WARZONE MOBILE NOT PATHETIC

At first moment I felt bad for her, but considering she could have said &quot;I think the mole is out&quot; instead of &quot;We should do one more round&quot;. I feel like she should have showed some disagreement with continuing at least. I guess she had little info about others and didn&#39;t notice they T posed an alliance behind her back

I&#39;ve been playing  game for 27 years and i enjoyed Dark Souls 2 the best. x) I would totally throw people on the wrong path :)And these guy voting Nola out? They just wanted more money. She was FIRE!

I dont play souls but i play GeOmEtRy DaSh 100+ hours

SPOILERSPACE;It was between the mole and the kingdom hearts guy for me. But the guy was simply too edgy to be a real person, i smelled it a mile away.

Y&#39;all are so offended but it&#39;s legit a game. They&#39;re outplaying her that&#39;s all it is. Sexism has nothing to do with it.

<a href="">15:52</a> “it’s definitely the guy that looks like a school shoo-“

He was about to call the tall guy a school shooter but stopped lmfao

lats play this game in comment section of pewdiepie

Also fave game : Mario bros original 1985
Pro gamer move, let everyone turn on each other and then get the cash.

go to coal mine Felix or in any case Stockholm
When the hell did they say women can&#39;t game?

OVERWATCH??? pog

I like that she did all the work and they decided to kick her out for more money, truly gamers

The mf in glasses doesn&#39;t even try to hide the fact that he&#39;s sexist. What a joke.

wow and LOL aren&#39;t real games get them out of there

I’d call myself a casual gamer

Speaking if dark souls games, I&#39;ve been considering getting a game like that or Skyrim. Anyone got some suggestions?

Pewds says he doesn’t like “Until Dawn” clearly has no respect for the horror category anymore. He should really get back into it with “The Dark Pictures Anthology” they are made by the same people and have given me jump scares that I was expecting but still shit myself and I should be ashamed. YOU’RE NOT A REAL GAMER UNLESS A HORROR GAME HAS MADE YOU SHIT YOUR PANTS!!! Change my mind.

Ashley? Um that’s Emily!

Well that was interesting.

When u type ggez after getting carried by someone

None of them have played COD 

My gaming childhood: World of Warcraft, and im still playing.

I swear to God I’ve played until Dawn like at least 10 times and that’s very concerning. would I say it’s my favourite game? definitely not. Would I say that I like it? totally.

Pewds: Disses mobile gamers calling them not real gamersAlso Pewds: advertises mobile game at end of video

<a href="">0:10</a> omggggg this is the OG ksi edit

bro then said the word

I hate gamer community when it comes to women , unless she is pro everyone will start call her a fake gamer just bc she women:/

The guy who mentioned nothing but league didn&#39;t deserve to win lmaoo

The t-posing got me

bruh guy in hoddie has Hematolagnia (blood fetshis)

Are u a gamer pewdiepie huh prove that u are a gamer

Bro listening to the games they play I believe there is a difference between gamers and these kind of gamers lmao

Bro I just looked up Ashley from until dawn and it’s a white girl with blonde hair and no mole

GAYMER!?!?

6 girls v&#39;s 1 boy

I just found out that I am not a gamer, guess I&#39;ll just end my game dev carreer.

Dude they knew she wasn’t the mole but they still kicked her out before getting the money. She was ROBBED!!!

PewDiePie has a girlfriend and is gamer.

I would’ve murdered them after the game if I were her bruh, they didn’t deserve that money

as someone whose favorite game is kingdom hearts, you’re right i can’t stfu ab it

none of them has played minecraft

I was thinking dark souls the whole time! Lol

Yo dark souls 2 is my fav dark souls,am i fake?????
the fact that they voted her out  the guys are all cringe musty gamers

i had to hide it

tbf she kinda brought it on herself for being greedy. if she was so confident the dude was the mole she should&#39;ve voted to end that round but instead she wanted to keep going, probably bc she was confident in staying in and winning more

That T pose is the most annoying thing I have ever seen in my life

My guess is the green and black shirt guy, early guess.

T

T

T

Gay-mer

I remember when you insulted people who played World of Warcraft. Don&#39;t play victim dude, you were the one who bullied for games LOL

I knew it from the start, just saying...

The fact that both the girls got voted out

this guy is a gamer and he has a girlfriend hmm. marzia: do i not exsist

wall hacks

It&#39;s not my fault I am banned from gaming thanks to my sis playing all the time.

gamer moment
“I can’t even count.”Thinks of how you need to calculate the odds of basically everything in almost any game. NOT GAMER! Now if he said he couldn’t read at some point, I’d completely believe in him being a gamer boy. Sad to see Nola get voted out after susing the mole out, quizzing the other guys and just being more knowledgeable then all three of them combined.

Such BS. Girl on the far left was the best player. Deserves ALL the money.

the battle dome in pokemon emerald XD

Hand it to the league players to kick the carry.

Pewdiepie: Is a gamer and has a girlfriend, hmmm.......Me: Thinks about pewds and marzia.Also me: Casts very suspicious glare at pewds and thinks, &#39;&#39; Did he forget about himself and Marzia or is he declaring that he too is not a gamer, hmmmm........

I&#39;m in round 1 and I&#39;m confident trhe mole went out. That girl is not master. xD

You can&#39;t fool gamers
felix: he&#39;s a gamer and has a girlfriend...hmmmm*sus look*/me: look who&#39;s speaking

Th y can&#39;t accept a gamer girl and want a gamer gfHmm Hippocrates

you play games your not a gamer

why can girls not do it with their hands so I liked you but now I&#39;m a little disappointedAnd that makes me sad

well now, thats just sexist.

league doesn&#39;t count as a videogame

Why didn&#39;t they make them say the gamer word it would weed out the mole quickly

A gamer with a girlfriend suspicious. Pewdiepie with  wife

the stripped shirt mf  was so fking obvious lmao  he is  the guy who plays  granny and slender and shit

they all playing shit games bro, why pokemon 

Bryce literally just talked of slenderman

You bad Xbox good

Felix: This guy is a gamer and has a girlfriend hhhmmmmmFELIX YOU ARE MARRIED!*just here to rewatch this (more of Jubilee reacts pls)

Ah, another example of lazy men piggybacking off of women’s hard work and benefitting from it while the woman gets absolutely nothing.

Pewdiepie:He&#39;s a gamer and has a girlfriend hmm suspicious Also Pewdiepie:Has a wife and is a gamer

get the girls out instant. simple.

Soullllsss gamesss
<a href="">15:50</a> its definitely the guy who looks like a shoo- a sho... the guy on the left.

yo these gamers dont want money

Those steam names sound like those Xbox names that are made up

They both don’t even know Emily’s name

You’re a hypocrite
call of duty

why did they vote her out omg

<a href="">7:37</a> Transitioning from Dota 2 to League maybe? lol

Would guess the guy who is talking the most isn&#39;t the gamer lol

The until dawn part made me hurt lmaoo

im pretty sure the guys just thought &quot;lets vote her out so we have more money each&quot;

pewdiepie: prove ur a gamerme: i watching old pewdiepie videos
his cut looks like eminems

Pewds gamer test with dark souls I do the same with the devil may cry series, if anyone says number 2 is their favourite they are fake gamer 

they should ask do you sleep

my question would’ve been “how do you craft a saddle in minecraft”

The true essence of gaming is challenging little kids to 1v1s, spawn trapping them and   after you win you lord over them as if you are a superior being.

Wth that girl should of got the moneyShe was the one who found the mole and the one who talked the most about her gaming experiences. The 3 dudes that won hardly said anything.

Pro gamer moves in this vid

How to spot a fake gamer its easy. Ask he/she a handshake Because YOU DONT HANDSHAKE

<a href="">2:28</a> its totally not as if when that thing well was a thing  it was a meme and the whole entire internet knew about it nah its a gamer thing

“whenever i hear a woman say their a gamer it makes me laugh” …..

Dark souls 2 is definitely the best just based on the magic

When your team is a girl, you know she would be noisy on the voice chat. So they kicked her out even she&#39;s good. LOL.

I dont think that you&#39;re a gamer for playing lol

These people give me the vibe of their parents not letting them play more than 30 mins a day

Praise God And God Bless You All!

Just ask what graphics card they have

Those three piss me off to no end. They literally voted Nola out seemingly out of spite because her energy made them uncomfortable. Classic beta male gamer move. Disappointed but not surprised

You know they&#39;re gamers when they kill off the person with the most kills lmao

“The point is, I walked so you guys can run” I love him

I just feel like the 3 guys who got the money are sexist asf, for voting off the first girl when the actual mole said red and green trucks or whatever he said, and for voting of the second girl when  she was clearly not the mole,bcz she answered all the questions without any hesitation and for the last game she got ik she did have to think about it but that should of come off as a good thing cuz it would mean she has a lot of games and she said she gets her games in bundles so idk y they did that-_-

Should be ezGotta be blues clues

PUBG is the best.

Those guys are truly pathetic. They didn’t deserve that money. And the NERVE of them to celebrate at the end when the girl did all the work. As a girl I used to love playing games back in middle school; I’m reminded now why I quit for good.

!votekick
in asia (southeast asia) when u say to ur parents hey mom i am a gamer ur mom: omae wa mou shindeiru

I hope that I don’t have to be a good gamer to start uploading videos to YouTube, I suck at games but I want to learn how to be better and be like pewdiepie and a nerd  and a geek! I’m just a lesbianI love animal crossing..Call of duty Mortal kombat Mario gamesDetroit become human I haven’t been able to play over watch but I love reaperAmong us

Black hair lady is 
I am pathetic 

They chose a girl who actually knows about games over a man who knows red a blue truck in slender man

Bruh you are a gamer and you have a wife 

Sonic adventure 2 on gba? I thought it was sonic advance 2 (2002) Even though this might not be seen by many…

When a gamer has wife, understandable.When a gamer has girlfriend, THATS SUS.

Gaming

..

hahaha jobilee. just switch. the b and l its a filipino restaurant

why everyone playin fat discord mod games over here(aka league of legends)

Lmao this is dumb they could have voted out some other guy but they voted out the girl instead even tho she had better knowledge about games.

&#39;Windows shutdown face&#39; 
<a href="">3:00</a>

s9 master is so cap

When epic gamer plays games
BRO WHEN THEY VOTED HER OUT 
they kicked her out because they had to protect their virginity guys, duh!

I’m embarrassed to be a gamer when I watch this

Thats should be easy?

the blond girl is definitely not Master lol

When they all T posed lmao

Oooooooooo-Oooo,-,O,-,-,

casual sexism by pewds

Honestly, the definition of a gamer is really nebulous, and as a kid I was a hardcore gamer, while as an adult I’m a casual gamer. I could easily bullshit as a hardcore retro gamer.

They just did a general shepherd on the black haired girl

when she said shes a master rank at league ik that was bs asf

<a href="">0:01</a> Super epic gamer is PewDiePie

Nola: <b>Does all the work and discovers the mole</b>The other 3 guys: <b>T posing like idiots</b>

Pewds literally was about to say the school shooter lookin- I mean the guy on the left

I think its scripted to ask dumb questions. I mean how can you start a conversation about and not find the person that don&#39;t know shit. Lets see first ask everyone if they played games like dark souls or hollow knight or any difficult game and then if everyone agrees on any one then talk about their experiences. The person who lied wouldn&#39;t be able to come up with shit.And if you suspect someone then ask then incorrect questions like do you think mimic boss in dark soul 1 was badly designed boss fight.Edit - hadn&#39;t reached the end before commenting. Want to add, these 3 guys are either dumb af or just reddit trolls.

I hope nola reads these comments so she know we all are at her side, she deserves all that money

Talking abt sexist smh

I have completed Antil dawn like if u have too

The asian girl is Emily, Nola. Not Ashley.

guys are dumb really...

Apple sauce
I think he meant battle frontier.

anol backwards is what u are if u don&#39;t like this comment

My favourite is AC

i knew it was the green stripe guy when he touched the womans hand after beating her in rock paper scissors, no gamer would touch a random good looking woman

I&#39;m not even a gamer and the mole was pretty obvious right from the get go. Who plays 90s games?! 

Pewds: &quot;Every time a girl says that she&#39;s a gamer I laugh&quot;Sniperwolf: &quot;And I took that personally&quot;

Worst fake gamer i have ever see hahaha
first time i&#39;ve been legitimately happy abt who won

<a href="">15:50</a> “it’s defiantly the guy that looks like a shoo..ugh school sho ugh.. the guy on the left” LMAOOO

I feel bad for the lady, she deserved the money. She caught the mole and it was so obvious she was a gamer, I think they were just being selfish so they voted her out to get more money.

How can you call yourself a gamer by being a gamer starting college? lol Being a gamer/nerd is starting from primary/middle school not in college.

Gayyymers
my favorite game is by far COD (i love all of them but my favorite COD campain is COD ww2)

I&#39;m a little late but I gotta say this. So many idiots in the comment section here. &quot;Why vote off the girl who carried them???&quot;None of the 3 guys had played the game Bryce and her were discussing. They had no idea who was right and who was faking it. So you vote off both and call it a day. It&#39;s such a basic and straight forward approach that it&#39;s unbelievable how many people in the comments here don&#39;t understand it.

Bdv i think pokemon battle dome is the late game of pokemon emerald

Bro The Mole just walked up like a savage LOL!

I&#39;m an Xbox gamer lol don&#39;t make fun of us.

What’s with them and the t-pose they are so cringe!!!

Naol got that ikea shirt tho

Pewds, why do you find it funny when woman call themselves gamers?

Democracy.
Pewds telling himself to let him finish his sentence

I have the exact same shirt as that guy with the stupid shirt

all boyz r gamers

<a href="">59:45</a> this is not in the video

<a href="">0:01</a>

<a href="">2:36</a> apple sauce
I have that shirttttttt noooooooo it is funny i swearrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Until Dawn is an interactive story! Not a game. If you are into survival horror, you would say Silent Hill 2, 3 or Resident Evil etc or other ps2 classics like project zero/fatal frame or maybe a rare horror game like Kuon. Not until Dawn! He is the mole! I have never heard a fan of survival horror name Until Dawn as their favorite! How about Dead Space? Even that&#39;s a better choice. 

i would have fucking raged at those idiots if i was that girl

SHE BETTER STEAL THAT MONEY

Easy!

IT TOOK 5 second for that i would do it in 0

???????????????????????????????waaaaaaaa?????

They kicked the <b>girl</b> out … <b>feminists making a patriarchy associated comment in the comment section</b>

bruh this is the most sexist jubilee video i’ve seen

I just like the black guy cuz his favorite game is kh

Me: being a gamer and wearing a blue shirt saying think pink..

Just going back and watching this I remember how bad his haircut was

Ok

I play games on pc, and frequent usage of mouse creates a mark on the wrist!!  they should&#39;ve haved checked that....

Those guys probably report every top player that beat them in a game. Freaking clutch or kick, but kick even after clutch type of deal.

It is true
the girl really did 100% of the heavy lifting and then got voted out so she didn’t get the money… that makes me so mad fr

People in the comments don&#39;t know the difference between &quot;Real gamers&quot; and &quot;Toxic gamers&quot;...

t

I gamer

A linux gamer would&#39;ve been so funny 

I despise people who just keep talking about LOL all the time. Other games be like: .....

<a href="">5:50</a> your wrong dark souls 2 is my favorite dark souls

Pewds: this guy is a gamer and have a girlfriend suspicious Me: You have a wife!

man she knows her until dawnbut i 100% agree with you i love until dawn its a great game but it wouldnt be my favorite game

What happened to the good old days of buff men playing halo then screaming when they lose. Smh at least gamers are still based

<b>PTSD to toxic, misogynistic discord servers and VCs</b>

why does felix look like max gawn?
You are not cool
WTF is this weird glitch at <a href="">1:35</a>

noice hair cut boi
<a href="">0:30</a> i guess dream isn&#39;t a gamer

I don&#39;t use steam anymore but my Id is SexyBeast. It&#39;s great when friending people I know

God of War army here!

im mad
If you try to guess first, skip to the end, and then watch it knowing who is the fake gamer makes it so obvious

red truck and blue truck won

Until Dawn characters: Sam, Josh, Chris, Ashley, Emily, Jessica, Matt, and Mike. Featuring Hannah and Beth during the prologueThere is no Veronica. And if there was, she would suck

Yes I play geometry dash and mincraft and also battel cats

Pewds is literally married and is suspiscious of someone for having a girlfriend. Hmmm, PewDiePie not real gamer confirmed?

They truly are virgins

Those guys were totally useless the whole time lmfao!

I play Minecraft

these guys are clearly sexists i mean ok they voted a girl on round first which mean sense but the girl who showed her game knowledge and find out they just kicked her out without even asking any questions they are like girls cant play games

&quot;I like 90s horror games&quot; like nigga what? What 90s horror games, the dude gave himself away instantly

It’s all in the eyebrows

The girl deserve the win noo 

Make a video to do with crew 2

I have a love hate relationship with these videos because sometimes the competitors already know they found the mole but because they get more money with less people alive they sometimes just vote randomly

I like to think I’m a gamer cuz I play a lot of games but I can’t afford a console or pc so I play on my iPad but I play games like every day I play Minecraft, ark, terraria, cod mobile, pubg mobile, and other shooter games

It looks more like 5 non gamers vs one real gamer

The solomon guy is still the best (ngc reference)

Just ask them for their set up

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAUWHSUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA

There should be a rule: the more people are left, the more money each person gets

Felix - <a href="">7:00</a>Also Felix - <a href="">1:48</a>
Me who has never played any of the souls games.

i looked  at if i had a shirt on but im naked -_-

Sexists

ness

&#39;&#39;How do you know you can trust me?&#39;&#39;CROUCH - UNCROUCH - CROUCH- UNCROUCH

pewdiepie is the gamer version of Erin

report the real video of them (not this reaction) , the vidoe doesn&#39;t deserve to still exist after kicking out nola :) so report it please

Xbox is gamer

F*ck the winner, hate it

The three boys who won were  sexists ngl

I love playing on my xbox 360

A real gamer would sayI have crippling depression

Imagine finding the mole and being kicked out beacuse your a female and seeing the other donters bath in money

You know those 3 winners were real gamers since they voted out the MVP before they get the dub.

Nola deserves justice! She was the one who spotted the fake and the guys just booted her out. Like what!

3 guys = giga chads
The first girl is not a gamer too cmon

If I was her I&#39;d be fuckin pissssed.

if pewdiepie can somehow in the universe be cool I can

he cringe in this video is too much to handle

The gaslighting is strong with stripey-sweater guy

Yayyyy Paper Mario....SO good!!
She not masters bruh. She got brain like silver

Tjena

Xbox?

The guy with blue and yellow shirt is my favourite I FRICKING LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS. and yes we cant stop talking about itIf I was there my defense would be explaining most of the kh lore lmfao

Bros before hoes
My teacher says games are a waste of time, Everyone says gaming is a waste of time, And they also say youtubers are uneducated losers. 

You know they voted her out cause she is girl right?

That’s some elitist misogynistic bullshit right there smh. I’m a 50 year old woman, I’m a gamer, cue humour apparently. Whatever dude, I was around at the birth of gaming, my passion is open world RPG’s, over 1000 hours in BOTW, a masterpiece of a game. If people laugh that’s fine, glad I brightened up ya day 

<a href="">0:52</a> &quot;Let me finish sentence&quot;I&#39;m a bit worried Felix 

Shit, I lost it when you said anyone who has kingdom hearts as their favorite game can’t shut the f*** up about it. Lol 

This seem like the worst group project on Earth

gross, those guys are gross

Why y’all so offended in the comments lmao , it was hilarious but it was also kinda messed up lol , lighten up a little bit you guys are more upset than the girl was

Geez, htf the first girl out is even a gamer? She just answered &quot; a lot of farming and the turrets too&quot;, and she is MASTER? Christ..

Pewds: <b>is a gamer and has A WIFE</b>Also Pewds: SUS!

Dude this girl was a fucking BEAST! She single handidly solved that shit.

When guys are worse than girls, they just try their best to ruin their gameplay by teamkilling. I&#39;ve seen this multiple times while gaming and I can confirm, these guys are just the average toxic people who complain about their teammates all the time

paper mario nice, nintendo not
The fact they voted her out made them true gamers

Bruh
Guy on the right giving me Tye vibes from the middle schooler video 

Pro Gamer move

I’m a gamer and I low key would hate to hangout with the three last guys standing  the girls seem chill and fun to talk to but the guys did nothing but t pose

Those guys who won deserve none of the money they were so quiet and The  girl basically did everything

Pewds then: i never actually watch these Pewds now: makes react content of themNo hate i actually like the content

I hate saying “I’m a gamer.”I prefer to call myself a connoisseur of playable media.

They are a bunch of losers for voting her out

the guy that was the fake looks like he&#39;s gay tbh

If I were there I would start the game with one of the most iconic words from the gaming world &quot;Aw, sh*t! Here we go again!&quot; The ones whom struggled to get the reference would definitely be a sus.

The girl carried the whole team, but got kicked out. That&#39;s the most unfair shit I&#39;ve ever seen in the gaming history.

Why r All league players so f cringe

easy questions what console do you play. and why?

Why?

i got it right

Those 3 guys who won were sexist as fuckthey deserved to get voted out, They voted the person who  literally helped find the mole whilst  they just did The t-pose

Those 3 last guyz were the toxic ones

 why do her like that

I am a gamer and I’m about to get a girlfriend and she is a gamer

Gamers love unfunny shirts..... <b>looks down</b> wearing an &quot;I&#39;m Pickle Rick!&quot; Its funny okay

I got a Minecraft shirt on

The one with the buff deedeedee is a gamer

Basically they called them all nerds by voting out the pretty girl and leaving the average one that doesn’t pose a threat

Why not just ask: „Whats the uneversal sign of peace?“Answer: sneak a bunch of times

bye
I knew it was the guy on the far left the moment he said &quot;I like 90&#39;s horror games&quot;. Like, first off gamers don&#39;t talk like that? Lol second, 90s horror games that&#39;s like... maybe 10 games. Dude clearly did not research enough about games to win lol

Pewds: I can tell hes a gamer because he wears an unfunny shirt also pewds wearing a white shirt

Another one that gave him away, he said &quot;Sonic Adventures 2&quot;, as in plural. I knew he wasn&#39;t a gamer by then

the boys had to come together

lol you can tell shes a gamer cause her antisocial

Bro they just THIRD PARTY IRL

gr

“this guy is definitely a gamer, he has a unfunnny shirt” 

<a href="">15:53</a> Felix caught himself there

that guy on the left is like the people that play mobile games and say &quot;I&#39;m a gamer too&quot;... like no ur not ur weird, thats all u are

<a href="">1:25</a> I WAS WEARING A SHIRT THAT SAID&quot;CONTROL FREAK&quot; WITH A PANDA WITH A CONTROLLER AND A HEADSET

I believe they would be brainless enough to kick Pokimane or SniperWolf

If she&#39;s master in League, imma throw my Pc out of the window

The fact they voted the girl out who carried them is the most gamer thing I&#39;ve ever seen.

Lmao she sounds like a complete noob and said she&#39;s Master in league? I&#39;d kick her out instantly

I was just waiting for someone to say &quot; i play minecraft&quot;

This is like Amogus

I like horror games but they never could be my favorite game.

&#39;... I was a minority&#39; hahahaha

They just voted the girl out to get more money thats unfair!

i new it

I looked at my shirt.....

I wear star war shirt and i never watched a star war movie

Felix: ‘’this guy is a gamer and has a girlfriend’’also Felix: married

serious question here, are fifa players real gamers? very heated topic but many friend groups out there need this question answered

This the first time I don&#39;t hate every single person on the set.also, T.

The winners did Absolutely nothing to help

Ahh yes, gamer being retarded as ever. Literally voted out the carry of the team

<a href="">7:19</a> as a kingdom hearts fan i can confirm this lmao we just won&#39;t shut the fuck up about it

So none of them know call of duty and fortnite

Is this among us she spotted the mole and they still voted for her

Getting carried by a girl and then killing her,  you know those guys are true gamers

You know they&#39;re gamers when they kick out the best performing player.

“He’s a gamer? With a girlfriend? Hmmmmm”



Says the married man himself

Girl: (Literally carries the team)





Guys: Hmm, it&#39;s too good to be true, let&#39;s eliminate her

Still waiting for a odd man episode where they are all the moles but they don’t know

Someone who is Chinese
That women was exposing him which was funny  Monry was meant to be for the women

Feels like they literally threw her out so they wouldn&#39;t have to share the money with her ..

<b>Real gamers respect all gamers</b>

Is the girl single? Asking for a friend...

Dude react to philiphine funny video

That girl should&#39;ve won all the money. She&#39;s way more into gaming than the other 3 guys. Man this pisses me off ! She proved to everyone that she knew what she was talking about and then gets voted out.

Is playing minecraft Counted as Gamer

Who in the hell plays these games bro

Nah the ending is just maddening the three geeks didn’t even contribute to anything really

Ultimate Gamer Move

wears amongus shirt and gets voted off because he was sus

No offense, but that one guy kinda looks like Steve from blues clues.

PewDiePie is a PlayStation and PC gamer

If I switched with the girl I would have punched them afterwards, what bastards

&quot;Anyone who says Kingdom Hearts is their favourite game cannot shut the fuck up about it&quot;That&#39;s so true it hurts. 

the girl: <b>*uses smarts to find out the mole*</b> surely i deserve one fourth of that money.the three other guys: THE BOYS HAVE DECIDED.

&quot;Anyone who has Kingdom Hearts as their favourite game cannot shut the fuck up about it.&quot;I feel attacked.

I was drinking water at that time and I choke on it  <a href="">6:28</a>

Eminem
Those last three dudes didn&#39;t deserve anything. Nola supremacy!

I like how these guys r all like 20+ and slenderman ummmm what da dog doing

Gamer... time spent and money spend.

Is it me or most of ppl who play Sims are weird ?

THEY DON&#39;T DESERVE THE MONEY

Idk kinda cringe they kicked this girl.

The girl did all the work and the guys kicked her out after and took home the money lmao nice

honestly those guys are ugly annoying and sexist there was literally no point of thatp

The guys: Just killed a woman feeling good

pewds laughs at girl gAMERS AFTER THAT SAYS SEXISTS

Mole:have you ever played sonic adventureS 2Women:I never owned a gbaMe: but.....that&#39;s for the game cube.....<b>ETERNAL SCREAMING</b>

<a href="">13:19</a> when they started T posing LOL and they WOn

They should do an honest person among compulsive liars 0-0

<a href="">0:30</a> also smallant: &quot;Am i a joke to you?&quot;

what is Jessica&#39;s twitch name?

Well I like thos guys

As much as I disagree with the guys voting out the person who did literally everything for them and single-handedly won the money... They sure ain&#39;t no simps

this whole episode is refference to &quot;back to the kitchen&quot; meme

This just proves how misogynistic the gamer community is

All the girls saying the boys are bad for voting out the girl you wouldn&#39;t know either because you wouldn&#39;t be watching

yes   yes yesyesyesyesyes

Lahhhhhffffs

Doritos mode:Activated
i like kingdom hearts dude and the variety girl, respectful gamers

I survived 15 days in muck thats enough?

Coming back a year later it angers me to see Pewds not know anything about the Battle Dome from Pokémon Emerald

Pewds ds2 my afavourite souls game.... punch me come on bro

Anyone that isn’t pewdiepie isn’t a gamer

Why do you laugh when you hear a girl say they’re a gamer?  Actually can’t believe you said that.

<a href="">9:00</a> you wouldn&#39;t believe to amount of normies college kids who adore that game

Im a gamer because I pass all levels of mario kart

<a href="">1:39</a> ppl who are not wearing clothes: mmm skin intresting

Dark Souls 2 is a really good game, change my mind

Fucking gamer moves
<a href="">15:39</a> I mean how dumb could you possibly be?

<a href="">0:39</a> Same

WTF?! dude , dont lough about women been gamers

that was the among us prequel

Hey battle dome is that place in emerald right

what type of gamer am i if my favorite is cyberpunk

why does the guy with the green and black shirt look like the guy from blues clue

there was no valid reason for them to vote the poor girl out other than thinking girls can&#39;t game because what the frack. she literally did everything for them too, like c&#39;mon guys... cmonnnn LMAO

Pewdiepie is right about kingdom hearts fans not shutting up. My ex was one and I started playing because he would NOT SHUT UP about it. The story line is so confusing

To be honest I didn&#39;t even hear ur voice when I was watching the video 

Me and a boys win a moneyNO EXTRA GIRLS

I actually knew from the start that he was the Fake Gamer, his voice and movements just clearly gave it away to me.

Just have everybody say the gamer word...

That&#39;s how you know the boys are gamers cuz they were just standing there confused

W8 I&#39;m a gamer but what is haunting I&#39;ve never heard that game or do they mean horror

thats sad for the girl 

BRUH I WAS THAT GUY SAYING THAT THE SHIRT THING WAS TRUE!!!  NOOOOOO!!!

Controversial : I don&#39;t like league of legends

Blah blah blah
what was this pose they made?

Kingdom Hearts is the best

The fact that this reaction vid has more views than the original video

that&#39;s some bull that she doesn&#39;t get anything when she did the work of finding the mole. they just stood there and did nothing. she should&#39;ve won everything.

The first game I played was the halo 3 Xbox 360 the death ring

Was SLOMON in the corner?

They want to avoid being called simp. How pathetic

Ask them if they know the konami code

I&#39;m not sure, but did any of the three T-pose guys actually play until dawn? Because I didn&#39;t and one of the two was most likely making stuff up about it. So I would maybe go safe and eliminate them both.

Uhhhh..... Craft of Duty 360?

Among us in real life

You&#39;re right about the kingdom hearts bit  I can never shut up about how much I love it and my tattoo and all the kingdom hearts merch I have and how much I love axel

I feel so bad for the girl xD

theyre not gamers none of them said minecraft

why laugh when a girl says she’s a gamer?? misogynistic much

Atleast they did a pro gamer move

she shoulda got every dollar smh pricks

Jubilee should do this episode again with you in it and just deny that your pewdiepie

I love pubg I want to be a gamer but I can’t let my parents down anymore than I have already

Just say sonic06 is your favorite ge and kick out anyone that agrees with you

I don&#39;t like those last 3 wtf

Feel bad for that girl

Aa

Hey how are xbox users not a gamer

Al of them are wierd

i&#39;m a gamer girl i play ashe and jinxi also like music, and vanilla ice cream

Did anyone notice that at <a href="">15:52</a>, Pewds said, “it definitely is the guy that looks like a shoo.... uhh uhh... school... uhhh umm the guy on the left”

I feel attacked as a female gamer... That girl did NOT deserve to get voted out like wtf were they thinking?

The three gamers are the biggest betas ever

The boys that voted her out are such beta losers

Man she is master at LoL and says &quot;I love the farming and the turrets&quot;&#39;. What is this.... She also said &quot;master at best&quot; like it wasn&#39;t such a high rank, that&#39;s pretty good rank...

They better have gave the girl money, she literally look out the dude

Fucking hell

It&#39;s funny bc woman can&#39;t be gamers

man this was so obvious lol. Can&#39;t believe they voted Nola out. She literally spotted the fake gamer guy, she should get some of that money. What bull*<b>*</b>

They don&#39;t deserve the money, the girl is the one who deserves

My favorite game is the legend of Zelda breath of the wild

This is basically AMONG US

Pewdipie not gamer?!
SHE LITERALLY GOT THE MOLE OUT SHE DID ALL THE WORK AND THOSE BITCHES VOTED HER OUT

Wait... Xbox owners are automatically not considered a gamer? Hummm...

Strapey

That&#39;s why gamer guys are usually single lol.

DarK soul 3
This was best

does anyone knows king&#39;s valley?

why do they have numbers?? like my gamer tag is just bitty

The gamer is the one with eye bags

Noobs

So glad you left out playstation, yesss im a gamer

Best question for that one how many discord servers are you in

I looked at my shirt it said if I said I wasn&#39;t cool I&#39;d be lion then shows a lion

this is basicly who is not a virgin

“I&#39;m ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ”
games they could&#39;ve also talked about:-call of duty -csgo-valorant-any other game besides league holy fuck

A lot of farming and turrets... Not a gamer no

The guy who said until dawn, I think its him. There was no Veronica. The girl was right the entire time, I love her. Theres no flipping Veronica!!!! They dont deserve that money.

Those three dudes t-posing 100% got each other’s gamer tags and play together all the time now

This girl is a real support. Playing sona and soraka. Doing all the teams work and bringing the mole out. AND STILL GETTING VOTED OUT as in if they lose blame the support. This hits home, her back must hurt so bad from carrying all the guys there

Those last three have definitely typed in EZ after getting 0 kills. What losers, guess they really are gamers lol. They didn’t have to be so cringe with that T Pose tho, shit was hard to watch

Did she say she was master and she sed she knew what turest were im confused...

Pewdiepie: saying i would never say no to a women gamingAlso Pewdiepie: sorry i always laugh when a women says that they are a gamer

How to spot a fake gamer1: ask them what they call pichu2: if they say baby picachu they are fake

This was so infuriating. Those guys were absolute dicks. She should have gotten all the money and them none. Absolute misogynists.

me at the begining: IS THE TIKTOKER

Me playing league while watching this: Felix:  Not a gamer

if you have an xbox your a virgin if you have a ps4 your some what of a gamer but if you have a pc your gamer all the way just imagine being a ps4  gamer but 1000000000 times that that&#39;s what being a pc gamer feels like. pc is the mega gaming platform nothing can top it not even the xbox series x and the ps5 combined can even come close to how good pc is. pc is like Jiren  xbox series x is like Vegeta and ps5 is like Goku if he did&#39;nt get ui.

there&#39;s no way that one chick is master&#39;s

“this guy is a gamer cause he has an unfunny shirt”pewds merch:

Here is the way to spot the fake gamer.&quot;I will ask you all the same question, whoever answers correctly is a gamer, and those who don&#39;t are likely fake. Each of you will whisper the answer to me one at a time. What is the Konami code?&quot;The fake gamer will definitely not know the answer to that question. If you have to google the answer, you&#39;re not a real gamer...

Did anyone notice that at <a href="">15:52</a>, Pewds said, &quot;it definitely is the guy that looks like a shoo.... uhh uhh ... school... uhhh umm the guy on the left&quot;

Boy and girl start arguingThe other guys:start t-posing

The fake looks like the guy from blues clues

body language 101 dude on the left side is crossing his arms which indicates hes defensive and uncomfortable with the situation plus he cant hold eye contact

I’m ashamed to have those three in the gamer community

this must happen with youtubers

Borderlands 2 is legit my favourite game of all time. Grew up watching my brother play the first game and then the second one. Now I&#39;ve been playing it on and off for 8 years 

MUST WATCH @  TOWER OF HELL FUN VIDEO

LMAOOO Haven’t laughed this hard in a while!

pewdiepie alone his roomalso pewdiepie: let me finish my sentence

I guess it&#39;s true, gamers are sexist lmao 

You should play Skyrim again

sa <a href="">3:25</a>

Pewdiepie: the one thing gamers do have unfunny shirt Me: look down sees I have a shirt with the same joke

Damn they were so fucking cringe

Hey Felix I’m literally wearing a shirt with a yeti saying ‘Just Chillin’

They&#39;re not a gamer without eyeblack

Girls can&#39;t be gamers so they were right. and all guys are born gamers so the &quot;non-gamer&quot; guy is just indenial.

I think they thought to vote her out earlier because she was disagreeing to aggressively with someone about a game they knew nothing of. But later on? Didn&#39;t seem fair man...

&quot;Master at best&quot;(as if she&#39;s not that good).... VOTE OUT NOW SIGN!

<a href="">9:53</a> But I do remember, uuuh, some very thic-<i>uhh</i> bigjumpscares in the game

dude how did that first girl hit master? She litterally said: there&#39;s turrets

The triple T-pose showed that they wouldn&#39;t split that prize in 4 ROFL

I feel bad for the girl, she made them win and the nerd gamers kicked her out.

It&#39;s the first time in a jubilee video in which i see a player completely destroy the mole and im so disappointed the other players are such dumbasses

I am rat man and I would like to inform you about the end times

The bright dryer unintentionally reject because odometer systematically repair besides a devilish sheep. neat, disagreeable pipe

just ask what is AFK ?

I have 2 of those exact unfunny shirts

She rly said Master but calling Ashe ADC  

Those dudes suck
Apperently Xbox players aren’t gamers? « Cries in 30fps »

Damn losers would vote out the actual gamers ‍️

Think everyone: It was the girl&#39;s fault for standing out (which in these vids is a bad idea) and for not getting with the three guys&#39; program, which allowed for them to vote her out of reasonable suspicion; if she had teamed with them, she wouldn&#39;t have been voted. everyone blaming mysogyny in this (and JSE&#39;s) comment threads are thinking that they&#39;re big brains, but in reality, creating an issue that doesn&#39;t exist in this particular situation (especially if you even try to see the grander picture) are, dare I say, SMOOTH BRAINED SIMPS!!!! Get over yourselves, and get some sun, simps.

pewdiepie: has wife.aother guy: I am gamer and ave a girlfriends.pewbs: not gamer!!!!

PewDiePie being sucks because one of the gamers has a girlfriend while he’s a gamer and he has a wife

you know when they&#39;re gamers if they play minecraft

WTF HOW JESSICA COULD BE A MASTER ADC

Pewdiepie: &quot;Rate your favorite Dark Souls game.&quot;Me: <b>hasn&#39;t even considered buying a Dark Souls game</b>

im a mobile gamer because i can aford a pc

<a href="">15:30</a> thats what I call a pro Gamer move! XD

<a href="">1:38</a> me looking down at my &#39;half hot half cold todoroki&#39; t-shirt. Not funny.

Felix: sexism is badAlso Felix: everytime a girl says she&#39;s a gamer it makes me laughNo hate, love you pewds

If I need to know if there a gamer I see there posture i see there console they play on and I see the games they have

fake gamers they dont play minecraft

I love Pokémon so much dude it is not funny already I like the dude with the skeleton shirt

Way to proof sexism in the gaming community

They kicked her out because they were threatened, she was articulate, logical and had a good method to actually try spot the mole instead of hiding in the shadows or pointlessly peacocking. This video is an example of why woman can&#39;t win with these menchildren.

why do u lowkey look like avicii
U said jubilee and I got a juvilee

<a href="">2:26</a>: I love how proud and happy the one that answered was after he came up with an answer.

Guy: It was the couple, the bitchy girlFélix: FairMe: That’s not fair! How is that fair? If you played the game countless times, which he said he had, you would know the names of the characters. Also which couple? Matt &amp; Emily? Mike &amp; Jessica? Chris &amp; Ashley? There’s a bunch of couples in the game smfh

One Word: despicable.
Jesus is king 
of course they kick out the girl who carries the team. ugh stereotypes

That’s like winning an e-sports competition and not giving your best performing teammate any of the prize money.

I 100% trusted Bryce because he was into niche games I thought the mole would have said that they liked generic games like league but he said he likes 90s horror games so I trusted him

All they needed to do is bring up minecraft and watching pewdiepie play it

Everyone mad about the ending is right BUT to be fair she didn’t even raise her hand to end the game and the bond the boys made just by T-Posing must of made them trust each other 100% and I’m pretty sure you’d be happy if you won money by doing absolutely nothing

i have a theory. The favourite Souls game may be the first one of a gamer. Maybe i&#39;m saying it because i love DS2 and i&#39;m crying in pain since <a href="">5:57</a>

Of course it’s the girl voted out like always they even knew in the last round it was not her but still voted her

Pewdiepie:Gamer Not A GAMER
They did no justice to any of the girls lol

These guys are dumbf*cks really. Throwing out that girl who basically earned them victory

I&#39;m cringing about bryce bout the red truck and blue truck&#39;s holy shit! 

Pewdiepie: “he is a gamer and has a girlfriend huh”Also pewdiepie: is a gamer, has a wife lmao

Lol I can believe Pewds is going to feature on Odd One Out on Jubliee after all these reaction videos 

I think battle dome was a mode within Pokémon emerald? I remember similar modes in other Pokémon games

Hmm

And some of the comments were so disrespectful they said the girl was bitchy and that taking all the money was a “pro gamer move” what the fuck

The girl is out because if you are too good you are a hacker. Gamers&#39; logic.

I would be like which Minecraft is your favorite 1  2 3 4 and tell them they can&#39;t pick the first one and if they don&#39;t pick up on the trick then they are not a gamer

Pewds: he&#39;s a gamer and has a girlfriend?Marzia: am I a joke to you?

You can tell by his hair bro he an eboy

the first girl wasnt a gamer

I just got insulted by not playing games on pc

<a href="">1:44</a> I’m sorry what 

pewdiepie:I SMELL CAP
<a href="">15:08</a>

Me not even wearing a shirt at the beginning like:

Big red flag to me is how recent that dude’s most memorable game is. Nostalgia bias is too strong for it to not be something you played when you were young...Also not knowing facts about your favorite game is awkward.

The girl did get screwed out of some cash, but I would’ve done exactly what those dudes did. I don’t know anything about Until Dawn so I would’ve just seen two people arguing over some very basic facts. Vote them both out, take an easy win. You also get more money when there’s less people at the end. She didn’t deserve to be voted out... but it’s a game eh what are you gonna do.

This is literally among us lmao

perfect intro

They vote her out so they get more of that pie  smaaaart  lol

PewDiePie : when Here a Woman say she is a gamer i laugh

Nah they don&#39;t deserve one single penny give it to the girl

I KNEW IT
That was so annoying, wth she&#39;s the one who discovered him. They knew it and singeled her out. Losers

Bro it’s so easy to find out if they are a gamer you gotta look at there set up and headphones 2$ or under = NOT A GAMER, also why didn’t they ask “name all the shortcuts on the computer”I’m so poor I can barely run minecraft and me wanna play halo

The purpose of league of legends is not to farms and turrets it&#39;s .....To play assassins to make the game unplayable to marksmen

<a href="">15:50</a>pewds: it&#39;s definitely the guy that looks like a shoo... school....uuhggh the guy on the left.

Felix: whenever I see a girl say they are a gamer it makes me laughSSSniperwolf:  ️️

Just fucking ask what graphics card they have, INSTANT WIN!!!!

Great vid.

Apparently the combination of being born a male and doing a T-pose with &quot;da boyz &quot; outweighs any confrontation a female could make with the mole.

Great vid you always inspired me

I knew he was the mole, because he is gay.

Where did your hair go

I have a feelings its because she&#39;s a girl why they eliminated her she literally figured out the mole  she knew her characters but some guys think girls can&#39;t be gamers so they chose to continue the game just so they could vote her out and they voted out the other girl first these&#39;s dudes are just sexist

not gunna lie almost all of them sound like fake gamers trying way too hard

Not sure if sexist about pewdiepie laughing when the girls say that they&#39;re gamers   like I was born to play ngl lmao. I grew up watching my brother play and about 4 or 5 I began playing games. May not be no MMO or shooter games, but I do consider myself a console gamer, Nintendo,  dead by daylight, you get the idea. Don&#39;t be like pewdiepie in the scenario 

Some random guy:-I have a girlfriend and              I am a gamerMe:-you&#39;re a gamer and have a gf sus This guy is imposter

Just look for that spark of joy in there eye, that’s how you know they haven’t wasted 1000s of hours on a computer.

most people &quot;it took him 7 years to beat a pinball machine, that&#39;s a bit too far&quot;karens &quot;it took him 7YEARS TO PLAY A PINBALL MACHINE GO GET A LIFE DONT WASTE IT LIKE YOU ALREADY HAVE&quot;Gamers &quot;7 years sheeeeeeeeeeeeee that is some serious dedication&quot;Pewdiepie &quot; 7YEARS TO BEAT A PINBALL MACHINE!!!! Nah man respect respect

Its not possible for a gamer to have a girlfriend

I am a gamer because I play a block game on my 10 year old laptop

If you’re gonna lie and say until dawn is your favorite game and played it countless times, YO OBVIOUSLY AT LEAST WOULD KNOW WHAT THE MONSTER IS EVERYBODY KMOWS THAT LMAO

You know they are gamers when they kick the girl out

<a href="">13:28</a> true gamer moment
It was a d*** move

Pewds: Hes a gamer and has a gf.... Suspicious pointsOther Pewds videos: MARZIA!!!!!

Im here!

Ive never played dark souls

<a href="">0:40</a> guess they feel dumb now

<a href="">11:13</a> she lit his ass on fire looooool

This is irritating

Felix flexing for 20 mins cringe
Yellow and blue striped shirt, and green skeleton shirt formed an alliance

I know I’m a gamer because I play dark souls 1 3 not dark souls 2 because it was  not what I was thinking I was thinking  that it  whould be better and i. play.  The Batman Arkham city I have not played the  the other ones yet and I play the  dragon ball z games and Nioh 2

The girl did all the work

2025️
Wait you need to have a stem account to be a gamer? Cuz I play on my Nintendo switch or my dad’s old Mac..... I’m broke ok? I can’t arord a expensive pc

Sad minecraft noises
Him: console players are not gamersme:F*CK you

I wrote this with my nipple:D

Pewdiepie making women joke <b>CANCELLED</b>
Swedish guy is so funny lol

Jessica sound so much like Charli D’milio

where my fallout people at?

It truly boiled my blood when this dude tried to bs his way through until dawn

Guys were like ya but splitting money 4 ways is not enough, we need to kick one more and...we did all T pose together so i know we can be trusted

That was cold blooded, that girl needs a go fund me

I’d be so pressed if I was her

<a href="">15:50</a>

gaming gatekeeping is so bad. if you play video games youre a gamer

League not  a gamer relatable

This reminds me of among us because they vote out the person who is obviously not the fake

the battle dome in Pokemon emerald is a place where u battle against equally and sometimes better NPCs

Good video

No COD players?

The battle dome in Pokémon emerald is a facility in the game with some of the toughest Pokémon trainers, that’s what he meant

he&#39;s a fake gaymer

wait playing on my ps4 means I&#39;m not a gamer even if i get on every day

the girl with the flower shirt took it way to seriously

When they voted Jessica I be like sir I&#39;ve won war zone 17 time no joke I play GTA I play horror games aka fnaf plants vs zombies won mincraft close to 20 times I won bed wars 23 times and I play fps games so

my favourite game is the last of us.... gamer points?

“I walked so you could run” words of a true gamer

OK I’m sorry but did he just say if you have an Xbox you’re not a gamer like what he’s basically saying you have to have a PC

Those three guys at the end don&#39;t deserve the money at all. It was so obvious who the fake guy was, but they didn&#39;t do anything to help and voted out the one who did all the work

pewdiepie thinks that its sus to be a gamer and have a girlfriend but pewdiepie is a gamer and has a girlfriend

If I get this game correctly there is no reason to stop playing. If you eliminate more people it means more money for you.

LMAOOOO at the gamer dudes allowing unjust behavior by the gamers in the video; y&#39;all part of why gamers are being looked down on smh y&#39;all bring embarrassment sm.

Bruv greedy idiots

just realized if he shaved off his beard he would look like Jack Manifold

<a href="">0:51</a>Felix: let me finish sentenceLiterally no one&#39;s stopping you, you&#39;re recording, go on

Dark Souls II is legendary game, dear sir. Fuck off now. xD

Xbox Gamers are GAMERS

In the beginning of the game the two sisters have to die so that should have been his answer right away

The mole looks and sounds like lil huddy

I don’t have a game boy advance. SONIC ADVENTURE 2 is on GameCube

Nobody&#39;s gonna talk about how he almost called the guy on the left a school shooter?

The girl is more gamer than all of them combined

You can tell men ain&#39;t simps. Savage.

Pewdz: this guy is a gamer and has a girl friendMe: Dude you have a literal wife mate

So you don’t think girls can be gamers I’m not a hater I just want to know

Sims pathetic
I can spot a fake gamer anytime

Lol you hide that you play video game

I will marry a gamer lol

I love gamers

Every one should play game lol

I watch pewdiepie I am gamer
The one who says I play and enjoy Minecraft they a Og gamer

Bruh I thought it was the girl because she said gameboy advance for sonic adventure 2

<a href="">15:54</a> Felix really had to hold himself back to not say sCH00I Sh00T3R

If ur a real gamer, ur subbed to pewds

i hvent playd any singel game in 3 years and idk why bt i know i been watching anime

Slender Man sucks
Solve it with a simple question: Saints Row or GTA

Fallout gang?
Top 5 Most Infuriating Betrayals Of All Time:

<a href="">1:38</a>my shirt literally says &#39;my crystal ball says ur full of shit &lt;3&#39; 

When PewDiePie says Xbox players are gamerThe entire Xbox community: sad

When he said fake gamer I was like And Bryce is a disgrace

you know they’re gamers when they can’t accept a woman is better than them at something and find it sus

I resonate with <a href="">1:07</a> so much lol

lol

Feel bad for the woman... while everyone else was being a total introvert she found the mole won the game for the 3 remaining guys and yet they still kicked her so she couldn&#39;t have any of the money... shame on them, they don&#39;t deserve anything

Jessica looks like a valorant player
<a href="">7:48</a> well u are a gamer and u have a wife so...Impostor

they totally deserved dude they would&#39;ve done it in a actual game too, good gamers aren&#39;t simps

theres no veronica

Haha she does not get the money lol 

Im a gwamer

Uff the Girl was like a 20/4/11 Adc and  the Rest of them were inting saying &quot;Bot diff&quot; at the End.

Wtf. They are the worse people ever. With that iq how they can be good in any game. Those three just dumb

its <b>a m o g u s</b> but gamer version

I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS but... pewds has a point we can&#39;t STFU

Pewds is sis of gamer with girlfriend and he is married coincident I think not pewds is not a gamer confirmed

that girl smurfing! unfortunately she got 3 guys running it down mid in her promo... she still carrys but they report her after and get her banned. clownfiesta... 

<a href="">0:52</a> I love how people not from the States talk!

They didn’t deserve the money

I&#39;m the person looking at my shirt like, &quot;Ah god damnit.&quot;

Pewdiepie “I would never say a girl can’tBe a gamer”.     4 minutes earlier “ I laugh every time a girl says she’s a gamer” lol

Fuck my shirt dude really unfunny shirts

Surprised they didn’t do fortnite

He&#39;s the gayest thing I have seen this month, of course he&#39;s not a gamer, I knew it from the beginning.

Bruh these guys and girls aren’t a gamer except the girl

<a href="">13:40</a>

those guys probably knew the mole was out already but took the girl out to get more of the money

<a href="">1:37</a>Uhhhhhhh.....

no no no i gamer
Did anyone feel personally attacked when he said people don’t shut up when Kingdom Hearts is there favorite game or is it just me 

Is ps4 gamer

the 3 incels voted the girl that discovered the mole

You probably had a taste of what the girl felt if you have played among us long enough

who thinck that jubilee is jolibee in first filipinos haha

<b>AFTER THEY VOTED HIM OUT</b>IT WAS OBVIOUS, HE WAS THE SPY!

this dude literally gets 10million+ views on a daily

Me still watching: it is between flowers and green

None of them are gamers because they don’t play minecraft

These dude gamers were sexist from start to finish yo, I&#39;m not sure about calling myself a gamer now.. or wait, all the gamers I know irl are the coolest people ever. It was just these guys that were TWATS

HWY DID NOBADY SAY MINECRAFT!

Randon guy are you a gamer me MINECRAFTRandom guy I trust you

Pewdiepie: he a gamer with a girlfriend hmmAlso Pewdiepie: Married

<a href="">7:40</a> Felix, don&#39;t you have a wife???

Wouldn’t it be fucking hilarious if they do 5gay men and 1 straight they find who’s straight but here’s the catch their all straight

i am no longer a pewdiepie stan for this video.

People trying to defend the girl after she lied about the character names which is the exact same thing the fake did

Amogus
That episode had a corrupted government

That blonde girl cant be playing league how could she say her rank is master? Her describing the game was so weird too

Talk about halo

Me who is not wearing a shirt but still is a gamer

WHY NOT MINECRAFT

Bro I legit wouldn’t care if they kicked her out if they did something. This is like kicking the guy in your team who did the most dmg and kills. Bruh

The best game is Bedwars.

Surprisingly Haunting is a game

Um

Those three guys probably planned this from the start

<a href="">1:38</a> but I’m not wearing a shirt :((

If u didnt play on the wii, then u are not a real gamer

You know he og when they say they&#39;re favorite game is cod bo2

Haunting a genesis game bruh

Find the person who doesn&#39;t smell like shit and doesn&#39;t live in their mom&#39;s basement that&#39;s the fake gamer

Pewdiepie: he has a girlfriend and is a gamer suspicious Also pewdiepie: is a gamer and has a wife

Why they eliminated her???Cause you never play solo in a  squad. You may play against but not with.

Boys will be boys

I played COD once so I&#39;m epic gamer

I have th same shirt so I MUST BE A GAMER

I play games on PC, switch, and my phone. Am I a gamer?

<a href="">3:39</a> league of pubg???

how to hell did the flower girl know the characters in a HORROR game( a genre she hates).

Normal people: l play Minecraft im gamerGamers: i play games to <a href="">1:00</a> and then  go to the fridge for food and and continue playing

your a gamer and your married

I can’t believe pewds is a minority

that was my i hade that unfun shrit XD

Pewdiepie is himself a gamer AMD married and then he threw sus on the guy with a gf

they voted her out to take all the money hzha

the last three guys make me want to die

absolute fucking gamers T

Among us don’t be sus

The ginger is pretty sus, its to much the meta of the gamer

This Guy called pewdiepie is definitely not a gamer.

Of course the one who carried them got called out

<a href="">7:20</a> as a kingdom hearts fan I just gotta say he fucking nailed that assumption lmao

me- <b>sees what pewds last searched up</b>also me:  <b>After 10 years from when that video was made pewdiepie doesn’t know how to edit videos</b>

I&#39;m smelling bullshit

Boy gamers: vote out girls just bc of gender, keep saying that girls cant play, is sexistAlso boy gamers: wHy iS ShE nOt gOiNg oUt wITh mE

No I play overwatch

Most girls don&#39;t even reveal their gender while gaming tho, too much bs to wade through when we do, so I understand the incredulity when a girl comes out and says she&#39;s a gamer.That, and some genres are more popular with guys, so we don&#39;t interact in the same circles.

ur hair
Its bryce, he looks so proper and clean.

ppop

Those guys are thug life dude 

The silent root correspondingly examine because process postauricularly guard throughout a oval alibi. bright, shrill chronometer

Girl votes mole out the boys vote her out

Anyone who mentions darkest dungeon is definetly a gamer

Make them play cod war zone and see their reactions when they die

I’m not wearing a shirt 
Wait if u play games on Xbox ur not a gamer but what about pc

It’s still like that in Sweden.

Pewdiepie&#39;s a gamer and has a wife. IMPOSSIBLE!!!

they shoulded have asked what games they know

It’s AMOGUS

<a href="">2:29</a> not even an actual T-pose 

<a href="">2:29</a> not even an actual T-pose lmao

The more real gamers they vote out the prize pool for whoever’s left shrinks

Them dudes did nothing.  and they get the money???

LMAO at <a href="">15:50</a> he was bout to call mans a school threat

I was loving the striped dude and the ginger having their adorable friendship but I am LIVID that they voted out Nola after she did the leg work. That was her win. She was ROBBED.

He send he never would say women can&#39;t play games in that exact sentence he sed woman can&#39;t play games 

Being a gamer in sweden is like being gay in Iran

Nah bro everyone was against gaming but now look, damn 3 mil game tournaments.. Anime also use to be super cringy but the rappers normalized it with there mvs and cover art

I play fortnite

Why locked
There is a imposter among us
