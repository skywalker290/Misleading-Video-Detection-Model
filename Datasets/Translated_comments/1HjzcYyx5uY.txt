The weigh-in is over. Who ya got?

Money may whooped that azz

<a href="">3:08</a> 😄😂
Conor was in his prime there, incredible, this guy would be the goat if he didn’t fall bcs of the money earned in this fight…

Floyd mayweader is a personality, he was always sure he would win
Floyd rushed to wear those shoes before face off to get a few inches leverage . Lol

↖️🔥The Hardest Hits in Boxing &amp; MMA History🥊
I dont know much about boxing but why does this seem so unprofessional? The weigh in mister and other staff throwing around random curse words and stuff

Floyd is very cool

Good fight

floyd sock man =]]
How is no one talking about his boner

<a href="">3:02</a>

Floyd didn&#39;t even cut weight

Jack Paul Logan Paul , youtubers and many MMA fighters want to recreate this and copy this sooo badly but little do they know that there will never be another fight of this magnitude ever again cuz they&#39;ll never be another McGregor or another floyd.

conor walking around bricked up 😂😂

Conor behaving like a barking dog elergatic street dog😂😂😂

Mayweather was on peds for sure.

The fact this man is on the top 3 most viewed/popular videos on this channel and based off of weigh ins is crazy

Friend

My dream weight 153 pounds
If only the duel between the two of them took place in the MMA ring, not use a boxing rules maybe the result would be different

There was vitually zero chance for Connor to win, however he sold it well to his fans.

WOW

Conor Krasaucheg raised the UFC to the skies and thanks to him many learned about Floyd Money Mayweather
<a href="">3:14</a> even Floyd&#39;s manager was amused by Connor&#39;s antics😆😆

HGH to the max.

Dana white at the back his like this is the best thing ever $$$

And everyone thought Floyd was taller when it was only the shoes

Conor was def packing way more than Floyd 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The guy doing the scales is a savage to everybody else, but is super nice to Floyd. 🤣 Even though Money was the one moving and flexing. Lol

The white guy is packing more than the black guy😂You see that myth isn&#39;t always true😂

Years later, still gets me how floyd and Leonard Ellerbe thought Conor had missed weight…. The shock on Leonard’s face 🤣🤣🤣🤣

The craziest fight ever 😂

nice

<a href="">2:47</a> Mayweather wearing elevated shoes 🤣😂

Tepassiiiiiii 😅
CONOR fans, LIKE this comment :):)
Man you are not god no matter how good you i will only support Connor McGregor under any circumstances no he is my man,

Bro is Conor actually packing like that. MF look like he got a ruler in his pants got dam.

Floyd actually got in shape for this. His last few he&#39;s been out of shape (for his standards) but he got ready for Connor.

Clown

Conor having a woody and Floyd laughing at him about it!🤣🤣Joe and Big John mentioned it and I didn’t believe it,Conor was just super hyped or did it on purpose for the world!😂💀

Well.

the scam of the century

FUCKING FAGOT this is McGregor...... Down bitch...
McGregor= 🤡
Floyd needs to dress as a woman and fight in the women leagues, to prove men don’t belong in women sports.

Ellerbe&#39;s reaction when Conor made weight may be my favorite weigh in ceremony moment in boxing and mma 😂

🐐

Cather at mericaine
lol Floyd always puts his shoes back on to have an extra couple inches height

These two guys knew how to put on an event

Straight wipeout 😂

They already fought on Floyd&#39;s field, now let them fight on Mcgregor&#39;s 🥱

Can&#39;t believe this was 5 years ago.Still remember the hype for this match

Talk when chabib reach at this level …

Be sure to try and know how to sell a piece of pottery
1:96 YOU CAN SEE IT JIGGLE YUM

Ayo why did Conor get hard bro 😳

where’s the full clip where mcgregor flex’s and puts his bulge in front of mayweathers daughter 😅

The love of money. Not money, the &quot;love&quot; of money has destroyed many a good person. 1 Timothy 6:10

What money
why use those stupid manual scales??? Just use electronic ones

The Waffle House Has Found It’s New Host

I don&#39;t know what was funny the face off or the weighing dude getting pissed 🤣

Shorakorugu
Mcgregor was excited to see mayweather or he had a banana in his pocket

I hope indian arabic IS satellite racism terrorists don&#39;t raping and don&#39;t attack humans. I believe indian arabic IS satellite racism terrorists attacked many humans and maked lies and deception accusations against humans and spacestations familys other stars

Give me that MMA rematch 🇮🇪

Why does Connor have a hard on lol

Conr is dying to express like a madman
Praise the LORD for kind relationships!

What if Logan Paul, the WWE wrestler vs. Connor McGregor, has never competed before?
win or lose that massive pay check is all what mattersyaaaaAaaaAaaaaAAaaaaaaHhhHhHh

Over confidence

You think whiskey is gonna save you connor~khabib

One of the greatest boxing matches in history ❤

Is this 5 years ago already 😕

<a href="">3:15</a> that dude with the glasses finally laughing n relaxes cos he is shitting himself the entire time.

Impressive physique of Floyd Mayweather, without a doubt the best and most disciplined boxer
Floyd was trying so hard not to laugh 😂

Floyd blinks twice after face off: man that’s some bad breath 😳

Crazy Floyd looks considerably taller 🤔

Floyd vs Conor, ready Floyd won, now it's time for the rematch, right? in a UFC ring, fair right?
To bad the irs took his money from this fight 😭😂

dude how is floyd so insanely shredded at 40 something years old

I wanted to hear what they said with the sound off, which was pretty scary.
I never talk about women and never look at them , and think that they are useless in those events , but just one thing...Here was much better looking women than UFC silicone-botox 🐖💩👎 lousy parody❗

Mayweather may have won in boxing but we all know who would win ina street fight.

Conor was a clown man

I love u the Notorious

Eh, scary...
Full bokki grass
Even the Japanese cannot understand why Mikuru Asakura fights Mayweather.He is not the strongest Japanese MMA fighter.

So much nostalgia 🥲 whatever they say, this fight put the spotlight back on boxing, the whole show at the press conferences and how people who were not even very big fans of boxing or the MMA approached these sports, simply great 🔥🔥
LOL lol
It's hilarious to talk so much, make your crotch swell, and lose.
He has no prestige, Connor.. Arush
Love the calmness of TMT

No, it's big
The breath that comes out from deep within my stomach is hard even if my breath isn't bad when I'm this close.
The best thing is that they behave like little children! HAHAHA
Mr. Conor McGregor is something, this is the highest, I passed
floyd be like when you know your opponent is a cripple in your field :D

I need your support, friends

Stephen A smith is the worst analyst I’ve ever heard quite honestly. This is why First Take will never be as good as Inside the NBA.

Man. Only guy I’ve ever seen to win the face off against Mayweather

Real to Death BRRR ILLUMINATE
150lbs?  How tall are these dudes

Hype train express 👏🏾
Just like the stand off on the Egyptian wall

Although he lost the match, McGregor overwhelms May with the size of his penis.
So0sow0apwoapw a9ap
Here c intimidated floy I no longer saw him
McGregor copies the Jake paul

Conor slabak
The best

This was the first and last UFC match I ever actually cared about. The build up by the media and UFC themselves for this fight was generational

His wife's family's fortune is wonderful. Everyone is so affectionate with each other 😍
Still can&#39;t believe people paid to watch this legalized fraud.

That’s how you win a face off.

floyd mayweather

You fooled millions of people!

Looking at the comments makes me dizzy
It was amazing how many people gathered at the weigh-in.
For me a big money deal! to see if Connor, the new kid on the block, would beat Floyd, one of the greatest at his own art!??? my opinion $$$$$$$
Your dick is too big

FRAUDE

McGregor genius marketing
🤨I got faith McGregor will be back😐.

Everyone knows Floyd bet on himself and made it go to the round it did...

All the people booing looked dumb as rocks after the fight 😆 🙄 sheesh!

<a href="">2:13</a> is that Mike in the red suite?

The Real Fighter vs Clown 🤡

Noone can beat McGregor in mental warfare, even Floyd felt it, though he knocked him out. That man&#39;s a maniac and gets you thinking...

This was 4 years ago?

Conor never wore light colored boxers to a weight in ever again

Flodymaywather🥇🥇🥇🥊🥊💪💪🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆👍
McGregor 👎
mcgregor came in armed
Conor the manI pick Conor McGregor

2022 and I'm still waiting for Floyd's shit to get into the octagon
If it's an MMA match, Conor could kill Floyd hahaha
And Floyd took care of business as the true professional!!

Maybe Mcgregor weighed slightly more because of his underpant situation

Conor weigh in: RAHHHHHHHConor After match: 😨

Conor: Trash talkFloyd: silentResult: Conor destroyedConor: Trash talkHabib: silent Result: Conor Destroyed

2 egos met each other. the only thing big about these 2 is their egos, one has a mouth bigger than brain until Khabib shut him up, and the second thinks that he&#39;s greater than the Great Mohammad Ali.

Too cool...
The man was like &quot; Stop movin, back Tf up&quot; 😂😂😂😂

To me the video started at <a href="">3:26</a> I had to skip through the non-important stuff

<a href="">0:15</a>

Manike is lost 😁
In a man's fight the white eats the black...boxing is dead...
2 clowns

his mother broke him
Let Floyd get into the octagon, he can't last 1 minute. That was pure business. They would have even agreed to 5 rounds
Business

Irish dbil
Still one of the best

mayweather looks chill

Mcgregor is the best Mcgregor is the legend.

I heard Floyd Manny Mayweather 😂

Mogregor is sick with a cachtadon, I can't stand it
Look at me looking at the fascists, the same way Floyd looks at McGregor.
if it were an UFC event, floyd would not be that confident

Say what you want. But Conor did it.

Damn business they did! $$$ pure show obviously the mediocre millionaire was going to win!
Floyd was like: Kid, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna hit ya! 😁

That was just a money fight I guess, otherwise Floyd can never win over a average mma fighter.

I&#39;m still waiting for a rematch but in a UFC match but Floyd won&#39;t do it

Revenge en free fight
The beating he gave to Magregoe
What a stupid god man
what a joke
You would never win a fight against me I DARE YOU
look at those skinny calfs on conor dam

did floyd miss weight?

We already know the result
Trash...

Conor gonna knock this other guy out. Easy work

My work
He couldn&#39;t break Mayweather in the stare down the fight was a joke don&#39;t get me wrong but at that moment when he couldn&#39;t get floyd to break is when you all shoulda known floyd was too composed for him

We all know that in mma mcgregor he kills floyd&#39;s black man

before the plandemic

Conor magrigor bibi

U cant believe this fight happened

<a href="">3:09</a> Conor: <b>AAHHHAHAHHHAHH</b> Floyd: your breath stinks

Hellow

More meat on a butchers apron.

I WAS AT THIS FIGHT

Evil..both of them

Dafuq why’s his preek hard though?

what a barrage of punches that Connor took...if it continues as with Kabib the money stolen against chosen weaker opponents and I say weak because as soon as they put real expert fighters on him he got hit...returning to his wealth if he continues like this he enjoys it with broken bones...
mcGregor is sincerely on the c ......!!!exhibitionist !!!

Conor would be one of the craziest fighter in ufc history

I don't get bored watching McGregor🔥
Conor, I'll show you what happens next
People  can Like or dislike  McGregor,  but the bottom  line is he put up a Heck of a fight!! - and without  his Moxy and talent, the Mma wouldn&#39;t  be near as popular  as it is

Conor is fighting too much...the DLM show has a lot of representation all the time
two assholes to fight. a waste of everybody`s time.

Only condor would face up a lady like ronda sousey

Possessed by the god of this world, the devil, only Jesus can free and break every bond.
Conor can destroy Floyd in Mma octagon

Matan Ribirin HS 👉🥊👈
Conor sure likes to laugh

What a poor exalted man
Floyd only won cause it was boxing if it was in the octagon conner would win also if floyd fought khabib in octagon floyd would lose bad.

Genesis 3:14-19King James Version14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

I hate  thisover smart  conor

Mayweather put on those snickers ASAP, they are both short .

Love it, Connor stood up to chicken running Floyd. Floyd was roasted, he got a good taste of his big mouth

Mcgregor 👍👍👍
I mean, ...I understand...but sorry, I'm used to weights of a much different size !!!!!Here we're talking about masses around 67 - 69 Kg. Better poor, under a bridge, and without MARONI, but at least 100 kg of muscles like a REAL man!!! What a scandal!!!
For me, the worst boxing fight in history, that was pure business.

Justin Bieber, who has a lot of strength, kills Manuel. I want them to train Justin Bieber, so that someone weak will suck up to Manuel Duarte, taking away his desire to live.
You taught me everything I know about being a poor, humble girl and that they beat her up and on top of that I'm not strong like you. I don't want boxing or kimboxim to exist anymore.
mayweder I want to play with you I miss you dad
Tell my dad Mayweder that he gave me a smoothie to drink that he gave me bones with honey and delicious food and chocolate milk that I love him and that I was crying screaming daddy daddy why did Manuel Oscar Duarte sent by Nicky Jam hang me and try to kill me tell Nicky Jam from Puerto Rico deserves a beating like that

Who’s watching after hearing that Logan Paul is fighting Floyd Mayweather?

Mayweather was pronouncing the laugh

Hey guys! I wanted to share something with you. Lately depression, hatred, etc., has taken over the world, but there is someone who in the midst of all this chaos can help us, he knows what is inside each box and that someone is Christ. He came to earth and suffered for us to forgive us our sins, to give the possibility that whoever repents of their current path and is faithful to his word until the end, will be able to meet him one day. He will cause those who are saved to live in peace and happiness, 0 afflictions for eternity. So much so that in the apocalypse he left the promise: I, the Lord God, will wipe away all tears, there will be no more pain, suffering or death, all the first things have passed. Jesus has the power to help you with any problem, as well as the Anyone who believes in his name and follows the word of God, because he has power! Anyone who has doubts about it, call us on Instagram: 👉Christus_Dominus_Noster👈God loves you👊🏻

Kevin Hart Will Beat All Of Them With Height Of 5.4 &amp; 1.63 Inches😂

Connor looks like he&#39;s about to eat Mayweather&#39;s chin in the thumbnail.

<a href="">2:55</a>That is the safe distance to prevent covid 19 transmission infection...

This guy's boxing is really good compared to the UFC, I don't want to take credit for it, but what does it mean to be like the Tasmanian devil 😂
Floyd “THE CHICKEN” Mayweather!!!

Well if this two fight on street we all know who will win. Connor all the way

Aren't there any Turks?
Conor Mac Gregor ridiculous clown smokemonger
Say whatever you want , McGregor brings a different kind of entertainment and energy when the devil is inside him.😂

Purely bad pubiciti but the fight was very bad 👎👎👎👎👎👎👏👏
Imagine that kind of hype from mcgregor but against pacquaio. And pacquaio just smiling , goosebumpsss

ladies and gentlemen this is now logan vs. Floyd Mayweather

The girls with corona on their bras

Wite vs niga

Man, anyone you put after Floyd is instantly loved by the crowd no matter who it is lmao

Now let them do it the other way around, Mcgregor agreed to box, now let Floyd get into the hexagon to fight Mixed Martial Arts to see how he does.
What a short guy
Konor 😂😂😂

Why they censored weighing man telling people to back off and f**k off

Let&#39;s take a. Moment of silence where the weigh in  machine was from WISH shopping.... bruh🤣

That was set up.
This is on your recommendations 😃

everybody&#39;s gangsta till obi wan mcgregor fights mayweather

I like it how McGregor just screams and Floyd just stays queit

Mac looks like merle

<a href="">1:37</a> i hear that : too short , too short 😂😂

This arrangement is for ¡@_de pe/€@
I hope Mayweather made a fortune because he taught a master class in boxing.

Fck yeah,Connor Muggregor

I don't know what I'm doing here in 2021🤣🤣
Conor is just sick
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life&quot; (Jn <a href="">3:16</a>&quot;But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)é

That viking warrior blood kicked in.

Zvz zzz&#39;s
I wish they could weigh it on grandma’s store scales. fucked up. Electronic ones are too expensive?
i can see how people wanted Floyd to lose

<a href="">3:09</a> jajajaj

The battle of the douches

How could anyone think Conor had any chance to win this. You must be really dumb to think that. A guy who beat 14 world champions and never lost vs an amateur. It was never a fight, just a show and Floyd bet on himself to knock him out in 10, come on Conor lovers. The best boxers in the world couldnt get a clean punch on him and you think a ufc guy is going to? Lol. All a business

floyds fake laugh is cringe

Corona. <a href="">2:59</a>

Back the fff... back off

Who’s here after watching jake Paul pretend to me mcgregor at his weight in 😂💀

floyd looked sooo shook! hahaha

Pspn

Conor is always with his show-offs
Gregor is firaun  🤣

Why is no one talking about the dude who&#39;s weighing Floyd?

Thank Floyd for your big $ tool
This fight is crap and trash just like the fighters.
But in an mma fight... oof

Jvgfuj xmhghx

CONOR McGREGOR 💪👍
CONOR Mcgerogor

Money beating up rat

If Floyd fights him in the UFC he would still win because boxing is also very complete.
The worst fight I have ever seen in my life and I knew Floyd would win.
I&#39;m pretty sure that floyd says (in silence) uh so stinks (when conor screams in front of his face)

Floyd May weather is better

Let him face him in my UFC and see who wins😂😂
The fact he’s wearing paddy power jocks is funny

Remember he fight with big show

Connor sniffs dust AKA Artur Shelby
HAHAHAHA

This was the fight that ruined his money and took away all his desire to train.
Both of them won money wise. Both were so smart how they planned this.

If there is a more idiotic guy than this Conor, I don't know who is more stupid Son of an ass
Imagine being undefeated and still no one cheers for you

I'm so excited
Whenever conner get oversmart, he get kicked out

Up Next: Pacquiao vs McGregor
McGregor thinks he's a very badass with his buttocks and his rump standing up.

So stupid

Conor McGregor will be remembered as a gready man, comercial and nothing else. He brought nothing to this sport, he simply installed greed there and nothing else. He got beaten up every single time. The shame of Europe.

Poor Floyd 😂 made millions but he will never forget this

Mayweather's weigh-in is messy
Xc,,,

The guy looking at Floyd&#39;s weight had enough

Simply miss, someone who runs, warlord, someone who goes out to conquer and fight like a man.

Nd Floyd defeated him !!! That&#39;s why Don&#39;t celebrate too early

Conor👎👎 Floyd👍👍
They are literally going to kiss each other 😂

What I see is that Mc Gregor did have the balls to accept or ask for a fight in the ring while the other does not even dare to enter the cage with him.
Perfect show

If this is UFC fight mayweather can&#39;t cheat and run anymore because this is in the cage connor mcregor wrestle him

No one see this mans pants

Floyd Mayweather is the best fighter ever. A true legend. Unbeatable!!

Look like WWE

Conor M. is a legend in his own mind....but not much of an MMA fighter or boxer.

<a href="">2:57</a> who their Connor, we ain&#39;t camping buddyNo reason to pitch a tent now

Conner knows he attracts fans
I think that they face each other in their field at McGregor and they will see what a beating they will give to that guy who had a disadvantage, poor friend.
Conor would have defeated Mayweather if the fight was taken place in UFC

<a href="">3:27</a> I’m down bad rn

Very cool
6 A Christian is like a soldier who is destined to die one day for his country, if possible. The day the call resounds to go on the attack, everything on this earth has no meaning, it is not only his money or his home that is at stake but what is most precious to him, his life. That is why they must be ready for the General's call. And it is not in a month, nor in a year but today. The Bible and the vision confirm this so in the 1993 vision, they see the Lamb who is the symbol of sacrifice.
Stupid show...everybody knew the winner before the game played.....

IF IT WAS JUST ME WHO NOTICED THAT MC GREGOR WAS EXCHANGING A &quot; IDEA &quot; WITH SOME BLONDE LIKE THESE ON STAGE BEFORE THE WEIGH-IN KK

Nokaut - Leave now (Music video preview 05/11/2020)
the big mouth just screaming then crying like a joker for the fight. just lol

It's like when you try to do a deep thumbnail kiss, but the other person thinks it's French and it doesn't go well.
KHABIB vs Mayweather......hahaha....u knw how awesome it would be....both undefeated

this felt like it happened months ago, can’t beleive it’s been 3 years

<b>It&#39;s so painfully obvious that this was such an instagram&#39;esque&#39; just for money fight....</b>there&#39;s zero tension and Dana isn&#39;t even there to break up the staredown lmaoo.completely opposite to the Khabib MCGregor staredown.

why they just don&#39;t use digital one ?he is having a hard time reading Floyd Mayweather weight HAHAHA

Le me get your weight bro
I like McGregor's provocations, unlike others lol
K habib andalan

The boy to boy to boy boy

I'm so nostalgic for this fight, I was from that time, I wanted so much to see Floyd back
It's cute that he doesn't mess with anything, which gives me a sense of respect.

Konorr

Mr satan.vs neymar jr
Clown vs Clown

Nothing worse than being over confident aka cocky and then you lose

Big
A truly capable hawk hides its claws
Wkaowka

What is wrong with  Floyd and his father

Mcgregor is king

On the way, May's hand touched McGregor's cock and I was worried.
Konoor💔💔💔💔🤤🤤

cleveland browns

Okkii
McGergor is very conceited
If my weigh-in was this exciting, I would be motivated.
a
Awesome
The sad thing about it is that he did all that and still lost

that white guy was being over the top
