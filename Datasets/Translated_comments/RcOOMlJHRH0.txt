Hats off sir. You have written that my age is hurt but in your acting you look like a big and responsible man 
Love you bb

Bhai u r correct  me khud ek baap hu pr mere betta 10 me fail fir v use mene Ninja x10 dila kr di mere a laaal he to sab he warn nothing

These videos are the reason that makes me YOUR DIE HARD FAN

BB same situation like u. I used to take tension for less marks. Parents never scolded me for that but it was all in me.I&#39;m still in the same situation in the last stage of my studies.

Bhuvan Bam is such an artist, who can make you laugh and cry

I wish it really happened 
Thanks yr Bhuvan.. Abhi had the intention of quitting the race‚Ä¶ but now I am not 
Gg....bb nice one
Nyx video 
Pata nhi bhuvan bhai aap in purane videos ke comment dekhte ho ya nhi par aaj Yeh video achanak recommend hui currently going through a lot of situations and this video just boosted me up kabhi bhi Mein stress ya depressed hota hu aapke aur ashish bhai ke videos chala leta hu bhale hi kitni purani har bara hasa dete hai love you BB

mind blowing video...very wholesome....one of the best eyeopeners...and i literally cried on this one!! Love it!!!

The feeling is relatable
Nah. Only the score matters as it decides your future. No future, no life. So, it&#39;s better to work hard for a great future &amp; do whatever possible for that. If you still don&#39;t get what you struggled for, your life is in your hands. You can morph it. So, tatakae!

Love BB you are best

It‚Äôs 2023 and this video still makes me cry..If you are reading this comment Bhuvan sir.... Thank you for this video and god bless!!

Understanding this video in 2023 ...

Kaash sabke parents ase ho 

Brother, why don't you app, there are no labs to rate 
Damn, it was a deep message, Thank you so much for always making us laugh. Loved it.

I was 65 so I was dancing.
That's right 
Till today there was a lot of laughter on every video of BB but today brother made me emotional by telling the reality 
Rila diya bhai

Showing reality through humour 

Had watched this when I was in class 7.Back then I didn&#39;t even know what failure looked like. I am understanding this now when I am not able to prove myself. Still I have that hope inside.Thanks bhuvan..

Idol for a reason.

really , he deserves , what he is today;

<a href="">3:56</a> It's been 3 years since I completed 12th or I might as well feel like I said it behind the numbers.....
My parents have been saying since childhood &quot;If you don't have good numbers, your nose will fall apart, your hair will be thrown out&quot; And now also you say it lol
I am also 54 years old on 10th 
I love my father, he always protected me, supported me in every way, never made me feel less than anyone‚Ä¶.there is no wealth except my father‚Ä¶what is the matter of time, what is bad today is good tomorrow. b will happen......
The only video of BB in which I cried ...



needed this so much at this moment. thank you bb&lt;3

It's been 4 years, 1 year left
We all need thinking of Babloo Jii...

This is the way I failed in 11th when my parents loved me  I have been working since then (not in mobile)  Just told me Ô∏è
Ma ne bhi haar dekhi  ha bohat dukh hoya samaj chori mere to apne bhai bahen ne mujhe rulaya mera mazak banaya jab mere result ki baat karte the to baher se to smile de kar baat taal deta tha lekin room ma ja kar akela rota tha mere school walo ne mere samne mere baba ki baezatti ki ki dukh to bohat hua dill kar raha tha inke school ko jala du lekin baba ne gaari ma akr meri bezatti ki tab mera bhi dill yahi kar raha tha ke apni jaan dedo

BRO YOU ARE MY INSPIRATION ONE DAY I WILL ACHIVE THAT WHAT I WANT ......INSHALLAH

<a href="">1:57</a> That&#39;s line 
Such a lovely video 

Made this video 20 years ago
bb is something that is to a next level

I don&#39;t know why I am not trying hard I have everything money for books , college, etc. I don&#39;t have interest in studying but my father tells me without studying nothing is possible. I don&#39;t know how to communicate with people, no friends, no one supports me. I fight alone. Sometimes my parents scolds me,  but in exam results time they don&#39;t....... i don&#39;t understand why God made me 

I failed in my 12th std board exm got 46% but still failed in phy n maths.Left studies coz didnt wanted to make Career through it.1 yrs completely drp out until covid came n made things even worst ! Again 1 yr drp out.I was 2 yrs behind in my lifeThen reality hit me up, understood things, become wise and now I&#39;m in my final yr preparing for MBANot sure whether I&#39;ll crack into IIMs but I&#39;ll surely land up in 1 of d top B-schools in IndiaAgain I&#39;ll come on this channel till then wait for my comment coz only in this video I felt myself not a die hard BB fan but this this is d perfect gem of all BBs creation 



Brother, you gave me the pain of this time,,,,
mujhe test mein 65% mile the..mein tensed tha...but intermediate mein 93% hi aaye...BB just got me real.

And after this vdo every forgot it nah , thats not what we are supposed to do. Let&#39;s take the initiative and start the awareness. Lets do and prove it can happen in india.

I am in my 10th right now and needed motivationThis gives a next level of confidenceNow I know I am going to Ace it To every hustler every student Just Keep your hardwork above everythingAnd you will reach the top

Very well but I am fale in 2 standard 
This video is fully opposite in real life

Brother, I love you dear friend.
Miss u papa shab ji 
Till date gives me goosebumps and motivates me every single day. Bhuvan bhai I love you 


Bhai saying true story 

Utube recommended this in a correct time..always love u bb

I haven't seen anything in my studies. It is very predictable when comparison is made. And whenever I see you, everyone asks me '39; engineering karni hai?&#39;
Why is everyone thinking the same thing?!?!
Watching after 4years

It's been 4 years since I watched this video. Do you ever get depressed after watching it? I had failed in 12th but today when I look back at the past, I feel that it is good that life has shown me respect for the first time.
&quot; The weight of the stones of the society has become heavier than the weight of the books &quot;
Bb is also legend with no gali and double meaning... hosiyaar hai

True: not everyone think like this

Heart touching

Here after 2yrs... Can&#39;t control my tears...love you gem&lt;3

Thissss wassssss your bestt videoooo 
Great story 
He proved that everyone has different talent 

What is this song of piano?
Best motivational video Please pin

Bhai all parents should watch this one video of bb Ki Vines

This type of father is blessingsBut ...This is only a character Ô∏èÔ∏è

I guess this is the only video of the channel where whole family can watch and they should watch!

THAT FRIEND IS NONE OTHER THAN ME.....................................

BHAIYA YOUR BHOT HASAYA MAGER Aaj Sach Me Rula Diya 
I wish everyone had a father like this... 
Only if i was courageous enough to send this to my parents

father of motivation
Wow....just   
Bhaiya we love you

Hit like if watching between 12Am-6Am

Brother, if everyone's parents take exams then it is important to know that the child will never commit suicide.. One is to fail, the other is the tension of comparison with relatives and the same is the strange taunt of family members daily, a failure student is known as Kaali Raatein. How did you die alone?
This guy has created history just by talking himself salute u brother god bless u 

thank u

Love you bro  for motivation
Mujhe ghanta phark nhi padta 

I love this video  thank you

2023 legend 
Heart touching story bhuvan bhaiya

My friend in my childhood was very smart and topper in his class but one day what happened in +2 was that he scored 60 percent and then he became very sad and committed suicide. It is true'incident
Brother ruled today
watched this four years ago, but didn&#39;t connect with the meaning that much. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I loved the video even back then.. but after four years when I have faced so many failures since last year, I&#39;m crying so much after watching this. My parents are very supportive. but still, I just don&#39;t want to be a disappointment to them anymore...

One of the best video on bb ki vines 

Maa baap Aisa tabhi keh pate Hain jab unhone apne bacche ko mehnat karte dekha hota haiNhi toh generally bahar ke disappointment utar hi dete hainPersonal experience hai bhaiPehle lagta tha mere maa baap aise nhi HainWo mujhe dushro se compare nhi karte Par wo tab tak tha jab humare sab se jyada acche result ate theJese hi mukam se thoda niche utre toh pehle toh expectation pe na utarne ka tag lagaAur ab sach me lagta hai &#39; sab kuch ek bar mein ruk jaye&#39;

Agar parents bhuvam ke papa ki tarah supportive hoge to suicide rate kam ho jayge

Exact same situation;percentage , friend mark
This video must pass through my family as soon as possible. It has created a burden of books for me.
15/07/2023Today i just gave my college final year paper CC13 . I am in 6th sem bsc math honours student  but i hardly ans near pass marks besides my handwriting is not good so i am in worry wheather i pass this last sem or not.I have never failed in my life .if i fail in 6 th sem it will be my first failure in my academic. I am feeling headache  i have 3 more paper CC14 ,DSE 3,DSE 4 .i can&#39;t concentrate in study . I have lot of dream but perhaps it will break now..Hey god plz make me pass  in this year. I want to complete graduation this year . After seeing this video i am crying . What i will say my parents friends.what teacher will think.. Life is not easy  for anyone. Feeling helpless .Sorry father , mother ,my elder sister .(Perhaps noone ever thought that I can fail in xm as i was school topper. But school , college are not same , lot of factors matter)The pain  which i am feeling now can only be felt by a person which is now in this situation.Ohh GOD. (My exam ends in 24/07/2023). 

Very hardworking 
Fuck society

So emotional Ô∏è
This point every peoole got good marks then mi

I watched this video 2 years ago for the first time and cried like a child.Today, 28/06/23, I got my Third Semester result and I got to know that I got a backlog in mathematics.For 1 hour I couldn&#39;t find out how to say this to my parents. My father called in the night and I couldn&#39;t resist myself from telling my mother and father about the backlog.  And I started crying like a child .And my mother said &quot;Ki hoyeche backlog peyechis toh, jibon sesh thodiy hoye gelo, kanna bondho kor ,jibone badha to asbei ,keu tor pase thakuk na thakuk,tor maa baba ache ,er besi ki chai tor?I&#39;m grateful and blessed to have parents like them.  I will definately bump this after 5 years.

Mai ro gaya cz i relate to this.. ngl mai hi wo dost hu.. mereko bhi suicidal thoughts aa rahe hai 

Or mere maa bap khud samaj ki. Tarah toxic ho gye .. jbki ghlti education system ki thi 

Only 1% parents watch bb ki vines

Love you hogya

If you keep looking at others' plates, you will always find yourself eating less.
bb is best actor in youtube

We need parents like bablu jii
I wish even i had such parents.

Pain is felt by the one who passes heart Ô∏è hota hai! PR mere pass to heart hi nhi hai, i don't feel pain any longerÔ∏è‚Äç
Brother, I have found my heart 
I wish every parents could think like this

reality hits when you understand there was no friend it was bhuvan&#39;s feelings all along

Everyone loves these parents 
This is soo deep. Parents sometimes can‚Äôt understand the effect of there words nd support towards the child. At that point children become vulnerable. Help people around u, u don‚Äôt know how much someone need to have a polite conversation. That‚Äôs oll u need to do, just say THEY CAN.

Hi, bb vines. Maybe you Won&#39;t even read my comment. But yes, I am from Bangladesh &amp; going through my admission phrase very awfully. I have already disappointed my parents &amp;...i can relate with everything that Bhuvan us feeling right now. This video, just made me feel light. I think the thoughts that are in my head now are common but exceptional would be to pass this phrase..Thanks buddy üáßüá©Ô∏è

Deep meaning 
Don&#39;t cry while watching 

This helps me to get through a lot

Thank you Bhuvan bhai for this video. Giving strength to my failures.

Ye video dil ko chu gayi
And the parents still think that depression is just acting‚Ä¶

Hasane wale jyaad hai hai
I watched it before when it was released and now i had just given my exams finals and this video seems related i lost confidence in myself i tried and still if i don‚Äôt succeed it didnt seems like to work hard

If life is as easy as this, then I will not eat it, I will feel...Ô∏èÔ∏è
Best video 
BB sir emotional video ......hai yeh heart touching 

The best ever moral video I had ever seen

BB be like ; Timepaas ni hora chlo kisi video ka thumbnail change krdeta hu

Friend, 75% is there.. and the rest is 80% above.. it is feeling very bad because Papa is not able to feed the sweets of happiness. Everyone else's parents brought cakes and sweets for their children, but I was the only child... My sisters are all smart and have reputation in their schools, I am not respected. I didn't even realize that the woman who made me was not even a penny. My parents don't even know what I am, even though I have told them 10,000 times. There is no support... I am much more beautiful than you.
I wish my parents also stayed like this 
Watching this just 4days before my board result.I don&#39;t know what will happen to my results but i definitely got the inspiration form the video to face the results.

All mothers and fathers are not like this, brother 
I came after failing
I have tasted defeat, sadness is too much, anger is my solution, I was in front of the destination but could not reach it, but again I will run towards the destination, will keep running, and this time I will keep reaching the destination, the destination will change. This time the fun of the journey is long, we will reach again, we will come back again, on this comment, we will definitely come back.
<a href="">2:53</a> i got almost cried
This video made me cry. For the first time BB made me cry

Rula diya yrr!
Bhai tune ye sare thumbnail badalke ekdum gadha hag diya hai ekdum bkwas

No matter what Parents are our biggest well wishers. They protect us like the roof on our head and teach us like the best mentors or ever. Support us in every way possible. In all manners they are the real one who cares for us 

Every Indian parents are like Bablu ji you have to show the brighter side of your&#39;s to your parents. they will fight with god to save you if you share all talks with your parents

Mere parents NE to kabhi mujhe padhai  ke liye kuch nahi kiya kyoki vo mujhe pressure nahi Dena chahte the Love you  parents

<a href="">3:53</a> I realize this thing

I don&#39;t know about others...but this vodeo made me cry

hey
77% of these are just a lot of sadness in life
Babloo ji just realized he is not talking about friend he&#39;s himself,, and just see bablooji&#39;s face expressions Superb

I failed today in 12th
This gave me goosebumps
karliya bhuvan is not smart
This is the defferent between... influencer and youtubers... proud of you BB

Bro 4 saal pehle ki video but still as fresh as morningAaj hi result aaya mera91 hai par estimate se kam aayePapa mummy samjha rahe the ki bahut achhe marks hai but mai khud naaraaz tha But ye video recommend hui and mujhe realisation hua and moment after that I  tightly hugged my father Thanks bhuvan dadaFrom a young fan...

i m literally watching this after 4 years...and the fun fact is that soon my class 10 boards result will be declared...i m literally in the lowest point of my life because i know my parents are not supportive and they will not be okay when they hears my result...i m trying my best to keep myself strong 

Just at the time all i can say is you cant change what has already happened but you can definitely design whats about to happen and you never know with a better future you may rebuild your past!

Watching after class 10th board result 

Watching this video for the first time in 2023 my exams are going on and same is happening with me I am not a distinction Wala student I am an average guy you made me feel relaxed thank you mr bhuvan such videos have an impact beyond the time they are made With love 

When mother and father are not with me then they are against me.
Watching this after my class 12 result

Aaj 12 th aur 10 th ki result ayu h bahut sare bacho nko ye smahna toh padega hi

I got 89% feeling sad for only 1% left for 90% benchmark 
Not all parents are one.
I am lucky here that my father always support me like bablu ji , i got 58% in 10th and my future plan was to took a science and every relatives said to my dad he is not a science student but my dad never listen to them , in 12th i got 45% even after that i got a admission in nursing because of my father he never listen to anyone and today i am in canada , i cracked ielts and now i am happy with my life , so wherever i am today because of my father Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

this video literally made me cry love you bro this is such an amazing video. This is so freaking relatable man and the way you showcased babloo ji......... i have no words for this<a href="">2:39</a> this is the time it hit

Yes Ô∏è
I literally showed this to my parents after I got less percentile in jee mains.... And the way they responded was golden... Bhuvan you have their respect 

Bablu jii I need a father like u

Truth : even if bb k vines abuses but those words have a deep meaning 

Rip to those who showed this video to parents after failing the exam

happend to me i almost jumped from the 5th floor but this kept me not too!

My feelings after exams. I also have feeling to quite but also have feeling for parents. Once my atya savede me by dying by current .

This time I got 99 marks in my prep class and my father got very angry.
I salute you in Guruji's footsteps.
Not all parents are like bb&#39;s parents .

It&#39;s reality 

My friend committed suicide the same day our 12th result were announced just because he failed in maths.The most cheerful funny and entertaining kid in the whole class commited suicide after failing a single subject.I couldn&#39;t believe it when that happened.

today may 2023 result of board and i passed in all sub. but somehow my friend failed and i send this video love you bb dil se

The sad part is that here 90% are students

After the board exam results are out, all the parents should understand that relatives or paroshi are making fun of their children due to low numbers or failure at that time.
Bhuvan bhai looked 3-4 times and started crying again.
Brother, not everyone's parents think like this. And if you are from a middle class family, you have one option to do a job and improve your life. I also got 80% marks in 10th and my relative got 88% marks. But my mother just said to me, look, they were the same 88 years ago. My mother always said that she set such an example for other children. It will happen. And whatever she said made me feel that I was not a teacher, that I was not telling my mother's mistake but I was talking about myself. And father says that while watching the movie (3 idiots) he used to say that numbers do not matter, knowledge matters but with time everything becomes cloudy. I can't do anything that I like, as per the society the career option is doctor, engineer, government job, etc. We middle class people have to choose from these people who do not always ask what they want to do. When the number comes or when the study stops, my father tells me and sometimes my mother also says that let's get you some work done at a mechanic's shop. They think that this silence will make them read but they do not think what will happen to them due to this silence. Literally brother, he did not cry from the spring of numbness, he cried a lot from walking. Sometimes it seems that we have come into this world to dance to the tune of society. It feels very bad when my relatives tell me the number of their children when they have passed away but it does not happen many times but my mother tells them the truth because she does not know how to tell the truth. And I didn't even speak, Brother, I would just say that if my father died the day I left this world, I would wish that I would never be born again as a human being. The circumstances that are going to happen in those times will not be tolerated. I felt very worried that no one would understand my children in the future. Kass jaise isme apne dikhaya waise hi mere parents ham sabhi ke parents hote‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ .

It feels different when you are un such conditions 

Crying, why don't you see me, Papa, I am feeling like a child myself‚Ä¶ I have betrayed you just by making myself happy.
Bhai maa Kasam rula Diya re tune  love you Bhai 
You are really great

I was in a happy mood but brother did not rule.

Thank you so much for this video BB.  Whatever you mentioned in this video, it&#39;s all true. I was a failure in high school, gave 5 re-tests. Everyone taunted, said I&#39;ll not be able to achieve anything in life.Now, after years, I am a manager in an international company and earn more than 70% of the students in my class. I can say that I laugh when I look back at myself. Never thought I&#39;ll be accomplishing.

Watching before 2023 boards 

love u bb 
&quot;Your marks are completely proportional to your income &quot;This line is a pure lie but the biggest problem is parents do not believe this and they also don&#39;t want to believe this.This is not their mistake , it is the mistake of society which made this stereotype and attached in parents mind

I really started to crying .. when I watched it..

I just cried for hrs after watching this video

akmoast cried nice video
My life flashed in this video 

Not all parents are like this...

Literally cried while watching this

Awesome video 

5days later i have my boards 2023 ..and i am scared what if i cant get above 90% then i came across this video. Thank u very much I am a PCMB student i failed in 11 ,i even failed in 12 half yearly and periodic exams and in preboards i got just 21. Most of the relatives or elders blame Online EDUCATION FOR THIS . I STUDY FROM LAKSHAY NEET BUT PROBLEM IS I COULDNT DO REVISION AND PRACTICE PROPERLY due to Backlogs .But Now I solved NCERT, did PYQs ,just more revision left and i hope to score 90% without taking the tension what will happen if i dont!!. THANK YOU BHVAM BHAI FOR THIS VIDEOTO ALL THOSE WHO WILL WATCH THIS COMMENT IN THE RECENT DAYS, some of u maybe in better situaton than me ,someof you maybe in similar situation like me , some of you maybe in worse situation than me. BUT MORE THAN SITUATION WHAT MATTERS IS DOING THINGS EFFECTIVELY EVEN AT THE LAST DAYS.. EVERYONE THOUGHT INDIA WOULD LOSE AGAINST PAK IN T20WC MATCHBUT LATER MIRACLES HAPPEN AND VIRAT JUST BLAST IT OFF.SO yes please at this last days ..make a concise list what to do and how to do and mug up if u cant rememberand for those whose exms are still more than 4months away . LIFE IS JUST LIKE A SIN GRAPH KEEP WORKING,KEEP PRACTICING,KEEP REVISING

Literally cried watching this video.

This video means a lot for me for my lifetime

Best vedio i ever seen Ô∏è
I love you so much BB :&#39;)Stumbled upon this video on such a day when I was feeling extremely low, this brought a smile to a face. You&#39;ll perhaps never know how many times these videos have saved me. Whatever you are doing now, the success, the fame, you deserve every bit of it Ô∏è

Motivation 
Bro every time I got more than 80percent but this time I got less after seeing my result I was very upset but my mother and teacher said that you got good marks

The part where he confesses about his suicidal thoughts 

How can i miss this vedio

This the called content

this video is 3 year ago when i was 15 and passing from pain buz my pain die and maybe i dont see  this video but i understand this video to much

Teen saal Baad bhi dekha toh ye cheez itni relatable lagi (FYI: Ab mei job krta ho isliye bola), social pressure logo ko zindagi bhar rehta hai, toh isliye always see yourself &amp; try your best, never compare with others (because they also do) be unique by thinking .We always compare ourself with others either it&#39;s marks, toys, House, partner, money etc. Or SOMETIMES EVEN LIFE 

i dont know ...but everytime i see this video,it hits really hard.

Bb ki vines video fully of funny ; but this one touch my Heart Ô∏è

This is the only family video of BB which makes feel positivity to the parents.

What will one do if his mother and father are not with him? The answer is no one knows.
His acting is on another level, looks so real, and his message, truly a legendary creatorÔ∏è

Goosebumps litrally my eyes fills with tears thats why i love bb.

That‚Äôs why bb my all time favourite YouTuber who can make us laugh and cry too by his motivational speech 

I am giving my boards in 2023 and I teared up while watching this cuz the amount of pressure a child has if both the parents are educated and the child has facilities is too much for a child to handle single handedly

Parents in parallel universe

idk how yt know what i exactly need in this moment i was crying because i was streesed because of my studies and you saved me

After watching this i cannot believe that bhuvan bam is playing all these characters Ô∏è

Very emotional 

This video is pure on YouTube, I can't do it 
Bablo g great father 

I mean parents love but as the child grows older he starts getting responsibilities and he is also going through the most difficult phase of life (teen) he doesn't know himself BC what is going on with life and unconditional love of parents It appears to be conditional and that boy/girl remains alive only physically but mentally appears to be totally dead.
I want to show this video to my father..Now he said, show him the other videos also.
I&#39;m very proud to have such parents 

BB bhayya thankyou, isse zyada kuch kehne ko bhi nahi hai. I&#39;m a single child until I found you, you are like my elder brother. Ek na ek din aapse jaroor milungi bhayya. That&#39;s my aim 

needed this thanks bhuvan 

This had me in tears

All fathers are not like this.
very inspirational bhuvan sir

True words bhuvan bhaiya
sad reality is maa baap khare nhi rehete

Kash mere bhi parents yaise hote 

I wish my parents were also like this.
Brother there is one heart how many times will you winÔ∏èÔ∏è I love uh pls you have to meet me once bro pls

Every student needs supportive parents specially in board classes where everybody target them.

I really needed this video.

Hats Off Yrr
I still remember when I used to get less marks than my parents expectations. But my dad always believed me. Still he says that &quot;you have many opportunities don&#39;t give up &quot; . I&#39;m blessed to have supportive parents. I will make u proud dad Ô∏èi commented this cz I will get reminder daily Ô∏è

The pressure of career nowadays makes us have suicidal thoughts

A true story _A boy who wants 98% in exams, he also do hard work but when result come his score is 90% he wants to quit every thing, he wants to suicide.One day he standing on a bridge and attempting but just a old man come and said &quot; why you doing this ? Are you want to start again from kindergarten ?&quot;

I really love you bhuvan bhai 
I cried my friend
You are my reason to laugh and cry

My parents doesn&#39;t understand this 

thankyou
Goosebumps

This kind of parents Ô∏è

This gives me goosebumps... i got tears in my eyes.....bhuvan and his parents ... Feels like they are not character they are real. Real the people who exist ...Suddenly the realization that he has lost his parents  but we are always with you as your family......Lots of love to you Bhuvan

Brother, I have always been angry... but today... I did it emotionally... 
The first video I liked ...Of BB Without any hesitation ...Because it&#39;s a message of a acting father to every parent ....

LOVE you Ô∏è bro and hate you  bro

Same situation  plz.

Thanks YouTube I am in 10th and my pre boards went bad and yt suggested this to me...I will do it

BB KI VINES' BEST VIDEO TO DATE
Bhai so inspiring rona agya!
This is the first time i cried after watching bhuvan&#39;s video

BB first imoshnal lesson 
I have learned this lesson from this that I should not give up, that is why I am still working hard, it is my full responsibility on Allah that I will definitely get success in this day and night, Ameen.
I m watching this still, bcoz it is better than 1000 motivational videos

2019 me 12th hui thi meri.....below 80% percentage ke karan dukhi thi papa...11th me bhii kuch khas nahi the marks....phir indore se 12th ke baad galat coaching se NEET ke liye drop liya....covid bhii aagya....puri pdaii ki L lag gaye aur 433 marks aaye... obviously phir dukhi hue vishvas dikha kar ek aur drop dilvaya....NEET 2021 me time management nahi ho paya phy tough thi isliye...usme 542 aaye aur government college milne se 3 number se chuk gya tha..... the worst phase of my life ...bhut bure thoughts aaye like bhuvan said ki uske frnd ko aarahe the.... somehow i managed and result se next day i told my father that I&#39;ll do whatever he want....to do MBBS from private college... or to take drop...or to change course or to indulge into father&#39;s business....tab unhone bola ki tumhari marzi hai to ek aur baar karlo try, now is year ki NEET me sirf unke trust ke karan 650 marks with AIR 4326 aaye and obviously now I&#39;ll in AIIMS .When bhuvan told ki safalta ki asli kadra usko hoti hai jo pehle haar dekh chuka hota hai hits me hard, and actually it&#39;s really worth it when you get success after failure Just want to say keep your hardwork in right direction with right aim, definitely you&#39;ll see the outcome. Ignore your sadness and just say &#39;Humare saath shri raghunath to kis baat ki chinta &#39;Ô∏è

I wish my papa was also like this my heart got melted and just made cry  I wish my papa also understood my problem or my difficulties 
Great

Brother I don't want to go share this with everyone
He knows his responsibility well . Good bb.

I also got 65% in my exams and it was least in my friends circle but I overcome that failure and get the good marks later, and then this video released by BB and I was smiling that how accurate is BB here!!!!.But Now I am again in that phase which  is worst then before and I can&#39;t even smile cause I am not having any motivation because of stress. I liked this video at its release time and somehow it pop up at my screen. Thanks BB for such kinds of words  

This guy must have scored average marks but is earning far  more than the toppers combined 

Who alse open YouTube just for watching BB KI VINES  (‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†)
The video I watched 2 years ago .... I cried and I watched it again today and it repeated again ..... cannot express but this touched my soul 

Love you Bhuvan
