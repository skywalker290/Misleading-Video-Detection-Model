even the stormtrooper missed its fucking steps

Not only is are they not good with their blaster aim while wearing a helmet but also they step… aim..?(Possibly fun but I don’t know how you would feel about it personally fact: stormtroopers are well trained, that includes shooting. The reason they cannot shoot well (aside from plot convenience) is because the poor visibility from their visors are screwing them over.)

<a href="">0:11</a> &quot;don&#39;t worry, I know force heal.&quot;

Where is this at?

I warned you about stairs bro i told you dog

Thus we witness the fall of the Empire...

This clip foreshadowed the fall of Star Wars quite well.

Average cosplayer

not only can&#39;t they aim, they also can&#39;t walk

Whenever your trying to act all cool to impress people:

I burst in laughter for 5 minutes

Daily life of darth vader

His helmet popped off like something out of LEGO Star Wars!

think of this video everytime I walk near southern cross haha

The Empire&#39;s Finest

Why’s he wearing a sock over his head? 😂

I find your lack of balance disturbing...

Guys this is fake

Joe Biden stormtrooper
Aren’t u a little fat to be a stormtrooper

Staged for views.

i feel so bad for this guy :(

This explains all the stormtroopers   Eye problem

He fell
Nah

At least the armor did it&#39;s job 😂

It’s not just aiming they’re bad at, they also suck at walking down the stairs.

The armor did its job...

<a href="">0:05</a> with you every step of the way

Sigh. A symbol of Disney&#39;s Star Wars.

Looks like the armor wasn’t very protective after all!

That’s why you always hold onto the rail.

Me when I go to a new school expecting to get new friends but the girl tells me to install Tinder and basically fuck off. And I&#39;ve not been to school ever since for 5 years now

He was saved because he was wearing armor, but he wouldn't have fallen down the stairs if he wasn't wearing armor.
Damn, that looked brutal. Glad he&#39;s ok

Bro like a lego man
they realy can&#39;t see

aw my lil bro used to replay over n over laughing so hard at this

bro refused to die

It’s been years since I last saw this video and it still cracks me up

I bet this is the same dude who bumped his head in a New Hope

Trying to walk down LGBTQ stairs as a straight..............

Joe biden as a stormtrooper 💀

&quot;Ayo the Pizza here&quot;

“You seem…unsettled”
At the he was wearing a helmet 😂😂

This pretty much sums up the Sequels to star wars

That&#39;s storm trooper aim in pain

You gotta give him credit, he got back up and walked away like nothing happened

Why is this so funny.

Is it just me or did i randomly remember thid video

<a href="">0:05</a>

<a href="">0:05</a>-<a href="">0:11</a>

🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥 fake
<a href="">0:13</a> how has nobody mentioned everyone saying “you alright” like 10 times

The force was not with him

Dude rolled pretty well. Probably got away only with a bruise or two.

It&#39;s the excessive plastic jumbling noise that gets me EVERYTIME.

&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;

that one storm trooper who can&#39;t even enter the battle before dying

DOWN D STAIRS

I thought it was animated

Well it was in character

Guy now knows first hand how much it sucks to be a storm trooper with those vision limiting helmets. Guess you can say that helmet is faithful to its lore.

<a href="">0:00</a> When dogs used to run wild as fierce beasts<a href="">0:05</a> Dogs getting domesticated by humans

Stuntman, practiced fall.

Why does it looks like if it where a actual scene from star wars😂

I made a stop motion where the predator gets hit by a car,and rolls on the ground,and now I realize how similar it is to this

ayo da pizza here <a href="">0:05</a> my ears burn
That&#39;s why you wear armor!

Lego breaking sound
Bro&#39;s helmet did not live up to its functionality

<a href="">#Fake</a> You can see him intentionally lift off his helmet while he is tumbling.

Be honest, when was the last time you&#39;ve seen a Stormtrooper have a shootout on a flight of stairs in the original trilogy?

That made me laugh so hard

And thats why you use the handrail.

Is the helmet okay? Hahaha.
Anyone know where the location is?

<b>Bwaaahahahaahhahahahaaaa😂😂😂😂😂 NEERRRDDDD!!!</b>-Me in the background if i was there probably

Yeah but is it okay?
That is why we were helmets.

Kind of annoying how you can tell it was staged

Ayo intergalactic pizza is here Oh <a href="">0:05</a>
omori reference
Sucks that he damaged his armor. That shit ain’t cheap

This is a beautiful metaphor to describe the Star Wars series as of 2015 onwards.

I’ve made a few costumes and I am screaming internally right now.

Me falling downstairs be like:

Sums up modern Disney Star Wars pretty nicely.

Aparently aiming is not the only problematic thing about them. They can&#39;t see sh.t in that helmet.

The clatter and the fact he kept going down the second set of steps had me...Rolling.

Pretty much sums up on Disney handled Star Wars these past years. It was good at the beginning, until they tripped and fell.

Nice aim trooper 👍
So this man swan in the water with a shark and then took a picture with a tornado and now he’s witness a selfie stick fight and also saw a storm trooper fall down the stairs after watching the Star Wars premier?

The Emperor of Disney had this Trooper executed immediately after getting on his feet😢

And remember kids, that&#39;s why stormtrooper armor was made.

The bottom of the stairs says “with you every step of the way” and they were literally with him every step of the way

And yet he still missed the stairs. 🔫

thankfully the Stormtrooper &#39;&#39;armour&#39;&#39; helped

That was hilarious but I really hope that guy is ok

Wow . . .  If only Evel Knievel had that kind of break away armored suit . . . Might have saved a few bones.

luckily he had armor on 🫲😂

Thats not the step you were looking for.

Looks like the armor actually helped.

DUMBASS!!!!
I&#39;ll bet HE sure felt the &#39;Force&#39;

Well of course, you can&#39;t see see $hit with this helmet on 😂

Disney fumbling the great saga in history:

he had so much bad aim that he couldn’t even go down stairs without falling

Imagine this was in one of a movies 😂

Oh my god. 00000 is that funny ha ha ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha he he he he he he he he he he he ha ha he he he he ha ha ha ha
Technology japanese be like

watch in x2

Then he had to watch the Force Awakens. worse day ever

This is Star Wars in a nutshell. It started out great - and ended in pain and embarrassment.

This was more entertaining than the whole trilogy with Hayden Christensen

It’s like a premonition from the real Jedi force of what What’s to come for Disney after they joined the ASG score society and woke Agendas…. BEAUTIFUL

Only time a stormtrooper ever got up from falling down.

Stair Wars

Dude walks  away like I’m not going to acknowledge what just happened

Omori reference
Bro slipped like he was falling into the sarlace pit💀

Aren&#39;t you a little clumsy to be a stormtrooper?

Its a fake. It falls, but cuts to a humanless skeleton. At the bottom it turns back into a real person. Editing. There is a slight jump. Watch closely

More entertaining than 7 of the 9 films

my comment of &quot;do it again&quot; was deleted ?

Best star wars movie ever

Mind your head.

Probably he missed a step.

This is a perfect depiction of star wars since the first 3

What a fake fall

Down D Stairs strikes again!

I&#39;ve seen this video for fucking years and always suspected which stairs he was falling down, but seeing the &quot;Spencer Outlet Centre&quot; sign confirms it. This is the large walkway steps at Southern Cross Station in Melbourne, at the north entrance on Spencer St

good soldiers follow orders

Take that, Mari

Deliberate, based on him literally throwing his own helmet off.

Honestly, I was expecting him to miss every step.

Theres always a chick in the background screaming 😂

modern ragdolls in games :

he really survived the stormlock wow😮😮

No way The Force Awakens premiere was 8 years ago…

Use the face dude. Use the face 🤣

I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t choke on his own hair.

And thanx bro KING JESUS CHRIST ORIGINAL filming whole thing indtead of catching again..... take how it resonates.....love slide at end makes it more realistic😂😂😂😂😂7

Bytw R2UPGRADED wrote on stairs With you EVERY step of the WAY.... LOL really R2UPGRADED why didn&#39;t your fool ass catch me?????? 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂 SE7EN

Could see outta dam mask......trying to find my brother?????... anyone seen him he&#39;s King LORD Jesus Christ superstar forevermore Original JESUS CHRIST ORIGINAL????...... SE7EN TAC TAX Tic Tac toe s

First steps: Original trilogySecond steps: Prequel trilogy Third steps: Sequel trilogy

Is there an edited version of this with Lego sound effects? Lol

POV: the Star Wars franchise after Disney bought them out.

&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;I hope so.

Poor dude
What an idiot😭😭😭
highly trained profesional

fake

Why it kinda sound like a car crash. <a href="">0:06</a>

When your stormtrooper character falls into a pit in Lego Star Wars:

Ow. Thank God he had cheep plastic armor. If he had actual Storm trooper armor he would be dead.

Summary of this franchise in a nutshell

I shouldn&#39;t be laughing, but I am

<a href="">0:04</a>

LOLLLLLLL

8 Years Later the franchise is dead.

At least he kept most of his gear,  the FriggN stunce

Consuming Star Wars content since Disney took over

Must have been on of the emperors finest troops. Like the legion on Endor.

&quot;I can tell from your worn armor that you&#39;re a veteran&quot;&quot;Uhhhhh....yeah&quot;

What a chode

If they took those helmets off, they could probably see. No wonder they can&#39;t shoot right.

aaaand that&#39;s what a loser looks like!

It Was At This Moment That He Knew He Screwed Up <a href="">0:05</a>

i was there

Luckily he had Plastoid Armor

<a href="">0:05</a> the moment he knew he made a mistake

The step he slipped in said &quot;With you every step of the way&quot; im dead.

aww god
Summarize Disney’s management of the Star Wars franchise without telling me you’re  doing a summary. (Glad the guy seems to be ok).

Looks like the armor actually did its job for once

<a href="">0:00</a>-<a href="">0:04</a> Original and Prequel Trilogy<a href="">0:05</a> Sequel Trilogy

Well, you&#39;re certainly in chatacter.

Never gets old

Its okay, he is from Melbourne. Nothing of value was lost.

When you realize it’s time to grow up

That’s a deleted from Spaceballs

Pwnt

is the guy ok tho?

damn bro killed himself

The stairs that read “With you every step of the way”.

DID YOU SEE HOW HE JUST WALKED AWAY FROM THAT, HUH???!!!  YEAH!  EXACTLY WHY I WEAR MY STORMTROOPER OUTFIT EVERY DAY FOR SAFETY SAKE!

I could tell it was going to happen when he chose not to hold on to anything as he ran down the stairs for some reason. Hope he got checked out because he seemed knocked out for a few minutes.

Honestly, where would be without cell phone cameras? LOL

Atleast he had armour

2 things that can&#39;t use stairsStorm Troopers    CL4P-TR4P

Vader will be pissed...

Omg

Back on patrol

Did the armor work?

How am I the first like

they even suck at walking down stairs

LORD VADER IS DISSATISFIED

Useless. He&#39;ll never be a Jedi, anyway...

Hilarious
When stormtrooper realises they have to aim their feet toward the stairs

Poor guy
The force is with him every step of the way

This is canon

The Force may be with you ..every step of the Way

That’s why there’s railings to hold on to

The little slide at the end 😂

LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO

501st recruit.
GAURDIAN DOWN

That sound was satisfying. Like Lego.

<a href="">0:05</a>

Vader pushed him

<a href="">

The farce is with him.

Putting his helmet back on to cry was such a power move

Sounds like Lego
For some reason this seems extremely accurate to Stormtrooper behavior

the star wars sequel movies expectations vs reality happy the dude is alright

Salute to the troop for losing his life for us

Dam I know that shit didn’t feel good.

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Stormtrooper armor really doesn&#39;t protect you from anything. 😉

Haha put helmet on backwards

poor dude he just tested his new stormstrooper armor i feel the pain for this man

Thank god that stormtrooper had that armor on.

LMAO dumbass
He broke apart like a Lego storm trooper 😂😅
Is that Joe biden

Someone used the force on him

The fact this was filmed in Melbourne kills me lmao every time I walk on those stairs I think about this video

Live long and prosper - The Hobbit

He was so much into his role that he even depictured the clumsiness of the Storm Troopers.

A bad omen for things to come.

So the armor does provide some protection.. hmm ok that’s cool .

I find your lack of hand rail holding disturbing

The EXTRA sounds😂😂

So they can&#39;t shoot and walk down stairs WHAT CAN THEY DO

&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;

Nice cgi for 2015!

Ofc he missed a step you know who he is!

Stair Wars

Err, Guys i think that was Tk 291 Other wise known as Gary.. Welp hes clumsy

You should have added the Wilhelm scream

Quick someone put his helmet back on!😂😂😂😂

Well, at least we know stormtrooper armor protects you better from falls than blaster bolts!

The best I have fallen and I somewhat can get up

sounds like someone chucks a plastic garbage can down the stairs ;)

Sounds like a bucnh of legos clattering together

fake

Could be worse. He could have seen the Star Wars premiere.

“How’s that armor helping you now, plastic boy?”

Pov you played too much ragdoll

The gravitational force is strong with this one Luke.

God that advertising is obnoxious 😂😂

<a href="">0:06</a> dude turned into a real Lego Stormtrooper after losing health

I hope that Trooper is ok because gawd dam that had to hurt.

He misses a step

Gotta use those guardrails, bro!

<b>DUALSHOCK 4 DISCONNECTED</b>

With so many turns, we already know why they have bad aim

He found a way to make dressing up in a Star Wars costume even dorkier.

We&#39;ll be singingWhen we&#39;re winningWe&#39;ll be singingI get knocked down, but I get up againYou&#39;re never gonna keep me downI get knocked down, but I get up againYou&#39;re never gonna keep me down

The exact thing I thought was gonna happen

At least he was well prepared for the fall

Wow, right on his De-Naturizer...

He didn&#39;t fall. He got shot down
RAAAA MELBOURNE MENTIONED

Pure Masterpiece.

So thats what the armor is for!

&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;Every steps:

An impression of Kathleen Kennedy in control of the franchise 😂

Crap! He was looking good too!

Imagine if this was to happen at Disneyland

Stormblooper.

He&#39;s not on the way to anything, they literally stopped to film this.

He miss step.
The way he got up and started walking thinking &quot;  that f**king hurt ffs &quot; 😂

Fake

The force is not with you😂

With you all the way 🫡

<a href="">0:03</a> Ayo the pizza here!<a href="">0:05</a> Oh ni--!

hey, atleast he was wearing his armour

Shockmaster is the first thing to pop into my head...Especially with the helmet coming off and him putting it back on and continuing.

So their stairs skills are roughly equal to their shooting skills.

99 Hp Dealted

😂😂😂😂😂😂 <a href="">0:04</a>
I don&#39;t think I should be laughing this hard at this 😂😂😂

their aim is so bad that they cant even walk down stairs

POV john wick it was brutal for me

He was portraying how bad the sequels are in a physical aspect.

Aah shit that was bad

They see me trippin they see me rolling~

I&#39;m actually surprise he actually managed to hit something.

You know, I’m gonna be honest, I’m surprised that he didn’t break any of his bones when he was falling down the stair, it’s just… wow

i&#39;m sure he has trouble aiming after that fall.

8 years ago!

Given the rather obvious complexities of the situation, this outcome was....expected.

Great stunt
Great. They can&#39;t shoot straight. Now it turns out they can&#39;t even walk straight.

The force is strong with this 1

&quot;Sunny, join the Galactic Empir-&quot;

this is the exact reason why stormtroopers cant shoot perfectly

He missed the step.

Bro was falling for 4 seconds

Must of felt like a dik after that

MELBOURNEEEEE (i was exactly here)

it&#39;s ok he got protection 4 and unbreakable 3 on his armor

Stormtroopers miss everything except the steps on the way down.

this has me in tears 😂

Someone edit this with blaster

I just realised the ads on the stairs read &quot;With you every step of the way&quot; lol

This is at Southern Cross Railway Station, Melbourne Australia. No wonder he falls

ASMR

this is the only time in history the camera man has ever helped the person being filmed

Such a classic video-masterpiece. What a nostalgic wave

He’s fine he has armor on 😂

the stormtrooper then realized that he was on his way to the premier of the sequels, he realizes he was in the wrong uniform for the sequel movies and passes out from embarrassment, causing him to fall down the stairs

The great stormtrooper got serious injury from the battle, but he still win the battle and claimed his victory

The stairs had inspirational quotes

He MISStepped

This guy is one of my favorite storm troopers ever.

At least he had the armor it probably didn&#39;t hurt that much

I kinda feel bad for laughing at him falling but it&#39;s so funny 😂

Pov: when you die in battlefront

Stairs: &quot;With you every step of the way&quot;Stormtrooper: <b>*Fells down of the way*</b>

Just like The Shockmaster

Performance Art perfection...He perfectly captured the transition from Lucas Star Wars to Disney Star Wars.🐸👌🏻

Damn that 🐶🥸😎 stairs , didn&#39;t see it 😵‍💫
Dude should definitely go to the hospital after that and get checked out...Oh, wait, it&#39;s America. Uh... walk it off, champ?

Everything was perfect, the way he fell, the helmet falling off, and the damage sustained to the armor.

star wars right now.... just falling and falling,

Typical Storm Trooper behavior.

Down D. Stairs strikes again

The music continuing after the pause is absolutely brilliant lmao

Lol

Some stormtroopers have bad aim this one has bad legs!

Some jedi in the back after using the force to knick this storm trooper down

I just can&#39;t stop laughing

Is he ok?

Oh god, the walk of shame at the end….

i feel so bad for this dude hope he did not get too fked up

Best thing Star Wars has done in a long time

We had no idea what the was a bad omen for

Bro sumed up star war pretty well

The steps insulted him”with you every step of the way”

Lol

Star wars animators furiously taking notes for future reference

the npcs spamming ‘you alright’ tho

The step he tripped on had the quote “with you every step of the way” written on it. It wasn’t wrong I suppose.

&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;

“Hold X to revive”

Stormtroopers always miss. Only this time he didn&#39;t miss a shot, he missed a step.

Jesus says, &quot;I am the way, the truth and the life. No man comes to the Father but through me.&quot; Turn to Him today.

I would’ve put the helmet back on too, from sheer embarrassment 😭😭

Average Southern Cross experience

I fucked up guys

Bro&#39;s walking away to find a corner to cry in. Been there after a fall like that

It was on purpose, he wanted his armor to look battle worn.

Star Dork. Limping to a theater near you.

Looks like Biden getting off of Air Force One🤣
😂😂

classic

Pretty good representation of the Star Wars franchise actually.

Good thing he had armor

I laughed so hard at this it makes me feel bad there was a guy inside there.

It makes sense the Stortroopers are not doing well because of the helmet XD
He missed a step

No aim no eye sight
I knew as soon as the Storm Trooper started to fall that he was on a roll.   😆

That has gotta hurt.

this has to be the the least funny video on youtube

He Missed a step, Classis Storm Trooper.

Order 65

The plastic sound im DYING LMAOOat least not many people saw.. a-a-and hes a stormtrooper so hes anonymous..

Men down &quot;toward the stairs&quot;

What the h is with these stairs. A message on every step??CONFORMOBEYWE WILL WATCH YOUFfs

Can someone add lasers and explosions to this haha but I&#39;m sure that hurt that fall was no joke even tho it&#39;s kinda funny

Good thing you had that armour on sir

My life summed up in one video ! Just keep pushing! (:

That&#39;s what this Virgin deserves

That is a methaphor if I&#39;ve seen any

looks like he did it on purpose

looks like he did a stunt because laterally jumped forward and rolled

wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He’s probably the same stormtrooper who hit his head in A New Hope

good thing he was wearing armor 😂😂😂

The Sequel trilogy in a nuttshell

he missed a step

omg the fast forward killed me

Stormtroopers even miss the stairs

<a href="">0:05</a> the legendary moment

K.O

The music picking right back up as he limps away absolutely killed me

lmfao fugg star wars
I knew that armor was useless 😂

Probably the only instance of a stormtrooper&#39;s armour being responsible for both risking their wearer&#39;s life and possibly saving it at the same time.

This is MY joker

At least he had the costume for protection

Palapatine: The entire Legion of the best troops.&quot;Stormtrooper arriving in Endor&quot;

This represents what watching the new trilogy felt like

When you fall out of character literally.

Force push

Why did he lay there as if he died 😂

&quot;With you every step of the way.&quot;

THE armor protected him

Shout out to Southern Cross station in my hometown of Melbourne!

I don&#39;t know why this came to my feed but this is just clout.

Disney since 2019

He lost the high ground :(

&quot;This armor&#39;s useless!&quot;

That is why they never had to change from clones

No way the armor actually protected him 😭

ironically the armor worked better than in the movies

The amount of tears and laughter this created has convinced me I’m going to hell

Acting like a actual stormtrooper! 🤣😂
<a href="">0:00</a> - <a href="">0:04</a> Rogue One<a href="">0:04</a> - <a href="">0:06</a> The Force Awakens<a href="">0:07</a> - <a href="">0:08</a> The Last Jedi <a href="">0:09</a> - <a href="">0:11</a> The Rise Of Skywalker

the way his helmet bounces off him

Lol that&#39;s SO embarrassing!! Haha what a total loser! An absolute twat, that one!! 😂😂

lol that sound of him falling down

I’m sure it didn’t help to improve his aim.

clealry a staged fall you dont keep rolling like that he would have stopped and clunged way before that

Real life family guy moment

HAHAHAH REKT

Bro has a mission to complete

His armor is made of The Empire&#39;s finest plastic, Vader spared no expense!

People underestimate how much armor can protect you. If he weren’t wearing it he’d probably be quite a bit more bruised up.

I dropped my Stormtrooper helmet down some stairs once and the black film around the bottom split and the jaw flew off. Get me this man&#39;s armorsmith!

“With every step of the way”💀

This wasn’t a coincidence, the force tripped him.

Storm Trooper Armor rating: -50 Agility and -50 Luck but +25 Strength and +25 Endurance

He&#39;s gonna be using handrails next time, I assume
Man thought that was Joe Biden for a sec

Fun fact! This video is fake. It was created by the Woolshed Company in Melbourne. Now that you&#39;re looking for it, at the start of the video the stormtrooper seems kind of off.

this is a stunt man lol

Should&#39;ve added in the Wilhelm scream.... 🙃

Didn&#39;t know Joe Biden ever put on a storm trooper costume.

Adequately trained storm trooper right here.

They shoot poorly and also walk poorly.  They don&#39;t stand a chance.

How it feels to chew 5 gum.

This was better than the actual movie😂

Lore accurate Stormtrooper

Hope he wasn&#39;t going to watch the sequels... 😢

Yep, they are here to cause destruction!💯

There would have been no shame in using the railing

What else can you expect from a group of soldiers who cant even shoot straight😂😂

And, as usual, the armor was ineffective as protection.

Foreshadowing.

Shockmaster vibes
Are you surprised? Stormtrooper healthcare package doesn&#39;t cover eye exams..

This has been happening to Star Wars ever since that premiere.

good thing he was wearing his armour.

Staged

Staged and fake. Gtfo you horrible person of badness.

He got up and walked away that’s s real trooper.

Of course, a stormtrooper has to even miss the step.

Bro pressed the R to Ragdoll button accidently 💀

someone behind him in the shadows: <b>force push</b>

Absolute Trooper.

can you fall up stairs? YOU FKING RTARDS!

&quot;I find your lack of faith...disturbing.&quot;

😂😂😂wow

As Ted would say, “I fell out of my suit when I hit the floor”

Stormtroopers always miss. They even miss the step.

I&#39;m fairly certain the armor is actually plastic, or at least supposed to be some form of plastic, considering the fact in the movies it looks like plastic and it&#39;s as useless as plastic, armor wise anyways

Increased his accuracy by managing to hit each step on the way down.

I actually thought he lost his head

More entertaining than the movie haha

this but a scratch

Using the force of gravity, Luke?

That hurt to watch

Sometimes foreshadowing is relatively obvious

He forgot to scream in his fall 🤪 !

It must be really hot in that stormtrooper suit.

at least he had all that armor to protect him lol

Was well protected... 🤣

I visited these exact stairs today. They are the southern cross station stairs at spencer street. I could see him falling down the stairs with my imagination. That shi is no joke lmao.

First time storm trooper armour has been effective

May the farce be with you.

Because he appears to be ok.. this is funny as hell! Hahahahahaah... the storm trooper suit probably saved his ass.

“I can’t see a thing in this helmet.”

idiot can&#39;t even go down some stairs

Such Balaam.
It looks like it was pretty cold from what people are wearing, so he had plenty of padding covered by plastic &quot;armor&quot; which would have actually made it effective. Probably why he didn&#39;t seem to be injured.

Tuberville trying on this years’ costume.

aren&#39;t you alittle short to be a storm trooper? 😂🤣

”With you every step of the way.”

can&#39;t believe how in character this still feels... really want to see this with a sound effect from the movies lol jokes aside hope you&#39;re ok

Thankfully he had a helmet

I love how he made an almost identical Obi Wan Lego Star Wars death sound at <a href="">0:11</a>

the only time in history of the galaxy where storm trooper armor actually prevented an injury.

You’re laughing. He’s falling down stairs and you’re laughing.😂😂😂😂

This Stormtrooper needs a haircut.Problem solved

I&#39;ve watched this like 10 times and it keeps getting better.

Average day at Southern Cross Station

Looked WAY to clean falling down dem steps lol

That was a pretty bad ass fall.

This proves that stormtroopers doesn’t just miss their shots, but also missing their steps.

Someone should&#39;ve warned that Stormtrooper to beware the stairs of Southern Cross.

For the Empire!

Hitting the door was not so bad, actually.

More entertaining than the all the films

Armor protected him

I knew that Stormtroopers had bad aim, but by the Force!

“I can’t see a thing in this helmet”

southern cross

Thats gotta hurt.
He was so committed to his role, he missed a step and fell down to the bottom.Now THAT&#39;S professionalism. He should get a raise!

Get rect 🤣🤣
Hahahahaha!!!🤣🤣🤣
Biden in storm trooper costume!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biden in a storm trooper costume!🤣🤣🤣
Biden dressed as storm trooper…😂🤣😁
<a href="">0:05</a> it makes me funny

If that stopped him from making it to the screening of &#39;The Last Jedi&#39; or &#39;Rise of Skywalker&#39;, he can consider that a blessing.

The fact that the stairs said &quot;With you every step of the way&quot; makes this even more funny.

“With you every step of the way”

That stormtropper just hitted me off

Woah, that is a crumbling

Well, the armor is good for something!

The crumbling sound of every nut bolt 🔩 was marvellous.

At least your suit broke your fall lol

12M views, 376k likes ... wow ... ive got to film this for my channel!

I feel bad for laughing 🤭please God forgive me

This is basically a representation of the current state of Star Wars.

are they really with us every step of the way?

the empire really did strike back

That&#39;s the most durable stormtrooper i&#39;ve ever seen.

This is what Joe Biden envisions on a daily basis

Ouch😮
he could&#39;nt see a thing in this helmet

Move accurate! ✨ 😊 ✨
When you forgot your personal Jet Pack!

More like a Stairtripper than a Stormtrooper 😱

They do stairs better than they shoot....

the force was not with bro

the force was not with him

I was ok uh huh lets see it, OMFG IS HE ALLRIGHT, lololololololol

Someone must have force pushed him for him to eat shit like that

<a href="">0:06</a> I love how not only his helmet flies off his body but it stayed in the air long enough for him to do a spin and hit it with his elbow making it fly even further

I&#39;m actually kind of confused if this is real or not because that fall looked pretty brutal even in all that plastic.

I know it sounds cottonwool but people aren&#39;t afraid enough of stairs, without the armour and padding a fall like this can cause horrific injuries and sometimes kills people. Known of a couple of cases of people dying on stair falls, and one of my customers needed hospitalising after a fall on stairs. It&#39;s basically like being hit really hard multiple times with a metal bar.

Top tier armor right there

<b>STAIR WARS</b>

I thought it was a transition lol

&quot;How do they see in these things?&quot;

Why did he just ragdoll for no reason? Lol

Am I Meant To Be Laughing At This? 😂

The force 😂

ayo the pizza here

The Omori fandom has entered the chat

Ooooooooops

Good thing he was wearing armor to prevent any injury.

How does he get back up after that😂bro is a real soldier

This the First time a stormtroopers armor saved a stormtroopers life. 😂

I like how the armor probably helped prevent the sharp impacts on the way down

I actually feel mega bad for this guy.

Yep thats a stormtrooper alright.

His Stormtrooper spacial awareness game is on point. That&#39;s a committed character actor.

I&#39;m hoping that armor had SOME padding to it, it would have taken the worst of the fall.That looked painful though. Hope he&#39;s okay.

Stormtroopers are notorious for being bad at aiming. But whilst it was unintentional, that joke hit hard.

NERDS !!!!

Ians Chat: that vid was us by meme in tank fish new update doors

those trash helmets the emperor made standard is what tripped him!

Probably the fakest fake tripping I ever saw.

I’m literally dying of this <a href="">0:05</a>

This one clip was better than the Disney sequels.

This is the meme that i did not expect it to be funny 💀💀💀

I kind of hope all of that plastic actually helped protect him

Star wars the fall awakens

First time I&#39;ve ever seen a Stormtrooper hit anything.

Woops and ouch

That happened to me after trick or treating as Darth Vader.

<a href="">0:05</a> <b>Wilhelm scream plays</b>
Someone use the force to make him fall

What’s even funnier is he looks like Solid Snake and walks away in shame. Poor guy hope his pride not too wounded, he made a lot of us laugh.

I’m dying at how his helmet and chest piece fell off 😂. Is this staged or legit?

He&#39;s been watching too many videos of Biden.  But  you&#39;re not supposed to fall down the stairs, you&#39;re supposed to fall up!!

The empire strikes back

Luke!  I detect a disturbance in the Force.

I love how the music cuts off then restarted right when he got to his feet.

😂

Now that&#39;s a winner in all senses of the word.

That’s gonna hurt

Stormtroopers does indeed miss everything even the stairs with their feet.

Stormtrooper: Why Did I Have To Wear This Armor It&#39;s Literally Useless Others Got Shot And The Armor Didn&#39;t Protect Them

FEEL THE POWER OF DOWN D. STAIRS!

Like a champ!!💯

🤣He should&#39;ve used The Force!

&quot;The fall&quot; has become his life, his identifier among those of his peer group and something he must laugh about ruefully or be deemed a poor sport, even after 8 goddamn years. The bitterness mounts, the structure of his life thrown into disrepair due to this one damnable event.

I came here to laugh but I literally gaspedThat must’ve hurt

bro i tripped while taking out the trash in june and i broke my leg bad and i&#39;m gonna be able to walk again in 2 days. but this guy does this and just gets up

The railings are there for a reason.

Ouch……that’s gonna leave a mark. 😊

He missed a few steps

IT WAS NOT ANIMATED THE WHOLE TIME?!?!?

Bro be tripin XD😂😂😂😂

Thank god he’s ok

Its not the fall that hurt ...its the sudden stops over and over and over......

That&#39;s Melbourne, Southern Cross station! You can even hear &quot;you alright, mate?&quot;

FOR THE EMPIRE!!!

That’s some stuntman energy right there.

Damn this is hilarious! Of course l hope the stalwart Empire soldier only suffered minor contusions.

If he had been carrying his blaster the sights might have been knocked into alignment.

Surprised that he even misses the steps?

they walk as well as they shoot I see.

Awesome stunt work there, bro. Absolutely awesome! 🤟

May the gravitational force be with him.

Yup...it was the same guy<a href="">

Hindouche

Always keep your helmet on when falling down a flight of steps.

A strom trooper losing his helmet is instant dismissal from the Empire.  He left to join the Resistance.

Oh my……he may never be able to have children now…..wait…..never mind.  Not an issue. 😂

My older sister after piano and violin recital

Finding out this video is not real but just a video made by a company for publicity be like:

Disney Star Wars summarized.

Disney Star Wars in a nutshell except he is still falling

What a looser hahahah

😂😂😂😂

I think this is script and not script for 1 his head did not hit a single step so he most be a stuntman 2 i think he was going to fall on purpose but misplaced a atep and fell but went along with what happened

Sums up the whole franchise.

man those storm troopers always trippin

omg. i need that. Ty.

Fake.

Oh I’m hurt oh
He missed that step harder than he misses rebels

May the force of gravity be with you.

At least he had armor to protect him.

Damn Ewok snipers

That&#39;s what happens when you grow your bangs too long and they get in the way of your vision...  get a haircut 😂

Wow! what an incredibly average stunt

So, he… he missed a step

It’s such a perfect fall, mesmerising wow

At least he&#39;s good enough in aiming 😂😂😂

Stormtrooper walking is not so far from his shooting😂😂😂

Good thing he was in uniform!

Ngl this had me on the floor

such a dude thing to not hold the handrail.

i am ashamed at how hard  I Iaughed

The force was not with him

Poor guy,thats not funny

Fucking nerd😂😂😂😂😂😂
How feel you?

The armor and the helmet protected him.

I sense a disturbance in the farce....

That was funny, how he disassembled himself.

Someone should add vfx of a blaster hitting him before he falls

When you walk down some steep stairs with ski boots you could fall like that.

I felt a &#39;slight&#39; disturbance in the force...

Ed 209 didn&#39;t do any better either.

These aren&#39;t the droids you&#39;re looking for 👍🤣😂

why would you fast forward through the fall… garbage content. 0/10 and downvoted…

Good stuntman
So that&#39;s what a Stormtrooper would sound like if he was crushed in the trash compactor lol

It would have been better to play the imperial march when he got up😅

I fell down my basement stairs just like this.  Halfway down, I forgot how to walk and I went knnes first all the way down.  Broke 2 toes and bruised knees. 😂

I laughed so hard

This is how I felt while watching The Last Jedi.

&quot;I can&#39;t see a thing in this helmet!&quot;

Storm Trooper missed the step like he missed his target.

Are you stomtrooper

There&#39;s guide rails on the stairs but of course Stormtroopers are not accustomed to such things, OH&amp;S is for weakling Rebel scum.

I would&#39;ve loved to have seen this in a Star Wars blooper reel!

premiere of what? observably not a popular premiere

Oh God it’s like the ShockMaster all over again (just look up ShockMaster debut and you’ll see what I’m talking about)

Why did i hear nothing but bowling pins as he fell down the stairs?

yikes! high quality costumes like that are around a thousand bucks now

That’s what you get for taking the gay stairs.

It’s only funny cause he’s in a storm trooper outfit 😂

Storm Bloopers.

Off camera- darth vader hated latecomers, he moved his hand and it caused the tumble.

I was just at that stairway at Southern Cross last month and remembered this video.

stormtrooper can&#39;t even hit a stair...

WOW that was FUNNY!!!!!!!!!

Remember, COMPNOR kiddies: THIS is why we wear armor! Plastic armor.

Priceless!!!

I hate it when that happens.

Faaaaaaaaake

Went all nine yards for a realistic depiction of a Star Trooper (1977-1983 style).

poor guy! that looks painful

just like the sequel trilogy

Not an Ultramarine...

He is a professional stuntman. Don’t try this at home,kids.

That&#39;s what happens when woke Disney takes over

I hope he&#39;s ok.

Well his day is ruined

Vader won&#39;t tolerate this.

Ouch! I think his &quot;armor&quot; did provide some protection.

“Lord Vader, I was wondering if I could get your autogra— Son of a bitch!! Sh!t!! Fu— ahh!! Gawd damnit!!! Oooouch!!! That’s gonna leave a mark!!!uuuuhhhh **moaning sounds**.”

I’m not ashamed to hold the railing.

Fake.. but i appreciate it anyways.

Metaphor for the entire franchise

He ‘fell’ on porpoise.

Fake

Good job he was wearing that amour.

Need the Eastenders ending music here

I hope he is okay. But that was funny, sorry

This is basically ‘The Last Jedi’ in a nutshell

Stormtripper

When she says &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little short for a Stormtrooper?&quot;

Who else watched many times? 😂😂😂

I got secondhand embarrassment from that 😳

Ummm.... Now he still, OK???

I think this trooper imbibed at the cantina ....

He walks better than he shoots. It’s a joke folks - actually, there is a good theory about how the Stormtroopers were told to miss the main characters on purpose because Luke and Leia were so important to the Empire. There are plenty of examples of Stormtroopers actually hitting things, so it kinda makes sense. A different take on that is Vader used the Force to deflect all those shots, but that seems a bit of a stretch to me.

at least he wore protection :D

<a href="">0:05</a>

Terrible acting.

Stair Wars

Trooper Brandon at your service!!

the force is incredible

Play this entire video @ 0.25x is fucking hilarious even more

What makes it even better is that steps actually say: &quot;We&#39;re with you every step of the way.&quot;

It is better to fall down the stairs than to let the empire fall

Stair Tripper.
The force is weak with this one (KIdding aside; I hope he wasn&#39;t hurt.)

Good stunt!  The camera was in the exact correct position to catch the entire thing, keeping you completely in-frame for the entire stunt.  Good thing they weren&#39;t surprised and missed part of it.  It&#39;s almost like they knew exactly where to stand to film the whole thing correctly.  Very nice!  It was also incredibly fortunate he had all that padding under his armor.

<a href="">0:05</a> he didn’t trip, he just switched to Ragdoll mode

You cannot over estimate how humiliating that was.

LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! retard grow the fck up!!!

Me when I&#39;m scared to perform in front of kid and then I tried to purposely trip myself so I could don&#39;t want to perform.

All I hear is yoda saying “how embarrassing”

He&#39;s now seen the light and will no doubt join Luke and the Galatic Federation of Free Alliances  🌟🙏🌟

😂😂

The empire&#39;s finest

I wouldn&#39;t want to sit in the seat of a movie theater for 2 hours wearing that.

The movie was a flop too.

“Can’t see anything with this helmet on!”

Taking &quot;head clanker&quot; to the next level 👍

did he die?
At least that armor is hard enough to protect him.

How is there not a wilhelm scream?

The FORCE was NOT with him.

Makes me wanna grease up a tarped hill with Sunlight and fire on one of the suits.  You get less scratches that way.

that explains everything :D
Bro it sounded like a toy falling and being dismembered XD

<a href="">0:00</a> - Me When TESB (The Empire Strikes Back)<a href="">0:05</a> - Me When RoTS (Revenge of The Sith)

Not surprising..... as this is the same stormtrooper who almost decapitates himself on the Death Star blaster door in A New Hope.

can somebody add the wilhelm scream, please.

This footage would be perfect for a YTP. Just reverse him going down the stairs. 💀

Luke was right about the helmets.

Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes.

Its okay. We didnt see that.

Must of been wearing a &quot;Made in USA&quot; suit.

I fall a lot. I need to finally give in and get some of that armor. 😂

The last slide...😂😂😂😂😂😂

he had armor he’s fine

FAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE

I fell like that once but it was a little different. I was going up when i fell and i slid down the stairs. Broke the pinky toe.

DORK

The part where he fells off is better than the stormtroopers aim

I saw the whole thing, a Jedi force tripped him!

:looks at stairs: &quot;Traitor!&quot;
That black woman at the end looking at him like, &quot;White Stormtroopers, ... never would happen to a Black one&quot;.  LOL

Weeeeeee🎉😂
Star wars: The stairs strikes back😂

Those stormtroopers were pretty vulnerable, as I recall.  One little tap from Luke&#39;s laser and they dropped.

Use the handrail noob

he missed the step

Maybe he was blasted

The armor couldn&#39;t even take stairs.

Obviously the Force is not with him.

When nerds think they&#39;re cool and an unforeseeable force reminds them of how cringe they truly are.

I hope he was ok besides his pride - I felt so sorry for him - broke some of outfit but, as long as he ok - I mean sure he walked / hobbled it off but, Im sure that had some aches an bruises as well shaking you up inside. Gutted.

well, he hit more steps then enemies!

(1) men do not wear long gear that’s for women(2) do not worship any other false gods before meBreak our FATHER’S commandments and you get what you rightfully deserve.

He even made the lego death noise at the end lmao.

Every few years I gotta give this a go.

stormtrooper misses the stairs

I think thats the first time ever this suit protected a trooper from an injury :O

Yep, those helmets are an absolute nightmare when it comes to seeing anything not directly in front of you.

I love the sight of stormtroopers falling.

Can someone locate the stairs in Google search

Playing characters as an adult is more humiliating than falling down the stairs. Sad people pretending are funny.

Man became a lego.

Is anyone surprised he missed the step though?

Unsolicited free fall

Alice in Wonderland, in Ohio
Is he okay?

Giving Darth Vader some entertainment. 😂
Sooo, they can&#39;t hit anything AND they can&#39;t walk down stairs.

That&#39;s what happens to grown ass men who dress in costumes.

The way he slides across the pavement when he hits the bottom 😂

He is no way a real storm trooper ... Not one trooper in the history of star wars ever got back up...

Don&#39;t know how Han Solo made the shot but damn Han can shoot them from anywhere.

bros near southern cross station and spencer street outlet😭

Did he die?
Storm Tripper.

this is basically a metaphor for the Film Industry as of August 6, 2023

That suit looked like it helped 😅

YOU HAVE FAILED ME FOR THE LAST TIME!

On the bright side he had armor on

It&#39;s a metaphor for the sequel trilogy.

What a trooper.

That&#39;s generally how it goes for the dark side

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Wow, a Trooper with functional armor.

Heart warming to say the least.

Brought to you by AGL…With you every step of the way!

Poor guy
This is funny as hell can i use it for my videos

Go on don&#39;t break character
The Empire Stairs Back

Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise...falling down the stairs

This was his first accident. <a href="">

Honestly, that pretty much sums up the disney Star Wars movies.

Hahaha oh shit
bruh the music edit 😂

Apart from never shooting straight, they are bad on stairs

HIS ARMOR BROKE!!!!!

I hope he had a nice TRIP See what I did there 🤣🤣🤣

:P

Use the rails!! Don&#39;t rely on The Force.I hope he&#39;s okay.

He did not find the stair he was looking for

Not only are they bad it&#39;s shooting blasters but they have a hard time walking down a flight of stairs😅 how did the empire ever get so far? They must be no stairs in space

Stair Wars

Poor guy. Hilarious.

Lol that&#39;s hilarious

Can&#39;t hit a wombat from 2 meters. Bonk heads on pneumatic doors. Can&#39;t see. But can fall down stairs, no prob. Must have had a stim pac.

Where was triumph the insult dog? <a href="">

When I’m feeling down , I watch him falling down. Makes me fu**ing laugh every times!!

😂

Can someone add a Lazer blast plz

Sounded like a bag of legos

Could have been me -_-

THIS IS WHY THE EMPIRE LOST... Stairs and are guys can&#39;t shoot really. That too.

This is why you join the Jedi instead.

So... Stair Wars then. A New Slope.The Incline Flights Back.  Return of the Steps, Aye.  The Phantom Railing. Attack on the Bones.  The Hold Wars. Revenge of the Slip.

<a href="">0:27</a> Love how the guy at the end is like “…… so we gonna ignore someone falling down the stairs???????”

the force is not with him

shame baby..damn
Walking after that, what a “trooper”

&quot;With you every step of the way&quot;Said the stairs.

At least the armor help a little bit it sure doesnt work against blasters

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

This perfectly shows the state of the Star Wars franchise right now

Good thing he had all that armour on

is this real?

Bruh I feel so bad for him how much would that armor cost and he was just going to see a star wars premier

Wrong time with Right Armour

The one stormtrooper to actually hit anything repeatedly…

like a true storm trooper, he shrugs it off and puts his helmet back on

Still funny to this day.

All on purpose

That was a warning for what was to come

Oh man that was a yard sale

i want to fall down the stairs in a ninja outfit.

OMG, I would have died from embarrassment. This dedicated Trooper jumped back into action and threw in a hair flip.🤣🤣🤣🤣

he lost 40% of his iron armor while falling down the stairs

The way he just ragdolled kills me 😂

it&#39;s like the stars war

damn
Reminds me of shockmaster

Ah that&#39;s alright stormtroopers were expendable

Yet his aim never got better

This will never not Bring Me Joy,He May have Fallen but He only Lifted Our Moods. 😂 Such a Storm Trooper is Worth more than All the Credits in the Galaxy! ✨

I think the music makes it funny.. but glad he&#39;s ok.   Them stairs will kill ya!

A little clumsy to be a stormtrooper?

Just another day of being a stormtrooper

That armor saved his ass

Storm Troopers are always missing what they aim for. This one missed the step.

Darth Vader: You&#39;ve failed me for the last time

little did we know, this was an omen of how star wars would do over the next decade

im doing my part eughufluckemghuoofahoof
Embarrassment  made him move like adrenaline  ...

Pretty good Biden impression......I give it a +........☺

Can’t recover from that

good thing I had a helmet

dishonorably discharged from the 5O1st

dude fell on the with you every step of the way step

Him shameful once in a lifetime were immortalized on meme curse

Staged

Everyone: How is he still moving? What motivate one after such a truma?The stromtrooper: for glory of the Sith emperor.Everyone: Of course, silly question.

This is the way...down.

Bro think he joe biden

Just like the simulations

From a safe distance, he looks like Boba too.

Jokes aside, that armor likely saved him from bruises and potential brain damage.

this man did it before John Wick

The music restarting after…I’m dying 😂

&quot;I&#39;m in so much pain! The armor does nothing!&quot;

Haha

The one day that armor was actually useful.

That probably sucked but felt kind of cool

A true Hero of the empire

Of course he missed the stairs he&#39;s a storm trooper!

Memes aside, the armor and helmet likely saved him from bruises and a concussion.

Yeah this lines up with stormtrooper aim. Fairly certain the Empire recruits is soldiers from the galaxy&#39;s many cantinas. 😂😂

Before watching this it had never occurred to me just how embarrassing it would be to actually fall down some stairs. You’ve kind of got to be a real goober.

Speedrunning disney SW any%

Stormtrooper: I am power!Gravity: Remains undefeated.

Good thing he had that stormtrooper armor.  Without it we would have gotten really messed up.  Although a bit of a fail, he came out of it pretty good

Even his feet miss the floor

Well the movie sucked and he fell down the stairs this guy is most embarrassing person this world has ever seen may he drink piss.

This justifies why stormtroopers can&#39;t shoot straight and them not secretly being on the good side

Bro has never been more grateful for armour

wilhelm scream.wav
Am i going to hell for laughing at this??

Clearly on purpose

I can’t believe you’ve done this.

Ouch he&#39;s lucky he didn&#39;t break a bone

Ever since Disney required SW:

The Force Awakens came out 7 years ago?

Star Wars morons.
The way the music picks back up 💀💀

I guess he missed a step.

Bruh said “nah imma do my own thing”

That would actually hurt so much with that gear

This reminds me of how, even though we often think we&#39;re walking a straight path that will take us where want to go, we often stumble and fall back down  onto the wrong path.We just need to remember that the right path is the narrow one, the gate of Jesus who leads to heaven, and not to walk the wide and easy path of sin which leads to death. ❤If you haven&#39;t heard the gospel before, here it is:We have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God, which sadly means we&#39;re deserving of hell. However, God in His perfect love and mercy made a way for us to get to heaven without compromising His perfect justice. He sent His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to go into the world in the flesh as fully God and fully man, to live the perfect sinless life that we could not, and to take the punishment for our sins upon Himself by dying on the cross before rising again three days later to defeat death! Now, you can have a place in heaven simply by accepting Jesus as your LORD and saviour and He will clothe you in His righteousness and ask the Father to give you the Holy Spirit who will guide you on the narrow road to heaven where you will get to be with the Father face-to-face and all suffering will cease! Hallelujah amen 🙏✝️⛪🙌💖♥️❤

A perfect metaphor for everything that has happened since Return of the Jedi.

dont worry! his virginity was unharmed during the fall

I feel bad for the cosplayer, but if he were a real stormtrooper, I&#39;d be laughing my ass off.

They are even worse to see in IRL

None of these little kids realize that this is clearly a fake fall but it&#39;s still funny to watch

😂😂😂😂

Does this belong in the canon?
weee, that was fun!

I love how the camera still manages to follow him perfectly during his tumble.

(Insert amazing piano playing while stormtrooper fell down flight of stairs)

At least he had protection?

This is the equivalent of their weapon accuracy.

OOOHHH SO THATS WHAT THE ARMOUR IS FOR

Stormtrooper fokin miss the step 💀

The first time Stormtrooper armor protected its wearer.

That’s a real chad right there.

Good thing he had all that armor on. He could’ve broken a bone

Oof

I am only human after all

Hope hes okay and I feel bad because of his cosplay they can cost up to 2000 and take ALOT of time to make. I hope it wasn&#39;t damaged.

He’s now a Stormtriper.😂

Anyone feel kinda bad for him? I mean his armor was absolitely destroyed with pieces flying off everywhere and also has to bear the shame of falling down the stairs

he used force heal on him xD

im telling you the white armour is cursed

Tiny broken pieces everywhere… that suit is done lol

Bro bame a ragdoll
This is probably the same one who hit his head on the door 😂

I hope he’s okay lol. Even though the armor protected him.

rookie mistake lol
Star Wars: The Stairs Strikes Again

This is why stormtroopers miss all there shots

Stormtripper.

Stormtroopers going down the steps in the death star be like:

This lives in my head rent-free.

The Disney sequel trilogy in a nutshell

Pov: You use force push on a Stormtrooper in Jedi Fallen Order
😭😭 the noise it made😭😭
Ah we finally found the use for their armor! Falling accidents!

he fell down like a ragdoll 💀

This is pure pain and I want to give him money and a hug for his suffering.  I could see that happening to me if I was walking down those stairs.  He did good though, he did good.  Good work ethic to walk it off.  I would pay him to play a clone trooper in a live-action, maybe a storm trooper if it is where his interests lie more then clone troopers.  But the clone troopers are so cool too.

Yea that must have hurt, Jeffrey said he felt that one for weeks.

&quot;Remember son, dying is gay&quot;-william afton 1990

honestly, if there was any &quot;safe and proper&quot; way to fall down a flight of stairs, this would be it: remember ladies and gents, with any bad fall &quot;tuck and roll&quot;

That is why there were only elevators in the Death Star

Its just a custome, its not real

Guess you can say his trip was short.

Good thing he was literally covered in armor
