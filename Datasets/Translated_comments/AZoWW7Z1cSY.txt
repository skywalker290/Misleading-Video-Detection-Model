waiting for movie

Ye movie Theater me lavo yaaaaaar

Lovely people lovely shooting lovely song lovely lyrics

Saawan me lag gayi has some pretty sexist lyrics (as showcased by most songs sung by Badshah and Mika)



Some lines, and I quote, are:



&quot;Bring me some firecrackers!
Bomb ends in mai
Nazreen cursed me
Dil pe daalu dakaa mai
Sau aagey do sau peeche
Chup chup ke photo kheeche

Social media pe charche bade hai

Bachhe kya boodhe bhi mere peeche pade hai&quot; 



CAN WE PLEASE PLEASE ADDRESS SEXIST BOLLYWOOD LYRICS? 

And can somebody PLEASE tell that garbed under TACKY beats and CATCHY hook lines, IT IS STILL NOT OKAY TO WRITE SUCH LYRICS!!!

Every other song has the boy going behind a girl and describing her in a, forget stereotypical, but in a derogatory, objectifying way and WE STILL GODDAMN DANCE TO THESE SONGS IN CLUBS, SANGEETS AND WHAT NOT. 



Please let&#39;s not normalize this. I wonder how actors agree to do (dance to/ lipsync/ be a part of) these songs. Are they bound by some contract or can they not see the sexism or are they hypocrites?

Movie aagyi bhai

Nice video... <a href=""> SAAWAN MAI LAG GAYI AAG - DANCE COVER, DO LEAVE A &quot;COMMENT &quot;

Bhai 2 films main same remake song kun??? Bhai bohot sare acche original songs hai unka remake bana lete! kun ke aap ke paas saare creativity Khatam hogaye tu Bollywood mai survive karne ke lea loud music aur bekar rape daal ke original songs ko kharab karna compulsory hai!! 

Who all will like this song here
Babblu bhaiya what are you doing?
