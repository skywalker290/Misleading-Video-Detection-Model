CISF is a government uniform, that's why it is silent, if SiS had been there then these celebrities would have quarreled, especially young people.
Mazaaaa agyaaaaa yaaaaar

There is still talk of Salman bhai.
No one is paying attention to this, why do I know that celebrities are being asked for ID? If any celebrity is entering the airport, they are keeping a lot of logs by packing cameras. Obviously, there is a security issue. I am a star because I don't need any ID...we are like idiots...
I proud my army

It is the misfortune of the country to give up these naked people.
Who said that there are heroes in Bollywood, these are the business people whom people have put on their heads, buy cut Bollywood, in this world, if you really love your parents then stay away from Bollywood.

Why are Salman Khan's car windows tinted? Is it illegal to tint?

There is no wrong in this. Security is doing its work


instead of covering the officers who did there duty honestly ....the media is covering bollywood stars....bullshit.... and hatts off to the officers who stand equal with every person...next time cover the officer&#39;s who real stars n not the reel stars

What did you do and how to see the ID?
RIP thumbnail 
Friend, I don't understand that such a record is being made about any celebrity, is he not a human being, is he not an Indian citizen, he will not have any Indian ID, if Salman Khan is getting his ID checked by a government civil officers. What mistake are you making or who made this video? Did you get it from someone?
Sick media....

What so special in this ..If we take a low class people categories in india ..These dirty politicians (someone) and dirty bollywood people(who expose body to earn money) will be on top of that list ..But unfortunately our people are giving preference to them

Really appreciate, the work of security officers. But other hand,. Those people who barking Sir,, sir,, mam, mam, I feel deep sympathy to all of them. I think think, this is not only a way to make ends meet. They have to follow some self-respect, but they are dying, saying,,, Please please, Sir, sir, sir, madam, mam mam. And those celebraties even not looking at them.

inn celebs ki koi okaat nhi h inn Army pesonals k saamne .Cisf personal are doing a very good job

50% problems to ese ho solve ho jayegi agar hum log in nachne wale logo ko seer pe na betha ye

Why do indian news have to make it so dramatic ...like shaking of the videos or extra extra replays or the music like dum tanatanata like wtf...and indian animation sucks like the worst and some other countries too but almost all 95% of indian animation sucks and bollywood is no more interesting we no longer wait in excitement for new movies now ...cause it&#39;s all just the same a guy and a girl falls in love and this that ...ugh

The superstar celebrities of our country are farmers and soldiers, the bad people of Bollywood are stars in name only, they are of no use, only the superstar in Bollywood industry is Sonu Sood, although he plays the role of a goon in the film, but in reality he is a hero, the rest are the bad guys in Bollywood. The people neither believe in God nor the Indian law, and even the Indian law cannot uproot them, the law is so weak, the law is equal for all, motherfuckers, hero heroine people.

Why have you kept these people so high, man? Once a film was being shot on Yamuna Expressway, Katrina Kaif and Farhan Akhtar were there, I too was sitting in my car smoking beedi. They were shooting a scene in the car very close to me, but I did not even move from my place. No, I kept tasting beedi and did not take any photos.
Thanks very much

Good

All these are Bollywood dancers, no one is an idealist of our country, they should be treated the same as a common man.

All celebs should be treated normally like other people

Make news about celebrities and make them viral on social media.
Our real hero is our army and security personnel

Vai a log vagwan hain kiya... oo bhi aam admi hain. , So asking for ID from them is such a low thing...our constitution has not given much rights to anyone. ..all Indians are the same... people only want TRP....
Whoever drove the army broke the vertical square
Oh gosh ! So much of hype just when the actors walk from their car to front gate , the actors feel as though they are walking red carpet. Cut the crap guys!

These rogues need to be put in additional level of check prior to airport entry and even the flight

No one has seen his ID
Why did I give respect to Sallu? The soldier along with me also took a selfie, so I started walking.
Well.done

These guys have never broken any rules. These videos are made only to get likes, views etc. but more than half of them start giving knowledge.
Boy cott Bolly wood

Watching this was the happiest moment of our life. Great work security guards. Keep it up.We support yu.

Even from a politician?
How come these people run like dogs chasing people with cameras, I have not come into the society till today because they don't care what is the benefit of chasing them.
Power of Indian Army

CISF people do not know that their salary comes from taxes.
I have to make everyone a hero.

Why are you giving so much importance to these dancers and singers? What are these people? What is their contribution to the society.
These guys dance and consider themselves heroes.
It's Sara's last year, he took the poor girl.
Very good salam to our real heros

Everything pales in comparison to the power of the uniform.
CISF is doing its duty or is doing absolutely right work.
What is the matter that you are eating? Jai Hind, Jai Bharat sir.
Power uniform  I gave four sticks to Salman Marta and Sara gave four sticks to lady officer 
They are just entertainers who sing dance and act for money and fame.. They not doing any great service to be treated special in anyway, esp their kids. Donna why many nutheads worship them.

Every humanbeing are equal,so pliz treat like this , celebrities no ego..

Salman hoy ke Eno baap ....id card to dilhana padta hai..

It's absolutely true.
Who the fuck is film artists

Salute to all paramilitary forces 

The best part was sara ali khan 

BANDER BHOSADI KE MEDIA WALE 

The real hero is Salman Khan, but he is the soldier of our country, who lives on the border without fear or in the weather. Salman Khan is too much an actor. It is not equal to opening the shoes of a soldier.
Good job sir
Ticket to check krna padegi na boss

What is the evil in this or not..... What is their status in front of CISF?
Good job of on deuty officers 

Good work by CISF if the passengers comes like vip or middle class family or sports or election worker any body comes the duty of CISF is same treating to everyone not like vip or middle class isn&#39;t it good humanity by CISF jai hind

Oh no.......,.........

Highly unprofessional of cisf to let Salman khan go in without checking ID. Crpf would never let this happen.

Akshay Kumar's entire hekadi was taken out by the security guards ???
Sara to sarma gaye

Salman sir took the opportunity of retreating everyone with the soldiers of Bast H Das, give respect to him, a brilliant lady.
Soloman boi ko kiyu chor diya???

You just earn wealth, soldiers earn the country.
They are doing their work prominently unlike politicians

Salman k saath toh puri security photo uthane lagi chck nhi kiya

There is no need to give importance to these stars.

You did the right thing brother by asking for ID, you should do the same to these idiots *<b>***</b> Bollywood mein kya cha gaye load ka bal log Apne aapko sarkar samajhte Hain It is very right brother, you asked for ID.
Real hero

Salman ko to jante h, ye baki ladies kon thi? anjan logo se to ID mangenge hi

Tum sab   jha....... ho wooly

In celebrities, why do they give so much importance, these people are also human or not?
Besharmi ki hadh ho gayi ek porn star ko celebrity banake. Baithe hai  ... There&#39;s no surprise to know that bollywood so called &quot;celebrities&quot; porn films banake apna economic  status bana rahe hai! Gandi income gandi soch!!!! Besharam kuch media aise logon ke peeche bhaagte hain....

Common people who ever reading this stop praising or treating celebrities as God or some what special they are from us (common people) ignore them don&#39;t get insulted going around them for selfies and trying to talk to them...

There is no limit to the dance in front of our country's youth.
GOOD

Good sir
I salute the protector of my country.
How many times have you become a celebrity? The age of the people in the wardrobe has not increased.
Look brother, why don't you check your work and write to me as the Prime Minister. If you don't check, you don't do your duty.

It&#39;s so disappointing and disgusting that these stars don&#39;t have minimum sense that they should carry and show there I&#39;d Proof even before asked. What example are they setting

Our civil servants are real celebrities not these guys

Tollywood is grt

Wow, how crazy are the people of Vanshvaad's upaz, after receiving the people's welcome and requests, they feel as if they are very civilized and mature, but the reality is that you all know that these people are not even well educated, they are taking drugs and they are illegal. work is done differently

Great job officer, the world is being checked for normal people, what is being done to those in Bollywood? Salute to the officer who knows that even his pass is being checked.
Doing their duty with honesty... Salute u all

Good job
ALL these problems are because these film stars and people in the entertainment industry are a bigtime spoilt lot and pampered. They are all unnecessarily being paid so much money for every movie. Tell me something:- why should they be paid so much???- Are they doing any service to the country? - Are they sacrificing their lives for the country? - Are they going to the border and fighting with the enemies?- Are they Gods who fell from heaven?- When SO many people are struggling daily to earn and save money for their families, why cant even these fellows be paid like ordinary employees?Solutions:- keep a maximum monthly payment plan for ALL stars, irrespective of how big they are- a law must be passed where it is clear that in case these filmstars act smart and misbehave anywhere, don&#39;t pay income taxes etc etc etc, they shall be banned from ALL assignments for two yearsBest solution for all these problems is to ban ALL film industries in India, shut down ALL theatres and make these arrogant film stars work daily and struggle like a common man.  Then i want to see if any of these nakras and dramas will continue

Thank you PM Modi, no one is above the law! Jai Shri Ram!

Kareena kapoor Khan with taimur lang.

I would never give importance to these film actors.
This should be the difference, some run behind them to ask for autograph, some place an order and ask for ID-card.
