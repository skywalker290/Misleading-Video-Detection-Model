Dom walking in the beat gets me everytime

Please give me the name of the song from the first movie?

<a href="">0:03</a> when she says her parents aren&#39;t home

Take your time walking to the car dominick.....

If we learned 1 thing for certain, here...those streets are dusty as hell.

The cinematography throughout this sequence is epic.

I love how earlier in the movie, Dom said he was afraid to drive his dad&#39;s Charger.. he was left with no choice but to drive the car he was afraid of to avenge his buddy Jesse.

what is the name of the background music?

When Fast and Furious was about Street Racing before they ended up being GTA online 

Who here after the sexual assault allegations???

@ <a href="">1:24</a> is what I’m really here for lmao  I love that v6 growl

The way the charger roar echos at :19

Name of the somg in the begining? They had a video of it back in 2016 but they took it down. Dont remeber the name.

I don&#39;t know why they decided to just kill all the original characters and add some clowns to the crew

Whenever I walk fast I hear that techno music that plays when Dom walks to the charger 

RIP PAUL WALKER ️
Dom actually went to save Brian.

the best part of this scene is right after brian checks johnnys pulse and confirms he’s dead, and he hears torettos car, as soon as he hears it, he gets absolutely terrified. you can see it in his eyes, and confirm it in his voice. it’s great.

Is that a Supra?

&quot;Gave his mark his car keys and let him slip away... that&#39;s why he&#39;s not a cop anymore.&quot;

The music is LITERALLY Burnout 2: Point of impact, mainly when Brian clicks on the button for the nitro. Literally Burnout 2 man.

<a href="">0:04</a> Parents after finding out their kid skipped school.

Jessie Crying
Mario&#39;s Angry
Rip Paul Walker WE LOVE YOU  YOU WERE A LEGENDARY CAR ENTHUSIAST
first song name pls

toyota supra and chevelle vs  honda  crf  kawasaki klx

Rick Yune  Rick Yune my favorite actor
<a href="">0:03</a> <a href="">0:04</a> Love the way how the music is synced with Dom’s walking speed

Do Vin Diesel Or Paul Walker Talk In This Clip?

That 600 round magazine on the gun is impressive.

My expectations:Dom&#39;s crew (Dom, Letty, Jesse, Leon, &amp; Vince) with Brian vs. Johnny&#39;s crew with Lance Nguyen (melee fight) in the final battle but it never happened.

Dom walks to the beat of the music <a href="">0:04</a>



Every comment be like:Back when they were only racing...

It’s crazy how this movie is now 22 years old

when FF was great

I prefer this kind of fast and furious. Not the other ones with films becoming too high tech with mercenaries, global terrorism and submarines. I like it when it involves just criminal gangs and street racers.

You killed my friend. Think I&#39;m gonna let that fly?

This film was so good compared to the rest of the dogshit films that followed. 2fast 2furious was okay.

Paul Walker is way better than that actor Keanu Reeves.

Honestly, still waiting for Jessie to miraculously return to the franchise 

which song in the beginning???

Part of me is still holding out as Johnny Tran was saved and is a cyborg whos been behind ALL of this and itll be revealed in Fast 37

We don’t get in to that.

He Shot Just Below His Lungs So He Had To Live

Brian He Just Below Anuff To Take Him Down With His 45 Automatic. Nothing To Kill Him But Just Anuff To Put Him Down And He Checked His Vitals Afterwards.  Now A Smaller Calbiuer Would Have Most Likely To Him Out.  Even From 15 To 20 Feet Away

Its Possible Johnny Tran And Lance Made It Outta The Fight.  I Lance Did.  He Was Stunned Johnny Tran Was Shot In His Side But It&#39;s Possible He Did Live Some How Though

Badass car man  <a href="">0:09</a>
So im guessin lance isnt dead

Tran survived this and will seek for revenge in the next F&amp;F

<a href="">1:58</a> Holy s that was horrible 

You know what I don’t get.. how come Brian uses nos in a very steep downhill? Shouldn’t that Supra have wings and fly across the city 

It is cheesy but it has a simple and good story, good cinematography, and good acting for the most part. I wish this franchise stuck to its roots.

Dom Kill Lance

22 years of this movie, and i swear this movie makes my happy when i see

The way they changed the sounds of the cr250 aha

Universal is dead.

The guy shooting had unlimited ammo 

<a href="">1:41</a> w music

This entire soundtrack is sick. Which is it by BT?

Dom's car has the most stylish nose near the outside 
Ceh dom even took the car to chase his naughty friend
Cant believe when you compare this to new fast 9 shooting guns on the air like star wars

What&#39;s the name of the song playing in the background?

Lance fired all those rounds and didn’t reload once. This was pre-John Wick firearm realism in movies.

Paul is the reason i have an eclipse.

Nice car

<a href="">0:34</a> temazo.

What’s the lil beat song name in the beginning

<a href="">1:50</a>

Faster

So funny when people say they miss the old movies when they were about racing. FF never was about racing, cars just had a bigger part in the movies but it was always an action movie. Yes, they totally overdo with the action scenes in the new movies. Logic and physics almost don&#39;t exist but I really enjoy that. Action movies don&#39;t need to be realistic in my opinion.

Back when dom and brian still drive a car like a normal

I&#39;ve always thought that was a pretty cool kill by Brian.

Lance is definitely not dead.

What’s the name of this song

See, this is how you make a action scene with balls. No dramatic trombone music, no flying drone camera angles or any of that stupid s*it.

I wish this was the last fast and furious

The score for this scene is  

Po
WHY can&#39;t they make movies like this anymore!?

meh ded bight meh a slurpa

Dukes of Hazzard and Fast and Furious are the reasons why I want a 2nd gen Charger

Shooting like a stormtrooper

What is the name of first song? Please

My homie really loves Don&#39;s car the orange one

Back when Dom didn&#39;t have Infinity Stones

This badass stop and shooting in the end is so cool, they still didn&#39;t maked anything cooler than this in the following 8 movies, bruh. F&amp;F turned into some strange Indian movie.

Paul will always be remembered Rest in Peace Paul Walker

just hearing that Hemi start 

The coolest cop car in existence

I love  the cars so so so much especially the big badass  Dodge Charger

I always expected lance to come back looking for revenge after Brian killed Johnny I hope before the series ends Lance appears one last time

<a href="">1:55</a> whatd he kick out?

Killers be like is that a supra!!!!!

True Crime: Streets of LA.

Dom: Time for extraction planMia: NO DOM NO

Do

Name of the song in this video??

<a href="">0:35</a>

“This is officer Brian O’Conner in pursuit of two motorcycles involved in a drive by shooting. Back up requested.” Or something to that effect seems more logically now that his cover is blown, but it just wouldn’t be as cool ya know.

<a href="">0:04</a> <a href="">0:12</a> <a href="">0:13</a> <a href="">0:15</a> <a href="">0:16</a> <a href="">0:17</a><a href="">0:35</a> <a href="">0:36</a> <a href="">0:37</a> <a href="">0:45</a><a href="">1:48</a> <a href="">1:49</a> <a href="">1:51</a> <a href="">1:52</a> <a href="">1:53</a> <a href="">1:54</a> <a href="">1:55</a> <a href="">1:56</a> <a href="">1:59</a><a href="">2:12</a> <a href="">2:19</a> <a href="">2:22</a> <a href="">2:23</a> <a href="">2:26</a> <a href="">2:27</a> <a href="">2:28</a> <a href="">2:29</a> <a href="">2:30</a> <a href="">2:32</a> <a href="">2:33</a><a href="">2:36</a> <a href="">2:37</a> <a href="">2:42</a> <a href="">2:43</a> <a href="">2:44</a>

Johnny had a smg to kill Brian, Brian only needed 5 shots to kill Johnny.

This is what Johnny and Lance get forDestroyed Brian eclipseShot Jesse car Killed Jesse

<a href="">0:45</a> There is no way Johnny missed 100 shots at that range while spraying and praying. (Yes I know a Mac 10 realistically can’t hold a 100 shots in a stick mag that short but its Hollywood. What do you expect)

i miss the old fast and furious so much where paul walker was playing in movies back then the whole world sucks without him around

<a href="">1:44</a> SLAM YOUR BRAKES

the film is very good
<a href="">0:13</a> you hear that? That’s the sound of a monster awakening

Never-ending bullets

It’s crazy thinking this masterpiece came out back in 2000. I was a kid when it did, loved growing up around this time. Back when it was all about that hip life.

That silenced pistol has a lot of ammunition.

I want movies tomorrow together
Pesano filmes gora iba
<a href="">0:13</a> the Charger startup departs<a href="">0:35</a> NOS<a href="">1:51</a> Dom bumps Lance<a href="">2:25</a> Brian shoots Johnny

Not from Gary&#39;s family

Here is what we can learn from this scene: 1. Villain&#39;s bullets crushes all nearby cars into pieces, but no bullet hits the good guy&#39;s car2. Gastrointestinal tract injury immediately stops the heartAdd more

the bike&#39;s engine sound is amazing

God, What a film.

Brian got it back in blood for jesse

was this suppose to fit perfectly with yakety sax at 1.5?

yur

I need name of song at the begining, please I can&#39;t find it anywhere

Jesus Christ how many bullets can you have in one SMG

I&#39;m watching the fast and furious HD clip

When Jesse got shot, Brian changed. For thats family

I get chills from this scene, the dirt bike part my favorite

did nobody see the mess up on the movie <a href="">1:50</a> the red bike hits doms car from the side but keeps going and flyes off

<a href="">1:51</a>

<a href="">0:15</a> strong engine

When fast and furious wasn&#39;t mission impossible

Since Tran and Lance just committed 3 counts of attempted murder, possession of illegal arms and 1 count of first degree murder their parents can’t bail them out of this one.

Brain&#39;s supra is jumping high as a rally car

Moment of silence for the 2 stars that are gone: Paul Walker... and now that Supra :(

Man the good old days when the camera was shaking like an earthquake and confusing me where to look so much

I miss you Paul 
Jesus died and rose 3 days later for our sins

You can’t beat the start up of that beast of a charger

Takes me back to my childhood glad I got 96 civic pure nostalgia

This supra was legendry!

<a href="">0:04</a> When you see there’s an available PS5 at your Best Buy.

<a href="">0:04</a> me completely ignoring the cashiers greeting me and asking if I need assistance as I walk to get a can of seafoam at my auto parts store

This scene is epic

They did this scene wrong in this movie Jesse got shot in his leg and twice in his arm and survivedAnd in part 2  Brian visits him in the hospital then Brian goes on the run Jesse comes back in 4 or 5 especially part 5 along with Vince but didn&#39;t happen 

After watching the 9th movie of the franchise it&#39;s nice to look back and see that physics used to be alive

Sad

Fast and Furious is an example on how to stretch a film franchise to the point where is about to rip

Do the police just not exist in this world?

<a href="">0:13</a> my favorite car

<a href="">2:44</a> ngl that face looks like jpg

Black bike name pls



They need to put this movie back on Netflix

Old fast and furious based of street racing and cop chasing Now fast and furious: guns, fights and no more street racing

<a href="">1:01</a> - you can see the production ramps that the stunt drivers used to jump the vehicles.

here because of the los santos tuners update in gta online

I like how this movie is so 80s

<a href="">0:04</a> Me on my way looking for Beans

Walking after my best friend has been shot would be the last thing I would do if I was trying to catch the killers

Damn
People: “fAsT anD fuRiOuS is oNlY aBoUt rAcInG!”Also Fast and Furious: <a href="">2:21</a>

How much bullet contain that uzi 

<a href="">0:04</a> dom turns his back on family

<a href="">0:01</a> <b>when a guy with opressor kills ur friend in gta online</b>

RIP Paul :(

Unlimited ammo uzi
From all the chargers that Dominic has driven, in my opinion this is the best charger ever, all original looking with big tires in the back i love it

Aww..back when they were actually relying on the laws of physics more realistically

<a href="">0:53</a> he shot to windshield from back? :D wtf

2021 anyone?

POV: When that one kid owes you money

Since the series has gone so unpredictable with all these deaths I’m guessing Mr. Nobody was hiding some where underneath that tunnel and Johnny Tran And Lance fake their deaths.

This is what GTA v online was like before the rocket bikes and deluxos

<a href="">1:14</a> Is when you can see the shattered glass on Brian’s Supra. It’s crazy that there’s a blooper!

The music in this is so memorable! Everytime I think of this scene I hear <a href="">1:01</a>, or <a href="">0:35</a>The tracks in F&amp;F 4 - 8 I can&#39;t recall besides a couple like &quot;See You Again&quot; and &quot;We Own It.&quot; But those weren&#39;t really ambient tracks like these ones.

I like this movie

<a href="">0:19</a> man, bryan&#39;s hair is beautiful

This scene is better than the whole F9 movie

1000mag uzi
<a href="">1:14</a> wind shield broken for just one shots 

That Supra belongs in the Smithsonian

<a href="">1:18</a> beautiful shot.

I always used to be cracking up when he flipped off his dirt bike at <a href="">1:59</a>

I’ve always found the shot of them jumping down the street, combined with the subdued music, to be so striking <a href="">1:01</a>

they should have later pretended that Jesse survived the drive by gunshot so that he could come back to F9.

Dom and brain brother hood 

<a href="">0:45</a> Johnny: <b>tries to shoot Brian&#39;s car</b>Also him: <b>shoot at the random car</b> lmao  bad AIM

<a href="">0:37</a>  The epic background music really puts the adrenaline into maximum overdrive.

<a href="">0:36</a>  Hit it!

How many bullets those uzis carry?

Bt

Damnnnnn that gun had alot of  bullets hahahah

Just noticed that <a href="">0:29</a> and <a href="">1:20</a> are the exact same shot used twice!

<a href="">1:54</a>What is that he kicks off his foot when he jumps the bike?A safety strap for the stunt man?

Anyone else notice how Dom&#39;s triceps flexes to the beat of the song?

<a href="">0:35</a>
Justice for Johnny Tran

They really don’t make movies like this anymore :(

20 years...

It&#39;s been 20 y.r ago woww

So this is the original dubbing of Fast and Furious, I already watched the entire saga but honestly the one I liked the most was the first, the second, the third and the 4th, the rest are there but well the ones I liked the most were those
What did he kick with his foot when he fell on the bike?

Cut at the best part: CALL 911!

Will a girl provide first aid and call the police? Damn the defenders.
I love this scene

look closely at <a href="">1:01</a>, you can see they are jumping off ramps

R.I.P paul

After this movie came out the world couldn’t wait for them need for speed underground games on ps2/Xbox no Bull

I didn&#39;t know bike crash can kill u?

I really like this video
The first movie is the best of all Fast and Furious movies.

Dam fnf was good man

Everybody praises the orange supra. Yes, its definitely iconic but man, that charger is just so damn cool and ill forever want one

<a href="">1:10</a>

I love it how when Brian fires his gun, it sounds like a movie-cliched silencer. You know <b>joop joop joop</b> in reality, silencers are more like a loud <b>pss pss pss</b>

the fast and the furious is the only movie in this franchise with raw scenes.  This and Tokyo Drift somewhat.everything else since has been just junk.

Motocross bike could never keep up with a car lmao

All this and no cops

best movie ever
It is given to surpa
Is dat a supranational?
Our childhood YT channel , it always summarizing the whole movie

what kind of gun is that?

<a href="">0:53</a> :no one Me : my aim on gta

Recommended me after 9 years

If I saw a Supra coming at me I’d freak out

<a href="">0:03</a> fashion show

Yet

That’s that Cold War mac

how tf they got so many bullets

I love this moves I like fast cars

When Dom walks to his car instead of run, you better start praying

That’s two killers on the bikes being taken down by Dominic and Brian

Sweet movie

Take note this is the Same Year Mister Roger&#39;s Neigbourhood Ended

Wow that soundtrack is now the new classic. Very nostalgic and look at the actions scenes and the sound effects... oh the good old days!!!

Why doesn&#39;t Lance make a comeback in one if the new movies for revenge?

Based on a true story.

What brands are those motorcycles?
Doms car was sick

I wish I could see this movie on 4DX..

Harry your alive! And you&#39;re a terrible shot!

How did we get from this to nuclear weapons, super agents and shit Hahaha it's losing more and more meaning
How did we go from this to bikes becoming transformers and the heroes fighting cyborgs

Crap seriously !Johnny Tran was amazing character with so much potential for the future films !

Why is the road empty?

2021

This oldschool music is awesome...Got directly this 90er vibes 

Seriously how many bullets are in them guns surely the bikers would of had to reload 

Missing paul Walker:(

Dirt bikes are outrunning a car that can smoke a Ferrari????

Ok but he didn’t even run to his car just a mild speed walk

arm

stop singl

damn it&#39;s 2021...
arm

Dude in the background was just minding his buisness

The best proven actor and the going liveing time in him everything he wanted to be to everyone

He is the worlds topest fastest driver

Whats the name of the song?

<a href="">2:33</a> the on the back he is like minding his own business. That’s gun shots??? Whatever I must keep walking like there is no dead people behind me.

Motorcycle guy 1: <b>Slams into side of doms car</b>Also Motorcycle guy 1: <b>Flies off a mountain at full speed</b>

Oh man

His dad&#39;s charger is daddy of God

The first wheelie he did in this movie was hot the other ones were ok but this wheelie in the movie WAS HOT!

bro rip paul walker

How on earth can a motorcycle outrun a supra

So what do the guys on the motor cycles just have infinite rounds



<a href="">0:35</a> BT - Enter The Eclipse

wow empty street, what day was that on? sunday?

Well Lance should still be alive but Johnny Tran bit the dust

IM A ELITE GODLY JOCK OF 2020 🇹🇹️
I used to love this scene a fuckton when I was a kid, until I noticed they reused scenes and took out cars for some and then brought them back in another.noticing that kinda ruined this for me, but hey I still love this movie overall

I love you Toyota supra

As I’m a fan of the film like this paul Walker will be much missed

I thought suppressed weapons hides the muzzle flash.

.

when the movies were good before they drived the franchise into the ground .

The machine gun  never seem to run out of bullets lol

So that supra wasn&#39;t fast enough to catch some dirt bikes without nitrous? It supposed to beat a supercharged bigblock race car?

Nostalgia
The way he pulled up and blasted Johnny with that 45 was so smooth. That was such a great shot, they don’t do anything that classy in the following 6 movies and it makes me sad.

Ibrahim
Fast and the furious 10 they return tran and Lance return

My favorite part <a href="">1:51</a>

That techno beat with the Charger rolling out awakened a love for cars in me as a kid that will never fade.

F&amp;F best scene

Their accuracy is worse than stormtroopers&#39;

At <a href="">1:55</a> he said &quot;Looks like team rocket&#39;s blasting off again&quot;

He escaped before the car blew up

Han is still alive

Good that you run
No. That. Fast 1

Fast 2. Nothing

I hate Johnny Tran
<a href="">0:13</a>Still remains my favourite car in the entire franchise. The almighty 1970 Dodge Charger. This car is a beast!

I bet you they gonna name drop Jesse in fast 9

What a good shot now
<a href="">2:39</a>  I bet you couldn&#39;t tell Ford had a chunk of sponsorship dunked into this movie.  lol

<a href="">0:30</a> this will always be my second favorite part in this movie

9 years later, if you&#39;re watching this you&#39;re a legend.

<a href="">0:35</a> i love the music

If only Universal didn&#39;t milk the Fast and Furious franchise when it became more silly and flashy and after Paul Walker&#39;s passing.

<a href="">0:35</a> is the best moment

That supra is a legend for sure

This is the chase that made the supra g of jdm

Soundtrack?
This is like boyz in da hood

I love the walk up to the charger

The trance music really suits it

Song?

While Filming this the guy on the red bike actually broke his leg during this.

I miss paul walker
are these asians strorm troopers?

<a href="">0:04</a> whats the original beat? know thats BT but title?

Play stupid games, wins stupid prizes!!! Lmfao.

The 20 speed gearboxes, the 30 mile runway and the 500 shot magazines.

Strange seeing the cars and bikes driving down a real road 

Their do their guns look like a suppressed smg from Fortnite

<a href="">0:04</a> My grandfather has a 67 Chevelle SS all black he gave me,  first time I went to drive it I walked like dom and thought of this scene exactly lol

Still can&#39;t believe they haven&#39;t brought Johnny Tran back from the dead yet ........... Maybe in Fast 10 he will be as some sort of cyborg ninja vowing revenge following on from the rest of nonsense with returning characters to the series.

Moral of the story you shouldn&#39;t welcome Chinese to America

This movie deserved an Oscar compared to the sequels.

Confirmed Johnny Tran Will back in Fast 13

Bro when dom walks up to his car, gives me chills lol.

this scene always bugged me how the uzi had unlimited ammo and he never had to reload.

It amazing how they can hit all thw other car but not even one bullet on his car .

The good old Fast and Furious. Back when it used to be about cars and racing.

can someone tell me the soundtracks from <a href="">0:05</a> and <a href="">0:35</a> ???

Dude&#39;s firing a mac like a airsoft
Isn’t the guy DK from Tokyo drift? No? Just me? Ok...

YES! I have a Fast and Furious car! <a href="">2:40</a> I had that exact color and year Ford Taurus Wagon!

R.i.p paul walker

I really love this chase scene and it’s awesome and cool

Just could not understand why the streets were so empty without traffic...

THAT&#39;S A LOT OF DAMAGE

<a href="">0:41</a>gonna eat you up !!

Cleb

<a href="">0:34</a> in my opinion one the best parts in the whole movie

They got trash aim fr

<a href="">1:59</a> that sounds like it kinda hurts

They need to play this song in one of the fast and furious movies as a way of saying &quot;okay we get it this us the last movie no more after this&quot;

Watashi Wa tanin you have to catch her. They just passed by on the motorcycle.
Good movie Rest In Peace  Paul

Love you

Nobody:The charger and Supra: <b>you wanna see some real speed</b>

It’s great that Dom ignored Mia’s pleas not to get involved. Otherwise Brian would have gotten killed if you think about it.

<a href="">1:16</a> pause it, Did you see head?

Swear to god,if i found out the paul walker&#39;s homie that makes paul died at crash still alive,im gonna bust his damn ribs, wash his hair using gasoline, and throws a wooden match at that

<a href="">0:22</a> my love video :X

Public lobbies in GTA in a nutshell

Nice drive for Paul &#39;s Toyota supra. 
I miss this kind of fast and furious 

Brian Transitions from a cop....... its a great scene!!!!

<a href="">0:45</a> Funny how he hit everything but the Supra. Next time he should try to aim for everything else.

Paul washer....we miss u brian...

Jordana looks good in that scene.

Fast and furious make the Toyota supra famous

It&#39;s an amazing machine....r.i.p lance

Look at that Dom has now left his girlfriend with Jessie lying dead in her arms

Tran&#39;s sidekick&#39;s dirt bikes are fast and they used gta hacks.

leave hello
Did anyone else notice the mannequin leg twisted <a href="">1:54</a>

Vin Diesel Looked So good back then
When this franshise had more Drive and less nonsense.Sad.

Song????

Plot twist: so you know in F&amp;F Tokyo drift? The bikers are actually the idiots with the 350Z’s. And in 1 of the F&amp;F guys on motorbikes had SMG’s which they have here. So the bikers are the kids with the 350Zs.

The second shooter look like Han

when that guy fell down the hill lmao

Fast 1 &amp; 3 are by no doubt the best in the franchiseThis was the official remake of Point Break

I get goosebumps when he presses the nos button

Me every time I get in my car <a href="">00:03</a>

ANDRÉ SOUZA DE CERQUEIRA
His aim is potato like holy

LollllThey got pinged in the end...

Plot twist: the car was saying “Dom yes” when Mia was saying “Dom no”. You couldn’t hear it because Dom has challenger powers

RIP  Paul Walker

<a href="">0:04</a> me when my friends make jokes and don't call me
I miss you paul

To think if the got 13mil views think of the actual movie

<a href="">2:23</a> The way Brian immediately pops out his semi automatic and starts shooting at Johnny was just so smooth and amazing

Then Dom is jumping cars from skyscraper to skyscraper in Dubai 14 years later.

Triceps bigger than my future

Just peeped they reused a few clips in the chase ‍️ and copy-pasted the clip of the Supras first jump as the second jump

Notice the person the purple just walking randomly in the background after Brian takes out Tran? Like, what the hell? Lol

yesss paul walker is survive yes go go !!

<a href="">0:35</a> Brian O’Conner time in Fast and Furious!

Hello, someone else speaks Spanish, for me who speaks Spanish it is a shame that the movie is in English
Cars are better than bikes

Movie error - if you pause at <a href="">1:02</a> you can see the ramp the cars go on ️

When Mia looked good

mili

best part whole video on <a href="">0:34</a>

Back in the day when these movies were good. I could have never imagined the shitstorm this franchise would become. RIP Paul, RIP F&amp;F.

Dom walks to his car so manly

Remember that When Brian Was About to Race Was our Brother

writ

What are they guns or lollipop shooters....

I’m sorry but, I can’t deal with Mia’s body so skinny 

<a href="">0:03</a> - THE HYPE

Funny how there&#39;s no cars on the street in the middle of the day in LA.

Man I could feel Dom’s rage when Jesse died

Love Paul but the rest is garbage!

You are a legend movie clips

Apparently someone turned on infinite ammo

Soo all the bullets Tran fired miraculously the supra missed them

Locks not mmmes

Why fast and the furious went from good street races into a gta lobby

They should make a fast and furious game based off this fast and furious movie

<a href="">0:03</a> and <a href="">0:13</a> music to my ears

Am I the only one who thinks that supra needs a wash 

I love this

RIP (BRIAN)PAUL WALKER

ghkky

Win Brian&#39;s Toyota Supra Aerotop in Fast &amp; Furious Presents Hobbs &amp; Shaw - Downfall.

I thought Johnny Tran (Rick Yune) was still in the Honda S2000.

Everyone knows if speed kills in the charger r/t that&#39;s &#39;cause it&#39;s got V10 from the Dodge Viper.

Dom&#39;s Dodge Charger R/T: (engine screaming)
Jesse (Chad Lindberg) gets killed by the killers &amp; both Dom &amp; Brian (Paul Walker &amp; Vin Diesel) chase &#39;em down.

When Dom stormed toward and got into the beast itself, you knew it was over

I watch this move since I was 2 and that is when i fell in love with car culture

I wanna know what dirt bikes their riding

Oh if only these characters knew what was in for them in the later movies.

Hhm an Uzi holds up to 40 rounds... shoots 500 per minute... so it&#39;s empty after 5 seconds continuous fire... and those guys were firing about the of the half time in this scene, about 1,5 minutes, meaning they needed 750 rounds in that magazine... hollywood at its best

Cool

This. Well. Am. A. Fan. Fast. Y. Furious
<a href="">0:12</a> Broo 
Call 911...YOU CALL 911!!!!

Can you imagine that this move was nearly 20 years ago. DAMN

<a href="">2:31</a>Wait a minute, is that brian painted on the wall?

I still dont under stand how much bullets are in his uzi

The point is when the villain shot, it can&#39;t hit the main character

RIP paul Walker u will always be a great actor who always drives suit up cars

Has anyone noticed that they used 2 of the same shots?

I don’t care what everyone says..yeah after fast 4 we forgot what racing was but all the story ..cmon guys..I love all F&amp;F!!

that Supra will still look good 50 years from now.

Pray
Right as the Fast and Furious music came on, it was on.

Storm trooper accuracy
When I bought my 4K HDR copy a few months ago, I noticed this after 15 years:At <a href="">1:14</a>/<a href="">1:16</a> a guy in white shirt on the balcony (left house) was filming the Supra&#39;s jump scene! I think he was very lucky to stay at home during those filming &quot;quarantine days&quot; Note: Damn, this graphic and light effects are very gorgeous...a lot of differences between this and the VHS version in 480p.

That race party music though lmao

Just a normal gta5 bike chase

Imagine if this chase scene happened today. Physics would not exist

I love the music in this scene

I have the 1 first movie on DVD, it&#39;s still sad that we lost paul in a car wreck in 2013, RIP Paul Walker

Great shot Brian R.I.P Paul Walker can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gone the franchise&#39;s is not the same without his presence thank u Paul 4 entertaining your fans

The right thing to do avandge

.

<a href="">0:03</a> when your boss tells you you can leave early on a Friday.

They should have themselves checked now.  Johnny tran and his goon are chinese and might have corona virus.

2 stroke bike and 4 stroke sounds :DD

RIP Paul

Nice

<a href="">2:23</a> i some how liked that Brian is using a simple small gun

How many bullets does that gun hold???? Yes!!!

hey guys, what is the name of the music at <a href="">00:03</a> ???

Is this the Crew Where you Crash people Cars

That supra is beast

<a href="">00:34</a> always excited me as a little kid and it still does till this day :’))

80% of this comment section: Remember when it was all about the fast cars and racing? Now it’s about X,Y, and Z

Still the best fast n furious 

I miss when movies looked like this, the camera quality and colors just look so good

<a href="">2:25</a> I guess Paul walker forgot to turn on his aimbot

HOW MANY AMMO DOES THE GUY IN THE MOTORCYCLE HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Typical day in the life of gta 5

That Dodge Charger rev is just an eargasm

<a href="">0:52</a> Nice aiming bro....

Dodge supra
remember when fast and furious was just about street racing with actual cars and no crazy over the top cgi action?

Who&#39;s here after f9 trailer?
If Lety and Han can survive car explosions, then Johnny Tran and Lance is still alive for sure.

Does anyone know the name of that first song as doms walking to the charger??

I wonder how they&#39;ll explain Johnny&#39;s resurrection in Fast and the Furious 10

This movie is so good

That monster
I like the jpeg screenshot crop zoomed in on <a href="">0:36</a>

It would be great just having an unlimited mag on a gun wouldn’t it

I swear that Supra had unlimited NOS.

<a href="">0:04</a> stripper music
Fast and the furious movies are the best

Truly my personal favorite scene in the movie!

Why would they switch to a dirt bike then a super sport bike what were they thinking??

<a href="">2:29</a> there was a shopping cart on the sidewalk <a href="">2:36</a> but it vanished. Who would ever leave a shopping cart in the middle of a sidewalk under the bridge

Toreto I want to be like you
Poor Paul, who lived only 40 years old, died when I went to 1st grade, rest in peace! But you are alive in our hearts and thoughts

WHY  DID PAUL  WALKER   DEAD

Anybody just here to see the car

I love you
The best fast and furious movie the others are not so good
Poul Walter 
Does someone know the name of the initial song

<a href="">1:51</a>

R.I.P Paul Walker  Always be in our hearts  Always gonna be with us     He didn&#39;t deserve death 
Paul Walker was always a good actor. I&#39;m still sad since he died :(

This and Tokyo drift are the best F&amp;F movies

<a href="">0:03</a> what&#39;s the name of the song?

The killer to Jess was Johnny Tran since getting revenge on dom because he beat Johnny up and Jess losing to johnny

<a href="">0:03</a> when bully of my friend makes me mad I chase him

<a href="">1:50</a>

Justice for Jesse.

You... you... call NINEWUNONE!!!!!!

Paul walker is the reason I love Japanese cars so much plus he&#39;s my hero for that

<a href="">2:23</a>This is for the Eclipse.

<a href="">0:04</a>I&#39;m with you, Dom.They took the Eclipse and Jesse.

Dammm... That hand gun have so many bullets

HU

Are the streets really that dusty in California? Jeez

This is what gta v online is likePlayers with extended clips and modded cars

The music of this scene sounds like the intro level music of robocop vs terminator on the sega megadrive

<a href="">0:35</a> When you&#39;re in a hurry to get a new video game.

To think that they went from this to being chased by a nuclear submarine...

Am I the only one who likes Nitro?
My favorite clip ️️Background music + car sound = awesome 
The first 10 seconds is the best! So perfect how Dom&#39;s triceps are flexing to the beat of the music.

Laisitegusta. the bullfight movie
<a href="">2:45</a> why does he look like that dude from fast and furious 3

HUFNE

I need the song <a href="">0:01</a>

Hello

<a href="">0:03</a> when you buy your first car and you want to drive her

<a href="">2:27</a> when I win and I realize it&#39;s 1 in the morning

Me when a Lamborghini pulls up for a race <a href="">0:04</a>

<a href="">0:04</a> when my dad go to school to see my record book..

Does anybody know the street in the <a href="">0:30</a>??I want it exactly

no one messes with Dom&#39;s family and gets away with it

name of the bikes??

You mess with one of us, you mess with the both of us!

yeah no theres no way in hell that supra cant catch up to to those dirtbikes

The intro music is sooooo early 2000sI miss those days

If they had there crotch rockets they would of got away easier

Owning a 2003 mitchibishi eclipse i would take any car from fnf supra and the 98 eclipise especially

I love import cars

This is what happens when you&#39;re Vietnamese and you try to kill american people without hiding among the trees.

<a href="">0:27</a> and <a href="">1:20</a>  the same shot?

Such an underwhelming death scene

R.I.P Paul Walker still hard to believe you passed away

Sorry, but I will forever prefer Muscle, to Import

I Love this vídeo 
Where is all the traffic lool

The best FnF films have the asian dude in the red bike.

At least Lance lived....

Hahaha surprise!

There&#39;s no way that gun has that big of a clip

Notice the exhaust on the red dirt bike is to a 2 stroke but making 4 stroke sounds

Has anyone ever noticed that they passed by that old red Lincoln about 70 times?

He died and the franchise died with him

So the chinese cousin is alive.. they could bring him back for revenge

It was him who killed han

This 3 minute clip alone is better then the new movie. :|

You thetre kloj

Yo how much ammo is in this dude&#39;s gun.... got a mag of 200 in a sub

That dude will kill it as a Stormtrooper. Hits everything else but the car he&#39;s aiming at.

Tran is the best villain in the series.

Ok

Fhfog

So... the guy Tran just went from selling stolen stuff and car racing to murder for a car?Shortly after the cops raided his stock?Ok...

<a href="">1:02</a> Can&#39;t unsee those ramps 

<a href="">0:00</a>-<a href="">0:20</a> When we of your friends die in gta and 1 of them is being over dramatic and 2 of them get there revenge for the friend

Best movie of 2001

Name of the song?

Real smart doing wheelies while trying to get away from a crime scene and being chased. Definitely a priority.

rest in peace Paul &lt;3 now that i look back it just makes me feel sad.

They should have used this song in the final film

So is the windshield of the supra broken or nah

Who here In 2019

When you find out a new season of fortnite is out <a href="">0:07</a>

<a href="">0:44</a> No way 1 magazine lasts that long

<a href="">0:04</a> Walking to little bro room to smack him

Supra is so fast that it dodges bullets! Should be called the Toyota Matrix!

2019? R.i.p paul
The most realistic film in the series

Yup, ALL about cars and racing

B  mM

This movie is such royalty it should be off of All Platforms. This could be put up out of stock  for being so iconic. And they bring the movir back  out at the movie theaters every 2 years. That would be special.

Thji
Dom gettin in the car is badass as is.

I feel bad for the supra

R.I.P Paul Walker is Best actor Ever

When I see Dom marching towards his dads charger I feel the tension of the scene

In Hollywood:charger is the beastIn real life:supra is the beast I miss these cars and we only get to see cars with weird modifications and stunts that mock Newton himself in the remaining sequels

<a href="">1:15</a> that guy in the house taking a photo

My favorite car on the movie 1970 Challenger

<a href="">18:19:20</a>Brian and Dom bring justice and kill the Asians!LONG FOR THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS!2001Success in Brazil!
I need  the soundtrack plox:》

One of the killers is the guy that beat that guy jesse with his honda

So, this dude just can&#39;t aim!! He sniped every car on the road but Brian&#39;s car 

Brian has good accuracy with a 1911 pistol

the motorcyclist&#39;s guns have to be the pistol equivalent of the AK-47: hits everything besides exactly what you&#39;re aiming for

Watching this in 2019 I swear vin diesel is Ricardo Milos

When u unlock the extended mag attachment in cod

All this over a Jetta.

Dude is that a supra!?

Byr

Does anyone know what&#39;s the music Dominic is walking to the car? From <a href="">0:00</a> - <a href="">0:35</a> It&#39;s unbelievable that i cannot find it anywhere!

<a href="">0:02</a> I also had this lol I was playing this song on my jbl and someone was chasing someone because of theft so I ran up to my bike lol felt like the same haha coincidence

Imagine a 2000hp supra trying to catch those bikes

<a href="">00:04</a> that startup tho

Miss you Brian

That Supra looks like a Fisher Price toy compared to that Charger lol I&#39;m glad those tuner fads are gone.

<a href="">1:59</a> that guy kept falling when he didn&#39;t need to

What name song?

Poor jesse
Waht is the

<a href="">1:52</a> surprise motherf**ker!

I love fast and furious 1

This Charger is beautiful

<a href="">0:04</a> badass

<a href="">0:47</a> Pontiac? Trans am?

Dom don&#39;t play when It come to his family!

<a href="">0:12</a> and the beast has awaken.

Does anyone know what the song from the very beginning is called?

I like how vehicle accidents happen next to Los Angeles graffiti like this and the movie Fallen Down

Lorena

One of the best moments in all of the fast and the furious movies this will always be my fav part

The song that is used sounds like the one that is used during The Fitness Test.(we will now begin the push-up section)

fish.
This song??

<a href="">0:54</a> If you look on the car window you can see the cameraman

<a href="">1:55</a>-<a href="">1:58</a> Weeeee yahooooo LOL
<a href="">0:03</a> how I walk to my mustang bullit 2018

The Fast and The Furious franchise is still a great franchise in my eyes even The Fate of The Furious wasn&#39;t as bad as people said, I actually enjoyed it because of Mark Sinclair&#39;s exceptional and emotional performance though I&#39;m more of a Paul Walker fan even before the Fast and Furious movies were made.P.S Mark Sinclair and Paul Walker are the real Dynamic Duo in my eyes.Edit: What would actually surprise some people is that some of the stunts in this movie were performed by Paul Walker himself because he can handle tuned up cars though his stunt double looked a lot like him from a far because he had the same haircut and skin color as well as same outfit.

<a href="">2:56</a>

The fast and the furious why not fast and furious?

fast and furious fire fire
Has a Mac 10 gun still missesHas a tiny pistol and gets some hits

I’m surprised how the Supra doesn’t have an bullet holes. 

Infinite ammo cheat?

Paul walker s toyota supra i like his car in the orginal movie

I love this movie

I had the hot wheels version of Brian&#39;s supra when i was a kid and I&#39;d get so hyped to drive it around whenever this scene came up

I&#39;ve always been bothered by the fact that they&#39;re Mac-11s had unlimited ammo. In reality it would only take about 1.37 seconds to empty the magazine.

Man those nerds don&#39;t even know how to shoot on the bike

My brother, I like them very much, they are the best, I miss them, I'm waiting for them to start again soon 
How I Walk When Im Wanting a Wawa Sandwich

<a href="">2:29</a> Are they ok?I mean the camera man.

This is my favorite scene my childhood is here !

I dont get it <a href="">1:53</a>-<a href="">1:54</a> place. He hits the car in <a href="">1:53</a> by side, in <a href="">1:54</a> he drives like he missed the road :D :D normally in that kind of speed even if you hit a car by bike side driver totally needs to be throw away from bike :D

As an adult I realize that if they had been street bikes that supra wouls have never caught up with the bikes

I guess they never heard of reloading or bullet shells 

<a href="">1:02</a>, they jumped off a ramp

I would have prefer that Dom was the one Who killed Tran and Brian his cousin

<a href="">0:03</a> yee boiii, Dom got some nice rave moves

What is the name of the Song?

Lance is not dead ??

<a href="">0:50</a> worst aim ever!

Bro it's so much fun

Whats with that power workout music lol

<a href="">0:41</a>- <a href="">1:14</a> Same Building<a href="">0:27</a> - <a href="">1:20</a> Same Street Slope

<a href="">0:04</a> This scene makes up for a lot of the automotive crimes committed by F&amp;F1.

That chargers first roar and it became an instant legend

Oowe you see the ranplas when the motorcycles jump
The music is called Fourth Echo.

Bruh, from street racing and drive by shootings to jumping out of planes and dodging missiles from nuclear submarines 

I love how Dom walks to the beat of the song

ultimate music in all the series is this videos starting seen..i liked it very much

I Totaled my 1st Car thanks to this Movie 

I was thinking it&#39;d be cool if Johnny came back as a villain, if possible lol

RIP Paul Walker

This may be an objectively bad movie, but Jesus Christ I love it (all the others do suck though)

R.I.P Paul Walker

&#39;member when fast and the furious was actually about racing? &#39;member?, you &#39;member!

What is the name of song from <a href="">0:00</a> to <a href="">0:35</a> ????

<a href="">1:05</a> theres ramps

Brian is Back In The Fast &amp; Furious

<a href="">2:20</a> Smoothest gun draw ever
<a href="">1:02</a> Clearly no ramp

Anjay
A mac 10 doesnt have 200 rounds

Not a single bit of CGI, a realistically shot car chase - the fast and furious films really have fallen from grace.

What song is playing

Hi

Dom, you didn’t let the engine warm up before setting off so you should of kept it under 3000 RPM until at operating temperature. 

Piece of shit American muscle. Only good at straight line speed, to an extent. Terrible at everything else

!x

Does anyone know the name of these two bikes?

I want 9 tocome out I watch the rest of dem

<a href="">2:25</a> that face tho

Brap braaap dirt bikes haha
<a href="">0:37</a> Just epic no words needed, the way music changes when Brian pressed the NOS button.

Beautiful
at <a href="">1:29</a> it feel like the black helmet guy was suddenly at the opposite of where he is standing with the red helmet the moment he shake his head to tell his buddy something.

i built the exact same car dom has 900 horse power

I love the sound of the iconic 2jz

anyone know the backround music?

My favorite R.I.P legend (Paul Walker)

Super

Music name??

I miss those times too much, the life was simple and there were real legends in the past. When ı see the film, it reminds me my childhood. We were simple,we were happy with our best friends, we used to play football matches on streets. When I see today&#39;s generation, they look more complicated, they are unhappy because of using mobile phones and pc s too much and friendship is the last thing for new generation.

only thing that would have made this scene better is if Dom would have hit lance with the 12 gauge

I love the soundtrack,goosebumps

Lmao how is it that the gun never runs out of Amo smh‍️‍️
Bullets didn&#39;t even touch the Supra,

NICOLAS

Rest in peace, #1 Paul Walker
Rip Paul walker

PUBG in a nutshell

I think he could’ve landed good <a href="">1:57</a>

Jessie did not die the actor who plays him said that and that he will return for 9 or 10

UNLIMITED.......AMMO

<a href="">2:04</a> Suprised Dom didn&#39;t go down there to finish him.

RIP Paul

I love how under the bridge are all those eyes just peeping Brian&#39;s mad skills

Oregon grown, Paul Walker.
Yeah I know dominic kill lance and brain killed Johnny

R.I.P Paul Walker he is my idol

When I see the dirt bikes and Supra jump it’s so satisfying and with the music the movie was perfect

<a href="">0:35</a> i love that moment

The supras headlights are dirty af

At <a href="">2:02</a> why didn&#39;t he stop?

I was 12 in the 6th grade.

Instagram tags shah we
I wonder how the bikers reloaded after emptying their mags on the crew

I&#39;m so happy they shot everything but the supra :))))) lolol

I&#39;ve just noticed the photographer at <a href="">1:17</a> moving his head on the balcony lol

<a href="">2:39</a> god damn its hillary

That music though

The Lost Boys

I don&#39;t know  why a jdm supra is going on a police pursuit

you can tell its a fake blower by how it sounded

<a href="">0:12</a> The legendary Charger has awoken.

This movie influenced the YouTube car culture some what

That muscle car sounds dangerous
To everyone that didn&#39;t know this, the cousins didn&#39;t use Ingram Mac 10s they use Cobray M11 SMG

Whoever scored this movie did an amazing job

*plotted inaccuracy on guns

I NEVER NARCED ON NOBODY!

The first 2 movies were the best along with Tokyo Drift.

What is the name of the music at the music at the beginning

curious the best and the movie is also the good
the car is faster
Hey don’t there

Look at <a href="">1:55</a>-1-56

Paul walker was my only favourite character in fast and furious

JOHNNY19 JEFFERS19

The sound of the charger when dom starts it up

I was four years old when this came out. Now I’m 20.

Music by BT!

<a href="">2:25</a> when the Chinese delivery guy doesn&#39;t give back the rest of your change  like this if you laughed

i just not noticed after watching this that guy sucked at aiming i mean shit he is shooting from the back of a dirtbick with the kick of the gun but come on

they were shooting at brian and all they hit was the parked cars LMFAO

R.IP. Paul Walker. Gone but never forgotten

the background music was from the first scene...where paul takes the green eclipse for a spin

The Best FF, no matter what!

<a href="">0:52</a> nice shooting
That Supra gave me life

what is the song from 00:0?
Why are they doing tricks while jumping?  :D

<a href="">0:35</a> whats the song??

Dom&#39;s Charger in first F&amp;F movie was the MOST FEAR INDUCING car in the history of cinema. After all these years, I still remember how BRUTAL it sounded at this moment during the plot. Like the car is grunting &quot;watch out I&#39;m coming for you&quot; lol. What a GEM was this movie. Good old days.

How many bullets were in that thing?!

This guy is rich this guy is this guy is rich this guy is Zika
<a href="">1:42</a> Brian should&#39;ve done a brake check on his ass LOL

RIP Paul, from Paul lol 

Lol that moment when you realize he should have been put of ammo after the drive by happened

Is that Lombard Street they&#39;re going down and jumping? That street is in so many movies and TV shows. Is it Lombard?

<a href="">0:05</a> EPIC

That&#39;s what happens when you give the enemy an upper hand or open space. Johnny Tran had to be taken out sometime ago knowing he would attack back.

Anyone know the beat at <a href="">0:04</a> ? I tried looking for it years ago, still no luck. And now... I&#39;m hoping someone knows it and can tell me what&#39;s the name of it so I can download it

<a href="">1:56</a> whats with his leg? Lmao

african moive
And not one bullet hit his car

<a href="">0:01</a>- <a href="">0:10</a> you when she tells you her ex texted her today

He is mad, yet he walks to his car to chase after the shooters?

So wait...did Dom let Lance live?  I don&#39;t get that.

I'm the only one who speaks Spanish
people check that video same but on gta 5 amazing 

Wc hoo

I love the series

I like how they went from pure street racing to some army shit and how there with the fbi and shit

<a href="">1:53</a> first he t bones the bike and it looks like he&#39;s flying off, but then he rides off the side of the road

song?

thanks

soundtrack???please

Best 10 seconds of the movie

Wait Lance survived! They should put him in the again

How many bullets does that clip hold ? 

<a href="">2:00</a> they see me rollin

Look  I&#39;m a super biggest fan ever of then i mostly like everyone in all movies of fate of fourios

I always notice that the Supra is dirty af, once it jumps down its washed

Whats the song

Lose the film
i want Brain car

Me when someone kills my friend on gta

that mac 10 must have a 600 round mag

It&#39;s so realistic, they don&#39;t reload

I cannot believe it has been 16 years... I was 3 years old when this came out I am now 19 years old... and in my opinion the first was the best one out of all of them cause the first one is my favorite one... 

the Angels
cool

the video is good
the video is good
I live in a high crime area, my commute to work is usually like this

Badass part at <a href="">0:34</a>-<a href="">2:32</a> cool music!

Anyone knows the song the plays while Dom is walking to the car?

<a href="">0:50</a> how much ammo does this guy have??

<a href="">1:11</a> RIP bumper - 2001-2001
<a href="">2:35</a>  that looks like hillary clinton

Whoever made that first track is a genius

I couldnt agree more MrTekikott

motor bikes cant out run a Toyota supra
Mopar or no car

2017 WOW MİSS YOU PAUL
Toyota Supra Vs Bike Bandit Chase Kiiler Chasing

dom walking to his car is the same way i walk to my awesome fast and furious prius lmao

If the first movie is not your favourite its the second movie,if the second movie is not your favourite its the third movie,if the third movie is not your favourite its the fourth movie,if the fourth movie is not your favourite and neither are the ones stated above, you just typically don&#39;t like the fast and the furious for what it was.

at <a href="">0:10</a> they got that classic 1990s beat

@ <a href="">1:51</a>: Dom appeared out of nowhere and wins again.

the beginning part of this clip gives me chills every time

This was like a cars vs bikes tag team duel lol

Remember when fast and the furious was a car film now its just heists

This might sound weird but fast and the furious 1 and 2 was the best ones ever made

What is the background song ? Like the instrumental

So many good beat drops

RIP Johnny Tran.

<a href="">0:04</a> epic moment

name of this song

<a href="">0:12</a> that&#39;s the type of muscle that scares me

<a href="">0:13</a> sound s2

I wish Tupac was in that movie did he knew Paul and vin

the charger is a hellmachine hoellenmaschine

They waste a clip and the supra doesn&#39;t even get hit.

ah yes the sounds of the supra <a href="">0:32</a>

<a href="">2:00</a> good bye babies

FAST AND FURIOUS SAFEST 
2JZ sounds are orgasmic I swear.

This scene is fkn badass

I guess Brian also mapped the &quot;next background music track&quot; switch to the NOS button.

what comes off the boot @<a href="">1:54</a>?

what is the soundtrack of the first part??

One is perhaps the best of all the Fast & Furious films
why are the dirtbikes driving in a straight line in the open road instead of going into narrower sideroads where cars will have more trouble? loool

if somebody hasn&#39;t seen the movie or any of them then they live under a rock lol.

Got my driving test today looking at this for motivation to pass 

story, acting, action fucking awesome and superb.but does anyone realize how cringey the writing and direction is? Lol forreal

how did none of those bullets hit Paul walkers car?

<a href="">0:36</a> soundtrack name?

fuckkkkkkkkk

<a href="">1:52</a> im soo confused :O we see the bike hit doms car but then in the next shot the bike rides of the cliff

I love you Paul Walker you always in my heart 
for when furious 9 and 10
song name starts on <a href="">0:35</a>?
