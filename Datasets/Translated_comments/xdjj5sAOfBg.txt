NGL I think I’ll be trying the “tape your legs to table” thing just for fun

Anyone 2024?

man i love watching pewds older videos

<a href="">9:37</a>

&quot;I wonder what these actually look like when real people do them&quot;. que Jenna Marble&#39;s old videos....

I think Felix should play goat simulator 3

Mona lisa looks like beetle juice.
Tampon? Pewds you have a Wife 

Stop Getting 11M Views Maybe That’s Wha Stacked Yiu

Ok everyone i can keep going. Doug was over thrown by Robbie, Jay and Jason stole the livestream and all the Jewels intercepted by Kegin or Elon Musk. Charlie is innocent.

Tommy and Kevin and Jack Lee hacked my emails with Damien and Nosh. Adel and Josh are responsible for sacrificing their daughter. No legs, pp&#39;s(2) meme, and edgar ae the beast curse.

Tommy is responsible for the beast curse. that is why the black angels have dreds and no gold.

Tommys uncle samantha does voodoo against Pewds.
Get all the voodoo dolls out your house and report Marzia is a witch. Jessica

Felix speak into the mic bruh

<a href="">8:26</a> LOLLL, <a href="">12:08</a> (bro is literally dead)

anyone has the link to the first one?

Just a quick warning!!!! Boiling water with electricity won&#39;t work well without an electrolyte. So some people might add salt in order to make the water more conducive, but boiling saltwater with electricity is how you make bleach!

<a href="">1:16</a> they turned the homies from Sarge&#39;s heros into a decoration

Razor blades plus AC sounds like a great idea, especially when you see the colour of the water. Not to mention the massive electrocution risk, assuming they don’t trip the breaker.

<a href="">14:03</a> “tampon”

yes............why .........why this effort

one of the best videos you have made

These people must have been very bored

First world problems be like

That one, life saving west out of empty bottles in emergency could be realy handy

Imagine someone pors hot water on the Ramen u think it will melt or become Ramen noodles

diDIE&gt;<a href="">12:40</a>

JUST BUY A NEW SINK DON&#39;T WASTE FOOD

Five minute crafts is the pestilence that scp 049 had been trying to eradicate!

I suppose like 4 of these could be cool science experiments to impress kids but thats it

Okay I do kinda respect the terra toilet, as a terrarian myself i&#39;d want one

<a href="">7:30</a> Me about to make fake sunroof for my nano

Cancer in your food and drink in some of the hacks lol

there is actually poo in <a href="">3:24</a>

<a href="">6:17</a> I actually showed this one to my dad and he’s made his own amps and electric guitars, and he was like “the fuck these people don’t know how to do this”

The Coca-Cola  was in Ukrainian.

The ending is the most dumb.

I feel like that coke dispenser balloon thing would be something to do, as a sober person, at a house party where everyone else is wasted. The drunks would be absolutely AMAZED! LOL

“I thought DIY will be questioning why you create something but it makes me wonder why I was created”          -Felix 2020

The difference between a “life hack” and just good problem solving is that one identifies an actual problem and solves it, while the other solves an issue that doesn’t exist

DiY videos or <b>how to get less done with more</b>

Bruh I would buy the army dude bowl fuck yea

Hi PewDiePie what are you doing tomorrow?

That last one was gross -.-

<a href="">14:24</a> that wasn’t a fake dog

Why 

<a href="">1:51</a> The balls in the toilet cover LOL

Actually we learned something don&#39;t DIY it&#39;s pointless

Actually he&#39;s probably dead because of the toxic fumes from the hot glue mixing into the coke

&quot;Bro is literally dead because it took so long&quot;

We just gonna ignore the fact he did black face like 5 seconds in 

&quot;There are ceramic spray&quot; Lol

Why Dee Ai Ooaii?Pew die pie!
<a href="">10:18</a> bro made the terra toilet

<a href="">01:34</a> tell us something your mom doesn&#39;t know

<a href="">12:23</a> bro is literally dead bcoz it took really long 

The way he laughs makes me laugh

<a href="">13:04</a> pewds smokes the marijuanas

Why did pewds look like he cried right before recording? :_(

I actually like the gold soldiers thing I wouldn&#39;t buy it but that would be fun to make

<a href="">11:40</a>Felix missed oppurtunity here about how Sweden invented adjustable wrenches lmfao

DILwiay

Plastic bottles can float on water, so that girl sticks plastic bottles around her clothes and tries to swim &amp; float on water. I don&#39;t like it even it works!Some LIFE/DIY hacks are very stupid, you can just buy everything you need!!!

&quot;the video is 11 mins not even 5 mins&quot; HAHAHAHA LMAO

Thank you,

If you can’t pour a drink properly then you’re obviously too young to be Pouring it

I read once that some kids bleached stawberry to turn it white (because they saw it in a 5 Minutes Craft video) and then ate it and got sick.

the. bowl of human suffering is actually quite cool. it was atleast for me artistically very effective at conveying how much we take things for granted.

The romba one is cool ngl

You know I actually found a 5 minute craft that worked it was basically add foil to a pencil eraser and you use it as stylus and I tried it and it worked so if anyone needs a stylus here you go

She made a spoon out of a spoon
There is 62,800,000 impostors among us!

Merry Christmas everybody

<a href="">7:03</a> wait a minute they look familiar......................

God : which one heaven or hell?Pewdiepie: japan

Did they seriously just make an electrode boiler using razor blades...Im pretty sure that makes whatever drink you have at the end actually dangerous, as in it straight up produces a potentially toxic sludge

We need Khaby Lame!!!!

Khaby was talking notes.

Just watched marzia pick his outfits before and he seems to have loved that Japanese brand cavempt

&quot;mabey for handicapped people&quot; if they cant hold the scissors why would they be able to hold that lmao

I watched a 5 minute craft video and it said to microwave a tomato to take its skin off (I kinda dont like tomato skin) when I tried to peel it off I got burned and plus the tomato tasted like water with tomato flavoring.

5 minute drive to your local supermarket

I’m horribly brain dead as I lost brain cells

The hair he glued to his face will just fall of after a few days because if you didn&#39;t know, skin sheds, along with anything on it!

Bruh they are even making diy&#39;s for cigarettes!? The thing that can ruin your life!? That&#39;s probably indirectly killing children by making them think smoking is ok! It&#39;s not like any adult watches this crap!

making a spoon out of a spoon absolute genius

(<a href="">05:47</a>) &quot;I thought DIY would be about questioning why you create something buts its making me question why I was created&quot;Deep

5 minute abominations craftMy comment suck
this video look a little delayed

<a href="">12:22</a> what do you do if you want to stop

I was taking a shit and then saw this

I love the part &quot;why&quot;

“Imagine how bored you have to be”Everyone…

Well what about the other side of the spoon

Wow.. it&#39;s ugly

I love how pewds suck the microphone

Bro that poor fox stuffed animal. It just Drowned in that paint. It even stuck its paw out

<a href="">10:52</a> yes, now I don’t have to light matches on, yes, I know I’m risking to accidentally drop it and burn everything down, I know, but come on, lighting matches on takes about 3 precious seconds of my life so I have to save those 3 seconds.

You know, you can use a spoon the correct way or you can use it backwards. If you use the spoon backwards, you will notice that your cereals are falling, so just grab a hammer and smash the spoon with the hammer so your cereals don’t fall!

Bruh that dude looked at the pad like she was carrying a gun or something 

<a href="">10:50</a>Let me tell you something else to do buy a fricking lighter instead.

You should think about having kids PeWds. I understand it can be fun to shit on them and be dismissive of things considered childish, but having kids really makes everything in life fun again. Instead of patronizing childish ideas you rediscover how amazing it is to recognize innocence.

&quot;SHE MADE A SPOON OUT OF A SPOON&quot; imfrickingdyingIcannot

&quot;more 5 minutes craft this is funny&quot;That&#39;s why their idiot videos gaining popularity

Sydney Opera House, perhaps? the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically past?...&quot;  Mrs Richards: &quot;Don&#39;t be silly!

I just can’t make myself believe that 5 minute crafts isn’t a long running troll. Some (lots) of their stuff seems too self aware to not be ironic. Mark my words, one day they’re going to announce that they‘ve been messing with us the whole time and we’re all stupid for buying it

<a href="">14:23</a> okay just for some extra info to anyone, I&#39;m by sure if I have said this before, but that fox plush that they put into the glue was handmade. I know this because I was looking for a custom made plush to look like my cat, and I found a person who made these kind of things. I actually found the exact person who made that fix plush (I can&#39;t remember the name).The point is was that fox plush was handmade. Some one put in hours of hard work into that plush and 5 minute crafts just absolutely destroyed it.

WHY THE HELL IS SHE DROWNING THAT DOG WTF <a href="">14:25</a>

Ngl the first one is helpful

&quot;He&#39;s putting hot glue in a screw..&quot;HKW DSRE U RHYME HAHA

Dude <a href="">2:07</a> is real Have you ever watch Thai channel that use that taknic to repair the road

The fact that 5 minutes crafts uses the same video in multiple videos lmao, has a misleading/clickbait thumbnail many times to attract people, shows stuff that takes hours to make and calls it 5 minutes crafts, shows trash solutions to stuff which is just bad and names it &quot;DIY&quot;. Most people are clearly not offended and continue to subscribe after all of this, why

The Dislikes are from 5-Minutes Crafts Fans.

Love how Pewds has to hold the mic the whole time

I watched jackass 2 where they did that with pubes <a href="">11:22</a>

Did 5 minutes craft don&#39;t give you copyright strike

Even the girls look unhappy x&#39;DD <a href="">7:01</a>

Pewds always being late to every trend

<a href="">14:00</a> I would genuinely find useful if I was actually stupid enough to leave my wallet in my back pocket

<a href="">14:25</a> holy s at first I thought they were actually putting a dog / fox? Or some kind of animal in there. I was gonna call PETA

but consider this:DI-LWIAY

When you realise this is where Marzia got her inspiration. The furby bong.

<a href="">13:05</a> now we know how spit was born

How high must you be to make a spoon out of a spoon

I hate when I get Parkinson’s and spill my store brand Fanta all over the table

Why didn’t she turn the spoon over like what

<a href="">13:06</a> foreshadowing

PewDiePie: are you fu*king 12?Me: yes 

That monalisa picture is so f hilarious idek why ppl should do that 

When you are talking,its late for like 0.99

<a href="">13:04</a> is that spit?

<a href="">13:04</a> MARZIA CHECK YOUR WHATSAPP

Martzia recently rewatched this video I’m sure.

<a href="">1.05pm</a> Marzia!!?
<a href="">5:31</a> she could have turned it over but she decided to get a hammer and bend the metal just so she can eat the cereal

5 minutes of craft more like 5 of death

That bowl could be sold in a pretentious art gallery for 100k

We watch 5 minute crafts for timepass and to get sleep

<a href="">13:03</a> it all started here

why why why WHY WHY WHY

Yes, but we&#39;ve also noticed that your video and audio are not in sync. Yes, Felix, I noticed.

Imagine going to use your spoon and it just wont work because its flipped lol

hahahahha! it&#39;s funny the brush move with motor hahahahah so funny

Last January, me and my group mates made that brush thing at the start of the video for our SIP(Science Investigatory Project). During the actual report when we were trying to demonstrate the actual product. My classmate accidentally pushed it out of the armchair and it broke, the motor and battery were just scattered there on the ground and since it broke we cant get the grade cause the teacher don&#39;t know if it actually works. I mean, I already know that our product is shit and stupid for believing something that works on the internet most of the times. But to my surprise, we got actually got 98/100 on our SIP. Anyways thanks for reading.

There&#39;s a channel called How To Cook That who debunks fake life hack channels like 5 Minute Crafts. I recommend watching her videos because you&#39;ll learn good stuff from her. 

A few years ago I tried a five minutes craft &quot;craft&quot; and I got a permanent scar on my finger YAY

<a href="">11:25</a>IS THAT PEE PEE HAIR!?!?

the ramen noodle thing is 1005 fake. just fyi. for anyone dumb enough and willing to fuck up their porcelain to try it.

x minute krofts are just scams, but the amount of views that it gets (along with its surrogate channels) it shows that people want scams, need scams to happen to them. They lost their ability to be creative and need stupid things to see ;-)I get that 5% are good things but why would you even continue looking after you see what&#39;s all about? Eh. Idiocracy is near, so, we&#39;ll wait, right?... bruh...

<a href="">13:04</a> Is this what Marzia tried to recreate but created an entity that haunts edgar?

Netflix: are you still watching? Someone&#39;s daughter: <a href="">1:36</a>

My dad came in at the exact monent when felix screamed butt on toilet and made a funny face and said its dinner

is it just me or the video and the audio dosent match? like audio is 1 second faster than the video

Pewds let&#39;s be honest the baked soldiers were kinda cool

Mood ring toilets would be smart to see if <b>anything</b> was <b>anywhere</b> on the toilet

ok, but that toilet kinda cool tho...

WHY?

The razor kettle is a real thing, they used to make those in prison when they needed hot water to cook in their cells, they used to call &#39;em &#39;stingers&#39;, watch Larry Lawton for an extended instruction on how to make one safely because it can blow a fuse in your home if used incorrectly :D
