Can‚Äôt wait for the new one this week

They are hijacking a container truck before now a long tanker truck

again these Indian tales ...

They know they can just rob the truck when the driver is refueling/toilet break/meal break right?

<a href="">3:48</a> gotta love tegos part
Everything wrong with this scene...

1. Hahn&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s biceps buffed up like The Rock&#39;s when she jumped out of the rear window



2. Letty points a liquid nitrogen gun to her face while clipping it on 



3. Why is the gas truck driver in the Dominican Republic a Mexican?  



4. Truck driver doesn&#39;t notice cars skidding next to him and exploding hitches, but Letty catches his eye on &quot;top&quot; of the truck?

This like the only time they ever tried to get gas

This is happening now in 2022  

Thanks for the instructions. Fuel is too expensive in Germany.
Didnt realize this was a Trailer for the year 2022 and the gas price explosion Happening now. Forming a Team for this, anyone in?

I‚Äôm Dominican and I can‚Äôt help but notice that truck driver sounds Mexican asf I thought this was DR

All this extra shit and they could have just shot out the tires of the truck pulling the trailers

Paul and Jordana look great!

Vin and Michelle look great!

Is she Anna Lusia from Lost series??

Wait a minute, is that grand national equipped with turbo??

<a href="">5:17</a> I felt bad for this guy

Does everyone in the Dominican Republic have a pet iguana?

I would get a gun to control the driver of oil truck, easier and safier.

Ain‚Äôt no way a rig would haul that many tanks of gas

OMG

ASDRZCBNM√ñ√á≈û NM√ñJFJUCLƒûWD
People doing that where I live. $2500 for 4 gallons of gas. The end of days has arrived.

Forgive my ignorance ahead of time but what car is Toretto driving?

Superb....................

Break check the truck, wipp out multiple guns on the driver, and borrow the truck.&quot;its that simple&quot;

From which movie did this part had been taken

Man fuck dem!!! Making my gas expensive, I‚Äôm waiting till all the crew dies horrible 

What kind of car is dom driving

Is fuel really worth that debacle? I suppose realism isn&#39;t really the series strong suit.



Watching this as a kid was stunning. Now i cant stop facepalming myself for a second.

Here I am watching this before my driving test.

Iguana

Tengo

This is exactly where physics started failing in the franchise

Why didnt letty just stay on the side of they tanker that they were gonna break off? then she coulda just slowed down with the black truck.

Back when it was ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô

This is a classic scene and in itself deserves an award

I&#39;m glad that Paul and Jordanna reunite.

I hope they plan on sticking together.

They make a good team.

Vin diseal and Michelle had the upper hand.

Pretty intense

Wastage  of gas and money

Vin diesel is boring
Fucking movie culera they exaggerated

Zero chance your doing a j turn with a dually. You would have flipped that truck guaranteed

<a href="">1:14</a> wow

Scenes like this are far more exiting than jumping between buildings. I hope future Fast and Furious movies will be more grounded.

This is an epic scene if you are younger than 15yo

They have all the fast and furious songs but at the same time in all these movies it doesn&#39;t show then ever being hunted by the cops, it shows then doing so many crimes that I am suprising that the FBI doesn&#39;t show up at there doors in the movies every morning.

Thats not a gas truck, if u have seen the movie. It is pure gold

Can i just point out that this got 51 mill views

I love all of the fast and furious movis

They could‚Äôve just made the truck stop and then tie the driver up

Haha Gas is No More GOLD Now !!!!!

Why doesn&#39;t Letty hold on to the front of trailer that they&#39;re about to steal instead of holding onto the one attached to the driver? lol

Mine blowing...

Get this PlayStation 3 graphics sh*t outta here LMAOOOOTo add, a complete disregard of the laws of Physics has been going on for some time lol

Isn‚Äôt so much better during the last gas when letty lost her hammer she spray the hitch then hold onto something tight in the other side that they had already stolen?

Yes
Best movie of all time
Let me watch. The movie has been liked more than 3 times
The driver jumped out without a problem while Letty having some trust issues

Is this why oil price went up that year... OMG, I hate you guys

Would it have not been easier to just put a Stinger down to deflate the truck tyres and then steal it!?

Insane

Just remember if vin petrol can be a hero then you can be anything anyone.

Its simple in real rob the truck driver

hello, who are you?
Are there Arabs?
but oil price is so low right now...

Well they couldn&#39;t have strangled that driver and looted the gas.... That would be so much easier to do but now Hollywood have to do something crazy

stealing gas ? fuck that !!! low level criminals

Why didn&#39;t all those trailers not have dual wheels to handle the weight that was in the tanks. Also the brakes should have locked up when the air lines came uncoupled?

When I look at this now I think how stupid. They use such expensive cars for the hiest. Just stop the truck, show a gun and take the truck. Then the driver jumps out so easily and Letty cannot jump off the back. Plus they end up destroying a tank or 2 and nearly kill the driver.

It&#39;s a great movie

Vin diesel stealing another fuel hilarious

Fast and Furious died with Paul Walker
how was he going to make that turn with all trailers, to fake for me

Why didn&#39;t they  stop the truck driver at the gun point in the first place and then loot the oil??? Would have saved them a lot of trouble  and unnecessary heroic actions

..

This is not possible  idiot.All people have brains idiot.

i like this movie very much
Why can&#39;t they just ask the driver to pull over for some help, and then steal the gas simply

The main enemy of the People's Republic of China
Was that cheeche Marin as the trucker?

Good 
All gorgeous Expandables! A damn good cast, a touch of magical explosions, fun fight sequences and a nice moral of loyalty between friends like &lt;&lt; you fuck me: I fuck you. &gt;&gt;
Vin Diesel hits diesel

Vin Diesel is so American. He is always after the oil

Yeah the the movies was always about racing Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èYeah right

Somebody is gonna get laid, with full gas.

Check Best Hollywood hind dubbed film 2019<a href="">

The most amazing movie I've ever seen
Dom yeets under the truck, so crazy

<a href="">

Rip Paul Walker

Funny that in the first film, Dom and his crew were unable to take out the truck with the driver with a shotgun. But in this film, they were able to take out the gas fuel truck with the driver with a revolver and his pet iguana. I liked this film better than the first in my opinion.

Jajajajaja

When Fast and Furious was about cars , women , roads and family

Liars. A trashy Indian movie
Why do the effects look so shit?

Did that whole movie cost $20 looked like they just made everything with the computer what did these so called actors even Do?

So they turned to incest I thought he was only gay

Was there a reason the truck guy decided to keep speeding while going down the hill? I mean, its his life vs some petrol. What idiot would risk their life for petrol?

What happens when gas hits 5$ a gallon.

Overly convoluted and complex bullshit. You pull the truck over, pay off the driver, and drive away with the whole thing.... The driver doesn&#39;t OWN the fucking trailers.

I love this badass letty:(

how stupid can they be ? just kill that driver and get everything !          TOTAL NON-SENSE

PLOT FAILED: The truck was driving to a dead end road all the way. No diversion nothing straight one way to dead end. If he didn&#39;t know than why he was going that way to deliver at the first place?

Dope

Han&quot;s orange pickup is legendary

Hooked

What a joke. There was only one man in the truck. They can made the truck stop and could do there task easily. Foolish scene.

Yes xo x stealing petrol he tried to kill a poor truck driver who was doing his job... he's not great he's a murderer. As long as he plays the role of the borderline reckless driver with the law who is hired by the secret services I can have sympathy for him... but in this case he repelled me
Cooooollll

I never seen a Truck with 6 Tanks 

Now let us see them do this without using Green Screen &amp; CGI.

O kind, be kind to us, O Lord
I never got why the truck driver jumped out

Is gas really worth that much in the DR?

What are you doing? Kidnapping the driver.

What car is dom driving

Last seen was fired...

butiful gils
Dom Dom‚Äã Dom

Someone should make this into a gigantic roller-coaster/car track ride. Better yet, make a bunch of the badass scenes out of the movies into legitimate badass reenactment rides. Fast and Furious Land. Ah the stoned ideas I have.

Wooooooooooow!! Vin diesel 
Cc tui may
So dom is weak and gay

I love all the fast and furious movies

These Fast 4 scene is like a climax orgasm, the best ever on sequel. After Paul Walker died &amp; DJ take it to another level, their storyline was moving away from car races...so dissapointed.

Reverse gears don‚Äôt go this fast. Same as Dom and Brian‚Äôs race.

game

Couldnt they just pull over the guy and knock him out or sum so extra

CGI was rubbish back then!

Xxx riteune muvpllz
Meaning less....They can deal with the driver

For doing this they can1.Stop the truck by some acting that they got injured and they can beat the driver and could take over it2. Show the gun and make him to get out of itand there are more plans. By making the above plan executed they could get 6 containers without any damage...!

Couldn&#39;t dom have just driven round the corner instead of driving under the flaming tank of fuel

Please tell me what movie is this?
The truck guy saved his little friend

Isn't it too cool?
Why?

You could have killed the driver

They could&#39;ve hijack it instead, did they really think the driver would never notice and after all the effort the truck driver yet he gives it up by jumping.

The best FAF intro to this day man 

Dom!!!! I like it
Ani deya mzak ae..!!

Why not put a 4 in that title? Or call it &quot;Fast and 4-ious?&quot;

The No. 1 movie that makes you nervous even though it's the opening scene
Vin Diesel needs fuel to move or he just stops.

Idiots...  Kill the truck driver and all yours... Why to do these shit

Music name at the end?

Wasn&#39;t this looking like gta v

ye behen key laudey krkey kya rhey the ?

Y can&#39;t they just kill the driver and take all gas instead of going for badass action...

Have they heard of ARCO gas pretty cheap there ? Really putting your life for Diesel? Lame lame lame

Hi

Anyone else here who thought they seen every fast and furious

or just put a gun in his head and do it more safelyÔ∏è

They need to go back to doing these heists using Honda&#39;s .All that extra torque,  is just not needed

What the fuck was that..‚ÄçÔ∏è if they want to steal gas only, why they didn‚Äôt steal the whole lorry by killing that stupid driver.. unnecessarily they waste two tanks as well as an expensive lorry 

The thing that I like about these movies is how they use kiddish teamwork

Smart ass buick grand national

When Fast &amp; Furious used to be  Fast &amp; Furious.

The lizard didn&#39;t ask for all this

Movie for&#39; landmark and a unique surrealism... I prefer science fiction ones that contain very little fiction in their plots. Interdimensional travel is more feasible than watching some idiots carry out a possible tanker robbery in full swing like that. Ha ha
they were alot and the driver was alone, they would arrest him or hold a gun on his head rather destroying the truck.. they could loot the truck easily, couldn&#39;t they?

SO MUCH SHIT FOR A ROBBERY, MAKE A FUCKING STOP AND THAT'S IT
i seen every single movie except the fate of the furious it seems boring i only liked the end where the baby pointed its finger at the sky basicly telling us paul walker is in the sky rest in peace

2018 were driving fararis and lambos here meh ran

Dom DomDom

If the truck driver can jump into the road nice n safely, why didn&#39;t Letty just do the same? Ow i get it, it would be less intense, less action.

Quick question is Han&#39;s dating another girl what happened to Gisele huh im confused on this one what number is this movie and i gotta say han and Gisele look cute as a couple no joke

why the gas tank bounce a lot<a href="">6:17</a>

This clip:Wouldn&#39;t it have been easier to cause a small accident. Where both parties come to a stop to exchange details...then rob him.....that would have been better option that this 15min episode .....just a thought!!!!!

Funny how Dom almost kills himself and his girlfriend by drifting under the bouncing and nearly exploded tank the idiot slowed down and with that almost successfully crushed both of them

When fast and furious make good movies

Why not follow the truck until it stops Because fast that&#39;s why

Good movie. But there are very few details I like to point out that offends realists. But right now I&#39;m tired.

I&#39;m getting this thought... Actually we guys are admiring something that&#39;s not even right... They&#39;re stealing something and we guys are liking it...Where are we leading to... Even though they&#39;re the heroes its not ok to admire them...If the heroes are stealing something from an culprit or like stopping an illegal activity(like the next parts of f&amp;f)...That should be admirable but not this one

That truck is definitely in violation of DOT standards

Superb

Dont remember this scene

At least the iguana is ok

Dominic Toretto in Dominican RepublicVin Diesel stealing Diesel
Instead of doing soo much for gas,they could have just beat the truck driver and steal the truck away.

The truck driver is the hero in this scene, he was only trying to defend himself from thieves, and he didn‚Äôt leave his pet iguana behind.

Beautiful
She could have just knocked that trick driver with that hammer and rob the whole thing?

This is when the series start to dying. Also stole the fuck truck  don¬¥t need all this for gas.

Film Good 
<a href="">6:17</a> is she lerning hes name ??

Best Ever Scene ...
Who are you seeing from Bangladesh??
What is it with jumping off cars to other cars or just ditching your car by jumping off

Logic rip
I&#39;m not a huge Grand National fan but it looks like this one took a beating I hope it wasn&#39;t a real one and from the fender Vents it might have been a GNX and people are paying stupid money for those today

They couldn&#39;t just take over the truck. It&#39;s just one guy. Anyway looks cool the dangerous way

I love you vin desel

That just looks like GTA

What car is that Doms

Yes he is dom..

Lie.bomm drive, OK

AMAZING!!!

I&#39;ve wanted a black Monte Carlo since this scene.

Why don&#39;t these guys just shoot the truck driver and get it done with? Oh wait, these guys are morally righteous criminals.

The moment the chain broke, the truck would speed up suddenly and hits Dom&#39;s car.
