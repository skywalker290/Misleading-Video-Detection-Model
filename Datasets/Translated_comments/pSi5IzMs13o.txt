To the us Canada meme… look at Canada’s booty hole 

I get scared when the car lights are turned on because people can see me. Same fear w/ playing horror games, even if it isn&#39;t part of the mechanics, I turn off my flashlight so monsters won&#39;t see me

Is Felix really THIS stupid? The reason you don&#39;t want a light shining in your face is pretty self explanatory, especially when driving when its dark.

<a href="">9:08</a> in my experience some cars have brighter back lights than others, so it can be distracting as the driver when looking through the rear view mirror. Think of it light shining a flashlight just above your eyes and trying to focus on what’s in front of you I guess.

No. It’s the glare in the window. If I use the rear view mirror in complete darkness I can’t see.

The interior car lights thing is a three part problem. The reason it used to be such a problem was because windshields used to be flatter and the interior decor used to be brighter, causing a lot of reflection off of the windshield, making it difficult to see where you were going. The second part is a battery issue. If it was left on all day, they could drain the battery due to older cars not being as energy efficient as newer ones. The third issue is that it makes your surroundings difficult to see. If the light is on inside the car, your eyes adjust and you can&#39;t see outside very well because of reflections of the inside of the car and your eyes not being adjusted to the dark.

My parents always told me not to leave the lights in the car on at night because it made seeing into the darkness more difficult, and the driving less safe. Now I want to check and see if that is even true ha

The light in the car thing... My parents told me that light gets reflected on wind shield and blocks view during night. And I believed it.

I&#39;ve seen the happy wheels episode...IT&#39;S EPIC!!! (I guess) lol

Lmao, like what happened to Mass Effect Andromeda, hate just to hate. The game wasn&#39;t perfect but let&#39;s admit it, it wasn&#39;t as trash as anything people suggested. I enjoyed the game. There was a couple glitch and a bit of lack of content at the end, but it was still great and enjoyable.

I dont think people called the guy out  who couldt write &#39;loading&#39; because some people is word blind, and no matter what people say. Pewdiepie was a but mean there. Dont come with dumb comments, im just making him know, even tho its a lo g time since.

Time Before Hell

The reason people turn of the light in the car is because it wastes electricity, so you have to restart the car with a separate battery.

Poggers for God..,,..

Reddit is not deviant art

<a href="">18:44</a> classic frame! Classic!

yesterday i was watching a video where he couldn&#39;t remember where that shot with the glowing hand was from. and today youtube recommends me the answer.

Mid90s by Jonah Hill was a great movie on Netflix Felix has good taste

dude saying who plays Animal Crossing is a gamer smh

Thanks YouTube for just suggesting this video

lol he thinks people on Reddit have friends

As everyone Australia says eshayyyyyyyy
<a href="">16:29</a> the 7 minutes goes to 8 when he upvotes

Saying video games cause violence is like saying &quot;car toys cause car crashes&quot;

The thing with the light in the back: In some Cars it blinds the driver most of the time when looking in the rear view mirror. It worsens nightview and its annoying.

The car light thing is that and the fact that by the next day the light drains the battery and your car is dead when your about to leave for work. I also remember my mom saying she didn’t want other people to be able to see into the car with just her and kids

Damn, rewatching some lwiay, and completely forgot the context of that gold hand clip thats in the new intro

Pewds sayin drunk driving before skateboard accidents like drunk driving is worse than falling on your skateboard. Bro.

<a href="">0:35</a> I don’t have 8 friends

I found the glowing hand XD

I think the light thing is just because the light reflects and the driver can&#39;t see.

The amount of god damn quotes in this comment section is fucking staggering

My parents said that the car lights distract the car behind us. Did anyone else’s say this?

<a href="">9:29</a> ngl it&#39;s a distraction when driving late at night.  I think it&#39;s a car or somthin&#39;...nope just my niece or nephew in the backseat...

There&#39;s a totally good reason not to turn on lights in a car while driving, if it&#39;s dark out you won&#39;t be able to see the outside as well if there&#39;s lights inside the car, my parents told me the reason when they told me not to do it, so I&#39;ve always known. You can&#39;t be driving when all you see in the window is your own reflection, you need to see the road.

Or maybe the glare is on the windshield and they can tsee

PewDiePie: everywhere I go I see his face

No pewds. The light causes glare on the wind shield at night

The light are so people driving can see better in the dark

And this was his last video before hell happened.

how is it physically impossible to be faster than light? We already have objects in our universe that travel FTL. Speed is relative and depends from where it is measured. The whole &quot;the faster something is the more mass it gains&quot; makes no sense. Because we have whole galaxies move at near FTL already, which would make no sense as those would need to have already become black holes by that logic. In fact our own galaxy probably would have to as well, at least from the perspective of those galaxies.

Ttht44wc vdqa  aAwcc

<a href="">9:20</a> I think it also might be because when it’s dark outside it’s a little bit of a distraction? Like when you go from a dark room to outside and can’t see anything because your eyes haven’t adjusted. If you look into the light then back at the road you might have temporary vision impairment. Just don’t look into the light tho like come on 

<a href="">0:00</a> watch it in 2xWelcome to the Fap Cap Army

It is Jojo not full metal alchemist <b>*screams in pain*</b>

it is illegal to drive with your interior light on... in Australia at least.

Someone&#39;s failing at censoring words long enough on the vid

<a href="">17:35</a> yall
<a href="">1:50</a> And he just announced that he is retired

nice clickbait, it was good because i actually clicked it

“...ok I take it back, this person is right” LMAO

Its called being night blind, it also happens when there are lights mounted on the roof at it reflects off the hood, which actually lessens your vision. This happens because your eyes get adjusted to the light, so it is harder to see things in the dark

Wow I got a mr beast ad on the cornament

I haven&#39;t thought about it much But pewds is going to retire one day.

my dad said to turn off the light because it glares on the window causing it to be harder to see out the windows

this is the day before the first corona case...so much should have been differently done

Communism

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Me looking back at this vid seeing of how excited we were for this year like 

Pewdiepie videos are a blur now
Kpop stans on twitter need to hear what Pewds said here, the &#39;always complaining&#39; fans are also in his fandom. Since we don&#39;t know what our Idols think, we should take heed of what he&#39;s saying. He&#39;s got more experience and an be trusted though these are very different fandoms

Can we just know something, Felix? Why is it always Full metal Alchemist?

Hmmm the pic in the thumbnail looks like a melon..... coincidence? I think not

rewind the decade because 2020 sucks

The reason why u don’t turn on the light in the car is that when it is dark it is harder to look outside if it is light inside. 

For the light thing I was told because the light reflects onto the window and is a distraction

<a href="">0:02</a>You burpI fartAnd that&#39;s just art

<a href="">9:21</a> Dunno if he&#39;s just fucking with us and I simply got wooshed , but whenever you turn on the lights especially in the back it causes glare on the wind shield especially at night  which makes it hard to see the road

Why does peers become the terminator at <a href="">18:20</a>

The most EPIC episode of LWIAY EVER!!!

parents taught me don&#39;t turn on light so ppl can&#39;t see inside the car and what the ppl in the car are doing

the old intro sounds tripy now

What edition do you have of aoe

no felix the car lights inside refpect off the windshield and it can make it hard for the driver to see outside

if Life is a video game, It was written by Neil Druckmann and I want a bloody refund.

<a href="">8:03</a> simple it goes through

I was watching this and I got a Pewdiepie add.

I didn&#39;t know MrBeast&#39;s full name is Jimmy Donaldson

&quot;its last lwiay of the decade&quot; no thats not true 2020 is also 202nd decade

Yo mama

PEWDIEPIE PHONE CASE EPICO

the car light thing is cause if its dark outside the light can get reflected in the glas so that the driver cand see anything so you could literally die

best intro yet
The good old &quot;leave your entries in the subreddit Bros and I&#39;ll watch submissions in the next episode of lwiay&quot; days 

<a href="">18:06</a>I get pewds was being sarcastic but it&#39;s mildly infuriating

I’m so glad that the og lwiay is back

And also on the way you go t to drunk and be alone if that&#39;s whar tounwamt A, rto

You dont leave the lights on because in the night the battery dies, how tf am I the One saying this

HE PREDICTED THE ME TOO MOVEMENT FOR NETFLIX 
Why can no say stonk but stionk

If you turn on the light in the car when its dark the windows reflect the inside of the car making it hard to see out; it also cocks up your &quot;night vision&quot;

The reason you turn off the lights is because it can destract other drivers. <a href="">9:00</a>

Best intro of LWIAY yet

Having lights on at night in the car make the windshield slightly reflective making it harder to see

how did felix get brad to wear the dress haha

Wait that’s the old intro it’s been this long

Lol......why???????

This is 2 days before 2020We were so naive

Is math related to science?

I thought if that light was on you can’t see in the  rear view mirror

The reason you shouldn’t turn on car lights at night is because it makes it harder for the driver to see in the dark as your eyes have adjusted to light, and the light can distract other drivers because it stands out :)

It&#39;d be harder to make 8 friends than it would be to buy 8 routers

I feel like hus subreddit should be art and fan-edits/compilations/videos but also have some PewDiePie and/or game-related meme. Things that can be generally associated with Felix. That&#39;s at least what I think the subreddit should&#39;ve been...

<a href="">9:20</a> its because of the reflection of the light in the windscreen, at night it can be really difficult to see

Rewind this decade? You mean REPLAY this decade? Well, I guess unless you mean rewind and rewatch? I dunno bruh...you be you . You did good . Don’t let your dad tell you otherwise . Unless you don’t have....dada? 

the car light way annoying for a driver. You can see better in the dark when there are no light around you

Real reason for the lights is that during an emergency, ur eyes will be prepared for darkness, if they are turned off lmao. Same in planes during the landing.

I swear pewds could watch naruto and say is this full metal alchemist ?

A yes, a video before 2020 just started.

Hi

This is the last time Pewds liked Felix.

That&#39;s Ed&#39;s brother not a robot, you monster

<a href="">12:53</a> so many things wrong with that meme

<a href="">2:56</a> what song was that

What do you mean i’m kidding

Pewds channel is younger then me

night driving when you got the dome light on obstructs your vision out the windshield, and is the most annoying thing on the planet. legitimately enough to make me contemplate dropping you off in the middle of nowhere and just leaving you there. probably not going to do it, cause I am not that guy. that said, just know, I have a searing anger towards you that will never subside.

for the i cant sleep the ngl it took me like 7 seconds

<a href="">9:40</a> PLS UPVOTE TO GET THIS MEME MAN INTO MEME REVIEW PLS

i think the reason why you should keep the indoor car light off is cause it can blind the drivers vision by shining onto the windshield.

A lots happened in just 6 months.

So felix and pewdiepie used to be in good terms. I wonder what happened that made pewdiepie so mad with felix now

What&#39;s crazy is loading and loding are both pronounced the same way so he was technical right in his way

&quot;That&#39;s why I dont like big cities because idk&quot;

The inside car light shines in the mirror and messes up the drivers view

that edit definitely made me cry a lil i freakin love you pewdsits been amazing having you to watch throughout my whole life

shout out physicists

Actually they turn the light off because if child leave it on, it kill car battery in a day or so.

It&#39;s because the car light wastes energy when you leave it on

pewds why.

What happened in the past 5 months , you really liked felix in this video but now you two dont seem to get along very well :(

i liked this video it was funny (: happy comment gang (:

its an issue because when its dark outside and its light inside its hard to see out the windshield sometimes and it can cause an accident. thats what they taught me when i was studying for my licence

Its JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO JOJO ADVENTURE

This dude has changed all of our lives. Like an internet dad. Damn

The issues is when kids leave the lights on during the night or for long periods of time and kill the cars battery

Wait but I’m 14

my mom didn&#39;t want the light inside the car to be on because it makes it harder to see out the window when its dark outside

You dont turn on the lights cuz the lights make a reflaction of the inside on the window so the driver doesnt see the road

Is driving with your interior lights on illegal? We&#39;re going to put this one in the large file called Dad Myths. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a fine on the books for doing it, and the whole idea of &quot;map lights&quot; is that someone in the passenger seat might need to use them while you&#39;re driving, although less so in the sat nav era.The main interior light is also handy for finding out just how far your son or daughter has stuck that jelly bean up their nose so you know whether you need to pull over. But the fact is, it&#39;s very annoying to the driver to operate a vehicle at night while they&#39;re on, which is why just about every Dad, ever, has said at some stage or other &quot;Turn those bloody lights off, it&#39;s illegal you know!&quot;While a specific fine isn&#39;t listed on the RTA&#39;s informative list of things you can be booked for, we reckon a police officer with initiative could still find some way to slap you for it, because the fact is it does create unnecessary and unsafe reflection on the windscreen, and driving with interior lights on is thus best kept to a minimum.

The subreddit needs to be more like in the earlydays when you said that we have to do something for the next week everyone can than shoose to particepate or post a meme about you.

Im pretty sure at night its either harder to see outside because the inside light is on, but also the front windshield reflects the light furthermore its even harder to see than before

Lol it's dr nefarious

In older cars if you leave the light on it can kill the battery

Pewds the light must stay off in cities because of all of the light and lampposts that might look like it in the reflection of a mirror or window and cause a car crash

chair gangCringe 
If the light is on you won&#39;t be able to see with your rearview mirror

The reason why putting the inside car light on is dangerous, is because the driver will have more difficulty seeing outside since his surronding is illuminated.

On his thumbnail he kinda looks like scarce Lol

@<a href="">8:42</a> - When our parents drove through a long tunnel/it turned night, the back seat became pitch black. (At no other time are children expected to sit silently in complete darkness with their family,) so we instinctively clicked on the ceiling light. Parents suddenly couldn&#39;t see the road, (because the interior reflections on the windshield became brighter than the road [lit by headlights].) &quot;You&#39;re going to get us killed! Turn that light off!&quot; I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m Typing this.

Crows???

Lmfao the rewind dude managed to slip the bridge clip in there and still get a big pp rating

Bruh why that dude with the edit throughout the decade put the n-word clip come on bruh

Pewds

The reason the light is annoying is because of the glare on glasses. For my dad&#39;s car, if I left the light on, it would reflect off the window and onto his glasses. He&#39;d tell me to turn it off because of that.

When pewds says &#39;when i retire,&#39; does that mean he wont make anymore vids :(

Hey I fixed it.  PEWBS

i play pixelings

We dont open the light in the car at late hours , bc is brighter than the road ahead and the driver see the reflection of the kids

mid 90s is a skateboarding movie not about living in the 90s about skating in the 90s

If the light is on at night it&#39;s hard for the driver to see sometimes

PewDiePie : Welcome to LWIAYAuto Generated Subtitles : Welcome to HAWAII

my dad said to not turn on the light because it was hard to the road

we used to have an old car where if you left the light on, the car battery would die xD don&#39;t ask me how, but that&#39;s how I learned NOT to turn that light on longer than necessary ^^&#39;

Its jojo
<a href="">9:15</a> my mom always just said it was distracting to the driver

Dude did he just call jojo a full metal alchemist reference

Pewds: calls jojo full metal alchemist Me a jojo fan: aren’t you supposed to know anime?

In many ways, math is closely related to science. Mathematics is a scholarly domain, and so the mathematical community works as the scientific community does — mathematicians build on each other&#39;s work and behave in ways that push the discipline forward. This progress contributes to scientific breakthroughs. totally not what google said.

its becuase if its dark outside you cant see shit if there is light in the car

I love the intro of LWIAY PewDiePie

Hello people I would like to inform u that wasn’t fullmetal alchemist it was Jojo bizarre adventure

<a href="">8:32</a> prob going Mach 2 lol
Did you guys here bout the new gfuel cup

PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then

Thanks satan
GRETA IS SWEDISH NANI

Pewds you should try to spell loading

I’m not 9 anymore 

If you leave the light on in old cars the battery will still run and then die and you’ll have to jump start the car

<a href="">8:02</a> ITS NOT INFINITE THERES A BORDER SMALL PP

how about a nostalgic let&#39;s play from Age of Empires? still love that game :&#39;D

The reason that people say not to turn off the light in the car is it for some reason people believe that it&#39;ll affect the light coming from the headlights of the car when you&#39;re on the road it&#39;s stupid

If there is a person of the year there should be every single person in a year long ranking vid

<a href="">14:10</a> “I don’t know who that is” sad Gru noises

<a href="">3:10</a> what’s that game

Pewpew you are still a millenial yes downvote me i would rather have small pp because I&#39;m a pretty girl and 1 year older than felix and proudly millenial also my man has big pp MuwHahhahaha

My name is Kharma, so every time he says karmawhore, I’m a bit hurt.

What if you don’t have 8 friends

whats the song at <a href="">2:54</a>

ik why they dont let is turn on the lights its because it uses nore gasoline

My mom said when the light’s on and she’s driving it adds glare and it’s a distraction which I understand (night driving obvi cause there’s not really a point for the light in the day)

The issue is that it is harder to see out of your windshield at night whenever the inside of your car is lit up.

Pewdipie: The power of my standAlso Pewdiepie: Nice! Full metal alchemist

<b>21 february arrives</b>pewds:Allow me to introduce my self again

pewds it you you
Why did u burp

Come back felix
<a href="">8:48</a> why my mom didn&#39;t let us turn on the lights is because, my mom said that children get kidnapped and cops mainly go for cars that have their light on inside the car because most kidnappers have that light as an indication for some odd reason, i dunno that&#39;s just what my mom said.

The main thing is, people need to think for themselves.

Who is Russian?)
Yet other sub Reddit’s make fun of the shit from that sub

104, 52x2 = 2 year anniversary of LWIAY

i’m 19 and i died at the 19 year olds meme with the cat 

the reason why people get mad when you turn them on at night is because it reflects off the windshield and could cause the driver to get into an accident.

Did you see that the I cant sleep meme kinda looked like vy&#39;s secret message bag

To be fair, r/pewdz is pretty shit. Highlights are great but it isn&#39;t something to join or keep an eye on. And besides that it completely screws up your feed.

<a href="">9:26</a> No it is because your iris will expand and not be able to see the dark road and you will end up crashing

Doesn’t know who dr nefario is.....dear god

The thing with the light is that it&#39;s easier to see the outside road at night if your sitting in a completely dark car instead of having a light inside your car.Since out parents dont see that well due to the age they want it shut off to see better

r/PewDiePieSubmissions is kinda shit tho. All the memes are cringe, low effort, and old. Its full of serial reposters, liars, and karmawhores. I don&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve seen anything that is somewhat good. You can find the occasional decent post but almost all the posts are terrible.

Who wants to start a GoFundMe for PewDiePie to buy a trebuchet?

i want another episode of LWIAY

What does lwiay mean?

Fun fact: the reason (maybe) you can&#39;t turn the light on for too long is because it would make a reflection on the rear window of the car, making the rear part of the car a blind spot for the driver.

I thought parents didn&#39;t like the light being left on because it drains the car battery.

53

Is math related to science?   
wait a hot second..putting the light on in the front of the car is legal?

My mom just told me that leaving that car light on while driving was going to get her ticketed.

<a href="">2:48</a> PLEASE what song is this?!i saw the video on reddit an it didn&#39;t have this amazing song ;~;

The reason why I couldn&#39;t turn the car light on was mostly because dad had it hard to see when we drove when it was dark. That&#39;s my experience :P

I got told the car light thing was bad cause of the glare and its hard for the driver behind to see in the dark so now idk if its true or not still

<a href="">9:44</a> He became Smeagol xD

You should change lwiay to pp review

i love bootypie, his video make goo me feel cummyy

if you ever go to NYC try doing a 5 minute spot at the cellar

You don&#39;t get to see the cars behind if the light is turned on using the rear view mirror, especially the ones with dim headlights.

I wrote up my homework and referenced memes, and mentioned pp review and how you rate memes. She went on 10 minute talk on boomers, wasting class time.<b>i’ve won, but at what cost?</b>

For us here in the Philippines, we rather have lights off inside the car to prevent assassination especially when one of your family member is involved in politics.

<a href="">9:10</a> what the hell are you talking about pewds?

can someone tell me how to make custom reddit theme (like PewDiePie&#39;s Downvote and Upvote button)? please

the car light thing is because if there&#39;s more light inside than outside, the windows reflect and you can&#39;t see the road that well anymore

<a href="">15:37</a> 2013 called. They want this Hetalia meme back

Best intro 
I was told the reason why they hate turning the lights on is because it distracts the person driving behind you which I think is bull cuz you can’t see shit in some people’s windows

The reason you dont turn on the light in the car while driving is because you can impair or blind other drivers with the light or causing distractions leading up t o a crash

when the light is on and its dark, the drivers vision is impared, therefore more likely to friggin die

lmao im watching this on my nintendo 2ds get on my level [not even joking]

Some people have issues with night blindness and astigmatisms that make it so they can&#39;t see out of the car with the lights on. Very common with age, especially with women who have been pregnant.

you dont turn the light on in the car cause it glares in the windscreen? s:

For the light, when it&#39;s on it can be hard to see what&#39;s in the rearview mirror.

is Felix and Davie related or something?

He is just trolling the fans at this point about the JoJo memes and referring to them as FMA it is written in the title of the post . GODDAMN i was triggered lol

pewdiepie has smol pp for not knowing the sauce

Karmawhoring:asking begging for upvotes. Example:upvote or hate pewdiepie stuff like that

we need pewdiepie jr.
Felix. I asume Sweden have the same trafic laws as Denmark. It is ilegal to drive with the cabin lights turned on when it is dark outside, reason is driver in the car cant see as clear due to the light going into the purpils and makes them smaller when the driver needs to have larger purpils to see in the dark outside, its like a camera rly. also other drivers that drives towards you can get confused by the cabin lights. The fine in Denmark is 1500DKK.

Pew die pie is gonna retire one day
me looking forward to scrolling down the comments to see all the JoJo fans get triggered xD

<a href="">9:32</a> my dad said it distracted him from the road, but don’t know

Nope when it&#39;s dak outside the car and you mut the light inside the car on you create a mirror effect. When that happens you can&#39;t see or hardly see what&#39;s outside the car but it&#39;s not illegal just dangerous or so my dad said

No way i just remembered I’m actually 19 year old

It&#39;s easier to buy 8 routers than having 8 friends :)

sorry pewds but the real reason why people were thought not do put on car lights is because people can&#39;t see the outside when its dark outside en light inside.

Why the frick is crankthatfrank&#39;s REEEEE there in the video for PewDiePie&#39;s subreddit?

At night the light inside the car reflects off the windshield and makes it more difficult to see outside.

Who is seeing this video on 2020

<a href="">09:05</a>  It&#39;s an issue because it hurts your dark adaption.Seeing in low-light conditions is accomplished via the rod cells in your retina.  They require a pigment called rhodopsin, which is destroyed when hit by light.  It also requires plentiful beta carotene as a precursor chemical, which is why eating carrots (rich in beta carotene) is beneficial to night vision.  No, it&#39;s not a myth - the idea that carrots don&#39;t help vision is the myth.It takes about half an hour for your eyes to reach rhodopsin saturation, where your night vision is at its best.  When you turn on the cabin light inside a car, you are destroying rhodopsin at an increased rate.  You are making your night vision worse, which makes you a worse driver at night.That&#39;s why all sensible people do not leave the cabin lights on while driving at night, whether they are aware of these facts or not.

Have you heard of deformed pikachu? The smash bros. Glitch?

<a href="">18:07</a> pewds getting it right yet wrong...

Could you please play Age Of Empires?

Karma horing is my favorite

Pewds, you dummy. The reason you turn off your interior lights, is because it makes it more difficult to see outside of the car.

That’s the guys from despicable me

Felix, the &quot;don&#39;t turn on the car light&quot; thing is about the light leaving a reflection on the windshield when driving. That reflection can distract the driver or obscure something on the road, that&#39;s why our dads usually told us not to play with it during road trips and so on. I mean, come on now, I thought everybody after a certain age realizes this, especially after they had driven at night even once in their lifetime

PP REVIEW

When the lights are on in the car, that light fills your eyes too and make it more difficult to focus on the lights outside, the headlights of the cars on the other side of the road or the brakelights of people in front of you. So yes, please don’t keep them on if you’re the passenger, more courteous for the driver to turn them off.

“Death stage, can’t wait” Aaaaaand we’re back to dank and edgy teen stage

“Ask all your friends to hotspot”Bold of you to assume I have friends

for the lights tho...its cuz it reflects in the mirror and it blocks the vie from the back , so u cant see if theres a car behind or if it is u cant see the lights when they wanna change lanes or smth , at least for me i cant see em if theres a light turned on XD idk

When the netflix just shooting my shot tweet came up I instantly had the Divine song &quot;shoot your shot&quot; in my head

The reason why people tell their kids to turn off the light in the car is because when you drive at night the light in the car will mess with your natural night vision and you wont be able to see the road clearly for a short while. As for day time? Dunno

nice

you are not suppose to turn on the light in the back becuase it gonna reflect in the front glass of the car so the driver doesent see a shit and youre gonna crash:)

The dome lights being on make it so you can&#39;t see through your rear view mirror.

It&#39;s true, from the wikipedia page for Grumman F-11 Tiger &quot;The F-11 Tiger is noted for being the first jet aircraft to shoot itself down. On 21 September 1956, during a test-firing of its 20 mm (.79 in) cannons, pilot Tom Attridge fired two bursts midway through a shallow dive. As the trajectory of the cannon rounds decayed, they ultimately crossed paths with the Tiger as it continued its descent, disabling it and forcing Attridge to crash-land the aircraft; he survived.&quot;

Pewds won’t respond to this comment

The fact that there are 5 number spaces (#00104) means that pewds will probably do this for VEEEEEEEEEERY long

Wait...  Does pewds have a car license?

Wait, does the number in the title means that he will do at least 10,000 of these? Jeeva leeva

You can&#39;t leave the light on in the car because it is tell  the  person behind you  to watch out because you are looking for something

<a href="">9:44</a> wasn&#39;t expecting that voice lol

<a href="">18:00</a> did he realy fck thougth that was fma ? i mean im just not sure if that is just an uninformed pewds or if its sarcastic

reddtyum

Actually, the interior lights in the car are not supposed to be on, because they make reflections of the interior in the windows, which could potentially block the drivers view, and could be dangerous. You&#39;re welcome.

<a href="">6:54</a> Good job on the censoring.

Hi pew 
Loding is still pronounced Loading.  Like a Lode.

My parents never washed the windshields so turning on the light made it really hard to see the road.

Love ur vids smmmm

Turning on your car lights inside the car, when it&#39;s dark, can severely mess up peoples(boomers) &quot;night vision&quot;It&#39;s like when you walk inside a dark house after being out in the sun. A lot of people can lose their night vision focus from having the lights turned on in their face.

HI THERE !!!!!!!!!!!

“the pp is inconclusive”

Pewds: drinking, doing drugs, drink driving, accidents on skateboardsMe: one of these things is not like the other.

<a href="">9:07</a>I think it&#39;s because our eyes adjust to the light inside and then it is harder to see outside.

<a href="">4:23</a>watched cats on my *birthday*.... I need a hug️

the light can cause glare on the windshield and stop you from being able to see out  eg wait til its dark open your curtains/blinds and turn on your lights and try looking out your window youll see yourself now apply it to your car  same result

my little brother doesnt play video games and he still wants to shoot up his school

Pewds. If you u leave the car light on it runs the battery flat

bruh like im confused wheres minecraft if your bored with vanilla then play modded

felix haven't you seen Dumb Mej?
the car light thing is also because when you drive in the dark you dont want a lot of light in the car since it makes it harder to see the darkness

Somebody explain pewds how car batteries work

The light being on is a problem because it&#39;s a visual distraction for the driver

The person who posted the cats meme stole it off my post on r/memes :(

“People in London are so rude.”Well Felix you are a foreigner so you should’ve expected that.

<a href="">9:43</a> why did press have to get all meatball on us

You cant see in the mirror if the light is on

Pewds

you&#39;re not supposed to turn the lights on at night because it can cause a reflection on the windows

my parents say not to turn on the light because they might think. there is a car behind us. But they never said it was illegal

The lights are illegal cause it destacts others

I LOVE his laugh

Was.... that a hetalia meme?!

I think the car light makes it harder for the driver to see outside. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t have it on while the car is moving.

makes sense roomie is in londen

By illuminating the interior of the car you are making it much harder to see outside.  Not rocket science!

2020... wow

Is he really stopping with terraria

Can&#39;t wait till Pewds has kids and finally realizes that Dads ask to turn the overhead light off cause it causes a glare on the windshield...Hes not full boomer just yet

The real reason why parents don&#39;t want you to turn on the lights, specifically at night, is that they can&#39;t see shit when the light is on.

On New Year’s Eve I was in the shower until next decade

Felix congrats on being the 2nd most beautiful man in the world

Is anyone else still wondering when and why Tana and Jake got married? What the heck?

Guys math is related to science because u need to do math to mathscience

I am pretty sure the light in the car thing is illegal in some states when driving because it can cause lower visibility from the glair and reflections it causes, at least that is what I was told after I got hit from doing it

<a href="">2:13</a> I think he literally just described the OSRS youtube community

You don&#39;t turn the light on in the car while driving, because if it&#39;s dark outside than inside the glass will partial act like a mirror. Obscuring vision of the driver. I thought Pewds would understand that.

<b>*when pewdiepie sounds like ninja for a sec*</b> <a href="">3:50</a>

I waited for that like the video animation, but it didn&#39;t come at the end.

Personaly I don&#39;t have the light in the car on because during the night you see less out the window at night because there is more light in the car eaven tho you have head lights on.

People dont like turning the interior light on because it reflects off the inside of the windshield hampering visibility

Woah this video was made last decade. Boy I&#39;m late

how not to make a subreddit better 101complain about it being shit

Those people who don&#39;t like LWIAY, are the ones with small pp &amp; can&#39;t seem to grow big pp

My dad always told me he sees less if the light is on and it&#39;s dark outside.

<a href="">6:56</a> shit

The light causes glare on the windshield

No the car light thing is because when its dark you cant see outside very well !!!!!!

Riiiiigt....Because..Friends....AND MONEY..(NECTAR BED)
&quot;I still have fun reviewing it&quot; Pewds plz. ur reacting not reviewing.

No the light thing is because if it&#39;s brighter inside the car than outside the windshield will reflect the inside of the car instead of showing the road. It&#39;s generally not too bad but if it&#39;s very dark outside and you have too many lights on inside it can be dangerous.

Anyone here play LifeAfter?

The good boomer you didn&#39;t know was from the minions movie,he helped gru

I feel like at night it is harder for the driver to see their surroundings with the interior light on

The post at <a href="">2:08</a> was from the member of the month in my discord server :D (kinda jealous he got in and not me lol)

Pretty sure the car interior light thing is because it makes reflections on the windscreen and impairs the drivers vision? Right?

People don&#39;t seem to understand that decades started being counted in the year 1, so this year isn&#39;t the first year of the decade but the last

Car lights need to be turned off during driving Caus something about the reflection on the window

The reason why the lights are supposed to be off is cause it drains the car battery

when the cabin light is on at night, the driver loses visibility through glass surfaces, like the windshield

mid90s is an amazing movie

My parents always said that I couldn’t turn on lights becuase they couldn’t see the road :/

When the rewind the decade came up, I was wondering if they were gonna rewind the entirety of 2020

Idea for helping the subreddit: Do another greenscreen challenge or something of that nature, thats how it started out

Play TF2

Is that a full metal alchemist artwork ? NANI?!?!

<a href="">9:30</a> no it’s because it distracts the other drivers from where I live

The problems with the light still being on while the motor is not running, is that the battery could be drained empty(especially in winter), also what I was told as a kid is, that when you drive at night and theres a light on, it blinds the driver.

2020?

No, they hate when we turn the light on, cause if we forget them on, we can drain the batteries from the car which causes the car to stop working

The car light also runs down the battery tell a fast

Thank you for leway

Everyone: FMA! Jojo!Me: Did anyone see the hetalia reference?Edit, it&#39;s at <a href="">15:38</a>

Pewds pls

Happy new year!

Turning on the light in a car while it&#39;s dark outside will make the windows reflect and reduce your eye&#39;s light sensitivity, which can make it difficult to see out of the car.

How does Felix not know who Dr Nathario Is?

I’ve been watching pewds since the beginning and I just hit a wave of nostalgia

Hate that u wont continue terraria

that loading bar meme was legit just someone stealing a screenshot from a video of that meme and drawing it

What dose boomer mean

he doesnt have friends dumbass. he makes memes!

I wanna meet the person that dislikes youtube comments

<a href="">8:08</a> because its flatDuh

At <a href="">6:57</a> the censored word &quot;shit&quot; pops back :)

those lights in the car are usually automatically turned on whenever a door is open. So if they are being turned on by people and not by the warning system one cannot tell if the door is open :)

He fell off

For now, the peepee is inconclusive.

No when the light is left on overnight it drains the battery and the car has to be jump-started

Yo people! The end of this decade is next year! Chill

They ask you to keep the lights off in the car at night because when it’s brighter in the car than outside the light reflection on the glass decreases visibility.

I had a dream that I saw brad (dressed like marzia of course) and I asked him “is math related to science?” and he bought me a baguette

Kinda feeling like mrbeast is a little overrated i mean he is a wholesome guy but without the money, would he has that much subscribers tho? Or content worth watching?

Dont disrespect techno
I think that the light thing is because if you are in the front seat, the reflection in the windshield at night can be hard to see through idk

I got a mr beast honey ad on this video.

My parents always told me to not turn on the light because at night when there is light comming from inside the car you can&#39;t see the road that well, and that can be dangerous

Felix you make me angry, fma reference? say sike rn

If it&#39;s dark and you turn your interior lights on, it reduces your ability to see ahead of you because your eyes adjust to the brightness

The decade starts in 2021

No , turning on the light in the car , while you&#39;re in the backseat , doesn&#39;t allow the rider to see cars that are behind cuz of the mirror that u use to see cars behind u , the one in the middle of the car idk what it&#39;s called lol ,n not seeing cars behind u could cause accidents , that&#39;s y it&#39;s illegal

Game viwl sin
Wasting the car battery is one of the reasons for people not liking the light on.But it&#39;s also because it&#39;s kind of distracting for the driver and if it&#39;s dark outside, the light from inside the car can make it difficult to see outside clearly.

Like video

The real reason for car light things is when your family goes on a trip to California and you leave on the light for a weak and a half and have to call your grandparents to come jumpstart your car at the airport.

yes

<a href="">5:15</a>. No. People that walk slow are just high hence the “happiness”

I was told by my driving instructor that you shouldn&#39;t have the lights on in the car while you&#39;re driving at night because it can be distracting and can reduce your ability to see what&#39;s going on in front of the car.

Mr. Beast sux

I was at home eating doritos when i got call&quot;Terarria is kil&quot;&quot;no&quot;

WHATS THE NAME OF THAT GAME IN <a href="">3:10</a>???

The dome light is it a big deal because it&#39;s hard for Boomers to see while driving at night.

<a href="">9:10</a> i know the reason my parents would freak out was bc if i left the light on, it drained the car battery.. and then the car would need a jump-start the next time we used it. but pewds is right, that problem doesn&#39;t really exist anymore with automatic lights.

The f11 tiger shot itself down because it was too fast for its own bullets, that’s crazy

<a href="">9:15</a> it&#39;s because it&#39;s hard to see other cars out of the rear mirror.

We got into all sorts of fuck shit, and we had games ‍️ kids are gonna get into shit. Hahaha

Liked for &quot;London sucks&quot;! P.S. &quot;London sucks&quot;! Get British you knife wielding losers!

The Light in the car is dangerous at night, because it can worsen the sight of the driver ( reflections in the Glas and so on ) and it could distract other drivers.

what does lwiay mean

<a href="">18:09</a> But it&#39;s a JoJo fanart

about the car lights i have a fairly old car now 22 years and the problem with the thing is that its so bright you start seeing your own reflection instead of the god damn road when driving at night. So it&#39;s not illegal but still hella anoying as you can&#39;t see the road when its not lit up good enough.

<a href="">14:10</a> Pewds hasn’t seen Despicable Me

the light in the car is for ppl walking on the side of the road without any refexes is unseeable when the light is on blinding ur side of ur eye so it&#39;s for others sercurity

If you are driving during the night and it is really dark and then a passenger suddenly turn on the light within the car it can impair the view of the road. Making it dangerous. Also, I can imagine the light reflecting on the glass making also impairing the view.

<a href="">10:11</a>You missed the upvote :O

that was a jojo reference

parents tell you not to click the lights because if you forget them on overnight in the morning the car wont have batteries and it wont start

If you are feelind stressed or want to work on bigger projects, i think many if not all your fans would not mind weekly uploads, good art cannot be rushed ;)

The WiFi router thing:Just buy a NodeMCU for $2 and make it Beacon all of those networks....

isn&#39;t the light inside the car thing about it disrupts the view if it&#39;s dark outside? Bc it reflects in the windows if it&#39;s that much brighter inside than it is outside. It&#39;s not really a problem if you drive in cities and such but if you live in the middle of nowhere and it actually gets dark outside for real then it&#39;s gonna make it impossible to see.

i wached the cats movie 3/5 stars

<a href="">11:25</a> The no new content meme was a gag meme, I hope obviously.. It&#39;s a matter of easily browsable data that pewdiepies content rotates regularly, and more often that not people ask unsuccessfully for things to be reinstated (Fridays with Pewds is a common one, and not sure I&#39;ll never tire of Minecraft).I see you had to generate a somewhat attention grabbing and controversial question to make it one, showing that you know you&#39;re writing into a crowded schedule

Has Felix seriously still not watched Jojo&#39;s? It&#39;s a meme machine.

Umm... guys? The new decade starts next year.Think about it: the first decade (10 years) started from year 1 until year 10. The second decade was 11-20. We’re still in the same decade.Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

you ever just have inconclusive pp?

About the light thing, in my opinion at night you should leave the lights in the car turned off because you can see better outside. If it&#39;s darker inside it will seem brighter outside

god damn it 2020 isn&#39;t a new decade, 2021 will be. Because some idiot decided to start counting from Year 1 instead of Year 0.

Y is it on krakens whos ur daddy playlist

The reason you aren&#39;t supposed to turn the reading lights on while driving is because it reduces visibility at night. Having a brighter interior makes the outside more difficult to see, and could also cause reflections or glare on the inside of the windshield, further reducing visibility.

Also the microtransactions are pretty bad...

The bloody car light causes glare on the windscreen, mainly at night.  So it is dangerous. It&#39;s the same concept as closing the blinds when watching tv cause it causes glare. Turn them dang lights off.

what is pewdiepies subreddit name?

Uhh for the car light meme I was taught to keep it off because it distracts other drivers and you can be pulled over. ‍️

If you turn on the light in the car at night then you can’t really see out the rear view mirror that’s why it’s sketchy.

Actually pewds, the reason you don’t turn on the car lights is because it makes it difficult to see out the front window due to reflection properties of the glass. And in daytime we always want to yell at our kids

The light in the car thing reduces visibility actually

My merch is coming tomorrow

Lol my dad recently retired and bought an Xbox One X with a Samsung QLED TV and now that’s all he does. At least he’s enjoying life rn

My parents were fine with the light being on as long as we warned them beforehand and shut it off when we were done

I was personally attacked when he said Terraria was over ;-;

PEWDS NEVER SAY DIE

<a href="">9:10</a> the reason why is because it is dangerous because it makes it harder to see. It can cause a wreck. Also it is illegal. At least where I live.

Lmao, every anime he sees he says &quot;Is this full metal alchemist?&quot;

When theres light on inside the car and its dark out, its harder to see because the light reflects back from the windows. Open up the curtains in your living room at midnight and see if you can see past the person staring back at you

Dads turn off the roof light because headlights used to be crappy and the light inside the car made it even harder to see at night. Nowadays with streetlights everywhere and better headlights on every car and better roads and markings and guardrails etc than in the 70’s that it’s not relevant anymore.

The reason we shouldnt turn on lights while driving is because light in the foreground is making it hard to see while driving at night

This sub has gone to shit . Its turned into karmawhoring repost and Pewds unrelated The mods dont care  Pewds has called people out on it and it still Hasnt changed  i know this is going to get lost In new but we need to stop this the sub is now Awfull its not r/memes or r/dankmemes Go post your memes there Can we get back to the good Old days of awesome fanarts not 5 minute scribbles u/yxng_elmo
