That’s so sad omg why 😭😭😭

Why wasn&#39;t this on News??

My thing is...how her head get caught in the door in the first place? The doors close slow enough for a turtle to get out the way...wtf was she doing

This is nyc. We keep our heads down and mind our business. Like everyone should do

what do you expect from the Americans? dead heart. this lady she&#39;s lucky they didn&#39;t shot her in the head just for fun

Fake for hidden camera ;)

I hope they fired that MTA working! Assholes

She doesn&#39;t seem to care about her situation

Why did nobody help her?I hope she is ok

Nobody help welcome to modern world..

Employee at <a href="">0:38</a> better have been fired. Person who recorded and uploaded this better be unable to walk and speak. Otherwise, just as bad or worse.

Why didn’t the guy filming go and help the woman?

That stupid Dumb Mta Lady that walked pass the helpless lady with her head stuck should be terminated from her job. But God will her judge her on judgment day and most likely she will end up in hell.

Hello, I am a reporter at the Press Association, a UK news agency. Would you mind emailing me at catherine.wyatt@pressassociation.com - I would like to ask you a few questions about this vid! Thanks :)

Description needs to be changed: Woman&#39;s head is stuck between train doors and train riders just stare without care while I, also without care, record her plight to post on social media.

I can&#39;t see how people fall in the gap but this is classic
