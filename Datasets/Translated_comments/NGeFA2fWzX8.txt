I don’t care how unrealistic that catch was, it means something to me 😭

Roman Pearce, Brian&#39;o Conner, Letty Ortiz, Owen Shaw, Dom Toretto

I would done the exact same thing for my girl like dom did

i do not understand the physics but the clip is AWESOME!!!!

Dom is brave!

Still one of the best moments of Fast and Furious though❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Weon HAY UNA ESCENA

Jhþ
Still one of the best scenes in the series

This may be the greatest action scene I&#39;ve ever seen

In the script Letty is supposed to die, but Vin Diesel improvised and saved her. Tge director like so much he kept in the movie

Eat plenty of tuna and you will get super powers

Can you imagine if he missed her hahahaha.

I&#39;ll take <b>My</b> action with Extra cheese, thankyou very much! 😂👌

This is so realistic, this is the cinema - Martin Scorsese

I gave it to Rapheal- hasta i trust her

Read between the lines journal Superior, Program Matter, Scarlet, Original, all handbooks of the Antichrist lets just say he talkin right now think of 2008 snack time it time to eat , 2 blocks

2015 🥲
This was the exact moment Dom turned into Heisenberg

Physics has left the chat.

<a href="">2:36</a> the power of family

I just turned 21 in 2013 n it was a fun yr til the fall came n it sucked

I genuinely cant tell if some of these comments are supposed to be jokes

<a href="">2:38</a>  Why does Dom get launched here before the car even hits the wall?

People saying a lot of this scene is unrealistic - literally only the dom jump is ‘unrealistic’ lol80% if this screen is completely practical

<a href="">1:07</a> I love that moment with Roman and Brian. Just an iconic duo 😅

Man I love this scene!

Dom was already in the air before he wrecked his Daytona to save letty 🤣 I&#39;m now seeing this <a href="">2:38</a>

Bollywood style 😂

Is this a remake of The Matrix... Dom is basically Neo

<a href="">0:41</a>

Screw it boom..Behind the scenes they jumped that skyline like 8 times untill it looked real enough and landed

I had faith

The most ridiculous scene
This is the point at which Dom jumped over the shark an into the AWESOMEVERSE

<a href="">2:30</a> 😂

He must think he captain America

Me trying to figure out how many takes they had to go through to get the right one

Who needs physics when you have family ?

Y’all still mad that family &gt; gravity and it shows

That's true love
&quot;I didn't know we were going to fall here, I had faith.&quot;
In next fast furious they will reveal that toretto born in lab with dna upgrade

IN THE AIR, WEON!
Bro,wow!❤
Letty doesn&#39;t have any momentum.

Bro back is too strong

Pff i did that in real life

vin deisel hitting the car saying &quot;augh&quot; was funny <a href="">2:40</a>

Fonzie jumped the shark. Letty jumped the tank.

It was at this moment fast and furious abandoned reality

Although this is over the top this is as close to romance moment that we dudes will watch

And Vin Diesel says: "I didn't know we were going to fall here, I had faith."
WHAT! ¡!WHEEEE??!!!!
only time I&#39;ve ever walked out of a movie was after this scene

All these movies are so stupid and over the top.. you have to turn your brain off to even slightly enjoy😉

ridiculous!

Will anyone with editing skills please add cartoon sound effects to this? It’s the only thing that fits with this scene.

That white tee stays clean

The physics of this scene makes no sense

My whole theatre laughed when dom flew like super man

This was when I gave up on this franchise

I gave up watching this crap after this movie came out.

The director really thought he was cooking something

More like this is going to come
Everyone in my theater groaned at the same time when this happened 😂😂

It's a complete smoke, and I love it
<a href="">1:05</a> The way this scene brings me nostalgia Brian &amp; Roman from 2f2f😭

ooo so thats plot armor

IN THE AIR WEOOON IN THE AIREEEE!!
It’s just the situational awareness some of these feats require it’s like the characters in universe can see the future

LOL HATERS ARE SHOOK , they just had to come see it themselves

trident 👊
naow

This scene isn&#39;t about realism its about the symbolism that anything is possible with love &amp; family.

i will never understand the people who would watch this scene and say they shouldve stuck to street racing

I’ve never seen any of these movies except this one, a mate dragged me to it when we were away on a work trip, I died laughing in this bit😂

they cut out the best part

Just searched this bc its so funny

Brian and Rome always made a better duo in my opinion.

Relive memory WHATEEEE?!!WHATEEEEEE!!!!! :V
And ten of them fly away and the other one flies away and they collide in the air wow, in the air!! What?
And Vin Diesel flies away!!
The scene that changed the history of cinema !!! 🤣🤣🤣

<a href="">2:48</a>QUEEEEE!QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!

Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson Vs Luke Evans, Michelle Rodriguez And Joe Taslim
UNPHASED

These two ❤❤ 😭 😭
I demand that Dom should be in next avengers movie to save the earth, as i know he has secret superpowers.

When Roman said “YEAHH!”, That was proof when he was his best friend :(

what’s brian driving here?

Imagine he missed

It made sense that the toothy car fell on the elephant.
So many awesome classic cars destroyed for a scene, though.

In the air webon

<a href="">2:21</a>

No one :Some British sergeant in Al-Mazrah :

I can&#39;t believe that Shaw use letty as pawn

Back when Dom still had the infinity stones.

:2:35   Khe Khe??!

Jumping the shark? No, this movie jumped a TANK.

Did anybody hear when dom Landed on the car after saving letty he was like “IEEEEE”

WALLY BAYOLA HAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHA

Vin diesel is Soo brave😵🙀 and strong 💪🙀🙀🥵...This is what is meant when said Partner in Crime 🖇️📌🔥🔥🔥
Still one of the greatest dumbest scenes I’ve ever seen

this would look great on ticktok

<a href="">2:40</a> wtf

One of my favorite scenes

Oh I miss Brian O&#39;Conner!! I found out about the show too late.

Ah yes world of tanks in fast and furious be like

Best scene of all of fast and fruits and the reason vin diesel did the impossible because he had family

This scene is what killed the franchise lol

Absolutely loved this scene even tho it was unrealistic lol

Perfect Timing

I had faith weon
Doms white shirt is made of vibranium

actually this happened to me once on the bridge over Lake Pontchartrain. What are the odds?

This showed up in my snapchat feed came here to watch the scene i will not be watching the movie .....

Do whatever it takes save your LADY, if you die you die TOGETHER 💪💙
EN EL AIRE WEON

This is so funny plz 😭🖐

<a href="">2:23</a> how did she hear him? 😂😂

Ridiculous? Yes. Stupid? Yes. Awesome? HELL YEAH!

These Movies are getting ridiculous.

Is a car that size even capable of stoping a literal Tank? I mean i get it was hooked onto something but still....

IN THE AIR WEOOON!!!
Badass
Yogi at its Best

So far this is my fav scene in fast 6

In it weon air
HES LITERALLY SUPERMAN

Hi everybody just wanted to let you know that god loves everyone and everyone should give most of our time to him he loves you 😊❤️

The Fast and Furious family could stop Russia all by themselves.

A movie for 7 year olds?

I almost walked out of the theater when I saw this.

A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins 💗

<a href="">2:39</a>QUEEEEE!!!!!!…..QUEEEEEEEE!!!!!?????????
Dom supposed to had been dead 6 fast and furiouses ago

Lol what??

C&#39;mon Dom. Why you gotta always get those pricey and rare cars just to destroy them at the end? I mean, I get it. You had to save Letty. But for God&#39;s sake atleast have mercy on your car.

Why does everyone land on the damn Windscreen?

Nahhhhh this man loves this woman….. that’s love like for real

Today falls on 12/30/2021, the end and the beginning of a new year. Oh God, what is in my dog? I hope that my farewell will come to him. The time is <a href="">5:10</a> at night to the bottom Z ❤
Even more recently he caught a car with his bare hands while standing on top of another car 😂

Yeah the movies are unrealistic af now, but they’re still entertaining

This is what you will need to do to get drivers license in future.

<a href="">2:39</a>

There lost and noone says anything....now violence Luke the silence of the lambs

We are witnessing the power of Family at its finest form, ladies and gentlemen

I did not know bollywood is invovled in this scene

FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For family

The power family is strong with this one. May the family be with you

Physics died a slow painful death after watching this.

Anything for family 🤧

No PHYSICS was harmed during the making of this scene.

Epic moment !!

This is the best scene in the entire fast franchise for me

This is by a HUGE margin the worst stunt i&#39;ve ever seen whoever came up with that should be boiled in beezlenut oil.

Most realistic scene evah!!
and the bad guy will throw the ball to the open receiver and dom picks it off. INTERCEPTION! All turnovers will be reviewed but dom made sure that it didnt hit the ground

Dom is like a superhero :D

Best actor paul walker 😭😭😭
The superbird tho

Jordana looks gorgeous!
Jordana and Paul look great!

Michelle looks gorgeous!
Vin and Michelle look great!

Best scene in the whole series

you would do anything to save the person you love, if you like it

I think Dom has the super soldier serum

Whaaaat? To Spanish from Spain
Even gravity gave up for Dom&#39;s Family

Family is the greatest superpower💪🦾Hence Proved.

You were not made difficult except to make it easy, and you were not distressed except to be relieved, and he did not make you cry except to make you laugh, and he did not make you miserable except to make you happy, and he did not withhold from you except to compensate you, and he only afflicted you because he loves you, so seek forgiveness from God, perhaps it is an hour of response ❤️
Can a actor tell the director to down play his bullshit scene a little bit?

I had faith
EN EL AIRE, WEON! EN EL AIRE!

<a href="">2:38</a> he saved her

FAMILY !

When I find the film

Only one thing saved Letty here and it wasn’t Dom - it was family

Tedd in f9: as long as we abide the laws of physicsTorreto: and I took that personality

EN EL AIRE WEON

we don&#39;t need physics ,we got family.
The power of family

I wanna be just like him when I glow up

Can we get some physics in these action scenes please?

moral in that stund that...&quot;For a real man&#39;s true love he will become super man... At some instinct&quot;

There were reports that Isaac Newton died when he saw this scene

Dominic Toretto: I Believe I Can Fly. I Believe I Can Save Letty.

thats tuff

if the tank can&#39;t go faster than 60kmh + it got a smash car slowing it down and Dom car is probably 120+Kmh speed will it possible to save Letty like the movie?

EN EL AIRE WEON, EN EL AIRE

By the speed he was going it doesn’t require gravity is just good timing ⏱ the car worked as a sling shot for don to catch her in time before she started falling

Dom : for the family

Be honest guys, put the logic in trash can, this scene was epic despite it. I love this series no matter how much illogic it is. At last, cinema is what you find entertaining and no logical.

Gravity: she&#39;s going to dieDom:she&#39;s my familyGravity:Mm ok

Issac newton: No! You can&#39;t just ignore the laws of physicsDom: <b>haha family go brrr</b>

All this talk about Toretto flying.. a tank could never move as fast as all those cars 😂

This is when I decided to stop watching this stuff but I got to be honest it gave me a good laugh for like a good week

Fast and Furious 1: *Physics existsFast and Furious 6: *Physics has left the chat

😂😂😂😂😂

Who comes to FF for physics? It’s a movie. It’s just entertainment. Y’all want physics? Watch a documentary 🤣

<a href="">1:07</a> that little moment between Brayan and Roman hits different now

Wow! Whaaaat! en el aire weon
I had faith
The family saved Letty

I still think this is the best scene out of any of the fast and furious movies. I would have done the same thing for the woman I love. I&#39;m not saying that it would have been the exact same outcome🙏🏾😂 but I would have definitely crashed and jumped to save her. It would honestly be the only way.

He had faith 😎

In the air weon! In the air!
<a href="">2:37</a> and they collide in the air weon IN THE AIR!!!!!
Family

this is the scene that changed the fast and furious series to the Marvel Avengers deleted scenes

Don&#39;t worry guys...he&#39;s got family

People keep forgeting that this is the FF universe and don&#39;t know what law of physics apply there

Dom legit looked like Thor when he caught Letty

Physics of a bollywood movie

In the aireeee webon!!!!
I went to the movie theater and there was nothing to see in the movie theater, and there was only Fast and Furious 6 to watch. Weon, WEON, and there's a scene... LISTEN TO ME. NO. There is a scene in which Vin Diesel is in his car, on a bridge... ON A BRIDGE that has a gap and a tank comes from the other side and then FLYING OUT, and Vin Diesel FLYING OUT and they crash into the air, weon. IN THE AIR, WEON. And they fall on top of a car and Vin Diesel says "I didn't know we were going to fall here." "I had faith." THAT?! WHAT?!
Letty got have some WAP cause ain’t no way she got this man defying the laws of physics for her😩😅

This was last fast movie I saw in theaters 🎭

I don’t care what anyone says , after Tokyo Drift this franchise became a complete mess

This is arguably the moment when the fast and furious became WAY over the top

Who needs gravity - when you got family🔥

He saved her because she was his family.

I can&#39;t believe I actually watched this film... ridiculous.

<b>Gravity and Isaac Newton at the movie theaters watching this</b> : &quot;Aight let&#39;s head out&quot;

You don&#39;t need logic  when you got Family?

Probably the most cheesy stunt in the franchise lol

<a href="">2:35</a> <a href="">2:38</a> Doms car crashes twice

Instead of shooting the bridge why didn&#39;t they just straight up shoot the car??

THE CRAZY PART IS TYRESE PART OF JUMPING OUT LOOKS MORE REALISTIC THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
Corny by lmao
All I imagine watching this is Lety being the clay disc and Dom the shotgun.

So bad... Comically bad.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHH

Doms family plot armor

One of the most bullshit fast and furious scenes of all time

Everything seems possible except the landing tbh

Issac Newton - Whats the meaning of this..Dom - It make sense if you have Family

ok f off.

That poor ‘69 Charger Hemi...my favorite car, ruined :(

No just no.

In the air weon in the air!
Apparently a solid metal car can break your fall

THAT? THAT?!
Take my panties now dom!

In the weon air
EN EL AIRE WEON, EN EL AIRE!!!!

Internet: Rey is a Mary Sue. Mulan is a Mary Sue. Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue. Waaahhh...Also Internet: we love you Dom!!!!

I had faith
This was the beginning of the end for this franchise. It just got way out of hand from here.

Now they&#39;re just copying my Batmobile moves. ;-;

<a href="">2:37</a> Worst thing is that Toreto doesn&#39;t even seen to be hurt by that.

I&#39;m going to give this movie credit for not having Letty immediately regain her memory when she slammed against the car.

From the first movie to this…🤣

(HERE IS THE GOSPEL MESSAGE OF JESUS CHRIST) JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SINS AND HE WAS BURIED AND HE ROSE AGAIN ON THE THIRD DAY BY FAITH IN GOD&#39;S SON THE LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST AND JESUS CHRIST ONLY SALVATION SHALL BE YOURS AND ETERNAL LIFE WITH GOD IN HEAVEN WILL AWAIT YOU WHEN YOU DIE THE BIBLE JOHN CHAPTER 3 VERSES 16 THROUGH 21 AS WELL AS 1ST CORINTHIANS CHAPTER 15 VERSES 1 THROUGH 5 THE BIBLE
In the AIR dude!!!
That is the Brian o Conor way

Torreto guy is great❤️❤️❤️ what a jump jumpiyath..
I started to almost cry when dom jumped after letty, that is What I call true love ❤️

The most badass saving a person scene in movie history

<a href="">1:56</a> a big mistake in this movie guyz how car was still dragged ? a piller came between bridges but car was still dragged by tank🤣😂🤣😂

Shut up about the physics it’s still awesome

Sooo dumb 🤣🤣
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins  then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily please  and Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 ( Not trying to force upon anyone who doesn’t agree)

<a href="">2:36</a> Letty weighs like what? (lets be honest) 120 and Doms momentum is like he just caught a 5 pound kitten

Ouch my brain the people who consume this is why democracy doesn&#39;t work

This is ok but would&#39;ve been better if a T-REX was about the eat Letty out of the air and Dom came in on a Pterodactyl to save her

Bro...like atleast lose consciousness cmon now

Physics 101: Family by Dom

Friends are trying to convince me to watch the newest fast and furious movie and came back here for reference for why I hate these movies now

his shirt wasn&#39;t even wrinkled

Because of scenes like this, I think that Toretto was left in a coma after crashing in the last scene of scene 1 and this is a dream, I mean, he's going to wake up without legs hahahahaha
<b>IN THE AIR WEBÓN!</b> <b>IN THE AIR!</b>
That bridge is over 100 metres high, they should have died of a Godzilla size fall.

Toreto is like DIO, they don&#39;t believe in gravity.

Love when people get pissed of by these movies. Makes my day 😂😂😂

Its amazing how a steel cable can magically got right threw concrete i guess they didn’t this anyone would notice lol

I only come to say one thing regarding this wonderful scene...WHAT?! WHATEEEEEE?!
Tis the power of family.

<b>WHO NEEDS PHYSICS WHEN YOU GOT FAMILY</b>

EN EL AIRE WEON!

Isaac Newton died after watching this scene

That scene is worth all the millions of the entire franchise: v
Faith is the most beautiful thing in life

Alto cine.

It can't be real hahahahahaha
EN EL AIRE WEON

Neo must to learn how to fly in the first matrix film but this guy Mr. Toretto no need to learn how to fly. He can fly across the bridge without getting hurt.

&quot;EN EL AIRE WEON&quot;

After 7 and 8, this is still realistic.

In reality he would just fall straight down

this franchise is a dam joke. Go back to street racing. The first movie had soccer moms racing in their mini vans.

Thank god that glass was there to not cut him once so ever after hitting it doing about 60mph through the air

Everyone talking about how physics is ignored by that jump, but my question is how is the car running from <a href="">2:30</a> to <a href="">2:36</a>? Doms is on top of the car, how is he putting his leg on the acceleration? Does he have super long legs or something?

Physics and Biology: “welp, we’re out, it’s all up to you now.”Chemistry: “cmon guys don’t leave me :(“

I had faith
PHYSICS committed suicide...

QUEEEE!!??QUEEEE!!!??

<a href="">2:39</a>EN EL AIRE WEON!!!EN EL AIRE WEON!!!

This may have been nearly impossible to survive but I gotta say this is one of my favourite movie scenes ever

I am a simple man, when I see anything named Fast &amp; Furious I forgot everything I knew about the laws of physics.

And Vin Diesel says: &quot;I didn't know we were going to fall here, I had faith.&quot;WHAT! WHEEEE!
EN EL AIRE WEON

roman screaming sounds like cj on fire

Dom chose family or physics

<a href="">2:39</a> how?

That would be a shattered spine

They turned my man Dom into Superman

Newton&#39;s Laws of GravitationDom: what laws?

What ??? Whats i am wrong?? His joe taslim from indonesian actors ?

Listen, no, listen, there's a scene where Vin Diesel is in his car on a bridge, on a bridge that has a gap, and a tank comes from the other side, and a ball goes flying, and Vin Diesel goes flying, and he crashes. encochan in the air, IN THE AIR WEON! And Vin Diesel tells him, I didn't know we were going to fall here, I had faith... WHAT!! THAT!!!!
Poor Mustang 🥲
stupid 😂😂

I came here for Paul walker

Fast &amp; furious movies are just entertainers.. watch it for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY... if you want to learn physics &amp; science then please go to SCHOOL guys...

Legends are here in 2021

This Dude jacked up on heroin 24/7 and gained superhuman abilities

Both of them could have died but this tells me dom has superpowers this would not work in real life

In the air weon! IN THE AIR WEOOOOOOOOON!!!
Man! Dom Just ruined a perfectly Good Dodge Daytona!

LMFAAAO

Always cracks me up

QUE????!!!!!!!

Thats love right there. He must really love her.

Not offer nothing special, like American movies are all typical the same crap

If the bridges were a little closer, and he did this in real life he might have bad it.

Dominic Toretto:The Last Physics Bender.

and fast furious its dais very beautiful film

this is the only video that has the most funniest comments ever.and everytime i came here is not for the video but for the comments

I swear dom maxed out his luck stats

I won&#39;t be surprised if dom launched a car from space

This was one of my favorites scenes.👍👍👍

Its A Hollywood action pack movie. Its suppose to go down like that. If you watching for realism, then your watching for the wrong reason. Want real reality? Just wake up in the morning and ohh, ...don&#39;t turn on the TV.

Mission impossible

Why is it so high-tech and quiet inside of that tank?

3 3AST 3 3URIOUS

Very forced

80s action movies never died. Hopefully FF9 will also bring back bullet-proof shrubbery to the silver screen.

that&#39;s some good quality windshield.

Why didnt dom break his spine. Oh wait he has fAmiLy.

I had faith
Guys just look at the Fast Saga as taking place in an alternate universe where human beings are just more resistant to death than in the real world

Is that physics ly possible ?

Toretto saves Lety
Oh look, a bridge...-Owen Shaw

Isaac Newton never existed in this universe.

EN EL AIRE WEON!!!!!!

and none of the commentators here are surprised how this piece of iron which was a car before could turn a 60 tons tank

Ok but how tf his back never break 😭🤟💀

Do you know why he survived that jumpCause he got script

Why has Vin Diesel not been called up by Nick Fury yet? Give the man a car and he can defeat any villain in the MCU.

Owww, this is a superheros movie of course 😅Oh silly me

So in Fast and Furious franchise, Cars can fly, next movie Cars can float in the sea

xd

His superpower is NOS

WHAT!!

Dom save Letty at the Bridge by Came out of his car &amp; jump on the other side of the Bridge &amp; hold on to Letty very tight in his arms.

<b>I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS</b>

<a href="">2:12</a> i like how the daytona sped up trying to catch up to the tank.

no physic law allowed in this movies..

qwertyghkñmsa
I can’t Count how many charges r here like police charges lmao

Erode tower 1

Psychics ?

the collision would of killed them both, easily.

Ok Logically speaking, was the car enough to stop him from getting broken into pieces?

all this no one noticed no cops

I honestly find this more believable than when Dom headbutts Shaw&#39;s big sasquatch in the plane 😂😂 He really flew then 😂

Birds walked out mad Birds:cars don’t fly

IN THE AIR WEON
Vin deasel wouldve went splat and blood wouldve been all over the place the moment he hit that windshield but since its rated PG13, physics just get booted out the window

Who else loves dom he is so cute even my mom likes him my dad don’t care 😆

Movies are interesting

🕉☪✝PRAY FOR MY LOVE PLZ FRIENDS   🙏GODBLESS YOU ALL 🙏BEAUTIFUL SOULS 💕LOTS OF LOVE FROM ODISHA-DELHI 👍👌😘😍
Imagine if dom missed her 😂😂

Rip dodge Daytona

Copied comment:Newton: What the hell?! How does gravity whom i&#39;ve spent half-of my time researching and trying to figure out how it works so broken in this movie?!Toretto: nothing is impossible if i have <b>FAMILY.</b>

XD

Gravity from some where habahahaha......

Best scene ever
I like  doms movie&#39;s

Huebón!
RIP Physics 😂

Gets the girl, shatters back Happy ending.

Yeahhhhhhh🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was simply mad that Dom messed that beautiful car just to save Letty

<a href="">2:40</a> wow he’s super durable

When I watched this in the theater someone yelled Kiss already.😂

Dom is a very good man

Maybe his muscle helped him break his fall a little bit

<a href="">1:37</a> now that is Sean&#39;s father

Ayo wtf

I just realized how Paul Walker slowly transition to Kevin Love 😂😂

At <a href="">1:57</a> how’d the cable get through the cement pillar? 🤔🤔

You guys don’t understand what this scene they want to tell you, they trying to show  that Don loves Letty so much, that he willing to sacrificed his car just to get Letty. For Don, Letty&gt;Car&gt;Realistic

this scene is beyond ridiculous lol.

I just now realized i live there.

Of course, this scene might be amazing.Dom: Fans are family.

Fun fact this is actually possible in real life but both would definitely die or dom has serious injury when he hits the windshield lol

I attempted to work with math on this. Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez weigh 102kg and 54kg respectively. Let&#39;s assume both are flying at 100km/h. That gives Vin and Michelle a total momentum of 2754kgm/s and 1458kgm/s respectively. Now, I assumed that Vin flew off his car at 45 degrees to the road, and Michelle was flung off the tank at 20 degrees to the road (but in the opposite direction, so -20 degrees)Splitting the momentum into two components using these assumed angles:Vin = 1947kgm/s parallel and perpendicular to the road.Michelle = 1370kgm/s parallel to the road, and -498kgm/s perpendicular to the road.Now let&#39;s assume this is an elastic collision, and that there&#39;s no drag or air resistance. Once Vin and Michelle combine in the air, the components from these momentums combine to make a single object, whose momentum is 3317kgm/s parallel to the road and 1449kgm/s perpendicular to the road. As the perpendicular momentum is positive, that means Vin and Michelle would still move towards the other lane. However, Vin won&#39;t be travelling at a 45 degree angle anymore.Calculating the new angle is as easy as calculating the inverse tangent of the ratio between the perpendicular momentum and the parallel momentum, or in easier terms: 1/tan(1449/3317). The final angle comes out to 23.6 degrees.Instead of travelling at a 45 degree angle to the roads, Vin and Michelle should now be flying at half that angle and more parallel to the roads. After reviewing where Vin catches Michelle in the video, the outcomes would either be (in decreasing order of likelihood):1. Slamming off the blue guard rail and falling to their deaths2. Falling to the deaths without hitting anything3. Landing on the road, not the car, at approximately 83km/h.In conclusion, they&#39;re dead, comatose, or if they&#39;re lucky, crippled.Edit: Okay it&#39;s July 2022 and I&#39;d like to apologise for this comment. In the process of calculating everything, I completely failed to account for <b>F A M I L Y</b> which negates all physical constraints and replaces them all with whatever Dom feels like. For the record, I think the skyscraper jump in Furious 7 could be a one in a billion long shot.

i had faith

EN EL AIRE WEBON

I came here from tiktok anyone else???

In the air, boy, IN THE AIR, HUEVON!!
A moment of silence was observed by the scientific community for this scene.

when the writers failed &quot; low of conservation of momentum&quot;  test

I like letty and all but was it worth the car

Paul Walker.... 😢 😢
Dom got the demon back. He&#39;s related to Baki.

they&#39;re in a tank so why didn&#39;t they just shoot the cars

<a href="">0:22</a> my love video :X

had faith
He hits me. A lot. It was fine. I love it so much. A lot. Eslamegor. Movie👌👌👌👌👌😃😃😃😃👌
I had faith
Just think doms precision has developed so much since losing to a LONE TRUCK DRIVER ON A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY.     😜

this should be part of the mcu

Doms a superhuman. Simple.

I thought nothing would top this garbage scene and then they did the torpedo scene.

Oh look, a bridge.Somethings familiar with that line.

Any one see the crolla at <a href="">1:31</a>

In the air weon!
I mean ik everyone is talking physics but leaving out one major point, the car is going at least 60mph when it hits. The car stops but because he is not held down by the car he is still going to fly. We shouldn’t be talking about the physics, we SHOULD be talking about how he was able to aim and time it perfect

Dom keep up, you have broken the force of gravity by from your car to save Letty, I would like you guys visit Kenya in East Africa

had faith
had faith
Best pick up move I&#39;ve seen so far.

The moment when Fast and Furious became a superhero movie

tbh i would care more abt the ultra rare car 😂

QUEEE!!! QUEEE!!!

I believe I can fly

I had faith
i watched every part in this moviefrom 2001 to 2019Greeaaat 🖤🖤

D q n countless times q repeated scene nato...amazed n amazed p djn aq
Now saving Letty here wasn’t impossible according to the laws of physics, but it was highly, highly unlikely. There’d be a 0.0000000000327 chance you’d actually be able to pull that off

He is like NOKIA 3310 throw him from anywhere then reassemble him as good as new only difference is phone starts with 🤝handshake sign and he is like in thick voice (hahaha family )😂😂

I’m more confused about how a tank was at all affected by an old mustang lmao

Oh look. A bridge. He must&#39;ve just gotten off of gta v or something similar.

<a href="">0:36</a> RIP Paul

Tell me name and model of the car dominic driving

EN EL AIRE WEON!!!!

I had faith, my friend would say
in the teater when we saw this part everybody like: yeah sure

I am watching the movie now... after seeing this scene I came straight here because for a second I thought I was the only one that got cheated by my physics teacher..I can now go back and finish my movie..

I had faith
Dom is bald and strong and apparently has superpowers. Dom is saiama confirmed

Well i guess avengers have more logic than this

I love their chemistry

May i ask where is the police?

Dom should have fought thanos

This is fast 6

Imagine he missed

I had faith :v
<a href="">2:30</a> 

 how fake. A car can never do that with a tank because a car does not weigh as much as a tank.

Why didn&#39;t the rope wrap around the pillar between the bridge? <a href="">1:55</a>

HAY UNA ESCENA CUCHAMEEEE

JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA PURE BULLSHIT!!!

The Letty catch was real. No stunt doubles.

<a href="">0:35</a> coincidentally the rubble was set up just right for it to be a ramp

Maybe that’s why the avengers couldn’t beat thanos the first time, because the other half of the avengers were here

I had faith.
they should have hooked two cars to the tank, and swing it around like the vault in brasil..

Bruh who cares about realism in an action movie I wanna see stupid over the top action

EN EL AIRE, HUEVÓN. EN EL AIRE.

1% of the chat like of comments 5 :99% of the chat likes are 1k. Btw why did letty look more hurt thing vin if he was slammed in to a windshield

Spiderman catches mary jane <a href="">2:39</a>

Realistic

EN EL AIRE WEON, EN EL AIRE

After all that not a single stain on doms white T shirt lmao

“I don’t have physics, I got family”

In the weon air
This franchise died after F&amp;F4.But I hear the next one is supposed to be good. They team up with the NSA to repel an alien invasion.

And Vin Diesel says I had faithWHAT?!?WHAT?!?
In the air weon in the air, WHATEEEE!? WHATEE!?
Issac newton left the room. He went to commit suicide.

QUEEEEEQUEEEEEEE

There&#39;s a chance(very low) of the catch actually happening coz Dom is heavier...inertia and stuff, but with just a tiny bit of death or serious injuries. There are worse scenes in F&amp;F franchise 😂😂 like Whoa🤯

Late as comment. But I just love the sound of that Ford Escort, especially when he shifts before the jump!

It would be funny if dom not crashed in the car,,instead flying all over the bridge

a fine lie is always better than a bad truth :)

Apparently driving fast cars grants you superpowers. Can you just imagine how powerful Formula 1 Racers are?

&quot;I didn't know we were going to fall here, I had faith.&quot; THAT?!?! WHAT?!?!??
This is the worst movie that I ever seen

Holy Jesus....the DoD would let a loose tank 😂

This is more exaggerated than my mother-in-law's sermons.
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

In the air weon, IN THE AIR!
THEY COLLIDE IN THE AIR WEON, IN THE AIR WEON! AND THEY FALL ON A CAR AND VIN DIESEL SAYS "I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE GOING TO FALL HERE, I HAD FAITH" WHAT?! WHAT?!
Lol ok

So stupid ...

<a href="">2:40</a> - I can practically feel my spine PULVERIZING in my back!! Surely it&#39;s because I&#39;m not Vin Diesel, but still...

They sucked each other, they sucked each other again, this never happens in life, don't suck
wtf was that?

And they collide in the air, weón... <b>IN THE AIR, WEÓN</b>
And Letty&#39;s fine after getting slammed into a car

I got family

QUEEEEEE

<a href="">2:46</a> and vin diesel says: I didn't know we were going to fall here, I had faith. KE!! KEEE!?
and a weona flies away and vin diesel flies away...
SUPER MAN DOMINIC TORETTO 💪💪💪
I could believe everything from this scene except the fact his white tee stayed clean

Anyone in 2020?

1 word ----&gt; Love. Have you ever heard of those stories where mothers pickup cars to save their children? (Yes cars in real life, a toddler even picked up a bookcase to save his little brother -it is on YouTube look it up). People should be 100% willing to do this for their children first and mate 2nd...

Mercedes windshield perfect for landing

Laws of Physics be dammed

Goldeneye! XD

I&#39;m sorry DID SOMEBODY JUST SAY A TANK!

So a army tank is faster than a mustang?

Superman

The most romantic scene in movie history

I wonder what the chemical composition of Love is on the periodic table of elements? Any guesses...

This would be stupid even in a superhero movie

First of all, he didn&#39;t have as much speed when he shifted from forward to sideways, because the car was still moving mostly forward. He had mostly forward momentum so he wouldn&#39;t have hit the car that hard, but he definitely would&#39;ve gotten hurt. Second of all, the amount of forward momentum he had would&#39;ve been plenty to overcome the gravity for enough time to get across.

I don&#39;t buy that 😂

Dom was lucky there was a car conveniently parked on his landing spot to break his fall. Otherwise he and Letty would have been splattered all over the road. 😂

The stupid subtitles.
Perfect

<a href="">2:10</a>

Physics left the chat

Fast And Furious Six ?

I remember watching this at the movies and the whole theater just stood up hands on they head all together and said “OHHHH” like a choir and started clapping when they were safe

Risk modhl Dom
Pinche churazo😂

Newton never sacrifice his virginity just to discovered Gravity.

Warning: kids do not try this at home. The results will not be the same.

tried this my girl

It&#39;s possible in real life .I do catch things in mid air while moving.Yeah ! Of course I never tried on bridge.But him measuring the intercepting point and the right momentum is more astonishing.And one more thing,Movies aren&#39;t to be taken literally.

It’s crazy how his shirt got more crisp after the hitting the window If this doesn’t prove that vin diesel isn’t Mr.Clean idk what will

Best scen ever
this scene was inspired by a real incident that happened in 1995 see Shawn Nelson

Newton who ?

Physics: ight imma head out

I think this might be the exact moment the series completely lost its mind

THESE TYPES OF MOVIES ARE FOR TEENAGERS AND DUMB YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVE HORRIBLE VIOLENT MOVIES. LMFAOO 😂😂😂😂😂😂

~fast and furious exist~Physical rules:Am I joke to you

Am I the only one that cringed when that beautiful charger just got totalled to save a girl that doesn’t even remember him?

even bangladeshi movies r more realistic than this

Imagine if Paul was still alive

This really bugging me her names lenny not letty

mad max

<a href="">0:00</a> there is tofaş
<a href="">2:31</a> people in gta v when they crash be like

<a href="">1:07</a> I love this moment.

Him catching letty is what did it for me. Right when this scene happened, these movies became stupid James Bond type lol

Are we seriously sure this is not part of the MU or DCEU...? Like seriously - they can&#39;t be human at this point right...? 😂😂

Mantav lur!!
That escort 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
We all know Redick came back to earth that’s why he could do that

Next thing is Dom would be the next avenger having phenomenal superpowers🤣🤣

Speer Speer Dom with another speer

Now this aged like a fine wine!

Dom get out the car jump cross the brigets and saved letty life its was awesome

This is the worst of all F&amp;F movies.

RIP Paul walker

If you want to become One with your girl, try this at home...you’ll become one chunk of meat😂

how cool was dom flying threw the air like that

This is my all time favourite scene from the FF series so far...

That lighting is so inconsistent though. Jeez.

I would have given Goldberg spear to Letty for more safe landing..

-there are fly now?-there are fly now.

Jibba liba this movie really came out in 2013?

Well in this case.. Where was Dom when Thanos almost wiped out the universe my boy Dom let iron man die

These MF bout to have scoliosis and herniated discs.

I like that saving her scene

No one will be seated as Don defies every one of the natural laws to catch his girlfriend

I just noticed that <a href="">1:58</a> there’s a pole that the rope completely passes through somehow

It’s a good idea, I liked it
<a href="">1:07</a> god i miss that smile😭💔

So realistic

The intensity in this scene. One of the greatest scenes ever, whether it&#39;s unrealistic or not.

THE ONLY REASON I WATCH THIS SERIES IS FOR PAUL WALKER AND TYRESE!! BIG FACTS

Am i the only one that its hurts me seeing the Daytona get destroyed like that

I just Loved It 👏👏👏😍
This is stretching the laws of physics but Dom would be able to move through the air horizontally perhaps not to this extent because he would still be moving with the momentum of the car, as the force of the wall acts only on the car not on Dom himself. It doesn&#39;t completely defy the laws of physics but it does stretch them quite a bit

Seems legit
Don’t worry his back is made of rock.

<a href="">1:07</a>  huhu:(
Phew! Thank God that white Tee stayed clean!

Honestly, I don&#39;t care about realism in action movies, the thing is that these movies are making everything way too dramatical and sad, rather than.. I don&#39;t know, enjoyable ?Don&#39;t mind me, I do love dramatic movies, but only when they&#39;re good lol

Joe taslim from indonesia🇮🇩

When I was watching this movie in theater, I didn’t think FF would top this scene..... then the fast 9 trailer dropped and I saw the web slinging car itself.

At that speed both of them should of went through the entire car .... and still die

Wow. Thisbis so bad

Tried this with my girl, we&#39;re in heaven now

The most underrated fast and furious movie.

can’t wait to see how “realistic” the new one is

Miss Paul Walker
The stupidest scene in the universe
How a flat car knocked a tank

Legs would have shatter and he would have broker many bones or even have killed her as soon as they touched 😆 then the window of the car would have Shattered

who do Indonesian people like!!!
Director: &quot;How much bullshit do you want in this scene?&quot;Actors: &quot;Yes&quot;

its the greatest &#39;yeah right&#39; moment ever... its impossible but awesome

<a href="">1:56</a> see there is a big post or something idk what you call it, how come the cable get pass thru that? O.o

F&amp;F series was over for me when this scene came on.. Dumbest movie clip ever, its Bollywood bad

Not long ago I was blaming bollywood for physics

Football catch wòooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵
I’d never seen a Fast and Furious movie before this, but I was dragged to the theatre. After this I watched all of them the next weekend. Love these movies❤️

I think newton turned in his grave during this scene

Bullshit sceneOmg.It was at this moment When nobody knew toretto.had super powers😂🤣🤣🤣

Everything in this scene is totally possible ....

Fast and furious 9 - the family vs Goku.

I remember this scene, everyone in the movie theater clapped when dom saved letty

<a href="">0:54</a> Everybody keeps saying that was 100% bullshit, But it honestly doesn’t look like something too far fetched

Lol ppl always bring up physics like WOW WE ARE NOT DUMB‼️... like damn if movies followed the laws of physics half of the time most would b boring everyone turning physicists in comments🤣

Aaron Ramsey’ll need to retire his goal killed Paul

Oh my God.....*shakes head* wow. That was stupid. They&#39;d all be dead.

And I remember when Dom barely survived the crash at the end of the first movie

That catch though 🖖

Nope. Nope. Nope.Nope.

That&#39;s love frfr

Anyone watching this in 2019?

The sigh at the end is heartwarming

no cap that was a awesome save ngl

I really like the chager i made it in gta oh by the way the  Physics are real the speed of chager powered dom the engry of him sent him flying and letty oh the hit from the glass he Can   Actually  survie it sorry for my spelling but he can survie if you dint see fast and forious 5 dom fought hops aka the rock so he tookAll those punches from the rock he should survie a hit from glass on his spine ok im tired of tiying guys

Indonesian people like!!!
Why was she working with Shaw in the first place

<a href="">2:40</a> That had to hurt his back.

He should be dead even at 30k per hour you will die

I laughed so hard when I first saw this scene

<a href="">2:40</a> when i need to go at school

I am annoyed because the window didn’t break

Give Torretto a car and he can do literally everything 😂😂

The physics is bonkers let me explain if the destroyed car that fell and hit the pole that holds the bridge would not shake the bridge and destroy the tank the car would of gotten more destroyed and when he saved lenny the momentum would of crushed the heck out of her and when he crashed into the window he would of went through it because of the speed and probleby killed him

<a href="">2:30</a> LMAO😂😂🤣
<b>Isaac Newton left the theater</b>

No Brian...NO!!!THAT ESCORT IS VALUABLE!! DON&#39;T DAMAGE IT

This is so boring.

Newton : do my theories r joke to u

2 Hearts
I remember watching this in the movie theater and he saved letty everybody was like woooooooooooow, I just laughed

man they have safety issues doors are not locked <a href="">1:06</a>

Great pancakes! How did you make them... tank+car

Seedy gangster garbage warping young minds ,should be banned

Idk why y&#39;all are complaining it&#39;s a MOVIE. If it was normal who would&#39;ve watch it ?

What is the song when Dom and Letty are on the car

hello toreto and letti and brayan 😉😊😋😄😏🤗🤗🤗
When Bob plays madden 247 with odell Beckham jr

Too much trivial stuff

They should replace vind diesel with ken Jeong. That scene would of been so much better.

Dom👀👀👀Who speaks Afrikaans here?
Wait I thought Groot, Xander Cage, and Iron Giant were his only superhero characters?

The same people complaining about this are the people who unironically enjoy movies about space wizards with glow sticks that come out every December.

Would’ve been funny if it ended with dom moaning, my back..my back...

<a href="">1:29</a> Gta 5 logic

I love when dom saves Letty❤️❤️

Completely ridiculous

DCEU has to recast vin diesel as superman
Edris: im black supermanDiesel: im soon superman
I don&#39;t care how ridiculous it is, it&#39;s still epic.

Letty: &quot;Dude, enough already...would you guys just leave me alone!? I still dont remember any of you&#39;s&quot;

In which part they got married?

Superman

KAY
This is relationship goals

Wait do you get it Lenny did a different team and then dom did that

It was this scene i gave up on fast and furious movies

And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is how Dom broke his back.

In Furious 9 they will probably team up with the Autobots and fight the Decepticons

When I saw this part I was ready to walk out. My dad saw this when it aired on Tv he walked out the living room lol

<a href="">2:35</a>, I got goosebumps

U have to be healthy as hell to  catch and land perfectly after u smashed ur spine on a window shield

This is where I stopped watching. What kinda nonsense is this?! Who the hell was the director for this? Agnes from despicable me...guy let his imagination run wild

Did anyone notice the mustang cable passed through a concrete pillar in the divide between the carriageways

I saw this in theaters and some old lady yelled out &quot;Oh come on!&quot;It was quite funny

chills literal chills

cinemasins

like avengers but with cars

I don&#39;t understand people getting angry at the utterly bonkers physics of this series. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re making Titanic, they&#39;re not bound to make a film that&#39;s true to reality.These films have always been dumb fun popcorn movies. Fast 5 was where they really hit their stride, when they embraced how nuts the series was and went all in on being insane.These are the sort of films where you just turn your brain off and enjoy some muscular oiled men punching each other in the head and flipping cool cars for a couple of hours.

What happened to dodge charger Daydona 🤔 he&#39;s steal another one that&#39;s for sure it cost a lot of money to buy it 😬

it was at this point where the rock thought he might lose his role as black adam

In this scene they don&#39;t use FX or stunt actors only use Vin Diesel

Was Dominick a few inches taller than his actor?

First letty betrays the group then get back. Then in Fate of the furious dom betrays the group and then gets back in the group.

Roman&#39;s car couldn&#39;t go under bridge if it wasn&#39;t about &quot;videoshop&quot; . anyone noticed that ?

I feel sad for that W124

Yes I want to be your next movie my brother

This scene is so unrealistically stupid but amazingly epic lol i will love all of these movies forever

Bullshit movie. Too fake

l&#39;

in the movie theater everyone started clappin at dis scene lmao

Shouldn&#39;t an impact like that hurt him and knock the wind out of him

<a href="">2:36</a>

WTF LMAO

ffs

Newton: Saving Letty was impossible, don&#39;t you have any gravity? Dominic: I don&#39;t have gravity... I got family

The unrealistic bullshit vin diesel make dom do is stupid. We get it. You&#39;re jealous  of the rock taking your thunder. Get over it!

When this happened at the theater everyone was laughing lmao.

Deam

How did Dom not get paralysed there? His back must be made of titanium...

Dom's back didn't hurt after taking a tremendous hit with the glass. O:
hello

Heyyyy it was patricja
this is stupid

Fuck, what the fuck!

What a bullshit scene

The new fast and furious / Matrix multiverse.

This scene ilustrates love and mechanism of relationships. Very deep.

How are all his ribs not broken from impact

One of the best scene in fast and furious

Brian:cars don&#39;t flyNewton:men don&#39;t fly
After this scene Dom can pass as a Avenger.

Complaining about physics? What about all the bullshit dom survives throughout the franchise?

Gay Arab, please give me a like

<a href="">2:38</a>

Kkhheeee!!!! Kkhheeee!!!!
IMHO this was where they blew the movie....I know no one watches these movies for their realism but seriously 🙄

I am a physics graduate. This is torture 😭😭😭

The way how Dom took that impact on that windshield, it&#39;s exactly how most of us men take the impact everyday though life to provide for our family.. great scene👊😎

The way Dom loved Letty, reinforce the theory (true love is blind)

Vin diesel is my favorite dude in this movie from Rp3

It's impossible
They killing all the civilians.

Ruin your day over this scene
Ya

Ahhahahahahahah

My frnds and me sitting on the theatre ..when Venn diesel jump .suddenly we all just stand in our sit and just can&#39;t explain the feelings ..😂😂 only Goosebumps.

¡Amazing!   toreto
That was logical

Physics was at Smoko during this time 🤦🏼‍♂️
Ok this scene is bullshit, what was wrong with first 4 movies which didnt have science fiction parts?

Ah, good (●´ω｀●)Thanks God
After the scene when Dom catches Letty is the point where I stopped watching the Fast movies

okay now y&#39;all are just mad f*cking greedy, this is a Hollywood movie so this doesn&#39;t need to be real just like how it&#39;s not real when they can just rob a millionaire, stop a tank with just car&#39;s, let alone a giant airplane, stop a small army with the help of a secret oraganization, have a gods eye, fight and defeat a high ranking british soldier just by kicking the ground to make him fall in it, steal the key to launch a nuclear bomb with the help of that small army that blackmails people and then stop a f*cking submarine by making it target at the MC to later get it hit the submarine.... it all doesn&#39;t make sense but they were all badass when you first saw it and you know it was. edit: it&#39;s stupid but it was BADASS

Let&#39;s face it... Dominic is <i>The Chosen One</i>

<a href="">0:04</a> Oh look, I’m bored.

<a href="">0:37</a> that car is on sale in gta online 600 k

He was a wide receiver

haha simple calculations it could work, though it is a movie, but  the  force of   dominic from his car  crash actually push him forward,but where   you land  after catching her in mid Air, absolutely no idea, any parkour in the house

I thought this is fast and furious not tanks and furious?

Dom got Superman&#39;s power!

Hey

So the dislikes are because of physics... So what&#39;s the point in watching a modern day action movie if you want realism? Or any movie for that matter

Touchdown 😭

Rip Paul walker

<a href="">0:55</a> Guy in the car: My leg!

<a href="">2:37</a> there in no way he could have timed that perfectly

Lmao

incredible
I love this movie.

Actually, given that Dom must weigh at least twice as much as Letty and is moving a lot faster it&#39;s not beyond the realms of possibilty that his sideways momentum would be enough to cancel out hers.Did anyone else notice that in the wide shot when Dom takes flight, he does so BEFORE his car hits the rail?

to this day one of my favorite action movie scenes ... go big or go home

Is he toredo or superman

2.35 to 2.38 what's the matter? I enjoyed watching this scene.
That was cool

Wawe super

<a href="">2:39</a> the car hit the iron bar twice# When Dom jump<a href="">#And</a> when dom was &quot;flying&quot; to take letty, more precisium is at <a href="">2:39</a>

The &#39;Stang knows how it feels 2 get tailgated by a Volvo!

Cool

I always thought it was a scene from the first Fast N Furious movie, how silly of me 😋😋😋 !!!!

ohhh good
jajajaja I like the idea of smooth voice.....😉😉😉

First letty betrays dom, now dom betraying her.

When he shifts gear and blazes off the camera

I mean seriously?

Wow

So many good cars ruined for a shitty action film series. Hope they all suffer the same fate as Paul.

Why do I feel like this franchise hates Mustangs?

bnm

you should do a movie about Fast and Furious 2001

If you watch these movies as superhero movies, they become way better.

Excellent, but for the expected fall, you're too cool torrwro dude, because this is a mild word that hurts no matter what you are, even if you're a badass. But be careful, for me this is the best bible ever made, full of messages and the essence of life. ... FAITH, LOVE OF FAMILY while doing what you do best. WAITING FOR PART 9.
Plymouth Superbird, or Dodge Daytona?

IRL, this wouldn’t have happened. Dom was at least going 60 mph on the bridge. A 1000lb car couldn’t stop a 2 ton tank. The rate of speed dom was going couldn’t have intersected letty safety enough for them to land on a car. The amount of force of impact they had would’ve broke the windshield completely. In IRL, that would’ve sent dom flying over the other bridge and they would’ve died, tragically. I know it’s a movie, but come on guys.....

Beautiful
Why does Dodge Charger and Challenger was the best cars than Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro in Fast and Furious? Why?

This was when I had to let the franchise go.. I guess I&#39;m too old and outgrew it

That&#39;s crazy stuff.
