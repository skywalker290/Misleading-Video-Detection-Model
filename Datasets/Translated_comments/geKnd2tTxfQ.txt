She did not die it is just a rumor so stop believing this shit. And gosh her sucks it almost made me deaf

This is a Fake Rumor Thisb Person Just Hates Her

just notice how she prounce letter T . its still the same , and even how she raises her right hand every performance . she&#39;s now 31 . she can&#39;t stay to that 17 years old attitude of hers at her age now .

avie is not dead and she did not retouch why if she was replaced by a lookalike the talent is not imitated

avril lavigne is not dead I saw a video  of her saying  that it is a fake she is alive

she&#39;s not dead okey -.- wondering why she changed? like an app on ur phone every month week or year they update just like her she improved herself she upgraded herself that&#39;s why u think she was dead because she chaged and didn&#39;t get old...it&#39;s my opinion by the way...

does she realy died and how??? 

OMG the person singing just SHUT UP!! You can not sing!!!

she&#39;s alive

I like old Avril. Look at her eyes. Omg

Rip Avril Lavigne I&#39;m a fan of u I&#39;ll miss u  forever I love u!! it&#39;s so sad to know that  you&#39;re dead good bye

I totally belive the real Avril died after her first album

Did this predict Leonard Nemoys death?.. Because this was posted two months before he died .
