I think there should be security personals  near by such large carnivores to avoid such incidents infuture,  I can&#39;t blame the Tiger though he didn&#39;t eat him he was strangled to death bcz it is his territory such a shame for Zoo mgmt...not only for Tiger ,Lion, Lepoard, Crocodile don&#39;t provoke them or feed them they are unpredictable in behaviour...

They only know how to cut a zoo entry ticket... So your life is only in your hands...

You can save us as a man, but you can make everyone laugh or make a video or throw stones, you can remove the rope from the back.
Who is responsible

The Tiger never showed aggression,  when he carried the man away he broke the man&#39;s neck when he started running. He never intentionally killed the man though.

anybody who is been to India understand how most of the people act in emergency cases

September 23, 2016

It shouldn&#39;t be possible for people to jumpThey should make it tall and locked

I heard the tiger had an upset stomach I heard the tiger had an upset stomach, Because he couldn&#39;t digest spicy food

Mr. Ball
I went to the same zoo day before this incident took place and I saw the tiger and it was really calm

<a href="">1:59</a> Is she saying that it should not be possible for a human to jump over that little fence ? Haha

Tiger did it like a champBroke his neck and gave him a fast death ✌

MURDER saw another video with him at the zoo under control of security! They put him in to be killed !

My only question is how da hell did he fall????

If you want to look at it more sentimentally the Tiger was probably curious as to who this new person was in his enclosure then when people started throwing things at the tiger the tiger thought his new friend was in danger and tried to carry him to safety. Just you know probably too much to ask for but don’t want to rule it out

Yet the tiger has probably had its life token away for doing what it was created to do after this person stupid mistake

Ow my god
In the first place leave the animals in thier natural habitat human are do cruel i cant blame the tiger we should leave the nature in thier natural home not cqptivate

This lady should go and train all those guards rather complaining about this.

It was already bad idea to climb down in the the tiger&#39;s enclosure, but then Hadji thought he would entertain Mr. Tiger with the mouse dance...

White Tiger: Time to be deceased boy

Yes throwing stones at an aggressive tiger is so fucking smart

Omg

Blaming all zoo authority without their mistake ,he was not kid to slipped out. He was mentally upset.

Where was quick response team?

As long as they didnt kill the tiger after this incident then im happy. Jump in with a wild animal, be prepared to lose your life.

15 minutes to respond???? Unbelievable

CLOSE ALLL ZOOS

That&#39;s what he gets!!!

Sooo bad new yr
The Tiger was from RSS.!

There is no need to talk...the same human being has killed 10,000 human beings, he has offered to eat...can one idiot kill just one person? neither does anyone give nor feels his pain
Guys , first the tiger was gone away silently then the peoples thew rocks to the tiger so the tiger though that the man is also going to hurt the tiger . If the peoples did not threw rocks the man would be alive

u

He was my friend

Guy died on purpose

This is not a mistake of tiger peoples are throwing a stones on tiger

Painful way to suicide

A cure for mental illness.

Tiger ka kya kasoor  jo gira huse samaj ne chaiye tha

What happened to the drunkard, the poor widow?
Violent

Why did he jump over the gate 🚷think please ❔

rap song.             R I P R I P em yeah they say ahhh then there dead

Thank god it wasn’t a black man because that tiger would have gotten high Cholesterol

Omg

i bet i was planning to suicide thats why

Peaceful community - &quot;Ye sher RSS ka agent hai&quot;

I still feel bad for the tiger

Nice job tiger for killing a chutiya.
Lol 1- filthy human
People should maintain calm to let the tiger goes.. Due to stupidy of the people, tiger got fear and took the man and finally tiger crushed the neck and not for eating..

The man’s fault

security have been alert

Now this is what I call &quot; enrichment &quot; .......

I still say the morons who threw the stones were the ones actually responsible for the death. Tiger wasn&#39;t attacking till then. It was at most alert and curious....and there was a good chance of distracting it away or something at the very least.But no! What do f*<b>***</b> idiots do? Throw stones. It&#39;s a WILD CREATURE. Pain = attack = agression. It reacted as expected!It saw something unfamiliar, it got attacked, and corelated it to the &#39;threat&#39; by attacking the unfamiliar thing.Poor man. Let down by fellow humans with no brains...

The man is to blame. The tiger was following instinct. They don&#39;t think, it didn&#39;t do it on purpose. Plus, HE JUMPED IN WHAT DID HE EXPECT TO HAPPEN

HAHAHAHAHAHA

showing fire flames might have helped. stones wont. atleast if sand sprayed

fool guards

Tiger ko shoot krna chahiye tha

two things are their,why hindhi news media,NDTV reporter ,talking in english, media should give report in hindhi langugageand second thing is thisye ladka maksood,jisko tiger ne maara hai, iska back ground pata chala ki,is maksood muslim ladke ne he ,devi durga maa k murti par mars(non-veg) k piece fekhe the, hindhu k aastha kharaab karne k liye , is liye abhi aap khud samajgae honge aakhir ye maksood tiger k haatho kyu maara gayalakin ye maksood ka background madarchod media walo ne nahi bataya

it&#39;s not funny imagine that was you i bet you wouldn&#39;t laugh

Yes u can be blamed didn&#39;t you know it&#39;s always someone else&#39;s fault! Persons are never responsible for their own actions anymore ! Having said that ... build a fence with barbwire on top like they do in the western world nobody gets into lion or tiger dens here! Anyone who try&#39;s to will get trapped on the fence! Not everybody is mentally fit for the world , &amp; somebody should have been caring for this person. But a fence like I described would have kept him out! Back in the 80&#39;s we had some low fences like you , same thing happened. Except it was a little boy who fell in with polar bears .. he survived. So our people dealt with this issue never to have a problem again! Amen

Rip for that boy....N ya he should climb that wall he did his silly mistake but there was time to him at lest   ten or 15 minutes N in dat tme the zoo workers can easily shoot to make dat tiger immediately faint..they should keep all the vital equipments for dis kind of sudden incident after all Delhi is rajdhani capital...

IF 2 TO 3 PEOPLE JUMP THEN THE MAN CAN SAVE

so fucking dumb LUL
i came to watch someone get killed by a tiger

Okay so let me get this straight:Animal kills human Everybody: Insticts, nature, blah blah... What a stupid human. Naaw he&#39;s hungry..Human kills animalEverybody: FUCK YOU OMG YOU FREAKING BITCH WHY THE HELL IT WAS JUST A FUCKIN&#39; ANIMAL YOU MONSTER HOPE YOU&#39;LL ROTTEN IN HELL FUCK YOU I HATE YOU sad but true. plz don&#39;t answer i&#39;m to lazy anyways... peace or whatevs.

the reporter is so loud

how is this unsuitible for children you dont see fuck all

<a href="">0:40</a> Unimaginable, if it wasnt for these pictures...Not sure if pun intended or not

Ok it&#39;s not the tigers fault at all, first it was the idiots fault jumping into the dang cage but what were the workers doing they couldve done something to possibly save his life.

Why is he flailing his arms? Is that because they claim he&#39;s mentally unstable?

Who&#39;s to blame? Definitely not the tiger.

its not the tigers fault he jumped in and the tiger thought that he was food

I can watch I&#39;m 6 years old

just because he was muslim nobody came to help him

dont fuckin blur it and say its not suitable for children

why is it always white people? us black people got some sense

Onlookers and the guys fault. If you&#39;re that stupid to jump inside that in closure and then people throw stones, honestly as a tiger I&#39;d be pissed too.

that alot of curry for one tiger digest...but so sad r.i.p

THE ARSE OF THE TIGER STILL BURNING ,,,,, i think the tiiger was just hungry coz not much money in india to feed peopel let alone animals , no wonder it was hingry ... meanwhile indian army boough 200 extra unnecesararly  costly unusable fightyer jets and weapons .. biggets weapons buyer adn agressor in world , cant feed its peopel which are worlds pooresty .. sucked dry by our hindu army stealing money .

Doesn&#39;t Matter if that boy was drunk or tried to commit suicide.... what matter is the authority didn&#39;t do anything to save that boy..... &quot;15Min&quot; for &#39;&#39;15Min&#39;&#39; he wasn&#39;t attacked.....He could have saved by shooting tiger from tranquilizer.... All people come up with idea of throwing rocks

that&#39;s all the guys fault

That was his fault.

throwing rocks at him .......................... your a fuckin idiot

Why did he even jump in there

<a href="">4:20</a> long B)
calm down dude

DON&#39;T BLAME THE TIGER  BLAME THE STUPID  HUMAN
GUYS! LETS THROW ROCKS AT THE TIGER TO PROVOKE IT TO GET AWAY FROM THE GUY! THAT WILL WORK RIGHT?!?

100 people die in a minute this was one of them.

why did they not kill the tiger with a gun like one of the videos i have watched it was a girella

&quot;Ahduuuhhh ahduuuu&quot;
I think zoos should make visitors sign a paper saying that they can&#39;t sue and will not be saved if they fall or climb into an exhibit

i cant watch this...because of the accents

Umm... Do something? Anything?

R.I.P headphone users

Workers in zoo is stupid. Just be smart and throw some fresh bloody meat towards this tiger immediately to save this man.

This is bogus man

the man who threw the stone should be in jail

One less person in the world. And possibly, one less tiger. What a moron.

Don&#39;t climb in the tiger domain and you won&#39;t get eaten ..simple

that guy was in the pit for at least 10 minutes(alive).....

why didn&#39;t the zoo do anything to save him? do they honestly not have a protocol for emergency situations? how sad.

why didn&#39;t the zoo do anything to save him? do they honestly not have a protocol for emergency situations? how sad.

Something is going to kill us one day but this is a bad way to go.

did the man die

Given that he wasn&#39;t mentally well, the zoo really should have better security measures to ensure none of the visitors, mentally well or not, are safe. They didn&#39;t respond for 15 minutes and there was hardly anything stopping people from falling in, intentionally or not.

Why are most of you just making silly comments about this serious video? I know that that man was a dumba** for falling into the pen, but you have to be more serious about peoples lives. Imagine if you were that situation, would you like people making stupid comments about it?

These people are so fucking stupid.....throwing stones to a tiger that clearly is just curious and isn&#39;t doing anything bad. I mean really? How come am I always right thinking that these people have an underdeveloped brain?

that we so scary

That tiger got a nice indian take away.

Had he bit the Tigers nose.. He might still be here today winkwink

what the?

what i find fascinating is the tiger didn&#39;t attack for 10 or 15 minutes.

MA nigga <a href="">1:21</a>
Lol oh well He shouldn&#39;t have been leaning that far into the cage 

Where are the stones?

You have 2 blame the man,he wad an idiot anf jumped over the gate into the pit abd you cant blame the tiger for being a tiger

You oppress us , we will oppress you.

I&#39;m sure if you were kept in a cage/limited space you would have done the same thing.

I&#39;m no animal expert but i can&#39;t blame the tiger for that person&#39;s death Most wild animals in captivity suffer mentally and it&#39;s only natural that they try to kill any intruder who enter their territory.

Did he taste like curry?

Darwin award.

As horrible as this may sound, the tiger has instincts on hunting. I agree it sucked that the tiger killed the man it&#39;s just like a cat killing their prey. 

Holy.....shit oh my god... :(
Why don't those standing on the sidelines help?
Why nobody help

Throw stones at him?!!I would get angry too..

so bad
Plz guys, if ever it happens like this, please tell the members of the zoo.. They will at least help... There is no use in judging them..
Holy fuck tigers are big. Just carries him off in his mouth

They didn&#39;t have to feed the tiger that day

Actually the tiger tried to save the man from the distracted people who just throw stones , sticks and shouts at them, by holding the neck just like the tiger hold its cubbies and tried to take him (victim) to a safe place but it doesn&#39;t worked out due to the over weight of the victim the tiger holds his neck hardly which made..............

where are the zoo incharge that time

 Maybe we should create a government agency to educate people on the risks of jumping into a tiger enclosure and to make sure  people from the agency randomly inspect every zoo in the country to enforce strict laws and controls on animal enclosures and add piles of tedious paper work to be filled out by the zoo and the inspector.  That way we can make sure everyone loses, another inefficient government agency soaking up tax dollars, more red tape and bureaucracy making it harder for anyone to do anything, more expensive zoo visits and finally a big ugly fence obstructing the view of the animals..... great idea people. 

May his soul rest in peace. I do feel bad for him and do not wish to insult him. But what was he thinking?? He crossed a barrier and then made enough moves to climb down/ fall into this enclosure. He died because of his own actions. Yes the guards could have done better, but after he entered that enclosure he was just asking to get lucky. Cant be an expectation on the part of people like him to be saved after trying to pull a stunt like that. Again, sorry for sounding harsh. But anyone watching this - DONT try it !! Also can&#39;t blame the people for trying to throw stones. A less hungry animal might have walked away from all the trouble. This one decided to take the meal to go.

The zoo cant be to blame. Any rational human would understand the dangers of the situation. This situation panned out exactly as it should have.

At that point the zoo coyld have done so much but they did nothing , theirs tranquilizers, trained caregivers, and ultimately guns. But nothing was used to help people tried throwing stones but it made it worse. Here the zoo is probably 85%-90% at fault.

No Richard Parker
As per me the zoo guards should be blamed I think you ppl should take desigion in putting cemras in the zoo R.I.P poor guy how sad

That tiger wouldn&#39;t have had a chance because know Karate

All the other guards were probably watching the cobras getting the crap slapped out of them.

Hahaha... You stupid guards..all guards should get punishment in the same way.. 

Hahaha... You stupid guards..all guards should get punishment in the same way.. 

dump standby people who yelling and throwing stuff to the tiger that make tiger nervous and angry and where is the Zoo guard in that almost 15 minutes ?

Cut there was a chance of pounding her later he he

Wow now the officials say he had been drinking? I doubt he was drinking, they are just trying to cover up on this incident 

WHY no zoo keeper officers to help? Why took so long for the zoo keeper to come?!??!!

How stupid

And nobody jumped in...

This was a disturbing incident. The Zoo officials should put higher fence such that Visitors can&#39;t climb over into the non safety zone.
