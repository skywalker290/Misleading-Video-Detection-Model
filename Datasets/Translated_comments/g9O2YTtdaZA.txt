Can someone in the comments explain to me what the song that starts at <a href="">1:47</a> is called?

Sure was a flop

It was very generous of them to allow at least one or two of the child heroes to be white males.

Missy is such a good leader 

Priyanka ️
Hindi dubbed please
Priyanka Chopra acting super
Really you can&#39;t find any other actress then this Indian slut Priyanka

Glad to know this movie, even though it is very late, my children love this movie so much

Movie was fantastic ...I love it ....you must watch this

Anyone hear of the sequel coming out I think next year?

Guys! It&#39;s for kids. It&#39;s a small budget movie. Stop comparing every movie with Avengers! It&#39;s made for specific audience. Chill

They should have play David Bowie&#39;s song

Very bad bad don&#39;t see this video it&#39;s bad xcsbad

Bad

Bad bad don&#39;t see this video please

Very bad stopid worst

its kid movie  and kids enjoyed it

this film I guess was meant to be released as a TV Series but by mistake got Netflix Rights

This movie is bad, like bad bad 

If Pedro Pascal Does Not Laugh Then Cry I won&#39;t watch this movie

how to be a actor in Netflix (someone in sri lanka ) please reply for me Netflix please I like be a actor in Netflix but I am sri Lankan  please say Netflix

how to be a actor in Netflix (someone in sri lanka ) please

This was the most jumbled clusterfuck of a movie i have ever seen. First of all the powers they have are so overpowered 99 percent of the problems they face make no sense because they could easily solve it using their powers. Also, the ending is just a fucking mess(its a plot twist revealing literally the entire movie was absolutely fucking useless as it was part of some plan)

Ah, yes, teamwork. I&#39;m sure the adult heroes had no concept of this.

Basically bnha

Why would you do this movie pedroooo 

Ep   2

How to watch full movie in hindi
Somebody know the song?

Everyone else: Awesome, Sharkboy and Lavagirl sequelMe: If Sharkboy can&#39;t touch Lavagirl, how did they have a kid together?

Rubbish
childrens are in more demand than priyanka chopra 

<a href="">1:24</a> to protect ur butts when u hit the ground

I want to watch we can be heroes full movie pls.

Is this movie inspired from Indian movies and the vfx too 

roar!!!!!!!!

Did i see the whole movie in this trailer itself? 

I think you guys need to see the movie

Too child
This movie is just another version of shark boy and lava girl

Missy should be Lavagirls daughter

Bruh missy is the worst leader there could be the only thing she has is team work and she does not have one power and she just stands there and let’s everyone do stuff for her

Im sorry, god what is this. &quot;Lavagirl&quot;. I remember watching this movie. They tried so hard to be the avengers...

How priyanka Chopra promoted this movie like shes in the main lead role. After watching this trailer I found out shes nothing more than a side piece Not even very relevant tbh

All Hollywood movies have same Content Destroy World and in the end Save World 

Cringe
I have watched many movies in my life and i can tell you this without doubt THISISTHE WORSTMOVIEIHAVEEVERWATCHEDIN MY ENTIRE LIFE

I knew it , i have a doubt of was it priyanka because i just finished watching the movie 

Not good movie

I have seen this movie  10 times it is so good 

MHA: am I a joke to you??

Coppyright owner Avengers 
Minecraft strong hold lol

Ah...this super powers of super hero can&#39;t be natural ...but the aliens which will be able to come here will be 100% powerful and more advanced than us...then what

Wish there was another movie of we can be heroes

Name the movie

Pause at <a href="">2:15</a>

Pls give me movie

Why this Indian actor doing here why

Shark boy and lava girl was best movie

The most illogical movie/series after marvel

Agent Murphy and Javier Pena on the house 

english krrish
Ban priyanka chopra

I relly like like the movie I watch it every day and right now I am

Kinda cringe ngl
Omfg it&#39;s so cringe  I know it&#39;s for small children but still...

I watched it once. Like if i was 8 years younger i would&#39;ve liked it but i just cant enjoy this movie

Can you upload the full movie of this in YouTube Please i really love this show / movie

I just remember my hero academia when I saw this what abt you?

Looks like pena left dea and went to be a hero with murphy

How to download 

I got goosebumps 
I see the movie is soo cool

No

Am I the only one who ships Missy and wild Card

When will this realising in YouTube?

Stop making these type of movies aliens come eat everybody then agents come people say that you are not going anywhere then we will save the world stupid things

It was such a mind blowing movie

Agent Pena and Agent Murphy ? what are you doing there?

the graphics in this movie just make me wanna cry

Wheels is not smart

What a piece of 

Another pandemic 

Save the world! George Carlin

I don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t use David Bowie&#39;s &quot;Heroes&quot;. It&#39;s literally one of the best songs ever and has the title of this film in it multiple times.

1 hour totally tortured on my eyes ‍️‍️‍️‍️

this was the worst thing ive ever watched

I wish I was an young hero with electric blades

Pc my fav 
Stretching girl totally originalSharkgirl I guess totally original &quot;H&quot; headquarters design totally original Movie concept totally original

Anoycyd software r,dvdyevegevevudeydhw
I love how they turned the comments off all trailers so us trolls wouldn’t be in the comments emphasizing how cringe it is.  Yea it is a children’s movie but like the original Sharkboy n lava girl, spy kids 1234, was 100x better

Dominique botha is. Djjfnhhfn djiJdmndhyUcnd9D

Dominique
I love the Idea of Ojo being Missy’s Rival

READY

from narcos heheh

The movie of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is 10 times better than this, like if you think the same

I watch the full movie of this 10 times

I love this movie

I saw this 10000 times  I like it

Wish they had better CGI.

What da fuq is this ?

Its so fucking discussting and so unrealistic movie

Believe it or not, a 100 % natural treatment solution from Dr. Ikpoko on YouTube could help you to get rid of herpes permanently.

Dug durggjdn
Love your movie

Wow what a movie
No wonder Shark Boy never talks... he is literally in pain every single day.....

Can&#39;t wait for the razzle guys to get drunk and watch this

The cgi omg

Avengers but it&#39;s KIDZ BOP

All this criticism towards a talented actress who is Indian. How come no other actor with different ethnicity gets judged for it? Finally a role that isn&#39;t a stereotypically east indian. There isn&#39;t alot of roles for east Indians in most films internationally. Yea, she finally represents east Indians in western culture. I would say the movie is more inclusive and open-minded

I have watched the full movie on NetflixIt was awesome And it has many suspense in last

Great! Movie Scripts were amazing Hats off to all characters I want a series of this

<a href="">1:07</a> guys who has seen family reunion it is Shaca and Brooke

omg I js=ust fishned the movie you should make pt 2 loved it ps im his child lol im a girl

I just wanna say the actors who played Javier pena and steven murphy in narcos were so badass and then they came to this biggest downgrade in history

I love you..............................................nitu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not worth seeing guys. Very bad movie despite what the trailer shows.

I am very glad to tell you m here sfter wasting my 2hrs+ on this usless ,boaring ,dumb movie
This Is bullshit.

how did they make a kid

Lol what

This movie sucked, I’m not talking about bad movie this, it’s a “bottle sucked CLEAN” movie.

Who came from Tik Tok?
I liked the movie but there is no logic tbh.I’m giving it 5.9/10

It’s basically a western style my hero academia ripoff

Seems like that this is a &quot;we have avangers at home hunny&quot; - (ofc it&#39;s from mom)

I love this 

Herpes can be cured permanently, I got rid of my HSV with the help of Dr Gani contact him for any health issues via WhatsApp +2348118778806

We Can Be Hereos

We Can Be Heoros

Yay! Whistler awesome  buddy....
<a href="">1:45</a> I like that word

Me: mom I wanna watch The AvengersMom: We have The Avengers at home.The Avengers at home.....

The film is very good
hey re is a
trash
Was Taylor Lautner too good for this??

THIS IS THE BEST NOVIE EVER PLZ MAKE Part 2 I LOVE THIS

I can apreciate the way the movie is stylized and looks/feels like the spy kids movies and shark boy and lava girl..... But purely on a nostalgic standpoint.If it was completely unrelated to either movies i wouldnt have even given this a glance

Good to see Agent Peña and Agent Murphy Become heroes after the hunt for pablo escobar and The Cali Cartel

Me: *sitting there at age 8 excited for shark boy and lava girl&quot;Me: <b>sitting there at age 23 excited for We Can be Heroes....but wondering what happened with my life  </b>

No one in the right mind gonna want to see this period.

Priyanka Chopra is in it.....yepppeeee.....After watching trailer.......where???????

Taylor fucking dooley!!  i had the biggest crush on her when i was a kid.

Tbh I only watched it for Pedro pascal and Boyd Holbrook

Pedro Pascal, you disappoint me...
OMG The special effects are so bad, it&#39;s HILARIOUS. 

Sharkboy and lavagirl, I feel so nostalgic 
In thumbnail, PC looks like adult face of Millie Bobby Brown 

Total ass come on robert rodriguez

PLEASE THIS WAS SO ORIGINAL I HOPE THERES MORE IN THE FUTURE 
.... a copy of marvel but no offense tgey tried threr best

This reminds me of &quot;bokuno hero academia&quot;

the main girl with black is literally deku-

I started watching the full movie today 
how can i find it full movie

Its cool I watch it on nextflix its my favorite now

My mom have a netflix movies i watch we can be hero is so amazing

sharkboy and lavagirl is my childhood

When will this movie come?

I can&#39;t be the only one who watched this beacuse they used the original lava girl actress as lava girl in this movie.

Wow there is   the    adventure  of    lava girl and shark boy too

It&#39;s completely made of imagination and children like things.. but it would be fun

The trailer should have been the movie.. cause netflix is a lie. Its sucks. Its for kids. BUT IT STILL SUCKS

NOOOOO ORIGINAL WAYY BETTER

<a href="">1:43</a> whats the name of the woman with the curly hair on the right?

Do you know what this movie has in common with morgzCringeGeneric and u did not see this comin&#39;Copied

 Movie made by kids

i like is video

Your 8 year old sister and her friends after watching the Avengers:

This movie is sooooooo gay

Pedro Pascal watchin this movie in a future : Kids.... Don&#39;t get drunk when you readin the script for the movie

What a movie man ️

The funniest part of the movie is when Face Maker roasted  Priyanka.

I already watched the movie in netflix im not gonna spoil anything

I guess this is really for kids

This would have been an ok movie back in 2000 but now???seriously?

Missy: this shirt says &quot;leave me alone.&quot; Missy: <b>wears cutely uwu</b>

But in the end of the movie it&#39;s all just a practice ahhahahahahaha

Oh no, SHE&#39;S GOT SHARK STRENGTH! This movie is terrible

I thought it would have promise, but when I was released, I just saw only a movie of pure Hell.

Wwwwwwwwwwwaaaawe

To The Owner of NetflixCan you please be free for this valentine week. Just like you did in January 5th and 6th Pleaseeeeeee.........

I love that movie

Must watch for all those who never watched SciFi And u will never come back to SciFi category again

I love the na na na na

Its so funny when guppy says (to protect your buts when you hit the ground

I&#39;m here for Priyanka Chopra

Omg the movie is amazing, you should definitely watch it

Can we get a part two of the movie it may take a while but I luv the movie

The amount of adults in the comments getting upset over a movie for kids is overwhelming

Plot twist:Fast forward and  rewind Didn&#39;t control Slow mo when Slow mo is Pulling noodle&#39;s Arm Fast forward and rewind didn&#39;t control him lol Cool twist there Ay

Cheezy
hey netflix i just got my own netflix subscribtion

Or part 3

Can you make part 2

Priyanka is an Indian But she is in English movie WOW

Ay mando?

The acting tho 

Sharkboy and lavagirls kid?But to make a baby you must have se-

Also if you haven’t seen it the director hates Trump and has hidden political messages about a “stupid president” and my kid has to watch this bullshit... this movie sucks

Why is nobody talking about the fact that shark boy and lava girl are siblings that had a child together 

We Can Be Heroes - A tiktoker&#39;s film :3

lava girl x shark boy is cannon now

<a href="">1:06</a> Wilhelm scream
Hi I’m sorry I’m just going back to the house I love this house I just saw your message I’m just going back to work and I’m just going back to the house to go back and I’m just gonna be there for you all day and I have a good time to do with the kids I have no problem getting my house done

Rubbish.
there&#39;s no 5th season of CAOS but we can get a second movie about this

Don’t blink or you will.... another flop 

It&#39;s a good movie. Some might not like the ending but it&#39;s still a very good movie.

Vaaaow what a time wasting trailer..

Is that mando

.......

ojo is just silent but deadly

My hero vibes
Priyanka Chopras acting was phenomenal here 

Wow, everyone saying this is a kid movie while it has a lot of moral to learn of.

I never thought i would say this but this movie is cringer than morgz

Priyanka  screen time in this trailer

Too much cringe
I love the fact everything looks like it&#39;s in front of a low-budget green screen

My aunt came and met all the kids in this show;  she met them because she worked with kids needy kids.

There making part 2 already starting awesome

The girl with pink hair &amp; suit almost look alike lavagirl &amp; her suit pink hair

Just came here for “Shark Boy &amp; Lava Girl’s Daughter”

Worst movie ever. Even spy kids are far better than this

Sasta Avengers 

???...

Why is not other We Can Be Hereos.

the only thing i liked about this film was pedro pascal

Ewwwwww, who are the people liking it !!!

Thumbnail _ Priyanka chopraTrailer - time to be a hero. Just one dialogue 

Am I the only Arab here?

<a href="">2:14</a> that was the most epic part ever

FACT : every American got a superpower

Adventures of shark boy and lava girl I am 17 now I wanted to forgot about the nightmare I had 15 years ago

This Movie Sucks Who Agrees With Me..........

This money is so ass and so funny I grew up watching the first one perfect age but now I got the mates back together and we laughed our asses abt this great

Why does this remind me of My hero academia :_)?

This movie is the dumbest thing I saw today  pls dont waste your time

Idk and idc who the Indian women is, I&#39;m just here for what was advertised &quot;A Sharkboi and Lavagirl sequel&quot; and that&#39;s not what we got. I&#39;m outta here.

soeeee️
Dad look it&#39;s the mandalorian guy

i watch this film  like 10 times already so cool

Guys, it&#39;s a kids film. Don&#39;t expect Interstellar and logic here.

What is the music in the background

Omg prianka chopra Shes one of my fav Actresses

sharkboy and lavagirl cinematic universe

We not going to talk about how Sharkboy looks like a knock off of the masked mutant?

I swear if David Bowie’s Hero’s ain’t in this.

Isn&#39;t this THE SAME PLOT from Spy Kids???

Sooo Spy Kids 4...

Ripoff of avengers

Its like this movie was made in 2000

Pubg mobile

What the this is even cringeir than the sharkboy and Lava girl

&quot;Hey hey that&#39;s the mandalorian guy&quot; is me after seeing him

This would have gotten a better rating if it came out in 2007 or 2008

Wow Priyanka Chopra 
Why did I think this was going to be extremely violent and not kid friendly at all.

CRAAAAAAAANNNNNNNBG

This is a movie especially for KIDS so that they learn how to always stay together no matter what kind of a person you are. They are learning to be better people for future so stop with the judging!!

Wow we dumb u took names from the game super city rewind is reverse flash in that game and fast forward is flash

I knew that lava girl and shark boy had some chemistry in the old movie

I watched it

Priyanka Chopra doesn&#39;t look like Priyanka Chopra
I don't want English, brother, please comment in Hindi.
The mandalorian be doing other heroic stuff.

IT IS A COPY OF MHA how can you do this 

i can be a big bitch = priyanka.

Not good movi and priyanka chopra acting is not good ...Bakwas movi h

I watched this yesterday

Trash movie wouldn’t recommend bootleg spy kids shark boy looks like a wwe wrestler and lava girl looks like she works at the club

My kid really like this movie 

ONE OF THE WORST BOOTLEG MOVIES I&#39;VE SEEN.. terrible acting from kids and adults, bad story, bad cgi.. SOOOO CRINGE WORTHY! this is a SKY HIGH movie rip off!

Priyanka I love this film

<b>So basically it’s one of those</b> “children who don’t know they have superpowers but then some random guy groups them all together and then they have to save the world but really they are just saving like one state and everyone’s acting like the United States would actually put the safety of their country in the hands of a bunch of 8 year olds” <b>type of movies</b>

Spy kids was my favryt

This looks so bad

I used to imagine , this story in my childhood , like all the kids would get superpowers after alien substances fall in earth , but no adults. Lol

Waste of resources!

It&#39;s a cringy movie...

screenwriter&#39;s mistake?children with intellectual disabilities can also be superheroes. my muscles are so strong. lucky for me are my brains the same way, says wheels in the movie. what&#39;s the point of that?

shark boy and lava girl much

Shame on you, Priyanka is in the main role. Why are you spoiling the name of India because of Priyanka?
Priyanka Chopra s acting is highly praised

i saw this movie about 1 or 2 weeks ago this is a brilliant movie i ever watched in netflix

Look at the countless rings in her bulging neck .. old lady Priyanka. Feeling pity for jonas

Every individual is special... Blessed with superpowers 

Give me a sign there was going to be a part two

I love this show

When Priyanka is in thumbnail: OK WE WILL WATCH NO MATTER WHAT

Stop hating on slow-mo, he is just lagging.

If you have not seen the movie then don’t read my comment I’m surprised that wild card the son of techno cause how did he get the powers anyway should he be the son of miracle guy instead and wheels should be with that heavy guy and i think face maker could be brothers with there kind of similar powers

Too much hate comments that they turned off the comment section to the other trailer. 

Worst movie of all time

?????

It’s all fun and games until Homelander shows up

The worst movie of 2020
I just watched the whole movie in one trailer. Once again. Thanks Netflix.

Stop it guys this movie is amazing with a lot of suspense

Who&#39;s here for priyanka????

MAN I REALLY WISH I COULD BE IN THE HEROICS I EVEN THOUGH OF THE NAMES OF MY PARENTS IF I WHERE ACTUALLY IN THE MOVIE(ICE QUEEN AND MR.FLAME) AND MY NAME WOULD BE SNOWFLAME I REALLY HOPE I GET MY CHANCESS BUT NOW LET,S SEE IF THEY DO A PART TWO OF THE SERIES PLSSSS READ IT I LOVED IT AND IT INSPIRED ME
Don&#39;t compare Hollywood&#39;s diversity quota to india&#39;s reservation system..... Desi girl is in the movie because she&#39;s a good actress.

Such an original concept to make a flop movie

Back to childhood memories 

You get Pedro Pascal, you get Pedro Pascal, EVERYONE GETS PERDO PASCAL!!! He is literally everywhere 

Friend
Only for kids poor vfx spend some money Netflix come on

Do you also see comments in Korean (Hangul)? Should I call her the female protagonist? She's the girl who only gives orders.&quot; If an incompetent person gives orders, only the employees suffer. &quot; I was very impressed because it was a movie that taught a lesson.
I watched this movie It’s such a good movie

Yea I&#39;m watching this now....this is definitely a movie for kids...acting is..low quality. But I&#39;ll finish it anyway it some entertainment

Missed movie ha
Looks like a power ranger episode.

SASTE AVENGERS!

Only reason i’m watching this: pedro pascal

This so NEW CONCEPT.

They used some of the adventures of shark boy and lava girl

So I have confession . Seriously  don&#39;t watch  this movie. This movie not look like Trailer.

<a href="">1:06</a> They copied the Drax scene from Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2....

Is it weird that Priyanka in this film reminds me of her Libran avatar from the film &#39;What&#39;s Your Rashee&#39;?

Its cringey.

WHO SEE THIS LOL THINGS 

No please god

This is low... even for netflix

I just wanna see fast and furious “s Han@sung kang️️
Uh...doesnt the animation feel a bit...outdated

I heard priyanka priyanka chopra also in this movie 

Shark boy and Lava girl ️

Worst graphics and vfx ever

Top 2 in 63 countries 
Woke.

I love this movie

To protect your buts...When we put you down.... 

The thing that they keep the style of cgi editing from shark boy and lava girl and spy kids is totally awesome, like truely respectful from past movies.

is this what my hero academia on crack looks like

I am not watching this just because of Priyanka chopra in this film

Guys plsss make a part two of it

I want a part 2 its a god movie

I feel so helpless when I look at you.
Aliens always attack USA
Marvel Entertainment should just have royalties to any Superhero

Arrogant children for 90 minutes... all we never asked for. This movie will be awful.

This reminds me of <b>Sky High</b>  Anyone else??

Bullshit 
This is baal veer part 3

Good movie, bad movie, I&#39;m still watching it because of my inner child

This is inspired by the boys

AWESOME I&#39;LL DEFINITELY WATCH THIS     LAVA GIRL AND SHARK BOY DAUGHTER SO ADORABLLLLLLEEEEE 
Creepy VFX  ...........................................................
So Hollywood. Yawn!

-cringe
They cheated to indian viewers 

They don&#39;t respect the brown peopleThey just use it for thumbnail

Sasta version of avengers

this is like the power rangers, avengers and takeshi&#39;s castle just, umm... clusterfucked into one place

This is not the way.

Yo Netflix Pay Dave Chappelle bitch
<a href="">00:07</a> genuinely thought that was erling Haalaand

Ninja technique of banning Indian viewers ???
If you are afraid of severe pain and getting hurt, then I suggest that you avoid falling in love. Fewer things hurt more than getting your heart broken.

Our Priyanka is going to Hollywood and doing cringe movies.
Netflix: Jor ka jhatka dheeme se lageUsing PC to attract views

Priyanka, her character,  is it  the nick fury of this film ???

Why Netflix !!! the standard is just on a downward spiral

I thought sharkboy and lavagirl were just in max&#39;s dream?

DON&#39;T USE PRIYANKA AS A CLICKBAIT.

I love it

So Priyanka Chopra is doing day time kids television in Hollywood,  what a demotion 

Anybody getting a Secret Society of Second Born Royals vibe from this one ?

<a href="">2:21</a> When you need us, We&#39;ll be there Excellent Work

mumbiker nikhil merch copy

what nonsense is this
needed direction and story and costums ..... I mean everything

You know it&#39;s a good movie if it involves Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

I am confused, how the hell does LavaGirl and Shark Boy are here?

I kinda hated Spy kids

No one is noticing that they recasted Taylor Dooley the original Lava Girl to play adult lava girl. Omg! Also the adorable girl from Bird Box 

Well yeah they are done with &quot;Pablo Escobar&quot;

ok, I’ll only watch for pedros parts lol

It feels like they have mixed some parts of avengers movies and animated movies 

Song?



I hate priyanka but need to watch it

STOP USING PRIYANKA FOR VEIWS!!

Sky High Vibes...

looks good.........

U couldn&#39;t care less for the charactersI just want to see sharkboy and lavagirl&#39;s daughter

Aan ok! But, it&#39;s 2020-21, so why is it still looking like from the time of Spy Kids?

Its just like my heroes academia

No offence but what the hell is this?? I feel even the old SpyKids ws better than this of that time.P.S:Huge respect for PedroPascal,but man

Can&#39;t believe Oberyn Martell/ Mandalorian aka Pedro Pascal is in this movie

So they amalgamated Incredibles,Aqua Man,Avengers,DC comicAnd targeted child audienceThis show is nothing new

Excellent trailer,movie hindi dubbed 
Mando is in this movie lol surprised no one talked about him haha

I’m getting some Avengers vibes here....

Whore Kahiki
Boycott Priyanka
So trashy, it&#39;s not even cute duh
Why does the cgi look like its from 2003?

We can be heroes aka Avengers lite

Oh the actress who lies about everything and can turn her asthama ON and OOF at will nice

Ever wondered why all this happens only in America?

I watch this coz of priyanka chopra 

Priyankas name is there just to attract indian audience and I m sure she will be seen for just 5 mins in the movie

Wow pure Hollywood junk.....I do wish that Americans would get over themselves including priyanka Chopra

That lil girl look so much like Brielle  from The Ellen Show .

<a href="">1:37</a> this is clearly the work of an intern.

Good to see some colour

Ohh its just crap

Fucking release mindhunter season 3 please ,
PC why do doing these lame films

the benefit of being frm a country vd population of 130 crores. u r in movie for 2 min and u r on the thumbnail.i love pc and sry to see this happenong to her.

Can you please use your money wisely Netflix and for shows that deserve it

Priyanka is worst after marriage 

Narcos in alternate dimension + Love story 2050 = Avengers Lite <b>Excellent job Netflix</b>

What are you trying to do, brother?
I just watched the entire movie

Seriously

Rubbish
What a shity. Crap

Just some super hero&#39;s nepo kids came together imagine a bollywood version of itit would be hilarious

Ye priyanka chopra koble liya...Flop hai 100 percent 

cringe..cringe..cringe.. totally cringe

not y’all making an off brand version of spy kids smh carmen and juni cortez deserve way better than this

Why pedro why

Hollywood been outsourced to India.

I&#39;m hyped

<b>Desi Vought</b> if you know , you know

I like the new powers

On one side, Netflix is ​​making movies based on original concepts like Ak vs Ak and on the other side, this is Bawasir.
Indians Gather Here

Here's the heroine, there's the supporting actor
Now I think corona was made by netflix. 

I wud be seen this movie... But priyanka chopra sucks

i want to know how much nik jonas paid for priyabka chopra to in this movie

I don&#39;t understand why people are criticizing this movie, this is for children not for grown ass.

So Netflix has learned it&#39;s lesson, Hey Cuties &quot;Mignonnes&quot;, this is how Children should be presented on screen.

oberyn hammerhead ️
Believe me or not I don&#39;t like kid superheroic movies

Just showing priyanka face to get views

Better to watch cartoons

Pedro why ..!why Pedro?did does Mickey is not giving u enough money that you&#39;re doing this...

I wanted to see Priyanka more...

COOL

Let&#39;s be honest .!! I here only for Priyanka Chopra Jonas..

Only use priynka nameIt&#39;s a kids movie, garbage movie

It&#39;s Spy kids lite
On what level people can go down to get green card .start abusing your own culture and tradition

A poor man&#39;s avenger  the CGIs are so pathetic

The VFX is same old

We are getting Sasta avengers with Priyanka for Indian audiences 

yes 13 14 yr olds.your time to enjoy.
Leave everything aside. What&#39;s up with her neck? Why does it looks like a croissant 

Cheating karta hai Netflix ! They used PC in the thumbnail as a click bait . Not watching this !

This sucks Sharks Ass

Nice

What is this?? Pogo avengers....nicolodian avengers....I bet the graphics are much better in them

They expanded the lavagirl sharkboy universe  I see my childhood flashing infront of me

Stupid movie and trailer

Priyanka is talented actress

Looks like Indian movie with full action if U know what i mean

This is similar to Sky High we watched as kids on Disney Channel!

MN COPY
Netflix India.. Do Tamil Dubbing..
I know why priyanka chopra is on thumbnail

Finally india.s version power rangers  welcome to India

Breaking news - - Netflix got bankrupt

Straight into the trashcan

Cgi level bollywood 

This was super cringe, don&#39;t know who will watch this movie

Shark boy n lava girl....legends
A neck to neck competition for coolie no. 1 

It&#39;s basically spy kids with Priyanka Chopra on it

Nobody..... Netflix thinking that it d become the next marvel

They still use those cheap graphics

If you are watching trailer for Priyanka Chopra then forget it

My fav movie&#39;s sequel is coming.

Nice 
Animation looks really really degraded

I can see priyanka chopra just one time in the whole trailer and it shows that there&#39;s no big role of her in the movie 

Oh Priyanka!!! Seriously??!!
WTH...is this Hollywood...

I watched this trailer because of priyanka but I saw her for just a second nyc trick to get more views from India great work

Kids movie like cartoon
Priyanka overacted even in the small part of the role

1 second Priyanka haha

this is the epitome of &quot;we have avengers at home.&quot;

Is this a cheap version of my hero academia

This movie is made with kids, for kids and by kids.

Everyone’s is saying how this is like Avengers, and one of the girls in this movie was in Captain Marvel

this be some sad Bollywood ass cgi

Bhangi pandu sala bhangi movie
Bhangibp ndugiri

One fish has polluted the pond...
Excellent work rewind was the best 

Cheap.....very cheap
Cant say any about the story.....But the VFX are like Shark boy and Lava girl

Okay.....that&#39;s my hero academia 

Plot Twist: Priyanka is in the only two scenes shown in this preview

Came here after reading priyanka chopra&#39;s name on the trailer , but she does not have a very powerful or effective role in the film

Would love if Priyanka Chopra had more screen time.

Can&#39;t stop thinking of these guys in Narcos

Netflix using Priyanka Chai
More fun than i expected

Lots of love and respect Priyanka ... 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 Jay jawan jy kisan

Wait where is PC ??

They save world in reels and caught by Corona in the first hand 

did u use a toaster to shoot this movie? looks so cheap.....

Where’s pc 

Kids version of &quot;Sky High&quot;

This film is worst than netflix  india films.  B grade hwood film

The animations are poor and story is meh !

this is going to be lame

Priyanka Chopra is from a country which has a population of 1.3 billion

So grown ass parents couldn&#39;t save the &quot;WORLD&quot; (AMERICA). So these kids will save it.

looking similar to flying jutt 

HE RUINED MY DREAM JOURNAL!

priyanka has guest appearence looks like....sad

When the trailer seen by Marvel&#39;s grootGROOT: THIS CARTOON IS AMAZING (I AM GROOT)

Just a side actress in Hollywood. Except Quantico, PC failed in hollywood. She is just overrated. She is amazing in bollywood though. Hollywood should try Konkana Sen Sharma type actresses. (But not in this type of crap projects.)

Garebo wala Avengers 

Expectation : Taylor Swift Reality : Neha kakkar

False
Cartoon film

Mando is gonna handle it!

I gonnna watch that.... Just for that lil girl and PC

Just make proper vaccine , that&#39;s enough.

Copy of marvel and dc

netflix india ....we request u to please accept paytm ,phone pe,googlepay, for payment option in india ,as we most of indians have Rupay s card which doesn&#39;t accept it there,  we r unable to buy netflix     plz make this improvements in payment  options then definitely I assure u netflix will grow in India twice thrice of today please......

Something else for you to consider. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God&#39;s name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God&#39;s law, you&#39;re guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God&#39;s son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16  God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there&#39;s only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO&#39;s are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it&#39;s too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead, and repent of your sins.

Did someone strangle her neck multiple times. Why is she having scars??

As a person who grew up with spy kids and shark boy and lava girl I&#39;m actually very excited for this movie

I couldn&#39;t even make it through the entire trailer.

Jonas&#39; wife scuks! 
After priyanka tweet on farmer protest, producers are gonna lose a major amount of Indian Audience 

&quot; Avenger Lite &quot;
I love priyanka but this is really bad

Literally looks like an Indian sci-fi serial lmao

All children get ready for this, I&#39;m only talking to the children.

What the fuchka

Priyanka Chopra was way better in Bollywood



Compare to this even CW production looks gold.

Why tf this trailer is giving 2000&#39;s vibe.

Priyanka chopra fucking Sideroler

Meh...

I think flying jatt better than this good job Remo sir 

Uh 8 8 7

Uii

Not worth it
VFX is just sucked

Chapri avengers
What this trailer convinced me is not to watch this movie at any cost

Poor Vfx,,,,Look Like Cartoon
FUCKALL

OG Sharkboy And Lava girl viewers

 what is this...even kids won&#39;t like it

This thumbnail has been done only to show the people of India. Couldn't even see Priyanka properly
My hero academia Netflix adaptation
OHK

only one scene, and firstly name on priyaka chopra

Love you priyanka 
Looks like sky high part 2

Priyanka Chopra&#39;s Love Story 2050 had better special effects than this

That thumbnail girl was in trailer for just 3 seconds

PC&#39;s role: Official definition of JHAATBHAR

Priyanka in the thumbnail: 100%Priyanka in the trailer: 2 second 

Waiting....
Wait they did they film the shot in Hong Kong or America cuz I live in hk and I saw the famous place in Hong Kong

Such an original and new concept that is completely unheard of.

People should make movies which are real like on Rohingyas maemans Iraq Shias n Syria Sunnis n phalastine n gazas sunni muslims

Avengers lite streaming on Netflix ?

When they go Bollywood

Lame

Don't lower your standard
That shark girl is just amazing 

I love PC always, she started huge.. Can&#39;t complain.. But I want to see her more n more.. We proud u priya.. U r best n i believe u will rule ENTIRELY ️
interesting

You Need Guts To Go Out Of Your Stardom In Your Country And Start Doing Side Roles In Others.

The water animation thing the girl did was really good.....

Two Poor Things:-1. Graphics2. Priyanka Chopra&#39;s Hairstyle

Another bullshit Netflix movie

Fun fact : Priyanka Chopra is only  in this movie to attract Indian audiences 

This should be named as netflix scam 2020 to attract lndian

The graphics in this movie are very bad

Why do Priyanka reminds me of Johnny of the chocolate factory.

Dimple kapadia’s screen time in tenet is more than priyanka’s screen time in all of her hollywood films

It&#39;s always best to do Indian movie you can see your face 2hr instead of 2second on screen 

Priyanka chopra is insulting herself by doing 2 min role

Shaktimaan was better than it

Op

Did you just show us the entire movie?

I watched the trailer only because of Priyanka Chopra ️

The only thing missing in 2020 was an alien invasion  Btw, why does Priyanka look like Charlie from the chocolate factory? 

Spykids

Basically it&#39;s &quot;Sharkboy and Lavagirl 2&quot;

Two seconds of Priyanka and her name in the title, only to attract 1.3 billion people! Lol 

Congratulations American public, you have saved yourself by not choosing Trump again!! Guess, you don&#39;t need the movie anymore...

The background music of we can be hero&#39;s and the background music of the movie ludo is exactly the same .U can check it by seeing both the trailers . I was too shocked

What is this?
Pain to the eyes  

What&#39;s this &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; ?

Another movie that&#39;ll be my guilty pleasure to watch as it bring nostalgic to my mind. Sure its bad, but its good for the past child in me

After mandalorian Pedro Pascal suits for heroic roles

I made a pussy bhakk
I&#39;ll pass on this 

My hero academia live action is looking good.

But why?

Nice Movie for Next Generation ️️️
Finally Hollywood is matching South Indian (Tollywood style)

The early 2000s vibe of this is banging 

My hero academy in hollywood version...

️U PEECEE
Netflix: Movie starring Priyanka Chopra Sceen time: 3 seconds
Lol all are from Narcos

Flying jatt ki sequel
Man....so much money is lost making such films!!

This is going to be a lite watch.Good.

Graphics looks like as it rewinds in the repeated mode. 

Love it love it love it... 

Kids&#39; movie

This looks amazing havent seen pedro since GOT also priyanka in negative shade is just WOW 

Avengers in a nutshell.

This is me when i try to copy toppers assignment

Cheap-&amp;-Kiddy version of Avengers. 

Why in the world did someone like Pedro Pascal agree to be a part of this muddle?

Nice

Currently I genuinely feel their president is the threat to take over America then the Aliens

Even Tom and Jerry is 1000 times better.

Priyanka chopra toh dikh hi nhi rhi.. I thing she got a little role in this series. Issasai toh humhara bollywood Acha tha km sai km main lead toh mil jati esai. 

Wow my daughter will definitely watch this as she is a Priyanka fan...

Doesn’t give off a vibe of spy kids at all 

Priyanka always expression less
When avengers is out of hollywood budget

This film Hollywood / Bollywood 
@Netflix why you take Priyanka to pull Indian Views or Leg

What the hell is this?

Where is priyanka chopra in this??

Once again, Priyanka and less screen presence...I hope these people stop using Priyanka only to benefit from her popularity..

heroes in it sounds like the game Fire Boy and The Water Girl

Avengers+Incredible2 = Netflix on drugs

Iske saamne toh RaOne bhi achhi lagegi.Priyanka is seriously accepting shitty leftovers of hollywood.

ha.... nice one, NETFLIX...... wait.

I&#39;m just wondering how lavagirl and sharkboy had a kid, just a kiss from lava girl hurt sharkboy.

Not if ca I screwed up Netflis wow  what nonsense these are
PC Edit J
Ok how low was the budget on this  because the cgi ..not feelin it

I wanted to see more of Priyanka Chopra!

Priyanka Chopra and Pedro Pascal! Right!!

we have a secret weaponTEAMWORK 

so this is just a spinoff parody of Lavagirl and Sharkboy  &amp; Spy Kids wirh lots of references of them

This stupid priyanka chopra we don&#39;t need her

Shark boy and lavagirls was siblings

We are heroes

Spy kids ki sasti copy 

is that oberyn martell?

Netflix is making stupid of us as they said that Netflix is free but when ever I tried It was saying that there is problem Plse share if you guys  have same problem

Thank god hollywod

Seriously!! This guy directed Alita??

Sooooo kididsh
Brainiacs dammit!!!!!
OKAY, I got the script for annual function

I Have A Kind Request To Netflix.Please Don&#39;t Hurt Our Religion.Because When You Hurt Our Religion We Also Get Hurted.

Interesting trailer

Too much of graphics  not even feel like seeing a movie trailer...It&#39;s look like a freaking video game show...uf

This is the cringe version of avengers, actually any super hero movie

PC ♡♡
Bhosriwalo dub shows and movies in hindi
Very interesting PC has 2 dialogues

Worst than Bollywood one!

This isnt a childish movie either, its just like &quot;baby shark, do dooo do dodo&quot;

I clicked it cuz I saw Priyanka...and she wasn&#39;t there for a sec!

Incredibles movie
Why can&#39;t that rewind guy just keep rewinding the alien entry mid way over and over while we start destroying it.End of the movie.

Jokes aside... Tf is this fr 

Hollywood = Bollywood 

Bruh again with that “teamwork” stuff

I think that is right ek machli pure talaab ko Ganda kr deti hai..    

Bawaseeeeeeer

Only Indians will understand Netflix - let’s make something which can compete with FLYING JATTMarvel : yes every app has a lite version You can be one of mine.

Idk y but i clicked it seeing priyanka chopra

‘The Boys’, if it was taken literally literally and ‘Sky High’ if they were less angsts.

My childhood. Sharks Lavy️
Don&#39;t need to watch whole movie as trailer explains everything 

Worst than green lantern

this is so lame I love it

What in the-

The new mutants film looks good

This shooting took place in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.
&quot;What’s gonna work? Teaaamwork.&quot;

Thumbnail of Priyanka Chopra  Just for attract Indian audience 

This seems like the result when Asylum studios try to make an Avengers Movie.

Got low budget food ???
Just a copy of THE INCREDIBLES

I have to admit it SOME OF THE BOLLYWOOD TRAILERS ARE MORE BETTER THAN THIS CRAP.

I like to hear- her saying it, , would love to do it in real.

In the presence of dc and marvel these types of movies will just end up being flopped

<a href="">0:44</a> Stark tower But it is made in china 

Trailer is amazing it will be rock 

Sky high meets spy kids

Priyanka is such a talented but dont know why she sign this dumbest movie

Come on give Priyanka her level roles.. She is an incredible actor! Don&#39;t think that Indians can be attracted by just adding her name in the movie. Watch her movies like Barfi, Bajirao Mastani, Saat Khoon Maaf, Fashion, Mary Kom and the list goes on and on....to know how versatile actress she is!

My hero academia trashed version 
Indian audience in billions. Let&#39;s attract them by giving 2.00 seconds screen time to a leading Indian actor. Indians khus.firangs khush. 

That looks cool

Is there oberyn martell...,

She has started looking like mindy khaling

Childrens be like: we are heroesMEANWHILE AVENGERS: Are we joke for you?

<b>Low quality</b> 

i am excited
My hero academia
and yes even the self-made actors in bollywood are talentless  like SRK, Priyanka, Deepika and many more,

The only famous good actors are Pankaj Tripathi, Irrfan Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui , Ayushmann Khurrana and 4-5 more

Netflix India: Uses Priyanka Chopra&#39;s name despite of her screen timePeople in comment section : They are doing this to attract desi audienceLe Netflix India : jor jor se bolke logo ko scheme bata de

Javier Pena and Steve Murphy are back!!!

Terrible

Well there is lot of Priyanka Chopra in that trailer...

Who gets into the video after watching PC in the poster ?

Shaktiman of Hollywood .

Really Netflix ! CGI and graphics are so bad....

I just don&#39;t understand. Why do priyanka sign up for crappy movies like this?? Adding to that she might not have much importance in movie too. I mean look. At her work in India 

CRINGE

What is this 

Why Priyanka why????!!!!!
This is so dope

What a wasteland you have created?
Me : can we get the avengers?Mom : we already have the avengers at homeThe avengers at home :

These is the childhood of Avengers 

Cheap marketing/advertising.. Netflix you can do better next time. I dont see it can beat &quot;STRANGER THINGS&quot;.

What is this? NARCOS: Alien Invasion?

CWs &quot;Legacies&quot; in the form of a movie!

KKR must have directed this!!

nope, its not realistic!! so not a good one

When bollywood nepo stars are being boycotted in their own country.... priyanka is making us proud  all over the world and is being loved by everyone ️

What is the background song name

It is like MY HERO ACADEMIA. MHA

What a bawasir you have created.. You did not design this VFX thing  wow Priyanka put the cobra in thumbnail and looted a lot of views  Netflix do some saram
Copyright Movies Of Avengers
Not dubbed
So, attracting Indians by PC , but not giving her the screen she has to be in , .

So dear NETFLIX!!!..STOP using Priyanka as a puppet to attract Indian Audience...to get more views...Bcs we all know its a kids movie and she has the LEAST SCREEN TIME...over that u use pri in thumbnail....Like what have u thought???...Anyways this movie matches Bollywood soooo....

This is the Wayy!!!

Low-key Sky High
Mumbaikar nikhil wants to know your location  lable MN

Me: I want AvengersMom: We have Avengers at home.Avengers at home:

Priyanka chopra 

Avengers: A remix
Some kinda parody? ️
Priyanka chopra is in the film! Me: yeah, for like 2 mins!

VFX=
Looks more like a video game


Graphics is not so good

thos 19K likers have gone wild!

Waiter can I have cheaper my hero academia Waiter :

Who else get the nostalgia vibe of Disney&#39;s sky high ? 

Concept of movie seen stupid

y&#39;all sayin: avengers lite Me: spy kids lite

When you see the heroics ..Me : OMG Lord oberyn ️

Y this irirating hairstyle

ffs netflix, no priyanka chopra. she isnt like any representation for india

Disappointed !! Was here just to see Priyanka Chopra 

My gwaaaddddDid she said lava girl and shark boy

Englishmen make us different bhai
So we are left with our hero Pablo Escobar.
Alien says &#39;we will conquer the world &quot; but ends up conquering only America

One day I&#39;m gonna save the World

Dont know about evryone else bt i saw everyone Tiger shroff Varun dhawanAnanya pandey .... the list keeps going on and on 

Worst outdated trailer and concept

Avengers lite
Only here for priyanka

I am going to cancel my Netflix subscription and unsubscribe this channel...because You Collebe with Priyanka Chopra 

Avengers ultra max pro

Scam 2020 Netflix free For 2 days

How many people here do not know what Sharkboy and Lavagirl is ?

My Mommy is Lavagirl and my Daddy is Sharkboy omg I love that

I hate how they dragged my boi pedro into this .....

Leading lady of Bollywood  Priyanka Chopra becomes an extra when she moves to Hollywood

Midoriya yelling kacchanAnd bakugo yelling dekuIs MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ENTIRE MOVIE
good to see agent Javier PENA back.

Why is priyanka chopra getting so desperate to work in Hollywood.? Doing 2 min cameos in films

When you can&#39;t accept your own success so you want to do your own  failure with the heart️.

Is this really a Hollywood movie?.....

How delicious is this?
What bavasir has been given to you?
WHY? Just WHY?

Please add UPI payment option..

Is kinda weird watching this after you watching Narcos

whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 
When murphy and pena killed escobar and have nothing to do

This much money I have, that much I will get.
Bollywood + Netflix=C????

They told full story in trailer 
I hope that they do a 2nd We Can Be Heroes where the Heroes get captured again but this time after the villain captured them and revealed themselves and there plan for to turn all the Hero parents in the World into babies and then take over the world without them protecting it so it’s up to the kids again to save the world!

I could not even see the trailer and a movie 

THIS IS THE WAY

How many of you think that the staring and the name banner design and music was similar to Avengers: Infinity War

One more season of power rangers

NETFLIX - Lets attract Indian audience by putting PC in the thumbnail despite of her screentime.....

So Javier Pena and Steve Murphy left the DEA

When you dont have money for avengers.

After effects of priyanka chopra adoption on Hollywood can be seen clearly...

How to watch Are Bhosdi Walon Netflix for free?
Avengers lite 
vfx artist are from Pakistan kya??

So u are saying me that this is 2000th century VFX

Saste avengers 
maybe they should have mentioned it&#39;s a movie for little kids

I think its kinda cool

After Pablo Escobar Javier Penna and Steve Harrington on a new mission

A Collab with the Krrish 3 VFX team 

This is as smiliar as flying jatt..

Hagg diye bhai.
Funny how people are criticising CGI for being mediocre while in reality it has been done deliberately to match the art style of it&#39;s prequel Sharkboy and Lavagirl and Spy Kids

Now Hollywood giving tough competition to bollywood 

Is that real my hero academia

It just goes from bad to awful .

Where did the avengers go????

Spy kids new version
How do I unwatch this

<b>The little girl:</b> My mommy is Lava Girl. My daddy is Shark Boy... <b>*like no big deal*</b><b>PS: Nice trailer... I got legitimate goosebumps.</b>

Its going to be this generations spy kids cool when you are kids lame when you grow up

1rs movie 
X- Men : First class vibes....right?
Love sharkboy and lavagirl from India Mumbai city

This is unstoppable 

Harqaaaatttttttttttttttt
such amazing graphics

<a href="">1:37</a> poor greenscreen 
Hollywood Queen Priyanka .

Robert Rodriguez is coming again 

Reminds me of chota bheem and mighty raju but worse.

Netflix: Priyanka chopra in the film But we people don’t care. We actually hate all the bullywood actors. So this strategy won’t work here. By the way she has 5 seconds screen time in trailer. Fucking hilarious 

Excited 
Only for children below 12.

The boys is best

The boys is best

From narcotic to heroic we all grew up 

But where is Ross&#39;s Science boy??

Cringe
Wah...only Priyanka Chopra's thumbnail on global channel is different from that on Indian channel????????????????????????
Pedro Pascal’s acting is very well in The MANDALORIAN

THIS MOVIE WOULD BE OP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A great kids movie after a long time

I think i watch the whole movie

Why Pedro, why?

Last scene si awsome
This movie is just for kids under 12Expected More

I wish I could see the boom boom ???
Is this a parody lol

Home lander wants to know there&#39;s location.. before butcher does

were they kids or superkids ??

It should be on Netflix kids

I love it

Somethings are better left in the past

Cheap trick to get views by putting Priyanka&#39;s name in the title

When Netflix got high and watched The Boys

Using Priyanka Chopra to attract Indian audience.

Lame
I am sorry but this looks awful

Simps here for Priyanka ChopraLegends here for Pedro Pascal

Priyanka chopra only 2 scenes 

90s kids they made this movie for us

Its like a cheap Remake Of My Hero AcademiaI cant even look to compare them.

Film title credit goes to Mumbiker Nikhil

So, they just told the whole story of this movie in 1 trailer ,

Marvel+DC+Narcos+Stranger things+Fantastic four

Priyanka chopra should invite krish too 

A good story for kiddos.

Every child dreaming of becoming super hero after seeing this trailer

Guys it&#39;s actually time travel....Cause the movie&#39;s cgi feels like 1995....

People have to calm down! This is a children&#39;s movie, all the bigg ass buffers get the hell outta here!

It’s Simply American version of “Baal Veer”...)))



Looks worse than RaOne

I want this movie in theatre.

Ruso brother reacts  : hey common it&#39;s not fair we spend millions for getting perfect shot. You r crazy  how did you do this

Seems like a waste of talent

Childhood memories with lava girl and shark boy. Got to see their kid somewhat satisfies me

No free 5 &amp; 6

Hate bollywood actor or actress in it so see l

Bgm 
2scene prinka K is se better to Bollywood Main thi lead role karte hain aur ye kia lab ki teacher ka role lead character to chote bache hain is main uff

So is Priyanka Chopra now a just prop for Netflix movies now??!!

Netflix is smart by writing the name of Priyanka Chopra first to gain massive Indian views...

Ok, Netflix has too much money and running out of ideas ..

Not interested trailer

Priyanka&#39;s screentime in this movie is as much as chicks in my life

Why Priyanka is so desperate to do any movie in Hollywood 
Please reply to my question

PleaseDear NetflixWe can&#39;t sign in on stream fest please do somethingProblem, it is showing when i sign up &quot;we will notify u in coming week&quot; please reply me Mr. Netflix 

Please reply Netflix

How to see

It&#39;s saying notify

Netflix not coming free

Avengers Lite
Narcos plus average=
power rangers lite
Wow

No trailer plzz
This looks bad

PC should play superpower

 ehh what did you do making bakchodi?
Netflix does know how to get views by putting Priyanaka Chopra&#39;s pic in thumbnail

Super flop

Parody of the boys and spy kids.

RIP  VFX

Junior Avengers lite
Worse animation than daily soap operas.

Everyone in the comment section -THEY USED PRIYANKA IN THE THUMBNAIL TO GET VIEWS Netflix be like:<b>jor jor se bolke sabko scheme bata de</b>

So Priyanka has all of 5 secs worth of screen time... I don’t get what PC is doing... she does these roles that really have no meat and hardly any screen time

Lol its...like a cartooon movie

I chose Netflix, I said it was free, I wanted money
Cartoons like VFX
We can&#39;t join stream fest
Son of homelander and stormfront when

Marvel copy super heroes are similar to marvel

When my hero academia meets sky high!!

Because every problem starts in America first so for saving America is there top priority ️️

Netflix plays PC to gain half a billion subscribers from india.

Krrish 3 has better visual effects than this film. Hollywood is reaching its newer lower standards.Criticising aliens everytime. Can capture fully developed, intelligent, adult heroes but will lose against 10 year old kids.

Netflix using PeeCee to get views

&quot;Hey Young Man, You too can becoma a Hero&quot;ohh Sorry Wrong Place

I want to see more of priyanka chopra 

Looks kinda childish but then realizes the 15 year old me would&#39;ve loved it...

What??? Priyanka Chopra is not a superhero in this movie???

Is that brainiac

Bollywood wala feel de diye...Bhojpuri version looks great ???
Young Avengers much?
Feels like I just saw the whole movie

Chutyapanti
Kis kis ka Netflix stream feast nahi chal raha hai or dikha raha hai ki Netflix stream feast is at capacity.

Let me guess, Priyanka Chopra is the secret villian, isn&#39;t she?

Waste  movir
Side effects of PRIYANKA CHOPRA  IN HOLLYWOOD  ...

Interesting 
Why&#39;s Netflix 5th and 6th free subscription not working?

This is what Netflix does with my money???????????

Bakwas

I only clicked for priyanka

Americans: <b>we&#39;ll save the world!</b>Also Americans: <b>Someone pls save us from Covid-19 </b>
