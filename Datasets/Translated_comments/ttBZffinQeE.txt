She has been an arrogant woman throughout her life …

Amitabh ashes nit god ya saint 😅😅😅❤❤❤
This doesn&#39;t say much for the character of Rekha. As for Amitabh, never did quite like him.

Go to hell

YES  YES YES  YES     MUST DO ASAP

Poor Bachchan!))) They don’t let him forget his love affairs!
This shorty unpleasant looking woman is not good for Amithapachan. Let him get rid of this angry and Ugly looking faced shorty.

Jaya would never divorce Amitabh!And face into oblivion and  end up a nonentity like the others of her time.

Jaya never wanted to divorce Amitabh Bacchan

Amitab Bacchan is a Slime.

Your narration is not well prepared. It&#39;s sub quality and lacks grammar, copied and freely stolen from somebody&#39;s pocket.

There were no takers to this grumpy ugly looking coquet.

Where you got this news that Jayagee wanted to divorce her husband?you failed to show the prove.More over we know that she spoke everywhere&quot;she will never leave her husband&quot;.

Jaya shd hv divorced him before getting her first child

What the hell you are reporting, Pls respect other families.. They are made for each other, Don&#39;t spread such rummers..

Who cares about their personal life.They are entertainers, that&#39;s all.

All about Relationship with Rekha

If Jaya leaves Amitabh then it will be an enjoyable moments for amitabh

Sucessful woman has a choice. To leave her career and be housewife or to leave marriage and continue her career. Jaya chose the first and Rekha chose the second.See who is happier and looks younger. Either you sacrifice your life for husband and kids, men dont appreciate, they cheat anyways.

She is so sick n looks so old....amit is also old..but hes soooo smart. Unlike his wife..shes such a old hag...it suits her ugly face...wats so good on her  day d media is so hungry fr dem.To hell wd dis rude woman...she sickens me wd her useless talks she must go bk to sch fr learning sum respect n manners..such an I&#39;ll manners hag..DISGUSTING

This terrible divorce started with all the drama and even if it was a matter of great happiness, he hated the family so much that he started beating everyone.
Jaya is a bitch. She is sooo arrogant. Unbelievable

It&#39;s a very good news...But Amitav has no courage to accept Rekha...

They are not such fallen individuals to part ways during the last period.

He is such a selfish man...he cheated both of them....and don&#39;t know how many others also...Where were his public image while doing black, chinikum ,nishabda and others films....😏😏😏

Bachchan couple are hypocrites

Bachchan is a very  great actor and great hero  always

Just chilled Jaya go thresome its fun to share toys with neighbour...

Jia is very  decent lady  she ďeserve  respects  her efforts regarding home situation  realized she is right she is gourgios lady in bollywood  Salam jia efforts

Is omr mei divorce
Everyone is crazy
Don't show me useless things.
Take care of your english :- male is him an female is her

What nonsense news is not available, what is the false news, what is there to find?
He talks like a saint who could do no wrong

Jayaji  to  good  for  him  what  a  dec

Good decision amit made love u man
It a oldvideo

I don&#39;t like now her behaviour. But it&#39;s because she has him by her side. A bad man make a wonderful woman bad too.

Rubbish ! Thhu..
Yar Amitab thori sabr kr lata to Rakha milti na

As I have written before, this a.b. guy is a selfish piece of s--t whose pathetic behaviour has ruined the lives of his innocent wife Jaya and her two children!!!  I am glad to learn that she DID stand up to him and demand a divorce but am so sorry that she didn&#39;t follow through with it!!  She would have been much better off throwing this piece of rubbish out on the street! She could have resumed her acting career and raised her children on her own. Over here in North America we have the exact example of our adorable Debbie Reynolds whose pig husband eddie fisher cheated on her with elizabeth taylor. Debbie&#39;s son and daughter were also just 2 and 3 years old when their parents divorced and Debbie went on to great professional success, meanwhile her rotten ex-husband failed at everything--career and four subsequent other marriages and died of cancer long before our Debbie died in 2017 at the age of 85!  This Jaya is only 71 now--she should divorce this a.b. and get on with her life--she could have another 30 years to enjoy--who knows. Wishing Jaya Badhuri (her maiden name) all the best! 🤞🤗

Jaya ji became aggressive old woman I think this because she suffered alone during her long life with him , but I don&#39;t think they would divorce because of their image, they children won&#39;t let this happen

Kashmiri songs.
JAYA IS A BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING LADY  .LOVELY FAMILY

its too much to interfere in to some ones life

Guys don&#39;t you think that why jaya bachchan didn&#39;t makeup...cause jaya bachchan  knows that rekha mam looking more beautiful and younger than her. with out makeup...🤣🤣🤣

Fake news

Why the HELL bring it up now after they have grandchildren...All have problems in life...GET LOST

Rekha is super actress and professional actress can&#39;t compare with jaya

Jaya is not suitable  wife for Amitabh. She&#39;s horrible not only in beauty but  in her character she is hopeless .

Rekha really very talented lady....

fake

Amitabh Bachhan is the ass I have ever seen! He doesn’t deserve those kids

I would have loved to see him with Rekha. 😍

Stupid dilouge.this is way of india.

Amitabh  harami  he  rekha  ko  chod  kar  chordia

Who cares

amitB and his charades of respecting women is all a sham .... he could not respect that wonderful woman that jaya is! .... he is a debauch &amp; a moral criminal!

bakwas video

Vere emi leka fill chesukuntunnaru. Pani pata leka

In this summer, who will take away the heat of others?
Why  ? Why didn&#39;t you give divorce to Amitabh 👎 ?

C

Amitabh should divorce his wife I feel Jaya doesn&#39;t deserve him he should go ahead

Shaith ap ke pas popat hay...

You sharing about someone&#39;s family as if you are so close to them.... stop spreading nonsense of someone. If you want to become success like them then try to learn from someone rather then making dirty noise.  THE DIRTY SECRET IS YOUR DIRTY MIND AND PUTTING YOUR DIRTY NOSE TO SOMEONE&#39;S LIFE!!!! GET WELL SOON YOU DIRTY PUSSY CAT!!!!

You always like to send false informations

i am fed up of you repeatng leave them alonr

This was long back. why  poking nose know no work

Chichora like amitabh  can do like such thing

He will not divorce her bcoz amit he die for money and if he divorce so he must pay carrors and now i heard amit following Renu the singer bcoz she got alot of money and amit trying to marry her bcoz of renu mandal money.

I hate Amitabh
