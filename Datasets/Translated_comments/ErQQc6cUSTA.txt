&quot;Are you going to buy a PC or a console?&quot;&quot;Both.&quot;

brings back great memories, tech nerd me 4 years ago is crazy

its been 4 years dang, i still remember this being my dream pc, they gotta do something like this again

Hm will you sir sell it ?

When i becom a millionaireI&#39;m gonna buy shit like this

240fps like geforce now rtx 4080! Xd

The specs of the pc are funny to me, so weak.

Do you still have this Big O?If so would you be interested in selling it?  I’m a collector of older  and unique tech  products

This is the only entanglement I&#39;m interested in having in my life

Now build one with Xbox pro PlayStation 5 wii switch game cube with PC option also VR mode and let me have it lol

Ok class what comes before 47?Quiet kid: ak

Trying to build one myself

Did you have to personally order pc with all 3 systems in one pc, or do they only build 3 game system (which version is PS4, Xbox360, PC or 4 game system (Big O v.3)? When you go to the site, they only advertising: parts, specs, towers….etc how’d you get them to build you the Big O with gaming systems together?

is this another one off?

Can&#39;t even get it
WOW

how much would this cost

Can I change the PC parts &#39;and the models of switch ,Xbox and ps

How does it compair (pricewise) to  buying etch console individually?

who&#39;s here after watching the vid of the v3

That thing probaly generates a shit ton of heat... at least you&#39;ll be good for the winter.

I would sell my soul for this. Of course with PS5 and Xbox one on the board

How much

I saved my money

momma mia!....thats a spicy meatball!

that storage is enough for about 4 more cod updates

this is retarded. none of those systems need to be water cooled. you cant overclock them. they are all quiet already. this makes no fucking sense. i love how he tries to do mental gymnastics in order to try and make sense of this cluster fuck of a contraption.

Imagine knocking the table over 
WEL YEA IT TIS AMAZING BUT IT IS A COMSTUM BILD  ..PROBABALI LAK 40 K .. AND ONLEI FOR   EXPO ...  ASN FRO THA STRIMIG . NO MORE COMENT !

What is the difference in this am me just sick taping all of my stuff to my PC?

Please tell me it&#39;s still available

ALL TITLES ARE GAME DEVELOPMENT IN GENRE

ITALIAN MARITAL
LAVENDER EYES

Shoulda called it all for one

someone did a breakdown of all of its components, and estimated it at around $28,000 - $34,000. this includes parts, and the manual labor to assemble it

Me on a Separate ps5Separate ps4Separate one xSeparate 3080 pc Also me: ha ha

The Nintendo Switch should have been watercooled. This is a cop out.

I&#39;m back here to ask you to do with Series X, PS5, Switch and a PC, or just wait a little while for a maybe the pre-release of Switch Pro, PS5 &quot;PRO&quot; and Series X Pro.

you are not worthy no of my genius lame

Well, now I just have to sell my house...

As much as I have to admit this is an awesome idea, as a member of the PC master race I can&#39;t help but feel this is an absolute abomination lmao

waiting for someone to think of combining pc and ps4 in 1

Something for Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo players

How much

If it doesnt play the discs and cartridges, its not really worth it

The ultimate question is. But can it run minecraft?

Outdated no 3090 or ps5

Wait you missed the opportunity when you said we ready for on the go we got the Yoshi.....you didn&#39;t say Yoshi on the Goshi for that you lose

&quot;If you a have a big enough case&quot;Feels like &quot;Everything is a dog if you try hard enough&quot;

Big O? <b>SHOOOOOOTIMMMMMME</b>   <b>!!!</b>
Me want badly but now PS5, switch, PS3 why COD BLACK OPS 2 MULTI-PLAYER AND ZOMBIES UNLESS IT GETS REMASTERED. not a Xbox fan.
That is absolutely insane

We all noticed that the heat from one CPU is just being transferred to the next, right?...

I could never own this because I would get robbed where I live.

6th gen console gamers would&#39;ve dreamed of a ps2, gamecube, xbox, and 2000&#39;s potato pc in one back in 2005.

I want these so bad

UT still plays OW?! LETS GOOOOOOOOO
I bet whoever got this is mad that new gen is out 

@10;:04 what kind of doggo is that???

They should make another one and call it &quot;The big O 2.O&quot; With the Ps5 Xbox Series X and the Switch Oled. 

When will the update be released?
I hope they do it for the very good PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch and the Xbox series X

The PC 2

now that I look at it, they just needed a ps4 in there. game pass does the same thing a xbox does

Where do I get this tho

@Unbox Therapy no switch gameplay, so i dont believe there is a switch over there.

You call that a knife? This is a knife 

Hello can purchasing one of those units be used to start an Arcade business?

imagine all this with the size of the steam deck fuck thatwould be the ultimate console

But why Xbox? PC + PS4 plays pretty much all games only peasants who can&#39;t afford a good PC use Xbox

Pssh &quot;Ultrawide&quot; I&#39;ll show you an Ultrawide <b>Shows Samsung Oddessy G9</b>

,,Time to unleash the beast.&quot;- every Big O owner when they&#39;re about to fire up the whole system

What about the gaming consoles that we did not know

cant find the big o

Imagine a mid 2000s version of this that&#39;s an original Xbox, PS2, and Nintendo Gamecube, all connected to a Core2Duo PC with windows Vista, 512MB graphics card, 2 gigabytes of DDR2 ram, and a 250GB mechanical hard drive.

If you&#39;re rich af, no problem you got the kind of money for this. If you&#39;re not, which kidney do you want to sell?

can you make upgrades to the pc?

That&#39;s a awesome idea wish they could do more customized for like find a PS3 playback model an other vintage style consoles an build them into a case where there safe an sound for the future

Your guys are geniuses !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just saved all my money to buy this fuckkk the ps5 is out this is old

What about the power usage

Loved that Opus Eponymous shirt aswell.

This is just incredible

I remember eating I think pancakes while eating this

according to my knowledge, that ps4 pro will break soon. (after being used for a while)

Sad, the origin doesn&#39;t sell this version

All boys want this but no boys need this

Bro where can I get this beast of a pc/console

Now do the new consoles

I want one how do I get one?

How much did this cost?

WOW!!!!

This one is for millionaires

in the thumbnail it looks like its about to fall on him

Can I buy this ?O mamá yes you can

&quot;*yes*&quot;

It doesn&#39;t include the KFConsole, I&#39;m not into it.

lol

Group of friends: So u tryna do lan coop? Kinda sucks cus itl be split screen but oh well.Kid who owns the big o: about that......

That’s not every console jackass

When you can&#39;t decide what console you want:

PRICE PLEASE

Is this legal?

<a href="">1:35</a> he turns into a Black teenager

Can&#39;t wait for big O 2 with ps5, XBOX Series X and switch OLED model.

I'm watching this and crying inside thinking about how many kidneys I'll have to sell to have 1 of these sjsjsjsjs
Wife replacement

What is it with the music, It’s frickin weird

hey i want buy this Device tell me how and I searched this site, but I couldn&#39;t find it

when next gen ? ps5 , xbox series x and more

yes mom i need this for online classes

I&#39;m still savin for my first PS5 

This just looks like waste of energy to be honest...

You're already there?
… I can only imagine what the 2.0 version’s price would be with ps5 and Xbox series x motherboards.

what kind of witchcraft is this man kid: what console do you play on you :&quot;everything&quot;

The xbox is pretty useless there since you could use a pc to play the same things but the ps4 or ps5 is understandable because of the games limited to it

Friend : what console you play onRich kid : yes

Why not wiiu

This is incredibly stupid..... Why would you combine all 3 systems to be powered at the same time? If my ps4 dies, I want to my my Xbox and visa versa. This has no redundancy and his power bill probably jumped $10 just for an hour of playtime.

I have more powerful pc a different ps4 pro and a xbox as well hehehehhe .. rtx 3090

<a href="">3:18</a>

Or....you could have a massive desk...4 consoles and monitors all lined up next to each other....boom ...SAME THING....! PROBABLY LESS WIRES TOO

2.5 k yeaaaahh

For those doingbmemes thinking u can get it ia just a demo of what they can do in pcs not for buy and those who just make memes knowing that are ok

amazing the evey compnent get old in 2 years. pc xbox ps in build all become low end. only switch part useful this machine now wtf.

Video

Awesome

how much does this thing cost

oops, i dropped it
This is insane

$2500 to start

Shi with how much storage a lot of the games take especially the ones towards the end of the Xbox and PS4 lifetime a part of me doesn&#39;t think 14 tb is enough 

<b><i>They should build a ps5 and a series x and switch in one pc case</i></b>

will it ever come back in stock is my question

I have to sell my kidney to get this

Me watching this and want it so badMe thinking want organ should i sell

Give me one

I want this, we All want this

so happy w mine definitely would recommend to anyone considering it

Sucks that just a few months later it&#39;s already out of date

Jesus Christ is the King don’t use The Lord’s name in vain.

Dam the XBOX and PS4 PCB&#39;s so ugly looking!! In 2021 I wonder how much this &#39;system&#39; would be worth (consider the pandemic and silicon shortage right now).

I call it the one box 360 one x

The big o.. the price. Big dough.

I would by this if it was a combination of PS3, PS4 and PS5

where is the pleasure of simply playing
Try this for new gen consoles

this is what we call fake news

Wow

<a href="">4:50</a> sings: i need a dollar.
bad!

great video. do you think they will do a BOG O 2.0 to PS5 AND XBOX SERIES X

I think only I have useless ideas but I don&#39;t know origin also have useless ideas

The noise after he put the nintendo switch in made me jump lmao!

I&#39;d say it&#39;s a great idea but it would cost too much money for the ones that can&#39;t afford it so I guess we all have to stay with it being split like it is I have Xbox PlayStation Nintendo I have a lot of them did have weed but I sold it it had PlayStation one gave it to my grandson did have

3k graphics card yup that&#39;s my entire budget

what is the price of this I kinda want it

Yes mom, it’s for school.

i wish for one of this 

can you put the moniter website

How much ?

He forgot Nintendo switch
Hi

How to go bankrupt in seconds....

Can you plis send me this gaining stetup so I can review ir

I&#39;d be like a kid on Christmas

How much for this

I want one

so is no one gonna talk about the knife he was using?

@a2d

Are they making a next gen one?

who the fuck needs 14 fucking TB of storage

What about PC can I use it like a normal PC or is only just for games ?

they should update the model

They have to do the same with ps5 and series x

You know its tuff shit when you have to unscrew the box

Bro they need to upgrade lol and wait as well for the new switch

Now they just gotta remake it with the xbox series x, ps5, and 3090

wouldn&#39;t it suck if all his friends were mobile gamers

Say no more.I need that.

i Think You Should Name it &quot;PlayBox&quot; That will be cool 

Who needs kidneys or a heart when you’ve got this.

Not on the ps5

the big O upgrade coming soon?

I wish I have this one day

What a waste of money

All i need is ps5, series x and pc2 in 1 box.

“What console or pc do you want?”“Yes”

My dream setup

This, this is true power.

Ima go buy this

The xbox is useless it would be better to have Pc, Ps4 and Nintendo

Nobody talks about how cool the knife that he used to open the box is

Just bought 2 of these for my twin brother&#39;s, They&#39;re reaction was priceless

“Every console in one box” literally only PlayStation and Xbox because your one of those guys no one likes

Very good  !!

I want one 

You can only imagine what there going to do with the new consoles systems

Price: Inf

I have ps,xbox and Nintendo thanks but I don&#39;t have my kidney no thanks 
Wait. That&#39;s illegal

But what if there an tutorial of how to build it without putting this computer on sale I said not on sale

i need this, gimmie have it

What&#39;s the point of having an Xbox when you also have a gaming PC?

&quot;Soda eksbox sgotta preinstalt eaternet. Got da eksbox rettitahgoh. It&#39;s ah customthing...&quot; 
Them: what do you play on?Me: yes

The price of the wood used to encase this system would probably cost more than the system now a days. If you know you know.

The big oh my god on the price

its a complete gaming pleasure  
<a href="">1:05</a> I like how the guy is just on the pc and he’s like... LET ME FRICKIN RELAX

what if they upgraded it to have the series x and the ps5?

When PlayStation and Xbox had a baby

&quot;Now witness the power of this fully armed and operational battle station!&quot;

Is their a way they can use your PS4, Xbox and switch to built the BIG O? I&#39;m just wondering because I have kids and we have 2 of each.. I don&#39;t need 3 ps4&#39;s, xbox&#39;s and switches.. may be a dumb question but I had to ask... ty

How can im buy, its too expensive?

i have to pay this in AED.... KIDNEY OUT OFME NOW

Vvvv
I would literally sell my organs for this

More shit we can&#39;t afford

It&#39;s $2500

My girlfriend hates it 

Really thought he said 2 bucks I would have cried.

that costs as much as 4 kidneys

STEEL BATALION line of contact.. it is an original x box game that was played with its very own GIANT CONTROLLER... is it possible to completely convert this game into VR.. so you can bypass the giant controller and play it entirely in VR... on your PC

This made my ps5 laugh. Thank you for that.

That device would drive me nuts for all the mods I&#39;d have to go through and find again gahhhhhh

Love what origin does not only the Big O Defenetly gonna buy from them

Holy shiiiiiit

Can u buy these or no

Payment method: V2Visa MasterCardKidneyUr soul

great stuff
For the price and what it’s worth not worth it especially because everything is becoming cross play so pc and ps4 and Xbox and play with each other so I say if you have the money just get the pc but I can’t afford that so I just got the ps5

Ym=1 terr baap ka you tube he?

Enjoyed the overwatch gameplay

I would hate buying one of these then having it all be outdated when the new stuff comes out

I jus want a ps5n u hv all dis

Just imagine building up a complete fortnite squad with this single box, playing 4 platforms at the same time. That would be so epic. Next gen LAN party is here, my friends.

well this is rare

Wow this is beyond unbelievable it’s like every gamers dream come true. This is Gamethology

Damnmnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

Origin you heros

So we have found the future essentially

And people said pre-builds were bad

that is pro

The entire time i was just tryna find out where he got that knife

at <a href="">5:50</a>, has anyone mentioned that is Agents Of Mayhem? or is it?

If only they knew one year later the next gen of consoles would come out

Where isn the kfconsole

just buy them sepretly cause tech changes in some year how would change and would cost much cheaper cause u can trade in your ps4 now that ps 5 has come out i find  this tech intresting but tech changes everynow and then so its better to buy it seprately

Need a Big O 2.0 now. Ps5. Series X. Switch. And high end pc.

Everybody gangsta till water color spilled
How the h3ll? Isn&#39;t there something like copyright issues?

I see what is called Big O, so it run the code at compelxity of O(n!) where n = array of games input, right?

I can&#39;t even imagine getting one of these

This man just ended console wars

What socket type can I use for a mod on xbox 360? A I want to use a massive heatsink of pc can I use 775? Xbox 360 e

In 2040 You : kid this was 1 of the best technology Kid  :what tha this is trash i can do best with 500$

Instead of this buy origin genesis

This is what ending console wars looked like

16billion dollars
I hope they do a v2 with the series x and ps5 and a badass gaming system with a 30 series that would be cool just to see in a video. But like I would definitely want to own one.

Price?

SpongeBob.IIIIII NEEEEEEEEEED IIIIIIIIITTTTT

lol imagine buying this then 2020 comes around with next gen

Incredible... but!!! Does not play ps2 ps3..

Well this thing cost 2 Kidneys

mobile players be like : am I a joke to you

Who got recommended?

Lucky are those who could afford it

Wow it’s outdated nkw

I tried to buy this being it would be my first gaming pc, but I had NO idea what I was building, I just want the exact same one you have. Help?

and for short : B O

Where’s my Xbox 360, ps3, Xbox Original, PS2, PSX, PS1, Wii, Wii U, GameCube, Dreamcast, Saturn, SNES, NES, N64, Atari?Oh and don’t forget that Mistake of an android TV game console. So bad it wiped the name from my memory.

me: i buys this because it looks good as a coffe table

I wonder how much this beast cost...

I challenge them to make the big O with the  Ps5/xbox series x instead of 4 and one

I wonder, would they do this with next-gen consoles

How?

All consoles in one<b>SHOWS PLAYING ONLY PC</b>

We need an update with ps5 and xbox x

Coming soon to raspberry pi near you

yes mom i need this for studying

But can it run crysis?

how do i find the prize for this thing?

and now its outdated

Now we need a next gen edition 

Waiting for the Series X, PS5 and 3090+5950x

i think my brain landed in russia

I&#39;d give up my first born child for that thing

Can you get one with the next Gen consoles

Y is he talking so much different than usual?? Sounds like he is tryin to change his voice fuckin weirdo

talks about black bars, still has black bars.

You made me freak out I want a set so can you tell me the price? If they send it to you so that you can mount it? I want to put a ps5

Can it play Fortnite?

A weapon to stop the console wars

I feel like this thing would cause a lot of stress...

3k ? very lesss

Thats pretty cheap

is that thing even safe to plug in?? gonna fuck around and overload allll the circuits. This thing needs its own generator lol

Can we get an updated version of this with next gen consoles? After the supply issues sort themselves out that is.

How much is this? I want one.

2 to go please...thx ;) but i wonder where to put the gamings discs...?

We need the Big O 2 with the ps5 and new Xbox and an rtx 3090

so when you&#39;re playing on one platform... does the other 3 just run idle?

Now imagine xbox series x and ps5 and pc and switch in 1 case

What would you pick? Big O or Just separate Devices

There is a problem. Now you have to buy upgrade.

They should call it the “Ninxtendostation 4”

Big O! Show time!

Its a shame it won&#39;t be consol to buy thou Juts like shere know kinda type if it where on everywhere on the market it would be massive hit

This didnt age well...

To give this pc to this moron its prob one of the biggest insults i&#39;ve ever seen in gaming, such a shame

Instead of paying 17,000 dollars just buy the new consoles and a pc which rounds up to around  3,300 dollars 500-ps5 500-xbox series x 300-nintendo switch and 2,000-gaming pc and if you want all the gear then that&#39;s about another thousand dollars so instead of paying 17,000 pay 3,300 or if you want the gear the 4,300 and it&#39;s even more next generation for cheaper also If you want it in all one box If you know how to do this I guess you could put it in like a large metal box and put switches on there to change the console you use witch could be 300 dollars so 4,600. But anyways no one could even afford that so... I put way to much thinking into this.

&quot;How much fire hazard do you want?&quot;Lewis: &quot;Yes.&quot;

You know, I&#39;ll just stick with my GameCube

3k graphics card 

Imagine this with a series x and ps5.

Watch them make a Big O 2 with the PS5 and Series X Motherboards and a Switch Pro/2/Dane/T239 (Whatever the name ends up being, same hardware) in there.

so unsocial. lol

does somebody need an extra kidney i want to sell it

What would like to pay throughYour family soulYour kidneyVisaMastercard

xbox serie x y ps5 :3
You better remake this

this would be great just to have four TVs in your room and play the same game with a LAN network through four different platforms

Soo 2021 version coming out too?

Does it have PS4 and Xbox built in ?

Next up: this againts my gtx 1060 thats 160$ ha ha ~ thelifetimecoach

I thought the console is built in not you need to have every console

How come on the site you cant choose all the consoles?

Do I really need 2 kidneys anyways

How much u want for it

This literally ends the console wars.

In a year now, they should make one with the Xbox series X, the PS5, and the Switch pro (hopefully we’ll get a switch pro)

So which console do you have The rich kid - ...

Everybody: <b>price memes</b>Me: What if the water cooling spilled?

How bout nintendo or how about the n64

Looks like you need 8 different warranty programs

It&#39;s definitely targeting the rich category not because of the price, because you better have your own turbine power supply or your electrical bill will go through the roof.

I wonder how many units they have sold so far.

<b>The forbidden console</b>

I’d rather have my PS5

Here&#39;s a suggestion, take the PS3 slim and put PS5 equivalent tech inside it, to make it smaller

This or Ps5 or Xbox x

What a Good time to put in my recommendation YouTube 

In a era of ps5 and X box series X this will be PC 2

the world: I NEED IT

When your dad says you can only have one gaming console.

So this thing just doesn&#39;t exist for the average consumer with both ps4 and xbox one -_-

I never thought such beauty of technology could be conceivably build by human hands; yet this is amazing I want one hands down

Should throw a nvidia shield in there with all the emulators too. On a serious note. How much is this thing?

Hope they make a new one now with the advancements coming up in gaming

I want to sell my soul for this masterpiece

This machine should be remade with PS5, New Xbox and a system with RTX 3090.

¿why not raffle this machine in the community of followers?, yo se que no pague this computer or i dont have your sponsors, and I know that was much work for obtain this beast for your channel.But i think how with the arrival of the PS5, Xbox series X, the rtx 3080,3090.What are you going to do with this pc? is a stupid question for this great war machine. But with the tecnology advance and your job is with all components more new, so in the future your they will have another computer better than this. Please, in the moment that don&#39;t need this computer anymore It would be good to raffle it out for us, thanks and a like for let the message get to them. greetings gamers

i realllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy wwwwwwaaaaaaanttttttttttttttttttt thatttttttttttttttttttt
website shows only getting a choice between ps4 pro or xbox one s. No switch mentioned anywhere. No xbox one x. No option for all 3 consoles. Even just customizing with ps4 pro only and moderate PC hardware, still comes to over $3000. Maxing out PC hardware options brings total price over $5000 with no periferals, no xbox, and no switch. not worth and unimpressed.

I wonder if they will do this with the new consoles.

Ghc

<a href="">9:18</a> That A Lot Of Wires I’ll Just Buy Both Consoles Separately Rather Than Buying This It’s Cheaper

so how would you insert a cd in this pc like if you did not think about it/&lt;._.&gt;\

This is something which can be useful in a gaming parlour

How much does it Cost

My favourite console is XBOX! XBOX FOR LIFE AND PS4 SUCKSSS

Why did they put an X-box in it?  Xbox games already run on a pc.

I no longer need my 9-5 with the help of, <b>p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e . c o m</b>

I like how when you turn on the pc hdmi you get a competitive game and when you turn on Nintendo Switch you get mario then when you put the ps4 hdmi you get spiderman then shen you put the xbox hdmi you only get the menu screen because xbox is not rich woth exclusives lmao

My Friend : Likes the Big O and wants to get one.Later That Day : My friend has a Big O which he got in return for his kidney!

does anyone want to gift a gift card to me?

Why do you need that machine??To play spiderman

But can u use all 4 at once?

Tell Kirk we have the same name lol

How come I didnt see this on Linus&#39; tech tips? Right, he wouldnt approve nor praise it so easily and origin then wouldnt be able to proudly state &quot;This was created in response to our 2019 Big O that we sent to Unbox Therapy&quot; not to mention how ugly the actual case look compared to one in the video, no nintendo switch and you choose either ps4pro or x1s edition. Shaking my head. This is BULLSHIT! I&#39;d still wouldnt buy one. Matter of fact, I never buy oem pc, no one should, ever!

pc users must be cowering in fear after seeing the price tag of this thing

Who in their right mind needs THREE CONSOLES AND A PC.

My kidneys are worried

FERB! I know what we&#39;re gonna do today!

Electric bill: wassup ??  Did you miss meyy?

<b>XBOX scarlet comes out</b> <b>ps5 comes out</b> <b>becomes erelevent</b>

It hurts me that he will never use this again and it will be wasted

If you think about it, this is really unconvient

He should have an intro it should be:Wanna know how poor you are?Asking why is these expensive items has big box cuz this is where you sleep after you sell your house for a pc.

Say goodbye to the console wars

sorry but I dont play fortnite anymore

wonder if origin will plan on doing a revision with the next gen consoles.

Biggest unboxing sir.
This is THE FUTURE

Good Morning. What is the price of this product now a day?

THE BIG O   IF YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING
When the PS5 and the Xbox Series X get released  they should remake it with those two consoles and with the Nintendo Switch

SANAOL

It would be cheaper if you bought everything seperatly

Disappointed that I can&#39;t get this.  :(

I can&#39;t find an option for both PS4 and Xbox. It just let&#39;s me choose only 1 :&#39;(

I&#39;ll wait for PS5.

Who hates ads

2*1 Tb SSD+14TB hard disk. who needs a data centre stuff on a pc

I don’t need one. I already have a PC and PlayStation. Okay perhaps the Nintendo Switch but no to xBox

I cant afford it RN

A cheaper way around this is to get a PC buy xbox and playstation and literally just put it all in one connection so you can switch inputs via monitor saving 4k

Now they gotta make a new one with the PS5 and Xbox Series X 

That thing costs $5,827.52 in Australian Dollar.

Love how he’a acting like this is a console but it’s just a really good pc with xbox and ps4 logos on it lol

you are great

Throw a little mac in there as well for jokes

But can it run crysis?

What does it cost ?

Finally the XTENDO BOXSTATION

Will they be doing this for the next gen consoles?

It is the perfect machine for gamers
If it can run be used for photography and videography then the price is normal. But can it play ps1, 2, 3 and Nintendo games?

imagine buy this and you only play tetris

Maybe if I sell my liver ik can buy it

000000000h my DAMN

Where to buy?

Can I buy this? And for how much?

I would rather buy a high end pc, a PS4, an Xbox One S, and a Nintendo switch. It’s probably cheaper.

2020Xbox series x With ps5

Got to get this thing...my gosh

Meanwhile In 2030, oh it only costs 100 bucks

Lol whos here after Xbox series x and Ps5 reveal.

What&#39;s the difference between Xbox and PC? Except the higher graphics output in PC?

if they make one with ps5/xbox x im selling my kidney and buying one :)

Only sad thing is if you buy this the new xbox and ps5 coming out this fall so oof so this will be worth next to nothing except for the switch and gaming pc inside when the xbox 1 came out the 360s were literally being given away and the ps3 was worth dirt too so...

let me get the ps5 PC XboxX version

They chose a bad time to release this with the PS5 and Xbox series X around the corner.

Imagine if it was series x and ps5

Who needs a xbox ps4 and a nintendo ifo you already have a high end pc

yes thats sick as xxxx

BIG OOOOOO!!!SHHOOOOWTIME!!!

How much is this worth

Every mans dream console

Ohhhhhh I want I want i need owww I can’t buy

Never seen such a useless thing, i&#39;ll only play one thing at a time, but rather all three systems will boot up for no reason, consuming excessive power

amazing
Imagine having every console ever in it and not just the modern consles

Waste of money

We need a bigger knife

Friend: &quot;so what console do you play on&quot;The Rich Kid: &quot;yes&quot;

Do he actually keep the items for use ? Or is it only collected an put in storage?

&#39;tis been reported this thing can run Jesus fucking christ

Can’t wait for the ps5 and xsx edition and have to pay with my lungs!

The war of the consoles has ended

Do you need Xbox live?
I showed this to everyone who plays on a game consoleNow they live in peace and harmony

Got my kidneys listed on the black market for this. Need it.

I&#39;m buying the Xbox x series&#39;s and ps5 like this

<a href="">5:59</a> not even paying attention to him I&#39;m to focused on the doggo :D

Can i play gta V on this???

Cool custom pc

<a href="">5:14</a> how is he playing Spiderman with Keyboard and mouse? Damn

What if it was a ps5 and xbox series x in it

Can you gameing pc
and he plays overwatch

Me thinking: how expensive will the version with xbox series x and ps5 be

is this some kinda rick joke, that i am too poor to understand

I can just imagine the electric bill that month.

Hey kids can we finally stop on the meme comments - Me: Yes / Mom: can we get a ... comments are so painfully annoying. Use your brains and actually type a real sentence.And for all the comments about how could never afford it.... its about double what decent modern mid range custom built gaming computer would cost... A lot less than I thought it would cost. Just wait 5 years it will less than a grand :)

so excessive
The new Big O only has an option for one console and one pc... (PS4 Pro OR XB1 S, not both) and the most top of the line model costs close to 6k usd.

It’s just a useless highly priced item that no one asked for lol

I&#39;m still struggling to get a ps4 and im seeing this giant consoles combined gaming machine. Its too bad. I bet this machine is gonna cost thousands of dollars

<a href="">3:29</a>I actually thought the thing was gonna break when he docked the switch.

ME: WOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH.<a href="">3:29</a>. ;D

Nintendo and PlayStation all you need

So, that&#39;s what NASA uses!?

I love my big 1/3 O that is PlayStation

Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Is xbox really necessary? I mean you can play halo, forza etc. on windows.

i need this nowwwwww OMG

Then. Find rassbery pi plus Windows

I just realised, money can buy happiness!!

Respect

Coolest console of all time 

How can I get that one. I want the all in one.

So many fucking cords

When it lags

U have power use wisley

Controllers should also be common for all consoles.

How did you get both PS4 and Xbox One? When I go to buy it it only lets me buy one or the other

good for gamer youtubers

The big ooooh boy!

Starting price: your soul

Look at the knife 

This is crazy and awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I wonder if sheldon cooper invented it

I hope they still sell this pc

But like let me get this bro 

Nice, all in one gaming device!

Me: So how much does it cost?Origin: It&#39;s awesome right?

noo it is known as 2 Boxens

I want that unboxing knife he used

all the systems together is less than 2 grand.

but, the ps5 is coming out... 

New Studio is amazing

Does he keep all this shit?

Your wire management gives me <b>aids</b>

This is called sick design bro!!

Why do you unbox these things when 97 percent of your subs can&#39;t afford these

Payment methods-:• MasterCard• Visa• Slavery for 7 Generations
Imagine playing super Mario in this setup

Starting price : bent over
Loved the dog at the end

Does anybody know what game he was playing in the pc

that is the new definition of gaming master race !

The guy sitting in couch and playing spider man in green shirt .. is he is the same one designed a kindle Inapired phone .. both look same 

It may be big but, the price is way bigger

Should have waited 1 more year, imagine it having a ps5 in there

Something made for the minecraft better-together update

I like the fact that he is playing spiderman in the background (<a href="">5:00</a>)

The internet&#39;s fakest salesman

The amount of pleasure this video has given me is orgasmic.

I cried a little, I would suspect if Jesus was a Pc this would be him in all his glory

How much money would it cost to build this?

It would be more impressive if they just built one mega cpu and GPU that plays them both, xbox1, X ,playstation 2,3 &amp; 4.And we just use our own ram cartridges and our own M.2 memory

I may just have an orgasm. That was graphic.

thats  illegal

So it is literally priceless because this is a one of, and they are not planning to make anymore. This was a tribute for their 10 anniversary as a company I believe.But doing a fast ballpark estimate including the components retail price and including unique design features I would say north of 10000$ but could be much more, absolute minimum would be 8000$.

PC2 CONFIRMED 2020

The humming was funny

What if PlayStation 5 and new Xbox and android arcade 999 pc

But can it beat goku though?

2070 kid - my watch is move powerful than this box of tin.

Video starts: <a href="">0:00</a>Me: sorry i had tacos

get the BESTEST, MOST EXPENSIVE BATTERY BANK, PLUG TO THIS BAD BOI! AND BAM, IT&#39;S A REAL &quot;ALL-IN-ONE&quot; PORTABLE GAMING SYSTEM! (you&#39;d be broke by now begging for money on the street or making gaming vids for a living)

cool, but why would you need an xbox there if you can play their games on windows 10?

Hey,just wondering if you want to give it away

Like if PS5 is a reality.

I bet they regret buying this now! Hahahaha! Ps5 baby!

Thats nice would have bought it a few years ago. Not now Im into powerful pcs.

I&#39;m watching this after ps5 is announced

You cant even get this specific desktop

Every Gamer&#39;s Greatest Dream:

hi, suggest you review mumba grip case and carry box, they are great.

Wait its only $2000 tho that’s basically 2 iPhones

The Outdated once new systems come out

This pc is more expensive than my house

What monitor were they using for over watch?

i may have missed it but if you connect multiple screens can you play more than 1 console at once?

Could&#39;ve just duct taped the consoles on the pc setup

Overkill is not in this computer&#39;s vocabulary
