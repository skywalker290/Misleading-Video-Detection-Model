Why Hindi actors and actress talk in English when everyone around them knows hindi...

These are the actors i admire and look forward to their work...this is a real round table of actors...just miss Irfaan khan sir here...wish he was here...

The keen learning capability of Saif overshadowed everyone, it shows he is experienced...

Damn! Saif is so cute!

<a href="">23:25</a> Bharat Muni ka Natya Shastra Saif be like yeh kya hota h bc
Pratik Gandhi ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just stumbled upon it. Watched it through.  Amazing talented bunch of people. Always enjoy just discussions in any field whatsoever.

Saif is awesome man! 😍

🙏

manoj bajpayee, vijay raaz and kay kay menon should have been here

Half of this panel was part of GOW - now we know that GOW was a multi-starrer 😀

Munna bhaiya 🔥🔥
Sir sir, it is fun to see the big bat by respecting the other person...what a wonderful actor's mind you are.
A list actors.... IRFFAN IS MISSING 😢😢😢😢
Manoj vajpayee, ali fazal and abhishek banerjee should also have been here

Saif will learn from everyone and become a good actor.
Saif is so appreciative of others🥰

all of them were from the humble batch of super talented actors kept together ..

<a href="">1:07:41</a>

<a href="">1:03:48</a>

<a href="">1:02:29</a>

I know this much is trueSpy Trans (Malyalam)

<a href="">22:01</a> Thug Life

Saif never fails to impress there is so much to his personality

What saif is doing there...

Gems ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Prateek’s performance was the best of the lot .. one for the ages

I really loved Rajkumar Rao and kunal khemu role s

Saif ko chodake sab selfmade

@<a href="">50:24</a> pankajji: correct correct ;D

It’s so fascinating to see that 4 out of the  8 actors on the panel were a part of Gangs of Wasseypur:Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Faizal KhanJaideep Ahlawat as Shahid Khan (Faizal Khan’s grandfather)Pankaj Tripathi as Sultan QureshiRajkummar Rao as Shamshad AlamMany people don’t know but even Vicky Kaushal worked as an Assistant Director for the film.Gangs of Wasseypur was really a goldmine of the country’s finest actors.

Here for Divyendu 💪
I just came here to listen Jaideep Ahlawat and pratik...

Such a brat..this stupid saif is....I am just hating these khans...rest are just awesome 👌

How divyendu is saying ‘Nawaz bhai Mirzapur dekhna aur message karna’ is amazing

It felt like watching a youtube short..

<a href="">45:30</a>

So Intellectually Engaging Conversation and Loved the Way Saif being Curious Cat in this Conversation.

Yeah this is a master class for me

Rajeev masand roundtable somehow manages us to give acting lessons and knowledge of acting world while the interview is being carried out. Amazing to watch such great actors talk about acting.

Am I the only one who is watching this in Loop 🔁? ❤

The moment when u realise this...Saif and Kunal are saala jiju....😊😊😊

Hindi actors talking english 😂
<a href="">45:00</a>

Best roundtable watching again and again

Saif has too much attitude and trying to be most important as always. He should really be taught a lesson on humility

Irrfan Sir would be so proud 🙂

Almost everyone saying jaise raj ne kaha jaise raj ne kaha...It shows the amount of respect rajkumar rao is having among actors

Honestly I liked it when saif was straight and asked Raj to answer a simple question. Because yes he&#39;s a great actor but he should also learn to answer simply and not complicate. So great saif

Best roundtable so far, I think pankaj tripathi should host a show and all the actors from this video should be the guest.

Scam 1992 :- pratik gandhi
All actor is legend

Hands down the best Actors Roundtable I&#39;ve seen.

This was one of the best interviews I have ever seen. Such amazing talent all of them!! Jaideep Ahlawat is such an amazing actor and star besides being humble and intelligent too. His performances  whether Raazi , pataal lok or ajeeb dastaan has been excellent..super se bhi upar. He was perfectly crowned by all the others as the best actor for Pataal lok.  Saif  and Prateek looked so much in awe of him..That man bun also looks amazing on him. Pankaj Tripathi was also amazing..Loved the fact that he loves reading hindi literature. Saif took over and broke the ice among them and made the conversation really comfortable rather than structured..Loved it!

A great Saif death scene was in Kurbaan

I m not a person who would watch a video for more than 10-15 min in one go…but I couldn’t even pause this one even once…Truly inspiring,informative,raw and justified A listers at the round table 👏🏻

Iam here for kunal khemu

One of the best round table

Thats why i love saif

best ever roundtable I&#39;ve seen till date &lt;3
Should call them again with jeetu bhaiya too..

Omg the way he spoke...this proves nepotism doesn&#39;t matter.

pratik real age is 41but looks like 31

<a href="">26:40</a> Pankaj ji fun moment
munna bhaiya soo cute
Reshmi has hair, Pankaj Tripathi innocence is next level☺️☺️
Reshmi baal he iske toh reshmi baal 🤣🤣🤣Pankaj ji is Lit🔥
Awesome talk by all.All are so accomplished actors that it becomes tough to choose among em.Some are new and some are experienced actors.I wonder when all the actors are Indian and all know hindi then why all are speaking in English.I guess Rajeev the host of the show doesnt speak hindi.

Lovely conversation!

Good to see pratik on this platform.

Here only for pratik sir

Lovely ..

Jeetu is not brother? Had good time watching it..
Saif too good talk also😂 amazing

Saif can play the character of Jocker if made in Bollywood.... He has that vibe ...and got it naturally

Saif is oldest and most curious in this pannel

Nawazuddin sir is like ..yea kya bol raha hain ulta sidha ..other be like kya ho raha hain vai 🤣😆
I enjoyed technicaity  if the roundtable, but for me at 57.05  saif enjoying chacha  dialouge  was extraordinary

I like this bcz Saif is trying to understand the others views

Missing Irrfan Khan and Manoj Bajpayee in this panel..

What Kunal Khemu is doing here in A - list conference 😂😂

If you want to learn acting these actor will teach you about acting since they are so experienced. Who agrees?

<a href="">1:00:46</a> nawajh bhai very close to say that mar na bsdk 😂🤣🤣😂

Enjoyed this roundtable immensely! Saif really broke the ice and made this roundtable come together in such a candid and effortless way. Looking forward for more such stuff! ♥️

Pankaj tripathi has no chill😂😂😂😂

Nawaz is on another level!

I watched full episode, after that I watched scam 1992 and again watching this episode. Hats off to Pratik…!

Awesome interview on YouTube good to watch

Pankaj tripathi thug life ❤️❤️
Thanks for conducting this interview in English just in case England&#39;s Queen is watching. 🤡

Ae Wow!

only manoj sir missing

The actor who has spoken in Hindi is good and dry. Niraj Chopra 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Pankaj ji, Rajkumar, Nawaz, Pratik &amp; Divyendu...Bliss to watch these awesome actors😍

Kaleen bahaiya and faizal khan 👍👍♥️♥️❤️
I was overwhelmed

They&#39;re all so decent, actually trying to listen &amp; learn from each other

Pankaj Tripathi is such a darling person...so cute &amp; innocent 😇❤️

Legends not using earbuds

Under rated of 4 khans is in the 3 of The Khans is Saif always proofs his worth ofcourse All of them are Masterpiece in their own 🔥

Kunal is probably the most under-appreciated.

All of these guys have so many gems to offer for aspiring actors... The way they break down different scenes... themes etc... fascinating

Saif is such a gentleman ❤️

<a href="">59:00</a> i think he is talking about the white tiger

This is so much fun. It&#39;s seriously like minded people having just a genuine discussion and having fun.

At first, I thought Saif was being really rude and I really like him and it made me sad. But then I realised he is just genuinely curious. He wants to learn more from the actors. I think one of the reason is that he came from a very different kind of background. All the other actors have a really different filmography from him.

Nawaz &amp; Pankaj such an natural actors, a gem💎 of bollywood..❤

Didn&#39;t know Saif has that eager or hunger of knowing and getting the details and information indeed sharing his idea and view or opinions... Specially enjoying like a kid😂... Hails to all the great actors 🙌🙌🙌

Don&#39;t you find Ajay Devgan better than many of these actors????

Truly, a masterclass for any aspiring actors 👏

Maturity is when u realize that these actors are infinitely  more talented than starkids

Saif really broke the ice between all of them, It&#39;s good to see real actors interacting together in a conversation.

English and all is cool pr Pankaj sir ki HINDI seedhe dil ko chuuti h😍😍

Truly the &quot;actors&quot; of the year! Enjoyed the convo

Saif was nt part of the conversation at 24 mins so he interjected by saying it is a privellege to be here and killed the vibe he does that because he likes to be part of conversation does our ladla nawwab he&#39;s such a obnoxious person

Very enjoyable man👌🏻🙋🏻‍♂️
I enjoyed lot this interview

This was the best roundtable 👍🏼🔥

Saif&#39;s sense of humour is impeccable 😂👍🏼🔥

Where is manoj bajpai

Pankaj Tripathi the legend 😂

Video start at <a href="">4:00</a>
When saif said &quot; bhosdiwaale uncle&quot; that was ultimate 😂 and the way he has given the respect to other actors in the panel shows his class

Need solid web-series with all of this guys together.

I think- it’s not Rajiv’s round it’s  Saif’s round table. 😂 He is having a good time and enjoying this conversation with all the good actors.

Manoj Bajpayee is missing.

Hathiram for sure

The most enjoyable and insightful roundtable. All the actors had fun and were respectful towards each other. Their laugh brought a smile on my face as well.

Shahid Khan,Faizal Khan and Sultan Qureshi and Shamshad Alam in one frame :)

Pankaj Tripathi sir &quot; "What did you say to me?"
Nawazuddin Siddiqui sir 🔥🔥
Omg Pratik Gandhi so proud of him he deserve more 🔥🔥

It really sticks in the family in Saif Sirs Case, as Kunal is his brother-in-law😜

Pankaj sir mentioned NILOTPAL. MRINAAL  it&#39;s great....it&#39;s nice to read his books 👍🏼

This round table was so much fun 😂

Nawaz put glasses so people hire him in this kind of character too 😏

Not an actor. But felt like I&#39;m learning from these great actors. Their views of lives have some lessons too.

Loved Saif in it...he is like guys we are just actors not space scientist...I think u guys need to loosen a bit 😂😂😂

The best video call ive seen ever 😃👌👌👌

Such a good watch!

I usually dnt comment but i just cant stop myself after seeing saif.. he is such a happy soul.. he is enjoying very much. He is asking questions like a newcomer into the Industry nd with so mch innocence... I just love this guy from now..

Missing two legends in this roundtable  Irrfan Khan &amp;  Manoj Bajpayee

I'm just missing Manoj bajpayee sir yrr🥺🥺
<a href="">22:01</a> 😂😂😂😂

Saif seems quite jumpy
<a href="">27:45</a> <b>Acting is not a wrestling</b> kya line boli hai pankaj sir ne !
One of the most interesting roundtables.

Saif Ali Khan was so excited and happy to be apart of this is so heartwarming to watch because he himself is such a big actor but not a single percent did he act superior and in fact was ready to learn from the rest of the actors, this is not something I have seen in other big actors that often.

Now this is a round table conference which is oozing with talent, hard work, dedication and struggle. The way they spoke so passionately made me wanting to hear more. Absolutely brilliant.

This is one of the most candid Rountable I’ve seen. These guys are real and that’s their beauty.

The actors are called as Male actors and female actors everywhere now, not hero n heroine. This shows bollywood has grown

Jija sala ekhi video me Saif and kunal

Pankaj Tripathi is so innocent and funny..😄🥰

<a href="">1:07:24</a> IKTMIT

Probably the best podcast / round table 🙌🙌

Sardar ji + ganesh gaytandu 😂
Thousand time better than coffee with karan

All is favorite

Lovely

Munna bhaiya 🔥
Jaideep is very down to earth person

Amazing
Rajeev sir this is the first roundtable i have ever watched just because of the faces coj it was totally talent struck roundtable , and during the whole session i never felt that i am a viewer i really felt that i was a part of this roundtable  got to learn so many things from this session keep doing this kind of session also i would like to share if u can pass on the message it would b great that saif sir was incredible in lal kaptaan what a performance

<a href="">54:45</a> Pankaj ji OP!  😍🔥🔥
One of the best round table great job 👍👏

Nawaz and Saif are actually making notes.

we can expect a talk show of SAIF on star world in future, &quot;THE SAIF ALI KHAN SHOW&quot;

All actor wonderful 👌👌👌
A bunch of incredible talent. Mind blowing talent. Best round table.

what is the name of series which Rajkumar Rao said in the last question ???

There should be a movie with Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Pankaj Tripathi in it, both legends!

In 59.18 Rajkumar is referring to his character Ashok in The White Tiger, the context about doing a dying scene.

Can u believe pratik is 40 ???!!?
Such a brilliant selection for this round table. Bravo 👏🏻

That&#39;s the trick khemu don&#39;t answer questionSaif is spot on

After that Ramuji started doing a lot of drama, Pankaj ji is spot on.
Jaideep has very deep macho voiceHe is like Gentle Beast

All the nepo free people with so much talent in one frame... ❤️ Respect

Here for saif

Munna bhai beautifullllllllllllllllllll
<a href="">8:46</a> &#39;this guy also said&#39;😂😂 pratik doesn&#39;t know kunal.

Even if saif Ali khan is a victim of nepotism he has proved himself as the best and versatile actor. Does someone agree?

I started liking saif after he visited my hometown pasighat, Arunachal pradesh to shoot his movie rangoon.He is such a humble person.

pratik is awesome work 🙌😊

Serious Men!!

Pratik ne Kuch Kaha aur all time saif laughing that&#39;s not good

Practice 👍🤘🙌
Pratik! Pratik!!! Aaahh

Real actors - how refreshing!

All were amazing, I was surprised that no one voted saif&#39;s character in Tanaji, He totally killed it, Amazing..he was so entertaining and into the skin of character, great..Everyone was fantastic though..🙌

Am here for pratik 😍

Kunal Kemmu and SaifJija and sala

Pankaj tripathi is so endearing

Saif is SO SO SO CUTE. My heart is full watching him. Wholesome video 💜

nawaz is king of acting...

I enjoyed this roundtable a lot

GOW in the middle 🔥❣️

This was the best roundtable didn’t get bored for a moment . Amazing artist

Saif was fab in this...

<a href="">59:30</a> The White Tiger

Saif is a genuine person glad to see him among such fine actors 😃😃😃

Nawaj bhai be like: kahi chasma na gir jaye bc

All legendary actor of Bollywood are together ❤️

Saif is very genuine guy

Imagine all of this actors coming together for a movie/series 😍

All actor❤️❤️👍🙏 great performances
Pankaj tripaathi got no chill 😂

Practice 😀
Saif is my kindred spirit. Of course the lockdown has been difficult but I actually didn&#39;t hate it as much as people everywhere were cribbing about it!

All legends are in single fame

I have no words how good actor Pratik Gandhi is! He has already made big and would be more successful and popular soon❤️

Pratik Gandhi ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am not here for saif ali khan.. i am here for the rest of the talented in bollywood actors and i am very happy that things are changing in bollywood

This is real actor event 🙌🙌

So many talents in one screen.. What a moment

It&#39;s jst awesome to listen each views

Others are great actor too but here for Mr. Big Bull.

Pankaj ji didn't understand much.
Really enjoyable

Literally Pratik is such a inspiration ❤️ His smile is the reward what he struggled for so many years ✨

Jaydeep man ....so happy that lately we are getting to see real talent and they are getting recognised...❤️

Rajkumar Rao ❣❣❣❣❣
Came here for pankaj tripathy and pratik gandhi.

Who recognised Sultan QuresiShamshad AlamFaizal Khan andShahid Khan  in the meet?

Arshad warsi in asur .He was awesome

Divyendu i liked his perfomance

Me: Not for pratik, only for pratik gandhi.

It was wonderful to watch the amazing camaraderie amongst the colleagues.

Who was only waiting to see Pratik

These are the actors that India deserves...

I wish this video could&#39;ve been much longer, so so good

saif is d most genuine n down to earth guy, apart from pankaj

What about taish

petition to see pratik gandhi and nawazuddin in a same film

<a href="">24:57</a> tripathiji was on point🥰

pratik is such an innocent

I lovw the way how talent struck saif was after pankaj tripathi&#39;s comment on laughter and tearful take.. he was totally struck by his inyelligence and loved the way he took time to appreciate being in his presence!!

<a href="">22:03</a> pankaj tripathi
Love is Watching PANKAJ TRIPATHI , RAJKUMAR RAO , DIVYENDU SHARMA, NAWAZ IN ONE FRAME

Best roundtable ever ,they were genuinely enjoying with each other

No one watched Peaky Blinders I guess

Is it just me or is Pankaj Tripathi too cute! 😄

A collection of the finest ones was a treat to watch

i think saif is only actor who had most diversified characters and some risky choices in past decade....

<b>PRATIK, DIVEYNDU and TRIPATHI Ji</b>

Saif is so cute and intellectual guy...and pankaj tritpathi is same too.😍😍

I just paused the video and checked eveybody&#39;s reaction again and again after each comment Mr. Pankaj Tripathi.He is a philosopher I must say..

The most intellectual, engaging and enjoyable discussion. Credit goes to all these brilliant actors for making it meaningful and finally seeing true talent being recognized.

Rajkumar Rao is so over rated

These are the real actors of Bollywood.

Saif 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Never enjoyed so much while watching a talkshow or any roundtable..

Saif is the best entertainer

Saif and Ajay Devgan are like fine getting older becoming fine

Jeetu is missing

Only harshad mehta🖤🖤🖤😭😭😭😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤
Missing varun dhawan in discussion
<a href="">35:32</a> At this time I am enjoying more than ever listening to the stories of pure divine Kunal Pratik.
Gaitonde, kaleen bhaiya, sartaj,  hathiram, munna ,newton

Pratik Gandhi and Pankaj Tripathi has the purest soul and most joyful vibes !

someone please fix Nawaz&#39;s glasses

Only here for Saif aka Ranveer singh...

I’m so glad actual talent. And not the so called stars, star kids are here. These people are the real stars! How the times have changed.

This is the talented   Round table.

Saif really has a intelligent brother-in-law in Kunal... Kunal should be appreciated even more

Here for Kunal!!
How to find those glasses wore by Saif sir?

Nawaz n Pankaj ji ❤️
After seen this interview I m going to watch ..a Web Series  &quot;I know this much is True&quot; 👍👍

Pura Sansar bol rha h.. Pratik is the best.... ❤️

Harshad Mehta
Hi Rajeev ,when will you invite Kartik Aryaan in your show ,dont you think he is capable ?

Amit Sadh is missing here.❤️

saif was like a fan whose come across all his favourite stars at once and was eager to know everything.

Love you Rajkumar ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Loved watching this. A tad disappointed though that none of them mentioned a female actor’s performance

One of the best roundtable. Artists💕

I am a simple person whenever I see Pankaj ji, I click it. Loved this person for everything.

4 are from gang of wasseypur only..kudos to Anurag kashyap in shaping thr future ahead...

<a href="">1:02:54</a> really want to know when did it actually end. Pankaj ji kitna late huye 🤣

Where is prithik Gandhi

BEST ROUNDTABLE EVER....!!!!

saif&#39;s tandav is amazing guys

I am missing Irfan Khan.
I&#39;m glad that my favourite actors are getting invitation in such shows now. People are respecting real talent now.

Scam 1992

They did great work in their respective shows and movies

<a href="">21:28</a> Nawazuddin be like: Mujhe Niche se dhekne ka hai😂😂

I like saif more than ajay in tanaji....anyone agree

I don&#39;t know if I am the only oneBut I missed Sushant while watching this. ❤️

What is Kunal Khemu doing in this...discussion...

Saif sir acting in tana ji is awesome

Ye log itne acche acche baatein bole hain toh mein aur kya bolu

I watched I know this much is true as recommended by Rao

Pratik is best , as acting is between shouting ,crying , anger and laugh .

I loveed Saif in this roundtable!! He is too cool.

Pure actors of Bollywood 👌

This table is every second entertaining avery one is fine actors

Isn’t saif out of place

The background of each one says a lot

All Legends in one frame 🖼

Pankaj Tripathi maintaining the diplomacy

<a href="">57:05</a> for chacha dialogue
All talented actors deserve to be in this roundtable conference

I only want to listen to Pratik 🤩

Pankaj is just great, he is very intelligent and honest.

<a href="">1:12:27</a>....reshmi bal hain iske to ..reshmi baal .... PANKAJSIRtoHATHIRAAM🤣🤣🤣
<a href="">22:00</a> Everyone started laughing 😂😂

What a roundtable ♥️🔥
Pankaj sir best 👍💜 original 🙏
Saif Ali can be a great host for a talk show.

All are our favorite actors 😒🥰😍🤩😘😘😘❤❤❤❤
The best is Pankaj Tripathi ji as always my favorite,,,all are my favorite but Pankaj ji sab se alag hai, he is one of our favorite from Canada 🇨🇦

All are our favorite, we never missed their tv series. Even we miss movie but never missed tv series....they all are legend 🙌 👏 ❤ ♥ 👍👍👍🤘🤘🤘

Please get khurrana bros on here too. Very humble boys.

Good to see people really see wht a fine and a mature actor saif ali khan has grown into.. had started to think that it&#39;s only me or what!!! Ofcourse the rest of the panel is amazing too.. like Gandhi, Ahlawat, came across as amazing actors in 2020!! Pankaj Tripathi is next level!! But I really appreciate Saif Ali Khan, he comes across as a well-read, cultured, well-travelled person who is sometimes a delight to listen to, unlike how people perceive him most of the times, i.e a spoilt brat and nothing more than product of nepotism.. but he has grown as an actor, for eg. Loved him in Laal Kaptan!!!

This is totally amazing

Who is here for Pratik Gandhi?

Nawaz sir ki English is very good yaar..!!

Best roundtable ever ❤️
Harshad bhai nu rajma market majama who all came here for prateek gandhi.

Underrated actors

All good actors

yaar itni jyda acting ek screen pe...wow!!!!

Don&#39;t know why but felt so good watching saif 😍 changed my mentality about him

Saif is such a fun around guy

Only for pratik

I&#39;m here just bcoz of pratik Gandhi ❤

Best of the current lot

This is by far the best and the most genuine actors roundtable !

Kya bhaiya sab bade bade chacha h iss round table me toh..bole talent vaale

Middle raw me gangs of Wasseypur wale bethe he😂

Scam 1992, Mirzapur, Newton, Sacred Games, LUDO and many more (comprising primarily of the actors in this panel) got me through weeks and days. Authentic Indian television series are such a treat and something to feel proud about!

A compliment from Nawaz Sir..basss kafi hai! Congo Pratik :)

&quot;After that Ramuji started doing more drama&quot; 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Jokes apart, what a conversation. wow just a bunch of whole talented people inspiring a lot out there. This means that if one team works in a film, it will be like a dream team.
Legends say that Nawazuddin Siddiqui is still adjusting his spectacles

The flag of honesty was raised….. Lol
I hv massive respect n love for Saif after watching this for so many reasons 💖

All are best❤️

Pankaj😂😂

Dibyendu 😂🔥
This guy is not a humanHe seems to me from some different world, maybe different time with a clear perspective of how the world is and how the world should beAnd the best thing is he shows it through a visual mediumI am not even qualified to praise himJust can sit on the sidelines and adore him , cherish his work.Thank u NOLAN for giving us new meaning to our lives with your films♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

Please try 🙏🏼
Saif&#39;s humour, intellectual 🔥🔥🔥
But this Year* Best Series - Scam 1992* Best Movies - Ludo/Tanaji

Talent overloaded....

Every one enjoys the round table

in a world of wireless earphones seeing nawaz wearing wired earphones gives so much satisfaction.

Pankaj as a person is too good to be true!

Saif is the most interesting person in this panel.

Great, there are actors not stars❤️❤️❤️❤️
I missed Sharman Joshi...Kay Kay Menon and Prashant Narayan here

No One:Pankaj Tripathi: You said so much, what did you say to me?
This was really a great panel with diverse group of actors that are all talented in their own unique way. 👍

We want Part 2 of it✌️

Just imagine a movie made with all these superstars in cast. Epic

Saif is charming ❤️
Pankaj tripathi&#39;s interview is always a treat to watch ♥️

<a href="">57:03</a> Why Saif is straight up lovable... Man can switch from  class to mass instantly..

I&#39;m Big Fan of Pratik from scam1992.. excellent Work Pratik......GBU..

We are glad ke hum pratik ko jante hai.we have seen him growing.

How ever you take it. Every year, best actors. Half of them will be the cast of gangs of wasseypur. Such a great cast it had.

Pankaj is such a cutie 🥰

Best episode ever
I missed Irrfan Khan. I would have laughed 10 times more at his jokes ... May his soul Rip.

I did not know that Kunal was Saif&#39;s Jiju

Ranbir kapoor , raj kumar rao, b jeetu bhaiya damn panchayat  he is also a gem

Nawazuddin : Wired earphonesSaif : Speaker 😂😂

Saif sir how much unsolicited moderation do you do? I told you that's it.
LOVE ALL❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nawaz got an ill fitting glasses probably online. Kept adjusting it every 30 secs. He should get it changed.

everyone are legends 🔥🔥
Love Saif❤️
I felt like seeing Prateek here.
Jija sala same table par 😂😂😂
Jiju and Saale Saheb In first row 😍😍😍

Best Interview ever of 2020 ..!

one of the best rountables. all seemed so genuine in their conversation and it felt so natural

Divyendu&#39;s kya at <a href="">1:05:57</a> was SOO GOOD😂😂

I am here for harshad mehta the pg

I am here only for prathik gandhi.....

Pratik is so confident. Speaks so well👍🏽
One of the finest self driven interviews.. Free flowing and uncomplicated. Amazing pool of actors. Ek se badhkar ek. Saif Ali Khan has commendable &quot;running a show&quot; skill.. Something he is better at than other khans. Personally I have watched all of them featuring these actors. Scam1992, Mirzapur, Paatal lok, serious men... Great ones..thanks alot for making our lockdown engaging!!

Please watch trance, the malayalam movie

All genuine actors are their.Great to see.

Legends in one frame

Never enjoyed a round table more .. like the people on it too 😄

This is such a family episode baap beta dada pota aur jija saala

Pankaj tripathi is the most grounded actor and the fact that I can understand his interactions the most proves the fact

How about a round table of male and female actors together. I have watched both the videos back to back and enjoyed. ButI wonder how the conversation will go when both were combine.

This is what we want as an interview or conversation.....perfect round-table with most amazing actors..... love for Divyendu 😘

I am here only to watch &amp; listen pratik gandhi😎

Reshmi baal 😁😁
Jaideep and his hair ❤️❤️

After watching this amazing conversation for few minutes.. I felt like : &quot;man!!  Its not me it&#39;s Entire bollywood stars* who should watch this on loop.. 😅 😅&quot;So that they will get some basics..

Best a actors
Pratik Gandhi, scam1992 acting legendary ..live from Gujrat

Kunal and pratik ❤️
Power House of talent😍

Jaideep and Pratik ❤❤
What a fun conversation that was! Saif your chill is contagious!

What’s Saif is smoking? Kuch bhi Bol raha hai.

Saif definitely pre-gamed this

this was a great interview!!!!!,,, prateek gandhi and jaideep stand out... All the fine actors born to rule the cinemas... much better than some of the khans....

Nawazuddin looks so insecure as actor and animated in his answers

I can listen to them for 5 hours. It&#39;s so fascinating and interesting.

I really appreciate that pratik Ghandhi is considered as a good actor 👍👍

Reminded me of placement moderated Group discussion where every student is trying to come up with a different point

Great video.... should be done often

Pankaj sir is so down to earth yaar.

I just saw the title and i was very excited to watch video then it started serious as well as funny and i paused there and thought i will watch this full and thats amazing what a humour of pankaj tripathi

<a href="">51:19</a> Nawaz sir spoke my heart out
Oh Kunal Khemu.
Excellent interaction. Saif is amazing as Lyangra Tyagi. Kunal is very cute admiring actor since his childhood. Rajkumar is my fav frm this genrtn. Pankaj ji is awesome

Go Goa Gone is a winner

I like Nawazuddin Siddiqui simplicity wearing Normal earphones
Saif steals the table❤️🔥

I really respect saif for saying yes to be in this panel

Is diveyendu wearing the same shirt he wears as Munna Bhaiya?😂

This bad thing happened Masand Sahab. <b>wasseypur reference</b>
I&#39;m totally agree with Saif and Pankaj

I know this much is trueSpy

Only here for pratik gandhi😂❤️🔥
I know a scene from Superstar where Kunal makes fun of &quot;act they are shooting&quot; and says Aisa kaun baat karta hain Yaar and then laughs he is so genuine at keeping the nuonces, what an actor Kunal is so understated he is a born actor

The moment when saif interrupted pratik was really annoying 🙄

Pankaj sir u r great 👏👏
Indian English - you know you know you know

Rajeev sir please give space for the characters from the web series Undekhi Divyendu Bhattacharya and Surya Sharma

Ayushman Khurrana is missing...
Jaideep Ahlawat Sir...🔥🙏😎
So enjoying episode rajeev sir but missing Late Irfan khan♥️...Everyone is best in this episode and my favorite Nawaj ji, Rajkumar, Pankaj ji, they are together.

I love how this just became a conversation between the actors. Appreciate Rajeev moderating this, but also loved Saif’s intellectual questions and he was even taking notes- wow mashallah, love the guy.

I puked my guts out laughing in that baloon scene in DCH 😂

Finally a group of Original Bollywood actors ❤️✨

Pankaj tripaathi awesome👍👍👍
Finallllllly i see the real actors

Saif n pankaj r so cute yaar n i m missing irfan khan badly in this conversation

A fan of each one of them but rn here just for pratik ❤❤

This roundtable was by far the best, Rajeev. Now, this is the kind of conversation that actors should have amongst themselves. Pankaj&#39;s gem of a line &quot;acting is not like wrestling, where one actor is trying to defeat the other, but it is both the actors complementing each other to make the scene what it deserves to be&quot;. Too good❤️

Pratikkkkkkk 💙💙
Munna bhaiya...will tear everyone's ass
Rajkumar next superstar...if he can survive.

Man how amazing this was.❤️

How beautifully Pankaj Tripathi talks ❤️

Saif is the only true actor and star we deserve... He doesn&#39;t belong to the big Khan community as they are just stars but he is a phenomenal actor before a star...

so much talent in a single frame

Nobody is talking about jaydeep ahlawat...

I feel this is the only channel and only host who ask relevant questions and not flirty or very personal one. He is very mature and ofcourse experienced which makes his work even more interesting. And also I&#39;ve never seen rajkumar, pankaj sir and pratik open with any other host than you. Kudos to you sir I like your work a lot!!!❤👍

Pratik you made us proud love from Ahmedabad

Kunal khemmu...main so jaata hoon a little😁
Pratik Gandhi... All the way..... Very underrated

Heart pounds for.. pratik Gandhi and Kunal khemmu
This was your best roundtable

This is one of the best Roundtable episodes so far for me , thoroughly enjoyed it without a skip..❤️

At <a href="">47:03</a> &quot;illuminati spotted&quot;.
Irrfan sir missing 😢😢
So much talent in one frame!!!

Saif ali khan is so awesome ... ???? ...:)😃

This is a real Bollywood...LEGENDS

Hopefully Pratik will become a big actor !

Pratik Gandhi life has taken a 180 degree turn.

Absolutely fantastic

Right Nawaz <a href="">53:00</a>
Who is here after seeing Pratik in thumbnail?

Prateek ke liy is frame me aana is big achievement and he deserves it. 🙏👏👏👏

Saif busted Rajkumar😂🤣Rajkumar really didn&#39;t make any sense on Cricket comment🤣

Finally actors on roundtable and not the stars❤️🙏🏻

How can Saif or anyone forget his death scene in Race 2. That scene alone is better than Salman Khan&#39;s whole career 😂

Actors roundtable ya Gangs of wasseypur reunion?

Out of them 4 got their fame from gangs of wasseypur, thank you to anurag sir for finding these gems

Bhaiya main bhaiya Munna bhaiya
One of the best...Irfan, pankaj, jaideep, Jeetu, manoj vajpeyi, rajkumar, Ali Faisal, dwiyendu,Rajat Kapoor, Ranveer shorey, Nawaj, Saurabh Mishra, saif (lal kaptaan), Prateek...India is proud of these actors...

4 actors worked in gangs of Wasseypur.

Rajeev finally got some sense and invited legit actors for the actors roundtable

I only watched Pratik Gandhi ❤😍

When nawaj sir talks about natyashastra  , saif was like- ye kya cheej hai maine toh kbhi sunni nhi.

Everyone is so excited and mutual respect to each other

Pankaj Tripathi, Saif ❤❤❤❤
The amount of talent in this stream😱

Reshmi baal hai iske to rehmi baal.... Has separate fan base
Kunal's Kemmu'
All my favourite actors

<a href="">1:02:41</a>  pankaj tripathi op😂😂
Pankaj tripathi the coolest guy of the class

Enjoy lot of...

Now I understand why Kaleen bhaiya is Pankaj Sir&#39;s one of the best work. He doesn&#39;t have to speak more..just his nods😂❤️

Only one super star was there who now himself wants to be the actor

Always 10 times better than the girls one , Is it only me or the guys are much easier ? Haha 😂 funny stuff

Awesome , best interview ever👍

Check Pankaj Tripathi&#39;s cheeky funny moment at <a href="">1:02:25</a>

I think the best web series to come out of India would be Delhi Crime

Honour to watch❤️
<a href="">4:00</a>

BRILLIANT!!!!!

We don’t really acknowledge the efforts put in by rajeev bringing the talent together and asking them such intriguing and detailed questions. I love watching actors roundtable and that too with rajeev there 🙌🏼

Enjoyed this conversation! Loveedddd loved loved it!

Pankaj Tripathi having water from the peetal glass is the vibe to 2021 for me.

Jaideep truly was amazing in Paatallok...sadly the series got meddled in controversial things and took the shine off him..

Divyendu is right..his death scene was seriously mediocre...it could have been way more dramatic 🙄

Lootcase is an awesome film, it&#39;s not always drama genre who should be the contender

Thank you Rajeev for this.

I think saif was too talkative 😑

Too much talent in one frame

I have so much respect for saif coz he brought up &quot;Bhosdiwale chacha&quot;

Maja agya thanks sir

Like IPL is for cricket OTT and youtube is for actors.

Why is Nawaz holding his glass continuously....

One of the best videos of 2020, Great Cast insanely talented people 🔥🔥🔥

Wish irfan was also part of this discussion. Irfan’s going away was like a personal loss for me ... miss u irfan

It was a lovely video! I wished Jitendra Kumar was included in this as well...his work in Panchayat is full of simplicity and splendour

Sooo good!

Great to see best actors together! Pratik is very talented and I am so happy to see him paving his way to top level actors. He deserves it!

How I miss Irrfan Sir here 😭😭💔

Pratik Gandhi❤️❤️
Pure Gold. Really Thankful to all of them this year.

Saif and Kunal might as well discuss this over the family dinner table....lol...

Saif is such a intelligent thoughtful person.  No substitute for a great education.

Jitu is also missing, he has done some amazing work in Panchayat.

If only irrfan was there too💔💔🥺

This was awesome 👏🏼

Gold

This was SOOOO FUN!

Amazing 👌
Amazing conversation 👍
can we have film of saif n pratik on same screen

This roundtable is ❤️

Pratik yarrr 🙌
So good to see saif.. Being an A lister. Joining this round table with new and talented artists.

Me to the comment section:&quot;Sab ne bohot achi achi baatein kardi, main kya kahun&quot;
Pankaj sir is such a wholesome person❤️

Even tho saif ali khan would be my least favorite actor out of this lot, i still appreciate how he was so invested in the conversation

I loveeedddd Nawaz and Pankaj&#39;s friendshipplo

I saw new Saiffff. And I like himmm. And now I get to knoww why Bebo married him. Bebo being Geet and Saif being Saif. Kinda a perfect match. 🖤

Langda tyagi best done
Nawazuddin be like BC what's going on ???
The most fun, in-depth conversation I heard from one of the best actors in series and cinema💙♥️

Some great faces got chance to take  part in this round table🔥❤👏

This was too short!!!

It is amazing to watch these talented peoples together...

Had such a good good good time watching this 😁😁😁😁😁

Maja aa gaya... And rightly said Jaideep and Prateek

<a href="">38:10</a> I heard this from Shahruk's mouth..
Pratik Gandhi 💓
Thoroughly enjoyed it❤️❤️
One of the best roundtables and their affection for each other&#39;s performance stood out. Good Work ~

Practice😍
Now this what we actually needed a bollywood with fine actors ... Nor ananya nor Sara .. feels good 🙃😌

I m here for Pratik Gandhi
<a href="">31:38</a> saif reaction when pratik said about humanising the character 🤪 coz saif was trolled when he said that in his next movie he will humanize the ravan side

Rajeev you should have done two roundtables. One for movie n other for OTT, then you could have invited more actors like asur, panchayat actors, ludo n thappad actors n many more.

What a learning experience!

Best Roundtable Saif Raj Jaideep Kemmu Nawaz ❤️ and mirzapur guy
Brilliant 👏🏽 miss Ifran Khan ❤️
Saif enjoy this roundtable and Happy for Pratik Gandhi

Woow what an intellect . Great talks . Really loved it

Did u guys noticed divyendu wore the munna bhaiya&#39;s outfit.

For very first time I feel like we are changing towards new direction.  These all people deserve it. Jaideep and divyenndu and pankaj ji  are gem💎

Pratik Gandhi smile ❤️
Loved the whole talk. Much more than usual talk.Saif enjoyed the company most than anyone else,Glad to see many new people joining senior people on the talk

Nawazuddin is like : Ye bachche log theek thaak bol lete hain. 😂

No negative comments this roundtable is pure gold🏆 ❤❤❤ petition for round 2

Miss u Irrfan Sir ❤️👏👏
Loved Pratik&#39;s acting in &quot;Scam..&quot; series. Well done!

Saif ALi Khan is a huge star but such a decent and modest person

Pankaj ji said a little..is in interview..Love you Pankaj ji.❤
Pratikkk!!❤
Kunal khemu is UNDERRATED he did abhay 2 and malang this year. Although malang wasted him but Abhay both seasons was very good.

Roundtable is getting better every year.

Avinash Tiwary  should&#39;ve been here 😌

lovely... could have watched this for another hour...

Great content

I have watched this over and over again. Everyone is so fond of each other and the answers were full of honesty (felt like taking notes 😂). So light hearted and funny! Love all of them and cannot wait for the day when Bollywood will be ruled by nothing, but talent. Lots of love! ❤️

Saif is the only one with the camera lights on his face.

Prateek gandhi was brilliant...

This is too much🔥

Imagine a movie with all these actors in it. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banarjee, Shujoy Ghosh, or even Scorsese or Nolan 🤯

Saif is 50 years old and yet he’s so eager to learn from them and he was genuinely excited to be on this roundtable for the first time. What a sweetheart he is! I enjoyed this so much. Rajeev’s roundtables are as exciting as movies, they‘re just so interesting and fun to watch. And I have to say, this was much better than the actresses roundtable.

all the best actors in India..amazing stuff

Pankaj Tripathi 🖤
Can we see debate between leaders like this ? Instead of trolling or slaying each other , discuss each other&#39;s ideas and build the India together with diverse yet combined ideas .

This time around the participants seemed soo much at ease and involved in the conversation that the I just lost the track of time 👌

&quot;Reshmi baal h iske to&quot; Pankaj tripathi has its own innocence humour.

I loved pankaj tripathi he made me laugh 😂 interview

This was one of the best interviews I have ever watched, honestly i could watch them talk for 24 hours.

Am I Only Here For Munna Bhai?😉

Jalwa hai munna bhaiya 😊
<a href="">1:11:14</a> &quot;trance&quot; is the best movie 🔥🔥

Pankaj ji is such a simple humourous person....

<a href="">22:01</a> 😂😂

Pankaj tripathi- haan correct correct..
Liquid
Best roundtable ever. We did miss Irfaan. But someone from Panchayat should have been invited. Probably Raghuveer Yadav.

Jeeju and saale sahib together ( proud moment :P :) dey both were grt in their respective roles....

Only Likes and praises for this round of actors table

Pankaj sir..alag hi swag hai😊😊😊
Loved Saif and his eagerness to learn from others, despite being the most senior in the lot. Hats off!

I liked all of the. Wish them a best luck ... I really liked th role played by Kunal in go Goa gone..I mean that was really hilarious

Pratik is the only OP

Good to see real actor 😍

I like saif simplicity.he is not showing Khan tantrums.

Saif talks a lot. He is very genuine! All humble actors.

This is one the greatest conversations i have ever seen.... it wasn&#39;t even  an interview...just good actors sitting together and having a chat. I cannot stress enough how much we need more of this. To everyone on this frame... Thank you so much 🙏🏽👍🏾

I enjoyed this so much, I wish it was longer! What a charismatic and lovable roundtable this was

Perhaps one of the best roundtables;no stars, no egos, pure talent and discussion about craft👏👏

Any one of them is far better than those star kid combined

Where has Kunal Khemu been all this while, Man is he good with words?! His sensibility speaks for his craft as an actor (from Lootcase at least)

Just realised, Pankaj Tripathi is in the same room where he shot now memeing with slayy point for Netflix.

best roundtable
Who is here only for pratik gandhi

One of the best of roundtable.

Pankaj sir sound so funny and cute

Kaleen Bhaiya &amp; Gaitonde on Same Screen😊🤩🤗
Best roundtable episode of all time

Arjun Mathur should be here!

Thankyou to them

Great to see twins Divyendu and Kunal Kemmu together in the Roundtable.😁

Only here for pratik.. what a find!!

Incredible ..👍Loved it

2020 is actually boon for  real and authentic actors

Loved the way Saif side tracked himself decided to learn from these amazing bunch. As an audience he&#39;s d biggest star in this sitting lot bt he is there learning from this good actors, that recognition n humility is great. We hv seen Saif doing his worst acting to doing his best performance, n it&#39;s a good thing that he also admires n understand that these lot can teach me many things. You need humility to do that when you r one of the highest paid in the lot n still acknowledge that these guys know acting better than me..

Nawaz bhai is not visible, why are you wearing glasses?
Just came for pratik

Pratik Gandhi's timestamp please do?
4 of his actors, Kashyap must be proud right now

Rajeev bhai, I have gained respect for you after seeing this.
Reshmi is hairy🤣🤣🤣
Kunal- &quot;I see this screen and I&#39;m not star struck I&#39;m Talent-struck&quot; He summarised all of our feelings.. Hands down the best round table ever❤

I enjoyed this more than the offline version...... Loved it

One Pratik ❤️
This time Saif the actor... has talked to people.
My personal favorites in chronological order: 1. Pratik - Scam2. Jaideep - Paatallok3. Divyendu - Mirzapur 24. Nawaz - Serious Men5. RajKumar - Ludo6. Pankaj - Mirzapur 27. Kunal - Lootcase8. Saif: Tanhaji
2 Guys Are Relatives4 Guys From Gangs Of Wasseypur Only Two Guys Are Different Here 😎👍

Too much legends in this interview ❤️✌️

Pratik Gandhi!!
This Roundtable is amazing 😍😍😍 <a href="">1:14</a> ghanta nikla pata hi nahi chala Grounded actors 🤘🏻🤘🏻
I honestly jumped on Pratik&#39;s part ngl😁😁 Pratik go on❤️✌️✌️
Good to saif enjoying so much

Pankaj tripathi has such an interesting insight

saifu has taken empty stomach🤣
Saif is very sensible

I could listen to them all my life, sense maturity wisdom and experience.

So happy to see actors like Kunal finally getting the due credit. <a href="">#COVID19</a> has been an equalizer!

<a href="">

Everyone is great but saif and Nawaz are elite

munnaa bhaiyaa..pitaji ko pranam kar dete kam se kam
Pankaj ji is amazing yaar great person
Imagine all these actors together in one series

&quot;What about bh**di wale chacha?&quot; Saif is damn cute on this interview😂😂😂

What is Saif doing here.....this was round table for actors

Nawaz vaai = Baap of BollywoodPankaj sir = coolest actor of bollywood

<a href="">59:58</a> wtf saif🤣🤣🤣
AMAZING BUNCH OF ACTORS

Kaalin bhaiya, munna bhaiya  And Gaitonde are too funny😂😂🤣

Wow! All the Talented stars in one Video.

Pratik bhai, you seem more correct than me.
Saif has a fighting attitude and nature.

Pankaj Tripathi is intellectual in acting...

Enjoyed a lot....thanks

I really liked Saif humbleness.... not like the usual old actor&#39;s if his age... improvising, humour n taking notes... appreciate... 👍

wish to see them all together in some web series and only by a talented director, only that can justify their talents... a 2 hr movie can&#39;t justify each one.....

Real actors are here❤️

Deniro never died in taxi driver... Raj sir

Saif is enjoying 😍😍🤣

Rajkumar is so even deserving to sit with Srk and Amitabh Bachchan ❤️ so proud of him

I liked that you invited all the deserving people in this table

RR ♥️✌️
Glad to hear the conversation of all great Actors in round table.

Sir please speak some Hindi...
Like how saif admitted that he still needs to work on his acting a little bit.

Patal lok overrated

Somehow Rajkumar comes across as too arrogant and full of himself here

Even I was dumbstruck when I watched the death scene of Manoj Bajpai as a child...

Saif is so excited during the whole conversation

It is a really good productive conversation...getting to understand the actual art form

Munna bhaiya I also told this thing to my friends, that such a big empire was destroyed by me.
Thanks Rajeev, I really really enjoyed this, I didn&#39;t expect this type of get together with the lead actors can be seen.

Just love the video. Love all ❤😭

I wish Irrfan Khan sir was here.
Really if you want to act just learn or practice...

Its the best roundtable ensemble possible ....Saif - Privileged AF but he understands that so he sounds far more sensitive than other starkids , but comparatively he came off a little naive , he seems genuinely in awe of a child being amongest them , just hijacks Rajeev works and does a better work. Jaideep - Humble background  been there in the industry for so long , has a seasoned perspective and millions of personal story Divyenndu -  laconicalthough extrmely new comparative to others ... but witty AF and respects everyone in the pannel Pratik Gandhi - seems a little overwhelmed by the seniority around him , but he is very confident about his art and his breakthru show  Rajkumar - has had his stardom, but seems to have watched all of his contemporaries  work ...well prepared Pankaj Tripathi - the wisest man of the lot and knows a lot but happy to comply to all He is just being kaleen Bhaiya amd having the last say.Nawaz Sir -even after the being  successful and popular, respects his contemporaries and he is actually bored  of being in these pannels coz he had been in these so much Kunal khemu - He is happy to just have been called and shares some really good instances , he provides the view of someone who is new to the addition of A-list.

<a href="">57:21</a> Saif Ali Khan - I'm Not Afraid (Official Music Video) Saif Ali Khan - I'm Not Afraid (Official Music Video)
Seeing all of them togather ...i can see bollywood is going to Rock this upcoming years.

I wanna see saif as a alpha like Race and Race 2 , Phantom etc...why did he do movie like hamshakal and brainless movies.

I want saif to have his own talk show, he&#39;ll be a good host

This is the first video this long I&#39;ve watched without skipping

Finally a group of talent ❤️❤️❤️

I watched 4 time this interview

50% of this panel is a Gangs of Wassepur reunion!

Rajeev sir, isn&#39;t it time to break gender norms of Bollywood and have a gender neutral actors roundtable? You already have a gender neutral directors and writers roundtable.

Here for what&#39;s outside Saif&#39;s window :D

GOW people in the same row

Is it really only me who didn&#39;t skip the interview 🤔😀

The gist at @<a href="">23:58</a>

Scam 1992❤️
23.58 WOW

Oh my god  what a great actor is Pratik Gandhi  i hope great future is ahead of him

finally delighted to see deserving actors on round table

7 great actors and 2 hosts. You know what I mean.

Feels like teaching pointing their students in a class 😂

Divyendu was damn good. Looked so confident.

All superstars r on same vedio ❤️
Saif should start his own Chat Show. He would be a great host and I am sure will have some very intriguing conversations since he’s so curious and involved with everyone. ☺️

Resamibal hain 😁
Nobody: Pankaj Tripathi: Reshami Baal hai to iske!

Giving each other space and respect -- that shows the maturity of the actors.

Wow❤️.....🙏Saif is a gem of individuals.Full of courtesy and Manner.👍Pankaj sir bahut undaaa🙏

&quot;Reshmi baal hai iske tho&quot; - Pankaj sir

Divyendu is on potato internet

This Round Table was very true. Thank you
100% impressed by Pankaj Tripathi &amp; Nawazuddin Siddiqui talking about Sthayi/Sanchari Bhav and Bharata Muni&#39;s Natyashastra 😅😅 <a href="">22:57</a>

Reshmi baal hai iske to !! 😂😂

I was expecting Divyendu to break into expletives all of sudden but I think that was just me over expecting 😁

Lol...Saif hijacked this roundtable from rajeev

These r the ACTORs for me ......n just especially here for Pratik Gandhi 😍

First time i have watched roundatble with very excitement .

i think panchayat is far better than lootcase

This video in itself is a great short movie ... with such amazing actors 🔥

Watching just for Prateek &amp; Nawaz...

Bandits bandish is the best webseries in this year❤️❤️❤️❤️

I miss irfan khan😥💔
Sach bhai bhai ending acha nei tha mirjapur 2 ka
<a href="">31:00</a> best
Sab best of best hne

Patal lok op

this is the best roundtable ever, seriously rajeev you have upped your game

I guess Kunal and Saif are a room apart

Missing irfaan khan here..
Saif was also good in Laal kaptan

scam: 1992my favourite

I love this conversion so much

English vs Hindi ❤️❤️❤️
I was baffled to hear the term &quot;Natyashastra&quot; used by any Indian actor. It is the oldest treatises on the process of drama but some how I thought it only existed in the world of academicians and researchers now. It was a pleasant surprise. Thank you Pankaj Tripathi.

Saif with amazing Wit

It should be called talent table

Rajkumar Rao also buttering Saif at the end...weird...

Saif is just being a diplomat, winning brownie points from everyone...buttering...

Now it sounds like ACTORS roundtable. Pratik scam was the best for me amoung all.

One has to be a little foolish to laugh openly
No surprises. Nawaz immediately understood what Raj was saying. LOL hahaha

Apart from talking about Nawaz, Prateek, Pankaj, Kunal, Devyendu, I really liked Jaideep's talking bhai.
Pankaj Tripathi is so cute and authentic! He makes me love Hindi!

Pratik love from gujrati...  Go on.. It will take time

Kunal Khemu reminds me of James Franco😁

So enjoyable
Thank you for getting actors for this roundtable. Refreshing.

All legends in once scene

Pankaj&#39;s sir Hindi is like a fine wine 🙏

Can we all spam PANKAJ TRIPATHI &quot;OP&quot;.😗

Including Ranbir would&#39;ve made this just PERFECT!

So happy to see these actors where they should be, actor&#39;s roundtable

70% gangs of Wasseypur

Waaaw

Soo much talent in one frame💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Awesome 👍
Pratik acting with smile ....

Pankaj Sir 'Ras' Please read it.
Omg I love everyone! My fav actor ever this year! I love Pratik Gandhi!!!! Of course Nawazuddin, Divyendu, Pankaj and Saif Ali Khan!!!

It would be complete if Ranbir will be also present in this

Saif is the oldest guy on the panel but looks one of the youngest. Amazing!

I am only for Pratik Gandhi.

Trance ❤️❤️❤️
<a href="">1:00:46</a> Nawaz was going to say &quot;Mar na bhosdike&quot; then controlled himself somehow

❤️❤️❤️❤️Amazing❤️❤️❤️❤️
The best ever. Thank you rajeev

<a href="">57:05</a> Bhosidi wale Uncle LOL😂
This is the best Rountable so far.No sophisticated plot, all real and deserving people.Saif ki jagah Jeetu Bhaiya ho sakta tha 😁

Pankaj Tripati is the bored uncle in the family gathering who just wants to eat and get through the whole thing with little to no participation.

Pankaj sir sacred games Mirzapur gangs off wasepur ludo also 😎

Pankaj Tripathi is just awesome..love this guySaif is a like a curious child ..he is so pure ...he is that child who is eager to learn

Please tell our Harshad Mehta also brother😒
Pratik we are very proud of you ❤️ <a href="">#proudgujjus</a>

Amazing episode

<a href="">1:12</a> Reshmi baal h iske toh Reshmi baal Pankaj Tripathi so cute ???
Where is Jitendra Kumar aka Jeetu Bhaiya from Panchayat?

<a href="">24:57</a> ❤️
Gandhi is great man

These Actors are carrying forward the Legacy of Dilip Kumar, Raaj Kumar, Ashok Kumar, Dev Anand, Sunil Dutt, Motilal,Balraj Sahni, Om Prakash, Naseeruddin Shah, Farooq Shaikh,Om Puri, Amrish Puri.

Rajiv sir i always wait for this gem ....All were awesome.

Thoroughly enjoyed these actors on actors round table ... well deserved all of them .. Kunal was most underrated actor... his comic timing is great and infact I saw his moon walk dance moves on some dance show .. it was jaw dropping

Its awesome to see Pratik Gandhi here

This is the best roundtable so far.... Enjoyed it thoroughly. Saif was both sincere and hilarious

We also need to see Ranvir Shorey&#39;s perpsective on these ideas and opinions. He&#39;s also a class actor.

Nawaz was the only actor who was wired in.

I wish shahrukh iss conversation m hone chahie the..

<a href="">22:37</a> Guruji aa gaye 😂😂😂😂
Jaipeep the best

This frame set is the future of film industry....I loved the roundtable so much to know about acting .....

Sare  ke sare Hero...... Pratik ke agggy hai Zero.......👍

Pratik work was good and the scam script credit goes

5 ki pepsi Munna bhaiya sexy
Such a wonderful conference

Divyendu bhaii is on top 😍🔥🔥

Feel very proud for Pratik.And can see the happyness in Pratik&#39;s and Jaydeep&#39;s eye that after long time they get appreciation from the genuine actors which they deserved.

one of the best round table discussion....

I want jaideep to speak. Share his opinions.

<a href="">#TheDirectorsRoundtable</a> You guys missed out <a href="">#BandishBandit</a>, in both the Director&#39;s roundtable and Actor&#39;s roundtable. There was some extraordinary work seen in that show. Amazing concept and brilliantly put together. Not to forget Abhishek Bachchan in Breathe

54.45 where Pankaj ji says &quot;If Rajeev ji starts the work then he will go..&quot; and 1.01.40 &quot;After that Ramu started doing a lot of drama&quot; got me in splits🤣
Pratik was Fanboying 😂😂

This is so pleasing to the eyes. So enjoyable. Laughed thoroughly. Great choice of selection for the actors  roundtable for this year. Couldn&#39;t have been better than this ❤️

Divyendu be like: This is how it is, this is what is being said before dying. Divyendu may not have given it as a sensible man, but this character has given a 1 minute speech before dying. This is how it is.
<a href="">43:42</a> pure gem jaydeep..
Jaideeo Ahlawat won best actor...some credibility restored to Indian awards

What a panel !

All legends in one screen...love u all....

57.05hahahahahha bhosde wale uncle
PANKAJ SIR has the most calmest Voice 😊❤️

Kunal is such a smart and funny dude. Totally undervalued Bollywood!

Everybody-nawaj is bestMe-pankaj is best

Saif is a curious guy he is so classy

Prateek 😍🥳
Really enjoyed it. Thanks Rajiv

This year Pratik was the best🙏

Proud of Saif for bluntly stating that if you are privileged and not affected then the pandemic does not have much impact on you.

Loved it al the way... ❤️

Jaideep Ahlawat is Mr cool 😎

This has got to be the best roundtable discussion ever. Saif enjoyed it thoroughly. The chemistry between Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Pankaj Tripathi is so evident. And the mutual respect amongst each other.  Wish Indian awards appreciated these gems much more.

What the fuck is wrong with people..saif is actually a very talented actor..just becoz he has been a mainstream star for decades doesn&#39;t make him any less than others..his work in omkara, dil chahta hai , tanhaaji and many more is outstanding...and moreover he still at his age wants to learn and grow..!

Saif is so natural loving him more <a href="">#respect</a>

It's official, baal hai iske, it's official anyway😂😂😂
Saif very loyal love this Dibyendu also

Watching only for Pratik Gandhi ❤️

Scam,,, Patal lok,, Mirzapur,,, Criminal Justice,,,, Ludo .....lootcase.. Tanhaji... Serous Men,,,,
Best round table till date
That scene was taken out in Dhupal...absolutely true.
Pankaj Tripathi and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are the most knowledgeable regarding acting.

Wow! Kunal Khemu is so sorted! I&#39;m very interested to see what he&#39;ll do next! He is hot too!

real actors discussing on the basics of their profession . Dialogue delivery remembering lines as it is as written is tough and till the time I haven&#39;t heard on this basic issue of acting carrier ❤️ . This interview must have to watch for those who want to be in this profession

Kunal Khemu was super funny in lootcase...🤗

What did Nawazuddin say? Controlling your personal emotions while acting is right and difficult as per the character.
1st raw: Bollywood .....2nd raw: Professors of Actors 3rd raw: Toppers of acting class

Prateik Gandhi really knows his craft like Pankaj Tripathi 👍

Want to see Nawaz sir and Pratik in one frame

Wonderful panel of such humongous talent … good choice 👍

Such a great conversation to hear. Thanks!

Who is only here for Pankaj Gandhi Like here👇

Everybody is feeling like Sunkar.
Prateek also acted well in dying scene of scam 1992

We have a-1)father son duo2)grandfather grandson duo3)brother in laws

So nice to see the grandfather grandson duo in this roundtable. If you know you know. Also sultan is also there

Like divyendu said Munna&#39;s death scene wasn&#39;t quite authentic like the way he killed compounder.

Faizal KhanShamsad AlamSultan QureshiAnd Shahid KhanPoora Wasseypur are here👍👍👍
8 legends in one frameAncient video.....
Mujhe lga Munna Bhaiya &quot;Bsdkkk&quot; se apna suruat krenge 😂😂

Pratik Gandhi seems nervous here.... idk why

Man!!! This episode itself is an acting lesson.

This was the best roundtable in last few years. Loved it.

Wow!

Wowww

love Pratik being labelled A-List star ...
I know this much is true

Talking about writers and improvising lines is how Joey got Killed on Days of our lives ...hahahaRajiv should do a round table with writers post this

so enjoyable to watch

I can&#39;t believe I put this off for a week. This was amazing, insightful yet humourous.

In the beginning he said that Pankaj ji ne wah..
Roundtable se square table ho gya

jaideep sir bhaaaad came in 1995 in haryana
Dear Rajeev,I very much enjoyed this discussion. Please conduct such sessions regularly.Thanks

Which app it is zoom or any other

Rajeev best show ever . Enjoyed more then  tv show . Good job .

Pankaj Sir is fun to talk.

Most sensible roundtable.... Saif just get along with any age group

The only bad thing about this video is that, it ends..😢

I feel I am there with them Yaar itne ache log hein sab k sab ...off the screen v dikh jata hai ❤️

Nawaz glasses be like: ya tou pehenle ya tou utaarde
Liking it only because these actors deserve it..

Pankaj Tripathi has only watched 2films during the pandemic, that too malyalam. One he named is Trance (FF&#39;s brilliance).. felt so happy after hearing it, one of the best films I&#39;ve recently watched.

<a href="">1:01:35</a>

Gangs of Wasseypur team reunites together for the first time : Sultan, Shamshad, Faizal and Shahid Khan 😄

Very nice 👍
Who thinks Saif was little too active!! 😂

I didnt wanted this roundtable to end man.. like how amazing it is.. and have to say, saif made it more worth watching, the way he gives importance to what all others say.. damn what a roundtable❤️

Nawaj sir k chashme ko kya hua ... Any idea anybody????

The best actors in one frame🤟

Now this is real roundtable... 🤏

I just watched pratik Gandhi

This round table Deserve more Views

The best round table till date

Such a pleasent round table talk it was 🥺🥺☺️☺️❣️❣️
jaideep and pratik stole the show this year..and saif stole this roundtable 😊

Rajeev seeing saif taking over his job is funny 🤪

Pankaj Tripathi is the most humble guy. Love you sir....

Neeta…what have you done to me?
Reshmi baal h is to
Kahan tha re Petikar😀😀

Great talented people in the show .

Too much talent

Partik, Rajkumar, Pankaj Tripathi, Nwazudin ji and Jaideep ji...... But I am grounded.
It feels so wholesome &amp; enriching to see all these talented bunch of actors in one frame.

<a href="">47:04</a> illuminati is confirmed on saif&#39;s hand

Proud movement for pratik gandhi🤩🤩🤩
Nice people
It&#39;s great that such a epic scene was improvised by divyendu himself

This is what an Actor&#39;s Roundtable should be. Had an amazing time watching it. Looking forward for more such Roundtables.

every year I look forward to these roundtables and every year I&#39;m amazed!!!Thank you for bringing them all together and thanks to all the actors for being so REAL? I guess

Kunal khemu was not even invited, for the online session of the announcing of Disney+hotstar exclusive movies, in which his movie was even included and today he is at the a list tables😂😂 respect for the man

Good to see the real Bollywood !!

What is this discovered cooking, Munna bhaiyya? Cooking has been discovered by early man, you can say he learned cooking.
Only jaideep alhawat 🔥

Pankaj jee sirf maze le rahe hai...

The best of all roundtables! Fun watching it.

Bhaai, why don't you see when 1 hour went by and I didn't see it? Damn interesting ❣️
Most diverse n deserving panel as of today

Came here to listen to pratik Gandhi.. Man he is such a personality who keeps you glued to him.

Saif is the only Khan that aged like a fine wine in acting.

Saif is taking full advantage of his longevity in the industry, controlling the roundtable

Jaideep ahlawat💪💪💪.
Saif: &quot; Bhosdiwale uncle&quot;
Kunal.....how cute.....happy for u:)

Whattt... It&#39;s over???😨🙄🤔Seems like these great minds have so much more to talk about..Loved every expression of everyone, including Rajeev who provided them enough space for a heartwarming discussion🤘🏻💗

I didn&#39;t like when Nawaz says jese Pankaj bol rha tha, Even Saif called him Pankaj Ji Everytime

This interview was worth watching

Mosf of my favourite actors in this frame. Loved it. ❤

Pankaj Tripathis each words are praiseworthy and valuable ❣️

Awww wow all my favs in one frame!!!!! 💕

Please have another hour of this conversation with the same stars. Pratik Gandhi, Divyendu Sharma and Jaideep definitely had the best performances this year, but what was super cool about this episode was Saif Ali Khan brilliant presence and was intrigued at so many levels of how wonderfully these actors address their form of art. Please one more hour of the same group, would really help end 2020 well

One of the best show and episode, watched complete episode without any skip, lots of claps for these actors

A MUST ADMIT AND DEFINITELY TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO WATCH THIS ROUND TABLE....ITS JUST AMAZING 😊

When you realise that 50% A list actors of this roundtable was in gangs of wasseypur. India&#39;s best movie for a reason 🤘🏻

Munna Bhaiya❤❤❤
IDK why but i am feeling bad for divyendu 😔😔

The best roundtable of the decade! Loved it👏

best actors round table so far...

High 🙏👍👍👍
Best roundtable till date...👍🏼
Whole actors are real  actor.. No one is fake

The point Divyendu mentioned was legit, waiting 2 years for Mirzapur S2 and the makers kinda rushed Munna&#39;s death. We expected more from it. S2 was all good but i feel the last episode was kind of a mess. Guddu worked so much to take revenge and Munna just died of a gunshot within some seconds.

Pankaj sir always throws some deep shit knowledge!! What a Man!!!! GEM!

Talent in one frame

Saif ali khan was literally taking notes from every other actor in the entire interview...good to see that he was actually trying to learn a lot and admiring the other actors even after being a senior actor and great performer himself. It is really appreciable

I just watched this video for pratik ganghi

Real talented people on table and best actor of the year jaideep alawat omg

Kunal,Rajeev,saif,pratik are sitting in library 😂😂

This was by far the best actors lineup!

Surprised to watch the patience level of munna bhaiya

munna bhaiya alwayz look like munna bhaiyaa!! 😂😂😂 no matter wherever he was!

I think you should permanently flush the conventional format of roundtable down the drain. The flashy lights and exquisite table décor don&#39;t matter when you have this casual, fun chat brewing among some of the best actors this year.

Munna Vaiya is not dead 💀⚰
Rajeev Masand was like the guy holding the starter pistol at the start of the race. He fired and then it was all on autopilot. Great minds coming together with no inhibitions and that is what you get...just equals exchanging ideas and anecdotes.

Missed Irfan bhai greatly in this roundtable! A void never to be filled.

Felt sad when this ended. Such a good discussion. Thankfully no stupid people were invited in the name of actors.

Missed Irfan Khan.

Saif&#39;s laughter in DCH was one of the most artificial scenes in that movie. He just proved Rajkumar Rao&#39;s and Pankaj Sir&#39;s point.

Nawazuddin &lt;3
Saif is drunk.
I would say, Proud moment for Saif ali khan to sit with these highly talented people ...cz no one from bolly kids are there ... kudos  to saif sir. Big fan by the way 🥂

Pankaj, Saif and Raj has my heart❤

I can go on watching this and never get bored❤

Who is missing piyush mishra.

Was very interesting to watch this,Vinay Pathak in Chintu ka Birthday was also brilliant and deserved a spot here,I think

Why is actors round table only entitled to hindi cinema and not to any other language of cinema in our country. I don&#39;t  mean to demean the actors who are called upon because all of them are pretty good but I think the content creators all across the country is coming up with good cinema.

Best panel of all times

The amount of talent in this roundtable is unmatchable 💯 feel so good that finally we are appreciating great performances and content ❤

Real actor&#39;s.. love from Pakistan ❤️

What exactly Nawazuddin said @ <a href="">1:00:44</a> ..... &quot;marne se pahle hero...puri <i>______</i> bol ke jata tha&quot;?

Please have English subtitles added.  Missing out on the two I was most eager to hear from

They all my actual hero&#39;s real actors

Loved it!!!

saif enjoy very much this Roundtable

This is soooo goood

Mehta na raaj ma . Market maja ma
It was really nice to watch all this great talents in 1 screen. Very well done @rajeevmasand for bringing this up. But also wished to see Amit Sait here who is another deserving talent.

Saif is a good listener thats great in a conversation

Really enjoyed their conversation ❤️

What an amazing amazing roundtable. Saif, Kunal really are witty and so down to earth.

whore uncle super
Most adorable interview ever!!! The humility of these amazingly talented actors is truly unparalleled

Saif Ali Khan is so attentive at the moment, just loved how he&#39;s learning and asking questions from each individual. No pride of being a senior. Fabulous!

Pure talent 🔥
Best round table ever mr480pguy

Father son in one frame Munna bhaiya, Kalin bhaiya
This is premium content bro

No doubt this is the the best round table till now in Rajiv Masand. All are great actors and very intellectual.♥️

ACTORS are on panel🎉

Rajkumaar bro killed itk
Why are you eating this?
4 out of 8 were in the Gangs of Wasseypur. Makes me remind that how amazing the casting of that film  was.

Wow , all deserve to be here

I enjoyed it! Good callers 👍
Pankaj Tripathi in end of the conversation reshmi baal hai iske reshmi baal 😂🤣

Pankaj Tripathi is the cutest guy in all of Indian cinema.. everyone is having so much fun.. it&#39;s absolutely lovely to watch such great actors at a roundtable 🙏

Saif is really humble respect!

Real Actors of Bollywood in 1 frame.. woow 😍🤩

Nawaz sir is holding spects like Faisal Khan.

To look at this theature talent after the passing over of Farooque Shaikh, Amrish Puri, OM Puri.. The gathering is heart warming

Saif should have discussed about LALKAPTAAN
