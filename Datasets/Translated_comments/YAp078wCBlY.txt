Deepika ,where was your camera?

SHES GORGEOUS

180 degree
for 30 secs, i was wondering about how bad her cameraman was

Deepika should be boycotted by the media and by the public.... I don&#39;t know after knowing about her still people are admiring and missing her... Don&#39;t give value to her appearance, need to know about her personality and thinking process... Everything fake.... Acts in movies and in real life.... Atleast people perspective need to change admire people who do service to the society and boycott who harm the society. 

 but

Why the video pic is moving strange

What type of leggings is this in <a href="">1:25</a>?

Love you ️️
My favourite heroen Dipika . And Dipika soooo beautiful

Because of what they did to me I&#39;m going to spend the rest of my life in a constant never ending state of hatred. I will never have a chance to live a decent life. I&#39;m already 100 percent disabled and likely wont be alive another week.

Please put your day in my life

I am your big fan

We were to dumb too dumb to understand the 180 degrees title. xD

The video is very bad

We don&#39;t want to see tainted celebrity in any shows. Neither we want to hear anything about her.

How!️

What is wealth?
Who is here after the drugs case.....maal 

Hey stop who is here after her drugs situation hit like

See the change in the first when she welcomed us she was wearing a green  sandals and the when she was showing us her suitcase in her room she was wearing a pair of shoes and sorry to say but I hate the 160 degree tour it was better if it was shot as a normal regular video  

I thought Deepika was dancing............I mistakenly clicked this video lol <a href="">#SushantFan</a> <a href="">#ssrians</a>

Ookkk that&#39;s why u take drugs...  Shame shame madam

Hehe.. people complaining about cameraman!! You are that cameraman here  use fingers!!

Meri deepi
What a beauty, deep

You are really good actor, I mean in real life. I can clearly tell that she has many faces to show that she is innocent but inside heart full of dark ghost and sewage:))

she is sooo cute!

love you Deepu

Charsi puff low
Madam, do not keep drugs, what is it?
<a href="">

who is this
Description of drugs has been missed...fucker
She forgot to pack her &quot;maal&quot; in that suitcase.

<a href=""> Listen to my channel and ring the bell 
How about drugs...

Did you pack your MAAL
Keep your maal as well you need that

Enough of packing your luggage for trip, it&#39;s time you rest in jail that has no bail. Marriage has come full circle in your life after all the depression dramas you made up 

And where do you put the drugs.?

Never ever expected Deep..that you were intentionally involved in those stuff that is Criminal Offence..You were my Icon!

Why Didn&#39;t she show the &#39;maal&#39;?Bloodydruggies<a href="">#boycottbollywood</a>

The realty there are people lifting packing her bag. See how much the PR are working to create an image of her. Young girls look at this and get influenced . She looks senseless and brainless just as the way she is behaving. Remember this is not a teen making video . Please please let not money  speak let truth win. I am so happy that God is exposing these fools

I also have maal in my suitcase!!!

And also one pudiya of ganja

I didn&#39;t expect you to take hashish or weed whatever the drug you consumed‍️

Drugies lady

flag marker
You don’t need that in the jail 

Depressed druggist Deepika . Maal hai Kya?  Where is drugs? Shame Deepika

I kinda love this 180° thing 

Abhi will run against the traitor because his father NCB will kill him.
STUPID

Sb unlike kro

See his office also..not in the residential area..shameless army.
her house omg

<a href="">#Peepukideepu</a>
jb nhi tha inke paas............tb kha thi.....paisa mila tb itna uchaal rhi h
Wow that was cool  she is soooooooooooo pretty

Her house should be scanned to for Drugs   NCB should do it <a href="">#NCB</a> <a href="">#justiceforSSR</a> <a href="">#boycottbollywooddrugmafia</a>

Please stop this... I like Deepie the most.... this is the worst shot I ve ever seen... adjust your camera for god sake  man...‍️ super irritating

It&#39;s more like brand promotion video 

This gave me a headache!

Why the screen is moving

Watch only because of deepu

Really hate Deepika Padukone....where is she now.... depression theory ki Malkin.... Boycott these stars.... They are not meant to be... I was a big fan of her but not now...

Yes depression is real 

Her suitcase is literally my whole wardrobe. LMAO

Pagal

The leggings look like she is unwrapping a huge plastic bag

Hey guys! Support a small youtube singer here. Thanks.

Fake person

Omg  it was so annoying By the way I am using iPad  it’s so irritating

Hi

Very  nice.

Stop this nonsense ok Tum logon ka asli chehra samne agaya hai<a href="">#boycottbollywood</a><a href="">#CBIEnquiryForSushant</a>

An eye opening article. Must read it about Sushant <a href="">

My favorite deepika ️
This seems 180° to me. And not 360....

my baby deepu
These are how many clothes I have in my entire wardrobe.. 

i love you dp u look good love u
The picture quality is so interesting

Never seen such a video 

How do they film this??

Move your phone around guysP.S: Keeping it horizontal helps

It&#39;s so lovely the way both of them talk about each other saying &quot;my husband and my wife&quot;

love you deepveer
Wow.. I loved it.. But how can this happen... 

Why everyone is saying that it&#39;s annoying I mean it&#39;s fun

Darling I love your husband sooooooooooooooo much

I scrolled my screen and I was like where did I scroll her away

Hi deepika mail me pls
this is all fake.. she never wears all that... it&#39;s a promotional video!

Ma'am felt very good
<a href="">

OMG
From Arabic here
I was trying to zoom in

What did she just say, Scaidule? :/

Who is shooting all ulta seedha

I got scared when i opened the video thought what happened to my mobile...

She is very beautiful and I really like her.

<a href="">

I would kill that camera men.

Deepika even if you wear rags you will look beautiful so shut up

I love her skirt  someone know where to get that or the similar one?

I love you    
I was adjusting my mobile settings if my brightness is good if youtube settings is good just to see what&#39;S wrong that with that so when I put my finger into the screen then I realise how annoying that and it play not too clearly

Most annoying video everrr

She’s memorised the script her PR team gave her  and speaking like ratta

360 is cool but 180 just dumb lol

she is self made love her

For the first 30 sec I  was wondering did I just accidentally click on the auto rotate 

OMG..this 180 thing is very irritating

Nice 
I luv u baby
This 180° is like peek a boo. I have to move my screen to where she is moving.

U r showing ur clothes Not how u pack.Stupid

She seem to be a good friend of pappu

She earns money by making people fool and goes in foreign for enjoying instead of helping people in india

I was facing the floor and was thinking wtf why are they filming her shoes the whole time and then realized when I came into the comments section 

Dammm cutooo
Wow amazing! At start I thought that video itself is shot in that frame.. only after a minute I realized that I&#39;m the cameraman here

Deepika Padukone is a member of Tukde Tukde gang.
Is that her house?

Who is excited for Cannes 2020?

Deepika&#39;s travel suitcase is practically half a wardrobe lolll

wow......... I thought I am the photographer

I dont like the Girl ....she seems dumb

Guys Its a 180 degree video which you can use your fingers to navigate and watch it well

Deepika and Ranveer are so wonderful in lovvve.. I love ittt

To all the people, who did nt understand the comments section: The comments refer to mobile device experience. Not PC :)

Wow technology am I right

I really find them blind who says that she&#39;s ugly...I mean excuse me if she&#39;s ugly then I don&#39;t know what you are  you must be trash becoz she&#39;s absolutely gorgeous

I really find them blind who says that she&#39;s ugly...I mean excuse me if she&#39;s ugly then I don&#39;t know what you are  you must be trash becoz she&#39;s absolutely gorgeous

Has the camera man seen the video after making it....he has to!

Is the camera guy sleeping here?

Is it a sponsored video by the brands mentioned by Deepika? 

Don’t use 180 thing
