I guess baby now?

I&#39;ve re-read my comment a million times

I was happy to see your son be born and worried about everything along with you, it get easier.

I told her I left a comment and made a bet with her that you&#39;d include it and we cheered

I left a comment on my son&#39;s mother&#39;s phone. We&#39;re split up now I was 19 at the time. I come to this video every year around Christmas just to be reminded of what was and when we smiled together. I&#39;m drunk now alone and haven&#39;t seen my son in months......there&#39;s a bigger story around all of this but it&#39;s comfort food for the soul I think.

funny this is popping up now after u had baby

Baaby here!

Malaysians and Singaporeans are on suicide watch

Hey PewDiePie have you ever watched Demon Slayer and tried out the game version of it

This man is so consistent with himself lately and it shows in his lastest QnA. It&#39;s so nice to see.

I&#39;m kinda curious. do you actually visit Sweden/family in Sweden Anymore? I guess you&#39;re pretty quiet about it when you do. But I feel like I should&#39;ve heard about it by now. I travel between Gävle-Stockholm-Gothenburg a lot. I live in Gävle and most of my relatives in Gothenburg, but I never really hear about you or really see you.

Well felix.. you have found the better balance

I never comment, but I have been watching yours and Marzia’s videos since the very beginning. My favorite uploads were always Friday with Pewdiepie. You never disappoint! I miss Marzia’s sweet voice and gentle personality by the way! You made such a difference on YouTube. Watching your videos gave me a dream to jump out of my comfort zone and create gaming content. One day I hope to fulfill that dream❤️ Thanks for being a long time creator and being there to distract your YouTube family from their everyday life stuffs. We love you!

&quot;Where do you see Youtube in 2 years?&quot;Youtube in 2 years: remove the dislike button

I have ADHD i don’t think i’ll remember “is math related to science?” 😭 AHHHHHHH

Remember when ANYONE used to use your videos to advertise their OWN channels?

I&#39;ve been watching your videos since I was about 13 I&#39;m 23 now with a one year now time really flys

Oddly specific with the Malaysian and Singaporean reactions haha, though ironically im happy as a Malaysian that u still remember this SEA country that u last visited a longgggg period ago.

:skull:

Big phone go brrr

<a href="">16:38</a> is my favorite question and answer. Will definitely keep that in mind

i am from Singapore &amp; I want to apologise on behalf of my country as I am extremely ashamed with their behaviours

i wonder if he was dealing with the fear of death/overthinking of consciousness during the hard times he was describing.

<a href="">14:46</a> this question aged questionably accurately

Ok

<a href="">0:01</a> We love qna with PewDiePie

Let’s just hope Raid Shadow doesn’t come for Felix

I think ppl are scared that you will quit… that’s why they ask.

<a href="">3:20</a> go home😂
pewdi should open a podcast

<a href="">15:20</a>

Given googles difficult hustory with shady market practice: Did you get slandered by your competitions marketing team? Did they plant articles about that swear word you did live? Obviously you cannot answer that. So my question is this: wwyd if you had proof of this?

&quot;I don&#39;t like networking. I think it is dishonest, and try-hardy and gross in general&quot;Easy to say when you have fuck-you-money

How interested i felt when i watched oldest video and newest video ( i just found this channel 2 days ago)! He’s still HIMSELF…but we see more clearly.

its official we have pewdiepie for 30 more years!!!!

Anyone else hear socks instead of stocks (<a href="">4:00</a>)❔He now has companies invested in socks 🤣<a href="">18:28</a> - Amnesia OR Minecraft<a href="">11:31</a> - Horror Games<a href="">18:52</a> - Old Voice<a href="">19:29</a> - Beginner Videos<a href="">6:32</a> - Finding Brands<a href="">4:45</a> - Founding A Network<a href="">8:49</a>, <a href="">6:07</a>, <a href="">1:18</a> - Future Goals<a href="">16:04</a> - Music Passion<a href="">16:28</a>, <a href="">2:41</a> - Procrastinating Work?<a href="">16:55</a> - Honesty<a href="">8:17</a> - Dealing With Channel Hardships<a href="">7:40</a> - Relationship Reality<a href="">13:12</a>, <a href="">14:16</a>, <a href="">17:54</a> - Meeting FelixThank you for the video, Felix<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/dv90XtfhAurw8gTgzar4DA"></a>

Is it weird that I eat/drink comfort food when watching Pewds? (Like eggnog)

Mans wants to live in Japan so bad

Baby when?

just noticed that he answered the same question at <a href="">9:49</a> and <a href="">17:35</a>

When you watch old Pewds videos, but then you realize, you also watched when it was first posted.

<a href="">4:35</a> i kind of understand what you&#39;re saying here but money also becomes really important when you don&#39;t have it i definitely don&#39;t think money is the key to happiness and i definitely know i would relate to what you&#39;re saying if i was in fact really financially stable, but i also don&#39;t think money isn&#39;t important , because if it&#39;s standing in the way of you wanting to fulfill your wishes in life then it kind of takes the top spot(or at least a very high spot) in the list, so you kind of need to check it off of that list in order to give yourself the want you want, i.e. be happier.

Those people that took your picture or wants to take a picture with might be your  fans. Your fans that subscribe  to you, that buy your merch,  that watches your videos, that support you till where  you are now.  Stop being a special snowflake.

i heard that the samsung fold just came out but pewds had it 2 years ago ...

I guess he is one of the most down to earth content creator on this platform 💎

him: who cares about my money the robber next door: now i feel sad that I have to do this

<a href="">18:02</a>

Yo I clicked because of the title. This better not clickbait me

Ah yes, the revelmode...

I remember watching Felix as a child. And now I see my 13 year old brother watching him. He really has grown up with us ❤️

I love how honest you are

Is math related to science…yess …yess

If I ever meet you I’m gonna be way too nervous to remember “is math related to science”

I’ve been here since “BARREL” and I’m still here now. I think your genuinely a good person who sets respectful boundaries which is so refreshing compared to a lot of other people.

Lol on the part where Malaysia and Singapore is being noisy srceamish and stuff... cause that&#39;s what i would do and i from malaysia

pwediepie2019:  i don&#39;t need a big companypewdiepie 2020: mmmmm gfuel

<a href="">6:08</a> that did not age well

<a href="">7:10</a> is what you&#39;re looking for

What language do you think in? Also, what language do you usually set your personal devices to?

When you realize one of his worst performing videos has 3m views 😲

Will you ever visit Bangladesh?
Maby they can’t have kids…

<a href="">16:48</a>That&#39;s a good way to avoid disappointment tbh.😂😂😂

<a href="">4:42</a>That&#39;s exactly it. You don&#39;t know what to do with it.

<a href="">2:30</a>I guess it&#39;s both. It is holding you back to a certain extent but your videos are a huge source of entertainment. I guess the best answer in your case would be to keep up your videos and explore other things that you love and explore your potential.

I wish I lived in the UK

Good videos, thanks for contributions, you will be obviously missed ... 💞(I had written this message longer)Didn&#39;t Marzia already have a baby girl with you and you sure? Futures are often twice Best regards,-Aeon.

Poor Markiplier
Felix: &quot;it is bigger&quot;Marzia(giggling in the corner): no it&#39;s not.

Ik this has nothing to do with the vid but his hair looked good

I feel like Jake Paul could learn a thing or two from Pewds. J. Paul&#39;s always chasing the money using the most ridiculous tactics and paying the price with his mental health, while Pewds is pursuing his happiness rather than his greed.

U understand life👽

Here after marzia is really pregnent

THIS VIDEO WAS MADE ON MY BIRTHDAY….
Me if I randomly saw pewds.My brain: should I walk up to him? Probably not. But me wants to, I guess I will.What I would actually do...Me walking by him and whispering: PeWdIePiE.

From what we learned from his collabs with Ken, I think there won&#39;t be any babies anytime soon xD

2 days later, all hell broke lose in the form of COVID

I see so many Indian bros sending in questions. Nice
People pressuring pewdiepie into marriage and having kids is f@**ed

Money = Freedom

&quot;i dont like having things around me&quot;

yoooo, i saw this in my reckomended and brings memories of when his camera was bad

the way his face literally lights up mentioning abt japan

<a href="">18:00</a> is when the question is asked in cover picture

Why don&#39;t you have babies yet :&quot;)

sry dude!

As a Bro since Happy Wheels, if I were given the opportunity to ask for a picture, I would but yes, respect comes first.STILL, IS MATH RELATED TO SCIENCE

hey

wholesome

why am i watching this in 2021

I think you’re super cool and it would be real neat to meet you! 😎

Do celebs not get noticed in japan? Is it because of their culture around respect and so on?

No more racist comment Felix Best Man

nice vid

WTF is this phone?

Pyudipai is Belarusian
<a href="">0:00</a> I was SHOOKT!!! ^_^

18; 02

Make BEBE

<a href="">13:27</a> i bet if i see him and say that he&#39;ll be wtf!?

This is relaxing and enlightening.

hi

With Malaysia. Why are you crazy oiiii not True Bros kaaa aiyaaaa
Please don’t stop any time soon

If PewDiePie quits YouTube I am done with YouTube

If you have a peace about not having children, then don&#39;t have them. You&#39;ll probably find more favor from God in your life if you don&#39;t follow the crowd.

I don&#39;t know if this question is dumb, but why doesn&#39;t he get recognized in Japan?

journalism lives on in reputable newspapers. times, journal, post. all good. the impression that they&#39;re especially biased one way or another comes from people who don&#39;t read them and don&#39;t know what an editorial page is. this is partly down to television not making the distinction between the paper and it&#39;s editorials.

felix: fuphuvuhuvjn fhvhipargaa iu uhariuh jaiuhgiua uh iaurhghiuauhergiou;ah cargo oar grg oa uiuaiuha eiu iuaavhalivh ahva v arlriuhv aiufvg ui efif lFi .
I love how you answered all the questions, Pewds!

I was wondering if there would be a last day he would make videos not because I want him to quit at all, but it&#39;s kinda funny picturing a 65 year old live streaming minecraft and reacting to memes. I imagine Pewds will evolve over time and try new things. Maybe a podcast?

He cant be more wholesome<b>sobbing</b>

Still no baby

I think he thinks nieve means cliche

Great!

Wat one year?

he stays being woke

<a href="">0:07</a> he is using Samsung galaxy fold he revealed that he is using Samsung galaxy fold phone by showing it to camera ha ha😂😂🤣

Jack and Ken!That&#39;s actually really sweet

What tablet does pewds use

Does pewdiepie have instagram?

&quot;Baby When&quot; surprisingly scares me

the wisdome he posses so big

WW2 WW3 WW1

Can I have some money

What is his accent?

Money is liberty man, I understand what you wanted to say

I hope My videos hasn&#39;t Discover yet

F

Castro Alves
<a href="">13:46</a> i’m still feel sorry on behalf of Malaysians.. some of them are so rude that they tried to stalk and follow them where Felix and Marcia went ://

We know pewds either can&#39;t get da pusi or he get pusi so much that marzia won&#39;t get pregnant

&quot;Do any one know that&quot; - PewDiePie

I just listened to the Jenna Julien podcast talking about the wall street journal and you

But people be sleeping on my channel and YouTube decided to demonitize for no reason lol

same

Everytime pewdiepie talks about money I feel that lagom energy

We&#39;re sorry from Malaysia! 🇲🇾

&quot; money is not the most important thing &quot; you can said that when you know you can win more then 10K per months

Love how I&#39;m 19 and he pointed at the camera and said you&#39;re a normal 19 year old.

No offense, that haircut reminds me of DanTDM YEARS ago

baby when ?

baby wen
I love how your accent changes.

The 20yr question should be &quot;where do you see yourself in 20yrs, meaning where do want to be?&quot; Kids, houses, where you want to live, what you want to learn as in instruments, martial arts, even how to do irrigation work or being a mechanic.

Damn he is so cute

I think I&#39;ve accidentally watched this video 4 times.

Awesome

It’s really cool how he mentioned he doesn’t like networking! I hate it, feeling very disingenuous toward other people and about a relationship.

I&#39;d like YouTube to bring back video replies

You sit down and record, what, for 1 hr /day? Unless game series. What is the problem of pursuing other things outside of youtube? Sive even edits for you. WHAT would 1 hr more change that is worth giving up youtube. 1 Hour!

Cringy

pwdepi: My voice is so different now then is was beforeNature: thats puberty!

Japan is better than america

So true hahahaha

Hhhhhahhaahahhajaaahahahhaa

What do you eat for breakfast?

Me: Where are the kids FELIX!!!???Felix: <b>hides them in the basement</b>

did anyone else get this recommended lately?

Pewds I know this is a old vid but if you wanna be something different and give just go mr beast and do 1 vid a week and like one of the Mr beast style vids per month just a idea do what you want man love your work you could do alot man since you have such a big platform you could do some good stuff

I think PewDiePie is Legend,His comment section is active still in 2021.

Most of questions are from indians 👍🏽

People who try to push depression as an underlying  feeling on an entertainer are pathetic as hell.

Late to this gem of a video, but the fact that over the 9 years I’ve spent watching this man, I’ve never actually felt that celebrity intimidation I sometimes feel with other public figures never fails to amaze me. He’s humble, intelligent, and self-aware to a degree I never see in celebrities. So much respect for him and I wish nothing but the best for him and his family. 👊

Yo pewds would it be cool if I ever ran into you at like a cafe and just thanked your for everything you’ve made and offered to get you coffee in thanks or would that would be wierd

last

it got recommended i see i see se yall next year mtf

It&#39;s nice to know that the biggest self made Channel has a good head on it

Not cool Zack, not cool. Nuh-uh.
Pewd&#39;s: <b>&quot;It&#39;s really messed up when people pressure you into having a baby&quot;</b>Well Pewd&#39;s cant even have a baby!👦

Don’t quit
“This year was really really hard for me” me watching this in 2021 👁 👄 👁

Was that a tablet he was holding

plx name the baby pewdiepie

thank you pewds, you made my day(I wish I could say this in every video you posted)

Personal

I don&#39;t get why people care so much about celeb&#39;s net worth

I just subbed up don&#39;t let me down b××××
First question: “where do you see yourself after YouTube?” Next question: “why you talking much about politics in last months”He said serious questions lmao

Dude i was you&#39;re 5000Th Dislike

Love from india

lol the next day of felix making this vid the first covid case in UK was seen

<a href="">18:07</a> is the answer

<a href="">14:49</a> but here we go......

Is math related to science?

That’s why I like clutch

First ever q/a which isn’t boring

no offense to my country, but thats why i left singapore... such culture differences.

you remind me of my nephew, hes about your age and has a sense of humor too

Love you Felix💖💖💖
That game in the end is so scawyyy :&lt;

Pewds is a time traveler who keeps forgetting which year he is in

Why does pewds look like Kyle in this vid?

IMAGINE PEWDS JOINING MR BEAST&#39;S CHANNEL AND THEY START GIVING AWAY MONEY TOGETHER

i know that this is a serious video but I just couldn&#39;t stop myself from laughing whenever the camera zooms in because you can see all the noise of the footage like it&#39;s 2014 PewDiePie video. He hasn&#39;t changed at all, not his personality, not his setup, it&#39;s a little bit endearing i should say.

The craziest thing just happened: I never really looked into investing at all but as soon as PewDiePie said that he invest I get an investment ad literally seconds later

Money is a relief. It gives you things to make your life easier. You can travel and see the world. You can experience the world and you can live the full life. You can have the best health insurances...

I know you have a history with IndiaBut please visit India

Yes

Watching the video two years later and laughing at <a href="">14:43</a>

- Write down list- Work then play

this was mere days before the worst year ever and he doesn&#39;t know it yet

pewds: i dont care about moneyalso pewds: BUY MERCH

I&#39;m unsubscribing

I can&#39;t even imagine how happy Jack is with their friendship. Felix was someone Jack looked up to as a creator, and he helped Jack kickstart his career. Now, years and years later, Jack is genuine friends with someone he was a fan of and looked up to in his early days. It&#39;s the path everybody wishes they could take with the entertainers they enjoy.

<a href="">0:21</a> pew news is god but gloria smoria quit

He has a folding phone right? Which one is that?

Hey guys Shreyansh is my friend and we study in same college!

Baby PewDiePie

Glad to see you have found more balance since now

Making your own money felix is you right and spending it also is your right too !! .

Great video

I am here after see thumbnail .

Felix: makes a serious videoAlso felix: put Poopdie as ending

Youtube would die without Pewds, or at least be extremely heavily impacted.

Whatever, we just want &quot;bebe&quot;

Felix you do what you have to do. You make videos until you are 60 and we’ll be here, and if you stop tomorrow then we will reminisce on the good times and look forward to what comes next. That’s life

I am watching you from india

lmao ofc money aint important, you&#39;re already rich bruh.

Beautiful young women get treated like attraction and not a person even without being famous. It sucks!

“She did quit YouTube to kind of leave YouTube” mhm yes

<a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/XjDlXs2qOZbI1wLlxqPYBQ"></a>

Baby when

<a href="">17:24</a> wrong choice

Your phone is.... very wide

PewDieLie
Why tf J didnt see this video before I&#39;m a fan since 2016

Man I hope when the virus dies down you meet with fans

&quot;Minecraft, obviously&quot;That aged well

A 42 minute outdoor podcast ad? YouTube is a joke.

You r the best to ever do it

U definitely look depressed

future: <b>pewdiepie retires</b>internet: <b>breaks</b> world:  <b>war</b> life:   <b>no longer</b>
<a href="">0:45</a> “It makes you wonder what happened to journalism when they didn’t have to use these tactics”Yellow journalism has existed since at least the 1800s. They have always used “clickbait” tactics to sell more papers. The Spanish-American War was started BECAUSE of competing American newspapers making up horror stories about the Spaniards in Cuba to sell more papers.

Pewds gonna be those grandpas un theyre 50s, that become parents, blegh, Will barely get to see theyre children turn 21

I think in 20 years pewds will be making a company selling game accessories. And maybe an advertiser for many games

Note to self:If I ever meet Felix I must ask him if math is related to science

@lordbobby didn&#39;t know this was possible

@Lord bobby didn&#39;t know this was possible

Remember whenever you meet Felix ,you have to ask &quot; Is maths related to science?&quot;

dont leave, ur amazing

I think it would be cool for Pewdiepie to collab with Felix Kjellberg

he mentioned malaysia and singapore loNG LOVE SEA

Watching this after the “congratulations T serious” song I’m CRYING.

Thank you for your work here man, it provided me with some much-needed stability at a time when everything was going downhill. It always surprises me when people/media tries to pin a $ value to you. It&#39;s just priceless to me. I&#39;m watching this video 2 years after it was posted and it still inspires me! This content has no expiration date. It will live on forever and continue to serve as an example of how a man achieved so much just by working hard. Cheers!

He can beat the cocomelon if he became old pewds

Money is not important when you have it, but, VERY important, if you don&#39;;t have it.

He&#39;s wearing the &quot;congratulations&quot; shirt!!

He seems so happy playing minecraft

Your so god damn inspiring
why do u say &quot;does that make sense&quot; so much HAHAHAHAHAAH

You need to do the horror game videos and then scream compilation

For the question about horror games, I like tk watch him play video games but I&#39;d rather watch him react to reddit or youtube videos, or even collabs because he can guide the content unlike when in his game videos where he has to go with the game, thays also why I likehis minecraft series

hi

<a href="">13:28</a> shall we still say is math related to science if we meet him

“I don’t spend it on personal things”Pulls out galaxy z flip

Me watching this in 2021: Wow look at the wall in the mirror!

I like he is honest when he talks money. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m rich, i have more than $40 million, and what about it?&quot; Most of youtubers just lie about it

That ending didn&#39;t age that well. Still, he is the goat for a lot of people.

Knew this was awhile ago when he mentioned going outside

Bean

Yes yes yes.
Felix have gotten good but not just great he have been on this since the first time I saw his first video he always been popular and most subscribed person on YouTube never have I’ve ever thought this loser was gonna make such a big IMPACT... What a great survivor and inspirational to the YOUTH and the world 🌎 around and around.... (Shocking)

I still eat Chinese food 🍱

Networking goes like nowhere lol it’s just blowing hot air into a room.So much clout-chasing and idolatry...

When pewds said he had bigger things to do than YouTube he was taking about his automatic storage system

yes omg the thing he said about networking!!! I totally agree!!!

PewdiePie should be an independant artist vocals are damn good

What do you mean you don.t make big things come on now your  the second most subscribe channel on YouTube you gained 100milion subs from scratch that&#39;s just a huge accomplishment ware here and we&#39;ll still ganna keep watching you

&quot;I think I have more to give&quot;makes floor gang

Hey felix i hope you read this comment and reply to it because its a problem of mine that i need someone to help me in when you were in school did you just want to leave it and play video games and start your channel but your parents wanted you to become educated and thought that school was the inevitable choice for you did they support you or not how did you deal with your passion for gaming and that maybe school and becoming something like an engineer or a doctor wasnt for you how did you deal eith that

when he mentioned the wedding i just remembered a ton od people disliked it wtf

i legit want to meet felix irl and talk about stuff

I can’t tell if this is just me, but does Pewdiepie have  Rule 34 Paheal on his computer?

Call it selfish but I hope you never quit YouTube, Pewdiepie!

Hi Pewds, do you still play Magic, The Gathering: Arena? I would love to see new content. Much love and appreciation.

Damn Felix can get deep if he needs to.

When pewds bro leaves youtube EVERYONE ALIVE ONE EARTH WILL REALLY CRY FROM HEART!!

But now I wanna know, well Idk if he will answer, but my first question is, what happened with Markiplier? And the other, what was closest to a breakup with Marzia?

People: Will PewDiePie quit youtube?Me: If he does then, well it would have to be Ryan taking over the platform.

A little part of me dies each time I watch your videos. No I dont want your life.. (Fame &amp; Fortune) but I&#39;m more envious how you found everlasting love; so it appears! That would be ultimate BIG-pp moment in my life too!I really appreciated this Q&amp;A. It was wholesome and real!

Everyone : watching to PewDiePieMe: observing surrounding of his room by the mirror..

“pracly” so fucking precious
<a href="">15:22</a> hit different idk
I apologise on behalf of Malaysians

It&#39;s crazy this video was made a year ago already. Time flies is no joke

Hi felix I love ur vids u rock

dude i just watched half of the vid without realising cuz i was thinking of how do i react if i ever meet pewds irl

Fans to Marzia and Felix are like those annoying family friends that always ask &quot;so where are children? I think you are pretty old already!&quot;

<a href="">6:40</a> my uncle foesnttouch me anymore ☹️😣
<a href="">6:40</a> my uncle doesnt want to touch me anymore ☹️

<a href="">4:29</a>

I am the 600k like on this vid :)

<a href="">19:01</a> 2020

I like that the comments he reads don’t usually have likes

&quot;I am very into the things I like to do&quot;

the 3k people that disliked this video are psycopath. even pysco&#39;s dont dislike. The best current estimate is that just less than 1% of all noninstitutionalized males age 18 and over are psychopaths. This translates to approximately 1,150,000 adult males who would meet the criteria for psychopathy in the United States today.

Pewdiepie can you do youtube when You trun 40 year old

don&#39;t please don&#39;t quit maybe stop the daily vids but no don&#39;t stop vids please

ok my question: whos your parents

I don&#39;t watch pewdiepie as much as I did as I was young or when he first came out, I&#39;m taking a bit of a peek. Lol its interesting knowing we where always a year appart watching him growing up. Its really cool what he did with YouTube.  I do miss Marzia but I&#39;m glad she&#39;s happy.

feels like I&#39;m growing up with him and it&#39;s weird cuz I liked the content before, but I like ut more now and sometimes it is kinda cringe to watch the old videos, so that&#39;s why I think it feels like growing up and getting better as a person

the kazoo kid is back and stronger than ever

&quot;I think people want money for the novelty&quot; No pewds people are poor. They pay rent to hoarding lazy landlords and get paid peanuts whilst CEOs buy yachts.

Name the baby Pewdiepie Kjellberg

until you are on youtube it will be forever the best website at least for a 100 million bros

This was before corona.Remember that

<a href="">6:58</a> So what you&#39;re saying is Clutch came in clutch

He&#39;s not depressed he&#39;s a scorpio lol

Don&#39;t quit youtube! Keep making videos! Better than Netflix!

ik i&quot;ll probably never meet felix but if i do how tf am just going to go up to him and be like &quot;is math related to science?&quot;

<b>PEWDIEPIE FINALLY REACHES 109M WAY TO GO KING!</b>

he’s so freaking intelligent
<a href="">5:36</a> please someone do a &quot;still D.R.E&quot; mashup with this timestamp

The questions: dumb as hellThe answer: smart

why does it look like you just glued 2 phones together

So anyways when are you quitting YouTube?

This guy is so honest, bless him

Investing in socks and buns? Nice!

i LOVE how he says &quot;Questien&quot;

I &quot;wonder&quot; <b>what pewds is doing Ryt now</b> ?

I’m so happy he’s not thinking of quitting YouTube

The Game at the end gives me huge &#39;Binding of Isaac&#39; vibes I love it

Make bebe

Pewds, recently discovered “Smarter News”, a girl who is truly passionate about objective journalism and keeping bias out. She’s wonderful and as an outspoken critic of the pervasiveness of rhetoric (persuasion) in journalism, ive been really happy with her work. She follows very traditional journalistic standards. She refers to people by their official titles, she tries to give her listeners access to primary sources of information, she gives as much info possible from all sides. She has no narrative apart from giving people as many confirmed facts as possible and ive really been happy with her work.

I agree that MOST OF THE PEOPLE are morons

pewds mixing up the years is sooo adorable lol

I TOLD EVERYONE THAT WE WERE BEST FRIENDS. SO IF ANYONE ASKS JUST TELL THEM YES PLEASE PEWDSIE.

you should acct in a movie

Hi pewdiepiebanned
Bruh, he has beautiful blue eyes

There has to be a correlation between his honesty and his following . So many youtubers would fake answers to these questions, to please the needy fans . Felix is honest and everyone loves him more... hmm weird

I’ve realized that if we couldn’t see that many updates or videos with Felix and Marzia, I’d be disheartened to see them “leave” but whether or not they’re happy with their decision is what matters the most. I find it wholesome to even feel that way towards these two :’)

Is that folding phone?

If I got 1$ every time Pewds said &quot;and&quot; in this video, I would be a rich man!

wtf is that device youre contaminating your hands with

How good is your japanese?

AAAjh japan

Felix: I don’t like having things around me.He says while a camera is directed against his face while he’s talking to himself.

Ah, he&#39;s so intelligent i love listening to him talk honestly

doesn’t care about money and doesn’t like having expensive things around him.<b>casually pulls out galaxy fold</b>

Fans 0.0000000000001 seconds after a person gets married : BABY I THINK SHE IS PREGGY

Pewdiepie: can you ask me questions 9 year olds: when are you quitting? Do you like YouTube? Are you a weeb?

What I Expected: you need to understand that everyone has their own opinions and blah blah blah etcPewds: what you need to understand is that everyone is a fucking moron

Pewd&#39;s: idk whats important to me....Pewd&#39;s GF: ok, I see now

I just got this recommended twice.I clicc

Yeha but I watch you since I was 6 and I wanted to meet you so bad like u were like what I used to watch instead of tv so u can’t really blame people like I will say hi but I wish I could say more like hey I’ve watch u since I was 6 can I have a photo because that photo would mean more to me than getting a photo from a big time celebrity

He already have 108 million 19 year old kids ... ...........

I don&#39;t want a lot or money, I just want enough money that I don&#39;t cry at night because I feel like I&#39;m going to starve to death or lose my home.

This was before we knew that 2020 would be the worst year in modern time

To be honest, if you don&#39;t have children, there is no purpose in your life. Sorry pewds.

so weird idiots calling pewds a white supremacist when he&#39;s definitely a japanese supremacist lol

Pewds: I think the important bit is to understand that everyone is a f*cking moron<b>i felt that</b>

I really like how honest and open he is and can speak about serious things interestingly while still. being funny

Hey pewds! I know it&#39;s been about two years since you did the amnesia hard mode gameplay and it&#39;s probably irrelevant by now, but if you ever have an extra second, I would love to see you finish that gameplay! I used to watch your original amnesia content when it aired and it would mean a lot to me to see that now as an adult. No pressure though! I completely understand if you are unable to, just wanted to try. Love you pewds!

love these type of videos! I know you probably will never see this but I actually made this account when I was 12 years old to watch you and now I am 20 years old and still watch and enjoy, how time flies 😁

do this again.

If Facebook and YouTube die before I die I&#39;ma be a Stressy Bessy
You just have to know that we all love you Pewds

How to make pewdiepie character in minecraft have baby: put in frick chamber with wife, throw food at them (carrots, potatoes, and melons), then watch intently as the baby making process will occur.

If I’m 25 can i still be a 19 year old ?

Why Marzia quit Youtube
pewds...i was on loud bruh.... you scare the shit in me...damn..

how long is PP, Felix?

Don&#39;t like people asking you about kids but use it as the thumbnail of the video. Just saying.

Fav yt
Answering personal questions How rich are you?<b>Avoids answer</b>

Today i recognized, that there is a mirror, not room behind him.

Now I don&#39;t know if I should actually say &quot;Is math related to science?&quot; If I meet you in public haha

&quot;<a href="">13:15</a>&quot; We can&#39;t even speak to you because you feel like you&#39;re too popular, I dont see it as normal person

welcome 2020

pooods

This better be good i saw it in my suggestions and i left acdc&#39;s new album for this

Where is the “baby when?” question?????

I’m here

took 11 months for the next one

As a big fan of &quot;The Anime Man&quot; (who is a small youtuber compared to Felix) I was really hoping he&#39;d mention him when he was talking about youtube collabs (since they&#39;ve done a few videos together) but the way he described networking as a youtuber made me feel like he collabed with Joey to give him more clout which makes me sad :( I really wanted them to be genuine friends

Actual time that he talks about having kids: <a href="">18:01</a>

The bit about the baby is extremely true. It made me realize that viewers mostly see YouTubers as “relatable caged animals” when they’re simply just other human beings. I’ve never understood the whole “pressuring serious life choices” mantra that so many people hold. Viewers, please understand that “asking Pewds to play X game” is different from “asking Pewds to make X serious life altering choice.” Please, just let creators be in that realm. They shouldn’t be pestered just as you shouldn’t be pestered, so for the people that pressure them, imagine if millions of people were demanding that you had a child when you felt you weren’t ready to have one.

“Worst performing video” has 3.2 million views. Christ, Felix.

Doesn&#39;t spend money on personal things as he doesn&#39;t like having things around him...Ah, the innocent days before !Tambourine Tower! and a giant mountain horn!!

ok butdo you even want kids thoi feel click baited &gt;:(((

Helo

Man i really wish to meet you once in my lifetime.

I know the thing that pewds likes most about Japan is their toilets

Pewdiepie is the realest youtuber ever

The guy who took that photo  with flash watching this video 🙄

Hey Felix, don&#39;t let people pressure you into having a baby. I&#39;m sorry so many comments say it in your videos. I don&#39;t think a lot of people realize that many couples are happy with not having a child. But sadly, those people don&#39;t like to accept that fact. It all depends on you and Marzia&#39;s happiness, and if it&#39;s not having a child, that&#39;s completely fine. I know that you already know this, but I wanted to still give a little more closure. The two of you already seem happy enough without a baby, it just sucks too many people can&#39;t grasp that. Though a lot of people are saying it as a joke, it&#39;s still immensely messed up when someone isn&#39;t joking at all and continues to try to pressure.Just always remember you don&#39;t need to cater to them and everyone else.A lot of those people also don&#39;t realize how fucking tough and exhausting kids are. I&#39;ve had to babysit just a newborn baby, and yet that one was <b>still</b> energy draining. Children are a huge, huge responsibility and are expensive as hell. But many viewers go- &quot;A married couple on Youtube? Give baby now!&quot; <b>multiple</b> times and it&#39;s the dumbest thing I have ever seen. They say that they know how children are, but if they really <b>understood</b> the feeling, they wouldn&#39;t be spamming in your comments section that rude as hell question. You don&#39;t ask people multiple times if they&#39;re having a baby no matter how many times they say no or hint at not wanting any, it&#39;s immensely disrespectful and a childish move.

Man if I saw Felix irl I’d just ask for a brofist deadass. Ten year old me has been waiting for a decade lmfao

Wait what happened in 2017 was it that time &quot;he liked the editing&quot; or &quot;gear for knees&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like to have many things around me&quot;*buys dozens of tambourines and an alphorn

Pewds dodged the first question like its child support

I watch anime (and play japanese games) but I have to agree on Japan. Japan is cool and it&#39;s so much more than anime.

Great video! I&#39;m was surprised when you mentioned music. A very interesting answer, indeed!

3322

Agree on the baby part :) They should make the decision when they want and comfortable with it.

I wish I was in a place in my life that I could nonchalantly claim that I dont care about money

When you gonna make more videos about books???? 😵

See? This is the reason why many people hate Felix.He&#39;s REAL with himself, not a fake person like many out there just to sell a product or something.I&#39;m not saying that all the other youtubers are jerks, don&#39;t understand me wrong. Respect Felix.

haha im still here

Remember the magic words &quot;Is math related to Science&quot;

Looking for that guy in the comments who tells us where that baby question actually is

hes not that dumb to have kids LOL.. who likes stereotype life maybe shitty normie? :D

pewds: hope everything simmer down this 20202020: how about NO

What&#39;s up

pewdiepie saying collaborating with friends and random people is awesome.Saiman crying in a corner

why is pewds phone so wide

Pewdie is starting to look like his 2015 self again and for some reason it makes me so happy ♥️

him saying so much has happened this year and its hard to proccess.... us in 2020 ._.

Why is the thumbnail set to look like a Genius thumbnail?

I like the old pewdiepie that did meme review!

Note to self: If you see Pewdiepie/Marzia, ask them &quot;Is Math related to Science?&quot;.

Well, maybe felix is right about the money but also i would like to have a pc whos newest part isn&#39;t from 2009.

These are great.Hope you end up with a legendary streak with YouTube, Felix.Wishin you much happiness for the future, bror.

I really didn&#39;t expect Pewds to answer questions this seriously....

a lot of people try to hide the fact that they have a foreign accent, but i feel like felix is forcing a swedish accent most of the time

i just bought a pewdiepie mask

Pewds : I don&#39;t like things around me.The dozens of tambourines:

Next Q&amp;A im gonna ask if he’s time traveling because he keeps forgetting what year we’re in lmao

thank you for acknowledging this is a very personal fucking question.

I don&#39;t understand YouTube&#39;s punishments. Felix got so much taken away from him in 2017, but Logan Paul&#39;s Japan mishap got him a slap on the wrist at most.

OMG HE&#39;S SO HANDSOME (sarcasm)

“Will you make a philosophy video?” Answers “maybe” in a philosophy video

You don&#39;t care about money because you don&#39;t have to worry about it

They came in clutch™️

What scandal broke there in 2017?

i actually noticed that more than half of the questions were asked by indians, i am also an indian so i can understand indian names.......

felix: <b>talks about money for 5 minutes straight</b>me: and you still can’t buy a better camera 😒

When Baby?

he got confused and said another year instead of 2020 TWICEhe knew it all

just watching this after a corpse video, never realised that felix sounds like a kitten =^o_o^=

Implying there&#39;s gonna be an after YouTube I see? HmMmMmMmMm

<a href="">3:14</a> meanwhileMarkiplier crying meme

Omggg your hair loooooook sooooooo goooooooood
i think my computer glitched im tryna watch pewdiepie not justin beiber

First 2 answers didn&#39;t answer the questions.  lets fucking go

God, you seem always so fucking annoyed answering questions, kinda makes me laugh xd

I&#39;m just waiting for pewdiepie to host snl (probably not gonna happen I&#39;m sure it would be cool tho)

Why is this getting recommended to me nearly a year later

this is authenticity.

<a href="">16:43</a> killed me

I also love how he chooses more unpopular and recent comments. He didn&#39;t just jump into 3k liked comments but searched for the real and serious ones

If you’ve come here because of the thumbnail, it’s inconclusive

who would&#39;ve thought 2020 be this fucked up i miss normal lifeeee

can you make a montage video that could get 1M comments in 3 months?

I know youtube recomended this for u

nice clickbait. none of these questions are personal whatsoever

What happened on the bridge?

I eat food to not be hungry y

<a href="">16:06</a> &quot;I think music would be fun to work with.&quot; tAmBoUrInE aNd aLpHoRn mUsIc vIdEo cOnFiRmEd?!?!?!?!?!

youtubers need a union

<a href="">3:52</a> lmao I thought you said &quot;socks and bongs&quot; XD

is that a flip phone? lmao

This is part of why I love watching PewDiePie. His content is entertaining, but the longer you watch, and the more videos you see like this one, you see just what a normal guy he is. There are few celebrities like that. It&#39;s really cool. He&#39;s the kind of person I feel like I could bump into at a grocery store and have a normal conversation with instead of losing my sanity cuz he&#39;s famous.

Felix: has wifeInternet: B A B Y  W H E N

Bye! UwU
<a href="">16:06</a> yes!!! Mine All Day is a banger

That&#39;s gonna be quite an irrelevant comment. But. I love you. I genuinely do. I&#39;ve loved for 7 seven years now and, i guess, you will always remain in my heart. Plus i hated you for some time before 2014, so lol

Hey pewdiepie baby, when?

☝️ hold your death ill be back in 9 years to see how yer holding up👈 ill get poppy corn

🙄

damn I really love his honesty and “cut the bullshit” attitude when making these kinds of videosNot to mention, he doesn’t pretend to care about the things he doesn’t care about even after becoming a big personality, and I’m living for it

That thumbnail tho

Welcome to married life... where is babe? Where is second babe? I have fur babies and I am happy with that.

Sooo.... when bebe??

When are you quitting? Do you feel like quitting? Maybe you should quit, yes?

its been nine months since this video was uploaded. where is bebeh?

BEBE! NOWWWWW

sorry that sg and malaysia gave you such a bad impression HAHAH i think we do have this strange culture of going very crazy when relatively well-known people are around. but there are exceptions to this behaviour :) anyway sending love!

it would be so good to make a music whit corpse its could be so good but its my thought lol

9 month passed, where&#39;s mini pewds?

The thing about money, I think, is that usually, people value more the money than the work that is behind it, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re always asking how much you make. And, from what I can see, for you the money it&#39;s just a consequence of your work, of course, you value it, but it&#39;s not your main motivation for doing what you do.

Who else herd symphony in the biginning

this getting recommended to me 9 months later 👁👄👁

Uploaded 9 months ago lol geuss he didn&#39;t decide baby now back then

whyd yt give me this exactly 9 months after release...

if the baby is bad send him to the ranch

<b>THIS VIDEO WAS RELEASED A DAY BEFORE CORONA OUT BREAK....</b>

The amnesia mod was really funny ngl

16 35

The thumbnail and the fact this was 9 months ago... 👀👀

If I ever had the opportunity to meet Felix I wouldn’t even ask him for a picture. I’m not about that and he’s a human being who deserves to be treated like everyone else. I would most likely come up to him say obviously his math related to science and then asked if he is busy. If he was to say no then Id ask if I could ask him a quick question. And leave him be maybe ask for a hug but I’m pretty uncomfortable so I doubt I’d be that bold.

You are great

Would you still be living Sweden if you didn’t meet Marzia?

i think you deserve to make a living out of youtube

wish that you can read it .. i just wanna to say thanks ..

Remember that haircut!

<a href="">9:01</a> you forgot something, you also defeated the ender dragon

lol I see it now. All those dad jokes Felix was making more frequently in his videos like 3 weeks ago? That was to fuck with the people asking &quot;OMG WHEN IS BEBE COMING&quot;

Me watching this in 2052 :)

MAKE BEBE NOW!!

Mark, Jack and Pewds I don’t care if you have masks and are sick feet apart I want to see it!👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻

This is getting recommended 9 months later, nice Youtube

I always think its funny how people that have money always say its not important. Like I get what they mean by it, about how it doesn&#39;t bring you happiness and all. With that said if you, like most people, dont have f u money then of course its important. Life is different when you need to pay attention to how much food you buy each week and how many times you go out to eat or else you may not be able to pay the bills at the end of the month. Or when if you get an unexpected medical expense and wonder how you are going to be able to pay for it.Money is freedom, and people that have it should stop acting like its no big deal. Its a huge deal, and changes your whole way of thinking even without you realizing it.

I genuinely love when pewds does this because I love hearing him talk about his views on situations and topics.. he should definitely do more of these 🤍

whys he so bad with years

Amnesia or Minecraft<b>Hmmmm...so be unable to remember certain things in the past, or play one of the best games ever</b>Tough.....

<a href="">5:45</a> YouTube is your job, of course you monetize the videos.

Dude I love how smart this man actually is. He can be so silly and fun while also being so smart and logical

<a href="">2:11</a> That&#39;s what Tony Stark said when he became Iron Man

This was posted 9 months ago and no baby pewds

Felix, take some time off. I know this is a late comment, but focus on yourself and your life first.

yess so here for ur music! I think you&#39;d write really interesting lyrics

You can really see how Felix is so genuine about having a platform in youtube where he just. Wants. To. Do. Youtube. But with other people, they use youtube to have a platform to gain audience THEN start a business that is irrelevant to their channel. Iduuno wild thoughts.

Totaly thought the bubbles on the wedding photo were shutterstock watermarks and it killed me

I think people are so used to using YouTube that they have to mess up REALLY badly to lose their spot to another platform

It&#39;s been 9 month thooo

The fact is half(may be less) of the questions were from Indians lmao

Don&#39;t rush into kids. Enjoy eachother. I&#39;m a single mom of 2 boys and I always tell Many people just let it be natural and enjoy your alone time bc you won&#39;t have any qt all when you have kids

Hallo, I am from the future, 9 months and 17 days to be exact, and I am here to tell you about an incoming pandemic. Yes at the time this video is being filmed, somewhere in china a smol pp move is about to be done, I think, there&#39;s a pandemic and this pandemic is going to destroy us, please help us, help yourself from this disaster, pewds or anyone, help us, help your future selves, people of the past.

Rewatch this and see how your views change

i thought he got into genius . but it&#39;s an old video ._.

Everytime I see the serious side of felix, the thing that come to mind is how well articulated he is.

kinda ironic how this is in my recommended 9 months later

Where?

You big bran
Love your vids! Keep up the great content! Also I have some beats for you if you&#39;d like to take up music!

The fact that pewds forgets to mention 2020 everytime he has to is what doomed 2020

i think everyone is asking if you&#39;re quitting  cuz they dont want you to or at least i think

7.15 markiplier

Yea pewds is right celebs are also normal people treat them normally

You don&#39;t have to have kids right after marriage, or a year after marriage, I am the eldest of 3, I was conceived 3 years after my parents married.

I just searched ,,when will pewdiepie have a child&quot; and find this. Come on, really, when? Marzia will be a good mother. You just have to do the thing and done. 😂

<a href="">16:38</a> ur welcome

I don&#39;t think it is naive to say that you have more to give. I would like to listen to more serious topics you have in mind, but i guess sharing your real opinions without making fun of yourself... would cause a lot of people to stress you out even more. I assume as famous as you are, it must be hard because everything you say will be put on a scale. Maybe you shouldn&#39;t care and do it anyway.. but i completely understand if you don&#39;t want all the extra attention.

I love how this video appeared in my recommendations after 9 months 😭😭😭

Felix should stop when he&#39;s 69 y o

Pewds: I think music could be a fun thing to explore as a passion.Me: Nah you&#39;ve made Bitch Lasagna you&#39;ve peaked

Super rude to ask about kids, never know who can and can’t have them

If Marzia has babyDon’t vlog the birth JustDon’t

The kids? You mean Edgar and Maya?

from Canada...... keep staying way from sexy beaver people and or natives please look into woman going missing native woman on the highway between wl to pg to up more north please

Baby when?

Felix we nead babe your already 30! when Your gonna Have CHILD!!!!😭

imagine if that break ended as a forever goodbye... we wouldn&#39;t have floor gang, alabama, tlc , Among Us streams, floor gang, tower of tambourine, and the list could go on. The power he holds is IMMENSE..

<a href="">17:52</a> made me sad :(

When he is assuring us he is not into money whilst scrolling on his £1200 phone 🤣 I love you Felix 💜

The thought of Pewds retiring makes me sad. He has been a huge part of our lives. Like seeing someone everyday for 9 yrs, and that stops. 😞

who ever see this comment may God give your parents long life 🥰🥰

pewds: &quot;i think i like playing with ken and jack a lot&quot;me: &quot;............... what about Cry :(&quot;

It&#39;s so easy for people with money to say they don&#39;t care about money...

Where do you see yourself in 20 years?  Try where do you see yourself in 8 months dude!  :/

wtf is that phone

i like this kind of content from him. he seems like a well educated person and its so nice to see him grow so much from his experiences. he makes a lot of good points from the questions and i respect his answers. those may be the most reasonable explanations that fits with me.

:)

Everybody gangsta till pewds pull out the box iPhone

I think hed be great at producing really artistic videos with strong messages. Next move = edgy and important videos

You dodged the bullet with Disney... Those fools are about to get wrecked.

He&#39;s such a nice person i&#39;m glad ive been watching his vids for having fun for years

do not quit, i love your videos. love you marzia maya and edgar so much

Mark: <b>sad noises</b>
Hi

106 million subscribers. thats so crazy! At least your NOT a douche! And your funny. I have 55 subs lol.

This is pewds when he was normal

Wait for it,2020 is coming to make it tough

I thing pewds baby would have a beard

<a href="">3:08</a> so thats how pewds enter his house

I feel like Pewds is just flexing his Galaxy Fold.

Imagine when a more better site for making content comes and then content creators  there sponsor YouTube XD

In 2011 he was a descent but now🙄

You hate other country, visit Philippines then.

Drinking game: take a shot whenever Pewds say probably, personally, and in general😂

All the comments: wHerE Arë thE cHindRenMinEcrAft viLlagEes bE liKe wE Had aN opTioN!?!?!?!Me:look at his phone😱😱😱😨😨😨😵😵
<a href="">18:02</a> thank me later

Hi Felix, you answer to your networth is absolutely admireble and really cool you just speak out about it. Most people are affraid of talking money when they got good amounts of it. You are a huge inspiration. You are awesome, bro.

He DEFINITELY has more to give!

Pewds: “Clutch was really loyal to me in those times”I guess clutch really came in clutch

I need friends like Felix and Marzia, I feel like there aren’t many genuine people around like them anymore

Don’t feel bad making money. It’s cool you don’t flex and don’t waste money on stupid crap like big houses and lots of cars because that’s actually really boring, but it’s nice having money. Remember how much it sucked selling hot dogs and not having options like buying a shirt or book you like or had to add everything up as you’re putting things in the cart at the grocery store? Most of us have to live like that, so be proud that you made it and don’t have to live like that anymore. We’re happy for your success.

<a href="">19:20</a> u look like crazy stupid funny guy

He doesn&#39;t look like the same person at all

It&#39;s at <a href="">18:00</a>

<a href="">6:07</a> &quot;I hope in 2020 I can start living by own ideals more&quot;2020: sounds good but doesn&#39;t work

Baby when?

Pewds: I just want things to calm down a little...Cashier at burger joint: SIMMER DOWN NAH

<a href="">4:50</a> like Casey neistat and 368

well i,m not even a gamer and i just find you so fing funny.......

let&#39;s see what will happen if watching will subscribe me what will happen just do it

why are they acting like felix&#39;s and marzia&#39;s in-laws lmao

&quot;I think in 2020 I will be able to living by my own ideals more&quot;2020: &quot;My Big Tambourine PP will reach the moon!&quot;Every Pewds video ages like wine.

This is one of his most sober videos.

When is YLYL coming back??

Everytime the cam zooms in i hope something funny will pop up

Best question:When will we meet junior PewDiePie

i thought he spend his money on his Tambourine Factory 😂

Everyone thinks your a weeb when you pick the ae86 in racing games :l

99% people can not see this comment but If 1% people saw this comment Then you will happy all day!!!!!!

its kinda annoying how people were pressuring them to have a kid when they have been married for 4 months here.

Where is pewdiepie !Aanndd why the frick is felix is sitting on his chair

Karma is real!

Pewdiepie after marriageAudience:Make Babe
Man you really look like you don’t like your job

dont use that phone . its bad. and expensive. thats why i dont use it

this is like a podcast for me

Question:who will continue your legacy?

If someone had a baby because they were pressured to do it the whole miracle of life would become somewhat sour. With that being said I do think Felix should have a kid soon, he is thirty and hes got plenty of money and hes experienced a lot in his life already and it isn&#39;t like his life would even be over after he has a kid anyways, I wouldn&#39;t want to have a kid when I&#39;m like 35 or older because me and them would be from completely different times and there would be a disconnect there for sure. That is just what I think, have a kid or don&#39;t have a kid, not my business.

Pewds is gonna pull a George Washington on us I feel it coming

who else talks to themself when playing games, as if they were a youtuber?

If you want kids do quickly your sperm will die like mine so I had to adopt

I like how honest you are. :D Yipee!

Pewds makes tons of money but also have tons of money to give to many charities. You&#39;re really the MAN

Without money, trust me, you wouldn&#39;t feel the same

I think one of the reasons why Pewdiepie continued to grow so much is because he wasnt held back by big companies and their expectation. But ThAt&#39;S jUsT a ThEoRyRespect Felix, love what you do and I, like many others, look up to you. It&#39;s been an honour to get to watch you grow both as a person and a creator. Keep it up!

Don’t burn yourself out. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Love your channel! I’m an older lady btw. So take that for your demographic model :)

I feel that felix would be the happiest person if he had 500k subs

Well,u have to be that rich when u actually doesn&#39;t care about money

Shut up people, stop searching for baby PewDiePie! Why is this vid came back to my recommendations 😂! Shtop!

that&#39;s assuming youtube doesn&#39;t do some shit

this
everyone’s always asking “how did pewds” but not “how is pewds”

Is that a galaxy fold???

Even him just talking is watchable &amp; entertaining

He says socks instead of stocks 😂

Pewdiepie: &quot;It&#39;s really messed up when people pressure you into having a baby&quot;Also Pewdiepie &quot;GET INTO THE FRICKING CHAMBER&quot;

&quot;this year sucks&quot;Those watching the video in 2020: Hah- poor innocent Felix.

wait what about mark???

I will always watch pewds even if he dies I will rewatch his videos millions of times

In my opinion, I’m the only one here who listens to Pewdiepie’s English speech in order to understand the English language 😂
I don&#39;t understand sneaking a photo. You, at best, get an uninteresting, low-quality shot of the celebrity. It doesn&#39;t seem special and doesn&#39;t highlight actually meeting the person

Fri- Thursday’s with peeewwwwwwdieeepieee

His kid gonna be watching these old videos and saying, The hell os floorgang? Was I made just for fans??

I mean it makes sense for him to still put ads and do sponsors i mean look at jeff bezos and bill gates there the richest people on earth but they still get more money they dont just give up on everything when there on top

Sub to jacksucksatlife

&quot;I am verry into the things I like to do&quot; - Pewdiepie 2020

why he can&#39;t face the camera???..when he looks towards the cam. he always look away..

“My voice is so different... I hope I finally find a voice” *inaudible yelling at minecraft animals - 2020

This is what i like about japan:They dont care what we think about them. They dont bow down or bend knees on demand. They do things and if west doesnt like it west can go fuck itself

What the hell is he holding

i hate stories! anyway i posted one...

this video was created a day before a chaotic year

welyn

the fact you said “money is not that important” is accurate for your case according to the maslow hierarchy of needs. Since u have archieved all the basic necessities in your life like food and money it’s basically all about potential interest of your own that can gain respect from others. You live your life to the fullest and that’s awesome. Thank you for pursuing your dream, i fulfill mine watching you.

damn pewds&#39; qna&#39;s are different

Pwed&#39;s channel has some good videos, very good videos but none that feature the man are or can be bad

I appreciate pewds on YouTube, he’s very reasonable when it comes to his opinions and expresses them with understanding from both sides. He comes across as genuinely genuine and I truly appreciate that. Him and Jenna have been my faves since I was a young teen; theyre one of the foundations of what makes YouTube great.

I just thought and practiced about what to do and what words I have to say when I met him which is probably not gonna happen but still😅

Pewdiepie I think you are getting the words naive and cliche mixed up.  (no hate)

much love pewds. you DO have more to give!!! BELIEVE. i think therefore i am &lt;3

I bought a pewdiepie chair and thought it could be better now it declines all the way to the floor CAN YOU DO THIS THO

Your super self aware teach me your ways

He speaks so fluently <b>except numbers. numbers are stupid</b>

What he said about Japan is the same with Korea. K-pop is the least most interesting thing about Korea (and it&#39;s actually quite annoying lol). Korean language is so interesting to learn, and how they combine super technological stuff with their old tradition and make an unique country is really cool

I just got that u can never com to india

<a href="">27:34</a> <b>thank me later Bois</b>

<a href="">7:18</a> Felix : &quot;I think our content went in different directions&quot;Also Felix : * plays minecraft * Mark : * also plays minecraft * HMMMMMMMMMMMM 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
The Internet with PewDiePie: wholesome

<b>Talks about passion, music as medium</b>Me: Recalls hit music video &#39;bitch lasagna&#39;

Do anyone else too go to check the quality of his videos. 🤨

People always say &#39;have a baby, it&#39;s amazing!&#39; &#39;You don&#39;t understand how amazing it is until you have one!&#39;Then when you get pregnant, those same people do a complete 180 to &#39;get sleep while you can&#39;, &#39;enjoy a clean house while can&#39;, and list off all the crap things about kids.Moral if the story: Misery loves company Have kids if you want, or don&#39;t have kids. But don&#39;t let others decide or pressure you.

I am a Singaporean and can agree that the fans here for literally anyone are mostly crazy and loose it which is really irritating cuz it tends to chase people away

Some day you will watch your last PewDiePie video

but to be honest here Felix, i hope you are reading this. you said you don&#39;t like the recognition and people asking to take picture with you. But bro, you are making videos which are uploaded to the internet. This is what you get for signing up to this job. It is the same with actresses/actors, they have to lose their freedom in order to get the money and fame. That is why this job is not for everyone. Just wanna let you know.

The saddest moment would be when Pewds quits YouTube or when he dies.......

This guys gonna be 40 in ten years, i was watching him when he was like 20 dude jesus

Why did I read the title in his voice

Lol I’ll try to remember to say is math related to science 😂 if I ever see you

Do you remember pewds does everything and Fridays with Pewdiepie?

it would be AN HONOR FOR PEWDIEPIE to call me a idiot

PewDiePie: <b>Makes a video</b>5yr Olds: “wHoS wAtChInG iN 6969?”

Did anyone notice that PewDiePie has a Samsung Folding Phone?

<a href="">18:01</a> | Thank me late bros. 👊
Is anyone watching in July 2020 or just me?

<a href="">12:55</a>That story in Italy killed me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

What phone does he have in this vid? It looks like some square.

He is into the things he likes to do!!!!!

this whole video he forgot 2020 even existed. a prophecy if u ask me

Thanks for the information!!!👍👍👍
This is random but you know how t series got more subscribers than Felix but if you look at how many views they get compared to Felix... Felix will always be the winner

I love this man

Pewds lives in present

I met pewds once And i said can i take a selfie and he said &quot;yea sure&quot; and thats why i love pewds

why does it look like he has 2 phones taped together

<a href="">7:12</a>  Just you wait until Mark hits 70 mln subs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Let’s play a game of how many times can you reiterate the same question

Back on the internet from 2013. What have i missed?

Imagine that you are seccesful enough to pick your job by the fun and not the pay lol

Whats the name of his phone?? Looks cool

hearing him say having things around him annoys me makes me lol

if its not you&#39;re money you care about can I have you&#39;re money.

Please never quit

If you quit I will feel really lonely though  I&#39;m gonna miss you so much. Good that now you still here. I love growing old with you.

Hey Felix Ava is a good name for a baby ✌️

this hair style is supreme

I believe that you don&#39;t make merch for the money. You do it because you want to give something for your fans. I think you are genuine and honest all over and I love you for it!

50 % QandA 50% philosophy

where is marzia

Why you&#39;re so good at speaking English even you&#39;re a Swedish?

De ja vu. Help me where did i see this before

OK BUT IF YOU DID PLAY HAPPY WHEELS OUT OF NO WHERE I WOULD FUCKING BE HERE FOR IT PEWDS LOL

Question: &quot;how do you deal with hate?&quot;Pewds: &quot;well I think it&#39;s important to remember that everyone&#39;s-&quot;Me, rolling my eyes: entitled to their own opinio-Pewds: <b>a fucking moron</b>Me: :)

[Innocently watching Pewds talk] [Trump ad runs] Me: <b>burn this cancer before it spreads</b>(Btw ik pewds can&#39;t control which ads play on his videos, I just think Trump should go into the forever box and never come back out)

This was posted 6 months ago and felix looks completely different ahhaha

What phone is he using?

No

A single kid is too much kids! 😂

I would like it very much if you continue to let us be a part of your life until we are old men. I&#39;m 37 and I feel like we are similar people who have different types of lives due to the randomness of the universe.

As a musician, I can tell you, it is very expressive but it takes a VERY long time to learn and understand. A lot of the YouTubers that try to do music are absolutely deluded as they likely can’t even find middle c on the grand staff. They hire an actual musician to make them a track and then they write lyrics and sing whatever “sounds right,” without being able to recognize why it sounds right or be able to make it even more powerful and do a better job at expressing what you want. I personally don’t write music with lyrics, I view it as a handycap, more effective to tell a story than to express emotion. I have written a song that’s supposed to be about people who say they are something they aren’t, specifically musicians because when people say that it feels like all the work I’ve put into it has been disrespected and disregarded. The song is called deluded, and it’s more about (inspired) how I feel when I see people call themselves a musician when they can’t tell you the name of the treble and bass clef. While I’m ranting about music with/ without lyrics tho, a song I really like that does tell a story without a single line of registered language is Pixel Galaxy by Snail’s House, such a powerful arrangement. Like I don’t really write lyrics, I don’t really listen to them much either, while there are absolutely fantastic lyrical arrangements out there (think, Lost Boy,) a lot of them are the same story, involving an untrusting love and betrayal, it’s boring, and predictable, you hear it a lot in pop. I get that these experiences stick with people, but that doesn’t mean it’s been milked a little too much. A great lyrical song that is more about emotion is Hyper Potion, Mega Flare, and Syleaf’s Where We Wanna Be. A song about meeting a group of friends you haven’t seen in a long time, a feeling I think most of us have felt that feeling of reunion in the past it’s special. If you haven’t, don’t worry, I’m sure this is an emotion you will feel the first time you hang out with your friends once quarantine is lifted. Back to be song, the lyrics are vague yet you get such a vivid image in your head of what they are describing, because the four people making this track had a specific feeling they wanted to convey and they did so with the music, using the lyrics to add to that with imagery. The line “Working day and night, I know that you’re tired,” very clearly emits exhaustion, tension, suspense, and hey excitement. No lyrics can fit why in its own, that was music at work, conveying those emotions.

He says he wants personal questions yet he seems agitated to me :/

journalism is dead

Zezima&#39;s twin - he achieved max level on everything in runescape before anyone else. Felix achieved what any solo YouTuber has before they will, or have. FLOOR GANG

this is the most honest statement i’ll ever make...sometimes i feel like felix doesn’t really like his fans. he WANTS to, but he thinks we are not very smart or very kind. i could be completely wrong and i recognize that, but i just wonder and worry that if i were to ever meet him, he would think of me nothing more than an ignorant, rude, invasive, pushy fangirl, when in reality, i watch his content and support his decisions and his privacy etc. :\ and when people ask personal questions, you know? i love him so much so it makes me sad.

In 20 years pewds will be 20 years older

“It’s really messed up when people pressure you into having a baby”-the man who made Sven have a baby with his own son

Please post another video on q&amp;a

does someone knows what phone is felix using here?

The little story he told abt the picture thing made me chuckle... This video was so wholesome in some way

I am here becouse I take your videos like my listening practice. Who said that your English will be perfect for that.OK, now I got an addiction with your videos

The Gmod videos y&#39;all did with Markiplier and the others people we&#39;re my favorite when i was younger 👌🏻

It’s a trip that people aren’t used to you like this but I remember you always like this hahah

<a href="">1:30</a> well pewds people also said there would be flying cars by the year 2000

<a href="">5:49</a> wth is that on pewd&#39;s ear?

ok pay for my college?😃

I miss his personality with his old hair

What&#39;s up with his phone

Wait so does he own a house? Why does he stay at an apartment? Can anybody explain please???

Don’t let people pressure you into having kids. That’s such a personal question to put to Marzia as well. Dude you have all the money and LOVE in the world to TRAVEL and learn and EXPLORE. Take your time buddy.

I love it when he collaborates with Jack

pews we want some blooper compilation of you making videos.(old and new) People like this comment for pews to see PLEASEEEE

lol he did not answer the net worth question...

It’s none of our business where his money goes to. Such a rude question..

Is math related to science?

Pewdiepie: Gets a haircutMe: Who&#39;s that?

Is ThIs sAmSuNg GaLaXy Z fLiP !!?!?!?
Felix spent 5000 dollars on folding phone me 7 dollar PC this is fast pc

south east asia have countries with small lands and packed people, in here personal space and noise is a bit different

I like how self aware he is

Fr now felix i want to see 5kids

He is so cute I love him

&quot;make BEBE&quot;

do a day in the life vid pls!

PewDiePie: music could be a fun way to express alot off ideas and thoughtsAlso Pewdiepie: Bitch lasagna

Pewds new about 2020 💀

that video might be the most genuine video PewDiePie ever made

felix:i dont like having things around me , i find it very annoying also felix : <b>owns a stack of tambourines flex taped together</b>

The hair no beard- I miss those days...

I thought this was a genius interview

Im pretty sure in 20 years, i’ll be either dead, in jail or very succesful

wow. the worst performing video got 3.2 million views. some of us would give up everything for that kind of view.

didnt say markiplyer oof

So Japanese don&#39;t like Youtube?
Pewdiepie rocking the galaxy fold

He looks like ellie from the last of us in the thumbnail

Any one watching this in 2055?

But pewdiepie already has a bebe It edgar and maya

For me I&#39;ve had good money in the past and now I&#39;m living in a young persons hostel. Personally money is the height of my problems, yes I&#39;ve got a lot more going on but at the end of it my problems always double back to money.

I thought this was a genius video

Baby when?BABY NOWW

Hey Felix, how long have you been learning Japanese? And how often?

&quot;&quot;The Internet is the smartest and dumbest thing ever&quot;&quot;

Flexing that galaxy flip i see 😏

I love ur vids pewds
What phone does he have ?

Come to Philippines pewds cuz its so noce

The sad thing is, the &#39;get clicks&#39; formula has always been a thing. I personally know of examples of rampant &#39;hot takes&#39; and trying to shock the viewer to get the viewer to listen as old as the Titanic and the Spanish-American war to sell papers. In fact, the Spanish-American war example is why there is a phrase called &#39;Yellow Journalism&#39;.

If PewDiePie just stopped making money he wouldn’t be able to pay for tax or what ever bills for the car also gas the electricity bill and stuff like that

keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep going

This is feilx everybody not pewdiepie

If you came Viet Nam i think you maybe got in to main media

pewds: It&#39;s really fun to record with jack and ken everyone: MARKIPLIER WHAT ABOUT HIM!

The world needs more pewds and Marzia... Make BEBES

Making music is a good i idea

It really seeming he is gonna quit youtube. Lol

what kind of phone is that?

<a href="">12:19</a> Did Dodi Diana know about the pandemic???? 😆

Felix:“It’s really messed up when people pressure you into having a baby”The frick chamber:👁👄👁

I forgot about this vidéo 👁️👄👁️
I’m a simple person.I see “Felix”, “Bebe” and “when” put together in a thumbnail, I click.

I miss the chair :(

&quot;I&#39;m very into the things i like to do.&quot; Ah yes, the floor is floor here

Wait did he answer the Japan question or have I got deja vu?

Minecraft villagers wants to know your location

Where does he talk about his wedding

Pew News is the Best News

wheres bebe felix

Ok, who in their right mind has a galaxy fold?

Pewdiepie: &quot;ah, these stories! I hate them!&quot;Also Pewdiepie: &quot;so anyways, i posted one-&quot;

“She did quit YouTube to kind of leave YouTube.” Well said Pewds

“Marzia quit YouTube to leave YouTube”Hmm yes the floor here is made out of floor

<a href="">17:20</a> someone shoud make a book of just quotes that he says unintentionaly 😂

<a href="">6:10</a> damn he doesn&#39;t stop With the wisdom bombs 😅 it&#39;s like he does it spantaniously n he doesn&#39;t even know it😅

<a href="">4:36</a> damn.. that hit hard😅

When you scroll down to comments

Make some videos on bigger things

then give me the moneythanks

<b>BABY</b>    <b>WHEN?</b>

This sincere video but fully in the old pewdiepie voice would be 👌

why is your phone so wide

Galaxy Fold?! Whaaaaaaaaaat?

When you realize one of his worst performing videos has 3m views😲

Why is he so scare to have a kid?Felix:*get into his child room and ask him/her to study*Felix child:Shut up I&#39;m watching PewDiePie video

He is interested in Japan but is not a weeb, that is me with Korea, yes I enjoy kpop and drama but that is not the reason I like korea.

When are you gonna make bebe?

what phone is that??? is like two phones glued together

This is disrespecting floor gang

<a href="">11:18</a> OHLY DID I REALLY JUST HEAR  2014 PEWDS

I will say this now. I will stay here until Felix turns 65 or older, or even younger. <b>Floor gang for life</b>

Where&#39;s the baby? You mean poodieepiee?

“music could be a good medium for me to express ideas and thoughts” BITCH LASAGNA

What kind of phone does Felix have??? Like WTF

Oml you has subs like you own da world

FLOOR gAng OuH

<a href="">18:37</a> the comment says 1 second ago lol

He is literally the wisest celebrity or at least YouTubers I&#39;ve ever seen.

Hey PewDiePie! When you are coming to India?

Pewdiepie I love watching your videos and while your not family-friendly or not all original you still make your content unique and special

Thoughts on bebe :&gt;

Me after Pewds answers every question: Deep!

I really hope you get your time to process things and that you find balance in life. I figured out that that takes lots of time, and trying out different schedules. Good luck piewds

<a href="">6:07</a> I feel like he is on this path. Something about Felix&#39;s content in 2020 feels as genuine as it ever has. Floor gang represent.

He&#39;s for me such an admirable person.

God saved Pewds from Disney. God Speed Felix!

He sounds really Swedish in this video

just came back after half a year, and noticed that the video quality is actually higher than 480p

A little confused why people think that if your a married couple you automatically want kids

thank you felix, very coo,

Floor gang thereFloor gang here
ily

Please do a collab with CallMeKevin 🥺

to be honest the best thing that youtube can happen in the future to become relative u HAVE to become a unthinkable part of yt i mean u are already for the users even the ones who dont like u ... i bet my ass in the future u will become a bigger part of yt then u are alreadysry for my bad english

lol
<a href="">0:00</a> beautiful.

What about mark🥺

5 billion people watch youtube everyday so the maximum subs u can get is 5bilion(according to google)

Yo pewds nice calculator
Felix: it&#39;s really messed up when people pressure you into having kids.Also Felix: GET IN THE FRICK CHAMBER.

The day Pews quits YouTube, I’m deleting the fucking app

If pewds is my teacher in online class I would listen

&quot;living by my own ideas&quot; PewDiePie,DID YOU ALREADY FELIX?

set the video on pause and click this <a href="">1:23</a> that face lmao

I just realized that like if pewds wants to he can keep on doing youtube if it still exists for a long time. Because games will always keep on coming out and there will always be social media. This all can make more memes which pewds is the CEO of basically.

We need pewds and mark to Collab again

More q&amp;as like this game fortcraftian

The days before floor time

Yo

Now, It&#39;s the viewers asking him to quit.

Is It A Coincidence That I Watched A Ad Which A Small YouTuber Payed Some Sort Of Company...

Ah yes the classic flip phone FLEX

Pewds- &quot;I don&#39;t care about money&quot;Me- Cries in student loans

obviously you’re not perfect, but I really think you are the best possible person to be “number one” on youtube
