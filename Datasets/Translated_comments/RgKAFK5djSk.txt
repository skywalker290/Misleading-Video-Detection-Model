Hello viewers and listeners.We are Kurds living in the Middle East. The Kurdish language and culture are in danger of extinction. I want to say that all the Kurds who express this, who say that this situation is important and really painful, or rather all the Kurds who resist, are under both military and political pressure.Let the whole world know about it Please hear our voicesBecause of this issue, thousands of our friends have been imprisoned and we are afraid.

R.I.P Paul Walker. 😔

Rip paul walker :(

Hoy el chico que me gustaba ,tuvo un accidente y lamentablemente fallecio hoy 5 de marzo el dia que mas me arrepentido en la vida por no averle expresado lo que sentia por el , hoy fue el ultimo dia que lo vi en el colegio caminando con una hermosa sonrisa , solo quisiera volver el tiempo un dia antes :(Dlesroy Jama🕊♥ vuela alto mi niño🕊

2024 aqui denise borba souza❤💙

Presa no brasil com sonhos obg 🚦🚥🏝🏖💙🎭🥈🦋🍃🇧🇷🕊🙏

I’m honestly surprised at the sheer amount of people who still actively search for this video nearly a decade later. That’s very telling of Paul’s impact, this song’s impact, and the impact of the original seven F&amp;F franchise

Paul Walker the best driver of all the time with Dom

The fact that the majority of the population has seen this video

Yaut Pha, I am really missing you especially today. I really wish we will be seeing each other again. 🤍

I hate reddit

Near Death Experiences indicate that after death we basically go back to where we started prior to our birth. They’ve been recorded since ancient times, &amp; may partly be the basis for our concept of heaven. Check out the book “Life After Life” by Dr Raymond Moody, he coined the term in the 1970’s. He’s an ER doctor who started recording the experiences of his patients, the congruency is amazing.

10 billion guys come on‼️‼️‼️‼️

It’s a year since the day I miss my happiness. 2023 was the most heartbreaking year I ever had cause I lost the two most closest persons in my life who are never replaceable . But I know I’ll be okay one day and I’ll be happier more than ever. I do believe that we’ll never miss the best things in the life and do trust that best is yet to come ❤If you two ever see this msg, know that you are never alone and I’ll be praying for your happiness everyday 🫶🏻So, its been a long day without you my friend and I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again 🫂❤️‍🩹Will see how my life will be after few years ❤

March 2024 anyone??? 🎶🎧🔥😢😭🎧🔥

Anyone in 2024

Eu estou assistindo o filme 5 q ele fez no meu BRASIL!

Who watching on 2024

Каких 8 лет парни, прошло уже больше 10. 30 ноября ушел тот, на ком я рос, на ком росли другие. Своим поведением он показывал как делать не стоит за столько лет, не только от фильма форсах. Лично я научился многому у этого профессионального водилеля, каким он и был если вы не знали. Спасибо Poul, ты на всегда в моем сердце. И мой лучший актер. Мне не нужны ваши лайки засранцы, и желаю вас всем всего хорошего какими бы вы не были. Из России с любовью.P.S: Google translator.P.S.S: Sorry one more time, i`m crying every timeWhat 8 years guys, more than 10 have already passed. On November 30, the one I grew up with and the ones others grew up with passed away. With his behavior he showed what not to do for so many years, not only from the film Force. Personally, I learned a lot from this professional driver, which he was if you didn&#39;t know. Thank you Poul, you are always in my heart. And my best actor. I don’t need your likes, assholes, and I wish you all the best, no matter what you are. From Russia with love.

I just had a near death experience. This song was playing in the background. I look at it as a symbol of another chance at life. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs helping get rid of my depression. I just want everyone to know things do get better.. and they will for you too. Keep your head up. We are in this together. Life is precious. I love you..❤😊

I always get emotional when i listen to this music
