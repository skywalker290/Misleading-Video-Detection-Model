I am done Yesterday  my S20 started showing noise on display as like Old tv does when theres no picture to show.Lol

Marques has already beat gta 6

Got a s20 todayyy 220 dollars !!!
My S20 Plus just developed a thin green line on the screen (August 2023). I hope that MKHD brings this to the attention of Samsung. I bought the phone after seeing this very review. I hope there is a solution for fixing this. It seems to have happened after a recent software update.

2023. I&#39;m watching this video after I got my S20 5g recently. Not that bad. It&#39;s an amazing device. Only how much software updates did improve it. But it didn&#39;t improve enough for the camera. It&#39;s inconsistent. Dynamic range is bad in videos, even with HDR on, it only works in viewfinder but not in actual video. 8k is just there. Built quality is good, but many cases are there where the glue gets loose and back panel comes of maybe because of heat. Some rare cases where buttons also come out maybe because of wearing out. Otherwise, I just love the display, execpt where many S20+ models have many display issues, the software is amazing, full of features and customizations, though it has got some minor flaws, the speakers are also great for such small phone, cell service or reception is also good for a place where cell towers are low in count, haptics are amazing specially because you can tune the intensity, battery is also great, maybe because of the updates it got better, it lasts good enough for such small device. All in all I just love it for what I got this phone in 2023.

thanks

Please, is there a particular phone case for an S20?. My phone hangs when I put it in a phone case(pouch)

<a href="">1:14</a> super resposive, but it didn&#39;t respond
Can finally afford this phone

Got the plus version 2 years ago..unfortunately I got the green line problem on the display..got rid of it

<b>Super responsive</b>Phone: <b>Doesnt respond</b>
Now I can afford this S20 after almost 3 years of its release.

One of the worst flagship provided by Samsung

Screen resolution &amp; display on Samsung is everything.

Buy 2 lakh  value  samsung mobile nobody bother to look when you have I phone 13 pro max of 1.3 lakh  people see you with another visions. So funny

Still rocking my s20 plus in 2022. Bit weird things going backwards. In 2020 the s20 had expandable storage, 12gb ram, fast charger included, 1440p display. New s22 might have better camera and chipset but I don&#39;t find my &quot;old&quot; s20 plus that lacking. It&#39;s still fast, snappy and premium flagship experience running through the phone

Just Brought one now 2 years later and still works like a brand new Samsung s22

I wish you could see this. Lately, s20+ Exynos user experiencing so many Issues, but the biggest issue is that after updating to A12, a lot of user getting green / pink vertical line. Samsung still doesn&#39;t adress this issue and now that everyone are past warranty, they are forced to pay for replacement screen.Not only Exynos is Hot and not that fast, now its giving their user Display problem. I wish Samsung ditched Exynos for good. They&#39;ve been making this processor for years but still bad at it. There is no reason to give 2 chipset variants.

I will just buy a 100$ xiaomi

I ordered this phone today. Upgrading from a P20 Pro. The price: 4259 sek = 444 usd. Thats a reasonable price for a phone! I leaned towards the FE, but the old one seems better. Cheers!

My s7 edge is lagging while watching this

Its been a year now and I finally purchased the... S10 plus maybe a year from now I can get the S20+

s10 design is more appealing. This s20 looks old school type thing.

Truly a great phone, got mine when it came out been abusing it ever since and nothing can stop it, the battery is amazing still holds i believe 95% , screen is crystal clear, cameras are awesome, everything about this phone is just great

Take that iPhone so what if they skipped iPhone 9 we skipped s11 to 19

why you don&#39;t make 60fps videos?

Just got my S20+ today, phenomenal phone.

I love it but I can&#39;t afford any Samsung flagship phones

S20 disply prices in India?

So, I bought the s20+ 5G last year and love it! I bought the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 this year and love it too. I got the Lte one, but the one downside is it&#39;s 4G. It works just fine with my 5G s20+, but I think Samsung could have made the watch 5G!

I had a flickering screen lately. I have used this Samsung Galaxy S20 since March 2020. Haven&#39;t made up my mind about whether to change the LCD or buy a new handphone. shitty phone

Crap phone flickering issues

Image security protection, everyone's wish! Then get your Galaxy S20. Really different image! There is no comparison! Unless with a Galaxy S20!
what type of hairs are those ?

Price please

“Could’ve called it galaxy zoom”No that’s reserved for the Note 30 where they just stuff a whole telescope in there

Love your shirt bro, where&#39;d you get??

I found a sealed s20 for sale for 650$, my only gripe is no headphone jack.

Ugliest flagship
@marques brownleeFrom India🇮🇳,Can u send me this phone(s20) for my studies..Coz, my currently using phone has outd ated, broken and Hard to use..   consider  me sir .

Watching on my iphone 12 pro

So anyone buying an s21 in 2021 is insane. S20 is better in almost every spec

i dont play any games on phone but i rly like s20 design .. but im in EU .. so i dont know with regular user how long the battery life its now .. can it go at 5h on screen time ? .. with like youtube twitch insta snap .. stuff like this

Is it durable tho

&#39;<a href="">2:48</a>&#39;  Ok that is the best: *𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐍𝐀𝐍𝐀.𝐂𝐎𝐌*; ️ disregard others they&#39;re BS 

&#39;03:67&#39;  Better head directly to <b>-M O D N A N A-()</b> ...  should you know you really need it! 

My s8 plus is still the beast. Ultimate curvy sharp bright display. And the looks built quality is still the best

This S20 have 8ram not 12ram

GL

120hz display is awesome.

I would never pay for the latest flagship. Personally.

Hi bro Ur from manhattan

But why the battery is low

Now that I think of it, whose legs are those? <a href="">0:03</a>Marques gotta twin?

the phone looks small in his hand xDDD

I am very happy with my cell phone it works perfectly 
Excellent, its battery lasts 4000mAh and charges quickly, its excellent camera, mega pixels, I love Samsung
Perfect for my needs, no problems with the cell phone and I'm already having it for a year
Very bad, the fingerprint was damaged and I don't know why.
Super

...I &#39;ll wait another 2 years. I&#39;m not really getting anything new as I have my S10+ 5G 256GB, which pretty much has everything the S20 has. The phone speeds on my old phone still is good (after 2 years) and the storage and camera quality is still up to par.

Ill buy thisMy phone is a j7It cant even run facebook now it keeps crashing and overheating

I see it.

I like it.

I want it.

I check the price.

I can&#39;t afford it. :(
This is samsung galaxi s20 is Dad

How price in usa ?

<a href="">2:26</a> my phone came at 1080p/60hz  maybe it&#39;s a T-Mobile thing though

Dear Sir &quot;Please let me know Samsung S 20 supported ESIM?

After 1 year finally I am buying the plus for 500 Bucks .

Watching this on my new galaxy s20 plus, so far this phone is amazing!! Camera, performance, software, etc. Great review

S20 S10 iPhone X iphone 7 are the only good looking phones

which is better iphone se or samsung s20 in terms realibilty

worst phone ever !! The battery is a disaster of S20+, I charge daily 3 times, I don&#39;t recommend, don&#39;t buy this thrash, stupid samsung.

Yessss now I can get the Galaxy S2 omg I am soo excited

Don&#39;t have the luxury of the s20 but I&#39;m currently using the cheaper S20FE5G and loving it. If I could change one thing about it, I would increase the battery life. The S20 looks really slick (damn near the same minus glass and subtle camera difference). Oh and missing 8k? Hardly. I don&#39;t even shoot in 4k. I prefer good old 1080p@60fps. Looks great and saves space.

Can that phone overheat while playing games.

I&#39;ve upgraded from the G8 to the S20 and in a few ways I consider it to be a downgrade. My biggest issues with the S20 are:1. Face unlock on the G8 is far superior compared to the S20. Seeing that the G8 has dedicated sensors, It&#39;s more secure, accurate, and works better in low light.2. The optical finger print scanner on the S20 is cool but just not as accurate as the traditional scanner on the G8. I also prefer the placement on the G8.3. No option to disable the camera shutter sound on the S20 (atleast for the variant I got)

I distance get the fucking snapdragon 865

1 year anniversary

s20 plus or iphone 11?

Anyone know where I can download the stock wallpaper as seen in video, where the background is light purple? All the ones downloadable from internet have light grey background

I&#39;m looking at this with my S20

Tells super responsive and the screen doesn&#39;t mover<a href="">1:11</a>. This phone looks damn slick.

god i want to change my j5 pro to this phone but im broke BROKE

lol. I do want the new Samsung Galaxy 20 or 20+ but not at $1000+ I have an S8 that&#39;s still in great condition

I was scammed many times untill I met slide_cracks on IG he helped me unlock my phone phone from iCloud

This is good time to purchase s20 + pls comment

s20 review first, before proceeding to s20 ultra. Marques&#39; orders.

S20 be like: where is my most improved phone award.

It&#39;s now 600$ 300 bucks less
Who&#39;s watching this after the S21 release

Am I right that he has a white s20?

for s20 u get to choose between higher resolution vs higher refresh rate. for a non-gamer what u think is the best - opt 1080p with 120 hz / quad hd with 60hz

Is it worth me switching from my iPhone 8 to this ? I love my galaxy’s

Watching on my s9 after s7 upgrade this month. S20 in 2years from now i guess ;) used for 150e we roll

\\\Fkhkhkhkhkhghhhhh'-kk
I need help, should I get a new i phone 11 or a new Samsung S 20?

I was going to buy a s10+ then saw this.

I got my Samsung S10 tracked back today... thanks to WAYNE_PURPLE on Instagram

Imagine Samsung devices with Apple processors 

I upgraded from an S7 to an S20. I have not looked back, I was pretty tied to my S7 and refusing to let it go. The S20 is beautiful and so many cool features my old phone no longer had.

The best

Amazing!!
Galaxy S21:New Year, new Samsung.
Samsung is 
I would have gotten this if it wasn’t for one ui, I detest it. I know you can install a different launcher but I’ve had bad experiences with this and it’s too much hassle. Welp

HDR+ and that resolution are a shit. The great majority have weak eyes. In any domain the producers introduce too expensive products which offer features that are almost or entirely useless. I call this a pus.And that thing with ... sixty cameras when is needed one.

How are the notifications on the S20? I am finding a delay on Huawei android devices with their notifications. Everything is turned on. So is it the same with Samsung?

I got the note 10 plus 5g, beautiful phone as well as flawless

Yeah well battery in Europe lul

Is the Galaxy s20+ worth the extra money?

These look normal in Marques &#39; hands, this means it will be like an ipad in our hands

Hey MKBHD,In Asia we dont have s20 with snapgragon chipset &amp; adreno gpu.Can you pls send me of that model( used by you also accepted )to me.I am watching ur videos always related to mobile phones.Pls contact me +94763920472

Lol 9.8mbps I got 20mbps+ with 4g in rural area of INDIA

I have one
we get it you got jordan 1s

Who is watching  this  on S 20.

I just bought a Samsung Galaxy S20 5G version  &lt;3

Got the s20 now at 45%off :)

Decode yo
What is the screen size ? Battery life ?

I upgraded from s8 to s20 and the main changes I recognised were: 1)underdisplay fingerprint sensor2)MUCH better battery3)120Hz Refresh Rate(Its amazing)4) Ultrawide, telephoto camera and night mode(they are so useful)5)Feels like you got no besels6)Much faster7)Much better speakers

he even got himself a professional juggler for this video <a href="">8:33</a>

Who is here after buying it on big billion days/ Samsung Diwali Sale

Does your s20+ heats up while you&#39;re using it for like less than 10mins? Because mine does, idk why and my phone is just one day old and I was just using YouTube.

2x 64MP telephoto

you like samsung me like samsung
I wonder, who&#39;s that beautiful girl?

ton of useless features

You probably already realise this by now, but the S20 is not 120Hz Quad HD. It&#39;s either 60Hz Quad HD or 120Hz Full HD.

Am I the only person thats mad about the missing headphone jack......I love having my headphone jack... and i use it often just because airpods die and get lost easy.

The s20 is what I wished the s10 would be

I get 20 Mbps on my phone in India......Hmm and we don&#39;t even have 5G rolled out by anyone yet....

Finally, A Smartphone Without A Square Notch!

why don&#39;t samsung just increase the fhd+ to get more ppi as far as the resolution can go ?!!

beware if you get it from verizon, their version doesn&#39;t have a micro sd slot. its to late for me because i didn&#39;t want to pay the $45 service fee to return and get unlocked but its not to late for you

the Pixel 5 has a larger battery in a smaller body then the s20, plus a smaller screen and 90hz, so it&#39;s gonna have a killer battery life

Listen man. you make great videos. I cannot find another place that combine an in-depth review along with a touch of personal opinion that makes me feel like a more informed consumer. I do, however, have to give you a reprimand for not mentioning that the tube amp pro feature is gone :/ Cheers!

This is it. The video that jinxed 2020.

Samsung is a cheating company who updates &amp; destroys their devices to force consumers to buy new ones. Worldwide they have destroyed thousand of galaxy note 9 by this and other devices as well but they dont bother to apologize. Go to hell Samsung

Got mine s20 for $399 through boost mobile promo codes

<a href="">0:53</a> Love this moment

Hello marcus,i watch every video you make, i watched this video also and brought galaxy s20, this phone has very bad battery life and overheating issues. Marcus you did not tell this thing in the video , halo out negative things, now i m stuck, lost money. So plz now stop making brand sponsored video. 

One thing I like about MKBHD is he consistently maintains the brand identity in his studio. No RGB lighting or Nanoleaf on the wall.  Good to see!

Love this video

Alright so 1 thing you brought up the 5g isnt as gamebreaking as some people think it is no mabye ,ot but the only way to get the 12gb of ram on the normal s20 is to get the 5g version just something that should of been pointed out lol the others of course don&#39;t have to be but yeah all good great video as always

this phone is garbage

Hi im from the Philippines and I bought samsung s20 plus ( Exynos) processor here, Ill be back in the U.S this December can I trade my S20 plus Exynos to Snapdragon 885? 

Hmm a lot of things changed in 2020 from feb to oct

this phone is 649$ in india......

I currently have a s10 and I loved the curved edges. I don&#39;t why they went to a flatter display but oh well it is still slightly curved and the bezels are non existent unlike the iphone that has relatively huge bezels and a giant notch.

watching this on my s20

Watching this on S20 plus and it&#39;s great

Incredible Smartphone!!

Can I just say that the 120hz is fuckingg smoothhh

I lost a S9 last year,I&#39;m now using a J6+ an I&#39;m getting a S20 next year 🇯🇲

My phone network problem 1  sim use dialog network when I dial call always call decline some time can call but auto stopping call I think this phone get poor network signal can i know what is the solution for it????????

You should talk about Exynos more, I was very mislead by this review.

because Kim taehyung i am here 
I upgrade when S30 comes out. :)

I would like to see Samsung go back to the removable Battery because if your battery starts dying its a pain to have a new one put in!!

Forget the smartphone, how to get one of those Minnesota Grey Duck T-shirts?

I couldn&#39;t not understand why you guys YouTuber do not  criticize to i phone .... As criticize to other smart phons..I phone is nothing as good as he charged

No thanks I like my galaxy 3  simple to use  and all I need its to make a call all others features it&#39;s bullshit.  Remember people ask yourselves  do you really need it   need vs want

Samsung fan boys: apple releases phones WAYYYY to fastApple people: doesn&#39;t Samsung release a new phone like every 6 monthsSamsung fan boys: .......... Samsungs betterApple people: lies

Eff after all these years my s7 screen cracked...guess it&#39;s a sign to upgrade.

what&#39;s an asterisk ?

Giveway.....bro

please Samsung, get the fuck rid of Bixby and your own trash cloud services.

Is that curve?

I wonder, what phone at s20 lineup replaces s10e... 

why do all these youtubers just ignore the s10 lite?

Please review charging speed while using fast wireless charging and wired headset at same time on S20+

Price?

Watching this on the I phone Xs...... I have to admit that Samsung is light years ahead of Apple.

Samsung=We have made something new.Oneplus=Laughing and goes back to sleep.

I’ve  got the S20, S20 Ultra and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The battery for my S20 is very weak as it can’t last me a day. Half a day it would be at 30% but the S20 Ultra can last me for the whole day. But overall my favourite phone is my iPhone 11 Pro Max. The battery is super lasting thought! Much better than my S20 Ultra. To me battery in a phone is very important as I need it to last me a whole day through. I need to call my clients and sometimes I need to use the GPS to drive to certain places to meet up with my clients though. GPS consume lots of battery power so whenever I bought a mobile phone, Ali expect the battery to last me at least a day. I don’t play mobile games or watch streaming videos. I use my mobile mostly on work only. But all 3 phones are awesome.....

This guy broke the 4th wall in the 4th wall

I’ve got two choices for phones, iPhone 6 or galaxy S5

I hate that the Exynos version of the S20 also only has 8 GB RAM

Now i can afford the s4

It&#39;s funny to watch this on an s20+ lol

Im sorry but s20 ram is 8gb not 12 ,s20+ is 12ram

Android is just disappointing.Always been a fan of customization freedom of android.So Switched to Samsung flagship this year. Big mistake! Top of the line hardware pieces put together.  BUT it feels like they don&#39;t to each other. There is always a stutter.. a glitch here and there, no matter what how high specs are. Exynos 990 is simply inferior. And this  partiality is criminal.If u poke it long enough, it heats up like a burning coal. Even if u play with the camera long enough it looses it. Frames start dropping. Refresh rate is scaled down to 60hz automatically. It&#39;s garbage sold at a premium.

Europe: <b>cries in Exynos 990</b>

Cant wait to see some nice new clear  quality homemade videos on Redtube

My voice is really  close to yours because my bixby started when you said bixby

And here i am still with my s6... got it when it first launched, it was one of the best phones back in the day, now thinking about getting an s20...

how much it sells
Samsung  20 plus Supports 5g ????
Just got this peice from neon beach

SAMSUNG BECAUSE YOU GIVE THE REST OF THE WORLD YOUR EXYNOS 990 IN S20 LINE IT MAKES YOUR SALES JUST A HALF.... JUST GIVE SD 865 AND IT WILL BE DOUBLE ON SALES , ITS OK FOR UPPING PRICE IN 10-15% BUT WE DONT NEED TO BURN OUR HAND BECAUSE OF THE  FUCKIN HEAT EXYNOS, ASK PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD  SHAME ON U SAMSUNG ....

Samsung is so much better than the iphone, they just need to improve their camera more

sup

Hi buddy,I have some issues with my s20 plus which also mentioned on samsung community.<b>*</b>Hi,I am using S20+ 4G exynos varient and 15W wireless charger stand. (without phone case)Please refer below stats.,Stat 1 -My phone to charge from 75% to 100%, the estimated time 55 minutes but it took 1 hour and 52 minutes to charge it from 75% to 85%.Stat 2 -Again on phone estimated 35 minutes to charge it from 75% to 100% but within 35 minutes it charged only upto 79%.Phone showing that it is enabled &quot;fast wireless charging&quot; but  that not the case.Also when i pluged in samsung AKG headset or any other type c item while it on wireless charging, the charging method is changed to normal wirless charging. Why??Ps: I have tested 4 years old S7 edge exynos varient for above charging stats and it is charging fine by wireless charging. Fully charged by the estimated time. With using a 3rd party phone case.Why S20 series have failed on basic functions.Thanks

You need your titles to be specific

I changed my iPhone 11 for the S20 best decision ever

When can I have a flagship phone again that is a phone not a camera?

Too many bugs...

I’m trying to figure out if I should finally upgrade from my s8 since I’ve had it since launch. But idk if I want one of the s20s or the Note 10.

Thank you for making this video and helping me decide which smasung phone to get next also thank you for helping me decide which Samsung Galaxy S series to get for the 1st time after a horrible experience with a lower grade Samsung phone.

Skipping numbers is well and good. The phone needs to have substance. Just upgrading the screen is not worth it. My phone is barely 3 months old and the battery seems to have given up (yes, I am aware of deep sleep for apps, 60 Hz display etc etc). I still love the screen but the speaker sound quality has taken a noticeable dip and multiple trips to the Service Center have not been helpful. This is when my phone is under warranty. Really awful.

So i can watch porn on 8k now!! Shitttt

Just got this today as an upgrade for my S10e and I will own this for a couple of years.

why is that 60hz refresh rate on s20 is so bad compare to (let say) iphone 7.. i guess that is one of the reason why 120hz on s20 looks good..

Should I buy it or i go for s20 ultra

Samsung stock icons are so ugly I don’t know why they still haven’t revamped them

iPhone 11 or Samsung s20+.......please can somebody help me to choose ......please give ur honest opinions

Which one can I buy s20 plus or s20 ultra. Money is not issue . But I need best camera captures images

As Indians, we get highly overrated cheap Exynos with less RAM!

What happened to the edge?!!

I really want to know which theme,wallpaper is he using

I&#39;m wondering which theme is he using

Well,  I guess I&#39;m 15 models behind because I still have the s5

Cant believe u missed these ppl... S20+ does have milimeter wave.

Where I live, the 5G version isn&#39;t even available, so also no 12GB of ram and it has the bad exynos processor. Also no headphone jack and the hideous design makes it looks just like the midragnge/budget phones. I wanted to get the S10, but Samsung currently has a sale which makes the s20 pretty much the same price as the s10, so it would be a shame to pass out on that. I really hope they stop putting worse chipsets in the phones in some parts of the world than the others and that they make the s series design better and more distinguishable

Just got one,now my phone has more ram than my laptop

Never heard marques appreciate Samsung as whole

Unless you get the SD variant then you are just wasting money.

Who is that blonde lady? She is cute

I&#39;ve heard there have been problems with the camera on this phone.  Is this true?

Is this guy considered an expert?

Good review. I watched another one you did with your mate too. In on S9 right now. Think I&#39;ll go S20. The plus looks a bit to big. I ride motorcycles and the phone needs to fit in my inside pocket.

The thing left is to return back to the normal inches around 5 max 6in. These gigantic things are just not comfortable.And I&#39;m still on Huawei P8 Lite from 2016. The only minus is the already noticeable bad quality camera compared to now (back then it was top notch), and the battery life which dies in 2-3 hours.

Apple: skip 9 Samsung: skips 9 Apple: no, I meant skip 9 not SKIP 9.
I had an iPhone X and couldn&#39;t stand watching samsung videos because I was missing out on so much, I got a note and now I can watch these videos lol

Dude, just read Grey D*ck  in your shirt lol

Ok maybe some you tech nerds can help me out. I got this phone about 2 weeks ago and have had nothing but problems. I have sprint and I live in Daytona Florida. When I&#39;m at work it say I have 5G (don&#39;t know if it&#39;s real 5G but it shows the 5G icon in the top right) when I&#39;m on 5G nothing works. It&#39;s slower than 3G was. Texts don&#39;t send, calls won&#39;t go through. I can&#39;t send or receive emails websites just spin and spin. Its useless. But When I&#39;m on 4G LTE everything works fine. Sprint is no help just keep giving me the run-a-round. I&#39;m ready to just send it back and go back to my s9 that ran fine. You spend $1000 on a phone you expect it to work.

CORRECTION: I contacted Samsung for the 5G, only the s20 doesnt have Mmwave 5G the s20+ and s20 Ultra do support the Mmwave and sub-6

Galaxy s20 is my dream phone

Awful phone after two weeks browser froze 3 times miss my HTC samsung is a joke

I have phone since 2015

I have a question guys.I don&#39;t know which one to buy. Samsung s10+ or s20?

WOOOOOW the S20+ is awesome I had it 

Sorry but the battery on s20 plus is shit.running 120Hz drains the battery like hell.

You guys. I just ordered the Galaxy s20 plus and the front facing camera is absolutely the worst. The WORST. IT SUUUCKS. There is absolutely no details when you zoom in, and it looks so digitalized. Video sucks too! Rear camera is OK, but the zoom digitalize everything as well. I just want a natural looking photo! I can&#39;t take any selfies with this phone because it makes me look so ugly. I have to go back to my broken galaxy s8 for better quality selfies. Samsung better fix this because this is unacceptable for this price. If not, I&#39;m giving it up and may look to switch for the first time to an iPhone. Be careful spending your money!!

I had the option to get this phone or the S10E. I chose the S10E. I&#39;m not spending 1000 bucks on a phone.

I have the s7 with the curve and at first it&#39;s nice and cool but after 3 years it gets annoying.

Tbh I keep forgetting this one

Finally I can afford the Galaxy SII

how much you bye it?

Sumsung&gt;apple
Is the S20 worth paying £43 for 30GB of data?

Why this one so heat when it use

Hi please send me one phone

4000/4500mah is so unimpressive

Overpriced, A serie is the best

Hey marques please publish a video on samsung s20+ and share your using experience.

What about the speaker quality though? One review said it sounds tinny.

Berazzzzer hawaruuu beraaazzzeru r my black beraaaazzzzer ferrry good ferrry nice my berazzzzzer! african berazzzer We are all berrraaazzzzeeerrrrrrS
Hey Marques! Can you make a video about the ads experience on iOS vs Android (One Plus, Samsung, Xiaomi) ?

are both models waterproof ????

first of all , make a video on &quot;how to be rich to buy every smartphone&quot;

You forgot to mention the headphone jack.  But other then that  video looks good.

A g-whizz &amp; a half for the Ultra? Wow-we, that&#39;s a whole lot of bananas? That&#39;s more than my stimulating , yikes! Well, if I were to upgrade my S10+ it would be the base model. I luv the form factor at 6.2. And the 120hz display with 12gigs of ram? Better &#39;s are very nice. Their displays are simply the best, for me anyway! Great review....

Super responsiveDoesn&#39;t respond
The samsung official site sent me here for review.. wow i guess that is the perk for youtubers

there should have been 4g version

Samsung cheated us in S20 and S20+ in the name of telephoto lens by providing only digital crop of a 64MP wide angle lens. Being at the top most position in smartphone market this is not expected. There is no difference left between best android smartphone company and petty Chinese brands. Though this was first upgrade in terms of main camera sensor since S7, for poor image processing samsung failed to deliver better camera performance than previous year models. Lack of competition in flagship market puts stop on smartphone innovation, companies spending money only on fake marketing ( 48MP quad camera with actual 48 + 8 + 2 + 2 cameras).Smartphone market has been worst for last may be 3-4 years.With brands like SONY(Xperia arc,S),HTC(One M7,U11),LG (G2,G4) gone, only competition huwaei is also finished with google situation.

Think this should lead to a future with low budget phones in android made by likes of oppo , vivo , mi, oneplus (strictly prohibited for photography with only available color filter camera :P), samsung and flagship iphones.

Likes of iphone SE 2020 may capture mid tier.

More painful thing is the reviewing industry with millions of review channels are just promoting the fake marketing policies with no real reviewer left like Erica.

Can i get one
Got it for free with Sprint its actually pretty great at least to me.

I like this phone but let&#39;s be honest the s10 is much nicer looking phone

So the base S20 costs the same as the base iPhone 11 Pro?

Me:very niceMarques:do you like itMe:yes,I doMarques:OK good then,I&#39;ll get one for youMe:thank you

Still icons/theme is as shitty as before 

How stupid u have to be to buy this phone XD lmao samsung love idiots XDDD

Curved display is a problem for some people, i don&#39;t want it too. Great move with this phone, ill get it

Marques Brownlee,Are you sure about the subpar 5G?  I know the S10 5G has the lower standard but the international version (865)  of the S20 has the higher standard.  I&#39;m in China and just got the HK version.  Using the 5G here, it is significantly faster than 4G.  I&#39;d double check your data.

I came here from the one plus 8 pro review and am shocked that you knocked the one plus 8 pro for the camera bump but not the s20. The s20 camera bump is way worse.

Did Samsung remove the 3.5 mm port socket to divert from the fiasco of making the S20&#39;s camera inferior to the S10 Note&#39;s camera?When in a hole - stop digging - but it appears that Samsung tried to cover-up their gross negligence by using a vast amount of money on marketing - Instead of solving the S20 Ultra&#39;s Cameras&#39; problems. It appears that Samsung didn&#39;t manufacture enough Black S20 512 GB  phones even before the coronavirusSupplying White earbuds+ phones instead of black ones is another blunder, really stupid mistake, made by Samsung.Who wants white  earbuds+ that doesn&#39;t complement expensive; grey and black S20 Ultra smartphones?

<a href="">4:30</a> Only the S20 works for the 5G sub 6.But the; S20+ and the S20 Ultra both should be compatible with mmWave - probably told by Samsung UK before the lockdown in England, UK.

So is this where we are headed now, $1000 phone? That&#39;s a bit much. I have an s7 right now and I&#39;ve been happy with it but I noticed a couple black dots on it. I think the led under the display messed up from a drop so I know I&#39;m gonna need a new phone soon. I could get the S10 but it feels like weird to purchase a new phone and be behind a year. I know first world problems. And yes I know I&#39;m behind 3yrs at the moment lol. Damn im gonna think about this one.

Is it a big upgrade from a OP5?:) it&#39;s either S20 or Iphone, having a hard time deciding:)

Hey marques why don’t u make a video on s20 plus I really wanna know the difference between s20 plus and s20 ultra

which phone is your favourite android phone?

dudes thumb is so flat lol, looks like a beaver tail

Why is there bairly anyone mention that you CAN NOT play games in 120 fps? -.-

I&#39;m fucking hate Huawei. It&#39;s just Samsung&#39;s fake.
The s20+ does do uwb mmw 5g

DONT BUY THE S20,! I have the s20 now. Im coming from the s10. Worst &quot;upgrade&quot; ever. Battery life on the s10 was better. S10 had a headphone jack. And i swear the s10 was faster. The s20 has a 20:9 ratio and the s10 19;9, so the s20 is horrible watching youtube. It is so narrow you cant type! S10 has a Better camera setup and looked overall Better imo. Only advantage the s20 has is the 120hz screen but if you use that im having a 3 hour screen on time. Had every galaxy S Phone from the s3. This is the last time i swear. Gonna sell this one and buy the OnePlus 8. Horrible job by Samsung

<a href="">1:13</a> &quot;Super responsive&quot;<b>Doesn&#39;t respond to swipe</b>

The whole time I was just reading salty comments instead of watching...

Huawei  mate 9 still  better than all these new phones

FACT : if you rub the S20 Ultra , four times really hard it expands to the Samsung Wall MicroLED TV a whopping 292 inches !

I want one of those

Fucking fanboy. This is not a $1500 piece of tech. Period.

ft

Audio! Audio! Audio!

iPhone: our phone is ugly..Samsung:Hold my camera

Why does this video let me use 1440p on s6?

Can anybody tell me type of may be the led clock? it is <a href="">2:28</a> in the indistinct left background. THX

I just got my new Galaxy Note 9 and I don&#39;t regret buying it at ALL. I LOVE THE S-PEN!

It&#39;s interesting you say that 5G would only be 20% faster than 4G, when I tested it on my S20+, I was getting speeds more than twice as fast as 4G (350Mbps down, compared to 165Mbps on 4G). Did the specs change after you posted this video?

The real question is whether its better than the 7 pro

Is this phone having heating problem

My s10+ is working really swell. Still blazing fast even after a year of heavy use. I usually upgrade every year but not this time? The 60hz display is just fine, camera &amp; battery work just fine. To me these are just incremental upgrades. Sure the 120hz display is great but takes a toll on the battery? Nah, I enjoy my s10+ way too much!

Lol, Where&#39;re Them iSheep At Just Kidding Or Maybe &quot;I&#39;M NOT&quot; 
So I&#39;m the only one is still on j1 ... sad I don&#39;t have money

Does it have video stabilization?

Samsung as always been better for developers,  but this yr they&#39;ve made it so clear that there league&#39;s ahead of ios

btw s20+ does have mm wave. Din&#39;t expect this from you Marques

This is what an upgrade is supposed to be like! Take notes apple

Amazing
I like the PRO camera but I don&#39;t like a thing

The pink color is dope.

I just got the s20 and I have to admit the 5g is fantastic and noticeable. I was surprised but I&#39;m in love with the phone.

I know time is marching on, but this is ridiculous. I missed the 11-19 versions. Lol

I like iPhones but i don’t hate on Samsung just wanted to see what’s going on with Samsung phones

S20 Ultra itself falls shortThese re camera phonesAnd for a phone , the S10 Plus is plenty phone until Real cameras with real zoom capability appear on Samsung phones

S20+ could do mmWaves right?

Soon, the entire rear of a phone is going to be filled with cameras

Galaxy S20+ review please. Been waiting for that.

Which keyboard is he using? is it wireless? ( I know it&#39;s mechanical...)

Does anyone know if this phone runs on 4g as well as we dont have 5g yet

Every day When I return back from school, I use to look at a GALAXY store Situated at the left side Of my elbow, just looking at those beautiful S20 phones just makes my mouth sweat in saliva!

Who else watching this on s20 ‍️

the girl juggles marques&#39;s balls well

gone are the days when apple was the more expensive phone. $999

Where do you get the white one?

Had a S9 since 2018, phone has been crashing since last week. Just ordered the S20 Cosmic Grey.

I like this phone. I hate the price

yeah, but will it blow up?

Watching on s20 now

I just canceled my s20+ 5G due to stronger frequencies. Any phones that have 5G causes cancer. I&#39;ll stick with 4G for now even though it&#39;s still harmful, but lesser than 5G.

I like humble marques is. He can literally wipe his ass with a Galaxy ultra but he doesn&#39;t brag on it

I preordered the Samsung Ultra 5G through T-mobile. After having it for almost a week I have to say that I&#39;m honestly underwhelmed by the camera&#39;s performance (primarily the camera software).Having kept with my Galaxy S8 for a few years, I decided that I was ready to finally upgrade and buy the most premium Galaxy option. Though the quality of the images are great, I am unable to capture most of them due to the camera&#39;s autofocus constantly readjusting itself and leaving most of my images blurry. Also, on rare occasions when I take multiple shots, I will receive a message that the camera has crashed which results in the app closing and me losing a few of the images. With the camera being one of the major selling points of the device, I feel a little disappointed and upset about this $1400 purchase.

Being a software junky, I would have liked to see what&#39;s up with One UI. It&#39;s the main reason—aside from $—I still don&#39;t buy Samsung devices.

LOL, DIETSCHY.

The fingerprint scanner, can you still not use it with screen/glass protectors?

Watching this on my S20 from Best Buy. Worth the upgrade from S10 and esp. the trade-in amount plus samsung credit.

SAMSUNG galaxy s20 
I dont need  a fast refresh rate for a screen i just need a phone with less shit on it like bloatware shite.. i&#39;ve been tempted by apple and their ios just because i dont need android features other than the gmail thing which i dont read when im out anyway and 9/10 times i do that on the pc its very rare i ever click it. I just browse amazon and tinder now and then

What people don&#39;t know is that the more megapixels a sensor has, the more noise and grain is introduced into a photo. I think that&#39;s why 12mp is a good sweetspot because you get nice sharp images that you definitely are going to print. You need high mp for printing sharp images.

Hey Marques what&#39;s better in your opinion iPhone 11 pro or Samsung S20+ your opinion gonna really help me.Expecting reply from you.

So what is your fave android phone Mr Brownlee, do tell? Lets see how it stacks up against the S20

When is the full review for S20 and S20+ coming up??

The price on these flagships have jumped the shark

Anyone else having trouble with their sim card and memory card disconnecting with their Samsung phone over and over, basically making your phone unusable. Had to move my sim card back to my s5 because the constant disconnecting kept on interrupting everything.Any fixes for it? That tray solution doesn&#39;t seem to work that well...

Me: Looking at my note 9 Note 9: Don&#39;t look at me like that

I have a note 9 worth buying s20 + ?

Would you recommend this over the s10+?

Tomorrow going to get it s20 cosmic gray my first and last flagship phone

Very proud of Samsung to get rid of the Bixby button

Fucking hate the Bixby button.  So useless, glad its gone.

Love your microphone! Crystal clear!
This was a great review that helped me make up my mind in picking up these phones

I’m so tired of the iPhone and am so tempted to get this phone but since I’m so accustomed to their OS,  since it’s so simple to use, I’m hesitant.   Helppppppp..!!

are there crazy slow motion capabilities

@mkbhd. You mentioned 12gb ram in this video. Where as I saw 8gb ram mentioned in Flipkart (e-commerce website in India). Is the US model and Indian model different from each other?

Intro Music Name Please?

Great video . If i get one if these phones in July on my birthday it&#39;s definitely going to be the S20 ultra.

What the fuck with this colors toys r us  colors

wowwwww

Marques - I know you probably don&#39;t read these comments, especially after a few weeks, but you are WRONG on one of your specs. The S20 Ultra AND the S20 Plus both use sub6 + mmWave 5G bands. Only the base S20 version doesn&#39;t use the mmWave band. This is an important point for those of us waiting for the T-Mobile and Sprint merger to go live in a few months. Sprint uses the sub6 and T-Mobile uses the mmWave. Put them both together, and you have a much better experience.

I&#39;m asking everyone that&#39;s making a video for the s20 is it vr compatible!? It&#39;s amazing you talk about everything......!!!! About the BUT IS IT STILL VR COMPATIBLE!?????? LOL

How is this man so black and so white at the same time.

samsung really didnt call it galaxy zoom, biggest miss of all time.

I&#39;m not a big fan of taking photos and selfies but 20+ enough for me

@Marques Brownlee, the phones have 8GB RAM and not 12GB.

So as usual great videos. But I think that 120Hz 1080p is awesome. What about a 90Hz 1440p. And also as u said 120Hz 1440p. A 90Hz at max resolution would be amazing because it gives u I guess, the best of both worlds combined. What do u think?

Anyone know if the North America s20 models will have esim support?

Is it just me or the colour coding in this video is a little off.

Fam what camera do you use to get your videos?

Why no 256gb option and 512gb option on the S20

Samsung&#39;s known for the super curves

What I miss is the 1tb internal storage option and the dual selfie cameras

Great video bro

I honestly really like s20 because it is compact .. same as s10e

there are some companies just raising up the price the is no innovation

Ain&#39;t nobody got money for that!

But still no headphone jack...

Yes- everything is like u said, BUT..just like every Samsung it will slow down plus it will get laggy and not even in longer period- so check out how it performs after a year and then make another review.Its also so bad( but we all got use to it) that even 12 and even 16 gb of ram didnt help Samsung to beat 4 gb ram on latest Iphones- again, with  just 4gb ram Iphone still has higher antutu score( last year Iphones)- than again Sony Xperia 1- 2 and Xiaomi Mi 10 have higher scores than Iphones( but thats usual in past years, waiting for new OnePlus 8 Pro)

Prices r All close range, might as well cop the ultra

Hi, I am curious, there’s youtubers out there literally campaigning to advertise Oled shimmering on mobile phones damaging our eyes and yet none of you mayor youtubers are reporting it. Why ?

I&#39;m here because future you told me to watch this video first.

Marques when a i phone starts from more than 1grand, it&#39;s still buyable with reference to the class of the phone.Marques when Samsung launch a phone with a lil more price but the most epic camera ever&quot;We don&#39;t have a grand and a half&quot;

According to the Samsung website S20+ and Ultra have the same 5G : Sub6 and mm Wave 5G. The s20 only has sub 6.

They are gonna cost half the price in about 10 Months

I really hoped they would release something similar to the S10e

5 g cells this came out in my area they are Galaxy S20  $999.99 Unlocked Galaxy S20+ 1,099.99 UnlockedGalaxy S20 Ultra 1,299.99 Unlocked .l know 5g cells would be 50 times more money to get it would be hard like me to get a 5 g cell  hopefully more will come out that are less money

Wow literally just bought the s10

Will we get 1440P @ 90hz?
Yay!  No more curved edge!

Marques in your opinion what is the best android phone right now on the market ?

Watching from my S7. 

India currency bro
Which cost bro

Should i go for s20 or s20+ ?. I am not really concerned about big screen, my main concerns are camera and Battery life.

And they STILL have shitty icons! Bring back the icons from the S4!

That S20+ is quite big but still look Small in your Hands man lol

Would the 8k be suitable for recording a concert? Can’t help noticing all my phones lack in this department.

Thats why samsung is better than iphones

what is your favourite android phone?

Anyone know how to buy a Samsung phone with the built-in phone call recorder enabled? They don&#39;t sell them here in Canada. At this price it&#39;s non-negotiable.

Never thought I&#39;d feel poor from owning a phone limited to 60hz

Still going strong with my s9 maybe upgrade at the end of the year

Soon Samsung mobile design will be the same with Iphones...the camera says it all...haha

I hope this means a price reduction on note10 for me.

If you heard the Arabic translation
Think I&#39;ll wait for the S21 hopefully for improved 5G technology

headphone jack? coz sony put the headphone jack back in their new xperia.

Phones are getting taller... it&#39;s getting ugly

Apple: Our New IPhone Has 3 Cameras!Samsung: <b>We Got 4</b>
So we went from S10 to S20? Damn Samsung.

One of the only big youtubers who made a video and the other 2 not just ultra monster. Thanks marques!

Getting the s20 in cloud pink 

Hey Marques, what do you use to edit videos ?

Preordered mine and got free galaxy buds + 

1080p is all you need on a phone screen though.

Question is: is it worth it the difference between S20 and S20+? Because there is quite a difference on the price and unless that DepthVision is reaaaally woth it, I&#39;ll stick with S20.What&#39;s your opinion?

S20 or s10+ which phone do you prefer plz reply

Almost as fast as me

I&#39;m fine with my s9, no games lag on it or anything, no reason to switch to a new phone.

What about ALL the BLOATWARE?  Samsung has way too much bloatware in its phones!

That is one ugly phone series... why are all the new phones so ugly and lack any useful features...

Hi Marques, I would like know which one these smartphone is better in term of price, processor, camera i.e. Samsung S20+; Iphone 11 Pro and Google Pixel 4. While in UK sumsung s20+ is coming with Exynos 990 Processor. Let me know because quit confuse.Thanks and RegardsMohammad Usman

no headphone jack.... its not bad, bad is finding dongles with good sound quality and even compatibility

Hey, are you sure about no mmWave on the S20+? Everything I can find says the S20+ does support mmWave

Should I skip this and wait for the Note 20 instead?

Shiiid I&#39;ll just stick to my s8+ for a couple of more years.. they say the s20 is almost 1300, but what about the basic accessories are they included?

Samsung hardware + Pure Android would be amazing :DD OneUI is very heavy, clunky feeling IMO

My mind: iPhone 11 proMy heart: Galaxy s20 my wallet: Galaxy A10e

The Indian variant is disappointing...no 5G no SD865.

Naggor brands
Over price  Period.

Can wait to upgrade from my S8 to and S20

They quietly removed the heart rate sensor...

its beautiful

My dad got a order of this s20 it&#39;s coming soon

Genuine question: Why do tech channels never put in the same amount of attention towards their compact flagships? I can understand the hype and infatuation with the bigger flagships. Hell, I&#39;m even the type of person that would purchase a plus size flagship over a compact flagship but can&#39;t we also find out more about the smaller flagships? I know compact smartphones have little to no difference between themselves and their bigger brothers but I want to know how their battery holds up. I want to know more about the smaller smartphones and what they have to offer in comparison to the bigger flagships. Are they worth more than their bigger brother? What are the pros and cons of owning a smaller flagship? I&#39;m not complaining. I do appreciate the time tech channels put in to making and editing their videos. I also appreciate how they attend events and try out different devices in everyday life. I just wish there would be a little more attention paid to the smaller flagships too. For example, I&#39;m mostly hearing about the S20 ultra. I want to know about the S20 and the S20 Plus too. And not just the Samsung lineup but other brands too. Does anybody else feel the same way or is this just me?

1k for the &quot;cheap model&quot;? Yeah, no thanks.

I never bought a flagship phone... Still using a midrange phone, I bought back in 2017..Just here to marvel at the advancement in technology.. and I&#39;m just poor.. 

This has probably already been commented but, the regular S20 is the only one with the mmW 5G while the + and Ultra variants are apparently supported.

The 120hz functionality will be turned off if the battery gets warmer than 42 degrees. Further when the battery reaches 5% also. The native camera app will also use only 60hz plus google maps and some other apps. Now i understand why 120hz is limited to full hd.

Should i rather buy s20 or oneplus 7t pro

Love to see sara dietschy even in blurred. superb juggling

I got a s7 time to get that s20+ !!!! For my b-day

Plz do a video on s10 lite
<a href="">4:28</a> Correction: S20 will not have mmWave, the plus and ultra will.

You lost me at 3 9s there

You are the best

Apple: Samsung is falling behind... lets make the iphone 12.Samsung: S20

The camera looks like a damn stove.

Just once I&#39;d like to see a video from you without you saying &quot;literally&quot;.

Will 4g LTE work on the s20 plus?

I can&#39;t  wait till they come out with a phone with a cost of $2500.00

So is this really 4.5g? Just like phone companies hoodwinked people with 2.5g

Question:I heard the S20 5G comes with the SnapDragon chipset and the S20 4G version (only available in a few regions) comes with a Exynos chipset, is this true?

Samsung be like:New decade, new me

anybody who is paying above 600$ for an Exynos processor are just getting scammed by the Koreans...only Qualcomm or the apple bionics make sense to pay the premium!

S20 screens are not edged? Like the ones on S10s that were always breaking? Really want this phone

um would the 120hz be better than the 60hz (just curious)

I just spent $1100 on note 10 plus 6 months ago.No 120 hertz, no awesome camera, no bigger battery, no snapdragon 865.Goodbye note 10 im gonna miss you, not.. Guess i should have spent my money in 2020 instead

most noobs haven&#39;t even enabled 120hz mode in settings but think it&#39;s still fast

Meanwhile I&#39;m still rocking a lgv20 lol. Still pretty fast and responsive

That girl cute but I bet she crazy af

no headphone jack whyyy SAMSUNG :(
S20 or s20 plus? Which one should i go for. I am really getting for the cameras and batteries. But, s20 and s20 plus doesn&#39;t have really big difference in that. So what should i go with??

I saw the review and i will stay on my s10+ because is still a great phone.

Just imagine these phones would havr brought back the headphone Jack. Just imagine.

I will keep my lg g7 thinq. Great phone for my needs.I will never pay $ 1000 for a phone . 5g technolgy is so bad for us...-cancer and other health problmes guaranteed:( , I wish the  tech guys would educate themselves and talk about it on thier channels.... You have no idea how bad it truly is....

&quot;I&#39;m recording before that&quot;

How many people actually need a $1,000 phone? I used a cheap android while abroad and the only complaint was the camera. I have an s8 right now. Sure I would like a better camera but it isn&#39;t worth over $1,000 to me

MKBHD is praising Samsung a lot even after the fact that they are kind of cheating the customers by boosting about 5g and 8k videos whereas that’s not the case... Seems like this video was sponsored by Samsung haha.. Lately, I have started liking verge videos more than yours and I feel like they are genuine, anyways just an opinion like yours. Peace 

Nice  phone

Bought s10 Lite yesterday... no regrets.  Those s20 prices are off the roof

Me seeing Marques wearing an Apple Watch : look at this dude he’s a trader My army : he has made master upset attack him charge

I like flatter screens, no use in curved ones...

hey What&#39;s up!

Just pissed Samsung killed the notification light

Why samsung is not sending you review units?I&#39;m really confused whether to buy Note 10+ or s20+

It&#39;s so funny, wen samsung gets 8k and all instead of talking about it u talk about how it cannot track and all, so lame, I still remember wen apple said 3d touch for ntg just a long press these same guys were like omg omg omg wat a feature 

Me: how in the world Apple think they the best when Samsung is 9 phone’s ahead Apple : ohhh f**k

Regular s20 or one plus 7t pro Mc Larsen edition??

U look jealous 
Lol people are so funny if you don&#39;t have the money to buy this phone don&#39;t want others to feel sorry for you

<a href="">1:13</a>, super responsive...
Still never getting another Samsung

Is the sound based fingerprint reader better now? In the S10 wasn&#39;t as fast or reliable as most others with capacitive or optical scanners.

Does anyone know of any Temp Glass options for the regular Galaxy s20?

They&#39;re OLED not AMOLED?

can it display instagram stories without cropping now?

I love my Ericsson T39 
Apple: releases the first iPhoneMarques:So I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now and this is my full review

Actually on their website it’s only 600 dollars

Who else came here cuz mbk yelled st us in the ultra video

Year 30000 humans colonise the Galaxy.....Marques Brownlee God!

We don&#39;t all have a G and a Half to spend on a new phone......Marques Brownlee I laugh in the face of you mear mortals!

can i just say that 8k vid, 12 gb ram, 120hz display etc.. are all just so useless? im pretty sure there are more people who doesn&#39;t need those feature than those who actually needs it and those who needs it still and will always use professional cameras. so what&#39;s the point? to increase price so they get richer?

The color of wallpaper is just amazing.

Graphene batteries next year.

I&#39;m probably one of the few who isn&#39;t a big fan of these large phones. I think my 7s edge is big enough. I don&#39;t really enjoy toting bulky stuff in my pockets &amp; I&#39;m not a purse carrier.

No one has mentioned the removal of the Samsung Health Sensor on the rear :-(

NO HEADPHONE JACK. how did you not mention that? that&#39;s a MASSIVE downgrade and definitely would make me second guess my decision.

Literally just got the s10. AH

Totally out of the blue but What does MKBHD stand for ? 

<b>I buy a phone</b>Samsung: <b>Makes the next phone the biggest just up yet</b>

&quot;Nothing to complain about&quot;So we&#39;ve given up and just accepted higher prices &quot;for less features&quot; such as missing headphone jacks? It&#39;s like feature distraction.What about a true successor to the S10e where it&#39;s still a small enough size to do things with one hand?It&#39;s still a very nice phone, but some industry practices just continue to bother me.

2020 $1200 s20 and my 2018 pixel 3 still gets more software updates...

Guys u don&#39;t know that in india .....an iPhone xs max is $2000

I love pink

one question.....will watching netflix on s20 120hz screen make any differences? better and smoother than regular 60hz screen?

Samsung
For a thousand bucks, I am underwhelmed. Thanks Marques!

On this 21st day of Black History Month, we salute the FATHER of mobile cell phones, Jesse Eugene Russell 

Gotta say; I see no reason to upgrade from my 2nd Gen. A5.Now when my wife gets a wireless charging phone, then I will become interested in a phone that can buddy charge her.

The problem is, Snapchat and insta still look shit lol

Same plastic crap as last year.

i like how they kept 1 front camera on the plus so it doesnt take up much of the screen

Just an update all Samsung S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra will have 120HZ refresh rate at QHD+ with a firmware upgrade. Samsung confirmed it themselves.

Hiii!! Marques Brother im in LOve with what you are doing here really and i was looking for a good samsung phone For i have tried iphone x For 1 month and half and i felt not connected to iphone sadly as it was my first time using iphone, but i decided now not to use Iphone no more so as i was watching your videos i said let Marques send me one of his best samsung Phone watever it is i promise i will take it Hahaha, Man Dont Disapoint me.Subscriber Hehe Thanks in Advance All Love ~~!!!!

The prices for phones are now getting ridiculous. These arent even the notes. I dont want to know what the note 11 will cost.

As the s series is jumping from s 10 to s20\. samsung is also trying to push their prices at high. so expensive models but its worth it

I wish I had money

Samsung doesnt launch the SD processor in India. Fuck you Samsung

Can&#39;t wait to scoop this up...3 years from now...On black friday...With my trade-in...

Idk they&#39;re really pushing their phones out too fast imo, I traded my s10+ that I pre-ordered for a One+ 7t pro 5g McLaren and I&#39;m never going back. My s10+ was incredibly laggy, buggy and actually froze several times, I always make sure to close apps im not using and the most work I put my phone&#39;s though is watching youtube. But this one+ 7t McLaren is out of this world good especially for the price point

I can&#39;t even keep up with these new phones anymore. I had my S10+ for maybe 6 months before the screen cracked (made the mistake of not getting a new SP right away), so I switched to Iphone 11 since it was a good deal going on, and 2 months later the S20&#39;s come out and I had no idea they were on the way. Would have waited. I still have the S10+ on my account I just have to keep it for another month and a half before I can put a claim on it so it gets fixed, maybe I will use the money from selling it to pay off the iphone and switch back, but honestly I am liking the simplicity of the iphone, but I will always prefer the customization and personalization of the galaxy.

I still have my S8 and while I really like it, I was over the curved screen reeeal quick  and I also don&#39;t want to upgrade because of the missing headphone jack, ever increasing prices, ugly notches or cameras directly on the screen (instead of being hidden in the bezel) and the removal of expandable memory to force me to buy a higher gb phone.

Lol I loderlynjust got this phone

I love you you did that cutaway about the 1080p 120hz bit. Like a quick update from the busy command center lol :D

So cool, can&#39;t wait to upgrade to the s9

Are these out yet?

<b>A wild nog appears </b><b><a href="">5:35</a></b>

Why did I waste my time watching so many other S20 videos instead of just going straight to Marques&#39;s channel first. As always, the best new phone video out there!

Can’t wait until one of these phones have the capability of recording a video while still playing the music on the phone

Massive 12GB of ram, so called 8k videos and 108MP with 100x zoom! Really??? What Samsung is trying to do !?!

responds to touch input twice as fast, but <a href="">1:29</a> it still is slow to respond to the touch

<b>Plus Ultra</b>
If we keep on making iPhones bigger aren’t the just iPads with like 20 cameras

Apple skipped number 9 samsung let&#39;s skip 9 numbers 
though ive been spending close to 1K euro / dollar every phone upgrade...i really come to wonder wether these machines are priced accurately.feel like theyre taking the piss and making us overpay as ALWAYSfucking piece of shit capitalistic pieces of brain cancer. fuck you all. make life better, not worse u money eating CEO&#39;s of doom, jeez.

Hi i&#39;m very poor and i need a tablet for my studies i thank you help me thank you

Eat your cereal
where can I buy the same white color one?

With more then two cameras, the vertical orientation is ugly in my opinion. Horizontal is much better.

Only complaint...no 120hz 1440p.  Sad.

Finally found Marques&#39;s girlfriend  &lt;3

Buy the S20 Ultra or wait for the next iPhone Pro in September?

Apple - Skip Number 9Samsung - Skip 9 numbers.
Having seen the 120hz in person on a demo unit (that I made sure to set to 120hz); I&#39;ve got to say it&#39;s noticeable, but not really an epiphany or anything. Gonna stick to my S10e as long as possible (compact phones FTW).

Interesting tho... Why are your vids still 30fps? Why aint you doing 60fps?

You&#39;re wrong on the 5G spec. The Ultra and Plus both have mm Wave 5G. The S20 standard has Sub 6 5G

I&#39;m just going to wait for the note 20 ^~^ (Changing phones once every second year after the warranty expires and give the old one to my brothers)

Please review the galaxy buds

Super Responsive <a href="">1:14</a>
What are you talking about? You can record this youtube video at 120fps, render it in 4K at half the speed and we simply play the 4K 60fps video in 2x speed and BOOM - 120fps youtube video.

They stole design from the Google PIxel 4.

8k is a resolution. That does not equate to quality. What about bitrate/compression? Yeah it could be 8k but look like noisy compressed mush

What is the green line going on the phone screen at <a href="">2:55</a> ?

Says the man who dropped 10k on sneakers! Lol

12 GB RAM.....I don&#39;t have that much in my gaming PC...

Looks nice! Now hopefully Apple also gets rid of the notch.

You&#39;re the man. But as soon as you listed the price, I gotta be out. Samsung loyalists for nearly a decade. Pixel 3a XL stopped the need for any phone over $500.

Watch my channel 
Hey MKBHD!I&#39;m a huge fan! Could you make a video of top 5 truly wireless earphones please... 

v

Remember when we thought the iphone X was expensive

Pls make a s20 e samsung!!!

No headphone jack. Dude.
As a software engineer myself I can tell you right of the bat, that 12 Gb of Ram is totally unnecessary because you&#39;re not gonna be able to make fully use of even half of it ! (Maybe) if you had 4 intense games ruining at the same time plus a music app and Gmail on top of that, and even then it wouldn&#39;t work because android would start shutting things down on the device for obvious reasons. Its like putting a Ferrari engine on a moped and expect it to run well ! These are more or less marketing strategies to raise the prices and selling points for the consumers, from Samsung and the rest.

still breaks and cracks on first drop. make unbreakable phones please?

Downside: battery should be 1000mah larger, headphone jack, not using exynos processors outside US and price

5g doesnt exist yet and any douche that says it does is a liar

Oh I thought you were all about the ASUS, sell out

do you think that the s20 ultra will work fine with the osmo 3 gimbal?

<a href="">2:25</a> Leaked software says that Samsung will aloow 1440p and 120 Hz

finally 10x zoom is better\//

MKB Awesome Video and read they will be pushing updates out soon on what you mentioned. Tbh I actually need to take a break for all the great Videos and Coverage I have watched and read so far.Everyone did a Awesome job with all the great information I wanted to see and hear but you know I love following up on all the new devices and try and get as much information I can.Great Video and definitely enjoyed will be back to check out more.Thank so much for sharing Deb 

I thought that was $20 in the title. I nearly had a heart attack

I&#39;m gonna hold my breath until these phones get cheaper, goodbye cruel world.

Man your reviews are awesome! You rock! I just think you could do reviews like that on 60fps video. It&#39;s not a big deal and I know it is more expensive. Anyway, keep working like that and thanks for sharing :)

Just ordered the s20+ for the same price as the cheaper s20 by selecting the trade in

Nice apparently I&#39;m not the only one who smells the BS around here /gags.,..

So what he&#39;s saying is to go buy a S20 model. Better start saving. 

Keeping my Galaxy s9+

I&#39;m not buying any of the new phones out there.  Samsung, iPhone.  They can easily sell them in half of the price but they decide to keep squeezing the customers wallets every year more and more

iPhone user since 1. Generation, thinking about to switch to the S20!

Does it have the same image processing software as the S10? Cuz the pics on my S10 plus suck. Soft and lack of fine detail. It isn&#39;t the lenses. I downloaded the gcam the the pics are sharp as they were on my 2xl.Many people have complained on the Samsung support page about it. Too bad to have all those fancy lenses with terrible image processing.

<a href="">3:56</a> damn that union storm blues

I don&#39;t know what to do, if a switch to the new phone s20 or stay with the s10? Can someone help me please lol

NO phone JACK downside

12gb of Ram???

so now samsung phones will have the number of the year they came out, this is good branding

this phone looks like a tv remote

Why do we need 8k videos? It&#39;s a waste of time and money

Waiting for a &quot;which S20 you should buy&quot; video??

It&#39;s kinda sad that he didn&#39;t not even mention about the death of headphone jack.

I&#39;m still happy with my pixel 3 xl

Nice One

So advanced and......without LED notification (facepalm)

It’s 94 pixels not 108

Love your T-shirt with the RGB &quot;mountains&quot;. Where did you get it from? :D

Every single time I listen to you saying you &quot;can&#39;t&quot; show the refresh frame rate thing and bla bla bla because of Youtube&#39;s 30fps, I think you MUST post your videos in 60fps. Not that it is cinematic and stuff, but for your &quot;need&quot; (to show the increase os quality to you viewers), that would fit great!

You are wrong MB S20+ and S20 ultra same 5G

They shoot the 8K on the telephoto probably because that would be the only reason to actually shoot 8K on a phone. To retain image quality if you punch in. I would never shoot anything 8k on a phone for the actual resolution because it would just be pointless. But if I wanna shoot previz for a project and I want to be able to fuck with the image in post to show more accurately what kind of thing I want for a main shoot with a real camera that would be sick. It&#39;s like the whole duel apature thing. It doesn&#39;t mean anything to the average consumer they were never going to use it, but for those that actually want it, that makes a big difference.

Move the back button to the left, Cowards!

I don&#39;t really like the flat display. I got an s10 because of the curved display and the performance as well as the cameras. I may not get the s20 because of the design changes.

I want to get Samsung s20 but that is so expensive 

This phone is ridiculous in terms of specs

I hate that Samsung phones get screen burn in even if you keep your brightness on medium

Well done for the s20. Nice setup btw!Now lemme see that Note20 

Wha - - -! No Note?

Samsung phones can record 8k videos but can’t send that high quality video in a text message. And the quality won’t upload that high to any form of social media. Pointless high specs that you can’t even see the quality on any other platform 

S20+ does support mm wave - only the S20 will be sub-6

Not convinced. Not worth the price. But many will go for it.

samsung: well since apple had a square camera bump lets make ours a rectangle

Soon the world will have to decide whether to buy a car or a phone 

No headphone jack, no thank you.

Is this phone waterproof?

So apparently, it&#39;s the main camera  that&#39;s 64MP on the s20 and s20 plus. The specs say that it&#39;s the telephoto one, but you can only take 12MP photos at 3x zoom, and only the main camera at 1x can shoot  64MP photos.

I stopped at 120hz @ 1080p.

I LOVE Marques&#39; videos. But the mess up in this one with the refresh rates is hilariously embarrassing. He raves on and on about how cool this 120Hz refresh rate is and how he can tell the difference even compared to 90Hz on 1+ 7Pro, then he just cuts in a disclaimer that it actually comes out of the box set on 60Hz and that was what he was looking at the whole time... Goes on to show how much it&#39;s just another tech sheet gimmick / PLACEBO (just like admits in regards of the 108 MP camera in the S20 Ultra video) that doesn&#39;t necessary mean that you will find it to be the best display on any phone, you might prefer other manufacturers more realistic color-toning.So on one hand it&#39;s a spec king flagship, on another hand the most gimmick-y flagship that was ever released:-Adds claim it&#39;s 1440p @ 120Hz refresh rate but you can either set it at 1080p @ 120Hz or 1440p @ 60Hz :(-Claims to shoot 8K video, which it does but only on the telephoto lens which means narrower field of view and worst actual image quality than what the main camera could produce, also some of the stabilization features get disabled on this resolution-Drags about upgrading the battery, but actually 4000mAH for 5G and 1440p on 6.3&quot; is rather slim, phones like my old Huawei Mate 8 (since which I have changed devices twice) came out with 4000mAH on 4G and a 6&quot; 1080p display in 2015!!! Had a really good display and had no trouble going on for 2 days, 3 days with moderate use!!! This won&#39;t last a full day if you keep the refresh rate on 120Hz (even if it dims the resolution down to 1080p) and keep the 5G service enabled...So this phone is pretty much for geeks who care about spec sheets and not actual usability / performance. An iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max has just as good of a display if you disable the higher refresh rate on the S20s (which is the automatic setting), the camera quality most likely will still be better on the iPhone even though all 3 cameras are only 12MP on that one (and actually the iPhone camera system has a much faster and smoother transition between the different viewing angles) and the battery life will still be better thanks to iOS optimization and the energy efficiency of the A13 chip-set... and they sell for the same price and actually Galaxy will start loosing it&#39;s value earlier as iPhones always keep their prices until the next one comes along in the fall...

The blue color looks so... white.

I hate the camera designs<i>[ This user has been banned ]</i>

Make your videos at 60fps please

I still have my S9+ and am still super happy with it

What a huge disappointment: No 4K video at 120 Hz!

What a huge disappointment: No 4K video at 120 Hz!

You do realize that YouTube has a 60fps option, right?

8K videos are overkill, no one can deny that

Does s20 have edge lightning?

Does any of the S20 still have wireless powershare?

Did I just hear Peter?

Why do I still feel like it&#39;s not worth upgrading from my galaxy note 8 that I&#39;ve had for 3 years now 

Bro too much calling out of pun intents. But too savvy?

None of these phones are well priced. Most users would not even need or notice these upgrades. Samsung&#39;s s10e was a workhorse which they phased out after hooking people into the android environment. People should be talking about that. Other companies are making competitive products for cheaper and that&#39;s really where the innovation is. Cheaper for better if you can&#39;t really provide anything groundbreakingly new. I liked the video, I usually like this guys videos but this isn&#39;t a phone I&#39;m going to invest in to support the sky high rubbish prices.

I gave up on buying flagship phones, last year. Im now 100% satisfied with my Samsung A50 for 280€. I get it if you are phone gamer, etc. I appriciate the company to evolve their cameras, but like we all know gear doesnt make you good.

Curved display should not be made flat. Thats it

Is that much different with the 12 MP depth sensor on the S20+ for the photography?

Why don&#39;t you shoot 60 fps videos? Just curious. Although that wouldn&#39;t solve the problem of 90Hz or 120Hz displays, but just an improvement over 30 fps.

Samsung watches MKBHD videos to learn what they are designing.

Finally the stupid curved screen is gone. I will likely retire my trusty Galaxy S6 for an S20 this fall.

IMO, Samsung consistently makes their phones and phone experiences better and better.

Should I wait for Pixel 5 to beat this design and specs? haha jokes.

4k at 60 fps look look smother and sharper than 8k at 24 fps I bet. On the note 8, 1080p at 60 fps was much better than 4k at 30fps

Was Samsung not working on a smartphone with graphite battery?

Funny how all companies laughed at Apple’s iPhone camera design on the back of the phone but now everyone is using it

The micro SD is why I would be upgrading

NO MORE CURVE, YES.

<a href="">2:07</a>Is that a reactor I see on the bottom left?

Marques, do you prefer the FEEL of this phone with its &quot;flat&quot; edges compared to the curved edge screens of past Samsungs? I&#39;m not talking about &quot;usability&quot;, like for example how the curved edges caused more inadvertent screen touches. I&#39;m simply asking about how it feels in the hand to use it with a &quot;flat&quot; screen.

Stilllllllll the top and bottom bezels...

I thought they were mmwave and sub 6. AT&amp;T site says 5GE, 5G, and 5G+

thanks Apple

Samsung: let&#39;s leak the S30/S21 Ultra MKBHD: so, i&#39;ve been using the S40/S22 Ultra Max for 2 weeks..

Watching this on my LG G2 lol

Loosing features gaining price :) Get lost samsung. in past several iterations lost, ir blaster, heart rate sensor, headphone jack but gained price like never before :) Also please test for yourself transition effects when selecting zoom is jittery and laggy. And better all 120Hz only in FHD :( So for me last best flagship from samsung was S9 plus period...

Thank god they noticing that consumers really dont care about curved screens we want the full display experience flat as any tv or laptop screens

People who say they can&#39;t see the difference between 90hz, 120hz, and 240hz should not be allowed to have an opinion on anything ever again.

I just watch expensive phone reviews even though I can not afford

Samsung is going out all with its S20 phones( especially S20 Ultra) and its new foldable; Z flip.

Looking forward to the 21 Savage series next year.

S20 series HAS NO SNAPDRAGON 865 in Europe, it has Exynos 990 which is 20% slower (but is doesn&#39;t cost less money). Many europeans will miss that fact and wont understand why gameplay isn&#39;t stable and smooth all the time on their device. For Europeans, if you want the best, the s20 series aren&#39;t because of this.

Sine you&#39;re at 10+ million subscribers, will you consider boxing Logan Paul or KSI?  Lmao

Damn, you&#39;re at 10.5 million subscribers!?
Music playback???

Whats the intro music

2030: 4k looks like trash, and 1080p was from the WW2 days

Why don&#39;t you ever review or mention Sony phones?

What the hell are you zooming into..

8K only on the zoom sensor and no milimiter wave, combined with the 120hz at 1080p make no sense to me. I mean, if I&#39;m spending $1300 I want the best of the best

so at <a href="">1:40</a> you can feel the difference between 90hz and 120hz, than u tell us that  u just heard about that u need to change it in the settings first. so it was 60hz.. placebo? :)

8k doesnt make sense in this phone. The compression-rate is so big, that you practically get a worse resolution than a good 1080p ... Secondly: no headphone-jack - no buy - sorry Samsung... YES i know &#39;earbuds&#39;-bla .. but NO.. simply no... There is no way, to get the same audio-quality out of earbuds, than with highend-headphones.thirdly:  camera-bump... sorry but if i want to have a camera-bump, i go to Apple ... Samsung was my choice because they tried to make the camera-bump go away... a camerabump is a big chance to get a broken phone, or get scratches on the camera, etc ... All the other specs arent really important (maybe the two akg-speakers (as far i know they are two speakers in the S20 , which is a good advantage)..But otherwise... the 120hz-display isnt very important... bigger battery, ok, but it is eaten up by bigger screen, and the 120hz ... so probably no advantage... The 7nm process is nice... but doesnt bring a lot in the daily experience... The camera with his zoom is &#39;trying to chase Huawei&#39;s ideas&#39; .... probably the camera is way behind the Huawei-cameras... There is no good reason, to buy this over the S10... or even the S8

I hate how Samsung keeps copying apples model and naming convention. Apple keeps trying to separate itself and Sumsung is like that annoying weird kid that stalks you and won’t go away, you walk away you look back and the kid won’t stop following you. Smh

Good touch... @ <a href="">1:45</a> did he touch twice?

Bigger battery. Slightly thicker. Return of the headphone jack??

Did they seriously stopped doing curved screens?? :((

So should I buy S10+ or S20?

Didnt the s10 come out like yesterday?  the hell is up with all this bs. The the s8 is still good for another 10 years whats the difference?

5G causes cancer,    We are doomed

but still sell exynos chip version to the asian region 

Go to r/android on reddit. Seems like some have figured out Samsung may have lied about the camera specs on their new s line of phones. Seems there are some upset new customers.

My brain:appleMy heart:appleMy wallet:vivo(120 dollars)

I just wandering how many phones we have dumped in landfills. These phone makers roll out new phones like crazy. For my self alone at least 7 of them.  I feel <b>SINNED</b> watching this video for wanting a new flagship. (From my LG g5) By the way, why I cannot get a new battery for my LG g5. These phone makers ARE BAD BUTTOCKS!!!!!!!!

You sucks

I&#39;m so jealous of his apartment!

This guy never ever talks about Call Quality

MKBHD idk if you knew this but literally noone uses bixby

hey guys so anyone who didn&#39;t understand ANYTHING he said, like my comment. sick but i still dont know what he said

Fun Fact: India doesn’t get the 5G capable S20 Ultra but rather a specialized 4G LTE model with an underpowered Exynos chip as always.

Oh my goodness, the prices are so expensive
Why are you guys focused on the stupid camera? Most of yours and the other guy&#39;s videos are about the camera. Who cares? We all don&#39;t want to take pictures of our whole lives for everyone to see. What about the speakers? Are they up to par with the ROG phone 2 speakers?

if you still want to buy apple there&#39;s something wrong with you lmao

gonna check out reviews after it comes out then replace my s10e

Mi 10 Pro

U don&#39;t need this. Pointless consumerism. Makes you think you need something before it&#39;s even out. Keeps the elite rich and keeps your poor and busy

no impulse at all
Marques, you mention that Samsung upgraded the touch refresh rate to 240Hz. Do you have an idea what the touch refresh rate of the S10 was? 60 or 120Hz?

Could have called it galaxy zoom lol took you seconds the invovation team probably on that for months 

Nice hardware, I just wish it came with Android One…

Very expensive...
can i have it

am I the only one feeling like the phone sounds great and amazing on paper, but many of the cool features have quite a lot of downsides to them, which doesn&#39;t make it so amazing anyways. what&#39;s your guys&#39; opinion

<a href="">2:20</a> lol : Wow its 120 hz, very fast...bla bla bla... oh was set at 60 hz LOL

slow , verry slow , is not instant

Honestly that Single Take mode looks really awesome. I definitely get wanting to take the photos yourself, but when traveling, out with friends or trying to snag a picture of a fleeting moment, I could see myself using that feature all the time! I&#39;m definitely really interested in that.

nah fam the back is so ugly imma stick w my s10 plus 

And apple will slap on 1 new feature and its GOLD

One major downside for me, no headphone jack. I will skip Samsung phones unless no other phones with jack are available.

Imagine being so poor you cant afford a Samsung

<a href="">4:05</a> snapdragon 865??

This race will drive us crazy, I will just stop at my iPhone X plus, am done of racing ..

6.7 inch? You need a Kawhi Leonard hands to handle this phone one in one hand.

Oh man, your videos are always so pleasant to watch.  Top quality both content-wise and in terms of editing.

You used the pun intended &#39;focus&#39; in your one plus 5 review. I never forget

But no headphone jack :(
I like your review, good job, however you emphasized only the &quot;S20 Ultra supports 5G mmWave&quot; but I noticed many websites state the S20+ and the S20 ultra, supports &quot;sub-6&quot; and mmWave 5G

S20 ultra battery is 5000...not 4500

That TouchWiz looks the same as S3 did in 2011.

Is it worth it to upgrade from s10+ to s20+????

Waits for JerryRigEverything to tear them apart....

The future is now.

Price incrase for not useful stuff again. Gj

next year galaxy s21 s21+ s21ultra , s21ultra legend

Pretty sure only the regular s20 doesn&#39;t support mm wave 5G.

year 3000 Samsung unveils their new phone galaxy s1200.

Can you still use 60hz with 1080p? Personally I don&#39;t see much difference between 1080p and 4k on phones and I don&#39;t care on 120hz.

The branding&#39;s too messed up, which strangely has caused me to lose interest in the S series.

When iPhone users start getting toxic that Samsung is now better

I&#39;m still happy with Galaxy s10 non + variant, still as fast as should be for me

its funny how the camera is one of the most important categories of a smart phone today lolz...

Does it have a headphone jack?

review on their obsesssion to force bixby on us?

Like if youre photographer who is laughing here.

One ui with 120 hz refresh rate excited to use this beast definitely gona preorder it in India when it launched.

<a href="">1:13</a> He tries to swipe left but don&#39;t work XD

Looks very nice except for that odd camera-box on the back. That box is fugly.

I just got the new iPhone 11pro”coughs in regret”

<a href="">2:14</a> is that keychron k2?

please do a review on samsung s10 lite

Ok, so all of u guys saving that Stock Android &gt; One UI must be out of ur minds. Stock android is boring as hell with less features. Seriously, what is wrong with this World. Idiots.

Those dislikes are apple lovers.

I dont really feel like this is the biggest leap. S9 to S10 was a greater leap in my opinion.

For iPhones: Just a camera? Just some tweaks? Who&#39;s ready to pay so much??    For any other android: even if some little tweaks, hardly any room to judge. Bam! $1,400 here, take my money!

U know u can upload 60fps to youtube?

Hey is there like a mode where you can switch to 90 Hertz instead of 120??

how fast is the charging speed?

I don&#39;t like the design

Great video as always!! Not sure if it&#39;s really great innovations from Samsung, but that is my own opinion.&quot;Big jump in battery to 4500mah&quot;Agreed... But I&#39;ll pass while I watch this on my 6,000mah ROG phone 2 :)120hz screen and 1080p... ROG 2 already has it and im enjoying it on last year&#39;s phone.8k video... I don&#39;t even use 4k, but each to their own. 4k is enough for me, does anyone find 4k not enough??No more curve edge, again in my opinion, it was one thing that set Samsung  premium phones apart... Now removed.

looks like there’szero response in the swipe at <a href="">1:15</a>

2010: Galaxy S12011: Galaxy S2 and Galaxy S2 plus2020: Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 plus and Galaxy S20 Ultra2060:Galaxy S60Galaxy S60+Galaxy S60 UltraGalaxy S60 PremiumGalaxy S60 Ultra-PremiumGalaxy S60 GoldGalaxy S60 DiamonGalaxy S60 PlatinumGalaxy S60 God edition

I keep thinking it’s £20

Is the 64mp  a gw1 sensor? Theoretically the 108mp in mi 10 will be better for zoom 2-3x if it&#39;s for normal use

Will cost 400 in 9 months

To be honest, I don’t need a front facing camera, just make it all screen no cam. If u really want to take selfies, put a mini display on the back

the price is not samsung&#39;s bad, it&#39;s yours

Smarter phones  getting  people&#39;s  dumber
here i m still using s8 
Who came here after watching the first minute of S20 Ultra? :D

Do the battery lasts a whole half day now?

With the s10, when used in direct sunlight you could see the fingerprint reader through the screen.. can you please see if this is the case with the s20.

0 compromise
Nice. I&#39;ll grab it in 2021 when the ultra is on sale for $700.

oh man that phone looks pretty lit.  it&#39;s making my iphone 11 pro look dated already.

Does it have face unlock or not? AndroidPolice said it doesn&#39;t but the tech specs official page of Samsung says: &quot;Facial recognition&quot;.

So the new s20+ is the same price as the note plus now, cool!

I&#39;m struggling on getting that ultra or the 2080ti

S20 for the year 2020

what is your favorite Android if samsung is not your favorite flagship?

This question may seem stupid to most people, but I need to be absolutely sure before preordering, can the Galaxy S 20 models that are 5G ready still connect to the internet and operate normally without a 5G connection?

Actually a Samsung phone I&#39;d consider. Probably end up with Pixel 4a XL.

Ppl still have the audacity to complaint about the price when they demanded to ugrade everything... yes self-entitle people, upgrade everything is free for a company.

Having the s10+ is the first time im not considering in upgrading , it&#39;s still a beast 

Tired of watching all these expensive superphones with my outdated Oppo  but thanks for thr videos! I get to see phones i could never have!!

Big shortcoming actually he forgot : absence of 3.5 jack

I can&#39;t believe they didn&#39;t put a 1440p 90hz option. What a waste :/

I have an iPhone, but damn do I love the design team at Samsung. Consistently the best looking phones each year

I always like your videos.  I was always Droid/Samsung/Pixel devices for so many and only iPhone recently but I always feel like Droid beefs up the specs to try to get smoothness but I feel like iPhone achieves a lot more smoothness with less.. idk.. Well, I’m actually Glad to hear there’s no more edge screen.. I always hated that

Does it have a headphone jack? No. If they aren&#39;t putting the most basic things how can you call it an upgrade?

Is the traditional message notification LED still missing as it is on my S10+?

Mkbhd hater of samsung

They keep making memes about iPhones  camera but when Samsung makes a similar camera design but even BIGGER people don’t say anything 

Question is how well does it capture 4k video? What FPS?

(the audio could use a de-essing filter)

In 6 months the phone will be about half its price, so I’ll get it then

The Bixby button is gone, hallelujah

No one noticed that they removed heart rate sensor..

Can I just say that I really appreciate how you don&#39;t have the &quot;YouTube sing song-y&quot; voice. It is incredibly annoying that every video I watch sounds exactly the same and yours doesn&#39;t. Thank you!!

Just Galaxy S20&#39;s one grand is way above my budget (so freakin expensive) plus I&#39;m more interested in Apple&#39;s iPhone SE2 (or iPhone 9) for $400 :o

Damn, that price increase is to much. I&#39;ll probably not get the S20+ when my S8+ needs an upgrade.

I don’t think iPhone gonna get 120 hz screen anytime soon. I do have the iPad Pro with 120 hz so I think it’s time for me to go Samsung with phones now because 60 hz bugs me out since i’m used to 120 hx

Headphone jack?
I definitely prefer the camera setup on the s10 series. A horizontal bar instead of a vertical block

Imma stick with my s10+ for now

When the Phone is run at 120Hz mode the battery Only lasts 5 hours. 

Apple if you watchingPlease learn...

<b>Marques</b> there are rumors, that the S20 and S20+ don&#39;t have optical tele zoom cameras. They just crop a high resolution photo so it is basically a digital zoom.

Yeah, nah, those prices are way too exorbitant for an Android.

maaan you should pin somewhere the size of your hand and fingers because you are far more bigger than any avarage persooon

still a punch hole. nahhhhh tnx

When you have had a OPPO r11s for 3 years now and your contract ends soon, I can upgrade to this phone yay

<a href="">9:15</a> nice frame composition
Why mkbhd don&#39;t upload any 60fps videos?

Love the &quot;Editor Marques&quot; cuts

No extra programmable Bixby button? That alone is reason not to upgrade. I use mine for spotify.

Watching this on my note 10+. Minor upgrades not exactly game changers here. I&#39;ll wait until s21 for something actually mind blowing.

Could someone please confirm, what bluetooth audio codecs are supported on the Galaxy S20? does it support aptx, aptxhd and ldac? couldn&#39;t find this info anywhere...

Using the note 9 and for me, its now the best phone of 2010 - 2019 period. Honestly note 9 is more beautiful than this rectangular camera slab.

Made fun of apple for dongles, has to use dongle now trash phone&#39;s lg is the only good manufacturer still

I have never thought about buying huawei, ever but these prices of phones are just not normal anymore 750€ for S8 when it came out was the top for me. And not it might actually be time to buy a non samsung, apple phone but go to huawei

damn convinced myself to switch from s9 to iphone11, but a fingerprint reader....

I just wish the telephoto lens is working as supposed to be on normal photos. Unlike on s10 plus which only  zooms in the main camera. Telefake as we call it.

Lol about frequency and smooth scrolling. Marketing...

@Marques BrownleeWhat&#39;s about your t-shirt print? 

<a href="">1:15</a> Super responsive lol
Those square camera blocks are so unbelievably ugly. Who tf thinks they look good?..not upgrading to a new android or iOS until this trend dies

How CAN I BUY ONE OF YOUR PHONES

I like having the Bixby button. It&#39;s easily remappable to another app and as long as you have a samsung phone, bixby has some really useful functions

i beg samsung to hire new ui ux designers cuz the product designners are doing pretty great job but they need to hire the new interaction designers

i think Samsung is the true innovatorit does all the new think differentish changes to the smart phone at this point

I came here since you told me in the S20 ultra vid to come here first lol

I will buy the S10 when the S20 is on sale and the S10 becomes cheaper. The step is not so much up. I want to make nice pics, make/receive calls and check things in the internet. No gaming. I don´t need the newest $1,000 phone.

But curve displays look and feel pretty good. Looks futuristic

S20 - 12 Gigs of Ram!..Lads, welcome to 2020!

And I was almost correct I said Samsung ultra Will be a oversized 7&quot; I was 1&quot; off and another exploding phone

New year, new Samsung  New overpriced Samsung

Great video! Can you please confirm that both the S20 and S20+ will only have Sub 6 5G? I heard the 20+ and the 20 Ultra have mmWaves 5G. Thank you

single take looks so amazing

Asteri

Looks like its more powerful than my laptop!

No I am not gonna subscribe to you

Hmmm let see what note 20 gonna be.

what does punched in mean? with reference to the 8k video part?

And I&#39;m just chilling with my s7

What about there fingerprint scanner speed?

It&#39;s so disappointing that it has no headphone jackI guess I&#39;m sticking to the S10+ or ROG Phone II

so what do you prefer or what do you suggest, go to 120hz with 1080 full HD or keep it 60hz with quad 1440??

Samsung keeps getting better year after year..just reviewed the Samsung ultra..check out the review on my channel..please subscribe

Design looks like the s10 to be honest,I&#39;ll keep my s10 plus for now

Ha ha .. this was good one @<a href="">7:20</a>

Damn I really want this phone, but there&#39;s no way I&#39;m buying a phone with a hole punch.

When will you do another give away especially for the s20

Stuck between getting this or waiting for the Note 11...

Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra Pro is the future for Nanotechnology. Here we go...Too sleek to be ignored!!!

Ultra 
Am I the only one who just doesn&#39;t give a single fuck about what kind of camera it has?

Tired of paying thousands for expensive cameras because they have a good phone attached..



All I want is a bigass HD screen, a high speed connection, a good processor/ram combo and a bigass battery.. fuck the camera.

Soon there will be nothing to upgrade

I&#39;ll keep my s10e thanks, don&#39;t want to carry around a tablet in my pocket

Yup i will buy it.in 2024

<a href="">8:30</a> intro of a blacked video

<a href="">1:18</a> Anybody noticed that Marques&#39; thumb has evolved to work well on touch screens 

<a href="">1:45</a>  thats called sensitive

He makes even the biggest phone looks small.

S20, s20 plus or p30 pro?

MKBHD.Can you confirm that the unlocked S20 can be activated on verizon ( I know  they wont  have the s20 at launch date (because  of the lack of mmWave support) but I wonder  if I can get the unlocked  version  and get 4g signal?

&quot;we don&#39;t all have a G and a half to buy a phone&quot;. You mean &quot;you guys don&#39;t have a G and a half to buy this, because I am rich AF and will buy it in every fucking color available, eat that!&quot;

What&#39;s the wallpaper on the monitor behind him?

On the cosmic grey are the edges Chrome / silver or grey? Difficult to tell in the video?

I’m done chasing new phones. After two weeks I’m no longer impressed.

TBH Samsung has lost its creativity is just the upgrade of s10 no design improvement just minor changes and call it s20 lol mi mix alpha salute

Ever disliked someone so much for no reason? Yeah this is that guy. I cant look at this guy without cringing

Still stuck with the s8. But still consisten tho more than 2 years and still smooth. Might as well upgrade with the s20+ if i land a job with bigger salary lol

Is there SD card reader? 5G is also a waste

Nothing about the lack of headphone jack? There is no good reason to leave it out. You can still make a phone waterproof with a headphone jack. The overpriced samsung wireless earbuds aren&#39;t a good reason anyway.

Smartphones getting bored...
Watch English technology videos and practice English
Nice phone is off

No Marques-S10e = S20S10 = S20+S10+ = S20 Ultra

Teacher: Do you know numbers?Samsung: <b>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20</b>Apple: <b>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,9</b>

Hey marcus  does this phone like the iphone 7 have the option for recording live situations without compromising the quality of sound

Hope they make s20 with :milt 810 standard.

Another fake 120fps phone . You get more frames per second at the cost of image quality! Its the same problem with weak PC&#39;s,where users need to sacrifice quality for frames...

Are you going to make a full review before the phones lunch because I really need to see a review before being a 100% sure I’ll buy one

Nice Jordans 
Im not here to hear him reviewing ss s20 , im here to hear which accent he saying

Key feature: it&#39;s flatter. The one thing that I absolutely hate about my S10+ is the wrap over screen edges. Mainly because Samsung&#39;s accidental edge touch detection is terrible.

It feels like I just bought my S9 yesterday 

Weakness: no headphone jack
You&#39;re the Best ov o:oool my hero

So samsung makes a s20 with half working 5G, it can shoot vids at 8k but does change camera and makes filming diffrent, cant wait for iphone to beat the main features of the s20 to perfect on the iphone, just like the fingerprint, face id, resolution etc 

In just a few years that s20 will become just a piece of brick when the battery will not hold the charge

Same boring phone, almost no different from galaxy s8, nothing really drastically changed!

The sensor size is 1/1.76 not 1/1.176 as shown in the video

Imagine bringing this to your school 7 years ago 

Wow i have the s10 lol

Does anyone notice the aspect ratio that Marques uses on his videos ?!?! Wide angle 

Is there an audio Jack?

Now days if you are hard working employee is almost impossible to upgrade  every year Samsung&#39;s flagships . Prices are ridiculous

Call me crazy but I liked the way curved edges were before. Samsung did release an app that reduce the sensitivity of the edges but I can&#39;t say that I ever needed it for my S7e. The one thing that&#39;s wrong with this design choice is that the phone will look a little too much like the &quot;high-end&quot; phones they released previously (I think the A91 is one of them). Love the display all the same, and those wallpapers really bring out the best in that Dynamic Amoled panel.

Flat screen?! Awesome.

Asterisc lmao.

I’m all in with Apple but I must admit that notch-less screen looks nice. Good for Samsung

So samsung names its galaxy line by the decade huhS10: 2010-19S20: 2020-2029

Would still prefer my 7T Pro McLaren over this.

He was right about their ad video.More than half of the Samsung video was about the cameras on the s20 ultra 

I am big fan plz give me gift S20

Spends 1.4k on a phone<b>only gets 2 major updates</b>

Whatever it comes,I use my phone to games,camera, Instagram,WhatsApp,call,and videos,and looks premium so I choose apple always

It gets me so excited to know that I might actually get this phone in the next 3 - 5 yrs 

I got an S20 ad

<a href="">1:16</a> &quot;super responsive&quot; - swipes, does nothing.

Next all these companies are gonna force us to use wireless charges for their phones

I had a phone samsung once. After a year new model comes in, and my phone is like automatically became ancient. Thats why i shift to apple because even though i bought the iphone 7 plus, it doesn’t feel ancient because of wise decision apple made where they are focused on software and not hardware specs. By september this phone will be 4 years old and still works like i just bought it now. No other phones can do that except apple.

So headphone Jack is a thing of past now.

I broke my S5 over a year and i&#39;m using my backup phone the nexus 5 lol i was going to buy the pixel 4 but the reviews are shocking. The S20 looks brilliant, but in Australia it will be more likely to be like over 3 grand.

I just broke my s10+ 3 weeks ago. Tax season is here . I will be getting one of these new phns.

Taken biggest jump but cant give dac like lg 

“We don’t all have a G and a half to pay for that”Meanwhile this dude charges double than Nike does for their t shirts.

“We don’t all have a G and a half to pay for that”Meanwhile this dude charges double than Nike does for their t shirts.

“We don’t all have a G and a half to pay for that”Meanwhile this dude charges double than Nike does for their t shirts.

I&#39;m keeping my Samsung 8 note until it stops working. Fuck these mfs scammers. Same shit little tweeks

Damn id run this phone if it had ios

Samsung is going with full force wanting to dominate this year.

Price?

<a href="">1:14</a> I know you failed to swipe as soon as you said &quot;super responsive&quot; which is hilarious!

Curious, what is your favorite flavor of Android?

Why don&#39;t you shoot videos at 60fps??

I&#39;ve been following you for years through diff accounts (kept locking myself out) but thank you for keeping it not only super informative, but also realizing we aren&#39;t money trees, which most companies and YouTubers don&#39;t really get these days.

I don&#39;t care how it looks (looks too plain) but those specsheet does makes sense. Finally, a little bit thicker phone for a big battery

<b>*laughs in Samsung Galaxy S4*</b>
the samsung galaxy is too expensive

Does anyone know what Apple watch band that is

Hey bro. I&#39;m from India and I&#39;ve  started youtube tech channel one month ago. I wanna use images from company website like ,mi,samsung,apple,etc .Can I use it?

Wait wait wait, do they have headphone jacks?

I always considered getting a huaweii and now im starting to fi d my excuse $1399 fuck that once my s9 starts acting up ima leave samsung

I&#39;m still disappointed that they killed the &quot;s10e line&quot;, it&#39;s the most enjoyable phone i&#39;ve ever had.

120hz only at 1080p feels like a deal breaker

When you want to work at marques place you need to be able to juggle balls ;)

I don&#39;t like Android but that is nice

Oh my.  How I hate that Samsung elongated form factor

Didn&#39;t already had a S20 model or am I crazy?

Space zoom or Galaxy zoomOh come on Samsung you missed that

Everything is perfect about this phone except that fucking design ‍️. Just gonna stick to that s10 plus

I&#39;d never get the S20 Ultra when I can just hold for the Note

Hmm..dont know,im still choosing s10..this look cheap

Buy a pc from this money lol

A g and a half, they only this arrogant because America is being a c*nt by banning Huawei. Seriously, they need to stop throwing tantrums and lift the ban already for crying out loud.

At about <a href="">8:04</a> you said it&#39;s not your favorite flavor of Android. What is your top favorite?Thanks for the video! A lot of good information!

No jack, no buy. No company gets a pass, no matter how many start doing it, no matter how much time passes. It looks like I&#39;ll be saving money in the future as only &quot;budget&quot; phones seem to be willing to include headphone jacks any more.

how much would it cost to upgrade the s10 to s20 I wonder

If only it were stock Android...

Guys stop making hate commentsIm tired of liking them all

I think anyone who spends that much money on a cellphone is an imbecile and doesn&#39;t deserve to live among people.

Review Realme X2 Pro awesome device
These phones are becoming better than my pc :(

This has more views than the trailer

So to wrap it up camera, camera, camera, and camera is pretty much what the new samsung is giving us. Plus finally Bixby button is gone I hate it and never use it. Thanks 4 the review will go watch your ultra review now

I don&#39;t like Samsung and Android

Wow, didn&#39;t realize my Galaxy S8 is now 12 models behind. I knew time seemed to be going by fast but this is ridiculous!

I don&#39;t  know why people care so much about cameras. I get screen and processing power but I don&#39;t understand camera prioritisation.

Why do you not post videos in 60fps? That can still be done, can&#39;t it?

Watching this video with an s8.....life shouldn&#39;t be this hard

I am really not feeling these new phones and their multiple camera lenses on the back, it just feels off to me.

Awesome phone! Cant wait to see the review 

While phones keep improving, the only thing that seems to be lagging behind is longevity of batteries in smartphones.

Just a tad bit more than my Samsung J8

I sware that I didn&#39;t read &quot;duck&quot;.

Am I the only one with an s9+?  Nothing is wrong with it....but when you see this, I&#39;m kind of glad I skipped on the s10 upgrade
