Part of the show

A whalw and dolphin

Those are orcas.
This is just stupid. If you throw your money at these people, they will continue to  capture and incarcerate the whales and dolphins, only because they make money, and lots of it!

I remember they use to do this in San Diego.  Its staged but great to watch

That&#39;s not a dolphin tank

YouTube recommends this after 13 years...

I knew it was fake when she fell in then swam the exact opposite direction she needed to

They tried to freak the hell out of the kids. I would&#39;ve been screaming&quot;Get the hell out&quot;.

They should of started playing the Jaws theme lol

Wowsa

we men can not trust anyone to do that <a href="">0:58</a>, well done girls you win this time.

So a pretend accident is part of their show!! How utterly distasteful! I&#39;m not suprised!

It&#39;s all part of the show they do it on purpose

What an idiot. What an idiot. I can&#39;t even process the stupidity here. She swims screaming and then all the sudden she&#39;s a trainer in . 65 seconds.  She should have immediately gotten out of the water as she had chances to. Buy instead she went and wanted to put on a show. She&#39;s lucky she didn&#39;t get hurt smh

She looked like she was having a whale of a time

Dolphin be trying to save her be like

Was that girl part of the staff? She seemed so used to it

She didn&#39;t expect that

Cute. Even though it&#39;s staged..lol..employee..lol .hope ppl.don&#39;t think this is real. Lol..lol..

that was tense...

that girl was never in any danger it is clear to me that this whale wanted to do her routine and chose chrissy to perform it with... i say good job to them both sweet whale i just love her

She like i dont want to get put this is fun

Pre-blue horizon’s times
This was part of the show, it was my favorite as a kid

I think that might have been planned.

She was in on it, it was part of the show

Looks like she fell in on porpoise!

Now post just the first 5 seconds so it can blow up on Twitter.  You know like they do with cop videos.

Completely staged

This was all part of the show.

Huh, what

when I read dolphin tank, I expected dolphins to show up, not a pilot whale. I know they&#39;re also part of the dolphin family just like orcas but I was expecting the common bottlenose dolphins.

TOTALLY PLANNED!

Fake

Really Dolph I thought it was a skark dame I need glasses lol then

Dolphin boost in minecraft

This is an act. It&#39;s all an act

instructor:stay calmLady that feel in pool : continues to panic instructor: thats not calm !‍️

Its all an act.

I was at this show and it was played off as she was a trainer  ,at least we thought she was because it seemed staged

that was rehearsed cause a random Pearson would not balance on the nose of a killer whale if they fell in

That’s a dolphin?

<a href="">#thatsaorca</a>

I first I though it was killer whale but it is pilot whale. today they will not get in the water with killer whales but pilot whale are different. so far there no serous attacks form pilot whales in captivity.

Fake

oh wooooooowwww that was magificent DAMN THIS VIDEO CAM OUT IN 2008?!?! HOLY SHIT I WAS BORN IN 2004 SO WAIT WHHHHAAAAAA im done bye guys

What if her phone was in her pocket

Who swims in the middle of the pool I would swim to my right

AWSOME! !!

That would scare the shit out of me

yes..lol it was part of the show :P



Idk

@laura l woooooo

HAHAHAHHa i like how she tries driveing :D LMAOO

holy crap i would have peed my pants!!!! damn

@TheJeremy1998 wut. You... do realize you&#39;re responding to a comment made a year ago, right? And that you&#39;re making absolutely no sense whatsoever?

&quot;that is NOT calm&quot; I love this bit of the show.

IT&#39;S LIKE THEY HAVE NO IMAGINATION =(

imagine the dolphin got her up the a-hole.

man, this is part of the act, it aint real, can&#39;t u tell that??

... It&#39;s not a shark, dear. If you splash around and panic, you&#39;ll scare it. Or it may think you&#39;re food. 



Funny, though. :D And she was lucky that he wanted to play. &quot;That is not calm!&quot;

would have been cooler if the whale ate her bottom half and left her to float

Awesome experience.. a bit degrading but awesome!
