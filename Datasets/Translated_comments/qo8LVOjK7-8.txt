Ek thappad of acid

Salute to dipikareal queen both laxmii
Deepaka mam is very good actress

dipika ka chapak kai bad delhidange mai jane ka plane thaa

I hated Deepika after this movie
Who dislike this video don&#39;t have heart

Deepika deserves more then a million awards for being so brave to do this movie

Luv u Deepika ap ny bht mehnaat ki hai iss movie ma
Hats offf to the whole team

This video reminds me the poem &#39;Behind the scenes&#39;

I love her acting 

People who believe that deepika is truly a dedicated personality and she  tries her best and devotes towards her acting levels : Like below 

I would only say....... Justice for SSR.

How much hard work behind the movie , Hats of Deepika padukone.

Girls should see the movie and come out from the acid attack and love you deepika padukone madam and thanks for the movie

When will this film come on TV?
Ppl will her see her receiving awards, her success no one will the notice/acknowledge the hardwork behind that success (this vid is one such eg let&#39;s say that plaster of paris that was no less than a hard fight). In a country where ppl are being trolled, attacked, mocked nd boycotted for standing up for the right things she choose to be fearless. When most of the public figure&#39;s avoided paying solidarity to the JNU students , when they avoided the anti CAA protest she stood for it.....nd just think how powerful her presence is without even speaking a single word her presence just made the bakhts crazy......bold in reel life, bold in real life.....nd tanjahi just got fame becoz bhakts were on there way to mock this nation. One day everyone will understand the mistake they made by being andhbhakt&#39;s, being vocal about wrong government nd disrespecting the country are not same, anti national wo nhi hota jo government ke khilaf ho anti national wo hotey hai jo jane anjane mein desh ki barbadi ka karan baane.....jo already saarey bhakts hai (they are the actual anti-nationals).Nd yes just because chhapaak was an amazing film nd deserved success it is not for Australian teli academy awards nd not films like tanjahi which got fame for the sick mentality of the bhakts always spreading communal hate.Once a queen always a queen!! <a href="">#deepika</a> ️ <a href="">#proud</a>Nd yes those who were saying film dekhne se hoga kya film dekhne se society mein awareness failegi jo illerate&#39;s ko samajh mein aayegi bhi nhi aur just because of chhapaak many states ran ban acid campaign!!Nd everyone knows who did the actual PR work (bhakts) just wanted to spread rumours even after trying hard neither they could pull down deepika nor this film.Just watched chhapaak in second day of release it was amazing got goosebumps nd without any doubt deserve the highest level of awards.As vikrat said it is not easy to be a women like deepika in a country like ours. Also he did a fabulous job. <a href="">#abbadalnahai</a>

I will break the attacker's bones
Kill acid attacker

Salute to the acid attacker! 

Who are watching during corona effect tymBut dis movie doesn&#39;t create any sensational  Y??? 

When Meghna said an actor becomes the character that&#39;s not deepika that&#39;s malti ..&amp; she uses her eyes beautifully .. I really felt that.. Deepika lived the character the voice ,the body language ,the portrayal everything is just perfect .. Hats off to her .. she deserves all the appreciation for this movie.

Everyone actress wants to look more beautiful on the screen but deepika is so brave

Y the fu**ing hell would she do that she could’ve like lost her face forever

They donate nothing for pm care fund

Deepika should get National Award
Oh God 
Deepika deserves a award for Chappak

This woman DEEPIKA PADUKONE  is going to be the next lady superstar of India

Hiii so nice  video
Mad who put acid her face mad  
Aapko.kitni.taklip Hui hogi <a href="">Deepika.is</a> film ke liye I am lucky

Who like laxmi agarwal pihu . Like  please

Our Indian make up artist were not capable of making Deepakas face So Meghna Gukzar had to Appoint a Foreigne make up artist

Deepika was d perfect face for Laxmi they both r very similar in look....Chappak would have done better but at d same time Tanhaji Released n our Indian Viewers chose Tanhaji...

Laxmi sister is really so cute....

Who are seeing movie after saw this video....

Love you deepika beautiful movie
Then I asked her what she was doing.
One like for dipika
1 like for 1 punch to the ones who throw acids 

When an actor/actress get from actor into character thats the magic which happened in this movie 

Hats off to laxmi

<a href="">#छप</a>ाक
The hands of the clock slipped to bring that time
I left home for some important work
There was kohl in the eyes and glow on the face.
The past life was the lesson till now
The sun was very strong, I had a mask on my face.
He couldn't stop the acid coming on his face.
the mascara went inside the eye
My face got burnt without setting it on fire
The failed lover ran away, I remained lying there
I could recognize the devil but I have no eyes
There must be something going on. These were some of the suspicions of the crowd.
There were some eunuchs standing there in human form.
Why did I leave the house? Hey, what did I do?
Why did my face burn? My soul died.
Again the woman was sati, there was a crowd of onlookers.
Should I say it's the fault of the thrower or the acid seller?
It doesn't matter about religion, the bad thing is sake.
Only half of me is left, only half of my face is left.
Real queen is dp️️

I love Deepika Padukone so muchShe&#39;s amazing

She is looking beautiful even in that face

This is why she is called the queen of Bollywood

This movie gives a great message but i don’t consider it great as a movie I was so bored no offense tho

Who is here and who tells me what is the name of this movie? What is its meaning?
That&#39;s why i love Indian movies

CHHAPAAK..This movie surely deserves an OSCAR..

Meghna Guljaar ️Deepu ️ Laxmi ️
I don&#39;t know why people are not going to watch this movie.This is a really good movie . it&#39;s really inspiring. I don&#39;t know what wrong with people why they are not liking this movie. It teaches you how a person has come out from this phase this hard time . It&#39;s really inspiring .plzzzz go and watch plzzzzz zzz zzz zzz

Deepika sucks

She is an incredible actor

It is very shameful and disappointing that in our country many vulger movies and many adult movies and movies promoting drugs and alcohol earn 100 to 200 crores and a movie like chaapak which is a message for the society has earned just 28crores yet. People are boycotting this movie just because deepika joined jnu protest ,it was her personal wise to join the protest and it has nothing to do with her film why can&#39;t people understand .So please I request everyone please watch this movie for the sake of deepikas hard work. Megha gulzar and all the other actors hard work and for all the acid attack fighters.,

I love you deepika! Kudos to your hard work!

Solute of u it is very emotional story.....I really I&#39;m crrying when I see laxmi&#39;s Story

Honestly ,It’s sad to see her How tough time she went through god knows only.Almost every asian country had huge problems with acid attackers back in 1996-2010Specially in our country Bangladesh 🇧🇩 I don’t know about before 1996 But good thing is it has vanished from our society and country.I am very happy about what our govt. has done for girls.That’s why Bangladesh 🇧🇩 is no 1 in gender equality in asia.So change comes slowly but govt needs to take serious action as well to make it more effective.

Well, now it seems that Indians are the only patriots who have made the movie hit.
Boycott chhapaak
I don&#39;t understand why this amazing film got flopped

Fuckoff

I think the resemblance between Deepika and Laxmi is uncanny.. Why does nobody talk about this?

The film is too good and to emotional also I like this film from bottom of my 

Chhapaak should be nominated for Oscar and Deepika should  win  the best actress award

Any one noticed....she still has the RK tattoo on her back neck  <a href="">1:17</a>

I got Goosebumps while watching this...Salute to everyone who related to this movie directly or indirectly ️

salute to depika mam.....
Dipika is very good actor

amazing!
I love dipeeka 
<a href=""> I watched the movie because of the girl who suffered tragic situation. She is so strong.

Big salute for the effert
Hats off deepika mam
Chhapaak is an exceptional film, brought to life by three immensely talented women, @deepikapadukone @meghnagulzar and @atikachohan. This is great cinema, powered by the female gaze, do not miss this.

Love U deepu.and malti

Tukade Tukade gaining ke sardar
There is such a movie that everyone needs to see.
You got a white natural skin in you face 

Oh my God

Grim
Hindu pirodi log 
JNU ne interest nikaal Diya nahi toh what message and what movie yaaro

You are great deepika
Deepika jesi actress no one can do anything but she is the best
she is best...

she is a brilliant actor, she did it very well, only one mistake she did is went to JNU.. If that had not happened this movie was definitely 100cr club movie

Have you seen Rk tattoo?
The angle at which one has to bend to pass gas is Padukone.
You people entered into politics in a film made on such a good issue just for the sake of publicity and earning, in a movie made on a real character, the name of the acid attacker was changed from Muslim to Hindu  
Really one cant even imagine that the acid attack survivors go through..and great job done there to bring a mainstream film on this issue..lots of power to those brave girls and to deepika and meghna to share such a story among all!

Luv u Deepika mam
I think Deepika padukone is not Indian.. she does not hold Indian passport

The best dialogue of Tanhaji in the movie Tanhaji: What will you destroy the saffron..!! The saffron itself flutters in the sky twice every day. Once in the morning before the sun rises, once in the evening after the sun sets. ">#boycott</a>_chhapaak<a href="">#God</a>_India_Ki_Pehchan<a href="">#TanhajiTheUnsungWarrior</a>
Please dub the movie in Telugu

It’s just a pity that I don’t live in India to watch Chhapaak... I hope the entire nation can do that on my behalf cause the movie seems to be nothing but beautiful... 

Till beautiful my bae!♡♡Love u jaan!
Brave beauty️
I think who  don’t like this movie they are not human just not working on box office doesn’t say this is totally flopped imagine just u as a malti  how hard is life going on and this is real story of acid survival who are going through it and this film show society ,country need to changed their thought and they have to show their love to acid survival people

Superb excellent performance. I love this movie.

Great job producer mam laxmi and  LAXMI or deepika sister

I&#39;m Boycotter saw my reason (properly)I can give my blood to her before she went to JNU but know she is nothing for me.<a href=""> Puri dekh KR comment my reply Dena Meri galti ho to btana

Great job, keep it up

The woman who did the Prosthetics deserves all the awards. she did an amazing job. Also it would have been interesting to hear from her as well.

Jnu Jake pura kachra Kar Diya! Lakshmi ki story barbaad Kar di

Those who tried boycot this movie will be in hellSuch a disgustiong people stupidEveryone should nd must watch this moviePlease

Deepika sooo proud of you..i watched this movie i think you put on the right way in this industry ...this is what we waiting for..thankyou love you lot..

Tukde tukde  team member shame on u

Deepika get best actor award   How many agree ?

Deeepikaa u r a star️
Ohhh really loves you dipika U r always my favorite ️

There  are actors whom we love to see on screen and then there are actors like deepika padukon who have surpassed admiration and have gone to the stage of pure respect and love. It is a feeling of utmost gratitude. thank you so so much

Stupid

Chhapaak is the best and Deepika also

Just one thing ruined  this movie to cross 100 crore mark

How could anyone boycott this movie!!!!It&#39;s not about JNU or Deepika , it&#39;s not about any political party, it&#39;s about the vicious thoughts in the minds of misogynists in our country !!!So I urge you all to kindly go and watch the movie and let that brave girl know that we all as a nation are proud of her and the way she handled herself after such a brutal attack and that we stand together in protecting our daughters, sisters, wife and mother against such attacks in the future !!!

I have seen this movie it is very very very nice (in theatre)

Deepika you make me cry!!! I love you eternally! Endlessly ! Always!!?

Please, watch this film

Million billion salutes to deepika mama and chappak team as well

Sorry but magic didn’t happen on Screen! So many people have given their life for the country but I can at least boycott Deshdrohi’s movies 

Publicity stunts for film promotions back fired.. may be movie is good but people not ready to pay for tuku da tukuda batch...

I don&#39;t like deepika personally due to her over reaction but her work in this movie 

This sister has got her face blackened since going to JNU and the movie has also been shot commercially....so now nothing will be achieved by showing the video of her face make up...
This is the art........art of marketing and advertisement.....

There is no Arabic
Kudos
Love u deepu
Brilliant work by whole team of Chhapaak  its a masterpiece created by all of u with so much genuine heart and so much hardwork!!! Loved the movie, loving every behind the scene, interview.... thanku for the awareness and praying that these attacks stop in the mind n then publically 

Well done Clover
thats why I always like deepika

To see that how much effort frm everyone has been putt in this movie  great job to all the team of chhapaak n ofcoures luv u deeps you&#39;re such an inspiration for all of us 

Love you Deepika mem

Or jaoooo JNU

Wow... Whatever is the fate of movie but noone can question Deepika&#39;s acting in this film, it was one of the best performances of the decade.

It was a wrong timing n strategy. But as a film it needs more viewers n appreciation

Extremely beautiful film..

Such an amazing and hardworking team...Keep going

Deepika again proved that she can do it.........It can be anything

How can someone boycott this movie????/.............Don&#39;t they respect women?????............Don&#39;t they have mothers???????

No one is ever really appreciating the actual message in the  film for which deepika has worked so hard....all they care about is JNU....this IS exactly the reason why actors dont come out for protests coz this crazy audience is gonna create a nonsense out of it no matter wht

I am very proud of her......... 
Only Laxmi Agarwal That&#39;s all.

Now this movie is not even a hit but it has to be shown to everyone so that the views are appreciated and supported.
You&#39;re a gem Deepika,lots of love to you

Deepika just not given time to movie she given her soul also..hit like if agree

I liked the idea that the director has shown mostly the positive things malti is doing in the film rather than her pain and not focusing only on attacker’s things... which is very good so atleast these bloody attackers realise that life never stops...

Dipika mam my hard
Feeling sorry for the Director. She deserved more recognition through better earnings.

Amazing movie standing applause for the whole chappak team and d girls suffering out der with dis acid attack

I don’t get it why people want to boycott a film like this. It was beautiful and marvellous. I would encourage people to watch this amazing film. Also kudos to Deepika for such an amazing performance 

Incredible work by chapaak team special Deepika you nailed it

so nice
Deepika is always a best and she deserve the highest paid actress along with her acting skill<a href="">#don</a>&#39;t criticise deepika

best actor in my view 
Is the film worth watching? Please be honest because i have to choose between this film, good newz and tanhaji.

No one: Lit no one:...Deepika: i am CLAUSTROPHOBIC!!

She is absolutely queen of Bollywood

Deepika steal beautiful even with that face ..that&#39;s brof  she has wonderful Sol

0.46omg she still looking deepika laxmi your so beautiful 
Show only jnu

Hats off deepika..ur such a mazing women and inspiration to all

This movie is very good...it empowers us awareness....great job...lovely

The reason for Chhapaak's failure is Deepika's wrong promotion of the movie. Like
Chhapaak is nt very great story.Though it was painful story there are more painful &amp; tragic story than that.Think abt the movi &quot;The least of these&quot; which was based on the Australian missionary &amp; his two sons who were burnt alive by som local members in <a href="">Odisha.It</a> cost them their lives for helping lepers &amp; poor people.

The most dedicated, hardworking and humble actress ever seen in my whole life 

Seriously salute  to my fav actress  deepika mam and chhapaak team... really you guys  done a very good job 
Omg bhut aohka makeup
Nice Deepika 
I hate Deepika ....
Tight slap on Jaahil Chaiwala illiterate <a href="">#NotMyPM</a> <a href="">1:25</a> :- One like for Deepika  
I don&#39;t understand why people dislike

Dipika you r best actores
The film is made on a very good subject and most people should watch the movie, but one wrong step by Deepika (JNU) made the movie flop.
Aur jao jnu politics can not be mixed with art

Ohh god ,so much of hard work, patience hats off to the entire team of chhapak

How someone can boycott such a sensible movie...People should have supported this .....I loved this movie and effort

Deepika Ma&#39;am you are great 

My favorite deepika
Deepika  is wonderful actress  nd strong nd successful..Hell to manipulate indian government

Can we just talk about Lakshmi&#39;s hair?? 

I am feeling sorry for the team of Chhapaak. This movie deserves the best performance at Box office. Plz go and watch it. Watch it for Laxmi Agarwal, at least

Hardwork leads to success

Deepika Mem u are very brave... strong there is no word to describe my emotions and feelings and love for this film

Seriously gave me goosebumps really u r awesome Deepika.

CHAAPAAK best ever film of this year

Amazing job 
Please do not think this is about Malti&#39;s acid-attack trauma and would be painful to watch! Its more about her triumph over what she wanted to accomplish despite her downfalls! This is a must watch film!

This movie is actually appreciable .I watched it  is just heart touching.

Deepika mam.. u r the best..loved it..

Deepika is love ️️ 
Oh my God ........ Deepika worked so hard for this movie ....She is most probably one of the most deserving actresses of Bollywood 

She has ruined the film by standing with tukde tukde gang

My favorite deepu
We love you mam 
Deepika is the best

12th cbse human geography book there??? <a href="">0:41</a>

Hats off to the overall team

Most beautiful thing i have seen by far  this gives a different feeling of magic actually happening

Every one should watch this movie for the hard work of the whole chhapaak team.

<b>Feko the profession and watch the show</b> 
Nice movie but released on wrong time..

Deepika,The Queen of Bollywood️

No matter what the world think about u Deepika mam... U will always be favourite actress.. Lots of love Deepika Mam.. 

Brave lady just not on screen but off screen as well. <a href="">#Respect</a> 

I feel so sorry for the people of India that just because of their immaturity and their stupid decision of boycotting this film they are missing a film which is a milestone in hindi cinema.. Poor bhakts 

<a href="">

These are the only people who dislike me whose makeup is better than cow dung. Our final touch is Modi's famous cream called Modi Poti, right now.
Chaapak deserves the love....... Let&#39;s give it to it! Just because deepika followed her heart... Doesn&#39;t mean the effort of all the Chapak crew should go waste! Amazing film! Loved it! 

Deepika&#39;s best movie!
This is a deepika meghna laxmi vikrant akita Clover appreciation post.... Khudos to the team

I got goosebumps. I literally can&#39;t wait to watch the movie

Now such videos remain viral... Picture is not moving... Now acid is sold... Make up... Make videos etc and bring people to theaters... The path of fools has spread the world.
I cancelled 25 tickets of chhapak after deepika visits JNU and watched tanahaji with my family and relatives

&quot;she uses her eyes beautifully..&quot; ️

Love!!!!!

Hats off dipika i really love her ️

Prosthetic makeup.artist is good..if we can appreciate AB for Paa..we must appreciate Deepika Padukone for this  makeup. please watch Chhapaak for atleast the efforts

Why this beautiful masterpiece is not hit 

Its really an amazin hardwork...she is really awesome....

I don&#39;t known why this film is not to good box office.ache film hai plz go watch.only for some people told boycott the film and many people didn&#39;t watch the film not right. Go and watch this is a social massage movie.

Nowadays it is the beggars who demand more likes than the actual comments on YouTube.
Respekt wow beautiful

ohhh goddd she is rockstar

This film is Great in every term

I condemn what happened to Lakshmi ji and pray that God does not give her any more trouble in life and only keeps giving her happiness, but this Deepika Meghna, all of them are just pretending, they are pretending that only films can be played in JNU, that is why they are like this. Deepika was standing with the wood, who raped the wood because that boy Kanhaiya Kumar was urinating in the open, was doing obscene acts, so he is running his shop by putting Lakshmi ji in front in every promotion, but he is taking advantage. People are not so crazy anymore, the true citizens of the country who passionately respect the country and the girls of the nation, they will oppose it, they start with Dislike and Unsubscribe and one Meghna Gulzar, one who is good does not have to be shown again and again, we are good, he is his own.

One slap of acid  attacker     
There was a girl who was returning from office at night. It was late. This happened for the first time. And there was a lot of work too so I didn't realize the time. She went straight to the auto stand. There was a boy standing there and the girl told him. Seeing this, she got scared that she might fall upside down. Then the boy came near her and said - Sister, you are not my responsibility, it is my responsibility. And until you get a car, I will not leave you and go anywhere. Don't worry. ...An auto driver was passing by there. Saw the girl alone with a boy. Then he immediately stopped the auto and said - Where do you want to go madam?? - Come, I will leave you. The girl sat in the auto. On the way. That auto driver said - You are like my daughter. When I saw you alone so late in the night, I stopped the auto. These days the times are bad, isn't it? And a single girl is not an opportunity, it is a responsibility. Girl. She had reached the area where she lived. She got down from the auto and the auto driver went away. But the girl still had to pass through two dark streets. Had to walk from there…just then a cyclist was passing by…perhaps he too was returning home from work…seeing the girl alone he said – come. ! I'll drop you home…he took a torch with the girl and set out into the dark street…the girl had already reached home. Today someone's daughter or sister had reached home safely. My India is looking for three such people - 1. The boy who was standing at the auto stand. ......2) That auto guy..and......3) The bicycle guy.......The day these three people meet, that day rape will stop in my India. Only then will good days come. And good nights. I swear on your sister, wife or mother, if you do not forward this post to other groups and friends... Mothers, sisters and women are the pride of India. At least win the group in your mobile. please send it
