2005

I was in a big trouble some days ago, my boyfriend of 8yrs and father of our 1yr old daughter continues to mentally abuse me and calls me a lier and cheater all the time and I never have done either. So now I suspect him of cheating then I met a frnd who recommended me to revolutionhacker who gave me access to his text messages, calls and gps location. The bastard was actually cheating on me with some Bitch and I am grateful to revolutionhacker for helping me find out the truth about him. He is very reliable and you can contact him on email at kelvinalanpeterson120@<a href="">gmail.com</a>

This song is fantastic!!

MAH BROTHER WAS BORN ON 2002 :0

This is the best song. Reminds me of my cat who died. 2 years ago. (2018)I once tried to cut myself but the knife wasn’t sharp.Now I stopped trying that. I also wanted to die.Cause the fighting. And deaths you experience.It’s just sad. I really miss my cat. He was the only one on my side.Now we got 3 more pets. A dog, and 2 cats.The dog is the best. It always keeps me happy.I love him. He can bite though he’s still a puppy.But he’s the best. He’s a small teddy bear dog. 🐕 🐶

This is my ringtone, so this feels weird.

Now I got to understand why Anne Marie friendzoned Marshmello😂😂😂

I was born in 2002😊😊😊😊
My favourite song yo

I thought the part, “Oops, I got, ninety nine problems saying bye bye bye” was like, “Oops, I lied, mmm come and say bye bye bye!” 😂

I love you so much and I’m not ciding

Annie I love this but I think you should do it and all I want is that so you can like do it in like games like I have game that I play It&#39;s called gacha life and maybe you could do it there or like any other app that has a game that you can put it on your channel stuff and then we can watch you do it and game mode and I think I would just be a great touch thank you but you can do it if you want to love you the music is amazing keep it up

Hi Anne-Marie!! So I made a song about this but I changed the lyrics, because it was our performance task in math. I hope you&#39;ll be ok about this. Lovely voice, stay strong❤

love anne 💋💋💋💋❤❤❤
Anne-marie is 27 years old now

you are awesome

Me!!

I will always rememberThe day you kissed my lipsLight as a featherAnd it went just like thisBut no, it&#39 ;s never been betterThan the summer of 2002We were only elevenBut acting like grownupsLike we are in the present Well, I guess that was true, like we are now, drinking from plastic cups and singing, &quot;love is forever and ever&quot; Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods of an old Mustang, where we sangSongs with all ours Play that song with your childhood friends. And it went like this, yeah That's how my school days passed Oops I got ninety-nine problems singing bye, bye, byeHold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me Wait, if you're going somewhere, why don't you take a ride with me? Better hit me, baby, one more time But the best thing is to call again and paint a picture for you and me of the days when we were young Singing at the top of both our lungs A picture of that day when I sang out loud from the bottom of my stomach. Now we're under the covers Fast forward to eighteen in bed. We are more than loversYeah, we are all we needWhen we&#39;re holding each otherI&#39;m taken back to 2002I feel like I'm back in 2002 [*]On the day we fell in loveOn the day we fell in loveDancing on the hood in the middle of the woods of an old Mustang, where we sang Songs with all our childhood friends. Oh, now Oops I got ninety-nine problems singing bye, bye, bye “Oops” and “99 problems” and “bye, bye, bye” Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me”Hold up “Because. Along with “ride with me”. Better hit me, baby, one more time But the one that hit me the most was “...Baby one more time” Paint a picture for you and me of the days when we were young Me and you when we were young Let's draw a picture of that day when we sang at the top of our lungs. On the day we fell in loveOn the day we fell in loveOn the day we fell in loveOn the day we fell in loveOn the day we fell in love, love, love ～～～～～～～～～～
