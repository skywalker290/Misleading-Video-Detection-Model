<b>Legendary Animal located</b>

as an australian this is surreal, you&#39;ve some friendly gators there, here, you never feel comfortable with a croc being out of an enclosure, if there&#39;s gonna be a nearby croc,you don&#39;t open business there, you open it where the croc won&#39;t be, there&#39;s NO friendly crossing of paths

Breathing heavy like it’s right next him 

Rest In Peace Dave 

&#39;&#39;That&#39;s a massive Gator, Autobots roll out!&#39;&#39;

The new version of the &quot;Jurasic  Park&quot;...

What a monster, beautiful Alligator! &lt;3

Hey leave the Gator alone. He just wants to put out.

The difference between a crocodile and an aligator? : it's the same caiman
That is a monster

So nobody is going to move it off the golf course 

He is in rdr2

I changed my mind about living in Florida.
I believe that’s chubbs the year is 2024 I hope that big guy is still alive. He’s so big nothing would bother him but he’s got to be over 80 years at this point

2300

It honestly looks like godzilla walking or a dinosaur  walking , specially when it does the high walk ‍️

Now that&#39;s a gator. It&#39;s easily between 14 and 17 feet.

A dinosaur
Thats just my cousin Darlene on her way to work.  Leave her alone.

He got that large from golfers he consumed

The Legendary Bullgator!

I thought this was fake when i first saw it

If your ball hits a gator do you play it where it lands?

That thing is huge !!!

You know that alligator is a man eater



I would run after I took photo if he catches up with you,your in trouble

I just randomly remembered this video and searched “ Dave get next to it for perspective “ 

SCP 682 just broke out at gate b I want all available helicopters and MTF epsilon 11 to gate b now

Alligator grew up on that subpar player diet

I think this just confirms that Florida is a Monster Hunter zone in real life.

The video was posted 7 years ago, but I only saw it now 
Perspective my ass.

Godzilla?
Can i pet that dog

Obviously the guy in the white shirt has never seen mutant animal attack movies.

Missed the opportunity to play the Jurassic Park theme.

He’s just trying to get his steps in for the day 

I love how gators always strut around like they own the place, it&#39;s hilarious

That is the biggest freaking alligator i have ever seen in my life 

That&#39;s looks like a dinosaur
This alligator is the embodiment of modern 16:9 ratio movies. Not tall but long. And what is dave doing? Filming vertical. Why?

Scp 682

are they talking into a fan?

Just a kind dinosaur taking a stroll to the nearest watering hole 

&quot;Gregory use you&#39;re faz-net to catch the faz alligator&quot;

This gator was hired by R* to appear in GTAVI.

You will be able to ride it in GTA 6 

Anyone else come back to this because GTA VI is coming out?

The Gator was almost walking the course as well as Tiger

Damn he&#39;s huge 
I would hate to be the poor bastard who accidentally hits this with a stray ball.

That’s more like a modern Deinosuchus

He’s on video taken from a far, but he still looks huge!!!! I think he’s about 20 ft?!?!

Dave get next to it for perspectiveDave : What!Mr Gator : What!

This size Alligater can run allmost 40 mph.

Dave hug it for perspective!

No Way... Thats gotta be a Comodo Dragon

That thing is gynormous ..!

That&#39;s not an alligator, that&#39;s a fricken dinosaur...

Reminds me of the Legendary &quot;bull-gator&quot; from Red Dead Redemption video game.

Is Lou Bloom behind the camera?

Bruh that thing skipped dinasaur era 

The gator is like dont mind me its lunch time..

I would be crossing the field to get to the water for that reason.
It looks like Serchosukas

Cute little dog 
Huge
Dave, get next to it for perspective. 

Crocs and Gators, Which is Bigger ???

Did you have them come capture him he’s to huge to be free

Two guys in an aligator suit that’s hilarious

That thing looks like a dinosaur!

Closest to a Dinosaur

Worst photogropher EVER….  Learn how to use your zoom… and push your friend closer so we can see scale…  don’t tell him.. PUSH him closer.

just out for a stroll ...
I’m pretty sure that’s a crocodile

&#39;Dave, put your hand in its mouth for perspective.&#39;

I think this is unreal and mechanically put together. It might of helped  me believe it was real, if Dave had got close for prospective 

Bro actually asked bro to get next to a dinosaur for &quot;perspective&quot; 

Bud eats good

Scp 682 has broken at out of the facility

Bro really said &quot;im not small!&quot;

Dude sounds like Steve Blum talking through a box fan

It becomes so much funnier if you put low rider over it

Simply awesome; especially, in this day and age.

Dave get next to it for perspective lol

&quot;get next to it for perspective&quot;

Real life dinosaur
Dave my friend you had one job.

682?

Walking with dinosaurs

I hope Dave knew that gators can, in fact, run and quite quickly, when they feel like it.

For a minute I thought it was real

All you need to do is take this video and then add in Jurassic Park music in the background

That alligators like: &quot;don&#39;t mind me. Just out for a walk.&quot;

GET NEXT TO IT FOR PERSPECTIVE 
Monty must have thought it was monty golf

For all of you perceptively challenged knuckleheads.. <b>when he says: &quot;Dave, get next to it for perspective&quot;— HE’S JOKING you dipshits.</b> You can clearly hear a giggle after he says it. Learn what old-fashioned dry sarcastic humor is

He said get next to it for perspective 

dave suck its toes for perspective

Welcome, To Jurassic Park.

OMG that looks positively like a dinosaur!! Is this real or some computer generated fake??

I&#39;ve never seen such a gigantic alligator. Is that an alligator or a Crocodile . And that big guy is in Florida ?!!

Guess Godzilla left his clubs home

Camerman you need to get closer to the gaiter, for perspective of course.  What are you taping Dave anyways ?

BEHEMOTH!!!!!!!

&quot;leave me alone. I&#39;m old.&quot;

“Dave, get next to it for perspective” should be the caption for Gary Larson Far Side cartoon…

SCP 692 JUST BROKE OUT AT GATE B I WANT ALL HECICOPTERS AND MTF UNITS TO GATE B NOW I REPAET SCP 682 IS OUT OF THE FACILITY ALL HELICOPTERS AND MTF UNITS TO GATE B NOW

Dam Leatherhead. 

and everyone else downplays it and let 14 footers be the record.  that&#39;s a freaking dinosaur

Incredible, what a monster! I feel like I&#39;m watching Jurassic Park. Such an amazing sight, to be on a golf course looking at one of the largest alligators in the world, or possibly the largest gator. Looks like he&#39;s just out for a leisurely stroll to a different pond.

It’s like a dinosaur, if only they’d throw in some meat or something tasty. 
An Alligator can run very fast.  This is not a pet, but a man eating hunters prize.  Not too long ago, a woman walking her dog was killed by one of these.  She lived next to the Golf Course.

holy hell, i think that&#39;s the closest to a real life dinosaur anyone would ever get to see

Yeah Dave... Get inside it for perspective!

Is That Gator For Reals?

Jesus!  That thing is as big as a dinosaur.  A small dinosaur.   I&#39;d laugh if that &#39;gator made a break for Dave.  He wouldn&#39;t have a chance.

&quot;Don&#39;t mind me, just taking a walk&quot;

The Deinosuchus does not existDeinosuchus:

That&#39;s a posh Lacoste golf cart lol.

Dinosaurs confirmed, take that church 

This a sacosuchus

That is a huge alligator, as big as a large saltwater crocodile.. this monster is damn near 2000 pounds

Dave, try to get a picture from inside it&#39;s stomach.

ain&#39;t no way bruh

Two impressive things in this video :-The gator-The most impressive talking helicopter impression I’ve ever seen

Never listen to a camera man who has everything to gain with the shot but nothing to lose they never die.

“mom can we watch jurassic park”jurassic park at home:

Gators miss their golf playing bodies and days. Relax, if they wanted to eat you, they’d be right up your ass chasing you down the course

Sure its not an American or Nile Crocodile?

I’d shoot that thing. It shouldn’t exist

Honestly these guys were lucky that alligator was chillin. They must have been packing some serious freakin heat in their golf bags to be acting so cavalier about it because that alligator is freakin huge. If that alligator wanted them for dinner it would have lt. You wouldn&#39;t be able to out run it with it that close. Not one that big. I don&#39;t think they understood how fast a full grown alligator is. In and out of the water.

Dave get to it for perspective! Folks whaaaaaat ?

I tthought it was a dibasaur

For the faint of heart, please do not watch 
Dave should re-evaluate his friendship with the camera guy

Good wor2k!. love it
That&#39;s a dinosaur wth

Jurassic Park 4 got leaked I see

And you think he didn&#39;t ear you ? Two stupid on the pitch.

Welcome to Jurassic Park

Scary, but kinda majestic. Good for the floridians to respect such a creature, I mean they could cull them but they don&#39;t.

The filmers voice lol

&quot;yo dave , get next to it for perspective&quot; &quot;ayo dave, put your head in its mouth for perspective&quot;

He said Im looking for someone&#39;s balls.

I’ve watched enough Steve Irwin ((RIP) dealing with Crocs and Gators and seen plenty of gigantic ones but this guy wins.. Incredible!

wow jurrasic  gator  ,, nature miracle   ,god bless

Waiting for ace Ventura to pop out it’s butt.

<i>Dave, Dave get next to it for perspective</i>french voice : twelf seconds latoer<i>DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVE</i>

No actually a deinosuchus

That’s a sarcosuchus at this point

OH SH-

So scientists knows now huge alligators live in florida

Disliked, Dave didn&#39;t get close enough for &quot;Perspective&quot;

Dave: tell me you don’t give a shit about me without telling me you don’t give a shit about me.Dave’s Friend : Get next…

Dinosaurs aren’t all extinct. Wow what a sight.

“Dave Get next to it for perspective”“How about you get bent”

The hell is this android voice?

SCP-682 HAS BROKEN OUT OF THE FACILITY

As soon as dude walks up you get a better idea of how big it is

Deinosuchus has returned!

Like a scene from Jurassic Park! Like a Toyota with teeth!

That’s a boss battle right there.

Drop it in the Rio Grande at the southern border.

Average day in florida

that&#39;s a crocodile, Alligators can´t walk over their bodies, and yes, also crocodiles that big are pretty common

Godzilla
Florida&#39;s fucking wild man

No one walking close by very dangerous.....
Ta Ta look around there safety and security media internet certainly yes


I would like to see Dave&#39;s recording of that alligator.

Why sounds like he&#39;s talking in front of a level 3 intensity fan 

Walking like a rare spawn in classic WoW.

That&#39;s a fuckin&#39; dinosaur

That’s an American crocodile most likely

Majestic.
Why did I just laugh for 10 minutes straight listening to his friend say Dave get next to it I cant with Dave’s friend like tht is literally the biggest alligator  anyone has ever saw and he wants Dave to get next to it 

SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent and was observed to engage in complex communication with SCP-079 during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment.



SCP-682 has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its form. SCP-682&#39;s physical body grows and changes very quickly, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds material. SCP-682 gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic. SCP-682&#39;s regenerative capabilities and resilience are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with its body 87% destroyed.

Holy hell that’s a dinosaur

BIG PAULI,,,,

the dinosaur that survived

Most interesting thing that happened in that golf field

<a href=""> also came to our house

I apologize that was his first time escaping were from the south side

I wonder if gator is Trump golf course security hey madcow Rachel Maddow maybe gator will think your on his lunch menu hopping

Rise of the beasts speech spoiler lads!

That’s a dinosaur.

Its not a problem when humans play golf, when i do it however its a major problem

It&#39;s a strange feeling like watching a giant monster movie, but it&#39;s real-life and the giant monster exists in reality.

These animals are quite common in this region, which coincidentally is swampy. Some say they appear in the summer, so if you live in a Florida mansion, you might be surprised to see an alligator lounging in your pool or strolling through your grass.

That&#39;s the lanLORD of the golf course.

They&#39;re gonna need a bigger lake.

Bro just another day in Florida

Looks like an animatronic from Jurassic Park.

&quot;Dave, get next to it for perspective&quot;- Dave&#39;s best friend 2016 -

WOW!!! A modern-day dinosaur!
Dinosaurs run from this dude🇺🇲🇺🇲
It has to be Florida, of course

Welcome to Jurassic Park.

&quot;Dave get next to it for perspective.&quot; 

Good thing it&#39;s a Gator. Had that been a Croc, the appropriate response would have been, &quot;Kill the frak out of it right now.&quot;

a real life dinosaur!
Gator: wow what a beautiful Nature, i am so happy to walk and see these beautiful view.

Yeah Dave,get next to it!!‍️
Im sick and tired of seeing things likeHollywood CGsWho said this is it

very deadly very terrible reminds me of the movie Jurassic Park

Is this guy talking into a fan ?

Imagine if it starts galloping

It probably been alive for a long long time

Lacost

As big as this one is, I&#39;ve seen one that was even bigger (and by a significant amount too).  A lot of people underestimate how huge American Alligators can grow.  It&#39;s rare to see them, but they are out there.

&quot;get next to it for perspective&quot; lmaoooo

He was just taking a walk across the golf course

Well the gator wasn&#39;t bothering anyone obviously

Backstory…. Dave had been a bit of an asshole earlier in the day. (The Farside come to life)

Get next to it For perspective.‍️
Is it me or does that alligator have swag?? Badass mf right there 

Boston dynamics....
You certainly wouldn&#39;t walk up to Sherman and penalise him for,slow play

Bros speaking in 00101011001
I think its at least 13 feet in lenth

Damn, I hit the ball right against the edge of the water, again!

So this came up as I was looking the difference between alligators and crocodiles, and according to my newfound surface level knowledge this is a crocodile : huge size, thick end of the tail, tan head and visible lower fourth teeth. An I wrong?

how long (in feet) is that alligator?

Fake

This man is speaking a fan-language

This is a very well-made fake video.

The Real Jurassic Park !

Thats a freaking dinosaur

Is that a bull gator?

See You Later Alligator

That is fucking confidence, he fuckin&#39; <b>knows</b> no one is gonna do anything.

That’s the gator from rdr2

ah yes, the average wildlife in florida.

<a href="">0:01</a>

If there are any kids on that golf course I pray that their parents have enough foresight to keep a tight grip on their hands. With all of these shows these days depicting dinosaurs as our friends they might be inclined to go running up to it to pet it!

It&#39;s like a glimpse into Jurassic Park
fucking dinosaur is that croc still alive??.

That thing definitely was on its way to fight kong

ay is dat the red dead 2 alligator???

Scp-682 is NOT to be approached until an mtf unit has been dispatched.

&quot;Get next to it for perspective&quot;Yeah, perspective for new friends

Do they know how fast they can run? The gator could have reached that guy in the white shirt before he could turn around and make it 2 feet. What an idiot.

A typical day in Florida lol

That’s fucking Godzilla
“Steve! Get the .50 cal …. ”

Can&#39;t even go near the water on a golf course in Florida....

I just searched for &quot;Dave get next to it for perspective&quot;  and YouTube brought me here.

What&#39;s the difference between a Gator and a Crocodile?

&quot;Dave, put your head inside gator&#39;s mouth for perspective&quot;

Dave, put your head inside gator&#39;s mouth for perspective

It&#39;s a dragon without wings

When Colombus reached the Coast of Florida, this Alligator was already there

Can you believe that 70 Million years ago, alligators used to be twice that size? Imagine seeing a 10 to 12 meter long croc such as Deinosuchus walking through a field. It really would have been a sight to behold.

It&#39;s a monster, no doubt, but somethings off with modern cell phone perspectives that tinkers with the distance/size gestalt.

That’s a good boy right there.

You can&#39;t tell by the way I use my walk I&#39;m a woman&#39;s man

When you’re playing golf and a literal dinosaur walks by.

That&#39;s a cool dog.

do you people not realize how quickly that gator can turn and come after you?

15ft is below average size for an australian crocodile.

SubtitleBob: &quot;That&#39;s the biggest freaking aligator i ever seen in my life...&quot;Bob: &quot;I think she must be 15ft long...&quot;Dave: &quot;You gotta be kidding me...&quot;Bob: &quot;Have you ever seen that before?&quot;Dave: &quot;No...&quot;Bob: &quot;It&#39;s too giant for aligator...&quot;Bob: &quot;Dave get next to it for perspective...&quot;

Alligator was so big the dude transformed into a decepticon

What the heck, why is it so big….

Looks like someone wants to get eaten 

Is there a dovahkiin in the house?

He took Chubb&#39;s hand.

Using Dave as bait in order to buy time and run away... brilliant move sir

This looks like a scene from Jurassic Park.

How to train your dragon and Jurassic park

Cue the Dr Livesley music

Oh my goodness 

Alternative title: &quot;Motivational speaker inspires Dave to leave the comfort zone&quot;

This animal has a right to be there. Your bewilderment is astonishing on  how ignorant you are about nature. That is why your sport must be eradicated no land should be use for golf. Or any other human immoral activity!.

<b>Narrated by Optimus Prime</b>

Fake

Quick Dave!! Jump on his back. I need a picture

That&#39;s bowser.... Where the F is mario?

Florida man : Finally, a worthy opponent !

These people are crazy, you should never get that close. They would have you for lunch,

Gator : &quot; Today is a good day to play golf &quot;

Antediluvian!

Dave, make sure you have your track shoes on because those mothers are fast when they want to be!!! 

that thing is HUGE

That’s Dino!

Guy talks like he&#39;s describing an important putt.

No Dave&#39;s were injured during the filming of this video.

Gator Bro needs to get somewhere

That specific alligator has live for many, many centuries.

Walking like the godz they are

Dino Gator. Probably fake.

Here I thought my cell phone was glitching.

Yeah... That&#39;s why we live in South Beach I have yet to see a giant alligator like that walk down Lincoln Road...The rest of Florida is beautiful but there are too many encounters like these...My wife is originally from Tampa and she once found an alligator standing up against the door of her apartment in a condo...

Alligator just wants to play some golf.

Holy macaroni!

This is why when my sister said &quot;come to Florida, it&#39;ll be fun&quot;, and suddenly &quot;No&quot; became an entire sentence for me.

The land that time forgot....

The Gator is taking a Stoll in his back yard.

It just ate a golfer.

Doesn&#39;t even look real
That ain’t no gator,that’s a dinosaur

Alien sees this, I would love to see it&#39;s reaction.

It would be enough to change the golf course and let the crocodiles live in peace
Narrator to Dave: some of you may die, but it&#39;s a sacrifice I am willing to make.

Wow, the alligator was so big that it somehow added a helicopter effect to the cameraman’s voice. Incredible.

What do they eat? How could it hide for so long?

&quot;Get next to it for perceptive &quot; Yea, right 

What a cool lizard!
Gator was just chilling have a nice walk and enjoying the lovely golf course. It may pop over to Dave for a lovely snack.

whats wrong with audio

C&#39;mon man,  you got golf clubs - go beat it to death!

Go infront of his mouth do a selfie . It will be cool.

That&#39;s the Del Lago from the Resident Evil 4 game!!

Aaaah, a huge crocodile is parading around the golf course
it ate all the skinny golfers?  only the old fat ones left??

I think the gator was trying to figure out how far it was from one hole to the next.

Yeah, I would definitely let Sherman play through.  

Holy fuck

In the old JAWS movie,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         &quot;Foreground my ass&quot; is what Chief Brodie told Hooper when he asked him,                                                                                                     &quot;Could you go to the end of the pulpit please?

The only thing that woulda been better is if the croc blasted a huge pile of shit all over the golf course....could you imagine having to clean up gator shit....God that&#39;s gotta be KNAR.  Like you know how pot roast smells if you leave it in the fridge or the crock pot to long.....so yeah, like a corpse&#39;s rotten anus just the worst shit you could imagine...on the green...just right there to left of the sand trap by hole 6.

Ah yes Florida.....

everyone gangsta until that gator hears a chirping sound

Somebody jump on his back and go for a ride!

Average golf course in Florida:

only in florida man

Look closely you gullible assholes. Too many uniform and repetitive movements. Plus lighting does not match the scenery and the alligator is comically large. Grow some brains.

Did u guys sign up the autobots as the cameraman/reporter?

I dont think that’s a croc, it’s a dino!!

John Cena??

what&#39;s scarier . . . that they saw the GIANT alligator . . . or that they COULDN&#39;T see the giant alligator after it crested that hill

That is why any US civilian should own an Anti Material Rifle at 12.7mm

And them some man beats the alligator to death because it’s…<b>FLORIDA MAN</b>

Dave get in it&#39;s mouth to test the bite force.

Why when it&#39;s just someone it&#39;s &quot;Florida Man&quot; but when it&#39;s a huge ass gator the size of the moon, it&#39;s not &quot;Giant Florida Alligator&quot;?

The only SCP that exists.

What the people were saying if you couldn’t catch itGuy 1: Jesus they must be 15 feet longGuy 2: you got to be kidding meGuy 1: Have you ever seen something that bigGuy 2: No, never Guy 1: I think that’s two guys in an alligator suitGuy 1: Dave get next to it for perspective Guy 1: holy crap

If they chase you run zigzag, supposedly alligators have a hard time running zigzag 

Welcome to Florida

Dinosaur 
That’s one big aligator

If this giant runs after you he will catch you wherever you are careful
I think it&#39;s crocodile, not alligator.

thats huge

This result when animals fight each other they double size.

Dinosaur !
Friend: Dave get next to gator for perspective, I will go viral.

Who called Optimus prime to stop the gator

What&#39;s up with the voice? Is the cameraman sitting inside a helicopter?

Cameraman shaking so much out of fear that even his voice is vibrating

Scp 682

The fact that the camera is so far away, yet the alagator is still this big, would of made me get away from this location ASAP, just in case this thing came with friends, and they&#39;re just lagging behind.

That is almost exactly like the first case you play in the CSI Miami PC game. An alligator was found dead on the field of a golfing club.

has this ever been debunked as fake or confirmed as being real? i still can&#39;t believe how massive that thing is.

Chillest croc ever.

seems like scp 682 has breached the facility

SCP 682 be like:

Welcome to... Jurassic Park*cue theme song

Dinosaurs are extinct, no they aint.

That’s one god blessing 20 footer American holy water blessing yards of rattlesnake

I can believe these guys are the ancestors of dinosaurs.

Postasuchus from walking with dinosaurs

I better stay in that lake, I don't walk, I don't even think about that lake where that beast is, at least that's Gustavo Primeva.
WELLLCOMMMME....... TO JURASSIC PARKKKKKKK

Two guides in the alligator suit ! 

Wow , it&#39;s so big !!!!!

Fun fact... Alligators never stop growing, the only way most of them die is through poaching, starvation or physical damage. The only time gators die of old age is in captivity.

“Dave, put your head in its mouth to get perspective!”

Scp 682

That&#39;s a dinosaur 
Looks fake

Lacoste
Florida is different i swear

Big guy, bet this alligator is fairly old. Amazing creatures for sure.

Dave get next to it?!!?!? 

No, you scientists say dinosaurs are extinct.
Is that an Alligator or a Crocodile?

Optimus prime is shook when he saw a big ass gator

He did not know where to go 

Even an elephant would eat it up
Glad I don’t live there those people who go there are crazy it’s either they remove those giant alligators or don’t go there at all they will kill you alive the only reason nobody got killed is cause they are slow they can’t run very fast and catch us

Why is everyone so shocked that he told Dave to get close to it? What were you expecting? Since when do robots have emotions?

What is so big?
‍‍‍‍‍ habahibiejibbies

Anunnaki.

Wow, it’s so big, isn’t it a dinosaur?
Alligator itself knew it had add some spice on the golf court.

Wow it looks like dinosaur

【insert Jurassic park theme】
Dragons are fake alligator hold my beer

Closest experience we can get to witnessing a dinosaur.

He walk like ‘come on capture me’

It&#39;s real?

Good to see an alligator appreciate a game like golf

There’s no way this is real. It looks fake as hell. It’s walking way too consistent to be real.

Lol everyone came here for the giant gator but got actually shocked with the &quot;Dave, get next to it for perspective&quot;; what a true friend

No, I gatore and Normandiano, you Reichführer-SS not my Fuhrer
Disclaimer : There&#39;s nothing wrong with your speaker.

IMO playing Golf is great Watching it is a SNOOZEFEST like Baseball

Looks like a dinosaur
Maybe its not real coz too big

Jurassic Park

Nowadays swag is common in Animal kingdom

So this is what my life has come to haan. Just laying around watching a gator walk at 1mph.

That wasn&#39;t a gator that was a T-Rex walking on all fours.

Just a crocodile the size of a dinosaur crawling across a golf course.....no problem!

Wow this is so scary
Cue jurassic park theme....dana dan dan dan
What is a dinosaur?
The lack of skill to perceive danger is really concerning for me

It’s nice that we finally view helicopter as a gender in society! But we still need to work on calculator!

oh that alligator just looking for a hug

We miss dinosaurs 
this can not be real omfg its like jurassic park

When you truly hate the other guy&#39;s guts you will tell him to &quot;get next to it for perspective!&quot; ‍️

Any golfers missing? Yikes. I would not be standing in plain sight of that.

Giant Gator taking a walk:30 million people: interesting

Don&#39;t be panic man!I need vitamin D. 

Must be nice to be able to waste hundreds of dollars a week on something as dumb as this. The rest of America has to work their asses off, always one check away from tossed out of house and home and these schmucks throw money away on a long walk they could take for free at their local park. Jokes on them. 

What&#39;s with the choppy ass audio?

I would not want a enemy if i have Dave&#39;s friend

If my friend asked me to get closer he would get my perspective alright.

that is a dinosaur

Dynasaurs now a days barely go out for shopping.

T rex 

Now it's a dinosaur
Is it normal for these types of living dinosaurs to walk by as if nothing had happened? or is it the golf &quot;park&quot; mascot?

is that venom speaking?

If dinos cmin back it&#39;s from Florida.

<b>*Dave get next to it for perspective*</b> 

Thats a fu*** dinosaur

It is wallygator xD

That not a gator its a fuckin godzilla

That’s not a gator bro, that’s a salt water crocodile ‍️

put Jurassic park theme on top of this.

Put one in prison and make the other disabled, the third and fourth may come to their senses.
Scp 692 just broke out gate b. I want all available mtf units at gate b now. I repeat scp 682 is out of the facility.

Get next to it for perspective.. 

&quot;Stayin alive&quot; plays in the background where ever that beast goes.

He want to learn Golf... That&#39;s the Main reason....

There is no God except Allah, prophet Muhammad is the messenger of Allah ️Jesus (Peace be upon him) never said that he is God, the Quran says:And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, “O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as deities besidesAllah ?&#39;” He will say, “Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen. 117. I said not to them except what You commanded me – to worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. 118. If You should punish them – indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them – indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. (Holy Quran 5:116-118) .

Just what the hell does that gator eat near a golf course to get that big?!

He is very huge

This is the closest we&#39;ve got to a dinosaur.

The draconians wanted to enslave humans feeding off their pain/negative energy n created the reptilians a bit larger than this, killed the dinosaurs to replace them and reign over mankind. I myself had one in my house trying to attack me but I saw many coming off the water in a Tsunami video and weirdly nobody else saw but one person saw 1. They get denser under very painful happenings such as war, floods, where there&#39;s death n destruction. They&#39;re humanoid so longer paws than this. Literally I know them and I&#39;m mindblown most ppl don&#39;t see what&#39;s in front of their eyes. It&#39;s tough to see human kind living poorly because who knows the truth gets ignored and they continue being ruled by these bad guys :(

Just another normal day in Florida

Dave&#39;s friend just wanted to win the game of golf.

The real Land owner is inspecting his property..

Dinasor 

I still come back to this clip just to admire just how massive this Gator is

That&#39;s cgi

Alligator be like : &quot;You guys carry on playing golf&quot;

Jesus Christ that thing is fucking massive

Dinasour

That’s why I don’t wanna go to Florida.

Reminds me of Bull gator from Red Dead Redemption 2

Does such a big crocodile exist?
jurassic park
That gator is just happily chilling 

Bigger better more meat lol
That&#39;s ain&#39;t no gator my friend, That&#39;s a freaking Lake Placid

Is that CGI?

Playing golf in Florida. You have the sand traps and lakes. Then you have the alligators the size of dinosaurs wandering around.

The sound is like: &quot;I&#39;m a bbbbaaad guuuuyyyy&quot;. Alligator: Duh

I&#39;m the Boss

<a href="">0:18</a> Imagine if he really thought it was just two guys in a gator suit and walking next to the animal asking &quot;Wow, what a nice suit, were did you get it from?&quot;

Put a saddle on that and go for a wild ride.

Eating people ㅠㅠ

Why would Optimus Prime be scared of an alligator?

Should kill the monster

The commentator sounds more like an alligator

Dino still exist....

Bigger than a fish
That’s called a dinosaur.

Whats that gators name?

Americans are so dam two guys in a suit, you people really make fools out of yourself.

Back in my country, that gator will become lunch and dinner.

Dude, this thing is seriously like something out of Jurassic Park. That is a monster gator!

Let you golfers EAT = no sense from you 0000000000000000000000000.1
Alligators can briefly hit 35 mph running.  I&#39;m not approaching one.

Btw who is Dave??

Friend, how disturbing. I feel a nervous twitch as if the crocodile is going to run towards people at some point: v
The voice is very creepy, it looks like the voice of &quot;Jigsaw&quot; :U

I thought SCP-682 was fictional

Gator be like hello, that was some big bang (asteroid)I&#39;m looking for an old buddy he goes by T- Rex kinda looks like me, but way way bigger and flies around. Meanwhile.....&quot;Hey Dave get closer for perspective&quot;, ill stay over here and zoom in for the picture.. lmao

Eat ye up real quick size of him ffs!

Let him play through!

Dave is going to be a brunch for perspective

He&#39;s been feeding on humans 

This alligators name is little Johnny and he belongs to tiger woods. Back in 1989 woods adopted little Johnny

Golf sports gets investment not because of his boringness but due such appearances of predators

It&#39;s a Great White landshark!

Learn and Change. You are the Invaders!

This is Sherman. He’s incredible. He walks across the golf course every day and never harms a soul.️

So dinosaur didn&#39;t fully extinct

Typical beta male behavior.&quot;I gotta film this gator so I can show this to my other beta friends to show them how cool I am&quot;Everyone else, ow look the same animal in the fucking zoo, you idiot.

nice to know that drogon went to florida after burning the iron throne

“Welcome to Jurassic park”

that&#39;s a flat dragon

That&#39;s a fricken dinosaur

Respect nature &amp; wildlife. Leave him alone, he deserves to be here. I wish he was at a Zoo and protected from the golfers! He looks like a hungry, majestic animal!

Welcome to..Jurassic Park

Greatness

Jurassic Park

Fake

Might have a human in him

This is fake

He is only looking for the lavatory.

He&#39;s speaks directly on a air fan.

Are there alligators that big or is it fake

In golf, there are lots of social assistance land crocodiles, that's normal
Donkey Kong apparently came to second summer in Florida... Cos that&#39;s K&#39;Rool.And Dave is gonna be an NPC in the next game.

Another regular day, here in Florida.

I thought I heard concern in his stutter when Dave went ahead, then he delivered the iconic..

looks like a robot aligator

I&#39;m guessing they don&#39;t know how fast gators can run.

Do you wana be that close!? That thing looks fast

Was the guy not too close? I thought alligators are capable of running pretty quickly.

That ain’t no gator, that’s a freakin dinosaur

Fake?

&quot;Where is that alligator going?&quot;&quot;Anywhere it damn well pleases.&quot;

Is this real???

Now THAT&#39;S a  Hazard!
Another day at Caeli… i mean, Florida

Thats a big fuckin gator
