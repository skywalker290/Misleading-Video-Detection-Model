The last good meme of an era; it all ending in 2020

Link

I know you went with the new mix firl yesterday. So i will not try to keep it or try to get it back. Not sure what it means for you and me but you should know what I am really like.

all asian ppl look the same to me

All those K Pop guys look like girls they aren&#39;t &quot;handsome&quot;

schadenfreude

<a href="">10:06</a> TIL Hey Arnold was a comic.

Hi

<a href="">7:20</a> HE IS COMPARING CULTURES AND ESPECIALLY WITH ASIAN CULTURE, HE IS A RACIST N***II know that most of you get but for the sake of idiots, this is a joke

Nah, pewdiepie is naturally handsome so its worth it he gets voted

<a href="">2:15</a> the guy on the right didn&#39;t have a beard that&#39;s why 

I miss the little song he used to play during this era in the background

News but there is no debate

One of the reasons I hate k-pop fans

Newdiepie pews

I think you should not be in top 1000 also

9

I have to disagree a year later lol. What Ive learned is that its VERY normal to act that way, and wish illegal misfortune to someone you don&#39;t like. Its actually been happening all through time. The real answer is its not right. Its normal, but not correct behavior.

Clickbait

It would be cool if ya did

BRUH PEWDIEPIE IS SO OVERRATED

Pew news back pls

<a href="">0:40</a>WHERE ARE THE STAYS IT&#39;S DISAPPOINTING felix should react to felix XD

Why does Poopy think he’s Pewds

Who else in 2020 when he won THE MOST HANDSOME GUY<a href="UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/8i7lXtSGFuCBx_APxOOy2Ac"></a>

And now he&#39;s number 1, richly deserved

Felix do u wanna try stanning stray kids hehe *me waits for another felix x felix interaction

Hey you did it!

First comment of 2021

How the f**k is somebody gonna hit hundred million in ten years what

pewdiepie after talking about himself in third person and as a different person : My goals are beyond your understanding

OMG I THINK LEE FELIX WILL BE SCREMING BECAUSE PEWS SAID HIS NAME AHHHHHHHHH

<a href="">0:58</a> it’s true

I came here to check Lee Felix being mentioned after Hyun-jin being mentioned

But like imagine Pewdiepie hearing how deep Felixs voice is.His soul would leave his body.

is anyone here now that he won 1st?

I&#39;m a kpop stan also love pewds who&#39;s with me ♡

Congratulations most handsome man 2020!

This is more of a podcast. About YouTube things.

<a href="">0:37</a> yey stan stray kids for clear skin and good grades

&quot;Welcome to Peru news&quot;    - Subtitles

<a href="">2:03</a> that’s is me LOL

Lee Felix was 69, my internal 9 year old is shAKIng

Funny how hypocritical alot of those salty stans are. Also, Felix was always handsome though? And his recent pictures even prove it more now.

Pewdiepie is rich!

I

Is it like an inside joke pretending this tall blond blue-eyed Swede with a strong jawline and generally inoffensive features... is ugly? Just because he dresses like a sleepy teenager? Sorry I’m a new sub lol

I&#39;m sorry, not trying to disrespect Marzia or nothing but Felix is actually handsome... like... he&#39;s hot why are people weird about it?

Imagine how hurt he must have been,like its just,disgusting to see ppl getting jealous of HIS earnings,HIS fans, HIS fame and its not like he asked anyone any help to start his channel.HE started it alone. SO JUST LET HIM BE , HE WORKED HIS WAY HERE

Maybe you shouldnt include makeup on the list,its about natural beauty,  not the makeup..

Alright who wrote the comic I’m just curious nothing I say is gunna change anything

Felix?Is that you?Did Felix just mention you?

Ugly: pewdipie with blue natural eyes and honest man.Handsome: artificial nose colorful hair and obviously a puppet

I wish the media would stop portraying him as an awful guy he did a bad thing we get it now he s past it

Yay he is a handsome guy he deserved it

He doe be handsome

You made 45mil not 54 lol  ( Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg known online as PewDiePie is an English-based Swedish YouTuber, comedian, gamer, and philanthropist, known primarily for his Let&#39;s Play videos and comedic formatted shows. As of 2020, PewDiePie net worth is $ 45 million making him the richest Youtuber in the world. )

So how much is he actually worth

Pewdiepie: ExistsMedia: Pewdiepie makes fun of dead people

I am in Disney

<a href="">0:40</a> when your name is already a username

stan skz and pewdiepie!

Y

Honestly none of the K-POP people should make the list. They literally look like they&#39;re trying to be girls, not guys

Who is this guy?

11/4/2020

does he know Gloria Borger moved to CNN

I just don&#39;t get it! I really can&#39;t differentiate between the guy who secured #1 in that list and the guy who secured #69 on the same list! I mean, they all look the freaking same!!!

Who noticed his Mic is flying.......

Identify theft is not a joke Poppy Smoria, millions of simps suffer every year

Their favorite kpop guy has the face of a chick. Not handsome. Attractive to some but not handsome

He&#39;s handsome and funny, basically he is perfect

I am laughing watching this :D

Lee Felix top 69Everyone: nice

Nah he isn&#39;t ugly,  at least he doesn&#39;t depend on makeup and skincare to look handsome

&quot;I&#39;m not quitting YouTube!&quot;Everyone: <b>happiness noises</b>

I miss Poppy Smoria… I haven&#39;t seen him in a longass time.I hope she&#39;s okay…

I love how his background has a watermark!!

So I told my mum that pewds has 107 MIL follower and I showed him to her and she was like :damnnnnn he cute

<a href="">1:51</a> maybe it’s because pewdiepie’s face is natural yet already beautiful? Idk....

im kinda late but like as a kpop stan im honestly DISAPPOINTED in people who made fun of his look. honestly i think hes very good looking and better than the people who made fun of him 

I miss poppy smoria

I&#39;m still waiting for recardo to be the most handsome guy in 2020

Did New Guy die from Covid-19? Sad sad days.. :(

Never forget that he can bait us using his own name

Poopy Felix

wait he has gotten into this 5 times?

BTS IS HANDSOME (duh)PEWDS IS HANDSOMEIM AN ARMY AND A BRO its so crazy that other armies were mad like it was literally anything.

This guy is gaey

Low key miss pew news

<a href="">2:11</a> is that even a guy on the right

Felix is really handsome. Idk why they hating T.T

I hate this motherflipping media ! Like seriously?!?!? DAMN !!

damn I got baited

It&#39;s not just all face you need to be funny and handsome

OneyNG.. my heartsweet

Wait....So how much does he actually make?

I do not hate kpop,i&#39;m a fan of a few of the bands back then. I still think the songs are amazingBut let&#39;s face it here, felix is more handsome than jungkook.

Anyone remember when he got 18?

hmm..

How is this 8 months ago?

I unironically think pewds has a very defined, manly face. All those kpop stars look like women.

floating mic go brr

god k-pop ultimate stans are so toxic.

Pewds is a hottie

They look the same. Those are the same people. The same picture.

i love new guy

who say pewdiepie is handsome i&#39;m ganna kill you

So handsome

lol, K pop stars should have their most beautiful list, then men can have the most handsome list. Simple. most look like girls with coloured hairs, I just dont get them. Is that masculine in Korean culture? And do you have to be beautiful to be a k pop star? It&#39;s just a weird subculture. More like religion....

PUNUS

I will never vote any Korian or k-pops.I will vote Pewdiepe,Shawn Mendes,Harry Styles and Robert Pattinsonn.

According to scientist Robert Pattinson has the most perfect face.

That&#39;s a guy on the right? Thought it was a chic. Why would an Asian even be on the list? They all look alike.

Can i have small lone of 1 million? Plz?

Watching this video now. We need New Guy now more then ever.

New guy : 2020 is going to be the bestCovid 19: are you sure about that

To the people that are confuse why he&#39;s on top 2 U guys as have SMALL BRAIN.....

Bring back gloria borger

amtv

Just to make it clear, there&#39;s a difference between Kpop FAN and Kpop STANThese people are probably kids and they don&#39;t define us, we&#39;re not that insane. Can&#39;t one just be a 9 year old and like Kpop in peace or do i have to suffer-

2040 pewdiepie: im gonna end tgis man whole career

as a jungkook ult biased multi, pewds deserved #1.

А кто-нибудь еще работает с Дзеном через EnotZen ?

Number 1 should have been shrek

am poppy lwiay poppy gloria WhAt pewds laughing in the back ground what are looking at poppy am looking at india pewds looking at mr beast how does mr beast make this much money nani

I love your intro pewds

Man his accent really hit hard now

It is so heartless of people to think because someone has a lot of money they can&#39;t feel negative emotions about anything. It&#39;s just like saying because I don&#39;t have very much money that I can never be happy. I have missed meals before and still enjoyed life, money isn&#39;t everything.

يا شباب مين عربي

Finally! My two worlds collided. My Swedish King and My Aussie King! Also the list is 100% correct cause Jeon Jungkook is the most gorgeous man alive

At least felix has a naturel beauty not like kpop stars wearing make up ....

Jesus loves you

PEW NEWS!!!

when we thought 2020 was gonna be wholesome because of the start

Did anyone noticed? His body gets half missing whenever he crosses that colorless line 

Ik I&#39;m late, but congratulations, you deserved it!

PewDiePie wins most handsome faces in 2030Top -3

At least they didnt talk about his minecraft house getting burnt...

<a href="">13:12</a> pewds pulls his pillow up for it to immediately fall back down again but its 399

People are confused why a woman who looks like a chick is not on the list of handsome men?

Honestly I wouldn’t call most of the kpop  stars handsome like at all I would use pretty or beautiful when I think of the word handsome Felix def fits. I’m not saying the words to shame anyone or their looks but to me handsome is a more rugged type of look

go to <a href="">4:27</a> and look at December

You should be on the first

Pew: I am not a loserNew: you are a loserMe. : What

Disappointed when Felix is not in the 2020 list

Well I am a Kpop stan but HOW. DARE. U. TO. SAY. PEWDIEPIE. IS. UGLY.

<a href="">9:38</a> the word you&#39;re looking for is &quot;obnoxious&quot;

Lee Felix, as a 19-years-old fornite player, and probably a Pewdiepie fan, must be screaming after he noticed him.

PewDiePie would never quit YouTube, he&#39;s addicted to that PHAT cheddar ... He&#39;s been sucking the YouTube it too long.

I thought keanu reeves is number 1

Felix, You are beautiful handsome man!

i didnt think pewdie knew magic but managed to to make his microphone

He is so handsome and sweet. I don&#39;t understand why those immature kpoo stans are hating him? Well i am also kpop stam, i am an ARMY ,OK? But Felix deserved that Top2. BTW i am so happy for my boys as well... purple hearteu....

KPOP YASSSSSSS

He sounds like he&#39;s in loser denial

Happy half birthday video!

My school has &quot;HTV news&quot; and the music is the EXACT SAME, the schools news people are commiting to maximum plagiarism

Felix is an hansome guy and coolest guy

Your ritch thet you got from us

“I’m so glad I’m not poor” ~ pewds

those kpop stans are cringe....I&#39;m a kpop stan and I can say that not all of us are like that..we are not all shallow like that lol.  Ignore twitter because that&#39;s where the worse stans are haha

I just saw this in 1.25 speed by accident

This video made me feel so bad for Pewdiepie. I used to be someone who listened to the media, but now that I hear things from his true perspective, I stand behind him. 100%

Bro wtf I try to get on reddit and sign up to it while watching bottle flip championship to get to the 50 50

It’s a ghost

suprisingly i am live in malaysia and i agree.

Omg guys can you believe he came in second and markiplier wasn’t even in the list y’all see the problem

K pop GAY

Try auto captions...It says peru news

As of 2020, PewDiePie&#39;s net worth is estimated to be $40 million.

Sorry, on behalf of Malaysia.

&quot;Suck it Kpop stans&quot;-Poppy Smoria 2k20Words from heaven...

Hope to see New guy in YouTube Rewind 2020 but it&#39;s actually good by pewds 

The brofist was because in September, you earned <del>6.9 MIL</del>

do a story on SSR  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

18! 18 NI-

KPOP is ceiling gang, cringe.

As a Malaysian. I would like to say, who the fuck entered your hotel just to see you.(I knoe I&#39;m late)

I mean as a jungkook solo stan i&#39;m happy with the rankings at least taehyung wasnt second :D

Imagine being so popular that you search your name to get a picture of yourself

Yo, why the frick Poppy Smoria sayin &quot;I&quot; when she talks about pewds. SHE&#39;S NOT EVEN A DUDE!

Smoppy Poria

The thing is, the Kpop-stanning community in general has lots of toxic fans. Lots of people aren&#39;t really into Kpop and seeing those fans being so sensitive (some for understandable reasons, others are childish) over jokes makes them see Kpop as a whole in a bad light. We have a wide range of fans (different age groups, ethnicities, etc..)To anyone hating on eachother, Kpop stan or not, keep in mind that people have different tastes. Don&#39;t attack eachother cause it&#39;s pointless putting your opinion as a fact, which it isn&#39;t. To non-Kpop fans, not all of us act like salty kids so don&#39;t attack us whenever we breathe the name of a Kpop group. (lmfao take a shot everytime i said Kpop)Anyways, to non-Kpop fans, enough of that &quot;Kpop is gay&quot; &quot;Kpop is trash&quot; or &quot;They all wear a shit ton of makeup, they&#39;re just girls&quot; &amp; to Kpop fans, enough of that &quot;Ugh, why isn&#39;t HE/SHE on the list?&quot; &quot;Lmao he&#39;s so ugly compared to ____&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t think he&#39;s that attractive? Stop being a hater.&quot; (having different opinions isn&#39;t hating, Karen)-A BTS stan who&#39;s part of the 9 year old army 

Pepe loves u

I’m from 6 months in the future, and I think we could really use New Guy again.

hehe i a richer then himmmm :)))00)0))0 haha

Pewds came to Malaysia?Man, I missed a lot..

My boy

Everyone: talking abt kpop stans ME: not knowing what stans are...

I love you

hei

im literally just happy that felix met felix lol

<a href="">6:17</a> how about cocomelon later on

how about we make a news media and post every positive thing that pewds ever done.

He got buff so this year he&#39;ll be #1 on the list.

People hate New Guy cause he reminds Them...

PewDewPie bro you’re very handsome ok please don’t those shits ok what some people think bad about you

I was half asleep watching this and thought he was saying “nougat” instead of new guy

People need to stop justifying a wrong behavior based on logical fallacies. Whether the person is rich or not, stealing is wrong. Period. Idk why that&#39;s so hard to understand.

Yay, 105 Million

this is funny haha

Who else thought it was at 1 bill??Almost at 100 subs 

Click bait

Don’t all kpop people look the same

Wait popi sumorgia sad I googled my self but pewdiepie came out watttt

pewds I kept seeing you were such a controversial person/channel &amp; really didnt care to know who you were but I watched your vids later on and realized you were a high quality guy lol you&#39;re a legend

I think the one who voted him actually predicted future Having abs

I need Felix and Lee Felix to have an interaction just once.

90% of K-pop stars are ugly af

it’s just the basic thing that k-pop community does. Not all of them do, I have met a lot of sweet people in that community :). But it is also very, very toxic in some parts. So I know it is over now, but ignore them. They think they’re hurting us, but honestly I couldn’t care less what they say because I know pewds is the #1 hottest man alive .

I wish i can told Him HEHEHEEHEHE

HE SAID CONGRATS TO JUNGKOOK

Why do kpop stans hate on him? I&#39;m a kpop stan but like????

Peweipie: I’m not that attractiveAlso pewdipie: WHaT iAm ThE mOsT aTrAcTiVe PeRsOn In ThE WoRld

Pewdiepie should be 1st

I am shock you at the top 2 honestly

Pewds has every member of kpop beat on looks no questions asked

lot of them that dont like pewds for 2nd place have this kpop profile lol

anyone notice that felix guy is 69th place?

Actually pewdipie is definitely better looking than those k-pop stars

&quot;suck it k-pop stans&quot; now my fave words

I remember when Pewdiepie was a small channel and it&#39;s so weird to see so many people talking about him and seeing all this fake media really makes me upset. Felix deserves the world.

Shawn Mendes should have been number 1

Me: <b>Is a Kpop Stan</b>Also me: <b>watches pewds</b>Pewds: “Suck it Kpop stans*Me: <b>Is happy because pewds got it as well as jungkook</b>

Are your name is Felix

He is cool and funny guy who represents most of the normal guys. either they find him good looking or not you can&#39;t hate him.

yeet

Let&#39;s make him number one to make everyone mad

Making pewds most handsome no.2 .That&#39;s a warning to the world what the 104 mil. BroArmy can do

Lets make him most handsome face on the no. 1

Suck it K-Popers lmfao

Wtf albert einstein say people is going to be stupid not smarties in the future lol why people  did so much care about this shittt

In a response to the girl who made the art sort of referencing pewds. I actually sent her a nice message saying I liked her art style because pewds kind of inspired me to send a nice message instead of a rude and mean one. Maybe she’ll see that he’s not so bad and her fans are a good group of 19 year olds as well

pewds-WHATS THE BROFIST LOGO FOR!??!?me-<b>sees the 6.9 million dollars</b>  ._.

Come to Africa, none knows you here

When ur 19 year old army and bts army

whys everyone so salty that pewds is 2nd. we all know he is actually rlly good looking.

For 7 years I have watched pewdiepie, and every single moment of that time Ive thought pewdiepie is hot

Top 2 most beautiful and top 2 worst minecraft parent ever

I hate a lot of kpop stans even tho I am one. Fan culture is so toxic and many of them never admit that they are wrong 

Roses are red violets are blue PewDiePie is handsome why u jealous dude

I need to check if this is real

as a kpop fan and a person who has watched pewds for years, them kpop fans are a disgrace. and yes i take jokes of people roasting or teasing kpop as jokes as i do it too lol

Kpop fans comparing natural beauty to plastic surgeries.

I subscribed!

Pewdiepie is god.

&quot;haters hate themselves&quot;it all makes sense now..

don&#39;t the K-pop people use makeup?

I’m here just because i wanted to see his reaction to my boi Felix lolSkz vs pewdsStan stray kids plzWhere my stay friends at?

people suck pewds i handsomeee

How can we compare a normal looking guy (pewdiepie) and plastic surgery made half man - half woman?

The microphone in flying.

New news I have a new video

ohmayghad he mentioned jungkook HSHSHHSHSHSHSS

wtf he deserves to be 2nd 100%, well deserved in my opinion

Maybe Felix got voted #2 because not everyone is a K-Pop fan? Clearly, enough people thought he was handsome enough to vote on. Like, don&#39;t criticize people&#39;s personal taste like that? I personally don&#39;t think most K-Pop artists are hot or handsome, and would easily pick Felix over them, but that&#39;s just my opinion, like those other people have their opinions.

Keanuu should be namba 1

Pewdiepie I Challenge You

PewDiePie: I AM SO HAPPY I AM NUMBER 2!!!!!Haters: boo why is it PewDiePie??? Y&#39;all see the problem???Me: WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE PEW IS AMAZING

Btssssssssssss

I&#39;m a gamer and a kpop stan, those toxic fans? We dont claim them

STOP using THE lords NAME in VAIN!!! It’s EVERY episode BRO

Pewdiepie and bts were on the list I was hella satisfied

I voted for pewdiepie not in kpop

I stan BTS and I think Felix is hot AF bro. By admitting he is handsome does not make your favourite idol less beautiful.

Why is there a brofist?Headphones: Am I joke to you?

Not to be racist or anything, but Asian peopleCan’t even compare to the sexiness of PewDiePie

<a href="">6:36</a>Pewds: I&#39;m not quitting youtube!Me: Well yes, but actually no

i feel no empathy for someone who reaps what they&#39;ve sown

*Pewdiepie stans and kpop stans fighting * <b>me being both*: FeLiX kNoWs aBoUt LeE FeLiX *gasps</b>

IMO Felix is quite a more handsome guy than never heard of asian dyed hair edgy kpop singers who kinda look like girls.Just my opinion though.

Indonesia?🇲🇨

Guess what

Well im a kpop fan but happy about pewds getting number 2 hoping number 1 this year XD

What ? Bit confused now!

<a href="">0:40</a> Petition for Felix to meet Felix

felix lee host meme review 2020 can we make it happen 

Pewds won votes by :Pewds Face : 0.01%Pewds Viking Beard : 99.9%

<a href="">4:46</a> Did they actually make a funny number joke

331 million americans in the USA, someone like this whos worth billions, and believe me there are plenty people that have billion in the US could just give each american 1mill  every single human and i think thatll do more for us than a charity that probably gets funneled money out of from evil people anyway. Bloomberg spent 500 mil on campaign ads just to drop out of the race, he could have spent almost half that and paid the US citizen each 1 Mil and saved money. People who have more money than they could ever spend is just stupid to me and I cant believe not even one of these people is humble enough to try this?  Yea yea the value of the dollar would go down some maybe but who gives a fuck dude, each US American having 1 mil or 1 person having 50 bill that will jut sit there for there entir elife time hmmm wonder whats more helpful. Shits sad really.

i searched this video cause of Felix :vvv

PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then

Look I like bts and kpop but pewds deserves to be in the top 10 and that&#39;s a fact

Felix is probably screaming bc pewdiepie mentioned him lol

can someone tell me what the music in the backround is?

Can u donate 1m from india

I&#39;m the old guy

bts looks like a bunch of gay lesbians, that&#39;s right, they&#39;re gay and are also lesbian

I was shocked Pewds got no. 2...<b>HE SHOULD&#39;VE BEEN NUMBER 1</b>

Damn Poppy got a lotta twins.

I think StrayKids Felix and PewDiePew should meet sometime

BUT HONESTLY, OKAY, JAEHYUN IS HANDSOME BUT WTFFFF JUST BC YOUR IDOL AINT ON THE LIST DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE TO SHADE. BTW, PEWDS IS A FINE MAN FITE ME.

$500 mil

Enjoying watching the vid <b>ads in 3...</b>Me: NO!<b>ads in 2...1</b>

？？？its very interesting to see so many people are upset, cuz as an Asian I do think PDP look handsome and i don&#39;t even know some of the Asian guy on the list lol.

I thought it was one dollar.

Felix is handsome i kinda have a crush on him hahahahaha...

U

Poppy smoria: pewdiepie is the most beautiful person in world. Marzia: angry spaghetti noises

<a href="">2:00</a> i see the problem. PewDiePie shouldve got first.

Felex are you on the red team or the blue team? I am confused

What I learned today:<b>you can&#39;t argue with fact</b>

New Guy has ended the writers career.

руские поставте лайк типа чтото умное сказанул

Kto z polski daje 

I see the censored it’s 500 at thumbnail

T series is King of YouTube

Channels kinda slumping aye?

As an Asian from Singapore,I have to agree with Felix that plenty of the youths here are loud and annoying at times.Its one of the reasons why I never got into the culture

ngl, some of the kpop stars, esp the one who didnt make it on the list are hella ugly

More than 1% of the world is subed to you... congrats

The British was because he got 6.9 million

Also, what’s k-pop

Who’s the guy who got first?

Pewdiepie:MAN I love that guy                             Pewdiepie also: Is The GuyMe: HMMM ;-;

Indians: It Must Be $1

At furrycon some guy shout outed the guy who robbed pewdiepies house it was all along your old enemies

Donald trump should have got first place he&#39;s amazing

E du go eller haha

Great ^_^...

Pew: &quot;I&#39;m not quitting.&quot;CNN: &quot;pewdiepoe is quitting&quot;.

Living your life in a positive tone is what he wants for me and you... the world is already glutted with so much negativity, well do you want to add more to it?

pertanyaan nya adalah &quot;tampan setelah bertemu dokter bedah, atau sebelum bertemu dokter bedah&quot;sorry i got bad english so i write in indonesian language instead

<a href="">6:36</a> im not quitting yt? :(

someone who does two nice things but does a hundred racist things: &quot;b-b-but you d-didn&#39;t tell them about my gooD ThinG! !!&quot;

i want to see pewds reacont to more new guy memes ;-;

Ugly? I think not

100 Million

$ 20 Million

I respect your thoughts.

“It’s written in stone, it’s a fact.”And thats a rock fact

OMG you are so handsome guy:&#39;)

it&#39;s okay, felix. no hard feelings from Malaysia as well. my apology for the rude behaviour from Malaysia, if i ever see you, I&#39;ll say the secret phrase. im just sad you went to klcc first before me but i finally went there and recreate some of pics you had. love you 

Some people watch the late night news, but I watch pew news late at night

Spanish? :&#39;u

I love PewDiePie but I love Jungkook even more

I am Sven

these people are just salty lol, whenever my mom sees me watch felix shes like &quot;wow pewdiepie is very handsome&quot;

Uhhh Felix is beautiful sooo, I think first is justifiable.

Just bc you’re anti kpop or a hater of a specific group or you hate on a single member doesn’t mean you can insult other people’s idols. It makes no sense and a freaking waste of time and energy for doing that. It makes you seem rude, mean and annoying and it doesn’t make you someone who is emphatic and doesn’t think of other people’s feelings so stop doing that. Borahae 

I don’t get the point of those sexy lists because attractiveness is subjective. I’m 30. K-Pop stars look like 18 year olds. Grossssss (don’t come for me k-pop stans)

bi insan her videosunda 10 kere ı am so confused dermi q

Cool

Hi pow Diepie My whatsapp number 03425446622 Pakistan

Guys... I think poppy smoria kinda looks like pewdiepie... which must mean....poppy gloria must be her secret twin sister!

<a href="">6:37</a> - I&#39;m not quitting .. couple vids latter - I&#39;m quitting - nice

 it is very good brother. I like your video. I will study from you brother.thank you

I’m just sad for the fact he makes so much money and my mum never always makes a lot of money and still cares for me  

What do u actualy get in a year?

k-pop stars look like transgender women

Why does poppy smoria look like pewds? Guys? Im confused.

I think creeper should be #1. I&#39;d frick a creeper

JungKook and pewdiepie the most handsome

i want a child from you

lenda

<a href="">5:00</a> 

I mean this totally objectively but all the k pop stara look identical.  Very androginuus same eyes and weirdest of all and a major status symbol dad in South Korea and Japan is the skin bleaching.    I&#39;m crying cultural appropriation

Poppy smoria

Anyone else not seeing hiw videos in their recommended feed anymore. Forgot to watch any of his vids for a week or so.

<a href="">11:45</a> confirmed. Pewdiepie has no arms as well as legs, CGI. How deep does the rabbit hole go?

Felix is handsome y&#39;all kpop stans are just mean(Jk I actually love kpop but stop bein mean &gt;:0)

Wtf falo portugues

Porque tiene tantos suscriptores

Imagine how upset the media outlets will be when Pewds comes back from his break

Why do you always bother giving attention to the MsM? You know they&#39;re trash, your viewers know they&#39;re trash. I sense insecurity with your image.Stop apologizing and stop defending yourself, it&#39;s tacky!

I thought pew news was cancelled?

Media loves to sell pewds news

He didn’t even mention his fellow Swede Alexander Skarsgard

21

so how much money does he really have?

pewds is so handsome, i dont understand ppl’s problem with this :(

<a href="">4:29</a>-<a href="">4:50</a> nice

<a href="">6:37</a> :,(

We miss you

Good commentary on the comic.. to add to that I don&#39;t understand ufc where one guy can beat someone untill his unconscious.. it is not normal.

THe number one guy looked like a girl wtf lol

pewdiepie is Handsome. Its worlds handsome men not Korean handsome men. Not all are attractive to asian beauty you idiots

hes handsome .pewdipie is handsome he deserves it like not handsome should shaved hhahahahha

Awesome that Lilith Lovett got spotlighted here.  Always awesome on Dumping with Scrump

Кто русский лайк или я одна здесь такая ну что посмотрем сколько нас здесь

I mean seriously all korean look the goddamn same.

Pewds: I’d frick a creeperLiterally everyone else: I’d frick a pewds

LOL funny Popy Smoria PewNews I liked this video yes!!!! :)

有的互相帮助白细胞下降

I bet more than half the people complaining that pewds is ugly are boy kpop fans

Why plastic face k-poops even made it into the list? they&#39;re fake

Bc

Lmao when he saw Lee Felix and slammed his hands against the table I   w h e e z e d

New guy is actually Hodor

I found out his net worth 100 million on the back of his chair at the starting of the video

Poppy Smoria: refers to himself as pewdiepie<b>confused 19 year old noises</b>

I don’t know why SB737 isn’t on the list. I mean look at him.

Ok, why were the people who wear makeup most of the time on this list?

I&#39;m from Malaysia and yes we do get hype easily even if it&#39;s just little things. It can be chaotic sometimes and it&#39;s understandable why Felix might get offended by it. I personally accept his apology hopefully the other Malaysian fans also accept it.

Pewdiepie: father of joergen and SvenWater sheep: confused pikachu face

Most Kpop stars get plastic surgery. Like no hate to kpop stars or people who get plastic surgery, but most of the time that’s not how they originally looked like lol

<a href="">11:47</a> Well pewds, get ready for some heavy newsIt&#39;s apparently <b>normal</b> for kpop stans

It&#39;s because ppl don&#39;t know what handsome is. Pewdiepie is a god damn handsome fella. BTS stars are all pretty bc they look like girls with all the plastic surgery and feminine Asian features.

thanks for how you covered the &#39;new guy&#39; thing. this was my first time hearing of it and you did a nice job introducing me. thank you

In <a href="">2:00</a> , TAE DAY.. -TAE means POOP so in conclusion .. the name means &quot;POOP DAY&quot;..   *Now I gets why

<a href="">2:05</a> not sure if thats just hate, but felix doesnt have an ugly angle, at best average. The guy on the right looks like an albino toad and crossbreed with an anime character from psycho pass

U got the posture of a jacksepticeye with diarrea

He literally said he’s not quitting here then a few days later he posted his like, final brofist.

PEWDIEPIE YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND HANDSOME DONT EVER THINK YOUR UGLY

coome back to twitter !! but dont engangengen in the haters!! new guy2020

smh plastic got 1

100m

Full View Lols

100 million subscribers and most of these videos have 5 million views... I smell some bullshit in the air.

Cringe do hard

They all look the same so they better swallow their own peepeeEdit : no homo

Hey-dom, hey-hey! :3

lmao dont worry about the singapore one apparently our news outlets has no more headlines for their news lol

You are a legend. We have the same passion just I don&#39;t have the time before to pursue this passion coz I was busy working. Hope you could help me to have more subscribers too. 

T- seres

So I&#39;m confusion... is he quitting or not?

<a href="">0:40</a>Stan stray kids

<a href="">9:03</a> tbh I thought the comic was supposed to be ironic

K pop guy looks more of a lesbian then a guy

Poppy smoria should have a youtube channel

I wish new guy would be my friend.

Not gonna lie, I thought they repeated the same Asia guy but with a different alias, but turns out that they just look alike cause they Asian

Poppy smoria is the most confusing yet

pewdiepie just did the bad things due to socioeconomic difficulties check your privilige

Pewdiepie is second on the listMomo not even on the list

Jungkookie 

<a href="">2:06</a> Wait…but your Poppy smoria…

That&#39;s why he is at number 2 but I never thought he would at that place

Actually K-Pop idols are not really beautiful without make up no hate I love K-Pop so Felix is actually also handsome without makeup

“Ew he’s so ugly, omg he’s so hot” <b>pfp is a picture of anyone but themselves</b>

New guy is best guy

Pewdz: “I’m not a loser I swear I dont google myself.”<b>clicks on cnn article</b>CNN: “Media portrayed PewDiePie as a loser to sell his success story, says Pewdz.”

Felix is very handsome, people need to stop and get over themselves, besides this list is nothing to get snippy over, and your kpop idol is probably ugly get over it lmao.

I am tired of people like the artist of new guy who hate just for being rich when in reality they would not be giving away their money if they were successful

The sun is so credible that they give pewdiepie 21 million more subscribers

They’re just jealous 

What is the name of that flying mic?

Itz crazy how the kpop stans were waiting for all their kpops idols to make the list,. they all look the same.

Felix is handsome asf. K-pop stans are blind, that’s why they think their idols are handsome 

But Pewds is legitemately handsome I dont understand those people...

PEWDIEPIE IS MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER IN THE WORLD IF PEWDIEPIE IS YOUR BEST YOUTUBER IN THE WORD CLICK HERE️

kpop fans are as toxic as rust players they spam the shit outa kpop content then hate anyone that dislikes them or what they do or who doesn&#39;t agree

I&#39;m a lesbian and i can admit Felix is handsome, I think it&#39;s his personality too idk but do people really think he&#39;s ugly?

Well pew dont use makeup and plastic surgery as kpop artist

Türkiyee

I offended that pewdiepie is #2,he should’ve been #1

Poppy pew news

Calvoooo

pls do a collab with mr lee felix he games to but a noob. teach him your ways master.

Before long, morality will be called a &quot;privilege.&quot;

suckitkpopstans lmfao poppy smoria!

I’m just happy my not Harold was in the top 15

I don’t know why, I just find “New Guy” annoying. I like Pewdiepie and all, I just for some reason don’t like him

“Yeongook oNe”

I don’t get how Jungkook made first place sorry but like.. there are more handsome guys out there :)) - written by a kpop stan

i hate how so many people are going after pewdiepie...its such bullshit at this point its a waste of time and energy, and pewds probably just wants to live a good life without having to worry about this stuff

What the hell is a kpop stan?

Seems a lot of K-pop fans don&#39;t know what the word &quot;handsome&quot; means.

Pewdiepie is so hot I would be gay for him even tho I’m straight

Pwediepie scandal lmao

Plz come to india people will love uLove from india

The people that said Pewds was ugly don&#39;t portrait the entirety of kpop fans. People should just calm down. Like, how tf do they expect all of their favs to be in the list? It includes men from all around the world and the kpop idols are all handsome. Expecting one of your favs to make the list is very optimistic

FELIX FROM SKZ LMAO

<a href="">00:46</a> shit, I thought that was tobuscus...

<a href="">13:01</a> why did I read it from left, top to bottom then right, top to bottom‍️‍️‍️

Kpop fans are really mad XD

<a href="">2:51</a> if anybody is confused pewds swapped places

“Pewdiepie shows art without without crediting artist”

charityfridaywithfelix?

Who loves poppy smoria  ¦  ¦  ¦  ¦

React to Stray kids

Those people who say he isn’t good looking clearly haven’t seen him in beard

Isn&#39;t this strange poppy smoria saying &quot;I&quot; when talking about pewdiepie what a weirdoEdit: I just saw this comment down in the comments and I didn&#39;t steal that I was watching the video and commented what I noticed I&#39;m not tryna steal

PewDiepie: he is coughing.                   Media: he is realeasing million of germs in the air before quitting youtube

im waiting for the moment pewds realizes that when he read about the name felix on wikihow, it was written about lee felix aka the kpop idol in this video LMAOOO

I was created to be the joke, but through you turned me into for 2020! Butt of an insensitive love, support and kindness some thing amazing.

Malaysia sad noises

Sub

I mean Pewds is actually pretty fucking handsome tbh

I asked Alexa on my fire stick and it said 30mil

Wait a second.. Poppy Smoria said &quot;im not quitting Youtube!!&quot; Hmmmm. I thought pewdiepie was the one mistaken for quitting youtube.. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm i think im on to something. Poppy is pewdiepie confirmed

Lets create a meme for the people say pewds is not handsome

When an Asian Russia bot trolls everyone by posting a woke discrimination suggestion and the #1 pic was a Korean Kpop star.

<a href="">2:12</a> I&#39;m a Kpop stan and I don&#39;t even know who the f*ck is the guy on the right! Some K-pop stans can be really really loud and imature... and then they don&#39;t like it when they are called 12y/old...

I mean who cares if jaehyun didn&#39;t make it in the list, felix is handsome lmao beauty is just subjective

<a href="">2:42</a> HOLY CRAP! THEY GOT PEWDIEPIE TO GUEST STAR ON PEW NEWS?!

QUEM É BRDA LIKE

My guess is 500,000,000

Lol my two favorite Felix are in the list this is amazing. Stan Stray Kids

Stan Felix the father to Joergen and SvenAlso stan Felix the lost child

Okay . So I don’t know who this is . But I hear about him often . And I see he has millions of subscribers . Who is he and what is he about ??? He seems cool but I don’t know what he does . Don’t hate me lol

Kpop fans are toxic and cringy af, pewdiepie should be number 1, grow the f up

Pewdiepie made it 2nd becuase we didnt accept k pop so we can keep making that chinese k pop guy to make more hondas

Felix is very very handsome ‍️‍️

felix is quite handsome I don&#39;t see why they&#39;re so angry. He may not be the MOST handsome but he is good looking

Bru

I’m confused.... wasn’t Taehyung the second one.....? I might be wrong but...I’m confused....HELP

K-Pop singers don&#39;t seem like men to me, rather like pretty females. Felix is a true handsome male lmao

I dnt mind if Felix calls us hectic n screamish to us Malaysians cuz its a fact. And this is coming from a Malaysian. So yea.. u dnt hv to forgive, yet i feel honored that he mentioned Malaysia in his channel. To me, its a big thumbs up.. 

Felix is really handsome. Don’t be mad because your fave didn’t make it on the list. Why even care?

Felix and Felix :). They both make me smile.

Meme PewDiePie face is nice Fans your face is ugly

Poppy Smorias mic is floatingg 

Pewdiepie: posts videos about WW3 memesWW3: <b>*starts*</b>Media: Pewdiepie starts WW3!

<b>I think Pewds are beautifuler when BTS guy</b>

Pewds just talks News: omg pewdiepie is evil!

I&#39;m Singaporean and I promise we don&#39;t act like that and I&#39;m sorry if that&#39;s how you feel about us. I hope you have a nice day!

I apologize on behalf of kpop stans. I honestly don’t like the way big groups fans act. All Stan’s should be ashamed. Pewds IS handsome. And should’ve have gotten #1 ️ sincerely- kpop stan

K-pop is literally the worst music to ever exist

your a sexy beast you should be at number 1

I did the q and a ????????????

HAT!! OMG PEWDS IS HOT

What is wrong with people he has to APOLOGIZE because people were stalking him wtf

No NEW GUY NOOOOOO

This is a genuine question, but is Poopdle good? Should I play it?

<a href="">0:51</a> PEWDIEPIE?!

Wow. The new youtube system is soooooooooooooo shit it&#39;s got pewdiepie talking politically

Pewdiepie: <b>literally just breathes</b>Media: Famous youtuber Pewdiepie against anti-global warming movements as he wastes the valuable resource O2

I think that poppy smoria is pewdiepie  ( no hate it is just a theory )

Pewdiepie: Suck it Kpop stans!Me: Try’s to like the video for a second time.

New Guy looks like a character from Fanboy and Chum Chum

PewDiePie: * breath *Media: he&#39;s mocking the dead!!!!!!

FATHER OF JOERGEN AND SVEN!!!!!!

pewdiepie: <b>breaths</b>the sun: PEWDIEPIE BLOWS SMELLY BREATH ON ALL FANS BEFORE QUITING YOUTUBE

<a href="">13:02</a> I was created to be the joke. But through You turned me into for ZoZo! butt of a insensitive love, support and kindness something Amazing

Felix being mad at kpop stans:Me remembering how broken he was when bts unfollowed him on twitter: 

Felix finally meeting lee felix:Me: <b>happy noises</b>(Like if you think felix from stray kids should host meme review, if not then just ignore this and don’t talk shit about kpop cuz i ain’t got no time for childish ass people)

Pewdiepie is moderately attractive, at least in my opinion. And that&#39;s comming from a Lesbian.

some korean almosttrapguy: not on the listkpop fans: <b>small pp REEEEEEing</b>

Artist: creates someone to be hated on The internet: HE IS THE GOOD GUY !

I think the 100 most handsome faces is based on their followers on all platforms you peaked last year because you hit 100 million subs. Just a theory tho, although I know this is &quot;kinda&quot; there explanation for it. Not sure tho

I don&#39;t find k-pop attractive at all and I don&#39;t understand how one got first place. But hey, that&#39;s just how I feel no disrespect to k-pop fans

I love how poppy gloria pretends to be the person the article is about (pewdiepie) and says what they think pewdiepie is feeling

Just for the record, Felix is absolutely not ugly. He&#39;s a good looking dude.

Is that Floppy Harloppy?

You really don&#39;t need to explain every obvious little thing you said, damn it. You deserve a break, man, to remember what you as a person are worth. AND GET BEBE - nah just kidding.

we need minecraft back

wait, you haven’t quit youtube yet?

you were not 18 the last time, you were 18 NI-

<a href="">0:40</a> felix²

Wasn’t Walt Disney a massive antisemite?

<a href="">10:38</a> also i know it &quot;doesnt matter&quot; but this &quot;girl&quot; is a trans &quot;woman&quot; so, with that context... im just saying.

If you speak spanish LONROT is 1000 times better this guy is spam compared.

&quot;Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.&quot; - Master Yoda

We all need a new guy in our lives

I&#39;m from Malaysia and I was so happy that you came to Malaysia, even though I found out after the vid that you posted XD. I&#39;m sorry your first time experience in Malaysia was that way. Just know that we were hella excited and hope that you&#39;d come back to Malaysia again, this time visit the other states :D.

New Guy = God

Wonder who has the most money bill gates, jay z, or PewDiePie

Damn Poppy Smoria still got that sick floating mic

Felix is a very handsome man!

Felix watch the MXR video! They are having a problem with a COPYSTRIKE company and this problem with yt should get more voices. I hope the next PewNews will somehow include this topic.

For me who don&#39;t care about shit music or listening and watching trendy shit because it&#39;s trendy because I have a mind of my own. What even is k-pop?

Felix deserved the #1 spot tbh

Golly.

What&#39;s with the kpop fetish? I dont understand why people fantasize over them or why they are a thing

excuse me

We all ️ new guy

pewdiepie: existsmedia: pewdiepie steals air from needy children before quitting youtubeif someone already made this joke im sorry dont atatck me pls

I totally can&#39;t tell how much he is worth from the thumbnail ok

I’m not the most good looking guy but the k pop stars aren’t handsome They’re cute

anybody else get a gta v movie ad thats 70 minutes long?

<a href="">2:14</a> the dude on the right didn&#39;t make the list because he looks like the catfish with the human face

It&#39;s hard to be a kpop stan and a 19 year old in this society

I am confused, if Poppy is doing a review on Pewdiepie, then why is he saying &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;?  Please explain!

Me: <b>Type out an offensive comment to boomers</b>Also me: <b>Deletes it so it isn&#39;t held against pewds in the media</b>

Pewds, you should def play The Last of Us PART 2 when you come back from the break... please.

Feliks: tried hard to laugh even though he dies inside when everyone calls him ugly

all these kpop stans are angry that their faves didnt make the list but maybe if yall voted for them ‍️plus theres no such thing as the most handsome face everyone has their own opinion there will always be at least 1 person who finds that person ugly

honestly i dont think kpop stars should be on the list at all because they all look the fucking same

I just want that you stop to explain things that we (who really watches the videos) UNDERSTAND the meaning and context at the very first time we watched, yknw

I VOTED FOR PEWDIEPIE FOR THE HANDSOME FACESS!!!

Felix: <b>says &quot;epic&quot; at </b><b><a href="">3:39</a></b><a href="">3:40</a>  : <b>ad named Epic plays</b>

Well i just strated watching your channel now, but even though you have more than 100 million subs, your videos have about 4 to 5 million views...Dude perfect has less subs and more vies and active subs

<a href="">1:59</a> &quot;Y&#39;ALL SEE THE PROBLEM?!?!&quot;-No, we don&#39;t.

Thicc boi

Thicc boi

make bebe with new guy 

Cool headphones️

They Write extra stupid news about felix so they get into the Video and get fame

I&#39;m surprised, there isn&#39;t as much Stays as I thought there would be in the comment section

I think k pop stars and the like, ( men with extremely feminine or child like faces), look like they have some sort genetic or hormonal defect. Like down syndrome

Half way this video became lwiay instead of pewnews

I miss Gloria borger

 Wonderful Job Felix! You should’ve got number  but Jungkook is beautiful and deserves it too!

I like how PewDiePie Mike floats

Is poppy smoria related to pew die pie?

Peediepie

Pentagon HexagonOctagon Iran is gon

Sorry from Malaysia,we just that CRAZY,like good crazy

1. you&#39;re an artist who doesnt make enough money and has to work a day job.2. You make a distastefull comic joke.3. Your artist career is in ruin for making fun of someone wealthier than you.Sorry guys I don&#39;t think this is right. I mean critize obviously but leave it at that pls.

Moneey

Moneeey

How the hell do these people think it&#39;s funny to get robbed? Like I see so many comments on other platforms saying that.  They are so heartless.  Just because you have money doesn&#39;t mean you suddenly aren&#39;t human anymore.  Robbery is horrifying and compromises your sense of security and safety, it&#39;s not just losing money &quot;that you can buy back&quot; (which btw, if you have one of a kinds pieces, you can&#39;t). Losing valuables is honestly the least scary thing when getting your home robbed.

Pewds is hella hot. Id smash. Place 1 for me

Brag much. Geeez we get it, you donate to charity.

Meme: hallmarksFelix: LaNdMaRkS

I&#39;m a big fan of both pewdiepie and kpop and i just don&#39;t see why people are mad there are many other things to be mad about in this world OK.

Im the good guy, duh.

Good ebening

“Cos I’m a millionaire, apparently”“SO TAKE IT FROM THE SECOND SWEDISH MINECRAFT MULTIMILLIONAIRE”

Kpop is gay anyway.

I&#39;m confused, why aren&#39;t all the kpop stars #1 if junkook is #1, they all look the same.

There&#39;s this one article that state that you apologized to the Malaysian ppl for calling them hectic and scream-ish ppl. I, a Malaysian hurted a little when you said that but since u apologized its ++cool. A lot of Malaysian ppl are like that (hectic and scream-ish) it&#39;s also very annoying, they&#39;re just so excited to see you (like other famous ppl) to the point they&#39;re very annoying to deal with, sowwy. I&#39;m like that sometimes so I don&#39;t have the rights to teach people manners. My point is, that&#39;s how we are, we are a bit unaware on what we&#39;re doing, we&#39;re not like most Japanese ppl; polite, nice, respective towards ppl etc. Sorry for treating you like a very important person until we can&#39;t see you as a normal dude like everyone, thank you for visiting Malaysia, please visit us again if you want.-A subcriber from 2014? idk.

Hello, I need HELP ,out of desperation I have to ask for help . I live in Belarus, take care of a sick grandmother, work as a teacher at a school for $ 250, I ask you for one cent, it will help me a lot, thank you very MUCH, all good ! VISA card number 4286 2259 9082 8956 03/23

But felix is honestly so handsome! and really famous so off course hes gonna make it stop

In Italy più news

I’m excused from being in the WWIII because I’m busy training my alien friend to grow extra “tushies”. So far she/he/they have managed to make tulips, not two-cheeks. ( also I do acknowledge that this is the wrong video for my WWIII excusing )

What did pewds dooo? He made a natzi joke right? I thought that was normal online at this point.

This is golden and deserves more views

|[&lt;

the worse part is articles literally have to search pewdiepie up on youtube to find correct information

There not wrong . Your not bad looking.

Pewdiepie:exists Media: confirms death

Hope he doesn&#39;t get too stressed with all the media bs

those kpop stars should be in the top 100 prettiest women category.

I think you&#39;re a decent guy, pewds.

Not quitting i thought poppy already quitted, hmmmmmmmmmm? Also About that break, you should take it Pewds you need one.

Why are people actually confused? He is a handsome guy.

Jerks PewDiePie desveres to be on that list he is the best

The author of the OG New Guy comic made New Guy such a genuine, likable character and herself so unlikable that I genuinely wonder if she&#39;s a genius and this was her intention all along.

lol

Kpop stans are sucks

Those k pop dudes look like chicks you frickin tools

Me as Malaysian is ashamed... but that&#39;s how some of us whenever seeing &quot;celebrity&quot;. Some of us have no fan-to-celebrity ethic.

<a href="">9:40</a> the word you&#39;re looking for has got to either be &quot;ego-centric&quot; or &quot;smal pepe&quot;

I&#39;m the president of South Sweden and would like to expel Pewdiepie from our country.

Pewdiepie: TalksMedia: pewdiepie insulting the people who cant talk?!?

PewDiePie&#39;s Subscribers...The Force commands you to Subscribe to me for the FORCE is not mistaken!Please do as you are asked...(I love PewDiePie and the community btw i am not a hack)

pewdiepie is a lazy gamer

Guys immediately after robbing Felix:&quot;IT WAS JUST A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT BRO, CHILL&quot;

Well I think u should be number 1

K-pop fanbase is so gay like for the love of god have some self respect

<b>Jungkook is pronounced Jungkook</b>Pewds: yUngkOokMe: goOd joB

That bass in the intro tho

Keanu reeves didn&#39;t even make the list....

Pewdiepie: look a lot of k-pop stars Me: FELIX FROM STRAY KIDS I LOVE YoU!!!!!!!!

Bonsoir

Pewds, you&#39;re a great person.After all these years of being a streamer and all the money you&#39;ve made, you&#39;re still a good person with a big heart which is extremely rare.Don&#39;t ever apologize for being honest about how you feel about something...It&#39;s bs that you can&#39;t be honest or have opinions without getting called out by some sort of group of people for doing something &quot;bad&quot;, but that happens when you have millions of people watching you everyday.I know you&#39;re Swedish but you can&#39;t keep everyone happy, no matter how hard you try.So just be you mate and you&#39;ll be awesome.

pewdepie is #1 because the kpop guy is wearing makeup

2020 just started and New Guy is already a candidate for meme of the decade.

Pewdiepie: &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about this person who made this webcomic.&quot;Me: Well they CLEARLY don&#39;t know you either and it shows, so don&#39;t worry bout it. lol

new guy is like a new pepe, love it.

Pewdiepie needs to stopo paying attention to Media, i know im not suppose to give my opinion but!.

Bruh K pop is trash, their opinion doesn’t matter

When poppy smoria said he will be taking a break for a few months

Purple haired chick with cat eye glasses is a bad person? Well imagine my shock!

People celebrated you being robbed?

Leaked: Poppy Smoria is Pewdiepie&#39;s sister!

wholesomeness

NewGuy is my new best friend

did you taken a shower before video

People who had surgeries on their face are disqualified.

We really should give the robber some props, without him we would never have New guy.THANKS ROBBER

but Malaysians ARE hectic and scream-ish, have you heard us???

i thought i heard beastmaster64

This guy should be squeezed and thrown in the rubbish bin

i am a millionaire

Pewds is literally a dozen times more truthful than actual media, and he&#39;s actually entertaining as well

Uuuuuu kpoppies can be so cringy,  they always just care about looks. If their fave wins some voted beauty award they use that as actual achievement, and if they lose they bash others for it. Apologies for that kpop stan, since their profile shows they&#39;re a a bts &#39;fan&#39; I feel the need to do that. You&#39;re handsome Felix. I don&#39;t care about kpop stans since they&#39;re usually always hatefull..

Guys pewdiepies mic is floating

Boria Glorger

New Guy is based and red-pilled

I give thumbs up  because you said suck it, and That! is comedy lol.

-&quot;Also, WWIII is happening&quot;

<a href="">2:52</a>

<a href="">2:54</a>

<a href="">2:53</a>

<a href="">2:57</a>

I know Pewds had to hurdle extreme obstacles but goddamn, I’d love to laugh at the mistakes I’ve made that the media keeps gaslighting. The media sucks. I barely watch it. I keep up with news on NPR and BBC and the local news for my town. You are human. Anderson Cooper has said more stupid/offensive things than you and not one of those comments he’s made are remotely racist.

They’re just upset you didn’t reach nummer one.

kpop stans: &quot;making fun of peoples appearance is bigoted and causes depression&quot;also kpop stans: &quot;HES UGLYY BECAUSE MY STAN DIDNT MAKE THE LIIIISSTTT&quot;

WHAT? PEWDIEPIE Donated and raised lots of money to charity??? WHO CARES HE SAID THE N WORD GRRR AND HE MEMED ABOUT THE NASSIS GRRRR WHO CARE IF HE GAVE TONS OF MONEY TO PEOPLE IN NEED??? THIS MAN SAID THE N WORD OMFG! actually wtf is wrong with people in this fucking world. Its called freedom of speech. Get over yourself and stop caring about what other people does or says aslong as the person does not hurt anyone, he can do whatever he wants. Specially if the person helps people in need.

That artist is so dumb

<a href="">1:37</a> the mic looks like it is floating

This guy just can&#39;t stop apologizing for doing nothing wrong because people are offended over nothing. What a puss.

New year, new guy

Give us a house tour my guy

omg i never saw his marzia tattoo , cuuuuuute !!!! its a heart with an M in

pewds have marzia, losers dont get marzia, im loser :(

When is Pewds going to wake up and realize that they know you are not quitting YouTube but they think if they spread that lie often enough it will damage your brand. They aren&#39;t stupid, journalists know the power they possess. You are now a path to the &quot;right&quot; and so must be destroyed.

The green screen has problems

Some people don&#39;t realize that the majority of people who are burgled have house insurance so they are covered it&#39;s not about money but irreplaceable possessions and the comfort you feel in your own home.

lucky me i dont stay at KL

Marzia: hey can you enter me in one of your games honey Pewdiepie:sure sweetheart Pewdiepie:*enters her in a game about poop*

<a href="">6:51</a> Nope I&#39;m from Malaysia but I stan Pewds :&gt;

The star omg PewDiePie is quitting youtube forever/PewDiePie I not quitting YouTube

I love that guy to

Either way the real question is can I lend a tenner 

Kpop stans... they are brutal... without mercy... but you, you will be worse.RIP AND TEAR! UNTIL IT IS DONE!

poppy smoria is a kpop stan?!?!?

look, if the majority of the list is already kpop singers why are people complaining, it&#39;s cringe, it&#39;s a YouTube video, not the Oscars (also they&#39;re not that handsome imo, i saw a picture of the kid from ice age 1 next to one, and i&#39;;ll never un-see it lol)

Few days late but I love New Guy. :)

Why new guy low key look like captain  underpants?

Шо я туть делаю??

It&#39;s perfectly fine to be happy when something bad happens to people you dislike. Saying otherwise is like saying that having any negative emotions is not normal. However, claiming that these feeling are good IS fucked up. It means that the person in question lost connection with humanity to the point where they can&#39;t even objectively look at their behavior before making it public.

Pewdiepie vs korean stars are like natural looks vs artificial godlike looks smh

50 years later:Media: remember his anti-semitism scandal?

My name chandler (:

as a Malaysian fan, I think I speak for most of us when I say we’re not at all offended that you were uncomfortable by our fanatic behaviour, and I want to apologise for my country’s behalf as we should be the ones apologising, not you for constantly bombarding you when you were here, and you should be able to express that to us freely without being judged:’))

Hej

This looks like a nightmare to me. Anything you say,the media tries to spin into something that paints you in a bad light

WooHoo Poppy Smoria!

Number 1 of that list.You could drag your finger across there and dig trenches deep enough to have an entire war in.

Find maem make sentimental Me I just what maem

I&#39;m not gonna say that I hate K Pop stans, but I certainly don&#39;t like them

I&#39;m sorry that you felt that way in Singapore. There&#39;s no reason to apologize. In fact I feel that many of my countrymen are entitled dick heads. Don&#39;t let the garbage get in your way.

PEWDS!! as a malaysian,u absolutely did not have to apologise for ur experience in Malaysia (and Singapore). People here can be quite &quot;crazy&quot; when it comes to well-known people visiting our country. Its probably because we rarely get visited by celebrities,but it doesnt make our behaviour right. Its stalking and disrupting ur vacation. It made u feel unsafe. People in asia really need to know that celebrities are humans who wanna have private lives too if anything,we shud apologise to you. I wasnt personally there,but I on behalf of malaysians apologised for raiding ur vacation here. We wanted u to have a great experience,but what u got was a mess. I do hope u come visit again in the future.

This vid was uploaded on my birthday

New Guy is my spirit animal! Mean people suck.

<b>me still angry because danny devito’s never on the list </b>

Why is number 1 not Dr.phil ;(

i&#39;m malaysian and tbh those wild fans are scary and disturbing 

PewNews is the best news!

Bro.. BTS popstars arena even attractive LMAO (my option)

Don’t worry about it. Take care. Love from Malaysia 🇲🇾

You know, about the Malaysian and Singaporean fans thing. He&#39;s actually right, most of the fans are not chill at all and screamish. I am a Malaysian fan myself and I see that. I am a bros myself since way back in 2013.

<b>*kjellberg*</b>

First time seeing the beautiful faces list and I love jungkook

Those K-pop weebs shouldn&#39;t be nominated for anything.

Im a kpop fan but i love you alsooooooo

All those asian dudes look like women. Just me?

new guy kinda looks like Patrick

Pewdiepie got beaten in the most handsome faces by some guy named jungle book damn

Literally. There are 3 levels of loser. I know bc my whole group is all a bunch of losers. I&#39;m first class loser so I&#39;m the coolest. But my friend poopis is middle class loser.

Poppy Smoria was saying pronouns that sounded like she was saying she was PewDiePie, weird???

My mouth tastes like pine

I think being top 10 has become a meme but he does deserve it

Felix is really handsome ngl. Everyone’s just mad cause their k-pop Stan ain’t on the list.

Shouldn&#39;t news sources ask to put you in a article???

felix we love felix too

the problem with kpop stans is that they complain about white people like felix being voted one of the most beautiful men or whatever and they try to make it a thing like there’s no diversity when -jungkook was literally number one-there were multiple asian men on the listanyways kpop stans fetishize korean men/asian men in general and it’s toxic

Where&#39;s gloria Borger go?

I think the guy making the handsome faces list is kinda overworked... he put the same guy in like 15 times

did anyone else notice that september was 6.9 million?

here for the memes 

behold , for long time you&#39;ve been farted in the darkness

Poppy : they use me as the ugly examplePewds :no , it’s me they’re making fun of me because they can’t be #2 like me 

+K-pop stars are 90% make up

It’s funny seeing all the butthurt Kpop fans

did anybody else notice the little tattoo on his arm thats a heart with an &quot;M&quot; in it. thats so cute

In case you forgot

<a href="">2:00</a> in that pic pewds is hot af, the guy on the left might be good at singing, but he&#39;s that hot in the pic

Let’s just say pewdepie is the king of memes

ricardo will nr 1 next year

gloria borger really is using the pronoun &quot; I &quot; a lot :|

Is Poppy Smoria a Schizophrenic that believes herself to be Pewdiepie?

New guy should be meme of the decade 2020 to 2030

I like how the microphone just flying around

&quot;pewdiepie says he lied about annoying malasian fans before quiting youtube to move to korea&quot;

The k pop stars are just clones of each other

handsome? all those kpop faces are girls.

Jungkook is so perfect  But I miss Kim Taehyung

:) :) :)

Pewdiepie:makes pew newsEveryone in comments: pewdiepie <b>does nothing</b> media: <b>exaggerates</b>

dude, i love that you rip into the stupidity of the media in trying to sell their shite, ur hilariouse. keep it up, bro fist!

To be fair..the kpop guys picked look the same so

Felix Chellberg: drinks and spills a littleMedia: Pewdy mocks fires in Australia

Pewdiepie.  : Kills a mosquito.           Media.  :He is a muderer

Kpop Stan respect people thanks

You don’t have to apologize to us 19 year olds. We understand your humor and sarcasm and way of explaining things

This video should be called “POPPY SMORIA SPITS STRAIGHT FACTS FOR 15 MINUTES

Me when my first attempt fails <a href="">2:50</a>

So basically: non-asian = ugly?

Don&#39;t really feel bad the author of that comic is getting shit. She has a habit of telling people to fuck off whenever they criticize her and uses her being trans as an excuse to literally shit upon other lgbt people who feel she&#39;s doing more harm than good. Hell she made a whole comic series about how trans men are literally the worst thing to ever exist. Screw her.

Facyou

I have nothing against ARMYs but just look.

Pew news is my go to news. Screw all the other news pew news is the bomb

PewDiePie if you want to have more subs than T-series then you should do a live stream until you passes T-series

I feel like you shouldn’t try to round a final opinion on a person based on so few comic strip/writing/photo/media etc. but by the second comic strip, I was over purple top.

I love his accent

Im a kpop stan.But damn Ricardo shouldve been first place

PewDiePie: I&#39;m not quitting youtube Media: Youtuber Pewdiepie who is a racist bastard says &quot; I&#39;m never quitting Youtube &quot;.

Why u even apologize for being uncomfortable. I as an SEA citizen is embarrassed by our own behavior. As someone times it kinda be too wild

fu*k kpop

Poppy Smoria: PEWDIEPIE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PERSON IN THE PLANET!!!ME: I guess Jung-kook&#39;s an alien or something...

Media is like a plunger, always bringing up old shit

Please use your platform to make a peace movement Felix we need you to save the world!! no pressure

Subs 2 pewdie pie

HAPPY NEW YEAR LETS GET 1 BILLION SUBS THIS YEAR

I Love These memes in the comments about the media and pewdie lol

Look at my name and profile picture 

Instead the meme template should have featured him and the chair.

i just really like the microphone

pewds fans gotta chill on judging asian beauty standards gosh- by korean standards, yes the korean artists are handsome, they may not be YOUR definition of handsome, but they are in fact handsome. and Felix is in fact Australian, with Korean genes. cant yall just be happy for pewds for getting 2nd on tccandler instead of disrespecting all the other artists who worked just as hard as pewds did (like in general)?stop putting your own definition of being &quot;handsome&quot; or &quot;masculine&quot; onto different cultures that you know nothing ofto keep it clear, when i say pewds its pewdiepie and felix as felix from stray kids (tccandler made a mistake and translated Stray Kids to be Lost Child)

Networth?I have no time to watch whole video examination is going on

I make about $300 a month. I&#39;m sure Pewds makes more lol

Felix isn&#39;t ugly though , he&#39;s even prettier than jungkook ,some kpopers are just so salty lol

Pewdiepie farts.Media: Pewdiepie farts propan gas that will go up in the atmosphere and help cause global warming before quitting youtube.

There was an article named “Obnoxiously Hard Platformer Jump King Defeats YouTube King PewDiePie.” The way that title is structured makes it sound like Felix is the king of all games and is finally defeated. The writers also can’t take a joke.

His net worth is 20 million dollars as of 2020

<a href="">1:50</a>, he was shocked because you weren&#39;t first on the list

My fave Felix look was the dark beard and light hair 

Felix is very handsome! Def more handsome than all those Kpop ladies

U asian man 

As a (half)Malaysian, I have to admit that the behaviour you described is indeed learned though I&#39;m not exactly sure from where it came from.. I remember growing up and having friends ask me if I want to go to so-and-so hotel because they found out that their favourite band is staying there.. Its nice to hear a &quot;celebrity&quot; say how uncomfortable that behaviour makes them feel, because I always thought it was a weird thing to do in the first place!

bigtimePewds: How you doin&#39; youtube its bigtimePewds, here is my thought of the day: Haters really hate themselfs , live your life and frick all the haters thats the 9 year old way, take it eass!

I love you. . OMG!

Sapela suka tgk mamat ni. Meluat.

I&#39;m so glad pewnews is recurring again. I liked that about this channel.edit: I skipped the entire minecraft phase. Not my type of content.

Anyone get the vibe that poppy smoria looks like pewdiepie

Kpop girls, I mean boys

So how much is he worth?

Pewdiepie: thanks for voting for meLiterally every 9 yr old: YOUR WELCOME!!

Jeez, pewdiepie is so lazy. Getting poppy smoria to come in and apologise pretending to be him.

<a href="">1:50</a> he was shocked because you should have been n.1

honestly felix looks better than the #1 guy too

JEON JUNGKOOK YASS

i love you

But his childhood photo looked like a guy who would frick every single girl just with his small pp

Just noticed the normal thumbnails are back.. F best thumbnails

Hey, again im sorry about Malaysia. I know how my people can be like

Pewdiepie:this is the first time i google myselfAlso pewdiepie 5 years ago:I GooGLE MySelF

Pewdeipie chutiya hai like karo

I&#39;m angry on the internet!

24 billion views

<a href="">4:48</a> There was a Brofist because you made 6.9Can I get a NICE?

Jokes asidePewds is handsome

pity pie

Are Pewdiepie videos always conceited and shallow like this?Glad I never subscribed.

Кто понимает  русский, ЛАЙКЧИТАТЬ ДАЛЬШЕ

I think Felix got number two because what&#39;s making him handsome is not just his face/aspect but, his charisma reaching a larger audience . I&#39;m just speaking for myself but, his vid cheered me up during a dark period of my life and I&#39;m sure kpop is able to do that too. His friendlyness is what add that touch of beautiful in the inside. After all, i think our view of a handsome guy is not based on the perfection of in his face but, also for their charisma which doesn&#39;t depend on face but actions and personality. Why else some actors made it in the top 10 without having an androgynous face? That kpop artist might have a beautiful face and a supportive fanbase but, his charisma wasn&#39;t long-ranged to reach people outside of his fanbase. But we cant really know the criteria on which this result in the list are based on...

Pewds is more handsome than all those k-pop stars, and more attractive, do they even count as handsome? I feel like pretty is more suitable, there many more handsome people out there though, take Bradt Pitt and Ryan Reynolds.

2020 we&#39;re going for first place

Thought you were taking a break?I mean I love your channel but you need rest man

I DON’T GET THE COMIC THING

Guys sorry for spoiler but it’s 12

<a href="">2:47</a> you weren&#39;t supposed to give your opinion,poppy

Poor pewds

How the Frick do they even earn something for those BS articles it annoyes me so much.... - _-

Felix meets Lee Felix(Raise ur hand if ur a stray kids stan :D)

the sun = bad

Why do they rank k-pop stars differently if they have the same face

For get the rest pewdiepie is the best

Du e ju fan top 3PEWDIEPIE

All pewdiepie does is play games and laugh at memes is he really a bad guy for just being here for a long time he’s so nice let’s be real he’s given to charity, he’s had a healthy relationship with his girlfriend for a long time and married her... he’s literally just a normal dude that just shows people what he makes

Pewdiepie, although a 9-year-old at heart, can to the objective female eye be considered as attractive.

At least PewDiePie didn&#39;t win the 2nd place by doing Plastic Surgery

This episode of pew news was really cool bc it had part of pewdiepie’s name in it, such a cool and lucky coincidence.

And o am happy he got 2nd place

PewDiePie is amazing and beautiful

Lee Felix!!!

You were in Malaysia????? And you were HUNTED?????? Dangit Malaysia...

Despite all the memes Felix legitimately deserved to be number one because he is a good looking dude

Yung kook lmao

Gov gov gov

Call me racist but none of the kpop stars deserve anything even close to top 100 all they have is arrogant fan bases who gass them up. They all look the same with coloured hairstyles

Lee felix

You are right Pewds, celebrating others misfortune isn&#39;t normal, unless you&#39;re a socialist.. then rich people deserve bad things happening to them, you know, cause they have money.

Yes Felix

Feelin&#39; this....Gary Vee, PewdiePie, &amp; New Guy are my vibe

You&#39;re hot and you know it. Marzia is one lucky gal to wake up to that face every morning.But I have a husband and he&#39;s also very handsome, in my opinion :D

His sign off is adorable

F&#39;s in the chat for &quot;New Guy&quot;

So wait. When are you quitting Youtube?

PewDiePie: <b>being mature about it</b>Everyone besides the salty people: &quot;Yep!&quot;Salty people: <b>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!</b>ME: 

The media have to stop treating life lessons as eternal mistakes. Pewds may have said some ignorant things but he is not ACTIVELY ignorant. He said sorry and he tries to be better. Everyone who writes for the Sun be acting like they dropped out of the womb fully woke. Bitch please.

Unpopular Opinion: KPop stars are overrated.

i dont know what is sadder ... the fact that pewdiepie hates the country im born and raised in or the fact that i am born and raised in that country :/ . also on behalf  of malaysia i apologise if they&#39;ve made u uncomfortable during your visit :&#39;(

Let’s get pewdiepie to number 1 this year

MEDIA:PEWDIEPIE beated his microphone to a broken piece of stick

LMAO why are you apologising? Singaporeans aren&#39;t the most gracious, we know it ourselves.

Some random Kpop fan:*Calls Pewds Ugly*Gamers:The council will decide your faith19 year olds:We would like to know your locationMe:*Pulls out a glock*

We did it

Did anyone notice also that the artist drew New Guy to look like a skin head, implying that the type of people who support pewdiepie are bad.But in reality the internet didn&#39;t judge New Guy by his looks, but by his actions like good people should.

Like if pew should go bald

Pewdiepie: “Yeon kook one”Me: “Jeon Jung-kook. It’s okay”

All jokes aside Felix is actually pretty attractive

Pewds: this is stoneMe: ur Mum is stone <b>laughs and bro fists friend</b>

She has purple cool-aid in her hair what do you expect?

You see? If the artist wasn&#39;t such an asshole and understand Pewds is a nice angel. She would not become a meme in seconds. lol

Production value 100.

Pewds when he stops playing minecraft and Sven is left behind, maya and Edgar:    :)

Pewds is GORG SCREW EVERYBODY

K pop idols look like girls

Pewds is actually attractive y’all just mad you don’t have the fab to be #2

Felix from Stray Kids is mentioned for a second time in one of his video, therefore Felix now must stan them.

He is a person who has experienced life as a father of sven and know modeling...

Art gives way so people can express themself and she express herself truthfully here

I like how he called him yungkuk

dicks out for new guy

when you realize Felix doesn’t use the same face for every thumbnail now:what the frick

Pew dudes

Hey Felix, Let me borrow 2 mil subscribers, you&#39;ll still keep 100!

New Guy is so wholesome. Be more like New Guy.

I’m a Kpop Stan and I also love Pewds so I’m really upset that kpop stans are coming at Pewds and im disappointed. Just because ur favorite Idol didn’t make it doesn’t mean you have to tear him/others down. I think he’s very handsome and y’all need to calm down

The &quot;New Guy&quot; comic reminded me of this other comic artist from a while back who is also a total douche lol. She makes comics about fetishizing transgender people, and then gets offended when people call her out for it. She also made a comic portraying herself as a sexual predator who makes other women uncomfortable by catcalling them. It&#39;s funny how bad people can never view themselves as bad people.

Next week: &quot;Popular Youtuber PewDiePie set to earn $1.3 Billion in 2020&quot;

Media: PewDiePie once again proofs to be racist by enslaving villagers and forcing them to &quot;Frick&quot; and make &quot;bébé&quot; to enslave, if they prove useless he feeds them to mobs terrorising them further or just executes them with lava.

I’ll reveal one of the darkest secret of all timeYour mom lied to you you’re ugly

If doing charity doesn&#39;t make ou a good person why should doing one bad thing make you a demon

I’m a K-Pop Stan and I think it’s ridiculous that  some K-Pop stans are just angry that some of  their favourite K-Pop idols didn’t make it on the list like it is not the most handsome in K-Pop but in the world

Kajshdhsj his reaction to lee felix, honestly I was waiting for it :&#39;u

wait pewds went to malaysia and i didnt know

PewDiePie: <b>Breaths</b> Media: <b>DID HE JUST SAY THE N-WORD AGAIN!?!?!?</b>

hahaha POPPY SMORIA, always you with the brilliant names

Bsdke baag

Jesus felix 4 ads in one video ur rolling in dat cash money

Best news source ever

Pewdiepie vinyl figure ships when?

You should let Simon from neebs gaming punch you in the face

people be like look at that kpop star useing filters so damn well looking good.. meanwhile pewds just got a normal freaking picture of his to 2nd placeartist is like one of the biggest tsundere, and i doubt that she actually disikes pewds xD its just a fun semi dark humor satire, i like it i wouldve like to know the  artist, and read through the stuff

school shootings r underrated

Typical women in malaysia when they see k-pop star.... Screaming like they having histeria ┐(´д｀)┌And yes im from malaysia 🇲🇾...peace yo 

Pewds is a kpop star

Imagine getting beaten by a guy named Jungle Book

I just wanna know where he bought that floating mic arm

the people in kpop kinda look like girls with short hair

“He has all the <b>landmarks</b> of a good protagonist”<a href="">10:20</a>

I hate kpop stans so much

Pewdiepie: <b>brushes hair</b>Media: he&#39;s making fun of people with cancer

I think you are handsome too
