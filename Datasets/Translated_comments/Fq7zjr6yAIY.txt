And then I no longer watch fast &amp; furious because it saddens me too much, it was and will forever be the legend of cinema and what really saddens me is that it wasn't him who was driving the guy who was driving knew the road and was a pro at driving driving really I continue thinking that he does it on purpose He will remain forever in our hearts even if I never knew her it's as if I had known her in any case you are forever in our hearts force a the family and their filming friends 😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Without him fast &amp; furious it's nothing it's not just what happened to him because it's not him who was driving especially I feel sorry for the colleagues who we do fast &amp; furious with him so this message is for them

My idol and favorite actor since I knew Fast and Furious, Gone too soon in the eyes of all of us. You are no longer here, God has taken you, But as you made us understand, &quot; ;If one day speed kills me, don't cry because I was smiling&quot;So rest in peace, Because your death is for you the noblest that there is...

I don’t care if that car blew up I would die so he could have lived❤️😭

It's too bad that Paul Waker died, may he rest in peace 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

Happy from Brian's bar from Fast and Furious I wanted to say it's very sad that Brian died from Fast and Furious I'm very sad my name in this place Andrade Santos I live in Canarana and I feel I'm crying to this day I'm a big fan of Brazil watching all the Fast and Furious films of him crying to this day to this day I don't need to believe it but if someone did something bad to my Brasileirão glasses cold if someone did bad to him they will pay for it with God Brian is still there He's still doing The Fast and the Furious, I hope God

Why is he dead? He doesn't deserve this

Wau not rip paul waker is talk news
I missyou

On

Yesterday evening on 20, they rebroadcast F&amp;F TD and F&amp;F6 and after a report on Paul... Truly a Gentleman, a Good Person beyond the handsome guy. He doesn't is only 3 years older than me, yet I cried like a child at this sad news at the time... and still today, watching the F&amp;F I think that the US has lost the new Steve McQueen of the 21st century... My first cinematographic memory with him is Skull Secret Society, it was already him who burst the screen much more than Josh - main protagonist of the film -.. In short, it's a huge loss on a human and entertainment level. My favorite FF is the 5 in my country of origin and I wish that the FF which for me embody the Paul's Movies become cult - at least until FF7. Rest in peace Paul, we will never forget you. best regard
Rest in peace

My God, I live in Brazil but it hasn't sunk in for me yet, we fall in love with these heroes through a TV screen that we never see or touch, this boy will stay in my mind until I die, so I'm a driver car driver I'm passionate about speed and cars, when he had the accident my city stopped there were comments everywhere and laments, Rede Record TV showed it almost every week so we didn't miss a single fast and furious, that Jesus Christ Son of May God receive him in his deserved glory, my condolences to all the family and friends of this great actor... Brazilians of Brazil, we are together.

Great artist, it was a shame
I miss you qaun wacker
Even though the years go by I still cry a lot when I see his last movie, thank you for who you were Paul, I love you very much and I always remember you, for the great man you were and left a great mark, because I still don't believe it was an accident, If not, it was ill-intentioned, good things are short-lived and that was what happened with you, I hope you are resting in the afterlife, thank you for helping the people of Chile for the F27 earthquake of 2010, I think you won the heaven for them, may God keep you and give you eternal rest Paul.

It’s a pity for Paul Walker, how ironic Paul starred in a movie about cars and died in a car accident. What are you paying, I don’t understand, everyone will die, just accept it and know that all your mothers, fathers, grandparents, etc. will die.
RIP my idol. Every time I go to film you I have tears in my eyes
Thanks
I don't believe you, men, it wasn't the one who left. He left.
Even after 6 years he will always be remembered he was truly a legend of Fast &amp; Furious ✊🏽
