I have tried to pen down why having Rajeev Masand on Chalchitra Talks is so special for me. Have written something about it on my blog. :) <a href="">

Here&#39;s what I recommend movies based on loneliness and isolation:-1. Her(2013)2. Inside Llewyn Davis3. Amelie4. Lost in Translation5. In the Mood for Love

Rajeev maha sand
Taxi Driver (1976) just watch this film.... Such a classic ‚ù§Ô∏è.... One of the best movies on loneliness

None of them are available on Netflix or amazon prime.

Rajeev: I would have added &quot;Her&quot; to that list. and Killa is so similar to &quot;Eighth Grade&quot; , let me know?

taxi driver?into the wild?

I think Taxi Driver ....the best movie ever made about loneliness .

Killa‚ù§Ô∏è
The way he talks about Killa ... now I&#39;ve got to see it!

The perks of being a wallflower flower ....

&#39;Manchester by the Sea&#39; is such a powerful film, it should have been on the list.

Vaibhav, a sincere request. I love how the content is evolving and how the channel has grown. But for movie recommendations, can you please go back to the backdrop you had in the first few episodes? I know you have moved but that shouldn&#39;t be hard to recreate. It&#39;s just something about it that adds to the tone of the show.

All are depressing movies.

Nice video<a href="">#chalchitrababa</a>
Rajeev is great<a href="">#chalchitrababa</a>

Ye chutia buddha so called film critics or reviewer..ko q bualte ho bhai

Lunch Box honi chahiye thi

Shining by jack nicholson was another movie you missed

Ryan gossling and casey afflick are the best fit for these kind of movies

Thinking why I watched it.

What a pitty this guy. And you

You recommend such awesome movies but give 4 out of 5 stars to shitty Bollywood movies like Dabang. You even give a star or two for &#39;starcast&#39; as if its Diwali and you are distributing sweets. I leterally went home after watching Dabang for 15 mins in a theatre.

He is chutiya and even his recommendation is chutiyapa...If you want to see go and watch.1.Lemon Tree2. Separation 3. Two Legged Horse 4. Swanshank Redemption 5. 12 years Slave

On your list should be HER

Only film to watch about loneliness is Taxi Driverüò¨

When he said loneliness/isolation I expected A death in the Gunj to be there somewhere. One of my all time favourites. Or 36 Chowringhee Lane. Directorial debuts- daughter, mother. But perhaps they would be more familiar to cinephiles in India than some of these titles.

I totally agree with the recommendations made. Some more you may want to watch are on here: <a href="">

Omg i love somewhere and Lars!!!

Funnily, I watched the only Indian film recommended here. Killa is awesome, Avinash Arun&#39;s cinematography is amazing in the film and he should direct more films and not just shoot them.

U havent wrote ‚Äúudaan‚Äù on the description

Calm down man

Killa is great. Hope more people watch good recent marathi films

shitty recs tbh.
I have seen Killa and its beautiful. There is one more Marathi film by the name &quot;Vihir&quot; on loneliness directed by Umesh Kulkarni. This movie is also mind-boggling and touches your inner self a bit too much.

He really loves killa. Noice!!

I was right! revolutionary road. cool recommendations Rajeev,will watch some of them right away...

Hi Vaibhav, can you please recommend some movies on journalism? I&#39;m waiting......

Good recommendation, u also watch into the wild that movie influence me.‚úåÔ∏è

I think  u should check INTO THE WILD. Rajeev

5 Recommendation by Rajeev Masand on the theme : Loneliness / Isolation :1)Somewhere (2010)2)Lars And The Real Girl (2007)3)Revolutionary Road (2008)4)Away We Go (2009)5)Killa (2015)

How can you miss movie HER. Such an amazing movie it was on loneliness.

Watching Rajeev talk about chalchitra talks in the end I was almost expecting him to say I give chalchitra talks 4 out 5 stars.

Vaibhab, can you recommend some Bengali movies?However love your show. Good luck.

Please tell me which 5 films he told..

Ah! This is so good.

thanks Rajeev masand for this film recommendation. have you got afraid after seeing JOKER

&#39;&#39;Salt and Pepper fatty dude&#39;&#39;-Sandeep Reddy Vanga,2019.

Hey Vaibhav. I&#39;ve been trying to find some movies/shows based on or around hikikomori. I&#39;ve seen castaway on the moon but couldn&#39;t find anything else. I hope you&#39;ll help cuz that&#39;s what you do :) Thanks.

This was more like 4 hollywood films by 4 hollywood directors before they directed thier studio breakthrough films. Please don&#39;t recommend films which people  already know of/heard of. Try researching more and improving your taste for better. I love most of stuff you put out but try gaining a wider knowledge of films, try not to stick to hollywood.

Revolutionary Road available on Netflix

You look like Fernando Alonso...
Its me from nepal. I m indie film maker you are among those critics for whom i never respected. But now there is a huge redpect for. You rajev. For the support of this channel

Ahaha the man himself. Nice picks i haven&#39;t seen yet.

This theme reminds me of films like Safe(1995) by Todd Haynes &amp; Harold &amp; Maude(1971) by Hal Ashby. Both about lonliness but one with a positive take &amp; the other a negative one

Revolutionary road is an impeccably crafted underrated film.. it‚Äôs a tough watch considering how intense it is but my go to film anytime I wanna feel true emotions. Both Leo and Kate did a fabulous job at that!! Lovely

Great recommendations by Rajiv sir. He also mentioned Udaan which is one of my favorite films. I still remember when I first saw Udaan in the big screen and came out of the theater crying.

I have watched 4 out of 5 films. All because of Rajeev&#39;s reviews when they came out. Lars and the real girl was recommended by him on Now showing as well. :)
