I love this song
Whenever I listen to this song it touches my soulÔ∏èÔ∏è

I devote this song to someone who completely changed my life. It was one-sided, but it was true and that is why it hurts so much . Deep inside, I would really miss her but I  just hope wherever she is, may she be always happy       - From a One-sided selfless well-wisher

The song is a melody of love and fulfillment in itself...

Who all wants?Ghajini2 aana chaye...
I still remember that 1 lakh 35 thousand from Kalpana.

What a scene...Only few lucky people gets such pure hearted angels...

Benny Dayal is such an underated singer

The moment he realised he will never be as rich as Kalpana 

On this day 4 years ago my bf hugged me for the first time in Benny Dayal concert when he was singing this song 

she never gonna know who is sanjay  

Kalpana naam aaj aaj nahi hu nahi hu ye movie yaad aati hai ye hota hai emotion really missing those days I read this CD at home or har weak yeh laga hii lete  I used to sing that day
 my favorite flim 
Pure nostalgia 
Nice feeling

No words for kalpana character... It&#39;s really really heart touching

Now the question arises that why is conservation of resources necessary? Natural resources are very important for all living beings on the earth in general and for the human community in particular because the existence and life of all living beings depend on them. This is our common heritage which we have to share with future generations. .

I feel the same for My Love  Aafreen 

Ho ho ho.. how I got you on fate, I don't believe that you came down in the lake, like the moon descends slowly sometimes, slowly like the lukewarm sunshine in the ocean, you touched me and passed by, do I see you like this or I listen to you, you are the peace You are the passion, why didn't you come earlier? How did I get you? Do you believe in fate? I used to think that God has no time these days, yet by creating you, he rose in status in my eyes. It grew further, come come come.. The paths changed, the waterfalls and the rivers changed, the team of lamps started the team of life, some new tune changed, the drizzle of the rain changed, the seasons changed, but I will always remain the same, with my arms in your arms, every moment, every moment, come come. .. Life has become a star, the drizzle has become Malhar, I don't know how to believe in my destiny, how did I find you.

<a href="">2:55</a>The whole brain is moving in a different direction
From 1995 to 2002 - 5 awards - Rangeela, Dil Se, Taal, Lagaan, Saathiya. From 2006 to 2011- 5 Awards - RDB, Guru, Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, Delhi-6, Rockstar. Not to forget Roja, Bombay, Jodha Akbar, Swades, Ghajini, Yuvraaj, Tamasha, Highway, Ranjhana that didn&#39;t win awards. He is a Gift from God to music. All albums are the Pure Gold Treasury of Bollywood and I am not even starting on what he&#39;s done in Tamil. That will take a book to complete not a comment on youtube. Shreya Di&#39;s voice in Rahman songs is just pure divinity! Just listen to Munbe Vaa. Even I don&#39;t understand the lyrics but I listen to it twice everyday. What a song it is!I laugh when people compare Pritam to Rahman. Its not an insult to Rahman but an insult to music.

My only urge was that -  Kalpana before dying should know the real Identity of Amir i.e Sanjay Singhania.

Democracies are based on political equality. All individuals have equal weight in electing representatives. Parallel to the process of bringing individuals into the political arena on an equal footing,we find growing economic inequalities. A small number of ultra - rich enjoy a highly disproportionate share of wealth and incomes.

Human rights are those rights that every person in the world has without any discrimination because of being a human being. These are the same in all countries. If any human rights are violated then the Human Rights Commission can investigate it. National Human Rights Commission was formed in the year 1993. It is an independent commission. Like the judiciary, the Commission is also independent from the government. The Commission is appointed by the President and generally only retired judges, officers, or prominent citizens are appointed to it, but it does not have the responsibility of giving decisions in court cases. The more you lake, the more.....?

Due to earthquake occurring on the surface of the sea, a destructive surge in sea waves is generated which is called tsunami. That is, tsunami is generated due to earthquake occurring on the ocean floor. The upsurge in ocean currents due to the attraction of the Sun and the Moon is called tide. Tsunami does not have a fixed period of occurrence and is a random phenomenon whereas high and low tides occur twice every month on new moon and full moon.

All five permanent members have to agree with the course of action. The Security Council can recommend the use of a blockade or other financial impositions for any nation that is deemed as breaking international law. If these do not work, then the Security Council can call on the United Nations to use military force to enforce its will. This is the major difference from the League of Nations - the United Nations has the ability to enforce its decisions as each member state has to pledge to provide military component depending on its national wealth and capability.

All of us have enormous capabilities.   In many of us however,our achievements fail to correlate with our potential, because of lack of self discipline - the effort needed to channel our energy to productive uses.

<a href="">03:48</a>

I saw this movie for the first time about 12 years ago when I was 9 years old. This movie has a deep place in my heart. Even though I have watched it more than 10 times so far, I don&#39;t get bored.  Because everything is perfect in this movie. Screenplay, actors, soundtrack, everything.  Every time I watch it, I feel like I&#39;m watching it for the first time and I watch it with excitement.

My love for this masterpiece never gonna die

what a deep lyrics has this song 

But much of our confidence about our own well - being comes from the assumption that our lives are easier than those of earlier generations.

In 2000s, AR Rahman was on . From 2007 to 2009, he dropped some absolute gems like Guru, Jodha-Akbar, Ghajini, Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, Yuvvraaj (amazing songs &amp; awesome BGM), Slumdog, Blue, Delhi-6, and more. These albums were pure gold and will stick in our memories for a long, long time.Seriously, no other composers even come close to what he pulled off in just these 3 years. Every album he touched was incredibly fresh, unique, and downright magical. ARR Ô∏èÔ∏è

This song was released when we read together, loving each other unconditionally. But this song really made me happy. This is our first or last movie we have watched together. I would like to become a housewife, God wanted to say this, I have forgotten this love. Where is &quot;Ghajhini Dharmatma&quot; No one has died on my head or all the old memories have been forgotten. Do not marry because of different caste. God has given happiness for a few moments and also the joy of life. I hope she will be happy. Wherever you are, you are happy, do you ever remember me in your dreams. Our love was true. As soon as I remember, I listened to this song. I have cried every now and then. Today this song is with me in the game. His memory is with me and does not go away.

The fella who was the villian is probably one of the most hated villians lol.Beautiful movie and this song is just beautiful. Cried my heart out watching this when I was 13 and I&#39;m 26 today and still crying. Thank you for this movie, a brilliant movie.

Heart touching movie and song 

PS

Reality bolu is the best movie till date
Truely a bliss to ears listening this melodious song even after 13 years it still feels the same emotion love

The movement Sachin realised that kalpana is far richer than him

Literally im crying...Today 30/9/23 maine yeh movie dekhi...just a masterpiece 

Shreya Ghosal is the best singer ever, what a voice

I still hold on to my memories 

I've taken the most beautiful eyes of my uncle. I've taken the most beautiful eyes of my uncle. I've taken the most beautiful eyes of my uncle I've been to my uncle and I've been to my grandfather
What a genius composition,hats off to writer, musician,singers and actors.extraordinary

Love is pure feeling and this generation who only thinks about (cheatings and replacements ) won&#39;t understand this feeling Love is unconditional no one can really replace that place which you had for your loved ones like sanjay and kalpana..(incomplete story with genuine and pure love )

What day was that day?

when ghajini was released i was just 5 ,i still have very found memories of it .the scene in which kalpana was murdered was so traumatize for a child i still remeber every bit of movie  and when kalpana gives money to sanjay i was too small to understand that cult scene but when i randomdly find this song again after ages it gives me goosebumps &gt;3
