Now the question arises that why is conservation of resources necessary? Natural resources are very important for all living beings on the earth in general and for the human community in particular because the existence and life of all living beings depend on them. This is our common heritage which we have to share with future generations. .🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I feel the same for My Love  ❤Aafreen ❤

Ho ho ho.. how I got you on fate, I don't believe that you came down in the lake, like the moon descends slowly sometimes, slowly like the lukewarm sunshine in the ocean, you touched me and passed by, do I see you like this or I listen to you, you are the peace You are the passion, why didn't you come earlier? How did I get you? Do you believe in fate? I used to think that God has no time these days, yet by creating you, he rose in status in my eyes. It grew further, come come come.. The paths changed, the waterfalls and the rivers changed, the team of lamps started the team of life, some new tune changed, the drizzle of the rain changed, the seasons changed, but I will always remain the same, with my arms in your arms, every moment, every moment, come come. .. Life has become a star, the drizzle has become Malhar, I don't know how to believe in my destiny, how did I find you.
This song is one of my most favorite song 🎵 ♥️♥️♥️I love this song always and forever ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Love you shriya

Hello ji
This movie had some of greatest songs (Behka, Guzarish, Kaise Mujhe,..)

I am very lucky beacause this gajni movie realese in 2008❤️💝

Who is the sun in this year 2024????
<a href="">2:55</a>The whole brain is moving in a different direction😢
From 1995 to 2002 - 5 awards - Rangeela, Dil Se, Taal, Lagaan, Saathiya. From 2006 to 2011- 5 Awards - RDB, Guru, Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, Delhi-6, Rockstar. Not to forget Roja, Bombay, Jodha Akbar, Swades, Ghajini, Yuvraaj, Tamasha, Highway, Ranjhana that didn&#39;t win awards. He is a Gift from God to music. All albums are the Pure Gold Treasury of Bollywood and I am not even starting on what he&#39;s done in Tamil. That will take a book to complete not a comment on youtube. Shreya Di&#39;s voice in Rahman songs is just pure divinity! Just listen to Munbe Vaa. Even I don&#39;t understand the lyrics but I listen to it twice everyday. What a song it is!I laugh when people compare Pritam to Rahman. Its not an insult to Rahman but an insult to music.

Master piece ♥️
My fav song 🥺
love you song
<a href="">2:56</a>

Masterpiece listening in 2024

<a href="">3:32</a> Paths have changed, waterfalls and rivers have changed, the team of lamps has played a new tune in life, the drizzle of rain has changed, seasons have changed, but I will always remain the same with you in my arms, every moment. Every moment these lines ❤️

after being in a toxic relationship of over 10 years, I broke up in 2022 and I can&#39;t believe I have found someone who loves me madly and more than that respects me. We were lying today and I played this song for him. Today, 9th Jan 2024. I hope we can cherish this song for the rest of our lives.

Shreya Ghosal Part ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Badlengi Rituyen Asa...Par ma rahunga sada Teri ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Really heart touching song ❤❤❤❤

the moment he realised she is way richer than he ever can be .

My only urge was that -  Kalpana before dying should know the real Identity of Amir i.e Sanjay Singhania.

Natural resources are simply the resources that human beings use for their protection, shelter, comfort, etc. The earth is abundant in natural resources,but they should be used judiciously. Natural resources are naturally occurring resources in the environment that have not been disturbed by the humans. 👍👍👍👍👍

Plants have a duty towards children. How well children are taken care of in a particular society can be determined by how sensitive the adults are towards their rights. How prosperous the society is. What should be done for them in times of distress?👍👍👍👍👍
Shreya is best ❤❤

I am here after watching Modi jee singing this song for Meloni.

Music always plays a vital role in making a moment memorable, the better the music the better the scene and a memory that lasts longer. That too is a phenomenal song, slow &amp; finds the soul.

Melt my heart anytime🥺❤️
Hii honey ❤

I dedicate this song to my Viru Babu who taught me what is love, his love is everything for me. May God bless him always ❤️

Democracies are based on political equality. All individuals have equal weight in electing representatives. Parallel to the process of bringing individuals into the political arena on an equal footing,we find growing economic inequalities. A small number of ultra - rich enjoy a highly disproportionate share of wealth and incomes. 👍👍👍👍👍

My ever favorite song❤❤❤❤. Full of emotions feelings

2023. !!!😢

Human rights are those rights that every person in the world has without any discrimination because of being a human being. These are the same in all countries. If any human rights are violated then the Human Rights Commission can investigate it. National Human Rights Commission was formed in the year 1993. It is an independent commission. Like the judiciary, the Commission is also independent from the government. The Commission is appointed by the President and generally only retired judges, officers, or prominent citizens are appointed to it, but it does not have the responsibility of giving decisions in court cases. The more you lake, the more.....?👍👍👍👍👍
Its an old song but it&#39;s create a new place in my heart❤ while I&#39;m listening 🎧.

Due to earthquake occurring on the surface of the sea, a destructive surge in sea waves is generated which is called tsunami. That is, tsunami is generated due to earthquake occurring on the ocean floor. The upsurge in ocean currents due to the attraction of the Sun and the Moon is called tide. Tsunami does not have a fixed period of occurrence and is a random phenomenon whereas high and low tides occur twice every month on new moon and full moon.👍👍👍👍👍

Red Fort is situated on the banks of Yamuna river. On one side of it are the green banks of Yamuna, famous mausoleums like Rajghat, Vijayghat, Shantivan, Shakti Sthal etc. On the other side, just in front of the main gate, there is the huge market of Chandni Chowk. Jama Masjid is in front of its south gate. Mughal emperors used to go to this mosque daily to offer namaz. Even after 300 years, its strength remains intact. Above the strong wall made of red stones, a series of crown-shaped designed stones. Is made.👍👍👍👍👍
Therefore, there is a need to develop a sustainable path of energy development. Advances in energy conservation and increased use of renewable energy resources are the basis of sustainable energy. At present, Asia is counted among the minority energy efficient countries in the world. Therefore, we have to adopt a careful approach to judicious use of limited resources of energy. It is necessary to pay attention to the following points for energy conservation?👍👍👍👍👍

Although irrigation facilities have expanded in the country after independence, two-thirds of the cultivated area is still dependent on rain. The water being used for various purposes is not of utility standard. Waste water from homes, industrial centers and cities is the main source of water pollution. It is being predicted that by 2025, 30 crore people will suffer from severe water shortage.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

When a body vibrates,it does not oscillate as a whole but a part of it oscillates to - and - fro about its mean position. Motion which suddenly changes from one type to another is called random motion. 👍👍👍👍👍

If this song still remains in your playlist that means you definitely have a great taste in music

All five permanent members have to agree with the course of action. The Security Council can recommend the use of a blockade or other financial impositions for any nation that is deemed as breaking international law. If these do not work, then the Security Council can call on the United Nations to use military force to enforce its will. This is the major difference from the League of Nations - the United Nations has the ability to enforce its decisions as each member state has to pledge to provide military component depending on its national wealth and capability. 👍👍👍👍👍

All of us have enormous capabilities.   In many of us however,our achievements fail to correlate with our potential, because of lack of self discipline - the effort needed to channel our energy to productive uses. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

I was 5 year old when i watched this movie till now this movie and its songs are my favorite ❤️❤️

<a href="">03:48</a>

I saw this movie for the first time about 12 years ago when I was 9 years old. This movie has a deep place in my heart. Even though I have watched it more than 10 times so far, I don&#39;t get bored.  Because everything is perfect in this movie. Screenplay, actors, soundtrack, everything.  Every time I watch it, I feel like I&#39;m watching it for the first time and I watch it with excitement.🥹

My love for this masterpiece never gonna die

what a deep lyrics has this song ❤

But much of our confidence about our own well - being comes from the assumption that our lives are easier than those of earlier generations. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

In 2000s, AR Rahman was on 🔥🔥🔥🔥. From 2007 to 2009, he dropped some absolute gems like Guru, Jodha-Akbar, Ghajini, Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, Yuvvraaj (amazing songs &amp; awesome BGM), Slumdog, Blue, Delhi-6, and more. These albums were pure gold and will stick in our memories for a long, long time.Seriously, no other composers even come close to what he pulled off in just these 3 years. Every album he touched was incredibly fresh, unique, and downright magical. ARR ❤️❤️

Hi

Believe me Narendra Modi brings me here ...

The media dresses the story up in a way that will sell fear, and doing so will perpetuate racism and racial hatred, which, as with all hatred, is bred by fear. We are educated through the media that the respective colours of the skin is more important than the crime itself. 👍👍👍👍👍

Incomplete love is painful but also extremely beautiful 🖤✨

Aamir khan best acting and look

superb song so sad 😢😢
How did I find you? 🥺🥺🥺🥺
This song was released when we read together, loving each other unconditionally. But this song really made me happy. This is our first or last movie we have watched together. I would like to become a housewife, God wanted to say this, I have forgotten this love. Where is &quot;Ghajhini Dharmatma&quot; No one has died on my head or all the old memories have been forgotten. 😢Do not marry because of different caste. God has given happiness for a few moments and also the joy of life. I hope she will be happy. Wherever you are, you are happy, do you ever remember me in your dreams. Our love was true. As soon as I remember, I listened to this song. I have cried every now and then. Today this song is with me in the game. His memory is with me and does not go away.
When tamils enter into bollywood some miracle happens

Shreya Ghosal is the best singer ever, what a voice

I still hold on to my memories 😢💔

I've taken the most beautiful eyes of my uncle. I've taken the most beautiful eyes of my uncle. I've taken the most beautiful eyes of my uncle I've been to my uncle and I've been to my grandfather
What a genius composition,hats off to writer, musician,singers and actors.extraordinary

Love is pure feeling and this generation who only thinks about (cheatings and replacements ) won&#39;t understand this feeling Love is unconditional no one can really replace that place which you had for your loved ones like sanjay and kalpana❤..(incomplete story with genuine and pure love )

What day was that day?
