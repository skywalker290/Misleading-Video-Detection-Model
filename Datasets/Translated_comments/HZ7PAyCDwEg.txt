isme to roman reigns bhi h

Who are here after Bade Miyaan Chote Miyaa Trailer released

2024 anyone???📍They&#39;ve released this movie in the Wrong Time!They should have released this movie in 2023/24!

TBH It Is better Than F9 And FX 😁

Part from <a href="">2:39</a> is setup so well. Especially the part at <a href="">02:51</a> where they be like &#39;&#39;OOWAAAAAA!!!&#39;&#39; is put in so right. It feels like you really there in that moment. Really feelable. And I ain&#39;t even Samoan.

One of the best trailers

The rock GOST

Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw (2019) Director: David Leitch Filming Dates: September 10, 2018 - January 27, 2019 Release Date: August 2, 2019 MPAA Rating: PG-13 [Parents Strongly Cautioned] Runtime: 2 hr 16 min (136 min)

Really enjoyed this. Yes, I know it&#39;s daft, but it&#39;s fun, and Statham and Johnson work well together. The bit where both of them plus their co-star fit into the two seats of a McClaren is hilarious. 🤣🤣

<a href="">3:12</a> such a sick chain grappling sound onto the helicopter

One of my favourite hollywood trailer

&quot;I&#39;m black Superman&quot; best line
Jason Statham makes me horny

Thanks you from israel 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱

Nothing wrong with popcorn action

Deadly movie straight up🔥💯Hobbs and Shaw part 2 plz

THIS is constipated re .......YOUR Wish if like to make sadhguru SMILE in times of TERROR <i>/\</i>

Is there any chance for the part 2 of Hobbs &amp; Shaw?

This is the most stupid movie i ever seen

Samoan Luke Cage teams up with British Agent 47

Here just for Reigns

As ridiculous this series has gotten, you go to admit this is an awesome trailer

this movie is pathetic.  it tries so hard it ends up dragging.  the dialogue sucks.  the action are cliche or just stupid. I like all the actors; plus kirby and elba.  They just don&#39;t have enough original material to work with.  So, it drags.  You&#39;ll wish you hadn&#39;t started it after 1/2 way thru.

This movie 🗑

Who is ready for Fast and Furious: Hobbs &amp; Reyes next year 🤩😎😉😊

Jai salman khan mai pakka muslim
Who&#39;s here after the post credit scene of Fast X?

How could Dwayne handle fighting a man that is bigger than him 😂

Crazy how this movie predicted the covid-19 virus ……if actually watch and listen the whole movie then you’ll understand

Our back following terminator 😂

Love this trailer, the music and editing are perfect together

<a href="">1:56</a> Idris is so Iconic; actually love him!

how much more of this wht trash fast and furious bullshit are we going to be subjected to???!!!!

How did racing some import tuners become this? 😂😂😂

Yes on tonight  and is awesome

he really is Black Superman lmao

This is not Fast &amp; Furious, this is a Terminator movie!

more than a 100 Mil views on the trailer, that&#39;s crazy

This the craziest movie series ever

I wish fast and furious producers would focus on this movie &amp; make it a frenchise cause f&amp;f die when Paul walker die he was a real car peson &amp; the sould of the franchise vin diesel is the opposite he just care about the money thats why i always say the only fast and furious movies worth watching are the first 3.

This is what happens when the fast and furious producers watch winter soldier 😂

Never have seen a movie this short....

Never noticed how <a href="">2:00</a> photoshopped Statham in

Music thanks

How did this get so many views lol

Yaa seriously....first they started the franchise as racing movies and everyone loved it.....then they had lil action.....then they had heist.....then they had cyborgs.....then they had sci-fi techs.....I guess NXT it&#39;s gonna be robots , aliens , space wars.

Honestly, I feel if it wasn’t connected to Fast and Furious, people would like it more.

Love FF since young can&#39;t wait for FastXyourseatbelts F11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

this movie is a big garbage just like fast 9

if you come back to this trailer just to go back to that feeling you had the first time you saw it, you are a legend!

Just one reason I came to here <a href="">#roman</a> reings ❤

Why is this the moat viewed vid on the channel

So that virus is Covid?

With more than $120M views for this trailer, I still can believe that The Rock definitely left the main franchise 😢😢😢

what music do you use for each part of the trailer? i wanna know

every movie with a deadly virus so considerate it always stops at half the population. you dont get viruses like they used to anymore

People don&#39;t realize in plain site the RFID chip used for scanning the forehead to get into the volt is nothing more than the mark of the beast system in the right hand or forehead that is soon coming into existence .

Praise the LORD for creating ionized water!

Great movie. Shame to hear a great tune like time in a bottle ruined , top film all the same .

Mission Imposibble with cars lol

Please Join Kendrick Lamar And Tyga And Jay Rock And Kid Ink Again Please Only Jay Rock And Kendrick Lamar Never Join Fast And Furious Music I Need To Bringing Back Kid Ink And Tyga

I&#39;m cool
Finally, this series got weird enough for me to start watching it..... Well, that, and Helen Mirren&#39;s in it. 😏

122M 😶🔥
think diesel was a little pissed this movie did good because everyone thought it would be a complete flop

I will never understand why people love these type of corny movies

Imagine Brixton&#39;s brother is the next villian in Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2, Michael Jai White would be perfect 👍

<a href="">0:58</a> F&amp;F literally ripped off Thanos

Fast and Furious Presents: Mission Impossible 2 meets Skyfall

Nonsense

I watched the film and after 20 minutes I had to stop. It was literally super shitty. I didn´t even feel the fast and furious vibe.

Beautiful! Amazing 🤣🤣
How did I never see this advertised!

It&#39;s 👍 like Lethal Weapon™ meets 48 Hrs™in Fast &amp; Furious® Presents:Hobbs &amp; Shaw™❤💥🔥👍💯
This is what it means to be manly. Please choose this as my partner. If you have a gun, I can also use it. It’s simple. Fighting with you can help you practice kung fu.

Its all about familyyyyy

was gonna watch this but then I realized I already watched it, thats how forgettable this is lmao

There hasn&#39;t been a bad Fast and Furious movie it&#39;s my favorite series and the Rambo series is my second favorite. Although It sucks to see yal without Paul Walker you guys are doing a fantastic job with this series keep it going. Rip Paul walker praying for all of you god bless y&#39;all keep theses movies coming I love action!

At first it looked like it wasn&#39;t going to be as painfully dumb as fast and furious movies typically are but they got there.

The trailer was better than the movie.

Most dumbest F&amp;F making ever... No tunning cars not street racing...

I typed in &quot;August 2nd&quot; in the Youtube Search Bar, and sorted the results by &quot;View Count&quot;, and this was the top video, with 122,107,554 views as of 08/02/2022 at 12:00 A.M. Eastern Time(U.S. &amp; Canada).

We want rock return as Luke Hobbs 😭🙏🙏

What, I don&#39;t like the scenario, especially when an antagonist act so high and mighty yet depend on hitech.

The best Fast and Furious movie

I wish they make the narratives more like the trailer, better and funnier than the movie.

I watched this movie at imax and it was an amazing experience.  sometimes brainless hyperbole action feels so good

This movie was amazing

This trailer is FUELLED with ADRENALINE!

THE BIG DOG!!!

Aladdin Toy Story 4 Far from Home and Lion King theater and summer 2019 DVD&#39;s like Lego Movie 2 Dumbo and Jungle Rescues

I came here because of AESPA music NEXT LEVEL.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Now I will be getting costco BULGOGI  and KIMCHEE for dinner.
Kon sa move hii
I&#39;m sure thet Fast and Furious 12 will be about robots and Aliens! Fast 13 about Demons!! 😅

I remember how Tyrese cried over this as if his career was over xD

No one asked for more Fast &amp; Furious films! No. 7 was the real Finale to the franchise.

Whr is vin Diesel???
nice movie
The best villain turned into the best anti hero. Jason is a freakin legend.

After end F10 please make hobb and saw next film

If you just like watching racing cars, go watch formula 1

Shown in Before:Cold PursuitFighting with my Family Captain Marvel Captive StateAvengers: Endgame John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum Godzilla: King of the MonstersDark Phoenix (UGH!!!)MIB: InternationalSpider-Man: Far From Home

Idk if anyone thought of this but Hobbs and Locke Ryan and rock

FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY

Yep even a child can see the formula behind these fast and furious franchise now.

<a href="">1:44</a> this is probably the coolest action I have ever seen

way better than f9 tbh

The Original Fast and Furious Ended in Fast and Furious 7 with Brian O&#39;Connor

<a href="">1:53</a> is what really sold it for me

One of the longest trailers EVER!

Anyone still rewatch  the trailer?

Might as well have been a Marvel Studios movie 😂

Good movie

Idris made this very interesting,he makes a great villain

I love that Idris Elba was a little bit turned on &quot;well alright&quot; 😏

Nice movies rock

This movie is all abt great action. I really love it. The villain was also as eqaul in comparison to hero. There is lots of seen which i repeat it again and again.. Dwayne Johnson and Johnson sthalam really great duo.

This film is really cool, just watched the pirated version 😁
I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a move, seeing 100lb women manhandle 200lb men always looks silly to me.

Roman spear 🔥
OOoooooo man, just noticed - the ref to Italian job. nice one :)

Black Superman vs black Adam!

i think the title should Be &quot;Shawn And Hobs From the Fast and the Furious.&quot;

I have no recollection of watching this movie but I did watch it.

even though they show the entire movie in this trailer, got to admit, this trailer is pretty badass.

If Mission: Impossible, G.I.Joe, Fast &amp; Furious, and Transporter had a son

I like these kind of movies.  i likesss

Well I&#39;m pretty disappointed

“look at me i’m black superman” 😂😂😂
On first watching the trailer, i thought this was the 9th fast &amp; Furious. well, as it turns out, this Movie was Basically a Spin-off because the original Fast &amp;furious cast weren&#39;t in it. But I enjoyed it anyway , so not a bad Flick though.

<a href="">2:38</a>  its sounds like a BIG SMELLY FEET

<a href="">0:35</a> LOL

I just watched this move...  This does not fit the Fast and the Furious Mold.  I saw it for Free, but if I was in a Theater I would have walked out...

Just another cash draw. It&#39;s not that good. The banter and cliches are eyeroll-inducing. DJ is a meh actor.

VENOM

Is it just me or does this movie sound like it&#39;s the prequel to what&#39;s going on right now...

Roman reigns scene BOLD Serious
Just watched this on netflix. Man I&#39;ve never eagerly waited so long in my life for tony stark and the avengers to jump out at any moment.. I thought vin diesel was going to come flying from directly infront of the suns rays on his flying V19 spaceship shelby mustang gt talking about something about family

thats were corona came from i see

What is movie name

..... Do you remember that time when the comment section was better than the trailer?

Roman reigns should’ve played the lead brother, closer to the rocks size than the other one.

Salute that man who edit this trailer and sound editing.

Out of all shooting stuff ....I realy like assault rifles bad guys are using ... Croatian made VHS Mod 2 Assault rifles...same Company produces XD,XDM,XDS and HELLCAT ...

If You Smell What THE ROCK is Cookin’ !!

I&#39;m pretty sure that this trailer is not much good edited that&#39;s why it have more views and less <b>likes</b>

Hobbs became The Rock after shaving the goatee

Rip physics!!

It was good movie than fast 9.. had atleast great action 😂😂

<a href="">2:40</a> is the best part

No story no acting, just VFX based fighting

Bloodsport

For the first time Roman Renege looked nice in this film.
I haven’t seen this movie but i bet this is 100x better than fast9! Sadly, Fast9 was such a disappointment big time. 😞 😢

kevin hart should be in ff.. hahah

This movie was 100X way better than fast 9....

Fast and Furious Presents: An Unrelated Film Wanting Money Money Money!

This movie is good but barely shows cars

I don&#39;t care what fnf franchise bring in !! I just want full of action like they have shown in  this movie 😂🤣

This trailer came out on my birthday

Bloodsports origin story looks crazy.

Great film! So much action pretty much the whole way through!

&quot;look at me, I&#39;m a black superman&quot; Literally sent the actual Superman into the ICU.

Sadly I haven’t seen this movie and it’s 2021

any one after rcm promo surya birthday 2020 like here

WTF has this franchise become

Imagine having movie The Rock, Kevin Hart, Ryan Reynolds and Jason Statham would be epic and Trash talking all the time... Hahaha Action Comedy

This movie was better than most FF movies, I might be the only one....

This movie was so goodEntertainingLet&#39;s hope F10 is good one

Top gun Maverick : I can&#39;t believe youHobbs &amp; shaw : <a href="">1:25</a>
the most viewed fast and furious trailer.

<a href="">3:16</a>

<a href="">3:24</a> I laughed so hard

Better than f9 😑

This is my favorite of all the Fast and Furious Movies!!!

Earliest part of trailer along woth bgm is awesome part of trailer

This movie was a badass, even with Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson, Vanessa Kirby and the family

Name of the song?

One of my fav movies

Fast &amp; Furious : Higravity : Bye

You have basically watched the whole movie with this trailer, LOL.

Just watched ,,, in my opinion nothing ever beats the 1st but  this was the dogs bollocks.... 👍

Lot of spoilers 🙄

HULK AND TARZAN

Fast and Furious? Nah. FF ended after TOYOKO DRIFT

Fast and the Furious is about Car racing and crime.. not goddamn future gadgets, future soliders, future cars and space cars and what that ending fights scenes.. its like (1998) &quot;Soldier&quot; where Kurt Russell fight with Jason Scott Lee 😂😂  .. Jeezo worse movie i ever watch 0/5

<a href="">#Idriselba</a> like the bad guy  i don&#39;t know not sound to me

Just watched this on Netflix and i loved it💕💓🔥🥰brilliant

So dumb. No one wants to see two Middle Aged bald guys in action films. They should both be in an old folks home

WORST movie out of them all. great on its own but crap compared to the other ones.

Cmmmmmoooonnnnnnn

Can’t lie this was better than fast 9

Alternative title: The furious Baldies🤩🤩🤩
what a weak virus just half of the pop, get the complete course, Man, get some corona😂😂😂😂😂

Hit me different. When he says I need my brothers

This is the best trailer I&#39;ve seen.

Last scene of him pulling a chain attached to a  helicopter  - nah bro that ain&#39;t happening That&#39;s just pure shit

Impressive

Best actors ever
Thanos much
<a href="">

This one was surprisingly funny. Pretty decent too tbh.

<a href="">1:58</a> Didn’t even happen 🥲
everyone was saying this was stupid. well have u seen F9

its really a narcissistic autobiography movie about the rock and about statham&#39;s spy family

Idris Elda sould play BLADE but people didt know that and he know to marshall art but the people give fly ape about the fans

This is better than F9

😂😂😂😂

🍑💌s
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and please Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 (Not trying to force upon anyone who does not agree.  )

This movie was better than every fast in furious movie except the 5th one

<a href="">

Two gym bros.. One bulk and one cut.. Go against cyberpunk heimdall.. Nice

Hobbs can dance
I’m just here for the black Superman

This trailer literally spoils the entire movie 😂

stupid movie



Also the comment section here is pretty much a strong mixture of &quot;watch this movie free here&quot;and&quot;wow this cam-girl is cheap ...watch her now!&quot;!!!!!!

A virus that could wipe out half the planet? Hmmm...don&#39;t you just love science-fiction * coughs * FICTION!!!!!!

<a href="">2:50</a> thought he is going for a spear

I feel like hobbs and Shaw is the right amount of crazy

<a href="">

<a href="">1:55</a> So J J Abrams directed this DC movie? 😂😂😂

Black superman is really happening 😂😂😂

the movie still makes sense lmao Hobbs and Shaw come from a different world than Dom’s

Watched this movie after a traumatic situation in the icu in lots of pain, it’ll always give me this crazy nostalgia, kept me entertained for sure in there that night,

His mumma got rid of all the guns quick keep her away from John Wick 👹

He called himself black superman well really Henry Cavill come show him the real superman

Haven't seen the movie 🙄🙄🙄
Saw it just recently watched it a couple times

My question is: what happens when Lucas Rebecca Hobbs takes Captain America&#39;s serum?

<a href="">2:37</a> : the music really sync into the movie

Wow. This is serious entertainment. I was wondering what interesting something I would see that adds to it, and I&#39;ve always wanted to see the New Zealand tribal stuff. Love the chest pounding stuff they do as this expression of who they are, because it&#39;s not really conventional &#39;chest pounding.&#39; It&#39;s way cooler. Anyway. Still wondering if this is the movie to watch, today.

Guys, this trailer still gives me goosebumps. It is by far the greatest trailer I have ever seen.The movie itself was so disappointing after the hype of this trailer.

Go see this movie , yourself , not interested anymore, unrealistic things.

2 year anniversary of this AWESOME trailer!

Quote from Fast And Furious - Hobbs And Shaw:



(Luke Hobbs)

&#39;&#39;In life, things happen. You may not want them to, but they do. You just got to do your best and move on.&#39;&#39;



There are things that we don&#39;t want to happen but have to accept, things we don&#39;t want to know but have to learn, people we can&#39;t live without but have to let go. One of the happiest moments in life is when you find the courage to let go of what you cannot change. If we fail to adapt, we fail to move forward.

I know physics was badily murdered in this film but still Hobbs and Shaw is my favorite movie in the entire franchise.

This movie was pathetic 🤔 absolute crap

Outstanding Spin-Off 🌪
I’ve watched the movie after I saw the trailer on tv. The trailer itself is the whole movie down to 3 minutes

A buff and strong boi, a deadly assasin, the white widow, and heimdall all in one movie. This movie should have been called Fast A d Cyborgs CD

I hope Roman Reigns can star in a great film that is no less like &quot;The Rock&quot;

This is the best trailer to a move I’ve ever seen

FAMILY !

A virus which wipe out half of the population hmmmmm never heard of that?  Before🤨

We are all Vietnamese 🇻🇳
How much the samoa scenes gives me the vibes of Moana....

A wonderful and beautiful action movie, a series of films &quot; "Fast and Furious" It has become competitive with other international series such as the &quot; James Bond &quot; And a series of films &quot; "Mission Impossible" And a series of films &quot; Rambo &quot; And other famous ones. But this movie is another independent part that is not related to the “film” series. "Fast and Furious" Despite the presence of famous international stars in it.

<a href="">2:47</a> Roman Reigns just spear in the movie too

I remember back when fast and furious was about street racing now it’s shit and stupid and unrealistic

Don&#39;t need to take any anabolics after watching this trailer.

The trailer views have increased terribly !

I SAW THE MOVIE THAT AMC IT WAS AWESOME MOVIE AND GOT THE MOVIE HOBBS &amp; SHAW ON BLU-RAY BOUGHT THAT THAT BEST BUY FOR $9.99 MOVIE OF 2019 BOUGHT IT IN 9-17-2021

I&#39;v watched this movie and I love it. I&#39;m a big fan of F&amp;F franchises!

Me

I once met Jason Statham a few years ago in, of all places, a supermarket in Clapham. Being a huge fan ( who isn&#39;t) I swallowed my fear and made my way over to him. I said <i>&quot;Im a huge fan Mr Statham, would you mind posing for a selfie with me?&quot;</i> to my amazement he smiled and said <i>&quot;of course not fella&quot;</i> then he put his arm around me in what I can only describe as a &#39;death grip&#39; squeezed me tight and let me take my selfie. Then he looked at me and said <i>&quot;you can call me Jason&quot;</i> to which I replied <i>&quot;thank you Mr Jason&quot;</i> He started laughing and put his face right into mine and jabbed me in the chest with his finger saying <i>&quot;you&#39;re a funny guy&quot;</i> I walked backwards out of that store as if the angels were carrying me.

No need to watch the actual movie because literally all the scenes are in this trailer... you’ll save 2 hours trust me

I just watched it again and is so sick like wtf btw go to genvideos if you want to

Roman Reigns is the real Superman 😎

Who&#39;s Watching in 2021😍

This movie predicted covid 19

The series supposed to be about Dom, gangs &amp; road race. But as the series goes, it slowly deviates to a ridiculous storyline about samoan family &amp; the rock. I don&#39;t like it at all. No wonder nowdays, no one feels excited about the upcoming series. I heard many wwe wrestlers will feature in the upcoming series also. It ruins the entire fast &amp; furious franchise.

Wow, Fantastic Movie this is. I like it

Damn 2 badass characters they should team up with avengers, am rly forward to see somthing

Spiderman after watching this trailer: what the fffffuuuuccckkkk

436 k like this movie trailer  so the movie is good Change  my mind

A deadly virus that can wipe out half of the planet. Sounds like Thanos and 2020 together.

Hobbs and Shaw should be renamed to &quot;Hobbs and Shaw who can cuss who down&quot; Ryan Reynolds , like the guy, but he was more Deadpool humor in this movie. Hibbs and Shaw they really needed get a room.The only one taking the movie seriously was Idris Elba - Brixtonhowever, good action movie.

From Racing to Fighting Superman. Makes Sense. :)

I saw the movie just yesterday........omg....the movie was just full of action .....I liked the movie so much ....and this is now my favourite movie after mission impossible fallout

No toreto no o koner no fast and furious😡😤

Well. Now, optimus and autobot an ally

I&#39;m not really a fan of Hobs and Show. It doesn&#39;t have enough car scenes in it

The virus is spreading now.. Get that girl..

Watch the redo scene if Hobbs and Shaw, it’s pretty awesome y’all, you’ll love it <a href="">

good movi

This trailer is basically the whole movie in 3 minutes and 37 seconds

Was there a black superman in Tokyo drift I didn&#39;t C him or any of this

What happened to just driving cars? Cops and stuff Nope let&#39;s make it least real as possible with black Super man  and other stuff that dosent deal with cars what so ever.   I swear since Paul Walker died it&#39;s gone too far off track so far actually that not even the original characters r in it anymore 😔

Do I have to watch the other fast and furious movies in order to watch and understand this?

I love this movie so much

They revealed in the trailer that it&#39;s his sister. Why are trailers so shit these days?

I&#39;m sorry to Dwayne, Idris, and Jason, but this movie fucks all of F&amp;F movies.

Tell you what fast 9 looks like a mouse infront of this

Fast and furious 20: Dom and his crew have defeated the Justice League and The Avengers during which one or two less important characters died. Now They are hired by John Rambo to go to the future with the help of Marty and Doc from back to the future and get terminators to make an army. Meanwhile, there is a lot of terrorism taking place and Ethan Hunt along with John Wick are sent to kill Dom and his crew in the future. In the future Dom and his crew are fighting against the enhanced version of Tyler Rake and finally when everyone arrives there to kill them and they are surrounded, Dom speaks a shit line about Family and Hobbs and Shaw come in huge trucks banging against everything in their way and then their truck starts levitating in the air because Harry Potter and his friends have come there and then when everything is over, they survive everything and check the truck filled with terminators and find it empty Because George Clooney and Bradd pitt with the other crew members from Ocean&#39;s have stolen it. This continues in Fast and Furious 21

Hey, imagine if someone were to try to hurt the mother of Hobbs. Oh boy, they have a bunch of mussle men comming after there ass. And one things for sure.They gonna dieeeee.

What's the title?
Who all watched the movie because Ryan Reynolds (aka deadpool) was there in this movie

I was infected with genital herpes in 2017 and i have been on the quest for a cure since then. October last year when I almost gave up, I came across a post on the internet where I copied the email of a man named Dr Ehimare who provides herbal solutions to diseases. i contacted him and got to an agreement with him and he sent me herbal remedy through the united parcel service alongside instruction on how to use it. To my greatest surprise, I got healed after 18days of using the remedy as assured by the doctor.I decided to share this because I know that there are lots of people out there that needs help. contact the doctor via his email  drehimareiyoriobhe@<a href="">gmail.com</a> or call +2348050490296 Contact him for remedy for infection like{1}HIV And AIDS{2}Diabetes{3}Epilepsy{4} Blood Cancer{5} HPV{6} ALS{7}herpes ETC....<a href="">

Do they think it was a good idea to put these two actors in a movie where they are partners when they just made a movie of them trying to kill each other a couple of years ago

Was Corona the virus that was gonna wipe out half of the population?

I really only watched this movie cause Shaw is in it lol I don’t mind Hobbs but the rock pisses me off when he makes everything about him that c*<a href="">#t</a> lmao

I was really disappointed with this movie. It could have been a great movie if they stuck to the F&amp;F format.  The whole Samoan family thing was stupid.  It could have been a great sequel if it was thought out better.

funny vines

Lesson from this trailer , watch the movie first as I do

Song name???

han is back = GTA 5 Michael back on prologue.

<a href="">2:17</a> 🔥
JE SUIS BOUJAYGA!LA SAGA!GOG VS MAGOG

ICI LOB DIEU

watch the fast and furious movie clips <a href="">

It really feels like I’m the only one that still loves this franchise no matter how crazy it’s gotten

Even if it went from racing to saving the world from a super soldier from releasing a deadly virusI still love this franchise and this movie

. What a load of shite

instead of Hobbs and Shaw we should’ve got Roman and Tej

I want to like The Rock and Jason.
When the trailer is better than the movie......

Sometimes I think Hobbs and Shaw are in wrong side and the evolution of human is really required right now.

Did anyone else rewatch this trailer over and over?Just me? Ok 🙁

I like the scene when the villan carries shaw&#39; s sister

Is it separate series from van diesel
Can anybody tell me the brand made of the jacket and clothes the motorcycle team wearing ? Not the one by Ildris Elba

Jason Statham (Show) Movies collection

<a href="">

Considering the cast and the cost this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. I am sure if you mentioned it to Ryan Reynolds he would say &quot;Wasn&#39;t Me&quot; The dialog between the two is pathetically unbelievable 3.5/10 and that is stretching it

<a href="">

Is the rock wearing blackface

As i can see in comments, am I the only one that liked the movie;

By far the worst movie ever , they danced,  fight , sun came up plus rain fell all in 30 mins 😑😌 let’s not forget Hobbs stopped a chopper from flying away with his bare hands, the same chopper that lifted four trucks 😒😒

Okk

U MAD BRO

Idris: I am black SupermanThe Rock: Superman does not like magic. SHAZAM!

Eyebrows were plucked nicely for this.

Hey remember when fast and furious was illegal about street racing?

I know him as the meg guy 😎

When the hobbs and shaw 2 show up😭

What happened to all the Nissan GTRs?? 🤣🤣🤣✌

They tease each other like if they&#39;re brothers 😂

idris: a virus that can wipe out half the populationhobbs and shaw: we missed the part where thats are problem<b>2020 arrives</b>awkward silence

Who heared out this:- No way this guy is real @ss-h0le!Answer the down,who said this dialogue?🤔

<a href="">0:35</a> that knocked off baseball cap

Fast and furious female spin off

Idris Elba as bloodsport

The choice of music in this movie is ass and doesnt fit in with the action that is happening

funny to see the entire movie plot was in the trailer

<a href="">

The door is perforated, okay, if the door has spider webs on it inside and dead on the outside, and I opened the door and entered, and the girl knows how to bring back the spider webs that are on the door after they are writhing on the outside and take care of the trap on the outside, oh
Shaw was the enemy now a team He actually kill Tokyo Racer Thats why He is a villain in 7 Guys And I dont really Like villains kill a Good Team and He turned a teammate

Sugarbear and captain delicious pants are in this movie too, if you don’t know what I mean watch Deadpool 2

garbage movie, at least the trailer is fucking good... <a href="">1:34</a>

FX
When u realised the movie predicted COVID19 and also COVID 19 is Black Superman&#39;s kryptonite

But the door is a little safe after the police holiday, but the crowd seems to be broke, so they go to old movies and chat in it, or as usual, they arrange parties for the state or propaganda concerts that they do not publish at all. They always find themselves stored during the time of crisis, when they get angry or do not have a situation, they use the old as a new basis. This is a stupid job. They don't understand the scene, but they understand the scene, because the client sees it all the way to the door and the bed. I mean the theater. I mean, they don't show you an old scene and they show it to you like a scene. You're going to whisper to someone else. No, because someone else is watching from the corner. It's over.
pardon the interruption

Corona virus

This has to be one of the best cut trailers out there

How is this even titled as Fast &amp; Furious? 😂

I came here for the GOOSEBUMPS🔥🔥

Wrestlers will soon take over hollywood😂1.The Rock2.John Cena3.Roman Reigns 4.Ronda Rousey

Say what you want about the movie (which I haven&#39;t seen).You still can&#39;t deny...The music and sound editing in this trailer is 10/10.

Loooooove this movie!!! Jason’s the coolest (especially his accent)

Fun fact, at <a href="">01:56</a> when Idris Elba says &quot;look at me, I&#39;m black Superman&quot; that line was improvised and what&#39;s crazy about is that it actually fits him perfectly 😎

Here comes royal rumbal :0

hit or miss

from drinking Corona to a deadly virus that is similar to corona

Fast and Furious use to be about cars,, and not these Bull crap fake action over the top silly stories, and ps,, there should never be the words Fast and Furious without the great Vin Diesel and the late and wonderful Mr Paul Walker associated with them..

full movie kha milege koi btayga

What is this black panther??

Who is this big guy in the beginning? The actor, he should be like 8 foot

Do I even need to watch the movie now

So the Roman reigns will be upcoming hero of fast saaga

Trailer is mind-blowing.. excited 4 2nd part.... Which virus will wipe out hole papulation.....

Useless ...fuck this kinda ....shit....the rock sucks

Uselss...this is not a fast and furious movie

the film&#39;s a bit trash but this TRAILER. I love

Stupid....really.

They Remind me of Xeno GokuAnd Vegeta a Bad A&#39;S Team

amy schumer
The best movie ever

I don&#39;t know which part of fast and furious is this 🤔🤔🤔😥😥

Ik it’s not fast and furious but I love this

Ima the only one who actually really loves this movie

Who watched the trailer but not the movie yet

aaaw3 rfw43ar w3 r3wr

When he said a virus that can wipe out half the population <a href="">0:55</a> I thought he was talking about the coronavirus 🤣

I&#39;m finna watch this hoe for free on cinehub let&#39;s gooo🙌🏾

Vanessa kirby went from Princess Margaret to Hattie shaw.

Fast and furious was first about racing and now its gta. Its weird. But i still Love the movies

To anyone debating watching this - don’t. It’s a dog shit movie. The Fast franchise was already getting way too ridiculous, but this is just next level terrible. They make The Rock out to be a human superhero, as he is able to free fall several stories and take no damage. There’s an actual superhero because he’s half robot. And the movie is just filled with dumbass Easter eggs.

A virus was it covid-19

Shit the virus got out

I like the film but without the gift it's not the same
<a href="">0:21</a> nice :))
w3r f4w3ear3 f4ewrw3r

Now this is what good story is like chemistry of Hobbs and Shaw level

Brixton was literally scared at the war that he needed a helicopter to escape

Superrrrr

Goosebumps trilor
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s made in 2019 and the women can&#39;t be there without their tits being on everyones face. Has the director considered retiring because this is last decade shit.

I think I just watched the whole movie

I saw the first 40 minutes of this movie....so boring. I love the Rock but I totally hate this movie 😔

I can almost guarantee that this trailer contained all the coolest action scenes and in a movie where the enjoyment of the movie is relying purely on action, they pretty much spoiled the whole movie. For instance i didn&#39;t want to know that they were going to Africa, that would have been a sick surprise.

Thought of seeing this till i watched the trailer.  Nope

Glad I watched the movie before the trailer, otherwise I wouldn’t have had to watch the movie.

I&#39;m so glad i didn&#39;t watched the trailer first!

hiemdal now is the black superman... i thought thanos kill him

Trailer:Jonah hugs HobbsMovie:Jonah knocks him out

Why’s this being advertised now it’s been a year and the movies still bad....

Oh shit this looks good pity hollywood is on my boycott list. Will watch it when I can get it for free until then no thank you

This has to be the wildest trailer I have seen it’s like those action movie parodies you find on madtv

Why is this still being recommended to me

Why’s this in my recommended

Doesnt they have this on Netflix? I couldnt find it

AWESOME FAST &amp; FURIOUS PRESIDENTS: HOBBS &amp; SHAW - OFFICIAL TRAILER #2 [HD] !!!!

Rubbish smh that franchise ended for me in part 4 now it&#39;s a government assassin ninja spy mess what a letdown

The virus thing hasn&#39;t aged well....ya know what I mean

Watch this video 2020 june

<a href="">2:08</a> - looks like he&#39;s doing Bravestone&#39;s smolder once again. This time in a F&amp;F movie.

Hoo hooo making &quot;action movie&quot; about people fears. Doggy

This was the most STUPID movie and i like it .

Honestly Hobbs and Shaw should’ve been rated R but other than that it was one of the best movies ever can’t wait for 2.Are they going to make a Meg 2?

Look at me I’m black superman

I own this movie still haven’t seen it 🤣

Corona..?

I watched this in the US your cinemas are nice better than some of the cinemas in the UK

Never did like Charles Minor

How convenient that we didn’t take the virus as sign to what was going to happen in 2020.

lmao my friend just watched the first movie &amp; i showed her this and she was like&#39; <b>what</b> &#39;

well, after that trailer, I don&#39;t have to watch that anymore.

FAST FURIOUS HOBBS &amp; SHAW | AGENDA GLOBAL 21.. this story is telling us and give a message about this pandemic corona virus and you do a research you will get the answer

<a href="">#QAnon</a> <a href="">#QArmy</a>

<a href="">0:47</a> is a Mw4 map

Y’all wondering what happened to the movie series bc it changed a lot but me thinking about what happened to the second virus that melts your outside

    free f7 GEAR

Hey Everyone! made a mashup music video of this soundtrack.Hope, you&#39;ll like it! 

what happened to Owen Shaw? why is he not in the movie?

This film for pandemi, gates and his friend make this virus

Shaw is like when you unlock the boss as a playable character

Tbh this is such a great movie, i&#39;ve watched this, it was awesome. The only problem is because it has Fast &amp; Furious tittle in it. I mean, for example u can&#39;t put Iron Man yet John Wick is appeared instead, right? Fast Furious has lost its IDENTITY

Jason is elegant and amazing

Isn’t it funny that this movie is about trying to stop a bad guy from getting a deadly virus

Anyone ever thought that they named it fast and furious because Hobbs and shawn are The same characters from fast and furious not some new ones???

this movie is more exciting and  interesting than fast &amp;furious 9

Fucking love Edris Elba!

At this point one has to enter these movies with a fantasy mindset.

<a href="">

Just watched this for first time!! Thought it was gi Joe 3 tbh

Possible the worst film ever jason statham lowerd is standards some of the worst acting I have ever seen

He sounds like thanos <a href="">0:57</a>

Where’s all the original cast is this one just them two

Wait I’ve seen all of the fast and furious movies but not this one whattt???

I was incredibly disappointed in this film. I watched the trailer and from the trailer I was expecting something awesome but got something bland and pathetic. Now I can see why Vin didn&#39;t want another one. They over done it with the CGI. When Paul died it should of been the end of the chapter. I got half way through it and got bored. The Harry Potter joke was NOT funny. It was an insult. As if either of them have even seen the films. Jason statham has a massive ego problem and I can stand him the guy is only good at his Karate shit or whatever he does.. This film was bullshit. We go into the story with immediate action and no narrating, no information on the plot. These guys don&#39;t know tit for tad. It&#39;s a real shame. This movie  could of been good. Sad to say I liked the trailer far much more than the film.

well, I&#39;ve just seen the whole movie in like <a href="">3:37</a> mins. great

I am black superman lol
Since like the 5th movie the series has gone downhill

I like how we&#39;re all coming back during qurantine-

As much as you hate this movie, that double rooms scene is great

Wow its like they didn&#39;t care Roman Reigns was in the movie

No one&#39;s addressing how Ryan and his references are quite hilarious on this? deym

I enjoy the trailer more then movie, cuz everything is in trailer no need to watch movie

It&#39;s not that they are bad characters or the movie wasn&#39;t the best, we just want the other characters back...

Who else came from corona?

can i please have what ever Paul Walker left on Fast Furious minus this two..

Jesus. This fucking movie is a big piece of shit.Just watched it.  Covid lockdown.Wow.  The worse. Who in the fuck actually goes and sees this shit at the theaters.  Omg

Roman got no dialogues ..that was disappointing ...I was eagerly waiting for that throughout the movie

Whole time this movie litttt😭❗️

Was this movie any good?

they got The Rock doing up Native... is this a comedy?

Your sister took something from me. A virus that can wipe out half the population.Covid19: am I a joke to you?Yeah I copied and pasted another comment but mines more relevant now.

Have seen 40 min of the movie and it has nothing to do with fast and furious 🤣🤣

The movies bad
