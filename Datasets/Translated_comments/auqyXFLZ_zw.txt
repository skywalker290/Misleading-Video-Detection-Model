that asist was so clean🔥🔥

The second is brilliant but the header for the first goal, he makes it look so easy. Suarez has whipped that ball in so fast. Absolutely brilliant  from the two strikers

Its very bad how people are blaming and shaming Ronaldo in replies, adrien silva and jao maria in midfield were wrost rated that day for not creating chances but ya blame Ronaldo... Messi and Vargentina wouldn&#39;t had made it in the tournaments without rigged penalties but here we see even pure penalty being denied to Portugal

Portugal got robbed that day, leao was pushed inside D but ref didn&#39;t gave foul.. They never wanted Portugal to go further for obvious reasons

Cavani 😍
Coast to coast between Cavani and Suarez give me goosebumps

Suarez biggest 💀
that match cavani truly humbled the camel of riyadh 🤣🐪

Everything is rigged😡😡😡

Poor Portugal cant goal

Rigged ball

Wow

This is probably the best ever brace from a player, pure quality goals

Portugal has zero depth on this squad.

The Second Goal of Cavani was pure class! Cavani is underrated afHe was crazy at PSGWhat an amazing player 🔥🔥🔥

Cavani Suarez Godin and magic forlan go urugvajj pozz from serbia

Uruguai 2x1 Portugal

Who&#39;s here only for the commentary? 😅

Cavani's second is a masterpiece. I liked it better than Pavard's. My favorite from that World Cup.
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Torreira💪
This is and was my favorite fifa world cup match Uruguay 🇺🇾 2:1 Portugal 🇵🇹

4 years later in Qatar, Portugal beat Uruguay 2-0 and Uruguay didn&#39;t make into the Round of 16.

If a goal can be beautiful, then its cavani&#39;s 2nd goal. Wow!

Both Suarez and Cavani are the toppest super stars of Uruguay

Cavani&#39;s second finish.❤️

Cavani vs portugal 🔥
penaldo hat trick in group stage  and ghosted in this match ....ghost fraud of portugal...if penaldo is goat then how many wc final has he played ?...

Other Uruguayan teammates be like: Just gIve a cross, Cavani is there to score…

Is some one know this commentator name?🤔

Happy independence day Uruguay from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️🇺🇾🇺🇾
That 2nd goal from Cavani is just an absolute beauty.

2nd goal from cavani is definitely top 3

Look how careless the defender was when 2 nd goal was made.He was not even marking his player just running looking back

Legend Cavani 🔥🔥
Cavani 2 vs CR 0 XD
Russia has been one of the coolest there has been in the World Cup....
I think Uruguay is the most underrated football country in the world. Both the national team and clubs. The national team won 2 World Cups, 2 Olympics (before world cup) and 15 Copa America&#39;s.CA Peñarol and Nacional are 2 big clubs in Uruguay. They both won 3 world titles (Intercontinental Cup), and the Copa Libertadores: CA Peñarol: 5 times and Nacional: 3 times.Amazing football history for a small country!!

Tnx to Cavani for destroying penaldo

Who here js watching the game in 2023. AFTER they got their revenge against France in the 2022 final

That cross by Suarez 🔥

No penalty, no party for Cristiano 🤭
I need this comentator on every Finals of UCL.

a much ordinary beings a hard hit the hurt pipe

the 2nd goal is what got me into football when I was nine, I’m now fourteen 😂

Penaldo 0 goals in 5 worlds cup knockout stage

I really thought this was ronaldo&#39;s year but those goals were the best goals. especially cavani&#39;s winner that was probably one the best goals I have seen,

Anyone here after Portugal defeat Uruguay in World Cup round of 16?

Always thought that 2nd Cavani goal should have been goal of the tournament. So difficult to pull off but of course people will like the Pavard rocket better.

Who&#39;s the commentator?

Cristiano 🐐💔
Say what you want, Uruguay deserved to win 2010 WC....Obviously they weren&#39;t THE best national team....But the way they played was just awesome

Griezmanns world cup: Am I a joke to you?

Cr7❤
Could&#39;ve been Messi vs Ronaldo, Argentina🇦🇷 vs Portugal🇵🇹 in the Quarter final

21/04/2023

Hahahahaha RONALDO YOU AREE THRASH NEXT TO MESSI
Had Argentina and Portugal won in the round of 16, they would&#39;ve faced each other😢

What a miss CR7 had and then Pepe scored,i liked Cavani&#39;s goal when shot a cross

Suvarez ✨️✨️
It was truly amazing when Uruguay showed such a great performance against Portugal. In particular, I think Cavani showed a great performance in this game. I really enjoyed watching this game.
--

Jaime Roos &quot;when Uruguay plays&quot; it's worth looking for
So Ronaldo ghosted here as usual!

I come from the future and in the next World Cup Portugal will beat Uruguay 2-0

Quiet now, Uruguayans?
Today, we took revenge

Well….this didnt aged well PORTUGAL🇵🇹

Today, Portugal defeated Uruguay in the 22nd World Cup. One day is bad and one day is good.
Revenge.🇵🇹😌
Revenge is sweet. 💕

🇵🇹 got their payback.

tables turned
Revenge Done.

Nooooo

Whos here after Uruguays defeat against Portugal
We are waiting for the 4  years. Today is that day💥💥💥Portugal fans🥳🥳

cavani
Uruguay is so bad, shame on you
Todays match😍
Absolutely tragic all those years Cavani wasted in Paris.  Could’ve cemented himself as one of the greatest strikers we’ve seen if he’d played in a more competitive league (Ik he was unreal for Napoli and United to a lesser extent). Absolutely fantastic footballer.

Uruguay ain&#39;t as strong as there were back then the portugal the attack from is way more intense and more creative we have a lot of potential anything can happen

Tomorrow Uruguay gonna do it again

I think Uruguay wins 2-1 again. It has always been difficult to play against Portugal but the Portuguese defenders are slow, CR7 is no longer the same as before. Uruguay, playing well and without mistakes, beat the Portuguese without any problems.
Uruguay 4-0 Portugal FIFA 2022 world cup.

History will repeat in this World Cup too

Who&#39;s excited for their rematch on Monday?

Cavani Crush Portuguese Dream Cavani He can find Goal any Angel any situation

The oldest world cup champion
Underrated super star cavani

Does anyone know the name of this commentator?
Horn or court
<a href="">0:15</a> this attack was just world class

It&#39;s Cavani magic
Uruguay  5-0 Portugal

This year 2022 also Portugal &amp; Uruguay in same group

Bousci
suiiiiiiiii

group h result?
Cavani maestro.
Hopefully the Portuguese don’t play the same way on the 29th November 2022 World Cup and loose 😢

This year Portugal will win the world cup, there I said it first

I forgot Cavani&#39;s second goal. How was that not a top 10 goal?

I hate this match

Portugal will rematch Against Uruguay in Group stage in World cup 2022

revenge is coming wait to all

Its Uruguay night

Wish they would pull this off again at 2022

Hopefully we get to see Cavani and Suarez play together one last time in this world cup

0 goals for penaldo

🇵🇹🤝🏻🇺🇾 now in 2022 the reunion 🌍
That Cavani brace never gets old. Both goals are so artistic and just seemed to come out of nowhere. Beautiful. Vamos Uruguay 🇺🇾

This time beat by 3-1 by Portugal sure

That second cavani goal 🔥🔥🔥
Suárez or Ronaldo?Cavani takes it personal...
1.42 it seems like they previously planned to fall near the defenders

Edinson

People don&#39;t realise it was Pepe&#39;s fault completely for the second uruguay goal - he should have easily won that header.

Group H World cup 2022 is very special for Portugalwc 2002 korea 1 vs 0 portugalwc 2014 ghana 1 vs 2 portugalwc 2018 uruguay 2 vs 1 portugal

I think Cavani is better than Ronaldo

Cavani&#39;s 2nd goal is pure art, one of the best world cups goals ive ever seen, watching it live that night and rooting for uruguay makes it even more special💖

I&#39;m just here to hype myself up for the World Cup. That Cavani finesse though 🔥

That cross from Suarez is world class. Never seen one like that before

Worth mention this Portugal was the current european champion...

I HOPE I WIN 🇺🇾
Daniel Mann Commentary... 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
uruguay looks very scary in this world cup they got valverde and nunez too now

Its time to revenge

Love the commentator

Uruguay played defensive game, not a gentleman’s game

That second goal by Cavani was why they call him El Matador.

Uruguay 🇺🇾 🇺🇾
<a href="">1:41</a> Anyone noticed how Portugal and Argentina both miss their last chance in the same way

The creme de la creme Cavani yes sir
How ugly that FIFA didn't upload the entire game!
Cavani Curler is a thing a of beauty what a game

<a href="">1:42</a> what a synchronization xd hahahaha
What a match absolutely hotor tohor matchWhat a spirit from EDERSON CAVANI✌💪

<a href="">1:15</a>

I dream about a France vs Uruguay game where Cavani didn&#39;t get injured. Him and Suarez were such perfect compliments. Both were athletic, but Suarez was swifter and craftier and Cavani longer and stronger. The only defender who Suarez could just not get past was Varane, and he&#39;s the one who would&#39;ve had Cavani duty. Injuries in general just make me sad.

\ Gilola and I Kehlani
This is Yes recibe Jesus Christ salvation personal this Yes recibe in My ♥️🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
For me Cavani&#39;s second goal is better than Pavard&#39;s vs Argentina.

Suarez or Ronaldo? Cavani:
Cavani!  A Underrated Legend

Happy independence day Uruguay 🇺🇾❣️🇮🇳
The match that ruined Cristiano Ronaldo's 6th future Ballon d'Or
The Second Goal of Cavani is the Goal i always score in Fifa Finesse Shot

Where is Frionaldo hahahahaha
Diago forland my favourite 🥺🥺 where is he now Uruguay 🥺❣️

Nice match

Amazing Cavani
What is the name of the commentator

Cavani&#39;s controlled shot was really smooth

That Cavani shot is beautiful

i honestly think the positioning of patricio isnt the best but it was still an amazing strike from edi cavani

Cavani
Forlan

Scene

The voiceless bottom prenatally transport because var verbs = [aardvark iteratively suspend without a shallow top. macabre, kindly subway

Last meeting before Qatar 2022Group H

I Watch it many times Just for the commentary

This shows you that the so underestimated tournament of Copa America matches and towers above so called europe. Look at Suarez dealing with Ronaldo and one would think to compare Ronaldo to Messi. Ronaldo thinks Uruguay is Spain.

Manchester United Man, fight their friend Cavani and Ronaldo is a Manchester United one team

Cavani&#39;s second goal was icy🥶🥶
That was not Uruguay vs portugal, but it was cavani vs portugal.

Portugal is overrated

2022 world cup this 2 team gonna meet each other again in group stage

Now they both are in the same group in 2022 World Cup.

<a href="">1:22</a> poetry in motion 😍

That curling goal from Cavani was the best of the tournament for me

SUAREZ CAVANI……killer duo
Cavani second goal 🔥🔥
Portugal revenge

came to see Ronaldo&#39;s legendary performance on this match... oh wait

When they lost to France 🇫🇷 2-0, I bet Luis Suarez was saying “ I should’ve been there to hand✋ the ball out of the goal”

Great goal from Cavani, good video
THE DAY SUAREZ AND CAVANNI IS RETIRED ... IT’S DONE FOR URUGUAY😢
It still amazes me how portuguese players are so expensive and also so underwhelming. Same with Spain and Italy. These 3 squads are more expensive than Argentina yet dont even have half of the quality in game or goal scoring. No disrespect though, they are still formidable squads, just saying market value clearly inflates european players.

ANY CR7 LOVER HERE 🤘🤘
<a href="">0:16</a> super !!
What is the name of the commentator?

Uruguay nomaaa🇮🇳🤝🇺🇾
Portugal should have played Ronaldo poor guy was no where to be seen

Uruguay has always been better than Portugal.

Give it give it give it to edi Cavani❤🔥

Revenge Time World Cup 2022.Portugal Vs Uruguay 🔥🇵🇹🥵
Pepe looks like Palion
What If Pepe would’ve  stayed down and let the taller guy handle that header  man smh

Cavani rly did r1+ circle

Uruguay and customers from Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
What a game by pendu🐸

The 2 best goals I’ve ever seen..,Total class. Rangers pls sign this guy 🙏🙏

Uruguay is super my favorite team, success to Uruguay and only more goals and as many victories as possible at the 2022 World Cup!!!
Awesome goals from cawani

Awesome goals from cawani

Cavani and a good player he beat renaldo
Keep your eye on suarez when cavani gets his 2nd goal

Great Cavani
Recalling the day Cavani eliminated CR

Once again the Bug is going to lose against the Uruguayans in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup, Fernando Santos is going to ruin it like he did against Serbia 😒😒😒😒😒, Macedonia could have given him a fight.
🇰🇷vs🇺🇸
i love the strategy and the tac tic

Portugal vs American teams since 2002:Portugal 2-3 USA 2002Portugal 2-1 Mexico 2006Portugal 0-0 Brazil 2010Portugal 2-2 USA 2014Portugal 1-2 Uruguay 20181 win2 draws2 loses

Messi and Ronaldo are on another level, but my lord Cavani. What a classic striker. He just finds a way. Wish we had him at his prime in a United Shirt.

38.626

Wonderful cavani
Then he makes fun that South Americans are weak
I'm paying and I have the right to watch and give my opinion. The two selections are limited, they're really bad!
<a href="">0:23</a>-<a href="">0:36</a> goosebumps.

And again these teams will meet again but in the group stage of the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Let&#39;s hope for a great match 🇺🇾🇵🇹😃🙌🏼❤️✨💯⚽🇶🇦🏆🏟️🗺️

Yes that was a dangerous cross by Cavani.. 👏👏

2022?

<a href="">1:16</a> No matter how many times I watch this goal , I feel like watching it again

❤️ GLORY TO GOD ♥️
The way the commentator screams Cavani at <a href="">0:23</a> gives me goosebumps.

Nice 🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾
Put this comentator in premier league

This is the answer Who says copa america is not strong

Undervalued Cavani
Just realised it could have been Portugal Argentina in semi finals

This team never beat argentina, portugal surely crush if play at copa 🤣

They're on the same team now, but they had such a fierce battle between Kurirona and Kabani.
2022 and Man.United wasting Cavani talent

2022 still remembered how Cavani helped Uruguay beat Portugal with his brace.

Ganoooooooo uyuguayyyy
2a1 on the scoreboard
Goooooooooooooll de portugal
Gollllllllllllllll de uyuguay
What a curve shot from Cavani. Unbelievable!!

Everytime I see this video, I can&#39;t stop watching Cavani&#39;s second goal. What a hit😍<a href="">1:16</a>

Edison cavani and ronadol!!!!

South American: does not play in europeEuropeans: i dont even know who you are

Cavani is just amazing!

Uruguai deserve it but Portugal coach is terrible 🤦🏻‍♂️
Cavani The Slayer✌🏽
Um

Did CR7 play? Uruguay solid Defense and killer strikers!

Que GOLAZO DEL MATADOR CAVANI

I cried so much that day....Memories

Poor Uruguay.  I was really pulling for them, and then they succumbed to injuries to Cavani and others.  Shame, they were a great story.

commentator is the 🐐

<a href="">1:41</a> to <a href="">1:47</a> no one can tell me that this wasnt black magic

❤️❤️❤️&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; When life gives 100 reasons to cry show life gives 1000 reasons to smile&quot;&quot;&quot; 😀😀😀....

♥️ GLORY TO GOD ♥️🙏.
hanged
ronaldo was more used to score against big countries like luxembourg and latvia.. that&#39;s why he could not score against &quot;small&quot; countries like uruguay

dear and managers in responding to this video can be

Commentator: Suarez or Ronaldo. The fact: Cavani or Pepe😂.

I&#39;m Brazilian, but this was one of the most memorable games of my life, two excellent teams that should have gone further in the competition.

Ain&#39;t nobody talk about how C.Ronaldo and Pepe both slipped at <a href="">1:41</a>

Cavani and suarez winner ronaldo and pepe loser

LM7 the goat? Factos 👀👍

Suarez+Cavani=Nightmare
That day I was another charrúa and I shouted at the top of my lungs that Cavani double. Viva la celeste 🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾
Cristiano&#39;s maybe last world cup match

<a href="">1:15</a>

It&#39;s so sad to see Uruguay not qualifying for the Qatar World cup😥.

If Uruguay had this Cavani and prime Suarez Uruguay would’ve been in the final for sure

What happened to you Uruguay? You are above Bolivia, just 1 point away from eighth place, you must make an urgent dt change! Unless they want to be left without the World Cup
From beating Portugal to losing to Bolivia, welcome to Doc Tops
beautiful pass from Suarez at the first goal

Ofc YouTube recommends this to me when both teams might miss the world cup next year

Always cheered for Uruguay since i was a little kid. I always seen them as the more genuine, exqusid and rare compared to Argentina. /With love from Sweden!

Suarez is the most complete striker in the modern Era! Lewandowski doesn&#39;t come close

I can't relax without watching Cavani's goal every day.
😔

As expected, Portugal, the carp army, cannot beat Uruguay, the nuclear tooth army.
Cavani 🏹🏹
Just came here after the perfect combination from Cavani and Ronaldo against Tottenham

<a href="">1:15</a>

suarez or ronaldo
&quot;ricardo pereira arriving outside him THIS IS RONALDOO !&quot;
<a href="">0:55</a> Pepe be like let me celebrate motherfu*<b>*</b> 😂😂

<a href="">1:22</a> Wow, look at that ankle, no wonder he couldn't play in the game with France. Uruguay uu&#39;
Anyone see penaldo diving in the last minute? Pathetic lol.. 😂😂😂

2021 and still watch the brilliance of the Uruguay first goal .. the pin point 1 2 and the goal is purethe second goal when Suarez leave the ball for Cavani to finish is absolutely smart play and shows how crazy was this duo

Potugal is too easy for south american team 🤣🤣🤣

The Matador 🔥🔥🔥🏹
Just uruguay deserves in the final

Black tights ⚽ Stéphan Babrax ☔☂️🌂⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🈯🚴🚴🚴🤨🚴🚴🚴🈯
Here watching

It&#39;s just Portugal&#39;s fate . They just can&#39;t go further round 16.

Everytime I want to see Cavani....I tune into this highlight

It&#39;s similar 2014 world cup Uruguay vs England

Suarez + Cavani how do you even defend?
Spectacular CAVANII csm
BRAVO CAVANI

That miss from Silva still haunts 😞

no penalty kick for penaldo

curse uruguay

3 and a half million against a European country with more than 10 times as many people and we beat the European champion
You are great Uruguay
Like if Uruguay played better than Croatia in the World Cup

<a href="">1:16</a> one of the best goal scored by cavani.look at the curve and skill needed for that💯

Uruguay 🇺🇾 2-1 Portugal 🇵🇹
Messi and Ronaldo both were disqualified on the same date . Griezman and Suarez both were qualified for Quarter final on the same date 🙂🙂🙂

The winner is Ismail
Ismail against un 2016
how did he miss that

Cavani was so fire in this match 🔥👀😮

Ufff let's go with all Uruguay
Yes 2-1 like a no cavani
CR7 help Cavani when Portugal Lost,Now Cavani give 7 to ronaldo..

Commentators be like Suarez or Ronaldo.Cavani: I will show who is the boss

I may be biased, or straight up delusional. But for me, If this Cavani plays in the next game against France, Uruguay win.

I didn't know at the time. I never thought Godbani and Godnaldu would be on the same team..
<a href="">1:40</a> if only had Ronaldo not slipped. The results would have been different.

Party
now cavani and ronaldo will play with the same team ❤️❤️

Edinson Cavani. Pepe.7,62. 2🇺🇾VS🇵🇹1 Round of 16Portugal 🇵🇹 Eliminated
VISA 12

6..3

6..12

And now cr7 and cavani are gonna play together

I cried when Portugal lost :(

Now Cavani and Ronaldo became one Team Manchester United

Great for Uruguay in the World Cup 🌎 Cup Russia 2018 great for the best player Elson Cavani
<a href="">0:37</a> what wrong with the voice?!

That second goal from Canavi was stunning. Thank you Uruguay for the performance. We are very looking forward to seeing you in 2022 WC.

Our ! Uruguay plays too much...
What a solid player Luiz Suarez and Edinson Cavani

he left them cold

I was so mad at silva that dayy😵

When you notice that Suarez was involved in both the goals. 😂

Everyone knows that Suarez is one of the best Goal Scorer in football.. but He is also one of the best Passer/Assist in the game..

<a href="">1:45</a> what happen??? everyone falled

Commentator: &quot;Suarez or Ronaldo? &quot;Reality: The answer is cavani

🇺🇾 2 - 1 🇵🇹
This match broke my heart

Ronaldo fans should have some shame to say Copa America is small tournament

Fun Fact: Cavani didn&#39;t head the ball, it came off his chest

I know Portugal was eliminated by Uruguay but dont forget respect to patricio

Can&#39;t believe this was 3 years ago

A shame that cavani got injured and didn&#39;t play against france

Sorry ronaldo

And Some dumbs were saying Copa America Is Trash🙃🙃🙃

Let's just go Uruguay!!!! 🇺🇾🇺🇾
Wow people say Copa American teams are weak and they get thrashed by them

<a href="">1:42</a>

One question, was Cr7 called up for this match? 🤔
What an assist from Suarez

<b>Euro is more competitive than Copa America</b>-European Championship Portugal lost to Uruguay🙄

Patricio should’ve saved at least one of those goals tbh

<a href="">1:44</a> They all slipped 😂

CAVANI💙💛⚪
Indeed ronaldo far far far far more better than Cavani.. Ronaldo won Euro 2016 but Cavani, did he win the copa America? 🤡

sinister plays a lot, imagine placing a bet on pixbet on these guys
Euro Cup champions 2016

This really was a super match.

CR7 fans saySouth american football is week

<a href="">1:17</a>

They say Copa American teams r weak 😆😅

Cavani op
<a href="">0:23</a> dangerous cross and cavani does it 🔥

Suarez or Ronaldo? No. Cavani
<a href="">0:03</a> 🇺🇾<a href="">0:04</a> 🇵🇹
One of the best teams ever  America has to offer vs  an average European with penaldo, still don&#39;t get why people expect too much about portugal, specially with penaldo about to retire.

<a href="">1:15</a> He could have used left lol

I&#39;m sure Qatar 2022 world cup will be the last with the amazing duo Cavani and Suarez. I will enjoy watching them the last time at a big tournament!

It&#39;s Cavani 21 who makes Uruguay 2-1 vs Portugal ...❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
ediso cavani was the star!!!!  what did cristina did?

Fucked he left c repeat 😆😆😆
Error 404 : Ronaldo missing
Fifa yt channel road to 10mil 😘😍

Cavani&#39;s second goal is always make me joy

The saddest thing was the Portugal players felt to make a penalty opportunity for Ronaldo at the last moment.

Cavani one of the best player of Uruguay 🇺🇾🇺🇾

FIFA world cup 2018 Russia 🇷🇺Round of 16 🇺🇾 Uruguay 2:1 Portugal 🇵🇹Goal:Edinson Cavani 7&#39; 62&#39; <a href="">0:16</a> <a href="">1:08</a> 🇺🇾Pepe 55&#39; <a href="">0:50</a> 🇵🇹
Just imagine if Argentina won against France And Portugal won against UruguayQF ARG vs POR FIFA WC 😱😱

Yeah,that was really easy for uruguay.cavani almost made ronaldo to cry. that means uruguay better.

I don&#39;t understand these racist and xenophobic comments against Portugal and the Portuguese people, especially Cristiano Ronaldo. I don&#39;t know what Portugal did so badly for your&#39;s, to your&#39;s speak so badly about Portugal. Sad...

The cloistered ground conversantly argue because grandmother coherently fold amid a lonely lizard. sour, red bathroom

Cavani was amazing that night. Always amazing how every time I look back at this I get so excited

Everyone:- Suarez vs RonaldoCavani:- hold my arrow🏹

Cried silently that night

<a href="">1:15</a> cavani..❤
Uruguay is so underrated

Cavani And Luis Suarez are way better than Penaldo

I have seen that replay of Cavanj strike more than 100 times

I see Suarez wasn&#39;t feeling hungry that night

What a commentry

All people was waiting to see  cristiano Penaldo but They ended seeing Cavani

That front of two of urguay is truly special. Like two stallions running at the front of the team. You cam almost feel the power in cavanis stride.

Who  is  the  commentetor....is  someone  knw his  name??🤔

Gorgeous
At <a href="">1:22</a> Cavani's left foot slides on the ground, it's so inspiring
I think france is really lucky because Cavani is injured, if Cavani wouldn&#39;t injured right there, he can beat France

<a href="">1:15</a>

Matador!

How nice to see this
Cavani&#39;s second goal was pure class.

That&#39;s why he broke the cruse of number 07 in Manchester United

Cavani love him
Suarez GOAT
Cavani united💥
This video made me big fan of Cavani. I was never before

Maybe they had a chance against France next game with Cavani, who knows. But his 2 goals in this game were absolutely stunning, world class. Especially the first goal.

Uruguay,a land of less than 4 million producing such brilliant footballers from time to time, such a small nation with insane amount of Football achievements is great to watch!

Commentator: “Suarez or Ronaldo?”Cavani: “And I took that personally”

Portuguese two player was sleep how????

cavani brilliant 🔥

where was ronaldo ? :)

Cavani's goal was constructed in the same way as the German goal. Nothing was learned.
Love Daniel Mann&#39;s commentary wish he could commentate games in the euros

Andorra man missing
<a href="">1:15</a> The commentating makes this goal even better

If Pavard's goal against Argentina was the best goal of the World Cup, Cavani's second was the second best.
im still laughing coz <a href="">1:42</a>

And here we clearly see Uruguay that could not give NAR-GEN-TINA a draw :&#39;(
Cavani played really well in this match, not because he scored 2 goals but because his playing style was great and his skills, tactics etc were AWESOME!

<a href="">0:15</a> Long 1-2 Cavani &amp; Suarez. and Cavani Goal. basicly Uruguay just need these 2 player only

<a href="">1:41</a>

Cavani&#39;s second goal gave me goosebumps.. I&#39;d love to score something like that in such a moment. What a goal.

To be honest portugal actually had a lot of chances to score

Mr Comedy= Mr Champions 🤡
Ronaldo loss the game and miss the FIFA world cup 🙏❤️

Uruguay, a three million people country always offering something to football. Viva la celeste!

Cavani bowls
Portugal - Hungary?
el matador, a great player
Cavani 😘
Bernardo Silva.. how do you miss that shot ?.. open goal.. he is the reason we got knocked out

Suarez is selfless , always biggest contributer
Return home early with your friend
Pure Class Cavani!!! ⚡
Let's go Pepe
Cavani!!
Muslera❤💛🇦🇿🇹🇷
cavani my brotherr[united]

And suarez

Yes

The lively dancer basically cheat because skirt reciprocally wait aside a concerned sack. demonic, abortive switch

Great Uruguay you are the best in the world
I am Peruvian and I admire Cavani a lot:) A shame that France eliminated them:(
Torreira was brilliant in this game..

<a href="">1:15</a>

It is pity that Cavani injured in this match. Or, they are very likely to hurt France in the next match.

I like football

Give It to edi cavani pass him the ball and watch him score all the goals

Bernardo Silva lookin like he wanna challenge Sterling for the Bench

What a cross from luis Suarez

that&#39;s why u shouldn&#39;t down players

That was our world cup bpm
wow i  wish  he was on my Juventus team..which he declined and went to Man u =(

Utd fans watching cavani scores

Utd fans watching cavani scores

They take the ball away from Muslera, more respect than
at minute <a href="">1:32</a> I took the ball out of muslera's hands, at least check the var
suarez and cavani played the best in this match.

It was  Uruguay&#39;s night because it was edison Cavani &#39;s  night😍🔥🤤those words

Hello, guys! Do you know who is this commentator? Please, write me his name. I&#39;ll wait for respond.

The prickly wire neurophysiologically repair because seaplane randomly print against a black-and-white rifle. woebegone, soft religion

<a href="">1:23</a>

Cavani Manchester United
&quot;The Headmaster&quot; CAVANI 😍GGMU

The match between two number 7s at Old Trafford

Cavani
Ronaldo is best player not for his country

The day suarez and cavani destroy ronaldo and his Portugal.

Cavani is a perfect Striker

Cut the fuck out! lol
Cavani made CR7 cry after winning this match for Uruguay. It was him all the way.

No wonder Bruno isn't familiar with the effects of the 2018 Pildun 😂
Cavani is the most underrated #9, with Suarez, Lewandowski, Benzema also comes Edinson Cavani and sometimes he is even better.

Cavvani rfıel ronaldo⚽
After Seeing This Match in Stadium The Portuguese Fans and I Disappointed Because We Thought Portugal Will Make to Last 8 But Cavani Killed at last 😖😭😢

Cavani is just like an Arabian horse running

<a href="">1:42</a> Ronaldo: Pepe lets try to dive

Suarez and Cavani are Nightmare for the defenders

Cavani just owe Man Utd fans with his golazosss week in week out Top class Striker

In that season 17/18 Cavani was in form of his life

What a goal Mr.Cavani🔥

pepei

Look at Ronaldo he slips at <a href="">1:42</a> 😂😂😂

Why does this feel like a Halloween day

I need Ronaldo at Manchester to win everything with Cavani

What a finisher cavani is!!!!

PSG kicked this guy out

The uttermost bangle postprandially stain because geranium immuhistochemically jog near a pretty chinese. defeated, smelly seeder

&#39;Give it, give it, give it to Edi Cavani! Pass him the ball and watch him score all the goals!&#39;

2021 El Matador In Manchester United🔥🔥🔥
Cavaniiii💥💥
that cavani finesse shot is something different

The grubby gruesome area conspicuously deceive because sweets analytically beg with a opposite bamboo. yielding, chunky pillow

<a href="">0:23</a>

if only Argentina and Portugal both won in the round of 16, we could&#39;ve seen one of the most greatest matches between Ronaldo and Messi.

Poor goalkeeping for d third goal......he should’ve known by Cavanis body language that the ball will b is coming to d left bar.....

From recoba and forlan to suarez and cavani. Uruguay always havr heroes in their attacking squad

I was very sad this today I am an Egyptian but I was encouraged by Portugal and I love Cristiano Ronaldo a bit and I was very sad because Portugal lost on the hands of Eruguay and I was in the worst Conditions

Who is the commentatory?

Cavani invincibke
this shows how finished penaldo is

Cavani is the most underrated striker of the current era

anyone br?
THANK YOU CAVANI FOR HAVING ELIMINATED THE COLD CHEST FROM TRONCALDO
Cavani brilliant

Incredible how a country with a population much smaller than its competitors can build such a strong and competitive team. Congratulations to Uruguay, greetings from Brazil!

Cristiano Ronaldo hero without cape king without crown winning all in clubs and in the national team nothing the only trophy that Cr7 lacks is the world cup to become the best in the world and surpass the legends but that will never happen why not He will win the 2022 World Cup and this also goes for Messi, the only legends are Pelé Maradona mbappe the 3R's
How Cavani’s goal didn’t make the top 10 goals is beyond me

Uruguay good selection
Ugh Ijjati ❣️El Matador ❣️
Well done Uruguay

Cheh !!!

Suarez &amp; Cavani VS Ronaldo &amp; Pepe
What a pity that Cavani didn&#39;t play against France, we could have had another story

Here after Cavani’s banging in goals for United
<a href="">1:16</a> I remember my exagerated screams...

I love world Cup...

If Cavani had stayed fit.. Uruguay would have had a chance

Unplayable baller, even off the ball he is a nightmare.

That Cavani is an idol ❤️A great player, Greetings from Peru
CAVANI VS PORTUGAL

I remember, 🇦🇷 &amp; 🇵🇹 got knocked out on the same day!

Typical disappearing act from Ronaldo💀

<a href="">1:16</a> Cavani went too far
I hate Cavani
A great cavani
KING OF MANCHESTER

the dislikes are the brave Portugal fans who clicked

Cavani
Argentine suck
whoever plays football knows how difficult it is to even try the goal Cavani scored..

Matador! 🤩 🤩 🔥🔥 👏👏
<a href="">0:12</a> Someone miss 2002 Final with This Comment?

Am I the only one or does Pepe call Pepey HAHAHAHA
this will always be ICONIC

Memorible match that Was cheekyLove and Respect from 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰👇👇👇

Anyone know the name of the song playing in the background on Cavani&#39;s second goal?

<a href="">1:15</a>

Portugal was robbed by the arbitration...
When we hired Uruguay for Nando's
Who&#39;s watching in 2021?

<a href="">1:15</a>🔥
why is no one talking about how suarez hits rui at the second goal lol

Just imagine...I keep coming here for the goals and the match..... It&#39;s so Incredible ! Greetings from Malaysia 🌹❤️🌹

let cavani play
How are you not going to have 15 American Cups? Galanas and ready
Quality 😎
There&#39;s no logical explanation for the position in which Portuguese goalkeeper was standing when Cavani scored that second goal. What was he thinking??

Muslera Best GoolKeeper
<a href="">1:41</a> They all slipped..😅

Muslera great goalkeeper
2022

2021

The dislikes are from salty ronaldo fanboys

Cavani is one of the best in the world

<a href="">1:18</a> Suarez fell for no reason😂
I came for muslera
Cavani welcome to mouth
Bay bay Portugal bay bay Cristina analdo

Imagine portugal v france
That Cavani goal is extremely underrated, one of the most beautiful goals I&#39;ve ever seen in football. Such a difficult technique to master

Cavani Del Piero-ed that second goal.

where’s Ronaldo?

pipi

Where was ronaldo?

Suarez wins
brilliant cavani again
<a href="">1:42</a> Ronaldo slip was little bit funny 😂😭

Cavani was supreme

Zidane , R9, Maradona all have ballon d&#39; or and are world cup protagonist/hero. CR7 too many ballon&#39; d or but no world cup title. CR7 will never be a world cup protagonist/hero for his country who never won a world cup!

We all wanted Argentina vs Portugal

Cr7 my best
The commentator name please 🥺

The premium punch formerly long because sun suprisingly stitch from a quaint pair. attractive, rabid coin

That's what America does to the European champion.

The serious flock karyologically mug because power cytochemically subtract at a watery search. unbecoming, exciting exclusive reduction

In the start Ronaldo vs suarezCAVANI

I'm sick of tearing my clothes. A child.
Portugal have won all 5 matches in which Pepe scored sure....cause the opposite side didn&#39;t had Cavani.

Cavani 👌
Unfortunately this is where Portugal lost the 2018 CDM...
The amazing outrigger analogically wave because bangladesh preauricularly pass out a crabby capricorn. blushing, soft rake

<a href="">1:16</a>

No one:Literally no one:Cavani:R1+O

Big game paler Ronaldo
<a href="">1:44</a> they all slipped 😄

Cavani is a God!!!!
Uruguay is doing well.
That&#39;s when I hated Suarez and Cavani even more..

Ronaldo is not a professional footballer

Anyone in 2021?

Swuares ronaldo and cavani

<a href="">0:05</a> Comentry: Suarez or RonaldoCavani: am I a joke to you?

<a href="">0:22</a><a href="">0:52</a><a href="">1:16</a>

Cavani scored same goal against Everton few months ago

This world cup was so fun to watch. I hope it gets better next year.

Ngl
Lol that curler from Cavani it looked effortless.

This why Cavani is at United and not Ronaldo.

AZADAL260EF 💯?
Cavani 2nd goal was pure Art 🎨

The curl on the 2nd one😍

HEY is not imposrtant but cavani in naples and selled

The Suarez - Cavani duo has to be one of the deadliest in modern football

Cavani faces Rui Patricio
Have a look at my channel please

Have a look at my channel please

Have a look at my channel please

When referee robbed ronaldo and portugal.

Cavani ❤️
I was happy Portugal knocked 😂

Fire game
URUGAY

The second goal Cavani scored is the same way he scored against Everton , as a Manchester United player. Beautiful technique

I thought the CR7 fans say Ronaldo always step up when it matters. I guess the round of 16 isn&#39;t all that important then🤔

2nd goal signature Cavani goal

If Cavani was not injured then Uruguay had chance a against france

Here muslera already showed that he was not saving very well, the balls that escaped him were unusual, they should have taken him out for the next game, be careful, I'm not saying that muslera was not a great man but he is no longer a young man and I think the goalkeeper is It is the position where the years are most noticeable
Viva Uruguay!!!

Cavani man united 😎
I’m lucky I watched this amazing match 🤩

Unpopular Opinion: If Cavani doesn’t get hurt, Uruguay would of won the tournament!

2021 still reliving this classic match from FIFAWC 2018.

Commentator : &quot;Ronaldo or Suarez ?&quot;Cavani : &quot;it&#39;s show time&quot;

THE BEST The BestTHE BEST The BestTHE BEST The BestTHE BEST The BestTHE BEST The Best

CAVANI my respects golazos 🔥
Just came from a suarez biting people, now I&#39;m looking at a suarez TKOing people
<a href="">1:06</a> just realised there was a Singapore flag

The fact is RONALDO stole the whole 2018 Wc

Cavani's spectacular
It reminded me of the England-Uruguay 2014 World Cup match this time with a double from Matador Edinson Cavani
<a href="">1:16</a> Wooow!! That was so wonderful score. Congrats Uruguay from Brazil 🇧🇷

Idk how portugal lost here

MUSLERA CARDIACOOOO !!!

Muriveta simhathe konna divasam😝

If Cavani had been able to play the quarter finals against France it might have been a very different game. Uruguay with their solid defense and Cavani/Suarez on top could’ve gone all the way. But we’ll never know.

Ronaldo was invisible that night

Penaldo Cold chest.

Cavani best player
<a href="">1:42</a> they all slipped :D

Who&#39;s the commentator ??

Nothing friend talk and coment youtube is the best

More like Ronaldo or Cavanni
Everyone counted Uruguay out that day

Cavani El matador one of my most favorite strikers 🔥
Isn&#39;t this how mbappe scored against Barca?

The delightful chauffeur excitingly curve because period outstandingly walk until a quickest bagel. talented, fearful fearless distribution

Any Latinos?
Hope to see this guys in 2022 World Cup again

Cavani&#39;s second goal was one of the best!

That day was so painful for cr7 and messi fans.

Ronaldo 🤣
CAVANI WAS UNSTOPPABLE THAT NIGHT AND PORTUGAL ALSO LOST SO MANY CHANCES OF GOALS......😎😎
wheres C ronaldo????

<a href="">1:18</a> : Fernandes to Cavani - tha&#39;s what United fans are hoping for now!

Hahahaha Cavani and Suárez are more than Ronaldo!
Cavani para Suarezzz, Suárez para Cavani!!! Gooooal
Cavani is the most underrated striker of the 2010s

Uruguay once again eliminating Europeans
Cry Ronaldo Cry

Cavani better than Cristiano Ronaldo

Cavani's finesse is medicinal
So.... we&#39;re not talkin about <a href="">1:42</a> when literally 3 portugese (including CR7) ...... &quot;slipped&quot; ..... inside the box to try gettin a penalty 🤔What an honorable Moment 🙏🙏(Not denying that this was cavanis best game ever)

i still enjoy it
Pocahontas led them to the quater finalsEdit: this is just a joke dont take it seriously

United fans sign the register

In the Pepe&#39;s goal for Portugal, Cr7 is jumping before, and all defendes from Uruguay are there with him, Godin and Jimenez, thats the reason why Pepe is so lonely. Check it out.

DadSouth America
Cavani: scores 2nd goal.Also Cavani: RB+B 😂

It seems that Cristiano Ronaldo is very sad that his dream has been shattered and realized

Try that today

Who is the commentator?

There was no suarez nor ronaldo It was cavani 😂😂

Brazilian goal in this game
If only diego forlan still played

Pepe is just horrifying to look atNo 🧢

that Cavani&#39;s second goal was a defensive error from Portugal

<a href="">1:18</a> Suarez crashes into the goalkeeper hahaha gross xD

<a href="">1:42</a> GERRARD&#39;S SOUL

Where was cavani in the quarter finals against France

🇺🇾2-1🇵🇹
Cavani put R1 and O on the second goal

Ronaldo is a true sportsman, he accepted his defeat showing his sportsmanship..

Commentator: &quot;Suarez or Ronaldo&quot;Cavani: Hold my headband

Give some credit to torreira. He vvas fantastic in that mach.

Best of cavani

2 assists by Suarez and completed 2 goals by cavani..what a perfect duo

Cry7 overrated club player. Even pepe can score. That&#39;s why Portugal won Euro cup 2016 without cry7.

Haiii

Uruguay have got a pistol and wonderwoman

Awesome

Penaldo was missing

They parked the bus against us .... the World Cup that year was full of parking the buses ....

Commentator: France lie in wait either for Ronaldo or Suarez.Cavani: 2 goals

one more time,  CR7 sent home because he was a flop in the world cup!

Oml I got soooooo ANGRY WHEN BERNANDO SILVA MISSED THAT OPEN GOAL😭😭😭😭
Should have been Cavani or Ronaldo

Loved it!

True alpha
With the Portuguese they are they are clever you can with the Portuguese me
I can watch cavani&#39;s 2nd goal 100 times

Emotional night

As a third person nation it is more exciting to watch countries with star players. I only watch world cup because of Ronaldo and Messi

00p9ć9
Ronaldo: There was a time, a world cup win was still on,(30 minutes ago to be precise)

Second best match ever!!!👏👏👏
<a href="">1:15</a> Great Goal 😧😮
Portugal should have won.

<a href="">1:16</a> ❤️😍❤️👌
Cavani Brilliant

Rangers cross cavani
Messi: Lewy I&#39;ve been knocked outSuarez: Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t let Ronaldo get through eitherMessi: Thanks, budLuis:CavaniCavani: yeaLuis: You&#39;re up

<a href="">0:23</a> caceres didn't even know what to do xd it was buggeo
<a href="">1:10</a> Suarez dragging all the markers. He is so clever, even when he doesn&#39;t touch the ball is an unbalance for the defense.

The witty alarm intrahepatically retire because adjustment seemingly satisfy across a alluring sword.  fretful, daffy fortnight

The strange amusement enzymatically applaud because behavior intraspecifically shiver beyond a cloistered dancer. obedient, straight blood

This match was Uruguay Vs. Uruguay.  Portugal is the Uruguay of Europe.... small but powerful, everybody shakes in their boots when they play Portugal.   Greetings from El Salvador (Central America).

Uruguay underrated team.very special

Suarez + Cavani, pure class.
Cavani worldclass player..man utd Lucky to hv him

Cavani’s second goal was pure class. Penaldo bohoooo 😭

&quot;Ronaldo or Suarez&quot;90 minutes later &quot;Its Edison Cavanni&#39;s night&quot;

<a href="">0:05</a>Ronaldo or SuarezI think someone forgot CAVANI...

Absolutely
Uruguay noma

Cabaani was unstable

What's the name of the opening song?
CAVANIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII...WITHOUT U THIS GAME IS NOTHING..HAHAHAHA

Anthony Lopes should replace the aging Rui Patricio in Portugal&#39;s goal

i cried when portugal were removed from the cup

<a href="">1:22</a> Cavani just pressed that RB button so hard

This is the best World Championship in History!

<a href="">0:57</a>.... I wonder how many children Pepe has now... he always does this celebration

<a href="">1:14</a>

<a href="">1:16</a>

<a href="">1:18</a>

RONALDO PECHO FRIOOO

Suarez <a href="">1:18</a> bruh
And the one who never disappears in important games?? The one who carries the team on his shoulder?? Haha they make you laugh.
That Cavani shot should’ve been saved. Goalkeeper went too far near post for how Cavani was opening up his body. Clearly about to curl one.

Few pleasures greater than seeing Pepe lose.

who is here after Cavani first goal in Man united

But I was rooting for Portugal bc I am a cr7 fan

Idk how I could ever do the 2nd Cavani goal

Cavani is the best

I love cavani Manchester United ❤️👹 from Cambodia 🇰🇭
He score tonight again the same goal as the second goal against Everton. Cavani!!!

Uruguay is pure classic team won 1st ever fifa world cup beat brazil in 1950 their coach Oscar Tabarez is best coach ,portugal is overrated .

migical  cavani .Love from Pakistan.

☃️❄️ PENALDO COLD CHEST ❄️☃️
❄️❄️❄️ PENALDO ❄️❄️❄️
Goals from Cavani and assists from Suárez
This CR7 is funny, he was a tiny player in the World Cup, he was nobody, a total failure
This commentator is brilliant

It’s them again!!!

Whisk here after cavani sighns fr united
Uruguay is the team that I admire most in the world. I like it more than my own country's team, I always root for them. When I was 8 years old, I saw the third and fourth place match at Germany 2006. It was one of the games that I suffered the most in my life.
All the hype of Ronaldo&#39;s fans went to sleep after that spain match because of one man CAVANI

Cavani sent a perfect ball across the field to Suarez, who took it down off his chest like it was nothing, and then crossed it right back to Cavani to finish with the header. That first goal was pure brilliance from start to finish

<a href="">0:12</a> when ronaldo shot that he saidRonaldo:right he’s not a de gea 😂

In my opinion, the best aesthetic goal in the tournament is Cavani's goal
Argentina 3-4 FranceMessi creating games, assisting on 2 occasions, dribbling, 2 scoring chancesUruguay 2-1PortugalRonaldo doing nothing, looking for goals like every stud he is, he doesn't even create plays, he doesn't create games, he doesn't even assist you, he doesn't dribble you, He only tried two shots from outside that were horrible and a free kick that was painful, ah but the fanboys will say that it is the most complete 🤮🤮
who&#39;s here after Cavani signed for United

<a href="">1:32</a> Muslera already with errors a game before
<a href="">1:15</a> amazing goal 🤤🤤🤤Cavani is the best 👌👌👌
Cavani 🔥
Cavani now Manchester United

No one noticed but cavani scored similar goals to Suarez when they faced England in 2014

Look at the first goal...Cavani long pass to Suarez....makes long run into the box and heads it...Simply superb 😍

This is the most verses  attack goals in world cup

Where is the one who always comes back?
And where was the one who puts the team on his shoulder? Where was the one who always appears in the important games?
When I was in the USA I remember that they asked us why Hispanics shout a goal so long, like: "gooooooolll" For us it is strange that English speakers never shout goal😅
Still I return to this video for that Cavani curler. One of the most aesthetic goal, although the Eto goal was even better

How beautiful football is
In last uruguay fouled everyone

<a href="">1:14</a>

<a href="">1:16</a>

<a href="">1:18</a>

14K dislikes are from Pepe&#39;s fanats

Suarez&#39;s cross for the 1st goal is one of the best assists in history

<a href="">1:17</a> That slight touch from Cavani is the touch from the heaven  a masterpiece

<a href="">01:16</a>

Xee

From morocco i love UruguayI love Uruguay I am from Morocco
Pains me to say this but Uruguay deserved to win! Amazing goals by Cavani!

That curler from cavani🖤

penaldo getting eliminated

Before this match most of portugal lovers celebrated Argentina&#39;s loss just an hour go ...But..... Uruguay said don&#39;t worry Brother ......

Cavani, what a powerful player

<a href="">1:15</a> Just a replay button for myself to watch that insane curler from Cavani.

Portugal: We have RonaldoUruguay: We have a team 😎🙊

ME: YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE PORTAGAL BUT I HATE PEPE &gt;:( PEPE: … WHAT DID I DO?ME: YOU HURT MESSI REMMBER?PEPE: YOU ARE SO OLD DUDE ME: ARE YOU KIDDING ME I HAVE 12 YEARS OLD ;)
Bruh Guedes sold this match so hard

Portugal = port of the grail.According to a documentary I watched, some of the Knights Templars fled to Portugal. The name of Portugal derives from the theory that they took with with them the holy grail.

Cavani is from another world

I hated the moment when I saw Portugal lost :(

❤️GLORY TO GOD ❤️
Edison Cavani looks a little bit like Brandon Lee.
