If there was an Oscar for best trailer ever made, this would win uncontested.

Don&#39;t wish to spoil anyone&#39;s mood with my personal life but if you ever had to take care of your mom you know this guy from bottom to top.

The film is actually good, but it&#39;s a shame, the actor playing Joker is too old, it&#39;s like watching a transvestite film

It seems like the life of someone who lives in São Paulo.
Looking back, this trailer was better than  the movie itself...  Sorry to say this...

the biggest trailer ever made
THIS is one of the best movie trailers ever made!! Yes the movie itself is very good, and with a phenomenal lead actor performance, but I don&#39;t say lightly that this trailer is truly gripping from start to finish, all the while elevating one&#39;s emotions until &quot;JOKER&quot; displays....ooo the feels!! Brilliant, simply brilliant💜

Been 4 years, huh ?

Watching this in the cinema Made me Feel Really sorry for the JokerOnly what he wanted was to bring joy to the worldAnd the world ignored him

Its not more relevant than ever before things were always like this.

Jokers are not laughing stock, they make everyone laugh, they live in people&#39;s hearts

100% understanding
this movie is a masterpiece, to the level of the first superman or even better.  This DC movie is way better than all marvel movies combined

<a href="">0:45</a> song..?
I love how Warner Bro&#39;s made the joker in this movie an actual comedian hence his name. They made his iconic laugh his expression of intense sadness rather wickedness (which was the villainous characters of the previous jokers). So brilliant.

It&#39;s been almost 5 years and it still touches me.

I’d love if they did a Lex Luthor origin movie. Such a movie would also be perfect and make total sense.

Still the best trailer ever made.

Even though I watched it dubbed, the movie still hit hard. Really just on ordinary clown having enough of middleman walking trough claiming everything is his

I&#39;ve been still thinking about this guys as I am waiting for the sequel this October 4th of 2024 what if a &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; existed in this realm? My gosh that would be &quot;Sick!&quot; 😱

Remember: Joker 2 hits cinemas October 4th 💯
I love this so much

When White People become too lenient....things break down.

A powerful moral of treating people with respect at all times.

5 years later... Joker 2 comes out this March 🙌

God, I want the 15 paying every penny for 10 years in pain and humiliation and then expiring. Amen!
Masterpiece trailer

Finally got to watch the movie. Loved every minute!

I still come to rewatch this trailer, one of the best ever.

Hindi dubbed please
Not dubbed
Not dubbed yet
Does That Music Sounds Like Munich By John Williams?

At the <a href="">1:41</a> part, you can clearly but faintly hear Godzilla&#39;s Showa roar as the trailer&#39;s background noise. Seems pretty obvious to me. 😮

4 years later and still a masterpiece. One of the greatest villain origin films of this generation.

A masterpiece: All we want to be is be ourselves

My life is exactly like the jokers but the mother story is different

Need in hindi language DC please

Need in hindi dubbed please warner bros

I lived a life like the Joker. But I don&#39;t agree with Joker&#39;s choice. I will face the Joker as well as his enemies. Remember. i am zigo.

This music can&#39;t get out of my head after 4 years .. damn

<a href="">1:01</a>

my favorite movie of all time

The BEST Joker makeup to exist

<a href="">2:13</a> Um guys are those sparks? 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😰😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥🤫🤫🤫
This movie is so good, same goes to The Batman, Hope Warner realizes that some of us like movies to be so serious like Snyder&#39;s Justice League.

My favourite movie ❤
Is this movie available in hindi

<a href="">1:05</a> that chuckle 👿

85M

Love the part where he shoots Deneiro

This guy is too good an actor. Flawless❤❤❤

This movie was absolutely amazing. Even 4 years later it’s definitely in my top 5 favorite films ever.

<a href="">2:20</a>

<b>Willem Dafoe</b> should’ve been the joker during the this time. As a set up for <b>Ben Affleck’s</b> own Batman movie 🍿😢

This movie was very telling. Like foreshadowing of what was to come. This was before COVID. Wearing masks, civi unrest, &quot;What kind of coward would do something that cold-blooded? Someone who hides behind a mask.&quot;

What is the name of that movie, if it is one, I have no idea

Hyped for the sequel ❤❤❤

Joker takes the comic book character and makes him into a sad yet interesting person, lead by Joaquin Phoenix’s outstanding performance, engaging all the way through, and a dark tone with it.

I know just enough about the Joker from The Dark Knight despite not seeing it, but an deeper look into his origin looks amazing and this trailer proves it.

Art imitating life. This trailer says so much about those who aren&#39;t often heard in society. The build up to him losing his mind will really make you think about how we handle folks with mental illness. If someone would have just given a damn and helped him maybe things wouldn&#39;t have gotten so bad for him.  This movie and this trailer really makes you think I honestly don&#39;t know how part 2 will out do this.

While I found the movie itself to be far too depressing, this is still, hands down, the greatest trailer ever made.

I dunnno.  I can&#39;t find this movie in ANY theatre.

i wish Joaquin make the second  part of this movie soon ❤

<a href="">1:24</a>

Now that is a masterpiece. Lost count, the number of times I watched this.

Oh Arthur it’s not just you the world has gotten crazier out there this movie was a masterpiece

What a perfect song for this.

Why aren&#39;t more trailers like this? Doesn&#39;t give away the whole plot. Shows powerful and beautiful scenes, its just perfect.

I do think this trailer is arguably better than the movie itself

<a href="">2:20</a>

I&#39;ve always loved this movie. I feel like we as a society are getting close to what happens in the film

<a href="">1:01</a>

It&#39;s 11/4/23, who&#39;s still watching this?

This is the best joker movie

It was an <a href="">#era</a>

still getting goosebumps, this trailer is just perfect

BEST TRAILER EVER, THE BEST MOVIE, THE BEST CHARACTER, THE BEST ACTOR...THE BEST OF DC

this joker movie is soo lame. the movie itself was a real joke. he was just a dumb insane criminal. he got depressed because he got hit with thin plywood board lol! joker is supposed to be super smart, unpredictable insane mastermind. this is just insanity + no mind whatsoever. just a normal criminal. if anything I&#39;ve faced more hardships than him for real😂😂

A wonderful and beautiful crime and psychological thriller film, with all thanks and sincere appreciation 👋🏼 to the Arab translators who translated all &quot; Beautiful, wonderful and very happy international foreign films, old and new &quot; Thanks to them, it spread throughout the Arab and Islamic world through their translation of this &quot; Beautiful, wonderful and very happy international foreign films, old and new &quot; The translation of the two professors was distinguished by: &quot; Islam Al-Jizawi and Omar Al-Shaqqi &quot; With its splendor and the translation of all the minute details found in &quot; Beautiful, wonderful and very happy international foreign films, old and new &quot; From: &quot; Music, paintings, plastic banners, text messages, local newspapers, and many, many more, translations of everything present in any wonderful, beautiful, and very happy foreign film.

stunning cinema
After 4 years and waiting for part 2
Amazing <b>how both this trailer and the actual movie are already one of Warner Bros’s BEST modern Masterpieces</b>

When I told my family I wanted to watch this movie, they all laughed at me. Well no one&#39;s laughing now...

yep, still coming back
best DC movie ever.
4 years and still watching the trailer - stunning 👏👌 🏆

One of the shitersr movies I’ve ever seen movie drags with no action for <a href="">1:39</a> minutes

My biggest mistake of 2019? <b>Never seeing this in theaters,</b> that’s what.

goated trailer, literally one of my favorite ever!

Great movie.

<a href="">1:24</a> <b>cries</b> its so beautiful

One of the rare movies that&#39;s pro male and not a movie that encourages male hatred or glorifies male sacrifice and stoicism.

4 years later &amp; still a masterpiece.

Going to watch this hope it’s as good as everyone said… I’ll be back !

I will always regret for not seeing this masterpiece in a theater

This and The Dark Knight are the best things Warner DC ever did

4 years later and I’m still going back to this trailer, and still feel the chills of what a masterful trailer and the movie is. DC might missed most of the time but when it hits, it’s a home run.

Incredible Warner Bros Pictures
Wonderfull Warner Bros Picture Brasil
Spectacular Joker.  Fantastic Coringa Teaser.

P

I absolutely loved this movie. It finally made DC movie’s entertaining to me. Real life isn’t always happy or funny. This showed the darker side to it all which made it extremely moving especially by tying mental illness into it. Cannot wait for the second one.

Sequel comes out 2024 can’t wait should be good for sure 😈😈

When I look back at this trailer as an adult I get chills man.

Revive of great art movies..Greatest tragedy explained beautiful concept.. Music Joaquin performance touches soul.. Each &amp; everyone has to search their own identity....Won Oscar Deserved oscar

<a href="">0:52</a> he look at her with such love in his eyes

This trailer and this film helped me cope in the months after my father’s death

This teaser is so good. Cant wait for the next movie. First was amazing

Arthur IT IS getting crazier out there

One of the few trailers that’s just as good as the movie.

Very amazing movie I like it ,it is masterpiece😙💛💛
Yeah this movie sucked.

Oh, well, there will certainly be whiners who are not at all interested in the quality of the work. These people like to talk about problems in society of unhappy people. I'll tell you naive. Every species has clear goals and objectives in its habitat. A laboratory chamber for experiments on mice is not their environment. Goals and objectives for people are dictated by society with its rules and laws. This is entirely the work of natural genetic mechanisms of evolution. You can continue to find out who offended whom, hmm, to the point of anarchy.
I still watched this film. However, Todd didn’t really want to make a film based on comic books - for him they were too “pretentious” and uninteresting. “Joker” collected 335.5 million dollars in the USA and Canada and 738 million in other countries, which is In the end, the total amount was $1.074 billion. The film became the sixth highest-grossing film of 2019 and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, as well as the first R-rated film to gross a billion. In terms of the film's budget of $55 million, the film was also the highest-grossing film based on a comic book. The most ridiculous film I have ever seen. Well, seriously, these fees are as absurd as civilized people today. I understand that by definition you can’t expect more from a comedy director. Of course, I am completely loyal to the actors. But the lack of sex in a film like this? These pop scenes were apparently filmed on a phone? By the end, in general, the picture slipped into some kind of music video, which causes bewilderment. What is it? I have the answer, but I'm too old for it. I also didn’t like that there was some senseless rubbish around, but that’s what it is, of course... But the really funny thing is that I’ve been listening to the whining of the elite for 5 years now 😆
Fantastic Coringa Teaser
Wonderfull Warner Bros Picture.

Can&#39;t wait for Joker 2

As a psycho who works as a ClownI see this as an absolute Masterpiece🤡

This trailer is still a masterpiece

guys i rlly need the song, whats its name?

The music is so good.

Good

Best trailer in the history of movies .

Epic trailer for a fantastic film. Phoenix deserved that oscar. Can&#39;t wait for Part II.

Considering the time we live in, we need such a Joker more than ever.

What’s amazing about this movie is how they portrayed Joker in a ultra realistic manner. It’s disturbing because you can actually watch this and say it’s very possible for a human being to turn out like this. It’s unlike your typical Joker movie where he is portrayed as an over-the-top psychopath comic book villain.

It&#39;s already been 4 years of this Cinematic Masterpiece trailer.

If joker was real he’d be a great best friend to be around

A ground breaking film in every regard.... however I can only see the next Joker film being a diminished version of this, particularly with Stefani Germanotta copying Joaquin Phoenix (because she was such a fanatic and wants to inhabit him for her own attention) the same thing she did when she was suppose to do a tribute to David Bowie at the brits, but made a complete mockery of it by making it about her 🙄. I can see this film being made around the Harley Quinn character and not the Joker and his other movie with Ridley Scott (Napoleon) being based around Vanessa Kirby&#39;s character rather than the actual movie. Such a shame that great directors, actors, editors and script writers have to allow this madness for the sake of the insane-woke agenda and woketards, this has already impeded on the quality and greatly impacts the integrity of the film.Thank goodness we would still have this one, untainted!

A villain born from a capitalist system

I don&#39;t watch old trailers, I watch old memories

<a href="">2:02</a> Mahler 9
This tailler is better than the movie.
You know a movie is awesome, when you came back to the trailer after watching it.

2019: Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?2020: Hold my beer!

So, this an official DC movie now? I didn&#39;t really care for this movie all that much. I thought it was good, not great. However, if one villain deserves a solo movie with an R rating, it&#39;s definitely the Joker

Best trailer ever and the movie is a masterpiece!!

This trailer alone deserves awards.Chills everytime

Both the trailer and the movie are a masterpiece

This trailer is a work of art in itself.
Dark gritty and perfect

I’m ngl this trailer is so much better than the actual movie. The movie itself…is okay and was basically so derivative of Scorsese I just couldn’t get into it. but I actually come back to this specific trailer over and over because it’s so epic

Arguably the best DC movie ever made, no super heroes, no magic, no powers, just a man who’s disenfranchised who’s trying to find his way living in a society that does not care for him or people like him.

It was this movie or I forgot the others that came out that same time but I told my people hey let&#39;s watch the joker. My pops was a joker fan but never really go into comics that much but I took him to see it and he loved it.

I love this movie

This movie made me feel sickened!

Charming yet deranged, that&#39;s the best description for the music. And possibly, for Joker

Back there to say we dont need a joker 2. This masterpiece is the only way.

I will never get over this trailer
&quot;I used to think my life was a tragedy......but now I realize, it&#39;s a comedy.&quot;

Masterpiece!!

Still a masterpiece.

No matter what anyone say. We love Arthur.

I am literally him

That happened to our friend Ricardo O&#39;Farrill.

To this day, there hasn&#39;t been a better trailer than this masterpiece. Long live Joker.

Masterpiece, a bless for humanity.

Still a masterpiece of a trailer 3 years later.

We all have felt the things what he feels in the movie at some point of time in life....  (🎬  Very close to my ❤)

its.... its been 4 years...

Best movie of the history of the world

Still watching it

4 years later and this trailer is still a masterpiece

The comments make it seem like this came out 10 years ago lol

Barbie movie gonna solo this
What name music ?

Thank you Todd for making the sequel possible i&#39;ve been waiting for this since 2019 🫡🤡 <a href="">#FreeJoker</a>

This trailer is timeless

<a href="">2:18</a> That is such a perfect shot.

Waiting for Joker 2

4 years anniversary

Bro the trailer was better and more tesne than the movie like wtf i know im nit the only onw who thought this 😂

what song is playing in the second half of the trailer and where can i find it?

This movie is a masterpiece it does not really need a sequel this deserves to be up there with godfather the cinematography and music is amazing I love this film.

Been almost 3 years still fresh

Anyone watching this trailer in 2023?

Joaquín won the Oscar from this trailer...
The best trailer ever made

The greatest trailer of any movie of all time

Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! I&#39;m scared of a sequel.  Maybe we should just let this one stand on its own??!!!🫣

the movie is very relatable

Trailer made me cry 😭

Its been 3 years, damn it&#39;s still makes me tear up everything

This trailer is better than any marvel  trailer that has been released in phase 4 and 5

He bows, not boughs, to precipitous people. This is an update of the match schizm.

Gypsy Crusader: the movie

Who&#39;s here after watching the Pipkin Pippa parody video?

There&#39;s a Young Bruce Wayne. Age 7.

so much nostalgia
Funny movie

No heroes, no villains, no action and no super powers, just Arthur Fleck. Please DC just do the same for the second movie.

perfection.

Best Teaser ever 💖

Such a shame they never did anything more with this Joker - it didn&#39;t need to tie in to any &#39;universe&#39; but damn they could have made a sequel where we see his perspective as Batman &#39;rises&#39;. Wasted opportunity.

everything is frickin&#39; perfect!!!

This is up there with some of the greatest trailers ever.

Nostalgia
The best part was this movie hit just before covid and the world literally went full clown world

This movie was so overrated. Just watch it again. I love mr Phoenix but he was the worst joker, he sounded like a cry baby.

I can&#39;t count how many times this trailer made me cry.

Idc how many people will hate the sequel I’m interested in how this plays out especially after the first film was just so intense

🤡🃏❤️ happy Valentine&#39;s Day Lady Gaga
This was a phenomenal movie trailer to movie everything was great

besides Joaquin&#39;s acting this movie is terrible

One of the greatest movies and performence&#39;s of all time,,Don&#39;t Smile&quot;

Great trailer, disappointing movie.
Still remember seeing this for the first time

Genial joker - genius movie... WOW
Very worried they’re gonna f*ck up Joker 2 and ruin the nostalgia of the first.

Trashe

WB DC Joker 🃏 Happy Halloween 🎃 On October 2019
This trailer is probably one of the bests ever, it so damn good, everything is perfect

This trailer alone kind of acts PG-13, while the movie itself is R to its core.

<a href="">2:04</a>This scene gives me goosebumps 🔥

Joker movie is literally a chris chan movie 😂

A

Maybe the real Joker were the friends we made along the way. -Arthur Fleck

A masterpiece

i&#39;m always rewatching this trailer.

Best trailer of all time IMO. The “I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it&#39;s a comedy” with the soundtrack is legendary.

This is right up there with the inception trailer

People complaining about the atrocities, madness, and outrageous stuff displayed in the movie is unbearable. Joker is a chaotic person who wishes chaos, everything they said was exactly supposed to be in the movie . This was a masterpiece.

Joker is one of the most powerful, well made comic book movies of all time, Todd Philip’s created a masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix nailed the role of Joker 👏👏👏

Still to this day, the trailer gives me chills especially at <a href="">1:25</a>

Oscar worthy trailer

I remember watching the teaser in the theatres for the first time. It was so damn magical.

Song anybody? It sounds like the continental by Ginger Rogers.

When you see the look on his face that means he angry 😡 <a href="">1:13</a> <a href="">1:24</a> <a href="">1:34</a>

Joaquin phoenix is a great actor for the joker 🃏 <a href="">0:54</a>

<a href="">2:04</a> to the end is so damn memorable. The music makes it so damn perfect

TAXI DRIVER &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; joker
End of 2022 and this is still by far the best trailer ive ever seen tantamount to the movie itself.

I have never seen nor been interested in seeing a marvel movie. I loved comics when I was a kid but as an adult I always felt like &#39;comic book and superhero movies are for kids&#39;. This is the first Marvel trailer that has ever made me want to rethink that. It took me 3+ years just to see the trailer for the first time. That&#39;s how little I have paid attention to that stuff up until now.

Best movie ever
I will never get over this trailer, I always watch it!
These terorists: Samsonovi, lukini, sivkobi, kuznetsovi, ahmetovi, ahmatnurovi, zenkovi, shainurovi, tikhomirovi, petini, salnikovi, nikitini , mitini  from Perm.  Their terrorists group organized terracts Trade Center 2011, Tsunami 2004, MS Estonia 1994, terakts in metro of Moscow, fire in hromaya loshad cafe in Perm, corona virus in 2019.

Waiting for Joker: Folie à Deux
Yo, i already watched the movie a ton of times but I still come back to this teaser for some reason

such an important character reflecting of the path our current society is heading towards. 10/10

Pretty sick movie just like the people in this country. Pretty Sick.

ISAIAH 12:4-5 (NASB)And on that day you will say, &quot;Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name. Make known His deeds among the peoples; make them remember that His name is exalted.&quot; Praise the LORD in song, for He has done glorious things; let this be known throughout the earth.

Seen this movie before and bro, it was JOKERIFIC

the trailer alone deserves an oscar

Goosebumps... even 3 years later

Real definition of bullies don&#39;t always win. Shout-out to the underdogs and the hurt people.

Only villian with no haters🔥🔥

Smile enjoy your stay in your home universe it ain&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s yours

My favorite movie of all time.

He walks next to the fire exit, brilliant. Awesome. Amazing. Incredible. Best Director.  Best Screenplay. Best.

<a href="">2:14</a> Warner Bros presents a movie of Batman&#39;s main enemy: JOKER

This movie&#39;s plot is basically &#39;what if Charlie Chaplin had a gun&#39;

If you just listen to the sound and don’t watch the video and don’t understand english, this trailer would sound like a romantic movie

I watched this film few times but I wanted to back to watch this trailer again and still I think it&#39;s a masterpiece.

watching this movie was a waste of time

Any Man DONT had DOCTORS in G🌞D🌫️ 🌅NaturAL🌄 🌪️🏞️makS ###
That face ... just kindness. When his doctor ask him.

I just watched this trailer again in 2022 and I was vaulted back into time. The music once again gave me chills. The cinematics made my jaw drop again. ...and the story is still exactly how mine could have been written.

this movie was a master peace

Glad he&#39;s back as J

One of the BEST MOVIES EVER!!

Chills watching the trailer even after watching the whole movie a number of times 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓

Ohh yea, this happened to my buddy Eric once

<a href="">0:42</a> Not really you see what doesn&#39;t kill you makes you...............stranger!!!!!!!!!

One of the greatest movies of all times I went to the movies about eight times to see this film

This trailer make me tear

We truly do live in a society…

Todd making movies great again

They should have an Oscar category for trailers. I keep coming back to watch this...just to marvel at how good it is.

The trailer was straight up fire!

The trailer is awesome

This movie is joker’s official backstory, I don’t care what anyone says.

Two franchise making their villiansOne made a Alien then gave it all of the power in the universe The other Made a ill man then took everything from him.

October 4 should be JOKER day🤡

Pure masterpiece ✨️
Yeh, the bad guys on the subway were drunk business men. Hollywood stinks.

The best DC film since The Dark Knight

This trailer is such a work of art

This trailer is phenomenal!!! It’s insane that the movie is better than this movie trailer!!!😂

the joker in this movie is the type of villain that you would feel empathetic for

Arthur Fleck is the type of person I would be great friends with just because of how kind he and how he’s always trying to make people laugh. Maybe not when he’s stabbing people or shooting them in the face

The last great movie before COVID swept everything

I can&#39;t wait for the sequel coming in 2024!😁

This movie is the exact representation of an average man.

When they called him a freak it made me tear up because I can relate to the Joker&#39;s pain as people looked at me that way growing up and made me feel like one

Though I have my issues with this film, as a Joker movie, god… damn, this trailer is just exhilarating! Easily one of the best I have seen and, no matter how I may feel about the film now, I will never forget how excited I was when this trailer first came out 😁

Masterpiece

This is the down to Earth relatable film of the modern era.In early/mid 2000s it was Napolean Dynomite and Juno, in the 1980s it was The Breakfast Club, and today, it&#39;s Joker.

Is it just me or do I keep coming to this trailer

After long period i saw the trailer and it has same potential as before

Better than any trashy marvel movie.

A musical sequel, titled Joker: Folie à Deux (transl. &quot;Madness for Two&quot;), is scheduled to be released on October 4, 2024, with Phillips and Phoenix returning.

Batman is the hero Gotham needed. Joker is the hero Gotham deserved.

The movie itself was ok..  didn&#39;t have the emotional pull of great films.  This trailer is excellent though

Dont remember how many times I had watched this. How many times you watch, you will never get tired of this.

If Warner Bros makes more movies like this, we’d have so many damn masterpieces

Masterpiece...

First time I saw this, it was a preview in the movie theatre. I immediately got goose bumps, and had a feeling this could be a Oscar winner.

This trailer was so good

10.04.24 😁
3 years later and I&#39;m still watching this trailer

Do you guys know the song on the end of the video trailer?

One of the greatest trailer ever made in film industry

This is getting a part 2?!

Well, I am here because this masterpiece is getting a second movie. See you guys in 2024.

Can&#39;t wait to see what they do with part 2

<a href="">2:04</a> chills

The movie was good. But, please forgive me. This trailer alone was just a masterpiece.

He came back, but he won&#39;t be alone 10.04.24

I come just to remember how epic this trailer was... ❤
🦇 Seriously WB, Please consider releasing Batgirl 🦇
Some of us really want to see it!

To me this is by far the best trailer ever made

<a href="">2:03</a> me going to see barbie
I wanted to like this but it was sooo boring I couldn&#39;t finish

Still the best

I want part two this movie and also very pot too the actor i love Joaquin Phoenix.

Three years later. It did get crazier out there

Still watching the trailer untill now 2022

<a href="">1:35</a> This tells Me that this whole thing was real and that Thomas Wayne really was as awful as they showed him to be

I always come back to this video whenever I feel sad, anger, or joy. This teaser trailer are so different than the others. I don&#39;t know why but it&#39;s like my big mood or something.

<a href="">1:21</a> THAT MELODY

Cinema AF.
<a href="">1:30</a> when this trailer dropped i thought the joker was in the interrogation room by himself and he was dancing in there like a savage for the people to see on the other side of the glass

I know that this is called acting but.. the way he looked at her <a href="">0:53</a> .. is just wow 😭💕

Every time I'm sad, I think about replaying the Joker trailer 🤡😌
ㄔ……well good video : )
This movie becomes my addiction

<a href="">1:50</a> I wish he said the line like this in the movie it’s so much better

I have watched this movie 10 times already but I&#39;m still here in 2022 watching the trailer again 🤦

Waiting second part

bruh this is like the best trailer ever

This still gives me goosebumps, one of the best cinematic trailers I&#39;ve ever seen!

All it takes is one bad day...- The Joker

I mean….this trailer did had a musical vibe to it.

Nostalgia
I just want to say this the sort of film you could say good to the degree of painful. That&#39;s how affective Jauqain Phonex is an actor.

I came back because they announced Joker 2.

Who else came when entering that there will be Joker 2?
Y’all there is a sequel coming out it was just announced !

Joachin Phoenix extraordinary performance!!!
Watching this marvellous trailer in these mad times of 2022.

Came here after a gap of 2 years and it still gave goosebumps.

Joker 2 announced baby!

who came here after hearing about the sequel?, like if you did.

You will never understand the damage you did to someone,

Until the same thing is done to you.

- joker💯
I miss heath ledger to be honest ☹️

after almost 3 years man.. THE SEQUEL IS COMING

I&#39;m excited for the sequel

the sequel could be the best thing we have ever seen or the worst

A Joaquin Phoenix “JOKER” sequel is officially in the works &amp; director Todd Phillips has revealed the title for the sequel will be “JOKER”: Folie à Deux. (Madness For Two)♦️🌹Who’s here after the Announcement today by Todd Phillips 😱🔥

Yes.. We all know that if there hadn&#39;t been a better idea than the first, there wouldn&#39;t be a second, which exists, because Joker II is on its way, and now we can only wait for this masterpiece.

here we go again, joker 2

JOKER 2 YAS

JOKER 2 IS HAPPENING! 🃏🃏

LETS GO

Folie à Deux
JOKER 2 LETS GOOOOOOOOO

I still get chills watching this trailer. It’s so amazing. I don’t care what people say DC is better than marvel

Hats off to Joaquin Phoenix for his masterful acting!

This movie and The Batman are truly realistic and because of that incredible

This trailer made me understand what art is. Coming back to this trailer over and over and getting really emotionally.

This trailer deserves a oscar

This movie will forever be my favorite it’s an absolute masterpiece

Litterally me

Who agrees life was good when this film came out?

If you weren&#39;t there when this dropped, then you can&#39;t understand

Here after a White Nationalist Terrorist shot and killed 10 black people in Buffalo, New York. Nobody has learned the lessons put forward by this film and society is continuing to produce &quot;Jokers&quot;.

this is the best i litterally watched it 4 times

Goosebumps 🔥🔥 music ❤️
I wish this was connected to &#39;The Batman&#39;. This Joker would&#39;ve matched perfectly with The Riddler. Both villains that you can understand and agree in some areas.

I especially loved the trailer, Joaquín Phoenix, good performance
There’s no way its already been 3 years.

THE BATMAN &amp; THE JOKER

3 years.... This trailer changed me bruh. What a time. I had never been so hyped.

Both Batman and Joker really gone thur their past like how heroes and villains get trama by childhood and what they become really Batman and Joker really gone thur sad and true life

This movie is the goat

Dark, depressing, minimal or no humor..  DC should be. That&#39;s why we fans love DC.❤

“the child who is not openly welcomed by the village will burn it down to feel it’s warmth”

True crime fans: watch this. It’s a pretty accurate portrayal of the making of a serial killer tbh.

<a href="">1:14</a>

I&#39;m glad he won an Oscar for the joker great job.

spoiler: bro if only at the end of the new batman movie the joker in arkham was joaquin phoenix damn

There's a reason I got goosebumps every time I saw the best trailer in the history of cinema.

The trailer for this movie is so good.

The last time that a trailer actually got me completely hyped for a media product. Gives me goosebumps still.

Few movies had this much impact in real world.

Just thought about this, the batman and the joker are both just movies that take place in the DC universe. They don’t connect to other movies. But what if they did? I know it would work, but omg would I love to see this joker and the batman on screen.

Best actor

I watchwd it way over rated it hadd good scenary sometimes and graphics the pictures were lightly above average but it was runnis i compared it to the butterfly affect this or thats iyd say watch butterfly affect over this which is rubbish too

Why does 2019 feel like it was just yesterday

this masterpiece now the batman, I&#39;m glad DC is working on quality more than quantity

<a href="">1:50</a> 🃏

How about another sequel WB?

3 years...

Probably the only movie trailer with 84 million views after , way after the movie has been released

Can’t believe this trailer is 3 years old today

Legendary Trailer

This trailer is so awesome.

<b>How about another joke, Murray?</b>

Waiting Joker 2)
The hype was insane. And it really was a great theater experience

I need a Joker 2

All I have are negative thots.

Is he The Xokas?

This 2 trailers is very masterpiece

&quot;To them, you&#39;re just a freak... like me!&quot;

The gotham&#39;s atmosphere here so related to The Batman (2022)

This movie is a masterpiece

Still watching it. Phoenix nailed it. 🃏

My best actor: joaquin phoenix    My best film: joker
Why so serious🤡.

Just watching this brings back so many memories. This was such a good movieAnyone here 2022

Masterpiece

In 2015&#39;s Batman #38, the Joker reveals himself as immortal , having been exposed to Electrum, an alien chemical that was also in the meteorite that gave Vandal Savage his immortality , and fuels the Lazarus Pits that keep Ra&#39;s Al Ghul young

<a href="">0:05</a> The Joker 🤡🃏 Heath Ledger From Bat-Man The Dark Knight (2008) Story Movie.

<a href="">0:05</a> (Heath Ledger Hairstyles).
I still come back to this trailer every once in a while because it&#39;s so good.

As I remember the Simpsons meme with Jared Leto's Joker tied to the train seat telling everyone "But you only saw it for 2 minutes and 24 seconds" and they respond like &quot;And we love him. Never come back" ha ha ha
What kind of coward would do something that coldblooded someone who hides behind a mask

This is a very mean, cruel and nasty place.

great film

Superb Story ☺️ Lovely Work 👍
who came back after seeing pattinson&#39;s psycho batman?

<a href="">1:24</a>

Watching this again after The Batman... I really wish this was the Joker we got in The Batman&#39;s universe

This until now is one of the most fantastic trailers I ever saw. The movie is great, but couldnt forfill, what I felt watching this right here.

Just saw this movie for this first time yesterday and I really don’t understand why I didn’t see it 2 years earlier it was so good

such a classic to this day

this movie was a cultural reset

I remember watching this movie alone in a Theater full of strangers and it just turned out to be one of the best moments of my life. A masterpiece through and through. I was so stunned.

What a masterpiece it was !

Better and more compelling than the full length trailer. Excellence.

Best movie of the decade, century, all time ❤️ p.s the best movie trailer ever !!

Thing really did go crazy after this film was released. 🤡

2022 is my Joker era 😎
the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, without a doubt a great reflection

Gossebumps greatest mind biography ❤️
Still the best movie trailer I&#39;ve ever seen. So artistic and passionate.

This and godzilla hands down the best trailers ever made!!!!!

I love this movie. Thank you for bringing this pov to life

So much heart poured into this film! What a treat!

Best trailer of all time

This movie reminds me to just smile. I&#39;m in a very difficult time in my life life and my therapist tells me to just smile and be happy. I&#39;m on a path of suicide, I really am. And I sometimes wonder, If I smile and try to be happy, will things be better? This trailer alone just reminds me of the shell of my former self I truly am.

You either die good or you live long enough to become evil😨😨😨😨😨😨

i can&#39;t lie, whenever DC make a stand alone movie ( Dark Knight, Joker) and now the new batman. the trailers, music, cast and the movies are out of this world

Why does the title say now playing in theaters when it&#39;s a trailer for a movie that probably came out a couple of months before the film came out?

Is it just me...or is it getting crazier out there?

Probably the most realistic joker

<a href="">1:21</a> the music is so good

The thing is, the scene where author was smiling at the clown mask guy, it seemed so hypnotic, it made me smile with him, it made me laugh

Revisit this trailer after almost 3 years later and it&#39;s still one of the greatest movie trailers ever made. The music is so grande and classic!

I can&#39;t believe WB did survive during the era of Endgame

Simply Brilliant. Powerful

MASTERPIECE!!!

Man good times

This movie is masterpiece before the pandemic

What I love is the irony of that quote “what kind of coward would do something so cold blooded.? Someone who hides behind a mask” Batman doesn’t exist yet but when he does, he will be someone behind a mask but not doing cold blooded things. So not necessarily does someone who hides behind a mask mean they are cold blooded. Idk….I hope k explained that right 😅

Two years really fly by. I remember watching this trailer over and over again building up my excitement. This was a brilliant film. Joaquin Phoenix is just magnificent, he definitely deserved that Oscar. The score is also amazing. One of the best films I have ever seen.

We’re all clowns
Lol MCU still hasn’t received a major Oscar win

This is the perfect introduction for the beginning of a villain………

This movie was so good. I was expecting like some fierce battles but this was telling me he story of a man who had everything stripped form him and his revenge in return....

Active comment sections? Impressive.

Masterpiece
He watched crazy frog to many times

This Movie was the worst version of JOKER.
I miss 2019 🥺😞😔
They copied fazbear 2022 teaser trailer music 😡😡😡

I wish i could have watched it in the theatre

&quot;she told me I had a purpose, to bring joy and laughter to the world&quot;You sure do to us.

i hate when they show something in the trailer thats not in the movie. i waited for the scene where he is exaggerating rolling down the steps at <a href="">1:35</a>  but its no where to be found in the movie

EL JOKER

I wish the music was on Apple Music so I could listen to it all the time

HAHAHAHAHA 2 years have passed, and I still consider this the best trailer I've ever seen XD
2 days later someone ruined my life

For the very first time the trailer &amp; movie are both good.

This is the reality of our society... This movie really  tragic but real, gruesome but thrilling.. this is the society, where we live...

May he have a sequal !

<b><a href="">0:05</a></b><b> You can see his anguished expression inside, but he smiles gently to try to hide it. It&#39;s sad.</b>

Truely a masterpiece ✨👏👌🙌😍
My favorite movie 🎥😍❤💛💕
Although people fight over who did it better we can all agree… MARK HAMILL HAD THE BEST ANIMATED JOKER BY FAR

Still the best trailer of all time..

Villain who made up by Batman Villain who as more fans Villain who as a movie Villain who deserves as oscarBut the name of villain is 🃏𝗝𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗿

the last movie I saw before COVID, feels like a lifetime ago

Anyone still back here for this teaser in nov 2021

I used to think my life was a cringe compliation, but now I realize...it&#39;s a try not to laugh challenge

This looks so stupid.

0/10 worst movie ever, he didnt have Broken written on his forehead, tsk tsk tsk

This is the kind of trailer you keep coming back to, because of how good it is.

2 years and this trailer still amazing.

Can’t believe it’s already been 2 years. Absolute masterpiece

MAGNIFICENT

Overrated movie and performance from phoenix.

What a beautiful trailer, when I see it it makes me remember those days where everyone was happy ignoring what was coming
It&#39;s hard to watch him as Johnny Cash and then watch him as The Joker. He&#39;s an amazing method actor!

watching this every time i see SHIB moons and all other altcoins with plenty of world changing usecases dumps

Most emotional trailer:of the centyre

<b>And the Oscar goes too… Joaquin Phoenix Joker</b><b>Arthur: You Get What You F-cking Deserve!</b>

2 years later and it&#39;s STILL Playing in Theaters.

1.25 starting bgm name...

aah.. this is how trailers are supposed to be made..een this trailer deserves oscar

This trailer is truly incomparable✨

I miss being excited for this

Anyone in 2023???
Its 2021 and....I STILL LOVE THIS MOVIE

2 years now when I came back to this trailer, it still gives me goosebumps

Masterpiece 😪
Still My most favorite best character of all times I love this movie and Joaquin Phoenix as well 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

<a href="">0:10</a> GTA 6 Looks amazing!

best trailer ever still to this day

What a masterpiece

We’re living in the peak DC era right now. Joker and The Batman

Best trailer

Damn it’s been 2 years already

Is the title in the JOKER trailer the same as the BATMAN?
It's been more than two years since I saw this trailer, I still remember the emotions I felt when I saw it for the first time.
This movie is both upsetting and realistic

It&#39;s not a thriller movie is just a sad movie.. So many emotions in one man... He is unbelievable actor... This hero brings so much pain.... It&#39;s just a sad story.... He was such a good man and they made him a monster... That&#39;s Is my way to see him...

Phoenix killed this performance!!!! 👏 for this GREAT,EXCEPTIONAL ACTOR!

Health ledger would be so proud of this man

Still coming back for the trailer

I&#39;ve never watched both suicide squad and the dark knight trilogy. I just watch this. And I just really love this.

The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t

I just came back to say that this film is perfect
incel moment
Overrated movie of all time

Never was Joaquin Phoenix any better than in “JOKER”.   The actor has such tremendous screen presence that he seamlessly morphes into the “Arthur/Joker”* character, making  him seem as real as can be.   The  performance of a lifetime probably.   Hats off‼️.   ❤️🎩❤️* Through the motion picture, we basically learn why Arthur became Joker.   On the one hand, good Arthur had nothing left to lose.  On the other hand, evil Joker had everything to gain.

When you realize it’s the 3 year anniversary since Joker released in theaters!I used to think that my life was a tragedy, now I realize it’s a comedy 🤡2 more years to go 🃏🤡

This trailer is perhaps the best I&#39;ve ever seen.... it sets the mood perfectly

<a href="">2:03</a>

The devil in I by slipknot is the perfect song for this film... trulywell at least the first few words ....&quot;undo these chains&quot;...sort of meaning of u let me show u my real emotions as oppose to putting on a face of normalcy u&#39;ll see all the bottled of anger due to him being disregarded by society and ridiculed.....So when u hear &quot;undo these chains and ill so u my rage&quot;....its basically &quot;let me show u what society has made me&quot;....my anger had ben built up from yrs of being ignored(disregarded) and ridiculed and taken for granted

I will never forget how amazing this movie was and still is

Joaquin Phoenix with Joker becomes unattainable
Gypsy crusader the movie

Best teaser trailer in film history.

Goosebumps even after I’ve seen it 4 times.

I repeat this movie 100 time and still Wouldn&#39;t get it

at <a href="">1:35</a> is it really in the movie?

looking back at the trailers it really makes me miss 2019 and the hype for the movie when seeing this trailer

This movie also show mens emotions

Joe many liberals does it take to change a log by bolb????? None, their too busy???? Their gender😂😂😂😂😂😂

<a href="">0:22</a>, that&#39;s why Loki and Joker are so relatable.

I come back to this place when i&#39;m having a bad time just to recall the good times, 2019 was such a good year to me

Great movie his own suffering an the transformation his own body goes through..more than an Oscar

now that&#39;s a trailer alright!

I almost forgot to watch it today

Probably the greatest trailer ever made lol

the instrumental is sooooo GOOOOOD

Swejtube for Susan whoajewski sux

This trailer itself confirmed a Oscar for Joaquin!. Only person could have played this role better would have been Mr Charlie Chaplin himself!!

I’m scared to see the condiment king in this universe

Probably like 20 grand budget movie. Never seen a worse movie than this ever

<a href="">1:35</a> I don&#39;t remember this scene, did they remove it from the movie??

We alwers keep arver smile 🙂🙂🙂🙂
who is here after watching cruella?

You know a trailer slaps hard when 2 years later, it has over a million likes and an active comment section

simply divine x

Is it weird that I’ve seen this movie more than 3 times but I still come watch the trailer lol because it’s so good

best trailer ever
Who&#39;s here in 2021 and 2022 still enjoying this trailer?

Please... Do NOT make a sequel. Here we have one of the best movies ever made in the history of cinema. This movie WROTE history actually in cinema. Do not ruin it. No need to see nothing else. Make 1000 films about joker in the DC film universe. But dont destroy this.                            A movie lover.

This is so much better than the actual movie lmfao

after watching the movie 1000000000000000000000000 times I had watched the trailer 2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times

Perfection absolute perfection of a movie

Best trailer I’ve ever seen
We live in a society

Payasiel

Here to revisit a MASTERPIECE.

Amazing movie 👏👏👏
I have this movie.. And i still come back for this master piece

The last great thing we all witnessed together as people just before everything went to s**t. I can&#39;t stop thinking about that.

Two years later and I&#39;m still re watching this beautiful trailer. Always makes me smile :)

I have not overcome it yet
This might be the best teaser trailer in cinema history.

If only Movie trailers got Oscars Joker would of received one.

Going back to watch this trailer again makes it feel like I&#39;m watching it for the first time again

I like the fact that they named it &quot;joker&quot; and not &quot;the joker&quot;, Nice touch 😁

I finally watched this recently and honestly think this would work as canon in Batman lore

Did anyone ever find out the song at <a href="">1:27</a>?

The best joker Joaquan Phoenix ❤️

Finally ! A decent contemporary movie

This movie, wow, I&#39;m still stunned by it watching the trailer.  I remember watching at an employee screening at WB, I had no words.  A co-worker had seen it a few days before and wouldn&#39;t say a word about it.  I know now why she didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s quite possibly one of the most moving, emotional, sad films ever made.  And I mean that in the most brilliant of terms.

I think that this is one of the best outfits the joker has ever had including the hair and makeup.

I remember seeing this two years ago as an ad. I never watch ads but this trailer was so intriguing and so well made that I had to watch the whole thing.I remember thinking that this was the best trailer I ever seen. I haven’t gotten a chance to watch the movie yet but today is finally the day! Two years later! 😁😁

This movie is objectively a masterpiece

They should make a bunch of joker movies each with a different backstory for the joker and each one talking about how it’s the first movie from the jokers perspective because of what the joker says about not knowing his own past

Name: JokerRole: VillainHaters: 0Lovers:👇
Heath Ledger would have been proud.

Joke is on ppl who don’t take mental illness seriously. What a movie.

What&#39;s the movie name

I wish I could rewatch this trailer again

We live in a society.

so saddddddd

This trailer is so well put together. Amazing music and editing.

there should be a movie in which Margot Robbie play a role of Harley Quinn WITH Joaquin Pheonix as JOKER.... do something warner bos.

What’s the matter you ugly little child, don’t we make tou laugh? We are clowns, we are funny!

This trailer gets me so hype the music and the dancing Phoenix does fits.so.well

Nostalgic. I remember being obsessed with this movie, and the great soundtrack.

Joaquin Phoenix called perfecting the Joker&#39;s laugh the toughest part of playing the character.Joaquin Phoenix named Tim Curry&#39;s performance in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) as one of his inspirations for his performance in this film.The second DC movie featuring the Joker to be R-rated after Batman: The Killing Joke (2016).The film is Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s fourth Oscar nomination for acting (and his first-ever win).The first film based on a comic book to win the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.This film is the first theatrical live-action Batman spin-off since Suicide Squad (2016).Sharon Washington&#39;s character is named Debra Kane as a tribute to Batman&#39;s co-creator Bob Kane.The film was the second R-rated comic book film released in 2019. The first 2019 comic book film released is Hellboy (2019).The first R-rated movie in history to make $1 billion worldwide.Costing $55 million, this is the least expensive film to gross over $1 billion.

an underrated piece of art

Finally decided to watch this. I wished I watched it in the cinema. Wished they made more movies like this.

I think there should be a movie about the origins of Penguin in the same dark tone, it can be sick af.

I love how the cartoon joker’s calling card was a joker card and this joker has his calling card, so to say, is his medical card. At least to me that’s what it seemed like 🤷🏻‍♂️ great frickin movie

Props for the creator of the Joker &#39;19 Trailers. MASTERPIECE

<a href="">1:21</a> I don’t remember this laugh in the movie

Wtf i could not search for this video so i had to click a link for it

Really good show

masterpiece

Just finished this movie and wow... I don&#39;t know if I should be impressed or terrified. Joaquin, really sold the idea of what it is like to be a psycho path. Excellent performance. I still really love Heath&#39;s Joker better, however this one is definitely up there. I wonder how Joaquin&#39;s mental health is after this film. The state of mind you have to get to be able to do this must be super dark.

Grace
Joker acting crazy level
This trailer is definitely better than the final one.

Woke garbage 🗑
I wish i had that laugh

It is a good movie. But it feel like another franchise wearing joker skin. It is hollow.

Whew..... tough movievnot my cup of tea. But I did talk to him through a collaboration

Sweet as sugar...hard as ice Hurt me once I will kill you twice - JOKER

Who&#39;s still watching this trailer?

tought it was gonna be scary, no imma cry

There were a few shots here I don’t recall being in the movie.

I remember watching this in theaters and the audience were applauding and cheering when DeNiro got shot in the face.Funny!

Insanely good.

I like that they probably took inspiration from Taxi Driver.I like that.

I just keep coming back for this version of smile

When you realize that DC only had to be DC and not seek to be Marvel, every epic movie they had, the Joker was part of them, more darkness than light 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
One of the few trailers where the movie delivered. Better than anything in the MCU/DCU

This movie proved the point the killing joke did in such a wonderful way. One bad day can drive a man to insanity

this trailer is really big mood

It is impossible to put into words what an overrated rip off of a movie this is

The movie was OK but this trailer is beautiful... can&#39;t think of a more apt term.

Great movie
This movie is definitely better than any marvel movie ever made.

Gonna rewatch this movie today , omg 😭 one of the few dark &amp; realistic comic book movies ❤️ Joaquin nailed it

<a href="">2:04</a> goosebumps.

<a href="">#WEWANTINTAMILDUBBING</a> THIS MOVIE WE WANT TO WATCH THIS ON MY MOTHER TONGUE தமிழ்
No one going to comment on the beauty that is the music? So fitting. This movie was beyond amazing.

Joker will always be the most ICONIC comic book villain of all time

When I first saw this trailer&#39;s title, I thought to myself, &quot;*sigh* it&#39;s more of DC&#39;s bs...&quot; I was 100% wrong, what came out was a f**king masterpiece

Arguably, the greatest teaser trailer of ALL TIME!..💁🏻‍♂️

<a href="">1:03</a> In reality my uncle is joyful watching a chinese costume drama

This is still one of the best trailers ever made.

A movie about a true gamer

Botw Fans when they don&#39;t get news of BOTW2 for .1 seconds after getting botw2 news

man this soundtrack is amazing

Man, that grouch parody ruined this trailer for me 😂

Why should I apologize for the monster I have become? No one apologized for making me this way -Joker

Chaplin

if there&#39;s an award for &quot;best trailer&quot;, joker would easily win

The stage of acting to be really good is actually we are all jokers.

THIS MOIVE IS A MATERPIECE

Joaquin​ phoenix​ is​ the​ best​ of​ joker🤡🤡
This trailer makes me feel happy in an odd sort of way🤡🤡🤡

So many scenes skipped in final movie :((

I want watch in theater🍿.. Lonely... Who al with me

Me entering high school: <a href="">0:52</a>Me graduating: <a href="">2:05</a>

The Batman is the hero Gotham needs.The Joker is the villain this Gotham deserves.

This amazing movie should definitely be in the 90s on Rotten Tomatoes.

Mmmm parasite you won the oscar.....but where are you now......while Joker shines forever....

Don&#39;t forgen Happy face must be allwas

Many years later. This trailer still gives me chills

I literally 13 times seen this trailer🙃🙃🙃

<a href="">1:43</a> hahahaha, it says PUT0N there
Best trailer ever!
Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) are a same universe?

came back for the chills

The best
Joker is literally the story of a white male living in America

This movie would be even better if it was heath ledger

The Joker did great acting as Joaquin Phoenix.

This movie was ok taxi driver was better

Not gonna lie. This movie was pretty predictable. Still good though.

&quot;But now I realize. It&#39;s a comedy.&quot;More like horror.

still a damn masterpiece

Joaquin is too good for the oscars

Good but flawed movie, but damn if this isn&#39;t still one of the best edited teasers of all time, then I&#39;m Prince Philip

Bravo editors....
Who else comes back once in a while to enjoy this masterpiece of a trailer?

r.i.p dc
What a brilliant masterpiece! Bravo Mr. Phoenix, Mr. Phillips, Mrs. Guðnadóttir &amp; everyone else involved. Bellisimo! 👏
Idc what you say this trailer is still amazing

I miss this

I was way tied up with frozen at the time.  Snuck in to see three minutes of this and knew I should watch

bruh half of the clips in the trailer didnt even show in the movie :(((its still a beautiful movie tho dont get me wrong

The most overhyped, depressing, superficial crucible of cliches i&#39;ve ever seen. So bad that even a most gifted actor as Phoenix couldn&#39;t make anything worth of it. A terrible disappointment, that was Joker.

Said by s

Ace is robbed turns joker thanks 😊

<a href="">2:11</a> unused footage

Oh, Kenai.What did you do this time 😂😂😂

After 16 years of Brother Bear (2003) not being what should have been his most ICONIC role because of Disney, THIS arrives.

One of those rare movies where the trailer is just as well edited.

Best Trailer Ever!
Please dubbed in hindi

Wow!! I like how the trailers use of ‘’the stairs’’ kind of showed how his life unfolded. Started out as a tough climb trying to blend in with society but as the trailer progressed, the walk down seemed more natural and easy as portrayed by his natural movement or ‘’dancing’’. not really a fan of super hero films and comic characters but I just might download this on piratebay or something.

&quot;THIS FALL&quot;Not just referring to when the movie would come out, but what would literally happen to the character. Brilliant

This movie is the magic DC is capable of when they are not trying to ape the MCU.

This movie describes the life of so much of us right?!

Can we do this again. Joker 2?

I’m a Marvel fan before a DC fan but I like the dichotomy between the two. Whilst Marvel can provide a more light-hearted approach whilst still being entertaining and serious and cool, DC can actually be haunting and serious and much more adult.

I’m getting Taxi driver Scorsese vibes from this video

And this was only a teaser trailer

How about another joke??🤡

I want him to play the role of Joker again in the future.
Imagine Joaquin accept the Dr.Strange role in Marvel, he wouldn&#39;t become an Oscar Best Actor.Great decision.

Sheesh its been 2 years since this trailer came out 😳

Even Illuminatis realize this trailer it&#39;s to dangerous to be deleted

Here again, watching this masterpiece of a trailer.
Can’t believe it’s been 2 years since this trailer came out. It’s crazy how fast time flies

This trailer was better then the faking movie

2 years :)

Here before the description says 2 years

He who has ears to hear, let him hear: John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” God is good my friends, and He loves you!

whos here after watched zack snydyrs cut or justice league

Not really a goodmovie

This trailer is gold.

this came out on october 2019 which means it was 2 to 3 months away from covid-19. So basically you can say this movie is a tale before covid

Why is this being suggested now? Thanks YouTube. Also <a href="">#restorethesnyderverse</a>

I can’t believe it’s almost been two years

(EXCELLENT) 👌🤡⚘
The fact that i see alot of debate in the comments about who is better Joaquin or Heath just proves that Joaquin played his role to perfection.

Looking cool, Joker!

I used to think that my LOVELIFE was a tragedy... <a href="">1:58</a>

We are a millionaire
Still an awesome trailer

I keep coming back to watch this after already having seen the movie because it&#39;s so amazing. It&#39;s actually better than the movie, not because the movie isn&#39;t excellent, but  because the trailer is just a masterpiece.

2021¿
Amazing how this movie doesn&#39;t change Joker&#39;s backstory, it just modifies it a bit. The original Joker fell into a highly toxic pool and in this Movie, he feel into a toxic society. Society can as toxic as any chemical that is toxic.

one of the best teases of all times

After watching thar horrible Cruella Disney trailer, I had to come back here just to get my mind off of it. Love this movie ♥️♠️

“We stopped checking for monsters under our bed, when we realized they were inside us.” - The Joker

Who returned after watching the trailer Cruella??

ah yes.... this movie.... i asked my friends to come with me and watch this yet not one of them came... but i didnt care, went to watch it alone and tbh it feels even better

It&#39;s good that it predicted Cruella 2021

I&#39;m here after CRUELA treaser.   I love Phoenix and Emma.

The final seconds of this trailer are just spellbinding !

If there was an Oscar for the best trailer, this one would win it without a doubt.
OmG,seriously is @back remind to girlfriend and mother By somekind about JOKER I Watch!!!seriously Enchanting and Beautiful.

And now we got the batman coming up, this is exactly what we want from DC!

we live in a society

Looking back, this trailer was as good as a movie itself.

I’m here again after the Disney Cruella trailer.

Cruella sent me here
THIS IS NOT OVERRATED, THIS IS MASTERPIECE

Arthur would never hurt a dalmatian!!

<b>Who is here after watching Cruella?</b> I have the same feeling for both films.

Cruella
Cruella 2021 be like
Joker: When you bring me out, can you introduce me as “joker?”Cruella: I’m Curella.

Year later and this trailer still gives me goosebumps ....masterpiece

Cruella is proof that Disney doesn&#39;t have any original ideas left.

Who is here after Cruella?

Joker : ( Phoenix ) : &quot;I Used To Think My Life Was a Tragedy But Now I Realize It Was a Comedy.&quot;Joker ( Ledger ) : &quot;And I Thought My Jokes Were Bad.&quot;

I’m rewatching the trailer after watching the Cruella trailer as it’s basically a replica of this trailer.

Watch taxi driver then the king of comedy and then joker you have the first  film noir trilogy

This is the best thing to happen to DC since The Dark Knight (2008)

I was lucky to see this in the theaters... twice! That’s how good the movie is

just saw this movie last weekend and it was fucking awesome.

Only nawazuddin can give it justice if ever remake in bollywood

This is truly a masterpiece of a movie.

The background music, the acting, the appearance, the quality of this trailer gave me the chills of the good

Can&#39;t believe this xame out in 2019

Trash movie

This is the kind of movie - where you feel like an old timer saying &quot;they don&#39;t make them like this anymore!&quot; It&#39;s 2021 and it&#39;s still a groundbreaking masterpiece

Another hollywierd kid actor who grew up, Fck hm, Fck his “speech” and Fck all of you.

I think in lockdown we all feel like Arthur Fleck right now.

They: &#39;Available only on Netflix!&#39;Me: ha, here you go full HD: ｔｒａｉｌｅｒｓ．ｔｏhahaaha
Still one of the greatest if not the greatest trailer for a comic book movie.

.as a sinner
Glory to Ukraine
I want this on hindi 🔥

Why can&#39;t everyone, just for once, stop whining about whether MCU is better or the DCEU is and just enjoy the movies for what they are? Crybabies smh

We Need More Movies Like this from DC

This is the DC I remember

It&#39;s kind&#39;ve ironic that this was the last movie I saw in theaters before covid, and it perfectly reflects how people have felt in isolation. Or maybe I&#39;m just weird idk.

2021 and still watching this masterpiece

i cant stop laughing at this movement <a href="">2:13</a>

&quot; I Used To Think That My Life Is Tragedy But Now I Realise That It was Comedy &quot;-Joker

Childhood is when you idolize Batman. Adulthood is when you realize that Joker makes more sense.

I wish this was the Joker movie we got instead of the crap it was revealed as.

The best movie on the world
