thx

<a href="">1:25</a> kis actress ki awaz ki acting Hai???

I think this is the best performance by jahnvi

Bhai Puri movie one side or Zingat one side...
Singer  voice   ek dum..

And bakavas

Copy cat not good  over acting

Faltu

Yaar ya movie bhot acchi lgi manu 
Dhadak movie k liye<a href="">
Really such a disrespectful for a perfect classic Movie. Can&#39;t even come closer to Sairat.

<a href="">

Best move

Kch ni bro archies ka trailer dekh k aari
Doesn&#39;t the title of this movie dhadak remind you of the 2005 song jiya dhadak dhadak jaaye from the most disgusting film ever to come out in 2005 from the hard core scoundrels and villains of bollywood titled kalyug ?   This film also has an equally terrible ending . Make love not war . Live and let live in peace , harmony , and blissful dignity of youthful loving souls in love with each other whether gay or straight .

I really wish you guys in your decency hadn&#39;t robbed me of my Akai 29&quot; television set , my hush puppies size 11 shoes , my clothes and clothings , my cassettes , compact discs , and digital video discs . I made the mistake of trusting people who only entered my life to rob and steal all of my life&#39;s belongings and things in a terrifyingly traumatic financial fraud conspiracy aimed at honour killing murder violent bollywood style in their violently crooked mindset . This is not how friends are supposed to behave with each other. I trusted your integrity and you deceived me with your shameless dishonesty .

we love it movie

Superb movie 
I love this Trailer more than the movie 

I loved the movie so much... And the songs were too good specially the title track and obviously Zingat was fire

The ending broke my heart

A wonderful wonderful film.  Ishaan is a fantastic actor (Beyond the Clouds, Dhadak, A Suitable Boy).  I really hope he continues to choose well-written great films.

Remakewood 

Really hindi film makers haven&#39;t sense of film making... This is a biggest chutiyapa

&quot;You don&#39;t knoww...ooo....&quot;

Dhadak is more good than sairat i love dhadak 

eat this movie
Bt sairat is superhit

My favourite movie

No can replace sairat movie in Marathi cinema

Not even 10% of sairat

Channa Meriya punjabi movie remake
Hi

My name is parthvi 

just a masterpiece I have no other words left me in tears will forever stay in my heart

Watched it does multiple times..... Still can&#39;t get off it️️️
Janhvi and ishaans performance is incredible

The story is based on story of a pakistani couple ,,where a girl from rich family whose name was nargis got married to a taxi driver ,,go and search it And our directors shifted it to Hindu culture ,,,,Shame on such directors

What name this movie

Happy birthday Janhvi Kapoor

Real is real........Sairat 

Sairat became so popular that, it crossed the regional boundaries achieved cult status. It shouldn&#39;t have remade in hindi. As it didn&#39;t receive the audience love.

Puppy, meaning save the dog's body
The ending was gut wrenching 



I love this movie 

I love this movie unique love story  I ever scene but I cried many hours after watch this movie ️️ . But sairaat movie I didn&#39;t understand sairaat movie I really don&#39;t like sairaat because there are no action no drama And in dhadak U found comedy drama action everything 

Original moive is best

Ok cool

Bollywood is ig allergic to women/girls who aren&#39;t white or fair skinned or women who aren&#39;t &quot;eye candy&quot; And have to adhere to male gaze. Because simple normal women without makeup isn&#39;t acceptable in bollywood

Dadak and dadak song my emotions fillngs old memories 

no 1 movie
Super teaser

wow what a overacting
I have seen both Sairaat and Dhadak and honestly Dhadak was not so bad.

Instead of this movie, watch original Sairat in Marathi, it is just a masterpiece....

It seems faint in front of Sairat's trailer
Wonderful movie ️ I love it️️️
Ishaan ️
me crying whole night for the ending then 

realize it was just a movie me ; 

Meine orignal nhi dekhi Isliye mei ise bina kisi comparison ke free mind se judge kr rha hu Aur film achi thi aur mujhe bahut pasand ayi

Bloody bollywood / urdu wood/ dawoodwood can never make a movie properly. Just copy cats! It&#39;s better to watch original movie Sairat. No one among Bollywood bhaands can match the original.

Those time and now Bollywood bad Time

Very sad

So nice movie and so cute jhavin Kapoor

Udaipur is one of the best cities.
A bad movie
Ending is heart touching

My fv

Just watched this movie..ISHAN- Satisfied with Ishan.He deserves this movie..So talented and Impressive..Can be a superstar..BUTJANHVI- She is so fake and Irritating..Almost full movie..Her presence,expression,acting..everything..She irritates me a lot in this movie..Janhvi is just like Arjun kapoor..Even after 4 yrs she still not improved..that much..Whoever praises her in this movie didn&#39;t know A B C D of acting..Looks like she didn&#39;t prepared before her debut..nothing..OVER ALL MOVIE- It&#39;s okay..Average one..Idk why but I feel something is lacking in this movie..Idk what..Ending just broke heart..BTW Idk who chose Janhvi..Who can even  think that she can act..??!!So strange..and even today she is getting movie back to back..I mean why do we give chance to such person to improve when we have already so much talent out there..??If they really want to act,they should learn acting .and be prepared for it..just like Ishan..Ishan is also a starkid but he deserves to act..He proved it..If I talk about Sairat..Then this movie is obviously nothing in front of sairat..Sairat is a MASTERPIECE..while Dhadak is just a good attempt..

hii

Pathetic copy of Sairat. Jhanvi can&#39;t express emotions even if her life depended on it - very artificial and wooden.

Kya madarchod trailer haiSairat was masterpieceAnd this is tattipiece

this is Insult of sairat. can&#39;t be said in words what sairat is

Is this story true?

Exceptional storyline. Heart warming performance for both Jhanvi and the guy.One thing I love about sad ending movies is that they are hard to be forgotten.I remember king SRK .

Remake movie  original movie sairat

Movie is based on Caste system n Village life..But instead of village life there is everything...missed original theme which was picked by Nagaraj Manjule..

<a href="">#sairat</a> (Marathi)
Sad movie

Chana meriya Punjabi movie k copy kia h...fr b Punjabi version best h....
Bhai last seen me kill kyo Kara Diya Bhai , 10 minute pahle movie khatam kar deta ...

Just destroyed version of sairat by Bollywood 

This Could Be Uss....&lt;3️

Who will say this or Janvi's first movie what is he acting in?
Original is orginal.. Only Marathi ️

Very nice

Chlo koi to he jo tum logo ki ijat bca ke rhke he amitap bachan sir jhund nikalke

When will you copy your log?
I think sairat movie ka copy  song bhi copy

Sirat ki copy
Dhadak can never beat sairat

It was free. Only one visit was made. Only a bribe in Marathi
This movie copied by sairat

Dhadak 2 could be a return of jhanvi to take revenge with all kind of stunts Like she would spread this news that she gave her life(her character) and then go behind taking revengeHer mom would know nd dad would find outThen all sorts of actions At the end though she cant bring back her love nd kid she will live for them with her mom in that house and help the mankind be known for her wisdom nd write a new history achieving heights in her kid nd love&#39;s name.

4 years Of this Masterpiece Movie&#39;s Masterpiece Trailer.What a Romantic, Emotional &amp; HeartTouching movie!!

This movie is good but the original Marathi Movie &quot; SAIRAT &quot; is even better.

People think it&#39;s cult classic BUT it&#39;s INSPIRED from &quot;premiste&quot;(if u love..), based on true story. south movie...in which a Telugu boy falls for a tamil girl in tamil state. But in the end boy n girl r parted. Boy became mad. Girl got married to another person.  One day she meets him on the road n Identifies him. Husband is a gentleman takes care of wife n lover.Husband shares this story to movie team while travelling in a train..with his permission it turned into a movie.

Story not completed waiting for part 2 ..dhadak 2

The theme of the movie reminds me one of the episodes from aamir Khans show satyame vijeta where honour killings are covered. Cant believe this happens even in this day and age.

Just watched the movie. Surprisingly good performances from both debutantes but a tragic ending

Nepotism sucks. Go to hell Karan johar and star kids. Sairat is best no comparison. Dhadak is stupid. Copy cats.

Me before watching dhadak - jahnvi is Sridevi&#39;s daughter, kya acting hogiMe after watching dhadak - jahnvi is arjun Kapoor&#39;s sister

Ishaan Khatter ko ache scripts mile to bohot age jaayega. Shahid jese talented hai.Jahnvi acting is tatti anyways

Super movie

My fan is ishan hansome

Marathi= sairat budget= 4 crores,box office=110 crores.Hindi=dhadak budget=41 crores,box office=110 crores. True reality of bullywood.

the second party is sad. I preferred to solve the problem differently to give a good example. but the ending was shocking, but that&#39;s the reality unfortunately

I didn't even think of it as a series.
Hey, the remake was made from a good story.. Wisdom had gone to eat fodder.. This is not even the dust of Sairat's feet.. u just kidding
Very nice movie

Mujhe dhadak original movie dekhna hai

Even here I don't like you because you are great.

Amazig movie

Thats how ajay atul becomes buissnesman

Very emotional film

This movie is the remake of the first movie which I had not watched a blockbuster then I happened to watch this movie on big screen. When the movie was over I just got goose bumps just rushed out of theatre with my boy as the distance was not much. The movie ending part was worst then Ghajni movie which also I watched the ending part in that the heroine accidently dies because of gangster person revenge and in this movie these persons are victims of their own sex /love/ marrage vows which they could not keep and elope out of thinking of sex/marriage elope with nothing hand of couple

Janvi,s acting in this movie is awesome....

Full movie kha milegi

dhadak better than sairat

Sale of bastards, traitors, traitors, traitors, bastards, Bollywood people, the remake of our Marathi movie Sairat, made a different Gark out of hemp, the children of the bastard pigs, they have given you a lot of money, neither have you written the story, nor have you stolen the content or music from anywhere. Lete ho bhasdiwalo, agar dam he to South or copying Marathi films, do a band or bring some other story of your own, aaa you are traitors who like nepotism, beggars in front of the beggars. 
Well, the talented people should not give up their stupid acting but they are ashamed of doing it; they are launching the sons of the corrupt Bollywood, the traitors, traitors, scoundrels are the sons of the crooked nepotism people.

Today I see the movie on Amazon prime I fallen in love of this movie 5 of ️️️️️ movie..... amazing acting Janve man..... and Isshan sir awsome.....

The end of this film is so shocked

Favourite movie

0% acting.....bloody useless,,waste of Bollywood ( both)

what is this a dam tatti
Yeh hai star kids ki aukaat...it&#39;s an epic disaster filmNO STORYGHATIYA SCREENPLAYDIRECTION FALTUNO CHEMISTRYaise film hote hai kya...chiiNothing in this..POORA paisa nasht ho gaya...jab harry met sejal se bhi ghatiyaa

Bhaii story os lit but nepotism ruined it , still ishaan can be better , par jahanvi ne toh esa haga haii 
Watching this movie while in Udaipur

I never get bored seeing this film and also this couple..they are a harmonius couple, cute and they also have good acting...i wish them a brilliant career.️️

Jhanvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khattar's eyes are clear
Who all are here after 2 years just to dislike the trailer

If I don&#39;t like Jhanvi Kapoor&#39;s acting it is my opinion and if someone likes Jhanvi Kapoor&#39;s acting it is his or her opinion so you can&#39;t force a person to watch the movie as he or she already watch it to praise the lead person performance if I like the performance of Pankaj Tripathi it&#39;s my opinion when I have said I don&#39;t like Jhanvi Kapoor&#39;s performance it&#39;s my opinion but a woman called Prachit Goyal is saying that watch the movie and you will know Jhanvi Kapoor&#39;s acting I have already said that I have watch the movie then she is doing argument with me. Prachit Goyal if I have done wrong I&#39;m sorry and now also you say sorry to me  the matter will be clear

Kon kon chata hai ki sushant singh rajput phir se janam le aur  Bollywood mafia ko sabak sikhaye. Please reply kije

Although Sushant Singh Rajput is not our father but still we can do something for him that we will help a lot of talented underrated actors by making them superstars so that nepotism like we see in Bollywood will not happen again.
I am talking about one thing that there are a lot of trainers to teach the star kids, they take a lesson and you people don't know that star kids get like a doctor without an acting degree, why do they have good mentors and make star kids top actors. But let's see how many such outsiders are there in Bollywood who are also proud but show how many outsiders are there who have earned name but still there are few outsiders who despite being good talent remain underrated, that is why the main issue is how much support you give to the underrated actors. Then a time will come when there will be absolutely no nepotism in Bollywood. And Bollywood was like it used to be before, there was no nepotism.
Boycott Dharma productions.
Yeh Bollywood hai jaha par drugs ka karobar hota hai

As see people supported Gully Boy than Chhichhore.  I&#39;m sorry to say but this is true . I don&#39;t why some Indian people are supporting Gunjan Saxena:The Kargil Girl  the movie which has insulted Indian IAF and praising Jhanvi Kapoor&#39;s acting rather than supporting actors who are the jaan of these film not Jhanvi Kapoor. It proves that nepotism will not end in Bollywood if people really understand the talent what I&#39;m saying is 100% correct. I don&#39;t have problem with starkids but I have problem with karan johar who is launching those star kids who are not at all good. If you love Sushant Singh Rajput, then, boycott these star kids with no talent

I think audience are the main problem of nepotism because I don&#39;t see Jhanvi Kapoor as a good actress even sara ali khan and alia bhatt also . This proves that audience will be same as they were nepotism will never end in Bollywood.

Is movie mein ashutosh rana ki acting acchi thi

Faltu trailer

Bakwash flopppp film this film and is poor

Sairat is gem....dhadak sucks

Brother, I want to watch a movie right now, send it.
An actress who&#39;s only in the industry because of nepotism. I think each and every actors and actresses deserve to be in the industry. Not the ones who are the relatives of already established  artists. Of course they deserve a chance too but the thing is everyone should get equal and fair chance. This nepotism thing must end in Bollywood.

how many People are coming back everyday?
I can&#39;t complete to watch trailer. How to watch full movie???

Jhanvi face expressions are like woodCrying, laughing, angry every time her expression is same lolNowhere near sridevi

Very nice concept, and it&#39;s absolutely right,i love the movie bottom of my heart thanks making an unique movie

Who is here after watching gunjan saxena trailer !Fire 

If you watch any <a href="">#Bollywood</a> movie whose links are with PAK&#39;s ISI then you&#39;re funding them to use weapons against India. It&#39;s a war to protect India by not being at the border.

I have missed movies like Laila Majnu just for fun.
Ban Karan Johar movies
Nepo kids ruined the original movie!!! Such assholes

Kya Muje full movie ka link mil skta h dhadak ka I love it this movie plssss

Sorry, but Jhanvi is not even close to her mother. Sri Devi was the most amazing actress. Her expressions and emotions in any scene spoke volumes. Jhanvi was not made to act. The way she pronounces her words aren&#39;t even clear. I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s had some work done to her upper lip, but it doesn&#39;t look right. She&#39;s a pretty girl, maybe her strengths are elsewhere ‍️

 besssssttttttttt fim
Ek min yeh movie ayi thi? Cinema halls me?

Nepotism rockzzzz
Please ise star gold pe dikhao mai request karti hoo  Biggest Fan of Jahnvi kapoorPlease

Last part
Nepotism ki maa ki choot
Should we make Dhkak 2 or should we replace Jamvi?

Sairat actress was perfect for the role and this lady doesn’t suit the role

Comment section shows the love of nepo among indians,  for guys who think these kids have talent watch orginal pair From a nonmarathi

Oh adharma productions Orginal saiirat 100cr with newcomers no bullshitWhy cant you change bolly

Sairat is bettar than dhadak

Someone just give Mr. Karan Kumar Johar a reality check,launch star kids I don&#39;t give a single fuck but make sure that you don&#39;t destroy the lives of upcoming self-made actors while you do it. Bollywood is a whole new world and you don&#39;t get to rule it ,you&#39;re just a fucked up gay producer who thinks he&#39;s the king

Full Movie upload karo please

Mera to trailer dekh k hi sar fat gya tha movie to kbhi na dekhu

Only her skin is good.. Under that is a douchebag

Jhanvi kapoor is ugly as fuckkk

Bloody talentless star kids and Dharma Productions.

Nepotism

Janvi love you
About Karan
Nepotism sucks... Hence proved

Boycott starkids movie.
Best movie  4ever
Karan johar..the bastard chutiya......
Please give me link this movie.

Very bad,vaste of time

I think karan is the god father of nepotism ..he wants to talented actors or actresses to hide and star chilredn to highlight...they even not talent and average...shame on u

This trailer brought many memories!!! I have done dubsmash of some dialogues from this movie with some person back when it released but now that person isn&#39;t with me anymore!!!

I didn&#39;t like THE END of movieI thought there will be a HAPPY ENDING ️

I just like the way how JHANVI speaks

Original is best .... Sairat is one of my <a href="">fvrt.movie</a> ...  ....big fan from kerala

Trailer is so good when compared to the movie

Tamil iruka

Overacting

Punjabi movie is a copy of Channa Meriya
I thought the ending would be like&#39;AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER&#39; But..

Almost 2 years ago and I am still here <a href="">#Janhviaan</a>

Karan johar when you stop Introducing nepotism in Bollywood....Pls tell me and then Fuck off

Ending 
Dhadak is my favourite movie and janhvi and ishaan jodi is very best and janhvi acting is Very very very very very very very very nice and ishaan acting is also very very very nice

Brother, my friend, please upload it, I request you very much.
<a href="">0:17</a> what is the name of the song pls ? :)

Jhanvi&#39;s acting needs improvement and her voice is also not clear.Ishaan is too good..

Why are you Dharma production people and what other story is there for you? Today, you are making such time wasted, mind wasted, useless, meaningless movies. In which direction are you taking the society? A few lines on the world, Iqbal etc. .. Also pay attention to such story line. If you look at the mental status of the youth, you will understand.
Dhadak is a remake of a punjabi movie channa mereya and literally they no give any credit

Ye sairat ke samne 1percent b nai hai sairat is best

K

Dhadak is very beautiful film.very lovely 

Janhvi has her mothers lovely eyes

Sairat
Great movie...Janhvi is 

To insult your parents and run away for the sake of love is the end of such a life. First of all, whether your parents are rich or poor.
I ve just watched this movie.. the ending is so sad.. poor for their baby 

Par kuch bhi ho movie ek no hai bahut pyaari movie hai

Can&#39;t wait for another film of  janhvi and Ishaan .. Cute jodi

Watched it todayMy heart just broke up at the end ️Excellent acting Wonderful movie

Dhadak is amazing. Can&#39;t believe people hate it for being a remake. I personally, loved it. Both these actors did amazing. Ishaan and Janhvi were gorgeous. Art is all about different creations and interpretations. It didn&#39;t have to stick to the exact same storyline even if it is a remake. And for people like me, who haven&#39;t watched Sairat, this is THE movie. You may have not liked it as much if you have watched the original coz we tend to compare a lot. But as a Hindi remake, and for someone&#39;s first watch, it was beautiful. Underrated.

Nice g

The Indian society needs a cultural revolution. We need a leader, such as Chairman Mao.

Nice song
After Sairat this movie look like shit! Acting is very poor and a insult.....

What if he moves?
This movie has got place in my all time favourite movie`s list after 3 idiots! 

Abhi sairat nagraj will open his arms again but he will not be able to beat sairat.
End is bad of dhadak movie

Omg ending was terrible i watched it today this movie is really awesome and last scene is unbelievable but that&#39;s the sad reality of our country 

dito copy of chanaa mereya

Part 2 of this movie ??? I hope it does where jhanvi gona take revenge from her family for the lost of her husband and son.

Last two minutes was shocking 

I just watch this movie on &amp; picture ... It&#39;s mind blowing movie......I love this. Movie..very nice story

Yr i love the movie but last scene i really hate it.....it made me scared whn both fall from tarice

If there is no second Madhuri Dixit, no one can do it, no one can do it again, no one can replace Rajguru, no matter how much one wants to spend, no one can take the place of Rinku Rajguri, the solution of change is sent to the world by destroying everyone's place, so we have created it. no one can understand this thing
will not work
Booooo

<a href="">#over</a> acting picture copy paste from sairrat 

Came here after watching Sairat
Last seen is my heart broke

A beautiful film 
A every teenagers love story I loved itWatched 5 timesI never get bored

Favorite movie 🇮🇱🇮🇳🇮🇱
This movie ending last 2 minute I am shock yrkya Kiya end me

I don&#39;t know why janhvi doesn&#39;t get as much love as she deserves. She can definitely act and I believe it is the primary job of an actor and a primary factor to appreciate someone.

Abe chutuyo sairat ki saari ijjat nikal Di...not even 10℅ near to sairat.....

The ending hit me hard

Karan johar - Dhadak is best Nagraj Manjule - Hold my Deshi Daaru 
Guys watch original marathi sairat movie....do not ask for remake.
<a href="">1:15</a> I always get goosebumps 
well I liked janvi&#39;s acting better than Sara&#39;s people were badmouthing about janvi but not about Sara but are star kids

The movie you are watching is in need of psychological treatment.

Janhvi and ishaan my new otp, how gorgeous their performances in this movie, you stole my heart. God bless and good luck for these new talent of Bollywood.Again, dhadak is dhadak, my heartbeat.Ps : i prefer this movie than the original, why? Simply because it is a movie, i need something that stole my heart. And sairat could not do that, sorry

Dhaka Tera bahut amazing hai but nice

True love story with a heartbreaking ending

It&#39;s surely a shit  in front of Sairat.. Spoiled a masterpiece  !!!!!! Bollywood plz stay back from masterpieces made in regional languages... Plzzzzzzzzzz.......... <a href="">#Sairat</a>_<a href="">#Rinku</a>_archi_<a href="">#Parchya</a>_<a href="">#only</a>_sairat_#

totally nepotism

Last scene is suspended

Mai sochtithi ke jo ghar se vag kar sadi karte hai bo bohot khus rahte hai but this ending is so painful

When will Yar Dharak 2 come?
Jhanvi is ossm

this was a good  movie

Well polished one... but none of the remake is equal to the sairat... Nagraj Manjule just create a magic on his own way and one more thing no one near to rinku&#39;s acting for archi character even if u r big star.. I am from tamilnadu not Maharashtra

Watched this movie on my flight Bangkok to Dubai. Beautiful movie, Janhvi my goodness fell in love with her!!

best love story of bollywood

A crap remake of Sairat  Karan johar and Director should be punished

It&#39;s remake of Punjabi movie Chana mereya

jhanvi kapoor is not beautiful like sridevii

@1.43 
I am Very Glad I saw the Original First...Its just so much authentic .

We should not do value of discrimination

Early make dhoom sridevi. Now his daughter. Best of luk janhvi kapoor.

Awesomeness plus heart breaking combo!!!
Everything will be good if there is a happy ending.
This movie total copy by <b>Sairat</b> movie

It&#39;s the ditto copy of punjabi movie channa mereya

Beautiful movie

Tatti
Just watched the movie! One of the worst ever! The director should be condemned, like seriously!

bruhhhh they copied the punjabi movie channa merya , same tooooo same bruhh!!

Real love story nice movie

Remake of a punjabi movie

This is so gay

the flim is ok but the ending is very phaltu. maar diya koi insaaf nahi. aise kon khatam karta hai flim ko

<a href="">1:07</a> lol
Sairat ki mitti paleed movie ,...!! Bakwas , essence killer !!

Sad ending 
Great and well done  in acting  debut by both new actors janhvi and ishaan. Worked very hard , natural , confident and younger generation love in decisions. The ending needed a closing ceremony after what happened at the end.  Too much of silence.

Watch Channa meraya punjabi movie also awesome

Watch full movie soon
How many of you knows  that this movie is copy of masterpiece marathi film &quot;Sairat&quot;
