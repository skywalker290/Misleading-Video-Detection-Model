How Time Passed And. Argentina 🇦🇷 Did the Impossible ! Messi played his Ultimate Game !

That was not a penalty 

Who is here after Pogba got banned for 4 years from Football We Pogba fans know how Legendary he could&#39;ve become.But injuries and other issues Ruined his whole career 

I remember when I was watching the final when I was 6 years old I was so happy with Mbappe&#39;s goal

I remember when I was watching the final I was 6 years old I had thanks to Mbappe's goal
That should’t be penalnty

That 2018 Croatia team was something man

CRİSTİANO RONALDO DOS SANTOS AVEİRO IS THE G.O.A.T
Thanks Croatia for this match.

eh piochey Pogba Pogba ; miss him every phucking day 
COMMON FRANCE W

Fifa world cup russia actually france won the game after 4-2  the movie or show starts after then

The start of VAR moments before disaster

How the time flies so fast5 years passed and so on.... I was only 14 on that time and I was read in class 8 in 2018.I was a JSC exam candidate on that time. 🇧🇩🇧🇩️️

Despite seeing an intense final of 2022, I am now feeling nostalgic for 2018 final. Now I realised how that time running behind so fast. That time of 2018,I was reading in class 8 and also a JSC exam candidate.

That take the L dance was personal

With 2022 passed, I forget 2018 World Cup existed ‍️
Kylain Mbappe brilliant goal

Paul Pogba brilliant goal

Peresic has screamed that in

Congratulations both sides  well played France hard luck Croatia 
Best Final every France deserved️🇫🇷
2024 still here

<a href="">1:12</a> Look at the how the goalkeeper reacts, no hate but professional goalkeepers shouldn’t be reacting that slow in a World Cup final, it’s as if he saw it but conceded that he wouldn’t be able to stop it

France 🇫🇷
Come On Sports Football Bangladesh National Team !

Is anyone here in 2024 ?

Mbappe is almost on his special already at the time!
As an Indian 🇮🇳 i eagerly waiting for my country to Playing fifa world cup Hope it will happens one day

<a href="">1:08</a>

1:8

I am fan of Germany but I have a big admiration and respect for France’s football. France is the country that produces the most world class players (togheter with Brazil)

I am very happy that we have colonized many countries in Africa because without black players we are nothing. Instead of &quot;the blues&quot; our new name will be &quot;the Afriqains in blues jersey&quot;
This final was brilliant!!!

Pogba is exceptionel he is the reason they won the world cup bravo

<a href="">0:48</a> What does he mean, &quot;what a call ot have to make&quot; ? The rules are simple : hand = penalty , what&#39;s so hard about that ?

Only the complete national team of Argentina is more disgusting than Griezmann! This is not a penalty today. Africa is undeservedly first.

Didn’t Pogba score the winning goal?

I watched this match with my dad, we were cheering for France and we won, now his gone.  RIP Papa.  

What i found out after 1998, 2018 &amp; 2022 is that france is the new brazil &amp; croatia is the new holland

One of the most boring finals ever and 4 years later we have THE most iconic final in history

Dalic should have dropped Subasic for Kalinic.

Croatia were robbed!

<a href="">1:01</a> 
This was pogba at his prime his peak his best miss it and forever will 

<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>

2023 here

Everyone was for Croatia honestly

Boring wc final ever

Mbappe goal gave me goosebumps

<a href="">1:21</a>

I will win a World Cup  

Trophy celebrations in the rain are so much better

who will watch this in 2023

Gotta be honest. This was one of the deadest World Cups of all time

Lloris 

Peter drury what a commentator

5 years ago from this historic moment..

I’ll never forget this night. My husband and I were in Madrid for MADCool and bar hopping; it was live in every bar and there were Frenchies everywhere celebrating with their Spanish comrades. Quite an amazing time to be alive 

Imagine if Croatia won the 2018 World Cup!

Was that lahm!? Next to the World Cup!?

France 🇫🇷 was the best  final world cup 2022 also and they was deserved the title by winning again

France are mostly African descent

This is france

One of the worst final i have ever seen. It was one sided match.

The French lineup is awesome
Both Paul Pogba&#39;s left and right foot is fire..

Is this france for sure? All i can see are some players from africa

I remember the last few minutes of the game, my hearth was beating unbelivebly hard but i was praying for my country to win and score than 2 goals but i know the match was decieded by the refree but still, that moment was really intense and sad after Croatia lost

Cristiano Ronaldo 
Best match ever 
@<a href="">1:11</a>No one: Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Seriously…nobody: Peter Drury: Pogba…POGBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He is the best commenttator all around the world

Some say Croatia has small population… Uruguay has less than Croatia and has 2 world cups  Croatia can celebrate the 2nd place  1st is all and 2nd is nothing….

Africa All stars team wins the game

Aaaahhhhhhh France gets Penalties in every WC final they play

I was speechless. France celebrated winning the WC like Man City winning the UCL. Shame on them.

GRIEZMANN TAKE THE L

Africa 2.0 playing really well

Messi, Messi, Messi. This is old and no one should care. Messi one Qatar 2022 World Cup against France. The 2018 World Cup was one step below 2022 World Cup.Argentina v France for the final (France won the previous final), and Croatia grabbed third place (2nd place here). Argentina was eliminated by France in the round of 16 in 2018, and World Champions in 2022.If you say that France has been in more finals, you are ignoring Copa America finals because that is Argentina.

THE FIRST TEENAGE WORLD CUP FINAL GOAL SINCE PELEEEEEEEEEE HIMSELF

What was France doing to there mangener

2023 ?

Absolutely deserved L for croatia

I love Mbappe with PSG

Game Rating 7.5/10

Most Boring final ever.

Croatias keeper was so bad…

where is kante

As a Spanish I prefer wins France I love Croatia 🇭🇷 but i prefer France 🇲🇫

Who&#39;s here after world cup 2022

No way Griezmann did the &quot;take the L&quot; celebration in front of Croatians 

antoine griezzman celebration take the L so funny

“And Mbappe!!! The first teenage mutant ninja turtle to score in the World Cup final!!!”

Who is here after the WC 2022 FINAL:

I was really impressed by the match between France and Croatia in the final of the 2018 World Cup. Watching the game highlights again today through this video feels like a trip down memory lane. Well done to the French and Croatian players!
I remember my dad doing the Fortnite celebrate at me after griezman scored

France didn’t deserve the World Cup. They only beat Argentina in the round of 16 4-3 whilst Croatia beat them 3-0

yo

Pogba ....pogbaaaa..............

<a href="">1:10</a> what is Modric doing here

2018 two team defeated Argentina,2022 Argentina defeated both.. France &amp; croatia

Theft of the century

Gotta love that lucky &quot;penalty shot&quot; I stopped watching at that point tbh

U want this or that

Im so hungry for maine

Maije or seattle. Cena and undeterdakter
they&#39;ll be back

I was rooting for Croatia but had an uneasy feeling from the start about this. France were clearly better, more power and more skill.

-

who&#39;s the commentator

LA FRANCE A REMPORTE LA COUPE DU MONDE !

Respect for griezman. 
Seeing this rn in 2023, I felt like this was France vs the WorldThe same can be also considered for the 2022 final except being France and Portugal vs the World

One of the most beautiful World Cups in the history of soccer , counting everything ( logos , presentations , stadiums ...)

Congrats france for your first world cup

Africa not France

France 🇫🇷 2018 were special Mbappé At 19 was a goat  it took Messi till age 34 to win it

I was so cheering for Croatia that day but unfortunately this France team was so strong and they took care of my primary favorite in Round of 16 and then my 2nd favorite in this final the moment i saw the Mandzukic own goal i knew France was gonna take the cup home

This the only final of wc i don&#39;t really like 

They win 4-2.then they lose 4-2 against argentina

Why is noone talking about loris&#39;s goal keeping

Mpabbe and Haaland will be an even greater era then Ronaldo and Messi but they were great to watch to when they played in Spain.

Much better world cup then 2022  hope we see fotball party coming back in 2026 in USA ️

<a href="">1:55</a> does any one notice Kante? he look so cute

From today i hate perisic

Allons France !!!

We are the champions!!!!
Peter Drury always making a match look like a movie, absolute legend

The one and only reason I don&#39;t like mbappe, he made me cry back in 2018

Mbappe was an animal since the start

When a kid winning a world  cup so why you can,t.

4-2 finals 2018 France wins4-2 finals penalties 2022 Argentina wins

Croatia can beat anyone but france was waaaayy beyond their level. Similar to how Morocco got France to end their dream and Argentina was the one to stop a repeated France vs. Croatia 2022 final

Congratulations africa 

espetionly Luka Modric

france might best croatia BUT CROATIA IS STILL BETTER!:D

I want croatia to win:(

Best moment

MBAPEE- OH MY WOOOORD

2 minutesYep that&#39;s pretty much sums it up

&#39;FIFA would never let such a small nation to win the world cup. It was obvious that we were robbed in 2018&#39;-Mario Mandžukić

France is the best 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
A Croatian scored a goal for France 🇫🇷

Greatest robbery ive ever seen...

<a href="">1:10</a> bro went POGBA POGBAAA
<a href="">1:02</a> speak for its self

&quot;The first world cup final goal sicne pele himself&quot; That&#39;s how much of a great pele was and mbappe is going to be the best in the world too!

The worst ending in history
Greizmann:<b>runs, stops, emotes</b>
Mbappe
Look at prime france I was rooting for Argentina but still felt bad for France

So in 2018 world cup Russia Belgium gets third but in world cup 2022 Qatar they get grouped that makes no logical sense to me.

I am Indian and I was so happy the moment I saw France win in 2018. even though my own country doesn't play it, I have a very close connection with France because I #39;learned French from my favorite teacher for 2 years, I miss those days.
France coming here to cope now 

Many people will come to this video and they did not think that there were controversies but if they watch the entire game then they will see that two goals scored by France were controversial, the first from a non-existent free kick the second from a penalty that the Croatian where the arm was in a natural position and where unfortunately it was a penalty but what most caught the attention of that penalty was that Griezmann (who was caught on camera) tells or wants to tell the Croatian goalkeeper where he should shoot so he can score the second goal, Although later I realized that the Croatian goalkeeper in that final was injured and the question is who lets an injured goalkeeper play in a world final? I ask myself that question to this day because at least 3 of those 4 goals that France scored could at least have been avoided. (For me this final was either agreed or stolen from Croatia).

We not gonna talk about how 7 L Danced Croatia 

pogba him

I think 2018 world cup is best

<a href="">1:10</a> pogba..<a href="">1:20</a> mbappeCommmetry

Mbappe is a future GOAT

France️
<a href="">00:01</a>

mbappe is so young and winning wc final 

... if france one 4-2 but argentina scored 4 and france 2, 4-2????

The fact that the second ever teenager to score in a world cup final after Pele and after exactly 60 years is amazing!

Does anyone else not remember this at all? Like this did this even happen

For the ones saying bout the population of croatia , quality &gt; quantity, thank you.

2022 france is second and croatia third, they stick together always LoL

Pogpa,kante,griezmann,giroud and mbappe is the best

<a href="">1:21</a> mbappe has now scored a hattrick in the 2022 world cup, what a player he has real potential.

<a href="">1:01</a> bro just emoted take the L 

M BAPPE  is better of with the cup he does every thing for the team and he just gets the golden boot he is the reason why they won  and in the 2022 world cup. They  diden&#39;t win but he got them to the end . he does every thing for the team but gets a boot so you should let him get the cup next time France wins

Worst World Cup Final Ever! 
In the future I&#39;m a France player

Just a reminder that france could’ve won the 2022 word cup aswell, i mean, they reached the final without Benzema, Pogba, Kante, Kimpembe, and a lot of players.

Ref was paid off.

It was the best  world  cup final

Before there was Salt Bae..

Neither the match nor the final ceremony were as exciting as in 2022. Congratulations on 2018 France. But the best final in the world of all time was Qatar 2022.

Crotia and France Both Beat Argentina 2018 ! And Argentina beat both of the to win The World Cup 2022Thats is Something unbelievable !

Remember Mbappe was 19 at this time...

Netherlands &amp; Croatia are unluckiest teams ! Made it to multiple finals but ended as runners up!

Only a loser celebrates a penalty goal like that

Did you Know that France won 2018 world cup against Croatia by 4-2 and lost in 2022 against Argentina by 4-2 In penalty shootout

Argentina lost to both 2018 WC finalists in 2018Argentina beat both 2018 WC finalists in 2022A lot of things change in 4 years, wow

The only regret I have about this French win is that Pogba became a world cup winner.

“THE FIRST TEENAGER TO SCORE A WORLD CUP GOAL SINCE PELE”RIP PELE FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS ️ 
This is the worst final I&#39;ve ever seen No offence



Noooooooooooooo!

Croatia vs Africa

&quot;He has screamed that in.&quot; What an incredible commentary

2022 final Is the best !!! All drama tension sadness victory found in one game !!!!

Nothing excites than the final between argentina vs france 2022 final !!!

Messi is the GOAT.

French! You got this back in 2022!!! You were tought a lesson in 2006 and in 2008 from Italy, too!!! A loser gang, that&#39;s what the french team is.

Who is in 2023

Boring ending 
2022 final is the best final of all time 

<a href="">1:10</a>

France predicted their 2022 penalty score in 2018 

Rigged ..

I wonder why Paul pogba didn’t play with France this year?

This Time Argentina had the last laugh

<a href="">1:00</a> bro emoted on croatia 

A title that this year France was able to defend but Messi and company Argentina snatched the two-time world championship from them in 2018 🇫🇷 4 - 2 🇭🇷  2022 🇦🇷 3(4) - 3(2) 🇫🇷
Why would he tease the crowd… <a href="">1:02</a>

Mbappe: we r world championsMessi: no u r no longer ,we r the reigning Champs...the crown is with the GOAT

I&#39;m so glad france lost

France was missing pogba is this 22 world cup.

Even for 2018 <a href="">1:01</a> is cringe af

Why were the English commentators in 2018 much more exciting than the boring 2022 ones?

The L got me 

This is by far the best commentator

How the heck did Croatia make it to final??

2014 Messi cried, 2022 Messi is laughing all the way to Argentina. Now i can finally say Messi is the Greatest of all time.

The easiest world cup.
Andddd yeahhhh i found something strange out that France won against Croatia with 4-2  World Cup Russia but when I go back see final result Argentina Vs France World Cup Qatar it&#39;s ended up 4-2 again.coincidence???

Legends watching on 2022

who here after final wc 2022!!

Congratulations 
Bad Final when you see the Final in 2022

The commentator is super cool I wish he was in 2022 World Cup

How times fllies instead of france griezmann now mbappe takes france every penalty

My guy was doing the &quot;L&quot; dance  at the people.

The scoreboard of Croatia/France and France/Argentina is same but it&#39;s only in the penalty kicks

Mission failed. We’ll get them next time. lol

I hated this match The most boring final in the history of this tournament

Am I the only one who &quot;remembers&quot; that Croatia won in that final?

Croatia came 3rd in 1998 France. They then came 2nd in 2018 Russia.They now come 3rd in 2022 Qatar.Incredible team they have, very proud of their effort and work in these games. I hope they win themselves a gold one day (maybe in 2026?)

Russia 🇷🇺️ 2018 one of the best World Cups I have ever seen in my life 
2018: worst WC final of all time2022: best WC final of all time

they didn't have enough blacks
football is the best sport these world cups truly delivered, Vamos Argentina

Last goal show that poor performance by H.Loris., so 2022 wc  again this type of poor performance by h. Loris!!!

2018 france croatia 2022 Argentina france
Can we just forget about this World Cup and think how fun we expiernced yesterday 

Not going to lie this was a boring final and it was expected.

Where was Pogba, Benzema, Kante, Nkunku and more?

can&#39;t believe mbappe only 19 at that time

I came to Watch Mbappe after 2022 WC Final

Mbappe has to wait...

Finally, Here after Argentina the legendary Lionel Messi won ,2022 fifa wc final.

POV you&#39;re here after seeing argentina become champions 

now mbappe’s smile just gone

Croatia are very respectable given they have a population half that of my city

I am so happy the african team from France lost.

Diversity is a weakness.

Considering that Brazil won against Italy in 1994 (the year Brazil lost Ayrton Senna), lost to France in 1998 (France was the host) and won against Germany in 2002 (only to get beaten up by Germany 7-1 in 2014), will France make a comeback in 2026?

to think that 1 year before this mbappe would basically be a highschooler is insane.

Who are there in 2022 🇫🇷

France was just so close but Messi was there and congratulations mbappe Ik he was gonna get a hat trick and win golden boot and walk past the wc trophy like Messi did in 2014

i remember this match like it was yesterday omfg  highkey wanted france to win again this year but its ok ig(congo to argentina) 2026 better not disappoint tho(if 2026 is even gonna exist)

France won World Cup in 2018 with 4-2 in regular time.France lose World Cup in 2022 with 4-2 on penalties.

And Now France Lose versus Arentina

Can&#39;t believe mbappe won a FIFA World Cup at only 19!

Back here for Mbappe’s 2018 World Cup finals’ goal.

Who is here after watching 2022 worldcupArgentina - France ️

I wanted Messi to win his World Cup @ Quatar 2022 , even though as a nation, I supported France so the outcome was fine for me. Really glad it was a competitive match in the end rather than being a walkover for Argentina.

Whos here after argentina won the world cup 2022

Messi 
🇦🇷Messi 
France almost had it again! Croatia got really far too! Congrats to both!

Missed

the 1st and 2nd winners of 2018 are 2nd and 3rd winners consecutively now—idk if it&#39;s a coincidence or not

I didn,t see this type of commentary in 2022 final

The wolf cup has just began and France is 0-2 I have hope they will win   

The next World Cup final has started!

return this joy shortly to you and your people, O France 🇫🇷

I'm watching this 2 hours before the France Argentina final
Messi almost singlehandedly taking argentina into the final.Where they face a strong European opponentWe all have heard of this script before and it did not end well for them last time.Will history change or will it repeat itself,we&#39;ll find it out in less than five hours15 minutes to go and it looks like history will changeWell, mbappe just happened  2-2What a gameMesiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 3-2Destiny. Messi completes football

FRANCE MADE IT AGAIN TONIGHT. TWO STRAIGHT WORLD CUP FINAL WINNERS. CONGRATULATIONS!

Will Messi complete football and become the ultimate GOAT or will the French create history with consecutive WORLD CUP. just under five hours to find it out and i&#39;am starting to get very nervous

Here is the planet&#39;s ultimate game the final of the 21st football world cup

And Today we will stay on the top!

African all stars 1998 2018 2022
Legend watching in 2022 december

France gave away 2 goal so easily

Africa take it to Argentina so that Messi has nightmares until he retires from football
africance chapion 2022

<a href="">1:22</a> I&#39;ve never in a longtime seen a player like mbappe the dude is a just incredible in his own ways

Matt Ryan at it again guess he was like &quot;28-3 in the sb wasn&#39;t enough.....i can top that from 1x time to 2x time record holder&quot;

Tomorrow again!
Croatia cold breasts
France Two-time champion thanks to Fifaa
TOMORROW THE STORY REPEATS

Respect 🇭🇷
France is winning it again,

History will repeat tomorrow 🇫🇷

Maybe Mbeppa hasn't grown much since then? It's not the time to be playing in Ligue 1 even though you've won the Ballon d'Or for rice balls.
Don&#39;t worry Croatians, Messi will get them for you

Let go today we are on 2022 France 🇫🇷 the have to repeat the title like before let take that shoot let go FRANCE TO WIN  THE 3 cup on Qatar

Is it me or does nobody see the &quot;refereeing errors&quot; that favored France, for example the &quot;foul&quot; of the free kick to Griezmann that ended in a goal?Something more debatable is the Penalty that they gave to France with the hand of Perisic.

incredible World Cup Final

Super match
Wow, cool football!

<a href="">1:50</a>

I think france again win  thoughts massi dream ?

Let me know how many of you waiting for france vs argentina final ️

France was able to win thanks to the power of the descendants of immigrants.
Now France are in the finals again, this time, against Argentina

This wasn&#39;t worth a finalfor me best 2018 match was arg Vs france

that game won&#39;t happen against Argentina, believe me

Time  for France to win it again in 2022

This World Cup was full of blood because Russia was destroying Syria in these times
Did Benzema play this world Cup?

I&#39;m 19 and Mbappe scored a goal, and won the World Cup at a younger age than I am.  Nuts.

This world cup final is not interesting at all, Croatia made it look very easy for france

I seriously do not understand why it takes FIFA two days to upload highlights of the previous game in the 2022 world cup!

Mbappe, benzama, pogba..... Its their worldcup 2018

goalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

Slapped

4 yrs later, France is on the final again &amp; should defeat argentina in the finals

New champions Argentina

France win 2022

2022 World Cup champion is France 🇫🇷 

<a href="">1:25</a> chills since Pele!!

200214 July.
No foul free kick given to Griezmann and OG after that,then handball witch these days is not handball and wasn&#39;t then but given like FIFA always gives to those in need !! VAR is brought to this game so they can manipulate easier...

And now we’ve got 2022 and here they are again! France!!️

Looks like France is going to be the third to take a back to back win!

Thx russia for World Cup 🇷🇺 I will have 2018 wolrd,cup

France + africa vs croatia

I remember this day it went fast, hoped tye Croatia won that match. Hoping today that Morroco win the match against France or at least win against Croatia in the semi finals cause they really deserve it(Körkort)...Will be updated later in 2026/Jun/8...

THEIFA HELPING MESSI STEAL TROPHIES

France will get it again 2022

Croatia is the most underated team in football history, its insane that they have a population of 4.5 million and can produce one of the best football teams on earth, i got a feeling they winning again in 4 yrs

No way that it could beat France, Better team win the cup on that day.

<a href="">1:01</a> bro hit a fortnite emote 
Who is going to present the trophy at the start of the 2022 World Cup Final? Lahm did here, since he was the 2014 winning captain. If France, as expected, do go through to the final, Lloris would be playing that game and cannot do this trophy presentation.Edit : It turned out to be Iker Casillas in 2022, who also presented the trophy in 2014 final.

They are going to do the same thing again this year he his chian
France bought this match
just came back, after Croatia&#39;s loss against argentina

Let&#39;s repeat this again!! please I know the Quatari have a bias  for  argentine  white....  but France has to prove that they  are within that nucleus...   they must  prevail!!    Beat the  moroccans  and then beat  Argentina!!

is the 2022 French squad better than this one? Wondering if they can win Argentina

I hope Mbappe destroys Argentina. Qatar 22 is in favor for midget Messi to win. Every game ref is paid for midget Messi to score BS penalties.

Who is here again in 2022?

This time for Messi,s Argentine 

Congrats to this AFRIKAN-FRENCH football team fow win this world cup 2022 in Qatar

Am seeing crotia again to the finals

This time 2022 world cup final will be played by Croatia vs. France and next win see Croatia 1-0 France

Croatia I die with you

Most scandalous match Ive watched in such a big match.

Final world cup 2022 Will replay, between France vs Kroasia , and winner France

What happens if this happens again in the 2022 final?
if france v crotia on 2022... it&#39;s will be epic game !!

And France Can Do it again 🇨🇵

Morocco

Will happen again, with Croatia taking it home 2022

lets hope argentina takes it home this year 2022 🇦🇷

History is repeating itself this year,France all the way up.

Africa 2.0 = france
Man f France , anyone but them

This will happen again in 2022 final

Let’s see France vs Croatia again. I can’t wait this match 

Mbappe doesn’t deserve all the fame Antoine did a lot of work so I think he deserves it

This felt like a friendly game lol.

final terkonyol

Usess match ever one sided match

France will win the World Cup again-

That “Here’s Mbapeé, OH MY WORD, The first teenage World Cup final goal” is iconic

You all ready for rematch?

Crazy how it can happen again, but now they have a keeper!

Morocco 2022
for the uninitiated, the 1st french goal came from a free kick won by a blatant griezmann dive. moreover, it would have been disallowed under new rules because pogba who challenged mandzukic for the header was offside. the second one came from the penalty that according to the new rules (and old too, but vaguely) is not a punishable handball.

All the best Dominik Livakovic and the Entire Team ️🇭🇷
Mbappe life&#39;s = pele life&#39;s remake live action
Again??
need a repeat of this again 

and we might get the same match up again.

Croatia deserved the World Cup especially since they beat us (England)

Can&#39;t believe 4 years ago this occured. The greatest month of my life. 4 years later, it comes to an end. In a week, this will repeat itself. The planets ultimate game.

Can you imagine what they would have won that Final if it wasn't for the wrongly awarded penalty. Until then we were 1:1. Honestly, they would have given them at least 1 more goal by the end of the first half. 3 goal from France is a bouncer. The only honestly the best I&#39;m is goal 4.
Lol imagine it happen again

POV:Argentina win the world cup by 1-0

Argentina vs France final.

2018 final moroco verses crotia

Fifa 2022 Will Again......
I watched this and I think there is no fans for France!!! I don&#39;t know why?! May be someone says their blacks they are not French they are blacks... What a racist people  thinking like that!!! In the comment box full of Croatia fans!

Croatia never had a chance in this match and this new French squad is even stronger and dangerous.

Its December 11, 2022 and I believe Croatia vs France could happen again next week. My hope is Croatia will be the winner this time if happen.

All the Mexicans supporting Morocco, let’s go! 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
THIS TIME IT&#39;S FOR MOROCCO 
Rematch in 2022?

Why people saying no african team won a wc? Watch this video

<a href="">0:28</a> pure football

Croatia really went to the finals because of overtime, but it seems like it will happen again in the Qatar World Cup!! Croatia final gaza
Fun fact : You came here because you know it&#39;s going to be the same in 2022

Again and again it&#39;s possible 
Croatia will meet France again in the 2022 world cup final

Imagine Croatia vs France again

4 years later, both teams are one Match away from repeating the 2018 World Cup final.

<a href="">1:01</a>  
is this for England to won this year tonight we going send France home for sure

im still here, after 4 years. i have to say not deserved, refree on their side, he made sure france won.

Time flies We can see it again Croatia vs France...

Suarez, in South Africa 2010 (against Ghana). And Griezmann in Russia 2018... Two miserable beings.France scored their first goal in this match after a shameful dive from Griezmann, a sh!t-head. He deserves no respect whatsoever.

French West Africa Vs Croatia
The era before the Ukrainian war rolled around and Russia was boycotted from the 2022 elections
Wakanda vs Croatia
As a Brazilian I like coming back to this video to feel better about the loss (apparently people don&#39;t know how to take a Joke here )

And now Croatia is again in the semis

Go for it! Croatia

Pogbaa!.. Pogbaaaaa!!!

lets go frane again!!!   seriously!!   so serious!   go montreal  go quebec  go paris.. go france.   the best.. dont die!

Croatia take your revenge

They are coming again

2022 final rematch

<a href="">0:26</a> that skills of Ivan Persic are unbelievable. What a world class player.

I’m cheering Croatia all the way!

Still such a bad day for Croatia.Hope they will revange again and Croatia takes the cup home

Croatia will win this time for sure

Looks like rematch 2018 in 2022

Will revenge be possible in this World Cup? :00

Again  france vs Croatia
Fun fact: France vs Croatia can still happen again

FU Croatia.
I was rooting for Croatia during this game. It is sad that France won

Go blues
Hoping to see this again

The most useless and boring world cup final ever

Who wish coratia should win - so they take avenge 

Football World Cup

FIFA World Cup

2018 world Cup is my favourite.

Incredible how it started to pour down rain when they won too.

I must have skipped that 2018 world cup, and here we are 2022, time flies.

For france and possibly now the world.

France doesn’t even have pogba this World Cup and look unstoppable

VAR ruined the game, pinalty and offside

such a lame final, Croatia was against weak teams and always won in penalties or extra time. It&#39;s just lame, I hope Brasil take them out

Long live France!
Now I look back at this Cro have a better keeper now

France pay for winCroatia win in our hearts

Boring world cup final

hopefully we will see it this year
this dude really did a fortnite dance in a FIFA world cup final

It’s crazy how pogba can shoot with left and right foot

Africa world champion

I feel like penalty should be banned in final

Is it just me or was the Croatia goalkeeper not about it

Very strange that Croatia recived 4 goals on final when they were almost perfect on previous matches&quot; to play for a draw&quot;It looks  like an agreement between ..in which  France will have an easy win ..and France Football will give Ballon d or to capiten of Croatia LMThe &quot;Final&quot; was enough to celebrate for Croatia

France for 2022

That was a BS &quot;handball&quot; call that I and every Croatian will remember as turning the tide in France&#39;s favor.

&quot;The first teenage world cup final goal since Pele himself&quot; is the greatest achievement any footballer can ever achieve

Who is here this 2022 world cup again those franch guys are on fire again  I was not expecting this world cup franch to be on fire seems like more likely they will take this world cup again than the whole world cups will be boring franch guys keep collecting

France is in Africa?

The dumbest finall all of the time,,

France is the new Germany 

I hope we win again 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
The free kick by Griezmann on the first goal wasn’t a foul

France were Amazing 2018 I get enough of this game pooogba pooooooogba ...
Is this is the french team? I thought this was South Africa

bro did take the L

Poor goalkeepingThough

It&#39;s was the best moment

I am sure croatia and france will be in final again

Bro told the fans to take the L 

How half the french team were from the colonies.

It's going to be crazy on Sunday 
I do feel bad for croatia look at their goal keeper lol

What a match

Who&#39;s here after Tunesia choked France

Croatia goalkeeper didn’t even try on those goals

Was never rooting for either team but watching the ending brought a tear to my eye, the beautiful game will never die

Worst world cup final ever

Oui

I don&#39;t pay close attention to football, but I just realised that Mbappe was 19 when he scored a goal in this world cup final. Goodness gracious 

W

<a href="">0:58</a>

Croatia will win 2022 wc

No world cup can&#39;t reach the level of status of Qatar world cup 

Seeing Griezmans celebration is jarring lol

<a href="">1:02</a> FORTNITE LOL

I was in France at that time  the people where crazy and fired in the air 

I remember in the last 5 minutes of watching that game live on tv how I just didn’t stop doing the orthodox sign of the cross and very fast, just praying for Croatia to win! Wasn’t happy with France not taking it easy on them, but thinking about it now, I’m very impressed that Croatia made it the grand final!

Planets ultimate game… American laugh

I remember I was in a camping in southern France when France won, it was crazyCongratulations to Croatia from France 🇫🇷🇭🇷

France with only 2 French player kekw

What a blooper of a World Cup this was. Worst one I done ever seen.

I’m still wondering if benzema cried that he didn’t get to play because of a scandal 

Croatia should have won :(

France? More like Africa
Griezman is a fan of playing football, I swear I believe him
BELGUIM WAS BETTER

2018 WC&gt;2022 WC

Worst wc final ever. No one knows where Croatia is and how they reached the final. Was the least viewed final ever i didn&#39;t watch it.

africa world champion

Mbappe so underrated at this time

Amazing game, was so much fun live, congratulations France! My picks to win the 2022 World Cup again

4 Years, 4 Months and 5 Days LaterFIFA World Cup Qatar 2022

<b>Today a new World Cup begins after more than four years of waiting, so you have to enjoy it as if it were the last</b><b>Let&#39;s enjoy the great goals from the great matches of the great players and this last World Cup with 32 teams</b>

pov its 2022 and World Cup 2022 just started in Qatar

much respect for CROATIA

Man, it doesn’t feel like it’s been 4yrs but here we are, men &amp; women of culture… it’s on once again - LFG!!!

Fixed final

Many didn&#39;t enjoy this game. 6 goals is too many for a Fifa World cup final

Hiii

who’s here before qatar 2022?

This was the worst final out of the past 3. Everyone knew France would win although I wanted it to be close game it wasn&#39;t. Hopefully this world cup has a close, unpredictable final.

Been to Croatia a couple of times. Humble, traditional and honest people. And they barely have a right to be where they&#39;ve been as a footballing nation but that goes to show you just how hard working they are. It&#39;s not a coincidence either, the Bobans, Sukers and Srnas of the old days are proof of that.

“A penalty for France in the world cup final”. Thanks, I thought it was the FA Cup final

I&#39;m here before World Cup starts tomorrow

Tomorrow the 2022 World Cup begins 

This world cup final was insane, lets hope this one will be insane too

Bro I still can’t believe he fortnite danced in a World Cup final 

It doesn’t feel like its a wc final.old final games were felt diffetent ı mean ı remember the final between france and italy back then 2006. That game was feel like most importsnt thing in the world. I hope that this feeling come back in qatar

Tommorow a new world cup tournament starts 

One day for the new World Cup!!!!

So excited for the Qatar World Cup to start 

Legendary commentary

Time flies so fast....it was world cup 18 final ....and tomorrow is fifa world cup 2022 qatar

I didn't even see this World Cup properly. I was still recovering from 2014. But in the final, I preferred Croatia winning a cup for the first time. It would be much more beautiful. Sla, France is a team that you can't like - the 98 World Cup was bought. I said, I'm light!
Croatia done very well getting to final but i always felt some team wood hammer them England had 4 clear cut chances against them in semi Russia had at least 3 you don&#39;t win a world cup with a weak defense

goal

<a href="">1:01</a> bro accidentaly pressed the emote button

Hopefully the French national team will win again this year
The match felt like Croatia were handicapped from minute 60 onwards. Their energy levels disappeared. A shame because had they not been so exhausted we might&#39;ve seen one of the all time toughest finals in the world cup

Huge respect to Croatia but m&#39;y heart is going with France this time️

2022 Ajmoo Croatia. 🇭🇷
Crazy how 4 years passed, just like that …

Croatian team 100% Croatians.....France 95% African.

Not as memorable as 2010. But congratulations france

This year, I think france maybe eliminated from the group stage.

for the people who feel like roasting lloris for the mistake. The defender should have just cleared it but instead he passed it to a keeper who was being pressured.I am a fellow GK

The most rigged match in history of fifa

Respect

Griezmann deserves aids for the fortnite dance

Griezmann deserves aids for the fortnite dance

Griezmann deserves aids for the fortnite dance

Some forgotten final
Running midfield by kante and pogba was really scary. But how about the line up of midfield this 2022 WC?  Without including pogba and kante can make a different version of france?

Croatian goalkeeper was bought out

Griezmann will pay for that dive and that celebration when he scored pen

Why France always won World Cup at Home?????  

I remember going crazy when Croatia equalised it

Looking at this before 2022 wc and tbf he all knew france would win this game but for Croatia to score two goals it exceptional

Pure joy!!!!
Great dive by greizmann

Mostly African players from French team

Love the French 

Everytime this commentator speaks he gives me goosebumps 

It&#39;s not Team France it&#39;s Team Africa.

Pogbaa pogbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Time flies finally world cup in a month

There are too much dumbpeople who say france team isnt french just because a lot of players are not white. They were born and raised if france. Recieved french education at school and for football. They are french. You just sound jealous. They worked hard and deserved to win because they scored more than croatia. That’s all

Bunch of frauds - France. Every goal was a fraud goalMost pathetic world championsOnly Griezmann and Giroud were deserving world champions

Believe it or not!! I cried watching this Croatia vs France match when I saw the Croatian National Team lose. I pray that this year Croatia will be the champion.

nice

Qatar vs Ecuador its coming.........
World Cup champions, Congratulations, you have earned final game in trophy

The worst world cup ever completely ruined by var and bad teams

As a Croatian I will never forget this. I was so sad when they lost I was upset for 2 days after the final. I’m still so proud of them

I love croatia. I supported untill the final.

Hope France stays at group&#39;s phase this time. Only penaltis.

this is not a referee but a butcher absolutely shocking

horrible referee the worst ever

subasic was so bad

CROATIA WAS ROBBED

POGba!!

Right foot don’t work so used left foot. How easy it is for Pogba.

Still gives me goosebumps

Which country do you guys think is going to win this years world cup?

mbope

Just can’t thanks this proper English commentary, passion for everything, should have heard him live! I was in Hong Kong and I celebrated like no tomorrow!  finally and English commentator who has passion for football regardless of a full teams!

The most boring final in history, the penalty ruined the game

Pogbas goal was like a shot from training ground

That all CR7 &amp; Messi need 

World Cup 2022 final Brazil and France 🇧🇷3 🇫🇷1🇧🇷
Imagine if Croatia actually had a competent defense

our downfall started from here , hope we get well soon

Its time for Argentina 🇦🇷 now
Africa champions
Why does it keep saying “this video is not available” 

Croatia’s jersey look like Pizza Boxes
Mandzukic underrated af

I am very happy that we colonized many countries in Africa because without black and Islamic people our country is nothing in football
messi

Time files so fast and we&#39;re counting for the 2022 world cup

Can&#39;t wait to see 2022 cup

This last world cup was so boring!!! in fact I didn’t realized after 4 years Croatia made it to the final match vs France , France 98 and USA 94 were the best during my time, I hope this coming world cup becomes a classic

who else is here in anticipation for Qatar this year???

Africa

Croatia vs. Argentina 3:0,Croatia vs. france 2:4.Totally scores 5:4 win Cozzacs up Mushketeurs

Griezmann  what a player. France scored the 1st three goals all because of him. True MVP of the 2018 World Cup.

France is the best

incredible World Cup Final

Griezmann showing no class once again.

And India doesn&#39;t even qualify.... Any suggestion or reason???🇮🇳 @barryrichards
It&#39;s amazing 
Congratulations

Continent of Afrika vs small Croatia.... Croaria is the true winner

CROATIA WAS WONDERFUL IN THIS TOURNAMENT THEY WAS HOW BEAST VERY STRONG GUYS!!! POOR TEAM CROATIA THEY SHOULD HAVE WON WORLD CUP 2018
Penalty at that range can never be a penalty.

Perfect

pov: we all wanted Croatia to win 

4 years later and retards are still crying

<a href="">1:35</a>

the worst final of world cup history

VAR ruined the final

I’m going to be honest as a Croatian the scores should have been 2-1 For France but I’m still happy Croatia made it to the finals

I will forever hate griezmann for the celebration

Can France repeat?

Update: How Kylian Mbappe got a big head. (Still a dog tho)

France🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇦🇷🇧🇷🇪🇸a great video, Would you like to see some predictions for the 2022 world cup, it&#39;s amazing.

Love you, Hussain
O Allah, bless Muhammad and his
Bro I remember watching this finals at midnight and predicting France would win when my mom picked Croatia and I screamed when France won!

Boring final of world cup 2018 ...it was totally one side dominated by France. . If it was France vs England or Germany or Belgium If it was Croatia vs Belgium.It would hv been a thrilling final. France vs Croatia ,, Croatia in 2nd half had nothing to do.... It became like a Germany vs Brazil match of 2014.

<a href="">1:34</a> karius moment
Croatia the most legendary team in Eastern Europe togheter with hingary

Croatia deserved to win 🇭🇷 but football now is about money now  so, no surprise

Peter once again with pure poetic commentary

undeserved win

November 21st is when 2022 world cup begins

High Magic Rituals
Proud to be African seeing one of our nations win the World cup, they really made us proud.

African players score france wins

France won the world cup 2018 Respect France

Croatia is 1 place in my heart

<a href="">1:08</a> - <a href="">1:15</a>

Great for Croatia..
This match was so fixed it wasn’t even funny. France overated AF

She&#39;s so beautiful

Missing Karim Benzema the most,If he was there france team was fullfilled.Eventually he is going to Qatar with that trophy and also maybe with the balon dor.

I'M INTERESTING DOES ANY FOREIGNER KNOW WHERE THE FINAL WAS HELD IN WHAT ARENA
I really want it to be played during the final match between France and Singapore. It might be more fun.
For a world cup final this seems very underwhelming

What a match.

What? Croatia played against France in the World Cup Final 2018? I thought they played against Africa.

The first teenager to score in world cup final since pele this was the rise of legend mbappe

how is this happened in 2018 and it&#39;s 2022 now

Fr crying rhit now but fr

France was lucky

Argentina played better than Croatia against France,

In my opinion the top ten best teams in this world cup were1 France 2 Belgium3 Croatia 4 England5 Brazil6 russia7 uruguay8 sweden9 Argentina 10 Denmark

Most of them knew that their afcon nation will never win  the wc..traitor just for fame

Croatia goalkeeper was shambolic

Perisiç goal is exceptional
This world Cup final win belongs to Africa  very few of the France players were France natives

15.jul
It was a good game, the first world cup I watched
Perisic 
Persic:Goal and assist against england in the semi finalGoal against france in the final

Thanks France

Nice...

So excited with this commentary

France becomes first ever African team to win the world cup

Man love my team France let’s make history viva La France

It&#39;s just absolutely incredible to see a country that exists for only 30 years with a population of 4 mil citizens,  playing in the world cup final. Although they didn&#39;t win the game, it&#39;s still stunning.

It was totally a one sided match  at the end .. if it was France vz England it would hv been different i feel.

The Worst World Cup Final Ever

i have never stop watching these highlights

It’s crazy how we are 6 months away from the 2022 World Cup ! How time flies by

Man this is a cool coincidence, the 1st world cup final was 4-2

Kongo won it fair and square

Moment of madness Commentators are something else

Antonio who was dancing few days ago?

cant believe a  whole continent (africa) won a world cup

France weakened after 2021 Euro

----CROATIA IS YOUNG COUNTRY, 3 YEARS OLD WITH POPULATION OF 4MILION21998 WORLD CUP IN FRANCE-BRONZE MEDAL, WIN VS NETHERLAND 2:1 AND DAVOR ŠUKER WAS TOP SCORER WITH 6 GOALS----2018 WORLD CUP IN RUSSIA-SILVER MEDAL, 2:4 VS FRANCE IN FINALLUKA MODRIĆ GET REWARD FOR BEST PLAYER OF WORLD CUP..

Now that Croatian guy who scored will play with the spurs gk

good luck for France
This griezmann

Now who is after Croatia take the Revenge of the world cup 2018 final

Sad that Croatia didn&#39;t win, it would have been incredible if one of the games superpowers didn&#39;t win it, business as usual for the big team though.

Who&#39;s here after Croatia beat France?

Mmbape's words are going to weigh a lot, France eliminated from the group stage in Qatar 2022
Sadly if Croatia didn’t score an Own Goal and a handball foul, it would have been 2-2 which meant they would’ve had a chance of winning the World Cup.

my life very sad match 
FIFA world cup I respect and wish for gold, silver and bronze trophies for each World Cup.
I think croatia could won because they played much better than france, if you watched the game, france scored because of luck and then croatia fell apart

When commentator was saying &quot;perisić&quot;, in captions it is written as &quot;paris edge&quot;

As a Pole I must to say, that I was really happy,when France won.I was supporting France and I&#39;m proud because of that .

France will win 2022 wc in qatar

peter drury
Congrats Cameroon
Respect for Croatia 🇭🇷
Croatia deserved to win.

hahaha hugo
CROATIA!!! SHOW THAT AFRICAN COLONY HOW TO PLAY!!!!! TODAY!!!!! <a href="">20:45</a>!!!!
Amazing Croatia
Imagine if England defeated Croatia in the Semi-final

The only team in history to win the world cup with only 10 players playing during the whole championship.

Dam I forgot Croatia made it to the finals

Griezman taking the L on Croatia is sending me 

who was the man &amp; women with trophy in intro ?

I really wanted Croatia to win, but better team won. I always want a new country to win world cup

Are we ready for 2022?

This still feels like yesterday

France, greatest country in the world.

Time flies like a fly

POGBOOM  
Most pathetic world cup final

2022
Next for France?

foreign legion vs croatia
“Pogba! POGBA!!” 
I like how griezman sike croatia
Still watching this

I watch this video because i really miss the best version of griezmann

what a misfortune I love Croatia
This is the worst of all  world cup finals played  in 21st century

This is like friendly match goals

when Russia was still part of the world.

Gate ball use the brain

we don't care. The French were greeted with empty streets, and the Croats with a celebration of the victory code. That night, Zagreb caught fire and roared with celebration. I am proud to be Croatian 🇭🇷️
I can remember watching  this with my dad

Next follow the planet cup event

Boring final

my matuidi my friend is a true warrior
Pogba in EDF is one of the best midfielders of the world.

Croatia  is very  dangerous  futbol national  team against  everyone. Amazing

Next Finalists: Argentina vs Spain, and Spain wins
All some Africans in French
It was so funny when greizmann scored that penalty and did Take the L

Battles of Rae
I was in Munich Germany that time.. in India you don&#39;t see so much craze but back there though Germany was out of the world Cup but still there was football madness all over.. once France won all over the road people were celebrating.. bear, bottle of whiskey and dancing, honking, it was delight to see that craze..i too got some celebration with locals, French...still relish those photos..

Man, 2018 was something that you would like to go back to.

look at my video where Griezmann dived, thanks ref!!

Pogba , Pogbaaaaaaaaaa

I hope the owner of the channel puts confusion on the woman&#39;s face in the video. Because publishing pictures of women whose faces are apparent is not permissible in Islam
