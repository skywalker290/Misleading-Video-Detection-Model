Excellently made!!!

Kajol ma&#39;am is truly queen ❤

@Renuka Shahane mam you really done good picturising this movie and shown in purely realistic way of these women. Loved it ❤️

Renuka Shahane u r a gem
Wow kajol looks so young,

this day was my b&#39;day and i just saw this

From Hum Aapke Hai Kaun with the perfect family to Tribhanga where there&#39;s a real imperfect family really Renukaji is wonderful.

I cried like anything while watching last scene of the movie 😔... such a appreciable movie

Kajol’ s best.. ❤️ the last scene where all 3 women come together is so beautifully shot and speaks a thousand words! Worth a watch!Renuka Shahane… direct more movies 👏👏

What Kajol said at last was exactly what we experienced ! Loved all the characters all the leads, especially Kajol❣

Sweet movie

A beautiful sensitive movie. Must watch for all women 🥰 well done Renuka ji. And to all actors!

Masterpiece!

Renuka Sahane did ultimate job
Kajols acting was ridiculous

Didn&#39;t like this movie.

So inspirational movieWell done

Sanchita sahu:- she was looking very beautiful in Odishi costume....

I watched it today with My mom...Couldn&#39;t hold my years back..Amazinggg film

I love you kajol.......you are my one and only crush since childhood

Sweety u must watch this

Oh wow...superb kajol,mithila, charater of aurobindo..worth it..Renuka sahane mam..what a direction,story line all characters..

If u want to realize an unbelievable moment in your whole life then you should watch old movies of kajol and you&#39;ll be surprised by seeing her original skin tone &amp; face😄

The movie could be so better. It ultimately felt shallow since none of scenes were consistent. It was just a range of emotions without a proper graph. Better direction could have made it rememberable. We were just shown things and expected to feel something. Nayan was a writer but none of scenes showed her work or her style of working. Anu was a dancer but they didn&#39;t show her dancing at all. Masha&#39;s character didn&#39;t get much limelight. It seemed like her angle was abruptly thrown without much thought. It&#39;s all good that movies about women and by women are made more but this solo fact alone can&#39;t make the movie a masterpiece. I was just confused as to what was I supposed to feel. Anu&#39;s constant abusing seemed so forced. It didn&#39;t feel like a character trait rather felt unnatural. And what was the point of Milan&#39;s character. He was a caricature.

Kajol has used vulgar words a lot in this movie.

Tribhanga is a well made film ❤️ has few minute technical issues but overall it&#39;s worth your attention

Man this film touched my heart 💓❤️...
It&#39;s my story.. by the word... i am surprised how I can relate to the dot. I am Anu.. I am tribanga

Awful performance by Kajal.

Unfortunately Kajol speech was terrible to hear.All were perfect......sam

Nice movie.My goodness Kajol has a filthy gaaliyas

After seeing this movie, I felt i should have a better bonding with my mother who is not in this world anymore. For my daughters, I will try to be a better mom even better than my mom. Mom I Love You. Hare Krshna

ok🙂

Kajol&#39;s eyebrows are still very unique and I think no girl  can carry those eyebrows better than her!!😍

Shut your gob...idiot lady...useless concept n movie

the backbencher rap is out on my channel risten it i am a rapper

Saw it ..Renuka ji written and directed beautifullyyy.. Offcourse all actor performed very well🤘

Love the script..love the characters..wanted to see more of mithila character though...love you renuka mam for such a beautiful but real  script which can be watched with family . I dont know why male directors cant think of a family script without adding fighting and adult scenes. Lots of applaud to this film. 👏👏👏

Kajal ma&#39;am ✌️💥💥 great respect 🙏
This video should be watched by Pratik Borade who didn&#39;t understand this film at all!

Explaining the movie isn&#39;t BTS

Great movie after such a long time.

Netflix is ​​available
It’s sad to see  Kajol is obsessed about her lighter skin too; I wished she maintain being inspiration of black being beautiful

Loving Someone Truly But Realising U&#39;l Never Have Them In Ua Arms Kills Like Hell.

Mithila without her curly hair is like autumn without wind

What a movie it is.. I couldn&#39;t believe renuka is the director... She is a gem... Everyone acted their parts brilliantly..

Wow Netflix Wow 😲

THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME MAN! V different but VERYY engaging! LOVED ITTT!!!
at the end of it you see that greater good is about battling your own ego for some people and speaking up their voice for others. and being truthful really helps.

Dayum I didn&#39;t know Renuka Sahane directed it..... she&#39;s killing it in all

We need more hindi crime movies on netflix ): or web series~ Or like terrorist movies yk ;)

Sab theek hai except GALIYA!!!!

I love Renuka Shahane!

The way Kajol acted in that beating scene in the middle and then with her mother - she was really at some other level , one of the best scene coming from any female actor after a long long time. Really no-one is like her ❤️ And she needs to act more !!

IN LOVE WITH THIS CASTTT

A great story ❤

The title vibes like classical and  aesthetic...&#39;Tribhanga&#39; 🌼❤️

Early squad

It related depicts the thought &quot; jab tum maa banogu ringing samaz ayesha &quot; and then like a boomerang it comes back as to you

You can't watch it with your family because it's so bad.
First view.

Let me tell you a story...I always wanted to watch Netflix and be a cool dude....but my mom never accepted to pay and watch something...then Netflix releases streamfest in which we can watch Netflix for free for two days then I thought finally after the demo my mom would agree to pay subscribtion....But you know what....After the streamfest over my mom came to me and said never to watch Netflix, it&#39;s bad for you...(she probably found something adult stuff or something else)...And now I don&#39;t know how to convince her that what she saw was just a little and there is lots of good stuff to watch...🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

Anyone knows, When MoneyHeist season5 is releasing?

Aaj Test match ka Hero kon tha????1. Rishabh Pant 🔥2. Subhman Gill🎉
