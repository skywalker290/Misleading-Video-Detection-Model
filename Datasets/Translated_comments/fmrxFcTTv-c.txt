Corn dust is highly flammable especially when contained and not alot of vent to release the gases.

That’s how you burn calories

Fucking morons don&#39;t even know about grain dust

COOL this was better than expected

I also think this video is partly fake as no bin full of corn would catch fire

Interesting video but it probably collapse because they put too much corn in the bin

Very efficient dust removal system.

Do they not known? Shall we tell them?

Because grain is so small the surface area of all the grain is huge meaning the probably of a fire or explosion caused by friction is high

Sawdust grain dust ALL dust can be deadly and what often happens is a small dust explosion just a handful or two of dust when exploded will create a concussion that knocks more dust off of rafters and out of corners that instantly makes a larger dust explosion. If there is more dust then that will get knocked into the air by the second explosion  creating a near instant third dust explosion which can destroy a building and kill people.  There are OSHA materials about this.

Did the grain bin died?

Those people lived right down the road from me

<a href="">1:52</a> Big boom

And that people is why you never fill a silo to the top with corn. It is much heavier than wheat

People wonder why sparkless motor cost a lot and are necessary. This i one reason. If one fails say in a wood dust collector it can flatten a building if it&#39;s a large scale operation.

So what the full story?. Why did it collapse?

It still boggles me that people stand so close to something knowing it’s about to fall. Like they don’t have cameras that can zoom.

Popcorn anyone?

This happened near me a grain silo collapsed causing a fire it ended up burning the farmers house down

What’s really amazing about this is that is from good old bible bashing America and no one yelled….. OWE M’EYE GAAARD

Its pretty lucky that the grain eventually  extinguished the flame.

Se Türk Warmı

Holy!

<a href="">1:30</a> beginning

Why does it explode likw that

So very lucky that this was outside and not in a contained space. Glad everyone was okay!!

Corn flakes?

What was the heat source? Friction of grain?

What an absolutely crazy small world. I used to drive all around up that way for years on deliveries. Linton, Switz City, Westphalia, Lyons, Bloomfield, etc. Glad no one was injured. With the size of the explosion, that&#39;s very lucky.

Grandpa can run!

Can digestive explain how the structure even gets to this point of collapsing? What&#39;s the point of the giant metal pipes? Are they to fill it? Or was it part of the structure cuasing the collapse?

Thermobaric bomb in a nutshell

nothin&#39; but grain

yeeeeeeeeehaaawwwwwww!!!!!!

GET BACK GRANDPA

What exploded?

*might I add. I hope no one was hurt.

Sorry for your loss. Hope you had good insurance. ♥️

Why do women scream like that in any scenario

whose the dummy that didnt put stiffeners on? that&#39;s a gimme investment. i was in feed mill installing new dump conveyor and in underground tunnel,,,the Boss wanted to weld something and a bean dust bomb went off. i watered myself down first and laughed.

Fireball Jutsu!

wow.

&quot;Another day at the farm&quot;Felt that on a spiritual level

Baki brought me here

Way she goes

Imagine if that had been more contained . . .

I can&#39;t believe that you just stood there and didn&#39;t offer a helping handThis is a meme, if you take this sieriously you&#39;re a five yearold

This video was used in my firefighting class as a great example. Showed each and every step to a dust or grain explosion.

Barely saw the explosion with all the shaking

Someone better get some hot water and start making oatmeal or corn bread or something

We&#39;re gonna need a bigger broom

Snapchat &quot;fail army&quot; brought me here

PA announcement: Clean up on silo 4

did it make popcorn?

And people say nothing exciting ever happens on the farm.

Wow holy crap that was fast

Not really an explosion though... It obviously just flared up

Was this caused by Vacum?If it was water then air would get in the outlet and eventually get on the top to fill the void. But with grain (where the freshest and denser product is on top of a silo)  its gonna form a thick very airtight membrane that acts like a suction cup when the grain goes out. That buckled  silo.My theory atleast.

I think it was the kinectic pressure of all that mass that found a good spot to heat up the grain dust to the point that it ignited.

Holy fuck. Seeing that wall of flame materialize would have sent shit straight through to my boots!

Lol get that truck outta there

jadore

My teacher made us watch this in a triple science lesson.

POV you saw that Tik tok

These are my neighbors, and good ones.

Heres the real question.....did grandpa make it?

Dust explosions are so cool

Gotta love deflagration

Great, now I wanna throw a lit match into a cloud of cornstarch.  Thanks a lot, guys.

He ran like Forrest Gump

I live here!

Meanwhile inside a grain silo: <a href="">

Did it pop the tires on that red truck? Damn

Its all fun and games until

3 years later in Beirut...

I&#39;M 100th Sub

TOUMA!!

Explosion why????

I bet they wont have it, WOW they have it, canned bread

Why did it catch fire? The small grain dust particles creating friction..? Can anyone educate me on this please?

Don’t film vertical

How close were you to the bin while you were filming this? Did you feel any heat, wind, etc., from the explosion?

Trucks full

Ok, this fire is the most unexpected thing that i thought would happen

That really sucks. I wonder how much money was lost.

What even caused the collapse in the first place

It works with flour too... Test it, I dare you :x

@<a href="">1:42</a>

I realised this could have happened át lebbanon

<a href="">1:56</a>[The Roundabout Starts Playing]

Where did the fire come from

Imagine if that was kernels of pop-corn...

That &quot;son of a gun&quot; at <a href="">2:19</a> was like he just lost on a scratch off lol

Welp, at least the truck looks OK.

I&#39;m glad the guy says &#39;back up some more!&#39; a couple times.  Safety first.  I&#39;d be running.  It reminds me of a story a lady told she worked at a refinery in Houston or around there.  She said there were explosions (lots), and she ran.  Everybody was running and she outran all the guys that were running.  I got a kick out of that.  She was proud of that fact.That fire burned out quick.  I didn&#39;t hear a boom.  Good thing, there wasn&#39;t a shock wave or anything like that.

It’s going to be a windy day out with a touch of grain dust today folks

where did the fire go??? WTH?

Should&#39;ve shut down power to the system.

<a href="">1:30</a> -_-

Beirut 2020 ?

This is what caused the gold medal flour plant to explode...

Awww shit is right

So the BTO had a bad day.

When they said &quot;Get back&quot; they weren&#39;t kidding, Grandpa.

why the fuck would you waste so much grain. seriously. wtf.so many hungry cows. I grew up and live on a farm. this pisses me off.

Good thing there wasn’t fire and air inside the silo. It would be raining metal if that happened...

Man, I gotta remember this when I think I’m having a bad day!

I can joke about it cuz no one got hurt.

why did it burn??

Holy crap!

I guess this is the only video on the planet of a dust explosion

Anyone here because of Baki?

That...was an excellent summary of the plots of most action movies.

The calories you get from food have to come from somewhere. This is them coming out in a different way.

Imagine if that was flour

Isn&#39;t it only technically a grain dust <b>fire</b> and not a grain dust <b>explosion</b> since it wasn&#39;t in a contained environment?

Free Popcorn

Bad day at work.

Is the corn ok?

They always stressed this to the weldors at the ADM corn and sugar plants😰😰😰

That would be so scary

Why are you guys matter-of-factly talking about how the whole thing is a giant fucking disaster instead of screaming for everyone to get the hell away?

corny

Awesome

For all of the devastation and loss, I enjoyed the the man did not say 1 cuss word. I know he is a good man by that.

I live 5 minutes away from where this happened I am friends with the farmers in the video

<a href="">1:49</a> to go straight to the good part.

This is reassuring considering I&#39;m a month into my new job as a grain inspector.

Was it enough to make some popcorn?

Filmed with a potato.

Another day at the farm and a grain silo explodes food can be flammable

LMAO hit the deck !

What could possibly cause such a collapse?

Bet that burned a little!

It was barley a scratch.

<a href="">1:56</a> I thought it was fire but it’s actually yellow corn

That could be a static electricity grain dust explosion. Its a risk of the grains &quot;rubbing&quot; the ducts and bin walls. It could be that the power line was not the ignition &quot;spark&quot;. It is necessary to perform additional investigation.

It&#39;s Exploded!

also dude sounds exactly like Tom Arnold which makes it extra

lol idiots standing around for a vid, can&#39;t describe how funny watching the flash was, 0-200 but slow af

Mccall must have watched this video before killing Resnik.

긱하

Birds:hell yeah

Poor truck.

lol  <b>...nother day at the farm.</b>

How much was the truck

Souka

<b>GOBLIN SLAYER INTENSIFIES</b>

Equalizer 2: Spoiler AlertI wanted to confirm the bakery scene.  Now I know how dangerous it is to villains and hard working civilians.  Food can be very flammable indeed!

<a href="">1:55</a> michael bay: HNNNNNGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!

I wish you had a better camera

Making Moonshine !

Video starts at <a href="">1:45</a>

Subs for this vid is all wrong lol

Baki?

wow...

Holy crap that was wild!

ALL HAIL THE GOBLIN SLAYER XD

Wow, I don’t know that there is a better video they can show how quickly a real life dust explosion happens, thank you for sharing this and glad you’re all OK

Before now I had no idea this was possible. Scary stuff.

Awesome video/audio! Grain dust is powerful stuff!

Probably the cheapest explosive in the market.

I believe this is called pop corn.

Have watched videos of several bleve explosions. This is a similar situation. I think many (most) of these could&#39;ve been avoided. Suppose automatic fire surpression and massive water sprayers were placed thoughout all key areas. Same basic concept as building sprinkler systems. Also should include immediate power shut off to entire facility except emergency equipment powered by protected lines. This isn&#39;t rocket science, for God&#39;s sake. If properly designed, these almost surely would surpress fire, wash away flamable particles and keep areas cool enough to prevent explosions. Why aren&#39;t such systems in use now, especially in populated areas? Of course these would be costly. But consider the alternatives. As we all know, such explosions have happened many times. They WILL happen again. Murphy&#39;s law, for sure. It would appear there&#39;s no perfect set of avoidance preventive measues possible (obviously). Yes, I do understand high quaility &quot;housekeeping&quot; is a key preventive measure. But we must deal with the real world. Really would welcome comments from people with appropriate expertise.

i never knew why it caught on fire. if there were no poles, shall it combust?

Thank God no one was hurt.

Hopefully Insurance paid for the damage caused by improper engineering of the bin. The company who made the storage bin should be fined heavily.

What a strange way to make bread.

So cool!!!

Gotta love the deadly beauty of goddamn power lines. :\

Lol

where?

Where was this at
