I would like to applaud the vfx teams of Bollywood movies like coolie no 1 and radhe....... U guys are really rare..... 🤪

I think producers of Film Companion have special place for Sara in thier hearts.

Mam u look skinny then before

Nice movie colie no.1
Having a prime membership still didn&#39;t make me watch the film

Amazing Super Fantastic Mega Hit
Sara ali khan over acting ki dukan
How actors are soo illiterate to read the script... Anyhow it&#39;s really annoying movie

Stars should do Host and vj More than movie

What a shame that in India we still feel that it&#39;s dignified only if one is rich (even if one may be a cheat) but it&#39;s bad to be a porter by profession (even if one is really working hard to make an honest living). Imagine how a person who is a porter by profession would feel seeing this movie where their honest and hard work-driven profession is being ridiculed this badly. Shame on David Dhawan as well as to all that is a part of this movie.  Thanks for pointing out the pathetic and cheap mindset of this stupid movie maker.

If the producer makes 10 movies with same cast and team ,he will be a real coolie after 10th movie

This is the kind of movie that is a career ender for most actors and actresses...unless..the leads have influential parents. Both of the leads do, and thus their careers will be fine.

Damnnnnnnn the best part of the movie is watching this review 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Anupma savage mode on <a href="">#lovethehonesty</a>

So basically, anupama mam, is the one who supports such stupid actors, but she can&#39;t openly roast them, so she is using english to review them to show them less humiliated.

Please review gullak this kind of movie need more promotion

Its just not Sara Ali khan&#39;s choice of films. Its also the choice of producers and directors to stuff the films with the beaten down ideas and age old plot lines.

no one will watch bollywood nonsense now
Ye bollywood kitna baas ho bhi bhi but humne kar liya tha ab na ho paayega kya chutiyapa h bollywood dumb asses
Sara is too bad an actor

Seriously Anupama Chopra.. do you really care of review (without telling about the play  helping the kid before a running train..!) I know, you&#39;re doing your job of paid job analysis to make up to the mark! 🙏

Previous film Govinda could make you believe the character. He was good at what was asked to do.Varun requires back story

So basically this movie was also copied from South film.. lazy chutiyas

This is movie is punishment for people who make movie hit like judwa 2 and dhishum.we are culprit.These idiots consider  us chutiyas and we are....

total bakwaas movie
I am surprised that how paresh rawal sir  agreed to do this movie. Didn&#39;t he read the script. i have better image about him in my  mind  in terms of acting..

In Twitter people actually gave 3.5 stars for this movie. Bollywood is full of shit. I’ve seen the train scene and why can’t the people screaming can go and save the child.

Spot on Anupama. Thanks.

<a href="">2:31</a>-<a href="">2:35</a> 😂😂😂

OMG, what a cruel review

Bollywood is shame for india boycott shameless bullywood. Bollywood is a land of casting couch and murder.  Nepotism will kill Bollywood.

Why, oh dear lord.. Why?Why make such a horrible piece of garbage, specially in a time like this?🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
WHAT A LOAD OF SHIT!! THIS MOVIE IS SOO RUBBISH! Its an insult to the original and Govinda acting! What was the point in the remake???   Varun Dhawan is a good actor but this role did not suit him, he was out of his element and to follow in Govinda footstep he lookes childish! Sara Ali Khan DOES NOT know how to act, she had a few lines to say and appeared here and there and even then her acting looked amatueurish! She need acting lessons and gets by in the film industry because she is Saif Ali Khan&#39;s daughter! In this movie I think David Dhawan was thinking she can&#39;t act so make her wear skimpy sexy clothing as she looks damn hot she will get by! Dont get me wrong she looks DAMN HOT, but lacks the hotness and elegance and grace of a hot Krishma Kapoor. Sara looks very bimboish and sleezy!  The movie is a total flop and a waste of time I dont know who the crew and cast think there kidding when they say its a hit movie??? Whats so good about it?? Whats so new and original about it?? Same old songs which are performed way better in the old movie, both Varun and Sara copied steps from the old movie so whats so new, good or original about that? Varun tries to mimik the legend Mithun Chukraborty what a joke, Varun sounds like he&#39;s got a sore throat the whole movie and sounds nothing like the legendary Mithunda, an insult if you ask me! Im glad it was lockdown and I didn&#39;t waste my money and go the cinema and watch  RUBBISH like this on screen! I dont know why the producer and director are trying to pull wool over eyes! This is an insult to David Dhawan name and mostly to Govinda! Rather go and watch a south movie! Watching Sara Ali Khan act is like watching a porn movie, she hardly wears anything and might even be good at it because her screen acting is non existant for sure!! WASTE OF TIME!

Being articulate and confident in interviews doesn&#39;t make Sarah a good artist.  Film Companion seems to be confused on that front.

Y is Sara even getting roles???... Can&#39;t directors see what she is acting????..

“It hurts sara reduce herself to dancing vigorously and making faces” ooooof

Y cant u say jus varun did overacting.. y saying he did mithun n govinda n so many actors work n mixing them is impossible task to do.. his task was jus gud comic timing.. n he not even didnt do it.. on top of that did a very loud overacting.. jus say it ..

she should ve said u can watch coolie no. 1 on YouTube

Varun and Sara should really retire and spare us - FLOP actors !

Varun is copy cat We are no more intetrsted to watch his movie

How does this Bollywood fan women talking bad about Bollywood film??? Didn’t she get paid for the review?

I decided to watch the movie when I saw someone  commented so badly under varun&#39;s movie related posts and he replied as please watch the movie first and then scold as much as you want. So I just wanted to give it a try. But man it turned out be one of the tragedies that happened in 2020 and the sad fact is that both leads are still promoting the movie as some sort of a masterpiece of 2020.

Wasn&#39;t gonna watch the movie anyway but here I am to enjoy the roast

U can watch Coolie No. 1 on Amazon Prime (aside... I&#39;d rather u didn&#39;t). 😂😂

School intoxication has come on the road.
Present coolie no. 1 can never be compared with the earlier version starring govinda &amp; Karishma who are legends.

I would like to call this remake with more suitable title &quot;When your dad goes mad&quot;

When can Bollywood start making movies that doesn&#39;t deliver the free cringe factor. There is a tip: learn from South Indian movies at least !!

Full points for honesty.

Honestly agar govinda ki coolie  no1 k deleted scenes bhi release kar tay to iss movie say bhi very entertaining hoti... By god kalank movie k baad varun pein overacting kalank lag gaya...Waste of time...Govinda no 1 always..

Wakeup Bollywood wakeup

So bad... I only tolerated for 15 minutes

Sara Ali Khan’s acting in Kedarnath had substance due to intensive training and coaching by the super talented Sushant Singh Rajput who helped her with her performance The true hollow shell that Sara is - is becoming obvious now - movie after movie. Irritating, over acting and fake. Just because she is a fun small talk conversationalist doesn’t confer great histrionics and talent on her. Another privileged NEPO KID!!!

People who say Sara is improving is funny. Outsiders don’t get any chance of improvement they have to be perfect. Whereas nepo kids have always had a chance of trial n error. If this isn’t privilege then idk what is.

Varun dhawan is a flop actor...he <a href="">should.be</a> banned

Amanda cerny act&#39;s better than her😂😂

Over acting

Well said ma’am. I agree

You didn&#39;t find the dancers dressed in uniforms of officers of the Indian Armed Forces revolting? Because you clearly did not mention that though you spoke about nuns .  You are the biggest fraud too Anupama Chopra.

I enjoyed this review😂😂😂😂😂

Desperate attempt to review

In reality or in normal cases also Girls and theirs Father&#39;s r like this....n its true mam in reality Father&#39;s do sell daughter&#39;s nowadays....n this selling now a days is infamously known as divorse....

<a href="">4:25</a> after this review you still want us to watch coolie lollololololololol

Alia in sadak 2, Varun in coolie, which papa is making a movie for their Bacha next 🥺🤦

First time I liked her review .criticized a Nepo movie at last.

Bakwas film

How does the movie Lakshmi Bomb &quot;Al Takiya&quot; (Islamic deceit) and Love Jihad and what is the intention behind making this film? Watch this &quot;Jhatka Review&quot; in <a href="">
Same actor did Badlapur and October

This movie is an abomination to Bollywood cinema. Full stop.

2020 was the worst year for Sara Ali khan. Love aaj kal, drug controversy and now coolie no 1.

When the original was such a classic you had to remake it in 2020....but hey it’s 2020 🙄🙄🙄

Not watching any <a href="">#Gutterwood</a> movie Disgusting movie review

Don&#39;t waste your time guys ek dum Flop movie hain🤮
Sister, did you forget to give a star or have you given zero stars?
All movies
Nepotism sucks

“In the first song there’s a shot of Varun and Sara dancing on an upper deck of a pink double decker bus with NUNS swaying to the music behind them, what does this mean? I have no idea and neither does this film” 🤣 Nailed it.

BakwAss movie. Watch short movies. Talented cast is there. All.nepotism ki movie.

It would have been a blockbuster if had released in theaters. Trash like this have previously made 100 plus crores

Hope this will be the last disaster of 2020 😭

Sara really really need to work on her acting skills matlab sab movie me same expressions seriously

CUD HAVE SIMPLY SAID ..SPEND CRORES ON SUCH KIND OF FILM IN 21ST CENTURY ... A TOTAL FLOP ... SARA NO ACTING SKILLS JUST SMILE EVERY SECS CLOSIBG EYES ... EK CHINESE KO HI RAK DETEH.... QUEL HONTE GACHIS

Thank you for being honest ❤️
All the people in the Comment section should stop hating on Sara for her script selection. Y&#39;all never gave kedarnath the recognition it deserved before Sushant&#39;s death. And after his death Sara was discredited all the work. If masala entertainers and films earn more than artsy films like Kedarnath and October then there is nothing wrong if actors do them. The remakes have more hype and love than original. The original never got the appreciation it deserved and y&#39;all don&#39;t even let them do masala comedies. So they can&#39;t let their existence die in bollywood right???? Also Sara has Atrangi Re coming up and I am sure she is gonna prove everyone.

Stop acting Sara

This is the problem with Nepotism, we are not against Film star kids getting offers and roles in movies,we are against failed film star kids who continue to get new films and offers, even though they don&#39;t know acting, and their most of their movies flop. If an outsider actor&#39;s movie had flopped like this, then he would never get new movie offers and roles.But, when a film star kid&#39;s movie flops badly, they still get new movie roles, even though Indian audience does not like their movies.

What’s wrong with Sarah!! She’s ruining her career and Jhanvi is making much smarter choices.

Talent of nepo kids. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣How more low they will put themselves by acting like this and making rubbish movies. Boycott all nepo kids and their movies

She is right but why so many dislikes?

NepoAunty anu🙂👌

Really Sara? You went to Columbia....COLUMBIA!!!

What a utter nonsense movie. Don’t waste your time. Untalented star kids

Stupid Sarah Ali khan only acted well in Kedarnath only because of Shushant Singh Rajput and I wish and hope she never get success as she used SSR very badly

Literally 2020 is the worst year

Sara is the worst actress I have ever seen on a main stream movie !!! I loved her when I first saw her on LADKKI AAK MAARE and all of a sudden after watching love aaj kal I was like... eeehhhhhh... and now cooli no:1 omg 😱 such a waste

This film has ruined your mind.
Watching Paresh Rawal in this film is depressing. Side effects of joining BJP?

Wait so people actually watch this movie, I couldn&#39;t even watch the whole trailer... I sympathize with everyone who ever had to watch it 🙏

I m ded after watching coolie no.1😂

I like Sara&#39;s personality but girl needs to learn acting on a serious note, she is below Ananya too. I have not seen any of their movie but am judging them from their ad that we can&#39;t ignore apparently. I mean thats the standard, she is bad even on an ad. Even with rich legacy backing her she will not survive in the industry, if she justifies her movie with a good interview. Girl go attend drama class Or school because with drama graduate on their way to the industry, you guys will be out of job even with strong network.

She is dim witted 😂 🤮
Bollywood ki chamchi.🤮 such a bakwas movie

Why is a Hindi film review in English? Hypocrisy.
Chinna mapillai tamil film is a remake of telugu film coolie no 1 releases in 1991 if you want to tell the information then say it right

&quot;There was not a single frame in the movie that did not annoy me&quot; 😅😅😅

she always support bollywood than south indian films.. now digest

<a href="">#Bulliewood</a> is not worth spending your money on, <a href="">#boycottbollywood</a>.

Sara has absolutely no expressions on her face

Kha gya puri movie
She roasted the movie in a professional way (as a critic)

It was fine if you didn’t do the review because no one was willing to watch this movie either way.

This movie is a disaster man! This set up in today’s day and age is a disaster and as a comedy too it failed.

Why you won&#39;t Paava kadhaigal??

After seeing her review Gunjan Saxena and this review its obvious its a biased personal attack..saying that every single frame make her cringe?? Really??. Being a reviewer one shld understand this was not a drama art movie.. this was supposed to be a no brainer, no logic , feel good movie....it was light hearted fun movie and VD was superb. Just watch the movie and enjoy it... Sara s charachter does not need deep complexity to enjoy the movie. This was a massala movie.

The WORST movie I have ever seen. Over over acting by every single person specially Varun. How can a father make such a horrible film for his own son. This movie takes Indian cinema back by 20 years.

I loved the animation part and bollywood references.

That Manish Malhotra line 😂😂😂😂😂
most of the Govinda-Karisma Kapoor-David Dhawan-Shakti Kapoor-Kader Khan movies of 90s were extremely offensive and there was a lot of outrage against these movies during the 90s because of this kind of offensive and double meaning content and they think that in 2020 people will accept it? NO WAY!

This movie is better than inception ❤

Awesome review 👍
Sara ali khan is a Hindu by choice if you aint aware abt her faith.

Sara sounds like a woke liberal in her interviews but her filmography tells us another story.

I don't understand why coolie or any daily wage laborer needs to be judged on obsolete preconceived notion of racial discrimination. By calling 🌹 (rose) some other name instead of 🌹, its fragrance does not become impure. Call it black 🌹 or fair 🌹, it will remain 🌹. But cow dung, no matter how hard it tries, cannot become 🌹! Today's audience is mature enough so filmmakers can't fool viewers like this. People love and appreciate moreover they relate themselves to the characters if the story is well written. For example, watching Ayushman-Bhumi DUM LAGA KE HAISHAor Varun-Anushka starrer SUI DHAAGA is still relieving experience because characters are real, genuine and authentic.SENSE and SIMPLICITY. Both these movies show true middle class family situations which give us lesson of morality without making audience bored and hero of both films is lovely script rather than filmstars with massive fan following. Show real cinema and stop making remakes of classic hits. Everyone knows what happened to producer, director and actor who tried to collaborate for remaking SHOLAY,KARZ, SADAK and now coolie no. 1
thanks for asking! But, Nobody is interested in watching such nepotist films bollywood should change its time for real.

Madam, the review in Hindi seems good.
Sara Ali Khan is losing all the respect she earned through her interviews and first 2 films. To quote Donald Trump, “SAD”.

Hope Anupama that now you agree with Kangana when she talked about mediocrity,  NEPOTISM and the bollywood bubble.

for more insults like this subscribe to trash star kid family business and dont forget to check out their shiny figures in instagram then wait for anupama

Sara i love you i love the way you speak, your confidence,you being articulate,smart,educated,intelligent,graduate of an ivy league,classy,funny,humble, the way you carry yourself and your PERSONALITY damn thats amazinggg and i really really want you to be no.1 in your game cause you have all the qualities to get inspired from but Sara ACTING AND MOVIE CHOICES?? you were FABULOUS in kedarnath but after that the movies as well as performance wise you&#39;re getting down and what are these films you&#39;re chosing?? I know you work so hard as your costars often tell about that but please think about it, analyze it and work on it i know you can do this you passed your 4 years syllabus in 3 years and that too in columbia so yes you can do this too i hope your read this and work on it.GOOD LUCK.

Taran adarsh ​​gave 3.5 stars..
Honestly it is Varun Dhavan who should be given &quot;Kachra Award&quot; for the bad/over-acting. And Sara Ali Khan is just another show piece. Nothing can beat Karishma and Govinda&#39;s chemistry on-screen. It is one of the stupidest movie of 2020. I recommend sleeping for 2 hours than to watch this movie.

I so agreee.. dialogues were pathetic 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Maidam thura hindi bolna next time 😭
Look at her vocabulary... I loved it 😅

Watch behind the scenes of coolie no 1 <a href="">

such a BAD movie

I had zero expectations for this movie and i still felt dissapointed 😔I think Varun and David Dhawan have set out on a journey to destroy great childhood movies for children born in the 90&#39;s 😭 Poor Govinda didn&#39;t even get a cameo appearance in the remake of a movie that he made famous. But no doubt that if this movie were to be released in cinema then it would have become a super duper hit thanks to promotion and off course Indian&#39;s poor taste in good movies

Every time I think you can&#39;t make a movie worse than this bollywood surprises me

Star&#39;s kid&#39;s timepass movie. They make for themselves and watch it themselves. We do not watch all star kids movies.

Anupama is a paid reviewer boycott this nasty lady

Look at your efforts to do tatti 💩💩 but not coolie no1.
Her manish malhotra wardrobe had more complexity than her character ! 😁👍

Anupama mam got 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 for this super funny yet very  sophisticated movie review.Do you agree !!??
But were is your honest opinion about this film.

I am extremely surprised with Sara. In her initial interview on your channel she came across as a wise soul; and now to see her reduce herself to such ridiculous and downright unworthy piece of reel is disappointing. All that Ivy League education, worldly exposure and portraying such reductive character, how does one’s conscience even allow it.

I don&#39;t know for how many years we need to tolerate starkids Varun &amp; Sarah, and useless writer Farhad Samji.They would proved to be further useless in serious films. Thats why Varun film was flopped, Badlapur weight was carried by Nawaz itself. Each of them gets very tight slapped by web series true actors.

Watching these kind of movies on &#39;prime&#39; is like commiting &#39;crime&#39; for good content movies😂🙏

Aunty, why didn't you give a review of TENET??
Thank you David Dhawan for making this movie and for showing how brilliant and talented Govinda is and how useless and nepostic your son Varun dhawan is. Couldn’t take Varun and Sarah’s over acting for 15 minutes. *Varun Dhawan stop torturing audiences *

It&#39;s worst movie 🎥 acting really sucks ... If this movie too had done by Govinda it wud be so much fun

Worst remake.. everything bad

<b>Someone arrest David Dhawan before he ruins any more comedy classics of 90s</b>

In short the film is tatti ..... Nothing more than that 🤣

Varun dhawan career will be destroyed by his own father

This review has brilliant writing...

Shutdown Bollywood, turn on Hindi Cinema.

Why aren&#39;t Bollywood movies sent to the razzies🤔...I&#39;m sure we would have a truck load of awards from there by now😉

Dislike only because you are reviewing a Hindi movie in English.
Remake Ek No.1 Ka Wahiyat Aur Ghatiya Hai
Worst movie of the year 2020  total time wastage...horrible

Mam tell them to really as cooli they can do that job only not acting I never going to watch any movie from Bollywood now I am done

Garbage movie with full of over acting .. why waste money people’s time ...

Sara patli nahi hona tha .......Acting seekhni thi

Dabba class
This movie is joke of this year

Why does a mass market movie have to mean anything? Even John wick is senseless logically but well made,  Regardless this movie is a waste of time. Without criticizing on level of BS in this remake - the No. 1 hero Govinda ,  Kader khan, shakti kapoor &amp; karisma were unbeatable even if original was senseless and will miss them a lot. There will be comparison wherever there is recycling of movies. Ok, S.A.K. looks really hot in one song!

Thank you for maintaining honesty and sanity.

Though movie was bad but atleast varun tried. Sara failed to act...her dialogue delivery n expression are so pathetic

Must haven’t paid enough to give good reviews like SOTY

Hats off to all the people who dared to even watch this movie after watching the trailer. How can people even make such movies in 2020!

One of the reasons for me watching this movie was sara.. and she was the biggest disappointment in the film.. she is very very awful in emotional scenes.. her comic timing was also not good.. overall she was a poor performer.. I stopped watching it after the interval..

<a href="">4:25</a> No Anupama, after this video I doubt I&#39;d do so! 💁🏻‍♂️😅🤣
Ghani chu movie hai
Movies like this are like a full toss cricket ball and anupama hits a six every time.

Prachi desai ko hi le le..... Two nepo product..... I can't see sorry Anupama ji u love nepotism
Farhad Samji.... Enough said!

Kinda mad with all the attention Sara Ali Khan received even before her debut film released. She was passable in Kedarnath and turned cringeworthy with every passing film- not to mention her terrible choice of films. Even her interviews and her opinions are problematic if one looks closely. God knows why a Columbia graduate is so hyped, when this industry requires a different skill set all together 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

Do you memorize what you say? These same lines that you wrote in your review. Anyways, after ages, I agree with your review.

It's better to watch scam 1992 again
I&#39;m really angry at Amazon for acquiring this shit.

Hindi movie review in English 😂😂
Guys why is everyone judging dis movie soo much.....it&#39;s made for entertainment purpose....so just watch with an open mind ....have fun 😊

Watch this movie on telegram search on telegramZyw coolie no 1

Krk review dekho yr anupamachopra  is always give god review of nepokids movie

What is the point of reviewing this...simply say that this is a great BAKWAS movie..Baat Khatam.
Ha ha....how funny.....

Man I usually come on this channel to hate on anu mam but boy this women spit some facts today.Finally she realised she is Vidhu chopra&#39;s wife.

OMG you are irritated as a film critics. Keep writing blind articles bit..

Omg Sara&#39;s expressions during emotional scenes made me cringe so hard
Feeling sorry that you&#39;ve to watch it. I enjoyed this review thoroughly. ❤️🔥

Anupama saying &#39;Heaven on the docks man.. whiskey on the rocks man&#39; is my fav thing in the world lol

Sara ali khan is a decent conversationalist, nothing else. It’s the public’s fault for hyping her after 2 interviews

Sara Ali kha reduce herself ? Anupama chopra..what has she done till now ?? She is already reduced and compromised and yes these are yeh exact kind of movies these star kids should do. Please leave the good spirits for the real actors

I was wondering if Varun was using black face make up. This is disgusting 🤬🤬🤬🤬.
India is not only rapidly regressing politically but it seems as a society it&#39;s still so regressive and pathetic that less is said the better.

Dumbest acting by Sara and Varun.....he thinks he can act like Salman in judwa.....now he thinks he can act like Govinda 😂.....so David Dhawan don&#39;t need two actors to remake Partner🤣.....varun will do role of both of them.....

kudos for pointing out the brown face. David couldve casted another actor if his son is not brown enough. this is the sort of nepotism people are sick of,

Oh really? Her script is that way ! Also there is no KARANJOHAR to offer her female centric movies or shittiest movies. She got this in late 2018 and early 2019. For a young girl starting a career how can she reject DavidDhawan Film with Varun ? You Anupama and Rajeev hate Pataudi’s. Also SARA is gonna shine and how ♥️

Paresh Rawals role is insult...to... Kader Khan....and Varun Dhawan....is insult...to the old  movie coolie no 1 .... pathetic movie of a decade.....worst....yuk

Wonderful movie Varun dhawan Javed jaffrey paresh rawal have made us entertain superb job by Varun dhavan I want to watch it again

I started watching the film expecting a bad movie. But surprisingly it turned out to be much much muchhhh worst.

This film is shit. The makers and the writer should  be  trashed . Sara should take acting lessons first. Doubt whether it will help.

So disappointing, i think i just lose of money, time.

This is a roast not a review. But this film deserves it.

Worst movie, after 15mins i just switched off my tv.

Boycott copy film

And then Taran Adarsh came up with a 3.5 star rating to this trash 😂

&quot;Her Manish Malhotra wardrobe has more complexity than her character&quot; I CAN&quot;T EVEN!!  HAHAHAHA!!!!

Oh lord. If I could not watch the first one in the 90s, I certainly cannot watch this one now.

whattay

No ones interested  You could go blah blah blah

I want to thanks her for watching this movie and giving 1/3rd of her soul to die of boredom and cringeness

A peaceful roast ☮️
How to create shit on screen in Lockdown. Give to our bollywood father son or father daughter duo.😂😂😂

<a href="">

Bakwas film

I think she (Anupama Chopra) didn&#39;t even had to go through the trouble of watching it for this review. And  if she did watch the entire movie without pressing the +10 secs on prime video player, then she definitely is an iron lady

Bollywood is just suck coz of star kids casting, people are avoiding Bollywood movies and moving to Hollywood and regional cinema. Bollywood is the only reason why Hollywood movies getting great success in recent times.

Faltu movie

I &#39;ve never seen Anupama ma&#39; am giving review like this.🤢  I always thought that she probably don&#39;t want hurt the directors and producers feeling, even it&#39;s a bad movie But now 😎she reacted like common audience. So,  this is a kalank of indian movies 🤕. Thanks for review madam.

Varun wearing those gold rings and bracelet is a big lol.With Govinda the swag came naturally.

One day I will also reach 10k subscribers, InshaAllah😊Plz subscribe my channel.
<a href="">

Rumi Jaffery since 90s has had nothing to do as a writer except picking up plots from several films and blending into one.It was only Govinda and Kader Khan&#39;s ingenious acting skills that made those films nostalgic.

she can watch this crap but not torbaaz and notice how easy she went on varun, nepo kids ko khush bhi rakhna hain.

People are done with Sara. Sushant episode was the last nail on the coffin. Film industry will understand it soon!!!

Jab OCTOBER these movies will not be thrown to the ground and these movies will be made.
varun is mad, after giving films like october and sui dhaga, he is making coolie no 1. Judwa 2 was headache. This would be no less.

Wow..... can&#39;t believe you did a review for this pile of shit. You brought your level down by reviewing this movie. 😖😖😫

Feels sad That the Original Coolie No 1 is hailed as only a Govinda starrer . One cannot forget the Charm and superb perofrmace of Karisma too !... It&#39;s worth mentioning

Varun should really learn to say NO to his father ... David Dhawan should now look for better scripts rather than trying to establish his son as new Govinda or new Salman ...

want to watch this movie check my channel

Flop movie

Directly tell anupama ji that varun is a shit of our ass

Why are there English sub titles when the language spoken is also English? Am I missing something?

Farhad shamji should be arrested everytime he thinks of a movie...whether its writing a script/dialogues/direction

Just think about these PR people. Inko ye hhi defend karna padta h😂

This re-make is total BAKWAAS

I didn&#39;t watched coolie no.1 (1995)I watched this and i didn&#39;t feel any thing bad in it... It was a comedy movie and you should feel that it is new because of many reasons... Graphics was not good but everybody did well... I felt really good... Nothing was awkward to me...

Hit the like button who didn&#39;t like movie

Please watch opening scene of legend kader khan in original coolie no. 1...All questions will be answered..

Damn Anupama is bringing the heat 😂💀

U were still less harsh than sucharita

When will Bollywood stop making this kind of disaters ?

Sara is too greedy for commercial success, she will diminish soon. She should learn something from her contemporaries, Mrunal, Radhika, Jhanvi etc.

Anupama chopra is offencive herself. Watch how rohit shetty shut her down in multiple interviews. But some ppl dont shut up

no change
ditto duplicate of govinda story

Absolutely agree with reviews. Why did even David Dhawan thought making a remake of a Govinda movie. Govinda’s comic timing is something unbeatable.

Loll she ripped varun and david another one. 👏

It is better to watch Govinda's Coolie No. 1 again... that too for free...
Honestly, i think you should start a virtual honest film award distribution ceremony..

Love the brutality!! Hahah I wouldn’t watch this movie even if it’s free.. oh hang on it is free... and I’m not watching it!! Sara.. seriously woman get a grip!

finally someone truly said how problematic and regressive such movies are.

I have to say I am absolutely disappointed and ashamed of the hindi film industry. I as an audience was so proud of the movies coming out many years before. Now there is nothing to look forward to. And clearly directors and producers dont give an f what the audience wants or what is a respectable portrayal on screen. Literally what is there left of the hindi film industry than remakes and straight up plagiarism. I got into watching more hollywood movies in the past few weeks. And seriously those that used to tell you guys why you compare movies to hollywood movies and why you think they are better. I completely agree, there is just a larger amount of films coming out of hollywood that are actually amazing and tell fresh new stories. The hindi film industry seriously needs to pull up its socks, because its just making itself look stupid in front of the entire world. They dont have anything to be proud of if they make movies like coolie and laxxmi bomb. However, looking at the bright side, I enjoy the shows that are coming out on platforms as well as the chance given to underrated actors for the audience to see their talent, such as Pratik Gandhi, Jaideep Alhawat, Sharad Kelkar (and many more this year).

Can u please review paava kathaigal -Netflix

Jacky bhagnani is far better than varun on a lighter note, like if u agree

lol just the names of dialogue writers and movie writer were enough to help me understand the yoga jokes and christian jokes..........it seems the peacefuls like projecting their perversions onto others at the same time belittling them and doing their propaganda.......

Waiting for your Criminal Justice 2 review...

Your review was funnier than the entire film. Idk how self proclaimed crictics gave this a 3.5 starts😂😂😂

this movie is more painful than getting sick

SUSHANT SINGH RIP BOLLYWOOD

BOYCOTT BOLLYWOOD

AIB roast lite

<a href=""> vs Ak short review.... Happy Christmas
Waiting for Rajeev&#39;s review.....

Very bore movie and varun overacting

Go and decorate your Christmas tree and sit around fireplace and talk to your family, instead of wasting time of this movie...  marry Christmas everyone

No need of this full version of review  just two word don&#39;t watch

&quot;You can watch the movie on Amazon Prime Video.&quot;Me:-   <b>No, I don&#39;t think I will!</b>

I couldn&#39;t watch even 10 minutes. I feel for the reviewers who have to watch the entire film knowing it would only get worse.

This is what is said and what to do with it.
I told everyone last year that Janhvi is doing it slowly and chosing good projects. Sarah ia doing the opposite. Slow down Sarah and choose wisely

David Sir should take rest now .. plss.. Dadaji ho gaye hai aap ..ye movie dekhne Se achha toh mai Ashish Chanchlani ke vdo repeat dekh loonga..

Savage😂😂
Farhad shamji is pathetic why ppl give him opportunity. Sad

Anything Farhad Samji is associated with should be boycotted, that&#39;s how bad that guy is.

Bollywood all hit  film remake south film

Worst movie. Bad Influence.

Sumit kadel op
Copied movie.... Copied songs.... Copied acting....sons and daughters.... Nothing original....

Didn’t hold back 😂

Everyone is on Farha Samjhi's mind.
Hd is real 2019 is to see the level is current on from the year date mouth and arera. Ow restoreing fhe wifi now and data on the Web connection webcam ars back on but all public aarsra are in traînait training now so have a safe sage snapon wristband is a mouse not anymofe at all ok injoy your day ok

Sara&#39;s career is over after this film. 😂

Hope people stop expecting anything from Sara Ali khan and ignore her coz this is what she deserves. Useless product of nepotism

Everyone was just taking shits everywhere💩 smelly and unbearable ones 😂

Ban Farhad Samji from Bollywood. Why does the chaman get the benefit?
I couldn’t stand David Dhawan the first time around! Not again!

Sara&#39;s choice of films is not helping her, barring Kedarnath, her acting in all of them is nothing but monotonous and if I may add even irritating.  And I cannot stress this enough- She needs to work on her acting skills big time.

Why would you review this trash? This is not made for sense making. It’s for masses with low IQ and yeah just that. Don’t waste ur precious time Anu.

Still we didn&#39;t like u cause you are a hypothetical person

I think so credits were the only watchable thing in the movie

Plz dont ask us to watch film... Paap dhone padenge agar dekha to 😶

No i didn&#39;t like the review. You should have roasted them more.

At <a href="">4:15</a> I&#39;m dead  they have now started using nuns as props ??

Suddenly what happened to all the critics...how did the reviews seem genuine?
When you think being a professional movie critic is the best job, as your job is literally watching movies. But imagine you&#39;re forced to watch a bad movie, you can&#39;t walk away or sleep, you have to sit through the whole movie to review it. That&#39;s terrible!!!

Miss Varsa interview in the anupoma chopra show 🙁

Someone said the original Hindi coolie no 1 was remake of a 1991 Telugu film🤔

Great video 👍
Thank god atleast anupama is honest atleast

In the opening credit, They dint even took the effort to add a space between Varun and Dhawan It’s VarunDhawan .... so careless. What happened to Dhawan sir? Why sir...why?

Nepotism at peak in this film

What kind of review is ths..

In Short =Movie you have 😂
Varun is a good actor but he keeps doing his mistakes of choosing the movies 🤦🏻‍♂️and i think this movie is the worst work of varun its soo cringey , he was so good in October

such an idiotic movie...bunch of fools remaking a classic. govinda must be crying his eyes out.

Here is a trick. The moment you come across the name Farhad Samji, avoid the movie like the Bubonic Plague. Some of his gems are Houseful 4, Baaghi 3, Laxmii, Himmatwala, Policegiri, Boss, Dilwale, Judwaa 2!

Don&#39;t lie. You came here just to see her diss the movie.You already knew what to expect.

I knew this film was going to be bad. This has got be one of Anupama&#39;s most brutal reviews to date and rightfully so. &#39;Sara&#39;s Manesh Malhotra&#39;s wardrobe had more complexity than her character&#39; - Anupama Chopra &#39;20. I will never forget this epic statement. Omo, mehn.

Dear Anu,You didn&#39;t even have to review this 🤦

With India making so much interesting and original content nowadays, especially for OTT platforms, it makes FC look woefully out of touch to have its flagship reviewer, Anupama Chopra, clinging to reviewing only movies by large studios and young yet already dated heroes &amp; heroines. It brings the whole FC brand down.

Saw it today couldn&#39;t bear it for more than 15 minutes..

I don&#39;t remember the last time we watch decent comedy movie, Movies like hungama,hulchal, ajab prem ki gajab kahani are not made anymore, Priyadarshan Rajkumar Santoshi needs to return

It&#39;s a remake of Telugu film which is released in 1991

We understand why makers decided to remake as they knew that it would have been a financial success, if released in theatre in normal time. Understood, Varun wanted to work with his dad and recreate success of Judwaa 2, after his last 2 unsuccessful movies. But, what is disappointing for me is Sara, an Ivy league grad, agreeing to do a flowerpot, dimwit role in a movie full of sexism, body shamming, mockery of transgenders etc., just to be on big screen!!

I watched govindas coolie no. 1 to forget this coolie no. 1 BC

Imdb ratings 1.4/10 😀😀😀😀😃

You delivered &quot;Gucci, sacchi mucchi&quot; better than the film itself🤣🤣🤣🤣

ave budiya drama maat kar hindi mey bol
This review really opened up my eyes for good. I was not gonna watch the film anyway.. Then why  am I here? ... Oh! Anupama&#39;s words... 😄😄😄

audience - please varun pick good scripts.varun to audience- &quot;abba nahi manege&quot;

Worst movie I had ever seen 😭😭

Varun Dhawan is not good enough even to be a cheap copy of CHI CHI BHAIYA GOVINDA. Best of actors cannot match the effortless comedy and histrionics of GOVINDA.David Dhawan should not remake the old movies of GOVINDA.

A typical David Dhawan film is made for laugh ...that about it ...so spred smile and  happiness

It is a problematic film when u hear the words, Her Manish Malhotra clothes are more complex than her character. You did it again ma&#39;am. This review was much more charming than the film.

<a href="">2:44</a> Beautiful 💋💋love u💋💋
Varun was fab in the movie, I enjoyed alot👏👏

The fact that Judwaa 2 made a huge amount of money, prompted the Dhawans to go for another remake. Wrong decision...

The Pandemic has been a blessing in disguise. When all the shitty movies such as Coolie no 1, Laxmii etc are getting released with some originals such as 1992 Scam in the  OTT platform, they know what is their true worth. The movie mafia just hijacks every possible screen in multiplexes and then beat their chest to grand opening numbers. I wish this stays the norm for the coming times.

A bad movie existsAnupama:savage mode on
Anupama, But it was just talking of film&#39;s story. What about other aspects of  film

I love the classy way in which anupama bashes the creators of this tatti.

If Anupama were a non-Indian, I could understand it. But hell, why would she treat South Indian (Tamil in this case) films as a foreign thing so as to butcher their pronunciation. You could have asked Baddie for a voice note...zzzzz <b>facepalm</b>

&quot;Manish Malhotra wardrobe has more complexity than her character&quot;- I&#39;m dead

The only way to stop such films being made and released is to unsubscribe Amazon Prime right now!!!

How dare she?? How dare does Anupama say all the right things every time??And the only thing I disagree with is &quot;You can watch Coolie No.1 on Amazon Prime&quot; No Anupama, we won&#39;t. we definitely WON&#39;T.

i am sure this review is more entertaining than the film itself.

Review mai toh you are very sincere but when Varun or David or Sara comes for Interview you are in Aww of them

Sara ali khan is so overated!

How many more films to we have to tolerate Sara till we can write her off ? Honestly, she is tv material (VJ, hosting etc).

Anupama Chopra Mam knows how to burn someone to ashes while putting up a poker face 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Socho agar nuns ki jagah double decker bus par sadhuu hote tab kya hota? hahah.. dharam khatre mei aajata aur boycott trends hote har jagah..

How can Anupama be so heartless ..she says everything correctly and finally says ..watch Coolie no.1 on Amazon prime video ..come on 😭😭

Yo... 🤘
U Bollywood fools trolls our south movies...If u want hit,u should take and remake other industry movies,otherwise shutdown ur business....

How can you say a coolie cannot be in fair skin,  nahi matlab app kahena kya chahate ho madam.

<a href="">10:43</a> has the best 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Father Dhawan and Son Dhawan have to understand that Govindas effortless acting and comic timing isn&#39;t easy to <a href="">replicate.No</a> one can bring the charm he brought onscreen with him

The fact that Judwaa 2 earned an obscene amount makes me believe that there are still some people out in the universe who would enjoy this.

When a remake is just a fresh coat of paint on a pile of garbage it&#39;s not really a remake. It is just a bad, unoriginal film. In my opinion, Coolie no 1 (1995) was bad and the 2020 remake is also terrible. Bollywood. Stop. Remaking. Films. Eating your own dinner the next day that you shit out and calling it breakfast is not the idea here. You&#39;re still eating shit.

Sara should stop wasting her talent in stupid movies including Simmba

On some days i just feel sorry for the film critics

So it&#39;s a good movie to watch when high?

The fact that my subscription helped fund this trash really pains me 😣Btw great review ( or should I say roast) Anupama,  it was just brutal 🔥👍

The only punch line of javaid WELLDING KA CHASMA HAI KYA

Agar kisi ne suicide karna ho to Coolie no1 dekhlo This is the truth I don&#39;t hate anyone

Varun is a good sasta mimik artist in the movie..Bharpoor hagdiya..So sad for javed jaffari n paresh rawal both are such a good actors..Waste of talant

Again a rubbish movie by derogatory  and so called lead actors..!!(Varun and Sara)

Haha

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s Anu is talking about, the film was better than inception, and didn&#39;t offend any stereotypes.

Everyone says that another picture of his is useless. Is Saamji your consistency intact?
I can&#39;t believe Anupama woke up early in the morning and watched coolie no.1Christmas tree decorate kar leti !

I just typed coolie no 1,anupama review and you guys uploaded.Woah.Should have asked something else😅

We were preparing for the new strain of covid 19...Coolie no 1 came out of syllabus

Single frame that didn&#39;t annoy me. Sums up the whole movie  for me too 😅😅😅😅😅

Wow I&#39;m early.

lol giving it a big pass
