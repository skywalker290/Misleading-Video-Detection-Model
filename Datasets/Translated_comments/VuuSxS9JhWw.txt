Now a group will come to say that sara is better than janhvi. No matter who hates janhvi...i love her so much. I just admire this girl for being sooo strong even after facing a big loss in her life when she needed her mom most to make her proud with her first debut film. I admire her for controlling her tears and not shedding even one drop of tear before cameras and always presents herself happy. By the way she is also kind, humble, down to earth and extremely beautiful in and out. Love you janhvi

My queenie ️

The way she said &quot;tattiyanzz&quot;
I don’t know why since her very first day in Bollywood I have always loved her️ Cute and kind. Check all her videos where she gives money or food to the needy. That says it all about how good of a person she is️

Happiness family to mamji

I love her weird laughing sound  and her mannerisms

I&#39;m always a big fan of Jhanvi ️...

I just love  her voice there is some magic in it

I am laughing so hard I never imagined sridevi&#39;s daughter saying  &quot;tattiyas&quot;, onscreen, she so honest and pure
Cute ️
Love you janhvi baby️️️
She mentioned anushka️️️
It’s very sad she’s scared of Karan Johar. You shouldn’t be scared of anyone. Just cuz you don’t remember his birthday you will be put out?. Wth is that

Well many may hate her bcoz she comes under the counter of nepotism, but I must admit that she is just amazing !! She strives hard to prove herself and is confident everytime she speaks. She will definitely shine to the fullest and be famous..

Wo lugaiyan nahi hoti gaon mein jo khod khod ke ghar ke baatein dusron ko batati hein kuch esi he baatein in logo se ke jaati hein, imagine naa how is your mother, chcha, family bla bla bla bla ... aur saale hum khub chav se sunte hein because a) English seekh lege b) kitni down level fake acting krte hein c) there is an lugai in all of us 

The people who dumped her :absolutely stupid , regretting it now

My future wife.

Acting to badhiya h hi helpy nature acchaa h .janhvi ji ka

️ this girl

I love janhvi 
Who came after meme Hit like

I&#39;m here after watching this In Instagram

Tatiya 
Y d hell max interviewers  girly ?

She is so well-spoken. Can listen to her for a long with a sweet smile automatic came to face.

She looks ugly

<a href="">3:49</a> what a look man!!!!!

The way she was said to lie about trolls.. That was so cool 

Tatiya

i cant handle negative vibes and all of that please god save me

The look in her eyes.. the eyes altogether is enough to make one fall in love with her every time !!

Both Janhvi and Sara are shit

Gosh, Anushka out of all the world. please, stop.

Please  type Damaru Kathak Kendra and watch my dance tribute to Sridaviji.️️️️️️️️️️️
<a href="">2:22</a> chl jhoti yeah  your mother did not know that ....as if she hv never had any just chill moments

<a href=""> she is amazing ️
Very gay host

Do speak in Hindi, do not send Kapoor to Hollywood.
Please,,like Janhvi fans

Jhanvi gives more expressions in interviews than in movies

Janvi kpor very nice

Princess with the frog

Janvi kapoor looks good but she doesn&#39;t have talent in acting, born in actor family only.

B day gifts

Karan johar ka bhai h kya hai ...The way he spoke so I felt he might be ....
What an acting she knows her mother was brutally murdered wow

Because the interviewer is teaching you more... What is his interview?... Is this a stupid person?
Dusra log only beauty mai compare kartai

Sara and jhanvi r both different personalities and I love both of them Sara is smart and intelligent whereas jhanvi is cute and smart too ️

Vijayshanti look alike
Just kiddddddd just kid
Omg she&#39;s so cute man. She&#39;s so cute.Her million dollar giggle. Oh god. Kill me. Kill me now.
I love to see how overly modest and humble she is. Even though she&#39;s so privileged, and she&#39;s STILL down to Earth. The fact that she addresses this, and goes on to say how she should be grateful about the fact that she was born in such a family, and not take it for granted that she can get all of this easily, atleast compared to other people in the industry. The number of times she reiterated the words : &quot;I think&quot; is sole testament to how her perspective towards the world is. She believes in her statement, while repectfully telling the world that &quot;This is MY opinion, if it offends you, I&#39;m sorry, but this is how its going to be&quot;. She did say that she&#39;s not a big intellectual, or an intelligent human being, but all these traits, humility and wisdom, and most of all her being honest with her followers, is proof enough that she might just be (she is).      :) I mean, as far as I&#39;ve seen her (which isn&#39;t much), I feel that she&#39;s quite sensible, and even though she might not know what she&#39;s doing, she knows where she wants to get to finally, what her destination is and what she&#39;s destined for. She knows how to express herself while not hurting the sentiments of others. And, personally, she&#39;s the kind of person, one would like to take on a date (getting ahead of myself here, presumptuous - 100), and get to know better over a cup of joe, speaking freely, genuinely and candidly.I have also noticed that she speaks freely and openly, but also speaks sense. She doesn&#39;t speak gibberish, she takes the time with her words. One can actually feel the those words being filtered from her brain to her mouth. Last but not the least, I think she&#39;s extremely pretty, she carries herself with such grace, and she might not even know the amount of beauty she harnesses, but it&#39;s a godly amount, and that&#39;s one of the many things that make me go head over heels for her. Much love to her, and all the people reading this. &lt;33

Your acting is too bad.

I thought jhanvi&#39;s English is so Kiddish meaning even her voice but after seeing this she knows how she has to talk where She is matured I really accept

I LOVE YOU

The person taking the interview looks like mud
Iam sorry his voice makes me laugh.

Both Sara and Jhanvi are very good. They are better than Ananya.I wish i can see Sara and Jhanvi in a film.Hope dreams come true

The  comparison be like elon musk vs bill gates

I’m afraid to say but this guy is so creepy. What sorts of questions is he throwing at her. Lockdown terror watch

Really sweet nd real... 

So cute beauty as sridevi

<a href="">4:23</a> I thought someone was interviewing a wise woman.
Only 3,,,4,,, months she step a heads

She is fine, one year before,

<a href="">2:13</a> she sounded like shridevi ji

Janhvi&#39;s personality is just so mesmerizing

Sara,Janhvi do alag insaan hain ...so don&#39;t compare them...i love both of them

I feel she&#39;s being true &amp; yeah such a good taste Anushka

yogi
Is it necessary to speak English and there is a bakery here&quot; Hindi film may kam karna chata hai ya log. My name is my duty, Izzat kamiyab &quot;HIND&quot; is found and English language keeps making me laugh, what the FUCK.
I love jhanvi vryyy much... I don&#39;t kw y people like sara more than hr bt watch dhadak nd lv aaj kl....jhanvi is vry good actors thn sara even in beauty nd acting both... She is real.. She never shows herself that she is a star kid.. She is vryyy mature... Nd i lv hrr

Who ever is spreading hatred for Sara Ali Khan should know that she is what she is because of her own talent &amp;education &amp;manners.She also had a childhood which was not so &quot;normal&quot; she has seen her parents getting separated &amp;no matter how much  chirpy she seems about the matter in reality it did hits hard because she&#39;s also human.Just because touchwood she hasn&#39;t lost any of her parents doesn&#39;t make her life less difficult.And yet is stands graceful &amp;strong .And whatever she has achieved is because of her talent .She didn&#39;t have to go to any of the big producer &amp;director to get her launched with the tag of her parents , nor do she had to go under the knives of doctors to get her features corrected.opportunities have reached her because of her talent

He is the one who laughed at Hina khan for debuting in Cannes ! So bad of him !

CHILL has a different meaning for these people.
Don&#39;t ever watch it  if you  already watch a Jimmy Kimmel show

She is a super amazing person ️️️️️️️
I ️ Janhavi.  You are so sweet and beautiful
Please Don&#39;t  troll her. This girl has been through a lot and still keeps smiling. We should be inspired by her courage and support her because she only our age and a very important part of her life has been taken away suddenly.

l love janvi 
I love janvii she is outstanding yeahh

Janvikapoor ️️
Love you girl so much️️️
Wow jannvi I love you you are naturally your face uuummmaaaa️️
Tattiyaas 
<a href="">2:11</a> sridevi talks

Dear hater, janhvi is good in her own ways, polite, cute and humble so please stop debating on nepotism and making sara ali khan overrated....

Who has read this book? what went in
I love janvi 
Janhvi love  you
Hi. Janhvi how are doing &amp; do you know one thing.. Till now I didn&#39;t see ur movies.. How many films have you acted till now?  I don&#39;t have habit to go to theatre since 9 years &amp; in between I seen vikram movie in theater that is last

Bright future in films alone is not enough. Some actresses had a bright future in films but not in real life... Quit films and do something else  is my advice.

Chill??

I Love you dear Janhvi Kapoor

I love you janvi
Sara and Janhvi are both cute and genuine in their own ways. I really don&#39;t see the point of telling one better than the other

I love janhvi
All films sridevi he mentioned  I watched on zee TV.

Best newcomer️reminds me of her momlots of janhvi ️

Anchor is karan Johar small brother

U know janviji u and u family murderd her...

Jhanvi.
Wow people are such fools to accept a product of nepotism .... She aint even quarter of challenge as her mom ..neither has charm as well ... If der wasnt her family ..she wudn even selected for a street play

She is well spoken.

Sara and jhanvi are the only star kids whom I love

Janvi looks like Shreya Sharan.
Shes not being REAL. Slightly artificial and looks like she is copying someone

Chill

I don’t understand how someone who recently lost their mom can speak so casually about it. She says she has no memory of that b.s any daughter or son that loses a parent will never forget that moment and will show some sort of emotion. She answers the questions regarding her mom so casually and with little to no emotion. Seems a bit too fast to get over someone’s death

She reminds me of sridevi ji ️

She miss her mom️I love u janhvi. Wish u lots of success

You look too bad
But why doesn’t she remember her mother’s movies? Or is she pretending to be completely indifferent towards Sridevi’s movies??? I think she should learn to be the biggest fan of her mother as an actress as well. In some other interview she also said that she had seen just two or three movies of her mom. How can that be possible even??!! She is in the industry &amp; still known for being daughter of Sridevi otherwise she is just one  “average” movie old in the industry!

jahnavi is very pretty n her face is very refreshing all d tym ..her voice is more adorable ...

did she go to acting school ever?? is she better than all those who are studying acting and working hard ..does this shit bag deserve better than those all

I love this girl️

&quot;Your mom died few months ago. How are you feeling?&quot;Is this even a question to be asked? They literally have no brain in them. Jellyfish!!

She&#39;s honest. I don&#39;t know why people troll her. She may not be a good actress but she&#39;s new. I don&#39;t know why people hate her. She&#39;s introvert and shy

Inspite of oh shit!! She uses tattiyas 

She&#39;s the best️️

She&#39;s so strong she&#39;s handling it all alonewe should support her  she&#39;s so hard working and so sweet

now stupid fans promoting Sara writes  &quot; Who else thinks Sara is better than janhvi hit like &quot; with a random emojiiii,  that too with no content related to Sara ji... please grow uppp

This host is such a khusri ... OMG

This woman is something. She has such a positive aura , genuine smile and presents herself very well.

I hate this Jithesh Pillai... Such a nautanki... Filmfare did soo much injustice to Sridevi ji... When she could have won for English Vinglish.. And Mom.. and this stupid guy gave the award to less deserving ladies...

I love her laugh lol

Both Jhanvi and Sara are ladies who are coming into their own and should be encouraged

Guess jahnavi shd try south she resembles her legendary mom and can Excel

Janhvi is absolutely strong girl..! After the loss of mother, it’s really difficult to live in this world..! Yo go girl..!

Tattiayanz...@6.14
Wow..... Gorgeou. Great brother and sister. And Sonaam is like a best friend. Sonaam was the first person to approach to act in Dadhak to Sridevii

super jhanvi
It has been 3 yrs I lost my mom it was when I was 12 and I went the day next to school and principals made an announcement to observe a minute silence for my my mom and everyone was staring at me I got full marks as she had thought me the day before but everyone said that teacher gave me marks freely

It&#39;s very annoying when people try to compare Jhanvi and Sara. Wishing Jhanvi the best in her future. I rather watch Jhanvi&#39;s films and interviews than Sara&#39;s.

why are chakkas allowed to take interviews?

Why does she laugh like a horse?

sonam kapoor 2.0
I am big fan for janhvi 
IDK why I really like her. But she is awesome and adorable 

come to us/ chilled! in thiz part janvi exactly sound like shri devi 

Why every anchors tries to be like karan johar

Jhanvi over Sara any day ,Jhanvi is Soo beautiful like her Goddess mother Sridevi ️

Sara is over smart<a href="">#crook</a> in some mattrrs<a href="">#but</a> jhani Kapoor is real innocent #

Worst VoiceBollywood FanboyingCringe-worthy ExpressionsCrappy QuestionsGay-like accentWhat is this interviewer doing here ..

DHADAK GIRL..........LADY CRUSH....

Oky Sara or janvi both are product of nepotism nd the bitter truth is that Sara is very cunning that is why she acts normal and as a way that people could find her down to earth whereas jhanvi doesn&#39;t have that much knowledge how to act that way nd DNT know why people are like jhanvi=nepotism than dear people Sara is nontheless

She is sweet. Could not take my eyes off her. Hope to see her in more good films.

HER VOICE IS BEAUTIFUL
Omg she sound like sridevi when she imitate her u like a guy

Please interview Niti Talyor please

Please interview Niti Talyor please

She looks so much much better with this hair style.

Sara has created a strong fan brigade who fights for her everywhere

Love her her voice while she laugh

Vd
She is too good

Jeez what a ridiculous voice and presence Jitesh Pillai has..

Janhvi will come up with great success......its just a starting

Face poora plastic hai but she seems like a nice genuine person

Plsssss  now dont go on compare Sara and Jhanvi in comments

Janhavi is looking so cuttteee

The host laugh sme as saroj

Sridevi&#39;s innocence, shy and maturity is not there in this lady.Sridevi is completely different from these Bollywood clans, that&#39;s why everyone loved her...

Faltu...useless...complete with face surgery.
<b>Who came here for Vijay deverkonda</b>

The number of times she said &#39;like&#39; was more the the number of likesshe got .

What are you acting like?
I really love her

I can see and hear clearly sridevi ji&#39;s jhalak.. I love jahnvi really a lot because I love her mumma too so much

Aish Buddha ho gai .my god.
Iam fan of jhanvi kapoor

She is so cute n with lots of charms though... love u jaan

I don&#39;t why i find her face expression a bit sickki look.

She is lovely

I am not a fan of jhanvi.. But after seeing her in this interview, I ry started liking her... She&#39;s so cute humble and down to earth.. Very casual too

nice jan
This guy is so gayishss

Why are fans divided into sara squad and jahnvi squad.....these two are frnds for sure and have a healthy competition with each other...not the way u guys are making it

Obviously guys plzz don&#39;t compare coz sara is way better than her. Isse dekh k mujhe accidental actress n nepotism k alava kuch nh dikhta seriously Bollywood sirf nepotism pe chalne wala h bt I&#39;m happy k vicky Kaushal nawazuddin sir ayushman aparshakti khuranna pakaj tripathi rajkumar rao sara ali khan ishaan khattar kartik aryan are there. These are gems of Bollywood now.

Janhvi is very pretty like Sridevi.

She&#39;s another epic example of a dumb actress after alia bhatt.

Hahah she is too cute ...

Jhanvi don&#39;t care about the trolls wo tumhare pichche padhe hai kyu ki tum unse aage ho

Janhvi you looking amazing and don&#39;t compare the to falop Sara pagal hai sara

Love her so much

Best one was tatttiyaaansss

My birth date is also 25 may

I swere it’s a pain to see her after watchine sare ali khan...sorry

God bless her..:)

Jhanvi has an excellent voice, she’s superb. But this host  horrible accent.

How is she an actress? She looks so mediocre. Nepotism man!

I was fking mad the way he said &#39;may&#39;

I like her,she is cute.

Aww Janhvi is so cute, pure and beautiful!And stop comparing Sara and Janhvi! Lots of people writing &quot;Who else thinks Sara is better than Janhvi?&quot; , they have different personalities, so you can&#39;t compare them.

I also like Anushka Sharma

She is just beautiful and real 

it takes 3 years for a model to walk in lakme fashion week and she did just after 1 movie and she is not even capable

she do not deserve to be here .....oh nepotism at its peak

She is tslking lyk bby

Is it just me or does she really sound like her mom sometimes when she try to imitate her

Cringeworthy
No..you are not beautifull sorry. no acting skill only karan johar made her career

I really appreciate Jhanvi for the person she is and for her natural acting...she&#39;s gonna go far  Jhanvi, please don&#39;t bother about naysayers...you are the best darling  Hope to meet u up someday and take a snap together!! I see you not only as one of my fav actress but also as a younger sister 

Janvi  always strikes everyone with thier  attire and looks very beautiful

Janvi is very stylish and does  not compare to anyone

I just wanna know who is this guy???WTF

how does the process go&quot;&quot;.  seriously dude that&#39;s your opening question about the demise. First you have to be comfortable enough and lightly asking is preferable

She is so kind just love her

U r no were in front of Sara  full of plastic learn from Sara dear u r totally artificial

I like her innocence

I Love Janhvi..She Is My Favourite Actress..Don&#39;t Compare About Sara And Janhvi...They Are So Beautiful..Love Them..Janhvi Is Such A Beautiful Girl..Don&#39;t Compare Them...

loved her smile....thats really preety

Janhvi&#39;s smile
Janhvi and sara both are just wow

she is really sweet . Stop the comparasion it s so mean really ,you have the right to have a favourite but that doesn t mean hating on the other

In Hindi, why don't these people take bath? We are in India and not in England.
Janvi is so slow and num kind of character nothing special to be an heroine ... she looks so dump. ..Jhallii type

Shoe size 52????????? What? Are you sure Jangvie

How stupid are these anchors to ask her always about her mum!! How did you came out??? Seriously? Wanna  ur faces

<a href="">6:14</a>
Thank god , she is wearing clothes !!!

She&#39;s good

Tell smthg abt Sonam!!!

Jhanvi is cute innocent  like sri mam.Sara is bubbly like amrita

Jhanvi is so cute n very innocent girl nt very talkative like saara so what shez like a cute doll.....

Looks all dat matters !!
this is crazy br
This Jitesh pillai is so freakin annoying. The way he talks and stuff. Cant Filmfare get a better host?

Jhanvi is good then Sara please don&#39;t compared jhanvi with Sara after 5 year Sara well play the mother roles

I love jhanvi she is amazing I am biggest fan of sridevi jee love from balochistan

Sara and Jhanvi both carry different personalities, I love them both. 

She is so cute !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is that wannabe Karan Johar anchor gay?

Duck face

Stupid girl

I really really like Sara Ali khan️️

Jhanvi is my current  fav actress

Jhanvi is the best

I wish Sara and Janhvi would do modern day dola re dola or pinga. Sanjay leela Bhansale should thing about it

Man, I’m not hating but this Indian accent is very irritating.

shuchaa thee raghu meyi raaghaa aachaaalalllll aap kak dil dharkakan meekheeyi keeshaakee khushaa hu raaghaa dil ki ee meekeyi khushu bhu sheyi dil ji ji ji piyaar
She is so humble beautiful and mature like her mother

I think.she smokes alot

Why does every interview have to remind her of the time her mother passed away? You can clearly see she gets emotional... Just let her move on n stay strong

I wasn&#39;t fan of any celebrity in the world, now I have one ”Janhvi”.

I don’t even know how Jhanvi &amp; Arjun Kapoor even got into movies let alone their acting skills which clearly sucks especially her voice...they are clear examples of nepotism !!...just being a star kid (in her case superstar sridevi’s daughter) doesn’t mean that they are also a star (which includes the acting skills and looks) ...it’s usually an easy way out for them...I just feel she lacks the dedication and genuineness to be a role model or inspiration...With Sara Ali khan in the block, I am sure jhanvi doesnt stand a chance as I don’t think jhanvi is made for acting PS: I am not a Sara Ali khan fan as she is fairly new but comparisons are more in the line of acting skills, dedication and who wants to genuinely be an actor than who just wants easy fame !!

I love her 

Anyone is anushka sharma&#39;s fan...like me.

this kid needs sympathy ..unfortunately she is dum too...stuck in a criminal family...and dumb to top it..

She is so sweet and innocent girl..love her voice.

She is so beautiful  Continue being strong and do gud movieeees

Free main movie mil gayi isko.
After this I&#39;am in love with her...... she is real

She is fully plastic! Literally !Underwent 4 cosmetic surgeries to look like this

As dumb as Sonam Kapoor.

Now group of Sara supports will come to abuse Jhanvi and bullying and to troll her.How beautifully she talks and conducts herself. She is very careful selecting her films and choices.She will definitely a bright career in Bollywood.

i love janvi..i think she is better than sara...

I really like jhanvi. She is a humble sweet girl, feel very bad for her loss. She is gonna shine bright.

janhvi is so lovely.

she is soo cute

What kind of daughter she is ? She doesn&#39;t even know abt her mom&#39;s past films. Such a loser. Her mom was the one and only legend. She is not even 1% like Sridevi.

I don&#39;t hate janvi..but I feel she doesn&#39;t have the quality of being an actress..this is my opinion.. commented not to hurt anyone&#39;s feeling..

A new heartthrob in India?! I&#39;m pretty sure not many crush on a duck faced human being

Please do sara ali khan also

she learn so much from sara ali khan interviews and i can see the change

Like   Prabhas fans...

Who does this guy think he is  rushing her like he owns her... I know they aren&#39;t buddies, so little respect we would like to see. Thanks

She is veryy innocent....

She is very innocent

Luv Jhanvi, she is so cute and innocent

Vijay 
But <a href="">2:07</a> her mother herself has dated a lot of guys n even her father

I think Jhanvi is better than Sara when it comes to acting. Sara sure looks pretty but I was completely bowled over by Jhanvi&#39;s acting in Dhadak. Sara&#39;s debut was a non starter first of all.

She is trying Very hard to beat Sara but Sara is already a superstar and How dare a comparison between themSara is a columbia university graduate and janhvi is not even from college

I love the way she laughs

she praises anushka just for karan johar..very bad

In this looks, she is just flawlessly reminding me of sridevi ji. 

I love her energy
OMG  that mans English is so entertaining to hear  and why are they talking in English when they are both Indians don’t get the concept 

Jhanvi is soooo cute!!

I like her more than sara ali khan.

Don&#39;t compare Sara n jahvi they r best in their own ways btw fan of both

Asking about her mother wasn&#39;t the appropriate thing 

Janhvi is sooo cute and pretty 

Overrated shit.

Is he saroj khan&#39;s son?

Tatiya&#39;s r ausum theory
She is tooo cute and sensible i love her

Ooo Janvi!!  She is relay cute :) i like her simplicity

Jhanvi never shows attitude and had never used nepotism

Nice interview

Janhvi eyes is Soo sexy...itni sundr eyes hai janhvi ki n itni sundr hai janhvi...

Plastic

The host is Saroj Khan?

Janhvi and Sara are the most talented newcomers of 2018..... I for one thank “nepotism” for giving Hindi film industry these amazing entertainers️ Also because I have been called a product of nepotism myself  ..... only because I have the advantage of using my family/father’s name for getting things done in official capacity related to POK govt.....also I drop my sister’s name to get me photo shoot gigs n projects... I mean why not...?? Wouldn’t I be ungrateful for not taking the advantage..

I don&#39;t like her attitude who agree with that ?

Vijay devarakonda king of South India

OMG Jhanvi is such a darling. The way she honestly answers everything. She is so pure.  Hopefully she will always stay like this Masha Allah

Who is this creepy host? A Karan Johar wanna be! he won&#39;t get there at all

What a fucking irritating gay is taking the interview. Unnecessarily nkhe nkhen nkhen

Ye sobki to bohot fans mil jayegi par hum logoka koi fan vi nehi hoga or hum star kids vi nahi.... So in logo ko le ke kya hoga... Hum sirf comments karenge 

The host looks such a pervert.

Throughout the interview I had this adoring smile on my face looking at her ️ she’s so real and adorable..

Please english subtitle... 

High pitch headache

Tatiyaaaa.. 
She iz so cute
I love her..she is fabulous in her own way.. dont understand why people are so busy in comparing sara nd janhvi.. they both are amazing in different manners..

She’s suddenly more talkative since Sara has come along. Her answers to every question in other interviews was a shy and dingy “I don’t know only.”

I think she will go far. Best of luck!!!

why people call her plastic doll..... oh my god she is so gorgeous

The cute and psycho  I don&#39;t know if she looks like sree ma&#39;am but all that I can say is that she has got the same impishness that her mother used to carry. Janhvi is her own self, I don&#39;t wanna compare her to sree mam but this impishness is something she got right from her mother. Love you girl! Make yourself and everyone who loves you around proud 

She seems to be very strong

JANVI IS BEST 
SRIDEVI MAAM WAS A STRONG TOUGH WOMAN. MAY GOD BLESS HER SOUL.

But sara is much better

Among all the kids I just Love Janhvi and Sara..both of them are so sweet and honest.

Can she speak tamil? Just curious.

She is really pretty... I don&#39;t know why people hate her or call her plastic.

New word for hoodie - Khopcha !!!!

I just don’t like this host . Asking uncomfortable questions like aunties

Sara and jhanvi are best in their own ways

Jahnvi is looking lovely in this interview

She&#39;s fun

i think .. i think..

Anushka Shetty or Anushka Sharma????

Am waiting for Aish my favorite actress

Her &quot;tatiyans&quot; had me rofl
Shez so cute.. One of her Curse word &quot;tattiyas&quot;.. Rofl.. 

PLEASE CALL VARUN DHAWAN..I REALLY REMEMBER LAST TIME WHEN HE ARRIVED IT WAS SO FUN..PLEASE DO CALL HIM..WAITING FOR HIS INTERVIEW

Janhvi's fans
I just watched this for Vijay deverakonda..I heard that jhanvi talked something about him

Thank you so much....this girl seems sad all the time...now she looks happy.....

I hate her laugh,she laughs like a horse!!  Very ugly

Jhanvi s v cute and attractive.

The host is too gay

Arjun, his sister, Anshula, and their father involved in Sridevi&#39;s murder period: The whole world knows that, and so does GOD ALMIGHTY.  Just who are they fooling.  I hope and pray that Sridevi gets justice and rest in peace and those evils who did this to her, took her life, will burn in everlasting hell forever.  I think Janvi and Khushi are so vulnerable, and are unaware of Arjun&#39;s and Anshula&#39;s evil tactics.  Arjun must have been so determined to get rid of Sridevi, he hated her.  I wish Khushi and Janvi could see that their mother was murdered, by those evils.  I pray that God protects Sridevi&#39;s daughters from evil looking Anshula and Arjun.  They seem full of evil, and revenge.  I bet they&#39;re very jealous of Khushi and Janvi.  Kushi, and Janvi,  be aware of Arjun and Anshula&#39;s evil Tactics against you, they are responsible for your mother&#39;s death. Be strong and vigilant, they are not your siblings, but very dangerous evil snakes.  They are murderers.

Very funny accent, this guy is so irretating.

i&#39;m in love with janhvi 

Such a pure soul ,love her innocence.

Well, i would like to be honest...as im a human i prefer natural beauty instead of plastic surgery...so yess its harsh truth..sara is way way way better than jahnvi...people should stop comparing thm as thr is no camparison at all.

These star kids are so down to earth wether its sara or janvi i like it so much about them.

Jhanvi is so bold and so sexy and her voice is just a killer. I would just listen and listen to her voice and watch her smiling.

Tattiyaanzzz...... Omg.
The host&#39;s accent makes me misophonic

Love you jahnvi..... Reallly love you....... Your acting and the way you are... True.. Humble n always be happyyy

Such a sweet and beautiful girl she is I just mesmerized by her sweetness and her kindness very rare we can find these qualities are today&#39;s actress lot of love for you dear and much more happiness and success came in your way stay happy and kind forever lots of good wishes for a sweet and beautiful girl and your mother always with you i love you bottom of the heart janhvi️

Why indians speak english so hardly...

Who has made this unworthy anchor? How has this happened? Trying to copy Karan
&quot;If you like a guy come to us we will get you married ! &quot; True to every indian family ...

Its not good to comapre jhanvi and sara because both of them are working hard and gives there best...so better to admire any one of them whom you like the most..bt dont just cmpre them they both are best in their own fields...

<a href="">

<a href="">4:37</a> what he said?

Who&#39;s this chakka

The aishwarya segment at the end just stole the show!  God that woman just developed a sense of humour? Is there anything she can&#39;t dooo? 

Who&#39;s came here for vijay devarakonda

Anushka 
Very lovely

Very lovely

Tatiya means???

Where is the full video

Jhanvi look so innocent and cute. nice interview .

Vijay devarakonda fans hit hr
Tattiyans

Jhanvi Kapoor is just a kid....she is so beautiful

who leaves interviewers like these off their leash?  This character should be locked in a cupboard..eeww

What kind of voice is it?
Sonam and arjun is garbage of Bollywood

..love her&lt;3

Where did she say that she likes Vijay devarakonda???

Hit like for rowdy

she is so real

Don&#39;t Compare sara jahnvi The Both Very Good girls ND good Actress

I LOVE LAADLA. PURE FLAMES 
Chaalbaaz!!!
Jaanu cuteMissing ishaanLove frm Pak
Janvi Kapoor loves Vijay Devara Konda
Arreyy. Yeh bhai naam .kyaa heyy..Bahuth...Kamal seyy hasreyy hein eyy ।
Janvhi thinks a lot I think I think I think 

Upload full episode

She is the natural shadow of her mother and also she did a fantastic job in her debut film. DHADAK

Kjo is A Gemini 

This host is so irritating and is clearly not a great speaker. Where are the good talents? Talk show hosts are so cringe.

Jhanvi is Now doing interviews with a different energy. Totally copying Sara. Look at her interviews from her film promotions. She is probably feeling missed out .

Tattiyans

She is missing her mom

Janhvi Kapoor is so cute

I just found it difficult not to c jhanvi &amp;khushi shed 1 tear for their mother. While me and my sister did cry about Sridevi..

I like her but for some reason she seems to copy Sara Ali Khan now, seems she is trying to be cool n bubbly like Sara in her interview. Before, she used to be so calm composed in the way she talked.. now feels like she is trying to b mini Sara.

He is one of the worst interviewers ever. No tact to how the questions are asked or what words are used. Jumping from one subject to another. Just cringe worthy

Why are people losing minds comparing janhvi and sara they are friends Bollywood is big enough for both plus janhvi lost her mother  she&#39;s very vulnerable and as fans of her mom we should not bully her daughters and we all should be protective of janhvi her sister and their father  I don&#39;t know why  but janhvi seems very fragile to me  it could be I lost my mom at a very young age (5) she&#39;s was not sick or anything just like Sri mam and just like janhvi I had to be the big sister and mother figure to my baby sister (2yrs old) yes i was very young my self and I couldn&#39;t do much but I had to be strong for her . granted janhvi is not 5yrs old  and I wasn&#39;t rich like her but I still feel her pain

Love how she is getting more comfortable in the interviews and stuff... ️️️Way to go... I love Sara and Jahnvi and think that both of them have had different struggles and circumstances and u cannot compare them... 

WeStanQueen Janhvi  <a href="">#JanhviArmy</a>
Tatiyasss

I love sara .
Janvi is a very sweet and simple girl . very sure she will reach the same heights taht sridevi attained. LUV U JHANVI

She&#39;s very intelligent. I really admire that. I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;ll get lots of success ️

This interviewing dude is so annoying!!! What was the need of starting with her mom&#39;s dead?! That&#39;s a sensitive topic.

I like her voice
She is cute

He talks so annoyingly  gosh!

why most bollywood program&#39;s male host copy or behave like karan joher aunty ?

@<a href="">2:11</a>.. I just heard sridevi ma&#39;am voice ..anyone feel the same or just me!??

I love her voice 
She is so cute and funny

Lovely!

Average looking acting with below acting talented

love you Janvi
awesome janhvi I luv u

The way she presents herself, says why she is no where to the level to Sara!

I like janvi
Don&#39;t you anything important to do?Will ve not replying to all of you who are trained sheeps.....seems like you guys don&#39;t have the capacity to handle criticism.....Cheers

Very  nice

Can anyone say me what is her Shoe size ? Because I hear 52 and this is impossible

The host seems so conceited!

jahnvi is really sexier than any of the contemporary actress for sure.....

So irritating laugh of host plz don&#39;t fake ur laugh atleast

The comments are hilarious below. So many claiming to know this girl who is only on Camera. Good Luck to you Jhanvi!

Shame on you jhanvi tumne aapne maa ki laadla and judaii movie nhe dekhi just see these movies her acting is just fantastic in these movies

Was waiting for it for so long. This should&#39;ve been longer. Ask her for another interview please 

There is neither acting nor any face expression...it's just that Seidevi is Bonny Kapoor's daughter that is why she is being asked so much...she has undergone surgery at such a young age..
Jhanvi is so strong and confident. She didn&#39;t let Sridevi&#39;s death break her spirit. I am sure Sridevi would be very proud of her. May Jhanvi keep shining in Bollywood.

Jitesh Pillai 
soft and Honest girl,  I like her.

Don&#39;t use another surgery

Where can I find full episodes

I like jaanvi kapoor super style
Am i the only one or her laugh really sounds like Janice from friends? 

Where can I watch the full episode??

interviewer z like...amazingly interviewing
Trust me she is sooo strong

She&#39;s soo cute Love her...her laughter is soo beautiful and natural....go more shine Jhanvi️️

She is soo fun. Tattiyans .. u nailed it janhvi

She is sooo beautiful , innocent , cute and joyful

I cant listen her poor speech
Isn&#39;t she trying to do like Sara Ali Khan...

I like her voice
What is this obsession comparing Sara with jhanvi?

in this comment section...Riya Sen is soooooooooo jealous of Sara ..I don&#39;t know why?mujhe to hasi aa rhi h ki ye faltu k kaam actresses k liye ladna aur mean comments krna..simply watch, enjoy or admire...grow up man....

I love u 
Sara fans give like️
Love u janvi
Aww. She is super cute

I love her more than sara......she seems to be very innocent and sweet.....but with sara I think she fakes

Tatiyassssssssssssssssssssssssssss
damnn
Seriously?? Seriously? No talent. Nothing.Just a girl brought up in a rich family.People going all gaga over her!!And what has she achieved to be sitting there? These star kids are overrated.

so sweet

She is like normal person not looking like heroine

She is a super strong and sweet girl. Filled with lots of humility which most people lack today loads of love to jhanvi

Trying to be cute like sara..!!!

I lost my mum.....i know the pain

Nice conversation between both janvi kapoor looks stunning and gorgeous..

Tatiyaaass...
Jhanvi
Can feel a connection coz even I have lost my mom... n it takes time to get over it!

<b>that word  &quot;tattiyan&quot;</b> 

Sara  is  a good actress but Janvi is good actress plus a dream girl,like fairy tale.....this is my <a href="">perception.how</a> many of u agree with me

She should learn to handle interview from sara

GOD BLESS YOU  EVER JAHNVI

such a strong and cute girl

Who loves sara more than jhanvi

Well, there is no comparison between sara and Janvi. They both are good in there own way.

<a href="">5:01</a> About Anushkasharma
I love the way that the comment sections are filled with love nd gratitude towards Janu ... she is beyond words to tell how strong she is as a person hit like if u agree

She&#39;s such a sweet heart! .. Sara and jhanvi both are equally talented! Its just tgat Sara&#39;s more natural with her beauty than jhanvi! But in the end both look stunning 

sara will be biggest Star

Jahnvi is very pretty

Who gives a shit of this girl ..,where is Sara?

Too much plastic  n trying too hard to look like Kylie Jenner

Her voice very different her mom

I don't like it from any angle. In Bollywood, all the uncles, mothers, uncles and nephews are there...no one has the talent or creativity...this is why South films are coming out from Bollywood...to the talented people. There is no chance for this star kid...dhadak movie original sairat jesi bilkul nahi he...aur ha ye log etni had Tak gir gaye he ki bas remake hi kar rahe he vo chahe movie song...everything...Jo The person who likes you will also be your relative...
Happy new year janhvi.. ~~
I don&#39;t like jahnvi and Sara to be comparedJahnvi has an innocent charm around her... While Sara has an girl next door charm

Karen johar looks different in HD lol
She is cute!!

Shw forgt her mom....totally....

Over actress not beautiful

Jhanvi is so cute

Is this the full episode

The starting music is stolen from simply nailogical jeez

What does tattiyaas mean ?

I watche dadhakk and Janvi acting was  fabulous  &lt;3 :-* &lt;3 :-) she Will Be a Big Star One Day . . . its still unbelievable that sri devi is no More . . .

She&#39;s the best! Looking forward to seeing more of her movies

Jahnavi ur voice is terrific just like ur mom.. God bless

Tattiyaas hahahaha
Shit ni tatiyaan


Gosh the host’s voice is so fucking annoying

Why is every host becoming Karan Johar...

She will be super hit she acted really well i hv watch sara ali khan seriously she needs to take classes of acting

Woofffff!!! The interviewer. 

Jhanvi is cute n sara little mature

Aishwarya looks scary

Duck lips..

A very brave girl ️ You have spoken from the heart. Not from the PR team.
Tattiyaaaas  i am dead
Another Karan Johar copy in town 
She has so much innocence and joy. “Dil saaf” type️
She is not smart at all but so are millions of others!!

When did Saroj Khan start taking interviews?
Love you Janhvi 
Sorry to sayShe has a horrible voice.....i feel so embarrassed for her when she laughs

Happy new year

I like her!  Was extremely impressed by her acting in Dhadak. She&#39;s pure heated....we definitely need more interviews of her.

she seems very humble..and not very keen for opening up..she has an vulnerable nature..which kinda very sexy in women..

Jhanvi has lost lot of ground to Sara lately, she needs to work to remain in limeweight!!!

I love this girl so much. She is so real! She is not doing extra to people like her, she is just being herself.

I love u Janhvi. I am proud stan of urs n ur sooooo cute. Stay the same always️

Damn I am so excited for Aishwarya&#39;s episode.

She is really lovely man..

Damn wtf has happened to bollywoods beauty standards

Ds anchor tries to be Rajeev masand 

Who is this anchor he is so irritating

She is so adorable. She is herself not portraying. someone else .. lovely girl

Her smiling face so amazing
Cute 
Pause the video at <a href="">5:34</a> n how funny yet cute she&#39;s looking

I like Jahnvi and for her vocab and the way she handles herself. What’s up with the guy interviewing?? 

Good to hear her 

She has south Indian looks I wish she became more bigger star

For godsake stop comparing her with Sara...Sara carries her own personality and janhvi is different in her own way .....I feel so bad...her mother is not with her to tell her that don&#39;t think abt being trolled for no reason .....!! Get a life trollers !

Sara and Jhanvi are awesome in their own way I love them both Happy New Year

So Beautiful innocent and cute 

She is so natural and her voice is so cute

Janvi please keep up your good work and do  prove that you are Sridevi&#39;s daughter lots of love stay blessed happy healthy and strong

Sara ali khan k debut k baad jahnvi ko koi ni poochh rha..  sara stole all the limelight for all right reasons. She is soo real and down to earth person.

Beside sad for what she has gone through she is just not have brain at all.i don&#39;t think she will establish herself as actress.

She is so strong

I just loved her.....honest and pure soul..... You gooo girl the gen next ladysupetstar

Can’t wait for Aishwarya 

What an ugly galPoor indians, still servant of nepotismI am sure millions of great looking and great actot are being wasted in indiaShe is not even 1% of her momI am thinking what will happen to bollywood when all khans will disappearAlready 2018 has been disaster for all 3 khansDownfall for bollywood? What kind of actress are they injecting?

Firstly she doesn&#39;t know acting ,secondly she is launch due to NEPOTISM Thirdly sometime NEPOTISM launch good actors like SARA ALI KHAN,  Fourthly  this anchor look like TEDDY BEAR..

The interviewer is extremely irritating with his nagging tone...God !Can&#39;t stand him.

 love you
Why does the host remind me of Karan Johar ? 

Copied from South industry

The Vijay Devarakonda bit has been edited. It was present in the episode&#39;s teaser last week.

Loving one doesn&#39;t mean u have to hate other person. Sara and jhanvi are two different personalities. People should stop comparing both of them.

She is not GHANTA HEART THROB  of the Nation  Mr..TEDDY BEAR..

Janavi is beautiful cute and funny 
she&#39;s the most pure innocent girl.i Just love the way she talks and laughs. She gives me happiness always i see her. May Allah bless u and protect u.

Janhvi is very beautiful 

I love her voice..
jhanvi is very bombay girl.... she knows the slang of bombay... and typical bombay girl...

jitesh pillai is best

He talks like saroj khan

Sri device murdered and she smiling. ..so sad

Jahnvi is jaan ..I mean she's amazing
Is she virgin  ?

Listen to the funny and strange stories of this little girl.
I don&#39;t knw y....but I love her voice...
Aahhww I LOVE Janhvi!!! Soo cute What she said about anushka️

Sara Ali Khan is way better than her. Sara is Love.

Nice and true

Dumb anchor but goes well with her

What can I do if I don't want to sell Hindi?
Why can&#39;t people love both sara and janvhi? It&#39;s not like we have to hate janvhi to love sara..if you don&#39;t like janvhi, it&#39;s ok.. Not everyone has to like her.. But don&#39;t compare her with sara..



Paisa hindi films sy kamaty hain bollywood wali bancho interviews English
That guy is irritating

Who the fuck is this interviewer, the moron sounds like a freak

The phenomenon of nepotism…the mouth is like that of a mare.
Sara need to be on this show she will be so entertaining for sure

<a href="">2:11</a>  she actually sounds like Sri ma&#39;m 

<a href="">0:39</a> laugh?

Everytime she laughs and I&#39;m like is she crying ???

Who the fuck is this puppy?
Looks like Saroj Khan interviewing Sridevi

Sonam &quot;didi &quot; So cute of her 

You idiot, you don't even know how crazy you are about your mother's movies.
Janhvi u r so cute..
Btw what&#39;s the need of comapring sara and jhanvi.  Both are cute and good girls and have their own personalities.  Just learn to love people for what they are.  Everyone can&#39;t be same.

Sara is the best

Why Sara Ali khan fans are here? Sara n jhanvi are good in their own waysEdit: Thanks for the likes️

Why????? Whyyyyyyy this MAN on earth??????? ☻☻☻☻

I liked Aishwarya&#39;s interview promo at the end more than janhvi&#39;s...

Piece of CRAP!!!

I understand her pain this year my dad died  &amp; after 4 days later I give my <a href="">exam.My</a> family  was not with me I study  another country The pain was very terrible  no one was there for <a href="">me.My</a> result  came out pervious  week I am 4th in my class...Miss u <a href="">dad.Love</a> u.Thanks for all your advice &amp; support

Hey Englishman, please talk in Hindi also...this is Hindustani...
Love u jhanvi ️
Anchor sounds like GAY
Fake accent of this men..

Those who spend their time in looking for the faults in other, usally spend no time to correct their own..........no need to get affected by these bunch of loosers

Very beautifull girl. 

I love her️️
Is it necessary to make noise by giving intrvw on three channels? Hahaha.
Now a group will come to say that sara is better than janhvi. No matter who hates janhvi...i love her so much. I just admire this girl for being sooo strong even after facing a big loss in her life when she needed her mom most to make her proud with her first debut film. I admire her for controlling her tears and not shedding even one drop of tear before cameras and always presents herself happy. By the way she is also kind, humble, down to earth and extremely beautiful in and out. Love you janhvi

She admire Anushka, good choice

Who loves Janhvi ️️️? Hit like if you do.
Who is this asshole?

So cuteSo innocent So sweet voice love her

Sara ali khan️️ jhanvi? lol
East or west sara khan is the best.. RIP- Alia bhatt, janvi etc

<b>watch movie trailer reviews and much more</b> <a href="">#storytellerhindi</a>

The host reminds me of Saroj khan

If you like a boy, get him to us and we&#39;ll get him married to you. Just make sure he&#39;s not already married.
