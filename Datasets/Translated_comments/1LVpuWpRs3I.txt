Shambhu, sadhu, put it in your heart, and whenever you find it, you have it in your heart,
I roughly remember, in childhood i listened this song first time (around 2006-2007).Can Anyone confirm, Is it possible?

movie name
National bride entry song <a href="">0:03</a>

I heard this song before 5 years and still it is one of my favourite song 

2024 ????

Such precious baby

Dulha isi ke jaisa thaa kya jo rone lage enjoy karna thaa

This song is supposed to be a happy song, but there is no joy or merry feeling in her singing. No offence intended.

Ye song to accha he hi but Phillauri movie bhi underrated masterpiece he!!

When I was small that time I used to hear this song from that time I didn&#39;t get to hear  this  song , until I  became  a  teenager  now  I  hear  this song  I  always  become  very  happy 

Anyone in 2024 

this song should be declared as &#39; Anthem of bridal entry &#39;....in maarige,...........love to this song forever...like if i am true.....

I have heard this voice every day, I still feel this voice.
This is not a song.... This is an emotion and feelings of each girl &amp; boy with lot of dream  awesome song

This song remind me when I lost the love of my life..

Marriage season again ?

I found this song literally just literally. I try to find this song from many years.

Which movie song?

So a close friend of mine (yes he was more than my friend -,-) recommended this song to me and it became my favorite song. I had listen this song before he recommended it to me but his recommendation was special. I used to dream of making a bridal entry with this song at our weeding‚Äç. But the twist is that we have lost communication. IRONY. So every time I come back here, it brings back all of his memories. Anyway, I will still play this song at my wedding.<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/vQF1XpyaG_XG8gTs77bACQ"></a>

This song is an amazing compostion... When the song plays at a wedding party on those big speakers, when the bass hits.. oh god.. it sends chills down the spines.. and equally beautifully sung. People make fun saying this should not be played because it has been played so many times and has become a cliche.. but the fact is.. this song has that vibes and thats why it has become the anthem!

List of songs like this one, let&#39;s start commenting

Dude my parents start crying everytime they listen to this thinking I‚Äôll get married some dayEdit- my father passed away this year so I am never getting married, I can‚Äôt without him, he would say how he would have a breakdown if they played this on my wedding and now he is gone. Love your parents.Our indian families are not very verbally expressive, its more about acts of service and actions they do but please start saying things like ‚Äúi love you‚Äù and ‚Äúappreciate you‚Äù to your parents because you will be saying this once they are gone. Ô∏è

Dude,when my sister going to marry I  just cried so much , infact I can&#39;t able to handle my self but at the end I have to do Last rasam..........and this song played ........omg that day.......I can&#39;t forget our legend

one of the feb. song of mine

Respected Poonam Di, Johar, many congratulations for moving forward on the new path. It is said that the elder daughter is the smile of the house. The elder daughter does not go away, she cuts her parents into pieces and takes her away. Was busy, couldn't come. But, I have prayed for you. May there be moisture in your eyes, respect on your lips and monsoon rains in your lap. May Mahadev give you satisfaction, respect and continue to emotionally irrigate those parts of your hands which have departed with you. Your Abhishek

Brother seriously, on Friday I met a girl in the morning, we had a lot of eye contact but in the last few minutes I was not able to get away from Gaya or me. I have been crying since Friday, looking at his photo, whenever I remember him, listening to this song, I feel that Allah always keeps me happy that he will meet me someday inshallah 
This is a very peaceful song. I love it since I am a child. I mean whenever the bride arrives, the music, the words. A dream song for every Indian girl and for us (boys) as well.Would be a very emotional moment when it will happen in my life

This song played on my wedding entrance Ô∏è

i listened the song&#39;s tune in an ad and searched a lot then i got this song. you rock jasleen

When this song played I was sad by the moment of &quot;Vadhu Vidai Rasm&quot;. But on the other hand I was happy because my elder brother is getting a life partner &amp; I was getting a new family member.... Ô∏è

When ever I listen this song I get emotional

It&#39;s really sad the singers&#39; name is last.

My Masi went last year on 19th September was her birthday 

This seems to be happening to a boy, who is single, but has started looking at a girl, whom my friend or Jaan Pechan has fucked and is married somewhere else  Pity the boy, he must be in this wrong misconception.

<a href="">00:23</a>   <a href="">01:39</a> where the song starts

First time watching the video of this song i like it. But the more fun is in reading these comments

Others are her fan from Din shagna da,I&#39;m her fan since Panchhi ho jawa 

I was at a wedding for the first time I heard this song and came to know about Jasleen from that I am a diehard fan of her..

Everyone is talking about to play it in marriage ceremony, but I always listen to kill my depressionSo soothing voice

Well I am getting married in next 3 months...and this has to be one of those songs m gonna play for my princess 

<b>How many people suddenly remember and came here to listen </b>

My wedding entry song. 07/Dec/2021.

Best of bridal entry song 

Nice song
Everything is excellent in this song except that duck face.

Jasleen royal is just magic 

If DIN Shahana and London thumakada is not played on my wedding day i won&#39;t marry 

I really love song

Listen again and again never fill heart

First
Just a few weeks prior was my sister&#39;s shaadi :) words cannot describe how i felt when my appie walked down the path with this song playing and me holding her dress. When the song came to the part where the beat gets faster, i started crying so so much. The same appie who have always been like a second mother to me, raised me, took care of me, played all sorts of games, like cricket together with my other siblings. That same appie who still seemed so young to me, was now walking down the path about to be together with her husband for her entire lifetime. I cried so much its unbelievable. Now im sure they were happy tears. Appie, if youre somehow reading this, i love you so much.  Im so proud of you.And to everyone else who&#39;s read this comment all the way too the bottom, please enjoy time with your siblings. Cousins. Family. Even friends. :) You never know, one day you&#39;ll be playing with your little daughter, next thing you know there she is sitting on the sofa with her husband hand-in-hand in front of the banquet.  its truly an amazing and remarkable feeling. Alhamdulilah i got to feel it  Stay safe and stay happy everyone &lt;3333
