The professor was aprt of a great conspirancy plan

Professer and berlin mass

Professor

I saw a little that a police agent didn't know but got in season 4.
Hi Netflix. Can you tell me the song name of that remix of &quot;My Life Is Going On&quot;? You can hear it in this episode when Moscow is about to go through the front door.

Hi

Marseilli, Helsinki and Nairobi are the only members who will never do anything that might jeopardize the plans. They are so committed and so pure.

What if...?Gandhia v/s BARLIN

Professor and Berlin️

Don&#39;t be sad because it&#39;s over be happy because it happened - Berlin

I sad about Naibrobi, She&#39;s my one of the favorite character 

Also                 G.A.N.D.H.I.Ahas a separate fan base
Ohhhh  really nice

Sergio was a great professor

Berlin is my favourite character

whats the bg song playing after <a href="">1:10</a>

Professor all the way

What is this song called

Nerubi is my love from india

Without Tokyo and Rio, all the missions will be a lot easier. Too much drama

I want to be relax in my life like Berlin. The reason could have been his short  life span. 

Berlin outfits during the 2nd hiest was amazing. I was really impressed. He looked so handsome.

Plot twist professor is the hero

What is the music on the final minutes of the trailer?

<b>I will watch the advertisement after I finish the series </b>
The 2nd robbery is better than the 1st for the 1st  3/10  2nd 8/10

For Nairobi 
No one can beat this seriesAlways my no. 1 series

This is an official spoiler.

Berlin should not be dead ......without him money heist doesn&#39;t seem like money heist  I became fan of Berlin after only one season

Not as good as season 1 &amp; 2. It feels too unbelievable &amp; fake that they csn operate Nairobi lungs without any help. It takes 7 yrs to become a surgeon

The real heist is done by those people who watched this whole series without Netflix subscription 

Finally here after finished last season of this masterpiece

After watching season 4 only question that comes to my mind is what does GANDIA eats.

Just finished part 3, can&#39;t wait for part 4!!!!!

Am I not a part or not?
For oslo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi and Tokyo  they didn&#39;t deserve any of this tbh

Who want to see berlin as next JOKER

what&#39;s the name of the song playing in the background?anyone please

Berlin Nairobi 

Have fun 
I can’t believe this series end

This season was garbage, they are now trying to push show. Whole season one guy running in building and same useless dialogue but no proper actions.

One of my favorites web series after GOT

least revolutionary season

This season 5 is best

<a href="">0:01</a> this tune

Just finished the vol 2. I&#39;m just checking professor&#39;s clothes cause he didn&#39;t changed it from the beginning of the heist 

my favourite character is berlin

<a href="">1:50</a> idk but its so funny

Sometimes they wear protective vests, sometimes they don't, what's the point. Wear the protective vests all the time.
Please bring back Berlin️️
I love Berlin  He is amazing

If you want finish season 4 in one day, you are not a real heist fan.

From : Rollins with the heist of the centuryTo : Professor with the heist of the agesWe all grew up

For proffer 
The best combo professor and Berlin= ️

All of you who watch it in English, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. It&#39;s way better in Spanish.

Berline did very good acting....The only reason of seriousness in this movie is deu to Berlin acting

Plss release the next part of Raquel in bank of spain

Yes Berlin has separate fan base

Waiting for season 5

Season 4 is crap. The acting is the worst. U can anticipate everything. Etoro coming in the vault and u treat him like they don&#39;t know his agenda???  This is like a telenovela. Only kids would be like wow but everything they do is so predictable and stupid. I wish they had michael scolfied in their team lol. Oh my bad, they just need someone with common sense in the team. If a dumb guy like Etoro can manipulate them? Then money heist is crap.

What if spain govt. also decide Demonetisation after heist.

Only Berlin Others Wear Annoying Find It Overrated

If it was in india Modi would have demonetised all paper notes

Berlin 
Nairobi is now getting the love and appreciation(after season 4) that she deserved from season 1.️️I just love her

This serial was so annoying

If Indian Version Money Heist is made then according to me this cast will remain good.Note:- Cast may be different according to everyone, this is just a small opinion.Professor:- Ayushmann KhuranaBerlin:- Ali FazalTokyo:- Yami GautamRio:- Ishan khattarNai robi:- Tapsee pannuDenver:- Jim sarbhMoscow:- kumud mishraRaquel:- TabbuRaquel friend (Angel):- Vinay PathakGen. Dear:- K.K Menon, I have not found any idea of ​​reference for other characters too.
It made me feel so good that they got help from PAKISTAN 🇵🇰 

GANDIA , lesbon ️ one of the finest character in season 4. When he killed Nairobi, that was my favorite scene.Lesbon was not good to see dumped in season 4. that&#39;s not fair justice

Pakistanis are no doubt very genius  🇵🇰
10 of 10 IMDB Rating .... Awesome web series&#39;s

Professor is one of the useless people in this series.. He has no guts to take decisions at crucial time.. Only Berlin is best.. He should have lead this all from outside..

This Tokyo is very irritating 

After seeing all season of money heist I think this Tokyo is stupid, brainless and asshole

Denver lifting gold bar weighing 10 kg (probably) with two fingers

Nice

part 5

Please dear and main professor ko hi jitàaanàa
Op

Season 5 please 

Waiting Season 5 

U shacked the World in Corona

There is always a possibility that professor is knowingly doing this show by which he can be good public figure(cult) which will help professor in this WAR

Sanju tune refrain jaisa nahi h
I started 1 season I am on 5 th episode 

Wow osm... Movie

Does anyone know about seasion 5?

Did the youtube ad just fooled me by making me download season 4 again, its season 5 which we are waiting for...

The Professor :-  I m the most intelligent.Michael Scofield :- laughing in Denver&#39;s voice  only Prison break fans will get it

I personally like&quot;  marsella&#39;s character , - he speaks multiple languages , - know how to drive military helicopter , -professional thief , -ex special force comando , -animal lovers - and  bad ass , kick ass guy

I think The Professor Will Be Forced To Mislead His Group Season 4 ended with Alicia Sierra tracking down the professor and holding a gun to his head. No one is sure what the next move is here as Sierra is an extremely vindictive woman, furious about the way the events of the heist have gone., Alicia Is Faking Her Pregnancy It is clear that Sierra is not a compassionate person. In fact, this character often comes off as a psychopath as she ruthlessly tortures, interrogates, and attacks the gang. Still, it seems clear that Sierra at least cared about her husband. While Alicia seems to be pregnant, she does not take any of the precautions that pregnant mothers typically take. She is often shown smoking, drinking coffee, and eating candy., Alicia Joins The Gang, Sierra does not like to be pushed around or mistreated. While she was dedicated to taking down The Professor and his team, this was purely as it was her job and has nothing to do with what Alicia feels is &quot;right.&quot; When information about the torture Rio experienced was released, Alicia was pressured into taking personal responsibility to save the perception of the government., Tatiana Will Help The Police, In the flashbacks to the time where the Bank of Spain heist was being planned, Berlin is celebrating his wedding with a woman named Tatiana. Berlin has shared information about the plan with Tatiana and The Professor continuously warns him about how dangerous this is. It seems clear that Tatiana will come into play in the present but she has not yet appeared., Tatiana Will Save The Professor, If Tatiana doesn&#39;t come forward to help the police, then perhaps she will come forward to help The Professor. Sergio likely would have considered this loose end and although we haven&#39;t seen her yet, it is possible that Tatiana is somehow involved with the plan. With The Professor currently in a precarious situation, it is possible Tatiana will emerge to save the day. Tatiana And Alicia Are Related, There is a striking resemblance between Tatiana and Alicia. The two also seem to have similar attitudes and mannerisms. This has caused many to believe that the two are one and the same. , The Gang Will Fire Gold Nuggets Into The Crowd To Escape, Nairobi was in charge of the gold in the heist. Under her guidance, gold bars were melted into golden nuggets. While fans originally assumed this was to make it easier to carry the gold out, there are several clues that imply there may be something else going on here. Firstly, this heist is about getting Rio back, not making a profit. Secondly, The Professor said to the group that they would not get out without the gold.

Top best actOr After Professor is berlin 
The First heist was rly good (part 1&amp;2)Part 3&amp;4 are dumbest heist movie, because when you have secret information, their country will be suffender instantly. And shooting gandia rly close so fckin bad 

Just imagining if professor play joker role 

<b>Berlin</b>
Professor, you doing great work...
Part 5 please....

Just Imagine Nairobi In 5th Season ️

What is the song on <a href="">1:09</a>?

I don&#39;t why season 4 is criticized so much, imo this was one of the best seasons. the whole series is more than just a robbery. I think it deserved at least 9.0 rating on the IMDB..........

When will it come in Dark Hindi language?

Please reply?

All those dislikes are from Arturitos fake accounts ...

BERLIN WAS IN HIS OWN WORLD

Who is here after Naveen polishetty vedio

Dying to see season 6

Berlin Best character ️
Dude you gotta love the operatic part of the trailer it just gives goosebumps

The cryptocurrency has charted a 10-fold rally in the past 11 months, offering a significantly higher return than gold amid the massive inflation-boosting monetary and fiscal stimulus delivered by authorities worldwide to counter the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown. The precious metal reached a record high of $56.000 in February 2021 and has been trending higher ever since. I invested 6BTC and I have been earning 2BTC weekly..

The Tokyo’s narrator voice i think she just telling the judges about the heist because all of them got caught in the end.

my most favourite series, i&#39;m waiting for part 5

Waiting for part 5....

Who is watching in feb 2021 just like it

Wonderful series I have ever seen 1 of the most powerful series with full drama , breathtaking , you will not loose a concentration even for a single second . A chess player (professor ) played well . I think he used his 99./. Brain for a heist ... and plan went well with a success .. totally reccommend go for it ...

the show was  not stressful until season 3. it&#39;s now more interesting SI ?

I know &#39;em as Red Criminals

Hindi Pee bHi Dhayan Dee Dee Thoda Saaa
Ok, i&#39;m waiting for <b>trailer season 5</b> now

first 2 seasons were amazing, but the 4 one is so garbage, its really hard to watch when the head of security(assasin) can actually outrun 5 rifles and dodge thousands of bullets and get out without a single scratch, lazy writing, and its a money grab at this point, nothing more, litterally just watched cuz of berlins flashbacks and denver, tokyo is so annoying i have to skip all scenes with her..

One of the best series I watched till date

nobody:denver: ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Yea Series hindi dubbed hota to bohot accha hota 
MH 5 trailer??

Song name please

Who&#39;s here wating for Season 5?

That Security Guard needs to be Tortured in Season 5. If he escapes again I&#39;m gonna go to the Bank of Spain to hunt him down myself

Worst season of Money Heist. It started great until the whole show and narrative turns into a goose chase for one man and ends up completely ignoring the main plot. A lot of plot holes halfway through. Very disappointing.

Professor gets worried and cared for his men and women more than the Generals at WW2

When are we getting Part 5

This trailer is Bomb  It&#39;s gives high

can anyone tell me the title of the background music/song in <a href="">1:09</a> hahahaha

Hey,We all know that Berlin , Moscow , Denver , and the Professor are the BEST!!

Aurtro will be the secret
Am i the only one who never watched it?

Rip to nairobi

Special 26 is way better. .

ShhhhhhhhhhhAVANTA !!!!!

Watching it again after finishing whole series for 4th time.

Everyone hates Artoro . And that is called art .bcz the making + acting of the character is so beautiful because it touches the ️

Can we please just call it La Casa de papel, not money heist... the title money heist sounds like a 4th grader came up with the title...

O beautiful chao beautiful chao beautiful chao ️
This is an unpopular opinion because I&#39;ve only just watched a few episodes of part 4.....But can we add stockhome to the club of most annoying characters along with honorable members tokyo , rio palermo and the chair person Arturito?

I think money heist should end

Dubb In Hindi.....

Love From  India , Kerala

I just watched Breaking Bad and Money Heist in succession. And now, I feel like concocting something evil... Before anything else, though, I must have a theme song (something like Bella Ciao or Heisenberg&#39;s song). Hahaha.

What if the entire series is a dream of Tokyo and she is telling this story to her friends who are the characters of the show

BEST SERIES EVER

This is just masterpiece

BAD NEWS There is no S5 bcoz the season SD due to no budget bcoz of C19!

I m Crazy fan of berlin  Any crazy fan of berlin like me

Wht would happen if thomas shelby professor and light yagami became friends

I get goosebumps every time I watch this trailer

I can't wait for season five!!!!!
This heist is useless in india because our government will ban the currency   and suddenly your money is invalid after the heist

Breaking bad or money heist

What is this music in this trailer someone tell me please!

Gandiya Is A Real Bitch
Why nobody is talking about Palermo ️

Any Indian fans?

Please release season 5 fans are waiting for that as soon as possible release season 5

Please come back with season 5 of money heist and release season 5 as soon as possible

PLEASE DONT STOP MONEY HEIST HUHUHU

PLEASE BACK NAIROBI

Njan preset alight motion vedios ittittund please support me

Why not just take plate money

Alicia going to be dead 

By the concept of this show, we should all praise Osama Bin Laden, because he became the resistance to big government.I mean imagine if Mahata Gandhi, MLK, and Nelson Mandala have stolen the money from their OWN countries&#39; tax dollars and lived a life in some other country with all the luxury.Seriously: we should be careful whom we consider our role models.

I think Arturo and gandia are the most hated characters

I f@cking hate 1 thing about this show: (and it&#39;s my biggest problem with most good shows even)They sometimes let dumb sh!t happen just to make it &quot;interesting&quot;, or to move the show along.Other than that...great show!

we are doing a time heist, but not from the government, from the AUDIENCE.we will fill the show with all the melodrama and backstories to stretch it as long as possible. Also, we are the resistance, but we are also capitalist, we will steal the money, won&#39;t pay any tax to people, and use tax money from the general public to run our operation, and still, we will keep all the money for ourselves and won&#39;t do anything to change the system.

Don&#39;t steal El professor from us .

I didn&#39;t watch one episode , all my frnds rqstd to watch money heiest series, but I request to my frnds how to robber ATM

Why this is not in hindi

We want in hindi  
I love this comment section

Does anybody know the title of that kinda “religious” song in the background? Haha

What&#39;s the melody playing in the back ?? Please let me know

Luv from Tamilnadu

Hindi Release Date?

Don&#39;t watch &quot;Money Heist&quot; otherwise you will get a lot of stress. The story and characters goes in to your mind️.

Good one but many scene are unrealistic

Last night I had a dream where I saw professor dead :(

Tbh I was wishing there was a follow up on Alison Parker

I just watched season 4 before coming here, and thank God I haven&#39;t seen this before finishing the series gahhhh the spoilers :((( it was more frightening to see Gandia break free and enter the panic room without knowing it first

I miss Nairobi so much 
Money heist? Really? Why does americans always change movies and series that&#39;s originally in other languages? Is it really that hard to read subtitles sometimes?

Watching all seasons and then I searched it in YouTube to find trailer wow ️

Why can’t I find it on Netflix

Everything is fine and look realy perfect in money heist all season except the three things that 1) Pakistan have internet 2) Pakistan have surgeon 3) Pakistan have hackers  even tho Pakistan have hackers first thing the gonna do is crack there neighbor&#39;s WiFi ,which don&#39;t have internet connection 

Aurtoro must be the professor&#39;s trump card from the very first heist that&#39;s why professor entered him in the building in second heist 

The amount of love and respect I have in my mind for Berlin and the amount of hate I have for Tokyo is the same (Infinite).

I just can&#39;t stand watching Tokyo&#39;s face. Whenever I see her I feel furious and that treatment she gave to Berlin comes into my mind. I just want her dead.

Some say Professor is the best, Some say Berlin is the best but deep down we all know TOKYO IS A STUPID FUCKIN BITCH.

Most irritating character tokyo
If Calmness is an art, BERLIN is Picasso of it

Cikibum.. cikibum

The term Latin derives from Latin due to its language and customs. A language that was very important for many centuries, but is no longer spoken today. We are Latin because their current languages ​​derive from Latin: the Portuguese, the Italians, the French, the Spanish, etc., ... but all the countries in America whose mother tongue is Castilian/Spanish are Hispanic countries (a Latin word to name Spain/Hispania), in no case Latin, since it has nothing to do with the rest of the languages ​​derived from Latin, therefore they are Hispanic and Latin America.
The English created the term Latin America in order to divide the power that brought together all the Hispanic countries under a single kingdom, a single flag and a single unity and promoted the division of all brother countries, blood of our blood, with the black legend about Spain, (unscrupulous and bloodthirsty colonizers and even today, this is how they tell their story), when real history is exactly the opposite. If we had not defeated the English again and again, today English would be spoken throughout Latin America and few native natives would remain, since they, pure genocidaires, never mixed with the Indian. For them the best Indian was and is the dead Indian. This is the true history of English imperialism, cynics and hypocrites, which generation after generation have been hiding without writing the real History, but the one that interested them and interests them.
Edict of Queen Isabel: And do not allow or allow the Indians to receive any wrong in their persons or property, but order that they be well and fairly treated and if they have received any wrong, they remedy it.
This is the last will that Queen Isabella the Catholic addressed to her subjects in her will. This is undoubtedly a desire that clashes with the cruel image that the black legend has spread of the Spanish Empire throughout the world. We have known for a long time who spread this legend, the perfidious Albion, who, as Blas de Lezo said: Every good Spaniard must always PISS while looking at England.
Most of the time it felt like I&#39;m watching Indian drama serial of star plus like what the hell are you doing with your hostages.

If they aren&#39;t killing arturito in season 5 I guess I&#39;ll have to visit Spain.

BINOD

Money heist? I&#39;ve only ever heard the original name. I bet the Americans watch it with some dubbed English audio too

Arturito irritates me more than Joffrey Lannister.

<a href="">1:13</a> The Man, The Myth, The Legend. The Professor that the world needs.

Am I the only one who finished the entire 4 season without even watching the trailer? 

:No one? OK. just me.
