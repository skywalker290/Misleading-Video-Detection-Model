what gender burger baby is

<a href="">7:37</a> that probably is a lie lol

<a href="">12:15</a> but Poods, I never even tried because I can see with my eyes that my pee-pee is too wide for the disc hole.

I will not try a life with you.

<a href="">2:37</a> &quot;He had met his other half&quot; THIS PHOTO IS ON A REAL AD IN A SUBWAY STATION IN  MY CITY!!!I don&#39;t remember what it was for. I feel like it said something similar to &quot;advertising they won&#39;t forget&quot; as the caption. If anybody actually gives a shit, I&#39;ll go back there and check if it&#39;s still there and edit this to say what its an ad for but otherwise just know that it happened.

<a href="">5:04</a>AOC

Just realized that Pewds PP is dirty.

Why the freekin knees? I LOVE HIM say that

<a href="">5:26</a> what french people use as weapons

„They are explaining what’s on the photo for people that are blind”But how tf are they suppose to read the text?

The original cursed images

You heard it here first, pewds said he’d frick a blob fish

If people are blind they cannot read it

Membership in a lion or the internet and the

im here because im sad and my anxiety wont let me sleep

Imagine having 5 cameras on one phone… at that point I would just get a regular camera

I don&#39;t know why but for some reason knowing that my phone has the same amount of cameras as Felix&#39;s phone makes me very happy.

Damn Felix, doing an ad just before I get an ad, ass.

So if crackers don’t belong in the fridge but chocolate does, what about a chocolate coated cracker. Checkmate.

Blobfish are actually really cute little fish when they haven&#39;t been decompressed from their very deep dark down under home. They look like that gelatinous blob because their flesh basically explodes and puffs up when it&#39;s taken out of the very high pressure environment it lives in. And they&#39;re way cuter than sunfish.

&quot;Will Pharrell&quot;

I had a fan blowIng in my eyesand I still didn&#39;t blink

Can someone explain the felix has no legs meme?

Cat snake, cake, snat...
<a href="">5:46</a> hey i saw that one on an exurbia video

creating stock photos is super easy, just own a nice camera and get yourself a bunch of psychedelic drugs

<a href="">3:39</a>, Pewd’s turns into the joker.

<a href="">15:26</a> Yes you have a purpose, you have a reason. Keep going Pewds (rewatching a few of Pewds vids, I know Im almost two years late here, sorry)

was he ok in this video lol

<a href="">15:09</a> Is that Jeremiah from Donut media?! I NEED ANSWERS!

Ah yes the famous office cast member , Will Ferrell

The thing that he used to use light mode haunts me

roasting the sponsor phone for too many camera

Well the reason they are cool is cause of how bad they look well atleast for me it’s just funny seeing a human smiling weirdly and someone dragging the human with a mouse maybe it’s just me I think it’s just me :(

If they are blind they cannot read the description

<a href="">5:27</a> guy says, Ay Yi Yi!!!

<a href="">6:00</a> I can in fact agree that that is Cringe!

<a href="">11:05</a> &quot;Hello Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, here&#39;s your pizza.&quot;
Pewds is bad at sponsoring it feels like he is doing that just for money and insinuating us to not buy it

Samsung better puh pathetic
Pewds:&quot;thanks for describing the image to people that are blind &quot;* But blind cant read *

Why so many dislikes lol

Let&#39;s not focus on the hot dogs but his face one eye is farther from the nose and lower down and one is right on the nose and higher up and it&#39;s also slanted

Love you pewdiepie

i want stock photos to be the last remaining evidence of human existence.

A 100mil youtuber saying , more cameras means better phone , is soo sad

&quot;nice&quot;

That guy woke up, maybe exercised, maybe made his bed, showered, made breakfast, made his coffee, drove into the studio, met up with his coworkers, talked about the plans for the shoot that day, then took his shirt off and layed his face in a cake. We&#39;re living in a society.

schogetten whole milk

Chocolate does not belong in the fridge, you monster. Obviously you don&#39;t understand the connection between temperature and flavor profile.

How do you live in the uk and not know who David Tennant is ?

THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO GOOGLE DAVID IS JUST KILLING ME 
I’m tired of these political ads. I keep getting them and I’m not even legally allowed to vote.

Every time felix does ads I feel cringe to my bones.

<a href="">6:05</a> is straight facts... Don&#39;t come at me, you can&#39;t change my mind!

Just watching this video right after a mental breakdown.... wonderful

GEnuine question, of the literall 100 million of you, does anyone actually have an honor pro? I&#39;m considering the idea of a new phone, since the one i have is 5 years old and I could use an upgrade.

Im a simple man. I see a huawei phone, I like.
Japanese commercials are just stock images as ads.

chocolate belongs in the pantry. The freezer is too cold for cocoa butter

Did just you call David Tennant a c list celebrity?

These photos makes no sense!
Is it just me or is lazarbeams video the exact same as this one?

I even enjoy pewds doing ads, wth

i tried not to blink after a while my eyes started watering. Welp i guess i suck my pp through ham \:

Burger has no gender because burger is gender

Literally got an ad for a stock photo company in this video  :/

Chocolate does belong in the fridge. It weirds me out when my bf just leaves his out....but he also does this with drinks. He&#39;ll take one sip, sit it on the counter and walk off for hours... I cannot explain how much this boggles me.

<a href="">06:14</a> <b>Ilie&#39;s vlogs kicks in</b>

<a href="">12:13</a> No Felix. The disk receiver is too small for mine!

<a href="">5:04</a> Give me Hungry Eyes 
Blob fish actually look normal in their natural environment and they haves scales; they live very deep down in the ocean and the pressure is too much when they’re brought to the surface they pretty much implode and their skin is ripped off

That Office episode where Will Ferrell.....also known as Steve Carrell....shouts at the cake XD

<a href="">2:50</a> why does that trigger my trypophobia

<a href="">3:35</a>

&quot;why are all the kids blonde?&quot; they are swedish.

Got an ad for &quot; Adobe Stock &quot; during this vid.

Vic media PewDiePie goes insane after eating salad
Pewds says keeping biscuits in the fridge is weirdHe later says it&#39;s weird to not keep chocolate in the fridgeMe sensing the obvious loop hole.But what about chocolate biscuits.

<b>zuko losses his phone</b>Zuko: I have to find my HONOR

wait he said he never heard back from william osman why wouldnt he do respond i would have really liked to see him do it

Pewdiepie gets sponsored by honor later uses a samsung

The phone would be perfect for detectives.(Taking really zoomed in photos from a far way away)

&quot;Thanks for describing the image for the people that are blind&quot;What

I agree that chocolate belongs in fridge

What is wrong with his wrists?? <a href="">0:00</a>

My salad taste funny.
fun fact the photo where the orange haired girl hugs the creature is an actual art piece in Australia in this small exhibition. we went there and there was a lot weirder stuff

His laugh sounds like bob the tomato and Alfred from the league of incredible vegetables

The add sounded like an old tv commercial

Hey pewds my 3ds has 3 cameras and 2 of em are used to take 3D photosQuality is shit tho

<a href="">10:09</a> I pee through my pants every night as I sleep<a href="">4:09</a> <b>NOT</b> <a href="">10:09</a> SORRY I WAS HIGH

<a href="">15:00</a> if we get to speculate that can we speculate that marzia and you have baby soon

<a href="">2:36</a>

I&#39;m sorry, but David Tennant is not a B-C list celebrity. He&#39;s a damn national treasure. Did you seriously have to google David Tennant to see who he was? Somebody call the cancel police.

<a href="">13:12</a> Did Felix just call David Tenant a B or C list actor? …oof

Pewds: READS a description Also pewds: so blind ppl know what’s happening

I didn’t blink
I just saw the weirdest ad ever

“Thanks for describing the image for people who are blind.”Hold up...

yes felix, i too, a waman, have stuck my peepee within a dvd ejector

<a href="">3:22</a> if you see closely you can see a wamen who pearced a leaf with a spoon

BURGER BABY

The chicken thing is pretty common with fighting chickens that to refresh them kinda thing

I’m not laughing bc the salad tells me jokes, I’m laughing at my poor one time attempt at being healthy

&quot;thanks for describing the image for people that are blind.&quot; then how they see the description.

I AGREE CHOCOLATE BELONGS IN FRIDGE

Felix: Thanks for describing the image for blind people!Yes of course but.......if they can&#39;t see the image, how should they read the description?

No, Felix, I do not want your garbage phone.

ur copying lazarbeam, he did this 2 years ago, the pictures are the exact same

<a href="">2:05</a> i guess maths was&#39;nt your strong subject i school

Ugh this salad tastes like nothing 

<a href="">11:00</a> Pog champ man
It&#39;s gender is burger
The kid putting bologna in the computer is actually believable. My daughter shoved a bunk of cookies in mine.

&quot;30x digital zoom, now you can finally see pp&quot;

When u said just blink I did my best not to blink.  Then I remembered I don&#39;t have pp

Pewdiepie speak Swedish like you did with Xrose
<b>Yes</b>

30x zoom “now you can finally see peepee!”

legit , halfway through this video I got an advert for stock footage.

I&#39;m an Indonesian and It is pretty common too in my place that we spit herbal to a Cock before it fight

Pause ur vid at <a href="">9:24</a> and look at one of the Reddit’s...

Hahaha got pokemon go and after the vid

First of all,The burger baby gender is beefSecond if the woman&#39;s banquette is a gun the the grocery store has more gun than an actual gun shop, like pies and croissants! You think that a banquette gun is threatening against a grosser store?

<b>Title:</b> Stock Images needs to be Stopped!<b>Pewds right into the video:</b> &quot;Stock photos is a national treasure. Stock photos need to be preserved at all costs.&quot;

A funny thing is that i got an ad from Adobe Stock Photos

If pewds recorded his footage with his honor 20 pro, we would have waaaaaaaaay better video.

chocolate belongs in frige  d  (i didnt know where the d went so I left it on the side)

I mean, robbing the bakery with a baguette. She&#39;s really bringing home the Dough..

Getting hit with a baguette would be pretty painful.

Chocolate does not belong in the fridge.

i&#39;m gonna buy a honor phone.BUT NOT THAT ONE YIKES YOUR ADVERTISING DOESNT WORK

Now Cocomelon&#39;s &quot;wash your knees&quot; make sense

quarantine is very very very boring i hate this

Excellent advice!! I count myself to be successful in stock trading because of the amazing strategy of Mr Samuel Raphael

Did you know that the blob fish we see in most pictures are of them after they literally throw up their organs and lose their pigment. Ya

Pewds scream at the blobfish was too funny and too cute 

Will Furrell?  That&#39;s Steve Carell.  And it&#39;s Ferrell.  But also good vid.

i thought that the iphone was so fricking ugly with all the cameras buthonestlythe honor phone thing organized the cameras to where they make the phone look a bit bettergg

Felix, you missed the opportunity to say that if you get shot with a baguette he would be in &quot;pain&quot; because &quot;pain&quot; is bread in french and baguettes are french.

felix: &quot;I know we&#39;ve all put our peepee through there, don&#39;t say yes just blink&quot; me: <b>blinks</b>           &quot;but I don&#39;t have a peepee&quot;<b><i>confused screaming</i></b>

I just got a 7 minute unskipible ads abt earbuds nj

<a href="">12:15</a> I didnt blink until the end

<a href="">6:05</a> I paused it before he said chocolate in the fridge 3 times and left the video so now I keep my chocolate in the oven

Chocolate is better cold....but American chocolate is nothing compared to Belgium chocolate....so I&#39;m sure most people just think all chocolate taste like Hershey&#39;s lol

Ok I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late to comment but.. I cant help but notice. Look at the teeth in the eye stock photo. Now look at the bottom row of teeth carefully. I think I just discovered I have a tooth phobia. There are too many teeth, and I&#39;m frightened.  (Ps, sorry person who&#39;s teeth those are.)

Love how he thinks of original content, just chooses not to make it.<a href="">11:49</a>

I love how sive had to add his own voice to the message because Pewds probably mispronounced it<a href="">7:53</a>

Did you just call David Tenant a B/C list Celebrity? If those Dr Who fans could hear they would be very upset

If you send wierd stock photos to a completely random someone without context then he or she might be questioning ther life and why.

my phone has 6 cameras 2 on front 4 on back

<a href="">0:46</a>How many forehead lines this guy got?

<a href="">5:27</a> well, im not there so its the yeast of my problem

Pewdiepie: “thanks for describing the image for blind people”                              Me: <b>arabic Nokia ringtone noises</b>

He should understand if he is advertising a phone with good cameras he should probably not be using a bad camera that makes him look fuzzy. Swedish boi isn&#39;t aloud to advertise cameras because as we all know he has a terrible one. Smh

Chokolate In the fridge. Nooooo 8t its to be eaten or hidden. What next bread and cereal im fridge?

Typed out discription for blind peopleI did it boss

<a href="">12:02</a> why is that inappropriate ??

i dont like choclate
I feel like it isn&#39;t really photography if its full of obnoxious edits. People looking for stock photography don&#39;t want it to be already edited into oblivion. Maybe people are using stock photo websites as photoshop portfolios

&quot;Thanks for typing the description of the image for people that are blind&quot;

the old white dude with the rock about to kill himself is the opposite of the obama meme

I’m Vietnamese, about that Asian woman spitting on a chicken I can confirm that isn’t true, wasn’t sure what she was doing...

Pewdiepie trynna sell us a communist state owned huawei phone during a pandemic caused by China.Seriously??

What are the genders of a hamburger thanks Felix now I can&#39;t sleep I need answers

Bold of you to assume I wear pants.

Remember lazarbeam did these, I’m not saying that pewds copied him, but just that he did them at one point

So why did I watched thisss...

As an Arizonan, I was genuinely puzzled as to why he would say that &quot;chocolate belongs in the fridge&quot; and it took me a minute figure out why  because I didn&#39;t think that could belong anywhere else without melting

FINNALY SOME ONE ELSE THAT PUTS CHOCOLATE IN THE FRIDGE OMG!!!

Why does he pronounce purpose like herpes

<a href="">4:23</a> When u need an dongle for your memory

Pewds: Thanks for discribing these fot the blind people The blind people who can&#39;t read the description: <b>non-visible confusion</b>

Also pew puts an ad in so 3 seconds after it finishes Youtube puts another one in. Cheers guys...

Betrayd pewds would abuse the brofist for an add.

when pewdiepie&#39;s videos has ads in them

WOULD YOU BUY THAT CELLPHONE FELIX!?!?!?

He said wil carrel

CHOCOLATE BELONGS IN THE FREEZER!

so why don’t you shoot your videos w your phone?

Isn&#39;t it abacus and not abacus? :o

You can never have too many potatoes!

Pewds tried to force me to blink, haven&#39;t blinked in a month

I got a stock image ad for this video.

Even if it wasn&#39;t David Tennant... the Doctor Who references were gold and everyone agreed on Doctor who being the theme...

How could you say the phone is holo i thought you knew better

Because blind people would have been able to read it

Felix: thanks for desgribing the image for the people that are blind.Blind people: Can&#39;t see the desciption.

Shutterstock is just a parody of 5 minute craft’s thumbnails.

Dumping the disabled woman into the pool is an old joke.  He asks her why she&#39;s crying, and she says she&#39;s never been kissed.  So he kisses her, and then she&#39;s still sad because she&#39;s never been fucked.  So he throws her in the pool and says &quot;Now you&#39;re fucked&quot;.

<a href="">3:39</a> quarantine has driven pewdiepie insane
i know salad

what about this boy

the crocodile in office is probably for a sexual harassment theme

<a href="">12:44</a> Vsauce, Strawberry here

I have seen this so many times.And I finally just realize that on PewDiePie said the stock image was the same title in case people are blind if they’re blind they can’t read though

I  put my chocolate in the freezer...

<a href="">3:26</a> i have a whole 250 page google doc of people smiling while eating salad

I read somewhere that if you create enough stock photos then you get to have access to a bunch of programs that would previously cost a lot of money, I considered doing it

is aaa ??? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  i dont know <a href="">13:25</a>
the describing&#39;s good, but how can blind people read? no offence, just curious

Pews, I’m not trying to be cynical but the phone looks like a chinese version of a new Samsung phone lol

Pewds: <a href="">12:18</a>Me with my face tics: :O

Apparently, blob fishes are real but they appear different when they are still deep underwater.Their appearance changes since their body is so used in crushing pressures that when they resurface their body literally inflates and turns into a hideous looking creature.If you wanna know more about it im sure theres a video about it on YouTube.

Felix: Who would use these?Also Felix: *Gets paid to review the same stock images

the people taking the photos must be paid for every photo they upload..so they take heaps of random stuff

Stock photos are like my memory&#39;s some are good some are bad but all of them will be memes one day

Pewds is the best at advertising things

Ha pewds I closed 1 eye then the other. Not blinking

I got an ad for Adobe Stock

Imaging just hearing Felix yelling and laughing furiously saying “I’M EATING SALAD!”

Me watching this with the iPhone 11 Pro thinking yea pro is better

<a href="">2:20</a> blind people can&#39;t read!!

what was that phone ad?

He found cat snake.

I found a mobile with 7 cameras. ️

<a href="">12:23</a> wtf Pewds, my eyes was forcing me to blink and i blinked at the same time as the cam

poor blowfish he&#39;s normal in natural habitat but ridiculed when out sucked into the world and changed completely just like me

<a href="">11:51</a> - <a href="">11:56</a>   It’s already done you can go back to rewind 2018 and stop the video at any second and you will get what you asked for

They cant make it something simple. It has to be &quot;Cat blows up half of a bowling ball with a purple grenade launcher while doing the orange justice dance in front of four Native American door salesmen.&quot;

Did he call Steve Carell will Ferrell????¿

<a href="">3:19</a> never thought i&#39;d see someone go mentally insane over salad

<a href="">12:19</a> i did not blink
<a href="">2:27</a>. When blind people can read

i havent blinked for 3 days. thanks felix

That person holding a blobfish is an actual sculpture called Eulogy by Patricia Piccinini-- i was making fun of it with my friend at the gallery last year, so it&#39;s strange to see it come up again watching Pewdiepie videos haha

after this i never blinked again

You may be laughing but I&#39;m 1000% sure a sizable portion of these companies&#39; income is from people who buy these pictures to make memes with. They do it in purpose.

The Joker.

look up Florida man and your birthday things like alligators attacking office workers happen regularly in Florida.

You have to sub to pew You have to sub to pew You have to sub to pew I said it three time now you have to sub to him

I didn’t see any Harold ️

But lazarbeam did this first

This is your wife who died in the car wreck with our son. It is not our sons fault that we died. It was cursed on us from Jessica, Dave, Marzia, Ali. Marzia cheated on you with Jack, and Mr. Beast. Your editor killed you and Marzia and Mr. Beast helped hide your body.

Marzia is evil you need to get away from her.

She is working with Dave to keep us apart.

You have to get rid of Marzia

Pewds: hey look it’s vsauce My brain: heh... apple sauce

I got 6 Adobe Stock ads on this video

<a href="">2:26</a>  “thank you for describing the image for people who can’t see” it’s pointless they still can’t see

I&#39;ve just realised stock photos have to be an scp, this couldn&#39;t happen except through anomalous means

Anyone else get an ad for stock photos lol

Snake with a catshead? no

as you can clearly see, pewds is faking the excitement about the phone

LONG FUBBY. MAKE PLZ

Hi ifroom sody arapy

1/3rd of this video was an ad for honor 20 pro. And it pissed me off

“How many cameras does your phone have?” Me, who doesn’t have a phone because of my overprotective mother, when I’m 15, “zero.”

<a href="">3:39</a>JOKER????

Chocolate does not belong in the fridge unless you plan on letting it warm up for 20 minutes or so before eating it or the weather is very warm. Chocolate should be consumed at room temperature, that is to say around 18-22C degrees, because the closer it gets to its melting point, which is roughly the temperature of the inside of your mouth, the more flavour notes can be detected. In other words cold chocolate does not taste as good as slightly warmer chocolate. Cold temperatures also affect  chocolate texture.

Lol the salad pics

More cameras Better phone Papa John’s
I love your work its excellent and hilarious xD do more if you&#39;re passionate about it :b

Euwh! chocolate from the fridge taste like hardened butter &gt;.O

<a href="">1:31</a> i&#39;m Vietnamese too

Man, I&#39;m still surprised that Honor still sponsors Felix even after the US ban.

Link to this sub please

If you call David Tennant a C-list celebrity one more time, we gonna throw hands.

Haha haha.    KNEE-PILLS
I&#39;m a revendicated not 9 years old kid. It&#39;s a good video. Cool felix

It’s fine guys, at <a href="">12:32</a> she was just getting ready to surf the web

ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ban....one

He said nipples knee-pills
Every time Felix says &quot;soldering&quot; rather than pronouncing it &quot;soddering,&quot; I pull out one of my cerebral nerves.

My first thought when I saw this godawful alligator attacking a woman stock Pic was &quot;Miami be like&quot;The worst thing is I&#39;m not American, I&#39;ve never been to the USA/Miami, and idk why this was my first thought

<a href="">5:21</a> so this is what he&#39;s trying to do in his break??

<b><i>S T O N K</i></b>
Bigmoney is you

not everyday now

<a href="">7:29</a>Pewdiepie can tell the future

It took me a while to figure out that he was sponsored.....conspiracy??????

<a href="">8:18</a> that the people in the vid counting stars

<a href="">15:10</a> that moment when you understand the sequencing

I&#39;m from Vietnam and spitting on cocks as a pre-fight good luck charm isn&#39;t very common. Cock fighting used to be a popular gambling and spectating sport but has since become less common due to its violent nature.And its discrimination against the lgbt community. Now excuse me as I groom my chicken for the next fight. The bet is quite high this time.

Cheese? Anyone?

&quot;knee pills&quot; hehe......NICE

Yo

Sothe cake one was jsut a pun for shits and giggles? I love it!

Punk James Mcavoy cameo <a href="">4:49</a>

the blob fish looks very different under water but due to the immense pressure change of being brought to the surface their body looks like that

Honor sucks, you can&#39;t even root their phones anymore

<a href="">5:35</a> tried to make pun in french?

<a href="">3:06</a> it&#39;s not a hat it&#39;s just a pizza

Since you brought Happy wheels back...why not review your whole youtube years Like Maximillian Dood &gt; w&gt;

<a href="">3:28</a> low key think pewds needs to see a therapist

pewds i can’t afford this phone help

pewds i can’t afford this phone help

Pewdiepie sucks he dosent have good content

<b>”Thanks for describing the image for people who are blind!”</b>

HOW DARE YOU CALL DAVID TENNANT A C-LIST CELEBRITY(fake, but no so fake outrage)

pewds: stock photos need to be stopped ad right before video: adobe stock

<a href="">10:40</a> is not a stock image it is a sculpture by Australian artist Patricia Piccininiedit: there were actually a couple more of her sculptures in this video

Pewds sits down to pee.. through his pants. Don&#39;t know which is worse

<a href="">13:36</a> omg I get it granknee 
@<a href="">3:39</a> vegans be like

The hacker guy... with the pirate hat... is pirating... music... I didn’t realize that and now I feel dumb.

The one with the man, sleeping on a cake of sweet dreams and the one with the potato over a calculator - these really made sense to me. The rest was really complete bullshit.

chocolate in the fridge.... ugh you are literally a grandma on every level except physical Pewds.

pewds: we have all stuck our PP through thereme: i dont have PP

The first YouTube video I’ve laughed at in awhile

YOU’VE BEEN SPONSORED BY HONOR AND U DIDNT EVEN SAY « IT WAS AN H o n o r TO WORK WITH YOU » I’m so ANGRY
th one with cions and potato <a href="">13:47</a>  is south african those are 5 Rand coins

I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m strangely attracted to being a stock image poser... like, as  a job or a hobby, or whatever

Do you copy lazarbeam

They aren’t pills, they’re lentils.

I was eating chocolate and I put it in the fridge when you said ^put it in the fridge

When Pewds laughed at me I actually felt embarrassed

I DONT HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE AHHHHH

The foreigners won't understand anything
I didn't understand this ending, that is to say, I didn't think it was nothing kakakkak
I thought I was used to all the weird stock photos, but a few of these have got me thinking about what kind of fever dream somebody&#39;s having when they make this.

If you’re not blind look awaySwedish man looks at strange photos and laughs at his own dumb jokes about the photos

When Pewds said &quot;Beautiful Wamen&quot; I got an ad for &#39;Pretty Woman Musical&#39; LMAO

i dont have a app

I know I am a little bit late for the video but hauwei has the worst reputation ever, the backdoor system of it has been criticized for a long time, it is used by the chinese government to monitor its people... Just throw away your hauwei phone man...love your video btw

<a href="">2:22</a>Wait what

Middle of vid. Adobe stock ad

Im Egyptian and i always got confused when people said that salad or fruits taste horrible but i figured out that it tastes different sooo come to Egypt the fruits and vegetables are perfect 

<a href="">1:09</a> his eyes are so close together they can see either

<a href="">13:35</a> I thought that was something else took me a second to figure out it wasn’t what I thought it was

My salad was being racist the other day what do I do?

Everybody: eww blob fish is disgusting Felix: I’D FRICK IT

You people need to look up tofubeats&#39;s MV &quot;What You Got&quot; which is totally made out of stock footage. It&#39;s frickin hilarious.

I thought I was watching a different video (YLYL) and this was in the middle so... I was like... Why is this so short? What? And then I remembered...

4 tik tok adverts in this one video

David Tennant is not some B-C list celebrity. He&#39;s been in some of the most popular pieces of British media of all time, like Harry Potter or Doctor Who.

<a href="">1:23</a> Im vietnamese too, and i saw my uncle did that to my parrot xd

when you finally get declined by the church<a href="">14:53</a>

Pewdiepie: makes a video titled Stock images need to be stop!Youtube : Ah yes this seems like a suitable video for a Adobe Stock!lmao did anyone else get that add

I got a adobe stock ad at the start of the video

I like the way you speak pews

<a href="">11:45</a> we finally know who How To Basic is now

<b>o k  b o o m e r</b>
<a href="">2:30</a> <b>Pewds..blind people wouldn&#39;t be able to read it either.</b>

Nice

There&#39;s a possibility that kids in the future will end up analysing these pictures for literature

It,s me

Pewdiepie: *Shows the stock image  of the guy proposing  then drowning  the lady * This is how I proposed  to Mart-Media: <b>PEWDIEPIE  DROWNED HIS WIFE AND THEN SOMEHOW REVIVED HER</b>

Pewds: ... we have all done it” Me:  no

400 million VND please pew die 
I was not even smiling watching this video. I dont know why, may be because there was all blshit pictures

I got a stock photo ad on this video that said say it EPIC with adobe stock

did anyone else get like 5 adobe stock ads on this video? lol

This comment makes no sense

It&#39;s time to say <b>Templates</b> !!

Sis

Is there anyone Russian, fucking yopta?!
Something nice

Will Ferrell ? Really Felix ?

Pewdiepie:&quot;CHOCOLATE BELONGS IN THE FRIDGE&quot;×3Me:&quot;NOOO!!! IT BELONGS ON MY STOMACH!!!&quot;
when you thought pews was the chosen one but he doesn&#39;t know the doctor

No it shouldn’t!

<a href="">2:26</a> Well Felix.....Blind people can&#39;t read .

<b>hovchitsya in schoollike</b>

Does Pewdiepie know that Honor Belongs to Huawei??

Anybody else get Adobe Stock ads?

<a href="">4:13</a> legit wanted to square up when he exposed me to his friends

Snakes bite the dancing violin 
<a href="">3:45</a> is a pewDIEpie sighting

Gilbert Godfrey!!!!!

what&#39;s up gamers,my name is pewdiepie <b>waves his hands on the sides of his head</b> lol

never thought I&#39;d hear pewdiepie quoting limmy

Chocolate belongs in the freezer...

Pewds: thanks for describing this picture for blind people Me: Blind people can’t read?

Images strange God

Beautiful stock images....Adobe stock images add 

i didnt FUCKING blink get absolutely ended

This is absolutely ironic because I am watching this video and at the halfway point was an advertisement kicks in it shows an advertisement of adobe stock. Clap clap clap *

I’m glad to know I bought a jacket and gave you money to throw spaghetti in a forest

I am currently holding my eyes open to prove I didn&#39;t put my thing in the dvd disk player

It&#39;s not that lucrative because it&#39;s so easy to do. Way too much competition. Although some can have a successful career through stock photography, the vast majority do not make that much money.

Wait, William Osman didn&#39;t even reply to you?

<a href="">6:38</a> Well I have the Huawei p30 pro 

i got a add for stock images while watching this video.

Ur face HAHAHAHAHA IM EATING SALAD HAHAHAHAHA

I love the office lol

I IS A POTATO (<a href="">13:45</a>)

Does google work good in the US and with google or nah cuz pewds kinda sold me‍️

I know this probably wont be seen because its super late to the video,  but artists are why weird stock videos exist. As someone who draws i wouldnt call myself an artist, but i do use stock photos for art refrence. They are very helpful for figuring out how things look together. And people who draw, draw weird things.

45 degree... lmfao
Chocolate that comes outta the fridge lost all its taste

<a href="">7:50</a> it’s got pro in in it JUST LIKE THE IPHONE 11 PRO

This video was almost as funny as salad

<a href="">7:39</a><b>*hears the word &quot;holographic&quot;*</b>Cristine should try this

Honor is trash try apple

My mom just asked what I was watching because it sounded like PewDiePie, then proceeded to say she’s had two kids go through puberty &amp; PewDiePie

Where are the subtitles in Portuguese?
Merry Christmas Felix and Martzia (sorry if I misspelled your name, I&#39;m American,  lol)

I was literally eating a chocolate and then pewds said it 3 times Guess I&#39;ll put it in the fridge

im not blind

Heyyy how dare you call david tennant B C list celebrity. He played the 10th doctor on doctor who btw. The universally loved doctor everyone wants back. He&#39;s also on Broadchurch and Jessica Jones

The baguette is past its expiration date

i genuinely feel anxious when he says “GUYS LOOK AT THIS” and a bunch of eyes look at me

The way he said &quot;what gender.. burger baby is?&quot; just made my whole day <a href="">4:37</a>

Pewds: I&#39;M EATING SALAD HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

Fight dream
Its a 90° and not 45° you unsmart rich and successful man

I got an ad for stock photos before this video

fridge chocolate is not as good it ruins the chocolateyou are wrong phelix

Kavli

Pp good

I like it, so I want to buy it now <a href="">0:05</a>

&quot;this comment is a nice comment&quot;

It’s funny cause all those people he edited into his videos when he said “hey guys” were probably stock images

Chocolate belongs in the fridge!

I didn’t blink
If ur blind u can’t read what it is Unless BIG BRAIN!

<a href="">3:39</a> Best part of the video!

Is.tjis phone actually good or are you lying

When pewdiepie said &quot;just blink&quot; my eyelids burst into flames and fell off my face

i said Honor 20 Pro and my Honor 30 Pro exploded. Thanks Pewd!

If the burger has meat in it... It gets confusing with the buns wrapping it. But it does has some sauce.

surprised that Felix never once in the video said to send stock images to the ranch.

<b>when you get an adobe stock ad before the video starts why stock photos need to be stopped</b>

<a href="">3:42</a> low key looks kinda high

That stock image with the blobfish always makes me uncomfortable

I love your videos and I soooo want to get your merch sooooooooo BAD I&#39;m just not allowed to get things online I&#39;m so sad   

<a href="">3:13</a> Looks like Ben Shapiro
Sweet dreams is Justin Jorgensen...
I&#39;ve found my career... a stock photo actor, the dream job.

Is it me or is Felix&#39;s right eye is green and left is blue at <a href="">12:25</a>???

If you put chocolate in the fridge it becomes hard and cold and not at all pleasant to eat rofl

<a href="">2:30</a> if people are blind HOW THE HELL WOULD THEY READ IT TO UNDERSTAND THE PHOTO?!?!?!

Pewdiepie: Gets banned in ChinaHonor: Sponsors PewdiepieChina: Wait, that&#39;s illegal.

Pewds bought out by huawei now?

Just got a mobile game ad and it uses a green wow cataclysm sword as an asset.

<a href="">3:41</a> what a psychopath
