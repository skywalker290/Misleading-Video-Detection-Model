good concept but bad acting

Fake

So this man swan in the water with a shark and then took a picture with a tornado and now he’s witness a selfie stick fight?

Gay acting gay english gay everyone, YT now more gay

- How staged do you want it to be?- Yes!

If you can’t swim don’t start fights on boats ‍️
Welcome to 2015(T_T)

The guy who went overboard looks like he weighs 320 pounds and the Japanese dude looks like he weighs 150 pounds 

One!! 
gta 6 looks good right now

FaaaaaaaaakeThese rich kids got everything in the world ... and yet they still need to fake excitement...  what a bunch of losers

Fake

Okay second comment but this video is so under rated. Definitely deserves to be well over a million views by now! I&#39;m even inspired to memorize this like a monologue 

If the fight was real this is 10 x funnier

3 stereotypes at once. Americans just running around like they rule the world, japanese kicking asses and brits behaving like everyone around them is just npcs

Wtf kinda GTA V fight is this 

Hi momma
Make more vlogs dude
Even if fake that&#39;s a good lift and throw !

This is so fake.

If you believe this is real, please get some help

English: Oi mate watch it...Spanish: Oye tio cuidado...Japanese: Sumimasen, kidzukimasendeshitaEnglish (USA): Get the f*ck out of my waySpanish (Mexico): Quitese a la v*rga compaWhat? Y&#39;all thought there was only one with lack of manners?As a matter of fact it happens to everyone, we all get easily pissed off sometimes and start a shitshow like this one that ends in karma for us.

what

fake or not, still a great video

Lol very well choreographed

Fake but funny.

damn he threw a bigger guy

It&#39;s some really good edits cause it&#39;s fake

The Japanese guy won the battle, but not the war.  He couldn&#39;t swim, but the American wasn&#39;t finished yet.  The only way to win would be to drown him too...<b>Dives in after him</b>

Hahahaha funyyy
Lol why is this particular one age restricted? Didn’t know “boffer” was such a foul word 

Bro, this austrilians are very funny

this is faker than Nikki Manaj&#39;s assssss

FAKE

It&#39;s fake I think but who cares it&#39;s so funny 

Yah

Why are Americans so crazy

Its fake, he is the only one actully recording it, and its a good way to get your ass kicked or possible arrested if there is a guy that falls overboard and you just record it.

LOLOLOL yeah a guy that big would get thrown over board <a href="">#solegitprankgonewrongprankgonesexualgunpulledgonesexualcopscalled</a>

Wow this is so real!

RHYNO

Anyone went through the comments to see people saying &quot;who came here because of Is It Real?&quot;

SO FAKE

That was so fake. First of all, the girl is exclaiming that he can&#39;t swim. But then if you watch the guy in the water, he&#39;s perfectly fine, just floating through the water. This was some of the fakest shit I&#39;ve ever seen.

so fake,with terrible acting.

FAKE

What&#39;s wrong with that guy? Someone accidentally hits him and he starts shouting like if this was world war II. Really, are more people like this in there? Because all of them deserve to be thrown into the water with sharks. Good Job Japan.

Well Boffa, you missed it.

Lol He overreacted.

Staged. But if you didnt do that man over board thing at the end you might have fooled us

The fact that the woman is screaming in the background &quot;He can&#39;t swim, he can&#39;t swim!&quot; when he is quite easily swimming out of the shot proves to me this is totally fake.

SO FAKE BOFFA

This made it on Right This Minute.

Needs more selfie stick fighting, otherwise it&#39;s just a staged dunking.

fake and staged...

Will movies made in selfie stick view, be worse than shaky cam view movies? That time travel movie could have been great if it wasnt for the shaky cam.

So fake, but still kind of funny.

how come you guys didn&#39;t add in a shark like last time.

inb4 this goes viral 

Fake and gay

Asian brutality.
xd

wow same *****

this is what really needs to happen, enough of the selfie stick craze, bring back angry old men with canes, maybe that could be your next video &quot;selfie stick hipsters VS angry old farts with canes&quot; and they all die at the end, fingers crossed

Australians are annoying af

hah

Do you guys reckon there&#39;s sharks in that water? 

Wow I&#39;m very early

$100% real

I wanna have a beer with Boffa!!!

This is definately no fake! Awesome footage. Lucky guy to film this
