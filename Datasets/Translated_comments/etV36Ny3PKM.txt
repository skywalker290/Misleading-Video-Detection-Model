South movies are best 

This land is ours, this food is ours, why should we impose it on anyone, why is the work of our country getting worse instead of getting less?
Congratulations for 3 years of Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy

This is better than RRR

Only Tollywood makers have that confidence to pick such a real, documentary script... .. can&#39;t wait to see this another epic South movie... They are winning our heart day by day  bringing such  tremendous stories ..

Realised it on Gandhi Jayanti 

I haven't seen this trailer today, but I just watched Tammna's scene from a short video.

Everything is good but fast freedom battle was fought in. Odisha... called paika vidroha 1808..jay Raj guru was the fast person who martyred.

One of the best movie

Hail Mother India
Proud to be Reddy 

Bkwas, why muslims are not represented at all??? they fought side by side and gave thousands of lives and still not represented why?

Why is this release not happening?
you can&#39;t change history.  no matter how much gloriously present , bit or kick some British peoples . the fact is 200 years we become there slave. so it will lose the appetite . no gonna work in 2022

Best hai rrr se......
Woooooow beautiful ‍‍‍
Superb movie if this movie released in 2022 blockbuster

Pranaam Amar Shaheed Narasimha Reddy 🇮🇳
This movie is not on the YouTube chinal please Upload

Bollywod is islamic terror but south movies all the best 

True story true freedom fighters , syraaa

This movie seems to compete with Bahubali but due to lack of proper promotion, not much is known about this movie.
It's a great film about Narshimha ji but in this movie the Muslim character has been forced to bully Papakhan.
Full felm bejo

And people say that Gandhi liberated the country, such patriots have given freedom to the country. This is the pride of our country, it is a golden history. Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Get out for my mother land

Kiccha boss
Is this Chiranjeevi Saheb real voice?
Excellent 
Piz move send
This fight is not the first fight for freedom &#39;paika rebellion(1817)&#39; was the first .

This is how we did not get freedom, how many people sacrificed their lives, I am proud to have been born in India. Jai Shree Ram
If the hero was Ramcharan or Prabhas this movie would beat Bahubali the conclusion

Overglorification has become a language 
Here for Jaggu Sir
I felt that this movie should be at the top list of india like bahubali and all world will watch it. But it&#39;s all our fault that we don&#39;t give priority to such films. I am so sad that our country people watched war movie more insted of syeraa. That&#39;s why this happened.

Please upload full movie in hindi dubbed of it

Sayraa Narshima ready salute... But this second big movement against the English people is going to happen... Wrong information is given in the movie... Unpardh gaawaar. producers n directors...

Two megastars and two super stars in the same movies A galaxy of superstars in this movie ..loved it ..

Only if they had released this film on another date (avoiding the clash with WAR &amp; Joker) this could have been a blockbuster.

Amazing Super Wonderful
Diya baati hum
Itni shandaar movie ka koi zikr hi nhi...hua..my God...its Awesome...zabardast movie h ...why this is not play on tv..why?.

The heroes of India sacrificed their lives for freedom. This is what is shown in this movie. Very good work has been done.
Dravidain filmmakers are progressing in their own ways.

This is called a movie... Not like Bollywood/ Remakewood&#39;, &#39;Anti hindu&#39;, &#39;Urdu Film Industry&#39; Tollywood is much better.️

When will this film come in Hindi?
Jai Bharat Mata ki Jai Hind

It was surprising to know about the great freedom fighter of South India, till date there was not much discussion about him, but when a film was made on him, it was discussed all over the country and abroad, people started watching and respecting him, such patriots are born in centuries, Saira. Narasimha Reddy, salute to him, Jai Hind
Nice movie

Bollywood will never be able to compete with South Movies!
Boycott Bollywood

Felt gossebumps when he said &quot;Get out from my mother land&quot;

Whoever disliked it is not from India.

The truth of Englishman is shown in the movie, which this Bollywood 7 darling could not see.
Can anyone tell me are Reddy rajputs of south

All time block buster movie

I have read many reviews here. One of the dogs thinks that the movie is boring. I can't do anything right in my mind. I must have seen it once. If you don't fight for the country in your heart then nothing can happen. But what is he doing? He is not using your bad words. So I proud that chiranjivi sir made this movie and live like a Narsimha Reddy. Thanks sir.  I will say only one thing to the rest….Those who cannot take care of the country are bastards, cannot take oxygen. Go do one such thing so that the whole world remembers the country. Like the rest of the humans, they lived, ate, drank and lived like that. They also kill all these animals. Think about it.
Film makers forget SARDAR VALLABHAI PATEL AT THE end credit what a shame.

Nhi rhe chiranjeevi dekhen puri story https://youtu.be/sa6za1scPaw

Lol really thought those were American flags, I was like, the fuck??

Who watched 2020 ????? It&#39;s very good movie don&#39;t miss it

Power of Indian movie

Ertugrul Ghazi Is Best️
Plese ye movie upload kro hindi mai
How can be this movie a flop in india??!Shame on you Bollywood. Just watched it in amazon prime. Though I am not an indian, many of the scenes gave me goose bumps. P.s.- &#39;War&#39; movie was a no match against it. It’s difficult to understand the thinking of hindi language audience who preferred watching &quot;war&quot; and not this epic.

Bollywood banata hai movie - Dawood Ibrahim pe, hasina Parker, Maya dolas, hazi mastan, Sanjay dutt, akbar, khilji peAur kaha he kya jaye.. Kuch sabk le South se ye..This movie should be show in schools

Jai ho chiru

Super hi

Good
Where is the full movie?
Now what about darbar?

Factually inaccurate... Although all freedom fighters must be hero worshipped, the first rebellion against the British oppression was by Baba Tilka Manjhi.. The year 1784 is considered as the first armed rebellion against the British and was the beginning of Paharia. It was due to great famine in 1770 and the consequences of Court of Directors orders influenced by William Pitt the Younger -- Court of Director issued ten year of the settlement of Zamindariand later in 1800 - this resulted in minimum chance to negotiate between local Zamdindars and Santhal villagers. Baba Tilka Majhi attacked Augustus Cleveland, British commissioner [lieutenant], and Rajmahal with a Gulel (a weapon similar to slingshot) who died later. The British surrounded the Tilapore forest from which he operated but he and his men held them at bay for several weeks. When he was finally caught in 1784, he was tied to the tail of a horse and dragged all the way to the collector&#39;s residence at Bhagalpur, Bihar, India. There, his lacerated body was hung from a Banyan tree.

I watching the both movie war and syra narasimha reddy on streaming platform, Chiranjeevi sir ki kahin jyada achi h, now i am regret that, why i am not watching this legend movie on theatres.

In the first battle with the British, where could you see so many Englishmen??? Make something and write a real story to know what you are???
i cried after he said &#39;Get out from my motherland&#39;. Made my throat shiver. Such a beautiful and true emotion.

This movie gave me goosebumps 

Make a movie on Prithviraj Chauhan
My Indian bros watch this movie its really great.i will rate it 10/10...

ye movie dekh ke , thoda andaza aa gaya  ke south me christian aaye kaise !

khattra movie..

It&#39;s a good movie with an impressive cast and amazing visuals. Story is good, performance are good specially Chiranjeevi and Kiccha Sudeep.  There are some breathtaking visuals. But the movie is too long and there are some unnecessary scenes. But it&#39;s a entertaining movie.

Nice movie
When i read based on true story oh my god I&#39;m dying...

British army died like mosquito
Zabardast movie luv from pakistan

Bachan Sahab love you
It is a matter of great shame that such a good film could do so little business in the Hindi market. This film should have been more famous.
It&#39;s a great historical movie. Every one should watch the movie of  this subcontinent.

This is not a film, this is a new history of my life.
Sew 1st

When lakhs of people were sacrificed, which slave said that we have freedom without a sword and without a shield, whereas the reality is that the first military leader of independent India was Lord Mountbatten. Can any slave give an opinion on this?
Best movie...kgf syeraaa bahubali...magdhira....
Fantastic movie jai hind

Baxi Jagabandhu was the first journalist who fought against the British in Odisha in 1817 (first rebellion for independence) and did (not Narsingh Reddy) a big star, a big hit movie, history will not change. Mother India will die.
Tremendous actions that the heroes of India did in real life.

Cool movie. Bollywood is inferior to Madras films
The first person to fight a war against the British is Tipu Sultan, the first person to fight for independence, not what is shown in the film. Those who agree with me, like it.

Fuk

This movie is like thogs of Hindustan

How many people read my comment about thugs of India? I am making a movie in my mind and I have captured all the movies of Tollywood. What is this? The name of the film will be simply UNDULUS, the story will start from Spain and the name of the prince will be Imad-Berber and the name of the pauper will be Saad-Arab (The poster will be like this Maejor Ali - Lolly ft. Juicy J, Justin Bieber)Prince and Pauper by Mark Twain There is a book on this story, there will be a climax like a narnia movie if Shah Rukh Khan's sons and Shah Rukh Khan himself are ready to soon become the main Hyderabadi Telangana resident, who are the financiers??? raja aur runk ke remix songs bhi (+) tu kitni achi hai tu kitni bholi hai pyaari pyaari hai, sunlo desh wasiyo....people have spoken negatively about many thugs of hindostan but the reality is that it is like a movie. This is a film which has become a hindrance in the collections of Mughals and Azam, just like the Asoka film also did a lot and Bahubali is not much in front of Asoka and the story of Bahubali is on an undulating span (end) but this is the reality in my view of Bollywood. Everyone does not like the old movies because if Hollywood people do such movies then they will keep kissing their heads with their eyes like that movie is kingdom of heaven ..........main amir khan and thugs of Hindustan will do four stars..... Those people who think that their money has been wasted have already spent this song, hey mama hindi indian rock song, their money was wasted soon if the thugs of hindostan are named by any English person. Aslam Rahi Naseem Hijazi writes Inayatullah Altamash, it would be like 300 movie 2nd part which is based on Khairuddin Barbarosa's novel Aslam Rahi...... main and a movie is being made in his mind whose name is maleech which is on Somnath temple. will...............

Better then war

Sorry this is not the first indian fight against British. The first revolution was brought up by Jayee rajguru in 1804 which was forwarded by bakshi jagabandhu in 1817. The first spark of revolution was from the land of Odisha. Syra&#39;s effort against British govt. was of 1846.

Starting bit background music reminded me of Assassin Creed series, and was corroborated with the Eagle spanning wings!!

Bkwas movie hai.....Flop...movie ..
Don&#39;t know why South actors like Rajini,Chiranjeevi can still play lead roles  at these ages (60+) whereas Bollywood actors who once were superstars like Anil Kapoor,Amitabh Bacchan,Govinda had/has to play side roles on their 60s  instead of playing lead roles.. Don&#39;t know how longer are Khans going to play lead roles.. On Bollywood stardom doesn&#39;t matter that much like south.. 

This movie's link will be found
Chiru deserves a lot more fame all over India than he has today. Very late in his career but still respected highly, yet most people in North India don&#39;t know about his dancing moves and punch dialogues.

Some says gandhi ji gives freedom by quit india movement

<a href="">

The dislikes are from people who makes &quot;reaction videos&quot;

Historical Movie Thank you Mr. Surender Reddy
Who is here after watching this movie

This is wrong. This was not the first freedom battle of India. The first freedom battle was fought by Paikas of Khorda, Odisha which was intiated n leaded by Sri Jayi Rajguru and Shri Baxi Jagabandhu.

It is not 1st battle against company

Get out from my stupid land

Blockbuster
This is not a first battle of India Odisha paika bidruha 1817 is first Battle in India

Amitabh sir an Chiranjivi sir still rocking the cinema industry!

Oh my god I can’t wait for that movie coming o YouTube

ato bahubali ka conceptbahubali 3 ha ha ha
Paika Bidroh happened in Odisha in 1917
1st andolan paika bidroh hua tha odisha me...

Why not make a film on it?
Sye Raa Ringtone:
If you are also a lover of south movie like because south believes in real story...... bollywood bawas
6 december 2019 amazon prime
Awesome movie like bahubali

Movie is good. But it&#39;s not a true story. Bcz the 1st battle for freedom is PAIKA BIDROHO , which was lead by JAI RAJ GURU IN 1804 and continued by  THE GREAT FREEDOM FIGHTER BAKSHI JAGABANDHU in 1817... See the Indian history books

Goos bomb word&#39;s

This history has been stolen. This is the story of the king of Yadavas, this is the story of Maharaja Alagamuthu Kone Yadav, giving the name Narasimha Reddy.
Phela yudha paika bidroha in khordha odisha

OMG I hate who ever disliked this movie....

Horse shit fantasy. You didn&#39; t win independence until 1947, and it was only because the British GAVE IT TO YOU.

Joss movie:)

Promo 1no..
Yashraj film&#39;s <a href="">#War</a> has killed the chances of Sye Raa in Bollywood.

Mega Star Chiranjeevi’s highly anticipated flick Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy which was made on grand scale and had presence of popular actors from various languages is turning out to be an utter flop in all languages, except for Telugu.Sye Raa featured Amitabh Bachchan, Sudeep,Vijay Sethupathi , Jagapati Babu and several other noted actors from various other languages. Still, the film failed to rake even decent numbers in Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi.

Film achatha mana nei par itihass ko jhutt bana dia ye thik nei.PAIKA bidroha pehle huatha uske sab kuch hua he thoda itibas bhi padhlia karooo. aaj kall loak book se jyada dekh kar jante he or aisa banana thik nei he

Just the name itself gives me goosebumps

Nayanzzzz 
Just watched this movie , what a masterpiece , hats off

If all the rulers were like Him at that time INDIA would have been freed at that time only.

This movie looks interesting but i wish there were less slow motion&#39;s fight ! It&#39;s a bit pointless

Lovely movie for entire nation an epic just like Bahubali 

Super

The director and board such an idiots and fools. This is not the 1st freedom fight in india.. The 1st freedom fight was  held in  ODISHA in 1817 called as PAIKA BIDROH. After the death of Jayee Rajguru the rebellion fight was lead by Boxi Jgabandhu Das. Please go and search aboit 1817 PAIKA REBELLION. Don&#39;t share and teach fake news to audiance.

Tamannah looks very Bold and Beautiful.. 

Eska send full movie
First battle freedom fighter,real hero of our nation

Top trailer 
It&#39;s got brilliant cinematics, and while the story line is probably a bit of a twist from the real version of events, it was a great pleasure to see. The main criticism I have is, why do they have North Indians with Telugu voice overs, when they can just have Telugu actors who speak fluent Telugu?? I didn&#39;t like seeing Amitabh Bachchan. Uttar Bharati vaalaku manaa desham vaal ante emi maryaadha undadhu, manamu enthuku vaalani goppaka chuustham???

This is not first battle for freedom .The first battle for freedom was occurred in odisha.

kab released hogi

When will you film me friend?
The first fight against british is not in 1857 in south india or anywhere else... The first fight against british was in 1817 and the leader was BAKSHI JAGABANDHU.. Which is known as paika bidroh in odisha.. For the first time jayi rajguru in 1803 attacked on british coz they have cheated with marathas and odias... But the original armed fight against british was &#39;PAIKA BIDROH&#39;in 1817...humble request to the director sir... Please from next time please read alot of history books before make a film.. Thnk u

Get out from the kashmir.

This is really superb and hit today I cried all of my heart watching this movie bahut khub I&#39;m from Morocco

Odisha&#39;s  Paika Bidroha is the 1st freedom fight against the british.Which leader is Boxi Jagabandhu Bidhyadhar and held in 1817.

This is not 1st fight against British .1817 paika rebellion was the 1st fight against British

Sir chiranjivi what a great movie.

Get out from my motherland

Best motivational and inspirational movie  jbarjust mind-blowing 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
A fucking movie...telegu ppl infamous for smuggling..gundagiri and cheap people..their contribution is significantly little...very much little...better to say nothing in independence...By releasing some movie no1 become freedom fighter or patriotism in real sense..in portblair jail..if anybody went they can say the real truth...in 170 sahi(hanged by British)..only 2 from andhra...so fucking movie I must say... Better make more movie on rape...smuggling..u ppl nature match with those  better ...

Megastar is megastar

War movie se kahi behtar hai dhasssu movie after watching i will comment here plzz don´t compare war with syerra narasimhaa reddy 
Sir, what is the copy right for uploading a movie trailer?
Historically speaking, only Tipu Sultan was as shown in the movie

It&#39;s not first protest. First protest was held in Kalinga called as paika bidroho. Read history before making any movie. Dear director Don&#39;t try to fool people by your half literate knowledge.

Ek dam bakwaas movie... Little copy of bahubali...there sud be prabhas instead of chiranjivi.

Movie please upload

Excellent movie but information wrongly conveyed by the director....shame on him.

The first war against brithish was not started by syraa narshima Reddy it was started by baxi jagabandhu who belongs from odisha , if u don&#39;t believe me then search it on Google it shows paika bidroha which was started by baxi jagabandhu in khorda dist in odisha .

All Indian nationals should watch this movie and feel the efforts of freedom struggle. It&#39;s every Indian&#39;s responsibility to watch this movie. But North Indians are not entertaining this movie much! They prefer fancy movies over these historical movies. Partiality. Shame

This was not ist war in India

Bhaubali part 3 
Nice movie

Once upon a time British ruled Now a days politicians are ruling

M here after seeing the movie.It&#39;s beyond words. The unparalleled energy of megastar Cheeranjeevi , flawless acting of entire  cast and  awesome story .It has filled me with patriotism and energy.Must watch it .Ho syeraaa ho syeraaa......

Odisha ke hero ka story copied telgu
All the fans of the movie, hero or Person in movie Narasimha Reddy kindly find the Wikipedia page which has taken points written by Venugopal K Reddy, which exhibits him in Villainous bad light...correct it or understand it The Polygars and other higher-status people who preferred the old agrarian system &quot;represented the decadent social order&quot;, were in many cases &quot;upstarts&quot; and &quot;were also the heirs of a social system in which various orders of Hindu society were integrated through ages&quot;. These people were dispossessed of their lands, which were then redistributed, but the primary purpose of the changes was to increase production rather than to restructure the social order. In some cases, it coincided with a punishment because among the dispossessed were those who had recently been involved in fighting the EIC in the Polygar Wars. Some received pensions in lieu of the lost lands but at inconsistent rates.[1]

When is Narshima's name known in Freedom Fighters?
In front of the Englishmen, the first bird to enter was the one who started from Orissa and told this story.

Wow  super
Who is waiting for kgf chapter 2

This is not first freedom movement. The first freedom movement was started in Odisha around 1820 by Buxi Jagabandhu. It is also known as Paika revolution. Historically this is also an accepted fact. But all the respect to all the freedom fighters. They all are pride of India.

Long live Mother India

This is not 1st battel for freedom The 1st battel is sipahi bidroha On 1757 baxi jagabandhu Is 1st

Next rana pratap sing

Jabardast movie h
Hey ..get out respect retirement, give opportunity to other artists..I believe as a mega star you can help and make a better India, help India to believe themselves not you and lambu..I believe on myself..

Odisha. Of first war bitters against Bakshi Jagabandhu 1802
I watch this full movie on 2 October

Ist freedom fight was paika bidroha..In odisha ,,this film give us wrong message...

Super movie
Super

i am a big fan of south . but first freedom fight  against british started by bakshi jagabandhu from odisha .  but i proud for Syeraa narasimha reddy

Bollywood just spreading nudeness, Tollywood spreading and protecting Indian history and culture....

Who is HERE after watching MOVIE ???.

India's first freedom fight started in Odisha because the producer gave wrong information to Boxi Jagabandu.
Flop picture

Excel movies -- plan some strategy &amp; promote it in Hindi

Dhasuuu movie..Masterpiece movie heeee......
<a href="">

Dear Indians, my country (Kahmir) will sing and sing, there will be a war.
kiccha boss 
Narshim is ready to fight the first war against the British and the whole country has already fought, but he did not fight the first war against the British. This is an insult to our heritage.
Here attention plz..yes,this movie will be super duper hit..bt here z a big mistake that, THE 1st BATTLE FOR FREEDOM IS NOT THIS. 1st BATTLE IS &quot; PAIKA REBELLION &quot; WHICH WAS ON 1804 FROM ODISHA BY JAYI RAJGURU &amp; CONTINUED ON 1817 BY BAKSI JAGABNDHU. So plz, Dear Director sir, before u make a film u have to know the total story of our independent.

Goosebumps movie please make movies like this to inspire us

Ye fake fiml he check history

Great inspiration

This movie is super

It is bad to make a film like this, it is better not to make a film.
No words for this movie.

The hell story

Hindhi people&#39;s  sapport syeraa movies  this  is indian freedom fighter   Please respect

good films
She is not the first independent woman, the first woman was born in Odisha, Jai Rajguru, or Bakshi Jagbandhu has wrongly stated in the film that she is the first independent woman.
But history has been tampered in this movie. Filmed incident is not the first freedom fight. Paika riot from Khordha, Odisha was the first  freedom struggle in 1917 many years before this.

Jordar Actions

One of the best movie

This filmy odia pua should be named after Bakshi Jagabandhu, this filmy odia pua apaman should be done.
I think war movie fans paid for dis likers and there funds are over for just 15k dislikes.... If Chiru fans have a thought of dis liking war trailer... It will be the worlds most disliking video..<a href="">#bossisback</a> <a href="">#jaisyera</a>

Ye to all you have
So happy this movie floppedWAR is much better

How donlod

Nicee  move

What is the matter in hindi hirthik bought friends faran, rishi rigths...for 25 crores..., then deal with hirthik, don't promote saira, don't go to theaters...I will do three movies with you. Earlier, Karan Johar wanted to buy Dharma Productions...Moreover, North made it one thing that there should be no South Domination...
War is much better than this movie

YRF: War has more multiplex shows all over IndiaChiranjeevi: I have more fan supports all over India......

Movie gajab heee bhaii...ek nom-1 movie hee dekho sab

A fake story and writter

21m

Seen twice, tomorrow one more time, historic movie.

The first freedom fight took place in Odisha in 1817.
He is not the first warrior of Swatranta. The first war of independence took place in Odisha in 1817. The writer did not know anything about history.
South Indian movie shows indian hindu culture tradition very well .south m indian hindu culture safe Raha north to destroy Kiya afgano turko khilzi tuglaq Babur Aurangazeb taimur .destroy many kingdom University .Bollywood bhi anti hindu aur pro western ho gya he aajkal

All the best

I

Jay hindh
Please flop kardo if you real Indians

False information about fight .that was sipahi war

Disaster

Flop.........

False information about freedom fighters

Tera film hoga .producer ne jute
Mega Star jai
Who disliked him? What is your main food?
Tipu Sultan was the first freedom Fighter.

Everything is good but ..Not the 1st battle fight..u can chk history..

Get out from my mother land 15k dislike r&#39;s 

Odisha&#39;s Paika Bidroha lead by Baxi Jagabandhu is the first battle for the Freedom India started in 1804.

Vijay sethupatti sudeep kicha fans hit like 
Sye ra narshima reddy is not the 1st freedom fight.. Odisha(paika bidroha) is the 1st freedom fight against britishers which was led by jayi rajguru and buxi jagabandhu... remember it

Dialogues resemble bahubaly
Swatantra keliye e pehela war nehi tha. Palasi war in odisha first war of Swatantra...

They are claiming that it is the first independence war but the first was Paika rebellion in 1817

Desh ajad ho chuka hai ab history pe picture bna ke hero kyo ban rhe ho pls jo ajj ke time pe is desh mein problem s chl rhi h un ke liye kuch kijiye unemployment ko khtm kijiye. Isi me desh ka bhla. Ye sab mistory h jo ki fiction hai. Ye sab bakwas hai. Jai hind...

Exel   failed syeraa bollywood promotions

This is not the 1st revolt in  than british

First freedom rebellion movement was 1817 <a href="">#paika</a> bidroh by <a href="">#jayeeraj</a> guru ,Then how it is the 1st freedom rebellion movement by <a href="">#syera</a> narshimha ?

super hit

salute to the SOUTH INDIAN FILM INDUSTRY. but i feel shame on BOLLYWOOD which industry does not even tries to make such a movie.

mr. producer you are so weak in history that you dont even know thats not the first independence movement , the first movement is &quot;PAIKA VIDROH &quot; held in 1804 by great JAYEE RAJGURU  britishers torn his body into two pieces while he was fully conscious , so stop fooling people  be a true indian , admit it or google it ...

Where is the wrong saying that this is the first war in the entire world and in India we have fought that the first independence war has ended and there is rebellion in it. We want justice Telugu film industry bye..bye...
The first war of independence is the rebellion in Odisha. In this movie it is said that this is the first war.
We need justice because this is an insult to Odisha.
The first war of independence is the rebellion in Odisha. In this movie it is said that this is the first war.
The first war of independence is the rebellion in Odisha. In this movie it is said that this is the first war.
The first war of independence is in rebellion at the place of Odisha. What is wrong in this movie is that this is the 1st war in the whole world and in India. We want justice Telugu film industry bye..bye...

Khata utter flop Chiranjeevi acting super
Mujko lagta h yeh movie bahubali ko takkar degi Sach m

Wow !

Mega Star,
This is not the 1st protest against british.Why spread fake things .1st protest is (paika bidhro)from odisha ...

Upload karo youtub par

Gooesbumps

I watched the movie and i really liked it.Chiranjeevi sir acting is awesome.And all actors did very good job

I read in our childhood paika bidroha is first battle of freedom which is started in the year 1804 and ends in the  year 1817 (odisha) . In the year 2017 our india govt also  arrange a tribute ceremony to our legends at New Delhi.   Google it.

Everyone's history is being made into a film, the type of Sultan should not be made, Hyderabadi is a real hero.
Indian first revolution against british is Paika rebellion in 1817.. While narsimha reddy revolution happened in 1846..

Please sya raa movie download

Father(actor) and son(producer) combo

15k dislikd gaddar. Randi ki olaade
If you are making movie on a Historical figure atleast preserve correct History.For earning money do not create fake stories.How can Chenchu Reddy speak English.Lord governer never introduced English by then.Also Tamil character by Vijay Sethupathi is just a creation.Actual person was a Telugu person.Also there was no beard on Actual Narasimha Reddy face.

Even though we were warriors, India did not understand the slave.
Super
Get out from my mother land. I like it

Gajab

South Indian movies are really patriotic

Hit hai hit superhit
Bollywood is chutiyawoodSouth is real indian film industry

Fully not true story except a little moment...and in the movie a young hero was needed as a main rule.the old man chiranjeeb infact he was famous once upon a time but that&#39;s time already up...we new generation want youth star, not old...don&#39;t mind. This is my opinion...

Becouse of clash this movie comes in 2nd after war

This movie is better than war movie

20 million views that&#39;s the power of chiranjeevi

Superb

Nice....p

This not the first freedom fight........1st freedom fight was from ODISHA that Was PAIKA BIDROHH under The leadership of  Sri Jai Raj Guru And Sri Bakshi Jagbandhu...!

Har Har Mahadev... Sanatan Dharma is becoming strong again... Jai Shri Ram
Bollywood is busy with Hindu phobia, thanks Tollywood.

English rule was much superior to this revolt nothing happened all revolters met their end n only Gandhi n I mean only Gandhi  could gave us  freedom bcoz he knew we could win only through brains n not strength... they were damn superior many tried to fight all failed including netaji
