14 years old vfx



the vfx is damn good for 14 yrs back

Cant believe this was made the year i was born

Put this in someone&#39;s pants.

I found it over 10 years later. This video randomly just popped in my head

Classic

DID SOMEONE SAY BOOM?!

For 14 years ago this is good cgi

I am 7 years old and believed it but my dad told me it’s not real.. and I know this nuclear bomb is an animation because you always do animated videos..

Nice home made nuclear

Used to watch this when I was little and then thinking that I would create it

Instructions unclear, eastern U.S. now nuclear wasteland

Some brilliant minds in here, showing true engineering prowess, letting us know this video is edited.

I swear to god I thought it was real when I saw it around 10 to 12 years ago

Was he just blown off? Damn that was such a powerful fake that made a shockwave through idiots/retards!

i remember when i was small i begged my parents for this but it aint real lol

️

this has a better explosion effect then modern video games nowadays. side note it&#39;s nice to see this video again after all these years. ah good times, good times...

dude has a NASA pc back in 2010

It is a fake 100% fake

This is made with a material called (editing and photoshop)it is quit remarkable due to the video effects and the right software that produces such an experience.   Edit : why didn’t any one get pushed by the “ReAl” shockwave. plus why did he make that sound? Another edit: the table would of bursted or exploded and went up in flames.

When I was younger I actually believed on this

13 years ago I believed that it is true

I just saw this, I want it to be real, I want to make 10 of them……

Fပငk...I really believed that last 12yrs.

Now just put a tiny city called hiroshima, and your done

better than Marvel&#39;s CGI

Shockwave didn’t move anything…. At least the table should melt.

Esa pinche mamada qué?

Is that mini nuke?

wtf

cant believe 13 years have passed

&quot;Hold on let me pull out my matches box to lit up the campfire&quot;Campers: <b>Confused screaming</b>What do we learn, do the primitive way to start the campfire

Only in ohio

It&#39;s a prank by after effect

it was 13 years ago, and very well edited for that time

I remember when I watched this back in the days and believed it was real.

Are these people still alive or have they  from radiaton poisoning ??

Quando criança, tava vendo muito como fazer uma bomba atômica... pode ser estranho pra alguns, por mais que eu não goste de guerras, mortes... enfim, sempre me diverte o EFEITO da explosão.. (não nas pessoas, obviamente)... e eu acreditei que a bomba NESSE vídeo era real. Fiquei bem empolgado em ver uma mini explosão cogumelo... quando lembrei desse vídeo agora, pesquisei e como eu esperava... pessoas zuando o vídeo fake. Kkkkk Mas assim como elas, realmente... ainda é muito bem feito! xD

Don’t try this at home unless ur 18 and older Warning: contains radioactive substances and can lead to ect call for the U.S government or anyone to help if it ends up going to op Not responsible if WW3 starts

I bet afterwards he had to go to the hospital for radiation poisoning. What would the doctors have thought?

Nul à chier

Ахаха супер

App name pls 

I was so small kid I saw your video. Now after being adult I came again searching for your video. And now  I subscribed your channel. ;)

i watched this as a kid and disliked it after finding out it was fake 

DONT MAKE THIS AT HOME   ()

BEESHWADAFA- ️

I wish it was that easy to make nukes...

<a href="">0:20</a> the microwave when you waved something explosive

Interestingly enough, despite the fact this video is fake, there is nothing - in principle - stopping you from building a nuclear bomb that small. Wouldn&#39;t make a mushroom cloud, but at least in theory, a bomb with a few grams of explosive yield is possible (though wether you could make one in practice is another matter)

Damn they can edit better than other huge popular YouTubers and this was 13 years ago?!?! Damn imagine how BETTER they can edit now with today&#39;s technology and sh*t..

I would use it to destroy hornet nests and shit.

I actually thought this was legit

i thought this was real and begged my parents to make it

The mushroom cloud wouldn&#39;t exist because the explosion doesn&#39;t reach the end of the atmosphere

Even though this was fake it was actually still pretty cool

So real 

Your phone when you reply to a message that says do not reply:

Man thats the smallest explotion i ever seing

these guys are masters of editing, on top of that it was 12 years ago

Efectasos especiales

There used to be a &quot;pinktonium&quot; video too.. what happened?

i thought this was real 7 years ago

Not work

Nice edits.

HOW DID U MADE IT TELL ME!!!!

An ad on a <a href="">0:40</a> second video is so annoying YouTube

How the fuck do you

lmao

The editing is so amzaing for a 12 year old video. Its even better then some editing today

I remember watching this as a kid ahhhh the memories

Fake

普通の爆弾ならまだいいが原爆は意味わからん、軽く扱うなよ白人

I remember video from when I was like 8 or 9 at the time 

Back when i belived nukes can be tested on tables

looks fake

I think this is fake

for 2009 the special effects are amazing

Imagine being an Ant on that table only to get incinerated.

I know this isn’t real but when he got blown away that was SICK acting

Wow....

Nice editing

bruh back in the days i thought it was real lol, what a internet days

<a href="">0:27</a><b>Praise</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom</b>

lmao

This year is when im not born yet-

POV your 6 and tried making this only to find out that its <b>&quot;cgi editing&quot;</b>

This and that Modern Warfare 2 Old Lady video are probably the best edited clips i&#39;ve seen for it&#39;s time

this was the video I learned alllll about video tracking and green screening in After Effects lol

Cool mini nuke

That is pretty good editing for 12 years ago

Noice edit bro

How to make.

I wish it was real, I mean you can make actual nuke like smoke effects with appropriate equipment

SOOO REAAAL

I need a bigger one

13 лет назад...

It&#39;s so fake

@DeadAceFilms why the hell did you guys take your &#39;pinktonium: gay nuke&#39; video down for ??? Please re-upload that video for youtube.

<a href="">0:21</a> Why the Match Sticks are not move away with Strong Shock Wave??.

Even tho thsi is fake it looks cool

Q da hora mano! Sorte que não é de verdade kkk

When your redneck neighbors light the grill

I love this video Shrek



Nostalgia

Teacher explaining how atomic bomb works Le backbenchers

2 minutes silence for those who thought its real...

This is fake

Unbelievably good editing for 12 years ago

Wait, this was 12 years ago? Iam old

I&#39;m sure this video title got the video some extra curicular attention by some high up assholes.

Wowwwww nice editing 

but i like it tho

in 2021 thats ok

Better than the vanguard nuke

<a href="">0:30</a> I love how he just flies away

After effect

Damn this video fooled us 

Homemade chemotherapy.

I swear I  remember when I believed that it when I was young, Then I searched for it again for the nostalgia 

Edit

Atomic Ant Warfare

Thanks for cg boom blast bich

2021... I am sure this channel moderator made good money from this Video..

Cool editing skils

When I was little I tried buying it on ebay

That for lego

why dient the table get rekt whit that power the table would have been destroyed

I thought this was real.

Super fake

Good: very clever effects ngl it’s realistic but not completely realisticBad: it was fake and wasn’t a real nuke.

I believe 

That&#39;s fakeMm

Edit right?

lol

This is really stupid. These effects never get old

Fake

This is the first video I remember watching on YouTube 11 years ago.

66000 dislikes in 65000 likes

I got it by your acting

clickbait LOL

Edited but good edit 

Nice gfx rendering

a nuke is nuclear so you wouldnt surviveik it animation

in 2013 it real but in 2021 it fake look

Poda fake bhaiya

can you believe this is 11 years ago

I&#39;m 60 next month &amp; I still don&#39;t know how to set off these tiny nuke&#39;s w/o irradiating my whole back yard? But I keep moving to another house each time I have another failure to contain the active isotopes. I recall the first year I got fission in a matchbox size device I had to move 18 times in 3 months.

I show people this video still , I can&#39;t believe no one I know has seen this before , this is a Classic To me (I love the video) &amp;  V Same V

X

Lmao i love how this is the guy faked the OLD Lady in Mw2

lmao

F for all of us that thought this was real

E

Today I got the truth  and I am 21 now ..fuck I thought it was real from my whole life....Even I tried to make it many times My whole efforts were

A decade ago itself there were good VFX technology

If I have known how to make nuclear boom the world will be in danger 

Fake

EDITED

if that thing were dinetonate on ant hill that would be devastating to them

Bro I was 7 when I saw this and i&#39;m now 15 and am remembering how phuqing awesome I thought this was. (Still cool though)

oof this is animation.. nvm good

Lol, It puzzles me why a game like DCS a realistic military flight combat simulator With really good graphics but the nuclear bomb in the sim has terrible explosion effects for its explosion and you guys in 2009 doing a better job at making one, even tho it still does not look like a real nuclear explosion with that black smoke which should only be there at the end of the plasma aka fire

Asli apa palsu itu...?? Kelihatan nya editan

this looks kinda fake ngl

Làtszòdik hogy kamu

It is a lot of things 1 stupid 2 bad effects 3 stupid again

fake

Nice effects

Nice edting

This is fake because if you wanted to make an mushroom cloud you would need to make it go up to the asphosphere like all real nukes, and you can make an shockwave but none that is visible except if it is an real nuke. If some words are misspelled i am very sorry.

This is the biggest fake on YouTube

not real but cool

Why the hell does this have so many dislikes?? THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!

Cgi

Good editing

It’s edited

FAKE

This is so fake

Someone: Makes a joke video for fun6 out of 10 people: This is clearly fake and the title is misleading. Dislike!

shitass effrcts bro

Good photoshop guys.

Fotoshop

Not true

First of all when i saw the thumbnail i though it was a smoke lantern

Fake for 2 reasons1: nukes can’t be that small2: even if nukes can be that small, the core of nukes gets up to millions of degrees Fahrenheit and would seriously burn you from that distance

Do not attemp to do this anywhere! Unless you know a good software

Why tf does this masterpiece have more disIikes? Are peopIe just dumbasses nowadays? Had hope in humanity 5 mins ago then bunch of 12 yr oIds with a defunct brain had to ruin it

I can clearly tell it&#39;s fake because if it was real the shockwaves would have killed you

&quot;Homemade nuke&quot; out of context sounds weird

Is not real but nice affect!

I was 2 weeksAnd one day old when this was published.

If that blast was real you would both be dead.

OMG I TRIED IT AT HOME AND OT ACTUALLY WORKED 

Pura montagem

Great CGI my friend
