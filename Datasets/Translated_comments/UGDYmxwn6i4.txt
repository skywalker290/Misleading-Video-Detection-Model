Pewds is real brave making these kinds of videos considering his own stream fails

What video was the original simp clip from?

Mr Beast is Better

Tbf to the anti-tipping streamer, tipping shouldn&#39;t be required restaurants should just pay their staff lmao.

pewdiepie is rich why does he still have a shitty camera

well what about SVEN

<a href="">7:25</a> this is cute how he&#39;s love smacked

David dobrik lol

<a href="">8:02</a> <b>dying in 2fps</b>

Nice

<a href="">4:20</a> I&#39;m almost 3 years late to this. I finally could get fiber and can watch YouTube again. I&#39;m so lost on the last 9 years of internet because of fucking HughesNet.

Not PewDiePie reacting to a guy reacting to PewDiePie reacting to a guy reacting to some streamer 💀

Tipping in America incentivizes them to be nice. YES, America needs that😂

First clip PewDiePie reacting a guy who is reacting PewDiePie who is  reacting a girl. How many reactions are going on 😂😂

If a guy voice cracks while trying to fight so hard to convince he&#39;s 5&#39;7&quot;, he&#39;s a gnome.

I know what pewd likes the most CAKE FARTS

<a href="">10:23</a> / <a href="">11:04</a>

What has happend to you Felix

<a href="">7:45</a> dude was probably talking to his kid lol. if he was talking to his partner, call the swat and get that man in an asylum .

pewdiepie reacted to a guy reacting to him reacting to a streamer reacting to ppl not giving her money from people reacting to her being a b*tch.we have evolved.

E

The &quot;barrels&quot; option for what pewdiepie likes at the start triggers some deeply set old youtube knowledge that I can&#39;t quite place

Plot twist: there is n9 plot twist

On the never defend a women it depends on who the women is If it’s your mom you have no choice If it’s every other girl there is always a choice to not defend

<a href="">7:17</a> that tone the posture pewds is a S.I.M.P!!!

“BARRELS!!”

Reaction inception

<a href="">8:07</a> THE CAMERA QUALITY 🤣💀
It’s called schadenfreude
BARRELSSSS what a trick question ogs

I love it when pewds screams for no reason

<a href="">7:23</a> that dude probably be watching her stream hahaha

&quot;Geega Chad&quot; - Pewds
Why&#39;s his camera frame rate on 1 when he&#39;s watching the girl in the airport

What&#39;s PewDiePie&#39;s secrect to keep the eyes not being red after getting high as F...k during these 🤔

Critisizing tipping? LOL tips should be 50% - you wanna eat at a fancy restaurant and have waiters that serve you while you&#39;re acting as if they are your slaves? THAN PAY!

yea

The guy like FaceTiming someone was either trolling or just generally lovey dovey, like actual chad

The amount of nostalgia when Sive put in option c as Barrels(reference from outlast) is insane.

can someone link to a video in airport?😆

<a href="">5:07</a> best moment of my life XDDDDD

This guys a spitting image of David de gea

How do you feel that cocomelon is beating you in subs?

<a href="">2:32</a> It&#39;s like when you face 2 mirrors at each other

I hate the Okay boomer song so much it&#39;s so fucking arrogant and annoying

Senzawa Recognized “A”
<a href="">3:23</a> that’s the cat’s way of telling her she sings like a b*tch in heat.

Pewdiepie reacting the guy reacting pewds reacting him of a stream  Wow 🤣😭😂🤣

What the fuck is wrong with the camera

Me Who Can&#39;t Afford NordVPN 😓

Mama Susan isn&#39;t putting any of Pewd&#39;s vid in my subscription feed...

<a href="">7:20</a> I thought he was watching the stream.

is this vid edited? I noticed the simp part of the video isnt here anymore lol

when it got to two pewdiepies and two of the other streamer on one screen i feel like i checked out LMAO

HEHE

I’m gonna sew her that’s my last name

2022 lol ahah a
That first one is a reaction of a reaction you reacting to a vid

Pewds with short hair is hot. Sorry sorry my gay came out

I love the fact that Half of These i recognize from the smash tournament streaming community

baldipie
<a href="">07:39</a> he said “take it take it”, it's really Italian wow ahahaha
The idea of even comparing waiters not being payed a living wage and your job playing video games being funded by donations is so funny to me. Like aside from both involving money and jobs, they&#39;re two wildly, vastly different situations

It&#39;s a 4.25 hr pay before tips endless it&#39;s a locally owned company

Yes

<a href="">7:28</a> is that Evelyn Claire 😱😱

What about SVEN

your cam was laggin the whole video bro but besides that - good stuff bro 👊

nice clip bro

Eminem pewdiepie

Schadenfreude
The fact he made a better ad for pixiling than for nord vpn is killing me

bro the cameras framerate tho

I like it 👍🏼
At <a href="">7:29</a> it was my dad meeting my mom after a long 3 years of seperation but Goddamn  I never knew he is this much of a SIMP.

I am the late one I didn&#39;t know it till I watched this vid <a href="">4:25</a>

Look who&#39;s talking about Livestreams mess ups lol

<a href="">8:32</a> is so trippy lol

A youtuber reacting to a youtuber reacting to a youtuber reacting to a youtuber reacting

damn pewdiepie got that new 15 fps camera

I get the tipping one though, in america, tipping is kind of compulsory if I’m not wrong, its added to the bill or something right? While for streamers, its optional, the “customers” can choose whether to tip or not and there is no stigma against those who don’t donate

was this before the N

You gonna add the clip of you dropping the N word next time?...

The dude on the phone is probably just talking to his kids.

That was not yet a relea-

Lol the David dobrik bit 😂

Felix is the most non simp it makes me happy

<b>Flashbacks of bridge from video game</b>

Joe

<a href="">0:01</a> B!

thats cool but guess what

I love the first reaction of reacting to the  guy reacting to pewdiepie reacting to that guy

IDK if it was said, but yes people in the US make tips and a wage. Federal law says they should get paid about $2/hr if their tips plus the $2/hr is greater than or equal to minimum wage. If they don&#39;t meet that the employer is required to pay them minimum wage.

you can axcsssess

Did pewdiepie just insult me by saying I could affordit?

Is it I-KEY-AH or I-KEY-AY

I love how Pewds says &quot;so the video went viral&quot; and it has 18m views and this video has 18m views and this is not classified as going viral

Women pewdiepie is awesomePewdiepie never defend a women

<a href="">2:20</a> One of the most confusing scenes in Anime History

pewds: i have 110m subscribers!laggy facecam:  ._.

0 dislikes. This video is doing amazingly. Glad 100% of the population agrees with pewdiepie.

@pewdiepie I work in a restaurant located in Virginia, usa. We make $2.13 per hour + tips. I work 5-7 hour shifts and average $200 per shift in tips. 100% for the $2.13 go&#39;s to taxs. I don&#39;t get a check. I don&#39;t mind but it  who would turn down higher pay. The restaurant owners are the ones who benefit from the low wage for servers.

<a href="">2:25</a>pewds reacting to a guy reacting to pewds reacting to a guyIg thats 2020 youtube everybody

<a href="">7:13</a> who is that out of curiosity 😂

Pewdiepie: You know what I like, watching people suffer fansPewdiepie fans: You know what I like, watching Felix suffer.

and this started covid lol

I&#39;d rather watch pewds and make my own decisions. if i wanna go outside i will. Sigmas chose to watch pewds, take notes people

<a href="">6:45</a> if we didn&#39;t tip in the USA, Restaurants would simply have to raise prices. People make way better money from tips, especially at good restaurants, than they would with a shit salary.

Bro pewdiepie looks more like enimem than Eminem

<a href="">3:52</a> in real socialism, which Bernie would installed, she will go to work instead of making dumb videos on twitter

the worst pewds haircut. looks like something id have

<b>pewds laughs</b> bandi cam will laugh along with him

&quot;Why do you think girls always wanna talk to you&quot; lmao I promise you no woman wants to talk to a quiet guy. they think he&#39;s creepy.

<a href="">2:32</a> youtube inception

Damn.... you used to be so good Ray... delivering edgy episodes left and right... but them you became pg13 bullshit cuz u scared of ppl suing u/demonetization... u have no balls

<a href="">7:33</a> either way, its his baby on the video call with him

&quot;Goddamn. It&#39;s so catchy though&quot;senzawa appreciated that~

The reaction of a reaction of a reaction of a reaction of a reaction of a reaction (I feel like I missed a few)

For algorithm

I am commenting to get this video into the algorithm.

I loved this video! <a href="">3:20</a> &amp; <a href="">3:56</a> 😳

<a href="">7:21</a> lol

subscribe

<a href="">6:00</a> the difference is that restaurants don&#39;t depend on 2 dollar tips. They get over 90% of their money from normal orders. People donating on a stream is entirely optional, and you don&#39;t get shamed on for it.Btw I&#39;m talking abt restaurant that disrespect you if u don&#39;t give a tip.

I can confirm odablock is 5,2

<a href="">7:20</a> link plz

<a href="">10:34</a> - this final ad kills me, especially how intense &amp; crazy Felix looks when he yells, “DEAL WITH IT”, the second time.  Literally made me laugh out loud as it was expected but unexpected ... 🤪

E

I&#39;ve never seen someone reacting to a video of someone reacting to a video of someone reacting to a video until now

<a href="">2:40</a>. The “simp”toms

yes you watch this alr

shes the one recording in an airport with her doo doo smelling face

Livestream incidents <b>coughs in bridge</b>

this made me laugh so hard

All happines and joy in life comes from the sufferin and hardship of others.

<a href="">2:09</a>reaction to a reaction to a reactiongold

is anyone else getting about 15 fps?

Just think about laughing at this man in his 40s maybe 50s being all fuck the rest of the world I don&#39;t care I am who I am and he has someone who is at least interested in him. HE DID WHAT MOST NEVER ACHIEVE AND YOU LAUGH AT HIM. Just shows how judgemental and sad your life&#39;s are

Do you know the Swedish YouTuber ijustwanttobecool?

The bridge

THIS WAS A YESR AGO

is it just me or am I getting conner McGregor vibes from Felix when he had this hair

pov u came to opra gx cus of him and u have a vpn like that

<a href="">9:41</a> the guy on the facecam doesn&#39;t own that switch. He&#39;s at a smash bros tournament and that switch is owned by the tourney organiser. That player just opened the album out of curiosity.Whats funnier is the ayer then went to check the custom stages in smash on that switch which, as it turns out,  were also of similar... theming

Literally every year his English gets better

Anyone tell me the name of the Asian girl at <a href="">7:10</a> ?

first clip: Felix reacting to someone reacting to Felix reacting to someone

It’s so funny that you can see him read the script

<a href="">3:00</a>. In 10 years this will be brought up and PewDiePie will be canceled. Calling it rn

the David Dobrik impression was on point! haha

the David Dobrik impression was on point! 🤣🤣

I know i am not simp cause i jrk off to 2d girls 😏

Sven
The tipping argument is so dumbBig fucking difference between socially pushing customers to pay so you can give your employees a third of an actual salaryAnd getting money from people who send it of their own volition cause you&#39;re providing them with entertainment they don&#39;t mind paying for

Alinity is racist ?

Pewds reacting to the guy who reacts to him who reacts to the same guy.

Tipping isn&#39;t that bad, at least we save those in taxes! (depends where)

Respect to the lag

Theres a deku on the thumbnail 😭

I actually found a sponsor funny for once…

<a href="">3:22</a> or the sound of the dragon in the lord of the ring

pewds needs nord bc he doesnt want anyone to see his history lol

That advert was a fail

the quality on this video top noch

<a href="">2:34</a> WTF xD

Tipping is a means for restaurant/nightclub owners to avoid responsibility and underpay their staff, relying on their customers to do their job for them.America, take example from the smarter countries like Japan, the Netherlands and most Scandinavian ones. Assume responsibility.

I wonder how the dobrik stans are reacting knowing the can’t cancel pweds

is it just me or is pewds&#39; camera lagging at 24fps?

hi pewdiepie how are you by the way big fan love your humor you are honest
<a href="">0:50</a> Yes, but you have to pay UPFRONT for 2 years or whatever. That&#39;s what some people can&#39;t afford.

Guy reacts to women streamer pewds reacts to the guy reacting to the stream GUY reacts to pewds reacting to the guy’s reaction to the streamerPEWDS REACTS TO THE GUY REACTING TO REACTING TO PEWDS REACTING TO THE GUY REACTING TO THE STREAMER what’s next??

Streamer is not a job, you&#39;re just living with donations that you didnt deserve

<a href="">8:59</a> camera man is a legend, he has invisibility skills, ninjutsu, teleportation and most importantly he&#39;s a fuking chad.

Ah yes who doesn&#39;t remember bald pedepie

@<a href="">7:29</a> THE 02 FPS LAUGH

Who is reacting to who in the first clip??????............I am confusion

Love that part about the tipping and streamers. Fucking hypocrite got rekt

4 people on commentary.

the truth is people who make tips usually get way more than minimum wage unless they have shit personalities. and a lot of it is untaxed because they have to report the tips they get and unless managers are strict they usually let them just report a certain amount and pocket the rest.

<a href="">5:30</a> please tell me he has a youtube channel he seems funny af

What a fucking

i love you pewdiepie

I just paid 100% for NordVPN... Why didn&#39;t I watch this video sooner goshhh...

First clip had real StreamCeption vibes
<a href="">7:15</a> funniest shit acc roast the zoom got me hahah lmao

I have been subscribed for awhile but haven&#39;t watched a single video from Pewds so I am happy I started with this one.

So he&#39;s a streamer streaming while watching a streamer stream another stream while streaming a different stream by the same streamer?

Did PewDiePie do a dobrik dig with the intro for sponsor ?

pain

Pewdiepie reacts to a guy reacting to him reacting to him and the greediest streamer on twitchepic gamer moment

<a href="">5:30</a> as a shy guy I can confirm this is average shy guy behavior

pewds your cam is like lagging like slow movment in mins

You should absolutely criticize america&#39;s tipping system pewds

Pewds laughing at <a href="">7:38</a> looks like the shoe meme

re watching this &quot;bEinG ShY iS a sUpPeR PowEr&quot;

first fail is nice bcpewdiepie is reacting to somebody who reacts to pewdiepie reacting to another video

Nice

pewds cam is giving us like 3fps

<a href="">9:44</a> it wasn&#39;t actually that guys switch, it was actually the TO&#39;s switch, so whoever set up the event, had this on their switch.

i always smash the like after listening to his sponsored segments theyre funny asf

<a href="">7:30</a> plot twist: he is actually watching the stream

i love how pewds doesnt know cents

Bernie fan is synonymous with simp

<a href="">7:09</a> that moment when you get called out by Pewds

<a href="">3:50</a> I honestly think I was losing brain cells 😐

Lost my mind pepole are funny

a reaction inception

Watching it again after a year

<a href="">2:39</a> what the fuck is happening, is Pewdiepie reacting to someone that&#39;s reacting to a Pewdiepie reaction?How do I suppose to understand this?

eyyo why your webcam 2 fps

<a href="">5:03</a> Being shy is a superpower.

The camera is fucking laggy

 PewDiePie it is fucked in America because some people rely on tips because there salary is low

Nah you like barrels
<a href="">2:33</a> confused confusing confusion

pain is funny

im pretty sure this is not the first time i saw pewds reacting to someone reacting to pewds

imagine getting ur history exposed in front of ur whole class

109 Million Subs And Still Poppin That 2fps Face Cam🤣🤣🤣

He looks balding sorry cancer patients ypu have nothing on him

God DAMMIT pewds i got caught at like 12 watching this vid and now i can&#39;t use my computer

The great simp war?? I guess Sabaton has an inspiration for their new album

epic

The “he’s shy” clip is every dog owner

The guy in love: * throws kiss * Prendilo, prendilo!! (take it, take it) 🤣🤣 LMAO I promise most italians don&#39;t do that... I think xD

<a href="">1:47</a> reactception 😂😂😂

When PewDiePie said Nord VPN the quality of video dropped from 360p to 144p

Yooo, pewds liked senzawa&#39;s song!
<a href="">1:56</a> a person reacting to a person reacting to a person reacting to a video

I cringed when I saw Evelyn Claire (even though it was funny)

I work for tips and may I say it sucks. I am a bagger and some don’t tip so it’s a waste of a day so for that guy to hate on tips got what he deserves

He was reacting to someone, reacting to him, reacting to someone, react to someone else

Just so you know, unless you job is volunteer work or court mandated work(you committed a crime and you have the choice of jail time, or a certain amount of hours of work), you always get at least a minimum wage.  The thing is, tips are awesome.  The average minimum wage in America is around 12.00 per hour, and tips can easily pay more than that.

Neeko lul is so cringe yet she has so many simps

<a href="">7:23</a> the guy look like setien the fc Barcelona manager in 2018

<a href="">7:23</a> he looks like Paul McCartney

let&#39;s not forget about the bridge incident

<a href="">7:33</a> he laughed so hard that his fps dropped like the US governments reputation when Donald Trump was elected.

<a href="">9:58</a> imagine if this guy watched this videohe was applauded by pewdiepie

<a href="">2:25</a> pewdiepie reacting to streamer who then reacts to him who them reacts to him

Ree

That camera fram🌛

That streamer criticizing tipping was absolutely satisfying to watch....

Scorpio motto&quot;I have suffered, other people must suffer&quot;😆😆🦂🦂♍♍

When I was kid, I thought every foreigners are knowledge person, when I grown, when I interact with social media, I found we all are stupids.

Does David Dobrik Meme 2 days later Pewds: &quot;Well Shit..&quot;

People can get paid under minimum wage if they get enough tips to make up for it

<a href="">7:55</a> they got your ass on camere! This shit it’s in 4K

Potatoes
Are you from illuminati

He is watching him watching her doing the watching of watching her watching pewdiepie watch him...

This was a bit confusing :-D Sometimes I forgot who was reacting to who, lol

In case you are wondering the cameraman’s number is no longer active

The first one is like .... Reaction to Reaction to Reaction to a video &amp; I&#39;M watching it !!

Why so much asking for likes and sponsors all over the place did I miss something

It happened, I just watchend a reaction to a reaction to a reaction to a video.

Pewdiepie: laughsFrame rate: Adios

<a href="">7:31</a> wait the dude on the back is talking Italian

How ironical

He really called his sponsor boring and they still paid him. Thats alpha moves

thats a paradox! <a href="">2:20</a>

It all so confusing for me Bebe brein

Ok, but tipping a restaurant worker AFTER already paying the restaurant is pretty different than a twitch sub.

She copystriked her cat

If someone gives EXEMPLARY service and you WANT to tip them then it&#39;s your prerogative. But requiring tipping is taxation without representation. -.-

Yea live stream fails remember the bridge lmao

I thought this was today.....

ooOOOOooo clip opTIoN

Jesus this video came out almost a year ago. Felt like I watch this video just yesterday.

That guy with that blue beanie looked like skittles eminems long lost brother

Matthew 3:2......

Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon.......

If people make less than minimum wage in tips than the restaurant has to pay them minimum

That cat fucking hates her

Simp-basically <a href="">4:17</a>

@PewDiePie i typed in the code PewdiedafgPie and it didn&#39;t work

Checked the sources, found out all are down except Okay Boomer.

You get a low wage as a waiter but you get pretty much all the tips (split amongst your coworkers). But you know who works for tips and tips alone in America? Strippers. No joke.

<a href="">2:20</a> Pewdiepie reacting to a guy reacting to Pewdiepie reacting to the guy. I&#39;d like to see the reaction of the guy to this

Ok

Biggest youtuberContent: Sponsor.Reactions with a camera, with 3 fps.

no hate but why is pewdiepie lagging

What does Pewdiepie like?A. Identical CommentsB. SvenC. BarrelsD. Watching people sufferE. Nothing

Ya know every cat I&#39;ve ever had just scratch you when annoyed or makes a jester. I&#39;ve never seen one move and bite a person.

<a href="">2:23</a> steamer streams streamer that streamed him streaming streaming himself while the streamer is streaming the stream that showed the streamer streaming the stream of the streamer that was streaming

every other youtubers: the most generic and borings ad sponsorspewdiepie: makes me laugh

Any other
<a href="">3:51</a> amazing how rhe singer of that song is now this little blue gremlin

<a href="">7:12</a> idk y but i feel like she&#39;s irl mizuhara she just gives off that vibe

He was literally punching the air in the PUBG gameplay

<a href="">1:59</a> the best moment you could ever seeThe viewers [react] to Felix [react] to a streamer [react] to felix [react] to a girl [react] to s.o else

pewds: &quot;i like to watch people suffer&quot;me: &quot;T-T that&#39;s wrong man T-T&quot;my head: &quot;I kind of like watch people like that maybe he&#39;s my lost twin&quot;

hmm pewds profile pic looks exaclty like him but thinner

was waiting for the casual n word

<a href="">2:26</a> is it confusing for you as well??

This is basically pewds reacting to a guy reacting to pewds reacting to the same guy

<a href="">5:30</a> i like the shy guy not the loudmouth her boyfriend a second later

Why is your camera on 12fps?

Well I was nordvpn I would never sponsor him again

<a href="">4:43</a>

<a href="">2:21</a> Inception

Is that a reaction of a reaction reacting to a reaction? <a href="">2:08</a>

Now is it legal to watch Netflix with VPN? I got mixed feelings

Cmon man the airport one is wholesome

Pewdiepie <a href="">10:26</a> oda is my fav

<a href="">4:02</a> It’s confirmed Bernie got 99% of the simp vote

I really hope Twitch ban Alinity for her poor treatment of cats. I know it doesn’t really relate to the video the Alinity clip just reminded me. Twitch needs to stop simping and start using their brain

It makes me genuinely happy to watch the cat get revenge for Alinity for all the times she has abused her cats

UH, THATS FUNNY -pewdiepie like 5 times
The bite sound was 10/10

If you want to do david dobrik ad you have to take a bunch of laxitives first then wait until you&#39;re on the cusp of shitting yourself so bad all you want to do is talk as fast as possible so you can finish and run to the nearest trash can to unload.

I am LegendStarring: David
This is his job.

<a href="">4:19</a> I&#39;VE NEVER HEARD OF IT lol

<a href="">3:50</a> Looking at this now, Pewdiepie was pretty close to playing with Neeko in Among Us, perhaps he even did in a stream I didn&#39;t catch.Neeko is in 100 Thieves, like Valkyrae, Courage and Brooke whom he actually played with.

<a href="">7:43</a> maybe he was  talking to his little kid and wife? and he was just playing with his little baby?

2020 really was a bad year

Tipped workers earn a couple dollars an hour but they get tips which incentivizes hard work and making sure that you are polite to the customer, plus if you are decent you most likely will earn way more than minimum wage depending on the day

The friendly starter systemically spell because caption optionally entertain failing a accessible cousin. rhetorical, zonked note

Ugh the fake laughs piss me off

You know you have a life in &quot;real life&quot; when 99% of what he says and 99% of what you see makes no sense to you and you have no idea why or what he&#39;s laughing at. I&#39;ve heard of the &quot;Pewd...&quot; name but I&#39;m not subbed or watch him so WHY is this in my recommended?  Nothing makes sense.

Anyone else like to pretend they&#39;re pewds friend while reacting? No just me, alright

What do you like?Watching people sufferSven .-.

In the U.S. wages have been stagnated since the 1980s, meaning that while production has skyrocketed amongst the workers the ones pocketing the profits are the richest people in the country. What&#39;s worse is that they&#39;ve convinced the population to believe that raising their wages would be bad for everyone.

Felix now looks like the child of Eminem and DJ Khaled if Cocaine was involved

What does PewDiePie like?C: Barrels

<a href="">2:20</a> woah this is like some kinda Back to the Future shit

Felix&#39;s camera FPS fell like the world economy.

Pew react to some guy react to pew react to some girl

Identical comment....

I just realized I watched a guy watching a guy watching a guy watching a guy watching a girl

<a href="">7:03</a> wonder what that guy is doing during the pandemic

Waiters in the US get a hourly salary and tips from customers

Bridge

The biggest fail is <b>look in the mirror</b>

Bald

Pewdception

I did not know this was a pewdiepie video so I thought  this was a compilation so when I saw pewds in the start I was confused

<a href="">2:10</a>Can we all take a moment to appreciate that video ception we are witnessing ?

This guy has 107 million subscribers? Wtf 😂

<a href="">5:16</a> lmao

IDK why but I just die when watching the part about the streamer&#39;s height. I&#39;ve probably watched it 30 or 40 times but every time I absolutely laugh my ass off.

Tipping can get you a night better than your wages if you&#39;re lucky enough, its the risk of working that job.

NORDvpn leaks DNS...

This is the first time in my youtube life that I didn&#39;t skip the  ad

i was once a king of simps

<a href="">7:24</a> that guy wasn&#39;t talking to someone he was just watching pokimane.

TRUMP 2020

Hey pewdiepie wat happened on the bridge

His best intro: PewDiePie:  You know what I like? Watching people suffer.

<a href="">2:00</a>  We are literally watching a reaction video of a reaction video of a reaction video......We need to go deeper.

<a href="">7:34</a> Italian power ahah

The tipping situation is dogshit 😂 I’m not a streamer so I can criticize it. Saves restaurants a margin amount of cash. Shitty system that shouldn’t exist. I am already paying for my food, why tf do I have to give someone money when all they did was bring it out to me? I’d go out back and get it myself if it means I could save $10 without having the manager come out and ask me what’s wrong. What’s wrong is that you pay your servers $2 an hour and leave it up to the customers to decide whether or not they get to pay rent this month. So shitty. I never tip and never will lol

<a href="">7:22</a> Yo is that Evelyne Claire ? 😂😂😂

Tf happened to his cam xD

The Simp Bernie girl looked like Lionel Messi on Faceapp at first glance

It depends on if your good as a waiter some people make a lot more then they would even Makin 15 an hour but personally that kinda shit would be too stressful for me

Pewds laughed so hard his framerate of his camera dropped

<a href="">05:06</a> best clip
the first one was a stream within a stream within a stream. 5 levels of streaming . INCEPTION

<a href="">1:45</a> thank me later
