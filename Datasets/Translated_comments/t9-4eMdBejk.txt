Pewds should of started his own YouTube.

And now YouTube has a new CEO who will run the company to the ground and the creators within the platform.

Holy fuck, he was still so edgy back here. I think corona really held back his creative powers and with the fact that he himself tried to become more family friendly, it really came out and is still coming out as stale content. Still, his old stuff is freaking entertaining.

Great Video

&quot;he should be more responisble&quot; he is one singular dude. he can&#39;t know and research everything. the king on the netherlands has a lot of controversies lately and he has a whole team and a prime-minister who has to sign of on everything so how is felix supposed to do this? also, anyone under the age of 14 should not be allowed on social media, and even then, not alone

<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/dv90XtfhAurw8gTgzar4DA"></a> Love you! Felix is the best! PewDiePie is the best YouTuber in the world!

2 year anniversary

all gun companies need to rename guns to pew pew sticks

their policy is totally wrong and I know of people who are basically removed from or terminated from YouTube for absolutely no legitimate reason. I&#39;ve seen comments of mind disappear for really no legitimate reason. But God bless you and God bless you too anyway and remember that Jesus loves you very much. Peter the pumpkin eater

You are great but I don't understand English
I missed the old comments. It forced me to see the videos, so i can explore, because i dont pick the explore page... Now i have to. I also missed the collumn version of videos which makes the thumbnail look small, it made seeing the thumbnail annoying.

Felix should make his own platform separate from YouTube with complete freedom of speech, and no demonetization

this update section makes me want to kill myself

we need to remove the people controlling yt and replace them

.

Well, you know. Broadening the definition of unacceptable behavior with no increase in the number of people enforcing the rules is a cherished tradition that goes back hundreds, or maybe thousands of years.

How do you get so many subscribers

I DISLIKED THIS VID IT WAS TERRIBEL

YOU SUCK

Vinegar Blatt
wefeteq

It&#39;s even worse now. Depressing...
This man is on the top of youtube and hes legit is roasting youtube thats when you know its bad

pewdiepie is a good boy

The new update in youtube 2020 is soooooo trash the comment is moved.

1 like = Many time PewDiePie said the word doubt

^O^

onece i was in the same minecraf would as pewdiepie

YoTube Poop.??????

What....?

YOUTUBE IS BAD!!!!

Watch dinosaur bay
nice video pewdipie i appreciated it
Wow Ilikes your videos sir... good ide

I beg you I have a games channel, I hope for your support

Hate almost every time they update format. I haven&#39;t updated since last year.

We need to start a youtube movement to help pull out YouTube&#39;s stick in their ass..

YouTube Is Going To Be Dead By The End Of This Year.

You’d expect with all these new updates, YOUTUBE WOULD ADD A LOOP BUTTON!

T series sucks
T series sucks

Don't be afraid of those subscribers
nose hair game is strong

Bro i cant litrally find new channels to watch

YouTube is obviously a bunch of facists lol.

YouTube new update disables chat profiles verification.  Now you can&#39;t see who you&#39;re talking to

hi

Worst channel ever
I can’t belive this man has 100 million subs

The real way that America works is if the idiot media doesn’t like someone, they basically try to convince the country to hate them with false information. That is the real reason that they make fun of Donald Trump so much.

What is your opinion about india please telll me pewdipie

Anyone else find the name Youtube ironic

I subscribed to you on 28 different accounts

The channel style and effects look like Luba's
I think what they mean by public figures is &quot;people that are widely known&quot; that everyone knows. Because I know people who aren&#39;t on the internet very much so they don&#39;t know social media public figures but they know common public figures, like Trump  (featured as the public figure in the video)

he was unhappy

Gokanaru

.

cool the video
PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then 🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪

pew is smart or should i say...       BIG BRAIN sorry XD

HOW ABOUT GOING TO ANOTHER PLATFORM?????

His name is Gokanaru, ily pewds but we both know you should of credited himn

The soviet Union would be proud of yt

I'll be the only one to comment in Spanish on things I don't. Hahaha now I'm sure they don't understand me at all except if you're a boss and know Spanish capooooooo pewdiepie I don't understand you hahahahahahahahaha
Hissssss

When I first heard of this channel, I thought it was called:PiNKie Pie

We need leafy back 

pewds should buy YouTube, the platform would be better for creators(Just joking, chill out)

youtube beeg pp themsmol pp nwo.

PS4 name Sans_Spaghetti buy alien bodysuit and send a pic on ps4 do join rumpo clan.

Came here to support Gokanaru. He deserved better than he got.

its swedish vinesauce.

I CANT CHANGE THE NOTIFICATION BELL CAH APPARENTLY IM TOO YOUNG TO DO THAT WTF IS YOUTUBE SMOKING IM 16 FFS AND I CANT CHANGE THIS

Just pointing out, if we&#39;re going to credit Idubbz for his Leafy Content Cop, then we should probably also credit Gokanaru for his Death of H3H3: Video Vigilante. Seems fair, and it&#39;s quite odd that people who have been covering this haven&#39;t been crediting him for what was his most viewed video on his channel.

Now the new Update is about us not being able to comment and play the video in a miniscreen mode if that video is a &quot;Kids&quot; thing,  im pissed

No credit to gokanaru?

please I beg you. do something. my favorite channels create so many good videos but when one of their video is getting alot of views and they get alot of subs, YouTube demonetizes the videos and then their views tank. please. I know you have a heart... please.

disappointed you couldnt shout out gokanarus video. did the laziest most cowardly coverage of it.

it really feels more about silencing smaller creators in Gokanaru&#39;s case.

The creator who made The Death Of H3H3 is Gokanaru, almost all of the youtubers who mentioned that video wont say his name for some reason.

<b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b><b>The H3 critic&#39;s name is Gokanaru.</b>

This is why Scandinavians are the scariest next to N Koreans. At least they still have a real meaning. You’re not showing well the purpose of anarchy. You like attention, but not really interesting accept that you’re popular

This is my first ever PewDiePie video, and I&#39;m kind of let dumb founded.This guy is famous? For being boring as a slug.This not an attack on him. In any form.I&#39;m just feeling so cringyyy after watching this.

That&#39;s the thing with Coppa and the Youtube Kids situation.. It&#39;s actually flawed because certain things can just be bypassed especially cartoons that are a bit mature.. in example i was making a small test.. Ebichu had slipped into the kids animations.. And it&#39;s an adult themed cartoon from japan which includes some sexual references..

Kids at school said sub to pew die pie so I said ok and did I thought you were weird but your not

All Glory to GOD

I don't speak English
Goood Gamers Good Gamers

I unsubscribed from YouTube due to this sort of stuff.

Best

Why does this guy have so many subs.  I don&#39;t get it at all.  There&#39;s thousands of other guys doing exactly what he does with about 1,000 subs.

RIP PewDiePie4.29.2010 - 1.15.2020
How does he have so many subs!?!??!?!?

the problem is that vids (SOMEHOW!!!!!) for kids, got rid of comments, saving vids, and more, THIS IS DUMB, most vids that anyone could comment on it was not classified for kids now are?!

Tana Mongeu got the award, she hasn’t done shit for YouTube or its community except fake videos. MrBeast helped fund a multi million dollar tree donation service.

I don&#39;t understand why PewDiePie doesn&#39;t have hisOWN platform...???100 MILLION subs and you haven&#39;t made your ownPrivate platform...!!???

Don&#39;t entirely agree with his views about that thumbnail. If a thumbnail showed a guy about to shoot felix it would come off as atleast a bit threatening even if that intent wasn&#39;t there.

THIS IS SO TRUE!!! <a href="">10:44</a>

face

I’m reading the news!

Yo, he just called out Onision!!

Get the hint youtube! you cant save yourself with policies anymore, your gonna have to fix something and fast!

Youtubers have a cultural system

How bout every make a new apk at playstore that is for 13+/16+ So youtube can be a kids apk(Just my idea)

Pewnews is becoming the very thing he hates. Jsut jumping on everything

If you have a problem with the public media rules, you go try and achange

So basically this prevents major gossip and toxic youtubers lol

Pewdiepie want say goodbye youtube
YouTube noob

Noob

Youre Gold man. Humor all good Beautiful. But these discerning straight up spitting facts and objectivity are too

<a href="">4:41</a> facts

This is an awesome call out video!

COPPA is mean

You deserve a time out, but a year later? You sure you can hold on that long?

Don’t worry! I’ll explain it to you! I got this!!! ... it’s all bullshit

Funny as he is, he&#39;s speaking simple logical truths.

ok

Behooooooooooooooooooold

Lol the description is YouTube stinky.        AmAzInG felix

If pewdiepie went to bitchute the fandom would follow.

Hi

COPPA is RUINING YOUTUBE

COPPA should be focused on <b>YOUTUBE KIDS</b>

Youtube made a big oof on its new update, IT PAUSES THE MINIPLAYER WHEN YOU WANT TO WATCH THE VIDEO AND BROWSE VIDEOS AUTOMATICALLY!! <b>[TRIGGERED]</b>

They turned off mobile miniplayer for“Kids video”

You can always just transition to redtube

I knew you wouldn&#39;t be called a kids channel LMAO

<b>YouTube, more like YouPoop</b>- YT trends
big brain
if he would&#39;ve just named onision then he would threaten to sue pewdiepie and all the 9-year-olds would probably speed up his downfall and get his ass thrown in jail

Props for adds good job felix

YouTube is a 13 year old who&#39;s hair it doesn&#39;t know what to color

Youtubers should just buy YouTube

So someone smart start developing a new and better version of YouTube not called YouTube.

His hand kept disappearing in the side of the green screen or whatever it is 

BIG BRAIN.

Pewd is alt-right.

Any new  active youtubers ?? Let&#39;s grow together <b>_</b>

where my crowder fans at

<a href="">00:01</a>

Pewdiepie WOKE....his name contains die so his channel will be terminated

Pewdiepie for CEO of YouTube, MrBeast for COO and Markiplier and Jacksepticeye for Senior Executives

The sound that plays when he curses is cancer to my ears :(

E

Pewdiepie if you’re seeing this, please say something about the Suzy Lu situation. She can’t take criticism and has been abusing false copyright strikes on every person who criticized her. Not to mention she would apparently fight TV Tokyo in court to prove her ‘innocence’ over using anime episode in her reaction videos. I feel like this needs the attention from bigger youtubers like yourself to get some sense into her. Pls 

Follow your follower from Iraq please translate your words into Arabic Thank you  and excuse me if some of the mistakes I make

He probably didnt say onisions name outright at <a href="">3:41</a> because onision would immediately strike the video

X

Intent exists in all areas of our legal systems its a strong pillar in conviction. Intent can be judged.

It&#39;s okay Pewds. You freaking DESERVE a break!!! Go enjoy yourself! We will be here when you come back!

If you watch this stoned all the edits start to seizure

Susan needs to step down and pewds should replace her.

I just wanna say that it’s pretty cool how you post videos everyday and they’re all interesting for the most part. Big pp energy.

“Public” in this context means government

In the future, pressing the dislike button is considered bullying 

Youtube his China It suppress freedom and expression

I will dislike every Pewdiepie vid until he stops using the same god damn thumbnail

It&#39;s really smart for him to not say onisions name cause otherwise he&#39;s gonna try to copystrike it, onion boy seriously needs helps though

<a href="">9:21</a> is it just me or is poppy smoria lying. biggest inside job ever???

I like this meaty content right here!

Behind the YouTube videos and YouTubers doing their jobs, you can see that YouTube is on fire

k but MAKE BEBE!

Harrassment rules are the big gay

Yy

my 2020 is going to be boring WTF!!

HAHAHHAHAHAHA You donate to the ADL and then do the pikachu face when YouTube brings up &quot;hate speech&quot;.

Pewds: I’m taking a break from YouTube next yearMe: He’s having Bebe question mark?

Who edit this video. ? Wat

This is the way

they remind me of happy days I the gulag

I like boiled eggs

I subed fro Mr.beast to you

Wait... How the fuck did pewdiepie FaceTime Mr.Beast if he had Android. You disgraced Android race <a href="">4:10</a>

So... that means we can ridicule Susan Wojcicki because she’s the CEO of YouTube, right?

PewTube please

YouTube is harrasing me with their biased algorithms on the main page. Where are all my right wing conspiracy channels?

At least pewds tells us he’s leaving unlike my dad

You know what else makes creators less inclined to share opinions? Idk... probably fucking BANNING THEM.

Daddy of five had another kid by the way

who else is kind of questioning pewdiepie&#39;s voice..?

Yt rewind next year <b>NO PERSON WATCH CUZ THEY ARE GO OUT FROM YT NOW IM QUIT FROM YOUTUBE</b>

You need a break boy. It is shown. Love how you try to keep it real

Clearly YouTube needs to read up on the united states&#39; ex post facto policy

Nuance is dead.

I&#39;m so proud felix is the number one youtuber because clearly he cares about the community, the platform. i don&#39;t think T-Series a massive corporate would care about COPPA, about new policy that deleted Content Cop - Leafy, a fucking historical video. im just happy that our leader is a funny, genuine guy and he deserves a break too. don&#39;t be too much of a weeb when you move to tokyo felix, love you.

I should report this to YouTube just so they have to listen to some feedback

YouTube is a place to voice thoughts and opinions, without having bias from people silencing you. Steven crowder is allowed to voice his opinion. So stupid.

Shout out

Freedom of speech no matter what it is

Who here loves Steven crowder and got excited seeing him in a pewds video

<b>YOUTUBE JUST UPDATE YOUR ASTHETICS PLEASE! DONT DO ANYTHING ELSE</b>

YouTube more like You(if you are family friendly, highly monetizable and don’t bully)Tube

Welp, guess I’m gonna watch Dailymotion from now on... 

Pewds should have a podcast

Anyone else want to say goodbye before this app gets destroyed by coppa

YIUR SO RIGHT
Need a break Pewds, then take a break. :) You deserve it.

Press T to Respect pewds and hate you tube workers

It&#39;s because of the cumbucket boomers managing YouTube that I&#39;m slowly but surely stopping myself to use the platform. There&#39;s other options, and they&#39;re gonna get better if people start moving out from YouTube to those.

Oop-

Hello humans who read this.I am asking for a big favour, as I am trying to get in contact with Pewdiepie (Felix) because I have a business idéa I think he would be interested in.I am Swedish aswell as Felix and want to discuss a business idéa with him, but it is very hard to get in contact with him or his &quot;manager&quot; or whatever I need to in order to have a chance of him reading what I have to say.Christmas is here in 2 hours and all I really wish is to forward a Email to him explaining my idéaThis is as random as it gets but I am desperately trying to get in contact with him so I am now trying every way possible.Just 5 minutes with him or his manager would mean the world to me, I know many people probably try to do this but my idéa is very big and can affect the internet in a good way since a new youtube era is here.I really dont know what else to write other than this is my biggest dream and it would be an honor to atleast get an Email that he could read.Best regards, Alex from South of Sweden.

Elon Musk needs to make an alternative to Twitter and YouTube

Google itself will disable your account in a heartbeat. I’m currently fighting that on my other, main account. This is a backup one I hadn’t used in forever. If you even mess up and violate on of their hundreds of policies in their terms of service agreement they will boot you out, not explain why, then delete your account. I’ve heard of people fighting to get their account back because all their photos and documents are on there. Sure you can say they should have backed them up elsewhere but people aren’t perfect and shouldn’t be that harshly punished for it, google lead them to believe they could be trusted, and it’s easy to forget to back up all your stuff all the time on your own hard drive.  Many of them didn’t even do anything. They hadn’t even been using their account and it was shut down and they can’t get back in while the clock clicks towers deletion. Even if they did mess up they should be told how and given some way to fix it. You should get three strikes you’re out, or more than one random, unexplained strike leading to severe punishment.You know PewDiePie will get a timely response to any of his requests. The rest of us I think they just burn the email as it comes in, or the entire computer. Just put it through a computer sized shredder and start up a new one. All this stupid people trying to get critical parts of their lives back, you’d think we drastically effected their digital lives by our unexplained actions.(As a tip don’t trust your photos, documents, and so on to google. Back everything up at all time. Some of the people are dealing with sick kids while google is randomly trying to shut their account down and won’t give them access to pictures of their family and kids and stuff they can’t get back. I don’t have photos but it’ll be a pain beyond measure rebuilding password, playlists, bookmarks and so on.)

Next content cop is on youtube itself

We are all public figures on any sort of social or online media PERIOD! you are out there.. if and it doesn’t matter if you are big or small. You are still pretty public if anyone from any country or place can take a look at you online! Youtube is bs

You Tube live, you, you

Youtube is a delusional cooperation

<a href="">3:41</a> talking about onision

Well said pewdiepie <a href="">3:07</a>

You dumbYou losePermanently

Youtube stinky

we need leafy

I think by ‘public figures’ US law means people in public office such as legislatures, federal or state executive offices, things like that. Celebrities are considered ‘private figures’ in that they don’t hold office and/or are private citizens.

then youtube literally should ban EVERY trash rap and pop songs

Gonna have to start using &quot;branded in an iron fork&quot; instead of &quot;set in stone&quot; now lmao

YouTube: I-Pewds: <b>DOUBT</b>

man that buzz sound..my ears...my tintintytintytintisisisis

I got flagged for children’s content I’m pissed off

i love how pewds doesn’t dare give greg any clout

Vietnam

amazing VID! Absolutely right, the users of youtube will do the best job at governing the content that gets created

Why around the eight minute mark does it look like he is crying. Dude he ok, is he a victim of coopa

The romans invented something calling Satire. Satire is literally making fun of public figures

I’m sad that pewdiepie seems upset.  I hope everything works out with YouTube so that pewdiepie isn’t so upset.

<a href="">6:44</a> facts

Everyone should start moving to other content platforms that don&#39;t do this type of stuff. If such a platform doesn&#39;t exist, then we should just make one.

Ok you gus you channel cool lol
When I realise I have fricking 10 pewds vids <b>well, here we go again!</b>

You know a YouTuber cares about you if they edit the video good and have a reasonable amount of ads.This is an example of PewDiePie. HE CARES ABOUT US

At least Pewds gives a warning that he’s leaving unlike my dad

twitter is worse.

Marzia is praying
My heart grew three times its normal size when Pewds was talking about a certain degenerate.   You can tell he&#39;s got genuine feelings towards the issue but keeps it classy still.  Hat tilt to you, sir.  Also,  TAKE A BREAK!  You more than deserve it and it&#39;s long overdue.  Your 9 year olds will stay loyal!

found the best channel ever  pewdiepie is better but this channel is so good it is called recuscite community

I found the best channel ever  pewdiepie is better but this channel is so good it is called recuscite community

Hahaha funny
Okay.... Who the hell searches for Pewds in Pronhub?.?

why is this 4 hours ago?

Let&#39;s do the same thing to Youtube that we did to Sonic

<b>told you yt is poop</b>

hi, ppl in 2021..i know you&#39;re looking for timetraveller, HERE I AM  ;)

What is YouTube means

Thank God I’m crawling from here! Step by step.

F YouTubes policy start a boycott
ready to move forward. ya youtubers gotta find a new platform. the fans will follow

Due to the new outro, I must make sure I finish eating before he video ends. Lol!

Filming videos and moving to japan seems like way to much doing at the same time!

...

5.2 mil views in a dayNot on trendingNice YouTube

Have you seen the critikal video, have you?

Pewdiepie, I think you should create a platform like youtube but without all things that have transformed it in a place where creators can’t create what they want

You tube has an agenda, and the elections are coming up.  This is their solution.

Me at 12: just one more videoMe at 4 am: God damn it

Youtube: Let&#39;s make this website for kids and spread positivity...<b>IN THE MOST IRONIC WAY POSSIBLE</b>

Pewdiepie needs to start his own platform

First the queen and now the king... we are gonna miss you, but we stand by your side!

I am oj super cool and I am beginning to view my YouTube videos

PewDiePie .. yes , he is the man . He is the best on earth  With very hard and good work. I just offer for everybody for follow him all the time. You can learn lot from PewDiePie.. WELL DONE 

Set up a BitChute channel dude, seriously do it and let this place go down the toilet since they are desperate to flush themselves.

Youtube sells out to corporations and pisses on creators when the first ad-pocalypse happend it showed who youtube really cares about

:(

It&#39;s hard to get anywhere on YouTube if youre just starting out and have garbage content

<a href="">3:43</a> Who is the person that Pewds won&#39;t name?

YouTube: You criticized us.... enjoy your demonitization.
We need a petition to make Felix in charge of YouTube

lol he was definitely talking about onision

when pewds mentioned greg and calls his bullshit out 

Lol the vox guy those arent homosexual mannerisms. Those are just rabid explainy hands.

Freedom workZ
Late night shows get a pass because they got the moneeyyyyyyyyyy.

If a vid isn&#39;t kid friendly, then don&#39;t let them watch it! Aren&#39;t ppl screening what their kids watch?!

Tyiiyxyidii

Why does YouTube have it&#39;s own gun in its mouth?

Hi

<a href="">9:50</a> theres that one video that she tells u to sub to pewds and then flashes her tita

“Youtube did a oopsie” more like youtube is a oopsie

I actually miss Leafy.

Just saying bro...You have 102 000 000+ (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) followers, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s about time to establish PewTube?

Nooo without you pewds my days are gonna suck

Sucks Mr Beast didn&#39;t win. I wanted to know which of those creators you thought was good besides him. Great stuff. I&#39;ll miss you but hope you enjoy your break. You deserve it!

So no more Discord predator  vids?
Enjoy break
Youtube: if u harass yters ur in troubleScrubby: welp...

Please just critique other channels. It is your job as king.

You’re gonna get taken down for harassing YouTube.

YouTube is WAY too far left. As a huge corporation, they should be sitting their ass smack dab in the middle

Youtube BAD!!!!

leafy 2020 election

The internet has made it a bit &quot;easier&quot; for kids to get their education elsewhere - compared to traditional schooling that is. If you want to learn anything, you can do so with just a few clicks now and in a way, you have more freedom to develope yourself a bit more organically and independently. Why is this important and relvant to Youtubes new policies? School was designed to brain wash kids - seriously. The goal was to train people as you would with animals and it became a social experiment based off skinnerian methods and other devious methods. Everyones identity was basically herded together so that you were easily monitored and controlled which explains exactly why youtube (google) is changing their rules. Behavorists play a huge role in our society and I dont doubt that youtube is doing the same now and it&#39;s all targeting kids because kids are basically sponges to their surroundings and environment and it is when they&#39;re young that they are suceptible to being sculpted.With millions of kids visiting youtube every day, that&#39;s another way to manipulate the mass and creators/teachers have to play by the new rules to help with such agenda. Currently reading, &quot;Deliberate Dumbing Down of American by Charlotte Iserbyt,&quot; If anyone is interested...

YouTube wants to remove the control of YouTube away from its creators. When you say that YouTubers criticize other YouTubers to sort of &quot;get in line&quot; in appeal to common decency or reason, this is a great example of that process that changes YouTube. YouTube doesn&#39;t like that one bit, nor does the press that YouTube likes to adhere to so badly, even if it means a loss of profits. Isn&#39;t that interesting? Could we then say, by extension, that the press has some control over YouTube?

why the hell youtube attacked my short cartoon video it’s clean no cussing I named don’t watch this!! It I was speaking on the nwo and a website that it was being shared on kicked me off the site this crazy man

They meen joking is ok but harassment is not yes!!!!

Lol funny Poppy Smoria funny PewNews I liked this video yes!!!!

For the public figure thing, here in America it’s actually by law

I still can’t believe Poppy Borger was fired

Elon musk must create youtube 2.0

YouTube making new policy’s make it less available to share other opinions

Youtube bad

If you came from tik tok like
Maybe Pewdiepie will make an App like Youtube???

<b>DOUBT</b>

Poopie-doopie
PewTube make it happen!!

Beginning of the Decade: Poppy HarlowEnd of the Decade:Poppy Smoria

They will never leave US alone till were gone...Rip US that has Channels.....

When Pewdiepies city back ground is VERY similar to NCS blank background 

People need to drink cement and harden the fuck up.

Pewdiepie is helping me to live......

Yo peds, remember who is paying you 

YouTube stopped being <b>You</b> Tube along time ago sadly... This harassment policy is made up to attract corporations to a more “friendly” page so they can advertise their stuff here.

EVERY YOUTUBER EVER: the copyright system is messed up and seriously needs fixedYouTube: we listened to creators and updated our harassment policyYouTubers: what wait no

So if I go to any video on YouTube and write a comment that calls for violence in any way the creator of the video get punished??? Great job thinking that all the way through YT.

Felix, to me Youtube is like a fruit: beautiful and magnificent at first glance, then it rots away over time. It&#39;s become garbage and i just don&#39;t care at this point... I&#39;m watching videos anyway.

Love your work Felix... go out in a flaming Fricking wreck =]

Well so, if create a video about &quot;Home Alone&quot;, does that little actor make my video &quot;for kids&quot; because there is a kid in it? 

youtube is becoming to kid-friendly lmao

Pewdiepie the voice of reason in times of chaos.

Thank you for not saying his name Pewds, you&#39;re a good man.  He doesn&#39;t need more exposure.

How many subscribers can i have with 0 videos i would really like to beat your 102 million subs with 0 videos lol

I miss leafy
Anarchy? Did someone summon me? Lmao this shit makes me ALMOST glad my pc is out of commission and I can&#39;t record again until my real job starts paying me more than 8 bucks an hour so y&#39;know I can actually afford my trash hobby. Anyway, forreal though can youtube PLEASE get their shit together? This is obnoxious.

420 thumbs up !

YES LEAFY COME BACK️
I&#39;m glad that he didn&#39;t name the person who creators have been calling out and calling for Youtube to ban. He doesn&#39;t need any more popularity.  He&#39;s got Chris Hansen &amp; the FBI coming for his ass.  And for those of you naming him in the comments, shame on you.

Thanks for heads up.

Can we all just agree youtube is a shitty app now? There are still amazing and entertaining youtubers that are being ruined because they wont allow them to have freedom of speech and shit like that, they better change their shit or youtube is fucked!

YouTube should just back up away from us be sure we have eyes and ears on all mean and or stupid content. We got it down

U can take as long a break as u want. (Just not too long) don’t like so pewds sees in New. Lol

Pewdddss!! I understand, the 19 year olds will wait for you

WTF

x

When does YouTube not have a fucking flaw?

John Oliver did that video recently about SLAPP suites, and how bad they can be. All throughout that video he &quot;bullies&quot; bob Murray.Youtubes definition of bullying is to loose.

A New Site Like YouTube Can Be Called PewTube   No More Ads

Sup

From an American legal standpoint, yes all youtubers should be public figures. They hold themselves out on a media platform

Stop harassing YouTube

Wow the &quot;venom&quot; ad before this video represents Trump and the Republican parts...    Biting heads off evil bad guy democrats. And letting em role down the street like a &quot;turd in the wind&quot;.. M.A.G.A

Yehbbbb llllllllllllllllllll
And lol, how come he has over a million followers
I&#39;m sad.....please don&#39;t go uwu

&quot;No implied threats&quot;, quid pro quo? Lol

youtube have to much power we need other sites

Start your own website and call it Pewtube.

YouTube is the China of the internet

True

I think COPPA and FTC should make a channel so Youtube can demonitize it

You tube should listen to its king

PewDiePie, russian like you vidovs (i m russian my english very bad) pls no I don’t know the word don’t leave in English on youtube
Yes and not ran by 99% democrats who selectively pick on who can harass who

Im guessing his old headphones are more comfortable then the new release

Sullivan vs New York Times is the ruling for the American media btw

youtube is being stinky

Yea will never get into the tube &quot;channel wise&quot; but opinionated motivated status: YouTube is shutting down inspirational tubers who use there freedom of speech to influence the audience and that&#39;s a big no no in the eyes of the media&quot; power and influence&quot; Is key in today society of toxic influences that has to be corrected by the level headed tubers (you, idubbbz and actually channels that I care to watch cause im stoned) so if you remove them from the equation its just less shit to involve. Now the tubers that are just in the game for the fame on the other hand won&#39;t be censored threw those ridiculous rules but of course they won&#39;t remove their content either unless called upon by the &quot;content cop&quot; and is needed cause there&#39;s ppl who apparently don&#39;t know a joke if it hit them in the face....literally...anyways yea doubt anyone will trip if I leave this comment here so enjoy if so just remove it not a big deal

where are all the russians
Dont leave me please. I swear I’ll kill myself

To help you understand about the ridicule of public figures is youtube is filled with liberals liberal hate trump so any ridicule on trump or any Republican is okay any on liberals is not okay

Youtube bans or eliminates normal videos or channel for bad words but it doesn’t on spam or visual content videos which i believe are reported a lot of times. Nice work youtube!

There is a reason that it is allowed for someone to ridicule a public figure specifically. It is a legally protected act. Early in American history, starting with newspapers making cartoon caricatures of presidential candidates, people were subject to retaliation when expressing criticism of public office holders. In order to prevent retaliation by powerful officials, who didn&#39;t care for being humiliated, It was deemed to be a legally protected action. It is now viewed as an extension of freedom of speech and freedom of the press in America. Giving the people the explicit right to make fun of office holders without fear of legal retaliation. Merica!

Totally agree with Pewds, you should be able to criticize YouTubers without fear of penalty. Just want to clarify (not justify the new rule), I believe &quot;public figures&quot; refers to folks who work on behalf of the government, like a President, Congressman, or even a Mayor. If the YouTube rules were applied to these folks, we literally wouldn&#39;t live in a democracy, hence why criticism should not be stymied in this way.

He&#39;s takimg a break from youtube...Because he&#39;s going to overthrow Susan and own it. Pewdiepie for CEO of youtube 2020 boys

People say weird things to get likes soPineapples

You deserve the break, man.

Felix, I agree. YouTube does nothing, it&#39;s the creators that are YouTube. This corporation needs to get their shit together and actually know what&#39;s going on on their platform and not let whiners like Logan Paul get all the money.

Jeez dude! is your wife pregnant or something?!But good luck man, you deserve a break!

Take care pewds
I’m really curious if we can copyright YouTube rewind

So basically you want YouTube to give you and other Youtubers more freedom to do what you want?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Has anyone had trouble since the YouTube update: up loading from apps such as iMovie to get 4K quality on your videos to a new channel created after the update? Is there any possible solution?

We all know who&#39;s that degenerate scumbag Pewds talking about 

Go to mixer or Nebula dude, let&#39;s use your network to reverse this executives decision, don&#39;t go to Twitch they are part of the same problem like YouTube...

Felix needs to pioneer the way for a new platform, the YouTube days are gone. It’s a corporate cess pool

I really miss 2009 youtube.

Someone has to create a new YouTube like in the past

Wottt?!

When you can call out your own platform for dumb shit they do because they need you in their website for the ads

Everything is jumbling and getting confusing o_O? Should I flag pewds and together see what would YouTube do? Naah... that would never work, &#39;&#39;why?&#39;&#39; You may ask... &#39;Cause Pewd is too hot to touch and even YouTube knows that &lt;3

what is fb made an app like YouTube and everyone went there bet Google and YouTube would pull their heads out of their àsses pretty fast

YouTube bad.

YouTube: our shares are going low , we need a plan to milk our PocketsEmployee 1: promote new content which is future reliable Employee 2: popularise content of talented underdogs Employee 3 : jst ammend some new act and cut of the revenue of all the creators YouTube: employee 3 u are promoted !

Hei in Russian
And all those asmr videos bro if it ain&#39;t explit sexual content I dunno what is 

YouTube is becoming dog 

Pewds i thought you were  cool but you are a alt right puppet 

YouTube should listen to its content creators rather than making up shit. :p

Childhood makes up but 1/3 rd of a humans life, granted some laws and regulations are good to protect children, but YouTube is for 13+, to pass rules and laws and bubble wrap the world and have the majority of adults cater to a few children is silly, it like banning floors cause children keep falling on them. Makes no sense whatsoever, and I would never build a company on such shaky business foundation and expect it to rise and be successful. Cause your success can never be credited to you any more then your failures. How is one to know if your good at it when it’s so easily manipulated. All one can do is compare it to previous performance rather then spending time building and making better.

Goose-stepping in a brown shirt and burning crosses takes time...

Most Trusted in News!

Youtube is now YouPoop

So ruthless hating on the other youtubers... I love it hahah set em straight

Eveyone who isnt gonna follow pewdiepie on 2020 join my channel

Pewdiepie talks about selective media stuffs...I’m just not gonna go there

Next year, we should all research pews again on Valentine&#39;s day lmao

That moment when pewds doesn&#39;t even says onsion name

When your channel gets fined for lying about the kid thing, but you play 15+ games on your channel: hold up

I like this newscaster <b>Poppy</b>  <b>Smoria</b> than most newscasters on TV.

so content cop gets deleted but onision still has his entire channel?

YouTube is being ignorant, that’s all I gotta say.

I can explain YouTube&#39;s policy:  Bunch of weak minded fascists with more power than they really should have.  If this was Sparta, they&#39;d been thrown off a cliff.

With its new guidelines YouTube has jumped with both feet from platform to publisher. Let the Taxation commence

YouTube is slowly destroying itself, thanks to catering to advertisers and no longer caring about the creators

i have a half baked idea that could explain why youtube does shit: theyre all boomers prolly

Pewds should make a new platform thats like YouTube

Pewds is starting to look a lot like Ashton Kutcher when he was younger.

Bored of pewdipies videos

Marzia Kjelllberg ESCAPES to Sweden as Pewdiepie quits YouTube

Keep preaching!

i love pewdiepie but I think he needs to give Liza and Lilly a break, theyre annoying but theyre not evil. and they do make some people laugh

Ah, the ol&#39; reduction of definitions to the point of subjective interpretation and inevitable enforcement trick.

the tubes and internet can be tru human corruption

Youtube, you gotta let creators be human don&#39;t usually do this but like for top to reach so it bumps guys (words spread by likes let&#39;s get this bread)

this man have nothing genius... i tried to understand this idiot, but i can&#39;t

you look tired man

YouTube: You&#39;re a public figure, you&#39;re responsible for what your viewers do. So if your viewers do dumb shit, we aren&#39;t making you advertiser friendly.Also YouTube: You&#39;re not a public figure, you can&#39;t say anything bad about other YouTubers, who are also not public figures.YouTube Aswell: Would have let Daddy of Five keep abusing their children for views and money.

It was nice of you to not mention Jack by name

Best of luck to you pewds in your break. Hope you get as much out of life as you can, look forward to your return but hope you take as much time as you need.

Poppy smoria...big peepee
Our community is scared to share opinions?Must be harassment.  Couldn&#39;t <b>possibly</b> be YouTube&#39;s policies, could it?

YouTube needs to do a better job preventing harassment on YouTube?Yes, harassment by YouTube against creators.

I cant believe Pewdiepie is QUITTING youtube...

If pewds takes a break he won’t come back to this drama lol

Its good for pewds to take a break because he need it after 10 years

Speechless over how true the order system of the youtube community.

Getting ads in the middle of this video just adds to it

I&#39;d cancel my netflix subscription if it meant you had your own subscription based streaming site just so you could get away from this crap. I think I speak for most 19 year olds when I say we&#39;d all pay whatever subscription if it meant you were happier

What if all YouTubers went to another website to teach YouTube a lesson

Pewdiepie we need a new type of YOUTUBE it&#39;s about time Pewdiepie so chief if theres a new site I recommend ya leave if you get screwed

jesus christ, why the hell are the news media so against pewds.

I think what it comes down to is personal bias. Not just in the media, but pretty much every big company or corporation is driven by some sort of agenda. Ultimately, no matter what party you identify with or what your beliefs are, you cannot deny that honest and straightforward media is unfortunately a thing of the past.

Hihi
Him saying break being old is like playing cod with the boys and saying see y’all tomorrow and never getting back on..........

Pewds:makes fun of people for announcing a brake before they go on itAlso Pewds:I&#39;m going on brakePewds:am I a joke to you?

Should try FloatPlane. Would be interesting to see someone as influential as Pewdiepie on that platform. Could cause a BIG change.

Hearing pewds call Greg a scumbag is so satisfying

They obviously don&#39;t care about us all &#39;cause I&#39;ve been subjected to severe racism on YouTube and nothing was done about it. Not even when my account was hacked, I had to pay for my own lawyer.

Meanwhile Logan Paul killing and torturing animals repetitively and filmed a dead body of somebody who killed themselves near winter holidays and the poor family of the dead man has to see and hear that from youtube and he gets to get away with several misdemeanors in USA, Japan, and other countries and torturing of animals is a felony.

Pewdipie Floatplane??? Good idea yes!

Make your own platform!

I agree Pewds, Onision is a scumbag

This video is Felix saying that YoutTube is the oldest anarchy server.

Heartbroken 
How dare he take a break. My job is so much harder than him and he makes more money than me! I am deeply dissapoint in him.

Good for u. Go take a break and make babies with Marzia

You and your mates should start your own video hosting website. For real pewdiepie. YouTube needs competition and the market is ripe for this. So many people dislike YouTube but love you so I don’t know, do something with that

Dude... when are you gonna have your own website in which you host your own videos and get 100% of the revenue? Use youtube as a marketing platform rather than allow them to use you. You got the money to buy your own server and hire proper web developers.

Minecraft goodYouTube bad

@<a href="">3:47</a> Onision

How public figures are picked (maybe idk):If you attract users outside the platform, you&#39;re a public figureIf you attract already existing users, you suck

YouTube is really on some crack, but I will still watch it and watch all of the add knowing that there are people who have this as their job, and go to bed stressing about their job every night, and every penny helps for them, and so I feel good watching ads.

You should go to StoryFire

Felix: I’m taking a break from YouTube early 2020 bc I’m tiredNews sites: <b>pewdiepie quits YouTube, goes bankrupt, turns into Donald trump and leaves fans heartbroken</b>

I like how he hesitated  to say pissed but then says bullshit 2 seconds later . Very big brain

Onionson is gonna thrive from this update

PEWDS YOU SHOULD MAKE A ALTERNATE YOUTUBE.

The biggest problem I have with this logic is when eh says that they have &#39;a system&#39;. Obviously the system isn&#39;t working if many creators are complaining &#39;time and time again&#39;. He also said that it would prevent social discouraging of bad events like with the gambling or dead body controversy. This is an entirely different case as they both did something extremely wrong, both morally and potentially legally. Criticism of them would not be things like implied threats, making fun of race or orientation, or anything else prohibited, so social discouraging would still take place.

Someone please tell me the flannel shirt he&#39;s wearing

Pewds is like eren playing solo on yt and hating everyone except the small few that helped him in the beginning

Conspiracy theory : what if just what if Google itself is the one that called ftc, what if Google is using the law to make the change.YouTube doesn&#39;t want creators they want networks and network actors and actresses because they know that if the creators leave that sudden viewers too and they will become the next MySpace, they want to replace our cable. Because people are on the Internet a lot all networks in one place they would earn more than what thier getting now that&#39;s why thier willing to lose money..

YouTube: Express yourself! Also YouTube: No, not really.

Why did I just get a notification 3 days later

<a href="">5:39</a>

Honestly, assholes are just gonna abuse the new no bullying policy. And I’m not happy they took down the leafy content cop

<a href="">3:41</a> Holy shit, he&#39;s calling out Onision! Not saying his name is the right call given Greg&#39;s MO, but there&#39;s no doubt it&#39;s about him. Way to go Felix!

Who is he talking about at <a href="">3:54</a>?

The reason that you are allowed to ridicule politicians is that politicians are really powerful and have traditionally suppressed criticism through force. It&#39;s not at all the same thing as harassing people making YouTube videos or others in creative outlets

5th day of pewdiepie using the same thumbnail

Way better than keemstars bullshit

This is what happens when we start regulating speech

8 months after he is back huys meet my bebe

PewDiePie I agree with you wholeheartedly! But you&#39;ve got to understand YouTube wants to be a TV network. They don&#39;t want to be big on community like they have been in the past, it doesn&#39;t make the money that they want! Me myself have never really been into YouTube who deal in shock value, I find it annoying. The side of YouTube I love is a sign of passing information and ideas. I&#39;ve learned to do so much with these two hands repairing things building things. I&#39;ve got two new people from cultures that I used to not be able to stand, like Russians once I saw how they had to fight against their leaders and the Nazis during World War II! It made me think of the Revolution here that bought us the Constitution of the United States of America. I used to think Mormons were all moron until I met a character call Shay Carl. ShayCarl is just like me capable of Good and Evil just like me! YouTube

Pewds why did you stop doing Minecraft videos ?

S S U S U C S U C K S U CS U S

How does Pewds makes his own Mobile Games like this? Plus, did he just release a new game about anuses defecating and using flatulence? And did he make his wife a &quot;farting ass?&quot; Is this another dirty fetish? I&#39;m so confused. 

ya know pew&#39;swhile your video games is a great means to extend a financial revenue stream for yourself, and i totally understand business 101, you should re-invest some of your wealth into developing a rival media streaming platform. Or teaming with a smaller outfit like mixer, much like Tyler (Ninja) did. YouTube has gone too far with their recent changes. i refuse to upload anymore videos to youtube anymore because of their rules that are over reaching above the FCC laws in place. CaptainSparkles has the best way in mind to remedy this but YouTube is placing all the weight on the creators shoulders. Good luck buddy in your off time. we all need it from time to time.

I bet pew news is more popular than a national news channel

i really can&#39;t wait for YouTube&#39;s reaction

Wtf is this video game ad at the end... such bullshit

YouTube: stale and generic

Go further with YouTube
we are f*#*ed

Pewds went fricking savage on this one

PewdiePie explaining Market Response!  The Freemarket is mostly self-regulating. The word gets around, communities police themselves.

Why YouTube  whyyyyyyyyyy
Pewds need a break, i Will stay here, waiting for you :3

I watched an animated video and my recommendations started becoming baby cartoons... so about that

God bless those who sub me

Pewds is leaving YouTube because Marzia pregernant

Trending in gaming
PewDiePie, Mr. Beast &amp; Logan Paul ??? They are the best in world!!! But my videos suck...Hahahha. Frankly speaking, I am in need of help.

I have the feeling that he&#39;s going to return from his YouTube break with some amazing book reviews

<a href="">10:47</a>

1984 called

I don’t blame Felix for wanting to leave

Pewds: im taking a break im very tired...News: PEWDIEPIE BURNOUT!!! pewdie pie is retiring from YouTube due to burnout....

Felix for the love of all that is good please change ur thumbnails

T-Series yes
Good, get you some rest in the new year  see you when you’re feeling good!

Came here because of that &quot;Pew quiting YT&quot; news.. But hey, lol it&#39;s way more different than I expected. EXXX!But if time comes when Pew will start focusing his new life chapter. My big support and respect..

Happy this dude is redpilling all the kiddos

he said &quot;bader&quot; <b>copyright strike</b>

Pewdipie: I&#39;m tired News: HE&#39;S QUITING YOUTUBE!!

From Russian like to comment
Imagine Youtube finding Filthyfrank old content

Are there any Russians here?
Who is searching for Nicki Minaj?

Im to blame for bella

Don’t leave, it’s exactly what they want you to do!!!

Baby pewds coming 2020?

Who else thinks he should keep uploading

i dont blame you for wanting to take a break, Felix...you should just ride off into the sunset with your lovely wife and live life...luv ya dude! you da best!

Baby pewds will take over the world!!

Take yo break homie 
Get that vacation time in pewds well deserved

Dude everyone is a public figure wtf

I think I got a good idea to help weaken youtube. Pewdiepie posts a video on youtube every day, correct? What if, once a week, he posts a video on ANOTHER website that is not youtube? Then his followers will go to that website and help it grow. Now, what if pewdiepie uses his influence to convince other popular youtubers to do the same? When youtube sees other websites gaining popularity, then they will be forced to listen to their creators.

google is more and more turning into the gestapo of our current times.

Don&#39;t change the layout again please

Have a nice break Felix

They even didnt make my country (indonesia) to use donate system at all like they are going add it but till now never added it

Most searched people... I pretty sure that was for F*P... are all women except for pew...

<a href="">10:44</a> (Special Announcement)

Excellent video
Are you serious about taking a break? Japanese
&quot;Im smoutsies&quot;-- that&#39;s good, I like that..

PewNews = PewRant

Dang Pewds, knocking it our of the park again.

Guys, look at his left hand. I think pew news is fake!

Hi! American law student here: so the reason that public figures or officials in America get a pass for ridicule is because of our defamation law: the view is since these people purposely thrust themselves into the public limelight, they opened themselves up for criticism and parody. The difference between them and youtubers is that youtubers can be normal people who just put videos up; they haven’t necessarily purposely exposed themselves to the entire public the way that public figures and officials have. Public figures here can still sue for defamation but there has to be a reckless disregard for the truth that the person saying it recklessly or knowingly did, even though they knew there was a high likelihood what they were saying was BS. Hope this helps!

have a good rest please come back stronger Pewdiepie

Iron Fork
Take as long as you need pewds. Well deserved break. We will be here waiting for you when you get back. 

<a href="">4:24</a> this is so sad and true. Since the recent passing. Of Juice wrld im being recommended his videos by youtube which is kinda messed up

you never talked about the steven crowder thing!

I made a video about this a couple years ago predicting and explaining this. This has to do with censorship laws. It’s all about how the work of art is viewed as a whole. This is something that is taught in school.

Still waiting for iDubbbz to make Content Cop on Onision.

9yo:Pewds Your Deserved To Take A Rest9yo: Crying in the room

We should just call everyone we dont like Poopyscoops so that youtube cant catch it

YouTube is now basically policing Pre-crime at this point. It&#39;s like a Minority Report dystopia.Whereas previously WHEN people made mistakes the community would call people out on it, much like a real legal system whereby you had to have done something wrong PRIOR for people to try someone in public court. Rather that now where they&#39;re trialling people BEFORE they&#39;ve even done something. It&#39;s total madness. And to top it all off they&#39;re now trialling people for doing something historically, where in a real legal sense there&#39;s a statue of limitations, because evidence degrades and loses context when not observed in the present.

Can <b>**</b> get *00000 with out a videoWhy does this guys existing so much in the comments

Is pewds really gonna quit yputube

Felix: I’m taking a breakArticle: anti-Semitic-accused far-right youtuber says the pressure is getting to him and may never return to creating videos, sources report

Pews if father     Question mark

This is the worst time to be a youtuber...

Content doesn&#39;t disappear from the internet. If Youtube filters criticism, they&#39;ll just move to another platform, and create traffic there. Youtube creates its own enemies.

It’s really just to give him time to create pewtube.

Let’s strike YouTube

Great video

Boy when he takes this break, and then returns, it&#39;s gonna be the hypest shit you&#39;ll ever see. All the 9 year olds gone be squee

@<a href="">5:22</a> The Gokanaru H3h3 video vigilante is bomb y&#39;all should check it out if you haven&#39;t yet

Leafy is the messiah

This is all about censorship for the 2020 US elections. Project veritas has done some amazing work exposing google&#39;s true agenda

To think that Youtube is run by morons that lacked common sense...

We should take our content, and PUSH it somewhere ELSE.

Using sarcasm is gonna make youtube think everyone is actually impressed with the changes that are happening

May Filthy Frank, H3H3, Idubbbz, Anythingforviews, and Maxmoefoe Rest in Peace. I miss Papa Franku but youtube made it impossible for him to survive on this format.

YOUtube, do us all a favor and change your company&#39;s name.

Who is Russian
this was made so peps will not harras youtube rewinde

smol pp

All next year?

Sub

Felix, you are so hilarious You actually made this funny 

I&#39;m taking a break from youtube...... SO I CAN PLAY MINECRAFT

Interesting how YouTube is run in the USA and yet they are treading on our freedom of speech...

Me: watches videoOthers: SWOREMe: i do not condone this but he does have the swore pass for this reason

In America &quot;public figures&quot; is not a media rule but a legal concept that judges follow when they determine who can and cannot sue for libel and or slander under different standards. Its so fucking broad as to be considered ridiculous. 99.999% of people in media ANY media including the lunatic on your local cable public access with 2 viewers is considered a &quot;public figure&quot;. So for youtube to say a creator is not a public figure but the president or other politician is one is just wrong.

Who gives a shit about harassment we need mixed option for our vids

If language is a criteria then they got the wrong content cop

Poopdie ad, very epic.
PEWDIEPIE QUITS YOUTUBE!!! IS HE THE NEXT UNABOMBER?

Save us Felix create a new platform that doesn’t suck be our lord and savior

Poopdie
Okay, but why does mainstream media get a pass to ridicule public figures but channels that aren&#39;t government funded like Stephen Crowder gets censored so thoroughly?

The man is spitting facts right here. I&#39;ve been watching YouTube for years and this is really seeming like the end for this platform. When one of your biggest creators is telling you that he cannot cope with how awful the system has become and is thinking of temporarily coming off of the platform surely that should make you change your format.

When you realise It&#39;s Poppy Smoria going on a break so technically Pewds will still be around

Take all the time you want... You deserved it  We&#39;ll be 29 years old  tho.... We grow up fast

That descriptions first 2 words tho

WHY ARE TOU BULLYING YOUTUBE YOU JERK?!?!!?!!!?!!! REPORTED!?

YouTube is just slowly trying to completely do away with monetization. How can they say that anything with curse words, “harassment”, and anything that might make people triggered. And then that say anything geared to kids (which could be argued anything), has no monetization

YouTube is bad I never get people watching my videos

roundest forehead ever
&#39;Two legs bad, four legs good&#39;
Isn’t this why YouTube Kids exists?

Social engeinering is so tempting for those in Power

Pewds lookin like he had a mental breakdown since he overcame his minecraft addiction.

Pewds should just make his own website that he uploads too. YouTube doesnt care about what the people want or the content creators anymore

Hey it&#39;s my favorite news channel

I’m not used to him swearing so much it’s so weird

he literally said for a little while. for the people who are writing those stupid articles just heard the first few sentences and started writing their article. which is just forcing their own narrative on to people

Youtube added this system to stop youtubers from creating videos about youtube rewind :p

Now I get why Youtube doesn&#39;t like you Felix... You&#39;re spitting facts

Well deserved break bro! All the best! Rest well good sir

Youtube is breaking under its own woke weightBut still none of you are leaving...

I barely get on youtive  anymore I am on twitch

<a href="">3:40</a> Fousy tube?

Am I alone here 🇷🇺?! LOOOOOOL
Pewd, Why Did I Get 4 Raid: Shadow Legends Ads

YouTube kids exists for a reason. Don&#39;t ban apples because some people have braces

we have to admit of yt wasn&#39;t this fucked up he wouldn&#39;t have done that

Pewdiepie DESERVES a break from youtubeI&#39;ve been watching him for 6 years and he barely had a break.Tbh i kinda hope he stays away for a while Not just a little whileI don&#39;t blame him thoYoutube is getting worse every year

FFS PLEASE FIND ANOTHER SOUND TO CENSOR WITH !!!!!!

Proud of you for planning to take a break! Of course we will miss you but we’re very happy that you’re putting your life first 

Hello

I think the other scumbag creator he was talking about was onision 

I dont understand, do you support steven crowder ?

I love you pewds take as much time as you want

YT is DEAD  !!! It killed itself, unlike epstein, who is on Clinton&#39;s list....

I miss 2013. Youtube was so much entertaining back then. Although my 13 year old self was watching questionable content it was funny af

Felix is gonna end up on Rogans podcast next year mark my words!

Who the hell doesn’t understand like a comment and I really don’t know why he has 100 million daddies, he’s boring
Political speech is protected under the First Amendment of the the United States Constitution.

Don&#39;t you mean you&#39;re &quot;quitting YouTube&quot; as you&#39;ve made &quot;over 25 million&quot; and you&#39;re &quot;too tired&quot; daily fricking fail strikes again, surprised the headline didn&#39;t involve white supremacist millionaire quits YouTube... enjoy your brake mate, think you&#39;ve earned it 

got a little wet spot in my pants when he said, &quot;That other VOX guy&quot; HAHAHAHAHA

If Pewdiepie quits YouTube a hundred million people will cry in pain!!!

Youtubers ruined YouTube

It’s time to make another version of YouTube

Carlos Maza.... the most hated man on YouTube. This is what happens when snowflakes get power.

Guess they haven’t read the US Constitution... it’s called Ex Post Facto, enforcing laws retroactively.

<a href="">3:50</a> onision, had to say it

Who Has big PP???

Felix just make a new YouTube, we’ll follow

YouTube:crate YouTube kids YouTube:that doesn&#39;t exist

So PewDiePie is gonna take a break, but what about Poppy Smoria?

bullying is underrated

Poo News.

youtube=you tubeyoutube poop=you tube poop

YouTube Bad.

Tumblr says that pewdiepie was leaving youtube

I don't understand it, but it's very interesting
YouTube is afraid of Felix, they cannot remove his channel.

PEWDIEPIE DOESN&#39;T NEED YOUTUBE.YOUTUBE NEEDS PEWDIEPIE.
Now that his thumbnails are all look the same I miss out on videos because I think I already watched them

somewhat unrelated but leafy kinda looks like L from death note

I don&#39;t understand why yt even needs to censor everything they have that yt kids that&#39;s so great right? But they know it sucks

I love how you didn’t title the video “im quiting youtube”

pewds: go vote on creator of the year!tana: already won ugh

<b>PewDiePie for YouTube Presisdent</b>

YouTube sucks sometimes

does PewDiePie have the fortune to start his own videohosting service or perhaps contribute to another one that exists like Dailymotion or maybe Vlare?

wait, Poppy Smoria is taking a break from youtube ???

Im tired boss

..... pew news!

This is straight up censorship, and unlawful speech discrimination. They know they have created a Social Media Bubble where the leftist propaganda resonates within.Now they can deploy the &quot;army&quot; of social justice worriors to go and strike channels that dare to not think like them. Say goodbye to Paul Joseph Watson, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson.. you name them..

FELIX USE BITCHUTE IT HAS NO COPYRIGHT AND IT NEEDS HELP ALSO U CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT

If you

thank god u look dead af
felix deserves this break. he gets so much hate when hes probably the most respectful, nicest and understanding youtuber ever. i saw some ppl trying to say hes as bad as logan paul, and i just,,,, geez. have a nice break next year felix ! 

Pew has decided.. He knows he has to take a side. I think he&#39;s with us.

<a href="">3:15</a> -- Don&#39;t beg. Use this opportunity to create YouPew.

Gonna miss u legend
Pewds we love u just do what u wanna do

YO pewdiepie should think about switching over to floatplane.

I saw an article saying that he&#39;s quitting YouTube next year and I was, no joke, in fucking tears. Get that rest boy. Get the stress off your back. The 19 year Olds will always waitI just realised pewdiepie is Peter pan and alll 100mil+ of us are lost boysWile will always wait! And we&#39;ll never get a day older ️

But will poppy smoria continue?

Plz just outvote Emma Chamberlain, Lilly Singh, Tana Mongeau, and COLLINS KEY.

You deserve a break pewds ️
Petition for pewdiepie for creating new youtube like platform..............

Kinda wish pewds would make his own platform, as he has alot of information of how to actually be a YouTuber and help and showcase positive, funny and real creators

Another Minecraft?

if pewds uploaded to dailymotion i&#39;d still watch him there

SoyTube, lest we hurt some scumbag’s feelings

people who disliked this video are working for susan

You should take a break you deserve it; and if anyone has problem they have smol pp

youtube works wonders magical terrible usa forced or something like that but he understands that the site can break out and there will be a new site i want the new rules bother me because most bloggers or youtuber can’t do streams because a lot of them have been gone for a long time and everyone 5 they turn off monetization not on YouTube, but on YouTube s pointing site, well, I m not getting any more intelligent names; I want to wish you some fun and lots of money and a good life and rest from YouTube, as you said

Thank you!! Liza is so over rated. Her content is boring and annoying

how about terraria series?

Some one writed an article that...&quot;pewdiepie lefts youtube&quot;... like television in my country.. Romania.. ProTV... like lol.. wtf..  pewds dosent... do dat.. dat stinky... small brain.... I cry do dat..    edit&#39; oooo now I understand... I HOPE YOU DOOINH GOOD.. really pewds,you really earned that

I like how YouTube wants to make a more friendly and safe place, but they put anti gay ads on lgbtq channels. Even though they made themselves and other people feel better about who they are.

I love YTP

You know if Felix made his own site like Youtube, people would flock to that shit.

You don’t need to explain anything man. Enjoy your break

Pewds literally is correct about most of what he said.

BITCHUTE is the new wild west for video creators YOUtube would shit if we all went there!!

Damn PewNews spreading some real truths. Great examples of communities coming together keep bad content out. We don&#39;t need small brain YouTube police

Pewds said he is taking a break from youtube but he didn&#39;t say he is not going to make videos ;) maybe he already found some better platform.

Pewtube new platform

Youtube freaking believes in sunshine, rainbows and unicorns, wake up people society doesnt work that way. This will do nothing but strengthen this snowflake generation.

Goodbye pewdiepie 2020 youtubemy favourite youtuber .

Its obvious. With these rules from YouTube. Even i would take a brake

would be cool if he migrates somewhere else, that&#39;ll basically make the new place somewhere good for the rest of us.

Youtube bad

Pewtube

I get it that you are taking a break. You are tired and need time with your family. I get it, I need a break from my own job too.

Looking forward to the day Youtube getting replaced

Good for you Felix you deserve a break. Youtube has been going down hill badly as of late to unfortunately.

Actor takes a break from moviesMedia:... PewDiePie takes break from YouTubeMedia: racist, sexist millenial scum bag quits YouTube forever

Move to floatplane

YouTubes a website and an app, not a ducking world, we don’t need cops YouTube, people can distinguish good from wrong and if they can’t then that’s why others step in, chill bro, it’s not that serious

Brawndo cryptocurrency is &quot;de wae&quot;Invest now to keep you &#39;baitin&#39; far into the glorious future.

If YouTube is dying so why not we ourself Create our own YouTube?

You are the #1 creator, why dont you create Pewdietube

Disavow

Time to move over to pornhub

No

YouTube is run by a bunch of snowflakes and Gay millenials

Pewds needs to change the censored sound, it&#39;s way too loud

Thing: Hur hur hurAlso thing: Hur hur hurAm I doing it guys?Edit: Seriously though, Felix. It&#39;s good that you&#39;re taking a break.

YouTube has become a deranged parent. Tells you to ask before leaving the table, then says you can&#39;t leave the table after you&#39;ve asked 

How about UsTube? We&#39;ll make it more about us and less about You... or them? I&#39;ve confused myself

YouTube is slowly trekking into Demolition Man territory here people.

Sucks that YouTube Rewind

Dont you think YouTube is being cornered by its own creators...

Niceeee

Imagine FilthyFrank was still making videos.....

Well Felix see you in 2021 or 2020

Infowars was banned forever SAD
