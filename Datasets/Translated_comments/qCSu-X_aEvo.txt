That &quot;boobs window&quot;..😅😅😅

Poor girl! She wears a very old holey suit

❤❤❤❤Priyanka
The thing about Indian women is that they start to get fat and out of shape in their 30s.   It&#39;s all over once they hit 40.

I always find good site of you .And, It exist inside you ,not in your costume manner . but as far as I saw you the day you really were holly dressed.

i hate he said you might break out into a song.. and PC gave him the right answer . QUEEN

The Bollywood movie “PK” starring Aamir Khan, is a really good movie involving an alien, highly recommend it

Wtf is she wearing???

Jaadu’s offended now🙂

Girl you forgot Krish 3???
my only complain with her is that how could she forget The alien of india ?? jadoo supremacy

In Bollywood only nepotism... true talent niglected... Priyanka you such all round performance in acting, singing,divas....

Her English accent ....wow

Bollywood movies are horrible

Her accent is the best. It&#39;s not that you need captions nor is it completely indian (indian english has some words that&#39;s just pronounced wrong) . Ironically Indians agree on each indian having a different accent and yet criticizes someone for having a style that differs from them. Also, learning different accents is no less than learning languages, it&#39;s not about faking it it&#39;s about making it

We have jadoo!

<a href="">0:35</a> you don&#39;t say...

in forgotten misery!!!!!
Rocnxkd skcndj
Hii

I love her voice the way she talk is amazing 😘😘😍😍😘

I love her understanding skills
She is just amazing....

She literally workers in a sequel of an alien film 😂😂

Show on

Oh come on woman 95% of Bollywood movie are 1 mixture of action, drama, romance, songs and hero licking.Plus, if your industry figures out how to make sci-fi, then you can have aliens in India.

Mary Kom movie was one of my favorite shows in which  she starred in.

<a href="">

It ignores me how he consistently cuts her off not a shocker though …

Seth, if alien lands in India. It won’t even make it to the newspaper or the end of the day. Forget about making a chaos lmao.

What hell her dress, smartness is good  but ........, english is destroying the culture of south asia.

I love how she screamed, I WANT AN ALIEN IN INDIA!! hahah! lol

Plot twist: You are stuck in a Priyanka Chopra interviews loop.

He&#39; not letting her speak and finish her sentences.

Wonderful PC! Really feel proud when watch you getting more success...just LOVE u 😍😍

American director after this:Let&#39;s land aliens in India 🇮🇳 in poverty area surrounding poor people for 5-10 mins scene and win Oscars

American director after this:Let&#39;s land aliens in India 🇮🇳 in poverty area surrounding poor people for 5-10 mins scene and win Oscars

I love her accent

Jadu!!!

She is not faking her accentShe is choosing one&amp; I love her American accent

Subtitles Annoying A Lot 😅

<a href="">5:30</a> Priyanka - aliens only ever land in America. I WANT AN ALIEN IN INDIA.meanwhile jadoo - 👁️👄👁️ 🥲
Bollywood, Kpop same struggles...

She is amazing

Hey anyone noticed Priyanka&#39;s safety pin earrings.

Why is nobody talking about the elephant in the room?

<a href="">5:37</a> Jaadu and PK are crying. Also, Pixel&#39;s aliens destroyed the Taj Mahal. Do we really need more aliens when we can&#39;t ourselves escape from being viewed as aliens? Yes, I said it.

ET was actually Satyajit Ray&#39;s story &amp; film (India). WB/Hollywood stole it &amp; had Spielberg direct. So - originally, the ET alien was in India.

Priyanka chopra exists<b>Indians</b> - who had summoned me

PC: I want an alien in India.ME : Is Jadu a joke to you !!

Now India is also plotting to spread destructive material against Islam. Now this new propaganda has started. My father used to sing in Masjid - Prianka Chopda. Watch what she says
I love Priyanka Chopra &#39;s MOM..... for giving her path to reach to top.....

Bollywood movies are not great films. They have singing and dancing in every film they make. Their films don&#39;t make any sense.

last time we got an alien in India Rakesh Roshan ruined it.......priyanka should know......she was in the sequel

For those people who think Bollywood is all dance numbers, see Gangs of Wasseypur part 1 and 2

Hritik Roshan hates her now She forgot Jadoo !!!!

Confident and smart woman.

V Indians discovered the 👽  but unfortunately they landed in America... Hrithik tried hard to get them back..but jadoo took them away..so next time whenever u get a chance or u see them in and around the USA please tell them to come home 😆😆 only u can bring them back..lol😜lv PC

Americans, you can be so much more......please evolve  ✌️

Can get enough of her... Her sense of humour is terrific! 🤗

...and she worked in Krishh franchise which is basically Koi Mil Gaya&#39;s sequel lol

Accent?? That&#39;s an issue?? Maaan she studied there, working there, married there and everyone around her speaks with that accent and you guys want her to not pick that accent?? How do you guys think that&#39;s possible?? If i watch friends whole day for two days, even i pick that accent 😂😂😂She has to pick the accent so the people there can understand her better. What&#39;s wrong in that. If someone from America goes to somewhere like south africa they will have to try and talk like them so that they can understand <a href="">better.so</a> accent is just a way to communicate properly. What&#39;s the point in talking in your accent if people won&#39;t get you. I think it&#39;s time we understand people and their situation and not judge them.

Why her coat is so tight?

....and!....simple!...&quot;our palm-lines aren&#39;t the same&quot;!.....😁😃

&quot;I want an alien in india&quot; 😂😂

PK an Indian movie about an Alien that lands in India,  he questions morality,  religion,  humanity,  diversity and so many other philosophical topics that no Hollywood movie about aliens had touched,  it is an expetional movie by the only amazing aamir Khan

Well &quot;koi mil gaya &quot; Had jadu landed in IndiaSo all aliens are not landed in america😂

No one :Literally no one : Jadu be like : Mujhe kha bhool gye 😂😂

I hated the show &#39;Quantico&#39;.

What about Jaadu ? 😂😂😂

Hollywood stereotype India is Hollywood are too good at making movies.

...and!....umm?!....&quot;Miss-World&quot; is maturing!.....but, can&#39;t get over her &quot;childish-Laughter&quot;!.....heck-heck-heck-heck!!!!...N. O.!.. .. 😂😁😃😊

&quot;I want ET&quot; Miss Gurl did you forget being part of the Krrish series

priyanka is the most beautiful girl i have ever seen . those lips that smile that incredible skin and the eyes along with the badness that she possess . she has my attention since the day she came to america. nick is the luckiest

Her accent doesn&#39;t sound fake at all....

Priyanka doesn&#39;t have a fake accent. She speaks coherent englisjlh.

You also have that talent and if you want to be there you can make it. It&#39;s not a big talent just acting we are actors in our life.  Think about the way you present yourself to different people in an unique way that&#39;s an acting skill you too have.  Yes she is acting just like anyone and the sector has made so big by our support and money since we have misconception that Hollywood, bollywood are only the best way of entertainment.  The life is beyond this.  There are many other good ways we entertain ourself.  Even if we choose to entertain ourself by choosing to watch movie then it&#39;s fine to watch that movie and appreciate the story and all the people who were involved in making that movie.  No need to waste our precious time following these people in their personal life thinking that they are real heroes.  Real heroes are standing at the border to protect us, covid warrior who are working by taking risk in their life.  Lets invest our time to read about them.  I am worried about those people blindly wasting their life after these people what dress they wear, how do they talk, what trip they went for and we see them doing vulgar things in their life like being naked, kissing their spouse on thr camera to release to public, smoking and drinking etc.  Do you real think watching these things really add value to our life?  In fact they are leading new generation to destructions by indirectly misguiding them to smoke, drink and expose their body in the public.  What is the difference between the women who are forced into prostitution without their consent to be naked in the closed room and Priyanka is showing her cleavage to provoke opposite sex on the public platform?  In that case I will appreciate a prostitute she is doing out of her bad situation of life and not like Priyanka.  This is just an example.  We must help our future generations to be better than us.  Lets do it not by praising unreal heroes rather praising a real heroes in the world.  Let our new generation will understand, they need to  have healthy lifestyle and not to be naked to mint money or get into smoking and drinking  habits or not even into affairs.  Rather let them have a purity of mind in terms of having a good relationship with one person and with their near and dear ones.  Her success or her words nothng to do with our life. Think in deep to understand.

She&#39;s a millionaire and she still went to Trader Joe&#39;s 🤣🤣🤣

Aliens in india?Well there&#39;s a movie called koi mil gaya (JADU)Nd Priyanka starred in its sequelWhat was that then

ZOMBIES ONLY LAND IN AMERICA LMFAO🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There are lot of negative comments here.. I don&#39;t understand why???? She clearly stated earlier that &quot;she fakes it until she learn it&quot;.. this is how even a small kid learn everything. No one can learn or start speaking like sheakspear. Maybe she is faking accent to expert it in later point of time. If we send a message, try to appreciate. Spread positivity. If negative thoughts plz kindly keep it to urself.

The host is so humble 💓 and pc always rocking 🙂 love her😍

The stereotype for Hollywood movies is that they all keep having sex out in the open. Yeah, the ultra sanskari think kissing is also sex.

Her pronunciation of words gosh👀

Aliens: *come to earthAmericans: save the worldIndians: Send them happily backKoreans: marry them

Priyanka’s dress is horrendous!! She doesn’t have any fashion sense...

Am I only one who gonna talk the host is a little bit rude Nah just my humble opinion

I wonder what she was thinking while asking her designer to design that dress.Priyanka to designer: Cut that part so that my breast is partly visible to everyone.Priyanka to everyone: Hello hello hello!!! My eyes are over here.Feminism in a nutshell.

Well said Priyanka

I used to live in the states for almost five years during my childhood. And I have almost the exact same accent as her. Trust me it&#39;s very natural, and it&#39;s annoying when people accuse you of forcing an accent.

No comments on her coat dress!!!

Not only Priyanka Chopra is an overrated actor but also she seems to be the most fake celebrity of all time. Also why the fake accent ?

Her dress has eyes 👁️👄👁️
Aliens did land in India in the Tamil film Super Deluxe,

This bastard will turn his tongue in the hagwas mouth
Even after seeing the face of the lab, I was torn in learning from A to Z.
Now she became confident that if she had given the poison publicly, otherwise she would have opened the book in her sleep and then would have come and fought with her mind, we are the only ones who are right, this is a very dangerous disease.
Physicologist caught the disease from us
VFX and CGI😂😂

Fbi fbi parrot is cramming like this, what knowledge do you have about commercial?
U will panic n break into a song🙄 old school n stereo at its heights

I love Priyankas and BTS RM&#39;s English Accent ,both are not Western but they have best Accents🎀

I feel Seth kept interrupting her too much cause he still wanted to finish his questions list🤔

She indeed cleared the misconception about Bollywood cause most people think is only music n danceNevertheless she&#39;s so proud of her roots

Uhhh Koi Mil Gaya???? jAaDuU???????
Her dress is awesome but the cuts on the chest is dangerous and unnecessary

Priyanka : Aliens only land in America  <b>jaadu has left the chat</b>

<a href="">5:38</a> , she forgot bout jadu

Horrible outfit she is wearing.

You look gross in this revealing outfit,

He&#39;s rude

<a href="">2:01</a> I&#39;ve started to believe that I have her fighting skills. xD

Mallu girl. 😂😂😂😂😂
Other such movie stereotypes:--1. Aliens always land in USA.2. If a certain city in US gets taken over its game over for rest of the world. Like no other country single or united can take down the threat if US can&#39;t.3. If there is a planet wide resistance force against earth-level threat it&#39;s got to be led by a US citizen.4. A lone US soldier can take down battalions of other country&#39;s army and not lose a limb.5. The &quot;one last time&quot; thing that they do. Seriously, in every movie the hero agrees to get &quot;back in the business&quot; for one last time. e.g. Rocky series, Fast series, Rambo series etc etc.6. If American hero goes to any other country they have got to fcuk the leading &quot;indigenous chick&quot;. Seriously look at almost every bond movie.Add more such points in reply guys.

She is stunning!!!

Instead of praising her for the way she rocking in each and every shows .People are getting into her accent.

Aliens usually land in America but we had Jadoo...

This woman&#39;s confidence is what I want to have!

I loved when she said the most ugly stereotype of brown for America is that &quot;it&#39;s like,aliens land only in America&quot;..I cracked out

That jacket design with boob holes is really unflattering.... -_-

I just love PC...she is just wow.

Jaddoo ( I can’t spell) and she was even in Krrish

I LOVE YOU

She is Clever and So Impromptu Perfect at her Eloquency.<a href="">5:55</a>..Beauty with Brains

She&#39;s awesome

Looks like its freezing in the studio 😋😋😋

I Love Priyanka... And her Super Coolest Mom..... ❤️ 😘😘😘😘😘😘Much Love to you Priyanka ... From India.... We are super blessed to have you....❤️🔥🔥🔥

I will break out into a song and kick butt. How about that? 🤣😁

Fazool dress ☹️
She is very very beautiful and charming

exactly why cant i meet ET here in kolkata. why cant i be Eleven from india going to montauk.O_o

She is very intelligent 💖👍

Jaadu is the alien equivalent of a table lamp people. It don&#39;t count

Cool dressed
We had an ET, it was jaadu. We want battleship/ independence day type of aliens .

Aliens land in india and ask for dhooooopppp 🤣🤣🤣 they come to take sun bath😆 and ultimately start speaking hindi...(dhoooopppp)

Jadoo is literally Indian E.T

What is she even wearing🖕🖕

I didn&#39;t See Her nipples 🤣😹😂.
French , Germans, Russians, or people in other countries don&#39;t criticize each other for speaking in an American accent Then why we Indians criticize each other....why bcz some of u guys feel jealous that u can&#39;t speak like that n the other person can If she is speaking in an American accent that means she know another accent.....not like some of u  fools , hiding behind that screen n criticizing others Come on grow up kids...

She&#39;s just like shine 😇🏜she&#39;s just wonderful 😍😍😘

That dress

Thank God! That thing from her left Pocket didn&#39;t came out. It was so near . Legends will get it👍 😜

Whose here curious about her dress..

She is so hot😍😍😍😍 ......xcellent actor and huamn
She has found a new way to show ur boobs, this is her <a href="">talent.wow</a> Keep it up baby👏👏👏👏👏

Breastfeeding outfit.

Koi Mil Giya and Krrish which she featured in one of the two, had aliens

Two cute balls..

Bollywood is NOT even a Place😆😂

There is nothing wrong in speaking in American accent with Americans coz you wanna mix. Fake it till u make it. Anyways, her accent is CLASSY. And priyanka represents India in hollywood not deepika. So stop comparing. And typical Indian accent doesn&#39;t sound cool to nobody you have to make some changes. I&#39;m Indian by the way.

Came to see her dress 👗

Her hands not make up&#39;ed ..😌

This woman is a hypocrite.. she didn&#39;t stand up for her own colleague sushant singh rajput whike she&#39;s the one standing up for black life matters movement.. she had to go to Hollywood as everyone bullied her and banned her.. us audience loved her yet she didn&#39;t stand up for her own colleague.. now we are banning her.. she can do small side roles in Hollywood and enjoy Nick&#39;s fame in us.. we are boycotting priyanka

Indian viewers like here...

Stop telling about her accent..for some person it keep changing when they stay on place for few months..🤷

Fake accent

Poor lady. Someone give her a new dress.

&quot;Hey PC, this is Alex Scott, (former ?) top FBI agent....can we talk about Quantico...I need the Quantico energy so no more ok, no more. I mean it, I am Quantico energy ok, no more. I&#39;m done running around telling the world you def did but did not but just a little but not if we close our eyes but squint it open that you had a nose job and something something lips?....&quot; -Alex Scott, (Former ?) Top FBI agent

Worst dress
Priyanka clothes , accenting her b()()bs .    She is a goddess

Binod

She’s so beautiful and I think her honesty is so great.

She is raising our indian flag in Hollywood so I think the trollers must stop trolling her

Hate

she is so hot.

PC🇮🇳❤️
We tamils ​​rule by taming the bull. Race is Tamil.
Wtf she wearing though🤦🏽‍♀️
Before Priyanka, Seth or their conversation, I notice the blazer-dress on the artist and go-That dress was so unaesthetic. It is fit to expose and does to expose to fit. Why would she choose it?

Wow she has Four eyes..

Boob tease

Indian film not just bollywood.  Plz follow south indian films they are amazing than bollywood but plz dont follow telungu films thats horrible

I’m sorry but I can’t stop looking at those slits in her dress and she has nipple print. it must be cold 😭

She was literally in Krrish. A movie about a man whose Dad was given Alien powers OMG PRIYANKA!!!

Someone plzz tell me...What the hell is wrong with her dress...??I mean why that gap...?

Why does her dress have holes in that place?!

This dress is fucking his mind <a href="">1:45</a>

<a href="">4:30</a>Welcome

He said we&#39;ll break out in to a song when alien will land in our country ! And I just can&#39;t agree more ! PS: I am an Indian

The host doesn&#39;t listen and let Priyanka finish sentence

A Bollywood dolly, nice 👗 dress, let it all hang out, nothings sacred anymore, yikes!6

<a href="">4:22</a> godamnit!!!
Hollywood stereotypes1. Alien invasion2. War freak superheroes3. In a global setting, the Americans save the day.4. They have a wide variety of Zombies and Vampires.

She wants E.T.? She&#39;s already got jadooo....

Goddess.

You gave us Krrrishhhh, PCJ. And it was crap.

People need to stop critisizing her , she worked like really hard....And her accent?? Dude , she won&#39;t get any films , shows if she won&#39;t change her accent!! People in west won&#39;t understand her....so stop...

I literally became her fan when she said &quot;Though music is the most important part of OUR INDUSTRY (BOLLYWOOD)&quot; she is soo down to her origin 😊

Raj kumar hirani listened to her

Those are distracting me again and again😅😅🤣🤣

That dress though.

She made a mistake in the past for being in an ad for fairness but that was just once. She is now a very amazing actress with BROWN skin tone, takes pride and stands by her nationality and isn&#39;t a size zero. She is what people should call a ROLE MODEL

MISS KAIDE ANY

She wants E.TJaadu is disappointed

She wants aliens in india😂😂She really forgot that she was married to a guy with superpowers whose dad brought aliens to India 😂😂

She fought hard to say that Bollywood movies does not have characters that just breaks out into a song in every single movie because all of her movies in Bollywood has done just that. 😂 😂😂 They made her sing and dance.

New Delhi episode 3
The way she speaks is legit amazing....!!!!

Dont get fooled by her in this interview

You guys🙄criticizing her for her accent that she naturally has makes you people nasty. PERIOD😐😐

Why her jacket is cut whole in it hi hi😂😂😂

Very nice she thinks and talks

Priyanka u hard worked.. You made ur recognise face Arround the world

For all those bashing her up for her accent- so what if she doesn&#39;t have what is considered to be an &quot;indian accent&quot;? I don&#39;t understand why having any kind of accent would bring in hate, fake or not.

She is so annoying and a hipocrate

I don&#39;t like that suit!

this comment section smells super spicy masala type judgemental 😍  it&#39;s cute indians fighting over almost everything 😆

She is another strong woman as we have Kangana... bollywood gets people from outside and throws away our own indians and look at Hollywood they accept our Indians with so much respect. Hats off you guys ...Respect

Watch &quot;Dangal&quot; it&#39;s lit
What is the girl's accent?
My God, She looks Disgusting.

Wtf? What would&#39;nt she use her original accent

Seriously i loved her dressing style. Soo windy because of ventilation 🤣

When speaking a foreign language people try to speak fluently. But when people try to speak fluently is apparently looked down upon. If you were speaking Hindi, would you rather sound like you were from North India or from US? Which accent would prove better fluency?

Oh my God she is so gorgeous🔥😍

What a a ugly dress!!!!

Nobody actually understood what Priyanka Chopra said, what she actually meant was, the next time Hollywood produces a movie with aliens in it, instead of the aliens landing in USA, the aliens should land in some other part of India.

I was literally looking at her pockets... They look full

Chili your dress
What the heck is this with her coat.

Phele priyanka ko karan jaise chutiye bhaav bhi na dete q ki vo outsider hai..But aaj priyanka ke peeche gumte hai. Kareena n karan johar.Sale karan nepotism ki maa .u killed innocnt sushant

Those pockets are in a very dangerous area 👀

Jaadu left the chat

What the hell is she wearing ?

One of my favourite interviews of her.

Are those black panthers eyes i see

I like this guy

I can&#39;t take my eyes off to her 😍😍

Where is your pocket now even .,  to keep some money it&#39;s weird to see the cuts happened exactly to be for pockets 😵😂😂

It&#39;s been so long since the last Krrish movie that Priyanka forgot the entire franchise and she&#39;s the female lead!😂

Hottest women of India

Priyanka has gotten uglier over the years. Her rhinoplasty is so bad.

I love her!! She really is a role model to many women around the planet. I believe criticising her just because she is married to a younger man and posses a brown skin doesn&#39;t really satisfies the situation where her works are truly remarkable, she wouldn&#39;t have won a miss world pagent if she  had been having any major flaws!! She is trying so hard there to meet wishes of many!! So if people appropriate her efforts more ,, then I guess it would be more cool thing to do!! I love you Priyanka. Keep the good work up🙂

very brilliantly answered 👌👌👌only dress not good

Priyanka&#39;s top is too revealing here.

She is an inspiration.

Respect for you Mam as you are the Symbol of Power of Indian Women

Mrs Green Card Jonas

Just for showing and hiding some parts of tits, she wears too small size dress. Fucking belly is burning out 😅😅😅

Actually according to me hollywood steriotype is avengers trying to save whole universe but end up just in america

Trust me here are either Indians or American😅

People looking to her boobs than hearing her. Truely. 😆, i cant concentrate to their conversation because of her dress code. Who are agree tap like butto 😂

Syncing lips to someone else&#39;s voice that&#39;s Bollywood &#39;Talent&#39;

Are those pockets for real?

Wow multiple ways to peek through

I completely showed the shame to my sister-in-law.
Indian. 9835723232
When you are in dilemma whether to show you boobs or not then you choose this kind of apparel

I click  this video  jst bcuz of window on his boob..

tits

the clothes are like those of a prostitute
She gave really strong answers to tough questions.. hats off lady!!

I don&#39;t kine her nose !!

I havent seen one comment abt ppl talkin bad abt her accent and yet ive seen abt 50 comments telling ppl to stop talkin bad abt her accent😂😂😂

When you watch all her early 2000s movie, she&#39;s not so likeable

No matter how much you learn fake accents can always comes out...🤣🤣

Her pot belly is all over the place! 🐗

She is overrated so much annoying

He keeps interrupting her😩
Madam...jaadu...
Is she crazy or something!!!! She was the lead heroine in Krissh!!!!!

We used to see boobs now boobs are seeing us.. Amazing. Anyways trolling apart she is amazing and we indians are really proud of her. More power to her.

I like that they&#39;re having a fun conversation and really enjoying each other&#39;s company but they&#39;re cutting each other&#39;s conversation a lot to say their stuff, it&#39;s like that they have to catch a train.

Fake luvde ki hai <a href="">chinal.ki</a> raand kidr
Damn I wanna marry a woman older than me

Y is she wearing I&#39;ll fitted dress😕

I loved her in &quot;Barfi&quot;, she is completely an amazing actress. I was so thrilled when she came over here. I just admire her so much.

Most irrigating Celebrity.... Seriously
Gosh that suit is sucking her stomach out

Priyanka ur so true

&quot;aliens only land in America&quot; that was a great sentence to prove her point. Hilarious l😆

The whole comment section is about dissing and supporting her.I&#39;m like <b>eating</b> <b>popcorn</b> <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b>

my pecs are bigger than her bobs

OMG. She is gorgeous, but she shouldn’t show her assets

I want E.T and got PK

Now in This time!!corona is destroying every thing!!where is american super heroes who always saves world in every movie😥😁🤣

&quot;you can never tell at your mom&quot;<b>American kids have left the chat</b>

Silly dress. Shows her intention to get nude.

Very well said piggy, aliens land only in America. And only America can save world. N other countries will see how they&#39;re gonna do it on a big screen..🤣🤣

She really fakes her accent!  Priyanka-speak like you usually do and just relax!

Those are great puppies

Anti-Hindu Priyanka Chopra. 👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞👞
Start from 04.10. Thank me later.

Outfit perfect for new moms.

Most beautiful woman in the world Great actress hope see her again in Bollywood and Hollywood

Oh wait...... One alien did land in India! Remember Koi Mil Gaya? Girl you had acted in its sequel, gosh 🤦🏻‍♂️!
i thnk... priyanka dont put her skincare on her neck

She is definitely putting all her assets on display.

Her stomach is bulging!! So disgusting and her fake accent!! Ugh!!

All the time i kept watching dem!

Good <a href="">#Ai</a> finance

M a simple boy.Watch her dress 😜 n click.

Her words r so mesmerising. I never even noticed she had a second pair of eyes below.

Oh Whts she wearing.... Whts the purpose of those slits

Dnt knw how she became miss world.. Now she had 10 surgeries on face but stil ugly yak... Poor basti girls r much better den des type of miss world.. Without exposing no one can become popular.. Girls wantedly expose to attract attention n den say y r u staring at me

That Cleavage!!!

Cat eyes on her chest😜😜😜.... Next catwomen of Hollywood...She forgot her father in law&#39;s friend was jadoo from the film KMG... And pls we have Rajnikant sir Father of Universe...

Beautiful Priyanka with brilliant mind 😘😘😘

We have an alien in india. Give it up for Jadu!

Those Windows on dress, are Air Conditioners...

Confused dot com girl 👧 She’ll I show 🤷🏽‍♀️ titis or not..
Nangi ho jaa isse acha

mann her  dress is soo distracting

Weren&#39;t you in Krrish? Jadoo did arrive in India
Hay Pri we do have Jadu and PK though

Don&#39;t know what happens to Indian girls accent when they are out of India

Are those boobs I see through boobytraps??

Jaadu is gna abduct her now

Great Priyanka,
Me: there is no <b>mann</b> in <b>&#39;man ki baat&#39;</b><b>Le priyanka: *alien only land in America</b>Zindagi me pahali baar hua hai aisa 😂😂

Such an amazing interview..gosh she is getting better and better! Love u PC😍

Randi ho gai ha
Stunning
she&#39;s a beautiful woman, inside out.. and love cannot be stopped by age... if they are happy with each.. other.. why do people (who i think are actually insecured, narrow minded and terrible)  keep making gross comments about them... i think anyone experiencing the emotion of love is lucky irrespective of age, looks, creed, nationality, religion or any other worldly barriers.. nick and priyanka are living their own life.. get yours too.. every relationship is unique, no outsider can have understanding of it...

What a crazy woman

What is she wearing??....too fashionable and modern. Is she even comfortable in that outfit? 🤔

I&#39;m so happy that she still embraces India.. And there are others ;)

She handled him so well..he was trying to be rude in polite way..that&#39;s why she&#39;s the queen of all hearts

She kept her liberal window open for her fans who use to concentrate on her accent all the time .

Those who says shes fake they are just below her knees .

Easy for Nick .

No wonder she was Miss World and gives beautiful and exact answers

that is probably the ugliest dress I have ever seen

Beauty but not with brain

Aur thoda niche vo gap hota too brown color ke dot bhi dikh jaate

Wahiyaaaaaat Aurat
People who say Priyanka has to fake an American accent to survive in the Hollywood industry are wrong. How did Jackie Chan and Arnold Zchwarzenegger and even Salma Hayek become some of the most successful actors in Hollywood and they can barely speak the language and have very strong accents?

&quot;Aliens only land in America&quot;😂😂😂😂👏👏

All cool ..but why is she wearing a paper clip😂

<a href="">0:47</a> now there&#39;s covid

Then who is Jaadu's sister?
God bless the booby window dress designer

She looks so hot here!!!

I am jus looking at her nipple pokies

People commenting about that how good and powerful america is.....So you people know good english than us because it&#39;s your mother tounge but that english is not saving you from CORONA virus...<a href="">#socalledsuperpower</a>

The accent 😏

It would have been useful if it had been torn and lowered 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Indian women are forgetting to wear clothes. Western style is not that good which disturbs our senses.
I think it isn&#39;t a accent per say.. infact its her pronunciation.. she pronounces every word properly hence she sounds this way which is amazing.. i love the way she sounds! And it definitely isn&#39;t fake!

You guys should have seen her in Mary Com.

Hindi Fuck Teri Man's ass Fuck Teri Man's ass Priyanka Chopra Madarchod Fucked Bharat's name is being tarnished Randi Madarchod
I would suggest Priyanka just to dress properly and be Indian

Was I the only one who found this as really cringy and priyanka trying too hard?

Weldone priyanka
Well u guys must b shocked to hear dat I spent all of my lock down days seeing how she represents India

Hate the outfit... Love her confidence

This girl slays every interview!!!!

Anyone wants to scratch those 2 holes?... Its so in your face... Nice front pockets doh

Indian can&#39;t talk English without expressions &amp; body movements 😂😂

She&#39;s amazing.. XOXO

That&#39;s a cool dress to watch !

i cant stop staring at her boobs they&#39;re saying hello

Now we know why she did The Krish movie....!

Great interview

Pc Faking and Aping an American Accent is So So Cheap...

India has no zombie movies
Why is she talking in fake accent?

5.41 and we got om om om.
She&#39;s amazing ❤️
bollywood won&#39;t allow fr that jacket though !

And people talking about jadoo, pls stop and grow up. She is talking about aliens that attack like the ones in Hollywood. Jadoo is a whole different type 🙄. In fact jadoo was the super hero in this story and happened to land from another planet

Guys stop commenting about her accent for God&#39;s sakes. She grew up in India and America and her accent is influenced by both. That may be the reason she speaks that way. Different people have different accents based on the influence and there is no need to get offended. For example, in India itself there are so many different accents based on the region or mother tongue. But I can&#39;t get offended by an accent different than mine, because that it ridiculous and illogical. Not everyone will have the same accent as me despite being Indian and that&#39;s fine.

That cut on that blazer, could have been an inch and a half lower.

SHE HAS HAD AN ALIEN-INNOVATED BOYFRIEND!!!!!

she forgot about JADU

The final season was ok. But also cheesy. Idk...

She will always be Indian Queen no matter wherever she goes..... Happy holi...... Because today she is in Mumbai playing holi.... 😁😁😁🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
It was really fun to watch this interview

Im just waiting for comments on her suit

Priyanka: I want an alien in India!Jaadu: Am I a joke to you?Edit: Mom I&#39;m famous!

She is just another fat unattractive woman.  What is the big deal over this one?

Her nipples shape is clearly seen. What has happened to today&#39;s actresses. Why such vulgarity? Is she really trying to show it or its just an accident?

Jaadoo to aaya tha India mai

Aliens did land in India but the &quot;Delhi belly&quot; killed them off....

<a href="">2:47</a> her hands are so dark compared to her face and chest

What&#39;s with the tummy tyre!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a mess....ewwwww

I&#39;m sure there&#39;s E.T in India...<b>cough*koimilgaya*cough</b>

Her boobs are pretty wierd now....

As far as Indian women in Hollywood go Priyanka Chopra &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lily Singh

You&#39;re not an artist

What up with that dress??? I mean if u wanna show it then fcking show it but wtf is that???? Lol

PC has got a thing for her tits. Keeps on experimenting around them.

Clicked on this only because of the boob windows

She&#39;s from India I think waoo her English is so Damm perfect

There is something unlikable about her. I just don&#39;t know why or what it is. Don&#39;t care about the whole hiding accent thing. I get it. Like any other ethnic group in the west. She seems like she&#39;d  be a massive karnt if you met her in public. Where as someone like emilia clarke or alia Bhatt just seem like they&#39;d  genuinely be a nice person

These are the pockets??🤤🤤🤤
The accent is so fake, babe u are born and bread in india, be yourself x u are a brilliant actress

Every one saying Indian&#39;s are beautiful and handsome.I opened my front camera and went back to level 5 depression from level 4.

Hollywood&#39;s stereo type is &quot;when it&#39;s the end of the world we are ahead&quot;

She’s getting too old for having a baby 🤰 and soon he will leave her when she  pass 40 with no kids. In middle eastern culture, women passed 35 are considered old and expired. 😼We are doomed. 😔

All praise to God that the world has Priyanka. Sooo wonderful a woman.

It's fun.
I like that she&#39;s not super skinny and embrace her natural skin color

She is getting fat👎👎👎👎
Man i have to admit that seth meyers have a unique charm..

I find it funny how everyone is talking about the Indian accent being heavy while it&#39;s like talking with a weight kept on your tongue when you speak American (for Indians). Indians generally use the tip of their tongue more, while Americans use the base of their tongue when shaping words.(That&#39;s from my experience speaking both accents)

OMG Even boobs..got eyes...🙊
Pry totally forgot abt Jadoo from Koi Mil Gaya

the most beautiful woman on the planet

damn we actually did meet an alien and did dance with it

she is super cute♥♥

In Next costume eye ball will be seeOn breast

Why am I keep looking at her.....?

miss priyanka chopra should buy a hand gun and ammunition bullets immediately!

For those fucktards pointing out her accent let me tell you Kumail Nanjiani,Henry Cavill,Chris Hemsworth,Ryan Gosling,Jason Statham and many more work in Hollywood industry and all of those have adapted to that peculiar accent. You cant work in an entertainment industry where no one can understand you or be a ugly duckling with great body. FYI her accent is not american or fake. It is proper posh Indian accent. One can clearly differentiate words what an american would say and what would indian

Nonsense dress sense...

Without caption I couldn&#39;t understandWith captions on I couldn&#39;t see

Hollywood stereotype:Random Superheroes: &quot;We got to save the world&quot; They only save America.What about rest of the world?

She’s so beautiful. Indian women are phenomenon. I’m a huge fan of her. 💕😋

Shitty dress I don&#39;t understand why she wearing in a talk show

Trying hard what theses two people talking about ..🤣🤣

Any countries needs only whites peoples in a lots of things. What a stupid idea! Looks to her: pretty, delicate, funny, happy, and from what I saw, her characters are credible. I think that she&#39;s endowed with many qualities.

Love you PC
Right nipple is hard smh

She is sooooooo fake. I couldn&#39;t care less about the accent, it&#39;s her demeanor. She&#39;s so annoying.

Her outfit is a masterpiece 😂😂

You just gotta love this woman

She&#39;s so addicting to watch

U will panic and break our into a song 😂

<a href="">

woow nice boob

Don’t like the dress PRIYANKA.

priyanka : i want aliens in india !jadoo: am i a joke to you ?

Hallo Mrs Chopra, whay you Ware very sort dress?

<a href="">

Boob Windows🙏

She forgot about &quot;Jaadu&quot;. The alien that once landed in Himachal and ruined our entire childhood and concept about aliens 😂

Did anyone notice that she has got some weight? Maybe their baby is on the way

Her coat/top is so pretty !❤️

PC is the best where ever she goes!😍😘🤗❤️ Lucky guy Jonas!!!😎

India is super proud of her 💕

Ye kya dress pehna he PC ne

I feel I still get pocket money and I feel like I&#39;m rich 😂😂 so cute 😉😘😘

What about Jadoo PC

&#39;I want Aliens in INDIA&#39; and I was like Hey Buddy me too........

Are those her nipples...😉

Beautiful girl, uncomfortable dress.
I mean.. that dress is just SHITTY!!!When u know , u r beautiful n wanted n popular n a global star, why on earth wud u wanna wear such a stupid dress!Makes no sense! N her nipples can be figured out literally!It&#39;s like a backup for PC, lest i forget my pickup lines, &quot;My dress will do the talking and at the right place!&quot;

Her personality very impressive

Gosh!! If only those cuts were a little bit   down😚

WOW THEY HAVE AIR WINDOWS FOR BOOBS LOL MAYBE SHE EATS TO MUCH GARLIC SHE SMELLS BAD BECAUSE MY NEIGHBORS ARE FROM INDIA 🇮🇳 THEY SMELL BAD EVERYTHING THEY EAT HAS GARLIC..
Hollywood stereotype is they always creat a monster through an experiment that went wrong and then whole America chase to destroy it before it destroys America 😂😂😂

Why is she always dressed like a pornstar

I&#39;m scared on behalf of her dress.

What she is trying to  prove by wearing more scanty clothes than most of her American counterpart?

Overacting overconfidence at its peak.... Her dressing style is just pathetic.. Always.. All show offf... Pc be natural

STILL EVOLVING.

Priyanka Nibbles visible

I think she is fake but i like her anyway because she is cute and good at acting

Nonsense girl

EXTRAORDINARY INTELLIGENT BEAUTY IN FILMY WOULD.......

title of the clip.....the hill&#39;s have eyes........

faking <a href="">accent.lol</a>

I cannot keep focus on her face, her &quot;boob windows&quot; are so distracting

Nowadays she is showing her dark cleavage too much.

Breast window or breast pocket?

Priyanka watch the prequel of your movie series-koyi mil gaya.

🌺🕊glObal peace 4OM BOLLYWOOD of India rsV*p(Brit.Plz.answer)🙏🕘🏌🎶✌.
And now she is on her honeymoon in Tuscany 😂

Priyanka Chopra
Oii what about jaadu??

Which other way can I show more Boob !Yes.

priyanka&#39;s breaking all kinds of stupid stereotypes about India over there. we support! 🙌🏼

I am boss. Quick decistion maker  , my mother i shouted becuse off on every day my perspective i think she do not get it , pschologically i know its have human being pschology  effected.

Hasn&#39;t she seen pk?

Come on. Why is everyone complaining about her accent?  If anybody speaks in my mother toungue incorrectly I surely will get pissed. I expect them to spell the words correctly. Same is the case with English. Its just a process of learning and she&#39;s nailing it. For that matter if you go and spend time around Englishman, its obvious for you to change your accent, knowingly or unknowingly. You people are judging her more for her accent than the English men.

Well.. Thanos went to Africa.. 😷

U look like call girls priank

Had to turn off captions for scientific purposes

Alienes did land in india, Jadoo and PK

Ugly dress... it’s disgusting

Look it&#39;s a BOOB TRAP!!!!!!!!

Aliens know that  where is the monsters😁

She forget to wear bra

&quot;I always get framed cause I&#39;m the brown girl.&quot;

Wow.

PK was an alien.....the only alien to land in India😂😂

I love how she titled Hindi Movies as &quot;our&quot; movies at <a href="">5:16</a>.

Nice t**s

Look a Fake

Guys anyone criticizing her for her accent... But actually the truth is she took an American accent training class for her role in quantico so that she could sound American for the series which was insisted to her by her director which she revealed in one of the interviews... This is being fucking professional not fake.. When it came to deepika she didn&#39;t play an FBI agent!

Priyanka introduced pocket air condition to the world

Rose for rose  dose coz   rose,
So short and so open

Am I the only one who notices her nippies?

This &quot;Era&quot; Say no to &quot;Bra&quot; 😂🤣😁😆😅

Priyanka&#39;s boobs have eyes.. Whoa 😁

&quot;Aliens only land in America.&quot; Did we all forget about district 9?

Kaisa alien tha wo jaadoo bichara kachre ke dabbe jaisa muhh or no agenda ni reason to come on earth gaya bi kha himachal pradesh america jana tha😂😂

What about jadoo

Shame on her look at that her titts.

Priyanka looks like boiled potato

Double slit experiment finally understood!

Hollywood stereotype: zombies always invade America.

I  here just  to watch all her interviews for her outfits!💃😜😎

How can she forget about jadoo the alien ?? She was IN KRISH 2 AND 3

Only priyanka chopra 😇😇😊😊

I see 2 letterboxes

The boob windows take all my attention

In support of women wearing what they want but from a personal point of view, Priyanka actually looks more beautiful in slightly more understated clothes. The problem is that, no matter how much we say that people shouldn&#39;t stare or whatever, the outfit being what it is does distracts from her actual conversation. She can of course wear what she wants, but she doesn&#39;t necessarily need to wear bold or daring clothes - she&#39;s so stunning she could be wearing a full length/sleeve dress and still stand out in a crowd.

I have an accent similar to hers, it develops when you spend your formative years in two placesShe studied in the US so it makes complete sense. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s being fake or putting up an act, ya&#39;ll just nitpicking

Ugly ass suit but she&#39;s gorgeous, what a beautiful woman.

The tailor just forgot to stich pockets..  Sad.

Umm... Did Priyanka forget about Jaadu from Koi Mil Gaya? He is literally an alien that lands in India and is a direct adaptation of ET! How do you forget Jaadu from Koi Mil Gaya? She literally starred in the sequel of that film!

Hey Insult more about Bollywood

YESSS! I get so annoyed. I keep seeing people wear indian outfits and then tag it bollywood. It makes no sense. Bollywood doesn&#39;t mean anything! You can&#39;t wear bollywood clothes.

But Bollywood did have an ET type movie, it was called Koi... Mil Gaya. Priyanka clearly hasn&#39;t done her research on that.

WTF is this dress?

She must be live in US, look like ugly and beggar in this kind of cloth!!

Cool women

Her outfit is a little too small for her.

ok did Preeyanka Jonas just make fun of my lactose intolerance?

Priyanka some time your choice of outfit is very poor..

Worst dress
i found her so much unattractive plus that outfit doesnt fit her fat belly ..it looks🤮

Whats up with her neck

Technically we have an ET. His name is Jadoo. She was in the sequel lol

<a href="">4:15</a>

Is she not wearing a bra o come on priyanka be decent

I love her sense of humor and the way she kicks off back 👍

Aliens only land in America... Lol.. she is very funny 😂😂😂

Maderchodo indiando. Kuttoon
Nipplegate

Well so apparently pk and jaadu were not aliens!!!!

I think I saw her erected nipples😶😶Only I saw that ?

the movie was ET was a concept of sathyajit ray.And the story was based on an alien landed in bengal.

There’s been films about aliens landing in India. Theres koi mil gaya and PK. And they’re both good films.

I don&#39;t get all these hate about her American accent. Her role demanded for it and so she had an American dialect training for that. She has worked hard to speak the way she speaks right now so there&#39;s no such thing as &#39;faking&#39; it. And what upsets me the most is that all this hate comes from us Indians itself. We should all be supporting her for all the fame she&#39;s getting globally. Let&#39;s be real, with the normal Indian accent while speaking English how much recognition did Deepika get in the Hollywood industry? Not everyone can be Kunal Nayyar. So grow up people and learn to respect our &quot;Miss World&quot; who&#39;s always represented our country on a better platform.

Nanga ho Jana ko ko confidence bole hain!
I think she has forgotten to wear cloth

Priyanka to look beautiful you need to be nanga

I can see her nipples

Noticed one thing about her, her clothes are getting shorter and shorter , neckline getting bigger and bigger

I love watching her

This outfit dont do her any good...

I think PC forgot that alien once landed in India and Hrithik Roshan became his best friend and more of brother😂 to know the full story go watch &quot;koi mil gaya&quot;.

KOI MILGAYA has Alien 😂

She is damn intelligent!!

A huge shame on the Indian fellas who are butthurt and shaming her on the dress she&#39;s wearing, on her accent, like fucking stop guys, she&#39;s making us proud, be happy abt that nd cheer her, you guys are disgusting.

Stunning Look Priyanka Chopra

Omg. Wtf is she wearing....

I love u priyanka.. U r amazing personality
U got an alien in India, remember jadooo

Survival of the fittest, u go girl

Ohhh she is now an Hollywood actor

Her jacket got eyes!!but can&#39;t see the pupil...ohh those can roll over the eyes!!

Dhuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
<a href="">5:56</a>

Her dry cleaner destroy her suit pockets
Hasnt she watched the best movie of bollywood? It shows the life of an alien who landed in India. (PK)

Love her !she is very confident!😍😍

Priyankas boobs with cat eyes. how about nipples are retinas. She is a big show off cleavage woman.  I am not into priyanka but there are some darn pretty  actresses in bollywood  really get your head spin.  I wonder priyanka  wear similar outfits in indian shows. if she is what,  will be the reaction from Indian vewers.

Just in case anybody didn&#39;t know, she has breasts.

Titties xD
So thiccc 😍

He’s trying so hard not to look

She is such a powerful, confident, well-spoken lady!

I was gonna mention Koi Mil Gaya, but that literally was E.T but Hindi. Are there any original desi alien films? Like there&#39;s sci fi, but I don&#39;t recall any other ALIEN movies. Even the Krrish series, which Priyanka was IN, barely mention them.

<b>I will break into a song and kick butt how about that?</b> Perfect response 😂😂

<a href="">5:33</a> hilarious.....lol
Host was really good.

She is slaying 😍😍

Her voice is amazing!

Aliens only land in America😂💜

So hard to focus on her face

Bollywood is done for...tollywood was the last hope; but it failed after sen and ray. Period

Her boobs😘😊😍
She should watch Koi Mil Gaya

&quot;Aliens only land in America,&quot; says the girl who starred in the only movie based on aliens(koi mil gaya) in India.

Her talking style is like mahira khan
No shame on me?
&quot;Aliens only land in America&quot;....the question that I have been asking all my life😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I do like her dress style. No matter how much it&#39;s mocked. You gotta agree it&#39;s good.

PRIYANKA WE HAVE JADOO!!

Do people have nothing better to do than comment on what other people wear? Focus on your own lives and let her and others be.

Good question asked why aliens landed only in America

Even I want an alien in India and also an advise fr them beware of Ranveer singh😂😂😂😂

Her dress looks yuck but yeah still I like her ...

Truly said &quot;aliens only land in america haaaaa!!! &quot;

Poor girl can&#39;t even afford clothes without holes in them.

Why is Priyanka Chopra so overrated!!! Can&#39;t deny the fact that, she&#39;s one hard working actress but initially she tried home wrecking two happily married houses for making a stable footing in the industry which only tells me; she is absolutely cunning and immoral who just channelled her slyness to be where she&#39;s and marrying Jonas is one of her many successful plans!

If a poor woman had worn that dress, would she have been called a beggar?

Priyanka says she wants an alien in India, PC did you forget about Jaadu? you are part of the franchise!

Fake American accent

Her dress looks weird..  Halloween dress!!

&quot;break out into a song AND kick butt&quot; YASSSS

We have an alien: &#39;Jadu&#39;.....

Are you awkward to speak about Bollywood Priyanka ?

She and Gal Had it have very similar voices

Wow!! i loved watching her punching back  &quot; hey! im alex paris ill break out into a song and kick butt&quot; 👏👏👏👏👑

I feel like she looks more confident here and she looks more &quot;natural&quot; - i mean she didnt look like she&#39;s trying too hard like in some of her more recent videos / interviews

I used to think her and deepika padukone were sisters so I thought she was deepika chopra🤣 I realized they are not even friends

The desperation to be accepted in US is flowing out of those cut pockets.

I swear she was in an alien movie. Was it koi mil gaya. 😂😂😂

LOL ALIENS IN INDIA DID SHE FORGET ABOUT THE MOVIE KOI MIL GAYA
You had Jadoo....

lol, she may be the indian hit maker in Hollywood that people are talking about now, but in Bollywood we all know the real queen of that film industry is DEEPIKA PADUKONE

Indian peoples complexion is that of poop

Da faq priyanka we have our own etJADOOOOO

When windows 10 gets corrupted ....🤣🤣🤣
Ohhh Bollywood actress in our Hollywood welcome to beautiful land

She has so many confidence

When an alien did land in India, it was named Jadu.

That jacket is a power move. Yas gawd.

Such an ill fitted suit

we love you priyanka..

Spider - Man trapped in there.

Chutiya

Great

What about jaadoo Priyanka???????????looooooooooooooooool

Hey that is the same dress Ariana Grande wore on breathing music video

Good interview priyanka! Oh n America always saves the world :) it’s so true in real life..why does the brown girl always get framed and lose her job?!? Maybe because she’s tough n god has bigger and better things planned than what she currently has!!! You go smart, confident, sassy girl!! Respect ✊

Break out into a song and kick a butt... a very hoo comeback PC

What the kind of vulgar dress is she wears..even copying the western culture dsnt make any sense.They dnt wear these kind of dress. .shame on you....putting lot of accent will.nkt make u sound like Americans. ..speak in neutral or global accent. .Everyone knows you are an Indian..

Can we all take a moment to praise the beauty of this woman? She has a bit of a roll and is as gorgeous as any model who doesn&#39;t.

What&#39;s all the crap about talking American or Fake Accent etc. There is no such language as American, it&#39;s English with an American accent. If you are required to speak English in your Movies, you speak English not Hindi. If you grew up speaking both English and Hindi as your mother tongue languages then you will of course speak better English than most. For goodness sakes grow up people. Pryanka is a Prime example of progress. She&#39;s now lived and acted in several English Movies, done hundreds of Interviews, Programs, Promotions, Overseas goodwill visits etc etc and all of these are conducted in English, so of course she&#39;ll speak with an accent which is neither American nor Hindi, its her own accent which everyone loves and which you people don&#39;t like and Troll her for. Well too bad. She&#39;s done spectacularly well in America and is World renowned now, and is still going strong. Pryanka Chopra Jonas is an Icon and a very Famous, Beautiful, Intelligent Actress/Singer/Dancer, a Philanthropist, an Entrepreneur, Multi Award Recipient both in India and America and more.

She is so confident... I love her... Firangiyo ki bja di... <a href="">#peecee</a>.... My girl crush...

I am so jealous of Nick Jonas because he is now married to this Godess.

Her boobs are Chinese!

Anyone else realised how in the thumbnail she’s much fairer than this video

Yeah but most Bollywood movies are the same tons of songs, almost always a romance even if it&#39;s completely unnecessary, over the top dramatic scenes, and over the top dramatic action. Rarely are there other types of stories. Don&#39;t get me wrong I love Bollywood movies but I&#39;m not gonna lie.

Cat eyes boobs
Pc💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Bad day start of Priyanka

Nice pocket

Y&#39;all better not teach her what accent she should speak in lol..She&#39;s knows how to speak and be understood. Y&#39;all don&#39;t need to be her unwanted strict english language teacher all of a sudden who doesn&#39;t even teach english.

her neck lines r ugly

oh my god yes! They never attack anywhere except America!!

Priyanka is beautiful but the dress not.

somebody forgot jaadu though it wasn&#39;t that big but for 90&#39;s indian kid it was still a magnum opus 😂 😂

That dress is..umm. 🙄

Priyanka forgot we have jadoo from koi mil gaya😂

i find her fashion sense to be a little wonky. She&#39;s never elegant or chic

it actually happened long ago ! alien landed in India ! and then they did break out into a song ! i swear !

The dress is nice and all but that&#39;s definitely not her size.... Sorry not sorry🙄💁

Umm we had jadoo😂
Titties
Bhenchod ye kapde kuch samajh nhi aaye

Who saw the comment to <b>Check her paper clip earing</b> ........I did

OMG I love her so much ❤
You are a true Indian from within ....Stop imitating the western culture....damn it!!! Be yourself priyanka...You are THE Miss World....You forget it I think....Stop saying yaaa yaaa olllll the time...You have become 100%fake now👎👎

A horrible dress
Best caption for her dress- ‘ jeb cut gayi lekin saaman buch gaya’ 😂Translate- ‘ she was pickpocketed but her stuff is still safe’ !

Show Priyanka ji what all you got :)
Her boobs outgrew their previous size and the pockets couldnt sustain the tension.

shes so hotttttt wow

Why is everybody so concerned about accents? She&#39;s from the other side of the earth, OBVIOUSLY there&#39;s going to be a variation. God fucking dammit. Even Indians are pulling her down for &quot;trying&quot; to sound American. I bet if you were in her place you would too. (AND suck at it)

We do have aliens in India like Swara Bhaskar and Rahul Gandhi, Alia Bhat, lol...

Nooo pc how could you forget about jadu , I mean he landed in India and is an alien and also India&#39;s most famous alien

Show boobs, upto just short of the tipping point, &amp; try to be accepted as a celeb or just as one of the Americans, &amp; not an outsider from India.Wow, Priyanka! You&#39;re surely making India proud with your choices.

she really want to distract everyone by her top from her stomach really PC you should loose weight

Alien in India? We have &#39;jadu&#39; did you forget? 😉

The most fake person......loads of lies, her deceits ended her Bollywood career

OMG.. SHE&#39;S NOT REALIZED THAT HER JACKET IS UNSTICH 😂😂😂😂
wtf is up with her outfit? It looks too small, uncomfortable, and with boob slits (which was never a fashion). Fire your stylist.

0.8 to 0 .40..there her nipples showed

Such a gorgeous woman and you dress her up in that crappy thing..chee...

A naughty rat must have cut her clothes in boobs area.

Did anyone notice , Ariana Grande wore the same coat in her music video &quot;breathin&quot;

Ummmm does Priyanka not remember the fact that she was in Kkrish! She already had her alien in India ... his name was Jadoo

I love that commenters try to reduce a talented woman who has traveled internationally, produced and acted in 50 movies in India and starred  in her own show on American TV to a comment about her pockets or a critique on the way she speaks. Hilarious really, because you know their personal accomplishments totally pale in comparison. It’s such a modern illness to nitpick others.

wow...what a passion of her dress😠😠😠😠

She is really great, love her hair, watched her on another Late Night show and her hair was in a completely different cool style

We have jadoo we don&#39;t need et shitty😂

The thing is I never read the caption of a video..if I see PC in the thumbnail of a video..then I have to see it ❤️

She is cool.... Lover her, but I don&#39;t like her dress...😶

She is as always amazing

It&#39;s actually funny coz she&#39;s starred in Krrish series

Showing her nipples  through underneath dress ,she could have use nude cups .. worst dress choice

Same blazer wore by Ariana Grande in breathin video

She is behaving soooo confidentally

Priyanka u r amazing
I liked how the interview goes my Queen greetings . I encourage you in all your efforts as a woman with a lot of responsibilities. I missed the scene because of a spell (Mama Lucy spirit mind control) someone cast on me all these years , make me not getting job for what I school for , getting hates every place where  help may come from etc.Shalom

PC is best....😘😘

Piggy chops.. proud of u....thank you for bringing out point that Bollywood is way more than dancing

Alien 👽 landed  India in 2003 his name is Jadu and it&#39;s gave power to hrthik roshan. Now he can fly all over the world without passport ... Lol.... How could u forget this legendary movie  koi milgaya priya

Only Priyanka can dare to wear that dress bcoz she is so care free with it.lov u.

What an awful attire, PC!

Nonsense dress👎👎👎
She’s annoying

Looking at her dress it seems like she is losing it! Be careful PC. What builds also destroys!

She is very intelligent and she deserve for Hollywood movies. Nobody can kick her . She is best

fake accent

smart intelligent but that jacket is just a tip away from being vulgar!

<a href="">5:33</a> Thank You!

Hey! Bollywood has several alien movies!! Anyone remembers these amazing movies koi mil gaya n pk!!

Boob pockets

Omg her dress.... N wats showing...

Don&#39;t disrespect jaddoo like his Priyanka, yeh anyaay hai :(

People r Soo negative here.. Some ppl really need to chill and if u ppl can&#39;t say good things then plzz don&#39;t spread hate as well.. PC is🔥and u haters r not even 1% of her...

God! I love this woman.

Sry mam bt why do u wear such clothes?? Does it make u feel u look hot?? Such a pity...

<a href="">4:15</a> 😵
The misconception applies for kpop. It&#39;s been reduced to a genre when it&#39;s actually an industry.

What about Jadoo dude??HOW CAN YOU BETRAY JAADOO?! 😱

aliens in india? is she forgetting koi mil giya Lol

Like for her answers and the way she answers. No doubt why she became Miss World and leading lady in Hollywood.

She is a rockstar🔥🔥 in India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳!!
Common aliens please land in India for a change.

Pakistani Actress Sonya Hussain Exactly Looks Like Priyanka Chopra<a href="">
i want an alien in india and im just like excuse me jaadu?????

2 eyes n face and 2 eyes on boobs

She actually worked in the sequel of an alien movie

If she really was confident she wouldn’t have worn such a ridiculous dress!Dresses like this ensures ppl won’t take you seriously.

Hey I&#39;m Italian and your Italian is so good!! You sounded perfect when you were speaking in Italian

Hi

Her dress is really distracting

I don&#39;t know but something about seems fake 🤨

I am big fan of this queen but I can’t accept her in this an open dress because she knows very well that many people follow her n encourages by motivational speeches..  um from  Bangladesh

Ahhhh such a beautiful lady n artist she is like I just love her personality 👌👏👏💗

&quot;I want an alien in India!!&quot; Same Pri, same.

She&#39;s cool!

She is so cool. I love her!

LOVE FOR FR PC

so much distracting 🙄
You forgot your very movie Krish which is a sequel of koi mil Gaya where aliens land on India 😑

She is doing it over and over, why don't you wait?
Wardrobe malfunction?

Finally she is here without being fake

That must be so hard for him to not look below her neck

Speaking as a gay guy, I can&#39;t help but look down to her breasts

Just a matter of Showing Nipples😁😁😁They are willing to come out 😍😍

I love the way she speak with so much confident

Priyanka Chopra is always super

What a terrible dress...  just trying to be honest.

I don&#39;t hate her but that dress is really hideous. Why cuts in the chest????

Well P. K. landed in India, didn&#39;t he???

She has several cosmetic surgeries, with money. ..

Open your eyes look at my two breasts, that&#39;s the message from the dress.

Do not like what she is wearing

Woooo my queen
Jaadu was ET!!! How did she not remember that!? She worked in the sequels! 😂😂😂😂

Deepika only wishes she slayed as hard as PC

Aliens always land in America. Ancient cultures that are non white   are always built by aliens ie Pyramids built by aliens 👾

Nipples need air

Look at her hand on the table <a href="">5:41</a>Thank me later

She is so confident we should  proud of her... hit the like button if you too...

Bollywood refers to that segment of Hindi movie industry that produces movies with music and dances. So really, Bollywood does really refer to a genre of films. The ones without dances are South Indian, Tollywood etc. Bollywood-flavored popcorns are popcorns that make you do a happy dance.

She is very intelligent and carries herself well.

Pandya's teacher
Sakhu bai... 😂
Be shy woman
Very Hot Provocative Priyanka Chopra 

I wonder how did he control his eyes 😂😂😉 Love you PC

She is so smart .

I didnt hear a single word they were talking even though i paid a lot of attention on the content they were showing 😂

You are not bound You are free to make your decision anytime... God bless u take care

&quot;Hey I&#39;m Alex Parrish! I will break into a song and kick butt! How about that&quot;. Now this was hilarious.

Her voice was super duper

She&#39;s false actually... koi mil gaya is bollywood version of E.T. and apparently she hasn&#39;t watch it.

I love that dress

I always ask myself why Aliens👽 go to America why they don&#39;t came here on Balkan.Then I realise we have our politicans😕

BROWN WOMEN ARE LITERALLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN ON EARTH. THEY HAVE WHAT WHITE WOMEN WANT THE MOST(tan skin) and what black women want(naturally straight hair).

Pk landed in india ....you forgot !!!! Koi mil gyea ....

Bold of her to say Bollywood doesn&#39;t have aliens when she herself starred in a movie which was a sequel of a movie inspired by ET.

Who got it???
her talking way...just superb

grey alien 👽

Click-baits!!!!
She looks like man

Omg what is she&#39;s wearing

What would a &quot;Hollywood&quot; flavour be? Kale.

You make India proud, Pc

How could she forget that she did a sequel (Krish) of a movie (koi mil geya) where aliens did land in India??! 😂😂😂

I love that her fat is there all, these people want bones as the social standard for beauty but she BEAUTIFUL as a woman with more meat, anyone is beautiful more or no meat 😍

Indians criticizing her accent, I mean, if she speaks with an Indian accent many of us in the west wouldn&#39;t understand her.

I love the way she says &quot;In India&quot; 😍😍😍

I thought she had paperclips on her ears for a sec LMAOOO

She forgot about Jaadu!!!!

She&#39;s such a goddess

Guess she selectively forgot about Jaadu 😂

Her outfit is freaking me out

she is true.... alien only lnded in america HAHAHAHAHA

She is showing too much flesh. Very pretty woman.

#39;s great at impersonating accents.. from Indian,  to British to American 🤣

LOVE YOU PRIYANKA!!! :D ♡♡♡ Your so beautiful, very talented, do different movies in India now in America!!! :D ♡♡♡ You are sure breaking stereotypes and soon others will too such as more Indian male and female stars/actors, Japanese stars, Mediterranean/Nepal stars and so on!!! :D ♡♡♡ You will for sure get accepted soon by everyone a diverse community we say!!! :) ♡♡♡

We have our desi alien ✌ <b>Jadu</b> ✌
Why her clothing designer gave her boobs an eyes?

<a href="">4:13</a>  to <a href="">4:17</a> she&#39;s growling.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 XD LOL

You must have wore something better

What dress is that

Nation must be first ....u were once proud of our nation....

Mom, the shirt!^^
Very good at speaking. Funny how she is switching accents. But the dress could be better)

Cringy jokes
Wtf is she wearing?

The only part i liked was when Seth says &quot;Yea that&#39;s true&quot; to the alien allegation

Her accent is something else

ye world sax worker he
She has been dispelling the same myth ever since she got to hollywood.. I donno y its still a myth!! 😧

brown

Indian women show off more skin and boobs than white women once they become famous in the west.

Priyanka proud of u, love the way u r......😘

are those boobs seeing me!! or i am seeing them!! OMG no offense just kidding hahaha

she dispelled something personal, ofcourse &#39;those&#39; may be bollywood&#39;s property

Shame on you Priyanka you traitor!
Airport Security was checking her pockets if she carries any DRUGS.

the tiddies....
Bharatiya Sanskriti needs to be shown, it needs to be learned completely.
stop reading comments watch video first 9😀😀

Fake nose fake lips and everything Oddly she has small tits for an Indian woman

wnt to be like her....

Can you bring Ravi Dubey too

Sorry about that dress

OMG she is sooooo beautiful 😍😘

Hollywood flavored popcorn would be a mix of flax, kelp, and cocaine.

« Aliens only land in America » 😂😂

Her prominent nipples are a cause of distraction 😂

her tits have eye&#39;s 👀👁

Nipple is mighty close to cut out

Wow confident hai...suprebb

Height of fashion, hide everything except your private parts 👌

I like priyanka but i x lik her dressing way..😐

He&#39;s trying so hard not to look at her.. top.

And her show got cancelled.

We had a alien from koi Mil gaya

I will break out into a song and kick butt. CLASSIC COMEBACK

she is so beautiful! my gosh!

I like this interviewer.. and jimmy Fallon. Some interviewers are way too rude and try to mock every indian guest. So yeah

She seems to have a great personality. Loved the interaction with the host.

Why is everyone angry about her accent? I live in US for 6 years, I fake my accent too. Language is for people to understand, try ordering filter coppee or Chaya with milk and extra jugar in restaurant in US, you will know what I am talking about

So confident. 😍
You are mine

SHE&#39;S SO BEAITIFUL 😍
We had Jadu tho

<a href=""> CHOPRA WAS THE FIRST BOLLYWOOD STAR TO PROPAGATE HOMOSEXUALITY.. WHITE JEWS WHO RUN HOLLYWOOD LOVE HER..<a href=""> ABOVE LINK IN WEBSITES OF ---PRIYANKA CHOPRA AJIT DOVAL PMOPMMODIRAJNATH SINGHHOME MINISTRYNIRMALA SITARAMANDEFENCE MINISTRYCJI
ya all that good, but why there are cuts on her boobs. brown woman discovered new trend....lol

Ugh, she reminds me of those bratty english medium school kids....

Rushvi langalia -is my channel name .I also made channel ...inspired by u...for do something in life

She looks beautiful 😍😍😍 as always.

Did she forget about jadoo...

That&#39;s disrespectful of Seth to say that she will be going to a dance the minute an alien lands in India. Way to stereotype boy!

Watch all Aishwarya Rai interviews. Nobody can replace her.

you look gorgeous but this dress code looks like more for breastfeeding ..... bad taste it doesnt look sexy but too trashy

Her boobs has a Chinese eye

I love  you  priyanka
<a href="">4:15</a>

OMG she is looking fat what happened to her?

Come on priyanka, we have &#39;jaadu&#39;.Heck, u had jaadu.🤔

Most beautiful skin ever!!!ugh!

Where are the godamn nipples???

her neck looks older

She is not just beauty, she is beauty with amazing brain. Totally genious, the way she responses to all questions is perfectly amazing. Yeah why, aliens alway landed in America lol?? Haha

The host has done a great job

OMG,too smart.the best.

She is almost nude nd she will start nude scenes in Hollywood movies

See her dress 👗 and she is pride of India

He girl i love u
We have one thing that  Americans will never have &quot;JAADU&quot; 😂😂😂😂

Did I see belly rolls?

What’s with her accent? She doesn’t talk like that when she’s in India. She tries so hard to fit in US

Can people focus on her personality rather than her dress?

I came here for those boobies

Peek-a-boo&#39;b!

fat and ugly and torn clothes............

How weird is her costume. Duh. She doesnt need to seek attention by showing off that much

We have Jaadu👽

Such fake accent gir&quot;llllllllll&quot; !

Love you Priyanka Ji 😍
I personally like her but not the dress.

I love her so intelligent

im just concerned about how that thing shes wearing is so tight!

How come everyone needs to criticize her dress instead of appreciating her personality!

She&#39;s ugly yet pretty confident

Watch Priyanka at royal wedding<a href="">

She’s brilliant!!!

This lady is a slap on the face of the Bollywood and the shitty Hindi speaking people thanks Priyanka

She is awesome

That dress though 🔥🔥🔥

Bollywood&#39;s veena malik

She spoke so well....

She’s been my favorite actress since childhood! So cool to see my different worlds colliding ♥️

Is Bollywood flavoured popcorn supposed to be spicy popcorn?

This was fun to watch. No awkwardness between them.

Who designed her dress. Really

Shes fine by
I love how deep and husky her voice sounds. Super sexy!! ❤😍😍

Break out into a song and kick some ass lmao that&#39;s sounds about as Bollywood as possible xD

Her dress 😂😂

on a side note Trader Joe&#39;s Bollywood flavored popcorn is really good

the most horrible dress ever :O

She is love 😍

Wht abt jaadu man!!!!?
Never seen tit slits before... I like em! 👍

i love her soooo much she is really my queen

Top is so tight , not a nice dress

Clicked because she’s gorgeous.Stayed for the right nipple

I am so proud of you priyanka

Priyanka jammed that guy...

PRIYANKA IS MY INDIAN VERSION OF WONDER WOMAN!That says it all...

Amazing always enjoy watching her interviews pri is fantastic 👌👍

Her belly looks so cute

She has the right to wear whatever she wants...we are no one to criticize

Priyanka is looking so fat

She needs to do sit test before coming on shows the outfit doesn’t look good when she’s sat down

I hope she knows Quantico is cancelled 😂

Did anyone notice that her earning is actually a paper clip.(corporate look) 😍😘

Don&#39;t look at her boobs coz they too seeing u😂😂

Panic and breakout into a song! yeah! that&#39;s how we handle aliens in India 🙄😑

wardrobe confusion?

Dress is not matching for priyanka

One can easily make out her erected nipples under tht suit

<a href="">5:40</a> nd i m still singing...jaaduuùu...jaaaadu...jaaadu....jaàdu..
Alien boob shirt
Nipples pointing out oopps
Also I don&#39;t know why so many people have a problem with what she&#39;s wearing, I like it!!

Westerners have SO many misconceptions about Indians films, it&#39;s crazy (I&#39;m a Westerner myself). Hollywood isn&#39;t a genre so why would people think Bollywood is? lol

Yeah, All i could do was feel for Seth who had to keep his vision above her nose from checking out those boobs slit . And she cautiously keeping her thighs closed and skirt hems in place

Aaah she is so beautiful, inside and out!

Straight forward n honest

look at her Nipples 😛

she looks so good, but the suit is a little tight go a size bigger honey

Why is she dressed like a Randi, I mean why don&#39;t they dress like that on Indian TV shows? What compelles them to expose more as soon as they go to USA?

I love her but didn&#39;t like her outfit

How does seth Meyer able to concentrate on her eyes?

india had jaadu
Note to self: Priyanka Chopra and Priya Rai are different people.

I Love those Eyes...

Many are

I see a cat 🐈

Beautiful priyanka hot big Boob&#39;s Boob&#39;s bra

she is funnnnn

I just love the fact that she also believes that even though India is not economically developed, the country has it&#39;s own essence ... of which we should be really proud,  and everyone gotta respect India.... she killed his bullets with elegance!!!! Only you could do that girl..... 👍❤💋

Poor outfit
So true ..... Aliens only land in America 😂😂😂😂

My hands are cold

She is not correct. We do break out into synchronized dancing in 99.5% of all of our movies. I love those songs. Actually, I wish everybody breaks out into dancing on the streets, I mean, that defines who we are. Why does she have to misrepresent who we are?

I hv seen aiswariya roy to be trolled in a show in hollywood . .   That time they actually trolled the indians. . . bt she could not give them a good reply. . . . . But WITH MY PRIYANKA CHOPRA. . . People always thinks twice before trolling her.  . . Because she always replys with a bomb that sometimes makes them step backwards. . . . PRIYANKA I LOVE U MY GIRL. . . .  U R THE PRIDE OF INDIA. . . . . KISSESS N HUGS :)

shes so cheap...fake ...wearing a feeding bra jacket ..horrible

she just nailed it

Why are her hands darker than her face and chest? Is she bleaching?

she&#39;s strong

Not framed because she is the &quot;brown girl&quot;.  Her character never follows orders.

pls wear full dress .. because ur Indian....

Aliens only land in America 😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍
People say bihari&#39;s are backward and use bihari as a gali.... Look priyanka now!!

what is she wearing? I can calculate volume and area of her boobs easily just by looking.

You HAVE an alien in India 😂😂 Koi Mil Gaya

Can she wear it in India?

The JACKET 😱

I just love to watch all her talkshows😍 she is successfull AF! And what is so interesting about it is people abroad accepts her very well and entertained by her. It shows her worth as a celebrity.

This women make me wants to be like her ..

Baby Jesus

hey i am alex parish

HELLO SIS, DID YOU FORGET ABOUT JADU?
Easy on the brush Strokes lady! That makeup is wearing her.

Just looking at this chick, I&#39;m experiencing that Bolly wood. 😉

She is so adorable💕

She would make an amazing Captain America when Chris Evans is done with the role.

PC is ma favourite!!!But I personally feel she looked fat in dat dress😜

She ain&#39;t just a pretty face

Aree Priyanka PK hai ka.?

Love her blazer

I really wanted to ask that question to an Englishman &quot;why aliens land only in America&quot; ...thanks Priyanka 👍💝😂

God damn I wanna make babies with her.

Priyanka, love, let us watch District 9 together

She got 2 nice pocket in her jacket .

I was so scared for her nipples....could have popped out any moment and she wouldn&#39;t even know

Never heard of her. But that&#39;s definitely a chick fighting hard against the inevitable fat growing around her neck and ewww places. Smell like Duck Butter.

Is she wearing a safety pin in her ear?

priyanka chopra❤❤❤
What a fun interview! Beauty and personality ❤

Ye do ankhe kam thi kya Jo do air bana li ....over actor PC..... Jabardasti idhar ghus ri h

Here for her confidence, the way she talks omg it&#39;s amazing 😍

So much for the fake accent.. way to go piggy chops!

I didn't see much but I felt happy after seeing them.
