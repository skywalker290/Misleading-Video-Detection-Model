Boring trailer

Fake

Wait this is not the trailer of bunty aur babli 2. Cause the first clip was from jawani jaaneman and then one clip of rani mam was from the song ab toh forever. And stop all this fake things. Bunty aur babli is legendary. I am gonna report your channel

Upcoming biggest flop......

Abhishek Bacchan
Abhishek Bacchan
I disliked because I wanted Rani Mukherjee and Abhishek Bachchan pair in Bunty Babli
I missing Rani together on big screen with1.Abhisek Bachan 2.Viviek Obroi3.Shahid Kapor4.Hritik Roshan..Sending much love from Malaysia <a href="">#Rani</a> fans.

Finally.. nearly all times in movies heroines/girls are replaced.. atleast they kept rani ma&#39;am 

<a href="">0:32</a> it&#39;s from Aiyaa movie.

fake trailer

Rani is Rani

FAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKEFAKE

Yey there will be a second one... Love Rani Mukherjee, Saif Ali Khan, and also Abhishek Bachchan
Dislike as much as possible.
Boycott yrf who produces nepotistic movies!!!!

Let&#39;s stop watching nepotism group ppl movie. They do not have guts to take stand for SSR /kangana. No unity in bollywood. Boycot them

Just keeping making the remake of the same movies, so tired of this shitty approach. These people have no new stories to tell or what ‚ÄçÔ∏è

WTF

Senior nepo kids ... But boycott continues

Abhishek kicked out

BYCOTT Karachi wood

Shamelessly ruining a good movie .Bunty aur Babli was a good one but it&#39;s sequel should be Boycotted.

Abhishek

Boycotting

Brother, I don't have any problem with Rani, I have a problem with her husband, Aditya Chopra, he is also the material of nepotism, Rani mam is a very good actress, she works hard for that, I don't want to say anything.
Niceeee

BOYCOTT

This is not official trailer it has clips from jawani janeman
