HA! He 3 months late? Am 3 years late.

God bless everyone and have a good day,.

i watched this when it cam out and im drunk and it was on auto play thought this was goin to be bout meams but i gotta say thease are my favourite type of videos from you

Felix: Why Joacim called Wokin not JokinAlso Felix: My name is Showlburg (Written Kjellberg) ......

get a load of this society

Joaquin is Spanish, you dummy.

Great film

the point about the media saying &quot;hey.. we think something bad is going to happened .. and we will broadcast it when it does&quot;

I guess we truly do live in a society 😔

I want to Fuck a watamelon in society AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

We live in Jared Leto

<a href="">2:18</a> bruh
Get a load of this society.

Coming back to this movie and realizing it’s philosophies give you an outside perspective on our world as a whole, and how corrupt it is (whether we like it or not). I could ramble on and on forever, but for now, I’ll just leave you with the fact that it’s not changing, the ideas of the Joker still effect society

I never saw the movie but I think Joaquin is  a great actor I love him.

You’re right PewDiePie

Was expecting a meme review, got a short video essay instead about media sensationalism. What a pleasant surprise.

LMAO

Good stuff.
KEK

Pewdiepie and Joaquin both Scorpios they’re like a few days ago

Pewdie why you don&#39;t talk about legend heath ledger
I&#39;m a simple person : I see the Joker, I click.

felix is seriously woke

more voice overs pleeeeaaaase
what&#39;s the background music to this video?

Bruh the thing is that the joker movie wasn’t even that violent compared to other r rated movies. The kill count was not even too high, it wasn’t about starting violence or murdering it was simply about mental health and the effect it has on people and that we don’t know how to help people with it. The media created the issue of it being “too violent” and a year on, any murders inspired by it were like u said a direct fault of the media.

The media would have loved nothing more than chaos for people watching this film. That&#39;s why they hyped it up so much. &quot;Never let a crisis go to waste&quot; , that&#39;s their motto. The media is enemy #1 in America!

the guy who calls jubilee as yubilee is asking why joaquin is not pronounced as JhO-ah-quin

Thank you for your open minded insight about current events and world culture. I wish more people would take this mindset, or atleast keep themselves more open minded, regarding all issues that affect our daily lives and how that meshes with our perspective on the world at large. Thanks Felix.

I have to say this movie is the best I have Watch this movie about 5 times it’s so gooddddddd

I loved this one

It’s almost like the media wanted a terrorist attack to happen so they could push there narrative… 🤔

These kind of video is the kind of video that reminded me that im not smart

We live in a Society

My uncle was actually a responder during the aurora shooting. My dad has always made us sit near the doors since. He also usually stashes a pistol in the car as well. It’s interesting to think about those ripple effects and how it overall contributes to the American paranoia

This video was soo well made, i would watch this before sleeping

He should be called joceem pheonix - felix kajellberg

can we get a church for the bros

based

JOEKA!

at first i thought man this guy kinda looks like pewdiepie. then i checked the name of the account 😩

I don&#39;t really like it when people try to make &quot;deep&quot; comments about this movie.

OMG the squidward is the Joker?

The joker recieved before it&#39;s release what fight club had received after its release.

pewds has done a voice reveal

O what I didn’t realise it was pewds until half the vid

this video really societies my joker

Wait you are not PewDiePie

Joaquin is a Spanish name pronounced like “huwakeen,” but English isn’t perfect for this, so we pronounce it like “wakeen.” Joaquin originally came from a Hebrew name, “Joaquim” which is the name of Jesus’s grandpa

Romero: We live in a society that presents itself as bright and pretty to hide it’s dark, ugly truth.Nicholson: We live in a society therefore our criticisms of society are invalid.Hamill: We don’t live in a society. Good and evil are two sides of the same eternally flipping coin just like me and Batman.Ledger: We live in a society that’s doomed to collapse into anarchy. Phoenix: We live in a society that manipulates, abuses and abandons the poor, the indigent and mentally ill.Leto: Riding an Internet meme.

I’m sure poods can relate with Joaquin bc there both shy

Damn. Her is such a good movie lol

Your conclusion is perfect, i actually said many times that the media was begging for a shooting to happen, cuz that&#39;s what media do, they make money out of other people&#39;s problems

This is the reason why I love Pewds. He can be a funny, sarcastic fun guy. But he can be aaserious serious and intellectual guy when he needs to.

This is like my smart ass classmate doing a presentation

remove random critss

How many of you got simply guitar ad

I cant with how pewds says Joaquins name

In the middle of the vid I completely forgot that I was watching a pewdiepie vid

joker is one of the best films of all time

the joker is fucking awesome.

Rather see him react on the movie tho. Who cares what the media depicts? Its a life long irritating story which never ends.

Holy shit i didnt even know this was pewdie...... holy shit u sound different. Much better

It was clear to me that Felux is an intelligent human being, but this didn&#39;t hurt

<b>society</b>

i didnt knew it was a video from pewdiepie until almost finish the video lol

tbh, i love this pewds than the normal one for some reason. its also way engaging.

This is my favourite video that u have made

We live in a society

These are his best videos

The voiceover artist sounds a lot like PewDiePie.

More of these. PLEASE

Pyro?

back then people didn’t like how joker could influence someone.Also them: they love the harley quinn movie &gt;:(

whyyyyy sooooooooo serious
Wish Felix made more videos like these. Besides being nice to see his perception about things, the more sober and mature approach gives more content variety and allow people to know a little better about him

&quot;Joaquin is weird&quot;Him, to stupid b&quot;tch: &quot;I believe you never cried in your life&quot;Me: SAVAGE 🤘

cool

The media controversy over Joker is the perfect example of people looking for an enemy and having to make due.

if your a human  don&#39;t be one

The character of the joker has been around for decades, with little to no incidents. One movie is not going to change that 🙄

The ending tho... nicely done!

ai felix
The Mainstream Media is the cause of actual violence.

We live in a society. Where honor is a distant memory, isn’t that right, Batman?

I started watching Pewdiepie as an adult, and I always like it when he drops the act and you see he’s not just the shallow screaming letsplayer for 12 year olds that popular media portrays him to be.

pewdie is here
We need felix alway be like this. He intelligence. Most people want him act 9 yo. Why

this better then watchmojo

write my english essays for me
wow This is great

Greatest synced intro yet

The media was going insane about the joker because they know millions if not billions of people would be extremely happy if the tv studio scene happened IRL.When multimillionaires working for multinational corporations are openly encouraging violence on dissidents for ratings, it’s what they deserve.Let’s not forget them falsely claiming a pyrotechnic event was war breaking out in the Middle East, hoping for invading them and drone strikes against citizens.

damn, i bet u r good on podcast felix

Paul MIller after watching the Joker:

the reason why Joaquin didn&#39;t win an Oscar  is not because he is weird, it&#39;s because there were actors that year who gave better performance. that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that Joaquin is a bad actor. Oscar means the best performance of the year, not good performance of the year.

Joaquin is pronounced the way it is because it’s not an English name 😂 I believe it’s Latin?

Joker is the greatest villain ever

I personally believe the dark knight rises joker is the best becuase he acts like how you’d think a deranged person would act

this was deep for pewdiepies standards

“I don’t believe you’ve ever cried in your life”w̶h̶a̶t̶
<b>we live in a society</b>

This is perfect. Something that I needed for now.&quot;Truth&quot;, I guess. Gotta find other things like this.

the media is lying, always lied and WILL always lie in the future

can anyone give me the link to any more of these kinds of video

This comment section is aids

Joker is not the person who born like that. But he become one because of society.

I designed the legend that if you follow me, coronavirus will never hit you, never take advantage of the offer

I checked twice is this really felix, he really is big brains.

Who’s here after the Snyder cut trailer 😎

I have never seen the media want a shooting to happen so bad just to prove their point

I’m a year late 😂

“We live in a society, where honor is a distant memory”

This meme is mainstream now. Its canon .......LOL

The media when a serious movie about Joker comes out: <b>panik</b>The media when a lighthearted movie about his just as crazy GF comes out a few months later: <b>kalm</b>

justice league jared leto stand by bitch

Here after the Snyder cut trailer

Big brain big peepee he has it all

JOKER DID IT!!SNYDER CUT!!

I was very much surprised to see such a video from you... a well made one.

Here after the Leto&#39;s Snyder Cut preview.

i like this format he needs to do more of this

That moment when the joker says &quot;we live in a society&quot; in Zach Snyder&#39;s Justice League

Who&#39;s here after the Syndercut trailer release today😂😂

Lmao who&#39;s here after SnyderCut trailer? After &quot;We live in a society&quot;?

get load of this society

btw wasn&#39;t one of the john wick movies released a few months before joker, they didn&#39;t panic about that.

I had to check if this was actually a PewDiePie video

honestly pewds should do more voice over vids

walk out of that question...........boom boom now let me hear you say way ho.........way ho

Pewds 2 months late I’m 1 year late to watch this video

fuckenn hell i love this

my 1 and a half years later still waiting for more philosophy and book review episodes :(

Felix is doing video essays now? How did I missed that??

as much as I love the memes, I really love the videos where he talks about stuff like this and gives us an insight into his thought process. it&#39;s super interesting.

Piewdiepie.Reasoning : 300 lvlThat&#39;s why he is the number one youtuber.

<a href="">7:57</a> Case In point Trump and the media.

PewDiePie is so big brain.
this reminds me of Luka Magnotta

I love what you say pews

I feel like I&#39;m watching watchmojo

This video completely predicted the reverse face reveal. WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

pewds when are u doing a face reveal

Ok but I&#39;m here wondering what it would be like if Pewdiepie were to act as the Joker-The face structure, the laugh everything-

Thanks felix, I&#39;m going to copy this for a school project

im watching this in 2021

Why is it stated as fact that &quot;hatred will always exist&quot;.

hey felix, i know you’re on break, but you mentioned to make a video on just joaquin phoenix, and i think that’d be awesome

I am 10 and this is toooo deep

So the media point is entertaining make people violent

In reality, we have The Memer. So many people copy the character it&#39;s disgusting.

You said bom bing

and also joaquins name is spanish

probably because he never won one is because he’s weird

Hold the fuck up, a schizophrenic pyromaniac who burnt down a building after WW2, that reminds me of team fortress 2PYRO IS JAPANESE

this is great The media: the dark night rises is going to make people want to mimic the jokers actionsThe people: Im the joker baby The media: Omg the joker is going to make people mimic his actionsThe people: lets go dance on some stairs

Still waiting for his vid on Joaquin :(

Movies and Video games cause violence: Said every Karen ever

me and my dad went to see the joker, he said once he saw joaquin in the cast he immediatly realised the movie would be...you knowedit: also i saw the 2002 movie &quot;signs&quot; which also has joaquin in it

pewds: Jared leto won an oscar and brought dead rats, used condoms and anal beads on setalso pewds: joaquin phoenix didn&#39;t won an oscar beacause he was wierd

Mass media and journalism is just a business in the end, they don&#39;t care if the informations they give aren&#39;t 100% true,  they don&#39;t care about consequences they may cause or destroying a person&#39;s image. It&#39;s just a matter of money. I hope in the future the information and news will be generated by a computer intelligence.

3.1k clearance
negligible
Felix: Seiriously, why can&#39;t we just call him Joeceem Phoenix. English language, please.Ok, Fellix Kellbög

I still haven&#39;t gotten around to watching this movie.

I&#39;m ashamed that I used to dream working on a big news outlet

It’s just about real issues with society and mental health how does that cause violence

I want more of this

can anyone count how many times pews say &quot;we live in a society&quot; in the video??

Gawd Damnit Felix. This is so much more relevant than it ever deserves to be.

Why this movie is dangerous this is perfect bro

DC❤️❤️❤️
Those rumors were fake tho ....Jared never said that.

dude this guys channel is a mix of everything

Birdman evolved
We hope we get more such vids from pewds❤️

I think I have clicked the wrong channel.I don’t think this is the pewds I know

S A M A J

Its a different type of a video. A unique one. Nice thinking poods.

he is like pyro in his early days

i love this type of video format

E

Is it just me Or i hear &#39;quaking&#39; Phoenix
I’m still waiting for Felix to make a video essay on Joaquin Phoenix.

Don't be too seasoned, Meatballs
Felix in this video : bIg  bRaIn  🧠🧠

This is some LEMMINO level shit

The negativity of that society ridiculed and hurt Arthur&#39;s insanity.So it gave birth to the infamous Joker.I think the movies message had to do with Mental illness,Society,and even Insanity.

never saw a pewdiepie voiceover, im surely amazed and surprised, really loved it

The biggest thing I got from this video was that Joaquin Phoenix was in Brother Bear.

Kill everything

<a href="">2:54</a> I wonder how they thought that the Joker movie might have copycat killers. I mean, I have never seen a movie about school shooting

I ain’t gonna lie, I’m all for more video essays from Pewds.

We live in a society.

<a href="">4:10</a> 😂😂😂

This is so not pewds video

It&#39;s funny how a machete brawl happened out side of Froze 2 but not outside of Joker lol

Idk why but it really bothers me that I ain’t able to see his face during this vid. I get he was tryna get a message thru for viewers to listen to but ya it was just weird

Imagine Joaquin hosting meme review J : how about a joke felixF : <b>profuse sweating</b>

Ok maybe “no Russian” can take a LITTLE accountability😂😂😂

bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
PewDiePie Voices Over a Pyrocynical Video

It feels like im watching a different YouTuber like dj cook

Why does it feel so right that Felixs favorite actor is Joaquin Phoenix

If you listen very closely you canhear Pewds wearing his glasses.

i don’t think this was pewdiepie, this was felix Kjellberg

We live in a pewdiepieity

First comment in 2020 3q

Man I Can literally smell the glasses

When Pewdiepie&#39;s D-brand ad comes at the start of the video you think it is the actual video

The frick is white rage?!

best joker movie all time

I like this pewdiepie

I love it when Felix makes these kind of videos it fits his him. Not the meme side his serious side

I think that is one of my favorite videos ever

movie review
how many times did pewdiepie put the lol wordlollollollol

pewdiepie is getting smarter after he wore glasses
...hi

Pewds why dont you do more videos like this?? these were so good !!!

<a href="">2:07</a> good news because of joker he won in oscar and I’m so glad he did he really is a good actor.

we need more of these vids

my favourite movie

He&#39;s a film that u should be concerned, the new Netflix series &quot;Cuties&quot;.This series is straight up providing to Pedophiles.

As a spanish speaker it annoys me how everyone pronounces Joaquin

when did felix get soo wisdomy

For people that are on the edge already, films like this and violent games can be a   factor.

Sooo anyone here back after the new video

Here because pewds keeps recommending this

When I clicked on this video I didn&#39;t expect it to be from pewdiepie

Who came here from the latest video uploaded

More videos like this please

<a href="">4:17</a> , where was that scene in the movie, I don&#39;t actually see it?

This says a lot about our society😔

Say staunch again

How come the media was outraged over this and then there’s John Wick killing about 200 people each movie

Joker is the best film i had ever seen in my life 😘😘😘😘😘

pewds please do more videos like this one

Now i don’t even know how to pronounce Joaqiun anymore. Thanks Felix.

As someone with similar mental illness issues that was in this film, I loved this film, will I kill anybody? No, of course not. It shows mental health and how if not treated will lead too big problems. Bruh

Ironic how the media claimed the Joker film would cause upfighting and anarchy in the U.S by crazed &quot;right wingers&quot; and now we see with BLM that it is the left AND the media supporting anarchy...

I would have loved for him to win an Oscar for “Gladiator” and one of my favorite movies of all time “The Master”, his performance in “The Master” is fucking flawless, it physically hurts me that he didn&#39;t win an Oscar for that movie, I mean Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln is amazing, and he&#39;s probably my favorite actor of all time, but Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s performance in “The Master” is of the best displays of acting I&#39;ve ever seen, and it probably ranks among the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis himself, in “My Left Foot” and “There Will Be Blood”.  Joaquin Phoenix has been consistently snubbed for a long time and I&#39;m really glad that he finally won an Oscar for “Joker”.

<a href="">4:13</a> this is the real joker right here :)

This video legit proves how mature he is

Joaquin will always be the emperor

We live in a society

Is it me not good at English enough, or I have no idea what this guy is talking about?

he is just so obviously smart and intelligent and i really enjoy watching his videos where he speaks his opinions

Pewds just started understanding what Dr. Phil does for bratty teens

It kills me because this movie in my honest opinion doesn&#39;t actually say anything worthwhile. It says &quot;The system is bad&quot; without exploring what makes it bad, and it blames a lot of abstract concepts (e.g. &quot;the rich) without addressing real issues caused by said concepts.

When u realize pewdiepie is better at explaining politics than ur theory teacher

In India Joker released on 2 October , a day of non- violence

Don&#39;t ever accept media BS.
Bruh I literally got a ad after with Pewds in it wtf

Joaquin (Joaquín)is a spanish name it’s just that his family moved to America and probably didn’t care about their origin/history and now people think Joaquin is some weird name when it’s just the Spanish version of Joachim, a perfectly normal name.

How hypocritical these people are? The same people who criticize Trump for his statement about video games causes violence are the same who criticize The Joker for causing violence? Like what the fuck?Also why CNN is criticizing the movie? Isn&#39;t CNN and Warner Bros. are under the same company, TimeWarner? Seems like a no brainier.

Fake news be like: guy with dyed hair called himself joker

forgot this was pewdiepie for some min...

What happened to George Floyd caused violence and rightly so. Real world events are more powerful then movies.

From the futureWe have pandemic

The media worships power. They love brainwashing the people.

Doesn’t sound like him

I still can&#39;t believe my uncle was on TV and this video

I went through half of this video not realizing that Pewdiepie was talking. Then suddenly, I was like “hey this dude sounds a lot like Pewdiepie” and what do you know

s o c i e t y
But uh pewds we live in a society

Two essential educators of this generation - whom right away should be included in mandatory studies in classrooms of high schools: Jordan Peterson and Felix Kjellberg.

Deeabuout

The Media™ has finally got what they wanted to happen in America. Mass riots and protests.

Funny how this video makes more sense in 2020

I love how he says question
<b>Todd phillips kills comedies</b>
Pewdiepie .do you watch the internet&#39;s janitor?

It’s is happening now! America Probably end up civil war

If someone had told me that pewdiepie will become a voice of reason on youtube, i would have called him crazy.

Wow what a wholesome video

this video was on my birthday

Now he won one oscar

Joker is an EPIC FILM ❤️❤️❤️💝💖
<b>S O C I E T Y</b>
The thrasher hell bomb joker clip yesssss

i have so much respect for the man wearing the Alianza Lima jersey

the otherside of felix

but why did they make the joker an attention needy kind of weird though? like you see the joker in The past movies, like gosh can you imagine the Jack Nicholson joker being an attention needy crime villain?

i love how he&#39;s being deep and philosophical with surreal entertainment playing in the background

<a href="">2:16</a> He was in Brother Bear?!Damn. I never realised that.

Like with u thought the joker was sad?

Society

It is ironic how the media says that games, movies, music promotes hatred and consequentially violence, yet the media, in the same breath, tells you who to hate (e.g. Mexicans, Jews etc.)

I like the voice over videos so much more... Blame!, Diogenes, joker, etc.

I think it&#39;s laughable news media tries to blame other things for societal violence, they should have a serious serious look in the mirror.

I loved this video, i would love to see more analytical videos

You should do a face reveal.

Love seeing these video&#39;s,  really demonstrate&#39;s how intelligent and cool of a person Felix is.

Man pyrocynical  has dropped in quality

The media is shit, they&#39;re useless now

quackin

I love how the media said people would go on a shooting spree or something like that and everyone just started dancing down stairs

<a href="">4:25</a> my mom talks about that all the time. Her and my little brother were supposed to go and watch it in that exact room but left her purse at home so they didn’t even step foot in the theater

It&#39;s the power of suggestion.. you put that idea or role in peoples heads they&#39;ll fill that role and that idea will most definitely come true. The things you try to avoid the most till come back go get you in the end. This movie was great and I have watched it multiple times it&#39;s fantastic and Joaquin Phoenix is the most amazing actor ever and I wish hed get recognition forthat. ☺I&#39;m so happy pewds likes him too. Although I think he should get more attention than he does maybe he likes where hes at. But I hope Joaquin knows he has people that truly admire his work. 🤘he was the best joker by far besides heath ledger RIP🤘

<a href="">3:58</a>-<a href="">4:00</a> That was EPIC!!! Wish I was there dame it! 😭

<a href="">2:23</a> Felix do it
phoenix did a phenomenal job...

I watch joker it was  a meme rated r

Felix, I really would like that video on Joaquin now 🙂

Joaquin Phoenix’s should now be pronounced as “Joking Phoenix”

jared leto now: cult

This film isn&#39;t a glorification of mental illness or violence. It&#39;s a cautionary movie begging us to be  careful on how we treat people.

damn i love when pewds does videos like this

i want more videos like this from pew

The joker has fallen into society in gotham city

I have been to the golden temple when it was rebuilt

Trump: it&#39;s all fake news

Pewdiepie is based and redpilled

The media really wanted a shooting at a joker screening they were practically begging for it. Meanwhile Machete attack at frozen 2 and it barley gets covered

How about another joke pewdsy

I already watched the movie of the joker and I was speechless as if you too

How do you get people to do something?By telling them not to do so.

I like how the media kept saying that someone would copy the Joker and how the movie was dangerous yet any time there’s an active shooting the face of the shooter is posted all over the internet like a star

HE DID WIN ONE! BEST LEAD ACTOR! :DDD heck yea mah boii

This is pewds real big brain time

Why so serious pewds?

I like Joaquin Phoenix  as a  Jonny  cash and  not  as  a joker

Please don&#39;t  it&#39;s  too much violence and  too  scary  to  watch  and   joker  seriously  he a  murder   and  and  all  ways  laugh  at  every thing  don&#39;t  like it

I know this late but it’s pronounced hwakeen because he’s Hispanic 😂 joe-ohcan sounds cooler tho

Joker made $1 billion dollars the highest grossing R-rated film/highest grossing R-rated comic book-superhero movie of all time and won 2 oscars for Best Actor (Joaquin Phoenix) and Best Original Score (Hildur Guodottir) as well as a Golden Lion. Ironic how the media treated it.

I have no respect for people who rely on occam&#39;s razor to make decisions.

I don’t get it.....
<a href="">2:05</a> thankfully, this is outdated

Self fulfilling Prophecy

BIG BRAIN VIDEO!!!

Lol why can&#39;t Felix pronounce Joaquin&#39;s name? I get it, he&#39;s got an accent but it&#39;s pretty easy once you&#39;ve heard the correct way.

his name is pronounced the way it is pronounced because he is from Puerto Rico

<a href="">2:07</a> He actually won an oscar

he had every right to joaq out of that interview

I&#39;m proud but at the same time ashamed  that Joker vs society memes started in Brazil

gay

PewDiePie....Its Very Very Lucky Channel In The World....👍👍👍

Frozen 2 caused more violence then Joker. Your move, media.

<a href="">6:05</a> haters gonna hate joker gonna skate
I thought this was sun random channel that makes theories abt films until i looked at the channel name

I loves these videos that talks about movies/ other forms of art and also give multiple view points

I call him Joaquin when I didn&#39;t know it was pronounced hwokin

Still waiting for that Joaquin phoenix video. (please make!)

Wait this was pewdiepie he sounds different since the last time I watched.

Ngl I&#39;m so happy someone realises joaquin talent, he deserves the best

Joaquin Phoenix is ​​such a lovely person and on top of that a brilliant actor.  He really deserved the Oscar for his incredible performance as Joker. ❤️

there are two types of joker fans:- chill people who dance on stairs and make joker memes- horny edgy touch starved greasy incels who are convinced they have borderline personality disorder and restless leg syndrome

Media: JoKEr iS gONnA EnCouRaGE ViOlEncEReality: <b>kids make memes about dancing on stairs</b>

I bought this movie today.  To really understand the trailers, you really should watch the movie in its entirety.   Arthur is a sad figure.  I can understand where he is coming from,  Joaquin surely had to reach deep inside himself to project Arthur.  Everything about this movie says &quot;Oscar&quot;.   Joaquin&#39;s win is truly deserved.  I am a Joaquin fan forever.

Awww 23 Nov !!! I just realized that you uploaded this video in my Birthday that’s so awesome 😭🎊

Lol didn’t even realise this was pewdiepie until the end 😂

<b>S O C I E T Y</b>
And people think that Felix can&#39;t be serious...

Thanks for your voice, Pewds!
A lot of wokeness seems to be an establishment reinforcement chess piece these days. And it&#39;s creepy as fuck.

Most inspiring sound ever

The film shows how violence can be made

Media these days r like a double edged swordThey help ppl know good things and also they make ppl believe stupid controversies and fake things Media should be more responsible of their actions Just coz they have the freedom doesn&#39;t mean they can abuse and rewrite what&#39;s the truth..

I LOVE this type of Pewds Videos

<b>**pewdiepie goes to vacation**</b>9&#39;s year old army: Time travel.

Suck it marvel. Pewdiepie made an entire video from start to finish about defending joker. And made an entire video of hating marvel while using the dark knight as the argument why DC is better

Joker  🥰🥰🥰
I don&#39;t understand the &quot;he&#39;s wearing his glasses&quot; meme

Media: &quot;This movie will cause violence!&quot;<b>Joker released; no violent acts reported</b>Media: &quot;Wait....that&#39;s illegal!&quot;

Joker is the  victimSociety is the criminal

wait is this a video essay?

I didn’t even realize this was a pewds video and I was just thinking hey, this sounds like Pewdiepie. Ugh

Who’s here after Joaquin just won best actor

He finally won an Oscar 🥺

Don&#39;t worryMidia&#39;s just joking

Society

I think Phoenix fit this role better than any other role, because he almost deals with real life mental illness and Todd Philips and his films do.

That&#39;s a well written video essay.

Hope Felix would make a commentary channel

Do they not realize that this movie is about people who are messed up in the head and that they made this a movie to call out those who are struggling

Weight is just going to end like that?

Now if you ever get bullied at school turn to them and say &quot;Wanna hear another joke?&quot;They&#39;ll get the hint.

Media: &quot;ThIs mOviE wiLL caUsE MaSS SHootiNgs&quot;Joker movie releases: Nothing happens<b>Media disliked that</b>

Anyone who says Joker is bringing out the worst on the internet has clearly never been on reddit

Pls make more voice over video

since when did Pewds become a commentray channel?

<b>m a l e   r a g e   a n d    w h i t e   r a g e</b>
&quot;I don&#39;t believe you&#39;ve ever cried in your life&quot; jesus fuck I love that guy hahahahahaha

The fact that the media attacked this just because the movie attacked the media and society says a lot. But I love to think that Joaquin knew this and he decided to walk out just to upset the media more.

Damn there’s an episode on radio tts where a woman gives her account of being in the aurora shooting. She was sitting next to a young girl. Her husband was shot. Said something about the shooter being a monster can’t remember if she said joker

Any chance the fear mongering over the movie was just a marketing ploy?

Bru, the video would be better if at the end he said, &quot;and that&#39;s life, as funny as it may seem.&quot;

Thanks for reviewing it a year later

For my points of view,I think the movie itself isn&#39;t that stunning,for me it’s a little bit bored,there’s not really a clear turning point. But Joaquin Phoenix’ve done an absolutely fascinating job.

Joacim is Spanish.

&#39;I Dont believe you&#39;ve ever cried in your life&#39; haha he&#39;s so real I love it

I just saw Hustlers.  Now I want to be a whore :\

This was in my home page, i was exited, then realized he was still on vacations. Hope he is resting well

<a href="">5:43</a> if you know you know

Does he have more videos in this style? And if he does, what&#39;s their names?

So the all movies called the Purge is ok?And not a movie about a comic book character that has a mental illness?Ok.

Never hit that like button so hard in my life. Got totally stoked by you mentioning Joaquin.

ahhh...yes, you&#39;ve stumbled on an interesting answer: the media was putting out the idea of a movie theater shooting so heavily in the hopes that a shooting would be encouraged.  This is about gun politics.

thank you for the podcast

PewDiePie like this makes me edge

Never liked Jared Leto, such a tryhard

&quot;My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face. She told me I had a purpose: to bring laughter and joy to the world&quot;<b>Yo that scene made me cry 😭😭😭 he just wanted to make people happy</b>

So many more violent movies come out every semester yet I don&#39;t see the media cowardly attacking them as they did with Joker lol I wonder why????Joker showed people how awful media can be and the media doesn&#39;t like that, surprise surprise!

I’m looking for a lost meme

The Joker did nothing wrong

“Bombing”

<b>D😊N&#39;T</b>
We seriously need to either have Political leaders who can identify that any problem is always more complex than it seems...Or for us humans as a whole to get rid of the political system.(It&#39;s more better to have a society that&#39;s more blunt &amp; honest with their words, than one thats too polite to really say on what they truely feel inside.)Case in point: people nowadays are Fakers to themselves &amp; those around them

Big Serious Time
Can we do more voice overs i think its just more chill

&quot;WHAking&quot;

quackin

I’m the Joker baby

Joacim is not an English name.

“I don’t believe you’ve ever cried in your life”DAYUM

The message of the film is to be kind to everyone and try see yourself in someone else&#39;s shoes.

damn, Pewdiepie does video essays now??
Here’s the thingThe movie doesn’t cause violence It shows how violence is caused.

yes

I got pulled over from security during the joker movie my hair was dyed blue and faded to green and they thought from the security room I had make up which I didnt and he grabbed me by my  shoulder and said the reason why I told him about my hair he wouldnt stop saying sorry cause he said due to thought I was going to do something bad or acting out joker to much

I have a joke. What do you get when you cross a society who is sick of all the lies and bs with a media who wants violence and tragedy? They get what they f&#39;ing deserve!(que stair dance)

So on point.

What dos Bloria Borber think about this tho?

10/10 would watch more videos like this from felix

Why does Jared get an Oscar but not Joaquin

I clicked this cuz I thought it would be a meme review

<a href="">1:59</a> this literally sounded like Jared Leto

i dont believe you&#39;ve ever cried in your life.

The Joker held a mirror to the medias role in creating the very monsters we fear. That&#39;s why the media hated it so much. The last thing they want to be told is they hold some responsibility for many of the shootings.

It took me 4 minutes to realize this was a serious video

I’m late to this but I hate the whole let’s baby proof the world because movies games etc people that are dangerous are always going to be dangerous not because of a movie..

Social media and media reporting on shit they have never seen or done research on needs to be culled.

Media: &quot;Joker will cause violence and should be stopped at once!&quot;People Who Saw It: &quot;Well, now since the media is telling me to not do it, I am gonna do it.&quot;(Social Media seriously encourages people to do it rather then not to do it so they can have a story to talk about.)

My brother is in the marines right now still I’m 12 years old and nothing happen he warned me so I went for it in theaters by October 14 my friend invited me to watch this movie since I watch it on October 4 and we saw a gun luckily we got out alive

Love this video, enjoy the perspective and analysis of the movie

I went to see joker 3 times to help the cause

<a href="">3:58</a> Please can I have some info as to WTF? XD

Media:The joker is the most psychologically disturbing movieThe Godfather:Bitch please!

When you are not facing the camera, your opinion comes across very well. I did not expect a well thought out opinion from you. Great job.

Honestly I think this is your best video. Excellent job Felix!

That japanese temple analogy was actually brilliant

&quot;Don&#39;t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good&quot;Romans <a href="">12:21</a>

Whose here after the golden globes?

HOW ABOUT ANOTHER JOKE..PEWPEWWWW.....
&quot;Joaquin&quot; is a typical Latin name, thus not pronounced as it would be were it a typical &quot;American&quot; given name....

red dyed hair everyone in media is colour blinded

Was that the bite of 87!?

<b>watch mojo intro plays</b>
“ I don’t believe you’ve ever cried in your life” 😂😂😂 I love him

<b>get a load of this society</b>

Choaken Phoenix? Lol I thought you say JOAquin Phoenix

This was honestly one of my favorite videos from you. Well done.

100 mil subs!
Bleugh...

Holy shit Joaquin Pheonix just won a Golden Globe award

There is a Arthur inside all of us.

id love it if you did more videos like this one

SOCIETY

Jokers my favorite movie!!

Onision is the new joker.

Very honest and a smart thought through take on a controversial topic. Well done pewds!

It’s not R in Australia

I realised this was pewdiepie 4 minutes in

Who else wants Felix to do more Hollywood based videos

This was informativeNot the normal pewdiepie video

All I can say is freedom of speech

<a href="">1:11</a> &quot;jellyfishing&quot;

<a href="">8:24</a> <b>turn on caption</b> kwok-him lmao

“Whatever happened to crazy?”-Chris Rock

The pronunciation would be spainish

Felix pronounced “Quackin”

I watched this twice :) people should really listen to you

Brilliant video 👏🏽👏🏽
Pewdiepie=big brain
Pewds : I want you to get this man&#39;s name right , kay ?Also Pewds : This is my friend Quack-een Phoenix

Love these types of vids

Joakimkardashin
Not even gonna mention the influence of Taxi driver?

Ahh yes Joker... or as I like to call it Taxi driver/King if comedy.

Joaquin is not pronounced as you wish, because he was born in Puerto Rico, so Joaquin is Spanish, not English.

The next step is to realize that the media stations KNOW that publicizing a potential disaster can make it more likely to happen. Do you really think they dont know that? Theyll always deny it, but the disasters that come from these scenarios drive up news viewership. The disaster happening brings attention to the news, and allows them to say &quot;I told you so&quot;. If theres no disasters, you might not want to watch the news anymore, and we cant have that, can we?

I just love these videos...

Please please make video about Joaquin Phoenix!! I like him too🤗

A Brazilian
This is Pewdiepie&#39;s big brain time

I think hate feeds of love

The movie really left me thinking about people in big cities, i hope things aren&#39;t as bad as it&#39;s portrayed in the movie

Awesome movie!

That animation thing of the joker is scarier than the actual joker

Joaquin is a Spanish name

WAIT. THATS THE GUY FROM GLADIATOR??? THE BAD GUY? how did I not know that

records with Felipe Neto please

I am from Brazil I am very much your fan loved the video

Very mature explanation as to why people blame others and not themselves, I would have gone with &quot;because Americans are narcissists and fucking stupid&quot;

i love videos like this professor felix is amazing

You are thinking wrong about this. The press and the media pushed the narrative about an upcoming shooting during the Joker screen, because they WANTED it to happen. They are desperate for shootings, they are also desperate to attack men and blame the NRA, blame the Republican party, blame Trump, blame the non existing &quot;patriarchy&quot;, etc. I bet they are really sad that no violence happened.  They wanted it so bad.

Hello pudi
Pewdiepie: My me mine favorite actor (cant even pronounce his name)

Kvu j

I&#39;m pretty sure PewdiePie got that Japan references from reading Mishima&#39;s &quot;The Temple of the Golden Pavilion&quot; which actually includes a fictional interpretation of that arson event.

lol pewd the best

The funny is, &quot;people&quot; weren&#39;t concerned about the movie, its was the freaking media who if they had done their job would know the truth about Aurora. But that wouldn&#39;t fit the narrative now would it??

Actually a very good video

I’m gassed he mentions drill music♥️

4 million views!

Going back to what you said about the burning Temple that reminds me of the Frozen 2 machete brawl

reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Damn I love it when he levels with us this way. He really has a good head on his shoulders.

Not gonna lie, that Jared Leto vs Squidward laugh comparison made my entire day. Thank you.

This movie was great, it did not incite violence but instead shatter the mental health stigma. The media reacted hysterically to see their bullshit being confronted. Just look at the audience ratings vs critic ratings. Truly the best mental health movie of the decade.

Cleverly
Joaquín Phoenix is ​​a chingoneria, and the joker movie is the best of the decade. 👌❤
The Dark Knight Rises is my favorite movie despite what happened, plus I don&#39;t go to theaters to see movies. I watch at home so I don&#39;t have to watch things I shouldn&#39;t see. I can pause fast forward and turn off.

While I 100% agree with this, I sort of understand the articles&#39; concerns. I hadn&#39;t actually heard about all the warnings and concerns before the movie came out, but after I saw it in theaters, I definitely had the thought that this could easily inspire some edgelord to pull some shit while trying to act like the joker. It&#39;s really just a fear at this point and knowing how possible it is, at least in America where we have a shooting every other day. Also I graduated high school four years ago and a couple of the people I graduated with definitely fit the bill of a joker wannabe (one of them even got suspended after making a &quot;kill list&quot;.) While I think it was stupid of the articles to place such heavy warnings on a movie they hadn&#39;t even seen, I can understand after seeing the movie that those fears aren&#39;t completely misplaced. Good movie though. Glad we all just dancin on the stairs ya know?

I love how he sad debut it sounds like debit like a direct debit 😂

Please do a video on Joaquin. He’s so interesting.

Pewds has been watching WatchMojo

That was a great video, i wish it had more views, so you put out content like this more often

Pewds: an actual intellectual.  Periodt.

I love voice over videos
pwediepie is shit 😑
If Joaquin Phoenix Doesn&#39;t Win An Oscar With This Performance, We Will Go Out On The Street As A Clown.

joker: lets kill someone in the trainpolice: I have never seen clown killed people, but I have seen clowns make funjoker: ALL CLOWNS KILL PEOPLE!!!!!!arrest this clown they killed people they not make fun of people but this clown are dumb!

He was a gamer then a dramaalert then a meme reviewer then a Minecraft Youtuber now he&#39;s reviewing movies holyshit PewDiePie is basically become God YouTube God who am I kidding you always been YouTube God

“Why isn’t his name called Joacim Phoenix, English language... please”Um because his name is a Spanish language and him being Puerto Rican has something to do with the spelling of his name? But that’s just my guess.

Voice over video?? But where is CoD gameplay????

pewds, Joaquin is pronounced wah-keen

Pheoix delivered beautifully. Dope script and dope movie. Id love to see him adjacent a good batman

This was a good video, do more of these

He most definitely was wearing his glasses when record thisI promise I’ll hit the like button!!!!YOU PROMISED!!!

It&#39;s funny that this video has so many of felix&#39;s pet pievs from his YouTube is stinky video lmao

Profound and eloquent statement

I loved the movie so much tbh

Obviously he was wearing his glasses

I actually couldn&#39;t have written my essay for uni without this video lol. Thanks for giving me so many references and so much information!

It&#39;s a little unfair to blame the pronunciation of a Spanish name on the English language.  Anyway, would you prefer he went back to being called Leaf?

I like this kind of videos.

i fucking love this type of content please do more

Damn these movies review videos are just awesome! You really should turn it into a series Pewds! Movies with Pewds!

Very well said.

I think we need more videos like this. Interesting, smart, fresh... makes me wanna wear some glasses myself

Cue greedy sung by ariana grande

I agree. I saw some of the news reports and even before things came out about them admitting that they didn&#39;t watch it, I had my doubts. I was like &quot;Wait a minute are you sure that&#39;s the case? I have heard nothing but positive reviews. In fact more recommendations to see it than anything&quot; so now to hear that some didn&#39;t watch it makes me feel like I was right to doubt it from the beginning

on base of the US military issue a warning, I&#39;m station in VA D.C never got a warning or anything of the like

can everybody stop saying that he was wearing his glasses while recording this?

Personally my favorite joker was Heath Ledger but Joaquin Pheonix is probably my second favorite

Tbh &quot;Joacim&quot; is better than tryhards that call him &quot;Wahkeen&quot;

Do you know we live in a society.

Great vid, I hope you make more essay-style videos like this in the future, learned a lot!

Get Fenix to host meme review

I forgot this was pewdiepie man

Pewds should be listened to dis was an amazing video

Joaquin was Kenai in Brother Bear?! Wtf

Felix: What wrong with englishMe: Joaquin is a name in spanish

it’s pronounced whoa-keen :)❤️

Like for &quot;TeamTrees&quot;!

Pewds isn&#39;t just funny, he&#39;s also smart and well-spoken.

Joker

I never knew he was in brother bear?????

I need this edited laugh with squidward fr

Pewds isn&#39;t just funny, he&#39;s also smart and well-spoken.

Pewds isn&#39;t just funny, he&#39;s also smart and well-spoken.

Ok pyro

Yes.

Really good..hope you do more vids like this

I like this movie

On our school spirit day a freshman at my school dressed up as the Joker with face paint and everything and danced on one of the stairways. It was one of the greatest things I&#39;ve seen in my life.

I&#39;m baffled Joaquin didn&#39;t win an Oscar for Walk the line or Gladiators. He&#39;s def an unusual guy. So insanely talented.

<a href="">1:59</a> D R E W   R U S S E L L 😃

Wow a commentary????

this is my favourite source of news

they need more people like Felix in Buzzfeed

holy fuck this shits good 100%

STAHP HATE!

I LOVE these well thought out and executed opinion pieces.  Gives us insite into Pewds the person.

very smart felix
Subscribe to society

Joaquin has never won an Oscar?! I&#39;m sueing hes talented and attractive and I&#39;m sueing

Dude, in my country there is serious shit going on, we are in a socio political crisis, with marchs and strikes. Anyways, this happened like 2 weeks after Joker´s premiere, and I think maybe it influenced a tiny bit. I mean, search some pictures &quot;Chile Joker&quot; or something like that. Last thing, it is a great movie .

Kinda happy that pewdiepie said Colorado but not in the way of the shooting

Loved this video.

Give us more of this type of content please, if you can that is

Why Felix doesn’t get more views on these masterpieces is a mystery to me...

The media do this all the time. I’m glad Felix pointed this out. (I just finished a paper&amp; presentation on this, let me know if you want the link)

I&#39;d put this along with mass shootings. Everyone always blames access to firearms and the NRA while the media just showers these events for weeks to come, posting their pictures, manifestos, and everything they can about the scumbags.

I don&#39;t care I can&#39;t believe I listened to this with my own two ears

Pewds ur awesome at this! Do more of these plzzzzz!

Lol funny Pewds funny video I liked this video yes!!!!👍😅

You&#39;re looking too hard into it, hate is just a natural response like love and that&#39;s it, it can be misguided and wrongly placed or be the very thing that motivate you to stay alive.Thing is, the media love to try and make people feel it toward things and people that goes against their political ideologies or for whatever else reason these vermins see fit.

The number of subscribers to the channel is crazy lol
OK, why is pewds so different in this video???

He sounds like a reporter! And he&#39;s smart, open-minded, and explain things clear..

Joker sucker top
I'm the only Indonesian here!
I would really like more vids like this that are more serious than usual.

I&#39;ve sometimes had that Squidward laugh in my head ever since i was a child

<a href="">5:38</a> i like the guy dancing from far back

I&#39;m probably never going to sub to this ch. but I gotta say that I see why PewDiePie has so many followers. Respect

Love this video! One of your greatest! Thank you for showing your bros an even deeper and more awesome side to you!

what he says is beautiful ^^
Please do more voice-overs or just generally videos of you talking about a subject (contemporary or otherwise). I love these kinds of videos from you considerably more than the others (I also love Pew News and miss your Book Reviews).

Good job Pewds ! Ur a good guy !💪🏻
This format is amazing

more videos like this please

I love that the biggest YouTuber is a smart, good man, who is a good influence

Make more videos like this. This was excellent.

There’s this thing called “Joker Effect” a week after the movie came out many countries started social raids, started to complain about social inequality, injustice, etc. Like Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, Honduras and many others, it’s kinda amazing how the anger against the state and government started to emerge after this film

Art may “inspire” people to do awful things but the art or artist themselves have nothing to do with other people’s actions. I’m sick of people placing blame on anything BUT themselves.

My mum believes everything her friend says so she tried to ban me from dc.. she didnt succeed

I love this pew

don&#39;t forget to smile!JOKER.

Thought i was watching one of those pursuit of wonder video

Why do we need to always interview, just watch the movie why do u need the man to speak. The same with football just watch the frokin game and if u got question theres plenty of analysts out there. I mean if at least they made good questions but they dont so just stfu media thanks

This video was very comprehensive and insightful. I love videos like then. 10/10 would watch again

That video was on point!

That’s funny because I’m in the military and the movie came out to our military theaters even before the movie was done being showed at civilian theaters....

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

He’s also my favorite actor :(

Maaannn i tought this was a funny vídeo :(

They are angry But in 50 shades of grey remind me who didn&#39;t liked it?How many children went to see it?See my pointAny way Felix is really true

I wouldn&#39;t have seen Joker in the theatre if it hadn&#39;t gotten so much bad press.  Thanks Woke Media for convincing me to watch it ASAP

Amazing Analysis.
I don&#39;t normally comment, but I really appreciate Felix not mentioning the name of the shooter. I wish other sources would do the same.

I enjoyed the film, though I wouldn&#39;t  call it my favourite of the year.In terms of style, it was excellent, they put a huge amount of work and it really paid off. But it felt like it was conceived and executed as a film with a substantial message, on that front it felt kind of... empty? to me at least. Friends I talked to who enjoyed the film more than I did didn&#39;t really have any arguments against that, I guess the whole thing was more viscerally enjoyable to them anyway.Like, I guess that the point you raise at the end (the media circus serves an organic part in creating these monsters) could be an element of the films message if it had a cogent one, but it feels like the film went more along the parable route, and any message directly applicable to the real world was lost along the way. Because for my money the portrayal of mental health, while I don&#39;t think the word &quot;dangerous&quot; can be reasonably applied to it, felt pretty meh to me on the realism front. Some bits of it worked, some bits didn&#39;t, ultimately it doesn&#39;t feel like a portrayal of mental health worth taking any real lessons from because it doesn&#39;t feel genuinely realistic. I came out of the cinema laughing my arse off because all I could think of at the end was: the film&#39;s message was basically &quot;we live in a society&quot;... That dumb petition got what it wanted without needing to exist, because that phrase&#39;s  meaningfully empty truism ended up being all the film seemed to be saying.I don&#39;t think this really diminishes the quality of the film in itself but I find the irony truly delightful.

Frozen 2 has lead to more real life violence than the Joker ever did

I think that this film would have had more impact and could have done even better without any ties to Batman.

Ya he was in my favorite movie “Walk The Line” he very much deserves a Oscar.

Hey Felix, I really liked this type of more serious video. If you like making them I&#39;d really like to see more in the future :)

This guy actually spoke for a couple minutes without laughing like a drunkard.

The movie was not &quot;woke&quot; enough. If something doesn&#39;t support their pc agenda they somehow go crazy

when you running out of ideas

The more videos that come out from pewdiepie, the more literate he shows himself to be. This is why we need book review back! (Please do it on light novels though, like the monogatari series).

still be the best content creator in the world, Greetings, I&#39;m from Indonesia :)

Okay but can you PLEASE do your video JUST on Joaquin. Thanks

I really loved it.

&quot;outcasts a lot of times want attention, they want to be heard even if it&#39;s a dying breath... just don&#39;t give it to them.&quot; just about the wrongest conclusion you could possibly come to.

Great episode, I love when you go deep in to things. Miss PewNews PepeHands

Pewds, where&#39;s the punchline?

I loved this movie. It was a fantastic and fresh new take on one of the most iconic villains that ever existed. And Phoenix was genuinely unsettling for all the right reasons. I would love to see an interaction between his Joker and a Batman.

Video: <b>ends</b>Me: ...*deep inhale*... I...aM SOO GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS GRACIOUS MAN AS THE KING OF YOUTUBE! HAllE-FREAKIN-LUJAH!!!

I have no idea why you have 102M subscribers..doing shits like this?!!!😑

This sounded like my middle school essay

I literally wasn’t paying and didn’t know I was watching peeeeeeewdipie

Joker: inspired people to visit a staircasefrozen 2: teenagers with machetes brawling

We live in a society except for me I live in a basement

Guys I love Pewdiepie this was a nice video

I LOVE. THAT. THRASHER. HELLBOMB. WAS THEREE

Apparently there&#39;s going to be a sequel..

Felix is such a good intellectual speaker

Felix, dont listen to the media, seriously, their twisted opinions are made simply because they dont know shit (i.e they fail, intentionally or not, to document themselves), and with the spread of the internet, its way easier to manipulate people and so on. If anything, they are the real clowns these days.Its simple. They dont care about the quality of their content, they simply care about the money they gain. And also political support. Although its noteworthy that there are some good, actually-researching journalists out there, but they simply become pushed aside for not complying with orders. Sad that reality has come to this...

Who woulda thought, the root of most problems is usually the media itself 😱

Who is Jared Leto?*edit One of my friends thinks he is cool 🤮

Damn i love it when you do these kind of videos

Based.

Bro his name is written correctly .....dudes puertorican

All very good and valid points.

The true irony is that media is making itself look bad specifically to the newer generation.. to send the message of revival.

Before the movie came out, agenda setting media set out to implant the thought that the movie would glorify violence and that Joker would kill a lot of people.Then the movie comes out, and it&#39;s about classisim, the importance of mental health, and how many times we, as society (no pun intended) cast aside people without measuring how we can affect their lives, and what they can potentially become. If anything, the movie doesn&#39;t celebrates the fact that Arthur becomes the Joker; it&#39;s a warning sign of why someone SHOULDN&#39;T become Joker, and what we can change about ourselves in the ways we treat people in order to avoid that.

are there spoilers in this

I really want more videos like this where he talks to a camera about his thoughts.  I really enjoyed this.

Genius pewds strikes again
this guy speaks so deep
Is he going to switch from Minecraft to video essays next? Tbh I would be totally down with that.

yo pewds this is a great video, keep it up. proud of u

when you have more editing in one video without your face than all the rest with

Felix is way too good at these type of videos to not do more.

We need more videos like this.

Glasses Felix makes an appearance

bet pewdiepie won&#39;t like my comment and shout out my channel.

damn felix, this video really had watchmojo vibes

People don&#39;t realize how much the media is trying to put messages on you. To make you believe in a certain way. Hopefully, the people who are susceptible to this, realize that the media is mostly not helpful and actually harms people into thinking in a certain way.

Please keep on making these kind of videos. I found this one super interesting, amusing and it made me think a lot. I am probably way to late that u will read this, but who knows... :)

dude dressed as the joker skating in that thrasher video was killing it. he took some hard slams too but absolutely destroyed everyone else.

<b>RESPONSIBILITY</b>

Super interesting video, I love when Felix gives his opinion on these sort of relevant &amp; contentious topics

aishtarku and qunati &#39;iina eiraqiin
You are So naive

Do more of these voice overs

Here in chile after we saw the movie ,we take it to another level

I can already see the titles:“Famous Youtuber Pewdiepie criticizes all news”“The mans back on his bullshit, says he is the best news reporter”

Pewds says Joaquins name like a frog would quack. You know, like Pepe. The frog.I&#39;m omegabrain

i love these kind of videos

I respect your viewpoint on this matter and I can see where you&#39;re coming from tbh although there are areas where I just disagree with you on this one pewds. Yes, the media had an overreaction as they do whenever it doesn&#39;t fit their &#39;status quo&#39; but the interviewer had a very reasonable question and Joaquin should have answered the question.  And thank you for saying the incident 7 years ago was a terrorist attack and not some mental health lone warrior bull crap the media love to spew.

I love when Felix makes serious videos. They are so insightful and he is so well-spoken. I love Felixes mind !

Is this lemmino&#39;s channel? 😂

All I got from this was iam the joker baby and I got sad because I remember cow chop then I got sad again because I remembered the creatures now iam sad thanks time to burn a gold temple down In China

Hearing pewdiepie like this, really makes me miss book review.

Pewdiepie doesn&#39;t know how to pronounce Joaquin

do more voice over videos, you are the god at both so do both more, obvious not all videos but more videos

Lmao my YouTube analytics say that 18% of my audience found me from this video

Media: &quot;Joker&quot; is dangerousMe: suck da bools

Wow you surprised me a lot with such an amazing analysis. I really love this video!

this video is basically a Socratic seminar

My teacher son was a n that movie he was the kid on the bus

Just recently a bunch of teens tried to do a machete brawl. The irony.........

It’s almost like the media wants bad 💩 to happen because if it does of course they are going to write about it and have weeks worth of content to talk about. Which by the way inspires other edgy sacks of tits to do these horrible things. I know it sounds weird but if everyone just pretended like these things didn’t happen maybe it would stop happening in the first place because like pewdiepie said “hate wants to be acknowledged” and of course the media isn’t going to stop and neither will their viewers which means neither will acts of hate.😐

Welcome to Pewds new segment...Learning with PewDiePie

Haha, America!

Movie review with felix

I love when he makes these videos

PIWDETSERIES

Wackin Phoenix

You are so fucking smart pewds abd you don’t get credited that enough

awesome video, and I didnt even finished it yet.grats

I sense a hidden message of violence in this video...........Kathy! Where is my gun!!!?

* 8 minute standing ovation *
The main stream media is one of the largest contributors to misinformation, indoctrination, and the subsequent division and hatred in our society. It&#39;s a poison, and we should tear it down utterly.

Marry Anti-Christmas!Hail Satan!

Unsatisfying number of views for a high quality video

He is called &quot;Hoakin&quot; instead of &quot;Yoakin&quot;because he is Puertorican

I love these types of videos, I hope for more in the future🙌🏻 so interesting.

WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
Media: Joker is going to couse violence. Joker: <b>Comes out</b> Media: WHY NO VIOLENCE?

I completely agree with this. Same thing goes for school shootings. I believe if they werent “glorified” by the public media then the number of mass shootings would not be  implanted into the brains of people. Phoneix walking out was one of the best ways to respond to the question, and thats “not to give it attention.”

i really love videos like this, please dont ever stop making them

Was waiting for you to make a vid about the joker, and how the media uses the power of suggestion to influence people. This was a perfect example. It&#39;s like they wanted people to act violent on the premiere week.

Send in the clowns

Heath&#39;s Joker was just like this... but it got so much appreciation. Why? Dont get me wrong, I love that version

Shit that deeeep

Ah yes, Philosopher Felix.

<a href="">2:20</a>I like this man already

The Joker will somehow inspire mass shootings...Yet intense action flicks like John Wick, with grotesque violence, isn’t even recognised by the media.

Well spoken Felix 👏🏻👏🏻 ❤️
Pewds on the facts

My 13 year old ass saw that

he looks like the lets play guy

but hay that just a theory

To anyone wondering there are no spoilers in this :)

Did Felix edit this vid?

I love these vids

Ayy im a whole month late too lmfao

I liked this video essay should do more like this

ABC Amy Robach.Lying about the jokerABC:yesTelling the truth about the clintonsABC:you are fired

The media is fakenews so screw them. They are specialized in bringing up bullshit and making a fuss about nothing while ignoring the really painful and heart pressing issues.

Pewds: english is weirdSwedish: krgeœfsnç
I’m the joker babie

Yeeeeeeeeeew

as a person who struggled with mental illness in the past, the movie was incredibly hard to watch and i considered walking out of the theater the whole time.the fact that the media automatically categorizes this film as a ‘dangerous message’ is insulting and quite frankly adds more stigma to mental illness.

Ok boomer

As much as I like Jared Leto, he has become weird. Even his music with 30 Seconds To Mars ain&#39;t as good as it used to be...

I want you up subscribers

i just love these kind of videos

Stfu pewds

Is it weird that I like the serious pewds videos more than the comedic ones lol (not all the time but a lot of the time) also I need to watch that joker animation 😂😂

Dude you&#39;re smart. This is almost like a dissertation

I lob u pewds
Pewds, make more of these videos. They’re so enjoyable and like you actually learn meaningful things 🙏🏼

More of these plz

The media didn&#39;t like Joker simply because they&#39;re a puppet to the upper class and Joker was all about class warfare.

More Voice overs

im the joker baby

Lmao Frozen 2 is all they said abt JOKER Movie theaters atmosphere!

Ngl I didn’t think this was a PewDiePie vid

I&#39;m pretty happy he never said he was the joker, the people I know who dressed up as the joker were just friendly cringelords.

<a href="">5:55</a>

I am the UttiPris I wish I would check my dream and the next to the joint JPs have been shared in the channel ❣🥺

does he use the old fifa font or what

Love this kinda video Felix, also not seeing you talk really helps concentrate on what you are saying

Pewds is example that Matured people love DC, hates marvel.Ps: Watch Pewds video against marvel

Hello, world!
I told my dad about this and he laughed. Joker movies has always had city violence every year and this year news media hates it.

I love these kind of videos from Pewds. Great video essay!

Pewdiepie sucks
Me through the whole video:  Wtf he&#39;s talking bout

I’am big fan of Joaquin Phoenix and you so hearing your opinion on him in a video would be great so you bloody make one now please! ( btw in the interview where he says “I don’t believe you ever cried in your life”,  the interviewer was a bitch and sarcastic so he kinda does the uno reverse card to her.

Also, I&#39;m pretty sure that event happened during the Dark knight Rises movie event, not the Dark Knight... these people will twist anything to get their way. Even straight facts.

This video is cool. Looks like Felix can be a good reporter or a member of VOX

It feels like I&#39;m watching some one else

Media is so brainless, they are spread the negativity of anything which is famous!! Well we all enjoy the movie and wish for more from the Joker, we will enjoy and walk out from the cinema with happy face, even we have fun on sharing the favourite part of the movie with our friends, please guys, don’t ever read those stupid media things, at least not those negative media shits

I actually like this format. Pretty chill and factual~

This movie doesn&#39;t even have anything to do with male rage but you gotta stop ppl from becoming too rambunctious about social opression.

Plz make more videos like this.

traditional media would rather torch and destroy the systems of truth, understanding, logic, integrity than lose their power. traditional mainstream media is essentially the japanese arsonist, except they use clickbaiting tactics and panic as their tools of destruction.

H3H3 to host meme review!!!!!

Yes yes yes
His accent is really heavy in this vid

Joaquin. “ENGLISH”. Pewds it’s Spanish
I&#39;m from Aurora, I remember the day when the shooting happened, and I still go to the movie theater. I am disappointed to see the media using a imaginary character as a scapegoat for the shooters intent.

Well said!

If big youtubers like pewdiepie are talking about this movie . You know you should watchit

Is water wet?

Dam those last lines thought Respect

5Head

<a href="">2:15</a> that felt very much like something from Joker. How Joaquin just calls people out probably helped with the acting lol

felix is so smart.

People don&#39;t need movies to get ideas to kill people, evil is in the heart of humanity and has been happening from the beginning of time.

Joaquin Phoenix should be the Joker in Suicide Squad 2.

It&#39;s Colorado I didn&#39;t think so too

See that&#39;s simple

When the Frozen 2 premiere causes more IRL violence than Joker ever did.

Joker + Harley Quinn = Joaquin &gt;&gt;&gt; feel your mind blown yet?

So the media is like To Catch A Predator except they’re begging predators to actually take the spotlight

White skin&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;White makeup

you are never going to see this but i would like to see more well researched short docs like this

Who is from INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Now hold on a minute <a href="">0:48</a>, he was born in Puerto Rico. The name is originally from Spain, but pretty common in latin and central america. Why should it be Joacim? Respect the name as it is. Not everything has to be american god dammit.Ps: great video pewds

Bro his name is in spanish of course it doesnt make sense in english

i think its marvel work for all those article bout violence

İ love this style of videos. And unsurprisingly Felix killed it. Well done man👍

I was expecting another meme review. However I was not dissapointed

well put my man

I love the effort put into this video. Was expecting a joker meme review but got something even better. I hope we get to see more videos like this one in the future!

Underrated review.

Please do more analysis like this Felix. You’re good at it, and the world needs it

I like this style of video. Who else thinks Pewds should make more voice-overs?

I absolutely adore when Felix does these types of videos

great film

The Aurora movie theater shooter was actually going to go to the Denver International Airport instead (as was stated in his manifesto) but he said he decided not to because they had armed guards.

The shooting in Aurora is right down the street from my house. Hearing him talk about really brings back the reality of that situatuon

Name them pewd

I  L O V E these types of videos, Pewds. I hope you will do more!

This is such a great and well spoken video

Why did YMS steal Pewdiepie&#39;s channel?

I truly love these types of videos of pewds the most.

Subscribe: eternal life Like: a lot of money!
Pewdiepie joins Film Theory with MatPat 👏👏

<a href="">6:38</a>Bomb-Bing

<a href="">4:09</a>

more of these voice over videos please

Insightful Pewds is insightful.You&#39;re a beacon of trueness you don&#39;t find often in this feminist/pc ridden world.All hail a true genuine voice that doesn&#39;t cater to shitty shallow subjects or views to get back pats from crowds of sheep.

I came here for memes not lectures...

In the middle of this video,I totally forgot that I&#39;m watching PewDiePie&#39;s video.😅😍

Joaquim Phoenix ❤🏆❤🏆❤🏆❤🏆❤🏆❤🏆
This is awesome that you talked about this pewds it’s glad that someone we look up to is more sane than the not so sane news reporters

Really loved this type of video

I love these types of videos from Pewds.

Frozen 2&#39;s premiere was more violent than the media portrayed Joker to be

Great video, Felix. This isn’t like any of your other videos. It’s a real, serious video, and I like it. Thank you for this. Have a great day!

He&#39;s wearing his glasses again

Incels and the term itself was invented in 2015. Stop ostricizing people for menial things amd bad shit wont happen

I loved the movie honestly.

^_~

3 minutes into this i thought I’m watching a top 10 fact video

Roblox be likeROBLOX (owner) : alright let&#39;s check the statsHaCkeR: <b>hacks</b>ROBLOX (owner): ok...Pewdiepie: <b>plays Roblox</b>ROBLOX ( owner): I suddenly feel the urge to allow this hacker, and ban Pewdiepie because I feel like it

woah. this was a really good video.

Here in Greece the movie was marketed as pretty much Oscar bait.I arrived at the cinema of a ~35k ppl town and was 28th in line. This has never happened to me at that cinema no matter the day, date, or movie.Even more surprising was the demographic breakdown of the audience: people of every gender and agree group, including groups of women in their 50s and 60s. Somehow I couldn&#39;t picture them watching a comicbook movie.But then, Joker didn&#39;t feel like a comicbook movie. Too realistic. Personally, I didn&#39;t even like the comic connection. Call it &quot;The Clown&quot; or &quot;The Fool&quot; or even &quot;The Jester&quot;, set it in New York and cut out the Wayne bullshit.I hope a sequel never gets made, because this Joker couldn&#39;t lead a cat out of a wet paper bag, much less run a crime organization.

Pewdiepie: meme review channelYouTube news channelGaming channelPhotoshop tutorial channelVlog channelDr Phil review channelMovie review channelIs there any type of content that we can’t get here? 🤔

Joaquin is the Spanish version of Joacim, just so you know Felix :))

Big brain!
Is this dunkey???

Man I like this mini deep dive type video

disturbed - legion of monsters

 comes into my mind

a non american reporting on american media’s response to an american movie in america

I think the best part of this channel is that in one video, it’s a deep video, and in another, he worships a plant in a game.

The manufactured hype around gun control being kicked into overdrive  resulted in mass shootings tripling during the Obama presidency. Seeing the media begging and begging for a shooting to happen was disgusting. We mustn&#39;t let them project their own evil onto us.

Boi I though this was meme review lol

Where is petscop 2??

Pewds seriously should consider making documentations. With all the good editing, well-researched topic and an unbiased (at least through this video, I see him taking neutrality) view, I can see myself enjoying this a lot.

This is the problem with society .

friking loved the movie💕

We all know the media was biased towards MCU and wanted the Joker to fail bad, like really-really bad. Frozen II and Endgame has caused more violence than Joker ever did. But the media as usual wants to ignore it and take side.

I didint even realize this was a pewdiepie vídeo until almost the end! LOOL Not used to this serious content.

Felix: Makes a well-written well thought out think piece about Joker and how the media often encourages violent acts while pretending they are against them.Media: PEWDIEPIE DEFENDS JOKER!!!!!

can we talk about how it made 1 BILLION without china

Gotham city is that able to make dead people alive. ://

joker video and gaming voiceover?coincidence?

And the movie that causes violence, is Frozen 2.

<a href="">7:19</a> she’s the woman who tried to delete Fortnite

felix unironically has big brain

The Media: &quot;Joker will cause violence and should be stopped&quot;



The Movie: &quot;The media contributes to violence and should be observed to help prevent it from happening.&quot;

This was probably one of the best videos I&#39;ve seen from Felix this year alone. Really enjoyed it, very thought provoking

Does anyone else find it annoying that they made the movie so that the Joker had a mental illness, when the original character was just mad. It kinda defeats the purpose of it.

Me: * Sees a low poly joker *My Brain: S U R R E A L  E N T E R T A I N M E N T

So here&#39;s what happened the director of joker had a problem with sjw and so the movie had to die

American Media, Swedish media. Same shit slightly different surnames.

oof

Its not English.

I really loved the movie and the message it&#39;s trying to deliver, there where many times in my life where I felt miserable and wanted to just let all my anger out, all I wanted was to be treated like a human being and for people to stop being rude(I&#39;m in a good place now I&#39;m no longer in the dark past) and Arthur wanted to be treated nicely, to feel happy for once but he got pushed too much to the edge and lost it completely, that doesn&#39;t excuse his actions but if he at least got some help(and he tried to) he wouldn&#39;t have gone this far

It’s a joker movie, what did they expect?

This was such a good video

<a href="">2:52</a> Literally every single war movie works for recruitment..

I love these kind of controversial videos please do more

THANK YOU

Leto should have listened to Kirk Lazarus.Also, I like that the new Joker is the same guy who beat an alien to death with a baseball bat. That is very in-character.The idea of a Puerto Rican actor being accused of embodying &quot;white rage&quot; is funny to me. Stay classy, media goons. Stay classy.

&quot;Who do you think owns the media?&quot;

A comedian trying to be serious hahahaPewdiepie. Just stop it.I like you, but...just stop.

Jared: why wasn’t why the joker in this movieEveryone: Mabey if you were a better than terrible joker bitch

I actually love PewdsNo Homo. But he&#39;s such a good guy

I got clickbaited
The real-world joker is President Trump. If you don&#39;t become a joker, an American president can&#39;t stand the pressure. If you say something wrong, you might be assassinated. Even if you don&#39;t die, the people will die if a war or terrorism occurs. Otherwise, people from other countries will die. An unrelated person will die at all. Even if tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands die, they are not charged with sin. Such an American president is the joker itself. Ne, God.

Concern for something with joker but the bad thing happens later... frozen 2 machete, weird

Very good observation, and good message. You have good thought processes on these subjects. I enjoy hearing them

<a href="">0:50</a> because it&#39;s spanish name and follows spanish rules

best villain of all time = thanos ? no it&#39;s media .

How did &quot;the hype&quot; of the movie kinda ruin it for you felix? I&#39;m actually curious because I see this a lot. People tend to hate the most popular things for no reason. If the movie wasnt hyped would you have been more happier/excited to see it? Not picking on you, and obviously you wont reply, but I just had time on my hands and thought I&#39;d ask

Professor Felix dropping facts

I loved this format!!I want more!!Is wonderful to hear yo talking so deep and serious about things. I do really enjoy this kind of videos, for example the one of the books, man you are great. Thanks for not leaving YouTube. We love you pewd.

The media just needs to stop blaming people. It’s so annoying

I live in Colorado and had thought that the attack was based on joker. Thanks for clearing up. I think this is a bigger problem which you have been a victim of... the media can make any event into whatever they need to get clicks or push a narrative. Love this video and you man keep up the good work and even better view

I see Felix is still mad at the &quot;media&quot;!

plz do more of this videos

Man i love when you do this kind of vídeos.

Hey Felix? Uh, Joaquin is a Spanish name

Society

I feel like I just listened to Felix reading a research paper he wrote in high school. Not saying it was bad just it was structured like a research paper

I love when he makes these high-effort, intellect videos.

I do fully agree with you but, Ok boomer I mispelt something

This is probably the fist Pewdipie video, to not appear in my feed in a long time. I had to manually look for the video, after being told about it by a friend.

Felix get more view then the MSN that&#39;s why they all hate him.  Mean while he&#39;s using his power in a very thoughtful way and has matured over the years.

There is actually a term used in the media industry called &#39;moral panic&#39; which is when the media aggressively cover a story again and again which creates fear around an issue

How about another joke Murray?

“The irony being that the media helps create bad people by platforming them, all the while simultaneously thinking they’re better than them.” - This comment alone deserves another 100M subscribers

Its videos like this and his book video that remind me that his not just a shit poster, but actually a very intelligent and well-spoken person.

Please make more videos like this!

I feel like not enough people will watch this because of the name of the video

amazing take man, really interesting

I remember when the dark knight rises attack happened. I don&#39;t think that Joker will inspire events like that, though

Nothing happened at the Joker movie, yet at Frozen 2 a massive brawl broke out with teenagers, some with machetes.

Someone in the comments wrote this: (I don&#39;t like how they do this with joker but not the purge) Well, clearly you missed the whole point of the video. The purge is a horror movie, not real life. But if you keep motivating it I guess it will. I&#39;m not saying your opinion is bad, i&#39;m saying it&#39;s interesting. Especially after watching this video.

I liked the joker movie it was a very aesthetic movie

THANK YOU!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Pewdiepie... disguise yourself as chumlee from porn stars in next Halloween thanks

PewDiePie: promotes message of mental health and caring for other people.Vox Media: There is nothing here to make a story out of, move on.

The Telegraph is sadly a trash paper I couldn&#39;t even be bothered to wipe my ass with if I ran out of toilet paper.

<a href="">4:10</a> my friend actually fell when she was lmao

I just wanna claim dish world for myself and heaven for myself. And Hell for my enemy and people I dislike. Gonna torture people I dislike. Play them the way they played me. I am gonna fuck every girl I fond. And doesnt have child from it because Iam gonna kill the babies. Fuck n fuck 4ever. Goes on&amp;on. Gonna do everyting I want and get everyting I want.

Liked the format

Your so smart thats why i watch your channel

Obviously the big D paid the media channels to bash the Joker brand because WB DC is their rival brand.

Thank you Felix, very cool.

Stupidity=Ignorance = fear = hateNot in all the cases but in the majority we can follow the hate and the hate will go to the ignorance, fear is more complicated to find cause few people acknowledge fear and understand the reasons and connections with hate and ignorance

Actually really good point

Dark Knight Rises is such a good movie, such a CLEAR, CLEAN-CUT and stimulating movie, are you seriously saying The Joker is better?

Joaquin is spanish not english that is why it is &quot;mispelled&quot;

Movies don&#39;t make people kill or mass murder, I played GTA san andreas from age 13 onwards, and I don&#39;t go round beating old old ladies to death with giant purple dildo&#39;s.

Jared Leto laughs like Waluigi

Dang, this is the deepest i&#39;ve seen Felix go and i have an even deeper respect for him now.

we need more videos like these at least once a week about any topic you have interests in.no face camserious talk

Anyone know the source of the joker CGI clips? Like Pamtri.

I still haven&#39;t seen the movie because the theatrical release just has to be 2 entire fucking months before the retail release.Do you think I have friends or something? I&#39;m not gonna go see a film alone by my self in a theater. I don&#39;t even think they allow that for this film.

i want a marcus persson minecraft memes review

Wall Street journal just had an add on your vid.

I like this format.

Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best, his work with James Gray &amp; PTA were confidential masterpieces.

More of this please. Love to listen to these essays

Amazing video
Our boi, he&#39;s redpilled. Current freakin&#39; year.

Watched this without realizing this was pewds kinda crazy how well this video is

Did you guys hear that there was an attack at a cinema?It wasn&#39;t at a cinema with Joker. It wasn&#39;t straight white incel men.It was at a cinema with Frozen 2. It was almost a hundred &#39;asian&#39; (which is woke cover-speak for Pakistani) teenagers. They were wielding machetes.  MACHETES &amp; Frozen 2. Can&#39;t make this shit up.The. Irony.

i want a full on review by pewds

The fact that the media is saying it might be a dangerous movie shows the Big Brother attitude they have towards movies

I want more of these type of videos

I went to see this with my Mom. She is schizophrenic... Like a week later she asked me if I wanted to go see it again with her...

I gave this video a like the moment I saw the Leto/Squidward comparison.

This is like FTC, COPPA(the news).. they blame us,(the movie) when we (the movie) didn&#39;t do anything wrong. They should blame the parents (kids that acted weird for the film and stuff) for the problems caused.

That&#39;s exactly it. I&#39;ve been listening to Castells, philosopher that studies communication technologies and societal cognitive behaviors. He explains how causing these spectacles out of movies, games or even real life riots won&#39;t make people afraid of producing content or acting upon their beliefs, because those beliefs are well founded, since they have been developed through the past decade or so. This &quot;banning and fear&quot; culture does nothing; if people do act violently, there is plenty more history and reasons behind it, the movie won&#39;t change someone&#39;s values in 2 hours. They might help trigger something, but, just like games like Mortal Kombat, it cannot be held accountable for the decisions or mental state of its viewers. And yes, the media actually just put more fuel to the fire of potential violence, instead of help control or prevent it.

And now look what’s happened outside a Frozen II screening....that’s the real danger film right there

Def not a movie about mental health but it’s a fine film.

Finally, somebody speaks the truth about the media portrayal of movies. It was an amazing movie and experience.

Joaquin was perfect he’s had a sad life and he actually put his heart into this performance

I don&#39;t hate the suicide squad joker. I think it was just a different version. It was more of a realistic take, but still being in a fantasy world. Not the best, of course but it wasn&#39;t as bad as people are making out to be. The movie wasn&#39;t even about the joker anyways.I personally don&#39;t give a fuck about what actors do outside the movies, I separate the art from the artist and I think everyone should do the same.

Good video 👍🏻
Memes huh
<b>PEOPLE WHERE JUDGING A BOOK BY IT&#39;S COVER , AND WHERE ALSO STATING HOW SMART THEY ARE FROM DOING SO!</b>

Damn
I did actually get worried by Joker, as the media did convince me it could be an issue. And honestly, I watched the movie and I did genuinely think the movie had the chance to provoke certain people into a bad mindset. I did enjoy it however.

Agreed

He used the 100 subs Video in the beginning

With the Dark Knight shooting, the killer had stated that he chose that movie because he simply wanted to kill as many people as possible and it was a full house for premier night. Other than that he could have chosen any movie, any place as long as it had as lot of people. He had been planning for a while to kill a lot of people, he was simply waiting for the right moment; i.e. a packed house like a &#39;can of sardines&#39;. A truly disturbed individual that had no ties to the batman universe.It&#39;s sad, but this is not the first time it&#39;s happened and people blame movies, music, games, and other media when it&#39;s simply the fact that this person is a violent psychopath at birth. The zodiac killer also had no motive other than killing, Bundy too. People need to accept that there are people out there who are just not right in the head, and it has nothing to do with their environment. There is no way you can prevent it no matter what you outlaw. You can make a bomb with the items you have in your kitchen and bathroom in a plastic water bottle. Killers will find a way to kill, learn self defense instead of boosting useless propaganda. You&#39;ll live longer, and be less biased and judgmental.

Just want to highlight that I love these type of videos. These and your philosophy videos are among my favorites

Pyro is proud

NOCEBO, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EFFECT OF NOCEBO.

Should do more vids like this

You truly deserve to be the king of youtube.. Great message.

When Felix says Joaquin’s name it sounds like “ quacking “

Pewds should do this more

i really like this side of felix when i gets deep in these types of stuff while still being funny damm boy got a smart braine

One of the greatest philosophers of our time

Awesome video pewds you really clearly stated the facts. You made a logical assessment of those facts and i enjoyed every second! But you wrong about his name😂

I LOVE that he doesn&#39;t say the Aurora Shooter&#39;s name, just calls him exactly what he is. The Terrorist. We know the names of too serial killers, and not enough names of their victims.

Joker was great movie and Joaquin Phoenix was amazing

<b>like and your mom will live forever</b>

Felix: Seiriously, why can&#39;t we just call him Joeceem Phoenix. English language, please.



Ok, Felix Kellbög
Ngl pewds actually would make a great voice over channel. Even better than the British csgo surfing people

I love these type of videos from you. Well said!

I hate the Joker movie as a Joker movie, but slap any other title on it and build your own world around the concept then I’d love it. The movie is creatively bankrupt by simply stealing the names of recognizable characters to falsely market the movie as something it is not. The movie has nothing to do with the actual Joker and the connections made to the overarching world are flimsy at best. DC shit the bed on what could have been an actually good attempt at a villain movie. Instead we get a movie about mental illness that has almost nothing to do with the Batman mythos.

got em. way to go Felix

If the media (which ironically enough is full of boomers) could just shUT <b>UP</b>everything would be fine

What does a pinned comment look like

How can pewds be the funniest person on youtube aswell as smarter than any journalist on any platform?

Im begining to think pewdiepie likes japan

Any good movies premieres The media: RAPE

I love that you made this video, what a nice clean reaction on something important

<b>TERRARIA SERIES!</b>

my mom still won’t let me see the movie

More vids like these!

Do Robert Downey Jr

Finally, some good fucking opinion

who else just loves when Pewdiepie reviews movies lol
