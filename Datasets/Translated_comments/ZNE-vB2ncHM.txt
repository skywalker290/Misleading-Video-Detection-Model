One of the best compositions of recent times! Couldn&#39;t resist doing a piano version of this song on my channel. Check it out if u are reading this, and let me know what you feel about my version

Nepotism movie Truly a kalank movie for india.  I saw this in prime and  vomited for five days.  Alia need to get national award in acting category.  Karan you are a kalank for India.

Nepotism se bhari bakwaas log hero and heroine agar maa baap kaam na dilate Inke tho kuch na hota inse. Tortures acting with this good lyrics

Karan johar sun le jo mafia raha hain tu tere hoga hoga bade tarike se <a href="">#baykt</a> karan johar

The voice of soul - Arijit Singh 

This movie is a flop because it promotes Love Jihad. Btw I love religion. I am not against Muslims but I hate both the religions and want to create a riot.
Lines r damm impressive I hope It will become more osom with my guitar

@DharmaProductions This is the Best song. Loved  it.

Film is not good but song is awesome
