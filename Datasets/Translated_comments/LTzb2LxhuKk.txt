Bandit Queen was traumatizing experience for me, even more horrible thing is, this movie is a biopic.

What about the rape scene in Bulbul??? It was the hardest thing i had watched in a movie? I couldn’t sleep for nights 😭😭😭😭

Have u guys ever seen kamal&#39;s mahanadi It&#39;s the most disturbing movie in indian cinema

matrabhoomi by far the most disturbing movie for me..... u can also add bandit queen to your list..some scenes were really tough to watch.... and even malayalam movie biriyaani can make it to ur list ... i found it very very difficult to watch

Deshdrohi

Analytical and Awarding for the Audiences. Applauds ( For the channel)❤️Suggestion from a movie buff- Films inspired from real life. (With or w/o modifications)

I watched matrubhoomi years ago, I haven&#39;t had the courage to watch it again. But recommend it to be watched once.

LSD&#39;S Honour killing

There is nothing hard to see.

Don&#39;t say indian movies   These are all Bollywood

Jammy, I recommend you to watch DROHKAAL.

It&#39;s hard for me to watch when rashmika &amp; Pooja acting..😑

Pataal lok- You know what scene I&#39;m talking about

Yeah I too got to know about this matrbhoomi movie maybe a year back but yup it kindaa shocked me

You forgot to mention &quot; satyemev jayte 2&quot;.

I get traumatised just by listening this.

I&#39;ve watched raman raghav it was a nice movie

Mardaani 2 scenes and also main hoon danddhikari movies scenes that disturbed me a lot...should hve been there

The bandit queen, kept me clicking fast forward on how disturbing it was

Chandini bar was also very disturbing especially what happens with Tabu&#39;s son in Juvenile jail was very hard to watch

Mahanadhi by Kamalhaasan should be in this list.

Trigger Warning:In Pataal lok, I don&#39;t remember the characters&#39; names (and I really don&#39;t want to revisit it right now), there is scene where in flashback it shows how one of the accused&#39;s mother is raped by the whole village in front of her family in broad daylight due to caste based reasons. Seriously can&#39;t imagine how actors do it and how they deal with it afterwards even. Must be traumatic.I&#39;m already sorry to anyone who is reading this and is reminded of the scene or even if they have to imagine it.

Sunil Shetty Asin Sharman Joshi
Harman Baweja, Shilpa Shetty Genelia Ayesha Takia
..Where are these Bollywood stars 

<a href="">

Masan opening scene was also really disturbing

Laxmi movie is also unbearable

i happened to watch matrubhoomi and it has haunted me for yearsss..it is beyond my understanding what tulip joshi must have gone through while preparing and acting for the movie. More than that, my heart aches and goes out to the women who went through this barbaric and non-consensual treatment.

Laxmi was the most disturbing movie I watched.  Bigg boss is another disturbing show I watched.

I still haunted by that page 3 scene 😶

Bro ur work is awesome....but if possible can u pls change intro

Another gem of a movie feathering Adil Hussein is What will people say that is in some scene too brutal to watch

Un-freedom: The story about a lesbian daughter whose father is brutally against climaxes into a scene where the father gets the whole police station rape his daughter in the cell in an attempt to ‘normalise’ her sexual preference and watches the deed through while she screams. The movie ends with both the characters making eye contact. Adil Hussein is a gem actor and his acting 🔥🔥

i have watched matrabhoomi and it&#39;s really disturbing but it depicts harsh reality of the society where in some areas women are still being treated like this.

Bulbul is also one of them.

Welcome back ✋🏼😐
Bandit Queen rape scene And humiliation by Thakur&#39;s should have been top of the list

Reality is always harsh and unbearable.

You should review Priyasakhi movie, I feel like that movie showcases on many double standards

In the series Patallok when the village PPL rape the mother one by one was hard to watch

I was having lunch thank you🙂👍

A Serbian film
Radhe dekha aur ab main trauma mai hoon 😭

people talking about having problem with men marrying 2-3 women and not women marrying 2-3 men,,needs to watch matrabhoomi..

❤️❤️. Incest ❤️🔥
The story of &quot;Omar&quot; is similar to one of episodes of &quot;made in India&quot; TV series. And both the film &amp; series have &quot;arjun mathur&quot; as cast! I guess &quot;made in india&quot; took inspiration from &quot;omar&quot;

I think you should add Sara Ali Khan&#39;s &quot;Tum mujhe tang karne lage ho&quot; from LAK 2

I honestly thought it was sidharth malhotra in I am poster.😳

In Anniyan/Aparichit movie there was a scene where ambi was packed in a cover and beated like a boxing bag was damn disturbing

Watching Radhe is the most disturbing experience

Lajja should be there in the list- Mob attack on Madhuri dixit, rape scene of Rekha was very disturbing...

I think you are a gay 😂

South Indian movies has a good storyline but some dialogues and scenes are so shameful to watch and hear like heroes always tried to save heroines from horror villains and following her without her consent and such many more things aren&#39;t enjoyable to me 😐sorry if someone get hurted by my lines...

I don&#39;t understand why we let white people narate our stories: aka Matrubhumi. It&#39;s getting old at this point. Let&#39;s take charge of our narration.

Madhuri(pregnant) beaten by some female constable in some old movie in which SRK was mentally ill! Can&#39;t recall the movie

Dil se : The scenes were amar manhandling meghna in the name of love and forcefully kissing her ( dessert scene) made me sick to watch it further. Maniratnam movies are great, but dil se is the one that i couldn&#39;t watch completely and  made me think about how stalking and toxic masculinity is normalised as romance in movies

There was the whole sequence in mom where the girl was being r*ped and then was found floating in the gutters 😔

Few scenes of article 15 too ..... Pathetic scenes , can&#39;t imagine that human beings r so brutal .....

staying away from all these movied  specially the first one

NH10 and Badlapur were also pretty hard to watch, but I can&#39;t even think about watching the ones you mentioned here.

There is a Tamil movie kaadhal its climax is very disturbing. I couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days. And if course the whole movie of Welcome home was very disturbing

Watch love Sonia. You ll find series of jighly disturbing scenes  😥😥

you should include &#39; what will people say &#39; to this list

Very informative and good clipping. Wow wonderful video as I can say you know the art to present simple items in shape of gold and diamonds. It would not be wrong that you can attract huge number of viewers at the notice of shortest time. I like your video and appreciate you from the core of my heart as your video/ sound/ graphic is the best combination to create great retention of the listeners/ viewers. You mixed up the video shorts with appropriate timings and best fitted arrangement. No doubt you are wonderful and deserve many many likes as I acknowledge and appreciate your effort to the maximum level. Thanks for sharing and waiting for more like this. I say you the best in your future endures.  Best Regards

T.w.: tradition &amp; rapeThere&#39;s a tradition that is practised in Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, of woman being married to multiple men (polyandry), which is said to be based on the story of pandavas, and the name is also that (pandava). It was savdhaan India episode which made me aware of it.. (I had googled it as well just to confirm that I wasn&#39;t wrong -- for anyone who wants to know more, type &quot;polyandry in India&quot;).And the scene at <a href="">3:12</a> actually caused me to google &quot;&quot;woman kept in cowshed to be raped by passers&quot;&quot;, which led me to this horrifying piece:<a href=""> I googled only because I thought that the scene was inspired by some real life incident.

Udta Punjab was so artificial.

For me &#39;Tango Charlie&#39; when they tied young  Vishal Thakkar to a tree, tore his shirt apart and terribly starts cutting his chest with knife. Used him as bait to catch Indian Soldiers. That scene was horrifying.

Well the directors intentionally want these to be unbearable, I guess

There are even sceans in Akashvani which are hard to watch

Is it only me or anyone else also noticed that jammy voice is bit low compared to his normal entertaining voice?Seems like he is having a sore throat or blocked nose.

I saw the movie Raman Raghav yesterday and that scene shocked me

Hi

Hu

I&#39;m never watching these movies now. Can&#39;t stomach such scenes

this was beyond disturbing and depressing

Trapped movie also makes uncomfortable

If you have watched got and the boys then these all are just a piece of cake

How could you forget that one scene from Bhaag Milkha Bhaag?

That movie about a 2 yr old in a house where her mom is dead...

Even two sequences in Bulbul: 1) the intellectually challenged brother raping the protagonist and 2) The husband of the protagonist beating her to breaking her legs. Unbearable.

I must say clickbait at its finest

I cried watching matrubhoomi i was so disappointed

Oh1947 earth has some of these really difficult to watch scenes too

Make video about she series

Ugly, Bandit Queen, parts in Damini.

Nawazuddin Sidiqui is one of the best actors in the industry

Oh ffs can we help this man reach a million,  his content is awesome!!!!!!

Bro uh need to watch welcome home on sony liv..uh will actually come to know what ugly scenes are.

🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄alia bhatt bakwass

Shoe licking scene from Kalapani a 1995 malayalam movie starring mohanlal...

This was a gem.The movies mentioned here are actually gut wrenching.I missed out on watching I Am. So will add that to my list now

Can some kind soul please give references for the OTT platforms where I can watch these movies

you forgot laxmi... it is horrifying .. i found it on youtube and dreaded the day i watched it

I felt very uncomfortable while watching &#39;Love Sonia&#39;. Great film but oh god it had some very disturbing scenes.

Hello can you please mention the ott platform name with movie title

Raman raghava is really disturbing film

Bulbul&#39;s rape scene by chote babu(Rahul Bose) when she was badly injured is hard to watch for me.

You know it was so hard to just listen to the plots, I wonder how you watched the films... Respect!

It&#39;s an  irony that extremely hard to watch scenes compilation video has 3.2 million views

I depressed for a whole week after watching Matrubhoomi

Paruthiveeran.
I watched V.I.P Korean movie and that movie is not for everyone

You missed Bandit Queen , which will give you chills down your spine n nightmares  . Its disturbing n extremely difficult to watch

BA pass was disturbing too

You should watch paruthi veeran climax then

Andha Kanoon is another film

I am sure there are many more but the recent movie welcome home on Sony Liv is a bone chilling thriller and few scenes are gut wrenching

Here&#39;s one movie I want to suggest you to discuss in a video.. please give a chance to Laxmi by nagesh kukunur. It is an outstanding movie. And if you like it, kindly consider it to be included in your next video, for I think that kind of movies are really needed to be seen by the masses.

The movie AJJI was absolutely nerve shaking too.

Wow this channel is beautiful loved it❤❤

Video was fine.just change the title name to bollywood movies 🤣

Pedophilia scene from page 3 was very disturbing for me

Watch Paruthiveeran (tamil) climax.

Anurag kashyap is 3rd class

wonder if they will ever make a picture on halala..

Matrubhoomi was unbearable

I will never be able to forget Matrubhumi

It&#39;s the media and the entertainment industry that forces on such a sick mentality.. I mean just imagine if there was no media and such a poor unrealistic entertainment industry our people would have been more and more accepting and logical enough 🙄

Katrina kaif, sunny leone in hindi movies is extremely difficult to watch 😌

Why didn&#39;t I not subscribe  you all these days? Critical stuff... keep it up brother..

You missed a movie, name Hostel

MirzapurFather in law raping his daughter in law by Blackmailing

Every salmon bhai movieExcept for bajarigni bhaiyajan

Seriously Alia Bhatt did Udta Punjab and still questions notorious BOLLYWOOD

I stopped watching any harmful acting of Arjun Kapoor......it is disturbing and mentally suffocating

Crappy compilation there are better and well made movies and characters.

Mere karan arjun aayenge hard to watch
For me Kabhi khushi kabhi kam was extremely disturbing and hard to watch especially the Kareena kapoor’s expression were barbaric.

Can you watch Ram Gopal Varma ki Aag and not develop some mental disorder 🤔??....pain will soon follow..

You have to watch this film “Lakshmi” by Nagesh kukunoor the entire film is extremely disturbing....

Bcoz of Bollywood so much of wrong information has been customized into younger and older people 🥺🥺🥺

Thank you,  I came to know about some those subjects, for which, the Bollywood was attentive and focused..

Awesome 👍
Abe thoda hindi me b bol le,,, taake dusro ko b samaj aaye

I have watched matrubhoomi and as a women or any individual the entire movie was very very hard to watch for me. I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t even watch through scenes... It left me under its effect for days and the barbaric acts made its way to my mind for much longer period... I would recommend everyone to watch it once and see how much barbaric acts women(real/fictional) had to go through. If this doesn&#39;t give you chill or you find those scenes alluring then my friend you need a consultation.

Also the scene form bulbul when mahindar molest bulbul also when idranil molest her.... Extremely hard to watch....

SOTY2 and PATI PATNI AUR WOH was pretty hard for me to watch...

I cannot to this day watch new york and sarbjit

Now such things are prevalent on OTTs

I'm not reviewing you
The most unbearable thing to watch is Aa.. na.. nya.. pandey..

Yes I have seen a part of Matrabhumi,but after watching a part was so disturbed by it,today I know the name of movie scary to think about the women who faces such situations 💔💔💔💔💔💔

In Hollywood, I would say &#39;pathology&#39; is the most disturbing movie to watch.

Dangerous ones are I am and matribhumi

Ur English talking is fine.

The Haunted rape scene of tia Bajpai was very very disturbed.. and in the ghost also the scene  of the killing of the foreign grl was also disturbing

For me shakti the power movie  is very hard to watch.feeling dipressed after watching this movie

On a Video Platform, why are you showing images, Wouldn&#39;t it be better to try print media ?

I have watched I am.... Typical Bollywood... Very subtly and craftily trying to whitewash the exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits... Tired and sick of appeasement and pseudo secularism 🤬🤬🤬

To watch Ashutosh Rana in sangharsh movie in childhood was scary to watch

What was the music used in intro... Can anyone tell me

1947 earth is hard to watch

Scene from the ae dhil hai mushkil

For me sarabjit movie was intolerable....was weeping throughout the movie. Dnt hv courage to watch tht again.

I am ok. I am not disturb, may be you   have problem.

I remember watching page 3 in my colg times...in has never left my mind since...it&#39;s too disturbing

Girl harassment scene in telugu movie temper.. it is also remade in Hindi ...simba.. extremely hard to watch

It&#39;s hard to watch bollywood 😂

For me all salman movies r hard to watch !

Such movies must not be shown in public ,yar aise hi itne criminals hai society me,uper se directors ,kaise aisi movies bana lete hai,such directors,story writes and actors themselves are dangerous for society....cinemas must be full of healthy and positive thought, and must reform the society but not promote criminal ideas to those criminal heads🙏🏻 Anurag kashyap must stop making films ,his movies speak about  his sick mentality....

That ending scene from Saif and Urmila&#39;s &#39;Ek hasina thi&#39; was more disturbing to watch. Watching film from start you feel he deserve such treatment.

Aah tulip joshi tied in a shed to be raped by anyone in the village 😣😣😣These canes r horrible n I cannot come to an understanding as how ppl have commented all these weird silly comments after ur vdo

The human centipede most disturbing movie ever...

I know it&#39;s a comment after 2 years... But I think Nagesh Kuknoor&#39;s Lakshmi should have made the list. Acted by Monali Thakur. Urghhhh DISTURBING

Hard ending Bandit queen.70s 80s had Samaj ko badal Dalo Meri awaz Suno ending hard.
you missed Lakshmi (2014), chandani bar (2001) and Bol (2011)

Hotel Mumbai was really hard to watch I was crying for the first time seeing a movie  🙁😭😭😭😭

Love Sonia is hard for me to watch

You forgot about bandit Queen... Rape scene

The scene from movie ghost when they crucify that girl is also very disturbing

Where can I find the movie &quot;Matrubhoomi&quot;?

Comment section proves why indian cinema is still so appalling.

What boys also not safe in this society 🙄

Watching janhvi and sonam kapoor trying to act is the hardest.

U missed out phulan debi

race 3... bagghi 3..  cutiyya  of the year 2 also hard to Watch

You didn&#39;t give spoiler alert!!!!!😎😠😠😠😠😠

chandni bar. must visit

Sadak 2 Trailer + Movie = Defination of Hard

The matrbhoomi scene made me quite uncomfortable. It was really hard to watch.

It took me 4 days to get over bandit Queen! 😑😑😑

Sarabjit TulsiPaan Singh TomarKesariBandit queenLaxmiBorder Lajja
I thought you would include a movie- Laxmi. That is one hella disturbing movie. I was disturbed for so long after watching that movie. And I am a pretty thick skinned woman.

Matrabhumi was soo so disturbing that I wanted to forget the movie as it was stucked in my mind for few days and I hate this.. watching a women like this in the society and her value.. can&#39;t explain the feeling..worst than getting goosebumps...that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t recommend to anyone.

I really want to watch these but couldn&#39;t find these anywhere, especially Matrubhoomi. You should tell where to find these.

Could you also tell where to watch these movies?

You should watch “what will people say”. Its an independent film with Indian actors based on a Norwegian- pakistani storyline which is true.

Watch the movie Lakshmi played by singer Monali Thakur where she had to please customers even while having high fever. Very disturbing

Ending of ugly movie is disturbing

Monali Thakur in lakshmi movie 😶 she acts so brilliantly..but the rawness.. of the movie

Why is UGLY not in the list Disappointed

Nawaz serial killer movie was indeed too much. Though I do watch Hollywood horror. But this was closer to home raw and brutal. Unwatchable.

Christopher Nolan and Quintin Tarantino make a video on them

Make a video on Christopher Nolan

Make a video on Christopher Nolan or Quintin Tarantino

Christopher Nolan or Quintin Tarantino make a video on them

Christopher Nolan or Quintin Tarantino

Christopher Nolan

Make a video on Christopher Nolan

Really ...When i saw matrubhumi .... I was very upset for some days....Very very very hard to watch 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

Page 3 scene was really really painful well I am sort of don&#39;t watch disturbing scene which leave a trauma that hard to get out for me....but watching page 3 thought of a normal movie as a film goes I can&#39;t held my back watched whole movie Its really really painful took a month to come out of it,,,,I really don&#39;t want any children to go through abuse that trauma will leave a deep scar

Secret Super star movie watch disturbing  booring
It&#39;s very hard for me to watch Ananya Pandey acting or speaking. :/

bro what have you said so far...why brother why?
Selvaraghavan&#39;s movies should be in this list

Dude, great oratory. I can listen to you without phasing out all day. Good work 👍

Your voice is like news reporter

Matrubhoomi is extremely disturbing right from the first scene when the mam forcibly drowns the new born baby girl in a vat of milk.

Murder 2 would have been an honorable mention. The antagonist played my Prashant Narayanan actually sends shivers down ur spine.

Salman bhai's name should not be mentioned in the thumbnail.
Agree....Ugly movie&#39;s climax scene was also hard to watch for me nd Recently the rape scene of Bulbbul too 🥺

I really like the speaker&#39;s voice ❤️

Page 3 is sooo plastic.

Except matrabhumi...watched all the movies...all are masterpiece

She&#39;s good for fashion show not acting

Yes absolutely true zayd Muhammad it&#39;s absolutely very hard to see Sonam Kapoor act because she doesn&#39;t act she does only and only overacting

I find your speech to be word to word copied from wiki.. Esp the I am movie section and mattrobhomi section.. Making me. Wonder do you really watch movies or just take text from wiki and come. Up with your inference

WellMehhh. Nothing so dramatic. Go try and watch other movies form other states and you will see some crazy things. Don’t stay in a bubble. ✌️

Houseful 4 is also hard to watch

In Sangharsh movie the Way Ashutosh starts screaming somehow terrifies you and I think it is hard to watch...

Make a list of South Indian movies as well

I have watched matrabhoomi few days ago this movie is full of pain my tears came out after watching it

There are so many good movies we know nothing about

But these are the realities of our life and its good for the film makers to make us be aware

What is Ramanaaaa?

For me, Jab Harry met Sejal was really tough to watch. It took me almost a month. I used to pause and then again pause 🤭😂

The movie &#39;Siddharth&#39; is very difficult to watch. It&#39;s available on amazon prime, but it&#39;s a rollercoaster of emotions.

&#39;Salaam Bombay&#39; is very difficult to watch. I watched it many years ago but still I can feel the pain of that innocent child who wants to go to her mother but he couldn&#39;t.

i love ur voice..😍
Another scene I found horrible, real and disturbing: Bulbull scene - the point retarded brother in law approached Bulbull in bed (oh god so horrible)

I really don&#39;t like that movies jis me girls ko molest kiya jata h .I was 7 yrs old when I see movie lajja I was loudly crying by see seen when madhuri was molested  and rekha was raped. It was v bad experience.

Your english is very nice and also the choice of words...

Kalapani... where a prison inmate was forced to eat human faeces with a help of a funnel shoved down the throat.Girl with yellow boots... where the last twist was completely out of the world.

Madhur Bhandarkar movie Chadni Bar where a boy gets raped by two boys inside a jail.

Bandit Queen

Movie name is matribhumi
0.18 john abraham which movie??

The recent extreme seens I watched is the Bulbul movie scene....it&#39;s quite disturbing

One scene from shoot out at Vadala.....very hard to watch....where he crushed someone&#39;s head in ice crusher....

Say hindi cinema not indian movies. South Indian movies have more real and shocking scenes

Yes very true some movies has really very uncomfortable n disturbing scenes which should cut off from the movie to prevent negative thoughts.

Awesome list. We&#39;ll put together

Raman Raghav was really disturbing

Tubelight &amp; Zero is also very hard to watch...

It&#39;s hardly to watch but in reality look at our society come down on streets

Scenes of ghazni were also hard to watch

Zero, Thugs Of Hindustan, also hard to watch...

The movie &#39;ajji&#39; where it has the scene of minor girl being raped , her suffering etc !!! The movie is good, but difficult to watch the scenes 🥺

Matrubhumi ,Lakshmi,Bandit Queen the beginning scene of the movie gunday where the little boy beg to the police officer not to rape <a href="">him.is</a> really hard for me to watch.

Garbage movie 😟

Trp you have million views on some videos because of thumb 😂

Arjun Kapoor is extremely hard to watch

मातृभूमी is a good movie everybody did good job but heroin work is sucks
Dabangg 2 was so hard to watch that I had to take anti depression pills after watching it🤣🤣🤣

Any Karan johar movie is a terrible terrible &amp; difficult thing to watch...

I am alive after watching kalank in theatre...  Bravery award kahan hai🤔

Lipstick under my burkha has several scenes specially where they  show brutal non consensual sex between a couple (Konkana Sen) , I&#39;m calling it  non consensual sex and not Marital rape because it falls under the domain of tacit consent and is hard to watch

Your content is too good man! I am actually influenced by your writing style! Amazing keep it up! 😇

Masaan hotel scene should also be included

The title should be “5 shocking Bollywood movie scenes that are extremely difficult to watch” there is no Indian in it😏

The scene of Putting acid in eyes was also hard to watch in prakash jha&#39;s Gangajal.

Chandani bar last 15 minutes...And of course Machis.

Anyone remember that scene from slumdog millionair when that guy  removes the eyes of that little girl while she was singing bhajan. That was quite disturbing too.

honestly i find almost every, yeah nearly each and every bollywood movie hard to watch.

Matrabhoomi was one of a kind..it left me with an intense feeling for days..I remember when I first saw the movie and in the end when Kalki decides to keep her daughter i was so frustrated..I could not believe that after going through soo much she had the courage to bring her daughter to that crude disgusting world.

Ae Dil Hain Mushkil was also pretty hard to watch

Yeah I watched matrubhoomi Hardest movie to watch buttMust 2 watch as thats the reality

Ugli the child dead body is unbearable to watch

Matrubhoomi, really hard to watch.

Just see &#39;Irreversible&#39;...It is absolutely unwatchable not because lame content but because of pure brutality and depression....

I remember 1 Scene From - Khatta metha... Akshay Kumar - Sisters Raped by His husbands friends...

Saw this movie ..years back ....🥺🥺🥺but still fresh in my memory ...it was so ..so ..sad to watch ....and the purpose , message leaves its impact strongly on everybody’s mind ...actors were brilliant , subject was real , direction was subtle , concept and story was not glorified or sensationalised or commercialised..Apparently ...movie compel and force us to think about the subject seriously ...👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

What about Bandit queen ??!!! It was devastating!!!!

What about the movie<b>Lakshmi</b>Didn&#39;t even made to the list guys

I watch Korean movies and they’re just as mind blowing, they’re absolutely unpredictable and thrilling, if you guys wish to watch something of that sort then you should definitely explore Korean cinema

Is this Bangalore

Where is this house

How disgusting would have been these scenes in real life.

Add movie garbage to the list

Marathi movies also have more disturbing realistic scenes as they have realistic approach in thier movies one particular scene I like to mention is of nachya&#39;s rape from the movie natarang which was the hit of the year plzz make some videos on marathi movies also

That climax of page 3 really horrified me for weeks,it was disgusting 🤢

Laxmi was a hard movie to watch.

All scenes from Kabir singh and arjun Reddy is hard to watch

Have you ever seen Ananya Pande struggling with acting?
What&#39;s the name of the last gay movie??

Amrish Puri dog scene in Ghatak
1947 earth was quiet hard to watch

A short movie&#39; bypass&#39; is also sickening.

Thanks for the list I will make sure never to watch these. Though Page 3 already done. Unfortunately.

Don&#39;t watch..raman raghav2. 0..That&#39;s extremely disturbing movie.

bhaag milkha bhaag scene when a man called milkha&#39;s sister in their tent and little milkha can hear that annoying voice of breathe

Plz make part two

I'm not kidding
The way he said I AM haha

I wonder why the movie Hungry hasn&#39;t been included here.... The murder scenes were very difficult to watch....

Film &quot;Luxmi&quot; is based on true story. A 14 yr old girl is sold by her father into prostitution.. how she is compelled to do all of those nasty things that too with a smile.. when she tries to escape, she is caught and punished by Chinna, who also punishes the brothel head when she allows an NGO person  into brothel.. Those scenes are extremely hard &amp; uncomfortable to watch..

This scene from Page 3 was really sickening!

Dark side of humanity 👹

1st raman raghav 2.02nd udta punjab 3rd page 34th matrubhoomi 5th I am
Please make a video in Hindi please.

<a href="">

There are still people : who does marriage according to Panchali&#39;       marriage  who criticize same gender relationship   who are serial killers  who are addicted to drugs  who are kidnapped we should question ourself we are living in 21 Century those we are thinking according to 21 Century ..... 💖💖💖💖💖

Bandit queen phoolon devi
But Raman Raghav was stone man murderer

Bollywood is mostly in Hindi language, please watch the logs made in Hindi, Hinglish will also work but it will not work.
All house full 1 2 3 are disturbing too

1947 earth . The climax scene where Rahul Khanna is killed and heroin is forcibly captured from her hidden place. It really leaves extremely bitter taste of partition

Thanks for suggesting movies 😵😵
Great content

Where can i watch the movie matrubhoomi- a nation without women. Can you please share the link ?

Katrina kaif hot scene with gulshan Grover was hard to watch for me.😭

What about laxmi 😞😞😞😞

PADMAVAT was hard to watch...johar scene and shahid murder

These r all real incident ... There r no disturbing thing in these movie ..... These movies showing what is going on😠😠😠😠😠

bhoomi rape scene - too difficult to watch

&#39;Laxmi&#39; should be there in the list.

roy

W T F ?

Rape scenes were so common in Hindi movies a few decades ago. It’s as if every director makes this list for a movie with 6 songs, 5 fights, 2 rape scenes.... they were quite graphic in nature as well. The one that I would not forget is a scene were a little girl gets raped. I saw it on tv and I myself was a little girl back then sadly.

I just cant imagine watching maatrbhoomi. Just listening the plot of story in this video gave me chills. I even cant understand that is in reality. Be it any religion women are just used by men on the name of customs, culture. Basically they want to fulfil their sexual desires behind such rape cum cultures.

Kareena ki overacting is hard to watch

Bollywood means casting couch, story less film, sex comedy, sleazy sex scene,

Change the title to hindi movies not  indian movies. Indian movie doesn&#39;t contain only hindi language movies.  There are many other languages too. Before doing any videos just research on the local environmental stuff and give the exact caption for that. Hereafter if you want to review hindi films specific the title like indian hindi films not like indian films.

Did the police man rape Omar with his stick?

I know kabir Singh is blockbuster movie but story and scene is so disturbing .It is not watchable movie.😕😕😕😕😕

its hard for me to watch Sonam kapoor acting...😂

matrabhoomi was very very hard to watch and its even harder too imagine that this is happening and will happen more . because lack of girls in india .

Paruthiveeran
You analyze with great effort, so subscribe 😊
All balayya movies even more hard to watch

I really like the way you talk n your voice

roy movie was also hard to watch

The comments section!.... seriously?! ...

U should also add scenes of &quot; bandit queen&quot; where a child named Phoolan of about 5-7 years was  brutually exploited by her husband .. it was really hard to see.

Tried and refused production just an advice....Your presentation and voice is very good...so you dont need to use background  music so often or If u use, use different musics .....same music is being played in every video of yours....just a progressive advice... Anyway I like your channel n contents very much...great going guys 👍

Salman Veer and Nargis fakhri Amavas really hard to watch

Pihu hard to watch movie

Kalank is the best film from Bollywood so far !

I don't like Bhai
I couldn&#39;t watch matrivumi It was way too much painful to watch

One of the first movies that was recommended to me when I started watching Bollywood movies was Chandni Bar. After most of the happy-go-lucky movies I&#39;d seen from this industry, it was a hard watch. Especially the part where her uncle rapes her. And then continues to treat her like his niece, as though nothing had happened. It was horrifying because she had to continue to live with her rapist, who was also her uncle only because of lack of money.

Bandit Queen should be no. 1 in this list... Imagine how phoolan devi faced all that in reality

Matrabhoomi is actually very much hard to watch...  But it&#39;s the bare truth...

Lodhha..

Colombo ma aya bhoot india ki maaki chut
Based on true story movies, the  horrifying oneMathrabhoomi seriously it&#39;s unbearable, it&#39;s curse to be born as female, am sorry saying out of depression and fear

Matrubhumi movie

Didnt found Bandit Queen in Ur List

Nice review....well researched

Sholey remake was very hard to watch

Raman Raghav 2.0 is a masterpiece. As usual awesome video dude keep it up !

Hey....you have some really good mindful content unlike other shitty bollywood news.......the other disturbing film i would like to mention is &quot;laxmi&quot; by monali thakur.....the trailor itself is soo disturbing that i didnt watch the movie.....i was expecting that one in your list unless i an wrong.....

I have watched Matrabhoomi but still it sends chill down my spine... To watch movie like this it needs courage and I got to know after watching it... One of most disturbing scene was when she was pregnant and put in I don&#39;t know what kind of place but still those bloody men didn&#39;t stop... It was terrible... I just cried after watching it kind of felt like depressed...

I feel like puking just by listening. I would definitely have puked if i had watched any of these.

Hey english back in hindi
Soty2 hard to watch

Please share the link with me...
That is crucial to watch but bitter truth of society

Randgyachya DEEPA
I have watched all of these movies...and these were far ahead of the current era of bollywood.

Watching the full movie PIHU deserves a bravery award.

Hey cutie ! 💜
If you have not seen Hostel series by Tarantino you have seen nothing

The Laxmi

I totally agree with thumbnail one

You have a nice voice

Udhata panjab 🤣😂🤣Bhai tu pahile critic ka course karle
I think you should watch crime patrol then ..

bkwas clip

These are the movies where you can see the acting level &amp; the reality about society ( which we can&#39;t handle ) Bhai tu Salman fan hai tu usike movies dekh .. ye aab Tere bass ki nahi 🤣

Awful Movie list and hates to see the disturbing scenes because it makes me respect humanity lesser than ever Awful awful awful Director&#39;s !!!!!

.. Blue picture blue picture
Murder 2... The scene where the girl pees

Jammy you are just love. 🥰♥️man loved it . The crispy voice

U r voice is so good and soothing

Keep criticizing sexually explicit films. And keep using those same sex clips to increase your viewership. Hypocrite

Matrabhoomi was abosuletly horrifying to watch 😐

R u hesitate to speak in Hindi?....hindi m h he Bollywood movies....think twice...

What about ugly, it should also be included...

Plz make a video on Kannada Movies

I am still stunned to know about these movie, I will not dare watch any of those. It&#39;s disturbing for rest of my life.

ThUgs Of Hindustan WaZ Hard to Watch Aswell...🙄

Murder 2

love the comments!

UGLY has perhaps most shocking end in the history of Hindi Cinema.

Even zero was hard to watch

Why on my recommendation 😥😥😓😓😭😤
Dhoom3 ...thugs...race3...krishh3....... usually most big budget Bollywood movies make me mortified after watching them😂😂😂

And Nawazbhai says this is nothing much the reality more absurd than what they show in movies

How come Anurag Kashyap&#39;s Ugly isn&#39;t on the list??  That ending gave me nightmares for days.

Shootout at wadla Haksar brothers killing yakaub

Watch NH 10..

U forget to mention the famous movie Bandit Queen. Some scenes feels Pretty disgusting to watch.

U missed movie Ugly.. it was perfect for its title

Yes

Nude scence are needed in Bollywood.

after sandeep maheshwari, this channel has no clickbaits

If you have guts then watch Urf Professor

I will add lakshmi movie to this category

what abt &quot;Sanju&quot; the toilet scene ..it really takes guts to show that man

There is a scene in Mardaani also..


If these you find hard to watch.....go try watching wrong turn or hostel series.....

Girl in yellow boots.

bakwas  video banana band kar.

Seriously guys put the damn scene instead of explaining,you talking doesn&#39;t generate much interest

Wow.. I dont know the actor&#39;s name (other than rahul bose) but he played a gay man in made in heaven too, right.. (and also played rahul gandhi in Accidental Prime Minister, just saying) 😅

Jab herry met sejal also hard to watch

<b>Although I am curious, I don&#39;t think I want to watch it.....</b>

You missed Race-3 and thugs of Hindustan....it was very hard and disturbing to watch

Raman raghav had some of the best actors and movie is really good if you are habited to whatch psychotic movies totally recommend

Udta punjab was ok. Scenes from bandit queen are hard to watch.

Shakti movie starring Karishma Kapoor and Newyork starring Katrina Kaif Neil Nitin Mukesh and John were difficult to watch.

Matrubhumi is really a shocking movie for me. I can&#39;t hold my tears whenever I watch this movie. Tulip done a great job in this movie. It&#39;s a mile stone movie I think. My grand salute to the director who made this kind of social movie. Everybody should watch this movie.

u missed Lajja...even thts a difficult movie to watch

Thugs of hindustan was very hard to watch, especially when u buy tickets for 300 ₹

How can you forget the movie Lakshmi. Absolutely disgusting and cringe worthy scenes. Too much to stomach for anybody

Baar baar dekho was also hard to watch because it was so boring...

You must watch the movie &quot;Laxmi&quot;

matrabhoomi was really hard to watch...Just after father in law I couldn&#39;t watch anymore..

Laxmi was also very difficult to watch

For me, one of the most disturbing scenes is from the movie Lajja where the character of Rekha gets &quot;punished&quot; for the intercaste marriage of his son. What&#39;s even more ruthless is the fact that it is based on a true event.

Where is Bandit Queen?

Ugly and Titli missing in the list

Tees mar Khan was also very hard to watch....

As u mention some movie scenes like matrabhumi,i am, and all r difficult to watch bt think abt d people who r victims of such unbearable incidents.

Really like ur all content... No bull shit No drama No masala.

Matrabhoomi is a fucking classic. Y&#39;all need to give it a watch. Harrowing, disturbing, and extremely thought provoking. That was good cinema.

I have no issues watching all these scenes. They were great, we need more cinema like this so people can get some idea what goes on in india

I am sad to see that actors like Salman Khan / Katrina Kaif /Sonam Kapoor are appreciated over actors like Kalki / Konkona Sen / Rahul Bose / Nawazuddin Siddiqi. We can complain all we want about Bollywood dealing more with masala entertainers and commercial films, but it is we who make them commercial. These great actors do not get their due credit. I have personally decided to purchase the ticket for any movie made by the &quot;good&quot; actors and great films. Even if I don&#39;t find the time to watch them. Just to lend them my support.

These movies are hard to watch coz they r close to reality... and these things happens to ppl in real life..... when u think about those ppl who have suffered and who r still going through such situations in their life ... just gives u shudders..... ... may God give happy and healthy life to every1 and keeps them away from such horrible situations....

Thugs was  so hard to watch

I watched bandit queen in the theater. After that I could not sleep for 2 to 3 nights, I was so shaken.

why won&#39;t feminists help them??!

Prem ratan dhan payo
What happened to Karishma kapoor in shakti movie was really hard to watch.

Bollywood itself is so disturbing to watch

<a href=""> hello friends I started my channel so please support it , its a request

Bro I think u shld put links of movies on whch u make videos..... So dat v can get em easily.....

Oh god dint know evn. Movies like matribhumi exists

Last scene of  movie ugly was really sad n disturbing.

This is reality of our society.....think about those who went through all these trauma n harrassment in real.

Richa chadda and mishra scene in gangs of wasseypur

Dushman was also such movie....great acting by ashutosh rana...

I saw a movie scene couldn&#39;t remember its name .. was a horror one which amitab saw in a mirror a man and told his friend and he couldn&#39;t watch it .. swear to god although that was simple scene but I couldn&#39;t sleep at that moment so intense

There’s another movie by the name “what will people say”. I guess not an Indian movie... I just remember I had to skip scenes coz it was getting really difficult to watch the situation shown there.

All salman khan movies hard to watch

You missed Rakhi and Deepak kalal in the list

Where&#39;s hostel&#39;s rape scene of the student ?

Please don&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t include NH-10 movie&#39;s Honor Killing on scenes that had huge amount of violence.

U can watch &quot;Laxmi&quot; also, shatish kosik was actor in this film..It was very good and too much hard to watch

Matrbhoomi is very very hard to watch ...

Hey dude, try putting actual moving scenes in your videos about the scenes.

What about mai prem ki deewani hoon. Extremely hard to watch man!

Any movie of Shahrukh Khan is hard to watch.

your voice is humble otherwise in many videos youtubers voice is so distrurbing bt as compare to you ur voice is good n i love to listen u🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Race3 and toh

Karthi and priyamanis national award winning movie ... watch the climax and report back to me

You missed table number 21

Good presentation skill bro.
Ur voice s sooooo seductive.....god I watch Ur vedio just listen u say .....wow voice

All those people are shame on humanity. They are demons in form of humans

Star kids who chose not to do movie

Actors who paid to get roles

List of underrated music composers

You can do list of male and female actors who are top and couldn&#39;t justify their role

&quot;Thugs of Hindustan&quot; should be on top of the list

Why pronounce Raman&quot;aa&quot; when you know it and pronounce Raman

You forget Aamir&#39;s Dhobi Ghat  it&#39;s also hard to watch. Is movie ko jitna bhi dekha usk baad to Aamir Khan se nafrat ho Gayi.

Another Tulip Joshi movie Dhokha should&#39;ve been in the list. Watch Anupam Kher, Ashutosh Rana and Tulip Joshi in the scene where Ashutosh Rana Abuse Tulip Joshi in front of her helpless father Anupam Kher and her brother. This scene made me feel what effect disturbing scenes may have in one&#39;s mind.

Krk orgasm scene in Deshdrohi when he is hit by bullet is way  hard to watch

Didn&#39;t know Page 3 was about pedophilia ring. I always ignored the movie as a kid when it would play on TV thinking it would be about something stupid like love and or fashion.

Ending scene of movie baabarr

You forgot to add fatima&#39;s fight scenes from thugs of hindostan

interesting fact: sushant shigh rajput was in the movie matrubhumijust fount out!!

Gangajal aankh dikhata hai madarjaat is also hard to watch.

These movies show real face of Indian culture

Currently i would say i thought of going to pihu but couldn&#39;t, that movie with that little girl talking to dead bodies in movie was way to difficult for me to watch.

Your video starting pic( I forgot    what actually we can it) is from the movie mathrabhoomi-A nation without a women, everyone should watch that movie it&#39;s amazing.

Dolly&#39;s (Kareena)  murder in Omkara is also hard to digest . your heart forgets to beat .

U r so cute
Thugs is also hard to watch😂😂

Watch movie Ghantaghar.. You will puke

Exam is coming. Kaise parhe taaki always remember... Watch this video and understand...
I found aakrosh hard to watch during the village burning scene when the goondas killed jhimilis son

Oh omg

&#39;Bawandar&#39;, &#39;Thanks maa&#39; &amp; &#39;Bandit queen&#39; should be mentioned

Watch AllBala&#39;s movies You&#39;ll find his movies more disturbing than ever

i think hamshakal movie and himmatwala (2013) was the wrost ever movie i had watch in my entire life. really those are toughest to watch.

i think salman khan&#39;s dance and action scenes from the movie dabang and dabang 2 are really funny and also very difficult to watch. and if salman starts dancing no one can stop me to leave the movie. even i think i was single person in the world who scape from the theater during 1/3 part  of movie tubelight is playing.

Get treated by an ent dude.u have an irritating voice ..

Omg literally it&#39;s unbearable.

15 Park Avenue ???

Thugs of Hindustan is hard to watch as well..

And Thugs of Hindustan ...

Nawazuddin is a god of acting

All of Bollywood is disturbing nowIt&#39;s all vile and sados and even the big so called stars are full of shitBollywood is an embarrassment now

I ve watched the movie matrubhoomi.....It&#39;s really disgusting the way the girl is treated.....And also it&#39;s shows the reality which is still going on ....

anyone who says alia bhatt is just a untalented starkid should watch udta punjab because not many actresses could do what she did so amazingly

Thugs of Hindustan also hard to watch

As long as there is cinema in India, people will have no power.
Sorry all bollywood movies are hard to watch for me.

Salman Khan films are hard to watch

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS. I&#39;M GONNA WATCH ALL OF THESE

matrubhumi maybe was not true.

U just read Wikipedia for Omar

i could not watch raman raghav 2.....................it was ugliest when sister out of frustration............offer her seil for sex to her brother and takes off her shirt.........................omg what the hell damn damn damn...............i stopped the movie

Matrubhumi really very hard n harsh to watch n it is very disturbing to c

Where could I watch matroobhumi online?

This guy tried&amp;refusedproductions never going to criticize the shitty and overacted movies of SRK like OSO, HNY, Chennai Express, Ra one, Fan, MNIK, Dilwale, RNBJ, JTHJ and many more, they are really hard to watch.. One Suggestion to the people of this channel &quot;don&#39;t be soo biased that people have to acknowledge this publically&quot;

It&#39;s pronounced as o-maar, not o-mar.

How can u forget laxmi

Ba pass
Tees maar khan ending part
Bad video non of ur claim had any video clips supporting ur rhetoric

U right the total extremely hard to watch but this r the dark truths of the Indian so iety

Shahrukh n rani ki paheli was also very hard to watch

You forgot bandit queen
Bhai use a little bit of Hindi plzzMujh apk video achchi lgt h
Just watch &quot;the dreamers&quot;, &quot;Ma Mere&quot;, &quot;Spanking the monkey&quot; &quot;Close my eyes&quot; and &quot;Geminis&quot; then you will let to know what is disturbing movie

Heyy why don&#39;t you come one on one with your audience..we need to see you and how u go about finding content and stuff like that

Nice work. I am going to watch these movies soon, they seem to have a strong impact and understanding.

thugs of hindustan is hard to watch.

Emran haamis films are hard to watch

Raman raghav was highly overrated because of idiots like you !

nawazuddin siddiqi always gives off an ashutosh rana vibe. Brilliant actor

Salman Khan show big boss is also hard to watch ,there is nothing in that show that is positive .....

RIP  courage! If movies are hard to watch imagine the plight of people who go through it and imagine the plight of people who are witnessing these victim&#39;s pain in order to heal them. These scenes in the movies are difficult to watch yes but how about learning something from them and collectively fight the social evils n the menace ?

An escape from afghanistan too manisha koirala’s movie

I can see the amount of effort you take to make these videos. Amazing job man!!!

1)Bandit queen 2)khatta mutha with akki’s sister

U just made mesosick

Some scenes from the movie &quot;Children of war&quot; are really disturbing to see...(the movie is highly recommended)

nawaz best
Deepa Mehta&#39;s film water....Should be on the list

Thankyou . Now I have a list of good movies to watch for the month . ✌️💕

Page3 and life in a metro must watch movies

Hey listen to his voice when he says film name of I am

Love Sex aur Dhokha directed by Dibakar Banerjee. The scene where a boy and his girlfriend were killed for inter caste marriage

Don&#39;t know whether I should like the compilation.. but then Bandit Queen was also disturbing and I couldn&#39;t sit through Raman Raghav coz it was scary

You need to make another video on the same topic to include difficult scenes from Chandana Bar, Bhawandar and Ugly to name a few.

make video on worst and best result of nepotism

For a moment i thought it was shirish kunders pic

For me Sangarsh was one of the most scariest movie

These are reality......

Raman Raghav 2.0 basically was a movie that people should hate, if you hate the movie that means it&#39;s a great movie....

The reason why Tried and Refused Productions is better than Triggered Insaan. Because of its sophistication and better tastes and in general much more refined understanding of what cinema is all about. Great video.

This also includes cruel rape scene from premgrantha.

Can anyone explain what was hard to watch in scene 3 (Page 3). I am unable to understand.

your english is good.you should start an english teaching channel.

This channel is in my binge watch list now. Great insights man.

Lakhsmi is also too hard to watch

Ghajini, lipstick under my burkha...
Yamla started looking crazy again!! 😰😵😧😬😱😡 Trailer makes me cringe
Maatrabhoomi was disturbing and stayed with me for a long time where every one is raping the lead actress repeated in the stable.sridevi produced movie.Raman ragvan was definitely scary to watch.Udta Punjab with alia scene was again wtf...Page 3 was disturbing with the scene mentioned and makes you think these things actually is going on.I am movie not watched.

Badlapur was also a very disturbing one specially when varun dhavan kills radhika apte nd her husband

Murder 2 ?? It should be the number 1 hard to watch movie. Gay man killing women. Ugggggh that movie is beyond disturbing and disgusting.

Except mathrubhumi nothing is disturbing at all. I hope You haven&#39;t seen any disturbing Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam movies. Not even one I guess

Movie Nasha has such scenes

matrabhumi is gut wrenching ive seen it

ever thing was going well until the 1st one.

Make a video on best movies which become flop in theaters

Realty is more hard to watch

I would have never come across matrubhoomi , if I hadn&#39;t watched this video. Thank you so much. It was great.

I have seen most of it.And I must those are some really tough scenes to <a href="">watch.You</a> could have bandit Queen&#39;s Seema Biswas getting raped by whole village to this list.That was almost <a href="">unbearable.It</a> was like reality was being shoved down your throat.

Good work :) as always.... But u should have mentioned Rajeev  Khandelwal starer Amir  too...

RGV ki Aag should be in list

U missed B.A pass

Reshma death scene from murder 2

I don&#39;t know why people think nawaz uddin siddikee is a great actor he is doing same roles since gowp till s.g what&#39;s the difference in all his movie he is a illiterate f***er in his all movies

Raman Raghav was Good but after watching i got distubed after watching

hey jammy, is &#39;I AM&#39; available for free on hotstar? or is it for premium members only?

How could you miss UGLY...the ugliest movie that i watched

You&#39;ve no idea what an ordeal it was to watch <b>Main prem ki diwaani Hun</b>   &amp; that too in a theatre.😪

You missed Humsakals ,the entire movie was a horror

son of english
Ghajini murder scene was really disturbing to watch. Still in my brain after all these years

I actually turned off my laptop when that scene in Raman raghav came. I really couldn&#39;t sit through it.

Lakshmi is  one of the great movie that i have watched

Now 377 is nomore so no problem

Your voice is amazing and video too... love u 😘

Jammy Pants seems to find a perverse pleasure in dissecting such unsavory sequences

There was a movie in which Tabu told her husband he has raped her many times. Can anyone tell me the name

You missed Un-freedom. It was pretty much banned in India, but you can still find some copies on the internet. It dealt with subjects like Communism and Homosexuality. What makes it unbearable is when a father orders his daughter to be raped right. IN. FRONT. OF. HIS. EYES. by his colleagues.Ewww.

Nargis fakhri acting is hard to watch for me.😖😵🤧😷🤕
Most hard to watch is  The Wrong Turn series..ever..

Heyy What about Mardaani???It&#39;s so difficult to watch thats movie

deshdrohi was unbearable from casting scene itself

There was an 80s movie. Meri Awaz Suno. It was poorly made but near the end, there was a scene where a 9 month pregnant Hemamalini (filmed when she actually was pregnant) gets pounded repeatedly in the belly to the point where she aborts and dies in front of her husband (Jitendra). That was absolutely gruesome.

Top 5 best action sequences in Bollywood

You didnt mention Bandit Queen&#39;s rape scene!

Jhoom brabar jhoom, race 3 ,hamshakal are also pretty hard to watch

Please do it in Hindi.... More subscribers will come or views also.
Nice

Bro start using some more Hindi in your videos,you speak good Hindi

After watching this video I decided to watch matrubhoomi and It is the most disturbing movie I have ever watched.

Tera bakvas video that extremely hard to watch

I am so uncomfortable after watching this video yaar

Matrabhoomi and Raman raghav scenes have been mentioned already in other video.

Udta Panjab Is Really Disterbung
Reading the comments I think to be justified to all these kind of astonishing movies to still got to highlight multiple such movies that means you have to make some more parts on this topic.

I think you miss gajni

<b>Humshakals</b> was pretty hard to watch TBH...

Just watched Matrubhoomi ... It was painful and suffocating as hell

Where will you get some t-shirt friend?
Judwaa was extremely hard and disturbing....

Gosh , you missed movie called &quot;Lakshmi&quot; . It&#39;s chilling and so disturbing.

You should make video on indian best short movies......

Gangs of Wasseypur - Ramadheer&#39;s death.

Awesome contents and totally new...

Awesome video

Thanks for making the video on my suggestion

RR 2.0 was really difficult to watch and bone chilling.

Himesh Reshmiya&#39;s movies are hard to watch too.

Matrubhoomi is the combination of two real stories India........So, 100% movie is truth based

Fuck Bollywood

Jemmy ....you forgot to mention thanks maa....the climax scene of that movie was unbearable....

There is no need to copy old songs or add sex scenes in Bollywood.
Some scenes from -Titli-Masan-Thanks ma (Climax) Definitely deserve a spot or a honorable mention.

A video on actresses rubbishy makeovers that still didnt do anything for them; ameesha patel in lazy lamhe, kim sharma in all films, rimi sen in dhoom and kajols sister in neal and nikki i dnt even kno her name 😭😂😂

To be honest I really enjoyed ur videos

My God! Hard hitting.
You forgot Judwaa 2
Usko Raman bolte hai bhai.. Ramana nai.. English..🤣🤣
I feel like I&#39;ve seen this video long before. But according to dates its new... ( deja vu

Does Shashi Tharoor write your script?

Change that sound...in the beginning!!!!

377k subscribers 😜

they were brilliant scenes that gets stuck in ur head.. forever

Not such a good video ,,, according to ur standards ... We were not clear that exactly what u were trying to say ...

Bsdk has become very good in india.
NH 1OUgly No smoking

Again ill pronunciations of hindi names and words. Young these days think pronouncing hindi words in english accent is new cool.

Can you please please please please make a video on Sacred games

Alia is so talented !

Matrbhoomi, omg, didn&#39;t knew a movie like that exists. And a disgusting culture like that! Don&#39;t have the spine though to watch that.

The Bombay blast scene from Black Friday.

You forgot every salman khan movie ever made.
I mean more videos about it... You have done one yet I&#39;ve seen it....

Plz make a video about some psychological movies....

I like the music when video is starts...

U missed bandit queen
<a href="">2:35</a> &quot;Not knowing where the kids are situated&quot;Wow. English.

Alia Bhatt in Udta Punjab looks like first girlfriend of CJ in GTA San Andreas 😂

Add bandit queen, where phoolen is raped by an entire village. That&#39;s the most disgusting/disturbing scene I&#39;ve ever seen.

U missed kalyug... so disturbing.
I was expecting Lipstick Under my Burkha to be on this list due to the marital rape scenes of Konkona in the movie

Bandit Queen....the entire movie is difficult to watch

5 movies that could have been better

Should have also added the movie &#39;trapped&#39; to your list above. Rajkumar Rao has acted so well in the movie that some of the scenes make you feel equally helpless and make you cringe and whine! Do watch it and consider.

I too felt the same with these movies. Whenever I switch on tv and these scenes come up, I somehow switch the channel till its gone. Its truly disturbing.

This channel deserves more then million subscribers , it&#39;s not only about entertainment but also take us to the best side and works that has been done by our people . Many of us just pretend themselves as only hollywood viewers coz india do not not make good films , dude u just have to follow this guy&#39;s channel .

Dude,it&#39;s 5 Shocking <b>Bollywood</b> Movie Scenes Extremely Hard To Watch

You missed out 1947 Earth- the scene where a man was dragged out of his house, legs tied to two jeeps and pulled.. The violence &amp; horror of the Partition in the movie  is extreme

You forgot Bandit Queen. Hope you have seen the film

Hello JammyPants!You know what else is ignored in thd Bollywood? These films do not get enough credit, accolades or nominations for the actors and directors. Sad

U alwys ask for video ideas bt god damn u urslf have so many mind blowing ideas i must say i am in love with u man ❤❤

Jammy today I finished sacred games. Literally screamed in every murder. I&#39;m shaking and those chutiya mc bc is coming in every sentence. I want some light movie to forget those murders 😣😣😣😣

End of raman rhagav 2.O is worst than I think

You missed murder 2.....
You r awesome

In parched climax scene when radhika apte&#39;s character is brutly beaten by her husband is also very Tough to watch

98% of the Bollywood is delusional!! And rest 2% , well you can see on this video!!

Bandit Queen should have been in the list too👍

This is one no-nonsense channel. Great work, keep it up. By the way, congratulations for the 377K subscribers 😁😁

totally agree with  Matrabhoomi..I watched that movie 4-5 years ago but I still cant come out of it. Tulip Joshi has done a amazing work in that movie.

You missed Lakshmi movie by Nagesh Kukunoor
I actually expected Agneepath

I Am not Am I

I think Gajni should have been listed in this video

Judwaa 2 was extremely hard to watch

377 k subscriber...what a coincidence...

Before watching ur videos... I GIVE A BIG THUMPS UP.... U R FABULOUS...

Oh man! I am already feeling a bit uneasy

Murder 2 was also very violent and disturbing.

correct 👍
U forgot to mention bandit queen, unfreedom and BA paas

A very good list.....but I must say u missed a few.....children of war is one movie which is terrifying to watch....the scene in which tilotima shome z gangraped and then mercilessly murdered plus a scene in which women are thrown from the truck , stripped,half of them are kept for raping and the othert half z brutally murdered was the hardest thing I have seen

What about the movieMasaan???

I am is censored on hotstar 😐

Ur so cute
Unfreedom????

King of exaggeration and superlatives

was having chat with a friend. he says women are turning men and men into women. example of men turning into women , this channel&#39;s narrator I am reminded of

Salman Khan movies like Race 3, PRDP and Bodyguard was also hard to watch

These  films are supposed to be respected more than the garbage stuffs of Salman, srk and all the newcomers

nice😀

Tubelight was hard to watch, kyu k tube kharab tha

These movies are really disturbing...

You spoke about the Raman Raghav disturbing scene in another video too. Why repeated content?? Do you need some ideas??

That is sick really

Either you forgot or you haven&#39;t seen the scenes of Om Puri and MALLIKA Sharawat from THE DIRTY POLITICS! 😣

Anurag kashyap can really bring out.. true actor... From any individual... Great director..

I guess the scene from Bandit queen is also unbearable, where she is raped by several men after her capture.

Badlapur sequence as well

Please mention it as only bollywood or like this indian movies(bollywood).. if u mention indian films then must include movies from all languages

Gangs of Wasseypur&#39;s scene When Faisal&#39;s mother (Richa Chadha) was about to have sex with his uncle

If you watched &quot;Sairat&quot; then watching &quot;Dhadak&quot; is hard and disturbing to watch...!!!

According to Genetics male female ratio should be 1:1 when the ratio goes bad things like this (matribhumi) happen.

Omerta ??

It&#39;s always a treat to listen to your amazing Bollywood analysis...im a fan of your mind boggling vocabulary 😍

<a href="">#MATRUBHOOMI</a> 😟

Irfan Khan and Priyanka Chopra&#39;s lovemaking scenes in 7 Khoon Maaf was most disturbing to watch. Oh God it was so uncomfortable.

That is one of my videos tumbnail. Indeed good work.

My heart has come to see the true Matrabhoomi, my heart is full of joy and I have seen it.
Haryana's log is marching
<b>All Kanti Shah movies are unbearable</b>

Again alia bhatt among great actors...I think this youtube is her fan...Totally biased...

Mohenjo Daro was so hard to watch.... I didn’t even watch it.

What a list ☝👌👌👌You should be a full time film critic🤘

Fiction is hard to watch fact is unbearable, unbelievable, unethical, heartshattering and I don&#39;t know what words describe the way one should feel after watching news nowadays..

You should experiment on the way of delivery of dailoges and the presentation of the listIts been a long time and i am kind of bored and feel like its the same content repeating although its not !

What about those movies which are also hard to watch like race 3, Ram Gopal Verma ki Aag,etc etc 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Thanks bro you always gives me movie goals...this time is matrbhumi and i am... others were already watched

I would have thought Jaago would have been mention. I saw that movie once on tv. And I found that child gang rape scene extremely hard to watch. And then I found out later that movie was based on a true real life incident. Made me regret of ever taping that movie. But after that one time of seeing the movie. I decided never to watch that movie again.

Include LOVE Sonia

Katrina Kaif &#39;S all movies are hard to watch.

Make a video on brilliant writer

Make a video on most amazing bollywood  comedy movies of all time please... my favorite is dhamaal😊

The hardest seen to watch was krk fake orgasm seen after shot by bullet in the movie desdrohi..

Your content is really perfect. Nice work!

You forgot movie New York... it was really hard for me to watch the scene when john was in jail after 9/11

Married with a kid LOL

Well most of Salman Khan&#39;s movies are unbearable to watch.

Love your channel because it&#39;s so much accurate all the time!

Ever heard of unfreedom?

Subscribed Ur channel bro
I am was really disturbing as it was a crime to be gay.. But after SC verdict on 6th September 2018 it&#39;s not punishable crime now.. Police can charge them of hvin sex in public.. Just as normal heterosexual ppl.

Pls make a video on movies like oldboy (2003)

Even your subscribers are 377.......k

Brilliant ! And you should have added Omerta movie, where Omar cuts the journalist&#39;s throat

Btw what&#39;s the track you play in the intro???

You missed some scenes from Ugly movie and Raman Raghav is one of the best Psychological thrillers

The final 15 minutes of Parinda... That was damn haunting (Not disgusting). Many sequences from the attack of 26/11..

Jammy bro I watched Raman Raghav 2.0 after watching your previous video on it .. and damn yar it really is good 🙈..I mean it&#39;s creepy but still awesome .. but it&#39;s underrated 💔

Varun all moives are hard to watch
