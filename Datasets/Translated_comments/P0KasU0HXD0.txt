I’m in krish’s position. I’m a girl. My father is being unreasonable. I feel so lost

Missing You Bunny
For men it&#39;s more of job marketing,as for Sunsilk for women.

Just rediscovered this absolute piece of gem and also my childhood.

This shows that girls dont care , they will forget you no matter how old your relationship is , nothing matter for them 

It&#39;s December 2023 still in love with this song

Quality movie

I am bihari and my boyfriend is manipuri please bless us guys

By singing a few, a few songs, they define the situation and are bosses 
Me and my girl friend(now my wife) were in same situation at this time so when ever i watch this song tears come in my eyes specially at <a href="">3:50</a> , but all well thats end well same like the movie :) god bless everyone

A few songs are composed like this, so that they become famous later and then come situation wise ️
What a song, if any one want to suggest song with this vibe please suggest me.

Pen, paper, and loneliness.

Yar download Vali b do na

Who is listening buddy?

gem ️
Mba in  finance weds Mba  in Marketing 
prep with this song for the shooting location of this movie is best combo for quants and music...

Nobody will read this ik. Its been many years since 2 States released. I have been a big fan of it and somehow my life turned out to be like this in a different way. My childhood friend loves me since childhood and so do I. It&#39;s been almost a decade. But we can&#39;t be together due to family differences. I keep relating to this song. I don&#39;t know how can I support him through this because first and foremost he&#39;s my friend. I&#39;ll not have any happy ending like this movie I know. I just come around to see them happy and maybe read some happy comments from real people who found their happy ending.

i was always soo insecure about me that I always used to tell him that he deserve someone wayyyy better than me .I still remember that day when  I broke down crying before him .And he gave me the best comfort nd   he even  sang  that &quot;kedi teri naraazgi ,gal sun leh raaz gi ,jism yeh kya hai , khookli seepi , rooh di moti hai tu  &quot; nd tere bina ooh mahiya din dariya rain jazeere lagde &quot;for me that day. He gave me that confidence  that I  still carry with me . I dont know  how long we are going to be together ...all I can do is to pray to have u forever .thank u ! Till today this song is something that give me peace .

&quot;Jism ye kya hain, khokhli sipi,Ruh the moti hain tu!&quot;Always gives me goosebumps 

Ishhhh
Im santhali n my boyfriend is gujarati his family likes me lot, I don&#39;t know how my family would react when I tell them about us. 

in 2023

Just no offence to Arijit singh but deep down i feel songs that are not sung by Arijit are the best because they are underrated....Arijit singh is so Overrated....

Power to all broken hearts power to all with incomplete love stories ️

Anyone in September 2023???

Favourite One 
Mai or meri life partner dono shadi karna chate hai same cast  hai even our my family not supporting me . We are in 2023 but families are living in 1980 era .

Peace
Come From munawar Faruqui &#39;s story ️
2023...... I was in class 11th when i Heard this still gem 

I wanna get rid of this what I am feeling right now. It&#39;s hurting like hell

Same condition with me now 

Originally a Bangla song and poetry. I guess Pritam and Amitava both are from Bengali heritage and culture.

Thsi is teh best song of this movie. Quite underarted sadly.

Loved the songs, Loved the film .......

bal

Not sure who enters in the meeting room like this and tell that boyfriend is here 

This is one of the most underrated performance by arjun kapoor

Adhuri story, adhura goodbye..Yuhi reh na jaye adhure sada Pratik our story can’t be over.. you’re my home  pls come back
Only lovers can feel this song specially after breakup.....

Wo rishte bohot Kam hote hain iss tarah success pate hain

Whenever I feel my love for you, I will be there for you 
I miss her.

Arjun Kapoor at this point is certainly a Chetan Bhagat&#39;s boy 

This song is simply beautiful yet hurtful at the same time

God save this song from Neha Kakkar 

This song randomly come in my playlist but it&#39;s awesome  love it

My sister is going through this phase nowadays just like this movie coz of boy&#39;s family . My sister is now Alia Bhatt and his fiancee as Arjun Kapoor  Movie name 2 castes as we are Bengali Brahmin and the boy is non Brahmin . She has kept a condition if her mother-in-law fully considers her as bahu then only she will keep relationship .

Adhuri adhuri stories…adhura goodbye….

My wife Arjun Kapoor.
I was 10 years old when I first listened to this song , now I&#39;m 19 and still in love with this movie and this song 

'Jism y kya h khokli seepi rooh da moti h tu'
2 states all songs are best 2023

So related me
Lyrics: There is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the cuckoo, there is no rain in my hand, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the gun in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the moon. Oh goodbye, this same rain will go forever, forever, goodbye, this same rain will go forever, forever goodbye, this same rain will go forever, moonlight to bars, then why should I put my hand here and not stop your anger, what is the secret of the sun's body, what is the pearl of the soul of your garage, how many times have you changed in my life. O mother, I am returning to you from all the scattered hearts.. my sister, my deeds, both the robbers have not taken the sun in the sky, there is no anger in the night in the cuckoo, there is no anger in the sky, then why have I taken my hand here and there, Adhoori Adhoori Adhoori story, Adhoora goodbye Yunhi raina jaaye adhoore sadaaAdhoori adhoori adhoori kahaani, adhoora goodbye Yunhi yunhi rain jaaye adhoore sadaa Na na na… na na na..Phir kyun mere haath adhere na lagde ne Tere.. oh mahiyaDan dariya, rain jazeere lagne ne
Chandaniya to barse ,fir kyu mere haath andhere lagde ne .. hattsoff Amitabh bhattacharya

Why this song makes me shed tears

Ishaqzaade &amp; 2 states After that we have lost Arjun Kapoor.

Even mast magan is a beautiful song ️

I remember when i was in long distance relationship with a girl from Hyderabad at that time this movie was released,i always tell her that this movie is made on us she was too genuine and loyal but destiny separated us.

Mast movie

While listening to this song and being surrounded by people, I am still wondering why things happened the way they did. Why I didn&#39;t saw that coming. Despite being spring season I wonder why April isn&#39;t blossoming in my arms. ;)

My favourite

people from now 1990-s will understand the situation of their childrens as they faced the situation

Reminds me 2014....struggle...for convincing my family for intercaste marriage.... Always g

That conversation b/w Krish &amp; Ananya on the terrace is the last conversation of almost every indian unsuccessful love story . That is where the story ends in reality.

Its almost 2 am midnight i am just thinking that ham mile hi kyu the jab hame milna hi nahi tha 

Adhuri adhuri adhuri story… adhura goodbye.. yuhi yuhi reh na jane adhure sada……

I got this breakup in IIM??????????????
Really most underrated song . Unbelievable lyrics must say

Leaving this comment here. Wanna see it here after 10 11 years

The only song which will remind me of her even after many years...miss those days...this song also justifies that in family caste issue is important rather then there children

Love ️️️️️️️️
To be honest I only liked one Arjun Kapoor’s  movie that is this...

Epic scene - in the fragrance of the flower market. Dew drops from pearl eyes spill

I just love this song. And whenever i turnned back to listen songs my only choice is this

When you miss someone so deeply and you know things would have been different if he/she was with you right now️

Amitabh Bhattacharya is just love .

Love it

The bgm is so matched with drake&#39;s -passionfruit

My love story right now is two continents, life is great.

I can relate this song...and my ex posted a picture with this song....he is like alia and Iam like arjun kapoor in this song...poor me!

Sometimes I forget, arjun kapoor was there in the film

this entire album speaks what music really is.....absolutely amazing!!!!

I miss you&lt;kimy
We either fall in love with someone or follow the path of a mad person, then we follow the path of an animal, our father has lost all the love from us, now we are no longer in love, now we are happy that we are loving ourselves a lot. Now you are the only one who has patience or courage ️
Today I feel this song from bottom of my heart ️

Kya song hai still favourite 
2017 - Pune - Heart broken by an IT girl - Listened to this, still feeling in 2017

criminally underrated song,i always feel that pain listening to this song.Adhuri kahani adhura alvida

The lyrics and music ... Uffff it&#39;s just brilliant man.

Reminding of delhi connought place

This song is too surreal to be forgotten, evergreen it is and so meaningful. &lt;3

This song is soooo underrated... And i am glad... Because if this song gets a lot of recognition then people will ruin it by using it on reels

Every single line every single beatGives me next level of satisfaction

Arjun is super lean in this he looks good

8 years of this legendary song and only legends are still listing

I am not feeling well  without you Plz help me

All you need is patience, hope she understands...

Going through same scenario hope good come to us‍️
from insta

Any one 2022 listen this song !! Beautifull song

Please dost?? BDRKedi teri naraazgiGal sun le raaz kiJism ye kya hai, khokhli seepiRooh da moti hai tu[You are my soul, will always be]

Tumhari mom mere family ko accept  nai kr payegi...i really felt that line...i lost my diamond...my mom never accepted her...and we broke up

Let&#39;s be honest alia looked amazing in every scene of this movie

To the love of my life.... Abhijit Panchal.....You are my forever n ever

I loved this movie to the extent that I started hating Amrita singh &#39;s role.I think it was her who made them separated.But ,finally they made it together ️️️️️️️️️️

I love this movie ️

Miss u . Wish u hd nvr cheated
This song is the perfect summary of those couples who are in  limitless sepration because of ego clashes &amp; family issue.

Listening to this song while travelling is like heaven

Arjun was love in this movie

I love this song from beginning 

Wow.   What a song by Mohan Kannan, the guy who sang  Laal Singh Chaddha title track!

Only movie where I love arjun Kapoor acting..

I have no words to express my feelings for this song

Arjun Kapoor has not even come to acting...
This hits harder for the peeps who have Loved and lost 

Such a beautiful piece. I cannot stop humming this.

Amitabh bhattacharya ️

Great acting by Aliya bhat

Shankar Mahadevan's line
In Bollywood many songs are underrated this gem is definitely one of them

There is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the cuckoo, there is no rain in the sky, why my hand is not there in the sky, there is no rain in the gun in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky. Goodbye, this same rain will go forever forever. Adhoori goodbye, this same rain will go forever. Oh, moonlight to rain. Why did I put my hand here? What is the secret of the sun's anger? What is the secret of the body of the sun? The soul is as small as you are in the garage, the change in my life is my support. O mother, I am singing from the scattered heart.. my sister, my deeds, both the robbers have laid down the light in the sky, there is no anger in the sky, there is no anger in the sky, there has been no rain, then why have I held my hand here and there, Adhoori Adhoori Adhoori story, Adhoora goodbye, Yunhi raina jaaye Adhoore SadaaAdhoori Adhoori A sad story, a sad goodbye, the same rain always comes, Na Na Na… Na Na Na… Then why did my hand hold on to you without you… O MahiyaDin Dariya, the rain made me laugh.
If you have search this masterpiece, then my friend &quot;You have good taste of Music&quot;ENJOY..... 

The way he said.. I will be barbad ho jaunga..
Still listening to this in 2022

Just love this song ️

Thank you people for keeping this song underrated, also the singer is gem..Mr Mohan kanan sir.. what a husky voice he has.

I didn&#39;t knew this was sung by mohan kanan sir..he is so flawless

Still keep coming back to this gem! 

Why relationships are soo complicated 

Too good

Life partners

Yes alias voice️like child
But I am scared to fall in love thats why I avoid being in amy relation

The only good movie of Arjun Kapoor.

Laal Singh Chaddha Song Sung By Mohan Kanan..
The story of my love is not different from Two States. Our marriage happened but story went further. We have not met for 4 and half years. We have a six years old daughter. Now She is adamant on giving me divorce and I am struggling so much. No body can understand me. Our families are against each other. I am struggling so much. I am in eternal pain. Just few days back I went to Chennai, she didn&#39;t even met me. I was there for 6 days and then came back to Delhi. Praying to her, her family and God. I don&#39;t want divorce. I am ready to do whatever she wants

From 2022 

I only read the book ,didn&#39;t watch movie but I can imagine Chetan and Anusa and their struggle to get along together ️️

I like that music but can anyone send me the English version of it ?

Nancy ️
In the era of Chand baliya i like chandaniya

This song is one of the most connected among all other from this movie it&#39;s just a remorse version.

This song lyrics only that person can understand who&#39;s luv someone  and get breakup

Because of your anger, the girl has taken away the secret…what is this body that has hidden, the soul has given you the love…️️️
Anyone listening this melody in 2022

I might sound wrong but I think Arjun acted better than alia in this movie, his expressions in specially the emotional scenes were really good... I really feel he should do emotional movies rather than comedies, his acting skills shine in emotional scenes...Edit: I didn&#39;t mean that Alia didn&#39;t act well! I just meant that Arjun did better than her in this movie. Anyways, this is <b>MY</b> opinion. I respect yours, you respect mine. Peace out

Ananya doesn&#39;t love krish more She is with Ranbir 

A

Extremely touchy  when the body is just going on, mentally and emotionally dead. P.S.: When you know you are 22, and that you&#39;ll never get committed.

Who is here after ranbir alia marriage? Some how I felt like watching this song now

Such an entertaining film!!

This scene is so similar to dear zindagi! It feels like Alia probably regrets her love for Arjun for whom she loved after 7 years!

Adhuri Kahani reh naa jaaye hits me badly
Song is awesome but look at the dialogue &amp; look at arjun&#39;s dialogue delivery 

Sankarmahadevan&#39;s masterpiece ️
In search of my Chris........Ananya️
Really awesome song  

We need to start mentioning singer, composer, lyricists names first before the actors as they deserve more credit for creating beautiful pieces like these.

Even in 2022 still can feel this song️️

dude this song is so underrated

I am sorry girl

Sometimes u r helpless of being in love and most of the time u fall n fail... doesn&#39;t means Ur Love failed but it&#39;s a lost n it&#39;s hit/hurt....with a smile u leave a life of lifetime

This song and film is so underrated.....it’s tooo beautiful

My favourite movie

After watching this movie, this song made me feel very happy️
Still gives goosebumps

When you give your heart to someone ,that person deals with you without heart and that hurts...

Heart touching song

What is this hollow body of the body? You are the pearl of the soul.
7 years!!!!!!!

Parents never understand the feeling of their children you both try to solve this problem keep contact with each other every thing will be fine

2/2/22

Right in the feels

I found this song today, I liked it. I don't understand the lyrics yet, I looked for a translation, I found this story from the movie and I identify with it a lot... Thank you, strangers, for reading my comment. Kindly...
One of my fav song ️

Chaandaniya toh barse phir q mere haath andhere lagde......heart touching line

14th February Valentines day listening to this song... Hopping things will turn out good in my life too. Bihar loves Punjab

This song is Outstanding

And now she is dating Krish&#39;s  cousin ranbeer kapoor

Such a relatable song️

The only film where I loved ARJUN KAPOOR ️

What is this body, a hollow seep?
Now we have the reason why Yes bank has failed miserably. :P

Beautiful song️
why is alia so cute ️
I think Every love story goes through this phase...This is real test of there relationship...

Bollywood doesn&#39;t make such osm movies anymore

I have suffered a lot my life
If our life were like movies and we had happy endings...

7

Really nice song

Yesterday this song was suggested by my gf and i heard it numerous tyms and this song full of emotions 

What is this body, you are the pearl of the soul...
Arjun and Alia look so nice together, But it is a surprise that they have not done any movie since the 2 States

This is my all time eternal song. The music and and lyrics just so beautiful.  A song that can help me feel music and emotions.Special place also goes to the picturisation of the song, so beautiful. 

I love this song ️

This movie would be more popular among Bangladeshis if Aishariya Rai was there instead of Alia Because Bangladeshi people does not recognize quality good language skills and ideals of a person as such Alia Vhat. The whole society would vote only Aishariya Rai for becoming an actress of &quot;the game play&quot; of the movie with no good language skill.

Brother, why don't you block this number? Will you block someone else?
Beautiful song 

Masterpiece

I don't feel like listening to the song after seeing the food of these two.
That smile on face of Alia @ 2.55..Is the real definition of true love..!!!

Hats Off To Shankar Ehsaan Loy &amp; Amitabh Bhattacharya to Sach a Masterpiece When 1 first Listened it , it&#39;s Bas Guitar Riff reminded me of Song &#39;Dil behelta hai mera, aapke aa jane se&#39; , But It&#39;s Totally Different

Probably the best role in Arjun Kapoor&#39;s whole career .

7 years and it&#39;s the best memory of my first love . Still refreshing 

3rd dec 2021 
Intro bass line
Hmm..alag hi vibe h is gaane ki

One of my favourite songs ️

Winner choose gara

Someone in 2021 ?

Mast magan and this song from 2 states are too soothing ️️

In the night with someone&#39;s memory it hit hard everytime ️

Current condition of my life... love marriage mei jb family involve hoti hn to ldka Or ldki ko bhut suffer krna pdta hai...i hope sb man jaye

This amazing song has really touched my heart ️️️

Fantastic and song magnificent lyrics and wonderfuly sang ️️️

Adhuri hai Kahani..Adhura Alveeda..!!!I don&#39;t how many people can relate to this but many of us have such a relationship which never got the closure which we deserve..!!!I really hope one day at least for one day we all get chance to spend time with our partner who left us without saying anything..Without explaining anything..We surely don&#39;t deserve this..Instead of loving so much one day they will leave..1000s of questions.. But only one answer SILENCE

Kya gana Hai...in Loop more than 35 times..kuch to baat Hai...chaandaniya.. phir kyu mere haath andhere lagate Hain.. it&#39;s just too Good.. Thank You for writing such soulful words..and flawless singing and soothing music..Tere bina oo mahiya din dariyaa.. Raain Jazere lagde ne..

Only for those whose judged alia bhat so much after shaandar.....

Hollywood doesn&#39;t knows that bollywood has this legend pieces are 100× bigger then albums of Hollywood ....

so nice cute beautiful  song
There is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the cuckoo, there is no rain in the sky, why my hand is not there in the sky, there is no rain in the gun in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky. Goodbye, this same rain will go forever forever. Adhoori goodbye, this same rain will go forever. Oh, moonlight to rain. Why did I put my hand here? What is the secret of the sun's anger? What is the secret of the body of the sun? The soul is as small as you are in the garage, the change in my life is my support. O mother, I am singing from the scattered heart.. my sister, my deeds, both the robbers have laid down the light in the sky, there is no anger in the sky, there is no anger in the sky, there has been no rain, then why have I held my hand here and there, Adhoori Adhoori Adhoori story, Adhoora goodbye, Yunhi raina jaaye Adhoore SadaaAdhoori Adhoori adhoori kahaani, adhoora alvidaYunhi raina jaaye adhoore sadaaNa na na... na na na..Phir kyun mere haath adhere lagde neTere bina.. o mahiyaDin dariya, rain jazeere lagde neSimilar Songs With Lyrics￼Sawaar LoonBy Monali ThakurView Lyrics￼NainaBy Amaal MallikView Lyrics￼OffoBy Aditi Singh SharmaView Lyrics￼Mera Mann Kehne LagaBy Falak ShabirView LyricsManmarziyanBy Shilpa RaoView LyricsGehra IshqBy Shekhar RavjianiView LyricsJiya Lage NaBy Sona MohapatraView LyricsDesi RomanceBy PritamView LyricsAmbarsariyaBy Sona MohapatraView LyricsDarmiyaanBy Shafqat Amanat AliView LyricsGaana&gt;Hindi Songs&gt;Chaandaniya&gt;Chaandaniya LyricsDownload the Gaana app 4.5 (100M+ downloads)Use coupon code 'GPLUS2MONTHS'to get free Gaana Plus subscription for 2 months

the story of this song is very true and families always comes between the ture lovers

Cute

If you&#39;re happy you enjoy this songIf you&#39;re sad you feel this song. 

Oh Mahiya, without you, the river rains like rain.
Everyday before getting up from bed I listen this song.... It completes my day.,. ️️

One of the most underrated song...

Hatts off to all song composers.. lyricist..all.. ️..ye song directly dil ko touch krta hai... 

2021

&quot;What is this hollow sip of the body, you are the pearl of the soul&quot;.... Oh my friend, what have you written....
Some songs are made to be immortal !!!

This song is just a master piece ️ Anyone here in 2021???

What a masterpiece is this song.....

Everytime I listen this and I get goosebumps

This song for my jaan .. Preeti...  When she say no to me for marriage in our 3 years relationship...

Adhura albida
Yeh kya haal bana raka hai.she knows the but 

It&#39;s been 7 years , but it still fresh and soothing song of mine 

<a href="">2:26</a> JISM Ye kya h khokli sipi..Ruh da moti h tu  Fav 
True.

Par saja to mujhe mil rhi na...this line hits me ️️️️
I married someone outside my community. Everyone was against it. We too had a moment like this before we got married. But I was so crazy in love that I accepted the SH!T he said as a lover&#39;s quarrel. I practically forced my folks to accept him and his family. 10 years I went through the marriage in the name of love. The funny thing is, all this was after I read the book 2 States. Even when I saw this scene while I was still being abused, it didn&#39;t hit me that I was in denial. Love makes you blind, deaf and dumb.

September 2021 and this song is still lit

This song for heart broken men.  Who can&#39;t  express but still silently love her whole heartedly but pain is killing him silently.

She is muslim and i am Hindu and right now both of us hear this song ...hope our family give support

Some songs are never getting old still evergreen

ye song sun ky mery golden years 2013, 2014 shiddat se yad ata ha clg days kash ye waqat wapis asakta ye wo waqat ha jo marty dam tk nh bhol sakta i love my these days 
Q. Why was Krish not eating hot paratha?a. Krish's face is poor.b. Krish is missing Ananya. Is visible in paratho d. He has shouted Q2. Why are you here Krish? a. Part's marriage b. To get rid of pain c. Ananya was harmed. Say sorry 
Jism ye kya hai...khokli seepi...jism da moti hai tu️...most heart touching line
7 years of this beautiful song, still it gives goosebumps whenever you hear it, one of the most underrated song 

Still fresh in 2021. All songs from the album are so soothing.

Yup m from pure hindu community &amp; my x was jatt punjabi army man ,, was too much convincing my parents but they doesn&#39;t allow ,, n he&#39;s getting marry wid someone&#39;s else  &amp; m still single 

Ronit Roy is so underrated!

Loving the vibe of this music

The story started with the recommendation of the same book, and she left one day. And the guy is still there, waiting... with this song.I hope she is happy, wherever she is... 

Me and my gf are at the same point right now due to caste issues. I am from Gujarat and she is from Chhattisgarh. Her family is not accepting me and her family has disconnected each &amp; every contact between us.

This song makes me miss my ex I never had !!

Shankar Ehsaan Loy's composition 
There is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the cuckoo, there is no rain in the sky, why my hand is not there in the sky, there is no rain in the gun in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky. Goodbye, this same rain will go forever forever. Adhoori goodbye, this same rain will go forever. Oh, moonlight to rain. Why did I put my hand here? What is the secret of the sun's anger?

Heart touch song miss u 

I can relate to this song right now My life is going on like this

<a href="">3:08</a> perfect hair, trimmed beard, no bruises, fresh look, why the hell she asked &quot;kya haal bana rakha hai apna&quot;?

I love intercaste relationships as a bengali born i always wanted to marry a non bengali girl.

<a href="">

Best song 
Life moves on so do we but a part of us still remains out there, missing &#39;the one&#39;, every night listening to this masterpiece!

Only movie in which I think Arjun does acting.

saddest part of this movie is yes bank

️ Bring back all those singers, composers and lyricist .

My favorite
I am here to fuck you in love…
I love you so much music 

This song deserves more attention

Anyone listening in 2021? This song has different feel it will never replaced 

When Alia said, stop calling me, or else I have to block your number

Don&#39;t know why this movie nd this song have a special place in my heart.. Can&#39;t get over it..may be because somewhere it matches my story ️

This song has my 

Tujh bin faagun me faag nehi re....Tujh bin aagun me faag nehi re...These lines stole my heart️
A1

Equal balance
The family members do not agree to the marriage - then the girl gets married in such a way that she gets married to the boy of her father's choice - the boy (meaning the girl's bf) spends so much on that poor thing, that is what he knows  doesn't eat It doesn't work out - it doesn't look good - it gets ruined, you poor thing, it gets completely depressed - life gets totally disturbed - you don't know when the parents will understand this thing, what kind of pain does that person go through? rahe hai 
I love this pair ️

Shankar Ehsaan Loy is a national treasure ️
God, can&#39;t belive it&#39;s already been 6+ years..

I don&#39;t listen to this song cuz it reminds me of someone else but rather because it reminds me of myself and how with every passing year i lose myself from someone who was once very passionate and had dreams to someone just mediocre and average

Patanjali* Stm pls come back.It feels this movie is made on us, only we are not one
The time when Arjun Kapoor could act

Best song of my life. Really awesome. Loved it

Starting 2021 with this ️

<a href="">

What a nice song when im first year im also listen a song 50 times at a hour..

Song-1 Acting-0

A message for those who are struggling.I will never know your struggles personally,but I assure you we all are in this together.To everyone who has gone through unspoken tragedies,I believe you.To everyone who sits quietly in the back of roomWhile everyone is enjoying,I see you.To everyone who cries when the whole world is asleep,I hear you.To everyone who is going through pain,I feel you.To everyone who is reading thisYou are not alone.It isn&#39;t your fault.You are not weak for crying.You matter.You do deserve love and happiness.You can do it.You are beautiful inside and out the just way you are.I m sending my love to all.P.S :- if you ever need someone to talk ,my Dm is always open (Am good listener).

Just one movie world, Arjun Kapoor keeps laughing.




This is hurting me..

An underrated song yet so meaningful...every line is relatable.

2 States and Badrinath Ki Dulhania, two of my guilty pleasure movies. Alia looked so.cute and pretty in both, and both movies had some nice songs.

Underrated song.....breakup guys will know the pain of this song... thanks to Bollywood....

This song is so clear, it is so emotional that even when the heart is sad, it makes the heart feel the most, what happens is that it remembers the mother...
This bank made investors cry .

Most of the times , parents push one kid to the limit where he or she doesn&#39;t want to come back.i don&#39;t know why? I have lost my younger brother because of my father mentality,if I had a job I would have lived the same life cus I am being pushed over the limitations on their decision.i have been judged for having manners and intelligence.

Some masterpieces remain underratedSad

I love alia in 2 states

The song has been sung by me from all the scattered hearts of my life, my dear.. Your sufferings, your deeds, both of you have looted the best line ️
Life is so same like movie

This movie, this novel, every song of this is just...<a href="">#op</a>

any one else belt the chorus out when they&#39;re in the shower or are you guys normal?

Who is listening in the end of 2020?

When I was in 11th I used to listen this song and felt like I had breakup with my gf but then literally I asked myself I don&#39;t have any gf man..This entire album very close to my heart, it&#39;s reminding me each n every moment of my college journey where I started my college ️️️..2 States is like HUMARE JAMANE KI MOVIE ️️

I also said this
This song pulled best out of arjun Kapoor

This song has something amazing which force me back to listen time to time ...Love it ️

Turn bin jaage pair built ja nahi re.
I love this song ️

This song is so soulful also some part of the song reminds of dil chaahta hai lyrics

Good song
For people who comments &quot; anyone Listening in &quot;Year&quot; Believe me, this song will be lisented for a loong time.

And we broke up.....

I love you alia bhatt
This song has my heart FOREVER 

Years passed ,still one of my favorites 

This music video is very well-directed. You can notice this at many points during the video, none more than the point when Alia Bhatt starts walking away and the music starts playing at the exact same time.This song is so beautiful, it deserves much more praise for its background score and amazing lyrics.

Arjun Kapoor should do the romantic genre but he is still not there.
Why intercaste marriage not allowed???? Family k liye apni pyar ko b sacrifice karnapadta hai...I wish when ever u are plz happy that... <a href="">#Deekshya</a>

I also heard this song in October ..anyone like me???

&quot;You are singing from the hearts scattered around me&quot; amazing af
Awesome song, awesome lyrics this song is a gem in this movie ,, only irritating thing is arjun kapoor apart from that everything is top notch

One of the two good films done by Arjun Kapoor 

A good lesson is always important for yourself...

Chandaniya to barse..Fir kyu mere...haat andhere rahde ne 

Just saw the trailer for Ginny weds Sunny and Vikrant Massey would have been so much better for this role!!

Who is listening these in Oct 2020

It hurts you more when you&#39;re single

<a href="">#39;t Miss this..

My all time favorite song why undrreted yrr 

I am a Muslim or he is a Hindu, finally even his parents do not support him and even if he is a Hindu, he will not hesitate to do so. We both are without each other. I never married my wife. Tired hogya hoon y sb se. What should I do? He could not climb his parents yet. He loves his parents too and does not differ even for a day. What should I do if I have less time.....
I like the song  nice song

<a href="">4:46</a> to <a href="">4:56</a> Arjun realize SSR sir k sath humlogo se galat Kiya

This Arjun Kapoor is lost somewhere.

This song is so underrated. Nobody ever talks about it. A golden gem in this album. Only true music lovers will come back to this song.

adhuri kahani hi reh gyi

The sun continues in 2020
When i was studying for engineering and she took admission in bsc after 2yrs of coaching for medical.. her parents were use to ask my gotra, my plans , my choice.. in her studies i supported her like anything so that she can achieve her dream to be a doctor.. now she is a doctor and i am preparing for my job and her parents said i dont meet her standards. Try to make some distance from him. And now yesterday she was asking me for a nice good bye. And when i couldn&#39;t handled this thing i started crying and calling her again and again.. now she blocked me from everywhere.  its been three days I didn&#39;t sleep feeling sick and msging and calling her again and again while i knw tha i am blocked.. and suddenly this song played and after watching this everything turned black. 

Still reading the book

What am I really thankful for...this story has been read, listen to me in full.
baki sab to apni jagah hai parathe ki kya glti, gussa to parathe khane k bd bi kiya jaa skta h

Loved the track...so soothing.....Adhoori kahahi...Adhoora Alvida......

Fasta hamesha ladka hi kyu hai ?? Family mein bhi girlfrnd bhi bol deti  hai call krna band kro..

I feel like slapping him continuously every day .. bullshit.. how come he become even an actor.. total rubbish..

Alia was amazing in this flim.

Plz dont judge but starkids have acting in them...at least some of them do have like arjun and alia...soo yeah

There is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the cuckoo, there is no rain in the sky, why my hand is not there in the sky, there is no rain in the gun in the sky, there is no rain in the sky, there is no rain in the sky. Goodbye, this same rain will go forever forever. Adhoori goodbye, this same rain will go forever. Oh, moonlight to rain. Why did I put my hand here? What is the secret of the sun's anger? What is the secret of the body of the sun? The soul is as small as you are in the garage, the change in my life is my support. O mother, I am singing from the scattered heart.. my sister, my deeds, both the robbers have laid down the light in the sky, there is no anger in the sky, there is no anger in the sky, there has been no rain, then why have I held my hand here and there, Adhoori Adhoori Adhoori story, Adhoora goodbye, Yunhi raina jaaye Adhoore SadaaAdhoori Adhoori A sad story, a sad goodbye, the same rain always comes, Na Na Na… Na Na Na… Then why did my hand hold on to you without you… O MahiyaDin Dariya, the rain made me laugh.
Who is here after sushant&#39;s death

Everytime I listen to this make me feel overwhelmed ️

Why so underrated?

Arjun worked at yes bank and yes bank is no more now

Exactly 

What is this body, the hollow sippi has given the soul to you...
Jb blood lete wakt caste nhi dekha jata to shaadi krte time q dekha jata 
Why did you find the secret of your anger? This body is a hollow sip of the soul that you have given me... How much punishment is there in my life in exchange of you...you are pouring out from all my scattered sources...tere. Without this month, it started raining a lot.
Wen Sunsilk meet yes bank..

Still listening in 2020 love this song.

Am I the one listening this in quarantine.

Shankar Mahadevan ️ Right up there with the greatest...... Great lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya.

I have deep feelings for this song.. Right now I am in the same situation of Alia bhatt. I broke up with him as family is not accepting us but it feels like hell. My best wishes for him.

I also like a Tamil girl. Her name is also Ananya. Let’s see what happens 

Song is awesome... But I come here for that conversation.... 

The song is good, but remember this is from T Series. Name is enough to show
Acting of arjun and alia looks impressive in this movie.

One of my favorite!

Tm khud v kr skti ho uska no.
Kuch movies aur songs aese hote jinse kuchh alag hi bonding  aur old memories  ka relation hota haimissing badly  my old days 

Bhaag Chaloo
Adhura goodbye 
Miss my life

Why don't you write such songs
Anyone else notice that the song is a lil fast

Heart melting song for me , i have just witnessed a breakup

Most underrated song I think

This song deserves million likes  hats off to the makers ...

This song dedicated to someone..... adhura alvida .....

Love this song. Really under appreciated though.

lineswith all the feelings..though I haven&#39;t met with that so called emotion of &quot;breakup&quot; but yet..this song has all that magic..which can make u feel the unsaid pain <a href="">#may</a>_god_never_ever_dettach_to_hearts_being_bounded_by_destiny️️

Anyone in 2020 in lockdown

the line fits perfect to &quot;KD teri narazgi&quot; <a href="">2:19</a>, (KD Pathak)

Kuch bhi bolo bhai ... ye film  bhohot  mast hai... iske gaane to dil jeet lete hai...

I miss.,...adhuri adhuri kahani adhura alvida .....
I miss u gargi may God bless your soul.

everyone deserves someone like Krish or Ananya in my opinion.

When you were totally perplexed in your life then this song give you something seriously . Just believe it

amazing video nonetheless the only method that worked for me is... look up in Google this without gaps <b>GetP aidHo m e .c o m</b>

Saja to mjhe mil rhi h n arjun kapoor

Reason of collapse of yes bank

Block karwana padega?  wo to nain khud se hi kar leta hoon, number blick

<a href=""> B praak new song full videoChandniya

Many Indian couples have same situation..

close to my heart

who came here just after hearing about yes bank?

Teenage days ️️
Kids : remember their gf/bfMen: I am single. Legends: Feeling sorry for YES Bank..

If you&#39;re listening to this. I have to say you have a good taste in music.

-Why do we love each other, isn't it enough? -Never happened.
The comment section is the true reflection of the reality the film is based on.

I have been in such situation... But the saddest part is that in spite of trying so very hard... Lastly I attended her marriage

Everyone&#39;s taliking about their stories but no one&#39;s talking about how beautifully the song has been composed by SEL

Who is watching after the Yes Bank debacle?

In our India, why we give more importance to Caste, religion, state rather than Love. Because, there is One God everywhere. Love has not Boundary of any Caste, religion, love is like independence and freedom.... :)In India we take Religious as too much serious.

Might sound weird. Even stupid, but I can&#39;t imagine anyone else in this role other than Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt. They were perfect.P. S. I should&#39;ve added that what I&#39;ve stated above is what I feel. Everyone has their own opinions which might differ from mine, and I totally understand and respect them.

You are always in search of love and once you get that focus on it give your all to make it yours. Believe in your love, build your trust make it all happen for you. History says - Love never dies, It goes on.

Adhoori kahaniyan...so painful even after so long 
The story of this movie is completely similar to my life.. the only difference is that I could not convince my family to marry me or I was not united but they stole me and married someone else, my life is incomplete without her. Oh my god.. this happens only in the movies, in real life we ​​can't do anything.. how can our family and society find our love.. Nice movie.
Me and bf are from two different caste he is Maharashtrian and i am punjabi... In our relation we also came at a point where we can leave eachother but we waited and show trust  n now finally  after 4 years we are getting married  with our families blessing

Vima kumar i love you song

Your sorrows, your deeds, all your loot, neither the sky nor the sky, neither the night nor the night, neither the night nor the night, why my hands lag here and there. Kahaani, Adhoora AlvidaYunhi Yunhi Raina Jaaye Adhoore SadaaAdhoori Adhoori Adhoori Kahaani, Adhoora AlvidaYunhi Yunhi Raina Jaaye Adhoore SadaaNa Na Na…Na Na Na..Phir Kyun Mere Haath Adhere Na Lagde Ne Tere Bina..O MahiyaDin Dariya, Rain Jazeere Lagde Ne.
