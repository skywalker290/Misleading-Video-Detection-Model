<a href="">13:44</a> close your eyes and just listen lol

We&#39;re still Czechoslovakia SURE :D

I sometimes really wonder what happened to this series

Bro is an engineer

From level 56 to 9 to 56 again 🤔

<a href="">9:41</a> he looked really good here even tho he says that he’s a slob lol

i jumped down my chair when sven teleported in to the creeper frick cage

The council has returned. This is such good news to me. OG watersheep can live on

<a href="">9:31</a> Damn, this is a journey

<a href="">7:49</a> This is turned very culty

bri got honeyblocks from Československo. Nice.

From water sheep to space sheep 😂

The one who claims to be my mother has your image and pp.

You did not even know who you were.

My son was my husband

So being you are not to worried to get your pp back, if you want/need it.....well IAM going to allow you to get it your self.

All of you let me suffer.....

Help me retrieve your pp

pewds was so happy having so much fun playing at the start of the series and it was enjoyable to watch......but  after the dragon things changed.....things got weird.... i thought damn, pewds might actually have some mental problems......then i thought  I must have some mental problems for still watching this lol

council of water shjeep!

<a href="">2:34</a> I wonder what Marzia&#39;s reaction is to hearing pewdiepie screaming &quot;INGVAR&quot; from his room

<a href="">3:56</a>)))))))))))))))

<a href="">7:35</a> not again...

pewds went from &quot;tHEres HOrsEs iN MinCRafT&quot;to&quot;is there machine guns in mincraft&quot; what happend to this play through

Time Traveler Pewds confirmed? He would have had to go back at least 32 years to import honey from Czechoslovakia...

Russian Pewds confirmed?

<a href="">1:40</a> new best music your house looks amazing

Imagine if jeb_ and grey watersheep are different sheeps.

Bro I usually play Bredock Editoin so to see a piston pull a slime block and that then pull others attached to it just defies all laws of Minecraft to me

I love how it starts just fine, him building his redstone contraptions, showing off the base, messing with mobs just a little bit, like spawning some chickens to punish a creeper, and then immediately spirals downward into madness with: ThErE Is A WaY To BrInG BaCk ThE CoUnCiL Of WaTeRsHeEp?

Police Officer: &quot;We found copious amounts of cocaine inside your house&quot; Me: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s imported from Czechoslovakia&quot;

When did pewds become mumbo jumboHez speaking redstone language

i can imagine felix going in creative mode here and saying its alright because he imported creative mode from Czechoslovakia

Why did the last half of this series become an acid trip??!!! Fuckin Banjo Kazooie sounds are driving me nuts. Oof.

He&#39;s turning in to mumbo jumbo

is this canon?

remmember when this was a normal series

<a href="">1:54</a> I think I head it

What Shep is mod

I completely forgot about how good McMakistein was at his job! I&#39;ve seen a lot of what he created!

AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA

Pewds: don’t you <b>EVER</b> TOUCH HIM-Ingvar: <b>*doesn’t have hands*</b>

That egg farm is awful.

Wait do everyone feel weird because felix minecraft camera being smaller or is it just me

fun fact pewdiepie went to creatove mode and spawned the sheep inside ikea tower

<a href="">1:45</a> ; Listen closely.. it sounds like the drums in Rio, when the movie is about to introduce the monkeys.

How does he have different XP whenever he respones

<a href="">13:44</a>

i have a friend from czech

tết coi hài cho vui nhà vui cửa

Sven sounds like he&#39;s been smoking for fifteen years

What happened to this searies

the chicken beat slaps

Look at all those chickens

Watersheep was always this powerful, he was just too afraid to say it

I heard the song the chimckens made its like uhhh uhhhh uhhh uhh

When he think checkoslovakia still exists: Im sorry, it&#39;s dead

I&#39;ve never thought those cheap ass sounds affect will be this funny

watersheep seems harder to beat than the ender dragon

Bruh water sheep legit stronger than wither

I love how sven talks like:GRAGU GO GRE GU GAA GRO RU RUR JA

When you realizeThat Water sheepWas stronger thanEnder dargon

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been two years

Pog

Imagine if pewdiepie never got even

Since when did the animal characters have weird voices?

BIG BRAIN redstone secret door

Some sheep, escaping from a farm, stuck in a small area of water: Ah, well.... hope I get fed atleast.A couple minutes later, Felix: <b>He was like father too me...</b>The ghost of the stuck sheep: <b>Why tf am I a God?</b>

Top 20 most epic anime fight

Not sure if anyone else has notice or appreciates it but I love how you are using the Banjo-Kazooie/Banjo-Tooie character voice sounds as your Minecraft character voices. It’s hilarious and nostalgic.

Find a sheep, perform the sacrificial ritual. When its done, get another sheep ready for the next ritual XD

Subtiles is saying at Hnoeu block Hyundai hock

The base of your house light is awsome

Honey blocks imported from Czechoslovakia.... huh

Pewds, Czechoslovakia split up a long time ago, how frickin old is that honey?

Ok, I loved this series, but it became pointless when Sven’s bf died and he lost his mind.

i miss the time when the animal doesnt make creepy sounds when talking to pewd

This fight can’t be a actual thing from mojang haha. This whole fight against causal of water sheep and a demonic water sheep feels like a extremely weird puff puff trip. If this is a actual thing then I love mojang more than ever

Ultimate

What’s up?<b>dies on inside and remembers</b> IKEA Tower!!!!!!!!!

I love how deranged he gets while the series progresses. Thats character development!! 👏👏

Anyone rewatching this is a legend also gato

the water sheep in the boss fight wasn&#39;t rainbow, or named jebb, so its not the real water sheep

I don’t understand the noises I have confusion and will never watch this series again

This dude continues to shock me with his creative mind the deeper I get into this series

<a href="">11:00</a> His health bar is enourmus!

<a href="">11:22</a> water sheep be like: &quot;you are under my genjutsu&quot;

I’ve seen PewDiePies series 3 times and never really thought about this but he is literally talking to himself and he doesn’t get bored

9 year olds be like: try summon water sheep in minecraft PE world

When Minecraft became creepy than resident evil

Czechoslovakia does not existed since 1993.

how many of u noticed he summoned water sheep in another world and came back to broland after defeating it . just look at his xp levels

Ur redstone thing literally taught me how to make better secret things

Felix be like:Water Sheep:he was like a father to meThe creeper:he was like the father to meAll the things:he was like father to me

We love czech representation

Czechoslovakia ended at 1993. I know it bcs I am Czech

Felix starts off the video by finishing his new house. Afterwards, he creates an infinite egg dispenser at Ingvar and makes a piston door and lighting system for his basement. He finds a blue sheep on the edge of his base, which tells him he needs to do the ancient ritual to bring back Council of Water Sheep. They go on top of the meatball, and Pewds flies away, a lead attached to the sheep. But he dies. Then he flies to IKEA Tower to find another sacrificial sheep. At IKEA Tower, there is a white sheep. He attaches a lead to that sheep. But it breaks while Pewds is flying down. He then flies back up and punches the sheep off of IKEA Tower, causing that sheep to die of severe fall damage. Later, he finds another sacrificial sheep and does that the same thing he did to kill Water Sheep. This summons Water Sheep, and Water Sheep battles him, ultimately killing him. After the battle is done, he get three things (which all look like carrots on sticks); Rainbow trail, which leaves a trail of wool behind Pewds when he walks; Wool-ring, which does damage to all mobs around Pewds in a certain radius (diamond pickaxes get thrown in the air, too); and Meatball Nuke, which does a big explosion around Pewds, even killing himself. He returns back to his his base and he goes to Water Sheep&#39;s church, and sure enough, Council of Water Sheep is back

His house was flooding, but he couldn&#39;t not play Minecraft.GAMER RESPECT!

how many health does the sheep even have

<a href="">7:20</a>Chicken-pocalypse

Because you killed water sheep now he is a boss fight you have to take him out because this is water sheep&#39;s revenge cuz you haven&#39;t make his life better

I&#39;m proud to get 15 likes in YouTube😂

Me: being Czech pewds: it&#39;s OK I imported it from Czech SlovakiaI was very honored and was the most egnoliged

My teacher is always wearing your merch.

<a href="">2:28</a>uhhhhhhhhh excuse me what???????

The chickens are having a party to the beat that there making ( yes I could hear the chicken beat).

CZECHOSLOVAKIA!!!!!

Why is pewdiepie concerned with bringing back counsel of water sheep? He literally killed them.

Why does this feel like a filler episode?👁👄👁

U WANT PEWDS MAKE A SKY CITY

Why does PewDiePie import from Czechoslovakia? Maybe because we are the best, after Sweden

/kill @e[type=minecraft:chiken]

imagine still saying Czechoslovakia instead of Czech AND Slovakia

Pewds you can hold fireworks in your off-hand and if you charge a crossbow with fireworks in you off hand you will be able to shoot fireworks

How ,what??

Pewdiepie using comparators to delay a signal for his secret doorRepeater: <b>am I a joke to you?</b>

When Water Sheep Council said, “woiwoiwoiwoi woiwoiowiowio”That hit me on a personal level

Wait where is the farmers and ulla brita and llama of tower AND THE FRICK CHAMBER AND THE POLAR BEAR THEY ARE STILL MISSING

wait a minute the second pewds resumed the game you can see the lan world option not acceseble so he used cheats to do something

Felix after launching Ikea tower to space: Never talks about it again

this vid was made a year ago today

I think Water sheep/jeb_ is the strongest boss ever..!

Looks like water sheep learnt a few things while he was stuck there

This is like the revenge of the sith, the good one became bad

<a href="">5:00</a> big brain moment

Its official pewd is losing it...

Now this was shadow clone jutsu

Chickens can make children two was egg and kiss y?

Anyone else realize how he started loosing views on the series since he started “friking” animals..?

Everybody Gangsta until the Water sheep spawns.

PEWDIEPIE IS A REDSTONE MASTER!

At this point it’s just Felix doing dumb crap in creative lmbo

Wow he&#39;s so great at building

i heard the sound

Who is watching in 2020? I should be learning for a class text

AYO THOSE R DIFFERENT COLOR WOTER SHEEPPP

this is beginning to become some demonic shit

I hope you burn in hell for torment in these innocent animals

I love when people still talk about Czechoslovakia as if it still was a state

i think water sheep is revengeing to you for all have you done when hes living

Pewdiepie,: says czechoslovakia.  Me: in czechoslovakia :D

Just czech and slovakia :)

when pewdiebie says Czechoslovakia

<a href="">10:06</a>   look at his levels he died once

Thank you for mentioning my country czechoslovakia Now i just bought an ikea in my neighbourhood and ima destroy it

watersheep using shadow clone jutsu

im dead like almost dead because how this series went and how i thought i got covid

how did he get from lvl 56 to lvl 8 at <a href="">10:10</a> and then again lvl 56 at the end of the video

<a href="">4:54</a> 10000 iq

why pewdiepie makes the mobs sound different it gives me the CREEP CREEPS!

<a href="">10:13</a> .... Gross

this series has become a 2016 minecraft roleplay

When the creeper said: opyorp, I felt that.

Why did you put on a flashback about killing watership in one of your video,s

Felix: &quot;I loved you like a father&quot; <a href="">13:17</a>Felix at the last episodes: <b>torture defendless water sheep to death</b>

This is very real

creeper fricks sven

We all know pewdiepie didn&#39;t make all these things by himself

I love minecraft ❤️

Felix can you play gta 5 its a mission game

<a href="">0:01</a> best intro in life

I think the way felix communicates to his pets is strange and weird not gonna lie (not hating btw lol)

It was like six paths of pain

epic council

Hey why pweds can talk to her pets thats not real in minecraft

Is It Just Me Or Does Ingvar&#39;s Voice Sound VERY Similar To Corpse&#39;s Voice?

felix:takes 30 episode to defeat the ender dragon Dream:takes 44m to kill ender dragon with 4 hunters killing him.

Sven&#39;s Necklace always change color. It was blue it was red and NOW IT&#39;S GREEN and leter in video blue again!!??

It is a fake

i thought i was watching nade king from the intro

Where is Felix getting all of the honey and slime blocks from in his new episodes he has no idea how bees work

Pewds: I have so much cactusAlso pewds: Why did it stop

Wait pewds understand the language of gods?

He can’t remember how to make a piston door but he built an actual fucking rocket last episode

Whos from czechoslovakia like

I love all the Banjo-Kazooie noises for the various mobs lol.

Dont Watch This Timestamp With Your Parents TimeStamp:  <a href="">13:44</a>

Can you speak hindi

<a href="">6:35</a> sumting rong wid pewds green screen

This man is going insane

Pewdiepie is so silly(That’s a good thing)

Big brain

Notch: What in the world are you doing Felix?Felix: My goals are far beyond your understanding.

The name yurgen is bad luck

<a href="">07:31</a> this is the moment for me when it began to be too cringy to watch.

Pewd: <b>*Says Czechoslovakia*</b>Czech Republic: So have you chosen death

I was aad in the last epsoide

Subtitles say council of water sheep is council of authorship!

pewds let&#39;s go bowling !

Why the hell your Minecraft dog has emotions?

Hello 👋

Bring watersheep back

You are a noob

You can make machine guns but you   cannot hold and move them you can put 4 dispensers and connect them to 4 repeaters in a circle connect the repeaters to a lever give it a pulse even shorter than a button and the dispensers will fire forever using arrows will be cool

Pewdiepie you can make torts for this is a liver to create a b or sleever unique of stone underneath towards unitop and you&#39;re done making also in the crafting table

are ya mumbo jumbo???

L

pewdiepie gets low on health the video aight imma skip this

that&#39;s right for him!!!he killed watersheep

PewDiePie ur the best YT ever

Just when I thought there was peace in this playthrough, Council of Watersheep was mentioned 😔.P.S.:- This is my favourite anime. I think it even surpasses all the mainstream animes.

<b>YOU HAVE ANGERED THE LORD WATERSHEEP</b>

Is PewDiePie actually poultry man?

<a href="">6:20</a>thats where i left off at so yea there nothing good about this timestamp

<a href="">3:51</a>That looks so lit

i couldnt  watch last cos it had bad graphics :-(

I felt that Sven saying babubububa

Are there Machine Guns in Minecraft🤣🤣🤣

Who remember’s his birch tree on the middle of his small house?😢😢

This is the strangest mod.. ....

How did he go from 69 xp to 56 xp?

i&#39;m still at a loss for how tf he literally launched the first ikea tower

The ancient water sheep is back for revenge against his killer

<a href="">0:41</a> I laughed way to hard at this.

Little Did He Know While He Was Biulding His Secret Door At His House He Could Just Use Scaffolding

Pewdiepie aka new mambo jumbo

<b>After pewd mentioned about the melody played by the chimken, it cant get out of my head</b>

The sound effects lol

The sheep is the last naruto descendent. Look at the skills.

everyone gansta up until pewdiepie is the new mumbo

Despair

<a href="">1:51</a>I remembered the movie The Chicken Escape

Great!!!!

I’m so confused how he was blown up with 10 xp then got home with 56 xp...

Poor Pewdipie when Sven doesn’t look at him!

Watersjeep story arch so far-  watersjeep suffered throughout his life he was like jeasus in a way...... later on people realized that he was infact a holy being. A council of watersheep emerged as 3 mysterious watersheeps were found in the temple of watersheep (2 yellow an 1 blue). However a red watersheep infiltrates their rankes as the blue watersheep gies missing. The red watersheep conspires with the watersheep council an influenced pewdiepie to commit crimes like killing seven&#39;s b.f..... pewdipie realizes his falut  an goes off to lice in a far away land where he finds a new friend feigi the chicken. At first pewds suspects feigi but later on they become friends but as it turns out feigi was indeed an assassin sent by the council of watesheep to kill pewdipie. Pewds defats feigi returns to broland and kills the current watersheep council an constitutes the beetroot council. However the bluewatersjeep returns an tells pewds to reinstate the watersjeep council an soo pewdipie removes the beetroot council defeats the vengful ghost of the original watersjeep and reinstates the a new council of watersjeep

Why is pewds covering his chin??!!! I’m getting bad memories

That’s why u don’t kill watersheep

His cheating

A lecture

Why is it like your doing fun science. Minecraft edition

this not mod

his the real water sheep

Russia

Mam revjaj :D

Anyone who has seen Underpants / undertale Felix said don&#39;t touch my child( the gumball president meme) we all know where this is going😐

Creeper

K

He do that because you kill him with magma

I read the title as &quot;I summoned a lesbian&quot; at first for some reason.

when felix doesnt have his texture pack on you know its gonna be weird

<a href="">0:38</a>CreeperAw man

I love the animal sounds you made 😂😂

Pewds: Use’s a comparator                             Me: JUST USE A REPEATER

2 days ago the water sheep death1 like = 1 respect

kill all the chicken

Your so good at red stone

Imagine how different the world would be if that sheep hadn’t gotten stuck in that corner filled with water

My question is how did the sheep get on that tower?

Sven hates it when mobs or animals get Hurt

the god reincarnation of water sheepthat’s it

I was sent here from the future to tell you that your beloved horse Joergn is going to die.

Pewdiepie- “ I cant remember how to build it t but I will try Me - “ I wouldn’t be able to build that even if Mumbo jumbo teaches me”

When he forgot to turn on the lights it gave me serious 2013 pewds vibes

Give Pewdiepie Minecraft big brain award

The second half of this series isn’t really enjoyable, well at least compared to the first half but I still watch it anyways

Where has Ulla Britta been lately?

Minecraft used to be so innocent

Rip water sheep

Felix playing for some months: <b>Become a redstone engineer</b>Me playing for decades: <b>Puts pressure plate infront of doors</b>

How does he die and keep all his levels

The second season is so interesting.

When watersheep is harder to beat then the ender dragon

WATERSHEEP = POWER OF GODS

Ouf

<a href="">3:11</a> I thinks sfin was corrupted by the creeper

Jätte smart chyklingar lyssna aldrig på Ingvar.

Bro u did all this in creative or survival

&quot;myam revyaw&quot;

Pewds summoned water sheep in a different world because at his base he was at 56 XP points and when he summoned water sheep he was at 10 XP points

Look fighting water sheep he has 10 levels, when he came back home after he defeat watersheep his levels became 56! Can someone EXPLAIN THIS

I ever experienced sheep chase me in Minecraft

OMG THEY MAKING MUSIC! MUSIC CHEKEN

Unlocked hidden memory: WAtER SheEp?

Those chickens r funky

Love how Watersheep used the clone jutsu lmao

Everybody keeps changing their voices.

Pewds: SVEN! Don&#39;t ever touch that creeper!Me: But he&#39;s immune...

We need a Pewdiepie, Jacksepticye and Markiplier collab

Since the death of water sheep he has never been the same again

Wait a sec...in the last episode...Felix launched the old ikea tower to the sky USING LOADS OF <b>HONEY</b> BLOCKS and slime blocks, but then now he doesn’t even know how to get honey...🤔HOW DID YOU FORGET? It’s been five months. <b>five</b>

thank god this wasnt minecraft hardcore

Me watching full series again and bruh i was drinking milk at <a href="">8:58</a> and now my shirt is wet lol

Pewdiepie id this in real minecraft

Did Felix say fucking bitch in the mercy plug?

Pewds:Fake watersheepAlso Pewds:I love u like a father

Its funny that pewds doesnt use any of the acual stuff that he got.

I wonder how his father feels when Felix calls all these fake animals his fathers? Lmao

Did anyone else notice that the council of water sheeps colors were reversed?  The yellow one is in the middle now and the blue ones are to the side of him, but the blue sheep used to be in the middle and the yellow sheep were to the side.

The chickens have synchronized flaps lmaooo 😂

Beyoureself and never surrenderPewdipie is my idol

ikea tower is now ikea space ship

Felix are you okay. I am genuinely concerned

Czechoslovakia 😑 It&#39;s czech republic or slovakia.

I really want to be a member, but it costs money.

Can&#39;t even understand the language!! <a href="">0:02</a>

He said cyca blyat mean fing botch but me no swore

is sven A boy?

I always thought Felix lived in Minecraft but it turns out it was just a green screen. 😪

<a href="">7:43</a> disgusting sounds,the sounds like a poop💩

PewDiePie: look now the basement is lit tell me wat u thinkMe: it LIT 😂

Skykia tower

PewDiePie then: whats this red stuff?PewDiePie now:..........

When pewdiepie mentioned czekoslovakiaEvery slovak and czech mind:💥💥💥💥😱😱😱💥💥🤣(im slovak)

His editing is like the funny aspects of the older Garry&#39;s Mod comedy videos 😆Look up GMOD Idiot Box Episode 9 by DasBoSchitt

Wotr Sjep fljoiided pewds house I’m sure of it

He’s slowly going insane

Me yelling at the screen: &quot;WATERSHEEEP KILL HIM&quot;

I feel like every time I watch pewdiepie play Minecraft, I take a college course in red stone.

Water sheep getting revenge justice for jeb

should had trapped it in boat

This series has gotten a little worse not gonna lie

U could have just udsed a repeater for the opening floor

You can make manga out of this and it&#39;s still will be good series

I fucking love this series and I dont care if Felix cheats, but cmon. I doubt he could build like that in this first year of minecraft. Sometime when he builds and does a jumpcut you see single blocks in this hotbar, which suggests he was in creative. But idc this series is hilarious. Best minecraft letsplay ever. We need more

<a href="">13:45</a> a seconds away from watersheeps death

We need more main character boss battles like so he can see

No Czechoslovakia czech republic And Slovakia two country

love how his accent comes out when he goes insane about something

<a href="">13:45</a> 😳😳😳

What kind of music do you listen to?It&#39;s kind of complicated...<a href="">1:40</a>

<b>*sigh...*</b> what happened to the nice wholesome intros?

When PewDiePie is better at Redstone than usDang he&#39;s finally learning.

Me: <b>obsessed with cacti</b>Pewds: “I made so much cactus”Me: HA HA HA HA HA I LOVE THIS SERIES

Give an Anime Opening and this series will be an anime for sure

<b>&quot;THE BATTLE OF THE GODS&quot;</b>

Pewdiepie: Says good morning gamers. Its night time

Where is your trident

&quot;you think what about you done&quot;

1;39 pewds lost in his feels

Poo poo pee pee

we all know he used creative to get the slime and honey blocks

Wait... is this real? Can you do this? I have so many questions. Not big enough p p apparently

It was a slime block

<a href="">3:04</a> ingvar will eventually die

I appreciate Felix&#39; slow descent into madness.

I heard the chicken beat

Wow

Why no Justice for jeb_?  :(

Pewdiepie get tge evil water sheep weapons

<a href="">5:37</a> but you can just delay the signal with a repeater

Who is from checkoslovakia like👍

No offense, but how could you build the roller coaster and the the meatball with your incredibly big-brain, but you had trouble with a simple trapdoor?

Does anyone know where he got these sound effects for the animals

long live water sheep

it&#39;s my b-day thank you for doing what you doing pewdiepie

Gamer moment

Since when does watersheep know shadow clone jutsu?

Pewdiepie cheated onCACTUS !!!

Pewdiepie is smart u know

I heard the Mine cart song

<a href="">6:40</a> how do you make this!?

<a href="">2:05</a> sounds like a knock off tardis.

This minecraft series become crepy

Is everyone just gonna ignore how pewdiepie did a perfect Russian accent in the beginning of the video?

Anyone else see how the creeper shot out of the ground

I&#39;m very curious now on how to set a tower stuck on the sky, I don&#39;t even know how red stones work to do that lmao

Hey dont you dare it&#39;s Rusia bad words

When pewdiepie finished his secret floor-door and saw the huge infestation of chickens I couldn’t stop laughing 😂 Im pretty sure we all saw it coming

Unsubscribe to t series

<a href="">13:43</a> sounds like premarital hugging.

Quite literally a sacrificial lamb

everybody gangsta till pewdiepie teaches redstone

<a href="">12:20</a>

I just realized that the water sheep council are different colors. It was two yellows not two blues

Sheep had a power cagibunshin tekinik like naruto

what has this series become

Always when the sheep fly he almost dies

Felix is turning into mumbo

Some technical gibberish starts form <a href="">5:04</a>

I thought that sven died

Slav comrade

Shouldn&#39;t water sheep be throwing tridents ?

Sven is like the son of a mafia boss and he doesn&#39;t want anyone to be hurt but whenever someone bullies him at school the bully and their family is never seen again.

Felix: This things use to be so painful, isnt that right svenMe: Remembers what he did to watersheep..xD

<a href="">14:27</a>G O L D foreshadowing

The new series is getting weird

<a href="">14:31</a> o no

<a href="">9:45</a> snake

<a href="">9:58</a> oof

<a href="">2:56</a> So that&#39;s where all the chickens come from.

Damn Pewdiepie is pro gamer Hes so smart!

<a href="">4:04</a>  Ahhhh its Czech and Slovakia. We are not together anymore.

The Forbidden minecraft  boss in my thoughts- EVIL...DANGEROUS...SAVAGEReality- watersheep

You should build an island for Ikea tower

<a href="">4:06</a> 😢

Didn’t he overthrow council of watersheep? And now he wants the council back? I don’t understand

Thats why you never fight your lord

lszarbeam  yeet

THIS IS WATER SHEEP REVENGE

Русским привет,остальным соболезную

Were watching mumbo jumbo’s swedish twin

I’m watching a grown man lose sanity due to a rainbow sheep. Why.

Would you rather to sub or sub?

pewdiepie how the fuck did you summon that watersheep?????????? it doesnt work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The boss fight looks like the fight with Deacons of the Deep in Dark Souls 3

When he said “ah you snake” I had to pause the video to wheeze

Felix is actually so good at redstone. He makes his own machines and that&#39;s 😎

IK I’m kinda late but u can’t be too far from a 0 tick farm without turning it off first. Otherwise it will break

Did I just get taught Redstone pulse extenders by PewDiePie

Remember when he said he would never cut down the tree of life I&#39;m still mad

THE COLECTOR

I ❤️ Minecraft

Me: <b>from Czech Republic</b>Pewds: <b>mentions czechoslovakia</b>Me: OwO <b>fangirling</b>

First it was Cows and Sheep, then it was Pigs now it&#39;s all...<b>CHICKEN</b>

What did he say in the beginning in Russian?

i thought filix is hearing something then i heard it

At <a href="">3:50</a> how did he do that with he&#39;s redstone lamp? Does someone have a tutorial?

I don&#39;t know why, but I see Felix playing Minecraft while holding his child (if him and Marzia would have one)..Halp.

I didn&#39;t know that Minecraft was so dangerous 😱😨

Sana makagawa ako ng ganto..  May nagawa na po ako sana bisitahin nyo channel ko umpisa palang po pero matutuwa kayo sa gawa ko. Tnx idol

Grian would be proud of the chickens

one of the weirdest turning points of the series

<a href="">1:23</a>

Jag Javla vill do

A redstone torch would be better.

Esse cara e de mais

Ummm Czechoslovakia Split Into 2

Felix before this episode he was alive remember when Joergen kept on disappearing, water sheep was gone too, he ESCAPED he was out there somewhere his brother went in the water, then in this episode you summoned him back and <b>KILLED</b> him.

<a href="">7:00</a> Felix: &quot;Unforseen Consequences&quot;Eli Vance: &quot;What did you just say to me?&quot;

it has come to a point when I don&#39;t understand if he&#39;s speaking russian, japanease, english, or swedish.

Can we just appreciate the mods people have been making for pewds !

I&#39;m still so confused whether if the Council of Watersheep is an ally or an enemy.

He uses two comparatorsSad mumbo jumbo noises

😅😅😅😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣

He chicken beat

Here and now we are awarded to Felix / PewDiePie for finding the rarest , most dangerous and powerful boss in Minecraft: water sheep!!

i am 9 years old and i watch you anyways pewdiepie

Pewds yelling at the creepers and giving them voices is the same as when Sky used to talk to squids XD

Dang, Pewds is coming for Mumbo Jumbo&#39;s career

The chicken farm sounds like the background sounds from fnaf 2

How did you respawn with you tools and XP?

Water sheep vs pewdiepie

Watersheep is like naruto

PewDiePie‘s dog is going to die because every single dog you own in Minecraft dies

PLEASE TURN ON KEEP INVENTORY

Felix rivals mumbojumbo with his redstone knowledge

Who creates these mods lol

The chicken music that you heard i heard

Pewdiepie committed a transmutation circle and has revived something besides water sheep

<a href="">7:17</a> I am infuriated at the fact that he missed the chance to say “look at all those chickens”

Czech-o-Slovakia doesn&#39;t exist anymore

me a Slavic/Czech:pewds:  it&#39;s okay I imported it from Czechoslovakiame: I have been recognized to the fullest of my extent

Why does his new house look like a barn

Im from the Czech republik

<a href="">11:29</a> 😨😱😨😨 crazy!

I’m surprised he hasn’t played the aether by now.

Mumbo jumbo: I have the best mechanics (?)Pewdiepie: hold my Sven

The secret door should be a carpet over the trapdoor lol
