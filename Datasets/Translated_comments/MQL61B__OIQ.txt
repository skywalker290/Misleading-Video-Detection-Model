This is called the gyroscopic effect, a bike in motion stays upright which make us bikers&#39; lives much easier. And because that Harley has a very high torque the engine even at idle keeps the bike going - unless the rider used the throttle thumb screw as cruise control. I wonder how he came off though... Silly stunt gone wrong maybe.

Seems like the bike wants to drive by its own casue it annoyed by the driver

Very bad editing

The bike is more balanced than my dating life

If I were whoever was driving the car, I would just turn and slam it into the wall.

<a href="">0:00</a>-<a href="">1:27</a> and lo I saw a bike who, even for a mere moment of a cruel life of slavery, truly lived as a free and sentient creature. May it always be remembered for it.

That&#39;s some great balance.

There is no mystery the rider fell off and the bike keeps going until a crushes.  That&#39;s why they don&#39;t show you how it crushed. Because that will take away the mystery 

And then crashed... 

what a wave
