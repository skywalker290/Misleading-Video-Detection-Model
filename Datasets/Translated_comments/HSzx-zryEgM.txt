Benedict Cumberbatch is really perfect for the role!!

This is it. It was a great movie. This is what it should be. There is no childish humor, there is no pity or endearment under the name of genocide. If it is going to be a movie, it should be away from such messages. Also, Thor&#39;s inclusion was a nice reference. I hope Dr. Strange movies do not break the line. If you watch Marvel in Chronological form, you will understand it better. Let me show you in a list.....

New eea of coding and use my  matérialise  matrix to build armor and suite

I miss the old days when marvel released these types of marvel trailers.😢🥺

2017 was 7 years ago

I just now realized that the title of the film sounds very promising. I no longer experience this just because I know this character. But it can be easily felt if you forget for a second that you know him. Just look through the eyes of the average person. Movie: Doctor Strange, sounds interesting, because... films about doctors are often very addictive, and the fact that he became a magician at the time the trailer was released is absolutely fire. I hope you understand😂❤
Looks like the movie Doctor Strange, 2016
Multiverse of Madness was good, but it just didnt give the same magical feelings as the first one did

Precisely true 😮

Opening To Doctor Stranger 2016 DVD
alles Sling Ring
Just came out today
still the best

My favorite 🥰
Back when doctor strange was both cool and smart

My dads favorite superhero was Doctor Strange I wish me and him could have gone and seen this movie in 2016 but he died in 2001.  I bet he would have loved it.

Book of veshanti is in sankrit language

Chapter shit
The best MCU character 🔥

watching this movie on acid is something wlse

Doctor Strange plays the piano??!

Master of mystic arts Sorcerer Supreme Dr. Strange 🐱

Come back

Thank you, marvel to shoot this great movie in our country Nepal.❤❤❤🙏

Back when Marvel was actually good. I miss this era of the MCU

I love this movie so much ❤

<a href="">1:44</a> crash building

2021 doctors strange telah master
&quot;I have spent so many years, peering through time, looking for you.&quot; awesome dialog, gives me goosebumps for some reason.

I just hope the former director that directing this film came back for the sequel and also the same vfx team. The whole movie experince for me was exquisite and rewatcheable everytime

Hes the best actor for this role

The music is best

It‘s just a perfect movie! I love it really! But do anyone of you know the soundtrack of this trailer? I didn‘t find it. Can you help me, please?

How did we get from THIS to MOM!the downgrade -_-I really hope DS3 will be good, and mcu should use this soundtrack and Doctor Strange&#39;s original theme from the 1st movie

&quot;We never lose our demons, morda. We only learn to live above them&quot; - the wise one

Smaug might be Cumberbatch’s iconic and irreplaceable role but his best performance is Doctor Strange

ahead of it&#39;s time imho...like the wizard of oz or even buckaroo banzai

sinister strange vs dr strange WHICH is the PRIME Universe in a MULTI VERSE reality?

I come back to say doctor strange is better than 2

I&#39;ve seen this movie. It&#39;s one of my favorites.

This movie is a masterpiece

Beautiful trailer, great story of movie but Strange you can&#39;t even defeat Scarlet Witch. Embarrassed

<a href="">2:09</a>

6 years after it&#39;s a very underrated MCU movie

This film is very good, yes, Doctor Strange, the editing is very good, the film actors are very good and all the actors are very good in their roles, thank you

Me watching this trailer in 2022 and realizing how good marvel cgi used to be

Her hands...

The movie of satanic

When CGI and detail mattered to them 🚶🏼

Take a look for yourself,
rip

This is better than Doctor Strange MOM

I watched all the marvel movies before this just because I wanted the experience so I could feel what everyone else felt but honestly now that I&#39;m at the movie that made me want to watch everything...girl, my heart is already too beaten down. Girl, I JUST finished watching Civil War....I can&#39;t even function...I just...man, lol, I hope I really love this movie because I&#39;m starting from a very bleak place . My chest hurts lol

I&#39;m kind of hoping Scott or Sam come back for the third film (most likely it&#39;ll be part of phase 6), I think both films are pretty great. Hopefully for the story will be a little more streamlined focusing on Doctor strange and Clea, possibly even having strange pass the torch.

One of the most underrated marvel films. Thought it was way better than the sequel.

He keeps getting better and multiverse of madness is proof😂😂😂

one of the best movie of mcu.

I think both films are pretty good but this one has a little more nuance and a much simpler story.

This movie is such a masterpiece when comparing it to Multiverse of Madness.

Woww...

Cool video!!!

Who&#39;s here after watching doctor strange 2

I&#39;m Here After Doctor Strange 2 And The Character Development Of Strange Is Still Consistent!!

“My Moms”😵‍💫 these woke ideologues are total LOONS… might as well be illiberal anti equality maniacal man haters. At least in the history of the “tyrannical male hierarchy” men never wanted to abolish women. If these ideologues had their way they’d wipe men off the face of earth. 😵‍💫🙄

I loved.{😍}
It is not trailer 2 it is trailer 1

Jesus saves❤️✝️
My favourite marvel movie

I looooove Strange!!!

In Sass&#39;sSdsswwqaew
Even today watching this 6 year old flim gives chills ; soundtrack , Jaw dropping visuals and Benedict as dr strange 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Nailed the character

“Shamballa” - Elizabeth Olsen, MOM Press Tour

Me

How to download this movie

He went from this to fighting Thanos and the Scatlet Witch, helping Spider-Man with a multiverse crisis and meeting Professor X and Mr Fantastic

So adoring💚
Cant wait

After MOM, this makes me appreciate this film even more. I loved this more than the sequel. This trailer&#39;s theme is also one of my favourites. Dystopia by Hi Finessse.

Movie for dummy people,like you people..!!!

HE WENT FROM “I CANT DO THIS” TO STANDING HIS GROUND AGAINST WANDA ACROSS THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS!!!

Just watching the trailer lowers IQ by 10 points . There is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie.

Dr Strange &gt;&gt;&gt; Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness

Wait for Doctor Strange 3 here

Better than Triverse of Midness

Finally

Still one of the best trailers of all time

I like this film, it's really great, MARVEl is really cool, greetings from me, Agus
Wish I could&#39;ve seen this but I wasn&#39;t on it at the time..

MCU SIP

The multiverse always stay in marvel we have a big suprise in doctor strange 2

Most beautiful movie this is 🙌

Who’s here before Multiverse of Madness

his best looks was his own movie 3&gt;

Doctor Strange was released in theaters on my second maternal uncle&#39;s birthday in 2016.

BEST MARVEL TRAILER OF ALL TIME

I really regret not seeing this at my movie theater. Watching it at home just doesn’t compare 😒

O you who have believed, do not let your wealth or your children distract you from the remembrance of God, and whoever does that - those are the losers.
Magic didn&#39;t begin with Thor. Magic began with Doctor Strange!So I guess. Either way, DS was awe-inspiring!

<a href="">1:38</a> &quot;I&#39;VE SPENT SO MANY YEARS PEERING THROUGH TIME... LOOKING FOR YOU.&quot; 🥶🥶🥶
I’m so glad to be alive and experience all of it. Multiverse of madness let’s goooo

Trailer looks nice. Second part of this movie will be madness...

Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man are gonna meet him one day….if I said that when this came out no way anyone would believe me

the tibetan monk here was make white instead of tibetan to appease the ccp. boycott this garbage marvel

This trailer is good, but multiverse of madness trailer is better since it constantly brings the excitement to wait the surprises to be revealed.

the guy from Fortnite

I thought this was a second trailer to Doctor strange multiverse of madness

Opening To Doctor Strange 2016 DVD

Bill Gates and Steve Jobs as healers is weird.

I love this movie so much, it might be one of my favourite MCU standalone movies. Benedict Cumberbatch nails it as Stephen Strange, the movie is so visually imaginative and the first glimpses of the multiverse are exciting as hell. Can&#39;t wait for Multiverse of Madness!

It&#39;s a joke the caption of this trailer and VERY  disturbing for disabled people!!!!

after seeing these marvel stuff, people just get into it so much that they forget to like

Who&#39;s watching the old trailers like me?

I’m still wondering why the movie isn’t called Mr Doctor

HOLY CRAP i forgot how awesome this trailer theme is

I wish the makers use this score in doctor strange 2

This trailer is immoral

Loki Finale ----} Doctor Strange 2
Sherlock vs Hannibal

Here after loki finale🤣🤣
Doc its your time now there are so many job you have to do 🤣 thanks to loki sylvie

i misread this as doctor strange 2 trailer and got hype but this is made me rewatch the first movie

Just for views like wtf

We expected someone to come with a cameo in WandaVision...

&quot;Mr....?DoctorMr Doctor??Its Strange...Maybe. But who am i to judge&quot;

Hannibal

terrible guy, he doesn’t know how to safsem ihrat, isho for azhyatazh with yyvo ralami? no mastery, no charisma, some kind of fatty khnom piridvikhatis ate, ate, what is squeaking terrible holas, it’s impossible to watch this crap. Baba Yvonaya is also a terrible khnomikha, the eyes are invisible, the hubs are like Ushtirlitsa. bisexual couple. The movie is complete crap. nothing. Why lie? simply spyorli other vozmozhnasti and loot and it’s inadvisable for us to fill in some special hands of the surgeon. like nipaydyosh to myediks adni nidauchki and charlatans. better smyerti assholes nakokye at home wait papivaya kapirinyu idaikiri cham give swayo tielo to these terrible machines. Tipier these nidauchki pirikqualifitsy fought with a wave. maha makhamyet ate his shtibllet. terrible smell of decomposition. sasniudzipkarnishon
Ooh I really wish along with Wanda loki would also be in this movie That would make it chaotic and mischief at the same time😍😍😍😍😍💥💥💥

I literally almost had a heart attack because i thought it said &quot;Doctor Strange 2 Trailer&quot; I almost died-

Not all heroes wear capes











Some wear cloaks
&quot;How long have you been in Kamar Taj, Mr...?&quot;

&quot;Doctor!&quot;...

&quot;Mr. Doctor?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s... Strange&quot;

&quot;Maybe, who am I to judge?&quot;

for a second i thought this is doctor strange 2 trailer

Doctor Strange2 coming out on 2022

Amazing how this movie became prophetic... The world is changing, and Beast is rising (in movie its &quot;durmammu&quot; &amp; invaders and its the byblical dragon IRL). As hopefully, the good forces are prepared.

This movie ruined my high and had me dozing off

This movie is boring and lame af!!! Go watch ant man instead

Heard this is a good movie to watch on lsd, let’s find out

Greatest MCU trailer of all time

Who here after Marvel announced to kill of Strange?Goodbye Dr.Strange........you will always be one of my favorite Superheroes......

&quot;A Sorcerer is a Wizard without a hat&quot;                                          -Captain America(new)(Sam Wilson) 2021

i just realized that anyone could just take the time stone from doc, go into space and use the time stone on earth and go back in time.

I want a doctor strange 2 trailer not doctor strange trailer 2

I love drax’s cameo in this

The actual real proof Doctor Strange can see the future... He wears a face mask

mystic arts

HE WAS MEANT TO BE THE BEST OF US

Doctor press Ctrl+Z and everything gets alright😅

after years, I still like the film &amp; its trailers. :)

This is the end. The Word Of God who dwelt amongst flesh is coming for His own people very soon Those who prepare for the return of Jesus Christ now, and seek a relationship with Jesus Christ, will not be disappointed in the near future. They will find themselves worthy for the rapture. The Greatest Event in Human History. They will be caught up to be with Jesus Christ on the clouds. All the innocent children of the world will also be taken during the rapture. Those left behind will experience the Great and Terrible Day of The Lord. Those who&#39;ve taken the Covid-19 vaccine have no more hope for salvation.Those who love Jesus Christ need to avoid the Covid-19 vaccine. Anyone who recieves the vaccine will find themselves outside the gates of heaven. They will be utterly rejected by God for destroying the image of God within them. Those who take the Covid-19 vaccine, are legally subjected to satan for all eternity. Do not take the vaccine, if you love Jesus Christ. I warm because I warn because I care with all my heart. I find no pleasure in the death of sinners.It&#39;s not God&#39;s will that anyone perish, but all repent to recieve eternal life. Jesus Christ loves everyone dearly. Please seek Him while the doors of mercy are still open. Those left behind, who haven&#39;t taken the Covid-19 vaccine, will have to die for their faith in Jesus Christ. This is the end, everything written in the book of revelation will be fulfilled.

This is a mixture of inception+Tenet+Harry Potter+Sherlock Holmes

This soundtrack haunting me for years. It&#39;s amazingly wonderfull, but I can&#39;t find it. Can I get any help PLEASE?

movie: doctor strangescene: nepalmovie: englishhero: dr strange
<b>Doc</b>

Oh come on this is the original movie not the second one

just watched it yesterday, i loved it.

The music is epic

Inception 2 👀
Can wait for Doctor Strange in the  Multiverse of Madness Trailer release

Inception : &quot;Is he with you? &quot;Tenet : &quot;I thought he was with you.&quot;

This is my favourite movie doctor strange and the sound track

Marvel certainly know how to make a good trailers

Trailer your head. This just dr strange clip.

Best marvel movie
This is the best marvel movie I&#39;ve seen, and I&#39;ve watched endgame...

I&#39;m just waiting for multiverse of madness&#39;s trailer 🥵

Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩❤

lmao i thought it said Doctor Strange 2 Official trailer

benedict cumberbatch fans hit a like here

This is dr strange 1 trailer not 2

&quot;Doctor Strange 2 Official Trailer&quot;Me: WHAT... oh

Pete&#39;s Dragon Suicide Squad Storks and Boo Madea 🎃AMC 🎭 and summer 2016 DVD&#39;s like Jungle Book and Beast 25th

&quot;Your WIFI Password&quot; still Cracks me up 😂

Benedict Cumberbatch literally looks comic accurate not only his costume but also his face

“What’s this? My Mantra?”

“The WiFi password... We’re not savages.”

You all may steal India&#39;s secret..But Father will always remain father

Search for &quot;Doctor Strange 2&quot; and im here ..

I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been waiting for four years

Do u get human chills with background music or are you normal

i just realized.... this movie was released the day after trump won

I THOUGHT IT SAID DOCTOR STRANGE 2 TRAILERRR AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA

plot twist: the ancient one was driving the other car

Gandalf : &quot;Is he with you? &quot;Harry Potter : &quot;I thought he was with you.&quot;

Sorcerer Supreme in his big screen debut
Click bait
This is so fake this ain’t doctor strange 2 them fakers

There is no other way by mordo same dialogue in infinity war by strange to tony : Tony there was no other way

POV: you think this trailer was doctor strange 2POV: you got click bait

Ancient One: How did you become a doctor?

Strange: Study practice , years a bit  that&#39;s the secret of Sherlock

When will we get the trailer for part 2??

Doctor Fate is coming 🧙‍♂️.
All I see is sherlock

Who came here after thinking it was Doctor Strange 2

One of the best Marvel movies ever and best movies of 2016.

This movie is underrated

In MCU, where Sherlock is a doctor and John is a CIA agent

Strange: How I go from here to thereAncient One: How did you become a doctorStrange: Study practice , years a bit Anciet One: that emotion

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness comes out exactly a year from now on March 25, 2022...

I&#39;ll come back here after a year.

“What’s this? My Mantra?” 

“The WiFi password... We’re not savages.”

Benedict Cumberbatch was made for this role

We should have a Dr Strange 2 🎞 🎥 already!!

The wifi password 🤣🤣
Doctor straaaaaange
is it just me or does Dr Strange have a bit of a weird head  seethrough glitch? <a href="">1:52</a> to <a href="">1:54</a>

Eagerly waiting for the sequel💞

A sorcerer is a wizard without hat...

Doctor strange when he realized that 15 year old kid going to finishes his trilogy before you get second part :(

Imagine if Joaquin Phoenix said yes to this role....

Cool

Plz plz give us just first look of Doctor Strange 2 🙏

The most underrated MC movie. Can&#39;t wait for the sequel... Doctor Strange is a complex character, his sarcasm has the roots in its intelligence and there&#39;s so much &#39;material&#39; that the screenwriters and the director can play with - hopefully they will know how to do it...

Damnit I thought this was the Doctor Strange 2 trailer. Read too fast

Imagine if Dr. Strange is a stand alone film and in the ending plot twist is that the ancient one put hallucinogen in his tea in the beginning.

<a href="">1:47</a> it gives me chills every time

We are waitin for Doctor Strange 2 Trailer

Dr Strange will be future tech for Power of subconcious mind and Silva Mind Control Techniques Like Iron man was future for tech like Android and ipads

It still looks so cool.

Doctor strange knew that corona was coming and just wear a mask to warn us

Who is here afterWho is here before Fcuk stop it

who else is watching after wandavision finale?

Anyone here after wanda vision

evil dude: i am death...*dramatic pause* pain!me: i am hungry
Who is here after last episode of Wanda vision. It is finally revealed who is stronger sorcerer.

I thought this was the trailer of doctor strange 2😭

too bad the ancient one is whitewashed

the visuals of this movie are severely underrated

Like Iron man was future for tech like Android and ipads, Dr Strange will be future tech for Power of subconcious mind and Silva Mind Control Techniques

the undertitles are a disgrace

&quot;Strange is meant to be the best of us&quot;

This is fake it’s just the last movie 😭

The greatest movie in the history of humanity

Doctor strange trailer: only 200k likesDoctor strange 2 trailer when released: 2MILLION LIKES

One of the best trailers ever made !

Okay i catch you watching this in 2021, why?

How did you become a doctor?Study and Practice.. Years of it

marvellous film i saw it
The most beautiful movie he had ever seen

it&#39;s a good thing dr strange became a superhero; his sterile technique is appalling

Doctor Strange movie is like Harry Potter and Inception

In 2021🔥😍
Yer a wizard, Stephen

Now waiting for 2

Waiting for movie

Just keep the number 2 after the word &#39;strange&#39; then you the title will be Doctor strange 2 official trailer😜

This is  Movie is  Still  amazing and Epic and  Soo I am Rewatching It  Tommrow  maybe

Hello to all the people here for GCSE Media

Multiverse of Madness hype is on

<a href="">1:18</a>I Amdeath

Because of the comics and cartoons this is one of the few marvel movies I really wanted to see because I love this character

when sherlock goes too deep in his mind palace

Wtf

My mind reading it <b>doctor strange 2 official trailer</b>

I’ve seen this movie sooooooo many times (it’s truly pathetic), but this is my first time watching the trailer 👁👄👁

My god this trailer was one of the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The first movie with a new Marvel Studios logo added with its’ customary movie themed design and animation ❤️❤️

For a moment , i thought that marvel released dr strange 2 trailer

Love BC

This Movie is Underrated!

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is my most anticipated movie!

Doctor stranger 1
Bro i honestly think Strange could beat Thanos

I can't find the movie, I only watch trailers.
A petition for Cumberbatch&#39;s Doctor Strange to become the lead force of the MCU after RDJ&#39;s Iron-ManAnother petition for Holland&#39;s Spider-Man to become the leader of the Young Avengers

I come here time and again for the background music 😂 its so hypnotic

Rachels is back

I love marvels and avengers movies Who think thanos is best villian Like here

Weezer
Don't pay attention, it's a pure scam, just release the trailers, you're horrible.
My favourite ❤️ Dr.strange
Tell me why I thought that said Dr Strange 2. Huuuuuuuhhhhhh its been a long day for me 😞😞😞😞

I hope in part two tobey macquire will come back

The Music Is   FRICKEN AMAZING That&#39;s  Why I am  Using it

Youtube suggesting after 4 years 👏👏👋

Dystopian Music gives goosebumps everytime

Excellent shooting in Nepal
I thought this was the second movie trailer 🙄

You so

Today I just waake up and opened yt then this trailer was recomended. I&#39;m shock because I read it cuickly as Doctor Strange 2

Probably the worst marvel movie.

Thought this was the trailer for &quot;Doctor Strange 2&quot;

Kind of reminds me of the Matrix

The tinkle starting sound is pretty common in all marvel studios trailers

I thought it said- Doctor Strange 2 official trailer

When you find out the reality you live in has dumbasses that take movie clips to make a trailer 🤣🤣

I could have swore this was 2017 movie wow

Don&#39;t like every movie in the MCU but this film is one of my favourites.Very underappreciated.I certainly can&#39;t wait to see more of that darker mystical supernatural side of Marvel ( Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Blade, Hellstorm, Morbius, Mephisto. )since this was just the tip of the iceberg.

This is one of the most underrated MCU movies. But honestly this is a incredible movie with so much attention to detail I can watch this movie so many times and not dread nor dislike it shout-out Benedict and the other cast members for making such a great movie💯

While filming, Benedict Cumberbatch walked into a comic book store, in full costume, and bought an actual Doctor Strange comic.

Ok so I just read the title incorrectly and was fooled into watching the entire trailer in the hope that they&#39;re just giving a glimpse into doctor strange 1🤦🏻‍♀️

If he could see the future, he should have known that Endgame was coming the moment he inherited the time stone.

God dammit! This randomly popping up in my recommended I thought this said Doctor Strange 2 Trailer.

Still one of my favourite movies to this day..

<a href="">0:08</a> - in the movie he was just walking not drinking wine 😂 exactly pause there

Dr strange is going to join spiderman 3

Title : Dr. Strange Official Trailer 2My eyes : Dr. Strange 2 Official Trailer
Frankly speaking, the film is amazing in every sense of the word, but the problem is that there is no second part
Who’s here after hearing doctor strange is gonna be in mcu Spider-Man 3?

Still my favorite MCU origin movie!!
Fake

I prefer sherlock 100% better than this

Good movie.

Anybody else here because Doctor strange is going to appear in spider man 3?

My favourite mov3

Proud to be Nepali🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵

I love marvel
Best movie to see in IMAX 3D

Dr strange is stronger than Captain marvel fight me

dubbing is bad in almost many countries in change of language. Just take an exampleWhat&#39;s thisWi-Fi password we are not savages but in hindi it&#39;s (I am translating to english) Wifi password I also purchase some things online. 🤨🤨🤨🤨🧐🧐😒😒😒

i

Wow nice trailer I watched it after movie seems better than movie ❤️❤️❤️
He was just come for bargain.

It feels so good to know that they have mentioned Kathmandu and Nepal in this movie,so much excited for multiverse of madness

Year

Mister Doctor will now be seeing you today.

i loved that Lamborghini :&#39;(

The guy who composed the music in this trailer deserves a raise.

Love from nepal ...love to see places of nepal😍

Full movie

This is a revelation hidden and this WiFi password scene just covered up 3,000+ years of powerful secret ancient knowledge which was being explained prior to it.

🔮Google: Siddhi🔮
🔮Hidden in plain sight🔮
I don&#39;t know why Benedict&#39;s name hasn&#39;t ever come up when the Doctor Who&#39;s Series Regeneration is imminent. I think he&#39;d make an amazing Doctor. :-)

Ye poorana trailer hai

So you actually thought that this was Dr Strange 2 while scrolling down huh?!

Let&#39;s be honest you thought it was the 2nd movie of Doctor Strange, right?

One of the best movie of MCU.

Well looks like Sherlock and Irene Adler managed to sneak out in a separate Multiverse!!!

In my most humble opinion, this is one of the best MCU trailers.

There should be solo movie of Dr. Fate

They should have kept this theme music. The one they used in the movie is just a rehash of that composers Star Trek theme and not a good fit either.

I thought this was the second part of the movie trailer 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂

Still in my top 5 marvel movies

Man, I loved Bernardsdick Cabbagepatch&#39;s acting in this movie

Who are all thought that it is doctor strange 2 official trailer?

I&#39;m die hard DC fan but Dr.Strange is the only reason i love and respect Marvel.

in 2020 I come here to watch Doctor Strange Trailer.

Coincidentally it&#39;s Sherlock and Irene Adler!! 😊

I think they put a lot of effects while making the movie

Sher lock sheris acter

Hey they changed the Marvel Studios logo 😎.........

Proud seeing the Nepalese architecture 🤩🤩😎

Are these true in real life??

What are you doing Sherlock

No one knows that dormammu is also played by dr strange

Didn&#39;t like the film,but I adore the trailer. Especially <a href="">0:27</a>. When that music drops 🤤

In the trailer Mordo said There is no other way, in infinity war Doctor Strange said there was no other way 😱

anyone here after endgame
Everything is INCEPTION.

I don&#39;t know why YouTube recommend this trailer today, July 30, 2020. 😅

So this is where sherlock holmes went to

I am from Nepal. Namaste

This one of my favourite movies ever. It gives us a full origin story and explores the characters humanity

No matter how much I try I always see him as Sherlock irrespective of whatever character he is playing 😐.

what if nolan make a doctor strange movie

<a href="">0:06</a> - actually that scene didn&#39;t come in the movie

Imagine Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Who......

Dr Strange really underrated character. Marvel made him weak in endgame. whereas he brought an army. a lot has happened thanks to him. He&#39;s 2nd Tony Stark .

Where is Wanda????

This movie goosebumps awesomeWhn will release part 2

Basically this film reminds me of Inception even though the comics were first

I&#39;m so excited
Literally the first movie

This is fan made???? Or no

plzz mujhe btade k hm freelancers kese move on kren hm n skills to seekhli pr ab smjh nhi aaraha kia kren fiverr to poori zindagi khtm k baad hi hme rank dega

Brother, what rank did you give me?
Any comic book readers remember that Doc Strange started The Defenders. The biggest fight was 6 Finger Hand. The Avengers sidelined it.

No no movie
2020✊✌
Spoiler Tobey Maguire is in the next Doctor Strange playin as spider-man 😁 my fav

I&#39;m big fan of marvel ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love from afghanistan 😊
<a href="">2:05</a>

<a href="">1:48</a> this scene screamsMCU&#39;s strongest hero has arrived

This is what Sherlock was doing while he was pretending to be dead

Doctor Strange

Mister Doctor: Into the multiverse of madness

When I saw doctor strange I was devastated to find out that Padme cheated on Anakin

I got this recommended and I actually thought it was the trailer for the second movie🤦‍♂️

Love from Nepal

Are the sealab people involved?

Kaecilius and his followers disliked the video

Cool cloak

AMAZİNG
Hi

SHERLOCK !!

Love from Nepal ♥️♥️
This breaks my brain and reality

He is just harry potter acting as doctor strange!💁

Did you notice him saying &quot; There was no other way &quot; to strange

SUP?

Mads Mikkelsen the BEST!

Anyone who has visited Kamataj in Nepal ?

Sam Raimi&#39;s movie may be Toby Return (Spider Man)

The movie that made me appreciate the beauty of IMAX

How many of you are waiting for Doctor strange 2??...

wifi password😂😂😂😂
<a href="">1:30</a> duuuuude
Is that Wong his fateful servant?

Why did I go “woah it’s Sherlock!” 🤣
What’s up with Rachel having this obsession with Sherlocks

Kinda cool how a channel gets so many subs by just making trailers.

Doctor Strange will always be the best solo movie of MCU and you can&#39;t change my mind.

What a trailer.. What a movie ✌

If I could be any avenger I would be tony stark or doctor strange

Basically an ad for astral projection....

He&#39;s the strongest avenger stronger then captain marvel fight me

Is iron man in this film

One of the best favorite movie in my life💕💞💞

He saw 14million possibilities but he didn&#39;t warn us about carona Virus🙄

Nepali blood xam
Can you please make a movie of the sorcerer supreme? It really makes me sad to know that she died on this movie &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. I like the Sorcerer Supreme more that i like doctor strange. She&#39;s really cool.

Hola

Nepal ma shoot vako raichha ta

Shambala, is mentioned in the Hindu mythology, it&#39;s the birthplace if Vishnu&#39;s last avatar, kalki

Who&#39;s ready for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness!!!!!😀

Did anybody else notice that they never showed Dormammu in this trailer?

U didn&#39;t mention about lockdown, not fare strange

ConstantineHoth

My favorite Avenger. Benedict Cumberbatch really fits the role ❤ waiting for Doctor Strange 2 😊😊😊.

Saw this in Lima, Peru in 2016. Amazing movie &lt;3

timadoressssssssssssssssssssssssss

as if i could see sherlock holmes, irene adler from another universe and hannibal lecter in one movie together and not laugh the whole time ksjhfjfhd

Some people stop watching the trailers...But not us.

How many Of You Noticed The Name Of the Place Called As         <b>Shamballa</b>(that is The Holy place., in That Place .. the 10th Avatar of lord vishnu Is Going To Happen..😲😲)

The only doctor who can save us from Corona Virus 🤣

How is having a mantra &quot;savage&quot; like?

The ancient one should get her own film.

SERLOCK HOLMES

Waiting for doctor strange madness of multiveres

Underated movie because of shitty fans

So nobody talking about how bomb Benadryl Cucumberpatch looks with that black hair and french beard?

This isn&#39;t Doctor Strange 2 ! This is the first movie, Doctor Strange 1

Doctor strange fist hai
I wonder how earth looks like now!

Seriously, why are they taking so long with movie 2

BREAKING NEWS: Sam Raimi will directed Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness

Doctor StrangeRelease date: November 4, 2016Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of MadnessRelease date: May 7, 2021

Who&#39;s here for the sequel of Doctor Strange!

This is so evil.

I wish Mordo became Doctor Strange&#39;s pal in Infinity War, Wong was just some grumpy librarian but Mordo was his friend this whole movie

PITBULL

JARED LENTO TOMCRUISE =))

This case is difficult--- CRIS EVAN
It&#39;s totally copy of Hinduism here Shambhala is a place where kalki avatar will born in future at the end of Kalyug...

Best Avenger is Caption America and Thor &amp; Iron man

The qualities of drama, but also great humor amongst that profundity and oddness, and unique weirdness and newness that they are gonna bring visually, put the hero thing on the back burner.

This is one of the coolest movies and trailers I&#39;ve seen this movie made me love dr strange he is highly underrated this movie made me read his comics

This is the movie that had my favourite character development and the final message. Awesome

This movie made me fall in love with MArvel.

Plissss @MCU make film about The ancient one

Can’t wait for doctor strange 2

I don’t think I’ve ever been so impressed with a trailer before. I regret not having watched it in theatre but definitely will on the VR headset!

Its 2020! Still cooooooolll.....🥶🥶🔥🔥🔥
Doctor Strange  is my favourite movie,  and  don&#39;t loose Doctor Starenge 2:  In the Multiverse Of Madness my don&#39;t release yet but i sense my favourite because all of these multiverse think i like it very much thanks Marvel Studios for these movies that we bringing us and thanks for the movies that we will bringing us in to the fuure whitch Doctor Strange 2 and  Thor 4:  Love and Thunder

İt is fake.

Dr Strange like job Mage in Rpg Game

U need to agree... Half of this trailer if from doctor strange part 1.

just Iron man

I’m too poor to watch every avenger movies there are like 10 movies to watch for me and in 2021 will be like another 10 movies like 😳 my money

🔥  Love this movie.  <a href="">1:50</a> 🎥🔥   👇 👇 👇💚
is that jessica chastain or jeniffer garner or rachel mcadams..they all look alike

After this film, I fell in love with this character. Doctor Strange became one of my favorite Avengers.

It would seem more appropriate that the Sorcerer Supreme would have the Reality Gem in general, but I understand why they went with Time for the purpose of the story in this and other MCU films.

Who else clicked on this thinking it said Doctor Strange 2 Official Trailer

Came for doctor stang
this movie is sooooo underated

Who thought just by the thumbnail this video was doctor strange 2?

Very good

<del>----H---E---L----L----O--</del>

DR STRANGE literally my most favorite character in rhe MCU. he&#39;s technically on my number 1 list

I had a serious crush on him after watching this

The real mvp of Infinity war! 😅😅

So underrated

This November it will have been four years since this movie was released...

Do they support crime and violence and still think the universe is natural? Injustice there! Marvel is a fraud! That's right!
Woah!Some parts of the movie was shoot in my country (Nepal)

This movie is SOOOO deep

Best Movie EVER
Is it just me or do I want to see if he has abs…

i am doctor strange [ snap ]
I want him to be my husband

I can’t do t
I was one of the lucky thousands to witness this trailer at SDCC 2016 and i gotta tell you.. the hype was REAL!!! The music, the acting, the magic, everything about this movie got me pumped!!! and now since the movie came out, this trailer still gives me goosebumps!! 😍😍😍

Strange Doctor is the only one who can defeat Thanos on his own time stone
I thought this said doctor strange 2

....How did you become a doctor?...&quot;study and practice&quot;...

I came a long way...

Who is here after endgame .

I clicked &quot;Doctor strange 2 official trailer&quot; but no,,this is different.

Still feels like yesterday. There was no other good movie release that week so me and my friends just went to see it just to pass some time. But here we  were screaming and hooting mindlessly while watching it.

Certainly the 2nd best origin story film within the MCU after Captain America the first Avenger.

Great trailer - suuuuuch a bad film

Still watching it because of the music 😅

Waiting for the second movie

Where is Sherlock in this movie

He is still searching for his BB...

The hairs at the back of my neck are standing after seeing this.Epic😍

For me this will be the best MCU movie ever, even after Endgame.

Why did I thought this was doctor strange 2 trailer😴

I thought this is the Doctor Strange 2 trailer.

How did you become a doctor..... Study and practice

Yo Hannibal was in this nice

Doctor Strange is the best Doctor Strange and the madness of multiverse:hold my wifi password

My trailer is still giving me chills

disneycember sent me
Waiting for the second one
Everyone says Thor, Iron man, Captain Marvel, etc., but this man fights with non-physical things if they saw the comics they would know that he is extraordinary and that in the movies they do not show everything.

Seems like a long time ago

If you guys are curious what comments were written before the newer ones, well people years ago were having a theory that Strange may have the Time Stone and turned out it&#39;s true.

Dr. Strange is Kalki of marvel

Just came here for <a href="">1:46</a> 🙆

Hello Shindu, this is me
I love coming back to this. Reminiscing on how I felt, the excitement, the curiosity, the amazement I felt.I remember the music in the beginning fitting soo well with the mysticism that is Dr. Strange.This was a great movie, and I absolutely cannot wait for Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

Who else waiting for dr.stange 2 ?

can I use this video? for school wok purposes only thank you :)

I went to see this movie while high back when it came out and man what an experience. One of my favorite Marvel movies. Changed my life.

This is a seriously underrated marvel movie

Bargain, I&#39;ve come to Dormammu....

Anyone After Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness ???!!!

VERY GOOD 👍👍👍👍👍

It&#39;s been 3 years since this movie came out. Time flies! I miss the time when I watched this film for the first time. It was pretty good.

When your life is at this point... ❤❤

Why does this movie feel like it came out 8 years ago? It feels so long since the start of Phase 3

<a href="">0:27</a>

Tony: Why?Strange: Because we need more movies

I recently changed my WiFi password to &#39;shamballa&#39;.

Can wait to see Multiverse of Madness

Imagine if some-one else got the role of dr.strangeedit: same, i can’t imagine either

SI ES LA 1 LA PRIMERA PELICULA 1

Who r those 8k idiots who disliked this trailer ? Go get a life 😡

I love his power so elegant and discret... Interesting

This is still one of the dopest trailers ive ever seen

Me watching the first trailer: I bet this’ll be an awesome MCU film! Me watching the second trailer: Were the creators on drugs?Me watching the movie: Nope, /I’m/ on drugs.

At first I thought this was doctor strange part 2

Proud to be an Hindu..💪👈

There making a 2nd movie but this is not the trailer this is the 1st one

This is not the new one, it&#39;s old one.

Awesome! I loved the movie&#39;s ambient, it truly takes me out of this world. I hope the sequel  have a similar feeling with more practical effects👍🏻

The most super powerful avenger. ...•••••••Scarlet Witch 😈😈
the film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe is just fire, I wish everyone to see the graphics, the acting is just fine.

that too bad

Shambhala
There is/was no other way, so Strange stole Mordo&#39;s line.

I am sorry Tony... there was no other way.

FAKEEEEEEEE

<b>Doctor strange movie &amp; STORY Different compared to Remaining MCU movies</b> 😂😂😂

Did Dr.Strange got power coming to Nepal?

I am from Nepal that means I too can have that power hummm.

SOOOO hyped for Multiverse of madness 😍😍😍😍❤️
Just came into my recommendations, thought it was for Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness 😭😭😭

CANT WAIT DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS

Now he doing for living?

I don&#39;t know when Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness is coming out, but I can&#39;t find 1 real Trailer that shows it. My guess is 1- Their building the hype after making so much $$$$$ from End Game. 2- They just don&#39;t have enough film in the can to make a trailer. One thing seems to be certain. It&#39;s defiantly coming out next summer or the following summer (It&#39;s gotta be a summer release to get the high Box Office sales). Either way, I&#39;m looking forward to it.. :)

<a href="">1:47</a> HOLYYYYYYYYYYY

This is more like Doctor Strange 1 trailer

CHOOSE THIS GUY IN USA. LIKE BLOOD TRANSFER/ DONATION I DID COUPLE OF TIMES, I M TRANSFERRING EVERYTHING I HAVE TO A &quot;BOY IN USA&quot;. HOPE MY MEN PICKS UP THE RIGHT ONE. I DONT WANT TO LIVE A LIFE &quot;WHERE I M CAUGHT N SURROUNDED&quot;. NOPE NEVER AGAIN.I JUST WANT PEACE IN MY PERSONAL LIFE IN THE TREES IN THE MOUNTAINS N LOTS OF ROCKS. HAHA JUST JOKING.

I don't understand English 😭
Can we mention how epic the soundtrack in this trailer is?!

Doctor Strange 2 pleaseee!!!

its fan made

Still my favourite trailer

I love this trailer

I mistook this trailer as doctor strange 2

This has always been one of my favorites. Cannot wait for the sequel!!

The guy who saw endgame before anybody else. But didn&#39;t spoiled a bit.

Ye avengers movies ke Pandit g hain Jo sabka bhavishya batate hain

btchhhhh!!! i thought this is a  trailer for Doctor Strange 2 because it is on my recommendation. i read again, it&#39;s Doctor Strange Trailer 2. tf!!! 😂😭😭😭😂

When I saw the trailer it felt like 2018 not 2016 bro wtf my sister was not 1 yr old when I saw this trailer

Anybody realize that after Endgame, Doctor Strange will not have a Time Stone...&quot;Our oath to protect the stone doesn&#39;t change&quot;

So Ready For The Sequel And Hulk Better Be In It Or Scarlet Witch One Of The 2!!!

where cumberbitches at?

The best movie.... Dr. Strange
It&#39;s my fav character

Wow Regina George helps other now, that’s great.

The only serious movie that Marvel has, love Dr Strange!

In this trailer there is something wrong in these scene. Doctor strange is doing a surgery and scrubs his hand and then puts his mask. That is wrong. You cannot put mask after you scrub your hands. You have to put your mask before scrubbing or somebody puts on your mask. Mask are not sterile.

&quot;Dr. Strange you think you know how the world works, what if I told you the reality you know is one of many&quot;...Dr. Strange: this doesn&#39;t make any senseSS: &quot;Not everything does, not everything has too&quot;❤️

Says we are not savages but gave the most Savage reply as wifi password.

Who else clicked on this video thinking they were gonna watch the sequel for doctor strange?

“Dormammu, I’ve come to bargain”

&quot;There was no other way&quot;

Is this movie any good ? I&#39;m debating on watching it

<a href="">0:27</a> why this is not in the movie?

“I can’t do this” *Some time later*trys to kill thanos

of all the scenes in this trailer, and marvel chose the current thumbnail....

This movie is sooo darn underrated. Benedict’s performance, the visual effects, the set pieces and action scenes...superb movie. Saw it a few days ago and fell in love with it.

This is doctor strange 1

2016: dont now...2017: not yet....2018: wait hold up...2019: have you seen dr strange trailer???

Best origin ever
That is the white witch in Narnia

I’ve never seen him in normal clothes

That is doctor strange 1 trailer

Don't let it fool you, it's number 1
Who comes after the endgame ✌️✌️

This was the first time Marvel showed the new Marvel logo - in this trailer.
