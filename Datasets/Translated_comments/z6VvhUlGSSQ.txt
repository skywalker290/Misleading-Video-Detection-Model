Hinduphobia is rampant in Bollywood movies.
your voice sir
I&#39;m already enraged

The word cringe is discovered only after tiktok

We often watch to those old 80s and 90s movies just to understand how dumb we were then ‍️‍️‍️.. now when kids watch these movies with us they  just dismiss the fact that we ever had a childhood of our own .... Our reality is their pun 

ohh god :/ that was painful to watch bruh

Yaar, why should you make a girl friend if you can't even kiss?
Now I know what&#39;s the reason behind our parents being the way they are

Jimmy I like your work and reviews....but smell too much feminine energy instead of masculinity from your POV.

I am unable to understand what was wrong with the last movie scene, which you talked about. What the male actor said in it, is correct in toto   though he should not say her &quot;whore&quot; but else it is not objectionable

two brothers in hindi
Dumbest video ever
If that last happened in real life today , a girl would file assault case on him .. I know he didn’t want her to kiss him but he could’ve handled the situation more sensitively knowing she had feelings for him . Majority of Indian girls in 90s dressed in western clothes were judged badly by being called lose character .

Your videos male me feel like i should go and read be my strength again . Its an amazing novel

Apparently these films shaped our parents&#39;generation. No doubt they are toxic.

Yuck!!!

Highest grossing of 1985 was not Mard, it was Ram Teri Ganga Maili

Every young generation find old generation stuffs weird, cringe.... Future generation will find our generation and your vdos weird and cringe

You could have reduced your ....recording a little

I don&#39;t know... Whether these actors ever repent for doing such film... Like yuck

you literally made a channel on bollywood  matlab kuch bhi 

Thumbnail wala to add hi nahi kia
Aahaa... i get what you did there &quot;aka&quot;

Agreed this was cringe but don&#39;t become snowflakes

That dudh was complete nonsense yrrr ...I mean such idiotic scenes!

What was wrong with the last video?

Not a what&#39;s app university graduater<a href=""> 4 : Roasting of Andh bhakts feat Sonu Nigam , Sambit Patra , Kapil Mishra , Ramdas Athawale...Like and do share 🇮🇳🇮🇳

I saw hero number 1 today

Brother, make your voice informal and humorous..It looks formal in your voice and funny dialogues on your voice.Very boring. It's my suggestion.
Doodh's extra money will go away.
Are you same guy with that chess channel?

These were the &quot;sanskaari&quot; films of the older times.. Smh.

Your voice at <a href="">2:35</a>
Doodh doodh doodh 

So called Sanskaari Indians. Murkh
<a href="">4:55</a> lucky gadhaShe loves you idiot, that&#39;s what she wanted to prove

I won&#39;t blv No boy i do blv
Indians

An entire generation of Indian kids grew up watching all these movies especially in the small towns and villages, with no one to look upto for any sort of moral education. Then these kids went on study and get jobs all over the nation with a crooked mindset that is projected in these movies. I know this better because I am from this generation. I strongly believe that entertainment industry carries a substantial amount of burden of the crime against women that is so obvious in our society today. Sadly even today Bollywood in most cases can&#39;t even explain the simple idea of consent both from male and female protagonist. Maybe it needs another generation for the film industry to actually take up the mantle of social responsibility.

Your English is excellent and simple.

So I decided to read Mendhi’s plot. I hated her previous movie, but this one was meh. She got revenge on her husband. You forgot to add he had planned to cheat on her cause he went to brothels, hence why he was thrown into jail because a problem arouse. But then he dies at the end, and his family beg for forgiveness. She should have left them, and found another man. Bollywood doesn’t realize how much it has an influence to not just young children, but also to adults and it disgusts me with the movies it chooses to portray out there. Maybe an intelligent person will know what’s right or wrong, but one in poverty is influenced by these movies and accepts it’s normal for these actions to happen regardless if female or male.

Dud dud...
In this movie at the time stamp of 20 minutes there is such an embarrassing scene in which everyone praises the actor and even actress changed herself.  name: virasat ki Jung.<a href="">#tried</a> and refused productions

Dudududududu lol
I have no objection on the last scene

First time heard u speaking hindi
I love your voice 
@Jammy, Farishtey (1991) was desi remake of Clint Eastwood&#39;s Hollywood movie Where Eagles Dare (1968).

I remembered in my childhood Dhara Singh scene was told geeatly

Doodh scene...???
Dharmendra
Fazool video

Illogical films money minded stars foolish common people

To be honest, i kind of cried for Rani Mukherji in Mehandi movie; that&#39;s because i watched it with my mom..., and she gets too emotional with such over-dramatic movies.

I am not surprised by the mentality of Indian audiences. All thanks to fucking Bollywood.

Wow I never watched these films n those filthy serials which can make u feel embarrassed that u live in India ... omg u r damn good boss !!!!

Enjoyable video...and very accurate.The most disgusting was “doodh”... how did Vinod Khanna ever agree to do such a character? Ewww!If you want to get on the topic of sexism in Bollywood, you would require a whole other youtube channel. I can’t even begin to name the ways how women in Bollywood are exploited, abused, seen as liabilities (rather than assets like the male actors) and then forced into retirement just because they cross a certain age or choose to get married and/or have families. I won’t start ranting here (because I could go on all day ha) but please tell me why Akshay, Salman, SRK, and other actors 50 and up are STILL paired with actresses young enough to biologically be their daughters...while the actresses who are in their 40’s get no work (unless they play a bhabi or mom of a grown child). Double standard doesn’t even begin to describe the hot mess that is Bollywood!

ohmygod that doodh doodh one was so disgusting!!!!

It is very sad to watch content  degrading women and destroying grace of females.

Doooodh Doooodh Doooodh Doooodh Doooodh Doooodh Doooodh
Can you talk about the movie Lajja starring Rekha.... Good and bad

There are lots more you can make a movie out of it

ur voice is more amazing when u speak in hindi

My mom: What are these movies? This happened to movies in our time! Movies in her era:
This time you could not show anything special.
Indra gandhi airport per nahi kana hahaha
Bro you should watch these shitty movies in 2x speed

Your voice is very sweet like always

Vinod Khanna should have just said no

Dho..dhoo..dhooo..dhoo....Dho..dhoo..dhooo..dhoo..lol.legend Vinod Khanna
Try something on latest reality shows...they are certainly horrendous but full of content for u.

90s Bollywood movies are reason we are fucked up

Sabka baap in each filmi field is Kanti-Shah ️

Doodh nahi tu moot pi le
You make this sound like this is a surprise. Our backwardness is on full display. You will be talking about todays bollywood movies being exactly that stupid 10-20 years from now. Yet the millions go in with their mouths agape at this substandard low brow piece of trash movie factory

Slapping a women is loving caring by a manIt’s a message of these film.disgusting!!!!

Is this too much? Don't even try to fly out of Indra Gandhi airport.
OMG ???
My favorite part - Ur cute pic at last! 

This guy is so cute

Kooch too?
The last clip was very interesting

Someone please give us some milk to drink, darling.
I really like the content please please please change the voice over artist..

I am from South India.. your channel is very entertaining

Fuck the stupidest sceneLast scene was extremely  disappointing fucked.

of english. olaad
Matlab kuchhhhh bhi ho gaya  love your accent
Lol

Mard...all time best movie..
The thing is that Bollywood was always crap ! Let it be 70s,80s,90s,2000s,2010s or much present late 2010s,because movies like gully boy did make me cringe! And &quot;apna time ayega &quot; what does it even want to teach us? It has got such immature lyrics and low bass that what to say? I can rap much better! Till date I can find only a few movies like Roja,dil se,Sathiya,kaal,om shanti om , Sawariya,little of race,azab prem ki gazab kahani!

Bakchodi bollywood movies
And here in 2019, I am wondering why the hell People have patriarchy ingrained in their heads in such a way that they consider themselves righteous as they go publicly telling women what they should do and wear. Bollywood is what happened to my parent’s generation.

Last clip, she earned that slap kissing such an A**hole. I also can&#39;t remember the name but Dharmendra and Anita Raj, in one of there movie she is a police officer who tries to stop illegal liquor shop and the gunda snatches her pistol and starts undressing her and she is stands straight giving expressions while Dharmendra saves the day. Feel so nauseated.

During my childhood i don&#39;t know what I&#39;m subjected to...ohh boy so much shit (bollywood) we all swim through

After seeing the du du dudh situation..... <a href="">#vomit</a>

When I was watching Faristay..I loved this movie but when the scene come..I was like oh shittt

Why always Mithun 

Bollywood&#39;s logic &quot;we will get investors to spend 1 million and hopefully we will make 10 million. If not then fuck it we got a few songs for the movie and hopefully that can slowly bring more income over time&quot; you can tell from the quality film of the 90s movies the budget is not there. You got movies from 1994 looking like a 1982 reel. Bollywood has always been a decade back when it comes to filming. It&#39;s only recently where film quality has improved to stick to today&#39;s times but Bollywood has always been bizzarre for releasing 80s movies looking like 70s movies and 90s movies looking like 80s movies.

Why this chutiya give so much commentry? Sikply show the video n then little of your gyaan

Please play longer video clips

Whenever there is such an Indira Gandhi, try to do B mat karna.. Udke niloge 
You you you you
Vinod Khanna was sex addict in real life

Mehndi was sooo depressing.

Omg you are really handsome 
matlab kuch bhi will last forever ..thanks to our old bollywood movies

Urr k niklo gethat bit ....

It&#39;s not the filmmakers fault !!These bullshit movies were hits or big earners    So obviously the standard of viewership is definitely in question

<a href="">4:58</a> was indeed good and correct statement

From today onwards I swore I would never watch movies again.
What English, baah baah baah
Yaaar the way u say &quot;Matlab kuch bhi&quot; is the cutest ️

<a href="">2:35</a> Parr yeh MATLAB KUUUCCH BI HO GYA..That voice of yours has stolen my heart okayyy

Vinod wala is so cheap

Sexist shit in India still continues :) INDIA NEEDS FEMINISM

I just love your page.. so genuine with really stunning focus on films and things we saw and never thought of.. and the sexy awaaaz of the narrator

Heyy i used to like ur voice and ur channel also but now after watching u i must say u r goood enough tooo.

Amul left the chat!!!

In the last scene,the guy slapping dat girl is certainly debatable....but the message is not!..the guy likes women who are modest, what&#39;s wrong wid dat.  ...if it had been him kissing the girl forcibly,then he wld have supposedly commited blasphemy and sexual assault...but not the other way around?...what was offensive and sexist in his dialogue...???..

You people don&#39;t understand that in the 90&#39;s there were no smart phones and mobile internet so people could easily watch whatever they want anywhere. People looked up at movies for adult entertainment. The filmmakers knew that that would justify some of the movies mentioned above. Nothing horrendous in the movie mehndi either. It was probably the first movie which showed that the rape victim should be married to the rapist. This kind of justice makes sense. And the last movie which you are talking about. No problem at all. I would myself slap a girl who kisses me publically who is not even my girlfriend. So a big dislike to your video.

WTF was the last dialogue?

Abe show me the video
Last 2 movies didn&#39;t deserve to be in the list.Don&#39;t be too modern,unless u live in US.Worst comment for last scene, i completely agree with hero on that ..Don&#39;t spread that girls should be too much nasty culture and say it modern

I have wasted my 3 minutes on this bullshit....

Good to see all this. . . Good to talk about chivalry, women rights, women&#39;s self-respect (which you do in your maximum videos) but trust me, even educated guys in today&#39;s generation have such low mentality.

Dudhdudhdudh.......
Omg the last scene lol

Hey, if you are a boy, then at least talk about men's rights, because of you there is no law for men in the country. Sometimes you also talk about the rights of men and responsibilities of women.
Right from our first film, we were showing pure bullshit.Satyajit Ray the mental to impress westerns Will show poverty. So cracks every where.

Dude, I love your voice bro..  One of the reasons why I keep watching your videos. 

And now women mastrubate on screen. Nothing has changed for women in the movie industry. They just make things look a lot cooler than the 90&#39;s.

Brother, if you say even a little, it seems very cheap...please don't say anything...
the voice over is extremely irritating....feminish voice..his way of speeking is very bad.

What is Dudu Dudu bachcha hai, what is the gay scene flop hua hoga shayadh
I’m just here to laugh and feel cringe all at the same time 

Should stop the intro, cause its irritating..

Seriously I have gone to disturbed after watching vinod khanna like dis has the director gone mad or he is also like this how disgusting &amp;how vinod khanna can accept to act like this it&#39;s to filthy

Kinda over reacting to some of well scripted dialogues That aren&#39;t too offensive and perfectly fits to the demand of the script

Our Bollywood is much aware that we have crores of fools hence they did produce such movies and they succeeded as well

I switch to your channel just to listen your English( )

Only one word after watching the &quot;Doodh...doodh&quot; scene.....Cringe cringe cringe.....

Love it! 

Urr ke niloge 
<b>If a girl is daring enough to kiss me in public, I will definitely marry her!</b>

Hey.....Did u watch each n every film of 90 &#39;s to run this production...??

hey god
Doodh

Love your all videos
<a href="">  ................... at <a href="">40:17</a>..

You have an underrated channel dude...

80s and early 90s films were mostly overrated and idiotic with some exceptions, can’t believe Bollywood went from Dilip Kumar , Raj Kapoor , and Dev Anand to that garbage

Doodh everywhere

Doo doo doo doodh.....
This is why I love Bollywood movies  but jokes apart some movies are really good. Especially now I think Bollywood is getting better at scripts and story lines.

Bro you are wasting our time, without watching these films we all knows that these are worthless

Intro music
You are just paranoid bro. Relax take it in artistic sense. You&#39;re just taking about one side of the coin. These films and dialogues had been buried from when ...

Bollywood is still a shit..... forget 80s and 90s... even in 2018  it still make shit movie....

umm.. the plane scene you show from mard is in fact logically sound so no you wouldn&#39;t fly off - it shows a small engine plane not a commercial jet  and the lasso holds on from the tail - around a pole and then held by Dara singh - the rope around the pole is what gives it logic - I mean you can try this with a small car with the same effect - in fact, it&#39;s possible for a strong man like the great khali to pull the plane back without the rope around a pole given that the plane has only  just begun moving and hasn&#39;t gained momentum already so that&#39;s not laughable.

Brother, please speak in Hindi also.
You are always against 90s

Amazing knowledge

Jammy, the leading hardcore feminazi of India

I won't get it from you bro...
Farishtey was a very good film

Akshay khanna would be embarrassed  

horrible

Ram did the same with Sita

Fuck u asshole voice..irritating
Really just 5?? All of bollywood is embarrassing!

Eeee...the guy at the end .. handsome ho

You actually had the patience to search for such scenes. They are nauseating

In last sean ..Isme sexiest ki kya baat hai bhai...agr ladka ladki ko kiss krne se roke to vo sexiest but agr ladki ladke ko roke to vo uski marji?

Mard was awesome movie... Being a kid during those days, and see all the stuff happening on the screen was absolute bliss...I even wrote Mard (In Hindi) on my chest with a pen... LOLXXX..Good ol memories...

Itni bate na bolke sidha vid dikhate to maza ata

Doodh waala asshole

u r so sexy bro

true
At <a href="">1:45</a>, Ye toh movies hain jinko koi chahe toh dekhe or chahe toh na dekhe. Pr un educational institutions ka kya kiya jaye jahan teacher 200-250 students k beech is tarah ki language istemal kre.

Why don&#39;t you make famous hollywood rediculas and non sense seen ...iam sure you will get amazing stuff.Always not now you guys mKing fun of your cinemas ...if jacky ..is flying its ok ...if shaktiman is flying its horrible .

Also make a video on Mithun's movie's dialogue...!!!
Wth 

<a href="">

Wasted 6 minutes of my life.

I am surprised you took the same contain as it was weird to me too 

bakwas video

NYC videos...

<a href="">3:08</a> rocks

Because of this logic my father did not apply it to me so that I got fed up with it.
The &quot; du du du&quot; was hillarious..i didnt even know that exist..But on a serious note..those kind of films were acceptable in those days becoz ppl were not aware about sexism, patriarchy..infact they thought it&#39;s outght to be like that. Good that..things have changed now..however if actresses like Kareena, Priyanka, Malaika, Katrina stops promoting themsleves as a sexual commodity through their songs like, &quot; mein toh tandoori murgi hoon yaar&quot; , &quot; sheela ki jawani&quot;, &quot; Pinky paise waalo ki&quot;...I mean it is so degrading to see where 100s of men lustfully eyeing and running behind a woman with drinks in hand and the woman enjoying the attention of such obnoxious, filty men touching them here and there. A steamy bed scene is 1000 times bttr than these cheap, flithy item songs. These actresses say that women should be respected and all that but they themselves dont care that they are creating a bad impression by doing such item songs &amp; making life tough for common women. I mean I dont want to generalise but  the labour class think that women are like that &amp; hence they think if a woman wears a short dress, that means she is inviting rape or they think women like to be stalked or touched etc like they show it in films where hero stalks the heroine, or sometimes kidnap her etc. But these actresses dont care neither bollywood. Had it been like that, then the top actresses would have voiced their opinion on <a href="">#metoo</a> movement..Sab dikhawa hain..PR activity..nothing else.

Vinod Khanna nothing yuuucckkkk 
Disgusting movies and dialogues !!!

I appreciate d way you keenly observe n speak about the things are being shown in movies.

<a href="">4:54</a> there&#39;s a Michael Jackson poster on the wall

Brother just listen to your sister and show me the movie clip also.
Race 3 ......Dumbness still exist.Thugs of hindustan....Dumbness got competition...

Where was the censor board when Vinod Khanna was saying his dialogue? Embarrassing as hell!Thank god I never watched that movie. A great list and you&#39;ve got a great voice too!

Your voice is so good.......

The truth or reality of society

Your accent is so sexy n hot

fuck you son of bitch

dudududu dudh
I just watched to hear your voice ... really good

The idea of flying with a plane was amazing 

Par yeh Matlab kuch bhi hogaya Sexy voice......

Thanks for the video. It would be more entertaining though if you actually showed the video clips rather than mainly talk about them over photos so we could also enjoy the said clips. Thank you though!

But even today,they show not only embarrassing but scenes which consists of 3 rd class acting,I guess movies of last decade between 2001 to 2010 was the best since only that time 1st class acting used to be done

Awesome voice dude...loved it.

In today's times, Bollywood Sarab is still learning...drugs are not learning...show us this too.
Do a video on horror movies of ramsay brothers...

That&#39;s why I married to an alien...earthlings are quite disturbing

Great analysis

Pretty much what is happening today as well, these 50 something actors still wanting to be the romantic leads in brain dead movies.

bakchodi movies means salman khan movies
Although embarrassing, it&#39;s not usually understood and accepted but here u go that&#39;s art!!!!

The voice over is superb. The language is so good, I wish I could use it in my class

Dude do something about your accent.

Hahahaha

Well done. Thanks for bringing this to our attention

Cute. :)

I was shocked to see the unprofessional attitude of the Judge in Jolly LLB.  I cannot watch that movie with my husband as I am so ashamed to say this is happening in India.

It&#39;s actually not illogical to society yet.. Still people has those mentality on woman.. Strong Words like purity, bold, sharm, haya all are so negative in real life even now..

Doo Doo Doo dooo
You look nice
So funny aur hum isse enjoy karte the 

Fucking eww

Dara singh part
Does this narrator boy have a cold?
Disgusting movies

Some scenes were too awkward....how did the censor board pass them ??

Ur voice is awsm

Brother, if you improve your knowledge in Hindi, it will help you more.
No really? You have to sit through all those classic Bolly Gold to make a video? How, just HOW do you do it????? What&#39;s the secret, bhai?

I love your reaction when u said..... Kuch bhi.... Very entertaining video....:-D

Ud ke niloge ahhahaha LOST IT ???
If you can then please talk about movies from the present too, the ones in which you find many problems so that people don&#39;t realise it after so many years. So that we don&#39;t create or expose ourselves to such things.Man! How was he even saying doodh and the girl in the frame normal? So, what if it was a dance bar or any other place...And seriously, sharam ke bina aurat kuch nahi Hoti and ardhaangni matlab kya???Sharam tumhein nayi aayi bakwaas bolne se pehle?Exactly kuuch bhi...

This was tough to watch.So tough.Really

Check out the song &quot;agar barsaat na hoti&quot;Anu agarwal and Vinod khanna.... Second half of the song they get naked  start banging on screen

I absolutely agree with you

Ghastly movies!! Thank goodness i did not waste my time watching them! Pls do a review on the shockingly embarrassing scenes after circa 2000

Mehendi was a blockbuster in terms of plot

I come here for good English n to polish my vocabulary 

You seems to hata 90s more than anything but you love today&#39;s film like grand masti, race 3 etc.

Those two Rani&#39;s movies have always made me uncomfortable even as a kid! Don&#39;t know how these people even thought of adding such nonsense scenes in a movie smh

Brother, are you ashamed of speaking in Hindi?
Can you make video on tv shows controversy

<a href="">4:54</a>

I feel 80-90s has the most weirdly made movies!!

What about the song &quot;Mai Agar Samne&quot; of Raaz?

You actually watched these bundle movies to get this content?!Hats off to you...Main to kisi cost pe na dekhoon
last one was awesome... Matlab Ghar pr baith kr hilana manjur hai but ladki ko sharam ka lecture jarur dena hai.. 

90s was by far the worst period for bollywood

Omg...

<a href="">#AskForSubscribePlz</a>

Mithun and Dharmendra have spread a lot in the 90s.
good video !

you-you-you-you-you-d- doodh
<a href="">3:06</a> at 2x speed!

Hey.. ur voice while speaking in Hindi is so sexy... Just my opinion no offense...

I like your works bro , I recommend try <b>Hollywood</b> to and please featured or add <b>Scenes</b> always in your videos . Ameen summa ameen

Man u really have a sexy voice and of course I like ur videos alot

What about your English then? Lol

Then Hollywood movies tere liye inspiring hogi?? Q gadhe

But this mtlb also happened. Please try and take it at Indra Gandhi airport.
Brother, Hindu religion has taken this tradition of veil from Muslim religion. In our religion, women were the biggest symbol of open society but they knew their limits.
Please dont make any video..

Dude your channel is no more about Bollywood you are using it to enforce  socially left politics because in your obsession to sound westernised (your funny English accent aside) you have assumed that sounding progressive will make you sound the wannabe westernised man you want to portray.

hay Jammy , would you please help me on finding Jasmin from Veerana movie or atlest make a video on her.....

Mr. Jammy pants This is a collective Challenge from the South You always mention how 90&#39;s and early 2000&#39;s is a period of some of the worst movies in the Bollywood. On the other hand they&#39;re one of the best for the South.... I wish you do more research and introduce these Stars to those northerners who&#39;re unaware of such gems.... 1.Chiranjeevi2.Mohanlal3.Mammutti4.Kamal HasanDo research on these stars and you&#39;ll find that there&#39;s more than that&#39;s meet the eye when it comes to south Indian movies

This video somehow reminded me about the action sequences and the item song of Mithun&#39;s film &quot;Zakhmi Sipahi&quot;. It will blow your mind. Include it in one of your lists.

Your voice is so damn attractive Yar

Sending love all the way from South Africa!! I really enjoy your channel, however I have a request; would you consider putting in English subtitles for the Hindi portions of your videos? I understand that editing is no walk in the park, but I sometimes miss a joke or some lines (especially in lists about movies).

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha how u get from that kind of movies bro. Awesome 

I am not sure if you have a video on top 10 Indian Web Series... Lemme know if you have one

Oh really? When captain america stops a helicopter from flying that pribably makes sense to you. No doubt bollywood has produces alot of crap. But people like you living on  someone else&#39;s work and with your Golden imported standards from bollywood should try undersyand our own people and show our positive side to the world with your time and energy. What new are you making that would make us proud?

Has this man gone crazy?
Well, I agree with that last one.
make videos on top 10 movies of each year(both commercial + critical)

You could have come up with better stuff!

95% of the Bollywood movies are embarrassing!

Ya I too love your voice, like big time. Not your looks definitely just the voice.

Bollywood is nothing but a mirror of our society. This kind of misogynist culture still prevails in Indian society.

What about race 3

<a href="">3:07</a>-<a href="">3:10</a> Dudu 
Worst

WTF girlfriend kiss doesn't even work
Many bollywood movies show male bashing. Now it&#39;s a routine.Golmaal 3, 4 just for fun, men are brutally <a href="">attacked.Now</a>, it&#39;s a faishon in bollywood.

That dooodh dooodh dooodh moment...
thats what indian film industry has been prevailing since last 3 decades, patriarchy, sexism &amp; nepotism.

hey...I don&#39;t agree with da comment for Dara Singh ha!! He is India&#39;s He-Man...only he can stop a &#39;plane-wah&#39;...like dat!!

Dudududududududududududududududu!! WTF

That's it... I don't like that any girl should show shamelessness ok.... But what is the need to die because she gets so angry.... Hahahahaha.... I just said that brother, I don't like it. Ana with shame and shame.
I get understand 60% of this video

I am surprised you haven&#39;t yet run into a legendary scene from Hum ho Gaye aap ke when apoorva agnihotri brings raima sen to his home from her wedding. Can&#39;t believe that was posted 90s

Have you forgotten Rajesh Khanna dialogue

Well what the girl did at the end of the video would be considered as sexual harassment if done by a boy. But somehow the act of the boy send sexist to you?. The sexist one seems clear

Mithun has chosen the most worst    movies.

Game of thrones dekhne wale sab c#### yaha galiya bak rahey lol <a href="">#irony</a>

It was embarrassing to watch it

aap English kyo bol rhe ho aap to Hindi movies ke bare mein bol rhe ho

chutiye jb meri adalat ke scene m vol bnd krni thi to kaiko dikhaya ajeeb chutiya h or baaki sb m matlb kccch bi jhatu phle apna dekh

I don’t think they were embarrassing! This list should have been better, I mean the sequences that showed male chauvinism in the entire movie must have been highlighted! Some of these movie did this for fun and some of them had corrected this kind of thinking in the end. I think these movies were great. Hence a dislike for the video. Just think twice about the content you put on an international channel about your own country, or otherwise don’t blame your government for not making Indian economy better( or Don’t make fun of your own while making fun of others)P.S. Your video is going to my top 5 most embarrassing video on YouTube this year list!

Over and out, it turned out to be dei version of Mojo jojo crap in every video of this . Have  fun suckas

Bhai I love your voice
<a href="">4:23</a> 
You should have probably included a song from Anil Kapoors movie called Anadaaz...the song is called &quot;Khada hai khada hai..&quot; god knows how that song got censor board clearance...hoping you can create a video of top 5 embarssing songs of 90s... overall great job with your videos...keep them coming. Cheers!!

Hi could you please, put up a video sharing stories of casting couch, harassment’s that few actors have spoken about..like currently Tanushree Dutta has come up talking about her experience with Nana Patekar...

Your voice&#39; is so cool!

really great friend
Bro really you always come up with amazing concepts

Itne bure bhi nai the

<a href="">4:20</a>...iski muh pe hag dena chahiye
Brother, you also overacted, you were talking about the Mard movie, tbb.
pls increase the volume whenever you show a video clip from a movie

tell me in hindi
Of course, her hair will be pulled out, but looking at the thumbnail, it is as if a rolling pin has been inserted into her ass.
The starting music .. i feel like to dance 

I m addicted to ur voice.

You should balance between narration part and actual scenes.

That voice tho 

Bakwass

When bollywood ka name comes to hindi word then why do you come to aap kyu english me bhashan jhaar raheho lol
This channel deserves way...way more subscribers...

Bro you sound like oggyf 

This video of yours was a bit ridiculous ..

He sounds like a guy from the daily dose of internet..

Doodh scene was really bad..he used Bhagwan Krishna&#39;s name for this kind scene..

Your voice sounds very sincere. This extracts the fun from the video.

Just becoz dialogues are In hindiIt become vulgar and uncomfortable?

Bhai samajh nhi aayi video sorry
The way you presents the whole concept is just awesome..

That last clip got me cracking up.

In the video I have just done <a href="">#bakchodi</a>.
Isme kuch Embarrassing ni h .. sabse embarrassing ye hai ke i clicked on this  video.. 

Poor you! You had to watch all these shitty things to make this video 

No doubt, 90s k films ki to kuch baat hi alag thi.

Kya!!!! Choot disease???? The king's arrival... Pls guys... Confirm...
Raja ki aayegi Barat,Mehendi etc are some best movies of Rani Mukharjee..haha..doodh doodh doodh.. haha

Your voice is 
bro you should make the video abouttop 10 worst movies ever in bollywood          andtop 10 worst actors in bollywood

bhai....2nd one is very possible as per laws of physics...As we can see that Dara Singh moved the rope 2 times around the pole....he had only to apply a little force...all the rest force was generated by just friction.....you can try and see how strong 2 rounds of rope can be..

<a href="">4:55</a> can’t hear the dialogues

I don&#39;t know about the last one...I mean I always use the &quot;switch test&quot; , switch the genders and see if a girl slaps a guy for kissing her in public...I think it&#39;s a legitimate scene, yet, the monologue that follows is a bit cringey



HOW OLD ARE YOU BRO

Funny film names

dodh dodh dodh dodh...  oscar winning dialogue of vinod khanna took the video single handedly hahahaha

Last one was disgusting. I guess he must be a gay or something 

Your voice
Is that Kunal voice???

Start music name pls

You hv alovely voice dude
The guy in meri adaalat is literally molested by being kissed without permission (not cringey in your opinion) but his rebuttal is, wash bhai.

Dude do you really watch these movies??, 

Plagiarised GobarWood for Gobars..

Please daya karo public pe

Your voice 
Hey bro I specially watch these movies starring mithun and dharmender for funHorrible movies

Aaj ka sunny <a href="">

<a href="">

Good bro..but why sometimes u remind me of Shirish Kunder.. Farah&#39;s husband

You That Is The Reason Why Indian Films Can&#39;t Win The Oscar&#39;s!!!!!Because Hollywood Films Are Very Much Progressive Than Bollywood Because They Showcase Strong Characters Of Every Gender In Any Genere Of Movies!!!!!They Dont Showcase Illogical &amp; Absurd Things About Women In Name Of Bloody Entertainment!!!!!!

Dudh..Dudh..Dudh

Bhai aap ye filme dekh ke comment karte ho.... you need a temperament to watch such disgusting movies hats off to you brother...

This was seriously tough to watch.. I don&#39;t know how you managed to watch these creepy movies!

Please show the full scenes instead pf just narrating them.

Most Annoying things in Bollywood 

Loved it when you spoke hindi.. 

It seems your channel is quite negative bro, most of the videos are negative.

Your voice 
I love that bluddy bold girl... Definitely she deserved a slap in 1990s and we boys deserve slaps in 2018... ARE we not getting penalized for his actions in 1990s..

You know... These sexist dialogues and ideas are actually the entirety of the mentality of soooo many men in the society. Only difference between them and their 90s counterpart is that they have mastered the art of hiding their true chauvinistic ways of thinking with the facade of a liberal and progressive man as per the demands of the modern times.. they are now just afraid.. rest all is same inside

I was so shocked nd horrified at 3.08 dat I literally could not hear what ever told after it

Why would anyone slap his girlfriend for kissing him in public? And that wasn&#39;t even kiss, that was just a peck. What a lunatic prick he is. Sanskaari ban raha hai saala hypocrite. Aise pakhandiya toh suhaagraat ke waqt mein bhi biwi ko thapad marsakte hain ki kapde kyon kholi. HahahahahaWhat a boring, psycho, unromantic jerk. If I was her I would slap him back and spit in his ugly face instead of kissing him. Jerks like him will remain single forever.

Some things still happen now...

come out of your udder
Make videos on star kids

Thats how movies were , something that could portray the impossible   Such a shit video made by you . Meaningless.



Yaar, this bad boy was not even kissed by such a nice girl.
Bakk bakkAbey kaise kaise log vids banane lage
Boy u come up with strange assumptions and titles. .

And now I realised why I felt disgusted and irritated and also hated films after watching films of this era! 

Dara Singh in this movie possessed by wonder woman...matlab kuch bhi...

1996

Last Wala dialogue sahitha be 

The best scene of movie mard is where dara Singh writes mard on his newly born childs chest with knife and says mard ko dard nahi hota. The kid didn&#39;t cried.RIP logic.

Judwa 2Houseful 3RaeesDilwaleKickFanHappy New YearDabangg 2Jab tak hai JaanReadyWantedWhat about all these movies?

If any man did that to me who was dating me. I&#39;d bitch slap the sexism out of him until he couldn&#39;t tell who&#39;s a man and who&#39;s a woman 

do do do do do do doodh...
What happened if the old man gave a few words to Galat and today he took off his clothes?
I dont know how u managed to watch this shirty movies

Your voice 
Don&#39;t try jokes.Seriously yrr

How bad can it go...? I sipped milk and vinod khanna started saying &quot;Dudh dudh dudh&quot; Drinking milk while watching this video was not a good idea. 

Ohh mere bhai come out of obsession for comercial cinema Why only these films? Even so called progressive , intellectuals and off beat directors showcase women as an object. But you don&#39;t have spine to criticize so called off beat movies like dev d, gangs of wassepur and omkaara. Because if you criticize them u will sound like an unintellectual. Don&#39;t be selective. Thumbs down 4 ur approach

Hats off to u for watching such movies which we dint even know exists....

Last scene in which girl kissed him nd he slapped...seriouslyBhai itna sakht londa aajtk maine ni dkha...Mtlb kuch bhi

K Pappu. That says a lot.

<a href="">4:55</a> she squealed like a chihuahua... Lol

 dududududududududududududududududududududududududududu
all those film play on free DTH daily

Plane wala joke... Mst tha 

damn that&#39;s a sexy voice. ..you should try singing as well

what dialogues by vishal bakshi ? we didn&#39;t hear that. At least you could add subtitles

Muted from <a href="">4:56</a>

Mard was a flop you moron

Not sure why the last scene was included. Indians need to remember their culture instead of trying desperately to be western.

Kunal kamra is that you ??

May be the guy in the last clip was in the closet 

Man no doubt the scene from  mard was illogical but dara singh was not just another man who went to gym. He was a professional wrestler who had even earned laurels worldwide and made india prod in 60s!!

Like pussy disease hahahah
Man!!! Vinod Khanna was disgusting.

I misheard it as choot ki bimari 

Rani mukherjee - good eye for scripts Her last hit was 13 years ago

Tu baith k yeh sare videos dekhta hai?

Who were the members of censor board when this doodh doodh movie was released? Although this movie Farishtay was a patriotic movie rather than third grade porn.

Hahaha nice list buddy I think Flashfivelist channel has more potential.

And the most sanskari guy goes to the last one

Cringeworthy!!!!
<a href="">4:56</a> she sounds like squeaky shoes when he slaps her

The last sequence is pretty fair. What if a man had done the same to a woman and she slaps and says the same thing. Suddenly it looks alright doesnt it?

Jammy you are so cute.

Rani Mukherjee debut film is Biyer Ful. It&#39;s Bengali movie
Kabhi kabhi lagata he.....tum na hote to hame ye sab kon batata.....

It&#39;s time to unsubscribe this channel

Matlab kuch b 
And also on rip offs being better than the original &amp; dialogues that negatively motivates you or make you angry.

Meaning bollywood walo ne hi kiya hai age discrimination gender discrimination and treat girl like she is baap ka maal fir bole hai hamare zaamane ki baatein kabhi offscreen dekh lete mil lete toh pata chaalta kuch hai ki zaamane ki baatein bollywood
Hey make a list on best scenes in Indian cinema history

make some video about other regional movies.

Recent topics are very monotonus......U should change this topic...

I mainly watch your videos because you sound exactly like my ex-boyfriend.

He had videos this time.

I LOVE YOUR VOICE.....I JUST LOVE IT....
I recently watched again hum tumhare hain sanam, srk has some so sexist dialogues that I don&#39;t know how he could ever agree saying

I disagree about the last scene. But rest of the video is too good

Cringey doodh

Do a video about Tumbbad movie trailer
Bro I love your content.
Hats off to u man for watching such movies

Please Make A List On Worst Bollywood Movies By Shahrukh &amp; Salman Khan In Recent Times!!!!!!!

Now I Found Out That Why Vinod Khanna&#39;s Dadasaheb Phalke Award Victory Was So Controversial!!!!!!!This Bollywood Can Only Celebrate These Illogical Actors &amp; Not Real Actors Like Nasseruddin Shah &amp; Om Puri!!!!!!

TV channels must stop telecast of such offensive movies. 80% of India still thinks these are entertainment and   believe in these dialogues. We need to educate them.

(Speaking sarcastically don’t take seriously)Do you agree Wolf of Wall Street is a garbage  sexist movie and Leonardo di caprio who is working to promote patriarchy agenda his whole career should be disliked and his fans deserve hell for watching it?I wonder when Jamy will voice these concerns about Hollywood ,he only does this to old Bollywood actors whose era is bygone who had different sense of morality.But that doesn’t excuse the patriarchy Jamy can’t spare them.

Matlab captain America helicopter roke to taali.. Dara singh roke to gaali... Bohot h bdiya

No offence..But regarding the last one..Sab ka choice different hota hai...If a boy says he wants a well cultured and traditional type girl then that must be respected like we respect when a girl wants that kind of guy .(But yeah he should haven&#39;t slapped her).

He said <a href="">4:25</a> chut???

I’ll say it again ,it’s stupid to compare morality of past with present and paint those people evil and say they only worked for money.Imagine your kids accusing you of being immoral 30 years later because you made fun of gay people in high school or college and don’t tell me you were this ultra progressive kid since childhood and supporting the lgbt cause and against the patriarchy.We should learn whatever good we can from all people of all eras that’s what history is for .If we focus only on negatives there’s no point to recording history you’ll see every king was sexist and morality meant something else to them so should we stop making any movies or only portray them as immoral.Sometimes make a video about positives too.

This made my day

Main mathura ka rehne wala ho isliye doodh doodh karta ho 

I enjoy your content because we can tell that you do your research when creating these videos. However, I have a criticism to make. IMO, The intro sequence is very uninspired and the music used is very loud. Please go back to your old intro which was simple and classy.

If I were in your place and I need to watch all these movies, I need therapy

Who is TRP Rinkeya's father?
I pity on you man you have to watch these nonsense to make these videos

In hindi we say that.. khud Ko Dara Singh samajhta hain... For the person who thinks he is strong.. and mard scene was homage to that Dara Singh.. it is mass scene.. logics fail here it also part of our popular cinema..

i am pretty sure these patriarchal scenes were not glorified so isnt it ok if they are demonising it?

Vikas bakshi must have joinedi sanskari anti romeo squad
<a href="">3:07</a> 

well i think Dara Singh Thing can be A POSSIBLE THING.

I am a simple man still I find it cringe hearing doodh doodh doodh.....

Omg! &quot;Doodh&quot; scene is so sick nd cringeworthy!

Salah will do even more to make the video. Kuch will also understand. even little will understand
Doodh

i have a question.. Did u watch all the movies that have ever made in bollywood..  I mean like its insane that how much knowledge u got abt such movies..  

After all, tell me why you watch these movies.
Man, these guys are no better than Hollywood guys..! KB se chu...Bana rahe hain tk

The last one... 

Doodh Doodh Doodh Doodh 

Bro you really have to change the &quot;Intro&quot; it sucks

Stop praising rani Mukherjee unnecessarily, she isn&#39;t listening,  you are not going to get any chance at yrf. Her choice of script was nice!!!!  Lol...  Her choice of breaking home was nice.. Before she started her affair with aditya chopra just check her films... She is a cunning golddigger, knew where she don&#39;t have to hire a pimp to support her lifestyle if she can secure the most happening production house. Ruining someone&#39;s home?? Who cares??  Brand new feminazis are here.

Debate Debate Debate Debate Debate Debate.... WTF !!
The Mard film sequence outdoes even Chuck Norris, let alone Rajinikanth

I love you man!!
Shocking!

<b>Jammy how much will you bake to fuck</b>
Don&#39;t you think you should stop using &quot;extremely&quot; so extremely for some time?

This guy is biased as f**k...How in this world you find old bollywood movies patriarchy and sexiest...While the same bollywood make movies like Kya kool hai hum Series, Masti Series and several other adult movies...You really need to work in unbiased way..Or else stop stereotyping everything...

All Dharmendra, Mithun, Vinod and Jeetendra movies in the 90s are embarrassing and also Salman Khan movies in 2010s are embarrassing as well

Hats off to you for bearing all these movies. Makes me wonder if there is any movie that you haven&#39;t <a href="">seen.You</a> could have a guiness world record for watching  the most movies . 

That doodh doodh scene looks even more bizzare when played at 1.5x.

pehle bhi chutiye the aur abhi bhi chutyie hai bhare pade hai idhar.

DUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU.....WTF
Make a video sequence on one of the greatest scenes ever made in INDIAN CINEMA.

Maha Shakti shali, k papu seriously 

boss your analysis is right but please don&#39;t talk in Hindi it&#39;s very irritating because it sounds like you are insulting the people also Rani&#39;s film is about the consequences women will Face after they get married to a rapist it&#39;s a satire on the abusive marriages please understand a movie and then talk about it

<a href="">2:35</a> 

<a href="">2:55</a> yeh movie main bauht bauht bauht hi bachpan me puuri family k sath tv pe dekha tha..!!

Dhoodh

90s was the best era of bollywood after sixties and 70s...this guy is showing just cheap third rated b grade disasters like maha shakthishaali and all..which didn&#39;t even get release even in the extreme rural side of bihar where 100 illiteracy still exists...80s was the 3rd right phase of bollywood and that continued a bit to early nineties too...that&#39;s all...atleast remember that our 3 legendary khans,madhuri dixit,kajol,ajay devgan,akshay,sanjay dutt all flourished as star materials on that time....damini,dil se,ghulam,sarfarosh,agneepath,border,agni sakshi,baazigar,darr,rangeela,sathya,vasthav,virasat,dushman,kaun,etc and countless number of superb entertainers ,classics and underrated classics came that time.....even the music quality was at the best phase that time....that&#39;s why most of the current panothis of bollywood are surviving on remixing the hits from that decade mostly...technically bollywood gained it&#39;s identity and goodwill after 10 horrible years of 80s on that decade ...even the music industry of bollywood also shining at it&#39;s best then....this idiot is only showing the pathetic movies of the last days of the hero career of mithun chakraborty ,dharmendra,etc who all got field out by 90s....what&#39;s the use of hanging on some creepy b grade stuffs...if your were trolling the top hits of 80s...then there&#39;s some truth..most of these creepy b grade movies in 90s were the top grossing films of that time...

That doodh one was so cringe omg



I hate mehendi 
<a href="">5:16</a> you look cute. (I hope am not sounding creepy)

Most of the movies directed by Manmohan Desai  were like this.

&quot;Aurat khaandaan k sath argue nai kr skti&quot; dis thing is still in practice in many houses, even &quot;bahu&quot; should only say &quot;ji&quot;, moreover that even if it&#39;s not her fault then also she has to say sorry to everyone n say &quot;I&#39;ll not repeat this mistake again&quot;

@<a href="">03:08</a> White revolution has never been so successful anywhere in the world apart from India.

<a href="">3:15</a> and Vinod Khanna was given the <b>Dadasaheb Phalke</b> award for such acting

Obsessed with breast? Whose not? If you say you are not you are lying Yeah but we don&#39;t go doodh doodh doodh 

Love your voice 
Wud love to see a part 2,3 of this one...

You wanna watch Bollywood movies just keep in mind that all actors are superhuman in disguise , the industry guys don&#39;t want us to know that.

Really nice content and narrative..

Your channel is never gonna run out of content.....the 90s made sure of that

I m ok with sexism

The last scene of your list is inappropriate on the account of a slap only whereas the mentioned dialogue by the actor is definitely not sexist or demeaning.Your condemnation only proves this twisted logic, that pseudo liberals like you who are hell bent to thrust down the throats of the predominantly conservative audience of South Asians, that immodest and lecherous behavior of a man or woman openly is a normal and accepted norm and should never be frowned upon.

I trusted this channel but he also started CLICKBAIT Fuck you

At <a href="">4:28</a>, Meri Adalat shows why not just Sridevi should have left Mithun Chakraborty. Once she left him his talents and abilities to find hit films did too.

At <a href="">2:42</a>, Vinod Khanna showed why Bollywood has had a sexism problem for years.He was allowed to be cast as a fat man, but women like Dimple Kapadia needed liposuction, yoga, and exercise to get roles. He should have been blacklisted after Chandani in 1987! Why?We would have never seen him in Dayavan banging Madhuri one year later with his loose skin and old balls.

I love your videos bro your voice seems to be very cool to the videos

I don&#39;t know if you already have a video on harassment showcased as having fun with women in Bollywood movies. If not, please do. I cannot watch varun dhawan on screen because he did that ugly film called judwa. I mean, How on earth do you think will harassment stop with films like judwa?

You have seen all this so that we can't see it.
Ur narration is sooo Gud 
Those were the days I can&#39;t differentiate between Shaktimaan and Gangadhar, then the incident of avoiding flight just by tiding it to a pole seems authentic to me 

Abe Chut ke dhakan itna baat kiya aagar video dikha Deta to video ko views mil jate - Very irritating

If you ever plan to start a merchandise...please include a t-shirt with &quot;KUCHHHH BHIIIII&quot; on it I&#39;ll totally buy it
