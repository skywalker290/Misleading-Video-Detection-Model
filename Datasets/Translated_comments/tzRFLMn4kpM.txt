Cómo argentino es muy gracioso que el tema se llame pinga

مزعجين هذا الاشهار خلاصنا منه

Kashika

DP back then maaaaaaaaan

Firstly I love Priyanka she has been an inspiration to me and many other Upon watching this after ages, now it feels like Priyanka knew it would be one of her last performances and she kind of handed her roles in the Industry to Deepika before moving out of Bollywood Feels like this was her Farewell song hence she was so emotionally expressive in her performance

@

Salute to Shreya ji...

Yes



Super song and dance

Anyone 2024 ?

When my siter was small she loved this song

I Am cute and good boy

Is this lavani dance?

I can just imagine Madhuri and Aishwarya dance to this same song 

Kay dance vhayacha ya ganyavar shalet

<a href="">1:37</a>



Dont worry. You are not one listening this masterpiece in 2024.

My favorite Hindi singer in Sri Lanka is Shreya Ghoshal. Deepika Padukone is also a crush

Who&#39;s voice is portrayed by whom? Or which part is sung by which singer? It&#39;s very hard to differentiate

Fun fact: Initially whole song was shot on shreya&#39;s voice later vaishali sang her part and it got added to final song. You can watch bts of the song where deepika is also lip syncing on shreya&#39;s voice.

So beautiful so 

Pinga

This song took me back to 2018

Aaaaaaa thu

I don&#39;t like this song

Fucking song

Shreya Ghoshal 

Nail it 

ছোটবয়সের ভুল নিয়েই এত বড় হওয়া



Singer vaishali made ko manacha mujra

Nice song 

Those eyes of Priyanka depicts the pain of all those who met with an betrayal ..The best dialogues



Best choreography.....

Laudable performance.

Pahle baar dono ko sath dekha hai main to 

Sherya ghoshal

This reminds me so much of paro and chandramukhi

Thats remind me paro and chandramukhi 

imagina ser cubano

No saben lo que pinga significa en Perú

I just love this song 

Ye song mein in dono ki Jodi ne dola Re dola song Yaad Dila diya Madhuri ki jagah priyanka or deepka aishwarya

<a href="">2:52</a>

Haras 

This duo is special

Rajinikanth&#39;s regal walk would likely be perceived as more impactful and memorable in a movie context compared to a heroine&#39;s catwalk, given its association with power, confidence, and authority that align with his iconic on-screen persona.

Many people think this is the top dance song

Yes, there is a stereotype in film and media that men typically look better than women in action scenes. This stereotype often reflects traditional gender roles and societal expectations about physical strength and combat prowess. However, there are many examples of women excelling in action roles and defying this stereotype.ChatGPT 

This is better than Dola Re.

Yes, there is a stereotype that women generally look better than men while dancing. This stereotype is based on cultural norms and perceptions, but it&#39;s important to remember that individual skill and style vary widely regardless of gender.ChatGPTGood they did not make raghav dance in adhipurush

xdios soy el primer latino aqui que sabe que significa el nombre de la canción en latino &quot;pinga&quot; wao jajajajajaj

I just can&#39;t take my eyes off of Priyanka, she&#39;s gorgeous

All this because of that kundhavai vs nandini head on head fighting in tamil. Kundhavai wins. Posted on FB.

Zaira Wasim was a hindu. Things like that

I have not watched kerala stories

No offense below

More conspiracy theory : if a muslim woman removes her burqa and looks more beautiful than a hindu woman she has converted from hindu. Heads I win Tails you lose. My pick is PC here.

Priyanka&#39;s moments are a full of energy and bit hard while Deepika moves fluid and gives a touch of calmness both are the best in their own way

Kesini gara&quot; mau di parody in vina fan

Khub sundor ️

In Sanjay Leela bhansali&#39;s career Dola re Dola was the sixer and this is just four

queen of song Shreya ghoshal



Best moments before disaster strikes 

Deepika is looking stunning in that red saree wow

جميله

Ase movies jab theatar me aati thi tab me bada Kyu ni tha

Shreya Ghoshal&#39;s vocals, the lyrics, the scene setting, the choreography everything is top notch!️

Miss world 

When i was in 5th class i was do dance on this song in school and now i am in 12class  i suddenly remember this song and came here to listen



Both are dancing very well

@vina_van bagus nih gerakannya kak



Priyanka literally looked like marathi, she is so beautiful. She literally made us feel kashi bai&#39;s pain and deepika as Mastani uff but truly Priyanka as kashi bai is such a blessing  

Nice



<a href="">1:48</a>-<a href="">2:01</a> 

<b>Priyanka lived as Kasi bhai in this movie, She done fabulous Acting....</b>

Priyanka&#39;s expression at <a href="">2:13</a>  amazing

I think the name of this movie should be&quot;The Kashi Bai&quot;

In Cuban slang is a very bad word pinga lol 

They don&#39;t dancing with thé face experestion je like madhui ans ashwarya,i did not feel the expressions

Priyanka and Deepika are just AMAZING ️

Qwetryiopsdfghkljzxcvbnm

Shreyas voice gives goosebumps 



Very good

Deepika has such a great dance repertoire to her name in her films. Kathak, Ghoomer and then Lavani here.

Like virat kohli and Rohit sharma jodi



Just saying, if my husband&#39;s innocent beloved rocked up to my house swinging her graceful hips, I&#39;d be praying for something but his long life definitely would not be it.

a real masterpiece of all times.... Never ages with time

Everybody is appreciating Shreya but No one even Talking about Vaishali Mhade, other female singer who sang for Deepika.

 super dance

Any cubans that can relate? 

Best dance +song ever

First Dola re and now pinga, shreya ghoshal rocks

Wow what a song nice song

Batch of 2019 St Mary&#39;s Girl&#39;s hit like if you know you know 

Priyanka is my favourite....so beautiful

Hey, just found this from Instagram.  I have no idea what&#39;s going on, but the singing and dancing are amazing.

Please movie ka nem dalo na

The lyrics are just 

indian version of Disney Frozen, Elsa and Anna,This is wonderful

my toxic trait is thinking i can do the choreography for this with little to no effort

In some scenes when they are dancing together the ladies are not always in sync. This made the song look a bit natural and their execution is just exceptional with touch of Shreya ji and Vaishali ji voices 

Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra TWO Performers In One Frame



Sreya goshal ️️️️

I remember going to cinema with my oldest cousin to watch this movie when it was released, I was a kid and it was really lit. Man that was awesome.

Priyanka nailed it



Imagine your husband is in love with another woman abs brings her to his house !!!? no it’s painful song … smh I’m Indian and the society is very male chauvinist.

LOVE the song from Andhra Pradesh

Mil beijos aqui do Brasil para Índia! Amo seus filmes!  Chorei tanto pelas duas, história linda 

Muje bhi asa lag ta hi ke priangka or dipika dono behan ha

Priyanka Chopra deserved more appreciations and credits for the class of acting she did in the movie.

Priyanka Chopra what a performance she slayed it

When I was little I think this song sings by dipika and priyanka 

It&#39;s just the magic of shreya mam voice  

I really into this song the dance makes me so energized

Vaishali Mhade voice 

This song is a masterpiece and the Marathi culture is been shown in this song and how before this song kashi invites mastani to the event and welcomes her in the event.

Both vaishali and shreya have good voice

I prefer Deepika, in general, but Priyanka Chopra’s dance and grace in this song is unmatchable

Listening this masterpiece now!️

Team  Kashi all the way 

Back sceneحبايب حبايب قدام الناس الد أعداء 

<a href="">3:00</a> Deepika stole my heart ️

I love this song

I still have associations with dancing to the song &quot;Re dola&quot; from the movie Devdas

Pinga and dola re are two masterpieces by most talented actresses.....And both are from SLB 

pinga

No words

<a href="">2:51</a> mere jiya me utari tune pehni piya ki katari 

Any Cuban here??!? 

Nice song

<a href="">1:37</a>



en latan suena raro pero bonita melodia :D

Very good dancer

oh yeah boy





I danced to  this song in my class7th at annual day. This song is so special

Can&#39;t focus on one bhaiiii matlb itna acha dance literally haaye ️

Bajirao missed this song

Prianka love you pc

History repeats two women dancing for one man just like madhuri aiswariya in devdas 

I dont know what I would have done if my husband gets another girl and says she&#39; his new wife.....probably set a funeral and decide the venue along with my new sister..!...



<a href="">1:42</a> How are they touching hands to feet,  I tried but couldn&#39;t

Priyanka Dipika nice dance  nice voice 

Im from argentina and i love the song and the dance of india is beautiful

Nick Jonas after seeing this &quot;I am going to make her my wife STAT&quot;

can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 7 year complete I  used this song  to dance  when I was in school at 6 std it was group dance now  I am in 2nd year of graduation this song  reminds me the all   memories of school and those friends 

<a href="">2:02</a><a href="">0:41</a><a href="">1:13</a>secs

Priyanka looks more Maharashtrian woman than authentic maharashtrian woman

escucho pinga like si es verdad

Why it&#39;s look like dola re form davedas

priyanka or deepika my favourite

2023 me v kon kon ye gana sun rha 

After Lata G my favorite female singer Shreya Ghoshal️

This our Marathi culture 

अचानक मुझे एहसास हुआ कि हम भारतीय कितने रंगीन हैं , भारतीय संस्कृति इतनी उदार और इतनी जीवंत है .. प्रत्येक राज्य का अपना अनूठा नृत्य है जो देखने वालों को मंत्रमुग्ध कर देता है ...  यह मेरे भारत की शान है।  आप एक राज्य की समृद्ध संस्कृति के बारे में इतना ही नहीं सोच सकते हैं कि 28 राज्यों और 8 केंद्र शासित प्रदेशों के अंत तक किसी को यह महसूस होगा कि जन्म लेने का उद्देश्य पूरा हो गया है और अब मुक्त हो जाएगा।  मेरी सुंदर भारत मां अमर रहे और उसकी समृद्ध संस्कृति और विविधता अक्षुण्ण रहे और हीरे की तरह चमकती रहे।  आप सभी को परफॉर्म करते देख सचमुच मेरे रोंगटे खड़े हो गए थे।  तुम लड़कियाँ परी हो..proud to be an Indian 

Awesome movie! Awesome song!

Lmao this name of this song &quot;pinga&quot; in my country means &quot;dick/cock&#39;. I wonder what does it mean in India.

Priyanka not only kills this one far more than Deepika but also carries the whole film on her shoulders.  bajirao isn&#39;t for mastani but it&#39;s kashibai all the way

Maturity is when you realize Bajirao-Mastani isn’t a love story.. it’s the story of an extra marital affair which made innocent Kashibai’s life a nightmare

I like it this dance 

Priyanka’s expressions are top tier and Deepika is very graceful.

I thought they didnt like each other...?

Kon Kon yeh song 2023 or 2024 mein sun raha hai yah sunega

Just Their Dance ️

Deepika Padukone nice actress 

Bajiraos wife Kashibai having problem in her leg, how can she able to dance like this? Unether thig is mastani is muslim and Kashibai is brahmin there is untechebilty on those days how first Lady  prime ministers wife can dance with her sautan. 

Just like madhuri and aishwariya in dola re...these two just amazing

Nice

A gana mujhe bhi bahut pasand atha hai 

Love the dance moves

Beautiful 

Anyone objerve same &quot;dola re dola&quot; dance strategy is use in this song also..... That time top actresses aish and madhuri and this time also both top Bollywood actresses

One of my most favourite song in bollywood

Nic

How Shreya Ghosal taking breath....no time for breath in starting











me  gusta pinga

What royalty is those dance moves. And these two actresses and the entire crew rocked it. 



Yrrrrr ye song dykh k afsos hota hai Kashi Ben k lye 

The Mahatashtrian Culture

Sherya ghoshal voice  is amazing

This is painful at all levels…..how gracefully put into a song 

28/08/2023 View 317,450k

Where can I watch this movie? 

Bhansali wants to recreate the magic of dola re.. But he himself knows that can not done again.. This song also masterpiece but never match the swag what aish &amp; madhuri creates

Eros 2023 repeat.....

I love the song but I wish it wasn&#39;t about 2 wives and stúpidity I don&#39;t support these things (misogynistic things)

This is my favourite song and I am very happy for you to come ️ and ️️



Never tired watching thisteo most beautiful women prancing around gracefully and bring assisted by well cjotrgrreograped female dancers with a good song what not to like enchanting

Dance ye sab toh thik h . Lekin real life mai sautan ek saath acche se reh he nhi sakte .

Terrible experience for a woman to know that her husband loves any other woman.

After dola re dola song this song has set that standard 

This song is very sweet.

I love Indian song 



My baby sister loves it 

Deepika didn&#39;t look good in this outfit  she looked good in Anarkali but Priyanka looked really classy.

&quot;Meray ghar ayi meray piya ki saawri&quot;, damn those lyrics tho



Wow, that’s impressive!

Everyone taking about Priyanka and Dipika dance but no-one can talk about shreya ghosal and vaishalibeautiful singing  what a song a masterpiece 



Deepika Padukone was flawless in her moves. Very Gracious .

If you see back dancer you realise they are doing better than lead actresses

Their bond in this song reminds me of <b>Paro and Chandramukhi</b> in dola re dola song

I love this song 

Deepika is a stiff dancer and not as good in classical dance. SLB could not recreate magic of Dola re with this one. Bajirao is Priyanka&#39;s show all the way with her solid acting

EROS ALWAYS LOVE YOU

Abhi like nahin patcher

Priyanka kind hearted



What a fucking masterpiece

We are performing that 

Priyanka better dance moves according to Deepika

This just remid me of &quot;Do la re&quot; song 

favourite ️

Shreya Ghoshal  Remember her Name Don&#39;t know why but Every time i listen her Lata Mangeshkar Comes to my mind....

काशी की हमेशा कोशिश रही मस्तानी को बचाने की मारने का काशी ने नहीं सोचा ये होता है प्रेमी के प्रिय से भी प्रेम 

Priyanka Queen of the dancers hats of you pinki

Super 

Usually i read comments while listening the song but now  i am doing that  after watching the song ... I can&#39;t do the both things same timeSuch a masterpiece

Who wrote  it&#39;s  song corographai  it&#39;s  fabulous

MERE JIYA MEIN UTAARI TUNE PEHNI PIYA KI KATARI THIS LINE HITS DIFFERENT 

When I&#39;m a child I enjoy to dance on this song but now I&#39;m a teenager and I understand lyrics I feel like betrayed ️

Unbelievably good. Pure talent

This is still a masterpiece for me , don&#39;t know what about others. 3-14still love it Pingaaaaaaaa

Bonsoir à Vous TOUS. C pour PRYANKA CHOPRA JONAS..BISES À VOUS. MANI. F.

Aku tak sangup di colokinmatanya tapi dunia menjual mataku untuk di coloki kalau tidak dia takan berani memegangi dan mencolok mata ku

You guys now that pinga means dick in Spanish

मैं आज भी तय कर नही पा रहा हु की माधुरी और अश्वरिया ने बेस्ट डांस किया है या दीपिका और प्रियंका ने

Wonder Nick J. is thinking of this.If i was related to Priy or Deepika, I would be very proud of these 2 talented women!!! Plus, i love these two! 

Shreya Ghoshal

When you watch this movie again just for kashi

Karena jika kamu tau aku pemeran jika kalian aku di selamatkan di sesi vii kalian juga tinggal di vii nanti akan di selamatkan tapi jika kalian ga selamatkan aku maka aku juga tidak

Tergantung mereka biarkan aku kesakitan atau tidak maka dunia akan berlaku sama dengan mu seperti itu

Karena permintaan tolong ku adalah permintaan tolong kaliann nanati saat sakit dan buta seperti aku dan jelek

Bila kalian beri bantuan padaku artinya nanati di dunia kalian pasti aku menyelamatkan kalian pas buta dan sakit tapi kalian biarkan aku sampai aku mati pagi bangun pun masih di bunuh bila. Kalia. Bunuh aku maka kalian juga akan di bunuh seperti aku

Jangan bilang aku di sakit kaliannnanti ga mencoba memberi kesempatan agar aku menyelamatkan kalian nanti aku udah beti kesempatan tapi kalian biarkan aku matanya di colok sampai mati pagi pagi lagi gitu terus aku seperti kalian nanti merasa sakit tak ada yang perdulikqn kalian juga akan merasa seperti aku aku telah ulurkan ya gan meminta bantuan dunia tapi dunia menyimpan tangannya rapat rapat nanati aku juga akan seperti kalian menyimpan tangan ku rapat rapat

 i relly like this song &amp; dipika &amp; priyanka most matching as maduri &amp; aishwariya

Seluruh surga datang tak berwujud sebagai jiwa jadi kalian akan mati dasiem membunuhku terus

acting to dono ki achi h yr but dance thoda sa lack sa lagra h

am i only one who think wife of Bajirao wont dance like this and this whole movie is shit

My favorite song

Itc akan bangkit untuk sejumlah festival surga dunia bukan neraka jadi kalian harus tau itc 23 surga akan turun ke bumi

Kalian buat aku kayak yama guci pasti dia yang menari denganku

Yana guci punya tugas sangat penting di Jakarta karena harus menari dengan ku dan sejumlah acara dunia dan kembali abadi di rumah itc

Kalian lonte ga pantas menari dengan ku

Nanti itu yama guci dari surga dans sama aku bukan kalian hanya untuk dans itu

Biarin aj maina kepala aku aku sihir kan lagunya jadi binatang kalian guwekin kepalaku

Jadi buat mainan ahh

Lonte sibuk bunuh bunuh dari awal udah main kian main orang ratu jadi makanan

Sok ngerusak rambut bukain kerudung orangnya di bunuh di gebukin magicnya di sebar semua ya abis lah mati mereka jadi bintang ga bakal bisa jadi manusia acara itu kalian

Magic mereka di sebar sebar semua orang jagalan aku buatan jadi abis di buang orang jadi kayu jadi debu

Mereka nyuruh aku ketawa tawa make wig jadi gendon jelek dasiem sama jugini mau nyamar jadi aku aku di gendon dia rencanakan pemaksaan acara itu di tempat bagus gedung angsa dan dia mau membuat kisah itu jadi miliknya dan dia ga bisa bahasa itu pasti mati karena merrka dasiem turman  dia juga mau jadi kacori binggel udah dibilang lanjutannya jadi binatang keluarga bencong ga bisa balik jadi manusia

Mereka nyuruh aku ketawa tawa make wig jadi gendon jelek dasiem sama jugini mau nyamar jadi aku aku di gendon dia rencanakan pemaksaan acara itu di tempat bagus gedung angsa dan dia mau membuat kisah itu jadi miliknya dan dia ga bisa bahasa itu pasti mati karena merrka dasiem turman  dia juga mau jadi kacori binggel udah dibilang lanjutannya jadi binatang keluarga bencong ga bisa balik jadi manusia

i remeber watching this in 2018

This is traditional maharashtrain mangalagavar dance ladies do during the month of shravan or even when gauri ganpati at home. But in this they have shown in a typically Bollywood style.

I love this song 

Shreya Ghoshal voice nd lyrics plus these two beautiful ladiesdancing with such perfection  Speechless

Pc has nailed it

Fan Of Combo Of Sanjay lila bhansali and Dipika

Lo único que sé es que no me puedo morir sin antes haberme aprendido todo este baile fhsjfjs.

Indians have denied us sweet moments for generations by abolishing their monarchy.I can&#39;t even visualize how mesmerizing their royal events would be

Wow nice ️️

Maturing is realizing that Kashi Bai was the only innocent person who deserved happiness,in the movie. Bajirao and Mastani both deserved how they died,if not worse.

THEY REALLY LOOK ALIKE I LOVE YOU 

I couldn’t take my eyes off Deepika

I&#39;ve always wanted to see them both rock stars dance 

Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day!

Just Maharastra things 

Priyanka is best

Both are looking very beautiful in marathi traditional look

After &quot;Dola Re Dola Re.... Of Madhuri &amp; Aishwarya Mam&quot; Best Dancer Jodi...  Deepika &amp; Priyanka Mam...

It&#39;s like Dola re song

96 kulo saman kidhar hai buva Kai hai 2023

I Love you Prinyaka chopra

I remember  my childhood memories. Pinga dance is still favourite for us.

Donc dans les clairs se ne sont pas normalement des blancs des premières vagues hindous malgré que les hautes castes ne se mélangent pas trop. Y a eu des faux zooastriens de perse plus des souffi chiites sunnite d asie central, d Afghanistan et de perse qui sont devenu hindous apres avoir été influencer par leur mauvais esprits plus peut-être des huns venu pas longtemps avant les arabes. Une fois que vous entrez dans la cours des djinns sa peut partir loin. La preuve aujourd&#39;hui avec certains kabbaliste complètement ravager du cerveau ils sont totalement manipuler et soumi. Bah nous on reste soumi à l&#39;islam El hamdoullilah

Extraordinary voice shreya mam

I love this song

Dola re dola re and this is my all time fvrt

Excuse me ??Indians do u have special pills for dancing been learning this dance steps for the past years  I haven’t get the leg raise right 

Bad song

এই সিনেমার নাম টা কি,,, আমি দেখতে চাই

it is amazing how they didn&#39;t forget to add the rumbling sounds of the fire when the camera is passing near the fires... for example in <a href="">3:15</a>

Pinga means dick in my country tho️

Bollywood wants this type content now

Two queen in one frame 

Salam two stars of Indian cinema

Saagio shewta tiwariko lekar hum bohot tension mein. Oska aak v shadi sahi nehi hoia. English culture ka larka dhoondo oor shantika shadi do.Osko kam nehi milta. Meri vai beheno duniaka saabse khubsorat insaano mein. Aanjjise jada khobsorat kuch aaj v nehi dunia mein. I am so thankful to indian government  because i get u all from the most top and high ranked  officers of the India. Most powerful biological fathers of the India. India never spoil a single egg of my mom. U all are Super rich. Without shewta tiwari. Jenifer winget. A a baano minister baano aap saab..



Me pareció bien, pero no buenísimo, creo que nada le va a ganar a derola, de aishawria y madhuri, la coreografía era más difícil por así decirlo, aparte que ellas dos se parecían más

Shreya will give voice to which of these two?

Wah shriya g kamal ha ap mind-blowing  voice.

very very beautiful!!

From egypt so much love  such a beautifull

This song is amaizing, my daughter is doing this dance for the kenya music festival

Just can&#39;t take eyes off Priyanka. Absolutely breathtaking!

I just love Priyanka&#39;s expressions on &quot;mere jiya mein utari, tune pehni piya ki katari&quot;. Kashibai from heart...

On a scale of 1 to 10 how badly will this movie break my heart? :)

Priyanka nailed her character.... Deepika portrayed Mastani but Priyanka lived her character of Kaashibaai .. Love you PC 

Priyanka 

𝘽𝙚𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙮 𝙊𝙛 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙝𝙞 𝙇𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙪𝙖𝙜𝙚

Pahle history padh lo FIR movie banaoHistory  ko barbad kar diya

I don&#39;t know but for me Priyanka did the choreo better then Deepika. She didn&#39;t miss a beat

Hermanas de leche

Nice song 







Super

Indians I&#39;m in love with you

Even after all this time... Bajirao Mastani is an unmatched classic movie &amp; though Deepika ma&#39;am - ranveer sir nailed their characters immaculately.... This will forever belong to Priyanka ma&#39;am

PC has danced well on Marathi beat 

Love Did ... from sri lanka 🇱🇰🇱🇰

Lo

Unbelievable dance

Спасибо за вашу песню  я  поднею танцую соло

I think background dancers work more harder than these two heroine

Какой же это с визуальной составляющей эстетичный и красивый фильм А музыкальные сцены заслуживают отдельной похвалы

bonita canción

Pura pinga la cancion

T

That <b>pinga gapori</b> par is just the thing 

did you notice the resemblance between this song and dola re dola(from devdas). one actress is miss world another is portraying a mistress in movie. both directed by sanjay leela bhansali one is in Bengali, another in Marathi

Les.

2023

Both are deevaas



Rani padmavati [Padmavati devi] showed  courage , strength , braveness and skill fulness that srilankan girl Has. I think the price gift that india recived from srilanka is padmavati devi.

they should&#39;ve left bajirao and gotten together

না ই চ

This is a first comment section which appreciates everything--&gt; the actors, backgrounds dancers, singer, choreography

Priyanka&#39;s eyes 

1 Nacho nacho of girls

I still don&#39;t get it. Is it mastani&#39;s imagination or she actually went there to dance with Kashi?



Watching now may 10 2023, hello from Suriname 🇸🇷

Hats off to Priyanka and DeepikaTwo Legendary actress in one frame 

Vaishali mahde&amp;Shreya ghoshal

Priyanka is looking more beautiful than Deepika.

Pinga the booty pinga the booty pinga the booty pinga. That&#39;s all I hear and its funny. Catchy and funny

Life of game khelte tym

Couldn&#39;t take my eyes off Priyanka my God

Most wlcm after 07 years 

Can&#39;t believe this song is 7 year old now in 2023....but Deepika and priyanka still look the same️..time flies so fast



What amazing camera work!!!!

pinga en español significa pen..e  <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>

Gives Dola re vibes

Hi! don&#39;t worry.. you&#39;re not the only one listening to this masterpiece in 2023!

omg i cant belive why is it always mr Sanjay Bhansali giving the best music movie choreo and  cast he is marvellous hope to see more directors in india with such a rich taste

Deepika is a great actress and amazing dancer , but Priyanka Chopra showed the difference in levels... Ngl even in the dance that was visible prominently.

My cousin first heard this song as Ninja Hatoori.

The choreography was amazing fantabulous magical 

Gave their best...but no one can beat Aishwarya and Madhuri bonding ️

The choreography from <a href="">1:00</a> is SO GOOD, and the music!!!? This is done so well I love it

Bollywood and hollywood dono jagah dono ne dhamaka macha rakha hai.

Bhai ye song bna kon ra h... masterpiece 

Deepika looks so clumsy and stiff dancing.

I was trying to dance this exact choreography. <a href="">1:30</a> min I am in and I am all sweaty, tired and what not. My legs hurt. You can&#39;t fathom the energy unless you try it.

nadia sinh is great at dancing too!!!

Just finished the movie, this scene remains the best

Priyanka is beautiful

Shreya mam outstanding 

Hiii

Radha rumkmini and krishna story 

T series , please don&#39;t ruin this masterpiece song with  Neha Kakkar

Dola re vs Pinga ?

When two Queens met,  a blast of performance occurred, so phenomenal, Priyanka, Deepika,SLB,Shreya,choreographers n all who participated in the making of this fabulous masterpiece

The songs has a unique calmness in it. Yet you can even dance crazily on it. Unfortunate that it doesn&#39;t have an Oscar like naatu naatu.

Legends listening in 𝟚𝟘𝟚𝟛

To anyone who has not noticed the importance of colour in their costumes. Deepika is wearing bright red colour outfit while Priyanka is wearing a bit dull violet colour outfit. It basically trying to reflect them as one as “new” and the other one as “old”. It has a metaphorical connection, Deepika’s outfit was chosen this colour to symbolise the new profound love and Priyanka’s outfit symbolises as an old love that got faded. This was explained by my dance teacher to her daughter and then she shared it with me. Its beautiful how colours can be used as a way of communicating.

Nice song attractive

priuankas expression and dipikas graceful dance

Really marathi culture is one of the best culture Jay maharashtra

Awesome 

The real magic begins at <a href="">2:17</a>

deepika&#39;s dance with shreya&#39;s voice... the best combo

Nau Song

Just like Dola re dola song

Priyanka Chopra &gt; Deepika

Nostalgia

Bas yahi chahiye life mein, ek sath do nachaani hain 

Deepika dance like a bamboo stick.

PRIYANKA totally overshadowed deepika

AMAZING  I DANCE ON THIS SONG SOOOOOOO EXLENT!

The Collaboration is 

Before naacho naacho most sync dance

Shreya

I don&#39;t know Hindi, but still love this song and coreo. Wow what an amazing pair

My god their acting skills their eyes speaks alot about their character …..one of the finest performances of DP and PC 

Let&#39;s take a moment to appreciate the &quot;diye&quot; in the background

This dance reminds me of dance on &#39;dola re&#39; song performed by aishwarya rai and madhuri dixit 

<a href="">1:13</a>

I watch this all the time and I don’t know anything about this movie

Director Mr. Sanjay sir, must read this comment, the song is extremely beautifully done and they both priyanka and Dipika gave their bestest of best. But throught the song what is unpleasant to my eyes is the difference between their heights, thats making little differece in their moves.. It seems little bit sticky.. Otherwise over all the song is great and beautifully done.. We love your work sajay sir..

Evergreen!



Nice song

Great song ever ️

What a song?

World&#39;s best choreography I couldn&#39;t control my eyes when Deepika madam start dancing

Deepika always nail the dance parts even if it is classical or western, she performs like a pro

Se asemeja al baile de Aishwayra Rai y la otra actriz que hizo de prostituta en la película Devdas

पिंगा

as a maharashtrian and a maratha girl, i love the representation here.

I really miss prianka and Deepika . They were brilliant and mind blowing.

Hats off to cherograper

This quality of production now missing in Bollywood

Priyanka Deepika se badi star h



Aajii

Aaliya anju.

Reedan reedhan pareshan.

Pinga panda.

The only difference between Priyanka and dipika that Deepika dances with body and smile or be tearful... But Priyanka dances with body and face her eyes switched 10 expressions in every step 

Can&#39;t take my eyes from these both ladies still this song gives me ghossbumps 



Kon si movie hai

Who are here in 2023?

Priyanka 

‏‪<a href="">1:08</a>‬‏  i

What a movie it is all emotions are included in this film. Every body behind the Bahubali and RRR . actually it is getting big success just because of promotion and marketing. Other than that nothing is there.

Nice  performance

Two women celebrating one man&#39;s love..so beautiful 

Anyone in 2023 attendance like 

i think even the real queens also might not be  beautiful than these actresses️

In Spanish pinga means dick 

Priyanka is outstanding

The dola re dola of our generation 

I absolutelly lose my shit when indians do their little head bop/shake middle dance, is SUCH a clear human expression of happiness and fun, it&#39;s so cute.

My all time favourite song . What a song,dance,music

Priyanka is looking beautiful



Fantastic song

I cm again seeing d reharchl vdeo on reels 

Only priynka play best Marathi girl role 

Maturity is when you realize this song and lyrics depicts jealousy and sarcasm

This is song when both of them realised that problem is not one of them but it&#39;s Bajirao...

Watching in 2023

Dp is brilliant but Priyanka is class apart

Most amazing women to ever exist in Bollywood

KKK

Bro this is my favorite childhood song i love this no matter which age i am cause I will be 10  this year which is 2023

Shreya is my most favourite female singer

Marathi song,,rada

I love this song very much

Priyanka is so graceful, my god ️

is this marathi dance? why it is using so much of kathak

In this movie only priyanka is best and correct

Padua Re Dinga

<b>Dear parents: Just because your child is smiling at their phone, doesn&#39;t mean they have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they are watching this masterpiece!</b>

This film is so sad to watch as a desi woman. I feel like we all grew up watching our mum, aunts, sisters, cousins or grandmas crying because of their husbands. Men in our culture get away with a lot of things like infidelity which women don’t. We all know a Kashi irl or we are the Kashi

maturity level: realizing mastani was a problem

<a href="">2:17</a>

Casting, costumes, set, direction and many more things to say...SLB movies are always pleasing to the eye

Priyanka Play kashibai character  with our  eye&#39;s 

Priyanka ️

Wahh wahh kya dance hai

Mere piya ki sawari 

Pinga

Priyanka ...so cute ..

Who loves Deepika Padukone 

Wow just wow so much beauty in the dance️️️

I love Indian dance

But prinka is best

I have fewIndia blood . I don&#39;t cut our friendships . But... . I agree to Alexandre Tge Great whose He had God . Be leave All of gods except ATG GOD , please ... . I will love you forewer... . Shukriyya .



The difference between national award winning actress and chhapris group actress

It&#39;s 2023 still vibing on this song

Pinga songs remembered Dhola re song 

Priyanka dance is fabulous 

Her lips smileHer eyes very sad Priyanka Chopra what a performance

Some singer have <b>sweet voice</b>Some singer have <b>perfect control over voice</b>Some singer have <b>ability to hit the perfect notes</b>Some singer can sing any <b>genre</b>Some singer are <b>versatile</b> Some singer can sing in <b>20+ language</b> Some singer can sing <b>classical</b> songSome singer can sing <b>item</b> songSome singer can sing <b>romantic</b> and <b>sad</b> song️️️<b>Shreya Ghoshal has all of these quality</b> ️️️

Who saw this song again in 2023 is the best ??

What Is The Meaning Of This Song 

the women trauma bonding 

#

like me personally i would never dance with the woman my man cheated on me with but as long as y&#39;all happy ....

Gazab Tora Dinga

Like madhuri and aichwarya in Devdas

L

Priyanka is a genius actress 





Priyanka is all rounder 

It&#39;s 2023 who&#39;s listening to this masterpiece 

Dipika dance is next level

Nepotism rocks 

kashibai.....(priyanka) is the bst

We dance in my school in annual day

What does pinga mean thoughhhhh? It&#39;s not exactly a nice word in Spanish

Priyanka nailed it

The way they move shouldn&#39;t be possible. It&#39;s so unreal 

Amazing ️️

Opp hard workysgs

Everyone always talks about Shreya but I think Vaishali definitely deserves some attention as well! Her voice is so beautiful and when she’s paired with Shreya they create magic!

Mein Assam se hoon aur mein isliye proud feel karta hun kyuki humare India mein itne sare state hone ke baad bhi sabke pass apne apne rich culture hai aur sabse important baat to ye hai ki humare sabhi culture kahi na kahi ek dusre se milte jhulte hai

It&#39;s so amazing yrrr bro 

How does the movie end please?

Can&#39;t deny the fact that PRIYANKA CHOPRA overtakes .Can&#39;t take my eyes off from PC&#39;s skills in pinga 

️️️

I m the biggest fan of Deepika mam but in this movie Priyanka mam had done fabulous job ️️️️️.....

Hindi is the best Language on earth , I feel goosebumps each time I listen to India songs , lot’s of love from Nigeria 🇳🇬

Keindahan India Memang Luar Biasa

I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off Priyanka  not because she played &quot;kashibai&quot; which was a truly positive character in the movie  but because she truly nailed those dance steps, she adapted that Marathi grace so well...her steps were flawless and ofc those expressions were everything 

Priyanka+Deepika = Fire 



Grace n perfaction is can see in Priyankas dance.

Shriya ghosal voice is Amazing 

Vera level 

Priyanka fits so perfect in all roles 

I always think that how did Kashi bai had when she knew about Mastani and bajirao

WONDERFUL ️️️My love from Russia ️

Anyone wondering if Priyanka will pass down that talent to her daughter soon?

these both are like modern madhuri dixit and aishwarya rai and this gives me dola re dola song&#39;s vibes i think that&#39;s because both the songs are by shreya ghoshal...

this song alwayss hits different!!!~

Which type of dance is this

OP bot

Most beautiful song 

इल्लज काहीइक क

Aaaaa ME ENCANTA 

Khup mast aahe after a long time mee hee gana aaikte aahe

God knows whether &#39; knowledge of society &#39; wife or loving wife wins

Whom you are watching .. Priyanka or Deepika ...came for Deepika and watching Priyanka for her natural expressions ️

Эти индийские актрисы прям вышка  как глазами могут передать все боль

Why not Vaishali&#39;s name is mentioned in title ??  , I know Vaishali can take over your useless singers , so you&#39;ll not mention her name ? 

Beautiful 

So gracefully done ️...

I love  you

Keep it up Priyanka and Deepika
