Imagine a nail of Catalonia 6 million inhabitants with 70 thousandths of a million Debts and space Cap Marítim or and Air landings again in the free zone with the reincorporation of Customs and 40 years of probation to enter Europe ... L& #39; the only country Solvenia born from the division of Yugoslavia, which seemed viable through tourism and industry for three years in the red and only survives thanks to European aid and the ever-increasing debt for the system international financier. Croatia does not have a sufficient budget to manage airports and airline seats is 50 aircraft leased to Air France !!

CATALONIA IS NOT SPAIN
EXCELLENT !  now every region inside catalonia, declare independence from catalonia also.

wow so many ppl and nobody in the EU speaks about it... but if there are 100ppl  in Kiew protesting against Putin, the EU dictators immediately tell us that Ukraine is suffering from Russia and new sanctions on Russia have to be applied. What a joke democracy. The EU is an empire which has to be stopped and destroyed by the people.

Catalonia is Spain
The European Union is tearing Europe apart!

I'm a free bitch Catalonia..
Who benefits from breaking countries apart? Certainly not the people.

Catalonia is different!!! Go!! Good citizens!!!

Whore Cataluna Hala Madrid
S&#39;alotta people. Looks like Madrid really skrewed up the porridge this time!

if you are the majority why only 3 people chose above your life, screw the kings and queens this is not real democracy

corrupt spain ..

Has the West blamed russians already?

Now do you understand why Americans revere their 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms?  God bless the NRA and USA and Donald John Trump.  You betcha.

go Catalonia go..
Be United Spain. The stance- &quot;free Catalonia &quot; is coming from spouters of leftist ideas. Thats what lefts do, they divide and tore down many countries.

Liberty and justice for all ! And prison for the enemies of humanity.

Uprising sprees?

To hell with Catalonia I have my own problems.

But I can&#39;t understand why Portugal is mentioned.Yes, they were a colonial power, but they relied more on soft power than anything else. They made alliances with local kings, played them against each other, sometimes they dominated large tracts of land using a very small army (and low profile tactics). Just remember they were a small country, with less than 2 million people, and yet they had an Empire in all five continents.659 Views · 11 Upvotes Richard Donkin, Paid up member.Answered Feb 28, 2015They&#39;re fine countries. There is no such thing as an evil country. We could debate whether there are evil people and what we mean by evilness too, but that is not your question. For sure, some people from Spain and Portugal did bad things but you can say that of almost any country.Compensation? As others have said: where do you start, where do you finish.

Steinberger, Cellist, equestrian, Douglas Adams fan.Answered Feb 14, 2015Slavery, as well as annihilation of various native populations in the world, way pre-dates the existence of either Spain or Portugal as nations.So: Bloodstains? Not the first; not the last.Compensation? Not unless they are also compensated for what was earlier done to them by foreign conquerers.How far back do we go here?Perhaps anyone with a modicum of Neanderthal DNA should receive compensation from those with none.823 Views · 6 Upvotes Robert Sprawls, studied at MATC MilwaukeeAnswered Feb 24, 2015Slavery was around long before Spain and Portugal came into being.Colonialism is probably just a modern day extension of empire building, so go back to the Roman empire, Alexander&#39;s Greek Macedonian empire, and on and on.It&#39;s human nature to want to dominate. The Moors conquered Sicily and large parts of Northern Africa, took white people slaves, the women for their sex slaves, etc.You&#39;re trying to find a single source for the ills of these regions, but bear in mind, the Aztecs conquered and sacrificed the captives by cutting out the hearts of the living.What goes around, comes around. That&#39;s the nature of the human condition.

Free Catalonia with every burrito!!

Madrid to Gilyak!!!! He who doesn’t jump is a Francoist!!! But passaran!!!!
In all that is now being blamed for the US forcibly tearing Kosovo away from Serbia, and proclaimed there an independent state.Logic is quite normal- If you can, then why can not we?The same thing happened with the coup d&#39;état in Ukraine in 2014, which has legitimized the United States, the echoes of all this will tear Europe apart for decades.Because you can not go to everyone with different standards, everyone should have the same rules of the game, without exception, the United States broke it, now there is chaos

Independent California and Texas..... United States is a disgusting country

Fuck off Spain. You fucking Nazis!

VIVA ESPAÑA, SEND IN THE TANKS ALREADY!!

Russian Hackers Staged This Event.

When the people fear the government that is tyranny, when the government fears the people that is freedom...Its time for the people to take the power from the kakistocratic governments, let the people decide...

Spain is acting like an abusive husband who beats his beautiful wife for wanting to leave, VIVA CATALONIA AND LOVE FROM CALEDONIA

The People&#39;s voices are heard. Now give them what they want

Remember the great spanish empire? Weren&#39;t the catalonians a part of that? Why break off

Catalonia is not Spain!South Tyrol is not Italy!
Wow! This will be hard to ignore, but the people of Catalonia need to keep this up!!

Globalist Trash Think they are in charge...but they are not!

As long as you dont expel Jews , nations will be at each others throat. Go to nearest synagogue and ask Jews to leave spain

The rich control the world. The poor are expendable.

One day Jesus was walking in a park. A young man came to him and said, &#39;Lord, I am Catalan and wish for my country to be independent from Spain&#39;. Jesus said, &#39;who is the current leader of Spain?&#39; The young man replied, &#39;Rajoy&#39;. To which Jesus said, &#39;It is right that you say Rajoy is the leader of Spain, for Spain has no leader.&#39; Your country is already free and independent. Now go up to Parc Gaudi and give a lost tourist directions to his hostel.&#39; The young man left Jesus, filled with joy and praising God in Catalan as he made his way to the metro station.

Independence now!Viva the Sovereign Republic of Catalonia!

Meanwhile in Venezuela, the US regime is calling for government change while in Spain, they have nothing to say. Fucking hypocrites...

WW3 is coming in the next 5-30 years. The pressure is building all over the world; for all sorts of different political grievances. Once the first domino goes the rest will fall in sequence.

BRAVO , that&#39;s how it is done.

Curious dilemma.  Who wants centralised govt? So what are we afraid of?

Long live the revolution.
viva Catalonia, mariano rajoy is a cunt.

Jesus why did the Spanish Central Government send the Police. Are they retarded. They should have sent the Police to Protect the People voting and then make some small concessions and be over it. But they overreacted and now people are furious.

Fuck Catalunya - you can&#39;t have independence until Crimea and the Donbass officially get theirs, why should <b>you</b> be a special case ?

Independence is not going to change anything there, Catalonia will continue to be ruled by bourgeoisie. Catalans are being influenced and manipulated by zionist media, the only true change can not come from politicians who have ruled Catalonia for the last three decades.

Long live Catalonia INDEPENDENT || *||
That is a fucking <b>beautiful</b> sight to see, the people of Catalan people coming out united to say they will not be beaten by government thugs, they will have their say and be heard. Much love from the UK.MSM probably reported it as a couple of thousand lol.

dont leave the spain! we need you to compete at basketball national team and defeat the U.S

<a href="">#FreeCatalonia</a>Let them have democracy you fascists c*nts!!

Who digs a trap for others ends up in it <a href="">himself.EU</a> open Pandora box with Kosovo.

Best thing to do is with hold sending money to Spain . That&#39;s all that Spain wants. And  have the  United Nations pass a resolution  ordering mediation .

People forget Spain has a king and is a constitutional monarchy

Spain is doing wrong to the&quot; Catalonians  a crimen&quot;  for humanity

I see millions

that&#39;s more than thousands

Malcontents without jobs.

This will just be ignored like everything else you&#39;ve done. At some point, it&#39;s time to break out the guns. I mean you voiced your protest and you were ignored. You voted and it was rejected as illegit. You&#39;ve been physically and verbally attacked and abused... I mean at some point it&#39;s time...

Soros wins again!Another country divided by the commies.

The Law and the Constitution are there to comply with it
Unfortunately in Catalonia they continue with the virus of political anarchy
More than 3000000 Catalan Spaniards are no longer summoned, Catalonia is Spain no matter how much the same people as always want to destroy it, this is illegal and anti-democratic
Freedom for Catalonia!! Macedonia is with you!!

All support against Nazi Europe

Long live Spain.
Kekistan rallies after Catalonia!!!!

FREE PALESTINE!

Fuck the EU and the EU Central Bank! Dismantle NATO! End the wars that have sent millions of displaced persons/refugees to European borders! Remove all foreigner troops from the Saudi Arabia Peninsula! End the war on drugs! Return our world to a time of peace and prosperity.

The only way to fix anything in this world is to publicly execute bankers and corrupt politicians

Good for them...it&#39;s the way it must be done ! Freedom for the masses !

Catalonia belongs to Spain

self-determination... can&#39;t do that in crimea...

Why the hell do we not see this kind of spirit in America?

Free Crimea and Siberia!

Another case of Russian meddling! We need to sanction them some more!

Kosovo = good for the bankersCatalonia = bad for the bankers

Liberalism is brainwashing

Long Live Cathluna
I just want to make sure I understand this proper? So Spain joins the European Union, relinquishes it&#39;s sovereignty, banks, borders, businesses, laws, courts, currency, etc, etc, etc, to a foreign union located in a foreign country, i.e.European Union. Catalan, wishes to break away from Spain so that it can join the European Union so that it can be free and independent. Really?

I want to be happy about this, but aren&#39;t they pro-EU communists?

This is shit, of Course the rest of Spain, the people should vote As well, its their country to. Shouldnt they have a vote IF their country should be divided??? Fuck catalan go to hell

VIVA Spain

If catalunya will leave europe will be full of seperatist small countries despite of france and maybe germany

Million people there

Is Spain heading for a Civil War?

true orange! god bless Crimea and Catalunia

European oppressors
I&#39;m so proud of you Catalonia!!

This is gonna snow all against EU imo

Soros Paid lefties
Spain out the EU and Catalonia in the EU, force against vote must be punished.

Dream on! What they&#39;re after won&#39;t make the slightest difference. They&#39;ll end up as another insignificant region dangling on the arse end of Europe with no power and serving paella to tourists, just like they&#39;ve always done. Their &#39;revolution&#39; is nothing. It is demanding no change except a different flag, and that new flag will have to fly lower than the EU flag.

Catalonia Adelante alive
The Catalan vote for independence is deemed illegal by Spain and the EU. BAREXIT ain&#39;t gonna happen folks.

Even though my President was coerced (in my opinion) to side with Spain, there are millions around the world and in America too, who are cheering the brave and noble Catalonian people. Don&#39;t forget: &quot;First they ignore you, then they mock you, then they attack you, and then you WIN.&quot; - Ghandi. It may not be easy, but victory is clearly close at hand. Better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees. Viva Catalonia.

Free Catalunya.Fuck off Rajoy and Spain

Proud Spaniards showing the world how it&#39;s done. So much respect.

This is what democracy looks like! (stealing the slogan from the wackadoos for antifa) 

Just goes to show how many irrational people there are in the world. Whilst intelligent people seek peace through unity others seek to keep the world divided in a never ending history of nationalist wars and power struggles that have killed hundreds of millions already.

I Stand with a Free Catalonia!!

KGB brainwashed.

thousands? how bout millions..  power to the people of Catalonia

Power of the People  You 1% Elite and their broken system better wake up

Independence for Catalonia!

Canadians need to stand up and get together in the same manner to stop Trudeau from destroying our country

Fake news&quot;&#39;!!!!

Unity of people can bring down every system.

When governments despise the internet.....

Way too many people there. Please don&#39;t let there be a terrorist attack.....

Goodbye Spain.
Lol, I guess the people didn&#39;t appreciate seeing their fellow citizens getting the hell beat out of them for voting!!

Looks like someone needs another little visit from La Guardia Civil...

Long live free Europe, long live free Catalonia!.

Free Spain! Spain is United, cannot be divided!Catalonia is Serbia!

Fuck catalans :p
