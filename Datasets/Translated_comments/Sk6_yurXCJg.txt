You act like ksi
Have better muscular memory dude

&quot;I don&#39;t care, i have hot babe in my home&quot;<b>He&#39;s losing and winning at the same time</b>

anazing
Kinda weird seeing felix dont swear in swedish.

The progess of Pewds in this game is like &quot;The Download is Fricking Me&quot; Meme.

i sub and like pls more jump king

I honestly wish he would try to beat it. The main map isn&#39;t even that long or hard

<a href="">10:30</a> - for the old times sake &lt;3

I have completed it in just one hour on my YouTube channel 

PewDiePie is such a delight to watch!!! &lt;3 :D

<a href="">9:10</a> goat scream

I don&#39;t think you can checkpoint if you can&#39;t die

<a href="">5:23</a> good question Maybe she as well has such huge leg muscles and is better at jumping

The sound when you hit the ground after a fall makes this game so much funnier than it should be.

I finally got the babe. And i watch this smugly with the dopamine rush still permeating my body. Life is good.

Someone please tell me what he says in Swedish at <a href="">10:32</a> please… 

tf this didn&#39;t get recommended to me til now; also pls continue this

Karanj
there will be blodshed

This game reminds me of Pogostuck where Markiplier absolutely lost his marbles at. Still think that is one of the worst rage games ever made.

the nickelback shirt ties this all together fantastically

colosal drain more like colosal pain
Jump King is AaaSss

<a href="">0:00</a> At the start of the video, immediately don&#39;t tell Marzia productions

That Cry was just Epic

Hey pewds, did you legit lose from that game, that is the first game you didn&#39;t finish I think. Whoa that&#39;s huge

<a href="">4:44</a> My motivation 
pewds u never revisited this game huh

Finally Zero Deaths

Who&#39;s here after watching carrys meltdown

I started coughing and Felix told me to shut up <a href="">1:51</a>

actually 0 deaths lol :D

This game is sooo bad

<a href="">5:15</a> i did the same thing lol

Most stressful gameplay ever
The world has gone to shit since this game came out.

You were so calm man! Keep it up

<a href="">6:10</a> task manager
Of course this gets recommended now

You give up to easy

Why do people watch this shit?

It&#39;s fun and painful to watch

Uh

Cool, cool, cool, cool
Imagine markiplier playing this

what is better then Swedish rage

The little girl voice is very jarring

<a href="">13:00</a> I love this voice you can just tell he&#39;s regretting everything xD

when you realize he looks younger here than when he plays getting over it.

Felix: <b>swears in Swedish</b>Auto-generated captions: <b>MNM out of victims Japan stop</b><b>y e s</b>

Does anybody have any idea what the background music he uses in his videos that sounds really happy

Please tell me what he said at <a href="">10:32</a>

This is so far, <b>the most amusing playthtough</b> I have ever seen

<a href="">5:02</a> &quot;why you...&quot;&quot;Why you bully me&quot;

&quot;I have hot babe at home!&quot; EPIC

It’s so hard to watch

Lmao As soon as I laughed,Peers: Shut up!  
Holy mid rolls Batman

Honestly want to see more of this game

Love his reactions. Laughs, then rages. Literally the same as any gamer male playing any difficult game like this. And the fake crying once in a while too. And also the random sounds at each and every jump. I just love seeing the gamer come out this entire video

<a href="">10:30</a> <b>REVERTS TO PRIMAL FORM</b>

You know its gotten bad when he starts swearing in swedish

Happy New Years everyone!
<a href="">8:23</a> really made me laugh

This is why felix should take a break.

If you pick your nose than eat it. than poop it out IN the toilet than eat the poop will it taste salty? -asking for a friend

R.I.P  PewDiePie
Who else finds it funny when he falls down?

pewds raging is the funniest thing ever

It’s good to see Pewds returning to the days of screeching and grunting as commentary

This is the reason why I sometimes hate games with platforms...

Basically just like Dark Souls.

hello everyone
<a href="">7:04</a>Felix: I&#39;m not taking any chancesAlso Felix: Takes a chance and misses the platform

Let&#39;s say he does get up there. Let&#39;s say there is a cut scene for when he gets up there showing the smokin hot babe and all her glory. Her sexy blonde hair glowing in the sun. She turns around to finally reveal her creamy, orgasmic face...It turns out to be that same old man that was there from the start with a wig on...

This video is one of the most priceless on YouTube. Seeing the character fall flat on its face is just insanely funny

I’m getting flashbacks of a man in a Coldren and a hammer by his side

we need more of this

At <a href="">8:25</a> the dude is laying down on his facePhysics

I would probably take a gun to my own head after trying to play this and failing this much

<a href="">9:11</a> when u accidentally stubbed ur toe in to the table

<a href="">8:21</a> me when mom said there’s food at home

Pewdiepie 3 minutes into the video: <b>AAAAAAAH</b>

We need more

Wait what game is this

<a href="">4:44</a> - always get back up<b>Falls back dawn immediately</b>

𝔧
When he’s filming videos marzia probably scared because he’s just screaming every three seconds

Can someone please translate Felixs rage for me please?

Getting over it pt 2?

Wasnt this named „leg reveal”

It&#39;s Getting Over It all over again...

At this point he has turned into a MANIAC

what the hell.. <a href="">10:18</a> - <a href="">10:28</a>

The face slam IS KILLING ME 

You play these games with your gaming pc

He gonna be so mad at the castle above, took a part of my life damn

When felix curse on swedish... You know it&#39;s serious

pepeLaugh TeaTime

Pewds is 83.Got it?Scroll down if you don&#39;t knowYOU&#39;RE A BOOMER

so this is a 14 min video of pewds slowly going insane

i&#39;ve never been this stressful in my life

Please do more. I&#39;ve never laughed harder at any of your videos

Notice me pewds senpai

should be titled: <b>Felix slowly loses his sanity and becomes something not of this earth</b>

Getting over it pt. 2 questionmark?

this just reminded me of the era when he put on a bald cap and had a sledge hammer

When he says I’m not taking any chances. Falls all the way down

I can’t stop laughing whenever he messes up and falls all the way down

Newest comment

Visual guide to the stonks market.

me: (angry and yelling and hitting my desk over a microphone that won’t record due to stupid windows 10)pewdiepie: (same anger over game)me: this brings a smile to my face :)

You know it&#39;s serious when he starts summoning Satan in Swedish

Next thing u know the man gets  inside a pot and climbs with a hamer (arm day)

Hey pewds, I personally would love to see you play something like, AM2R, I understand that wouldnt really preform as a video all that well but, it would be awesome to see you grow and get better as you get farther. or Super Metroid. Both highly acclaimed games. Maybe consider if you see this comment!

The grammar in the title ._________________________________________.

Felix when he holds back from saying the &quot;N&quot; word:

FiX It FeLiX

Pewds starting to look like stifler!

As same as getting over it
You know shit gets real when he starts swearing in swedish

I like how when he falls in the game he just like slams on the ground 

I request Swedish translation of <a href="">10:34</a> !!! Swedish 19 year olds, help me out please!!

Love how &quot;calmly&quot; he says in the end that he doesn&#39;t care, and then ends it with says that he has a hot babe at home
