We need carpet bombing of Raqqa, this den of ISIS crap, and Shaddadi too - in this city of warehouses and equipment the ISIS have immeasurable quantities

Eh, they would just as well fuck a bad kuev
Drop the ODAB-9000 already
Again some wasteland was bombed. 720 - cool! Now itâ€™s at least clearer that there was no one there.
yah ! 720p!? Are you seriously ?!
filming from space?
MO when is there already a video from the Mi-24 shooting at enemy personnel!? Or will we have to wait for the video from the Iraqi Mi-28NE and Mi-35M??????????
How smooth it is (the video has no brakes) and everything is clearly visible!
