Joomo~~~!!
🇰🇷0-2🇯🇴☠️☠️☠️
Where was the goalkeeper for the Germans

World cup winner: off from the group stages

if germany won this match even 1-0, they would have been through

2018: South Korea beat Germany2022: Japan beat Germany (and Spain)

One word : Overconfidence !!

Send an assassin because you lost? Just take Cleans with you~~~~~ㅠ.ㅠ
Revenge of this match: Jurgen Klinsmann😭

Here, too, he scored two goals in extra time. He continued to score in extra time at the Asian Cup.
Germany are going home from this World cup

Come Here after epic comeback againts Australia yesterday on AFC Qatar

Ranked #1 team eliminated in group stage... ouch

my 12th birthday (as a german)

Germany played with the Mexican outfit

Neuer now plays as a midfield player 😂😂😂

I came to review Light Hyeon-woo.... He is still the light.
I came here to purify my eyes after watching the Asian Cup.
germany is out!!!!!

Bismillah, come on, sty
2030 : Germany failed in North Korea

mesut was scapegoated after germany failure of this WC, but you can see their problem wasn&#39;t on him at all.

Ozil Gundogan Neuer Müller is there and his winning form is crazy.
Hope he gets his first title with his country
Please keep our Heungmin coming to the World Cup ❤❤
South korea:has squid game in moviesNorth korea:oh yeah we have ut but in real life

Germany and Italy are teams with a great history, but in recent times their luster has faded
Germany, ranked first in the FIFA rankings at the time, has been going downhill ever since.. Just looking at the members alone, they would have advanced to at least the semifinals, so I can't even imagine how shocked the Germans would be.
What was keeper doing?

Till this day i cant wrap my head around this

As usual in the World Cup, Son Heung-min runs wild in the final round of the group stage.
1943: germany failed at russia2018: germany failed at russia

I love son heung min it is héro the south Korean

Incredible son😍😍
Complete garbage performance n team selection on German part

<a href="">1:22</a> It was irresponsible on Kroos' part. <a href="">1:35</a> But Neuer's was clearer than Kroos's.
YEAHHHHHH KOREA, KOREA, KOREAAAAAAAA

Why was Neuer there 😂😂😂

The speed of my son, who scored the second goal, did not decline at all even in the extra time of the second half.😮

I am proud and shining of the Korean national team, who did their best in the round of 16. Touching❤ I could see the fighting spirit of the Korean people that protected the country among powerful countries for thousands of years😂
Thank you Korean brothers for defeating Germany, these Germans will forever feel entitled to dominating Asians and constantly dating Asian women while labeling Asian men as feminine. All Asians should stand together to combat white male supremacy. Fighting!

South korea👏 🇰🇷
Korea was sinking... but sinking with the former world cup champion !!!  hahahaha

Who are here in 2023 ...... Fan of Germany football team 🇩🇪 ( EURO 2024 GERMANY 🇩🇪 VS FRANCE 🇨🇵 THE FINAL 😉) 💚

I remember being so satisfied back then that Neuer finally got punished for leaving his line in the world cup. That guy was so frustrating to watch as a supporter of the opposite team during the &#39;14 wc

what was that Germany goalkeeper doing

The 2nd goal ended Germany&#39;s whole career

I occasionally come back for this video. Germany was the defending champion and ranked #1, and South Korea&#39;s performances in the two previous games were underwhelming so I thought it would be an easy win for Germany. Living evidence that if you keep pushing forward, miracles indeed happen.

The saddest thing about this lost was how Mesut gave his all, created chance after chance, watched his team missed sitters, while carried all the hate he got for political reasons. Only to end his national career with immeasurable hatred by the very same people he gave that joy in 2014.

This was 5 years ago... My heart warms every time I see it...
Feliz 🇰🇷🇩🇪🇯🇵🇧🇪

This WC had one of the best group stages ever. Better than 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014 easily but Qatar did overtake it. I remember watching this at my office in central London and the entire multinational workforce were cheering for Korea and happy that Germany were out

Funny fact: After the game, Son Heung-min and other South Korean players cried tears of joy because they thought they had advanced to the round of 16 (they had to beat Germany by 2 points), but when Mexico lost the game to Sweden, they cried. became a mirage.Funny Fact 2: Mexico, which lost the game against Sweden, was resigned because there was no chance of Korea beating Germany by 2 points, but when this came true and advanced to the round of 16, they checked with all the Asians around them to see if they were Korean. They were treated as brothers, and it became a hot topic that a reporter for a Korean broadcasting company who was covering this heat was kissed by Mexican women during a live broadcast.
Foolish Germany!  😂 Over excitement had hampered them

Although I failed to advance, I was very proud of beating the last World Cup champions 2:0.
SLAYYYYY

Even after lost, germany still not accept, Asian better than them

Did Germany used all of their goals on Brazil that one time or what?

Neuer now is playing as midfield player 😂

Korea  vs Germany  2 - 0  World Cup  2018

The dedication of Korean defenders!

Korea is also amazing

Brazil national team and messi curse germany

2018 was a tough year for Germany

As a Korean, to this day I don’t understand how Korea won this game

Dude Manuel Neuer😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 <a href="">1:35</a>

This game is a reflection of the politics of RAFG in this country.
🇰🇷 Fighting
Who’s here after Germany out of wwc?

Aaand the Korean Women’s team did the same thing in this year’s Women’s World Cup 😂

Germany futbol fans must hate us 😂 sorry ya&#39;ll

2023: Women&#39;s World Cup Korea equalise Germany, and Germany fails to proceed to knockout match

De javu 😂😂😂
Again Korea did it in 2023 women disqualified Germany l😂

I won&#39;t be surprised if Germany banned Korea from traveling to Germany. Because it got like a pain now it has become a conflict.

I am here after the south Korean women team kicked Germany out . thank you South Korea men &amp; women may you always bring joy to the world  and kick Germany again in the next tournaments

In 2023 women world cup, the Germany was eliminated in the group stage after a 1-1 draw to South Korea while Morocco beat Colombia 1-0.

2018: Korea Republic men&#39;s team eliminates Germany from the World Cup2023: Korea Republic women&#39;s team eliminates Germany from the World Cup Deja Vu

Here after history repeat itself with both Germany &amp; South Korea for their Women Team this time 🤣

It’s a delight to watch Germany lose

2018 World Cup: Korea exited from the group stage but the Koreans brought Germany out of the game as well. 2023 Women&#39;s World Cup: Korea also exited from the group stage but once again, the Koreans also had to bring Germany out of the game as well. Same vibe.

South Korea is Germany&#39;s killer 😂

came back to this after south korea womens team tied germany to knock them out of the group stage 😂🎉

Korea and Germany are out again.Germany is afraid of Korea

Who is here after South Korea 1-1 Germany from Women World Cup?

Women&#39;s world cup result reminded me of this game.

mulker needs cooler ...
Sweden beats Korea Mexico beats Germany

Germany vs south korea 2023 women this time must be a coincidence impossible for South Korea women to eleminate Germany while moroco and Colombia ties 1:1

Neuer become no ear no year

&quot;Two nil, that is it!&quot; 😅💀

They would beat Japan 2-1 but if they played in 2023 they would lose 3-1
Korea 🥅⚽️🏆
Germany😂😂😂
And with Spain 2-0
If Korea played Germany in Qatar the score would be 4-0
If anything, this world cup has the best match highlights. 2022&#39;s match highlights can&#39;t compare

the Brilliant Korean coach is Sin Tae Yong.

Come to think of it. 2018 FIFA World Cup, South Korea met Germany in the last round of group stage. 2023 FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup, South Korea is also going to meet Germany in the last round of the group stage. Coincidence.

I’m not Argentine but as an Argentina fan I would just like to say, thank you South Korea. 🇦🇷🤝🇰🇷

Hawn-empire become again

My old man said it was payback for the 7-1 they pulled on Brazil in 2014.

Everytime they wear green kit they lose

A match in which Korea defeated the world number one at the time in the World Cup
A video you never get tired of watching
I hate Germany very much and whenever I am sad,I come and see this video :)))))))

In Korea, this game is called the Miracle of Kazan. As a Korean, I am proud and proud. I think Korea is capable of defeating the defending champion Germany. Son Heung-min, Korea's proud soccer pride, played in this game❤Although they failed to advance to the round of 16. However, Korea is my proud country❤🇰🇷
Sty shines now it's dim
Korean GK was like Emi Martinez

I&#39;m feeling happy.

No. The reason why it&#39;s count was the pass before from Kroos so there is no offside at all

<a href="">1:35</a> neuer is now playing as a midfield player!!

Four years have passed since then, and Germany has been crushed by Korea's neighbors and rivals, and has been eliminated from the group stage for the second time in a row by being outscored by Spain...
Whoever sees this highlight in 2023, too!
5 years the champion curse never ever Germany never lost😮

Happy 5th Anniversary of this game! 🇰🇷🇩🇪23

What was Neuer thinking man 😂

Arguably the most entertaining game in the 2018 World Cup.  Just incredible.  Bravo Korea!

It&#39;s common germany lost in Russia 💀
Germans didn&#39;t know this is just the beginning of their nightmare

Argentina

The first ever World Cup game I ever watched

No one cares about Germany 🇩🇪 😂

2018:Russia 2022: Qatar 😢
Son❤
After beating Brazil 7-1, we prepared for the worst Germany ever.
This day Germany got embrassed 😂

imagine if some korean says their team gonna beat germany in the next world cup back in year 2014 Must be crazy &amp; hilarious to hear

&quot;There is no Neuer!!&quot;
Almost 5 years later, and Neuer playing in midfield gets me every time 💀☠️

This game is crazy.

This is what you germans deserve after running up and spitting on us swedes when you scored the winning goal against us in the 90+5th minute.

Why was neuer playing in midfield?

The important thing is an unbreakable heart
Lets say germany is failed to qualify for the ko stages 2 straight wcWhat about italy they failed to qualify for 2 wc( i am a italian)

Mesot ozil was the guy who gave world cup to Germany but now without him Germany can not win any match 😂😂

Korea’s goalkeeper last year was amazing really.

I love you Jeong Hye-ran
Commentator name?
Korea played very well and I hope my country Iran can play well like Korea in world cup.

Beating Germany in soccer is a really happy thing. Congratulations to Japan too!
Now, 4 years later, I am watching this game again, but I still think the Korean national team players are great. I am very proud of this performance against a strong German national team.

At this point, it seems like it's really an Asia-only neighborhood book lol. Please do something fun against Saudi Arabia or Iran in 2026 too.
<a href="">1:39</a> where is the gk?

2018group stage 2022Group stage
I don&#39;t remember watching this match before but I wanna ask. Why is Germany goalkeeper all the way up in the field at the end instead of defending the goal?

Biggest loss for germany shameful

2018 defeated from asia  team south korean2022 defeated  from asia team japan

Now Germany don&#39;t want Asian team in their group 😂

South Korea dragged Germany out of the group stage in this match.

<a href="">1:10</a> the german team was absent mind.

South Korea was very happy, even though they also go home with Germany.. 🤣🤣

So embarrassing to win a world cup then 4 years later not even making it to the rounds of 16.

As a Brazilian I have a lot to thank Korea, Germany is paying for 7:1

Neuer you are a legend! Now its time to give the new generation a chance to shine.

the disrespect to know your going home but wanna bring the favourites down with you

I even beat Portugal with this buff
I am Korean. So I was so moved and excited when I beat Germany

the only one i feel bad abt is özil

gERMANY failed twice in 2018 and 2022 to pass through second round. Whats the issue? If one notices germany never plays like germany! this is because the new players are not foddered from typical german school of football thought.The 2022 team no player is German origin.

<a href="">1:56</a>

Super Crazy Korea Team. They sank No1 German Team. Sonny thumbs up!!

4 World Cups and you are still little yellow goblins

Where&#39;s the guy who always comments &quot;Arg has Messi, Por has Ronaldo but Ger has a team&quot;? 😅

Death, taxes and Werner missing chances

Is this stadium in Stalingrad?

All thanks to Thomas Müller 2018 and like 2022... thank you Thomas Müller
Son Heung-min♥️♥️♥️🇰🇷
Oh look Ozil is in this team ☕

Number of views ㄷㄷㄷ
This match was obviously fixed with the Oppas scoring 2 goals in injury time

Korea

This is how Mexico lost to Sweden haha.
When I think about it now, Germany is just a neighborhood book. Please do it again in 2026. To Saudi Arabia or Iran.
Germany can&#39;t seam to get a break... anywhere.

Germany Goalkeeper what u doing

It’s official. South Korea vs Germany vs Brazil = 🪨 📄 and ✂️
Germany seems to have become a real neighborhood now.
Son Heung-min received a lot of racism in Germany and he said he was glad to revenge to Germany by what he likes

<a href="">1:38</a> legendary
I come from 2022 to say that Germany are out in the group stages again in Qatar

Hello
After Portugal won in Qatar, I came to watch it again.
2nd goal by Korea I m very shocked Germany performance 0% very bad Germany

<a href="">1:58</a> that Ozil face is something came out after a tough beating from someone... A really defeated expression. And i love it 🙂

Kim Young-kwon first goal win rate 100%
I'm sure Germany was number 1 in the FIFA rankings at that time, so it's even more amazing.
Han Bandu is the best patriot. Thank you Ronaldo.
Neuer sweeper keeper more like cm <a href="">1:36</a>
Let&#39;s go!! 🇰🇷🇯🇵
If you blame it all on one player, of course you aren&#39;t going to improve. Thank you German national team for showing us what failure and hypocrisy looks like.

Remember, there’s always an Asian better than you.

Now Japan beat Germany too 😂

Well play ozil

And yesterday Korea beat Portugal 🔥

2018:🇰🇷2-0🇩🇪2022:🏳️‍🌈1-2🇯🇵

Revisited after winning against Portugal.
I skipped out a lot of saves by the SK keeper while Son did miss quite a bit. The keeper was the MVP.

As of 2022, Germany goes home before 16 round is no longer a surprise. They still didn&#39;t get better this time

Let&#39;s face it. Everyone tried this with their goalkeeper on either FIFA or PES as a kid 😂

Bit Hyeon-woo... He blocked 28 out of 28 shots.
Ozil Best

Japan &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Korea

Today, Garmany is out Qatar 2022, in Group Stage. The WC is wonderful.

How did Gomez make this squad? 😆😆

Fast forward to 2022 Germany for the second time exit the world cup in group stages, is it bad luck or they&#39;re curse?

Who&#39;s here After Germany vs Costa Rica? 😁

South Korea the beast

South korea is best 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
This time Costa Rica.

We gotta give a lot of credit to Son Heung-Min. To catch up to that ball at the speed he was running and to get that perfect touch to hit it in. It&#39;s a lot harder than it seems especially considering the magnitude of the game; the world cup against Germany, the defending champions, with a win meaning you send them home. Well done.

What&#39;s the name of this commentator ?

Hope Korea can beat Spain in the last game..go Korea👍👍🇰🇷from Indonesia.. and make Asia Proud👍👍

I laughed so hard when son scored and noone was at the net 😂

this year&#39;s world cup, Germany lost to Japan

Son 😍
Korea republic goals 😍😍😍
South Korea Sorry for not supporting at first

Last time South KoreaThis time JapanYayyy!!

I can do it too
Korean 100 let's go

So surprise Korea won this game but couldn&#39;t go to tournament. Mexico, Sweden went to tournament back then.

<a href="">0:08</a> that save was actually amazing world class recovery by neuer

Now they need another miracle against Portugal - another European Team?

When I saw Mesut Özil, I realized that it was just for the day.
And now JAPAN 😭🤣🤣
Germany lost to Japan this World Cup as well. Germany is vulnerable to Asian countries.
<a href="">1:35</a> how I liked that goal

Manual neur playing for korea

The day that the whole world was happy. Except for Germany.

It comes every time I run out of soup ㄹㅇㅋㅋ
But remember 2014 Germany 🥶
Came back to watch this after seeing Germany lose to Japan.

I come from 2022 to say that France has broken the curse of world champions in Qatar

May be Germany will go home again2022 world cup japan will send home

Congrats Japan 🇯🇵🇰🇷👍
I am one of korean but almost no one expected that Korea will won.Even Korean and in Korean betting the possibility was almost 0.2% but korea did it😄

France is breaking the curse this time around!

Well played korea 💞

history repeats itself

Cant believe, 4 years ago ozil was a top player.

And now they’ve done it again in Qatar!

Who&#39;s here after watching Japan&#39;s dramatic comeback vs Germany??

Here after Germany fumbled to yet another asian team this time Japan

Hello

Neuer playing as a midfield player feels like out of a fifa game

Apply the same logic of that first south korean goal to the Belgium V. Canada game then Canada should&#39;ve had a penalty after hazard passed the ball back

I remember watching this when I was in last year if highschool, literally one of the best matches I&#39;ve seen

🗿Too many referees in the game

Well all I can see is Germany better do not play asian teams

Olivia blamed, boto!🇺🇲
Who’s here after Japan beat Germany 2-1

Asian soccer is strong!!!!!!!!!!!!

Waves are coming to Asia!
Germany is too easy

Now japan!

Almost 4.5 years later, Japan gave Germany a second consecutive FIFA World Cup defeat! Seems like the AFC has replaced Italy as German football&#39;s new boogeyman in international tournaments!

I hope Korea does its best too! I'm rooting for you 🔥
What are you doing in Germany, Lee Sae-gi!!
Thank you, Germany, for making a fun game.
Japan has given a jolt today 😂😂

here again to celebrate another asian wave ‼️

Hey you idiots ㅡㅡ
And this year, Honda beats Mercedes-AMG when AKB48 defeats Germany with Heavy rotation.

After all, Japan and Korea are brothers. 🇯🇵🌅🇰🇷
2018 0-2 German🇩🇪 South Korea 🇰🇷2022 1-2 German🇩🇪 Japan 🇯🇵2026 0-2 German🇩🇪 China 🇨🇳2030 1-2 German🇩🇪 North Korea 🇰🇵
The Germans then committed the unthinkable mistakes —especially Neuer— they tried power play to wage one final battle against Korea and Japan.They fought ferociously,but were utterly defeated.They didn&#39;t realize that times had changed.Facing one defeat after another, losing   Their prestiges and watching their nation dwindle.

Victory for Korea four years ago and for Saudi Arabia and Japan this time! Definitely, Asian soccer is evolving!!😆

Japan not only cleaned the stands, they also cleaned the stadium😂🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🔥🔥👏🏻

I'm glad that Germany practiced hard for four years and was able to take back one point from Asia 😊
germany too easy 😂

Spain is already in trouble. How did Germany become like this? I'd like to hear Cha Boom's opinion.
That was disastrous but hey, at least be optimistic. Germany won&#39;t lose to any Asian team in the future, right?

2026China 2 : 0 germany

Who is here after Saudi Arabia beat Argentina? Football magical moments!!!

Now Saudi Arabia did the same to Argentina 2022😁😁😁

16+ LV

The national team was criticized by the public for performing poorly at the level of an elementary school soccer team in three games in the finals. It is shameful to be happy about defeating Germany, which was on the last defensive end.
Brings back memories when South Korea embarrassed Germany and knocked them out the world cup in 2018.

At this time, it was truly the best ever ㅠ Let’s achieve a miracle in the round of 16!
I also came here after listening to Jungkook's song. Heungmin is crying.
I came to see Saudi Arabia again after watching the match.
I came to watch Jungkook and saw the sixth game against Germany in a popular video, and it reminded me of that time, so I captured the schedule. Thursday, 11.24, Korean time, 10 p.m. Fighting players~~ I hope you achieve the dream you couldn't achieve then~~~
I'm coming to Saudi Arabia now.
Can i understand why the german keeper was way on the other side lol

The Korean Goalkeeper was soo focused and outstanding 👏 The sk defenders were like militants

I love korea

🇰🇷 KOR
I literally miss the old Germany-Team, and 2014 line up was the best for sure.

Even without the soup, it was a really good game. Of course, there were things that Germany did poorly, but the squad was so different from Korea that it was a game that was bound to be a surprise.
Hopefully Korea will go to the round of 16 this year and be surprised, it would be nice to see them happy

Germany beat Brazil 1-7 in 2014, and they didn’t get through the qualifying stages in 2018, wonder how they’ll do now

No Germany you are not the best at everything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Nuer acting like he’s playing fifa on easy mode

I remember this when everyone in Mexico were playing bts songs to thank Korea💗

Still remember this lol

South Korea vs German record1994 WC Group 2:32002 WC Semifinal 0:12004 Friendly match 3:12018 WC Group 2:0

No problem Germany 🖤💛❤️🇩🇪🇩🇪💜💜
Don&#39;t forget team Germany

I didn't know if we would win either... .. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Hahahaha 🎉 🇧🇷
Korea is really underrated team.

A chaos that even God could not predict.
Lololol 2022 will be the same

For anyone who sees this, this match gives Korea hope for 2022.  If they beat Germany, they definitely have a chance against Uruguay and Portugal.

Want to find Koreans by sorting comments by newest?
Korean brother, you are already Mexican. Much love to Korea from Mexico 🇰🇷🇲🇽❤️❤️
Korea 🇳🇵❤️❤️
This is why football is the most exciting sport in the WORLD!!!!🤩👍🏼

Korea only one Asian countries beat 3 world champion Italy Germany Spain and euro champion Portugal.

May God protect our country until the waters of the East Sea and Mt. Baekdu dry and wear out. Long live our country. May the Rose of Sharon, 3,000 miles of Hwanggeumgang Mountain, and the Daehan people's path be preserved. That pine tree on Namsan Mountain, as if clad in iron armor, is as unchanging as the wind frost is. Our spirit is strong. The autumn sky is empty, high and bright without clouds. Our heart is single-minded. Rose of Sharon, 3,000 miles, splendid and strong mountain, Daehan people, preserve it for a long time. With this spirit and this heart, we will be loyal. Although it is painful and happy, we will love our country. Let's preserve the length
i want to see extraordinary events like this in this worldcup.

I am a Korean living in the United States and I remember this day clearly. I used to work at a taqueria and all my coworkers are Mexican and when I say ALL of them told me that “I love you and I love your country.” I was happy that they won but it was obvious that it meant more to all my teammates because Mexico could advance to the next round. I have never received so many hugs and kisses in my life. 😂
Most funny part, germany are going home

South Korean goalie Cho for this particular match, was basically Yashin with a combination of Gods&#39; protection.

Germany is not the best anymore

As a germany fan, this was a tough watch. i had started supporting them in the 2010 world cup, and with the 2014 win and fairly solid performance in the intermittent years i really thought they could pull off a back to back win.but, thats the drama of the greatest game. brilliant plays by mexico and korea and, lets be honest, terrible plays by german made their bed. they havent been doing too well since then but i am hopeful that they will at least make it to the quarterfinals this year.

Korea took revenge on Brazil from Germany 😂
Mexicans love Koreans, they are our brothers

Oh

From 7-1 to being disclassificated by South Korea (who also didn&#39;t advance). Last in group table, didn&#39;t play knockout phase. As a Brazilian, I had so much pleasure watching this match. I supported Croatia in knockout phase. Modric was a beast at this World Cup, I look foward to see how is he gonna play now at this edition.

Germany got humiliated lol

I remember this match because there was no goalkeeper

i remember watching this live it was insane

Germany is funny
Koreans neverrrrr give up.Although we dont make it to the tournament, we dont let others qualify for round of 16

Imagine all the Asian people who aren’t S.Korean but stilled got carried by a bunch of Mexicans for giving them the pass for the next stage. Y’all should be happy lol.

I got a feeling Korea will be the next world cup champion

It feels happy that Germany lost against South Korea 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Blue lock vibes
Shin tae yong world cup Korea 2018 Is indonesian coach

<a href="">1:30</a> Germany are going home ~~~~ This is a famous name that will forever remain in Korean soccer history. The Taegeuk Warriors sent the German tank corps home. I hope to see a match like this at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
All we can do is pray this happens again to Germany and they lose again in the group stages!

This world cup was epic, Brazil got to see being avenged by Korea and Korea showing true talent.

Where was the goalkeeper in the 2nd goal?

XD

The Korean goal keeper was like a Wall to germany, which they cannot Break

Defending the World Cup is virtually impossible. Just shows how incredible Brazil&#39;s achievement in &#39;62 was.I would love to see a team like South Korea or Japan go all the way.

I remember back when i was watching this match with my dad who is a german fan. He was like, &quot;wth korea you already lost, just let them score already&quot; and i remember all hope was shattered when korea scored XD Truly an unforgettable moment

Still remember this match. S Korea showed it&#39;s grit against an overconfident Germany. I was so proud of S Korea

Where is the german’s goalkeeper in the second goal?

Shin tae yong

Let's not play against Germany for 50 years!!!...Let's keep using this game....
The assist for the second goal was absolutely amazing 🤩.Many wont notice that

I’ll never forgive the Mexicans losing to sweden

Last match of ozil

Now that is world class goal keeping from korea ❤

very satisfying to see germany knocked out in group stages

Karma played its part 🤣 they humiliated Brazil and the immediate next cup they got kicked out that too  being defending champions

Germany vs South Korea and Barcelona vs Chelsea are David vs Goliath.

I just don&#39;t know how France is gonna be knocked out of 2022 wc

this is more than to be a winner for Korean Republic. the best match ever❤

I guess Germany can&#39;t win on russian soil, how ironic

Man Made History 🤞

I get sick of it every time I see it
Shin tae yong master class

watching still. today is 🇰🇷🇩🇪🇰🇷🇰🇷 🇩🇪9. 3🇩🇪
<a href="">1:36</a> Neuer now is playing as a midfield player 😄😄

It is very outstanding performance.

Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.
It was a match that will go down in history. At the time, Germany was in a desperate state of needing to win, so the general opinion was that Korea had no chance of winning, but I am also curious about this World Cup.
Fuck, I miss this time so much. Will the day come when our country defeats such a strong team in the World Cup again?
Shin Tae Yong ni bosss 😎

I have to come and look at this at least once every two months.
Germany, I'm going to send the boss home

It&#39;s time the rise of Asia..

Humiliation just huge Humiliation for Germany 😁

I can&#39;t believe our country is the winner of this game. That&#39;s amazing!

What a game. Korea were absolutely cold.

If the first goal counts, then it is amazing that the Everton goal against Liverpool can be ruled offside. Clearly shows the mediocre levels of refereeing in the EPL.

I came back to see you again after a long time. I hope this World Cup will have good results.
Neuer outside from his goal 😂😂

No korean will forget this ever...... One of the best group stage&#39;s matches ......

The germans would not have lost if the goalie had not made a run

I asking Germaney u are  remember the 2014 world cup 7/1 It&#39;s revenge the Korea 😂

A horrible day. Before the match, a feeling of dread in the bus taking us to the stadium. Then during the match, I had my head down for minutes because I was so afraid. And looked up to see the Koreans score the two goals.

the goal was empty lol

It's about Germany...
I love it

Very good Koreans, but in Qatar 2022 they will have to lose all their matches, because I have found out that they discriminate against you there when you go to enter the clubs, and it will not be a surprise if in that soccer league in Korea they practice xenophobia :/
On this day, I couldn&#39;t control my joy and banged my head on the ceiling with amazing jumping power. I was so happy that I didn&#39;t feel any pain.And it was the first time I knew that I had such a jumping ability.Will there be a miracle like this in this Qatar World Cup?I&#39;m worried, but I&#39;ll still support my country

Neuer was literally playing outside bru 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂

This is crazy to witness

so proud of this match

son

Who&#39;s watching this now? My subscribers are!

according to croatian korea

croatia vs korea republic

This is not the first time Germany lost in Russia 🤣

but wait Belgium defeat Japan the asian nations

The goalkeeper had to go down to help his team, but he made a mistake and the Korean took advantage.
There is not Austria to save German Who Remember w Germany vs Austria 1982 ?

114 Days to go until 2022 World Cup!

Few will read this, but the happiness of seeing Son today at Totteham is incredible thanks to that last goal, thank you Son for all those congratulations ♥️
Nice match .

Germany would have to win by a gap of 2 goals, otherwise this wouldn’t have mattered. Thats why after the first south korean goal, german goalkeeper came forward to play as a striker. There is no other reason why they would have lost 2-0 to a team like korea

The day Brazil smiled!
People are watching this video over and over again because they are enjoying Germany&#39;s humiliating defeat. 2022 we are counting  on you Japan👍

This game is extra meaningful for Team Korea, since this marks the end of the dark age of the national team.There have been many ups and downs since 2002 World Cup: many managers came and went, and various experiments taken to end the downfall. Of course, during this time Korea won the 2012 Olympic Bronze after the desperate match with the archrival which is Japan; however, the public interest in football in Korea was dropping steadily which was the worst news of all.I remember that moment. It was midnight in Suwon. Everything was against Team Korea, already lost two games and facing the next big opponent we call &quot;the Panzer Corps.&quot; Most went to sleep, many bet on Germany, and only veterans-turned-commentators were saying &quot;Could be worse. Who knows?&quot; I, also lost interest in A matches, was playing video games instead.Nearly two hours later, a loud burst of scream followed by confused voices was heard from neighbors. Bit annoyed, I started watching the stream to find out what happened. I doubted what I&#39;ve witnessed, but the screen was clearly showing KOR 1. The champion was losing. Germany looked so desperate in the last minutes sending the GK front midfield. Then, a long pass to the empty German side. Son followed the ball like a maniac and managed to reach. Another goal! &quot;What the Red Devil magic is this?&quot;Tigers wrecked the Tanks. It didn&#39;t matter that Korea failed to advance to knockout stage; the team brought even bigger. This single game couldn&#39;t crumble the throne, but it left a deep scar on it. Celebration messages came from all around the world, mostly from Mexico and Brazil. Everyone was happy except Germans. What an unforgettable night.

South Korea is like: &quot;if we&#39;re going out, we are taking you with us!!&quot;

The day Mexicans were Koreans.

Best Asian team for a reason 🔥🔥

When you couldn&#39;t buy the referees this time *

very good korean
Proud of korea south.. my country...

Biggest upset in World Cup history since the start of the 21st century with Slovakia beating 2006 Champions Italy at 2010 World Cup winning 3-2 and send the Italians home.

So satisfying to watch.

2002Jun 26
Germany were ranked #1 in the world at this time so it’s no surprise to me that it meant a lot for South Korea.  Plus, I am a huge fan of Son.  He’s one of the best players in the world in my opinion.  I support a rival at club level (Liverpool) but I can’t help but admire how much of a legend he is for Tottenham.  He was easily up there as one of the best players of last season for me.

It's a video that makes me feel good every time I watch it hahaha
Özil was the best player in that team undoubtebly! and they fooked him up

A football miracle
Son is the best

the whole of Brazil liked this
We will always remember this game since it’s shocking that Germany has lost.

Kim of Guangzhou

Ozil's pass was very good but Werner didn't finish it well
Really. &quot;Goalkeeper Cho Hyun-noo's performance in Russia's World Cup was terrible and he blocked Real🌿🌿🌿😁☯️☯️♥️♥️
There should be a trophy along the lines of &quot;Champion slayer&quot; award for the country that eliminates the current world cup winners

😂w😂

😂😂😂😂germany

I was crazy back then
Humiliating, textbook example of overconfidence

that&#39;s the day every east / south-east Asian is South Korean in Mexico.

war crime racism country germany

World cup 2014 : Germany won Brazil 7 - 1 .But World cup 2018 : Germany lose South Korea ( a football team &quot;not strong&quot; come to Asia ) 1 - 2 .The life is a long journey , future and the life of everyone can change , a football team also like it . Success and happy in today , future not sure can hold it .

Son Heung-min is the best🤍🤍
2010 South Africa defeat France2018 South Korea defeat Germany
I came to see Son Heung-min's revenge against Germany after being racially discriminated against.
Son Heung-min (30, Tottenham) confessed that he suffered racism in Germany in the past and picked the match that defeated Germany at the World Cup as the best game in his football life.

 &quot;There are actually many reasons. Other friends can say that we beat the German team, which is ranked No. 1 in the world, so it&#39;s a memorable game for me.&quot;

He recalled his memories, saying, &quot;I went to Germany when I was young. I had a very difficult life that I could not have imagined. I suffered a lot of racism and was in a difficult situation...&quot;

Son Heung-min said, &quot;I think I had a lot of thoughts that I had to pay this back one day while I was going through a very difficult situation (in Germany). In my heart,&quot; he said.

just come back to watch how Son put all Germans in tears for revenging his suffered of racism.

This time the new Germany squad under Flick should win most of their games in the next world cup

Indian Flag , in this stadium what a worldcup and salute to the person and group who raise Indian Flag there 🫡 🇮🇳

im pretty sure oneday asian country will win world cup

This was the game that brought the greatest cheers and joy since the 2002 World Cup...
Anyone in 2022?

Asia 🔥
nice

Whoever said one of the weak would beat one of the strongest
This match marked the end of Germany&#39;s dominance

Let’s try Again 2018, Heungmin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend this to anyone who has been searching for it for a long time!
Maybe it was because I didn't have any expectations at the time, but the result was so surprising haha.
KOREA BETTER THAN WORLD CHAMPIONS GERMANOW 2-0

Hello after 4 years 😌

Wonderful game! Koreans have always been a strong team
The fact that this unpredictable match was kicked off 4 years ago just blows my mind.

Everybody liked that

A match that ignored FIFA rankings.

Germany, Argentina And Brazil are out from Kazan Stadium.

Guys be honest, The South Korean keeper is class

The German people are truly gentlemen, and even after that game, they were not frustrated or angry, but congratulated and comforted me... The true national character shows the advanced nature of the country... Respect 🇩🇪!
I was serving in the military at the time so I couldn't watch the game, but when I woke up and heard that they had won 2-0, I couldn't believe my ears.
How can Germany lose to South Korea?

if this is the republic korea then the north is the empire korea?

😂😂😂😂😂

Wait so germany beat the brasil like 7-1 or something but korea beats germany 2-0 😂

You van see how many assists Ozil did and how many tomes his colleagues wasted his assists...

Korea ain’t playing 😂

I love Korean

<a href="">0:21</a> could have been the goal of the tournament

South Korea played like Mexico did against Brazil in 2014. They went the distance, even when they were counted out.

Brazil will always be grateful to South Korea. 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
How tf did this first goal count and Benzema against Liverpool 2022 didn&#39;t???????????

Poor germany 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a game, all of goals were in 90m more. S Korea just pushing hard at the end.

Fun fact:All 2018 World Cup football matches are of 2 minutes 10 seconds

Impact of losing to Brazil

N then comes malaysia beats south korea 2-1 at AFC cups 🤣🤣🤣

Wow
science cant even explain this match

🇯🇵's neighbor defeats 🇩🇪.
You're talking about world champions, you're bad, the Germans look at the French, they played better than you
I have never seen a goalkeeper leave this goal to go on attack no matter what the Germans
Even though it’s 2022, I still remember Korea’s history.
I felt for Ozil

South Korea just deserved it. I loved your energy and your willingness not to give up until the end. Congrats from 🇩🇪 See you in Qatar!

What Shin Tae young indo🧐

At 2 in the morning, everyone was cheering and it was legendary... Let's go to the round of 16 this time!
The Arab teams are supposed to take Korea as an example. Nothing is impossible in football ❤
literally all Neuer fault (just kidding)

Koreans be like:ik we are going home, but we aint going home alone

<a href="">2:00</a> man the ending outro

I think Japan can also beat Germany. Because we won too
The curse, first Spain then Germany, next will probably be France.

Doping for South Korea.
I love son
Idk why they&#39;re so happy after eliminating Germany even tho they also didn&#39;t qualify

Just imagine if Germany have won this match then we can see another Germany VS Brazil

After K-Pop then K drama then big Korean brands now Korean football team how much more this country has to show us.

I’m Mexican , but I felt like a proud Korean during this game! Can’t wait for Qatar 2022 and seeing South Korea!

Haha, what are the views on this video? Haha, it's amazing. Oh, it was a real hit when they captured Germany in 2018... Kya... That's cool, Bit Hyun-woo!
Why did Nuer play as a midfielder man

If you look at the comments, you'll think we only met weak teams because we captured 1-2 ports. We're meeting Nakgangdu and Nuclear Teeth. Come on, everyone. Haha.
Apologies on behalf of the rude Koreans

Soooon

Commenter : &quot;Can you believe it Germany are going home from this world cup &quot;Germany Fans : 😭😭😭😭

Happiest day of my life

And the second goes and the second goes and it's Korea's goal and it's Korea's goal...
The champions of the previous tournament lost in the preliminary rounds... and even had the added bonus of finishing last in the group stage.In the Japan-Korea tournament, defending champions France also left the tournament with a loss in the preliminary rounds and no goals.
Koreans watching this, come out!
Korea beat Germany 2-0 in 2018, but it is not surprising because they already beat Germany 3-1 in 2004.
The Koreans showed the Germans how to play football...
Jo looks like 1970 italy main goalie Enrico Albertosi
Ah, soup
Everyone wants to show respect to the Korean goalkeeper, still he&#39;s &quot;the korean goalkeeper&quot;... his romanized name is Hyeon-woo Jo (조현우).

O

I saw this with my dad at a chicken restaurant when I was a senior in high school, so I am the winner haha.
<a href="">0:40</a>How?

I admit that there are still Koreans who come to see me.
Nuer is the absolute definition of <b>&quot;I&#39;ve got it bro&quot;</b>

One of the most legendary world cup matches ever.

Innsh Allah Japan 🇯🇵 will be 2nd Asia team to beat Germany 🇩🇪 in 2022. after they  1st Asian team to historically beat South American any opponent team on 1st time Colombia 🇨🇴 in World Cup 🏟 ⚽️🥅 on 2018

I get drunk on soup
I still get goosebumps from this video :O

I was very happy Group F existed 🔥

son is korean ㅎ

After the rout in 2014, I bet Germany were favorites in 2018
still dont understand why they celebrated that hard. They didnt make it into the round of 16 either

I'm Korean. I hope Japan can beat a strong team like Germany and advance to the last 16.
I don't know who will win, but people who bet on Korea out of patriotism that day wasted their money lol.
Wow.... 54 million view

When meeting Vietnam, everyone lost
1994 and 2002 World Cup revenge success
F german
I&#39;m korean. I&#39;m hoping for Germany. Please never let down your guard in this World Cup and do your best against Japan. I hope to avenge Japan for the Korean War. I expect 🇩🇪(5) vs 🇯🇵(0). I hope Müller scores a hat-trick against Japan and Neuer keeps a clean sheet. If you are a German who is reading this, please leave a message saying that you can definitely achieve this.
There is no Son Heung-min in Japan anyway. Against a strong team, you have to attack with a counterattack at once, thinking that you are giving up possession, but there is no player in Japan who specializes in counterattacks, and there is no player in Japan who has the decisiveness to not miss that opportunity. good luck
I want to defeat Germany, so please give Son Heung-min to Japan, oppa.
Costa Rica 2 Germany 1 Qatar 2022 😎😩👿
As a German, this game was a shame for the whole nation.  We would have won the game with all that chances

What a great game of the two but that I take better advantage of Korea Republic against Germany

koreas defence was incredible this day 👌🏼

How many times do you want to save?S.Korean GK: yes.Edit:wow 4 likes i never got this yikes

Germany, don't let down your guard and do your best in the upcoming World Cup. Don't let your guard down when the opponent is Japan, a small country in Asia.
Corrupt FIFA
Today too, I made soup with sabari haha.
Well, just because Korea won, does Germany deserve to try??? This is ridiculous. What? Okay, okay~ So, give it a try~ Is it worth a try or not?~ Since it was Korea, they won. You guys prepare to lose, Japan~ They have never beaten a strong European team in the World Cup. How can they beat Germany? You will never be able to beat them. Is this reality? Realize~
KOREA vs Germany 2- 0 World Cup 2018 *

That’s when he left Leroy sane and took Julian. The biggest mistake in the history of German football 🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ he find out the hard way.

It's nice to come and see you whenever I'm stressed. I have to go to work.
FIFA official account ranked 5th in total views... In fact, as a Korean, I didn't expect to beat Germany... Winning against Germany was a really valuable game, and the calm and gentlemanly play of the German players was impressive!
Let’s not meet Germany for the next 100 years!!... I’ll use it for the rest of my life~~
Again Germany won’t make it far in the World Cup 2022

IT'S YOUR TIME JAPAN 👍
lol

As expected from Korea
Fighting Japan haha
Japan, prove it!
Germany, this time, let’s brace ourselves and pass the group stage.
The competition between the 1st and 2nd place in the world&#39;s high-tech manufacturing competitiveness.

Goosebumps for asians

I heard that Japan was saddened to meet Germany in this group formation.Look, it&#39;s simple, right?

I hope something unexpected happens during the Qatar World Cup. 🇰🇷🇰🇷

Cheer up Japan
Next time, Japan! ?

Rewatching this gem. 🤩 Boy, was it satisfying to watch Germany lose after they destroyed Brazil 😂😂😂

Actually, wasn't everyone happy except Germany?
Germamy lost, but we didn&#39;t win. Mexico did
We&#39;ll surprise the world once again🔥

I want to feel this kind of excitement during the 2022 World Cup. I hope we advance to the round of 16 this time.
The whole world was not surprised because it was not the first time German was defeated on Russian soil 4 years after their glorious victory over France 🇫🇷 🤣 1940 🇫🇷 -1944 🇷🇺 2014 🇫🇷-2018 🇷🇺 😂😂😂

Ozil was magnificent this game, but every other German player was so flat footed and out of it. At <a href="">1:09</a>, you have 4 German defenders just watching this South Korean donnie take his time with a first touch and a finish past Neuer and none of them do anything.

Korea goalkeeper worked a lot

South Korea Kim and Son were glorious players in 2018 fifa and 2002 was the most popular fifa event; the miracle of the Hyundai company supported red evil soccer player and gave a lot of fellow citizens of Korea 🇰🇷 dream, hope to work out. Dreams ☆ Come True Oh Pilseung Korea Crying Nut Hard Rock Music was wonderful around the world with Yoon Do Hyun band Dreams Come True Again 2022 2 I suggest two stars??
2022 still comment,this is favourite match👍🏻

Germamy always choked.

Watching it again, it's a legend...

South Korea deserve a movie
Our Lana climbed very hard in the 2018 World Cup Asian qualifiers in Russia, but this 2022 Qatar World Cup final qualifier was very easily confirmed as the second Asian country to qualify for the World Cup.

What a game indeed....

It's thrilling...
Ma, this is Korea.
again korea 2022 qatar ~ and Round of 16

How did you win?
Love Korea 🇰🇷 from 🇮🇷
This game was won because Korea's defensive players played really well and Cho Hyun-woo made a great save.
As a citizen of the Republic of Korea, I am proud that this video is the 5th most famous!

I think it's really amazing to see Germany lose and react calmly even after being ridiculed by some countries. If Italy had lost like Germany, they wouldn't have admitted defeat so messily.
