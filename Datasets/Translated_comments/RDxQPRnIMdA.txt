Gst

Yeah

This my favourite film out of the whole fast saga brilliant film👏❤

They had opened Supra hatch and it was there promise to fulfill some time later, you aren&#39;t falling for an eternity. Every car for sale comes with those tyres, but not every GTA car looks good with a sun strip.

This is assassins

I feel the fast and furious vibes.

When street racing become avenger lol

YouTube recommend after 7 year. 😘

The last good Fast and Furious movie.

Paul is Brian and Brian is Paul. Two sides to the same coin. Both adrenalin junkies. He loved this.

Anyone know name of song at <a href="">2:19</a>?

Nice to meet you

Good movie

Family Power!

Didn&#39;t die on Tokyo drift died on fast 6
I saw the music vid see you again then saw RIP Paul Walker in the comments, I looked him up and found out he was one of my fav actors and that he died in a car crash, now every time I listen to the song it makes me sad



Paul walker we will be with.

It Sucked Ass and if you guys cried at the end you&#39;re all a bunch of pussies 

Hi 

It seems to be fun!!!!
A vehicle can go through 3 buildings one plane does that and takes the whole building down 

Poor roman
well wat the hell was extended in this ? 

Paul♥
I love you Vin Diesel and Paul Walker but rip

😎fil coins in a bag

Ok what did vin diesel almost die from in the ending scene it couldn&#39;t of been the ridiculous car stunt jump or the crash because he had no bruises or cuts or even blood on him so I&#39;m a assume it was a stroke or a heart attack that almost did the job because crazy car accidents bullets missiles falling from 20 story buildings can&#39;t kill vin diesel he&#39;s immortal right!

Wicked Ride !!

I've watched the film Na at the XXL cinema
The best there is is Paul Walker
Tyrese Gibson&#39;s reaction is priceless.

THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING MOVIE OF ALL TIME



Haha

I love you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Best franchise ever &lt;3! RIP Paul
Check out more movies coming out this summer!<a href="">

why this movie ripping off point break?

Fast &amp;.Furious  

This movie hits home hard. Thank you to the cast and the director for creating such a respectful and touching ending to this movie and for making the best possible Tribute for our Brother Paul that could have ever been made. We will all miss U Paul, U are forever in our hearts. To our brother Vin Diesel I would like to say that, we all love and respect you for finishing the movie which was the hardest thing to do without Paul and having these emotions built up inside it must have been very emotionally challenging for you, just know that even if Paul is gone now U still have family, it&#39;s us, ur fans and we love u all for being strong enough to create this masterpiece of a movie,  we have all lost our brother, I may not have ever met him or knew him personally but he touched millions of lives all over the world, ever since the 1st Fast and Furious I&#39;ve always admired the relationship with every1 as being a Family. I myself as being a true fan feels like a part of the Fast and Furious Family also, and I will live my life with the same love that the F&amp;F family has for each other, this movie really makes you appreciate every1 that&#39;s in your life and gives us the warmth in our heart that we need in this world today. R.I.P Brother, one day we will all get to see u again.

Omg here comes the big thing

Omg can&#39;t wait to watch that best one out now

wait, auuuuuuuuuggggggggh what did you do?!?!
Hahaha lol
Leandro
Dawn and Pauls familey keep good care of Paul i love the vids and the movies and the  cars love you all good job.

Is that Paul ??? or paul brother ??

Best part ever. I love this movie!!

Hum

Why the plane in trailer white and in this black

Why in malaysia here is 18

This video is very best

Why Brian always and literal drag roman&#39;s ass into battle.

Andrella
The 2 guys from tokyo drift need have bigger role in ff8 after they got little bit cameo in this movie. Considering there will be no more o&#39;conner family again. 

Paul walker?

AZERBAIJAN

What is this bullshit?!

in

Toretto, you are the toughest of all together with Braian
Wow i relly wanna see that



hahahahahaha....funny and tense right......
THIS WAS SUCH  BULLSHIT
with your bathroom with boon
I just saw Furious 7 for the 3rd time today (even though I got to see an advanced preview of it last month, and I made a review video about it on my channel, which you can go check out if you want!) - and every time I see it, I&#39;m still so amazed! They did an amazing job :)

They should have a scene like this in pixar&#39;s CAR&#39;s 3

this falling pack of wheels sure defines HotWheels! even more better, what the Lykan Hypersport does later defines Asphalt8:Airborne! Perfect!!!

What a load of shit

money
Rom flouting while they are hijacking the bus lmfaoR.I.P Paul Walker.

Race In Paradise Paul Walker 

It was a good movie. Maybe a little comical. We had the stealth chopper from Zero Dark Thirty, a Hunter Killer from the Terminator franchise. The Rock was acting like a Terminator with the mini gun and Kurt Russel&#39;s team looked like they belonged in the Avengers. Fast Five is the best as far as I&#39;m concerned. 

I love the plane part,it&#39;s so funny😂😂

I saw the happy ending and then when it was over and then it said for paul i started crying

Awesome movie

best one in the seriesR.I.P paul walker

It&#39;s called see you again 

not real ...

the directon is very good stunts are really grate

What did Paul say at <a href="">0:56</a> ? 

Hottttt

Thanks for great movie all thanks 

Ww

This movie won $20,0M at the box office , shit must&#39;ve been really bad ass

IF ONE DAY THE SPEED KILLS ME, DON&#39;T CRY BECAUSE I WAS SMILING- Paul Walker

D poka mother, this movie is good, fucking dog, the scenes
Checky my channel :)

th

Crazy2
I like the video.

This was my favorite scene of the whole movie.

Roman is a pussy 😂

i am gonna go see <a href="">#Furious7</a> tom. April 12,2015

Roman is freaking out hahahahahah



Check out my recent video. It&#39;s a tribute to Paul, I hope you like it. RIP 😪👼

At first this scene was very unrealistic to me but the fact that they did throw cars out of a cargo plane for real to shoot this scene is amazing.

we miss u paul ......  i salute you .... this movie feels like ur stll wth us... thank you from yolanda survivors... 

wwwwwooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooofast and furious 7 looks amazing

so cool
GOD DAMN is it called &quot;fast and furious 7&quot; or &quot;furious 7&quot; because many posters say fast and furious, but the trailer and website only says furious?!?

THE SONG END OF MOVIE &quot;SEE YOU AGAIN &quot;BY WIZ KHALIFA OFFICIAL VIDEO LAUNCHED

Check out my recent video. It&#39;s a tribute to Paul, I hope you like it. RIP 😪👼

wiggle- fito blanko. so cool


Ōikoö88
There is no Fast and Furious family without Paul Walker, your a legend rip🌟😭😪😘👌

I saw the whole movie last week

WATCH<a href="">

wow.. the word bad is like.. not even close..

I saw the movie and I was laughing so hard😂😂

I want to see this movie so bad!!!!!😬

Long trip, hurtful ending. I loved the movie, but just couldn&#39;t stop thinking that Paul is died and last scenes are touchy. However, this movie &amp; other one reviews, trailers and information can be reached in Android App - Movie Hunter:<a href=""> that out.

watch this movie here <a href="">

Roman is the funniest character &quot;Can somebody walk me through what we supposed to be doing now?&quot; <a href="">#RIP</a> PAULWALKER <a href="">#Forever</a> missed!!

PAUL!!!!!!NOOOOOOO :(

incredible

Major spoiler... He dies
I have never seen such a bad movie get this rating on metacritic(6/10). This movie is amazingly awful. It makes no sense, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is terrible, and the action is surprisingly terrible (shaky-cam, lack of focus, effects over actual choreography) as well. It really is a shame to waste money on making or seeing this movie. Amazing foibles: Half CG Paul Walker is like watching a Japanese &quot;real doll&quot; placed in an action movie (sorry Paul). The camera angles and dialogue surrounding him is so surreal. I was so distracted by the efforts to pretend he was alive for the whole movie that I couldn&#39;t focus on the movie, not that you need to focus to watch this nonsense. Also, the plot makes no sense whatsoever. I can&#39;t even describe it. They try to find a device to just track down Jason Statham, yet he finds the crew at every other scene. Also, for some reason they need to drive cars out of a plane to reach a bus transport, yet Jason Statham manages to be at the same place without falling out of plane. Why did they need to do it? They didn&#39;t. This whole movie did not need to happen. Vin Diesel is old, and just rambles on about family and the streets and other nonsense. HE WEARS A WHITE CUT OFF TO HIS OWN WEDDING. Classic Vin... Also, they go to Tokyo as if there is no time interruption from Tokyo drift, yet the Tokyo drift actor is 10 years older than he was in that movie. They really think the audience is dumb as a couch. This movie is just a series of scenes of people lining up for the camera and cars doing the same. 

This producer must have failed miserably in physics class.

R.I.P PAUL WALKER

Probaly my favorite seen

I watched the movie it was freaking asome and still is how they jumped of the plane it was asome and when tjey broke trough 3 buildings that was encridble to awome!!!!!&gt;0 &lt;

i heard in F&amp;F part 8 the shaw brothers grandma kills hobbs than goes after toretto n them. with the shaw&#39;s family dog and the dog brutally masacres tyrese than they drive away in Dom&#39;s charger, they go and pick up some crack, than they rob a military airplane in mid air for an atomic bomb, than drops the bomb on Canada. So toretto and the crew recruit Vern Troyer (mini me) and they roll up to Canada and fuck shit up.

fantasy filmed in reality!!!?
My bae went to see it last night omg it&#39;s 

They&#39;re all BALD Jerry!!!!

The movie was great and all.Till I saw iggy show up and said her one line. Pisses me off

Nice movise you got😃😃😃😃
fast seven

fast seven

Z to it

I love this scene. I use to jump out of airplane for the Army. AIRBORNE 

watch the film I&#39;m not hating on the movie this is just my opinion to be honest i was expecting more i am disappointed there is no reality check at all cars flying,cars crashing and no one end up getting hurt there is no story to the film just one guy trying to get a revenge is just a chasing game only good thing about the movie is the end..

Spoiler, in the movie, Roman isn&#39;t praying and that part is skipped.

You vin desle.  are cool
I like vin des
Nice shower
I am wait this movie is fuking special and ficción too
Elvis Crespo - Gently
This movie is dumb ass fuck

R.I.P Paul walker💞 you will be missed, we love you 💞💞💖💖😭
Went to see it last night, wish I could get a refund, it sucked.

i cant believe people spend money to watch this garbage.

kereen

Just when you think it could&#39;t get any better, huh.

AZERBAIJAN!!!!!!

Why don&#39;t you find the 7 Dragonballs and wish Paul Walker back?

this is the best film ever

this is the best film ever

This is amazing 

shit film

Fuck you Paul walker!

lol

CHECK OUT REVIEW OF FURIOUS 7!
i love fast and furious

Let me guess. One of them falls out of his car. Dom jumps in slow mo and catches him midair, a few thousand feet above ground and then braces the fall by landing on a flying car, which Brian somehow manages to &quot;drive&quot; and steer through the air, just before the car hits ground. Somehow, no one dies.

I loved it, great! !!!!!!!
wooooww., international tiens ID 95295281 Ariawan Dani Prasetiyo who want to buy products / want to be a distributor of international tiens,.

Rest in peace, brother.  We love you, Paul.

amazing
Did they use different planes in the first official trailer and this one?

Awesome

I already seen it . Hands down the best one ever 🙌🙌🙌

wait until I can easily find the full movie on Google:))

Personally I cried at the end. It hit me again like the 1st time I heard about the news. Rest in peace Payl Walker you&#39;ll be missed. The way they made him leave was beautiful and respectful. 

Can&#39;t wait to see it looks boss

Loved it cant cant wait for part 8

Seen it yesterday! Spoiler alert luda cris dies

i love fast and furious 1234567  make and 8 &lt;3

Awesome movie

The movie was ok, but Furious 5 is still better.

Just finished watching the movie. Super awesome. The last part wast the best, i can&#39;t help but cry. Remembering that Paul Walker attended a fund raising event to help the victims of typhoon Yoland here in my country, The Philippines.  Watching it feels like Paul Walker is never gone. Big thumbs up to the Fast and Furious Team. I&#39;m sure Paul Walker is beyond happy with the outcome of the movie. Definitely worth watching over and over again. 

this is crazy as shit they started off street racing husters now there driving cars outta planes :S:S:S

miss u paul
Tyresee and Ludacris are the comic relief in all the movies they&#39;ve acted in. Ludacris should act even more, mostly comedy 

What I think they should do for the eighth movie is have brian o connor son in the movie as coming up as a teen rolling with Dom and the rest of the crew instead of paul which I wish was still alive but that&#39;s one way they can turn the franchise around...idk maybe will see 

oO Thats fu[kin too much for me this time ....!!!! oO

How strong are those fuckin parachutes...

i watched fast and furious 7 and it was brilliant but the last 5 mins i got upset R.I.P Paul your an absolute legend if they do any more films there not gonna be the same without you

this is the best movie ive ever seen

Watching all my collection of fast and furious getting ready for tomorrow morning I know it&#39;s today but people are free tomorrow so we about turn up lol

You guy are so crazy 

We all miss paul

RIP Paul Walker

who else seen the movie and didnt like it or am i the only the previous ones were the best these one was not that good.



Legal

i khow  right

what a gr8 movie n cannt wait 4 fast 8 n comin soon

Fast and furious is a matter of taste
I was expecting him to say &quot;This time it aint just about being fast...... its about being furious&quot; that would be cool

&quot;This time it&#39;s not just about being fast, it&#39;s also about being really dumb and fake.&quot;

Going to watch this today! 

Paul Walker retires, deckard shaw gets arrested, fast furious 8 in New York

Nice movie

Can&#39;t wait to go see this great thriller film

I don&#39;t understand the dislikes, love this movie, but i&#39;m not ready to watch it, Paul&#39;s last movie :( I&#39;m gonna cry my eyes out. Love the action tho and the music is always awesome, I always download the albums

&quot;Tej what&#39;re you doing?!&quot; -Roman

Can&#39;t wait to see it tomorrow :)

Can&#39;t wait to watch this :)

THANK GOD IM FINALY 13

Does anybody notice how sometimes it shows a C-17 globe master and next it shows a C-130? Lol movie mistakes

This movie was so goood so much action, alot of Jason statham. The rock lots of comedy and do I need to mention a Rock Bottom!!

I really hope this will be the last POS movie they make

i already saw it!!!!!!!!!! fricking cool movie!!!!!!!

The music towards the end is an edited version of Decimate by Brand X Music. Just putting it out there.

Gotta say this movie exceeded my expectations, so glad I got lucky to check it out at the special screening. Might even see it again! Go check it when it&#39;s out this Friday!!!!

lol Rome cracks me up so hard

RIP Paul Walker :(

This dude is still pumping the brakes in mid-air like that&#39;s going to stop the car from falling.

Perfect ahhh I. Can&#39;t. Wait.
There&#39;s a reason why shoots are supposed to be deployed SOON after dropping out of a plane with a vehicle... But its a movie. The FaF series was always a good one to turn your mind off to and just enjoy the CGI and vroom vrooms.

Is he going to go shopping in that subaru?

Why did Paul half to die😭😭😭

G.I. Joe 7  :/

NO hello now im just gonna hold it up here, im stayin with the pilot.... LOL Shout opens.

Can&#39;t wait to see it

Perfect

These movies justo keep con getting more and more ridiculousWerent this supposed to be movies about illigal race? wtf 

Can someone just what me through what we sapposed to be doing💀💀💀❤️❤️❤️

bad ass!!!

bad ass!!!!

And here is the most anticipated movie of the year, if not the decade!

Hi yes, this is a spam message. You can keep reading if you want, all I ask is to get views and likes on my new video...Thanks so much!

It&#39;s about being Furious

I don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll cry... I don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll laugh... But on Apr. 3 i&#39;ll be watching this...Still In our Hearts  <a href="">#PaulWalker</a>  

its sad that paul walker died rip born on 1973 - 2013

Tyrese needs to grow bigger balls than Rodriguez. 😂😂😂😂

aye roman you want the convertable....

Total eclipse of retardation

Wow

7 days to go for furious 7.

i cant wait so excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If they really did drive cars out of a freakin plane then anwser back <a href="">#fastandfurious</a>

w0w

The movie gonna be banned in Thailand because dispute between Tony Jaa and Sahamongkol Films ! But where is Tony Jaa.... don&#39;t see him in the trailer.

One thing&#39;s for sure - this movie will make a sick amount of money. F&amp;F 6 made $789 million worldwide. It isn&#39;t a stretch to say that the long-anticipated Furious 7 will probably rake in a $billion (pinky in mouth a la Dr. Evil.)

Fast and furious mehn we will never get enough of you. Crazy action ever.

went from rice rockets to actual rockets

ITS NEARLY HERE OMFGGG

paul :,( 

cant wait !!

omg i just cant wait to see this movie hope its best performance by  <a href="">#vindiesel</a>  n  <a href="">#paulwalker</a>  no comments on <a href="">#dwaynejohnson</a>  though.. 

wow can&#39;t wait to watch this.

Sick ass furious 7 👌 My Best Actor Is Paul Walker !!
really?

Love the movie

watch trailer already get high. must watch this!!!

i cabt wait till april 3

this became GTA: the movie

AWesome

soundtrack?
I RILLY WANT TO WACH IT it is funny when the thing comes out of the car then the car fals out and he is all skerd jajajajaj

Wait isn&#39;t Paul walker dead

Speak in Spanish, there are some who do know how to speak in Spanish.
Why would they have to go out backwards?

To my stunt brothers and sisters and all who worked on the film, I say take a bow.  I seen an article that someone wrote saying it won&#39;t win an Oscar, know what?  I don&#39;t care.  I am going to enjoy the film and going to love it.  Saw every single part in the theatre and I am very pumped for this.

Ff7 is the the best

NO CGI? WTF!

i thought Paul Walker died     :/

1228 people do not like fast cars  lol
Just watched all the F&amp;TF movies back to back to get ready for this one and i gotta say after watching all of them they got me depressed, i can honestly say there isn&#39;t any franchise that ive watched/loved since a kid that&#39;s still going on right now except these movies, these movies got me into cars and basically shaped by childhood and when i started seeing these movies get better and better as each one pasted it got me beyond excited for the future of the franchise. And just knowing that they had HUGE plans for this franchise and now all that is gone seeing as i highly doubt they&#39;ll make more after this one considering paul walker and to be completely honest it just don&#39;t be the same without him it&#39;s just one of those things in life that just really really really sucks and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.﻿

Why did they have to kill Giselle? Her and hans were amazing? 

Every sequel they end up having millions each. why cant they travel first class and buy cars on location they are fooling around.

Verchna

Osm love ot 😗😗RIP <a href="">#PAUL</a> WALKER 😂😂


ahhhhh yeaahhhh

zakaria

Someone tell me who the new girl is suppose to be 😊

cool movie :-)
Haha awesome

whoaaaah....just whoaaaahhhh...0_0..

Can&#39;t wait to release. 

For the last furious put a Delorean and that Ferrari that look like an lambo with a snake ow something. One mow thang remake need for speed

i cant fuken wait .. good bless walker.. omg.

yeah soooooooooooo believable. they are just ruining the movie. FAKE piece of crap!

Furious 7 is a disgrace to Paul Walker&#39;s reputation. What ever happened about the old Fast and Furious about illegal street racing? What have they become now? Bounty hunters being hunted by a private army of some type? Just remember he died in a car. Not parachuting out of an aircraft in an expensive vehicle.

RIP Paul Walker 

Paulll you are so so sexy baby

Lucas black is back wooooohooooooo.

As great as this movie is gonna be, it&#39;s still not going to be the same without paul walker. R.I.P PAUL WALKER!!!!!!!

Statham will have Diesel any day, when Diesel throws a punch, Statham would probably throw 4 in that time period

Help     <a href="">
I love fast seven

I bet Paul walker is fucking proud to be in the fast and the furious franchise 

It would have been hot if both Vince and Jesse made it to the finale. 

☆☆☆  EXTENDED FIRST  ☆☆☆
Who&#39;s ready for this.

man this is gonna be awesome i can&#39;t take it up to Aprildamn Jesus i&#39;m so excited

Where is Lucas Black???

Yea!!! Go !!

So is shaun from tokyo drift going to be in ff7?

I love watching this movie just for the cars

And I thought Paul walker was dead 🙀



Am I the only one who sees there are 2 different types of cargo planes used for this clip and the movie trailer?But the trailer still looks dope.

How is Paul in the movie if he&#39;s dead??

<a href="">1:26</a> Tyrese: i cant do it<a href="">2:36</a> Tyrese: YEEAHHH!!!!
Lol Rome being terrified of the Families semi life threatening stunts just cracks me up#TEAM FURIOUS IS THE BEST!!!! :^)

i wainting for this movie........... :D

jhakkas
Fast and Furious = Point break with cars instead of surfboards....

Awesomeeeeee

can wait on april lvu guys  <a href="">#furious7</a>  

Wow April 3rd is coming fast I can&#39;t wait to see this movie its crazy to how this Movie Series came along way since 2001 my youngest brother was only 1 and he is 14 turning 15 in July I have been a fan these movies since I was 4 and im turning 18 this year jeez where does the time go? And a Big R.I.P to my man Paul Walker he left this planet doing what he loved the most its always the good people that get taken out so early I know for all the Actors in this film probably said its feels very dark filming this movie without Paul Walker they were like family through these films. But one day they will reunite with Paul. And for the haters of these films gtfo here with that its like all wanna do is put hateful words into these people mouths when yall comment something on youtube being ignorant asf. Bet y&#39;all wouldn&#39;t say ah damn thing if yall were acting these films cuhz yall getting paid grow tf up. Hope you actors stay strong and keep moving forward Paul Walker has a good heart and Im pretty sure thats how he wants to see his family very strong very positive and just keep enjoying life you guys will reunite with him

We better get some brian and mia scenes 💙❤️

Why the fuck has jason statham gotta be the guy that loses hes my favourite actor for action movies

Rating: 9.6/10 holyshit!!!!!

sorry for rome

Roman Lmao

Really can&#39;t wait to watch this but will so be sad at the same time 😢

Is shan from Tokyo drift going to be in the movie?

AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What&#39;s the music playing towards the end?

Whatever happened to just being street racers?

Cant wait lov it.....one threw six now...7 will be on my list next..

Didn&#39;t Paul walker die ????
They say that Fast and Furious 314, Part 2, verse 3, the cars will go into space shooting itself between cosmic kites with lasers and stuff. And Vin Diesel will grow hair.

Damn. I think I already know what&#39;s gonna happen. Hope I&#39;m wrong.

<a href="">1:47</a> / <a href="">2:05</a> thug life lol

Love Tyrese, Glad that this character is still around, can&#39;t wait until the movie comes out.

I loved watching. Fantastic.

I&#39;m totally going to see this movie so dope 

W

Yeah :D
I CAN NOT WAIT, OH MY GOODNESS.  I HAVE WAITED AND CAN NOT WAIT  

<a href="">0:56</a> plane is black then at <a href="">1:10</a> Plane is Grey hmm

This is the only series of movies I&#39;ve ever seen where each one has a completely different title:The Fast and The Furious (original)2Fast 2Furious (dropped &quot;the&quot; and &quot;and&quot;, numbered sequel)The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift (original title with subtitle)Fast and Furious (dropped &quot;the&quot;, numbers, and subtitles)Fast Five (dropped &quot;Furious&quot;, numbered sequel)Fast and Furious 6 (&quot;the&quot; is still gone, numbered sequel)And now Furious 7 (dropped everything except that word, numbered sequel)I have no idea if that was even in order...it&#39;s as if they&#39;re TRYING to confuse the shit out of people. Watch, judging by the pattern, next movie will be simply &quot;FF8&quot;. I called that shit.

This movie is going to be a hit! Spots even premiered in Argentina recently.
NO SORRY TO LET YOU DOWN.....  LMFAO!!!
In respect of Paul Walker, I will watch this Show 10 timesPay more for the movie

What a big deal about it, i mean cars from airplane? Military throw panzers and tanks from airplane, or even there was elephant in one movie

I seriously wish I could be in the team meetings where they pitch plot ideas and set piece moments lol. Like people in a room seriously saying &quot;lets have cars sky dive out of a plane!&quot; or &quot;lets have Vin Diesel fly on the interstate and catch a girl in the middle of the air!&quot;

Vedeo in a woman
I can&#39;t wait

Definitely going to watch this the day it comes out 🙈🙊👏🙏😂 ps RIP Paul 😘

Sweet! :D

This is an whole new level man.Can&#39;t wait to see it

RIP Paul Walker

So this movie still won&#39;t have Sean vs Dom in Tokyo...

Graphics look shit though.

Of course the only reasonable way to exit an airplane is in a car.

It&#39;s about being the FASTEST!

COOLEST MOVIE EVER!!!!! Gonna give a like



On my to definitely see list. Aww, Paul Walker, so missed.

Pa crazy!!! This is without a doubt going to be the best movie of 2015!
my birthday is the next day

Muzo Bi, sorry to spoil you but as you see in the trailer he left to Tokyo and then was killed by Deckard Shaw in order to get Toretto to come after him. Basically the plot for the film

Can&#39;t wait for this hoping to go see this.

oh lord....
Exciting.....and at the same time moving to see Pablo in the phenomenal scenes
Oh wait... this movie is about cars? :O

oh! yes you are!

that Raid spec 70 Charger is just a beast

Does anyone know the music that starts at <a href="">2:21</a>

if yall make a new one make it about being fast and not furious

ROFLMAO POOR ROME!!!

full flem
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!

So is Sean from Tokyo Drift going to feature in this or nah?

 any1 know the song @ <a href="">2:22</a>?

I feel like I just buttchugged a gallon of NOS energy drink with my eyeballs.

2fast4me

Rest in pepperonies Paul Walker

Hahahahha.., Rome is always scared when asked to do something crazy.!! like in F&amp;F2. &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;
 Im really curious are we going to see the guy from Tokyo Drift at all? And I thought this was going to take more time during the events that happen after Tokyo Drift.

SHIT JUST GOT REAL..........

XD 

I can&#39;t wait to see this movie. Gonna see it the first day it comes out, If possible maybe midnight release! 

Lee Chris Tucker &quot;Damn, he aint gonna be in Furious 8!&quot;

Don&#39;t get me wrong I do like the fast and furious movies but it&#39;s not what it use to be I would prefer if instead of it becoming a movie full of guns and driving out of the backs of plane&#39;s I would like it if it went back to stuff like in the first movie with street race&#39;s and done up cheap cars not lambo&#39;s and ferrari&#39;s

Are you crazy????
The level of spectacle bullshit and forced comedy is increased tenfold in this film.

YouTube Machine915Highbreed

 <a href="">    check it out

Go Brazil
No car, just action film =(!!!!!
Where the hell is Lucas Black? Isn&#39;t he gonna be in the next 3 movies? You would think he would have showed up by now lol

I like how they keep the likes  of the characters throughout the movies. For example, Toretto used muscles cars since movie one and Brian tuners, Roman flashy cars, Luda (don&#39;t remember the character name lol) whatever they get him and Letty follows Dom with muscles sometimes. Han used to go with tuners too

Miss gisele and han 😭 too bad they died

When is it shown in Saudi Arabia? ?
Is Sean Boswell in this....?

This is bullshit. Russia drops tanks from planes. And then there are some fucking cars.
The best of Paul Walker, driving in heaven :(

Damn this movie going downhill since Dwayne came in

LOL I CANT DO IT

I don't know what they're talking about, but they look alike. Very Plow Walker
what a pile of shit

 Unleash Your Potential.. Discover how to be financially free!! <a href="">

I like the whole fast and. Furious series but after number 5 I think it&#39;s just gotten out of hand with unrealistic scenarios, just go back to the roots 

RIP POL WOLKER

I like that Brian likes Tuners but why do they keep giving him these busted ass lame cars? They couldn&#39;t have given him like a 370 or idk-shot in the dark here-the skyline???! Or GTR?!?

hoaaayymm...
Anybody else notice &quot;Dom&#39;s&quot; shifter was for an auto, but the car had a clutch pedal?.....

surprising

Next on the Fast and Furious 8, drifting on the moon...

Fuck! I am absolutely stoked for this :D Damn PW, WHY! :(

Are you serious?!?!?ORLY?!?!
If I watch this trailer one more time. I can&#39;t stop watching none of the trailers.

GET YOUR RIDE OR DIE TSHIRTS AT! <a href="">teespring.com/RideO</a> WEAR FOR THE PREMIERE OR FOR FUN OR TO SUPPORT PAUL WALKER
this is like the stupid assed transformers without the robots gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy

¿Whats the song used at the end?

 the fast and the furious 1 spoof &quot;SUPER FAST&quot; comes out the same day as furious

Roman is freaking out!!!!

The best part about all theses movies is the product placement. And hey guys lets take a muscle car and put wide ass tires on them. What, military didn&#39;t have any hum v&#39;s around?  

The other movies were shite but this one would have to be the biggest pile shite period!!!!!!!

I think this part will get so much money and become as famous and favorite as the dark knight among the other parts in the sequel , watching a movie that has a star  in it who dies before the release of the movie always gets people attention.. I think we&#39;ll see an inspiring performance from Paul walker even if the scenes he did are few..we see people differently after we lose them ..  RIP Paul walker 

It's good
Wow, do you remember when F&amp;F was about cars and illegal street racing?I almost don&#39;t.Fucking cliché

Massive hard on until the end where the guy says &quot;Rated PG-13&quot;, instant movie boner killer.

Ok I&#39;m just going to say it: DO NOT enter those sites promoting a leaked version. Even if they are not malwaring the site or worse, they are at the very least getting money from ads. Do not enter their game.It&#39;s crystal clear it&#39;s a bogus leak, since only the first comment and the one that magically names the site get +250 upvotes, whilst the rest get none. So enter at your own risk, the best way to get leaked vids is through known and reliable torrent sites.Another tell about the bogus accounts is the fact that they do not have activity at all, any normal person likes upvotes comments or writes in the videos, and usually not many people use their full name (and if they do, they will interact with people who use nicknames)You have been warned.

WHY THE STI WHYYYYYYYY

What a scene!!!!!! Incredible. I can't wait to go to the cinema to see it. I hope it's beautiful.
This is wrong on so many levels...

Very cool
Did anyone else noticed that they have changed the plane from the one in their first trailer...made it look more badass. Great example of how much works goes into cgi.

WOOOWW QUE LOCURA 

Hmm! I liked. :)
<a href="">2:26</a>  3rd girl face lol.
I would love to try that one day.

These movies are SO. FUCKING. STUPID.

Just &quot;Furious&quot;? Walker has already been too Fast?

What&#39;s the plan Dom?Dom: I am Groot



THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR HAS FINALLY ARRIVED

It's like McDonald's, unhealthy, but very tasty
Can&#39;t wait to go see this opening day. Less than a month away. 

I BE DAMMNED .. LOOKS FUCKIN EPIC .. RIP PAUL WALKER .. !! SIGH MISS THE GUY 

So when dose Shaun come in to it all

umm... when cars fall out of a flying plane at 37,000 ft, they typically tumble around in the air quite violently...

The original video is Darude Sandstorm

guess who&#39;s parachute didn&#39;t open?

that &quot;rated pg 13&quot; is the worst turnof 

The Crew: The Movie. 

that car with 2 tires on the back.. Go! Tridoron! Type Speed!

that car with2 tires on the back.. Go! Tridoron! Type Speed!

sddedede

Ok this is just ridiculous now. All y&#39;all are tryna do is out do yourselves. 

isnt paul walker dead? <a href="">#conspiracy</a> <a href="">#undead</a>
that was cool and all, but it also looks really fucking dumb.

Whoa!! I knew it Paul walker death was a hoax... He&#39;s very alive!!

I&#39;m NOT waiting for a pirate version of this movie to come out. I have TO WATCH with my homies HD 3D surround system at the movies. JUST SHUT DA F*CK UP N TAKE MY MONEY BITCH!

Please please stop with this fucking shit enough is enough god dam it the first one was enough Fuck

Probably the most anticipated movie of 2015!!



Good, looking forward to the day the movie is released in the afternoon
Then they call <b>me</b> "strange"...
75% of the commentsI thought Paul Walker died!?!??

At first I thought that was Nick Fury from The Avengers when it said &quot;Lies Fury&quot;.

This looks like the movie that would be made for the adaptation of &quot;The Crew&quot;. 

Micheal Bay please stop making movies.

Fully insane but ...Awesome video ... (y) 

For anyone who thinks this is not possible I have personally seen the military air drop 50 ton tanks. The only difference is they do it from a lower altitude and they deploy right away. If you want improbable watch the 6th movie with the longest runway in the world and a plane that take more than 5 minuets to take off.



NOT HELPING   Mark <a href="">9:42</a>-48We are not helping people by respecting their beliefs and boundaries, glossing over their sins, and leading them to their own fate of hell. From not telling the neighbour about Jesus, to the RCC cover-up of paedophile priests and nuns crimes – the actions of covering-up are like blind eyes for convenience and comfort that injures us, the guilty, and any third party victims involved. Help with Jesus Christ.

just throwing a question out there, would it be possible to land on a road perfectly if this event actually happened?

APRIL 3 !

They should just merge Fast &amp; Furious and Transformers and get it over with

If I didn&#39;t know about the Fast &amp; Furious series and someone told me this was one of those fake trailers in a movie I would believe them

This looks stupid. Should have ended it with 6. Way to run out of ideas. Probably not the movie Paul Walker would want last with him in it on the big screen. I could be wrong but come on now, jumping cars out of planes?

Noooo Maaames I want it to come out!!!!
and this was the whole movie...

Statham vs Diesel.  I just don&#39;t know who to root for.

muy wena......

:sees screenshot:DA FUCK IS DIS SHIT
They lost me after Tokyo Drift these movies really don&#39;t have alot to do with car culture no more really it just another action movie with ads for expensive car parts and cars.

<a href="">2:41</a> Retepidifurtin!!Song name is &quot;Brand X Music - Decimate&quot; by the way ;)

was this filmed in or near paleto bay?  <a href="">#GTA</a>  

Im so doing this.....if I can...

One step closer.

So just so you know, those guys were actually cool street racer stealing DVD player and Radio to pimp their car back in the days... And now, they are jumping off a military plane in a car, and they can be breaking any territorial international law doing so, because the government actually asked them to catch some of the biggest drug dealer back in the other episode. And i&#39;m suppose to believe all that shit while I watch it? The first episode were too close from reality to believe all this unbelievable crap.

Looking at the trailers. I would say Dwayne Johnson dies or has a very small part in this movie. Which is too bad. Cuz he is my favorite actor in the franchise.

The movie Terminal Velocity had a similar scene but did it much better.  They actually accomplished the stunt through practical means by dropping a real car from a real jet.  CGI so lessens the stakes. Still, pretty cool scene.

I&#39;ve never wanted to see a movie this badly before

This is gonna be movie of the year. Im so fucking hyped

This is going to be stupidly awesome!😎😎😎😎

This movie is going to be bad ass!!😎

stupid movie, as all F&amp;F movies. stupiiiiiiiddddd!

<b>Paul is now a Walker.</b>

that is GTA V in real life

I will not be pirating this movie. I will pay my respects by watching this glorious master pice at the cinema. Respect! R.I.P Paul Walker 

I am not even sure I want to watch this in theaters anymore. The last movie was already too damn ridiculous, this is heading to retarded.

I should be a stunt double 

Omg there are 7 of these now....

I think this movie is going to be cool 

how long would it take for a 3000lb car to fall from 36,000ft? the car is heavier than a person so ill bet it falls way faster

I was going to make this whole joke about sodium, but Na ﻿

good vid lookin forword to it

This is the shit.

i think caleb walker can play paul

Whats next?

These movies are for fucking douchebags.

Fast and Furious is the new Die Hard.

SUBSCRIBE TO Mi Cana ♥♥♥ (NEWW)

So goddamned sick of this series

looks like absolute shit
september312015

Hahahah very nice

Another awful boring movie with a lame as plot and bad actors.

Lol stunts in this movie are getting so ridiculous to the point where it&#39;s like that one movie The A-Team where they&#39;re controlling the tank in mid-air by shooting ammunition lol

This better not be the last one

Vin needs to get a Life,  this riding movies to Death is OLD!!

Damn! I&#39;m already hooked, this was the perfect scene for the first look, I can&#39;t believe they did Rome like that tho.... Haha

Absurd. There are simply no words to describe what is happening.
What a ridiculous film. 

Fail....

Not exactly how I imagined flying cars, but i&#39;ll take it!

Next month, can&#39;t wait :D

<a href="">2:00</a> hahahahaha
How is Paul walker still alive?!! Bull shit

sorry for letting you off / what did you do BTW WTF HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

I honestly wish in was there in one of those cars in this film ...THEN, I could truly die happy

I&#39;ve waited for furious 7 .. but why in this trailler the plane was black and in the previous trailler the plane is white .. ???

Can somebody please tell me what the song is? Thank you!

that was awesome cant wait

I was hoping it would come out April 10th my birthday, lol.

Can they just make Tokyo Drift 2 already?

Posthum Oscar goes to.. Paul Walker, R.I,P 

Stop making these retarded movies

Who would  dislike fast and furious??

<b><i>Don&#39;t try this at home? I repeat it every day, in the morning instead of charging;P</i></b><b><i>P.S. Cars from The Crew? Plane from GTA 5?</i></b>

That backflip doe

That backflip doe

Awesome Video! Hi, need an extra $300-$500 weekly! Check the link to see what REAL people are doing today! I just joined two days ago! It&#39;s a very exciting website and I&#39;m excited about it! <a href="">

I remember when these movies were about cars and street racing and not some Michael Bay action movie

Is that the real Paul Walker, or a CGI, or his twin brother?

How long do they have to go?! 😭😭
I wonder if this is the proof our govt has been air dropping weapons to isis that Iraq was talking about?  Someone get in touch with Brian Williams, he was in one of the cars so he&#39;ll know what&#39;s going on..well he&#39;ll say he does anyway..

That&#39;s excactly the same scene as Marvel&#39;s agents of Shield. Even the plane looks the same.

Omg can&#39;t wait to see this movie

Cool! Unbelievable
RIP Paul Walker :(

I like pom 1) you read that wrong 2) your checking too see 4) you didn&#39;t realize I skipped 3 5) you just checked to see 6) you didn&#39;t notice your and too is used wrong7) you realized that I&#39;m fucking with you 8) you forgot one thing 9) I&#39;m Batman

CAN YOU HELP ME GET TO 100 SUBS THANK YOU!!!
Unrealistic, as always. ;-)

It&#39;s fake don&#39;t try it gives you Trojan viruses 

I hate it when people ask for likes on their comment. Like if you agree

Can&#39;t wait to this movie comes out

First it was the world&#39;s longest runway, now it&#39;s the world&#39;s longest skydive

Nice to see Missandei from Game of Thrones in this film.  Goddess.Sidenote: this movie is gonna make some MONEY. Paul Walkers last movie.  R.I.P Going to be hard watching knowing he&#39;s gone

RIP..

404 Physics Not Found.

D+

Paul Walker is... ghost rider!!! 

Cool thing about these trailers is...saves me from having to watch the movie!

Don&#39;t fall for the people saying the movie is leaked and to go to a website to watch it for free..!!! ITS A SCAM don&#39;t fall for it.. 

Omg paul walker is so hot

I&#39;m sick of people complaining about physics and realism in the Fast and the Furious movies. Don&#39;t they realize that the great thing about movies is that they DON&#39;T have to be realistic.I mean, I love serious artsy movies that reflect real life, but the fact that there are movies like the Fast and the Furious that totally disregard reality is a fucking sigh or relief.

It&#39;s gonna be hard to watch this movie and not think about Paul Walker.  I think it just really shows how fragile life can be, and why you gotta live every second like it will be your last.  I think Paul did that.  RIP. 

Are you gonna stop at furious 7 ???
There is a different guys, at the first trailer, the Plane was WHITE an look like a CARGO PLANE, but in this extended trailer, THE PLANE CHANGE INTO A MILITARY PLANE !!!, what is going on of this ? Its ok, i think military plane looks more good and strong for this scene better than a cargo plane... but , this mistake, between First trailer and final trailer, show us that the trailer is come to fast... and it show us a little bit confuse from the team. I hope, with the new director of this movie, make the fast 7 doesnt loose the point.

Oh YEAH damnMy life  <a href="">#FF7</a> teamworldwide premiere ..  <a href="">#India</a>  

<a href="">

<a href="">

Anyone think the main guy from Tokyo Drift will be in this movie?

What the hell happened to the franchise? Seriously, only the first 3 are the best! The rest are just piece of shit! I wonder what&#39;s next? Cars in space? Anyway, Avengers 2 and Star Wars will crush this shit along with Jurassic World..

 I still dont get how we got from an undercover cop infiltrating a street racing crew to this.... 

I would have rather seen this scene in theaters I&#39;m sure. God, why do i keep watching these movies

Hallo good
