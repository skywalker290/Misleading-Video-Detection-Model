Armaniiiiiiii

Ri
RUSSIA

At the end we had our REVENGE.

What kind of training these athletes go through to play like that

France from Indonesia

Pavard goal is the best goal in the wordl

Paaaavard 
Best match in that world cup

Di Maria two touch goal the best

Mbappe the Extraordinary!

Extra

Mbappe is very fast during this Match.

Mbape=cheetah
Dumb Rojo. Dk why Man U bought him 

AND MBAPPE

The day when mbappe destroyed argentina

<a href="">1:56</a> this moment hurts a lot bt still he won the wc 2022

I am Argentinian
Mbappe always against Argentina 

most intense match...too many goals., heart breaking for messi , rise of mpabe

Legends surely noticed something after dmaria&#39;s goal 

Commentator name?
Mbappe toyed with Argentina twice

<a href="">0:47</a> messi&#39;s goal automatically turned into a assist  poor messi

They met again

All 3 Penaltina World Cups were robbed, 78 Peru let them win 6x0, 86 Cocadona clear hand ball and 22 fifa gave them one penalty a game (most with no impact) so messi could win a WC...The most r4c1st country in America and the dirtiest in football history ever.

Poor defending by Argentina. The first Penalty could have been avoided. Mbappe already lost the control of the Ball..

I miss this World Cup forever.... ........
Wow its amazing that Argentina were actually leading at one point and managed to put in 3 goals with an absolute shitshow of a team under Sampaoli. Theyve come such a long way since then and avenged both losses in this tournament in 2022. Football can be so cruel and the most beautiful gift ever!

France üá´üá∑
Top 3 best games I've ever seen
This was the best game in the 2018 WC

Pavard‚Äôs goal was the best.

2022 Argentina 
France 4x3 Argentina
This was the best game of that world cup
Di Maria what a player!

Anyone from 2023 where Argentine  has finally won

I can&#39;t watch that Pavard goal without the song Blindling Lights suddenly playing on my hear

Mbaape weldone

This was one of the greatest World Cup games ever. The goals by DiMaria, Mbappe and especially Pavard were things of beauty.

Ikr

Mbappe what a player
It‚Äôs crazy, especially that mbappe scores  2 or 3 times when these teams are against each other.

Arg came dangerously close to forcing it to extra time but France&#39;s Pogba stalled time and ensured his team&#39;s progress. I thought Messi won&#39;t win it next time but here we are. Champions of the world. Never stop believing.

Pavard and Di Maria had the best goal in WC 2018

Messi got 2 assists
Argentina messed up on this game by not having Aguero in for more than just a few minutes.

Argentina vs France is always be the most beautiful match. And then, at 2022 they met again in the best final ever, Argentina won and became a champion.

42% of MBAPPE&#39;s 12 world cup goals have come against TINAs He scored 5

Argentina had a bad start at the tournament. They awoke in this match, but against France, their awakening was a little meaningless, it was too late, they should‚Äôve shown this performance earlier to avoid such a team like France. Anw, best match in Russia 2018 imo

mbappe my best player
.

We all wanted Argentina to win the 2022 World Cup, and when it did we all hated it 
Mbappe 
Anyone know who are the commentrator in this match

Argentina got revenge.

pavards goal was the best volley i‚Äôve seen

Swears. Croatia weren&#39;t a match for France.

2018 France is world champion, and scores the goal of the decade and 2022 best final in the history of the modern World Cup against Argentina 3-3 hat-trick from Mbapp√© and the ultimate trophy for MESSIthe world everyone will remember the France/Argentina rivalry.. üá®üáµüá¶üá∑
What is it  with mbappe scoring hatricks against argetnina 

Now that I see it, the penalty given to France was very well done.
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>

<a href="">1:06</a>

Mess was playing alone he was the only that have hade a big match and the rest not

This match was so sad for me because messi has lose the World Cup and after the match he look like he wasn‚Äôt happy at all

How many future world champions played in this match 

Mbape will be one of the greatest world cup heroes ever I think. His world cup performance is always on another class.

Watching on 26.9.23 just for Pavard&#39;s smoothest goal 

why did he not start Aguero

The last sentence was insane Messi is out of the world cup 

1 penalty never scored in life and a goal that if he tries 10,000 more times he doesn't succeed, what can I say gentlemen. This is France.
i wish this happened in 2022 aswell

<a href="">1:55</a> - Messi&#39;s destiny 
France üá´üá∑ vs Argentina üá¶üá∑was the best match depose Messi losing.

If martinez could play this game as goalkeeper

Mappe is the jr goat behind ronaldoo

if only FIFA didn&#39;t carry argentina&#39;s plastic world cup, france would have won 2 world cups back to back

Kylian Mbappe is  the Best Player in  the World*

i&#39;m argentinian, before this i don&#39;t know mbappe, after that i knew him

Mbappe

If Argentina won this game they probably would‚Äôve choked to Belgium the next game

Greetings Argentina, Represent South American Soccer Much Well

I love you France 

Mpabbe got 2 goals in the row

Argentina to France: See you soon in 2022

Prime Grezmann &amp; Mbapp√© &gt; Argentina üá¶üá∑
<a href="">1:05</a>

Was Romero the goalkeeper? I don't even remember anymore. He ate it up for France's 3rd goal, that one from Mbappe. A jelly to cover the finishes.

And Argentina beat France at FIFA-2022 what a coincidence 

this is what happens in a world cup that doesn&#39;t get rigged by vargentina

The best France vs the worst Argentina and practically without coach the Argentine team knew how to fight, if they continued to listen to Sampaoli they would lose 5 to 0, gg no Sampaoli
Who&#39;s here after the World Cup Final?

Kylian Mbappe is the Best Player  in  the World *

4-2

<a href="">0:31</a> By Mary
Fun fact : if Argentina lost this game the next country who lost was Portugal If Argentina and Portugal battle it would be epic Messi vs Ronaldo but we all know that Ronaldo got out in quarter finals 2022And Messi won in 2022

a new classic is born
What if Argentina won the World Cup 2018 against croatia 

Armani sucks....

Benjamin pavard with the most beautiful goal of the tournament volley and perfect and that against messi and mbappe was 100 percent the best man on the place

Is there anyone watching after hitting the cup?
Embappe &gt; Messi

Messi avenging with a world cup final win 
Stated so far pavard oh how about that! Gloryu&#39;s!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!

I was most impressed watching the match between France and Argentina at the 2018 Russia World Cup. I was rooting for Argentina, but it was disappointing that they lost with a score of 4-3, but thank you to both teams for their hard work!
Look at messie theLook at messie now
Fantastic match

i like how lloris just fall down and says <a href="">0:49</a> ive messed up

The most beautiful World Cup final I have ever seen in my life
Messi still gave 2 assists despite having a bad gameGoat things

I can not stop crying still today. Mbappe makes our dream disaster.

After witnessing the 2022 final, I couldn&#39;t resist watching it again. The level of performance displayed by both teams, France and Argentina, was nothing short of extraordinary. Their captivating performances against each other were truly remarkable.

Wake up to reality in madara voice

If Mbappe took the penalty he‚Äôd have two WC hat tricks vs Argentina

If Mbappe took the penalty he‚Äôd have two WC hat tricks vs argentina

Perfect revenge for Messi
Revenge of Messi was one of the greatest moment Ô∏èÔ∏è

france took them out to win the world cup, argentina took them out to win the world cup.

Dimaria is always a big game player

What a player mbappe is

Argentina vs France = Revenge Taken Successfully Argentina vs Croatia = Revenge Taken Successfully 

Who is here after Messi lifting the Qatar World Cup 2022 ? 

Goat  mbappe 
Argentina vs France in the last 2 WC&#39;s 2 matches 13 goals 2 World cups ( 1-1 each )Absolutely Insane

Di Maria scores to take the lead POV=Pavarotti be like nah ah

Packed has the best goals

Where is Pessi‚Äôs penalty? 

This was the real 2018 Final. &quot;It&#39;s a pity&quot; when this types of games happen so early in the tournament due to just the chance of how the group crosses. No other team was even close to forcing France to play their best on that tournament. Same thing happened in 2022.

DiMaria is not aging well  he looks like a creepypasta 

Imagine if Argentine manager started Ag√ºero than Higuain in 2018. France wouldn&#39;t even advance here.Plus the Goalie is trash. 0 IQ. But it is what it is

the worst Argentine team in history I don't even know how we scored 3 goals
Argentina against France is sure to present a great game to watch 

the beginning of Messi&#39;s villan arc

This match was away better than Final 2022 !!!! Also Aguero was playing !!!

I find it really ironic that I supported France passionately in that match, only to find myself supporting Argentina with every cell of my body against them 4 years later.

Revenge is sweeter 

<a href="">1:55</a> Destiny givin us a hint. Look above Messi&#39;s head

Argentina‚Äôs first mistake Rojo shouldn‚Äôt have fouled Mbappe because I don‚Äôt think he would‚Äôve caught up to the ball it might‚Äôve went out for a goal kick Second: Armani should‚Äôve came up from his position as soon as Mbappe played the ball past Rojo

this is the best match

Kylian   Mbappe  is the  Best Player  in   the  World *

ARG v FRA - Best match of 18 wcARG v FRA - Best match of 22 wc

4 years later Argentina had their well deserved rematch. This France team was unstoppable and the Argentina team France faced in 22 nothing compared to the weak overdependant on Messi they were in 18

Argentina worst squad ever seen

<a href="">1:54</a>I came from the future, look over Messi&#39;s head

Can anyone please tell me the name of the dive by the goalkeeper at <a href="">1:24</a>

This match was entertaining than the 2022 World Cup final

Nice match, but how the tables have turned now‚Ä¶

I think 2018 camera quality better then 2022 Qatar World cup .

iam four you love 
If this AR team had Emiliano Martinez, Ar would have won it!

Pavard ‚Äç
KYLIAN  MBAPPE is  the  Best  Player  in  the  World *

Argentina vs France in last 2 World cup = 13 goals !

<a href="">0:55</a> accidentally goal

Revenge is sweet

World cup 2022 final 

BLUD GOT REVENGE 4 YEARS LATER 
Fun Fact :- Angel di Maria Has scored in every world cup final

Who was the commentrator please

Mbape best flayer
For me Argentina vs France was the best match every world cup

Mbappe has 5 goals against Argentina 

Aguerooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
We are back again MF

It is always insane when you think mbappe was just 19 here. He is truly a football prodigy, we will not see an 19 year performing this level any time soon. His confidence and his shot strength is just clinical

How about that

Revenge Done Ô∏è
<a href="">0:58</a>

Prime France team...Ô∏è
Mbappe kinda carried for France every time they played Argentina

If dibu was here half the shots wouldn‚Äôt have made it lol

2022 3 3  paneltis 4 2 wow

I‚Äôm understanding that Argentina and France national teams are almost exact same level. When they play none of them fully dominate the other. When one them wins, they barely do so.

Messi lost in 2019 against France Messi takes revenge in 2022 world cup Final in penalties

Revenge done üá¶üá∑
Kylian Mbappe Is The Best Youngstar

This was the best  world cup

After this match, Dibu Mart√≠nez probably was like ‚Äúenough is enough‚Äù after seeing 4 years of suffer, and casually decided to change the history of Argentina forever.Ô∏èüá¶üá∑

Best match I have ever seen

Mbappe 2nd goal = di maria goal in final wc 2022

Sweet Revenge 2022

where is emi marteniz

NO Team can Beat France...... Super Powerful Team and Talents....................

2022 could have been the same. But Emiliano‚Äôs leg save pushed Argentina to the penalty shootout

These teams met way too soon in the 2018 wc

Expectations - Brazil vs Portugal, Reality -Argentina vs France

It&#39;s same like world cup final between these two.. Dimaria scoring goal, messi fought till last n mbappe scored two to make difference. But yeah results different

The 2022 world cup final was very personal Messi couldn&#39;t lose again to Mbappe.

<a href="">1:33</a> that pass was downright heavenly, I can&#39;t stop watching it. Pinpoint.

France almost won again but Emiliano Mart√≠nez didnt let that happen

Di Maria kick was sooo sweet and Messi assist to Aguero was amazing they almost go to the final again and also get revenge to croatia

Whenever these two countries clash on the international stage you know you‚Äôre in for a treat

Argentina arrived at the 2018 World Cup in the middle of a managerial crisis, the players were fighting with the coach, they did not speak to each other and they could not focus on the World Cup, it was also a break and end of the cycle. Even so, Argentina played a great game with what would later be the world champion. Today, 4 years later, they faced each other again, Argentina with 19 debutants and a Lionel Messi at the end of his career but with experience and hunger for glory.
Bro what was every goalkeeper here

calling it now france vs Argentina final 2026 world cup

New rivalry???

Di Maria and Messi with Argentina is a legendary combo

The response will be more painful in the 2022 world cup final.
I wonder if Martinez was in goal, would Rojo thrown mbappe down? Cause that last touch forced the ball very far from him and Armani just stood still

corrupt garbage heap

Mbapee was close to hat trick which he did in the final

A player who lost world cup 2018 badly and got wrecked by france but in 2022 he shined up and wrecked france for a revenge and won the world cup

The France and Argentina rivalry is the best

Mbappe‚Äôs double goal and Pavard‚Äôs Volley was astonishing

Haaah. Where is fra ? Where is fra rev has been taken 

What a game!!

Anyone after Qatar World Cup
2018: France2022: Argentina Even Teams  
That last head strike by Aguero was amazing

Messi Won the Wc

It&#39;s crazy to think that the 2022 world cup final could have ended in the same scoreboard from 2018 france vs argentina.

Now We have our Emi Martinez Ô∏èüá¶üá∑&lt;3
France 
France team was so strong in 2018

As a Messi fan this match hurt a lot but watching after the Goat lifted his world cup brings great joy

Back in 2018,no one knew how to tackle the pace of Mbappe.....Now in 2022 the Argentine defenders knew their individual assignments to handicap the whole team to disconnect Mbappe from his normal play

France: Wins 2018Argentina: We‚Äôre gonna do a little bit of revenge in 2022

Mbappe is seriously a dangerous player no way

the third goal and the fourth goal of France.  Argentina you cannot defend with a line of 3. you learnt your lesson. and now you are world champion&#39;s.

<a href="">1:08</a> where‚Äôs he? I didn‚Äôt see him in 2022‚Äôs world cup

the fact that the scoreline could be 4-3 for france again if Kolo Muani landed the shot in...

Who are watching this match after Argentina defeated France in final 2022

2022 final Argentina 
<b>The world cup has been lifted by weighing them after paying the debt</b> 
Argentina truly deserves it

Right now Fifa Win 2022 Argentina
Pavard&#39;s goal is incredible

Funfact:&quot;Both Di Maria and Mbappe scored in France x Argentina 2018 and 2022,also with scoreline

Haha revenge finally served 4 years later

After the 2022 WC its clear that argentina and france really do put a show agaisnt each other.

This was the time when the world noticed a great talent of a teenager called Mbappe, scoring two goals vs Argentina. Winning the cup and scoring in the final was the cherry on top.It is hard to believe that he scored more three goals against the very same Argentina the cup to follow.A great legend is on the making

Revenge Done against France 
Very close game. The only thing missing for Argentina was El Dibu

<a href="">1:06</a> my boy scored from a different TIME ZONE üá´üá∑

I enjoyed that day
let's go Argentina 
Who is the commentator, he&#39;s amazing.Ô∏è

HiJanuary 2023

Man, Martinez and the new squad sure made a change

had it not been for that penalty, the results wouldve been different

2 of the best strikes in world cup history were done this match

<a href="">0:36</a> a crazy goal one of the best in this world cup

Mbappe almost killed Argentina in finals ! But this time France lost ! Argentina finally!!

Who is here after Argentina won their rematch?

Mbappe against argentina is always on another level

Mbappe wayyyyy better than Messi is not even a joke

Bhai a golkeeperer name ki

Perfect Revenge in a perfect place. Smiling face after 4 Years. It&#39;s a treat to watch Messi lift the World Cup trophy at Qatar. Now, they are World Champion. Messi is GOAT.

look how Argentina revenged on both Croatia and France now(2022)

the beginning of this highlights just seems like a start of villian vs hero scence

<a href="">0:48</a> lol Lloris
I rewatch this after the 2022 world cup final

Expected final:

Argentina lost 3-0 to Croatia and 4-3 to France back then. Then in 2022 beat 3-0 Croatia and France in penalties, winning the World Cup. Argentina was thirsty of revenge, simply epic.

So this was the real final in 2018 and we didn&#39;t know it

This is a WORLD CUP RIVALRY. Two world cups two greatest matches  of all time. One for France one for Argentina. EPIC

Don&#39;t worry, in four years and a half we Will have a sweet Revenge !!!! üá¶üá∑üá¶üá∑üá¶üá∑

<a href="">0:25</a>

Mvappe is the best 

Aha..Mbappe have been Argentina tormentor for long time...that explains two minutes silence and other wild celebrations by Argentina players.

France, stop crying. They are sore losers, fags and insufferable people.
It&#39;s technically the game where Di Maria scored against France twice.

Who is here after 2022 final

WHAT A TURN! 999
And that long shot beautiful

I wanted mpappe to win this year he scored a hat trick in final

The Argentina team did this at a time of absolute turmoil. They had a horrible coach and absolute no direction. What a turn they have made in just 4 years. Vamossss Argentina!!!!

That was the very best match of 2018 World cupIt was rather an early final than the round of last 16Even the best goal of the tournament was scored in this match

nice

Argentina vs France is such a massive show

What an amazing match

France-Argentina is the new Classic of football

And 4 years later there was revenge, dad Aguante Argentina, the third time came üá¶üá∑
Another awesome match

Frace vs Argentina is the new El Classico .

And remember , mbappe was 19 back then and had 2 goals and 1 assist 

What a sweet revenge by Argentina in 2022. One circle got completed for Messi to lift the world cup.

I must admit ..now this loss do not hurt... Before I used to hate watching this... But now .. redemption....

One of the most entertaining WC matches ever!

2022 üá¶üá∑
These 2 teams are like football anime rival teams. They bump into each other at every turn and give off an epic match which keeps us all in suspense.

Revenge doneüá¶üá∑
And now Argentina just took revenge on France

I love this. France football at it&#39;s finest üá´üá∑

When it comes to Pavard, i do not know what was smoother the shot or the knee slide.

Revenge taken in 2022 final
Who‚Äôs here after Argentina won

Di Maria and Mbappe scored again in 2022

The revenge has been taken

The revenge in 2022 was beautiful. Chef&#39;s kiss. F off Mbappe!

<a href="">0:22</a> Angel Di Maria
What a phenomenal game, so close to being 4-4, who knows what could‚Äôve happened

Watched it Live on Tv and I was so heartbroken because  of messi But now everthing is changed messi won tha wc against same opponent

Who watch this after the Final 2022?

Messi 
Wow ..Arg has three rivals in worldcup ..Old timers nederlands and France ...now Saudi added to list 

<a href="">0:15</a> he plays league of legends bro

2022 Argentina got their revenge 3-3 (4-2 penalties)

These 2 teams made the best match of 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

mbappe is a beast, he scored two goals against Argentina in 2018 and three against Argentina in 2022.

Honestly I say to myself even if we lost against you Argentinians when our two countries face each other that gives a historical match no matter who wins we are great football nations It was a pleasure to play against you for two cups in a row!

Mbappe scored 3 goals against Argentina in the last world cup and 2022 too

Best match of World Cup 2018 &amp; 2022. üá´üá∑v üá¶üá∑. I feel lucky that this era is my football era.

Seeing Messi sad at the end of 2014 and 2018 World cups was very heartbreaking. But now he&#39;s the 2022 champion and we don&#39;t have to feel sad looking back at the past. He&#39;s certified himself as the greatest ever

For the French, this didn&#39;t aged well

Di Maria is Iniesta for Messi.

Best game ever - together with WC 2022 ARG - FRA final

See this in 2022....
Mbappe utter nightmare for Argentina

Coming back in 2022‚Ä¶.REVENGE 

Emi Martinez was the difference this time.

4 years later these teams played in the 2022 World Cup final, a final for the ages!!!

the turtle has rented us
and 4 years later the rematch was tremendous

Argentina and France ran it back and Argentina got their get back , what a final it was this year CONGRATS TO ARGENTINA üá¶üá∑

The world praises Argentina!

Emi Martinez was the real hero behind arg success...winning 2 penalty shoot out is world class

Argentina is Mbappes dog

And Argentina won the wc this time ,vamos

And now they repeated and Argentina Won it on final and Messi lifted the World Cup!!!!

Vingance
That was before, now it's different
Oks

I have seen them face Twice in world cups and both the matches were epic ones.

Messi: ‚Äúand so it ends, My race has run. I regret nothing, it was fun‚Äù

Mbappe has the speed.Strangely he did not show it in the 2022 final.

2018 wc final was foul no team did their best and 2022 wc final was very realistic and dramatic how best they gave in finals

Peru vs England üáµüá™Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø 4-5

Combined with the 2022 Final, these two countries have just built a genuine football rivalry.

This is the real FRANCE SQUAD, but in 2022, they played without Pogba, Kante, Benzema, and yet 3-3, if Pogba, kante and Benzema are in squad, will crumble the  messi&#39;s dream

What a team both r, came here just after 2022 WC final

Billion association can‚Äôt make a proper highlights more than 2 min. Yep 

France eould have won the final 2022 if Giroud and Griezmann wasn&#39;t  substituted

<b>2018: France knocks Argentina out of World Cup</b><b>2022: Argentina Knocks France out of World Cup and makes France gets 2nd Place</b>

4 years ago it was like that, but now it's different
Messi won 2022

Messi got his revenge, Tho I am sad that the 2022 World Cup was Ronaldo and Messi final World Cup, but as a Ronaldo fan I congratulate Messi.

Who is watching after 2022 world cup final

France-Argentina : 2018 - 7 goals , 2022 -  6 goals (+6 penalties). No need 30 more teams in a worldcup 

After the wc 22  is over , i watch this again

Who is watching again after world cup 2022. Messi rocks

18th December 2022 a day which forever will be etched in everyone&#39;s memory.A day when history was madeüá¶üá∑

Powley
These two teams put the best match2018 was excitingBut 2022 was fire !

Revenge is taken üá¶üá∑ ....don&#39;t mess up with MESSI 

This match was even close tied it with 4-4  scores. There was actually a moment where Argentina accidentally missed a chance in a last few seconds but didn&#39;t shows in this highlight..

Argintina just beat france

Argentina wins 2022 Wc
revenge is successful in 2022

4 years later, Di Maria scored yet again vs France Ô∏è

racist France you have been exposed
Mbappe loves to score against Argentina

argentina vs france is the elclasico of international football

Comeback is always greater than setback

I was rooting for Argentina in 2022 but man that Mbappe dude is kind of a legend himself. Why don&#39;t we hear more from him like we hear from other legends like Messi and Ronaldo? 

Both this and 2022 WC Final we saw unreal football being played. Expect this to be seen whenever france and Argentina clash.  Ô∏è

We didn't have a goalkeeper in 2018, when I saw that CAVALLERO and ARMANI had been called up I said that's it, we can't, since Abondanzzieri was injured in 2006 it is clear that without a great goalkeeper you can't reach a final or win it, you were missing DIBUU
This what we call free flow ball..very entertaining ..that what the worldly people like to enjoy looking at ball moving .Win or lose second matter..Today They luck next time loser luck  that how the Universe keep us learn from mistake...If only one team win all the time there something wrong .Same like how u put on your relation, sometimes u had give &amp; take Not like im Only the Great person in this planet..Hola....

France vs Argentina never disappoints
This match aged well

What a beautiful revenge in WC 2022! 

Hey! 2022 The story is different and Messi lifts the World Cup.

Looks like the game turned upside down for France this year 

Revenge has been taken Ô∏è

France vs Argentina duels, seem to fetch us a high score line with entertaining football - World Cup 2018 and now 2022 

France didn&#39;t deserve the end score of 2022 WC, and deserved to lose much earlier. they got lucky with a penalty call that forced the game into extra time the second France goal was the only that was truly worthy.. they weren&#39;t in this game at all .. for 90% of game .. scoreline should have been 4 something in second half  before 80 mins... MBappe is far from being Messi and this probably  was the last final he will play.. for France.. Argentina shut down the French team that ran other team ragged very well... well deserved.

back here they took revenge in 2022 final messi wins world cup

Today, Argentina has the revenge they wanted.

Messi finally made it üá¶üá∑Mbappe what a great player t√≠o

Anyone after Argentina beat France 4-2 on Penalties after that thriller 3-3 full time? These 2 teams never disappoint.

As a French, I am truly saddened by France&#39;s 2022 defeat at the world cup final, but Argentina deserves the win since France played poorly for 70 minutes and Argentina had the best opportunities. I regret that last shot from Kolo Muani at the very end of the game as we would have won without going into these perilous shootouts. Shootouts are just a coin toss and we lost it today like in 2006. Unlike Argentina which will be weakened by the loss of Messi and Di Maria, France will remain competitive and will hopefully win the next world cup. Bravo √† l&#39;Argentine et √† Messi et Vive la France et Mbapp√©. 

Di Maria knows how to score against France

Mbappe always plays well against Argentina

Who‚Äôs here after Argentina won the World Cup in 2022?

congratulation from France to all Argentinians people... until the 70, I thought we were missing our game on French side... then we could surprisingly come back to 2-2... then you scored 3, then we came back again... on all the game, it&#39;s well deserved on your side, to win this match... hope it will bring joy in Argentina... on French side, we are disapointed, we would have liked to put the third star on the shirt, but for all the argentinians suffering in their everyday life, I am happy for you too... Have fun, enjoy those moments, 4 years ago when we won it, the French streets went crazy during the whole competition (and after the winning too, sure)... it&#39;s great moments to live for a country, to win a football world cup... the best from France, and congratulation again...

Argentina could have won if Sampaoli wasn&#39;t dumb enough to bench Aguero and not taking Lo Celso to Russia. No wonder the players were all furious with him.

Game changed today

The World of CORRECTION!!!! It was not a WORLD CUP, it was a &quot;TRIBUTE to Messi&quot; with the money of the Clubs and fans. It was a &quot;TAILORED SUIT&quot;. The highest Quatari official responsible for holding the World Cup has already &quot;AFFIRMED&quot; At the opening of this "FARCE", his GREATEST WISH would be to hand over the WORLD CUP to MESSI. It was a &quot; CUSTOMIZED SUIT. FIFA has no &quot;morality&quot; to direct football. They have to resign en bloc, like the other institutions (UEFA,...). They demonstrated the level of CORRECTION of these organizations!!!! The SANSIONS of Argentina/Netherlands fell into oblivion. The insults and attacks seen in that match demonstrate the level that FIFA has. Athletes who should be disqualified for UNSPORTSMANSHIP conduct are currently being glorified!!!! OUT with FIFA and its CORRUPT!!!

Messbappe

why yt recomended me today

Why did this get suggested to me in 2022 ...the final between Argentina vs France?? What a coincidence!!!

Now u giving it as a recommendation just before Wolrd Cup Final .. u Naughty Utube 

4 yrs later the two teams meet again for the ultimate glory..What a great match it was... Hopefully this time also it turns around something like this..

We will ask instead for these tearsüá¶üá∑

I can feel Argentina winning the today&#39;s world cup

What a game !  Pavard&#39;s goal is extraordinary.  this match will remain one of the best of the World Cups after the France-Germany of 1982.

I am .... I hope today&#39;s game is as exciting as this one ... only hoping for Messi to win.

Anybody here on the eve of iconic France Argentina finale

If France wins, they should be disqualified and stripped of their title and banned from participating in the next world championship!!! I say that for the reason that the French are originally white people while the French team is over 80% full of blacks, it should also be forbidden for all national teams to lead players to whom they have given citizenship just to play for their national teams!!! There should be a rule that if you are not the third generation of people from that country, you cannot participate in the competition!!! For the rest, it is not fair to other national teams and other competitors, and on top of all that, it is a shame to include foreign players in the team and present them as if they were yours!!! It is obvious that politics is too involved in all possible sports and that is why sports competitions are losing their importance and losing spectators, because politics is too much in place and changes the rules as it pleases, more precisely as it suits certain western countries!!! Count the foreign players by national team who got papers just to play for them in national teams, in my opinion it's cheating and it's miserable and miserable, isn't it?
