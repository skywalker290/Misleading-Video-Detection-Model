The 20s are cured

<a href="">3:09</a> We did it!!wait, is that good or bad?

Its all pewdiepies fault beacouse he didnt meme review covid 19

Lazar beam was also lvl 69 when he killed the ender dragon and WW3 would be on fortnite creative and Minecraft server

<a href="">3:11</a> Careful what you wish for

I built a trebuchet from scratch.

To the genius who predicted COVID and probably has a time machine, I’m sorry we didn’t listen to you, and your patterns.

Fuck the pattern is correct every 20 there is an outbrake

<a href="">3:10</a> it&#39;s all your fault Felix

War is actually great for the economy it’s just bad for the people

Pewds -  Let&#39;s make 2020 the worst year everGod -  Ok Zoomer

<a href="">3:11</a> he sort of did

Just reminding everyone he is the guy that took a shit in a shower

2020 will kill us humans faster than you kill memes Mr Felix

The outbreak meme was ahead of it&#39;s time 

Pewds : let’s make this the worst year ever Be careful for what you wish for:(

Wow that meme about how 1720 1820 and 1920 had a virus outbreak he just doesn’t care about it lol.

who&#39;s gonna tell him?

2020 is just as bad as we thought it was gonna be

<a href="">2:05</a> yup you are right almost 2 million people have died due to COVID19

<a href="">2:05</a> was dot on correct

We know the rules now whenever pewds says it’s going to be a bad year it will so let’s please tell him make the next one better

<a href="">2:07</a>Well, the plague is here...

<a href="">2:05</a> the guy predicted this year

He cursed us

update: ww3 has been put on hold until the plague of the 21st century passes...if you think covid is bad, just you wait till its over

so is pewds the inspiration behind the meme economy memes???

<a href="">3:10</a> careful what you wish for

<a href="">2:24</a>Someone Explain pls

<a href="">2:10</a> i mean....
Felix: &quot;Let&#39;s make this the worst year ever guys&quot;Everyone: Well... We are not that far

R.I.P PewDiePie when the U.S drops more nukes on Japan

Rate the video! Write your opinion!

Remember when we were joking about the 17, 18, 1920 stuff but then realized we were actually right

<a href="">3:11</a> well...i can say that you have succeeded

I have come here from November 3rd 2020. I can confirm that WW3 is almost among us.

i came from future. memes are great but world is on fire. see reference at <a href="">2:11</a> <a href="">3:10</a>

Pewdiepie didn&#39;t review covid meme, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s not dead yet

<a href="">3:14</a>HEY ZACK LOOK YOU MADE IT

a little warning should&#39;ve been nice.[<a href="">2:09</a>]

for someone in the future who is from 2120 is there a plague outbreak again?

<a href="">2:10</a> You are goddamn right

2020: little did they know...

&quot;Let&#39;s make this the worst year ever, guys.&quot;

<a href="">3:41</a> hey, this is someone from the future, I&#39;m just here to say that if pewds would&#39;ve killed the plague meme that would&#39;ve been  nice

<a href="">2:05</a> The guy who made the meme: They called me a madman.

We were all literally in this together in 2020....

<a href="">3:10</a> hm

I know it&#39;s a joke but Japanese colonialism was an actually horrible thing

my grandson studying all the history in 2020 be like:<b>sad anime noises</b>

Everyone here is worried about some dumb shit and I’m here just trying to figure out how people will wear a mask and mass protest at the same time. Grow some balls and don’t pester the rest of us or stay home so you’ll stop being a nuisance to the people who aren’t afraid of the flu season.

Looks at pewds view of 2020: mom, can we get 2020Mom:we have 2020 at home 2020 at home:
