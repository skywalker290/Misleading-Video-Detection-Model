Hey its the Guy that plays Markus in the video game Detroit: Becomes Human!!

This was then, this is now.. I feel the same as I ever did. I think you are grown are you ready I definitely am 🐂♉🔐❤️♌🦁🐾📌 tell me? Guess its going to finish me 😭 I am on your side so no matter what it&#39;s ok..

💖 <b>a u t h e n t i c v i e w s</b> 💖 and Demi Lovato the duo making virals beautiful voice. 🎶🔥❤
I remember this girl.back in 02 If i.could talk to her I&#39;d say I got same Love for all my people no matter what is said. Jennifer Leigh call your Mater

To me it seems like he is a dick because he can&#39;t understand that a girl can have really good guy friends and them just be friends.  Unfortunately that&#39;s how I lost one of my best friends. Her husband or boyfriend at the time won&#39;t let me be invited to the wedding because even though they were together for like 3 years he thought that I might want to be involved with her.  Should I list a 5-year friendship over that

When this came out I was homeless, on drugs, and then jail. I now have a house, job, and husband. This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️😊

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Heart Of A City Boy” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕🎉

You are so beautiful and so strong your music says what it really is Wonderful❤🎵🎶🇺🇲🇧🇷

Every time I see this man, I can not help thinking of him as an android from Detroit becomes human.😂😂

Demi always has a special place in my heart. Her performances showed me what it was like to sing with emotion

As i wss passing her i bumped my shoulder into hers kind of hard....i asked her to get a picture of herself from her parents who wer e visiting her at nu..we were onnthe 4th goor oc foster walker complex...her paren t s were on the ground below...she said that she forgot to ask for the pic...i pushrd her from behind anf told her to go and g e t the pic ftom her parents...she did not fall..only momenarily lost her balance...lori her older sister and ab aka as well expressed her concern thst their parents may.hav e seen me pushHer...jorie gillis...another incident...we were engaged in horseplay...i picked her up...she was laughing all the while...i awkwardly to ssed...dropped o nto thebed...I guess I missed...her knee hit the wood support that t u r matress was resting on....she grabbed ber knee and started  crying...i apologized if recall corre c tly.  No furthe t u happened...we stayed toge there..

Her man is gorgeous!

I GASPED SO LOUD.... THE DEMI LOVATO MUSIC VIDEO LORE GOES HARD.

I didn't like it because when lines appear, it gets boring
Wow ❤❤❤❤❤
You know at the end it is implied that she was the one that left him at the alter not the other way around

I Love it

Omg! Doctor Avary! 😮

please keep it a secret until the time is right to announce it

I just realized the actor from detroit become human is here lol

How is 2024?

Think he left her long before she left him at the alter. Metaphorically he already checked out. The wedding she actually left him.

The message of this song is so damaging for young people and I really hope they don&#39;t make the same mistake of needing anyone but themselves.

heeyy. what Markus doing here

Jackson Avery

Jackson Avery

I love and respect you very much. You sing so well and are perfect ❤
<a href="">3:25</a> What happened to Demi Lovato as of 2024? Did she transformed to black or she died?

Try gospel

I have loved you.

Im breaking through.

They are both so beautiful!! Jesse Williams is absolutely gorgeous!!! Those eyes…oh my gawd!!!

THATS FUCKING JACKSON AVERY DOG

Is that Markus from Detroit become human?

Who is still listening to this beautiful 2024

Give a thumb up 👍 if this song still hits as though it was released just yesterday

I still get chills watching this masterpiece

Lin Ziola - Tell Me You Love Me

I’ve never heard this… ughh the whole beginning of that video screwed with me…

Favorite Demi Lovato song 🎶
This girl knows how to make me cry lol

pretty girl back in the day, now she is an overweight dude trying to figure out what gender and sexuality she is on a daily basis.  dang..

Back when effort was still put into music videos and a story was told 👌👌

The heart must gain more 💓 everyone doesn't want to live a lie..
If you answer yes, I will be a man who loves a woman, otherwise if you love and see the world differently, it doesn't matter if you love the right one..
Her voice beautiful, sensual. Love this. Magnificent singer.❤❤❤❤❤💯🌹👏👏👏👏
The love of my life (Demi Lovato) is getting married and it's not me 😪😪😪😪💙💙💙 12/18/2023
The part where she&#39;s looking in the mirror and singing &quot;Everything I need, is standing right in front of me, I know that we will be alright&quot;....... that line hit hard

I onced peoposed to demi on youtube , back when they uad messages. I was paranoid that i got catfished. I started talking to myself , and my parents put me in a mental hospital. It could of happened. Now i suffer from mood disorders , and i pike to listen to her music , so can can feel loved.

The most FOD@ clip of Demi's career.
I miss this Demi

One of the best clips ever made, I always come back here to watch ♥️

You aren’t anybody until you finally fully always get to have that somebody else in the most lovingly humbly and healthiest of all ways, aspects possible 🙏🏻💯❤️

She’s a natural with the acting and I despise a long intro. But it got me thinking with her background before singing and everything how bad it would be to see her in a big screen movie. Something epic. Marvel maybe idk. Anything honestly. She is a triple threat so….

What love was this she was cheating on friendship she was cheating on him with someone else
YOU KNOW IM HONEST WITHIN FEELEINGS ITS HARD REALLY HARD TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS IT ONCE YOU PISS ME SO BADLY THAT I WOULD FIGHT AGAINST WHOLE WORLD BUT ONCE YOU MAKE ME LAUGH WHEN I LOOK INSIDE THE SMILE IM FINDING POSSITIVE AND WARM FEELINGS ITS HARD REALLY HARD WILL YOU UNDERSTAND POINT YEAH ARE YOU REALLY ABLE TO LOVE SOMEONE LIKE US

My grandfathers nephew from Austrias spirit said this female what is publicly called “Demi Lovato” is a serious criminal and rapes babies and blames it on people of a what is now publicly called “Nordic background” and she tries to claim everything and so on to get away with it and also does different things to get away with it and so on. He says she is just like the other black female from the what is publicly called the group “4 non blondes” that publicly present what is called “a song” called “hey, hey, hey what’s going on”. He also said they are massive criminals and have apt of blood debt and have killed so many innocent people and have hurt so many innocent people and that what is publicly called “Demi Lovato has some sort of agenda to pursue something to do with occupancy in what is publicly called UK. I don’t know what he means right now but he told me to report this here and the try to tell someone the rest.

I fell in love

I love this song ❤

My favorite song ❤❤
But fr DLo…. You’re the queen 👸🏽 of the anthem. This is sick with the clap 👏 it gives you that perfect Demi anthem vibe. Hype, powerhouse, makes your chest feel stuff. Ugh.

Quit kissin my wife 😆

I just with you, I need your love me like a Sue always this mom the pregnant in Kanye West, sake fuckin&#39; honesty yeah, beautiful meditation.

This Actor is the most beautiful 🙈🙈

Yes Demi and myself do love one another truly and we have managed to become much better more mature ppl each having freely worked and always will on those things that we did tell the other if we do ever crossed paths again both completely single that we will feel so blessed honored that we both kept this very sacred loving promise.  So Demi do you believe we could be physically inseparable work constantly as we more than have fun celebrating our new beginnings with those damn anarchists and we will definitely be on the others music. Miss you babe. MB❤

2023 anyone??? ❤❤❤
I always cry when I watch this clip 💔
One of my fave sa BT 105.5 wakwakwakwakwakwakwak!

Demi&#39;s reflection moment singing &quot;Everything that I need is standing in front of me&quot; added a profound layer to the lyrics, truly beautiful and powerful. During one of my Zoom sessions with life coach @lisahaisha, she praised you as the ideal figure seamlessly blending awareness and entertainment. Her transformative guidance involves insightful recommendations, and your mention has indeed shifted my perspective. Gratitude for your impactful work and kudos to you for making a positive difference. Your artistry and the wisdom shared by my life coach have become catalysts for positive change, and for that, I&#39;m sincerely thankful. Looking forward to more moments of inspiration and introspection through your music and Lisa&#39;s guidance.

2023 it still hits🥺
Love her hair❤

LoveIt❤️‍🔥❤️💗
who is the man please, what&#39;s his name 😮

It’s 2023 and this song and music video still look fresh

Am I the only one who realized the guy she wakes up beside is Avery Jackson from greys anatomy?

334-  Never again

That officiator had “that look” like - ya’ll both need Jesus BEFORE you come to this altar.

still listening in 2023 !!!

This is about drugs

Hesitate of the memory with this song

<b>I love the message they give in this song,  to always be yourself and don’t change for anyone.</b>

Holy City is going in for A Thousand Years for conspiring Lisa Alley murder.Cain and AbelLisa Alley blessing on earth. 😇

This song is so beautiful, one of Demi Lovato&#39;s best

2023 Demi!!!❤❤❤
He made the right choice. If she’s texting other dudes now she’ll be doing more later. Never waste your time on a female that would disrespect you like that. You wanna hook up go ahead but don’t ever marry one like that.

My love of life lovato

Okay so I need a Revamped version of this video, preferably with Jesse ofc but also what it if it was Jutes?

She sings with such a raw emotion,  can&#39;t get enough of her songs 💛💛💛

2023 cuffin season is amongst us ladies. Its time to leave the trash where it belongs

Who TF is Erik?

Lol 😂

True Love 💍 💒 wedding 🤩 song
April looks weird there

I&#39;m never gonna stop gaslighting my brain into shipping them

I love this song!!! It sends a good message.

She&#39;s gorgeous, amazing voice, great actress.
She shows real adults problems

Just noticed that is jackson Avery from greys anatomy

I miss this era, this Demi... in rock, even the instrumentals are louder than Demi's voice, since she wants to sing rock that sounds like Don't Forguet, pop rock, this rock didn't fit, her voice she lost her shine
This girl did this  1 ooowee I can relate ❤😢

Here after rock ver release!!!

Funny that Jackson Avery did the music video with Demi Lovato, and now he&#39;s in the show Only Murders in the Building with Selena Gomez, am I right?

Queen

Louis Willis tell me you love ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕
This lyric is nothing more than an emotional dependence of a person who cannot see themselves without the love of others, they think that life does not exist! That's why you love yourself because when it's over you'll only have yourself.
This song isn&#39;t just for those having bad responsibilities. It relates to those in good relationships that have everyday issues. Pick your truth and stand on it and when you&#39;re wrong don&#39;t be afraid to say I&#39;m sorry and try not to make the same mistakes.

Her.. I&#39;m glad she lost everything.. women.. I told mine.. my heart, til you can put yourself before someone else before yourself..  we can&#39;t have a ring.. she&#39;s kicked me out multiple tomes.. we have 2 babies.. she cheated on me with my cousin.. my mind is gone.. I&#39;m happy around my babies.. but women.. it&#39;s not the guys part all the time.. take responsibility

JACKSON AVERY?

Out of nowhere, Jackson from Grey's Anatomy ❤️😻
I mean do we all see the story line here !!! She wouldn’t give up a “ friend” that lets be real wasnt just a friend for her soon to be husband. He saw through it and left. Shit cut deep

Jesse Williams is so damn sexy! I don’t think they were ever a couple but they look so good together!

Hey does everyone remember when she was hot?? What a shame

ARTE!

I miss you.
This song brings me to tears Everytime

<a href="">2:11</a> <a href="">#ALPHANINER</a>

This is very Jackson Avery behavior 😂😂😂

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - The Toy Store” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ❤️😊

That man is BEAUTIFUL!!!💜🥰😍
Wish I will find true love one day 😢

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it!

We are in this together..I love you 💝

Great song but “you ain’t nobody till you got somebody” that is so sad and so not true and offensive to single people. I still like the song and her voice. You don’t need a relationship to be a somebody

i miss my relationship with her

to think thats jackson from greys anatomy

This is the saddest short film I&#39;ve ever seen. I just stare in awe at her beauty and her voice, god those two are beautiful together.

J/k

Mare wink wink

I really love her but she didn&#39;t love me 😢

<a href="">2:33</a>

Markus 😦
Guys it’s okay. Jackson just left Demi at the altar because April was waiting for him. <a href="">#iykyk</a>

So he&#39;s Jackson in Grey&#39;s Anatomy and she plays a patient in the show too. The celebrity world is small.

Sdds

Story of my life

<a href="">2:33</a>

If everyone was to be rich, no one will be..If everyone stops doing 9 to 5 jobs, our planet will be doomed...Everyone seems to be working mainly for money...If you were to get a lot of money, will you quit your job...Let&#39;s stop chasing money and work for one another...

Let's get married again 😂😂😂Wait a minute someone will get angry
Me and my boyfriend and friends act the beginning part out all the time. My idea in a fight strong words. Came clean. Now it’s for fun

Jackson Avery!!! ❤❤❤ IYKYK
I had no business singing this at 8 years old

tmylm is my 4ever4me 🥹💖

How have I never noticed that this is Jason from GA?!

Really powerful song &amp; video. She did so amazing with this!!!!! She should have gotten more credit for this..

❤❤❤ You&#39;re good
I LOVED U BOTH GOOD LUCK IN LIFE I GIVE UP I CANT LOVE ANYMORE I TRIED I CAN&#39;T SAY GETTING MARRIED WITHOUT STUTTERING SO THATS A PROBLEM FOR ME NOT U CUZ BUT YA IM GONNA HAVE TO PASS ON THE FUTURE I WANT TO B ALONE ITS BEST FOR ME

2023 still going
Every time I see this song, I think of every man who stuck me with him and made me love him. He left me in the middle of the road, not knowing how to go back to the beginning, and not knowing how to continue my life seriously. I hated myself and I hated my marriage because of them.
For thirsty 🍺

Lauren Spencer Smith did it better imo

jackson avery is that youuuuu 😂

Her beautiful voice😢❤
Her beautiful voice😢❤

Uff

Man homeboy is always messing up someone&#39;s wedding hahahaha

I started watching the series recently and I just realized that Jackson was the one in this video jdjdj
They changed the original video when he wafled away from what she did wrong with audio. Don&#39;t get me wrong I love the song but they changed it from her fault to his fault.

&quot;BLOODY WALK AWAY&quot;B4 IT GETS REL BLOODY!

Intro longer than her drug addiction

Demi,     You&#39;re so strong. Stay strong and never forget you have support.

I love this song ❤

I absolutely love this song and both of t hem!! They make such a happy pretty couple!!!&lt;3

Jackson Avery all the time messing up a wedding isn’t he 😂

<a href="">5:41</a> the choir singer looks more distraught than demi lmaoo

<a href="">6:15</a>

Still here loving this in 2023!!!

The best. 🥺

The &quot;she&#39;ll have the large&quot; meme 😅🍟

Why is he always ruining weddings?

How booooring

That's what happens, prikito before the wedding, man got what he wanted, saw that it wasn't all that and jumped out. (IS IT MEME GUYZ, OR NOT) LOL
The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 💕❤

I can’t believe that this song was released 5 years ago. STILL GOLD.

I’m going to leave this comment here and come back within a year to see how many people watch this☺️

I think she was on barney show back in 95 she&#39;s younger

I Love you demi
Beautiful girl how are you

The song is beautiful. However, the line “…you ain’t nobody until you got somebody” is a terrible way of thinking. If this is your philosophy, then you’ve totally misunderstood the point of life. You don’t need anybody to be somebody.

demi knew what tf she was doing when she got jesse williams to be in this mv 😭😭😭😭

I love this song so much.

not jesse williams😨

Not for the sake of
Dewi itu

2023 still rocking❤❤

They had to use &quot;Jackson Avery&quot; who disrupted &#39;April&#39;s wedding ...and all of that

This is one of her best song

Relating 😢
@Love and Peace *Demi L♡v

Demi Lovato I love your music with all of my heart and it is inspiring me

Nostalgia... keep on hitting today.

Beautiful music ❤
Is love real or not to be in a relationshipIf u love someone but I guess they don&#39;t want to be in a relationship

2023 and it is still art ❤
Very good, I hadn't heard it 🫶🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
How it’s possible she has 17 min followers I never ever heard of her??😮😮

Sometimes love is complicated. We have to love ourselves first before we can love and share our lives with others who across our paths.🥹🥹

One of Lovati's best songs, a diva
2023🇰🇪🇰🇪♥️♥️💚💚💛💛
It&#39;s 2023 and I&#39;m here all high on weed vibing to this great tune 👌 🎶

we&#39;re  actually divorced

I was married to my EX BOYFRIEND  florian

It is good humans have friends tho. So that&#39;s a positive

The intro screams narcissim.

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Learning To Love Myself” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you

Alone we are many but than one day perspectives could be alive and only one and we are here
I love demi ❤

Who is still here in 2023 ... still love this song So sad that this masterpice must die ★

Yo, Markus?

I worked on this music video, only guest with a shaved head I believe haha I&#39;m sitting by the aisle in the back. Amazing place deep in the canyons near the ocean. Seemed like something out of a fairy tale, no lie.

Demi is a masterpiece 🙏💖😍

<a href="">6:11</a> was a bit personal for me oo🥺💜♾️✅
The music is so great, thanks for sharing it with us, love you! Wishing everyone a happy working day and luck

Ahhh my uncle slaying as one of the groomsmen

Demi is just so underrated 😪

Let’s talk about Jackson from grey’s Anatomy fineeeeeeeee self ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥and herrr voice ❤❤
I remember

While right tooth canal

He used Facebook

Doctor Rajeev

The dental one

Now the Rajeev Ranjan

And this game is quite old

And quite recently found out evrything in my life was a lie

And reached the place with fabulous goals

Then goal after goal

And then accident

Actually it was your family at the beginning

And then the goverment

Then fight with unknown guys

Opportunity
Things changed

Well if you remember

I would have 2024 was my real relationship timeline until quite recently

I watch this song like a movie every time❤️

This song was made for hailey and Justin

Ugh what happened to her ? She was such a hottie and more now she&#39;s on this whole leftist and liberals b.s. and gender identity nonsense

they should be a couple....cutest babies ever

It’s not true you are somebody without somebody you can’t have the right somebody if your not somebody !❤ if that makes sense

Other than the ring and wedding, this is the current state of my life right now. I had to go dig up this video to cry my eyes out to it😭

holy longest intro ever but love this song

MARRIAGE is FUCKING HARD You never know until you get into it ....It takes a lot of discipline to stay faithful , stay committed

Jackson Avery had a change in career it seems 😊

Jackson Avery left to get April Kepner at her wedding

2023❤❤❤
My wife sent me this song about 2 Yeats ago. Never understood it or wanted to listen as I&#39;m not a fan of this genre but now we are separated but only by homeless situations.  Now I see wtf see was getting at. Maybe soon I&#39;ll be able to love her better! I don&#39;t love myself for things I&#39;ve done so it&#39;s almost impossible to love someone else.........

I&#39;m tired of toxic relationships after this I&#39;m loving myself

What is the name of this movie? Love the song!

Heartfelt video and song by Demi and Jesse

Clearly Demi is Art, this song and they all deserved thousands of awards 🤧❤️
Its 2023 and i just realized thats Avery from Greys

I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE I MARRIED YOUR ASS TCH 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I forget she was an actress before she was a singer. Ugh she’s so good.

Demi is soo talented &lt;3 she isnt like all these artists out here these days who just blow up on the Socials by using that <b>HIPVIEWS dawwwt cawwwwm</b> to get their hits up to go get mad exposure, SMH seem like anyone can go viral these days

Loved this demi

I miss this Demi

Talented, beautiful and yet still troubled. I pray she finds her way.

A beautiful music video. A message that teaches us this: “To love someone, you have to learn to love yourself first in life no matter what.”

Pretty wedding 💕💒 song love song ❣️❣️👗👠👠🍷🕊️
Jackson what you doing here

besides  I&#39;m not ready to get married again  I just got out of a toxic relationship that wasn&#39;t exactly healthy for me most of the guy&#39;s I&#39;ve  dated was very controlling and muuntipulated cheaters

I miss so much for this Demi. I think she&#39;s so lost and can&#39;t find herself.

This is such a bad song. It&#39;s ridiculous and sad to think you are nobody without somebody.  Where is the sense of self worth?

Q will leave you there
Thanks for keeping my daughter clean

This was the last good song she did before she became Satanic! She sold her sole to the devil.

Why I&#39;m here??

i am brutally honest the  last Comment  is Very true

This video has it all, damn it.
My heart would shatter into a million pieces if this was me 😢

This was me then...till I found out all I needed was within me

2023 present!

I&#39;m not ready to get married  not again  not any time soon I just brother out  of  a toxic relationship

God Jackson, I thought we went over this. No more weddings for youuu 😭

2023 &amp; I&#39;m still here

and I&#39;m not ready to get married not again not after being  in a toxic unhealthy relationship

She&#39;s an actress❤️ singer as well!

So no one is going to point out that the actor from Greys Anatomy made this 10X better…

then they turn possive on me

then they cheat on me turns into another toxic relationship

Put your advertising where it fits
Here I’m 5 years later still single 😢

I cannot believe it is 2023 and so many songs have been released yet I still come back to this song

I saw this video before I started watching Grey’s Anatomy so I was like “What”?? Lol when I saw the first episode that we get to meet the character Jackson Avery.

jackson avery daddy

I totally forgot he was in this ❤️‍🔥 <a href="">#greys</a>

Love the song but nobodys talking about JACKSON AVERY ❤😍

the way this didn’t win a grammy is actually mind blowing

2023

Listening to this song after a breakup is a stab in the heart. And to make matters worse (my breakup) was at the beginning of the year, so I'm crying what I didn't cry in 2022. 🫠🥲
I am so relieved that they didn&#39;t get married. That relationship was just a pile of red flags.

Isn’t she a he now? Or did she come back down to reality? I can’t stand this woman.

I got the chills when I heard this song.. it blows mind mind because I can remember my ex saying word for word what he said then the f up thing was I actually got sick of his shit and sick of him treating me like crap and I started like someone named Eric..

He is so f fine... Omg

I was an a toxic relationships that weren&#39;t healthy for me they turned out to be cheaters

Jackson hehe
what an awesome song
I don't want to live, I just want to skimp
Bro&#39;s an android sent by CyberLife 💀

Bae

my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me on New Years Eve and thought of this song to help me process it all.

I love u

Irrelevant thing.. just as those who follow it!..

He's beautiful❤❤❤❤
demi was so beautiful

I love the message they give in this song,  to always be yourself and don’t change for anyone.

Hi a. 🌹💐❤️🌹😍
This video plays out almost all of my past relationships. I love how she is not afraid to address real everyday issues people struggle with

Temazo

Jesse Looks hot as always
Somebody in 2022?

Ideal like relationships are sometimes difficult 🦊😓😨

“You looked at her I watched you” so true

I'm going to tell you about this Jesse Williams, see🥴
You haven’t experienced true emotional and mental eruption until the person you love more than anything gets to a moment of true commitment with you &amp; that’s the first moment they show you they’re not ready for that commitment by walking away from you because it’d be too much to bear staying with you knowing you’re not the one…. Tell me you love me….

Greys anatomy!!

Ich warte i Love you too
Ask me ♥️
She needs a demi sized ration of Bacon 🥓 and eggs in the morning

What is Demi doing with my husband....😂
<a href="">2:34</a>-<a href="">6:47</a>😮😮
Wait… Jackson???? 😱😱
Jackson avery what r u doing here

This song and “Clover Cage - Frozen In Time” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you

Timeless 🥰
Demi already a visionary at her outdoor wedding 😂
Going back to the nostalgia of listening to Demi, now that I noticed that the guy is Avery in grays 😱
Demi Lovato beautiful bride
Is that Jackson Avery??

MARKUS GET BACK TO JERICHO RIGHT NOW
Is that the same guy from Detroit Become Human?

Powerful you love each other that&#39;s awesome keep up the good work you both love each for sure awesome

Today it hit me that this song is about codependent relationship and her journey to let go and depend on herself.... &#39;my heart says, you ain&#39;t nobody till you got somebody&#39;&#39;i don&#39;t know who I&#39;m without you&#39;And the first &#39;everything i need&#39; while looking at him gave me that impression. Then she went on to take off the ring and also say &#39;everything i need is right in front of me&#39;, while looking at herself

I would work my hard ass off to become a singer just to be able to call jessie for video and do THAT. And quit just after.

Tamil lambo is better

Jackson?!?!?! April ain’t gonna like this 🌚

I LOVE YOU

Beautifull history, beautifull show. 🌙🌙🌙🌙
Yes

If you with some one have to go through the Phone hood bye

Dont tell anyone your fasting and don&#39;t have the appearance of fasting. It is some thing between you and God.  🙏

This song makes me cry everytime

I miss Demi Lovato 🥺
I will never let this song die. 🖤

love

You have no trust you got nothing he shouldn&#39;t even proposed if he wasn&#39;t happy in first place

The fact that he’s Avery in greys anatomy!!!

I freaking love this song so much. Those trumpets at the beginning… oh my goodness. I want this to be played at my wedding maybe if that ever happens. My man doesn’t like titles so yeah… a girl can dream though.

Marcus from Detroit become human in real life be like

The intro goes longer than my balls.

Yells in Adam Sandler voice “this is something that could have been brought to my attention YESTERDAY”

Never trusted Bald guys
Remembering my wedding day... Wishing I or my husband walked away at the alter... SMH

Beautiful song
How I used to listen to this on repeat when it came out. Listening this after all these years all I am thinking is how her voice healed me. The impact.

That ring looks a lot like the one Max gave her years later.
I wish I had understood the clip, it was a little blank for me
More than clever this song more from Katy Perry

Am I the only one that has just realised that jackson from greys anatomy 😂

The notifications were turned off on New songs cause your 29 &amp; you want me to tell you I 💘 love you , you know I love you,

Welcome to the generation where no one knows what to do...Marriage is just a concept to everyone in this generation. Lucky to those who find a long life partner...A successful marriage in this era is a blessing

Demi you are unique😍😍😍
Love this song

My heart thrill&#39;s when I hear this song

I do I&#39;m just so fucking sad and disgusted

The video was great. I didn&#39;t especially care for the song.

now that i listen to the music video again, demi&#39;s mom was right, her vocals are stronger than ever

we know

Why is no one talking about how freaking handsome the guy in the video is😭

OK DON&#39;T BE A  JOKER MAN!!!!!!!

To gain eternal life. You must snort ashes. Like the pheonix rising from the ashes. Cremated ashes or tobacco ashes. As long as the ashes once were a life.....

He kinda looks like a fallout ghoul

This is my most favorite song of all time and i freaking love Demi voice here

Man’s Search For Meaning (Summary)

Viktor Frankl



🙏 &quot;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one&#39;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#39;s own way.&quot;  -Viktor Frankl, a Nazi concentration camp survivor



❤ Lesson 1: Being indifferent to death allowed people to survive. 



🙏 Indifference to death, the perspective of merely existing, not living, allowed prisoners to shield their minds from the terrors around them and do what was necessary to survive, grab a vital pair of shoes from a dead body or hide in a pile of manure to avoid being led to the gas chambers.



❤ Lesson 2: Your life has its own meaning and it’s up to you to find it in any given moment.



🙏 Just as there’s no general move in chess that beats all others, there’s no general meaning of life. Your life’s meaning is not only unique to you, it also depends on your decisions and situations. When Frankl was forced to work by the Nazi guards, barefoot, across icy rocks; he imagined his wife&#39;s face up in the clouds; and found bliss in this moment of love.



❤ Lesson 3: Try to force your fears to come true to make them go away.



🙏 To gain a sense of control over our own life we can focus on our internal state of mind, instead of external factors. If you’re afraid of sometimes stuttering in front of your friends, you should do exactly what you’re afraid of. You’ll notice that, as soon as you try to force it to happen, it won’t work, and eventually lose your fear of stuttering in front of your friends altogether.

child of God, you&#39;ll be great...

i just love the romance

The into is no longer my last relationship

Wonderful Demi ❤🇧🇷
What´s the name of this guy/actor again?

This song makes me remember my ex

Sucka Free Balls comedians. The World is not made for you to play with people&#39;s emotions. Get a real fucking job, you know what am saying. People like you suck, playing with emotions sucks, point. You should not even be able to sing this. Sing about oil gas and people dying for no reason, stop being so selfish, it makes me wanna be a baad boy as fuck, cause you aint changing the world, you just making it worst than it is. Am I to geek or to normal for you? IDC, what I know is that this song is worst than me when I seperate with my love. Get up, stand up and stop crying wtf.

It&#39;s 2022 who&#39;s still listening 🎶

EriCK is for NiCK? Was Wilmer jealous of Nick? 🤔🤔🤔

No entendi o clipe Denilovato
I love this song 🤯

It&#39;s all a lie. Love is a lie. No such thing in 2021. I KNOW so many gorgeous women, hot as hell in their prime.....these women SHOULD be having multiple orgasms and honey moons 🌙 with their hubby&#39;s but the hubby&#39;s are fucking like 3 b@%$<a href="">#s</a> so the Queen Empresses are living alone masterbating crying their 30s away or are f@^$@ng women cause they tired of lying cheating dudes. End of a era.  Shivaree is dead. Love? No such thing.

Hey Jesse Williams
It&#39;s from the extended version of The Dark Knight Rises when Bruce and Miranda have a romantic night at Wayne Manor.

DEMI LOVATO WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEE EACH OTHER IF I SHOULD HAVE WENT TO EZEIZA FORGIVE ME I DIDN'T REALIZE OR OUTSIDE THE RECITAL STADIUM I WAITED FOR YOU WHERE I SAID BUT I DIDN'T SEE YOU I HOPE YOU ARE WELL.

/ <a href="">

this keep hitting like one of the best mixes of music and short movie of the YouTube history

I look like you

I love the beautiful my godmom need a heart transformation

Explain what Vilmer did to her when she got older by his standards, I think the song says it doesn&#39;t have to be like that, no, you&#39;re nobody until you find someone and that someone is right in front of You yourself, after the documentary, understand perfectly, 29 also explains a lot!

The intro is beautiful but just imagine if it had come at the end this song is a master piece.

The intro took so long I forgot I was watching a music video…(she starts singing)…”oh shit, yeah that’s what I was doing”

How beautiful it is please!!!!!
<a href="">5:48</a> He&#39;s really used to abandoning the bride in front of the hotel.

My wife told me to watch and listen to this before a fight we got into the very next day I should have listened I&#39;m missing her dearly

I’m not crying, you’re crying
Don&#39;t have to say it but as long as you got my bak

This song and “Clover Cage - Falling For Free” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you..

These terrorists Lukini Shainurovi from Perm Samsonovi Mitini from Moscow Ahmatnurovi Ahmetov from Alicante Zenkovi from Perm Morozovi from Moscow band stole digital copy of my body and my voice for  making easy movies and songs to feed their terrorists group. Never attach their heads to my body. I never gave them any right to use digital copy of my body and my voice for making their movies or music. They are terromrasi and must be in jaiL. I want their brain to be heated in tomography in high voltage before they are gone. I want everyone saw in news how their brain were heated in tomography. Noone must equip  brains  with spy head equipment. I want them to get exradition...

Episode 😩🙏🥰
She was so pretty idk what happen to her

Who&#39;s here in 2022?

Who&#39;s here in 2020

He’s in greys anatomy😍

Darn Jackson, always breaking up with people at the altar or stopping a wedding 🙈

Damn you Jackson for leaving her!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

He left her!!!!

He left to go after April
all i see is jackson from grey&#39;s anatomy now

she did the right thing - amazing place to get married - dream... this marriage would have been a nightmare ... you need to trust and make the other person trust you -- marriage is not a game killing each other... it is the truth loving each other...

I come to this video today cause now my relationship relates to this song. Pretty similar but not get married yet. This song represents me who has trauma of being abandoned, left from the past. because the man told me he is not ready for commitment yet. We kept fighting over small things mostly what I said and we reconciliated and fought again and back and forth just to stay together but actually the man already said that he was not ready from the beginning. The end of the video represented my mind who is not ready now cause i have a trauma, thinking that i will be abandoned and he will leave me but actually I need that man tell me he loves me, yes on days like this, in hardship time.

This men is brahatwait l think

My ex has mentally abused me through the internet. Demi gave me a way out. I sent him this song and blocked him. I’m glad he never met my family.

Love you 😊♾️
2022 and this songs just doesnt get  old

Jesus Christ SavesJesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.Biblical References:1. Romans 5:92. Romans 3:233. Romans 6:234. Romans 10:95. Romans 10:136. Ephesians 2: 8 &amp; 97. John 3:16God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.

HEY BABY LOVE &amp; MISS YOU 😘

Love the song love the video more

I. So glad she received a second chance she&#39;s amazing

I love this song and the video even more. Can we get a second part, please? I am dying to know what happened with these people! hahahhaha

Daniela and Juan Pedro 💅💞💍🌹💗💗🙌
Four years later and I’m just now watching this.

JACKSON LEFT DEMI TO MARRY APRIL KEPNER<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Rf90XtDbG8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Rf90XtDbG8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a>
This song will always be my motivation!
Just a prediction but is this song about herself kinda like self love and this person she’s referring to can be herself

i&#39;m very surprised i&#39;m not seeing any Detroit: become human comments Lmao

This song is a masterpiece! ♥️

I’m sorry but Wilmer had no right romancing a 17 yr old and he’s a grown man . It’s obvious she was still growing hence the not understanding of the Jonas friendship and him being so much older and expecting her to understand experiences you had young that she didn’t go through.

Damn….
Such a powerhouse voice, Demi is so underrated. Love you Dems❤

Jackson Avery ran way  go to marry wiht April............ period

Jesse Williams always hurting women&quot;s heart in music videos haha

She almost sounds black

Demi Lovato is simply a angel 😇 with the voice of many layers and the art of story telling is incredible you can&#39;t help but feel the raw &amp; kinetic energy and the emotions coming out of her voice with each word she sings just warms your heart ❤️❤️ her voice is incredible and we love you Demi stay strong 💯❤️ and can&#39;t wait to hear more from you

Beautiful music
Demi looks beautiful

No one is going to talk about that he&#39;s Jackson from greys anatomy

Demi is so beautiful

This song was so underrated. I don't understand how having the same title as the album didn't have an impact. He deserved more. Demi shines vocally and also actingly. What a pity.
. <a href="">

God help Demi sing this at @LakewoodChurch

This song makes me cry lmao to this day :/

THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG FROM HER

Today I listened to her for the first time.  I dismissed her because of her age. Her voice is timeless. At 68 y.o., I can feel her.

Demi, I adore You so much. 😍❤
I'm going to tell you the truth. I have material hidden everywhere. Little by little the baskets fill up.
Look up the PS4 game Detroit. This man is Markus. He&#39;s an imposter!

Marcus went to simon

Of course, I LOVE YOU!!!!!

Is this Marcus from Detroit become human?

I love it too much, beautiful.

God I miss this Demi 😢

What&#39;s my hand without your heart to hold 😍😍😍😍

It&#39;s better not marrying her than marrying her and got no feelings for her.It hurts a lot.

His eyes are Absolutely Stunning! WOW! &quot; You ain&#39;t nobody till you got somebody? &quot; Are you serious? So not true...

This work is flawless.

Jesse 😍

“You ain’t nobody ‘til you got somebody.”  I hope she is in the process of realizing that she was and is already “somebody,” who is intrinsically significant.  After watching her pre-and post-OD documentaries, it’s heartbreaking to see that her sense of loneliness and emptiness stems from always waiting for others’ love to make her feel whole and worthy.  She has so much heart and love.  I hope she learns to love herself foremost and in the way she deserves to be loved—so that others can love and appreciate her likewise.

If you're not ready to share your life with another person, don't try. Maybe living alone isn't so sad...
the biggest song the biggest clip she has sincerely impeccable
2022 heard this anthem, I love you forever 🇧🇷🖤

The RaptureFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.Deuteronomy 30:19 R.MWOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?

JACKSON AVERYYYY 🥰
Lovato!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
What is the meaning of love in alogos to be Alove only and to make U to be sex object only in bed peaceless (see. Rev 2:12-17, 2:21-22, 17), Hair Peace &amp; Bed Peace To Stop It War Is Over?

 bfbh

Can we all agree that Jackson Avery is known for ruining weddings?

BREAK MY SOUL

Sounds like kiesha cole
JACKSON AVERY !!!

Never get into a relationship if you have insecurities btw no &quot;best friend&quot; should be texting someone&#39;s wife after 12

Back when Demi was a real woman. Sad :(

What if at the wedding the woman had to wait for the groom??? To me it would make more sense....
Actually this happen in. Her real life

Ms. Lovato. I&#39;m going off the deep end. I am the oldest evil in existence.
