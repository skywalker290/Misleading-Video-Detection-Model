I have something to say, which i have been keeping for a very long period, in october 2022, somehow i got an indication of a death, the day was the 5th day of durga puja, that night one of my family members came to the house, and completed dinner sitting right to me, next day he made a road accident and got dead, when i reached the MORTUARY for post mortem procedure, a dead body of a member of IAF came to the place on an auto, but few minutes later 15-16 TOYOTA vehicle came to the place, i had two things in my mind, either toyota will be responsible for my dead body, or toyota will save me from any accident, hence thanks to the lord shiv and maa durga for my unemployment, other wise on 24,10,2022 (DIWALI) my dead body could have reached the NORTH BENGAL MEDICAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL for post mortem, today 27.2.2024, and i am still unemployed, and i do not have any orders to buy any TOYOTA VEHICLE in future for driving, hence almighty has decided to make me sit in innova of NHAI, and after innova or land cruiser as the most POWER FULL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OF INDIA, still i got order to buy LAND ROVER DISCOVERY SPORT, VOLVO XC 90, AUDI Q3, followed by BMW XM, G 63, for driving, orders may vary may not be vary, thank for reading my comment,,

And that's how you do good advertising 
bmw is the german dodge

Now do it again with some cars that aren&#39;t ugly. Granted they&#39;re still better looking than the new M2, 3 and 4 series. Don&#39;t mess it up with the new M5, but we all know you will.

2 series is 9 years old??

@Bmw rock and roll ️

Corporate tyranny RULES the world, even Europe. BMW proves this and it is a CRIME that they are still in bidness. Talk about transference of wealth from owners to parts manufacturers and BMW dealer service departments. It is ALL SO OBVIOUS, but American owners, like ALL BMW owners, have ZERO representation in CONGRESS or in the average American courtroom, save for those who are in the top 1% wealthiest. So as the buyer, you are supposed to KNOW that buying a BMW INCLUDES several thousands more for constant repairs. So buyer beware, because BMW has absolutely NO LEGAL DUTY to make ANYTHING of good quality and reliability. This is because wherever you are in this f-d up world, WHOMEVER HAS THE MOST MONEY rules the courts and owns the judges. That is NOT YOU. That is OLIVER ZIPSHITZ, the current BMW CEO. How evil and morally bankrupt must you be to get THAT job?

This video is really fire 

This is what BMW is, sadly not what it is today

Bimmer Society on top!

I&#39;m not a BMW fanboy, but this is the greatest car commercial ever made

Ah yes… South AfricaA.K.A The BMW Fan club

Very nice 7yrs old and design still looks nice 

Drift mode -- unlocked by your BMW battle pass -- drive it on enough toll roads to unlock -- the future is now!

How do I contact bmw headquarters in Germany? I am from UK and own a bmw. I have contacted BMW UK a number of times. They are not responding back or helping me at all. Someone advise?

Is it just a movie or is BMW really doing this? I'm going out to see if this is real. Laughter.
Top car

What is the movie

Nnn

A project that suits BMW
eBay:our cars are better than bmw.Bmw:do what we’re doing on our video.eBay:try’s to do that but instead eBay car explodes.Bmw:who said eBay is better.eBay:I take back now

This is frickin awesome

Well, I see we have mind readers over there. Nice to see One&#39;s imagination on display.

A BMW that doesn&#39;t drift is a pointless object!

Really Excellent Drift show. Well done to all drivers. Congratulations. I may call You As The Stars Of BMW. Thank You very much.

Superrrrrrr drifting loved it

Okay fast and furious/ tokyo drift wya

I’m still confused how society has convinced us that everyone should drive with the same speed on roads. Obviously some can drive better than others. I can’t but still...

wowww

My all time favourite video

My BMW is an e46 ///M 2

The only company that goes as far to not even warn the customers to drift like that. DOPE

In 2023?I wouldn&#39;t surprice if they are in the Fast and Furious

Rip tyres

I miss those demonic lights..

Bmw king 
We need to go and rob a bank 

You can actually see the power of the engine.

And not one of them used their indicators. How typical.

This kind of drift is kind like fast drift

Always 1st Love but Couldn&#39;t afford..

It still amaze me until today.

<a href="">1:45</a> Favourite Part

cgi?

That is a epic stunt

OG ads, now bmw is like “make earth cool again” in their ads 

Then just for fun, see the same cars going out of control at the Nurburgring.

epic epic epic

what a well proportioned grille!

I believed that was in Spain. Idk why but the bitumen gonna be heavy after this

Today it would has to be an electric

More cuts than a batman fight scene.

I WANT THIS CAR

This advertisement enough for BMW...

FAX - BMW (BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS)

That’s how I ride to work everyday. The police somehow do not like it. But who are they I to argue with bmw owner’s manual.

<a href="">#BMWstories</a> why bmw dont use  turn signals ??

Imagine someone calling the cops on them

Epic

Why is this in my recommended 6 years later ?

That is awesome! Amazing driving!

Top performance, and in Germany you would go to jail as a private person for it!
I kinda want one now...
Define BMW in one word: Masters!

Now imagine someone pointing a laser pointer in one of the drivers eyes

Ugly model

On our ring they do the same thing every day, and on gigs
Unfortunately it doesn’t look so clever when their buyers try to imitate the bad boy/street race/drift image that BMW has been subliminally pushing for the 3 and 4 series for a while

simple superb extraordinary. Excellent communication well balanced drifting. Hatsoff to all the one who drove the car Mindblowing. Great job guys 

All is great, but now is again tike to come up next generation of front design.

Hi BMW! I really need help. My dealer in Russia stole my darkened mirror. And he doesn&#39;t want to give it back to me. The service gave me the usual one. Support for BMW Russia does not want to solve this issue. Please find out the truth. I can send you the vehicle&#39;s VIN code to check the configuration.

So very skilful
GOOD 
The only thing more beautiful than those cars is the city it was filmed in...... 10/10 CAPE TOWN

BMW car quality surprisingly sucks !The BMW dealer (stevens creek) is selling you defective car with brand new price !!!I purchased a brand new 2020 X7 from this dealer.And the car was broken after 7 days driving:1. The touch screen is 100% off, I can not control anything on the display.2. The bluetooth wipe out my and my wife&#39;s phone (Andriod and Iphone both) connection 3 time a week, which mean we need to reconnect/reconfigure our phone connection every other day.3. The battery is dead permanently, the error signal was on when I purchased it originally, but the sales told me it will be back to normal after couple days driving. But after 1 week driving, the battery error signal is still there, and need to be replaced.4. The rubber seal on the frontend hook is coming out, and looks really ugly and do not match the BMW brand at all.5. The auto lock is not function at all. After enabling this feature, the auto lock still not working at all. This feature is very normal one on any premium brand car back to 5+ year ago.  I personally own another Acura and Tesla, all of cars have this function and there is no problems to use such function in the past 3 years.6. All of the cellphone app remote control function is not working on my car. I can not lock/unlock/flash/horn the car via the phone app.I drop off the car 5 calendar days (4 business) ago.And service department is still working on it, from the time it took, I can definitely tell this is not a small issue. Since the service adviser told me, replacing a new battery will only cost them half business day.So for sure, there is a huge defective on this brand new X7 car.I am really surprised that this dealer will sell defective car to the customer, especially on such high end/premium 7 series product line.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update @2020-06-24:After 5 days waiting, today afternoon the service department just called me back, saying the display is totally off, and can not be fixed by them. So they decided to order a new display from BMW, and the new part will arrive on Friday(so another 3 business days waiting). And then they will need to replace the display part completely!Can you imagine this is what happened to a brand NEW X7, with 7 days driving and only less than 200 mileage.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------update @2020-07-16After 3 weeks of review, the BMW North America customer relationship department called me and said they made a decision and will do nothing regarding my defective X7. I feel speechless and helpless. BMW is acting like a robber, who steals your $, with a defective product, and does nothing about the complaint. I do not see how BMW is caring about its customer. Really disappointment, and I will seek to sue BMW North America.

I want to see this done on the asphalt here in Goiânia. Hahahaha

BMWdream🇮🇳
My story ? Had a e92 335i bi turbo from  40k miles on the clock for 6 years. First common fault water pump next common issue fuel pump, injectors, turbos, electronic sensors like oxygen, vanos, abs and many more. Oil leaks from everywhere. Whole Suspension has to be replaced before 100k miles. Non stop cracked 19” alloys. Oil consumption after oil leaks fixed 1L every 800 miles. Finally engine died at 120k miles, coz of water pump fault again.

Great but in town they rarely exceeded 30 km/h.
Acting like Turkish Stars 
Why you no leave the Cape Town license plates on the cars ? 

Yeah! This ad makes you think!
My bmx can drift too and doesn&#39;t have oil leaks so I prefer my bmx xd

Coooolll

Well this is were clouds come from kids

Cant wait for the new version of this drift video in the new m135i and new m235i. Oh wait, you make fwd trash now so you cant.

That moment when you realise you can no longer do that with a small BMW...This brand really needs to fire a few people

typical km 0

BMW AUDI MERCEDES and Dodge have the best marketing teams

You can quite easily see that a lot of the footage is fake or fast forwarded, but i enjoyed it nonetheless

Ah the M2s or the bitchy M4s I like to call them

Funny how the car sounds completely different on the inside....its almost like they play fake engine sounds through speakers inside haha but thats silly....right?

<a href="">0:07</a> Fiesta driver’s hate this trick

The good old tiemes when the grills looked good

This is how Marketing has to look like

Imagine being late to work and then they put up a roadblock to make you even later just so they can show drifting bmw’s.

I love bmw

This is how you do it top gear.

Send this to Nissan)

BMW

Me: I need a car that I can drift. Got some, Audi?Audi: No, but you can go to the BMW dealership next store.

Hey BMW I want to buy a new 235 to do this.BMW: I&#39;m so sorry you never could do this anymore at because our 2 series become front wheel Drive we suggest you to buy a second-hand BMW and or get the 3 or 4 series but they are more heavily and more expensive and a softer suspension make you feel more luxurious...............That is not I want

Installation. In 2 minutes not a single one broke.
Only BMW would do this

I&#39;ve seen this many times...In my city...Bmw e46...At 3am.

Bmw: posts impressive drift videos of their rear wheel drive carsALSO BMW: lets make a 2 liter front wheel drive car and call it the new 135 iI like what i see but not what I am going to see with the next 2 series

Car manufacturer: we created the best system so our cars can be stable BMW: Hold my bear

Factory drift train haha whoop whoop Beemer ftw

BMW is the best car company ever!

Boooo! (Boo)
Awesome drift s

I can imaging how many cars been crashed to rec this show. Cool stuff guys.

Cape Town South Africa

Ha

100% percent adv, few camera angles are trick shoot and especially the drone shoot is 1.5x speed editing. Most of the shoot is cut and play then edited as if single shot video. However I like the video.

Oh god... perfect drit...️
I think the one driving the bmws is ken block and his fansCause there pure legends in drifting

Welcome to the special effects

That&#39;s what the people like...

I love BMW

But Audis are better at understeer.

And then the engine lights came on.

We are introducing a new concept, synchronized drift))) Looks epic)))
Well I am impressed by the skills of the drivers ...You are invited for the world&#39;s greatest race <a href="">

<a href="">#BMWstories</a> want one, but can&#39;t afford it... thats my story.

Its 2019, youtube? Why a 5 year old commercial?

Do this and you will be fined 5 thousand TL per car in Turkey 
they all are professional driver

Sometimes all you want to be is a confused looking &quot;non-paid-actor&quot; holding a phone camera at something

I Love BMW

Bmw great car to fire...

The trick is serious, but the BMW is a beauty. 
Then it catches fire
BMWMERCEDES-BENZ

Hey can anyone say me..? What model or series in this video of BMW.!

I have a dream to own this car some day

I can smell those rubber

The M235I was one of my dream cars

EUROBEAT INTENSIFIES

The best BMW commercial I hv seen.  Almost every 235i is sharp n edge beyond.  The race is great with BMW sponsorshowcasing

beha power
You are not Japanese to do this kind of crap, and try to push it like this on a BMW Mercedes and other European crap, the Dzhekichan with all the sensors will light up and the engine will crank the liners or something else... and you're a guy for at least a hundred))) Besides, drift without LSD blocked is not drift....the cars were prepared for this show.(
My BMW story is: I can&#39;t even afford one. 

Not bad

&quot;Mercedes Benz viewers also watched this channel&quot;...And laugh their butts of.

Sinn ؟

how to drive like an asshole instruction video by bmw

FUCK&#39;IN AHEM.... SPEECHLESS!

Wow 
<b>pretty much how the average BMW driver drives anyways, except not in a safe condition and no skills</b>Audi drivers these days trying to copy the aggressive and egoistic attitudes (or aka asshole attitudes), I would say they are catching up to top dick drivers rankings right next to BMW pretty quickly. They are still missing the reflective sun glasses though.

Super

How can I find the background music you used in the background ..thanks ...........The hinter dem Plan Fonds you used .THANK Wie kann ich die Musik finden Sie
For those asking who actually buys a BMW, and drifts with it... I do. As my weekender (fun car), I have drifted complete turns, and intersections on the road in California... I like the adrenaline rush I get ;) . Do not try it if you don&#39;t know what you are doing. You can cause a serious accident if you mess up. Practice on an open parking lot secluded from populated areas, or at a race track. I drive a tastefully modded E36, and have taken it over 155MPH in a matter of seconds, while the inline 6 cylinder engine roars!. This car has a lot of character, considering the style of contours, and the racing history this model has, to the engineering that went in to it. The E36 saloon, or coupe corners like a pro, and has a 50/50 front to back weight ratio. The chassis was tested on a highly advanced machine that simulated the Nurburgring race track from Germany, to configure a well balanced suspension that provides that ultimate driving experience. This BMW gets complements everywhere I go with it, and it deserves to be well taken care of for sure. If you want to play with BMW&#39;s always buy genuine parts, or better ones. If not you will learn the hard way. Like any nice car, its more expensive to maintain than to own... specially after the warranty period.

Go go! Bavarian Murder Weapon

great, GREAT!!!
WHATS THE SONG AT THE END THE BEAT

It's impossible not to write a comment :Dfenaa
Awesome !!

Message to the editor of the vid if i was you i would have put beethovens 5th in the background

<a href="">#squadgoals</a>

Far out. This was too shaky and all the scenes were too short and cut together for me to enjoy. It just looks like a compilation of little bits where they didn&#39;t screw up. =-/

Meh Lamborghini Drifts i wanna see
Super reversals. shine
I really wish I could do that :)
Awesome

Amazing drifts!
Mercedes benz sls amg blacks:)

BMWs are the BEST!!!
I wish I was one of the drivers.

Jest moooooc! !!!!

I wonder which one Frog is driving :P
The year is 2025 and BMW only makes front wheel drive crossovers :/lol jk but my worst fear is not being able to buy something rear wheel drive that can drift and has a manual transmission when I (hopefully) get a well paying job myselfIt seems like most car companies are switching over to big sedans or crossovers and ditching manuals

My story is that my X5 has a frikin automatic and can&#39;t do shit about it :(

Luke Huxam is a mastermind when it comes to shooting car videos. Awesome as always, and thanks to BMW for making it happen!

Must be like this
BMW sales rep car go away BMW your hopeless, everything about BMW is naff especially the M cars utter crap and embarrasing who cant laugh at a BMW especially an M car junk is polite

738 Audi drivers were here.
bimmers click here to subscribe

Everything
Damn I wish they could do a real one, some parts were real but most of it were editing.

I wish we can do like this in Japan

That was one of the worst videos I&#39;ve ever seen....I think I felt sick watching it.  Cheese anyone?

how many bmws did you go through

Relax, men. Our Russian cars can drift more good)

Forza Horizon 2 Virtual DriftMob by DomesticMango
Awesome choreography drift these lads at BMW did.

Quick question: how much does it cost?
Some the clips look suspect. Kinda resembles CGI, but it could well be sped up a little.. Too hard to tell

Lets see Audi-boys do that!

Add on instagram- BMW_UDM 

It&#39;s not fake TheZakon I was there on set... it took them hours to get it together! with a lot of almost boring cuts and retakes!

Awesome

I&#39;d like to say I drive just as well, but alas, I cannot.  But I still can get around corners quickly!

You are the best
delnova :Djgfsadlk
It&#39;s not fake, just sped up a little.

my BMW story is at most in 1/72 :S

Splendid...

E.P.I.C

Super :)
So much irony.. USA police close off the circle, eurpean license plates on the cars, video recorded 20meters from my work IN SOUTH AFRICA.

Excellent..
God, thank you that you have created Germany which in turn created a BMW &lt;3

I want this car.. :)

Totally fake lol, but it looks nice! 

hahaha nice
This is epic and even cooler that it&#39;s in Cape Town!!

It looks almost fake because of the amount of times the scene was cut and shot a different angle. I want to see a raw video where it isn&#39;t cut every five seconds, or at least show the scene when they drift and once they&#39;re done drifting play it back again in a different angle. But whatever that was must of been amazing to watch in person.

Wow, very cool!
It's not bad, but let's not pee ;)
The future of BMW is more brighter than yesterday. Salute

This is BMWs idea of RESPONSIBILITY?! No wonder it has not had the responsibility to recall cars affected by  timing chain faults. Thousands and thousands of claims against this puffed up company. BMW is living ON  a hard earned reputation but not UP to it, according to people who know much better than me

If you want to see BMW Drift Videos Then you Have to visit my channel Which Include more than 100 video For BMW Cars Drift Burnout Flames Crashes Supercharged Turbo Tuning And More ..So what are waiting For !!

Sexy ass video 

BWM you don&#39;t have to warn me not to try this on public roads.....OFF COURSE I will not try this!  But Thanks :)

What  is this 

WOW ! Wery cool
That is what I mean while talking about art. Those BMWs are perfect for good drifting.

swelling with BMW pride!

Rear Wheel Drive FOR EVER!!!

( fuck bmw ) Mercedes-Benz &lt;3 &lt;3
so much of this is so fakke

seen better at the local show

What&#39;s the music at the last part?

Fabulous

I would be interested to know if and how many BMWs were wrecked during the training :D
I have an ActiveHybrid 7, that`s been in service for 7 moths now.Engine changed, electric engine changed + 100 other parts that i don`t even remember!!Now my car is in Munich Germany and they still cannot fix it!Do not Buy over glorified BMW SHIT BOX! Respect yoursef!

I love BMW cars! The video really amazed me, especially the professionals driving it, but it seems to me that without special editing and good camera angles it would not have been so impressive.
who was the cameraman?

Dammmmmn!!!!

If I only had the money...

This one time, I was doing doughnuts round a round about, and this cop came, and I asked her to get in, and she arrested me instead.

I have officially started saving!!

To mutch edit looks fake sometimes, nice car though

I love BMW!
