Natural beauty is more beauty than plastic surgery

Natural looks are best !

We men are more natural and beautiful than woman

Good beby love you

Shilpa shetty ...natural beauty real beauty

Anushka looked good why did she do plastic surgery

I&#39;ve seen some Bollywood actress would spemd lootta tym in skin cosmetics and skin treatment just stay young or blah bt does not workout or exercise which makes u look more Young and fit. They are lazy to follow natural and easy steps than idly spending money on unnecessary products n spoil themselves . Lol

Why always their lips. Xd

If you have money, do something
Plastic surgery is not necessary, we need blood because some actresses spoil their face in order to look more beautiful….so they should not do that….take the example of Ab Mouni for her surgery. Achi hai hai .Whose bo or jaadi beautiful or popular bhi ho gayi ..,..but those whose face is already perfect should not do all this.
Natural beauty is perfect

What should I do?
Fake beauty real appreciate 

Who cares what we say?
It is necessary to do nose surgery..
Make up isn&#39;t beauty..u guys fool people around by artificial appearance..do not entertain our generation calling it beauty..

It&#39;s good for them who feel comfortable and impowerd after sugery  we shouldn&#39;t criticise

No

Rekha and shilpa shetty is missing in list

You become tight after surgery but how can you make your body tight if you wear the same size as before?
Bad with plastic surgery is Priyanka

But Rani Sonali some heroines are true beauty

Humans should remain natural.
Ehat about karina kapoor

What is the need of plastic surgery and it is necessary to do it but in the log itne khoobsurat hote huye they do it like this…but the real need of them is at the time when they have to do surgery for example what kind of face is done to someone's face? ki zarut hai but log q karte h j don't know like surgery bekar chiz h kisi ko toh karna tohhi chaiye.....but I'm very sad about Sana Makbul......inko jabardasti karvanii padii surgery ..........

Dear God in heaven, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I acknowledge to You that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the life that I have lived; I need your forgiveness.I believe that your only begotten Son Jesus Christ shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn from my sin.You said in the bible that if we confess the Lord our God and believe in our hearts that God raised Jesus from the dead, we shall be saved.Right now I confess Jesus as my Lord. With my heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. This very moment I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to His Word, right now I am saved. Amen.

The Gospel of salvation of our souls: For what I received I passed on to you as of [first importance]: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.  After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time,

Ghutiya

Plastic surgery should not be done to the star at all
The government is wasting a lot of plastic and creating waste.
No, in my opinion, plastic surgery is not right at all because nature should use whatever it has made, it should remain as it is, this is how it happens if you go against nature.
No

<a href="">8:55</a> Bilkul nahi ... Naturally beauty is real beauty 

No

Nhi

May be everyone is beautiful

We desi people always put the whole towel inside our nose  to clean it up. No wonder why our nose keeps getting bigger and broader. Always use the pressing motion when cleaning nose; never insert finger or things cuz it will stretch your nose from inside. 

&quot;...apni jaal mein phasa diya hai.&quot; LMAO. It&#39;s plastic surgery; a product/service not some mouse-trap. haha.

If anyone is real beautiful, so no need plastic surgery

I hate people who change themselves just because someone else call them &quot;ugly&quot;. Didn&#39;t Priyanka said &quot;be yourself&#39;&#39;, wtf happened now?

Absolutely not
What is the secret of Rekha's beauty???

No

Natural  beauty  is best  rather than any kind of surgery

no noone should go for cosmetic surjery should stay original

Wao rakhi is a celebretery

Old sridevi is nice

All are ugly

As you age, your body changes and you have to accept it. You will change the upper body but how will the internal changes change? As the body gets destroyed with age, it is better to have it as it is, just maintain it well and the rest of the upper body is important. Original is better than artificial.
Karishma Kapoor surgery se pehli hi jayada sunder thi...

Plastic surgery should not be done, God has given a name to a person, it is very good, if he changes anything, he looks very ugly.

Natural beauty matters

Ayesha takes looked too horrible after surgery

but most of them ruined their face like recently i watched dil bole hadipa and rakhi was looking very gorgeous and now she looks like ghost. Similar is the case with ayesha takia and sri devi. Anushka also looked so bad in KWK but then she enhanced her surgery

Sridevi rounded face turn into long sock karishma also anuska is beautiful before surgery looks sruti Hassan but after surgery her cuteness loss.

Our own skin is the best skin then the plastic surgery

<a href="">

<a href="">

<a href="">

you should never do this because your face is different is God&#39;s blessing and creation....

Ya thatvgood you want to improve your face but natura is natural  that my opinion that your life whatever you want to do in your face that not our problem

Anushka before the plastic surgery Was cuter than now

Nothing
By doing plastic, the whole look should be changed so that the whole look is innocent and the natural look will be changed and the actors themselves should think that if the look is natural or artificial, then it seems that I have seen it. I am suffering so much...

Oee pagal hema malini became old that&#39;s why her face became like this

No there is no need to do that, I am happy with his acting.
I don't want it
Allah has created us the way he has created us, so it is a crime to separate from the natural things.
I think every one has right to b beautiful by their own way of perception they have right to b wtever they want to (as long it doesn&#39;t harm others)but in my personal opinion they were also very beautiful even before the surgery and had a natural glory which I like very much in every thing every living being ️

the sad part is none of them needed any work.

All plastic dolls nothing is real ..they look awful...

I hate Rakhi Sawant
Nhi krni chy srgry

Obviously actors should cry, but normal people should also cry if there is something wrong with their face or they are not happy with it, then they should do whatever makes them beautiful or happy.
Natural beauty is always best

No

wish
No

Not good

Surgery is not good Natural beauty is the best

It&#39;s their body their choice

The only people needed plastic surgery in bollywood ever was Sridevi and Shilpa Shetty. Bcoz their nose shape wasn&#39;t as per &quot;beauty&quot; standards. and it turned out dramatically well for them. It enhanced their beauty. for rest it&#39;s dysmorphophobia. a mental disorder which is constant need to look flawless. Plastic surgery has only temporary <a href="">effects.as</a> u get old it will disfigure ur face as it&#39;s unnatural and dosen&#39;t cope with ur body. Look how Katrina Kaif looking now. but it&#39;s root cause is constant pressure by &quot;Men&#39;s beauty standards for women&quot; in glamour industry as thers very low number of women who got control. these poor women are victims and puppets of their system. I seriously think if women controls and get all the power to beauty standards, there will be a much lower pressure on women and normal for us

Everything seems to be baking
Goddess of plastic surgery devi mouni roy 

<a href="">3:14</a>

Netural look is better and beutiful ... No surgery

I think there isn&#39;t anything wrong with getting plastic surgery when it can either actually make you more beautiful or you really need to get one done....But for people who are already beautiful they should think a 100 times before they go ahead and ruin their faces...then again there is nothing wrong with mild adjustments which would not have much side effects but going for repeated surgeries is only going to lead to health hazards and not beauty...by the way I don&#39;t know if others feel the same but Priyanka Chopra&#39;s nose after surgery kind of looks like voldemort&#39;s nose from Harry Potter 

Natural beauty is real beauty

Everyone who is reading this comment I want your opinion that  if you are going out with some guy but later he tells you himself that he has done nose job as he was always insecure about it will you still go out with him or judge him based on his previous looks and 2 ques that if you have gone through for any sort of plastic surgery shoud you tell your partner like for ex I got nose job done I met some guy two three later and we started going out should I tell him about my surgery or not

If someone's face has been damaged in an accident, then there is no benefit in doing plastic surgery, but if it is not stupidity to do plastic surgery on a good face, then what else is there. You will get nothing except regrets. By doing this, people are appealing to nature.

How much change has taken place in the face with WQT? It is necessary to undergo surgery....
Lmao... In india you have to get a plastic surgery for being an actor because your talent is not needed in the movies, just some dancing and looks would be all. The great actors who don&#39;t look very attractive are not appreciated here! Producers, directors or even some audience just wants to see some pretty faces not actors.

Natural beauty always appreciable

Have you forgotten Shilpa Shetty?
Still looks like plastic

Wise people are those who feel safe when they see someone else hitting them. When someone has spoiled his appearance by doing plastic surgery, he must take care of it. Jesus has created us very beautifully and this is the result of trying to understand him.
No plastic surgery should be done, it looks good the way it is because if it is not good then how will it happen.

Natural looks are always good, dont do experiments with ur natural looks even daily makeup with lots of cosmetics is also very harmful. Try to stay natural, if u want to change anything that makes u look most beautiful then make ur inner beauty more beautiful

be natural enjoy and accept natural looks  some of them look horrible(chhudail) after plastic surgery I still fail to understand how priyanka Chopra got that tittle, kuchh toh jhol hai.
