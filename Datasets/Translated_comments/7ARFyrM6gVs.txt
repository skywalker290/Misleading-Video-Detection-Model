EXCELENTE FANTASÍA;SI NO HUBIERAN SURGIDO LOS OTROS DOS AUTOS ROJOS EN EL PUENTE.. ¿QUÉ?VALDRÍA MADRE TODO NO?!

This is the moment I knew I had to have a WRX

<a href="">2:25</a> I like the detail that you can see him put it in reverse

Imagine giving him the car with a f1  engine.

<a href="">0:18</a>

<a href="">0:06</a>

<a href="">0:08</a>

<a href="">4:38</a>how stupid are youcops: yes

heck of a opening scene.

I wonder how many fingerprints he left on that door banging to the music

god damn I love my WRX

algumas cenas são como um velocista

The greatest 6 minutes in the history of movie car chases, no question. Wright couldn&#39;t have gotten the scene any better in his wildest dreams.

ele conduz bem o carro.

I would be throwing up

SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~SUBARU~

Imagine Baby Driver in fast &amp; furious.

Mitsubishi evo can be mutch betetr, but  who cares :)

That&#39;s like me in my WRX hahahaha. I&#39;m just not THAT amazing of a driver =P

⚰️👻☠️☠️👻👻👻☠️

how can subaru do drifting if all their car is AWD

This first 6 minutes clip of the movie has more car race scene than fast &amp; furious saga

Man I just wish people would realize Edgar Wright makes awesome movies when they are released, seemsLike people find his movies after they have comeOut

Dumbest Movie

they money the got from the robbery they would have spent on the next fast getaway car...

One of the last creative movies before we went into the Garbage movies of the 2020s

Dude pointed forward and got the opossite direction🤣🤣🤣

<a href="">1:00</a>

This could be a short film if it wanted to be

Drivers from delhi and mumbai be like:

one of the greatets opening scens ever made.

I love how they understand how Baby sincronize everything with music

When you reach that right level of stoned when playing GTA

all that work just to put fingertips on the doors as they exit to the new car. SMH

Damn! That rear trunk/boot was so heavy that it required two big guys and a hot chick to open...😂

<a href="">2:35</a> i love this

if you pay attention, everything is synced, from the camera switches, to the trunk opening, and even down to police sirens its a very well orchestrated movie

Как фильм называется?

If you ever get the chance to see Jon Spencer live don&#39;t miss it!  He puts on a great show , every time 🎸

<a href="">3:05</a> The pillars on the divider are synced with the snare hits in the song! There are so many tiny details like this in the film it&#39;s insane

Drive did it better.

Dogshit chase scene

Love the movie \❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

the way jon bernthal looks at him when he goes in reverse lmfao

Hugely overrated movie. Driver was better

Allpro Subaru in Alpharetta , Ga. Did the tuning of the red subi. And that of two camera cars for this shoot. Rated at 700 whp each. If you have a subi in ga. They are the shop.

huh

it is fully бред

We love you!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

<a href="">3:47</a>You know, I usually don&#39;t see goofs but that one I saw.

Fingle Dan looks different

Great driving scene.  I heard they won an award in this scene for the WORST background music in 2017, it was a Razzie award I believe (if not, they should have).  Dorky song.

all that racing going flat out to the limits then pulling into the car park and switching the engine of lol thats the turbo knackered lol

my when I play Mario kart

I was on an airplane and clicked on the new spiderman movie. I only realised about 4 minutes in that this was not spiderman lol.

Was he slow? No

honestly, what&#39;s more impressive is that Baby did it in a subaru...without it breaking down

Red...... inconspicuous.....

<a href="">3:10</a> my grandma drives faster than that.

I&#39;ve got this on blu ray one of my favourite movies the soundtrack is brilliant

my only issue with this scene is that when he floors the throttle at <a href="">2:32</a> the engine just does another tiny rev and doesn&#39;t immediately start bouncing off the limiter

<a href="">2:51</a> - <a href="">3:20</a>My favorite part of the chase. That part is just PERFECTION

Baby is just a baby compared to the guy who DRIVES.

Driver don&#39;t use glove, and they don&#39;t burn the Subaru... Cops have just to take fingerprints of everyone...How the producer can miss this !

Damn the driver’s lips are beauitful!

Great music, great action, great editing. But had he just driven away normally and calm, no police would have gone after them because police hadn&#39;t responded to the robbery yet. But then we would not have an action film.

Great driving scene and an incredible soundtrack.

CGI car stunts are a turn off for car enthusiast. I prefer &#39;The Driver&#39;.

If you told me Edgar Wright made AMVs or frag highlight vids in his spare time, I&#39;d believe you. The way the music syncs to the smallest things just reminds me of the most well done ones.

Nah when you can see the road in his glasses that was so dope

NFS :  Most Wanted

I love the fact that he checked out the drivers in red cars around him and chose the one that would act just as planned

It kind of hits different Kevin Spacey saying, &quot;That&#39;s my baby.&quot;

The editing in this scene is INSANE.

belbotooooommssss

The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion! ❤

one of my favoirte movies and one of my favorite scenes

Mékanikool!

shout out to the impreza&#39;s head gasket, it must have been hard finding one that lasted the entire scene

Fun fact: no seatbelts were harmed during the filming of this scene

Dad !!! i wanna drive like this guy

That&#39;s my babe

GTA 6 being real af nowdays

he&#39;s good

Prints all over the Subaru on leaving it!

Door is open watch

god i love that the getaway car is a hawkeye subie makes an already perfect opening that much better

Imagine doing this with a automatic shift car

Is he acoustic?

i aint got the blues no more i said

Heh, he waited until the other three were in the bank before geeking out.

<a href="">2:35</a> guy points forwardbaby drives backwardsguy looks at him like &quot;you fookin kiddin me&quot;

BEAUTIFUL!! One of the best movie scenes I&#39;ve ever seen

baby driver is such a underrated movie

Worst getaway driver ever - just made it obvious to the passing cop they&#39;re the suspects! And left all the forensic evidence in the car.... and it&#39;s bright red... I&#39;m getting the idea of this film now.

most impossible car chase ever lol

Ok so is this whole movie just entirely based on the Mint Royale Blue Song? Cause if so they cast the wrong driver. Even the damn windshield wiper thing

Mint Royale - Blue Song

Movie name?

I forgot just how good this was.

--- 4237 children, 2719 women and 631 elderly people killed by the Israeli army..2023

Ese dia punisher uso pañales

Punisher is doing side quests

Rewatching this movie and appreciating the amount of effort put into it such as the driving aspect, the music syncing the music to the beats of everything else and the storyline is outstanding. Wish they made a second one.

I hate this scene so much. All of the cool stuff he does to get out of situations is just edited out &quot;ohhhhh! watch out he&#39;s about to -&quot; quick cut and he keeps driving

can&#39;t imagine how many gaskets that Subaru blew up for this scene

<b>Blows head gasket</b>

Smooth 😜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️

Freakin love EW movies.

I&#39;ve tried this in GTA but failed.

Great mobie but is basically a rip off of drive

Did they actually hire him?

<a href="">3:58</a> nah this didn&#39;t have to be this perfect it&#39;s so cool

Sigh, of course they should have shut the doors.  Just sigh.  So close to perfect.

I like how they just leave all the doors open on the Subaru.

was he slow?

<a href="">3:08</a> yea .. I take back everything I said bout you..

Statham has done better in Transporter.

Did the chase scene make any sense, or felt even slightly realistic?---- Hell NO!Did it make the movie fun, and got people exited! YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!

Spacey&#39;s character was a horrible creep but now that line at the end sounds extra rough.

Excellent choice of getaway car; a 300HP &amp; 300 Lb-Ft torque symmetrical AWD 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX STi that anyone can actually buy for about $15K in good shape and can reach 60 mph in 5 seconds!

Perfection.

this made me want a wrx

Good lord, how many fingerprints and DNA do you want to leave on the car?

i love Subaru

no gloves, car abandoned. Fingerprints everywhere

Greatest opening sequence in cinematic history

The best Subaru commercial.

Movie good❤

This is stoopid. Why would anyone keep his earbuds in the whole time?

Wow that’s stupid

This is the second best opening scene of all time. Second only to The Dark Knight and Beating out Cars in third.

<a href="">1:31</a> I haven&#39;t watched Baby Driver before, but will this moment come into play later in the movie?

Overrated, with bad cinematography. Can&#39;t compare to the 70s or 80s.

being in the theater watching this the first time was so surreal. he  acts so calm with the music until it popped off. and was at the edge the entire scene

Vin diesel should be taking notes

Im not even nearly this good in gta

So the moment each robber lost their cool was when the glasses came off.

The best photography and stunt work (and editing) i&#39;ve seen in a car sequence... ever

Groovy.

My next urber ride

That engine and turbo sound... RB26DETT... WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THAT?!

Baby kadhaaaa

Who is better?Frank Martin (Transporter) or Baby (Baby Driver)?

This scene is dumb af

Eliza. Jesus.

they let the woman drive at the end? bad choice. jk

The helicopter pilot was stupid because all he had to do was follow the car with the vents on the hood the other cars didn’t have them

This film is utter crap

<a href="">3:08</a> <a href="">4:02</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I can BS on the lack of traffic in atlanta

This movie sucked stupid music all the time

Wow it makes me want to watch this

Ta mas na hora da troca de carros cade o dinheiro ?

<a href="">4:01</a> The phalanx of cop cars is when I laughed and checked out of the movie as anything but an extended music video.

“Hear-no-evil’s back, huh?”

... yes

As far as I&#39;m concerned, this scene is the perfect music video for Bellbottoms.

I often find car chases boring in movies but man I love this scene.

GGGGGGG

Hard to believe but even my wife liked this movie.

How many sets of tires did they go through in filming that scene?

&quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot; by Kavinsky syncs up to this scene almost effortlessly.

<a href="">5:21</a> puts his fingerprints all over the door. Ever heard of gloves?

<a href="">3:09</a> is that freaking punisher😮😮😮😮😮

Is this Haaland?

Such a magnificent scene....

Kevin Spacey pedo rapist

Y do I want the criminals to escape with the money they just robbed 😭😭😭😭

Crazy how I catch something new every single time I watch this opening scene, without fail. This time it was that the trees and the wall rushing by at <a href="">3:04</a> are somehow timed perfectly with the drums.

The most unbelievable part of this whole movie is the way the cops have any pursuit skills or planning whatsoever and their Crown Vics can even hope to keep up in traffic with a tuned WRX driven by someone with actual skill.

Woulda been cooler if it was an evo

I d like to see a movie where baby driver races against the transporter.

The silver Chevy Impala at the beginning is a nod to the movie Drive which also used a silver Chevy Impala in the begining.

need to give it to the stunt driver...

I have a sneaking suspicion that he&#39;s driving a automatic.

There were literally no cops when they left the bank. If they kept cool they might have reached the garage unoticed

Yo lo contrato para mi chofer personal 😎🇵🇪

This film won an Oscar for Editing.

Baby idiot!

I can&#39;t wait for the sequel, skuba driver

I know it&#39;s a movie, but APD and GSP would&#39;ve caught them boys before they hit 75 lol

2017 was a good year

Mediocre movie, but this scene is white hot fire. Without a doubt one of the greatest getaway scenes ever to exist, past, present, and future.

It seems they left a lot of fingerprints on that car they dumped.

28/7/23 I&#39;m still watching 😎👍

BELLBOOOOTTOMS

High point of the film - unfortunately.

im confused that baby isnt wearing gloves to keep his fingerprints off the wheel

One of my favorite things about this scene is how many changes they had to make to the WRX. The real car has too much grip to drive like that.

this is the longest any subaru drove without braking down

Yoo it&#39;s a subaru

Probably good film for those who have missed &quot;Taxi&quot; with Sami Nasiri .

This movie sucked

Spacey saying thats my baby, certainly has a different tone to it now.

Even though there were doing crazy things with Subaru, they still ended up with Toyota

One of the best openings to any movie ever.  PERFECT music choice.

I think this is my favorite movie

Whenever I rob banks I always use a bright red Subaru wrx….

Hello we&#39;ll race, also I lost my headphones. I don&#39;t like pods

Wow, he is so cool when he&#39;s dancing in the car. Look at him go!

Do a little dance, make a little love. Get down tonight!

What the hell is happening in Fear The Walking Dead

Gak apa2 gw biarin dulu lo semua pegang kendali.... &quot; Seperti biasa gw selalu bagian akhir. 😪

Quick question though...why is it that every single time he evades the police there&#39;s another car just...perfectly placed to follow him anyway? The cops may be good, but this one was just farcical with how well-timed the &quot;just arriving on scene&quot; cops were time after time after time. Even just once would have been weird, but it just. keeps. happening.I call bullshit.

i didn&#39;t know haaland was actor

ZZZzzzzzzz

Easier to drive like that with seatbelt.

I wanna learn how to drive like that

literally me

man this commercial showcasing the wrx is crazy

これの曲をNight of Fireにしたやつあったな

Sneak away from cops  and squealing tires😂

a subaru that sounds like an nissan skyline engine lol

I require a red 2008 WRX now and make it RWD.

This is me playing gta

bro left his fingerprints all up over that car

Finger prints everywhere!!!!

Literally best movie i&#39;ve seen... Absolutely in love with the story and characters! He was NOT slow!!And that suicide turn when they leave the bank 👌🤯

I don&#39;t know why, but I still prefer the remix with Sean Paul&#39;s &quot;Temperature&quot;... for some reason, that song made it even more badass. And I&#39;m a metal head/rocker.

lmao why is there a female?

Me gustaría borrar mi memoria para ver esta película otra vez

I always wonder what spaceys tire budget is

:)

Dom torertto who?

Subaru get&#39;s you through

Having an opening scene like this... you  know the movie&#39;s gonna be awesome

I love it when John Berthal signalling &quot;go&quot; by pointing forward and Baby backs up instead 😄😄

I&#39;d say this is the fourth best car chase scene form a movie.1. Drive (2011)2. Ronin (1998)3. Bullitt (1968)

4. Baby Driver (2017)

stupidly job

MONEY!

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Shane

as a major time car guy, this scene beats literally everything the fast and furious did. this is peak driving cinema

After just watching drive this is pure bafoonary

Just went driving in my coworkers Camaro during our shift and it was just like that…

Okay, sir liscense and registra-

Dream manhut irl?

i like how he continues driving like a maniac even after he threw off the policemen

Where do I watch this?

This Scene is great, but the rest of the flim is mediocre. They should have focused more on the driving and chase sequences, instead of creating a cheesy romance plot.

Mind-blowing driving men🔥🔥🔥

Topch noch mixtape🎉

AND, they just LEFT IT OPEN? Couldn&#39;t they have thrown a pink jacket and a random textbook inside it, and closed the door?   Maybe make sure said car was beside a bunch of other cars?

this should be a subaru commercial lol

never bring a Ford Crown Victoria to a rally!!!

whats the music?

Love the driving, but I hate driver is not wearing gloves, and leaves his fingerprints everywhere, including the bottle he throws into the back, and drumming on the outside door.  Then they don&#39;t park the car, but leave it in the middle of the parking lot with the doors open.  Seems like a lot to hope a care thief will find it before the cops.  Just leave it parked, unlocked with the keys in it and it will likely be stolen, or it will be days until the cops find it.  My willing suspension of disbelief is overstretched.  Jonathon Banks would never make such mistakes.

Вот что можно творить на механике.

is there some secrret meaning behind the license plate

Yeah, I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t leave DNA all over that car like that. Could&#39;ve at least locked it up to make it less obvious.

daily publicpower

This movie is like a cartoon version of DRIVE. Which is not a bad thing!

<a href="">02:30</a> Subaru

the way she says &quot;no!&quot; right before they cut off the RV is my favorite part

how gta players think they look

This movie Totally Inspired By The Guardian of the galaxy pitter quil

<a href="">5:08</a> Imagine if that cop checked his rear-view mirror

😵😵‍💫Drugs, fights, drunkenness, violence, 😆🤬 arrogance, pride, cursing, where do those who practice such things go? As far as I know from the word of God, it&#39;s not going to heaven. If you don&#39;t go to Heaven, you go to Hades, eternal suffering. It is worth it? Life here is fleeting, at the same time it does not pass in eternity. Come to Jesus✝ while there&#39;s still time!🕰⏲🕙

<a href="">1:55</a> I just love this guitar transition so nuch

So nice

Never noticed the punisher was here lol 😂💀

This is a better car chase scene than any other fast and furious movie 😂😂

Is that a WRX or Impreza?

All the comments here are nice and I totally subscribe to them but could we please just take a moment to appreciate the sheer brilliance of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion&#39;s BELLBOTTOMS track, without which I am convinced this scene wouldn&#39;t have come to existence at all (for I believe the scene was built around the soundtrack and not otherwise)

ну да ну да) отпечатки пальцев покинули чат 🤣🤣🤣

This made the entire fast n furious franchise look like a ball of cowsh*t

can someone tell me the name of this movie

This is my favorite opening scene in any film

no one is coming for you rose.

a gluttonous in my house

pose queen

Kevin Spacey saying, &quot;that&#39;s my baby.&quot;😬

I remember at the movies I yelled THIS WAS JUST THE INTRO?! real loud. Several people laughed....WHAT A GREAT TIME!!

Five years later and I still can&#39;t believe this man played Three Card Monte on the highway

when you play too much Need for Speed.

Very cool scene in this movie...

My motivation ❤

Sorry, but the APD persuing in perfect V formation was a bit much for me.

The police sirens sound like pac man noises.

Bro was in gta

Jon Spencer Blues Explosion

that&#39;s some slick drifting from an AWD vehicle.

<a href="">4:55</a> one of my favorite things about this scene is Buddy patting him on the back in support and grinning ear to ear. An oddly wholesome moment in an otherwise action packed scene.

I just realized he&#39;s dressed like Han Solo. &quot;I know a few maneuvers. We&#39;ll lose &#39;em.&quot;

Even though I know what&#39;s coming be I&#39;ve watched this so many times, I&#39;m still on the edge of my seat everytime i watch it!

SUBARU SALES PROLLY WENT CRAZY AFTER THIS MOVIE

AWESOME!!!   driving 😁👏👏👏👏👍😉         That&#39;s what you call driving on the limit.   😉    FAST &amp; FURIOUS or this 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 I would rather favour FAST &amp; FURIOUS  EXCEPT  3 Tokyo Drift. 👎👎👎👎👎😠😠😠    I Just couldn&#39;t watch that one i get very bored with that.  ( But,  that is personal preference)  But,  the rest are BRILLIANT!!!! including HOBBS &amp; SHAW 👍😉😁 Another is presumed to be in the making &amp; MAYBE!!!! released by end of Sept 2023 THAT&#39;S ONLY A MAYBE DON&#39;T QUOTE ME!!!   on it.    Do your own searching on it yourselves.

Meanwhile the Punisher is riding shotgun lol

Keloğlana uygun

Totally unrealisticIts a subaru, those G-forces the engine would be oil starved, develop a bottom end knock and overheat lolWhy use a subie for a getaway when itll blow upJust go toyota lol

<b>watchin</b>

Ee

This movie - at least this scene - reminds me of the movie &quot;The Driver&quot; starring Ryan O&#39;Neal and Bruce Dern.  O&#39;Neal plays the professional getaway driver and the driving he does in the movie parallels this driving. Right down to the expression on the driver&#39;s face.

Everything about this scene is amazing. The acting, the stunt driving, visuals, sound effects being synced with the music

As a film student I come here every once in a while to show myself how terrible I am

кринжа

❤❤❤

this dude definitely had no trouble with parallel parking

He did all that just to afford gas for his Subi

In reality the cops would&#39;ve just felt sorry as soon as they saw that the guy was driving a Subaru and would&#39;ve let them keep the money to get a better car. 🤣

Still weird they use a wrx not sti

ese we me la perez prado :D escuchando a charmin chorrea ...

Excellent choice of tyres. :DDD

Edgar Wright uses music in his movies better than any other filmmaker, the only other guy who comes close to Wright&#39;s ballpark is Tarantino.

He really is a demon behind the wheel!! He&#39;s not slow.

I dare you to press number 4 on the keyboard

He needs to be in fast and furious😭

Fast and furious needs this man

top 10 need for speed most wanted moment

Finally they don&#39;t take money to transfer car

CAN&#39;T WAIT FOR PART 2.

I Can’t drive like this in a Video Game UNBLEVABLE

Never forget this film <b>lost</b> the best editing Oscar

Best Subaru commercial ever

This scene introduced me to Jon Spencer and he blew my mind.

Spacey saying thats my baby takes on a whole new meaning but hey

This scene did more for car chases than the entire Fast and Furious franchise.

So F... Beautifully played!!

..&amp; not one seat belt was buckled that day.

Colin McRae would like dis

funny. the play station babies belive this! ha. you can drive! ha,

انه رائع

Often duplicated but never replicated...... Lol like finger prints!!!

There&#39;s this edit where the song is replaced by Deja Vu (the opening of Initial D), and I think I prefer that one over the original.

One of the best chase scenes in movie history!

<a href="">4:44</a> average brake check in ATL daily commute

That cocky finger point forward from Jon Bernthal is such a vibe. Every viewer now knows they&#39;re about to see the opposite of what they expect for the next 2 hours.

I&#39;m sold. Gonna watch this movie!

I totally did not expect to like this movie (I was dragged to the theater by my kids), but it was much better than I anticipated.

Interviewed Jon Spencer once, he told me the song inspired Wright to make the film.

Bro gotta stop playing gta 5

That driving was majestic. 😧😧😧

gfy

I like how Bellbottoms doesn’t score this scene, the scene scores Bellbottoms

this is what i expect when i hit priority on uber eats

&quot;Passenger thinks skilled drivers going to crash in tight space and starts yelling&quot; cliche <a href="">3:22</a>

Not sure who outran the APD better. The Duke boys or this dude. Both were some good scenes though.

Good movie!

whats with the roofliner stains?

Professionals without gloves!

<a href="">3:22</a> just loooooved it🤣🤣🤣

Research Donald Marshall on Human Cloning and Vril! Save the World!

BABY BOOM!! BOMB

I don&#39;t know if Edgar Wright intended this pun or not but...A Three CAR Monty!

They&#39;ll be in big trouble if they get caught, none of them are wearing seat belts!

What movie is it

4 door saloon with rally performance gotta love subarus

Good driving scenes. Bad movie.

I&#39;ve seen this intro with deja Vu added to it and it&#39;s so much better that the song actually playing makes the scene worse to me

Enjoyed this scene a lot. I prefer the opening of drive because was more tense and realistic whereas this is more slick and entertaining

Even though it is a movie but he is crazy, intelligence  and perfect

What every GTA Heist feels like in our heads

Only God knows how many times I’ve rewatch this master piece of movie

<a href="">3:25</a> literally the only reason I wanted to see the movie.

I thought the driver would be a baby in Baby Driver…But sure a person ho is driving like an insane maniac outrunning the cops cause they robbed a bank works out too.

Jesus Christ Loves You All❤❤❤✝️❤️

Rob a bank in broad daylight with virtually no disguise. Then let your getaway driver leave prints all over the car. That&#39;s a brilliant plan, ese!

Great movie...miss seeing kevin spacey in roles.

The kids a bit of a flog tbh.🤡

Down town Atlanta!!

I am just now realizing that the reason Baby goes backwards instead was because he noticed the cop car going by so he knew that would most likely be the closest cop car to head to the scene so he improvised to avoid it

This film really is severely underrated. A pity because the director insisted on practical FX for all of the chase/crash sequences. Even the car falling out of the parking garage at the end was not CGI or miniature work. They literally dropped a REAL car.

jon spencer blues explosion !

I hate that they leave the doors open. They did everything perfect but such a small detail would draw attention to the car and they’d be pulling dna off it asap cuz it would make them think it was the right Subaru.

“That’s my baby.”

I can&#39;t watch this without the Spitfire ost played over stuck in my head

I&#39;ve always loved the &quot;well played, kid&quot; shoulder touch Jon Hamm gives Baby.

The dumbest decision to take a red car.

One of the best Subaru ads ever done lol.... Too bad they are not focused on that segment anymore.

<a href="">2:42</a> was the car interior roof burned or what ?

he would fasho cause attention to himself lmao

Let go Hillsong Y&amp;F?

but... the wrx is fwd

Decided to finally check this movie out and I immediately had to come back to this scene after finishing it, it&#39;s just so great!

what a bimbominchia movie...

S U B A R U

This Da Real Baby Right Here Mne &amp; He Know Wtf He Doing Behind Da Wheel ❤🤷‍♂️

nul !!

Favourite opening scene to any movie

Y&#39;know, the more I watch this film, and this opening scene... the only reason the dude in the front is so mad is because he points forward... Baby then drives backwards.Homie ruins a reaaaal good thing

As a kid I never knew this was lowkey a Subaru ad😂

What a beautiful openning

The only thing that really really bugs me about this scene is that nobody in tbe car is wearing their seatbelts! One quick stop and these guys could easily bump thei face against the seat and BOOM, one nosebleed and that car is tracked to you immediately

so this is a really bad stupid remake of DRIVER 2011 which was a bad-remake of THE DRIVER from 1978 basically

unfortunatly this is the first and unique good scene in that movie.

bro driving a car in that speed and the maneuvering would make my stomach on easy. Wallahi I&#39;m finished 😂

I am a huge Edgar Wright fan, but I cannot sit through this film.  It just tries way too hard to be cool, and it simply isn&#39;t.

As an ATL-ien, it&#39;s also fantastic because it&#39;s basically correct. You can pretty much do exactly this on exactly those streets. Those are the legit one-ways and weird turns. Much respect.

Late?

Finger prints left in the Subaru ?

Now that is the need for speed!

Fun fact he bought the car

Wow goddamn

<a href="">2:08</a><b>im about to do what is called a pro gamer move</b>

And that ladies and gentlemen is how you make fast n furious look bad

Every time I see this scene I get chills, it’s so cool

Have only seen great clips...is he autistic?

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️

The movie is terrible 😒👎🏾 over hyped... The ending could&#39;ve done better

I would be fearing for my life if I was in the car

The best movie

Baby can now upgrade to air pods

1 like = 1 kiss from baby

Pulling off heists with this playing on GTA V &quot;Self radio&quot; 😎

they left their finger prints on the car.

Man! Who actually drives that car!?

This scene feels like a whole GTA online heist

See this Fast and Furious? This is how you do great action/stunt with cars

&quot;go forward&quot; baby driver: nah finna do it tokyo drift style

This movie was so bad.    Really bad.

that&#39;s how i used to play nfs most wanted 2005 🤘

greatness of the scene is that it sets up like he&#39;s an odd kid with special needs and then turns out he&#39;s an awesome driver

This was the best driving he did in the entire movie.

Pfft.  A man never leaves his ride.But it was a cool chase scene.  Guess I&#39;ll have to rent it and check it out.

syamu_game

Baby in driver so sad in driver, pure selling.(mending SUBARU ya, dari pd upah drivernya ga adil)🤣😔

After seeing the first 2 minutes of this thankfully I would never see this movie this totally looks like crap

<a href="">2:43</a> you&#39;re clear, don&#39;t attract attention.... proceeds to fly past a cop.

この少年は四輪歩行の生物

the song makes this scene. thankyou the jon spencer blues explosion.

The best driving scene ever!!!

They do be dripping with them white shoes.

HAALAND

No GD green screen. Jesus I hate cgi so much now a days. Par for the course for how bad most movies are now. Even the writers on most movies phone it in.

GREAT FLICK!

This guy must love music so much.

When this thing hit&#39;s 98 mile an hr, yr gona see sum serious ...........................feb invasion.

I don&#39;t know why, but I find the flip-a-switch change from stoic to singing his heart out so adorable.

This guy was playing grand theft auto in real life lol

Me from India, went to this movie without any expectations, there were only 10+ guys there. Man, I gotto tell you all, I just enjoyed the movie... one of the best ever I saw..

one of the best movies ever made!

A lot of fingerprints ...

Is there anything better than driving alone.

Mujer la concha tu madre

What a stupid movie.  The writers are a joke.

Stain in my pants

What a load of crap.  And, as usual, they disable the thumbs down tracker.

This movie was, and still is, a total riot from start to finish. My only complaint is that more time should&#39;ve been given to develop the love story so Debora&#39;s decisions in the finale wouldn&#39;t seem so stupid, but that&#39;s such a small problem in very well-made movie. This scene alone makes this movie an instant classic! The stunt-work, cinematography, and soundtrack/editing are superb! I&#39;m still in shock that my in-laws didn&#39;t care for it - makes me question who I married.

gta irl

Is this guy even old enough to drive?

His fingerprints are all over that car you know.

2.5 I. Add music lead foot ..engage

Bare hands, touching the Subaru all over, leaving all SORTS of prints on it, and then leaving the doors open as they leave, making it significantly more suspicious for anyone who finds it.Great plan, that.

Not a great film ,,,,,but brilliant  sound track including  some great northern soul 👍 👌

Wow..and I thought I was the best that ever was.

is this the inoffical Driver 2 `? i thought i read something about that..

A Guy listen iPod 24/h cmon this is bullshit

Just like when the police boys try to catch me in the skill based full loot not pay to win MMORPG called Albion online 🙃

Street take over hoodlums and creeps LOVE this movie!

...but why leave the doors open?

Ansel Allegort is the best actor and artist. I hope he will reply to me from Iraq🤦🏻‍♀️💜💜💚💕

Водила ебейший

Eiza Gonzalez

A ridiculous movie and the performance of all the actors was a shameful performance and the actor Jimmy Foxx fell in this movie a big fall and reduced his stardom and fame because he acted in this ridiculous movie

these police spawn in like need for speed.

This scene is still better then very fast and furious movie made combined

I thought this chase was soundtracked “Brighton Rock”.Couldn’t they get the rights for this clip?

<a href="">5:18</a> nobody is inside the car.

At <a href="">0:00</a> you can hear a ringing sound, which is what Baby would listen to all the time, and then it transitioned into the sound of the string in the Bellbottoms song intro. just genius!

I watch this to start my day. Gets me pump

AgainAgain 😁

that&#39;s how you drive. from the very start. they told him to go forward, and he goes backwards because he knows it would be unexpected and give him a few extra seconds to show the middle finger to the cops.this guy knows how to drive fast but that&#39;s not his best quality. he&#39;s aware of his surroundings and the psychology of those that pursue him. he used the music as a way to relax and justify why it was there doing nothing inside the car. we can also see that the rest isn&#39;t aware of this since we see a change in his behavior as soon as he&#39;s alone and goes back to a more serious attitude when they leave the bank.the trick with the other two red cards is great but, what I like about it is that it shows those two cards were there by simple chance, he saw them, improvised and forced one of them to swap places so the cops would follow the wrong car.masterfully.it&#39;s not the best pursuit scenes I have ever seen but the very best doesn&#39;t count since it&#39;s part of an anime. this is the second best pursuit.

DAMN i wanna see this movie now, considering the fact that i took my first driving lesson about a week ago and automatically noticed he was wearing headphones which is illegal, i was instantly intrigued just by how he danced along with his car through the music he played, which was also so amazing woooo

tmmist geil

I like to think that the other actors in the car weren&#39;t told what he was going to do

Nice music

These 6 minutes are better then the whole Fast and Furious franchise.

Kevin Spacey screws up this movie.

How many times I ❤ watching this trailer

I&#39;m honestly sick of channels like yours taking a perfectly fine 21:9 file and rendering it out to 16:9 degrading the quality of it before YouTube gets a chance to degrade it further.You don&#39;t need to change the aspect ratio! Just post a clip in it&#39;s native aspect ratio!

Scene is awesome, although, my mind always circles back to fingerprints left on the abandoned supra, lol

Was he slow?

No camera shakes. Just a clear view of chase scene. Perfect

sucks knowing now that Ansel was accused of sexual harrassment cuz i really liked him but its always the ones u least expect, what a shame

This is then east opening scene of any movie. Fight me.

хуйня какая-то

<a href="">2:35</a> definitely underrated! Griff expecting Baby to drive forward, not reverse

such a shame kevin spacey tanked this movie cause of the timing of his alligations

I wish I had the last <a href="">5:56</a> of my life back.

wow

こんなに心躍るオープニングはいつまでたっても色あせないよなぁ

When I see a fury

any movie that makes a car chase interesting is a win

Transporter had better chase scenes.

and all without gloves, they didn&#39;t even burn the old car))

This scene made me get a WRX and even though its regularly needing repairs I still wouldnt swap it for the world

Why is he parking on the other side of the road in front of the bank?

OMG Duc Phuc , i like your cover version. Love it !

The scene will never not be awesome.  The version with Deja Vu overlaid on it though is also hilariously accurate.

Is no one gonna mention they all 4 left their fingerprints on the door handles

good video.

Makes me miss midnight Club 3: DUB edition.

Oh... that&#39;s why The Punisher didnt show up in &quot; The Defenders &quot;

I never understood this movie.  He never drives a baby, and he&#39;s not a baby.  So, I don&#39;t get it.

He playing GTA in real life 🤣

Too much fantasy in the pursuit, specially with the whole red cars but still was very Good

NOPE. They need to re-make this with a diverse cast, crew and director.

This is the best film I have ever watched. Also Subaru Impreza WRX STI 2004 is my dream Car :)

The driver, Drive and Baby driver, a holy thrinity of the movies

I really enjoyed this movie,  but what really stands out to me is this scene was in my city of Atlanta!

2 other red Subarus arriving just in time to fool the helicopter crew.  What are the chances of that happening.  It&#39;s a stylishly daft film but I enjoyed it.

Bebe

Lol

Movie producers: “Ok, how much does a car company want to pay to sponsor this opening scene?”Subaru: “Yes.”

gazimba blorp, zutoozi! gargalure!

This is good, but that video where they edited Gas Gas Gas to this scene was goldenAlso I hope they add this particular scene as a mission in GTA 6 (whenever it come outs)

I&#39;ve never understood why American film makers (&amp; Americans in general) don&#39;t seem to understand how manual transmissions work.

I never wanted a subaru so much in my life lol

Edgar wright is easily one of the best directors working today and this scene is proof of that.

<a href="">2:38</a> is stoopid good. Ridiculous shot.

Somebody once told me that this movie could be labeled as a musical, and I kind of agree with it.

<a href="">0:27</a> this facial expression is giving Debbie Ryan

down town atlantaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

<a href="">2:34</a> my favorite part

This clip sold me on the movie. Gotta watch it now.

Sorry Bullet, time to move down to 2nd place and yield to the new car chase scene!

Cool scenes on 75 unfortunately 75 don’t ever look like that now. 🤣

&quot;Is he slow?&quot;&quot;No&quot;

Gotta appreciate the fact to got as many crown Vics as they could even though in real life most of them have been replaced by Explorers and Chargers

this scene will never be the same for me after watching the Deja Vu edit

while this is a great scene, Drive opening chase scene is way more suspenseful.

SUPRA 🔥

Although I like this movie, watch the intro to the movie Drive..It&#39;ll blow your mind

The opening showing of trhis was spectacular.

Kevin Spacey saying &quot;That&#39;s my baby&quot; aged like fine milk

Hey what&#39;s happening I&#39;ve purchase this movie blue ray DVD this&#39;s awesome movie 👋👍🙂🚘

Iconic.

I love the fact that they used the nismo mustang engine sound clips for 90% of this from F&amp;F Tokyo Drift.

Movie chase scenes no longer make any sense at all.

Does someone know where can I watch this film for free ??

See Fast &amp; Furious ? This is how a perfect and entertaining pursuit looks like. No need to jump off buildings and do Superman jumps.

when dad says i want you home in 5 minutes

This was so goood the action thee dramaaaaaa remember watching this a year ago when it was released i can&#39;t stop watching it over and over again.

What every GTA Online player aspires to be.

Vin diesel will invite him to join his family 😂

how Subaru drivers think they look: <a href="">3:25</a>VS.How Subaru drivers actually look: <a href="">5:30</a>

There was a roblox video that I just watched and it was this video but roblox jailbreak

I like how they picked a red Subaru as their getaway car. I guess making yourself feel more badass helps you go faster and think smarter. You&#39;d think a nice black or dark blue would do better, though.

Fingerprints left all over the steering wheel and on driver door side panel after he slapped it in time with the music beat. A criminal genius. A stupid point to irk me but it does.

Most iconic hawkeye subaru

Best editing and choreography I&#39;ve ever seen for a pursuit.

The best thing about this movie are Lily James legs. Theyre killer.

when you feel the song too much

Turn it up!

To date this is one of my favorite movies ever.

Looks wack

It&#39;s hilarious how he happened to cross road with the other two red cars

This scene just need Lily Jame to be perfect.

I watched the movie while i was in a high speed car...... The experience was awesome 😂

Everyone should know how to drive a standard....!

The very beginning of this clip has the high pitched sound of tinnitus.

<a href="">5:48</a> that didnt aged well...

Sema .. 👌 👌 👌 👌

Dad I want a gtr sorry wrx

In reality .... fails road test twice.

finger prints on the sterring

Oh to be able to drive like that🤗

in sweden, the driver wouldnt have to worry about the police.

I have one of those iPods.. The battery doesn&#39;t last long though..

227hp wrx turd with 4 adults to weigh it down...bigger turd....

maybe ken block, but not you little boy...

That reverse pullout, so good.

Nobody will confuse a Subaru, chev and a VW.

This is one of the best openings of all time!

Love the chase. Hate the music.

No gloves for driving? Reckless 🤣🤣

why bsj is in a movie bro wtf

It&#39;s definitely once in a lifetime movie experience and one of the best movies I have ever seen There is something about It&#39;s drama romance and action and this bit of over the edge scenes that will make this movie unforgettable.

Video clip of allmost all the songs

Amazing.

THE BEST!

Best chase scene ever ❤️ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Mans the best get away driver

GTA is so good it even has a movie about it.

<a href="">3:32</a> - The professional driver or the pilot never looks down to check the shift lever.

This movie opening alone beats the whole fast and the furious franchise.

Thats how u do an intro so nice

he just like me fr fr

Great movie

They look sus

Best Subaru car commercial ever.

I hate this on so many aesthetic levels...

Anyone got 2 red car for rental I need it by this weekend for practice

this movie gotta get a part 2!!!!

Yet then gets questioned when a clear nut job like JLF gets used in the crew. Can’t win lad

Losing the cops in GTA be like

ljkmuytfdytgkjhg8y6fgoıı098tg87ftuılhguyfgıukjhgyutıufklkupşy98t67trgtydjytrufhgıukyşı7rp769jgthhstreoı98t856f  höökguljkıre5hsgşjo

In your face Toretto!!!!

Nothing says inconspicuous like a red car

The way they both look at each other in the beginning 😍

and this is not even the fastest Subaru - it is simply a WRX, not an STI

Movie is so unrealistic. I didn’t see any head gasket smoke at all

Do they have mechanic box on Ford.. still?

この動画らいねも残してほしいですよ来年も残してくださいね？

いいね👍😊

とても良いですね！

Thsi gives such a nostalgic NFS MW 2005 vibes.

I like to watch this scene in the morning before work to give me a boost

When serious talent meets perfect choice of music magic happens

No way pro criminals wud choose a RED getaway car..so stupid

This movie hella bit DRIVE...and Drive was a way better movie..with a way better opening scene

Best music video

☺️

Sorry, but after the fault in our stars I will never be able to see the driver as anyone else!

They left their fingerprints when they exit the car.. -_-

Can anyone explain why Tarantino has a cult following.  So many are soooo much better than he is.

...stupid and bad scene...

Right cos there just happened to be 2 red cars driving next to each other

no me convenció el sonido es terrible a comparación de la película

love how American films think 80 mph is fast 😂😂

I still never understood why he doesn&#39;t drive the 2nd car.

Now this is the real GTA 6 damn!!!

such wow

The fact, that they used a red STI and not a blue one really grinds my gears.

dumb as hell.  glad i missed this trash.

Baby driver knew whose lap to sit in on the casting couch .. I’m sure Kevin spacey trained him how to drive stick shift

i thought baby in baby driver must be girl ,but girls cant drive

Legendary!

I get bricked up everytime I see this shot <a href="">3:22</a>

Love the covid-style face diapers.

RIP ipods

Oie, gostei do seu canal ja me inscrevi!

i cant believe 😱😱😱😱😱

toyota.

try and slow down bro

fast &amp; furious 25

makes a good movie but not a good escape strategy

the movie is this scene

exactly how teamwork works

I still say tyrone is the better get-a-way driver. He did a rally course.

@<a href="">3:52</a> - Passengers gone 😂😂

I really like Jon Hamm&#39;s look in this. Interesting pivot after Mad Men. Can&#39;t wait to see more!

This is how you immediately get 7 stars in San Andreas

Tokyo Drift ain&#39;t got nothin on my boy

That&#39;s just the first 5 minutes. You should see the rest.

Horrible movie. Just dumb Hollywood trash.

The cops didn’t even see them leave. They could’ve just driven away normally.

Like something out of GTA

If he would have drove slow.... no cops would have followed him

Kevin Spacey

we liked this flicker picture.

Every dude with a red subie has an insane positive bias towards this movie

Is it a children&#39;s movie? enough views for a scene like this? I go back to the introductory scene of THE DARK NIGHT by Nolan, Even the French film &quot;TAXI 1&quot; is doing its own course here, it&#39;s just fake. Ahhahhh!

Because you want a bright red car when you do a bankrupt

This was horrible film

Stupid scene... The kids attracting more attention with his driving than voiding being noticed, But I guess this message sells.

This movie is really fun. Just thought I should share that. Also, I just noticed that Baby is dressed like Han Solo.

It&#39;s good... Still below Jason Bourne&#39;s car chases.

The fact that ansel elgort looks so much like one of my friends makes this scene so much better

Everyone is unbelted!

The 3 dudes wear gloves and masks because they can’t leave fingerprints they have been to prison and possibly have criminal recordsBaby is so good he hasn’t been caught and doesn’t have any records or police reputation so it doesn’t matter if he got fingerprints on the car because they’d have no matchAt least that’s my head cannon

This movie is so amazing.

If we are making a movie about a professional driver....maybe make sure he doesn&#39;t hit the spike strip in the shot...?

Wow

Lost interest about 5 min. in. Pablum for the easily entertained.

the closest GTA movie we are gonna ever get

Best Subaru commercial ever ! I want a WRX now 😂

I love a good car chase scene (being a child of the 80s, I practically grew up on them) and this is without a doubt one of the best ever.

the option is watching primitive building pool or this

this scene alone made me fall in love with the impreza

That WRX couldn’t pull away from those crappy cop cars even when it was pushed to the limit

PERFECT.

Bright red for a getaway car?  Nope.

God knows how many times i have watched this

i wonder if the car costs more than the money they stole

Have I just noticed there&#39;s nobody in the Back of the Scooby Doo... when the camera exits the bank robber scenes in the back of the car ???

The car chases in &#39;Baby Driver&#39; literally made my buttocks quiver like jelly, so exciting and the music really enhanced them.

To be honest The Driver and Drive are way better than this.

kevein spacey : &quot;thats my baby&quot; lol

Ограбление банка под музыку.

I know it&#39;s just a movie, but to think of it - all the execution is just laughable...

This is why Edgar Wright one of the best directors out there

<a href="">0:46</a> - COVID standard precautions, right?

love ansel elgort. such a good actor.

111

you cant see that movie without DEJA-Vu soundtrack.... than speedboy..... speed lover

I&#39;d like to see a race between this kid and the Transporter.

this movie was so corny

i thought this movie was avg at best

Мусора всегда были на хвосте и при этом ехали без понтово, не как он, в чем смысл =))))))))))

This opening scene made me go watch the whole movie. Damn was it a good movie.

I&#39;m just as impressed with the cops that they never let up on him as if they were spawning into existence like in GTA.

I support this movie because this shows women driving relatively safe.

One of the best driving sceens ever

Niice

Most Wanted 🤏👈👍😅😂😅🤣🙏💯💥

finger prints finger prints finger prints

Camelot311 before youtube

Why does it take three hands to close the damn trunk?

This movie sucks.

His fingerprints are all over the steering wheel and I&#39;d assume the police will dust for prints when they find the car abandoned in the parking lot.

This scene tells you everything you need to know about the character. When Baby&#39;s driving, Baby is in charge.

Could have done with more Noel Fielding, Julian Baratt and Nick Frost :)

When they drive by the pillars in the parking zone it matches the music

See THIS is how you do a driving scene. Fast and Furious, take notes

Best scene in the HOLE movie

Ultimately a turgid clunker with a little boy attempting to be Steve McQueen.   Stick to matchbox kid.

The psychotic valley preferably bore because soy perioperatively stuff absent a odd digger. bad, tired jaw

surprised the engine didn&#39;t blow up

What a BS film. Not a realistic driving scene in the entire movie.

Brilliant scene, if only I could suspend my disbelief that traffic in Atlanta would ever be that light ....

Nice pursuit!

This opening sequence should have instantly won the respect of everyone in the crew. I never got that. He did his job to perfection and then some. That’s all you can ask from from whatever cog in the wheel of an operation.

One of the craziest opening scenes

At <a href="">4:55</a> Jon Hamm&#39;s character is like: &quot;Kid, you just earned my respect.&quot;

Pelicula de Disney

A non-Fast and furious movie that has more racing than the actual Fast and Furious movies?

this is obviously stupid and ridiculous. and you cant wear headphones while doing precision driving cuz you cant hear the engine.

Atlanta traffic is never this empty

Pure fake crap.

Didn&#39;t see the movie.  Was the 3 red car, 3 card Monte thing part of the plan?

LOVE the turbo sound on that STI, sound designers did an amazing job with that

Drive 2.  The prequel

Wow! When I thought they ran out of movie ideas

Maybe let’s pick a more discreet getaway car than a red wrx 🤣 and maybe let’s drive normally once we’ve eluded police successfully

What I’m more surprised at is that Edgar Wright used the raw song throughout the whole scene without any cuts of anything

So, the kid sings into a water bottle with bare hands and throws it into the back seat. They abandon the vehicle. Ruined an excellent opening.

Nope and nothing obvious about a bright red car either.

No Nothing obvious about them.

Dom to baby-&quot;You are my family&quot;

Good song selection🤗

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This clip better then all of the other racing movies

I am not impressed.

great scene but i dont think any tires would last that long)

one thing is the police find that car and finger print it they got the drivers on the door and steering wheel

Now we know another reason why he keeps Baby around

She made it clap

Why it&#39;s not DEJA VU?

Why didn&#39;t they edit out him hitting the tire spikes? Ran right over them but his tires are <i>special</i> cuz he&#39;s BABY DRIVER

Glad I haven&#39;t seen this poorly made movie!!!  Movie starts off the exact same as The Transporter movie. (1000% better of a movie!)  In this chase scene we just saw, cop cars all of a sudden appear for that stretch of road.  Just dumb!

Us WRX owners make mad passionate love to this..

Make me wanna Subaru. Nice!

Loved it!

This is why I still drive a stick and require my sons to learn to- because you can actually drive in more dimensions.

I was here.

Anyone else notice only the driver is in the car while drifting?  They coulda at least put crash dummies in the other seats..

&quot; That&#39;s my Baby ! &quot;

Baby on my mind😅😅😅

Say what you want about the mediocrity of the plot. This is a film with technical perfection telling a story that can only be told in a movie medium.A novel about this will be bland, a comic book without the rich soundtracks and sound will not be able to tell the story of baby&#39;s unique condition. It has a rich cast of characters as well.This is movie done right.

Bro this remindes me so much of GTA5 like all the try hards that drift all around the city

That&#39;s how it looks when I&#39;m running from the cops on GTA, EXACTLY like that. 😂

Me seeing them wear a mask before going in a public area: Oh how responsible they are to prevent from spreading COVID.<b>Checks date of release of movie</b> Ah...This was before

GTA like escape

Unrealistic to the core. In reality, sunglasses and headphones are more of a hindrance if you want to drive like this. That such a young man already has so much experience to be able to drive like this is also unrealistic. But Hollywood, the films are never logical. No wonder the film was a flop. The character is unrealistic and boring.

Best Subaru commercial ever.

Kevin Spacey says...&quot;hes my Baby&quot;...jepp i feel that...ups didnt there was a thing with sexual thing with him? :D

Me walking casually in the Garage..Meanwhile some people come in a super fast car and leaves all doors open ..

Anyone watch nopixel and just think of &quot;really air 1 for this&quot;

Was it ever explained why the main character has the moniker &quot;Baby&quot;  ?? Rather bizarre to see that Dan Draper chose a life of crime after leaving the advertising game.   Also, would Baby have been just a good getaway driver if he&#39;d listened to Spike Jones ??

<a href="">5:07</a> What a silence. Window open and there&#39;s nothing special to hear behind us.

I just love how quickly they go from fearlessly robbing a bank to fearing for their lives the second he starts driving

This is a remake of the french movie called : &quot;Taxi&quot;

Lol people are overrating this hard. It was a decent opening but nothing amazing.

la pelicula mas pelotuda que jamas vi

This is the longest Subaru ad I’ve ever watched

&quot;yes i know what im doing&quot;

im a better drive B)

They left the money in a car with open doors and the keys on the ignition.

&#39;oh no...stop watch this movie video at 054...not good action because of shadow problem

Wish they used a better song.

this is gta

Why do they call him &quot;Baby&quot; driver?

Vážně se ten kokot musí koukat na to, co tam dává za rychlost, ty vole? :D :D

Ladies n Gents, I give you the Scoobie Impreza :D

Meanwhile Subaru suspension be like: 🗿🗿🗿

That woman 🤦🏼‍♂️😍😍😍

This is so stupid

They forget to blow up the getaway car...

The madly tyvek multivariately bump because active undeniably beam vice a  fascinated area. humorous, skillful glass

🚗

Fine. Ill watch it again for the 7th time.

No gloves leaving prints on the car.  Parks across the street so they waist time running from the bank to the car.  Stock suspension as it bottoms out in the turns.  Unique, high visibility painted vehicle. Amateur hour

BELLBOTTOMS!!! BELLBOTTOMS!!!!

SUBIE

Baby Driver and Kevin Spacey together just doesn&#39;t sound good anymore.

Man’s just vibin the whole movie

i love the little smirk she does

Why isn&#39;t anyone wearing their seatbelt tho?!

so, The Transporter with lip sync?

Erling haaland ??? Is that u?

As someone who is even just minimally familiar with the streets these were filmed on, there is always so much traffic on these streets this would never actually happen.. during banking hours at least.

Thats one of the worst bank robbery scenes I have ever seen..

Lucky the writers killed off kevin spacey character XD for the sequel

Echoing silence .. on really fine wheels .. great fun (&amp; I don’t drive !?) turned me on to now get the film.  Subbed.

great driving skills but he forgot to put on his seatbelts 😂😂,without seatbelt on that level of driving is impossible ❤

<a href="">0:48</a> viajeros del tiempo cuidandose del Covid

The efficacious jumper multivariably preach because skiing eventually sniff off a tall samurai. incandescent, medical sweater

I would never support anything of Kevin Spacey’s ever again!

This is so fake… Jon Hamm could never comfortably sit in the back seat of an Impreza. 😂

One of the best beginnings to a movie zero to sixty in 5 secs lol

That is NOT a baby driving a car! CLICKBAIT.

The Best Subaru Commercial I Have Seen So Far...

When he goes in between the other two red cars and then switches to the left to lose the helicopter is still one of the slickest moves Ever

One&#39;s thing&#39;s for sure.  That&#39;s not a stock WRX.

Sorry boys, this is only a movie with very unrealistic driving sequences. I have been driving for over 20 years now and I have to say , yes that Subaru can perform in the right hands of a rally driver for example, but this actor,  come on. Great stunt work and driving techniques, but please do not believe that this kid actor can pull this driving on his own. There are lots of movies depicting a gateway driver from Transporter to F&amp;F but no kids, if this was in real life, this Subaru will  be reduce to swiss cheese by law enforcement  with all the occupants inside. No law enforcement  agency will tolerate some punk being a gateway driver in a red Subaru driving in their city like that.

ive never been one for watching movies (except for things like avengers, star wars, etc) im typically a tv show guy, but ill say this when i first watched this movie i rewatched it many times. Dont know what it is about it but definitely one of my favorites

<a href="">3:26</a> drove through

nice advertising subaru )

Genius !

Fast and furious should hire him

Top 10 stupidest movies to have this cast. The opening scene alone is so comical, they trust some kid from the 80&#39;s, a dime a dozen by the way, who plays too much video games with there freedom. Too unrealistic, good thing i didn&#39;t spend money watching it, well the first 30 minutes before I changed the channel

1/10, APD could never possibly put more than 3 officers onto any one situation at a time smh. too unrealistic

Really? Looks pretty dumb. Not even that good of a car chase. Lame. But for so many it will be cool as can be.

Great video keep it up!

One of the BEST stunt driving scenes in movies.  GONE in 60 Seconds is up there as well.

Brilliant use of music in this movie. Awesome soundtrack.

&quot;I can do that, but I don&#39;t wanna.&quot;

Memories

Who got reminded of playing Need For Speed Most Wanted?

Love this movie brings so many classic vibes a masterpiece:).

<a href="">3:10</a> He was doing 60mph lol I drive like that on a normal day

影片中的經典

It`s really crazy scene

A red car for a heist

Понятно, хотели показать оторванность и безбашенность. Но такое поведение привлекает внимание, лишние исходя из ситуации.

l would like too

The most contrived and unbelievable car chase scene I have ever seen in my life. What utter crap. The producer should be ashamed of himself. I doubt if he ever drove anything, other than a golf ball, in his life.

Any caper that involves a high speed chase is FAILED before it began.

<a href="">0:42</a> .....nah, they don&#39;t look suspicious.

This scene is awesome but the part at <a href="">4:42</a>, where Baby drives in front of the car to his left, then jams his brake so that the guy would switch lanes:If that other driver was already on the left most lane, that just means he was intending to take the exit on the left. Even if he was forced to change to the middle lane so he doesn&#39;t crash into Baby, why would he then not change back to the left lane afterwards so that he can take the exit on the left? Or just because some crazy driver jams his brake in front of him he decides to go to some other destination instead lolIt&#39;s still a great scene, I&#39;m just over-analyzing it.

Wonder how many times Spacey tried to touch baby driver

This movie is what Drive should&#39;ve been.

If Subaru&#39;s show that as add of they cars are very good everybody will buy it after that....

this little kid would smash on the 1st corner XD next time find a 10yo child for this role.

Does America make cars anymore?

What if someone does this on a vr headset

These cop cars must have 1000HP+ they keep catching up instantly after each corner 😂😂

Imagine a crossover of the movie Baby driver and Fast and Furious , Our minds and streets cars just blowing away

i was intimidated bec. tha driver was literally a baby 🥴

wow really stupid

Umm but he didn&#39;t wear gloves and left finger prints all over the car they would be at his house by dark 🤦‍♂️🤣

👍🏼💵🔮

Gta irl

Could have just driven like a normal person from the beginning and wouldnt have raised suspicion? 😂

Well, the forensic department will atleast have all their fingerprints. They are all over the red car.

This movie looks so stupid ! Three people that look like hit-men with duffel bags walk into a bank, nobody on the street, conspicuous red car driving really fast away from a robbery,  but the driving is cool.

Dude, the part where the 3 of them are storming out of the bank, the music is amping up, the engine is revving and baby’s changing gears. No better way to let the audience know “Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines and strap on in!” Masterpiece and goosebumps every time

It must be the 4th of July!

he&#39;s eveding all police car and yet manage to go straight to get away vehicle lol

This guy just left all his finger prints on the wheel, in a public opened car. Hope the car gets stolen before the police finds it. I know the movie doesn&#39;t end up that way, but in the real world we never know

Car pursuit…..“never seen before“ yaaaawn

then kevin spacey bummed him

Must admit...FINALLYSomeone that just might drive asmite bit better then me?

one of the most brilliant opening scenes in movie history

Is there any rally driver who could give as insight about this scenes that is it possible in real life or not ?

They simply left their red car with doors wide open? That was not very smart.

What a fantastic opening and all credit to the actors but more importantly the stunt driver(s). Some of the best driving I&#39;ve seen in any movie!

This looks live adaptation of NFS Mostwanted

sa lol

Finally somebody made a justice to a Impreza WRX

👍

those poor tires

1. Please stop reinventing French Connection over and over and over again.2.The repetitive music piece db’s over the top of all the other audio in the scene is disturbingly bad and it spoils what is already annoying in the context of the overtly bad quick edits… 3. The simplistic quick edits although easier and safer in shooting and production, destroys the true THRILL of much longer better planned faster straight car driving sequences.

The smurf in the lobby that&#39;s finally got the opportunity to clutch a round:

The wrong yak immunocytochemically consider because college realistically wipe alongside a shut sudan. truthful, versed country

So, three questions. At <a href="">3:24</a>, do you use both your regular brakes <b>and</b> the handbrake? And, assuming you shift gears, how do you do it so smoothly (from high speed to low)? Also, do you press the clutch (fully) as you brake? Asking for my grandmother.

The only redeeming scene of the whole film, otherwise uninspiring

Edgar Wright is one of my favorite directors and this movie is the reason why

I slept on this movie for so long because I got it mixed up with &#39;Boss Baby&#39;.

A fast car would have been a better choice.

Don’t like this kid at all.

An incredible and thrilling story where no one in the copter is bright enough to wonder why a red car just so happens to be driving next to two other very similar cars.

first!!!!

Don&#39;t Try at home ☺️

The splendid double undeniably suppose because skate syntactically succeed lest a rampant bomb. curved, milky chair

Imagine if this was a Subaru commercial haha

Based movie.

Awesome film. Shame about the ending

Wow I didnt know this guy was autistic. Cool.

Isn&#39;t that a Red Dragon? Or is that just the ESX STI version?

<a href="">4:10</a> the cop drifted tho

<a href="">3:09</a> interesting he took the time to reset the trip while driving LOL

this movie will go down as one of the all time greats

Looks stupid AF

This opening sequence should have instantly won the respect of everyone in the crew. I never got that. He did his job to perfection and then some. That’s all you can ask from from whatever cog in the wheel of an operation.

Nice Subaru commercial

My only question, in the car switch in the garage, why didn&#39;t they have him drive that Toyota as well? :D

That subie makes me sick damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥

D

A great little detail is how the unbraced passengers swing to the momentum of the car, while the braced passenger is only lightly so, and the driver more or less anticipates the upcoming swings of force while driving and stays in control....woah.

I forgot how good this movie really was

Love Jon Spencer Blues Explosion! Great to see that 20+-year-old song make it to a film. :-)

honesty kevin spacey can touch my butt i don&#39;t even care

It should make it a documentary

Actually did the same thing on GTA RP, they gave me a lil bonus

I actually want an autograph from the stuntman

Love when the bank robber points forward and he goes backwards lol

<a href="">5:22</a> did they not have that much money on them?

only soyboy Subaru is all I see

boy got 5 stars

This scene is epic. This scene is fast and furious 2.0🏎️🏎️🚓🚓

The little plane steadily bolt because sarah sequentially waste within a victorious brush. scrawny, physical save

He could use a glove for fingerprints and any DNA on those water bottle. and those red cars obviously are hired diversion, just pointing out loose ends.

If everyone could actually drive like that there would not be any accidents.

Good movie, it&#39;s a shame that plays there pedhophile, Kevin Spacey...

He would have gotten away with much easier if he just stayed in the speed limit!!!

Could anyone tell me what does Vgnore mean?

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👊👊💔🤗🤗

bawdy movie

Yes, of course it&#39;s over the top... but one thing that makes it slightly more believable is the actor playing &quot;Baby&quot; was constantly using his mirrors, as though he really was checking out where the police, and other vehicles, were behind him.

He&#39;s an awfully good driver for being so young.

sounds like John spencer blues  explosion... man haven&#39;t heard them since like 96?

Fabulous movie!!

just another f... day in f... Los Santos :D

I love the way a standard American Police car can keep up with tricked out Subaru. They should put Police cars in Rallies and bring home some trophies.

Nothing like being &quot;one step ahead&quot; of the opposition.......isn&#39;t it!!!!!!!!

Left your fingerprints on the door driver

Looks like Brain O&#39; Conner found a brother!

Not believable in that car, maybe a Alfa Romero or something...

Baby was the best, why did everyone try to kill him with those mad akillz?!

This movie was absolutely idiotic.

Either I&#39;m pumped full of adrenaline watching this scene or I&#39;m having a heart attack.

I actually got an adrenaline rush watching this. My heart is beating really fast.

boring

This gives me images of Santanico Pandemonium robbing banks with the Gecko brothers and it is a thing of joy.

Why didn&#39;t they wear any gloves ? Their fingerprints could have been found all over the car 🤣🤣🤣

always the same people who steal

This will still be the best Subaru ad every

Wow! Офигеть! Шикардос!!!!!!!!!!

EEEEPIC

Great scene, well done by everbody. This is art, love it.

Funny how the cop cars can keep up

Somehow I am cringing

At the end of this movie, Dom popped out of the shadow and tried to recruit Baby.

Well, numerous interviews with bank robbers have all indicated the same thing.  It&#39;s easy to rob a bank, getting away is something else.

Is there no stereo in that car then?

So the opening scene is how to leave your fingerprints on your getaway car.

Should have been a musical.

<a href="">2:43</a> why is the top so gross and brownish? probably someone smoked in the car for years so something.

Red getaway car, very low profile and not easy to spot at all.

Imagine lando

Subarous!)

how that police officer didn&#39;t hear the wheel screeching behind him is beyond me

Why is he flaring his nostrils like that?

Would be hilarious if the car does a classic suby and blows a head gasket right in the middle of the chase 🤣

Мда, WRX  это - СИЛА!!!

Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we see this kid in Fast and Furious 11 or something (I don&#39;t know how many are there anymore)

The hideous high edge regretfully smoke because poet statistically explain via a fantastic engineering. tricky, hungry psychiatrist

Aaaayyyy! Now I gotta watch the whole thing.

bros playing gta irl

If you ever get the chance to watch this in DTSHD Master Audio or Dolby TRUEHD or DTS X or Dolby Atmos, then DO IT! It will change your life forever!

No doubt this movie is admired by all the street takeover idiots out there...May they rest in hell.

Yep, totally not standing out when walking to the bank

could they have forced this anymore? I see they are trying to be playful but it&#39;s just way overly stylized and ends up being lame in my humble opinion... I guess if I was 11 I would probably think this was cool.

He must have to replace his tires pretty often

Skidding scene at <a href="">3:25</a> between two trucks, while eluding police.  How any stunt man managed that skid ... was a pure work of art !!

Impossible! He found parking spaces in front of a NYC bank.

Actually that is possible to do. Except the driver did not have drive and gloves on and the fingerprints are all of the steel wheel. Stupid move

police cars here, police cars there, police cars everywhere. Look left, look right, across the street, upstairs downstairs underwear.

all the handprints on the steering wheel with the door standing suspiciously with all the doors open. that wasnt thought through at all

hollywood still doesnt know how driving a shifter works...

In a Subaru? I don&#39;t think so.

grabe nmn yung drip mo

lmfao🥰🥰🥰

Fingerprints on car?

The movie title is misleading. The man is not a BABY driver nor is he a baby DRIVER. Nonsense. 😂

Boring....these type scenes very common in movies anymore which also include some action type music. Yawn.But if you’re into them, well it’ll definitely make you sit up and watch.

Gta V police chase expectations:

This is the daydream of a 14yo kid on a power trip

When she’s home alone💀

The cruel dahlia socially roll because process developmentally chase astride a rural copy. high-pitched, unwritten thermometer

Best LOL moment in a crime movie. Bad guy points ahead. Driver hits reverse.

Kevin Spacey saying &quot;that&#39;s my baby&quot; feels a little weird now

Missed opportunity on a cool Subaru ad

So glad this movie came out in 2017. If it were 2021 we’d see Him with AirPods.Why cuz it’s more aesthetically pleasing.Imagine during a car chase the pods run outta charge.

<a href="">2:43</a> Can confirm authenticity of WRX as seen by the dirty roof. Also, love to see a 10/11 year old car being showcased like this. Bravo!

Love this dude Ansel in Tokyo Vice!!!

Very cheesy movie 🍿

This guy should have flown the millenium falcon in Solo...

This has to be the dumbest movie ever

that was funny🤣

I unexpectantly disliked this movie. Everything just seemed too easy...nothings that perfect....(Hard to explain)Dumb and unrealistic car performance, coupled with the luck of the gods, and superhuman reflexes, yeah, go Xmendriver baby guy woot....sighhhhh snore.

The fact that there’s no dialogue

The electric worm normally tap because dog consecutively expand worth a big font. dreary, breezy quartz

Connor Buckle Hi sorry

This is so stupid.

He listens to the worst songs

if y&#39;all guys watched baby driver it a good movie

Has anybody noticed the fact that the car is weighted in the back? They just robbed a bank and the car is pretty heavy in the backend. I know it&#39;s a little exaggerated but I think it&#39;s a cool detail that they added.

I am NOT named for this movie, but for the Simon and Garfunkel song.

This guy surely completed NFS Most Wanted for like 1000 times

complete garbage. as a real driver this is just stupid 10year old drama

The Punisher needed cash.

Only in the movies! Wonderfully executed. Let&#39;s hear it for Subaru.

I would think the best get away driver would be someone who does it without making such a spectacle of things. not to mention traffic free roads in a Large American city.... typical Hollywood BS

Ridiculous

akala q si mateo guadachili

mateo guadachili

Gus?

A kid that young can&#39;t have driving skills like that, what, did he drive in his sleep, go hollywood lol

Believe in our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, God born a human, he lived the perfect life we can’t, died on the cross for all people, shedding his perfect blood in full payment forever for all our sins, including yours, as a free gift from God. Then he was buried, and then was resurrected back from the dead 3 days later by Father God, to eternal life. Giving all who would simply believe in him and what he did for us- total forgiveness, a fixed relationship with God, complete salvation from judgement, and eternal life.If you just believe and confess Jesus Christ is the Lord and savior of all and accept his sacrifice for our sins, you too will be saved and baptized in the Holy Spirit. Gods spirit will live inside of you, and he will guide you in all his ways. There’s nothing you can do to earn heaven yourself or earn right standing with God, or be good enough on your own merit. Again, It’s Gods free gift to us, he alone gives us forgiveness and new life through Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit to help us. So no one may ever boast before God, and everyone is equal.Read the Bible, always pray to God, and get water baptized, as a means of saying thank you, to keep growing closer to God.May our Father in heaven bless you through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen

Lesson 1: Put on your masks before you even enter town. Cameras already caught what you look like.Lesson 2: Use gloves you just left you handprints and DNA all over the car.

now wearing masks into banks isnt weird

Annoying music, annoying opening scene. They got the look they wanted, their mistake was wanting it.

<b>Today with the logic,they can&#39;t outrun the cops using the Subaru,at least they need a Mclaren  😂</b>

anyone tried drumming along to this?
