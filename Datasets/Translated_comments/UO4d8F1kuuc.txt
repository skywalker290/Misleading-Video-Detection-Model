Omfg of course they got there fukon the scene in the first movies isn&#39;t fake they really did that I got a feel they fkd on set actors go all out with sex scenes they only use so much but yeah there is word Michelle Rodriguez was a pornstar and porn tube took down the vid over a decade ago

Rip paul walker

talking about Paul&#39;s tragic death and seeing the clip of Tyrese crying, I lost it also, I began to cry too :&#39;(

Is it just me or did everyone think Letty Name Was Lenny.

You mean his 19 y/o daughter has a 16 y/o stepmom??

They&#39;re actors.

Please get this msg out... Vin Diesel needs to make one last Fast and furious movie ... Make all about racing and get everyone who is still alive racing against each other, Bad guys good guys/girls etc get them all together one last time, just racing even for pink slips and do it all at &quot;Race Wars&quot;... No action stunts, No saving the world crap, no BS just racing for fun :) - heck I&#39;d see it.

<a href="">2:32</a> Sagittarius is always unlucky in love.

<a href="">6:19</a> thanks god I look twice, triple actually. At first I thought that man was pull the shirt..like you know  what I mean

Hobbs and Shaw would technically be number nine Fast and Furious 9 will technically be a fast and furious 10 so call me at 9 with this be a precursor the Hobbs and Shaw was not even a technically a fast and furious movie if a total of 10 Fast and Furious movies is that mean that there&#39;s not going to be number 11 does that mean there&#39;s not going to be number 12 well little No doc

I wish we could&#39;ve seen Giselle and han because I was starting to like that couple too.

Hot  Michelle
Are u kidding me  .... this video is nothing I expected 

I think we have have winner at the end

<a href="">2:08</a> Look at Paul’s smile   
I Love Paul Walker

I am looking forward to watching FF9 when it comes out on DVD. Fans will never forget Paul Walker R.I.P.

As Paul Walker said &quot;if the speed kills me don&#39;t be sad because I was smiling&quot;

So are we just going to disregard the fact that Paul was going out with a 16 year old when he was 33?

Wait... how tf is Vin the grandfather of paul&#39;s daughter?

I&#39;m so hate braga&#39;s face
Damn zac effron

Thats Ruby Rose in the picture with him at <a href="">1:27</a> though, maybe you were just showing that pic randomly, but its confusing when shown especially when you&#39;re talking and showing pictures of him and his actual wife and then that photo comes up in the mix

Beautiful  fam️
Yes look beautiful been partners

We love it 

Han is alive.

All vin diesel&#39;s wifes are smaler than him.

This franchise was packed with so much gorgeousness I could barely breath watching the movies.

you can kiss my ass!!!!
Paul actually had a crush on Jordana around the time of the first film

K

Han is alive!

Gisele could still be alive

Could gisele be añove
What therock says is totally true!

I know I miss Paul walker !!!

So the rock and his wife split up in 2012? But hes spent more than a decade with Lauren Hashian? I am confusion

lol shocking

R.I.P Paul Walker 

I watched him when he was a small boy on Highway to heaven with Micheal Landon

I thought hans surname is Han Seoul-Oh

No way she’s married to Thor she’s lucky

did he just say 16 Yo jasmin

The world hates R. Kelly, but glorifies Paul Walker? Just another example of white privilege!smh

loldom and letty (ok they are couple in series)Mia and Brian (same couple)Han and Giselle (Couple)Roman (Single)Tej (Single)Deckard Shaw and Hobbs (that doesn&#39;t seem good) 

His wife look like meshelle rodriguez,

anyone notice ruby rose with vin as his &quot;partner&quot;

Okay I am a big fan of the franchise and have seen every movie, me and my fiancé also watched Paul outside of the movies witnessing his charity and what not. However both me and my husband had our jaws on the floor when he said a 16 year old girl (a minor) fell in love with Paul at the age of 33, and the narrator didn’t miss a beat or stop the video to explain this whatsoever he just kept on talking as if a child at the age of 16 being romantically involved with a 33 year old man and that man was in a relationship with her 7 years  (he would be 40 she would be 23) and she took on being a mother easily to his children!!!!!! IS THIS REAL LIFE RIGHT NOW? This isn’t normal or okay for any one to do. Make or female if you have relations with a minor you get arrested! If this is true of Paul walker (which  I seriously doubt this information now btw) he should not be so highly regarded and memorialized. Instead he should be forgotten like any other person who would hurt a child. And yes I mean hurt because at 16 which of any of us honestly knew what love was hell most don’t know what it is at 33 and some never figure it out. So if you believe this behavior is okay your just as guilty as the person that does the actual deed and the LORD  says “any that would harm a child, it would be better that they had not been born, than to face my fathers judgement for doing so” I didn’t quite the actual King James Bible there I just gave the easy Marie’s down to earth English translation ..... I got some research to do on Mr Walker so I’ll not judge just yet let me go get fact or fiction verdict on this mess....

Best movie ever
There is no such thing as a “Porsche GT” what you meant to say is Carrera GT. Had to point that out, car nerd here 

but han doesnt dieeeee
<a href="">4:31</a> check the comments , And RIp Paul &lt;3

Vin Diesel really did named his child after Paul Walker,  just like what he did in F8. Wow!

We need Paul in f9

Why is no one talking about how Paul was 33 when he started dating his girlfriend who was 16???

And still hot

A 16yr old dating a 33yr old? And no one thinks it&#39;s strange or gross?

Paul )))):

I wish dom and lenny were still together they would be a good couple

Vin Diesel a tuff guy? Common man,no one saw the video were Vin sings and dances in his apartment to Beyoncé and Taylor Swift??

Wait Paul walker dated a 16 year old, Paul walker is like a modern day Michel Jackson

Bro for so long I thought they all were dating in real life till I started to mature heartbreaking moment

Wait, Tej is a Mechatronics Engineer? Bruh, come teach me this syllabus: I&#39;m super confused!

Dominique??? <a href="">0:53</a>
Fast and FURIOUS.... XOXOXO

Paul walker we miss you  forever in our hearts 

Why does Dwayne&#39;s posts look like he&#39;s the one who gave birth to his kids though? 

Paul Walker unfortunately never married. He would’ve made a wonderful husband. RIP

Translate into Russian, please
Paul Walker didn&#39;t die in an &quot;accident&quot;,he was killed by the Illuminati, his car was destroyed by a drone strike

Ahhh im damn waiting for FF9 to explain how the heck Han is still alive 

Hello? You missed the hacker Ramsey? She&#39;s been around for 2 movies now...

Isint vin gay
Michelle Rodriguez back in the day on Howard Stern said they dated for a short time but it wasn&#39;t serious.

Jasmine 16 year old, wow,

RIP Paul walker

And today Han is alive

What&#39;s that stupid fool gonna do when she gains 10 pounds of babyfat kick her to the curb cause that fucker don&#39;t like thick women it was funny when the Rock slapped that shiny black bald head of stupid tyrese

Wait what paul was 33 dating a 16 year old wtf?

It&#39;s nice to know these people have a great life in real life. AKA Gisele and Elena having great families despite their &quot;death&quot; in the movie. That also means for Paul Walker/ Brian in the other way. RIP

Are You CBR?
<a href="">2:40</a> I didnt know that shes lesbian

God took care of Brian O’Connor sin sleeping with a 16-year-old girl . I don’t feel sorry for his death anymore.

So Walker was 33 dating a 16 year old = petofile

RIP Paul 

I miss Paul

And me here be like &quot;Racers don&#39;t need girls.&quot; Sob

R.I.P Paul Walker ️
vin diesel is 51? omg
I thought Vin Diesel was gay? Boy was I wrong. Been listening to fake news I guess. Not that I care. Bad ass either way.

again it is just blah blah blah blah blah blah boring
Hon isent dead anymore

you mean Palestinian and the Palestine Deseret

So Paul walker was a Charlie Chester?

  holds your attention to the end  <a href="">1:44</a>    
Always remember Paul when seen this <a href="">0:21</a>

I wonder if Paul Walker pissed on Jasmine like R. Kelley did to a 16 year old?

Jason Statham landed a sexy duo

Very cool, I'm a fan of everyone 
Paul having sex w a sophmore in high school maybe if he was arrested he still be alive

Why was there a picture of Vin Diesel and Ruby Rose ? 

Han is coming back

Vin diesel been married to a hot latina
Paul&#39;s death was tragic but we are praising the fact this grown as man was smashing a 16  year old who was playing stepmom to a girl that was older then her.....

16

So the actors r allowed to marry older women or men and younger women or men and v aren&#39;t

Did anybody else miss the fact that Paul Walker&#39;s girlfriend was 16 and he was 33 when they started dating??? Ummm, are we just going to slide by the 18 year difference of these two? I mean, last time i checked, in California, females had to be 18 years of age to have a legal relationship. I&#39;m just saying...folk were all mad about R. Kelly and his &quot;dating&quot; preferences. Love you in your grave Paul...I was just sayin.

<a href="">1:26</a> I thought that was Ruby Rose

The fast and furious movies are so awesome 

Anyone else here from watching fast 9 trailer?

Paul’s girlfriend was born in 1989.

Paul died in 2015 stupid

Your narrative is so annoying.

Who cares???

<a href="">1:27</a> that ruby rose

I’m sorry but the rock wife looks like a witch

Paul&#39;s not dead , he&#39;s just waiting for us at the finish line

just want to say that at the  age  of  16 you are  allowed to  go  to  war  with the parents  permission of course,so i don&#39;t understand why people keep seeing teenagers are  children???  There not. And  it  doesn&#39;t mean they have sex. The police even catched teenagers who were actually watching child pornography and have been punished as such. So why  a teenager is  a kid again???

5 ads, really?

Michelle is a slag

U said 16 year old girl

<a href="">1:48</a> 

Ha. Hans alive
Gyo paul walker dated a 16 year old at the age of 33 tell me I didn&#39;t hear that correctly n how n the world does the narrator says it so casually

I don&#39;t know how much Vin Diesel paid these people to advertise that he likes. This girl? Vin Diesel does not like women. He likes the sausage. .

Han is alive in fast and furious 10

Turns out haan bamboozled us
Teenage and 20s women salivating over 40+ actors then when a real 40+ year old man comes long... ewwww you’re so OLD you could be my father...

<a href="">2:40</a> I love how she’s literally dated only women and Zac Efron (apart from the genderfluid Cara Delevigne)

So Paul walker is a chomo and gets all this love wtf

<a href="">1:26</a> - my dudes The girl in the pic Isn’t his “gf”ITS RUBY ROSE get ya facts right

Not surprised about Chris Hemsworth especially when one have &quot;RUSH&quot; in mind,..i was scared he might be the real life &quot;James Hunt&quot; when i saw him dancing,...The women are so beautiful,..and the men are so &quot;RICH&quot; that is consistent,..if you got &quot;bucks&quot; they will get pregnant as many times as you want

Han is back in 9!!! Gizzel should be back to!

Vin diesel that photo is ruby rose btw

It was crazy how Paul died in a car but it’s kinda weird, live for the car die in a car

I hate couples that have big age differences.Also, I hate any bisexual, homosexual couples

I m happy for everyone but still miss Paul. And every time I see his face makes me cry. I dnt know why.Its a long way, without u my friend, I&#39;ll tell u all about this when I see you again. I&#39;ll see u again.. Ohoo hooooooo..

I love Paul Walker as a person and a Actor, but dating a 16 yr old when your 33 yrs old, is definitely not right. Too young for me, but respect to Paul and the fact that he passed away. God Bless  SMH

Han is still Alive in Fast 9.

The car was Paul Walker’s he had just bought the car and had never driven it until the day he died which his accountant was driving at the time which wasn’t very smart especially going way over the speed limit they have speed limits for a reason and the public roads are not a race track so they weren’t using common sense they were breaking the law and being stupid and they could have killed someone by doing that

Which Film scene is it from @ <a href="">2:40</a>. Please tell me.

So Michelle Rodríguez is lesbian i don&#39;t give a s***  she is still  badass also i still  Miss Paul Walker i can see him driving on the Heaven Road rest in peace friend

Is Michele bisexual or zoophilia??seriously???Idih....
<a href="">4:59</a> well... We didn&#39;t now...
Han is not deadddddddddd

Ludacris&#39; wife is wonderful.. Just sayin&#39;.

Say hello to my little friend!! The funny trailer of Doolittle 

you lost me at <a href="">1:18</a>, Michelle Rodriguez actually said it in a video she posted on here instagram a while back.

So Paul walker was a pedophile?

Terese;s wife. Wow!

Some people cherish the lil things in life , some people don&#39;t, its gimme gimme things or i become a nitemare...

Elsa is very lucky 2b married 2 Chris ...

Who are you married to?

This is why I am in mess. Like always !

R.i.p poAnd I alker

1. Yes Jasmin 16 years old Paul 33 years old - she was too young, this case puts him in a bad light.

2. Paul and Jasmine were together 5 years and not 7 years !!! - Paul said in one of the last interviews that he is single for two years and he is not going to change it for now because since Meadow who lives with him wants to devote himself completely to her as a father. In turn, one of his best friends confessed in an interview that they broke up because Jasmine and her family pressed him too much for marriage and he did not want to marry her, she dumped him, YES - she broke up with him!

3. The lack of reliable information and the fact that she was with him for 7 years until his accident is annoying. And then such false information goes into the world.

Okay to clear up everything guys, yes the girl was 16, paul was 33. He started dating her but they didn&#39;t do anything sexual until she was 18. He met her in a different country so the laws were different there. Also in some states 16 is the legal age. So I don&#39;t think his motives were pedophilia in any way, but I didn&#39;t know him in person so I can&#39;t say that 100%. Point is he didn&#39;t do it illegally. As for me, well... I could never date a 16 year old because I&#39;m 25. I can&#39;t even date an 18 year old. I prefer woman my age or a bit older at times. I just think ages from 16 - 20 are mostly childish and I would feel very wrong, nor am I even attracted to younger girls. So to be honest, I don&#39;t know how some men do it, but I guess to each there own. I can&#39;t lie when I say I do feel a little off about him dating such a young girl, but let&#39;s leave it to god to judge him and let&#39;s not throw any stones to the dead. A quote you guys should live by is &quot;You should not fear the dead, for the living can do much more harm than a ghost with no skin&quot;. He&#39;s dead now, so whatever business he had on earth cannot be dealt on this planet but only in the realm of the afterlife.

Did he say &quot;domenique&quot;

<a href="">10:55</a> they look like thor

<a href="">6:20</a> i found my people comented on her Instagram +62

Miss you paul

you said every couple on screen and then you said their real life partners. and when you said luke hobbs and deckerd shaw, i was like: wait wait wait!!!! did i miss something???? XDdddd

we all miss paul walker very much

All I can say and I&#39;ll make it short and sweet: Great Video

i love you Michelle,just an angel,love will come when you least expect it,love uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
The whole 16 year old thing threw me off with him ..wtf

<a href="">2:17</a> Seriously.. What is wrong with guys???  muhamdasrl: &quot;I Love You&quot; &quot;I am in love with you&quot;...  Guys see a pretty girl online and their first comments tend to be &quot;marry me&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m in love with you&quot;...   Don&#39;t ever bother talking to, courting, dating, or getting to know someone... Just jump straight to &#39;marry me&#39;... Are you afraid the girl will learn how much of a DB you are if you talk to or date her???

Whoopie ding dong

oh my marbles, a 16 year old. R.I.P Paul.

paul walker was 30 and his girl was 16... and they had been together for 7 years... that dont sound right

Somewhere in December.....I really REALLY hope its the 6th of December cuz that&#39;s my birthday

Awesome bond they all had together but i can see why Paul was such an amazing guy good looks amazing attitude

How old were the characters in the first movie

Nothing about paul walker ?

Did he just said 16 years old ?

What close friend... Paul Walker? I don’t think so. We know for sure they weren’t close.

Paul Walker dated a 16 year old. This is legal depending on the State. ex Washington it’s legal, California it is illegal.

did he onistly say paul who was 33 was dating jasim who he says is 16?

Anyone else notice that the water picture of Vin Diesel and his “girlfriend” is actually a picture of him and Ruby Rose?

Dom and Letty are my favorite characters I watched every single one of the Fast and Furious movie and they are the cutest couple in the movie

PEDOPHILIA!! ...seriously tho that’s what it was. .   If this comment makes you upset you need to get a grip on your fandom issues, and get your moral priorities in check.

Pardon me 16???

Paul Walker was another R Kelly

Paul was gay? 

16 and 33? Where’s Chris Hansen??

My birthday is also Sept 11th i had no idea he is missed

It&#39;s nice that this was published on Sept 11th Paul Walker&#39;s birthday...and mine. R.I.P

Rose Huntington Whiteley  is my distant cousin.

This dude just said 16 year old Jasmine fell in love with Paul Walker who was 35, they were in love for 7 years, please tell me I heard that extremely wrong

Rest in peace

It has been so long since Paul Walker died and I&#39;m still way too sad about it. Rest In Piece, Paul.

Yo who wrote the fn description? They have a stroke ?

Fast 9 is coming out next year, May.

The good story and best

Great!! Love it!!

“Paul wander”

I stopped watching fast and furious when Paul Walker and his friend died in a Porsche carrerra 911 since that my heart was broken and couldn&#39;t bare to watch

It all started with tuna (no crust)

Lol when they think ruby is someone else

Umm, <a href="">3:36</a> Meadow Walker pic did anyone notice the creepy stalker comments!? That seriously scares me it&#39;s a step away from trying to possess her in real life 

Paul rest in peace

Paul you will be missed you had the most beatiful soul and smile....

Atleast Paul was smiling

Paul had the most beautiful smile and soul. It’s so heartbreaking that he’s gone. Rest In Peace &amp; Love 

Now why tf did Paul walker fuck with a 17 year old when he was 33? I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a bad person for it because he loved her very much. Had a 7 year relationship and marriage but it looks but from the outside you know?

If paul drives the car.accident dont take place rip paul u are my best hero

Roman pierce had a “girlfriend” at the end of fast five when he gets a koenigsegg

Wait... Paul was 33 dating a 16 yr old? Tf

Why do singers date singers actors dating actress and not like us that don&#39;t sing or act

All actors r puppets if they don&#39;t do what  u know who says there gone it&#39;s a big joke Hollywierd

They make it look like there all so happy really not

I had a feeling  she was gay

The memory of Paul with never die even if he is we will never forget

be careful of fraud

Fast and Furius 2real lite character!️
Who needs Van Diesel when u have Chris Harmsworth in real life...

Thumbnail is too funny

paul walker was with a 16 yo?, did they subtly throw that in as if it were ok ..

<a href="">7:51</a> why is your instagram in indonesia language

I&#39;m jealous to Thor&#39;s wife  they&#39;ve been married for 7 yrs? wow! such an amazing couple.

Video could have possibly been less that 4 mins

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker didn&#39;t like each other

Dont drive fast you will get bald. Just imagine all the fast furious 7

If Paul walker was black he would be a pedophile and have to register as a sex offender and get blasted by social media like R Kelly but since he&#39;s white it&#39;s all right gtfo

Epic movie serious-new hobbs  can wait till red box

Paul didn’t die
So what did we learn today  Dont drive a Porsche

Paul will always be missed

Wow is no-one going to say it Paul Walker was a peodaphile he was 33 she was 16 

This guy is pronouncing names wrong

What about the 2 latinos who blew up the toilets in Fast and Furious 5?

Rip Paul Walker.  You brought light into this world and are missed.

Did not believe them as a couple on fast and furious

I LOVE MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ

Amazing actors with amazing lives to match!! Great video I love the movie franchise!!!

Heard Paul Walker is still hot

33 yr old Paul Walker dates a 16 yr old, and no one cares; R.Kelly does it and the metoo movement is on his ass. If that ain&#39;t white privilege, I don&#39;t know what is

As a 33 year old dating a 16 year old... wtf Paul doing jailbait.

Damn Michelle she beautyfull.

I always thought vin was gay......

Is it just me? I heard The Rock voice while listening to his quote.

I thought Michelle Rodriguez was a lesbian... But she&#39;s bi... That means I have a chance now...

I don&#39;t mind to have her even if she&#39;s lesbian 

HELLO viewer am here to share my testimony on how I finally join the Illuminati hood and became RICH,FAMOUS AND POWERFUL, I tried all my possible best to become a member of the hood but I was scam several times, before I finally come across a testimony on net so I contacted the agent, I was so afraid that he will ask me for lot of money before I can join the hood but to my greatest surprise he only ask me to obtain the membership form which I did and today am so happy to say to the world that am one of the richest by having the sum of $360 millions dollars in my personal account as a new member and am also known all over the world with the business given to me by the Illuminati and also have power to do that which I want...... I know so many people may be on my lane also looking for help here is their official COUNCIL EMAIL ADDRESS (contactilluminatimp@gmail.com)_or whatsapp my helper on Whats-app  +442033895632.YOU MUST BE ABOVE THE AGE OF 18YRS...

Nail 51?

Very good content. Great script! Great video!

I thought Brian&#39;s mom married Thor

<a href="">1:25</a> that´s Not Paloma, It´s Ruby Rose. Look at colour of their eyes. Paloma Has brown eyes, Ruby blue.

That isnt ruby rose?

Man I miss Paul so much 
Bruh why Walker dated a 16 yr old wen he was 33 I love that nigga since the 1st FF it&#39;s so hard to respect him for that but wherever he at hope he regretted it  shiit weird 

Paul walker was dating a 16 year old I’m confused?

Wait did u say he fell in love with a 16 yr old wtf?

RIP PAUL WALKER ️️
How does one get divorced in 2012 and then been with his new woman for almost a decade........... 

Michelle belongs with a man not woman

Why women love women why why why!!!!!!

The video is well executed a lot sensitivety also and I think you know how to tell someone&#39;s story the background music the tone of your voice adjusts when you&#39;re talking about a sensitive issue well done man thumbs up 

Yeh wow didn&#39;t know he&#39;s knew gf was 16 abit youg to be dating a 33 year old

Wtf did they say he&#39;s new gf was 16 at the time and he was 33 huh ??

<a href="">1:26</a> lol diff person
I&#39;m not surprise she&#39;s gay

boring!!!!!!!

RIP Paul Walker

The best movie ever, better than the simpsons!

Who couldn&#39;t guess letty was gay??

Wines 51?!?!
I think large age gap is good knowing that western women don&#39;t age well especially after giving birth..

<a href="">4:29</a> really no one noticed anything odd about that picture??

Holy shit .. I thought Vin is 40s .. 
What else do you want to know about Fast &amp; Furious?

This is probably the most no this is in fact the best voice over video in YouTube history thank you for this video

Bisexuality isn’t real ‍️
Why vin diesel dresses like a 15 year old doe.

She started liking Paul when she was 16. People don’t realize that they probably didn’t start doing anything till she was way older

Wait Paul walker dated a girl that was 16 when he was 33 and everyone is ok with that?

It Paul walker not Paul wonder

It’s always the hot ones that are gay... such a waste

R.I.P Paul
R.I.P. Paul Walker but god dammit...

The fact that they put Hobbs and Shaw like as if they dated. They know tumblr has shipped them 

Charlize Theron?

<b>*cough cough*</b> their bringing Mia back in the upcoming fast and furious

Did u forgot jhonny strong?
It&#39;s not possible to be bi an have a relationship unless its a 3 people relationship an that isn&#39;t normal so just have sex with different people if u bi an that&#39;s what they do. Spread your aids an herpes

talking about Paul&#39;s tragic death and seeing the clip of Tyrese crying, I lost it also, I began to cry too :&#39;(

People need to realize that the age of consent in California is 16 so it is perfectly legal that they were dating.

Who doesn&#39;t love fast and furious 0

Hahaha everyone’s so shocked about a 33 year old dating a 16 year old! Calm down people it’s just a few years apart...OHH WAIT DAMN the age difference is older then her  but each to their own it made him happy and hope he rip.

The love and bonds between the franchise is incredible

Wow!!!!!!! 16yr old is that true???

I was waiting for Vin Diesel&#39;s  boyfriend.

U are lie

fucking people do anything for money

33 year old paul had a relationship with a 16 year old This breaks my heart more

But michel from f f said she liked men and enjoyed eating women i know all about lesbians and women who live with other women  as man and wife its another story  and still are getting sex from men thats another story why get married once a woman screws a million different people she might as well screw million one

I understand
So are we not gonna address that this man dated a 16 year old but we got people out here getting their legacies tarnished for the dating minors, that&#39;s just sick.

hol up did you say 16 year kid jasmine fell in love with paul

Ugh he dated a 16 year old wtf never knew that... 

<a href="">1:26</a> that&#39;s Ruby Rose

Ruby rose with vin bahahawrong pic

Years go by so quickly , I&#39;m glad most of the cast has found there awesome lovers n very happy ...

Watching some great cars around while our favourite actors and actresses get filmed, it&#39;s common man.

Why don&#39;t you not add Brian in there, Let&#39;s look forward not be sad

So that&#39;s why Mia and Paul weren&#39;t kissing in the latest fast and furious, because the director was dating mia(forget the real name)

Fast and furious should continue to cast Elena she&#39;s a good actor

<a href="">4:29</a> why is he touching her pussy? No, no, no, bad boy

Being a grown up man and dating a non adult is not right <a href="">#rippaul</a>

lol, so a 33 year old (Paul Walker) together with a 16 year old Girl... ... Hollywood will never change.

second picture of vin and his &quot;GF&quot; is actullay Ruby Rose and not Paloma Jiménez

What paul walker was 33 with an 16 year old????

If Paul let Roger drives a GTR,he probably still here

Spoiler alert..

Michelle is lessbin

Vin and Michelle were actually dating off screen during the filming of The Fast and the Furious part 1

He lost me when he said Vin Diesel was handsome. Also, he acts like there was real chemistry between Diesel and Rodriguez on the big screen. Oof.

Uh dude its han seolo not han lue

good vid
