Nacho goal against Portugal left the chat

The disgrace towards di Maria goal ...

Ronaldo has left the chat 😢
Why without Nacho from Spain?? His insane goal also well deserved in tournament with Portugal

Yes

Hello FIFA, why aren&#39;t you making TOP 10 GOALS anymore. I wanted to watch top 10 goals for 2022 World Cup.

Di maria&#39;s goal vs france in the 2018 world cup is so underrated

-

I would add Di Maria to this list, he also scored a super goal against France

Ronaldo free kick?
World cup 2014 😈☠️😈
Even in 2024 everytime I watch this it brings me back the memories☹️😭💯❤️

Felipe Coutinho was missing
Di Maria vs France?
Now we need to wait 4 years for next wc video💀

HOW BLIND YOU&#39;RE FIFA!You gave puskas to Salah goalTotally unfair ❗

Calling all soccer lovers! Visit us now for non-stop football thrills on my channel. ⚽🔥

This top does not include Nacho's goal against Portugal
i’m sorry fifa but this list is terrible. where is di maria vs france and nacho vs portugal???

Di Maria's against France should have been the 2nd best goal
numner 3 and 1 the best

What about Ronaldo

#7 is overrated and it was only there because it was a game winner

i like pasta
Extraordinary
Quintero's goal is the first and so far the only free kick goal from below the barrier in World Cups, it completely deceived the barrier and the goalkeeper, and the effect that that ball takes can only be done by a magician like him.
Not nacho?
BonusKolarov Vs Costa RicaNacho Vs PortugalCoutinho Vs SwitzerlandThe other 3 Goals of CheryshevCosta Vs Portugal (1-1)Suarez Vs Russia Free KickInui Vs Belgium

Di Maria&#39;s goal against France in RO16 should be there.

What is the name of this background music ?

Of course Quaresma scored a trivela goal hahaha

messi better goal then quaresma and others... what

Where is Ronaldo`s free kick againts Spain

The fact that Perišić&#39;s goal vs England is not on this list is asinine

I dont know Why I get emotional of this video🥲

Nacho vs Portugal?
<a href="">4:38</a> ?? This is a really great goal😮😮
7th place: Why is it so good to get hit twice in a row when Lukaku drops the ball during Chadli's goal scene?
Son vs Mexico goal&gt;
Dd

Nacho vs Portugal???
Think for a moment that Colombia was nothing short of once again being the team with the best goal in the World Cup for the second consecutive time.
What about do marias goal😢
i think Quaresmas goal is better then ahmet musas goal

Isn't there a volley of nacho in it?
Di maria&#39;s goal was the second best goal

There’s no way Cavani’s goal against Portugal couldn’t find its way to the top 10 list. It was so perfectly timed with amazing technique. Great goal!That deserves a place here 🤍🤍

What’s the name of this audio music beat

The moment when Japan was knocked out by Belgium atvthe very last second was just unbelievable.

The Goal of Kroos is just incredible. How can a player dare do this at the very last second 🤩😂Awesome

Where Di MARIA&#39;S goal

Di-Di Maria??
A World Cup in which they did not steal 🫢
And Dimaria's goal against France
What&#39;s the soundtrack name?

<a href="">2:12</a> Watch this goal with Turkish commentator Levent Özçelik&#39;s commentary.

DI MARIA GOAL  AGINST FRANCE...

It&#39;s so sad Kozlov&#39;s goal was left out...You rarely see those types of goals in Serbia.

The UZB flag was seen in the frame where the 1st goal was scored at 0:21 min 😮
Bavard

This goal from Pavard from France was unique, you can't help but feel the emotion of football watching it
Where is Di Maria&#39;s goal against France?

me poland hi

Dimaria vs france?
And Nacho's goal?
It is a lack of respect that di Maria's goal against France is not there
Kroos, His free kick was last chance on the match. People who came from Germany expected his pass though he hit a shot! That&#39;s a incredibly!

where is 2022 world cup

Di Maria vs France??
How come Nacho Fernandez’ goal wasn’t here?

What a goal by Pavard

Say Maria???
Kroos Modric and Cristiano goals🔥

I only liked kroos free kick

QUARESMA 🇵🇹🖤🤍
Oh my god how many years have passed
Wait what does Quintero Hai do?

QUARESMA ONE MUST BE 2ND

why pavard don&#39;t won puskas award 😔

The most underrated team in the world cup was Russia what a team

Goal of dimaria vs France where ??

nice

Did u forgot nacho volley against spain?
portugal-Spain      goal Nacho
FIFA should make 1 for the 2022 world cup right? :)

Should have included Di Maria&#39;s goal against France...

The whole world not let the russia take part in wc qatarWts their fault u mfs

<a href="">4:28</a> why did Pavard look different to how he did in the match against Argentina?

Angel Di Maria’s goal against France should’ve been in this too

<a href="">3:14</a> 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Kolarov&#39;s goal vs Costa Rica should be here

Still waiting for 2022 top10 goals!

That stepover was the most useful thing Lukaku has done in his career

Is fifa🎉
Oh

What about Cavani Suarez's one-two against Portugal?
Juan is brother of Ederson

But the dimaria one?

This is best goals in the FiFa world cup

France!

how is de bruyne´s goal not in this

Di Maria vs France??
in marias goal???
Salah shoots better
Chat is song?

Where is the Dmaria goal? 😢

Coutinho's great goal is missing
One of the finest goals in football history is the goal of Benjamin Pavard and also Cristiano Ronaldo&#39;s terrific goal against spain

the background music name ?

Also Dani carvajal scored a very nice goal against portugal

Messi's goal wasta 😂😂
France vs Argentina Di maria?

2026 world cup champion france
Coutinho??

hay
The counter from Belgium

Lozano’s goal had to go on the top 😢 cause he evaded 3 defenders with a touch

Never gets old

thinking back how tf did nacho not make the list

takashi inui...
That messi touch was out standing

100

Quaresma and Cheryshev are underrated
2022 piz

And Nacho's😓
Chadli scoring an open net higher then Quaresma and Kross😂😂😂

does Maria play tennis?
dı marıa
Modric goal👌
Nacho goal vs portugal
Who&#39;s here after Argentina won the World Cup ❤

human is not human

Seriously, every goal is nice except Messis. Pretty standard goal. No nice finish, no super impressive assist. But I guess you need to include cause it&#39;s Messi even if it&#39;s nothing special

Phillipe Coutinho 😢

Honorable Mention: Chucky Lozano&#39;s goal against Germany. It&#39;s not the greatest goal, but the context and circumstancesances really make this a truly amazing goal.

How about  diego costa volley
Many comments rank Pavard goal the best, I don&#39;t agree. 4 year later when we reflect this world cup, it is clearly the Messi goal (No.5 in this video) is the best. Actually, FIFA rates that one the best in two decades.

Look at Griezmann reaction :)) <a href="">4:50</a>

Pov: Pavrad goals and Lucas assistBayern have them

Five years have already passed since the 2018 Russia World Cup was held. Nevertheless, the scores of the players featured in this video still seem to be great. I'm especially proud that Lionel Messi made it into the top 10 scoring videos despite his disappointing performance!
And Di Maria's against France??
going to report you to the police sir

Of Maria???!!!
Spain and portugal for me

Why was Pogba goal in the final not in this

Never understood why di Maria’s goal isn’t on here. Arguably top 2.

Hearth 😟😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
Ronaldo’s goal against Spain left the chat:

where is son??

<a href="">4:49</a> look at Griezmanns reaction to the goal

Ik its 4 years late but where is Trips’ free kick vs Croatia?

Nacho goal?
<a href="">3:14</a> 👀🥵
You know who&#39;s goal should be here, Nacho Fernandez&#39;s. But still PAVARD HOLY FU_

Pavard Goal 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Trippier&#39;s goal was far better than most of these

Unpopular opinion kolarovs freekick is better than ronaldos free kick its just here bc hes fhe goat

the best clip ever &lt;3

Nacho’s goal vs Portugal? Di Maria vs France?
Messi&#39;s goal deservers to be in  the top 3 no doubt...

SEGOND POTEAU PAVARDDDD

Why doesn&#39;t FIFA choose Asian players for every tournament?  Even though the Asians had some great goals, it&#39;s clearly racist.

Where is Di Maria&#39;s goal vs France?

Di Maria-Argentina VS FRANCE
This never gets old ❤️😊

Satisfied by pavard

Normal people talk about Parvard&#39;s goal.Legends talk about Ronaldo&#39;s free kick versus Spain. Gods talk about superb goals that aren&#39;t even mentioned in this video, such as Di Maria&#39;s goal vs France!

Of Mary in France??

Bro Messi&#39;s ball control!!! <a href="">2:57</a>

I love watching world cup football. It seems all the international footballers elevate their performance when they are playing for their country.

Waiting for the Top 10 goals in Qatar...

Quaresma´s goal had to be at least 6

Ima agree that Kolarov&#39;s Goal againts Costa Rica was cleary better than Ron&#39;s and Messi&#39;s one

Ok

where is angle de maria goal?

That of pavard is one of the best goals of the decade, outside the surface, the speed and force of strikes, the volley, the trajectory and the incredible effect of the ball , in the top corner, it crosses the defense, it's historic given the context and everyone will remember it for a long time
bruh how come fifa forget the goal by nacho against portugal

But Ronald scored that goal in the 2022 world cup not 2018

Benjamin Pavard is #1 🔥
Sweetest half volley of all time -Benjamin Pavard🔥

I already wrote a comment a year ago, and I will remember the World Cup as long as it is on this channel, now you are all against Russia, but then remember those times, if it weren’t for you, this World Cup simply wouldn’t have happened for 4 years...
Number 1 never gets old

Messi’s goal shouldn’t be at 5th. It’s just there because Messi scored it, otherwise better goals like Di Maria’s goal against France or Nacho’s goal against Portugal are missing

can&#39;t wait to see 2022 version

Ronaldo&#39;s goal against Spain was amazing

There should be di Maria goal Vs France 2018

Pavard modric cr7 messi kane. 2018 Was a Show of masterclass!!!

Benjamin pavard s&#39;goal so incredible💯💯💯💯💯💥👍👍👍👍👍
enneseyri&#39;s goal vs spain in 2018 is better than all these goals

Is Japan riding two on the designated side?
I can’t even believe that this happened not so long ago in Russia, especially in light of the latest pendostan isolation measures.
2022 Please

Who is waiting for this years (2022) top 10 GOALS video to come out

Lionel Messi 🐐December 20, 2022
Argentina vs France was the best final ever played

I give you a couple of goals that cannot be missed for the 2022 compilation, the ones that come to mind now: 1. The first from France England, from tchuameni (1-0)2. Lionel Messi's against Mexico (1-0)3. The second from Cameroon vs Serbia (3-2)4. The third of Serbia vs Cameroon (3-1)5. Mbappé's second goal in the final (2-2)6. Angel Di María's goal in the final (2-0)7. Iran's first goal vs Wales (1-0)8. Brazil's first goal vs Serbia (1-0)9. Julián Alvarez's first goal vs Croatia (2-0)10. Second goal from Japan against Spain (2-1) Sorry if the Argentinianity is very noticeable, I didn't start investigating, those are the first 10 goals that I remember right now haha. In fact, if they let me, I'll take out the one from Cameroon and put Enzo Fernández's great goal against Mexico as well (2-0)
Where is nacho goal

Top goals Cup 22 ?
Pavards goal was actually incredible

Nacho&#39;s goal?
Pavard's goal was anthemic
DRUGGED CRIMINALS ARE FAKE THIEVES DADS 💯💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💯💯💯
<a href="">4:51</a> that perspective is awesome. great work camera guy!

Kroos Free kick should be on top because saving your team and keeping hopes alive of the world cup at very last 95 min is a Father of all nerves control

Who else is waiting for FIFA to upload the top 10 goals of 2022? 😿
waiting the 2022 edition

cristiano ronaldo genius free kick
Who is here after messi won the world cup?

Di Maria&#39;s goal against France was a great one.

It's been 4 years since this World Cup, who would have thought it would go by so quickly...
Man I felt so bad for the Japanese goalkeeper there

&quot;FIFA World Cup 2022&quot;🇧🇭&quot;Argentina got cup with leader G.O.A.T MESSI🇦🇷🏆&quot;🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<a href="">4:28</a>  Messi come back and win fifa World cup 2022 Argentina 🇦🇷👏
where is goal of Phillipe Coutinho?

Nacho monreal vs Portugal??
Pavard&#39;s goal will never be the same

It is lovely to watch Messi&#39;s goal as now he just won player of the tournament 4 yrs later and the world cup

I still don't understand why Coutinho's goal isn't there
I don't make it through the world cup
Came back to watch this after the World Cup Final 2022. One of the Greatest World Cup Finals. Fought hard both France 🇫🇷 &amp; Argentina 🇦🇷 !

Hi from 2022!

FIRST! :)

no way musa  did an incredible job it deserved to be in top 5

Respect that level of awareness from Lukaku💯🙏

You should give Nacho goal vs Portugal in honorable mention

Maria's goal?
<a href="">4:51</a>-🥶
Di maria and nacho goal should have included in the list

No way Di Maria&#39;s goal wasn&#39;t mentioned

Who Will win Argentina or France

Personally, I think it's overwhelmingly Modric's.
Japan Vs Belgium 🙃 heartbroken counter attack I ever seen 😭
It&#39;s Argentina and France again this year.

Unforgettable
Why Di maria&#39;s goal against france is missing.? @fifa will you give me the answer?

Cheryshev's goal is much more beautiful and more difficult to execute than Messi's goal (coming next on top)
If Cristiano's goal was fourth, Luis Chavez's goal should be at least third in this World Cup. Great goal!
France world champion 2022
Anyone else notice the uncanny similarity between the music in this video and ‘The Business’ by Tiesto - which happened to be the song they played in the stadium before every 2022 World Cup match ??? 🤔🤔🤔

How many free kicks were scored at this World Cup

Perisic&#39;s goal to France in the final not being here is a criminality

Amazing and we are at again with Argentina Vs France final!

I can&#39;t understand that why is not here dimaria Goal

nacho fernnandez and di maria should&#39;ve been in this list!!!!

Nacho&#39;s goal against Portugal was 🔥

FRANCE WILL WIN AGAIN :)

Where is Di Maria&#39;s goal that scored to France

Nacho against Portugal?👀
<a href="">4:51</a> that camera angle was 10/10

#2 shouldn’t even be on here

nacho?
PAVARD SOBREVALORADISIMO

Where’s di Maria and nacho goal????

I don't believe that Quintero's goal this second haha, for me it's not a great goal, nor would I put it in the top, I think Nacho's goal against Portugal should be there, it looks a lot like Pavard's, and it's not even in the top.
Messi s goal number 5🙄🥴Nacho s goal vs Portugal not in the list🥴🥴👏
Where is the goal of Di Maria??

This year it's Richarlison for sure
Baba Messi's egg, his goal is nothing special
Pavard&#39;s goal is still the best goal of 2018

Pavard❤
Let&#39;s talk about what a legend can be CR7. I&#39;m too surprised to a free kick goal of Ronaldo 🇵🇹👑

Where&#39;s dimaria&#39;s goal against france?

Wish they played like dis in this years wc😒

me watching it in 2020 <a href="">0:24</a>

Instead of the goal number 2, i would prefer to see that of Di Maria against France. I think, Pavard&#39;s goal was a response to Angel&#39;s one

Pavards goal was simply delicious and never gets old for me. That ball trajectory 🔥🔥

Quintero is the reason defence now has a man to lie down behind the wall 😂

Ref. Portugal awarded free kickRonaldo: I call it Free Goal

Ty Quaresma for all goal in FIFA23

Congrats to this AFRIKAN-FRENCH football team fow win this world cup 2022 in Qatar

So far the most beautiful goal of the 2022 World Cup is from Richarlison
what a success  Benjamin Pavard, Number 1 scorer and world cup winner, I hope France will repeat the result that 2018😊

Di Maria&#39;s goal against France is missing

2018 was no Argentina’s year. They got scored on twice in the top ten goals

Mom Russia

Looking back at this, this still beats 2022 World Cup. Maybe I’m a nostalgia merchant but for all I’ve watched I still prefer them all over 2022

<a href="">3:42</a> now again in this 2022 WC, Argentina vs Croatie 🇭🇷 in semi finals 😅, I know Croatie can win, but at the same time Argentina can take its revenge, let’s see how it will be😅…

<a href="">1:14</a> the Nigerian goal was wonderful 😅

The last goal was simply glorious.

Iamdpress

i dont agree

Genius...Glorious
Super

CR7❤️🇵🇹
In terms of technology, United States is definitely number one in the world.
Where is the di maria&#39;s goal bro?

No vertonghen goal?
Pavard&#39;s goal is just perfect what a timing!

Pavard&#39;s goal was probably one of the best goals in the century, accurately kicked to hit the &quot;deuxième poteau&quot; with nearly impossible angle + it went so smooth. Astonishing!

of maria vs france???
Wait, Di Maria is missing there
Messi&#39;s goal sent Maradona into a frenzy that made him flip two middle fingers in celebration. 😂😂😂😂

Top 10 is 2014

Mbappe?

Didn&#39;t offside exist then?

Why is this music so nostalgic? So far, this World Cup was so much better than the current one.
Qatar&lt;Russia

Where is Di Maria&#39;s goal against France in RO 16 ??

What a goal, Benjamin !! The &quot;SECOND POTEAU PAVARD&quot; (second post Pavard !) of the french commentator will resound in me forever...

The World Cup should be held every year now. 

Every team has 1 chance to lose.

 If they lose, they fall to the Lower Bracket.

No need for group stages.

Di maria goal against france deserves to be in the list

Messi's goal is the best!!
Povar's goal is not the best.
TOP 1 GOALS  |  2022 FIFA WORLD CUP QATAR  =  JAPAN  VAR WINS

Nostalgia
Still perplexed as to how Nacho&#39;s goal was not in the top 10

Nachos vs Portugal Di Maria vs France
And you have excluded Cristiano Ronaldo&#39;s great freekick against top class spain that too when they were loosing. And he scored hattrick with that goal. What a cheap mentality FIFA has.

Di Maria's goal against France is missing
Where is di marias goal

I don't know where Qatar is going to get a top 10 that surpasses this, because I haven't seen goals so far similar to any of the ones that appear in this video from Russia 2018
In 21st second I saw to Uzbekistan&#39;s flag

Chadlis goal wasn’t great it was a tap in

Quaresma

What a crazy goal Pavard 👍
Toni Kroos&#39; goal should have been 1st

2022 top 1 is Richarlison&#39;s

What about di Maria’s goal vs France

This goal from Toni Kross, anyone who watched Luis Roberto's narration knows how exciting it was.
HOW is Di-Mariy🤔

The Messi goal IS a nice goal but he can stay in my top 10

suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
coutinho vs switzerland???
Indeed, Pavard's goal was the best goal of the 2018 World Cup.
talkative the best
Richarlison #1
i will never forget Belgium winning goal

Fantastic ❤️❤️❤️
Certainly the pigeon's goal will be in the top 10 video of 2022
Where are goals Di Maria, Coutinho?

di marias goal against france  deserves to be top 5

Pavard's goal is so big.
No way musa or Chadli are higher on the list than quaresma

It's incredible that Coutinho's goal isn't there!
Came here for pavard&#39;s goal

Ben-Pavard the name🔥

How did <a href="">4:07</a> get 2nd? I&#39;d have put in Di Maria&#39;s goal against France

Of Maria ? 😮
Lpm until today that we are in the middle of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Pavard's goal still hurts me
Give Pavard the Ballon d&#39;Or ☝️🐐

love football forever
Nacho&#39;s goal against Portugal??
The Day that He assembles you (all) for a Day of Assembly,- that will be a Day of mutual loss and gain (among you), and those who believe in Allah and work righteousness,- He will remove from them their ills, and He will admit them to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever: that will be the Supreme Achievement.(Tegabun 64/9)

&quot;To establish regular prayers and to fear Allah: for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together.&quot;(En&#39;am 6/72 )

Juan quintero was the best

They fr forgot about di marias goal

i&#39;ll never get tired of seeing modric&#39;s goal

Pavard all day long baby
<a href="">4:37</a> PAVAAARD OHHHHHHH

Nacho Fernández vs PortugalDiego Costa vs Portugal
Most of these are pretty normal goals tbh

Di Maria vs France ! I am french but it is a beatiful goal

Sensational!

Quaresma must be 3rd 4th place

Its everyone&#39;s dream to score a goal like pavards goal

Miss u miss u miss u fifa 2018 Russia
What is Messi's goal doing there? What a shame.
i don&#39;t think Quintero deserve the 2nd place

Missed those players who are missing in Qatar 🇶🇦2022

And that of Nacho Fernández and that of Di María??
pavard is very very coool

Quresma&#39;s Charisma... 👌
Given the time and situation, the Kroos goal should rank higher.

Quaressmaaa
nacho?
<a href="">4:19</a> when u have the biggest brain in the world🧠🧠🧠🤯🤯

Where is a NACHO&#39;s goal

That sublime Pavard goal.. the ball is constantly spinning and moves like it&#39;s going towards a magnet.. the angle of his body as he strikes the ball.. every other outfield player is running in a different direction.. and the cameraman got us the perfect view at <a href="">4:51</a>. And this coming from a player who&#39;s deployed to prevent goals rather than score them. Magical! Just Magical!

RUSSIA 2018 WORLD CUP - BEST OF THE BEST IN HISTORY!!!🇷🇺❤️⚽🏆👏🏻🥳
<a href="">4:22</a> :Also him: <a href="">4:11</a> 😂😂😂😂

Wow, its soooo breathtaking ----  I can&#39;t imagine how happy those who are watching live at Qatar💯👌👋👋👋🙌🙌🙌

Came here to compare Richarlison’s goal with Pavard’s goal , I really can’t tell which one is better

Quaresma’s is definitely no 1

but nachos?
