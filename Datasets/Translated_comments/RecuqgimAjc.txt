You missed so many scenes of King of romance Srk....

No ones does romance better then bollywood 

Yeh jawaani hai deewani is my all time favorite movie

Netflix 

Ranbir Deepika Yjhd,Tamasha

Brought in the big gun at the end

Srk

Count in, Malaal. Worth watching ️

Seeing the Masaan scene reminded me of the ring

i love SRK 

Last one&#39;s truly heart touching!!!!

I wish there was Yeh jawaani hai deewani in Germany

TAMASHA one is amazing, Imtiaz Ali is just superb

Jab we met has a different fanbase.

Imran ko bhul gye apa

Yjhd

Srk Was Enough to feature for this ... You dun need X Y Z Stars

I’m getting goosebumps ️

In most of Bollywood movies, Romance means harrassing and stalking girls until she says yes.

Omg

HOW CAN YOU GIVE A ROMANTIC VIDEO AND NOT ADD SRKAJOL?

When you have watched all these movies but can&#39;t say no to OM SHANTI OM 

Yar kuch tu soch lete hum singlee ke barey mein

The bollywood actors and actresses shown in this video no one, married each other

If only real life mein koi aise pyaar karta :&quot;)

Talking about Romance without Veer Zaara is a crime:/

Last one from Barfi..just lv it️

Singles k jale pe namak chhidhakte raho

U mean all bollywood movies who&#39;s gonna u get into chamdi matter , increase ur expectations to a limit that it leaves u empty , make u miss ur ex and think that&#39;s all u need in life and  think ur life sucks bcoz u have no such &quot;special one&quot; in ur life .
