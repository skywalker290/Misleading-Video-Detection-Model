i swear if the zoo had to close because of this guy&#39;s stupidity.ill sue every one of you.

poor tiger! It&#39;s all very sad

it is very shame for zoo managemnent that they have not arrange security of human who are have come to watch this 

A tiger doing what a tiger does, how does one fall into a animals enclosure?   

The man was more than likely teasing the tiger and got a dose of instant karma , beautiful animals should be admired .

Rather than criticizing the poor victim criticize the fools who have the courage to watch a man die cruelly and moreover hats off to their courage they were eager to make a video of it too...Though it was his fault but he didn&#39;t choose such a death. Poor boy was a victim of the accident. The question is how come there was no security at the zoo and where were the officials and how did they let him climb the wall???? As for the young boy..RIP

you can&#39;t slip over an 18 foot fence. this is animal instinct. the man ventured into the tigers territory.

Why people  do such things?He has lost his life ...plus he has put others into trouble...!Many r now answerable! Sad... RIP! 

He didn&#39;t slip he climbed over the fence, nothing sad about this at all the Tiger did his thing move on.

surely the tiger could hav been tranqualized ..very sad..

so sad

Zoo security team can't save it....with sarm....with sarm....and drown it...oh god... Where are those who get so much salary in the name of security... keep watching... your condition will be the same.
tragedies like this exposes the laws and flaws in India....people helplessly watching a man die...hope the other zoos in India do learn a lesson from this incidence and be prepared to avert tragedies like this.
