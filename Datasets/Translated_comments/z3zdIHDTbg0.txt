2024 anyone

Nunca vou superar o amor que tenho por essa música! 

Em 2024 relembrando essa música maravilhosa 🇧🇷

今日はみんなで嬉し涙ながそうね！！

Mi adolescencia

2024 ya quiero un álbum nuevo de Demi como este 

La mejor

I&#39;m living in Philippines do you want to live in my my Philippines



I&#39;m the happiest kid 

No puedo creer hace años no lo escucho y me acuerdo patente la letra. Te amo demiiiii jaja

Thats the way I like to do it

2024 

ผู้ชายหล่อมาก

2024, anyone??

Hoy recorde esta canción, así que vine a escucharla 

I&#39;m not from usa neither my love made in USA nonethless i love this sound too high

This is why we need more songs about the USA and demi just sells it like a champ!! this song is such an honor to me being a happy African American!! Though I was born in America it makes me feel as if I were foreign but that&#39;s how I was made from God&#39;s view. He believes in all races being known as treaty and smart. He believes that any race can be itself. That&#39;s why this song is such an honor. I love being an American! thank you Demi!! Love you!! 

I like it when you sing this wonderful.⚘

Wow this makes fire

I never seen this video

Our love runs deep like a chevy

If you fall I&#39;ll fall with you baby

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

You run around open doors like a gentleman

Tell me girl every day you&#39;re my everything

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way you like to do it

That&#39;s the way you like

Just a little West Coast, and a bit of sunshine

Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time

Just you and I, just you and I

Woah, woah

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

Made in the USA, yeah

You always reading my mind like a letter

When I&#39;m cold, you&#39;re there like a sweater

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

And never ever let the world get the best of you

Every night we&#39;re apart, I&#39;m still next to you

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way I like to do it

That&#39;s the way I like

We touch down on the east coast

Dinner in the sky rise, winter is the best time for walking in the city lights

You and I, you and I

Woah woah

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

&#39;Cause baby I&#39;ll break the bullet

And take the blow for love

Woah, our love was made in the USA

Made in the USA, made in the USA

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

Made in the USA, yeah

Made in the U.S.

Made in the U.S.

PARTY IN USA

Everytime I listen to this song. I know the feeling of being worried having a partner who works for the country. And the most terrifying one is everytime he will leave me some important things, i know its a secret mission, unsure of him coming back alive. That was the old days tho.

Who still watching 2023

Loved this song when I was 15, 26 now and still jam to this ️️

damn time flies so fast! Demi&#39;s song and Kelly Clarkson&#39;s I Do Not Hook Up is a trip down the memory lane 

Watching it again in 2023

Old days!



Até hoje eu ouço esse hinasso, inesquecível 

What happened to her? It&#39;s like watching a train wreck speeding It&#39;s way to hell and it&#39;s actually heartbreaking.

This 5 minute song tells a better love story than most movies now a days

I miss when music used to talk about falling in love

i love USA. Thank your song!

2023

Nunca me cansare de este videoclip tanto la canción como el video son ARTE y me transmiten nostalgia pura.Te amo MITUSA🇺🇸

Lagu paling aku suka dari demi lovato

HelloI am a single girl living in SpainPlease, if a rich and handsome boy is going to marry me, marry me!

Our love runs deep like a chevy

If you fall I&#39;ll fall with you baby

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

You run around open doors like a gentleman

Tell me girl every day you&#39;re my everything

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way you like to do it

That&#39;s the way you like

Just a little West Coast, and a bit of sunshine

Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time

Just you and I, just you and I

Woah, woah

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

Made in the USA, yeah

You always reading my mind like a letter

When I&#39;m cold, you&#39;re there like a sweater

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

And never ever let the world get the best of you

Every night we&#39;re apart, I&#39;m still next to you

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way I like to do it

That&#39;s the way I like

We touch down on the east coast

Dinner in the sky rise, winter is the best time for walking in the city lights

You and I, you and I

Woah woah

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

&#39;Cause baby I&#39;ll break the bullet

And take the blow for love

Woah, our love was made in the USA

Made in the USA, made in the USA

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

ฟังตั้งแต่อยู่ม.4 10 ปีล้าวววว

2023

back when music  used to be iconic, really miss those days 

hey, still here! 2023 

It&#39;s 2023 and it&#39;s still made in the USA.

If you’re still here a decade later, you are officially a legend

Here since 2013

2023 still watching

<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak"></a>

This could have been a country pop award. Demi is a legend like Keith Urban, also my favorite era, really like how she returned to the moderate pop rock vibe but fusing a lot of strong genres in a good sense

️️️️️️

It&#39;s 2023. And i&#39;m still listening her voice

Amo 

MAY 13 2023

2023 ️️

I love her here, she looks so bright and full of life.

The Obama years sigh…miss them

I love demi Lovato but I hate usa because they destroyed iraq and all the middle east

Gente que saudade desse tempo, que nostalgia meu 

Still listening 2023

Love USA 🇺🇸

Mở to mắt ra hoặc giao thiệp để biết mọi ng xq

Con nhà có học k có vậy

Đừng có ăn cho no rồi nói xâu ,rồi boi nhọ ng ta

Ai cũng đi làm....sống đoàng hoàng...chu k như minh

K ai như mình

Tu trả lời

Đừng hỏi tại sao vợ hay chồng bỏ mình

K hiểu nổi

Mình qua chơi là người ta vui ,mặt mày thì y mới gây lộn?

Hết thuốc

Bo tay

Thì bởi noi nào úp vung nay

Ăn chơi không biết sự doi

Hen gì, vợ cũ nó ghét

Ng ta giảm cân thì được,mình thì không, cứ vênh váo

Uống nhưng &quot;khôn&quot; ,khác moi ng

Uống trà ,cf mà &quot;khôn&quot;

Giảm cân mà k bao giờ được, tâm sinh tuong

Ăn rồi đề,co bác,gái gu

Hen gì có bao giờ mà học hành lại ai

Ai cũng muốn chơi nếu hien hòa,chu k cần quen cái thứ cho dau

Carvalho eu lembro que quando eu tinha 8 anos eu vi na TV o clipe no dia que lançou que doidera

نشدك ناكلك الخايبة



Yeah I&#39;m a lot older than a lot of you but I have good taste of music I listen to everything I&#39;ve listened to salsa reggae funk old school r&amp;b soul even some country and western music when I was growing up we couldn&#39;t listen to anything else in our house My mom was in the country and western and that&#39;s what we had those two So I was working with my grandfather and he gave me money to buy a radio I cassette radio so I started listening to my music what I liked I like old school funk late soul music r&amp;b from the &#39;70s and &#39;80s and yeah so music is and then when I got into dancing I did tap and jazz yeah pays it doesn&#39;t pay off the long run when you get older all the dancing you&#39;re doing and gyrating it&#39;s hard on your knees ankles and hips and it doesn&#39;t help me cuz I wouldn&#39;t the Marine corps when I turn 18 right out of high school and I got out 91 yeah with an injury to my knee so that doesn&#39;t help either and it&#39;s funny cuz my daughter in high school she would she took dancing the the school provided it and she was good at it and she&#39;s she&#39;s 22 and she still keeping it up she&#39;s taking a tap and jazz and Davis is that the college you went to UC Davis she&#39;s taking tap and jazz and she&#39;s taking all kinds out like Pilates and I think there&#39;s another course she&#39;s taking and I told her she had one year to goof off after graduating from Davis last year so this year&#39;s coming to a close so she&#39;s going to be going back to school she&#39;s going to get her I&#39;m confused now she got her masters whatever next on the next to get and she&#39;s applying for some some science jobs at the research centers that they have around Davis yeah hopefully she&#39;ll get it I mean she I told her you need to stick with what you feel comfortable doing yeah so I like your music very much who it gets me what listening to your music and watching these videos on the phone is your smile You have a beautiful smile need to do that more and I was telling my daughter and it applies to you too she worries about too much what people think don&#39;t do it It ain&#39;t worth it It ain&#39;t worth the heartache or headaches either You got to keep yourself happy go to that happy place when you feel down go someplace that makes you happy spend some time there and when you come back continue what you&#39;re doing It seems to me you love singing so yeah but that gets tiresome too being pulled all all over the place when I was in the service I felt like that I wasn&#39;t performing but I was being pulled all over the place cuz of my job and now I&#39;m a surgical tech it&#39;s the same thing always feel like I&#39;m getting pulled but now I&#39;m rehabbing my back I was in an automobile accident in November I broke a vertebrae in the middle of my back it&#39;s healing and then my lower back there&#39;s something going on cuz I&#39;m having pain in my leg in my lower back and my leg and then my shoulder I got slammed into the a pillar of my van and a jammed my shoulder yeah I was at a dead stop and this way to hit me at 65 miles an hour He asked me why I was stopped cuz there was three cars in front of me that were stopped we&#39;re waiting for the truck there was a truck turning left so he can&#39;t go anywhere under someone in front of you but how patrol said she was battered doing 65 plus Total my van I had a cold van I had a goal in that van to see how many miles I could get on the engine before I replace it I was going to turn it back into Chevrolet I had 396. 000 mi on it I like that van It drove really well yeah so I&#39;m at home listening to music right now at <a href="">3:00</a> or 1:00 in the morning on the 3rd of April so hopefully you see this it&#39;ll cheer you up I love your music Love your smile You need to do that more You have a glow when you smile when I read about you but what last year when I heard about what you tried doing to yourself I was so upset with myself so upset for you cuz no wonder was around to help you with that hopefully you find some people around you to help you I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re still talking to Selena you guys were good friends I don&#39;t know what happened but you know you guys should talk I think you guys need to talk cuz a friendship like you what you had I don&#39;t know the stories behind it but you guys had a friendship that you talk about it You should talk this YouTube post somewhere and talk because you guys were too close just to let that go away and I know it&#39;s probably other people getting involved in your job your business and her business our body each other and they felt jealous she got to look at that I wasn&#39;t your fault and wasn&#39;t her fault because I could see I can see you guys are missing something you both missing something that you guys had when you were growing up and you were both were singing it&#39;s not there I see it but you you&#39;re getting back to where you&#39;re where you were normal when you were starting singing and I could see that that that power and how you perform then and how you&#39;re performing now it&#39;s getting close a little close no real close but there&#39;s something missing I can see it in both of you how you perform on these videos doing live shows yeah I know you both were hurt whoever did that but got to get past that because they were always eat at you that&#39;s something that&#39;s missing a good friendship a good friendship is hard to find cuz you have friends that say they&#39;re friends and then you have phony people that when you need them the most they&#39;re not there it&#39;s pretty funny cuz my wife tells me I need to go find friends why I&#39;ve had friends and look none of them are around none of them cuz they&#39;re they&#39;re always I would always come home like drain when I&#39;d be around them cuz I could feel their energy It zaps me I like doing things by myself yeah waiting for this all this to get over with so I could get me a gladiator Jeep and go camping where I want to go camping and go do things I like being outside I like doing things like I used to hunt I know you probably don&#39;t like people who hunt but I would everything that hunted I ate I don&#39;t trophy animals I don&#39;t believe in that cuz that&#39;s wasteful I mean cuz all they do is strip the hides off the animals and then bring it home and have a taxidermy person make a frame and put that skin on there and they they put it on a wall and then I asked him what do you do with the meat oh we just leave it leave it for the animals to eat I&#39;m like that I was never taught that or two shoot you take home and you eat it Don&#39;t waste it That if you&#39;re going to waste it you couldn&#39;t even be honey yeah so I like fishing I like the outdoors I like that I love walking on beaches when I was stationed down in camp Pendleton I would go to San Clemente and walk from the far right by the nuclear plant and I would walk all the way to Laguna Niguel the marina and have lunch and then I would walk back to San Clemente and just chill out in the town San Clemente town or I go to Malibu Malibu&#39;s nice I used to go to Malibu a lot and then to Long Beach Pacific Pier used to go there like when I worked in Monterey I used to walk on the the beach there as long I loved it It was long I would walk to where the the first warning sign of where the seals maintenance areas at and I would walk back cuz I didn&#39;t want to go in there I didn&#39;t want to be chased by seals they chase you So yeah I know that&#39;s a no-go right there and that&#39;s a long walk that&#39;s like 6 mi yeah I love being by the beach though it&#39;s quiet like when we lived in Monterey me and my wife our apartment is exactly like eight blocks from the beach and at night you could hear the waves hitting the breaking break down that speech though the wave motion that noise that makes It was cool I&#39;ll let you go it&#39;s 1:20 in the morning on the 3rd of April so I will drop you a line later goodbye  Ray

LYRICS

---------------

Our love runs deep like a chevy

If you fall, I&#39;ll fall with you baby

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

You run around open doors like a gentleman

Tell me girl every day you&#39;re my everything

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way you like to do it

That&#39;s the way you like

Just a little west coast, and a bit of sunshine

Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time

Just you and I, just you and I

Woah, woah

No matter how far we go

I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I won&#39;t have it any other way

No matter what the people say

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

Made in the USA, yeah

You always reading my mind like a letter

When I&#39;m cold, you&#39;re there like a sweater

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

And never ever let the world get the best of you

Every night we&#39;re apart, I&#39;m still next to you

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way I like to do it

That&#39;s the way I like

We touch down on the east coast

Dinner in the sky rise

Winter is the best time for walking in the city lights

You and I, you and I

Woah, woah

No matter how far we go

I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I won&#39;t have it any other way

No matter what the people say

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

&#39;Cause baby I&#39;ll break the bullet

And take the blows for love

Woah, our love was made in the USA

Made in the USA, made in the USA

No matter how far we go

I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I won&#39;t have it any other way

No matter what the people say

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Thought You Should Know” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you ️

who remembers when time when Demi ruled the world with this song?

Never getting bored 

Crack is a hell of a drug she was so beautiful smh

Funny thing is that I didn&#39;t like this song when it came out but now it just takes me back and you just can&#39;t help but love songs that take you down memory lane 

This deserved to be #1 on charts, so underrated.

Love USA

Our love runs deep like a chevy

If you fall I&#39;ll fall with you baby

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

You run around open doors like a gentleman

Tell me girl every day you&#39;re my everything

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way you like to do it

That&#39;s the way you like

Just a little West Coast, and a bit of sunshine

Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time

Just you and I, just you and I

Woah, woah

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

Made in the USA, yeah

You always reading my mind like a letter

When I&#39;m cold, you&#39;re there like a sweater

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way we like to do it

That&#39;s the way we like

And never ever let the world get the best of you

Every night we&#39;re apart, I&#39;m still next to you

&#39;Cause that&#39;s the way I like to do it

That&#39;s the way I like

We touch down on the east coast

Dinner in the sky rise, winter is the best time for walking in the city lights

You and I, you and I

Woah woah

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

&#39;Cause baby I&#39;ll break the bullet

And take the blow for love

Woah, our love was made in the USA

Made in the USA, made in the USA

No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know

I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way

No matter what the people say,

I know that we&#39;ll never break

&#39;Cause our love was made, made in the USA

Made in the USA, yeah

Made in the U.S.

Made in the U.S.

Made in the U.S.A.

I love it     stay blessed  Jesus loves you   ️

The beginning of this is so similar to kelly clsrkson&#39;s &quot;already gone&quot;

Não importa em que fase da vida eu esteja,ou quantas músicas sejam lançadas ,essa sempre vai ser a minha preferida. Aquela que consegue ser remédio no coração com essa melodia linda️️️

Miss yah 

Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father&#39;s who sent me. 

These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. 

But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. 

John 14:24-26 ESV

Girl, you are absolutely beautiful in this video, please remember that I love you since 2008, and I will never stop loving you.

i remember 14 year old me watching this, and how i wanted to have a love story like this (not the war part lol). Last year i met the love of my life, and i swear it is exactly like this, even though we&#39;re no longer together, i watch this and the feelings i get... it&#39;s amazing to be in love and be loved the same way back, i don&#39;t know a better feeling. But yes, it feels like you are in a movie, in a videoclip like this.

Eu nasci há apenas 5 dias de diferença da princesa Kate Middleton. 4 Janeiro. Me sinto filho dos EUA.

The RaptureFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.Deuteronomy 30:19 R.MWOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?

to be COMPLETELY honest romantically i did do and/or will SOMEWHAT like demi lovato because she&#39;s LITERALLY always had and still has an EQUALLY attractive face and i did do and/or PROBABLY will really LOVE her as a musician

This song make me cry  but happy at the same time I better off being single

March, 2022  8y ago

Perfeita 

i was so obsessed with this back when star-crossed was on the cw, because the same female love interest was on there, so this makes me feel nostalgic for that show because it was cancelled before its time 

This song and “Clover Cage - Blessed” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together

i loved this sooo much i’m so glad i rediscovered this

2022 y&#39;all
