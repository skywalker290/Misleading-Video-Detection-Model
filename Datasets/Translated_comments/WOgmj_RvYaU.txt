damn, Nitesh is an IITian? Dangal and Chhichhore looked like Mani Ratnam classics compared to the trash of Bollywood. dropouts and &quot;influencers&quot;, please watch this man and learn. A successful director, yet completed his degree and did whatever he wanted to. Do not waste your time or your parents money.

Apun to acid hai
Why did Sushant become the biggest Buddha?????
SUSHANT SUPER STAR 💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫💫

<b>Not visible but involved</b><b>Every suicide commiter definitely has a murderer</b>
H4 IS LOVE NOW

This is just a sample how Sushant keep avoided from his own movies

When I saw Chhichhore on hotstar,( I didn&#39;t watch it in theater ) I decided that I will not miss any of sushant&#39;s movies coming later on. I didn&#39;t knew that I won&#39;t be able to watch his last film. May his soul rest in peace 😭😭😭

Salman didn&#39;t like SSR .....  people  who said that ....plz  watch this movie produce by Sajid ..... who is Salman&#39;s best frnd.....people who blame Salman  listen I think  you don&#39;t know about Salman  any thing.....<a href="">#FarhanaVlog</a>

RIP Sushant Singh Rajput

chhhichhore is one of my favourite   movie.This movie inspires and also give good message to public. not get awards,because of movie mafia.who responsible for his death, they&#39;ll  get punished.they will lost sleep.

People should have cared, loved and appreciated Sushant before his demise. KARAN is faking through posts, T-Series showing sympathy, etc etc. They should have done it before. Check out my edits once.<a href="">

This is my true love, this is such a special movie... Now I have to give a story from my life to my life.
Why is yt reccomending me this after the main character&#39;s death😠

I&#39;m very sad rip Susant singh

RIP Sushant

I watched the movie on Tv yesterday and I couldn&#39;t stop laughing

Rest in peaceSushanth singh Rajput

this  good movie

What will happen to these motherfucker awards, if a gully boy takes out lakhs from the garbage and gives all the awards to us?, now what will he do to these motherfuckers, he will die like a motherfucker, he will make such a film, why won't our film get any awards? All the nepotism-maddened women get fatted quickly.
all of you listen that you are free for this you are writing this that i will miss sushiant but after 2020 in 2021 send everything out of the head who was sushiant ok if you really like it send also next year for justice for sushiant please🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇 🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇

Fantastic movie Everything&#39;s just awesome

My chhichhore act ....<a href="">

Hope that movie gets many awards.

Superb movie

This movie is so close to my heart! This is also very similar and cohesive to 3 idiots 💜

Make Chhichhore 2

Chichore  is available in youtube?

Acid is the most loved character

Only 3 idiot❤️❤️  yeh bakwad movie h
Worth watching ❤

Did Acid show middle finger 🖕
Awesome movie

Is this true story?

Nice story Beautiful movie  Nice smile  Nice all terms good through  we like your  film ☺☺☺☺☺😘😘😘😘

I love this movie

watching this from H4 🤣🤣

Really very nice movie

Is this H4 And These Friends a real life Story of Someone Associated With this movie .. I mean The way they are speaking .. It seemed like that only

What a movie hats off

Look at Naveen polishetty in the last scene at the hospital....lol

Beautifull

Oh my God this was based on the story of true characters😮😮!! Truly appreciating, these types of movies comes 1 in decade.... (Ex- 3 Idiots) .Who Agrees ??Hit like👍

<a href="">#After</a> 3 idiot this movie won everyone hearts ❤❤

Movie is awesome. Do watch... Btw is it a true story?

Loved the movie a lot. Great acting,  By every actor. (Specially varun)

Bevda is Professor at UCLA😯😯😯
It was a very good movie.Could relate a lot to this film.😀😀😎😎

And they say that IITians are boring

Some one please make special screening for Karan johar....

Love this movie to bits.. Watched it twice already ✌️✌️

Best movie

Very entertaining movie

My new vedio upload please check🙏🙏💓

Did anyone have a crush on Derek!!??

Best movie of 2019

What a superb movie 💕💕.  Student of the year 2 director should learn something before creating shit .

This is called a filmNot like <a href="">#Stoy</a>Sushant Singh Rajput nailed itOswmee picture H bhaiJaroor dekhiye

What is h4?

Best movie my all time favorite now 🧘‍♂️
Great movie 👍 and another great story by nitesh tiwari .I would say this movie is one step ahead of 3 idiot. 3 idiot  says to follow passion whereas  it encourages to follow it despite few failures or irrespective of result and teaches to explore outside world other than academics which is more important in enjoying  life and dealing with real life problems.

Karan johar should learn something from this....

Aree owsm 😘

Verry verry verry verry nice and best movie ....... and i like carecter sexer and mummy

Better then saaho and most of the Bollywood movies this year best story best screen play

My fav Acid

I watched it. A fantastic movie with a affective story. Too much 💪 💪 entertainment than Sahoo really

CULT film of this decade...will be remembered forever, the movie has great repeat value,jitni baar marzi dekh sakte hain!! BLOCKBUSTER and Sushant Singh Rajput proved again that he is the finest of this generation!

It's a very good movie, brother!
Who came here Jst for naveen poliysheet

Hit like for Derek
Is movie ke sath insaf wahi kar sakta tha jo hostel life jiya ho, a Masterpiece from nitesh tiwari (iit bombay) alumni

Much better than saaho.. I loved it

Even the entire audience has fallen in love with Nitesh Sir..... What a brilliant movie... so realistic, apt n entertaining👏👍❤

Well done we want behind the scenes

The only movie you can watch again and again after pk and 3 idiot

So this is half scripted and half true based flim

Shraddha 😍
Brother, watch the movie today as per your wish.

Itsa content that should be made a web series. It was compressed due to a movie duration. The makers Should think for a web series on this script. Showing the college life of friends and reunion.

Seriously.. never had any expectations after watching the trailer.. but it&#39;s a fantastic movie.. every character has given ample time n space in the movie... 🤩🤩🤩

Best movie after 3 idiots... Relatable 💙
Chhichhore  is one of the best thing that ever happened in bollywood

<a href="">

What a movie really jst loved 😍

When Meena(Kota factory) entered , it is the my personal favourite seen of the movie. Well it is the nice movie with light hearted  comedy. I think shardha&#39;s role is very less but she can do better than this.

Wow it is very auto biographical...I felt that&#39;s what made it genuine... interesting

Best movie of the year

Anyone after watching movie....?

Already watched this movie 2 times..

Fresh blossom of 90&quot;s&amp; gud messaging largely to parents, of teens dealing with pressure of doing great in education.superb nitesh tiwari ji

Friends, if there was a big star like Aamir Khan in this movie, then the public would have accepted it wholeheartedly, but believe me, the movie is very good and the story direction of the movie is very good, first class, the movie has been directed by Dangal fame Nitish Tiwari, the movie is... It ends but the movie characters Ani, Sexa, Mummy, Acid, Bhevda, Derek remain with us in our minds.
Movie is really awesome. Well done team.
