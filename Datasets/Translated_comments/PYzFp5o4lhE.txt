I have been in a one-sided love for 3 years till now.But only thing I can say Onesided love is that  Loving someone who doesn&#39;t love you back is like trying to hug a cactus.

Neither is anyone listening nor is there any setting. Still it is my favorite song.
I love you harsh
I loved him..and he loved me back... But i never tell him about my feelings... But we share a lovely relation of friendship.... I still have feelings for him but we are like strangers now and i&#39;m getting marred in a month...

Attendence for 2023 and 2024

A beautifull song

I still listen to this song for you. 

This song️ + the words of feelings in the comment section is enough to made you cry

Stop your dirty songs and  dirty thinking.

Blue movie

I don&#39;t have this type any songs because I hate him.

In the gathering with you…we are not there…there is no sorrow 
I am leaving a comment here , if anyone likes it then I will listen this masterpiece again &amp; again ️️️

I thought he is the one...maybe he is my &quot;ONE&quot; but I wasn’t his one...maybe I would never be someone&#39;s ONE! Maybe...

Cant entirely understand the lyrics but oh Gawd! Y am i sobbing...

I never wanted to be with you!
So many people will come and listen you after when they loose her️

Don&#39;t know how to explain this feelings to her as I am dying every single moment for her but she thinks that I am just her normal friend and she loves someone else and I&#39;m just feeling her smile her cuteness her stupidity but can&#39;t live with her and this feeling kills every single moment...

I love her so much but she left me

Things that I thought you&#39;ll never know Stay Blessed Always Sizuka

Channa mereya  (  Arijit Singh  oxygen of the Bollywood industry   )

me listening it in May 2023

When I was 13, I had my first love.Loved <a href="">2:17</a>  her to the moon and back.And in return what I got was only memories with her.I hope she stays happy whoever she is with. <a href="">2:21</a>

How I miss her each and every second of my life, hope she is happy now. This feeling is never getting away.  Just trying everything to get life on right track.

Call me weird, but whenever I feel low, I read the comments on such songs. Seeing so many people facing the same situation gives me strength that yes I&#39;m not alone... This too shall pass  

Can&#39;t forgive this movie  just cried at every emotional scene

I used to hate the song. This is top.

This song is really heart touching song,,,,

Not me being sad for no reason...Not me imaginning my non existing boyfriend singing this...Not me crying over a breakup with non existing person that never happened...Not me listening to this repeatedly even though I have a exam in literal 30 minutes...I seriously need help

So nice song
I was in love with her for more than 8 years but she never accepted me. And tomorrow is her wedding day and iam here alone and cigarette in my  hand listening this beautiful song.Just be happy.

Sidharth shukla favourite song 
Recently I&#39;ve learnt the actual pain behind the song after losing someone who&#39;s very precious.

Arijit Singh
Every day why iam here.

Wth the comments so sad?

Didn&#39;t like this Movie much; but this Song is a Priceless Gem. I have been a fan of Arijit&#39;s voice for his 4 lines in Raabta song from &#39;Agent Vinod&#39;. But, he is so Phenomenal in this particular song that I wonder any Singer on this Planet has ever reached this Depth. This song reaches the inner depth of Heart; a place where only your closest loved one could reach.  <a href="">#IncredibleSong</a> <a href="">#BeautifullySung</a>

Such a heart breaking fillm and a superb film

best bollywood song

Ranbir Kapoor sang this song in Virat-Anushka wedding 

<b>Happy bday Pritam sir</b>  <b>Let&#39;s make this biggest anthem, stream and watch on repeat mode</b>

Oh God! These lines are just amazing. I get goosebumps whenever I hear this song because my story is one-sided. Hats-off to  Pritam Chakraborty for composing such a beautiful song. How can I forget Arjit Singh, He added life to this song.

YouTube algorithms didn&#39;t not recommended me this I searched for it!

Heart tutching song
Lyricist of the Decade: Amitabh Bhattacharya, Channa Mereya (Mirchi Music Award 2021)

One side love is really very painful 
Virushka

There is pain in your voice
<b>Arijit Singh</b> perhaps the only singer of bollywood who ignites the feeling of breakup among youth who are still single

Love this song

We are not the only ones in the party who don't want to be bored 
Better than the original??

Arijit bhai app ke jesi na kisi ki voice thi nahi hogi I love your voice

Who loves it more than channa meriya

National Anthem of one side lover

This song will never let me move on from her...

We are not staying in your party, there is no game, there is no game, there is no need for our closeness, there is no less, how many times in the morning I sat in your courtyard, I did the evening, I drank my food, my food drank my food_(x2)
Sajarul ks
Which movie is this??

This song is  national anthem of one side lover and broken people

It is not my destiny to meet you.... love is amazing :)
No comparison with one side love

How sad song But i love this song

I love dis song love you too <a href="">
Break up happens... And this song is silent... Why does true love... Cheats... How easily she forgets us... And we have spent time with her. I keep remembering my friend... no one seems like him... no one seems dear to him... but I know... in a few days I will forget him... he is the one of my life. You will be able to survive by banking this chapter.

This song is already so beautiful, unplugged makes it just perfect. 

That feeling of loosing someone very close that whatever heights you reach in life there is a void that cannot be filled by anyone else except that person.

After hearing Sushant&#39;s death ,this song hits me even harder

Happy Quarantinedays  to everyone, whoever is reading my comment, hope u find my comment, I usually don&#39;t share my story but, I want to tell you all that I fell in love with my Bestfriend and day before yesterday she came to know that I love her,  and then I was just , I told her one thing it doesn&#39;t matter &quot; you are with me or not always stay happy in life &quot; she told me I will never leave you. But the truth is, she has a boyfriend and she love him the most. But you know sometimes for friendship you have to sacrifice your love or in Hindi we say,  &quot; kabhi kabhi dosti k aage pyar ka gala ghotna parta h,  hope you all are well stay happy and stay safe.

A few things stay with you forever...like this song :)

<a href="">#Zarrain</a>
HiAuujeuAkkak 
I remember the time of my late teens-early 20s when I was with with my ex girlfriend - whom I truly loved for the very first time in my life. The smartest and wittiest girl I have ever met to this day. We were high school sweethearts and there wasn&#39;t a day that I didn&#39;t want to be away from her. How she reserves this child-like behavior when she&#39;s with me and me only. I loved it- I loved her. But as much as you may perceive how pure your love might be - people aren&#39;t. She cheated on me. Maybe deep down she did love me or were we just two people meant to spent a certain time together and only to move to other things - to other people.I remember the scar she inflicted onto me to this day. We were both young, at the cusp of expanding our horizons and about to experience adult life as we knew it. It was painful but eventually I forgave myself of the pain she put me through and I ultimately forgave her. 6 years later - despite the hurt she put me through, she always comes through my thoughts from time to time and reminds me of the memories that we&#39;ve made together - those were priceless.This beautiful composition of a song reminds me of the hurt of one-sided love and I hope no one ever goes through it. And if they do, I hope they do not preserve the trauma and hate from it, but rather a life lesson and knowing your self worth. Everyone deserves to be loved :)

outhg

O Piya, I love you.
I don&#39;t understand a damn word! And I&#39;m crying!

Story of mine

One of the fav song ever ADHM ....Ranbir and ahushka .   ARIJITH SINGH

Wt ha song
This  feeling is connected to her️️

Anthem of one side lovers
Love u arijit
Arijit
I just realised the strumming of the guitar in the beginning of this song is exactly similar to the one in One Direction’s Perfect (stripped)

This song is so heart touching that every time I listen it I start crying literally Love you 3000 <a href="">#arijitsingh</a>

I was a boat sailing in the ocean of love until I heard this song and drowned in it. Now my sail does not rise anymore. It&#39;s broken. Like my hopes and dreams.

Those who love arijit singh=Who who dont just ignore

By favorite song and ranbir best

A one can never understand the purity and deepness of one side love.. ️️️

For the love of God! What a beautiful song! What a beautiful voice! The movie  I love Indian music like that!!! Greetings from Mexico ️🇲🇽🇮🇳
Powerful film!
Miss u babu....every time missing u...kabhi to mil

My favorite song ever ️
One sided lover...Broken hearts..People who know their love will always be a failure.. like here.. Through this song ..we are family now

The best song
I can feel only Arjit&#39;s voice not ranbir

When you try to move on and found Channa mereya on your playlist....

Arijit is blessed with such a beautiful voice..

Channa mereya...
So nice song
i can&#39;t get over her because of arijit songs like this one.

I’m trying to find this exact one on sound cloud but I can’t find it

&lt;/3

I hope I'm not the only one who watches indu
It has been like 2 years since i watched the movie and i cant get over it the songs , the characters , the love story its all perfect

I love it 

Wasn&#39;t the original sad enough that they made another sad version...

I am not interested in kissing those closest to me.

What is the story of this film?

WoW

Ranbir wow

If one day my writings flutter between your  hands like a birdAnd your eyes start reading the words that has been written for themDo not tell the flowers about me As I fear for youDon’t tell about me nor what I meant to you  As I fear for you But do read my writings deeply And when your eyes become the SalsabilAnd stat  feeding the pond of your cheeks Do know... Those  letters which start to grow today like leafs on the lips  Has Been  growing in my chest for many many years So it can come back to you.   <b>Goodbye</b> ਮੰਨੂ

King always King arijit

Listening to this melody makes me feel saudade everytime. This eternal melody reigns on the top of my playlist and will continue to do so.Emotions come out pouring don&#39;t know if Arijit&#39;s voice is the reason or Amitabh&#39;s lyrics or Ranbir&#39;s flawless delivery.  This is the song that I&#39;ll tune into in my last hour on repeat while having glimpses of my life.

the feeling of loving someone n not being loved back or for that matter taken for granted is a feeling that really hurts.. it makes u sad no matter how much u try not to be.

Still

Wherever you are, you remain happy
