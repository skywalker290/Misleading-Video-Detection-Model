I have been in a one-sided love for 3 years till now.But only thing I can say Onesided love is that  Loving someone who doesn&#39;t love you back is like trying to hug a cactus.💔

Neither is anyone listening nor is there any setting. Still it is my favorite song.
I love you harsh🧿
I loved him..and he loved me back... But i never tell him about my feelings... But we share a lovely relation of friendship.... I still have feelings for him but we are like strangers now and i&#39;m getting marred in a month...

Attendence for 2023 and 2024

A beautifull song

I still listen to this song for you. ❤

This song❤️ + the words of feelings in the comment section is enough to made you cry

Stop your dirty songs and  dirty thinking.

Sidharth shukla favourite song 😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😭😭
Recently I&#39;ve learnt the actual pain behind the song after losing someone who&#39;s very precious.

Arijit Singh
Every day why iam here.

Wth the comments so sad?

Didn&#39;t like this Movie much; but this Song is a Priceless Gem. I have been a fan of Arijit&#39;s voice for his 4 lines in Raabta song from &#39;Agent Vinod&#39;. But, he is so Phenomenal in this particular song that I wonder any Singer on this Planet has ever reached this Depth. This song reaches the inner depth of Heart; a place where only your closest loved one could reach.  <a href="">#IncredibleSong</a> <a href="">#BeautifullySung</a>

Such a heart breaking fillm and a superb film

best bollywood song

Ranbir Kapoor sang this song in Virat-Anushka wedding 😂😂😂

<b>Happy bday Pritam sir</b> 😇😊 <b>Let&#39;s make this biggest anthem, stream and watch on repeat mode</b> 😊💜

For me the unplugged version is.better than the actual one

Oh God! These lines are just amazing. I get goosebumps whenever I hear this song because my story is one-sided. Hats-off to  Pritam Chakraborty for composing such a beautiful song. How can I forget Arjit Singh, He added life to this song.

YouTube algorithms didn&#39;t not recommended me this I searched for it!

One side love is really very painful 😭😩😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔

There is pain in your voice
<b>Arijit Singh</b> perhaps the only singer of bollywood who ignites the feeling of breakup among youth who are still single

Love this song

We are not the only ones in the party who don't want to be bored 🙂💔
Better than the original??

Arijit bhai app ke jesi na kisi ki voice thi nahi hogi I love your voice

Who loves it more than channa meriya

National Anthem of one side lover

This song will never let me move on from her...

We are not staying in your party, there is no game, there is no game, there is no need for our closeness, there is no less, how many times in the morning I sat in your courtyard, I did the evening, I drank my food, my food drank my food_(x2)
Sajarul ks

How sad song But i love this song

I love dis song love you too 😘💋💋💋💖💖💖💖💖<a href="">
Break up happens... And this song is silent... Why does true love... Cheats... How easily she forgets us... And we have spent time with her. I keep remembering my friend... no one seems like him... no one seems dear to him... but I know... in a few days I will forget him... he is the one of my life. You will be able to survive by banking this chapter.

I think we all have watched movies with great love stories and no doubt they were amazing....but for the first time....a movie about friendship which converts into one sided love....man I felt this movie by heart and specially all songs of this movie like a &#39;kohinoor diamond&#39; on a crown...♥️♥️♥️♥️

Watched this movie for the 18th time today... felt like 1st time ♥️♥️

Happy Quarantinedays  to everyone, whoever is reading my comment, hope u find my comment, I usually don&#39;t share my story but, I want to tell you all that I fell in love with my Bestfriend and day before yesterday she came to know that I love her,  and then I was just , I told her one thing it doesn&#39;t matter &quot; you are with me or not always stay happy in life &quot; she told me I will never leave you. But the truth is, she has a boyfriend and she love him the most. But you know sometimes for friendship you have to sacrifice your love or in Hindi we say,  &quot; kabhi kabhi dosti k aage pyar ka gala ghotna parta h,  hope you all are well stay happy and stay safe. Thanks for reading this 🙂

HiAuujeuAkkak 😍🤩😍
I remember the time of my late teens-early 20s when I was with with my ex girlfriend - whom I truly loved for the very first time in my life. The smartest and wittiest girl I have ever met to this day. We were high school sweethearts and there wasn&#39;t a day that I didn&#39;t want to be away from her. How she reserves this child-like behavior when she&#39;s with me and me only. I loved it- I loved her. But as much as you may perceive how pure your love might be - people aren&#39;t. She cheated on me. Maybe deep down she did love me or were we just two people meant to spent a certain time together and only to move to other things - to other people.I remember the scar she inflicted onto me to this day. We were both young, at the cusp of expanding our horizons and about to experience adult life as we knew it. It was painful but eventually I forgave myself of the pain she put me through and I ultimately forgave her. 6 years later - despite the hurt she put me through, she always comes through my thoughts from time to time and reminds me of the memories that we&#39;ve made together - those were priceless.This beautiful composition of a song reminds me of the hurt of one-sided love and I hope no one ever goes through it. And if they do, I hope they do not preserve the trauma and hate from it, but rather a life lesson and knowing your self worth. Everyone deserves to be loved :)

outhg

O Piya, I love you.
I don&#39;t understand a damn word! And I&#39;m crying!😭😭😭😭💔

Wt ha song
This  feeling is connected to her❤️❤️

Anthem of one side lovers😍❣
Love u arijit
Arijit
I just realised the strumming of the guitar in the beginning of this song is exactly similar to the one in One Direction’s Perfect (stripped)

This song is so heart touching that every time I listen it I start crying literally 😭💔Love you 3000 <a href="">#arijitsingh</a>

I was a boat sailing in the ocean of love until I heard this song and drowned in it. Now my sail does not rise anymore. It&#39;s broken. Like my hopes and dreams.

Those who love arijit singh=👍Who who dont just ignore

One sided lover...💕Broken hearts..💔People who know their love will always be a failure..💔 like here.. Through this song ..we are family now😢😍❤

When you try to move on and found Channa mereya on your playlist....

Arijit is blessed with such a beautiful voice..

Channa mereya💔...
So nice song

I hope I'm not the only one who watches indu
It has been like 2 years since i watched the movie and i cant get over it😭 the songs , the characters , the love story its all perfect❤😭

Miss you darling😫😫😟😟😞😞
Nailed it ☺️

What is the story of this film?

WoW

Ranbir wow

If one day my writings flutter between your  hands like a birdAnd your eyes start reading the words that has been written for themDo not tell the flowers about me As I fear for youDon’t tell about me nor what I meant to you  As I fear for you But do read my writings deeply And when your eyes become the SalsabilAnd stat  feeding the pond of your cheeks Do know... Those  letters which start to grow today like leafs on the lips  Has Been  growing in my chest for many many years So it can come back to you.   <b>Goodbye</b> ਮੰਨੂ

King always King arijit

Listening to this melody makes me feel saudade everytime. This eternal melody reigns on the top of my playlist and will continue to do so.Emotions come out pouring don&#39;t know if Arijit&#39;s voice is the reason or Amitabh&#39;s lyrics or Ranbir&#39;s flawless delivery.  This is the song that I&#39;ll tune into in my last hour on repeat while having glimpses of my life.

the feeling of loving someone n not being loved back or for that matter taken for granted is a feeling that really hurts.. it makes u sad no matter how much u try not to be.

Still 🖤

Who came here for Arijit only

Dard he tabhi to kam to nahi he.....

I always get feeling when I will be old I will keep listening Arijit and Amit Trivedi songs till death knocks my door.

Wherever you are, you remain happy❤
