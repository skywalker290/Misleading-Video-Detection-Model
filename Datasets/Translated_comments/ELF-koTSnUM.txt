Its Ukraine

Hmm, I want to try out Stalker… Let’s play the mod that set up mood by it’s name…

This mod makes people that don’t know Russian, swear in Russian 😂

Wish he did more of this. Glad i came back after a couple years to watch this.

Z

Chernobyl is in Ukraine not in rUSSIA you stupid

Ugh... huh... uh? PewDiePie playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R.???
That&#39;s not fuckin russia simulator

Pewds walking into the bloodsucker lair  &quot;lets check this place out&quot; me: 😂😂😂😂😂

Pripyat is Ukraine, not rusia

i have a strong feeling this game represents the future

Staaalkeeeeeeeer!!!!))))
This feels like I stumbled upon an early 2010s relic of the internet.

Wait till people release that this is not Russian game and it doesn’t have any Russian culture in

<a href="">12:00</a> so funny

This is NOT russia, this is Ukraine 🇺🇦!!!

Where did u see there rUSSIA simulator?

That clueless walk into bloodsucker lair... 😅

In Ukraine you don&#39;t play survival, the survival plays with you.

&gt;indie gameBruh this WAS video games back then

How did I miss this video

A typical American bully, calling Ukrainian lands Russian.
<a href="">14:07</a> this guy thinks he&#39;s in COD, stalkers, look how he spends bullets

Thanks god Pewds doesn&#39;t recognise Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty

dude, it&#39;s Ukraine, fuck this clickbait

Play another stalker mod called "NLC 7"
because chernobyl started in 🇺🇦

stalker is from ukraine

They need in the new stalker faction that’s just Russia and everyone hates them and is overly aggressive towards the faction. I think people would like that.

equivalent of&gt;First time trying Fallout New Vegas&gt;Choose DUST survival simulator mod

Ukrainain cheeki breeki simulator
Stalker is a Ukrainian game and the city of Chernobyl is a city in Ukraine!!  😠😡

<a href="">0:45</a> - He&#39;s a seer.

I can&#39;t believe my ex boyfriend even enjoys playing stalker call of pripyat. he plays it all the time bro 😭

He really thought of the war before it even happened

He can’t even kill the dogs god forbid he runs into some soldiers

First Time playing STALKER... installs Misery....Dude thats SUICIDE.

Hello

Wait this video made by pewdepie and he&#39;s playing stalker? I&#39;m going to watch it. Me any time

you play mistery you are the brave one

Hah! It was fun to see the misery....Good hunting stalker

this is not an indie game bruv

Dude i really wish he would have continued this and made a series out of it

well technically its &quot;independent&quot; ukraine simulator. But if this is true, then fallout must be us life simulator lol.

Why does this Russian dude get 4 Mil views and every other dude who uploaded this gets around 250 views.

Me cringing every minute

PewDiePie - &quot;just a normal day in Russia&quot;Me - &quot; ma snork must be high on vodka, forgot antirads&quot;

Umm who’s gonna tell him it’s Ukraine not russia anymore lol.

Damn, you fucking bloodsucker, I was scared of this crap!
he was a good stalker for playing misery

uhhhhh you might wanna retry in vanilla

Is not Russia, this is Ukraina.

He didnt even talk to beard Sad

I don&#39;t know if you are brave or a fool

There is a new releasing game &quot;Chernobyl exclusion zone&quot; just saw the lite version gameplay. I would love to see pewdiepie play it 🥰😍❤

O L D  I N D I E  G A M E

Anomaly &gt; Misery

Get out of here STALKER

You need to play the black road beginning &gt;:)

I actually want him to do a series of him playing stalker

No way.....Pewds played STALKER and I missed it?! A year ago? Wtf!!!!

S.t.a.l.k.e.r made in Ukrainian!

Idk how many billion comments you are around here but I wish you play this again and since your book fan, Roadside Picnic is what the whole game is based on try it too :)

Stalker is Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Watching this clueless swede walk into the most dangerous places casually gives me a huge anxiety

Heart attack Simulator

Who is watching in 2021?

I find fault but gp-5 is not molded!

Night Stalker <a href="">0:35</a>

I think one of the least welcoming features of this game is how your armor gets rekt by attacks and the radiation stuff too of course

I think one of the least welcoming features of this game is how your armor gets rekt by attacks and the radiation stuff too of course

Ukraine, Russia... at this rate it&#39;s all going to be Russia anyway. They should have just stayed together in the USSR as one big family, instead now the big brother is beating on the smaller one.

I love the spooky vibe.

<a href="">10:09</a> lol I&#39;m surprised he knows of Bald and Bankrupt😂

can u like play more of this russia simulator

and he never even found skadovskdamn

with settings I usually use he wouldn&#39;t see anything without flashlight during night

please try Stalker: Anomaly, its too good

If i download stalker cop from gog can i still play with mods? And where can I find them?

he didn&#39;t look at the pda once

blyat

He&#39;s still în his pijama armor and with his pew pew shooter and he goes to Iron forest. At the start of misery there are mutants every where. You dont use binoculars if you are not on a high rock. You don&#39;t look up, you look 360 around you. And you go straight to Skadovsk, on the pipeline route, unless you like cyka blyat.

you&#39;re wrong. the game is made in Ukraine, and the map you are playing is also in Ukraine (Pripyat).

You idiot game made in Ukraine and pripyat in Ukraine.

stalker game took decades for the making... bruh

You PewDiePie play stalker
I recommend you to play shadow of chernobyl because THE GAME YOU PLAY HAVE SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME and its a little bit easier in my opinion and more other stuff

Tourism in the CIS
or maybe its a burer

<a href="">14:45</a> i think thats a polterguist they are invisible douchebags goin around throwin shit at you

<a href="">2:34</a> how do we get up here us teleportation in old times bcs of RAD

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. not that scary when u have eliminator

A piece of meat, both in skill and in world exploration
what a pity that there are no Russian subtitles)
Can&#39;t wait for stalker 2

<a href="">11:49</a> SOOQA

CHIKI BREEKI V DAMKE

I thought I was back in 2014

Why wasn&#39;t he spamming quick save ?

CHERNOBYL
Pewds, honestly. The fact that the GP-5 in the thumbnail has a strap on it actually offended me. Not even you on that bridge came close to accomplishing that goal but my god if the thumbnail didn’t just trigger me timbers

<a href="">1:32</a> I feel safer with a gunSays the quite student at the back

I’m from Russia and can confirm this is 100% accurate even though it’s Ukraine

Who&#39;s here after stalker 2 gameplay trailer

imagine with the new game lol

What is good for Russians, is what foreigners are afraid to play! =)
Get this comment to 10k for Pews to make a full playlist beating that game

<a href="">7:00</a> where are bloodsuckers?

Christmas cheeki-breeki!

Fuck you
Interesting video.
BLYAT

Is this Fallout 5 Russian Slav?

Shadow of Chernobyl, dead air or anomaly would have been a better option, but they are not as creepy

No one will answer, we know your language, you have a question about how tourists will travel, here is a question, we added the Russian language
Imagine a Stalker remastered with modern graphics and RTX

This feeling when you are from Ukraine but some people still think that Chernobyl accidedent was in Russia

this is so painful to watch

sooooo your playing this again

Stalker in VR with Alyx graphics would be fucking epic

Pewdie : Russia simulatorMe : <b>Triggered ukrainian noises intensifies</b>

<a href="">5:13</a>Radiation : exists Pewds : there could be snacks

&quot; can&#39;t anyone be nice &quot;Stalker : No we don&#39;t do that here

It’s been a year and I never knew pewdiepie played stalker

How the hell have I not seen this.

I’ve had my eyes on the Call of Chernobyl mod I just bought my first stalker todayCall of Pripyat

WTF ? It feels like I first watched this Video yesterday.... but its been a year already ???

oof,you got a bad mod

pewds is a p*ssy....in a good and awesome way

A

Calm down stalker, let me fill you in!

I&#39;m ukrainian and cheeki breeki!

2020

i have done this game Shadow Of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, Call Of Pripyat, awesome games

I thought it was Stalker Call of Pripyat it turned out to be misery, it's a pity
Despite me and the game being Ukrainian, I agree - this is an accurate depiction of life in Russia. Thanks GSC Game World for educational games.

I can&#39;t wait for pewds  to play the new stalker when it came mes out

That&#39;s not how you wear GP-5 gas mask in your thumbnail.

STALKER Russian🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
How the hell he got scared on this game

<a href="">12:24</a> someone else notice some strange in pewds eyes??!!!

this is Ukraine, not the Russian Federation

He did an oopsie

&quot;BLYAT&quot;

Ehh that same mod....
WHY DIDN&#39;T I GET THIS RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!!!!
And now the newcomers are like uncut dogs. And they all know better than the old people/And the newcomers are now that dogs are uncut. And they all know better than old people...
lol PewDiePie is too soft for STALKER

Ukrainian simulator*
Calling a game about ukraine  a &quot;Russia simulator&quot; is like calling a Norwegian game swedish XDBTW, as a russian, no hate to my fellow ukraine bros)

This is not Russia, this is Ukraine, I think you won’t understand anything, don’t care
RU stands for ROUBLES

<a href="">10:45</a> no Pewds, this video shows that you are terrible at picking games. Like gosh, of all modes he chose Misery...a fckin ass-hardcore mod for a hardcore game.

I wanna make a thingI want to see Felix play this mode again so guys is up to y&#39;all.

Western spy in the zone....

&quot;L&quot; for flash-light&quot;P&quot; for your PDA (and also map in it)&quot;6&quot; for bolts (to trow in anomalies)

Man, i had a lot of fun watching this, but am saddened bout the fact that you went right for misery.Stalker is a series of 3 games, and you should really start by playing the first one shadow of chernobyl, then attempt the second one, drop it because its janky, and then play call of pripyat, and after mastering that, play misery then anomaly.Going straight for misery is like it was your first time playing minecraft and you decide to teleport to the end to fistfight the ender dragon, with no items or prior knowledge of the game.Pick up shadow of  chernobyl, its a bit of a difficult game, but with the non modded game you get stuff like a minimap, armor that actually protects you, and enemies that dont eat bullets for years on end and then turns around and spit you dead in an instant, but still with this spooky atmosphere that your viewers will love to see you in!

we need to get Felix to play all 3 stalker games

<a href="">8:10</a>

But then Get killed by a Bloodsucker

The guy do a channel about videogames and never played STALKER, seriously ?

That mod is NOT recommended for the newbie :v

🤣Тhanks ,remembered about me
Pls play stalker soc
Yes, yes, he famously brushed off violations for swearing 🤣 <a href="">11:52</a>
Can somebody remind pewds to play this game in reddit or something?

good reaction to the game! I wish I could see you escape from Tarkov

That feeling when you passed it 4 times😂
welkome

Hello, please play dayz
he even didnt start the story lol) next time look at radar and try to use the lantern by pressing f im the one who plyed a lot of stalker mods and i can easy say that there is no more game with an atmosphere like this, even METRO that is my top 3 game is not as good in atmosphere as this )if u search a really good trilogy try mass effect and metro, but i can advise u to strat from mass effect 2 and search the mod with the comics because the first game is not the best, but second and third are really gorgeous.

Oh, lard, lard, lard, Ukrainian lard,
Oh, how tasty it is and there is always a shortage of it,
I'm already so used to lard, there is onion and garlic,
Put fat on your tongue.
Lard, lard, lard, Ukrainian lard,
Ukrainians will always have enough lard.
So that you and we always have everything,
We must eat our lard!
Is there anyone from Russia?
Heh, the stalker made me swear in Russian😀😀😀 and this was at the beginning of the game. so that it would be scary to think further🤣
Play stalker clear sky ;)
Start with the older versions this game takes the cake with diferent endings.

blyat))

Well done! But to familiarize yourself with the universe S.T.A.L.K.E.R you need to start from the first part of the game &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl &quot;.

Class
Heartbroken :)
Seriously? Why is he talking so stupidly?! And if he can’t play normally, then what hardcore mod downloaded to stalker Call of Pripyat
Good to PieDie this &quot;octopus guys&quot; (bloodsuckers actually) don&#39;t make their original sound. After hundreds of hours playing stalker it still scares the shit

Scary thing
Dude, don't give up, kill the mutants.
Pewds play METRO 2033 please!!

RU is Ruble like Russian currency

I'm afraid to imagine if he played NLC 7 or Dead Air.
who after the DeeVan video?)
Wolf
I went to the burer with one click
When you go for bread in Donbass
Hello from Russia

why are there so few Russians here?
I demand a continuation of the bonquet.
Go your way, stalker
Holy shit he’s playing stalker

the lighting on pewds face is perfect

It isn&#39;t russia simulator, this is ukrainian game.

Pewds shoots tiny peopleThe media: pewdiepie hates dwarf confirmed

Ahhahahahaha, I completed it when I was 5 years old)
Stalker not russian games

Well, we are waiting for the continuation of your adventures on the territory of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.😉👍

What did you expect, bro?) This is Chernobyl!

Please. More

Why It took me 9 months to realize he played this????

love this game pls make some more but not misery xd

I'm Russian-Im russian
Playing MISERY as your first STALKER experience is like trying to bench press 120kg on your first day at the gym

Let's have more stalker =)
Fun fact guys <b>STALKER 2 IS COMING IN 2021</b>
How wonderful Chelyabinsk.
If you were born in the CIS, then you chose high difficulty at birth. It's too early for you to play our games))
Just a normal day in Russia. It&#39;s Ukraine, isn&#39;t it?

It's okay, he tried)
They say the second part is coming soon, I hope you’ll appreciate it, they say it will be released in early 2021
I am amused by his game of stalker) if he played in the shadow of Chernobyl, which I am wondering about, everything would be even more fun)
We need MORE bro

<b>I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE OF THE STALKER!!! AND YOU, COME IN DON’T linger</b>
:) i&#39;m russha man I don’t understand English:(((
Dead Air it&#39;s better

Slava monolith, Slava monolith
Glory to Ukraine
I caught an olive! well chiki BRIKI in DAMKI!

<a href="">0:35</a> O heres homeless Boris already collecting bottles.

Its not indie))and that places with fire much safer than roads)Game tells about alternative reality, about Chernobyl nuclear accident, when tons of radiation pop up into atmosphere, and radiation creates some mutants, artifact&#39;s, before play something like that, Read a book Arkady and Boris Strugatsky : Roadside picnic, its similar, and get you some understanding whats going on around))P.S.Its not russia simulator, its simulation of Ukrainian nuclear catastrophe, using USSR writers novel about mankind catastrophes and Human greed

The best

And nooo! Chikibriki and in spots!
Misery for the first Time not really a good idea

The game is not russian it’s Ukrainian

Still playing the games.

Ukraine chernobyl pyprat npp explosion

We want more u.u

I played within a day😂 played like 20times

This is a great game❤️

i wish he came back and play Dead Air mod

how does a youtuber with this standarts come to this mod XDDthere&#39;s a basegame and literally hundreds of other mods that are &#39;&#39;easier&#39;&#39; + stalker anomaly which is a standalone game/mod pretty much based on every game in the series and this guy .. i mean the first thing you see in the description is his minecraft playlist.. no wonder he shits his pants... or maybe that&#39;s the point of the videos.. like markeplier and those other dudes who make videos just for the sake to scream the whole time..

PewDiePie:can&#39;t kill a dogI:kill a bloodsucker with a knife

The game is Ukrainian
It would be nice if you make a full playtrough of S.T.A.L.K.E.R shadow of Chernobyl whit autumn aurora

He seriously plays STALKER for the first time and plays Misery? That&#39;s brave.

If yer gonna start yer Zone adventures with a mod, I recommend any version of Oblivion Lost (especially Oblivion Lost 2010). Really best to play unmodded &#39;Shadow of Chernobyl&#39; first, though.

This is the content I understand
<a href="">11:49</a> u r russian now, comrade
well damn well why are you just bobby you still The pseudo-giant did not see And the one you named an octopus it was a bloodsucker and he is not offensive like I&#39;m Russian forgive me for my English and please write down another letplay on the stalker как говорится сука блять )))
Well at least he didn&#39;t progress enough to fight Chimeras haha

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is terrible because it did this to Ukraine Cheers from Ukraine
Such is life in the Zone

On <a href="">16:18</a> you can kinda see what does the word &quot;Fear&quot; mean on pewdiepie&#39;s face.

STALKER - indie gameCS:GO - failed startup
<a href="">8:12</a> pewpewpie gets attack by a bloodsucker for the first time and gets scared the shit out of (edit <a href="">10:52</a> THATS BABUSHKA DONT CALL HER TINY!!!!)

Cheeki breeki intensifies
pewds: stay off the roads....me: he a little confuse but he got the spirit

Why is he so scared of this? Wait is this because I haven’t installed mods?

its looks like escape from tarkov

When you play CoP/Misery first time:1) Read the gameplay manual(not a big deal but you have to understand there&#39;s almost nothing out there gameplay wise , similar to this)2:) Don&#39;t &quot;check this place out&quot;(or other places) , head straight to Skadovsk haven...3)Once at Skadovsk , don&#39;t pick up any quests yet start reading everything about items , about effects of radiation, hunger,bad food etc... as much as you can4)Buy a shotty and ammo( or find one if you are lucky ,even if it&#39;s busted and jams alot) and start grinding mutants around Skadovsk using highround (rocks etc) don&#39;t head out too far out into the wild...the Zone is a very dynamic place , mutants and all other kind of  scum roam the place, fight each other, die and drop loot, whenever you hear shots fired in the distance pick up the binoculars and scout the whole scene there might be good treasure involved.Loot fuckin everything from corpses and what you don&#39;t need ,sell to the traders at base even it&#39;s a shitty price after a couple of hours you&#39;ll see money piling up.Usually keep a 5&#39;45 rifle at first  because that&#39;s the most common caliber for assault rifles, don&#39;t even think about repairing it or improving it, when it&#39;s almost busted ,replace it with other weapon of the same type.5) Usefull tip :when grinding mutants in the first hours check the gas station from time to time as mercenaries , bandits tend to camp there , get in fights with stalkers or mutants  and mercs especially can drop some insanely good gear and consumables (medicine, food etc).

Its a cod4 map

Me: finishes 2 stalker gamesAlso me: there&#39;s a hotkey for bandages?

I am actually impressed he even TRIED this tbh. I wasn&#39;t expecting him of all people to give a hardcore mod like this the time of day - but I def recommend Anomaly 1.5 instead.Doesn&#39;t need installation or previous titles installed. As Todd says &quot;It just works&quot;

without playing stalker, play a miserigenial plan
Stalker - is Ukrainian game!) Goood game!)

Marcia: darling, throw out the trash Pew: darling, I'm a snork
I thought this video was 5 years old

This video really felt like the old times

He should try again with just Vanilla Shadow of Chernobyl (on Master Difficulty of course) instead of just diving headfirst into a hardcore mod.

Its quite cool to think that when pewdiepie starts recording he thinks we are all there to be scared shitless with him

I started cringing when he was going inside the lair

Choosing misery as your first stalker experience was not a wise choice Call of chernobyl would have been a better start

Congrats on choosing the most difficult and unforgiving mod! (...well, there&#39;s always Dead Air if you want even more)

What part of the stalker is this?
UKRANIAN SIMULATOR

Yeah, the preview video is just top)
I was waiting for him to run into the Anomaly

It not Russian simulator in Ukrainian life

Have you heard of binockulers?

STALKER - TOP 1

Pewdiepie plays: Ivan goes to the supermarket

atf agent pewds &quot;I&#39;ll Shoot A Dog&quot;

Pewdiepie sees a snork, that&#39;s not normal. Im glad to see you playing stalker Im a very big fan of STALKER misery is not a fun mod Im anxiously waiting for the release of STALKER 2.

This is how my dad went to school

Man, I was really hoping for bloodsuckers when he went into the bloodsucker lair.

never play stalker again drongo
Chiki briki yup!
The game is so hard tho like, VERY HARD

<a href="">1:21</a> Russian coins = Rubles (₽)
&quot;that&#39;s a normal day in Russia...&quot;Me as ukrainian:        &gt;:(&quot;...it&#39;s Ukraine is&#39;nt it?&quot;Me:      :)

Stalker is ukrainian game abaut east ukrain

man EFT got me into stalker im playing the 1st one atm with AA2 ik its not meant for new plebs to stalker but i want the game to to make me hate playing i want something very difficult so im playing with AA2 and its great really great game got to count every move while in the zone, if u never played stalker games give it a try awesome game!

Wow i never got the notification for this playthrough

Pewds, this is for you. You must play Stalker 2 once it releases or else...

Imagine playing Stalker for the first time, and you proceed to play the hardest mod for said game.

When I see him wandering towards the bloodsucker lair at 6.01<b>Action is coming</b>

poor western gets roasted by the octopus guy

<a href="">12:20</a> his eyes 😱

We need a petition to get pewds to make a full playthrough of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. shadow of Chernobyl.

That stalker 2 trailer got me simping not gonna lie

Play Anomaly instead..

This was such an amazing thing to watch, I played 400 stalker mods and I like Pewds even though his content nowadays is kind of uninteresting for me.

I want to continue the adventures of Putz in Stalker :(
Stalker 2: comingPewDiePie: Ah shit, here we go again

Hellooooo
Chiki briki and ladies!
Dude, did you hear? STALKER 2 for Xbox?! WHAT?!

XD

Stalker 2 got announced in the xbox showcase 2020.

&quot;Are there earthquakes in Ukraine&quot;Earth: <b>Quakes</b>Ukraine: ???

try call of Chernobyl it is sandbox mod

Who is here after the stalker 2 announcement?

Here's a video of the stalker even getting there (FOR the monolith!!)
Playing the misery mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. without having an obsessive relationship with the game is like trying to headbutt a nuke.

Can we talk about the fact that this is how Felix started Youtube to begin with? He was too scared to play horror games so he started recording himself &lt;3

why the hell did you pick misery for your first experience? MISERY! THAT&#39;S LIKE GOING ON NBA BEFORE YOU EVEN PLAY BASKETBALL

PDP: <b>first time ever playing Stalker, where even the vanilla game is notoriously difficult</b>Misery: So you have chosen... death

PewDiePie Stupid. Russia has nothing to do with this game.
I got an ad... about Pewdiepie

Is from ucranie NO russian

Complete secondary tasks - you need to get hold of normal weapons and equipment. And also don’t disdain quest tasks. You will complete the main tasks later.
Pls Play in Dead Air

Bruh i got a magnetic motivation pewdiepie ad

misery-it&#39;s horror mode
your&#39;e using a polish gas mask for the thumbnail

Calling Stalker an indie game in the CIS can get you in the face
pewdiepie: <b>looks at sun</b> is that radiation?everyone: well no but yes

Coward
Subtitles please
Who is Russian?
Please play original stalker call of Pripyat

It’s funny, how Pewds is scared of everything in STALKER, when you play this game literally every day)

Finally this video was made, I love stalker

STALKER TOP!English: S.T.A.L.K.E.R IT&#39;S BEST GAME

5000 rubles huh..u are rich..

Please finish this game! I finished it 3 times, you will eventually get used to zone.

<a href="">3:50</a> STALKER wasn&#39;t indie game. It was game from Ukrainian company GSC game world

Many will not understand this comment, but know one thing.... CHICKS - BRICKS AND LADIES! Thank you for your attention.
stalker is not a Russian game, but a Ukrainian one, Pripyat is in Ukraine Kiev region, broglory to Ukraine

Ahahaha your &quot;blyat&quot; sounds cute
Are there any Russians?
pewd&#39;s scream is way scarier than the game

Blyat

Oh stalker
Russians like it so that English people think that there is something cool here hi
<b>Looks at sunlight</b>iS tHaT rAdIaTiOn?

Where is the second part? :D

What’s the difference between The Misery Mod &amp; The Call Of Chernobyl one ?

How do I feel if I'm Russian?
December 2020 be like:

Did some one as well get scared when blood suker showed up.

is it just me or the quality of this video is kinda shit even in 1080p

Stalker isn’t a indie game. It is created by Ukrainian developers - “GSC game world” and the first game came out in 2007. There are 3 games - Stalker:Shadow of Chernobyl(2007), Stalker:Clear sky( 2008 ) and Stalker:Call of Pripyat (2009). This mod isn’t ment for new players... i would suggest mod called “Stalker Anomaly” for better visuals, better gameplay and gunplay or the first vannila game - Stalker:Shadow of chernobyl (with no mods)

Typical day in the village
Guys, I appeal to you as a trusted and proquanil Stalker.The zone is harsh, you can&#39;t just understand it, there are other qualities needed here. Such as:Courage, intuition, cunning, (speed and strength at the last moment)Don&#39;t think that if you find a person in the middle of the forest,They will help you. You must survive by yourself, train your qualities. And if you trust everyone you meet,you will be robbed and deceived globally. Well, in the Zone you will be known as a Stray dog.By the way, you always look around. Mutants in the Zone, they are also not such degenerates. Given the glitches and bugs of this game.      You live there, you don&#39;t even know what they breathe in Ukraine...

Plz, play the stalker anomaly 3.0!

Slav version of Fallout

omagad, this is nice video

Heavy:gulman suck i gonna chek is stalker available on pootos so i can play it whit me cimrades even sniper and medic want to play whit me

A newbie when it comes to the exclusion zone should never touch misery. I’m a decent s.t.a.l.k.e.r and even I don’t touch misery. Pewds please play the originals or an easier mod

Ukraine*

does pewds know that there&#39;s a vanila version with easier game mods?

Why can&#39;t you play just original Stalker without mods? .DYou are missing so much cheeki breeki

Well done, stalker - indie game (I fucking screamed). And to start playing misery, it’s fucking stupid, I’d start with Shadows of Chernobyl. A very stupid decision, it starts playing one of the hardcore mods - brilliant!
&gt;Pewd playing Stalker&gt;Misery mod<b>Muffled gasmask chuckle</b> This will be good~

I hope he tries stalker again sometime

This is the fist game (mod) in a LONG time that has made Pewds genuinely scared.I love it XD

spectacles
HOW DID I MISS OUT ON THIS

F for everyone Stalker

Jeez. Pewdiepie can&#39;t handle his cheeki breeki.

Shiey irl .
Where Russian people. I didnt see any russians.I used perevodchic.

Don t be idiot play stalker of pripyat normal no mods

No no no the Ukraine

To tчustvo kokda oxrenel!!!
Who will do the Slovenian subtitles?
this reminds me of metro exodus

It&#39;s Ukrainian simulator 🇺🇦, not RussianWe don&#39;t like wheb you call us russian

I want to play this game but I don&#39;t know anything about it. What is the different between Pripyat, Clear Sky, and Shadow of Chernobyl?Are they different games or like DLCs or what?

Typical Russia
Bruh it’s Ukraine not Russia

<a href="">10:10</a> xD pewds watching balds soviet videos

Noob

PLAY IT AGAINWe love seeing you get scared

Pls play this again pewd. Make a series through the game

Choosing misery for your first playthrough is like filming a tgf video and then running to the shetland islands and back to film another video. I&#39;ve played the game for over 2 years and haven&#39;t dared to even touch misery. Although it&#39;s good that a huge youtuber is giving attention to an unpolished but amazing game

<a href="">11:49</a>

<a href="">15:15</a> did he say &quot;tiny pidors&quot;

Who is Russian😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂
By the way Pewdipie how do you like Call of Pripyat
And I am from Russia
Your best bet is to play vanilla S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and then move onto the Call of Chernobyl/Anomaly mod.

UKRAINE AND RUSSIA CHEEKI BREEKI

Russia top

Call of Pripyat with Anomaly Mod and Graphic Overhaul best experience of my life! -cyka

Don't freak out guys
Damn I hit a bandit
<a href="">11:51</a> Russian

It's a pity there are NO RUSSIAN subtitles! 🤔😭
Bruh, just watched a mobile pinball ad and they hit the black 8 ball in before getting the rest in, fuck mobile ads😂

What mods is he using?

More Stalker gameplays please

I speak for comrade Boris, Boris approves.

Now I would like to choose Misery for my first game of Stalker.
Even here there are no Russian subtitles, why?
Ah yes, <b>Russia simulator</b>

744

is RUS

this game all about savescum, because you will die from everything or your clothes will be torn apart and repair will cost dozens of thousends roubles. or you can play like pussy...but anyways you will day all the time

Foreigners think this is some kind of creepy horror game
ukraine chernobyl pripyat USSR Soviet Union 4 energyblock explosion
Bruh you used to play horror games every day of your life .....we need you to man up and play some scary games every now and then. I just miss those scary montages lol

Nah you&#39;re fine just take two bottles of vodka and you will be better

Ya gotta play Anomaly, shits way better

Thank YOU Ghost of Shotgun! 🤣

PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then

It's worse to live in Russia
Why start with misery?

my drean came true
Play this again or you are stinky

i didn&#39;t know he played my favorite stalker mod.

He's talking about Russia even though it's Ukraine! Like if you're Russian!

How can you be so stupid)) stalker is a top game)
ehhhhh such a feeling... staaaalker
<a href="">15:45</a> It&#39;s good to see some things never change :)

This mod was ruined for me because i had already played the game so much that i knew the whole world like my own house. fantastic mod though

I can&#39;t believe your playing this game especially with such a brutal mod first too. Watched Mr Sark&#39;s playthrough of the original gameplay and it looks completely insane, you should come back and try that first 😂

IT IS UKRAINIAN GAME!!!NOT RUSSIAN!!!!

Stalkeeeeerrr
How can i miss the moment of pewdiepie to play stalker?

Scooby-Doo mobile is called Bukhanka in Russsian

Chernobyl in Ukraine and the stalker game of Ukraine
It’s about Ukraine

I&#39;m from Russia and I like Ukraine and Belarus. I don't give a fuck about politics, we are Slavic brothers.
Go to the top so that pewds can see that the Russians are with him
I&#39;m russian guy
Those &quot;Russian Coins&quot; are in fact called Rubbles ₽

Bulat, Stalker is a Ukrainian game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Russians appreciated
Greetings from Russia. I&#39;m a big fan of this game

You should play anomaly

Now you have to play Metro 2033

Chicks-bricks and ladies
Where Subtitres

Play stalker shadow of Chernobyl it&#39;s the best one

Hey! Russian YouTubers! Someone translate
I play this game with my bot two soldier when they die i quit range

Fallout 4 but Ukrainian school commute.

Aaaayyyyyyyyyyy I caught an olive
Play stalker shadow of chernobyl

<a href="">11:52</a> what? BLYAT? Well, okay, can you say the word vodka?
It is Ukraine

I would like to have courage, or know how to play it, I tried it once but I shit myself with fear 😊

<b>Russian when watching (this is me) as a foreigner swears in Russian</b> 😂

Stalker is a fucking amazing game

use the damn knife

Oy blin playing stalker for first time and choosing misery is like making a child of 10 years old do a brain surgery

Now you know what it’s like when a Russian kid walks to school

This is not Russia! This is Ukrain!

For God&#39;s sake, at least play the original game, Misery is like a super ultra hardcore mode

For fucks sake at least play shadow of Chernobyl vanilla first

give us a whole series out of this game,not just the part2 :)

I&#39;m so jealous right now. Why? I&#39;m watching someone play STALKER that does not know it like the back of their hand.Right in da feels man.

&gt; First time playing Stalker&gt; Chose Misery&gt; I am confident in my weapon (in this mod, any gun is useless crap, and you will die even from old age)&gt; Can't figure out what to do
Do you know suka means b*<b>*</b> in Russia

Russians attack
You should read the book Roadside Picnic :)

The ground is like that from permafrost

no words only emotions...............
CHICKY BRICKY IN THE LADIES
Aight, Pewds, Misery is not a good way to start playing in STALKER

Wycca has a competitor...
Mmmm.... S.T.A.L.K.E.R I approve 👍
5000 russian coins LMAO

Pls know the difference between Ukraine and Russia, really

bruh who let Pewds play Misery lmao? The hardest mod you can get into as a beginner to the franchise and he plays Misery, where breathing the wrong way will get you killed, bruh lol

Ukrainian simulator* its important

Pripyat is Ukraine..

Are the Russians here?
Holy shit he’s playing stalker, this is too weird but in a good way

God this is so fucking frustrating to watch. I&#39;ll admit Misery is hard (there are better mods out there tbh) but HE DOESN&#39;T EVEN KNOW HOW TO OPEN THE MAP WTF

:) <a href="">11:50</a>

aNGRY UKRAINIAN NOISES

Play call of Chernobyl

Her
Lmao at the end That roast hahahaha

Felix, play something like Anomaly 1.5 or Dead Air. Trust me you&#39;ll like it.

Ukrane is NOT russia

<a href="">11:52</a> legendary moment

He never made it to the campaign beginning lol

dude the gunslinger mod came out not too long ago, never played it but i heard it was pretty good

Eeeee, Russians
Haha, I wouldn't last more than 15 minutes playing that game either, the same thing happened to me with dead space -_-
It’s like Rust but dangerous

You should&#39;ve just played the original games instead of just jumping into a hardcore mod

Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker. Get out of here Stalker.

There is always a small piece of Russia inside of every person on this planetPewds: БЛЯТЬ!!!

Stalker isn&quot;t a AAA class game, but it isn&quot;t indie.

Hello
Ok wow

You are the first celebrity in my life who has noticed this game series. Nice

It kinda reminds me of day r survival

Okay i play stalker and i&#39;m used to shit like that but the intro still made me jump

I’m from Ukraine, this is one of my favorite game and truly it’s so cool and funny to see how Pewdiepie play this one 😜

Where is the Russian??? 🤔
We are Russian, we are played by Pewdiepie Azaz You are Russian, you will be dismissed so that America will think that this is something cool
Heart attack simulator on <a href="">8:13</a>

Lol, i would like pewds play Solyanka, that would be fun). But for real, Lost Alfa would be best shot for vids.

How crazy I was at this moment <a href="">11:52</a> Russians will understand))
What does Russia have to do with it? The ChEZ is located on the territory of Ukraine (former USSR)!
Play MISERY like first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game, is like start a new civilization in other planet without technology

Shoulda played vanilla first to get the hang of it

get to high ground and scout areas before you go in. avoid combat if possible. stick to roads I think you can hide in pine trees if needed. loot spots are horrible in the misery mod don&#39;t bother unless you need cash.(most I found are bad). drugs, vodka, food and sleeping bag is your lifeline. head shot if any all hostiles. stick to pistol ap and or shotgun early but if you can get a good single shot rifle use it keep them all at a distance.

<a href="">14:40</a> Burer troll
I played vanilla CoP a lot of times but I am still not sure if Misery won&#39;t scare me shitless

Chicky briky
From the thumbnail , i thought that you were talking about corona virus 😂

WHAT? how did i not know Pewds recently played STALKER?! this should have been recommended WTF YouTube...

It&#39;s Ukrainian simulator, because Chornobyl locating in Ukraine

If this is a Russian simulator, translate the video into Russian
Damn!!!))))
Pewds plays Stalker the first time and just got the most hardcore mod for it GG

Don't let Pewdiepie become a professional stalker)
This is Ukraine!!!
It&#39;s Ukraine!!!

But there is Ukraine on the picture!

Stalker is a the best game

Ukraine is very angry now

It is not Russia simulator, cuz it is in UAAnd it is Ukraininan game

ALWAYS ON YOUR CHANNEL PEW

ordinary day of the Ukrainian. P:S:I am Ukrainian.

I played with you
I'm Russian eee Translation: I&#39;m ln Russian
I'm Thai.
<a href="">3:37</a> my placeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaa

You must play in original call of pipyat

Game of my childhood

All real stalkers know that in misery you need to take a sniper, not a scout, and if you do, then if you see a mutant, RUN, RUN AND HOPE THAT YOUR ENDURANCE DOESN’T END UNTIL SKADOVSK, because even a jerboa can eat you
Misery plus gunslinger is hmmmmmm

pewdiepie will never survive in Russia

This is no Russian game.This is Ukraine  game

I love it how curious and confused pewdiepie is when playing this lol I wishd he live streamed this so we could help him

The hell is that?

Is the vid rlly dark fur anyone else

Pewds: ill kill dogsSven: chuckles I&#39;m in danger

To a westerner this is a fantasy story. To the eastern european this is a day to day life simulation

Is it possible to at least have Russian subtitles?
Nooo. This is STALKER :)

This is how I go to school every morning
Not for swedistan citizens

I don’t want to upset you, but this is a Ukrainian simulator (OH MY GOD, PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT STILKER IS A RUSSIAN GAME PISS ME UP!!!! 😩😩😩)
Game of the century
It sad that you started playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. from Misery. Misery is a hard mod for old players who know monsters&#39; behaving and mechanics of the game. I would recommend you too play Classic SCoP or Anomaly 1.5.0 where you can change difficulty level with many options. Also, I&#39;m russian and I want to say, that &quot;сука&quot; technically must be written as &quot;suka&quot; on english, not as &quot;cyka&quot;.

Get out of here stalker

Who is Russian
<a href="">12:06</a> lol
Where are the subtitles?
What a games we have back in the daysStill modded by community after 13 years after release, this is how you should make games

you are not afraid😨😱

Who from
Kybel&#39;vile?

do not forget to persist more often

Oh stalker
Felix: I’m going on a break finally Also Felix Felix: changes thumbnail of this video during his break

Pewds I’m a big fan of stalker and I loved watching this video 😂😂 but I promise you if u play the first 3 alpha games and then with mods then ur going to feel the games and learn 😂 right now misery is 2 hard for anyone that hasn’t played stalker and knows what it is about

PewDie, you choose a wrong modification for first try to discover this game. Better try any of Original part of this game. Misery is the most hated mod in ru community too

Stalker is a Ukrainian game about Chernobyl, which is located in UKRAINE.

Man i love that pewds is playing this! He should definitely start with the vanilla game, or even better: shadow of chernobyl, else nothing will make sense

La, where are the Russians, guys?
PewDiePie, You should definitely try Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl(2007) - it has great storyline and much easier to play

He doesn&#39;t know misery is a bad mod. He bought into le epic hard mode meme.

Pewdiepie: Walks towards Bloodsucker lair.Me: Thank god he isn&#39;t doing the hunting mission lol.Bloodsucker: Ima bout to end dis man&#39;s career.

you couldnt have waited 9 more days 2 upload this in 2020?

I caught the olive!!!
Ave legionnaires
Pewdiepie really should have done Anomaly. Top quality overhaul.

Russian Russian

And here there are Russians, or in English Russian man
You just played it again when you died pewds

PewDiePie plays the cult game from 2007, great game, but I haven't played it in years
PewDiePie Pripyat is located not in Russia, but in Ukraine

People! It&#39;s not Russian game, its just simulator Russia XD

That's exactly what FUCK)
The action takes place in Ukraine and was created in Ukraine: Pewdiepie: :Russia Simulator"Ukraine: well, well, well, fuck me
I&#39;m life in Novosibirsk (Russha) ,There are almost as.🤣🤣🤣
Pewds: I&#39;ll kill dogsKeanu Reeves: *gun clicks
I never thought that Pewdiepie would play Stalker
Just the kind of stuff I loved seeing pewds play the most, reminds me of Cry of Fear. That was a fun lets play.

Hello
I would watch it again. I read several books in the Stalker world and played in all the three games. All of them were perfect. Hello from Ukraine.

Let's change February
Why must you taint this masterpiece with your putrid stench.

I love this game the place near gas station that looks like a globe of stone is where you can find nice anomaly that&#39;s sells for nice money :D same with the globe of trees.

i really like pewdiepies comment section on his horror gameplay. it feels like there are no kids

Blin

Cmooon, more of it

Fuck, guys, I want to continue to see let’s play for Stalker from Puds!
This was bloodsucker !!!

Felix, please, continue this trip, it is a brilliant game, but you just go in a wrong place to high leveled mutants, and some hints to you : there are a map that can be used by pressing P on keyboard, on map you can find safe places, and please buy shotgun, it is wery good against mutants.

I definitely didn’t expect this, of course.
PLEEAAASSSEEEEE DOOO MOOOORRREEE PLEEEAASSSSEEE

You NEED to play Metro: Exodus...

To much radiation we’ll have to go around

Bro, don’t smoke Svoboda roll-your-own cigarettes

Is this supposed to be scary?

Can anyone translate this into Russian?
Kto cykin syn

Stalker
Who is Russian, like
Atmosphere is good, but i don&#39;t understand how it can be that scary for Pewdiepie. Maybe because i&#39;m russian and see this kind of stuff everyday (mutants included).

Reminds me of metro games.

Stalker is not a indie game and its not a Russia simulator

This is Ukraina not Russia

Wowowowowow I&#39;ve wanted to see Pewds play stalker since forever!

In the game USSR never disbanded so its a &quot;Russia Simulator&quot;

PewDiePie: I don&#39;t know how to playAlso PewDiePie: continues to play

Make A Series Of This I Love This Kind Of Game..!!!

Tiny people have telepathy, they will throw things in you, like the flying shotgun, you can loot those zombie corpses you killed, and I suppose you should have a map on button m or p, beware of anomalies, they can kill you instantly, you have screws to drop in them to test for anomaly activity, on button 6, and the octopus guys are called bloodsuckers or smth like that, they are getting almost invisible, but if you&#39;re accurate, you can see them, and just be quite near them, good luck dude. This game is one of the most legendary games in Ukraine and Russia 👌

Pewdiepie: it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine  Me :ahhhahahahahhahahahahahahah run what the naughty word

Just play metro pewds

Pizdec suka bled.Hello from Russia (hello from Russia)
Hello
If you were looking for a Russian comment, here it is!
We've been playing this since we were 5 years old)
What are you supposed to do in this game

Pewdiepie : <b>plays a horror game</b>Me : <b>happy bro noises</b>

Actually that&#39;s Pripyat,Ukraine a.k.a Chernobyl Disaster

In this game, actions do not take place in Russia. Judging by the picture that was in the beginning, one can understand that everything is happening in Ukraine. (The picture had the word S.T.A.L.K.E.R) Find it on the Internet: a fire in the Chernobol nuclear power plant. S.T.A.L.K.E.R was created based on this incident.

you&#39;ve grown soft Felix

No, you
