River valley projects provide excellent areas for fishing. Fish makes protein available to people at low cost. Expansion of irrigation facilities, Government of Bihar)😮.
Construction of river valley projects has led to a significant increase in hydropower production. After independence, many multi-purpose river valley projects have been developed in different parts of the country. Apart from this, many projects have been made keeping in mind the production of hydro power. As a result of all these projects, we have developed about 40 percent of our total potential hydro power.
Nice song
The country is rich in iron-rich minerals, but poor in deposits of non-ferrous minerals. The major mineral fuels found in the country are coal, oil, natural gas which are sources of power. The country is rich in iron ore, manganese, mica, bauxite, beryllium, silica, corundum etc. It is self-sufficient in sandstone, dolomite, coal, limestone, salt, saltpeter, copper, marble etc. There is shortage of petroleum, platinum, potash, silver, sulfur, tin, lead, tungsten.❤❤❤❤❤
The area under forests in the country is much less than one-third of the scientific model. To maintain the balance between human activities, the area under forests will have to be increased. The livelihood of millions of people living near forest areas depends on it. Although its area has increased in 2002-2003 as compared to 1960-61.

This song is just like sukoon

NainaJo looks at the evening meal, the naina is crying today, the Naina who wakes up at night, the Naina is looking at the main eyelids. Why are you here, man is worried, why is my life so sad, why are you despairing, why are you in my heart, why is there a storm in the heart of the sky, the stars in the sky are shining in your eyes today, your eyes are looking for the sun, you are looking for them. Those who have taken this oath, now this game has been changed.

Love can happen to anyone or anything at any time, it is an emotion over which there is no control and no planning.
Nice song ❤❤❤❤
Miss you papa.... may your soul rest in heaven

Love is a sign of happiness it is a unconditional, it is unexpectable, it is willingness to do and go beyond the boundaries where we created cuz of love people fight against world and some people cuz of world some people go against the love.

Mere ko kuch nahi milegaa nikal beta..u all 2 3 percent people r dead for me enjoy your life ..

I’m not from the land this language is in, but as a foreigner, this is beautiful, the tone and emotion in the music is felt by anyone who’s ears still work. I apologize if the rest of the world is myopic and prejudiced against you, forgive them, they don’t know how beautiful the stories, the music, and the history behind your people.I’ll be back to listen again, thanks guys.

Means of transport like trains, buses etc. have great importance in our civic life. Our world is not rich enough to build or buy trains, trucks, buses in large numbers. Even in rich countries, where there is no shortage of these resources, breakdowns of trains or buses are not tolerated. Caste. There is a shortage of these resources in our country. Therefore, it is very important that we all pay adequate attention towards the safety of means of transport.👍👍👍👍👍

Man has stopped thinking about new topics, man has stopped having new imaginations, all the juice of man's life has been squeezed out, dreams have become old. The condition of labor shortage has weakened man's thinking power.👍👍👍👍👍

The aim of teaching English in the high stage is the direct association of every English word or expression with its full significance - its meaning, shades of meaning and emotional atrnosphere. The teacher should not only know this aim, but he should also be so competent as to realise it. 👍👍👍👍👍

Women formed as much as 23 per cent of the mill workforce in the period between 1919 and 1926. After that,their numbers dropped steadily to less than 10 per cent of the total workforce. By the late 1930s, women&#39;s jobs were increasing taken over by machines or by men. 👍👍👍👍👍

Naina.. those who see dreams today, they are crying today..Naina.. those who come to milk at night.. their eyelashes are sweet in the sea. The Naina looking from the window.. I am tied in the sorrow like this, I am scared, the man is confused, I am still there, why is my life sad, Why am I in despair, Why are there so many questions in my heart, Naina.. The stars of the sky, Naina.. have broken in the planet today. You are here, my Naina.. Whenever I send you my dreams, I am looking forward to your place, I have taken only a few steps, Those who have taken this oath, Milke will challenge hard, I am taking away this sorrow, Naina.. Whenever I see your dreams, I am crying today.

In diabetic patients, the functioning of the cells of the immune system reduces. Due to this, less antibodies are produced in the body. Due to less power to fight the disease, it is unable to destroy viruses and bacteria, resulting in increased risk of death. Ten killed in landslide?👍👍👍👍👍

People had to keep the windows of their rooms closed even in humid weather due to the dose proximity of filthy gutters,privies, buffalo stables ets. Yet, thought water was scarce, and people often quarrelled every morning for a turn at the tap,observers found that houses were kept quite clean. 👍👍👍👍👍

So the 💜 touching song

The earth provides enough resources to satisfy the needs of all men, but not to satisfy their greed. A nation that destroys its soil destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, Which purifies the air. Gives new strength to the people.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Millions and millions of people are born in the world. But only some people, with their qualities, have become successful enough to be called as legends. They were in the fields of medicine, literature, education, music and arts. We remember these legends for their work long after their deaths. The memories of these legends live in our heart as well as mind. Let us read about some of them. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Indian team announced for Women's Junior Asia Cup, alcohol will not go to neighbors in Paris Olympics, woman suffering from mental illness jumped into a well with two children, all three died. Is CCTV footage being watched?🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

Why I&#39;m cry😢
Yet,till First World War, industrial growth was slow. The war created a dramatically new situation. With British mills busy with war production to meet the needs of the army, Manchester imports into India declined. Suddenly,Indian mills had a vast home market to supply. As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs: jute bags,cloth for army uniforms,tents and leather boots,horse and mule saddles and a host of other <a href="">items.New</a> factories were set up and old ones ran multiple shifts. Many new workers were employed and everyone was made to work longer hours. Over the war years industrial production boomed. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Who is listening to this song in 2023 tooAttendance do ❤
I still remember how i used to listen this song when he cheated on me on October 2017.Still crying its already 5 years and 10 month.But i was dead in <a href="">2017.Now</a> nothing can makes me happy.Please everyone pray for my health.I&#39;m sick mentally and physically.🙏

Standing in frorit of a conveyor belt no worker could afford to delay the motions, take a break, or even have a friendly word with a workmate. As a result, Henry Ford's cars came off the assembly line at three minute intervals, a speed much faster than that achieved by previous methods? The T-Model Ford was the world's first mass-production car. You please let us do our work honestly otherwise the world will be wiped out and we will not even know 💯👍👍👍👍👍

Very imotnal song😢😢

Miss you papa..... may your soul rest in heaven

No words to say 😅😔

Only Arijit Singh, rest only Aamir Khan is making huge money by doing emotional films, don't think about changing them, see in Dhoom, PK who has made a connection with Pakistan by doing emotional, by defaming Hindu religion, the rest is to show the truth. jhad funk mcd actor
This song is medicine of my heart .. plays in important role in my life..  ❤❤

I lost my uncle . I dedicated  this song to my uncle .Miss you uncle

My brother is very sad today.
90% of the songs I listen to are dedicated to my dreams, today I am listening to this song and crying because some dreams are broken, I never thought that I will see the day, all my emotions are about my dreams, there is no sound of breaking dreams but some people So from being alive it becomes like a dead person ,,,Why is everyone forcing their decision on me 😢 ,,Why does no one want to know what I want ,,If an elder in a family makes a mistake, the younger ones have to bear it.😢😭😭 In this comment. Whenever someone likes, I will remember about breaking my dreams 💔No one please don't like
Emotional  🥰🥰
Nice song 😌❤
When I am listening this song I start crying 😭

Love this song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
