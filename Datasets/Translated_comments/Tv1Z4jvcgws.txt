<a href="">1:06</a> can please someone tell me which song is this I am unable to find ita anywhere in internet

I think people should shutup about bb&#39;s parents rip and all thatI mean it is really good that people care but I personally think that whenever BB is seeing the comment box he should not be seeing his bad moments of life under discussion rather the good ones he showed us rather the good stuff which motivate himONCE AGAIN I AM NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMENTING THIS ARE HURTING HIM OR ARE SOME KIND OF IDIOT

&quot;Will there be a match between Kasauli tiger and Pandavas? &quot; legendary line ???

So emotional for me the happiness on the face of bhuvan Sir&#39;s parents the way his mother hugged him and the way his father told him &quot;kya haal hai bete&quot; was so precious and emotional.......Bhuvan sir definitely missed this moment when he returned back home from any where his mother opens the gate and greet him feeling so sad about him.........We all are feeling very bad for you sir since it&#39;s been a long timeAlthough we all are with him......Don&#39;t worry sir we all are with you....Om Shanti🙏🏻🙏🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻😞😞

This is only the third video of yours that I&#39;m watching, I was fortunate enough to have chanced upon your channel thanks to Dhindora Trailer Ad. I know now about the unfortunate events which had occurred a few months back. I just want you to know that with an army of fans who follow you, you&#39;ll never be alone. And today you&#39;ve gained a lifelong follower in me ( not that it matters). Keep laughing and making us laugh in the process.

Imagining bb returning to home and no one is at the door waiting for him.....no happy looks...no looks of relief after seeing him return.....those precious emotions are lost in paradise....he just walks in switches on the lights and goes back to bed with a burden of loneliness and despair.....Its not just him....so many people lost someone dear in this pandemic....so many broken hearts and hopelessness.....I hope this ends someday and no more tragedies are to be seen in any person&#39;s life......🙏
