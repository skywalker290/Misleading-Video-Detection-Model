 rest in peace my heavenly angel  paul William walker  I really really miss you so much 

that endind so emotional

The thing I like most about the movie is it‚Äôs not cgi

Roman, always complaining
Viry good videos

Hi

honestly furious 7 and 9 were my favoritenow lets see fast x..

When i realised Paul died at Nov 2013.. And i was born in July 2013.. I was in tears because my favourite actor died.. Still my favourite but Sung might be the 1st now..

Lol, the W motors Lykhan specs are all claimed specs, nothing has been proven yet. Seems to be built by a bit of a dodgy guy

Rip Paul Walker????-2014Best movie fast 5,6and 7

I really thought someone was driving
that lykan car sure is ugly af tho, looks likes one of those hundays

<a href="">8:42</a> roman never changes 

We are all gonna miss Paul because Paul is the best in fast and furious.

Miss u paul Ô∏è
Just Love how the movies were made

Roman car 
Without editing, the chases look much better than in the film, everything in the film is so blurry that I thought it was 3D graphics
Ads too long didn‚Äôt watch

Hello...
Supra
Roman, I can&#39;t love you lessÔ∏èDom. U continue to stay strong ai&#39;itSleep tight Paul (Brian)

Ending scene
I could watch any fast and furious movie over and over again. Theyre just so good man. R.I.P Paul :(

<b>Roman:</b> The car is ugly. I went to see my therapist about it. 

So these guys actually bash these cars.....oh my goodness....and here i was thinking most of it is CGI.  All those beauties.....sob sob.. FF7 was my best in the sequel

Rest in peace Bryan
I love vin diesel n wanna act Wit him.good work teams
That ending is really sad

Azerbaijanüá¶üáøüá¶üáøüá¶üáø
That parachute scene was shot in Azerbaijanüá¶üáø

The red car really made me cryy

Beautiful Sweet heart 

I really loved the mods for the GTR here, it&#39;s very minimalistic yet effective. The Knight Racer Mine&#39;s spoiler was a welcome addition to the car

it still blows my mind how they do these stunts IN REAL LIFE, with little to none cgi

<a href="">#Spperez</a>
Who knows where the road is and the parting of Vin and Paul in the last scene ??? R.I.P Paul Walker

I REALLY LIKED THE FAST AND FURIOUS BEHIND THE SCENES VIDEO
REPENT, BECAUSE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS NEAR.
Michelle looks gorgeous!
Michelle and Vin look great!

Jordana looks gorgeous!
Jordana and Paul look great!

It made me sad when Paul smiled ....
Go away in peace Paul aka Brian
James wan

<a href="">6:23</a> AYE! YOO!

(one question)How they put the used bullets on the car?

I thought the Lykan was a replica

I got so sad when dom died bother in the movie and in real life I almost cried

For me fast and furious franchise died with paul. furious 7 is the last best movie in the franchise. R.I.P paul miss u so much 

Any sight of the fast n furious movie thing brings emotions about paul. May you continue resting in peace! We loved you and miss you till to date

The coolness of American cars is amazing~‚ô™
Sweet voice
I will be at fault
domniks voice
R.I.P Paul walker 

The name should be. Accident and furious

<a href="">8:08</a>

Furious 7 was there best film 

Wow....very nice
The murky tip rationally kiss because boot numerically plan mid a damaging nylon. imperfect, knotty lisa

So marvelous
I like that raw steel concept on that charger

Rip

The cuddly pizza metabolically carry because channel randomly pretend with a telling receipt. kindly, doubtful swamp

If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and please Repent!! God bless you and your family! (Not trying to force upon anyone who does not agree.  )

Hi bro love from rajahmundry Ô∏è

rip paul

big legend in our little hearts

Rip legend paul
I am shocked that some of the stunts were not real

I missss paul
‚Äúwent to see my therapist abt it‚Äù 

To me the iconic B-Body Charger is like Kenny from South Park. Kenny from South Park gets killed in every episode only to be awaken in his bedroom &amp; come back with his friends in the next episode. The iconic B-Body Charger on the other hand gets destroyed in every installment, (18-wheeler semi-truck collision, explosive barrier collision, crushed by an armoured vehicle, sacrificial collision to rescue lover, tumble destruction, submarine explosion), and revives itself like it just woke up from a nightmare.

Roman owes us for the horrendous mistake that was the eclipse in 2f2f, he&#39;ll get over being in a Monte again .

Need that black red off-road car ha

2021

Yess ....it was very emotional very

I love all the movies

Malayalis undooo

Good  job
i love Paul walker R,I.P Paul
how much money you use to do this film

how can they break those cars even  a aston martin

:R:I:P: paul walker

The only thing that doesn't make sense is how common thieves ended up working for their government. Then for pleasure it prepares you in the CIA or in other select groups if you only need to steal cars and you become an expert agent.
I have watched all of the fast and furious movies about 200 times and I am only 15.

RIP Legend
2021

Yes it is
That&#39;s why the boys love cars more than the girls, the cars have limit, the girls no, the cars are like an escape from reality, the cars never cheat us bros! R.I.P. Paul u&#39;ll be missedEverything has been changed without you...

The flaky cheetah explicitly wobble because step-grandfather annually doubt circa a keen turkish. legal, descriptive question

I love this movi series.

Anyone else thinks it would be better if it was R34 instead of R35 in the drone chase in Furious 7

<a href="">8:47</a> even he said the car was ugly.Dennis just ruined Tyrese&#39;s car reputation in this scene

With the green screen it made me mad &gt;:C

Remember when it was about street racing and only had jdm cars were on the scene

R.I.P. Paul Walker
The charger is my favorite car in fast and the furious

I have a model of that1968 Dodge Charger rt

Paul Walker has a personal supra?! Wow I dint even know  Paul Walker Forever

Wow, I really liked Paul Walker, he's so hot
You have not destroyed any of the 7

Acting its risk soetimes

Oh that supra Ô∏è

<a href="">5:47</a> fastest car in the world I call that bullshit because there&#39;s other fastest cars in the world that is A fast car not thy fast car

This is why i hate but love fast and furious

Oh so that&#39;s the behind the scence

RIP Paul Walker. The ORIGINAL Fast &amp; Furious.

Let&#39;s take a moment and realize how much work goes behind the Franchises we love or hate.

At 1k subscribers I&#39;m doing a giveaway of old currency and pokemon cards

Rip Paul love you

Paul is not dead, he just finished the race before us

Actually they can produce lots of lyken hypersport to sell them lol

As soon as they sell the son of the devil
Man i want to see races

Best movie forever

Yo I thought dom was driving that .So I been lying to my friend That dom is fast as f7ck

Paul will always be missed by his fans 

Oh they need to crash for realR.I.P

Every car is a gangster car until dom,s charger comes in

you need to could see al the bullet holes if you want to make a Realistic movie

when you shooting on a car in movies if it bulletproof i cant see and marks after the bullets on the hood

They literally made the Arabic people rong they don‚Äôt wear like that

RIP Paul Walker

So from all of that there real bruh I thought they got good editing

<a href="">

I dont know if yall realized this. and i dont know if it was on purpoe or not. but. Brian was set in a white car. that is Pual Walkers, real personal car. it was also white and shiny. and Brian was wearing a white shirt. and a big smile. and the sun seemed to shine on him. my thoughts are. they did this as a subtle nod to him being with the cast and crew during the film and to mean. even though your gone. your still in our hearts.

I Like how the background song is the song from Tokyo drift last race

Does anyone know a way to watch the entire  collection?

I have Paul walkers car

I am only Arab
Dom: Gets his own signature ChargerBrian: gets a brand new GTR Shaw: Aston martin so signify being british Roman: Lol give him a box or anything, idk

Paul is a legend but he is in a better place now R.I.P. Paul Walker



From Furios 1-7 The movies had sense and story, but the fate of furios didnt had any sense no story, all of a sudden vin goes rogue like WTF!!!.. Could not find a good point of creating furios 8?

<a href="">9:30</a> wtf Bryan Supra is in live in fast7. This is real

R.I.P. Paul Walker you are the best actor 

R.i.p Paul, but why would he think it would be cool speeding in a hyper car

Come back Brain 

where&#39;s james wan?

How many cool cars did they broke in that movie?

films are not tin cans
You&#39;re actually smooth brain if you think they destroyed real Lykan&#39;s for the shoot. There are only 7 in the world and cost millions. They basically slapped a Lykan body on a cheaper car. For the drop you could clearly see that it was just a body and a chasis

<a href="">  This is awesome, must watch.

I‚Äôm only concerned about all those beautiful G-wagons smashed.

What if somebody dies

RIP Paul

Hate how fans now just bitch about the lack of drag racing when the crew is out here building automobiles from the ground up

I love these movies so much and now I love it even more I see how much work they put in here man

Indo?

But i like all the saga!

Seven is my number of lucky. But i need to type this, Fast and furious 2001 the best to me.

 i think amazing all the work of all the team! i like cinema!

The lykan hypersport is beautiful! But Dom and charger rt is like iron man and his armour! I liked the camaro z 28, really cool! It&#39;s very funny when Tyrese say: &quot; i think cool, i think great but i think this car is ugly!  hahahahaaa

Acting is always fake

Any from Brazil??
There is nothing dirtier than the Emirates
The lichen hyper sport is not the fastest car it is the devil 16

I thought at least they were driving a little but don't screw it, it's all green screen
Oh down you it is..... Cossack

God damit.. I&#39;ve something in my eye.. :&#39;( It hits always when I see that ending scene.

Its crazy because there bringin han back and at this time nobody knew

Any Brazilian here? Hahahaha
Pauls personal supra? How about the 911 porche he crashed in?

Vin Diesel saying that his charger is the most iconic car in history is just a little exaggerated!! Only car enthusiast and fans of the franchise would recognize that car! You can show a picture of the General Lee, KITT or the Bandit&#39;s Trans Am to anybody and they would recognize them! The Charger will not be first in this race!

i miss paul so much
has anyone watched need for speed? in 2015 they said there was going to be 2 but so far they have canceled, does anyone know if it will be?

Very cool
Least be honest you didn&#39;t searched for this in 2020

Right now this is where I would like to know English.
GOSH!!!!!!!

Fuck you, don't you understand?
Didn&#39;t know that was actually Paul Walker&#39;s car

The cars in the Movie looks soooooooo coooooll

There is deception all around
R. I. P PoulUSED TO NAME MY CHARACTER O&#39;CONNOR IN EVERY CAR GAME I EVER PLAYED BECAUSE OF PAUL WALKER&#39;S CHARACTER IN FAST AND FURIOUS movie franchise

<a href="">0:18</a> IS THAT A SUPRAAA 
The fast and furious campaign will never end, children will soon be driving like in Santo Barbara
Rip Paul also who things instead of the Lujan hyprsport they should have used a regara or Hennessy venom

Respect for Dom and all the muscle cars

Paul walker was my moms favorite fast and the furious charectorI forgot something R.I.P1973-2013

Fuck dom an fuck u vin diesel...lykan is better than shitty muscle cars

Rip Paul Walker 
Ion understand the tire on the back of the charger like he finna pull off and change it mid chase

Best film of all existence
That doms hot rod isnt the most iconic car in ever the batmobile tops it

What happened to FAST and furious

If it helps at least I tried .!!.

I told Han&#39;s Story I told my Father&#39;s Side of the Story I told my side of the story I told my best friends side of the story I told Reid&#39;s Side of the story I told the crazy blond side of the story whom tried to steal my baby I told bobby&#39;s side of the story I said Scotty Sch&#39;s Side of the story Basically that&#39;s everyone oh yeah I even finished the whole squabble between Dom &amp; Hoch I told his story I fished it all the hardest part was somehow collaborating my brother&#39;s side of the story into it I did it but it was hard .!!.

I had to introduce my brother in the seventh series because I had to write the transporter series first to be able to make him into that character once I got that down then I could mixed him into the whole kitten Kaboodle , I really didn&#39;t know how to mix my brother into the series I had to kind of  really had go out of the box for that one my brother was the villain bad guy that I had to turn good and I had to introduce that to mix that into the whole series without any interruptions or without confusing my fans I really didn&#39;t even want to do it but it was part of the story that I didn&#39;t tell that I had to tell Cool Right .!!.

Latest TV Tume YouTube Channel
My hole  fucking life is shit

damn why didn't they show who was driving the supra ((
This car is perfect for me .

Some mechanics get to build fast and clean cars. Some, some get to build toys.

Fast and furious has a crazy car collection but i don&#39;t know why their brand is not common could be that the prices are high that people can&#39;t afford?

fucking amazing how this is made , incredible

paul walkerrr
Black in red is kitt colors in a show call knight rider, yes.

i know this behind the scenes this scene has before paul die pray for paul

Paul Walker said touch down baby

One of my favourite actors in this movie and then he has too die in a car crash. May he rest in Peace.

This is how many people give their respects to Paul Ô∏è      Edit: I was not trying to use Paul I just wanted to put out  my respect to the actor and many said I used him in a way I kind of did but I won‚Äôt gain anything from likes on a comment guys.

Lykan is not the fastest.the fastest car is called a devel sixteen

WOW WOW
