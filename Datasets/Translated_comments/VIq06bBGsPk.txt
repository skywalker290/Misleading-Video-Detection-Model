i like the tail

This was fake!! If you look closely at the bottom, you can see her feet!! But the real question is how did she breathe, and Get out the water! if she was a real mermaid, she would have swam away because mermaids don&#39;t like their cover being blown that they are mermaids!!

<a href="">0:16</a> wtf is that scream?!

Obviously it&#39;s fake, guys. Her entire channel is the exact same thing. The point of this is to raise awareness for marine life.

Fake 

If that was real, people would be backing away from the tank in shock, but as a fake show thing, it was good



OMG that is so cool

I love

She has trained for years and the last time I checked she is able to hold her breath for up to 4min and 32s, the world record at the moment. :)

Wow

Wow

Response to someone who&#39;s username I forgot xDThe government would obviously allow mermaids in an aquarium due to all of the people wanting to view a real mermaid. The owners of the aquarium would of course have to pay extra to enter. It would be a struggle getting them into the aquarium because they are said to be deadly and vicious but it is their habitat and nature

I don&#39;t know how she can hold her breath that long! Also that water is so clear! 

That&#39;s fake mermaids don&#39;t look like that

fake

She holds her breath for very long

Mermaid melissa is a beautiful mermaid

Nice job If I could give you a million stars I would but....i can&#39;t because then my screen is going to freeze so ya 

This is a fake mermaid if you read you see she is a proformer

Fake

That&#39;s a bit mean because they should let her free

Where&#39;s the real mermaid??????

I dont think thats a real  mermaid not trying to be mean or anything but im just not sure

She was born half human half mermaid O guess.If she isnt its so impressive.

this is not a real mermaid

how do you  become a mermaid love cannasia

No, she is not a real mermaid. They sell fake mermaid tails now and have professional mermaid actors. Some have been doing the mermaid business since they where 6. Practice makes perfect.

Real becuase i cant even breath that long!

Ok update, it&#39;s a woman playing a mermaid.. just type in &quot;The Journey of Mermaid Melissa - Real Life Mermaid Update&quot; and you&#39;ll see who she is, I think she does a great job.

Show of

....-.-



Are u a real mermaid??

There has only been little video proof of mermaids and they weren&#39;t at all associated with interacting with people.

shes a real mermaid

If it&#39;s salt water then how are her eyes opened in it? Obviously only certain fish can open their eyes in salt water and live in salt water also a human can only hold their breath for the amount of 5minutes as long as they are still, calm, and relaxed. That&#39;s proof that she could possibly be a real mermaid

my 9yearold love this

You know what was funny about this was I saw that exact same &quot;mermaid&quot; on a channel where she was teaching kids cool water tricks I will comment below the name of the video :)

how can u hold your breath that long

 IS SHE OFFICAL

I wonder if she eats fish pellets.

wa wacha wacha wacha lodpo what said?

nice mermaid

I love  it★

Guys its for the kids, stop the hate!

There is evidence of mermaids being real. I watched a documentation on the recent discovery of a dead mermaid. Two boys caught it on tape they were freaked out when it lunged up seeming to try and breath. It was amazing they said in the documentary that the navy and government were trying to keep it hushed up and they were only ably to show the footage now. Look up mermaids the body found.

i knew that girl ..i just dont remember her name ....

Fake only really only wow

Apoko si!!! :p

I mean that mermaid is not a real one mermaid have this kinda skin on there hand

Not real

Is this legit? Is she a real mermaid

Wow people shut up with the &quot;it&#39;s fake&quot; comments. Of course it&#39;s fake. She&#39;s a mermaid performer and her title is &quot;Real Life Mermaid&quot; just it straight. 

If it was a real mermaid her knees would not be bending Dahl



So fake

Cool, but just a real girl in a mermaid-tail :P How does she hold her breath for so long?

 1 we all know it&#39;s fake2 stop saying it&#39;s fake3 it&#39;s a job -_-

It&#39;s not suppose to be real

I think this is real besides who would want to swim on a tank with a shark if it can&#39;t breathe underwater

That mermaid would not show it face or web hands

I don&#39;t think this is real mermaid, guys! Real mermaids never wear bra!!

I love mermaids (because of the tail) if they did exist today, they would probably be in danger because of human pillution and some people might try to capture them

Don&#39;t be such a kid,it&#39;s a perform.

with enough practice you can hold your breath more than 15 minutes.. my record is 2 minutes tho
