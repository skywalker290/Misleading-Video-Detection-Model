Shes so beautiful and a really good actress. Netflix needs to show her other movies like Finding Fanny and Ramleela. I love her in those!

OSO, YJHD and Tamasha are her best.

YJHD is  and Deepika isAND SOME PEOPLE ARE SO OBSESSED WITH HER THAT EVEN IF THEY DON&#39;T LIKE HER COME AND COMMENT WHENEVER WHEREVER SHE IS MENTIONED

YJHD is my favourite movie 

She&#39;s the best ️

I read it as DEEPIKA = GAYANI.... 

YJHD omggg fav movie and that description ️

Actually, it&#39;s the dialogue which are good,it&#39;s not written by deepika,it&#39;s the writer&#39;s efforts.

Deepika is an amazing woman!️
