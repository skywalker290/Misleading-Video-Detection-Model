From the moment I first listened to this song, great vibe, but something always felt fishy with the lyrics.

El final de su foto en el plato es terrible , lo admiro para salir adelante , sabía hace tiempo , q la canción escondía algo oscuro pero no sabía que tanto era , hoy en día se saben muchas cosas

like the cat

ATTACHED A LA CROIX POUND MOi

This is quite an amazing view of art.

2024 any one?

Me and Justin jaybay is what i call him at home have been together for a while now. I was the inspiration for yummy the song he wrote because of me. And we decided to keeep our relationship private because he wasnt ready to comeout the ckoset yet but i let him date that girl so he can hide the relationship between us. Some people say im delusional but i like to say im an opporunist

The coming to light. Can’t hide it behind clothes doors forever

🇧🇷

Alguien 2024??

Alguém br em 2024?

This song is cringey as fuck

2024? I doubt anyone

When the dirty minded listen to this song:When the innocent listen to this song:

é pidofilu

El final donde sale justin de pequeño en un plato de comida… justo después de una tarta……pf, no sabemos todo lo que él sufrió

Listen to Justin Bieber&#39;s music Yummy in 2020, watch the video in 2024

Yummy food and love

Adrenochrome, child sacrifice, paedophilia...its no conspiracy evry1. Keep praying this gets exposed

What the message hey

4 Year ago I am 12 and now I am 16 but vibe

The pink napkin mouth wipes, the girls come out from under the table but JB is looking at a guy. I wonder who each of these characters are.

turbio

Here because of the whole p diddy and Epstein thing. It’s sad a nice young man like this go sucked into the dark parts of Hollywood.

Who&#39;s here in 2024

Yummy

What happened to his chin at <a href="">2:15</a>



The best song of the world

I love you Videos



YOU ARE A SURVIVOR 

Music ng mga Tambay na Adik

Here bc of FutureCanoe

Trying to watch this back and see the hidden messages !!

WEIRD video.  That creepy ending with his younger self on the plate with the word &#39;yummy&#39; under it?!  What the hell was that all about?  At two isolated points of the video, you can see the distortion of his mouth and chin and then his eyes.  It is totally out of place with the rest of the video.  Unless the implication is that the food and drink is laced with drugs, and our perception is warping due to hallucinations..?  That would explain the relentless spinning.  Something else I found a bit weird:  at <a href="">0:27</a> we see a sandwich designed to look like a face with its tongue out.  There is a piece of bread leaning against it, concealing what appears to be a red cherry or cherry tomato from the other guests on the table.  At <a href="">1:53</a> the sandwich is exposed and the red cherry has been replaced by a black olive.

On about 4 years ago?

god song be like i love justin biebers songs

Who is in 2024?

Never got the hate for this song when it came out. When you take into consideration the video and the lyrics and what we know about child stars now, i wouldnt be surprised if bieber has his own stories to tell. Hopefully he feels comfortable and safe enough to tell them at some point

I didn&#39;t see it at first. but this video is explaining all the people /peodos who&#39;ve abused him. look at how many people have been at the table with him........ old people,women,young women,men, then at the end of the video. when the tables are cleared...he&#39;s still left ........ sad.... dread to think what goes on

XOXO

pizzagate?

Its March 2024, let&#39;s see how many legends are listening to this incredible song 

I really like this song Justin Bieber  happy birthday 30

My favorite song

Justin Bieber has dark secrets

I like this songs from justin bieber and legendary

P DIDDY IS A LIZARD

Can’t believe the switched the video up so much

Who’s still watching this in 2024

This is my fav song when I was little

2024, still in rotation lol

Bro when it flashed to a plate with a picture of himself as a child with the word “yummy”… holy shit he basically just straight up said it

Anyone in 1st March 2024?

JB HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY IDOL BRO!!

El nombre Drew en el sweater me hace pensar q hace referencia a Drew Barrimore, q también desde niña fue víctima de toda esa gente, su baile en la mesa me recuerda a su coreografía de su canción baby, supongo lo ponían a bailar para ellos.

Listenin this song at the age of 29 now, understood the lyrics and all the evil done by the lobby. They are telling the story out loud. The people at JBs table are rich and old and they are here to molest the young ones included kids!

Justin Bieber the King 

Danny’s was better

Kinda crazy when it starts all the kids are performing for these old ass people and the look on there faces say it all. Its crazy its so hard to expose these sicks mfs because they are able to extort so easily with one allegation ect. Dam hes really been messed up by the industry its them not him

Love loyal fans

Always happy and lucky

Mensajes de la cancion para quien no la entiende:<a href="">1:27</a>Mientras todos comen banquetes y postres de lujo, el principal come comida chinaMientras la elite disfruta del dinero que el artista gana, el artista recibe migajas por todo lo que ha trabajado.<a href="">1:33</a> el niño triste tocando el violin  despues pasa por una mesa con un gato bastante peculiar por sus manchas, hace referencia a la zoofilia de las grandes elites..Te amo Justin ️

missing you juinst  biber ️‍

This songs me happy and love the songs big fans and love juinst biber as friends lost fom JB 2028🇨🇦️‍️‍

I am one of the last people to understand the meaning of this song

die.music.is.vijer

 i love you Justin bieber

You know, I think imho being a survivor can mean different things to different ppl. As for myself for example, I believe being a survivor is simply coming out the other end of a predicament or situation, who&#39;s still breathing but not always as well as before, or as well as someone else could&#39;ve , or sometimes barely at all! Whether one comes out on top of a situation or just holding your head high enough to keep going, Is A Survivor.J.B&#39;s innocence was taken, no doubt about it, and he was exposed to the darker side of &quot;surviving&quot; by those driven by money, greed, power and being #1 waaaay before his young heart &amp; mind would have.  He adapted. He had to learn how to survive in his field at a young age, like many others just like him had to as well. I imagine he was around things that would&#39;ve driven him insane every day, but to survive and to hold his ground and keep it together for his own sake, but (also for the public eyes on him at all times) for his label, his sponsors or whatever and whoever endorsed him and managed his income...But he&#39;s not a kid anymore, and (to me it seems like) he knows what happened to him as he looks back on his life and sees that younger version of himself on the plate at the final shot of the video here... And he&#39;s doing what he can about it now, in spite of everything.We can all see how he got eaten up, chewed up, and spit out by everyone! And he is still sending a message out thru one of the ways that he can, thru his voice - because he IS SURVIVING! Like so many of us can relate even without the fame and the big bucks...He is just a young man after all. 

Iluminati oficial

We love Justin Bieber he’s the best and coolest singer he is one of the greatest!!!!!!!!!!

wtf was <a href="">2:21</a> Lizardman‍

Funny how media thinks this is about his partner. No it’s not it’s about business deals and his sexual relationships with a male. His words I’m a lady, bona fide stallion meaning horse male !!! Come on read between the lines

This song related to the child sexually haresh ment and terrible

Who&#39;s here in 2024 

Any moosewala fan here --------&gt;

Much time has passed since this released, and Im just seeing this again in Feb 2024... Still love this video, and the song. Great collaboration between Justin &amp; Quavo, huge shout out to them and special love to the people in the community involved in this presentation... they are the true MVP&#39;s. Still loving this and them! 

This feels like something you&#39;d find playing in a terrible roblox experience in 2015

The song fireBut the food:. 

Omgggg

Justin Bieber love you Mikayla

At first I didn’t know Justin made this so I was like ok that’s cool until I found out today…

detras del video todos saben la verdad oscura que ocultaban en esa isla ahora solo espero no olviden del tema ya que el dinero lava muchas cosas malas

Guys this is the exactly place of the film &quot;They live&quot;

Ymmy 

Esse irmão urso é tão maldoso  fofo 

justin songs like `yummy!

Ojalá no lo borren, esto es referente al videoclip de Justin...



- <a href="">0:13</a> Justin llega, se ve a niños tocando, pueda dar referencia a qué están a su merced.

- <a href="">0:20</a> cuando Justin se sienta todos los que lo rodean le miran y se acerca, algunos de los que alcance a reconocer el Jhon Podesta.

Los que están en la mesa con justin le ofrecen comida , luego en los minutos  - <a href="">2:18</a> y <a href="">2:21</a> aparece con los ojos deformados e igual la quijada, dando a entender que a sido drogado.

- <a href="">1:49</a> &quot; perdí el control de mi mismo, estoy en peligro &quot; claramente referencia a qué está siendo controlado y manipulado y probablemente amenazado.

- <a href="">1:40</a> estás incrimado sin disfraz, es decir que abusan de los niños siendo ellos mismos mejor mostrándose ellos sin ninguna mascara.

- <a href="">2:01</a> esta parte también es importante , el chico se ve tranquilo y aburrido, pero comiendo.



Luego de unos minutos se empieza a mover también dando a entender que yaba sido drogado.

- <a href="">2:10</a> que asco solo imagínense que lo que comen son niños que han sido ofrecidos para ellos. 

<a href="">3:20</a> todos drogados 

<a href="">3:40</a> Es claro, Justin se queda solo con &quot; Jhon Podesta y su ex manager &quot; puede ser que ellos fueron los que lo violaron, ya que el ex manager fue acusado de abuso sexual mucho antes estaba aleg mucho a Justin diciendo que &quot; era hermoso como solo una mujer podía serlo&quot; que horror 

- <a href="">3:45</a> la última del pastel, clarísimo que fue el postre de estos imbéciles

&quot;Standing up keep me on the rise&quot; = as long as I play along you (the Illuminati) keep me on the rise and my success going &quot;lost control of myself I&#39;m compromised&quot; = Illuminati controlling Bieber&#39;s life and forced him to compromise himself &quot;you&#39;re incriminating no disguise&quot; =Illuminati incriminating people and don&#39;t even try to hide it, it&#39;s out in the open &quot;and you ain&#39;t never running low on supplies&quot; their &quot;supply&quot; of children is constant. These lyrics are SO OBVIOUS. How are people still not understanding.. We&#39;re reaching. Ok

Who is the guy at <a href="">1:56</a> ?

Food does makes us happy 

Pretty sure that old dude next to him is supposed to be Podesta...just saying.

Yummy ya respect this now

At the beginning of the video Justin just has a little sandwich, positioned so the bread is shielding a nice red cherry from the other ppl at the table so that only he can see it.Once the nasty food starts coming in, the sandwich gets turned around and exposed, and you can see clearly at <a href="">1:48</a> that the Cherry has turned pitch black.

2024 February, Anyone?

2024 is anyone

The best part of this song is the bridge!!!!

Justin the best all over the world

Recordando el pasado 

Who&#39;s here in 2024

2024, somebody?

2024 Anyone ?

It has been 4 years I haven’t heard this song

This  music  isILOVE  YOU

mariana is badussy

I good singing you number one

<a href="">1:27</a> ... it&#39; s to show how the old manager can watch what Justin watch , as showed in the movie Obey and a chapter of Black Mirror and a french movie called Bethy Blue too. They are able to use this kind of technology since 1982 at least.

The day this video was released was the day my daughter was born. I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - In The Sky” are the two songs that helped get rid of my depression. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..I love you 

Ye babe in the morning dhhdhd



I love you so much 

Man I haven’t listened to this song from 2020 it was 4 years ago so nostalgic 

Who cam after jumpers jump podcast 

I love this songHow can people hate it

Not even 2seconds In . And I see Restaurant hidden behind a restaurant for kids to get abused or whatever so sad and symbolic

2024 Anyone???

Nkfkkfkf

Hoka

Look at his chin

I really don&#39;t understand why people hate this song so much. It doesn&#39;t sound that different from any other pop song, and they don&#39;t scrutinize and criticize those songs even half as much. It&#39;s a fun song, I like it.

amazing

Solamente justin sabe lo que paso realmente y se necesita mucha fortaleza mental para superar todos los obstáculos.

Who is 2024 her ????

<a href="">2:20</a> look at his jaw

Symbolic of child abuse/grooming in the industry

TE AMO JUSTIN ME LLAMO MARIANO ROSS

<a href="">0:25</a>

When this song came out, I didn’t like it, but it grew on me. It’s a bop!

no inglish yes espanish

Justin eu gosto muito de você e eu estou escutando essa música pelo tablet do meu pai

yammy it is cod

it is zoo

En esa canción manda un mensaje subliminal  . El Saco está súper maltratado . Roto por todos lados

Estaba escuchando selfish del nuevo del rey pop JT y me trajo acá con el nuevo príncipe del pop. I love MJ, JT y JB

Your wear pink as well as Pink ;)

Jeffrey EpsteinJohn Podesta Etc

<a href="">1:19</a> somebody here in 24?

<a href="">2:34</a>

JUSTIN YOU HAVE COOL MUSIC 

I love you justin

Aaaaaahh why Justin is saying my bestie name

This inspired me to

This is the first time I&#39;ve seen this music video...i assumed by the lyrics it would be hypersexual and butts everywhere  ..but after i heard the theory of exposing child SA in the industry  (talking about the baby  promo images on his insta) and the glutinous nature of the video, and then final clip is him as a child on the plate ...idk

Me be like in restorane

Yummy

oke

nice

Who listenin this 2024¿¿¿??? I love bts

i love justin

his artistry in showing greed and how hollywood can never get enough is extremely powerful.

<a href="">2:20</a> bro got that supreme chin

Anyone in 2024?

2024???

왜앗을일인까요?

야미무슨뜻인가요

it&#39;s the way i&#39;m just now getting what this music video actually meant...so sad

What’s the issue with this? He’s enjoying food &amp; talking about his wife

I wonder if Bruce Falconer has heard this song … sounds very similar to Gohan’s Anger

Jefrey epstein

I love this song its so hyped and it the one and only justin bieber

2024 anyone?

You taste so much, eat me and my heart will say yummy yummy 

Who listening to this in 2024?

Never thought id say this, but is JB one of the real ones?

We are so sorry justin

justin has done shitty things but he’s literally been through the wringer omg. not only did he get exploited, possibly SAed, and taken advantage of from people in hollywood but he was also massively bullied online and in person when he was younger and all of it was happening at the same time. usually i never feel bad for rich people but i feel so bad for him :(

i’m so sorry justin :(

soy el único que vino por Habbo?



Meus Deus! Me lembro como se fosse ontem que esse clipe foi lançado em 2020,  e hoje já se passou 4 anos!!!

<a href="">2:53</a> that’s definitely Jeffrey Epstein

Nope after all the p diddy shit going down 

<a href="">2:18</a> what happened to bros mouth?



Ayam ayam ayam

Very sad  JB survivor

Very cool

All these child stars growing up to be “crazy” or disturbed” have seen the darkest of places of evil. My heart goes out to them all may they heal from what the industry has done to them.

I&#39;m 18 and started making music when I was 12 I hope to get there someday. Justin Bieber success story inspires my art. It was never easy.

I get it! Came here from the pizzagate comment! Wow!



Veo personas mayores como empresarios y veo la comida como gelatina  y veo niños. Pareciera que gente influyente explotará a niños y comen carne de humanos

Muy raro la cancion

You are crazy you hate your Fans I’m exposing you I’m

Could the clip then be a reference to certain billionaires who are involved in child trafficking?  It&#39;s explained why there are only children performing in the show, they don&#39;t seem happy.  Justin is very brave, many celebrities who want to unmask these groups are also.  The music is good, but I&#39;ll never listen to it the same way I did before!

Where the f is lyrics

I still remember this song. It was like a comeback. I remember when he sang it, he was suffering from problems in his life. I was sad at the time and happy at the same time. Happy because he released a new album that blew up the world, and sad because he was suffering alone from problems and I could not be with him. I hope you are well.  Justin, I am glad you are well. You deserve all the best

bro that music star has banned on conzert and he 100% cringe

When I was younger, I used to listen to it for hours

Famous as Hell 

Anyone understand the significance of all the peas?

2024🇧🇷

This isn’t too much

Minute <a href="">2:21</a> Justin&#39;s chin

Why same moves



I&#39;m enjoying this masterpiece, until i read the comments Like dude what is happening 



WHO TF STRETCHED JUSTINS JAW LIKE TF

Hellwood  is eating young souls  , promising them fame&amp; money ..      he feels empty &amp; lost after being used.  His marriage is a part of this all , a fake lifestyle.  He lost his real love &amp; nothing can compensate it ever, not a model, neither a church....

<a href="">2:20</a>

Who is watching it&#39; is 2024?

2024 

O justin quebrou a parede com esse clipe... hablou mesmo. Coitado deve ter visto cada coisa 

When someone understands the meaning of the song , What he means and what he wants to say 

ชอบมากครับ

That song that used junya1gou

Who&#39;s here in 2024?

B

U

I can&#39;t believe this got a Grammy nomination...

This clip about every detail jastin’s life about secret island (the island but rich old people American know about it)

What

çok zekice bir klip

Watching in 01 18 24

muito bom a música

Who here 2024?

2024 

¡ Vamos ahora, ricos! Llorad y aullad por las miserias que os vendrán. Vuestras riquezas están podridas, y Vuestras ropas están comidas de polilla. Vuestro oro y plata están enmohecidos; y su moho testificara contra vos otros, y devorara del todo... (santiago 1: 1-4) no nos preocupemos la sentencia viene.

What is this song of Justin Bieber?

2024, anyone??

If you know you know.

If you know, you know. Soon they will face the full force of the American Taxpayer.

his isn&#39;t just music; it&#39;s an emotion. It&#39;s that perfect soundtrack for both the highs and lows of life. Pure brilliance

Bro what is with the Pink hairHa Ha HaLove this song!Bro everything in moderation buddyI get itYour wife isBreakfast lunch dinnerHa Ha HaModeration broHa Ha Ha

Those who know can&#39;t sleep. This stuff is terrifying.

Alguém aqui é do brasil, deixa seu 

I love it so much

Thumbnail has changed, what could be the reason ?

Avicii exposed the pedo rings too with For A Better Day.. and he “died”. Praying for Justin, may he be protected. We truly love you Justin and you’re not alone, we stand with you, and we support you for speaking up. Sending you all the love in my heart. Thank you for doing this when no other “powerful” celebrity out there dares to speak up about. 

This is song listen on 2024 guys

So sad praying for all the victims of sex traffic.

A la gente que dice que fue un niño explotado por la Industria.No, se le dió un elección y el eligió y pagó sus consecuencias.Pudo haber dicho que no al dinero y a la fama, que no compran la felicidad como pueden ver ahora.

2m21 what a face .

I’m so surprised I haven’t seen anyone else sing the song

Tbm gosto demais dessa a vibe dela tbm sem comentários perfeita .

I came here to see if Justin&#39;s chin actually becomes discombobulated like in FutureCanoe&#39;s videos when he reacts to good food he makes

EX COELIS DILEAS GU BRATH 

Tim Biebs are YUMMMY

Who came here after hearing the yummy theory  from tiktok. I heard it for @Khalil |Storyteller

As a Canadian from Vancouver, feel my fav singer can&#39;t do have a feel good anywhere.I love all of his songs but this one&#39;s special! I&#39;ve loved it ever since I for the first time 2yrs listened this song. This song about it what he was going through as a child growing up. I&#39;m sorry this is dirty story but the song was deep touch to me and still I love it song. Thanks Justin.

I came here after the yummy theory and ellen show, now it makes sense about those gross food and a baby pic of himself

Las personas que salen ahí, con sus ropa extravagante y lujosa no son más que famosos , políticos, científicos , personas de alto poder que pactican la p3d0f1l1a y el abuso que salen en la Lista de Eipten , no es una historia conspirativa, es la realidad, por eso el vídeo se ve raro , la gente comiendo , lo peor es que como son gente de alto poder que se hace, NADA, siguen trabajando como si NADA , no pagan contra la ley

This video is creepy asf. Looks like all the elites around a table and he&#39;s the one being preyed upon. Everyone around thd table is older than he is and he&#39;s the only one who is in pink which symbolize him as being fertile or female.

I like song yummy so such

Tengo una teoríaQue esto esta vinculado con una red de niños ya que se muestra personas con dinero en un lugar lujoso comiendo primero y al final parece en el plato un niño pequeño...No se pero el lugar me recuerda a la casa blanca 

Gözlerim doldu. Her şey şimdi çok anlamlı. İyi ki varsın justin️

I love you justin

My walk up song

This is just so sad. . I never saw the video before or really listened to the lyrics. . Very sad. . Hope you are in a good place now 

Sinto muito Justin, esse clipe revela o lado n0jent0 da elite, dos poderosos! As crianças em volta fo clipe, TUDO faz sentido agora

I love you Justin

This is so sad

Yummy

This song is not about the food…

He does look uncomfortable but that’s just how I feel and something is off about this music video if you guys can’t tell

Who don&#39;t like yummy food?

What is the meaning of this song

Why pop star music videos can&#39;t be simple and normal?I fed up with all disturbing images and undercover messages...

2024年は、誰だ??

Isso faz muito sentido agr, no final escrito yummy no prato com a foto dele criança! Meu Deus, como não vi isso antes… e está lembrando tb quando ele era pequeno e foi cantar para Obama, lembram?

No pizza anymore

people on tiktok call this song lazy not at all

lol who seen that woman in <a href="">2:28</a> with a blood like stain on her lips

i knew it just wouldn&#39;t make no sense that bieber&#39;s first single in 5 good years would be &quot;yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy&quot;, i just wish we understood the messages earlier

you know what the craziest part about this video is??? in the BTS, he was found on the floor crying, literally balling his eyes out. the media really tried to portray him as the evil one lol.. the way he disappeared from hollywood for 4 years, came back as a christian and settled down tells you everything you need to know. it&#39;s obvious he wants nothing to do with the fame anymore.

him entering the room at the beginning shows him as an innocent young man and then he sits in the midst of the elites who deceived him, used and abused him. this is the story of 15 year old justin 13 years ago.. it&#39;s sad that no one was there to protect him, not even his mother. his father only came back into his life when he started making money

Pizza gate

Jeffrey Epstein 

I remember I watched this when it came out 2 years before I made this account

Essa

This is so sad

Who&#39;s here in 2024?

Just justing repping for the adrenochrome addicts in Pedowood.. Sick... Pics of babies all over his insta with the title &quot;yummy&quot;? wtf

Where is the FutureCanoe Gang?

Stallion 

Yummy 

770M 

Let’s go 



I’ll have to look the lyrics up as all I can make out is “got that yummy yum noises noises”.  I don’t understand why autotune is so overused.

<a href="">2:52</a> Jeff 

Here from tik tok

Who came here from the tik tok video?

Esta Hillary Clinton 

The dark girl is oppra

4 Rags hitting the air on the beat with the word face (book) <a href="">2:44</a>

Gençler oynuyor ve yaşlılar onlara bakıp eğleniyor

justin bieber, 1 of the greatest singers of all times, may God bless him and protect him,1 of the things am proud about, is that even though i am a male, but i never hated him since the baby song, while all other males my age, hated him, am glad i didn&#39;t make that mistake, plus, he&#39;s a pisces like me, but i am a february pisces, while he&#39;s a march pisces, that&#39;s the difference,

Met gala ,y demás premiaciones jjajaja ya saben lo que nos está contando

came to confirm that girl on tiktok. Sad bro

Justin!!! Stop eating children!

The down fall of Hollywood begins

WHO SEE IT IN 2024...?? GIVE A THUMBS-UP.. 



did anyone else notice the edits on his face at <a href="">2:17</a>. first it was eyebrows then jaw

Who&#39;s watching this in 2024?

If you could just Think and Avoid the word Pink. This track would be 

Lastima que Fue uno mas qué sufrio abusos, a cambio de dinero y fama. Ahora miren ? Famoso, y todo, &quot;dinero&quot; si es que se puede decir, pero al final tal vez con miles de problemas personales por dentro. Tengo todo &quot;material&quot; pero y mi esencia mi niñez la perdi, y todo es 50/50, al final no TIENE NADA! Lástima 

2023

I’d got that yummy sum that yummy yum that yummy yum that yummy yum that yummy yum that yummy yum that yummy yum

FuckShit

He is talking about Haleys edibleness down there

No puedo creer  que  prácticamente lo dice todo en esta canción esta vivo de puro milagro 

Come on Danny we all know its you

Now I understand the clip..

Hay que estar ciegos para no darnos cuenta toda lo que nos da entender en este video pobre Justin

El video arranca con 3 violines, sublime

Şimdi klibi daha iyi anlıyorum. Justin bize herşeyi anlatmış aslında

ඔව් ඔබ ඒක ගත්තා...රසායි රසායි

Song is about rich wealthy people using children for entertainment and gratification!!!All the older people in the videos were eating foods that were for children!!!And ADRENOCHROME!!!

Joya

Quem reparou que tinha uma mulher vestida de vermelho em uma cadeira atrás do Justin e dps no final a roupa dela estava na cadeira?

<a href="">02:19</a> - <a href="">02:22</a> bro&#39;s jaw is MOVING moving

I hate this song so much

Me dió escalofríos verlo en el plato de niño

Pedophiles are going to hell.

Aquí viendo el vídeo por primera vez porque en algún lado ví similitud  lo que pasaba en la isla 

恋童癖都快点去死

想到了爱泼斯坦…天呐

Cuando dice Jet , se refiere al avión privado de ya sabemos quién ??

The best music

Hello 2027 people:D.

2020 was 4year ago

<a href="">2:53</a> looks like epstein

Yummy yummy 

<a href="">2:35</a> - <a href="">2:36</a> Jeffrey Epstein ?

Y tambien se puede ver que a todos le dan gelatina, y la gelatina es colágeno wao...

<a href="">#Pizzagate</a>

Yostin eres el mejor

Agora eu entendi

Eso explica porque lo tenían drogado cuando joven

Who is listen this song in 2024

Ahora todo tiene sentido 

He’s been trying to tell us  this is so sad. No wonder this kid was troubled.

Zamanında Justin Bieber ifşa etti epstein meselesini ama kimse dikkate almadı

Denuncia a essa industria criminosa!

Nadie presto atencion a lo mínimo

Ulımınate  Justin Bieber 

He’s been trying to tell everyone!

Is that rly Justin beaver boy

La teoría ahora tiene sentido… que turbio…

Justin… 

This song is a call out on P Diddy. Since he groomed justin. Sick man.

Justin que te hicieron? Hablá por Dios! Ya no es necesario que escondas mensajes en canciones! La información viaja rapidísimo a través de las redes. Por favor  hablá! Todo esto es tan sucio e injusto, no soporto ver a un chico que nació para dar su luz a mucha gente esté triste por culpa de perversos de malditos psicópatas! Es muy importante que hagas arte, que inspires y escribas música, tenés el talento, tenés la luz..no hagas más giras! Usa sus herramientas a tu favor! Escribí la música que te salga del corazón

Justin 

Siz şarkıyla dalga geçmeye devam edin adam p*dofiliye dikkat çekmek için böyle şarkı ve klip yaptı izlerken mahvoluyorum  kim bilir nelere şahit oldu

Pra quem não esta entendendo, o Justin testemunhou uma vez as lamentáveis cenas do caso Epstein e vários famosos como Lady Gaga, Oprah, Hillary Clinton praticando sexo com pessoas traficadas e ped0fili4, Jeffrey ofereceu uma carreira homérica e ainda maior a Justin Bieber, featuring com as lendas de Hollywood como Jay-Z pra isso ele teria que no ritual de iniciação aceitar abusar de uma criança que foi apresentada a ele completamente drogada pra ele abusar e depois sacrificar, ele ficou mega horrorizado, traumatizado e rejeitou tudo aquilo.. como forma de expressão e de jogar aquilo pra fora pois estava consumindo a mente dele, ele fez esse clipe como forma de denuncia e pra por pra fora esse pesadelo nojento que ele presenciou nos bastidores de Hollywood.

This is the worst shite I&#39;ve ever  seen or heard. Is this what passes for music now? Mind boggling!

The thumbnail 

En el momento <a href="">2:19</a> vemos como la cara de Justin Bieber se deforma y lo cual da un grande parecido a Epstein 

Is this really about eating kids ?

I love my brother  4ever

<a href="">3:44</a>  damn Baby picture of himself , didn’t think years later he’d would exploited and take advantage of

769 MIL , LETS GET IT TO 800 MILL! POOR JUSTIN THOUGH 

bleketek miyomiyomiyomiyomgeblek geblek geblek ainin ainan eno enen geblek geblek geblekainin eniiin enon enen

Yall forgot JB was groomed SA&#39;d and got lots of hate when he was an upcoming singer

love and admire you very much

hola justin tenes menos plata que bad bunny????

Isla ️

MEU DEUS! Quando eu assisti esse clipe pela primeira vez, não tinha entendido absolutamente nada dele. Sempre achei estranho. Mas agora em 2024, depois desse escândalo do Epstein ter sido exposto, voltei aqui para assistir novamente e fiquei chocado. Principalmente com a cena final. Agora sim tudo faz sentido pra mim. Que horror!  Pobre Justin, a sua justiça vai chegar e esses canalhas vão pagar, um por um.

The last part of the video is scary :s

Quando lançou eu imaginava ser apenas uma música quente dedicada a sua esposa. Hoje, depois de saber sobre os casos de p3d0 e do abuso que Justin sofreu, esse clipe me causa uma sensação nada agradável. Porém, muito bem feito. Protejam nossas crianças

 la elite hace muchas cosas que nosotros no sabemos

Analisem o vídeo com muita atenção, ele tem muitas referências a Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Oprah e até Lady Gaga.

La cara a largada al <a href="">1:19</a> aque se deberá ?

SABEMOS QUE ESTA CANCIÓN ESTA SUBIDA HACE 4 AÑOS POR ESO YA NO PEGA CANCIONES DESDE HACE 4 AÑOS 

damn i dismissed this when i was younger but now i understand to some degree and it’s so sad

the way they distort his face randomly is so fucking creepy

This video brings me chills...I hope that every dark secret gets exposed

This song sounds like it&#39;s a party in my yummy!

Te amo Justin️

A foto dele criança no prato entregou tudo

I am here after Meatcanyon, it&#39;s hilarious

Adults are so disgusting. I went down the yummy rabbit hole and now I’m here. Just sad.

 Holy shit, I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that man.

lost control of myself, i&#39;m compromisedyoure incriminated- no disguise and you ain&#39;t ever running low on supplies

Beautiful boy 

Here because of tik tok

Vengo de tik tok...

Esa foto al final le dió sentido a toda la letra 

even in 2024 you still hear it

I’m sorry this happened to you 

Quería  ser escuchado y muchia lo ignoramos. Ahora sabemos.el.verdadero significado de la cancion

The way he dances  got me on the ground 

<a href="">2:51</a> era una referencia a Jefry Epstein?, lo digo por el parecido.

Real life Finnick Odair

Muy fuerte lo qe hay detras de esta musica.

Ha sido el único de la industria que lo a hecho,gran valor.El video impactante.

Why is he in all pink though? Pink napkins even his hair… what’s the meaning?

1. Lo invitaron a ese lugar de reunión 2. En su inocencia pensó que no pasaría nada,pero se percató que el ambiente estaba raro <a href="">3:51</a> <a href="">3:51</a>

This music video… makes absolutely no sense whatsoever

Yo ponia esa canción en mis historias cuando comia algo delicioso.

I can&#39;t believe this clown is still around.

justin bieber supremacy &gt;&gt;&gt;

This is fkd

Checaron que al final del vídeo cuando apagan las luces se queda solo con un hombre alguien me puede decir quién es ese hombre ?

Ariana grande nunca haría lo que hicieron esos infelices

todo lo que tuvo que pasar Justin el es muy fuerte

I’m sad about the meaning and truth behind 

Polémica 2024

Agora esse videoclipe faz TODO sentido, na época não entendi o episódio traumático que Justin tinha passado nos bastidores da indústria de Hollywood.

Quem mais veio pra ver a mensagem que Justin deixou nas entrelinhas denunciando o lado podre de Epstein e dos donos de Hollywood nesse clipe? ️ Justin foi grandão ai!

Free palestine

Danny gonzales’s yummy was better

¿Quién más está aquí por el caso de Epstein?

Quien mas vino x la isla de eipstein ?

viendo mas a detalle el video!.. los chicos que salen con el  se parecen mucho a Demi lovato,Taylor,selena,etc

Justin dio las señales y nadie lo entendió

Indirecta.... a jeffrey e_pst_ein....

Bem que lá por 2020 disseram sobre a teoria desse vídeo, agora que eu compreendi

justin dijo que esa musica era para su esposa hailey, no se que creer

Ave Christus Rex, Redemptor Mundi

<a href="">2:52</a>Epstein dando la voz

The Epstein list

After 4 year&#39;s we here

2024 anyone?

Greatest song in the universe 

Aquí los pandorianos que vinieron lor Sin️️

Alguien 2024

I heard that this song was all a metaphor for child molestation. What a P.O.S!!!

CAN THIS COMMENT GET 1K LIKES??? probs not

Diddy is the domino

Smfh so sad. You idiots are like oh this is a great song! So good! It’s literally him showing how them old ass holly wood people abused him and used him for sex and to get paid. The only person in the room at the end was an old man with him!!!!



Who is here in 2024

Anyone 2024?

Todo lo que habra sufrido 

Respeto &lt;3 gracias Justin por tu valentía

Al inicio una de las niñas lleva una prenda rosa brillante y al final del video se mira la prenda colgada en una de las estatuas,tiene tantos mensajes este video que es triste

No entendimos la denuncia de este video nosotros no pero la industria si y lo sacaron del juego 

People are woken to the nasty shit those wealthy elites do

Nossa os comentários dos brasileiros ‍️ sinceramente não entendem nada de interpretação visual! Da até vergonha alheia… pesquisemMais galera!

el plato con su rostro cuando era niño:(

Jefrey jefrey

Shoutout to JB for warning us with this cryptic video

<a href="">2:50</a> efftein. Justin sabe cosas que las elites trataran que no salgan mas cosas a la luz.

Después de 4 años todo tiene un sentido real en este video.

Can&#39;t Believe This Song is Already 4 years old Man time going Fast

depois de descobri pq o justin gravou isso fico assim

NO BRO EN ESA ISLA LO DETONARON.

2024?

Degenera2

Gay?

Yummy

Nice 

2024 Anyone??

Estudien muy bien el video hace mucha referencia a Bill Clinton,Hillary Clinton,Oprah y hasta lady gaga

2024 anyone

bro..

Nobody heard you Justin but karma exist and no ones can lie forever, all the truth is coming out. You are a survivor from there.

Me sorprende la cantidad de personas que a menos que algo se haga publico crean en los mensajes que varios artistas han dejado con el paso del tiempo. Bien dicen que podemos tener la verdad ante nuestros ojos  y aún así no querer verla.

JBYummy yummy 2024Love thisss Croatia 🇭🇷️

Im in canada

Lost control of myself, I&#39;m compromisedYou&#39;re incriminating, no disguiseAnd you ain&#39;t never runnin&#39; low on supplies 

Era mi canción favorita del 2020 sin saber que significa 

Pizza Gate 

️

If only this video has a better music to support its message

Estuve analizando y la mansión donde están, se parece a la mansión que compro Jeffrey Einstein en Palm Beach...full referencia xd

Todo tiene sentido y no me di cuenta

El video entero es una obra maestra que te habla del tráfico y consumo de infantes por parte de la red perversa de pedofilia wue se mueve en estados unidos, Justin fue sumamente valiente, siempre supe el transfondo de lo que quiso gritarle al mundo, me contenta saber que mas gente está abriendo los ojos, el mensaje final es, ¡cuiden a los niños!

Talking about sum exposing when he’s literally participating and knowing what’s going and if u don’t know his video shows pedophilia of lil boys and girls with the symbolism of pizza

Poor justin

What is yummy? Pizza? OMG!!!!

Que significa yumy yum

so is everyone suddenly realizing this video was about the whole epstein thing? you guys are so slow

La verdad que esta canción y vídeo musical tiene demasiado sentido ahora para mi, antes no la entendía. Pero ahora todo está más que claro!

Al final sale un señor comiéndose un pastel y es el mismo pastel dónde sale la foto de justin

Alguien mas se dio cuenta de que el entra y se sienta en la mesa y se empiezan a acercar las personas a sentarse con el 

You&#39;re a very strong man Justin Bieber  I&#39;m sorry what you had to go through you were so young God will fight your battle for you If you let Him.

2024

Alguien se dió cuenta que cambiaron la portada de este video como referencia a Oprah del caso Jeffry Epstein? ... Justin lo supo todo este tiempoDid anyone notice that they changed the cover of the video as a reference to Oprah about the Jeffry Epstein case? ...Justin knew this all along

mano, simplesmente toda vez q eu me aprofundo no contexto dessas musicas que parecem ser inocentes, sempre tem um contexto sombrio por trás, pqp

Justin gracias por denunciar tanta mierda en este siglo! Justin Free

Agora fiquei com dó do Justin por conta dessa indústria maldita.

This is gonna be a protests Justin against child abuse he stage the Epstein&#39;s party in that video he knew but he can&#39;t speak because they can eliminate him that way they did with MJ

En la teoria del pelo hay una teoria que si te pintas el pelo de rosa es que has sido abusado

Siento tanto que hayas pasado por esto justin, ojala ya hayas podido salir del control de esos asquerosos.

The autotune just got ridiculous

He knows

Ahora todo tiene sentido 

One of the best songs of Justin Bieber , everything the melody the lyrics the whole video , and the meaning behind.

2024someone?

<a href="">2:09</a> OPRAH

Justin sabía cosas y nadie lo escucho ahora de qué salió el tema de la isla todo tiene sentido

JAJAJAJAJA, cada que el tema de pedofilia se vuelve tendencia vienen a deducir cosas y que &quot;abrieron los ojos&quot; pero al mes ya todos olvidaron el tema.Paso en 2020 con pizzagate.Me parece paso en 2022 con Anonymous.Y ahora en 2024 con la lista de Epstein.Siempre pasa lo mismo y nadie hace nada.

Fuerza Justin 

Después de ver tantas teorias sobre esta canción, ya no la puedo ver de la misma manera



SIEMPRE TUVO RAZON

Broo

Now I&#39;m realising what things he was exclaimedyummy for

i always knew this videos deeper meaning but i’m glad more people are understanding it

Fue un niño explotado por la industria y todavía tuvo el odio injustificado por la sociedad muchísimos años! Justin es una persona muy fuerte. 

So basically...he performed for a group of old people everyone knew what was up and when he was done they ate his innocence...who came here after that one tiktok?

Nomas se sienta y lo rodean puros adultos y viejos

Estoy aquí por lo que esta pasando en el mundo sobre la isla y la trata de infantes 

justin is to be respected and admired tbh. ️

Hello

como veo este video sin sentirme triste por cada niño que ha vivido eso

Who are here for the yummy island 

Incluso al final en el piso parece como si quisiera representar la medalla/ collar que dió Obama...

<a href="">#pizza</a> get

Who noticed delaney glazer was one of the dancers ️️️

Oigan la morena que sale en la mesa con justin no hará referencia a Oprah? No lo se digo yo

que huevos los de justin no tuvo miedo

turbio

Yo viniendo de tiktok  a ver si ese gato tiene ese  collar

<a href="">2:52</a> epstein

Esta subiendo las reproducción sera por el caso de JE

Funny how no one noticed the Jeffery Epstein look alike @<a href="">2:54</a>

Recuerdo a ver visto esta canción años atras, cuando estaba todo el revuelo de epstein.muchos salieron a decir que esta canción era una más de justin y que no tenia ninguna relación, pero hombre... no hay que ser tan observador como para ver que el video no tiene sentido, esta bien hecho y quiere mostarar lo que ya todos sabemos, y fue hasta hace dias que ya gran parte de esa gente que no creyo, ahora lo hace. Hace que este video sea un mas perturbador e increible.y segun muchos dijeron que justin comentoque el video no tiene relevancia con epstein, pero obvio no iba a salir a decir que lo tenía

if you think this song and music video is a critique on hollywood pedophilia you have schizophreniaalso while we’re at it trying to theorise about someone’s potential sexual assault is fucking lunacy

De pensar que toda esa comida e para niños y puros viejos o señores lo comen

Te amo justin 

Pobres niños almas inocentes en el mundo 

I feel like if he truly wanted to expose, he’d be serving pizza and hotdogs… not jello n lobster haha

Vengo despues de 4 años que la escucho y porfin entiendo el video mucha referencia a esa isla

The ending being a pic of his younger self on a plate? Chilling



Omg 2024️️

Who’s here after the tik tok

Creepy, hope he heals 

Después de ver lo de la isla de Epstein.... Ahora este video toma sentido

Can&#39;t believe Changes album released 4 years ago feels like yesterday 

Siempre supe que esta cancion tenia algo oculto

Who’s here after seeing Katlyn’s tiktok?

Old people…young kids? Free Palestine

The old people are so creepy

Fuckin Cannibals

I wish I could protect him

who is here after the epstein list

so basically Justin has been on the menu since he came onto the scene as a child, and anyone who could afford it got a taste. All while lining his pockets handsomely to watch him entertain them into oblivion. Makes sense why he and many others dove deep into substance abuse and whatnot for years. Not excusing anything, just noticing. i also noticed the only person left /dining/ at the end was an assumedly j-ewish older male....

Cuando se sube a la mesa interpreto su coreografía como si diera señales con las manos , también me pareció que dió el giro muy conocido de Michael Jackson como apollo a el a parte de que Justin se inspira en el y siempre fue su fans .

He looks so angry in this video

Exposed in 2024!!!Protect our children.

Claramente veo ahí a oprha 

Omg esta más que claro el mensaje 

How many children and women have been traumatized or d*ad because of a person/men needing to get that bust.

Ah, ahora sí se confirma, yo ya entender

I think all the theories and messages got undermined because ppl were too busy hating on this. It’s a catchy tune and he was smart for a sec

ISLA

ahora de ver lo de la lista este video tiene mucho sentido 

Justin is a Survivor, i admire and respect him so much, as a person, the great entertainer that he is and for raise his voice about all the industry did to him as a kid, King JB FOREVER 

<a href="">#Pizzagate</a>, todos tienen que caer

My god this video makes my core rattle. I hope 2024 is the year everything is finally exposed

 aww Justin we didn’t know

Who’s here after Katt Williams interview talking about p diddy

Ahora todo tiene sentido 

esta canción esconde muchas cosas escondidas

ahora entendi todo esto gracias justin biber el desgrasiado caso de esas listas y de famosos tonto pudiendo saber todo lo que an hecho todo esta en twiter

ahora tiene sentido

F

You dont need to be in the elite when the same thing happens to you in your own family enviroment. They in every where.....

Referencias de las god

Well well well

Este video ya se sabía de que hablaba es que somos ciegos hasta que el control te dice que es verdad. Despierta

 gente, no es loco q justo la fecha de la filtración de los nombres en la lista de Epstein acá en la redes, es la misma q el día q se subió este video allá a principios del 2020? 

Es impresionante que después de 4 años no lo hayan desaparecido y espero no lo hagan 



Es totalmente claro el mensaje de Justin Bieber, la exhibición de toda la Pedofilia en la Industria de la Música; Sin duda me queda claro que los que se sientan con El en la mesa hace referencia a Jhon Podesta ex coordinador de campaña presidencial en 2016 de Hillary Clinton donde además aparece una mujer que hace referencia a ella.

Wn como que 4 años 

Y el de Rosalía  el vídeo

Hay una señora afrodescendiente, un señor de cabello blanco en terno ...Mmmmm muy sospechoso

Ahora todo toma sentido.

Oh my God this song started to scare!!

Bien a escucharla por el caso de la isla .

2024... Y esto se pone cada vez más turbio

What happened to his chin <a href="">2:21</a>

AHORA ESTO TOMA SENTIDO

Ahora entiendo porque esos niños aparecen como los que están tocando con el violín  y los demás instrumentos. 

Ahora todo tiene sentido

:

J&#39;ai compris maintenant 

It&#39;s weird how when you listen to the song, you think it&#39;s a sexual song towards your partner. But why is there all old people in the music video.

 yo vengo por tiktok ahora todo cobra sentido

AHORA ESTO TOMA SENTIDO

TU SABÍAS MUCHAS COSAS JUSTIN!

Jefrey jefrey &quot; XD

Tu y yo sabemos perfectamente porque estás aquí 

<a href="">0:13</a> Justin llega, se ve a niños tocando, pueda dar referencia a qué están a su merced.- <a href="">0:20</a> cuando Justin se sienta todos los que lo rodean le miran y se acerca, algunos de los que alcance a reconocer el Jhon Podesta.Los que están en la mesa con justin le ofrecen comida , luego en los minutos - <a href="">2:18</a> y <a href="">2:21</a> aparece con los ojos deformados e igual la quijada, dando a entender que a sido drogado.- <a href="">1:49</a> &quot; perdí el control de mi mismo, estoy en peligro &quot; claramente referencia a qué está siendo controlado y manipulado y probablemente amenazado.- <a href="">1:40</a> estás incrimado sin disfraz, es decir que abusan de los niños siendo ellos mismos mejor mostrándose ellos sin ninguna mascara.- <a href="">2:01</a> esta parte también es importante, el chico se ve tranquilo y aburrido, pero comiendo.Luego de unos minutos se empieza a mover también dando a entender que vaba sido drogado.- <a href="">2:10</a> que asco solo imaginense que lo que comen son niños que han sido ofrecidos para ellos.<a href="">3:20</a> todos drogados<a href="">3:40</a> Es claro, Justin se queda solo con &quot; Jhon Podesta y su ex manager &quot; puede ser que ellos fueron los que lo violaron, ya que el ex manager fue acusado de abuso sexual mucho antes estaba aleg mucho a Justin diciendo que&quot; era hermoso como solo una mujer podía serlo&quot; que horror- <a href="">3:45</a> la última del pastel, clarísimo que fue el postre de estos imbéciles

:(

&quot;Las mentiras nunca duran por siempre, esa es la verdad&quot;

Justice for Avicci, Paul Walker, Chester Bennington, ChrisCornell, Anne Heche and Kurt Cobain for exposing the pedophiles

Qui est venu comme moi regarder le clip pour le complot pizza....

 now we know

4 ans

vine por el xokas

En ese vídeo salen la mayoría de los que fueron a la ISLA de Epstein.. dan ascoo! JHON PODESTA ES EL PRIMERO

Pizza gate

Vuelvo aquí cada que se revela una verdad de la industria

Ahora si  están escuchando ehhh 

todo tiene sentido

Un visionario

Vengo despues que se ha &quot;liberado&quot; la lista de los visitantes a la Little Island Saint Jane de Jeffrey Epstein. Si algo le pasa a Justin Bieber, es as3s1n4t0, no su1c1d10.

La lista de Epstein

Came here after tik tok theories - so sad

Referencias de la lista Epstein por todos lados

Perdoname por todo Justin Bieber

Also... when your sandwich was facing you it was a cute little red cherry , why once your sandwich was turned around its black af?? What you telling me Justin 

Desde que vi este video, cambió mi forma de ver a Justin, de un niño cualquiera de la industria, a un hombre que alzó la voz...

Anyone in 2024?

Oh Justin. Why was your baby picture on the plate ? Makes me wonder

Luego de ver todos los cometarios, veo que Bieber se habra decepcionado de que mas de un fan no entendiera el mensaje oculto, eso me hace ver superior a todos ellos , y eso que yo lo det3staba, pero esta cancion fue su redencion y ahora para mi es un heroe, esto significa que la industria artisitica tiene muy bien controlada a las masas

Justin, discúlpanos por no tomarlo en serio .

La elite es muy poderosa Los iluminatis abusan de los niños sirviendo comidas a los adulto que salen ahí en el video muy raro

Pizza 

Idk why but I used to sing this before it got realised by a year or so and i didn’t even know this song was there

Ahora todo tiene sentido  que asco de mundo la verdad

 pobre Justin

Vine a ver si de verdad cambiaron la miniatura , increíble lo que está pasando, ojalá los americanos no se queden sin hacer nada

Tròn 4 năm siêu hit ngon ngon ra mắt nhanh vcl

Alguien 2024 después de que saliera la lista de Jeffrey  Epstein

el cambio de la miniatura... será una referencia a los nombres de conocidos dados recientemente en la lista de Jeffrey Epstein? 



Un grande Justin

Cambiaron la miniatura



Justin Bieber was trying to warn us about child trafficking and Epstein!<a href="">#SoundofFreedom</a>

is the new frame looking like Oprah?

After Epstein list, make sense 

Jeffrey Epstein hause

<a href="">#pizzagate</a>

:(

Notice how at <a href="">2:40</a> all the young female dancers are wearing white? The colour white is known to be symbolic of innocence, purity, cleanliness. Them dancing with the other regular male party goers who are wearing colourful clothing is representative of how rich, powerful and high-profile men would take the innocence of these high-profile young women. Justin just sits there and sings as this goes on, this is representative of how he and other people KNOW whats going on, but nothing can be done to stop it. After, Justin takes his hoodie off and starts dancing with them, showing how he is included in this but at the end he is left all alone, the place is deserted <a href="">3:33</a> . His body language is defensive (crossing his arms) and we see a young picture of him on a plate. He is showing how he feels (uncomfortable) and this hints to him possibly being abused and other children.I wrote this quickly so I&#39;m sorry if some things are not very clear or i missed some details, as I really wanted to get this out.Other things i noticed- Pink napkins are significant in this video, <a href="">1:10</a> <a href="">1:21</a> <a href="">1:31</a> <a href="">2:23</a> <a href="">2:30</a> <a href="">2:37</a> <a href="">2:44</a> <a href="">3:35</a>- His eyebrows and then jaw become distorted and un-human like at around <a href="">2:18</a>- The lighting goes dark blue when they start dancing around <a href="">2:40</a>

After the famous events, I looked at this clip differently

Justin, I’m sorry for what that twisted industry did to you

Quién de 2024 después de ver la lista¿?

Cada vez esta canción toma mas sentido hacia la pedofilia tiene un mensaje oculto

Y ahora con la lista de la isla del terror de Jeffrey Epstein podemos ver qué Justin siempre quiso advertirlo

I can’t believe I’ve never watched this video before. Weird. Song is weird

Quien vino por lo de la isla??

En twitter dicen que cambiaron la miniatura a una mujer parecida a Oprah ahora que salió la lista de Epstein

This is sick

Justin nos avisaste desde hace mucho de pizagatee de la isla de jefrein epstein

Uy! Ahorita con la lista que salió vaya que les queda esa canción...

the end 

The band being children performing for these old people. And the plate at the end with a picture of himself when he was little is just saying it all. It’s a disgusting world we live in that’s for sure.

Uff que fuerte, aquí se explica lo de esa isla asquerosa con esos pedófilos

Watching this, with all the drama going now rn (iykyk) just makes me sick somehow...

Epstein?

Sentí que nuestro chico quiso decir muchas cosas con este video, da escalofríos ver la porción de torta al final desapareciendo, y queda la imagen de Justin siendo niño  y el color rosa en su outfit  No sé si estoy últimamente muy delulu con lo que está pasando precisamente hoy 

Who are here for the Oprah miniature 

Who came here after the TikTok

Vengo por la miniatura de oprah

This is my first time seeing and hearing this song but I think that the video should have been more of a sexy vibe than about him sitting at a restaurant with some strangers. Sure it shows food but this song is far from what it is really talking about. My thing is a video should match with the song. Other than that the song is fire.

la LIsta la Lista!!!!

Aquí estoy de nuevo después de la lista del Jeffrey epstein. Grande Justin Bieber y Michael Jackson que se atrevieron a exponer esto.

Después de la lista de Jeffry Epstein tiene sentido el vídeo

The real message Justin was trying to send is the problem with the sick bastard pedos on the industry.

La miniatura del video fue cambiada??

Podrian ser Epstein, George Lucas, John Podesta, Oprah

Aquí estamos viendo si realmente cambio la miniatura 

<a href="">#Pizzagate</a>

Vine por las teorías de Jeffrey Epstein

Pizzagate...

Jeffrey Epstein brought me here

Ahora empiezo a entender cosas

O comentário em português que você estava procurando  (:

hoy toma mas importancia esta canción alv

It&#39;s been four years and it&#39;s still very good.

Todo tiene sentido...

ahhhhhh ahora todo tiene sentido.

Todo esto tiene que ver el lo sabe

AHORA ESTO TOMA SENTIDO

Y nadie le hizo caso...

Yo después de ver la lista de famosos que fueron a la isla de jeffrey hahahaha

Pizzagate ???

He looks like the goalie for the women&#39;s Olympic soccer team

Al final del video aparece el vestido de la niña de rojo en uno de los asientos 

️️️Who&#39;s here after Epstein&#39;s list?There is an assumption that as a child, Justin Bieber visited the island of pedophiles. The clip &quot;Yummy&quot; has references where rich old people filthily consume food that children bring them. And at the end we see a childhood photo of the singer on a dirty saucer

All these music videos with clear as day messages, just like aviciis. It made sense then and certainly does now.

<a href="">1:56</a>. Intentional video. Blood on the knife… Ask yourself why they made it look like that.

Justin saying he compromised out of fear or money “keep me on the (the sexual acts or crimes could be done for the promise of constant fame &amp; money) rise, lost control of myself, I&#39;m compromised”“You&#39;re incriminating, no disguise” and you ain&#39;t never runnin&#39; low on (money &amp; drugs,etc) supplies. “Say the (morning or night he has to answer to the strangers needs.) word, on my wayYeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe in the mornin&#39; or the latesay the word, on my way”“Hop in the Lambo&#39;, I&#39;m on my way drew House slippers on with a smile on my face”“Light a match, get (He has to get drunk &amp; do drugs before he can do all the evil things that’s asked of him… He get paid well &amp; can fly on private jets) litty, babe that jet set, watch the sunset”He doesn’t get the money all to himself (“Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it hundred racks, help me spend it”) though. Because he doesn’t do the acts alone. Or he’s saying they group up &amp; all share his body 50/50Sad song. 2024

It won&#39;t surprise me if something happens to Bieber, like it happened to Michael, Chester, Avicii and Chris Cornell, whatever happens to him and even if I was never his fan, Justin Bieber was a hero like the ones I previously mentioned.

Alguien más vino por el cambio en la miniatura?



Cuando se lanzó el clip fue de avanzada.Ahi me enteré del pizzagate

Alguien más vino aquí después de la última noticia con respecto al caso Epstein?

Here in 2024 after the infamous list came out. Wish we could’ve picked up more on the hintful messages when this first came out.

Song gones 4 years

Alguien vino por la lista de Jeffrey?

Vaya después de ver la lista me hace pensar

Il fait passer un messages a travers de la video

i’m here after the tiktok rabbit hole.

Can’t believe this song is 4 years old now. How time flies. Appreciate this greatness while he still here

<a href="">2:02</a> Oprah?

Venir al video después de que salgan los documentos del caso de Jeffrey Epstein refuerza la teoría de que la canción es sobre el pizzagate. Bien ahí Justin exponiendo de una forma sutilmente

all in Italy detest Grandr Bellezza i say strait away its oscar film i met people populating that movie myself

Um dia vou gravar com vc

My heart breaks for J.B.  He was literally served up on a plate to these monsters.  It gets better, it did for me.  I took my power back, because it wasn’t my fault.  Whether it’s a corrupt industry, a corrupt family member or any adult for that matter.  Our story needs to be told, so we don’t keep reliving that trauma.  I wish everyone dealing with S.A. peace and healing.
