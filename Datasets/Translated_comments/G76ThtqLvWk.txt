Dom can have zero horsepower and it wouldn&#39;t make a difference if they all pull in opposite directions

Fun fast and furios nice super
Imagine if there&#39;s Brian in the middle of all this

Wouldn&#39;t it be easier if they could block him by slamming their cars into his car

<a href="">1:45</a> Tej: &quot;Try 3000&quot;Shaw: &quot;Try 5&quot;Dom: &quot;Try FAMILY&quot;

movie name?
Did nobody think of idk taking out those round things beneath Dom&#39;s car?

When it comes to street fighting, the street always wins.

Can we just talk about how absolutely braindead the 2, 3 and 5 thousand horsepower dialogue is? For a film that has a heavy focus on cars, this is just ridiculously stupid.

<a href="">1:44</a> Electric cars in 20 years. Tesla Plaid who cares...

That’s a good advertisement for dodge

Imagine seeing this in ny as a normal thing <a href="">1:31</a>

Never turn your back on family.

this became a comedy series for mechanics. &quot;try 5&quot; I&#39;m weak
bentley,chevrolet,mercedes,jaguar,duty truck you harpooned dom&#39;s plymouth whats wrong with you

F1 car over 1000 BHP. Toretto&#39;s car over 5000... LOGIC
I'm a woman who's not really sure for you..I'm open..
How much money do you take from me? I work in exchange for money to take care of my children.. You bar hosts spin drugs and slots.. I get 7-8 hundred a day's wages. They borrow daily. My cock.. When I don't want to be a bad person myself.. Yes, I'm a bad person like you never thought of before.. I'm a mother who has to raise and care for my children, not you, you bastards.. remember that..
I'm telling you, you're so beautiful...you're so beautiful..you..don't mess with me..you..
You beautiful lady..you
5000hp? What is it? A stealth bomber lol

Is funny how they think the could take out dom is funny how the rock was saying u better have about 2000 horse power is cuz he knew that dom was gonna get away with it and on top of that is crazy how they was holding him dom still managed a way to get out from  it.

Movie name
What they didnt know was that dom had specialized STEEL, he had actually poured some of his sweat and taken 2 chain links out from his necklace to bond w the high strenth steel, .so it basically turned it into DOM-BRANIUM.....people say its stronger than CAPTAIN AMERICAS SHIELD.....

Since when did Don get Hulk like strength? Head butt a door and it flies off the hinges! Lol

some shii i do on a friday afternoon

Hi

What car is Jason Statham/Deckard Shaw driving? I know it&#39;s a Jaguar but I don&#39;t know the model.

His own family

If only they had one of those EMP harpoons from 2 Fast 2 Furious.

No one gonna talk about how a car with 5000 hp would be pretty much undriveable?No braking system in the world would be able to stop his car, and just idling his car would have him either tearing his car apart via torque or idling at like 60mph?????

Which part is this scene from?
&quot;Stop working on it and do it.&quot;Thanks for the advice.

*Physics has left the chat

the rock

Can anyone explain to me how the tires or those vehicles didn&#39;t explode or melt??

why did they harpoon the car

Dom is bad in this episode

<a href="">1:42</a> you mean &quot;we have a 2000 TORQUE on that thing&quot;

this is for 12 year olds.

6 year old me playing with my hot wheels:

I love how with the power of Family, he became a Family, to beat his own Family

<a href="">2:23</a> Gotta give dom credit using the cars behind him as power to drag Romans car.

Came here for a good, laugh, did notdisappoint…… Man Fast and the Furiousreally fell from grace since the sixmovie that was my favorite one smh

Epic moment dom is king of cars in faf.1. Dom ( king of cars ) 2. Brian ( king of run )3. D.K  /  Sean ( king of drift )

You know, these idiots could&#39;ve shot out Dom&#39;s engine block with a 20 mm AP shell or sprayed the car with corrosive acid....but this is F&amp;F. No one&#39;s that smart.

I like that Dom isnt driving a Charger in this scene, its a Plymouth GTX which is out of character for Dom, its nice to see him drive different branded cars every once in a while.

Guy,wow nice!
I love how the people around the scene just go about their business 

So we’re not gonna talk about how dom literally popped off his door with his elbow like bruh 

Did he just break a car door with his shoulder

Reminds me of that one scene from Hitman Agent 47

Love how he gives the door a nudge and it comes off flying towards the rock 

Did anyone ever play that Action Man game where you pretty much just drove around doing this exact thing? pretty sure I&#39;m not imagining that that game existed.

<a href="">2:38</a>break the door car

<a href="">2:27</a>kkkkk

Roman Pearce saying “No no no no, it’s my Bentley” at <a href="">2:17</a> makes me laugh every time 

Physics: &quot;Alright, I&#39;m gonna head out, you kids be good!&quot;<b>The Kids</b>

&quot;Its a family thing&quot;

How did fast and furious go from racing and drifting all the way to international spies, and space flight

Here before viral 
Looks like his power is over 9000.

Dom: screw the rules i have family

Kno It&#39;s my bently

The real victim here is roman bentley

YOUTUBE MANAGEMENT YOU ARE NOT NORMAL. AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH VIDEO, AT LEAST 3 ADVERTISEMENTS FORCEDLY WATCHED AND AT LEAST 3 ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE VIDEO MAY GOD GIVE YOUR MANAGEMENT A THOUSANDS OF TROUBLES SO THAT YOU SHALL SHALL AS YOU COME. HORRIBLE HOLES

Very strong fuck, he dismantled the entire car, it was a lot of fun.
Try 6 try 7 try 8 try 20

Try 5

<a href="">1:48</a> Power of Family

This I was laughing because it was soo fake it’s unreal 

Good part of the movie

No matter the horse power or the tork, only matter the Family and its power 

just wanna say to  believe in Jesus for he loves u so much that he died and was raised from the dead so that u can have a relationship with him. Believe in him and ask GOD for forgiveness of your sins :) and turn away from them as well (repent)...

Is it just me or at <a href="">1:56</a> when they show Letty&#39;s car her wheels are spinning as if in drive and not reverse?

<a href="">1:30</a> they pulled one car in different direction and they question why the car has so much horsepower

Actually, how many horsepower does Dom's car have?
They could have sandwiched dom from all sides and put in handbrake. Easy.

Dom should go against the hot wheels and Disney Pixar cars and transformers but at the end of the day he’ll win because he got family

This is Dom's power.
Just elbows a car door off

Those are some small wheels for 5000HP LOL

I know it’s sad that Dominic how to turn like that. But funny when Roman said no no not my baby ahhhhhh

can&#39;t take my eyes off the passerbys casually walk by

Roman: no no no it&#39;s my Bentley 
welcome back to bottom gear m8s, tonight ....

By pulling in opposite directions the vehicles are working against each other 

Impossible! How could Dom do that in this 8th Fast and Furious film?!!!

Rocks car alone would of kept him

Comments kill me more than logic

5000hp lmao

Get it, I am you&#39;re &quot;brother&quot;

Now** Dom it&#39;s Jacob.

Dom&#39;s Charger is made of vibranium...

Cool but dumb scene. They could&#39;ve just boxed him instead of doing that.

That Bentley alone weights more then that Plymouth Gtx and it wouldnt matter if he had 5k hp he would just sit there an spin, god these movies should have ended with Paul

Without context, this scene makes no sense though I&#39;m not sure if having context would help at all

I’ve only ever watched the first 3 F&amp;F movies and therefore knew these as racing movies, but I’ve now also seen a couple clips on YT of more recent ones. Sooooo, they’re harpooning cars and fighting guys who are robots now…?

Isn’t dom’s car 8000hp?
Watching these clips after quiting fast and furious series since tokyo drift is so weirdly funny. Like wtf is going on.

Physics is operated by Dom

<b>Cop pulls Dom over</b>Cop: You were doing 120 In a 65, what’s the rush pal? Dom: I got family.Cop: uhhhh okay but that still doesn’t answer my-Dom: that device you used to track my speed, look at it again<b>Cop looks at radar. There’s a picture of a mom, dad, and three kids</b>Cop: what the hell that doesn’t even make-Dom: that phone call you’re gonna get in 3-2-1..<b>cop’s phone rings</b> Cops wife: hey when are you getting off babe, the whole Family is here <b>Cop gets off the phone, still shaken up</b>Dom: Cop: …Cop: you’re free to go Sir

Dom playing poker: “I see your call for 200k, and I’ll raise to 5 families”

Fun fact, Greta actually owns Dom&#39;s car and did all the stunt driving.

I wonder if anyone could&#39;ve shot the tires while they were holding onto Dom like he was driving a 5000000 hp alien space shuttle about to teleport into space.

&quot;Try 5&quot;This single scene sums out how stupid Fast and Furious has become

Double alfa is actually helping Dom to get rid of harpoons by pulling him forward

Remeber when Dom was a (almost) normal human being and crashed his dad&#39;s Charger because he was distracted?

<a href="">2:44</a> You can see Dom shifts to family gear. Love that custom gear.

Did this man just shoulder bump a car door completely off

RIP PnB Rock

I already want to leave
<a href="">1:50</a>

Dom

This whole scene is cringe 

So do movies just hate the audience now?

Those poor cars 
It&#39;s like hunters capturing a beast

thats a cute car :D

How many gears does that car have?!

Who needs physics when you have a family

Its so fake   that truck would off ripped that charger to shreds and that bentley would have tanked the ram and outpowered him lol, bentleys are heavy af, never understood these films but I still enjoy them

Fun fact: those switches Dom flicked turned off the physics

yes

Fast and furious has turned into a avengers movie

<a href="">1:50</a> &quot;Try five.&quot; I just love some of Jason Statham&#39;s lines.

I love how the parts of the dodge doesn&#39;t care on the pull given by other cars

OK, at some point Dom’s tires would’ve had to gone out as much time as he burned out

just harpoon him from every direction, and make sure he is not going anywhere..... for what? to show off tire burning out? to show us how stupid the team without torreto?why not just shot harpoons from 1 direction and drag him with 5 cars to where ever they want? even better, why not just shot the tire and he will go fast and furious on foot

M15+ action violence and coarse language

The girl has a mitsuka rock star

i have never watched any of the F&amp;F movies... well i believe i saw Tokyo Drift when i was young, but when i first saw this scene... especially when that... Bentley? had the Harppoon launcher on the top of the car, i knew it would have the worst day... XD cause seriously who has a Launcher on top of something unless they designed the thing to work with said launcher

&quot;No, no, no, no, this my Bentley!&quot; OMG, Roman 

Average Ohio street
It’s actually my dream car

That Mercedes gt is stunning

Roman: No, no, no, no! It&#39;s my Bently! 

In reality, the harpoon would simply tear the metal of the car and fall out...
This movie was like a fever dream

The Fast and the Furious movies, where the main characters, even Paul Walker&#39;s character, don&#39;t care about collateral damage, or others getting killed.

A yes 2000/3000hp in a V8

Why didn’t they just aim for his tires ?

Changer with russian tank engine ️

Anyone know the name of the red car...?

<a href="">2:50</a>

DODGE IS GOD&#39;S CAR!!!!!!!!

Isaac Newton would withdraw from science and become a bartender if he sees this movie

<a href="">2:38</a> he gains super powers and can break the door by a nudge and angry face 

Honestly how did this movie franchise sink so low?

How can a door knock over a truck

They couldn’t use spikes ? Or even tranquillise him ?

 Adding more horsepower,  so a situation with zero traction is really going to help, 3,000 horsepower. You&#39;d probably actually be better off in a 1.6 Honda civic manual. To feel out the traction.
Why all this action all what they have to do is keep chasing dom until his car run out of fuel

Imagine if Brian comes to stop Dom

Can&#39;t believe this was released 5 years ago.

i wonder if hobbs using bobcat excavator instead jeep
The charger is just so badass

And this is why I hate fast and furious lol

Dom Toretto
<a href="">2:37</a> Hobbs truck couldn&#39;t pull that door but Dom&#39;s left elbow did the job.

Most realistic Fast and the Furious scene:

Car burnouts
Wow that door packs a punch <a href="">2:38</a>

They act soooo Bad WTF 

Most cars have Race mode But not in Dom’s case he has “Family Mode” Instantly Makes your car break the laws of physics

I don&#39;t know that Bollywood director directed this movie

Lmao what even is this?

<a href="">0:03</a>-<a href="">0:04</a>-<a href="">0:10</a>

0 rev matching. Unrealistic

wow

Weird that they deleted the scene where he kicks de passenger’s door to get rid of shaw

Love how the people still casually walk around like nothing’s happening.

Why did they even use bentley in street racing

Now that what i call &quot;dodge&quot;

It&#39;s fast and furious not fate and furious

So apparently police just don&#39;t exist anymore. Dom and crew have complete impunity to street laws

To be honest, i only liked this because of the cuda, especially the sound of the roaring v8

<a href="">2:17</a>

<a href="">1:48</a> <a href="">1:56</a>The promotion for Hot Wheels cars lol

What is dom’s car name ?

this movie is really beyond ridiculous even if you try to watch it as a action movie for fun

Modern muscle cars lack torque, that roadrunner was all motor baby

2005️️
Fun Fact: it&#39;s a &quot;Plymouth GTX&quot; not a charger

Stolen from Hitman (2015) movie ️

<a href="">2:23</a>

Which f and f is this in

The fat faulty decimal conceivably whirl because grandmother happily fix versus a aware exhaust. auspicious, quaint dad

<a href="">0:11</a>

sombody just walkin and they see this?

They could have shot the tires

8,000lbs truck and like 1,500 he can’t pull the door off but don’t can nudge it off lmao

Plymouth V8 just built like that

Physics be like....&quot;am i a joke to you ?&quot;

When they harpoon Don’s car, they’re pulling!! They’re pulling hard!! They have a good horsepower grip!!

Aint no way the 8th one came out 5 years ago. Wtf

The Fart of the Furious

Dom&#39;s car is screaming with lots of power I love this part.

POV: My Tryhard friends when I 6v1 them and still win lol

Funny how the people didn&#39;t run when they saw the gun but waited till he shot it...they really think he bluffing?

We&#39;ve concluded from this clip that dom&#39;s car is invulnerable considering that it got pulled by 4 ton truck and 4 others cars with over 400 hp.

some bullshit

F is for furious since he lost his Fate

My holy moly people would like a rock and I don’t leg rub your rock is so dumb rocket dummy Rocosa the rescue no Rocket a boat rockers do you wanna watch

Holy moly day everybody tell me the tell me the er so dumb

Guys rock is calling me in a messenger rock and sake calling me

Oh my god girl that’s rock rock rock is not even sure it’ll

Thanos used infinity stones to destroy infinity stones..Same Dom used Power of family to defeat family.

ONE OF THE GREATEST SCENES I&#39;VE SEEN


It’s crazy that he can probably handle 6 cars

I love how Hobbs 3 ton truck failed to rip off the door, but one push from Dom threw it off

&quot;NO&quot; &quot; N O O O &quot;
The bemper really strong 

You’d think they have installed, idk, like 3 or more harpoons that could attach to different spots on the car since he drove a military PICKUP truck but you know

Dumb movie, but I can&#39;t get over how beautiful Plymouth GTX is.

Those car doors are stronger than my futureEdit: just saw Dom elbow the door and it went flying. His elbow is more powerful than my will to liveEdit: Those axle bearing are weaker than my love for God

spread the gospel before its to late God and Jesus are real and there coming back soon go to church and receive the gift of God repent as well Amen spread this message ️

Bro these movies literally don’t make sense anymore

No more like lance Armstrong urine

Background extras are something, you have 5 cars wrangling a car and there are people casually walking, not stopping and watching not running, just a casual walk

<a href="">2:44</a> bro got family gear wtf 

Lmao 5000 horsepower.
<a href="">2:02</a>Mah man literally turned on family mode of the car....

Another thing that annoys me lol these guys are rich as hell and yet they are still using handheld radios, you’re telling me these dudes can’t afford Bluetooth radio headsets? Always gotta be dramatic with talking on the handhelds lol

What kind of a FcuKin illogical  nonsense is this..even if you got 5000 horses, you only have two tyres to put it down..

This is so stupid… I love it.

<a href="">2:46</a> bro they fr added the goofy ahh walk sound effect 

<a href="">1:00</a> he was not worried about being harpooned, he was surpised they actually went that far too destroy his car.

Why can’t gta make a DLC like this

<a href="">1:08</a> Harpoon shoots out

GTA

Anyone remember when these films were about street racing lol

Dom: I used to steal electronic goods but now I save the world ,what do you think of that?

Why they have to make everythin so..... ‍️

Funny moments:Roman:no I don&#39;t wanna go swimming lol 

Is this real. Could I use this technique to get away from someone after taking their stickers

As cringe as this film was, there&#39;s no denying that this burnout scene was absolutely badass<a href="">1:48</a><a href="">1:55</a>

Daym his shoulder can break open a door like that

<a href="">2:20</a>-<a href="">2:23</a>-<a href="">2:44</a>

Wait so the more horsepower the car has the harder it is to pull? Is this fast furious logic or real? 

Car stop pls stop

Which paart is this of fast and furious

2

Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38

is that the ROCK?!

Lets say he really had 5k horses. Those tires couldn’t hold up as long as it did, car would be drivable. I know its a movie but just wanted to get it off my chest lol

Lets say he really had 5k horses. Those tires couldn’t hold up as long as it did, car would be drivable. I know its a movie but just wanted to get it off my chest lol

I boost us American motor vehicles it does not make sense

When I first watched this scene, I was not surprised when The Rock pulled up in a truck when everyone else had either a muscle car or sports car

Lucky killer cars got no problems, with towing and special jobs.

So cringe
For anyone who doesn&#39;t know what  car doms driving its a plymouth GTX

Could have blocked him in lol

Try one Infinity stone, try 5…, TRY 6 
why did  no one just think to put a few rounds in doms engine bay or tires i know its a movie and that would be less entertaining but come on

The harpoons never hit him

What really upsets me is they make it so unrealistic. The realism stopped at 5 but I did enjoy 6 a little.

Fun fact: Dom’s car is powered by Compound V

naaa naaaa this scene sucks
It was never about cars , it was always about destroying cars .

me:oh nice&quot;realize something&quot;me:wait a min, THE ROCK IS HERE?!

Wait what exactly what their goal, to stay in that position until what

please say
It's fast and furious a few
Remember when this movie franchise was just about car races and money? Good times.

The tame sheet pathogenetically warn because bull causally scatter outside a vacuous switch. ordinary, unsuitable wax

I love how almost every character in this series have a plot armor

Ah yes, the F gear, Family gear. Nothing beats that.

i Belive at the Charger&#39;s 3000hp now

No one asked for more Fast &amp; Furious films! No. 7 was the real Finale to the franchise.

<a href="">1:10</a> When someone Fcks up your car.

<b>Me after seeing these guys trying to stop Dom by harpooning his car:Dafuq are you all doing,why not shoot his tires then?Modern problems require modern solutions</b>

I dont get why they didnt just shoot his car with some sort of EMP disabler

May be the director watch this video &quot;Renault 18 Diesel Publicité (1981)&quot;

I love how in the background people are just walking around their daily business, as if 5 cars harpooning another was just a daily thing...

<a href="">0:02</a> <a href="">0:03</a> <a href="">0:09</a> <a href="">0:10</a> <a href="">0:54</a> <a href="">0:56</a> <a href="">0:57</a><a href="">1:15</a><a href="">1:52</a><a href="">2:04</a><a href="">2:15</a> <a href="">2:23</a> <a href="">2:38</a><a href="">2:44</a>

Bullshit scene

Fun fact: ITS ABOUT DRIVE ITS ABOUT POWER
ALL I&#39;m Gonna Say is YOU Cant Beat Nothing From 1971..

<a href="">2:24</a> i love how dom&#39;s car has no damage after crashing into roman&#39;s car

10/10

Dom kil

Pause exactly @<a href="">1:11</a> :)

that&#39;s a 1960s car, it should be stretched out easily haha

bro why can&#39;t you just try to work together breaking out elena no one else needs to die...exept for cipher and her goon

I got over the furious movies after a few movies. &quot;How are we going to tackle the next terrorist?&quot; &quot;Sir, maybe we have them drive electric cars, they will never hear them coming&quot;

Wouldn&#39;t it have been easier if they just harpooned/shot his tires?

<a href="">2:07</a> yes officer, it&#39;s stock.

Just when you thought this movie couldn&#39;t possibly come up with something dumber than this scene.  Ludacris and Tyrese fly a car into space.

Wow this all looks a bit silly

did a door just flip over a truck that probably weights 20k pounds?

Tyler Have Good The

There are patients who like
1st wtf ( <a href="">0:59</a>2nd wtf (<a href="">1:05</a>3rd wtf (<a href="">1:09</a>

if there was a battle between these cars in beauty, this is VERY accurate. plymouth won.

Can’t wait to see the fact that Optimus Prime is Dom’s uncle

Hey

1.43 what is horsepower in dom car. Can anybody tell and explain what is horsepower

<a href="">3:25</a> the rock is here

Gotta have about 2000 hpTry 3000Try 5

Shhh, man what the hell? This is funny when all those cars harpooning and pull it, dom car should be destroyed, but all of them get wreck because of that thing? Real silly

Just loving the comments

Why r they attacking each other aren’t they family or somethin. Idk I haven’t seen the movie

Not this time Dumd !

And this is why I hate these movies now,

No no no, this my Bently 

This was a sight to behold in Theaters

How many &#39;family&#39; comments are on this video? lol

The rock so big he driving a bus

Mad Max game harpoon in a nutshell.

<a href="">2:04</a>

I havent watched this film series since the 3rd one. Street racing got a lot more competative.

Watch the drag or the line will snap.....

This is what happens if you still let a 1970s monster to survive the millennium.

fairytale (bullshit)

I like how the public dont see whats happening lmao

When I first seen this thing, I thought little nobody was brian’s brother

Watch this beautiful Chechen 
Why physics set to be ignored in every action film .Tightly pulled the car by others in 360°, okay got it that hero&#39;s car must be giving force towards the earth centre to balance them 

The international harvester mxt would drag all of those cars by it self

Efir

Keep spirit
Dom: <b>Boop</b>Door: My Time has come

I didn&#39;t realize one of The people with harpoons is The rock

This scene is such bullshit

Masterpiece

Do they still cell gtxs

Dom use his road runner

Doms car must be powered by something from a different dimension

Family

Family betrayed :((

dom&#39;s charger might be  more poweful than thanos

just the sounds of the cars make me so happy

I Love FAF and I love dom he&#39;s my favorite

I guess Dom is only one who can see John Cena

I want to buy Doms car 

STUPID…
Now let’s see Paul Allen drive
Useless scene

I mean a subway cop can just come and shoot the tires...

Is that car filled with kerosene or what

And I&#39;m sitting here, wondering how people can watch this stuffLike, they could&#39;ve called it a parody for accuracy&#39;s sake at least

Dollar tree happy birthday  party   Lol surprise , happy birthday party Yvette Dollar tree happy birthday jayila, Gonzalez Johnnie Gonzalez    
Manhattan day time no traffic????

Fans of this series are like &quot;wow new fast and furious it&#39;s gonna be so good&quot; meanwhile last good movie was FaF Tokyo drift. Every newer one is just ridiculous piece of crap with worse CGI and worse story every new movie.

Dom’s charger to dom: never gonna give you up

That&#39;s pretty cool that they have so many action stars in this now. But uhh, what is going on... lol

Shoot the tyres? Anyone? Or everybody crash into him...

Thank god for ad blocker

Damn
Bro why they got harpoons on their cars?? XD

<i>“His horsepower level’s over 9000!”</i>
Are you serious???!!! Only a fool can watch this!! that is too much
Such a stupid franchise. I thought they just robbed 18 wheelers for car parts. This got far fetched pretty quick... I&#39;ll admit it I&#39;ve seen all them but still.... 

this is literally so dumb lmao

Worst movie series ever... this should be a cartoon

Might be the single dumbest scene in the history of this dumb franchise

Dominic 1 : 0 Physics

Well, fuck fairy tales, for what audience is this filmed....
Someone forgot the physics?

Brain damaged.
This scene is so realistic on so many levels. First having harpoons installed which all perfectly attached.Second having more grip on one single car than on all other combined. Third driving long stretches on NY streets in the middle of the day with no traffic.

I can’t wait till they stop making these

As cool as this scene is, it doesn’t work like that. The higher horsepower doesn’t mean higher chance of breaking free. It just means you’ll spin a lot more when you’re anchored like that 

The only thing dumber than this scene is its outcome.
wow, I&#39;m glad I stopped watching these movies, so stupid.

So much stupid ideas in the latest movies , sorry for blaming but it got so out of mind ….

No matter how much horsepower there is, with it all going to two small wheels, it’s not dragging away all the cars strapped to it. Must be the power of family on that car.

Ah yes when the tires are spinning ur creating more traction

Like Tony Montana vs Sosas Assasins in Car Version 

<a href="">1:12</a> pause
Absolute trash

Dom is very powerful, his body is very ripped. That&#39;s why he could escape. Rock could have stopped him but he didn&#39;t shift any gears this those big arms...

indian movies suck
Holy f... shiat. This is exactly why I cant watch these movies since part 2. I died almost of cringe by this 3 minutes. wouldnt survive the whole shitbag

Such a stupid movie..

this movie franchise should have died a long, long time ago.

*hits nos *miraculously gains grip

Bro do cops not exist in this city??? This is what happens when you defund the police ‍️

What if the line Roman shot just went straight through the windshield and into Dom&#39;s chest? lol

The fact that they thought it was realistic enough for an old Charger to make a boat like Continental GT fly into a front flip lmao

Got this movie is soo stupid

This is hilariously bad

Lol! O he&#39;s uncontrollable. We gotta hold him down  lol

<a href="">0:06</a> wow

The absurdity of this video is amazing ️
This is so unrealistic on so many levels

After the 4th part, the franchise died
Interviewer: What’s the reason behind your engine’s crazy strength Dom: I have F A M I L Y

this movie make star wars seem like a documentary

I missed watching this movie in 2018 and 2019.

<a href="">2:44</a> love his custom gear setup1: 1st gear2: 2nd gear3: 3rd gearN: NeutralF: Family gear

Why doesn&#39;t my car have a cool red button

No one beats the FAMILY

Even the power of family couldn’t stop Dom Toretto.

why didn’t they even try to flat his goddamn tire?

Try 3000!!!

It wouldn&#39;t called &quot;Muscle car&quot; for a reason

In Time Thrilling Action Movie 2021 Full HD - YouTube
I like how none of them got the idea to pop Dom&#39;s tires while he was immobilized.

That’s one badass Plymouth also not a charger for your information people

Dom ‘s charger has about three thousand hp and with nosthat should be about five thousand or elven thousand so that should give boost because that’s how he escaped because even they have the upper hand against dom dom still has more power in his charger than they hav combined because if dom didn’t have nos he probably not escaped because the nos gives the car more power and boost so that’s how dom got the upper hand

One must wonder how much weight was in the back of that car. The amount of traction required....

Honestly not the most rediculois thing I can imagen the least realistic is they every cable didn’t just tear off the thing it was attached to other then that I could see this possibly working now what happened with dom in the recent one that was just wrong

Idk what the outcome was meant to be here

No matter how many horses you have. It&#39;s physics

I’ll watch when zombies come along

Logic ? Physics gone 

Anyone who builds engines knows how ridiculous the dialogue was about the engine horsepower numbers. Donut Media even makes fun of it.

In all honesty. The first three movie were great. Tokyo Drift imo is the best movie they made.

<b>Family</b> wow, just wow

Dom what happened to family

the only good scene in this clip was when jason statham got shot and fell. sold that really well imo

So what if he has 5000 horsepower? Torque is the thing that matters in this situation...

The rare Carpoon

Pure blood bullshit

Funny movie 
Cocaine and Hollywood. A horrific combination

You might think that, they can just ram into dom&#39;s car when he was surounded.But yall dont realize that dom has a family barrier around his car.

the &#39;comic relief&#39; bits in these movies is stupid

what a load of rubbish, the doors would have been ripped of

Dkldkddñls
I love how a series about cars has the most unrealistic car performance. Not only do the cars perform in ways that defy the laws of physics, they seem indestructible to the point that their performance doesn&#39;t alter with damage.

Dom s car gtx is 3000 horse power

<b>For family</b>

Low power means lower gear not higher wtf

Oh come on...it&#39;s not about power, it&#39;s about grip...

should have stopped after tokyo drift this series is such a joke that i wouldnt be surprised if thanos showed up and they defeat them with family in the next movie

still the best than the 9

&quot;No,No,No ,Not my Bentley!&quot; Like bro why tf did you bring it if you didnt want it damaged

Those door panels must be made of unobtainium

Under the hood of dom’s car is his family. Literally, he kidnapped them last night and tired them up before welding them to the insides of the car

Imagine if Paul Walker was still alive and was in this scene

They guessed it that charger is more than family . It is mission impossible to fight Jesus .

What&#39;s the model of the red car?

they act as if more power is gonna change the fact that he has no traction????

Absolutely idiotic scene
this was stupid logic, instead they try to pull the car...better they push it

I just want everyone to reflect back to the first movie and think about how we got to this point :)

Me:Could this happen?Dom: Dont matter as long as you have….family.Me:

Old american muscle was powerful than 5 car

One hit is all it takes, to rip his cardoor mate, possibilities are endless with family..~Family Lipa probably

I love the man said “nonono it’s my baby”

Corvette has abs but the Mercedes doesn&#39;t

<a href="">2:38</a> WTF

To the street races to a stupid nonsense bs!!!

Traffic be like : Nahi theek hai, tum ye kr lo pehle..

i need a fast and furious film directed by rohit shetty

5000hp lol

NCAP ratings :500/5

I wonder what they were planning on doing after &quot;stretching him out&quot; and &quot;holding&quot; him in place

Dom: I am gonna end this guys whole careerPhysics : 

How is that door holding? Must be 3000hp for that door alone

Dom's car is made of Tata steel
Dom:struggles to escapeDom:realizes he has something more powerfulDom:shifts to family gear Agents :flips all over the place

This shit
Try 10,000 buffalo horsepower!!!!!

Went from racing to saving the world 

As a lifelong car/ Motorsport enthusiast, and a physics nerd, I stuck it out with the franchise up until this scene. After that, I had to tap out. Suspension of belief doesn’t work when you’re shouting “BULLSHIT!” every 3 minutes.

But what&#39;s real is family

It would’ve been cool if the Mercedes logo became the grappling hook.

Mother very bad choice of words that&#39;s a very s*<b>**</b> thing to say how&#39;s the weather out there

what the hell is this. not even realistic lol

Beautiful cars destroyed for a lame scene, like it couldnt have been done using cgi..

OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.. How stupid do you think people are to try to pull off that scene? Yes, there is such a thing as &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; that people will let SOME things go in movies even if they seem unbelievable. But they pushed WAY to far with that scene, i mean come on...

This whole franchise became a joke

Power toyota celica
no ones mad about dom punching a door off?

family

I am more impressed by that door than its engine.

There is literally no logic in this scene

Remember when they used to tune up Japanese cars and race it? Good times.

FAKE!

Even though this is super unrealistic it’s still a pretty cool scene to watch

After seeing this part I just realized why he was able to get out, he put the gear to &quot;F&quot; meaning Family, and you know how powerful that is.

Sir i used your video a small clip for making a fact video so please you don&#39;t give me any copyright.

Everyone: this is impossibleMe: Dom freaking out at <a href="">1:35</a>  for first time in series is even more impossible

hollywood is becoming more and more like bollywood i swear

i know it&#39;s a fictional movie and all,but one them should&#39;ve really got out of their car and took a pitstop at those front tires. or maybe just jacked the back off the ground.also props to them for taking mostly lower torque low weight cars to take down a heavy american torquestallion.

<a href="">1:59</a> &quot; Get out of there&quot;Vin: I&#39;m working on itC: Stop working on it and do itSuch advice . Much help.  Wow

This picture is the best 
Biggest load of shyte ive ever scene.

I like the fact how there talking about horse power and Taj and Hobbs sound slightly panicked, mean while Shaw is calm and collected, zero care was givin in that moment.

I watch the newest Fast and Furious just to laugh at them

I&#39;m amazed how they estimate the horsepower on that car just by doing a burnout

He is groot

The movie is crap
This was filmed in downtown Cleveland :)

In a situation like this, hp is of no use, there’s still only 4 tires in contact, just means it might burn rubber a bit easier.

I here too

Dom&#39;s entire car is held together by F A M I L Y

The comment section is full of family

I like how the cars are powered by their personalities

This is some <b>perfect</b> “Just turn off your brain and enjoy the action” content.  Don’t gotta worry about the science or whatever. Just stupid fun action

He should have just opened the door would have been more believable if it snapped off that way

Best

The human spider

Physics be like I&#39;m gonna take a quick nap..

One day we gon look back at this scene and we will realize how goofy fast and furious has came to

Fun fact it&#39;s over 9000.
they pull him from all directions, car doesnt move in any single direction…: surprised pikachu face

Plot twist: The Fast from &quot;The fast and furious&quot; refer to how fast things get ridiculous, and the furious is from the loyal fans who keeps getting disappointed after every sequel come out.

Well nobody think about taking out the tires , i see ;)

This is lowkey a badass scene

Now we just need a Fast &amp; Furious X Transformers X  Jurrasic Park X Marvel&#39;s crossover.

That thing has to have at least 2,000 plot armorTry 3,000

<a href="">1:13</a> 

This is truth story happened in AstroJalo

If Brian was there they would’ve caught him.

6000 hp

I love a car door was able to knock over the rocks truck

Viva el Fast and el Furious ....  I drive an american muscle since 1982 AND I have on my C10 1979 : a 572 CI ZZ DELUXE 720R ... I live in France

Dom is a Terminator

So stupid, very stupid, the scene is ridiculous

H
We all know who can stop him. RIP 

Dom’s charger is inevitably powerful lol

Man got thousand horse power

Anyone else here had a thought that the only person who could stop dom in this scene was brian??

Casual Roman in a bentley

<a href="">2:48</a>

This scene is the equivalent to getting shot 5 times and not hitting a vital organ 

Captain man can beat Dom and shaw and hobbs

Kid danger can beat Dom hobbs and shaw

Could’ve just t boned him with that semi lmao

Worst spot for a wire ON TOP OF YOUR CAR

<a href="">2:38</a> that&#39;s impossible. How the door put that truck on its side

3,0000HP ?!?!? I just google Bugatti and VOILA they still haven’t touched the FAMILY HP

Dom just need family to win

<a href="">2:07</a> that supercharger is screaming 8000 rpms and it sounds so nice

Fun fact: that Charger is powered by a 7.0l HEMI with 800 Familypower

<b>Dom&#39;s car is powered by 5000 horsepower</b>Newton:*Ladies and gentlemen, I think my brain just exploded*

<b>Dom&#39;s car is powered by 5000 horsepower</b>Newton:*Ladies and gentlemen, I think my brain just exploded*

fiction
Someone could get out of the car and point a gun but no let’s keep talking about horsepower

I love how it’s not Dom the regular man. It’s Dom the Thanos!!! 

I do t get it is this dons intervention??

Tyeresse is screaming uhhhh nooooooo

What makes no sense about this video is that when Dom was pointing the gun at Shaw,everybody that was around the both of them showed no reaction but when he fired two bullets,now all of a sudden people were scared and started running away.

He&#39;s got about 2000 horses in that car...Try 3000Try 5Doms cars must be over 10000 lbs to move that Bentley like that.

There&#39;s nothing more important than family

Cipher is excellent as a villain in the eighth chapter of The Fast Saga! Cipher will be in these two final movies  as a villain or unless Cipher gets redeemed as antihero and will join Dom and his teammates, Hobbs and his teammates will have to deactivate and take down this mystery voice of David Eteon! David Eteon will be there in FX and it will be played by Keanu Reeves!

What a god awful movie, I&#39;m glad I stopped watching this is literal trash. Michael Bay level of absurdity.

Ridiculous

F&amp;F10 dom 5000 HP vs TANK

Fun fact: every horsepower his car has is one of his family’s in each universe

I know Dom&#39;s family now

All with the power of family

Fun scene.We all know that this can not happen

The trash film Better old Version.

he&#39;s using NOS to drive backwards xd hahahahaha this movie is soo unbelievable stupid

Yeah okay, so there&#39;s just people walking on the sidewalk chilling not even looking

Dumbest movie series ever
Family

Try 3,000Try 5Shoot try 6..or 7 maybe..even 8 lol More than enough cringe in these movies to go around when it comes to the writing 

AMG GTS my Fav
dom&#39;s charger got powered by family

surely the logic here is... box him in when he&#39;s surrounded, get out of the car then roll credits..?

Noo not the bentley 

That red Corvette

Dom&#39;s car powered by the Arc Reactor

Wait so the hooks to the door won&#39;t pull em off but all Torreto has to do is shoulder smash it and he send the whole truck flying........

Dom gets trapped<b>Dom: Using a uno reverse card</b>Dom: You don’t harpoon me. I’m your family.
I loved the 5000hp scene.. like it doesn’t matter if the Dom’s car had a million.. it’s one 5000lb RWD w/12.5 tires vs FIVE 6000-20000lb RWD and AWD cars lol. Traction!!!!

Where&#39;s the airbags??

People should stop roasting hindi movies 
Extreme

RmlN

I Swear I Can&#39;t Stand These Movies. Even From The 1st One... It Looks Like They&#39;re All Gooing 100 MPH + Then It Shows Their Guages All At 60 80 MPH. Why Stop Doms Car In A Way Like That Anymay So Lame &amp; Stupid. I Wuld Have Saved Myself The Trouble With Sugar In The Tank. So Unrealistic Too Much Drama, Way To Much Over Acting &amp; Just Pitifully Stupid!

What a stupid movie.

Fun fact: Dom&#39;s dodge charger is powered by F A M I L Y* Flashback to the fast five *He&#39;s car is also F A M I L YDragging the Vault

Filmed in Cleveland Ohio..love it

Which fast and furious is this?
Remember when they&#39;re just about racing

Whack as hell

Fun Fact: Every Vin Diesel FF performance is not him acting but instead just him living his normal everyday life

It&#39;s like harpooning  on a big shark

Is this scene copied from hitman?

How many cabs were in the whole scene 

Dom car has more power

The more i saw hollywood popcorn movie like this, the more i feel stupid.

As stupid this scene seems after watching it 10 times i still don&#39;t see the end goal here. Like what are they doing stretching his car ? why cant you just get out of ur car and go to him in person.

I thought this was a Salman Khan movie. I was not disappointed.

This proves that none of the cars can beat AMERICAN MUSCLE

I love how it looks like they are trying to capture a lion

Physics: “What the fuuu.....?!?”

<a href="">2:37</a> how tf is that door flying that far?? Let alone slamming into a 4 ton truck and pushing it back? 

My favorite scene of the whole series!!!

I&#39;ve stopped watching these now they are so unrealistic now it&#39;s not entertaining it&#39;s dumb

Family

After seing this, i really think, someone should start doing initial d movies or something.

Waiting for Slow and Tedious to come out

If paul walker came in it would of been the best blast in my Entire life dude,

This car doesn&#39;t obey the laws of physics at all!

they can try pop out the tires tho 

Physics don&#39;t exist in this movieIssac Newton: I&#39;m leaving this chat

Dom&#39;s car it&#39;s real beast gtx best car I ever seen great movie
“Gotta have about 2000 hp in that thing”“Try 3000”“Troi foive”We all know it’s OVER 9000!!!!!!!

This is possibly the most realistic thing I&#39;ve ever see in my life.

<a href="">1:10</a>Vin Diesel: Why is My FamiLy working for The Rock. 

How in hell did fast and furious turn into this ‍️

Stop

This is like the Straw Hats trying to stop Luffy.

Imagine walking down the street minding your business and this happens. ️️

Man busted off a whole door with just a shoulder thud @<a href="">2:37</a>. Lol

<a href="">1:55</a> When this shot showed up, I just walked out of the cinema. And I regretted I didn&#39;t right after the first scene... 

5,000 horsepower  on street tires with NO supercharger 

Did this give anyone cars 2 flashbacks

Watching this scene reminded me of my childhood movieCars 2 hehe lol

One of the best clips

What a piece of shYt   ;) what happpened to that series is so dramatic :/

Roman i felt bad for him
Those car should’ve exploded

Fun fact: Dom&#39;s Plymouth was a dlc car in Forza 7 and was stated to have 2000hp

lol endcar

2000 hp and his old teammates rolling in stock vehicles no wonder it’s call “fate” and not fast.

The physics in this scene is insane
This is where this movie became boring... Exerggeration and making Don appear super human....

Dom used the stolen VCR’s to build himself an Autobot.

In this scene,he was covered by his family,so......

bruh dey all doin burnouts das so
The harmonious good-bye hisologically scream because date hypothetically scratch besides a numberless state. wooden, lyrical trout

No wonder the call them muscle cars

His family soul are in him

Poor charger 
everyone says how unlogical this is but its much possible side cars simply negate themselves and bentley helping domm to go forward by pulling him only back 2 veichles actually trapping domm and its pretty much possible to do

This was actually a cool scene

The way this scene plays out is exactly how I played with my toy cars.

HANDBRAKE SEEMS DOESN&#39;T EXISTS.

He/s gotta have about 2000hp in that thing.... try 3000...... try 5000..... car guys is it even possible to have that much hp in car with that engine size...

Wheels starts catching on fire due to excessive rubber burning.

Wut….

The fate of the furious

Name on netflix

God I love Bollywood

Why couldn&#39;t they just use that one gadget the police had in the first or second movie?

When family is on your side

This clip shows how bad the movie is

Thanos: I am inevitable Dom: I have familyThanos:........

And nobody aimed for tires 

lmao this is insane man i cant even take this seriously as a car guy lmaooo jeez paul walker would be dissapointed

I love how The Rock has a beefy armored truck, but instead of t-boning dom and immobilizing his car, he just stops and shoots it with a harpoon

That charger must be made of manhole covers and powered by a alien super engine

idk why Dom was so shocked, like bro yall have done this before.

Jesus how much horse power that car have

It is so ridiculous that is is super awesome

I remember those old FF versions were logic was main matter

2021.11.02.KK.&lt;&gt;.

The fact the you saw dom and His reaction

dom: you thought this is going to be a street fightme: <b>yes i thought it was going to be like that</b>

You know it’s really funny that the scene goes from badass to the cars getting smashed and crushed like plastic toys

Dom charger was different, its not looks like dodge charger in fast and furious 1 or 7 i think 

What is the name of this movie,,,,and someone give me the link of this movie
Who misses Paul Walker?

Where is the hockey puck that kills the engine

Yeah sorry that charger that sounds like that doesn&#39;t have 5000hp and isn&#39;t pulling 6 cars ffs these movies make me sad.

I-Ready watch Fast and Furious 8

Family Meme: <b>Exists</b>Commenters: <b>Great opportunity to get attention and likes</b>

Just cause players:

2K HP3K HP4K BHP...

Imagine dom has no license

The solution to everything, more nitrous

Fun fact: Doms‘ car is available in Forza Motorsport 7 and in that game it actually has 2000hp, making it one of the most powerful cars in Forza history

That&#39;s my family

The cars would have still been pulling him back so he couldn’t have drove forwards into tej

He didn&#39;t even have to touch the door, he just looked at it wrong since it didn&#39;t have family.

Dom&#39;s car at the end of the scene: &quot;Heh... All that for a drop of blood.&quot;

try 2 thousandtry 3 thousandtry bugatti chiron

When you watch F&amp;F, throw PHYSICS in the garbage.

5 vs 1 win 1 

<a href="">1:24</a> Indian power 🇮🇳
in FF10: turns out Dom&#39;s car is a transformer and dom is the last Jedi

This is trash

2022

Dang they really be doing that to that nice charger

Hold on so you mean to telling me that doms car door was powerful enough to body a military truck

The stupidest thing in these movies 
So dom has super strength to push out that car door?

The door scene is beyond stupid for so many reasons.

RIP Fast and furious.

2000bhp monster
Fuck me with ads after a minute
Why AMG GT have clutch pedal 

hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I get how the whole message is family, but notice how much better they are when fighting against their family?

Watch them miss with the harpoon and it just impales someone random.

Air bags saves lives
<a href="">2:17</a>

What were they trying to accomplish by pulling away from all directions at the same time?

I don&#39;t know the context, but I feel like there are better ways to do what they&#39;re trying to achieve.

Dayum doms bumpers are Hella tough to keep staying on

Granny shifting not double clutching like you should. - dom

Me to Everyone in the comments..... IT&#39;S NOT A GODDAMN CHARGER... IT&#39;S A PLYMOUTH GTX.... Ohhhh for god&#39;s sake !!

Loki: I have an army.Iron man: WE got the Hulk.Dom: I have Family.

The family and the furious

This scene is so stupid and naive, total bollox 

V...I...T...R..I..N..E

gkhghkgh
Jesus died and rose 3 days later for our sins

Bro what’s up with that car 

Can somebody tell me when dom hits the nitrous why is he going on reverse lol

<a href="">2:37</a>I am Groot!!
Yy

&quot;what if one of us smashes his radiator?&quot;Someone who just watched Looney Tunes &quot;what if we set up an elaborate system of cables that harpoon his car and try to pull him in all directions to stop him?&quot;Everyone else &quot;yeah I like that one better&quot;

The saga has already done shit with this type of stupid scenes
I have been watch this Movie In 2017 My First Favourite Movie only this one But i see this before in TV But thats time I dont know Anything About Youtube thats time i dont Have any channel But i have now and I loved This Movie this Movie was the real Legends Movie Love From My Family and me ️️‍‍

Physics and Logic: <b>aight, we head out</b>

Next will be on the moon

At this point, Dom&#39;s car doesn&#39;t drink gas it breathes gas.This car runs on several generations not family.

Watch the drag while dom is dragging her car

if you left the video and came to read the comments then you are a legend 

Its a funny scene. Its sooo unreal.

This charger is powered by family

The look he gives when they keep harpooning his car haha O_O

Try 2khp    try 3khp try 5khp

Hahahah didn&#39;t know a door can push away a big suv like that

Lol even a pick up cant stand a change on a charger

I love when they said 5000 and 3000 5

Bruh they whole family they can stop dom

Meanwhile Thanos:They should have gone for head

<a href="">2:06</a>

Movie name plize
Who&#39;s here because Spy Racers did the same thing in Season 5?

COMETINAIOZ

thats really &quot;hot wheels&quot; real life lmfao

At this point these movies are just special effects challenges. The plot died years ago.

Power of Dodge

<a href="">1:12</a> who is that man name again?

Fun fact: The rock is a woke joke.

<a href="">2:03</a> edit my car

So Dom just killed his Family.

even a awd car cant stop dom&#39;s 2wd charger
When will bollywood learn to make this types of movie&#39;s!!  i think not in this era

Dangerous 
Oh we love to see gear changes in an automatic 

FAMILY

Dumb people! Just shoot the fu*king tyres!

<a href="">2:02</a> There&#39;s literally F.

<a href="">0:51</a> I died with laughter

the directors/scriptwriters sniffing a whole barrel of white powder before directing any shots be like

Wtf

This is a good movie, not like the shit that just came out on 9
All the other cars are so useless LMAO

The Meg Guy though

So no one thought to spike the road or shoot the tires or did those not work because family

I dunno; last semester in Physics class they taught us about traction....

Who needs anything when you have family

Bruh
yes now my turn to press the red button!

Did dom really just shoulder check his door and it flew off!??!

These movies are so fuc...g stupid...

He simply managed to knock over a truck by punching the door and pushing it lol Lmao
O ho kya power hai

Newton is running for life after watching this

What if romans line just went through dom

Where are the cops?

Bro I don&#39;t care how good of a driver he is that car shouldn&#39;t even be able to drive anymore.

The energetic sideboard biophysically miss because dredger parenthetically beg afore a miniature algeria. weary, possible currency

Should of boxed him in and that would of been it

People forget Dom didnt have Family power at this point as he was working for hacker lady.

Came here to make fun of the video, but there&#39;s nothing I can say that hasn&#39;t already been said.

Every I go I see Just Some Guy without a mustache everywhere...

Why nobody just shoot out his tyres?

exaggerate, exaggerate
Where do I get a set of those Family brand tires?

Tires must&#39;ve been made out of gorilla glue rubber

I just realized he used the NOS in reverse. Heck probably could do it because of family, aye?

vin diesel you sucks...
Dom always use nitro

<a href="">1:03</a> no one behind the wheel

The Gearbox :OThe Engine reving 2 minutes in the limiter :OThe door which can stand 2 cars pulling at them at full throttle :O

Fun fact: Dom’s car is powered by FAMILY

Damn this movie sucked.

My mowneee power saaanam theeeyan theeee
Fact : all guys can shoot Dom&#39;s car tyre 

why are they all straining

His horse power is over 9000!

<b>First thing you see in the comments</b><b>“i gOt fAmILY”</b>

Family Is Important Thats why He Survived

How cute, playing tug of war with cars mi~

There is no need to stretch him out like that, just bump his car from all side 

Dom look mad asl when they harpoon his ahh 

Dom&#39;s car is powered by FAMILY

garbage

LOL

They could&#39;ve just trapped him by ramming into him from all sides... like police officers do?

Nothing stronger than family

5000 hp..what r u smoking..

Family car 

And thats the power of family

Nothings stronger then doms car

Dom&#39;s charger is so powerful it started turning the other cars into Ghost Rider&#39;s new rides.

Anyone remember when these movies were about street racing?

Does anyone know that dom was driving a 1971 plymouth gtx not a charger

Plot twist: Dom is Superman&#39;s alter ego not Clark Kent

Who else loves the Silver Mercedes Benz AMG Gt r with the racing stripes driven by Tej?

:dom I don’t need harpoons….I got famliy….
That truck can literally pull a house and you’re telling me it couldn’t stop a car that’s 1/10th if it’s weight?

Rajnikant liked this scene

Why family was attacking Dom ?

Saga is slowly transforming to indian movies

The POWER OF family stone

<a href="">2:38</a> That shoulder charge powered by Family!

So how are we gonna stop dom?- road spikes- road blocks- getting 5 cars with grappling hooks surrounding and pulling him out

This scene is like 1 person v 5 people...against the odds, still beats the crap out of the other 5 lol

So the movies are no longer about racing? It’s about a group of people turning into super hero’s

After this, family doesn’t like an actual family

Oi

Familia is stronger

&quot;Try two thousand&quot;&quot;Try three thousand&quot;&quot;Try Ninjago Rocket boosters&quot;

This dissent make sense Dom turns his back on family when the whole point of the franchise is not turning your back on family

This movie best comparing to f9

Family

What were the tires on Dom&#39;s charger made of, Infinity stones?

Vin diseil has a clause in his contract where he cant appear weak or lose a fightBut this is just ridiculous lmaoo

Movie has got so stupid I quit watching it on the 5th one

Why didn’t they just crash into him or something?

Newton beaten by <b>family</b>

They chose the most impractical cars to go after him, also no way one car can outyank 5.

Is this even drag racing movie anymore

they talk about horsepowerme: traction ️️
&quot;Get out of there.&quot;Me:&quot;Oh really, I didn&#39;t think of that.&quot;

<a href="">0:11</a> when shes done with him escaping child support fees.

The incandescent saxophone tinctorially weigh because bamboo holoprosencephaly inform afore a premium sunflower. unwieldy,  fixed anthony

He has Family

why would you attach a steel harpoon cable to the roof of the bentley? why would you ever attach something like that to anything other than the actual frame of the chasis?

Nobody can defeat dom cause he does everything for FAMILY

Physics, you’re fired.
<a href="">3:26</a> they had us on the first half, not gonna lie

<a href="">2:26</a> Romanian flip
Romans car is the only time physics decided to step in.

B- but physics...

Comon this is getting ridiculous

This is the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.

But lettys Corvette is damn..and that red on it

Movies get dumber every year. Total rubbish.

I can&#39;t keep a straight face when watching this, seriously, what the hell was that??? Hahahahahaahahhaa they&#39;re all just standing there like complete idiots, it looks like a child party or some power ranger bullshit 

Newton left the chat!

I didnt know we can do those moves with cars

Today furious 9 get over baby 
How about go for... the wheels?

God bless spread the gospel

Are all their tires made of Vibranium or something

They might have harpoonsBut dom has family 

irl we would need freakin Ice tyres for any kind of grip there lol , even with 5k horsepower.

Hey! Physics called... It&#39;d like a word..

At this point he only has fam, cuz ily is missing.

5000 IQ right there

These movies are my guilty pleasure lol

I guess when ur the bad guy ur skill is increased by 75% but when dom stares at you and says family or a one liner then ur stats get lowered to negative 50%. Cuz last time I remember Shaw was unbeatable but now Shaw is just some regular lol of dude

you don&#39;t need logic when you have the family

I’ve never seen this movie, and after watching this I don’t think I ever will.

Family.

Remember: all of this is because Roman had his grapple on the top of his car.

family &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extremely powerful cars

Their cars are powerfulBut not as powerful as family

Why were they against Dom I never saw these trash movies

Haha  <a href="">2:27</a>

Paul Walker rotates in his Grave.R.i.p. Paul WalkerR.i.p. FaF

Crew: harpoons emMe: just shoot the damn tires!

With all those harpoons they couldn&#39;t shoot his engine and disable it?

Is it even possible to have 5k ponies under the hood?

This whole saga turned into trash

Surprised that the cars aren’t just Transformers at this point

<a href="">2:36</a> Did Dom just casually  elbow check the door off of his car after Dwayne Johnsons massive truck couldn&#39;t pull it off?

<a href="">2:38</a> Your telling that when Dom it the door and hit hobb it knock the damn thing? Lol this is stupid family is overpowering Dom

I find it dumb they use expensive cars for this job

Family

<a href="">2:37</a> Camila

These movies suck lmao

Ah yes 1 car can take 4 and a truck

why couldnt they just buy them car jamming thingies the cops had in 2 fast 2 furious

It&#39;s over 9000.       Vegeta

Damn, dom s barracuda has the strongest door hinges i ever saw if they can hold hobbs monster truck

Very cool scene even though it acts unrealistic

May God bless him and grant him peace
This was real dumb on Roman&#39;s part. You&#39;re trying to capture Touretto, and you choose your BENTLY for the job? He kind of deserved that for a decision that stupid.

Am I the only one watching this for that“No No ItS MA BENTLEY”

Nothing is more important than family

The red car girl is So pretty I wanna be her gf

Dom&#39;s car is made of grade A Family.

So it is basically Loony Tunes.....

Am I the only one that wonders why Tyrese had that piece of crap Bentley? Lol

How many scientists we got in this comment section?Comment section: Yes

Family

Trust me DRIVER San Francisco felt as epic as this in the 2012s

When AAA needs road side assistance they call The Family.

@<a href="">2:36</a> did my boi just shoulder off a car door

Great indian movie
I&#39;m safe its the family that matters

Does she have to be driving a classic corvette for this

You know what you can&#39;t harpoon down? Family

Dom cars is fuel with God&#39;s grace.

Doms horsepower: 5,000 DOMS HAND HORSEPIWER: 500,000

The axle getting ripped is the most realistic thing here

The fact that Letty told Tej about the line snap is so dumb like literally Tej is the smartest one of the crew

This seen somehow seems less realistic then the Nuclear reactor car from ‘Madagascar 3’

<a href="">2:34</a>Is this the hulk or FnF?

Dom sure loves B bodies in all his movies

&quot;Family Is Everything&quot;

why did they harpoon doms car?

Pretty sure that car is made out of vibranium

What&#39;s the point of having nice cars if they are gonna bust them up.

Is this Tollywood or Hollywood I&#39;m confused 

After watching this me:Koi sense hai iss baat ka

<a href="">2:27</a> half life scientist sound

Good God this is so stupid

boring movies
Nobody thought to get out if the car and grab him while he was harpooned lmao these movies blow but it made me laugh

Dom is an alien

Thats not how tire grip works....but ok. I&#39;m mature enough to understand its a movie it does look pretty cool.

That poor GTX!!!!

Is this the actors trying to stop Vin from making another Fast movie? ITS NOT GOING TO WORK!

Dom should know you cant escape from family....

Dom has 2,000 hp in that GTX, and he needs nitrous to speed away from a 400-500 hp corvette? Also, I&#39;m getting tired of seeing Dom trashing old muscle cars. It&#39;s like, let me bring my very rare Challenger R/T 426 convertible when I&#39;m going to be crashing into things and getting shot at.

Dom’s using cheat code “Family”

<a href="">0:34</a> my mom &quot;lightly&quot; hitting the breaks.

Family

Those body panels are as strong as Dom&#39;s family bond.. until he gives them a shoulder tap.

How strong are them hooks

When ure stronger than family

Yearh, I don’t know, Rick…

Avengers trying to take the infinity stone from thanos.

Im here just for the comment

Is dom turning back on family?

The people who wrote this just assume noone understands cars. Or horsepower. Or grip. Or basic physics.

The only reason Don was able to take them all on was he trusted family while they didn&#39;t.

ALL YOU NEED IS FAMILY...ughhh, Scientists are so DUMB 

His car is trying to get away from us, quick harpoon the front and pull him away from us.

This car was stronger than family

Or they could’ve y’know… shot and disabled his engine

Physics has left the Theatre.

At this point I wouldn&#39;t even be surprised anymore if they say that dom is actually an alien

I still can’t believe that this was made 3 years ago…

Epic bullshit

I dont have friends.... I have FAMILY

Elon Musk - 5,000 BHP, Whats Your car Running On ?Dom - Family

Family.

Fast and ridiculous

What a bad girl!!!!!!!!
Plot armor in these movies are insane !!!Even han is back in the next one 

Try 3Try 4Try 5 I like how they keep saying that their cars have this much HP as if it&#39;s normal And here in the real world a bugatti divo has 1600 HP

The memes this movie created are unbelievable

So like… is everyone in the background just not calling the police?

family.

Ah yes, enough power to play tug of war with 5 different vehicles which includes 2 supercars and a truck. This is ridiculous, even by my standards.

My Charger broke down after 30 thousand miles, how did he get one that can withstand a bunch of harpoons

The unkempt boundary seemingly wail because bagel mechanistically confuse for a quick athlete. dusty, available bronze

Judge: So how do you explain yourself?Dom: Got familyJudge: You are free to go

&quot;Family, nothing is important than family &quot; - Domonic Torrento

Family

<a href="">1:08</a> at that point...just pin the guy. Jeezus hollywood.So counter-productive xD

Only Dom can attack family and protect  family at the same time

Impala from Supernatural: Finally, a worthy opponent!

This is why I stopped bothering to watch these.

To be fair they were all in reverse.

You dont need horsepower when you got FAMILY

Who wins? Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet and all the Avengers or Dom powered by Family.

Why did he do this again I forgot

The dumbest scene
It&#39;s just the thumbnail looks like a real life car chase caught on cctv

Nappa: “Vegeta what does the scouter say about his power level?”Vegeta: “It’s family nappa he’s got family”

family is everything

The Rock’s vehicle is all that is needed.

Horsepower? Try FAMILYPOWER.

How ridiculous. Not even entertaining. 0/10

Jeez

Try infinity

So anyways I was on my way to work and you never guess what happeened at the intersection.. no for real, you will never guess.

Peak stupidity

So a huge car can&#39;t pull off a door but him shoving it does makes sense

Can&#39;t wait for Fast and Furious 11. Rumor has it that&#39;s when &quot;The Family&quot; will collide with the MCU and DC universes simultaneously and fight off the Stormtroopers while hijacking spaceships in another universe.

the tires had family or else they’d be reduced to atoms

He lives because of family.

Family

Dom: F A M I L Y...mysteriously 7th gear appears on the stick..

when nitrous increases your tires&#39; grip

Am I the only one wondering what they wanted to do?
These movies need to stop. I get it. You&#39;re a man. You like cars. The story to this should&#39;ve ended after Walker and that one with the sad ending. Like. Stop it. Please. You guys can find other roles stop feeding into this franchise. Please. No hate just please stahp.

@<a href="">2:35</a> I never noticed before but Dom like... elbows his car door off? LOL

Well, they could&#39;ve just sorround him with  armored cars - or even heavy police cars - so that he couldn&#39;t drive away... But that would be too easy, I guess 

If dom has family then why doesnt he ride a family car?

Diesel&#39;s 4th law of motion: When you&#39;ve got family; you don&#39;t need the other three.

So when they’re all surrounding him... why not just ram him from all sides to box him in instead of trying to “stretch him out”?
