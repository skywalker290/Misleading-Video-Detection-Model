It&#39;s a commercial people lmfao

Fake video..

2023 now guys it&#39;s fake  you think the bed of that truck will handle that amount of weight on it. If anything the bed of that truck should of been on the ground not flexing like it ain&#39;t got a plane on it 

<a href="">

I am baffled at how many people actually think that this was real!   That pick up truck would have been absolutely destroyed if that  jumbo jet came down at the speed and tonnage that it has!

Legend
okay everybody knows this was just a commercial for a Nissan frontier right?

This is fake just in case you believed it. There is another video with a white truck instead of the red one. That would literally destroy that little truck. It would basically explode on touchdown. Watch the backend, it barely compresses when the plane hits it. It would wreck that truck, blow the tires, suspension, and the driver would have most likely died as well. Just sayin&#39;. 

Dude im getting a nissan frontier fuck a ford

It&#39;s fake

Seems fake

FOLK THIS WAS A NISSAN FRONTIER COMMERCIAL.NO IT DID NOT ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

That&#39;s out of Die Hard 12  John Mcclain&#39;s son is still fighting bad guys

Lol Dude Nissan just had the best commercial ever

The video could have pulled off the &quot;lie&quot; but witnesses were super fake

Is this fake?

Fake, even if car tires could handle plane&#39;s weight, it&#39;s suspension would be crushed.

Could you imagine this actually happening

Truly a hero

You do know that this is a 2011 Nissan ad, right? <a href="">

Seem to be Nissan commercial

Get the Fluck out of here!!! 

Wow

Am can I know wich airline is it

Def not sponsored by Nissan

Nissan should award the truck driver for being their unofficial ambassador.

Came here from tiktok

Upon a second look, this is definitely fake.

this should have been a commercial for a nissan frontier

Yeah.. that truck would be crushed LOL

There aren’t many 727’s flying around these days so this can’t be real

The worse part is that i think i saw that on tv when i was a kid... and everyone kind of believed it at first... well i sure did....

A real hero he risks his life for many people

Why fake it when you really can&#39;t make it ?

For those people who thought this is real , go watch zoicstudioschannel before and after video , this whole video is an ad and it&#39;s   make from computer

Nisson should give that boy whatever truck he wants. They can’t buy that kind of advertisement.That dude not only got some brass balls but definitely got his shit together. If he’s not a Marine he should sign up.Ooora!

The truck keeps looking showroom new after a freaking 400 ton plane smashes onto it. Now that&#39;s a good joke!

Plane looks fake

Which country had made this

Wow what a brilliiant idea - cameraman travelling at the same distance and exactly at the same speed and angle with the aircraft IN THE SKY!!    FAKE FAKD FAKE. With clever computer graphics manipulation its posdible to show almost ANYTHING including landing on sun!!  

FAKE!

“Fictionalization, do not attempt”It’s actually kind of sad that hey have to say do not attempt. There’s someone out there that would try to catch that plane

Omg, it is incredible.

Is it true??? Super crazy 
Dame......

Air plane when landing is doing between 180 to 210 MPH there no way that this truck go from 0 to 200 that fast

cool to watch, but yeah..  &quot;fictionalization&quot; is pretty much a dead giveaway.

just commercial ===&gt; facebook===&gt;Thanks Nissan, I get flooded with random people asking me if I saved this plane! I am the only Jason Locey that I know of and Locey is not a common name!<a href="">

great fiction - the airplane&#39;s landing nose is far  too heavy to be carried by the truck like that...

If it&#39;s real, it will on the news channel all over the world.

Bottom right corner at the beginning of the video... &quot;Fictionalization. Do not attempt.&quot; 

i got 3 balls and this video is fake 

FAAAAKE&quot;

Nissan is in trouble with the FTC for deceptive advertising.

God Bless hero!!!! 

it&#39;s true. happened to me twice

The weight on the nose gear of an MD-80 at landing, with flaps deployed, is about 10,000 lbs.  The Nissan Frontier has a three-quarter ton payload capacity and a top speed of 110 mph.

Fake

Look at 1:05  and freeze frame. Under the weight of the airplane the rear of the truck would collapse but the front and rear of the truck are actually level.

(Not) surprisingly no markings on the plane identifying the airline.

Can someone in the plane or at the airport go to this Youtube video and verify or certify that this video is for real.

If this is for real,hail for Nissan, if not it&#39;s a big boooo for them, you&#39;re fooling the public or other plane might replicate what you did.

Now this is the truck chuck norris is looking for

So fucking fake

so much fake on this video

Why does the plane not have any logo like airfrance or swiss?

their newest commercial shows the Nissan Frontier speeding down a snow hill and then does a 360 spin off a ramp..false advertising much?

aannnnnd nissan sails skyrocket



@thefrub well , with a F-450 you could town the plane to the packing ...



It&#39;s a 727 with a 767 front end look at it



Besides the fact that there is no logo for the TV station that supposedly aired this, think abouty this: Heavy commercial aircraft on the ass end of a little truck?? Most trucks can&#39;t get up to the touchdown speed of this kind of aircraft. Also compare the people giving spectator interviews. Do they really look natural?? More like actors.

@yogeshbhat1 shuuuuuut
good advertisement  but please mention it,or some fool&#39;s gonna try it!!!



@thefrub Go Go is shuber ké
That 727 has an alfully airbussy nose.  Boys, the 727 has the pointy nose found on the 707, 720, 727, 737.  Otherwise very funny and fantastical but impossible.

An airliner this size has a weight of about 370 tons and a landing velocity between 140 and 160 mph. No need to say more.

stolen from 405 the movie

fake and gay 



bullshit....but cool...

HAAAHH GAAAAAYYY
