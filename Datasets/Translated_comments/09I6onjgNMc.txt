I miss the fast and the furious and Paulo and Dom, I miss Le is already very old, he will die one day, 50 years old, God bless his family, and Paulo, I miss him so much that I watch it over and over again, I'm a fan.
Vin diesel has ghurrrrrr voice
😢😢😢😢😢😢 super
I love Jason Statham movies
It&#39;s great to see Jason Estaham, just by seeing him you know the guarantee of success that his films will have

Anyone who goes to see the fake star tomorrow doesn't have to come see the real star because the star will buy a new phone tomorrow. And whoever loves the real star, tomorrow get ready to protect the real star because the star doesn't want those who love the fake star.
The battle of Domenica Torreto was filmed coolly ....
I humbly request to universal studio plz bring back  Chris Morgan as a writer &amp; James wan as a director for 2 last epic finale installments of  F&amp;F franchise plzzzzzzzzzzzzz don&#39;t ruin this Franchise 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Can somebody explain to me why when they start fighting, they did aim each others tool but not the body 😂

James wan the best director from the fast

Would of been better if it was filmed on top of a real car park not inside and in real life mr shaw would of won being a ex sas and best of the best solider

miss you,Paul😞😔
May Gods bless u people ❤🙏🏿🤍
Vin Diesel&#39;s performance is amazing because he has best acting in the movie

I love ❤❤❤family dom
does the car from vin diesel in the fight scene between dom and shaw really can do wheelies in real life?

love it

Behind-the-scenes images are as awesome as the chapters themselves. Both are the same.

Very interesting🤔

R.I.P. Paul Walker😭😭😭😭
excellent technology. car 🚙 seed bomb blast plane scenes are too good 💯 out 💯. one request you please show this movie 🎦 on youtube ❤️ namaste 🙏 bombay 🇮🇳
Jason 👍🤩😍
Amazing fighting

Jordana looks gorgeous!
Jordana and Paul look great!

Both are very closely related

at 2.19 minutes the vin diesel trapezoids are a little swollen, you have to stop the bullshit
Deckard shaw beat dominic toretto. Jason statham is the man of action in f-f.

The best Jason ❤️

I never thought Jason Statham would appear in Wispy, so when I found out he was going to appear, I was really scared!
It's Jason Statan and Raquel Bezerra Moreira I want to explain to the stubborn that television is imagination because everyone has work, different responsibilities, all the food on the table depends on the specific worker in the area and the artists are specific to distract humanity, ok
When I watch this series, I end up thinking that it would be cool if I went bald too.
Jason is different level actor

In real scenario what you guys think will win?

Jason🔥
I have no idea what they're talking about, but I know it's really cool!
Dom: no family no everything

The most realstic fight 😍

What makes a good behind-the-scenes celebrity so famous?
Is that Scott Adkins at <a href="">1:06</a>???

Fast &amp; Furious movies are getting suck like south indian movies and some actions are hilarious

Jason Statham the really assassin and fighter he is a man

What movie are you idiots, they're already on their 20th with the same nonsense
Jason statam real fighter

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
So real 😍
Jason is best, and vin diesel is worst
Jason Statham 🥇🥇♥️

<a href="">

Good afternoon congrats go amen good
Jason statham is my favorite

Vin Diesel handle like a man
Jason statham 😅win the transporter

I didn't understand what he said 😃
Why don't they make a film recording in Ecuador?
Omg

Dom&#39;s dodge not even a scratch But look at the Aston Martin it like catched on fire . I knew dom&#39;s challenge wheelie and crash the Aston Martin

10 years ago, we were wondering who would win if Jason and Vin fought, and it came true.
<a href="">1:05</a> was that boyka?

Why do we need CGI for this fight sequence ?

Jabardast action
So Hard

I like Dom&#39;s dialogue The things about the street fights The street always wins

What the hell is this?
Vin&#39;s voice is on another level

Kite
Producers turned main characters to criminals...shame, they should bring back street racing again!

How they fools us. ...😐All the movie is done in a room. .. and we fool. ..wonder to see. .oh wow👎

<a href="">0:04</a> <a href="">#shib</a>

<a href="">

The movie is full of testoserone.

Nice.   <a href="">#pkmusicpradipkumar</a>

Don&#39;t only hope on the Government to respond to security matters and Economic growth, As an individual you should be safeguarded and also look for different business and trade not only waiting for the betterment of stock market activities, most important always save the little you can and think of what to do with it when it becomes good for capital because we all know that Government has failed us in aspect of security, economic activities and other trading system. Start investing more and spending less now for a better tomorrow all you need is a trusted broker to assist you and manage your trading account Mrs Destiny is actually the best when it comes to cryptocurrency investment she&#39;s always available you can hit her up + 1..  7 ..  0..   2 .. 6 .. 0   ..2..  1   ..9  ..3  ..4

I am Groot...
James Wan speaks pure hollow
It’s interesting how Vin Diesel has a stunt man but Jason does not. Jason Statham doesn’t need a stunt man.

&quot;The street always wins&quot; hahahahaha no mames Who wrote the script? A 6 year old boy?
<a href="">#photoedit</a>

Hobbs and Shaw fight scene from this movie was the best..we all know that Shaw can kick Dom&#39;s ass..Dom don&#39;t know nothing how to fight,real talk..he is just an actor, not a real fighter 😃 😄

In reality the cars are crashed
Those who choose Allah have 800 likes, but those who choose Dajal just ignore them

Dom&#39;s voice is thicker than Kylie&#39;s cakes.

Love the voice of DOMIC TORRETO

Vin&#39;s deep voice sounds like he needs to clear his throat real bad

&quot;Jeff Imada, what was it like being beaten by Brandon Lee via karate chop?&quot; RIP LEE snr &amp;jnr

Jason Statham 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Amazing team of fast and furious ..love you legends

Best Behind the Scenes Fast and Furious

Vin diesel whare for invicibly
Imagine all of this were real LOL

Wanna be friends

It's different from other dramas that only have Japanese stories.

Vin diesel is overrated
Jason sthatham is best and best Martel artist in the world

Powerful film 🤙
Xhina's hijuepyt
A very big Zor.
Maahn... More than the fight,the editing is superb 😎

It's nice to see the main character and villain of a movie get along well behind the scenes.
These type of video (behind or making) loses the impact of watching films. Now whole world know that all movies makers just use Green Sheet not real places and sceneries.



Fucked up! Where did they get such keys, measuring 51 by 75 😂😂Manufacturers began to put such keys in repair kits for these cars... There aren’t even such nuts there))
if they put sub. in Spanish it would be better
cool
I am Groot!
damn, it hurts to see all these supercars get absolutely destroyed

Jason’s Death Race 1 is 10 times better than Any Fast and Furious movie !!! I hate that studio didn’t consider that franchise seriously.

I just watch this movie because of Statham He is really a man in action 1 of my Ideal Hollywood ActorAnd i love his all movies....

<a href=""> 😂👀💯💪
Vin diesel favorit action and he sound speaking

Now fandf is not the same earlier there were only fast cars but now

<a href="">1:30</a> what with face

<a href="">1:30</a> what with face

Damn see why this saga just sucks balls now it’s just to fake not like 1,2, and 3

See how they are making us fool !!!!😜😜😜

7 and 8 directors sooo baddd but 9 (Justin lin ) so nice

@jameswan 😍😍 wow my favorite director

Jason is best

What do you use to edit it?
Two johny sins in one movie😂😂

Its now Family &amp; Fighters

After FF9 Trailer?

Perfect

Jason statham vs vin diesel
Hellor

Movies create heros and legends but in reality they are simple drivers and fighters hhhh .. anyway I like both actors

Damn, its ALL fake 😂😂

<a href="">2:25</a> sound of Diesel

Shaw is nothing for dom , dom ripped Hobbs

2020?

Fast and furious is ruined

Vin diesel the best

It's all fantasy, it's a fucking deception, only Zhekichan plays the film for real
Fuck The fights. Where are The cars?? This is just furios, fast my ass. 😂😂

Stupid dumb movie

Too many bald people
Cool

Is that a real Aston Martin that they wrecked, or is it a replica?

You can fight for such money)
R.I.P Paul Walker

Furious 7 : Call Of Duty2fast 2furious : NFSMW

Jesus Christ loves you first of all in your heart, and he will give you peace and joy

We all know Jason Statham can kick dom ass

Hat
One question: why do such cars have such huge keys?
I did not eve guess that they fought not in the street

Wait until the quota runs out
Both r best
<a href="">0:29</a>

<a href="">

I&#39;m here to watch Jason

Jason is a true fighter in the real life, so Vin can just watch and learn from him.

Do they destroy these cars?
Statham the type of guy who brings vintage fights to latest movies , thanx a lot Jason , u r a legend

Song lyrics and movement of myavorite part awesome love Jason the best Mobile Phone Number October And November Good God bless you

Miss paul walker

Love FAF

I really like Jason statham

In general, they are too lazy to make films; they draw everything with computer graphics. Draw the actors too, then you don’t have to pay them.
Wine diesel 🤩🤩🤩
Furious 7 is the best movie of this franchise

God damn right it is🔥🔥

Jason Statham says I'll shut up
I nearly cried when i saw that Aston getting smashed but still my favourite franchise.

Jason Statham is best character as Deckard Shaw

Awesome ❤
How did you fuck up you fucking clowns

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 😎😎😎
How can I join u guys. I need to be in action

What kind of rock is in this video? Who knows?
F&amp;F is gonna be a best movie with or without vin....He is a usless guy and he directly stunt crew u gotta be shiting me....

GOOD FURIOUS VII BEHIND THE CENES PART VIII !!!

This is no longer fast and the furious it’s called fast and the fighters 😂😂😂 cause it’s more fighting than racing my best f&amp;f movies are form 1-5

jason and vin diesel...kindda COOL  ^_^
Vin constantly sounds like he’s talking through a fan I love it

one of the best fights in the whole series

Mr. White ? Good damn right!

R.i.p. Paul waker😭😢
Nothing to say beside Awesome!!!!

He went from picking up girl to picking up cars.

i used to watch Jackie Chan&#39;s behind the (fight)scenes. And i find this BTS overrated and only all talking :/ did i say pussy?

cgi and green or blue screen

Love fast &amp; furious

hi

anjayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Why blue screen not green?

<a href="">1:32</a> 😶
was that a real destroyed Ferrari ?

Dekard shaw is my favorite fast and furious charecter

And then there&#39;s that beautiful Aston just chilling, destroyed in the background.

sha

I want to look how the black charger wheelie

ilove vin dises
Jason Statham (deckard shaw) should have won to be honest. He was a lethal SAS assassin ffs

my like.

Did anyone notice there was more fight scenes in Furious 7 than Captain America Civil War. <a href="">#FightAndFurious</a>

They made ONE semi- decent movie....get over it.

Jason statham the best

wth is vin diesel doing at <a href="">1:43</a>? lol
Happy to

other mass
I need /behind the fight scene with Jason statham vs Scott adkins in Expendables 2

very nice

Imagine all of this were real LOL

Cool! Hello from Russia...Statemushka and Vin are the coolest.
To me. it looks more like a fight between 2 representatives of 2 different nations. Political Innuendo

did they have to learn their fighting moves in a choreography lesson and remember those parts before their fight scene; did the director or choreographer help them out right before they shot it?

Are you going to make more fast and furious I love them so much I watch them everyday 😄😄😄😄😄😄

win vinlose jason
fucking scenes no blood in faces totally garbage

Are you doing more parts of this
