Mala Hein kya. It is not good for  pregnant woman. Justice for SSR. When you are rich ,all is ok. Bollywood mafia

I don&#39;t think she&#39;s pregnant

She is pregnant, she has to deliver me because she is a woman, she cannot talk as per the law of nature and this is her own thing… and no news is available….
Congrats ranveeka
It&#39;s normal for any married women..why so much fuss for such things...they are film actors that&#39;s why???

Hey yrrrr are you pregnant or not, what difference does it make, the world is becoming a mother, what is special about it, she is also a woman, she is married, her path is yrrrrrr
Congratulations

I don&#39;t think. She has signed for movies already...

I hope she does not take things which will harm the baby.

Congregation mam beautiful Queen💞💞
Congrats RANDEEP.........take care ❤️❤️❤️
Not interested 😒

It&#39;s a good news but now she is not pregnant you just wait some more time for the good thing

If she is pregnant then how she doing back to back 5 film and action Pathan film so don’t guess everything for your full bank balance. If she is pregnant then I will happy to see deepika with baby bump so she must need take care of her baby and this is more important than money.

Nt interested..
