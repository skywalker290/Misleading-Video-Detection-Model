I recently bought a new car, but it had less registration than i originally thought, so the other day i got sent 2 letters at the same time. One saying i need to pay to complete the tranfer or I&#39;ll be fined, and another one saying i need to pay to renew the registration. The annoying part is i cant pay the registration unless the car is in my name, and i cant get the car in my name unless its registered. Who actually comes up with this stuff?

<a href="">14:52</a> it is just so they can sell your personal info and make themselves look like they are good because they use this to remove fake accounts too.

<a href="">3:45</a> Im amazed Felix an elite youtuber earning 100,000,000 subscribers. Must have fantastic income. 40k+ a year easy which would mean he would pay super tax (not 20%)

2022 I WAS WATCHING THIS GUY WITH THE SCAM BAITERS. SEEMED LIKE A PRETTY DECENT GUY TILL I WATCHED HIS VIDEOS  ,WOW,THIS GUY IS A REAL A HOLE!!!

I actually didn&#39;t know that about plastic bags...

if you want to get a constantly reusable bag then you should go for nylon and not cotton.

just because a phone has the option for cords doesnt force you to use cords, but it lets others who dont have wireless headphones actually be able to use them

LOVE YOUR VIDEOSSS

can I still win the chair?

Pewds be woke dawg wakanda

Pewdiepie is evil we see him wear shirts with Russian flag, he is a supporter of the Ukraine war, unsubscribe immediately. It feel sad to unsubscribe after so many years but some things are more important supporting kil ling of innocent people  I can´t not be part of. Boycott Pewdiepie. Slava Ukraine

this man i awesome, I have been watching him ever sense 2016 and he had showed me how to be myself. I have  been much more social and I have gathered more friends.

The fact that Hulu was already doing the thing netflix got blasted for 3 years ago is wild

The pint glass thing is dumb, it’s like the whole kilo of steel and a kilo of feathers argument. Like both are a pint glass, beer is served in pints...

&quot;props to pringles, at least you don&#39;t get scammed&quot;all the pringles cans come half full at the store though...I mean really, when was the last time you turned a pringles can upside down before opening it and it DIDN&#39;T turn weightless for a good second before all the chips crossed the gap of emptiness and slammed into the lid making it jump out of your hands...

I mean, flushable toilet wipes don&#39;t have to be nonharmful to stuff in the ocean...where I live we have this thing called a sceptic tank where it all goes, and the reason you don&#39;t wanna use normal wet wipes is because it clogs it up and causes some major issues that you gotta call people in to fix.and I don&#39;t know a lot about how they take care of waste closer to the sea, or in cities, but I&#39;m fairly sure it isn&#39;t just dumped into the ocean. otherwise there&#39;d be plenty of toilet paper in the sea.

Truck drivers have auto driver or just go on straight roads

I watch Hungarian and English videos on youtube. I want English ads in front of English videos and Hungarian ads in front of Hungarian videos. If i get a Hungarian ad in front of English videos its fucking annoying. Also i once got an ad on a language i never used

that last part of info thanks

So chip bags are 100% atoms?!

I think the truck driver meant he used Netflix while at truck stops and hotels 

seeminglessly watch

Pewds didn&#39;t realize that most people will never use the plastic bag more than once and will likely throw it in the trash..

<a href="">10:22</a> wtf, i have 10 gb for 10 pln (10Pln = 2,22$~)

I feel like taxes are just extreme math homework with super high stakes.

If therws no air in the bag the chips wont be chrispy my teacher said

dlive seems to be dead

a  new video

alright listen the fuck up ya lumpfaced twAtsthe air in the bag is meant for the chips not to start going kablamabang each time you hold it, the amount of chips thats in there (supposedly 30%) is the amount that is MEANT to be in there, bags of chips would be alot smaller if there was lets say 5% air in it.JUST EAT THE fuCKiNG pOTATo cHiPS

did someone else notice the shirt he is wearing? that it has a Russian flag on it?

How disappointed was I when I realised this sub wasnt about good looking anuses

He knows that he is Rich and he is complaining and getting mad at poor peasant people stuff

Now pewd doesn&#39;t need to pay that taxes, but pay another weird tax in Japan haha.

thats why im at YT cuz i have premium and adds are not annoying no more :D

PewDiePie&#39;s heart rate is 399 beats per minute

Pewdiepie looks finishe with that haircut

Isnt the tax covered in Shiiping &amp; Handling by the sender? That makes no sense even if you are getting gifts

The majority of &quot;gun deaths&quot; are self inflicted. Misleading statistics. We have a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem

I turned my wifi off and I don’t have a data plan but even so I turned it off. No hot spot, so I could get no ads on my game. And it still played ads. But try to play one when you wanna. Just thought about the ink one. Maybe because since it’s ink it doesn’t get bright enough to turn into that gray tint. Hence the colour ink? Maybe

A very nostalgic song, remembering the impulsive days of youth, some memories of love, a hasty farewell just like that impetuosity. Duc Phuc's cover of this song is so emotional!

FUN FACT: I just made a YouTube channel I post terraria video twice a day if you wana check it out my channel is Zane374 gaming.

nice

has anyone else realized that the yt skip ad button has become smaller &amp; harder to skip? it’s to the point where it takes a little while to skip the ads &amp; then the ad is almost over so ur thinking “might as well finish it anyways”  like along with the double ads &amp; ads at the end of a video, yt has gotten so annoying 

<a href="">5:53</a> funny part about it is despite the red being more it is actually going down while the while is more curving down very slowly

<a href="">12:48</a> Sorry Felix, adblock stays on

LOL So much for &quot;Dlive&quot; 

The Facebook thing. No, the purpose to uploading a photo of yourself is not to &quot;make sure it&#39;s the right person.&quot; Its to update the system on what you currently look like. Same thing with the whole snapchat filter things

Can I win chair?
Actualy if there was any more or less chips in the chip bag more chips would break while being shipped.

Does YouTube Premium count as adblock?

There was a time, not too long ago, when all printers were black.

at <a href="">1:35</a> the sponser ends

I am old enough to eat the whole bag myself.  I do not feel guilty. I paid for them. Now hurry up and go buy more air bag chips for me! lol All true! lol

This  video was made …before the dark times

Is it just me that noticed his Swedish accent come out a lot more during that ad at the beginning lol

Why are you not deducting part of your house, car and general expenses? They are all attached to your work.

be amazed made like 9 other videos about this lmao

While i agree that having cordless headphones is better, i would still like the option to have wired ones if i need to use them so i dont have to carry around a stupid adapter

The &quot;X&quot; that doesn&#39;t work... that&#39;s why I love my CMD+Q, works every time!

Pringels scam you...They now have 180g in the same sice as the 200g. Same with Haribo

30% is actually a lot of the bag, i mean i have 20%

<a href="">6:32</a> Perfect representation of college. Dude can figure out he&#39;s getting scammed out of 30 bucks, but can&#39;t figure out how to use the correct past tense of the word pay. Go figure that guy got scammed. Bet he owes a lot in college loans.

<a href="">5:38</a> - While that&#39;s a stupid and deceiving way of displaying data, I wonder how many muggings, robberies, and burglaries went down. Bet it was quite a bit, since you know, the gun deaths started dropping off again.

People should have called AT&amp;T and told them they’re keeping the data but they’ll actually take it for $20 less. If they can make changes without asking so should we be able to.

NOT CRYPTOOOOO, NOOOSTAHP IT PLEEeeease.....

I know about your secret life Felix

Tbh when you buy chips, you pay for the weight and not for the size of the bag.If you can&#39;t understand that, you&#39;re a moron. Also it says net 500g so it doesn&#39;t even count the bag itself.

I don&#39;t think the asshole design is the headphone jack itself, its that Apple took something off their devices just to charge you more.

A page that had copy pasted text from another site was asking me to disable adblock so they could keep bringing me that essential information.

Me: <b>gets emotionally stressed enough to break out in hives</b> Also me: <b>drinks hot chocolate, rubs hand lotion on said hives while watching PewDiePie</b>

Papper bags also creates like 200 times more polution than reusable plastic bags do. and was even presented by the Green party in sweden as a research document but yet they choose to say that plastic bags are worse for the the planet.200 IQ play right there.

I think the worst part of being an adult is realising how many people are trying to scam you

For anyone that doesn&#39;t know why you need colour even when printing black and white, any page You print will have a number of yellow dots printed on the page.Why yellow dots you ask?

Damn pussy advertisements for gambling apps that run full disco in my air pods while I try to sleep while watching felix's videos
they add less chips in the bag so when shipping them in a plane it the air wont compress the bag and break the chips.so make it not a bag, why not an air tight triangle or box thats filled to the brim with chips, instead of filling the container less food maybe make a the container more rigid

Off topic but can you make a vid talking all in Swedish pls

Really any unnecessary costs on people who generally aren’t very wealthy and a check away from poverty (most of the population) is total bull.

Why are people legit mad over the chips? Would you rather have a smaller bag of crushed chips or a bigger bag with not crushed chips?

you may hire an accountant?..

<a href="">0:10</a> what ads lol

&quot;MY BLOOD IS BOILING&quot;

But pewdiepie how did you post this video if you died No way he be god

The toilets in Japan are clean because people there keep it clean, they don&#39;t litter or spread sh*t around so the toilets stay clean for longer and maintainance costs less.

The most annoying ads when using phone apps are the ones that have the timer in one corner, then when it takes past 00, the x appears in another corner so that you instinctively go to close it as soon as you can but click the ad instead.The other ones I really hate are when the x is actually part of the ad with another button that isn&#39;t an x hiding somewhere, that is actually the x.

Printer ink is so expensive where I am it is literally cheaper to just buy a new printer with the ink...

<a href="">13:06</a> that&#39;s not a smart TV, that&#39;s an Oversmart TV

Too be fair, Felix complaining about taxes is completely different than Bill Gates or Warren Buffett complaining about taxes.Felix doesn&#39;t get all the ridiculous loopholes that these people get. It&#39;s stupidly complicated, and it&#39;s been half a year since I looked this up, but if people ask I can go find it again. The problem is that I can&#39;t remember the term.

Pewds looking like he just got home from church

I&#39;m the Grandmaster of the Blades, anger is included.

<b>Quality Air.</b>

Hm, I&#39;ll never buy an epson printer. Good job epson, hope it was worth it.

It’s because Japanese people know it’s rude to shit and piss all over the bathroom floor. 

How can I get this chair outside of the giveaway?

but... you can use cordless headphones on a phone with a headphone jack. I like both because i can use bluetooth for my headphones and aux for my sound system while i charge my phone.

You&#39;re being scammed out of printer ink;The computer uses the color cartridges to make the &quot;auto&quot; color (which appears black) instead of using the black ink, which is why it needs colors to print in black.So switch off auto and select black, or print in black and white on settings.

mcdonalds showing ads at mcdonalds is the funniest shit

if you need more water for cotton bags just make an infinite water source

you know that the air thing, while intentional, actually helps  the chips from getting all soggy

PewDiePie in the beginning: playing horror games PewDiePie now: complaining abt taxes

Disingenuous taxes make me so fkn angry.

To think that 1 out of 70 people in the world are subscribed to pewds. That’s insane ( Ik that people have 2nd accounts and sub bots but still)

Euhm no, the problem with plastic bags is the process and the aftercare. Problem with paper and cotton is watertake. But atleast they don&#39;t take a millennia to decompose.

Potato chip bags have a reason for 30 percent air it had the least amount of chips braking

I hate when they make you pay to go to the bathroom AND ITS JUST A HOLE IN THE GROUND

ITS AIR SO THE CHIPS DONT BREAK

<a href="">3:17</a> VAT is value added tax so whenever a product is transferred between owners it gets taxed.  If VAT is 2% and a farmer buys $1000 worth of wheat seed (2%), grows it and sells it to a baker (2%) who makes bread out of it, then sells the bread to a restaurant (2%) who makes sandwiches out of it to sell to hungry customers (2%).  $1000 taxed 2% each step means it was taxed roughly 8.25%.<a href="">8:49</a> EPSON released an update that required printers to have EPSON ink and generic brands do not work.  At least their ink isn&#39;t super expensive.

FedEx is the absolute worst. Taxed my package, wouldn&#39;t release it, kept it past an unmentioned &quot;deadline&quot;, etc. Also printers are the absolute worst too. Dude the printers at FedEx?? Don&#39;t get me started.

Sydney Opera House, perhaps? the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically past?...&quot;  Mrs Richards: &quot;Don&#39;t be silly!

But I expect a reduction.&quot;  Basil: &quot;Why?! Because Krakatoa&#39;s not erupting at the moment?

<a href="">15:38</a> what was that squeak lol

Hey, Pewds, do you still buy stuff for the pugs online?

All dislikes are from fedsex

Just because you have a headphone jack doesn’t mean you can’t use blue tooth, and corded headphones and earbuds can be cheaper so that they can focus on better sound

you do know that chip bags are 70% air or else all the chips would be dust right?

A year later and YouTube’s system is still broken. A copyright claim is provided before consulting with you about if you do or don’t have the rights. You need proof if you own it so this system would be better. Changing copyright claims later is irritating and time consuming

you can still use wireless earbuds if you have a headphone jack

do you think i will win the give away one year later

Pewds supporting piracy indirectly LMAO

“Now that you have wireless headphones as a standard”. Literally a few seconds after acknowledging that you’re a rich person complaining about rich people things. Where’s the self-awareness man. I’m still buying the $30 (AUD) earphones with the aux. Can’t afford that wireless shit bruh

<a href="">6:11</a> dude drank some of it then is complaining that it can fill the smaller cup to the rim

Another reason to hate fedex, they treat they&#39;re employees like shit, they give you pto (paid time off) but dont let you use it, they make people who cant lift heavy objects (disabled or handicapped people) lift 200-300 pound boxes when there is a whole section literally dedicated to the small packages that they put all the people that are buff as fuck and can easily lift the heavy shit in, the safety standards at the warehouse are atrocious.

this video reminds me of the time i went on a eurotrip. the nightmares of hotels with no bidette.

If Mumbo jumbo is copyrighting the songs (that he made) who is the person who wrote the songs?

How many people actually use ad block? i personally dont mind ads, i just skip them if its stupid

I&#39;ve never heard such a spot-on description of how taxes work in the USA. taxes on taxes on taxes on (dead irl)

The plastic bag would be good as a reusable, but companies make them so thin that they almost always rip, if hey don’t come ripped.

Bags of chips actually don&#39;t have &quot;air&quot; in them. It&#39;s a nitrogen mixture that helps keep the chips fresh and crispy longer. If it was air, they would be stale when you opened it.

20% the fuck is wrong with the government

Chips actually have so much air in the bag because they are trying to protect the chips during the shipping process. The air makes it so that a lil squeeze won&#39;t crush the chips inside as much. But that said, the two 500g bags of doritos is stealing and doritos needs to pay.

True, but in my country: 0,0001% chips and 99,9999% air

Who the fuck see a hand at other than me <a href="">2:32</a>m

:( I always liked you EPSON

gus johnson said the mcdonalds ad thing.  Just realised that after watching this vid for the billionth time.

Kill me just kill me

If they charge me for going to the toilet i will shit on the floor and say I didn’t have any money on me

Lmao I have the same tv

dad : your amarican u will be getting really big numbers soon some random sweadish dude

Pringles cost 5 times more than other chips.. So they should put more chips in the pack.

Bad designer—&gt;‍️ &lt;—pewdiepie
That&#39;s true

Wo

Teacher: whats a thing that is in common with the earthMe: lays large bagTeacher:and why is that?Me: because lays has 70 percent air and water on earth is 70 percentAnd chips are 30 percent which meansThe land on earth is 30 percentTeacher: cLeVeR

Ink cartridges cost half a dollar to make

<a href="">0:25</a> you&#39;re welcome

Felix someone 880miles from home needs to take a brake and eat and sleep hulu would be awesome to watch while  eatin in car

I made 12 minutes in, but that Doritos bullshit put me over the edge. I might throw something if I finish this video.

Hi my bro, I would love a pewdipie chair
<a href="">9:05</a> thats why &quot;removing jacks and other things&quot; is not good Felix.  It pathes a way FOR THIS

Take a shot everytime pewds says &quot;my blood is boiling&quot;

showed up in my reccomended page right after felix said that he hates giveaways

fuck college board, i took 4 tests this year and i cant wait to make my parents may even more for their bullshit

Wait, do Americans have to pay to use public bathrooms?

His all things in the link in descriptions it kind of like a tiger&#39;s skin

Then maybe stop using Epson printers? They are garbage. HP printers are way better

I got an ad on pewdiepie’s ad LOL

Bittorrent is malware

Mumbo jumbo actually got clearance I’m pretty sure from proleter to use those seconds of his song that was the worse part

I don’t think Felix understands the Hulu one, he’s not using while driving he’s using it while resting

Isn&#39;t pewds against giftaway? HMM

I’m rewatching this amazing vid that was posted on my BIRTHDAY!

Best ad ive ever seen

Poggers for God

Poggers for God

Didnt you say giveaways its buying fans? xD

If you call balancing on your taint sitting then I guess you can sit in that seat

You need a grinder to open your grinder

Now he hates giveaways

<a href="">2:40</a> This is why I rip my blu rays.

Pringles changed... They suck now. Paper thin, and taste like butthole

pewds:this is why pringles dont scam youme:sees the price :l

You could also go on pirate bay  and download movis or shows

Felix said hundreds of thousands in vat tax and he said it’s 20% of his revenue so he makes in the millions? Holy shit

This whole video can be summed up in one word: capitalism

its what it is ,but i have been supporting since the beginning and am from africa

Fun fact they actually make you print a little collour when you print black and white and that is why they want you to have all the collours filled

Plastic bag ban is good tho. Use paper ffs.

Alot of this shit is illegal where I live.

The thing about that not having headphone Jacks if you&#39;re out in public and let&#39;s just say your wireless ones that die it&#39;s nice to have a backup Wireless pair  so you can still do whatever the hell you&#39;re doing. They just remove the headphone Jacks do you have to buy another thing to order to use headphones it&#39;s so bulshit either you have to buy their earbuds or you could buy this headphone thing

What is real crazy is I pay Fee for library, laboratory and even fu**ing AC during online class .

Make a. Kid flout!?

<a href="">17:50</a> My family reuses plastic bags for stuff other than grocery shopping

bye!!

so first step

hi guys
Pewdiepie: Bottorrent is the best torrent in the WORLD. Me: It’s very useful when I pirate games

BE AWARE GUYS That AT&amp;T email wasn’t a real email that was a phishing scam to get your account info. They can look just like normal emails but there’s always something slightly off like how it said AT$T not AT&amp;T clearly shows it’s not really  AT&amp;T

2020: chair giveaway2021: giveaways are trash

2020: chair giveaway2021: giveaways are trash

The giveaway has aged well

Mr beast has more views than you

you can&#39;t delete apps included by default on your phone because the missing files would screw up things like doing a factory reset.

you were using photoshop in the video, have you studied design?

rich guy talking about how cables for earplugs suckme still trying to afford my own phone:

Wow a year guess I’m not getting a epic gamer chair

i know this video is old but thank you! finally someone said it im roughly the same age as you a little younger but jheeze i honestly cant use discord for the life of me and it makes me feel soo fucking old

„You can win chair! This chair. Not this chair.” Lmao Felix XD u 100% Scandinavian man 

The trucker was watching it while at a rest stop or a truck stop, which is like a gas station with trucks there, mist stop for the night unless they have to drive over night

Felix is in uk

Hi Felix.  Great video.  Please stay safe and healthy and take care of yourself and your family members.  To all members also.  Talk to.  

Oof there was a shooting at FedEx facility in states.News: Youtuber pewdiepie instigated violence against fedex!

I never throw my plastic bags away again

I ️ your shows
There is a science for soft pack chips based on gas injection and psi thatpreserves your chips and makes them not turn to dust from impact in shipping, but that large bag is bananas.

Jokes on you...I still have headphone jacksAdding discord friends is really easy...want a demonstration?

Said so many times where chip companies inflate, people don&#39;t know it&#39;s for packaging reasons so your chips don&#39;t come as a powder.

Honestly that&#39;s a pet peeve of mine, DVDs and blu-rays at this point should just go straight to the menu and then be able to play without having to watch ads watch warnings any of that shit, honestly I don&#39;t even like to see animation or scenes or anything when I pop a DVD in I just want to get to the menu and get to my movie and have the options for the behind-the-scenes stuff and bloopers and crap but I don&#39;t want ads I don&#39;t want all the FBI warnings all that craps unskippable and they&#39;re going to bootleg it with or without that warning

I think that&#39;s one of the reasons why I really haven&#39;t wanted to get a new TV especially a smart TV because of all that bullshit

in latvia some people just dont pay for the bullshittery, they cant do anything.

Tbh i did have my ad block disabled everytime watching pewds before got my yt premium. Cannot tolerate the constant asking   To try it for a month

hi

I wish I saw this video when the giveaway was going on

<a href="">6:40</a> its dollars

<a href="">8:25</a>What did this person expect when they saw the Disney logo?

Also, I will never turn off adblock, coz fuck all ads

People in other countries have to pay tax on packages...? Seems like we have it good in Australia, we have to pay for delivery of course but as far as I am aware, aus post delivers without taxing

Doritos are corn chips, not potato chips.
Bruh you even seen the size of Pringles? They may fill the tub to the top but they’ve shrunk the chip size fkn heaps

ou know its bad when buying a new printer is cheaper than refilling your ink.



2.1 K

But Felix, why you don’t stream on dlive anymore?

I&#39;m in percussion in the band and I have to pay thousands for drums. They then charge me for a band shirt.

Best way to deal with ink, once you run out, sell your old printer then buy another printer with the money you got from selling your old printer. Ink is more expensive then printer, but since you resell and buy at the same price you don’t lose any money.

MAD

MUMBO JUMBO

Taxation is a legal scam by your government, technically speaking.

Speaking of the App Store, anyone remember that crappy Hogwarts Mystery game? You know those ads that encourage you to interact with a &quot;mini game&quot; but instead take you to the download page? Let&#39;s just say JK.Rowling is getting desperate.

Taxes makes you angry because it&#39;s demanded by greedy bitches who do nothing to even deserve it.

Americans have to their taxes by themselves? O.o

Pewds your on the wrong VAT scheme lol get a better accountant.

The 8.8k dislike&#39;s being the government.

I once was interested in a game that was shown to me via a add And So i clicked away from the x button And it decided to keep showing me the video instead of Sending me to the app storeTHE DAMN ONE TIME I DECIDED TO DOWNLOAD SOMETHING THAT CAME FROM A ADD IT DINT ALLOW ME TO DOWNLOAD IT

Ye I remember paying 1000 dollars just to send all my test scores to each college I applied for then you still have to pay application fees for colleges so you also pay 1000 if you apply to multiple colleges ahhhhhhhhh. That was awful

ok boomer

Ah sit here we go again

me wondering how many subscribers he has then and now 2021 march 24th

I know this is going to blow your mind Felix, but you can have both wireless earplugs and still have the jacksitck hole in the phone. The one doesn’t exclude the other.

I always feel like im sitting on pee when the toilet seat is heated.

when pewds was talking about ads i thought about brave and how it is advertising a anti ad company through a ad

i want pewds to say plz subscribe in the end of the video lol

According to epson you need cyan ink to print black and white for a “deeper black” lol

Noice

Most of this video is pewds yelling at companies for their marketing strategies

Indians will relate: Till <a href="">4:25</a> I&#39;m like what V80...&amp; Then he goes to say. VAAAATLol. V A T is VAAAAAT That&#39;s How we say it.

It&#39;s lunch time here too Felix 

Pewds: roasts websites for having adsAlso pewds: starts video with an ad

Hey, just bringing it here, but here in France I have unlimited call, SMS and 5G for 15€ (17$)

If my comment is noticed by anyone, I will watch 37 videos of your choice

I am so glad to be able to watch pewds after losing my phone for a week

I fell asleep and my while watching this vid without headphones and my dad came in the room att the worst time ever. <a href="">12:37</a>

Wtf they scam us

Bro my gf has the worst asshole design

Task manager is my best friend, I slap the HECK outta &#39;end task&#39; with all them annoying asf background programs

the at&amp;t thing makes me so mad because you can get 1 tb for $10

People always complaining about air in chip bags but you wouldn’t like it if your chips all came as crumbs so get over it lol.  The air is to keep them from being crunched into chip fragments, and they’re charging you for the chips not the air 

Why do you question the VAT Felix, it is there to help you and me and everyone who lives within the country, right! ;)
I live in NYS and we have paper bags, I personally switched to reusable after we stopped using plastic. But I work at a dollar general so I have to bag paper bags and it&#39;s not that bad cause you can fit more in them but at the same time you have to watch the weight of the bag cause obviously if it gets too heavy it&#39;ll rip. And it&#39;s also a pain with freezer/fridge products because the bag is gonna get wet eventually and fall apart. I&#39;ve never heard anything from customers saying they&#39;ve had issues with the bag getting wet from product but I&#39;ve had people complain about bags tearing at the bottom or whatever else (whether it&#39;s with our bags I have no idea) but apparently the ones DG uses are not that bad, and they even have handles. There are also people that roughly handle paper bags as if they&#39;re indestructible and sometimes they rip, most of the time however they don&#39;t and I stand there thinking &quot;omg no&quot; and I feel relieved when it doesn&#39;t rip but I don&#39;t know what happens when they get out the door so who knows. Paper isn&#39;t that bad but at the same time it has its inconveniences

I heard this when I go to America, but it's Lays lol.
Let&#39;s say you don&#39;t have a wireless blutooth speaker system in your car, but you want to charge your phone and listen to music. How are you supposed to do that with the iPhone?

I don’t
The squeamish verse complimentarily gather because fowl prominently reach beyond a unsightly almanac. thoughtless, belligerent minute

I remeber once buying a pack of chips opening it and there was no chips it was just air, I dont think anyone ate the chips as there wasn&#39;t even a crumb and the bag looked untouched.

why did this suddenly get in my recommended again,

Fun fact : When you buy a snack, you buy most the air than the snack 

Fact: Theair above chips is nitrogene and prevents chips from getting expired. So the companies are not cheapskates but they just put the air to make their products last longer.I know it is not funny but it is the truth

sounds like that truck driver need NORD VPN. use code PEWDIEPIE for NORD VPN!

<a href="">6:00</a> I mean, a pint of beer is a pint of beer. That&#39;s not really asshole design.

Dlive is dying.. PewDiePie needs to save it

Start reviewing at <a href="">1:45</a>

people who like cold toilet seatsll\/

<a href="">7:55</a> pretty sure most of the x button are fake (like on wiki fandoms there are like 5 different x buttons and 5 ads but u have to literally click in a specific order or it sends u to a stupid website, and it doesn&#39;t even open a new tab it just changes ur current tab)

I become traumatized for how the fingerprint in my iphone or ex cell is impossible to configure

<a href="">15:10</a> bruh truck drivers have to sleep in their trucks, he&#39;s not watching while driving lmao, he means in the back of the cab where he has to sleep most of the time, it sucks.

<a href="">7:29</a>, to be fair, you could just as easily hop right over those things.

Pewdiepie: “Taxes are a scam!”The government, in Sam Elliott’s voice:<b>shut ‘er down</b>

<a href="">2:00</a> <b>WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS TO MUMBO!!?</b>

Would you like some chips with that Lays air?

I saw something today relating to the discount: Nikes for 2 year olds that can&#39;t even walk originally priced at $47.99, it was crossed out and said &quot;Now $49.99&quot;. What?

What happened to Dlive?

did someone already get the chair

be thankful you have toilet papers. in the Philippines, you wipe your ass with your hand. RAW HAND

I hate black people

I like wired earbuds since I don&#39;t have to charge them

<b><i>“S T I C K E R  F E A T U R E”</i></b>

Seems like a good idea to charge for a clean and well maintained bathroom till your entire location is covered in human excrement because you wanted a bit more money.

Government is the biggest and shittiest scam.  Get rid of it all.

Villager shirt :)
Ah yes bittorrent we all use it for file sharing riiiiigght

Thank you for saving me I thought i was gonna die... also im high.

LoL in Spain the taxes are the 50%

<a href="">7:05</a> thats the extreme version of ziptying someones scissors XD

BitTorent to the stars 

i appreciate that pewds wears different clothes for his sponsor sections

<a href="">14:47</a> its 2021 and now they want your fucking GOVERNMENT ID to get back onto FB, go fuk yourself FB

Wait if PewDiePie dies who is replacing him

those bathrooms which you need to pay for are so fucking annoying, went to france on a trip and was busting for a piss in a train station<b><i>costed me 0.50 euros to get in</i></b>

pewds: The government is a f*cking scam

<a href="">2:32</a> tiny hand geng

The printer thing literally happened to my mom

How are people getting ads on tv games I don&#39;t get that

pewds: please turn off ad block me: no i dont think i will

You’re shirt looks like squidwards shirt lol
The driver is watching when he is done driving for the day, not while driving. He can&#39;t go home to unlock it is the point

Omg is that why my Epson printer suddenly thinks I have no ink? Fml. Fk you Epson <b>throws printer in the trash</b>

The thing with the cotton bags tho <a href="">17:45</a> : we have three bags for at least all of my life, i&#39;m 19, my mom uses them whenever she shops. Not sustainable, huh? I mean you don&#39;t just throw them away at some point, right?

Hiiii

Toilet thing pisses me off so much, i don&#39;t mind paying for the cleaning, but many times i wasn&#39;t carrying coins with me so i had to get cash from a machine and then buy stuff around to get change while holding my piss like a champ just so i can be in for 30 secs

Life is a scam

<a href="">8:49</a> I had two Epson printers growing up. The first one worked about 3 times then constantly drew streaks in my paper and such even after cleaning and refilling it. The second one DOESN’T EVEN CONNECT TO MY COMPUTER. Even the tech help wasn’t sure what to do!Fuck Epson, I’m getting a simple HP printer next time

1 year later: PewDiePie creates a public server on discord with over 100 userw

&quot;1 dollar for 1 gb wow&quot;.... that&#39;s actually a good deal, in Canada you get like 4 gb for 30 or 40 dollars. We&#39;re all getting fucked over by our mobile carriers here

You know what the dumbest thing about taxes is? They never teach you how to do them. I&#39;m at my last year of secondary school and I have literally no idea how to do taxes or when to do them.

bruh i got an ad for cat food that said&quot;felix is so adorable!&quot; damn

Say: cu taz quicklyCongratulation you just said penis in Polish!
U r looking amazing in this clothes bro wear it again in another vid plz

What’s with UK and unfair taxes?

<a href="">10:26</a>

Chip bags have lots of air so the chips don&#39;t break.

like !

thats why i got an ink reservoir printer. it last a lot longer and it wont know if you put 3rd party ink in it because no chip.Its more expensive but you save a ton not buying $40 of ink every week.

I can relate to the thumbnail. When you buy a bag of chips it looks like there’s more than there are. Also with bigger bags,you will naturally think there is more, but they are cheapskates.

Can&#39;t wait to wirelessly power my desktop PC. Or wirelessly connect my GPU to my Motherboard.

Felix the reason you need color ink to print in black and white is because your printer actually uses a bit of color ink when you print using black ink to waste more of your money.

so if 2 seconds of my music video is silence, then do I get to fine anyone who does not talk for 2 seconds?

PEWDS betrayed DLIVE I am from FUTURE!

Hello

Ok I never followed your videos but I&#39;ve just seen you talked about installing bidets... I&#39;m gonna follow you now... (I&#39;m from Italy and I moved in UK)

Is it to late to enter the giveaway?

I totally get people hating adblock because people need to make money. I just don&#39;t like when they have ads, and then ten seconds into the article I get a pop-up that says: &quot;Thank you for visiting. Pay us $5 a month for news with ads.&quot; I can just go to another site, you know

wtf member 8 month

is pewds still doing live in DLive?

<a href="">2:32</a>There is a hand behind the chair. It’s so scary！But actually it is just a reflection.

Let&#39;s be honest reddit makes everyone mad.

Aaaaand dlive is dead
So what happened to Dlive?

The mumbo jumbo case wasnt a sample but what happened was he used a remix (the guy who made the remix let him use it btw) but the guys who made the original claimed him because they were kinda similar

I watch this video and other videos of him reacting to design related memes and rewatching them again and again.His &#39;edgy&#39; reaction to Epson, FedEx, Lily&#39;s Garden <i>et cetera</i> intrigues me, haha.

I&#39;m rewatching pewds old vids bcs i miss his face

i laughed while drinking milk so the milk came out of my nose-why are you so funny

200m subs anyone

goddamnit watching Felix rant about British tax felt good.

Is the chair still available?

bruh no kidding i just got an ad for cocomelon on this vid



Please come back

Ok vat is gst

I like cheese
Honestly, those standing seats look more comfortable that a sitting seat where I can&#39;t move my knees. I probably would rather be standing. And I&#39;m 5&#39;1.

Hi

Lays bags suck, but sunchips aren’t getting away either, you eat three chips and half the family size bag is gone

agreed

<a href="">2:24</a>, well you can just give them the money in relation to the fraction of time it was in the video ,simple.

Once you see the less than 8% thing you cant unsee it

Props to Pringles? Idk about you but in Australia the tins stayed the same size, but the chips got significantly smaller, and then a few weeks went past and the tins shrunk too..

PUDIDI

Wtf is he talking about?! Cotton bags are much better than plastic bags.

Who here hates pewds smash like

Pewds: 20% is alote to pay in taxesMe: i live in Denmark where the minimum is 40% XD

Pewds is a Swedish clone of mumbo jumbo after the ac-130.

You r the best YouTuber in advertising boring ads, 

Congrats for saying big word

So it was Sweden’s fault that the sea is filled with a lot of plastic. Very cool Sweden, good thing we have cotton and paper bags which are biodegradable I think

does anyone have this one, ok so when i am doing something like drawing i dont wanna keep skipping on adds so i leave it to play  BUT THEN I GET ONE MORE ADD, like wtf i dont give a flying fuck about shoes

What government thinks people...........*MINECRAFT VILLAGER*

in Soviet Union plastic bag washing was common practise!

How about someone sue Lays for contributing to plastic pollution...i mean they purposely make the bags bigger than they should be.

No Pewds, American Truckers have what is called &quot;sleeper cabs&quot; they have a very tiny sleeping area behind the seats. They park, sleep, catch some TV

The beer glasses, one is a 12oz and the other a 16, no mystery, people just be stupid

God damn it people. If chip bags had no &quot;air&quot; you would be buying bags of crumbs. The air keeps the chips from being crushed. It&#39;s actually nitrogen which also helps preserve freshness

Sellout

Dude, Phoenix Kill Burg, please... I get your point about the whole demonetization because of 2 seconds being BULLSHIT and I entirely, unequivocally, 100% agree with you — however, in the end, the person who used that clip to begin with without authorization has to be held accountable and is ultimately the single entity responsible for incurring this unfair treatment. They could simply have avoided using copywrited material in the first place.But again, I am NOT saying that I agree with the music industry or the movie industry at all. Their behaviour is abhorrent and abysmal of course. But again, the person acting in contraindication of the strict copyright laws is ultimately the responsible one here. And it pains me to no end to say that.

Do you even care anymore if you get 1 mil more since you have 107mill subs?

Just reminding everyone he is the guy that took a shit in a shower

<a href="">15:08</a> let’s hope that he means when they stop for the night coz most truck drivers are gone for days or weeks so they have bed behind their chair so they can park at night and sleep. BUT IF HE MEANS WHEN HE DRIVES THEN THANK YOU WHATEVER THAT STOPS HIM.

I think the lays filled up with air is for a reason,they want the chips to not stink

Parcel force and I think Royal Mail do the thing with the packages too but for customs lmao

Who tf put chips in my bag of air ?

To answer the printer question: it&#39;s because your printer still uses the coloured inks to make, and I quote, &quot;a richer black&quot;.

Not everybody want to have cordless headphones and earbuds Felix that&#39;s why

Can I still apply for giveaway, I’m about 10 months late

Hey Pewdie, from what I understand using cotton bags is also unsanitary as meats juices leak into the bag and people dont wash their bags regularly. Salmonella poisoning, E Coli., and so on.

Facts on the bag dilemma

So the moral of the story is that the government is fucked up

Felix: Your know what really pisses me off FedexMe: YES I hate FedEx Tooo ThEy RaN oVeR mY MaiL BoX we charged them for it tho :3

The flushable wipes thing is a misunderstanding by the OP.  “Flushable” wipes means they can be flushed down the toilet, where the waste material is then routed through the sewers to waste treatment for cleaning. “Flushable” means that the wipes will not clog up your pipes or the sewer (paper towels, by comparison, are not flushable and can cause blockages). “Flushable” does not mean non-toxic or bio-degradable and does not indicate that something can be disposed of in, say, a freshwater river or lake without harmful effects. Pissing, shitting and throwing toilet paper into your koi pond will certainly cause harmful effects to your fish. That’s why we have advanced SEWER SYSTEMS.

This whole video sums up perfectly why I would never live in the US (or that shit whole that is the UK). You will get scammed left and right, because the people are too stupid to notice, and the government won&#39;t do shit, because politicians are on the scammer&#39;s payroll.

How have I never watched this video?!

My Epson printer was pulling that shit as well, I knew I had to buy the black ink and the three colours to be able to actually print in black. I AM A BROKE COLLEGE STUDENT THO BACK TF OF MAN. So I went to the store and bought the inks but not the black one. I printed my paper in a really, really dark green tone ( it looks black tbh). Could I just have bought the black ink too at that point? Yes. Was I just being stubborn? Also yes.

Complaining about the air space in chips is a first world problem. &quot;The cushion actually is nitrogen gas. Chip manufacturers fill bags with this preservative gas to help keep chips fresh.&quot;

I once had a plastic package that was abnormally thick. I couldn&#39;t pry it open, and I couldn&#39;t get anything between the two halves. I ended up using a paring knife that I heated up with the stovetop. I&#39;d slowly melt a small line along one side, wipe off the melted plastic on the knife, reheat it, and repeat. It took half an hour, stank to high heaven, and ruined the knife. What was in the package, you ask? <b>A pair of scissors!</b>

I agree bro

During lockdown the printer was out of ink so it emailed my mum to buy it online and she did. Later that day my dad tried to print and it asked him to buy some too and he did and it kept emailing until the ink arrived!

Here in Denmark you report your income, what type of income it is and then you get an estimate. If you&#39;re over or under they reimburse you or send you a bill for the rest once a year.Other than that our taxes are mindblowingly high here(60% of everything if you make a lot and 35%-45% normally), the system is fine.

I like his videos before watching it.

Have you ever noticed Felix looks like the actor Owen Grady

Pewdiepie: FRICK YOU EPSONMe: <b>Looks at my printer</b>Printer: E P S O N

You know what? I saw a pattern. Before Felix got married, he grew beard. He came to have a long beard. Just before his marriage, it disappeared. Again, after his marriage, the beard re-grew, and is still growing. And, the length of the beard is an indication of his madness, which I like very much.&#39;

got a pdp commercial in this. nice

the pewdiepie add I saw in the beginning of this video made me cry &lt;3

Simp is just another word for gentle man

Felix says he doesn&#39;t know how to use discord and in his among us games with other YouTubers it shows.
