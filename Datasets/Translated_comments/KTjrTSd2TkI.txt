Bachan SHOULD BE CANCELLED HE IS A WOMAN ABUSER.

Which man hits a woman a low life skunk.

He married an ugly woman MISTAKE

He had affairs                        MISTAKE
He lets the snake Schwetah move back home to kill her brothers marriage  STUPID OLD MAN .

<a href="">12:58</a> wtf 💀
<a href="">5:48</a>

Here Jaya is sweet and calmer .

It is pretty obvious this is not a happy family.  They are so fake... Jaya as always can&#39;t hide her sourness and did anyone else see how his daughter rolled her eyes.  It is like they were forced to perform as if they are the best family. As if everything is perfect.   Simi&#39;s shows never get to the core of issues. It is so obvious they all have issues

Shweta was so sweet and shy..BUT..no more..NOW she is a BITCH who ruins lives!!!

Dysfunctional family.

Such a narcissistic family, so full of themselves. None of them is even close to each other, its so clear from the video

Abhishek is such good guy

I think shweta is kind of rude daughter and support father even if he is wrong,Abishek seems very mature gentleman.

I love this family ❤

Shweta is so funhy

Jaya really has some mental health issues and she should see a good therapist. Instead of people making joke about her please feel sympathy for her. I hope she find a good therapist at least before she dies

Shwetha is so spoilt and really difficult... Abhi is kind to his parents

Amitabh n jaya g raised their childen very gracefully. Gentle n full of manners.

I love Bachchan family even than RK

They sounded like everybody hates everybody family. Amitabh was still smelling Rekhas pussy while Abhishek was confused between Aishwarya&#39;s eyes and Rani Mikherjees hot ass. Jaya bacchan was like what the fuck I am still doing with this vey tall mother fucker who fucks me like a chicken every time he has his way.....

@<a href="">23:48</a> Jaya is probably referring to Amitabh in his last moments apologizing to her for whatever pain he had caused her

Now I know why Jaya B is a mean person to media, because her family makes fun of her, looks like it. And she takes it out in the media, though media deserves it. They are always in these peoples face

Do we not see what&#39;s happening here? Like literally

The evil eye bracelet on Abhishek&#39;s hand :)

There is so much of unspoken tension between them…what they lack is easiness and fun, but they love each other very much❤

Where is accident part?

Lovely interview, lovely family we know about the family more thanks u Simi ji love you❤❤😅

Lovely interview, lovely family we know about the family more thanks u Simi ji love you❤❤😅

I am a mom to a daughter and I wish that if I ever have a son he should be like Abhishek.... kitna achha hain yeh banda❤

Great interview

SHWETA,,,U SURELY COULD NOT MAKE IT IN FILMS WITH A FACE LIKE THAT...even your emotional maturity is wow....1?

I love family Bachchan , legendary, talented family.❤

Amitabh Bachchan.

Family Therapy 🙂🙂

Karu tell so Allahabadi he is
Simi ji please bring back this show

This looks like a family therapy 😂 😂 😂 😂

This family is fucking messed up, they all should seek seek help. 😒

I think Jaya ji feeling claustrophobic even in open discord, says a lot about her life

.

We are also grateful for amitji have a second chance.though the coincidence that jayaji mentioned is uncanny..but its not just conincidence... there wud be a definite spiritual exchange bet two souls that moment

I pity the family with a mother like this. My own was equally toxic, blamed everything on others, would not forgive the father&#39;s mistakes, but refused to see her own. She spoiled every moment she was in, irrespective of whoever she was with.

Simis questionaire is not up to mark also jaya is the most Stubborn and Rude person compared to all the Heroines in the whole Film Industry.

Such A Great Family The Bachan Family Stay Blessed ALWAYS

After watching the episode with Amitabhji And Jayaji, I was wondering why they didn&#39;t divorce. It would have saved them so much heartache. But after this episode , I understood how lovely the whole family is and how it is worth it is for our children&#39;s sake.

Happy Family shri Amitabh Bachchan sirji, I love you 🌹🌷🙏🎊💫 Jaya mam. Swetha ma'am. Abhishek sir. 💫🎊🌹🌷🙏 Beautiful. Handsome Family Bharat Country Film Industry Shan 💫🎊🌹🌷🙏
They made fun of her claustrophobia! How ignorant

<a href="">18:04</a>  Coolie accident
Abhishek isnt  a successful actor but He has done some memorable movies Like Yuva , Guru , Bluffmaster Om Jai Jagdeesh !!!! i would rate Om Jai Jagdeesh as his Best film needed a Better Hero instead of Fardeen AKshaye Khanna would have been Apt Fardeen Looked Docile  !!!

This show is G.O.A.T

Amith ji sir , Naya did not pick on any thing, what a beautiful child she has become !!

Jaya seems disappointed
👅
Looks like even the kids weren&#39;t spared of Jaya&#39;s rage. 😂She be like - take your liberty, folks. We are gonna be home in a moment.

This is my all time favorite show...as far as interviews are concerned.....now a days we starve for such heart to heart conversations on shows....interview ke naam par tamashaa jyada hota hai....aajkal in shows of coffees and couches....

Because of jayabacchan I hate amitabh. Such a rude lady I have ever seen.

The only reason abisheik didn’t do that well is because of his father. Abi is an amazing actor, if he wasn’t amitji’s son he would have been more successful!!

Which year is this?

So, officially Jaya is khadoos as seen in public

Inadia ka cheap family
Corrupt family

Amitabh JayaShwetaAbhishek

Abhishek is soo cool… Love him as a person and as an actor. I think he is a fantastic actor … lots of love Abhishek !!! All the best !!

<a href="">

You are my part, You are my voice, You are my soul, You are my example, You are my own, You are my mirror
Jaya Bachchan is so cold. Like she chills my soul 😂

Dear Simiji, <a href="">I.am</a> a great fan of yours.n I have seen some old movies where you.have acted. I used to love seeing you every time.. I had great obsession of your style and I loved you coz I found even my taste and style of dressing is the.same.When young my hair was and is like yours. Even in school ncollege everyone used to say that I look like you. Wow! ,I used to love it. Then later I started <a href="">seeing.you</a> in the Rendezvous show. I enjoyed every part of it. ,Very interesting n joyful.Good entertainment.I have seen most of the shows. But.I have never seen <a href="">u.call</a> our  next generation Legend Great Bachelor Salman Khan. Sincere request  looking forward to. Keep it.up this show for many generations to come. Be alert,.Stay safe.Wish u gd health.

May I correct… Mom &amp; Dad are not common noun .. no he or she .. my DAD or my MOM … sorry kids !!’❤️❤️🙏🙏

Atleast this family is showing some real emotions, be it negative or positive and not like other so called classy and high profile dynasties of bollywood who fake it in all interview and in front of media all the time to look cool

Mam plz do interview in hindi na kuch samajh nhi aata🙏
For years I felt Jaya Ji was a long suffering woman to be pitied. This is not a woman to be pitied. This is a wife and mother who is loved and respected, protected and revered by her family. Thank you for the reeducation.

Uff hate this blood comments thy are missing thr point am I the only one seeing a broken  family realy a very  convective and broke  family . This is screaming laud in many ways that they are not even close to be normal such weird vibe man am glad am not their family

Jaya ji ne to thankyou bhi nhi bola 😑😏 bad gesture dusto ko gesture sikhane wali ko attitude 🙏 uff

If their kids wept for the movies then they are really good actors to make their kids believe the roles they played on screen.

Bachchan&#39;s you all are great.Please stay so and keep inspiring others.May you all be blessed!!!!!

Abhishek has the beauty of his mother!

In fact Abhishek proved how good he is as an actor and in time he would rise up to be a luminary close to his father.  With one as tall as Amitabh ji looming over, it is difficult to even attempt to surpass him.

I feel like Shweta has some kind of conflicts with her mother Jaya and Jaya also has some conflicts and feeling towards Shweta.

Imagine how much that witch feels jealous of Aishwarya!

this is what happens when there is over discipline in family and ppl are scared to express themselves, so they come out on TV like someone else

So basically of this accident did not happen amitji wud have been with rekha, probably he realised how Maya&#39;s prayers and dedication revived him!

It’s so mean to laugh at Jaya’s claustrophobia. I can’t imagine how she survived without any help. 😔

Breathe into the shadows on Amazon prime is one of his best work, do watch guys, then pass your judgement on him whether he is talented actor or not.

Look Snobo Shweta then and now. Full of plastic and arrogance.

That comment about Amitji being 21yrs of age was very classy and thoughtful.

I find Jaya Ji as the most beautiful actress of that era.

Don’t know y Abhishek is so underrated the way he does comedy is really nice incomparable and it just that now he need to make body thats it.

By the way...........what is meant here by demigod ???

The Bachchans are always spending time together

It seems Amitabh Bachchan is not a strict father. He really loves his children.

I’ve watched Amitabh Bachchan as well as Jaya Bachchan And Abhisheck Bachchan movies in 🇩🇪.

Original of Kapil Sharma show ❤️🥰🥰💗
Danger to both countries
Abhishek is the real handsome in newcomers n good dancer, he is unnecessarily critisized taking his career, lambi race ka ghoda hai wo

It looks like an family counseling rather than interview. Just remembering the good old days of their lives.

Guddi gay or guri suprhit amitabji sirf jayajise pyaar kiya
Amitabji mahan jayaji mahan actor jayaji don't think twice.
Simiji beautiful actresses Sundar ahat apn criar banva Tai
These all shows looks very very nice illusive and like fairy tales I like all these showsBut I suppose I would have adoredIf she would have interviewed the poorest of the poorest and the most neglected deprived people in our society

What an incredible interview

Eyes don’t lie. 👀 Mother &amp; daughter issues clearly. He might be humble but his sons clearly not. Interesting interview..

anybody noticed the amount of rings Amitabhji is wearing.  2 huge blue Sapphires, Emerald on his pinky and Opal on his Index finger. Abhishek too is wearing a lot of charms - one is the evil eye bracelet.  Many will call it superstition but honestly its not. Sometimes its these charms that allow us to hang on to life , to hope that tomorrow will be better.  I have &quot;experienced&quot; miracles just the way Amitabhji after being declared dead was back to life with a co-incident that another man breathed his last the exact moment he was back to life. Such things do happen. There could be no scientific explanation to such incidents but i have read, heard watched videos and even experienced such miracles.  had watched a video on Oprah Winfrey show. a couple lost all their 3 kids in a horrific accident and after a few years went on to have triplets !!  watch it here<a href="">

one  of the best interivew

viewers they are legend who are still watching in 2021

I DONT KNOW WHY I FIND SWETA BACHHAN AS THE YOUNGER SMRITI IRANI.IT&#39;S VERY SIMILAR.I LIKE THE BACHCHAN&#39;S A LOT

this family needs to. animate more

Looks like Abhishek has issues. This is a problem when one parent is such a super star. The girl also seems like she has issues. Jaya Bahaduri also looks like she has issues. The whole family feels a bit off and dysfunctional imo. There was a distinct element of cringe when they were all together all throughout. Feels like they&#39;re not used to people or making jokes and discussing things like normal people do. Clearly a product of their success (of Amitabh really who himself seemed the best and most classy and normal) and upbringing which was different.

Fear to closed area is ----CLAUSTROPHOBIA, Similarly ,Fear to open area is called AGORAPHOBIA.

Lovely

As family  they are hilarious....🤣🤣🤣🤣love it
Love ❤
This is so awkward interview lol

Pls bring this show back

A daughter is NOT a lady of the house. She is a daughter, period. You should show your wife some respect!

Beautiful family ❤️❤️
Shweta is so rude towards Jaya. She is making fun of her mother. May be that&#39;s why Amitabh loves her more.Abhisekh is rude towards Shweta. Abhishek said Jaya is the punching bag of the family. O m g🙄They are so rude to Jaya. All together they are attacking Jaya. They even made fun of claustrophobia.

They shouldn’t have laughed at Jaya Ji when she was explaining how she feels

They are just like us, their problems are just like us. They hold whatever status but they are just humans so don&#39;t worship them, just appreciate and that&#39;s it.

Simi Ji, you have to bring back this show. We actually do get to know the real people instead of the image created by the PR’s. You are terrific at what you do.

Nothing about Rekha?🙄

Arrogant Amitabh Selfish

Abhishek Bachchan loves his mumma.

Abhishek Bachchan is a highly underrated actor.

Abhishek is so gentle and down to earth even more in everything than Amitabh .

Nice😂😂 n lovely
Great Episode

In real life , Jayaji must be the one wid the dialogue.........PARAMPARA,PRATISHTHA ANUSHAN....Jst kiddin, but i feel they have a lovely bonding...

When I was a kid my Mother once told me about the Coolie accident while watching the movie... Like how all of the country was Praying for his recovery. But, I never knew how serious it was. Well Thanks... for uploading this interview, I didn&#39;t know about Simi Ma&#39;am but now I know how great and Classy she is. Also,  it reminded me of my Mother, who is no more.

Congrats Mrs and Mr Bachcham nice family and all of them are  perfect with their english.

He is only Entertainment object

i find solace and comfort with simi&#39;s interviews. Learnt a lot of how to approach and appreciate people. I find no words to appreciate you. Love you much more!!!!!!!!!!

Simi Ji, It Was 4 Wonderful Months. Your Rendezvous Was A God Send for me. Today, is my Last Day Of  Watching this Amazing Show Called (Rendezvous with Simi Garewal).

Garewal for Being A Wonderful Teacher. I have Tears in my Eyes As I am Typing These Comments at This Very Moment. Thank You 🙏 Thank You 🙏 Thank you 🙏 Thank you 🙏. New York

Great Interview...Asking all the members of any Indian family to express themselves in front of each other in national TV is difficult. Simi handled the interview singlehandedly. The silence shows respect that the family members have for each other. It is through this interview that I can actually felt what Amitabh suffered during and after July. 1982. Till date, I had heard in numerous news channels and TV shows about the clinically dead episode but get the feeling only through this interview.

I find jaya and Abhishek to be most natural.

Nice to watch.

Hi leopard😂

’I hope I didn&#39;t say anything wrong.’’Of course not!’

I LOVE YOU ...  I LOVE YOU

Kadu oil is hilarious
Jaya bhaduri was a bigger and better actress than amitabh bachhan..But things changed when she jaya bacchhan...sad thing is her kids dont understand the sacrifice.

I dont shweta bacchan understand her mothers pain at all...or what kind of a husband her father was..

Nice 🙏💯💯🗡️🙏
Lockdown viewing special 😉Why do I get a feeling they are not being genuine ... as if they face their best faces on. Desire to look good in others eyes. Didn’t get any sense of their persona except for maybe Amitabh

Very very very nice interview
Fake family

Wow there’s a lot of mother daughter tension brewing during this time. Sweta being the first born probably got the brunt of her mum’s rage as a first time mum. Plus Amitab was so busy out working, it could have been post partum blues for Jaya. Mums always pick on their gals a lot and vent their frustrations a lot more on them ( I’ve gone through the same experience). Now i think Jaya is going through menopause that’s why she’s got pent up anger in her a lot. I can’t imagine Aiswarya living with all of them. Thank goodness they moved out.

I kinda feel sad for jayaji. No one is actually understanding her and just making fun of her.

wait theyre so sweet. i dont get the family problem comments

Rekha is doing better alone than all of them

Indian masses have revolted. We will boycott you to no end. Down with Dhoni!!! Down with cricket team! Not a single request for CBI inquiry for SSR. Down with Zoya &amp; Farhan Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, Shabans Azmi for supporting the influential criminals guilty of murdering a national treasure, an icon, a legend, Sushant Singh Rajput. You chose to side with the oppressor and the murderers. We will remember where you stand on this. It is NOT a witch hunt or a media trial as you would like to portray on your fictional narrative. It’s but the opposite. If this was Farhan hanging from the ceiling fan, would you claim the same position?!Hypocrisy! All Bollywood celebrities have shown their true colors...Bachan family, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor; not one word requesting inquiry into a murdered legend, SSR. Complete boycott of Bollywood, do not click on any of their videos, do not view, do not comment, do not like or dislike. We, the Indian masses will not be silenced or distracted or fooled by Rhea, Pithani, Pancholi, Khan, Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena, Baby Penguin, Mumbai Police. Indians, all over the world have their eyes on Republic TV, Ujjwal Trivedi, Ishkaran Bhandari, the Supreme Court of India and CBI. Maharashtra Govt and Mumbai police are involved and protecting the true criminals. They have reasons to cover up the murder of a legend. All their actions and mishandling of the case are evidence enough of their guilt. Shameful that major Indian media channels are still not giving SSR the fair share of coverage. They’re scared...just like the Bollywood celebrities. If SSR fails to get justice, the common man of India will have no shot at justice everr again. <a href="">#Justice4SSR</a> <a href="">#CBIForSSR</a> <a href="">#GlobalPrayers4SSR</a> <a href="">#BoycottBollywood</a> <a href="">#SCMonitoredCBIForSSR</a>

Shall surely be pleased if the show was run by our other women whom we RESPECT RESPECT

Can someone please put the subtitles in Portuguese? Thanks
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Jaya Bacchan Amma, A Huge massive sweet Hug to you! May God give back to you the tender yourself who was so much at peace when you were younger and not always a giver. I know you have given so much to each one in the family but haven&#39;t received back the amount of love you truly deserve. May some nice things happen and you start being super peaceful and happy+loved. P.S: I loved you in the movie: Guddi.

I have never seen anything quite like this. I am not sure what to make of this. This interview feels real, cringe worthy, and like a tinderbox that can explode at anytime. And it also feels so jarring with how the conversation flows between the participants. I can’t quite describe it but there is something so different about this interview

Such an emotional, real, beautiful family

Add Aishwarya too and the level of awkwardness and tension in the air will rise by 50%😌

The relationship  btw abhishek n shweta is the best in the famly

Very funny.humorous family😀

This was fun😂😂😂

The old interview Jaya bacchan hairs are white and now black..I Know both are old but the too

They r real.they don&#39;t show off

As dysfunctional as they may seem it makes them seem all the more real. Family have alliances. Despite trying not everyone is equal. Them being upfront about it really makes me respect them

Abhishek is such a good son to his mother, he supports her at every turn

They seem to be a normal family but since they are also in the public eye, they are super conscious about what to say and reveal. Even about regular and common stuff like a parent being partial to one child and children&#39;s fighting. That comes across as tension between them but I don&#39;t think they are like that when they are on their own, without the public.

Jays ji went teary when speaking about the accident she loves and cares for amithji so much this is why I like jayaji more than rekha Jayaji is perfect for this family rekha could not have done as much a jayaji did jayaji is perfect for amitji and the whole family.

I don&#39;t know why but I feel Amitabh Bachchan looks better now with all white hair rather than the earlier Brown Hair and White Beard. And the same goes for Abhishek, he also looks better than that time.

Is it a family councling😂😂😂😂 I pray for Aishwarya🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
What! The family is defined by &quot;huge fights&quot;.

Quintessential bourgeois show; except for Simi&#39;s communication skills and demeanor and gentle probing, perhaps there&#39;s nothing to like about the show, especially the celebs. It hurts to realize that you have to be really a big shot to get interviewed by her. That said, I have nothing against Simi. I love the interviewer most of all, and none of the celebrities she grills.

Very serious family 🤨😏
When I saw this whole interview I could relate her to princess lady Diana same grace dignity

Haters don&#39;t over use ur mind , Love n understanding within family don&#39;t need to be showcased in any interview lyk this.Both Abhi n Shweta are decent yet so humorous, this is the way they r brought up much better than those kids who don&#39;t knw to respect n luv their parents or any other aged person publicly. Who r speculating this family to b cold are actually the one who believes in show off n can&#39;t digest any family taking stand up for each other as a strong pillar lyk this.This family is an ideal example of strong, disciplined,humorous n lovely family.

I always felt this tension between Amitabh and Jaya which I haven’t seen with other couples interviewed on the same show like Sharmila Tagore and Nawab Pataudi etc. Jaya seems like she is scared of Amitabh.

To translate in French
I feel  Jayaji and Shweta could have worn better outfits.....this interview was taken in the new millennium I suppose..... dressing sense of the entire world changed a lot then...then why these ladies were dressed up as if they were in early 90&#39;s or even before that.....

Its not funny if jaya is Claustrophobic

<a href="">12:25</a> - <a href="">12:35</a> &quot;Pooja, What is this behavior?&quot;

I just hate that y guys in Bollywood wear blazer  nd tie,,instead they can wear  good looks like other than this...black blazer ties

i dont understand why people are calling them &quot;depressing&quot; family, i think they are of of the most &quot;strong family&quot;  that belong to bollywood. they are argumentative, moody and expectations of some sort from each other but thats common in majority of families.

Pretentious
Look at the oratory skill of Simi. Falmboyant. Though never had the fortune to watch the series then, but I enjoy every part of it today

Abhishek and his sister had the same sibling relationship ME and my BROTHER Always have-FIGHTING

This reminds me of my family 😂

Enaku amala akkikeni ok.. big fame neengum ok... rendu perume big fame. Decent actor.
When Any Man as in His Young age He Has Some Mistakes But a Mother Has Never any Mistake. Mothers are Great

Simi garewal ji Another day please talk in hindi. Because we r Indian  ?

Shweta is copy of amitabh bachan and abhishek is of jaya ji

Anybody who comes in close contact with Amitji changes Jaya n Aishwariya 😂

My mother underwent emergency laparotomy recently...the pain that we went through is inmeasurable

Mashalha beside the fame they such a happy family well that&#39;s how it was all the time watching the bachans but now they all look so moody I hope I am wrong because the bachans have entertained me n my family for so many years may Allha bless the bachans and bring many happiness in there home ameen.

This interveiw gives a summary of the domestic rivalries of the Bachan house.

Jaya bachan hints that Shweta bachan is not polite towards her mother.

Years later in 2020 Aaradhya bachan is the light of Bachan family.

See the shrimi face ..

Everyone talkinh ill about the interview please watch all three parts

AB should believe in True living God of Abraham in Jesus Christ name,So True living God can continue his generation.

All nice
I really hate they act in hindi movies and they give interviews just english, there are huge percentage of fans who love there actors speaking hindi language. it just brings great feeling if you atleast speak little bit hindi too.

Everyone in the family is acting weird for each and everyone that is actually weird

Amitabh is a like phoenix that rose from the ashes! Very inspirational! Jaya seems so domineering and difficult to please. Shweta and Abhishek are cool and funny. Shweta is the only one who doesn&#39;t try to pretend they are a perfect family. She doesn&#39;t care about maintaining an image and is honest about her feelings on their family dynamics.

Mam love you so much since Karz movie..mam love your work and the best specially for everything and I need your son&#39;s birthday how lucky and blessed day and time for everything

Simi you are my fevrit I like you

Jaya is a strong woman. They should take care about her more. I can&#39;t believe Amitabh and Rekha betrayed her as a husband and friend. Poor jaya 😔💔

Amitabhji : A Gem of  of  India.

Amitabhs  both children look like him,theirs must be a peace loving family ,they all love each other and very emotional. Simi as an Anchor giving life to the interaction.9642844309.Hyderabad Revelli Ashok Kumar

Amit is a type actor ,he got hit only in atypical young angry man role.when he was over exposed his  films got flopped

Har waqt over acting is speciality of amit

Amit, no matter how many scholars he has become, he is not there.
Amit, can I have a normal conversation with you sometime?
Aish’s stupid decision coming in this artificial family..

jaya expression at 03 :42 .poor lady..
Simi garewal way of talking is  too sweet

So sweet Bachchan ji
Shweta could have done lots of cosmetic surgery and become a totally different looking woman , But she even haven’t Straighten her hair, By this we can see, She is so much down to earth 🥰

Amitabh is an asshole

Mom love sweet mom
Still Nice to watch it bless

Kids love Dady mama too , i can see that. Bless bless

She needs help, she is in pain. I think Abhishek is the only person who understands her

The way Amit sir looks at his daughter😍😍😍only a dad can do that btw love and respect the family 🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤

By blessings from. See Shiva prasad. Om sai Shiva

Om sai Shiva. See Shiva prasad. K

The family is gracious... But d guy is a hypothetical

Abhishek several times in this interview had this bizarre rude way of seemingly competing with his sister about how much their dad meant to him. Example at <a href="">5:11</a>. But little surprise when parents play favoritism so blatantly, and it&#39;s soooo unhealthy for the kids psychologically and causes division and resentment. It&#39;s so damn cringe worthy! 😝

It&#39;s like Amitji, Abhishek and Shwetha just ganged up against Jayaji. Poor her, felt sorry for her. But, but Abhishek making fun of her saying she has persisting neck problem because she has to look up to all three was so so funny and cruel at the same time. I laughed my lungs out but then felt guilty about it for doing so.

Very nice interview. Real, subtle, emotional and graceful. Unfortunately, most people commenting here are used to frivolous laughs and loud mannerisms. Miss these decent interviews without chillam chilli and imposed laughs  that&#39;s common today. Maneka Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Rekha, Vinod Khanna ... etc. - all wonderful interviews. Alas we are left to tolerate Karan Johars and worse today! Thanks for putting these on YT.

Abhishek is most matching personality with great amit ji god bless your family

Mrbachan so cool the rest kinda tence

Shwetha bacchans reaction at <a href="">2:26</a> secs..says a lot about the relation kids share with parents

These people cannot speak in Hindi.
Very beautiful family

The situation was tense and depressing

Simi ji,  I guess, there must be a list of celebrities with whom you have planned for  &quot;Rendezvous&quot; but due to reasons, didn&#39;t work out.

Jaya Bachchan feels betrayed and sidelined as a wife. She wants to control her husband&#39;s acting career and alliances thereof, while being in a glamour business. She feels threatened by good looking and very attractive females working with Amitabh Bachchan.  Amitabh Bachchan wants someone more loving, better looking, chirpier and less combative lady in his life. Why latch onto that relationship which is claustrophobic? Separation can be cordial too. At least both can be truly happy. Why live to put up a facade of happiness when everything is so brutally conspicuous?

Amitabh bachan daughter she&#39;s not hansome girl at all to compare with other rich daughters family

It wasn&#39;t nice of Shweta and Abi to laugh at her as she desperately tried to explain her claustrophobia/anxiety. Mental health is no joke.

This family is the perfect example of the old generation typical indian family where mental problems are nothing. I feel for Jaya ji, she deserves much more than this. Shweta herself accepts the fact that Jaya ji literally spent  majority of her life in the home. Much love and power to her💜

So much depressed family no collaboration  happiness and closeness like the Saif Ali khan family... No happiness insideOnly maintaining a public image and professional

Happy family

A wonderful family v,ery honest interview

I am crying....what a wonderful and somehow depressing interview!

Abhishek and his sister has the same relationship as me and my freaky brother.We fight ALL THE TIME!

Grate Interview..

Please check your haemoglobin and thyroid levels Dear Jayaji

Dishonored Rekha.
She is depressed..in a loveless married life ,gave up her career ,I can relate to her.. 100%

Omg I can seee mother and son against father and daughter I really enjoy this video  topical family

Omg Abishake you was badddddd

Sir your son is soooo hand some your daughter is just like her pa pa love you guys much respect to you and your family hailing from New York

Jay is very loving person but after marriage to amitabh her life got ruined she is more beautiful than rekha more talented than rekha. Rekha is a isolated women only knows to snatch other women&#39;s man and rekha secretary is a Lisbon. Sweta has got a manly face and covering her father betrayal towards her mother shame on her.

<a href="">10:16</a> Shweta was like WTF! he is a brat

Abhi is a very good actor. Just not the very good luck.

Very dignified family in bollywood

<a href="">11:18</a>  plastic surgery se pehle aisi thi 🙄

Omg So much COLDNESS in this family. I feel Everyone is in love with each other, but at the same time everyone are distant. I figure what they lack is WARMTH and happiness AND FUN.

I totally enjoyed it

Yr ye kitne aram se bol rhe h....🤒so humble... In our haryana v call like Bomb is going to blast....that much loud😜

It seems as if you have come to someone's dead body.. Strange log.
I lk Abhisek

My Hero no.1
Shewta is so cuddly girl..where do u find such girls.

Such shows are lost now.And I think it&#39;s not a good thing to happen.

A big selfish creature: Amitabh Bachchan
jayas hair style is very neat with clear face, not as now a days heroins

Abhishek wears eye protection glasses😀😀😀
Beautiful family god bless them.

Wow Simi you are amazing to get the Bachan family together. Mr.Amitabh is a humble man of great strength &amp; character. He  tells us how he lost in his business &amp; never let that stop him.

Jaya baccha such a drama queen and shweta with stupid smile🤣

why they are lacking family thing

beautiful bchan family

Simi Garowal is one of the best actress👌👌👌

I really dont know what to make of this interview. As usual simiji was elegant and warm , but it just seemed there was some tension in the air among the bachan family . They all looked at each other , esp the kids at their parents , as if asking permission before they spoke , not in a respectful kind if way but more like they were worried about it . Something just didnt add up . Though one thing was pretty clear , shweta has a lot of resentment against her mom about how abhishek was treated bettr . Sad thing is , jaya didnt once say that both were equal for her , which most moms would say . Instead jaya acted as if it was no big deal . I felt bad for shweta

Good

Jayaji has tearful eyes while narrating coolie accident..true love

Father love doughter n mother more close to the son

Nice to see Amithab bachan Sirsa family interview 🙏👌

I feel bad for Shweta Bachchan

Jaya do miserably dredded

What is the secret in their hairs??

both children are on father's side
Abhishek is truly lucky to have a father like Amitabh. Great family indeed.

Guys these stories tells us nothing is in perfect shape and the beauty is accepting our very own nature :) if something is bound to happen either its good or bad how gracefully we take everything :)  karma :) both are still together and pray for him and all सब का मंगल हो :)  🌸💜 beauty stand  where some balanced mind exist

Looks like an axis between sr ab and shweta and jaya b and jr b, think he&#39;s the only one who feels for his mother

I see a wonderful  family.  I see lots of jealous people commenting

Collie was a movie during wch amitabh was deeply in love with rekha ....It was this accident when rekha nd amitabh got seperated

Every one who call jaya bachchan arrogant and rude should watch her GUDDI movie she was always laughing naive and cute ...and her old interview Now she is all changedIn their family only jaya bhadhuri and abhishek looks good

U can watch Govinda Sunita interview after this to laugh a little

I also love this man

Well mannered and behaved kids they have. So calm and polite.  Being celeb and bringing up kids to good humans are might not be the easy task. Amitabh and Jaya did it very well.

She treats her daughter like she&#39;s a bastard child of amitabh and rekha lol.

Can cut the tension with a sword! So awkward

Jaya ji u look so beautiful😍💓
Please always  trzandslate im english that we can understsnd ,thank you.i am from abroad  thank you again bless you all .

So much tension in the family

lovely

such a well brought up family 👍👍love story between schweta and abhishek

Shweta may be daddy&#39;s princess but she is very rude to her mom, she may do that in private but on a public podium, she can atleast show a lil bit respect...

Oh my, beneath the skin they are so much like any average family with all the teasing and laughter.

amitabh  seems like a very bad person

Shweta takes after her father and is normal. Abishek takes after his mother and is average, He is no good, lazy and selfish.He is spoilt by his mom. He is the dead weight of the family. Jaya Bhaduri is the lottery winner by getting married to big B.

Mam why your website isnt working??  Its showing connection timed out. Please check it out!

Omg... Jaya bachan is suffocating in that family..somebody at least give her a hug

I find Simi to be soo creepy

Amitabh damned good actor  andhon mein kana raja. cowardly confused  answers ! Trying to be politically correct. And Jaya better actor than Amitabh but she&#39;s mentally not well. It&#39;s written all over her face. And it&#39;s her feeble voice all indicating she&#39;s suffering from MDP

It&#39;s funny how people think they know other people&#39;s lives. They always harp about Amitabh and Rekha or Srk and Kajol. There is a difference between reel life and real life.

What a depressive family

Who is most moody al of uss.....hahahaba

Abhishek Bachchan has everything.  He is just not serious about his acting.  He has ruined it

See this program and compare with Coffee with Karan.

Such a beautiful family this is. Amitabh and Jaya have had a truly successful marriage. May God bless them .

Joya is a good partner for amitabh ....she is good housewife. Patience woman ....who know the relationship of amitabh and rekha.....but strongly handle this, I think rekha is a dynee....respect fr joya, and abishek and her sister is lucky to get a mother such jaya.....

What a depressing family !  It seems there no mental connection among them .

NICE!  THE BEST!

Swetha is appearing  like an eternal ocean

i am still trying to gulp that big b said &quot;kadu tel&quot;&#39;

Abhishek . You are the best

They look so uneasy in the presence of each other....

<a href="">9:13</a> Rewind

Any one 2019???

i love two kids of bachan! both r so humble ,adorable and  beautiful vibe

jaya needs med attention ,very aggressive nasty woman

LOVE this man as an actor. He has certainly revolutionized his craft and to still be box office hit to this day...is a lesson the younger actors and actresses can learn from. However, even though we are FANS of BIG AB, all that has been written and has been told through various media over the decades cannot be discounted as just &#39;media hypes&#39;, especially when one observes Jaya Bhaduri in videos, she is a &#39;sad broken human&#39; and as is culturally the norm her obvious anxiety is not talked about and I have a feeling that it is not addressed. And one can detect that &#39;passive-aggressive&#39; aspect of BIG AB and as a fan, that makes me sad and that was obvious during this interview when Big AB and the children try to keep Jaya from expressing the facts of family interactions, while she wanted to keep it real they three of them seems to have a &#39;gang-up&#39; approach to deny. The &#39;love story&#39; of him and Rekha will be one written about in decades to come. Kudos to Jaya for staying the course of this marriage. Don&#39;t make women like her anymore. Such devotion. This was a good interview Simiji.

M

In<a href="">3:56</a> how jaya gave nice smile  on shweta.....people talk on assumption  ,there is everything good in their family

A real strong and dabang lady ....she made a very beautiful family

looks less like an interview more like a family in counselling.. so many unresolved issues surfacing during the interview

Jaya ji is strong and protective of her family, very beautiful family.

I love this family

Jaya took so much nonsense from both her husband and her daughter! They just made her miserable and didn’t give her any respect or any credit for putting up w them. I felt so much pain for Jaya she really deserved better ..one thing I will say is that kids follow their parents and mimic how the spouse threat each other ..so her daughter learned it from her dad to disrespect Jaya. When a child disrespects a parent obviously the parent will lean on the other kids for love and respect. As a result Jaya lives Abisheik more because of his husband and daughter treating her like dirt . A lot of love and respect for Jaya ..

Abhishek is the most fun one in the family

<a href="">21:36</a> wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow GOD spared Amitji&#39;s soul and took his neighbor, that is crazy! same year and day of birth but he died but AB lived. prayers of so many fans all over India, noway GOD said let Him be there. Time has not yet come.

<a href="">15:59</a> shweta loves that! joke on her mom. such a brat lol love them, poor Jaya aunty :&#39;(

<a href="">15:51</a> rofl typical mom &quot;see&quot; soo cuute!!!

<a href="">15:49</a> BEAUTIFUL TYPICAL FAMILY MOMENT WHERE YOU LAUGH AT YOUR MOM WHEN SHE SAYS THE OBVIOUS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT, AND WHEN AB Sr says she&#39;s Claustrophobic in open air also lolz, wow what a typical Indian family, full of love.

<a href="">14:28</a> BILLION DOLLAR FACE! ;D

<a href="">14:30</a> You know I have never ever seen shweta talk before, ( thanks for bringing her onboard Simi) I must tell you her angelic eyes lips and smile lol her teeth, but the moment her dad said, She&#39;s the best mimic I knew there was a devil behind that angel face lol.

Jaya -The Good Wife..

Lol abhishek he’s funny...love him already

Loved it when he said ima professional

@SimiGarewalOfficial - Your shows are very engaging but the blank blackouts are annoying. Strongly recommend editing the current videos and the upcoming ones to make everyone&#39;s viewing pleasurable.

She gets claustrophobic, stops the car in the middle of a highway, yells at the family on the dining table to stop making noise. She&#39;s got severe depression man. Please don&#39;t pass bad comments for her, we can&#39;t understand what she feels inside. She can&#39;t help it.And the sad thing is that no one in her family seems to understand, not at that time when this interview was taken atleast. Look at the way she&#39;s trying to explain &quot;You can feel soneone squeezing your lungs&quot;&#39;. Very close to what you feel in depression.

Amit looks so proudy

Why abhi is wearing nazar battu in his handd😀😀

Sorry there is no translation.
Emotional one

There is no need to talk in English. ..as all of them are Indians. .I think we are more into English mentality rather then hindi.which is our national language..It&#39;s beautiful  Nd nice to talk in.......I like abhishek. .he is really good..but not serious like his father. ..

I love the way Abhishek shows love towards jaya. He is really a true gentleman so calm and quite and respectful.

Lucky people
Simi Garewal interview in English is so eloquent,  non of the Bacchan&#39;s English is as good as Simi. I think she is highly educated Bollywood actress.

Amitabhs  daughter is not pretty Son  is good looking

I don’t like jaya bachhan at all she is really rude reacts quickly mostly with outsiders and her facial expression is always proudy

He cut her hair!?

Excellent, wish this was in urdu/hindi. When Amit g speaks urdu/hindi its seems that an urdu university is speaking.

Finally sweta in appropriate clothes 😂

Anyone 2018

<a href="">15:50</a> I feel so sorry for Jaya. Poor woman. :( and they are making fun of her. All 3, specially Shweta.. what a witch even here.

Long live amit ji
Wow ..grt interview. ...universal truth is....father -daughter bonding  ...Mother -son bonding. ...there is no partiality

Shweta bachan what a transformation

NYC to see family time .. Nd yes Amit ji Nd Jayaa ji both love each other .. and they need not show it in front of everyone .. I can understand that Nd so they don&#39;t do it .. they have so much respect Nd that is visible .. Nd people u can&#39;t expect to get everything in this short clip .. some people don&#39;t just believe in showing off their relation in front of the whole public ..its today&#39;s generation thing .. I respect them Amit ji Nd Jayaa ji

Amitji is so down to Earth

Very dysfunctional family I must say.. they can&#39;t agree on anything under the sun.. and still in complete denial..

Its definitely more difficult being the older sibling. I feel for Shweta. But it&#39;s not that tragic. I still feel like she has a beautiful equation with everyone. But the whole family is Rocking!

Simi grewal speaks awesome english

Even though Abhishek couldn&#39;t do that we&#39;ll in Bollywood..he is very humble and very down to earth person..i am sure no one hates or dislikes him.

Such a tensed interview

Abhishek is a great senstive human being.

<a href="">3:50</a> You meant to say nice things about me 😂😂

Abhishek is still proud his father but he needs to create his own identity..

shweta seems like a bording school raised brat!

Such an interesting artificial family

Jaya is right abt the powerplay thing.. My daughter  does  that sometimes... But Jaya ji is also right that it is the weakness of the parent..

Very dysfunctional family. Each one has a problem with the other. Wonder what it took Aishwarya to try n fit in.

Both parents love Abhishek way more than Shweta...very evident n so is her resentment about it. Can&#39;t blame her. The man has always been very patriarchal.

Adorable couple🤗🤗🤗jaya soo cute and innocent
Shweta is gorgeous

Royalty in true sense

i love amitab bachan he is soo amazing reminds me of my father

Great video 👍👍
she could have been a really big star had she not left acting for taking care of her kids and family ..Just after doing few films she is still praised for the work she did in them..had she continued, the world would have been at her feet..but she decided to sit at home, away from all the limelight, while Amitabh continued to enjoy the journey of fame and in turn gave her a lifelong ache by having an affair with Rekha.. which,  no matter what she cannot change. Still she didnt leave him,always been a support pillar for his failures and mistakes..no doubt she is angry at everyone at this age..This women deserves a lot of RESPECT and SALUTE for not even saying a word against his husband ever as she is LOVES him so much, and neither she said anything against Rekha which can easily show Rekha&#39;s wrong side of getting involved with a married man, while on another hand, Rekha still keeps giving stupid hints and dramas on name of Amitabh just to remain in limelight for her so called MYSTERY love..Jaya has been there inside home, taking care of everyone for years , accepting the painful truths alone and all people say all the time is that Amitabh should have left her and married that shameless home wrecker Rekha who has had affair with Sanjay Dutt, Yash and so many men.

Y wasn&#39;t amitabh asked about rekha

Nice family

The best family ever big B beautifully big in modesty humanity intellectual...true human beings..what a privilege to be kids of such a MAN.

I don&#39;t understand why people hate Jaya ji, or for that matter Amitabhji and jaya ji. They are a couple since a long time have a family, settled in their own way.  If they really are not meant for each they would have easily got separated. It&#39;s not a big deal. Everything that looks on screen need not be true. Even if a couple is ready to adjust with each other it&#39;s only because of their love and respect for each other, nothing else matters.

how i wish abhishek had been a successful actor by now ! Atleast good enough to be in the top 8 of bollywood, if not as illustrious and meteoric as his dad! could sense beautiful bonding between him and amitabh

Abhishek is a cutie baby and has a great scene of humor..I really luv him so much.. it&#39;s the first time I see the whole family sitting and talking about their personal life..they&#39;re so real lovely family..I luved how natural they&#39;re talking and sharing childhood&#39;s random memories...

beautiful family

Family is about security, love and respect. All I see here is patronising, belittling and disrespect especially from Amitabh and Sweta. Abhishek still tries to be sweet to her, probably he is jaya&#39;s only hope. The others  disrespect her about everything. So sad. Especially Amitabh bachchan probably from whom Sweta imbibed it from. Reminds me of English vinglish. Says much about Amitabh bachchan. Such a hypocrite. So concerned about what navya will take about her mother from the interview, what about what your daughter took from you your entire life? Too much to give that lady who gave her everything to you a tad bit respect? Too hard? Cannot stand such hypocrites. Ugh. Still great that Abhishek could subvert from it and not go the same way. Thank you Abhishek. Thank you

Who else almost cried when jaya ji narrated the story about Amit Ji&#39;s coma?

I don&#39;t like how shweta and Abhishek made fun of jaya ji. Though jaya ji and shweta seems to have some problems of their own. Amit ji is really trying to calm everyone down and cut the tension.

Jal rahi hai rekha ki ye dekh k.. u get what u deserve.

They talking with eyes

Shweta looks scary
Jaya is sweet

Bless beautiful family

Interview girl still young
highly educated all of them &amp; still believe in superstitious rebirth stuff !! Lol

Emotional in the end

Beautiful family.. Bless bless 🧡🌷🌸
Beautiful family but the daughter in law Aishwarya Rai is not suited for the family in that place Rani Mukherjee should be in best option

Jaya our Shweta ke bich bahut sari problems hai. Saaf saaf is interview me dikh raha hai. AmitabhJi very humble person he is backbone of the family.

This is so tense

I wish Amitabh was man enough to marry Rekha and not Jaya.

I see tension among all of these four people. Abhishek Bachchan really knows the art of pretending as everything is great among them. However, Abhishek Bachchan, Mr and Mrs Amitabh Bachchan are one of the best people in Indian film industry.

i dont like jayaji. but okay
Jaya is like the typical moms that like to CRITIZIZE their daughters and cite with their sons😑

Jaya Awesome ladySo sweet n graceful n honestAbhishek great Son..great human being

Abhishek great guyHis love for his Mom, Jaya 👌👌I was so touched

This family interview changed my opinion about this family... they are so loving and real...love them all

Hi

Nice èmotive interview... tnx
hello mamI like your speaking style.
&quot;I have never believed I am a superstar&quot;...hahahah...Amitji&#39;s humility at its best :) !!!....

Really u r West actor

Their life is beautiful

Poor abhishek.
Amitabh he was the superstar and always will be no one will take his place love him a lot

Seriously, every family and married couple have psychological problems. Wether rich or poor. In this world everyone has 2 faces. One on t.v and one of t.v. The one of t.v is always reality, and the one on t.v is fake.

V.nice

Love you all.. loving family. Love them all together. Jaya mam is a jewel of the family , beyond popularity , her works are worth to be praised . All time stars...

U all r blessed!
The background of Simi Grewal&#39;s seat  in crochet-Wowaceous!

God is great-His Maya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!_keeps AB going

Sweet Sweta!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111

First time i see jaya bacchan smiling
Most overrated family of Bollywood

Shweta here nd now is really not a celebrity material but now a days she has become too fake nd wanna be..

lol even AB Jr&#39;s family refuses to call him an actor

Have observed what they are wearing in hands in yaa amithab and abhishek boo

The daughter is ugly to look

It&#39;s not claustrophobia, it&#39;s general panick attack / anxiety.

Very difficult task to interview 4 at once when everybody is allowef to talk in between spontanously mastered with bravery ! Specially sound editing done very well .

It was so fun everyone pulling jaya bachan&#39;s leg :p

That&#39;s  your #1 Amit B

I like Jayaji
sir your daughter in law is Ms fake and arrogant

Very very thanks to You Tube to provide us unlimited devosnal and filmy intertainment demonds emmediet. Now it is most popular for all. Thanks again.

You Tube app is vary very popular for all of us. It full fill our all entertaining demands like devotional or filmy demands emmedtly.

Amit himself did not drink alcohol, but made people drunk
Abhishek is such a cutie pie! He has a great humour sense.!👌

Abhishek feels proud of being Amitabh&#39;s son since he was an actor but Amitabh have not been able to say the same for Abhishek unfortunately

Very good interview

It&#39;s so obvious that Amitabh was never going to be the father to his son as his father was. That&#39;s why he decided to be a friend to his son....something he never had with his father. He felt pressured to marry Jaya which he is resentful of.....sad.

Jaya clearly always sides with abeshike. I hate seeing this cause my mom always did the same thing. I was the older one and she always gave her love and support to my brother more. I admire amitabh he&#39;s seems like a good person who isn&#39;t partial to his daughter.

Before Abhishek dated Aishwarya 💗
i wish i could meet you simi you look beautiful till now i like u that&#39;s why i took ur name i want you to make your this official youtube channel verified - King Khan<a href=""> Care

Sirjee was a little apprehensive

i think jaya ji is much more matured than rekhaji jaya ji good womeni amvery likeit ok bay bay

jaya is the witch of this family...look how disgusting she is....they all poor people just bare her

they r fighters..all lovable..god bless them

world biggest superstar

Swetha is nt happy.. n shows faces :P

Amitabh would have never married rekha, Rekha didn&#39;t have the class Jaya has

They all look cery seriuos

I think Shweta Bachchan is brutally honest.

Beautiful family, yes you are .

It was fun

Maggic and funny

Nice family - lovely family and All cute but shweta moreeee ... I love you... good luckkkkk....

lovely family be like that always

simiji this is my most favorite interview.almost like a family chat.loved it.shows how close they all are.

<a href="">8:57</a> - <a href="">11:28</a> OUCH OUCH OUCH!

You can tell both of his children love him.

real.....

To Know The Amit Ji And His FAMILY...A Little Better.....

Wondeful interveiw , loved it especially because it was in english. Thankyou

it&#39;s not claustrophobia it&#39;s motion sickness!!
Amitabh bhachan has the best presence of mind.

nice family-but I want Aish! ;)

@24 Jaya ..... I feel bad
Cute Shweta

excellent
Its a good show but, A bit little slow.

Dear Mr. Amitabh Bacchan, may I please comment that each one of us have got a lot to learn from you. You are indeed a Hero!

A Salute to Amitabh Bacchan. He is a great Man, a great Father and a great Superstar!!!

IT&#39;S  UNTHINKABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TWO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE COULD HAVE SUCH UGLY CHILDREN !EVERY TIME , A SPECIAL ADULATORY  WORDS ARE SPOKEN IS A MISFIT. OUT OF BILLIONS OF GENTIC POOL WHY SUCH COMBINATION WAS CHOSEN, BEYOND ONE&#39;S  WISH AND COMPREHENSION . THE FINALITY  IS THE CHOICE OF THAT SUPER-INTELLIGENCE.SO IF YOU MARRY A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, THERE COULD BE ODD IN FINALITY
There needs be an updated version of this interview, with Aishwarya and Aaradhya on the couch.

I don't understand anything and I'm a big fan of Indian cinema. For 40 years, put it in Spanish.
s that much

Such a graceful family

Very genuine and down to earth family! Talking about kadu tel (mustard oil) in such sophisticated interview. Pretty cool !

Such a geniune  family ......!

Have a great resume
Rekha and him would have been a great couple, I feel sorry for Jaya though doesn&#39;t look like he cares that much

nice family

great family!

nicce

Is Shweta&#39;s last name Nanda, bacuse she got married?

TO: American and European  celebrities, I implore you to take a good  look at this family.They dress well according to their wealth. Do you, American/Canadian/European celebrities really think that you resonate to be with the middle class and the poor by dressing like derelicts? You&#39;re not fooling ANYONE with a BRAIN!!! Go home Ben Affleck. Go home Matt Damon. Go HOME TOM HANKS. GO HOME, TOM HANKS WIFE. I don&#39;t remember Tom Hanks&#39;s wife&#39;s name. I simply know that she is mediocre elitist actress, who&#39;s married to a left wingnut actor. That is her only BIG claim to fame. I hope you left wingnuts appreciated our support of you. We, THE LITTLE PEOPLE, made  you wealthy beyond your dreams, but you failed us. Enjoy it now, because are going to take it all back. YOU used US and failed us.

The tension between Jaya bachchan and sweta though

what oil was he talking about that was good. I think he said it at <a href="">3:24</a>

Amitabh Bachchan is still deeply in love with Rekha. He does not want to admit it because it will obviously hurt Jaya and his children with Jaya. Unfortunately, Amitabh is stuck with Jaya. It clearly shows that Amitabh is secretly suffering and unhappy but he puts on a brave face in public. How sad !  Wish he met Rekha before he met Jaya. Rekha and Amitabh would have been such a beautiful couple !

Absolutely magnificent ~ Salute to the Bachchan family :-)

Amit_ JI Will always be Number 1, But now is SRK Time.. 

BAHUT OHCHHEY HAIN.

Best

What deems a language to be considered a National language. I feel that English is the unifying language in India. Whether it&#39;s broken English or fluent and proper English the fact remains that the majority of its people know English in one form or another. Some choose to express themselves in it and some don&#39;t all of the time, depending on the situations. Simply put, it&#39;s the unofficial popular language.The other prevalent languages and dialects serve to keep people apart, although not designed as such.All of the street signs, a lot of the billboards and advertising are predominantly in English for a reason.Imagine if you traveled across the country and the street signs were in the local vernacular lingo, there would be massive confusion any time you needed directions. So English remains the cementing language of communication. It is generally considered the common medium of instruction in schools and colleges, universities and so on. That&#39;s all. I don&#39;t see the need to doubt what&#39;s obvious except if you choose to live in denial.

they are so disrespectful to each other especially jaya bachan...such a shame 

Is English the official and national language of India? Just asking because everything is always in full English

SABKA MANGAL HO 

the great great indian thinkingi am very poud of  indian

nice to see this

She  is  so  nice  grateful  and  respectful.  I  like this,  when  seeing  so  many unrespectful   and  dishonest  Indians  myself.  This  is a  breath  of  fresh  air.  Great father &amp;   great  mother.  She  teaches  him the  right  way.  Aishwarya  is  lucky  with such a husband. Aishwarya  is  very  proud  spoilted   person,  but  I  do  think  she  is elegant.  But   she  is   really  lucky  at  the  same  time  as  well.  Such  a  wise  man.  I have  seen  soo  many  bastards  walking  around  in this  world.  You  guys  are  soo lucky....she   is  a  great  girl  (daughter).
seelochniemoonessar


this wasn&#39;t very long ago and look at how nice jaya looks with her hair done and everything. naway days, she looks like a woman who has lost her mind with her hair sticking out of every possible direction.

how ugly is his daughter sheesh

I so loved this interview with the Bachans especially because it was with all of them and in English

Beautiful family.

what an ugly family.

Nice family

very  intiligent  &amp;  great man  amitabhji
What a lovely family.

bachen is our hero god bless his family and jaya she is a woderful actor god bless her

Jay abchchan look at ugly  face she is always hv fight she dosnt know how to laugh...she is stupid

There used to live a normal, happy family and then one day Ash happened to them...............

Mr. Bachan has the happiest family I have ever seen



Pakistan should invite Amitabh Bachchan to Pakistan, he has a lot of fans in Pakistan too including me, that way he can see his mother&#39;s birth place as well like many of indian super stars who were born or their families﻿ in Pakistan. i would pay anything to see him, but i don&#39;t think he wants to be target of numerous Hindu parties in india by coming to an enemy country. Anyway I Love Amitabh Bachchan.

thank yoe. veri good film. I am veri like family Amitabh Bachchan ....





Nice family

is it me or does this interview seem tense

where rekha

They are adorable!

I feel bad for jaya ... She should  nothave given up her career for her kids , mother hood is not about only giving , today she would have been more respected and confident unlike  what she is today .............

Bb budda hoga app ka baap
What&#39;s up wit all the hate towards Bachchans. They r v down to earth...Amitji is a legend..hav u heard SRK ever saying tht he is nt superstar?

amitabh bacchan is one hell of a dominating man..not allowing to speak jaya bacchan

amitabh bacchan is fake...flirt man in the film industry...

Loved watching it! 



the Bachchans are mean. Jaya ji is just awesome!

BiG B

I like their honesty... just like a normal family.  

You and me both know that &quot;these people&quot; are just the same as usual, two or three losers with fake accounts that hate........Bachans 

Nice Fmly...........

it only after salman khan&#39;s wanted movie, u guys have started hating abhishek bachchan, why?

what a lovely family......what his wife said....nobody really knws amitabh. thats true..only his family does....

India is not having Love affairs with Big-B with Big-D  .  Useless people like you may have your Love affair wtith Big-D Please do NOT let hi show  how to be a TAX-CHEATER ??  and May be Rekha-Cheater???

You dont comment on this is Abhishek and Shweta is  family way please abhishek is a struggling﻿ &amp; good actor

But still nice family!!
Big B  and Jaya doesn&#39;t have goodlooking kids!! 

Does his  daughter sounds like katrina kaif or it is just me ?



dont comment on anybodys family this way please abhishek is a struggling actor 

the only person who was graceful in this interview was Amitabh Bachchan!

abhishek is strong, what a joke!!!!! that is the funniest joke i&#39;ve ever heard!!!!

OMG!!!! I&#39;d never talk about such embarrassing things that my siblings did to me  when i was little in an interview even if i was paid to do so!!!!

i thought abhishek was the only child!!!!

shweta and abhishek were so ugly when they were little!!!!yuck!!!!

it&#39;s hard to believe that a loser like Abhishek Bachchan would be born in a family of talented superstars!!!!

not only shweta...but also the ugly loser abhishek made me puke too!!!

the only one is nice is shweta....

Good see whole family together

What was up with the slam at 1:20?  I didn&#39;t understand it.  Certainly, if it was a joke, she didn&#39;t take it well, and Amitabh seemed unamused.

beautiful family.

Shakespeare to be paraphrased: &quot;Sweet are the uses of adversity&quot; - it certainly brings another dimension to the unity of the family in adverse times. Another person of the same birth date demising is surreal. It teaches me that Amit Ji and his family have no false notions of life and its complexities and prayer is the greatest healer and higher than that is the resolve that Amit Ji took never took to take its fruits in vain.

Joya looks so pretty here . Wonderful ppl beautiful family

Nice family...! Good one. Thanks.

Moms are usually partial to younger borns and sons. And it&#39;s worse when it&#39;s a younger born son! I feel bad for Shweta. Maybe she was a brat to Jaya because Jaya was partial to Abhishek.
