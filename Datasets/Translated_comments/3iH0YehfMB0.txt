This story was written by paula Hawkins.....But they didn&#39;t mention him once.......its bad.....so bad....copy cat

Pari is love yaar

AGAIN A BOLLYWOOD GARBAGE

Timing kya h release ki?

Parineeti is a grt actor wow

This is how Bollywood ruined the original pieces and ruin everything beautiful! Bollywood is the evil factory that destroys their brilliant actors and promotes some so-called artists, and it always will be.

PARI&#39;S TALENT FLORISHING 😍😍
BEAUTIFULLY acted by pari

Remake of movie of same name

Ye bhi remake kar diya. Kuch nai hoga bollywood se ab. Bas remakes and biopics. Trash.

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they ctrl c+v the English one 🤷

Parineeti is such a bad placement to Emily Blunt...Parineeti looks n acts terribily ..This movie is gone get a 👎👎👎👎

Looks very dark and promising

Nice loved it

Lots of love pari you deserve much more

One more flop she will give

Lovelyy movie it looks

This looks like a copy of &quot;The girl on the train&quot; 2016 starring Emily Blunt. Please come up with a new fresh story. Just dub the English version in Hindi

@PgYAHollywood (The Girl on the Train)

Boooo.....boooooCopy copy copy ....2016 may aaye th ..... Hollywood flimSame title same name....Bollywood may copy krne k alwa kya krga

Nothing can beat the book. Pareeniti can&#39;t play this role. I&#39;d rather see kirti kulhari

Without even watching it can tell this is a copy of Emily Blunt&#39;s  GIRL ON TRAIN 🤷‍♂️😂

that makeup and those expressions..so amateurish..not convincing at all

Yeh web series hain yaa movie
Bus copy hi karni he na

You&#39;re not telling us the full story? How is this possible?

we didn&#39;t ask for this. the original movie was great... why remake it Netflix?

Copy of same name English movie.

Hey what is this?? This is the 3rd movie based on the same novel!!!!
Idk why this movie exists ..... Emily blunt killed the role 😂 how they gonna make it better ?

I watch this teaser atleast twice in a day. It&#39;s one of my favourite novels The Girl on the Train&#39;s Bollywood movie adaptation and I can&#39;t keep calm. Netflix please release the trailer ASAP.

Copy

Can Netflix only take copied movies?
is this the same story as the book by Paula Hawkins?

Fascinating...Can&#39;t wait for the Black version. Hope it&#39;s INTERNATIONAL.

Is this a Hindi remake of the original The Girl on the Train 2016 film?

Is this based on the novel?

What are you doing to make this bawasir???????
Ummmmmm already been done...

Waiting for thiss❤️❤️❤️
@netflex: we would want to see Parineeti more often.. czars of Hindi film wouldn&#39;t give her much chance

So excited for this adaptation of the famous novel.

Same name film is made in Hollywood years ago. Now copywood copy this film which is completly shooted in London. What i point here😂😂 kyo karo apni paisa copy paste par waste... Mai orginal hai dekhuka.... Kamse kam yeha india mai shoot kartha tho dektha...

These are the few copies.... This film with this name was thought of by Hollywood years ago... They are also copying this movie and shooting it in Europe, who is watching...🤣.... This is... original is available so why see this fourth copy...
Kissan ekta zindabaad
Yess finally m soo excited for this movie😍 the time i have read this book was so waiting to see it on tv😍😍😍

Do they have any original movie plots in Bollywood? it&#39;s simply copycatting Hollywood to  produce one flop after another.. Parineeti can&#39;t be Emily Blunt... period

Flop

I am sorry Emily Blunt.

She fuckng thinks that she can match Emily blunt. Rubbish.

Garibo ka Emily blunt🤣🤣
I&#39;d rather watch the original one..

waste-of-money-and-time

Enough is enough fast upload trailer plzzzzzzzzzzzz

Hollywood&#39;s copy

Type &#39;wow&#39;and tap above the &#39; t &amp; y &#39; and reply 😁

Bollywood here goes again . CHEATER

I am hopeful for this Adaptation... Let&#39;s see😬🖤

Why are you ruining a perfectly good movie.

And this seems Parineeti chopra is on 🔥

Where is other girls?

It&#39;s based on the novel The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins. Then was created into an English movie. Rachel is the main character. Now copied by our producers here because they are out of content. I mean for how long can they make dance videos and make their characters speak vulgar.

fav book❤️
Remake to India me Banate.🐺

Someone pls tell her to take the train back to where she came from..can&#39;t act for peanuts

she just can&#39;t act..pls don&#39;t even try..you are nowhere close to Emily Blunt

Parineeti Chopra very nice actress and she is very talented so I&#39;ll waiting for the movie and Parineeti

Love you Parineeti I&#39;m biggest fan of you.❤️❤️
The girl on the train . I&#39;ve already seen that movie ......Is it the same ????? Novel based , Indian version...

Bgm is fully copied of Hollywood

9945979544

Did this movie have a NEHA CHAKKAR song  ??

Let&#39;s see

i have seen the original one, and do&#39;nt wish watch this..... Pari and netflix  u both need to work hard to get good content.

atleast location india rakhlete bhai

Super exited......😍😍😍
Her wound and makeup is so artificial

Kb tk Hollywood ki nakal kerti rahogy 👎👎🤣✌
Bollywood is copywood 🙄

The book is an incredibly good read. This would be a great movie to watch.

Should have kept Hindi name atleast &quot;Ladki Railgadi mein&quot;

OOF THIS CAST &lt;3

Plus if the names are same , then Tom killed Megan !!!!

You all are gonna hate me but her ex husband is the murderer 🙃

Why can&#39;t they make it look like happening in India. They are going to make all characters as Indians but movie location in London. Whyyy?

Everything literally everything is same except language in my pov😂

Paula hawking book 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥🔥🔥
Hollywood remake

I have read the book, basically this is Hindi version of English &#39;&#39; the girl on the train&#39;&#39;

So good pari it&#39;s rocking

ANUSHKA SHARMA LITE 😂😂

Nice video.

actually excited to see how they catch that nerve wrecking gripping narration, described in the book, in the movie.

Emily Blunt was awesome in the originalIt would be tough to beat

Khtrnaak lg rha ❤️
Is the story based on the actual Novel and the movie staring Emily Blunt?????

Remake of English movie. Why bollywood doesn&#39;t have their own story.

Sorry to say, but my hunch is that the book is far much better than the movie 😅

Emily Blunt always for this role

Anyone has original A Girl On The Train movie link, I would rather watch it.

I am excited ❤️Have read the book, watched it&#39;s adaptation, still looking forward to this.

Mujhe bas is movie ki cinematography pasand aayi baki sab kuch bakwas hai

suck it just sucks!!!! No One No one specially pc is not even a nail if Emily Blunt in the movie

I love how there is the name of three heroines on the title!

Parineeti looking fab 🔥 Can&#39;t wait!!
Make some of your own too...
What a garbage !! Why remake ?

This is a remake of the Hollywood movie of the same name starring Emily Blunt. Where is creativity?

Wow this looks  great

After ishaqzaade pareeniti got the chance to show her immense talent which was not able ro come out as she was nor offeres good films. Thia movie will either break her or make her.

Another copy cat has entered the market
They copy chinese movie. Bolliywood always copy for everything

Ek aur copy, atleas movie ka nam to change kr lete

Paariniti chopra is back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ she is such a fine actor
My crush is back with a bang🔥🔥😎😎

If anushka sharma were instead of Parineeti then it will be more more flourishing. Pls don&#39;t hurt by my opinion it&#39;s just a simple point of view🙏

why london or any other foreign country? why cant bollywood shoot movies in india

felt like she was playing JOKER

This is on a novel

background music so critical

Emily Blunt

Is it a remake of the English one. If so sure no one is watching this given the original one so popular.

Hollywood movie ka remake  hai re  ye 😈😈😈😈😈

Omg I really cannot wait to watch this movie 💕💕💕 Parneeti Chopra is one of the underrated actresses and much much better than all the big well known actors. Can&#39;t wait. Much love to Parneeti challenging herself with different roles ❤️

Netflix shat on us again with a remake.

After watching this ,I gues Indian cinema is changing 😅😅😅😅

Will Watch For Parineeti mam Only.............

When DIL BECHARA came wasn’t it a remake but people in sake of subscriber start appreciating that movie and as Pari is alive so they will be against when she will die they will call it a masterpiece😡😡😡😡 the reality

I have read the book and watched the hollywood movie of this story cant wait for this one❤️

Copy

Something good

Where is avinash tiwary

Didi ji flopped.....
Just imagine, this movie could have made in some South Indian beautiful urban area with the sub-continent context. The character Megan could have had an interesting plot according to the Indian rural culture, and yet they made the set of this movie is just like the Emily Blunt version. Could have just dubbed the movie to Hindi.

If you&#39;re just gonna replace white skin with brown skin, what&#39;s the point?? This movie should have been set in India and Indian locations.

Waiting for parineeti Chopra New movie

Let&#39;s see how she portrays Emily Blunt

I think iss movie me psycho character play ki hai❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌👌👌👌👌👌
bad makeup bruises

“Confidence is everything. Confidence is what makes that simple white tee and jeans look good.”🔥🔥🔥

You are copying Hollywood!!!...make something original and then you will realize that you have no identity.
Naam to badal dete copycats 😂🤣

the only thing i&#39;m curious about is...who is gonna play Megan form the original Girl on the train movie? Those who know the story, know Megan too ;P

She luks so bold nd beautiful....

Oh my god another re-make 🙊😆😏 come on bollywood dont keep on dissaponting us 😩

This will be a most disaster of the year bcoz of the star cast

This looks like someone fixed parineetis face to Emily blunts body. Not impressed...already.

Bollywood really mastered in copying South Indian &amp; Hollywood movies. Not even a single good movie based on their dumbhead! ☹️

O teri......wowww yrrr ....

How could you be so heartless ♥️

Am waiting to see the talented n gorgeous aditi Raohydari  in this movie

Netflix has become a garbage dump for crap movies. This looks nothing like the original.

Why does this hopeless Parineeti keeps getting movies?

Copied

One more remake

Nice

Ye Bollywood copy cat hai 😂😂😂😂

I won&#39;t comment on her acting capabilities yet as the film isn&#39;t released. But we very well know about the book + the movie which has EMILY BLUNT in it and when we say she has done phenomenal in the movie we mean it. Idfc that this is an Hindi adaption or for that matter of fact why do we even need an Hindi adaption when subtitles exist- but please stop pretending that India has run out of stories. Making of such movies somehow make me feel that we have no scriptwriters left to write a first hand Indian script for us and that to me is pretty unacceptable. I urge directors to use Indian stories- we are a population of 1.7 Billion and you&#39;re telling me we don&#39;t have a single story that&#39;s worth making a movie on?

Parineeti is the damn good actress....💝

Starting kaa intro music kahi sunaa sunaa lag rhaa hai 🙄
Why does this sounds reminds me of an another movie

Wow

Omg! So many wounds on her face yet make- up completely fine. Ha bas insaan marte waqt b khoosurat lagna chahiye- Bollywood&#39;s logic.

Does anyone have the guts to turn a 1 minute call into an hour long call without telling anyone? If you have the courage then tell me.
Even the Hollywood one was bad why they made it in bollywood too, only book was good🤦

I thought Shraddha Kapoor

Parineeti is more promising than many actors rn

OMFG WOW

I hope pari gives 100% to the movie

Waiting for this

All the Best ❤️

I watched this movie in English 😒😒😒

Her facial expressions isn’t matching the character she is playing Please stop spoiling a goof movie by remaking Instead appreciate the movie which is made in India simple one also is fine no need for masala n double meaning jokesN stop too making remakes from south movie too If their isn’t good to make movie please give chance to whom who deserves 😡

Copy paste 🤣🤣🤣😃😃😃 movies. Bollywood is copywood movies 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😡😠😠😠😡😡😠😡😡
Why tf Bollywood garbage keeps appearing on netflix movies

Do Bollywood people have no stories of their own left? How long will you keep watching South and Hollywood dubbed films?
Love For All, Hatred For None❤

Happy birthday to me😟Vai log mujhe  birthday gift chahiye1 k subscribers challenge 😟Plz vai log kardo😟Love you all YouTube family❤

Why?There is also the film &quot;Girl on the Train&quot; in 2016.

BTW I have already watched &quot;the girl on the train&quot;

Shot in foreign. I didn&#39;t expected that

1k krwa do plz 800 sub chahiye
People talking good about her acting really blv in love at first sight....... Coz her acting is not looking convincing but then we should have better trailer to understand that.

Netflix: we wants to invest in garbageBollywood: yes

pariniti chopra😄👉Bollywood to train😁

These fuckers gonna ruin the original.

Title should be &quot;the girl on mumbai local train&quot;

Emily Blunt was outstanding in this movie

Come on Bollywood!! Bring something original to the film industry rather than copying/stealing ideas from other places..!! NotProudOfThis☹️

Another copy

Well the Emily Blunt film adaptation sucked so really not expecting much.

Sasta Copy paste from hollywood

The trailer is good

I wish her career will reach heights after this

When copied, the name of the original was printed.
Indian krni thi to atleast India m shoot krni thi na. Indian touch k naam pr bollywood faces aur hindi h bss😭😭 I

Now they comparing Emily Blunt and Parineeti Chopra.

Shame

Prosthetic makeup is just Indian level lmao

Looks like the Remake of -The Girl on the Train (2016) starring Emily Blunt 🤔

Why I do I feel like it’s inspired by memories of Alhambra

Parineeti really seems promising. Love her.

More talented then anyother

So they remade it as Indian version but she doesn&#39;t live in India... okay. Indian version is in London too.

KGF ke time per kuch nhi chalega😂

Background music  stolen from marvel&#39;s movie trailer...

Kya C.P. thi ye???

It&#39;s been 5 years I have delayed my song. Finally did released it🙂 . Show some love to my song too😀 GAL  SUNN YU 😀😀😀😀😀

Was it necessary?

Parineeti Chopra such a nice talented actress especially in hasee tho phasee movie

&quot;No one copies as much in an exam as he does in the industry.&quot;
Hope they don&#39;t ruin the beauty of the story of book

Ye hui n baatAisi movie chahiye mujhe bollywood meWaiting.....Hindi me dialogue hain na??
Movie seems completely badass please watch....
The book is already beautifully written

The teaser was more like THE GIRL AROUND TRAIN STATION

Kuchh to India me bana lo

not remake nieter adaptation but look like copy

I&#39;ve lost this novel on the train then I&#39;ve downloaded it and read all the novel and then downloaded the movie and watched it 😂

When did Netflix start making remakes?
Better watch the original one with better actors

Copy! Copy! C🤣py! Phirse Hollywood ki copy.

Ab yeh kid movie ki copy hai?? 😝😝

🤣😂 atleast change the name shameless

Why do these people remake Hollywood movies these people don&#39;t have brain and on top of that they have taken this girl like seriously Parineeti  come on Bollywood  make some original movies always making remakes of other movies and iam sure that they  have ruined this film

Makeup: lol 😂🤣😹No comparison with the great Emily Blunt..👍👍

itna ganda makeup! Not good enough Netflix! was expecting much better!

This is worse than my online classes😵

Ooh this trailer is #39 ON TRENDING

Copying kaise karte hai Bollywood :- yes

Boycot sabkuchh boycot sabkuchh boycot bollywood forever

Netflix lowering it&#39;s own value by filming these kind of stupid movies.

That wound makeup looks so unreal

Some have copied from South, some have copied from Hollywood, some have copied from Korea.
Parineeti Chopra looks like the heroin in dark 🌑

Yuk 👎
This film has already existed 2 times in Hollywood.....we all have seen this movie many times.....what&#39;s up guys?????

initial thought: from which movie it is copied/inspired from?

Backwas , another let down

Parinitti।
I love parineeti.. Very well acting.

Now Netflix guys also seem to be making fall movies.
Or what did you find??? JuniorPC Ghaatiya over acting 🥱😴 R.I.P to dis movie 🍿
I love you Parineeti. I&#39;m SO HYPED.
I hope it&#39;s not a remake

Wow after very long time I&#39;m seeing her..

I hope they have  Rakhi sawant as ghost without makeup 😅😂😂😂  RIP

Avinash Tiwary is here.

&quot;ON the train&quot;?!!

Two words “ OVER ACTING”!!
Cinematography feelss like Hollywood ❤️
Pari❤❤❤
YRF is a thief company...

Sometimes you can make a movie script using your own mind!
Good and all the best but i hope this film not will be copy of Hollywood movies.

Bollywood copy every thing, 😁 many time with South indian movie many times Hollywood rest from other parts of country, world, list goes again and again 🌎😁 even cloth, makeup,

She is not on train but she is everywhere

Tbh at first I thought it has some international cast....but this also seems ok

Seeing the thumbnail I can tell it&#39;s makeup and ketchup on top 😄

I can bet on it that she won&#39;t  be able to fit in the shoeems of emily blunt

Parineeti you&#39;re fantastic
Again an shitty adaptation from West! Emily Blunt 🖤 They should try on some projects like Ludo. People will appreciate that.

Wowww!!! Exited for this...

Isko yhi jgah milti h train.

So I have read the book and let me tell you that the guy who is the ex husband of parineeti in this film is the killer

When you watch  the original... You never think of watching it again!!!! At least background song of heartless should have been added!!!

Seriously amazed performance ❤️❤️
It reminded me of her train performance in Ishaqzaade 😂😂😂😂

I will not watch this movie, the original had a really good impression me when i first watched it.. this isn&#39;t a mystery thriller to me any more..

Very slow acting
Awesome 😱🙁😰😟😖😞🤯😡😛😴😪😌😮☺😐😙😅😉😅🤣😂😄🤣😁😊😗🤗
There is already an book and movie on it 🎬 Bollywood just keeps remaking

What on earth they remade it. Do they have no sense on project s they spend money on. The person watching the add will immediately realize already watched. Do something new.!!!

How long will this woman spend producers' money for her hobby?
I was also waiting for good projects for parineeti Chopra and she is always doing good I like her movies like hassen to phasse, namaste England, jabariya jodi ,ishqzade, shudh desi romance,kill dill,daawat e ishk ,golmaal again,meri pyari Bindu, kesari, the girl on the train ,sandeep aur Pinky faraar, bhuj the pride of India,takadum,animal

That makup of injury looks like cake on head 😨😂

Excellent acting
Sharam ani chahiye copy movies karte wakt
<b>i cameo in this movie</b>

Wahiyaat
Who&#39;s gonna tell her that she&#39;s got ketchup on her forehead.

Parineeti mam 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Why they have to be on foreign trains , why can&#39;t they choose Indian trains .

Great actress
Is the same story by Paula Hawkins?

Girl is on the train nhi in the train

And one more came...🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ab hum arjun reddy,fault in our stars ka remake dekh hi chuke h toh why not this too

Nice there is no sex in this
Train performance is better in ishqzade..

As nh10

Is this movie a copy of an English movie of the same name?
No one:Literally no one:<b>Netflix spreading gyaan in comment section</b> 😂

Telegram jindaa baad
LITERALLY 1%😇 PEOPLE WHO IS READING THIS MAY YOUR PARENT&#39;S LIVE MORE THEN 100 YEARS😍🙏🏻  AND HAVE HEALTHY LIFE GOD BLESS YOU❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kr li copy novel ki mil gyi shanti....Ab log kahene wao what a movie ... Bullshit actress and bullshit movie teaser. Novel is best. Please don&#39;t use novel uSe your own imagination Mr. Writer of this movie.

Avoid it

Remake again 😂😂Kuch bhi bna do log toh dekh hi lege...

made garbage again
Want some time off? please read the book . You will feel much better.

Man the make up for that injury is so bad!

EMILY BLUNT THE QUEEN VS parineeti chopra

Train means only indian train no foreign country train...

3rd class

No no no
Instead of making whole new movie they could just dubbed it because clearly they are going to do scene to scene copy.

Just copy paste.. waste

For God&#39;s sake.... Bring something New 🙏

Thuuuuuup
Jhatu

Apart from Parineeti, no one was found? Aditi was given the lead role.
This time u killed it

I make SLOWED and REVERB VERSION of HINDI songs! ❤️ Please support me and my YouTube channel! 🙏🏻☹️

Wanted to see this in cinemas after boards but

This will the one if the best films of bollywood

Nothing like Emily blunt&#39;s acting but pareneeti is really pulling it well

Spoiler: Rachel&#39;s husband is the killer. Now kill me. Kay byee.

Her husband is the killer.I&#39;d already read the book.

The novel had such beautiful description of UK. The Hollywood movie kinda destroyed that with American set up. I hope this movie shot in London lives up to the novel.

Ohh.. Definitely a good content is coming up!

Again a Remake of Hollywood.....😕

Please everyone watch original❣️❣️❣️❣️👉👈
Hopefully this film is turning point for her career.

Kuch tou original karoo bancoudoo

Is it based on Paula Hawkins novel??

Again a remake 🤯🤦‍♀️
Boy: will you marry me  ?



Girl: do you have a house ?



Boy: No, but ?



Girl: do you have a BMW car ?       



Boy : No, but ?



Girl : how much is your salary ? 



Boy : no salary, but ?

Now Boy talking to himself : 

I have one villa, 3 plots, 1 ferrari, 2 porsche, 1 Lamborghini, why I still need to buy a cheap

BMW, and how can I get salary when actually I am the boss.

People are commenting spoilers. Just to let u know. DON&#39;T SPOIL THE EXCITEMENT.

Is that zombie movie 🤔

same expression during the whole trailer hope not the same case in movie..

Although it is a remake , but since it is produced by Netflix i hope it will be good and different from the previous one.

She looks too clean and put together. Emily Blunt had a drunk look in her eyes..Sure they overdid the messy eye makeup with Parineeti but she just looks too put together.

Waiting for it....All the best parineeti..Love u

Intense

Seems like this movie is copy of the 2016 released the girl on the train 🤔but we shouldn&#39;t say anything not until we watch the movie.Even if it&#39;s the remake, if the movie is good I&#39;ll praise it. &quot;WHY TO DENIGRATE&quot; evry bollywood movie

Will not match the mettle of Emily blunt’s Girl on the train.

Hello NETFLIX  Please inform me when your DAD Telegram will upload this 😁

Looks promising

I didn’t watch your movies earlier! You came to spoil Netflix now? Don’t worry i am not going to watch you here as well 😜😜/

Parineeti and Emily Blunt, what a stark contrast. Not looking forward to this one bit.

No matter how old I am, I will not copy Bollywood.
when i listened to the starting tune , i thought it was the song &quot;your eyes tell&quot; by BTS!!

OhhF...another adaption from HOLLYWOOD..

Shitty expression are coming from pari

Copycat valo ka bollywood 😒

Something tells me I&#39;ve already seen this movie in English

I think this movie Copying from american dream

Aah ! I got some vibes of Vidya Balan from this teaser.

😂😂😂😂😂

Once again copy_paste and also artificial drama..

Very promising👌
Location has also been used to show some creativity.
Wow. Interesting
Maar gayi kya parineeti
Parineeti is undoubtedly a great actress with a national award in her 2nd movie! Wrong choice of movies sidelined her...Give her a scope to perform well, we can see the rise of a phenomenal actor.

Seems JOKER female version. 💯
Is this a remake?

I was like let&#39;s watch it and then I saw parineeti and I was like,&quot;ain&#39;t no time for this overacting&quot;

the english version is one my fav. movies. emily blunt killed it. lets see how pari fares. tho how will they fit this in indian context? the train and everything looks foreign..cant relate.

The film will completely flop.
Perineeti did a great job 👏 Akhir hain toh woh Priyanka ki hi behen 😇

Could you not change the title atleast?On searching the movie the English version is popping up

why parineeti ? you don&#39;t have good caste. trailer me hi mood kharab kar diya.

All the best parineeti looking forward for something gr8😘

The book is awesome. Hope the movie turns out to be good too.

Fresh fresh

Parineeti Chopra = 240p Emily Blunt.

Kahin ye wahi to nahi.
Saw the print after a long time
Arey yeh toh emily blunt thi is movie me toh... yeh toh hollywood ka film ka remake hai. Omg

Another blatant copy !!! I won&#39;t watch the trailer

Trash just like her sister Priyanka

I hope people will support movies like this rather bashing coolie no 1 😂😂 . Parineeti looked promising 👍.

Thriller ?

Lol... Kuch to original bana lo..... 😐

This is going to be so interesting! Pari mam worked so hard for it. ❤️

I can&#39;t imagine anyone but Emily Blunt for this role.

Why? Why? Why? Why, my lord? Why in the seven hell?

Anybody else thought of “the flight attendant” on hbo max as soon as they saw the trailer?

Why are they copying movies a lot nowadays ??.

There already exists a movie. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a remake. I do wish Pari would do great in this 🌻🌻💜

Another remake
I just hope she could pull this offf......And not destroy one of the greatest movies...

She has peecee but still doesn&#39;t get much support.......but she is amazing actor.....all the best......we will support her surely

When you people stop copying Hollywood films. Name and Bgm total copied and i hope whole script will also be same.India has so many stories but still we are doing copy paste.

Looks Hollywood level.. 😍

Who is casting director? How can they compare Emily blunt to parineeti. Parineeti is more like a replacement of Abella Danger.

Yehh pari is back

Just a copy version of the English one typical Bollywood

This is best acting by pari

I have seen this movie..Emily Blunt was quite stunning in this role... Hope parineeti will rock this.

Setting this outside of India doesn&#39;t make much sense since we already have that version.<b>A localised version set in India would have done wonders.</b>

😂

Book itself not good

Get ready to watch super flop actress Pariniti.... I never forgot ishakjade n namste ingland type movies...

I was watching &quot;dasvidaniya&quot; it was released in 2008. I was loving every moment on the screen and performance by actors. Today all i see copy paste and stüpïd movies.

I will watch the movie for Avinash Tiwary

Seems like The Movie &quot;The Mid Night Meat Train&quot; isn&#39;t it?

I don’t know how this video got more likes...

Full Copy of Hollywood movie with same title....What to say now..!!

BGMCopied 🚶🚶
Already saw the original so not interested [thumbs down]

Hollywood copy

There is no point in adapting a story if you are going to make it similar to previous adaptation. The title, the setting every thing looks similar to the Hollywood film based on same book. It would have been better had they Indian-ised the story.

Music is given by Pritam Arijit sir ka song hoga lazmi. Arijit k fans Like kren

How does she get movies after soo many flops??? Uday chopra? 🤔 😲🤤

Huge fan of Parineeti! ❤❤ cutest girl I have ever seen! 💓

kuch  zada hi foreign content promote kar raha hai netflix tu, original aur highly creative content bana indian creators ko leke esp indie ones aur bana content in wide range of genres

make HBO level quality content by hiring Indian Direc, Writers (esp. Indie ones), and make original and creative stories and explore all genres (except romance) 

like: Fantasy, Scifi, Action, Animation, Drama, Art film, Epics, Horror, Thrillers, Mystery

i have seen the old movie but this time i am just going to watch this movie only for one thing❤️ &quot;Avinash Tiwary&quot;  just gonna see him after bulbul waiting for so long... love his acting😍🔥🔥

God no!😩 Bollywood stop ruining movies for us!! 🙏🏻

is it based on the book by Paula Hawkins ?

Parineeti on train looks like smiling instead of being curious.. worst acting ever

Interesting teaser 👍👍

I have read the book, please don&#39;t destroy it.

why??!

Bollywood will not shy away from its remake action
Yaar itni achhi book hai The girl on the train plz uska kabara mat banao I still have that book nd it&#39;s my favourite one

C&#39;amon  Netflix don&#39;t ruin that masterpiece <b>the girl on the train</b> is my fav and now again this bollywood loosers ruining masterpiece. Just stop it Bollywood.  don&#39;t waste our time and money on your poor copied stuffs.  don&#39;t even refer it as adaptation after copying everything frame by frame.

I hope this movie justifies the novel

Animal and this.....good going girl. All the best.

what the hell why is bollywood trying to spoil this movie too wasn&#39;t fault in our stars already enough?

I hope this is not a remake of 2016 “The Girl on The Train”

Music v <b>Avengers Endgame</b> ki copy hai 😁😁😁
This is the copy of Hollywood movie the girl in the train.Nice.....copy more.... Don&#39;t make original movies.

Alia/deepika would be great in this role

Why you need to ruin another movie ? The original was class apart n with this one having parineeti, my expectations are zero ! Some things should never see light of day...

The cringe of the comments is killing me

Useless remake. Copy of Emily Blunt. When will Bollywood stop copying????

Ek aur flop... Parineeti at her best..

I see only women listed in the title 👏🏼 and 👏🏼 I 👏🏼 so 👏🏼 here 👏🏼for👏🏼it!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Awesome👑🔥🔥
Looks like remake of crime patrol dial🤣

Let&#39;s hope this original film wins few oskars!

Parineeti is a real &amp; rear telent only if Bollywood can use her...all are thet focus on her weight and comparisons with Alia the Genius Bhatt...

Yet another men violence, women helpless and sea of feminism type movie.

Film is adaption of Hollywood movie and this film&#39;s characters exists in London. Man what&#39;s the point of making this film.

Why is she still on the train?.. It&#39;s bonkers!

Why we bollywood is not able to create new stories... Again copy from hollywood

pathetic....another garbage in Netflix india

Whyyy do we have to always ruin masterpiece

Her ex-husband, whom she divorced, is a murderer and has hit her on her head. Now watch the movie.
Waaah bhaiya,full Hollywood baji..
Tough to see

The original swedish movie that hollywood adapted was very very good. Will be difficult to match that one

Superb pc❤️
Not fair....again a remake..... don&#39;t think she can match Emily Blunt&#39;s level.....we should bring out more stories like harshad mehta instead of making remake😠

I don&#39;t understand, stealing the story with the title too. What purpose does this gonna serve. Netflix behave yourself, May be try, &quot; the girl not on the train&quot;

From the teaser it seems they are making a ditto copy which is a recipe for disaster. Should have set it in Mumbai local we can literally see what is being cooked in people&#39;s houses from the train window lol.

I read this a few years ago it was good then watched the Hollywood version on Netflix which was trash and now this...Netflix is using the old Bollywood formula of remakes. For eg. Badla. The only difference is Bollywood copy south , Netflix copy west...😁😁😁

Parineeti Chopra was most underrated actress of Bollywood🌼

parineeti is underrated!

Why Netflix why ?

So I refreshed my self after watching trailer of  original version

I have done something new...🙏
Let&#39;s see how much they ruin the original .....

Already seen and don&#39;t want to see it again in different version.  isase achha to dubbing kar ke release kar dete🤣

Omg copy fazool

Everyone is talking about parineeti and here I&#39;m waiting to see only avinash tiwary in this movie.. Must watch his two amazing films.. Laila majnu and bulbul

Lost  girls and love hotel kinda vibe

Can&#39;t beat the original

Seems like nice❤️
This is going to be a copied Hollywood movie. So, not interested.

This movie same as that of the Hollywood one!!!?????

OK BUT I HAVEN&#39;T WATCHED THE MOVIE BUT THE BOOK IS STILL BETTER

okay ...it&#39;s official, Netflix does make remakes .

Remake

Hope movie is in English

another copy

Another flop film of Parineeti... Overacting ki dukaan

Pari is back

Hope Parineeti can pull of a performance close to what Emily blunt did with this role

It&#39;s a remake of a Hollywood filmSame movie same title

Hollywood remake

First remake. Brother, now you have to do the same. Even the name has not been changed.
The book going by the same title written by Paula Hawkins is awesome. Hope this movie is good too.

It&#39;s a remake of the same name.. Don&#39;t know what point in making it again in netflix

Yeh kaha se music copy karte hai... Trailer ko bhi music copy kar k dal diya.... End is near 💥

parinity ..you will rock..now..

Why does bollywood have to make copy of every Hollywood film

Why is bollywood always coping original english films and remaking them? 0 creativity , typical copywood.

train wali ladki ka pati villain hai.

Its Parineetis husband who did it!

😮it&#39;s a murder mystery.

If this movie is also shot in USA, what is the benefit of watching it if you watch it in English?
Isn&#39;t this based on the book?

Sushan singh Rajput  pasand tha

Ohhh!!!!! I already had forgotten that there was someone called parineeti chopra in Bollywood

Dear Netflix, it really wouldn&#39;t hurt if you put &quot;series&quot; or &quot;film&quot; on your trailers/teasers, come on.

wow 😳
Try to do something new on your own rather then coping

This and Animal.Parineeti has some amazing movies in her bag right now!

Netflix following Bollywood trend of producing unoriginal movies

I am eagerly waiting for this thriller experience which stars Parineeti Chopra in lead role 👍👏😊

I&#39;m here only for avinash tiwari

Seems frame to frame copied

It was one or two movie in which she accidentally acted, why don’t they keep learning to act even off camera.. you lucky got the chance make most of it.

why why why!. Why Netflix would you do this to my favourite book?.

Kidney touching koi nai bol raha

Another english movie copy. Do these guys ever get original?

Fantastic 🙏👍
I have already read this. Parineeti is a fine actress👍 but still it&#39;s impossible to root her for this role. I too like her n it&#39;s not like she  can&#39;t do this role. I mean after reading that novel I can&#39;t say that she was the perfect choice for this while on d other hand Emily was looking fab. Anyways hoping good for this one👍

Expecting A strong performance by parineeti

and here we are - another crap

Another day, another ripped off concept from the west by Bollywood.

Remake hai ve...

good

Did anyone here actually read the book first?..

This is the original movie with Hindi audio and show it.
Somehow they&#39;re gonna ruin the storyline to the next level..

This is the next time you will destroy the movie..Khud ka dimaag nahi ke bollywood ke paas..
Why Location is UK or US ...just like Badla...cz in india we don&#39;t have good houses near railway line? Or like Romance she saw in the train..we don&#39;t find in india.

I read book and blunt&#39;s movie as well..she was phenomenal . Parineeti looks promising..

is this a remake of the Hollywood version ? or just the name has been copied

The English movie is phenomenal performed by Emily blunt....let&#39;s hope we get the same from Parineeti

NAI MAZA AYA

Copy banana band karo...
Why this teaser music sound familiar?

Who believe she can act this time better🤔🤔

Come with something original Bollywood!! You are making a Hindi adaptation of an English movie which itself is an adaption of a book!!!! Agar ideas ki kami hai toh band karlo apni film Industry!! lets lope that at least the location of the movie is different.

The audacity of makers to replace Emily blunt with Parineeti Chopra!!😂😂

The makeup looks bad. That&#39;s already a turn off for me.

They will not even think about making an adaptation from the best of Indian books like immortals of Meluha or any book of Devdutt Pattanaik. But bolloywood makers love the processed recycled plots.

Oh another remake?-_- why watch Netflix when u can watch  originals on tv.

First senen like joker
Come on don&#39;t say this, its a remake of original hollywood film &#39;The girl on the train&#39;

Alia would have nailed this.

It looks quite similar like  &quot;A girl with a dragon tattoo&quot;

Flop

Can we get anything original? Oops no way from Bollywood

Hbsband iz d killer. Oh sory

This movie will be a trademark in her acting career!  Happy to see this!

Is this the remake of Hollywood movie of the same name 🤔🤔🤔🤔

Netflix on a road to perdition with these *d*it’s in their projects,

Its Sydney Sheldon&#39;s  novel

Great... waiting for it

What&#39;s the point of this film?

Bollywood k ghatiya actors are gearing up to ruin NF India.

Another CUT COPY PASTE 😅

Emily Blunt ki movie hai with same name , uski ka ganda version bna diya hoga bollywood walon n ...

Emily Blunt ki movie hai with same name , uski ka ganda version bna diya hoga bollywood walon n ...

please be good!

Hollywood movie like

Welcome back Parneeti! You deserve a role like this.Hope u r gonna smash it.

Pari&#39;s gonna rock this time! 🔥

Why? Why? Why?

Its copy past: Trailer from the film released in 2016, Acting Story, same to same copy, Bollywood, some gangs now have no story line, just copy paste from South and West.
Fire🔥
Is this remake?

This looks totally awesome

I love Pariniti❤️
Best Wishes Parineeti and the team ❤❤

Is it movie or a web-series?

Again copy but it will be important to see whether Parineeti Chopra will be able to match Emily Blunt.
I wanted her to do quality films again and she&#39;s doing it ....a huge pari fan 💜

Ahh bollywood . Only thing they new is to copy good movies and turn them into poop.

Arjun Kapoor will also be in Kia 🚆 train 🤔🤭
Ah...wrote a report on this book...i remember now

Its like I am watching i spit on ur grave movie trailer but bollywood version

I have made a reaction video of KGF chapter 2 teaserPlease watch my youtube video

With all the remixes and copies from the States and South, I&#39;m wondering if Bollywood suddenly thinks that they can do &#39;better&#39; than the original 🤔 😳

KGF sound
Shit 🤮
Atomic blonde .. copy no no inspired 😂
Copied from Hollywood movie the girl on train

copy paste
Cheeeee

Why are they trying to ruin the classic book!??!! Guys please read the book before this. The book is a masterpiece dont let this ruin it for you!!

Why do they even do this. Stupid big-ass production companies

Idk why she is so underrated,  she is one of the best actress who can emote. Loved her in Meri pyari Bindu.

She is soo soo underrated

This is based on the book by Paula Hawkins having the same title

What&#39;s with that chings secret Schezwan chutney on her forehead 😆

For sure this will be a horrible remake. That&#39;s what Hindi movies are famous for.

This is promising but the lack of respect shown to Indian authors when it comes to movie adaptation is somewhat prevalent.

Super excited
Which movie/book is this based on?

Hello Netflix I want to direct movie ,, I have also interesting storylines ,,,,, please help me ,,, I can show my talent ,,.  Please help a common boy with big dreams

Feeling so good for Parineeti after reading the comments praising her!☺️ Pari is going to rock it.🔥

One like for parineeti chopra ❤️
finally Parineeti gets a good project. Wishing the film turns out to be a great one.

One like for parineeti chopra ❤️
VERY POOR PROSTHETICS......................SCARRY

Faltu

Why????? Why so many remakes! We all hv watched the movie! Fucking re release it, why re creating it?

What did you like about the original script?
The girl on the train is book ryt?

Another year another remake for Bollywood Jo film already book par based Hain uspar Bhi remake 😔😔 pls sudhar jau Bollywood and make something original

Tough to fill in for emily blunt

Not relatable at all. Wait, lemme get a bottle.* chugs a boatload of gin &amp; tonic *Yup. Now it&#39;s relatable.

i&#39;m gonna must watch this ❤️

What original is left in Bollywood?
I m so happy that finally she got a script worth her talent ❤️

I read this book 4 yrs back😁

Sorry Netflix it&#39;s Mukesh Sah Baniya

Please don&#39;t ruin another great movie and book. Love parineeti but Emily Blunt can&#39;t be replaced. Why does Bollywood have no new ideas? This is just sad.

Abhi Aalia ,Sara , Jhanvi ki koi movie hoti to sare critics aa jate tareef karne but is movie teaser ko kisi critic ne appreciate nhi kiya🙏🙏🙏🙏

Tomato Ketchup on the forehead looked very delicious....

Thumbnail mein itna ganda make up Parineeti ka  hai ....aa thu

By making remakes of haraam films, they consider themselves as 'Tees Maar Khan' and the public... Oh brother, kill me... kill me....
mein to shayed time travel nahen kia hain na meine aisai he trailer dheka ta aur wo bhe parineeti he shayed us mein ti i am kinda confused right now

Given that movie is based on book Still will be different one

Who is bloody director of this ,it looks exciting

No match for Emily blunt ,that movie is not good I don&#39;t know why bollywood are making remakes of flop hollywood films

Watch the girl on train..this is remake..

Pari❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Its a remake from Emily blunt&#39;s movie very good movie must watch ❤️❤️❤️

Parineeti looking like Martha from Dark❤

Hollywood: Based upon the novel by... Bollywood: Based upon the novel and movie of the same name in hindi

Why Every suspense movies teaser/trailer start with that same sound..  ting ting ting.. suuppp

Emily blunt look so different (ugly).
emily blunt ny kya thk sy ni kia tha ?

Minute silence for bollywood for copying effortlessly....

Have been waiting for this for so long ❤️ Hope the film is good because Parineeti can act!

Best movie

Why would you go and shoot the movie with the same name where the original was already shot? I mean.. It would be cheaper if you dub the original with Emily Blunt into hindi right!!

I confident about pari&#39;s acting

I was looking for Emily.......oops...wrong channel😶👍

Copy of hollywood movie that performed by actress - emily blunt

She&#39;s the Arjun Kapoor of Female Actors.....

Such a shame - Its a copy paste of Hollywood movie. Don’t put your level down.

Parineeti&#39;s ex husband is the killer in the film

LOL

But why???

Again a remake

By the page pic I thought maybe it&#39;s zombie movie, then I read parineeti&#39;s name and thought why will they make zombie movie 😅.... BTW India hasn&#39;t made any zombie movie which is popular enough, I want to see a zombie movie made by India. There was an ad. of thumbs up of ranvir Singh and the zombies were like real zombies. I think India should try to make zombie movie...

teaser is awesome. all the best pari ma&#39;am!

I just can&#39;t imagine parineeti as Rachel.. However, looking forward to this film since may 2020

Looking interesting

Hey my love has finally arrived in the digital space❤️❤️❤️
I fucked my mother in the movie ???
Why is this Movie exist? There is already a famous movie Starring Emily Blunt besides the famous books itself. Go spend your money on something original NETFLIX

can&#39;t wait too excited ❤️❤️
I was waiting for this movie from past 3 years😭 can&#39;t wait for it❤ Pari will always be my favourite💞❣

@netflixindia Netflix baba improve your diet a bit and include Parineeti more in your movies and shows. She deserves much more. Is there any talk in the society?
It&#39;s thrilling

Looks amazing! I hope it’s not a riff off from the original Girl on the Train staring Emily Blunt. Well can’t be too hopeful because this is Bollywood where plagiarism is just the way of life, but still looking forward to this nonetheless

Here for the very lovely Parineeti ❤❤ wishing her all the good luck !

She looks like rani mukherji

Does Bollywood will ever stop copying and create their own stories... what’s the point of making this when Emily Blunts original movie “The girl on the train” still exist.

The girl on the train 👧🚋

The book was AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

Bgm look familiar.. Is it inspired by endgame?

Pari long time no see😁😁
I have read this book. So excited for the movie. Yayyy

I love the novel, I love the Hollywood adaptation as well, let&#39;s hope this adaption is also as good .

I loved the book....can’t wait for this oneee

Parinetti got a national special mention award for her first lead role 👏👏👏

Pareneeti,aditi rao hydari,kirti kulkarni my godd casting!!! 🔥🔥... Really excited for this one! ⚡🔥

Is she she the same actress who was awarded to loose weight at an award show 🤔

The girl on the trainThis story was in English textbook chapter 7 standard 10th.LmaoHope movie&#39;s story won&#39;t be same

I like Parineeti... will watch for her!!

Read the book people!

All the best pare❤️

isn&#39;t this copied from the English movie &#39; The girl on the train&#39;?

I hope this movie works for Parineeti. I found much more potential in her compared to Shraddha or Alia when they all started.

Please don&#39;t say this is the copy of Hollywood&#39;s the girl on the train

Hollywood movie copy...

One more remake

Again its Hollywood copy paste movie. Think new Bollywood think new

Watch the original! Mast rho!
meh.

Omg I just got finished with the novel , lol .

Oh ok looks interesting 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Want to see...something looks attractive
Hope it will be good . Technically even if it is a remake its of a movie which is itself adaptation of a novel . Just hoping it would be a remake only and not copy . Just one thing that it should&#39;ve  been on  Indian location instead of some foreign country  it would be much better .

What was this?? Neither intriguing nor interesting

And that&#39;s how you ruin an amazing masterpiece by making its remake.

Interesting...

Kangana Ranaut should have been cast in this movie!It would have become a sure shot super hit!

The teaser is looking awesome and powerful! I m sure the trailer will be 10/10 superb.🔥 And Parineeti ❤️

Another copy paste achievement of Copywood.
😮😮😮🔥🔥Looks like Amazing 😨
Parineeti killing it . Looking forward

what was the reason behind taking pareenti as a lead actor?

She is such a brilliant actress... ❤

Movies get better if there is Netflix in corner😁😂

Wow Parineeti ❤️
Superrr interesting! And pari is rocking 🔥❤️🔥🔥 ALL THE BEST❤️
This is going to be 🔥🔥🔥 <b>Parineeti</b> ❤️

U have scars on your face with blush on your cheeks ! Did the makeup go wrong ? Or the story depicts such face ? I don&#39;t understand

Flop !

I can't see
it was her ex husband 🙂

I would prefer the original movie version rather than a copy paste type of thing ..

Where was Kirti Kulhari and Aditi Rao Haydri in the trailer?

I wanna watch now this movie

Now I wait, I am hot, what are you doing to people?
There is still power to create something original in Bollywood now.
Abe bilkul same banani thi toh Hindi dub kardete baa
Ek aur remake....Hollywood ki remake h ye..

At first, let&#39;s copy lyrics...second, let&#39;s copy the song itself. Abhi toh pura picture hi copy karlo

aaw tum bhi aaw

Cheeee

bollywood or hollywood ?

It would be good and parineeti is surely gonna be a knockout but at the end of the day its a fucking remake

Wow awesome‼️😮best
Wow! Can&#39;t wait😍❤️
Gone Girl[BlueRay]  ctrl+c | ctrl+v | Rename[F2]  =&gt;&gt;&gt;  The Girl On The Train

What a fantastic actor parineeti is ❤

Broooo I just finished the novel!!Coincidence

Why this title sounds so familiar?

Emily blunt is better

Copied

I read the book it&#39;s awesome

Whenever bollywood makes movie with a female as a lead actor believe me  its main story starts with the actor being sexually abuse.Thats why bollywood is such a lame.Male dominant industry

EXCITEEDDD 🔥
Kachra.
Netflix hindi content is not impressive

Copy of Hollywood

I swear that this hug will not be like the book's Hollywood movie which Maa Bhen Karne Wali Hai... Paula Hawkins herself said, Bhen Baas Kar
Kirti Kulhari ...go rock it girl. M sure u will give a splendid performance.

NopeShe doesn&#39;t look half as intoxicated as she should if this is from the same bookShe looks too sober and like a sleuth of some sortWhereas the original protagonist had a dark unbalanced uncontrolled life where even she was doubting her own realityParineeti doesn&#39;t look even drunk or  lost forget anything elseTotal injustice to the roleAgain... all this IF this is the same movie from the same book

I&#39;VE READ THE BOOK AND OKAY, NO OFFENCE, BUT, YEAH, BOLLYWOOD- WILL WE EVER GET ANYTHING ORIGINAL? THEY FREAKING RUIN EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE FIRST FICTIONS I&#39;VE EVER READ, BUT, WHY!

Is actress ko dekh kr he dimag kharab ho jata hai

I know the murderer already. Damn it

Worthless actor

Pakka flopped
this is underratedthat is underratedunderrated is underrated type moron comments, incoming in 3...2....

At least no more mannequin like jhaanvi 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks for ruining another masterpiece 🙂

A better substitute would be watching the Hollywood version of Emily Blunt in &#39;Hindi&#39; audio format. Just a simple advice!

The commuter

Bang on
Kuch to original kar le!

less like Rachel..more like monjolika 🤣
I saw the Emily Blunt version.

Wow!. Seems More like its A crime Stuff.. Just What We Needed after so long Time ⌚😍😍😍...

Are behen, itina make up laga ke itini acting mat karo

Ahh and ppl r hyping her here in the comment section 🥱Just because she is underrated doesn&#39;t mean u hv to hype even poor performance of her&#39;s.There r aditi and kriti in the film, they will overshadow pari in it.

Hv watched the original, she seems so unnatural. Hope I will be proved wrong when the movie will came.

I don&#39;t know why but I think Kareena would&#39;ve been perfect for this role.

Parineeti is back as girl on the train

Love Is That Beautiful Forest.. Where Brave Tigers Are Killed By The Attractive Eyes Of Beautiful Deers..!

What’s the point of this remake ? Location bhi abroad main hain not India . It’s accha Hollywood version hi dekh sakte hain na ?

cringe
Remake pe remake

Oh sorry...but i can see only Emily blunt in this role...she was awesome...this is embarrassing

Netflix waste of money with parinèeti chopra

Is this movie based on the novel  &quot;the girl on the train &quot;

I hope parineeti does well in the movie. Emily blunt was incredible and terrific in the English version. She is really natural in that movie. Hope so this one is good. But one thing Emily can&#39;t be compared to any Bollywood actress.

High expectations this time!Dear Netflix please dont let me down this tym!Yours Sincerly, A student who is not attending online class becoz of u!😊

Parineeti Chopra, Aditi Rao haydri, kriti kulhari &amp;&amp;&amp; avinash tiwary looks promising 😍💃💃
Movie khonor kotha moi Kali vabisilu..aru aji teaser dekhi golu.  Love to Parineeti...

Lack of acting skills. Natural lag hi nahi raha hai

Parineeti 🥰🥰😍😍😍
Please the book already sucks and the English movie too.... don&#39;t really want a Hindi version of this now.

Wait... Is this based on the novel by Paula Hawkins??? Which I just completed!!!

Are bhaiDuring lockdown movie watching was everyone&#39;s main interestThis even included girl on the train.Exited to see what ours is going to look likeIts quet natural and digging the trailer by the way😃

parineeti is damn good❤️
this is going to be release on my birthday ..

why remake this?

I think, I have read this book. I&#39;m not sure but I guess.

90% brainless movies come from hindi ..with less acting skills, item dance , and trying to copy some english movies ...over all heavy risk watchng any hindi movies ...there are 10 % movies are good

Everyone must try this book&#39;s audio version, you will feel how that character is feeling like you are present there

Faltu Chopra
This is from the novel or I am just assuming 🧐🤔

Movie looks so amazing ❤️ parineeti’s expressions look so natural and thriller 😍😍

Take a Book, make a movie about it. Then make a movie about the movie in another language, then another .. keep going.. bollywood such hard work to give Homages 😂😂😂😂

After seeing teaser I can say that ,this is only over acting in this copied movie name .

Thank you Netflix for giving this chance to Parineeti , she is such a good actor  but sooo underrated. She deserves it , bollywood would have never given this chance to her , her movies are also sooo underrated . Bollywood would promote SOTY2 (ananya pandey the great) but won&#39;t promote or even talk about parineeti&#39;s brilliant work as an actress , I am so happy she got this script , I have read the book already and the teaser looks good , waiting for the trailer Netflix ❤️

Paula Hawkins wala hai kya?

So you want us to pretend like we do not know that her ex husband is the culprit and also the woman has to look drunk af and not put together to make us question her sanity.Thank you

She is literally running in every flim....think

Year @netflix why are you wasting money.
ugh 😩

Aree yaar last mein iska ex pati hi saare kaand karta hai... I have read the book

Who said that i dont want to work with tv actors🙄🙄🙄🙄

Is this a remake of &quot;Prathi Poovankozhi&quot;???

Earlier we copied Tolly wood and now we&#39;re copying Hollywood.. progress made 🔥

Atleast yahn hi chal jaye privileged actress...😂😂😂

Another remake...
Pari is my biggest crush ever, fell in love the time I first saw her in 2011. I have wasted 4 years of my life while in college for a girl just because I felt she looked a bit like Pari. Now I am happily married and have a son but the massive love for this girl never going anywhere for rest of my life. Hope my wife wont ever find out this comment😂😂 , I absolutely adore Pari..

Thank God this much has come🤣🤣
Looks like frame by frame copy of the original one. lol

Rip acting

Bollywood people have no use except theft.
Based on Novel right ?

I just somehow thought that Kirti Kulhari is the perfect fit for the Bollywood version of The Girl on the Train.

Why ? Why though ? They will change a good novel and a movie into awful movie. What kind of retards will watch this crap ?

Bus remake hi banao tum log,
Nothing is cringe than Netflix is replying to the random comments😷 Netflix wat is this huh😂?

Why isn&#39;t it India based if it&#39;s an indian remake

Seems nice.. hello guys.. checkout my channel for entertaining short films.. with good content.. please do visit ❤️

Parineeti is criminally underrated. She deserves good scripts.

Copy Cats!!!

Okay chill pari didn&#39;t got fair opportunity till now even if she&#39;s doing an adaptation let her be...

Most awaited movie..I am interested

Since i have seen the original this doesn&#39;t intrest me at all !

I have watched this movie already 2 times. Thanks for saving my money netflix.

Parineeti is lub😍❣
Crush 😍
Some different mistakes👍
Why set it in London? Already one movie starring Emily Blunt already exists, and not to mention it is so good. Then why set it in London, it will be compared brutally.

I know it’s a remake we never asked for but again what’s the point of REMAKE if you have the move “set” in London. I mean for that.... don’t we’ve  Emily blunt Version!!!.....

Something worth her performance 👏

After a long time, we get to see Parineeti  onscreen 🙏🙏🙏

Parineeti&#39;s acting is damn good ✋💥💥💥💫💫
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Is it a remake???

I think Anivash Tiwary is also in this movie. Can&#39;t wait to see him !❤️

Why Netflix? Why?

Iske bad national crush ho hi jana h pari😍😍👍 my crush my dream girl..... Lv u
Brilliant comeback

Looks like Pari has done a good job. Let&#39;s see hope for the best 🤞🤞🤞

This is a book by Paula hawkin

Hollywood movie

pari is love ❤ waiting for this one ✌🏻🤞🏻

I hope this will be a turning point of her life ❤️.Love you babes

As I know, she is better compared to most of the actresses in bollywood nowadays. Hopefully, she get proper recognition for her performance in this.. Nowadays, actor and actresses fame is consider in how their movies doing at box office. I want this thing to change, people should really appreciate the actors and actresses who are really capable enough to do 100% justification to their characters. There is still many actors who can act well but hardly get recognition.As a malaysian, I really love bollywood movies but nowadays I felt like these directors are choosing actors based on their look, fame and popularity but not by their talents 😣🤦‍♂They are so much underrated actors out there. They should get proper chances in this industry too.

never try the copy of hollywood indians be your sell that will be much better for you

Watch the orginal movie and then lets see..who scores or screws!!!

Indian version of The Girl on the train hollywood movie (2016). Emily blunt played this role.

The original film is a pure gem and we know about remakes in bollywood. I hope they don&#39;t ruin this

please dont tell me they created a desi Emily Blunt here

Maybe a &quot;Train to Busan&quot; copy

I&#39;ve read the book... I&#39;ve seen the movie... And yet iam too much excited for this... I really want to see how we have adopted it, in our version of storytelling..... 🤞🤞🤞🤞

Remake of Hollywood flick and looks worse than original. Bollywood never learns🤷

Nah... I would have preffered &quot;Laundiya Sawar Trainwa Mein&quot;

Another bollywood dumpster on NetflixCan we please keep bollywood away from Netflix

Parineeti in her role is looking as convincing as the scar on his forehead🤭🤭

Well.. why to make the remake of It&#39;s English plot if you again want to show everything with english (western) background? For Acting skills? Thode dhang ke under actors try karte.  Indian version ke liye, The girl on the LOCAL train accha hota... Bollywood copy bhi dhang ki nahi kar raha hai.

I will still prefer the book.

Bollywood should have tag line Bollywood the copywood

Don&#39;t spoil a fucking good book and story for me.

netflix india has been taken over by the nepo kabal

1. Girl on the train2. Animal3. Farrar4. Saina Nehwal 😍😍😍😍😍Pari back with a bang 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bollywood you have nothing new .... You have only  Copy and paste content... The girl on the train is a 2016 Hollywood movie

Another remake... 😊😀Bollywood k pass original kuch nhi h 😜😂

kb tk bollywood will continue to copy....the original movie's fun is also getting updated...inko kuch ni aata
she&#39;s talented

Even the original wasn&#39;t that good. I doubt the remake will be worth the watch.

Pari is better tha sara ananya

Copy of Hollywood movie script with so much acting skills 🤣🤣🤣

Eager to watch aditi rao hydari in form.

I was waiting for Parineeti&#39;s hard hitting performance for a long time now. Which i hope will be fulfilled by this movie. Looks promising!!

2 floppies together

dont ruin another classic

Netflix is revolutionizing the Bollywood industry. Earlier Indian genres of movies were only romance and action. But I hope at the end of 2021, Netflix will change our industry.

SOS ! Remakes have reached Netflix guys hurry we have to save it ,send them back to bollywood where it belongs.

Is her face stuck? The expressions dont change at all. I mean at all. Literally😂😂😂

Nice Promo

The Girl on The Train. Idc if it&#39;s a Bollywood version but count me in!

Why does it feel so strange?What the hell happened here?It hasn&#39;t happened yet

Did y&#39;all change the plot?

Uffffff.....

This is Parineeti’s NH10 moment. Rooting for you girl!

Again Hollywood ki copy... Let me tell u guysss.....the girl on the train is a book and there is a Hollywood movie in it about that book...and now they are remaking it ....the book was much better .

Parineeti is one of the most talented actors we have today.

Shocking but not relatable yet

What&#39;s the name of original movie? I want to watch it.

is this one of paula hawkins book made movie?

I hope this doesn&#39;t disappoint me. Cause the book was amazing

why adapting foreign author book . When you have so many beautiful indian writers.  Now look the problem lies on us hum hi sale chutye h. India have so many beautiful author.  And we could adapte from there but nhi Hume to Hollywood ka copy krna h.phir koi deserving author india m hoga to hum usse support nhi krege. Or jb vo depress ho kr suicide krlega to phir blame game khlna shuru krdege.  Is lye chte ho ki bollywood remake or hollywood ki copy krna bnd kre to jo original h usse support kro

We love you Pari
Where the hell is Avinash Tiwary&#39;s name on the title? Just because someone is not as popular doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll foreshadow him. It&#39;s in the description only.

Parineeti❤😍..excited
another inspired or copied storyline from Hollywood, The Girl on the Train (2016) starring Emma Watson.

Parineeti is Perfection.

Parineeti is always on the next level!!! ❤

Finally saw something of this movie. I waited for so long. Happy to see Pari again

Parineeti chopra is underrated. She is a brilliant actress. Can’t wait for this❤️

Has anyone read the book?

Great! Another Remake. Well done Bollywood 🙂

Already watch the real one,,

What did you do brother?
Bruh the book is so much better, first Hollywood ruined it and now Bollywood 😩

Another flop by flop actress

Watching pari from dimple chadda in ricky bahl or zoya in ishqzade or gayatri in shudh desi or in hasse to phasse  she is so natural if u compare her with alia or shardha its just about some bad selction hope to she her back like she was in her initial carrier.

It&#39;s a remake of an American movie right?Again Bollywood copying Hollywood.

People internationally are going to be SO confused by this when they see it pop up on Netflix 😂

OP...🔥❤️
The fact that not one critics has tweeted about this film proves that how less support she gets from the industry. And how underrated she is.

Is it the remake of &quot;Gone Girl&quot; ?

Couldn&#39;t shoot it in india??

Chalo at last soms content, thankyouu for finding Indians worthy to watch goood dramas 🥺😒

Just like us man's love for you 🙏❤️
BOLLYWOOD IS ONLY COPYING FROM OTHERS MOVIE BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL TALENT TO WRITE THE FILM SCRIPT

Is this an adaptation of Paul&#39;s Hawkin&#39;s book?

Girl on train is movie That shows perfect acting plz don&#39;t make such master piece movie Bollywood

Parineeti Chopra Looks Promising Excited To See Her In Such A RoleLove you Netflix India ❤😀👍
I am here only for Aditi Rao Hydari

Emily blunt lite ❤️
Is this another &quot;remake&quot; of a Hollywood movie....

Parineeti chopra seriously Netflix ?

One of the most bold &amp; under rated actress of Bollywood... 🔥

Remake 2011 english Movie starring Emily Blunt

Bgm is same as tenet bgm

Yess.. Looking forward to watching this movie..😍😍😍😍😍😍😍.. Luvvvv u Pari😘😘😘

all the best Pari!   haven&#39;t watched the original version! just waited for this! 💖💖💖

I think I must get a subscription now... 🤔

Plz like &amp; Share for our pari😍😍
Why I&#39;m imagining Anushka Sharma in pareeniti&#39;s role 😅Oh Nh10

Fun fact is I thought they will use Indian trains as well ! Lol...

Doens&#39;t a movie already exist which is based on the novel which I have read and seen the movie also, looks like Netflix India is nothing now but a place for mainstream bollywood to dump trash movies

I love you pari...
I really like her expression in 20 second VideoVery well done parineeti

Ctrl C + Ctrl V.....TYPICAL Bollywood Style

soo artificial acting and pathetic makeup . what were they thinking while doing this?

Salo engrezo in the train hota h🤨🤨🧐
I can tell from now it&#39;s going to suck

Seems intense!

Where is the train😳😳

Comments appreciating actors in a 20 sec fleeting clip are PAID. YouTube is taken over by paid comments.

BGM is inspired(copied) from avenger infinite war

I&#39;ve read the book. Why is the location London? We can just watch the Emily blunt one then

I&#39;ve read the book. Why is the location London? We can just watch the Emily blunt one then

My wait is over! Parineeti!!!  💜💜💜💜

<b>WHO WATCHED THE ENGLISH VERSION OF IT</b>

Inspired from the book?

But why ???🤔

Why even bother doing a remake of the English version

Let's go with my sister, after a lot of bad things, how much has been achieved 😁
I was waiting for this film since a year. I remember this film was going to release on 8th may 2020, and i had strong plans of watching this film with my family. I knew parineeti is going to do something great in this movie. This is a must watch movie. And pari I LOVE UHH😉

lameAss bitch

It is based on a novel😎

Hopefully, This will be a turning point in her career.The promo looks promising.

The girl&#39;s special 😂🤣

After coming in Netflix platform Bollywood movies look like Hollywood movies

So that&#39;s it??? Now you are not even gonna change the title of movies that you replicate????

Interesting

Petition to rename Netflix India as Bollywood 2.0 😂

Looks like suspense and thriller

ORIGINAL IS BETTER THAN THIS REMAKE

They could have set it in actual india ...with hindi speaking characters ...would have been more interesting...I&#39;ve read the book and seen the Emily blunt version too

I&#39;ve read the book. Let&#39;s see how it goes on screen.

Yahoo couple 💗💗☃️
Hope it&#39;s not a remake of &#39;the girl on the train&#39; starring Emily blunt

This book is one of my favourites...So please!! The trailer looks quite promising and the performance by all the actors better be good!Cause I loved this book when I read it and maybe I will love this film once I watch it! So Netflix And Bollywood.. the contract of all the things is on you!😂

It looks like that Bollywood is thinking that their teaser will also be in trend and get millions of views like kgf chapter 2 teaser  .......😆😆    .... bhul jao ..lullo  .....ni milrahe 100 m views ..

Haven&#39;t seen Parineeti playing a badass, since Ishaqzaade.... Welcome back, Girl!! ✌️

Why this lady as lead..just why. She is worst in everything. Acting skills, personality, looks, figure all. And let me tell you My brother used to study in the same school with her. He tells everytime that she is always faking infront of media. She is bad evil

Wow , this looks cool. Will be waiting eagerly

Everyone here talking about pari, no doubt she looks promising, but what caught my attention was the name of  Aditi Rao Hydari, hope she has a significant role to play.

Amazing Super Fantastic
Can&#39;t wait to see this thriller

I loved Parineeti in Hasee Toh Phasee. Her acting was phenomenal in that movie. So I know she can act well but I think she hasn’t been choosing the right movies. This looks promising!

Parineeti, you&#39;re one of the finest actresses 🔥 So excited for this one.

Parineeti&#39;s First time on-screen THRILLER Movie!!!!!.......Can&#39;t Wait!!!!!!!
Is it &quot;NH10&quot; part-2❓😜😜

i watch this hollywood version.

Netflix is retirement home for some and for others there&#39;s always zee5 alt Balaji 😂😂😂😂

She gave so much time to this project, unlike her previous movies that came back to back. I can feel that it will be a game changer for her 🤩

Parineeti chupra my fav❤❤❤❤❤
Parineeti is under rated..she is no doubt talented

Oh god another copy,🥺

Ni ce

Why is this being made, isn&#39;t there an better English version available?

By Paula Hawkins.
NETFLIX IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN MY GIRLFRIEND 😉😁
If anyone didn&#39;t read the Book its adopted from than just go &amp; Read it ... It&#39;s Amazing

She is thousand times better actress than her contemporaries. But still underrated. I hope with this film she gets her due.❤

Atleast naam to change kar lete 🙄

Worst flim

Now this can be compared with Hollywood  level. Hopping a lot🔥

Aise trailor banane se behatar mat banao yar. Waste of time

Doesn&#39;t she look like Martha from Dark a bit🤔

dafuk i thought it&#39;s gonna be a horror movie. bitterly disappointed. make moar horror movies, @netflixIndia

Nice

When you have already read the book 😂

Another remake of Hollywood Movie. They have good writers but why  don&#39;t they make movies based on desi stories rather than copying foreign stuff.

This is of no use, it has over activated us.
Another day, another remake!! Please make something original

Ye bhi thik h

Yes, let&#39;s have another adaptation/remake. Smh...  Are we just done with original stories/screenplays/lyrics/music??

boolywood become box of copy

Netflix no. 1 ott platform for hindi spoken audience, keep up the Good  work👍🙏

Now this is go something amazing story . Good luck ❤

one more remake. kuch toh original bana lo bollywood.
