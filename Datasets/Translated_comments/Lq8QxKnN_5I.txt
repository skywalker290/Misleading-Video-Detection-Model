It’s geometry dash not just “a square game”

Still remember this era of baldness 

<a href="">6:25</a> Death Grips mentioned
<a href="">1:37</a> you don&#39;t know how hard level, Npesta was playing is.

His hair looks  like de gea
Pewds basically went “This is the impossible game and this boy is speed running it”The GD community: 

He seems to be speed running some game. Damn why is he going so fast? Me who plays gd: ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)

Pewdiepie: laughs at npesta&#39;s reactionAlso Pewdiepie: &quot;speedrun&quot;&quot;the impossible game&quot;Has probably never beaten a demon

<a href="">8:56</a> didint know you was draining like that

NPESTA IS NOT A SPEEDRUNNER AHHHHH

moosic drippings
I just remembered this video because of the random chimp event. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Thing is, I thought this video was 6 years old or something. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s so recent...

Bro the majoroty of comments is about pewdiepie calling gd &quot;the impossible game&quot; 

pewdiepie: the impossible gamegd players: i want him DEAD!

The geometry dash community is looking at you, and they&#39;re not happy.

<a href="">7:08</a> WAIT WHAT THERE&#39;S NO WAY THAT WAS THERE ORIGINALLY WHATMandella effect or something happening because I swear I don&#39;t remember this song being in the video.

Just hearing the kid hyperventilating hurt my vocal cords

Npesta Let&#39;s gooooo
Pewdipie hurt the entire Geometry Dash community by calling it the impossible game.

its called geometry dash and it took him 8 months

When gamer has game but no gfuel

Speedrunner 
Anyone else here impossible game speedrunners? I am lol.

BRO I LOVE THE PENIS MUSIC!!!!!

It&#39;s not Impossible Game, it&#39;s Block Jump. BDSM community is very disappointed.

<a href="">1:27</a> its not the impossible game thats ragist

Npesta literally beat a top 20 demon and yall make him a meme

Pewds dosen’t know what npesta went through to verify kenos

Hi

the entire comments r about pewdiepie being stupid

Uh… I mean… as a cancer, I feel very annoyed when you guys keep telling me I’m supposed to cry.That was supposed to be a meme about something but idk, I guess to you it might just sound like one of those dumb liberal memeeeeeesssssssss

I mean, in your defense.As someone who has always had long hair.Boy, have I always wanted to cut it.And uh… been afraid when it gets cut…

ᵖᵉⁿᶦˢ ᵐᵘˢᶦᶜ
OMG the random chimp event is happeneing right now

why does pewds think the confederate flag is the republican flag LMAO

Tf2 player lazar purple did pp music with bagpipes and engi screaming

I miss meme review 
The random chimp event it&#39;s here

PewDiePie should try &quot;The Impossible Game&quot;. ;D

you didnt really get the amount of effort

Pewdiepie : he&#39;s speedrunning a square game called the impossible gameThe entire GD community : <b>WHAT IN THE WORLD DID YOU JUST SAY ????</b>Pewdiepie : respect to npestaGD Community : <b>that is better</b>

Early March 2020: virus thing already happened. that did not age well

petition to bring back that hair cut?

the video would’ve been better if my ears didn’t spontaneously ignite causing 3rd degree burns

Give me your head pewds.How dare you call Geometry Dash the &quot;Impossible Game&quot;.

we got gd bees noesta less goooo
First comment in s year since last comment wow and while I&#39;m here I thought about this, who the phk started that music, like how did it grow like that ???

<a href="">3:26</a>Me literally getting a 3 week long compilation of pewds screaming at a video game

i dont like that pewdiepie covered npesta in a way that made him seem like a complete idiot. the achievement was abolsutely huge, and i dont think everyone realizes how close levels as hard as kenos are to the human limit. the sheer difficulty of these levels surpasses any other, making beating them the accomplishment of a lifetime. nathan seriously spends like 300 hours on kenos and then just gets memed the shit out of and called a nerd/loser. i think that says something.

&quot;worlds hardest game&quot;

<a href="">5:19</a>

It took npesta 8 months to do that

I feel bad for Npesta, he spent 8 months, 135,320 attempts, 300 hours to verify that level all for people to make fun of him for having a hilarious reaction.

&quot;speedrunner&quot;
idk why but i always like pewds with bald hair and long baered something abt it gives me kratos vibes

<a href="">7:11</a> Giving me undertale vibes 
Pewds can pass any haircut.

Jsjs pewdiepie reacted to nepesta and I didn't even realize it XD
How has it almost been 2 years since this video

<a href="">12:47</a>

Dang, we really do be livin in a society

I love pewds, but this comment section is one of the worst ive seen lmao. So many redditors thinking that making fun of a guy for accomplishing something makes them superior

Regular music

Npesta took 4 years to verify and its one of the hardest level is the game of hystory

Speedrunning?

I’ve come back to tell you the random chimp event had happened, the ape nfts are here

pewds warned us the random chimp event, the nft&#39;s there every where

trol

<a href="">10:40</a> 2020  coughing...... o no pewds predicted it all along

I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already been a year

“Is that republican?” <b>confederate flag</b>

Although Npesta’s reaction was a bit extreme and abnormal, it’s still an incredibly impressive feat. It took him months to verify it and he was going through a lot.

Welcome back to pewdiepie infuriates the geometry dash community

geometry dash is now renamed square game

GD what are they all top?
BRUUUUUH, pewds called gd speerunning game he has no idea what Npesta got threw and his reaction was understandable, i bet if pewds tried gd he was going to shit his pants XD

npesta :)

AHAHAHAH

square game

When you finally finished your essay be like: <a href="">1:44</a>

When I saw npesta meme<b>searches pewdiepie reaction</b> :)

npesta isn&#39;t a speedrunner.

&quot;He&#39;s speedrunning the impossible game&quot;

the worst part is that he called gd the impossible game but he’s played it before

Npesta actually made it in lol

Respect 
This makes me rage

PEWDIEPIE BRING BACK THIS HAIRCUT 

<a href="">3:37</a> some one actually broke this record lol

Went back after a year just to hear penis music

Bernie Sanders is listening to PP Music.

Penis music is better than everything

pENIA

My ears melted im not worthy 

pewdiepie calling the confederate flag republican...

Pewdiepie doesn&#39;t know the pain of verifying a demon level

I got haircut 2
this ain&#39;t a speedrun

Geometry dash is not SPEEDRAAAN

PewDiePie you think this is one is funny you should hear the demos one

its funny how he called the confederate flag a republican flag even thought the confederate army was made by a bunch of democrats

If I ever go to a party and someone plays music on the tv I&#39;ma play scrotum music

The random chimp event is among us.

Ik I seem weird and this was a while ago but I found your areaction the the geometry dash npesta meme but I don’t blame you for not understanding he accomplishment but you have to understand that geometry dash is like Osu where it’s rhythm and reflex based but I think you should’ve shown more respect his insane accomplishment. But this is my view on it and I’m not like a twitter weirdo



the npesta reaction is bc it took 2 years for him to beat that lvl

pp music
Aghhhh

Hair
Damn we have the whole GD community in the comment section

Pewdiepie : &quot;Impossible game&quot;Me : You hurt me saying the title wrong even you played it..Later me : OMG!&gt;!&gt;!&gt;&gt;!&gt;!

I bet that over half of the views on this video are from the gd community alone

8 months of dedication for this, title of our leader, gone

Lol the dude sounds like a rubber chicken

I&#39;m listening penis music at 2:30AM and I think I&#39;m going insane someone help

Message from the future: it grew back

N A T H A N   P E S T A

PewDiePie played gd long time ago also pewds the impossible game

I can handle pp musicDumbass

That guy sounds like Pewdipie

it&#39;s just an average reaction to beating the orphan of kos for the first time. a little tame, even.

Somebody tell Felix what flag that is 

Hmm, how to speedrun geometry dash

i messed up gotta go bald

Hair bruh
<a href="">11:06</a> is equal to 666 seconds. Fun fact

It’s Ragnar lothbrok
I am to broke to but G fuel even when I enter the code :(

That’s not the impossible game that’s geometry dash

But pewdiepie played geometry dash on his channel a few years ago.

:(

Nepestas reaction was certified cuz he spent 8months on the level.

that&#39;s the confederate flag... well ur YouTube career is over

Pewdiepie:says he doesn’t like lady Gaga musicComputer:bro u do no u have a mirror that reflects your moniter

I know this is old, but pewds was part of the problem of this. This kid put 8 months in to playing this level and won right before the awards were being given out. So in my eyes this is not an over reaction.

Poggers for God

&quot;hes uh speedrunning this uh square game&quot;

When did we get Slim Shady on?
Pewds: is that the republican flag? Me: well no but actually yes

Does the pewdiepie flavor taste like pewdiepie? I&#39;m guessing so.

You&#39;re right, that is the Republican flag

<a href="">12:23</a> <i>the virus thing that i can&#39;t mention the name of...</i>Why?I really don&#39;t need to hear about it, especially when i look here on yt, but why can&#39;t you mention it? What youtube or gogol have against it? Censorship or demonetization because of bs? Wtf...I know you will not answer, but maybe other people in the comments will say why this censorship... ;-(Cheers!

He kinda looks like Jack Manifold
Too sad felix can&#39;t take the time to see that Npesta actually had some real issues because of that, including harassment within the GD community. Not to mention some self esteem problems aswell, they dedicate so much of their time for a much smaller platform but become a meme instead.... They laugh at his work and get 100x the views.

Geometry dash is BASED on the impossible game. They’re not the same

Npesta&#39;s achievement unlocked: Gamer meme
Why is this recommended

<a href="">1:49</a> So, this is the original.

Pewds. U cant speedrun very much in Geometry Dash. This dude spent 135k attempts and 300 hours in the level. Like i think 6 months. Of course he had this reaction. That level is The 4th hardest level.

little did we know, he got a headstart on haircuts just before quarantine.

Will pewds ever realize that he laughed at the confederate flag? 

<a href="">7:04</a> I mean, that flag might as well be the republican flag

Atleast npesta have honest reaction.

I love the Meme Review intro.

Npesta&#39;s playing Geometry Dash, and the reason why he had this reaction was because he was trying to verify the hardest level in the game, and he spent 8 months on it. No hate BTW. Just letting you know.

That was a year agoo??????

Plot twist: npesta is a pro GD gamer and reacts loudly on the stereo madness practice mode when completed

Im just good with creating in Geometry dash

Speedrunning and Impossible Game .-. Lol

Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year since Felix shaved his headHe looked very epic

True. But doro means I love. And the shape is a triangle. Kinda openly admitting Illuminatis child raping ways.

“Don’t say ‘PewDiePie didn’t warn me that my ears melted because of PP music’.”

I want to see jack have a screaming match with npesta

Npesta Scream makes me laugh

PLEASE JUST PLAY ZZTHE GAME

<a href="">1:32</a> , what you came here for

That took him 8 months to do :)

Can people respect Npesta for his dedication to that level and GD in general. My reaction to Beating Toe2 Was so similar due to my progress being wiped when i got an 86% run and after 6 months i beat it and rebeat Clubstep too. 8 months, 135k attempts, Many Fails along the way. Now all he gets is hate and bullying cuz of this video. If ur not gonna respect him for the original video and not the memes dont give him the negative attention. Cuz frankly he doesnt want it and neither do any other GD players in the community.

It’s Kenos, the fourth hardest level in the game as of January 18th, 2021 and Geometry Dash isn’t a speed run. He spent 108 streams I believe beating it so it’s a reasonable reaction.

<a href="">6:58</a>That’s the Confederate flag

<a href="">0:05</a> XXXTENTACION

The thing I&#39;m wondering is that Marshmello isn&#39;t Verified but the real deal.

I died inside a little when he called it the impossible game

He actually looks so good with this hair cut tho

Im kinda infuriated he called practice mode, &quot;practice round&quot;

PP MUSIC

Npesta took 8 months, and over 100k attempts. PewDiePie does not understand how good it felt to finally verify the 4th hardest demon in the entire game. I would have had an even bigger reaction to beating it than Npesta did tbh

People dont understand the pressure and difficulty of this game. GuitarHeroStyles had a heart attack after playing Astral Divinity. These levels can take months to years and hundreds of thousands of attempts but the payoff in nepstas case was worth it, hes made thousands off of it and got huge recognition and growth. The cons, fucking degenerates made fun of it causing his insecurities and depression. Imagine spending months on something and getting shit on for accomplishing it

Pewds play geometry dash please play it

<a href="">1:33</a> I understand his reaction that game is hard and not the impossible game is geometry dash

Geometry Dash is very Hard, Try it.

Pewds did a video on geometry dash about 6 years ago... so he should remember the game I guess?

He should do a series called &quot;after they became memes&quot; and host npesta

Pewds: hates death grips fansAlso pewds: has the flatlander hair cut

Geometry dash is much, MUCH Harder than it looks, that’s why Npesta was literally screaming.

he really made fun of npesta for being a speedrunner when in reality he isnt

Npesta: &quot;The impossible game speedruner&quot;

Never knew i could drink pewdiepie<b>Pewdiepie Flavor</b>

Wait wait wait. PP island is in Ireland??? Lets gooooo, imms go there at level 2 lockdown

Both.

I&#39;m unsubbing because you  attacked npesta and called him degenerate, it took 135320 attemts to finish it and it took him 8 months

Its geometry dash not impossible game

Seem geome try  dash  pc
Wait i lived bear castlebar and didn&#39;t even know about cock island!!!

Pewds: one day I&#39;ll play pp music in the radio Next week: the meme is deadNext month : the meme is forgottenNext 8 months: the meme does not exist

I like how Felix says his opinions out loud, then regrets it and says those are not his opinions.It&#39;s okay Felix, that was degenerate behavior.

Omg is eminemThe rap god

Penis music
pewdiepies reaction to this actually made me really angry and i now understand why npesta feels so sad about becoming a meme

&quot;Its the impossible game&quot; Why must you hurt me in this way

Petition for pewds to play GD

At least he shouted npesta and basically the whole Gd community was shocked when this happened lol

Felix: Observes that Kenos is a fast paced levelAlso Felix: &quot;He&#39;s speedrunning this square game&quot;

Imagine spending a year to finish kenos (130k attemps) ti get bullied by Piewdiepie

Gfuel= random chimp event liquid
It took npesta almost a year to beat one of the most difficult level in the game, he got rewarded by becoming a meme

No, Pewds that’s the racist flag.

Pewdiepie killed me with his words about that kenos reaction.

taht game is Geometry dash and taht is a so hard level

This has just stopped gd from going extinct

I prefer penis music
It&#39;s a fact that Tuber Stimulator was absolutely 100% easier than Kenos.Kiddo spent months to beat the thing man.

Drake when did you become white!?!

Npesta made a vid on this today, hope you guys understand what he&#39;s going through

Hey pewds, just wanted you to know that Npesta uploaded a vídeo giving some insight into what happened to him. Would  apreciate it if you gave it some sort of exposure, as it talks about what he has been through.

Damn 555 thousand are ready for random chimp event

The whole geometry dash community:𝐖𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝗼𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝Little does pewds know, this is 4th on the demon list which is an immensely difficult level damn

This isn&#39;t funny anymore

Damn, y&#39;all be joking but npesta had a serious self-esteem problem after he became a meme.

Man confused confederate flag with republican flag

<a href="">4:03</a>-And you would be disappointed?! I would be glad someone recognised my existance for the first time

Never gonna give you up

First of all he took 8 months to beat it.Secondly it took him 135,000 attempts

pp music hits hard

huge pp
npesta the first one, actually has now depression and anxiety from the bullying of the reaction. He was just so genuinely happy to beat the level but ended up as a meme looking like an idiot

Did you know penis music is from megamindSo technically........ITS BIG BRAIN

Npesta: Speedrunner of The Imposible Game XDWTF Pewdiepie

Dg for life

npesta the first one, actually has now depression and anxiety from the bullying of the reaction. He was just so genuinely happy to beat the level but ended up as a meme looking like an idiot

I don&#39;t know if im somehow diffrent but I really don&#39;t like the pp music meme. It&#39;s so bad I don&#39;t even know whats funny about it.

When Pewdiepie didn&#39;t know what Geometry Dash was my hear just shattered

LOOOOOL I CANT BELIVE NPESTA CAME ON PEWDS LMAOOO

Ok to be clear the &quot;square speedrun game&quot; is called geometry dash the guy who made the reaction is named npesta and actually spent 8 months on this level and is one of the hardest levels in the game his glasses broke mid stream and spent a HUGE number of attempts so this is not an overreaction

Okay for some clueless people who follow Pewdiepie’s words like the gospel:-it’s geometry dash, not impossible game-geometry dash is not a speed run game-npsesta is a streamer, go watch him-that level took him 8 months to do.

He called the confederate flag republican. CONFEDERATE FLAG

after reading npesta&#39;s pastebin about how it being a meme was severely negativly affecting his mental health for months, this video just sucks to see

Why is 11 hosting we want PewDiePie

watching this video again showed me that Felix&#39;s hair is actually growing

hello from Nizhyn
<a href="">12:33</a> does this even need description?

At <a href="">1:21</a> when it showed npesta playing Kenos on Geometry Dash, he had the reaction because the level took him 8 months, And it is one of hardest levels in the game. In my opinion I think the level should be the second hardest level because Zodiac looks easier and Kenos is very decorated but it should not be 1st since the most hardest level is almost humanly impossible but Felix it took him  8 months to beat the 3rd hardest level in the game and that&#39;s the reason he had a very insane reaction

Wow that dude was acting like he was having the most amazing orgasm while on a boatload of X and Molly 

<a href="">2:35</a> 2020 be like

after reading that pastebin npesta put on twitter this video just doesn&#39;t feel the same

Hi

Penis music
<a href="">10:52</a> when you dont know how to pronounce a word so you just make a sound instead

This is the best hairstyle one can have. We call it the Speed hairstyle as it&#39;s done by Keanu Reeves in the movie Speed. However, Brad Pitt and Gerard Butler also flaunted it in Mr &amp; Mrs Smith and Lara Croft: Cradle of Life respectively. It&#39;s low maintenance and goes with any attire. Despite easy availability of trimmers now, I hardly see anybody with this haircut. Don&#39;t know why.

WELCOME TO GEOMETRY DASH!!!!

Pends sounds like a drug addict but his addiction is gfuel

i&#39;m gonna change my hair color to blueJust a crazy gamer who reacts to Ziyoda&#39;s reaction

<a href="">0:22</a> HE LOOKS LIKE A KAREN

Nice hair
Hes OBSESSED with pp music

It stopped me with penis music 
Might as well be republican flag

Npesta was playing geometry dash. He verified his level so he could upload it and it was considered &quot;extreme demon&quot;. That&#39;s the hardest difficulty in the game and takes like months for really good players to conquer. Basically he just made another one of the hardest levels in the game. It&#39;s not the hardest but it&#39;s up there

roblox hair???? <a href="">0:03</a>
Just cut my hair, I don&#39;t look as good as PewDiePie it&#39;s a scam pewds give hair back pls
