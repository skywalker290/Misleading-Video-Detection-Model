Mystery is kabita mami ne kya gift maangi thi? (Dildo) 

Ultra Pro Legend Are Watching  This  In 2023 

<a href="">5:44</a> 

Love you BB 
Happiness is at the head of the vehicle.
2024 is 2 months away

This year I have written &quot;an obituary has been written for uncle&quot; What did you say to me?
When you noticed sameer said obituary (ch) for the first time

<a href="">4:58</a> tumhari ma kiiii

<a href="">2:14</a> lobe tita mam

Titu mom

Legend&#39;s watch this video 2023

Abe mera nunnu he vo

<a href="">2:18</a> Titu Mama ️ being savage  And brother-in-law...&quot;
Titu Mama called Kabita Mami and told that she would be coming home in 2-3 days. Now imagine what would have happened if Titu Mama went back home first or saw Kabita Mami getting drunk by someone or something.
Also in 2023 
Hey BB Badass Santa Khali can see naughty children, so why is he not able to see the famous guys?
<a href="">00:31</a> Ch kaise bol dia bhai ne 
Why Sameer can&#39;t see Santa because Sameer is harami too like bhuvan and behncho

<a href="">1:40</a> hahaha

SANTA ON 
<a href="">0:31</a> sameer said &quot;chh&quot; not &quot;hh&quot;

Youare a science student

At <a href="">0:30</a> Sameer pronounce &quot;ch&quot;

ye ye to nALLA HAI<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>

Again I&#39;m watching after long time 



I&#39;m searching for the &quot;umra saari&quot;.

one mistakesameer said,&quot;maine uncle ke liye &#39;obituary&#39; likhi hai&quot; Cha pronunciation in obituary by sameer

Sameer has not told his uncle but today I caught his mistake and told him that I have written an obituary for uncle.
Never got bored watching him️
Me watching this video in 2023

It's good that children's nun did not eat.
For the first time he felt the need for a hand and then said that the nevi was looking. Sister-in-law has not seen me for a long time, it seems.
Sameer ne obituary mein ch ko ch hi bola 

Mummy's eyes were filled with tears and you didn't know what was hurt there.


Multiple watches

Vah, Kudahafiz
that be codumaal
Titu mama like button
Daymn

Aur neta banoge ?? Chalak banoge ??

The Nevla was peeping from Sarhi.
The mother's ass was given to me by force. What kind of an ass is it?
Fun fact : Sameer, Titu n BB can go Bangkok in one ticket!

Did someone notice sameer said obituary right  <a href="">0:30</a>

Titu mama and kavita mami both are high level lovers 

Title n thumbnail changed 

<a href="">0:30</a> samir says Obituary &quot;obi&#39;chu&#39;ry instead of obi&#39;hu&#39;ry

<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/2sIfY8vIG8z96ALulYDQDQ"></a>
First time sameer pronounced &#39;ch&#39; <a href="">0:30</a>

Chiiiiii

Chiiiii

How did Sameer say obituary correctly

<a href="">0:30</a> Sameer said obi&#39;ch&#39;uary



Bhai I think that you should get Oscar, what should you get.......Your every video is so interesting that I can't even express it in words, I love you bhaiYou are awesome 
<a href="">0:54</a>

Brother, no matter how much I watch BB videos, I never get bored and always enjoy.
Titu and Kavita titvita

Sameer is my favourite caracter

Imagine a mom in Bangkok hudai de hudai
Ye jingle jingle song ka real version koun sa song hei
Umre saariiii 
I don&#39;t want to look like the one who always goes for mistakes but I just want to let BB know that at <a href="">0:31</a> SAMEER said &quot;ओबिचुअरी&quot; instead of &quot;ओबिहुअरी&quot; the way he is supposed to!By the way I loved the video!

I really love your talent Bhuvan bhai

Video k last ka line 
<a href="">0:31</a> sameer said aubichori instead of aubihauri

Bb holding camera can be seen in Sameer&#39;s Googles 

Titu Mama and Sameer fuddi never fights

Hawa me wo hai...tharak....

Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me that noticed but Sameer said ch instead of h on <a href="">0:31</a>

Well, I just saw Gulu once, I only got this from Santa, brother Gulu has the solution to the problem.
<a href="">0:31</a> if sameer says ha to cha toh itte acche se obituarie kaise bola 

<a href="">2:04</a> - <a href="">2:20</a> Nonstop ......Great BB sir..

I think the mistake in this episode is Sameer gets ignored by Santa I mean there was no scene of him talking with Santa and his wish , it would have been hilarious to see

Santa is seen only by naughty children, so why should he not be seen by Samer Buddi, then why is he seen only by Bhuvan and benches?
