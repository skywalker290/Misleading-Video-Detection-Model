<a href="">8:06</a>try telling me anime is for kids

Goblin slayer messed me up man😅😢😢

Don&#39;t underplay Higurashi. It&#39;s the best horror anime out there with a masterpiece of a  mystery plot. And it gave birth to Umineko When They Cry, the best piece of fiction ever (the VN is, not the anime).

<a href="">10:19</a> bro got vietnam flashbacks

Where can I find <a href="">4:56</a> that is the funniest shit I have ever seen.

I know this video is two years old but man, Goblin Slayer does such a good job of establishing that goblins are pieces of shit that deserve elimination in that first episode.

<a href="">7:08</a> no no no no no no no

I see pokimane I click

Pewds: Imagine getting mad at a video game.Also Pewds: <a href="">10:18</a>

Damn the bongchongdong ghost reaction video! It was the first video i watched from pewds that got me subscribing

Goblin Slayer, berserk, higurashi be like : first time? 👺

Could someone tell me what’s wrong with the berserk part? I still need to watch it and I want some context, especially for that image he showed

Pictures shown: A Bridge Felix: goes near the bridge where the incident occurred and realizes his mistakes.

<a href="">8:44</a> IM REWATCHING THIS AND I DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCE<b>now i do... poor phil</b>

this video made me realize i&#39;m really an &quot;old school bro&quot;, i&#39;ve been watching pewds since corpse party and before.... god, we&#39;re all so old now, and we&#39;re still here, i&#39;m still a bro, and always will be

<a href="">7:05</a> is a really disgusting loli hentai

<a href="">5:08</a> people thought I was watching a Japanese adult video

<a href="">6:49</a> Yo, you&#39;re a chad if you know the one at the top here lol.

I haven&#39;t even read or seen Berserk but I know that horse scene because of it&#39;s legacy of destruction

<a href="">7:06</a> why do i know this

True cultured bros know the yoghurt one

<a href="">6:46</a> i laughed at the full video after being traumatised by it

They should put the sherrif in madness combat about to push the button

Man i love this dude

Pewds: 68 percent of you aren&#39;t subscribed.You know what to do bros, The bros: Let&#39;s make it 69!

Pewdipie noteced Micheal Reeves so proud

lmao the mario/sonic was the best one

the dude with the spiky hair kills himself for people who don&#39;t know also his name is sora

“Getting mad at video is just like why”.  did we forget about the bridge already hmmmmmmmnmmmmmmm

Whats  <a href="">6:45</a>

When the birds cryyyy

The bridge

I’m pretty sure that Mario and sonic clip is the funniest thing that has ever existed.

They should&#39;ve add the Water sheep Incident, where water sheep was about to get squished, by the magma block.

<a href="">8:07</a> … beautiful

Felix: what’s wrong with a yogurt that sounds greatMe:😏

Children on foggy beaches.

God bless..,

<a href="">8:11</a> what a rollercoaster

😴😴😴

The forbidden yogurt

When he said that if you know about corpse party you are a old school bro really made me feel old. Dude it doesn’t feel like that was 7 years ago goddamn :/

im stupid i dont understand the video

<a href="">7:06</a> ohmahgad is that what i think it is

The title got me waiting for the bridge

I dont get the pokemane one

I know this came out awhile ago, but can anyone tell me what pops up behind pewds at <a href="">3:23</a>? Its over his right shoulder.

<a href="">7:04</a> I lost my shit. Glad he didn&#39;t recognize though. If I would have watched this the day of upload, I wouldn&#39;t have known either. I hurt

I feel like pewds is a lot more annoying in this video

I&#39;m having trouble with understanding the berserk horse scene, can someone help me

Guys what was the name of the chicken game that goes bad

<a href="">6:44</a> can someone please tell me what happened in this image. I have been thinking about this for four days now.

<a href="">7:06</a> I feel ashamed that I got that one

<a href="">2:55</a> makes me cry every time I watch the movie.  Also does anyone get the image in the middle of the screen at <a href="">6:38</a>

<a href="">1:53</a> I don’t see-<a href="">1:54</a> <b>*Actually dies*</b>Perfect

Poki in the video for .2 secondsFelix: thumbnail

Omg poggers

Bruh mark epic

well we are back

I don&#39;t understand the Pokimane one

What happened here? <a href="">6:40</a>

After 1 year I finally get the kamina reference

This video preceded a very unfortunate event...

I dont get this video. Do you have to live on internet to get pewds now ?

Can someone explain to me the kids sitting on the ground looking at the field?

What is the video at <a href="">6:41</a>

The screaming girl gave me a fight or flight response

<a href="">2:06</a> this hits different in 2021 😔

<a href="">4:38</a> MR SQUEAKERS NOOOOOO

<a href="">0:45</a> IKR Pewds, Its very immature to get mad at a game and ruin your device because you lost and din&#39;t get what you wanted

Hello

Ah, the good ol days when pewds camera didn&#39;t have the cringy border.☠️

<a href="">8:08</a> So you have never seen Goblin Slayer? Don&#39;t push play, this scene does not end well. presses play.

How can you call yourself a man if you haven&#39;t watched Shoujo Ramune????

<a href="">6:40</a> what is it? Please

I knew like 5 of em

My head is spinning like a screw -:(

R.I.P writer of Berserk

Pewds:Its moments like these that make me proud to make youtube videos.Subtitles:Its moments like these that make me proud to make beauty videos.YouTube😵😵

Where is the bridge in PUBG??

Someone timestamp and post a link to the original videos and I’ll name my firstborn after you

Min <a href="">6:41</a>?? What is it?

Bridge

not me watching this a year later and reminiscing and the nostalgia of all the old horror game playthroughs i watched while growing up

<a href="">2:58</a> This is right before Rika repeatedly stabs her own head

Where is the bridge

&quot;I would never punch something if I got mad&quot; clearly you&#39;ve never been mad enough felix.

<a href="">4:12</a> That soy face makes me wanna bleach my eyes

What is the image at <a href="">6:42</a> in reference to?

Hold up Thafnine runs that account?  I&#39;ve watched him from ages. how did i not know that.

Sooo anyone wants some yogurt?

It would be sadder if it was Kakayoin versus Dio.

Im disappointed to not see &quot;CAN WE COPYSTRIKE PEWDIEPIE?&quot; In this video

The sequence of his reactions is legendary he be like seeing walking dead s1 &quot;awww noooo&quot; then the next picture shows up and then he goes &quot;HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA&quot;

not corpse party awakening repressed memories

damn, a very long time ago he already reviewed this subreddit

What’s at <a href="">6:45</a>

I understood 50% of these images 👌

Damn that horror web-comic brings me back, we used to leave that shit up in Biology Class so that next period would see it and read it.Poor bastards never knew what hit them.

Woohoo, I learned that Felix considers me Oldskool Bro. :D

I have legit PTSD because of <a href="">10:30</a> :( the back of the head alone scared the shit out of me

I&#39;m too old to understand any of these and I&#39;m younger than Felix

<a href="">5:58</a>UHHHHH

<a href="">7:05</a> it is not yogurt, she just got told it was yogurt

What anime is he suggesting at <a href="">1:04</a>? I heear tegentub &#39;gorilla&#39;.

When he started watching the goblin slayer part it made me thankful I instead chose to try and read the manga

Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni  for those that want to know about the &#39;nail ripping out&#39; anime and haven&#39;t watched it, your welcome it is actually very very good

How is the video called with all the kids in the woods

&quot;come on if you haven&#39;t watched TALSNEBEKDIUDBWJWIEU&quot;

Wtf was that naked fairy

Girl gets killed terribly by goblin Pewds:pfffffft

Talking about not getting mad at video games, The bridge shows up

Death notes one makes me sad

For Real though, I&#39;ve had a breakdown like the remote guy...Just not to the point of anal.

goblin slayer the most heart warming  respecting waman shonen ever

The more time I spend on the internet the more I realise the internet is just one big in joke.

<a href="">6:40</a> anyone know that one?

Still don&#39;t get the yogurt one. Probably best I don&#39;t. 😆

I will have to wait when pewds finally finds the truth about the yoghurt

Didn&#39;t get the <a href="">2:07</a>

<a href="">7:04</a> I see you are a man of culture as well.

YouTube best platform ever!!!

dude that face change after watching goblin slayer thats exactly how i felt

i cant tell whether hes seen shoujo ramune or not

For those curious, the one where the squirrel bites the girl is from &#39;Nyan Neko Sugar Girls,&#39; and you can find the whole series on YouTube if you&#39;re interested.

Yoo. With the dissing markiplier 🤔 weird energy bro.

&quot;Old School Bros; sounds good, feels better.&quot;

I love how pewds played off the yogurt pic😂

<a href="">1:57</a> final destination movie i think, quite unpleasant to watch. don&#39;t really remember, have to re watch it.

Y pewds uploads in just 720p

goblin slayer was tramitizing

<a href="">08:13</a> Goblin Slayer had some pretty insane clips..... didnt expect them to be their, but there they were......random as fuck... dope anime though

i think the you want some yogurt is from boku no piku

*pewds*: jajaja clasic*Me*: ptsd instantly kicks in

<a href="">5:14</a> bookmarked

Anyone still here. 5/10/21

I got about 30% of these. 30% seemed familiar.The rest........lhmmmm

I didn&#39;t enjoy this video

I didn&#39;t know any of these

3:21 Am I tripin or does  someone else see that Hand in the background

&quot;I would never punch something when I get mad&quot;How about that tambourine?😄😂

Internet Historian fans: Boys, we finally made it. A mention for 0.07 seconds in pewdiepie&#39;s video

Having a lunch club screenshot as the thumbnail aged well

Bimgus and. Cheese?

<a href="">7:05</a> everyone that know this is a horrible human

i feel left out

I wish outerminds made a “PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist” update, cos I just played it and it’s sick

Leeroy Jengkings

I watched his previous videos and I realized his soul dies a bit more every year and he gets more depressed in the videos

Anyone else got this reccomended in 2021?

You know it&#39;s gonna be great when he starts laughing by just reading the twitter account&#39;s name

Felix really lost face weight. He looks skinnier now. Good for him

Image: Shows just about anythingPewDiePie: Ahhhhh, the classic

Take a shot everytime pewds says the word &quot;classic&quot;

You see yogurt is a keyword for cu-

For pewds is it just a picture of a bridge

nooooooooooclassicnoooooooclassic classicnoooooooooooooooclassic

I was waiting for the bridge😂

I can’t believe this is one year old 😳

Good thing Pewds didn&#39;t watch Shoujo Ramune...

EPIK MA NIGGAA

It&#39;s so easy, noobsThat&#39;s like saying, cmon sisyphus, the rock&#39;s not that heavy! I could put it on the hill in no time!

The fact that pewds didn’t know this reference is genuinely funny <a href="">7:03</a>

<a href="">02:00</a> i don&#39;t get it 😢

Videos that preceded unfortunate events

What is that game called in <a href="">10:28</a>

Ahhhh bong chong ghost now that’s a throwback

What is the <a href="">7:56</a> référence?

<a href="">7:04</a> I know that. 🙂

<a href="">6:39</a>I&#39;m kinda curious about this one but he didn&#39;t say anything to find it:/

I’ve been watching Goblin Slayer recently so coming back to see that goblin and girl one....it hit different

how does he not know goblin slayer...He says: &quot;I hope nothing bad happens to her&quot; and in my mind I get flashbacks...

<a href="">4:58</a>Captions: <b>[Music]</b>Deaf People: 🕺💃

The bridge that the pewdiepie accident happened on has to be here...Edit: <a href="">10:20</a> I knew it...

Whats the pokimayne one?

Uh actually it&#39;s &quot;master Skywalker&quot;.

They should have a picture of just Twitter

<a href="">7:04</a> mhm nothing bad gonna happen after that question

Can anyone give me a link to <a href="">7:52</a>

What is <a href="">2:06</a>?

Jojo isnt good

I’m sofa king confused. I must not be 9 years old anymore.

I can’t believe the break was a year ago...

It should just be a redit

What’s the video at <a href="">6:39</a> ?

What was the one at <a href="">6:43</a> I’m very curious

This is funny, that is funny... Then giggles like the stereotype Swedish cretin.

<a href="">3:11</a> yep it did precede a lot earlier before we expected :/

Caution:If you watch this video , a lot of good movies and animes and video games will get spoiled for you. Please watch with your own risk

Dashcon, dashcon, dashcon,RIP

<a href="">2:55</a> if you know you know

<a href="">3:15</a> pewds played that game a while back and the pic took me so back it&#39;s crazy

He triggered the whole Kingdom Hearts fan base

To the fellow humans who know <a href="">7:05</a> I&#39;ll see you in hell

&quot;Do you want some yogurt?&quot;That line is from a loli hentai...

FYI that girl that got raped by the goblins survivedshe is traumatized now...

I literally didn’t recognize a single one of these images

<a href="">7:20</a> ayyy half life 3 is out rn

<a href="">8:28</a> was regret

What is the yard of kids

<a href="">7:48</a> could not have said it better my self

I never been in a Ball Pit.

Started watching and thought the quality was in 480p

Here is a moment before the disaster PewDiePie crossing a bridge

can someone explain the pokimane one to me? I don&#39;t follow her or know anything about her besides her name

I loved the boo level

the eye clamp one is from final destination (one of them idk) but there&#39;s a laser and it cuts through very slowly

The goblin slayer scene and the look on pewds face 😂😂💀 lol and the old scene were you said bad word

Higurashi and Corpse Party games 🖤

If you know <a href="">7:03</a>You&#39;re going to a special place in hell

yso we got 2 carson screenshots and a philza one in here. i wonder why yt recommended this to me.. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

i saw the thumbnai and immediately said &quot;snieky theef&quot;

*Me seeing shoujo ramune **unholy screeching *

Lol I still watch the anime of corpse party because of you hahahaha

hey the ork and girl video ... i kinda wanna know what happend xddd any links ??

<a href="">3:21</a> whats that behind him?

The yogurt gave me nightmares

This video got recommended to me exactly 1 year later

One year ago

the world is rotten.....I will kill all the criminals and I will become the god of the new world

I watched the goblin slayer scene, and though pretty distasteful, I&#39;ve watched a serbian film. Nothing will ever top (in s bad way) that.

watching this on March 1st 2021

<a href="">8:16</a> you can tell by the noises se has just watched something very distrbing

<a href="">4:38</a> to <a href="">5:25</a> and behond is actually distrbing

<a href="">7:07</a> is hentai😅😅😂😇

Damn that one with the kiddos looking at that hedge. That one hits hard when you first watch it.

NOOOOOOOOOClassic, classicNOOOOOOOOOClassic, classicAHHHHHHHHH

poki

&quot;when they cry&quot;nah. WHEN THE BIRDS CRY.

corpse party was so damn good tho

<a href="">7:05</a> yes, he just asked if you want some yogurt

<a href="">0:00</a> tap this button rapidly to watch ahego press moan.

Yo can someone tell me the kids in the field one. What&#39;s that about and where is the video.

Wheres the one with pewdiepie and the bridge

you should try doing wynncraft, idk why this came to my mind but you should

@<a href="">3:12</a> I&#39;m out of the loop anyone able to explain the minecraft one to me like you would speak to your dad?

&quot;Leeroy Jankings&quot;

Li remember when PEWDS was like &quot;I hate reaction channels&quot; He is one now

Jesus Loves all of you &lt;3

<a href="">08:07</a> what actually is it?? ive never seen it

Felix: I don&#39;t know this one.Me sees Kingdom Hearts: NOOOOOO!!!!!

The ppl aint ready for berserk

How to describe this video in two wordsMeme Nostalgia

Anyone else catch the Danganronpa one before they find Nagito?

The bunny just gets me everytime

When they criePewds: When the birds crie

Whats the video at <a href="">6:40</a>?? Idk

This whole video was uploaded a week before quarantine. Strange coincidence...

BRUH I just realized that pewds read Horang&#39;s Nightmare. One of the most scariest shit I&#39;ve read.

They should have the “I gently opened the door.” Text bubble from Doki-Doki.

The Kingdom Heart pic shouldve just been a title screen...That whole &quot;franchise&quot; the the most shameless cash grab in history.Moshing two of the most popular dynasties togeatgher even though they <b>absolutly nothing</b> to do with eachother for the sole purpose of milking more money out of them by creating cross-over audiences,Sure its a brilliant business idea cuz people are fakking idiots... but its a fakking soulless, shit project from any creative standpoint...&#39; Its morally bankrupt on the same level as EA selling the same friggin game for 60 bucks every year by just putting it in a new box with the current year on the side... and idiots keep buying them... <b>every year.</b>The whole concept is an unfortunate event.

<a href="">5:29</a> walter white and jesse one was also good

Just realized that the &quot;Do you want some yogurt&quot; picture is from Shoujo Ramune.I swear, I haven&#39;t watched it.<b>yet</b>

When you realize where the do you want yogurt is from...

What&#39;s <a href="">4:05</a>?

Finished reading berserk and that&#39;s the most unfortunate event ever

<a href="">8:42</a> that baby zombie...Although it precedes a fortunate event in Philza&#39;s career

&quot;i would never punch something, if i got mad&quot;<b>pewds tambourine convulses in its grave</b>

<a href="">7:08</a> Im sorry pls forgive me i have watch all of it :(

Youtube Videos that proceed unfortunate events:

damn i forgot all about corpse party, i remember that i really was scared

<a href="">8:07</a> o shit i got my nightmares back. i couldnt watch the whole first episode

<b>She just wants some yogurt</b> WCGW

Being called an OG Bro is my highest achievement

What is the image with Pokimane in it I don’t get it

This entire video is Felix screaming or saying classic.

vinland saga has a scene thatd work for this

PewDiePie : I would never punch something Also PewDiePie : <b>punches tamborine when he loses bottle flip challenge with Sean</b>

Carson should be a pic on this

<a href="">2:43</a> that&#39;s a controversial statement my dude.

I&#39;m happy for Pewdiepie. Like if you agree, champs =)

Miss this guys face

<a href="">3:55</a> CANCEL THIS SWEDIGNORANT

This didn’t age well <a href="">2:04</a>

<b>gasp</b> HE FACE REVEALED?!

This video gets recommended bc I won’t watch the new stuff bc I can’t see his face

I&#39;m surprised there wasn&#39;t a single image of JFK in his car

The good old days😭

The yogurt.... it isn’t yogurt

What&#39;s with the poki pic. Someone please explain

I hate to admit i do know how the girl gets some yogurt

Whenever I need some laughs I just come here. You&#39;re seriously appreciated Felix 😂❤️

Pro tip: If you&#39;re at your boyfriends or girlfriends house and you gotta pee, just play a pewdiepie video in the bathroom. It&#39;ll cover up any pee sounds

Who is this guy? He sounds a lot like PewDiePie

What a very Big Brain Time Title there Pewds?🤔

Gurren lagann is the most anime anime out there

Not knowing what most of these are all i see is Felix looking at an innocuous picture and going &quot;haha, this is funny&quot; before moving on and repeating the same thing many times...

I think I&#39;m going to hell because I know where do you want some yougurt is from...

I think pews is fat now...he not fat? profile pic fat pewds no fat? i am confuse

What&#39;s the <a href="">6:39</a> guys?

Can anyone link with the children staring into the forest unfortunate event? I remember watching it ages and ages ago but can&#39;t remember where I saw it

the shoujo ramune hentai itself is unfortunate that someone made it

Pewds will never understand about the yogurt

<b>Do you want some yogurt?</b> Me : AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Some say gamers don’t cry

Damn this video really made me realize how long I’ve been subscribed to pewdiepie and how old I’ve gotten 😅

<a href="">7:04</a> Pewds: what&#39;s wrong with this??? There&#39;s nothing badThose that knows what next: uhhh...

I remember watching that chicken game on this channel like 5 or so years ago. That ending man lol

<a href="">10:28</a>i PANICKEDlmao i remember you playing that so clearly pewds

Internet historian

<a href="">8:07</a> : Images That Precede Unfortunate Events...

Goblin slayer first episode will always haunt me forever

THE YOGURT ONE WAS FROM A LOLI HENTAI

<a href="">6:41</a> anyone know this image could tell me I&#39;m not interested

<a href="">8:35</a> Me realizing pewds lives jn the UK and kids talk like that there all the time:

<a href="">7:03</a> lmao isn&#39;t this the one with the guy that mouth was randomly stuffed with yogurt

<a href="">7:36</a> HARAMBE SAMA

Why dont you get youtube creators to buy a new youtube, transfer over to that and leave YouTube behind.

Pewds was a LOT calmer then I was seeing the Goblin Slayer scene. I shut the website down, said &quot;fuck that&quot; and I haven&#39;t watched a second more since.

Why wait for it, when you can do IT YOURSELF 🙃

<a href="">7:04</a> he doesn’t know

<a href="">6:39</a>can anyone tell me what film that is?

I think every uk person  has one response to <a href="">6:40</a> Dear god

PEWDS NEEDS TO WATCH GOBLIN SLAYER

What happens in that anime clip?

someone tell me wtf that orc and girl photo is from, Felix&#39;s reactions are too good for it to remain a mystery. I EVEN DID REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH lol and the twitter account doesn&#39;t have it up anymore! Was it that bad?! I must know.

can someone tell me what this image is at <a href="">8:10</a> ? Can someone send link?

i just realized pokimaine is the thumbnail, who wouldve thought

images that precade to legendary eventsidubbbz: SAYYYY

Not Sonic ‘06😂😭

<a href="">6:49</a> LMAOO THERES A DANGANRONPA PIC THERE

<a href="">8:53</a> pweds says blet not knowing what it meansRussians and lithuanians 😳

What was the pokimane one?

Like for pewds to do a kingdom hearts play through

Carson and pewdiepie should do a meme review together

Wait. If you have so much money that you&#39;ve basically retired already at 30. Why does it bother you so much to lose rev on ONE video?

the philza minecraft one still hits different

the &quot;do you want some yogurt &quot; image, is illegal(hint) it&#39;s from a loli hentai with VERY young children and a 50-60 yr old man

“I would never punch something if I get mad”Tambourine😐

Guy: <b>Freaks out</b>The remote: Adios

fun facttype in guy in the search bar and then first thing you get is guy shoves tv remote

Idk the little kids one

What the...

<a href="">3:55</a> felix doesn&#39;t know kingdom hearts... im gonna cry

I was waiting for the bridge

<a href="">6:39</a> can someone please tell me what video this is from

Pewdiepie what is this (Goblin Slayer ptsd insues)

T Series ad on pewds vid?! Wtf

Pewds: I would never punch anything when m angryTambourine smash!!!!

That danganronpa image hurts

“That was so scary” haha i love that

This is one of the most cursed videos of Pewdiepie EVER

Pewsdipies face before sdeeing what happens in Goblin slayer is an image that precedes an unfortunate event

There was also a Leroy jankins reference in a episode of MacGyver not too long ago

You want some yogurt is the most horrifying one

He was offering a different type of yogurt

Corpse party hit me deep in the pewds nostalgia. Cannot believe how long I’ve been watching this guy lol

so we just gonna ignore the panty and stocking pic in the end? 🤭🤭

I love pewds

Where do I find this <a href="">6:29</a>

What happened to the kids looking at the picnic tables?!?

Iam sorry ive been living inside a cave. What was that clip about pokimane?

JÖRGEN

Anime is gay like if u agree

Literally any image from an anime of a teenage girl and a small boy.

<a href="">5:00</a> they predicted Alinity and her cat

<a href="">8:21</a> imagine marzia walks in at this moment of all moments.

Images that precede to unfortunate events: <b>dark souls menu screen</b>

&quot;I would never punch something when I get mad&quot;Tambourine: u sure &#39;bout dat

<a href="">4:53</a> alinity cat gets revenge 2020 Recolorised

<a href="">8:21</a> our reactions literally

<a href="">7:10</a> to anyone who knows this anime see you in hell mate.

I still don&#39;t like how pewds pronounce the anime name like so fast that&#39;s why I get to watch it LOL

<a href="">6:48</a> the top one tho

I’ll never forget how intense the corpse party series was

JENKINS not jenkings

<a href="">7:06</a> Why do i hear police sirens?

Classic

Pewds collabed with KSI in 2020 btw

Love that this is recommended to me every few months without fail

That doll on your background... i find it highly disturbing

<a href="">6:39</a> what is the original??

Pewdiepie unironically making fun of &quot;soy culture&quot; kinda makes a complete dickhead

<a href="">7:08</a> its fuckin cp man wtf how is even legal i mean srsly

<a href="">7:03</a> you innocent boy

<a href="">1:53</a> Damn the best series ever

<a href="">8:16</a> Poor Sive

<a href="">8:35</a>We know that top image

<a href="">8:15</a> Pewds: he he<b>2 seconds later</b>Pewds:  :O

<a href="">10:18</a> ignore this timestamp

what anime did he say?

Do you want some yogurt?

that you want some yogurt one got me trembling in my seat, moving into space should throw the fbi off for a litte while

That kingdom hearts one is right before sora stabs himself with the dark key right?Also funniest part about the goblin slayer one is that thats the first episode, and then it maintains a comedic tone for the rest of the series(from what i hear at lest), it doesnt even approach that sort of edge.

I love how I got the psa one immediately.

<a href="">7:04</a> im scared pls help

Aww I remembered the <a href="">10:46</a> watching pewdiepie and watching it with my friends then we all screamed together

His reaction to goblin from goblin slayer reminded me of the old two girls one cup reactions.

The bridge scene in pubg...

<b>insert any pulp fiction scene</b>

this is my favorite pewdiepie video idk why

My fav twitter account as well!

The do you want some yogurt is from a hentai called shouju ramune, where a man rapes Children.

<a href="">6:42</a>, one moment before a car barrel rolls. Pretty awful. It&#39;s an advertisement for speeding.

If you don&#39;t know what happens to the kids at 6 minutes 40 seconds. They all get hit with a car. Have fun getting that image out your head.

At <a href="">8:45</a> the entire Minecraft community said F

the reaction of him watching the goblin slayer clip had me dying XD

<a href="">3:37</a> can someone explain please?

Beware of Poky she is called so for a reason The girl is professional in stealing guys

<a href="">7:05</a> 😒😒

<a href="">6:37</a> COD MW2

Someone should have put a picture of JorgenEdit: NevermindRIPJorgen

<a href="">6:40</a> I knew... And yes, it is amazing. I love how pewds said OMG YES when he saw it. For those who don&#39;t know, the kids get squished by a car.

Wut the goblin slayer vid called

if you dont know about the yogurt you dont know about the yogurt

I didn’t get the pokimaan one

I laughed SO hard at the clip of old pewds getting scared at the game

subcribe to thafnine he runs the account

Felix&#39;s expression before and after finishing Goblin Slayer&#39;s infamous scene is priceless.

on the last one with the food I genuinely felt bad for him

I wish that they showed the image of Felix in the bridge about to say the no no word

Higurashi is fye

<a href="">10:18</a> is what we came fore

When the birds cry, haaaaa yes, best animr

*When the birds Cry Noice

Hey guysI recently posted my first video on my channel. If u don’t mind spending a few minutes checking it out, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks

i wonder what type sense of humor is this?

the second he started watching the goblin slayer clip i knew what was gonna go down, felix if you see this watch goblin slayer its a bit messed up sometimes but its really really good

<a href="">1:54</a> I watched this video to laugh, not get flashbacks.

<a href="">8:46</a>. Did I cry a little. Yes. But that&#39;s okay.

<a href="">6:42</a> can someone explain cus I dont friken understand this

<a href="">7:07</a>. That&#39;s &#39;Shojo Ramune&#39;, and you&#39;ll know what&#39;s the yogurt.

That amazing feeling when you get called an old school bro👊

The intro was an advert? I thought it was some kind of sponsored thing.

I searched for Leeroy Jenkins and apparently there&#39;s a literal army dude writing an article about strategic military perspective on leeroy Jenkins mishaps

The yogurt is a hen hehe

<b>Do you want some yogurt?</b>

Pewdiepie add on a pewdiepie videoWAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTT

I actually thought that his ad for his phone cases that were before this video was just the start of the video lmao

&quot;what is wrong with anime!&quot;, a lot.

The owner of the account can just take print-screens of to be continued memes

Who else doesn&#39;t know wht the fuck is going on

&quot;Images that precede unfortunate events&quot; (Shows image of Pewds on Joergen the First in the nether)

The higurashi when they cry image brought back a summer of nightmares

I would love to collab with you on a cartoon where you do some of the voices and sound effects... PewDiePie cartoon would be amazing

<a href="">9:59</a> “Getting mad at video games is like why”<a href="">10:14</a> “I hated that level. Stupid singing piano!”😂

I gently open the door

It kinda made me mad that pewds skipped racist mario

<a href="">7:06</a>Pewds:Like,how is anything bad from this?Me: <b>Profusely Sweating</b>

Ur reaction to goblin slayer was gold

Lovely thumbnail we got here.

&quot; whats wrong with anime &quot; goblin Slayer is not anime is just pure shit

There needs to be one that says: <b>You could say it was the greatest plan</b>

LoL <a href="">3:43</a>Why wouldnt you have felix even watched the joker????

Some of them hurt so much I needed to turn away from the screen. Mainly the ones that involve suffering of children. My heart literally cannot handle it for some reason.

<a href="">7:03</a> the sauce is shoujo ramune

Some guy eat a 150 year old MRE, so a 50 year old Crystal Pepsi isn&#39;t that bad

<a href="">3:49</a> thanyy you pewds you spoiled me

<a href="">7:04</a> thats from a hēņťäì

Whenever he says something along the lines of “if you’re an og bro, you get it” I tear up a little bit ngl

At <a href="">8:10</a> what is that anime?

<b>&quot;I gently open the door...&quot;</b>

<a href="">6:40</a> Can anyone explain this thx.

<a href="">3:55</a> this is from kingdom hearts. (SPOILERS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!) this is when sora stabs himself to release his heart, the 6 princesses hearts, and kairis heart.

I am surprised by the absence of Nina and Alexander from FMA

Pewds: See&#39;s goblin holding a girlPewds: I&#39;m sure they&#39;re gonna have a good time Goblin slayer: <b>NO</b>

nothing makes me happier than pewds saying im an OG bro for remembering corpse party when ive been here several year before that

Or when kakyoin use emerald spaah on dio

Shojo ramune was there and pewds didnt know.FBI: you aight...

<a href="">7:03</a> I see that pewds has been saved of some degeneracy

Guy: <b>*freaks out*</b>Remote: &quot;Into the unknown&quot;

<a href="">3:20</a> what’s that behind his chair?

Half of the effort on that crying cringe cat girl was just in the tits

&quot;i would never get mad at a videogame&quot; gets mad at fall guys

&quot;precedes unfortunate events&quot; is berserk in a nutshell, even the author got depressed writing it

Bruh you said you were gonna play minecraft this week wth man

for rollebl

Shouldve done one of a white large van parked infront of an important building for the government in norway

I’m so happy that pewds classified me as old school bro

All images precede unfortunate events

<b>hi</b>

<a href="">0:55</a> that quote didnt age well, flash forward when Pewds destroys tamborine becuase he lost bottleflip challenge.

The yogurt one is a Loli hentai

Pewds didn&#39;t watch Jojo back then so he doesn&#39;t know the Billy Mandy epic scene 🤣🤣

The ball pit is from a furry convention. Internet historian made a video on it i recommend ppl to watch, or for pewds to react to it

Pewds face when he knew the truth about goblins in goblin slayer😵🤣

So what happened at <a href="">2:08</a>?

This video would have been funny if we were in Felix&#39;s brain.

&quot;Do you want some yogurt&quot;Me: I have seen to much to know this

i like the vid but, its missing a familiar color...a very tamborine-shaped color...

<a href="">7:03</a> what&#39;s wrong with having yogurt?  ME: ahuehuehuehuehue you woudn&#39;t understand ahuehuehuehuehue

This aged like fine wine 🍷 Pokimane is OUT

&quot;whats wrong with the yogurt&quot; lmao thats a hentai no?

<a href="">8:26</a> EVERYTHING is wrong with anime

<a href="">6:48</a> omg danganronpa 2, the best one out of all of thempewdiepie should play the games

<a href="">7:03</a> little did he know what yogurt he&#39;s talking about

Goblin slayer one was funny

Felix:&quot;WhEn ThE bIrDs CrY&quot;me:&quot;I feel my heart crack&quot;

<a href="">6:39</a> please help a fellow 19 year old out

Piewdiepie: <b>the coolest 30 year old</b>

<a href="">6:22</a> &quot;You could do anything, but you did this.&quot;How is that not a meme template yet goodnessedit: I know he says &quot;and&quot; but half of the subtitle-memes don&#39;t have the right lines anyway so shut up.

the yogurt is my favorite

<a href="">6:48</a> eyyy Danganronpa 2 baybee!

What&#39;s the anime he said at <a href="">1:06</a>?

i laughed so hard at he&#39;s goblin slayer reaction, it was exactly the same as mine XD

The group of kids- I made the mistake of watching crazy ads. I knoe.

People who this scene <a href="">7:05</a> is going to hell with me

Surprised pewdiepie doesn’t know that infamous scene from goblin slayer.Aka, the main reason I’m never watching it cause it does the concept like shit. The manga somehow does it worse by drawing it like full-on fanservice.

Sora comits sepuku

Amazing how he asked for Berserk to be there, but as soon as Goblin Slayer (which is pretty tame in comparison to Berserk) popped up, he went &quot;what&#39;s wrong with anime !?&quot;

how to get more views: put pokimane in your thumbnail

He finally made the Supergirl vid! Hehey!

<a href="">3:22</a> Anyone Saw That Thing Behind Pewds Head

<a href="">0:03</a> Wondering Who Copyrighted that..🤔🤔

you know your career has ended if pewdiepie reacted to you.

<a href="">0:57</a> Shit, I saw that episode last week... Still hurts

What is the name of the anime he is talking about? <a href="">1:02</a>

the danganronpa one bruh

Goblin slayer was lowkey a good ass anime

SSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMPPPPPPP

what was the orc/goblin anime clip

I&#39;m ashamed to say I know what happens in the yoghurt one

Pewds&#39; watch a minute clip of Globlin SlayerLaughShocksPewds: What&#39;s wrong with anime

There should be one of pewds on the bridge...

<a href="">10:28</a> c&#39;mon epic gamers can someone tell me what this is? I wanna know

Orgasm <a href="">0:00</a>

😂

“Chat, I really wonder what it is...”

<a href="">5:23</a>WHEN WILL YOU LEARNWHEN WILL YOU LEARN, THAT YOUR ACTIONS, HAVE CONSEQUENCES

the pubg bridge.

The Yoghurt one... Don&#39;t look it up. I mean it. It&#39;s not even funny it&#39;s just weird and uncomfortable and probably illegal.

The fact that 68% of people that watch his videos ARENT subscribed is mind boggling since he has so many subscribers
