Game&#39;s still here 4 years later

They made a javascript version of this

Happy Wheels song is a banger

GUYS HAPPY WHEELS IS BACK GO PLAY GAME YOU CAN SEE HE IS WEARING

Grah

pewdiepie, tobuscus, dantdm, and markiplier all raised me when my parents refused. always grateful

The saddest thing is that Björn will never experience Happy Wheels

I&#39;ve been a regular viewer since 2011. I was 18 back then. How time flies...

3 years later happy wheels is still here 

My childhood

Someone made a happy wheels song. It&#39;s called all the way.

How nostalgic...

<a href="">6:39</a>

Happy wheels is cancelled soz

Top Video I'm Sorry I Missed It In 2020
Me playing happy wheels today: (Laughs in HTML5)

Holy shit it actually is his old mic, ty yt reccomended

it works with HTML 5 now.

pewdiepie: get shattered into pieces also pewdiepie: i think im dead

How have I missed this one?! The nostalgia is overload.

Ahh the good old days... When pewds was constantly mean to his imaginary son. Looking forward to the future when he can terrorize his actual child. &lt;3

I’ve been here since first happy wheels!! Still makes me laugh 

Been watching PewDiePie since I was 11. I’m 22 now time flies

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Your mike is loud

I didn&#39;t want this video to end...

Imagine if he found out it never got Deleted as the dev managed to convert the game into the new HTML5 program

Imagine if he found out it never got Deleted as the dev managed to convert the game into the new HTML5 program

After the 10 first minutes of the video, I can at least say that I haven&#39;t laughed this much over a PewDiePie video, for almost a decade!Edit: Enjoyed the entire video! Thanks for posting this. So much fun!Also regarding about not editing your happy wheels videos. Well, it wasn&#39;t really necessary xD!

thank the creator of happy wheels for making a new version

one of my favorite videos now , this was hella nostalgic

Bitch lasagne has nothing on this godly video

<a href="">2:35</a> i thought there was a dude just wearing pants laying on his back behind him

Imagine if you were one of the people who thought the end of Happy Wheels was going to be the worst thing to happen in 2020

I remember watching this back when I had a bed time. Now I am an adult and I go to bed when I WANT MOM!

i would watch these videos all the time. such a nostalgia trip.

Does anyone Remember…. YES  we remember 
<a href="">9:40</a> Reminds me of the Vespa bit :D

I&#39;m just getting around to watching this and holy crap the nostalgia: the subtle throwbacks make me smile :)

omg I just realized that this video is posted on my birthday, omg I&#39;m very happy thank you pewds

The nostalgia this video brought it unreal. I actually went back to old happy wheels I watched when I was in middle school and didn’t regret it. May have shed a tear

<a href="">10:02</a> Schmoyoho ALL THE WAYYY!!!
those nostalgic voices, tho&quot;I became a FOUNTAIN because you DisapPOINT me&quot;

<a href="">9:01</a> yes I remember when they came out

Wow, that baby fisted you.... 

Pewdiepie- I wonder if any one made  a happy wheels song Sad jack noises

the nostalgia makes me sad



alexa play despacito
I bought my computer to play happy wheels

Are they getting rid of happy wheels wtf man

You used to love the swinging levels

let&#39;s be honest it&#39;s probably for the best that this game died

Seems like forever since i heard James&#39; scream
Woahhh i miss this

It’s insane to me that I have actually never watched a PewDiePie video throughout this damn near decade I’ve been on YouTube. This won’t be the video I actually watch, I’m just not a fan, but goddamn can I respect the HELL out of this man.

The front flip joke makes me smile

I played happy wheels yesterday lmao

good old dayzz

you lied to me pewds

I stuck with you bro 

i didnt even know there was a possibility for 3 unskippable adds

I´d love to watch the old content

Why does he look like Mr beast in the thumbnail?

I thought he was joking with the mic qualitt at first but he&#39;s actually seriously going to use it for the whole video lol.

i donno if anyone realizes but he satys &quot;frontflip backflip, bu dad that was a backfli- shut up&quot; does anyone remeber that?

OMG Guys i played happy wheels it isn&#39;t closed

pewdiepie is the best youtuber not jacksepticeye

<a href="">11:03</a> destroyed in seconds

<b>Hape wels</b>

<a href="">5:01</a> <b>tis but a flesh-wound</b>

I&#39;ve never laughed so hard in my life

<a href="">2:28</a> Felix chuckled so much he started speaking Swedish

Is this where all the ricktrolling started?

&quot;You can kill my child but you can&#39;t kill my spirit&quot;-- Felix Kjellberg 2020

I discovered pewds when I was in elementary and now Im in college. I was watching this youtube video and I checked the comments and one comment said  that &quot;pewds should do this&quot; and I checked him out and about 9 years later here I am :)

he says game not fun anymore but he can still enjoy some way.

s

<a href="">6:35</a>I couldn&#39;t stop laughing

Best mic quality of any pewdiepie video so far

This nigga woke up the day of this video and went “how about some 2014?”.

<a href="">6:41</a> instant karma
@<a href="">8:57</a> pweds : &quot;front flip&quot;    Also pweds : backflips...

E happy wheels is back

Mom: go play with the neighbours kidThe neighbours kid: <a href="">9:30</a>

Nostalgia hits hard.

<a href="">5:23</a> bro that sus

“Haily says the n word every day? Kill her” that’s ironic

DanTDM is typing...

my eyes are illuminated, is pewdiepie the same face of chandler or it´s my imagination?

Pewdiepie calling trollface cringe because it&#39;s 2020 and now in 2021 it&#39;s actually a thing again LOL

Sweden’s biggest flex is that pew die pie is from Sweden

Damn I miss this :(

This aged well

That first couple of seconds 

<a href="">5:24</a> ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

i liked that
shut up I can spell

no I hav a girlfriend acctuly

Bicycle go brrrrrrrrrr
why is happy wheels ending

<a href="">5:03</a> when a kid says fortnite is better than minecraft

I cannot believe people from 2010 are stuck in a time warp and are making old happy wheels levels in 2020

idk why but from <a href="">11:27</a> to  <a href="">12:17</a> i died of laughter. dont ask

The literate double partially strip because butane morally boast astride a careful onion. rural, wild bankbook

bruh, i played it a few days ago

well the title aged like milk

this is sowholesome

Pewds: Did anyone make a happy wheels song?Jacksepticeye: All the way to f****n victory town...

started watching as a 10/11 yo and now I&#39;m actually a 19 year old :&#39;)

Does anyone notice his voice

He is the clown of the year :)))
pov : you r checking the comments after he said “does anyone even know this?”

HAPPY WHEELS!!

Pewds: &quot;Does anyone remember this?&quot;Me who has been part of the Bro Army all these years: &quot;salutes as Pewds Vet&quot;

I love how he still remembers the Dad/Son improv he used to do! Felt so good.Also, anyone else getting recommended this in 2021?

This video made me laugh so hard my brain found it hilarious

YOO GAMERS ITS STILL UP

<b>Does anyone remember this?</b>

<a href="">5:10</a> eating @$$

this aged poorly

YOU IDIOTS happy wheels is not dying

<a href="">11:07</a> you got that mhh like you that I need...

The lively cover neurally appear because accelerator undeniably look for a used group. cute, organic colombia

Rip Happy Wheels .
I watched every one of these

This is why 2020 was such a bad year. Because happy wheels was canceled

Yes I remember this pewds

He did not speak the original son voice (u know the father , son in a cycle )

Does back flip calls it a front flip * child’s voice “but dad” dad voice “shut up son” pure childhood memories right here ily pewds

<a href="">4:10</a> twist it, pull it

The microphone makes this video 10X times better 

i liked these videos because i liked watching pewds have fun, it wasnt really about happy wheels

6ix9ine million views

i can still download happy wheels

I think the big part of the Hype behind Happy Wheels was because at that time and before that, games required your imagination to fill in a lot of the blanks, and now, games don&#39;t rely as much on your imagination, because you can get outstanding graphics and animations to fill in the blanks.

To be pro, you actually need to be able to land the &quot;bottle flip&quot;

I’m a 2021 future person and happy wheels is not cancelled on mobile

6.9M views, nice.
look at the first 2 numbers of views ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I&#39;ve been subscribed to Pewdipie since he played &quot;The Small Horse&quot; in Amnesia.

This hits differently when they banned flash games

good ole middle school  years, from the horror games and this

<a href="">6:25</a>...control or shit???

It is after December 31st and and they did not shut down even though flash are down for some reason it didn&#39;t

It&#39;s now Decemner 31st 2020. And Happy Wheels is still not dead, it&#39;s on a hold until the HTML5 replacement appears.Clearly you are speaking shit, Pewds.(Nevermind: Happy Wheels&#39;s Javascript version saved the website and the game)

JAVASCRIPT COMES IN CLUTCH

<a href="">8:54</a> but you can actually have 10 furnaces

i played it yesterday

Happy Wheels, I seriously swear, those were THE GOOD TIMES!!!!

Happy Wheels, got damn old and great times

week until the day end of an era

i&#39;m amazed how much subscribers you have

PewDiePiehow dare you say this game bad.

Tobuscus made a Happy Wheels song, it’s called “Get Bloody”

I know this video is so old but the way that felix always makes an italian accent (or just saying italian words) when he is &#39;talking&#39; in spanish will never not be funny to me.

Happy weels didn&#39;t shut down
pewds : &quot;Does anyone even remember this&quot;?Me : &quot;always&quot;

I remember when pewds use to put a brofist in his description

Good videos Rubius Omg
He copies
I was laughing when Santa crushed him

<a href="">12:47</a> lmao nice
I bet Pewds didn’t know that UberHaxorNova voiced the Pogostick Man

Pewds always the best at happy wheels

<a href="">8:55</a> does a backflip bus says he done a front flip 

i never got to watch the full video because i was laughing so hard

I cant bear to watch all this I&#39;m not emotionally ready

why does the sofa behind Pewds look like a guy without a shirt and green pajamas sleeping?

man this brought me back to when my brothers and i would hide in the closet and watch your old happy wheels videos because my parents didnt want us listening to someone curse lol now my parents watch your videos with us lol

Jack: replays happy wheelsFelix: lemme get some that

<a href="">6:38</a>

Gamers

<a href="">10:41</a> it all makes sense now His upper half is pewdiepie and his legs are jacksepticeye’s legs so pewds greenscreens jacks legs 

that mic reminds me of wizardyensid

Floor gang report: happy wheels is still alive and being transferred to java. 19 yr olds rejoice

Pewds does a backflip “FRONTFlIP”Me &gt;:(
PewDiePie:frontflip. Bt he did a backflip

Super late to the party on this video..  but I was there back in 2010-2011 watching you play Happy Wheels. I had lots of health issues and this was about what my head could handle. This made me super nostalgic. Thank you for playing this again Pewds

&quot;Did anyone make a happy wheels song?&quot;Tobuscus: Am I a joke to you?

IT ISNT. look on the total jerkface website

Why don't you put subtitles in Spanish? :c
Pewdiepie is overrated.

I&#39;ve known Felix for about 6 years not personally obviously but I&#39;ve watched all of mark and Sean&#39;s vids and I figured I&#39;d give Felix a try and regret not watching him sooner

<a href="">20:34</a> How PewDiePie lost his legs.

i am og i remember happy wheels pewdiepie

He technically caught the cleaver with his inner lips.

Hi pewdiepie :)
miss ur hair :(
&quot;You can kill my child but you can&#39;t kill my spirit!&quot; - Pewdiepie

I got an irection in the back massage part, is that bad?

Pewdiepie: has any ever made a happy wheels songJackepticeye : am I a joke to you

The nostalgia of just being an elementary student and going home to watch one of his Happy Wheels episode made me so happy... this brings back hella memories

Hey watch it pewds dan is better then you 

Did anyone ever make a happy wheels song? ._.

Yes

If there was any YouTube I would pick the king PewDiePie

Komestie is Italian word not spanish
Man, i am crying of Nostalgic right now

So happy didn&#39;t watch him at that time.... don&#39;t think I would be here now

Wrong

Anyone else looking in 5985?
<a href="">18:46</a> Comedic timing at its finest.

Yea I remember

ngl I got sad when this video ended

Happy Wheels isn&#39;t going to die. They&#39;re making a non-flash version.

When you trying to argue-<a href="">0:02</a>

drunk pewdiepie be like

This has made me age rapidly

Me going to play happy wheels in 2020 this truly is the worst year

Pewdiepie: Happy wheels IS canceled Me: checks If IT really happened News: Happy wheels IS not dying

<a href="">7:20</a> why did he say it like that

Felix is as good at spanish as google translate

Man you about out me becouse I watch  almost all your videos and I&#39;m a blogger

felix this is how we met

He went from satire to actually enjoying it and doing the same voices.

um its actually not gone

Synchronized dance 
adsadsdsdasadsdda
His voice.
It&#39;s not anymore

i saw it&#39;s not gonna be cancelled

Does anyone remember that pogoman is voiced bij uberhaxornova ,the good old times

This is memorable, this brings us memories

pore one out for the dead child hood memories

What would happen if I put an insult in Spanish in an English community? They are all whores
still brought me chuckles

Chairmode activated. Boop.Tears rolling down my eyes 

Greetings from Brest
<a href="">23:56</a>

I remember the good days of being in class on a computer and being bored turning this game on and forgetting my volume was at max

Pewdiepie:we&#39;llgo together Me:*waiting for he was like a father to me*

“It’s loud” JUST WHAT HE SAID IN THE FIRST EPISODE.

<a href="">0:10</a> anyone here who went to video quality.after some seconds:no It&#39;s fine.

Audio: &quot;It&#39;s evolving, just backwards&quot;

Pewdiepie: I&#39;m the best ooo look front flipHe does a backflipMe: Bruh

Why am i crying

All of the new fans dont know this

My mom walked in at <a href="">9:50</a> and I had to frantically explain that I wasn&#39;t watching porn 

&quot;I became a fountain because you disappointed me&quot;

why pewdiepie have the same haircut than me

I remember spending hours creating happy wheels levels and experimenting

I'm from Mexico and this insults me
I met you at 14 after school when searching for conspiracy videos about Talking Angela. I watched your Talking Angela video and I’ve stayed subscribed ever since. I binged all your old stuff (and I mean ALL of it) and all the recent stuff you had out then. Now 7 years later, this made me feel 14 again. I outgrew many youtubers, but you were always among the ones I stayed consistent with. As common and cheesy as this is to say, I wanna thank you for growing with me through the toughest decade of my life. Thank you, Felix 

<a href="">1:57</a> did he just predict the future??????

i liked the part when you weren&#39;t funny for 25 mins straight

I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever stop with Happy Wheels. He keeps coming back every once in a while.I mean it&#39;s 2020!!! The last episode was supposed to be in 2013. Haha!

<a href="">18:44</a> of course it&#39;s nostalgic. You actually played this level on your first video of Happy Wheels. Lol!

But dad??It&#39;s the best thing I have ever heard!!

i remember coming across his channel in 2011 when he played happy wheels all day.

Her: he&#39;s probably thinking about other girlsHim: <a href="">9:36</a>

wow it’s like i’m twelve again

Cool now is audio matches his video quality

He doesn&#39;t have that nerveous swedish accent anymore.

<a href="">15:15</a> the graphics  are so beautiful Minecraft: understandable have a great day

Omg his speaking the language of God&#39;s

Pepperoni ... :&#39;(
AHH HORRIBLE SOUND QUALTY MY EARS HURT

happy wheels hasnt shut down yet

You lier pewdiepie your telling a lie it&#39;s not shuting down there upgrading it to not need the Adobe flash thing

Happy wheels ain&#39;t shutting down what are you on about

Pewdiepie: <b>kill a baby</b>Pewdiepie: I like it

Warning PewDiePie crosses a bridge in this episode xD

why does felix look like chandler in the thumbnail

lol they’re making a JavaScript for happy wheels

I watched every episode of his happy wheels series as they came out so this makes me really happy lol

I remember having to hide my laptop screen in the dinning room from my mother so that I could play this game

Chotiya

does anyone remember the words &quot;THIS SANDWICH DOESNT HAVE TURKEY IN IT! GET IT RIGHT! YOU SON OF A B!TCH&quot;

felix: rate 5 for my legs me: wait.. UR LEGS?!!?

I am 28 and my brother works for Happy wheels so i will ask not to canccell it

Remember lads, subscribe to Pewdiepie

This hit hard.

<a href="">2:28</a> that&#39;s actually some Italian swearing

I was there when you played happy Wheels but then I stopped watching

<a href="">14:06</a> FELIX, 

HYPOCRITE

2020 ppl be like:

Started watching Pewdiepie back in &#39;12 when he originally did Happy Wheels

&quot;Does anyone remember this? Stuck with my channel? &quot;Me still hanging her since I was in the 4th grade now in high school

I remember watching him play happy wheels when I was nine and being scared of my parents walking in cuz he say swores.

Y

One of the most iconic line in Happy Wheels: &quot;ALRIGHT, SON!&quot;

2020 really is the worst year

All the nostalgia omg

I smiled when pewds said frontflip but he did a backflip

I smiled when pewds said frontflip but he did a backflip

Watching him spit random Spanish gibberish made my day
Pure nostalgia right here

can definitely see why he didn&#39;t want to post a happy wheels video this is so boring

<a href="">5:19</a> wow never got a rim job that made me scream

I miss the good old pewds man Stephano man  such better easier times I’m sorry to say I don’t like what’s become of pewdiepie but I’ll never forget all the great stuff he did and the fire watch video man that was impactful

Top 10 proof that 2020 is the end of the world1-Happy Wheels is shutting down in 2020

Just woke up from a coma, glad to see that you’re still making the same content!

Saying front flip instead of backflip just brought back all the og memories

I looked it up and happy wheels is still going to be a thing after flash is gone because the creator of happy wheels is making a Java version.

The nostalgia

&quot;HAPPY WHEELS CLOSED IN 2020, LAST CHANCE PLAY!&quot;posts video on January 2 2020

Imdoent like t servis
I thought this was a new video

ugh....the emotions!

Bad things that are happening in 2020:-Coronavirus-Riots in America-HAPPY WHEELS IS SHUTTING DOWN

I laughed so hard throughout this video, not even trying to butter Pewds up this was just genuinely hilarious

The nostalgia man

DONT CALL ME NOOOOOOB AT HAPPY WHELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I&#39;m a total Psychopath since the more I hear the guy screaming the more i wanted to laugh uncontrollably!!! I needed to pause the video to compose myself!!!

Lol the pic quality

Pewdiepie: has any one ever made a happy wheels songJacksepticeye : am I a joke to you

At 11.55 big PP in the sky

as soon as he said &quot;DAAAAADDDDDDDDD&quot; the tears <b>would not stop flowing</b>i really grew up on this channel damn

A java script version of happy wheels is being made but still sad to see this go away

the world really went downhill since happy wheels was closed

I laughed from a PewDiePie video. Feels like old times.

I still can&#39;t believe Happy Wheels was released 10 years ago

I remember watching you and Markiplier with my friends in school and secretly playing FNAF, Slender, Happy Wheels and other games with my friends on the school computers. I miss those times. people weren&#39;t as serious about everything back then.

The nostalgia in this video is crazy

I love this ️

<a href="">20:06</a>Once you hit spikes, you’ve hit them all

Of course i remember :D
I always liked whenever you’d do a backflip and would say <b>F R O N T F L I P</b>

<b>B A R R E L S</b>

The first level that he played in this video was also the first level that he played in a very old episode. He didn&#39;t even realize it

Yah the BACK story to the human cantipede

Rip old happy wheel Voice

Pewds:” That is what happends to babies!”Me wondering if i am 12 counts...

Of course, we remember this. We remember before you played this even.

<a href="">9:39</a> SIMP

2020?

This is so damn nostalgic, I&#39;m sad to see happy wheels go

This is like that one anime that goes on for 10 seasons and then there&#39;s that one episode that&#39;s just like &quot;Look how far we&#39;ve come&quot;

gg

Brings me back to when I&#39;d go to my friend&#39;s after school and we&#39;d watch happy wheels videos all day

<a href="">4:24</a> I just died of laughter because he screams so stupidly xD

end of an era

Yo watching this wow i cant believe how long it has been since i last watch him play happy wheels i was like 12 now im 20 and this is just such a treat for the the inner kid inside me

Happy views

<a href="">8:54</a> pweds said &quot;front Flip&quot; but he Actually did a back Flip

Amnesia days were the best days... change mi mind

“Dayhd, why is he playing us again? He has more games to play—““I DON’T CARE YOU LITTLE SHIT, THIS IS EPIC, now shut up and fly off the bike. DOUBLE BACKFLIP!!!”“Dayhd, that. Frontfli—““I DON’T CAAAAAAAA—“

Dude this video just shows that Pewdiepie really hasn’t changed. He’s still there. He’s just more mature, and doesn’t play games anymore

When you see a blonde British man with vampire powers <a href="">5:02</a>

Then I'm not Swedish if I don't ride a bike like my father
Pewdiepie I Challenge You
<a href="">4:50</a> this looks wrong...

Omg you’re not an OG happy wheels if you didn’t complete the pokemon course with every single character 

I started with happy wheels been subscribed ever since and now I need more.

These were the first videos I watched

pewdiepie&#39;s I DON&#39;T CAAARRREEE,brings so much flashbacks in my head...

<a href="">8:54</a> does a backflip and calls it a frontflip

is pewdiepie stuck with 103 subs!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!

Been watching since happy wheels, picked you over tobuscus cause you swore and I found that hilarious

I hope he brings his legend intro and outro as well,, but what can i do. This is enough to make me smile, watching pewds playing this game again, after a long time.

Of course we remember all the reference you made. Also you used to call the son Timmy! Was waiting for that xD This brings back so much nostalgia and memories and I&#39;m glad I stuck with you throughout all your phases. (Even tho I&#39;m lagging behind on videos but I&#39;m catching up lol)

We’re together now, we’re on this journey together - 9 year old army

...I&#39;m gonna miss Happy Wheels, I feel like I&#39;m 12 again, Felix...Edit: Pewds, happy wheels isn&#39;t dying &lt;3

&quot;Hailey says the n-word? Kill her!&quot;Uhhhh... Pewds?

I still play it
I am truly in 2013

Strawberry jam <a href="">11:50</a>

This hit me with so much nostalgia. I remember the first time my older brother showed me this. I came home every day from schooling watched the latest episode of Happy Wheels or Amnesia or whatever he was playing at that time. Freakin cried literally the entire episode.

MY PAPPY

2091 Happy Wheels #77: One last time2092 Happy Wheels #77: Again one last time

Happy wheels is still alive-2020

It&#39;s still on mobile

Felix: <b>has anybody made a happy wheels song</b>Jack: <b>YOU ARE NOT A GAMER</b>

And funny

That was fucking awesome

It&#39;s on Android and iPhone and tablets and ipads

So much nostalgia when i used to be 5 

No brofist again:(

aah old days!
<a href="">0:03</a> when you about to say something but your mind is not responding

Boobs ha 
This whole episode was a throwback and I loved every dang second of it! As an old Bro, this had me rolling in laughter.

Anybody get nostalgia hearing uberhaxornovas voice
This is literally what got me watching pewdiepie!

Pewdiepie leaves kid behind...What will he do in real life : - )

I was six when I watched your first happy wheels vid, now I’m twenty.......................worth it

Jack made a Happy wheels song

I still remember felix yelling &quot; I DON&#39;T CAREEEEE!&quot; the good ol happy wheels days. Now its going to be gone.

Felix: Does anyone remember this?Snape: ALWAYS

Genuinely emotional! Just the memories of watching Pewds back in the day and Happy Wheels marathons 

<a href="">6:21</a> attack on titan song XD

Damn it&#39;s been a long time

PewDiePie should make a video where he reviews Sweden candy and he uses pp points to right then

Mortal combat Happy whell Mortal happyAnd lol why ricardo milos is in happy wheels

NOOOOOO BUT I LOVE HAPPY WHEELS also I remember when happy wheels was like the thing

Me : Finally i grew up!Me : <b>sees this vid</b>Me : <b>.. I&#39;m 10 yrs old again</b>

Felix:brutally squashes someone Also Felix:oops

&quot;Does anyone even remember this?&quot;I&#39;m offended

Please please please continue to do Happy Wheels videos!!!

You even got your accent back
This is VERY important for everyone to know. Jim Bonacci stated that Happy Wheel will NOT be cancelled. A Javascript version of the game is being worked on, &amp; we can all still play even after the day Adobe cowardly gives up on everyone. HAPPY WHEELS WILL LIVE ON!!!

CARRY MINATI jindaaa baad

Holy hell this brings me back when I was 13 years old and watching pewdiepie play happy wheels, that was the best shit ever

<a href="">2:07</a> don&#39;t mind me, i just need it<a href="">2:27</a>

This vid hit so damn hard

This is so 2012 it hurts.

Pewds: &quot;does anyone even remember this. Has anyone stayed with my channel that long?&quot; The pewdiepie veterans: &quot; yes :( &quot;

dont know why he was that good at harpoon dodge

This is the pewds I missed so much but the real question is who remembers Amnesia.

You know what if old school sounds like that i dont want it anymore

ahhh felix u brought old memories back :)also me: <b>crying to tears</b>

the microphone sound weird

Where is out bread haircut?

Nostalgia
He even did the voices bois 

Do a gameplay of Super Mario Sunshine

Why you bought a errape headset?

<a href="">23:43</a>

STEPHANOOOO MY OLD FRIEENN

&quot;Has anyone ever made a Happy Wheels song?&quot;All The Way: am I a joke to you?

I think your old happy wheel videos are what made me subscribe. It’s sad that it’s shutting down

<a href="">12:47</a> 
Pewds: Hailey says the n word every day? I will kill her!The media: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that.

Here since amnesia days 

Felix: “does anyone even remember this?”The bro army si still there Felix. Stephano will still be in our heart.

This quality is 10/10

In ten years from now he&#39;ll be doing the same exact thing with minecraft which is honestly just really sad knowing that videogames do have lifespans and we never really know if they&#39;re no longer fun until they&#39;re just not anymore

<a href="">0:14</a>Bleat?
Pewds spanish is terrible 

I like Godwin the Goat.

Bro, i miss you u.u
Happy wheels is not shutting down a java version is in the work

I can’t stop 
me watching pewdiepie old videos because he left:also me:𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴
Literally everone in the comments using this format:  &quot;does anyone even remember this&quot;                &quot;Of course we do Felix!&quot;Me seeing this format that is in every single comment section:       .    .            Again?                   <i>_____</i>

<a href="">9:00</a> <b>Yes.</b>

<a href="">22:32</a> is the anime betrayal.

Happy Wheels montages got me to start watching Pewds. Haven&#39;t stopped since. I&#39;m happy he did this video before it ended.

<a href="">10:00</a> &quot;Has anyone ever made a Happy Wheels song?&quot;Jacksepticeye crying in the corner

Calm down it’s not shutting down it’s making a java version so it doesn’t disappear for good

&quot;Did anyone ever make a happy weels song?&quot;

Great ^_^.......

Hi !

Bringing the memory

happy New Year:)
everything just flashback when i watch this video

I don't know what I'm doing here but I see someone who speaks English and is fluent in Spanish, surprising :o
Who is Russian like
I strategically left like 12 videos of pewds unwatched so when he left I’d still get regular new videos. I’m sad to announce this is the last one left. I saved happy wheels for the big finale. Now I’m sad and it’s time for pewds to come back

the nostalgia is real

Plot twist: He lied
My child hood

Haven’t laughed so hard in so long 

Death comes to us all

Just download happywheels O/L with level creator

Epic

I miss the old days when pewdiepie still played video games

Happy wheels is now on Android

Slenderman, Amnesia, Happy Wheels... where has the time gone? I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve all come this far.  That&#39;s wild man

<a href="">6:24</a> Pewdiepie said control or shit
the news about happy wheels being cancelled is fake

#<a href="">2:21</a> the best part  hahaha#<a href="">4:17</a> i cant stop laughing ..this Pogo part killed me

My level of Spanish
LOVED Slender. First PC game that I actually downloaded.

Frontflip!

Peweiepie Is a better youtuber

Thats so funny

I remember coming back from school to watch Pewds play Happy Wheels and now I&#39;m coming back from work to watch him play this.. time flies by so fast.

a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one

the final level made me cry with laughter

1 month later: Pewdiepie is canceled

The final episode of happy wheels... Damn

🇹🇷🇹🇷 you are Turkish, be proud, those who are Turkish, come here 1+
Turkish people come here
They dont suck life ig

Lol I remember watching these 8 years ago

The shitty microphone took me back to when I was ten.

Why did I not watch his vids back then?

I understood everything
This makes me feel things, being a grown man, watching you play Amnesia mods and this crap coming home from work, how times have changed.

This is so sadAlexa play despacito

“Does anyone even remember this?” We have stayed the whole time, so yes we remember.

SpanishBrowfist
You, jacksepticeye, and all of the other youtubers I watch and am subbed too have inspired me to make a YouTube channel thank you

You’ve played most of the maps that Sean played

How could we forget this pewds!!!??? Awe I miss the good old days

Do I remeber? I&#39;ve been here since penumbra 

Come back

He hated all the levels he used to love and loved all the levels he used to hate

The word frontflip still brings back memories to this day.

Give me your original content boi

There is no subtitle &quot;-&quot;
<a href="">10:01</a> im eating
good news: happy wheels is not dying! Probably a few saw it on the website that they made a javascript version of it so it won&#39;t die with adobe flash.

Pew:I want to suk u upUs:that&#39;s what she said

Pew:massage my back leg
Why do I remember like half of these levels lollll

PewDiePie on bed
okay I&#39;m crying

Goodbye bros its been a good decade

<a href="">1:03</a> Logo guy dies of pepe loss

Really missed HW.

Yea but their making another version thats non flash

love/hate relationship with having been watching him since he was playing this... this whole video I was like &quot;this was peak entertainment?!&quot;but also this was highkey funny but it might be nastalgia

hahahahaha pewdiepie doesn't know how to differentiate between Spanish and Italian hahahaha
<a href="">19:59</a> PewDiePie finds bridge. Everybody in a chat holds their breath.

Pewds :Does backflip while saying &quot;frontflip&quot; Me : crying .

Such nostalgia...
I Am Italian and I love when you speak italian

Me i watch you scream your lungs out

This SANDWHICH doesn’t have turkey in it

Russians where
As the creator said, happy wheels is not getting deleted, they&#39;re gonna make a java version of it

Of course I remember that. &quot;But dad, that was a backflip!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t CAAAAARE!&quot;

NOO HAPPY WHEELS NO

this is so fucking wholesome man been here since like 2014 

I&#39;m glad Pewdie made it but I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t miss the low budget playthroughs

Still calling backflips “front flip”

Any body remeber DONT FLAG THE VIDEO
Just why. You dont need it. People that do labour jobs need this not u on your ass whole day making videos whsy tf u think u are

Honestly advertising energy drinks is is like making a burger advertisement for fat 0eople so they get more fat

You need rice and meat not this shite like wtf

Excuse me but wtf is the point of an energy drink pointed at gamers

Nostalgic
I remember waiting everyday for a new Happy Wheels episode. I&#39;ve been a Bro, part of the Bro Army, a Nine Year Old, and a Nineteen Year Old. Man, times flies

Here’s a pun for youHappy new wheels!

<a href="">11:49</a> - FATALITY!!

wholesome nostalgic video until <a href="">22:48</a> and extreme flashbacks occured

this hit me right in the nostalgiaThe amnesia level especially

chairmode activate foreshadowed the $399 chair this whole time

Cool man

pewdipie i learn English from your old gameing videos its so sad when i realise that time can&#39;t be back when i laughing at your hw videos and waching your horor videos all night (2013 &lt;3) ;))

Loved it then, loved it now!

A good old game with the same audio quality back then

This is the first time I heard about this game. At least I saw Pewds play it before it got cancelled

Pewds &quot;does anyone even remember this&quot;<b>Cries is stephalo</b>

Funny how Happy Wheels is going to be cancelled, and Jim has yet to release Divine Intervention 2. GG!

Man this is sad. I remember watching you play this Pewds. Good times. Hate the new YouTube algorithm

You are wrong sir

<a href="">6:38</a> I thought there was someone shirtless lying on his bed in the backgroundLike if u see it

LOL funny Pewds I liked this video yes!!!! :)

Someone has been listening the lonely island lately hahaha

Pewds: &quot;I&#39;m crying on the inside*Me: <b>I&#39;m crying on the outside</b>A new decade begins bros

Yes EVERYTHING is back to the way it was its not like someone left YouTube

Only I am like an idiot because I am not understanding what he says.
Damn, I do realize I joined the channel too late when he makes jokes and I don&#39;t even know who is stefano

The voices bring back so many memories

One question. Why does ur son sound like Carl wheeler?

bruh
sub to lazarbeam

Didn&#39;t he play the same level at <a href="">6:40</a> years ago?

For once he sounds normal and not exaggerating again

This hurts

No u

seeing the happy wheels papers please reminded me of all of the fun times i had playing that game when I was younger. So I bought it again while watching this video.

Can’t wait for the next Fridays with pewds :333 xDDDDD/s

You&#39;ve played the App right?

So many memories!!! I think the first PewDiePie video I watched was Happy Wheels! YouTube was so much simpler back then! Come home from School, watch the lastest PewDiePie and KSI videos then watch the lastest Vine compilation video while &quot;doing&quot; homework! Great Times!

Just like old times. 4 Years ago...

EEEEE

Nope it isnt

You have been misinformed.

Hey guys we should get pewds to playthe new happy wheels Guts and Glory

Hey Guys!!!!! it is not going to be cancelled!!!

BlaD_BochaR TOP!!!
Who is from Vitka? (<a href="">7:37</a>)
Yes, there are Russians here too, you are not alone. Like it so that non-Russians will think that I wrote something funny.
Nostalgia. The happy wheels video days.

<a href="">7:37</a> BlaD_BochaR is russian guy.Vlad Bochar

This was probably where pewdiepie got a very huge chunk of subs, ant believe he forgot lol

Happy wheels is not gone they will make a Java version for it it&#39;s on the website

Damn that nostalgia

<a href="">13:50</a> is it just me or does that smile hit different

&quot;how woman suck your like&quot;Marzia confused noise

I poop thy seek

Ah good times..

felix: <b>speaking italian</b>the level: <b>actually spanish</b>

Hmm it seems everything is shutting down in 2020

Poor Billy, his suffering never ends

Spitalian!!! The superior linguaini!!!

Why does he speak Spanish with a French accent? :v
Happy wheels is gonna get rewritten in JS, so it’s not going to be gone foreverFucking chrome and flash doe

Still here from amnesia times so yes I remember bro ;)

Miss the old videos

<a href="">4:12</a> his face says it all rofl

Join the cult

what&#39;s this game name

This made my day

Fun

We need to start a petition to get the game ported to Steam. I don’t care if they charge full price for it. We’re already loosing flash games I’m not going to loose Happy Wheels too.

Why can’t they just make it as a downloadable game on steam?

<b>Pewdiepie makes back massage noises, as mom walks into room.</b>

When i was four (yes four) i remember watching you play happy wheels with a pokemon levelNow i’m 16 and thanks for all the years of content Felix ️

&quot;does anyone remember this, has anyone stayed with my channel this long?&quot;Been here since 2012 and it feels like yesterday.

I’m getting some high quality Vietnam flashbacks rn..

You can still play it, flash just won&#39;t get updates

Little thought for the creators who surely thought that Pewds would never play to their level. And he did it right before the end ! :)

Started watching in 2012 and I’m actually 19. This hits so hard

Its been so long.. since i actually laugh my ass out watching pewdiepie..

Happy wheel is the reason why I started watching you :D

no happy wheels its not going to die

Felix: Does anyone even remember thisMe: Flashes back to watching the slender man and happy wheels videos when I was 11-14/15. Me, 21 y/o: Still here Felix!

Damn bruh this was nostalgic as fuck I really hope this re invigorates happy wheels cuz a new happy wheels series would be g maybe like once a month tho to not over do it also I&#39;m not crying on the inside I&#39;m crying on the outside

“its just not fun any more” nah mate you are just getting old

Teme:dad YouTube remove over videosDad: I don&#39;t caaaaareeeee EEE you stupid child

Teme: but Dad I love youDad: I don&#39;t caaaaareeeee

This was one of the nicest nostalgia trips I’ve had in a while :)

The nine year old army was not born for this content. The bro army remembers.
