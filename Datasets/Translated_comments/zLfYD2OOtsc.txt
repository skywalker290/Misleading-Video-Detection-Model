What do you have a girl friend 🧐

I love your content 💗 do you have a good night 😴

Rewatching for nostalgia 😢

i played terraria like 5 years ago

Mr Beads chain:

anyone speaking about the fallen bunnies?(1 like= 1 carrot and respect for the fallen rabbits)

😅

<a href="">17:57</a> 🤣🤣🤣
terraria

I was about to comment how annoying this video was, before realizing what channel it is. I&#39;ve heard of it but never seen a video. Confirms why I never looked it up.

g(old)

Pewds comedy. Gold.

You start by exploring your new world. You end with a pig shark seal bird and squidward tentacles from the moon.

Welcome Traveler you are back after all of these years you have returned to this amazing play though

Youtube algorithm recommend me this and i love it😂

Man why is my comment deleted it wasabout N word

Omg it just disappeared

Pewds should bring back gaming weekBut instead of gaming weekGaming strong

Scheelite, was previously named Tungsten by its sweedish discoverers. And indeed thats where the name comes from

Spoilers:There&#39;s still stuff to do after beating the moon lord(final boss) like getting the zenith the most powerful weapon using 10 of the most powerful swords.

<a href="">11:20</a> A zombie and a pogo merged...

Connor is like the water sheep of terraria lol

felix filling up the holes he digs warms my heart

jean pierre polnareff
Gotta love terreria
He should play terraria again

He said I don’t don’t need paints but when it’s armor

The pain when he made a lead short sword instead of a normal sword😢

The best weapon in terraria is the Zenith and you definitely not a veteran in the game.

I was like this at first when i played this game this game i just built a house and stabed the animals.

Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

<a href="">13:26</a> Understandable. Definitely me.

<i>All questions he has asked in this episode</i> :<a href="">1:40</a> - “Can you have a terraria girlfriend, actually?”<a href="">1:44</a> - “Can you frick in terraria?”<a href="">2:09</a> - “How do I build stuff?”<a href="">3:44</a>- “Can you build a meatball in terraria?”<a href="">3:46</a> - “Are there dogs named Sven in terraria?” (How do I get this stuff?)<a href="">4:57</a> - “Can you make beds in mine- terraria?”<a href="">5:38</a> - <b>“HOW COULD YOU?”</b><a href="">5:49</a> - “What can I craft, a wooden hat?”<a href="">9:11</a> - “Why are slimes so evil?”<a href="">9:15</a> - “What the hell is that?”<a href="">10:26</a> - “Ew. What is that?”<a href="">10:48</a> - “whethheutat wadehelisdat?”<a href="">11:13</a> - “Are you kidding me. What the hell is that thing?”<a href="">12:55</a> - “Uh. Excuse me. Excuse me, sorry. What is that? Can I pause?”<a href="">13:12</a> - “Why is that there?”<a href="">13:38</a> - “Woah. What is this?” (<a href="">13:42</a> <a href="">13:58</a> What is this?)<a href="">14:13</a> - “How do I know if it’s daytime or not?”<a href="">14:32</a> - “Is that good?”<a href="">14:33</a> - “CACTUS CHAIR?? What were they smoking when they made this?”<a href="">14:49</a> “There’s a butt? I can make a butt?”<a href="">16:35</a> - “What in the world is that?”

I like how he got his priorities straight because sometimes people just be all over the place. But PewDiePie already has a house and weapons/armor in the first episode. Like usually people would explore and stuff.

<a href="">4:08</a> literally. Terraria ost SLAPS.

Ive never seen anyone beat a vultures axx with a yoyo! 😅😂😂😂 love you Pewds 🤮🐺🌙👊🏼

Bro stardew valley is a ripofc of terria

You know Connery is actually going to help you right that guy he&#39;s going to help you when you have a when you have an item but you don&#39;t know what to use for he will tell you if you go next to him he will tell you

Cactus chair is so comfortably❤❤

I played this game

Nice play 👍💫
Ive always called the guy you start the game with in Terraria Felix, because he looks like Pewdiepie. 😂

hi pewdiepie i'm swedish too
<a href="">4:31</a> this what happens when you play games too much

I bet minecraft payed this dude to not play this game anymore lol.(because it exposes them in everyway)

Can we all appreciate how he made an NPC suitable house by accident?

pila

Right. Click.

I miss Pewds’ gaming videos
He would severely benefit from pressing control.

You kill the bunny it&#39;s say DOOM GUY APPROACHES FROM AFAR

I switched from zenith to yoyo after watching this 💀

As an experienced terrarian the shortsword hurt my soul

it&#39;s so funny watching somoene play this game for the first time 😭😂

<a href="">27:39</a> Stinky brainer
You need to build the house for conner 😢😢😢

You dont have something to catch the rabbit

Build house for connor

Connor need house

Hey connor need house you didn’t build house for connor why???

I have tungsten sword

its good game

&quot;there&#39;s butt you can make butt&quot;🤣

I hope he comes back to terraria to see how far it’s came since.

Peepee poopoo check

I was like &quot;wait what pewds has 4k hours?!&quot; And then he&#39;s just like &quot;those were all lies&quot;. My world is shattered 😂, i feel like the devil may cry screen when you complete missions.

<a href="">11:18</a>also very meaningful story<a href="">6:07</a> - <a href="">6:55</a><a href="">5:36</a> - <a href="">5:41</a><a href="">23:32</a> - <a href="">23:49</a>

<a href="">17:59</a> is that a jojo reference?

You have to build houses for the villagers and for Connor

Terraria player: yoyo😊
it’s lead not lead

Can you Frick in terraria? Very good question lmfao

Dementia, I don&#39;t remember watching this

<a href="">18:41</a>

Can&#39;t believe this man just was like &quot;dafug is dis ping slime&quot; bruh that&#39;s like a 1/500 chance for pinky/the pink slime to spawn.

when will gaming week return?

The phase 2 music is fire the double beats like bro i gotta get this game:/

PLEASE BRING BACK TERRARIA, THIS IS PROBABLY THE THOUSAND TIME IVE SEEN THIS VIDEO CRYING CUZ U LEFT TERRARIA.I CAN JUST IMAGINE THE OUTCOME OF YOU BECOMING A TERRARIA VETERAN AND I CRY CUZ IT DIDNT COME TRUE.

when did I start understanding English
Can’t believe this was a thing for a while, pewdiepie playing terraria, I think I was so hyped bc I had been playing for a long time, that and Minecraft have been phenomenal series.

Feels like it was just yesterday

Here 3 years later

I thought u didnt know to how to play terraria but u know how to play terraria

Is any one gonna talk about the pink slime day 2

God is with yall

Jesus loves you
Looks like Broforse.

I feel like I&#39;m watching a movie 🤣

<a href="">14:52</a> <b>he has obtained the power of the yo</b>

ayeee

I have 43,000 hours

Lead

I mean no harm DIE
Changing his accent every 2 seconds

BRO JUST SUMMONED TERRARIA VETERANS IN EVERY MOVETHIS IS NOT A HOTELCAN WE GO TO MOONPUTTING ARMOR AS CLOTHESCRAFTING SHORTSWORDBEFRIENDING GUIDE

<a href="">25:38</a> pause here and look, did u see the message?? the 5 blocks are placed sus

Bro he is tried from editing

Omg this vid pops up in my recommendations guess I&#39;d watch these series again.

If your 4k makes you a veteran, consider me a legend!
hey that&#39;s the oldest

I played so much Minecraft in my early teen years and just recently I tried terraria and it’s literally so much better, I don’t know if it’s cause I’m just bored of Minecraft now but I just have so much fun on terraria I don’t know why I never played it years ago

<a href="">19:41</a>autism kicks in

Connor: <b>*is your one friend in this cruel world and ready to help you with craft*</b>Pew: Ull dai

Yoyo to joyo to JOJO!!!!!

red should add a guide dialogue to connor that says &quot;these fricken slimes are everywhere!&quot;

WooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooPewds moment <a href="">25:41</a>

<a href="">11:44</a>

when you&#39;r <a href="">23:40</a> in the video conner passes the fence

Here because switch told me to check it ... Had no idea they were promoting a old vid, but this is great!

As a terraria veteran, I appreciate this content. Visual happiness  😊

bro strip mined in terrria

BRO FOUND THE RARE PINKY 1/180 chance

So glad I found this. A lot of times it can be pretty annoying watching people start a game with a lot of complex things cause idk waiting for them to understand feels like it takes forever but pewdiepies reactions to everything are just so funny

Pewdiepie got me into terraria, now I have mastered master mode and am ready for legendary mode

I love how everyone, without fail, kills a squirrel/rabbit on their first playthrough, and immediately regrets it

and he should play tmodloader

Felix is just like me

Felix:can you make beds in mi-terraria

This is so nostalgic, I keep rewatching this series!

I one of the strongest weapons armors😂

nice playthrough man

I play Terraria

The first mistake of him was to craft a wooden armor. The armor points are not worth it, that your character looks that ugly then.. xdand btw; trees grow faster if there are like 2/3 blocks between them. make it 3 just to be sure and because thats the best for minecraft too

Its pronounced led

3 years later realises * ignores the pinky and never gets the cash prize :_ *

watch my latest video about the difference in fps in terraria please

@PewDiePie hi iam u r new subscriber I like the subscriber count. :111m

pewdiepie is like that one annoying kid who watches too much anime

Felix: it’s like minecraft Terraria:I was made months before him

One thing about terraria is that one little upgrade makes the game easier and easier just like in <a href="">15:13</a>

Anyone here has this vid on there recommended?

Proceeds to never complete the game

It&#39;s both funny and infuriating to watch him play

bunAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa

i love that he says he&#39;s so good and he doesn&#39;t even know how to play

i watched this video when it came out and now seeing it after beating the game multiple times and playing the game in generalit makes me remember all the times i would rewatch the same video over and over i wasn&#39;t signed it so i couldn&#39;t watch them all so i rewatched:)

That Antolín swarmed combo tho
&quot;Yes I did a thing!&quot; - Pewdiepie

when he made the lead short sword I cried a little bit

The world is awful !

this game has so bad graphics

i wish u didnt stop playing
what i say to my girlfriend on a daily basis:<a href="">25:03</a>

what i say to my girl bestfriend:<a href="">25:03</a>

i havent played this game for a while, i did random shit when i first played, i was six at the time, i should be good at it now.

Great vunleabrities of kyf

Funny that this is the reason why I play terraria and every single time I make the tower of IKEA as a starting npc residence

fucking “leed “

I like how Felix says he is not poor, while he has a gold coin, 9 coppers and 7 silvers. lol
I watched this when it came out I&#39;m 3 years older now 2023 jan18 12:08am

Minecraft players playing terraria: This looks just like minecraftTerraria players playing minecraft: This looks nothing like terraria

did the guide just kill the bunny that jumped up?

<a href="">3:28</a> LIKE A BOWS

Damn noisy
nice view bro
dint pewdiepie know that despawning exist now his angry at guide

According to me who has played terraria for 4 years, pewd is playing much better than when I played terraria for the first time

Who else missed watching him playing this game? I remember I got soooo hyped when he first uploaded a video terraria.

me: watching at 111 million subs and 11 million views 1.1 million likesnah tat is false

You should join my terraria world-

Soy Terrarianopapu
&quot;LEAD&quot; not lead

I miss these days

Cool video

I miss PewDiePie

THERE ARE DOGS NAMED SVEN!

Pewds: Uses sword on squirrel. Also Pewds: I DIDN&#39;T THINK IT WOULD DO ANYTHING! XD

Pewdiepie:learns game in matter of minutesMe:dosent know how to place a banner and gets scared of bunnies

classic

I created 10000m accounts and I will sub all

Pewds

Conner WANTED - Alive or Dead

Yay let&#39;s not use cactus armour for once lol

Why the lead short sword and not the normal sword

Cuz the FDC won’t let me be. I see you press.

<a href="">10:33</a> pewds= I mean no harm! 2 seconds later… DIE DIE
I’m also a Terraria Veteran and I’m already epic, and I’m very pro and intelligent at the game, because I find all the cool and rare stuff in the game, like the blindfold for example, and that took forever to get and I had to wipe out an entire race of shadow slimes

&lt;3

Him saying poor has similar vibes of Andrew Tate saying brokie

god i know hes a minecraft veteran and that he doesnt know but the house to mesadness

Tungsten was originally known as wolfram as it came most often from it. Later, it was called tungsten due to the fact that it&#39;s heavy and is found in stone. Therefore, tung (heavy) sten (stone)

Menlover68

Today marks the 3rd year of the first time Felix played Terraria

<a href="">4:55</a> <a href="">6:00</a> for a trash taste  reference

<a href="">1:20</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Terraria enemy: <b>dies</b>Terraria enemy: in my last breath….. I will give you money

Bunny: despawnsPewds: and I took that on you, CONNOR

* sees minecart rails *minecart???can I make a minecraft??in minecroft???i am way too easily amused

Forget classic you need to play calamity mod:(

Lol, me rewatching Terraria series all over again...just like I did with the Minecraft one...

fun fact: yes you can craft a meatball in terraria but its a weapon that is made out of crimson bars

peediepie: WUUUU CUCKTOOS CHAAR???? terraria: lets make a cuckoos tolet

I don&#39;t know why...but i am here again.

i played this game in scratch LOL

This is Guile hair cut from street fighter lol

Pewds: What are they smoking when they made this?Cactus chair:  . . . .

Bruh
its zoomed in the entire fucking time

Took me 130 hours to beat  this game lol

I love how he says lead wrong

<a href="">8:50</a> Pewds, the killer of bunnies

This is to date, my favorite PewDiePie thumbnail.

I like how he screamed bunnyyyy! When the bunny died 😂😂😂

He needs to play terraria 1.4.4

Felix: can you go to the moon in terrariaNo the moon comes to kill you

its funny 😂😂<a href="">5:34</a>

&quot;Minecart? Can i make a minecraft in minecrorft?&quot;

I don&#39;t understand anything because I&#39;m from Ukraine and my English is very bad, but I like it

rocking the Ford shirt

Play it again bro &lt;3 hit has lots of things 😂😂😂

Its been 2y! who got recommended this???

As a sidenote try Planet Centauri it&#39;s like terraria but it also has quests and you can tame and ride stuff, wanna ride a cow ok, wanna ride a flippin T rex ok. Also you can turn into animals to with a magic stone. I just bought it. I think I like it.

I want to see you play Rimworld. I was suprised to see no such video when I searched. Seems like a perfect game for you considering how crazy it seems to be. Much stuff can happen there and it has overwhelmingly positive reviews on steam.

Come back to terraria

Noice

<a href="">7:50</a> &quot;dude im good at this game&quot;                     FAX

Terraria veterans be trippin on pewdiepie 1st buying walls instead of blocks

Felix has to jump into Terraria again, with 1.4 and all other huge updates.

Yuoan is tsmo (i have no idea what i typed rn)

You found a rare pinky

&lt;3

I’m the newest comment fuck ya

This series will say to you that trerria isint 2d Minecraft

I was the same I related everything to Minecraft lol I was getting triggered the hole time watching this.

U are literally the reason I have terraria, thank u for bringing it into my life &lt;3

I like how pewdiepie is treating terraria like there’s Minecraft features in it

Legends says this is how mineshafts were created

<a href="">2:33</a><b>Fear noises</b>
The bunny is the Terraria version of watersheep

slime is killers

That house at the start just made my eyes want to die

owner owner owner
pewdiepie to slime - &quot;you took everything from me&quot;wanda to thanos- &quot;you took everything from me&quot;

the amount of bunnies died in this video is more than the slimes i killed in my world lmao

“Connor do something” 😂😂

Who wishes Felix would be their best friend and neighbor

Felix is without question hilarious

So popular that nintendo can&#39;t deny it

&quot;I know chopping trees is the way to go.&quot; Mr. Beast comes over and kills him.

:(

Someone should get Mr.Beast to watch this episode

I write this in 2022 and there was 8 another final Updates

The real legend of fricking copper sword

Pewdiepie: &quot;I mean no harm&quot;Also Pewdiepie: &quot;Die, Die all of you&quot;

Today I learn the etymology and pronunciation of tungsten

I still can’t believe he hit 100 mill first after saying n word on stream

sex

Wait till he figures out there’s a giant squid from space

I spent half an hour trying to use the workbench and EVERYONE just figures it out. It took me a day to figure out I could place down the wood from trees. I was so confused why zombies walking into my house

Me and my friend watched this no joke this was mine and his reactionMy friend: “Bruh he’s just playing 2D minecraft ripoff”Me: facepalms and searches up why terraria is not 2d minecraft and made him watch it till he admited it wasntNow he loves terraria XD

I remember the very first time I played terraria and I spawned in a corruption biome.🤣

“I mean no harm”“Die, die, die, all of you”-Pewdiepie
connor is a guide tells you how the game works the guide tells you how to get npcs (peoples)you need a light source (lamp) a chair and a table the npcs will move to your town if theres an arms dealer buy guns

Tungtsen IS a heavy metal

Tip: you can kill the wall of flesh by beenade Second tip:you can summon the wall of flesh by throwing a guide doll in the hell undergroundThird tip: you can get the doll by slaying a voodoo doll demonFourth tip: you can get the beenade by slaying the queen beeFifth tip: you can summon the queen bee by destroying the queen bee&#39;s gel thingie in the beehiveTip is now over I&#39;ll comment again If you want to learn it yourself I&#39;m sorry I spoiled it I wanted to help you a little😁

What I&#39;m attracted to Pewdiepie&#39;s videos is the way he plays the game spontaneously and doesn&#39;t care about the mistakes he makes.From Viet Nam with love &lt;3

Pewds subconsciously promoting his Minecraft series for 27 minutes straight

The fallen stars are rare to make the star cannon and also make an cosumable mana star

Me like terraria

I&#39;m good at terraria but not a veteran and I have a zenith

My names Connor and I feel offended

one of the best games out there despite being 10 years old its so good. im playing on master difficulty and its a blast with a friend

<a href="">9:46</a>))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

Godly yelet is a strong yoyo

In 1.4.0 update has 15 bosses

‘Do you want to drink some lead’

<a href="">3:47</a>. Red: Write that down. Write that down.

As somone who has 72 hours in a month hes doing good

As a certified Connor, I feel offended you wouldn’t let one of my kind sleep with you smh

Now you have bed

Imagine if Connor had a different name. The playthrough whould be different.

Pewds: (gets lead bars) LEAD SHORTSWORD? LETS MAKE IT.

<a href="">9:55</a> is PewDiePie wearing a Zelda hat?

Ah yes &quot;Can I make a minecraft in minecroft?&quot;

<a href="">10:34</a> When the spanish discover America

GAMING WEEK

What do you mean it has a end now it has had a end long before the last update

The guide trick shotted the bunny damn

<a href="">17:19</a> put it on 25% speed.

I remember when I watched this video for the first time, I was so amazed and I downloaded a pirate version of terraria(It was 1.3.0 while the game was like 1.3.5) But I bought terraria after 1 year, when I had completed terraria on the pirate version. Good times, ah, good times.

Many bunnies were harmed in the making of this video

I hope after Skyrim , Pewds goes back to Terrraria to finish ithe ddint finish both game hahasadge

He would make every game fun

He would make every game fun

go until you beat all 31 bosses

Very nice I suggest you get the early game armour

This guy ignored a fuckin pink slime but freaked out over a star

Terraria is better than Minecraft anyone?

Ben despawned.
Too bad YouTube removed dislikesNow that 1 million dislikes are none lol

my brain fuckig hurts when he doesnt use wooden platforms

Terraria is very coolBecause it is li e minecraftWow

Fun fact: If the town dog is a husky, it has a chance to be named Sven.

First video of terrariaAlready building for wall of flesh be like:

&quot;I&#39;m from foreign lands, i come in peace.&quot;<b>5 seconds later</b> &quot;DIE! You&#39;re dead, and now the other one is.&quot; good job felix, you are now a traitor.

<a href="">23:52</a> :(

This is a better title very popular Swedish  man vs terraria

&quot;lead&quot;

Yo dońt chop them whole, just the top so the trees grow back

<a href="">0:17</a> İTS RUDOLF VON STROHEİM
I’ve killed final boss and I’m not this good

Damn u are the funniest guy I ever seen on YouTube because u are naming a cactus desert tree

<a href="">5:35</a> i was expecting ”he was like a father to me”

He actually found Pinky on the second day

Hey PewDiePie I actually I was what I was just like you whenever I was lonely game literally and now I have the nights edge

Mans character lookin like von stroheim
I am the first comment in the 3/12/2021

I started really similar except it took me an hour to figure out how to craft because i thought it was like in minecraft where you have to click on it not open the inventory

“Leeed”

i wish pewds&#39;ll play this fantastic game again....

I like how Connor just walks in as if it&#39;s a 90s sitcom

its been exactly 2 years from when video was releasd

<a href="">2:26</a> says he didnt think it would do anything after hitting the squirle twice

I assume the further down you go the more epicness you get, just like wamen. Guys with 2inch peepee : sad noises*

<a href="">4:31</a> bo burnham, inside (2021)
mr beast please look away &gt;&lt;

when someone says &quot;try 2d minecraft&quot;

This makes me miss terraria

Pewds: can you make meatballs in this game?Me: well… I mean… kinda…

“Can you build a meat ball in terraria”… yes? Technically it is called the meatball

I mean you no harm DIE <b>aggressively stabs</b>

PewDiePie would be happy we have dogs in terraria now and I think you can get the name Sven

Everyone else chillin.          Pewdiepie: cactus chair

Nic

tungsten is actually the heaviest metal, also i find it funny you&#39;re wearing a ford racing jacket

His character looks like polnareff
If you want the &quot;guy&quot; you need a housingA housing require crair,table,torch,wallYou dont need a mincart to ride the rail

Your tin lead can make a better thingies

<a href="">17:57</a> is a JOJO REFERENCE

polnareff gaming
<a href="">17:56</a> omgggg ahhahahahhah JOJOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😂😂😂
Felix makes character ekhm I mean polnareff 😂

Pewdiepie: i am slaying Moonlord: allot me to introduce myself

I think the yoyo is good for pic players but cactus sword is good for mobile players but that&#39;s just what I think

this is money game :/

There are diamonds but they are useless

I already beat the game months ago

<a href="">25:38</a> when I see pewds playing terraria

This is the very first time I ever watched this guy&#39;s video and I gotta say I now know why people keep talking about oompa looking like PewDiePie

Yes Diamonds are in the game

TERRARIA GANG!!

Pinkkie: 6 damageFelix: Omg its super strongMeanwhile master mode enemies: Am I a Joke to you?

Its really fun to see youtubers react to new stuffBtw, terraria veteran here

i love how he kept confusing lead with mercury and told us to not drink it though we can&#39;t unless heated a lot lol

Beat me... İN CALAMİTY!
sive stop zooming bro
theres actuly diamonds in terraria

<a href="">5:43</a>

Dont kill Bunneh
Bunneh is love

&quot;Can you Frick in TeRRaria !?&quot; ~A YouTuber with more than 110 million subscribers.

“Cactus Chair! What were they smoking when they made this!” My insides hurts!🤣

Did he accidentally make polnareff??? The pants and the shirt changed colors tho

I was gonna say that he will kill so many bunnies with the shield of Cthulhu but i remember he doesn&#39;t even play expert mode.

Minecraft and Terraria Expert:Terraria will always be better than Minecraft, fyi I&#39;m the Minecraft and Terraria expert

Sees demon eye... “can I pause?!”
everybody should know that &quot;this is not a hotel&quot;

Me who has beat terraria: phatetic

<a href="">5:35</a> )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

You eat dirt you get hurt life lesson right there

Your so useless but you still have to die haha

im from sweden to lol and i have playe teraria and if you dont belive that i come from sweden i can say one word from sweden hej alla that is swedish

<a href="">14:35</a> cactus chair!!!! Lolololol
Who had that ouch moment after Felix crafted a Short-sword xD

yall found that ore called &quot;leed&quot; yet?

It hurts to see him place the wall of the house, but then make the frame AFTER!!!😩

hi

the pink silim is rich,  you miss it!

Felix: Makes lead short sword.Me: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO :(
Felix: Leed ore.Me: Lead ore.

:O

Have u ever wondered why felix never got any achivments???

Fake sans here (maybe) I came here and Finally been happy after like a billion resets

&quot;there&#39;s giant floating eye ball&quot;Excuse me, GIANT ?<a href="">7:06</a>

Pewdiepie is not getting that much subscribers

Everything becomes becomes better when filex touches it

I feel pain when watching this. Terraria is infinitely more sophisticated than minecraft. There are many bosses, mobs, weapons, ores, merchants and even a second part to the game, with a hallow biome. Please become a pro at Terraria, like me!

Pewdiepie:&quot;Ikea tower will be the largest structure this world has ever seen&quot;Floating islands:&quot;I&#39;m about to break this whole man&#39;s career&quot;

Felix: Stabs squirrel with a sword....*Squirrel dies* Felix: Noooooooooooooooooooooooo

i just started playing today

it’s more fun watching pewds than playing the game

Why did he pick the lead shortsword. the lead broadsword is way better

Ben despawned lol.

<a href="">18:46</a> so... connor it&#39;s a homosexual or what the fuck??

Why does the Thumbnail look like jacksepticeye

kills a bunny&#39;i swear i won t do that again&#39;kills 3 more

He wants to kill guide

He is like I&#39;m strong cactus sword does 9 damage The actual veterans have the terra blade which does 200 damage

FINALLY TERRARIA

Best terraria series in youtube

Im got terraria

I have returned to watch once more, amazing gameplay Pewds!

felix character reminds me of a street fighter characters with yellow blond hair whit that hairstyle and a tank top and sum baggy jeans

Even though this video is old I want to see this man suffer

Who doesn't understand anything 😂
I just played a few days ago and it&#39;s been so long I forgot how to make walls and I died so many time at night houseless.

Just here rewatching the series to reminisce those sweet memories.

If anybody has it on ps4 add me and we can trade

“I won’t do that again, I Swear”

bruh his hair is koichi or little polnarref

JOTAROOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

bruh, i just bought this game and thought it was a platformer.

I play terraria and you did pretty good for a start in this episode

The whole poor jokes all the time I don&#39;t really find funny because it&#39;s most of us poor ass people watching your content for a laugh that&#39;s intern paying your bills so think about who&#39;s actually really poor here

This aged better than a fine wine! And by that I mean that I am enjoying watching this more so now that some time has passed

pog

Watching this after having over 200 hours in terraria is slightly cringy, like If I was there he&#39;d know how to play lol

Pewdiepie after killing 17829 bunnies’i wont do that again’

pewds using yoyo for the first time is like an anime protag learning his powers

this might have been the lowest quality video from pewds i&#39;ve ever watched

pew its so bad at terraria LMAOits a joke

Felix: i mean no harmAlso Felix a few seconds: die die
Pewds: I am strong nowMe who has never played the game, thus making it so that no monsters can come even close to touching me, making me op:

Connor CAN talk to you xD]

Pewdiepie: <b>kills slime</b> I’m good at this game!!Me: <b>kills wof</b> I’m almost good

You need a table and chair to spawn npc

Egg

<a href="">16:49</a> me a virgin whenever i have a conversation with a girl

Yeees the Leed anvil

Lead = Led
Ur actually doing pretty good for a beginner

It really annoys me that his mine is not straight down

Man i beated thé game

Felix:&quot;Why are slime so evil&quot;Red Rimuru: &quot;Im a Bad Slime&quot;

Final Fantasy 3 guy haven&#39;t difrent of Terraria guy

lame terraria

My terraria Is so opJourney

It said 8.2k dislikes then I disliked and it was 8.3k

<a href="">1:50</a> the first thing he asks about terraria Seriously

i beated it yesterday and have killed moonlord like 14 timesto obtain zenith   P.S felix is bad at this

Someone call peta on this man

<b>Joyo</b>

I&#39;ve never played terraria so I&#39;m literally learning with him.

There&#39;s no diamonds in Terraria

felix: * shanks squirrel *also felix: how durst thou perish before thine blade

Btw next year Terraria im pre sure is getting an update! :)

petition to rename yoyo&#39;s into jojo&#39;s

Its been a very long time since i watched pewds

<a href="">26:09</a> latterly killua

Pee pee Poo poo

man i want him to do another playthrough

No the pinkyyyyyy

<a href="">2:35</a> I’m proud that I was apart of this series 🥲

Knows its a cactus*Breaks it*&quot; <b>It didn&#39;t drop any wood</b> &quot;

My favorite YouTuber playing my favorite game is awesome

This video felt like yesterday

If the yo-yo is his dog, then it’s name should be Sven?

Yes he’s playing my favorite game and I’m rewatching it!!

&quot;What is that adorable thing? Conner stay away from it, stay away from it&quot; LOL

<a href="">1:56</a> when he tries to mine a wall with a pickaxe instead of a hammer XD

im an actual terraria veteran and i cant wait to see how bad this will be

Bunny was the terraria version of Figi

And so he ended the series by locking it behind a paywall the end goodnight

alternate title: minecraft RPG
too zoomed in the entire time

Minecraft &amp; Terreria Terrcraft

Mimecraft &amp;

I like how he pronounces lead like leed instead of led lol

<a href="">1:21</a> &quot;Minecraft be like &#39;Hands! Just use your hands!&#39;&quot; IDK what it is about this sentence that makes me laugh so much XD! Then again, it may just be the animation. lol

Yes, let&#39;s go mine some leed

:D

I got mad at work today, so Ive just bought the game

And you can also get a pet dog in terraria

Terraria finally were moon lord

I didn&#39;t know how to build on my first night so I just dug a 2×4 hole in the ground and zombies would keep coming in and killing me haha... in that same world I know have the Zentih, and the Eventide, and so much more. I love terraria too much

My names conor u talking to me?

<b>&quot;WoAh WaTer fLoWS DOwN?&quot;</b>Someone has clearly been playing too much Minecraft.

Borest game ever

My first time I filled my house with block instead of wall so I’m actually impressed

<a href="">11:14</a> -  <a href="">11:32</a> OKAY YOU  WIN finally

Bro how is the video so grainy but his webcam isn’t?

This hairstyle is like an anvil!

I mean pewds
Press is not cool

hello pudidi
I mean killua kills people with a yoyo so your right

I won&#39;t do it again ......sinister laughter

Me killed aSlime

Being a terraria veteran I’m deeply angered

&quot;I won&#39;t do it again I swear&quot;proceeds to do it 10 more times

I swear terraria gameplay is B E S T gameplay

As someone who has over 100 hours of play time, I must say I&#39;m impressed

Bruh did SAAFTOO just change places
Wait the mins the demon eye did not kill the bunny Conner accident shot the arrow to bunny because he&#39;s among in the demon eye

At least he has multiple floors of his house. But seeing him knowing how to make platforms yet still leaving big holes in his floors is painful. So is the fact that he never talked to the Guide.

Pewdipie:can you make a meatball:me: : /

The best series game i ever watch so far

What&#39;s that pinky

And Conner did not kill the bunny the bunny just dispawn

And Conner  is helpful killing him would be bad

terraria veterans: facepalms*

stop killing slimes im the slime king

I am part of death=)

Yes you can make bed

He kept saying &quot;I Swear&quot; But he kept doing it again😆

Every time pewds sees a new monsterPewds: What are you, your scary go away.Pewds seeing the same monster for the second time 10 seconds laterAlso Pewds: WEAK!! SHORT!!!

He got a short sword instead of broadsword

Dummy person

i remember being the 13th veiw on this video and it being 3 hours old lol

I got a Wendy’s ad and I’m hungry

<a href="">11:30</a> This is me, who saw a hornet that flew into the house.

Just wait untill he gets a Zenith

<a href="">1:24</a> HaNdS JuSt UsE YoUr HaNdS
you monster y u kill the squirrel

Im who knows very much of terraria I’m just so annoyed that he doesn’t clear the wood outside

<a href="">11:48</a> )))))))))))))))))))))))))

BOGA BOGA BOGA

You can build infinite

The bunny part had me laughing so hard

Mobile players with yoyo: auto aim on

Me looks at him with endgame guns

I think that his Minecraft day died a lot and he just kept on replacing him

Felix- I am strong now !Nights edge- So cuteLast prism- <b>SO ADORABLE</b>

5.36 was exactly my reaction when I saw a slime killed my bunny 🤣🤣🤣🤣

<a href="">5:38</a> rip bunny

<a href="">1:23</a> lol

Hands

This is just 28 minutes of pewds saying &quot;Im sorry I wont do that again&quot;

Gaming week! I update my laptop cpu and gpu whith intel program

so much pain he crafted a shortsword

Help the Cuban people please

my mother wondering why pewdiepie i yelling my name

I kill all that’s poor.Me: welp, guess I’ll die.

Thank you for gaming terraria

Polnareff! !
There are diamonds just there pretty useless

Tougher enemies will cum

Whaaat?! You can make bridges in terraria?

It took me an hour to figure out that walls existed in this game 😅😅😅

This game is very hard

Pewds: This isn’t a hotelMe: foreshadowing

<a href="">2:36</a> &quot;He can&#39;t even talk to me&quot; Lol literally the guide&#39;s entire job

in terraria u r able to mine diamonds with a fish

DIAMONDS

That one off centered wall that’s barely outside the house is giving me intense ocd

PewDiePie: I’m not poorMe with my platinum coins:

<a href="">20:31</a> I loved that part😂

Tungsten hahahaha
Pog iron shortsword dam

:Hits a rabbitRabbit: diesNOOOOOOOOO!?

Liked the video

yes there are diamonds in terraria but its super rare,i played terraria for two years and just have 11 diamonds

Lead

When I first started terraria it took me a whole hour to achieve what pewds did in three minutes you don&#39;t know how long it took me to realize I can&#39;t interact with crafting tables and furnaces.

Looks like von strohime
Pewdiepie: No ConnErs allowedConnOr: I&#39;m 4 parallel universes ahead of you

Felix: “can you go to the moon in terraria?”<b>No moon comes to you</b>

He said FTC Flights team stand up

<a href="">1:23</a>

He chose violence as soon as he got in

Felix: had enough lead to make a broadswordAlso Felix: makes a short sword insteadMe: <b>T R I G G E R E D</b>

“Are there diamonds in terraria” yes. Yes there are. But they do like literally nothing

I have finished the game,and what he does at the start of the video bring me pain

&quot;Can you frick in Terraria?&quot;Rule 34 artists: <b>Well....</b>

First slime he kills and he gets 50 plus silver, is that normal?

After my first twenty minutes I had an ancient shadow breastplate drop from an enemy.

PewDiePie: (is beginner and learnt very quick)Me: HE IS LEARNING AT LUDICROUS SPEEDSSS!

Man it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen a door been crafted instead of using platforms

jokes on him if conner dies he has to wait for another guide because you need the guide alive to summon the wall of flesh xD

“I won’t do that again, I swear” MEANINGLESS 🥲

R.I.P Bunny

When will he know that it’s not pronounced leed it’s pronounced led.If it is just how u pronounce in in Sweden then pls don’t hate me

its funny cuz me and the guide here have the same name

His name should have been saladass

I am a terraria veteran I have not played in 6 years also I would play with my cousin and he would get all the gear all I would do was paint our house and summon bosses for fun but I’m still a veteran kinda

there is a weapon called the meat ball

Leed

What the fu*k t series add in his video

I remember pewds somewhere saying he would release an <b>adult fun</b> tape when he hits 110 mil

Hi i am from india plese tel me name in 1 june live stream 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀👻💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀☠☠💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
as a veteran, i am severely pissed that he ignored pinky. 💀💀

I can&#39;t get over the fact that he made a SHORTSWORD

&quot;How does it feel to be too short?&quot;Me being 4,11: ¯\_༼ ಥ ‿ ಥ ༽_/¯
Pewdiepie: &quot;this is not a hotel&quot;every npc: &quot;are you sure about that?&quot;

Why you hit so mach israel im have to know why you care abute this

Pewds playing genocide route in terraria

No Conners

Me: sees FordMe: look at the time

Conner I’m sorry you can’t sleep with me -pewdiepieBest sentense ever spoken.

I’ve been playing since i was like 2 I would consider myself a vet

Connor:helps pewdipiePewdipie:Destroys Connor in lavaMe:*dislikes the videoMy friends:bruh he helped you why did you burn ConnorMy whole family:RIP ConnorPewdipie:hey! No fair!

Do you have finch staff? I do.

It an i-bol(eyeball)

I like how no matter who you are. Terraria always hypnotizes you into killing small animals.

R.I.P bunny

Terraria is pretty much 2d Minecraft that is heavily modded

<a href="">16:50</a> TOUCH IT TOUCH IT I SAID TOUCH IT!

Pewdiepie after killing 15 bunniesA slime killed a bunnyPewdiePie: BUNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

I remember when I first got this game when I was very young I built a tower as tall as I could just for fun I went to the top as I built it …And to my surprise, a horrifying raging demon bird thing has been watched me and waiting for me the entire time and it started attacking me in the sky.

Hi new sub :)
* stabs squirrel repeatedly with a sword *<b>OMG WHY DID IT DIEEEE</b>* does the same thing to a bunny and it dies ** SURPRISED  PIKACHU FACE *

PewDiePie: WHY DID THE SLIME KILL THE BUNNY!!!! Me: you just killed three like 20 seconds ago 😂

<a href="">3:45</a> the meatball is a weapon

Can i make a minecraft in minecarft!?

&quot;Defence&quot;

<a href="">9:28</a>

Does pewdiepie ever pronounce &quot;lead&quot; correctly 😂

Never craft a shortsword!!!!!!!!!!

<b>Felix plays Terraria</b>Me: OMG, Terraria is my favorite game! This is the golden age of gaming!

This is beautiful

He made a lead shortsword. Actually kill me

less then 2 minutes in:Can you frik in Terraria?

“Im good at this game” digs diagonally

As a terraria veteran this almost hurts to watch

Number one rule of minecr uh Terraria is to dig straight down

I played this game since I was a kid.

1vs1 in terraria you are good

<a href="">2:33</a> Detroit: Become Guide

&quot;The more you go down the more you get epic&quot;

Well filex (I dunno if that&#39;s right)that&#39;s one thing we have in common we know nothing abt terraria and everything abt minecwaft btw love ur vids

Is anyone else annoyed that he says lead like leed lol

I have a last prism

The quote of the episode &quot;I swear I won&#39;t do it again&quot;

Bruh i wanna scream at him HAMMER for the excess walls

Fucking hate that he locked the rest of the series behind a fucking subscription.

Pewdiepie: i wont kill the bunny again Pewdiepie: does it again

<b>STOP</b> <b>KILLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>RABBITS</b>

More please if you got a item you dont know go to google terrai wiki

Now that you&#39;re a Minecraft veteran. Will you be a Terraria veteran next?

It was pewds who got me hooked on terraria so I bought the game feb 23 and it is now March 28th and I 80 hours in this game it is also my favorite game so thanks pewds

pewdiepie.
<a href="">8:29</a> anyone notice that the mining stone sound sounds like music

I wont do that agen
Well in journey&#39;s end if u buy an dog license u get an chance to get sven the dog! (Buy the license from the furry girl)

He needs a mount

when i was watching this he was so patchietic

pewds: im not a veteran at terrariaalso pewds 2 seconds later: im a veteran

How can someone play this trash

Pewdiepie: kills bunny Also him: I won&#39;t do that again Later kills bunny

thar are 13 boss in terraria

Is this a jojo referenceI mean hes character looks like polnaref

Minecraft is great, but Sandbox is the future and it will make you rich, if you get in early

Why does his character look like guile

Finally we have proof that terraria isn&#39;t a minecraft clone!

The person who killed bunnies himself:  BUNNYYYYYYYYY! YOU... (slime) TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!

I got suggested this video because Eliminate fans also watched it LMAO Girth Gang where are y&#39;all

WOW HE iGNORED PINKY

<a href="">13:28</a> that&#39;s why i fill all nearby caves with sticky dirt bomb around my builds

i like how he is not digging straight down.

His hair looks like an anvil in terraria

Pewdiepie: I mean no harma milisecond later PewidePie: Die DIE  <a href="">10:32</a>
Leed do you mean lean?
<a href="">6:55</a> the bunny massacre of 2021

<a href="">25:47</a> I thought a mosquito was flying around my ear

<a href="">8:07</a> Yes, you can find Diamonds in terraria

This is like pouring the milk before the cereal at <a href="">3:16</a>

his character looks like polnerafle

You should take a broad sword not short sword

Dont mind me im just gonna binge watch this cuz im bored af

Used to play this with friends on mobile in like 3rd grade and it’s honestly underrated af

It hurt my physically to watch felix make shortsword when he couldve made broadsword out of lead

if you like yoyos then you might like a mace. go mining and open yelow(gold) chests. maces are yoyos but stronger

put chair and torch in house then make some shoeboxes and helpful NPCs will move in if the conditions are met(go to terraria wiki/guide(connor))

Pewdiepie sees the poor animals blood Pewdiepie :help Connor i killed a rodent and it needs to be healed

Change to 144p for best experience

Felix: &quot;Ahahah, he&#39;s too short. How does it feel to be too short?&quot;Me: <b>sobbing</b> &quot;Not good.&quot;

dont drink lead paint or youll cry cry cry

its pronounced &quot;led&quot; not &quot;leed&quot;

NAH NAH NAH ITS THE SAME F WORLD AS MINE BRUH AND IM PLAYING ON NINTENDO AND I JUST GOT THE Game on CHRISTMAS

Hi ff hacker
Rolf: what a nice day in terrariaFelix: (pulls out unto reverse card)

Pewds: are there DIAMONDS IN TERRARIAme: yes but not useful

I heard this game have a film named made in abyss

clearing out the area and making a flat one is super useful for events
