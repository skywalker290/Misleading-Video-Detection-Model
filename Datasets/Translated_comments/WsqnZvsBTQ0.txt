Keep it up bro. Love from Pakistan.🇵🇰 bro india or pakistan ke logon ko ladwane wale ka koi religion nahi hai. Ap India or Pakistan ke pyar pr video bnaen or awaz uthaen ke jo log yeh sab krte hain humme unse bachna chahiye or unko support nhi krna chahiye. Mohabbat 1 bohat pyari cheez hai or yeh cheez har insan mein honi chahiye. And so sorry ke apko politician kaha ap samjh toh gaye hi honge ke hum sabko apas mein ladwane wale yeh politicians hi hain jo dono countries mein beth kr hum sabko aik dusre ke khilaaf kar rhe hain. Koi or nata nhi tou insaniyat ka tou nata haina hum sabka. Mazhab ke naam pr ladwane wale ka khud koi mazhab nhi hota. Fasadi insan ka koi mazhab nhi hota koi deen nahi hota.🇵🇰🇮🇳

At <a href="">8:02</a> Ashish can&#39;t control his smile 

I have come to watch Bharmastra or I have come across this video of Ashish Chanchalni, I have watched these ads or watched the rate of popcorn, I have been thinking that as long as ads are coming, I have come to comment. It seems to me that these BC Cinepolis are either charging money or showing ads, so it would be better to go to a cheap local theater and watch the movie without ads or save the money. I am not going to eat ads, I am watching this video, I am walking, the movie is about to start.
