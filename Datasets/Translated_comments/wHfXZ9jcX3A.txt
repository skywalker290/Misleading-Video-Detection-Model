Noo that beautiful car is broken now

The Fast and Furious Franchise should have Ended here only. There was no need For Dom&#39;s Brother.

best

That&#39;s one fast submarine

this is my favorite movie ❤

That&#39;s not the way firecworks but whatever.

<b>Letty:</b> (reaction of Cipher) This (beep) is crazy!<b>Me:</b> I agree with you, Letty.

Love these movies but i stg if i were one of them i would beat Dom up for always trying to kill himself. damn

That would be a hell of a tire advertisement because I sometimes can’t go from a standstill without spinning everywhere…..and stopping from 80mph on ice like that within 20feet?   I can’t do that when I’m on asphalt

Its Fast and Furious guys.. they&#39;ll make a corner store shift gears and travel 100mph of they think its a good idea. Stop putting so much thought into this BS

Cameraman had to be taken above the fireball just in time to prove cameraman never dies!

That whole thing that we just watched was about as believable as me crapping out a $1,000,000 from my hole!

This series went from a family oriented street race/crime movie series to a full blown classic call of duty campaign

<b>Dom:</b> (to Cipher) I destroyed two of your teams. I killed your red-headed boyfriend and I put two killers on your untraceable plane. You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon. Now guess who I&#39;m coming for.



<b>Me:</b> I love that line.

<a href="">1:09</a> “I killed your red-headed boyfriend” She knew she messed with the wrong team

Hey Star Wars, that&#39;s how you make a good part 8.

Amazing that his family all drove in front of Dom and protected him from the blast.

And THAT is how you give your villain the middle finger without killing them.

Roman and hobbs crazy team 😂😂😂

Does anyone know the name of the soundtrack in this scene? I&#39;ve been looking for an eternity now <a href="">0:49</a>

<a href="">0:15</a> look out<a href="">0:46</a> that’s my girl

I like the part where the cars surrounded him to protect him

Wait? No one&#39;s gonna talk about how did he outrun a heatseeker?Oh I get it!! Family, right?

Poor Charlize Theron 😢

The “we have family”, “avengers” jokes here are getting SO old

What song do they use in this scene?

<a href="">1:21</a> Put A Heat Seeker On Now<a href="">1:24</a> What<a href="">1:25</a> NOW 👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
<a href="">3:19</a> That was Hot

This is the scene that lost me forever. Never bothered again after this crap.

<a href="">0:06</a> Roman: &quot;Get us outta here!&quot;Hobbs: &quot;Why are you always yelling?&quot;That was a great and hilarious question from Hobbs. 😂😂

&quot;Get us out of here! Why are you always yelling?&quot;

<a href="">2:16</a> : &quot;This is for my SON&quot;🗿🔥

Bro,wow!❤
I like that how Dom was getting chased by the missile and he doesn&#39;t even care 😂 LoL

<a href="">2:39</a> for &quot;DOM!!!&quot;

<a href="">1:37</a>&quot;thats a goddamn heat seeker coming at us

tell. me how dom. is surviving the car crashes

Somehow Wonder Woman works with Cipher and has a Submarine of her own.

Wow, in <a href="">2:18</a> Dom did that for his son..... :O

<a href="">0:13</a> Letty: This b is crazy. Me: Took the words right out of my mouth.

<a href="">3:10</a> i love how all of them used their cars to shield dom it just makes me so happy

If you&#39;re older than 7 years old and you still enjoy watching this movie, don&#39;t forget your helmet before you leave the house.

isn&#39;t there a nuc on the submarine how come the explosion didn&#39;t blow up the nuc?

In reality:&quot;That&#39;s a godda-...&quot; BOOM!End credits.

Cipher ruined the franchise. Period

I wonder what Will the government do for chaos in their country

Family stick up for each other

When dom said that&#39;s my girl so cute

Dude what?

I like how they are trying to stop the NUCLEAR sub from escaping yet they decide to blow it up  when the warhead is in it

<a href="">2:41</a> not the gtx!

<a href="">1:21</a>Cipher:Put a heat-seeker on him nowNOW!

Cipher let this be a lesson.Never ever mess with FAMILY

When we got family not even a heatseeker MISSLE can out run a car

How The Military Armored Car Made It That Far? <a href="">0:05</a>

HHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHA

<a href="">1:26</a> Man, she’s nuts.
Even submarine had shift gears
<a href="">2:39</a> <a href="">1:25</a>

Thats my girl 😏

<a href="">2:39</a> DOM!!! 😂😂😂

Dom&#39;s car literally went supersonic.

They&#39;ll learn bout this in physics class

Because family
Film shows cars can go faster than missiles. And With all  respect to Paul walker ,may his soul RiP.This movie shows a cars can protect from huge blast.But sadly Paul couldn&#39;t survive from car accident.

Why not just drive left or right? Away from the sub instead of going straight to where it can chase you? The car can easily maneuver away whereas the sub would make wide turns

Dom cars don&#39;t have flares

People always criticize these movies but they forget that physics does not exist in the F&amp;F universe.

bullshit if that sub fast then car

They would’ve won if they didn’t surface the sub

<a href="">3:09</a>Dom and the team are great and lucky they survived such blast.--I just imagine if fifth spirit elsa used her ice barrier to block the flames if she will succeed just like how she succeeded in protecting her castle against a huge wave caused by the dam&#39;s destruction.

sub chasing fast cars 😞
Dom’s crew/family on a mission. One scared, everyone having fun while focusing on the objective

Roman: GET US OUTTA HERE!!!!Hobbs: Why are you always yelling?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Wait is don a dad

Meaning of a true family family never betrays

Yeah, that&#39;s not how fire works.

I hate all of the new Fast And Furious movies they are just to high tech I loved the old classic street racing I think Fast 7 was the last best fast and furious

Most people don&#39;t know that missiles only fly at 200mph or less, and can penetrate the double steel bulkhead of a submarine, and that all automobiles have an anti-fire force shield.

M15+ action violence and coarse language

Boom!

lol

Typical Hollywood movie..full of BS like their own people

Now that&#39;s family.Also, outracing a heat-seeker and slamming it straight back into the sub? Priceless tension!

Dom&#39;s teammates protect for Dom. That scene explains why FF series famous for global fans.

<a href="">0:07</a>

<a href="">2:20</a> <a href="">2:21</a> <a href="">2:22</a> <a href="">2:27</a><a href="">2:31</a> <a href="">2:36</a><a href="">2:41</a> <a href="">2:42</a> <a href="">2:43</a> <a href="">2:46</a>

I re-visit this clip and still laughing when dom outruns a missile that looks like an aim 9 going at mach 2.5  Too bad for the pilots, they must think fast in a few seconds until impact.

<a href="">1:25</a>

Rob Didney Speaks (Explicit)

Does anyone know where I can get Toretto&#39;s jacket?

Her shouting at <a href="">1:26</a> 🤣😂

Why are you always yelling?! Lol 😂

<a href="">3:09</a> Letty and The Crew Came To Rescue Dom

Maybe just a stupid thought, but changing the direction is not an option?

Not even fire is saved from the lack of physics here.

<a href="">1:25</a>

Loki: We have the Hulk.Dom: I have family.

Dom is basically superman at this point.🤣bro should be in the hospital but nope he never gets hurt when being in a car crash🤣.

Don&#39;t understand the power of family

<a href="">1:04</a> My Best Clip

Totally real dont @ me

Even cipher survived the look on her face accepting loss is pure payback

Why everyone is talking about physics its entertainment so just enjoy amd feel🖤

when dom got caught in the fire thats exactly what i want to feel in the shower a balance between cold and warm

the funny thing that is an aim9l its launched from plane and commonly used on the a10 warthog

Goosebombs when i see the saving at the end

These people for their personal interest and friendship can destroy the whole world😂

in the multiverse....Dom has no family...

The only things is Wrong is thatAkula submarine is so fast even if breaking the ice and that anti Aircraft heat seeking missile can go hypersonic maybe like Mach 4.6 Mach 1 is equivalent to the speed of sound so that thing is almost 5x the speed of sound 🤣🇷🇺

This is pretty much what I expected when I clicked on &quot;Fate of the Furious, heat seeking missile scene&quot;.

Next movie is about fight against god and bringing  paul back from heaven.

loved every Single movie because i watch movies for Entertainment. And not logic

Who cares if these things doesn’t make sense? They are very fun to watch

Dom literally yeeted physics from his family. Best daddy ever

So I guess everyone had the same idea at the same time? Not only that, they were able to get into a perfect formation without crashing into one another for the same spot. And the fact that this worked. No cars flew, no glasses broken. Nothing flew over the cars and landed on Dom or anything. Nice

<a href="">02:27</a> II... AAAAAM.... GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!

Okay, I know this movie ignored physics entirely, but if that explosion is huge and emerged from under the ice, shouldn&#39;t it crack all the ice surrounding the area?

Last 4 movies this mf dom just dont die . He must have nine lives

Masterpiece!

Team work makes the dream work <a href="">3:09</a>

What he should&#39;ve done is break the ice and go underwater to avoid fire.

This is a nice movie

That should not be real

Now dats what you call family

Fast and furious real too the need for speed route

Poor armoured vehicle driver. Crushed by ice and steel.

Fast 10: Your Seatbelts
The movie is so stupid but good at the same time

<a href="">2:41</a>

The story With my best friend Father died

<a href="">0:09</a> why are you always yelling lmao

<a href="">1:23</a>

Logic: Physics Dom: Family😈

Omtyerwds
Tanckyou im iran👍👍👍👍
I love when people complain about physics in an action movie lmao.

Definitely how heatseakers work definitely wont be blinded on the ground

<a href="">3:00</a>

Why Hollywood always mess up missile related scenes:#1 A Heat Seeker or any missile don&#39;t follow the target they predict the  position where the target will be at a given time and it intercept the target. #2 Dom will never be able to outrun any missile as they travel at a high speed i.e. it can reach upto 2.25 Mach and is impossible to outrun them with a car.#3 At <a href="">2:02</a>, Dom would&#39;ve been already dead. Missile don&#39;t change their course and also it would have exploded and killed him even before he turns.#4 Even if he was able to outrun, a missile won&#39;t comeback after you. Ever.#5 By the time Dom reached the submarine, the missile would&#39;ve ran out of fuel.#6 Missile don&#39;t make physical contact with their target or any object they explode before contact and it&#39;s the fragments that causes the damage.

I Vin Diesel I know his son

Laws of physics in this movie: <b>No.</b>

why doesn’t any of the videos show the full wheelie ???

Caleb Walker and Cody Walker will have to portray Paul Walker’s legendary beloved character Brian O’Connor in FX!

i see they didnt say to justin lin how physics work

Cypher’s submarine may be strong, but not as strong as family

That mad Scientist laughter HAHAHAHA

That scene was too much

&#39;&#39; Get us out of here!!!&#39;&#39;&#39;Why are you always yelling?!&#39;I am dying :D

cbbhk

This is for my son <a href="">2:20</a>

Submarine be doing 60 in 2.5 seconds 😏😏

It&#39;s confirmed.. Ice charger has about 75000hp and dom&#39;s jacket is heat proof

Yea the cars wouldnt of stopped the heat hed of been burned alive from his lungs.

I think dom deservse this

<a href="">3:08</a> family

<a href="">1:25</a> - Love how her mental state shatters when she finally met her worthy opponent

Thanks to Dom&#39;s physics knowledge he saved his family

Is it just me, or is that submarine unrealistically fast? I thought subs could only get up to 56 km&#39;s an hour. Did they strap a rocket to this thing?

I love fast and furious all 8 of them I haven&#39;t seen the 9 yet but I bet it will be amazing, and I love that all he thinks is about family, I love my family too, and I totally get why he says he&#39;s got family ❤, I&#39;ve got family too😊😉😃😄😁😉😊👍👍

Positivity Moving Forward

Don’t interfere or interrupt me Ever

I’m No SLAVE
Positivity Moving Forward

That’s My girl😌✅❤️‍🔥🤴🏾✊🏾
This is still more believable then F9

FAMILY

Pretty dure Dom would have been burned alive.

Kosatka griefer

Fire is strong, but family is stronger 😂😂 <a href="">3:12</a>

Laws of physics are applied throughout the movie

The fact it takes 2 previous antagonist from the movies before Fate of the Furious to take on Cipher. That&#39;s like Madara and Obito Uchiha trying to take out Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. Or side quest bosses taking out the main quest final boss.You get my point.

Letty’s signature word:DOM

Remember when they used to steal dvd players and tv, work at their resto bar at morning and race in the evening? Good times.

not a single vehicle can outrun a 7,500 mph missile.

The family vs Avengers in a fight, who do you think will win??

Why have physics when you can have family?

<a href="">0:07</a>

Last scene is cool

Ok, but Dom’s comeback was solid.

The level of ridiculous is astounding!

This is laughable 😂😂

<a href="">0:42</a> When you remind yourself that those caracters were stealling old TVs with neon cars in Fast and Furious 1.

I&#39;m pretty sure a heatseeker travels faster than 120mph lolTry Mach 3/Mach 4Among countless other things.

This is so ridiculous and I love it!

Thanos : I got an entire army Avengers : we got a hulk Dom : I got family Avengers and thanos: woah woah (ran away)

Still hard to watch Fast and Furious series without Paul 😢

Who needs heat seeking missiles when you have family?

FAMILY!

It amazing how they have better traction ok ice than they would on asphalt

This movie brings back memories from when I was young and watching Cartoons. It&#39;s stupid but fun to watch

Guys y&#39;all should stop complaining about physics and logic and stuff at this point and just have fun like me🤣🤣

Family gets me here

All started because Brian decided not to go to Fat Burgers.

Also fun fact all misses on warships have a minimum safe launching distance of about 8km at least for American subs. So yea the safety systems on board wouldn’t let her fire unless she knew how to disable them

This is why I love street racing. I love escaping from missiles and torpedoes it really gets your adrenaline flowing!!

I said two times I think this movie is dumb and welp this is more stupid then the last clips

He was about to go Barry Allen and faze through the blast, good thing his family got his back.

<a href="">2:04</a> the missile knows where it is because it knows where it isn&#39;t

Rip torettos car
Whos here because of that fckin &quot;family&quot; meme of Dom everywhere on facebook. 😂

Remember when this movie is about drag racing

From fighting for a 10sec car to stoping a nuc war

good thing fire cant go under cars

The Cheese 🧀 factor is huge in these movie&#39;s.

&#39;&#39;Why are you always yelling?&#39;&#39;

Movies are to entertain.....not to follow physics.... IDK why everybody is in physics!!???DOM is inevitable...

<a href="">1:04</a> I&#39;m sorry but this is hilariously cringey

I dont care what some people say about these movies i still like n love them especially the action n hypeness in the movie n it kinda got u goosebumps too  but i do noticed that dom always crash his muscle car in every movie since the first one n it always be rebuild in each sequel i guess that&#39;s his trademark in the movie he crashed his car n saves the day like always n they go home n party n have a beer too lol😂😎 i guess dom is the optimus prime of the fast n furious movies lol🙏💖😂😎😍😎😎😎😎😎

The real casualties in this series are:Physics and brain cells.Rest in peace!

what is faster? a missile flying at supersonic speeds or a car going 80-100 mph

<a href="">1:03</a> Cypher got incinerated with that comeback line!

&quot;Illogic&quot;.That&#39;s the term I think we should coin for the driving force behind this, the torpedo scene, the harpoon scene, and even scenes from other movies, like the final sequence in Tai Lung&#39;s escape, because that&#39;s what those scenes are: Illogical.

I don&#39;t understand...How did the ice not break in such heat and fire???

<a href="">3:10</a> i hear a voice in my head who&#39;s singing the power rangers song....you know, &quot;go go power rangeeeers 🎶&quot;

Need friends like them <a href="">3:10</a>

dom’s face is always   \   /   o  o   <i>__</i>

Physicans:🥸💥
Even physics was scared of Dom Toretto

Even if the cars didn&#39;t show up he probably would&#39;ve survived still.

It&#39;s 2021, and Dom outruns a mach 4 missile fired from a launcher that doesn&#39;t even exist on submarines. We are all too jaded to be confused

I just want to note, the way IR guided missiles (heat seekers) work is they track heat off of any target,  they weren’t putting off enough heat for it to have a lock, not to mention when dim dodged the missiles which wouldn’t happen, they would immediately lose tracking and fly straight, then they also track by where the target will be, not where it is, then those missiles pull ridiculously g’s the Russian r60 could pull 30g’s the aim9 m could pull 50g’s then those missiles move over Mach 2.5 and that’s being generous so by all standards, dim should be dead but there’s some avionic science for you there

I got goosebumps after seeing this clip 😳

I don&#39;t now why doms car in fast and furious 8  the fate off the furious

fun fact : Dom&#39;s car is made of Vibranium

I need a full set of those ice tires are they BS Goodrich?

What I don&#39;t get is why they didn&#39;t turn left or right I know they were heading forward to that gate thing but they still could have drove to the left or right side of the sub so it can&#39;t hit some of them

So dodgy
<a href="">2:01</a> wait missile can&#39;t do a full turn, can it?

Guys in the submarine:C R I S P Y

Master Chief-&quot;I&#39;m giving the covenant back their bomb!&quot;

And they say Bollywood movies are without any concept of physics.

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Fgxyfusdzf sc jji fgxyfusdzf xxwecxzzr
Soooo the whole sub with the nukes explode and somehow the nukes didn’t blow up?😂

The Fast And The Furious: <b>Street racers</b>Fate of The Furious: <b>Avengers Level Threat</b>

Meanwhile Heat seeker missile: m I joke to you boy...? You can&#39;t beat my speed bro.... 2 to 3 mach speed

no way a submarine can go that fast

Family

Ppl keep talking about physics physics physics I&#39;m like who GAF just stfu and enjoy the movie from an action pack standpoint 😂

the fire didn’t melt the ice? HOW

<a href="">0:41</a> That laugh will never not get to me, look at the goddamn expression on her face. Letty was SO expecting not to walk from that lmao

Slowest missile ever
Everyone say heatseeker a few more times so the audience knows whats up

<a href="">3:12</a> ah yes because they can all just  come to a complete stop on ice after driving a high speeds with no one sliding into each other and the fire miraculously doesn’t touch Dom after it engulfing the cars lol

What a beautiful ending to this scene 🥺🥰👍
If physics ever decides to make a cameo in one of these movies,dom and fam would be dead fast And furious :)

Yeah right...
So silly 😂😂 but badass

Natural disasters: known to wreak havoc and reap destruction upon everything that hinders it’s path.Dom: FamilyNatural Disasters: Aight Imma head out

Come in the side of the city my stuff and it’s not going to rock bottom in Kratos Hunan without a single cool cool cool cool cool superhero but it does take a check to Sun

Don’t listen to them a couple years you so that you could tomorrow because she really lets why do you feel scared of it I’m at the go to say

CREDITS: The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious.ME: Nah, really?

Don&#39;t take these movies so seriously and complain about the reality of everything wrong with them, It&#39;s like the Michael Bay Transformers movies If you ignore the story and disregard everything involving realism or any kind of intelligence they&#39;re kind of fun to watch so if it makes you feel better consider them a guilty pleasure.

You need a maximum IQ of 60 to enjoy this

Its been 4 years, Who still watching this video?

Fascinated by how the fire didn&#39;t get through the bottom space of the cars.

How come all cars have traction on ice?
Remember when letty was riding a Nissan 240sx and drag racing

What is it with Dom and fire?

Wait..... KOSATSKA FROM GTA ONLINE CAME FROM THIS?
Charlize Theron should do more villain roles.

Say what you must, but Dom&#39;s mustang is goregous.

Cypher is having a paddy

Please tell me there&#39;s nothing to worry about.We got this.

<b>Physics has left the chat</b>

The fate of the furious is the antidote to the scientists &#39; question : &quot;why is there religion&quot;?!

It looks like physics, chemistry,botany, zoology &amp; every other known sciences took sick leave during the filming of this franchise.

Me when physics is absent.

Awe that&#39;s my girl

At the end we all should agree to one word - &quot;Family&quot;

GTA 5 missions be like

Y then lambo tho

Hobbs: why are u always screaming                Roman: COUSE IM SCARED

Yuyun milk 👙
those movie maker doesn&#39;t know that submarine speed and car speed is not same

Dom’s girl: That’s not good!Me: No dip Sherlock

Hobbs to Roman why are u always yelling 😂😂

So a submarine can move at over 100 mph while breaking the ice? And a submarine has heatseekers? Also a car moves faster than a missile?Remember, all this AFTER we have disregarded physics.

The movies changed when the rock came

Submarines don’t run that fast

<a href="">1:21</a> “Put a heat seeker on him now.......NOW!!!” Cipher’s villainous breakdown

How wonderful the special effects are!
Without Paul walker the movie is faded

Wowww

That ice got better traction that most expressways.

I don&#39;t know who is harder to kill between Dom and Thanos

What movie did these guys make?
“I don’t have physics, I have family”

You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon!

dom name is like a pizza

Anything&#39;s possible when family                                      -dom

I love how the entire comment section is just making fun of the movie lol.

I think anyone in the bow and stern may have survived, albeit with minor burns

I cannot emphasise how goddamn slow that missile is. I simply cannot.

.

<a href="">1:45</a> What&#39;s the name of this particular soundtrack?

Your stupid everyone they cover him when they don’t no him

They should’ve just got some boost and aerieled away

I don&#39;t thnk that&#39;s how heat seeking missals, explosions, cars, and fire works... but you go girl.

Soooo. Apparently submarines can go 100mph while breaking through ice lmao. And a heat seeking missile can’t go as fast as a muscle car driving through snow and ice hahaha.Submarines can go only 20mph give or take.....and that’s not through ice.Heat seeking missiles go about 1,500 mph. And let’s say Dom is driving about 100mph in the snow ( I’m being nice).Like come on, fast and furious 1 and 2 were the only good movies. Now it’s just cheesy unrealistic action scenes.

Man got toasted like armin from attk on titan

Crossed the extreme level of Action

<b>physics has left the chat</b>

Dom: starts drivingCar: <b>chuckles</b> I&#39;m in danger
Never knew all you need to save the world was some Cali street racers... I wanna meet the people who write these films...

I like doms ice charger
I kinda feel sorry for Dom...... He keeps getting his car destroyed and has to buy a new one......

Bruh, even the fastest submarine in the world can’t go faster than 60 mph

<b>Physics exist</b>Movie:and I took that personally

Now that i watch this again yhe way they deafen out the car sounds only when they talk makes their dialogues sound so broken and awkward

Incomplete without O’ Coner ride in heaven paul love you always and forever

Did they use a remodel of the kursk. Cuz those propellors look very similar

<a href="">0:05</a> why are you always yelling

Not gonna lie, my manchild brain really like this action.

&quot;Thats a god damn Heatseeker coming at us!&quot;....and you worked that out how?

tbf the fireball didn&#39;t touch him so he would only be half cooked

So uh......DVD players?
In 3 minutes this movie said fu€k you to all laws of physics

It was nice when Dom&#39;s team drove to save him when the sub exploded

Good

<a href="">0:07</a>

Why do they try to keep out running it lol? I mean, they could literally just go left or right and escape it.

Dominic Toretto will return in Avengers Endgame

<a href="">2:02</a> the missiles turn better than F22 and fly really slow<b>physics has left the chat</b>

So cars can deflect fire, well done

I like how Cipher&#39;s crew are willing to cause a nuclear war but are all hesitant to launch a heat seeking missile on Dom lol

Always The Family Is Behind You

That&#39;s my girl😎

After seeing Hobbs and Shaw the fast and furious franchise is now considered sci fi

does anyone else come close to tears when he blows up or destroys these beautiful cars!

bro imagine of albert einstein was still alive he would end his life after seeing these physics

Who needs physics when you have family?

Paul wants Tyrence Cheated on with 14,000 people beacuse Tyrence had oral.

Vin and Michelle want Paul cheated with 14,000 people.

WHY ARE U ALWAYS YELLING

&amp; my dear guys this is where science left the Earth to be take care by bald men who never die

And that&#39;s what&#39;s up

We will establish a council of those equipped with devices. We will find our father. He lived for a period of time as a male, and his origins are female. His home is from her brain. We must take him to a brain that he had before, in which there are two moons. He is concealed in a new female and has a sun. I exist in the sun. I am also a brain and I will be extinguished for a period of time, remember, and I will return to my femininity, but the most important thing is It is confronting him, saying that I was a female before. He does not feminize me as a new female or kill me except me by returning to the place of my organs. Imagine his birth in the place from which we are born and controlling it and transporting us to another place. We are carried under the skins of animals and we are born from close to them. Even the submarine is in possession of weapons. She is very powerful and has committed a crime. The ejaculation and birth of a brain took place instead of the birth of a child, and it captured the place of the one it descended and took a planet, whether it was a sun, or many other things. Equality is feminine on the day a sun returns, and when it descends at the beginning, it denies the birth of the male of God, but there are those who use its remembrance against all of us males. This time, I was a female, and I was descended and born as I. Ali Ahmed Hassan is a male. He depends on me for his intercourse with the male who was born in the days of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and who returned during this period, whether the brain was from a female and then transferred to an animal female. We must implement in Muhammad the return to the birth of a female, take away the brain from his new source and return it to the brain he had before in days. Islam has revealed a plane. Is it the first plane you have ever seen that is pure? Cry alone and with your presence. Learn how an ancient man was punished and preceded him to his normality. The male king. God is a brain that rips and desires as females desire, and it is his place in his planet. The Aviation Administration has kept secret the ownership of a plane. It has appeared today. The plane is mine and my female. Mixed in
That’s family man

Yes, ya Allah.
Kind of hard to keep the anger in, now she registered on an emotional level and lost.

Even the MCU is more realistic than this

The best climax

(Starts driving), that’s not good, (looks back...) THATS NOT GOOD!

It still blows my mind how no cgi was used

I love how that just keep grabbing a higher gear 😂

I think my IQ has just dropped by 40 points.

<a href="">2:17</a> Dom,This,Gets Ciphers attention,Dom,This is for my son.<a href="">2:20</a> Dom Puts car in Gear and game over!!!

Roman Sounds like kev heart
Madmax on ice.

Went from street racing to Michael Bay 😎😂

I&#39;m so glad those flames didn&#39;t go underneath the cars and still burn him alive😁😒😞

After fast 5 the films became irrelevant

That’s what I call a team

All this over a Tuna Sandwich

that end was fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Audience : how did he dodge that heat seeker on the hill Dom: with family

and that, is how Dom lost his hair(i know he&#39;s already bald dont ruin it)

The best scene that i ever seen

At this rate the final fast and furious will be the decepticon killing one of doms family member and now doms out for revenge and has to partner up with the autobots. But wait while fiighting the decepticons they come across a godzilla which destroys optimus prime and so megatron decides to team up with dom to kill the godzilla in revenge for killing his rival.

FF1: Racing carsFF8: Superman

All the fast saga movies are great but furious 7 has a special place in our hearts.

I really want to watch this movie

Why didn&#39;t they just turn away from the sub lol

Only thing that makes sense is that nothing makes sense

Me:Pretty sure the fire would have just burned through the car and still kill Dom...Dom: This ain&#39;t gonna kill me.I got family.Me: He&#39;s got family.

MATHEUS

Just realized something. Dom flips at the end of almost every movie

I didnt know that Submarines can go 150-200kmh fast

They turned all the main characters into captain america super soldiers.

they really dont write scripts for these things, they just write one liners over and over

i have a question, why tf they tryna outrun the sub (witch in fact must be slow asf) They could just go sideways and escape it.

I swear to god, can dom never keep his dodge in one piece for like the whole movie (ok this doesn&#39;t make much sense but oh well)

Toerrto Dom vs Missles Strikes

Why they always run from the enemy in a straight line just pull away

Roman: GET US OUT OF HEREHobbs: WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS TELLING?
that white wrx ooohh myyy

As unreal as this is I love it

i am selling the crashed car, still works fine

dhoni bihari
me watching this scene: &quot;Just steer left or right, away from that submarine!&quot; xD

Vin and Michelle look great

i wanna start a petition to end this franchise. they need to go back to their roots

Tom should have jump on the righter side so his car doesn’t explode

Dom and Letty look great together

Seriously, in almost every Fast and Furious Movie that had Vin Diesel, he was always the Alpha Male, even more so than Hobbs and Shaw. Everyone heeded his command even Hobbs, and only he could pull a stunt like that...

We the. Fight me ferfectly

Can you eat shit?
Only cockroaches and Dom can survive a nuclear explosion.

!o

This scene is incredible. I love how Dom went on the crew&#39;s side.

Hgfvb

Get us out of here! Rock: why are you always yelling?! Him again: what else am I suppose to say?!?!?!

When family is important than physics

I like it fast and strong through hell 6😁😄🏎
Letse waitttt for da fast and furious 9

so sad to see dominic’s car blow up beside him.

Raging at a game <a href="">1:20</a>

The thumbnail looks like a movie from 2001 or 1999

that isnt just a team its a family as dom says

Wat is the character of dom.. is he s hero or villain or thief or a business man os wat he destroys cars worth crores...

what the hell is this

Fast and furious was so much better, when they kept it real. All this CGI has ruined the franchise in my eyes.

Truthfully how they all came back to cover him brought me to tears because that’s what love looks like

<a href="">0:48</a> In this position, they gonna form a megazord.

<a href="">1:02</a>c

<a href="">1:40</a> dog: help my please

&quot; Get us out of here &quot;&quot; Why are you always yelling? &quot;.

First movie: Stop DVD trucks thiefsEight movie: Stop nuclear warAnd you know what, I still love it

Oh my gosh that is frozen was cool

to the end it was so Epic

<a href="">0:03</a>When I realise that somebody hit our field trip school bus

Shameless

<a href="">0:27</a> I'm tired of loyalty;
Me : Haha thats so unrealistic...Fast saga : we will go to space.Me : HMM.

<a href="">2:50</a> aight imma head out

Bollywood: What are you talking about.. this is perfectly realistic

&quot;I destroyed two of your teams, I killed your red headed boyfriend and put two killers on your untraceable plane you lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon&quot; 😂😂😂😂

&quot; I killed your red head boyfriend. &quot; I like this word.

Don&#39;t heat seekers travel over 1,000 miles per hr

how cool
Remember when ff wasnt about riding supercars to the moon and saving the galaxy.

this is not Dom, this is Riddick driving a muscle car and saving the universes!

Why are you always yelling

On this episode of Power Rangers Turbo

You cant block fire...
<a href="">2:27</a>

We needed a Supra

Fast 15: Riding on saturn rings and the crew dragging a moon each on their back. And of course, dom pulls the titan..<b>as a family</b>

Nice

WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING!🤬🤬🤬
wat teo po i toyototototaoaoa supppbruh
The answer to every situation is NO2 &amp; Dominic Torreto

<a href="">1:04</a> when you got maphack and almost win then you got your karma back.

So Fast and Furious series turned into a super heroes franchise?

It seemed so plausible

Fast9000: Letty: DOM!!!!Dom: Family. (Drives through Goku&#39;s Kamehame.)Fast 1 million: Letty: DOM!!!!!!!Dom: Family. (Smashes car into The Living Tribunal.)Fast 8 billion and 4:Letty: DOM!!!!!!!!!Dom: Family. (Drives car into Overvoid.)Fast 10 trillion:Letty: DOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!Dom: Family. (Kamikaze&#39;s car through the mutiverse of all fiction.) .......................................................................-----&gt;He survives this.

<a href="">3:22</a> ah yes. because everyone knows fire can&#39;t go UNDER cars. genius

Dom can survive anything

That was cool when you were on the ice Fate of the furious😎

Keep in mind a truck driver with a shotgun effected them more

What kind of sub has heat seeking anti air missiles? Those thing can go super sonic too so he should be dead.

<a href="">0:07</a> Y R U ALWAYS YELLING

Everybody talking abt Laws of physics, well they clearly have the lord of fire on their side

good nachos, baby! crazy guys 4ever!
<a href="">0:07</a> Why are you always yelling

That&#39;s the tightest scene wen all 5 cars sworve around Dom to keep him from getting burned

Next title should be.. FF to the moon

how much fuel does that fox 3 have bro omg

😂 no comments.
Now THAT is what a family is 😌😎

I am pretty sure that heat seaker can travel at a minimum speed of 760 mph.

that not good that not good

the screenwriters must have been drinking too much grey goose to think a heavily armored charger  can outpace a missle 😂😂😂

Upload part 8 fast furious

Movie superb 🙏🙏🙏👀
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Should have just stopped at fast and the furious.

people always complain about the physics in fast and furious movies...  but serious though... have you guys watch any bollywood movies... compared to this... this is realistic... okay not really but... comparibly... it is...

The voice acting on some of the characters is awful

The VFX THO 🤢
i guess they were usin cuban fire

I&#39;ll have to put this scene right behind Indiana Jone&#39;s refrigirator.

“Why are you always yelling” Me when my mom says am in my phone to much

From street races to saving the world ..Next Up: Fast n the Furious Infinity War.

I could say this is the biggest piece of bull I’ve ever seen in a movie but the I saw the trailer for fast 9

<a href="">1:34</a> playing gta 5 public session be like

Physics left the chat

Is that Akula class nuclearsubmarine or what?

Welcome to Xander Zone!!!!Ups wrong franchise

Can anyone actually die?

So you’re telling me the only car that was modified to jump just so happens to be the only one that needed it

Apparently the fire didnt melt the ice they were on

When you buy Avengers on Wish:

The only thing that i truly loved about this movie, was the tribute to Xander Cage. With the camera angle.

foda

Physics declined chat invitation.

Now close u mouth 😂

Why are you always yelling at me

They all saved Dom. LIKE A FAMILY

Thats not how fire works

Im kinda confused on how the team could hear dom when he told them to peel off.....😕😶

&#39;&#39;Why are you always yelling?!&#39;&#39;me:SO THAT THIS VEHICLE DONT GET FLIPPED OVER AND GETS FLATTENED AND WE DIE

Put a heat seeker on him now.NOOOW!!!!!

Physicists must hate this franchise

You say she is crazy but that laugh is crazy

Issac Newton didn’t die for this 😔

Not finna lie da ending da dope tho
so none of that fire went under their cars?

Is this new terminator movie

That’s just silly

Why Newton why you even have that apple stuck over your head.See this is happening :p

&quot;Get us out of here!&quot;&quot;Why are you always yelling?”

<a href="">0:07</a> Roman Get Us out of here Hobs Why are u always yelling?!?!? 😂😂😂😂😂

even on ice Dom can get the front tires off the ground. This guy should be setting up suspensions for a living.

That bald head sure can take heat

Didn’t know flames are resistant to bald heads

Generally this movie didn&#39;t have the physics most warned but let&#39;s be honest it probably isn&#39;t going to come back so complaining about the movie isn&#39;t going to do anything surely I mean I miss the old movies too but I guess at this point all we can do is accept the movies we are given or don&#39;t watch them at all that&#39;s just my opinion upon this change in the movies

Me:playing games*Mom:Clean your room,we have guests coming.Me:still playing*Mom: <a href="">1:25</a>

Its funny how many times Dom is going to risk his life and Letty is always yelling  DOM

The likeliness of this happening is on the odds of looking into a cell culture and seeing a thousand dancing hamsters.

it crazy how irl people can go 2 mph and tag a tree and die but THIS MAN CAR WAS ON FIRE, BEING SHOT AT, AND ROLLING OVER THE GROUND AT MACH 600. TF?

Wow that explosion was so hot it burned off all of Dom&#39;s hair.

I don&#39;t think modern day Heat sekkers can detect heat from the car

the fast an furiouse films are the definition of more money than sense

So Dom can drive faster than a missile and can also dodge it plus his team can also drive faster than an explosion plus he can take the heat, man people should take notes from this movie

<a href="">0:01</a> that&#39;s your parents&#39; noise when they are playing leapfrog without you

Why are you always yelling!

Submarine running at 200🤣
Dom = Iron Man
Rich people
what if dom didnt tell cipher what he did?

He didn&#39;t die
It’s because Dom is lucky and when the fire he knows what to do

yeah thank you justin lin for fucki g the franchise up

Gets in last gear while running from a bad guy automatically gets new gear

So Dom&#39;s car blows up but none of theirs....aight then

f7 was the end of the series. nothing can change my mind

FF10 crew in talk with elon musk for space shuttle..

I thought the heat seeker was a sperm whale

Paul would have  just exploded his Supra at the point

Person I&#39;m riding with,&quot;that&#39;s not good.Me: well obviously, what is this supposed to be funny?

When everybody&#39;s talking about Physics, here I am appreciating the costs they threw out for that orange lambo!! And oh, all of the high end cars which were zombiefied at the beginning. At this point, which everything&#39;s unbelievable already, you gotta look something you&#39;ll atleast appreciate at, yeah?

I&#39;m pretty positive the director of this movie failed physics in school.

Man when they shielded him was awesome! Dam I remember when I had friends a looooooong time ago!!

Remember when FnF was all about street racing and not explosion

If this was in real life none of them wouldn&#39;t have survived

Family Physics!!

Fast 8 is a recycled version of Fast 6

They never refuel throught the hoel movie. That is for all the fast and furious movies.

The fact that it shows them racing all day every day but I ain&#39;t see nobody refuel.

You just entered the Zander zone. Ops wrong movie

Yogi adityanath is an excellent actor

It was 4 cars covering dom

Nice

Scifi

They have some really special tires to get that much traction on ice

Every time I see Dodge Charger (no matter the year model) in a TV or Movies, IT ALWAYS GET DESTROYED!

Can they just turn left?

Roman: GET US OUT OF HERE!Rock: why are you always yelling!

&quot;Why are you always yelling?&quot;

As a physics student, I can say it is possible to do this, but highly unlikely. The only point highly unfeasable, was not getting blown up when the nuclear sub exploded.

This is actually mad

The guy: GET US OUT OF HERE!! The other guy: WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING

what the hell no😮😮😨
Get us out of here! Why are you all ways yelling?!

Lemme guess - next time they blow up the moon

These movies just get steadily more stupid

Laws of physics where you at??

Good to see the Fast and Furious franchise add a little realism into their films

Rip  Paul

ice charger is cool

I want this on TV
Speed:Heatseeker missile =dom&#39;s carFine, maybe dom has 5000hp Other cars =the submarineIf they drive 120mph the submarine could chase after them, so is like.....104knotsAnyone knows how much speed for the fastest submarine on earth?

Is dom a jedi?
<a href="">2:14</a>

Physics in a Star Wars movie make more sense than this.

it all started with tuna sandwiches

Dom 👍👍👍👍👍
i really hate this movie i know its about fantasy and drama but i mean theres gotta be some groundednes

That’s a TEAM though!! Lmao

<a href="">0:25</a> when you wake up and look the time is 07:25am

I love how with FF movies, the film makers can rely on your brain giving up in first 2 minutes so they can bring us this.

He literally  falled in fire and survived...

How tf them cars gonna block that heat explosion? It can go under them mfs I swear FaF died...

Damn I forgot how kickass these movies are

<a href="">0:40</a> FF series react when asked about physics

Y’all this movie is for fun and excitement physics don’t need a play unless it’s super entertaining

I don’t think that’s how fire works

<a href="">2:17</a> - This Is From My Son!

Thats my girl😍😍😍
<b>Physics has left the chat</b>

you rote false fate it&#39;s fast

This movie always defeated my expectations.

Letty: that&#39;s not good! Also letty: <b>THATS NOT GOOD!!</b>

Thats not how fire works tho

80% of the comments are : &quot;Remember when the movie was about street racing....&quot; The rest are about how the movie defies laws of Physics,yet millions of people still watch these movies and FF still makes hundreds of millions of dollars

Hats off to this scene

That’s My Girl❤️
Like car work
Best cast and awesome stunts

Could he have emp’d the missile or should I just stick to my video games?

They must have super hero tires that don&#39;t skid on ice

Who think you say run will make the clip better? &gt;:3

I swear I hear letty screaming “DOM” in every fast and furious movie

I guess their lost without Paul walker.

<a href="">0:41</a> XDDD

How are you, my friends and loved ones? I opened a channel on YouTube called Fares Abu Saud Alaw, and I hope everyone subscribes to it. May God make you happy and protect you, my dears. I love you.
&quot;This is my son&quot;

“That’s not good!” Well thanks captain obvious -_-

Oh, what is the concept of beating...
How to survive an explosion Uhh...Simple just hide behind the cars you won&#39;t even get a scratch

What do you want to see my father?
Ooo i see meh boi wi an sti

Scientists: Where&#39;s the physics?Dom: I ain&#39;t got physics. I got family.

2

I don&#39;t know who&#39;s got the stronger plot armor, Batman or Dom?

Physics never entered the chat.

america found answer to russian hypersonic missiles, Dom&#39;s car.

Dom is invincible because his cheat code is *family 🤣

Dom barely survives train hit. But completely survived car flip , jumping from high buildings , heat stroke and not a broken bone or burnt skin.

Dam remember when dom dislocated his arm flipping in the charger race. Apparently he’s become bionic man and can jump out of a flipping car and not have a single scratch

The Incredibles that’s my girl fate of the furious that’s my girl

what saved dom from the explosion? FAMILY!!!! also the fire not going under the car and getting dom. I love how they know how ridiculous these movies are and embraced it by ditching realism

Dom keeps killing muscle cars.

How&#39;s their cars driving on snow / ice at high speed ?

<a href="">1:27</a>The heat seeker should have just flown down from Cipher&#39;s plane and not the submarine.

Dom can do anything with 1 car

Kayal

Can someone tell me how many times letty shouted &quot;dom!&quot;

Dom done with all racers. Now racing a missile WTF

Even mach 4 missile can&#39;t win race against Dom

Did anyone else get M.A.S.K. vibes fr this scene with the submarine? The only thing they are lacking at this point are weapons mounted on their cars.

Fake epic scene that still gives goosebumps

<a href="">1:25</a>

Dom: I HAVE AN IDEAPhysics was kicked from the gameAudience: surprised pikachu face

THIS MOVIE IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL 🤯
I never seen such bs in my life

They protecc dom with their cars

<a href="">3:08</a> this is so unrealistic, instead of having those cars cover dom, they should&#39;ve just let his elbow deflect the flame, would&#39;ve been more believable

But not in English
I see all these people bitchin about physics yet they still watch the sequals why is that?

And that was how every single one of them died

“Put a heater seeker on him now, Now !!!!”

thomas had never seen such bullshit before

Ni

Not to be that guy but like , wouldnt some country’s military/government be seeing all this n call to action??

That&#39;s not how fire works honey

THE COUNTERS DEADDDDDD

Dumb is like the terminator of fast and furious

Roman: <b>GET US OUT OF HERE!!!</b>Hobbs: <b>WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING?!?!?!</b>
I love when Dom says that&#39;s my girl and smiles.

Cool

Who needs the Avengers, when we got Dom 😂

Stupid movie🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
DAMNNNNNNNNNÑNNNNNNNNNN
I love Dom and Letty so much. It makes me laugh every time Roman says GET US OUT OF HERE and then Hobbs says WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don&#39;t remember when the last time submarines are packed with heat seeking missile

Lol,&quot; that&#39;s my girl

“Heat sensor on my pickle” - ski mask

That&#39;s the most awesomest  save I have ever seen all the cars circle around domanic protecting him from the explosion

I love to see the reaction of my science teacher after watching this clip

Did he have a son?

Dom yells This is my son

Gotta love Letty😭💯
That&#39;s teaches us team work to get  successful in life

The best!

<a href="">0:06</a> Why are you always yelling?!<a href="">0:13</a> Ya think, Letty?<a href="">3:08</a> Now, that&#39;s how a family does it, not like how those meme people view them all the time.

Let's get a lot of likes so Americans think something is cool
Lol 🤣🤣
Fast and furious 50: John Wick vs dom vs Batman vs hitman

You know I generally liked this movie I had no problem with it and then this scene happened.

First the team faced a tank and then a submarine, what&#39;s next an army of monster trucks?

The kid from incredible: That’s was totally wicked ‼️‼️‼️

<a href="">1:37</a>

The rock:why are you always yelling Me:*ears pop*

So ridiculous...🙄🙄🙄
I can hear this video even though its muted

physics: ight imma head out

Remember when the movie was about street racing and fast cars. Now we watching call of duty with tanks and submarines

Am i the only one who liked when the gang used their cars to block raidiation to save dom? Just me? Ok

<a href="">3:02</a>

I want to be like rook

This franchise must&#39;ve ended when they &#39;stole&#39; 100M dollars.

Well the viewing population has officially lost IQ points watching this.

Sore

of course, they&#39;d all get radiation poising after that

That’s not how physics works

<a href="">2:39</a>

<a href="">2:17</a>

Ramsey the curly hair women is cute af😍

No one messes with this badass ice charger!!!

This scene&#39;s very cool!!!!!

THIS... THIS IS FOR MY SON

How does fire work?Not like that

Mom    : Clean your room, it&#39;s soo messyMe        : -_-3 second laterMom    : <a href="">1:25</a>

It's a shame about this boat. Tu probably likes it.
Why they didn&#39;t they took left or right turn?

Love action scene, but this was fantasy beyond fantasy. No american  soldier attack or destroy  a russian base till today.  Even still haven&#39;t a  submarine which  missile launchers  works on that way.  Last mistake if were armed with a nuclear warhead. When did pow was game over.

<a href="">0:08</a>

<a href="">0:07</a>

Anyone else notice that the description says &quot;sends a heat SINKING missile&quot;? One could spend a whole career just pointing out all the ways this is ridiculous.

<a href="">1:25</a>  NOOOWWWWW!!!

that’s my girl.

Dom have 8 life he never dies

Anybody gonna go left or right

Doms car top speed in this scene. Less than 150 mph. Heat seeker average speed: 7500 mph. Yet dom can outrun it?

Dom gone evil?
It's the greatest movie in the world on the move
Why are you always yelling

Fast and Furious 1 - 4: Grounded Street racingFast and Furious 5 - 7: Superhero moviesFast and Furious 8: Sharknado

nice team work

&#39;That&#39;s a god damn heat seeker coming on us&quot;

That&#39;s not how fire works broken sin counter dings random Shi t

Wonderful
Dom= hero /leader...always
Teamwork makes the dreamwork

The last bit was too over the top .. dont know why they had to spoil it

He&#39;s be f ing dead.
Avengers !!!!!
Wish i&#39;m a dope driver like Letty
Just enjoy the action scene logic seeking dumbassesIf you used that logic in your life, you wouldn&#39;t be here commenting on movie&#39;s logics

I dont know

It&#39;s not ridiculous, but it&#39;s still successful.

Why are you always yelling Dj Khalid: Im Dj KhALiD wHy Am I yElLiNg

<a href="">3:08</a> I love how he puts up his arm as if it will shield him from the explosion 🤣

That&#39;s a new one... Cars with countermeasures

FAST FURIOUS BITE VIN DIESEL BROTHER RÉMI GOFFLO 😆
And just when you think it can&#39;t get any more over the top....

<a href="">0:47</a> “that’s my girl” are you kidding me you dom in the movie literally kissed the girl that you were working with....

Alright I know how everyone is like “ how did this go from street racing and realistic crime, to this? “ but if you were the writers, where would you go with this? I’m curious to see

Goddamn ruiner 2000  missiles

nice

nice

hi

Remember when these movies were about STREET RACING, and not explosions?! How is this still a &quot;Thing?&quot;

<a href="">3:10</a> what about under the cars?  There&#39;s clearly space for the fire to go under 😂😂

I only saw the first film, 20 years ago....Weren&#39;t these all backstreet thugs racing each other on modified hot rods?  What are they doing with international espionage??

Red Yakju
Thankfully, the laws of physics were all taken into account, carefully examined and respected throughout this entire movie

<a href="">0:14</a>Letty: This b***h is crazy!Me: I agree

Imagine if one of them got there a few seconds late and couldn’t see because of the fire and nailed dom and sent him flying like 50 feet..At least he is safe from the fire :)

They went from racing to shootin

Haha surprise bi#@*!!
So turning left or right doesnt exist in this scene

They got that damn missile from the same store they bought the missiles from Behind Enemy Lines ....

Moot ky plays
All because of a tuna sandwich

Indonesian people like it
How many can happen to dom

Can I just get my tuna sandwich??

One of the best movie...

Anyone realize that Mia is gone?😂

<a href="">0:42</a> Letty laughs hysterically after not dying 😂😂😂Michelle’s awesome

Thanos will appear in fast 9 confirmed

Good film. <a href="">3:09</a> these are friends

<a href="">0:46</a> what every girl wants

years from now someone will ask us &quot;what is the greatest scene they ever made for a movie?&quot; and we will all say &quot;the scene where vin deisel races with a missile and says &quot;this one is for my son&quot; before blowing up an entire submarine&quot;

Every new Fast and furious movie be likeOne last rideOne last rideOne last rideOne last ride One last ride

Excuse me but since when does Submarines have a small heat seaking missle on it?Hmmmmmmmmm

Let’s be honest as dumb as that fire shield looked it felt epic and sent chills up my spine.

fast and furious is the new avengers

Thes is my girl

<a href="">0:41</a> lettys laugh 😂 keep clicking

That&#39;s the team what everyone wants...

Yahhhh woooo street racing

So I was talking to the screen and said how about we aim at the Sub Instead Of Letty,Ramsey,Hobbs,Little Nobody,Tej,Roman And Dom Please They can’t die

<a href="">0:36</a>  I want a Girlfriend like her.

Why has this franchise gone from street racing and evading police to tanks and stopping nuclear wars with the good guys?

Lmao

<a href="">1:57</a> those hills came out of nowere

“That’s not good!” 😅😂😂

Can you write????
Death quick alate
Fast 10 is going to be about Dom&#39;s group working as security guards to prevent muggings in front of a kwik mart. Because the movies cant get any more stupid, so the directors will just go so far in the opposite direction so to surprise everyone.

Dimas Kurnia Rido Kurnia Yunan
Dom acts to good tbh Paul would of done better if he were here

Black Guy: Get us outta here!The Rock: Why are you always yelling!Black Guy: I have a speech disorder!

It’s just not the same without BRIAN

Lol why you always yelling😂😂😂

Here there is the scene that kill the sin counter

Sorry but thats not how fire works

What a team!!

”That’s not good!””THAT’S NOT GOOD!”

All those flames would&#39;ve sucked that area clear of oxygen for quite some time. Dang.

1.) Car cannot outrun heatseakers.2.) Submarines are nuclear powered.3.) Cars cannot block a heatblast to save human life.4.) Villains with such anger management issues can never be successful.

Missiles are slow

That may be the dumbest scene I&#39;ve ever seen in any movie ever.  I love it!

Highly unrealistic

Osm

The trickiest movie in the whole world
That&#39;s my girl

Dom survives missile attacksBut han (Tokyo drift) dies in a crash🤔🤔Edit: i know he didn’t die

Best scene ever bravo to the author 👏👍🏻

&quot;If&quot; this was real they would have been happy at first til the smoke cleared to see a crispy black Dom lol

Keren

Fast and not fate

Best team work everEdit: thx for 1 like

Clinker I mean thinker

Cool

Hobbs and shaw ❌❌❌Hobbs and roman ✔✔✔
Shut up Cipher, That&#39;s the last time you are going to pull that stunt! Now you&#39;re going to let Dom and his crew survive this thing together, you got that?!

kiya bat he very good

It&#39;s pure nonsense that a missile can&#39;t finish sports car within a minutes.

indian film

<b>Why Are You Always Yelling????</b> Yea as a matter of fact, he is

I like how all these explosions don&#39;t even start to melt the ice even slightly.

What a ridiculous scene, and I love it.

Every one knows that that damn ice will break into

Are they missandei and Valkyrie

They didnt have enough money to cast the physics in the movie

In case of submarine (with a nuclear war head on it) explosion please search for the closest car to you and hide behind it till the end of the nuclear winter

Y’all letty proud af of Don and he proud af of her😭😩fucken goals

Wait a sec. A Heat-seeker in the arctic?

I thought these guys were just street racers, not elite special forces

That should have burnt them all alive

The scene where everyone uses cars to protect Dom is a really great scene.
Hahahahahahaha why are you always yelling 😂😂😂😂😂

I Ship Dom and letty❤️ Like this if you agree.

Best scene

He can lift his car whenever he wants to😲😲😲😲😲😲😲

For some reason nobody has enough rational thinking brain cells to understand that they could&#39;ve literally just drove left or right when that submarine was chasing them. I assume they studied at the Prometheus school of running away from things.

Fuckingly wow!!

<a href="">2:57</a> you can see people in the background

What car is the one that has the red fender the one toretos girlfriend have

I wish paul walker was in the movie, do you wish too that paul walker here?

Fak jad dom is the viner

Why do people have to overanalyze these movies? They&#39;re meant to be over the top. They&#39;re made for entertainment. I enjoy the crazy action just as much as I enjoy realistic, gritty movies.

very cool scene!

I dunno... I know Michelle Rodriguez is a staple of the franchise.. but I just cant like her jo matter how hard i try.. her acting really irks me... it&#39;s always serious with her... I&#39;d be in the seat driving the car looking over like &quot;I ain&#39;t gunna lie... I almost peed myself on that one!&quot;  I guess it&#39;s her complete lack of humor.. it&#39;s just remind me of the whitest white girl acting gangster when she says her lines... I dunno why... it&#39;s like she just doesn&#39;t do the part justice to me.. I like her in other movies.. but this one I just xant... it&#39;s almost like she tries to hard to act cool but doesnt have the slick personality for it or something ... anyone else have that issue with her?

From JDM Rides to Exotic Military VehiclesDamnnn

Woow

This is for my son

That’s my girl

That’s not good that’s not good

&quot;Family is forever...&quot;

that&#39;s what i called team work

If only my ml teamates have this kind of good teamwork

I like how they don’t just turn and go around the sub instead they go straight

Fun fact: that submarine looks like akula/alfa submarine and it has a nuclear reactor

Poor Ice Charger, i loved that car.

I don&#39;t now how to work ice charger bcoz it is not like a multiple turbo or any semi or non semi jet ingen ..I think it&#39;s a fake theory..

Hola

They blocked that, that fire with them cars. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaawwww

<a href="">2:59</a>

Dude I always said after like the 6th one denied the laws of physics lmao

I forgot how entertaining this part was 😅😅

Micheal Bay would be proud

Look at this part <a href="">0:14</a>

furious 9

I died when dom said &quot;that&#39;s my girl&quot; ❤️❤️

The way she screams NOW! sends a cold chill down my spine

My favourite seen

I know I sound like a spoilsport but I just can&#39;t stand seeing a Missile having trouble catching up to a car. This makes the same mistake as star wars in that a supersonic projectile becomes slow enough for you to do fancy maneuvers

Hp,h.

This b### is crazy

&quot;That&#39;s my girl&quot; trust. :)

Rocks car was the closest but lettys was first on the spot hell ya

Big explosion
Um yeah no, Dom got burned to death. End of franchise, pack it up, let&#39;s go home.

Cipher: Put a seek heater on him, now. 😤Crew: What?😂🗣️Cipher: NOW!😤🗣️Me: Jesus Christ. Calm down!😱🗣️
I hate when Letty yells &quot;DOMMMM&quot; it is annoying

<a href="">3:10</a> I very love this scene ♥♥♥♥ Beautiful :)
He is always yelling because he is a scary cat...😂😂😂😂😂😂😄🐈🐈🐈🐈

Cipher the cute,

“Put a heat-seeker on him now. Now !!! “

They would do anything for family

<a href="">1:43</a> how did they hear him?lol

Well this looks cool. Wonder if any more furious movies are coming out.

Why are you always yelling😂

Coming up next Fast &amp; Furious 9 - April 10th, 2020 &amp; Fast &amp; Furious 10, April 2nd, 2021 Fast 10 will be the final film of “Fast &amp; Furious Franchise”

THAT IS NOT HOW FIRE WORKS

I like this scene  ,but why? I don&#39;t know... xD....oh wait i know why..... i like Dodge Chargers  and Dom xD

The best scene of all fast and furious movies!!!

Lol that&#39;s not how fire works but okay.

<a href="">3:12</a> maan I wished I had friends like that

This is for my son.

<a href="">3:04</a>

Still can never top his motocross moment in triple X with the heli

Fantastic
Charlize is really cool and beautiful

<a href="">0:25</a> of course is no good

I&#39;m not normally the guy that criticizes physics in movies but c&#39;mon you have to make it somewhat believable. Like there are so many times when I&#39;m just like that&#39;s never gonna happen

I gotta admit I liked the old movies I don&#39;t really like the new ones cause now they&#39;re getting involved with the government and agencies and stuff. I liked the old ones because they were on they&#39;re own

i would just turn

This is why you should pay attention in physics class in your high class!

Roman:get us outta here Hobbs: y r u always yelling

Yeah.....no

Remember when Dom and Brian were just drag racing Eclipse, RX7’s, and Supras?

This is pure awesomeness!

Damnn this is a good scene

The bad guys are like OH HELLLLLLL NAWWM😂

You got wows  and some weed

&quot; this this is for my son &quot;

What dialogue is given Dwayne Johnson to Roman pearce

After busting the submarine what happens to Dom

Like the shittiest fast film ever since toyko drift. Smh. Also why does the director make it seem like dom dies at the end of every film ever since fast 6??????????

cant wait for the return of one thingculture and street racing

Most epiC WoRdS &quot;That&#39;s My GirL👈🔥💋&quot;
No lies this movie is dumb literally all about family looks like they ran out of ideas

<a href="">0:35</a> <b>rocket league intensifies</b>

Best Part This Was For My Son
