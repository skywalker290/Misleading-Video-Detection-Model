Itna Important role ek flop actor ko derahe hey. gayi paise panime

If Arjun's acting is done by Farhan Akhtar then Mahabharat will flop.
Lalrothang Haoginlal is a very nice person
Hrithik Roshan as eklavya will be fun.Dronacharya will be shocked after asking for a thumb.😂

Danvir Karan Ki Jai Ho shrvshreshth Dhnur Dhr Karan Ki Jai Ho 😭😭😭
Danvir Karan Ki Jai Ho shrvshreshth Dhnur Dhr Karan Ki Jai Ho 😭😭😭
DD TV MAHABHARATA WAS A REAL VYASA MUNIS WRITTEN STORY ❤❤
Amir Khan roles as a lord Krishna..Grt job by Amir Khan.. it would be grt significant of Islamic and Hindus religious friendly nature..appreciate

If he is Aamir then he should be removed and he should not even be given the role of a soldier.
Those who don't want to see Aamir Khan in this movie should like it.
Who will Aamir Khan be called?
.

Fake news

Already boycotting for seeing Aamir khan as Shri Krishna

Muslims will be removed from India
Deepika Padukone is perfect for droupati

😂😂😂 will rot again..
Mahesh babu Shree Krishna roll
Arjuna or shree Krishna cast are not fit  to character&#39;s

Or should the role of Dronacharya be given to Sunny Deol? The film will be a super duper hit.
Sunny Deol should be given the role of Mahabali Bheem
Hrithik Roshan hai to best hai

Hrithik Roshan

Don't watch any movie after watching an adipursh from bollywood movie, make it yourself, watch it yourself, it's a fool, not even a single actor has given a role, given a useless role to all others or gave good roles to useless actors.
Hare Mahadev ho
Change carecter krisna and Arjun

100% Mahabharat movie will be a hit because Hrithik Roshan is playing the role of Karan.
Sourabh raaj jain should be given the role of krishna❤❤❤

Krishna ka roll sahi actress ko karao

Absolutely true brother
Br Chopra great

Br Chopra great

y movies mat banao sab k sab apne par pe pe axe Marney ja rehiye
Lol

Krishna Ji: AamirOr Karna / Arjun ka Role - Salman / Shahrukh.... Who has proved once again that he is the original mother (Karn/Arjun) Then watch this Mahabharat Movie, what a Super Duper Blockbuster Hit hoti in teeno ki Jodi's performance of making Roghtey Khade came💥💥
Why all bollywood people making this holy book. This is crap

No one can beat Pooja Sharma as Droupadi❤❤. She is the best. Nor Dipika neither or..

Sourabh Raj Jain as Krishna was Krishna&#39;s selection to play Krishna🙏🙏

Starplus mahavarat is the bestest ever❤❤.. There is no comparison of it.. The all cast of starplus mahavarat just nailed and lived their character. Huge respect and Biggest fan

Amir khan can't be krishnaMtlab iss mahabharat me v galat dikhaya jaiga
Aamir Khan&#39;s character of Lord Krishna is not shot at all

Many actors are not shot according to their character

Only 👀 aamir sir

Mahabharat is what is Muslim in it?
Amir doesn't look good
This is wrong
By reading mahabharat 10-20 times, you can make a mouthful of cum. 🙄🙄👿👿👿👿👿 Aamir Khan, why do you want to get your cunt shaved or get your cunt stuck in your mouth?
Aamir Khan started with Shri Krishna and then Mahabharat will be there and the movie will be there.
There is no film like this
Ab what nahi hota

Fake

Wow super hit

Brother Mahabharat's link is about to be released, this movie will be released, Mahabharat sb will be forgotten.
If this cow meat eating Islamic terrorist wolf plays the role of Lord Krishna then no Hindu will listen to this cheap film and this film will be boycotted.
The world is about to be set on fire 😮😮
Shree Krishna ji ka role Mahesh Babu ko dena tha

Aamir Khan should have been cast as Durkhan.
Sanju Baba Bhim ka role Dijiye nice body❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😊😊😊
If the character is like Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana and Mahabharata. An army of jokers has been gathered here.
Shakuni ka role ranbir Singh ki chahiye

Arjun's role. Prabhas should have done it
Amir khan is not a match for krishna

Amir Khan as Krishna makes no sense. Either it should be Akshay Kumar or Ranbir Kapoor as Krishna. Best option would be RK, keeping in mind box office performance.

Why would you guys ruin it for us 😢 Amir as Shri Krishna 😮😢

Very stupid blockbuster movie
Akshay Kumar should have got the role of Arjun or then Tiger Shroff.
Super Flop. Amitabh will play Bhishma and Aishwarya Rai will play Ganga, i.e. Amitabh Bachchan's daughter-in-law will become Amitabh Bachchan's mother? What a joke. Bollywood lost even that much. And Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai should also feel ashamed. And Abhishek Bachchan as Dushasana? He deserves Krishna role. Aamir Khan not permitted as Krishna. Rajamauli has made fun of the epic.
Madarchodo Prabhash to Arjun
In my opinion krishna is Hrittik Roshan, Arjun is Vijay Devrakonda, yudhistir is Ranveer Kapoor, Karn is vidyut, Nakul is avishek bachhan, Duriyadhan is Yash

A well written... well known epic story par bhi yeh log kuch na kuch gadbad kar he denge....

No non hindu actors in this history series/movie. It is our history and those who have same history as us, as in hindu actors only should be casted for krishna role

Did we say that we are Hindus?
First clarify yourself and then share further.
Sri Krishna mhanun...

Yancya aayivji tr na Mahesh Babu Yana ghyayla pahije tyanchavr he sut hoil.....
WHERE IS THIS MOVIE????

Karan 🏹
Hindu Dhram Ka upman hoga Log Kaheyege Ki ye nange Khapde pehan Ke Jism Dikane wale hindu Gods hai

Aamir Khan is not Krishna.....Akshay is the best role to play.
Karna's rule must have been learned by Prabhash.
Now boycott this movie because we can't see all the double people in the form of our ideals.
This Fan Made trailer has 10M+ views very powerful crazypan 🥵🔥💥💪

Should Madhuri get the role of Drupati?
Acter ? 👎
Kya milta h Tumhe ye fake video banane me thodi sarm karlo

Whatever you told is not a trailer of Mahabharat, madam, it is information about Mahabharat movie.
This is all a fictitious story…instead of wasting money in this, show history to people….
Devar Kutru Pujari Bidala
Nitish Bardwaj has played the role of Shri Krishna very well. Yakin na ho to pb.r. Watch Chopra's Mahabharat
Wish to give Ajay Devgqn to Lord Shri Krishna.
Nice

Har Har Mahadev 👍
Thank u .s rajamouli
And Prabhas got the role of Arjun
Sanjay datt ko Bheem ka roll dena chahiye tha. To maja aajega film dekhne ka

Anti-patriotic people will keep barking from the drain of Kandu Ashram. If you all are the children of a baab then show Amir Khan out of this stupid film. We Muslims don't even want anyone to eat Shaan Khan of Bollywood. He is wasting his talent for bigoted dogs. If there is no film going on then Aamir's character will be cast. I have also said that Aamir Khan will not work in the film.
No matter how many great verses are created, no one can compete with the original. Jai Shree Ram Jai Sanatan Dharma.
Aamir Khan film's Kiss Nahin should be
All Hindus will boycott Muslims in Mahabharata
Casting is not looking right. Arjun's role should be played by Hrithik. Arjun's role is the main role in Mahabharat and it has been given to the actor.
Akshay was to play the role of Krishna, Arjun Mahesh Babu, ruin of Bollywood, Boycott
Saurabh Jain is the real Krishna, the one who should become Duryodhana in the movie is becoming Krishna, Hat Teri Bollywood
AAMIR IS NOT PERFECT 4 IT

SHY

prostitutes, pimps, jihadis doing Mahabharat
This film will not be easy, Aamir Khan can do it but everyone will have to work together with power unity.
Why muslim in movie pakistani amir.ban amir

Nice fantacy...but it will not happened....Prabhas or Shahrukh as Karna, Ram Charan or  hrithik as Arjun and Rana or jr. NTR as Bhima, amithab or rampal or mohan lal as Bhishma, Mahesh Babu or  Salman as Sri Krisha, Alia Bhatt as kunthi, Saif Ali Khan as Dhritha rashtra, also Alia can be paanchaali droupadi and Kajol or Madhuri as gandhari and gulshan as Shakuni and Ranvir Kapoor as Dhuryodhana and Pooja Hegde as Subhadra and so...just my prediction

Aamir should not be given the role of Krishna, Hrithik should be given the role of Krishna, what is so special about him?
I should not be made Shri Krishna.
Boycott will happen
Change the role of Shri Krishna. Apart from Aamir Khan, there are other very good actors who should get a chance. Shri Krishna is the best actor for the best of God. Shri Krishna is a special God of Hindu religion. The creator of Bhagwat Geeta is the main one because of a mistake. The entire movie will go by code, it would be better to give the role of Shri Krishna to an actor who is better than Aamir Khan.
It&#39;s going to be and epic

Exited For Karan 🔥
Suryaputra Karan 🔥
Which dates will be in 2023?
Mahabharat movie kab release hoga

Once again the same mistake is being made, an attempt is made to degrade Hindu characters and elevate Muslim ones, Aamir Khan plays the role of Lord Krishna and Ajay Devgan plays the role of Duryodhan, a villain.
Aamir Khan should not get the role of Krishna
Film??

Mr perfectionists is perfect for every role in all his movies.

Mahabharata film should be made with South actors.
This is nonsense about making films.
Saguni character rajinikanth seidhaal super.
Boycott Bollywoody MAHABHARATA

Sourabh Raj Jain should have been made Sumedh Mudhgelkar.
In this movie, give good characters to good actors otherwise the movie will not work.
Arjun Salman or Shahrukh.
The role of Bheem should be given to Sunny Deol
Radhe Radhe
Gulshan grover may not be a right choice as shakuni. A powerful  and convencing actor is needed for this role. Perhaps Shaeed kapoor or Saif Ali Khan?

Which character should Salman Khan give?
Fake news. Do not spread lies just to get attention.

It will be a huge flop because now everyone knows the story of Mahabharata.
Hrithik Roshan as Karna ❤️❤️ plz
A few good South actresses were given the role of Dropati... Why were the heroines given the role of Dropati?
Dropadii's royal gift was given to Sai Pallavi.
Dipika nagiii ko dropati deviii ka roal kyu diyaaa bakkchodi, benchod ko.. kutti ngiii ko...
Eenn nagge ko hakkk nhi he mahabharat jese grantho chunna ..

I don't like the role of Arjun.
So Mahabharat has become the worst movie of Bollywood.
When is it released?
It is true that all the characters are baseless, they are useless, they cannot do anything.
Krishna Prabhu's role should not be aamir khan
Karan Johar really looks like a jack
Imagine nawazuddin siddique as shakuni
or any muslim to play

we dont want see khans

Johar KO do Row ko
Yah Jihadi, now you will play the role of our God, your film will be a flop even before it comes out.
Yaar, who did we ask you to make Krishan, we Aamir Khan feels unsafe in India, how can he play the role of our revered Lord Shri Krishan, brother, he is making money and will do his film in India.😡😡
Br copra mahabhart

The one who made fun of Lord Shiva in PK film is getting the role of Lord Krishna, it is shameful for Sanatan Dharma.
Wow, what a thing, these Muslim actors are also doing good roles in Mahabharat to earn money.
Sala Dipika nahi lo naak se dialogue hai
Who would like to see Karan Jahaar playing the role of Sakuni?
My hero karna  🙏
Sb to thik hai bas Shri krishna ka role Aamir khan ko nahi dena tha, jiski wjh se ab is movie ko bhi hume boycott krna hoga.... Boycott Amir khan Boycott Mahabharat

Amir khan as Krishna not acceptable

Aamir Khan will not play the character of Shri Krishna 100%
Falop sabit hogi

Where is the movie?

Who can play the role of Krishan like Surabh Raj Jain?
I loved only star plus mahabharat. All actor s of star plus mahabharat

Aamir Khan Khan Shabi Khan's role should be given in Mahabharat, Mahabharat should be given to Abhimanyu's character Govinda, Abhimanyu Arjun's character should be given to Govinda.
Boolivood boycott
can anyone beat vidyut in action? then why he is given small character role? vidyut deserves role of Arjun or Karna.

No one will come by blabbering
I will not pay.
Amir khan k toh Iss movie de band karna Chahiye tha

Baby film is being made
Diwali ho gya..... where&#39;s the movie?

Shree krishna role should be given to Sourav raj Jain .No one can act like him in the form of Shri Krishna.￼

Prabhas will be fine in the role of Arjun or Yudhisthir.
Rajmauli, what mad man has he gone, why does he not play anything in the south?
The role of Lord Kirshan should be of any Hindu religion and not of Muslim.
Allow this movie to be made my south indian director.

i Don&#39;t like farhan Akhter suit this role arjun

chhutiye hai sab

Mahabharata tolerates very little garbage...
Comments: Karn-Amir Khan, Krishna- Hrittik Roshan, Duryodhan - Farhan Akhtar, Arjun - Arjun Rampal, Vim- probhash, Nakul- Viddyut, Sahadev-Ranveer Singh.
I am Aamir Khan please don't beat him less.
Hritik my fev. H jo krna ka roll krega, par yaar yeh roll akki ko diya jaye to sach me krna ka roll khatrnak hota,

Ram ok

Warning to SS Rajmouli &gt; Amir khan is not acceptable as Lord Krishna. Your movie will be BANNED. Please note it...

Yaar jab tum jothi jothi khani banaoge kamane aur andh bhat banane ke liye to acchi to lagegi na

Amir Khan  as krishna 🙂🙂🙂 speechless

Star cast is a fail. Donot like Amir khan as Krishna.

Because of Kamal Haasan and Aamir Khan being in this film, I don't want to watch this film and many people will not watch this film.
Very good box office per-very challenging Mahabharat
Krishan ji's character should be given to Hindu actor, that's why it is so good, Jai Rajputana 🔥🚩
Sri krishna ji ka role saurabh raj is the best

Mc is emotional
Aamir Khan, a dirty person with anti-national and anti-Sanatan Dharma Jihadi mentality, should not be cast in the film. This is an insult to Sanatan Dharma.
You will not destroy the meaning.
I don't want a movie
Bann

Bhai Shree krishna k role mai Amir khan kis angle se suit karte hai, seriously 🙄

This mian has got the role of Lord Krishna... isn't there someone else, this can't be possible.
Karan is beast 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Isa bahubali ka director banay to acha Hoga

Aamir Khan as Shree Krishna is best choise because the best actor is Aamir Khan in Blooywood no one can beat him in acting ❤️

The film is going to be a blast, now you will have to forgive me.
Very little
Everyone will get a better price
Super flop hoga

Vidhut Jhambal should get the role of Raran 🙏🏻
😘

Who will become Karna and Duryodhana?
Muslim nko allowed mat karo me ase v Muslim nehi dekh ne bale movie so actors v Hindu hone chahihe

Please do not put cheap CGI in movies.

No matter how hard you try, no one can create something like BR Chopra.
Abee kya bakwas hai Achhe actoro ko lete na ki famous

Aamir khan as shri krishna 🤮
🔴 Wow, the cap guy will now play the role of Shri <a href="">#Krishna</a> ji.😡😡
Saheer as Arjun....Saurabh as Krishna......Aham as karn flim hit jayega

Krishna our Arjun Amir Khan our Farhan What a joke

Add alu arjun in this movie as well

Aamir Khan was given the role of Agra Krishan and then he insulted Hindus because it was my face that made us not watch the movie.
All this will never happen in the South.
Prabhas is best actor

<a href="">#Amir</a> Khan is playing the role of Krishna who makes fun of Hindu religion. Mahabharat is being made with all the Bollywood actors displaying nudity. This doesn't suit you guys. Jai Shri Ram.
After this film, the names of the heroes will change. Fans will call them after the characters of the film. It will be a lot of fun. Shakuni Aaya Re, Jai Hanuman, Duryodhan.
1,Mahabharat 2,Adipurus 3,Ramayan, will these 3 films last a week?
Deepika and Ranveer movie flopped 🤦
<a href="">

100 percent flop

Sare mc ko hamare bhagwan bna do teri maka

Hey, are you making a film or Khichdi?
Hindu is the villain and he is the hero.
boycott this film. no reality of MAHABHARATA. Every Hindu should boycott this film. There are children of fanatics in this.
Bcoz of amir khan people will boycott this movie.

Again no no, hindus are happy with B. R chopra Mahabharata the star cast no one can beat.

Sri Krishna ka role dijiyega akxay Kumar Ko Sri Krishna ka role dijiyega rikvet he Bhai in Hindu Jai hind Jai Sri Ram Ji
Nothing from the story will help the Hindus of the country.
Re editing adiburush trailer
I see all Khans given good roles like Krishna , Arjuna and Hindu actors given nagitive roles like Dhuryodhan and Dhushasan. For god sake y do these ppl agree for such roles.. y should we have these Khans in such vital roles whose prominence they don&#39;t  understand

I think  so good all-over  crikter

Worst casting 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kiran's role has been passed since morning.
Aamir Khan has been given the wrong role of Krishna
Akshay Kumar is the best choice for Karisha in Mahabhara.
These people don't want to make a doctor movie because money is wasted.
What has Krishna, the Hindu hero, done to kill this evil person?
Abe ye Amir Khan gou mata ko khane wala bhagwan shree krishna banenge are yaar ,,, ghor kalyug he

Ramayan Yahabharat, this is not for you, you have to put your life in it.. why are you wasting money, leave it and find another work.
For star cast wow

Mahabharata Old Mahabharata Why do you tamper with old texts? You people don't get any other story to make films in the world.
Karan johar is sikhandi

What are you doing Amir Khan 🏴‍☠️
it will be super duper FLOP movie in last 3 decades.

Bheem ki bhumika. The Great Khali. ko dena Chahiye

Amir Khan can&#39;t beat Nitish Bhardwaj roll in Mahabharat

PK should not be taken in the role of Krishna who says that anointing Shivalinga with milk is like wasting milk. The character should be same in reel and real life. This is artificial. He then appears in multiple roles to fool the audience.
Whatever you are, you are a double born..
Saurabh Raj Jain as krishna

Again hindu drama joke
Lag raha hai iska budget 2000 crore hoga 😂 bhai itne me tho 20-30 film ban jati hai 😂

Brother that is Ramayan
Movie ko part 1, 2, 3 karkae bannah chahiyae. Like The Lord of the Ring.

Incarnation of Shri Krishna to Sunny Paaji
If you want to make it then make a full ep.
Moves will be made to sort out Mahabharat. Sorry for not correcting what Mahabharat is.
There will be talk of bones, friend. BC, those who have never understood Hindu Dharma and have not accepted it in their lives. One Aamir Khan Krishna and the other Farhan Akhtar Arjun. Both are unrealistic and unacceptable. Chi.
Why Amir khan or Farhan Akhtar? Jinhe Hindu culture ka knowledge bhi nai.

Farhan as Arjun as Aamir as Shri Krishna..God help this movie....

Vidhut Jammal should be collected for the character of Arjun.
Aamir Khan wo v Krishan hahahaha ,,,bs yhi mile Krishan bnane ko

bycott..I absolutely can't see Aamir Khan in the role of Krishna and would like to waste money on a movie, he will make me drink water to some poor person.....
Aamir Khan's height of 5 feet and age of 60 years would only suit the role of Kalia Naag.
Where can i watch

Aamir Khan would have a lot of problems if he got the role of Keeshna.
Those who do not believe in Hindu religion, they will narrate stories of Hindu religion. Boycott. I don't want to see it.
Will all the Hindu artistes have played Ashram in the movie or can those who are Muslims like Aamir Khan get the role of God? Will Bollywood run its agenda in the movie too so that once again Aamir Khan can get a chance? This is how we will do it again and again, we will have to boycott the movies of such people like Aamir Khan and Bollywood (<a href="">#Hindutav</a>)
Boycott Bollywood movie

It is absolutely crazy that Raja Mauli has lost his mind.
Another One for the Boycott Gang 😂

The role of Shakuni Mama should be given to Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the film will be a hit.
Amir kon not a perfect for shree krishna 😔

Sourabh Jain is perfect for shree krishna role

Bakwash casting🫢
Boycott Aamir Khan. ! Boycott

Shri Krishna ka kildar bahubali ko milta

Now make this also cartoon mat 😆
Prabhas

BOYCOT CHUTIYA BOLLYWOOD..

Prabhas arjun Ka role karta to Thoda Achha lagtaN abhishek bachhan ko dushyasan Ka role suit Nhi karta

Is movie ke kuch face change kr de to ye movie achi lgegi, vrna me to nhi dekhne wala ye movie

there r better actors than aamir khan fo shri krishan

Super star's confluence will be mahabharat
Baki sb patar sahi lekin Krishna ke roll mein Ameer khan thik h

Looking at the situation, a scripted role would have been a good fit for Aamir Khan.
Just give the role of Shri Krishna and Arjun to someone else... Please... Mahabharat is my favorite poem... What are you doing, friend?
Bollywood movie ko boycott jarur karaga

Best

check if any other actor in bollywood is left. Mauli will cast him/her too

All Bollywood movie boycott

has taken the traitors
We don&#39;t want any Khan in Maharashtra

No hero of Hollywood is wanted in Tollywood.
No one can do Krishna's acting by himself.


When will you come brother?
WILL BOYCOTT IF AAMIR CHICHA DOES ROLE IN THIS MOVIE, MIND IT.. ..

please don&#39;t destroy our pride remember you&#39;re playing with our emotions i hope they don&#39;t let us down!

Shakuni ki vajah se yud hua tha

Only Deepika Padukone's election is valid.
I don&#39;t like bollywood make mahabharat  ,because they many times hearts of hindu sentiments

It is true that the role of Bheem should be given to someone whose body or height is true. The role of John Abraham or Arjun should be given to Vidyut Jamwal. Farhan actor should be given the role of Nakul.
Who made Shakuni Nasiruddin?
This boy will never play the role of Arjun in Mahabharat...boycott
Arjun ka paatra tiger shroff ko dena chahiye tha

Boycott Aamir Khan, Dipika Padukone, break the gang into pieces, don't watch anti-national films.
Money west

Amair khan not shree krishna and akshay kumar ko Banaya jai

Aamir Khan should not be in the movie nor will we boycott him.
Cause of amir khan this mahabharat will be biggest flop ...

Bhagwan shri krishna ka roll Amir Khan ko mat do agar movie hit chahte ho or agar average chahte ho toh de do

I can&#39;t see Ajay Devgan and Abhishek Bachchan in negative roll

Akshay Kumar Shri Krishna
Adhipurush 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fake news

Who waiting for vidhyut jamwal

Amir khan ko krisna ka role nahi kans ka role main thik hain

Why amir khan Krishna&#39;s role...

Vidyut jamwal as nakul majak chal raha hai ???? Vidyut deserves as Arjuna 🥺🥺
Boycott amir khan mahabharat
Karan's role Parbhas
Mahesh Babu can look good for Krishna role

Akshay Kumar was asked to play Krishna's Kedar
Mahabharata has a soul 🚩🚩The soul of the eternal 🚩🚩
Sri krishna akshay kumar ke dekhti chai
Only hindu achors  should  do  mahabharat  please  🔥

bycut

Sourav raj is best and also Nitish Bhardwaj is best but Sarvadaman D. Banerjee he is  legend. He is acting in Ramanand Sagar shri krishnaJai shri krishna

Hrithik as karn not good...he should be krishna or arjun

Amir Khan Krishna 😡😡😡😡
Mahabharata is the new jugaad to detonate bombs
# boycott Aaamir Khan

I aware don't caste amir khan as krishna 🤬🤬🤬 maiya kasam movie lakh achi ho kabhi nahi dekhne jaunga
Khan could not play the role of Krishna as he did. Mahabharat will be made public at his home.
We will not watch this film in which an anti-national, slipper cell and a mentally ill person who insults the faith of Hindus has been given the name of Krishna Ji.
Always legend jai shree  Krishna 🙏🙏🙏

😖😞😟😟

This great actor will have to be given money.
It&#39;s real or facke

Dimak mat kiya
Boycott Aamir Khan from this film
aamir khan as dushasan ,Salman as duryodhan, sarukh as sakuni...film hit

Plzzz south movie actor plzzz Bollywood k sath mat banao movies.......we are all love south movies.. Bollywood boycott..with Bollywood actor

Don't watch Aamir's movie
When will this film be released?
Bollywood is showing its father
Bheem's character Vidyut Jambal was right
Boycott to Amir Khan because any Khan does not believe in Hindu religion then why? Start boycotting Pure Jose on Diwali.
Ok

bollywood actor not perfect south hero perfect this movie
Karn not perfect ritik

Amir not perfect krishna

Allu Arjun or Ram Charan should be in the role of Shri Krishna.
Aamir Khan is in a role in the movie, he should not be compared, he insults Hindu religion.
Dangal ki first position gayi
Nahi shalega mahabharat 2 artist will have to be changed
Nice 🙂 .
Will be sooooperhit.

There will be boycott again if Aamir Khan happens to be there.
Arjun n duryodhana actor sahi nahin
Amir khan as shree krishna?????  Who is the Director  of this movie?  Such a stupid.

No Khan&#39;s will be in Mahabharat movie we just don&#39;t need of them in any role or charecters of History, they do change real to reel...🙏🚩

Amir khan ko sri krishna nai banana tha

Jai kuruvansh Jai Bhishma Pitamah
Yikes! 🤮 Who wants to see the same old same old Bollywood faces ruining our dharm granth Mahabharat.Listening to Amir Khan&#39;s voice in &quot;Yada Yada hi Dharmasya..&quot; made me vomit 🤮

Boycott Amir Khan

Aamir Khan is trying to moderate Hindus once again.
Aamir Khan FIR once against Hindu
Release kab hoga???

There will be a boycott of this film
We do not want to see Aamir Khan as Shri Krishna, new artists should come, Hindu artists.
Krishna was dark skinned. Even the Gods and Goddesses have to have skin lightening to make the story acceptable to people. It&#39;s sad. The British made people ashamed of their skin and now that shame is carried to the Gods - Gods and Goddesses have to be sexy or no one will enjoy their story.

Shree Krishna Yancha Roll Saurabh Jain yana dya movie ajun hit hoil
Why are you watching Khan in such a movie?
I am wyting
Boycott

No, Ajay Devgan's place was taken by South actor Ranadugbati and Deepika Padukone's place was taken by Priyanka Chopra.
Super hit hogi movie

The role of Duryodhana in Br Chopra is amazing 👍
They are not bad names in Mahabharat, Shree Krishna, Ramayana.. but those who have done good, they have become busy in the minds of those people.
Is katmulle ko nikal do movie se nahi to boycott ho sakta h

It&#39;s an epic totally based on Hindus beliefs and culture .so amir khan is not a write person for this character (lord krishna ) 🙏🚩

Now there is nothing official
Now there will be a good movie, I have requested her to do acting.
A joke
There is no such thing as Aamir in the role of Shree Kishna or Farhan in the role of Arjun. It is fake news that Rajamoli will never be cast in the lead role.
Aamir Khan's mind has become thick, aah has he?
There is a chance of flop because of Aamir.
Tumhe kya amir khan call kiya tha.

Chanel name
😠Boycott⚔️,Aamir,Hrithik Jihadi🇵🇰,Mahabharat✊✊
Where are south Indian big names..???we have many south bigg actors like allu arjun,ntr,ram Charan,surya..so on what about them.we want south actors too and ur puting Aamir Khan as lord Krishna ..wah wahh

We don't want to see their Mahabharata
Amir khan as Krishna 😫

Those people who are making fun of Hindu Gods and Goddesses are playing the role of Hindu God… these people are doing everything for the sake of money.
Boycott Bollywood

Don't give the role of Krishna to Aamir Khan, he has already been boycotted.
Why was Aamir Khan given the role of Krishna, Aamir Khan has already been boycotted, people are angry with the Bollywood hero, then why was a Muslim actor cast in a movie like Mahabharata, this will be an insult to Hindus, the film flopped. Maybe, the role of Krishna should have been given to Hrithik Roshan. Why did you give that to Amir Khan, he won't shoot.
What happened to Lal Singh Chaddha?
Don’t take any Bollywood actors they are very much champu, very fair skinned ….. we need rowdy actors as prabhas, Kamal Hassan , NTR etc .

Ye film full off Hojayegi because Isme Aamir Khan ranvir singh jaise actor h Jo dharm K baare m ulta seedha bolte h

What a joke ☹️Ganga's son Bheeshm (Amitabh Bachchan) and Ganga Aishwarya Rai 🤣🤣
Flop flop flop............ Aamir should play the role of Dharitrashtra, he is not worthy of playing the role of Karishan, the film will flop, we made fun of Shri Karishan in PK film, what is the insult, should we say Shri Krishna? Giving away the role is the biggest insult to our God Shri Krishna.
It is not possible to present Mahabharata in three hours❌
The one who is a fan of Vidut Jambaal should do the same.
Sorabh raj nahi to Akshay kumar Sahi hai 😃
Very good, explosive film is about to happen 🙏🏻
Isey bhi boycott karenge... We don&#39;t want Amir Khan in any movie 😡

Abhimanyu ka roll

If he makes prejudice and slight on the spectators, they will not forgive him for it and avoid it in droves! This is a litmus test on his respect of the nation’s ethos and civilization! Tread carefully Aamir, this a do or die for you!

I am very happy that Prabhas got the role of Bheem, it felt good after that, which role should I give to you, Arjun Karol, Yash should be given the role, please Mauli Sahab, Duryodhan's role should be given to Rana, Maulaji, thank you very much Maulvi Sahab, I am eagerly waiting for this film. I am waiting
Hrithik roshan karna 💥💥💥💥
Prabhas, Vidyut and Arjun Rampal plays a very important role  . But not agreed with all stars kids like Deepika , Ranveer and Amir Khan

Baykot amirkhan

No one is from Bollywood bs
Amir Khan be like sakuni

After boycotting Aamir n next Hrithik Roshan ..rajmouli shld think abt starcast of mahabharath...think abt ur future movies Rajamouli Sir.

If they take Amir, shahrukh in this type of movie....then I will not watch it 🙏🙏🙏

Kalki avatar aaya hai mahamad sahib the pure truth will be visible.
Motherchod .... Muslims ko es flim se vagao......  Boykot this flim

amir and Farhan doesnt suit in that role..... Raja mouli should consider Hritik for Krishna Bhagwan role and Vidyut for Arjun

Aamir Khan as Krishna , not accepted😠. Boycott, boycott

If you remember even a little bit of Hindu scriptures, you will become Mahabharata in the country.
Amir shri krishna ke rol me nhi jamta

boycott amir khan
Aamir Khan should not be given the role of Krishan
The role of Karan should be given to Vidyut Jamwal.
Wokas movie hogi
This film will be flipped. 😂

Es amir khan ko kyu le liya Yeh dogle log hai Pith me chura ghopne ka kam haiP. K. movie me es dogle insan ne hindu devi - devtao ka bahut apman kiya haiDont like any movie of amir khan

Saurabh Jain se achaa koi nahi as shree krishna
D Boss

I think Rana Ko Bhem's role has not been fulfilled.
Super Hit
Make a filme with bheem as prabhas dhuryodhan as rana dagupathi

Never happend this filme with these acters

Amir Khan the bastard now came begging for south roles.....Itz shameful for such a cult to given any role ....Amir Khan is known for anti hindu sentiments how can he be given the role of Krishna....First ask him weather he believes in Krishna....

No one is similar to Almighty krishna  He is one and he was one he will be one no one can match him 🐚☸️🚩this is kaliyug where people do things for their profit

<a href="">#Boycottamirkhan</a>

Sabne likh hi diya to hm v likh hi dete hai....no any cinemas and serals can beat DD one channel&#39;s Mahabharat.👌

Srikrishna or a mulla la*d chalegi film
Don&#39;t take Amir khan in this movie

Tahlka machine wala hai

No Khan give role to decent one madhavan

Maha bakwas….Harami Aamir Khan…..never deserve to play the role of Sree Krishan's pair of jute….no god can he play the role of Sree Krishan…. ......Bakwas
Nonsense
The act of Shri Krishna has been given to the wrong actor..😡
What kind of movie are you making? Rajmoli sir is playing the role of a great Muslim actor like (Krishn or Arjuna), or a Muslim actor like (Kran, or Duryodhn) is playing the role of a Hindu actor. Boycott movie.
Ranbir Singh should get the role of Duryodhan.
Sourabh raj jain is best

If any propaganda is spread as per your wish, then Lolal Singh Chaddha will be a super duper flop, it will be badly beaten and the propaganda is because only 3 months are left for Diwali, which means the film is almost completed and everyone whose name is being mentioned in this film, not even one of them is in the role. It is being shown just like this that if he was playing the role then no one should have had any objection to showing him in his real role. On the contrary, this would have been the promotion of the film. If such a film was really being made then it would have shown the characters in their roles and shown them in their roles. That this is just one propaganda being spread so that sympathy can be generated in our minds towards Bollywood films so that we get the feeling in our mind that look, a film is being made on our holy book and we should make their films a hit, go and watch their films, but now people will not fall into their trap as much as us. An insult has been done, the time has come to pay for it, and a cheap film maker like PK is playing the role of Shri Krishna. Sinful deeds never leave you, the time has come to pay for the sins he has committed.
bahot hi bakvas actor liye hai Amir khan ko Shri Krushna ka role. aur bhi kai logo ke role ase log hai  fir to ye movie release hi nahi hone denge

Amir khan bbbb

It is not 100% that this artist will make a movie.
Where is Akshay Kumar,,

Aamir khan krishna Kyo Boycott
Nitish Bhardwaj Always Legend
Why don't you give honor to this film? Coz don't give the role of Shree Krishna ji to a mullah because this mullah insults Lord Shiva and why did you give him the role? What kind of a mullah did he do after making this film? 😠😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Remove me from the role of God
Krishna to Saurabh Jai Hi A6a Lagata Hai Dusara Koi Nai
The role of our God is not that of a Jihadi.
Agar Amir khan h film to baycott amir

Krishna ji's role Saurabh Jain should get the best rahta
Deepika is the worst character Deepika is dirty actor
If this is so then Bollywood is trying to correct its mistakes. Say Jai Shree 🙏Ram
Krishna ki bhumika amir khan      matlab krishna ka apman......

There is no actor like Mahabharat's Nitish Bhardwaj or Shri Krishna's Sarv Daman Banarji.
Hi

Sabse achhe shrikrishna nitin bhardwaj hi hai
If you make the idiots of Bollywood a flop, they will leave no stone unturned in insulting God.
Mahabharat is not meant to be criticized, it is our religion.
Amir Khan ki bas ki bat nhi hay
Akshay Kumar as krishna
Muslim actor should make Arjun and Krishna.
Prabhas is karna character perfect match

Prabhas is karna character perfect match

Prabhas is karna character perfect match

Prabhas is karna character perfect match

Prabhas is karna character perfect match

Prabhas is karna character perfect match

Amir hight is not perfect for Krishna. Mahash babu is best.

Goosebumps waaooo waiting to see karna as Hrithik roshan

It will be insulting to Indians to see Aamir Khan in any of the positive roles in Mahabharat. He may be good as Shakuni or Jaidrath or Dhrtarashtr

Brother, this Khan can then insult our Lord Krishna as he did to Lord Shiva. This Khan will definitely give wrong teachings or he will insult God.
If it will be possible then for sure It will cross 10,000 crores and can be the highest grossing filim byDefeating endgame and avatar

Full one👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 BOULAKBS STR movie 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
No one will see
Highly disappointed after seeing Amir Khan in movie. Whenever something related to Hindus is made, muslims are the first one to jump into it, obviously, for known reasons. In movie Prithviraj recently, Prithvi has been shown as someone not too rich and powerful and that he instigated Ghori to attack by grating refuge to his brother Mir. I mean Wtf have they made out of our history.😡😡😡

Mahesh babu is best character  for krishana

If Aamir Khan had taken the role of Krishna ji in Mahabharat, this film would have flopped.
Aamir Khan nahi
Wrong people have been criticized for Shree Krishna or Arjun 👎
The role of Shri Krishna should be given to Akshay Kumar.
Surv Jain should play the role of Krishna.
Muslims should not be seen in this film, if it happens then my statement is that Sobi Sonatoni should boycott it.
Chutiya banana band kro

Some character should be changed, I think so

Armir Khan Hindu na Muslim
Krishna the most suited is one and only in starplus. I think they should take him as Krishna

Mahabharat hai ise badanam na kare   Bollywood

Hrithik Roshan got the best role in this.
This starcast has been told to you by your own account..
Amir khan doesn't want banana but Krishna ji.
Bollywood me aur kon kon actor and actress h unka bhi nam bata dooo

The role of Lord Shri Krishna should not be given to Amir Khan.
Good

This is going to be a super flop.....is this a joke...this game will not harm the faith of Hindus....
pk jasa to ne hai aamir khan
Aamir Khan ko hatao nhi me boycott karta hu is movie ko

Mahabharata ka Movie will come in Hindi Dubbed Prabhash ka Movie
Those great heroes of Mahabharata who have 10 names (Arjun Parth Dhananjay Jaya Vijaya Mahabahu Bharat Savyasachi) by changing their character.
To establish the religion, Lord Krishna became the charioteer of Arjun ji and that Arjun ji was for Shree Krishna.
Are you official also or have you just put likes for views and subscription.
I will not watch this movie
Jhat jaisa laga

None of them deserve to work in this film.

Bollywood !!!!

Show proper trailer of this film so know how is this film??

×0
Did not see no trailer of this film at all.

If replace Amirkhan as Shri Krishna.and give that role to Saurabh raj Jain.period.

But not Amirkhan as Shri Krishna.

Or Ritik Roshan as Shri Krishna or Nakul.

Yes in this film they should give Saurabh Raj Jain as Shri Krishna not Amirkhan.

we all know the story come to the point😏😏

Only hindu actor's boycott other communityWho took Aamir Khan to play the character of Shri Krishna? Never listen to him, what is the practice of our religion and what are the devotees living?
Ranveer kapoor also yaar
For the character of Arjuna🏹, actor Prabhas is perfect 🙏
By making Mahabharata, why should these Muslim Actors destroy their Dharm… why do they know the importance of Sanatani Dharm?🤦🤦🚩🚩🚩🚩
Change the amir khan character

In sab ko oford  karate karate rajamauli sir loss mein ho jayenge

I am looking forward to the release of this film. And hope that there is no change in the script of ancient Indian texts

Amazing h
Fake he yeh puri..... Editing ki hue he......Aesi nhi aayegi mahabharat.....Aur aayegi to mahabharat ko fir se apman krege yeh tv wale bhand

Pooja was best draupadi 😔😔😔😔🥳🥳🥳
Bagva's video
Now no one is asking the people of Bollywood, after being ruined themselves, now they have started ruining the South Film Industry. I don't know what happened to the people of South Film Industry, since when did these people start needing the donkeys of Bollywood.
Bakwaas
Please, just remember perfectly that Sourav Raj Jain and all the other stars of starplus mahabharata can never be replaced by Bollywood stars. Deepika as Draupadi?????? Just go to hell.

Ho ji ko hu hu hu hu 66666. Hi no no
Only shaukni has best role by gulshan grover, remaining I can&#39;t digest

In this the casting of Aamir Khan, Abhishek Bacchan and Farhan Akhtar is wrong.
Ramanand sagar mahabharat is best

If a jehadi wants to live in the country of India and a Hindu… it seems as if he will… make us Krishna… Hindus and Mahabharata are completely respected… Boycott This Movies… 👆👆👆🤨🤨🤨
Ram charan  ko sree krishna role dedo...

Amir Khan to sree krishna  ko bhi badnam karega ..By cut Amir Khan

Raja moli you are doing wrong casting.
Pls secular cerrecter ko garao

What is the use of Aamir or Farhaan Akhtar in the cause of this religion, where do those emoticons come from or pls Hindus know about Hindu religion.
Remember that this movie is based on Hindu force.
Aamir Khan would not have seen it at all because he is criticizing our Gods and Goddesses or how did he give his character? How did you know the value of our Sanskrit?
amir khan bring out loduchand
Who or whom should the role of Krishna be given to Aamir Khan?
Sourabh jain is the best for Vagoban Sri Krishna.

The film is going to be made in how many parts? Mahabharata cannot be shown in one part.
Super duper blockbuster   hoga ye movie, sab record tor dega,,,

Prabhas perfect ram
Nitish bhardwaj as krishna is all time best.

We should make clouds in the character of Shree Krishna and Arjun.
Amir Khan???

Star cast  pasand nahi aayi

Ramanand  sagar Ji se better koi nhi bana paya  Ramayana  ko..ussme  jo characters tha o sare the best <a href="">tha.no</a> one can make such kind of Ramayan till yet.....

Lid artist Thoda Milana Padega Sakuni Gulsan Kumar is perfect. And Bhishmapitam Amitab is safe and perfect.
Mahesh Babu ko Krishna ka kirdar Dena chahiye tha

There will be a flop...the one who has set his mind that everything will flop, the alliance will not continue.
Boycott

The role of Lord Krishna will not suit Amir.
Why did you keep this deepika bsdk
Whom does Amir Khan's second religious drinker worship, Amir Khan?
If Lord Shri Krishna's role will be played by Aamir Khan - the film will be a super flop.
Plz do such an insult, give Aamir khan the role of Lord Shri KARISHAN, this is an insult to God, give Aamir khan the role of Duryodhan, Dharitrashtra, Shakuni, my brother, please do like this, Aamir will play the role of Shri KARISHAN BHAGWAN. do......😰😰🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The role of Shri Krishna is Saurabh Raj Jain Sai.
arjun should be vidyut jamwal

Not good why use awer religion always it’s not good

What kind of hit will your film be? On one side you are making fun of Hindu Gods and Goddesses by making a film like PK or on the other side you want to show that Mahabharat is being made ((You have no interest in getting the Bhagavad Gita quote out of your mouth))) never. be hit
I did not want to watch this movie because I did not want to watch Krishna Bhagwan, Shourabh Jain, Aamir Khan, Shahrukh Khan or Salman Khan.
There is no one like Ramanand
Bheem as NTR and Arjun As prabhash Hona chahiye

Aamir as Lord Krishna, no way👎

Part 1 2 3 4 5 Make less and less....
amir khan is not fit, he is in the role of krishna ji, if you want to change then please do.
Shree Krishna's role should not be given to Aamir Khan..Saurabh Raj Jain should be given..because he is perfect..
Mahesh Babu will play the role of Krishna.
The role of Lord Shri Krishna should be made by some other actor and not by any Khan. 🙏🏻 Jai Shri Ram
Don&#39;t cast a white girl for Droupadi

Mullo ko leke movie bnaoge to wo flop he hogi

Amir Khan is not worthy....who comments on Hindu religion without knowing Hindu religion...PK is made....and then why today what do you want to prove by making Mahabharata...
This is the most powerful God of us Hindus<a href="">
Please don&#39;t take any khans

When movie will release

No to bollywood actors in mahabharat

Now in bollywood, no story has been found for the god, he has come to sell me or he has worked with south stars to get hit... South actors are very good among them or they are hard working too or these bollywood people have become corrupt like this. If you don't play this role in Bollywood, you would be better off playing the role of Shri Krishna, Salman Khan, I am the same, I don't want to be in any role at all, or Naa Hi Aamir Khan... even after making a movie, keep me away from this khan. from this he requested
very excited to see Mahabharata.

Saurabh raj jain is superbAur ye Amir Khan to shakuni ka character bhi deserve nhi krta 😆😆😆😆😆

Yes, this mullah will not suit Shri Krishna's character to Amir.
How could Krishna be created in this world?
Shree krishna role bht bdi bt h isme ye bewkuf sala aamir khaniya kregga to mahabharat why rangeela rasul m kro na role usme why mout aa jati h

Boycott this film, Aamir Khan should not be made Krishna, he does not want to accept India......! Boycott this propaganda film.
Ye kya 😟😟hum sahi to sun rahe 😟😟😟

No one likes a Mullah playing the role of a Hindu deity. They are charged in this country. It seems that those who make movies on insulting Hindu Gods, how did they remember today that they have to play a character in Mahabharata.
Arjun has not seen Fraha Khan
Aamir Khan should not play the role of Krishna, Aamir Khan is a shy cock sleeping in the morning
Bhisma pitama o Buddha ho gaya. A B jarror
No one can play the character of Krishna like Saurabh Raj Jain.
Aamir Khan will play the role of Akshay Kumar in the role of love Shri Krishna
When this realise

Ajay Devgan can do the role of Karna better.
Such people, who do not understand how to respect and honor women. He will play the role of my Kanha. Oh God, never forgive the one who criticizes you, Jai Shri Krishna.
I think prabhas is good for the role of karna

Ranveer Singh should be the first choice for the role of Arjun, secondary Ranbir Kapoor otherwise what is the point of watching the film.
We will never watch the film. We Hindus will never support those who present our culture as inferior material. I swear, boycott all my Sanatan Dharma protector Hindu brothers. Jai Shri Ram.🚩🙏🙏🙏🚩🚩
The role of every actor was not available... Arjun's role was to be given to Parbhas, Ajay was to be played by someone else, Amir was not playing the role of Krishna, it was played by someone else, Hrithik's role was also to be played differently. ...Let's see, we will find out.
The role krishna can be done by other actor. In my opinion Amir khan wont be good for the role. South star Allu Arjun could be a better option for Krishna role.

The main character has been given to those who consider the story of Mahabharata imaginary, it should be given to someone after knowing the character.
1.What you said is true because you did not want to commit every wrong act of Duryadhan. Due to his feelings, he became friends with Duryadhan and started his work. He was jealous of Arjun and Pandavas, they used Arjun's child's wisdom and knowledge of Sagittarius and he shook hands with Duryadhan and the doctor from Laksha Griha.. Draupadi. Vastra Haran.. Abhimanyu has not done the same number of deeds in the war, 1 time after killing Arjun, he had killed 12 vanesay, but Arjun was riding the wheel of the chariot which had fallen on the earth, but there was no bow in the hand. This story is 100% true in Mahabharata, it is not shown that if this truth comes to everyone then why did Arjun kill Nihatya and this Nara did not get defeated.
Aamir Khan Suna Khan Krishna Kasam trailer bhe nahi ga hum
By doing the work of Sri Krishna, the world will be blessed...Jai Jagannath 🙏
It is entire Mahabharata in one 3 hours film

That will be create history in Indian film industry

Farhan Arjun will not meet
Ashwathama ka roll kon krne wala hai

I was too exicted for this movie but When I saw that Amir Khan is playing the role of shree Krishna 👎 I&#39;ll give 0 star to this movie

this movie will flop 100%
The role of the gardener should be given to Souravraj, he has no one else in this world.
&quot;Pk&quot; I don't want to insult God, how can God be there in this movie?
All hindus, like Ajay devgan, Abhishek bacchan, hritik roshan in negative roles, and all muslims akhtar,amir as krishna and Arjuna, is the director mad??

Aamir Khan is not perfect for Sri Krishna but I thought it would be better if he played the role of Durydhan.
Ajay Devgan Krisna and Amir Khan Duryohan best kirdar
Saurabh raj Jain as Krishna

If any Muslim will be in a Khan film, then who will watch this film? If any Hindu will watch this movie, will Aamir Khan like making fun of God, will any Hindu watch this movie?
Link bejo

Shakuni's character is a good choice
Super

Overall ok but Sri Krishna Saurabh Jain &amp; Arjun character change
The role has been given to those who have no knowledge about religion.
Bloody K**n boycott this movie

No one could play the character of Bhim except super star Prabhas.
Kab Hoga Yeh Movies Release

Nice acting and casting sarvadaman D banarji

Khano mai khan irfan khan rest sub nakli imaan rest sub sub hai hai

Karna mahesh babu
How they complete full Mahabharat in 3 hours? It&#39;s insane. They should make it in franchise way

we don&#39;t want to see Amir khan as Krishna

The role of Shri Krishna ji should be given to a Hindu hero.
Bhai, everyone can take it but take it with Akshay Kumar…the film will flop…bollywood's Ajay Devgan, Hrithik Roshan, Sunny Deol, Vidhur Jamval…we can take it…and we can take Vivek Obroy in the role of Raavan.. .No other hero is a fool, he is for Mahabharat in Bollywood.
Take Aamir Khan out of the movie
Shri Krishna's height is not decreasing, whenever Muslim people come to insult Hindu people, we Hindu people have to tolerate insult.
Deepika times
Now all of them will also act in Mahabharat.
This film will not work. The director should think again.
Aamir Khan is not fit to play the role of Kirshna Bhagwan, he has banned Mobi
I don&#39;t think that it will be interesting

M sury puter karan. Who is my fan or me in his character Hrithik Krishan has reached his age ❤️❤️❤️
If this film is made then this 📽️ film will be SS Rajamouli's most flop film because it is a slap on the face of Hindus.
By making this film, the producer will go to hell.
flop jayegi puri movie
The screen cast of Bollywood is bad, but a role like Arjun, Farhan does not understand his dialogues, it would have been better to give a chance to new artists.

YASh

Amir Khan aur krishna ke roll me ham hindu dharm ke log isko boycott karenge

Very nice bs Arjun has full responsibility on us, it is a little difficult to name him Fran Akhtar or not.
THE BIG FLOP IS AWAITED.

The selection of actors is poor. It is important to what extent the director can make the actors act. Most of these actors cannot bring mythological characters to life. It is not right to cast a fraudster like Aamir in this.
We’ll be honest. We haven’t seen any of Vidyut’s movies to tell if he’s any good as an actor. But with his rock solid abs and fetching looks, he seems to be the right candidate to play the most handsome man in the Kuru lineage known for his sword fighting skills and diplomacy.

Can't wait ❣️ juldi releases karo
All the actors included
🤣🤣🤣😁😀😀 Then the end of Kaliyug will come soon.. please log in and do the action of gods and goddesses.
You guys have taken all the Duryodhan parties 😅
Pura pura ka Bollywood utha laye mouli saab,Jabki Bollywood byecut ki trend mein chal rha h.😂😂

Saurabh Jain should be given the role of Kishan.
Cut off Dropadi's breasts too.
Badon ka Mahabharat
Should not be watched

Bycote khan&#39;s family in our  Religion&#39;s film

Backwash

flop hai screen shot lelo bollywood full buttock
Prabhas ...🔥🔥🔥
Should Amir Khan be given another corrector, he is not perfect for Lord Krishna, PK who has made no effort to bring down Hindu religion, has made Amir Khan the leading actor for the first time.
Amir khan ko is film main jaga na de to accha hoga

Aamir Khan as shri krishna we can&#39;t see this

poori movie mulli movie hii
Those who praise God, the director is playing the role of Krishna and seems to have gone mad.
create hindu log
If you are making a movie then tell us no Muslim should make it.
You have made even a little with your mind, wah wah wah, you are doing the right thing 😡😡😡😡😡
Boycott Khan movie
This tingu bauna can&#39;t play the character of Shri krishna.and please choose a dark skinned actor for Shri Krishna role because Shri Krishna was dark skinned.

Aamir Khan should not get the role of Lord Shri Krishna.
But I want to see mahesh babu as krishnà

Yes Saurabh Raj Hain is perfect fir Shri Jrishna&#39;s role bot Amirkhan.

Aamir khan the Gaddar, as Krishna. Boycott !! Drop him or it will be a flop.

I&#39;m very worried how Amir Khan will give bhagwat Geeta Gyan to Farhan Akhtar who is Arjun 🤔😱😰

I don&#39;t understand why rajamouli sir not taking the most talented actor like Mr Saurabh Raj Jain or any other talented actor from south or anywhere else or any new Actor for Krishna role in what sense he has given this Krishna role to Amir Khan 🙏🙏

Draupadi's role was played by Deepika Padukone or Pooja Sharma.
When will this movie be released? Or did you give the download link of the movie?
No Muslim actor should be born alone, his brother will cry.

Shri Krishna ji's brother Saurav Raj can hinder him and Duryodhan's role video Ajay Devgan is not right Ajay Devgan ji is always considered a hero There is no need to make him a villain There is no need to make Mahabharat a khichdi
I’m so happy Deepika playing the rule I’m so so happy ❤️❤️🥺🥺
shree krishna should take Akshay Kumar or Hrithik
Arjun was not the companion of Shri Krishna… Shri Krishna had become the companion of Arjun.
Jai Shri Ram
Tiger Shroff should take it
100% super hit....
Saurabh Pandy has done a lot
Jai Shree Krishna Ram Bhagwan said Nath Bhagwan Hanuman ek dant maharaj
Kindly please don&#39;t take a khan&#39;s in  this movie other wise we will fire 🔥 all .......Request to please don&#39;t support other religions in Hindu gods movies

It is impossible for Aamir Khan to play the role of Lord Krishna. The best actor for the role of Lord Krishna can be Akshay Kumar in Bollywood. Raj Mouli ji should consider this.
Sree Krishna ka acting Hrithik ko dena chahiye tha.

nice

Abhuthanam of religion. Not of iniquityAdharmasya ka uthan nahi
The character of action will make the world worse.
Ranveer huda
Eklovya with banega
Muslims should not be kept in the holy book of Mahabharata.
If Amir Khan will be act character of Shree Krishna. Then this movie will be Super Flop😠

Arjun incarnation. give alu arjun a role for this
Koi nahi mila jo Amir Khan ko lord of Krishna ko Banna diye

Now Aamir Khan became the head of Krishna.
Ye vedio jo tum banaye ho ,(PR Bollywood)na Aise fake news banakar logo ke time waste karke tum pakka narak hi jaoge

Sir, I should not have taken it.....
Jai shree ram 🙏

Super

I find the casting is very poor.... Aamir Khan as Krishna and Farhan Akhtar as Arjun is the most stupid one. Don&#39;t know in what basis they done this. People of this country should protest this. Going to be a big flop as within 3 hrs it can&#39;t be describe.

If Mahabharat is made into a film then which Hindu will play the role of Shri Krishna in us?
The role of Lord Shri Krishna is that he can not become an admi, who says that a stone should not thirst, this is what is meant by Patthar, Shivling.
He is playing Arjun's character... what a joke.

Star plus Mahabharat is one of the best epic &amp; want to see Saurav Raj Jain as krishna again not Amir Khan

Flop hogi pakka.. write to Abbi 😁😆😆🤣🤣
Ajay Devgan sir's role as Arjun will remain true, I know that in Bhagat Singh role, Ajay Devgan's face is no less than Arjun's, he should be like a Bollywood actor.
It's a lie, they won't be artists.
This is not a movie, this is our cultural Geeta.
Only those men can act in this film who have never seen a woman. These film actors have done obscene scenes many times, that is why they should never be taken.
There should not be any film actor in this Mahabharata because Mahabharata is related to the Hindu religion Geeta which is an absolute truth. This film actor has played obscene characters in many films, hence I boycott this film.
I would never like to see Aamir Khan and Shahrukh Khan and even Salman Khan as Shri Krishna ji.
Who are non believer especially Hindu againster rolling important role it hurting the Hindu follower change Krishna acter, dhropathi, santhanu

Super se bhi upar my favourite roll creator Karn that&#39;s hirtk Roshan

akhchy Kumar is good for shree Krishna

Remove all khans from mahabharath

The role of even one of these actors is not as per his liking, think of making Aamir as Duryodhana and Ajay as Yudhishthir, Prabhas as Arjun and Ranbir as Dushashan, Farhan as Karna.
Why Amir Khan he always talk wrong about Hindu god

Nice editing
If you beat Aamir Khan in Mahabharat, even if you have to play the character of Shri Krishna, you will beat Shri Krishna because Shri Krishna is there in Mahabharat.
Amir Khan ko sra krishna kee kirder mat do
What work must have been done by one Bi Khan in this film? Our film should be scrutinized by every Hindu.
False news..!?
Super flop film ho ga
That's right, Amir Khan found out about Krishan's power.
Fek he ye

Krishan looks like Amair Khan's type.
Arjun's character seemed similar to Prabhas in a different way...
Mahesh babu honge is pe

Public did not boycott Bollywood, even did it, but now Bollywood people are enjoying in South movies, why don't you say something? Aamir Khan had said in an interview that I feel like living in India too. I don't even know about love, the one who has married ten times and married twice has given her the role of Krishna. Every time I decide, now Aamir Khan will join Mahabharat. Why will everyone cry against Annay today? Mahabharat is not a story, it is the history of India, religion has been established in Treta Yug, religion has been established in Dwapr Yug also, religion will be established in Kliyog also. We will have to continue our work.
Where does Lord Krishna teach Quran instead of Geeta?
Hrithik Roshan should play the role of Arjun. Farhan Akhtar should play the role of Karn.
Totally sucks

Most ache Krishna sarbadamana banarjee, ramanad sagar
Our star boys are very beautiful who are being cast in the movie hh🙏🙏♥️♥️
Amir khan is a wrong choice  for Krishna..a person who has no value for Bharath...what justification  he can do for this  greatvrole. It is very religious ...not for any commercial business..Saurabh was the best..for 100 more years...

When Mahabharata was first created for all of us children, it was fun to watch in our minds or now we have kept Sanskrit as a joke by changing it again and again. In order to earn money in Sanskrit, these people should not kill God. These people have said that in Kaliyug, money will be enough or in the name of money, these people will make fun of Maha Bharat, Krishna…like the Vedas. ..you should stop doing these things, always old is gold...
You are fooling, no movie is being made.
The characters of Arjun and Krishna should be played by someone else who can speak and explain Sanskrit well, because the verses of Geeta are not film dialogues, they are the feelings of the people, the essence of the entire creation. Those who do not believe in Krishna, they do not have feelings in it. What will you put?
The role of Duryodhan should be given to Ranveer Singh.
It is set to be the biggest flop movie of this year. How strange it is that people living in India feel that they are playing the role of Lord Shri Krishna…they need to become Shakuni.
Casting is wrong somewhere..... Like Amir as Shri Krishna, casting is wrong... Vidyut Jamwal or Ranveer Singh do not deserve Nakul or Sahadev..... Casting is not right anywhere.
Amir khan is jihadi ko role milega tho flop hogi yaha movie
Where is the trailer..?
Somodh pilgaunkar best rol krishna

Arjun
Super hit hoga

No one can beat star cast of ramand sgars mahabhart

Amir khan Krishna nhai bane g

I will definitely watch
I think Aamir is not able to play role of Lord Krishna pls get him out from movie

No, it will not hit. It will flop. Due to current affairs. So we should not use muslim actors in this movie. That&#39;s All. 👍

.....The most Powerful Role of Lord Krishna played by Mr.Saurabh Jain was Awesome and I always find lord Krishna in himAmir Khan never can beat Mr.Saurabh Jain but still it will decided by time when the movie will release......will add Comments that time

Saurav raj Jain ko Bhagwan shree Krishna ka rol do tabhi film chalega

An attempt to make Karan a hero is not being shown.
Bs tv serial ki trh mnghadnt story add na kre

When there is a Mahabharata movie, why is there a need to take Aamir Khan and Aadipurush Saif Ali Khan, without them the movie cannot be made.
The role of Lord Shri Krishna was not given to Aamir Khan. tea
Rana Daggubati should play the role of Bheem and Prabhash should play the role of Arjuna.
Yyy
Haha Amir Khan to muslim ha na ..Mahabharat ma Amir Khan
Change the Shri Krishna &amp; Arjun character &amp; the play of Shri Krishna &amp; Arjun character hindu heros

I can't believe when this film will be made and released Ram Jaane
Bakwaas
This is my personal view. Please dont feel offended. Aamir Khan and Farhan Akhtar should not have been given these important role.  It tough to digest them on those reel character as per their real life. With so many druggiwood big names in film, they might end up making a comedi movie. I wish, some how this film should never get released. I am surprised, sir Rajamouli has taken so many real life idiots in this film.

Aamir Khan will best play the role of Krishna👍👍👍👍
Bagban Krishna ka roll boo bee amir khan hamari puri family iss movie ko nahi dekey gee jai shri Ram

Very nice trailer

There is a good way to make a pussy..😅🤣
Bheema Character Prabhas Anna❤
Fake

Agar sach mein yah film release Ho Gai To Sare film record Tod De

I swear that because I have covered the Kashmir file, please do not invite even you people, remember that like Israel, I will not go to watch a movie and I will do more to create awareness among the people. Don't want to watch this Amir Khan movie. Remember it, brother. Learn from Israel. What happened, Rajamouli made this movie, in the next movie we will go to watch Rajamouli's movie twice in which he is not a Muslim.
Please boycott this movie. Because reaction aap log jante hai.isme sare muslim krishan arjun bane hai or bad roll me hindu hero ko .Samjo isko bhi logo

Hrithik Roshan is the best actor either in dance or in acting, he is also tall and tall in English, the role of Krish will look good or the role of Arjun or the role of Lord Mahadev in Mahabharat will also look good, or Akshay Kumar is also the best actor. Yes, he also liked all these roles because when Arjun leaves for heaven, he also danced there, so both these actors are good, according to me, the remaining one is Bhim's role, Sanjay Dat should get it because of his height. Achi hai or Sani Deol's role will be cast in Balram ji, please reach my post soon.
Khan will never be able to fulfill
Bakwas casting Kiya rajamouli ne

Shri Krishna ka character Aamir Khan Ko nahin Ritik Roshan ko Dena chahie tha

, If there is a good character, he will play a Muslim and if there is a bad character, he will not play a Hindu, this is how Bollywood Tollywood is.
Amir Khan is not selection for Mahabharat

Mahabharata is not a story 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Chal jhutti
Nitish Bhardwaj  the best as Krishna till now

Why did you take Aamir Khan for Mahabharat?
Ye to paka hhhh

Amir khan sri Krishna banege to film flop hoga

Flop movie you have
What do you think, this is so old, everyone knows that this film will not be a hit.
Ghatiha
sb comment me itna kyu pgla rhe hai pehle movie to aane do aane se pehle hi judge kyu kr rhe ho
This film does not play with history, which angel will Amir Khan use for KRISHN, which angel will Farhan Arjun use, and which Arjun's most capable Prabhas will use to make Bheem, the movie will flop.
Jay shree Krishna

This movie will be the best film not only in India but in the entire world. Historic 👍👍👍👍
Prabhas 🔥

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Fake

Everyone is trying to move this ban, there is nothing left, don't follow fake news😡
never banned mahabharat bollwbood mein 100/taka
Farhan will not play Arjun's role anymore
Aamir Khan can't play the role of Shri Krishna Bhagwaan. If you make fun of my God then this movie will not be watched.
Kankhadanda, the man who is anti-Hindu, who will play the role of Lord Shri Krishna? If this bastard Khan is removed, then the movie will be above super.
Nobody can role like Saurabh Jain, And I thought this will going to flop..

The role of Lord Shri Krishna should have been given to Saurabh Jain or someone else instead of Aamir Khan and someone else should have taken the role of Farhan Akhtar in the role of Arjun.
Khans in Mahabharat...is wrong
I&#39;m so excited 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Aamir Khan is not worthy of choosing any other actor for Sree Krishna ji.
Mat banaoo...amir khan as krishna nahi chahiye
Karna as a prabhas alredy told rajamouli

Krishna and Arjun's role was wrong. Krishna's role was not Hrithik's, Ajay's role was, Arjun's role was Ranveer Singh's.
Rajnouli ji. .  avoid khans in your movies otherwise nuksaan hoga. Guys avoid watching this movie Just to boycott khans and some other nepotism of bollywood

No way to this Mahabharata..... Muslims hain ismein. Avoid watching this movie

Amir played the role of Krishna, he did the drama in PK movie, which came here too 😏😏😏😏
I will not see if <a href="">#Intolerant</a> Amir khan will be select as KrishnaMahesh Babu- KrishnaAkshay Kumar- ArjunPrabhas- BhimAjay devagan- YudhishthirAmitab bachchan- BhishmAmir Khan(Thag)- ShakuniSaif ali khan- Ashwasthama

This <a href="">#Chutiya</a> cast should not be the part of Bhahabharat star cast.. please select South Indian Star&#39;s for Star cast... and these anti national bollywood <a href="">#Chutiyans</a> as negative character... 🙏🙏🙏

I hate Amir khan as a Krishna... Intolerant guy would not be the part of Pandav , Krishna, Karn and Bhishma.. Deepika Padukon also would not be as Draupadi..???

I like to act as karna😡

Wait only, where did the trailer show mc bc kahinki
If you meet Muslim people like Amir Khan and Farhan Akhtar, you will find people like him in such movies, who will also like to do this, when will you meet Amir Farhan?
There is no trailer..the trailer is stuck on the bolts.
It&#39;s good that film Industry has taken some intrest in showing Hindu epics to Hindustani. I don&#39;t know about star cast but as it is made by Rajamouli Sir so it should showing some good effects. but as said main saransh is to show Geeta updesh. Hope it is done well.. Rest is ok

Bollywood actor and actress hai to flop to hogaa bai

By changing Hrithik
This violent actor is being given the role of Krishna. very shameful
After Lord Krishna no one was born better than Saurabh Jain.
Mahabharat All ready watch in TV no one beat

Why do Bollywood people indulge in nepotism, otherwise one day such a time will come when people will not like to watch even Tollywood because these Bollywood people keep spreading their filth wherever they go.
Apart from Sardman Banerjee, no one else fits the role of Shri Krishna.
Nahi chalegi boycott... this movie

The role of Lord Shri Krishna should not be given to Aamir Khan but should be given to a cultured artist like Mahesh Babu.
Andhbhakta chu log taang taang aateane he honge ।
Sanjay Dutt vs Bheema
we want this movie to be made
Aamir as Krisha..!! hard to digest.. Take someone who is tall enough and with good vocals.. Saurabh jain is all time best actor for this role..

Draupadi lovely lovely gaye gi ya dum maro dum
Kiara advani is best for draupadi not druggie alian

Who insulted Hindu Gods and Goddesses, how can he do this role?
This actor don&#39;t even know value of mahabharat. It is not proper.

Buddha Amir hee Mila Aapko…ye toe had hai…Bahut se talented actor jate jaate…like Nitish Bhardwaj.
Mulla kyu h isme
Nahi aayega
Yah mahabarat nahi chalega rajamoli ji aap saath film saath star or no one else
It would be very wrong to show a Jehadi as Krishna.
Upni bakwas bnd kr ullu ki patti

Ssrajamoli sir did not take any V actor of Bollywood at one time to make fun of Bollywood today pasiya kamna chata hai from south movie
In Mahabhata, no place is seen as God.
Fok

akhsoy kumar who is the best
And we will not accept Amir Khan as krishna

Love Hrithik Roshan
Can&#39;t wait for this movie 🔥🔥💯💯

Tell me when this movie will be released
60%STAR CAST IS WRONG FROM BOLLYWOOD SPECIALLY WHO IS PLAYING THE ROLE OF SHRI KRISHNA

Jitne sare actor hai sabhi ke sabhi faltu hai is mahabharat movi ke liya😡 bas ek do ko chur ker....jaise prabhas, Amitavh, arjun rampal,ajay debgan

Brother, how can a human being who insults God in PK play the incarnation of Krishna?
In Mahabart, Muslims are not wanted, brother, you will become a Hindu.
Rajmoli sir in this film take only south actor and actress , not to bollywoods bhand and harami

The one who does not know about our religion will play the role of Lord Shri Krishna, you bastard Bollywoodiya.
Who are you listening to since Diwali 2018?
What is the talent of Aamir Khan to play the role of Lord Krishna?
Yes

Boycott Bollywood

None of the actors or producers can match the cast characters and Mahabharat made by Ramanand Sagar. His was an excellent piece of creation.

Super duper hit hoga fd
Why did the Bollywood artists take it?
I am so excited for this ❤️

How many views did Lia get?
There is no need to wear clothes, Deepika has dropped it. Vista dalegi to na.
Bollywood actors will flop the film
If you want to see a Muslim actor in this movie then I will not be able to see him in this movie.
Very nice so much

And especially Aamir Khan will not agree with Krishna at all.
Look, if South people make a movie with Bollywood, I will stop watching South movies too.
All the dirty people are making films.
You are doing wrong by making this film🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
The role of Lord Krishna should have been given to Mahesh Babu in Mahabharat by Raja Mali sir.
Bollywood people have to make comedy, there is no need to make Mahabharat a comedy.
Where can Shri Krishna do this? To save the Bagwat Gita from being defamed in the future, if you ask who is Karshna, then you will say where Shri Krishna is,,,,
Aamir Khan in Krishna Karol does not suit
Krishna... Hrithik Roshan..srDropadi...dipikapdukoniDuryodhana..ajayidevagan..srArjun..shahidh kapoor...srShushasan... Abhishek Bachchan..srBhima...prabaas..srJayadrath...jhaan abram ..srPaandu .... ranabir.kapoor..srNakula.... Siddarth.monothra...Sahadeva......ranavir singDarmaraaya... viduth..srDushasan..
Remove those Bollywood heroes who make fun of Hindus by calling them 'bara bhula'.
What nonsense? Since last 3-4 years he has been watching only on YouTube. It doesn't have any trailer. Where are the useless logs coming from and how to make such videos?
Yes this movie goes to superhit

Intresting dekhenge current time acting vs old
Prabhash

Hail lord krishna
mahabharat plz relish
boycott this mahabharata
we don't want muslim krishna
Fake news

Star cast is not acceptable ...low rated star cast for Mahabharat ....Aamir looks Shakuni but casted as Krishna ....we can love another women as our mother but not more than our real mother same as  new movie on Mahabharat  and BR Chopra&#39;s Mahabharat ❤️❤️

This is fake

Amir khan ko nahi Lena chaiye tha
