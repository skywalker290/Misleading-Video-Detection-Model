This live is so good

I&#39;m of a dark complexion, my family doesn&#39;t mind it, but i do mind it very much. No matter how much people say that they aren&#39;t racist, but most people judge people by their skin colour, this is the sad reality of today 

Sir Hindu Muslim is not in Pakistan Bangladesh what all these things are in ???????Gujarat Godhra Kanhaiyalal. Rathore. According to PFI, 2047 documents, everything is clear that my Abdul is not like the one who eats his hair because of his Abdul, ok sir???

Anyone from 2022 

what is cooked
Faced this racism <a href="">3:23</a> When you said about this tears were rolling down my face

Okl

Oh my ideal 
You are one of the best person I have seen in my life 

U r great

I am telling you the truth, those people are fools who keep watching memes or useless things.. If one's mind is right then no matter what the age, one has to be mature if one has the courage to stay with wrong things or people.. Or if you don't know the truth that what is happening to you is wrong... then you understand what is wrong and what is not.... those people should not do these things to others. I hate FB i just use insta to help ppl jinke with discriminate hora h or depress h log nd also bcz of my Artwork.Nd i met some amazingg ppl who rrally r blessings good pure heart .. Whether they are from india or other country se.They also help a lot to build I have to learn to understand people or even understand myself. And no one is more important than me to understand myself. I have to understand my family even when someone discriminates in front of me. Whatever caste color of religion you love, whatever is your religion, here is the log church, new temple, new gods are there. Method to earn money. Keep it in your heart, believe in yourself, take care of yourself, don't forget to inspire others. If only you would be able to build a house or feed others, how much happiness you would feel. If you accept the mistake, then you will only get help. Or support someone in this. This should not happen either.
People don't understand whether it is a color or a shape... with time everything changes and nothing will stop, according to time human nature changes everything.. or a human will die because of the color size cast. There is no cure. To do this torture one must do it mentally whether one is human or one is animals. Human beings have just seen the offer. These people neither live by chains nor give life to others. These people have no unity among them and they are the ones who are the most advanced in pointing fingers. Therefore, no matter where or what you see, the finger is not pointed at what is wrong. Aunty uncle did special things...she did not get any sanskar from those people.
In school life home relatives alllll fake ppl. Did this but i like my brown gold color nd thanks to God i dnt meet those ppl who discriminate others bcz of anythg like this.

Merko bi kala bndar chida the hai

A raha hai bah sir legend is not back but kuch bi nehi

I always gone through this situations depressed so many times but now I always remember one thing that who&#39;s talking about me anything bad it&#39;s his/her thoughts.. and being alone is better than friends like this.. so I&#39;m happy 

Bhuvan Bhai, once I was traveling in a train with my parents and there were trans standing in front of me and in my mind, I said who are these people, why are they dressed like this and all of that, now I realize that I was wrong and that I should not judge someone

India is the most racist country

<b>Indians are very self hating people so I avoid them. I&#39;ve suffered a lot of REVERSE DISCRIMINATION.</b>

<b>Europhilia.</b>

That&#39;s why we like him  hats off to him

Proud of you Bhuvan .

Hi bro

When I was in 8th standard my Geography teacher humiliated me  for my darker skin tone.She was was talking about  how South Indian  Tamilians are dark skinned  and immediately pointed towards me in front of the whole class and said (&quot;Look that boy is an example of a south Indian&quot;)

I was just 13 at that time I felt insecure at that moment  all my friends were laughing at me it shattered my self esteem.Except this incident  my classmates already used to make fun of me and look down on me .Those regular mockery and insults during my childhood made me an introvert and less confident , social person .Now I am  20 year old and  still my communication skills aren&#39;t good  I don&#39;t have any friends and  I get bullied daily in my College .

Jo log languages k base pe logon ko judge krtay hai vo mujhe bilkul bhi achay nhi lgtay.

There is a shortage of media to brainwash people‚Ä¶..making breaking news without reason and popularity. Karna chahte hai apna....Don't listen to media.....always listen to those who gives you right informations like bb bhai ....
Now I am knowing the real BB 

Ap jaysa v ho bohot accha ho bb i love you

Hello

Hello

Real  viewers are hare in this good videos of BB

This is indeed True I have seen many couples where one is obese and other fitOne with dusky complexion and other with fair and there are many more comparisons that comment section will turn small for this.So here if the woman is having any of this societies so called negative traits then that couple life becomes hell, and sometimes because of this f*cking so called society their marriage comes to an end

Hlo brother

He is talented g.o.a.t

bb was trying to change the whole nation in the right direction

EXCELLENT WORK 
My skin is brown and I get comments for that ..And at one point of time, I felt rlly sad, but I hv started to love myself for who I amSelf acceptance is rlly important, and yes, all skin colour is beautiful

I m gonna turn 18 in 2022 but still I m getting taunts from family n friends..

Bas haste rho tension mat liya karo kyuki zindagi bohot precious hain be happy be positive..

If any fair complexion person come and tells me that my skin is not fare, I would tell them if you believe that God made us, then he forgot to add colour while he made you.No offense but if someone passes racist comments to me, I will have to fight for my self, only by my voice.

4 years ago... I was not accepted by a boy because of his dusky complexion... I was single or had never been in a relationship before.. That was the first boy who liked me a lot... I put in a lot of efforts but my mind set was that I should enjoy my first relationship with a handsome or cool guy... But my boy did not give me anyone's love... I did not use much effort today. I made you my fiance.... Love you Shekhar. You made me realize the real meaning of love.

You are awesome Bhai, ek Dil hai kitni baar jeethogeÔ∏è.. you had put clear picture of our society, your words might effect the thinking of our society. Good start Bhai, do these things frequently.

And  we  don&#39;t  care  what  they  think  of  us  as  these  things  signify  their    personality   and God looks  everything  as  I  am northeast

Bro  your  words   touched  by  soul  and  we  face  these  problem  still  .people  still  stare  us  too  much  and  make  us  realize that  we  are  not  like  them  and  thanks  for  talking  in  this  topic  

 we are discriminated in Goa on basis from where we have come were we were born religion yar please don&#39;t hesitate to stand up for your rights The sad truth of Goa is discrimination of Indian tourist

Im not obsessed with fair skin.... But in obsessed with clear skin not matter how skin color is

My mom says not to buy a black dress cause im dark so i wouldn&#39;t look good. My sister is fair like my mom and i am like my dad it makes me feel sad tho-

<a href="">2:16</a>This u must find something small, but discouraging someone continuously for a fat body is very painfulEven the teachers do body shaming, I hate thisNobody should care about, how I look, what is my current bg,I need  this to be stopped, cuz I don&#39;t spend there money, there money is not used to make me fat, so shut the f upand also, not related to meBut those who think that being transgender, gay, lesbian, or any other person who come in the category of LGBTQIA+ is something very offensive, change ur thoughts until it&#39;s too late, and I would like to thank and appreciate Bhuvan sur for bringing social topics in ur videos also, I respect the society but not there stupid rules and limitations which discriminate othersThanks

Love u BB for this vdo

From this to the brand ambassador of myntra This called struggle and success

This the reason why I love Bhuvan

I have dark complexion but not too dark only few guys made fun of me.There was an hindi story in my school called Kallu Kumhar after then they named in Kallu. But I never mind because they were my friends and i could also make fun of them. But if some elder or relative make fun of color thats bad. It never happened to me.

Amazing video sir
3 years ago we found out that corona will happen in 2020
The quality is best

this guy is an true inspiration love you soo much big fan.

I am puzzled as to why is it racist to call a Black Guy Black but calling a White guy White isn&#39;t..???

how is your health
Brother, there are a lot of women who are batting a lot, very good. Everyone should think like this.
Recommend after 3 years

I have a Muslim frnd and he very kind person.But actually the truth is k kisi ek person k vajah se Puri com Ko shayad bhura mana Jata h. Bus log sunte h or yakin kar lete h that sit baki sach to ye h ki sab log Badal re h or miljhul k rehte so bus kuch logo k vajah se kuch khrab soch kuch logo ki uski vajah se sab log ESA soch te h

Surely, this guy has got something. You are made to achieve something more than what you already have had.I just know one thing. Only a few people cannot actually make a difference in this Racistic view with which Indians judge everyone.Chahe kitni bhi Western movies dekh lein.. dimaag aaj bhi peeche h aur mujhe toh lgta h future me bhi peeche hi rahega.And hence, the best thing about outsiders(people outside of India-non Indians), like MCU-DC movie producers, actors, co-actors, they don&#39;t fucking care about if the person working with them is brunette, blonde, or even warm brunette. Why can we not move ahead of this racism, guys!?Some Asians think that skin color describes person&#39;s status and background, as per what I have read.. mtlb kisaan ka baccha gira hoga toh kya wo kisaan ka baccha nhi hoga. Aur Ambani ko toh jante hi nahi honge ye log. Aur English se toh hadd ka obsession h.. mtlb ek ne boli nahi to bol denge English nhi aati kya.. fir angrezi me baat krein toh.. apne aap ko jyada oversmart ban rhi ho.. SAHI HAI MTLB.So, this is a basic thing jo hum tak bhi humare parents se hi aati h.. agr tum badalna chahte ho toh bdlo na yrr.. Where IS the problem!?Haan, and i would even say I&#39;m an Indian, and I have got no problem agr log mujhe Priya Prakash Varrier aur Zendaya se compare krte hn.. han yrr me wesi dikhti hu to kya.. DIKKAT KAHAN H!?‚ÄçÔ∏è‚ÄçÔ∏èAnd yep, I don&#39;t fucking need likes.. kahan le jaungi rkh kr.. thoughts likhne ka shauk h bas mann kiya likh di.

These are the reasons why India is still considered as a developing country....not a developed country

Dear friend, you are the best..

2 years ago, my teacher told me in front of the class that he was a dirty food. It hurt me so much that I asked him why. I thought whether the teacher is God or not.


<a href="">15:05</a>Mere school me teachers bol bol kar thak gaye ki talk in english talk in english par koi english bolta hi nahi tha 

I watch vedio in 2020 oh yea

What a good topic is being raised...I am the first one to make fun of people when I come to my mind, I am ashamed of myself that why did I speak like this to whom and how did I speak...what a big mistake I have made at that time but only. No one among my friends or family has the courage to say anything wrong in front of me... or my family member is like this, all my friends are not there but now even they have understood that they are wrong.

The real truth is whoever is saying that fairness doesn&#39;t matter only heart mattersThey are mocking people nowadaysJo bhi ye gyaan chod rahe hai ki black life matters wahi aaj bhi dosro ko chidate h Real truth hai kadwa lagega

no one is born ugly we just live in a judgemental society                                                               - THE NEXT president                                                                      RMYES i am army and fanboy too

right bro
I started watching your videos 15 days before...becoz I was little upset with my life.. though thoda mood change karte hain... but day by day...I felt that you are not only a you Tuber but also a great personality with broad vision...so keep on watching about you.. about your tours.. about your programs etc..I can see you will be a great personality...to whom people can proud..And I am the first one...I feel proud that we have a youth in India like YOU.... like BHUVAN... love you..

&quot;Jo insan mazhab/dharam ki base per discrimination ya extremism phelata he wo na to muslim he na hindu ,christian etc,wo sirf aik extremist he .Me aik muslim hun and its a releif from me to hear from someone the TRUTH .Muslims and Hindus have been living in the subcontinent for centuries and celebrating each others&#39; rites and relegious activities. India is a great democracy no doubt and its a fact k ladai musalmono aur hindus ki nai he .kuch agencies he jo apna matlab nikalne k lie religion card play kar rhe hn and most of the people are aware from it .I hope that extremism in every shape should be condemned by everyone whether its class discrimination or communal voilence.

Brother Corona has happened sorry BHUBAN
At the time we go to school with the knowledge we also learn racism. And we learn this not from our friends but from our teachers only

Just look at the post of Ram Mandir and find out how many friends he has left.

Hi bhuvan i m frm northeast Assam n i love ur videos...
Bro please get  once again live please 

Most of the things you said are so normalized in our culture and we hear it so much as kids that we accept it without realizing how wrong it is. Rightly said that as adults we can change it and correct our ways...

When i was a child i had dark complexion and got many taunts from only family. They didnt even want to play with me

I have a tanned complexion. I had a friend who&#39;s basically a piece of shit in school,she said to me that my complexion is not good and she&#39;s fair as hell though she was just 2 shades lighter than me.

Okay so I don&#39;t know if the comments are still active or not but here my story :One time I was having my lunch and he said,&quot; there is no one in this house who&#39;s black like you ! &quot; Another time this happened . It happened at my grandparents house. My cousins literally compared perticularly my skin colour to theirs.What you read in the first para , it&#39;s actually my dad , just so you all know.

Can I do it with you sir?
Who else is watching this when fair and lovely change the name to glow and lovely because of discrimination

North Eastern dark skinned girl hima das is now proud of India, world champion

India is a country which has lots of obsession factors....on basis of skin colour, caste, culture, language....And we think that we could be Super Power one day. but i don&#39;t think so it would appear if we&#39;d still obsessed.This is sad but truth fucking reality.

So true I don&#39;t know why but I started sobbing prior to watching this video (only by seeing the title ) just becoz that&#39;s so much relatable to me . I was always bullied during my childhood  as kaali bhoot , chudail , kali kaluti , u don&#39;t look gud in light colours..  My world was just confined to me being an introvert which was rooted to inferiority complex consequently arised from what society threw upon me . Bt now I just contemplate why do u even have to give a shit to people they always have n will continue to disregard u so Live according to ur wishes n boom i wear every possible colour.. never apply our so called discriminatory cream fair n lovely . I feel confident more than before n lovely myself Ô∏è‚ÄçÔ∏è

whose watching this in 2020

Love you dada 
ever applicable video nothing has changed over the years and will never change.

Yes

Ues

I am a brown girl and I have faced a lot of discrimination
1 number bhai is very good, it is true.
Today I am remembering this videoWhen the whole world is acknowledging for black lives which you asked our people to follow way before.

U have the guts to discuss abt real things which other social media influencers try to avoid fearing losing subscribers or consider them not appealing to their group of subscribers. Ur responsible attitude made me subscribe ur channel today. Ur honesty reflects in ur eyes!! Much respect bro and bestest of luck for ur career!!

Hi

I have fair complexion but I think complexion is not matter Your way of talking,mindset, intelligence,behave and treat nicely with othets and so on. These things matter alot in any person male or female Need to change mindset related to skin complexion

Brother also spoke on body shaming
Bhai but dusre desh bhi koi sudhre hue nahi h. US mein to weight ko leke bahot mazaak udate h. N ageing ko lekr bhi. Sb bakwas h.

If only everyone becomes like him.

sir ap bth acha samjhate ho...I am really inspired by your words...nd always I watch this vedio  nd also show everyone

Guess what, mere bade Bhai ne 2 saal pehle hi live aake bol Diya tha &quot;Please no racism&quot;

All of this is so true. Its high time that we stop discrimating people on the way they look, their religions and start appreciating the inner person. It&#39;s the youth which has the power to stop all this bullshit and also its our responsibility that we stop people who are bullshitting stuff then and there because these petit things like teasing lead to big and severe mental issues.  If each one of does their own part of not discriminating and stopping the people who are discrimating we can surely get through this and pave our way towards the actual development!!!

Hi

Bhuvan bhaiyya, I have seen your videos for the first time and I am your fan. I have inspired myself to make videos like you and uploaded them on my friend's channel. I have learned your mimicry. Bhuvan bhaiyya, you are my idol. I have a request from my dear friend, I want to meet you once, this is the only time.
But it&#39;s more in North states like Delhi Yaha aapse face Dekh Kar bat ki jaati hai. But yes I live in East Delhi from approx. 24 years &amp; Yaha Sab Tarah ke community ke log hai lekin ESA unsafe Kabhi ni lga

This thinking can&#39;t be changed it&#39;s just come naturally from within you ki aap is Tarah se judge na Kare Kisi ko bhi it&#39;s take some time to understand anybody so don&#39;t make it a priority ki vo Acha ni dikhta to vo Acha ni h

Hlw bro

I just want to say god bless you

Mujhe ye insan acha lgta h youtuber to h hi badia pr insan kmal ho ap islie fan hu 
Ab btao ye muslims ko dekhne ka nazariya unhone hi create kiya haiAur honestly mujhe muslims se koi prob. Nhi hai per unke karan hi ab carodon log dikkat mein pad gye hai Just think

Brother, I am the creator of the difference between Hindu and Muslim, if you see nowadays, Muslims are being treated unfairly, brother, they are changing or creating our perspective. Why don't they stay at home? Corona is being eradicated in India but these Muslims don't care. Nowadays every child knows that because of Muslims this deadly disease is spreading.
Love you bhuvan bam
You are awesome dude

Brother you are great, God bless you.

Thank you sir.Thank you so much.I never thought that because of one joke of mine, someone would be hurt so much, someone would be going into depression.Today I felt very ashamed of myself after listening to you.Now I Who will use it or who will use it?

I have been directly or indirectly targeted for the way I look as it does  not fit the &quot;societal beauty standards&quot;. But the worst of all happened in college. I have been a very studious student, always having good grades but once in my college,  there was a research paper project, we had to work under a proffersor, my topic and the initial work that I had done was better than the rest participants but still the HOD of our department selected another girl because she was fair and beautiful than me(and my HOD was obsessed with fair skin). Though I worked under another proffersor and won the competition for my class but still that incident was the most piercing because my academics were the only thing I was never judged for the way I look, my brain and my thoughts represented me. But that day it hurt me so much.

Corona virus
Even this is not good but the video quality is poor.
Like karo Jo is video ko 1 bar dekh raha hai

Bhagwaan Krishna bhi dark the.Raat ke andhere mein hum sab dark hain.Aur kya chahiye? To all who discriminate people on skin colour which is as normal as us drinking water, ABBEY SAALE!!!

I have a pillow exactly like yours.
Wow! There are Indian BOYS also who are upset with the fair skinned boy obsession and here I am.I have taken far too much shit from darker skinned(especially caramel skinned) Indian boys,tolerated their rudeness etc. only because I long for tan skinned guys over pale guys ‚ÄçÔ∏è

Please share my story that my classmates played a game which was Sameer Touch in who I was treated as a untouchable and now I am suffering from depression can you advise a sollution

I noticed your interview with someone jahaan aapke saath Aditya Roy Kapoor the.. and he was like flaunting his English .. as in he felt some &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;... And you kept speaking Hindi... And trust me, you really looked and behaved in a far more better way than the Bollywood actor Aditya Roy Kapoor.. &quot;Originality is always beautiful&quot; you proved it .. God bless you ..

there is dust in my mind
This video is so relevant even today. What you said from <a href="">9:18</a> is what is going on right now. More power to you!

4.1K dislikes what did you do brother.....
Hi bb
one day i remmered that my behavior with was good  with teacher but some time teacher

Low quality hai

Bhai mai goora hu isliye mujhe angrage bulate

poorwaj were not bewakoof............you are not right there......mana unka nazariya galat tha ,and they were not developed as we are today ..but we should respect them because aj ham jo bhi hai unki badolat hai..otherwise, bb you are superb ...keep it up bro...

It might be mainly people of around 27 and above who discriminate so then maybe in 2040 discrimination will be almost eradicatedhope this is true

Ap ne bhot theek bola me so ke saat hu

Bhuvan let me share with you what i think causes people to think this way on subconscious level. When you play will you choose a fat one? Most probably not. Why? Cause u hate him? No.   Cause you know fat is unhealthy. That fat person will not be able to run as well. So wo banda to reh gya na hamesha ke liye disqualified?  Tell me how to change this cause i don&#39;t  know how. People will want to win always and they cannot by choosing fat people. They need fit people who will win them trophy.  Can you see the trap?   Toh kya karein? Khelna bandh kar de?When you stay outside and work under the sun it&#39;s  only natural that your skin will be dark. So it&#39;s  natural to assume  that fair skin means he comes from a good background, wealthy family.  Right?  I understand that hating and making fun for this simple  thingz is backward thinking.  I try my best to avoid doing this to anyone. But mein aap se puchta hu aap keise expect kar sakhte ho ke ye saab baandh ho jaye?    Agar healthy rehna sahi hein to log to healthy and good looking people hi first choose karenge na? Is ko hum galat keise bole batao?  Aur jab wo mota kala banda first look me reject ho gaya to harbar to wo looser hi huwa na?    Is mein aap keise isko galat bologe batao?   Change to tabhi ayega jab hum ise jhar se tor saake? Warna ye sirf kitabo mein hi sahi hein. Hum aur aap kuch nehi badal sakhte.

He is a true influencer...hats off

Hey, did anyone's eyes fall on my brother?
Awesome bhai

How the hack you got my Pillow cover 

Bhai BB tujhe hum logka fair skin ko leke itna chinta hai toh khudki ke liye ek gora gf kiyou nhi dhound leta. Pasand karega kya

Very nice topic sir.When I was in 12 in previous year I had experience one problem which I think is everywhere is that if someone is  paying for anything then we are overusing that thing. For ex. in school many classmates leave all the fan open and leave the tap water running when they are not in use. Because they think that they are paying for it.

Dislike karne wale sab wohe cutiya hai

But, one more thing, you know Americans stereotype Indians in a particular. Many of them think all Indians are Hindus and vegan.

You look like my boyfriend i can&#39;t stop staring at you in shoock 
We love you BB !Ô∏è

Bhai ap ka society ko dekhneka nazariya bohot accha.u are always osm.I have many freinds of many religion.we always live together and agar kuch panga ho jata hai to ham sab ek ho jate hai.but i want to say one thing today to u that in my class also there is a boy named harsh jise puri class mazak bana ti hai ki , kalu,kalua,kaua etc and main bhi dosto ke sath hasta tha but after wathching this vedio mai ye galti kabhi nhi kroonga.and i am sorry for that.i am in class 8 now plzz reply me atleast with just hii i am ur great fan.Ô∏èÔ∏è

Kash sb ki thinking ap ke jesi hoti BB I am proud of you

I&#39;m from Northeast India and thank you so much BB for highlighting discriminal facts about us. We face this problem a lot and I think your channel is a great platform to showcase discriminal, racial and other bizarre issues. Once again, Thank you so much 

Okay, I watched this video till the end and I totally agree with BB, but something that I wish to point out is the existence of discrimination on the basis of Religion/Castes. Yes, they do exist and on a larger basis than what is shown in Medias of any sort. But in different forms. They won&#39;t come at you directly abusing you for your caste or religion, but at some point in time, they definitely will blame you, take a jab at you for all the problems. These problems are COMMON even TODAY in almost every goddamn village of India. And if there are people who might see this comment of mine and say &#39;wo to villages ki problem hai; waha ke to log itne educated hai nhi&#39; to lemme tell you, India is made up of villages. Villages, rural community, even if don&#39;t accept it, are the life and blood of this nation. So my point-yes, these discriminations do happen, in a manner not visible to every eye. And I&#39;m not favouring these incidents in any way; nope. But we keep turning a blind eye to the minimal form of these problems, it won&#39;t be a long time when they lead to us wars among ourselves.

Love you 3000

Where do you speak, you are my favorite.
Since childhood, today till today, I have heard a lot of comments about skin color because I am the main father, in childhood, I did not come to this society and my teachers behaved like this, why do they behave like this and keep me for 45 minutes? And comparing her with me and feeling ashamed because she was fairer than me, I used to speak to the rest of the class, when she topped me in the class, then gradually society started thinking that this behavior was bad for my complexion. My face was very squeaky but I tried very hard to be fair but like you said my complexion never changed, I am still pale and now everyone is calling my beauty as dusky beauty. Everyone praises me, how beautiful a girl I am, but today even in one sentence I feel that if she was fair then what would she look like, but whenever someone makes fun of myself and my complexion, I stand by it. I used to talk to people in front of me, but some people themselves make fun of my complexion, how can I change my mind, I still don't understand...
Hi

Bhai thake hui lag rahe ho

I am a Muslim. In our religion we are taught equality, not abusing, not killing, not stealing, not allowed to tease neighbours in any way, no alcohol. We are taught to be good with everyone. We are united.

Bro picture quality is not more than 240p 
Thank you I just came across this video. My own church pastor sent me beautify video tip to have fair skin disgusting. I believe in Jesus but I dispose such preachers and people who discriminate on skin or look down upon

In India if u r dark u r ugly ,if u r girl and born in India ,skin colour really matters ,,really very very sad truth

Vedio quality is very bad

This year bhuvan bam has happened with MRE
A friend of mine is telling me why his mother went to Nepal or he was born after 9 months. Or he is not able to meet his father so we are telling him why.  but after see this vedio I stop saying him momos But it is quite funny...
Mother, why did you kill me ?
you caste the soil gaye
I&#39;m assuming you are 22-23 years old. At 46, i could be ur dad. Xlnt msg you are sending across. Not only are ur videos hilarious, but such small videos in between have the power to change the soch of aak ki youth. Hats of Bam. Whenever anyone is sad or worried or depressed, just have to hit one episode BB ki Vines and sab pareshaniyan door ho jata hai. keep it up beta....aur jug jug jiyo. Sorry about my Hindi...I&#39;m Tamil....    :D

I am 22 .and i just realized ki yeh baat to sach main galat hain aaj tak dhyan nahi di ki koi kisi ko kuch v bol k chida raha  hain but ab se sach main i will take a stand

I live in Dubai and I have 1 Pakistani friend who calls me kaale

Yes brother, I want to do one thing. Same thing happened in my life too, when I was in school, my friends used to tease me for saying that I did not fit in the society. Why did Bullet hurt me and told them? What good do I feel that there is no such society here, if I am feeling very guilty in all my class then now by hitting the bullet all the girls are also logged in and you all are feeling very guilty, then one day I thought that I will tell you. How much do I have to say, but the current situation is like this, but what I told you is that today we are in a bad condition, I don't know everything, what is the lamp of the society, and I want to say one thing, you will never be sad if you scold everyone. You think from where are you listening, from where are you coming out, it is like you have to say the words, come one day, one day, you too will remain silent, how much will you say, this is what I said today
Jo bhi kaha sahi Kaha lekin itne modern hone k bad bhi logo ki y mentality nhi badli ha boy with dark complexion is accepted in the society but what about a dark girl...

Great msg bhaii

Really tnxx bro bb

Today I have understood everything that you should enjoy life.

Respect man

Bhai really, this is a very nice video. I just love the topic that you took up. this is really a very ruthless obsession with fair skin. it is truly bad to see south-east Asians doing this discrimination. hats off to you bb for taking up such topic.

BB tu great hai some people will never change my urdu teacher who is more the 60 but still says tu kala hai yeh mota hai and i hate him and you are right love from pakistan

Relatives come to me and sing my songs and they talk about me being black and they are so angry that they want to kill me.
i love u bb
Sir Just to correct you , hamare purvaj bevkoof nahi the balki KUCH purvaj bevkoof the , My grandfather and great grandfather instead of being  Brahmin never discriminated anyone and that&#39;s what I was tought in home ,school and any religious book which I learnt so far , so my humble request to you is instead of abusing all our ancestors as bevkoof just say some of themAnd I know u didn&#39;t mean to say this it was uttered in flow , so don&#39;t think I hate u or I don&#39;t agree with what you said , it&#39;s just a reminder to u that you have crores of followers , who admire u and follow u and they must not misconcieve  that our ancestors was&quot;  bevkoof &quot; we have tons of good teaching given by our ancestors which we all must admire

Bhuvan sir, acchi cheeje koi share ni krta baki faltu stuff sb share krte h. Bt i will share it. Apse hm english ki vocabs seekhte h. Thank you

Bhuvan Bhai, I am your biggest fan in Delhi. You probably don't know how much I have inspired you. Literally, I still show respect to Bhai. I am still in college. I feel that you are black, you don't look like you, you are not worthy of the community, so brother, I have to tell you the truth, I am inspired by myself, and I want to be able to make fun of anyone without pointing out their color. Aram se, o bhai sach btadu to unko m bdl nahi paaya pr ha mne khud pe hee hain start kariya hai ab...Baaki aap to ho hee...

Me sehat me kmzor ho apki Tara to bhot log mazak uratte h or bolte h k to bhot kamzor h to kuch nh kar sakta

We know all these things but our main problem is that we don&#39;t take stand until it happens to us....

From childhood onwards i m facing this discrimination,bcz of these my childhood was destroyed and guess what now i have become a very introvert girl,i tried my best to get a fair skin and i have little-bit succeeded alsoBut then i realises that why the hell i m doing this,just to plz the freaking people obsessed with fair skin.But now i have become a introvert girl who is afraid of talking with people thinking that she will be insulted But now i m trying my best to change myself

Hey bb I am watching THIS T vedio  long time ago it was uploaded but this is correct HINDU MUSLIM COMMUNITY KI LADAI OR SKIN COLOUR DISCRIMINATION GALAT HAI YEAH NAI HONA CHAIYA YEAH SAB KUCH BEKAR LOGO KAY DIMAG SAY NIKLI BEKARAST SOCH HAI

Our country India has the biggest English speaking population in the world although our national language is Hindi. Indians are in so much complex of defining standards by English speaking and all of is are suffering from inferiority complex and are embarrassed to speak hindi among our &quot;modern mentality wale bharwe friends&quot;

Brother you are my God

If someone speaks black to someone then it is bad but if someone is fair then why is it not bad‚Ä¶our perceptions are very wrong‚Ä¶whether people are black or white are also hot or people are black too or you are. Whatever you are, you should be proud of what God has given you..cuz everyone is unique..who says black to you then why do you feel bad...if you feel bad then you associate black color with ugliness. Or you yourself don't like your color..there are many types of people in this society or it is not possible for anyone to tease you for something but if you feel bad about your color then you too Whatever you feel, no matter whether the color is brown or black, you have to think about yourself.. there is no difference between black or white, both are equal, no one is beautiful by being fair or black. no ugly hota...i hope..u got my point.Thankyou
yes moti....
hi..

Hey guys, he makes fun of pan.
One comment of seeing someone black in college time- he looks fair &amp; Lovely's master has come.. but now I realized that a person's color is not his color, his thoughts, his heart should be clean.
Thanks for sharing your noble thoughts.. We neglect these issues but it really matters when it comes to confidence and respect of a living being..

Let's go
When will you take it out? Brother, Diwali in Diwali. Ko 2nd part

See I am not saying that I am nice and all but when I was 5 and now also I never treated people like this ki that she is black stay away from her...I don&#39;t know why people r believing this all I am why

Pls read this message ...U know I was bullied a lot when I was in 1or 2 class and   my family thought isko koi lakme ki creme LA do gori ho jayegi but if we actually see people with dusky or dull colour they r much much much much beautiful than white people. Beauty and fair skin colour doesn&#39;t matter in ur life but when u have correct values inside that matters.....

Necessary to think more than that, I like u.. Love u..

Nice girl
Everyone makes fun of me being thin, even my family members, instead of building my confidence, they make me weak, give pimples on my face, I am a useless person, I am beautiful, I am not a good person, I am giving relationship to any girl, I am not really able to talk to anyone. b Karna likes NH Karta

I am not brown, you are not white and they are not black! Our bodies are just like  tools operated by our souls Ô∏è                                         - Richard Williams

Very true brother
Yes

Love youuuuu
R8. It is like this in Bangladesh also
It's the right thing!
As I say people shamed me in all manners like for my height,skin color,underweight n bla bla but it is an old thing now.

BB I m ur new subscriber after watching ur video.I have lots of experience in this kind of things u said bcuz I m full of flaws but I use my thinking in this kind of situation.

Are you brother, all these political things are not being imposed on anyone, casteism is not being imposed on anything, the leaders in politics have sold their mother's wife, these are the politicians who are harassing us Hindu Muslim brothers.
I agree with you  bb you are the best youtuber

Very nice video

Nyc bhai

I am dark, I have faced all this.
Sir, you are absolutely right, we will definitely fight against this.
I love you, I will marry you and I will marry you.
I like you

Hats off to you BB !! 
It is absolutely true brother, it is true that we live with such people, we live like a family, many of my friends are Hindu but it never occurred to them that we should desecrate or insult their religion, we call them Eid and give them sweets. We talk to Deepawali, we give him sweets, everything is fine, but these news newspapers, all of them are Hindus and Muslims, we don't know what is going on.
I am with you You are right

i,m from bangladesh bb...keep doing...u r great bhai..

I hope to meet you one day 
BB I am facing many problems in my school due to my skin tone. My friends used to give me some inappropriate names like - Kaalu, Kala kawua, Kale hatthi. This is very depressing and annoying. I love your topic of this video.  

All is best

I feel bad when literate ppl even from very high grade colleges also ,boys &amp; girls are so much obsessed with &quot;white skin&quot;. Even education couldnt erase this thinking from their blocked mindset.

My BHI is on Facebook, I am doing this on Facebook, I am planning a bb BHI, I am 13 years old.
Bhai thnk you. .apne aj kuch time mai hume bhut chize sikhadi   i will allways in my life follow your words .

<b>I am from Pakistan or yaar me ap bat samaj raha hon or me bhi yahi sochta hon good think</b>

Nice thought bb you are the inspiration for society.........

There is no one like BB, it is a band of very pure heart, I love you
