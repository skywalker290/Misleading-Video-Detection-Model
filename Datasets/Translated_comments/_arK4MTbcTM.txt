I can not believe it. I eat just a little from tasting my moment with my ambition....... ......
Bro came with PT Cruiser

THIS spectacular scene always puts a BIG smile to my face seeing all those amazing colourful cars come out of that garage, it always reminded me so much of when I was playing with all my Hot Wheels cars as well as watching the older Fast &amp; Furious films at the same time growing up as a kid

All together how many vehicles were there all together there must have been about 100 hundred and also my favorite part is when the trucks came on out to smash the cop cars and by also pushing and shoving the cop car&#39;s on out of the way

some one really brought a suv in a sport car scramble ?

Shitty Japanese cars lmao. American Muscle will shit on these anytime.

No matter how crazy the newer movies get this is this an iconic moment in the series for me

I remember seeing this scene when I was a kid. I immediately went to go recreate it with my hotwheels.

&quot;it&#39;s a scramble baby, a big one!&quot;one of my favorite scenes in the whole franchise.

Lose the police..lol it's really funny...
Shoutout to that one guy who brought along the PT Cruiser.

Anyone knows how they make that slapjacks supra sound

In a world full of beautiful cars I‚Äôd take those pickup trucks

In a world full of beautiful cars I‚Äôd take those pickup trucks

You know I would That was Florida where were the 4x4 trucks they take to the swamps.

That reminds me of forza Horizon 5

It might be fun to have a car you use everyday and a car you don't care about for fun, and it would be even more fun if you had a sports car like this as your second car.
anyone got the time stamp for this 9/11 tribute truck mentioned in the video description

They have the suspect surrounded yes they do themselves. Next time not corrupt minds of babies with all these movies you know after all they teach us in psychology class baby learn by mimiking environment and with parents at work all the time kids watch tv they learn you know from movie without parent supervision like in movie cable guy this proven psychological fact as they see as normal because they accept what they see as baby or small child thats why kids they run around be gangster you know they learn like guy in cable guy movie just to create job for you mr policeman like this movie fast and furious kids see this when they get license they want to go FAST again job for you give speeding ticket i think maybe go speak to your boss mr big in government cause i think maybe the criminal there you know because you know CIA NSA they all speak about all this mind engineering i think this maybe big problem because it affect planet you know.

Bravo 
Back when privacy wasn&#39;t given up, and technology wasn&#39;t as advanced, organised crime like this was actually very difficult to stop. Nowadays, even with hide away licence plates, it&#39;s too easy for cops to track down who they need.

I know at the time they were a dime a dozen back then, but seeing all of those old Caprice 9C1 cop cars get damaged and possibly totaled in this scene REALLY stings, especially with how rare and expensive they seem to be getting nowadays.  But other than that, this has always been one of my FAVORITE scenes in this movie aside from the races, just seeing those big ol&#39; Ram trucks just come out charging like a bunch of angry bulls towards the cops and them having to run or reverse away was just pure gold!

Literally cinematic history with the choreography and coordination of everyone.

Anyone know the first song in this scene?

<a href="">0:51</a> everyone when the vaccine was released in their country

Its hilarious how everyone drove PT Cruisers that have hilariously large grills and weird metallic paint jobs like the brownish orangeish one and that regular silver with a large grill that looks like a new BMW

Someone knows the song in the background?

I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS WEIRD UNTIL I WATCH FAST AND FURIOUS WITH THE ROCK AND MR. HOBBS

Anyone else see the cop car lose a hubcap while rolling in at the beginning?

The aerial shots make it look like a pack of colorful fire ants scattering from an ant hill

<a href="">2:13</a> what car is it?

<a href="">2:52</a> song?
by far my fav scene

FBI: Where the hell are they??Romain: EJECTO SEATO CUZ!!!

I bought GTADid thisThen went home and played GTA

Looks like the police are surrounded by the boy racers and girl racers in the high performance cars and they‚Äôve been force to split up and try and stop one of them at the time before they cause drama on the roads

Good thinking by these brave officers to run away from their cars just incase the pick up trucks go smashing into them some of them even more braver retreated in their cars

Look at differences between the black police helicopter the bell 407 and the white police helicopter the bell 206 the different is the sound even though they are from the same company by the bell group

That‚Äôs a lot of cops

@<a href="">1:44</a> can Anyone explain to me why that ‚Äúyeah‚Äù was awkwardly placed in between those scenes lmao wtf  what does it have to do with anything

<a href="">1:18</a> song?
Can we take a moment and think just how big the interior of that garage is to store THAT many cars?

Ricers wet dream
My favorite scene as a kid. My Dad would always let me know if it was on TV 

18 yrs

Everyone when school dismiss

Anybody notice that them running from the cops on that strip in the city is almost the same at in the other film when they race the police chargers ????

<a href="">1:55</a> the red widebody Porsche is kinky. Time flies..

Name this song ???

<b>When u get 5 stars on GTA V online</b>

I never did understand why the eclipse sounded like a Subaru lol

Fun Fact: Some of these cars were supposed to be planned cars for the movie, but they were scratched off from production unfortunately. Edit: also some of these were leftovers from the first film, sorry about that

The cops got played so hard

Hot Wheels World race highway 35 reference

I miss when The F&amp;F franchise was actually about racing and cars and not fucking heists and shit

In fast and furios most of the drivers are ricers

One question I got... anyone in the comment section who was in this part of the movie?

The car was scattered and the police were overwhelmed
Fast the nest

‚Äú whoa fellas fellas I know my tags are little out of date but damn‚Äù

How to raid Area 51:

In real life, the drivers of these pickups would be immediately shot point blank.

I like and love

The real question is how much they spent on a 3 minute scene

This was real fast and furious.... now it‚Äôs just Dom has a brother who we can‚Äôt see, I still don‚Äôt know who his brother is.

I worked the set for FF2 as it was called during filming, here is a video of this warehouse as it sits today in 2020 (Amazon regional hub for distribution)

Come back here after years Still best scene in FF series no one can beat this scene.And boy this is called street racing,This was movie about being fast and furious with all those freaking cars remembering and gasping back then when we were children after seeing all those luxury of Sports Cars, this scene features brand new cars that were just out.

If this was real life, the cops would&#39;ve shot everyone lmao

Hell yes

At <a href="">1:44</a>, I was in the Silver Supra and that was badass

I prefer the GTA version lol

RIP to those gate openers

How awesome would it be if this happened in real life?!

When I watched this years ago I remember always thinking this was the coolest scene Still do

I watched this movie many times but still don&#39;t know what the plot is.

I remember leaving the theater after watching the 1st fast and furious movie. Everyone left the parking lot like this and continued to do so down the highway. Everyone was pumped from what they just finished watching. Nothing dangerous just having fun. The good old days. Take me back.

So funny lol

<a href="">1:15</a>

Is NISSAN SKAILAINE FOR FAST EN FURIOS

   I love this scene
No multi million dollar supercar in sight

Is this a police training video? Because they are just pointing there guns everywhere like normal cops.

Who let a PT cruiser in there?

Pt cruiser. Guess they ran out of cars

I know my tags are out of date

Runing out a cop car. Well every body has to tray it one time.I did it in 2001 with a BMW 328i tuned to about 220-230 hp. The time was <a href="">22:00</a>h + so empty roads.Well it was not a match with his Opel Astra SW probably 1.8 16V engine with 115 hp.The persut was about 4-5 kilometers long. I hawe evafe him by turning from regional road to local road after gaining some distance and turned off the lights.

back when fast &amp; furious was dope

Out of every car there, is take a Crown Vic.Ultra reliable boat on wheels.

Anybody else see the hubcap rolling at <a href="">0:03</a>?

In real life the police would shoot at those trucks ramming.

One of the best movie scenes

17yrs ago. That is so hard to believe. The older I get, the faster time goes

God those cars were stupid Haha.

Thank God cars like this are dead

im i the only one who would rather drive the 9C1 caprice? with the LT1 and 3.42 gears.

You seen one seen them all.

Back when Fast and Furious movies weren‚Äôt corny as hell and unrealistic

When I saw all the cars in the garage pouring out, my eyes first set on that silver PT cruiser.

<a href="">

All that rice and beans. Just need some cheese and chips.

Best scene in the whole series in my opinion.

Anyone have ketchup for all that rice?

Am I the only one who saw that police hubcap at <a href="">0:04</a>??  it took me 7 times to watch the movie over and over to see that

The car version of Spartacus

The PT Cruiser. Grand Turismo 3 memories lol.

Early 2000s and the street racing era

Gay

In India we need this kind of car culture <a href="">#Cophater</a>

So fake. Police didn&#39;t start shooting
Bruh please tell me i didn&#39;t just see a pt cruiser roll out at <a href="">1:04</a>

When Need for speed payback only got one lobby

cops can&#39;t handle like THIS!!! cops can&#39;t handle like THAT!!! Sexy bitches n&#39; bros SCAT!!!
I&#39;ve been to the place where they shot that

Back when the series was good

Now if u modify anything to aftermarket, ricer. Fucking hell gen z need to fuck off

What happened to the fast and the furious, went from this to just and action movie

I hated it because Officers are hard working and they are now chasing like 100 Car!

<a href="">0:59</a> BTS concert

All these cars had souls back then

HOLY SHIT theres a lots of car

9/11 We will never forget!!!

That is a lot of damage

Pt Cruiser.. best of the lot 

Why is there no super cars

Gay, dumbest gayest movie series ever !!!!
back when fast and the furious was worth the watch

1,2,3,4,5,6,7 cops in my Fukin face

When you have 5 stars in gta 5 but in real life

This shit had little kid me so hype I can‚Äôt even explain

The good times...

How TF it goes from this to fucking submarines throwing cars around the ice.

<a href="">2:14</a> What car is this?

F&amp;F 9 whit tuned cars not exotics

That PT Cruiser doe

At <a href="">2:14</a> the silver car sound good

And this is for a tribute for 911.......

Dude How The Fuck They Do This Scene Shit Thats Alotta Whips Lol

Gay

Imagine a big crash! I did 

How tej go from goofy street racer organizer that didn&#39;t like technology. To being a world class hacker in 4 years?

Before i liked it, but now its like  a ricer community scrambling lol.

all the cop caprices just destroyed goddamn :(

So the question is Where R They???really, where r they? Haha

How did  the Fast and Furious  go from this to saving the fuckn world???

This is gay

Reminded me of Pay-n-Spray from GTA games 

This scene when i was a kid <a href="">#chills</a>

Back when fast and furious was the bollocks

I miss this f&amp;f.

The best scene i have ever seen in my life.

also why did the guy in charge of the chase look so defeated when he thought they were cornered.... like wasnt that the whole point of you telling them where they were to the helicopters lol.

as an american and someone moderately knowedgeable about symbols of 9-11    i dont remember that truck being in this movie.   but sure as shit it makes its first appearance at <a href="">1:05</a> without the campershell.

Wow I see German, Japanese and American cars

I remember being a kid and watching this and thinking how fucking badass that was

People would rather beef and argue at car meets than perform elaborate scrambles lmao

This movie is a stain on the whole franchise.

Holy shit!Look at all those Hot Wheels 

When 2f2f was bout racing and dope cars

Halo cops and robbers be like

I like them Dodge ram trucks

this makes me miss those days. the cars may not have been entirely functional or even fast, but they had so much fucking cool it didnt matter. i cant wait until i can build my own 2000s tuner car, i dont care what most people think

This scene had the same energy as the final fight scene in the endgame.

Who disliked this video? Kind of woman like mans hah?

Oh god damn those 3000gts hell yes

If im a cop and real i will sacrifice ill crash the heli to the ground

I just saw a pt cruiser in there ruined the whole scene forever

This was my favorite part in the movie when I used to see it when I was a kid. Me an my little brother would always do this part with little cars haha..cause we had a bunch of them and two cop cars and we would just act it out.

Ricepocalyption

i wonder how many accidents did it take to film this scene?

Who els did this with hot wheels as a kid?

Back when cars actually looked different and were unique :(

Stupidest movie franchise ever.

When u punch someone on gta <a href="">0:03</a>

This me and my friends!

the best part of 2 fast 2 furious

That scene makes no sense police had guns and didn&#39;t open fire on any of them trucks heading straight at them?? Come on unrealistic or what.

Its called 2fast 2furious shitheqd

Irl cops would open fire due to use of deadly weapon against them (and yes, I mean cars as deadly weapon) and it would be fully legal even if they had killed some guys. Seen this multiple times, so this scene seems to me very unrealistic.

The Blue S14 
Did anybody else catch sight of the Hot Wheels custom Civic?

Best moment

And for a movie
Badass scene, I would&#39;ve rather seen some super dutys or some duramaxs in that scene though, they are the best 3/4 ton trucks

one of the most epic scenes in fast and the furious franchise, and most memorable

The cops would have wasted those trucks

Shit movie 
rice as far as the eye can see

what is the music <a href="">0:30</a>

Rip the god Paul walker

I love is video!!

where are they!?

Sad that the fast and the furious went from Street racing to GTA 5 smh

 10000 cars
My favourite scene

No

This is Florida I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t shoot the truck drivers 

Okay, I&#39;ll ask it. Why does the purple Mitsubishi sound like a Subaru...?

<b>need for speed be like</b>

HEAVEN !!!

I see how there&#39;s car guys seeing this and saying &quot;RICER!!&quot; yes they are ricers I definitely cannot deny that but still this scene was pretty cool, if they actually had tuned good looking cars then it would be better

The best line ever said in any Marvel movie!‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù 

( Start of the Scramble) When your late to attend a Family Reunion. 

&quot;This is unit 2599 we have the suspect surrounded at least from this side&quot;

Back when it used to be about street racing and running away from cops. Now it&#39;s about fighting an army and driving tanks really fast

imagine watching this movie when it came out and all those cars were brand new. some of you prolly have but i was born in 01 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Rip Paul.

Show ur cars for catch.Ô∏è
O hell no

Back in the day fast and furious is a movie about tuning a car for race, not for doing some saving earth from the alien

So predictable and boring. A waste of time.

So many cars
