I came here for Tara... I love her ❤

Watching this interview after 4 years and just made  realise that ananya pandey was trolled for no reason..she is a kind hearted person ❤

THIS RAJEEV IS A TERRIBLE INTERVIEWER, DIRECT A QUESTION TO SOMEONE OR START WITH A PERSON DON&#39;T RANDOMLY JUST ASK  MID AIR

Ananya was actually right when saying dispensable…..not indispensable as Tara corrected…

Siddhant and Vishal both were cool 😎 👌

I don&#39;t think any show can compete kapil sharma show.

vishal❤
Siddhant&#39;s face while the strugglers are talking

I feel like they were well grounded. Everyone should Leave Ananya alone. She is so real.

Ananya panday is very sweet girl I like this

Deep down inside we all know that we are here for Ananya&#39;s bullshit talks😂😂😂😂

I think the problem with Ananya is not that she is a star kid but the problem is she is not a good actress like she said “people don&#39;t see if acchi acting kar rhi h ya nhi they just see ki star kid h&quot; but for me it&#39;s not like that I just think others deserve that certain role more than her cause she is not a good actress at the first place!

<a href="">32:44</a> is the scene why you are here .

<a href="">41:43</a> Siddhant you killed it 🤣🤣😅

People have been too unfair to Ananya. It’s true what she said. Her father was not a top star. He was a supporting actor and barely had two hit films in his prime. Hardly a “star” dad to a “star” kid.

This was such a cringe fest.

Tara sutaria is just all about looks thats all

Only here for Vishal Jethwa

Tara is so shining

everyone in the comments talked about ananya already, so no need lmao but i noticed even abhimanyu gave this very entitled, self-obsessed vibe throughout this interview. &quot;a doctor starts with a father and mother at their dispense, don&#39;t they&quot; what rubbish. there&#39;s a literal merit-based entrance exam students have to clear, in which no one is checking ki tera baap ya maa bhi doctor hain, or your uncle is lol the only &quot;merit&quot; given in bollywood is open to exploitation.also, sorry but the way saloni batra was sucking up to ananya and abhimanyu with &quot;accepting their nepotism&quot; struggles was disappointing.

Geetika is so talented actress I noticed her work in thappad and honestly in this interview it felt like people ignoring her including Sid so I guess the industry or in general people ignore a lot

Vishal performance in mardani was excellent

I like this❤

Vishal Jedhwa and Sid Chaturvedi
How are they telling thi that to become a doctor a doctor parents would help you.. Really I mean neet toh bakwas hai na,,, talking like some uneducated people.. My dad is an ips officer and now he will help me to become an ips officer too 😂😂

The comparison of actors and doctors is the most dumb comparison I’ve ever heard.

Nandan Champak Nanhe Samraat❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
For me the star of this whole episode is none other than Vishal Jethwa.

<a href="">51:39</a>

I really think that anaya was really trying to make a valid point but it just came out in a wrong way. If u try to understand the context, the thing that she is trying to say, kinda makes sense. It just came out in a wrong way. And ananya was surely trolled till an unnecessary extent because only a small clip of this thing was circulated. But when u actually hear the whole thing it surely doesn&#39;t sound like she has made a non sensible argument (looking at the emotion and not going wid the words cuz she clearly mis-expressed)

Why Siddhant had to say that <a href="">59:00</a>🤦🏻

Damnn Mann , sidharth was just eagerly waiting to nail that shit .... Ohh mannn🔥🔥🤣🤣

This woman in blue is simply bootlicking the nepo products

Ananya&#39;s accent is so irritating!

Hollywood people won't even look at you guys, so who cares about interviewing in English? I am ashamed to be illiterate in speaking Hindi.
Masand gets a call everytime from His Pimps in Bollywood saying we want our brainless Bimbos in the interview no matter you have to put out some other genuine artists..

Omg ! as a CS student mujhe itna accha laga ki Vishal knows about CS kyuki generally people don&#39;t know about this profession . 😂😅

Siddhant&#39;s comment will keep burning nepo-asses for years to come..

Why is ananya in this panel. Her only talent is touching her nose through her tongue

<a href="">41:39</a> siddhant one line.... ya ya😎🤨😁💥
My son never used to study then I told him that if you don&#39;t study then he will become like Ananya Pandey now he is coming top in all exams

No matter what you say about ananya, but she is so beautiful, sweet, cute, her eyes tell everything, she is a star...the world on her eyes....

I love ananya, Vishal, their eyes are so beautiful!!!!

A bunch of good for nothing people just arguing about their struggle and some shit..  first you become successful and make a mark then you can make statement about your struggle

That &quot;tin ka tapra&quot; reference 😂 only Siddharth gets it!

Not abhimanyu crying for a fcking airport looks and magazine covers, bruh

@ r after <a href="">41:40</a>....he made everyone behave akwardly ...HAHAHAAHHA

She one lost soul, can’t blame her but also can’t ignore her. She is a terrible actress and doesn’t know what to say where. She glorifies her struggle like its the end of the world. Am sure Sidhant has answered with his one liner.

Ananya: I sat on many laps…Tara: Oh God, Ananya…Ananya: As a child…Tara: 🤦🏻‍♀️ 😂🤣
<a href="">7:05</a> <a href="">13:22</a> <a href="">20:06</a> <a href="">24:43</a> <a href="">36:23</a> <a href="">49:34</a> <a href="">1:01:16</a> <a href="">1:08:35</a> <a href="">1:08:47</a>

Loved how vishal, tara supported siddhant with their silence.

Saloni Batra advocating for nepotism is so annoying.

Everyone is here for <a href="">41:45</a> ......hha ha ah
hindi speaking should be made mandatory

TARA GIVES RUBI VIBES FROM SEX EDUCATION.

Ananya&#39;s struggle at <a href="">41:31</a>

<b><i>who knew at that time that Rajiv is gonna ask a question about trolling to Ananya and thia whole interview would become another reason for Ananya&#39;s trolling.</i></b> 😂😂

Abhimanyu is different 🙌🤩

Unnecessary line by siddharth on ananya. She is so true to herself and others. She said some wise words! Comparing and believing my struggle is bigger than others&#39; is silly.

My dad
I am just wondering ananya was 2 he met Hrithik RoshanIn 2 years he watched Hrithik Roshan

Go directly to <a href="">40:09</a> for ananya nepo dialogue

The girl in blue is such a bootlicker

The 1 second gap after siddhant Chaturvedi dialogue was for that &#39;ooooohhhhhh&#39; wala meme😂

I came to see Vishal he&#39;s so great actor I hope we see him in other work I want him to be Dhoom&#39;s 4 villan

Ananya&#39;s vocabulary consists mainly of &#39;like,starstruck,Dad&#39;.

Ananya at <a href="">1:09:19</a> it was hilarious.

Why is sidharth seating here

The way Vishal started talking in Hindi fearlessly without feeling awkward. So confidently. Very very proud

I saw the whole interview and I am not at all angry at ananya, her replies are a bit childish but she and abhi aren&#39;t wrong

The table really turn when Siddharth enters the chat

Vishal and  siddhant be sitting there listening to ananya talk about her struggles and thinking wow this is called struggle so what we did in the name of struggle like you are even talking about what you had to do to get a film in front of those people is like nibbi talking about how hard life is in front of a man who is struggling to make two ends meet.

<a href="">41:17</a>don&#39;t think so she would be into the movies if she wasn&#39;t a nepotism product😂😂

will smith was blue😁

Ananya said the write word “dispensable” . People are dispensable. Tara just confused her.

I hope vishal get more opportunities...he was so genuine

just boycott these starkids movies pleasee we have to get them out of this Bollywood 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

vishal and sid is real struggler between them ❤❤❤ and Bollywood should need them these starkids make Bollywood a sewage

Ananya is the kind of English speaker Who starts with So you know likeAnd end withHa so you know like 😂

How tara, siddhant and Vishal didn&#39;t nod even once when she was babbling

To be very frank Mard was a trash film.

I wish Vishal and siddhanth had talked more, they were brilliant in characters they had played. that&#39;s why I love to hear them talk rather than Ananya&#39;s bullshit 🙄But Siddhanth&#39;s one liner👏

Ok i&#39;m going, the one liner of siddhant is over🌝🙌

Theatre background ke baad ye acting...bechare naseer shahb side khade hoke ro rahe honge

Only here for Sidhant

Vishal is awesome in his acting I m a huge admirer of him after mardaniSuch a talented guyI wanna see him more

only liking this stupid interview because of Siddhant&#39;s unfiltered Reply

All these snacks and no one is even touching them 🙂 How rude can you be to FOOD 🙂

I think Ananya learn a lesson about what is struggle through this interview. She performed brilliantly in Gehraiyaan.

<a href="">41:28</a>

This Saloni Batra really tried to take the sides of Ananya and so called poooo.just to be on good books of Bollywood biggies..but does that even help her? Like they never respected people like Nawazuddin Siddiqui,Pankaj Tripathi.. how disgusting

Yrr my father also didnt have iphone in 1998 when i was born… see how embarrassing was it for me in classroom that i couldnt showoff

If my speaking style becomes like Ananya then my mummy chappal 🩴 fekk k martin
Why none of them are eating those delicious snacks on the the table? That looks more catching than their conversation...

One actor and a bunch of rich kids

I did not and still cannot understand why Ananaya was trolled and hated so much for what she said. She clearly accepted her privilege when she mentioned that she felt blessed to be born as her father’s daughter, and addressed the struggles of her father, not herself. Never once did she tell or even imply that she struggled. People really blew it out of context on this one. Poor girl, she was only 20 something during this interview and was bashed relentlessly for absolutely no fault of hers.

<a href="">1:02:06</a> Siddhant understanding Vishal&#39;s feelings.
I know Siddarth’s one line stole the show. But, my fav line was “Let’s make table bigger rather walls grow taller”

Here Sidhant Chaturvedi is so confident and energetic to an annoying level... whereas in Gehraiyan promotions , he is so silent....why so???

struggle for a star kid is not getting ivitied in koffe  with karan or when thier airport looks are not noticed , while struggle for a outsider is even getting casted as a side actor.

Jump to <a href="">41:40</a>, that&#39;s the meat

can anyone tell me who are the actresses ( apart from Tara and Ananya ) in blue and maroon and which movie they acted in ?

Struggle starts at <a href="">40:09</a>

honestly, i had no idea Abhimanyu was Bhagyashree’s son until I googled him up after Meenakshi Sundareshwar. he’s really right about having been low-key throughout.

Holy shit Abhimanyu Dassani is insufferable!

41.47 Silence 🤣😂
<a href="">41:43</a> i know everybody came to watch this

<a href="">40:00</a> the line which you came forthank me later

Vishal Jethwa acting skills in Mardaani2 frightened me in my nightmare.I watched the movie midnight 12 amHe must be praised for such an outstanding negative role.

I think abhimanyu is talented and also down to earth,he is raised well by bhagyashree

Strugle

The screen plays for the films these new comers were launch in were not very inspiring to say the least !  How about investing in educated  writers !

Only for gully boy siddhant chaturvedi ❤️❤️

Every one is here for vishal The amazing actor.

Vishal and sidhhant be like kaha phas gya bakchodo mein😂😂

@<a href="">1:06:47</a> Ananya talks about sitting on many laps of the industry. This line is taken from Koffee with Karan Alia&#39;s episode. She should watch less KWK and focus on more acting. Its fine to extract content from somewhere else, but to extract outright non-paraphrased jokes is a bit odd.

Tara is best in bollywood

Ammero ga GD
The gully boy won the battle!!!!😁

Damn that  two lines dialogue just stole the show🔥😂

I like mardani actor

<a href="">41:35</a> the motive why you came here. And the thing you want to watch......Thank me later

SO SIDHANT AND VISHAL BE LIKE kyu general, talk me bhi itni over acting krre ho yr... Looking at all these guys face i can tell only those 2 guys were being genuine and didn&#39;t give a fake smile

<a href="">17:37</a> perhaps the best expression Ananya Panday has ever given in her entire acting career by far!🤣

Look for some more work Ananya, acting is not your cup of tea..
They all r really kids yeh iss interview ki ease se samjh aa rha hain..havnt seen this kind of raw roundtable.. Which is really good!!!!

people who complain about nepotism just need to stop watching such movies in the theatre

<a href="">41:54</a> Chalo koi toh tap kia sirdhant ko after that savage dialogue like she literally got the taunt 🤣🤣

Can&#39;t believe this amazing roundtable is now 2 years old. Still feels like yesterday. Love you Siddhant Chaturvedi. And also Tara, Abhimanyu and Vishal Jethwa.

So you can imagine, how Ananya is living in her own Fairy universe where doing a dharma movie being on  coffee show is a acheivement may be more than winning national award

<a href="">50:06</a> sidhhant says ajgar pala😂😂😂😂 man this guy is hilarious

From actor and actress we as audience only expect acting. We really don&#39;t care who is a star&#39;s kid or not from industry. But when star&#39;s kid who literally has no experience in acting or can&#39;t even act or speak gets lead role is baffling. In SOTY 2 also, Ananya had more screening than Tara which I couldn&#39;t understand as Tara has acted earlier and was nice in the entire movie whereas Ananya was below average (I didn&#39;t even know that she is Chunky Panday&#39;s daughter). She also got best debut when there were other much better actresses. Also, when they all were talking about acting workshop in the middle of the video, look at her face and body language. Some star&#39;s kid just focus on their bodies, face, dance to debut whereas crucial thing which is ACTING is left behind. But not all star&#39;s kid are lame. Some have great acting skills like Farhan, Amir, Kareena, Alia etc etc. Some are just way too bad that all we as audience do is skip the movie.

Ananya took 2 minutes to comprehend what Siddhant said lolLook at her empty face😂

Ananya took 2 minutes to comprehd what Siddhant said lolLook at her empty face😂

Don&#39;t waste your time..... Just hit it <a href="">41:41</a>

The way siddharth smiles at the people he respects and loves is so appealing ❤️

People of the industry are *Dispensable.

Love Abhimanyu ❤️❤️ genuine guy with pure talent

<a href="">41:20</a>

The best actor among all of them that&#39;s vishal jethwa was the quietest one...this shows legends speak less work more!!

Ananyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ananya is so cute
Ananya pandey ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ beautiful actress ❤️💕🥰💕💕🥰
i was looking at Geetika (the girl beside siddhant) constantly and i think she was the only one who got the humor and was whispering to him after his SAVAGE line........ she totally agreed with him.

Vishal Jethwa and Siddhant Chaturvedi be like :- This is what is going on among the rich people.
<a href="">41:53</a> that girl sitting beside Siddarth slowly tap him like: you naughty naughty 😂😂😂

Abhimanyu ❤️❤️
<a href="">1:10:10</a> 🤣🤣Literally everyone&#39;s Expression
Only here for vishal

<a href="">44:00</a> &quot;More difficult for a starkid..&quot; LOL If you are a starkid who wants to act, then learn better and enter the film industry. Don&#39;t just expect people to like you.

<a href="">41:40</a>

Why is no one talking about the continuous wrong use of the word &quot;indispensable&quot;?

41.43 Why didn't I shake...😅
Pls could anyone translate what wa said in <a href="">41:44</a> by sid in English..!!

The difference is not that you are a nepo because you are born in a rich family, but the difference is that your father and mother is asking people to sign their child in their career and calling itself as a struggle the child has done, The term which nowadays Men and women use is &#39;Self-made&#39; but they Don&#39;t apply them in the real life, Earning money doesn&#39;t mean you are successful, Just like Elon Musk is a person who doesn&#39;t run behind money, he is  an intelligent person, Not like you, We call you nepo and will always say this to you because you are truly a &#39;Easy-made  women&#39;

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

w believe in SONI supremacy&lt;33

Vishal jethwa has no comparison ❤️🔥
<a href="">41:49</a> Annoying Pandey reaction was like &quot;Yaar itni mushkil se monologue ratta mara tha,Sab par paani pher diya&quot;🌊 😂😂

I just came here to watch abhimanyu dassani 🖤

dude forget about these stars , what I&#39;m thinking about is the UNTOUCHED food laid on the table :)))

comment section..bashing ananya...and loving vishal..cut 2...on insta..ananya&#39;s insta has grown from 7 M to 20 M while Vishal is at 354K..lol..so ultimately its the ppl here and the cribbing janta who is responsible...

These wannabe actresses mention kareena&#39;s pooh as an inspiration...lol.. I get their standard.. gone are the days when talented actresses like Rani would rule the roost...but why do ppl complain about nepotism? An ananya pandey has 20 M followers while Sanya Malhotra has 2M followers..

He is so cute

Love for abhimanyu💓

I love this bunch 😂😂😂

What is nepotism ananya debut just 18 and other wait 28

My struggle in the morning in toilet is less than Ananyas Struggle .Today I did spent my longest in toilet  watching this video

Its worrying that a good chat of 1 hr and only thing 90% of people commenting is about ananya .

Honestly, I think I struggled more to tolerate Ananya in this video than I think she struggled in her acting career....

I swear I love Siddhant so much .... Thank god for gully boy and love his and Ranveer&#39;s friendship.....And to seeing Vishal Jethwa from Maharana Pratap to Mardani 2  and Tara Sutariya from jessie to villan ....Gosh they came so far from tv to Bollywood And from child actors to mature adults....Loved the simplicity of Vishal he didn&#39;t try to speak in english in a fancy way.... he stayed with his comfortable language....And can we please talk about Abhimanyu Dassani ... He is so down to earth even though being a star kid ...Like just compare his humbleness to Ananya and u will understand....

They are STAR KIDS  , still I didn&#39;t know their names even they exist till now . Except  Ananya  from the table .  They are completely  outsiders  to me .

I&#39;m here right after Ananya Pandey&#39;s drug bust case 😂😂😂

Who is here after Ananya pandey has been summoned by the NCB? This is her struggle <a href="">#StruggleGetsReal</a>

<a href="">41:42</a>

Chunkey Pandey is a big star .Ananya your acting skills are not even close to your father .

Got second hand embarrassment, sitting between people who are self made, talented and humble Pandey ji simply made a fool out of herself.

Abhimanyu dasani is a gem

Sid became a nationwide hero on this day and Ananya officially became a laughing stock, meme material, struggler !!

I can say to Daave that this matter will come to my understanding later.
I know I will get some negativity for what I&#39;m gonna say but I really loved the character of Abhimanyu he really seems like a nice person don&#39;t know him as an actor as I haven&#39;t seen his work yet but the points that he made were actually logical. And ofcourse loved all the others also.

For me Vishal will always be Jalal Uddin Muhammad Akbar in Maharana Pratap 🤣🤣
Wait what Ananya pandey doin in here

<a href="">41:45</a> just look at ananya&#39;s Face;  bichari😩

Ugh, I love Kareena/Poo’s relevance and influence

I am here only for vishal jhetwa such a brilliant and outstanding actor. Very talented actor. seen him first in  maharana pratap I  liked his acting skills and in mardani 2 he just nailed it . I really want to see him in more upcoming  movies as a lead actor. Not in negative roles . He really needs more appreciation.I  really want to see him in movies.

Sala aisa bol gaya...nepo kids ko sochne pe majboor kar diya....and the guy who agrees is like....&quot;mere ko samajh aa gaya tera dukh &quot; haha

Really proud of you Boi VISHAL JETWA..... u have reached such level in this young age &amp; proved urself

<a href="">41:40</a> moments before disaster
Ananya Pandey&#39;s English = 1Ananya Pandey&#39;s Acting = 0
Tara Sutaria and Vishal Jethwa were together in Oye Jassie and now here they are .

<a href="">41:40</a> destroyed in seconds

All avengers

I think what Siddharth meant is that getting debut movie is difficult for start kids while it&#39;s a dream come true for outsiders.

She could have gone to USA  🇺🇸 at least this talented  people  could  get more chance .....Tara is  much better than  her..she is simply a  nepotism product  learn from them   each  of then  r well educated  they did so many thing  they were  never introduced  by any big banner she  kept silent...

They r So  talented  but unfortunately  I get to see only  this  salamander struggling lady for pr activity

I think mn m ananya is feeling outsider kha bula liya mujhe ghar jana hai ???
Ananya&#39;s accent is annoying as hell.

41;26 Moments before destruction
<a href="">42:26</a> What an utterly <b>stupid</b> argument.

&quot;Where our dreams come true is where our struggle begins.&quot; Such a mic drop moment.
Iconic interview😂😂

I just came for only vishal jethwa

I thought that struggle punch from siddhant was random but damn ! the fuel started burning from <a href="">11:33</a>

There&#39;s difference between bullying and healthy criticism. This comment section shows that. I think what ananya was talking about her father&#39;s struggle that he was never an A lister. Ps-not a fan of ananya just a person who&#39;s who digusted by the amount of hatred on social media.

Ananya telling her struggle Others be like -ok your bla bla is eating me

Her English is really annoying I mean Ananya

School Debate Competition😂

Which kind of dumbo she is didn&#39;t get that sid buried her within seconds

what struggle what brother Ananya
Ananya Pandey is so stupid

🙃

Where is Shivaleekha oberoi

No hatred for anyone...Everyone deserves what he/she has got until now &amp; will get in future 😌❣

Alike Ananya I also want to be Shanaya for once but Unlike her My this wish is never gonna be true 😹

Tara Sutaria from lob🤍✨
Tara Sutaria from lob🤍✨
Ananya Panday spoilt  worst actress
I AM ONLY HERE FOR Vishal Jethwa

Promoting nepotism bloody bollywood

Sidhant mereko thoda jalu laga

I just Love how Siddhant and vishal look at e/o (while the other talks), agree , relate and just the complete of these two☺️👏hope they get to portray many more interesting characters and rise to their deserving fame.Also I would love it if my apps stop showing so many Ananya featuring ads💀✋like bro seriously stop!😭🧍‍♀️

<a href="">1:01:50</a> he was like bhai kiske saath fhas gaya😂😂😂😂

Siddhant shouldnt have said that it’s just simply humiliating and rude. Everybody has a different fate, it’s not anyone’s fault cz what if siddhant was in ananya’s shoes, don’t treat another person how you wouldn’t wanna be treated.

actors like vishal jhetwa  has no film after giving performances in Mardani . Go and search about it.

<a href="">41:43</a> sigma rule
<a href="">41:40</a> thank me later.

Why not shevalika oberoi invited? Who else think this...hit👍👇👇👇

No Drs son/daughter are not always Drs.Don’t try to justify. This is the bull shit they keep feeding to younger generations and make them believe nepotism/discrimination is okay.

<a href="">41:26</a>

Tara and Sidhant would look good together

Look at Siddhant’s face at 7.00 when Ananya is talking an look at his face when Vishal is talkings 7.12😂😂

I wonder why the roundtable with Jim Sarbh was removed...

no ananya your father&#39;s parents couldn&#39;t make him into a doctora big national exam is required to be cleared to become a doctor

I luv tara the way she speak its so good❤️

I love how everyone ignored what Siddhant said at <a href="">41:44</a>.😂

Ananya - my dad never went to Koffe with Karan how unfortunate he is Meanwhile Hardik and kl - oh Bhai Maro mujhe Maro

Tara sutaria ones proposed me.You do not believe it is your problem............But then my friend kicked me oh you are getting late for college .such a big dream ruiner

Maturity is when you realize that she never said &quot;Maine bahut struggle kiya hai&#39;&#39;

Respect for Geetika. Writing Unnao on her hand and bringing this topic to fore

Vishal is such a talented actor..❤️❤️❤️
41: 26 😌. She takes like as if she is teasing the vibe 🤣🤣

When rajeev asked the girls question first geetika and saloni they answered so camly letting one answer and wait for the other but then we have tara nad Ananya answering like debate aur annaya is not even listening and waiting for tara

Like here everyone was inertially awkward and onec a time grumpy but why Ananya is grumpy throughout

Idiot to become a doctor u have to clear neet 😂😂😂 u have to prepare hard to get a cllg even if u get a private cllg u have to put your sweat nd blood in studying for whole 6 yr then u become a doc..... But for an actor u need an actor papa and dharma nd karan johar that&#39;s all u are already an actor 🤣

Ye blue blazer wali kitni pakau hai... pure diplomat.. napo k itni buri chaplusi kr rhi h...to make some frnds in the industry ...desperately

Vishal jethwa you are true actor❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just because one&#39;s a star kid, doesn&#39;t mean that they won&#39;t have problems or struggles in their lives. Even though they might be richer or more sourceful, nobody&#39;s life is perfect. Even star kids like Annanya herself must have dealt with serious issues like mental stress, the paparazzi since childhood, lack of privacy and many more. I just wished some  people seemed it like that.

these nepotism kids are so blinded by their privilege lmaoo

When did Chunky Pandey become a star?🤣🤣🤣
<a href="">41:26</a> and <a href="">41:43</a> together defines &#39;Nepotism&#39; mentality in the best way possible!

My ears hearing their voices Eyes on food on table😛

Here only for Vidya

Siddhant op bro 👌👌👌😆
Do it one by one
Don&#39;t go down ✋Most comments are about vishal and siddhant ,infact,I was also here for them !! 😌 Yes yes all are good

Geetika was best female debut artist in that year.. But filmfare chose ananya over her..

<a href="">41:25</a> when savage reply on siddhant head

<a href="">41:35</a> guys savage moment
vishsal jethwal must be irritated by the continuous chitter chatter of ananya and tara

I personally never hated ananya pandey until i saw her way of speaking😂😂 uske baad soty 2 dekhne ki himmat nahi hui

That denim jacket wala boy looks like indian cricketer Sreyas Iyer... 😃

<a href="">41:43</a> SPAM this reload button...

Tara ❤️
This is ananya is just unaware that is it ... but sid was brutal 🤣

SIDDHANT AND ANANYA LOOK CUTE TOGETHER

Myself Pratyush Pattanaik from Odisha, i'm saying Ananya Pandey is a Star Kid Ghatiya Actress... Nonsense, Nepotism 👎👎👎👎
Why is he harassing Ananya Pandey? What an actor he is...
<a href="">58:00</a> siddharth and vishal be like ye kis chutia ke saath bitha diya

I love MC sher! and he is also an SRK fan.&lt;3

Mei was impressed by vishal and siddardh
Vishal jhetwa bap hy acting ka sb mn

I am so proud of tara honestly, I used to love her on TV, she had such great aura

<a href="">1:13:05</a> just play it in slow motion and see reaction of sidhant

Vishal Jetwa is the only star I see amongst the rest. And the red top chick.

The fact that not one dark skinned person is represented here in a 70% dark skinned nation says a lot about BOLLYWOOD.

Being a star kid &amp; becoming actor/actress isn’t a crime but if you want to get respect you need to gain it through skills &amp; efforts instead of getting films after films on your parent&#39;s recommendation

Nice love it
I fell in love with the poise and maturity Tara has... Truly impressed

Don&#39;t you feel only &quot;someone&quot; is given too much of light

I literally don&#39;t know why but you guys aren&#39;t still understanding what Ananya  meant when she said that it is hard to be a starkid, people watched this show and again started slamming the struggle and nepotism drama at her so please first understand what she said full and don&#39;t bring this drama thing, leave it like a phase it&#39;s been a year since I started seeing memes on her, and I am not supporting her or nepotism or anything, thank you 🙂

Koffee with Karan is not the benchmark Ananya😂😂😂 What made her comment that!!!

People who came to see that one liner from Siddhant so to make it easier for you directly jump to <a href="">41:35</a> sec.

that one line said by Siddhant is the spotlight of entire show.Tara Sutara is really immensely beautiful and gorgeous I mean her features her way of talking and everything is just fabulous.

I want siddharth to marry me

that one single line by siddhant had more impact than ananya&#39;s whole career

Pananya Andey ki jai ho
Why the hell was Ananya included in this interview?

Who all are here after Vishal Jetwa....

Siddhant&#39;s one liner💥✌🤣
I, m here only for vishal jethwa he is the best 🎀🎀🎀

Vishal jethwa is the best and he deserved more and more 💙💙💙💙💙💙

Vishal jethwa fans are you here 🔥🔥🔥💙💙💙💙<a href="">#Vishalians</a>
Siddhant&#39;s smile while Vishal was speaking was so honest and magical. Bhaad mai jaaye English. Hindi mai simplicity.

Ananya was speaking and Tara was trying to speak so she can be visible in video

<a href="">41:43</a>This is what l came for🤷‍♀️
Here just for ananya&#39;s struggle

❤Vishal❤ Love him
<a href="">55:20</a> Tara&#39;s expression 😍
You know, you know,you know

Please anybody translate to English what Siddharth said at <a href="">41:10</a>

His father is not engaged in coffee with karan, wow what a struggle...
Deserving debutantes SHIVALEEKA OBEROI VARDHAN PURI AND PEANUTAN BAHL
<a href="">41:25</a> onwards for Dharma Film and Koffee with karan

Everyone is talking about how Siddhant roasted Ananya. But after that the immediate reaction of Vishal was more hilarious 😂😂😂

I saw Geetika in thappad and she was awesome

<a href="">38:22</a> this guy spoke his heart out. I liked this part 🔥

<a href="">40:40</a> Indispensable? She meant dispensible. If you are going to speak a language and have so much available around you then at the very least LEARN it properly....

Vishal is the greatest talent on that table right there, and you cannot change my mind!

<a href="">41:41</a> aao one liner sunne

Every answer of Ananya Pandey is worth getting trolled ! Reallyy..what is asked..what is she answering 😂

Why no one is talking about Abhimanyu...His answers seems really smart, funny and genuine ☺️

Every one of them is so nice.... It&#39;s so refreshing to listen to each one of them.

Siddhant&#39;s epic response at <a href="">41:41</a> Don&#39;t forget to see Ananya&#39;s face after that 😆

&quot; Blame them for being born into an artistic family, is not right &quot; _  Nobody blames them for being the children of stars, but the wrong thing that happens is that they take the lead role without any attempt + siddhant was the only honest person in the midst of all this hypocrisy.

Geetika is a great talent ❤️

Hamari HINDI promote kyu nhi hoti in some another country ? And why u guys take an interview in English always or all the time ? Sochi Zara iss bare mein

Finally actors speaking in Hindi... Why we Indians always promote English... Hindi meih bhi interview Lia Karo Yaar🔥

just have a look at rajeev masand&#39;s hands so smalll !!!

Ananya met Krithik when she was 2 years old and still she says she struggled to be in films!!! Really! Starkids struggles are unreal. They directly start their career from films others have to start their career from auditions and 30 seconds advertisements .

Just came to see talks between Ananya and Siddharth

Leave Ananya, who will eat food in front of me?
1 for ananya pandey. Dhol raised his half himself.
<a href="">41:41</a> it is.

I&#39;m watching this video again..now I m wondering why were Ananya and Tara even there?Rajeev reasons please..

Vishal jethwa acted soo brilliant 👏👏👏
Many wants to watch ananya even if they hate her.🙄

Nothing in this world can justify nepotism. Actors who are deserving are lagging behind because of it.

Epic

She compared doctors with actors....She is the most dumbest person on earth🙏🏻😂😂😂😂😂

Girl in Iraq: Crying cause her dad is deadAnanya: Crying cause her dad didn’t go on Kofee with karanThe sturggle is real!! 😭 😭

The one who talks the most is always the least intelligent.

Bollywood has got a bright future .....

I can&#39;t believe someone beautiful like Tara got bullied I got bullied too

Anyay Pamdet got a freeze after listening to Sidhant.
The Infamous Struggle Walee Interview

Here just only for siddhant 👍👍👍🙌🙌🙌
People treat nepo kids like they ain&#39;t human.

Siddhant Bhai❤
“You know...my dad works very hard....you know....he still is working very hard....you know.....you know.....” left the interview there! 😏🤦‍♂️

<a href="">17:38</a> look what dumb bananaya is doing

41.18

I am here only for vishal jethwa 😍

<a href="">41:33</a>

Only here for vishal jhetwa

Tara is superbbb

<a href="">1:10:08</a> Who gets star struck at the age of 2? Such a dumb thing to say.

such lovely souls ❤️❤️
Vishal is soo real💯

Lol 😂 nonsense at the best. When Sid said that line ...people r saying savage n all bt one thing to note sid father is a Chartered accountant..if sid will complete his Chartered accountancy course and taken his fathers office and clients.  The same line any new qualified CA from his firm can say to Sid . Nepotism is bad untill its helping u . And that it . Bollywood is not a govt. Job ..itna paisa lagta hai ..ab jiski jese marzi  wo uspe paise lagaega ... sid is a good actor ..bt yaha bhai ne victim card play kiya unnecessarily 🙏

Ananya said it well till she spoiled in the end🙄. And y no one acknowledged siddharts statement after her so called struggle.

<a href="">41:47</a> Siddhant seeks acknowledgment from his peers around the table-Abhimanyu- gets defensive &amp; is ready to refuteVishal- understand the weightage of the statement and relates Geetika- diffuses the tension with that pat on his arm. She later even interacts abt the same one to oneSaloni- clearly doesn’t want to ruffle any feathers Anything spoken in Hindi is incomprehensible by Tara , Ananya &amp; Rajeev.

Watching Vishal Jethwa is so humbling.

In the previous round table of newcomers all the star kids when questioned about nepotism politely answered as how they accept and acknowledge the fact that yes they are privileged and here we are with Ananya Pandey putting all the illogical statements about how she REALLY struggled. I mean. c&#39;mon. Just accept it ma&#39;am.

Ananya has no value of her job no dreams and goal she came in to film only for fame and money nt with passion n still she grows than the people who come into films with dreams bcz of biasness

When u become a doctor u study hard for 5 years... don&#39;t compare ur ur shitty acting with a prestigious profession like medicine

I feel Ananya doesn&#39;t give Tara chance to speak she kept talking over her or talking at the same time when Tara was talking

I am here after watching oye jassi episode 19😂😂  Tara sutaria, vishal jethwa and ahsaas channa , and that lil girl in that episode 🌺🌚

Her dad never went on koffee with karan and  never starred in a Dharma film but still managed to get her first film through Dharma, only..WOW..!!🤣

Fun fact: Every star kid wanted to be an actor since his/her childhood...🤣🤣

I came to watch this interview today after hearing for an entire year about Ananya&#39;s struggle and people trolling her for that. People had been trolling her saying that she said she had struggled a lot. But here, I couldn&#39;t find a single place where she says that she had struggled a lot. She just said &#39;Everyone has their own struggle&#39;, which is such a true statement. Struggle is a subjective term and everyone experiences it in a different way in life. I mean, are people trolling her for this comment, seriously??? 😑 In that case, either people are gaining sadistic pleasure by making an issue out of this and trolling her OR the IQ level of Indian audience has decreased drastically🙄

<a href="">57:53</a> ananya recognised that there is no acting in soty 2 ..

you know! you know! you know!

<a href="">27:22</a> : Chunky Pandey was a huge star ?? 🤫

i love the hosts kindness

Sidhant sir nailed it!

<a href="">41:40</a> the reason you r watching the video 😉Thank me later

God Tara&#39;s speech is so beautiful

&quot;Jaha hamare sapne pure hote ha waha inka  struggle shuru hota ha&quot;Wtf how can they ignore this savage line

I did not understand what siddhant said ..!?

<a href="">41:41</a>

Ananya immediately checked on Tara after Siddhant have his savage reply

Those searching for that one time stamp where Siddhant crushes all of Ananya&#39;s arguements, here u go<a href="">41:40</a>Enjoy 😂

The main reason why bollywood will we wiped out from indian map by 2024

If you watch this video with stereotypes, you will miss a lot of knowledge &amp; understanding

<a href="">48:38</a> &quot;...Tarzan-Warzan hai kya ye...&quot; 😂 Oo Bhaiii!P.S.: The animal-relating technique that they told about in this interview is very interesting &amp; amazing for me

Whenever I feel stupid in my life, I come into this comments section and spend some time. Honestly, I feel a lot better. Bcoz when I see that so many people consider &#39;Everyone has their own struggles&#39; and &#39;I&#39;ve struggled a lot&#39; as the same, I realize that I&#39;m not that dumb at least😅😅😅 1 saal se qtiyappa chal raha hai &#39;struggle&#39; ka social media mein lekin Ananya ne aisa kuch bola hi nahi thha. Wah bhai kya hi duniya mein jee raha hoon😌😌😌

What you&#39;re looking for starts at <a href="">41:41</a>

Ananya speaks so much and just doesn&#39;t stop. P.S. - and it is all crap too.

I am only for SIDDHARTHA MALHOTRA NEPOTISM DIALOGUE

Even her dad went through a difficult time after she was born 🤦🏻‍♀️ what is the telling

I laugh when someone say Toger shroff varun dhawan ananaya etc are actors or heroes 😂😂😂

<a href="">41:38</a>

Only here for Vishal Jethwa..such a sweet guy.

I mean people where so dumb to understand Siddhant statement

The thing is what Abhimanyu said is also true, each of us benefit by what our parents are. Somehow if you can excel on yourself than that&#39;s good, but otherwise parents do put in words, even they don&#39;t, others at position to reject you(like in a job), they do consider you more, if they know your parents. So I think no one should be judged and cancelled for just that.

Just for Siddharth Chaturvedi&#39;s one liner 😁😅🤟🤟✌️✌️
<a href="">41:35</a> 🤣🤣🤣
Vishal&#39;s eyes are so hypnotically beautiful. Wow.

Vishal💜💜💜💜

Avimanyu is quite good at acting as a starkid.. And he is humble and smart too..

I m here for vishal jethwa an inspiring motivation and in excellent actor

My dad has never been in a dharma film and he has not been on koffee with karan ???  Wow what a struggle for chunkey pandey .her wobbed  sense of reality is deplorable. Wonderful reply by siddharth ...

Vishal jethwa’s performance in Mardani 2 made me come to youtube, find this interview and write an appreciation comment:Great great great acting! Beautiful done! Absolutely amazing. Well done mate!!!

who is here for siddhants line to annanya

Iam listening only abhimanyu and siddhant voice

I know you&#39;re here for siddhart one liner but I would  recommend you to watch mardaani 2 and recognize vishal jethwa&#39;s talent.

Sidhant Chaturvedi said...
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to put Abhimanyu in the same class as Ananya. People were stalking her on social media even before she had movies. Place the blame with the people who made her a bankable &#39;personality&#39; simply for her looks that gave her the fame which eventually got her a Dharma movie. KJ puts his money on kids who he knows will sell tickets in theatres because people will buy a ticket to watch that movie even if it is to simply bi**h about the poor performance. Whereas Abhimanyu Dassani has been working on his craft regionally before people knew who his mother was. His sister had a bigger following than he did.

&quot;Her Dad didnt even congratulate her for her film&quot; 🥺🥺🥺
<a href="">41:40</a> What game did you play brother? 🙌🏻😁➡☝🏻Now Ananya Pandey is bigger than ever, look at her face! What an innocent face you have made as if you know how much you are doing ???
all the abandoned food and drinks on the table gives me depression lmao

Annanya&#39;s attitude and voice is 😡 she looks like a burger girl .. any one mimicry of her

Who came only for Anaya struggle

<a href="">41:52</a> 😂😂 Geetika&#39;s Kavi kehna chah rhe h ki is the most apt reaction to Sidhant&#39;s Savage-ness 😂😂🔥🔥

Nobody’s talking about Vidya and Saloni...they seem so charming and upbeat in real life

Its just me or anyone also noticed that that abhimanyu had crush on tara 😘😉 i just love the way he was seeing her and complemented he was actually smitten by her beauty

Took ananya minutes to understand this thing

Aka Anaya Pandey gets roasted 2019

Ananya is so irritating 🤭
I have come to hear the insults of Annoying Pandey.
Vishal jethwa talking in hindi
Everyone was so done when Ananya said she was 2 when she first got stars trucked🤣🤣🤣 rewatched that bit many times and it gets funnier every time. Specially he body language of other actors. 🤣🤣

I would have loved this interview if someone had edited Ananya Pandey..............The only talent she has is of talking unlimited bullshit. She speaks the most British version of Indianized English and she thinks it&#39;s cool. Such a fool

Tbh, if ananya didn&#39;t say that ONE sentence, this video was pretty much harmless and not once did i feel ananya was saying anything questionable except that one thing. But still that one sentence showed her mindset and how she has been brought up and its honestly sad cus she genuinely seems like a nice and understanding girl. its a bummer.

Ananya&#39;s roast is at <a href="">40:09</a> hit a like👇👇

I think we don&#39;t have problem with star kids we have problem with star kids who don&#39;t know how to act

Disclaimer : struggle isn&#39;t hurmmed during this interview 🤣

Ye kya bol rahe ki agar tera baap driver h to tu bhi driver

<a href="">41:47</a> Siddhant being savage😎And Vishal be like. Bhai bhai bhai🤣😂❤️

<a href="">41:29</a> is what you are here forThank me later 😁

So she means struggle is going to coffee with karan😂😂😂😂😂

<a href="">41:40</a>  Ladies and gentelment the moment you were waiting for 😆😆

ananya ;-  when i was 2 yrs old i screamed HRITHIK HRITHIK Le geetika , sid , vishal , abhimanyu expression :- KHUDA KA WASTA BEHAN PLS SACH BOL .. MARNE KEI BAAD UPARALE KO KYA MUH DIHAYE GI

This guys are try to be so over smart and didn’t understand the meaning of nepotism And let’s see who became outsider  star 🤔Except sid love u

i mean how can someone speak lies with such perfection .. dude ANANYA  ur friends have told regarding ur USC and NYC lie and still u comeout and speak infront of these people like they are all stupid there and dont know anything

I just don&#39;t know what was going on in siddhant&#39;s mind when ananya started the nepotism monologue edit (the best part of the whole scenario is when vishal agrees to siddhant after a second&#39;s silence on <a href="">41:47</a>)

Idk why abhimanyu looks like shreyas iyer a bit

“I never had a plan B , I always knew I wanted to be an actor ... I guess my parents had a lot for me” 😕😕😕 wow

This is where everyone came for <a href="">41:32</a>

Came here in 2021 for Ananya”s monolog

how the hell are you are gonna say you have a struggle while sitting between vishal and sid? wtf.

I like Geetika and Saloni&#39;s voice

Tara sutaria and Ananya Pandey don&#39;t belong here
Making &quot;Koffe with karan&quot; The Bar is like calling Ellen DeGeneres The best talking host 🤧😑

Can I just point out that someone like Ananya who grew up around actors who were successful, its obvious that her own father&#39;s slight lack of success really affected him and hence, her. Like please stop trolling the poor girl. Its mean spirited.

I am not here for &#39;what everyone is here for&#39;. I came to experience a good and healthy discussion, which I felt I did. Apni life mein bohut pressures pehle se hi hai, that&#39;s y I just look to spread positivity. So I&#39;m not a part of the &#39;anti-struggle squad&#39; who have overpowered this comments section. Please don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m a bit different. Koi mere jaisa bhi ho toh like ya comment kuch kar dena😅 taaki pata chale apun akela nahi jisko enjoy karne k liye kisi ka mazaak udaane ki zaroorat nahi hota😊

I ship vidya and saloni.....Damn

what did siddhant mean by that ?

Rajiv quickly went by nepotism question.. lol

So many ads, here for Siddhant one liner

Am I the only one who is here for siddhant honest line about Bollywood and nepotism

Guys its <a href="">41:25</a>

<a href="">41:44</a> just 3 seconds of a CA student destroyed whole remaining career of Ananya pandey

A single interview can destroy one&#39;s whole career

Ananya is definitely dumb
oh this is the masand the real killer of SSR

<a href="">41:41</a> is the thing u cam for

Siddhant ....luv u ...u r jus killer ....
I can&#39;t believe these people compared being a doctor to nepotism in the film industry. lol Matlab kuch bhi.  xDNo one can help you become a doctor. You have to earn it. haha

First, it was &quot;I work damn hard and I deserve this&quot;....later, &quot;my dad is supposed to look after me&quot;

&quot;A doctor starts with their mother or father in their dispensary...&quot; i need to sanitize my brain after this

Forget Ananya, the guy in denim jacket spoke shit too..  &quot;if u want to become a blacksmith go live with the blacksmith&quot; what the hell 🙄

👇This is how many times she said &quot;you know&quot;

Love Tara ,abhimanyu , Vishal and sidhant

Tara &#39;s so intelligent and opinated

Tara reminds me of Aishwarya Rai , Soo elegant and graceful

I just want to ask everyone a question...Everyone is saying nepotism, talking about the so called Nepo kids...I will take the example of Ananya itself. Her father saw the struggle then he got all the love and respect. When his daughter decided to go on the same path as her father what&#39;s the problem in it? The people who have seen the struggle when they have their kids and their kids decide to go on the same path of acting will then it not be nepotism? what will they say then...would they call Thier children a &quot; Nepo product&quot;... Every parents want to make their child&#39;s life easy, they don&#39;t want to let them see the struggle they saw..what&#39;s wrong in it..is struggle nessesary to get the love and sympathy?Whoever agrees with me just hit the like button 👍 I will get to know that I am not the only one who thinks like this🙂If some one could answer me please do..🙏Hope everyone gets what I want to say..the message I want to give.(No hatred towards anyone)🙂

<a href="">36:11</a> so mean of ananya interupting  others storyLook at abhimanyu and Saloni&#39;s reaction

Vishal was underrated in TV bcz the Ekta kapoor chamchas rule there and now getting underrated in bollywood as well bcz of strugglers like Ananya.

<a href="">41:41</a> 😂😂😂

<a href="">36:32</a>Tried and refused productions 💓

<a href="">43:27</a> Vishal ,Sidhant and Tara&#39;s face says it all

<a href="">41:41</a> Sidharth line op 😂😂
Bullshit! Ananya Panday is such a put off man! She looks &amp; talks like such a repulsive person! Show ka poora mood hee kharaab ker diya.. “ I always wanted to be an actor! 🙄🙄🙄! Yeah, sure with your eyes popping out of the socket! Haan aur mein toh abhi bhi Poo ke dialogues maarti hoon 🙄. Maarti hogi, dekhta kaun hai tujhe!?

Ma* hod diye bhaiyya ji💪
Tara, Sid are my favourite

tara looks beatiful even when crying

This show is like aao and ek dusre ki tareef karo.................And then feel like we are So intellectual

I think she&#39;s being quite honest about the situation. Cant blame her for being born in the film background. The rest, time will tell!

The moment of satisfaction <a href="">41:43</a>😂

Bahut hi struggling show hai bhai

Wo purple chips konse hai?

<a href="">41:43</a> “Where our dreams have become pure, our struggle has begun”, he said to everyone.
Abhimanyu Dassani was real good in Mard ko Dard nahi hota

Mardani wale launde ke bahar karo, the look that he is giving to Ananya, that scaring. Just kidding

Celebration one year of struggle

<a href="">41:40</a>....., Shut up (Ananya.)

The whole comment section is full of &quot;ananya pandey &quot;

<a href="">41:33</a> like plz😘😘😘😘😘👇
Vishal was the best of them

It&#39;s amazing to listen to sooooo many idiots barring one obviously

LEGENDARY🔥🔥 WORDS at <a href="">41:43</a>
Save your time <a href="">40:09</a>

Why isn&#39;t anyone talking about how Saloni bashed Ananya.... It was so sarcastic 🤣🤣.... Did you just missed it?

Abhimanyu literally has a crush on tara

So just because now that ananya has been to koffee with Karan, she thinks that she is more successful than chunky Pandey?

<a href="">41:41</a> if u came here for that

<a href="">4:08</a> seems like an afterthought , it&#39;s as if he realised that Ananya&#39;s movies don&#39;t for the previous category 😂

What abhimanyu said from 38 ..... is so true.Also what ananya said at 40.... was nothing wrong and she didn’t disrespect her dad in anyway. It’s not someone’s fault if their born into a film background. They have easy access to get into movies yes  but then how long and how successful they are depends on their hard work etc . Whereas people who have no film background work harder to into the movies at first. Struggle are from both side.

Where our dreams come true is where our struggle begins.....<a href="">41:44</a>
<a href="">41:42</a> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

koi to batao time of that one liner?

Ananya&#39;s biggest mistake is to going for this interview 😂

Siddhant:&quot;The difference lies in the fact that as our struggle ends, our journey begins&quot;. Ananya: haan ......and after that his laugh he's like abhi tumhe ye samjh nahi aayega jab kal banega memes upar hai but ye haan ka pta chalega.. घोटा
Ananya pandey:you know you know you know........🤣🤣🤣
I&#39;ll save the time for you <a href="">41:41</a>!!

I said to madharch*d to Vishal jethwa&#39;s character Really best actor for that character Only cuz of his acting

There also new comers in other field of film makingLike- director and more and more

Nawaz....to this kids ..... struggle dekh na hai ...marna hai

I can imagine sidhhant&#39;s silence

the best scene was <a href="">41:40</a>

the most savage comeback made by sid <a href="">41:43</a>

the famous meme line  <a href="">41:25</a>

i honestly dont have anything against ananya specifically. she seems sweet tbh. but shes also EXTREMELY ignorant. nepotism will always exist, but i just wish those who benefit from it would at the very least acknowledge it and prove that they deserve to have the position they hold. i actually wouldnt be surprised if chunky pandey and his family did struggle too tbh in their own way. everyone who&#39;s famous doesnt have it easy and i can understand that. but to equate her life to that of the people who truly actually struggle to get into the industry is just really ignorant. i wish all the star kids would just acknowledge their privilege and not try to speak over those who didnt have industry backing. it would make me respect them a hell of a lot more if they just, for lack of a better term, learnt when to shut the hell up

<a href="">1:10:13</a> the way vishal shushed abhimanyu was hILARIOUS

for what u camera here <a href="">41:42</a> thank me later haha

<a href="">41:42</a> thanks&#39;

These people not aware of India culture

Its a shame that Geetika Vidya Ohlyan had to sit with such untalented useless actors.

Similarity among all the star kids - they all make stupid statements and they don&#39;t have simple knowledge about the real world..

One year since Siddhant Chaturvedi&#39;s monumental one line post Ananya&#39;s Nepotism &#39;STRUGGLE&#39; Monologue. Just like Shashi Kapoor&#39;s one line post Amitabh&#39;s monologue 👏🏻

I don&#39;t even get free passes for an award function 😅😅🤣🤣

I love the beautiful voice Tara❤️❤️❤️
I knew I definitely knew ,  I was gonna find almost every comment about Ananya Pandey,😁😁

Do Struggle to know difference between dhaniya palak pudina meetha neem har kaali cheej
Guys comeonn, there should be nothing called strugulometer , everybody has their own struggle and being rich , being successful, being happy are different

Watching only sidhant&#39;s part, not listening to anyone else

Y nobody is eating the snacks

just for vishal and sid....

Kids..

Only one great actor understood Vishal😅

<a href="">41:40</a> true meme content we all saw

I like Tara !~💞💖💖💖💗💗💓
Everyone uses their privilege. That&#39;s human nature.. It&#39;s not inherently wrong. No one stops drinking water saying there&#39;s a drought somewhere else. The problem is when privileged people A. do not acknowledge their privilege... B. try to put down and take away opportunities purposefully from under privileged people... C. Not step back when they realize they are not good at what they gained through privilege.

Siddhant’s that line sums it all.

Everyone to Siddhant:- Maa Chodh diye bhaiya ji aap
Mc Sher se bajne ko tayyar maroon aunty🔥

Legendary line beginning in <a href="">41:41</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂

40.09 monologue
<a href="">59:31</a> ❣️
I wish Ananya was in the one with Sara and Jahnvi so we could see the 3 main star kids, and see if they were all similar or different

ananya is gorgeous nd have  positive attitude i like it😍

He slapped the shit out of her with that comment, kudos my brother, you&#39;ll get an extra aloo paratha at dinner tonight.

<a href="">41:43</a> i was only here for this

Tara and Vishal  worked in oye jessie in one of the episodes

where are Vardhan and Shivaleeka ...?

Guyss I think your life&#39;s are really sorted that&#39;s why you have time to judge Ananya do your own work first make your own career without nemotism then comment here👍

Abhimanu is a Actor with a positive personality

Chunky's entire money was wasted.
When Tara said she auditioned for alladin and then when siddhant and ananya said they auditioned too were they joking or did they actually audition for alladin too?

Tara sutaria is so reserved...ananya is very excited to be in Bollywood and it shows...tara is so dull shes like not intested in anyone and any conversation never  joins in it...she&#39;s like oh I was planning to go abroad when soty happened ...she&#39;s trying to show that I don&#39;t really care abt cheap bollywood I&#39;m too hi fi with my english and accent and u guys are below me

No one is safe from Hrithik Mania
Rajeev Bhasand
Vishal is soo honest and soo soo soooooooo cute...... 😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍

Abhimanyu is ignorant about nepotism debate yes he doesn&#39;t come from the same tunnel but he&#39;s not understanding the context..they are not covering the issue from all the facets

Respect to vishal for being the realest on the table

T will be a bollywood actor one day.....

Dumb Ananya saying TQ FOR CONGRATULATIONS 😹🤣😂😂😂😂
vishal jethwa is ma fav

Mc sher can play narendra modi as he looks much like him

Bahi vishal..maza agaya...apki hindi ekdum fadu hei aur aap bohot bollywood hit ho...liked u👍
Hate tara ....fake people..rest all actors have talent...Anaya still at least has some points to speak ...tara shud become English teacher..even she chooses &#39;olive &#39; to eat rather than eat indian stuff...she star struck with some unknown guy from uk....urghhhhhhhhhh get out of India !!!!!!!

Love the green shirt guy ...he speaks hindi ...true indian

Ananya was on the table to get mocked by others🤣

Gandiwaaalii beizzati..🤣🤣🤣
Can anyone say why people hate on ananya Pandey so much.....not because I&#39;m her fan or anything but I just really want to know?

Love tara

Ananya: &quot;My father has never been to Koffee with Karan&quot;.Sidhant: &quot;Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru&quot;.

Ananya blacksmith HatessT_T≥﹏≤
I love the way that most of them are so grounded and self-aware. It is very rare you see that in people of our own age or younger. In this age of seeking other&#39;s approval, its great to see them being confident in who they are in spite of their acting careers.

Bejjati x10000
Everyone coming at Ananya while she is talking about really legitimate problems and gracefully accepts it when people point out her privilege

I&#39;m here for abhimanyu ❤️❤️He is charming and humble

<a href="">41:31</a> thank me later.

<a href="">41:45</a> main line
Ananya Pandey : I have struggled a lotChunky Pandey : Mamma miya shes a joking😂

<a href="">41:40</a> if you are here just for Sid&#39;s one liner 😂

Ananya&#39;s accent is dammmmmm irritating like literally very irritating..Tara n Vishal much love to them

Who all came just to see ananya&#39;s struggle😂😂

Good for nothing bunch of people. Do these people really deserve this kind of attention?

Poor taste these ppl have already !  These kids shud hv hd studies instead of attending parties with their parents ! Y DO THEY ALL HAVE UCH A LOW IQ ???

You are here for this <a href="">41:26</a>Thank me later 😉

<a href="">41:38</a> is that Munna tripathi&#39;s wife?🤔

Acting like they have achieved oscar or something, This is common in bollywood HYPOCRISY at its best

When at <a href="">6:47</a> ananya said that she had no plans and always wanted to become an actor. The next thing that she told...&quot;my parents thought that I wasn&#39;t serious&quot; LMAOoo😂😂😂

Why vardhan puri not there🙄☹️

This is where the dialogue comes from <a href="">41:42</a>
Struggle 🤣🤣🤣
Siddhant gave it to my mouth bhai choked her
Brother I fucked my mother
<a href="">41:44</a> nailed it Siddhant Chaturvedi...

Intelligent person might speak pure EnglishBut Pure English doesn&#39;t mean that the person is intelligentYou can relate a person by this video

Just me or does Abhimanyu Dasani seem like a pretentious idiot.

So Ananya says she struggled a lot bcoz her father had never been in a dharma film or on koffee with Karan that’s why it’s difficult for her. And what about others, whose parents don’t even know about this industry neither do they belong to it. Huh! Struggle!

Love you.. Anayana ❤️❤️❤️❤️
vishal is trying so hard to not insult ananya

see all the people who think that everyone hates nepotism truth is we don&#39;t... we just hate actors who do not deserve to be in the industry but are their just because their parents are in the business... good products of nepotism are always encouraged.

Don&#39;t know why but ananya pandey sounds so fake

Can someone translate sidarath comment please. A Indian cinema fan from Ethiopia. Plss

Ananya : you know ( after every line she said) People : ya we know,,😆😆😆
abhimanyu is the only actor (star kid) who actually struggles it took him years to star in a movie plus it was a good movie instead of a dharma

sid gave words to vishal chetwa  for what he want to say

<a href="">41:44</a> NOT  just this industry Nepotism is the story of every industry even every home. Havent you heard of the idiom CHARITY STARTS FROM HOME . Nothing new , it is just the media making playing with our minds to earn money

<a href="">41:44</a> thank me later.

Vishal jethwa is very talented then struggler Pandey  I am here only for vishal

I loved Siddhant&#39;s expression through out  the nepotism and struggling topic... He was like &quot;haaa!! ye karlo pehle&quot;😂

<a href="">41:42</a>😎😎😎
Downfall of Bollywood started from here

<a href="">45:49</a> cute 😍😍😍
Student of the year 2... a major MESS.....and Ananya Pandey too...Rip KJo

Please stop writing hate comments on Ananya Pandey , I am tired of liking them😂😂😆😆

Aye to tatti he...😂

&quot;My dad never worked in a dharma film🎞,he never went to koffee with karan&quot; — wow the struggle is real guys!

Only Vishal Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Yar kya acting ke ha
Who is the blue lady in extreme right ?

can someone tell me what is that chips like things on table?? purple, yellow, red ?

The best was not the dialogue by Ishaan khatar but the silence after it

<a href="">41:40</a> :- Best line of the interview 🤭🤘🤘🤘

Those people following Ananya..... &quot;Koun he ye log kahan se aate he ye..... &quot;

Tara, Vishal and Siddhant are my favorites❣️

Ananya Pandey thinking... &quot;Why the hell am i here? &quot;

Annanya was talking about her father&#39;s struggle. Where was her struggle?😆

Why are ananya and tara there they dont deserve

Struggle part so funny 😂😂😂
Am I the only one who&#39;s impressed with Abhimanyu?

ananya is just saying that here father is making here life like what make your own life

these people really do not understand that we are the one who watch there movies we know if you are good at acting or not ,and anaya pandey you are just mad about the fact that people tell you the truth

Krk does a YouTube channel, who do you like? Sorry, I have made so much fun about the movie Mardaani 2, I have said so much bad things, what should I do now but, I like Mardaani and also Krk but I should not have spoken like that, I am so talented. Nah, that macho man speaks like that in any movie.😒😒😒
the mardaani 2 is so much nice that i want to see it again and again mardaani 2 is again giving in star gold 2 on sunday 11 october 2020 at 1 :00 pm

All of you so pure soul and no hate for each other

Only your dad chunky panday workd hard . Not you.. u can&#39;t even know , what&#39;s d actual struggle ..

It's overacting, Ananya, please don't let me kill you. Where do you learn acting from please?
A product of nepotism

Ananya Pandey has not yet understood what is the struggle..?
Here it is <a href="">41:39</a>

I&#39;m here for VISHAL JETHWA ONLY!!

<a href="">41:23</a> Thank me later!!!
i wish someone talked about geetika. she had unnao written on hand. we need influencers who actually care about such issues and are ready to take a stand and spread awareness. hats off!

is it me or abhimanyu is whipped for tara?

Ananya sounds like sonam kapoor 😃
Ananya is actually really sweet,cause I have never seen her throwing her attitude around.She seems like a person who likes to keep people happy.Prolly she is not a great actor but she seems to have a really nice personality and seems very authentic.

<a href="">14:12</a>😊😊
Tara sis (cuz there is only 11yrs age gap between us) is like the heroine of my life. I have grown watching her on Disney and I was very happy that a beauty like tara is coming to this industry; and not only bcuz of her beauty but also bcuz of her personality, talent and mainly her hard work cuz she is not a star kid and she must have taken a lot of hard work to reach till here.But tara is 999999999999999999999999 times better than those nepotism obsessed star kids like ananya, she is not a good actor, she is here only bcoz of nepotism (talking abt ananya). But seriously tara should become  the most popular actress mostly in the whole world  and she has ability to become. Love you tara. One of ur craziest fan❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Be careful ananya the table might break lol queen

Ananya&#39;s monologue proves that how much she likes Kartik Aaryan

i have a question...why is no one eating those delicious looking snacks?? like not even one?

<a href="">41:47</a> nice try to cover 😂😂

Full force on ananya Pandey 🧐🧐😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I don&#39;t know why but i was feeling more uncomfortable when ever miss pandey open ups her dirty mouth and specially in the struggle wala part😂....

I just watched thappad and geetika vidya ohlyan has become my fav even if she played such a small role but that chipkali ananya yuck........geetika deserves more popularity than that <a href="">chipkali.now</a> that chipkali&#39;s struggle begins and i skipped every part of chipkali

<a href="">41:40</a> yea the line u wanted to hear😂

just go to <a href="">41:40</a> ..you will find what u need .....your welcome...

Ananya pandey💩💩
The guy in glasses is so bitter.

Came after watching the sushant part in the round table conference 2016...seeing this makes me question why I even come here

But you gotta agree Ananya speaks very well her English is very good and grammatically correct

just here for <a href="">41:44</a> you rock bhai

Came here for Tara 😍...but I was stunned seeing her sitting beside Vishal ☺️ they have worked together in an episode in Oye Jassie 😊&amp; now sitting side by side on the newcomers roundtable really...they r amazing....May they get a lot of success &amp; love😍😍

Dad, dada laga rakha hai. Khud hi nepotism ko boost kar rahi hai. Dharma productions iska moksh hai. We all are proud of our dads, who even work so hard that your father can&#39;t even imagine.

Iske sath baitkar biggest day of your life? Lol

<a href="">41:40</a> This scene deserves a <b>ohhhhhhhh</b> sound in background 😂

No more round tables MR. MASTAN?? Scared to get exposed?? <a href="">#justiceforSSR</a>

I came here only to hear Ananya&#39;s sad struggle story, what an emotional story

This month should be transformed into a meaningless month.
Anaya - struggle 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
<a href="">1:11:02</a> sidharth 😂❤️❤️
Just look at ananya&#39;s face after sid&#39;s one liner😂😂

Tara Sutaria &amp; Anannya Pandeys work Vs saloni batra &amp; Geethikha work at Soni.. should there be a comparison??I like Abhimanyu.. i didn&#39;t know he&#39;s bhagyashree&#39;s son. But he worked wonderfully at Mard ko Dard..And Ananya Pandey ji ki struggle..pura duniya sharma gayi hain

maybe dipensable only was the right word@<a href="">28:06</a>

Pandey g spoke some hindi...english competition nai hote sarey interview
Savage yet subtle comeback to ananya&#39;s so called struggle by siddhant at <a href="">41:40</a>

She is very humble and down to earth. Not every star kid should be trolled. Theek hai new hai seekh jaegi. Atleast ghamandi nai hai. Jab koi pilot ya govt office Mai kaam karne Wala apne Bache ko jugaad se naukri dilata hai tab hum kyu nai kuch bolte?!

YAHI MAARI GYI THI NA ANANYA JI KI 😂

They all are raw and pure and know how to acknowledge each other. Few years down the line things will be much different

sabse bada jhand untalented admi isme hai abhimanyu dassani bc na face na acting na dance ek number ka nithalla or chtuiya !

<a href="">41:30</a>. Siddharrth 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am here for one and only, most talented Vishal ❤️

Koi ananya ko maaro over smart sali😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Ohhh god ananya make me very irritated  I only love vishal anx siddharth

Who is here for annaya&#39;s struggle story

ℊ𝓊𝓇𝓁𝓁𝓁𝓁𝓁𝓁𝓁𝓁  Ananya went on and on and on 𝗚𝗢𝗗 plz save me she went on with a metro speed <b>ˢᵒ ᵗᵃˡᵏᵃᵗⁱᵛᵉ</b>
My dad my dad my dad....same something else as well

<a href="">40:09</a>Ananya Pandey : My dad has done so much hardwork. I know from what my dad had gone through. I am proud to be his daughter.

Me : Yes, he has done hardwork but what have you done? Nothing?

Ananya looks beautiful 😍😍😍
Geetika is the most talented actress out the all 4 girls.....  she has proved herself both in soni as well as in  thapadd ....where she played the maid....

I was so scared of Vishal after watching Mardaani 2. What a performance he gave !!

<a href="">41:42</a> Siddhant Chaturvedi&#39;s epic line 😂

Yaar, it’s not an issue of nepotism. That shit is everywhere. The real issue is movies like Chichorre not getting the attention NOR awards. Recently, Vidyut Jamwal not getting invited and ignored for Kudda Hafiz- If you think another actor did a better job than you, don’t accept the award, especially not pay for it!

<a href="">54:01</a> se <a href="">54:09</a> if you know what I mean lol hahahahahah

Came here after watching Soni - brilliant film and great work by the two ladies. Also, they have messed up dispensable and indispensable forever. Tara corrected Ananya, really?

Rajeev Masand is talking about the struggle of star kids? seriously? he is biased for sure!!

Tara = Calm &amp; Quite Vishal = Learner Ananya = Childish Siddharth = Confident Geetika = IntelligentAbhimanyu = Smart Saloni = innocent P.S : I m talking about their nature

No one:Ananya: I wanted to be Shanaya

Vishal ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Soni movie great geetika and her IPS

Great movie of geetika vidya soni
is it just me someone else also ship siddhant and annanya now :D i know its dumb but it&#39;s so fun to ship people:D

WHY WE D0NT WANT T0 APPRECIATE???   ANS- BECAUSE WE ARE 0BSSESD WITH HATE                                                                SACHHI MAIN GUYS WE NEED T0 APPRECIATE THE WRK 0F THESE ARTIST AND IGN0RE BAD 0NES&lt;3

This is not to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but it is a reality today. Please don&#39;t think that I am against new actors but according to me this is the truth. Even we as audience support nepotism. Everyone giving comments against nepotism we all support it. How many of you recognized the new actors after their first film but we all recognize the nepotism kids even before their first film. Nepotism occurs in every field example if your parents own a company they will obviously hand it over to you if you want to continue with business then why do we have a issue here. If we can give the country in hand of nepotism i.e., congress party every time then why do we have a problem when there is nepotism in bollywood.

Why isn&#39;t ananya letting him complete the question 😂😂

Ananya meant that her father was not a very big actor like Akshay, Salman and Shahrukh and he used to get small roles in movies and not the lead roles even after being a good actor,  so for Ananya it was a very big deal to get a movie in DHARMA and in order to make her father proud she had to work hard and make a stability in the Bollywood industry... She just used the word struggle  instead of hard work.... But she would have got trolled either way...... But I got what she said and meant......

Ananya is a very innocent girl....  Whatever she said,  she meant something else, it came out something else and people understood something else.....

Siddhanth and vishal are tolerating ananya and they are being irritated by her is evident from their expressions whenever she talks

I dont know anyone in this interview just came from tik tok

Came from tik tok

Rajeev Masand wrote blind items about Sushant

Vishal and Tara have worked together in oye Jessie that time Vishal looked like a kid and Tara well she still looks the same...

&quot;Working in Dharma and Koffee with Karan &quot;... should b the motto of every newcomers...bravo ..u achieved it <a href="">#Pandey</a>... learn something from her yaar...kya timepass kar rahe ho ..Tum log bhi...🤣🤣

Sister, how many notes do you make?
People pls understand the fact what ananya meant, she meant that her father was not a very big star like srk, salman , aamir or akshay kumar, her father used to get supporting roles in movies rather than getting lead roles and that too even after having so much acting skills.... So she just wanted to say that for her getting a movie in dharma was a very big deal and to make her father proud she had to prove herself as a good actress.... So she used the word struggle..... Pls stop trolling her and that too without even knowing what she said and Siddhant Chaturvedi himself accepted that whatever he said was not to troll ananya ,the lines he said was just a closing statement....

Saving time for u all<a href="">41:43</a>

I am here for Vishal

Vishal Jethwa most powerful performer..🔥
Vishal should have got best debut

What made you think Ananya Pandey should be interviewed alongwith amazing actors like Vishal jethwa and siddhant chaturvedi? Tell me honestly, can&#39;t you see the difference in their acting? I used to appreciate you a lot, was always waiting to see your movie reviews..But after this whole SSR case and your cheap act of writing blind items have made me think about my perspective about you.You&#39;ve lost your credibility Rajeev masand!!!! Please have some guts to be a genuine movie critic and stop favouring nepotism like Karan johar...

You know lablablab.... You know lablablab....... We know you are struggle queen okay😕🤣🤣🤣

Where is pranutan baal and zaheer iqbal they r also new comers aren&#39;t they ????

Kisine bhi snacks nahi khaye? Siil jaenge yar kya kar rahe ho, mausam kharab hai. Jaise ki koi bhi fresh chiz plated, and served siil jati hai without being consumed in the industry.

Only for you ananya Ignore haters I love you

Om my god vishal is so cute and also tara is so well mannered..i really liked her elegance

This lady literally irritated me ...my dad my dad.ufff😵😵

Come on naked Pandey..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Abhimanu to bus line but it is on Tara.
Tara speaks like a Barbi doll
Ananyas Pandyas voice n her English accent n  that fake confidence she is trying to show ..ugh somebody take her out of there plz.

Rajeev masand is a dog who wags his tail when Karan Johar tells him to go fetch and also when he throws a bone (money) at him. Useless guy.

Vishal Jethwa is an amazing actor!! He had a really tough role as a beginner he nailed to the core

Whenever I see Rajeev Masand, Payal&#39;s words sounds in my mind &#39;Ek Motta sa bhadda sa reporter&#39;

<a href="">41:42</a>.....Everyone could relate except Ananya lol.......DRAMA QUEEN~~

why are sbke ears red🤔🤔🤔
I am here only for Vishal Jethwa

You are the torch bearer of nepotism in bollywood. Anyway most of the common man dislike your opinion.

M happy atleast Smone speak in Hindi also

Ananya need some medications..bring her back chanki and take her some chatni of pudina😁😁😁😁

Hrithik &amp; Shahid, he also acts like this on starkids, if he is getting a film, then it is good but he is not the star kid, why are they making him a star?
<a href="">41:42</a> is the part of this video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂✌️

Here just for sidhant 💖💖

first of all ananya pandey doesnt deserve to sit between siddhanth and vishal.

She did not even know that the MC sher  hit the taunt on her <a href="">41:40</a> well shot

I support Nepotism! I have helped from my office staff, driver, munshiji.
Hey brother, please speak Hindi also....
No oneLiterally no oneMe: Why are they not eating the delicacies.😂😂😂😂

U should have called another ananya that is ananya birla the so called selfmade singer like  lol

Cringing at how Tara Sutaria corrects Ananya Pandey’s usage of the word DISPENSABLE when Ananya actually used it right.

I am hear for anu she is my fav🥰😘 Bollywood actress and i don&#39;t know why everyone hate her because of nepotism  she didn&#39;t do anything wrong

Siddhant... Vishal's elder brother is coming...
All of us the VISHAL jethwa is the best non nepotism

If there is anyone here for finding the word of struggle which got the meme so don&#39;t watch it full just go to <a href="">40:40</a> you would get easily there

<a href="">41:28</a> onwards.. for a short while hiding my face in disbelief..

Ananya Pandey == Tatti
41.42 the epic line 🔥🔥🔥

Ananya pandey&#39;s only struggle was against her mother&#39;s willingness to not &#39;push&#39;. Also, Alia loves GRASS.

Who is here after listening to Rohit Shetty&#39;s description of Sara Ali Khan&#39;s &quot;struggle&quot; to get cast in Simmba?

How else is here for that one line of siddhant&#39;s ?Or am I the only one ?

Vardhan Puri and Shivaleeka Oberoi didn&#39;t even get invited to thisBollywood really ignored &#39;Yeh saali aashiqui&#39; - one of the most underrated gems of 2019

<a href="">#boycottrajeevmasand</a> This guy shamelessly wrote blind article about SSR Sushant Singh Rajput , called him skirt chaser and did his character assasination. Let&#39;s not see or listen to his any of his interview. Totally corrupt fellow

I think no one got the one liner by siddhant except abhimanyoo...

Tara ❤️❤️❤️
wow I came to see Ananya Pandey but Siddhant Chaturvedi literally just stole my heart

Ananya just ruined the whole atmosphere by defending nepotism.

Siddhant Chaturvedi, Abhimanyu dassani, because of them I am seeing this video. Both have the good acting skills 🙂🙂

Sushant too deserved to be the part of this.

Naveen polishetty should have invited to this interview, he did such good work in chhichhore movie.If anyone agree to this like it👍

Siddhant sir is so impressed with other&#39;s sitting besides him .., except ananya pandey,😂

Despite of being amazing actors.....they have plan B Inside annaya - i have karan johar

Idiotic film critic and blind article writer

<a href="">41:45</a>☺️😜😜😜😅😂👍👍👍👍👍
I don't understand this society, these people can't talk like normal people, is there always a need to speak in fake accent, are the rest of the people speaking a little bit better, but Ananya is continuing to teach them English nonstop.
This year started with Ananya&#39;s struggle memes...and now we have Sadak 2 dislike trend...2020 is a bad year for Star kids..2020 is a bad year for all tho, but I never thought that it impact even these rich star kids...

Pro tip .. Watch last 15 mins ....bet u will laugh

These star kids looking  like fools in front of outsiders , by this age these outsiders who are sitting in the room would have seen the world through their struggle.just born as star kid, got karan johar movie, attend the parties and hire a reporter to be in news in air port looks, gym looks, then come in BMW give interviews ..even their movies won&#39;t click , get 100 chances before thy fail as actor, even after 100 chances they don&#39;t prove, they have papa&#39;s money ..... wow what a struggle.

sidhanth smile  when he said the most famous struggle dialogue :D...  ananya did n&#39;t even understood what he meant.

Struggled good actors are sitting with nepo non struggle er actors

<a href="">41:40</a>

<a href="">41:47</a> ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😂😂😂

My respect for Vishal jethwa just doubled.

<a href="">41:41</a> ua looking for...if everyone wud laughed at that time Ananya wud runaway crying 😁
Only siddhant chaturvedi will have a long career but as a supporting actor not a lead one. Vishal might be TV actor. All others will disappear in a few years.

Rajeev masand is a part of Bollywood nexus

The correct word is dispensable i.e you can be replaced. Indispensable means irreplaceable. SMH.

Ananya pandey struggle is so so much painful😅😂🤣

No one laughed on Siddharth&#39;s one liner,they didn&#39;t understood or were just controlling themselves??But that moment when Siddharth said was epic 💖💫

They are talking about pressure of what outfit to wear 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
<a href="">41:40</a> 😂😂

Ananya was right when she said dispensible which means, able to replace. Why tara is being over smart &amp; saying indispensible.

Vishal, Vishal and only Vishal. For him I am watching.He gave his brilliant performance in Mardaani 2.

Aanya pandey the most overacting girl among all

Rajeev Masand annoying panda

Vishal🥰🥰
Her voice is so irritating man

rajeev masand is a fake person!!!!!!!!!! another byproduct of nepotism ...........

Nonsense Ananya Pandey... talent kya he na apni tounge se nose ko touch karsaktehen hun....are yr ye b koi talent he...Bo to kuta b karleta he

All nepotism not a single outsider...

Mc Sher rocks💥💥💥💥💥
<a href="">41:41</a> Thank me later
Round table baitha ke jese desh ki tarhaki ke bare mein baat kar rhe hai..!!! Bakwass talks

It's funny how the moment he said &quot;Tujhko Mirchi Lagi toh Main Kya karun&quot; 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
I&#39;m here only for sidhart one liner famous dialogue

What did our lion say? (<a href="">41:40</a>)Akal ke kuch log ko kuch samaj mein nahi aya hoga.HAHAHA
Isn&#39;t that girl in wine red blazer is the naukrani from thappad

Ananya is the odd one in this and I think she should not about to sit between these self made stars....... And her so called struggle is showing that she is just on Karan&#39;s aashirwad.. Otherwise she was never meant to be in Bollywood and she can&#39;t... 🙄

Ananya pandey is so dump
How many of u know that Vishal Jethwa is the same boy from Peshwa Bajirao which streamed on Sony channel? 😍😍😍

Who is after gem Sushant’s death ?

These all 3 boys are fire..they should be appreciated like star kids

'Hindi' The language 'Hindi' was created for understanding people to speak. The people who want to work in the film are called 'hindi'; I don't know what shame I feel while speaking...
If you don't use it then it would be very difficult to create a platform.
Agar Vishal Jethwa ko nhi bhulate is on the platform to create ruckus.
Roses are red Violets are blue Sid roasted AnanyaYou should too

Rajeev masand please loyal to your job n believe God is seeing all your games

Is it only me or someone else...who gets irritatated by just hearing the voice of Ananya😑🥴😡

donkey...kahika
Why Saloni is sugarcoating Ananya?!  -_-

Lots of love to abhimanyu dassani. Please watch mard ko kabhi dard nahi hota. Inspite being a starkid he is super talented not like ananya pandey

<a href="">41:43</a> Sid just took one monologue to complete change the gear of thhe conversation. I knew the &quot;Mangal Pandey&quot; within him would rise. (coz of his birthplace)😉 but this was supported by Masand and that&#39;s shocking.

Whole interview Ananya Pandey&#39;s constant chatter &quot;MY DAD&quot;just pissed me off so much....Dharma film could get shelved!!?!!....justifying her position.....what a big off.

<a href="">41:40</a> 🤟🔥🔥🔥
D best part in gully boy was Siddhartha rap part...Apart from this film is🤑😥

Bloody Masand
Boycott Suraj Pancholi, Salaman Khan, Aditya Chopra, Mahesh Bhatt &amp; Karan Johar
Vishal is very genuine 😊😇 I loved him💘

Ek baat notice karna jab sidhant ne bola woh line toh Anaya ko pta bhi nahi laga ka bola that how dumb she is and whole conversation he is very quiet and suddenly he say silent everyone for a while

What kind of logic is this &quot;Every engineer's son is an engineer or a businessman's businessman.&quot;Acting is not anyone's inheritance. Acting is under Bandey key hoti hai sekhi ya pari nahi jati.
We will kill everyone, we will not see how we will see it.
Vishal Jethva was excellent in mardani,Infact I started hating him.Sucha innocent young <a href="">kid.How</a> beautifully he played a  cruel psycho character.

Hey friend, I am struggling a lot to do this,😜🤣
Where is Mrunal Thakur from Love Sonia??? Radhika Madan???

STAR KIDS are no more going to be role model who have zero struggle, fake publicity &amp; instant opportunity. Otherwise shame on us

Bollywood is fake and very instant alternate career option for STAR KIDS for their economic stability without any struggle or educational qualification.

Gadhi..low IQ girl, you don't know that a doctor's son passes the exam to become a doctor, that's why he doesn't become a doctor by showing his body😡😡😡😡
<a href="">41:40</a> 𝓣𝓱𝓾𝓰 𝓵𝓲𝓯𝓮 SIDDHANT 😂😂 He trolled Anaya only in 2 sentences 😂
I Am Going To End Women A Whole Carrier <a href="">41:42</a>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When tara and ananya start tackling, it’s irritating 😠

She is really stupid

<a href="">2:48</a> chal nikel ayi kiyu
Sidhaarth one line nukes on Aanaya pandey statement on nepotism

Love you Tara Sutaria 😇
I am only here for sidhant

Sab chutiye hai..

Mc Rajeev masand <a href="">#justice</a> for SSR

<a href="">41:40</a> You searching for this

<a href="">41:26</a> - <a href="">41:40</a>

<a href="">41:40</a> one liner

Oh my God, very deserving Ananya Pandey is also here🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, she is angry after seeing this.
siddhant n vishal
Vishal he’s amazing, stole hearts in Maardani 2. He deserves an interview alone not with start kids that are too far behind his taken.

Vishal and the other guy don’t  belong to that table, they’re just too good to be called just as (newcomers)

Shame on u Rajiv masand
Aanaya accent is very fake.

Rajeev machar mota ghatiya hippo support nepotism chat ta hai criminals k

The    <b><i>Anchor</i></b>    was more    <b><i>Irritating</i></b>    than Pandey ji

<a href="">45:48</a> true ya she was looking beautiful even when she was crying but why annoying pandey is interrupting her stupid 🙄 she is soo insecure 😑

Bhosdiwala Masand
Well said Siddharth.. ❤️
Best answer mc sher
Who keeps all this food happily?
Rajeev Masand had sex with so many B grade actress and his wife is so ignorant about it.  A journalist himself a charactless and who would believe in his journalism.  His own family is ignorant about his doings. Sex addict Rajeev Masand.

I timestamped all the Vishal jethwa moments so that u guys don&#39;t have to find it ! <a href="">7:04</a><a href="">13:21</a><a href="">20:05</a><a href="">24:43</a><a href="">49:24</a><a href="">1:01:16</a><a href="">1:08:35</a><a href="">1:10:24</a>

Rajeev masand, do you write BLIND ARTICLES ?  if you do, shame on you.Stop it , otherwise we the people will pull you down.

I won&#39;t spent even an one rupee coin on Ananya pandey movie.

Rajeev masand, stop writing BLIND articles your bad time has started already.

<a href="">41:41</a> the line you all came for 🤙

Vishal&#39;s acting skills 💯😍
Being a star kid with zero talents( Oh sorry! Actually she has talents..she can touch her nose with tongue😂)  Without any struggles she entered the film industry that too got dharma production film..But calls herself as struggler..!😒And so what if ur father has not bèen on kwk...And seriously couldnt tolerate her accent..

Who thinks Rajeev masand is little older version of Karan Johar

Rajeev masand wrote n said all . Sushant had a series of cowardly blind items written about him that could have broken even the toughest of spirits. He was called a skirt chaser, unprofessional, some claimed that his films were duds, one even named him in a <a href="">#metoo</a> accusation and called him a rapist. Sushant had to post screenshots of his chat with the alleged victim to prove that he was innocent. Can you imagine what he must have gone through in the nights and days leading to this death? This middle class boy from Patna, a few years in maximum city, working hard to realise his dreams; but he had to expend all that energy, relentlessly fighting this dirty, unfounded slander.

The guy in the denim jacket. He is just one example who probably was shit anyway which is why he had a few struggles. The difference is that star kids are so detached from reality. And they don’t even realise or acknowledge their privilege. They get elevated to opportunities that the ordinary person does not get unless they have the contacts and are able to network in the privileged circles.

Rajeev Masand... Sala Isla face pa hi kaminapan dekhta ha...
Mad woman ...... Siddhant&#39;s comment is not understood.....(ANANYA)  Because you spend money on your face…. Beyond education.  Everyone has a plan B …… Madam has nothing…… overconfidence… .. dumb…

Rajeev Masand, A big scoundrel
This msg is for Rajeev. I think you have heard by now about Kangana&#39;s interview with Goswami.

I was sad to hear that you were responsible for the negative false and bullying &quot;blinds&quot; that you posted for the public to read about Sushant Singh Rajput. Certainly you must have not only been paid to do this but you gladly must have done so out of jealousy. Afterall, how talented handsome and intelligent honest and down to earth was/is Sushant. There was no other male star who could compare. 

I used to enjoy your videos and writing. 

I will never read or listen to your work again.

Personally, I hope your career in Bollywood is over. 

You have contributed to the &quot;systematic dismantling of a fragile mind&quot;.

Sushant was a noble soul. India has lost a real gem who was invested in helping children and women in India. 

He had not even reached his peak.

Shame on you Rajeev.

Vishal was just 🔥I was really scared of him haha I couldn&#39;t get him off my mind 2days after watching movie,

<a href="">41:40</a> you&#39;re welcome

Why was Ankita Lokhande was not invited to this roundtable. She debuted too with Manikarnika.

14;25

Rajeev masand Shame on You

Sushant Singh Rajput made it possible &amp;  paved the way for artists like Siddhant Chaturvedi, Radhika Madan, Vishal Jethwa, Mrunal thakur &amp; many more. 🙏

Ananya&#39;s accent irritated the hell out of me.

Ha ha ??? Ananya has been exposed
How many matches did Ananya get?👇👇👇
<a href="">45:54</a> You are like a puppy. Hahaha.....

Siddharth you killed it ananya ki bolti band 😂😂

Actually Ananya is right, everyone can be replaced in this industry that&#39;s why she is already replaced to the sonam (karma😝) kapoor very soon

Who is here after our dear sushant left us ?

Ananya and Tara be like - Yeh Kis line mei aaye hum??? Is this not a party?? All the actors are here.
Ananya Pandey: m a struggling star!Chunkey Pandey: Mammma Miyaaaaa.....SHE&#39;S LYING!😂🤣🤣
<a href="">41:40</a> you came here for this😂

RAJEEV M.  U R  BUSTED

<a href="">41:43</a> OOHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Star kid inspiration will definitely a star kid ananaya aliya zero IQ 😈😈😈

<a href="">41:47</a> Siddhant also likes, jiski maarni thi main maar li. Ab tum bhaitke silao
Andheri, Dharavi, nallasopara ???
Hahahaha look at these oll anchor are nepotism evrythng

You are here for <a href="">41:40</a> 😃

Actually they all are very talented except ananya😅

I like Vishal , sidhant and abhimanyu

&quot;Movies that are very good vs Movies that were very successful vs Movies that people are talking about it&quot;So sad there is a lot of difference in them

To be really honest i just watched this whole video for only abhimanyu , siddhant,and vishal they deserve a lot i wish them all the luck abhimanyu is too down to earth and probably for me he is the best product of nepotism atleast for me.😊

I just like tara among them

I think this starkids should be banned...They r responsible for SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT&#39;s  murder😭😭

Star kids struggle..WHAT A JOKE!!!!
At <a href="">40:09</a> Ananya startAt <a href="">41:44</a> Sidhant be like &#39; Chal hat behen ki lodi&#39;

<a href="">41:34</a> the part u came for ...no need to waste ur time

The red and black lady is very annoying

Why u guys r ashemed to eat,,eat something,

Zero acting skills tara sutaria,ananya pandey and varun dhawan.All nonsense and their leader rajiv masand,useless man follower of nepotism.

Ananaya 🤮🤮😷🤣🤣🤣
Who is Watching in corentine

ananya you took your fathers name and joined industry ok dont need to be very kind if u want to be kind be with sara ali khan and choose the right movie next time. sara is  cheap thats what you said  u dont desearve it  u dont desearve nepotism or anything

i don&#39;t know why people are mentioning tara in nepo product Even for a fact, just like Sushant, Tara is multitalented, She knows Opera Singing, Ballet Dancing, Latin Ballet dance, knows how to play 3 instruments (Fun fact: she can play 2 at a time), Amazing Cook, good actor (Made it to top 2 for Aladdin, whose auditions were held worldwide), n also a good sketcher, n also has experience as she has been working with Sony n Disney, she also sang for films like Guzarish, Taare Zameen Par...

Rajeev Masand , the most disgusting person!!!😤😠😡

<a href="">41:46</a> The awkward silence for a sec  after he said that. OMG I am laughing so hard 😂😂

Saloni batra is meethi chhuri😅

Nobody&#39;s blaming them coz they were born in the family we are blaming them coz of their shitty acting skills 🥱🤮

<a href="">2:27</a>

don&#39;t  troll her ... she  is so innocent she thinks that the people are going into the theatre  to watch her..... maybe someone can correct her someday .... we went into the cinema halls to watch kartik and bhumi ...not her ...definitely  .... she did struggle a lot  in taking away that same role from Taapse .... she has struggled a lot ....  Going to Koffee with Karan was her biggest achievement  ..... and WE do  Appreciate that....

<a href="">41:47</a> ke baadh tara aur vishal ka reaction dekho tara was like: hmm m smj gayi😁 and vishal was like: m bhi yhi bolne wala tha and in <a href="">1:10:10</a> she was saying she was 2 and sid was like disgusted and vishal was like chup rhna sunn ne de 😂😂 sab mje le rhe the struggle ki devi ke 🤣🤣🤣

vishal jethwa seconds Siddharth.. just noticed..
The only thing is neither of them have ever struggled.

I went all through all the newcomers roundtable conducted by this man rajeev Masand and one thing I have observed is that star kids debutant get the seat on the table independent of the their performance but for outsiders if their performance is good then only they get to here .Isn&#39;t it his duty as a journalist to chose the debutant based on their performance .

Look, doctors aren&#39;t like you, doctors won&#39;t get second chance after a single mistake, then whoever his/her father or mother is, nobody can save him/her from losing his/he lisence...but that&#39;s not go with the nepotistic kids, if you flop 1movie you get another one.

<a href="">41:39</a>

It&#39;s seem like only bishal has understand what shiddhart said😂😂😂😂♥

<a href="">41:41</a> Ye lo Main Part Video Ka!😉
Why Ananya is in list , Getting all the attention to Ananya , huh!!! ..........................................................................................STRUGGLE

Eh lady ko keya lagti Hain coffee with Karan main Jana koiye oscar pane jesa Hain🤣🤣🤣🤣<a href="">#pandey</a> Sid be keya bola Hain 41:.47 sec😝🤣🤣
41.20 struggler

Just glad and happy to hear it <a href="">43:58</a>....✌😊

I request all too to ban these insider sycophants....watching these corrupt critics programs is a waste of our  precious time ....please ban them from you tube

Ananya Pandey be pretending like: what did he say I didn&#39;t get any of it

Vishal jethwa and Siddharth are gems of a person

It is amazing to see a new cast of emerging young stars in Bollywood equipped with focus, additional skills ad passion. I look forward to finding my favorite stars in this lot. It is a positive change from the past.

<a href="">41:25</a> &lt;i know u here only for this Struggle..

Annaya haven&#39;t appreciate vishal acting one time for his ego

<a href="">41:49</a> damn Vishal literally agrees with Siddharth 😂😂 because both of their struggle literally shows, amazing talent they both have.

How the hell did ananya get into USC or NYU? She is so dumb jus thrown around college names paise khilake ke daddy ke naam se?  Ughh wat a fake!

Rajeev mkbd
They didn&#39;t even invited Vardhan puri and Shivalekha 😫 they gave such an outstanding performance in YSA

I ❤ Tara sutaria
Everyone is calm except ananya😒also interfering in others answers tooMy Daaaaaaaaaaaaaad🤯😡

@ <a href="">25:25</a> I feel bad for vishal being stuck between these two chatters, must be so annoying. I am surprised ananya and tara are still alive after this interview and that sunny didnt come out of vishal lol

I&#39;m only here for the boys, especially vishal and siddhanth

no one said that tara was ugly.stop dragging her along with yourself

Annaya pandey&#39;s struggle starts at <a href="">40:09</a>

Here for Tara

I&#39;m here for Vishal Jethwa.. Damn he really scared me in mardaani. I really hated him from my guts, such was his acting. He deserves to get more recognition in Bollywood.

Ye mota masand h kya

Vishal jethwa is the best actor among them. I have seen his mardani 2 in theatre and he was really scary

Why is this so strange?
In this whole conference I found Vishal jetwa to be the real man❤

If u hv come for 1 liner just go to -<a href="">32:38</a> Nd thank me by liking😂😂

Shame on you Rajeev masand for publishing blind articles on our sushant...karma will  hit you back hard 😠😠😠😠😠 you are a big black spot on journalism

<a href="">

Rajib Masant a very bad,inhuman journalist.He is the main culprit for spreading fake news about newcomer.He supports nepotism.

Tara😍😍
R.I.P SUSHANT

Bs watch Ananya's movie.. Sali has not done acting but has kept her sisters as well.
After saying that line he regretted. And did not get a job 😅😅

Here for Vishal aur siddhant Mera Bhai.......

Damn! She actually thinks she can act. Forget about Method Acting and stuff, but she actually thinks she can act. I mean, I guess Vishal and Siddhant are screaming inside rofling. 😹

Here for vishal jethwa

4girls are sooo gamandi,,,ss

Ananya panday is  kalank of acting 😂😂😂😂😂

Banned this rajeev this is the worst person in this  planet
