1000 drone show coming ?

I just love the hardwork what they do and the outro sound of intel....I just loved it❤️❤️

Now it is made in India<a href="">

Now I know why people think aliens are visiting us!

I want it at my Diwali!!!!

Upgrade My_Account_id

This has to arrive in Brasília as soon as possible in 2021??? Artificial intelligence♾🇧🇷
Brasilia 2021 ♾ artificial intelligence!!!!!
I want to learn everything about drone light show. Is there any course for this?

Great job on Tokyo 2020

The drone is very well constructed.

All the dislikes from AMD freaks...

The difference between 100 and 500 isn&#39;t &quot;mindblowing&quot;.  It&#39;s 400......

Liar!!! The difference between 500 and 100 is not &quot;mind blowing&quot; its 400!!

please play bad apple with that

They mentioned 💯 drone in video and title mentioned 500 drone 😂!!! Intel bro tum bhi hamr le rahe ho 😂 keep it up

No intel technology involved in this

Presente

When the finals of Eurovision 2015 took place in Austria, there was an amazing display coordinated with separately controlled reflective spheres.  Can this kind of display be performed with these drones as well?

So ufo don’t exits
Who else is here to prove to someone that all the TikTok UFO videos are drone light shows

i9 10900k inside

That was very cool .

Hello, really good video, I wish you would continue making similar content... I will continue watching your creations. I send you a hug, see you later ❤️👍🏽
Man-0-Man, THAT is some AWESOME stuff right there!

what was the budget for the &#39;light and night show?&#39;

I just want to know how they charge them.

Now for new year instead of loud explosion all we hear are the whirring and humming of the drones.

AMD is better

Maybe it more safety than fireworks show

Where&#39;s the mothership

Next time.  Lets watch a cinema in the sky.   Making 10,000-20,000 drones flyes on the sky and make it like pixels

Im gonna start in my countrt

INSPIRED BY SPIDERMAN

Chinese already took the tech not new anymore

Mysterio is here

Can I please get a i9-9900k?

Looks great! And what control application is used in Intel 500 Drone Light Show?Thanks!

ohh shiet mysterio finna be real

Astounding...!

We’re waiting for 2500

Yeah... i buy you 800$ laptop yeah 30 fpsMy iphone is 60 fps wow i guest i should use mac book

501 drones, 1 is for the camera drone.

Mati love jujur mau gimana prank/suprice #1. They can tell something not serious for dead Skype country.

Could make a god out of those things 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ and control the weak minded

W

Future of ads

2019: <b>let&#39;s do 1000</b>
Intel is being smart by becoming a drone company since they&#39;re soon to be out of the CPU market.

Mysterio needs your location 🤣🤣🤣
Mysterio tech???
EDITH ? is that you , Mr Stark ?

Literally amazing!!!

Some lights are not working

Cool, but then it reminded me of military purpose and a new warfare age. A terrible one. Just as the inventor of the atombom

Woooow!!!!!!!

Wow!!!

DID INTEL MAKE TOO DRONES

You know something&#39;s off when a huge corporate logo is the highlight of the show.

<b>Intel inside</b>

If they can form a globe, they can form an attack pattern.

<a href="">2:13</a> &quot;Hisamitsu&quot;
How do we contact you guys about doing a light show?

Mysterio did that.

This is the first time I don&#39;t hear the INTEL&#39;s sound while the logo shows up in a video.

This would make for an excellent opening ceremony for any rich Olympic city

Are these UFOs (or IFOs)?

Vary beautiful

This video disappoints me.  It&#39;s a beautiful display, but this video doesn&#39;t discuss any of the technology.  The drone tech, the design, the software, possibilities for future use.  To be frank, this video is dumbed down.  It&#39;s a feel-good advertisement devoid of anything technically interesting.  Do they think we don&#39;t want to know?  We do!  Please, Intel, for the love of all that is good.  Talk to us about technical things -- amaze us with the genius behind the light show.

maybe is a simple i think for about made it too. and design ligth 5D.

New World Record is with EHang Co. Intel is a big time looser in 21st century. This era is not of MS Windows 95, that helped Intel to grow on its monopoly. No future of Intel for sure.

Should of put some drones with dangling led strips like shooting stars!

How i contact with intel for droon light show?

whats name of music in this video?

young nerd
COOL

There always at least one Indian in the group

Can we please do this for New Years Eve everywhere instead of the massively (air)polluting fireworks??

amazing
I guess our world does have some magic to it after all.

it turned out spectacularly

put some water on those, and go put those fires out!

I want to know what they could do with 10 k drones

Amazing.
Nice Weapon

Now its a question of making the drones smaller, brighter, and further responsive.Future challenge - Make a swarm of brighter 10000 LED drones with a size no more than 10 centimetres each, encased in a spherical Buckminsterfullerene like structure for protection. Then make them fly amongst the crowd.

MORE

Classic....!!!

Put the cell phones down. Remember this for the moment.

HOW DID I ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS NOW??? 2 Years Later??????? This is absolutely AWESOME!

When I think of world peace, I think of putting people first Xie Zongyan lst232
Roll&#39;s royce will test 3400 drones synchronized!

Amazing! We&#39;d like to do this in the DMV area. Let&#39;s chat!

I watched everyone of these Intel drone videos all I seen was a bunch of people talking and a two second light show

AMERICA!

I really want to experience this somewhere in the world.By the way, this video was fantastic and incredible to watch ;-)

Skynet + &#39;Shooting&#39; Stars 😂

&quot;Shooting&quot; stars . Right.

where/how can I buy a set?

better than fireworks

How long until someone calls this in as an alien invasion LOL.

Is this even real

Only 500 no way Intel China has flew more than 1000

10000

5000

2500

Next year 1000

Then 500

100

What? Only 100?

Awesome

But y though

Wow !! I have had dreams about this when I was a kid the intel ad in the sky.A true dream come true im very impressed.

awsome , good job intel guys

So all UFO capturing till now was just a Intel drones on the sky..... 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

Looks animated

Looks animated

&gt;never last year

&quot;the difference between 100 and 500 is.... Mind-blowing&quot;let me help, it&#39;s 400

Should put brighter lights on them and have them hover above you and follow you so it is always bright

I just want one drone!!

Cool

Ok, I want to buy 2000 of these.  Beats the crap outta catching fireflies.  Seriously cool.  Almost sci-fi looking.

When will Disney buy about 1,000 of these is my question

Still your stock fan suck
Wow

This is awesome

what you do when you make too much money....

faker then faker

Is this like a hive mind

later 500drones killing 1 whole cities

shoooooooooting staaaaaaar
They look like particles

give me one

SURPISE! all of those fladhing lighrs are actually indicating how long until the bombs that they are carrying denotante

500 drones get millions of views, but what about our bois in 10nm?

Ufologists please take note of this.

It doesn&#39;t look any interesting or amazing at all on the video - thanks the the super short cuts all the atmosphere vanishes totally

Just imagining commissioner Gordon having to drag these out every time he needs Batman....

Wow

God is not happy 👿

Better than fireworks! We wait for San Giovanni..
I&#39;d really like to learn what program their using to command &amp; configure all those drones =)

China flew 1000 already!
What is the way of contact with you?We want this performance

I loved! It beats fireworks by far! Creates a magical atmosphere!
You people are God.

next is world domination

awesome! Now you have less to worry about air pollution caused by fireworks.
Thanks developer
I found it weak
King God Tel

How to take something that should be amazing and mind-blowing and turning it into just another politically correct boring run-of-the-mill commercial. I&#39;m very disappointed☹️

now replace de led light bulb with its weight on C4 and you will see the true market for this technology

Hello.
Intel sets a world record? Yes, but only with 20 more drones! There was 1180 drones performance in the sky of Guangzhou during FGF( Fortune Global Forum)  06/12/2017. The pre-recorded show in PyeongChang is a good one nonetheless.

Its just the beginning of police drone swarms harassing innocent civilians

How do you manage with lipo charging? :)

This tec is used in pyeongchang olympic with korean telecom tec

Pity the art is lost in the advertising.

Charge the batteries - you can hang yourself right away
FFFFFFUUUUUUTTTTUUUURRREE Squidward
mind blowing it is!  👍

What I saw in Pyeongchang
THIS WILL BE USED TO CONTROL ALL OF HUMANITY:  BIGGER DRONES ARE ALLREADY CONTROLING OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD :::THEY ARE MAKING YOU PAY FOR YOUR ONWN INSLAVEMENT ::::AND ITS FUNNY HOW NOBODY IS CRITICAL ABOUT THIS :

wonderful!!!!
Thaks for PyeongChang!

Love the future!

Pyeongchang cyberpunk stay...
5 months working for 5 minutes

Me: Whos going to charge all of those batteries?

This seems a path to something magic, when the energy source is revolutionized and the artificial intelligence is developed.

It&#39;s all fun and games now...but i see them soon, strapted with some bombs by some lunatics.

Next challenge 100,000 drones.

Blow my mind some more. 👽

Can it run on my 486?

It is wonderful!!!
Well this is just disturbing.

why only white and blue????????????

now put 2000 :)

This has me feeling old, I&#39;ve arrived in the future somehow.

Impressive, but after the Meltdown patch, will the drones fly 30% slower, or just 10%?

How they communicate with each other through a single console?

<a href="">1:09</a> &quot; special feathering"?
Wow they are amazing light from drones.

Human thought is brilliant. Amazing.
amd can not handle even 2 drones :D

Are drones communicating with each other or they are controlled by a centralized ground control system?

Love It!

Humm let&#39;s put some RGB lasers on these drones , OK now that could get interesting

<a href="">

Yes, but there are 1180 drones operated in Guangzhou last week...

or how to spend money for nothing

Is there a way to contact them?

What is this supposed to tell me about Intel?

digital fireworks

500

Nothing special

Awesome wok!

This is next level shit.

love them drones good war all manner of things as the Iraqi people and the Palestinians

Scared a lot of people xD look like UFOs

Its Canada?

Hi guys , how can I get hold of you for an event ?

intel the best.! see you soon , I hope so

So amazing...
Godamn! Feels like in the future

1000 drones at 2017 new year event.<a href="">

best processing stuff man!!!!!
Awesome!  We filmed it! Here is the Light Show video!

Aliens

Just watch, next thing you know fireworks are gonna be talking about how drones took their jobs lol

a friend of mine got his drone and killed it going full trottle to the wall in 5 sec so yeah you guys are doing better

imagine a floating screen in the sky? Like show video threw the drones? There is a ton of potential with this

EASY TO BREAK GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS  WHEN YOUR BUDGET IS AS HIGH AS THE MOON

I wanna watch &quot;999-Drones&quot;

FAKE IT IS A COMMERCIAL STUNT

Well, impressive video.  however, in the early days of computing you would be shown how to build a radio, a 555 timer circuit or shift register.  Where O where is the sharing of this technology?  Educate the world used to be the motto of large organisations, building the interest of a new generartion of engineers.  Appears now to be all about developing a need to make an extra $.  Steve jobs really needed a trillion dollars to himself; no wonder the schools, roads, parks, hospitals, libraries are in such a state!  Still hoard another buck and the world will be a better place i&#39;m sure.  Come on intel, break the mould and educate the world.  Now thats a real challenge rather than sitting in an armchair made of dollar bills.

I seriously hope one of Intel&#39;s engineers uses this to propose.

Every one of them can carry a handgranade. Now imagine 100 Million or one Billion of drones...

CU on UFO´s are real

No wonder intel cpu&#39;s are overpriced, they need to finance their toys.

who come here because of asian games 2018 in Indonesia ?

Wow

would be better to view in 4K ....Intel come on

I want to hear the buzzing

so these are not Ufo? lol

When Intel does it it&#39;s ok and fun and all that, when aliens do it it&#39;s &quot;UFO!! Call 911!!&quot;

and this concept shows on in indonesia countdown asian games 2018

You would not believe your eyes, if 500 intel drones, lit up the sky as you watched them light up the sky

whats the technology behind this? neural networks?

Amazing, smart
wow very good show. i also make video about 300 drones performance in Singapore National Day

War thunder AA so op it could literally kill every drone in 10 shots

Amazing
I want one of this drone

dudegalaga in mid air

The only thing I find fascinating is the drones coordination, that&#39;s some really accurate moves even for a drone, GPS can&#39;t do evrything, interesting.

i bet they will do 1000 by this year

300 drone for Asian games countdown in jakarta ? Can&#39;t wait

no more fireworks, just this.. :)

omg I&#39;m a big fan of intel go intel intel hope u do more do well keep the good work intel is the intel Pentium is good that my pc right now well cya

Mashaa Allah.....
great!

That was EPIC!

New Years eve is all i am sayin

It would be great to use it for a science show, to illustrate how stars orbits in a galaxy, the formation of a solar system or how galaxies interact with each other.

Can we put this in the Philippines? Where I can contact someone who can do it here in PH?

which company did this drone production ?

And then all the drones become red and start chasing people lol

2000 angry bees making my ears bleed

Good stuff!
One of the most beautiful things I&#39;ve ever seen

No more UFO anymore :(  .

The future of fireworks shows, how awesome that would be right?

We&#39;re all gonna to die.

10,000 Fireflies is literally possible now

Congratulations

Allah....so awesome !

realy good

So...They develop all the drones, make that one show, and then...throw all the drones in the trash?

You caaaan watch Dronee here <a href="">
Crazy dick
wait. its the intel pi piri pipiri (a shooting star xdd)

i&#39;ll be really impressed when it can play mine craft. ;)

so they used drones as 3d pixels

my friends cousin works for intel

Just ... WOW!!!

It makes me mad that I&#39;ll never be able to afford these things

this is super awesome! amazing

What software do they use to control the drones?

extraordinary

make 999,trillion drones and sent it to thee GOD&#39;S!!!!!!! hehehe

aliens would visit again 10/10

That image in the guys camera in <a href="">1:55</a> seems fake

<a href="">2:13</a> its a satisfactory sound

CHINA BEAT YOU THEY DID 1000 DRONES

Very beautiful. One of the best scene w/o CGI.

Art!?This is OBVIOUSLY being developed for military purposes.

Why don&#39;t all drones have cages?..

Each drone containing i7 processor :D ?
This is Retarded! ... what is the Point of it?

cmon we wanna 1000!!!

Hey, that&#39;s pretty good!

Next goal 5000?

I saw it in Science Boy, a children's science magazine, and scanned the QR code and wow, it's amazing!
this is a really good video :)
gr8 👍
oh my god!!!!!
Intel developing fleet of drones. Yeah lad, they&#39;re making them to deliver me pizza... :v

expencive toy for stupid idiots

Praise GodIntel (i7 Kaby Lake owner)
fake

China is always over doing things... You did 500 drones and they just did 1000... Hmmm... China...

Why is difference between 100 and 500 mindblowing? Cant exactly the same software handle 500 as handled 100?

...but why?

Reminds me of Ferngully at the end...

it&#39;s unbelivable beauty
The drones and the programming for the remote control for the swarm is out of this world. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!

amazing Intel....you are amazing, Intel
We have the solution to all the theories of people who saw lights in the sky
boom boom boom boom boom ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! too scary
I have a proposal for a park in Dubai back in 2008 with such ideas...in fact mine was a bit ahead of these guys...i used those drone like objects to generate their own power from sun and wind..you would be able to see these here...<a href=""> href="">

What if it was superwindy at the time of Superbowl? Would the drone show have been cancelled? I dont think that light copters can take much wind...

This is not mind blowing AT ALL ! just a simple 3D triangulation / positioning used with radio strength beacon  a technology in every Iphone now - or Ibeacon - a strong wind and all go to disarray ! they don&#39;t communicate with each other - one beacon down and all is a mess.

Yes! NOW LET PUT GUNS ON THEM! c:

I am amazed, I love lights!
This is how Skynet will murder us all.

Skynet.

I want to buy a fleet

Daniel can get it

I wonder how they conquer the battery change issue for a mass number of drones.

UFO sightings are about to go up heheh

How sick would this be for a New Years/4th of July fireworks (&quot;drone works&quot;) display be!  Intel.....start planning now!!

<a href="">0:50</a> Pewds? Is that you?

That just has to make you smile

HOLOGRAMS. Like, really big, low res holograms, but still, holograms. That&#39;s basically what I&#39;m seeing. Imagine this concept in 20 more years with 5X more drones that are even more compact? You&#39;ve seen ads on banners pulled behind prop planes. Imagine 2500 drones buzzing overhead telling you to buy Trojan lol

New fireworks

This would be so much better than fireworks for 4th of July!

Who else is here thx to Philip De Franco?

I would love to see this at a theme park like before or after a firework show.

Does anyone know what piece of music is playing until <a href="">0:22</a>?

345600 FOR SD 2073600 FOR hd 8294400 FOR 4Kbetter get to work guys ...
It&#39;s the Seeker Swarms from Mass Effect 3!!!!!!!!

Now make it 5000

This did not happen during the superbowl -_- this happened over a week ago. and was pre-recorded.

I have a dream, write it in the sky as I love my partner. you help me?

cool！
Awesome! I have a lot of doubts about it. I want to do the same show, but it for the anniversary foundation school when I study.

Thanks for sharing.

superbowl

Me and everyone else in my family thought the stars and flag was all CGI, but then at the end of the halftime show they had a little picture on the screen and they said &quot;Drones sponsored by Intel&quot;. I was like, &quot;THOSE ARE DRONES? OMG!&quot;

In a couple of years this drones will be used to show the countdown of the new year. And ads, lots of ads

im here from the superbowl halftime

implement CREE XM-L T6  on every drone and have a local SUN. I know, we&#39;ll see that soon

amazing
Amazing &amp; Wonderful
soon we will have thousands of these in micro form to make a jumbo screen in the sky to watch movies and stuff. this could be the future of holograms.

Fireworks Display 2.0

That super bowl drone setup was SO COOL guys... damn.

The future of fireworks

Now imagine producing millions of these drones and filling up the night sky over an entire city.

now Geico can advertise aerial banners at night 🙃

Great to see the innovation and safety!

Super Bowl drones on Feb 5, 2017 were filmed before the Super bowl due to FAA regulations.   <a href="">

Very beautiful! Great and very creative! ~
so its confirmed UFO is actually drone from future all along?

You know maybe you could kill a president with a swarm of these and a small C4 charge on each one....

Turns out UFO sightings were just Time Travelers playing with their drone fleets.

Drones taking over your job fireworks.

&quot;The difference between 100 and 500 is mindblowing.&quot;According to my research, it&#39;s about 5 times less. <a href="">#ididthemath</a>

used for Half Time Show

I want to see this stuff at disneyland every night ASAP

Really cool!

but the battery life has too be extremely long...

I saw this on the Superbowl and thought it was CGI but when I found out it was real... I still can&#39;t believe it.

chime in if you&#39;re here because of the half time show.  :)

Went here after Lady Gaga&#39;s Half Time Show.
wheres drone 1000

they should have put these in the shape of an Illuminati symbol that would have freaked someone out.

INTELLIGENCE drones dancing ALL round the Worldwide billions of jobs in the worldwide

lady gaga super bowl 2017
Gaga brought us here. Show us more, show us an awesome show!

Gaga use this for superbowl omg WIG

GAGA SB

Yep they are doing the Super Bowl can&#39;t wait

This it will happen at the Super Bowl 2017!!!Lady Gaga will slay!!

Gagaaaaaa

Gaga at the Super Bowl 😍

Gaga

So i heard this wiill be used on the SuperBowl Halftime show with Gaga? I&#39;m not surprised since Gaga and Intel have partnered a couple of times now

Lady Gaga will wear it to the Super Bowl, just don't see anyone who doesn't want it.
GAGA AT THE SUPER BOWL!!!

LADY GAGA SUPER BOWL 2017

GAGA SUPERBOWL 51

wow !

WHat kind of witchcraft is this

Watch Disneyland put these shows on in a couple of years. You heard it HERE first. 👉😎👉

swarm one of these over the Whitehouse and see what reactions you&#39;re gonna get from the guards

INTEL IS LIFE AND FUTURE !!

Best ufo sighting so far!
woooooooooooooow

If everyone believes that INTEL is responsible for the red orbs and daytime triangles etc ....get ready .....cause they can be imitated but drones fly ...UFOS materialize yUFOS don&#39;t make sound are as big as cars and they DONT FLY they don&#39;t bank they don&#39;t have alighted fixtures similar to any of these displays . I cant believe the arrogance . So intel ....when can we expect to see your drones show up in a random location after being signaled at a random location at a random time? Obviously you haven&#39;t seen the real thing and it frustrates you enough to create the fake UFOS yourself huh? How about the ones that have been seen in space by astronauts? Are they crazy too? UFOS are real ! Get used to it.peace christo

Nice. Make a million of those drones and have a km long screen. The future is here

Swarm of army drones when?

only 4k likes wtf

AWESOME! Now fake a alien invasion!

Wow, what a creative idea.

Intell knows how to spend their money.

I know it would be a bit of a hack but why not have 4 LEDs on each drone so in certain configurations you can have a much higher resolution?

blue beam project

SKYNET just few years...

how did you do it?
OMG. Is  that possible?

well this is freaky as i was going to share this link last night to a ufo sight as i dont think everyone is aware how awsome and clever these drones are. people have designed flying cars!! drone gps flying machines  capable of 200mph yes technology just took a giant leap. at last.

WHAT A HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AND RESEARCH... IM SURE THE &quot;FLEET&quot; WAS MADE IN CHINA AND WHO ARE THOSE ALIENS WHO BEARLY SPEAK ENGLISH

I think I could make hologram-like stereoscopic images with more drones.
crying because I will not get 1,000 likes

So great...I can see the future.So great!!We can see our futures.We will fly soon.. no more ground cars
do you have a full light show video

2D video wouldn&#39;t do this justice

lady gaga really need these at the superbowl next year!!!

Hello, Could you please help me find the person to talk to regarding the Drone Light Show services as pertains to events?

During the next candlelight vigil, please do a drone show over the Blue House demanding Park Geun-hye step down.
i could single handedly write the AI for the drones using both my hands.

why just a 2min video of this? :(

that was pretty cool! But not as cool as my droning videos! check them out! lol

fabuloso!

<a href="">0:40</a> The difference between 100 and 500 is actually 400...

Waoow...

where is the 500 Drone Light Show ?

Cant wait until millions of these things in swarms with military hardware are hacking cities and major infrastructure.  Fun times.

well done !
Anybody knows, what mark of drones are using here?Help pls!)

What if the batteries run out?

Beautiful time to live in

Amazing!
mind blowing

preparing us for the alien landing

coming soon......Sky Television.....
I&#39;m trying to know the ost of this video. Would you tell me a name of this music?

And we thought UFOs exists... They are all drones being tested by NASA...

Call me when you can screen a full movie while drones are flying in the air.  It shouldn&#39;t be so hard... I imagine you keep them flying with different LED colors adjusted for the movie, which change as required by it.  It would make it really nice if they can be on a 3D array.  That would be a step up for entertainment.

hello! my english is not good! So, were can I find this drons. how it cost/ I leave in Ukraine, where can I buy it?

<b>Goodjob Intel &lt;3</b>

hmm, the show really was better last time.Rather do something internet-y, like surprising a loved one by bringing a sky of stars to a cloudy night sky and watch their eyes light up?come on intel, you got these drones, now do something nice with them :)flying 500 drones may be cool, but until you really explain what the difficulty is, when just flying more drones, then this is hardly recognizable as a big thing. to me it looks like you just took 500 drones instead of 100 and let them do a thing.i just watched the 100 drone video again: that video deserves to be on the internet. quite a shame that this video here seems to overtake your first one soon...

WOW!

I wonder how does it sound.

Music Festivals... EDC, Coachella, Tomorrowland, Bonnarroo... Twinkle Twinkle..
waoh magnificent

Meanwhile, in Russia they organized mass cowpat throwing competitions. A symmetrical answer so to speak
great!!!!!

We have finally discovered all the secret to all of the hoax alien videos.

They should show this on next Olympic opening ceremony. Digital Fireworks.

I think it&#39;s a great idea !We will see more UFO !! ?   :-)

RESPECT &amp; LIKE :-) :-) :-)

disneyland needs to get on that instead of fireworks show

magnificent coordination for a very beautiful show and an astonishing landing at 500 light units, very good digital control, hats off.
Decent!
Crazy, hopefully one day we can get drones/ lasers/ fireworks and holograms together in one big PSYCHOACTIVE REALITY

These shows should come to Oklahoma. Or Texas. I&#39;d pay to watch. Live music too. And wine.

gigantic ad

Awesome

the difference between 500 and 100 i think its 400

the future of special affects for ufo in movies and pranks in person.

Fantastic, great work Intel.

we live in the future.... i am glad i was born in the 90s.....

THAT&#39;S AMAZING

awsome!

amazing
Bet those Dubai folks will implement this kind of show soon, especially for their annual new year light show.

Walt Disney World will be doing something like this, this year at Disney Springs

very cool!

congratulations !!!

Wooow! This is awesome! I wonder about the logistics involved - i.e. the software. They must&#39;ve come up with something high-level that simplifies this tremendously. Have some low-level routines constantly and automatically keeping watch on the individual drones status, actual flying controls, collision prevention, etc., - with the high-level stuff basically being &quot;draw this 3-D shape with your fingers on the screen, then draw another one, and all the drones transition from one shape to another&quot;. Or not :) In any case, this is seriously awesome stuff.

Save on fireworks.... better for the environment....? Haha

The difference between 100 and 500 is &#39;x5&#39;. Not &#39;Mindblowing&#39; by any means, unless you&#39;re simple... Thumbs down

So any bets on 1000 drones 1017? That is something I&#39;d love to see.

A great Guinness World Record for Intel

woooooooooooooooooow!!!!!       .-.

how did they controlled that amount of drones. software driven predetermined flight paths?

Nice.

next gen firework
Wow... It&#39;s marvelous...!
Marvelous!
its so incredibly magical and looks like the units from the game Auralux or the small &quot;flies&quot; that the mothership in StarCraft is spreading, so nice .....

Cool!!
Imagine the task it would be to charge all 500 after the event lol

MindBlowing !

Look at the very bottom of the screen at exactly <a href="">02:00</a>. During the landing, it looks like 1 of the drones malf&#39;d and flew off into the trees. It moves from the center to the left on a line parallel to the ground, and then disappears into some trees. Still, even with 499 drones, this is damned impressive.

the music in the background?

Amazing just amazing would love to see this. Just a shame they used windows 10 on the laptop controlling all those drones, what could possibly go wrong. bsod in sky that would be mad or the drones mirror the text updating 49% failed reverting changes lol.

What is the music at <a href="">1:30</a>

Next time 2,073,600 drones in sky  for 1080 HD  and then 8,294,400 for 4K, 33,177,600 too much?

Can use it on Olympic opening ceremony.. LOL
