LirikPutting my defenses up&#39;Cause I don&#39;t wanna fall in loveIf I ever did that, I think I&#39;d have a heart attackNever put my love out on the lineNever said yes to the right guyNever had trouble getting what I wantBut when it comes to you, I&#39;m never good enoughWhen I don&#39;t care, I can play &#39;em like a Ken dollWon&#39;t wash my hair, then make &#39;em bounce like a basketballBut you make me wanna act like a girlPaint my nails and wear high heelsYes, you make me so nervous that I just can&#39;t hold your handYou make me glowBut I cover up, won&#39;t let it showSo I&#39;m putting my defenses up&#39;Cause I don&#39;t wanna fall in loveIf I ever did that, I think I&#39;d have a heart attackI think I&#39;d have a heart attackI think I&#39;d have a heart attackNever break a sweat for the other guysWhen you come around, I get paralyzedAnd every time I try to be myselfIt comes out wrong like a cry for helpIt&#39;s just not fair, pain&#39;s more trouble than love is worthI gasp for air, it feels so good, but you know it hurtsBut you make me wanna act like a girlPaint my nails and wear perfume for youMake me so nervous that I just can&#39;t hold your handYou make me glowBut I cover up, won&#39;t let it showSo I&#39;m putting my defenses up&#39;Cause I don&#39;t wanna fall in loveIf I ever did that, I think I&#39;d have a heart attackI think I&#39;d have a heart attackI think I&#39;d have a heart attackThe feelings got lost in my lungsThey&#39;re burning, I&#39;d rather be numb (rather be numb)And there&#39;s no one else to blame (no one else to blame)So scared, I take off, and I runI&#39;m flying too close to the sunAnd I burst into fla-fla-flamesYou make me glowBut I cover up, won&#39;t let it showSo I&#39;m putting my defenses up&#39;Cause I don&#39;t wanna fall in loveIf I ever did that, I think I&#39;d have a heart attackI think I&#39;d have a heart attack (heart attack)I think I&#39;d have a heart attack-tackI think I&#39;d have a heart attack (oh, I think I&#39;d have a heart attack)I think I&#39;d have a heart attack

Beautiful song
This song is a show, it&#39;s crazy, I love it

Is this lady from a Mexican family? She looks like a Mexican. Mexicans have all the same face. She is only less ugly because she is rich and can afford taking care of herself. But is still being fat sometimes.

What happened to this demi 

This is just like when Portugal won in 2017, people wanted Bulgaria to win, but more people appreciated Portugal. Why can’t people just stop complaining that Turkey didnt win? It was literally years ago, more people liked Lena, so what? Manga was also good, but not every wish comes true ya know.

Simply prft
Hi, came back from 10 years later. Welcome to 2024!

I played Minecraft listening to this
so is she looking for the great guy.. or just a woke indo byotich

OMG. I have just broken up with my 10- year BF. Then I have just met a guy and had a crush on him.This song is for me now.I really like him but don’t wanna fall in love, I dont wanna loose him.But everytime i meet him, I am very conflictedHe makes me want to fall in love again, which I dont really want after the breakup.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa“

I love this song such a Great voice

Heart Attack I put my defenses up Because I don't want to fall in love If I did I think I'd have a heart attack I never put my love on a line I never said yes to the right guy I never had a problem getting what I want But when it comes from you I'm never good enough When I don't care You can play with them like a Ken I won't wash my hair And I'll make them bounce like a basketball But you make me want to act like a girl Paint my nails and wear heels Yeah, you make me feel so nervous I can't hold your hand You make me shine But I hide it, I won't show it So I put my defenses up 'Cause I don't want to fall in love If I did that, I think I'd have a heart attack I think I'd have a heart attack I think I'd have a heart attack I think I'd have a heart attack I never sweated for any other guy When you get close, I freeze And every time I try to be myself Everything gets bad and I scream for help It's just not fair It's trouble but it's worth it Gasping for air It feels so good, but you know it hurts But you make me want to act like a girl Paint my nails and wear perfume For you, you make me feel so nervous I can't hold it your hand You make me shine But what I hide, I won't show So I put my defenses up Because I don't want to fall in love If I did that, I think I would have a heart attack I think I would have a heart attack I think I would have a heart attack I think I would have a heart attack Feelings are lost in my lungs They're burning, I'd rather be bad And there's no one to blame I'll shake off my fear and run I'm flying close to the sun And I'm going to burst into flames You make me shine But I hide it, I won't show it So I put my defenses up Because I don't want to fall in love If I did that I think I would have a heart attackI think I would have a heart attackI think I would have a heart attackI think I would have a heart attackI think I would have a heart attack
